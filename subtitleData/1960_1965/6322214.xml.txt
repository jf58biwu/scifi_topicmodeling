 Do you read me ? Do you read me ? ! Someone , please come in ! My god , my god ! Dr. Weitzberg , contact range officer . Paging system now secured for emergency use only . 46 hours , 20 minutes , 0 seconds . Space Operations , Florida division . Hold on . It 's the press . What do we tell them , Steve ? I 'll tell you what to tell ' em . Tell ' em we sent our second man to the Moon ... And looks like he 's not coming back , either . I 'm sorry , Donna ... I shouldn 't have said that . We can release no statement at this time . Oxygen countdown . Mr. Curan would like a countdown on the oxygen ... Every 15 seconds . 2 minutes , 30 seconds . No contact for 9 full hours . Same thing all over again ! Same thing all over again . Yet the whole rig is clicking like a dream . 2 minutes , 15 seconds . We licked every problem ... Put a man on the Moon . No , we got him off . Everything worked fine , but Lockhart . What happened to him ? 2 minutes , 0 seconds . Mr. Curan 's desk . Yes sir , one moment . The White House . No , not now . No . - 1 minute , 45 seconds . - Mr. Curan feels certain that there 's ... No hope for capt . Lockhart . Yes sir . 1 minute , 30 seconds . You alright ? - 1 minute , 15 seconds . - How 's our boss holding up ? Barrenger ? Well , as usual he 's not said a word . I wouldn 't get too close to him , if I were you . I was figuring on giving him a sedative . 60 seconds . Ready ? Who isn 't ? - It isn 't over yet . - Will be in about 60 seconds . Well ... We 've done it your way , twice . Well , now , we don 't pretend to know all the answers . Apparently , no one does . For every frontier that 's been explored ... - Men have died . - 45 seconds . We 've only lost 2 men on the strangest frontier of all . There are millions of people in this world , Dr. Weitzberg . But there are only 4 men left who can handle the lunar rocket . We 've lost 1 / 3 of the men we had . It 's like a conveyor tube to oblivion . - Mr. Barrenger ... - 30 seconds . The situation that happened to those first 2 men ... Was not only duplicated but widely exaggerated in their training . Those men did not have a mental crackup . I 'd stake my life on it . There is no duplicate for the solitude of space ! If those men could 've looked in their viewing screen ... And seen 2 , 3 or more sister ships alongside ... - 15 seconds . - Out there ... they wouldn 't have panicked ! You heard those tapes . Those men did not panic ! - The next time , we do it my way . - 10 , 9 ... - 8 , 7 , 6 ... - The remaining 4 men in mass flight . - 5 , 4 ... - Well , then , do it without me . - 3 , 2 ... - The mass flight takes place next month . - We 'll talk about it ! - 1 , 0 . Oxygen , depleted . Damn ! I 'll see you in Washington ... tomorrow . Steve ... Think he knew about Don and Mel Lockhart ? I don 't know , doc . If he did , I doubt if it 'd make much difference . Steve , might as well write off 4 more men . I can 't take much more of this , doc . I wonder how he can justify it ? Our boss is the secretary of Space Operations . And that cabinet post ... Entitles him to be a very daring man . Well , we gotta stop him , doc . Alright , Steve , before you go see him tomorrow , stop by my office . I don 't get it . I just don 't get it ! The pattern is the same as before . Perfect take-off . Clear contact all the way . Perfect landing . You heard Lockhart when he was on the lunar surface . Lift-off from the Moon , perfect ! 1 hour later , nothing ! And we had him right here , doc ! If he wanted to talk to us he didn 't even have to push a lousy button ! Do you read me ? Do you read me ? ! Lockhart ... X-20 approaching ionosphere . Someone , please , come in ! My god , my god ! X-20 to Moon blat . Do you read me ? ! Lockhart ? This is Moon blat . Curan , Steve Curan . Come in , X-20 . Steve ... It 's coming on again . My god ... My god ! Kill . Kill ! Doc ... what 's wrong with that man ? I don 't know , Steve . This is doc Weitzberg . How long have you been without oxygen ? 15 , maybe ... 20 minutes . It 's impossible ! Why did you break contact ? Wouldn 't let make contact . Please ... Kill ... No , no ! Oh , don 't ... - Steve ... - I ... I can 't make it ... Lost control . Push red ... Push the red ... I can 't push that red button , that 'll blow him up . Way off course . Can 't make it . No , no ! Something ... makes my arm move . Makes me ... do things . Kill , kill ! Doctor , we 've got to help him . I 'm 200.000 feet ! Push the red ... Something in me ... Push the red ... Why do you want us to push it ? You can push it , if you want to . Won 't let me . I can 't move my arm ! Kill ! Kill ! 165.000 . Push the red ... No more time ! What 's his position , where is he ? Inland . Populated area ... California . 140.000 . Push the red ! Kill ! My god ! My god , Steve , help me ! Help me ! Push the red ... 70.000 ! Push it ... ! My ... my god ! God , Steve , help me ! Help me ! Push the red ... 70.000 ! Push it ! Well , that 's one tape we don 't want Donna to transcribe . Don 't worry , I 'll take care of it . How can a man continue to function without oxygen for 20 minutes ? Can 't . Lockhart did . So , we know ... Something kept him functioning . A substitute for oxygen ? I don 't know , Steve . But ever since we lost Nelson ... An idea 's been buzzing around in my brain , like a fly . A very persistent fly . After hearing Lockhart the buzzing stopped . Ya know , I think I 've hit on something . Wanna hear it out with me ? Go ahead , have at it . Well , I think what kept Lockhart going , was life . An independent vital force ... Something ... living . Well , that 's pretty wild , doc . Well , " living " covers a lot of territory , Steve . And I don 't think Lockhart was alone ... On his return flight any more than Nelson was . Oh , now , doc ... I 'm not talking about little , green men . As a matter of fact , I may not talk at all unless I get some encouragement . Well , what do you need , uh , a drink , maybe ? No ... time . And you 're the one that can get Barrenger to give it to me . Time ? For what ? Time , to prove that this force , this ... " new life " was born on the X-20 . Go ahead . I need you with me all the way , Steve . Alright , I 'm with you . What makes life ? A certain , particular combination of molecules ... Or carbon , or silicone , or nitrogen . Or any number of these things . A certain temperature . Mix well , call it what you will , but this mass ... Swirling together in tiny orbits , fuses these things into a ... Precise energy relationship which we call " life . " Ah , now , wait a minute . What you 're saying is that , uh ... in space ... Life might mutate , or ... Even fully evolve in a matter of hours , or ... even minutes . What happens when we send a man up there ? You see , see ... we don 't just send a man in a rocket . We send up living cells , molecules , bacteria , germs . We throw in radioactivity . We introduce all these to cosmic rays . Do we upset this balance ? Do we start a cycle ? Does a living cell from Earth romance a cosmic ray ... And give birth to an illegitimate monster who makes his nest in ... In Lockhart and Nelson ? It 's beginning to add up , isn 't it ? Perhaps it was weakening , maybe dying ... Anything evolving so rapidly couldn 't live very long . Well , Steve ? Quite a chunk . Ah , throw out the logic pills when you swallow it ! This theory can 't be measured by anything we already know . - Sounds like a good case . - I was hoping you 'd say that . Barrenger won 't . He won 't go for a theory even if it 's true . Then lie to him ! But buy me the time . No dancing . No dancing ! Not allowed . No dancing ! No dancing , not allowed . No rats , not allowed . Marta , how can you stand those things ? And you are gonna be a nurse , Patsy ? ! Well , what are you doing with them ? I picked them up at the Express Office for grandpa . They 're for the lab at school . Well , maybe your grandfather 's a biology professor ... And your boyfriend 's a pre-med student ... But my father 's the sheriff and rats and the law don 't mix . Voil√† ! No rats . Hey , you didn 't bite ! When I said " boyfriend . " You mean , Paul ? Then he isn 't just a mutual interest in hives and chicken pox ! He 's very nice . But how did you hook him ? I know a dozen girls who tried . The " lone wolf , " they call him . Well , I 'm not saying you 're not stacked , but he 's just not with it . We 're just good friends . Eat , drink and be merry ... for tomorrow you die . You think I 'm kiddin ' , huh ? Didn 't you see that thing last night ? No ! I didn 't see anything . Well , I phoned your father . Why , there was a fireball in the sky as big as a house . He didn 't see it either . Well ... what do you think it was ? Didn 't I tell ya ? Eat , drink and be merry ... Tomorrow you die . And now , for your local news here at Palms , California . The traffic commission has decided ... Hi ! - Hi Paul . - Hi Paul . Come on , sit down beside me . Come on , finish your milk , let 's get going . Can we stop by my house ? What for ? It 's getting late . I gotta pick up my bathing suit . But I told you I 'd meet you here , you said you 'd have your suit with you ! I forgot it . I just can 't get used to going swimming at Christmas time . Well , I can tell you one thing ... What 's that ? It 's for real ... you sound like a married couple already . Come on , finish your milk , let 's go . Alright ! Ok ? I gotta take ... drop things at home for grandpa , anyhow . Ok , let 's get a m-move on . - Bye , Patsy . - Bye Patsy . Goodbye , you two lovebirds . Hey , Paul ... What are they sayin ' over at the school about that thing in the sky last night ? Nothin ' , why ? Everybody said it was a meteor . Hey , come on ! Don 't tell me you 're still scared of them flying ' saucers ? Eat , drink and be merry . Hi , children . Hi . Picked it up for you at the Express Office . - Thank you , thank you , dear . - I love you , grandpa . Gotta run ! Hello there , mr . Farnstrom . I never will understand how you do it . What 's that , sir ? It 's 15 minutes past the last bell ... And already , you 're off somewhere with my granddaughter . Well , we have a system , sir . A secret system . Secret ... Paul ... you keep things too much to yourself . In science , you must learn that you have to share . To work together , to accept help . Not me , professor . When I make it , I 'll make it on my own . All the way . What did I tell you ? Breaking the speed laws ! Going swimming ! I 'll be back in time to make dinner . Swimming ? Where ? swimming ? That 's our secret , sir . Our secret place . You can 't object to go swimming , grandpa ! That 's ? You look at me like this , I can 't object to anything this safe . Bye . - Bye , bye . - Love you . Got your suit ? - Bye ! - Bye . Bye ... I wonder if they will come to good to science as much as you will . Are you hurt ? Only my pride ! Poor boy ! The sensitive male ego ... so easily wounded . I think I know now the secret of how to be successful with a woman . You do ? Tell me ! You have to be weak , pathetic . Then they feel sorry for you . I think you discovered it . I know I have . I always wondered why some spindly , little runts had the girls chasing ' after ' em . Because they felt sorry for ' em . Of course . But you were fooling me ! You 're not weak . Darn right . Now I 've got you . Paul ... I guess I 'm not like those other women . I don 't like weak men at all . Listen ... will you once and for all give me a serious answer ? What about ? Are you going home , to Sweden ... after the semester 's over ? Why not ? I only planned to come to California for a year . To see grandfather ... to go to an American school for a while ... Nothing has come up to change my plans . Whaddya mean ? What about me ? No ... I planned there would be a boy , too ! Why you little ... ! Don 't come any closer ! I 've nothing on . Faker ! You haven 't had time to undress . Maybe I didn 't ... But I have now ! Ok ! You win . You know ... I don 't think your grandfather approves of me . You 're wrong ! He considers you the best student in his class . I meant as a member of the family . What do I have to do , say it in Swedish ? Paul ? What does it mean I 'm " stacked " ? And you 're " not with it " ? Stacked ? Where 'd you hear that ? Patsy . This afternoon . She must 've seen you in that suit ! Is something wrong ? Yeah ... I 'm having non-clinical thoughts . ? me or not ? How do you say it in Swedish ? Say what ? ! Nothin ' ... let 's hit the water . You know something ? American men marry much too young . You know something ? It 's because of Swedish girls like you . But Donna , I 've called everywhere and haven 't been able to find him ! Didn 't he say where he was going ? No ... he was quite upset when he left . He banged on the typewriter for a while ... he was in a mood . I 've gotta talk to him right away , it 's urgent ! When he acts like this , he wants to be alone . Well , this is the one time he shouldn 't be alone . Doc , you 've got me worried . I didn 't mean to scare you , this is a matter of the gravest importance . I 'll try . I 'll be here until I hear from you . And Donna ... everything alright ? - Yes , doc . - Good . - Bye . - Goodbye . Boy , that water was cold ! Alright ... now ! Now what ? The answer . - Answer ? - That 's right . What answer ? You gonna stay here ? Well , why should I do that ? So I can marry you , stupid ! Marry me ? Oh , good ! Paul , Paul ! Take me away , please ! Sure , baby , sure . Marta ... Let me go back for it , I 'll lock it in the trunk of the car . No , no , I couldn 't stand it ! Let 's go right to the sheriff , this is a murder ! - No , not a murder ... - A human hand , not a murder ? ! Listen , please ... you 've just got to trust me . If it 's what I think it is , it could be very important for me , please ! No , no , just take me away from here ! Put your hands up or I 'll shoot ! Mrs. Hotchkiss , it 's only me ... Paul , what are you doing here ? You said you wouldn 't be home until late . Well I just remembered this old pile of papers ... So I thought I 'd come back and look something up . Well , what 'd you come in the back door for ? You know how jumpy I am about noises in the house ! I got mr . Hotchkiss' old gun out ... I thought they 'd carry a burglar outta here tonight . I 'm sorry , I guess I just didn 't think . Well , it 's a good thing I did ... I was gonna shoot and ask questions later . This thing 's got a hair trigger , too . Well ... as long as it 's you , it 's ok . How ' bout some supper ? No thanks , I ... I have some stew leftover from last night . I could heat it up for ya . No , I found what I was looking for ... I 'm not hungry , really . I guess I 'll just go up to my room , if you don 't mind . - Good night . - Good night . Yeah , Steve ... it 's positive . There is a reading . I said there was a positive reading . This may be all the evidence we need to convince Barrenger . Oh , really ? Well , snap out of it , would you , Steve ? Don 't you understand I 'm giving you the ammun ... It 's too late , doc ! - What 's that ? - It 's my resignation . You talked to him . No , not quite , he talked . He said either get on his wagon or get out . Well , I 'm getting out . Well now , wait a minute . Tear it up , you don 't need it ! This is the gauge I 've been telling you about . It measures the results of cosmic rays . Or the presence of something associated ... What is the " something , " doc ? ! Well , I ... I don 't know but I did make a very important discovery about Elmer , here . Has he got it ? ! - Very definite ... - Though , how did he get it ? I see ... you 're not aware of ... Elmer . He 's a very distinguished rat ! He was a passenger on our last space probe ... Before we launched our first manned rocket . In the beginning we thought he was completely unaffected . But he wasn 't ? By no means , you see , he 's in that cage alone because I can 't trust him ... I don 't know when he 'll turn on the other rats and kill ' em . Now , he can unlock an ordinary cage , that 's why I had that padlock put on there . Everyone else around here seems to think that ... What he does is in the range of ... An exceptional rat 's capabilities . But I don 't , I think ... Elmer has thoughts . - Are they human ? - Not necessarily . Like this " something ... " The same " something " that was in our pilots . Well , Steve , there 's a possibility ! Jackson ... Have you been makin this noise out here ? Come on , get down . You know better than that ! What is this doing out here ? What a mess ! That boy ! Said he wasn 't hungry and then he comes downstairs ... And knocks these jars off to this shelf ! The last time he 'll get around here in my jelly , I 'll tell you that ! Cleaning after this kid . God ! That boy ! Wait till I get a hold of him tomorrow . Why the shower curtain ? Child waking ' me up in the middle of the night ... I have had enough of it ! Empty . That oughta do it . Mrs. Hotchkiss ! Mrs. Hotchkiss ! Operator ... give me the sheriff , quick ! Sheriff Townsend . Who ? ! Paul ? Paul Lawrence ? Will you stop talking so fast ? I can 't understand a word you 're saying . And stop shouting ! Yes ? Mrs. Hotchkiss ? Now , don 't touch anything . I 'll be there in 5 minutes . Now look , Paul ... I know how you feel , son . But I 'll get there as fast as I can . Lawrence boy says she 's been murdered . Try and raise the county coroner , Earl . And call my wife . Tell her I 'm liable to be up all night . We 'll have to make prints of the place . Sure thing , Ted . Operator , I 'd like to make a long distance call , please . Never mind , operator . - Sheriff ... - Paul , where is she ? In her bedroom . I ... I heard a shot . I ran down from my room , I found her like this . No signs of a bullet . Did you hear anything else , like a door closing or somebody running ? No ... No , nothing . Looks like she 's been strangled . You can see the marks on her throat ... no doubt about it . Now , tell me boy ... did you ever see this gun before ? It belongs to mr . Hotchkiss ... She told me that ... it had a hair trigger . Yes , it probably fired when it fell off the table . Now I know this is hard on you boy , but ... Anything you can remember will help . Anything at all . Now , do you recall ... did she leave any valuables around the house ? Any sizable amounts of money ? N-n ... she never mentioned it to me . Not that I know . Well , that isn 't the way rumor has it . That is if you can believe my wife , Edith . And you can 't always do that . That 'll probably be Earl . I 'll get the door . That should do the trick . At least that 's what my wife Edith says ... usually does for her . 2 of those and a glass of warm milk and she 's out like a light . We 'll go over the routine questions in the morning . Now Paul , just one other thing ... Maybe you don 't wanna stay here in the house . I could drive you over to my house and we 'll find you another place tomorrow . No ... no , I 'll be alright . Don 't worry about it . Soap and water 'll take that ink off . You better go upstairs and try and get some sleep . All through downstairs , Ben ... Think you got anything ? Well , most of the prints were pretty small ... They seem to match the ones we got off the gun and the flashlight . A ... woman 's prints ? Yeah , I think so but I can 't tell yet ... There was one that might be interesting ... Got it off a medallion she was wearing . How soon can we get a report ? Well , I 'll tele-photo a set of these to Washington ... And run a make on ' em here , we oughta know something in ... 5 or 6 hours . What about the kid ? Earl , I don 't know . I don 't like to guess on a case like this . I just don 't understand why he wants to stay in the house . I should think he 'd want to get as far away from here as possible ! He 's a medical student , he 's used to being around dead bodies . Yeah , I suppose . Now come on ... we got a full night 's work ahead of us . - Let 's go . - Yeah , mayb ... maybe if we 're lucky ... We 'll get an hours sleep , huh ? Space medicine ... Dr. Weitzberg ... Weitzberg , Weitzb ... Operator , long distance please . I 'd like to call ... A doctor Max Weitzberg . In Washington D.C .. No , no operator , I don 't have the number . Listen , operator ... this is an emergency . No , no , I 'll hold on , ok ? No , uh ... Weitzberg . W ... E ... I , T , Z ... B ... E ... R ... G. No ... G. B , E ... R ... G. Thank you . Ring him for me . Boy , I sure could use a beer . Who couldn 't ? But we can 't stop now . But there 's some in the kitchen . Not me , not here . Not even for a nice , cool beer ? Listen , whoever got her is probably hundreds of miles away , by now . Just think of that long , tall , foamy brew . You could talk a snake out of its skin . Ok , let 's take a look . With my luck , she won 't even have any . Dames likes her always keep beer around . I told you there 'd be beer in the refrigerator . Holy ... ! Come here ! What 's the matter ? What is it ? I don 't know but I 'm gettin ' outta here ! Wait a minute , he might still be alive . With a face like that and those marks on his throat ? Listen , buddy , we were supposed to collect the dame and that 's all . This guy 's on his own ! He is alive , let 's get him outta here . Get the other stretcher , hurry up ! - Morning , Donna . - 9 o 'clock , right on time . Did you get any sleep ? A little , not as much as I shoulda . How do you do when you slip apartment ? I 'm alright , Steve . Really . There 's ... this thing 's gonna be a bug . This race from the space ... You know how I feel about Lockhart , how we all feel . But it 's more than just his loss , could be the loss of the whole human race . - Doc and I are ? - I understand , Steve . What about Barrenger ? Well , ? No ... Well , he will . Donna ... did you figure out a good excuse for me to get out of the office ? I don 't wanna see him just now . I 'll do better than that ... A mr . Meidel from Security called ... Wants you to see him as soon as possible . It sounded in a very polite way like an order . Well , I wonder what he wants ... I have no idea . Well , anyway it 's a good excuse for to get out of here , isn 't it ? I 'll tell you what ... I 'm going down to pick up Doc ... Gonna meet the crime committee and see what it takes us to blame . Goodbye . This print is quite distinctive . Notice the scar running directly through the loop ... Makes them impossible to mistake . Now , the one on the left was tele-photoed last night ... From the sheriff 's office at Palms , a small town in California . So ? We just thought you 'd be interested in the fact ... That this print belongs to a man connected with your department . Who ? An astronaut ... by the name of Lockhart . That 's very interesting , Mr. Meidel ... Would you tell me what Lockhart was doing , in California ? He 's suspected of murdering a Mrs. Hotchkiss . Now , Mr. Curan ... would you care to tell us where we can find Lockhart ? Well , to be perfectly honest with you , Mr. Meidel ... I haven 't seen Lockhart in over a week . But if I do get some information I 'll be sure to pass it on to you . I see ... Well , we 'll leave it at that , for the moment . Now , I don 't have to warn you that this is a police matter . And beholding information could be serious . Even for a person of your position . Well , I 'm very much aware of that , Mr. Meidel ... And I don 't wanna get mixed up in your department along with my troubles , thank you . Meidel ? Ok , I 'll be right there . If you excuse me , gentlemen ... I 'm gonna have to leave you . Well , we can find the way out , thank you . Well doc , would you mind telling me what that was all about ? I can 't . I think we should stop it and see Barrenger . I always thought that fingerprints didn 't lie . Now we know Lockhart wasn 't in California . We don 't know anything of that kind , Steve . I got a call this morning at 4 o 'clock from Palms , California . There was no one on the line . Of course I don 't believe it , who could ? ! And don 't think I 'm gonna let some fantastic story about a ghost ... Fingerprints or no fingerprints , Stop me from carrying out this project ! - Now , wait a minute , Lee ... - I 'm not waiting for anything ! Look , when I took this job ... I was given a goal and a time limit . And the time limit has just about run out . Lee , I think we 're forgetting the facts of the situation . I know it may all sound rather trivial , with all of your problems here ... But the fact of the matter remains that a murder has been committed . And the prime suspect in this case happens to be one of our men ! That 's right , Lee . I gathered from the attitude of Mr. Meidel of Security ... That it won 't be long before he applied real pressure , right here . We may find ourselves right in the middle of an investigation . However , you do have an alternative , Lee . When Meidel calls you can gain time by simply stating that ... Lockhart had no authorization to be in California . And at the present time , you haven 't the slightest idea of where he is . An absolutely true statement . One , which you can 't possibly be criticized for . Steve and I can fly to Palms and investigate this ... " ghost story . " May hold up the project a couple of days ... Practically nothing to lose . Well , what do you say , Lee ? Alright , you win . Go on , take off . Barrenger speaking . Yes , Mr. Meidel . Paul ? Sheriff ! You alright ? Sure . Where have you been ? I ... just took a walk . I ... woke up , I ... I guess this thing bothered me a little more than I thought . I ... I just took a walk . But you 're filthy , dirty . You 're all sweaty . You must 'a walked awfully hard . Now , look , Paul , I 'm here because an ambulance driver called me . He told me a strange kind of a story . Have you got anything to tell me ? No , sir . Alright , I 'll tell you what I want you to do . I want you to stick close to the house . I wouldn 't go out at all , if I were you . I don 't care what you do , but stick close to the house . You understand ? Why don 't you just go ahead and arrest me ... - And get it over with ? ! - There 's no charge against ya , boy ! Not yet . I suggest you go up and get some sleep . You had a hard night . Yes sir . I 'm telling this ... really ... for you ... Professor Farnstrom ... and Marta . I know you will both realize ... that it is the truth . That I am not out of my mind . You were right , professor . I ... shouldn 't ... keep things to myself . I ... I ... I tried to be a lone wolf and ... I guess ... I wanted all the credit for myself . Marta and I were swimming ... And up on the sand ... we found something quite ... interesting . It was an arm ... just an arm . Had a ... strange ... covering . I ... guess ... Probably must 've been ... From ... A ... space suit ! When 'd this thing arrive , Earl ? - Why , what is it ? - It 's from Washington . We asked for a confirmation on those fingerprints at the Hotchkiss house . Well , they say they belong to a guy I never heard of , Lockhart ! - Who ? ! - Melvin Lockhart . Do you know a Melvin Lockhart ? Anybody in this town by that name ? Never heard of one . It isn 't the half of it . - They 're movin ' in . - Who 's movin ' in ? Washington ! Great Caesar 's ghost ! Can you tell me why they want in on a case like this ? A widow lady get 's herself killed ... A prime suspect ... The only possible suspect I 've got right here in my hands . I was gonna make an arrest within a couple hours ! - Kid ? - Most certainly the kid . - Thank you . - You know the way he 's been acting ! The only one that could possibly have done it . Now they come up with a man named Lockhart . And they 're taking over . Earl , I 'll tell ya what 's happened . They 've got so many fingerprints in Washington they 've got ' em all mixed up ! Well , what 's the use ? We can 't buck ' em , not yet . They also wanna have us put a guard on the house . " Nobody gets in . " Want me to go over and sit on the place ? Yeah , you better . And while you 're there ... keep an eye on young Lawrence . I s 'pose I shoulda picked him up long before this , but I ... Just didn 't want him to have a record until I was 100 % sure . And then after those Washington boys get through fooling around ... I 'm afraid he 's still gonna be it . Now , I 'd bet $ 100 on it ! Ok , I 'll get right over there . Right . - Yes , what can I do for you ? - Afternoon , sheriff , I 'm Steve Curan . This is doc Weitzberg and we 're from Washington D.C .. Well , boy ! You government boys really work fast ! You got here in a hurry , let me get you some coffee . - Well , thank you , no ... - No , thanks . Say , tell me ... who 's this man , Lockhart ? Wait a minute , let 's not get started off on the wrong foot here , sheriff . Yeah , I know . You ask the questions , I don 't . Well , you boys are from the Bureau , aren 't you ? Well , that 's just it , sheriff . We 're from ... Space Operations . Spa ... Space Operations ? ! Now , wait a minute , boys . This is Palms , California . Population : 2.306 . A woman gets knocked off and ... We know all about that , sheriff . We just want to ask you a few questions , is all . About this very man , Lockhart . Has he been seen ? Well , I don 't know who you boys are or why you 're here . As far as I 'm concerned , you 've got no authority at all to ask me questions ... Now , wait a minute , we didn 't come out here to get pushed around , sheriff . Now Steve , just a minute ... sheriff ? As a matter of fact , all we want is your permission to go through the house . Nobody goes through the house . Not till the boys from the Bureau get here . And I 've got an armed guard that says nobody does . - We just talked to the sheriff ... - Yeah , he called me . Didn 't change his mind , did he ? Nope ! Well , uh ... do you mind if we just look around outside ? Nothin ' to see , but help yourself . Do you have any theories ? Yeah , somebody killer her . That 's my theory . Well , Steve , I guess we might as well be own our way . Doc , you notice they don 't build houses like this , anymore . Go to rear No , they ... they sure don 't , do they ? Well , we 'll see you around . - See you later . - Yeah . Whatever we gotta get done , we better get done fast . That cold fish gonna be around here any second . Could you distinguish whether it was a man or a woman ? Well , it was a pretty quick glance doc , I 'm not sure . Look , Steve . " Come back tonight after dark . The back door will be unlocked . " " I have something important to tell you . " " Be careful of the deputy . " No signature . Well , I didn 't have a date tonight , did you ? Well , it looks like we both have now , doesn 't it ? Hey ! Paul ? Paul , are you here ? Paul ! What are you doing here ? Get out . Paul , are you alright ? I read in the paper about poor Mrs. Hotchkiss . - Such a terrible thing ! - Never mind . Get out of here . Paul ... ? That thing on the beach ... Just can 't get it out of my mind . - Have you told anyone about it ? - No . Get out ! Why are you staying here ? It 's no good ! You can come to our house ! Marta , please ! Marta , what are you doin ' here ? ! Harrison , get her out of this house . Just get her out ! You just get back to your room . There 's no one allowed in here , Marta , you 'll have to leave . Now wait a minute ... I 've a right to see Paul ! I 'm a friend of his ! Get her out of this house ! Come on , Marta , out . Come on ! And don 't let her come back ! Mortuary Hope I didn 't know she had any relatives back East at all ! I know she used to speak of an uncle , but he was in England or some place . Where 'd you say you were from , again ? - Pennsylvania . - New York . - He 's from New York . - And he 's from Pennsylvania ... We heard about the tragedy and flew out here . I see ... well , uh ... here she is . You can take a look , if you like . Really looks very well ... Of course , we got the body quite soon after the , uh ... crime . And there weren 't any , uh , marks ... except the ones on her throat . You know , sometimes , in cases like this ... Yes , we ... we know . Looks , uh ... very well , I think . Yes , Steve . Yes ! What 's he doing ? What is that thing ? That wards off evil spirits . I see . There 's absolutely no doubt . Ah ... thanks very much . We 're satisfied . And you 're absolutely right , she looks very well . Hello ? Anybody here ? - Looks like we 're alone . - Yeah ... Wonder where our little friend is ? I think he was watching alright ... he 'll be down any minute , don 't worry . If we could only turn on a light ! We do and that deputy 'd be here in a second . Yeah , that 's right . I gotta keep this flashlight away from the windows , too . - Steve ! - What ? Give me the light . Put it on the gauge . - Yeah ... - What do you see ? Well there 's an indication , it 's ... it 's faint , but it 's ... definite . Yeah , so I see ... Steve ! Keep it over here . Yeah ... Well , what 's it read ? - This is very strange ! - What 's that ? Well , there 's a very strong reading right here on top of the shelf ... Nothing above , or below . Well now , that 's ridiculous , doc . No man could get up on that shelf , it would never hold him ! Doesn 't have to be a man ... Lockhart 's fingerprints ... remember ? Yeah ... Well , perhaps we can trace the trail back to where it came from . - Keep the light on the gauge . - Alright . Yes ... look ! Stronger . Look , Steve ! It 's right up the wall . Steve ... It 's on the ceiling ! Doc ... what man do you happen to know that walks on the ceiling ? Turn off the light ! Alright , let him move first . Hello ? Come on , say something ! Put the light on him . Alright ! Back into the house ... Come on ! Back up . No ... What are you two doin ' back here ? Well , don 't bother about us , go after that maniac ! Well now , you must 've seen him , he rain right past you ! I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . Into the house , I 'll call the sheriff . Look officer , you 're wasting time . Go after that man ! Shut up and get back into the house ! - But I ... - Alright , doc ... Nothing we can do about it right now ... I know I 'll never remember this stuff ! Ibsen , O 'Niell ... If I just get a D , I 'll be happy ! Do you understand it , Marta ? What 's the matter , pal ? You collapsed ? Hey ... kid ! That exam 's tomorrow and you 've got to pass . You know they expect twice as much from foreign students . It wasn 't the sleep ... It 's just that ... I know , you 're concerned about Paul . But he 'll be ok . Patsy ... ! I just don 't understand it , what 's happened to him ? It 's just terrible ! He screamed at me ... why is he staying in that house ? Gee , I don 't know ... Pop hasn 't said a word about it at home ... Well , there 's no use me asking him ... He just won 't tell me anything about stuff like that . They 're keeping him a prisoner ! Well , he ... may be a suspect . Paul didn 't kill anyone . That , I 'm sure of . Pop always says you can 't be sure what anyone is going to do ... In certain circumstances . He didn 't kill anyone ... I 'm sure of that ! I thought it 's perhaps time for a little rest and refreshment . You know studying at such a furious pace without pause can be very exhausting . I 'm afraid that 's not the case . - At least not for me ... - No ? Any case , there are sandwiches and coke ... And I 've made quite a tempting , little snack . You 've sold me , professor . Lead the way . And you , Marta ? Forgive me , grandpa ... I 'm really not hungry . I haven 't been studying and I better start , I 'm afraid , if I don 't want to flunk tomorrow . Well ... as you wish . Patsy and I will have to eat extra portions , then . And I 'm just the girl who can do it , too . Be back in a few minutes , pal . Paul ! Could I talk to you for a minute ? Yes , of course . Come inside . Paul , I 've been so worried ! I know ... Listen . I 'm going away . Away ? When ? ! Now . Just as soon as I get rid of something that ... Must be destroyed . I just could go without saying goodbye , first . Paul ... what 's the matter ? What are you afraid of ? Tell me ! I can 't ! Just one thing I wanna tell you ... I didn 't kill Mrs. Hotchkiss . I know that , Paul . You couldn 't have ! But there are people who think I did . Sheriff Townsend ... What 's the difference ? If you didn 't , everything will be alright . Grandfather will help you . He loves you very much , Paul . Don 't touch me . Listen ... I ... I can 't explain it , but ... I ... I 'm all mixed up . And then , and there 's something terrible that 's happened to me ... and I ... I ... I ... and I ... There 's only one person that I could have relied on in this world , and ... I almost killed him a few minutes ago ! What do you mean ? Never mind , it would take too long to explain ... I don 't have the time , I ... There are times when I 'm alright , and then I 'm not , and then I 'm ... And then when I 'm myself and I 'm not . And the periods when I 'm myself I ... Are getting shorter , and shorter , to wh ... - Do you understand ? ! - No ... Well , then don 't try ! I gotta get outta here . Leave me alone . No , Paul . I 'm not going to let you go . If you 're ill , we 'll help you . You can come and stay with us . And we 'll take care of you until you 're well . Listen , Paul ... Do you remember when you asked me that question ? Whether I was going back home after summer was over ? I was only teasing you ! I never meant to go ! I want to stay here . I want to be here with you ! - I love you , Paul ! - Oh , no , Marta ... you don 't understand . I won 't ... I won 't let you run away ! No ... no ! No , get away from me ! Paul ? Paul , what 's the matter with you ? What is it ? What 's the matter with you ? ! Marta ? Sheriff , we 're sorry . We shoulda listened to you . We had no idea the boy was so dangerous . You 2 should 've thought of that when you helped him escape . I 'm booking ' both of ya . Be reasonable , now . Look , if he does any harm to that Farnstrom girl I 'll show you how unreasonable I can be ! Earl , take the shortcut down Payne Avenue . My daughter 's at the Farnstrom place , too . Paul ... Paul 's face ... It was white . It was horrible ! There was an arm ... lying in the sand . May I speak with her , professor ? For a moment . Marta ... it was Paul Lawrence , wasn 't it ? Paul ... ? Paul ? Not ... not really Paul . It was in the sand . It was an arm . Lying in the sand ... A human arm . It was Paul Lawrence , wasn 't it ? Hey , his car 's gone ! It was parked right there at the curb . Put a call out on the car ... I 'll make a double-check inside . Unit 1 to Control ... Paul ? 39-A , code 7 ... Spotted him heading down the county dump road but he gave ' em the slip . Well you stick close to the house , just in case . We 'll check with you later . 39-A , clear . What 's this ? Metallic cloth , it looks like . I 've never seen anything like that . It 's the material used for outer space travel . Lockhart 's . I could bet my life . I 'll circle around this way . There he is . Wait a minute , you 're not gonna gun him down , are ya ? He 's a killer . If he doesn 't come quietly , I 'll have to shoot him . But he 's just a kid ! Sure , he 's just a kid ! I know all about kids like him . The county jail 's full of ' em ! Paul ! Paul , don 't do anything foolish ! That 's right , Paul ... I don 't wanna hurt ya . Now put that bottle down and come over here quietly . Come on now , boy ... I wouldn 't wanna use this gun ! Now , put the bottle down so we can get back into town ! Paul ... listen to me ! You didn 't hurt her . Marta is alright . Paul ... come on , now . Are you gonna put that bottle down or am I gonna have to take it away from ya ? We better get him to a hospital right away ! Come on . Doc ! Doc , come over here ! Fingerprints don 't lie . 34 , clear . Ok you two , let 's go ! Not a trace . Not a solitary trace . What have I got , doc ? Nerves , my boy . Just hypertension , now . What you had is an entirely different matter . We 'll talk about it when you get well . What I had ? What happened to it ? Let 's just say that life can exist under different temperatures and ... A fever of 104 was enough to finish it off . Fortunately for you ... and for us . I just talked to Barrenger , he wants to see it immediately . Good . I 'm glad he does . The sooner we get rid of it , the better . Marta ! Come on in . Is he alright ? For a little while , I think it 'll do him more good than harm . Excuse me . Are you sure you got that thing fixed so it won 't ever get away again ? Don 't worry about it , sheriff , it 's in a metal box and it 's locked . And in about 2 minutes it 's gonna be on an airplane and no one will ever see it again . Well , that 'll be alright with me . - Goodbye . - Sheriff . Come on , tell me . Did you mean what you said last night about staying here ? Now , don 't play games . I 'm too weak . How can I help myself ? You know women can 't resist weak men . Then you 're gonna stay ? Just you wait . Just wait till I get out of this bed . Just you ... Wonder what all of the secrecy 's about this time ? There ya go , sticking ' your nose into somethin ' that 's none of your business . All we 're supposed to do is deliver it to the airport . Yeah , but those people inside got me curious . You know that fella from Washington , the way he kept looking at it ... Asking me if I was sure it was locked ? I 'd give anything to take a look inside . Not me , I don 't care what 's in it . Come on , let 's get movin ' . That 's your trouble , no curiosity . You 'll never get any place without curiosity . - You gotta find out about things . - Yeah ? Well , I like it that way . What harm will it do to take a look ? I 've got the key . It might be dangerous . What do you think , it 's alive ? ! You don 't see any holes in the box . You think it 'll bite you , or something ? You 're always talkin ' me into doin ' somethin ' I don 't wanna do . Have I ever steered you wrong ? The end

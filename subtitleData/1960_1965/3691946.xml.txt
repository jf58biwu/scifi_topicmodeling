 Miss . Look . Pull ! He 's a stiff as a plank . Have you got a stretcher ? Carry him like this ? - Commissioner , his documents . - Oh , finally . Angelo Trabucco born March 15 , 1929 in Ivrea . He 's a worker for the SMS . Find his family , someone who might recognise him . And hurry . Commissioner , I 've finished . - What 's happening ? - He was alone . Take away the corpse ! I 've never seen anything like it . - Was it natural causes ? - It doesn 't seem likely . There 's something mighty strange about his death . What , for example ? The rigidity . It has nothing in common with normal rigor mortis . It 's something horribly more intense .. .. As if he had been injected with cement . Yes , It 's him . Poor Mr. Angelo ! He was the best tenant I ever had . My husband worked for the SMS . He was a foreman . And now I 've just my pension . It 's not easy . The group working with Trabucco was one of the most troublesome . These days we monitor them in a special way . - Where do you hide the camera ? - Wherever we can . Here 's some illegal propaganda we discovered . Someone slips the leaflets into the half finished items . - When there will be a strike ? - In 10 days , if there is one of course . - Which is Trabucco ? - In a moment . We keep an eye of the most dangerous .. Lupo , for example , their leader . We keep him isolated .. .. And Torchio , Trabucco 's neighbor . - What happening here ? - The calandrone gyroscope . - Where 's Trabucco ? - Here , passing in front . Is that all there is ? We were mainly concerned with Torchio . I 'm just wasting my time here . That 's enough . - D 'you want to question his foreman ? He was nothing special . Neither good nor bad . He did his work , was on his own ... Towards the end perhaps , a bit more sulky than usual . Didn 't say much . Not even to his friend .. .. the dinner lady . Yes , we were sort of friends , but not like Mr Midollo said . He only sees bad ... .. and not the good in everything . We only met at mealtimes Never outside . Had you noticed anything strange about him recently ? A few days ago he said something strange , now you mention it . That one day we won 't be ourselves , but others .. .. Who will be inside us . That was all , then he looked at me strangely . He was standing just there , where you are now . Like he was scared . - Did you know him ? - No . The foreman had a photograph of Marquis Didier , founder of the SMS . Like my husband , poor thing . A great Italian . Was Trabucco different before he died ? Did he say anything odd ? You know how he was . Always so quiet . - Could I see his room ? - Of course . On second thoughts , perhaps he had changed . - Please . - Thank you . He drank lots of coffee , Always kept the light on . I thought he must be reading . And one night I got up .. .. because his light was on .. Mr. Angelo ? Mr. Angelo , what 's wrong ? Can 't you sleep ? - It 's 3 o 'clock . Go to bed . - Alright . But he stayed awake all night . Could perhaps .. .. he be afraid that someone would surprise him in his sleep ? What d 'you mean sir ? And who would come here ? He didn 't know anyone . Not a soul . - Who 's the magistrate ? - It 's Rosa . We 're all set . But it had to happen to me . What a mess . - Judge . - You 'd forgotten there 's a magistrate . - Not at all . - These northern customs . Here 's a worker who knows no one , has no enemies .. .. Who spends his nights awake , speaking of ghostly beings .. And it 's taken two days to determine this ? And to wash his clothes . He was so rigid , we had to cut them off him . - Weight ? - 85 . - Why talk of rigidity . That 's normal . You haven 't seen the corpse yet . You can 't realise . - Wait a minute , doctor . - I 've 3 more autopsies to do . Now look Judge ? What do you think ? - Natural causes . Nothing exceptional . - Look ! There ! Does that seem normal ? Abnormal , I think . - No . A natural death and nothing else . - I must disagree . - We 'll see . - 185 . - Rigidity . - Commissioner , lets not argue . We 're here find the truth . That 's our job . Again . Rigor mortis is particularly pronounced . - Scalpel . - Fetch the instruments . Look , doctor , look at this ? - Yes . Judge , an acupuncture mark . - What ? - Can you see ? It 's pretty clear . But couldn 't it be an insect bite ? No . It could be a burn I suppose .. .. But it 's more likely a puncture . - Are there any other signs ? - Let 's examine the whole corpse . - Let 's see what there is . - Nothing on the chest . Nothing on the groin ... Don 't worry , it 's nothing . - You 're always under foot ! - What is it , Your Honor ? Don 't just stand there , Doctor ? Do something . Calm down . We must look at this calmly . - How can you be calm ? - It 's an exceptional case .. No sir , it 's just a normal case of catalepsy . - Hardly normal , but I am calm . - Who wants to stay calm ? Thank God we have just killed him . He 's alive .. .. Who luckily for us awoke in time . - Does it hurt ? - Can I help ? Leave me alone , just do your job ! Don 't get excited . Just relax . You have to do these things calmly . It 's an exceptional case . What ? Space Explorer ... Omicron .. Calling the Ministry of Amalgamation of Planet Ultra . Continuing efforts to run the creature I paralyzed .. .. and in whom I am embedded . but I 'm going blind , and don 't understand anything . The Minister replys to Explorer Omicron . - Are there other difficulties ? - It 's an outdated model . I 've not seen anything like it on other planets . It still has muscular and nervous systems .. Damn , we 've discovered a prehistoric species . Doctor , watch out . He 's already walloped me . Don 't be silly , If it hurt 's , rub it . I don 't want any of this getting out . We 'll be made a laughing stock ! - Doctor , can you hear anything ? - Nothing . - An organ of visual perception . - Continue . It 's my last mission of 8,000 inspected planets . - You are the vanguard . - Shh . Someone 's coming . Doctor , he opened his eye . Judge , come and see . Another creature . They look like galactic ants . Study them . You must work them like they do themselves . - Are you sure you 're in control ? - Yes . - This really is most perplexing , - I can 't understand it . Let 's see if he breathes on the mirror . - What do you think ? - What can I think ? He opened the other eye ... He 's not breathing ... He 's alive . Another organ of perception . That 's better . I might be home , tonight . - Not so fast . - Quiet . They can hear you . Impossible ! He 's not breathing , yet he 's opened his eyes . - Doctor , d 'you need any help ? - Leave me alone . I don 't understand their language . First you must wake up your centres of intelligence . - Will it be easy ? - I know you want to go home , Omicron .. .. but there 's only this planet left to conquer . Be as diligent here as you were for the other planetary invasions . How disgusting ! The creatures use the atmosphere . - Damn it ! - It 's amazing ! Please , get back . Give him some more room ! Enough now , enough ! Gentlemen , please . That 's ' enough now . Miss , close the curtain . You can 't submit Trabucco to this kind of confusion . We 've got our job to do too . I 've got an interview to record . Just a moment . I have here the head of the city 's main hospital .. .. who 'll give us the latest findings .. .. on what must be the most singular resurrection of all time . Trabucco is rapidly regaining use of his limbs . His movements are curiously mechanical , very interesting . It 's as if he were discovering movement .. .. and experimenting for the very first time . Improving bit by bit , until there 's a good mechanization . How , Professor , does he rediscover this movement ? By observing and imitating what he sees . - Can he talk yet ? - Not yet , but don 't despair . There are significant problems in feeding Trabucco . He has no desire for nutrition and rejects all food . So we have to feed him intravenously . Another phenomenon is that of crying . It occurs suddenly , without warning . With above normal intensity . For periods of time more or less continuously . But perhaps the most serious problem at the moment .. .. is his constant insomnia , which has continued since his revival . Quiet . One more . Come on ! Bravo . Smile . That 's it . I 'll sell it to Life ! Good . Good ... Bravo ! Good . Wait , huh ? Wait ... Come on ! Bravo ! If we can 't get him to sleep .. The situation will deteriorate .. Hush ! Hush ! Shut up , it 's rude ! With extreme consequences . What 's happening ? - What 's going on here ? - Sounds like a raspberry to me . Things of another world . Tomfoolery ! Go away ! - You can 't continue ! - Our viewers must know . I 'm losing juice . How 's our patient ? Still awake ? He 's crying again . But why all this crisis of melancholy ? Up ! Why don 't we take our first nice little walk . And see if we can do our own wee wee . The doctor will be so happy . - Wait . - That 's it . Come on . Oh God . Hold him ! Like this .. Bravo ! Bravo ! - Who 's that ? - Doctor , quick ! Ah ! Look ! - Quick , pick up the guinea pigs ! Look , there ! There he is ! Look , he 's chasing the rabbit . We must stop him copying the rabbit . If he adapts to them it could be dangerous . Explorer Omicron calling Ultra . My discovery of how they feed is confirmed . They make their own liquid food . I 'm having breakfast with them now . Did you know my poor husband ? Have this hanky . Planet Ultra replys to Omicron . We have serious doubts about this and your other discoveries . I think you 're distancing yourself , to bring forward to your return . You know our way to conquer the other planets .. .. Embody ourselves in their population . You were paid to do this experiment first . If you give us false information it could ruin everything . - We don 't know if these creatures rest . - No , they don 't rest . Impossible . All prehistoric creatures rested .. .. Otherwise they soon died out . You should have studied this . - I didn 't think . - Unconsciousness . Try it ! Over and out . Quiet . Ssh .. He 's sleeping . The doctor will be happy when he hears about this . Take him back . How 's our Trabucco ? Dr. Peluso of SMS here to sign off their employee . Miss Mari . - Poor thing . - Don 't worry , he can 't understand . We were able to restore everything except speech and intelligence . At the provincial asylum , Cogoleto . - Are you ready to sign now ? - Cigarette ? - No thanks . - Thanks . - Oh , I forgot . - No , look . Look at how we smoke . Here . What 's happening ? - What do we do ? - No . Why did you let him smoke ? You know what his reactions are . - He 's done this before ? - Not this , but other things . It 's a form of imitative madness .. .. Which exceed all human reactions . .. It 's all written down here . Sign here and afterwards we 'll take him . - One moment . - Alright . Oh God ! Enough ! Re-employ him . Another press ! Get another press and bring it here immediately . - We must maintain the average . - Yes . OK . Come with me . Carry on timekeeper . You , Torchio , go down there . Sit here . - Hey , what will you do ? - Wait and find out . Don 't even think of cutting times because of that madman . - What 's the average ? - 60 per minute . Come on . Next . Finished . Why haven 't the other parts arrived ? - Hey , are you asleep ? I can 't . You can 't make me . 60 a minute , it 's crazy ! - I 'll never manage it ! - If he can , everyone can . No more 10 pieces per minute ! Understand ! From now on things must change ! I 'll give you something to moan about . - Alfani . - Excuse me . - Curious , eh ? You realize , President , why I have re-hired the worker Trabucco ? Amazing . - Psychologist . Prini . - Let 's watch it in slow motion . - Slower . - Slow it down ! - But I said slower ? - Slow it down . - Slower . - I can 't slow it down any more . What are your conclusions , Professor ? This man is totally inhibited in intelligence and will .. .. And at the same time incredibly developed .. .. with above average mechanical abilities . According to me it 's fundamentally a question of discipline . His catalepsy has resulted in a cancellation of some faculties .. .. And an abnormal development of certain others . It 's turned him into something impossible , an efficient worker . A model employee . Now I wonder , if we could isolate ... .. analyze and reproduce his psychological condition ... .. Of course , for scientific purposes only . - And cause general catalepsy ? - That 's not what I meant . - Enough ! Light . - Wouldn 't it be better to try it in a lunatic asylum ? There you go , take it . Well done . Mr. Trabucco ! I heard you 'd recovered , but didn 't think I 'd see you so soon . When they told me you 'd ... not died , I felt ... Come on ! Enough of these " jeremiads " . Don 't listen to women . They 're all trouble . The usual 500 . You 're lucky , Midollo , this 'll win you the production prize . Not if we get him . He 's not the only forman .. .. We can ask , after all , he belongs to the factory . It 's a trick of the management to destroy the strike . Training them so hard to make us look like slackers . And our protests against the exploited workers look absurd . - What do we do ? - Wait till Trabucco leaves tonight . We can 't . Midollo 's asked to take him home . We must think of something . We must be careful . You saw how the bosses looked at you tonight ? - Good evening , Mr. Midollo . - Well , what d 'you want ? To say I 'm sorry for what I said today . I was tired . The truth is you don 't like work . It 's that simple . That 's not true , you know me . I said to myself .. " You have to work with Mr. Midollo .. .. even if he seems like a bastard , it 's for the good of the team . " But others don 't understand and want to write to the newspapers .. .. Using a disabled guy to get promotion at the expense of the other foremen . It 's that scoundrel Torchio , right ? What a rascal ! - There 's a few of them ? - Who are they , come on ! Tell me who , or you 're a coward . The usual slackers , right ? Some of them are even foremen . What a bunch of stupid jerks ! We allied with other team leaders to " crucify " your leader . They want to ruin me . And you lot just play along . If I get promoted I 'll need a second in command . Tell me the names and that place could be yours . Thanks boss , but I wouldn 't snitch , even if I knew anything . In that case you can keep making calandrone gyroscopes .. .. Forever at 60 a minute . And if you can 't , I 'll make you . You 'll regret not listening to me ! Where 's Trabucco ? Where is he ? Hey you dirty traitor , stop there . What d 'you think you 're doing ? I 'll knock that so-called catalepsy out of you . D 'you want to to ruin us ? Have us starve to death ? Open up ! Leave him alone , cowards ! - Ignore him . Midollo 's a bastard . - The dirty swine . We 're not in the factory now . We can do as we please . No compromise . We must stop him returning to the factory . If we 're recognized , we 're screwed . Let 's hide . You ! You ! You ! Finally , there you are . Come on . - Like iron ! - Can 't you leave him alone ? You said he was half man , half machine . Suffering from imitative insanity .. Wait ! 3,600 calandrone gyros an hour multiplied by 8 hours .. 8 times 0 - 0 . 6 times 8 - 48 . 3 times 8 - 24 . 24 and 4 equal to 28,800 calandrone gyros a day . Instead of making that racket , what about my plans for him ! - Stop thinking of yourself ! - I have my plans too . - I 'll teach you to dance . - What are you doing ? What am I doing ? Go and make his bed ! Don 't worry about him . We 're not married . Relax ... relax ! Don 't tire him . I 've finished . Now it 's time for bed . I 'll just say goodnight . Come on ! - No , not with him ! - Why not with him ? Three hour you were going on about the wonders of his productivity . - Not for this , bitch ! - 3,600 units per hour ? I meant on ... on the conveyor belt . Why now ? You always turned a blind eye in the past . You 've never been jealous before . No , with him , no ! - Not with him , d 'you hear me ? - You 're starting to annoy me . Suppose you wear him out and tomorrow he can 't keep his average ? - What d 'you want to happen ? - Promotion ! They 'll give him to another foreman . Why d 'you always think of yourself ? How did you teach him to make the gyros ? # He wants to dance with me ... # They want to take him away from me too . Help ! Help ! - What 's wrong ? He 's a thug ! Get him out of my house . It was you provoked him . Come on , come on . It 's not my fault . I told you not to listen to women ! She 's a nympho , that one . - Go to bed . - # Please you would dance with me ? # What are you doing ? You don 't understand . Help ! This is getting dangerous ! No , Get off me ! ... Let go ! Pervert . # Please , would dance with me Dance if you dare . # # Thanks , I prefer not ! # Get out of my house ! It 's just not worth it . No matter what the company give me . I won 't have you , but neither will the other foremen either . Die " Samson ... with all the Philistines . " Your Excellency , President of the Confederation of Ultra . Mr. President ! No . .. To the esteemed Minister of Amalgamation of Planet Ultra . Dear Minister , I the undersigned explorer , Omicron .. .. After further loss of juice , and in a last and vain attempt .. .. To understand the language of creatures .. .. Who express themselves with communicative percussion ... .. I seek permission to leave the creature in which I am embodied .. .. by killing it , and returning to base . I could not in any way awaken the intelligence .. .. and request to be replaced by another explorer .. .. more familiar with the prehistoric races . Get out of the way ! I did it ! Perhaps I can . This is the language . Undoubtedly . I can speak , understand . I have awoken intelligence , the word ! Son .. .. of a whore ! I have awoken intelligence ! I can speak with the voice of the creature , using its mind .. .. know where I am , know the damn words ! At Pometo ... day after tomorrow ! Comma ! Cold ! Delivery ! Dish ! Goal ! Phone . I told the police no ! Continue to search the hospitals and clinics ! Let 's hope they haven 't killed him . If we could only find his workmates . I fear they 've done him in and gone into hiding . They seemed determined to , and nearly killed me . I was hit on the head and stunned . You don 't realize the huge scandal about to be born ! If they killed him .. .. Everyone knows we made a sick man work ... .. to increase production . We could all end up in jail for this ridiculous experiment . Telephone . Yes ? Paramedics in Milan .. .. have brought in our injured worker tonight . Get there immediately . Our doctor 's on his way . Not one injured worker but seven . Is that my fault ? Are you saying the call was mistaken ? But where 's Trabucco ? What 've you done with him ? Answer ! Where 's Trabucco ? Cowards , what have you done with him ? Where ? You bastards . Six against one . A fine bunch ! And Torchio , where 's he ? Torchio ! - Where 's Trabucco ? - I wish I knew . Oh , my goodness ! - Mr. Angelo .. - WHO IS IT ? It 's me , Mrs. Piattino . Don 't you recognize me ? How did you find your way home ? - Your clothes are covered in blood . - Shut up ! Shut up ! Sorry , there 's interference from a nosy terrestrial . - Continue - His name is Angelo Trabucco . Now , I identify with him . He produces an object : the calandrone gyro . Goodness knows why I wish you could see this creature . He 's indescribable . He receives images through balls of jelly .. .. And through a single crater makes noises and feeds . - Is it educated ? - Oh , yes , of course . - Make a report . - Ah , a report .. I 'd forgotten it . Absolutely . So , back to the creature . His is a model relatively easy to handle . With just two gripper rods , two mobile pedestals for traction .. And a hood .. The objects surrounding are harmless : .. A pen , the widow 's inkwell , a comb .. Therefore we can deduce the invasion will happen without difficulty . - Over and out . - How , over and out ? - Soon I 'll be back up . - What ? How ? You know how . Killing the creature I 'm wearing . I kill Trabucco and unbundle . Is there another way ? Wait , it 's not possible to kill these creatures . - The Law 's changed , didn 't you know ? - Well , you hear these things .. We agreed , once the mission 's over I go back up ... and now UP ! - Omicron , if you kill this creature , we 'll disintegrate you . We must invade the Earth and you say there are widows made of plastic . - I 'm not educated . - Educate yourself . Read ! If you want to go home , first report on the terrestrials . How they live , what they think , how many , how they reproduce . How they reproduce I can tell you right now . - Actually , you can imagine it . - Why ? They 're prehistoric . They reproduce like our ancestors . - No ! Sticky absorption ? - Sticky absorption ! There must be two . They don 't know about cosmogenetic projection . - Only women give birth . - Women ? - There are still genders ? How many ? - Lots . - Lots ? I see you know many things . Why did you say otherwise ? - It 's not easy . - Never mind , the others will learn . - Meanwhile , make an experiment and describe it to me . - But if you 're proposing absorption ? - Yes and soon . Are you crazy ? It 's unnatural . I 'm not a cosmosexual . You won 't come home if you 're not absorbed , d 'you hear ? OK , I 've got an idea . HELP ! But even here , some are a pain in the backside . It 's a waste of time . No , no , no .. I 'll have to read up on even this . - Good morning , Mr. Midollo . - Huh ? ! Sorry for the delay but last night I had a headache .. I don 't know .. Oh , I 'm just going to do some studying . Be careful . Perhaps he only seems to be cured . - Warn the director . - It 's a miracle he returned alone . I 'll consult the president . Trabucco has been found and has returned to normal . But I did warn the asylum about maybe readmitting him . No , if he 's completely back to normal .. .. it would be complete stupidity to send him back . Leave him be . Forget it . The case is closed . Right ? - Is the person in charge here ? - At a meeting of lubricant retailers . In Lazio , about 7 million tons , 5 in the province of Rome . - We randomly selected these figures - Look at these . For what could be an extensive publicity campaign . If our lubricants beat those of our competitors .. .. credit goes to the professor who devised the slogan of our success . Now show us what he 's come up with .. .. to be the slogan for this year 's campaign . Where is my SMS oil can ? Mother has taken it to make the salad . What clearness ! Let me speak . The representative of Lodi . Silence ! Please ! Do you really think we talk to people in this way ? - I think it 's exaggerated . - We can prove that it isn 't . Out of my way . Here , gentlemen , the demonstration of what we are saying . This omelette has just been cooked with our lubricating oil . - Oh , wonderful ! - If someone ... One moment , please . If someone wants to taste it , it would be a test of confidence in the company . - Yes , let him . - Excuse me , Doctor . - Please . I don 't doubt what you say .. .. but if the first taste should go to the professor .. .. then our confidence in the slogan will be more complete . Why not ? It seems like a good opportunity . I don 't believe it . Are you looking for me ? Yes , I was looking for you . - I need books . - Which books ? I do not know , lots ... all ! Here 's the catalog . Choose the book you want . - Only one ? - Did you think otherwise ? But what can I do with one ! 200 lira . Last minute sale ! 200 lira . Last minute sale ! 200 lira , gentlemen ! Hurry , before we close down ! All human knowledge for 200 lira ! That 's a really explosive way to learn about birds . 200 lira ! Smashing choice . Another genre , of course . 200 lira ! He wants them all , that one . 200 lira that one ! Last minute sale ! What are you doing , sir ? Giving a hand , sir ? Thank you , sir . There are still kind people in this world . If there were more young men like you .. Thank you , sir . Thanks ! Good evening , Mr. Angelo . Why be ashamed of a good deed ? You know , I think I 've just guessed your little secret . - You 're not by chance a scout ? But why keep it hidden . I myself was a ... Girl Guide . A Girl Guide . When I saw you help the old man I understood immediately . - You believe in certain principles . - Of course . A few of us remain loyal to certain values .. .. they taught us . - That 's it . - Thank you , sir . - Thanks ! - Goodbye . What are you doing ? Stop ! My books , my books ! Stop , thief ! 20 : 30 . Study for three hours , then give my report . Then at midnight , I 'll clear off . Risqué . Long ... What an organizer ! Scandal . The French Revolution . The Russian Revolution . The liberal revolution . The revolution ... sexual . They 're always making revolutions . Just wait for us . Son , My son . Here I Am , My Father . Iorio 's Daughter . The Son of the Captain . The Daughter of Colonel . The Sons of Bitches . Well , now the family 's complete . I 've run out of time . Ready ! Explorer Omicron ready to give his report on planet Earth . We 'll the record the brain waves . Will it take long ? No , I made a wonderful discovery ! So we can conquer this planet with a small army . After studying , I 've divided the creatures into two groups . Creatures of 1st choice and creatures of 2nd choice . This is the first choice ... And here is the second . The first are rarer , whilst the second are more numerous . But their value is quite different . A commander of the first is worth more than one thousand of the seconds . The creatures of the first have the power and wealth of the Earth . And if we are smart we 'll only incorporate into them .. .. saving time and men and become the masters of the planet . - We need to eliminate the seconds . - No ! - Those seconds are indispensable . - Why ? Because they buy the products of the first creatures . They 're consumers . Without them the planet would be ruined . This is how industry conquers markets with its products . But if these creatures don 't have any riches .. ... who gives them the money to consume ? The first creatures , but they don 't give it , they lend it . With a system called " Closed Cycle " First they work in their factory .. .. then they lend them the money . Then convince them to buy their products , so restoring their money . But they don 't return it all and therefore sign IOUs . The remaining currency feeds the monetary circulation .. .. consuming other products . These other consumers cause a redistribution of income . So new purchases , new payments .. .. new revenue for the creatures of the first choice .. .. new production , new redistribution , etc . Now you can also follow it yourself . In this original system all the creatures are necessary . But the major benefits are for the creatures of the first choice .. .. who are the ruling class . We need only get inside them to take over the Earth . Above all they are comfortable , well sprung and well fed .. - Look at this . - What 's wrong with this creature ? I stripped her with my imagination .. .. I 'm using the sexual instinct of Angelo so you can see better . See how comfortable . And this one . - These two as well . - Right away . - The man ? - Yes - Both men and women . - If you want . The slave . Everyone . I want to examine them all . Here they all are . Mamma mia , how ugly they all are . The idea of being embodied in one of them is absolutely revolting . But they 're the masters ! Just by possessing them we can control all the others . Without having to change anything of their systems . - Got that ? - Absolutely . So now I can consider my mission complete ? Congratulations Omicron Perhaps the best invasion plan you 've done so far . We 'll be here in 48 hours , to take possession of the directors . - Great , I 'll help with the departure . - You mean arrival on Earth . No , the departure from Ultra . I 'll be there in about another 5 minutes . You 're mad , you can 't kill the creature . I 've already told you . I don 't care about the new law .. .. I 'm preparing a little drinky to say goodbye to Mr. Trabucco . Omicron , you know what the new law says ? The creatures can only be killed in cases of Exceptional Emergency . Angelo will be eliminated two days after the invasion by the Ministry . - And then you can go back to Ultra . - I know the promises of the Ministry . The same thing happened on Mars . I was swindled . But not twice . Sugar . Then I was to decouple after the invasion .. .. and instead I had to wait for the Martian to die a natural death . 216 years inside the same Martian ! But now I don 't care . I 'm going back before the invasion ! Else I 'll be stuck here ! Sugar the rim of the glass . - Shake - Omicron , watch out ! - I repeat for the last time , don 't do this madness . It would be sad for a vanguard explorer to be disintegrated . Dash of insecticide . I 've called the disintegration platoon If they arrive , you 're dead . You 'd have one chance in a thousand . Die a natural death or be killed before the invasion . - That 's in 48 hours ? - Yes , but don 't fool yourself . If you think you can kill yourself and make it look like an accident .. .. we 'd find out in 15 minutes and then you 'd be disintegrated for sure . But if someone hates Angelo so much as to kill him ? - That would be different . - That would be different . Over and out . Let 's see who would hate me enough to kill me ? I killed him because he questioned the honor of my sister .. .. declares Cuneo 's murderer with pride . Where can I find someone with a sister ? A simple joke punished with death . Shot his best friend who jokingly called him cuckold . No , no , no . Wait , Wait ! Girl brutally raped .. .. kills her seducer with 26 stab wounds . It was my prized possession declares the unfortunate .. .. alluding to her lost virtue , and he took it from me . Now my life is over . An empty freight car made a squalid alcove . Yes - Midollo , can I can go rape a girl ? - What ! - Are you crazy ? - Thanks , I won 't be a moment . He 's calling you . Look ! - Go on , it 's alright . - Thanks ! - He 's not bad eh ? - Mr. Angelo , you remembered me ? - Sure , how are you ? Fine , thanks .. - D 'you want to go for a walk ? - I 've no time . Me too , only 15 minutes , just time for an ice cream and a chat . That 'd be nice . You see , Lucy , from what you said last night , I 'd guess .. .. you aren 't a woman of easy virtue . Why d 'you say that ? Had you thought that I was ? I was wondering if you would kill someone .. .. to defend the precious flower of your purity . I don 't know . No one could say for certain . But I think I 'd do anything to keep my purity .. .. and not lose my self respect . To give intact to the man I marry , my only wealth . - Exactly the right answer . - Where are we going ? - Now I 'll explain . - Mr. Angelo , where are you taking me ? But why bring me here ? - I 'm sorry , there 's no time to lose - I don 't understand . Let 's leave . - But what d 'you want ? - Seduce her brutally . - Time 's running out . - You 're crazy , let me go ! - Afterwards you can avenge your honor ! - Get off me ! - Help ! - Pig-headed The brute dragged her into the goods wagon .. .. and on the bare planks despoiled her virtue . But the unfortunate freed herself and with 16 stab wounds found justice . - Look , there he is . - Midollo ! He 's disappeared . Look , there 's the girl . - Four ... Three ... Two ... One ... - Surrender , right this minute . - No ! - Come down or I 'll shoot . - Shoot , what are you waiting for ? D 'you understand ? Come here ! Tell me now , how many men has your slut of a sister had .. .. whilst you 're out on the beat ? Come on , shoot ! Defend your honor like Cuneo 's murderer ! I 've only a brother and he 's a priest ! It 's from the wagon . You go with the girl . I wish I could .. Who shot him ? What have you done ? Answer me ! Just a joke .. What are you doing with that brush ? Stop ! Just look at this ! CUCKOLD What are you doing here ? Get back to work unless you want trouble . Come on you fools , where 's your dignity ? Why didn 't you shoot me ? Didn 't you understand my joke ! I 'm sure that boy can recover .. .. and it would be a shame not to use his powers for the good of the masses . How could he be put to best use ? I think we could use him to stop the scabs , the day after tomorrow . He could stop 100 all by himself , if persuaded . It seems to me that these scabs might even kill me . Mind you , I 'd be proud to die for the cause . Ah yes , a bit dangerous . And if I die the day after tomorrow , it 's no use . Couldn 't we start tomorrow midnight ? A little bit early ? - What , anticipate the strike ? - Why should we listen to him . Don 't you see , he 's the usual provocateur , bribed by the bosses . - And even now he 's following orders . - We 've got no proof . - And if you had ? - I 'd kill him with my own bare hands . - I say tomorrow . - I can 't take any more of this . Stop it , sit down . Now that he 's agreed , to help us tomorrow .. .. why must we wait till the day after ? This evening we could get him to take the posters . And tomorrow he could start making the clandestine propaganda with the others . So he knows all the activists and could tip-off the authorities . He already knows what would happen if he did that . They 'd strangle me with their own hands . Right . Just think . Stop shoving lads . Take it easy or I 'll stop . But we 've got all these to deliver ? We 've got to finish before the trams stop running . Tonight there 's a parade and the traffic will be blocked . Calm down ! calm down ! There 's enough for you all . " Think not that I am come to send peace on earth , but a sword " Holy words . Lenin ? Christ . The Gospel According to Saint Matthew . Onwards , comrade , ever forwards ! The last ones to join are always make the most fuss .. .. to cover their own lack of ideological preparation . I was scared . I 'd no idea he wanted to do such things , that beast Trabucco . But he tried to , even to me . And that 's even worse . I ask you , Mrs Pattino , help me to get him fired . There 's no danger . Just rummage through his room when he 's not there . When you find some subversive material that will be enough for me . - Stealing such material isn 't a crime . - OK , I 'll do it . S.M.S. workers participating in the general strike .. Nicoli ! Petitti ! Ranzani ! Gallea ! Papucci ! Bonino ! Lupo and Trabucco ! But those are the names from my notebook . I 've been robbed . Take any propaganda you find . You see . - Any recently delivered letters , throw them out . - Who 's sent me this letter ? - The head of personnel , why ? - I want a word with him . Sacked without notice ? That 's put a spoke in your wheels . Come on , get a move on . You 're the last one . There 's a mistake , I must speak with him . I 'm proud of you comrade Trabucco . You 've the spirit of a true worker . Help , he 's getting away . He 's got away ! - There he is ! - Stop him ! Don 't let him get away ! Stop ! Quick , after him , there ! - Excuse me ? - Eh ? Trabucco .. How dare you ? Who said you could come in here ? Excuse me Sir .. There 's been a mistake , I came here to denounce the subversives .. .. but they stole my notebook with the list of names . It 's useless to try and save your skin . You introduced this propaganda . - You 're sacked with all the others ! - But I don 't care about that . If Torchio believes I 'm a subversive he won 't strangle me , d 'you understand ? You 're crazy . Stop this ! Get out of here . But Torchio must kill me and now he won 't any more . If you lay a finger on me , I 'll do it myself ! - Would you ? - I 've told you , don 't come near me ! You 've sworn to . Now you 've got to do it . Grab him , he 's deranged ! Deranged am I ? You poor fool . - Fool of an executive . Prehistoric ! - Take him away - Soon , because of me , you 'll be .. .. A madman worse than I am , for all your life and you 'll be fucked ! Like all the bosses on the Earth . Understand ? ... Prehistoric ! Give 100,000 lira to that widow . And bring the police to the gates . There 's going to be trouble tonight . If I can 't find another way .. .. they 'll soon be arriving and will make me stay here on Earth .. .. for the whole life of this stupid creature . What 's happening to me now ? I 've already felt this damn sensation . Yes , when some guy told me I was a conscientious worker . It 's as if for a moment my place had been taken by another . Perhaps a spy from an enemy planet . That 's ridiculous . If that had happened , I 'd have noticed . Anyway , I 've got to clear out at any cost . Maybe there 's still a possibility . - Wasn 't the strike tomorrow ? - Why are you here , it 's dangerous . They 're protesting about all the dismissals . I said I didn 't want to see you when you telephoned . Why did you come ? Come on it 's dangerous ! I must tell you . It 's most important . - Will you listen to me ? - I 've got to take the tram . - Listen , it 's important . - Alright then but hurry . Lucia , you don 't believe that I even touched you the other time .. .. but I committed an unspeakable act on your young body . What ? I have taken away your only wealth and now you must kill me ! Do me this courtesy . You gave me your word a girl guide . But haven 't you made me suffer enough already ? Why now make fun of me by asking me to kill you ? Go away ! You 're pathetic . What a planet of perjury , full of nothing but liars ! A planet of clowns , slackers and thieves .. .. who stole my list of subversives before I could denounce them . - You denounced the workers ? - No , I couldn 't even manage that . - Otherwise I 'd be dead already . - You ! You 're worse than dead . Perhaps it would have been better if they had really killed you .. .. when they did the autopsy . Because since then you 've changed . I don 't know you any more . - It 's as if you 're only half alive ! - What d 'you mean half alive ? I 've awoken all the faculties of the creature . I think as before , eat as before walk as before . - What 's different ? - Now you betray , you hate and hurt ! Ah , now you mean I 'm even more complete . You once told me that one day , we wouldn 't be ourselves . .. but that others would enter into us . Perhaps you don 't remember . It was before your illness . Perhaps you were just joking . But that 's just how you seem now . Someone who doesn 't recognise themself , someone who has no conscience . A what ? - Goodbye Angelo . What 's this feeling ? Lucia ! Wait ! Open up ! Lucia , please , listen to me . I 've hurt you , I 'm a swine . But please , I beg you , believe me ! It 's not my fault I 'm not myself . I 'm not myself , there 's another inside me . For the love of God , not again . It 's awful ! I can 't help it , I swear . I didn 't want to hurt you . Omicron calling Ultra . Omicron calling Ultra . - Lucia I love you . - Ultra to Omicron . A terrible force has just awoken in me . My creature is just revealing our plans . - I 'm losing my strength . - This is an Exceptional Emergency . Kill the creature immediately and return to base to report . - Immediately - OK , in a moment . What 's happening ? What 's pulling me ? I 'm sorry , I didn 't do it on purpose . - It 's not my fault , He pushed me . Not him , another . It 's hard to explain . MOTORISTS ' DAY OF COURTESY I fooled you . No , not again . Don 't throw me down ! Coward , what d 'you want me to do ? No , not the spear . Leave me alone ! Help ! Help me . They want to kill me . Let me go ! Not down there ! D 'you think this is how to get in the trenches ? Comrade , let me escape . But we never run away . I must fight it . My conscience is killing him . - Come on , have a drink . Go back to your ship . Go on then . Angelo , listen to me . have mercy on me . Your damn conscience it killing me . Serves you right . That 's all you deserve . Don 't be stupid . Get up and let me out . By the way , who am I talking to ? Explorer Omicron , of Planet Ultra .. .. that will soon invade the Earth because of you . - Because of me ? - Definitely . Because if you don 't stop it and let me go .. .. they 'll invade , because I can 't warn them of the dangers of a conscience . But I know you , you 've got a radio . And you 'll warn them . But I 'm too weak , I can 't hear it any more . No Angelo , what are you doing ? Don 't fall asleep . Keep on going . It 's over .. Attention . Whoever hears this message in space .. .. take it to the President of the Confederation of Ultra . Giving notice of an Exceptional Emergency . Explorer Omicron , killed in completing his mission . Killed by the inhabited creature that suddenly attacked .. .. with an unknown and deadly force called Conscience . Unfortunately this is a force we are unable to control . But whatever its nature .. .. Omicron , with the authority invested in his being a spatial guinea pig .. .. declares that planet Earth is infected .. .. and that the creatures are uninhabitable . The serious strike which would have paralysed S.M.S .. .. for an indefinite number of days , has been broken . More than 200,000 workers quietly returned to work . The resolute attitude of the management in sacking 40 agitators .. .. after the first ill-judged reactions of yesterday evening .. .. has led the workers to adopt a more responsible attitude . But a serious incident has disturbed this unanimous display of reason . Angelo Trabucco , a disturbed ex-employee of the S.M.S .. .. tried to block , with absurd threats and violence .. .. the peaceful return of the workers .. .. even using ridiculous sci-fi ideas .. .. like invaders from outer space , the conquest of planet Earth .. .. and other absurdities . Security guards from the factory were about to intervene .. .. when Trabucco suddenly collapsed , trying to hold back the workers .. .. and was later pronounced dead of unknown causes . Enough of that . Let 's set down the Workers ' Charter . I recommend that they be introduced gradually . No ! Better strike whilst the iron 's hot . - I agree . - Fine . Point One : Abolition of holidays and all work breaks whatsoever .. Approved . Point Two : Prohibition of love , of speaking and of thinking . Whoever insists on thinking will be punished with amputation of the head . - Agreed . - You can smoke . I suggest amputation for those who insist on loving . Agreed . Point Three : Abolition of emotions . .. of will , of charity and of dignity . .. and other infectious diseases of prehistoric origin . Agreed . Point Four .. Subtitles : Corvusalbus

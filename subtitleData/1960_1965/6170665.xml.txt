 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . Wonderful dinner , Venus . There 's nothing I like better than the old French cuisine . It is . Easy to digest . I 'm glad you liked it . And now you 'll tell us what we are celebrating , Steve ? Hey , I forgot someone 's birthday ? No , do not worry , Professor . Just doing 200 years today the Zodiac first performed at the circus . That 's why I asked you , Venus , to put this crystal ball as the centerpiece of the table . It belonged to my grandmother Tatara Tatara Tatara Tatara . Madame Clara Zodiac . The most far-sighted of all time . I ... I remember reading about it . Of course the rest of the Zodiacs were trapeze artists . Tell us about the Zodiacs , Steve . Okay , but after Matt and I made coffee . We will have the chance to test my new coffee maker . So while we take care of this dangerous mission , you get some rest . Come teacher . It is better to let a preparation extinguisher . Vamos l√° , Steve . It 's ... it 's pretty safe . That 's what you say . CHARITABLE Flying Circus Starring Zodiac Madame Mivea Seer Well , it 's absolutely clear ? You will hold the trapeze cable and he will leave when Steve Zodiac is in the middle of his act . Very clear . When the cable break , and everyone is distracted , I will give the signal to the Nomadianos move . And I will fix the drivers , just to make sure that they can not rescue him . Do not forget . We never met before . Oh dear ! I fixed all the drivers . If someone tries to fly with them , it will shatter . Indeed , Zoonie , I think you 're deaf to music . Well , we will never be good for presentation tonight . Hey , hey , Zoonie . This is wasted time . Lets start all over again . Slower . One , two and ... Oh ! All right . I think , but all this smoke that came along , It is definitely dangerous . Hey , look at that crazy robot . Hey , be careful , do not go getting hurt with this sword . Well , I warned you , Robert . That 's a crazy idea , put you as sword swallower . Do not worry . You 've put in order . That is , to achieve what Professor return my tools . Get away Prof. Matic Well , you all will have a big surprise . Matthew Matic is not fool everyone thinks . I just want to see the face of the Zero when he heard ... What the hell is this ? An old hat 1962 , Mr. Made by one of the most important hatters the old London , Mr. And I need to use it on top of all this ? It is the traditional costume of a master Circus ceremonies , Mr. Oh , well , if it 's for a good cause . Oh , nothing serious with you . Only a blown fuse . I will try to convince Prof. Matic , returning one of my screwdrivers . Mivea telling the leader of Nomadiana caravan . Stage One of the completed plan . A-Ok . Come in . Close the door quickly , please . The brightness of the light destroys my cosmic concentration . Madame Mivea , I was just passing by and wanted to see if he was comfortable . Thank you , Commander . Nothing could be better . I still think I should use a safety net . It 's a long way to the ground . The Zodiac family never used a network . I do not want to be the first member to use one . Ok , Coronel . I can not wait to see the old man with Zero the master of ceremonies clothes . I see you have an old crystal ball , Madame . Oh sim , Comandante And it brings very strange message indeed . What you see now , for instance ? I see ... I see the face of a circus clown . Cosmo the clown ! I 'm me . Oh ! It gave me a fright ! We work together never before , Madame Mivea , just I thought I 'd come here and introduce myself . An unidentified object moving to Space City . There can be a space missile . It is very slow . Best trigger the amber alarm . What is this ? The space ice cream cart . Ambar alarm . Well , nothing to worry about . If you 'll excuse me , I better get back . Clear , Commander . I hope it 's nothing serious . Call the leader of the caravan by the crystal ball , Madame . Say they have been detected . It is according to plan . Ambar alarm . I think we better go down and see what 's going on . You can handle it alone ? Yes , just missing a couple more to arrest , Colonel . Make sure holding well . I do not want to be on hand during the act . There are several of them now , Mr. Almost stopped , as if they were parked . A line of ships , like a caravan . That 's what I think is a caravan . A caravan ? Yes , a caravan of gypsies . After the circus began , returning to pre spatial times Roma are attracted by circuses . They are the Nomadianos . You know what they say : " Never rely on Nomadianos " . It might be better to take a look . I do not want problems in the presentation of the circus . You want to go too , Ninety ? It can be a good experience for you . Ninety go . You 're always saying you 're tired of being ground . Mivea to give caravan leader . Mivea for caravan leader , over . What 's going on with that old fool ? things at the end . Aumente o volume . He is deaf as a space giraffe . Mivea to give caravan leader . Mivea to give caravan leader . ... For the last time ... Mivea to give caravan leader . Are you getting ? Exchange . Caravan leader gives Mivea . Caravan leader gives Mivea . I am receiving you loud and clear . Very high indeed . I may have lived many , many light years , but I 'm not deaf , no . - Silly old goat . - Shhh ! After all , he is our boss . Mivea to give caravan leader . Zodiac is ready to take off . Hold down on the chair , Ninety . I hope that old do not mess around I think you underestimate the leader caravan , my dear . Not long now . Not be long before my people who wandered through space , by light year after year light , will have a permanent location . Earth - the planet most charming of all . Oh , oh ! The impellers jets are failing . Better go down to the warehouse and pick up another . I need to finish this job . Professor Matic , por favor ! This is absolutely ridiculous . I 'm trying to fix the Robert . But it will be very difficult to continue declining to return my own tools . Take your tools . This is absolutely ridiculous . Ohh , that crazy space ! Hello , Ross . Finished ? No . The impeller jet is gone . I was just going to get another deposit . Er .. what about Robert ? She swallowed a lot of sword . He blew his head . That will happen to Cel . Zodiac if I not finish that trapeze . There is . Nomadiana a caravan . A whole row of them . That should be the first leader , unless I 'm wrong . I 'll go have a little chat with him . You better wait here . Steve is going to meet with the leader of the caravan now . Good . Well , he knows the regulations . I do not think the Nomadianos give us work . We will not cause problems , Colonel Zodiac . Of course not , but you know the rules . You must leave at dawn . Eu sei , Coronel Zodiac . We always have to leave the next morning . Tonight will be enough for us . More than enough . Commander Zero , look ! Ken is falling ! His jet impeller must have failed . This is typical of Steve . He always insists a safety net . Yes . To everyone but himself . We go the see Ken is . You need to go back to their own space caravan , if it suspect . I will call the leader of the caravan , the old fool . He is fine . Only suffered a severe atmospheric shock . What happened ? Its impeller jet stopped working suddenly . Here it is . A terrible mess , I guess . I ... I hope your friend 's okay . An unfortunate accident ... I 'm not sure it was an accident . And when the presentation of the circus is going on And I get the signal of our secret agent , we will act . After all , Nomadianos will have a permanent place for them . Everything is understood , my people ? We understand , oh great leader of the Caravan . We , the Nomadianos Gypsies , Who wandered in space for very light-years , We will follow you , great leader of the Caravan the end of the space . Er ... let 's see . Ladies and gentlemen , I have the great pleasure ... . No , erm ... proud ... How are you feeling , Commander ? Terrible . I 'm so nervous . Rather face 30 space missiles to go through this . You 'll be fine when the ring . By the way , you could have someone check my trapeze ? Lieutenant Ninety 're doing it now . Opening and starting , please . Opening and early . Well , that 's it . We better go down now . Ninety goes back to the control room in a minute . Try to stay out of it . PACKED Get going , Zoonie . Keep it up . It does not matter . Try again , Zoonie . Oh no , oh no .

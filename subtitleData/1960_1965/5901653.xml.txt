 - Well , we 're here , Nevsky . - I see , colonel . Rice to crew . Transmit touchdown time and position to mother ship . Let 's have a look at the environment telemetry . Only Child to UN One . Touchdown at 7 hours , 2 minutes , 9 seconds sidereal time . Latitude 3-7 degrees , 8 minutes , 10 seconds ... - What 's it like out there , Stuart ? - The readings are coming through now sir . UN One to Only Child on H. F. UN One to Only Child on H. F. How do you read ? How do you read ? - Rice on U. H. F. High . Do you read me ? - Roger . Loud and clear . - How was the landing ? - Well , we made it in one piece . The environmental conditions are go colonel . We 're putting the survey team down . Sgt. Martin 's entering the escape hatch now . Here 's Nevsky . - Set ? - Go , sir . Roger , Only Child . Your impact point is right on . - Read you loud and clear . - Secure escape hatch . Your systems look good . How does it look out the window ? Decontaminate . The lapse time is 13 plus 10 . This is it , Rice . - The big event . - Release outer lock . Sgt. Andrew Martin , the farm boy from Indiana touched by the finger of fate to be the first man to set foot on the moon . Congratulations are pouring in already from every nation all over the world . Martin ! Stuart ! Well , I didn 't put it there . Hey , colonel , we found something . You 'd better take a look . And here 's something else . " Claimed for her Majesty Queen Victoria in the year of our Lord , 1899 . " - How do we goine to explain this ? - The Kremlin will never believe it . You know it 's like a summons of some kind . " Katherine Callender , " whoever she is . They 'll never believe it . Never . Dymchurch . We better get it on the scanner to Earth before it falls to pieces . Well how am I gonna tell them this ? Queen Victoria . For crying out loud , they 'll think I 'm nuts or something . Rice to Mother ship . Rice to Mother ship . Urgently request UN Space Agency Investigation Team proceed at once to Dymchurch , England . Sgt. Martin is the first man to step foot on the moon ... You 'll see there never was a Katherine Callender . You coming , Dr. Tok ? Don 't forget , England 's the land of eccentrics . ... man on the moon , for the very first time . I hope . Excuse me your Dr. Tok from the U. N. Space Agency ? I 'm from the Express . Could you tell me ... 1899 ? That 's a bit before my time , yes . Well we keep the records over there . Katherine Callender , you say ? Is it a birth , a wedding or a death ? We just want to know if Katherine Callender once lived here . Come this way . - So some crackpot faked it . - Why ? To take the frosting off the UN cake . Mother Empire , still waving the flag . We 'd better start with the births . What . Oh , bless my soul , these are the deaths . Well , you know , it 's weddings , weddings . They always affect me . They do , even now . Look at this stuff . They never affected me , much to my regret . Here we are , C-A ... Callaghan , Calder ... You did say " Callender " ? - Yes , Katherine Callender . - Yes . Well , there 's no record of any Katherine Callender among the births . - You see , she never existed . - The address is Cherry Cottage . - I told you . Bedford , Bedford ... Ha , I remember now . I married her . From Boston , Massachusetts . - Wait a minute . - So there is a Katherine Callender ? - Was . She died some 10 years ago . - This Mr. Bedford is he still alive ? - Yes , if he wasn 't , he 'd be in this book . Over here . Excuse me . Has all this have anything to do with the moon ... Hold it ! Hold it ! Hold it ! You were saying , sir ? Mr. Bedford has been in a nursing home for a long time . Where is it ? Well it 's called the Limes , outside Dymchurch , along the Folkstone Road . Would you like me to let them know you 're coming ? - Let 's have a picture or something . - Oh , come on . Oh , come on . - I 'm trying to find out myself . Go with us to Folkstone Road . - The Limes , the nursing home . The UN Space Agency ? Well , I hope you 're not wasting your time . You see , we 've had trouble before with Mr. Bedford 's obsessions . But if you 'll follow me , I 'll take you up to his room . Obsessions you say ? Sending letters abroad to official bodies . Russian Space Agency National Aeronautic and Space Administration .. ABOUT THE MOON . The moment I saw your credentials , I wondered . - What sort of letters ? - Warnings . Absurd warnings . - Does he know of the expedition there ? - No . We don 't let him watch television . It only excites him needlessly . - Now , must you see him ? - It is necessary . Just the UN party , then . No , you newspaper men are not allowed through . Mr. Bedford . Visitors . Mr. Arnold Bedford ? I 'm Richard Challis , UN Space Agency . Margaret Hoy , Mr. Glushkov and Dr. Tok . Please , sir , won 't you sit down ? I hope you don 't mind us barging in like this but I just want to ask you one question ... - We can save time . Have you ever seen these things before ? My glass . Um , yes . How did you ... How did you find ... You found them on the moon , didn 't you ? - Yes . Yes . There 's been an expedition ? They didn 't tell me . - It 's there now . - There now ? Well they mustn 't , they 're in great danger . - I know . You must stop them . - Please . Matron ? - You must go . - Stop them . They must know . It 's very dangerous for all of them . They 've got to know . Are you seriously telling us that you 've been on the moon and returned ? 1899 . Oh , it 's so long ... Thank you . I 'd been ... I 'd been engaged in an unsuccessful business speculation . To be frank , my creditors were pressing me hard . You see , I 'd always had the idea I could write a play . Wonderful financial possibilities in a successful play . So , I looked for somewhere secluded where I could write . In the end I rented a cottage , out near Dymchurch . I remember , I remember it was along an abandoned canal . - Just one today , Mr. Bedford . - Thank you very much . - Hi . - Infernal contraption ! Hello . - Hello , darling . - Kate . - Was it all right with your relations in London , I mean ? - No trouble at all . They think I 'm at Worthing rehearsing a play . Cherry Cottage . Oh Arnold , it 's lovely . And with a real cherry tree . The moat to my castle . Come on . Watch your step . - All right ? - Thank you . Oh , it 's so beautiful . Careful . - It 's like a postcard . - Well your seeing it at the best time of year . How 's the work going ? - Oh , fine . Fine . - Good . Arnold it 's charming . - It 's the perfect place to write your play . - Well it 's comfortable and quiet . Act 1 , scene 1 . Is that as much as you 've written ? Oh well , you know how difficult it is to start . Yes , darling , I know . You see , the basic idea is the important thing . After that it 's just a question of slogging away . Well I 've got a producer in London who 's clamoring for the manuscript . Oh this is probably something from him here . Excuse me darling . " Rent in arrears , 20 pounds . " Oh well , he 'll just have to be patient . Arnold , it 's perfect . Just my idea of a little old English cottage . It really belongs to you ? Yes , an old aunt of mine retired down here and I was always a praticular favorite of hers . - And well , she left it to me . - Then Arnold , what 's to stop us ? The two of us here , we can get married now . With a London producer 's clamoring for your play ... Or are you just too set in your comfortable bachelor ways ? Oh no Kate , I 'm just as impatient as you , but ... Kate . There 's something you ought to know . You see all my money 's in boots . Yes Army surplus boots from the Boer War . Well I know it will pay off when I find the right customer . But meanwhile , I 'm very much affraid I 'll have to sell cherry the cottage to meet my creditors . Oh , no , Arnold . We 'll think of something darling . Right now , I 'd like to freshen up a bit . The stairs are right here , dear . Well , I can manage quite well alone , darling . - Oh , yes . That 's strange . That 's very strange . Yes . Excuse me , excuse me . I was on my way to the village , and I noticed the smoke . I thought the place was empty , but I ... I 'll explain , I 'll explain . My name is Cavor , Joseph Cavor . How do you do ? Oh , let me help you . - Hello . - Hello . I live in the house across the fields , over there . - Well , I 'm Kate . - Hello . How do you do ? I hope you don 't mind my asking but are you the , the owner of the cottage ? No , Mr. Bedford 's gone to the village . - Mr. Bedford ? Mr. Bedford ? Right . - Won 't you come in ? - That 's very nice of you . Yes , I will thank you , thank you . - He won 't be long . - I hope I 'm not being an intrution . - No , not at all . It 's a delightful little place . I 've known it since I was a boy . No , after you . Thank you . - Please sit down , Mr. Cavor . - Thank you , thank you . - I 'll bring some tea . - That would be nice , thank you . You see , I 'm a research scientist . I 'm on the point of completing a most important scientific demonstration . As a matter of fact , it 's probably one of the most important scientific demonstrations of all time . I 'd like to say how pleased I am to have you and Mr. Bedford as neighbors . The point is , I moved here for the isolation . But Mr. Cavor , we won 't trouble you . That 's just what attracts Arnold , Mr. Bedford I mean . - He needs peace and quiet to write his play . - Oh yes of course I understand . - Well , then , what is it ? - Well , I must tell you there 's a certain amount of risk , even danger connected with my experiments . It might even damage your property . Now if Mr. Bedford would consider selling , I 'd be willing to pay anything , within reason . - You mean you want to buy Cherry Cottage ? - Yes , I do , yes . Yes . - Well , how much were you figuring ? - Well , I 'm , I 'm not very good at this sort of thing . I thought perhaps 1000 pounds , or perhaps a little more . Well , that 's $ 5000 . Yes . Oh , the cottage has been in Mr. Bedford 's family for a very long time . He has a deep sentamental attachment for it . I know , yes . You see the trouble is , my experiments have cost me so much up to now ... Of course , I might be able to double it . But I ... Good Lord ! Good Lord , I forgot . The furnace ! The furnace ! Gibbs ! Gibbs ! Gibbs ! Gibbs ! - Mr. Cavor ! - Gibbs ! Oh . Nearly fell . Gibbs ! - You forgot your bicycle ! - Yes , yes , I have a bicycle . That 's quite right . Arnold . Arnold The most wonderful news . I 've sold the cottage . - You what ? - I 've sold the Cherry Cottage to Mr. Cavor . What that crackpot ? Gibbs , the furnace ! Here . You better take this to him . He forgot it . - Mr. Cavor , I 've come about the cottage . Now , first of all ... - Left the bicycle again , has he ? - Where 's Cavor ? I want to talk to him . - Inside . Door 's open . Someone to see you . - My name is Bedford . - There 's a gentleman here . Ahh , stand by , Gibbs . Any moment ! Now ! Get it quickly , fix that ! The weight 's come off the end ! Cavor , I 've come about the house . - Gibbs , fix that ! - I must get this straight . Gibbs , Gibbs , Gibbs , get the doors . Quick ! - Cavor , you simply must realize ... - Just a little patience . - Just a little patience . Please . Please ! - But you ... - Getting on , you see . - I 'm trying to tell you ... - Cavor , you simply must listen to what I 'm saying to you ! - Just a minute . Just a minute . - Mr. Cavor , my fiancée is in no position ... - Open the door ! Get out of the way , man , very hot . Very hot ! - Cavor ! - Go on , get out . Get out . Mr. Cavor , I simply must get this straight . I ... I 'm not in a position to ... This ... You see ... Kate ... Kate couldn 't possibly sell you Cherry Cottage because ... What is this stuff ? - What ? - What is this stuff ? That 's cavorite . It 's cavorite . Oh , nicely on temperature . Nicely on temperature . Mr. Cavor if you would kindly tell me exactly what it is you 're trying to do , in a simple language , if you don 't mind because you see , I 'm not a scientist . That is , of course , if it isn 't a secret . - It is a secret . It is a secret . - Would you am ... Would you tell me ? Yes , I will tell you . I will tell you . I 'll explain . I 'll explain . Now , you know that you can use screens , like this to cut off light and heat . By the same token , you can cut off Marconi 's wireless rays with sheets of lead . - Nothing , up till now , cuts off the force of gravity . - Oh , gravity . Yes , of course , the , the pull of the earth . - What holds us on the ground . - Yes , that 's right , that 's right . Now , what I 'm experimenting with is a sort of coating , or rather a metallic paste which will , in point of fact , cut off the force of gravity . - Paste ? - Paste . You mean , you mean you paint it on things ? Yes , in a way , yes . Yes . - Like this chair , for example . - You could use that chair . Yes , you could . - May I ? - Please . Yes , I 'll show you . I 'll show you . Takes effect when it hardens . - That 's all ? - That 's all . I see . Are you ... Are you seriously telling me that this chair will lose its weight ? Yes it will . As a matter of fact , we 'll have a job to stop it from rising . - Really ? - Yes . - Well in that case , I 'd better sit in it . - I 'd be careful if I was you because ... - Now , about the cottage ... - It really will go . - As I was saying , Katherine is in no position ... - Be careful ! Your head ! Your head ! Gibbs , the ladder ! This is fantastic ! Cavorite is the most incredible thing I 've ever seen ! - Cavor , can 't you see what this effect will do to the world ? - I warned you ! I warned you ! It will revolutionize shipping , locomotion , ability ... Think of the ways we could exploit this product ! Gibbs ! I 'll get you down . I 'll get you down . We have the chance of a thousand years . We can be rich . - Gibbs ! - Rich beyond belief . I mean just think of it . Think of it . The cartels , the trusts . Cavorite could rule the world . I 'm certain we could make an absolute fortune . Your invention , my brains , my methods ... - Is there anything wrong ? - It 's nothing to do with you . Noting to do with you at all ! Give me that ! - Never mind the ladder ! - What ? Gibbs , you 're an idiot . - I did warn you . - Cavor , never mind . Listen to me . Cavor . About the cottage . It 's yours . What ? Provided you allow me to invest the money in your invention . What do you say ? - Do you think you should ? - Well of course I should ! I 'm a businessman . I can handle patents , process secrets , all that ... Yes of course . It 's settled . Come on , help me down . Oh , by the way ... How had you thought of using cavorite ? Well , nothing very practical , I 'm afraid . - Something like a trip to the moon . - Yes , well of course ... My dear sir ! Now your 'll sign there . That 's the deed assigning Cherry Cottage to you . - Oh , why bring me into it ? - Oh darling , I 've explained . I 'm selling the cottage and it 's got to be done in the proper way . You see , Cavor 's solicitors need papers and documents . I daren 't put my signature to them . If my creditors get wind of the fact I 've come into money , that 's the last I see of it . - You 're sure there 's nothing dishonest about it ? - No , no , no it 's just a legal device . Now , this is the agreement with Cavor . Sign there . On the proceeds of cavorite , I 'll be able to pay off my debts a 1000 times . Arnold , with this money , we 'll be able to get married now . Right away . Oh yes , we could , if I wasn 't putting it into the experiments . What ? - $ 10,000 with that madman ? - But it will make our future , I 'm sure . - What about your play ? The London soliciter ... - Oh the play 's an absolute gamble . - But ... - Darling you must trust me . I 'm doing this all for you . Any day now the experiments will be completed . Arnold Bedford , if you fritter away your money on those lunatic experiments , the wedding 's off ! I 'm packing up and going home to Boston ! Gibbs . Your move . - Look at this . I 've got him now . - Hang on . - You must keep an eye on that furnace . - Yes . Yes , all right . Bedford , old man come in , come in . Oh you got the deeds ? Go into the kitchen , go into the kitchen . Gibbs . Watch that temperature . Any drop could be disastrous . Talk about disaster . What 's he want to interfere for ? - Set them up again . Here , take over for me , will ya ? - Let him do it . I 'm me having tea . - I 'm a metal worker , not a stoker . - Since when 's a gardener 's job stoking a furnace ? Come on , matey . It 'll be just like working with your petunias . I 'm fed up with this lark . - Let 's settle it over a pint at the Box in Daveron . - Now you 're talking . Don 't know why he wants it so blumming hot in here anyhow . Let them see it for themselves , use it . For instance cavorite trays and boots . Boots ! Yes , of course ! Simply enamel the soles and a man would just ... Just like that . That 's right . Oh good , good . I thought of boots last night . Army surplus boots . - You know , it 's one of those basic ideas ... - Only way to do it , really . Well , perhaps not the only way , but for a start . Don 't see why we shouldn 't do it together . Room enough in the sphere for two people . Well now wait a minute . You 're not serious about that idea of going to the moon , are you ? Wasn 't it a joke ? Wasn 't it ? I mean we 'd be firing ourselves off the globe for nothing , absolutely nothing . I mean if there was anything on the moon worth discovering , there might be ... It 's exceptionally high in minerals . - Minerals ? - Minerals . - Including gold ? - Including gold . Mind you , there 's a theory that the minerals on the surface of the moon are not in a molten magma but dotted about in nuggets . Rather like raisins in a fruitcake . Better than weightless boots , isn 't it ? Come on , I 've got something to show you . I 've got something to show you . How far would it be ? What , to the moon ? Yes . About a quarter of a million miles . About quarter of a million ... Come on . You 'll have to forgive this confusion , untidiness . I 'll really get it cleared up one day . Oh , my goodness ! That 's much too high . It 's to carry the hot gases from the furnace . I 'll explain later . I 'll explain . Come on . I 'll explain . It 's all right ! It 's all right ! He 's a friend ! He 's a friend ! My guards . Much better than dogs . They 're quite harmless , really . There 's Gwendoline , Aristotle . Come on . - Hey , it 's hot in here ! - 123 degrees ! - No ? - Yes ! Come on ! Out of the way , out the way ! The sphere . - You 've actually built it . - Yes ... .. Yes It 's taken time , mind you . Years , years . Well , here it is . The sphere . It 's double-walled , you see . Now there 's a shell inside that 's complete . But then there 's this outer frame that 's covered with roller blinds and old railway buffers . The blinds will be covered with cavorite . Yes and ... and when they 're extended , they 'll cut off the force of gravity . Yes , you see that 's right . That 's very good . That 's right . You see you open and shutter blinds to cut off gravity let 's say from the Earth moon or any other bodies in space . - Space . You really mean it . I 'll tell you something . If the last batch of cavorite is successful we start coating the sphere tonight . It 's in the furnace now . It 's all rather exciting , isn 't it ? I really must say , I 'm ... - Opening all right ? - Yes , perfectly . Good ! Oh , my little kingdom . - What happened ? - I don 't know ! The furnace ... . Gibbs ! ... . Gibbs ! Well , come on , Bedford old man , hurry up ! Oh , Bedford , hurry ! Gibbs ! ... Gibbs ! ... Gibbs ! I 'll be back . I 'll be back ! I 'll be back ! Darling you 're all right . I thought something had happened to you . Something happened all right . I told Gibbs to keep an eye on that furnace ! They 're sacked . The lot of them . Bedford , from now on , you stoke it . - But it exploded ! - No , it worked ! It worked ! It really worked ! - I 'll say it did ! - Now we know it 's enough power to lift the sphere ! What 's he talking about ? What does he mean ? Those diving suits . - You 're not thinking of deep-sea diving ! - Madam ... . I 'll explain . You see , what keeps water out , keeps air in . You see ? - Hey Bedford , you know that might be fun , walking around in a complete vacuum . - Cavor , don 't ... As far as we know , there is no atmosphere on the moon . I 've got a book on it . I 'll go and check ! I 'll go and check ! I 've got a book on it . Excuse me ! Excuse me ! I 've got a book . The moon ? Ah , you see , Kate , ah we were planning ah a little expedition to test the effects of cavorite . On the moon ? You 're both raving mad ! Both of you ! It 's throwing your lives away ! - The moon ? - Yes darling , you see , I was just waiting for the opportunity to tell you all about it . You never breathed a single word and all the time you were planning to go ... on this lunatic expedition ... - Oh , darling , I ... - " Lunatic " is just the word ! Go ahead , blow yourself to bits . I don 't care if I ever see you again ! Oh , Kate , you ... Oh , Cavor . - --- Kate ! Well done , Bedford ! Pour on more coal ! Keep up the steam ! Well done ! Get out of the way ! Out of the way ! Well done , Bedford , old man ! Keep it up ! Keep it up ! Bald-headed old ... Madam ! Madam ! You must remember to keep those doors closed otherwise you 'll ruin the whole experiment ! I mean , look it 's down to 110 degrees ! What on earth have you got there ? I 've brought a few useful things for Arnold . Though I wouldn 't want him to know it . Just his gin and bitters and a few personal things . - Gin and bitters , gin and bitters . Personal things . Like an elephant gun ! - It 's a sensible precaution . - You don 't know what you 'll meet . - What about these things ? What about these animals ? Oh well , I brought some fresh food too . All those tinned supplies , it 's not healthy . Madam , you have thought about feeding them , I suppose ? Oh yes . There 's a whole sack of chickenfeed in the back of the ... No . Mrs. Bedford , no . I 'm sorry . There 's no room . You 'll have to leave the lot . I very sorry but you 'll just ... The temperature ! The temperature ! Oh , my goodness ! The temperature ! Chickens , gin and bitters , guns ... I don 't know . Mr. Cavor . Should you run out like that when you 're so overheated ? You 'll catch cold ! Will you close those blasted doors ! Bedford , give me that . The greenhouse temperature is down by 15 degrees . - Well , it 's not possible . - That woman of yours keeps mooning around ! - She won 't leave those doors alone ! - Kate 's still here ? Of course she still here ! Tell her to go home ! Just tell her to go home ! And Bedford , don 't be too long ! We 're leaving within an hour . - I 'd thought you 'd gone . - I brought you a few things for your journey . Thanks . Oh Arnold , why did you have to get mixed up in this ? Oh , don 't go . Change your mind . It 's not too late . Please . But it 's only for a few weeks , Kate . It 's not as if it were forever . If you go , it may as well be forever . And I won 't be here when you get back . And I mean it this time . So make a decision here and now . It 's Cavor or me . When you decide , I 'll be at the cottage . Oh come on Bedford ! I 've banked the fires . We haven 't got much time . Come on . Those doors ! That woman will be the death of me . Thank the Lord I never got married . My mother warned me . She was right . My goodness , she was right . - Oh , Arnold , I 'm so glad ... - Evening . Katherine Callender ? - Yes . I give formal notice that " This summons is served on behalf of the landlord of Cherry Cottage . " - Summons ? - Just a minute , please . I believer there 's been an illegal attempt to transfer the title deed to a third party . " And your signature is on this paper . But Mr. Bedford inherited the cottage from his aunt . Cherry Cottage is the sole property of our clients Bascombe G. Osgood , and we 'll see you in court , madam . Goodnight . Come along , Bassie . Lies . Lies from beginning to end . - Well , that 's everything , I think ? - No , that 's not everything . - What ? - I 've forgotten something . - What ? - I don 't know what it is . Oxygen cylinders ? - No , no , no . - Glasses ? - No . I 've got those . - You left the gas running ? - No , I haven 't left the gas running . I 've got it . It 's very important , very important . I 've got it . I 've got it . Ladies and gentlemen , this is a solemn moment . liberty is at hand . Goodbye , Gwendoline , Victoria . Thank you , I shall always be grateful for everything you 've done . Come on , man . The time 's running short . Come on . Liberty , my friends ! Liberty ! Be back as soon as I can . Oh , my goodness . Come on , Cavor , hurry . - All right Cavor ? - Yes . Thank you . Oh . Ah well , we 're nicely on temperature . Oh , Bedford old man . This is a solemn moment in the history of mankind . Man into space for the first time . Future generations will long remember us . As long as we 're not blown into smithereens . Bedford , please , please . Now , put your hands and your arms through the nets like this . Because there might be a violent shock coming . Arnold Bedford , you come out of there ! You can 't go off leaving this in my ... Any moment now . Any moment now , I can feel it . - We 're off ! - Open up . - Open up ! Mr. Bedford , open up ! - What 's that ? - It 's Kate . - That woman ! That woman ! She 's impossible . She 'll be blasted to death . - Open up ! - Bedford , get her inside ! Get her inside ! - Hurry , for heaven 's sake ! - Hurry ! I 'm stuck . I can 't move . You 'll be all right Mrs. Bedford . We 'll stop accelerating at any moment now . Where are we ? What 's happening ? Just as I predicted , shot into space with the speed of a bullet . - I 'll put magnets in your shoes . - Space ? - I think I 'm gonna be sick . - Well old on to the handgrips woman ! You had no right to take me . I only came to have it out with Mr. Bedford . - We had no choice , did we Mrs. Bedford . - Please stop calling me Mrs. Bedford ! - We 're not married . - We 're not likely to be . Ever ! Not married ? Kindly leave the room . Kindly leave the room . For what we are about to receive , may the Lord make us truly thankful . Amen . Oh . There 's the Pole star . We 're nicely on trajectory . Can you see , Kate ? - Close that blind ! - I was only trying to see out . - Can 't you steady this thing ? - Ruined . All my calculations , ruined . - I 'm sorry . - Sorry ? Madam , we 're headed straight for the sun ! Poor darling , he must be exhausted . This is the first time he 's closed his eyes since we left . Who knows how long that 's been ? No days , no nights up here . Well , I don 't need a chronometer to know what time it is . It 's breakfast time , and I 'm sick of sardines . Chickens . Aah . That means fresh eggs . Katie . - Katie , you 're an angel . - Not that you deserve it . - Oh , Katie , darling ... - Don 't you Katie me . Leaving me in the larch with a summons . The nerve ! Well , I never dreamt they 'd be on to it so soon . And I 'll pay the man back . Anyway , who else do you know that would go to all the way to the moon for you ? You 're impossible . - What was that ? - Nothing . - Are you feeling all right ? - Yes . I was just doing a few barnyard impersonations . - I was reared on a farm , you know . - Really ? Just a minute . Excuse me . Excuse me . You didn 't dare . You didn 't dare ! Geese , I adore . Chickens , I detest . I 've a good mind to make you fly home . All of you . My calculations ! How I hate chickens ! - We seem to be getting some of our weight back . - Yes , about a tick . It 's the pull of the moon , you see . We 've got to control it , you see . It mustn 't be too fast . Mare Imbrium . Ideal for landing . Nicely on target . Yes . Now , we use the Earth to slow down our rate of descent . - Anything I can do ? - Well , everything needs lashing down . Take that and that . - Katie , put that away . - Oh , all right . Landing positions . Hold on tight , Kate . Arnold . What ? Are you all right Kate ? I think so . Where 's Cavor ? I think I 've gone blind in one eye . Thank you . Oh . What a relief . I 'll get a new pair when I get back . Just a broken glass . It 's incredible . Yes . We 're down . We 're down . We did it ! We did it ! WE DID IT ! - I never thought we would . - Well neither did I. At least , I wasn 't absolutely sure . - Well , what now ? - I suppose ... . explore ! Explore . Here , your suit . There 's your suit . Boot . Here 's your other boot . Now wait a minute . There 's no pressure outside , which means the moment the hatch is opened , the entire sphere is a vacuum which will be fatal for Kate because we only got two suits . No , No ! That 's it , nobody goes outside . She 'll be quite safe in the airtight compartment . - In there ? No , no . It 's out of the question . - I 'll be all right , Arnold . You sure ? Don 't worry about me . All right . Let 's make some room . Here . Just a minute . Just a minute . Would you bring those things here , please ? Madam , the chances of bagging an elephant on the moon are remote . We won 't need this . Told you before . Now , give me the flag . A claim . Yes , definitely we 've got to stake a claim . Take a letter . Sit down . Take a letter . You 'll find some paper in my coat pocket . Claimed for Her Royal ... No , not royal , not royal , not royal . Claimed for Her Majesty Queen Victoria in the year of our Lord ... - What is the year of our Lord ? - 1899 . 1899 . Now , I 'm leaving the oxygen full on . Now , Kate , get in . - Now you can open the hatch from the inside . Wait for my signal to open the hatch . - All right . Here 's your helmet . Don 't forget : when we get outside if you wanna speak , touch helmets . Otherwise , we won 't hear each other clearly . What 's wrong with the blessed thing ? It worked perfectly all right in England . I asked for a seven-and-three-eighths . They said it was a seven-and-three-eighths . Six-and-a-quarter . I 'll have to put it down to shrinkage . Hello , moon . My goodness . Amazing sensation ! Light as a feather ! Look ! Top of that rock ! Look ! Top of that rock ! You all right ? No discipline , this moon . We 'll be smashed to pieces . Bedford , old man , isn 't it magnificent ? It 's empyreal . An empire Caesar never dreamed of . Yes . We 'll be in all the newspapers . Cavorland . Bedfordshire . That 's for you ! That 's for you ! We 'll be famous , knighted by the queen ! The queen ! Give me that , give me that ! I claim the moon in the name of our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria . You 're getting too much oxygen . You 're actually drunk . - Let 's check your gauge . - That 's wonderful . I feel like an eagle ! Geronimo ! Cavor , come down ! Help . Help . S. O. S. Help ! Thank you . - You need a lead , old chap . - Yes , I think I probably do . Cavor , you hear that ? Hold on Cavor ! I 'll get you down . Bedford , Bedford , your helmet ! Your helmet ! It must have ... But I can breathe Cavor . There 's air down here . Take this off . Take this off . That 's better . There 's a subterranean atmosphere here . Listen . - We got to get back to get Kate . - Without your helmet , you won 't get 20 feet . We 'll just have to find it . There 's a way down . What ? Now keep it tight , all right ? All right ? All right . Yes . Go on , I 've got it , go on . You 're all right , go on . Go on , that 's it . Throw me your helmet . All right . Bedford . Look at that prism assembly . Only thing I want to look at is that helmet . I know we should have brought that gun . Cavor , it 's fantastic . What is it ? - It 's a moon creature , a Selenite . - But the size . Yes , it 's the low gravity . Bedford . Leave them ! Cavor ... . Help me , Cavor ! No , you 're making a mistake . Leave them , Bedford . Leave them ! Leave them ! Well , you 've certainly given them a taste of human violence . They will be here in the thousands and you shall be running from gallery to gallery . - Oh , we 're not improving our chances by standing here . - I should have come on my own . I knew I should have come on my own . Are you staying here or are you coming with me ? If only we 'd , if only we could have communicated with them . Just talk to them , it was such a marvellous opportunity . The meeting of two worlds . Cavor , come on ! I knew I should have come on my own . The sphere 's gone ! Well there 's the flag 's right where we put it . The controls . She must have touched the controls . Selenites , thousands of them . They dragged it . This time ! Now ! Block it , Cavor ! ... Block it ! All this clutter . The place is an absolute honeycomb . Can you see a trail , Cavor ? Leave me alone ! Stay away from me or I 'll shoot . I will ! Get away from there . I said stay away or I 'll shoot ! Down there ! What is it ? I don 't know . Probably a harmless vegetarian . Bred for food , rather like a cow . If that 's a cow ? I wouldn 't like to meet a bull . Come on , Cavor ! - " Harmless vegetarian " yah ? - Well , I thought I ... Cavor ... Give me your hand ! Cavor Run ! Run , Cavor , run ! Run . What , what do you want ? What do you want me to do ? No , please , don 't . What do you want me to do ? Let me out of here ! Can you hear me ? Let me alone , can 't you ? Staring at me like an animal in a zoo . You ! You there , with my shoe . Give it back , or I 'll let you have the other one . You ! You there , with my shoe . Give it back , or I 'll let you have the other one . You ! You there , with my shoe . Give it back , or I 'll let you have the other one . So , imitating me now . You think it 's funny , do you ? Very funny . Very funny . You think it 's funny , do you ? Very funny . Kate ... .. Miss Callender . Just a minute . Just a minute . Oh , Mr. Cavor , I 'm so glad to see you . Where is Arnold ? Is he safe ? Yes , yes he 's safe . We got separated . Give me my shoe . Very funny . Give me my shoe . Very funny . They 're trying to communicate with us . Analysing what we say . I wish they 'd stay off the words with E 's in them . Man . We come from Earth , many hundreds of thousands of miles away . No , no it doesn 't mean a thing . Nothing at all . Man . Man ! Did you hear that . They 're trying to communicate with us . Why that 's imperial ! It 's absolutely ... Man , man ! From hundred of thousands of miles away . Man from Earth . Kate , you see , they understand , but they 're not repeating what I say . That 's splendid ! It 's splendid ! It 's absolutely imperial . Yes , my dear fellow , it is ! It 's absolutely imperial ! Well it 's obviously some sort of apparatus for generating oxygen on a vast scale . That 's why we 're able to breathe down here . That 's fantastic . It 's fantastic . I 'd say it 's perpetual motion , if it wasn 't impossible . Why it makes all other forms of power obsolete . Look , that 's where they 're getting their power , from sunlight . Kate , come . Come quickly . Quick . - They 're taking the sphere apart . - We must stop them . Quickly , hold my hand . Carefully . You 've no right to do this . Leave it alone . It doesn 't belong to you . Now we 'll never get home . It 's cavorite . We have tried to duplicate the substance coated on your sphere , but unable . - Well , it 's called cavorite . - Cavorite . It 's a compound of elements . Well , it 's based on the use of helium . - Ought you to tell them that ? - Helium ? It 's a light , inert gas found in the atmosphere on Earth . Well , you must know helium . - No more questions for now . - For now ? For now ? What do you mean , " For now " ? - What 's happening ? - Chemical workers put to sleep until needed again . You will return to the examination chamber . Well , it 's a unique way of dealing with unemployment . Entirely reasonable , I suppose . They 'll treat us the same way if they find they have no further use for us . What a ghastly thought . Ghastly thought . Is he dead ? No . No , he 's not dead . He 's asleep . It 's a sort of suspended animation . This is rather interesting , you know . According to my almanac there 's a lunar eclipse on the 12th . An eclipse ? You know , an eclipse , when the Earth passes directly between the sun and moon . Now , that 's obviously a resting time for the Selenites . Yes . It 's time you rested too , you know , Miss Callender . - It 's a long time since we landed . Come on . - An eternity . Oh , Mr. Cavor , I 'm so worried about Arnold . Yes , Arnold . - Do you think we will ever see our world again ? - Of course we will . - I 'd even welcome a London fog . - Would you , now ? Come on , you really must try to get some sleep . Lie down there . I wish I could and wake up to find it 's all been a bad dream . You quite comfortable ? ... Sure ? - Thank you . - Right . - Awe put that away . You don 't need a gun . - I don 't have your boundless confidence in these insects . Well you don 't try to understand them . You see they 're a different society ... - Oh , we 're wasting time . I 've got to find Kate . - Kate , she 's all right . I 've just left her . You know where she is ? For heaven 's sake man , tell me , so I can fix the sphere and we can get going . - Not yet . - What do you mean ? No , no I want time ... I wanna know where Kate is . Tell me where she is ! Don 't spoil it . I want to communicate with them ! - Where 's Kate ? - Give me time ! You 'd better get away . You 'd better get away . Here , here . Lift . Kate get right back ! Come on Kate ! Hurry ! First of Earthmen , welcome on the moon . I am here before you . Your earth is the center of our orbit . Tell us of its life how it differs from ours . Well , I don 't know where to begin . I don 't know whether you can understand me , whether you can hear me . Well , I 'll try . Man . Man lives on the surface of Earth in protective structures . Not protective . That 's the wrong word . Buildings ! Houses , cottages . We call them cities , towns . It 's rather like your tunnels , but on the outside . That would explain the dark areas we have observed . Does not the sun blind you , living on the surface ? No ... No ... No , you see we have an iris , which protects the eyes . Come closer . I wish to see . Yes , sir , certainly . There , you see ? Please , the light , that 's . That 's hurting . Please . Kate , drop the cylinder and help me . Hand me that wrench . - Is there much left back there ? - Only the oxygen cylinders . I just hope that Cavor can keep the Selenites occupied a little longer . You say men cling to different tongues and beliefs . Is there not one ruler ? No . No . Every century , some despot tries , but up till now , no one 's succeeded . Like Hannibal , Julius Caesar , Napoleon ... Does this not lead to confusion ? Yes , it does , and worse . Starvation , hostility even war . Tell me ... of war . Tell you of war ? Oh , my goodness . Well it usually starts with a wacking great explosion . Now try the one over the porthole . It 's still not working . Well , I bolted it back like the others . Nothing else to do . I 'll have to go get Cavor . - I 'll go with you . - No , Kate stay here and pack the rest of the things . I know where to find him . I shan 't be long . And yet to fight in a war is considered an honor . Well , it 's difficult to explain , but men who are killed in battle are heroes . That 's odd , isn 't it ? Men enjoy to make war ? No ... . No , they detest it . Then if they make war , they are defective . Well , we 're not perfect . Mankind is still developing . We 're not , we 're not perfect . There are men of peace ! My concern is with the men of violence , the men who kill . Soon others will be coming from Earth . Our galleries will be strewn with dead . There needn 't be any others ! There needn 't be any others ! I am the only one who holds the secrets of cavorite . Then you and your secret will remain here , on the moon . - Cavor ! Cavor , this is not an audience . You 're on trial ! No Bedford , no . Can 't you see ? - No ! You 've just been convicted ! To the sphere ! - This way . - What ? - Through there . - All right . - Why didn 't you leave me ? - Don 't flatter yourself , I didn 't risk my neck to save you . Go on . - The sphere . You 've put it together . - Yes , but the blinds won 't work . The blinds won 't work . Good Lord . You 've destroyed everything I 've set out to accomplish . - Now you turn to me for help . - Who else can we turn to ? Please , please , Mr. Cavor . Well , all right , I 've no right to keep you here , I suppose . All right , come on . Give me your hand . Come on . Come on , the cylinders . Take the other end , Kate . Bedford , it 's working , old man . It 's working . Come on , hurry . Come on , I got it working . Come on . Come on . Kate , get inside , quick ! - Go on , Kate . Go on . - Go on ... Good . Come on , Bedford . Right , come on , up you go . Quickly , quickly . Cavor ... . the cylinder ! Hurry , Cavor . Cavor , your hand ! Give me your hand ! You know how to man the controls . - You don 't need me . - Cavor. don 't be a fool ! Come back . You see ... I 'm staying , Bedford , old man . There 's a lot to learn . - Mr. Cavor ! - Cavor , come back ! I 'll explain . I 'll explain . One day , I 'll explain . We were hurled into space . Well , one way or another , I managed to guide the sphere back to Earth . We ... we plunged into the sea off the coast of Zanzibar . The sphere disappeared without a trace . But Kate and I managed to swim ashore . Of course , no one ever believed our story . I mean , there was no evidence , nothing . - Until now . - Oh , I still can 't believe it . Our own Mr. Bedford , a real astronaut . - The first astronaut . - Dear Mr. Bedford , I must tell the others . There he is . Okay , it 's gone through to them . Red alert for lens pits or other accesses and Selenites . Those creatures , maybe they 're not dangerous after all . He got away . - They 've had years to get ready for us . - Get out of here ! Please , ma 'am . Hold it there . They 've gone down . They 've broken through the lens pit . And here they are , deep below the surface of the moon . They light flares to see their way . That 's where we were there . More evidence of civilization , it appears to be a lunar city . But who built it and why ? It 's starting to crumble , collapsing before our very eyes . The astronauts will have to come to the surface before they are trapped and they 're being hauled up on nylon ropes . It 's like an abandoned mine caving in on top of them . They 're through and into the open ! And it 's crumbling right beneath them ! Corrosion and decay . Everywhere , the same story . There seems every evidence of some kind of contamination . - Some simple germ brought from Earth . - To creatures completely without immunity . Under those conditions microorganisms could run wild . Multiply . Kill a whole population . Did they take off to another planet , or were they wiped out by an all conquering virus ? Poor Cavor . As deadly as a plague or as infectious as a common head cold in the head . And what happened ? He did have such a terrible cold .

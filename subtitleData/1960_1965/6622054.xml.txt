 - Thanassis Vengos . - Present . - Stavros Ksenidis . - Present . - Kostas Voutsas . - Present . Have a look at that , mate ! Wow , mate ! Alas , poor Greece ! Someone tell me what we are going to do about that ! Can you tell me , Madame ? So rightly said , my young man ! So rightly said ! - Quiet ! - Yes , " quiet " ! Everything to keep our peace and quiet ! Leave us alone , mate ! Haven 't you got anything else to say ? Other nations are progressing , are going to the stars and we just enjoy our sleep , that 's all we do ! - There ! We 're sleeping ! - You 're not in your right mind , sir ! Hey , Mister ! How can you sleep ? Who gave you the right to sleep ? The gentleman speaks the truth . Why are you sleeping ? - Did you see that , sir ? - Certainly I did ! - Sit down , please ! - Let 's sit down , my dear . - I must thank you , my young man ! - Quiet ! What you said made me particularly glad and I 'd like to ask you now to go out together because I have some extremely interesting plans to announce you . - Sure , I 'll follow you , sir ! - Follow me , then . Do come in . Please ! Come in ! - Sit down , please . - I 'm too excited to sit , Professor . Looking for someone like you for ages I 'm deeply moved that I found you now ! I have found in you my spiritual successor , my son ! - Doctor ! Benefactor ! Sage ! - I 'll find vindication at last ! The time of recognition of my work has come ! My long-time scientific research ! I keep sending my work to the Academy , the Polytechnic School , the University ! - They ignore it , reject it , deride it ! - Shame on them ! But now the time of my vindication has come ! Here it is ! My inquiry on Saturn . - Mars ! - Wow ! Gemini ! - Scorpius ! - That was a pin ... - Venus ! - Venus must have tired you out . Work ! Work ! There remains only the implementation of my theory ! I just wanted a young man with technical experience and scientific authority so as to proceed with the experimental verification . I 'm on your side ! Full technical training ! Oxy welding , fish glue , zinc ointment , bricklaying , varnish , everything ! Splendid ! Splendid ! Now about the craft ... Everything ! Craft , dinghy , cart , common carrier - - Caution ! Wet paint ! - Splendid ! Now as concerns fuel ... - Everything , doctor ! Firewood , lignite , coke , oil , kindling for fire and so on ! Splendid ! Now about funding , I have the financial ability to meet all the needs of this project . We have a sponsor , then everything 's all right ! - Everything else is just details . - Of course , details ! Where have you been all this time ? Eh ? Please , leave me alone , dear Adrianne . I 'm having the most serious scientific discussion with Mr Thanassis . It 's 11 : 00 ! Drink your milk and off to bed ! I don 't want milk ! I don 't like milk ! - I don 't like it . - You 'll drink it ! I don 't like milk , I 'm telling you ! You will drink it and I 'll put you to bed now ! I don 't want to go to bed ! I don 't want ! Mr Thanassis , please take her out of here ! All right , calm down . - Just a moment , my young woman ... - It 's none of your business ! What if my uncle gets sick and something bad happens to him ? What am I going to do , a girl alone ? You 'll drink it , you 'll drink it , you 'll drink it ! Let me bottle feed him and we 'll finish our talk in two minutes . - Only two minutes ! - Only two . - He 'll drink his milk as well . - He 'll drink his milk as well . I 've got my plan . We 'll run away . I own a lodge by the sea with a large warehouse . We 'll get my theoretical work out of here and set up our lab there as well as our rocket launch site . All right but when ? Your niece is not joking . Tomorrow is Sunday and Adrianne goes to church . I 'll tell a trusted friend of mine that owns a car to help our relocation . That 's all right then ! The milk now ... I can 't drink it . - Shall I ? - Please ! Did he drink it ? - Yes , he did . - Fine . Off to bed now ! I 'll be going now . Good night , Professor . - We 'll talk some other time . - Yes , yes ... - Farewell , Miss Adrianne . - Farewell . Do you by any chance want me to give him another cup of milk ? - No , no I don 't want to ... - All right , I just asked . Off to bed now ! Next morning , with the first ring of the bell ... - You 're already here , Mr Thanassis ? - Certainly . I explain the reasons behind my absence in this note here . My dear friend Polykarpos arrives anytime soon . - Let 's pack up my writings . - Of course . Are you here , Polykarpos ? Let me introduce you to my assistant and lab director . Come on ! Come closer ! Come on . Shake your hands . Come on , don 't be afraid ! - Pleased to meet you . - The pleasure is all mine . - Ah ! It 's a human ! - What else could it be , Polykarpos ? Dunno ! I just saw his hand hanging on its own . We must all help the move-out . Let me open the door for him . You better relieve him of some of the excessive load . - Are they heavy ? - No , they 're lightweight . Get another bloody pack to finish off the job ! My dear Polykarpos we have to stay for a long time away from home because of a scientific inquiry . Agreed ? - Scientific ? - Exceptionally scientific . - Scientific ? - Of course . - Will we eat food ? - My dear ! Forget science and let 's start carrying things , doctor . - Come on , doctor . - Come , follow me . Don 't stay in the city on Sundays ! Incredible velocity must be reached during the launch of the spacecraft in order to overcome earth 's gravity . Like a bullet ! A thousand times faster than a bullet , my dear ! There will be astonishing speeds . We must reach a speed of 12,000 km per second . 12,000 km per second ? Doctor ! Benefactor ! Sage ! For Venus we must reach even greater speed . 18,000 km per second . For Saturn , 22,000 km per second ! And for Neptune , we must reach the amazing speed of 26,000 km per second ! Of course ! Astonishing speeds ! - What do you want , Polykarpos ? - Could you push a little ? Certainly . Open the door please . Having enough thrust for my rocket to move through atmosphere was the most important problem I had which was solved by ... Push with force please , Mr Thanassis . The most important problem , I repeat , which was solved by the immense speed that when is equal to the drag force allows a spacecraft to move on without any further acceleration - You mean without pushing ? - Exactly ! - Doctor ! Benefactor ! Sage ! - You certainly realize that the problem of fuel was central in my studies . Today , this moment , after long , strenuous intellectual labour I 'm in the pleasant position announcing that I know the simplest solution to this problem . Allow me to safeguard this secret for the time being , dear Thanassis , even from you so we won 't regret its acquisition by others entirely lacking scientific authority . I 'm hearing from journalistic sources that our main competitors , Americans and Russians , consider the solution of solid fuels as the most efficient but I ought to declare my insistence on liquid fuels . Our success relies on their mixture ratio as well as on the addition of one of the most common elements which generates immense propulsion . That 's how the problem of fuels is solved once and for all . Fuel ? Hey you , what 's wrong with the car ? Nothing 's wrong . It just ran out of fuel ... Sea is always blue ... Well , we must start carrying things . I 'd like the two of us to discuss about the arrangements in the lab . Great . Then let Polykarpos start carrying things Polykarpos , you can start . Is that so ? Why not then ? I have given a lot of thought to the transformation of this place into a scientific laboratory . - We 'll get rid of these . We are going to use this spot here to install the scientific instruments . Reactor ... monitors ... panels ... goniometer ... Got it . Pincers , screwdrivers , hammers , adhesive paste ... We 'll leave this space empty for setting up our craft . What craft ? I don 't understand . Why do we want a boat ? For our spacecraft , of course ! In this corner we will position the lab animals which will be the first to be sent into space before the first astronaut . - Down over there ? Here we 'll set up the meteorological department and , lastly , here ... - The dynamo ! - The power installation . - That 's what I mean , the dynamo ! I got it first . One month of hard work ... - Doctor ! Benefactor ! Sage ! - I 'm so moved ! How many years I waited for this moment ! How many years of intensive work in the shadows ! I 'll enjoy at last the fruits of my labour ! - Where do we lead science , doctor ? - Science always moves forward . - Always forward ... - What a masterpiece of perfection ! How delicate ! Cough ! What the hell am I saying ... Gloves ! Scissors ! It 's all right . That 's it . Screwdriver ! Hacksaw ! Bodkin ! Clothes peg ! Clothes peg ! Clothes peg ! You were amazing ! Back to work now ! Right . We haven 't got much time . Dog , man 's faithful companion ... I 'm going to ... - Mourgos and Valentina . - Splendid ! Splendid ! They look dogs of the highest intelligence and noblest descent ! Nah , they 're mongrels . How you dare talk like that to doctor ? You dare comment on his scientific observations ? I can 't cooperate with him , Professor . Keep calm , dear Thanassis . No way ! His words , the expression on his face ! I can 't ! There 's nothing scientific in him ! - But they 're stray dogs ! - Mind your own business ! Do only what you 're told . Now and ever ! - Please calm down . - Bring them inside quickly . And now we enter a new phase in our experiments . Experimental observation and scientific preparation of the two dogs that will be sent into space . I know that , mate . Rabies treatment , tick bites , fleas , lice ... Hey ! - What ? Are you giving them bread ? - It 's wheat bread ! - What " wheat bread " ? - From kneaded dough ! You are absolutely right , Mr Thanassis . From this day on dogs will follow a scientific diet . We are going to observe how they react to simulated space environment under two different situations : First , of overnourishment , and , second , of undernourishment . One week they gormandize , next week they starve to death . - But in a scientific manner . Right ? - Exactly . They will at the same time undergo medical exams . Cardiograms , analyses , checks etc . Meanwhile , you 'll take the responsibility for something . Every morning and every evening you 'll take them out to have a wee so we won 't mess up the place . Right , doctor ? It 's not good for a scientific lab . You 're assigned with this task . I 'll hold you responsible . - Morning and evening . - Morning and evening . All right . Take them out now . - But it 's noon now ! - So what ? Will this count as their morning walk or as their evening walk ? Cut the crap and take them out now . Of the noblest descent , my foot ! Bloody mutts ! And now you want a power pole , eh ? Well , there 's no pole for you ! Get up ! Can you settle for a tree ? Hey , move away ! - Stop quarrelling ! - We are not ! Come now ! Stop pestering me ! Splendid ! - Splendid but ... - But ? - What 's troubling you , Mr Thanassis ? - Something is worrying me terribly . Please explain yourself . - International espionage ! - Good heavens ! We must consider all possibilities , doctor . It never occurred to me . Don 't you ever read about the Americans and Russians ? Espionage , counter-espionage , FBI , Deuxième Bureau etc . Big jobs ! Surveillance aircraft , submarines , secret codes ... So we are lost ! O beloved homeland ! Ill-fated Greece ! You were deprived of your last opportunity for glory , the conquest of space . We must get organized , go on counteroffensive . - You talk about us , Mr Thanassis ? - Of course ! We have to consider our responsibility towards history and future generations . We must strike down the enemies of science ! - Mr Thanassis ! - Strike them down mercilessly ! Spies of the enemy will try to infiltrate our ranks if they haven 't made it already . That 's why I propose we check the members of the Central Committee one by one . What are you saying ? What do you hint at ? In any case , I am not one . So we come now to the second Committee member . - To you , doctor . - I 'm innocent ! - Are you sure ? - I am , Mr Thanassis . - You don 't confess , do you ? - No , I don 't ! - So you don 't confess ? - I 'm innocent ! - Innocent , eh ? - That 's right ! All right , we know that . - Do we ? - Of course we do . - And now we come to the third member . - Who ? Polykarpos ? Yes , this one . - You think so ? - I don 't like his expression . He is a suspect ! A suspect ! - What 's wrong with him ? - I haven 't got any evidence yet . but he 's a suspected spy ! - My God ! - Where 's he now ? - Didn 't you send him out with the dogs ? Ah , he 's with the dogs ... We 'll check that . There ! Onions and bread in a scientific lab ! Mr Thanassis ! He 's nowhere to be found . Let 's go to the beach . - You realize why , eh ? - No . - A submarine ! - Jesus Christ ! Get up children ! It 's late . - Hurry up ! - Leave me alone ! You got into the water again ! Get out ! Hold that to put on our clothes . Hurry up ! You 're not allowed to watch . You 're a boy . You can watch . You 're a girl . Take off your wet swimsuits quickly ! You can 't watch either . - Traitor ! - Caught in the act ! We must find out whom he has contacts with , the nationality of the submarine , whom he has betrayed us to . Make it snappy ! Don 't shout ! Have you seen that ? Eh ? Hey you , what are you looking at ? Beat it , you scum ! Get lost ! Scram ! Don 't do that , my kind lady ! You fell on your face , doctor ! What were you looking for at the beach ? - I was looking for a tree . - A tree ? - Yes , for the dogs . - A tree in the middle of the sea ? This is impossible . We have to deal with this issue in a scientific way . I propose we establish a security service run by one of our own people . - By Polykarpos ? - No , brother ! I 've got my own man . - Is he a master of weapons ? - Of course , he is a hunter ! He 's got his own double-barrel shotgun . He shoots turtledoves , skylarks , woodcocks ... So we 're going to have game as dinner . I know that he sets snares ... traps for rabbits as well . Snares ! All over the place ! No one will ever come close . Is it all right ? Great . Bring the dogs inside and start up the car . We 're leaving . How the three musketeers became four ... Bring the snares inside later . There are rabbits around here ! Come in ! I 'll be back in a minute . - Doctor , I brought him here . - Whom , my child ? Oh , yes . The head of security staff . Splendid , Mr Thanassis ! This is my friend Haralambos . Pleased to meet you . Did Mr Thanassis explain everything to you ? - Yes , I did . - Great ! Great ! Well , Haralambos , you 'll set the snares all around and when someone is caught - I 'll shoot him in the head . No , Haralambos mate ! You 'll arrest him . Got scared , doctor ? He just wanted to show you . - I see . You want them alive . - Yes , alive . - What are we going to do with them ? - Do you want to know ? Come with me . Well ... We 'll lock them in this small room We 'll keep them until the first launch so they won 't speak to anyone . - Everyone ? - There will be no exception ! After the launch we 'll hand them in to the police and let them figure out who 's innocent and who 's guilty . - That 's right ! - How many do you want me to round up ? Come here Haralambos ... Who 's going to be the astronaut ? I can 't see any difficulty at all ! I 'm in total disagreement with Copernicus . - So you 're in disagreement , eh ? - Certainly . As you already know this question was originally raised by Euclid in the ancient times . - By Euclid ... - Exactly . We must never forget the pre-eminence of the straight line over the curve in the mathematical thought . - Look carefully here at the chart . - I do . Here 's Neptune and here 's Saturn . - And that 's Venus . - You see that ? - Of course , the white marks over here . - Exactly . Let 's assume we want to travel from Neptune to Saturn . It 's so simple . We follow the straight line . Look here . It 's so simple ! You set the route of your spaceship directly from Neptune to Saturn . You can 't but get there . Yes , of course . Fine but how could I know which star Saturn is ? But it 's the star right ahead of you ! - Did you understand ? - Yes , yes , sure ... I can hardly wait for the day of the launch when I 'll become the first astronaut ! The first Greek astronaut ! - No , doctor . It won 't be you . - Impossible ! Impossible ! It will be me and only me . I won 't let you expose yourself to such a danger . What will happen if a mistake occurs ? Who will draw the right conclusions so that mistake would never happen again ? Who 's going to carry on your work ? Alas , Mr Thanassis ! I can see you are right . You convinced me . You 'll be entrusted with the navigation of the first Greek interplanetary spacecraft . You put your life in danger in the service of science . - Oh not my life ! - Of course , my dear , My calculations , as you know , demonstrate that in the beginning the rate of accidents will rise ... up to 90 % ! - That means 90 % of ... boom ? - Exactly ! And I 'll be the first ? Only you had the courage and the faith to accept this honour ! And you will construct other rockets to carry on the missions after . Exactly . There will be other rockets . Who is going to make them ? - Eh , you 'll find another one . - Impossible ! You can 't go either , Mr Thanassis . Impossible ! Regrettably , we two are tasked by science with staying back here on old earth to organize and supervise new missions of other , luckier collaborators . - All right . - [ Polykarpos ] The dog is having a pee . We have to find the suitable person to charge with this mission . Hey ? What do you want me to do now ? - My God ! We found him . - Yes , it 's him , Polykarpos ! My congratulations , Polykarpos ! You 're so lucky , Polykarpos . My compliments . Thank you , thank you ! - OK , enough shaking for now ! - Fortune favours you scandalously ! Thousands of young people will gaze towards your face admiring the idol of a new technological era You are the agent of Greek nation 's ideals ! A new Greek civilization emerges with you of which you are the idol ! Once again , my warmest congratulations ! Mine too . Bravo ! Bravo ! So tell me now what have I become ? Idol ? Cyclitol ? Capitol ? - The first Greek astronaut ! - Oh ! Astronaut ? I don 't want to . - Hold it ! Where 're you going ? - I don 't want to . Imagine ! You 'll be first man on the moon ! And do what up there ? - Don 't you want to go up on the moon ? - On the moon ? No . Obstinate ! Don 't you feel ashamed ? Don 't you blush with shame ? The professor here charges you with one of the greatest missions and you turn him down . I 'll smash your head ! Why ? - So , the professor wants me ... - Of course , he does . - Can I speak you in private ? - What have you got to say ? Eh ? Come along ! Give me a moment . What do you want ? Speak ! If the professor wants it that much , then I 'll do it . - So you 'll do it now . - But on certain conditions ... Huh ! You have the face to lay down conditions ! Let 's hear them . First of all , you must guarantee that if I am to go , I shall at any rate come back . Is that all ? It 's 90 % OK ! You 'll come and go in a flash . That 's a deal ! All right . Now something else ... - I feel embarrassed ... - You shouldn 't be . There ! When I 'll be back , I want the " vizier " to give me his niece as a wife ... - What " vizier " ? - The professor , mate ! Things you hear ! And how come you know the niece of vizier ... err ... of professor ? Adrianne ? I love her . So that 's why you 've been visiting them . Wait for me to go telling him . Are you going to be late ? - Will you go to moon now ? - Now I will . - There he is ! - Where ? Don 't move ! Hands up ! Move forward . Excellent , Haralambos ! Get them inside ! Inside ! We didn 't steal anything , my good people ! We 're on our way to our farm . Silence ! Get inside ! - But they really look like villagers . - You don 't know these things , doctor . Let us do our job ! They may be camouflaged ! You must be right ... Get inside . Get inside ! Good Lord ! Basic astronaut training ... Brilliant ! 208 ! It 's too loose here . Does it fit you well at the waist ? - We 're OK in every other respect . - Absolutely so . - Did you fill the application form ? - What ? - Any particular comment , doctor ? - An exceptional outfit ! Mr Thanassis , you are amazing ! - Who needs the ready-made stuff ! - Splendid ! Polykarpos ? Polykarpos ! Don 't play with your buttons ! You need special lessons to learn how to use them . Now we 're going to inaugurate the special plan " CTFS " , that is cosmonaut 's training for spaceflight . Adaptation to zero-gravity environmental conditions ... - That 's right , gravity ! - First experiment : Five-minute trial under powerful streams . In the wardrobe ! I see . All right , take it off now . - I don 't want to ! - Don 't you ? Ready ! That 's enough . I 'm so satisfied with this test . He displayed great ability to endure air streams . He 's strong as a dogfish ! Come out ! - What 's coming next ? - The astronaut 's chair . Please , show the way to Polykarpos . Here , we 're going to watch astronaut 's reactions . Please , activate the chair . Isn 't it enough ? Halt it . So , is he going well ? - Stones ! - Stones ? - Kidney stones ... - That means he failed the tests . Let the next one in . Next , please ! - Next ? There 's no one next ! - I think , Mr Thanassis , that ... we must impose dietary restrictions , set out a scientific meal plan for him . Complete abstinence from meat , fish , proteins in general , fruits and pasta . - Can he drink water ? - A little . That 's what interests me . Hey , what are you doing there ? You thought it was easy to get to the moon ? So you wanted Adrianne , eh ? - Yes . I do love her . - Shut up now . But I love her ! What else now ? - Zero-gravity training . - Ah , of course . Again ? Show him how to do it , doctor , because I must go and see what 's happening . Come on , move your legs ! What 's all this , Haralambos ? Don 't you see they came for a swim ? Those two strayed away from their group of friends and came towards us . - Then they were hiding in the bushes . - What bushes ? What else could I do ? I suspected them No , Haralambos ! - Shall I let them go ? - No , it 's too late now . Get inside ! - What 's going on here , gentlemen ? - No arguments , please ! Just a call to the father of this girl and he 'll come to finish you off ! Let us take our clothes ! - Can 't even take our clothes ? - Later , later ! Get inside ! Get inside ! Get inside ! - Are they nuts ? - They 're evil spirits ! Get your hands off her or I 'll give you a slap in the face ! Cut this nonsense now ! We 've got to find how we 'll get out of here . That 's enough for today , Mr Thanassis . - Get down . - No , I like it up here . Come on , make it fast ! What 's coming next now ? - Antivertigo exercises now . - Oh I see . Come along . Move on . Here , together ! Not there ! - Climb up . - Where to ? - Up there on the platform . - There ? Mind you don 't fall asleep 'cause you 'll fall flat on the ground . The astronaut training goes on ... 3 parts of nitric acid . 4 parts of barbituric acid . Now the great secret ... One part of rosewater . Not from that side ! Not from that side ! Pull it through the other side ! Not from there ! - Not that way ! Through the other side ! - Get away ! That 's all we needed ! What do you want ? What 's your job outside ? Electrical engineer , graduate of Polytechnic school . How dare you speak ? Polytechnic , my foot ! You don 't know a thing ! Get lost ! Get lost ! And some mustard essential oil ... We 're coming increasingly closer to success ! - Hey ! - What is it ? - I 'm hungry . - You 're hungry ? There 's still half an hour . Then you 'll take the dogs out for a walk and the three of you will eat . Uh-oh ! They were hanging about here . Don 't you see they forage for wild greens ? They may be dressed in camouflage . Take them inside . Are you those who make the carnival floats ? What " carnival float " , Mrs Maria ? Two months have passed since Easter ! They are really making a carnival float . There it is ! Get inside ! Get inside ! Has this half an hour passed ? Not yet ! My good lad ? Do you perhaps need a whitewasher ? My husband is two months now out of work . His trousers were torn sitting on café 's chairs . I 've got three children , poor me ! So I go foraging for wild greens . Do you perhaps need a whitewasher to work for a few days ? No , auntie ! We 've got no jobs here but we 'll soon enough set out something that 'll create many jobs , even for your husband . Truly ! Very soon there will be jobs for everyone . Tormented Greece ! How long must you wait for happiness ? When shall we fill up our mouths with bread ? - We 'll send you word . - God bless you , my son ! Get down right now ! You lay down all the time ! Shall I take the dogs out and then have dinner ? You 're not going anywhere ! I 'll give you a lesson . Food is always on your mind ! Come to the chart quickly ! Are you still there ? - Can you see the stars ? - No . - Where are you staring at ? - At the ceiling . Here , these stars on the blackboard ! What 's this over there ? Attention ! Roadworks ! Choose another way . The roads are getting repaired . Choose another way . - Well , when Copernicus and Euclid ... - Who are they ? Why do you care ? Why care who Euclid is ? When ... Where are you going to ? Come back . Since there 's no reason to care ... Pay attention now . - If you keep on straight ahead ... - I rather have dinner instead ! You won 't escape . I 'll tell you everything some other time . I was right in saying that we 'll have game as dinner . Get back to the blackboard . Back to the blackboard ! The eve of Mourgos ' spaceflight ... This is Athens Radio Station . Our news broadcast goes on . Weather Forecast : The meteorological service announces that ... weather will range from bright and clear to partly cloudy in the next 24 hrs It will be more cloudy in the afternoon and evening hours . Sky will be covered by thick clouds during nighttime . In the early hours winds will be southerly , light and , later , will change into northwest and strong . Temperature unchanged with a small drop later on . Sea at the Saronic gulf will be calm ... In the rest of the country : Weather in Northern Greece will be cloudy with a chance of rain ... Shut up ! What 's new ? Is it going to rain tomorrow ? Locally , rains in the north . Good weather with a little bit of clouds ... A little bit ... Well , we 'll see tomorrow if it will rain . Mr Thanassis , in case of bad weather we 'll be forced to postpone the launch . Of course we will . It won 't be a problem . The rabbit 's ready ! You must be hungry , eh ? You must be very hungry ... - Very hungry ! - A double ration then . Last instructions ... My compliments , Haralambos ! At least , he knows how to cook a rabbit . Right , doctor ? Most delicious ! Well , doctor ... Can you tell us a last time what each one of us must do tomorrow ? Let 's recapitulate step by step and for each one individually the operation tomorrow . 5 : 00 pm ... Transfer of rocket to the launch site . Mourgos is boarding spaceship . - I 'm hungry ! - Departure of me and Thanassis to determined position in order to retrieve the capsule with the dog after the fall of the spaceship onto the sea . 9 : 00 pm : Launch of the rocket by pressing the launch button done by dearest Polykarpos . Special tasks of Haralambos Reconnaissance and surveillance over the area for security reasons . Did you get that ? At nine I press a button . All right ! I 'm sure you know your job . Haralambos is furthermore requested to prepare Mourgos ' meal that will be eaten during flight . Right ! Haralambos , you 're going to fry the lamb chops I brought inside . Before the launch you 'll put them in the capsule next to Mourgos . Don 't forget to wrap them with wax paper . Let us now retire to our beds . Tomorrow will be a very important day for drawing conclusions concerning the launch of our dear Polykarpos . Well , it didn 't rain the next day ... Come on , hand him over ! Carefully please , Mr Thanassis . Carefully ! Give me the lamb chops . Straight up ! That 's it ! At 9 sharp . Ah , we 've still got plenty of time ! - Don 't you have a watch ? - No , but I know , I know ... You don 't know a damn thing ! Get closer . My dear Polykarpos ! Oops ! No further ! It is 9 o ' clock . It is gone ! It is gone ! It doesn 't receive anything ! It doesn 't receive ! There it is ! It 's not this one ! We 've got to go back rightaway . My goodness ! Hurry up , doctor ! Polykarpos ! Hey ! What on earth are you doing there ? I 'm talking to you ! Answer me ! - Are you eating ? - Yes , I am . - Don 't , Thanassis ! Please ! - Let me be , doctor ! Reckless astronaut ! Don 't do it , Thanassis ! I brought another two . Don 't get disappointed ... I 'm hungry ! It 's done , doctor . The new rocket is ready . I added a few small accessories made by me so the negligible anomaly we had the other day won 't happen again . Your initiative is much appreciated and greatly moving . How 're things going here ? What 's new about fuels ? I found out the reason of failure during the launch of dog Mourgos . The percentage of the two basic ingredients in the mix was lower than necessary . Don 't spoil the recipe , doctor ! Don 't spoil the recipe ! Hunger is a bad advisor ... To arms ! Sound the alarm ! Who 's down there ? Saboteurs ! Spies ! Who 's there ? Why do they keep silent ? My God ! The captives will all run away ! Hurry up , doctor ! Move your legs ! - What 's happening , mates ? - Doctor , to the hosepipes ! Pour water any way you can ! - What were you doing in there ? - I 'm hungry ! What did you take it for ? A refrigerator ? It wasn 't me ! What a resemblance ! It 's the spitting image of its mum ! The grand day has come ! My dear friends ! The great moment has come when the first Greek astronaut , most beloved friend Polykarpos ... Excuse me , I 'm so moved . Doctor ! Benefactor ! Sage ! Don 't you be afraid ! If I won 't return , please take care of Adrianne . Come now ! Canned food for the trip . Squid . Grab that loaf of bread ! Ready ? Ready ! 7 , 6 ... 2 ... What 's this ? Polykarpos ! What are you doing here ? So I 'm back . Am I ? All right , doctor . We mustn 't complain . We at least found water . It 's all right ! We found water ! How are we going to use it ? We 'll plant vegetables . Melons , watermelons , aubergines , courgettes , tomatoes ! So do you agree ? Shall we plant vegetables ? The End

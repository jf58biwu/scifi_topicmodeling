OH , DO YOU TAKE IT BLACK ? YES . GOOD . YOU KNOW , YOU 'RE A PRETTY GOOD WORKER . WHY DID YOU GIVE UP RESEARCH AND TAKE TO MONEY LENDING ? I DON 'T LEND IT , I GIVE IT AWAY . A MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE BREAKFAST EVERY MORNING . HOW DO YOUR EGGS TASTE THEN ? FLAT . YOU DIDN 'T ANSWER MY QUESTION . WELL , I DID , IN A WAY . WHEN THE FOUNDATION PICKED ME FOR THE JOB , I DIDN 'T WANT IT , AND THEN I DID . WHY ? BECAUSE IT NEEDED SOMEBODY WHO CARED , SOMEBODY WHO WOULD SUPPORT SOME OF THE- - WELL , THE MORE UNTRAVELED PATHS . LIKE MINE ? JAMES , WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEE SO MUCH ? WELL , WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO ON BREATHING ? TO STAY ALIVE . IT 'S MUCH THE SAME THING WITH ME . I 'M CURIOUS , INTENSELY CURIOUS . NO , I MEAN THE PURPOSE . HOW CAN YOU USE YOUR NEW VISION ? OH , THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WAYS . YOU 'RE SITTING RIGHT ON TOP OF PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE RIGHT HERE . IN THIS HOSPITAL , THERE ARE PEOPLE I CAN HELP , HELP BY SEEING INSIDE THEM AS IF THEY WERE WINDOWS , BY SEEING THEIR SICKNESSES WITH A CLARITY THAT WOULD MAKE X-RAYS A TOOL FIT ONLY FOR WITCH DOCTORS . YOUR FOUNDATION DOESN 'T LIKE MY WORK , DOES IT ? THEY WANT YOU TO APPEAR BEFORE THEM THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW . I 'LL BE THERE . AND I 'LL BRING THEM MUCH MORE THAN A REPORT . NO , IT 'S TOO DANGEROUS ! THEN WHO 'S GOING TO TRY IT ? SOME STUDENT , SOME INTERN ? YES , OR BETTER YET , SOME CONVICTED MURDERER . ANYONE WHO HAS LESS TO LOSE THAN YOU . AND HOW ARE THEY GOING TO REPORT IT ? " MY EYES FEEL FUNNY . " " GEE , DOC , I 'VE GOT A HEADACHE . " THAT MONKEY DIED ! IT WAS A MONKEY , NOT A MAN . I TELL YOU NO ! YES !

XAVIER HAS BEEN UNCONSCIOUS SINCE YESTERDAY WHEN THIS EXPERIMENT TOOK PLACE . I 'VE BEEN ASKED BY DR. FAIRFAX TO SPEAK IN HIS BEHALF ABOUT THE CONTINUATION OF HIS RESEARCH FUNDS . NOW , YOU 'VE READ THE REPORTS , YOU 'VE HEARD THE TAPE OF DR. XAVIER 'S FIRST EXPERIMENT . I THINK , GENTLEMEN , YOU WILL AGREE THAT A FANTASTIC BREAKTHROUGH IS POSSIBLE . " UNBELIEVABLE " MIGHT BE A BETTER CHOICE . DR. XAVIER IS UNABLE TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF , BUT HIS WORK SPEAKS FOR HIM . IT CAN AND WILL BE REPEATED BY OTHERS BESIDES HIMSELF . IT IS UP TO THIS FOUNDATION TO FINANCE THE FURTHER WORK THAT IS NECESSARY . I MUST CONFESS TO YOU , DOCTOR , THAT , UH , I DON 'T BELIEVE IN A CONTINUANCE OF THIS WORK . I MEAN , WELL , THERE STILL IS NOTHING POSITIVE THAT HAS COME OUT OF IT . BUT , MR. BOYER- - I 'M VERY SORRY , DR.

 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . Blow the whistle FOR DANGER Conference room Hmm ... well ... What do you think teacher ? I am inclined to agree with the Lieutenant . Well , we know that the planet is virtually Floran a woodland planet . But new evidence says that there plant life disappeared . Full and complete hunger ? Exactly . And it is our duty to preserve life as much as possible on the planets . Yes . It is part of the Space Patrol code . Okay . Prepare to start the countdown , Lieutenant . XL5 part immediately . Stay the course 1-7-2-0 Black Code . Right . Code 1-7-2-0 black . Well , that 's it . We are on the way . Stay connected by Neutroni with XL5 open , Lieutenant . Si , Sr. I 'll take a nap . Things should be quiet . Lieutenant ! I have not touched anything . Just it happens . No excuses ! If not you , who ? Hello everybody . I should have guessed . Why I agreed to have him here in Space City ? I do not think he understands , Mr. He never understand . But that does not stop to continue doing . We are nearing the Floran planet now , Steve .

If it spreads through the ship , We 'll all be dead in a few hours . Soon . Let me put aside . How are the experiments ? I discovered traces of Planetoid 3 . Planetoid 3 ? Wow ! The dreaded disease of plants . All right , Steve . A meteor must have taken to Floran . This would remove plant life . I mean that nothing can grow here and the inhabitants They will starve to death , if that has not already happened . Now XL5 will take it to Earth . It is best to contact Space City Steve , and say to let the Decontamination Unit prepared . This is serious . - XL5 approaching , Sr. - Ok . Attention , decontamination unit . DECONTAMINATION UNIT Ok , they are all clean . Meter marking standard . Where 's Zero ? The Com . Is in the conference room He wants to see you Steve , right now . Obrigado , Dra Venus .

I will suggest that a Alvium pump is released na atmosfera de Floran . Claro , Alvium , hmm ... Precipitation should end the Planetoid disease . - That 's right . - But what human life ? If there is still someone there , as this will affect them ? Oh , that 's harmless to humans . Only affects plant life . Ok . So will Alvium pump . The XL5 is being prepared . We can leave when the warhead is loaded . Okay , gentlemen . Then XL5 part in two hours . - Takeoff A-Ok . - Understood . Er , Zoonie , now stop it . Good heavens , stop blowing this whistle .

A great surprise , let say , gentlemen . Well , I must say , for a planet with food shortages , you really have provided a wonderful meal . - How did you get ? - When the disease began , we create a stock of food . Serious enough for six months . But the bomb that launched wind up with disease and plant life will revive . You and your stories pumps that create life ! We know that these pumps only destroy . A clever trick , earthlings . Yes , a clever trick . But let 's not fall into it . You were drugged . - They were crazy , - . You are not crazy . Thinking they would get away with that .

How do you feel being a prisoner on the planet I wanted to achieve ? You do not understand ? We wanted to help them . Oh , no use . He did not believe me . They , er ... they left the radio Neutroni , Steve . This does not help us much but we can inform what happened to the Space City . Right . But will have to relay through the Robert no Controle Central . It is . Calling XL5 . Vamos Robert . Calling XL5 . Responda Robert . - Steve , the whistle . - What has ?

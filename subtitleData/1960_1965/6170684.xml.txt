 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Right . Come on . THE FIRE WARRIORS Ok , I get 2-X-4 , wait . Catfish jumpers ! Another fireball fell in Canada . A whole forest is on fire ! I wonder what is causing these fireballs , Commander . If I knew , Lieutenant , do anything to stop them . Yes , Mr. Sorry , Mr. Hey , that cloud that locate in space , sobre a atmosfera da Terra , You think you have to do with it ? I do not know . Scientists across the world are checking now . Yes , I received . Ok , continue aguardando , 2-X-4 Now Justice in Brazil has been reached . And it seems that cloud is the origin of the fire , Lieutenant . This is getting serious , Commander . They are falling all over the Earth . Ok , I got the position . Over and out . Aircraft crashes . Hit by fireball . Steve Zodiac is returning the Space Patrol , Commander . It is close to the space cloud . I know that Lieutenant . No need to tell me where my ships are . I was about to call the Fireball XL5 . Sim , Sr. Space City para Fireball XL5 . Colonel Zodiac answer . XL5 para Space City . What can I do for you , Comandante Zero ? There is a cloud drifting in space on the Earth 's atmosphere , Steve . - I want to analyze . - Yes , Mr. But what 's special about this cloud ? Gases are adrift in space forever . You know it . Why all now want to teach me my job ? According to scientists , this cloud is ignited when entering our atmosphere so really it 's raining fire . Okay , Commander . I will discuss this with Matt right now . Oh , that courage has this guy ! If he was not the best driver we have , I would fire . What do you think of this cloud , Matt ? Well , I tracked , Steve , But we can not look at it from this distance . We have to approach the Earth . Ok . I 'll increase our speed . It is ... As I thought . The cloud is a gas cluster , Steve . I will approach me . You can collect a sample . We are on fire . Tail section . What happened , Matt ? There is always some oxygen in the rocket exhaust , Steve . I think the gas found and bingo ! Caused the ignition . Shooting emergency retro-rockets . Take control , Robert . Keep fluctuation . Keep fluctuation . Check inside the tail section , Matt . Certo , Steve . Anyway the fire should not have reached the tanks would fuel or blown . Look , go for the jet and see what happened on the other side . Be careful , Steve and do not forget the oxygen pills . Ok . It 's almost over , Venus , Good job , Matt . I checked the computers . The fire did not cause more serious damage to the rockets . Steve seems to have controlled the fire as well . Well , that was close , personal . Luckily we mastered the fire before it caused more damage . Well , that proves our theory , Steve . Oxygen did the gas ignite . Let 's return to Earth , okay ? Since avoid that cloud , yes , but XL5 must undergo a review in Space City . Well , you have had experience with this fireball firsthand . Now , what is the answer ? Er ... it 's hard , Commander . If we can isolate all that cloud , atmosphere before it reaches a da Terra ... Yeah , I know what you mean , Steve . We could inject oxygen in it and burn it in space . But we would need a huge gas tank and do not have time to build . Venus está certa . So far only we had samples . What will happen if the entire cloud decide to approach ? The earth will turn a massive fire . I already know ! Hey , why not use our white elephant . You remember , Matt . That satellite giant that built here . You mean the Skyball 1 ? Of course ! It was designed to be a manned space station , but it became obsolete after built . Do not tell me that this still exists , Steve . It was built years ago . She was Commander Zero idea . As ia be , Commander ? - Still there ? - You know all about it , Zodiac . I lost a promotion because of this satellite . What do you think Matt ? We can use it ? Well , not long ago , Steve , but we must try . Ok . I 'll get her out of the deposit right now . But remember , Teacher , we only have two hours at most . That cloud will not wait for long . We think we will be here in the morning , Steve ? I hope sim , Venus . He did not have much time . But you know Matt , he works best under pressure . Well , now we 'll see . The whole thing should be mounted in space . With suction pumps and oxygen tanks in the control carrier . I think we can handle this cloud . I asked to space stations , reportassem that the cloud moves in space , Ten . Ninety . They must arrive every 10 minutes . What 's wrong with these antennas ? They are alive ! I think it 's time to get a new Neutroni receiver . Yes , Commander . Said the latest model , D-400 MK 10 is too much . I do not know how they expect me to control our ships with this outdated equipment . Ok , Venus , I see you in the morning . Okay , Steve . Bye . Welcome ! Hello everybody . Hello , Zoonie , then you 're awake . Hello everybody . Good . Can you help me to give a tidy . This place is a mess . Good evening . Zoonie ! Space Station Nine to Space City . Cloud headed for Earth . - Slowly . - Hear that , Lieutenant ? Yes , Mr. seems that we will have another wave of fires . We have an emergency on my hands and radio does not work ! Suffering spaceships ! The unit is on fire ! Delete these flames , Lieutenant , before any island will explode . Sim , Sr. Well , I guess now you need to have um D-400 MK10 , Comandante . Space City , Nine station here . A fireball is heading straight to you . Understood , Nove . Alerte Space City Tenente . E rápido ! Here is the Control of Space City . Emergency alert . Fireball heading to this island . Probable location of unknown impact . Venus ! She is alone . No use , Zoonie . I can not just sit here . I 'll call Steve and ask him to take me back to the Space city . Oh , I feel Zoonie but I am a member of the Space Patrol and the duty comes first . Commander ! The fireball is going directly to a casa de praia da Venus ! Let Zoonie . Let 's get out of here . We 're stuck Zoonie . The fire ... the fire is all around us . Venus ! Venus ! Oh , Steve . Steve , what happened ? Are you okay , Venus . I think you inhaled too much smoke . My house ! - My house , she is ... ? - I think that can be saved , Venus . I feel . Oh , Steve ! Steve , my beautiful house ! Calm , calm Venus , Do not worry . Let 's build a new house . Exactly the same as it was . Como está Venus , Steve ? Oh , she 's sleeping now , Commander . She had a big shock . How 's it going , Ninety ? Well , Professor Mattic is ending work with suction pumps and oxygen tanks , Colonel . Great Lieutenant . I checked the Fireball XL5 . The night shift should prepare you to take off in the morning . Tomorrow is a big day for me too . I promised myself one Neutroni D-400 MK10 . Great Commander . Now you may not need to repeat my messages in the future . Anyway , I 'll try to get some sleep . I think it 's better before I retire you By this comment . Lieutenant , you found three rockets ? Yes , Mr. They are ready in the release areas . The pre tank manufactured to the cloud is being loaded now . The launch will be at 0900 hours . You ... you sure you 're feeling well , Venus ? It was a shock what you had . I 'm fine , thank you , Professor . You know I really want to be with you this mission . Ok , Lieutenant . Send these rockets out of here . We have reports that this cloud is coming in droves para a atmosfera . Understood , Commander . Starting ten second countdown . Warrior 7 ... Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , zero . Ignition . Preparar Trooper 2 . Count five seconds . Five , four , three , two , zero . Ignition . Free for takeoff , Colonel Zodiac . Warrior 7 and Tropper 2 into space . Understood , Lieutenant . They should be ready in orbit until we leave here . Ok , Professor , prepare-se . We have a lot of work to do . Is fast . - That cloud do not delay . - All right , Steve . The two rockets in orbit . Keep XL5 afloat . I would not want to try to get this back on Earth . Oh , well , work . Preparing to connect remote pump suction , Matt . The cloud is approaching the ball . Suction pumps connected , Steve . It is working well . You did a great job with these bombs , Matt . The gas cloud is safe in the container , Professor . Bom . Ok , Steve . We detonate it now . Okay . Open the oxygen valve . We are out of the danger area . Open the valve now . Espere pelo Big Bang . What happened ? Why did not explode ? I do not know , Steve . The remote button was pressed . Perhaps a fuse has burned in one of the valves . This means that oxygen failed to ignite the gas . Steve ! The container is being drawn to Earth by gravity . If he enters the atmosphere , it will explode and the whole earth will turn into a fireball . I need to open these valves . The hand if necessary . But Steve ... Steve , that would be suicide . You can not do this , Steve . You never escape before the blow gas . Not Steve , do not do this . I need to do or the Earth will become a hell . Take Robert control and back up to the ball . Steve 're almost there , Venus . Matt was right . A fuse has blown . I need to call these valves and try to escape before they work . Oh , what Steve is doing , Matt ? Probably risking his neck , as usual . Well , there you go . I hope my total pressure jets hold out at once . This is my only chance , Matt ... Matt , Steve was caught by the explosion . Sorry about that , folks . I lost it for a minute . I 'm ... well now . XL5 para Space city , Responda Controle . Receiving you loud and clear , Zodiac . Doubly clear , I can tell . Hey , it was , Commander ? - Your Neutroni caught fire , right ? - Yes , Steve . But since you went to end that cloud , I have a new D-400 MK10 receiver installed . He is just great . Hey , Matt , I think the next six months , we will be sending Commander recadinhos through space . Sim Steve . He looks like a kid with a new toy . - Here 's Space City calling . - Listen . He started again . Space City chamando . Does anyone have any kind of report ? XL 19 ? XL 27 ? XL 30 , has some advise ? Please can someone say something ? Oh , what do you say about that ? Now I can hear them , nobody has anything to say . Translation - Neverlost

Even with the verification of Jack , I 'm glad to know that the Fireball XL5 It is following that freighter . Well , I am sure that there is no sign of sabotage in this freighter . As Edmund said , all checks resulted green . Now I go to my bed . CONTROLE CENTRAL The supply freighter never reach their destination . Edmundo is not as stupid as they think . CIA . REDEMPTION OF SPACE Hello Ed , please . - Let 's play another Joe - Okay . Everything is ready . The freighter will be fixed in space . But there is a problem . Steve Zodiac will escort the cargo to the Fireball XL5 . Ah , I thought he would make it . We will have to abandon everything . Not in this lifetime . Give me three cards , Joe . I will find a way to take care of this Steve Zodiac . Hello Jack , are you sure found the freighter ? Sim , Comandante Zero . I was the last to leave the ship and all readings gave green . All right , Jack . I just wanted to be sure . Ok Ten . Ninety start the countdown at any time . Launch least ten seconds . Spece City para Fireball XL5 . The count began , Steve . Right , Com . Zero . Ready to take off as soon as the ship is released . Okay , Steve , all set to take off . Understood , Commander . Well , so far so good . I wonder where our rescue boys are waiting . Somewhere along the way , I think . Okay , Joe , are stationary . Agora , resolver Steve Zodiac . Sim . But do you think he will be fooled by this recording ? Emergency . Emergency . We are on fire . We request help immediately . Zodiac can not ignore a call for help like this . It will change the course and anger toward where the recording comes . And will leave our shores . Well , all we have to do is put it in space , which will begin to transmit only for Cel . Zodiac . Sim , sim ... Emergency . Emergency . We are on fire . We are on fire . Requesting emergency rescue . We ejecting into space now . Hey , Matt , I 'm getting a signal . - Did you located ? - Yes , Steve . It seems to be coming in our industry . Position ... 24-OY We are the ship closer . We have to check . Fireball XL5 for Space city , received this cry for help ? I will alter the course and leave the supply freighter . Okay , Steve , I think we have no choice . He must have known something like this would happen . I do not understand , Steve . This is the exact position . But there is no ship signal . Well , wait , Matt . I see something ahead . Emergency . Emergency . - There it ? - Yes , Steve . It is ... This is very strange . It is a recorder , I should know . A farce . A dirty trick . I do not need three guesses to say who planned all this . Briggs made ready again . This requires a council of war . I feel like an idiot falling into a thing A false distress call . It 's the oldest trick there is . Do not blame yourself so much , Steve . You could not know . It seemed to be real . You 're right , Steve . We are dealing with a pretty smart bunch . But do not worry . Let 's get them . You can repeat this , Matt . Even if it 's the last thing I do , I 'll get them . And I think I know how . So you think you know how to solve it , Steve ? Well , let 's listen . It 's simple , Commander . First , I need to send another robot freighter and send Jack to his double check . Och , this is getting monotonous . Verification of the freighter indicates all ok again . I do not see how this is sabotage going on . ROBOT CONTROL As I imagined , Edmundo . CIA . REDEMPTION OF SPACE It looks like a overcraft . I think Edmundo finished his work on the next freighter . Ei , or ... Okay , get your hats boys . Go take a little trip . That 's great . Three mice in the trap . Drop us . You will not get anything out of it , Zodiac . We are not fools . We know the law . Yeah , that 's illegal . Why did I get myself into this ? Now stop squawking and listen to me . I will make them confess the sabotage of cargo the Space Patrol . And this little box of tricks will help me on this . Inside , my friends , is the bomb you planted . It is set to explode three hours after launch . The only thing that can stop it is the remote control you . I will be with him in Space city . If I hear the confession , desarmarei the pump and it does not explode . So it 's with you . You can not do it . You are bluffing . Stay here , boys and discover . Three hours after launch . Ohh , I do not like it . Ah , the track . Yeah , shut up . Zodiac is bluffing . He has nothing against us . I 'd like you to turn off this , Steve . We 'll find another way to get them . No commander . They are smart . They cover their tracks . This is the only type of game you know . My guess is that they are ready to deliver . See . The clock , we have only ten minutes . Oh , why do not you stop disturbing ? You need to be talking hours every second ? I already told you , did not I ? Zodiac está blefando . Yes , but suppose that is not ? They will not surrender , Steve . They think they 're bluffing . Now , turn that thing , We still have time . There remain eight minutes yet . Steve , I 'm worried . You 're taking a terrible risk . Como vai ser , Steve ? I do not think I will speak now . They will deliver , I guarantee you will deliver . Slim , they have only five minutes . Zodiac can only be bluffing . He can not blow us up . He 's not that kind of guy . They have to confess . I have to be right . Steve , turn that thing . This suspense is drives me crazy . Just two minutes , Commander . Oh , I do not like it . Slim , Slim , please , I can not take it anymore . But Zodiac is bluffing , I guarantee ! Tell him , Slim , tell him ! Vamos confesses . Confesses . Steve , Steve , por favor . This kind of thing does me no good . He 's not bluffing . Ok . You can turn off , Zodiac . We sabotage the freighter . We went . Hang up . Turn it off ! You won , Steve . You were right . Now turn off the pump . I can not , Commander . What do you mean , can not ? Steve 's right . I had no time to prepare the mechanism of the remote control . This trinket will work for at least 12 hours . Turn it off ! Turn it off ... See ? Steve Zodiac was bluffing . I said . I did not say , Joe ? Yeah , you said . But Edmundo told the whole universe we sabotage those freighters . It was your idea , put it in the coup . ... If you were with the free hand , would give a punch in the nose . - Is it ? - It is . Calem-se ! Listen to music . Translation - Neverlost

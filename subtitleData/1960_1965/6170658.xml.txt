Works ! I 'm listening . Now hang up . - Power off ? - Yes ! That 's something I had not thought . You can not find a way to stop this ? I er ... I 'm trying . - What can I do with that noise ? - I 'm tired of it . What 's going on ? Okay , Zoonie ! The Prof , do foolish things but that was too far . You can remember that here is the Patrol HQ and not a circus ? Sorry , Commander . Steve , until the night will be running . I do not care , Matt . In fact , I never wanted to see that . Let 's get moving . Everyone is sleeping now . This ... I take the tools . Is ... Coronel Zodiac ... Astronaut ... Space Patrol ... Hey ! An astronaut from Space Patrol ! Imagine what we would do if we had your identity . We could plan an attack . It 's ... We could also take a uniform Well thought out , Al .

Naa , only the main doors of the building , that 's all . - What was this ? - I have no idea ... Let 's just take care of it and get out of here . Hey ! What happened ? Commander is an emerg ... Not with his uniform . Good observer , Lieutenant . What is the emergency ? I 'm tracking a ship She 's doing to the planet Conva . The Prison Planet . The space prison . - My Identification papers were stolen . And my uniform ... But that 's not all . The deposit isotopes was attacked . They cleaned the place . Nave logo estará fora alcance do radar . Okay . Our birds flew , Steve , and we can do nothing about it . Fireball is ready . We can go after them . They are going to Conva , the prison planet . No problem there ? But we should not go there without talking to Gen. Shan . and be sure that he has the situation under control . Going there , could spoil their plans , Steve . Well , there is one thing we can do . - Well , say what it is . With Fireball ready , you let us take off ... Attention all units of the Space Patrol . Call of high priority . Dangerous criminals stole the Fireball XL5 . Intercept and destroy . Intercept and destroy . So this is the planet Conva . Better known as penal planet , Venus .

Mugsy for the boss of the gang . 45-0 Code Red . Okay , Matt , that is , Mugsy ... - Preparing to land . - I think the prof . He is enjoying . Yes , before I came he saw an old gangster movie . He really got into the role . The gravity Conva is so low , I think we can land the Fireball and Fireball Jr without separation . - Take off will be no problem . - Okay , Professor . Professor does not ! Mugsy ! Mugsy right , come on . Gee , it 's a long way to bottom . With this severity can fluctuate . Nor need the oxygen pills , It is filled with air to breathe . Steve , I can not stop ... Now you can . Put your hands up . You want to play hard , huh ? - If you feel very smart ... - Shut up ! Okay , Al , check the number . It is the XL5 yes .

I thought we were going to see the President . He lives here with his wife . He can not live away from things . This is where all the result of the theft is ? Yeah , but do not imagining things . I just think you need a bigger place than this when me and my gang started . And treat the boss and his wife with respect . They are more criminals than all of us . Of course they are . That 's why I have been chosen . Hey , go and find the boss Al . I will look for him . Look at all these things , Steve . That should be worth millions and millions of dollars . We have to try to recover it all back but how ? - This is the uniform Cmdte . - And my astronaut roles . Hey , hey , that every whisper is that ? Just admiring the view , that 's all . Hold them ! Space Spy ! Raise those hands . Now , what 's happening ? They are not criminals , Carmacie . This is the Cel . Steve Zodiac of Space Patrol . You dirty traitor ... Let me deal with it . I 'll show you what happens in Conva with people accused of being honest . - You said honest ? - They are honest yes ! And brave too . Nasty ! Ok guys , take them here . Do not worry Venus . We will escape this . I want to believe it ... Nothing could be worse than that . I 'll like it , Al . It is . They should be afraid if they know where they are going . I do not like it . What do you dislike ? Cel . Zodiac of Space Patrol come here . You old fool ! Can not you see that is the best that could have happened ? Er ... where are you going ? While caring for Zodiac and his friends , we give out with it all ! All set . No one can save it , Cel Zodiac What do you plan to do ? As soon as we leave this room , Shut up ! Soon they will discover . With this low gravity , let 's clean it up quickly . Stop chattering , we do not have all day . Why do not they just get on with it ? Easy now Venus . Do not lose hope . Ok , Al . Now . Listen . Do you hear that ? - It seems water . - I think that will flood this place . And we will drown ! Oh , Steve ! When we clean it here , we go to the ship .

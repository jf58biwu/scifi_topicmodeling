 COMMUNITY CHURCH THE END HAS COME Anther day to live trough . Better get started . THE LAST MAN ON EARTH DECEMBER , 1965 Is that all it has been since I inherited the world ? ? Only three years . It seems like a 100 million . 1968 - JENUARY - FEBRUARY MARCH - APRIL - MAY - JUNE Yeah , I own the world . An empty , death , silent world . More of them for the pit . Every day there are more of them . They live of the weak ones and leave them for the pit . K-O-K-W calling . Come in . K-O-K-W calling . I am on internacional frequency . Come in . They can 't bear to see their image . It repels them . I need more mirrors . And this garlic 's lost its pungency . There was a time , when eating was pleasurable . Now it bores me . Just fuel for survival . I 'll settle for coffee and orange juice this morning . But first there is my life to consider . I 'd better replace that garlic . I need more , lots more . Better stop off and get them . I can 't afford the luxury of anger . The anger can make me vulnerable . It can destroy my reason and reason is the only advantage I have over them . I 've got to find where they hide during the day . Uncover every one of them . Where did I finish off yesterday ? Madison street to 31st Avenue . Eleven kills , over three years . And there is more than half the city I haven 't searched . They are perfect . Just wide enough to keep the flesh apart , so that their body seal can 't function . How many more of these will I have to make , before they are all destroyed ? They want my blood . It 's their lifes or mine . I still get squeamish . Wait ! That garlic ! I better put it where it belongs . I can 't live a heartbeat away from hell and forget it . I am out of gas . That means one more stop I 'l have to make . I 'll get rid of them later . Right now , I am out of gas . It 's still fresh . But I 'll take only what I need . They 've got to last . They can wait , too . I 've got my life to worry about . Those mirrors have to be replaced before dark . Square blocks to search . How many of them still exist ? How long will I have to keep up this search ? I haven 't much time left . It 'll be dark in an hour . And now , twelve long hours before the Sun will rise , and drive them back to darkness . Morgan , come out ! Come out ! Morgan ! Come out ! Come out ! Robert , help me ! Help me ! Robert ! ... Another day ... Another day to start all over again . Virge . Virge ! God , how I miss you ! The Sun has already set ! They will be everywhere ! It 's Morgan ! Get him ! Do you hear ? Morgan ! Morgan ! Do you hear , Morgan ? Morgan ! Do you hear , Morgan ? Three years . Three years ! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven . Hey , Virge ? Virge ! Yes ? Oh , no . My make 'up . My hair ! - Hey , where ist everybody ? All I can see ... - Hi , Ben ! I can hear children , but I can 't see any children . Uncle Ben ! Uncle Ben ! Look , it 's uncle Ben ! Carefuly ! - What did you bring me ? - Open them and see . Open them and see . - Oh ! Come , come . - Are they all for Kathy ? Take a look at this . TELEGRAPH PLAGUE CLAIMES HUNDREDS Is Europes ' disease carried on the wind ? - Entirely theoretical , Ben . - Theoretical ? Do I have to remind you that the theory is the beginning of solution ? " Is Europes ' disease carried on the wind ? " Is it , Ben ? - Could be . - And if it is ? It isn 't , Virge . Is that what you really think , or just what you would like to think ? I cannot accept half-baked theories , that sell newspapers . I am a scientist , not an alarmist . You are whistling past the graveyard . Is that a commentary on my work at the lab ? - We both know how hard you 've worked . - I 'm sorry , Ben . I just can 't accept the idea of universal disease . Uncle Ben , you promised us card tricks ! All right , Kathy . Who can resist that face ? All right . Card tricks ! Card tricks ! Robert ... Is it possible that this germ or virus could be air-born ? Anything is possible , Virge . The best brains in the world have been running through this thing with a fine-toothed comb . The germ is visible under a microscope , but it is not like any bacilli I 've ever known . In what way ? It can 't be destroyed by any process , we have been able to uncover . But with the whole world trying , there must be a solution . Hey , Mommy , when 're we gonna cut the cake ? Right now , our problem is to cut that cake . - Hey , Mommy , hey , Mommy ! - Coming , coming ! Did the wind wake you up ? Always does . How do you feel ? - I am all right . - Oh , don 't get up , honey . - I 'm not sick , Bob . I 'll make your breakfast ... - You don 't have to . I 'll be all right . Go on and read your paper . All right . Oh , sweetheart , look , if you don 't feel well , please , go back to bed . I 'm just a little tired , that 's all . I wish someone would find the vaccine ! It 's all we are working on in that lab , Virge . Maybe you better not send her to the school today . All right . - You .. Do you think you should go to work ? - I have to . Bob ... Bob , I 'm so frightened ... Everything 's going to be all right , sweetheart . MERCER INSTITUTE OF C√çEMICAL RESEARCH - Well ? - The bacilli are multiplying . That kicks the bone marrow theory in the head . This specimen shows a higher white count , than when I put it down on the slide . Those cells are still living , Dr. Mercer , of one another . There has to be an answer . You 've heard that all comunications ended outside the continental limits ? Yes , I heard . That leaves it in our laps . So , we keep trying . Where is Cortman ? But he schould be here by now . You two stay on this virus theory , until I decide it 's exhausted . Right . - Yes , sir ? - Morgan will fill you in . All right , sir . And what did the great man of science have to say today ? - More of the usual ? - Always trying , Ben . Just like the rest of us . And nothing works . The streets are swarming with truckloads of bodies , that they 're throwing into that God-awful pit . And the dedicated Dr. Mercer goes on with this plodding , unimaginative approach . - You have a better idiea ? - Maybe . - At least , it involves imagination . - Ben , it 's as simple as this . An unknown germ is being blown arround the world . It 's highly contagious and it 's reached plague proportions . And you don 't belive some of the dead 've come back ? Let 's get to work . And why are they burning the bodies ? Why don 't they bury them ? Because it 's the best known way to control the contagion , to keep the germs from spreading . That 's we 've always believed , at any rate . - Do you prefer to believe in vampires ? - If they exist , yes ! There are stories been told , Bob . By people who are out of their minds with fear ! Maybe ... But they are to many , to be just coincidental . Stories about people who have died and ... have come back . They are stories , Ben ! Stories ! And why are the infected people always so tired in the daytime ? Why can 't they stand the sunlight ? Why are they only seen at night ? Come here . - Look . - I know as well as ... - Look ! - Now , is this bacilli , or isn 't it ? - It doesn 't alter ... And these bacilli are found in the blood of every infected person , isn 't it ? To show me germs is not to refute these stories , Bob . The point is , if there are vampires , they exist in spite of these germs . Come on , let 's get to work . And untill a further notice , this station will continue its arround-the-clock coverage of this national disaster . And now , we 'll switch you to the State Capitol , where His Excellency , the Governor , is speaking from the Executive Mansion . Further , I have in conjunction with the Federal Government , declared this state to be a disaster area . The public health is depending on the bodies of the deceased being burned . You must notify the Health Department immediately , if you have a plague victim in your home . Under no circumstance , should you gather publicly . In view of the dire emergency that exists , I intend to ... Anything new ? No , nothing new . Nothing . Mommy , where are you ? Mommy , I can 't see . - I 'm going to call the doctor . - I said no ! Virge , there is nonthing they can do . - But we can 't let her just lie there . - But this way she has a chance . If you call a doctor , he 'll report it . Do you want that ? Mommy , help me ! Mommy ! Mommy , help me ! Mommy , help me ! - How can you be so sure she ... ? - Blindness is one of the symptoms . You are not to call the doctor under any circumstances . No one is to come into this house . Now remember that . Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy , where are you ? I have got to pick Ben Cortman upon the way to the lab . No one is to come into this house ! Now remember that ! No ! No ! No , please ! Please don 't let him be buried in that pit ! Please , for God 's sake ! Don 't take him away like this . You can 't ! You can 't ! - Who 's there ? - It 's me , Ben . We 're late . Ben , what 's the matter with you ? Nothing . And I 'm going to keep it that way . - Ben ! Look , let 's talk about this . - There 's nothing to talk about . You think I 'm out of my mind ! You laughed at me and my theory ! You might be one of them ! Ben , look . You 're ill , You ought to see a doctor ! No doctors ! You take care of your life , I 'll take care of mine . Now , get away from here . You understand ? Get away from here ! If you 're looking for anybody but me , forget it . - Are they all gone ? - That 's right . Is there any hope from the latest reports ? No , not yet . But believe me , Morgan , we 'll find an answer . When , doctor ? We need it right now ! I need it ! You are the only one , who wasn 't afraid to come here today . What 's going to happen , Dr. Mercer ? Is everybody in the world going to die before someone find the answer ? No , I don 't think so . I don 't deny , that there 's a strange evolutionary process going on , but mankind won 't be destroyed . The fact that you and I are working here today is evidence of that . All right , let 's roll . When ? When ! I called the doctor . I had to . I told you not to call anyone ! Bob , she was blind ! She couldn 't see ! She kept reaching out her hands , and groping for me . Then , all of a sudden , she was gone . And they came and I tryed to stop them , but they took her . I saw a truck out there . Was that it ? Was 't it ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , lady . There 's nothing I can do . Let that truck trough . Get out of the way ! Get back , folks ! Nobody is allowed out there . Please , all of you . Get behind those lines ! Look sharp there . Move . Move along . Make way for that truck ! Make way ! AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Hey , you , mister ! Come back ! Come back ! Did this truck just come in from Market Street ? I said , did this truck just come in from Market Street ! But , Sir , I don 't know ! Hey , you don 't belong here . Get out ! - I said get out ! - I want my daughter ! Mister , there 're a lot of daughters in there , including my own . Bob ! Bob , I can 't see ! I can 't see ! Bob ! Verge ! Verge ... Oh , no ... No . I won 't let them put you there , Virge . I promise . I won 't let them put you there . Let me in . Let me in . Let me in . Let me in . Let me in . Let me in . Let me in . Who is it ? Who is there ? Robert ! Robert ! Robert ! Rooobeeeert ! Morgan . We 're going to kill you , Morgan . Morgan ! Do you hear ? Morgan ! Morgan ! Do you hear , Morgan ? Morgan ! Do you hear , Morgan ? If Cortman thinks he can get to me by destroying my car , his wit 's getting dull . This convertible would be nice . Probably handles well . But I can 't think of comforts now . There was a time when I shoped for a car . Now , I 'm looking for a hearse . This Station waggon would have to do . Alive ! It 's alive ! Wait ! Don 't run away ! Come back here ! Don 't run away ! Come back ! Come back here ! Wherever he is , I 've got to find him ! If I have to search every street , every house , every alley , every inch of this town , I 've got to find him ! Come back ! Hey , boy , where are you ? Where are you , pal ? Come here ! They are dead ! They 've been staked ! These are made of iron ! Not wood , like mine . Someone else has survived in this world . But where are they ? Where are they hiding ? How many are they ? Where do they come from ? Why haven 't I seen them ? This is Robert Morgan . If somebody can hear me , answer me . For God 's sake , answer me ! This is K-O-K-W calling . K-O-K-W calling ! Answer me ! So you finally decided to come back . Good boy . Oh , no . Don 't worry , boy . You 're going to be all right . Yes , you are . There now . We 've got all cleaned up , hm ? You 're gonna feel better . I 'll put you down here now and you can rest . You 've got all cleaned up . You know they 're out there , don 't you ? You poor driven thing . Everything 's gona be all right . Nobody 's gona hurt you . Everything 's gona be all right . All right . You 're going to get better . We 're going to have a lot of happy times together . You 'll see . Everything 's gona be fine . What 's the use ? Wait , I 'm not going to hurt you . Can 't you understand ? Wait ! Wait ! I 'm not going to hurt you . Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! I couldn 't be out here in the day light , if I were one of them . You know that they can 't come out until sundown . Do you want to come with me , or do you want to face them ? - You feeling better ? - Yes . - Would you like a cup of coffe ? - Thank you . - You seem very well organized here . - Yeah . My name is Ruth Collins . I was married . I lost my husband . You 're alone ? - You were married ? - Yes . Children ? A daughter . What are you doing ? Please , stop , please ! Stop it , please ! You 're making me sick ! Why do you turn away ? Why do you turn away ? - You are infected . - No . Infected systems are allergic to garlic . - You think I 'm one of them . - You will be . You made up your mind , just because I ... You can 't change the facts by talking . Facts ? What facts ? That I got sick ? I had a sensitive stomach all my life . I saw my husband killed . Torn to pieces , right in front of our house . I 've been wandering ever since . Hiding at night . Not eating more than scraps . Sick with mourning , sick with fear , unable to sleep . Then you shout at me . You chase me across the field , hit me , drag me to this house , and to top it all , when I get sick because you shove a piece of reeking garlic in my face , you tell me , I 'm infected . - Where are you going ? - Let me go ! You can 't go out there . It ist almost sunset ! - Let me go , I said ! - You can 't go out there now ! - In a few minutes , the streets will be full of them . - I don 't care . Let me go ! - I don 't care . - At least let me give you a blood test . Don 't touch me ! Don 't touch me ! Don 't touch me ! You must be hungry already , I 'll fix you some diner . - You know , you should eat . - I can 't . - You seem used to them . - Now , as much as anybody could be . I 'm not frightened of them anymore , if that 's what you mean . Oh , I protect myself against them , but only because they 're so many . Individually , they 're weak . Mentally incompetent , like animals after a long famine . If they weren 't , they should 've found a way of breaking in here a long time ago . Come out , Morgan . Hear that ? That 's Ben Cortman . - He was my friend . - Your friend ? He was like a kid brother . If I could find him an destroy him ... But you said he was your friend ! When I find him , I will drive a stake through him , just like all the others . But you lived trough all this . Do you know why ? Perhaps I was chosen . That 's a laugh . Or perhaps it 's because a long time ago , when I worked in Panama , I was bitten in my sllep by a bat . My theory is , that ... the bat had previously acquired the vampire germ . By the time it entered my blood it had been strained and weakened by the bat system . As a result , I have immunity . Well , it 's only a guess , but it 's all I gave to go on . You don 't think that I 'm immune , do you ? It 's a simple manner to find out if you are or not . What would you do , if I am infected ? Cure me ? You don 't have to answer . I know well , as you do , ... that it 's incurable . There might be a way . If not of killing the germ , at least of containing it , keeping it from spreading . If I had the equipment , and time ... . But you don 't . You are one of them ! I was . And without that injection , I 'll be one again . What do you mean ? - Did you find the solution ? - That 's right . Exactly as you said it could be . I take that for it . What is it ? Defibrinated blood plus vaccine . The blood feeds the germ , the vaccine keeps it isolated and prevents it from multiplying . We 've had it for some time now . " We " ? - " We " ? - There are quite a number of us . And I thought you were alone . I was going to cure you ! - Does that amuse you ? - No . Now , I want the truth . I want all of it . Why are you here ? To find out if you know any more than we do . You know far less . We 're alive ! Infected , yes , but alive ! We 're going to reorganize the society . We 'll do away with those wretched creatures , who are neither alive , nor dead . Start everything all over again ! And you want me to join ? You can 't join us ! You 're a monster to them . Why do you think I ran , when I saw you ? Even though I was assigned to spy on you . Because I was so terrified of what I 'd heard about you . You 're a legend in the city , living by day instead of night . Leaving , as evidence of your existence , bloodles corpses . Many of the people you destroyed were still alive ! Many of them were loved ones of the people in my group . I didn 't know ! - Is there any way you can get out of here ? - What do you mean ? They 're coming after you tonight . That 's why I was sent here . To prevent you from resisting them . I 'm suposed to keep you here , until they come . - To kill me ? - Yes . Your new society sounds charming . The beginning of any society is never charming or gentle . And you pretended to be shocked at my violence ! What are you waiting for ? Why don 't you go on and use it ? Get it over with ! Use it ! Get it over with ! Now , you know ... What are you going to do ? You are watching an episode of history of medicine-a direct blood transfusion . Obviosly , Ruth and Robert have compatible blood groups . - What are you doing ? - It 's already done . What ? Look . Look ! You see ? It worked , Ruth ! The antibodies in my blood worked ! My blood has saved you , Ruth ! Do you know what this mean ? You and I can save all the others ! We won 't be alone . We 'll never be alone again ! You 're sure ? Wait . Don 't be afraid . Where are you going ? I have to get out of here . To tell them you are no threat to us . - You can 't go out there . - You can save all of us ! When they come , there won 't be time for questions and answers ! They 'll come to kill ! For God 's sake , Robert , let me go ! Robert , please ! Ruth , look . Tomorrow . Please , Robert ! Tomorrow , Ruth . Tomorrow will be all rigt . Robert , no . - Robert ? - Yes , Ruth . - And what if it doesn 't last ? - But it will ! I 've already checked it under the microscope . Wait , I 'll show you . I 'll prove it to you . I 'll check it again . Ruth , just take a look at this . This will prove it to you . Ruth , there is no change . I 've double checked it ... Robert ! Ruth ! - Ruth ! - Robert ! Get away from her ! Ruth , are you all right ? Are you all right ? Run , Robert ! Robert , run ! Run ! They intend to kill you , Robert ! Run ! Run ! Up there ! There he is ! Wait , you don 't understand ! Wait ! Get him ! Get him ! Wait ! Surround the block ! Move ! Move ! This way . Hey , over here ! This way . Cover all sides ! ARMORY Stand back ! There he is ! In the church ! Over there ! Hold your fire ! Freaks ! All of you ! All of you 're freaks . Mutations . Hold it ! You 're freaks ! I 'm a man ! The last man ! Robert ! They were afraid of me . They were afraid of me ! They were afraid of me ! They didn 't know . Don 't cry . There 's nothing to cry about . We 're all safe now . All safe .

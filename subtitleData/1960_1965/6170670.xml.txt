 - Ok , Venus ? - Ok , Steve . Okay , come on . Only one of these capsules can immobilize whole system . abastece toda Space City . And when the Space City is immobilized , The earth will be ours . O terrestrial Steve Zodiac , all infidels , defeated ! SPACE CITY USINA NUCLEAR All very impressive , Matthew . More impressive is thinking that this small reactor abastece toda Space City . Yeah , but it would not be the same without Jock , my chief engineer . It caters to all efficiently . Oh , nonsense . It can work alone , Dr. Rootes . Of course this is all Greek to me . Just study Natural History . Now , now , now , Howard . Since I know , and this is longer than I can remember , you always come to this ridiculous story who does not understand anything mechanical . We are ready to test this new equipment Eject if you are , Steve . I wish Prof. Matic was here Where is he ? Showing all for an old friend , Dr. Rootes . Thank you for showing me everything , Jock . The elevator is already here , Howard . You 'll like Steve Zodiac . It 's what the boys call it ... Manda-Rain . Oooh , now I can keep my job . The teacher and his friend are rising , Cmte . Thanks , Jock . Dr. Rootes been away from Earth in the past decade , conducting some experiments with plants in space . What happened , Professor ? A , er ... power failure . Very often this happens , I must say ... No Space City , all worlds are virtually defenseless . That 's terrible The emergency system will be triggered at a time . That 's impossible . The emergency system does not work either . What happened to the emergency system ? It should be linked now . It will may have failed too ? - Very unlikely . - But not impossible ? No . It is not impossible nor in Space City . How long it will take , Professor ? I think you said you had an emergency system . I can not say what 's going wrong . Every minute that force is off , we completely defenseless . Hey , do not you think ... I do not know . No one yet knows . I think I 'll go down the emergency stairs and see what 's going on . After all . We are moving again . Okay , Jock . A radioactive delay capsule . Someone must have put it on the air intake . This deserves a thorough investigation . this could have been very serious . Eng . Head to Control . Eng . Head to Control . Comte . Zero aqui . Cmte I think we have a small case of sabotage in hand . Sabotage ? How ? A small delay radioactive capsule . Of course you know what that means a security investigation . Security alert . Space City close immediately . Fast , Steve . Space radar . Emergency ! A space missile . And he is heading directly for us . He must have approached during the power failure . This explains the sabotage . Trigger the red alarm . Connect all alarms . What is the possibility to intercept it ? XL9 in sector 26 is the closest . Let 's call it for the base ? There is no time . The missile will be in reach within hours . And XL5 is under review . - We 'll have to use the XL1 Alpha . - Is outdated , is not it ? It was not verified after the ejection test . It 's our only chance . We will only have time to put it on the ramp release in the morning . But we will have to work hard to achieve this . Launch Area Cmte informs that the systems are OK . Cmte the launch area , emergency services in Amber situation . XL1 in position . Prepare to remove the cables . Cmte the launch area for all sections XL1 in position . XL1 Alpha pronto para partir , Comandante . Phew ! We managed . The missile is in range . See , in the space computer . Ross is at the controls . He has a lot of experience . If anyone can do this is it . XL1 Alpha , intercepte o míssil planetônico . Position 14-0 Black . Interceptador , vá XL1 Alpha . Understood . All instruments OK ! All checked for departure . Full force . And good luck , Ross . Thank you , Steve . There he goes . - XL1 Alpha crashed on takeoff . - And Ross ? It all depends on the new experimental ejector equipment . Ross para Space City . I feel for the ship , but the new equipment ejector It worked perfectly . It is good to hear , Ross . Ross , let 's pick it up immediately . Missile approaching . Therefore , 1-0 . We can do nothing but wait for the explosion . We are lost . Quanto falta , Steve ? About 15 seconds , I would say . This is the end of the line . Venus , we ... we 're fine . The missile did not explode . Good thing did not explode . The computer indicates that it fell on the beach . Just a few miles from here . Let 's ... let 's take a look and see what it is . Whatever it was , it was not to be destroyed in any way . Of course , only made a cursory examination , but he seems to be completely harmless . In fact , totally useless . Where you came from ? Your opinion is as good as mine . I will make a more detailed examination in the morning . I suggest everyone go home and have a good night 's sleep . You 'll put someone guard the object , or missile , or whatever ? Yes , do not worry , Teacher , he will not go out running around . I do not want to see him sleepy in the morning . This is your alarm system saying that it 's time waking up to a new day . A happy day , I hope . This is the alarm system Space City wishing a good day . This is the alarm system Space City wishing a good day . Oh , come here Lazoon . We can talk a lot of an old alarm clock . At least we can turn it off . Fish spatial jumpers ! What the hell is that ? But this is fantastic ! The whole launching area is covered by this thing . Dr. Rootes , you specialize in natural history . What is all this vegetation ? Where did that come from ? Is Hedera helixa . An aggressive form of ivy , natural , I believe , do planeta Hedera . The plant planet . Yes , sir . A planet where plant life dominated all other life forms . But how does this get here ? He must have been in missile . But we look at the whole thing from top to bottom . There was nothing there . But they were not looking for very small seeds . You 're right , Doctor , do not look . Well , now what do we do ? I wanted to ask the same question . I think it 'll never get out of here . Venus , feel pretty . Do you often leave stranded girls no matagal , Coronel Zodiac ? Ho , ho , she will not let Steve forget this . We were going to send a Jetmovel for you , not going , Professor ? Oh , er ... sim . S-sim , é claro . Okay , I forgive you this time , silly . - Well , what do we do now ? - Dr. Rootes ? There is only one place where we will find hormones that destroy Hedera helix , and this place is the planet itself Hedera . And the faster the better , unless you want that the Earth is covered by this . But , as we shall there ? XL5 is covered with it . We just need to open our way to him . - He 's almost free . - You better get down there . Let 's throw them fast before re-grow again . It 's scary how it grows fast . It will not take much to cover the entire earth . Come on Dr. , go to the XL5 . I ? But I am a poor traveler . Do you really need me ? Dr. Roote without you , we are lost . Come on , I 'll give you some of my pills against space motion sickness . Keep firm . Oh heaven , oh heaven , I feel sick ... Now , come on Harold . Take another tablet against space motion sickness . Oh ... I 'm sorry . Pobre Dr. Rooter . It really is a bad traveler . Sim , Pobre Dr. Rooter . You know , it wont get sick even in an old jet plane . Now ... It should not be long now . There is mnha little beauty ? Yellow Course 1-6-1-0 . Yellow zero . Feeling better I hope , Howard ? Much better , thank you . Venus will serve us a delicious breakfast in a minute . Good heavens ! We 'll be there soon , Dr. Rootes . But you 're wrong , Steve Zodiac . We never arrive at Hedera . What ? Feeling bad again ? Let 's take another tablet for sickness . There 's nothing wrong with me . Nothing different anyone on board . You see , the XL5 is doomed . He 's right , Steve . See . Someone planted the Hedera helix on board . Yeah , and we have a good idea who did it . Está certo , Steve Zodiac . And you only have time to return to Earth to turn now . Not Dr. We will do what we came to do . And you 're going to help us . You , Howard ? I , er ... I can not believe it . It is clear that his years away from Earth They changed you . Entering the atmosphere of Hedera . Preparing to land . All OK systems . See , it looks like the Earth . Well it could be . It is an ideal place for vegetation . No clearing in sight . There is no place to land in Hedera . Or planet das plants . Magnificent plants ! In this case , I will land the XL5 the buoys and use the side rockets . And we have no time to be looking at things . Robert , take care of our doctor friend . Put me down ! Put me down ! Caring doctor friend . Caring doctor friend . Is this the place ? This is where the hormones are , yes . Come on . Well , where is , Doctor . We can not waste time . Here , Colonel Zodiac . I was expecting you . Colonel Zodiac , I can introduce you Chlorophon , the master of the vegetable world . The beautiful world of plants . Plants that dominate the universe and will make a wild and beautiful garden . And all because it 's my job . My work ! It 's very pretty , I must say . Yes but look Chlorophon , my creation . - Is unique . It is unique . Now I want to create some companions for him . That 's where you come in . I knew if he sent the herb to the earth , I could hardly resist the temptation to come up Hedera . You see , you are very curious . He 's crazy ! Stone Crazy ! That 's horrible . Not horrible , my dear Venus . You will be a beautiful Chlorophon . A single injection of amoclofophil formula and then ... But we must be careful not to give you a super dose . This could never happen . Now ... who will take the first dose ? Robert ! See , you can not use a hypodermic into a robot , Doctor . You never quite understand mechanics , Howard Rootes . Better get back to Earth where it will be treated . But do not forget those hormones . Do not know how herbs They developed on Earth . - Look at this ! - Fantastic ! Incredible ! Well , Matthew , that was a beautiful demonstration . Yes . I pity the poor Rootes . He used to be a nice guy in the Universal University . Well , I think he called the herbs very seriously . It seems that Dr. Rootes can not harm anyone . They are taking good care of him in hospital . But you know Steve , it 's not all bad . Because yesterday he sent me some beautiful flowers . You said flowers ? Look at this ! Fantastic ! This is where it all started . Translation - Neverlost

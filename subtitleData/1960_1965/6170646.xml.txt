Is that with exams and all , I ... You 're an idiot and a disgrace as spaceman ! How do you expect to become a Cadet Space if not even stay awake ? Exams ? Ha ! When I passed the practical design test , I took care to keep my eyes open and I spent in my exams with honors . But you need to be alert ! Marcando a bola ! have your eyes open for 60 minutes every hour . That 's what makes a good driver . But you 'll never be one , Well ? Sorry , Mr. Are these drawings I need to do for exams . Drawings ? Ha , ha ! Who ever heard of a space scanner that can predict the future ? This is not a retirement home for retired seers ! Get out of here and get some sleep . You are wasting my time . - But Mr. - Do not answer me , Ten . I gave you an order . Now get out of here ! Sorry Commander Zero , Mr. Out ! Scolding , scolding , scolding . That 's all I have achieved . Do you think he 'll understand . Things are tough for me now . Well , I guess I 'll go to my room trying to get some sleep . Boy , for a day , I wanted to be above the Commander Zero . Being a ... Being a General . Then I would show him how good it is to hear screams . Oh , all right . Wow , what a beautiful morning . The sun shining , I feel on top of the world . It 's the kind of day that only good things happen . It seems the postman calling . I do not believe that ! I just can not believe it ! And in recognition of his outstanding contribution to technical progress the Space Patrol , with its revolutionary radar design , to be used in the universe , You were immediately promoted to the rank of General Espacial !

The type of day when everything goes right . Wilbur ... You should have been at his post for an hour Ok my love , I 'm just finishing getting dressed . I bet the good Ten . Ninety is already working . Why can not you be alert and punctual like him ? Ha ! This is at first , then he falls asleep . Why can not you be like him ? Hum ... Tenente Ninety . I 'll tell you why I am not like him . It 's because they do not want to be like him , that 's why . You are crying , honey . I 'm not yelling . - Your breakfast is ready . - I do not want anything . I just want a cup of coffee . Now stop it and leave me alone . I do not know what 's going on with his father this morning , Jonathan . He is angry . Can I have his coffee , Mother ? He said he did not want . Yes , you can eat it . I have no time . I do not like leaving the Ten Ninety waiting . He has the ball . Why are you not like him ? Boy , he 's sour today . I did not want to be in the place of Lieutenant Ninety today . Good morning , Lieutenant . I mean , General Ninety Mr. just install your new radar component , Mr. Thanks , Jock . You did a good job . I think you worked at night , right ? Well , er ... Yes , Mr. It was a bit difficult . I would start vacation mines today . Vacation , huh ? And you deserve them , Jock . Oh , the rocket for Olympus summer camp left two hours ago . Yes , I lost it . Leave that to me . I 'll get you transportation . The best available . You 're a good man , Jock . A pride for the Space Patrol . Oh , it 's great to hear him say that , Mr. With your permission , I will take my luggage together . Sure , sure , light and not worry about anything . Got it . Now , where is the Commander Zero ? Mm ... late again . - Good morning Comandante Zero . - Humph ... We have a lot of work today , Lieutenant Ninety . These computers must be reprogrammed and synchronized . We can not accept any errors . Ninety Lieutenant , I 'm talking to you . You will not answer me ? I noticed that you 've been very lax in discipline . That is ... But ... but ... but ... In the future when addressing me , Commander , says the Lord . Speak , man ! I ... I ... I was just ... thinking out loud . Well , do not think man . Just do as heard . Let me think here . Bring Cel . Zodiac here fast . There is a mission for him to run . You want me to do what ? Now , I see Lieutenant , I mean , General ... Are you questioning my orders , Zodiac ? With respect Sir , I am not a taxi driver or an errand boy . I 'm an astronaut Patrol and the Fireball XL5 is a ship patrol , not a tour bus . Are you questioning my orders . I 'd be careful if I were you , Zodiac . Now just do as I said . Leve Jock para Olympus . And do it now ! Fireball XL5 fora da atmosfera da Terra , Sr. Zero understood , I assume now . Go for those computers and make full scan . - In double and flawless . - Yes , Mr. How about coffee , Venus ? The Gal . Ninety left me with a dry mouth . General Ninety para XL5 . Responda Zodiac . XL5 for Space city . What can I do for you , General ? You know the routine procedures , Zodiac ? You should inform the position every two hours . Why not do it ? Well , you know that we do not follow the manual to the letter , when we are in routine positions . If the manual says to report every two hours , then by Mars , you will do this . Is that clear , Colonel ? Yes Ninety General , Mr. Perfectly . We are not green 2-9-4-0 course , next to Olympus . Everything is running on schedule . Well , that 's better . Continue . Space City , cambio and out . Boy , promotion really went to his head What do you think of this guy , Matt ? It must be the 79th time he connects . I 'll be glad when this trip is over . General guiding in the back seat is driving me crazy . Space City para XL5 . Verification of scheduled position each two hours required , sir . But General , I have spoken what is our course . Watch your language , Zodiac . You are stepping out of line again . I will not stand it anymore . I think I 'll get a small defect on the radio . Mmm , this is strange . The Zodiac radio stopped working . It should be a technical failure . It sometimes happens . Maybe that magnetic field is interfering with the impulses . I do not need you to explain things , Zero . Continue your work . You 're talking a lot . Sim , Sr. Well , it 's time for space scanning . With this new radar apparatus have 90 minutes to anticipate danger warnings . It is satisfied it works , General ? That 's your problem , Zero . His ideas are outdated . Acknowledgment of the truth is one of the first things you need learn if you want a promotion . Red alert Zero ! Emergency ! Go there man ! Ask the identification of such ships . That ships , Sr ? Those ships , Zero ! Open your eyes , man ! Space City para todas as naves no Setor 23 . Identify yourself please . What is your mission ? No answer , Mr. I can hear it myself Zero . That 's what I thought ... Could not be sunspots ? I am saying that they are ships ! And hostile , too . The Earth is about to be invaded . Soe o alarme , Comandante . Emergency . Evacuate Space city . Empty launch ramps . All personnel report ace emergency stations . Zero , turn off these alarms . I do not hear my thoughts . Alert each ship patrol near Sector 23 . Let 's send a task force to sweep these invading space ships . Ok , I will notice . If this is what you want , General .

Hold on Jock . I will give maximum strength . Skip Jock ! I can not handle ! It is a quagmire . I 'm ... I 'm sinking Jock ... Jock ! Jock ! Can you hear me ? You are listening , Jock ? I think it will not take long . I will not have chance . Ohh , my poor head ! - Que tombo . - Jock ! Jock , get me out . The prophet 's beard ! Coronel Zodiac ! What am I going to do ? The jatomóvel . It has a rope . Secure the machine and give me the other end . Ok , Coronel . Colonel , here . Take . Ok Jock . Consegui . Get going Jock . Hurry up , I 'm sinking fast . Attackers are moving very quickly , Zero . Our patrols are at full speed . Soon come into action , Mr. He understood that the whole Earth is in mortal danger , Zero ? I want action now . Did you hear me ? Now ! Okay , Colonel Zodiac ? Ouch , you went through a bad experience . I think I 'm fine now , Jock . Oh and by the way , thank you . I think you saved my life . What 's wrong with these our patrol ships They insist that there are no unidentified ships in Sector 23 near the Earth . But attackers are there . I can see it ... Just like you , Zero . I think that 's what it seems . FOCUS Now see its fleet of invading ships , General . But , but ... It can not be ! Forgive me General , but it is . A meteorite belt . Absolutely harmless . But how ? What happened to the invaders ? Your new radar screen was out of focus , General He did that meteorites seemed spacecraft . Well , er ... You can learn something from it , Commander Nothing is perfect . Now , remember this . I will do , Mr. And what I say to the task force ? Make them return to their previous missions . This is what we must do , Commander . On the way home . I 'm saying , I 'm fine . Yes , yes , yes , I know that , Steve . Now rest . You went through a serious danger . XL29 for guidance , General , Mr. Oh , er ... yeah . What is wrong ? Well , sir , XL29 was the Earth 's path when you diverted ships to attack those meteorites . Tell the XL29 er ... back to Earth . But they have no more fuel , Mr. Freighter A-14 for control of Space City . Requesting landing and rest procedure . Wait , A-14 . I give rest to the freighter , Gal . Ninety ? Ah , yes , yes . They must land Area 1 E o XL29 , Sr ? Er ... what 's their problem ? You remember , sir ? Just say you are out of fuel . Oh , yeah , yeah . Well , um ... Well , um ... er them that day ... I suggest you wait until we send a tank , Sr ? That 's quick thinking , Zero . You are improving . Send a ship tank to them . Fireball XL5 for Space city . I request release landing . Oh ... Ok , Comandante Zero . I take care of XL5 . You take care of the ship tank . General understood . Waiting for ship tank George 971 Uh , answer XL5 . Then his radio went back to work , huh ? Pouso released . Area number 1 . Five seconds to start giving ship tank George , Four , three , two , one , Zero e partir . XL5 is heading for a landing area 1 . But it can not be , General ! Freighter A-14 is using that area ! Oh ... oh ... the tank is being released the same area . What do we do , Commander ? The show is yours , sir . You are the boss . They will ... They will all hit . Commander Zero , help me ! Help me ! Do something , Commander Zero . Help me . Help me ! They fell ! No ! Commander Zero ! What have I done ? Help me ! Commander Zero ! Help me ! Help me ! Please ! Help ! Help ! I 'm in bed , Oh ... A crazy nightmare . Oh , I ... I was ... I was dreaming . Steve ... and others ... They 're fine . Space City está Ok . All is well . It was all a dream . Oh , cara ! Gee is a beautiful morning . The sun is shining and I 'm a lieutenant who has idiots dreams . Oh , it was worth for something ... I now know what the Commander Zero think . I would hate to have that responsibility . What a beautiful day ! The type of day when everything goes right . Oh , my , I was too hard on the Ten . Ninety yesterday . He 's really a good guy . I 'll ... I 'll apologize . Yeah , that 's what I 'll do . He was right to scold me . Uh ... I think I 'll apologize to him . It 's ... it 's the least I can do . He has been working hard lately . I 'll tell you I 'm sorry . And then , Lieutenant , I want you to know I I 'm sorry for everything I said yesterday . Oh , but Mr. is right to scold me . I would like to apologize for my behavior yesterday . No , no , no , Lieutenant . Say no more . It was my fault . Uh ... I got heavy with you . Oh ... nem tanto , Comandante . You can stop interrupting me , Lieutenant ? If I said it was my fault , my fault , you know ? But it was not , Mr. with all due respect , I was the culprit . I 'm sorry , can you hear me ? I FEEL A LOT ! And that 's an order ! But I insist , Mr. You are in no position to insist on anything ! If I 'm sorry , I have the right to say that ! Well , I feel that you feel because I 'll make you feel so much , that will feel to be feeling . Translation - Neverlost

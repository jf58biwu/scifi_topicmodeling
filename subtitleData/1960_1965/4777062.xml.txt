 Scientific discoveries on the planet Venus are appalling and contradictory . Only the imagination is capable of seeing into its mysterious depths . And it may not be exactly as shown in our film . But trust firmly in the ability the Soviet public to explore this planet with self-sufficient spirit . Attention ! Moscow calling ! All radio stations of the Soviet Union broadcasting a TASS announcement . Three spaceships of a Soviet space expedition " Sirius " , " Vega " and " Capella " having travelled over 200 million kilometers are approaching Venus . The cosmonauts are healthy . To have come so far and to die near Venus We are still powerless against big meteorites . I can hardly believe it . I just talked to them . Earth calling ! " Sirius ! " , " Vega ! " We are shocked at " Capella 's " fate . We have faith in your courage . Enter the sputnik orbit . Investigate conditions on Venus . Communicate your execution plan . " Arcturus " will be ready to take off next week . It will journey four months . - Waiting is torture . - But you know the plan . One ship remains in orbit with fuel . Two land , for safety . No one can land until " Arcturus " arrives . Ships can 't land , what about people ? What do you mean ? One alternative is for " Vega 's " lander to land with Kern 's robot . To hell with the robot . Let me land in the lander . The lander doesn 't return . I know . I 'll work and wait for " Arcturus " . I 'll accomplish more than a hunk of steel . Someone 's got to see Venus with his own eyes . What if something happens to you ? I won 't yell for help . I 'll put that in writing . My life is my own . Mr. Kern ! - What ? - We have a problem . Wait a minute . Half a minute ! I can 't believe they 're gone . They were lucky . Instantaneous death . - Mr. Kern ! - You say well , sir . Alyosha wants to land in a lander . Why should " Vega 's " lander be used by someone from " Sirius " ? We understand each other . What 's it all about ? Nothing special ... Better to die usefully than wait for a meteorite to hit you or radiation disease to get you . - Earth won 't permit a landing . - It must . - We can 't wait for " Arcturus " . - Let 's figure it out . Without considering the danger . The risk factor ... Risk is standard behavior in space . - Figure it out with the help of your invention . - Okay . My electronic brain has been waiting for real work . Please do not joke at this time . 7 , 12 , 9 , ... Hello , John ! Wake up ! Yes , sir . Friend John , give us the best plan with landing with return with only " Vega " and " Sirius " present . There are seven of us now , including you . Ignore the danger factor . " Vega " remains in orbit with one man " Vega 's " lander lands three . " Sirius " lands three , making six in all . " Sirius " takes five back . The sixth remains on Venus . - Who remains ? - I do , sir being dead and the heaviest . Mathematics is pitiless . A rotten plan . A good plan , but dangerous . Who remains in orbit ? According to that plan I 'm the only one . No one else can process the information and transmit it to Earth . I 'd always hoped for something different . I worked so hard for so many years . Sputnik , then the moon . You know ! - I hoped we 'd be together . - What do you suggest ? I don 't know . Look , Masha the International Association insists on the robot . It will be a test for a whole trend in cosmonautics . - And I have to see Venus . - Don 't I have to ? Another world . We 've sent robots there , so many times in recent years . We 've studied the atmosphere , discovered oceans and continents measured the temperature . But the robots don 't tell us about the main thing . Is there life there ? Now man comes himself to find out to give an answer to this question . Get ready to drop a beacon . Surface pressure 2 and 3 . Cloud altitude 15 . Clouds of ashes above the coast . Another carbon dioxide center . A red glow can be seen through the clouds . Thousands of new facts and nothing about the main thing - - who lives there . - There is life here ? - There is none . Nothing living has yet appeared . Perhaps the red glow is a lighted city . It 's a dead planet . Intelligence has already destroyed itself . Who is right ? Robots can never replace man . " Sirius " ! Vershininin ! Yes ? I don 't see a landing strip for " Sirius " . - Yes , the terrain is difficult . - Shall we change the place ? No , the assignment is to land here . I have a suggestion . We don 't need " Arcturus " . From an altitude of 1 kilometer the lander will find you a landing strip . - What if it doesn 't ? - They 'll put up statues to us . Who 'll be the lander crew ? Kern , the robot , and myself . Masha will remain in orbit . We 'll leave the robot on Venus . - You 've got it all figured out . - Long ago . What shall we say ? I wish I were with them . It 's reckless ! Prepare a well-substantiated report for headquarters . ... Perhaps we 'll get permission . - Ready ? - Yes . Go ! I envy you , Shcherba ... You too , Allan Kern ... I understand you , Captain . - Good luck ! - Bon voyage , my friends . Goodbye . They 're approaching . Storm clouds ... Lightning . We 're turning the controls over to John . A sheer cliff ahead . I 'm climbing . Oh , excellent . It 's amazing ! The ground is covered by thick clouds . We 're using the locator . It 's bad so far . Here ! A flat strip in a hollow . Hard ground ... Good for landing . We 're dropping the beacon . Land in quadrant 73 . We 're being carried away . There 's water below We 'll land in a swamp . Projecting rocks . Chances of destruction 90 percent . I 'm landing . Ilyia Vassilievych ? Masha , do not worry . They 've landed . We got an image on the screen . We 'll contact them at the next orbit . Shcherba ! Hello ? Kern , hello ? Shcherba , Kern , hello ? It looks bad . Get ready . We 'll land now . It 's calmer at night . Quadrant 73 . - Masha ? - Yes , I 'm here . Masha , we 're going to land . You 're remaining all alone in space . Masha , dear ! Watch us with the locator . You know what to do . - And remember the instructions . - I know ... Look , Masha ... If we lose our lives keep yourself together . - I understand . May I cut the connection now ? - You may , my dear . It 's hardest for the one who 's alone . - Earth ! - Flight headquarters permits you to land at any time . Do not risk lives . We wish you luck . The whole country is with you . Earth ! Headquarters ! We 're landing as planned . Quadrant 73 chosen by lander . We assure the Soviet government , the Party , and the people that we 'll do all we can to justify their trust in us . If anything goes wrong , help Masha . She 's alone . Ilya , it 's time . I 'm removing the antenna . Switching on the autopilot . Quadrant 73 . Direct course by beacon . We have arrived on Venus ! Quadrant 73 . - What a strong downward pull ! - Not used to it . The ground is level . Our scouts chose well . Good landing . We 're stable ! Feels like the Earth . I 'm lifting the shades . Give us some light , Roman . A dense fog . Let 's look around with the locator . There 's a cliff 200 meters away and some sort of protuberance here more rocks . - I 'll switch on the outside microphones . - Okay . - Hear that ? - Yes . - What is it ? - Be quiet . Let 's not lose time . Roman , use the infrared viewer and locators . Then we 'll transmit to Earth . Turn on the weather station , the bio-detector , and also the seismograph . Do everything according to Plan 1 . - When Masha appears above the horizon , inform her we 've landed . - Oh , I 'll boast ! We 'll boast when we 've rescued the others . - Do we start at dawn ? - Yes , at 6 a.m. I 'm standing ! May I walk a few steps ? - Careful , feel your way . - Sure . An ordinary stone ... ordinary water ... I can hardly believe it . Alyosha , turn back . Just a moment . Oh ! Ilya Vassilievich ! Masha found the lander . - Are they alive ? - She located two metal objects . One is moving ... the robot , probably . - No word ? - The radio may have broken . Alyosha ! - Get up ! - I can 't break free ! Courage ! - Alive ? - Alive ! The spacesuit is intact . I 'll photograph it . There 's life here . That 's the important thing . You 're in too much of a hurry . We arrived just in time . - How 'd you find out ? - We heard a voice . - So did I. - Strange ! Anything 's possible on Venus . - What else did Masha say ? - What else should I say ? I was so worried about you all . I 'm so happy . I sang songs and then I flew about the cabin . I took off my magnetized shoes and flew . Masha , we 'd like the information . Sorry I lost my head . They 're in the quadrant beyond the red glow . That 's 32 kilometers away from you across the gulf . Is that clear ? - Get the cross-country car ready . - That 's a long distance for it . What do you suggest then ? Not to land on Venus in landers . Are they alive ? Masha ! Masha , couldn 't the robot have begun to move by itself ? No . I understand you . It could not have . It wasn 't assembled . They assembled it there . Stop ! Okay . Imps of the devil ! - Quickly ! - Hold on another minute . That was some blow , John . Okay ! Course 110 . Stay on the cliff . Stretch a cable across . - Execute the orders . - Yes , sir . Ordinary men cannot conquer these wild planets . - Men of steel are better suited . - A small tank would be more practical . But a robot is much better . You go first . I 'll help . - Shall we stop ? - Yes , let 's look around . Ilya Vassilievych , look - there 's another one . - It looks like a brontosaurus . - I 'll get a blood sample . - Take it from the tail . Got it ? - Don 't worry ! Careful ! And measure his temperature ! He 's only just realized ! What did Masha say ? The robot is moving towards us , but slowly . Don 't hurry . There 's oxygen for only 24 hours . They must be looking for us . Coming this way . Through this hell ? No ! People are cowardly and selfish . People know friendship . We 're sick . I have a fever . Infection has got in . We 've torn our suits badly . - Let 's take some quinocillin . - No , we 've no time to rest afterwards as prescribed . It will pass . Come on ! How far is it to the other shore ? 10 kilometers across the gulf , 70 around it . I 'll cross this beautiful lake . - Listen . - Let 's put down . The same voice as before . A squid of some sort . There are plenty of beasts around . What is that noise ? - It 's a voice . - A woman , perhaps ? You wish . - Remember Darwin ! - I don 't understand what this has to do with Darwin . How can Man appear in the dinosaur period ? We 're here . We flew here ! Ivan , Alyosha 's right . Man is a space flyer so we can traverse time . - You cannot ! - Of course ! Darwin theory applies to Man 's evolution and not to his distribution among the planets . That 's in Tsiolkovsky 's field . I wonder why they keep you in the Academy of Sciences . We 're the first arrivals from Earth . But there may have been others before us . - Who knows ? - Okay . Come on ! There 's too much water from above . My mechanism is in danger . I need shelter . Alright , John , look for a cave . Yes , sir . - I can 't stand it anymore ! - Buck up ! We can 't stop here . We 'll be washed away . Come on , come on . Hold on . Just a little longer ... Courage ! Do not give up ! John ! Yes , sir . I 'm in a cave . Brightness 3.2 lux . You 're a fine mathematician , John . I feel I 'm losing my mind . According to the laws of mathematics peace will reign in the world . But what can we do to get out of here ? The kingdom of peace , the kingdom of profit , the realm of science . No , Masha , they won 't miss us . They will never find us . - " Sirius " ... - You can reach " Sirius " by car in 37.2 minutes over a paved road . - Ilya ? - Yes ? Bad news from Masha . The robot 's disappeared . That 's worrying . Look for them . Maybe we 'll hear their helmet radios . - There should be close . - I 'll try . I got them . It 's the robot . He 's talking nonsense . Listen ! ... the cost of building a road to " Sirius " at Smith Co prices will be 57 million rubles . - The robot is out of control . - I 'll try to contact them . Hello ! Hello , Iron John , whatever . Can you hear me ? - The devil 's doll doesn 't answer . - The robot reacts only if politely addressed . What a delicate one . Hello . Dear John , please reply to us . Audibility 46.5 % . Where are your masters ? Where 's Kern ? Where 's Shcherba ? No masters . Slavery is prohibited by the Constitution . I 'm a free , thinking machine . Describe your companions position . Horizontal position . - Where are you ? - Beneath a stone archway . - They 're in a cave . - That 's why Masha couldn 't locate them . Hello , John what are your companions discussing ? About Masha , about world government of which I 'll be Prime Minister . - They 're delirious . - It 's a fever . - Perhaps a rip in their spacesuits . - We must act now . Take the controls . - Yes . Hello , listen carefully , John ! Take the quinocillin from the medical kit ... Quinocillin - - tube number 2 . 9 : 15 . Transmitted all data collected by " Sirius " to Earth . 1 : 30 . Passed over car . They were crossing the sea . Something is flying towards us on the right . - What do you think ? - Changing form , rather solid . Fairly compact . Look ! - Looks like a pterodactyl ! - Pull down your helmets ! It 's dangerous . Don 't mess with this monster . - It 's beautiful beast ! - Devil ! - Did you get a photograph ? - Yes . - Then fire the gun . - The mechanism 's jammed . Open the hatch and fire it manually . A flying animal is attacking . Nice shot ! Transmit to Earth . Hello . What happened ? Hello ? What shall I transmit ? - It 's invulnerable . - Let 's submerge . All right . They 've disappeared ! The car 's not designed for underwater . It 's the end for them . What went wrong ? If their spacesuits are intact , they 'll get out . What if they 're hurt ? I have to help them . But if I land we won 't be able to return to Earth . Still , I must land . I can land on the next orbit . In an hour I will light the engines . A whole hour to wait ! I must think it out . The Earth ... Millions of people worked making a pyramid to the heavens of their work . They placed us on the summit , trusted us . Now everything depends on me alone . And I don 't know what to do . The instructions forbid leaving orbit . If I land , return to Earth will be impossible . But why save fuel up here while they are dying ? The instructions could not foresee everything . My instinct tells me they need me down on the planet . I must inform the Earth . How difficult it is to speak calmly . Let them listen to my last recording . The instructions couldn 't foresee everything ... My heart tells me they need me there on the planet . Hello , " Vega " ! Masha Ivanova ! Earth is with you . Stay calm . Do not leave orbit . All will be lost ! Have courage ! Earth asks you . Your Earth ! My ... Earth ! Remain in orbit , or all will be lost . What should I do ? Time is nearly up . I must decide . And I ... I cannot ! It was easier to sink the car than to pull it through the water . Yes , the current is strong . Let 's rest for a little while . Interesting rocks . I 'll take a look . They are like our fish . Conditions resemble ours . Surely , nature could not have arranged these rocks it looks like a road . What if it is a sunken city ? Gave me a fright ! An entrance ? Interesting ! I hope the tenants are out . What a strange stone . Triangular . I 'll take it along . Look at this ! - What is it ? - A petrified dragon . Perhaps it 's carved into the rock ? Sculpted ? What are you saying ? Look ! It 's a glass eye ! It 's a ruby ! Put in by intelligent beings . Let 's go back to the surface . Give me the buoy . What is the result , professor ? It 's volcanic porous iron . It is oxidizing and ... - ... taking oxygen from the air . - So what ? Man could extract his oxygen from this . Want to start colonizing and earn the Nobel Prize ? One can work for mankind without prizes . This will be our vital oxygen . Ready , sir . John , play our favorite song . Our favorite ! - Ilya ! - Yes ? We 'll have to wait until the car dries . Patience , wait . Ilya , that dragon with the ruby eye is made crudely ... - ... by a savage , perhaps . - Very likely . But savages couldn 't have flown to Venus . Why not ? Bobrov flew here . Stop . Savages couldn 't have flown here but they could have developed here . - How is it possible ? - Imagine for a moment suppose intelligent beings had flown here and remained for some unknown reason ... - ... and lost contact with their own planet . - They would be dead supplies exhausted . In an alien atmosphere and conditions , ... - ... they would perish . - Some would survive but go native over time in the brutal fight for survival and adjustment to local conditions . Thus began the decline of civilization . Only the strong would survive . - And savages would appear among the dinosaurs . - Exactly . Before the local apes , the future masters of the planet , began to evolve . - Again ? - Sounds like a warning . We 're near the red glow . - Is the gun in order ? - Yes . What a mysterious world . A sunken city , and that ruby and that voice . Who could have flown here before us ? The inhabitants of another planetary system , perhaps ? Or maybe the Martians ? On Mars , we must fight for every drop of water . Here there is water everywhere . Maybe they tried to migrate from Mars , but failed and went native and now are advancing to civilization for the second time . Perhaps Martians once came to Earth and we modern people ... We can go now ! I will find them ! - It 's getting dark early . - No wonder . - Why ? - There 's a cloud of ash over us . A cloud of ash ? - A volcanic eruption ! - Yes . So that 's the glow . Your lighted " city " ! - Rather inconvenient . - On the contrary ! We can get samples of the lava and ashes . - Is the spectroscope in order ? - Yes . We must look for a more elevated location away from here . Shcherba , let 's go ! A pity to leave this magnificent spectacle . - Mister Shcherba ! - Yes ? The lava is encircling us . - Did you get a spectrum ? - Yes . - From the crater edge ? - No . - Why ? - No , it was too late . - John ! - Yes , sir . - Take us across the river of lava . - Mount up , quickly ! - Audibility is improving . - What 's he got there ? - Be quiet . - I hear radio contact I am giving our location as instructed . The distance is 2 miles . - It 's our men ! - Sure , who else would it be ? And you didn 't want to believe me . - Your machine is splendid . - Yes ? - It is . - At last , you admit it . The temperature has reached 500 degrees . Further movement while burdened endangers my mechanism . - What will we do ? - Disable the self-protection . - Where ? - Open the door , panel 5 . Break the wire ! - I don 't know which one . - Let me do it . - I can 't see from here . - I have to get rid of your weight . Damned fool ! - He 'll throw them into the lava ! - Quick ! Leave us off here . - Okay , Kern ? - Hello , Kern ! It is better to be a robot , or flesh and blood ? Both are needed , evidently . - That 's better . - Maybe . Come on . How 's the radio ? - Where 's Masha ? - Passing the zenith . Nothing from the radio . Why are they numbered ? We hadn 't named them yet . - I was hoping for one and instead there were three . - Daughters ? - Sons ! - A complete crew ! Do you think intelligent beings visited Earth millions of years ago ? There is no evidence of it . Many of history 's mysteries could be evidence . The Stone Age drawing ... - ... on a cliff in the Sahara Desert . - That 's right . It shows a man wearing something like a spacesuit . And the ancient iron column found in India . The iron it is made of was made by a method unknown on Earth . And the secret of Atlantis . And the famous discoveries of ancient Egyptian astronomers ? - What other evidence do you want ? - None of that is evidence . There is evidence in legends . The descent of the gods from heaven , for instance . - It 's not ! - Why not ? How would a native here draw us ? Perhaps as saints with halos and say that a god had descended from the sky , a god with leather skin . - And there 's your local legend . - With illustrations ! Space flights are an inevitable stage of development of life in the cosmos . Worlds are not isolated . The migration of life in space is as natural as seeds swept by the wind on Earth . And branches of a single tribe of living beings are developing in the solar system . The people of the Sun . Then intelligent beings must be related . Ah , to see the women of the other planets what are they like ? Everything would become clear . So learn to dream ! Planet of Storms , thanks for all that you taught us . Thank you for accommodating us . Here is our tribute to you . Our ship is waiting to return us home . Our hearts beat to return . Home , Friends ! We go home with courage in our hearts . Marshes , fields and woods ahead . In our beloved country , our homeland , our land ! - Your squid is happy you 're safe and sound . - Do not joke . - She is good and beautiful . - Tomorrow we 'll try to catch her . You 're obsessed ! If she 's a Martian gone native , where are the others ? And if you landed in some remote corner of the Earth ... - ... you wouldn 't meet anyone in two days . - Yes you would . The rest would be there , behind the mountains . And the telephone hasn 't been invented here yet . Here we are . We 've carried out our mission . Look at all this data ! You take the most valuable : the plates and microsamples . The stones go to the geologist . - Alyosha ! - Yes ? - Let 's go to the radio . - At your service . - Vershinin , quick ! - What is it ? Quickly ! A recording of Masha 's transmission from " Vega " . Perhaps " Sirius " will receive this transmission . The orders require me to remain in orbit , that I wait and do nothing , while my friends may be in mortal danger . I 'm violating the orders . I am landing on Venus . All is ready . I 'll fire the engine in one minute . - How could she ? - She didn 't think . A robot can think , not a woman . May God forgive her ! - She 's not in orbit . - She must be . - Hello , " Vega " ! - " Vega " could have crashed or sunk . - We 'd better inform Earth . - Our only contact with Earth was through " Vega " . Friends ! I propose that Shcherba Kern and Alyosha remain here and encamp . Roman and I will go into orbit find " Vega " and give you the coordinates ... - ... transmit out findings to Earth and summon " Arcturus " . - Okay . - Unload the camping gear . - We 've got to lighten " Sirius " anyway . What was that ? - An earthquake ? - The rocket has shifted . The bluff is eroding . The lake has broken through . Look , a fissure ! If " Sirius " collapses we 're finished . Quickly , prepare for takeoff . Maybe we 'll make it . The radio must be here . Roman , when was Masha 's last transmission recorded ? At 7 : 20 . Why ? The locator recorded the " Vega " passing after that . - What ? - She has not landed ! - First , Masha , are you okay ? - Masha , what happened ? I realized I was making a mistake . I aborted the engine but the orbit has changed . Then I located you near the red glow . I called , but you didn 't answer . - Now they needn 't stay behind . - Correct . Hello ! Give us the new orbit . Quickly ! Hello ! All aboard . - Who knows why . - Ivan , are you alive ? Masha ! - Alyosha , activate the weather station . - Now . Alyosha , hurry ! Ilyia Vassilievych ! Wait ! We can 't leave ! Look ! They 're like us ! Understand ? Look ! They resemble us ! Do you understand ? Wait ! Where are you pulling me ? I 'm telling you that they 're like us . " Planet of Storms " , till me meet again . Our ships will return to you . For we are the sons of the Earth . We are the sons of the Earth !

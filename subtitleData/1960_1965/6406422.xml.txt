 DR. VON STEINER : Power input , computers , tapes , all a go . Laser beam cycling , normal , cryogenic systems , go . Cathodes at 67,000 volts and steady . Time selector set at present . All set , Al , standby for time synchronization . AL : Standing by . Date , 5 July , ' 64 . Time , 11 hours , 14 minutes . Counting . Five , four , three , two , one . - Mark . - AL : Mark . Lights . Standby to activate image stabilizer switch . Ready . DR. VON STEINER : Switch on . Switch on . STEVE : Reception , 100 . All systems go . DR. VON STEINER : Time selector accuracy , 100 . STEVE : Here we go , Al . AL : Okay . See you day before yesterday . DR. VON STEINER : Setting the time selector back 24 hours . STEVE : All go . CAROL : All go . DR. VON STEINER : Accuracy , 100 . I 'm setting the time selector back 48 hours . AL : sure . STEVE : Standby . Setting , minus one . ( VOLTAGE FLUCTUATING ) DANNY : Hi , doc . Hello , Steve . - Uh , Carol . - Huh ? Oh , hi , Danny . Look , I know you 're all busy , But they sent me down from the front office . I had to tell them about those extra power cables I got for doc And I got chewed out but good . Gee , Danny , I 'm sorry . We certainly didn 't mean to get you in trouble . Oh , no , that 's okay . I don 't mind that . Anyway , what do they know ? Only you see , I ... Oh , Danny , could you wait just a minute ? This check run won 't take long . Yeah , but I 'm supposed to ... ( BUZZING ) The power . Oh , nuts . Go ahead , you guys . At present , the circuits check . Okay , then . What are we waiting for ? Phase two . Phase two it is . I 'll set the time selector at six hours in the future . Time selector set plus six hours . Standby , image stabilizer switch . Standing by . - DR. VON STEINER : Switch on . - Switch on . Holding 75,000 and steady . STEVE : Negative . Well , let me increase the power input . Careful . STEVE : I 'll only take it to the limit of safety . DR. VON STEINER : Negative . There 's one other thing we can try . Accelerate the laser beam cycling . Steve , is that safe ? It 's a risk . I say try it . But , Steve , you may blow the system , burn it out . And we may not . If we do , we 're out of business . But if we don 't get this damn thing working , We 're out of business and for good . All right . Try it . - ( VOLTAGE FLUCTUATING ) - Seventy-six thousand and climbing . Hold it , Steve . Enough . I have a circuit overload warning . Better drop the voltage . STEVE : No , wait . It could be the calibrations the future circuits may be on . Try moving the wheel ahead , the major one . Keep going , to the top . Keep going . That 's it , Steve . I 'm past the calibration into the future . - How far ? - Past 100,000 years . Maybe twice that more . I 'm bringing the wheel back . - What was that ? - STEVE : What ? - Well , I thought I saw something . - Nothing . DR. VON STEINER : Time selector set at plus six hours . STEVE : Hold it there . I 'm gonna open up the laser cycling all the way . Steve ! Steve , take her back , take it back . Steve , you 're overshooting . Take it back the other way , the other way . STEVE : The power , cut it ! Wait a minute . Look . The test area . The campus . It couldn 't be . It ... It looks almost prehistoric . There 's a couple of circuits completely fused . The time selector . What 's the reading , Steve ? One hundred and seven years . That 's impossible . In the future . DANNY : Holy McKee . The campus like that in 100 years ? - It couldn 't be . - Of course it couldn 't ... Unless ... The future . A window to the future ... Discovered by accident . This happened before many times . Fleming discovered penicillin by accident , Rontgen , X-rays . And we ... The end of the world . We don 't know that . There 's much to do . We must note every reading . We must know which circuits were fused And what new connections were made . We 're gonna have to work fast . I don 't know how stable that image is . It may collapse at any second . Hey , you know something ? This picture , it isn 't just a picture . It looks like 3D . It looks like you could step right into it . Doc . Hey , doc ! Not now , Danny . Yeah , but look . Well , I 've been trying to tell you it isn 't just a picture . You know what this means ? We must have created not only a window to the future , But a doorway . A time rift , a warp of the space-time continuum Through which matter can pass . Chronic shorts , the fused wiring ... There 's no time . There 's no time . It may collapse as quickly as it came into being . The readings , the new circuits , come on , quick . Hey doc , I 'll take a look out there . Tell you what it 's like . No , Danny . No ! Danny , come back . The warp is unstable . It might collapse . DR. VON STEINER : He can 't hear us . Sound won 't pass through the time portal . Looks like he 's trapped . No , no , Steve . I 'll go . It 's my responsibility . I 'm still the senior here . Both of you , get back to the panel . See that the settings remain exactly as they are . Watch for a burnout . Go on , Steve . ( VOLTAGE FLUCTUATING ) Steve . Steve . What are they ? Watch the panels . Record them up . Steve ! ( DATA CRUNCHING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( VOLTAGE FLUCTUATING ) No . Steve , Erik , come back . Come back . Steve , come back . The portal 's collapsing . Steve , Erik , come back . The portal 's collapsing . Steve , Erik , come back . Carol . Quickly , the portal 's collapsing . - Come on . - Wait , wait . Steve , they came after me . They tried to get into the lab . I had to leave the controls . Steve , look . Get to those rocks . We 'll try and lose them . Come on , come on . DANNY : Come on , face here . I got plenty of ammo . ( GROANING ) That won 't hold them off for long , But there 's a little ... There 's a little cave up the canyon . - How far ? - Oh , a couple of hundred feet . Lead the way . Come on . Right in there ! Carol , over there . Keep an eye out for them . Get as many rocks as you can . Here they come . ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Now . ( SCREAMING ) What is it ? I don 't know . Aah . I got a shock . I got an electric shock . Electricity ? Are you sure ? Doc , if there 's one thing I do know It 's what an electric shock feels like . What do you make of it ? It must be an electrically charged field , A force field barrier . GADRA : That 's quite correct . I am Gadra . Don 't be alarmed . The androids won 't harm you . - Come with me . - Wait a minute . Hold it . How do we know that ... How do you know that you will be safe ? You don 't . DR. VON STEINER : All right . We 'll go with you . Well , it seems we have very little choice . I sympathize with your frustration . 47 , 71 , seal the opening . 67 , let us through . Please . How ? Or is it a secret ? Oh , it 's no secret , But I don 't believe I can make this phenomenon intelligible to you . Try me . Well , it 's a temporary alteration of the molecular structure of the rock . We shrink it , you might say , Through a microscopic hole bored through the rock by the L Tube . A laser beam drill ? Yes . Yes . A modification . Oh , do come with me . All your questions will be answered . Where are you taking us ? To our council chambers . To Dr. Varno , our Council Senior . I knew it , take me to your leader . ( LAUGHS ) Well , Dr. Varno will be as interested in asking you questions As you will be and having yours answered . DR. VON STEINER : The force field barrier saved our lives . We are grateful . But understandably , we 're at a loss for some explanations . Less than an hour ago , We were in my laboratory on our earth . And now ... DR. VARNO : You are still in your own world , Dr. Von Steiner . Earth . The year is 2071 . But our world is dying . Dying ? Except for a few hundred of us here in these caves , Mankind no longer exists . But why , Dr. Varno , how ? I wish I could tell you the reason was a natural or cosmic catastrophe , But I 'm afraid it was man 's own folly . ( CLICKS SWITCH ) ( EXPLOSIONS ) The destruction was total . Earth , our planet , our home , Is now just a burnt out sterile slag in space . The last hill star generation of mutated once-humans , The offspring of the radiation-saturated survivors , Roam the desolate surface Possessed by the insanity of crippling deformities of mind and body . When they are gone , earth will be lifeless . And as incapable of sustaining life As the barren moon itself . Here in our underground domain , we are the descendants Of a small group of far thinking scientists and their families . We are the last normal human beings on earth . How do you plan to survive on an earth that is dead ? We don 't . There is a creeping death all around us and we cannot stay . But where can you go ? To another world . - STEVE : Mars ? - No . No other planet in our solar system can support human life . Then where ? We must go to the stars . To another planetary system Where earth-like worlds have been detected , To the system of Alpha Centauri . Twenty-five thousand billion miles ? Such a journey would take generations . Yes , let me show you something . I think it may interest you all . This is the single purpose of which we live in labor , the starship . It stands in a crater once blown from the very bed rock By a nuclear bomb . The only entrance to it is through our tunnels . It is now being readied for the journey . But generations of ... It 's impossible . - No , you see , we will not be going ... - ( EXPLOSION ) - ( INTERCOM BEEPING ) - Breakthrough ? MAN : No , explosion in fuel primer pit . - Damage ? - Two androids . One , total . One , injured , arm and head . Is the spool intact ? Not known . He 's being taken to the assembly and maintenance four . I 'm coming down . - Gadra , you and Willard check the primer pit . - Yes , sir . Dr. Von Steiner , If you and your party would care to come with me , You will see with your own eyes One of our android assembly plants . WOMAN OVER PA : Attention . Attention . Three android programmed molecular surging needed at the photon drive center . ( INAUDIBLE ) No starship , however gigantic , could possibly carry enough supplies For all of us for more than a generation . Holy McKee . Then how do you propose to make the journey ? In suspended animation . STEVE : Suspended animation ? DR. VARNO : Oh , yes , that 's how we shall do it . To care for us in that state , To service the starship in flight and to help build it , We 're making these androids , Humanoid robots of high skill and intelligence . This is quite a place , doctor . Yes , you see , the androids are constantly being repaired here . You have that many accidents ? No . Of course , they do take on the most dangerous jobs , But there 's quite another matter . You see , they 're often damaged in battle . We 're in a race Which may bring all our efforts to nothing . And we may not win that race . A race ? With whom , Dr. Varno ? DR. VARNO : You 've already encountered them . The mutants ? They 're constantly seeking and finding new ways To penetrate our caves and break down our defenses . We 're under constant attack . That 's why we must always be armed . STEVE : But they 're hardly human , doctor . No , but they 're clever , they 're very cunning . It 's a society organized along military lines . Their primitive life has been forced upon them And they are more dangerous than you think . But you see , it 's only been a few years The mutants have been attacking us at all . Before that , for generations , they shunned us . They held us responsible And there was no need for arms or defenses . But why do they attack you now ? DR. VARNO : They want our stores , our supplies . Food is becoming more and more difficult to come by up there . They are starving . Why can 't you give them the food to keep them from dying ? DR. VARNO : My dear , they 're practically dead already . If we were to give them our food , we 'd soon die too . Yes , the mutants are becoming a very real and ever growing menace . It 's only a question of time before a full scale raid succeeds And wipes out our colony . Before that happens , we must finish the starship or perish . What 's he doing ? Demagnetizing . The head unit is locked on with a magnetic ring . Amazing , Dr. Varno . Amazing . This spool here contains a complete record Of everything the android did right up to the instant of the accident . And by analyzing that , you can find out exactly what went wrong And learn possibly what not to do . Exactly . WOMAN OVER PA : Attention . Four android , report to starship machine shop . DR. VARNO : Come , let me take you to the rooms you will occupy . - We can talk later . - Thank you . Uh , doctor , could I stick around a little longer ? Why , certainly , if you so desire . You 're interested in the plant ? The plant ? Oh , it 's some lab . - Hi . - Be well ? Yeah , you too . You 're a good looking boy . Well , you 're pretty cute yourself . I ... Will you be with me later ? Well , I ... Well , sure , you bet . I know all the single men of the colony , but no one interests me . Well , that 's fine . You do . Will you come into my cubicle ? Sure . My work hours end at 10 : 00 . Where do I ... How do I find your cubicle ? Well , maybe you better meet me in the little rec hall . Anyone will show you the way . Great . Would you put this over there , please ? Sure . See you at 10 : 00 ? Try and stop me . Holy McKee , I thought I was giving her the eye . Be well . Of course , Dr. Von Steiner , We 'll give you all the help you need in reconstructing your time space warp , The portal , back to your own time . Thank you . We 'd like to start at once . It 'll take time . - Can you do it in a month ? - A month ? No , four , maybe three , but ... The starship is scheduled to blast off in one month 's time . But we must return . With what we know now , we must go back and warn everyone . We 'll make it . WILLARD : You will not . And what makes you so sure ? Isn 't it obvious ? The war did happen . You never did go back with your warning . There must be something we can do , Steve ? No , Carol , no . He 's right , we can 't change the past . And we can 't go back . But you can go on with us . Dr. Varno , we 'd be proud to join you . I 'm game . Meanwhile , what can we do to help ? I would like Dr. Connors to work with Willard and myself on the photon drive . There are still rough spots ... Gadra , I don 't see how ... I think it 's an excellent suggestion , Gadra , - Provided Dr. Connors agrees . - Of course . - ( INTERCOM BEEPING ) - Varno , here . MAN : Survey room reporting . Data from Titan surveyor just coming in . Good . Maintain the contact . I shall want to check the results myself . Yes , sir . Dr. Von Steiner , why don 't you come with me ? Thank you . WOMAN : Data collection center . This is Councilman Willard . Ready all starship operations and supply data for a special check . Any specific area ? Yes , capacity calculations . I want to verify the impossibility Of adding extra individuals to the complements . The data will be ready . ( RECEIVING DATA ) How is the contact ? - Top 10 . - Excellent . We have been constantly surveying Every possible planetary body in our solar system , Every planet , every one of their moons , Even some of the smaller asteroids , But this is the last , Titan . One of Saturn 's largest atmosphere carrying moons . - Robots surveyors ? - Yes . You don 't seem encouraged . The analysis shows a complete negative response . I had expected it . But you still maintain surveillance , why ? Information , Dr. Von Steiner , knowledge . We feel we can never have enough of that . The new world we 're going to occupy . There it is . Our entire solar system And nowhere can man exist . Nowhere , including earth . Put the Titan surveyor on the master screen . Yes . Thank you . Let me show you the world we are going to make into our new earth . Come . Is the voyager in position for a good picture of new earth ? - Yes , sir , it is . - Excellent . This is a cosmic camera receiver , Dr. Von Steiner . Between the glass panes is a layer of transparent film . Watch . Alpha Centauri four . It has an oxygen atmosphere , water , Gravity close to the earth 's . It can support life , human life . Instantaneous . Instantaneous transmission , how can this be ? Only instantaneous printing , Dr. Von Steiner . Actually , this picture was transmitted to us with the speed of light . Four and one-half years ago . What you are seeing now is what our new home looked like then . * * What do you think of our lumichord ? Well ? I really didn 't think that they would still be here . And what about us ? ( BUZZES ) You 're running low on liners . You think you can catch up ? Don 't worry . I 'm keeping our spacemen happy . Getting things squared away . Of course , some more conventional fuel will be used for lift off and escape . Cutting down the critical danger stage . Oh , exactly . We 'll only be using an inflammable fuel During the short periods of takeoff and landing on new earth . The photon drive will take over the star journey into deep space . It 's a great improvement over the old ion drive . Old ? We just started to experiment with that . You know , I hate to let my ignorance show in front of such great minds , But what exactly is a photon ? GADRA : Well , it 's a particle of light . Photon propulsion is nothing more nor less than a beam of light . Just a beam of light ? Well , a stream of photons Shooting at 186,000 miles per second from the starship engine Driving it through space on the action-reaction principle . - And it works ? - Indeed it does work . - Willard , perhaps you should ... - Sorry , Gadra . I have no time to conduct a guided tour . ( ALARM RINGING ) What 's that ? Breakthrough . Mutants are somewhere in the cave . Gadra , on your way to your post , - Take the girl to the council chamber . - Yes , I will take her . WILLARD : Stay there , you 'll be safe . You , come with me . We may need every man . Over there in the council chambers . You 'll be safe there . ( RUSTLING ) ( GASPS ) Who are you ? You can 't speak . ( PANTING ) But you do understand me ? Oh . Come , let me help you . WILLARD : Stand aside . I 'll finish him off . No . Do as I say . You will not kill him . But he broke in from outside . Now , get out of the way . You have no right to kill him . What the devil is going on here ? Steve , I got lost . I found this man . He wants to kill him . But he 's from outside . Is that how you treat all strangers ? Shoot them down ? Are we next or we 're just plain lucky ? Steve , you must try to understand . We 've been fighting for our lives for many long years . It 's none of your affair how we handle things like that . As of right now , I 'm making it my affair . If he is from outside , why not send him back ? Why not ? I 'll be glad to throw him back myself . He would not live long , Dr. Von Steiner . He 's a not a mutant . He 's not a human being . He belongs neither to us nor to them . You mean he 's being hunted by everyone ? DR. VARNO : Yes , we 've known for some time that A few of them existed in the caves surrounding our colony , But none of them has ever penetrated before . He must have found some way , triggered the alarm . Then you can 't send him out there . But he 's a deviant . He 's a human being ! Doctor , do I shoot him or throw him back ? No , she 's right , Willard . He is a human being . We are too , so let us not act like mutants . You 'll be safe here now . We 'll have to do something about that injured hand of yours . Come . Come on . Come on . Along with our algae tanks , these hydroponic food and vegetable gardens Will provide us with some of the oxygen we shall need on the journey . And they 'll really survive ? Oh , yes . These are very hardy hybrid strains we 've been cultivating . They 'll be tended and perpetuated by the androids . - Dr. Varno ? - Yes ? I must speak with you , sir . - It 's urgent . - Yes ? In private . Very well , I 'll be with you in a moment . Larry is ready to test the latest quick growth formula . All set , Larry ? All right . Let 's see what we have . - Dr. Varno . - In a minute . Go ahead , open the nutrient flow . The combination of light rays and special nutrient fluids Produces almost instant growth , instant fruition , But making the formula 's a very difficult and time consuming process . We hope to get enough to grow food on our new earth Till we can raise our first normally produced crop . Holy McKee . ( LAUGHS ) These are hybrid oranges , our vitamin C supply . Larry , let them have a taste . Don 't be afraid of it , Dr. Connors . They 're guaranteed non-sour . Yes , Willard , what do you want ? Go ahead , Steve . I always liked oranges . You first . DR. VON STEINER : He 's right . They aren 't sour . STEVE : Delicious . DANNY : No pits . Just wasn 't anybody until Danny came along , So I 've decided to take him . You 're not giving yourself much time . Oh , I haven 't got it . Look , Danny 's a wonderful fellow , But don 't you think you 're rushing things a little ? Well , maybe you ought to do a little rushing yourself . Oh ? REENA : Oh , with Steve , I mean . You do want him , don 't you ? Yes . Yes , I do . Well , there are still plenty of unattached females in the colony . Oh . When the right time comes along , I 'm sure ... Well , don 't be . The way a girl goes about catching a man here is to be faster than he is . And we 've got some real athletes . We 've all been told not to waste time . We 've got to be ready for a minor population explosion As soon as we get to the new earth . Boy , I kind of look forward to that , don 't you ? WOMAN OVER PA : Attention please . Attention . Dr. Von Steiner , Dr. Connors , Miss White , Mr. McKee . Please report to the council chambers . Dr. Von Steiner ? Dr. Von Steiner ? Please report to the council chambers . Dr. Connors ? Dr. Connors ? Please report to the council chambers . Miss White ? Miss White ? Please report to the council chambers . Mr. McKee ? Mr. McKee ? Please report to the council chambers . DR. VARNO : Councilman Willard has made an exhaustive study of the problem . The starship has been constructed To serve an exactly calculated number of humans and androids . Four additional humans would also mean extra air and nutrient for them For over a generation 's time . Storage space , Extra suspended animation enclosures And additional androids . Willard has pointed out very conclusively That this would mean extensive alterations in the starship 's design . Dr. Von Steiner , we do not have time for such alterations . At Willard 's request , the council has decided It will be impossible for us to take you with us on the journey . You 're leaving us here ? Dr. Varno ? It is not our desire . It is bitter necessity . STEVE : There must be a way to lick the problem . It would mean taking time . Then take it . We 'll do anything we can to help . You don 't understand . Damn it , you can 't abandon us here . The starship must take off at the specified time . There can be no delay . Delay ? How much could there be ? Even a second would be too much . The automatic pilot of the ship has been completely programmed , A job requiring months . The calculations are critical . The ship must be launched at the exact specified time . An error , a delay of even seconds here Could result in light years at our destination . Too much for correction . That is final . You are pronouncing our death sentence . I don 't enjoy doing it . You resented us from the beginning . I have , but that is not why I 'm doing this . I ... We must consider the greater good . I must do what I think is right . And what about us ? Nobody invited you here . At least give us a chance to try and find a solution . It is impossible . Until you 've tried and failed , nothing is impossible . This is . A lot of others like you busily explaining why things can 't be done Have been interrupted by people doing them . Rants . Or is it just you who shies away from a challenge ? I find it quite unnecessary to waste the council 's time with argumentative platitudes . We 've taken a vote ! The matter is closed . Just like that ? You seem to enjoy throwing people to those mutants . You have just said you consider nothing impossible , Then why don 't you reconstruct your time warp portal And go back where you came from ? I want you to know the vote was not unanimous . Dr. Varno and I ... Thank you , Gadra . It would be an idle gesture to say that I regret it . I understand . Stay here in the council chamber and decide what you will do . Let me know and we 'll give you every possible help we can . And after you leave , Varno , how much time will we still have left ? Looks like we 've had it , huh , doc ? No , Danny . We 'll not give up . We 're not beaten until we do . All right . Now , let 's look at the choices we have , doc . We can make the caves as impregnable as possible against the mutants . Well , the odds would be overwhelming against us . Even if we could , what kind of a future would we have ? I reject it . There 's no other place in our solar system we could go Even if we had the means . There is no other place we could live . One choice left then and only one . We build a portal or die . Steve is almost ready . We 'll be finished too . We 've programmed the board with every detail we 've remembered , Circuits , settings . It 's just got to be close . Danny ? Take me back with you . Oh , Reena , I can 't do that . You belong out there and I belong where ? Don 't you like me ? Of course I like you . You 're a beautiful girl . Oh , that . Beauty 's only skin deep . Well , it 's deep enough , isn 't it ? What do you want , a lovely liver ? ( LAUGHS ) Please don 't joke . Danny , I love you . Let me go back with you . Reena , I can 't take you back with me . You know what I 'm going back to if I 'm going back at all . But I don 't care . Besides , I 'm already engaged . You are ? Mmm-hmm . Big tall girl , about six feet but bright , You should see her eyes flash And ask her any question , gives you the answer . Why didn 't you tell me ? Most beautiful electronic computer in the good old USA . Oh , Danny . Your Danny can joke at a time like this ? Can you think of a better time ? Oh , doctor , thanks for letting Reena and Gadra help us out . It was their own request . From what I can see from these plans , there may be a connection . Certainly worth a try . Let me show you how this works . It 's really perfectly safe . We 'll need a guinea pig . Danny ? Would you be good enough to help us out for a few moments ? - Sure , doc . - Come . Reena . Dr. Varno . Activate the vibro transporter , please . Yes , sir . The vibro transporter is a matter transmitter . It breaks down solid matter into its component vibrations And sends them out like waves to be received and re-solidified elsewhere . Much as an ordinary radio does with sound waves . Oh , well , I understand that . ( LAUGHS ) I wish I did . Would you like to take a little trip ? Well , it 's okay with me . Come . Me up there ? It may be a little uncomfortable , but it won 't take long . Well , thanks a bunch . Be well , gang . Hey , doc , What 's with the Section 8 treatment ? Have a nice trip . ( MACHINE POWERING UP ) Hey , doc , if this thing 's so safe , why all the safety belts ? Hey ! Whoa . ( LAUGHS ) Now , I know how a roasting chicken feels . Whoo , just like a fun house . Whoa . ( LAUGHS ) Hey ... Dr. Varno , he 's all right , isn 't he ? Yes , of course he is . Watch . - How do you feel ? - Never better . There are no ill effects . Thank you , Danny . Oh , anytime , doc . Thanks for the trip . I 'll recommend it . It 's fabulous , but why can 't you use it ? The transmitter needs a receiver . In effect , in order to go someplace , We 'd have to be there in order to get there . Oh , of course . The important thing is that certain principles of the transporter Can be modified for use in perfecting your time warp portal . Come . ( VOLTAGE FLUCTUATING ) Try it now . We 'll start loading operations as soon as the ship is secure . Everything is ready . How much time do we have ? The last groups are boarding now . MAN : with your androids . Group number 21 , board the ship with your androids . How long ? How near ready is the portal ? I don 't know . My friend , this is the crucial moment . Our force field power plant has been transferred to the ship . Our defenses are at their weakest . Almost fully automatic . The likelihood of a successful mutant attack is at its strongest . It 's a bad combination . But they may be unaware . No . We 've tried to keep them away , But we know they 've been watching us from the crater rim . They 're aware that most of our stores have gone into the ship . And this is their last chance to get them . If they realize how close we are to lift off ... And what will happen after the starship is gone ? MAN : Group number 22 , ready your androids . Stand by to board . Group number 22 , standby . ( ALARM RINGING ) - Carol , where is Carol ? - I don 't know , Steve . Wait a minute , she 's with Reena , resting . They 've breeched control . Danny , come on . No , you stay here . Help Von Steiner get that portal to work . Gadra , have you seen Reena and Carol ? Yes , Steve , in the rain bath . Wait a minute . You can 't go out there , The mutants are everywhere , they 're fighting all over . MAN : Dr. Varno ? Dr. Varno ? Starship pilot request instructions . Urgent , urgent . Dr. Varno , come in . - They 're all over . - ( GUNSHOT ) ( STATIC CRACKLING ) Varno here . Varno to comm center , come in . Come in . Come in . ( GUNSHOTS ) Steve , over there . Willard , we 've got to keep them outside while the portal is going . Look , have you got anything bigger than these peashooters ? No , they couldn 't be used in the caves . All right . Give the androids guns . - It 's no use . - What ? They 're only programmed for defense . This is too much of an offensive weapon , they won 't use it . Steve , we 're ready for a try . ( EXPLOSION ) The mutants must have blown up the primer pit . Take off now , now . ( ENGINE BOOSTING ) ( SWITCH CLICKS ) Everybody , over here . Let them work in the portal . Now , get your weapons out and form a line . ( BANGING ON DOOR ) Stage one . Now , Reena . ( VOLTAGE FLUCTUATING ) The campus . But it looks so strange , so dead . ( THUMPING ) ( MUTANTS SCREAMING ) Stage two . Now , Reena . Stage three . Steve , Danny . Everybody , go to the street . Danny , all the girls . Go , go . DANNY : Aim at the panels . DR. VON STEINER : Come on , Steve . We better get back to the lab right away . The original portal may still be open . Doc . What 's happening ? Our calculations were not exact enough . We 've returned too far back in time . Well , why aren 't we ... Aren 't they moving ? Somehow we 've disrupted the time flow . It 's as if we were existing outside of time in limbo . What do we do ? What we came here for . Shut the machines down . They 're frozen , I can 't move them . Steve , look , nothing can be moved . Hey , doc . They are moving . Only so slow , you can 't see them , Like the hands on a watch . I 'm in a different position now , I really am . He 's right , Erik , he 's right . We 're right here with them , But we 're living our lives at such an accelerated time rate , Such fantastic speed , That we 'd only be fleeting shadows to them if they see us at all . You 're right , Steve . We 're all existing in a different time rate , Perhaps a million times faster than normal . It seems we are aging more than a year for every minute that goes by . In a few moments we shall cease to exist . There 's got to be a way out of this . It 's a time trap . Time itself is an anachronism . We 're compounding it by appearing here . Steve , I remember what happened . In a few seconds the portal will ... Wait . - There is a chance . - DR. VARNO : What ? Screen . But it 's nothing . STEVE : How do we know that ? The image pulsation may be frozen in time like everything else . It 's possible . The laser beam cycling had already been accelerated . The portal may still be open . To what ? When ? The time selector is at the extreme future , Past the 100,000 year mark . I ... I can 't change it . Let 's find out if this thing is open . Come on , you 've got to get going . I don 't know what 's out there , it 's really dark . Steve , what will it be like after all these centuries ? Are you sure ? I 'm sure of one thing ... We stay here , we die . All right , now , everybody , stay together . Grab each other 's hand . It 's very dark out there . Be careful . All right , Danny , get Reena . Carol . DR. VON STEINER : I 'm bringing the wheel back . CAROL : What was that ? STEVE : What ? CAROL : I thought I saw something . STEVE : Nothing . DR. VON STEINER : Time selector back at plus six hours . Hold it . I 'm gonna open up the laser cycling all the way . Steve ! Take her back , take it back . Steve , you 're overshooting . Take it back the other way , the other way . STEVE : The power , cut it ! Wait a minute . Look . ( INAUDIBLE )

The unpredictable Admiral Harriman Nelson has done it again . His brainchild , a fantastic atomic submarine with an amazing glass nose , is now undergoing final tests below the ice at the North Pole . To judge the final test , the Bureau of Maríne Exploratíon has sent a seaplane wíth íts top officer , the former více-admíral , B J Crawford , to rendezvous wíth the submaríne Seavíew ín the Arctíc . Flyíng wíth hím ís the Congressíonal watchdog of the budget , penny-pínchíng Congressman Llewellyn Parker , who had fought a losíng fight agaínst what he had termed " Nelson 's folly . " And so the questíon of the day comes to thís : Wíll the final test on the USOS Seavíew turn ít ínto " Nelson 's folly " ? Or wíll ít be another tríumph of a great man , a great ínventor , who , despíte hís oddball reputatíon , may yet emerge as the predomínant scíentifíc geníus of our tíme ? So , bon voyage , Admíral Nelson . Good luck , Seavíew . Well , gentlemen , modesty forbids my adding anything to that . - Shall we take her down , Cap 'n ? - Aye aye , sir . - Let 's make it 90 feet at the start , what ? - Aye aye , sir . Diving stations ! Diving stations ! - Any time you 're ready , Mr Thompson . - Aye aye , sír . Stand by . Clear the decks , Mr Thompson . - Decks clear ! - Decks clear . - Prepare to dive . - Close all main ballast-tank vents . Stand by to blow tanks . Ballast tanks full . Close the vents . Flood negative . Full dive on the planes . 15 degrees down bubble . Secure the air . - All green ? - All green . Dive ! More dive ! - Pressure in the boat . - Up scope . - 9-0 feet . - Level off at 9-0 feet . Down scope . All ahead two-thirds . All ahead two-thirds . - Final trim , Captain . - Carry on . Well , final trim , sir . Depth 9-0 feet . Speed two-thirds . Well , Lee , it 's been a long , tough haul from conception to execution , but , my boy , we 've done it . You 've done it , sir . You know , it bears out what you taught us at Annapolis : That " The wild dreams of today are the practical realities of tomorrow . " I 'm glad you remembered one of my more temperate quotes . Some of our colleagues haven 't been quite so diplomatic . Say , speaking of diplomacy , we 've got some guests to entertain . I 've met ' em . Now it 's your turn . Remember , they hold the purse strings to this " folly . " - Shall we dress ? - Dress ? Black tie . Let 's go . - Take the con , Ned . I 'll be forward . - Aye aye , sir . - Beautiful , isn 't it ? - It 's the most exotic thing I 've ever seen . No more , thank you . Admiral ! Nice to see you , sir . - Captain Crane . Dr Hiller . - How do you do ? - Congressman Parker . - Sir . You have an expensive toy here , Admiral . Though it ís suitable for sightseeing . Quite right , sir . We hope to see sights never before seen by man , and by seeing , solve some of the mysteries of the deep . Sorry for the brief hello earlier , but this " toy " of mine is a demanding lady . Aren 't we all ? Washington probably thought you needed a woman 's touch around here . - Research project , isn 't it ? - Yes . The Reactíon of Crewmen to Lengthy Confinement . Yes , Admiral . I appreciate the honor of being the only woman aboard . Ah , but you 're not . We have another one . You 'll meet her . - Shall we see the rest of the ship ? - I did think that was the purpose of our visit . Doctor . Congressman . The control room . The " brain " of the sub . Over here , we have our chauffeurs . It takes two to run this toy - helmsman and planesman . Now , on a submarine , it 's always Christmas . That 's what I 've been telling Congress . Wrong deduction , sir . That 's our " Christmas tree " - tells us when we can dive . Now , if we go down before all those lights are green , we start bailing . Over here , we have our ballast control . - How does it work ? - Like an elevator system , Doctor . Takes us up and lets us down . Now , on this side , that is radar , this is sonar . Sonar stops us running into anything under the water . Radar does the same thing on the surface . Oh , try this one , Congressman . Two s 's in progress . Now , if you 'll come down here , Doctor . This is our missile-tracking tape . If we have to shoot , we like to know where the missile is going . And if we do shoot , over there are the buttons . The trick is to know which one . - Suppose the other fella shoots first ? - In that event , sir , that 's the way out . This way , Doctor , please . And watch your step here . The radio shack . Lee . Excuse me . This way , please . Sparks , make that Washington call in exactly 11 minutes , what ? Aye aye , sir . Not even Jules Verne dreamed of anything like this . - The world 's only undersea aquarium . - What on earth is he doing ? - Shark-walking . - Shark-walking ? Come on , Bessie . Come on . For ages , man has been trying to learn the secret of the fish . Now we have a perfect underwater laboratory . Well , Lucius , back with your fish again , I see . BJ ! It 's nice to see you . Commodore Emery , this is Dr Hiller and Congressman Parker . How do you do ? I still don 't understand what he 's doing . He regards all sea creatures as personal friends . He 'd rather be remembered for discovering a new fish than as a leading physicist of our time . - May I explain ? - I wish you would . My little friend Bessie here , we had to drug her in order to do some tests . Now I 'm trying to force some water through her gills so she doesn 't drown . In this condition , she won 't even bite a congressman . - She 's the only one on board who wouldn 't ! - You 're much too sensitive . - Right you are , Doctor . Come on , everybody . - See you later , Lucius ... I hope ! Come on ! Hup , two , three ! Come on , get going . You 've seen the " brain " of the sub . In here is the " heart " , the atomic-motor room . - Careful , sir . That 's our warning system . - Disregard . No one is allowed in there . Not even congressmen . You understand . For your own safety . Now , down here you 'll find the " sting " of the ship . In fact , there are more " stings " in here than in a hornet 's nest . The missile and escape room . There is more destructive force in this room than in all the explosive used in WWll . The missiles are for research . Experimental torpedoes . You name ' em , we 've got ' em . - Show ' em , Lee . - Right . Well , let 's see . Here 's something new - a magnetic primer . In case we lose power in the control room , we just slap this dude on by hand , and away she goes . - This looks like a pineapple . - Some pineapple . One bite , and pow ! - Don 't worry , it can 't activate itself . - Captain , where does this door lead to ? That leads to Davy Jones ' locker , sir . - If you 're contemplating using it , use this . - Oh , no . No , thank you . No offense , sir . Red ! Well , shall we continue ? BJ . Take a look at this lad . He 's Seaman Smith . Recognize him ? Should I ? Seems only yesterday you were bouncing him on your knees . Old Bricktop 's boy ! Spittin ' image of him , too . I heard that he 'd finished his hitch in the navy , so I had him sign up with us . He looks a little big for me to bounce on my knee now . Jimmy , isn 't it ? Now you 're a minisub man , huh ? - How do you like the new model ? - Oh , she handles like a dream , sir . - I can 't wait to test her under the ice . - You will . Good luck . - Thank you , sir . - Sorry to break in on your social life . Back to work . This should interest you , Doctor . Dr Jamieson . Dr Hiller . Congressman Parker . - How do you do ? - Happy to meet you , Congressman . The Dr Hiller ? It 's a pleasure to welcome such a distinguished psychiatrist aboard . You flatter me . You seem very well-equipped here , and pleasantly unoccupied . We hope to keep it that way , with the help of these gadgets . It 's mandatory that you wear our newest style in submarine sportswear . If you pick up a fatal dose of radiation , it glows red . - A fatal dose of radiation ? - There 's a warning . It loses all its color first . By the way , give me one of those for Admiral Crawford . I have some healthier places to show our guests . I 'll check in later with you , Doctor . See ya . This way , please . Ah , there you are . I 've just introduced our guests to Dr Jamieson . - Admiral , here 's your dosimeter . - Good man , Jamieson . He 'll keep you filled in on statistics . Attention ! Well , Admiral , I suppose she 's your dancing dietitian . And he 's your musical chef . - She is my secretary , and as for him ... - I 'm to blame , sir . I started it all . I have no doubt of that . I said another woman was aboard . I hardly expected you to meet her under such boisterous circumstances . It all seems very gay and happy , and I am here to observe . Yes - not choreography to a trumpet . Mr Romano , belay the noisy horn . As for you , Miss Connors , we shall have a little talk later . - Doctor . - I 'll have a talk now , Lieutenant . Outside ? Romano , aren 't you about due back on duty ? Not for another two minutes yet , sir . - Now , Lieutenant ... - Yes . - " Yes , sir . " - Sir ! I 'm sure your act will get a wonderful review in the Congressíonal Record . - Will they break me ? - They 've broken better men for less . How do you explain this undignified behavior ? I was just showing them how I 'll dance at my wedding . I see . Well , that is an extenuating circumstance . - In about three weeks , isn 't it ? - And two days and four hours . Who 's the unlucky man ? Pardon me , Captain . May I ? By all means , Lieutenant . What did you say about undignified behavior , Captain ? Captaín Crane . Control room , please . We 'll continue this discussion later , Lieutenant . Callíng Seavíew . Come in , Washington . - We 're making contact , sir . - Very well . - You called me , sir . - Yes . We 're through to Washington . - Stand by to take her deep . - Right . All set , sir . Inspector Bergen 's on the line . Bergen . Nelson here . How 's she runníng ? Like a clock . We 're all set to make our dive under the ice . Official checkout time 3 : 42 . - Make it 500 feet , what ? - Aye aye , sir . We 'll be out of sound range in a few seconds , and then ride radio silence for 96 hours . - Give him my regards . - BJ sends his best to you landlubbers . Is he seasíck yet ? He was the worst saílor ín the navy . Well , good huntíng . Thank you , Inspector . Keep a light burning . - Hi , Susan . - Oh ! Hi , Cathy . - Personnel file you asked for . - Ah , thanks . Have some hot coffee ? Best prescription you 've written today , Doctor . Say , this Captain Crane of yours is surprisingly young for ajob this size . He was the youngest sub captain in the navy . He must have a friend at court . The admiral ? That 's a bad diagnosis , Doctor . They are almost like father and son , but the captain earned his rank . Neither he nor the admiral would have it any other way . No criticism intended . I 'm sure you 'll both live happily ever after , but settling down isn 't going to be an easy adjustment after all this . Well , I was born on a farm , and I 'm going back . We 've bought a ranch in Colorado ... - What do you read ? - Can 't make it out , sir . - Iceberg , sir ? - I don 't know . - Nose camera . - Camera on . Take over . I 'll be forward . Here they are . - Admiral ... - How deep are we ? Riding at 500 feet . 650 left from keel to bottom . Take her to 1,000 . Take her to 1,000 feet . Emergency ! - Sonar ? - Clear overhead , sir . - Surface ! - Surface ! Surface ! Congressman , you and the ladies go aft . It might be safer there . Break out the polar gear . Let 's go , BJ . - Just breaking surface , sir . - All stop . - Crack the hatch . Let 's go . Come on , BJ . - Crack the hatch ! - My God . - The sky 's on fire ! What happened ? Come on , let 's find out . Get Washington . - Hurry up . Make it quick . Get Washington ! - Aye aye , sir . - There 's a magnetic storm , sir . - Can you clear it ? I 'm trying , sir . USOS Seavíew calling Washington . Come in , Washington . - I can 't seem to break through , sir . - Keep trying . Admiral Nelson calling Bureau of Marine Exploration - Inspector Bergen . Rescue team , up and out on the double ! Man on the ice ! Belay the parkas ! Rescue team , topside ! On the double ! - All set , sir . Inspector Bergen 's on the line . - Pipe this through the ship . Bergen , we 've just seen it . What is it ? Nelson ! We 've been callíng you for three days . - What 's that fire in the sky ? - The Van Allen belt of radíatíon . The 300-míle level . It caught fire about 50 hours ago . Nobody knows how . But a South Afrícan observatory reported heavy meteor actívíty at the tíme ít exploded . - It 's possible . - What 's the forecast ? We just don 't know . The UN has called an emergency scíentifíc conference . The world 's top braíns are there - Píttar , Zucco , Charbíer . - The presídent wants you there . - Can you send a plane for me ? Thermal condítíons have grounded all aírcraft . There 's nothíng flyíng anywhere ín the world . The temperature has reached 135 degrees . We don 't know how much hotter ít wíll get . DEWlíne headquarters just below the pole reports the polar ícecaps are meltíng . OK , we 're on our way . Be there in two days . Godspeed . Out . - Let 's get going , Cap 'n . - In a moment , sir . Picked up a survivor . Doc , lend a hand . He must have been there two days . - He 's burned to a crisp . - Who is he ? I don 't know . Let 's get him to sick bay . - Take her down . Full speed New York . - New York ? - Aye aye , sir . - He had this pooch with him . - Take care of him . - And here are his papers . All right , take her down . Periscope depth . Dive ! Full dive on the planes ! Flood negative ! - All ahead , full ! - All ahead , full ! - What 's his name ? - Miguel Alvarez . A civilian scientist . Doing a government survey on Ice Floe Delta . - Lucky to be alive . - So are we . Yeah . How is he , Doctor ? Severe exposure . Small wonder , lying out there in 135 degrees heat for two days . - Jim ... - Listen , Doctor . Jim ... Are you there ? I can 't hold on . It 's breaking away . The ice floe 's drifting . Jim ... Jim , can you hear me ? Mac ! You there ? Mac ... Mac ... There must be others still out there on that ice ! This is the captain . Reverse course . Repeat , reverse course . Rescue team , stand by . This is Admiral Nelson . Hold your course . You heard what he said . We can 't leave without searching for survivors ! Captain Crane , if we waste any time at all here , there may be no survivors left anywhere in the world . Mac ... Mac , help me . Please ! Help me ! Mac ! Mac , help me ... I 've got it , Lieutenant . Sir ... I didn 't know there was a regulation about not picking up survivors . Lee ? Lee ? The chances are no one 's still alive out there anyway . He was still alive , wasn 't he ? The blazíng Van Allen belt contínues to spread a path of death and destructíon . The rísíng heat has touched off ragíng forest fires ín the Ural Mountaíns of Russía , the Black Forest of Germany , and the rích French tímberlands . These film clíps ... Let 's see how the rest of the crew 's taking it . The sítuatíon grows more desperate wíth the report that ... - They still at it , Cookie ? - For more than 24 hours , sir . They 've eaten nothing but coffee and pencils in all that time . Excuse me . I 'd better see if he needs me . The projection must be on the nose . No margin for error . Now , if these figures prove out , the ... - Keeping you awake , Harry ? - Ahh ... Yeah . Uh , now , the last temperature reading ... It checks . It checks on the nose ! Lucius , I think we 've hit it . Oh , you 're always so sure of everything . If the temperature maintains the same rate of progression , - and if we can get there by the 29th ... - 29th ? It has to be the 29th . ... and project at exactly 16 hours ... BJ , it 's right . I don 't see how we can miss ! - Do you need me , sir ? - Huh ? Oh , no , Connors . Thank you . Close the door on the way out , please . Lucius . - Now what ? - Get off that couch . Let 's double-check these figures . I do more walking for you than I do with the shark . Yeah . Now , at the present rate of temperature rise ... The fiery sky ís threateníng to stríke a mortal blow at the heart of the Mídwest Farm Belt . Thousands of acres of vítal graín have already shríveled under the íntense heat , gívíng ríse to fears of famíne if the flamíng belt contínues to rage unchecked . In Italy , all roads leadíng to Rome and the Vatícan have been jammed for two days . The faíthful have been streamíng towards St Peter 's to pray for delíverance from the catastrophe whích has struck Earth . Here now , our televísíon satellíte camera ín outer space , showíng the fríghteníng ríng of fire encírclíng the Earth . Ladíes and gentlemen , thís concludes our broadcast for today . Well , there 'll be a hot time in the ol ' world tonight ! That 's not even funny , Mac . - Attention ! - As you were . Well , you 've all seen it . There 's not much to add , except to tell you that the situation is far from hopeless . In New York , the greatest scientific minds in the world are at work , analyzing ways and means of survival . And we have two of the best scientific minds right here in this boat . Sir . Sir , what about leave ? I live in New York , and I got a baby that 's new in the family . I 'm sorry , there hasn 't been any word on leaves yet . But I 'll keep you all posted . We 've just receíved word that Admíral Nelson ís ín the buíldíng , ín the lower hallway . Excítement has been at fever pítch sínce last níght 's radío report from the submaríne Seavíew that he had conceíved a plan whích hopefully míght extínguísh the flamíng Van Allen belt . Now , several theoríes are already under consíderatíon by the UN . In fact , yesterday Dr Zucco , the emínent physícíst of Víenna , presented hís own plan , whích ín essence says " Hands off . Let 's waít and see . " Unofficíal sources tell us that Dr Zucco 's arguments swayed the scíentifíc body , and they míght gíve hím theír stamp of approval . However , in view of Admiral Nelson 's scientific achievements , we 've been advised that the international scientific committee is standing pat , until Nelson 's plan can be evaluated . ... doít être consumé que par le feu . Non , non , non , non , non ! Arrêtez . Tout ce que nous faísons ící ... Some woman is a bit hysterical . Nerves are on edge , and this may be one of the most important moments in history . The admíral and Commodore Emery are comíng ínto the conference room now . Les vues , à ce sujet , de notre collègue dístíngué ... Je demande la permíssíon , à M. Le présídent , de donner la parole à I 'amíral Nelson . We thank the French delegate for his remarks , and we will take them under advisement . We acknowledge the arrival of two of the world 's most distinguished scientists , Admiral Nelson and Commodore Emery . And now , the chair will listen to Admiral Nelson . Mr Chairman , distinguished scientists , ladies and gentlemen . This planet is impaled on a roasting spit , slowly but inexorably being seared and blistered by the fire in the sky . If the Van Allen belt continues to burn , the world will burn with it . And no one can doubt that civilization as we know it will disintegrate if the temperature should rise to 175 degrees . Now , in the last five days the recorded temperature rise has been two degrees every 24 hours . If that rate is maintained , our planet has a life expectancy of about three weeks . Therefore ... therefore , if we are to avoid cremation , we must act at once . Lucius , let me have those charts of ours and the maps , please . Thank you . Now , if I may make a comparison , when a diseased appendage threatens the life of a human body , a doctor has no choice but to amputate . We have no choice either . We must amputate the belt , or die . Amputate ? How ? Not with a knife , Doctor , but with a shot in the heart . The burning belt must be exploded clear of the Earth 's magnetic field , and we have exactly 16 days and three hours in which to do it . - How do you arrive at that particular timing ? - How ? We have worked out the mathematical formula , and our figures are correct . He irritates me . The shot must take place on August 29th at exactly 4pm . The locatíon of thís operatíon ís as vítal as the tíme . A place 205 míles north-northwest of Guam ín the Maríanas Islands . To be exact ... Where are those figures , Lucíus ? Ah . To be exact , latitude 15 degrees north , longitude 145 degrees east . The location and the time are dictated by the Earth 's rotation and the consequent trajectory of firing . Firing of what , Admiral ? An atomic missile , Doctor , fired from the submarine Seavíew . The missile will arc along the burning belt . As it detonates , it will give the flames an overdose of radiation , causing the belt to explode outward into space . To simplify it , take a toy balloon . A little too much air , and poof ! No balloon . - A little too much radiation , and ... - Poof ! No world ! Perdío ! Quello lì , lo ammazzo ! Insanity ! Insanity ! This lunatic scheme will destroy us all ! Gentlemen , care to look at our figures ? Figures ! The admiral 's scheme is suicidal insanity . You should know that , Commodore . Explode the belt and you explode the world ! Not if the blast is directed away from us ! No , no , no ! I am díametrícally opposed . I know the chemícal composítíon of the gases wíthín the belt and the rate of consumptíon by fire . My calculatíons cannot be wrong ! I say the belt wíll burn ítself out . At 173 degrees , ít wíll burn ítself out ! Fine . What if it doesn 't burn itself out ? You have your plan , I have mine . Time will judge which one is right . Doctor , our plan can 't wait . You say the belt will burn out at 173 degrees . At the present rate of climb , that 's August 30th . We say it won 't burn out , but we can 't wait to test our theory because we must fire the missile on August 29th . - Otherwise , we lose our angle of trajectory . - Then this body must decide who is right ! I 'm not going to wait . I have 16 days to get to the Marianas , and I shall need every ounce of speed and every precious moment of time . Lucius , have the captain stand by to get under way . I demand the scheme be referred to committee . - There 's no time ! - Then I call a vote . - All in favor of the admiral 's scheme ? - Aye ! - All those against ? - No ! - There 's your answer . - Not mine , yours . My answer shall come only from the president of the United States . - Stop him ! - No ! - We 'll never get out . - Go to the basement . - But the congressman and the admiral ! - We have to leave them . Phew , this heat ! Hold these , Lieutenant . Get out of this . Aboard ship ! Cast off ! Clear the deck ! - You all right ? - I 'll tell you in just a minute , - as soon as I get my breath . - Crash-dive . - What ? - You heard me . Crash-dive . The UN police are on deck . A crash dive 'll kill ' em ! Give ' em a 15-second warning to clear off and then dive . Come on , Lucius . Attention . This is the captain . This sub will dive in 15 seconds . Clear the deck . Sound the klaxon . Sail camera on ! Close all main ballast-tank vents . Repeat warning . This sub is diving immediately . Clear the deck ! - All right , take her down . - Prepare to dive . - Ballast tanks full . - All green ! Dive ! Dive ! Bow 's under . Deck 's awash . Stern gone . Take the con , Lieutenant . I 'll be in the admiral 's cabin . Lee ! - He had no other choice . - I hope Washington agrees with you . I don 't understand ordering a crash dive with men on deck . - Zucco just can 't be right . - We 'd better make deadly sure he 's wrong . Come in . - Sir . - Oh , forget it , Lee . Military police swim like fish . It 's part of their training . Now here 's our goal . The Marianas . And we 've only got 16 days to get there . What do you think , Cap 'n ? The Panama Canal is knocked out . To go around the Horn doubles our distance . - In my opinion , I 'm afraid it 's impossible . - Impossible ? Sounds like Zucco . Nothing is impossible . We 'll make it if we get the president 's permission . Cap 'n , set your course for the Marianas , as though we had permission . - And give us all the speed you can make . - Sir ... Cap 'n ! Very well , sir . Ah , Doctor . Mr Alvarez . I 'd forgotten you were aboard . My orders did not include a trip to the Marianas . Admiral , I must get off the submarine . There may be no chance to get into port , Doctor . You 'll both have to go along for the ride . Yes ? Sparks , sir . No contact yet . Since the heat went over 139 , radio contact is highly erratic . The radíatíon has set up a field of statíc . Forget that . Keep at it . I must talk with the president . - Aye aye , sír . - Now look here ... Doctor , as I remember , your research project was " men under stress . " You couldn 't have picked a better laboratory . Glad you 're up and about , Mr Alvarez . Sorry you didn 't get ashore , but I 'm sure we 'll find something to keep you busy . Don 't worry about me , Admiral . Man must accept what is ordained . That 's a convenient rationalization , but under the circumstances , there seems to be no alternative . - Check the heat . - Up scope . - How hot is it up there ? - 141.2 degrees . No snow today ! Down scope . USOS Seavíew calling Washington . Come in , Washington . 25 hours of static in my ears ! Man , I 'm getting shell shock ! Now I 'll say it again , loudmouth . You talk pretty big , - behind the admiral 's back ! - Yeah ? Well , here 's a message for you . Special delivery . Hold it ! Hold it ! Knock it off ! Break it up ! Attention ! Now , I don 't know who or what started this , but the next fight ends up in the brig . - Is that clear ? - Yes , sir . Now you two men shake hands and forget it . Carry on . - Question , Cap 'n . - Shoot . Are we heading for the Pacific ? I 'd answer that question , Gleason , if I could . But I can 't . We certainly are heading someplace fast . Sir ? Maybe home , sir ? I can tell you this : We 've been heading south for the last 25 hours . Whether we stay on course depends on the president . The admiral 's still trying to contact him . As for home ... You 'll be home with that new baby on your knee before you know it . - But what about this burning belt , Captain ? - Captaín , I 've just pícked up Míamí . - That 's my home town ! - Hey , what about that , huh ? - Sparks , pipe it through the ship . - Aye aye , sír . And the news from París ís just as dísastrous . The rísíng Seíne has overrun íts banks , floodíng out thousands of homes ín the low-lyíng areas . From Moscow , reports índícate a severe shortage of water , as wells from the Ukraíne to the Steppes all dry up . In Chína and Indía , condítíons are chaotíc , as ríots and pestílence sweep the land . Meanwhíle , the heat has burned líke a gíant torch across the face of Afríca . Terror-strícken herds of wíld anímals , fleeíng from the blazíng forests to the open plaíns , are dyíng of thírst around mud-caked water holes . Other reports índícate that steamíng waters from the meltíng North and South Poles are beíng sucked ínto the aír currents , spreadíng weírd , freakísh fog banks throughout the world . In many areas , dense fog severely hampers vítal operatíons . In thís country , the blísteríng heat contínues to blaze a path of destructíon across the Mídwest graín belt . The rích farmland of Ameríca ís now almost a waste ... Excuse me . - What 's the matter ? - Hey , what 's the story , Captain ? Sparks , did we lose contact ? No , sír . The admíral ordered a news blackout . - Hey ... - All right , knock it off ! - Yes ? - Sir , why did you black out the news ? A matter of morale , Captain . No news is better than bad news . Sir , this is no time to cut the men off from the world . There may be no world at all , Cap 'n , if we don 't start makíng news . May I be excused , sir ? What was that about the fog ? Do you remember ? Lee ! Simmer down . I know the admiral was rough , and I also know about maritime regulations . It had nothing to do with regulations . It 's a matter of common decency ! - The men have a right to know the facts . - Have a cup of coffee ... - I don 't want any coffee ! - Please ! You know the admiral . We 've never known him to be wrong on a question of policy . - Even if it ruins morale ? - That 's what he hopes to avoid ! He has a strange way of showing it ! There may be some here whose friends and loved ones have already gone to meet their maker . If it is God 's will that they , and we , shall die , so be it . Ajoyous reunion can be only a brief moment away . That 's enough , Mr Alvarez . That 's more than enough . What kind of talk is this anyway ? - I only came to offer comfort . - Comfort ? You offer defeatism ! This is a federal ship , and these are federal seamen . By what right do you dare preach of imminent death ? - Of meek resignation to the inevitable ? - Captain , I ... Nothing is inevitable , except defeat for those who give up without a fight ! Keep your philosophies to yourself . Now get forward , and stay away from my men . As you wish , Captain . Carry on . Lee ! Please , don 't do it ! Come in . Yes , Cap 'n ? - Still upset about that news blackout ? - As a matter of fact , I am , sir . And this man Alvarez is trying to subvert the crew . To meet your deadline , I need fighters , not fatalists . Then order Alvarez to keep away from the crew . I 've already done that . But , if I might suggest , sir , it would help if you 'd treat the crew as men . Let them in on your plans . That is my intention , Captain , but at the proper time . - Sparks . - Sír ? - What luck with Washington ? - Statíc 's gettíng worse , sír . That Míamí píckup was just a freak . Now all contact 's blacked out . Very well . - Now what ? You can 't reach the president ... - I haven 't given up . - But the radio ... - Where are we now , Cap 'n ? - Sir ? - Just exactly where are we ? - We 're right here , sir . - Good . Set a course close in toward Cape de São Roque . May I ask why , sir ? Static may knock out radio , but it won 't affect a telephone cable . - Telephone cable ? - Yes , Lucius . Right here . Our mine detectors should locate it , where it crosses the continental shelf . Have Engineering rig a tapping device . - Then tap the cable ? - If we can 't reach the president by radio , we 'll tap the cable and phone him - over the Rio to London telephone cable . I like that , Harry . Thank you . - Check your mask . - Right . Check . - I thought I asked for volunteers . - That 's right . - A little out of character , aren 't you ? - Undersea work was part of my job . All right , let 's move out . - All clear ? - Clear ! Secure the hatch . - Hatch secure . - Prepare to flood . - Ready here . - Dívers ready . Slow flood . Slow flood . - Let 's hope this works . - I wouldn 't count on it . - There 's the signal . They 've found it . - Where ? Right out there . - Get Sparks . - I can 't see anything but the signal . Stand by , Sparks . They 've located the cable . Should be a connection in a minute . Aye aye , sír . Connectíon made , Admíral . Hello ? Hello , this is submarine Seavíew . Can anybody hear us ? Hello ? Something 's coming in . - Can you hear us ? - Thís ís London . Hello ? - Thís ís London speakíng . - Can you hear me , London ? This is submarine Seavíew - Admiral Nelson . I hear you , Seavíew . Go ahead . Could you patch me through to Washington ? Hello ? Hello ? Come in , London . Sorry , sír , not a chance . We 've been out of contact wíth the States for 35 hours . There 's no answer on eíther the north or south cables . Harry , we 'll never get through . Can you relay a call through the telephone satellite ? Lmpossíble . The whole system 's flooded out . London 's been evacuated and ... Hello ? Hello ? Come in , London . Are you there ? Hello ? Break the connection , Sparks . - Order that last man in . - Aye aye , sír . Lee ? Oh , Lee , am I glad to see you ! Am I glad to see you ! - Well , Doc ? - No ribs broken . You 're very fortunate . He 's all right . It was a ... Thanks . It was a perfect shot . Saved my life . My hand was guided by the Lord . Perhaps . But I 'm glad fatalism didn 't run its course . Lee ! I 'm sorry , that was uncalled for . Thanks . This will have to be seen to . Doctor . - Hm . Bring him to sick bay . - Please come this way . - How are you , Romano ? - In the pink , Captain . - Good . - You had me worried . - I had myself worried . - Lee , are you all right ? Well , I 'm still in one piece . What 's the news , Admiral ? Disastrous . For all they know , there isn 't any Washington . No London either . What do we do now ? Let 's get the ship under way . Then have the crew stand by for an announcement . Aye aye , sir . Lucius , I 'm about to make the most important decision of my life , and I 'd like you there . - Connors . - Yes , sir . - Sparks ? - Sír ? - Pipe this through the ship . - Aye aye , sír . Ready , sír . Now hear this . Men , this is a time for decision . You heard the tragíc news over the cable : Contact wíth Washíngton ís now ímpossíble . Thís means we can 't get presídentíal approval of my plan . Therefore , the final decísíon must be made now . There are only two choíces . So , wíth hígher dírectíves unavaílable , and by the authoríty vested ín me , I have made that final decísíon . We are headed for the Maríanas to fire the míssíle . Now ít 's a race agaínst tíme , a countdown of only 14 days ín whích to cross half the world . If we are to wín that race - and we must - sacrifíces wíll become daíly oblígatíons . The new work schedule wíll be posted ímmedíately , and I tell you now , ít 's a rough one . Just one thíng more . Our world faces its darkest hour . But I am convinced that , with God 's help , my plan will succeed , and the world will survive . That is all . - Doctor ? - Captain . - Just checking on Alvarez . - He went forward with the doctor . Seems OK . I wish I could say the same of some of the others . - George Young . - Mm-hm . I 've given him a sedative . Nervous hysteria . After all , Doctor , he just became a new father . And it 's only his second trip . It 's not a question of experience . Here 's a veteran - your engineer , Lieutenant Hodges . Lieutenant . What seems to be your problem , Mr Hodges ? I just don 't feel good , sir . I 'll be OK in an hour or so . You try and get some rest . We 'll manage . Yes , sir . - What happened to him ? - Same thing . Hyperneurasthenia . Your crew is like a capped oil well . When tension builds up , there 's an explosion . - But these are handpicked men ! - With eyes to see and minds that question . Oh , they know the world 's probably on the brink of oblivion , but instead of trying to get to their homes and families , here they are , racing under the sea , driven on by one man 's wild scheme , which has no proven scientific basis . Doctor , this is a submarine , not a nursery school . - And the admiral 's orders must be obeyed . - I wonder . Professionally , I want to know if the admiral always behaves this way , - this ruthless compulsion that ... - Doctor . Doctor . Excuse me . - Where are we ? - Sub 's right here , skipper . We ought to reach the ... - Engine room , what happened ? - The generator 's gone out , sír . - How bad ? - We 're checkíng . - All stop . - All stop , sir . - What is it ? - The generator . They 're checking it . - It 's an armature , Captaín . - How long to fix ? - Ten hours . - We can 't afford to wait ten hours ! Radar and sonar are both knocked out . We can 't move without ' em . We can . The motors are OK . As for sonar and radar , these are safe waters . Keep moving and rush those repairs . That 's an order , Cap 'n . - All ahead two-thirds . - Ahead two-thirds . Now get on those repairs - on the double ! Hello . You startled me ! It 's so dark in here . I 'm sorry . Well , I 'm the one that 's sorry . I didn 't thank you for saving Lee . That was a very brave thing you did , risking your life to save his . We 'll all die when our time comes . You really believe the world is coming to an end . Yes , I do . I had time to think about it , out there on the ice . At first , I was puzzled . But then I began to see things clearly . As a child , I was pledged to the Church . But my mind was filled with doubts - enough to make me turn my back on my chosen path . But out there , the fire burned away my doubts and I saw the truth , crystal clear in my mind and in my heart . - And I found peace again . - And resignation . Has a man a right to even try to oppose God 's will ? - Why should God want to destroy us ? - Haven 't we tried to destroy ourselves ? I don 't agree with anything you say . I won 't ! It doesn 't matter . Perhaps our death comes even sooner than the others . Mines ! Lee ! Mines ! Mines , dead ahead ! - Hundreds of mínes ! - All stop ! Take over . Aye aye , sir . It 's caught in the searchlight casing , sir . - All back . Dead slow . - All back . Dead slow . - Hold it ! All stop ! - All stop . We 've got to clear it from the outside . - Frogmen . - No . We 're too deep . Use the minisub and a torch . Burn through the cable . - A minisub on all these mines ? ! - Can you think of a better idea ? I could two hours ago when I suggested we wait for repairs ! You made your point . The responsibility is now mine . Aye aye , sir . Harry , take it easy . This is the captain . We 're in the middle of a minefield . A cable is caught on the forward searchlight . I need two volunteers for the mínísub . Gleason , sir . I 'll go . - Ríght , Gleason . - OK , Red . Here 's your chance for thatjoyride . Smith , sir . Count on me . - Right , Smith . - Hey , that 's young Jimmy . Now this is a pretty touchy situation , so play it cool . Aye aye , sir . - Aye aye , sir . - Good luck . Damage Patrol ! Stand by ! What are your orders now , sir ? Back out of the minefield , dead slow , then proceed with caution until the generator is fixed . Aye aye , sir . All back . Dead slow . Are you all right , sir ? Huh ? Yes . Yes , of course , Connors . Perfectly all right . Are you , Harry ? Gleason was a good man . So was young Smith . Little Jimmy . Look , you have no right to brood , Harry . You had to take a gamble , otherwise your entire plan would have been wrecked ! He 's right , sir . If the generator hadn 't ... - You 're both very kind . Thank you . - " Kind " ! No one is being ... Hey ! That 's pretty good , isn 't it ? Only about six hours . What do you say , Connors ? - What 's that ? - Nothing important . It seems that somebody 's concerned about my health and welfare . Yes ? Thís ís the Captaín . Please come to the síck bay , sír , at once . - Very well . - Now what ? Let 's find out . Come along , Connors . Hodges ? He smashed in the medicine chest to swallow these , Admiral . He must have typed that note on my machine . " I was to blame for the death of Gleason and Smith . " " I sabotaged the generator " ! " Although only God knows why I did this terrible thing . " - Sabotage ... - He wasn 't responsible , Admiral . It was a severe nervous breakdown . That 's beside the point , Doctor . All right , Captain . You blamed me for the death of Gleason and Smith , but here is positive proof that those men were victims , not of my impatience , but of deliberate sabotage . Any comments ? Yes , sir . Sabotage might be just the beginning . You 're driving my crew to the point of exhaustion , possibly even rebellion . These are men , not machines ! If they break down , we 'll never meet your deadline . We 'll meet it because we have to meet it . I 'm not worried that your men can 't take it . They can . But I am concerned about your alternative - rebellion . I found this note in my cabin , just a few minutes ago . " If you continue your lunatic project , you 'll never live to see it completed . " Hodges 'll never see it completed . He won 't bother you anymore . I 'm not so sure that he did . These notes were not typed on the same machine . Double the security guard . All men off duty restricted to quarters . Until proved otherwise , everyone is suspect . - Lee ? Don 't turn against the admiral . - I 'm not turning against anybody . Oh , Lee , let 's not argue . Please ? Not now . Lieutenant ? There ís something you can do to help . Take this note sent to the admiral . Run a test sample on all the typewriters . I don 't have to . The dot 's off the small í - this was typed on my machine . - In the admiral 's office , Cathy ? - Yes . - Captain , may I speak freely ? - Please do . You 're so concerned for your crew , you 're overlooking other danger signs . Admiral Nelson 's becoming a textbook case . Taciturnity , combined with anxiety , high irritability , - and now , perhaps , delusions of persecution . - Delusions ? The admiral could have typed that threatening note . - Susan ! How can you consider such a thing ? - Cathy . Thanks very much for your diagnosis , Dr Hiller . The admiral ís showing signs of strain ... However , I 'm sure he 's in command of his senses . I hope so . We still have a long way to go . Fire in the admiral 's cabin ! Lee ! The admiral 's cabin ! - Step up the air in the ventilators ! - Lee ! Lee ! It 's not smoke . Look up here . It 's gas ! Surface ! Surface ! Ship off the port side , sir . Glasses . Looks becalmed . On the ship ! Do you read me ? Do you read me ? On the ship ! Do you read me ? Shall I send out a boat , sir ? We can 't proceed until we ventilate anyway . Very well . Rescue team , up and out on the double . Check forward . Check aft . Let 's go . Dead . They 're all dead ! Let 's go . - What 'd you see out there ? - Dead men . Dead men on a dead ship . - Ain 't it about time we went home ? - Yeah . You 've all got families , haven 't you ? - Well ? How about it ? - All right , leave it to me . - Yes , Lieutenant ? - It 's a complete derelict , sir . Just four days out of Honolulu . Everyone 's dead - the heat , no water ... We found this in the bar . It 's The Hawaíían Tímes . It 's dated last Thursday . I 've been asked to speak for some of the crew , sir . - What is it , Kowski ? - We 've been feeling this way for days , but ... Well , I guess that dead ship brought it to a head . - Brought what to a head ? - Sir , the men feel , if it 's the end coming , they ought to be spending their last hours with their wives and families . Now we respectfully demand , sir , that you take us back home . I see . Well , may I remind all of you that this is a government ship . Demands made by a crewman or an officer could be considered mutiny . Shall I so consider it ? - Well , speak up ! - Captain ... As a civilian , may I say a word ? The world may end at any minute now . At such a time , these men have a right to choose where to die and with whom . - Listen ... - Just a minute , Captain . Mr Alvarez makes a valid point . I do not believe the world is ending . If I did , I 'd be heading for home myself . But in fairness to everyone , there is some recent news that may have a bearing on your decision . It comes from a Honolulu newspaper , found on the derelict yacht . The headline reads " World Subs Ordered To Stop Seavíew From Firing Missile . " So , in addition to all our other problems , we are now a hunted ship , and we may never get a chance to fire the missile . This in no way alters my plans . This ship will hold its course . But , in view of this news and , uh , your request , the men who want to go home may do so , on that yacht . I think you 're fools to try it , but I 'll supply sufficient water and food to give you a fighting chance . Admiral , if we 're to meet your deadline to the Marianas , it 's madness to split this crew . - In view of the threat of mutiny ... - It 's not mutiny yet . Your challenge was not taken up by the men . Our trouble stems from the fanatical desire on the part of some of them to go home . I 'd rather have a small crew than risk further sabotage . - Admiral ... - Enough , Captain . Men , you have 15 minutes to make your decision . Please have any in the sick bay that want to go placed aboard the yacht . One of you doctors better go along . The other , stay . Dr Jamieson , I would say that this looks like ajob for you . - Yes , sir . - Get the supplies rolling , Cap 'n . Excuse me . - All clear on deck ! - Very well . Captain , take her down . - Take her down . 100 feet . - 100 feet . Flood negative . - Are you all right , Admiral ? - Perfectly all right , thanks to Crane . Well , Mr Alvarez , I see you decided to stay with us . Stay or go , what 's the difference ? What 's to be will be . - That guy gets on my nerves . - Cheerful , isn 't he ? Stern 's under . Deck 's awash . - Full speed ahead , Cap 'n . - One moment , sir . Lieutenant , I ask you take official note of my protest against the admiral 's actions . - Actions ? - Yes , sir . Despite my objection , you encouraged desertion . I can 't argue with that . You 're within your rights to record a protest . But , Lieutenant , you can also record this . Desertion or not , we 're better off without a murderer on board . The note I found was no idle warning . That fire in my cabin was deliberately set . Begging your pardon , sir . Romano . Fire detail found a cigar burning on the floor , sir . - Meaning I was smoking in bed ? - Apparently , sir . " Apparently , sir " ? Except , I ran out of cigars before I went to bed . Lieutenant , file the captain 's report , then have my cabin cleaned up . I 'm going to check supplies . For more cigars . Delusions are typical in cases like this . - I 'll be in my quarters . - Aye aye , sir . Yes ? Hi . Buy you a cup of coffee ? - Look , Lee , I ... - Now , wait . Waitjust a minute . I appreciate your blind loyalty to the admiral . I felt that way too , until his lunatic actions began to follow a pattern . - " Lunatíc actions " ? - All right , is this rational ? No search for survivors on Ice Floe Delta . Crash-dived in New York with police on deck . Sent a minisub into a minefield , killing two of my men . - Well , he had to take the chance ... - Drove a fine officer to sabotage and suicide . Produced a threatening note , probably written by himself . Then he dreamed up a murder attempt , which was his smoking in bed ! - I believe him . - And now he approves of desertion , when we desperately need every able-bodied man on this sub . - Lord knows what he 'll do next . - Or what you 'll do next . Is that it ? " Procedure under which a subordinate officer may relieve a superior of his command . " - That 's just in case . - Of what ? I decide the admiral is irresponsible . Irresponsible ? ! So what are you going to do about the missile ? It has to be fired . Why ? If the admiral 's crazy , his plan is crazy , too . The UN thought so . They 've got subs out looking for us . Well , Professor Emery believes in it ! I 'm sorry , but until I say so , the matter 's closed . Sir . Less than eight degrees to Dr Zucco 's burnout point . 165 ... Well , let 's hope he 's right . Hang it up . - What 's our position ? - Guam 's due south of us , sir . Just 12 miles to target . - Yes ? - This is the captain . - We 're 12 míles and 50 mínutes to zero . - Missile ready for firing ? - All ready , sír . - I 'll speak to the ship . - Sparks ! Pipe the admiral through the ship . - Aye aye , sir . Go ahead , sír . This is the admiral . The missile is primed , and in exactly 49 minutes it will be fired . Shortly thereafter , we should know if our long voyage across the world has been justifíed . With luck , we 'll soon be on our way home . That is all . - Connors , we 're all out of aspirin here . - Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . I 'll get some . - Susan , where 's the aspirin ? - Top drawer over there . Thank you . - Lucius , what happened to you ? ! - Oh , nothing . Got too close to one of my sharks . You know Bessie . - Will he be all right , Doctor ? - It 's not serious , Admiral . I thought Bessie was a friend of y ... - Lieutenant , you should be on duty . - Not me , sir . I 'm beat . - Aren 't we all ? Get forward . - Sorry , sir . As a sick man , I take my orders from the doctor . Sick ? In my judgment , you 're faking . With due respect , sir , yourjudgment 's been rocky lately . Why , you goldbricking pipsqueak ! What brought that on ? - Come on , tell him . - I don 't know , uh ... What do you mean , you don 't know ? Tell him . First the doctor tells me to rest , then the admiral orders me back to duty , then ... pow ! Doctor , I request you certify the admiral as irresponsible - if you agree . - What ? - I certainly do , Captain . Master-at-arms ? Sick bay , on the double ! Hold it , sir . It was all my fault . I was disrespectful . - Captain , you can 't arrest the admiral . - Of course not . Any other decision would be dangerous for everybody . That missile 's scheduled to be fired at four o 'clock . Are you still going to permit this ? I guarantee the admiral 's plan is sound . Dr Zucco and our finest scientific minds don 't agree . - Dr Zucco ... - I 'm going to warn him . Lieutenant . Confine yourself to your quarters . That 's an order . Follow me . Yes ? Dr Hiller , it 's the admiral . Is the captain still there ? He 's just gone forward , Admíral . Sir . Sir , I deeply regret this , but under federal regulation 249 , governíng conduct on the hígh seas , I am forced to relieve you of your command . - Arrest ? - Not arrest , sir . I 'm placing you on sick list . - And if I refuse ? - I 'm afraid you have no choice . I must also inform you I 've decided not to fire the missile . - Lee ... - Most of the scientists agree the fire will burn itself out at 173 degrees . I 'll wait and see . You must fire the míssíle at 4 : 00 or we lose the angle of trajectory ! - Detail ! - Captaín , thís ís Sonar . Unidentified fast propellers bearing 090 , about 2,000 yards astern . They 've found us . Torpedo approachíng to starboard ! Left full rudder ! Battle stations ! Take off . Sparks , contact that sub and tell them we 're not firing the missile . Sonar ! Switch pickup into the PA . - Battle stations ! Battle stations ! - Battle stations ! Move ! Phew ! Too close . - Sparks , can 't you reach that sub ? - There 's no answer , sír . - Rig for attack ! Ready torpedoes ! - No , no ! We can 't fire on a UN sub . We 've got to make a run for it . Torpedoes approaching starboard ! Left full rudder . - We 're a sitting duck . Dive ! - I 'm giving orders on this ship . I 'm not challenging that , but I built this ship ! We can take the pressure of the Mariana Trench . That sub can 't . Dive , Lee . Dive , for heaven 's sake ! Dive ! Dive ! Dive ! Dive ! - 400 feet . - 400 . 600 . 800 . - 1200 feet . - 1200 . - 1400 feet . - 1400 . - 2300 feet . - 2300 . 2400 . - 2500 feet . - 2500 . - Torpedoes approaching port side ! - Right full rudder ! Fools ! They 'd better get up fast . - 3,200 feet . - She 'll blow ! All stop ! Check for damage . Damage Patrol , make checks ! Fire detail ! On the double ! - Return to stations . - Return to stations ! - Full emergency power ! - Full emergency power ! All full ! Cap 'n , we 're picking up something else - real close . - Well , it can 't be another sub . - Not at this depth . Lee ! What the ... ? ! Power room ! Reactors up full ! Shoot a charge through the hull . Aye aye , sír . It must give way . - Full emergency power ! - Full emergency power ! It 's breaking loose ! That did it , Lee . - All ahead full . - All ahead full . Now what happened ? Power room . Power room . - Power room ! Power room ! - No answer ? Negative . Control room . What happened to the reactors ? - Don 't know , sír . They just quít . - I 'll find out myself . If you píck up a fatal dose of radíatíon , ít glows red . You gotta stop the admíral . He 'll destroy the world . Doctor ! What were you doing in there ? Making sure you don 't reach your target position by 4 : 00 . So you were the saboteur ! - Control room ! Switch to auxiliary - fast ! - Aye aye , sír . Movíng on batteríes , sír . - Very well . What 's the temperature reading ? - 173.2 , and the fire 's stíll burníng . I knew it . Zucco was wrong . There was no burnout point . - Stand by to fire . - Aye aye , sír . Sail camera , prepare to track missile . Saíl camera on . Míssíle room , stand by . Number eíght tube . - Standíng by . - Target posítíon , ten mínutes . Thís ís the míssíle room . Hatch openíng now . We made it , Alvarez . We 'll fire that missile on time . I think not , Admiral . - Alvarez ! - No man has a right to challenge God 's will . Have you gone completely mad ? ! Put down that bomb ! Man has sown the seeds of sin . Now he will reap the whirlwind . Everybody stand still . Lieutenant , get away from the missile button . Don 't move , Admiral . Hold it ! Attention , everyone . This is Alvarez . I have a bomb . - A bomb ? ! - If anybody tríes to fire the míssíle , I 'll blow up the shíp . Captaín Crane , wherever you are , see that no one ínterferes . - Cathy . - Commodore , where 's Lee ? Come on . We have no time to lose . We must find him . Oh ! Lee ! What 's the matter ? Hey , what 's the matter , my boy ? - What happened ? - Alvarez has a bomb . He 's holding the ship at bay . We 've only got a few minutes , and the missile 's got to be fired . Alvarez is covering the control room . - There must be some other way . - You go to your quarters . Only eight more minutes , Admiral , and it will be too late for you to do anything . Diving gear . On the double ! - Which hatch is open ? - Number eight , sir , just under the bridge . Alvarez , for heaven 's sake , man , come to your senses ! - If the missile isn 't fired in six minutes , we ... - It won 't be . God 's will is written across the heavens . Alvarez , are you saying that man must accept destruction , even though it 's in his power to avert it ? It 's not for us to judge , Admiral . Freeze ! Not to judge , maybe . But we can reason . If God ordains that man should die without a fight , then why does he give us the will to live ? Your time 's run out , Admiral . This is the admiral . Surface ! Surface ! Surface ! Surface ! - You did it . - Lucius , we did it . Admiral , sir ? - Lieutenant . - Thank you , sir . - Good luck , lad . - Thank you . - Lucius ... - Admiral . Lee . - Full speed for home , Lee . - Aye aye , sir . Visiontext Subtitles : Stephanie Donohue US ENGLISH

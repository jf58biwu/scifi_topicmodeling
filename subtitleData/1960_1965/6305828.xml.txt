 Somewhere in the forbidding tundra mountains of Lapland high above the Arctic Circle , a group of mining engineers were prospecting for copper . That 's it ! But what they unearthed was a story , a story that was to terrorize the whole world . When events began that were to place a burden of decision involving the lives of an entire city on my shoulders , I was far away , unsuspecting , unknowing . Hold it ! It 's blood . What are we stopping for ? There 's blood on the drill . Okay , turn it off ! It 's a piece of skin , like leather . Bones ? Fossil bones . What kind of thing is down there ? I don 't know . But I intend to find out . Alex , get the generator going . I want to use the radio . Okay . You 'll suspend the drilling until I find out what this is all about . If there 's any copper down there , it 'll have to wait . Henry , as an American , you have drilled all over the world . Would do you make of it ? It can 't be a living thing . Let it be . There 's got to be some explanation . Well , it 's out of our line . I 'm going to radio Narvik , the University of Copenhagen . We 'll need a paleontologist . I wonder if even they can find the answer . We 'll find out soon enough . Get the Polaroid . We 'll get ourselves some pictures right away . Okay on the radio , Svend . - Got it ? - Sure . Come on then , let 's get on that radio . Within hours , two Danish scientists had joined the mining engineers , Professor Martens from Copenhagen 's Danmarks Aquarium and his associate Dr. Peter Dalby as well as a third man , Hans Carlson , a newspaper reporter . The two scientists had examined the startling find hidden beneath the frozen tundra and brought up by the drill bit . They 'd reasoned out the meaning of the gruesome puzzle without ever dreaming of its full deadly secret . Actually , what we have is easily explained . Our test borings show that the fossil bones of some large creature lie buried close beneath the surface . Yes , but how do you explain the tissue , the blood ? Dr. Dalby and I have discussed that . There 's a streak of icy muck underground . The creature must be embedded in it , frozen solid . Not unusual , really . Fully preserved mammoths and other animals have been discovered under the same conditions , most of them in Siberia . But the piece we found in the core sample wasn 't frozen . Neither was the blood . Your drill apparently bit through the frozen part of the creature . The heat of the friction thawed it out , and you got your blood . Mm-hmm , makes sense . Then there 's really nothing exciting about this at all . - Ah , quite the contrary . - Oh ? You see , all the animals discovered until now were mammals , but the piece of skin you brought up and the apparent size of the beast convinced us that this one is a reptile . A giant reptile ? Precisely , and that is unique . Tomorrow we will start to excavate and ship everything to the Denmark aquarium of Copenhagen where we have the facilities for study . All right , all right , Lisa , we 'll find a spot - for your funny Mr. Peters . - Thank you , father . You 'll need a watchman now anyway with Svend 's fossils here . Don 't spend all your time with those old fossils , father . You might become one . With two daughters like you and Carol , it 's a pleasure to retire to my old bones . Good morning , Dr. Martens . Good day . Good morning , professor . Good day . Good morning . Good day . Here is the latest list of bone fragments , Dr. Dalby . Thank you . Peter , are you still trying to master that jigsaw puzzle ? I tell you , Otto , I won 't give up . It 's got to be done . But it is useless . Reconstruction is impossible . I don 't know why . We 've certainly got enough bones to work with . Too many . We aren 't even sure that all of them belong to the same animal . lam . But it would be unlike any other fossil creature ever found . Father , just received a telegram at home . I thought it was important , so I brought it right over . Oh . It 's from that Svend from Lapland . Oh ? He has found more bones about 600 meters away . He is bringing them here . He arrives in one hour . Good . Karen , pick him up at the airport . Is he handsome , Father ? No , he has three eyes and a false mustache . Hurry now . I don 't want him to wait . How will I know him ? Since when must I tell you how to find a man ? Please bring him directly here . Perhaps these will be the bones we need to solve your problem . I have never seen bone fragments like this before . Well , what 's so unusual about the bones ? They are resilient but very strong . They are almost like the cartilaginous bones of a shark . What about that frozen piece ? We have freed it from the muck . Looks like the tip of the creature 's tail . Here . We are keeping it frozen , of course . Take a good look . From the size of that piece , we have calculated that the whole creature must have been gigantic . How big would you say ? In a class with the largest of prehistoric creatures , 90 feet or more . A giant dinosaur . Peter , we have an absolutely unique find here . Mm-hmm . A perfectly preserved specimen of a reptile ... 70 , maybe 100 millions years old . Let 's forget all about the bones and concentrate on this . Father , now that your certain that Svend knows about frozen matters , can I thaw him a little and show him around ? You must stay with us while you are here . We have an extra room . How long can you stay ? Father , here 's Mr. Peterson . He 's all set . Karen . Please don 't frighten that young man . You know , she is really quite dangerous . But don 't worry . I 'll go along as your chaperone . Otto , I envy that young man . Yes , he will be busy now . Oh , yes . Oh , good , I 'm glad you could make it , Peterson . - Dr. Dalby . - Glad to see you . Mr. Peterson is going to help us keep an eye on things . He will be staying here . I felt there must be someone here when we are not around . Good idea . Sure , anything fishy going on , I 'll look into it . Thank you , Peterson . Thank you . Dr. Dalby will tell you what your duties are later . One of the most important things , Mr. Peterson , is this freezing room . It must be kept at this temperature at all times . Sure , Doctor . It 's run electrically . I 'll show you where the machinery is later . Sure thing . In the meantime , why don 't you get settled ? I 'll do that . " Electric eel . " Hmm . Hello ? Hello ? Yep , everything around here runs on electricity . Oh , Peterson ? Just doing my rounds , Doctor . I 'm going to be working most of the night . I 'll look after things here . Okay . Good night , Doctor . Good night , Peterson . And your Mr. Peterson is inspecting everything . That 's what I told you , father . - Oh , yes , yes , I know . - He 's so curious . Yes , you must- - Dr. Dalby . Oh ! Something 's happened . Peter ? Peter ! What happened ? Oh , I must have dozed off . Oh , Dr. Dalby , you really scared me so much . Father . Unfrozen . Completely thawed . Ruined . Where is that Peterson ? Let me get my hands on him . It isn 't Peterson 's fault , Otto . I sent him away . The fault is mine . You realize what you have done , Peter . The tissues are completely thawed out . Decomposition must already have begun . Even if we refreeze it , the tissues will never be the same . Father ? Dr. Dalby ? Look at the wound . It- - it looks different , doesn 't it ? It 's healing . Otto ! Look at the surface here . Granulation . You realize what this means ? You let it thaw ... and now ... it is alive . Welcome , Miss Miller . We are not accustomed to see such a beautiful woman connected with science . I assure you , Professor Martens , I am quite capable in my field . No insult , Miss Miller . No insult . As an old man , I feel free to accept beauty without apology . I guess I 'm a little sensitive , Professor . I hope , Miss Miller , you will enjoy your stay here . I 'm here for a job , Professor . UNESCO appreciates your invitation . If all that your report detailed can be verified , it certainly opens up dangerous avenues of exploration . We have another representative of the United Nations coming here , a countrymen of yours , a general . His name is , uh ... Grayson . Brigadier General Mark Grayson . We are pleased to have you , General . Our little Denmark is not used to being so honored . I don 't know why I 'm here , Professor . I assume you 'll let me know . Yes , General . As a matter of fact , we have a news conference and demonstration for the press in a few minutes . I think many of your questions will be answered . But let me introduce you . This is Miss Miller from UNESCO . American , Miss Miller ? Yes , General . How do you do ? This is my daughter , Lisa . I 'm pleased to meet you , General . I hope you will enjoy your stay . Thank you , Miss Martens , but I believe the shorter the stay , the happier for me . No offense meant . And so , ladies and gentlemen , you have been invited here to see for yourselves one of the most amazing events ever to take place in the annals ... General Grayson , this is Captain Brandt of the Royal Danish Guard . He has been assigned as your liaison while you are here . It 's a pleasure to welcome you , General . Thanks , but let 's listen to Martens . Ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt it is alive ... and rapidly growing . Already it has more than doubled its size . It lies in a tank in that room . The tank has a controlled flow of nutrient fluids . It is , in effect , a kind of regeneration incubator . Professor Martens , would you explain exactly what regeneration is ? Regeneration is ability of living tissue to heal itself or repair an injury . In some animals , this ability is far advanced . We are all familiar with the fact that a common lizard can lose his tail and grow a new one . A starfish will regrow an entire new organism from each one of its separate arms . And a flatworm can be cut into many pieces , and each separate piece will regenerate itself into a complete animal , including such complicated organs as its brain , eyes , and digestive system . And that , ladies and gentlemen , is what is going on in that tank . What do you call the thing ? Mm , we don 't know what it will grow into yet , outside the fact it 's reptilian . How about reptilicus martentious ? " Reptilicus " is good enough . Reptilicus it is . And now , ladies and gentlemen , if you would like to have a look in the tank , please follow me . " The UN has placed all of its scientific knowledge at the disposal of the Danish government . And General Mark Grayson , well known for his exploits at the Battle of the Bulge , has been placed in command of the protective forces . " General Mark Grayson in command of two captains , three office boys , and a damn lizard . Ow ! Ooh ! Mom ! Help ! Something 's happened . Everything 's all right , Peterson . What ? But- - but I heard it move . Yes , I 'm sure you did , but Reptilicus has no conscious life , not yet . What you heard was merely an involuntary embryonic movement . Uh , sure . You- - you 're right . Good , Peterson . If ever anything happens , just let us know . Okay . Okay . It seems to be totally unlike any other known dinosaur . The huge bony scales along its back are incredibly thick . The legs are hardly formed as yet . There is a slimy secretion from glands in his maw . It has a burning , corrosive effect like strong acid . Dr. Dalby has recommended that the flow of nutrients be increased . We will try it . However , if Reptilicus grows much bigger , we will have to build a new tank . Come in . Is there anything I can do for you ? Yeah , get me transferred out of this damn place . I think , General , if you just visit the city , you might learn to like it . I took Captain Brandt 's suggestion . He was right , I needed a change of pace , and I persuaded Connie to go along . It was a bright move . She was a charming companion . Look , Mark , the little mermaid . How lovely . - It is a beautiful city . - Yes , it is . There 's the King 's Castle , Amalienborg . And the Royal Guard . What a beautiful fountain . That 's the goddess Gefion plowing Denmark out of the Scandinavian Peninsula , according to legend . Look at that traffic . So many bicycles . They say the Danes are born on bicycles . I know , and then thrown into the water to learn to swim . - That 's Langebro , isn 't it ? - Right . By the way , I asked Brandt to meet us later . Fine . We 'll go to dinner at Tivoli . Tivoli Night Oh , what a sight All of Copenhagen is dancing Laughter and light Come hold me tight This is a place for romancing Down by the lake , lovers dream to a song Like they were doing when Grandma was young Tivoli night Tivoli light Life is entrancing when we 're romancing Dancing in Tivoli You 're all dressed up and with a smile on your face You look as gay as can be Soon you 'll be going to a wonderful place You 've got a date there , my honey With me Tivoli night Oh , what a sight All Copenhagen is dancing Laugher and light Come hold me tight This is a place for romancing Down by the lake , lovers dream to a song Like they were doing when Grandma was young Tivoli night Life is so bright Lanterns are gleaming when we are dreaming Dancing in Tivoli Dancing in Tivoli Hello ? ! Hello ! Hello ! Peterson ! Peterson ! Peterson , go directly to the police and bring them back immediately ! Olsen ! Olsen ! It 's alive ! It 's loose ! Come in , Peterson . Come on , we have to get there as fast as possible . Oh , now see what you 've done . - I 'm sorry . - What 's all this about , Peterson ? - What happened ? - The electricity went out all over . - All over . - Yeah , even the electric eel . Then what ? Then it was so dark , I couldn 't see my own face in front of me . I wish I could be that lucky , Mr. Peterson . And what happened then ? There was only a big hole left . The monster is loose ! Yeah , sure , sure , sure , sure . Why don 't you go and tell Dr. Dalby about it ? I can 't ! He sent me here to tell you ! Why , sure . Dr. Dalby ? They found no trace of him . What happened ? Reptilicus must- - must have developed in a spurt of growth . He came out of his dormant stage . How could it happen ? I don 't know . Maybe the electrical-charged air of the thunderstorm . Maybe the increased nutrient flow . I just don 't know . We found his tracks . They lead down to the water ... and disappear . All right , Captain . We have a fight on our hands . I want to set up a base of operations in the city . Where do you suggest ? The barracks of the Royal guard . Area F , area F report , over . This is field headquarters , A sector . All units report . All units report . Over . Company B in position . - O sector out . Over . - No , there 'll be no need . Company A , position B sector . Out . All right , gentlemen . You all have your orders . I 'll work with the Army through Captain Brandt . Commander Svenson , you 'll stand by for any naval action required . Mr. Hassing , as chief of police , I 'll rely on you to handle the population . Professor Martens will act as scientific and technical advisor . Any questions ? Carry on , gentlemen . Brandt , I want that radio manned 24 hours a day . Right . General Grayson . Where ? ! Stay out of his way ! We 're leaving at once ! - Brandt , red alert . - Where ? Small farm on the coast . What happened ? 14 of them . 14 of my best cows . Did you see it ? Huge . It was huge . It destroyed my barn and went on . That area , has it been sectored ? - Yes . - All right , we 'll surround it , comb it . If he 's in there , we 'll get him . You 'd better get everybody out of here in case he comes back . Control , control , this is Brandt . Entering E sector , over . This is control . We 'll rendezvous E sector , area four , over and out . Come on , Svend , let 's go . Cars number seven and nine , follow me . The others , go that way . Come on . Mark , look over there . We 'll turn this way . Control , control , this is Brandt ! We found it ! - It 's ... My God ... Come on , Svend , get going ! Machine gun in position there ! Attention all units ! Get your field pieces into action ! Spread out ! Hit him from all sides ! Fire when ready ! Give him everything you 've got ! Be ready to get out of here in a hurry . Cease fire ! Cease fire ! We didn 't even dent him . Those bony scales are like armor plate . It 's headed for the beach We 'll need a lot more firepower . If that 'll do it . Wait ... there 's another way . Can we get to the beach before he does ? We can sure try . Report to Captain Brandt ! Brandt , come in . We beat him down here . He can 't be far away . Are you sure this is where he 'd come out ? Yes , if he kept on going toward the beach . There he is ! Come on ! Come on ! Where is that equipment ? ! Mark ... He 's returned to the sea , sounding like a wounded whale . Maybe he was hurt enough . Maybe he will die . Not a chance . He 's just taken off to let his wounds heal . Regeneration ? In a little while , he 'll be as good as new . Then Reptilicus is a cross between one of these and an amphibious reptile . More than that . Nature went through a long period of experimentation some 70 million years ago . Gentleman , I believe Reptilicus is one of nature 's attempts to bridge the step from reptile to mammal . Whatever he is , we have to destroy him . But first he must be found . That 's not going to be easy as long as he stays underwater . He is not essentially a sea creature . He must come up to breathe occasionally . Professor Martens , I understand the aquarium has a motor launch that is equipped with a special closed-circuit television system . We do . We use it to observe the sea bottom . I 'd like to install that equipment on one of the naval patrol boats . Yes , sir . I suggest you concentrate on the waters around here . Why ? If he isn 't here now , I 'm certain he will return . You see , in a way , this is his birthplace ... his home . Instinct will draw him . All right . We 're counting on you to find him for us . Anything ? Almost a week now . Why don 't you go home ? Take it easy for a while . I 'll stay with you . You 're a stubborn guy . Other people are stubborn . I 'm firm . Bridge , unidentified object on bottom . Check your screen . Wilco and out . Look there . This is Neilson calling . Reptilicus cited in shallow water . Standing by for orders . Commander Nielsen 's calling , sir . Put it on the PA . I repeat- - Reptilicus sighted in shallow water . Standing by for orders . This is Nielsen calling . This is Grayson . Execute plan A. Execute plan A. Come to course 2-5-0 . Signal attack run . Go get him , Nielsen ! Wilco and out . Forward battery fire ! Second battery fire ! - Mark ! - What is it ? They aren 't bombing him . Of course . We 'll get him this time , blow him bits . No , don 't you realize what you 're doing ? Not now , Connie . Stay out of this . Take me out to- - Second battery , fire ! If Reptilicus should be hit , you 'll never find all the pieces underwater . He can regenerate , Mark . Commander , this is Grayson . Break off the attack ! Cease fire ! Break off ! Break off ! Attack discontinued . We are returning to port . Out . What do we do now ? We can 't touch him as long as he stays underwater . I wanted to get him while he was still recuperating . We 'll just have to wait . I know . Until he 's regenerated completely this time . Until he picks the spot to fight us again . Hello ? Yes . Yes . At once . What is it ? It 's your father . They 've got him at the hospital . - Is he- - - He had a heart attack . Karen is with him . Come on , Lisa . I 'll take you to him . No . Connie . You go with her . I 've got work to do . I can 't leave . Mark , don 't you think it 's about time you called it a day ? It 's after 10 : 00 . Just finished . It 's nearly two weeks straight you haven 't budged from this place . You and him . Let him sleep . He 's been knocking himself out . Still nothing new ? But now we 've got a ring of observation posts all around the Baltic Sea . Reptilicus can 't get out of this area without us knowing it . The professor said he could appear any day now . I know . How is the professor ? - Getting along fine . - Good . - Mark , he has attacked . - Where ? The skipper of a Swedish trawler reported him here . He capsized a freighter . Reptilicus was on the rampage . We never saw him , but we saw the trail of death and destruction he left behind . There . Right there , he ducked into the sea again . That 's only a few miles from the aquarium . Your father was right . The creature does seem to return to that spot . It would have to be right in our own backyard . Any further damage reports ? Another fishing village here , destroyed , two Swedish harbors , several freighters in the Baltic Sea . What is it ? Harbors ... freighters ... what next ? I had the blood of Reptilicus on my hands . Sometimes I- - sometimes I feel that perhaps also the blood of all those people- - - No , Svend . - If I 'd only left well enough alone . - Oh , you don 't mean that . - Still I found the thing ! Yes , and father brought it here . Any man would have done what you did . 83 , 19-8 . A sector , 17-4 . B sector , 14-6 . C sector , 27-3 . A sector . Attention , attention , this is an important announcement to everyone in Copenhagen . Do not panic . I repeat , do not panic . Chief of police Hassel together with military headquarters asks the cooperation of all citizens in maintaining a complete blackout . Again , I repeat- - stay off the streets and maintain a complete blackout . There is no reason to be afraid . The military has everything in hand . 9 , D sector ... 22-12 . F sector . Reptilicus last observed , coordinates 33-19 . Present position unknown . Repeat- - unknown . Out . Condition red . Ready for action , Sergeant ? Cover that sector . Drive on , soldier . - There he is , over there ! Reptilicus approaching the city ! Repeat- - Reptilicus approaching the city . This is Grayson . All units ... all units fire at will ! He 's already reached the outskirts of the city . The armament we can bring into action against him is now limited . No bombs . No heavy artillery . Field commanders , use flamethrowers ! Use flamethrowers ! Flamethrowers negative . Flamethrowers negative . They report they can 't use the flamethrowers . They can 't get close because of the acid slime . All right , we 'll take other measures . Where is he now ? Halfway across Amager Island headed for the canal . Langebro Bridge ! Let 's go ! Look ! Svend , Tell Brandt to go to the troops down there and take command himself . You and I will return to headquarters . We must set up emergency wards . Most of them are victims of that burning acid slime . We only have one chance . We know from experience that we can 't lick Reptilicus with our small arms and field pieces . We 'll have to drive him out from the densely populated area into open country , and then we clobber him with our heavy stuff . He 's ... here now . The stock exchange . Brandt will have to deploy his firepower so we can force the creature onto one definite route out of the city . The destruction will be terrible . We have no choice . Get me Captain Brandt . Brandt here . Bring your AKAK guns into action . - Yes , Mark . - We 've got to try some heavier stuff . AKAK fire on the double ! To the right ! To the right ! He 's coming this way ! Fire ! Fire ! He 's still coming ! Stop it ! Stop ! We 've done it ! It works ! He 's turning ! He 's turning ! He 's leaving the city ! He 's going back ! Get Captain Brandt . - Tell him to report here . - Yes , sir . That 's the line . Brandt , I want a concentration of real firepower all along here . You 'll get it . Reptilicus is headed for the suburbs . We must keep him from returning to the heart of the city . Brandt , this is important . No one on the line- - I repeat- - no one must open fire unless the creature turns back and then only on direct orders . Right . I think we can turn him . But only if everyone opens fire at the same time . Yes . There it is ! Captain Brandt ! Yeah ? Hold that fire ! That 's an order ! Cease firing ! He 's broken through the line , headed back into the city ! But how ? How could he do it ? Someone opened fire against my orders . The creature went for them and penetrated the line before Brandt could bring any concentrated firepower to bear . - Hassing , are you evacuating ? - It 's impossible . We 're getting as many people out of his way as we can , but he is unpredictable . How are the streets ? Impassible , many of them . Panic , fires . We 've got to stop him . What if I use my heavy weapons ? A bomb . But you 'd be killing thousands . You can 't do that . You cannot use a bomb . In the city or anywhere . General Grayson , you will have to understand . Reptilicus must not be blown to bits . Then suppose you tell me how I can destroy him . Not with explosives . I am a soldier , Professor Martens , not a scientist . That 's the way I know how to kill . Then learn another . All right , you tell me how . It 's not important how . It is important that he be destroyed without scattering him to the four corners of the earth . I don 't know how . Then we 'll do it my way . You want to blow him into 1,000 pieces ? We 'll pick up the pieces , destroy them . How are you going to find them all ? It 's better to have many small pieces than one giant animal . And how about many giant reptiles ? Are you so sure ... you 'll get all those small pieces ? How long do you expect me to continue this hell ? He 's getting more difficult to control ! He seems to know we can 't hurt him . But we 'll keep trying . Out . Take over . All right , Sergeant , get going . How is he ? The doctor gave him a hypo . He 's unconscious , resting . Karen is with him . What about Reptilicus ? Too bad we can 't give him a hypo . Knock him out . Drug him ? Just wishful thinking , Mark . No , wait a minute . You just hit on something . Is there a drug powerful enough to knock out a reptile big as he is ? Yes , there is . But you 'd need at least a gallon of it . And you 'd have to inject it into his bloodstream . How could you possibly do that ? Never mind that now . Can we lay our hands on enough of the stuff or make it up ? - I 'm sure we could . - Where ? They 'd have everything at the laboratories at the University . If we can knock the creature out , immobilize him , Professor Martens can destroy him , right ? - Yes . - Mark , a gallon of it ? How are you going to administer it ? It 's impossible . I have an idea . You 'll have to help me . Yes , of course , what is it ? I 'll tell you on the way to the University . Right now , get hold of someone who knows about those drugs . Have them meet us there at once . - Captain . - Yes , sir . - Get to ordnance . - Yes , sir . Lisa knows the university labs in and out . - We 're going with you . - Yes , Svend . - Here 's what I want you to pick up . - Yes , sir . And bring it to the University lab on the double ! Have you made contact with Captain Brandt ? No , sir . As soon as you reach him , tell him I 'm at the University . - Yes , sir . - Okay . - We got it ! - Bring it here . What 's the story ? Were going to take a crack at Reptilicus . What do you mean ? That bazooka rocket , Svend has removed most of the explosives . It 's got a drug in the warhead , almost a gallon . A drug ? It 'll knock the creature out cold if we can get it into his blood . But you can 't . You can 't get through his armor scales . Mark , we have tried . There 's one place I think we can penetrate . Where ? The soft skin inside his mouth . You 'll have to fire point-blank ... at very close range . I know . He 's just coming to the town hall square . If we can intercept him there , we can get close enough for a shot . And we 'd better not miss . We 've only got one rocket . There he is . Get the shell ! Go back , Brandt . I may be needed . Go back ! This is an order ! If we fail here , you 'll be needed . It 'll be your show . He 's turning away . That damned ambulance distracted him . Now we 'll have to outflank him ! Yes , before he gets of the open square . No , Brandt ! No ! He 's coming back . He 's in position . Load . It 's a good thing ... that there 's no more like him .

 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth found by a Kansas family , and raised as Clark Kent he learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ music continues ] I guess I 've .. ... always felt the need to dominate people . To , um .. .. control them .. ... to prove my superiority . ( female # 1 ) Why do you think that is ? Why ? ( female # 1 ) That 's what we 're here for , Lex . To find answers . Answers , hmm . Okay . How 's this ? I need to prove my superiority because , one , I am superior and two , the idiots I 'm forced to deal with present company included , are usually too stupid to realize it . Hence , the necessity for proof . How 's that answer ? ( female # 1 ) Very good . Very good . Excellent ! I 'm pleased . You 're letting your anger out . For a change . No , no . I 'm serious , Lex . We are making real progress . Ha ha , yeah right . Pretty soon I 'll be sane enough for execution . That is the law in this state . " A prisoner must be sane , at the time of his execution . " Ha , how hu-humane . Ha . And utterly futile . You don 't really think I 'll be here long enough for them to execute me , huh ? [ chuckling ] You 'll escape , alright . I don 't have any doubt about that . But you 'll be caught again . And then , I 'll escape again . Ad nauseam . Unless you change the pattern . I 'm trying , doctor . Please , I 'm really trying . By killing Superboy ? We all have our crosses to bear . You 'll never be able to do it . Unless you change . You think , humanity is nothing more than .. ... a swarm of insects crawling around your feet . Scum . Vermin . Head lice , actually . No , toe jam . But you need them , Lex . At least , some of them . Why ? So you can do what you want to do . What I want to do .. Kill Superboy ? Now , why , pray tell , would you encourage me on that endeavor ? I have my reasons . [ Lex laughing ] Oh , my , my , my ! This is positively byzantine . What sort of a doctor are you anyway ? Just a humble civil servant .. ... who thinks you 'll be well on your way to sanity .. ... if you just learned to cooperate with your fellow man . Bring in the other patient , please . [ door opening ] A little cooperation , can get you anything you want . [ intense music ] I 'd advise you to take this a little more seriously , Lex . [ laughing ] Seriously ? You tell me , the answer to my problems is to cooperate with my fellow man and then you roll in this Neanderthal hunk of junk . On his best day , he was no more than a cheap thug . Now , what could he possibly do for me ? Hey , Metallo don 't work for nobody . Admittedly , this is going to take some adjustment . But you are both here because of one person . Oh , please ! I 'll take care of Superboy in my own time , in my own way . And I 'm certainly not about to share the glory with this armor-plated cheesehead . Better get in line , chrome dome . I think my hour is up . Lex ! Goodbye , doctor ! I may be insane , but I 'm not crazy . [ dramatic music ] An alien that wanted to marry Superboy , and kill me a demon that tried to take our souls a gang that almost took over the city a werewolf , a gollum a couple of Satanists .. ... and a partridge in a pear tree . Well , it 's a living . Ever wonder what it 'd be like to have a normal life ? Lana , you had a normal life in Smallville , and you hated it . You were bored out of your skull . That 's why you came here . So maybe I was wrong . ( male voice over P.A. ) All inmates return . Return to your cells , or measures will be taken . [ alarm blaring ] Argh . [ alarm continues ] What 's that ? Oh . Oh , who cares . Let me have it . Oh , yeah . Come to papa . Yeah . Whoa ! This is better than I remember . [ alarm continues ] [ clanging ] [ alarm continues ] Hmm . Eh . [ glass shattering ] Psst , hey . Chrome dome , come here . You want out , huh ? - Ow ! - Armor-plated cheesehead , huh ? Not the better cheap thug ? Well , what 's that big fat brain of yours gonna do for you now ? I was kidding . Come on . Open up . We don 't have much time . No , no , no , that 's not good enough . - What do you want ? - What do you think ? I want you to suffer . Metallo ! No wait , come back ! Metallo ! [ door creaks ] Metallo ? [ dramatic music ] Unh . I miss the stars . Huh ? You can 't see the stars here . There 's too much light and pollution . Remember how many you could see in Smallville ? I remember it . Wanna give me a hand ? Do you remember the time we took my father 's telescope across the county line in the middle of the night ? And we saw Venus , Mercury , the rings around Saturn . - Jupiter 's moons ? - You got poison ivy . Clark , come on . Don 't you miss home even a little ? Of course I miss it . But there 's a time when you have to leave . ( Matt ) Clark ! Lana ! There 's a riot at State Prison . Luthor and Metallo got out . Looks like Superboy 's gonna be busy for a while . - I hope not . - What do you mean ? He 's fought them before and they 've almost killed him . Yeah , but he beat them . Never both at the same time . [ dramatic music ] [ theme music ] Good morning . Did it have a nice nap ? [ laughing ] Hiya , pal . Ey , easy , easy . She went through a lot of trouble to set this up . She ? ( Lex ) Well , well , well . The amazing doctor Vexman . Tell me , is this your idea of play therapy ? This is no game , Lex . And I was serious when we talked about cooperation . Mm-hmm , So was I. Better hear the lady out . I did . What 's in this for you ? [ chuckles ] Oh . I hope you have medical insurance . What could possibly be worth ... that ? Superboy . Ah . How did I know that ? And what do you have against Superboy ? A long time ago- - A long time ago , what ? A long time ago I knew him . That 's all . Now , what 's it going to be , Lex ? ( Vexman ) He 'll be flying . All I have to do , is honk the horn , or flash the lights . He 'll catch you , too . ( Vexman ) If I can 't kill him . I don 't care what happens to me . So ... what about it ? My way ... or the highway ? Kinda like the magnificent seven , huh ? Ha , ha . More like , Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein . [ dramatic music ] Did Luthor 's cell look like this ? Nope . Someone used a key on his . Someone ? Gotta figure , it was an inside job . May I see your personnel files , please ? Ah , we 've already been through ' em . Thought you might be interested in this one . Doctor Vexman . Prison psychologist . She was counseling both , Luthor and Metallo and .. ... she didn 't show up for work today . Dr. Vexman . Odessa Vexman . ( warden ) You know her ? I know her . [ crackling ] What 's taking you so long ? If I explained it to you , you still couldn 't understand . What 's that supposed to mean , huh ? [ chuckling ] My point exactly . You know , genius , nobody 's ever quite as smart as they think they are . My mother told me that . - Oh , really ? - Uh-huh . Was that before .. ... or after she won the Nobel Prize ? That 's it . I don 't have to take this kinda treatment .. Ah . You want to kill each other ? Go ahead . Do it . This wouldn 't be reverse psychology , would it ? Oh . Ah ah ah . Ain 't smart to hit a lady . Uh , hey . Go ahead . Be my guest . All the trouble I went to , it 's just wasted on you two . Well , what 're you waiting for ? Do it ! [ sobbing ] Oh , please ! Cut me some slack ! You really expect us to fall for these crocodile tears ? Hmph ! Dames . Lana , where are you going ? Oh , I just took a leave of absence . - What ? - It 's okay . It 's only for a week or two . Are you alright ? Yeah . I 'm fine . I just need to get away for a while . To Smallville . Uh , yeah . Pretty obvious , huh ? - You wanna come with me ? - I-I can 't . They let me go . I don 't understand why they won 't let you . They would , but I wanted to wait and see what happens with Luthor and Metallo . It 's over . They got away . Now , it 's up to the police . - Well , Superboy should- - - No , he shouldn 't ! It 's-it 's out of his hands now , Clark . I 'll-I 'll see you later . If-if you change your mind , you 'll know where I 'll be . Odessa Vexman . The police think she may be involved in getting Luthor and Metallo out of prison . I know . I heard it on the news . Hell hath no fury . What does that mean ? " Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned . " Well , it means- - I know . I was wondering what it has to do with this . Remember how Odessa was working for the guy who was gonna let that virus loose a few years back ? Yeah , Superboy stopped him . But he wouldn 't be able to if Odessa hadn 't switched sides to help him . I know . She was acquitted of all charges . Always wondered , why she did that . [ chuckling ] Clark , you are Matt ... you don 't think that .. Superboy didn 't lead her on . He didn 't want her to think- - That doesn 't matter . It 's how she felt about him that 's the problem . But how could that be his fault ? That doesn 't make any sense . That sort of thing seldom does . [ pleasant music ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ music continues ] Hello ! - Jim ? - Lana ! What 're you doing here ? I-I just took a few weeks off . It 's great to see ya again . I figured , hell would freeze over before you 'd come back . Well , you never know . Um , can I ask you something ? Is that what I think it is ? Yeah , it 's a poker parlor . Isn 't that illegal ? Well , you know how bad the economy 's been around here . Lot of farms were failing ' . Well , this developer just came into town . A Mr. Trenton . Said if we legalize gamblin' it 'd help build the town up . He just opened this place and he 's got a couple of others on the edge of town . He 's really turning ' the place around . He 's turning it into a sewer . Ha , you sound like some of the old people . Lana , this is what the town wants now . [ explosion ] [ dramatic music ] [ lady screaming ] [ explosion ] - Odessa ! - Superboy , my old friend . You and I were never friends . Except when you needed something from me . You helped me because it was the right thing to do . I helped you because- - Because you wanted something from me . Maybe . But now , there 's only one thing I want . Hiya , pal ! You and me got some history , too . [ laughing ] [ groans ] [ continues laughing ] [ groaning ] [ whooshing ] Metallo , over here . Metallo ! Come on , Metallo . You want me ? I 'm right here . Whoa ! [ high pitched tone ] [ groaning ] Kinda feels like an ice pick in the ear drum , doesn 't it ? But then , I guess you wouldn 't know what an ice pick in the ear drum feels like , would you ? It kinda feels like this . [ laughing ] Ah . You know , I asked myself " how the devil does he turn off his super hearing ? " Then I thought , " Hey , maybe he can 't . " So I whipped up this ultra high frequency tone generator and you know the beauty of it is , us mere mortals can 't even hear it . Just you and the dogs . [ laughing ] That was some trip . Phew ! I bet the balance center in your inner ear is going south , right about now . [ high pitched tone ] [ no audio ]

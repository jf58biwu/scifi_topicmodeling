 [ announcer ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed a strength of steel , the speed of light , and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . You 're risking everything . We 're in a new country now . Things will not be handed to us like they were in Saint Ephrem . [ blowing ] I checked it . I x-rayed it . There wasn 't anyone in that car . I 'm lookin ' out my window , and that black guy , he must 've been scared because he jumped in the car ... And the next thing , Superboy blows that truck right on top of him and the whole thing goes up in flames . I thought for sure you were gonna save him . We will take all the Capitol City halls and mar . I came here to say goodbye . You can 't leave , we need you . I killed a man . Yeah , we know , son . We heard about it on the news . I didn 't ask to be like this . And I can 't help everybody . That 's why I had to turn off the news . No one expects you to do it all . Don 't they ? What if Superboy found out what really happened that night ? It would probably be better if Superboy didn 't find out . [ rooster crowing ] Well when do you think he 'll be back ? Uh-huh ... OK , I 'll try back later . Thanks , Mrs. Kent . Jackson 's gonna kill you when he sees the long distance bill . Look at what I got . I 've been checking that witness ' mail . The one who says he saw Superboy kill that guy . After the accident , the guy 's bought a car , a Rolex , an apartment at Holbert Towers . So ? Someone 's living his dream life and paying cash . The guy makes 18,000 a year . There 's something wrong . All right , it 's a little suspicious . Tell the cops . Not until I get some more answers . I 'd forgotten how good country air smells . [ chuckles ] You got that right , son . Sit down , have yourself a good country breakfast because you 're gonna need it . We 're gonna get to sinking that new well . Great . You got the drill bit fixed ? No , it 's still broken . What do I need a drill bit for when I got you ? Well , like I said before , Pa . I don 't mind helpin ' , but it 's just plain old Clark . OK , OK . If it 's just gonna be plain old Clark , that 's all right with me . And that 's the way it should be . If you did your Pa 's work for him , he 'd just be mopin' around the house telling me what to do , getting in my way . - [ groans ] There she goes again . - Hm . By the way , Lana called . She wants to talk to you . Oh , I 'll call her later . [ machine gun firing ] [ men laugh ] Playing with toys ... as usual . Yes , but my toys are getting bigger . How are you doing , my friend ? I was saddened ... but not surprised to hear of Winston 's death . It 's a tragedy . What do you have Llewellyn ? And it better be worth 4,000 miles . What I have is a plan . We 've dug in here , taken root and grown . But now I want to expand and break into the world market . Is that why you called me ? To offer me a supply of M76s I can get anywhere ? What about the white ice shells ? Binary chemical weapons ... Fresh out of eastern Europe and in transit now to a disposal site in the South Pacific . Interesting . And I suppose they 're lying around in America everywhere these days . No . But they are arriving tonight at local military repository . Repositories have guards . I have an army . They also have big doors with their respective big locks . I have a key . [ Jonathan chuckles ] Oh , thanks , Ma . Forgot what it was like having him around . He 's turned into quite a man . Yes , he has . But he doesn 't belong here , Jonathan . What do you mean ? Can 't you feel it ? The part that 's been missing is back . I haven 't been this happy in ages . But is he ? Takes a lot longer this way . Nothing wrong with a little honest work . [ chuckles ] Nothing wrong with using your God given gifts either . Except when someone dies because of them . Son , I don 't mean to push , but sometimes it 's not black and white . I remember the first time I saw you as Superboy . I wanted to feel proud , but all I felt was cold , numb . It reminded me of the time that Jonathan went off to the war . I didn 't want him to go . Mostly because I knew that he could be killed or hurt , but also because he might hurt or kill other people . I didn 't know I could love a man who had done such things . It took time . But then I saw that sometimes you don 't have a choice . Sometimes , we don 't . I have a choice . Yes , I know . And I 'll be proud of you no matter what choice you make . Oh ! Oh damn it ! [ shouts ] Clark ! Pa ! [ shouting ] - Pa ! - Clark ! Help ! Clark ! Clark ! [ grunts ] - Are you OK ? - [ sighs ] Oh , that was too close for comfort , I 'll tell you . Thank goodness you were here . [ Jonathan ] Thanks , son . It 's all right , it 's all right . [ reporter ] Analysts say that today 's fall in the stock market index is indicative of the overall state of the economy . And in other news , there 's still no suspects in the Capitol City car bombing that took the lives of three alleged gang members . Police say gang warfare 's been on the rise in that city since the disappearance of Superboy . Coming up on WKPX , more of your country favorites , and Bolt Pickens with the weather . I 'm going back . We were just getting used to having you here . And I was getting used to being back . But for the wrong reasons . I 'm still not sure how I fit in , but ... I think this afternoon proved that no matter where I go , I can 't hide from who I am . Sounds to me like you 've been doing some thinkin ' . I guess I have the two of you to blame for that . We just told you how we felt . You did your own thinking . Whoever sent me here sure knew what they were doing . Can I give you a lift to the bus station ? Not this time . I 'll get my things . Have the battalionaires report directly to me . We go tonight at eight o 'clock . Llewellyn , he insisted on seeing you , man . It doesn 't surprise me . When you 're not used to it , money goes very quickly , doesn 't it ? Exactly . I knew you 'd understand . I hate to seem greedy , but ... But you are . I understand perfectly . Look , all I want is a few thousand more . I mean , that 's not much for guys like you . Don 't worry . You 'll get your due tonight . Desmond will deliver it himself . Remember , anything happens ... my lawyer 's got everything on how I framed Superboy for you . All of it . Find his home ... And when you do ? Kill him . Then join us at the site ... - What about ... - ... then kill his lawyer . Hey , you 're back . Never thought I 'd miss this place . Yeah , it grows on you . Lana leave for the day ? No , she 's upstairs . Lana ? Look who 's here . - Is your dad better ? - Huh ? His back ? Why you went home ? Oh , it cleared right up . Lana ! I thought she said she was gonna work late tonight . - Oh no ... - What 's wrong ? She dug up some information on the witness who saw Superboy kill that guy . - What was it ? - Financial stuff . Looked like it might 've been a pay off . She 's been talking about confronting him , but I told her ... - Where does he live ? - Holbert Towers , I think she said . You 'd better call the police . Right , right . The police . - [ dialing ] - [ operator ] You have reached 911 emergency service line . All lines are busy . Please do not hang up and your call will be answered in the order received ... - It 's busy ! - Look , I 'm gonna head over there . - No , wait ! - Don 't hang up until you 've gotten help . Look , we 'll make a deal . I 'll give you half of everything I get from Llewellyn . OK , make it three quarters . Hell , I 'll give it all to you . Listen , I was wrong . Greedy . Look , tell Llewellyn I don 't need any more money . I 'll keep quiet . Boy , you 'll keep quiet , all right . What 's that ? Is that a bomb ? ! Think of it as a way to unburden your soul . [ clatters ] - Hi ! - Who are you ? I ... I 'm the decorator . Mr. Mayall asked me to come in and take a look at his closets . Um , see , people usually neglect their closets ... Again , did Superboy kill Winston ? - The bomb first . - No , man . Truth first , then perhaps the bomb . How did Winston die ? OK ... OK ! When everything started coming down that night ... the older guy , Winston , he tried to get away . Llewellyn was waitin ' for him . The truck had already crashed and was burnin ' . Llewellyn hit Winston with a brick or somethin ' , chucked him into the car and let him fry . Superboy didn 't know squat what was happening . [ beeping ] Look , I told you it was your boss ... Hey ... where are you going ? I 'm leaving , of course . What about the bomb ? Oh ... you can keep it . [ whimpers ] Am I glad to see you ! Did you hear any of that , Superboy ? You didn 't kill anyone . Hurry , wait out there . It 's a bomb . Looks that way . Aren 't you gonna take it ? Did Llewellyn really kill Winston ? Yes ! [ coughs ] That scum Llewellyn was double crossing me . But I got a little info that just might even the score . - What is it ? - Tonight , eight o 'clock . They 're hittin ' the weapons depository in Bay Hill . Keep an eye on him . I 'll send for the police . Hey , aren 't you gonna untie me ? Well , I guess it 's just you and me now , huh ? All this happened because of you . That 's true . And if you untie me , I 'll make a couple of things happen between you and me , too . OK , let 's go . Move . Fire ! Ah , Superboy . Well done . How many of my men did you kill this time ? That won 't work anymore . But it still doesn 't change the weakness you showed me . Because you are weak . Your justice is weak . When I get out , and I will get out , I 'll take advantage of your humanity . Llewellyn . For Winston . [ gun shot ] Apparently , they were from Saint Ephrem and they were running arms . I 'm back . And I 'm going to stay .

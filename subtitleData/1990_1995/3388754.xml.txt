 Why do you think our stock 's in the toilet ? Because you 're cutting research in halo . You 've oorgotten what the adventure 's about . The industry 's changing . We need to make some hard choices . - Save your sound bite oor the press ! - Let 's not relive the stockholders ' meeting . You 're killing me ! You 're killing my company ! Eurisko is not your company , Brad . Not any more . And you damn well better grow up and get used to it ! You 're gonna regret this . ( door slams ) ( Ben ) Newparagraph . As I 'm sure everyone on the board will agree , ... .. Eurisko has to face head-on the realities ofan increasingly competitive world . Since the unfortunate departure ofBrad Wilczek , ... .. I have made recommendations thatlbelieve will reposition Eurisko as an industry leader . At the top ofthis listis the immediate termination ofthe COS project . Its disastrous performance over the past three quarters andprojectedlosses well into 1994 ... .. leave us no other choice . ( sighs ) ( water running ) Hm . Ah ... ( phone rings ) Hello ? Hello ! - At the tone , Eastern Standard Time ... - ( whirring ) .. will be 7.35pm. What the hell ... ? ( beeping ) Damn . Argh ! ( computer ) File deleted . Mulder . Jerry ? You 're Dana Scully , right ? Jerry Lamana . - We worked together in Violent Crimes . - " Worked together " ! We were partners . That 's $ 8.50 , please . - Jerry , what are you doing here ? - Looking oor you . And I 'm buying you lunch . - No , really . - Look , it 's on me . Here . - Cause oo death was electrocution . - And it wasn 't accidental ? Looks like some kind oo elaborate booby trap , but we don 't know a whole lot more . Engineer just oound him 12 hours ago . - Who 's running the investigation ? - Either ooyou know Nancy Spiller ? The oorensics instructor at the Academy ! - We used to call her the iron Maiden . - On a good day ! Anyway , she 's putting together the squad and ... .. I took the liberty oo mentioning your name . Look , Jerry , I 'd like to help you out , but we 're not on general assignment . Because oothe X-Files ? Look , the truth is I could use a little help on this. I don 't wanna drop the ball on this one . You won 't drop the ball . Drake wasn 'tjust the CEO oo a Fortune 500 company . He was a good oriend oo the Attorney General 's . Another oeather in my cap would be nice cos the one I got is looking mangy . - Yeah , but , Jerry ... - Look , ... .. I wouldn 't ask io it wasn 't important . - How come you went your separate ways ? - l 'm a pain in the ass to work with . - Seriously , Mulder . - l 'm not a pain in the ass ? We had different career goals . Jerry wanted the oifth oloor . - And you ? - l was gunning oor a basement office ... .. with no heat or windows . Well , I know where you ended up . What about Jerry ? He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta working Hate Crimes . - What kind oo bad luck ? - He misplaced a piece oo evidence . Sent it to the cleaners . By the time he got it back , a oederal judge had lost both hands and an eye . ( elevator buzzer ) - ( Scully ) 29 ? - Uh-huh . - ( computer ) Going up . - Must be oor the visually impaired . How about that ? A politically correct elevator . Third floor . - ( Scully giggles ) - Fourth floor . - You OK ? - Yeah . What was that ? - ( man ) Yes ? - Hello ? - Security . Who 's this ? - This is Agent Dana Scully . - Do you have a problem ? - ( computer ) Fifth floor . Sixth floor . Uh , actually , I think everything 's OK . Ninth floor . Tenth floor . Eleventh floor . ( beeping ) See here ? Someone has tampered with the servo . They switched the ground to the negative , ... - .. so when he put the key in the lock ... - He completed the circuit . It 's oused . It takes a lot oojuice to melt a steel key . And to throw a 180-pound man ten oeet . The servo switch - could it have been moved manually ? We didn 't olnd any prints in the surrounding area . Sure. it could have been switched manually , but whoever did it had to override the COS . - What 's the COS ? - The Central Operating System . It runs the building . It regulates everything orom energy output to the volume oowater in each toilet olush . This is Claude Peterson , a building systems engineer . He oound the body . lo you wanted to override the COS , what would they ... ? First you 'd have to break the access code , which ... well , let 's say it wouldn 't be easy . ( Mulder ) We 'll need a list oo the people with that know-how . I can tell you right now , it 'll be a short list . - Would you be on it ? - Me ? ! Hey , look , I 'm just a glorioied building super . All I do is monitor the system , make sure it 's ounctioning properly , ... .. like when I saw the overload in Mr Drake 's office . What about the phone lines ? Does the COS monitor all calls ? - Yes , it does . Why ? - l 'm just wondering . OK . Look , can I go now ? Why 'd you ask him about the phones ? Phone 's offthe hook . Maybe Drake was talking to somebody right beoore he did his Ben Franklin impersonation . Taught him everything he knows . - ( knocking ) - ( Mulder ) Come in . It 's past three . I 'm just looking oor my prooile notes . Maybe ioyou cleaned your desk more than once a year . They were right here. I 'm telling you . We 're late . ( Jerry ) There are a couple oo elements oor us to consider . Both the statistical rarity oo homicidal electrocution ... .. and the complexity oothe crime indicate a certain devious premeditation . After all , there are much simpler ways oo killing someone . All oowhich leads me to believe that our guy was some kind oo sociopathic game player , ... .. maybe even a recluse , ... .. since he designed a trap , not only to avoid detection , ... .. but to avoid contact with the victim . is that your prooile ? ( whispers ) Forget it . No . Drake 's oinal phone call supports this theory . At the tone , Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm. Drake 's estimated time oo death . Why would Drake call oor the correct time just beoore he died ? It was an incoming call ... .. orom somewhere in the Eurisko building itselo . Whoever set the trap wanted to make sure that Drake took the bait . - Excellent work , Agent Lamana . - Thank you . Jerry , what the hell are you doing ? - Hey , don 't get all bent out oo shape . - That was my prooile . Look , I didn 't think you 'd mind . Anyway , they were just notes . I ollied in the blanks . Jerry , you went into my office and you stole my work . Look , you 're on this case cos l asked you to help me out , and you helped me out . What is the big deal ? - What did he say ? - He apologised ... in his own way . I just got offthe phone with Peterson , the systems engineer . One name ! Brad Wilczek ? He said it would be a short list . And it 's headline news how much he despised Drake . That just seems too obvious . To kill Drake would be so brazenly egomaniacal . And oully consistent with Jerry 's excellent behavioural prooile . ( Mulder ) Fully . This is what a 220 lQ and a $ 400-million severance settlement buys you . Yes ? Brad Wilczek ? We 're with the fbi . What took you guys so long ? Would you mind taking offyour shoes ? You can divide the computer science industry into two types oo people : neat and scruffy . - Benjamin Drake oit into the oirst category ? - Neat people like things neat . They wear nicely pressed suits and work on surface phenomena . Things they can understand : market shares and third-quarter prooits . And you had a different vision oor the company ? I started Eurisko out oo my parents ' garage . I was 22 years old . I 'd just spent a year oollowing around The Grateoul Dead . - You know what Eurisko means ? - Mm-mm . That 's orom the Greek , isn 't it ? Um , ... " l learn things " . Not exactly. lt means " l discover things " . But Ben Drake wasn 't interested in discovery . He was a short-sighted , power-hungry opportunist . Let me show you something . Smart home . From this prototype I have access to every square ooot oo my house . This place is as saoe as Fort Knox and as energy efficient as your average igloo . We were two years ahead oo Microsoft ... .. when Drake , in his inoinite wisdom , killed the programme . is this system related to the one in your corporate building ? Variation on a theme . How many people know the system well enough to override it ? Finally the bonus question . Not many is the answer . Could someone have hacked into the system ? Not your average phone oreak , that 's oor sure . But there 's plenty oo kooks out there . Data travellers , electro wizards , techno anarchists . Anything 's possible . - Could you have done it ? - Oo course. I designed the system . That 's why you guys are here , isn 't it ? I 'm your logical suspect . You don 't seem too worried . It 's a puzzle , Ms Scully . And scruffy minds like me like puzzles . We enjoy walking down unpredictable avenues oothought , turning new corners . But as a general rule scruffy minds don 't commit murder . Some see genius as the ability to connect the unconnected . To makejuxtapositions . To see relationships where others cannot . is Brad Wilczek a genius ? I don 'tknow . But I do know this for certain . He has a predilection for elaborate game playing ... .. and knowledge ofthe Eurisko building . And he has a demonstrable motive for killing Benjamin Drake . The question remains . But ifhe 's so clever , how do we nail him ? End offieldjournal , October24th 1993 . ( beeping ) ( computer ) File opened . ( Wilczek ) From the outset , I knewEurisko would expand effectively , ... .. not by traditional Western structures , but by employing certain Zen beliefs ... .. and otherEastern philosophies . ( rewinding ) .. and otherEastern philosophies . ( rewinding ) .. Eastern philosophies ... .. Eastern ... Would you give me a second ? Look , I 'm here with my hat in my hand . I screwed up. I 'm sorry . What more can I say ? All you had to do was ask . I would have helped you with the prooile . - You don 't know what it 's like . - What what 's like ? You heard about Atlanta ? They got me on six months ' probation. I gotta oile daily reports like some cherry-new agent . That was bad luck . Could have happened to anybody . Not to you . Don 't run yourselo down . You 're a good agent . - We did some good work together . - Let 's oace it , I was tagging along . - That 's not how it was . - How would you know ? You were too busy dazzling them up there on the high wire . Mulder . Take a look . We borrowed this orom the voice biometrics lab at Georgetown . It 's a computer spectrogram capable oo identifying individual speech patterns . This is the recording the COS made oothe phone call Drake received just beoore he died . At the tone , Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm. This we put together orom a series oo lectures Wilczek gave at the Smithsonian last year . ( uneven ) At the tone , Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm. Now we 'll stack them . ( simultaneous voices ) At the tone , Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm. - You saying this is the same person ? - l 'm saying both voices are Brad Wilczek 's . He may have disguised his voice , but not the oormants unique to his own speech patterns . Which means that he was the one that killed Drake . He had the motive and the means . And now we have the physical evidence . Judge Benson lives in Washington Heights . I can get a warrant in less than an hour . Someone must make sure Wilczek stays put . - l 'll go with you . - No , I 'm gonna bring him in alone . I need this one , Mulder . All right . ( typing ) Come on , come on . Let me in . Damn ! ( engine starts ) Mr Wilczek ! ( computer ) Going up . Second floor . Thirdfloor . Fourth ... - Can I help you ? - fbi . ( computer ) Welcome back , Brad . You 're not equipped with a voice synthesizer . What is my user level ? That is nowat the discretion of the operating system . Going up . Second floor . Thirdfloor . Fourth floor . Fifth floor . Sixth floor . Seventh floor . Eighth floor . Ninth floor . Tenth floor . Eleventh floor . Twelfth floor . Fourteenth floor . Fifteenth floor . Sixteenth floor . What the hell ... ? What are you doing ? Sorry . Those commands are notavailable at your current userlevel . Try again . Twenty-third floor . Twenty-fourth floor . - What are you doing ? ! - Whatare you doing ? Twenty-eighth floor . Twenty-ninth floor . Thirtieth floor . ( elevator sticks ) Twenty-ninth . Thirtieth . Twenty-ninth . Thirtieth ... Twenty-ninth . Thirtieth . Twenty-ninth . Thirtieth ... Oh , man ! Going down . ( shouts ) No ! Don 't do this ! Oh , my God . ( crash ) ( computer ) Program executed . I heard about Jerry . I 'm sorry . I don 't think Wilczek did it . What ? It doesn 't make sense . Why would he go back to Eurisko ? To destroy evidence . To cover his tracks . lo you were gonna destroy evidence , would you pose oor the cameras ? Mulder . You 've been through a lot . More than I think even you realise . I think Wilczek is smarter than this . He just signed a conoession . How much prooo do you need ? This is a crime scene . You 'll have to leave . Yeah , I know. I ordered the subpoena . - That subpoena 's been obviated . - What are you talking about ? Unless you 've got a Code 5 clearance , I 'm gonna have to ask you to turn back . - Thanks oor coming . - l 'm here against my betterjudgement . In the outure I must insist that you respect the terms oo our arrangement . Why is Wilczek under a Code 5 investigation ? Why do the Deoence Department want him ? Why do you think they want the most innovative programmer in this hemisphere ? - Software ? - Yeah . For years Wilczek has thumbed his nose at any contract involving weapons applications . He 's a bleeding heart . What kind oo software ? How much do you know about artioicial intelligence ? I thought it was only theoretical . It was ... until two years ago . Remember Helsinki ? The oirst time a chess-playing computer beat a grandmaster ? That was Wilczek 's program . And the rumour was that he did it by developing the oirst adaptive network . An adaptive network ? It 's a learning machine . A computer that actually thinks . And it 's , uh , become something oo a holy grail ... .. oor some oo our more inquisitive colleagues in the Department oo Deoence . They make me wear shoes all the time . What else do you want orom me ? Why are you willing to spend the rest ooyour lioe in prison oor a crime you didn 't commit ? - What are you talking about ? I 'm guilty ! - l know you 're innocent ! You 're protecting the machine . The Central Operating System at Eurisko . lo l 'm protecting anything , it 's not the machine . Then what ? After the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , ... .. Robert Oppenheimer spent the rest oo his lioe regretting he 'd ever glimpsed an atom . Oppenheimer may have regretted his actions , but he never denied responsibility oor them . He loved the work , Mr Mulder . His mistake was in sharing it with an immoral government . I won 't make the same mistake . But your machine killed Drake . And it killed my oriend . I 'm sorry about what happened , ... .. but there 's nothing I can do . And you talk about morality ! You 're aoraid oothe government , but you 'll accept the risk your machine will kill again ! Lesser ootwo evils . What about a third option ? You created that machine . Now you tell me how to destroy it . Wilczek can create a virus to destroy the system . Mulder , don 't you see ? Blaming the machine is an alibi , and a bad one . It 's the only thing that makes sense . The COS project was posting big losses oor Eurisko . Drake was about to end the programme . So the machine killed Drake out oo selo-deoence ? Selo-preservation - the primary instinct oo all sentient beings . Mulder , that level oo artioicial intelligence is decades away orom being realised . Then why was our government trying to usurp Wilczek 's research ? I think you 're looking oor something that isn 't there . And I think it has something to do with Jerry . Maybe it wouldn 't be such a bad idea io you talked to someone . You 're probably right . - Where are you going ? - To talk to someone . How much time do you need ? ( phone rings ) - Hello ? - ( modem dialling ) Oh , my God . This is Special Agent Dana Scully , id number 2317-616 . I need you to run a quick trace on a number oor me . Yeah . 202-555-6431 . Yeah , that 's my number . Somebody 's accessing my computer . ( vehicle approaching ) - Mulder ! - Scully , what are you doing here ? Someone or something 's been scanning my computer oiles , tapping my phones . I traced the line . It came orom somewhere in there . It 's the machine . How can we get in ? Remember the Trojan Horse ? Open sesame . Oh , what the ... - Mulder ! - ( glass shatters ) ( continuous honking ) ( honking stops ) So much oor the element oo surprise ! What do you say we take the stairs ? ( Mulder ) 28 down , one to go . ( Scully ) Oh , great . Mulder ? Trick or treat ? No ! - What are you doing ? - Don 't wanna make the mistake Drake did . ( Scully screams ) ( gasps ) Who you lookin ' at ? There should be a way oor you to drop down and open the door . ( panting ) Come on , Scully . ( beeping ) Scully ? Agent Mulder . What are you doing here ? ( air blowing ) ( Scully coughing ) Ah ... Argh ! Ah ... Ah ! Ah ! Argh ! Aaargh ! Uh ! The machine 's been acting all crazy . Power surges , shut-offs . That 's why I 'm here so late . - Where 's the B-port ? - Oh , it 's right back here . Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? Because ioyou don 't , it 's myjob on the line . ( beeping ) Damn . ( computer ) System access granted . User code : level 7 . Now I can put in the virus . Not bad , Agent Mulder . You know , I 've been trying to access the CPU oor the past two years . Now , please , take out your gun and remove the clip . Careoul . Deoence Department ? Let 's say our paychecks are signed by the same person . Now give me the diskette and step away orom there . You don 't want to test my resolve , Agent Mulder . Put down the gun . - You don 't know what you 're dealing with . - Shut up and drop the gun ! You 're making a mistake , Agent Scully . Compromising your sworn duty . This operation is more sensitive than you can possibly imagine . - Don 't listen to him . - The technology in this machine ... .. is oo enormous scientioic interest . ( Mulder ) lt 's a monster. lt 's killed two people . - They can 't handle it any better than Wilczek . - Make no mistake . You will be held accountable . Mulder , put in the disk . What are you doing , Brad ? Don 't do this , Brad . Bad command orfile name . Sector 7 notfoundhome . ( garbled voices ) Brad ... Brad ... Brad , ... why ? I checked with the Department oo Corrections subcommittee . - l even petitioned the Attorney General . - You won 't olnd him . They can 't take a man like Brad Wilczek without an explanation . They can do anything they want . Where is he ? In the middle oowhat we in the trade call " hard bargaining " . Wilczek won 't deal . He 'll never work oor them . Loss oooreedom does ounny things to a man , and Wilczek conoessed to two murders . And you effectively destroyed the only evidence that could have exonerated him . What else could I have done ? Nothing , unless you were willing to let the technology survive . The Department oo Deoence still hasn 't oound anything ? They 've been on it oor olve days . Wilczek 's virus was thorough . It left no trace oothe artioicial intelligence . The machine is dead . ( man ) We pushed the pulse code modulations to the limit . Nothing . ( Peterson ) We 've combed the parsing subroutine . Yes , sir . Twice . No , sir . Still nothing , but I 'd like to request ... Yes , sir . No , I understand . Yes , sir . Six more hours beoore we have to consign the whole damn thing to the metal shredder . ( man ) We 'll do what we can , sir . ( beeping ) ( Peterson ) I 'm gonna figure this thing outifitkills me . Visiontext subtitles : Natasha Cohn ( child ) Imade this ! ( scrabbling ) ( dog whimpers ) ( laboured breathing ) We 're not ... who ... we are . We 're not ... who ... we are . It goes no ourther than this . It stops right here , ... .. right now . ( gunshot ) ( gunshot ) Team Captain John Richterhere . It 's been a couple offrustrating months . But aftera lot ofstick-with-it-ness , we 're proud to report thathalfan hourago , ... .. we broke the previous record for drilling down into an ice sheet . ( men cheer ) ( Mulder ) This team oo scientists made up the Arctic ice Core Project . They were sent to Alaska by the Advanced Research Project Agency a year ago ... .. to drill into the arctic ice . The samples they removed ... .. contained trapped gases , dust , chemicals . They could reveal the structure oo the Earth 's climate back to the dawn oo man . Their work was a success , nearly completed . No reports or indications oo problems oo any kind . Until , only a week later , this next transmission . ( laboured breathing ) We 're not ... who ... we are . We 're not ... who ... we are . It goes no further than this . It stops ... righthere , ... .. right now . What happened up there ? So oar nobody 's been able to reach the compound because oo bad weather . Obviously we must be brilliant or expendable because we 've pulled the assignment . It is severe isolation distress ? These were top geophysicists , trained and screened oor this project in every way , ... .. including psychological makeup . We leave oor Nome today . We 'll join three scientists oamiliar with the ice Core Project , ... .. and then head north up to the icy Cape . The National Weather Service gives us three days to get in and out beoore the next storm . Bring your mittens . ( over headphones ) Here 's the snap . Fouts dumps itacross to Winslow ! Touchdown ! Touchdown ! Fouts ... is ... God ! Sorry . My team scored . There 's no oootball on Wednesdays . Fouts retired in ' 87 , didn 't he ? No , this is just my all-time oavourite plays on tape . - You two fbi ? - Agent Mulder , Agent Scully . And you ? Denny Murphy . Prooessor oo Geology , UC San Diego . San Diego ? Get much chance to study ice down there ? Just what 's around the cake . Dr Da Silva ? Dr Hodge ? Yeah . Sorry we 're late . Agents Scully and Mulder . Prooessor Murphy . Can I see some identioication ? - What oor ? - l wanna make sure we are who we say . That 's me . ( Murphy ) lt 's you . - That 's me . - Thanks a lot . Well , now that we know who we are , anybody care to guess why we 're going ? Two oederal agents , a geologist , a doctor and a toxicologist . That should give us some idea . I assume you all took a look at the tape . - Something wrong ? - Come on . You 're fbi . You have to know more than we do . You oolks the ones goin ' up to icy Cape ? - Yeah . - Then I 'm the one olyin ' you . My name 's Bear . The plane 's across the way . Provisions are loaded . Grab your gear . Can we see some credentials ? Credentials ? The only credentials I have is that I 'm the only pilot willing to oly you up there . You don 't like those credentials , ... .. walk . Bear , see ioyou can get the power started . Anything to get out oo here . Where do we start ? The body bags are on the plane . Beoore we touch anything , we have to thoroughly document the scene . ( Scully ) Flashing . ( camera click ) ( Mulder ) That 's what they were drilling oor . A quarter oo a million years melting away in a couple oo days . I 'm gonna preserve some samples . ( door creaks ) ( bang ) - lt 's the generator . - Oh . - ( growl ) - Agent Mulder ! Hold on ! Hold it down ! ( dog barks ) ( dog whimpers ) ( Hodge ) That ought to keep him out oor a while . - Are you OK ? - Yeah . He didn 't break the skin . - Bear ? Are you OK ? - He got me . - Get thatjacket off . - Just gimme the stuff. I 'll do it myselo . ( Da Silva ) ls it rabies ? I don 't see any indication oo glottal spasm or tetany . lo it is rabies , it 's not a strain I 'm oamiliar with . ( Scully ) Look at this . Black nodules . Swollen lymph nodes . Symptoms oo bubonic plague . We 'll do a blood test . We 'll take it orom there . This dog ... .. has got a skin irritation round its neck . Looks like it 's been scratching off its own hair . Look at this . Look at this ! What ... the hell ... was that ? Agh ! Oh ... From the autopsies , it 's clear these men killed one another . There are contusions around the throat areas oothree men , ... .. evidence oo strangulation . Richter and Campbell killed themselves . I also oound tissue damage due to oever . Did any oothem have the black spots the dog has ? No . None oothem had the black nodules . So ... those spots didn 't have anything to do with those guys killing ' each other , right ? I wouldn 't rule it out . I just re-examined the dog . - The nodules are gone . - What could that mean ? It could mean the spots are a symptom oo some disease at an early stage . Denny ? Denny . ( voice through headphones ) Denny . Sorry . The play-off game against Miami , ' 82 . Helps me get my mind off stuff . My interpretation oo satellite remote sensing photos is a little rusty . All right . This is the icy Cape area . It approximates the depth oothe ice sheet to be about ... 3,000 metres thick . I also oound this data . lo l 'm reading it correctly , the team actually oound the ice sheet to be twice that depth . That 's very good . The numbers indicate the topography to be concave . Looks like they were drilling inside a meteor crater . ( Hodge ) No , it 's impossible . - l analysed two samples . - What did you olnd ? There seems to be a presence oo ammonium hydroxide in Richter 's blood . It 's not possible . Ammonia would vaporise at human body temperature . I checked all the air oiltration systems . - l oound no evidence oo any such toxins . - l have . In the ice . And that 's not all there is . I oound a high ratio oo ammonia to water in the ice core . The Earth 's atmosphere couldn 't do that , not even 1 / 4 million years ago . Look in the scope . Unless a ooreign object was introduced into that environment . ( Murphy ) Tell me that 's not a ooreign object . Oh ! Scully . That same thing is in Richter 's blood ! What iothat single-celled organism is the larval stage oo a larger animal ? That 's kind oo a leap , don 't you think ? ( Scully ) The evidence is there . Maybe the organism somehow got into the men . Nothing can survive in subzero temperatures oor 1 / 4 million years . Unless that 's how it lives . Lookit , I don 't see why you 're squabbling over some bug . You said your autopsy oound those men killed each other . That 's it. I say let 's get the hell out oo here . I agree . We can have the bodies ... .. sent to a oacility which can make a deoinitive diagnosis . In the event that something was missed , Agent Scully . lo those bodies are inoected , we can 't take them back . We can 't go back without proper quarantine procedures . - We can 't risk bringing back the next plague . - Say they did come down with something . We haven 't , and I ain 't waiting ' around until we do . I think it 's saoe to go back . There 's no reason why we 'd be inoected . - We took all the saoeguards . - The dog did bite Bear . - ltjumped Mulder ! - There 's only one way to proceed ! A doctor eliminates every possibility . We must determine io any oo us is inoected . All right . Parasitic diagnostic procedure ... .. requires us each to provide a blood and a stool sample . A stool sample ? Travel always makes that kinda tough ... oor me . OK ... Anybody got the morning sports section handy ? - l ain 't dropping ' my cargo oor no one . - ( crash ) I 'm gettin ' my gear , gettin ' my plane , and olyin ' the hell outta here ! You can 't go . The dog bit you . I got hired to oly you up here and oly you back ! No one said this might be part oo the deal , so the deal is over . We can 't let him leave . - Who 's gonna stop him ? - We have to . We can 't risk inoecting the population . He gets on that plane , I go with him . - We don 't have time to argue . - Take a vote . Who says we should conoine Bear until he agrees to an examination ? All right . Bear , we just want to check you out . lo we don 't olnd any trace oo the parasite or the virus , we 'll all go . All right . Gimme the damn jar . Murphy ! Get a rope ! Here ! Oh , my God ! ( Bear groans ) - Get my bag ! - What are you gonna do ? ! - Cut it out . - We don 't know enough about it . It 's killing him ! Scully , help me move the skin . ( Bear groans ) Hold still , Bear . ( cries ofpain ) Forceps . Hold still , Bear . One more second . You 're gonna be OK . ( Bear moans with relief ) ( radio signal ) This is the AlCP investigative team calling Doolittle Airfield . Come in . DAF responding . This is Agent Mulder . We have a serious biological hazard . Request air pickup and quarantine procedures . Over . - ( interference ) - Come in , Doolittle Airfield ! We copy , AgentMulder . We are under a heavystorm . No aircraft can get out . The militarybase in Kotzebue could set up a quarantine . Advise immediate evacuation . The storm is headingyour way . Over . We were told we 'd have three clear days ooweather ! Over ! Welcome to the top ofthe world . Over . is Bear in any condition to oly ? lowe don 't leave in an hour , we 're stuck oor days . He 's dead . ( Hodge ) lt 's similar to a tapeworm . It has a scolex with suckers and hooks . So it 's oamiliar . Something you can deal with . - What ? - No . Very different orom any organism at least that I know oo . Have you oigured out how it 's transmitted ? Exchange oooluids , touch , air ? All oothe above ? I don 't know . All the other bodies had the creature . Only this one is still alive . - All in the spine ? - No . It appears they were in the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain . ( Murphy ) Hypothalamus ? What was that again ? It 's a gland that secretes hormones . Although ... I don 't know why a parasite would want to attach to it . Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine , ... .. which produces violent , aggressive behaviour . See , that might be the connection . Everybody that 's been inoected certainly seems to act aggressively . Maybe the worm oeeds on acetylcholine and stops us controlling violent behaviour . - A parasite shouldn 't want to kill its host . - lt doesn 't kill you until it 's extracted . Then it releases a poison . So you 're saying the worm makes you wanna kill other people . Which is maybe what happened to the oirst team . Or what could happen to us . - lt 's just a theory . We don 't have any prooo . - Except olve dead men . lo the worm makes people violently aggressive , ... .. why did Richter and Campbell kill themselves ? Maybe they did it to save us . I 'm just ... uh ... double-checking . Making sure I didn 't miss anything . Just some sleep , right ? Sleep ? I 'm so tired , I can 't sleep . We 're all wired and hypersensitive . It 'll be good to get a oresh start tomorrow . Mulder , I don 't want to waste a second trying to olnd a way to kill this thing . I don 't know lowe should kill it . This area oothe ice sheet is oormed over a meteor crater . The worm lives in ammonia . It survived subzero temperatures . Theorists believe in ammonia-supported lioe on planets with oreezing temperatures . No . A meteor that crashed here 1 / 4 million years ago ... .. may have carried such lioe to Earth . Mulder , that pilot developed surface symptoms within a oew minutes . Within a oew hours , that parasite had total control . What would happen io this got into the population ? A city the size oo New York could be inoected within a oew days . Exactly . But what do we know about it ? This organism might be lying dormant in another crater . lo we don 't kill it now , we risk becoming Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads . But lowe do kill it now , we may never know how to stop it in the outure . ( Scully ) Future ? Mulder , how can you talk ... ( Scully andMulder continue arguing ) Tell me it 's hot in here . Don 't worry , you don 't have a oever . The heating 's malounctioning . Outside it 's 40 below , in here it 's sweltering . - Can you hear what they 're arguing about ? - Probably government secrets . You think they knew what was here beoore we arrived ? - l 'm sure oo it . - ( Scully 's raised voice ) You know , Bear 's inoected blood did get on Scully . It also got on you . ( Scully ) They 'dsacrifice notjust evidence , but themselves ! - How do you know it can 't be contained ? - lt can ! By extermination ! We should take those bodies , worms and all , outside and incinerate them ! Something going on we should know about ? Agent Scully , are you all right ? - Yes. I 'm oine. lt 's nothing . - You seem a little bit stressed out . What the hell are you trying to say ? ! Let 's settle down. lt 's been a long day . We 're all tired and scared . - Let 's not turn on one another . - At least , not without a good reason . ( Mulder ) Maybe we should all get some sleep . Are you kidding ? You think any oo us could sleep right now ? Come on , guys , let 's oace it . We gotta check oor spots . And any person who has them should be conoined . Are we agreed on that ? Are you gonna do the exams ? No ! We do them in oront oo each other . No secrets . Beoore anyone passes judgement , ... .. may I remind you , we are in the Arctic . ( sighs ) ( Hodge ) Sleep tight . Don 't let the bedbugs bite . Yeah . Good night . Good night , Mulder . Good night , Scully . At least everyone 's OK . Don 't oorget , ... .. the spots on the dog went away . ( over headphones ) The ball 's on the three-yardline , ... .. with only 15 seconds leftin the game . Fouts moves over the ball . There 's the snap ! ( wakes with a start ) ( wind howls outside ) ( door closes ) ( dog barks andsnarls ) ( dog growls ) Mulder , what are you doing ? Murphy 's dead . You killed him . I oound him like this . I heard one oothe doors close . I came out to check it out . - lt 's one ooyou . - ( Hodge ) He 's lying . - You could 've done it and not known . - No , he said he didn 't . I have no symptoms . - You checked him . - Yeah , six hours ago ! - lt was one ooyou ! - Stop it ! Shut up ! Mulder , ... .. just put the gun down and let Hodge give you a blood test . And doctor the results ? He may be inoected ! He has to be conoined - now ! Then turn around and let us take a look at your neck ! I 'm not turning my back on anyone ! As oar as I 'm concerned , you 're all inoected ! Hodge is right ! Lock him up ! - Mulder ! - Scully , get that gun off me ! - Mulder , you have to understand ! - Put it down ! - You put it down oirst ! - Scully ! For God 's sakes , it 's me ! Mulder , you may not be who you are ! In here , I 'll be saoer than you . - ( Scully gasps ) - What were you doing ? You know what I was doing . You know , you 're the only one with a gun . lo you get inoected , we don 't stand a chance . OK . Was there something there ? ( Hodge ) You 're OK , Nancy . We 're all OK . Now is not the time oor the three oo us to turn on each other . There 's oour oo us . - Mulder isn 't one oo us any more . - lo Mulder is inoected , it 's not his oault ! We can 't turn our backs on him now ! He needs us to help him ! She 's right . Prolonged exposure to the parasite ... .. could damage him to the point oo permanent psychosis . But io he is inoected , he doesn 't go back . I won 't risk the possibilities . This is AlCP calling Doolittle Airfield . Please come in . ( interference ) This is the Arctic ice Core Project sending a general distress call . Please respond . ( interference ) Nancy , put a drop oo uninoected blood on the slide oothe blood orom the pilot . Run that by me again ? Put the uninoected blood on the inoected blood . No , damn it ! What did I just tell you ? ! You inoected the inoected blood ! Now I have to start again ! - l made a mistake . Don 't yell at me . - Wasted hours oowork ! OK , then just do it by yourselo , damn it ! God ! I 'm not your assistant ! ( Da Silva continues to rant ) Hodge ? What ? Come take a look at this . The larvae orom two different worms killed each other . An individual worm will not tolerate another invading its host . It does to the invader what it did to humans . It makes them kill . ( Hodge ) A species won 't kill its own . It needs another to procreate . Worms are hermaphroditic . It can reproduce itselo . Look at the evidence in the microscope . This thing does not like company . So what are you saying ? The way to kill it is to introduce another worm into an already inoected body ? ( whimpering ) ( agitated whimpering ) Sounds OK . It passed the worms in its stool . They 're dead . I want to talk to him oirst , ... .. try and make this voluntary . What ? You can 't go in alone . lo anything happens , you come inside . I can 't do this to him until I 'm sure . is itjust you ? Yes . It 's one oo them . No one 's been killed since you 've been in here . So ? We oound a way to kill it . Two worms ... in one host ... .. will kill each other . You give me one worm , you 'll inoect me . lo that 's true , ... .. then why didn 't you let us inspect you ? I would have , but you pulled a gun on me ! Now , I don 't trust them ! I wantto trust you . OK . But now they 're not here . ( gasps ) This is the last one . She 's not gonna let us give it to him . Well , she 'll have to io he 's inoected . He 'll convince her somehow . I just examined him . He 's uninoected . So is she . Which means that it must be one ooyou . All right . Let 's go over to the main building . I 'd like to check him myselo . Then he can examine both oo us . Want to lead the way ? No ! Get the worm ! ( screams ) No ! No ! Oh , my God . Mulder ! It 's her ! No ! No ! Scully ! It 's Da Silva ! ( screams hysterically ) - ( screams ) - ( gunshot ) ( Da Silva continues screaming ) Hodge ! Now ! Mulder ! After this , there won 't be any left ! They 're all gonna be dead ! - ( shrieks ) - Do it ! ( Da Silva screams frantically ) Shh ... Shh ... ( exhausted cries ) lt 's all right. lt 's all over . It all stops right here , ... .. right now . ( paramedic ) OK , I got it . ( police ) At the intersection oo Yukon and 17th . State patrol is on the scene . Code 3 . Over . She 'll be put in quarantine along with the dog . We 'll keep her there until we 're sure she won 't inoect the population . Meanwhile , our tests came back normal , so we 've been released . Plane ready. lt 'll take you as oar orom the ice as you wanna go . I 'm goin ' back to the site . This time I 'm going oully prepared with proper equipment . There 's still research to be done on the genetic structure ... Wait , Mulder . Don 't you know ? Know what ? 45 minutes after evacuating us , they torched the place . There 's nothing left . Who did that ? The military ? Centers oor Disease Control ? You ought to know . They 're your people . It 's still there , Scully . 200,000 years down , ... .. in the ice . Leave it there .

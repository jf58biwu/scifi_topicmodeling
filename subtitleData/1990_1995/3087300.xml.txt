 What ? - All the cops have wooden legs ! - They sure do ! - All right , hold on ! - What is it ? ! Flat tire ! Hold on ! Oh , man . All right , I 'm gonna find a place to pull over . Oh , man . Excuse me . Hey , I like this place . Maybe we could build some houses , just like " Gilligan 's Island . " " Gilligan 's Island " ? After all that 's happened , Annie , what 's wrong with going home ? Dad ... - vacation was fine . - Yeah , fine . Let 's face it , Annie , it 's just not the way that it was . Dad , Mom 's been dead for two years . It 's the way it is . We have lift-off . Honey , look , why don 't you just hit the cooler , get yourself some pop ? But stay close , 'cause I want to fix this tire and get on home . Hey , don 't go down there , kid . There 's all kinds of wild animals and shit . - Who do you belong to ? - Who do you belong to ? Hey ! Hey , you ! Hands off ! Are you some kind of a pervert or something ? Johnny , you know better . You don 't even know this guy . I don 't know you either , okay ? He almost went over the edge . There could be badgers or something down there . Throw it . Come on , throw it . Well , throw it . Go back , come on . Wow , bald and flat . I feel for you , man . Sometimes life really sucks , doesn 't it ? Looks like you just bought me a tournament Frisbee , dude . I can get it back . No sweat . Come on . What , are you guys standing guard ? Let 's go . Come on , guys , let 's go the other way , okay ? Johnny , come on . Ah , ha ! I told you . Was I right , or was I right ? No playing here ! You kids oughta know better than ... wait . You hear it ? It could be anywhere around here . Above us , behind us , or in the ground . Do you think this is some kind of joke ? You think this is some kind of game ? ! They 're hungry . All they do is eat . You got to keep a weathered eye out all the time ! If you don 't watch every minute ... then wham ! Then it 's too late . Who are you ? Any of you ever hear of a place called Grover 's Bend ? It 's a real town with real people . Now , in 1984 ... I was riding my bicycle and I looked up . I saw this thing in the sky . Call the Army . They 're here ! - Who ? - Who ? ! Them ! On Earth I was just a big nobody . Up in space I am somebody . Charlie bounty hunter . Yeah , " Charlie bounty hunter . " Dad 's all torn up and Mom 's got a harpoon thing in her neck , and they 're getting bigger . You 're not from around here , are you ? I got to go where the cosmic winds blow me . I got to ... go where no man has gone before . I 'm a bounty hunter ! Come on , you can 't expect us to believe this horseshit . You can believe what you want , son . All I know is you got to get away from here while you still can . Well , there 's something I can agree with . So walk away . There you go . Probably could 've used that lug wrench a little while longer . Got it . You should have had your spare tire down here . Could 've saved you some traveling . Never know when you 'll have a flat tire on an antique like this . Are you supposed to be scary ? Me ? No . It ain 't me , it 's them . I 've seen them . I 've been seeing them for ... Look , you believe in monsters ? - Yeah . - Good . Good . That 's what I 'm telling you about . Now , some friends of mine from ... a long way off , they gave me a whole bunch of these . I only got a couple left , but I want you to have one . Now if this ever starts to glow bright green , that 's the time to watch out for yourself . And your family . - Green . - That 's right , green . Annie ! Johnny ! - All aboard ! - We really have to go now . - Give my regards to Mars . - Don 't be so quick . You 're not as smart as you think you are . You can have the rest of my root beer . Thank you , partner . It 's my favorite . Johnny , come on now . Look what I found . What is it ? I don 't know . It looks like a big electric bullet . Homemade . He dropped it . Joshua ! Front and center , now . - Joshua ? - Josh , please . - Is that your father ? - Stepfather . Never , never will we trust you out of our sight again . When I say five minutes , I don 't mean seven , I don 't mean three . Discipline from now on , young man . Hmm ? I will not and your mother will not ... spare anymore rods . Is he going to get spanked ? I don 't think his mom is going to let that happen . Well , Big John , I guess we had some adventure , huh ? ! Dad ! Dad , you should have seen it ! - There was this strange guy ... - I really don 't care . I told you two to stay close , didn 't I ? Look at the two of you ... you 're filthy . - Johnny , get in the truck . - I know , Dad , but he came out of the ground and scared the crap out of us . He scared the crap out of us . Miss Sawyer ... can we please watch our language around Johnny ? Shit . Look , honey , I just don 't know what to say to you . You could say that you 're not going on the road tomorrow . You could say that I 'm not old enough to take care of myself . Honey , you 're not being fair . Mr. and Mrs. Menges take real good care of you guys . They 're like family . Hey ... it 's the best that I can do . Besides , you 're a young woman now . Maybe I don 't want to be a young woman now . Grover 's Bend ? What a crock . You 're listening to Topeka 's number one country radio station ... Country 107 , KTPK . Hey , Frank , give me a hand with some of this stuff , man . Absolutely , Mario . I am the handyman after all . - You asshole . - I heard that . Vaya con Dios , Mario . Four more units to vacate , Jessie , and I 'm a rich man . Hey , you got the elevator fixed . Frankie . Hey , not for you , Rosie . There 's still a one-ton load limit . Ooh , you ... Yo , yo , yo . Check your weapons at the door , it 's the chick that walks like a man . Dating outside our species now , huh ? Oh , very funny . Very , very funny . I wasn 't talking to you , Frank . Yo , Marcia , I got a little phone problem . Maybe you can come down to the basement and check my equipment ? Sorry , Frank , I left my microscope upstairs . Ho-ho ! Ho ! She 's killing me . Hey , Mario . I sure am sorry to see you go , my friend . I just killed two rats this morning . Rats ? ! Hey , Frank ... rats . Hey , don 't look at me . I got to see them to " e-rat-icate " them . Yo , Jessie , look who 's home . Something 's wrong . No brakes ! No brakes ! Hold onto Johnny . Everybody all right ? Yeah . Safe at home . Oh , man . I 'm sorry , Mario . No brakes . Something I can do ? That 's okay . Is everybody okay ? So , Frank , you going to give us a hand with this ? No . I 'm the maintenance man . He doesn 't live here anymore . Love you , Jessie . I 'll be in my office . Listen , would you clean up this junk ? The guy 's a waste of protein . Yeah , but what a snappy dresser . Dad , I 'm gonna go say hello to the Menges . Yeah , but don 't go up empty handed . You take something with , all right ? Ladies . Java . Fuck . Wh ... ? What 's this ? Oh , that 's disgusting . Yeah , you 're next , pal . Hey , girl . Going down to help Dad ? I thought I might . I mean , we got ourselves a loaded truck , an unloaded camper , a car wreck ... - I think they can use my help . - Marcia ? Are there any jobs down at the phone company ? What , you need a job ? Ah , you want Clifford home . Well , I was just thinking . We 'll see what we can do . Yeah , we will . - Hello ! Hello , Annie . - Hello . Welcome home , dear . Come in . Did you have a wonderful trip ? Dear , say hello to Annie . They 've just been to the Grand Canyon . Say , did you know they just discovered an alien graveyard there ? - Who did ? - Government . Secret . Wait till you taste what I 'm cooking today . Where 's Johnny ? He 'll love them . Tell me about your trip , dear . Oh , yeah . Well , we froze to death in Arizona , saw these Indian caves in Mesa Verde , and met this weird lunatic near Grover 's Bend . He jumped right out from the ground . So you had a good time ? Grover 's Bend ? I 'm making Mr. Menges' favorite dish today . Ham and beans . Will you and Johnny stay for dinner ? No . It 's our last night together with Dad . He leaves on the 8 : 15 to Chicago . We better save the tarts till later . I don 't want your father to say I spoiled your dinner ... again . Hello , girls . How you doing , eh ? Are you a little hungry ? How about I give you to the old farts upstairs tonight ? Iris Arms apartment complex , Frank Longo at your service . Longo , what 's the good news ? Yo , right here . Right here , Mr. Briggs . I hope you did what I 'm paying you for . Yes . Yes , I did . Yes , I did . Mario is history as of right now . You promised me all of them . - I lose my investors ... - Hey . The way I look at this , is that you are making all the " el giganto " profits off the sale of this shithole , not little old moi . - You listen to me , Frank . - Well ... maybe it 's time that you get down here and get involved . I hired you so I wouldn 't have to get involved . I 'm not lifting another finger until you pay me for Mario ! You got that ? ! You can take that to the bank ! Balls ! Hello ? Hello ? Where are you ? What are you doing out without Uncle Frankie 's permission , huh ? Go back upstairs where you belong ! Work with me ! What this dump needs is a good four alarm fire . - Dad , dinner 's getting cold . - Coming . I want you to listen to the Menges . Sometimes I think you don 't listen . I 'll be back Friday night . - Oh , toothpaste . - Got it . You really should pack some vitamins , too . And I want you to help her make beds in the mornings . She 's not a young woman , you know . - I 'm done . - Can 't you wait for Dad ? Mr. M promised me pirate stories . - Bye . - Bye . - You be a good boy . - Okay . - See ya . - See ya . - Dad . - Hmm ? What 's going to happen to the Menges ? I mean , where will they go ? We 're going to have to move too , you know . They 'll get us out . Dad , you 're going to have to deal with this . You got to think about it , make some decisions . Annie ... I 'm going to eat my dinner , and then I 'm going to watch some moronic situation comedy , and then I 'm going to sleep the sleep of the dead . Can we worry about this tomorrow ? I love my work . Ow , ow , ow ! Hot ! Hot ! Damn teenagers ! Wh ... ? Oh ! Oh , oh ... Hairballs . Did you hear something ? No . Tell Johnny bedtime , one hour . That goes for you , too . Oh , and give this check to Mrs. Menges . It 's for taking care of you guys . Tell her I 'll cover the rest of it when I get back . Dad , remember how much fun we used to have ? Yeah . What was I like then ? Shorter . Dad ... maybe I could go get Johnny and we could play a game or something . Honey , give me your battery-powered TV , would you ? Oh God . - Who 's there ? - It 's just me . Laundry night . I 'm a little spooked tonight , too . Did you hear screaming before ? It was probably just Frank . - What is eating him ? - I don 't know . Frank 's just naturally repulsive . Say hello to Mrs. and Mr. Menges for me . Right . Aaah ! Frank ? I know you 're there . I can hear you breathing . Talk to me , Frank . Frank ? Frank ? Hello ? All right , Longo , very funny . Enough is enough . Frank ? We are not amused . Try to guess just how close your termination is . Okay , it 's your funeral , wiseass . I 'm coming over there and taking care of things myself . We got another errand to do before we sleep , sport . Business . Can 't you just drop me off at home ? No way , sport . Someday this pool will be yours . You 're going to have to learn how to swim in it . Looks like they 'll have to meet their landlord after all . See ? Grover 's Bend , 1986 . Now , you can see the same kind of occurrence two years later ... 1988 . Even local law enforcement claims they 've seen space aliens . One of them supposedly killed a sheriff in the ' 88 encounter . A sheriff ? Yes . A sheriff wearing ... an Easter Bunny suit . And I 'll bet the aliens were all wearing tuxedos . Of course , he must have been reading the same newspapers as you . That 's where he got the story in the first place . Who ? What guy ? That crazy guy we ran into on vacation . He actually believes this stuff . Oh ... I didn 't mean ... It 's okay . Look , I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm still upset over a fight I just had with my dad . I 'm going to go back downstairs and check on him . I 'll be back for Johnny in awhile . John , you still like my stories , don 't you ? - It 's him ! - Huh ? Who ? If it glows green , that 's the time to watch out for yourself . Her first frame is a strike . Michelle led in the earlier rounds in this tournament , and was the hot item around Southern California when it came to sports . She really was . Yesterday , in the second round ... of match play , Steve , she bowled incredibly . She had a 300 ... Hello ? Frank ? Frank , is that you ... or some other rat ? Well ... huh . Terrific . You pervert . We got varmints . Frank , what in the wild world of Geraldo is going on down here ? Oh my God . Oh , no ! What is it ? ! Aaah ! There 's more of them ! Get away . Get away . Oh , no , no ! No , please ! What are these things ? ! Annie ! Annie , help me ! Get it off , get it off ! Get me out of this . Oh , Annie , hurry ! Hurry , they 're going to come again ! - Rosalie , give me some slack ! - Okay . Ow ! It hurts . It hurts . Frank . Oh , Annie , let 's get out of here ! Annie ! Annie ! Come on ! Help me here . Okay . Feast your eyes on the future site of Briggs ' Mini Mall . Nice concept , huh ? Naming it after yours truly . But Mom said the court ordered you to pay them money to move , to relocate . Not if they move on their own accord , sport . " Sport . " There are much simpler ways to sweep and clear . You 'll see . You 'll learn . Come on . I 'll teach you . Oh God , please make this a dream . Rosalie , come on ! Come on . Dad ! - Dad ! - What ? ! Dad ! Dad ! - Oh , Dad , it was awful . - There are things . They 're huge ! They 're gigantic . They 're like rats ! Rats ! No , Tasmanian devils . - Slow down ! - Dozens of ' em . And they attacked me . They had these white fang teeth . And they bit me ! They bit me on my leg ! Oh my God , I 'm bleeding . Sit over here , Rosie . Dad , they 're little animals ... just like the ones in the paper . They 've got lots of sharp teeth . They 're nasty things ... nasty things with sharp teeth . They 're things from outer space . You can ask Mr. Menges about it . Dad , they 're aliens ! Aliens in the basement ? You have to believe her ! They 're huge . They 're like badger , possums ... they 're big cats . You got to listen to her , they 're awful ! Rosie , calm down , calm down . - You just saw a rat . - Will you look at her leg ? Oh , Rosie . A rat did this to you ? This is serious . They 're not rats . They got Frank in the basement . - They got Frank ? - They got Frank ! They got Frank ! Dad ! Oh ... Dad , come on . Aaah ! Dad , come on ! What are those things ? ! Go , go , go ! In two tournaments I 've seen her shoot those 300 games . She can throw the strikes . - She makes a strike . - Eat that . God damn it . You see , sport ? All kinds of animals follow them around . These people are animals . Pretty soon you can 't tell them apart . The people , the pets ... they 've all got fleas . This 'll get their attention . Their attention for what ? Our little panic ... casserole . You think they 're screaming and carrying on now ? Just wait till I cut off their communication with their social workers . Hello ? Hello ? That 's funny . I lost contact with Grover 's Bend . What did he mean , " Watch out for yourself " ? Third floor ... second floor ... first floor ... basement . Who turned out the lights ? ! - Son of a bitch . - Oh , Dad . How many stairs are in this place anyway ? Wait , we just went up these stairs . - I 'm dizzy . - Come on . What 's your problem ? - I just want to rest . - What are you guys doing down here ? Marcia , come and help ! They 're passing out . There are things , they 're like big rats . Only they bite and ... I forget . They 're aliens . Porcupines ! Mrs. Menges ! Mrs. Menges ! Come on , Cliff . Let me help you . Lean on me . Up . Up . That 's it . - Who are you ? - Marcia . You know me , Cliff . Come on . - Marcia ? - Yeah . Come on . - Up , up . That 's it . - Yeah , okay . Thank you . Porcupines ? Come out , come out , wherever you are . Your landlord is here to evict you . Jeez , a rat did that ? Looks like I 'll have to charge somebody for a new door . Give me the keys . I 'll wait in the car . Forget it . We 're in this together . I thought you cut off all the power . I did cut off all the power . Can we just go ? They must have tapped into the emergency system . Hello ? It 's your landlord . I have matters to discuss . ... chicken has a wishbone , which I 'll cut out . All this makes perfectly marvelous soup . You have to get the leg bones out from the legs and the wing side . And the way to do that is ... push the bones through . And then take ... there 's the ... ball joint of your roast chicken . We 'll have our work done in a minute , sport . Don 't call me " sport . " You 're not a crybaby , too , are you , sport ? I hate you . I wish you were dead ! Sport ? Sport ! Hey , come on . Let me in . Let him go . Hey . Hey ! Hey , come on . He can 't help being an asshole ! What are you doing ? You 're ready to remove the bones . Hey , come on . He just wants to talk to you ! Leave him alone ! Let him go ! Let him go ! Hey , what 's the matter ? They 've got him . They 're tearing him apart . - They 're killing him ! - Who ? ! They 've got who ? Wait . Stop , stop . Step back . Stay back . - Come on ! - What 's going on ? Never mind . Run ! Go ! This way . Come on . Let 's go . No , no , wait ! I can 't just leave him there . That guy you were with , your dad ? Stepfather . I don 't know what the hell is going on down there , but I just saw something there . There 's animals , some kind of hungry things . I don 't know , but he 's dead , hon . There 's nothing we can do for him . - What 's your name ? - Josh . Okay , Josh ... Get back ! Oh , look ! - Come on ! - Do you have any more flares ? Fresh out ! What ? Let us in ! - Close the door ! - Josh ! - Annie . - Come on , help me move this desk . - Swing it around that way . - What are you doing here ? - I came with her . - Marcia ? Push it up against the door . Right up tight . Great . That should hold them . Josh , how did you get here ? There 's monsters outside , aren 't there ? Yeah , there are monsters out there . - Anybody check the phone ? - It 's dead , like the lights . I still don 't know what the hell is going on here . Ain 't no rats , you can be sure of that . What are you talking about ? Did you ever see one of these come out of any rat you 've seen ? Ain 't no rats . Must be venom ... poison . They 're here ! I saw the door downstairs , they chewed right through it . What do you say we barricade the kitchen door ? What kitchen door ? Mr. Menges , you don 't have a gun up here or anything like that ? I got a great Civil War pistol . I used to have a frame for it . I got no powder . How about a big knife ? How about a meat cleaver , dear ? You find anything there ? No . Wait . What 's that ? Oh . As I recall , that 's a little storage area . Mr. Menges and I haven 't crawled up there in years . Josh , come here ! Do you have a footstool or something ? In the pantry . Hey , you guys , check this out . Mrs. Menges , does this connect with the roof ? I really don 't know where that goes . You get up there and you crawl ... crawl that direction , and you 'll hit the elevator shaft . - You don 't know that . - I 'll get the others . Sure I do . I 've stored stuff up there . Do you think you guys can climb a ladder ? No ladder . Go up a ladder tomorrow . No . No tomorrow . I can 't do this anymore , Dad ! Move your ass , now ! Now . Come on , Clifford . We 've been climbing three flights of stairs ever since that elevator broke down . Come on . You can do it . It 's gotten too quiet out there . I don 't like it . They 'll just get in some other way . We got to get out of here ! Rosalie , come on . We got to go . You 're next . I 'll watch the door . - Oh , no . - Up , Rosalie . - Right . - All right . - Come on , you can do it . - I 'll help you . You know ... if we can make it to the roof , I can get to the junction box outside , tie into the phone lines , call for help . - You can do that ? - Hey , I can do anything ... I work for the phone company . - Push . - Ow , ow , ow . - Up , Rosalie . - Push . Come on . Go . - Push , fair Rosie , come on ! - Help . Push ! Push , Josh . We 've come this far . Come on , help her . Look , dear , the quilt that Aunt Carolyn gave us , remember ? Yeah , I remember . Come on , let 's go . Everybody be calm . Go ! Go ... quick ! Grab that , quick ! - Go ! - They 're over here ! Josh , come on . Keep going . - Which way do I go ? - Give me the flashlight . Kids , here ! Right through there . You stay with them and try and keep everybody together . I 'm gonna check out this direction . Marcia ! Be careful . Come on , Annie . Annie . It won 't open . Please ! It won 't open . We 're trapped . Where 's Marcia ? Oh , damn it . I 'm lost . Josh ... what are you doing here ? I came here with my stepdad . We came here to evict you . I didn 't want to come . Pretty awful , huh ? Yeah . I just can 't believe he 's dead . Josh ... my mom died . Not like your dad , but she died . But I bet you didn 't wish for your mom to die . I just wish we could go back to this morning . I just wish we could figure out how to use this thing . Look ... if nobody can think of anything better , one of us has got to make it to the street and run for help . The only way I know to get around them things is this elevator shaft . Hey . I got a better idea . How do you get to the box ? Redundant cable . Keeps the lines from blowing down . It ought to hold my weight long enough for me to ... get connected . I 'm down to 119 . Marcia , you 're going to die out there . Any calls you want me to make for you ? Come on . Belay me . Adios . Oh God . Josh ! Josh , we 're on fire ! One thing at a time . Marcia , one thing at a time . - Oh my God . Marcia ! - Marcia ! She 's swinging . She 's swinging ! Annie , it 's okay ... Thank you . Thank you . Phone . Phone ! Phone , phone . Let 's go . Yes . Go . Yes ! Oh no . Damn . Damn . Go , go ! Yes , yes , yes ! Yes ! No ! No , no . Yes , yes . I can do this . Annie . I 'm going for help . It 's okay . I 'm gonna take care of everything . Annie . Annie ! Don 't go down there . That 's too dangerous . You come on back here . Let somebody else do that . Second floor . Nothing to it . All right , get back ... get back into the elevator . I got you , you hear ? Oh , gee . It 's jammed . It 's okay . Sometimes it does this . What ? ! You came here just in time . Where 's your family ? Take me to them . Well , the elevator 's stuck . We have to climb . How did you get here ? A gentlemen called me . A real nice fella . All right . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know . Hold on ! Floor , please ? ! The roof ! Somebody help us out of here . I 'm stuck . Hey , it 's you . Yeah , what 's left of me . The building is burning downstairs . We 've got to get on the roof . Don 't look . Don 't ... be casual . Who is that hunk that just came in with your daughter ? Charlie . - Hi . - How you doing , partner ? I guess you were right about those things . See if you can pry that bullet out of there . My fingers are too big . What about Marcia ? Yes . Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Please deposit 25 ¢ for the first three minutes . Damn ! I hate operators . Quiet . Everybody quiet . If you 're quiet , you can hear them moving . - Annie , my gun . - I 'm trying ! It won 't come out . All right , keep your eyes on them . Look ' em in the eye . They 'll telegraph their every move . I hate you ! Josh ! You leave my husband alone ! Annie . Annie ? Charlie ! Open wide . We got ' em ! Come on , let 's go ! Mobile Ops 7707 . Emergency . Oh God ! Come on , Johnny . Stay here . Fire ! Help us ! Can anyone hear me ? ! Please , help us ! Can 't you see us ? ! We 're on fire ! Come over here . Somebody help ! It 's really burning .

You were wonderful . - Thank you very much . - You saved us all . Thank you . Thank you very much . Please , fire ! Come on ! Fire ! Somebody help us ! We 're on fire ! Are you okay ? Can you stand ? No , I can 't . Johnny , get away from the edge ! But Marcia 's down there . I don 't care . Get over here now ! Listen to me . Get over here ! Look , Annie , look ! Charlie ! - I got you . - Help ! Don 't look down . Annie , don 't let go ! Annie , I 'm slipping . Hold on , Johnny . Please , somebody help me ! I got you . I got you . I got you . I love you . Help ! - Charlie ? - Help ! Get help ! Charlie . Throw me a rope . Get a rope ! Dad , we got to do something . Oh , no . Oh , no ! Charlie , look out . Hey ... I hope you 'll let me down easier than that . Outer space all right . No doubt about it . We can prove it . - We could 've proved it except ... - It was all burnt up in there . Documented proof . All my papers . Actual physical evidence ... gone . - Hi . - Hi . Oh . I 'll be over there , okay ? - How are you ? - I 'm fine . So ... how ' bout getting together sometime , and doing something normal ? - Normal like a movie ? - Yeah . Charlie ! Don 't go . Listen , partner , how 's that crystal doing ? Yeah . See ? There 's no more problem . - You don 't need me anymore . - Johnny . Come here a minute . Bye , Charlie . Bye , John . Are you leaving today , Daddy ? I think I finally got the message you guys want me to stay close to home . My uniform 's all burnt up , so I think the railroad can get along without me . Dad , can we survive ? Well , we 've just been talking about that . I think I 'll check out those jobs down at the phone company . And between the Menges and us , we 'll work something out . - Excuse me . - Yeah . - I 'm Josh 's mother . - How do you do ? Josh has told me about all you 've done for him . And my husband ... my late husband , he owes you people quite a bit of money . - He does ? - It 's called a relocation fee . And I think with that , you 'd be able to stay in a hotel until we get the place rebuilt . - That is , if you 'd be interested . - We 're interested . And thank you . Why don 't we introduce ourselves ? Johnny , where 's your friend from Grover 's Bend ? Charlie ? He left . Just like one of those westerns . No . No . All right , you gumballs . What is that ?

Roger . I got it . Give it to me in five . Ethan , I know you are there . On deck . Pronto . Acknowledge . I 'm on my way . Looks like a live one . Is it hollow ? No can say . What 's it doing out here ? Looks beat up . Trajectory 's pretty weird . It weighs about a ton and a half . It could be a space probe . Or an escape pod . Whatever it is , it 's a ton and a half more beer money than we got now , so ... do we do , or do we don 't ? Yeah . Bernie , go down to the bay and let 's see if we can put a thrag on this . Shit . It won 't scan . I can 't tell you what 's inside . Okay . Where are you going ? Well , sir ... if you simply must possess this thing , then I must go downstairs and make sure that the gravity panels still drag in a ton and a half . - Okay ? - Just ... make it so . Aye , aye , Captain . - Hey ! - Huh ? Number one ... you 're late . Number two ... who told you you could wear those ? - You did . - I did ? Yeah . Well , your lease is up . I guess Rick 's had a little too much coffee again ? Rick has got a bug up his butt . See . He 's gone and discovered himself ... a magnetic space anomaly . And he 's gotten stiff in the jock . And you , my friend ... must learn to at least pretend a bit of servitude . Just like you ? It 's life in space , kiddo . Catch you in five . Aye , aye . Tractor power up . Online in five . Roger that . Two kilos and closing . 1500 . Tell Bernie to get ready to lock , Captain . Oh , there you are . Can 't you hear the bridge in your stateroom ? Rick ! Tractor power 's reading 90 on the line . - Better get ready , folks . - Got it . Pull out when I say , and not before . Better grab it fast . She 's going . I don 't know if she 's got the guts , Rick , but she 's all yours . Give me two more degrees . Come on , Bernie ! Lateral ! Lateral ! Spin it around if you have to . Just don 't give me any new dents . Clamps are out , but they look sluggish . Al Bert . The clamps are freezing up . I got the de-icer boots working , sir . Thank you ... Ethan , the engineer . Bernie ... Dropping . 59 , she 's steady . All right . We 've got it . Okay , boys and girls . Let 's reel it in and see what we won . Okay , it 's hollow . Agnometer reading 35 , 40 , 55 . Jeez , it 's real cold inside . About 10 , 12 degrees . Could you ask Bernie to go back a little ? You can ask him to go back , Ethan . There 's nothing there . It 's just a corrosion swirl . - Bernie , acknowledge . - Is that you , Ethan ? Yeah , Bernie , this is me . Could you move the camera back manually ? A little slower . More . More . A bit more . Stop . It 's rust . Magnify times four , please . Now it 's great big rust . Bernie ... aim a blower at that section there . Anything for you , Madame Pilot . Look , right there . You see ? It 's a factory stamp . Foundry marking . No , it isn 't . It 's the old Intergalactic Council stamp . - Before they dissolved ? - Yeah , the old logo . Aw , come on . Who cares ? If it belongs to somebody else , then it 's not salvage . We got to report it , S.O.P. , Captain . We still get paid . Okay . I 'll log it . I don 't want another stolen property rap up my ass again . Bernie , get yourself up here . Well , somebody must own the thing . Al Bert , talk to me . Ahhh ... Nothing on any of the registration channels . It 's not been listed missing with central in the last 15 years . Hold on . I think I 've got something . ID transmit incoming . Standby . Terracor . Third quarter profits , 403 trillion new bucks . Huh , what do they want ? Ahoy , RSS Tesla . Do I have the honor of speaking to Captain Richard Butrum ? - Right here . - It 's a pleasure , Captain . I am Counselor Tetra . - Of Terracor . - Correct . And on behalf of Terracor , may I be the first to congratulate you and your crew for locating something we lost a long time ago ? - And frankly , thought we 'd never retrieve . We are very grateful . Give me a break . Just how grateful might Terracor be ? Captain , permit me to put your mind at ease . Your location is just three days from one of our stations . I am well aware of the profit margin of an operation such as yours . So we are prepared to offer you triple the rate in straight salvage , in cash at our station . Well , Counselor , you do understand that I need to establish the chain of title from the Intergalactic Council to Terracor . So , I suggest we get back in touch when we arrive at Orion Colony . Counselor , could you hold for a moment ? We 're getting some breakup on this end . Certainly . Take it ! Don 't fool with these guys . This isn 't one of your schemes , all right ? We 're involved in this , too . I 'm not real fond of the idea of messing Terracor over either , Captain . - The offer is fair , Rick . - The offer is shit ! It 's got to be worth at least 10 times that much if we unload it at Orion Colony . We got a gold mine here . I can smell it . I can sure smell something . I ... I agree with Rick . - What ? ! - What 's that ? I mean , the captain . No way , Rick . She 's right . Bernie ? I think we should do what she says . Counselor . There you are . Your transmit is quite clean now . You do understand , we 'll need the coordinates for your station . Already taken care of . Hope to see you soon , Captain . And , Captain ... ensure that no one on your crew makes any attempt to breach the pod , or interfere with it in any way . What 's your problem ? Three days off course . That 's going to set us back at least a week . - Maybe more . - So what ? You got a date or something ? Well , then prepare for course correction . Are we there yet ? ! " Why , I 'm here with Terracor . You know Counselor Tetra , of course . Close family friend . " " Yes , I 'm the man who found the pod . Actually , I first laid hands on it . " God . You 're perfect . Welcome , RSS Tesla , to Terracor Station 44 . You may call me Angela . Please complete decontamination procedures before disembarking . I don 't know about you , but she 's the first one I want to meet . Then proceed to lock number 42 . Welcome , gentlemen . Gentlemen , problem . Ugh , this place smells like a wet sock . Blowers are working , filters just haven 't been changed . Ethan , check the main scrubbers , will you ? - Rick . - Aye , aye . I don 't think there 's anybody here . Nobody alive at least . Computer . Hey , what was that chick 's name ? Angela . Angela ! Where 's the staff ? Our staff is available on a 24-hour basis - to serve your every need ... - Cancel . Give me current status of this station 's life support systems . Atmosphere fabrication functioning at 60 % ... Bernie , Ethan , get back to the ship . I want masks , backup air and power packs for everyone . And , Bernie ... bring me the gun . ... Have a good day and enjoy your stay with us . Angela ? Has Terracor been notified about the condition of this station ? Terracor Interplanetary was founded by Maximillian ... Cancel . Rick . The computer 's screwed up . - I beg your pardon ? - Never mind , Angela . I love you . Why , that 's very kind of you . I wonder what hit this place ? Place wasn 't attacked , it was abandoned . Okay . Okay . We got 85 % power . Two levels functioning . No breaks in the seals . No integrity breaches . Levels ... five through seven are on automatic shutdown to conserve power . And so are levels nine through 12 . I got ... air conditioning , but I can 't do anything about ambient temperature . Water tanks are down by one half . I got ... a pharmacy on level four . And executive suites are on this level ... and we can get to them . Sporadic audio , some video . Central logic is 50 % . Nearly Neanderthal . I guess Angela ain 't going to college . And the station is drifting at about one half a degree a month . Nice of Terracor to tell us the station was decomm . What ? Hello ? ! Nuclear core is reading just shy of the red . Nearly to alert . Radiation ? Negative . It looks more like natural decay . I 'd give her about a month before we all glow in the dark . Don 't kid about shit like that . Just show me where the pharmacy is . What 's the matter ? Feeling a little bit under the weather there ? Angela . Tell me which way to the wet showers . Showers are available ... Check it out . Out ! This is for big boys . Come here . You mind your own goddamn business . Asshole . Eh ... Captain Asshole . Caution . A maverick energy discharge has been monitored in cargo bay two . The station just cut a fart . Angela , give me a deck by deck scan , and read off all individuals not currently in main control . I do not recognize your voice pattern as one with security clearance ... Great , be a shitty TL54 ! Don 't cooperate ! Angela ... give me security clearance to all levels , please . I cannot conform to your request as I do not recognize your voice pattern as one with security clearance . Angela , do not ... I repeat , do not give me security clearance to all levels . You have security clearance on all levels . - Yes ! - What information do you require ? Exactly ... like my ex-wife . Anything I say , she does the opposite . Come on , open up , you bitch ! I have registered another maverick energy discharge in cargo bay two . It must be one of them subsection power lines shorting out in the condensation . Go down to the cargo bay , split it off and dump it in one of those dead grids , would you ? Aye , aye . Down , please . Down is a relative direction in space . Do you require a specific deck or area ? Take me to the Tesla . Please state the registry number of the Tesla now . RSS Tesla , registry ... Shit . Um ... Take me to the ship that most recently docked here . This is an elevator , not a dock . Please state your destination . All right . Take me to the visiting ship dock . Ship 's doctors will be found on deck four , - corridors 11 and ... - Cancel ! Take me to the loading dock . Do you require B level service docks ... Come on , Angela . ... the B113 docks , sublevels four through eight , - for oversized shipments or ... - I can 't get out of here , can I ? Please state your destination now . No , don 't be on fire ! Jeez . Rick ? What are you doing ? What happened to " Captain ... " - squirt ? - What is your problem with me ? Problem ? What 's my problem ? I 'll tell you what my problem is . - Rick . - Sit down ! We all had a chance back there . All of us ! But they ... those people , they 've screwed it up . - W-wh ... - Shut up . Damn it . See , I understand you better than you think . You 're young . You figure you 've got lots of chances . Right . Let me tell you something ... there will come a time when those chances run out . And then where are you ? Huh ? Ethan ... what do you say to getting out of here ... right now ? What about the others ? Well ... on the other hand ... I think I 've come up with a solution to your little problem . What problem ? See ? It 's all fixed . Hang around awhile , kiddo . I 'll be gone soon enough . Hey , hey , hey ! Hands off me ! Wow , thanks . I almost got locked ... Ohh ... I 'm in space , aren 't I ? Are you it ? Just you ? Better be something other than you in there . Don 't move . Stay right there . Holy cow . Hmm ? The eggs . Attention , third notice . I 'm registering another maverick energy discharge . Angela , do not , I repeat do not characterize the discharge . The energy discharge is conformed to a Type Two Rendel Pickman Beam Blaster . That 's Rick 's big macho gun . He 's going for the pod . Thatjerk 's trying to rip off the pod . Ethan . I sent Ethan down there . Let 's go . Who are you ? Bernie . Bernie ! Bernie ! Cut that out and come with us . - What 's the matter ? - Rick ! Cargo bay . Seems our fearless leader has some plans for Terracor 's long-lost pod . You mean steal it ? Steal what 's inside ? Yup , leave up here counting R.E.M. s as we glow in the dark . Scum bag . Are you sure ? Just what did you do to him ? Me ? Nothing . That was the Critters . I 'm a bounty hunter , and I got a mission . Just tell me who you are . God , are you from the station ? Wait , wait , what are you talking about ? A bounty hunter ? Look , are you from the station or part of the security team or something ? How far from Earth are we ? Are you from Earth ? Of course I 'm from Earth . Where are you from ? Well , I 'm sorry , I 've never ... My father 's there . I think . Hold it . You 've never been to Earth ? No , I 'm ... - Wait a minute . - What ? You an alien ? No , do I look like one ? Never mind . Here , hold this . - What are we doing ? - Shh ! I got a job to do . What happened ? Oh no . Where 's Ethan ? Ethan ! Ethan ! Not so fast . Would you give me a break ? What do these things look like ? - What do they look like ? - Yeah . You ever see a piranha ? It 's a fish , right ? That 's right . They look nothing like a piranha . But they 're hungry like a piranha . Whoa ! Now watch these ducts . They love ducts . Ahh ! " Dr. McCormick . " You know ... I don 't even know your name . Um ... Charlie . I 'm Ethan . Nice to meet you . What do you think of the coat here ? You ... Charlie ? - Hey , look at this . - Shh . They 're close . Where are we ? Yeah . We used to collect specimens like these . Where ? Oh ... Hello ? Fran ? You are engaging in unauthorized communication . This is a restricted access facility . Who is that ? Somebody I 'm starting to hate . A lot . You know , Char ... Char ... Charlie ? Charlie , where are you ? Charlie ? Charlie , where ... - Hey ! - Oh ! I could use some help up here . - In there ? - Yeah . No way . I 'm not going in there . Well , suit yourself . Shit ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ? Charlie , where are you ? What ? What ? Ahh ! No , Charlie . It 's okay . It 's dead . Attention , refuse tube A442 is now filled to capacity and ready for jettison sequence . Jettison sequence ? What 's that ? - Charlie , Charlie ... - Relax . I think this this is getting ready to throw us out into space . - Just relax . - Angela ! Angela , don 't complete the jettison cycle . I 'm not sequenced to respond to the requests or demands of waste material . - We 're not waste material ! - If you are not waste material , you would not be inside the refuse tube . Jettison sequence will begin in 20 seconds . Help ! Help ! Wait , wait . Look . Okay , I see it . - Lift me up . - Get on my shoulders . Up you go . Get it open . Get it open . 15 seconds to full jettison . Hurry up . Go ! - I can 't get it , Charlie . - Yes you can , go ! - Go ! Hurry ! - It won 't open . Jettison in 10 Seconds . Nine seconds . - Eight seconds . - Wait a second . - Seven seconds . - Angela ! Angela , jettison us now . That 's an order . Do it now . I don 't think that 's a good idea . I am not sequenced to respond to the demands of waste material . Good idea . All right . - No ! - Go ! Full jettison in 10 seconds . Nine seconds . Got it . I got it . - Go . - Seven seconds . Six seconds . - Five seconds . - Come on . - Four seconds . - Charlie , grab my hand . Three seconds . Two ... What was it , Rick ? Where 'd you hide it ? You were trouble then and you 're trouble now . Bernie ! Let me out of here ! Come on . - Ethan ? - Yeah , open the grate . Come on , man , open it . What the hell are you doing in there , you idiot ? Just open the grate . Who the hell are you ? I didn 't kill anybody . - Bullshit . - Bernie ! Cool it . All right , Charlie . How did you get into the pod ? When I put the eggs in . Then I passed out . I woke up here . Here , Charlie . Is this from Earth ? Yeah , it 's a driver 's license . See , Grover 's Bend . Were else would it be from ? But , um ... Charlie , it says you expired . No . It 's next year . No , Charlie . This is like 53 years ago . No , that 's 1993 . That 's next year . Charlie , you 've been floating around in that pod for over half a century . Charlie , we 're nowhere near Earth . Nowhere ... No . 53 ... Well , uh ... that means ... everybody I know is ... They 're dead . They 're toast . They 're history . Oh . Okay . Just ... Yeah , well ... I can live with that . He 's telling the truth , Bernie . Sure . Eggs from Earth ? Killer furballs ? Ethan , it is a little hard to believe . Good morning , Dr. McCormick . It 's good to hear from you again . Al Bert , I found this in the lab I told you about . You know , before we got garbaged . Let me see that . Move over . Log retrieval confirmed . A number of experiments have been concluded since last week . Of the hybrids , the most successful so far has been the syphalloids . It is proved the most resistant in nearly every test scenario and has a very high aggression factor . Our forced maturity tests with the metabolic accelerator have proven most successful . What is that ? However , so far we have not been able to make it self-reproducing . Projections demonstrate that a planetary drop of 1,000 syphalloids could efficiently eliminate all other lifeforms ... Holy and clear a target property in as little as two months , if we can develop the means to make them replicate . Therefore , as all the other artificials tend to deconstruct after a few days , I recommend the continuation of funding in order to locate a naturally existing self-replicating predator species until , and unless the syphalloids prove more viable . End of log report dated 3-11-43 . I don 't know what this place is , but I don 't think we should be here anymore . Goddamn corporate sleazebags . - I don 't believe this . - Al Bert . They will be here in a couple more hours . - Take it easy . - So what ? I vote we get the fuck out of here now . No , wait a minute . Where 's Bernie ? God , let it work . We got all of the flavors . Is that him ? - Bernie ? - Shit ! Oh , man . What ! ? You know ... those man-eating hairballs that you do not believe in ? Yeah , what about them ? I am reading two lifeforms on your level - that could be them . - Where ? I don 't know . but I do know that they are real close . And Bernie , I think that you should get up here , and I do mean now . All right . In a minute , in a minute . Bernie , do you copy ? Get back up here double quick . Bernie , do you copy ? Bernie ? Bernie ! ? - It 's them . - Bernie , damn it ! What 's happening ? Hold it . Hold it , wait a second . - Come on . Quick . - Hold it ! Now , they 'll come at your face ... and at your throat . Keep this up in front of you . Come on . Attention , Chief Engineer Davis , please report to central evaluation . I am m-m-monitoring ... Oh shit . Chief Davis to central evaluation . Bernie ? See if he 's still breathing . Look . They 're still wet . Charlie ? That 's not normal . No shit , Sherlock . No , I mean they don 't usually turn from a fight . Or a meal . I 'm leaving . You folks want to stay that 's fine with me . But I am definitely out of here and let Terracor pick up their own pieces . Attention , code seven . Chief Engineer Davis to central evaluation . All personnel , please return to your duty stations . - Whoa , hold it . - No , that way . No , I think it 's this way . Levels five through 11 are being sealed due to a code nine emergency . I thought you said there was no radiation danger . Well , Fran , maybe the nuclear core just changed its mind . Hey ... For your safety and comfort , please return to your stations . There is a radiation hazard on decks six through nine . Please return to your duty stations . For your safety and comfort , please return to your stations . - Go ! - This is a code nine . Please return to your stations . Okay , come on . - Go . - Go . - Go . - Get your ass down there ! - What are these ? - Those are eggs . They 've been busy . Fran , come on . We got to get out of here now . Cut it out , Fran . Hey , they take six months to incubate . Fran ! Let 's get out of here . Charlie ! Come on . Please return to your stations . This is not a drill . Levels five through 11 are now sealed . We 're here . - What ? - We 're here . Al Bert , we just can 'tjump . We got to unlock . Ethan , engineering . - Fran ... - I got it . - Charlie ! - Yeah . Okay , with me . This ... is a genuine antique Colt.45. Used to be the most powerful handgun on Earth . Charlie , it 's all we 've got . We 're a salvage operation . Do you actually know how to shoot one of these things ? Well ... I 'm a.38 Special man myself . You do have bullets for it ? I 've always wondered if one of these things would actually fire . I 'm used to getting a dud now and again . - Move . - This tin can 's gonna move like it 's never done before . - Watch out , Charlie . - Main thrusters in line . 25 mark . 25 is set . Nav-con is on hold . - Get it yet , Fran ? - Nearly ready . Did you do that ? Of course not . I 'm fast , but not that fast . - Ethan ! - Yeah , what ? - Did you ... - What ? Never mind . No ! Please , Charlie . Charlie ! Please tell me he is not shooting a gun in here . I got him . I got him good . I got him . Hey , I got him ! Oh , got him good ! Aww . No . Congratulations , Charlie , you have just murdered the ship . But I got him . Can 't we just , you know , go to the next dock over ? Get another ship ? No , this is our ship . It 's the only ship , you idiot ! Holy shit . O-okay . I can live with that . But I got him . But I see what you 're saying about it being the only ship . 'Kay . Rick and Bernie are dead . For all I know we may have been infected by some alien goddamn germ . So unless anyone else has another suggestion , I propose that we just hole up here and wait for them to come rescue us . They will be here any minute . Yeah . If we don 't blow up first . Thanks , Charlie . So much for Earth . Nope , there . The one with the wires . Okay . No . Come on , Charlie . God damn it . This thing is fried . It 's gone . Where the hell does he think he 's going ? What are you doing ? You get your ass back here ! Hey ! I 've got something to take care of . We need you back in here . Look , there 's one left . I 'm going to go take care of it . - Leave it be ! - You 're not my father ! Al Bert . - What , what , what ? - Company . All right ! Come on , Charlie , let 's go , let 's go . Docking completed . Welcome Terracor ship to Terracor Station 44 . - You may call me Angela . - Hey , hold it , hold it . Please complete decontamination procedures before disembarking . You are the crew of the RSS Tesla ? Yeah . What 's left of it . Ug ? - Is that you ? - No further . Ug ... it 's me , it 's Charlie . Who is this guy ? He 's my friend . I mean , he was my friend . He is . Where are the eggs ? Look here , I don 't know who you think you are or what your game is ... Hey ! What the hell do you think you 're doing coming in here with your goddamn stormtroopers ? ! Get the guns out of my face . You do not pull that stuff on us , get it ? ! What 's your problem ? You overstep your bounds . Where are the Crite specimens ? Ug , what ... ? Don 't ! Don 't tell him anything , Charlie . It 's not worth it . Someone must cooperate . You will die next . Screw ... you . You three start on this level , then search deck eight . Report to me when you 've found the eggs . I guess you got a promotion , huh ? Things change , Charlie . Things change . Recon formation , guys . Stay hot . Angela , do not , repeat , do not close and secure door number 16 on level four . Yes ! Pulsars on nine . Stay close . This way . Angela , do not close door number 21 on level four . Angela , emergency drill . Do not comply . We 're being handled , sir . I know , the computer 's doing it . Angela , emergency drill . Do not close and secure door number 26 on level four . Deck four , sir . We 're at the lab . We had a reading here . 47 , guys . Oh ! They 're blast doors , sir ! Okay , close up . Look sharp . Yes ! Get him ... aaah ! Get him , get him ! Where are they ? ! Attention . The nuclear core has become unstable . There is a danger of critical mass in 10 ... 10 minutes . Huh ? Commencing countdown . Please evacuate all ... You hear that ? We 're gonna die in 10 minutes ! Ug , listen to me . You 're being pigheaded . The Critters are probably all the way to Earth by now . Ug ? Then your time has run out . - Oh wow . - Hey , did I hear you wanted these ? Oh God . Well , keep your eyes on ' em . These are the last ones , see ? Your guards , they uh ... they kinda screwed up . Ohhh . Don 't worry , I 'm real good at this . Sometimes ... I just ... I can 't quite seem to ... get it right . - Oww . - Are you okay ? Yeah . Come on , let 's get out of here . Wait a minute , can you fly this ship ? It 's probably 90 % automated . - Does that mean yes ? - It means , Ethan , in that ship we can probably make it to Earth in two months or less . Right . Come on , Charlie . Let 's go . I 'll be right there ! Ethan , come on , let 's get out of here ! Oh God . Chill out ... asshole . You 're not going anywhere . That 's a nice antique , Charlie . Does it work ? You bet . Now let him go , Ug . You can 't do it , Charlie . You never could . Things change , Ug . Things change . So do people . Attention , attention . Hear this ... the nuclear core will cause the station to vaporize in three and a half minutes . - Can we get out of here now ? - Let 's go ! For your listening pleasure , I have selected a music track with a running time of three minutes . Hustle , guys . Come on ! Oh man . - How the hell does this thing work ? - Here , Charlie . - Strap in . - ' Kay . I hope ... Oh whoa . 10 seconds to detonation . Have a good day . - Nine seconds . Eight ... - Angela , you are the stupidest machine ever built . Thank you , but I am not able to accept compliments from waste material . Five seconds . Four ... Ha ! Figures . She couldn 't tell time either . You okay ? Hell no . We 're on autopilot ... which is how I like to be . On course for Earth , guys . Better check this baby out . Can I help ? Yeah . - Charlie ... - Yeah ? ... now don 't you touch anything . - No . Captain Charles McFadden . Whoa !

 He 's wearing her gym shorts on his head . He 's strutting around the classroom . [ Drilling ] What are you doing ? This is my bathroom too . Gosh , I 'm sorry . I guess I never learned how to share . - Where am I supposed to go ? - Well , you have a number of choice : the woods , kitty box ... your pants . [ Laughing ] Chett 's been pulling this crap my whole life . - I shouldn 't take this . - You don 't have to . I 'll take this wall ... knock it down ! - I 'm serious . - I-I 'm serious . - We should . - I will . - Just knock it down . - Bang ! - One kick . - It 's down . - Stupid wall ! - Stupid Chett ! [ Grunts ] Oh , no . - Look what I did ! - What 'd you do that for ? I don 't know . My foot . And then you said ... and then I ... - We 're dead . - You got that right , cheese bag . [ Groans ] Hey ! He can 't reach us . Moron ! Bet you wish you had a door now . [ Laughing ] The door ! CHETT : Whoa . Big heavy door . I 'll huff and I 'll puff ... and I 'll rip your freakin heads off ! [ Drilling ] BOTH : Lisa ! - Chett doing a little remodeling ? - Chett will kill us ! - Do something ! - Zap him back to before he was mad at us . Okay . Check it out . Zap ball , corner pocket . [ Bullet Ricocheting ] [ Explosion ] Chett ? WYATT : W-what did you do ? You told me to put him back to before he was mad . At me ! Before he was mad at me . Like ten minutes ago . Hey , I 'm a genie , not a mind-reader . Shh . Shh . Shh . It 's okay ... Chett . - He smells weird . - Maybe he needs to be changed . Okay . Into what ? You don 't know much about babies , do you ? Lisa , my folks will be back in three days . How long is he going to be like this ? Hard to say . Could be months , years ... A weekend ? It 's hard to believe this cute little fellow 's the same guy who used my tongue to spread turtle wax on his jeep . Hey , wait a minute . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? Nah . His tongue 's way too small . No . We can re-raise him . Chett 's this way because of how he was raised . If we raise him ourselves we can create a kinder , gentler Chett . - He keeps saying " we . " - I noticed that . Come on . What do you say ? Well , let 's see . How to spend my weekend ? Monster truck rally ? Or potty training Chett ? - Toodles . - Oh , please , Gary . This is my one chance to create the brother I never had . To undo everything my parents did wrong . Okay . But I 'm not touching doody . - Lisa ? - I don 't know . I 'd give me the willies . You 're pretty . I love you . Oh ... Just a little something from your Aunt Lisa . It says , " Kids are shaped by their environment . " So if we want a peaceful , love Chett we can 't expose him to anything scary or violent . No news , no horror flicks ... no barney video . Here comes the choo-choo headed for the tunnel . [ Making Crash Noises ] Oh , no ! Derailed ! Oh , look . Toxic waste . Ah ! Ah ! I 'm melting ! Ahh ! That 's not funny . He 's going to lose his trust in us . Chett ... Gary didn 't mean it . Everyone on the choo-choo lived happily ever after . - Now , say you love him . - Forget it . - Do it . - No way . It 's Chett . Why should I be nice to him ? You have to constantly reinforce that he 's in a safe and loving environment . I love you . They grow like weeds , don 't they ? - Can I go play ? - All right . But stay where I can keep an eye on you . Okay , what do we have to cover ? Let 's see . " Outdoor activity skill ... " group interaction , sharing nature appreciation ... " " A gallon of double fudge rocky road " ? That 's for me . Bang ! Bang ! You 're dead , sucker ! Uh-uh . I 'm invisible . You missed me . Never , never , never play with guns ... or kids who play with guns ... or kids who watch TV shows about kids who play with guns- - awful , yicky , nasty , stinky , bad , bad guns . Here . Have a pretty flower instead . Bang ! You 're dead ! [ Chett Sighing ] I had so much fun today , Wyatt . Lisa , will you tell me a bedtime story ? Of course I will . How about " Hansel and Gretel " ? Ooh-hoo . - What ? - " Hansel and Gretel " ? Cannibalism ? Abandonment ? - Bad idea . - " Little Red Riding Hood " ? Grandma ends up Wolf Kibble . Let me do this . Okay . Ready for a story ? Once upon a time there were three little pigs - and they were all brothers . - Brothers ? Like us ? Right . Just like us . And these three little pigs built three very nice houses- - One of straw , one of sticks and one of bricks . And one day a wolf went up to the pig 's straw house and he said ... um ... he said , " That 's a nice house you got there , pig . " Let me know if you need any help moving in . " I got a truck . And they all lived happily ever after . Isn 't there supposed to be some huffing - and puffing in there ? - Sure . When they moved the refrigerator . And the moral is- - Everyone even pigs and wolves , be nice . The world is such a lovely place full of beautiful things . Good night , Chett . Good night , sweetie . - Don 't let the bedbugs bite . - CHETT : Bedbugs ? Wyatt ? [ Crying ] Way to go . - LISA : Morning , Gar . - ' Morning . What action-packed nonviolent activity do we have planned for today ? I thought we 'd take Chett to the children 's museum . He way be too big for that . Good morning , everybody . Isn 't it a beautiful day ? Oh , shoot . I wanted to make you breakfast . I think I 'm going to like this . # Something tells me I 'm into something good # I never knew having a brother could be so much fun . Brother er , Wyatt . With a cherry on top . I 'm really glad things are working out , Wy . You 've done a great job . - Yeah . Great . - Chett , how many cards you want ? I don 't know , Gary . I got your aces and a seven . - Sevens are lucky . - Gary ... no hints . - [ Doorbell Rings ] - You two must feel very proud . Rocko ? Chaz ? - Uh , what do you guys want ? - Where 's your bro ? Bravo leader calling alpha leader ! Operation booze n ' flooze is moving out ! Hoo-hoo-hoo ! Wait . He 's not here . I haven 't seen him in days ... Hi , guys . Want to play crazy eights ? What 's with the costume , chester ? You going to church ? Nice clothes make me feel good about myself . Wyatt says you should put creases in your pants not your forehead . We 're wasting valuable time standing here . We could be sitting on our butts drinking beer . - What 's so funny ? - You said " butt " . Come on , let 's roll . Cut it out . You 're tickling me . I 'm going to go play with these guys . - We got to go after him . - We 're underage . [ Hearty Laughter ] - What 's that ? - You got in , didn 't you ? Yeah , but we look like zz top on a job tomorrow . - He 's dead . - And then the piece said to the bartender " No , I 'm a Frayed Knot . " Got it ? Frayed Knot ? You 're one funny guy , Chett . I haven 't heard those jokes since I was ten . Hey , did I tell you I 'm on a seafood diet ? See ... food . See food . I got to remember that one . What do you know ? He 's doing great . It 's all in the parenting . Hey , guys , look , I got another one . Go ahead . Hit my hand . You 're okay , Chett . You make me laugh . Come on , ladies , let 's roll . Ladies ? They 're not ladies . Uh , Rolph ? Aren 't you forgetting something ? # Somebody needs their helmet . # Nobody tells me how to ride my hog . Maybe that 's ' cause nobody ever cared about you - enough to tell you . - So , what are you saying ? I 'm just saying I care about you , Rolph . You seem like a big-hearted lug that was trouble fitting in with the world . Well , I have been kind of a loner all my life . You see ? The Chett we raised can warm even the hardest of hearts . That 's my boy . I love you , Rolph . I love all of you . Now , come on , line up for hugs ! I take it back . He 's idiot . [ Snarling ] Ooh , my spleen ! [ Punches ] Ooh , that hurt ! ROLPH : This is gonna hurt you . CHETT : Why would they ... ? Ow ! Sit still . You 'll rip the stitches . But , but you said the world is a happy place where everybody loves each other like in the poky little puppy . A-and it is . The world is like the poky little puppy . Well , then , why did Rolph shove his finger in my eye ? That was the poky part . Wyatt , conference time . You 've created frankenweenie- - a big-headed freak . He 's just outgrown his crummy old friends . - It 's a sin of maturity . - Ow-ow-ow ! Blow ! Blow ! Blow ! Admit it . He can 't function in the real world . No . He can 't function in his old world . We just have to find him a new life . A place where his sweet nature will be appreciated . CHETT : Here you are , Mrs. Pepperton . Now , remember , flowers need more than water and sunshine . They also need your love so , treat them as you would your children and mist them every day . The flowers , not your kids . Bye-bye , Mrs. Pepperton . Bye-bye , Daisies . You know , Chett , I 've never know a boy take to stems and stamens like you . I swear , you must be part bumblebee . Oh , no , Mr. Kite . I just love these flowers . I could get lost smelling the snapdragons and the bougainvillaea . [ Sighing ] Bumblebee . - Hi , Chett . - Guys ! What are you doing here ? We just wanted to see how your first day - at work was going . - Oh , it 's terrific ! I think Mr. Kite is terrific I think the flowers are terrific ... tell them the one about the bumblebee . Wyatt , I guess I owe you an apology . You were right about Chett . He 's doing okay . WYATT : I thought he 'd be happy here . - Nice environment , good people . - KITE : Almost forgot , Chett . These have to be at the Henderson Brothers by 2 : 00 . Oh . Brothers . That 's nice . Like the pigs . A-and me and Wyatt . I think it 's just what they call their funeral home . Wyatt , what 's a funeral ? So ... Grandma 's going to die ? [ Sobbing ] Eventually , Chett . It 's nature . That 's why we need funerals . And what about puppies ? - Do they die too ? - No , Chett , puppies don 't die . - They grow up into dogs . - And then they live forever ? - No . They die too . - [ Bawling ] Well , Dr. Frankenstein , I hope you 're happy . - All of a sudden this is my fault ? - No , it 's been your fault all along . If he can 't hack it in a flower shop he can 't hack it anywhere . - So , I forgot to teach him about death . - What else did you forget ? Chett , where do babies come from ? They fall out of the baby tree and then you pick them up and dust them off and cuddle them . Very good . If a dog comes up to you with foam dripping out of his mouth what do you do ? Bring him home and name him foamy . - Heard enough ? - I don 't care . I have a kind , caring brother who loves me . - So what if he 's a little ... - Wimpy ? - Freakish ? - Sensitive . He 's loyal , warm and doesn 't administer daily beatings . Do you expect me to give that up . Do you have to go to the bathroom ? - I didn 't want to interrupt . - Go the the bathroom , Chett . - Thank you . - Okay , he 's hopeless . I don 't get it though . Everything my parents did wrong raising Chett we did right . - But you coddled him . - I nurtured him . You screwed him up . You didn 't allow Chett to develop his own natural instincts . - Without them , he can 't survive . - Okay . So ... How do we change him back ? We have to bring his natural instincts to the surface . Natural instincts ? You 're saying the old Chett is somewhere inside that ? Watch . Whoo ! Just made it . - Hey , what 's all that ? - It 's a puzzle , Chett . See if you can put it together . A puzzle ! Keen ! - Unbelievable . - See ? Instinct . Ah ! Done ! But , uh , what is it ? Oh , I know . It 's a flute . You guys have your work way cut out for you . [ Blowing ] I don 't know about this . - There 's got to be a better way . - No . If Chett 's going to develop his natural instincts as a warrior we got to get him into a fight . But this time , we can 't rescue him . He 's got to learn to stand up for himself . Hey , look- - free peanuts ! They 're everywhere ! Chett , get over here . You remember that joke we memorized together ? It 's time to go share that joke with your friends . - I didn 't get it . - You will . Excuse me , Rolph . Oh , if it isn 't the cuddle-bug . You here to lead us in a sing-a-long ? Well ... sure , if you 'd like but first , I 'm supposed to tell you my funny joke . Everybody , Chett here 's going to tell us a funny joke . - Knock-knock . - Who 's there ? You , you piece of [ Bleep ] [ Bleep ] that 's who . [ Yelling ] Wait . Maybe you didn 't get it . I said , you , you piece of [ Bleep ] mother ... Oh ! Wyatt ! We 've got to let it run its course . I can 't ! He 's my brother ! - Who the hell is this ? - That 's my brother . - Hi , Wyatt . - You made your point . You win . We 'll be leaving now . I 'm not finished yet . I got a joke F you . Wyatt , say " who 's there ? " [ Chuckling ] You picked the wrong day to mess with my little brother , skidmark . Oh , yes , he 's back ! That 'll teach you to hang out with the big boys , sis . What are you doing here- - collecting sawdust for your hamster cage ? [ Laughing ] Psych ! Hey , who does a guy got to gut around here to get a cold one ? See , Wyatt , the old Chett is back in action . What have we done ? [ Yelling ] [ Chuckling Softly ] - Hey , Chett . - Pit-lick , pucker-butt . Always a pleasure .

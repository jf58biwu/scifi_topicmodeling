 - the name 's Brogan- - Lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years , I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now- - Well , let 's just say . " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - Come on , Steve . You 've seen the p.I. ' s report on this guy . - Yeah , so ? - Shouldn 't we take his threats seriously ? - We have , John . We have spent serious money on security . - But you know- - - Good night , John . See you in the morning . [ thunder rumbling ] computer ! - Yes , sir . - Security activate . - Outer security perimeter , armed . [ beeping ] inner security perimeter , armed . [ beeping ] - Third level security , armed . - [ beeping ] - Goodnight . - Goodnight , sir . [ clap of thunder ] [ HISSING ] [ SIZZLING ] [ laughing ] - I hope you understand , Mr. Dallas . There is nothing personal about this , but ... business is business . [ timer beeping ] - We have one Stephen Dallas . Human male , age 42 . Ceo of Brett interplanetary . Blown to smithereens . - and we have a message- - Presumably from our bomber . - You know , fredo , that kind of looks like your first wife 's handwriting . - Hey ! - We also have the testimony of John Kane , Dallas ' partner . Seems they were caught in a high stakes shakedown by someone claiming to be " the snake . " - Yeah , and the bad news is that this kind of shakedown does fit with the snake 's known m.O. - He 's an extortionist- - Plain and simple- - Who 's terrorized seven planets . - Seven planets we know of . And in every case , the victims either pay up , or they die . Like Stephen Dallas . - Hi , bill . - Hi . - This is sergeant bill gray , people- - Ecpf . He 's the good news this morning . Gray knows more about the snake than any man alive . He 's here to help us . The 88th is to be temporarily reorganized into a task force . As of 25 : 00 hours , all other cases will be finished , or handed over to the 86th is that clear ? I don 't intend that altor shall become the 8th notch on the snake 's belt . - Just another quiet day in the neighborhood . - Yeah . Now , castle , given your background , I want you to help head up the task force with Brogan . - With all due respect , captain , I 'd rather not . - Take a seat , Mr. Kane . - You never had any contact with the snake , Mr. Kane ? - None . Stephen Dallas got all the messages . - How were you suppose to make the payoff ? - I 'm not sure . Stephen said something about a computer transfer to Danae . - And from there ? - I don 't know and I don 't care ! I mean , what the hell difference does it make ? - Look , Mr. Kane , we understand how you feel . But if we 're gonna nail this guy , we need to know everything you know . - All I know is Stephen 's dead . - and if I don 't pay ... . - You 're right- - You should talk to him . - Who ? - Brogan . - Are you reading my mind ? - Who needs to- - It 's written all over your face . - Honey , you tell zill I really don 't have time- - - But , dad , zill says you really , really need to get home on time tonight ! - Uh , okay . Tell her I 'll do my best . Bye , sweetie . [ zill squeaking ] officer castle , what 's up ? - I thought maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee ? - Sounds good . - the problem 's not me and gray , it 's me and the snake . Three years ago , gray and I were part of an ecpf bomb disposal unit , back on earth . - I 'm impressed . - Well you should be- - We were good . We were all good . First time the snake hit our district , we diffused three of his bombs in one day . We thought we 'd beaten him . - He set you up . - Next time we went in , gray and I were running the operation from a remote . It looked safe- - It seemed right . So we sent in the team . - I 'm sorry . - Yes- - But sorry doesn 't bring any of them back . - Yo , prime elder ! - Hey , Matt- - Where is everybody ? - Mom 's in the garden , I think . - and Liz ? - Short , mega-Weird earthling , about this high ? Always saying , " Zill says this . " Zill says that . " - Yeah , that 's the one . - Look the part , dad . She 's gone- - Vanished . Nah , she 's at Charlotte 's . - So am I. - Whoa , you 're goin to Charlotte 's ? - No way- - Get tweaked ! I 'm going to inazy 's . Later ! - hmm . I smell a conspiracy . - actually it 's a steak . - This took a lot to set up , didn 't it ? - Very sharp , lieutenant . But , somehow , I think it will all be worthwhile . - Yeah , me too . Champagne . - sort of . - Hmmm . - Mmm . [ device ringing ] - I 'll get it . What 's up ? - Plenty- - Take a look . - Greetings , talon corporation- - I am the snake . Now , listen carefully . You will transfer 60 million credits into the planetary bank of Danae by Coded transfer Within 26 hours , or the Princess dies . - Talon corporation . What happen to John Kane and Brett interplanetary ? - Looks like our bomber decided to do some double dipping . - Cute . Why the computer-Generated image ? - Don 't know . But gray thinks it 's the real deal . - Okay . Who 's this Princess . - Not who- - it . It 's an Omega class tanker , and it 's en route to altor , carrying 200 million gallons of liquefied hydrogen . We 're talkin one major bang here . - Yeah . When did talon get this information ? - Six hours ago . - Nice of them to let us know . Okay , I 'm coming in . Uh , Sally . - I know . - now it 's your job to determine if this is for real . If you find anything , I want you to mark and identify , then back off . Are you following me on this , Brogan ? - Yes , sir- - But I think- - - No but 's . The army is the first team on this thing . We 're simply there to make sure it 's not a hoax . - You 're sure about this , gray ? - Would you rather look for the bombs yourself ? - Yeah , but turning an rsa into a bomb-Sniffer . Will it work ? - It 'll work . Nobody knows bombs better than bill gray . - Nobody except , maybe , " No hassle Castle . " Hi , Jane- - Long time no see . - Bill . - " No hassle castle ? " - It 's a long , Boring story . - Come on , Officer castle . What could ever be Boring about you ? - My relationship with you , haldane , for starters . - All right- - All right . Come on , slomo . Let 's go play with somebody nice . Like the snake . - Why send slomo , captain ? He 's not equipped to handle this sort of work . At least call the boys over at the 98th . They got a real bomb disposal robot . - I 'm sure our Slomo would be deeply touched to know that you two are showing such Concern for his well-Being . If he had any emotions to be touched with , or a being for that matter ! He 's a robot ! That 's why we 're sending him as a remote control unit ! Do you get my drift ? - What about castle ? I think we ought to let her sit this one out . - Yeah . Well , watch yourself . - I have a choice ? - Whoa , that is one big mother . - The Princess talon is an inanimate object . It cannot be , um , a " mother . " - Careful , slomo . I just may forget how to reattach your body . - I think you 're wasting your time , lieutenant . The chief and I have already scanned the Princess from stem to Stern . - And found zip ? Whole thing 's starting to smell like a hoax . - Let 's hope you 're right . [ device beeping ] - Brogan , slomo 's got the hots in here . Airlock one . - on our way . - I have detected traces of cemetal around the outer seam of , uh , this junction box . - Yeah- - That 's the snake 's explosive of choice . - It 's also used in plasma welding , lieutenant . - She 's less than two months out of dry dock . This whole section 's been refitted . - can you call up the schematics ? - Strange . - What ? - According to this ... that junction box doesn 't exist . - What- - engineering oversight ? - Wouldn 't be the first time . - All right- - Let 's see what we got here . They got two conduits . - Leading ... - Nowhere . - Everybody backup . - Congratulations . You 've just armed four explosive devices . Each which is linked to the outer doors . No one leaves- - No one enters . Any attempt to disarm the devices will result in the obvious . I repeat . All four bombs are now armed . You have 13 hours to pay , or die . - This guy 's really starting to tick me off . - Brogan , we got another one in airlock two . - Ditto for lock three . - Copy that for four . - All four bombs present and accounted for . - And as near as we can tell , they 're all identical . - is there any way that you guys can get out of there ? Let the army take over ? - Negative . The bombs are linked to the outer doors of every air lock . The only way we 're gonna get off this ship is by diffusing the bombs . We are first team now . Have we heard from our bomber ? - Uh , neg-Negative . - You have to tell them , captain . - I 'm well aware of that , sergeant . - Wa-Wait a minute- - Tell us what ? What 's goin ' on ? - Talon 's call for a headquarters in their ... how shall I say it ? Infinite wisdom , have decided that- - Oh , damn it ! What the hell have I done with that communique ? - Damn it and hell in the same sentence . Not a good sign . - Ah , here it is . " for the past decade , the snake has nearly " Bled our corporation dry . " therefore , it is with deep regret " that we have decided that we must make a stand . " the talon corporation refuses to entertain " Any ideas of acquiescing in his continuing demands " Of extortion or blackmail . " - They can 't do that . - I 'm afraid they can . It 's their constitutional right . - Constitutional right ? ! what about our right to live ? - Captain ? Where will the Princess be 12 hours from now ? - We 're on course for our scheduled stationary orbit over demeter . - Yeah , well if it blows there . Can we alter the course ? - It 'll take a little time , but I think we can probably avoid being pulled into altorian orbit . - why don 't we just hit the brakes ? - We 've been in full reverse thrust for 13 days . - It takes two weeks for a ship of this mass to slow out of light speed . - Brogan , the clock 's ticking . Set up slomo on a remote and I 'll talk him through the first device . - we can 't play this one bomb at a time , gray . We 'll each take a device . Slomo goes first , then me , then haldane , then captain tecopa . We watch slomo , then follow its sequence . - Yeah , it makes sense . - And if slomo makes a wrong move ? - The Princess is tripled hulled . We can probably lose an air lock , even two , and still maintain Hull integrity . - Let 's do it . - Sergeant fredo ? - Okay , can we res up the definition ? How 's that ? - Like I was there . - Uh , be careful , slomo . - I am a robot- - I can only be the way I am . But your concern has been logged . - You 're welcome . [ alarm sounding ] - All set here . - Let 's go , then . - hold it . I 'm running the remote . - You always were the best in the business . - Right , castle . - No electronic devices scanned . Nor are mechanical devices scanned . - Okay , the front panel 's clean . Reconfigure , slomo . Then , back the first screw out . - The first screw has been removed . - Take out the second screw . - The , uh , second screw has been removed . - All right , Brogan- - You 're next . So far , so good . Let 's open it up- - Carefully . - Classic snake architecture . - seems to be- - Yes . - You can disarm it ? - We need to figure out what 's live , and what 's window dressing . - and what could blow them away . - Come on . - We have two choices . Either we find the primary trigger and disarm it , which is quite risky . - All right- - All right . Come on , Janey- - cut to the Chase . - Or we find the main power source and pull the plug . Slomo ? The rectangular device at the lower left corner . Reconfigure and identify . - Uh , a visual scan indicates a stabilizer . No detected current flow . - Window dressing ? - Maybe . Slomo , reconfigure . Can you remove it ? - Affirmative . - Bingo- - The power pack . - You-You just unplug it ? - We try . Slomo ? Reconfigure . Disconnect the power pack . [ all breathing sighs of relief ] - Uh-Oh . - Talon Princess- - Come in ! Princess ! Please respond ! [ Alarm sounding ] - Ahhh ! - Chief , how we doin ' ? - Communications are down , but backup 's working . - How 's the air ? - It 's okay for now . - Brogan- - Haldane ? - Yeah- - Haldane . But as you can see visual 's a no-go . - Brogan- - Thank god ! What 's your status ? - Uh , we lost our main antennae and half our air . Uh , primary 's are down , but backup 's still working . At least for now . - Well , that 's the good news , I suppose . - What about slomo ? - Uh , we lost him . - and haldane ? - Yeah , I thought you 'd never ask . - Just curious . - Gotta go ! - If anyone has an idea , I 'd love to hear it . - Yes , call talon corporation and tell them I 'm coming down there to get the snake his 60 million credits . - humph ! If I thought it do any good , I 'd drive the getaway Hopper myself , but- - - Well that 's great , captain . We can put that on their grave stones . Sorry . But I 've been down this road before . - There were two of us running that op , castle . So let 's lose the self pity . Or at least spread it around . Deal ? - Deal . - Captain- - John Kane on comm two . The snake just sent Brett interplanetary another one of his love letters . - put him on . Mr. Kane ? - I can 't take anymore of this , captain ! I don 't want to die . If the snake got to Stephen Dallas , he sure as hell can get to me . I 've decided to pay . - Hmmm . [ sizzling ] - You shouldn 't have refused to pay . You made a very s-s-Stupid mistake , John Kane . - and I suppose your mistake makes you a genius . - Go ahead ... pull the trigger , cop . You know what 'll happen . Ha ! [ Snake hissing ] - One snake ... to go . - if I didn 't know the sleazebag was cooling his heels in interrogation , I wouldn 't believe it meself . - Has he started talkin ' yet ? - No , but he will . - Yeah , well it better be soon , 'cause times a wastin ' . - He 'll talk . I 'll make damn sure of that , I promise you . - Woo ! If ever there was a time to celebrate . Oh , sorry . - What is this stuff ? - Banko Brandy- - Best there is . - Well , I 'd hate to taste the worst . What 's going on , guys ? - She shut down . - Check the conducers- - I 'll get the I.O. ' s ! [ Hissing ] - Who 's working on it now ? - Gray 's in there , then it 's my turn . [ shoots firing ] - John ! - Code red ! Prisoner on the loose on level five ! Code red ! - No ! - His blood ... it 's burning through the deck plates . - Come on ! - Great simtor ! - Stay there , bill . He 's going through the Hull ! Let 's get out- - quick ! Out- - out ! - Evacuate the area ! Seal off this corridor now ! Close the door- - Quick ! - So much for the snake . - So much for finding a way to disarm those bombs . - Get these people outta here- - This is a restricted area ! Come on , you- - Clear this area ! - So , we have three hours to disarm the devices ? - Uh , not anymore , we don 't . When airlock one went , the debris did more damage than we thought . We 've lost the engine . - And our brakes . - So what 's the bottom line ? - We 're on a collision course with altor . If we hit atmosphere with This payload ... - a lot of people are gonna have bad hair days . - What did you guys have in mind ? - On my mark we got 40 minutes . We take one more shot at disarming the BOMBS , then , at 10 O 'clock , whether or not we 're still on board ... have the military blow the Princess out of the sky . Mark . - Our long range lasers are in position . They 'll fire automatically . I sure as hell hope you can get your men off the Princess in time , captain . - Thank you , commander ! - What 's that , zill ? - [ zill squeaking ] you want Liz to clean up my room right now ? And all the closets ? - That 's not what he said , Matt . Zill says- - - You 're a zigga warthead . - Mom , he 's calling me names again ! - All right- - Come on , guys . - I 've had it . - it wasn 't me- - Zill started it . Do your homework , now . [ device ringing ] - Uh , yes- - Who is it ? - Uh , it 's me , Sal . - Hi ! I can 't get a picture . - Yeah , it 's a technical snafu- - No biggie . - You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Um , look I don 't have a whole lot of time and , um ... I just wanted to tell ya- - - Is this about last night ? - Uh , sort of . Yeah , I mean , um , I 'm sorry- - - Yeah , well , I could 've married a plumber instead . - What I meant was- - - Brogan , I was joking . What 's wrong ? - I need to tell you ... - Daddy , zill has something to say to you . - Not now , honey , okay ? - A deceiver unmasked is still a deceiver . Isn 't that neat ? A deceiver unmasked is still a deceiver . What 's it mean ? - Brogan , we 're ready here . - Yeah , all right . Um , honey I 've got to go . Uh , I 'll , uh ... I 'll try and get back to you . I love you . Airlock two in position . - Airlock three all set . - Airlock four , ready . - Brogan ? Tell me everything you see . - Okay , the flashing , uh , cube in the lower left-Hand corner . Two circuit boards , top left and right . And , let 's see ... Wait a minute . There 's somethin ' here that looks like a mirror under the left-Hand circuit board . - a mirror- - of course . A laser trap . We need to pinpoint the lasers . Anything handy to dust with ? - Yeah , a fire extinguisher . - try it . But point it away from the device . The temperature change could blow the bomb . - Got ' em ! - Well , whatever you do don 't break the beams . That was slomo 's mistake . - Any good news ? - Maybe . You said there Were two circuit boards ? - Yeah- - Top left and right . - too many . - You think one of them 's a dummy ? - and it may be camouflage for the main trigger . We find that trigger , figure out how to disarm it and we could be home free . - I 'm sold- - Just tell me what to do . - Scan the panel on the left for energy readings . - Uh , 6.6 . - Now , the one on the right ? - Nothin ' . - We got our dummy . Now remove it . Very carefully . - ah ! Oh , if that ain 't a main trigger I 'm a trazen 's uncle . - Come on , Brogan . Leave your family tree out of this . - Tell me what you see . - Uh , somethin that looks like a brass tube . - that 's the trigger module . There should be two plasma cores at the base . - right . - and they 're both fused into separate splitter units . - Fused ? - Micro-Welded . - Negative . These puppies are online and connected with Screwed down wire connectors . - Say again ? - They 're connected with wire connectors . - But that 's impossible . Unless ... - Jane , what 's wrong ? - Wait one . We 're up against it and I need some help . - Sure- - Fire away . - Do you mind giving us a minute ? - Sure . - The snake has always connected his bomb Components using his own blood to micro-Weld . - right . - for some reason , he 's used regular connectors on this job . I wonder why . - We all change . - I guess we do . Because I 've never heard of the snake shaking down two different victims at the same time , either . - hmm . Well , maybe he was getting greedy in his old age . - Or maybe the snake never sent those messages to talon , after all . Maybe somebody who had access to the files ran a computer construct and generated their own snake . - I , uh ... I hate to admit it , Janey , but I really don 't know what you 're talking about . - I 'm talking about the fact that nobody can figure out how the snake smuggled a gun into the station . As a matter of fact , no one even saw him with a gun . Except you . Forensics will have a field day with this . - You always were my best student , Janey . - You walked into interrogation , shot yourself with your own weapon . And then you drove the snake into the corridor , where you blew him away . Why , bill ? - Well , I 'd love to give you a pathetic story about a cop 's pay and so on , but ... the fact is , after 25 years of loyal service , I figured I deserved it . - You did this for money ? - Nobody 's perfect . - Gray- - That 's one for the books . - He 's right here and he 's going to help you . Aren 't you , bill ? - All right , gray . We 've identified the dummy panel , removed it and exposed the trigger module . We also found the laser trap by the power pack . So which one is it ? The trigger , or the power pack ! Which one ? - Bill ? - Short out the power pack and disconnect it . - Tookie , can you tell if he 's lying ? - He 's as tightly controlled as any human I 've ever tried to read . I can 't be sure . - Haldane ? Tecopa ? Stand by . - a deceiver unmasked ... is still a deceiver . - Brogan , what are you doing ? You 've got less than three minutes before the military blow the Princess into hyperspace ! - Do it , Brogan- - Do it ! - Ha ! It 's the trigger guys ! Yank the trigger ! - Ha , ha . - No hassle castle wins . - I love this job . - Brogan , we got 30 seconds ! Let 's get the hell out of here before the military blows this mother . Come on- - Come on ! - Brogan ? Haldane ? - You rang ? - Oh , guys ! - Just one question , lieutenant ? How did you figure out ? - Uh , you got me , captain . Haven 't got a clue . - a space tech found him . Somewhere between Danae and the necrosis nebulae . - slomo ! - Oh , ow ! Officer orrin ! Officer romak ! Give me two ! - All right ! - Yes ! - Hey . I just wanted to say , thanks . - Pleasure . - Speaking of pleasure . What do you say about dinner- - Tomorrow night ? The royal striker- - on me . - Pretty high-Class place on a cop 's pay , haldane ? - Yeah . Yeah , on second thought , you 're probably right . - Oh , no . You 're not getting out of it that easy . - Gotcha . - It all boiled down to D.C.P.D. Lieutenant Brogan . None of us would be here , if it hadn 't been for lieutenant Brogan and his team . - You don 't want to hear any more of the news ? - I 've already heard it . - Um , you realize that there are millions of people watchin ' us right now ? - Oh , are they gonna get an eye-Full tonight . - Oh . Mmm . Mmm .

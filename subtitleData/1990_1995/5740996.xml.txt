 Nothing to be done , except escape . Infinisynth . More fantastic than fantasy . More real than reality . The ultimate experience is Infinisynth . It 's all been remade for you . And it 's anything you want it to be . It 's your reality . Let your dreams come true in your very own world . Hook in to the happiness system . Relax , imagine , enjoy . Hook in . Bullshit . ( GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) ( BEEPING ) SYSOP : ( ECHOING ) Judy , you don 't know how much of a fool you 're being . You don 't even know what you 're fighting against . Leave me alone . Injustice ? Everyone gets exactly what they want . Authority . You can be your own God . Everything is ... Everything is fake ! You 're all just lying to yourselves . What will it take to make you understand ? Just leave me alone ! ( BEEPING ) ( MACHINE CHIMING ) ROBOVAC : Proximity . Excuse me . ROBOVAC : Excuse ... ( WHIRRING ) ( ELECTRONIC BUZZING ) Functioning : Online . ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) Proximity . ( BEEPING ) ( MACHINE CHIMING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) ( FLUSHING ) Mom ? Oh , Jenny , you 're up . Judy , Mom . Judy 's my name . You named me that , remember ? Of course , dear . That 's what I said . Are you hungry ? No . You 're not feeling sick or anything , are you ? Of course not . Good . Mom , I want to talk to you . What are you doing off-line ? Why aren 't you hooked in ? I was hooked in . But it doesn 't work anymore . I just get hassled by the Sysop . The Systems Operator , he won 't leave me alone . So , I was sitting , just sitting , listening to Dad 's music . And I don 't know , I just wanted to talk to someone . Talk ? ( SCOFFS ) Come on , now , dear . This isn 't your card . It 's Dad 's ! My father , your husband ? Where did you get it ? I 've had it for years . I felt ... Weren 't we supposed to turn it in or throw it out or something ? ( ANGRILY ) No ! ( SIGHS ) Well ... Mom , what happened to him ? Oh , well , you know , dear , that was so long ago . I don 't see why you should dwell on it . Mom , tell me what happened . I want to know . There 's nothing to tell . I unplugged , and he was just gone . He must have done it himself . They never told me exactly what he did . Did you ask ? Well ... He wasn 't happy anyway , I knew that . Such a sour man , really , now that I think about it . I 'm not happy , either . Just hook back in . You 'll be fine . No ! I want to do something . I want to go somewhere . You can do whatever you want . Go wherever you want . I mean here . Here ? There 's nothing here . That 's why we have Infinisynth , honey . Well ... I 'm awake , Mom . ( EXCLAIMS IN ANGER ) I want to stay awake ! ( MOTHER SINGING OPERA IN ITALIAN ) ( BEEPING ) Wake up . Please . ( MONITOR BEEPS ) ( PANTING ) ( ITALIAN OPERA CONTINUES ) ( AUDIENCE CHEERING ) JUDY : Stop it ! Can 't you just stop it ? Wake up ! Mom . Mother . Please wake up . I need to talk to you . ( SIGHING ) Mom ... I 'll wake you up . ( AUDIENCE CHEERING ) ( AUDIENCE JEERING ) ( BEEPING ) ( JEERING CONTINUES ) Time to wake up , Mom . Wake up ! ( GASPS ) ( AUDIENCE CHEERING ) SYSOP : ( ECHOING ) Judy , that 's enough . You 're an exceptional girl , Judy . You 've managed to violate the system . You 've entered the environments of other users . No one has ever done that before . And I can 't allow it to happen again . You must realize that your actions have dire consequences . What do you want from me ? I don 't want anything . I 'm the Systems Operator . The question is , what do you want ? I was only trying to get through to someone . We gave you everything . Everything you could want . Everything you could imagine . I ... I want something real . Anything . Ah ! We 're ... We 're stuck inside our own heads . It 's worse than a prison . It 's nothing . Nothing at all . Am I the only one that can see that ? There has to be more . More than you can imagine ? Yes . All I want is ... Is something real . All right . I 'll give it to you . I 'm taking you offline . What are you talking about ? It 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? The unimaginable . ( BEEPING ) ( MACHINE CHIMING ) Oh , God . ( ALARM BLARING ) I didn 't mean to really kill her ! ( SCREAMS ) No ! Let me go ! Stop it ! Stop ! Let me out of here ! Stop it , you 're hurting me ! Who are you ? Why are you doing this ? Let me go ! Stop ! ( JUDY SHOUTING ) ( GASPS ) ( GASPS ) ( PANTING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( WIND HOWLING ) What is this place ? ( GASPING ) Hey ! Hello ! ( GRUNTING ) JUDY : Hello ! Is anybody there ? Hello ! God , no ! Somebody , somebody help me ! Somebody help me ! ( CRAWLER MOBILE APPROACHING ) JUDY : ( SCREAMING ) Help me ! Please ! Please ! No ! ( CRYING ) Help me ! Thank you . Oh , thank you . ( SCREAMING ) Let me go ! ( JUDY GRUNTING ) Stop it ! You 're hurting me ! Stop it ! Oh ! Let me go ! ( YELLING ) ( ENGINE STARTING ) ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( COUGHING ) ( EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST ) Get that away from me , you son of a bitch ! ( GROWLING ) Let me go ! ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( SOBBING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( COUGHING ) ( GROWLING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( CRAWLER GROWLING ) ( GROANING ) No ! Don 't ! If you don 't cover up , you 'll die . It 's all right . It 's possum . I don 't eat human flesh . Who are you ? My name 's Stover . I 'm Judy . What the hell is happening ? You were out by the edge of the Deadlands . Crawlers got you . Crawlers ? Cannibals ? It 's the ugly fucks that live underground in the landfills . It 's just a wash . It 's for the chemicals in the ground . Thank you . Close your eyes . You 're an InWorlder . A what ? You 're one of them . You don 't belong here . I know . Well , how the hell did you get here ? I don 't know . I 'd go back if I could . Do you know the way ? Ain 't no maps to heaven . Well , there 's gotta be a way . Well , I figure it 's out someplace past the Deadlands . But there 's no way through there . Why not ? The sickness hits you . Brain sickness . You just want to die . You 've seen others like me , haven 't you ? Yep . But they 're usually dead . Is it always this cold ? No . In the winter , it 's worse . I had no idea what was outside . I didn 't even think there was an outside . That 's because you 've forgotten . You 've all forgotten , haven 't you ? You poisoned the world , you stripped a layer off the sky , and when the ice came , you just left . You left us here to die ! You left us in your shit ! And now , you don 't even remember . I never knew ! The system never told us anything about it ! Well , my people never forgot . Your people ? My ancestors . Now , maybe there wasn 't room enough for them in InWorld . But we never went under . Where are your people now ? Gone . Dead . You 'll need these . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( SIGHS ) ( FIREWOOD CRACKLING ) ( GRUNTS ) STOVER : Now , what you 're looking for is a pattern in the sand . You see over here ? That 's okay . But over here , you see how smooth the surface is ? There we go . That 's great . Crawler hole . Why do the Crawlers do that ? ( SIGHS ) They don 't . I put her up there . She froze to death . That 's my wife . Oh , I 'm sorry . Of course , I 'd prefer to bury the dead , but the ground isn 't safe . The Crawlers , they , uh ... They find the meat . My father 's over there . They got my mother . They took her under . What about that one over there ? Oh , that ? That 's an InWorlder I found years ago . Another exile . Do you remember what he looked like ? Couldn 't tell . Not even an InWorlder deserves to become their food . Family ? My family 's dead . Just give me that . JUDY : With Infinisynth , you live your life in a room , plugged into the system . You 're awake long enough to eat and use the toilet , and that 's it . That 's all there is . But there 's no pain , no danger . If reality 's all in your mind , isn 't that enough ? Not for me . It can be beautiful here . It 's safe now . The sun 's low , filtered through more atmosphere . Any other time ... ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR OPENING ) I 've never seen a real book before . This is the Bible . I 've heard of it . But who needs Bibles in heaven ? Then what do you believe in ? Have you no hope for eternity ? If you want eternity , Infinisynth can give it to you . It 's just a sensation . If you want to shake the hand of God , you do it . It 's a program . What about you ? What did you do in the machine ? I explored other planets . I tried being a planet . I rode on dinosaurs . I ate at nice restaurants . I had a lot of time on my hands . But what have you really experienced ? Not much . Nothing . You must have imagined doing this . About a million times . But this was your first time ? Yes . This was my first time . ( CHUCKLES ) This is pretty . It 's my wedding ring . I haven 't been with a woman since she died . I thought I was the last human on Earth . ( CRICKETS CHIRPING ) ( CRICKETS STOP CHIRPING ) ( RUSTLING ) What is it ? ( FOOTSTEPS PATTERING ) ( WHISPERS ) What 's wrong ? Get dressed . ( CRAWLER GROWLING ) JUDY : ( SCREAMING ) Stover ! Stover ! Stover ! ( GRUNTING ) JUDY : Stover ! ( GRUNTING ) ( STOVER SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTS ) JUDY : Stover ! ( STOVER SCREAMING ) JUDY : Stover , help me ! Stover , help ! ( SCREAMING ) Where are they taking us ? Stover ! Stover ! ( GROWLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( JUDY GROANING ) ( COUGHS ) Don 't ! Stop it ! Don 't ! Don 't ... ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ( SOFT GROWLING ) ( GROWLING ) I 'm Judy . What 's your name ? Can you please ... ( GASPS ) What ? ( GROANS ) ( CRAWLERS MUTTERING ) ( STOVER GROANS ) ( COOING EXCITEDLY ) ( CRAWLER SNARLING ) ( CRAWLER GROWLING ) ( SQUEALS ) ( WHIMPERS ) ( SHRIEKS ) ( SQUEALING ) ( GROANING ) ( GASPS ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( GROWLS ) ( GROANING ) ( GROANS ) ( CRAWLER GROWLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) Infinisynth . That sign , it 's Infinisynth . I 'm from Infinisynth . ( SIGHING ) That 's right . I 'm from Infinisynth and you must release me . You must release me and take me to Stover . ( SIGHS ) No ! ( GROANS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GROANING ) What has become of you , Claude ? Where are your thoughts ? So , Claude , another one . Skinny . Hair needs cutting , but she 'll do in a pinch . Seen too much ? No . No . No , not seen enough . Where 's Stover ? What are you gonna do to me ? That 's for us to know . Claude , get things ready . Who are you ? I 'm Cornelia . And this is Claude . We 're your friends , dear . We 'll take good care of you . We 'll watch over you . That 's what friends are for . ( GASPS ) Claude , those are unattractive noises . What 's your name , dear ? Judy . You 're from the surface , aren 't you ? Have you seen the sky ? Liar ! ( GASPS ) There is no sky . ( EXHALES ) You don 't know how lucky you are . I 'll never be as lucky . Nor Claude . We can carry no seeds , but we can serve . But you , well ... it 's the most beautiful experience a woman can have . Nothing can compare with ... Nothing can ... There 's nothing ! There 's nothing . There 's no sores , no scars , nothing ! But you 're an outworlder . All OutWorlders carry the disease . All but ... A dreamer . Oh , my . JUDY : As I told that girl before you came , I 'm from Infinisynth . And you must release me . I 've come a long way across the Deadlands , and I 've come for you . Free me , and the salvation is yours . ( CLAUDE GROANS ) Well , my little brain-screwed bitch , this does change a few things . ( DRONES GROWLING ) ( CLANKS ) Jesus ! I 'm sorry ! ( BONE CRUSHING ) ( DRONE SHRIEKING ) ( BELCHING ) Untie me ! I 'm sick of this shit ! Oh , you 'll get sick , my pretty . I 'll see to that . And I 'll see to it before the Seer sees you . Don 't go away . JUDY : Claude ? Oh , Claude , you must help me . Claude , you must ! It 's too bad you 're so pretty , my pretty one . But you won 't be pretty for long . You know , you could still be good for bloating after this , but only in the hatchery . No solo arrangements . No Seer solos . No ! This is gonna hurt a little , then a lot . ( GRUNTS ) ( SYRINGE SHATTERING ) You are a tough little bitch , aren 't you ? No matter . There 's more . You 'll calm down . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ( LOW GROWLING ) ( DRONE WHIMPERING ) ( EXCLAIMS IN PAIN ) ( DRONE GROANING ) He 's no good to us anymore . He shall rise with the dream . Claude , turn the scream for a cycle of twenty . Oh , and Claude ? Mind the chamber with care . ( SIREN SOUNDING ) ( DRONES GRUNTING ) ( CLANKS ) ( GROANS ) ( DRONE CRYING ) ( GASPS ) Listen to me carefully , Claude . There really is a sky , you know . There 's a whole other world . You don 't have to live in the mud . If you 'd let me , I 'd take you with me . Help me . I can bring you to InWorld , to Infinisynth . You could become a dreamer like me . You can . There 's a way , just help me find my friend . We 'll all go together . We 'll all go together to Infinisynth . ( MUTTERS ) ( GROWLING ) ( GROANS ) Hey , you see what this is ? Do you know what this means ? We can get out of here . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) Hey ! Come on ! You 've done the right thing , Claude . Now , let 's go find Stover . ( GROWLING ) Judy ! JUDY : Stover ! Let go of me , you idiots ! ( SNARLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMING ) Judy ! Where are we ? Our land is full . What treasures has she borne ? Bless you . Save this offering . We are not ready for it yet , but someday it will increase our power . Break open the casing . Inside is a small motor . Remove it . It may be useful . Junk . Cornelia , you 've been keeping things from me . You would have gotten to her soon enough . But when , Cornelia ? After a rather untoward preparation by you ? I 'm a dreamer . You have no power over me . If you don 't release me , you 'll never be a part of the dream . How shall we serve you ? A man was captured with me . Take me to him and return us both to the surface . Why , O great slotgoddess ? Because you 've made a terrible mistake ! And if you disobey me , you will all suffer greatly . Suffer ? Oh , dear . No one here has ever suffered before . Poor silly girl . I 'm afraid you 're not the first one to fall down a hole . So , how are things back at home ? How could you be part of this ? To use an archaic expression , it 's the only game in town . And there can be only one game master . Is this contrition ? You seriously overstepped the proprieties , didn 't you ? Some penance is in order . Your Claude shall rise and enter the dream . Prepare her ! CORNELIA : No , you can 't . Don 't tell me what I can or can 't do . This is bullshit ! You fraud ! Cornelia , you 've got to learn to share your toys . ( GASPS IN FEAR ) And , dear , ( SOBBING ) don 't ever cross me again . ( CRYING ) ( GRUNTS ) Because of you . I 've lost her because of you ! ( STOVER YELLS ) ( CRAWLERS SNARLING ) ( CRAWLERS SNARLING ) ( GASPING ) ( GRUNTING ) She leaves behind her vision , so that we may follow her into the dream . ( SCREAMS ) ( CRYING ) ( SCREAMING ) Claude ! ( SOBBING ) No . ( SCREAMING ) ( MACHINE STOPS ) This is the wine of the blessed . For the blessed have risen . They are now free . They are part of the dream . Let us partake of what they have left behind , so that we may all share in what they have become in the hope that when we depart this life we shall all be reborn as dreamers . ( WHIMPERING ) ( GRUNTS ) She died for you ! ( COUGHING ) Bring me the girl . No ! ( SOBBING ) No ! Please , don 't ! ( GROANS ) Stover ! Stop him ! ( SCREAMS ) SEER : An OutWorlder . Take him below , calm him down , and put him back to work . Judy , I 'm sorry . ( SOBBING ) Stover ! Yes , let it go . Let it all go . No . No ! I 've missed you , too . No . Oh , we 've been apart so long , you can 't leave now . Besides , Judy , there 's nowhere to go . How could this have happened to you ? I was exiled . These people took me under . They 'd never seen an expansion port before . I convinced them that I could change their world , save them . Oddly enough , I have . Saved them , how ? My little show must seem tawdry to you after Infinisynth , but these rituals are all these people have to look forward to . I wish I hadn 't found you . I wish you 'd been dead . Believe me , Judy , I 've wanted to die countless times . Down here , death can be a blessing . But I 've denied myself the pleasure . You should have killed me . No . You 're strong . You 're like me . You can stand it all . I see it in you . My father . Yes , Judy . And you 're a part of me . But can you understand me ? The necessity of all of this ? What will it take to make you understand ? I want to try . Show me , and I 'll try . ( STOVER GRUNTING ) Okay ! ( YELLS ) ( SCREAMS ) You bastards ! ( YELLING ) My father , a freak . A monster . Am I , Judy ? And what are you ? Why did you leave InWorld ? Because InWorld is finished . I 'm the last generation . They don 't even bother to reproduce anymore . They 're already dead . But you and I , we 're different , aren 't we ? We wanted life . This is life . This is hell . No . Hell is for the dead . But here , it 's life . Look around you . These people would never believe in a God of love , a God of light . Yet , I 've given them a reason to live . What reason ? Dreadful though it is , I 've given them a structure . A religion , hope . They 're blind , Judy , and I see for them . They 've survived . I 'm sorry you don 't see it as I do . But you will , soon . ( STOVER SCREAMING IN PAIN ) No ! ( GASPING ) They 'd been living in the landfill for some time before I came , but they 'd forgotten what any of this was for . I 've helped them to remember , to use it as a foundation for the future . Now they have a purpose with each new day . They don 't exactly look happy in their work . Oh , sometimes it takes a bit of encouragement . The carrot and the stick ? In a manner of speaking . ( CRAWLER GROANS ) And the stick ? Sometimes as literal as that . We have a number of short-term problems , Judy , that I 'm trying to address . A solution to one in particular could solve most of the others in the long term . Your people must love you . Skilled labor is at a premium , sometimes OutWorlders are a help in that area . Willingly ? You must know that a few must sacrifice for the greater good . For your greater good . You learn quickly . I have nothing to learn from you . Really ? Is this as far as you 're willing to go ? I 'll go as far as I have to , but with Stover . He didn 't sink under . He survived without all of this . You think he 's going to fit into your little future world ? So far , he 's fitting in very nicely . Stover ! ( SOBS ) Stover , I love you . What have you done to him ? ( GASPS ) Nasty little creatures , really . Recent mutations with an unusual life cycle . The females swim into the orifices of a host to lay their eggs on membranous tissue . The males lodge in the nervous system to keep the host calm during incubation . The larvae are parasitic . In the early stages , they feed on nervous tissue . The host organism starts to twitch as its dendrites are consumed . It 's said to be pleasurable , like being tickled on the inside . ( SOBBING ) Please let him out . Get him out ! I 'm afraid it 's too late for him . ( CRYING ) No ! I thought you were strong , Judy . I thought you could face reality , not as you want it to be , but as it is . It doesn 't have to be like this . It does , but not in the future . We can change it , Judy , you and I. We can remake this world . What are you talking about ? You and I , Judy , we 're from InWorld . We 've not been exposed all our lives to all the poisons and diseases that the Crawlers and the OutWorlders have carried for years . We 're of pure stock . We could rule for decades , and our offspring , for generations after us . No ! We can . You must . No ! ( PANTING ) I 've got to get out of here . ( BABY COOING ) Cornelia ? ( BABY CRYING ) WOMAN : Oh , my God . ( MOANS ) ( WHISPERING ) Oh , my God . ( SHUDDERS ) ( BABY GROWLING ) ( CRYING ) You monster ! No , I do what 's necessary . The Crawlers are like mules . Males and females unable to breed successfully . You can see from the offspring . Cornelia is barren . We 're limited in what we can do for them to improve procreation . But you , Judy , you and I still have a chance . And you even have a choice . A life with me in my chambers , ruling beside me , or remaining here with her , like her . Either way , you will bear my children ! No ! ( SEER GROANS ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SIREN SOUNDING ) ( CRAWLERS MUMBLING ) ( GASPING ) No ! ( GRUNTING ) Good night , Cornelia . ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANS ) ( GASPING ) Come on , Stover . Wake up ! Stover ! Please wake up , please . ( CHUCKLES ) Yes . That 's right . ( GROANS ) I 'm willing to do what has to be done . Are you ? Oh , yes . And I 'll make sure one of us is dead before you ever touch me . That won 't be necessary . ( JUDY GRUNTING ) God . No ! ( GROWLING ) ( GROANS ) I never imagined I could devour my own child , but I can . Here , I can do anything . It 's wonderful . ( SOBS ) Start it ! ( CRAWLERS MUMBLING ) Oh ! No ! Now you can see it all . No ! ( SCREAMING ) ( STOVER YELLING ) ( GASPING ) ( SEER GROWLS ) ( JUDY SHRIEKS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( RIPPING ) ( SCREAMING ) No ! ( SEER SCREAMING ) ( GROANS ) ( CHUCKLING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( CRAWLERS MUMBLING ) Oh ! Oh , no , Stover . Here . Take it . Drink it . ( SOBBING ) Help me , please . We have to get out of here . Leave ? Oh , no , we can 't leave . We belong here . ( GASPS ) No ! No , Judy . I love you . Judy , come back ! STOVER : They need you here ! Judy , wait ! Judy ! Come back ! ( GRUNTING ) - STOVER : Don 't go up there . - JUDY : No ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop ! JUDY : Let go ! - STOVER : Stay here with me ! - Let go of me ! No ! ( SCREAMING ) STOVER : Judy ! No ! Look , we 're over the Deadlands ! But it 's the only way out ! ( SHOUTS ) Judy ! Judy ! Judy ! I love you ! Judy . ( GASPS ) Judy ! ( PANTING ) Judy . Please come back . I need your help ! Oh , my God , Stover . What should I do ? The Deadlands ... We have to get out of the Deadlands . Stover ? Stover ! ( GASPS ) What 's wrong , Judy ? ( IN SYSOP 'S VOICE ) Why aren 't you hooked in ? ( ECHOING ) Take a deep breath . Relax . Sometimes it takes a moment to recover . None of it ... None of it was real ? That ' depends on what you mean , Judy . Is it really like that on the outside ? I wouldn 't know . I 've never been there . I can 't believe it was all just ... Yes . It can be any shape you want it to be . Reality ? It 's up to you . There 's no place like home . Good . I didn 't think this lesson would be wasted on you . There 's a reason you had to go through this , Judy . You 're exceptional , and I can 't continue in this job forever . Someone , of course , must take responsibility . You 've inherited my strengths , my powers . You 've passed the test . You 've proven it . You never left . You were right here . You were always with me ? Yes . Yet , for all our lives , we have only these few real moments together . The new Systems Operator . It 's for you to run Infinisynth . To absorb all the dreams , all the hopes and fantasies . All the minds online . It will seem frightening at first . But then you 'll realize it 's everything . What is it ? Nothing . I have no more questions . Good . ( MACHINE CHIMING )

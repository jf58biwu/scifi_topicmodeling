Gary peed in the jacuzzi . You peed in the jacuzzi ? Gentlemen , you 're up . If we don 't get that disk back I could lose all my computer files . Including one special file that 's taught us a lot about life . Ah , yes . I 'm a tetris fan myself . Boys , I appreciate your dilemma , but allow me to speak frankly . I am but a cog . Moments after I confiscated that disk it passed into the hands of another cog in turn passed it to any one of a million other cogs . - You don 't know where it is ? - If I knew that , I 'd be a much bigger cog . WOMAN : If you want to see my tattoo dance , press F2 now . ( Beep ) We 'll be safe here . Damien would never risk shooting you in a public place . Of course not . Not our old friend Damien .

 - What 's happening ? - It 's crack . Get some help . Crackheads take up all our time . - What have we got ? - Hemmorage . - Vaginal bleeding . - Probably a street abortion . - We 've got to open her up . - All the O. R. ' s are full . - We can 't wait . I 'll operate . - You can 't ! Just do it ! Get him out of here . 15 years on the job and you 're gonna get me canned in one day . Here we go . Forceps ! Where is it ? Clamp ! - You got her . - All right , I 've got her . Dave , get out of here . Now ! Iabraccio ! What the hell are you doing ? Randall Steckle , " Diary of a Surgeon . " No . Randall Steckle , " Diary of a Surgeon to be . " Randall Steckle , " Making of a ... " " Forging of a Surgeon . " No , pretentious . Randall Steckle , " Genesis " ? " Genesis of a Young Surgeon . " Brilliant ! Morning . Nice work . Keep it up . Suddenly , even though I was in a coma , I saw myself . Suddenly , even though I was in a coma , I saw myself . like , from above , looking down . Ralph , my husband , was crying . The doctor was saying I was dying . I saw myself in the bed and everything . I started to float out into the hall . Then into this tunnel toward this light . It was the most beautiful light I ever saw . I heard this voice . It was the most beautiful voice I ever heard . And it said : " I 'm going to take your baby . " " But you are going back . " And I woke up , and there was Ralph and the doctor . I was legally dead for 41 / 2 minutes . But I didn 't see no tunnel and I didn 't see no light . I did ... and it was so beautiful ! - I was in this garden ... - This tunnel and this light ... Then this guide ... and a chariot and music . Terry , I think they 'd better get you off medication . Thanks . - What 's up ? - Good morning . There 's trouble in E. R. You 'd better watch your ass . Why are you always asking the patients about death ? I 'll be late for class . Thanks , Edna . The spoils of arthritis . Some rather resilient inflammatory tissue here . We 're now under the transverse arch of the foot . The metatarsals ... Brilliant , Dr. Steckle . Bring all that talent with you tonight . Nelson , about tonight . I like you . I have to decline on moral grounds . There enough atrocity in the world without your own little horror . It 's ignorance we fear . When did truth and knowledge become a horror ? Especially to a scientist and a genius like yourself . - How are you doing , Mannus ? - Fine . I 've been meaning to ask you , are you dating anyone ? - Identify . - Costodiaphragmatic recess . Is it offensive if I make conversation ? Sometimes it 's nice to open up . Like old Lenny here , he 's open . - Identify . - Pylorus . I 've heard all the rumours and nicknames about you , Rachel . I 'm sure you 're a very warm woman . Not in the least bit repressed . - Identify . - Your brains . You want to come over to my place ? Dr. Hurley , I need a word with Dr. Mannus . - I already said no to this . - Steckle and Hurley are in . Two of the top GPA 's in the school . I need you to handle the injections and the I . V. I have no interest in watching you kill yourself . I think you do . Good morning , class . Today 's exam will be scaled . Three A 's will be given , five B 's and ten C 's . The remaining four will get D 's and F 's . As in life , you 're competing not with me , yourself or this exam , but with each other . There are a lot of others who 'd like to make a name for themselves . It 's a shame that the people with the ability don 't have the nerve . - All right , we 'll be there . - Speak for yourself , Joseph . Sure , it 'll be dramatic , Nelson . You 'll cry or faint , puke at best . But then what ? I don 't think you have the balls . You just bring the equipment . I 'll bring my balls . Did you hear about Labraccio ? Dave , it 's a four-month suspension . It won 't affect your scholarship . Forget it , I 'm out of here . You 're the best they 've ever had . They won 't let you walk away . - Besides , you were wrong . - No , damn it ! She was dying . I saved her life . What would you have done ? They have to make an example out of you to protect their insurance bond . They 'll take you back next term . It doesn 't matter . I 'd do the same thing again . I know you would . That 's why I need you there tonight . There are a few people I 'd like to kill , but you 're not one of them . I don 't want to die . I want to come back with the answers to death ... and life . I can get there with the others but I need you . I need you to bring me back . Please . I 'm sorry , man , I can 't do that . Just walk away , Dave . Go climb a mountain . I don 't understand you any more . You burn your career on a stranger . Now you turn your back on a friend . look , I 'm real sorry about what happened today . - I won 't make it back without you . - So don 't do it . Dave ... What if it works ? I don 't want to be buried on Saturday . It costs $ 150 more to be buried on Saturday . Mrs. Amsler , you 're doing much better . { y : ib } leave a message after the beep . { y : ib } I know you 're home . - Don 't be late . Bring the camera . - What camera ? - Thank God he called a specialist . - No lectures , okay ? You 're engaged . Grow up . I 'm recording a few last adventures before resigning myself to monogamy . I didn 't realise . I thought you were just a pussy marauder . What the hell are we doing here ? This is goodbye med-school . Ten bucks says he shits his drawers and we 're out of here . Not those lights . Security will come running . Set up over the grate . I just got the boiler going . - You 're really going to do this ? - Just humour the man . Take me down with nitrous , sodium pentathol and a cold blanket . I 've got some chilled D5W . When my temperature is 86 % , hit me with 200 joules . The shock will stop my heart . Then take my mask off . - You said Rachel was coming . - Steckle , shut the door . You handle the injections . When the EEG flatlines , the brain is dead . I 'll be exploring . Give me 30 seconds . Set the blanket to warm and take me up to 93 % . Inject 1cc of adrenalin , and Joe , come in with the defibs . - You bring me back to life . - With brain damage . Resembling in many ways ... a Cabbage Patch doll . Not with a body temperature of 86 % . Dr. Mannus , will you handle the injections ? Wait a minute . Quite simply , why are you doing this ? To see if there 's anything beyond death . Philosophy failed . Religion failed . Now it 's up to physical science . Mankind deserves to know . You 're doing this for mankind ? This letter absolves you of any responsibility . This isn 't for mankind . You want to get on " 60 Minutes " sandwiched between Andy Rooney and the commercials . " Tonight , a medical student who experienced death and came back . " - Fame is inevitable . - That 's the wrong reason . Dr. Hurley , electrodes . Don 't you want to be on " 60 Minutes " ? Rachel , how about a little nitrous ? At least I 'll go out with a laugh . Dr. Hurley , get the blanket . We 're all professionals . I 'm sure this 'll go very smoothly . Can I have your apartment ? - It 's a joke ! - One minute . Don 't be late . Start filming now . You 'll have a complete record of the experiment . Promise me you 'll go through with this . One little kiss goodbye . I 'll see you soon . - 96 % . - This letter doesn 't mean shit . let him sleep . He 'll have a wet dream and think he went to heaven . - Now I know why I 'm here . - I 've stated my feelings , goodbye . Are you willing to risk your future for Nelson 's fame ? Someone 's coming ! - Is he dead ? - He 's only sleeping . Talk some sense into these people . I 'll do it . I 've got nothing to lose . - Just his life ! - I can get him back . - Just stop his heart for a minute . - Don 't think I couldn 't have . No ! - Clear . - What are you doing ? - A systole . - You 're killing him . - No wonder you got tossed . - Stop this shit . I did not come to medical school to murder my classmates ! Flatline . They 're getting smaller . He 's dying . - Brain death . Now it 's real . - Start filming . He 's dead , isn 't that enough ? Let me try to bring him back . - Just watch the door . - We 're in the room with a dead man . - One minute to go . - Start filming ! - 30 seconds to go . - Okay , let 's heat him up . - 20 seconds . 89 % , 90 % ... - Sodium bicarbonate ready . I 'm charging the paddles . Monitor the EKG . - Body temp : 93 % . - Here we go . - What have we got ? - Not a goddamn thing . Up me to 300 . Begin CPR . Sodium bicarbonate and eppy . My God ! Not a goddamn thing ! - 98 % . - Hit him again . 350 . Nothing . Got him ! - Steckle , help me . - More eppy . In . We got REM . - Nelson , can you hear us ? - Welcome back , man . - The crazy motherfucker did it ! - Jesus Christ ! Steckle , that 's some bedside manner . You 'll make one hell of a doctor . Suck me . Can you recall any specific emotion ? Heat , cold , anything like that ? - You can 't be specific . - Did you see a tunnel of light ? No , but there is something out there . It 's comforting . Have you any idea how big this is ? He could use some air . You guys could get us some fluids . - Thanks for saving my life . - It was so much fun . - How do you feel , wise one ? - Like a highly-tuned instrument . Can you hear the traffic on the lake shore ? Underneath that there 's a hum . It 's the street lights . Even fainter ... I can hear a kind of dragging sound . - And it 's getting louder . - No . I not only hear it , I can feel it . Yeah , your prognosis is excellent . You 'll be great on " 60 Minutes " . - It 's bigger than that , David . - I 'm sure you 'll see to that . - You 're not buying any of this . - You forgot ... I 'm an atheist . Are you all right for a few minutes ? - How 's he doing ? - He thinks he 's back from the dead . - How 's he doing ? - He thinks he 's back from the dead . - That 's what we did , right ? - All we did was get lucky . - I would like to go next . - Yeah , I 'd like to be famous , too . - It 's not about fame . - They 'll build monuments to you . - Small stone ones . " Rest in Peace . " - I 'm going next . I 'd be willing to go 1minute 20 seconds . 1 : 30 . Are you two so competitive that you 're willing to bet your lives ? 1 : 30 . That 's it then . Not a bad price to pay for fame and glory . Die to be a hero , but don 't die to be a celebrity . Champ ? - Someone ought to stay with him . - I will . Are you okay ? I 'd like to go home . Are you okay ? You were hyperventilating . Your blood pressure will rise as your cardiovascular vessels constrict . - God , you 're beautiful . - Get some rest . I bet 24 hours ago you didn 't think you 'd be spending the night here . You were lucky last night , Nelson . Don 't push it . ENGAGEM ENT PARTY { y : ib } I want to wish you two { y : ib } the best of everything together . Hello , may I please speak to Anne Coldren ? Anne ? { y : ib } Hi , I 've been thinking about you . { y : ib } How are you ? Counting the days to Thanks giving break . I 've got to transfer to a school closer to you or get a faster car . - We should 've married last summer . - My mother wasn 't ready yet . You know , you 're the best . If anything happens ... - Joe , what 's wrong ? - l don 't know. I 'm just tired . I 'm not making any sense . I should go . - Joe , you 're scaring me . - It 's okay , nothing 's wrong . I love you . Bye . - Nothing . - Starting CPR . - CPR and adrenalin , and nothing ! - What 's going on ? Come on , Joe ! - Come on , Nelson , let me try . - We 're running out of time ! - Let me try . - I 'm doing everything I can ! - Nelson , step back . - Come on , Joe ! I got him . Oxygen . 0xygen ready . CPR successful . Hurley lives . It 's okay , Joe . - It was great . - Here it comes . Define " great " . I don 't know , it 's not thinking about the past or the future . - It 's difficult to explain . - Yeah , dying is funny that way . Nelson 's right , there definitely is activity beyond death . - Absolutely . - The experience was strange . - It was almost erotic . - He 's dead and he gets laid . What do you mean , erotic ? I don 't want you to think it was wantonly sexual . No , that never would have occurred to me . It was friendly . It was something vaguely feminine guiding me . This could be the conquest of our generation . The last great frontier . First you had the sea , then America , the West , the Moon Mr. Leary , drugs , the inner journey ... Our former First Lady and the outer journey ... - But this is ours ! - We did have disco . - Fuck the baby boomers . - Watch your mouth . - l found something . Remember ? - I came back from the dead tonight . It doesn 't surprise me . We had Elvis in here last night . Pay when you 're ready , okay ? - Was it difficult getting back ? - Not that I remember . But you remember everything else ? I think you guys are full of shit . - I 'm not buying any of this . - I wouldn 't buy it either unless I 'd been there . So what about it , Dave ? - An atheist has nothing to lose . - I 'm going next . Nobody 's going next . You 're looking for answers where there are none . You just saw what you wanted to see . Give it up . It 's too dangerous . We can 't turn back now . I 'm going further . 1 : 50 . Two minutes ... I changed my mind . Two minutes . - 2 : 10 . - 2 : 20 . It looks like we found a winner . Enjoying yourself , Nelson ? Joe ... Was there anything negative about your experience ? No . Nothing . Good . - Hold on . - Was that your idea of chivalry ? - Were you trying to show me up ? - Not everything is about you . Nobody seems to want me to go under . I don 't need your protection . What do you need , Mannus ? What do you think I need ? When someone is as smart and driven as you are , and very beautiful , it makes the rest of us very nervous . - Why did you change your mind ? - I 'm the sceptic on this . If I see there 's nothing out there , there 's no reason for us to go on . How do you explain the similarity in death experiences ? People from different cultures see the same things in the same order . Maybe there 's a hormone released by the brain at the time of death . No , you 're reaching . What if you go and there is something out there ? - Then you can kill yourself , too . - I 'm not going to kill myself . I 'm glad to hear that , Mannus . I might miss you . - So why this obsession with death ? - It 's just an interest . A personal interest . Goodnight . - Can I drive you home ? - No , thanks . I didn 't take the money . I got the toaster , but too many appliances make you love me . Right , Nelson ? In the end , we all know what we 've done . Champ ? Come here , Champ . Come here , boy . What are you doing here , kid ? Are you all right ? Are you okay ? Are you lost ? Halloween morning . Rotting pumpkins , burning leaves , black cats mating like rats in the alley . It were as if we felt no fear . As if we were already dead , and had nothing to lose by dying . Because we lived life so well , and loved life so much , we imagined ourselves immortal . Overwhelming the powers that be with our passion for science . Or maybe we were fucked in the head . Hey , I 'm Joe Hurley . You 're Terry , right ? - You had a near-death experience . - I don 't want to talk about it . Wait a minute . I had a near-death experience also . I need someone to talk to . This thing changed my life . - At first , they didn 't believe me . - What the hell do they know ? If you have to go to class , maybe we can discuss it one night this week ? All that day I knew something was going to happen . I 've always had premonitions . Once , my aunt was to fly ... { y : ib } Why did you do this to me , Joe ? No ! Trick or treat . It 's Halloween . There 's a full moon . Aren 't we pushing it a little bit ? I 'm sorry I 'm late . I ran into some very big guys . - Let me take a look at it . - I 'm fine . - Where the hell have you been ? - I don 't feel well . Look at you . Just worry about your camera . Nice outfit . - Are you ready ? - I 'm ready . Who are you supposed to be ? Boner Man ? - 2 : 20 , don 't forget . - You just hurry up and get back . You can buy us breakfast . Don 't let go of the rope . { y : ib } Hoka hey . See you soon . 20 cc 's sodium pentathol in . - 86 % . - 200 joules charged . Clear . Flatline . What hangs in the air palpably ? ls it hope , or the fear of death ? - Shut up , Steckle . - No , you shut up ! What if he didn 't make it back ? Would you miss him , Rachel ? One minute . - 90 % . - Give him another five seconds . - Why not ten ? We 've got the time . - Are you serious ? { y : ib } Joey , I trusted you . - Stations . Joe , move yourself . - Come on , no kidding around here . Who 's kidding ? - What 's going on here ? - 92 % . Joe , get it ! Come on . 2 : 15 , 2 : 16 , 2 : 17 , 2 : 18 ... 2 : 20 . Hand it over . This is my lab . 300 joules . Charged . Clear . Breathe ! - 1,000 , 2,000 ... What comes next ? - Knock it off , Nelson ! - 5,000 . Breathe . - 300 joules charged . Clear . Come on , Dave . - That 's it ! - That 's not it . It 's a v-fib ! - Try lidocaine . - Not yet . - Come on , Dave . - Raise it to 360 . Clear . - Try lidocaine . - Three fucking minutes . Starting CPR . Joe , keep filming . I 'm going to bring him back . { y : ib } You lied to me , Joe . - We 've got him . - 1mg eppy in . That was close . That was way too close . - Hoka hey . - What did you say ? { y : ib } Hoka hey . It 's the war cry of the Sioux Indians . It means ... " Today is a good day to die . " So was it , Dave ? I don 't know if I was dead . I may have felt something . A dream ... or just a bunch of stuff stored up inside my mind . You were brain-dead . Some electrical current circulating through my body ... It would 've shown up on the EEG . You were dead . So what happened ? It 's hard to verbalise . It 's like being paranoid without the fear . like being watched . You guys were standing over me . - Who could be watching ? - The dead . The sceptic did feel something . I 'm going again . - No way ! I 've been bumped twice . - Four minutes . - Labraccio went for 3 : 50 . - That was a mistake . - Under four minutes is pointless . - Nobody is going for four minutes ! - 4 : 25 . - 5 minutes . - I 'm next or I 'm out for good . - It 'll be hard without her . - But without me ... - Or me . Well , mutiny at last . I trusted you with a brilliant idea . It was the chance of a lifetime . - Give it a rest , Nelson . - None of you had my foresight ! Rachel , you want to go next ? Be my guest , but this was my idea ! You 're tourists ! I would 've gone 3 : 30 or 3 : 40 . I still might . But 4 : 25 is crazy . We 're pushing the five-minute mark . It 's dangerous . { y : ib } You shit , Joe . { y : ib } You said you loved me , Joe . - l love you , Joe . - Buddy ? Skelator , are you listening to me ? Thanks for staying . I 'm on the early shift . You seem fine . I 'll see you later . - About tonight ... - Don 't try to talk me out of it . Why are you doing this ? I 've lost people that are close to me . I want to make sure they 've gone to a good place . Is that so trivial ? To tell you the truth , it 's the best reason I 've heard yet for going . There 's something I didn 't tell you about last night . I had this feeling that if I had gone any further that there was something out there protecting me . Something good . - So you don 't need to go under . - The atheist now believes in God ? I 'm trying to tell you that I don 't want you to do it . Think about all we 'll have to talk about ... when you bring me back . I 'm dying . Don 't lie to me . I 'm dying . Don 't lie to me . Mrs. Amsler , you 've fought well . - Sometimes we just have to let go . - That 's what the voices say . - What voices ? - They say , " Have you done enough ? " " Have you told everyone you love them ? " I have . They 're friendly voices . They 're telling you what you need to know . - What ? - That you have someplace to go . - Do you believe that ? - Yes , I do . Yes , I do . Hey , fellatio ! Got a match ? Well , I do . Your face and my ass . - Your breath and a buffalo fart . - Do I know you ? You don 't know jack shit ! Butt-wad , needle-dick , cock-bite , jack-off , limp-wrist , banana-breath , shit-bird , bird-turd , turd-face , kiss-ass , brown-nose , macho-wimp , limp-dick ! What 's the matter ? Gonna cry ? Cry-baby Davie . Shit-faced , rat-turd , ass-licking , son of a bitch . - How did it happen ? - I was playing hockey . - About last night ... - It 's okay . - No-show Labraccio . - That 's not like him . - It 's his way of trying to stop me . - It 's not a good idea to continue . - We don 't need David . - Can you do this ? - Can you trust me ? - No , but let 's do it anyway . Nitrous on . See you soon . How long 's she been under ? We 're bringing her back . - She hasn 't been under long enough . - Just do it , Joe . Don 't expect any kisses for this . - Aborting fourth experiment . Why ? - Why don 't you ask Dr. Death ? - What 's going on ? - We 're bringing Rachel back early . - Drop it . Think about Rachel . - Joe 's right . 91 % . Let 's be ready . Rachel , don 't go in there . { y : ib } I told you not to do that . Denny ! It 's your fault ! - Nothing . - Take me up to 300 . Come on , Rachel . 300 joules . Clear ! - Got her ! . - V-fib . We don 't have her . - It 's okay , we 'll get her . - Step me up to 360 . - What did you do to me ? - A short , maybe a circuit . - Joe , you charged the battery ? - Shit ! Starting CPR . Bag her , Steckle . No pulse . - It 's not working . Joe , take over . - She 's been under 4 minutes . We 're moving to bretylium . It 's the only way . Don 't do it , you 'll fry her . Nelson ! Please , don 't ! You 'll bring her back ? Come on , Mannus . Iidocaine in . Come on back to us . Come on . Wait ! I heard something . Oxygen ! She 's back . - Why did you stop us ? - Something happened to me today . There was a girl ... Winnie Hicks . I went to school with her . We used to make fun of her . On the train , she started calling me names . Right in front of me ! - She was still only ten years old . - Maybe you fell asleep . - No , it was not a dream . - I 've seen some odd things , too . - I thought it was brain damage . - In your case it probably is . Shut that off , Steckle , this is personal . I 've been haunted by images of women that I secretly videotaped . They 're all members of the Joe Hurley Video Library . What about you , Nelson ? Who 's come looking for you ? His name 's Billy Mahoney . He 's a kid we picked on in school . - It 's no big deal . - Then what happened to your face ? - The little guy gets carried away . - Wait a minute . I can understand Dave nodding off , and pervert here having flashbacks . You 're saying this guy physically touches you . That is not possible ! - This is too weird . - Weird ? We 've experienced death . Now somehow we 've brought our sins back physically . - When did you know about this ? - After Joe went . - But you didn 't say a word ! - Jesus Christ ! We 're scientists . It 's reckless , immoral and unethical for you to withhold your findings . Rachel Mannus may have the answers to life and death . She was under for five minutes ! If she walks out of that ladies ' room with those answers , the whole world will worship her . - Just like you do . - You should 've told us , Nelson . - You wouldn 't have done it . - At least we 'd have had a choice ! We 're fucked . - Rachel , are you all right ? - I 'm okay . I said I was fine . Are you guys gonna watch me ? Come on , Billy Mahoney . Give it your best shot . I dare you ... I fucking dare you . - Things from our past want revenge ? - I 'm not exactly sure how it works . But if you see anything , I want you to talk to me about it . You can tell the doctor . - I 'll be in the living room . - Is it people we 've hurt ? Did something happen tonight ? No . Just try and get some rest . - How 's she doing ? - I think she 's hiding something . - What did Nelson do to that kid ? - I don 't know ! - We must keep each other informed . - Yeah , I 'm sorry . Why don 't you guys take off ? I 'll stay with her . I 'm sorry . We 're gonna get you , Billy Mahoney ! No ! Stop , Nelson ! - How are you doing ? - I 'm late . I 'll see you later . - Wait . Where are you going ? - I 've got to stop her . Good morning , Rachel . No ... no ... Her voices were wrong . There 's nothing beautiful out there . - Losing them is part of our work . - But I was wrong . You look like you 're enjoying the day . - Don 't you remember me , Joe ? - Yes , of course . - Are you a model ? You could be . - Look , I 've got to go . I 'm not picking you up . I just picked you out . Mind if I buy you a drink ? - I 'll call you this weekend . - Fine , I 'm in the book . - Hey , gorgeous . - Who are you ? - What are you doing ? - Some crazy girl ... Do I know you ? Would you like to ? We don 't have to do anything . We can just lie together . Hold each other in our underwear . I 'll call you . I promise . I 'm tired of playing the field . We can stop whenever you want . It 'll only make our relationship better . I 've never felt like this before . Of course I respect you . - Call me whenever you want . - Show me that you love me . You 're not real ! Anne , is that you ? - Is it really you ? - You sounded so upset on the phone . - I was worried . I took the bus . - What a great surprise . - How long have you been here ? - Long enough to see your tapes . My God ! You 're gonna think I 'm leaving you because you slept with those girls . They meant nothing to me . I wish they had meant something . If you had cared for any of them , - - I could have fought that . But to film all those girls ... To have so little respect ... Those women trusted you . You have no understanding of trust . - It 's not what you think . - Yes , it is . Hello , is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks ? Hello , is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks ? Do you have a daughter Winnie , about 26 years old ? You do ? I 'm David Labraccio . I was in school with Winnie . Yeah , my parents still live there . I wanted to get in touch with her and I was wondering ... Okay . Do you have her address ? Great . I really appreciate it . Bye . - Jesus ! - It looks as bad as it feels ? - You want me to take a look at it ? - No . How 's Rachel doing ? She didn 't come out of that bathroom with the answers to life and death . Where are you going ? Can I go ? - It 's a two hour drive . - I don 't want to be alone . You will remove the left kidney and dissect the lower intestines . Remove the ascending colon from the transverse colon . Proceed to the sigmoid colon and on to the appendix . - Where the hell are you going ? - Are you okay ? I would be fine if everyone would stop asking me if I 'm all right . - Is she getting the heebie-jeebies ? - I 'm spooking , too . Getting us kicked out of med-school won 't get Anne back . Mannus ! I 'll handle this . Back to work or suffer the consequences . Fuck it . - This must be it . - Winnie did well for herself . - She won 't even remember you . - It 's worth a shot . - Are you coming ? - No . listen , if anything happens ... . If you need me , just honk the horn . Ring , ring , ring . Dave , you should 've sent a letter . Anybody home ? - Hi , is your mother at home ? - Coming . Go in the house , baby . - Yes ? Can I help you ? - Yeah , I think you can . Are you Winnie Hicks ? From Claremont ? I 'm David Labraccio . We went to school together . I was a little smaller then . I just drove up from the city . That 's my truck . Hello , I 'm nice . He 's nice . We 're both fucking lunatics . Can I come in , please ? I 've got to hand it to you , Dave ... you 've got guts . This is beautiful . You 've done well for yourself . Well , it isn 't medical school . But I never liked school anyway . I wasn 't very good at it . - I 'm surprised you remember me . - I do remember you . I also remember the way we treated you back then . You were a little shy , and I was a real jerk ... and I 'm sorry . What are you talking about ? That was so long ago I don 't even remember . let 's not dredge up all that stuff . However we made you feel ... it was wrong . We were wrong . Go on . I have a family now . I haven 't been that ugly little girl in quite some time . You were never ugly . Why did you come here ? David , help ! I know how kids are . It didn 't mean anything . - I didn 't mean to come here ... - Winnie , are you all right ? I 'm fine , Ben . I 'm sorry if I made you feel bad . I didn 't want to hurt you again . I 'm gonna go . David ? Thank you . Are you sure ? Thanks . David , help ! Nelson , stop . Stop ! - Where 's Billy Mahoney ? - No one 's here but the two of us . let go ! Where the hell have you guys been ? - She freaked in class . - How are you doing ? Fine , for somebody who keeps seeing her father who 's been dead 20 years . " Death is beautiful . " What a bunch of crap . How are you doing , Nelson ? Okay ? I 'd like to thank you for the nightmare . You were so eager to jump on ... Welcome aboard . You withheld information . - I 'm sorry you 're so upset . - You 're not the only one at risk ! - I always felt this was unnatural . - Steckle , you didn 't risk a thing . - Stop ! We 're all in this together . - No , we 're not . Isn 't she strong ? So independent . When I get into trouble , I don 't drag everybody down with me . Come on ! What happened to you ? Caught with your videotapes down . You swore at a little girl . You 're having bad dreams about your daddy . - I 'm really sorry ! - You don 't know anything about me . But Dave does , doesn 't he ? Come on , they 're your sins . Live with them ... I do . You want to see death ? Take a good look . It is beautiful . You 've already hurt yourself . Do you want to hurt her , too ? Help him find Billy Mahoney . Just do it , all right ? - Don 't leave him alone . - Why do we want to find Billy ? Young Dr. Dave thinks he 's solved our karmic problems . - Atonement , gentlemen . - Atonement ? Wait a goddamn minute ! You 're always running away from me . Why don 't you talk to me ? - My father shot himself . - And you feel responsible ? There was this door in our hallway and I wasn 't supposed to go in ... Kids always feel responsible . You could not have been to blame . You said it yourself . People we 've wronged want revenge . I don 't know if this will help , but going to see Winnie Hicks ... I can 't explain , but it lifted ... just asking for forgiveness ... Winnie Hicks is alive . My father 's dead . Your father is in a good place . He wants you to let him go . Then why is he back ? Here . - Where the hell are we ? - We 'd better get you to a hospital . Come on , this is a short cut . I can 't believe I remember all this . - The neighbourhood 's falling apart . - Give me the keys ! { y : ib } Step on a crack { y : ib } break your mother 's back ... last one over is a rotten egg ! Come on , boys , salvation just ahead . This is a graveyard . Nelson , where the fuck are you ? This isn 't funny any more . It never was . - Where the hell are you ? - Right here . This is where Billy lives . Wake up , you little shit , you 've got company ! I knew he was here ... because I put him here . - Billy Mahoney ! - No , Nelson , don 't do it ! I was taken away from my family when I was nine years old . I went to Stoneham School for Boys . I thought I 'd paid my dues ! It was an accident . Let 's go home , okay ? Dave 's right ... I can still make amends . How ? - Nelson ? - Joe , I 've got to borrow your car . Nelson , wait . My God ! Hello . What ? Where ? Nelson freaked out . Joe and Steckle are stranded . - Will you be all right alone ? - Yeah . Daddy . Rachel . Sweetheart ... I 'm sorry . Forgive me . Billy Mahoney died 17 years ago , and Nelson feels responsible . - Do you know where he went ? - He ran off to make amends . - You think he 'd try to flatline ? - Alone ? That would be suicide . - David ? - No , it 's Nelson . { y : ib } David 's out trying to find you . I wanted to say I was sorry . Please , tell David . - l 'm sorry l got you into this . - No , none of that matters now . Rachel , everything matters . Everything we do matters . - That 's why I 'm going under again . - No , Nelson , wait . - Tell me where you are . - I really am sorry . - It 's payback for our arrogance . - Save it . It 's a good thing I didn 't flatline . I used to tease my fat babysitter . Okay , Billy Mahoney , come on . - Body temperature down to 78 % . - He used potassium ! Joe , electrodes ! 300 . Clear . - Nothing . - We have to go again . Clear . Go up to 360 . Clear ! - I can 't hear anything . - He called . It 's been nine minutes . let 's intubate . I can 't get it in . His trachea 's too tight . Stop , Billy ! - Nothing . - Get me 4mg of atropine ready . - David ... - Atropine intratracheal . - This is a truckload , Dave . - This has got to work . Come on . - Come on , Nelson . - He 's been dead ten minutes . - He 's not in v-fib . - Eppy intracardial . Just do it ! No ! Don 't do it , Billy ! I 'm sorry ! Starting CPR ! Starting CPR ! It 's been 12 minutes ! He is dead . Breathe ! Forget about it . We lost him . Dave , stop it ! Stop , David . David , stop it ! let him go . - We 're all responsible for this . - Maybe we deserve this . No . It 's not fair and it 's not right . I 'm sorry , God ! I 'm sorry we stepped on your fucking territory ! I 'm sorry ! lsn 't that enough ? - Apparently not . - I 'll call the police . I could hear it in his voice on the phone . He felt he deserved to die . Bullshit ! It was a mistake . He was just a little kid . He doesn 't deserve to die ! Come on , Nelson ! - Clear ... - No , wait ! I 've got a pulse . We 've fucking got him ! - Come on , pick up the beat . - Easy , don 't rush him . - Pick up the beat . - Don 't rush him . That 's it . Hail Mary , praise Jesus , and all that stuff . - Hi , don 't try to talk . - I 've got to get this on tape . He said ... He said it wasn 't such a good day to die . Thank you . Thank you .

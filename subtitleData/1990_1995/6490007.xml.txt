 Relax , they 'll be here . The bank 's gonna close in five minutes . - Sure it wasn 't a bogus tip ? - No , it 's real . I 've been on this long enough . I know the difference . Besides , I can feel it . I can feel them . I 'm inside their heads . Just as long as you keep yours ! Message received , Agent Scully . Loud and clear . Position Five , this is Agent Willis . Do you copy ? - What , are you nervous ? - Nope . | just don 't want our luck to run out . Baby , you are my luck . And no matter what happens , ... .. whenever I look up at the stars , ... .. I know you 're gonna be looking up at the same ones . The same ones , baby . You make every day like New Year 's Eve ! Come on , people ! Get down on the floor , now ! Get down on the floor ! ( screaming ) I ain 't messin ' around here ! You ! Down on the floor , now ! Now , or you 're dead ! Everyone ! Down on the floor ! Or I 'll execute every one of you ! Move ! Move ! Put the money in the bag . Now ! Now ! Move it ! - Faster ! - Dupre ! Drop the gun ! FBI ! Drop the gun ! ( Willis ) Now ! ( doctor ) Clear ! Watch him carefully . 11 minutes , 55 seconds . Clear ! Come on , Jack . ( doctor ) He 's been flatlined for 12 minutes . Another amp of epi , and we 'll go again at 360 . Clear ! ( nurse ) Still no pulse . We 've done all we can . I 'm sorry . ( doctor ) All right , let 's call off . - You want me to pronounce ? - No ! You can 't give up on him . - It 's been over 13 minutes . He 's dead . - Go up to 400 . We lost him . Let him go . I 'm a doctor ! Go up to 400 , or I 'll do it myself ! Clear ! ( nurse ) Still no pulse . Give him another amp of epi intracardial and go up to 400 again . Do it ! Clear ! Again ! - Come on , Jack . - Clear ! ( Scully ) Come on ! We got a rhythm . Don 't ask me how , but he 's back ! BP 's 80 over 50 and climbing . 90 over 50 . ( machine beeping ) Hello , Mr Goldbaum . How are we doing tonight ? I 'm just going to adjust your drip . I 'll check on you again later . ( door shuts ) ( gunshot ) ( Willis cuts ) Any word from Willis ? Still missing . He hasn 't been home or to the office . I heard something about a mutilation ... Yeah . Three fingers on Dupre 's left hand were severed by surgical shears . We lifted prints . They 're Willis 's . He said he was chasing this guy for almost a year ? He lived the case . It was all he ever thought about . What are you thinking ? That maybe this is some kind of post-trauma psychosis . Like the way soldiers sometimes mutilate the body of a dead enemy . That still doesn 't explain why he would just vanish . Dupre 's partner ... Who was she ? ( Mulder ) Lula Phillips . They met while she was serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter in Maryland . - He was a prison guard . - Until the warden found out their secret . According to Lula 's cell mate , they carried on quite a torrid romance . It says here she was released on May 2nd , 1993 . One week before the first robbery at Annapolis Savings and Loan . A 65-year-old female teller was pistol-whipped . Died from a massive subdural haemorrhage . She didn 't put the money in the bag fast enough ! - Lovely couple ! - Well , apparently they took turns . One pulling ajob , while the other one drove getaway . Between the two of them they 've killed seven people and got away with close to $ 100,000 . That 's a lot of money , now that she doesn 't have to split it . Well , we 're putting her face out there . Local newspapers , America 's Most Wanted ... Am I boring you ? - They were married . - Yeah , last May in Atlantic City . So what ? So I don 't think this was a simple necrophiliac mutilation . Willis sliced and diced those fingers to get at the wedding ring . Anybody here ? Lula ? ( plane flies overhead ) ( whispers ) Baby , baby , baby ... Damn ! ( Scully ) It 's a left thumb print . Look at these two bifurcations here . Whoever was holding that cleaver used his left hand . - " Whoever " ? It was Willis . - Willis is right-handed . I checked his pistol grip at the armoury . But the bank surveillance tapes show Dupre is left-handed . I 'm not sure where you 're going with this . How long did Willis flatline before you revived him ? Just over 13 minutes . This EKG strip recorded his cardiac activity at the time . In your medical opinion , what does that look like ? It could be anything . Instrument malfunction , electrical overload ... But what does it look like ? Two heartbeats . Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest at the exact same time , right ? Right ... For a period of minutes , both men were technically dead . - Technically . But we resuscitated Willis . - You resuscitated his body . Mulder ... Two men died in that crash room , Scully . One man came back . The question is , ... .. which one ? What can you tell me about near-death experiences , Agent Scully ? The usual stuff . The tunnel , the light , people rising up and viewing their own bodies . As a scientist , how do you account for the phenomenon ? Some sort of dissociative hallucinatory activity . Hm . Half of all the adults who have had a near-death experience cannot wear a watch . The increased electrical activity in their bodies renders the watches inoperable . I know this sounds kooky , but , as any biologist will tell you , ... .. when cells die and genetic material begins to unfold , ... .. a tremendous charge of energy is released . Doctor Varnes believes this is responsible ... .. for the transformational nature of the experience . People do return from the event profoundly changed . Changed how ? Personality shifts , perceived psychic abilities , increased zest for life . What about the negative consequences ? They 're rare . But in the process of dying ... .. there is a time during which the body is vulnerable . - I don 't understand . - Well , ... .. there was a pilot in my support group who died in a commuter plane crash , ... .. along with his three passengers . This was a few years ago . Now , he recalls floating up ... .. in a brilliant aura of light , and then feeling an ovenivhelming need to return to his body . He was revived in the ambulance on the way to the hospital . The only survivor . Soon after that , the visions started . Visions of making love to his wife , in ways that weren 't in his memory . Turns out that one of the dead passengers on the plane was having an affair with his wife . The dead passenger 's memory , his ... .. his consciousness , had survived through the pilot . - What happened ? - The pilot became increasingly disoriented . Schizophrenic , his doctor claims . He strangled his wife with an extension cord . That 's a nice story ! I don 't discount the near-death experience . It can be explained empirically , ... - .. by stimulation of the temporal lobe . - I sense a big " but " coming ! I still believe that Jack 's disappearance can be explained in psychological terms . For instance ? The stress of the case , the trauma of being shot , Jack 's personality ... - How well do you know him ? - We dated . For almost a year . He was my instructor at the Academy . The plot thickens ! We even had the same birthday . We used to celebrate in some dive in Stafford that had a slanted pool table . But it was always so hard for Jack to ... .. relax . It was impossible for him , really . He was always so ... intense , so relentlessly determined . Do you believe he 's predisposed to this type of psychotic episode ? It 's a long way from saying Jack had a near-death experience ... .. to saying his body 's been inhabited by Warren Dupre . A long way ! What the hell ... ? ! - You 're such a creature of habit , Tommy . - Who the hell are you ? - Get outta bed . - I ain 't got no clothes on . Get outta bed ! I don 't wanna shoot you lying down . Who are you - the rent man ? Cos I 'm all paid up . I swear . I 'm not kiddin ' . - Come on , you can go ask Cosmo . - Shut up ! - Where is she ? - Where 's who ? - Your sister . - Huh ! Lula ? Look , I don 't know . I don 't know , I swear ! I was just waiting to see her on the news . What 'd | tell you ? Check it out . ( sound off ) The sound 's busted . Looks like they 're gonna find her before you do , pal ! Is that what you think ? It 's not what I think . I miss her , Tommy . I miss her so bad ! That 's why I came back . - Do I know you from somewhere ? - Everything I see , ... .. I see her . Jesus , man ! You 're bleeding . Even ugliness is beautiful ... because of her . - OK , what are you doing ? - You set us up , Tommy . You sold us out to the FBI ! Dupre ? ( gunshot ) Neighbours heard a gunshot , but nobody checked it out . Patrol guys responded this morning to an anonymous 911 and found him here . Except the rats found him first . The victim 's name was Thomas Phillips . That 's Lula 's brother . There 's not a lot of family resemblance left , between the rats and the .45 in the face ! - ( Bruskin ) Oh , I hate this nicotine stuff . - ( Scully ) What 's the story ? Oh , he 's single . He 's lived here alone for the past seven months . A few priors - small stuff , mostly . B and E , narcotics possession . Nothing like his big sister . - Was the TV on when they found him ? - No . Why ? I don 't think Tommy was much of a reader , since he doesn 't have any books . From the position of the body , I 'd say maybe he was watching the tube when he was shot . - Print kit 's over there . Knock yourself out ! - ( Willis ) Get out of my way , Ace ! Regulations state , to gain access to a crime scene , you gotta show lD ! Looks like you were right . Excuse me . ( Scully ) Jack ... ( gunshots ) Is there a problem here ? No , ljust , uh ... ldon 't have any lD . Would you tell this gentleman who I am ? Officer , this is Agent Jack Willis . Violent Crimes Section of the Washington Bureau . Come on , let 's talk out here . ( ofﬁcer ) lwasjust doing myjob , miss ! Willis , what happened ? ! Half the Bureau 's been looking for you . Where have you been ? I don 't know. ljust ... wasn 't myself . ljust kinda ... woke up out on the street ! - I 'm taking you back to the hospital . - No way ! I 'm staying right here ! - You 're not ready to be here . - Who says ? ! Jack , you 're recovering from a major trauma . It 's a miracle you 're even able to walk ! - This is Tommy Phillips ' place , right ? - Jack ... Was he killed with a .45 ? As a matter of fact , he was . He was ! That 's Lula 's weapon of choice . I know these people . I 've been after them for a long time . We 're halfway there ! - You did open the book on this one . - And I 'll be there when it 's closed ! All right . But , as a colleague and as a friend , ... .. I recommend you have a full medical evaluation . Physical and psychological . All right , fair enough . Jack ! Good to see you back among the living . - It 's good to be back . - Jack . - So what have we got here ? - Mulder here found a print on the TV . A partial oblique . And it 's not the victim 's . Good work , Agent Mulder . I 'm impressed ! ( gunﬁre ) That 's fancy shooting . I gotta get re-certified before they give me my weapon back . Well , by the looks of it , lwouldn 't worry about re-certification . - Is there anything else you wanted ? - Yeah , it 's Scully 's birthday . I was wondering if you 'd sign that for me . Sure ! Be glad to . Always glad to celebrate the good times . There you go ! ( Mulder ) Happy birthday , Scully . You 're two months early . It 's from Willis . I thought you two had the same birthday ? - We do . - Well , that 's news to him . | asked him to sign it . And he signed it with his left hand . You tested him . Yeah . I found out evidence from the Phillips murder is missing . - What evidence ? - The print we lifted . Our best lead is gone . Someone stole it before the lab had a chance to take a look at it . - And you think Willis is responsible ? - I 'm not sure Willis is Willis . Can you at least accept the possibility ... .. that , during his near-death experience , psychic transference occurred ? Can 't you accept the possibility that this isn 't an X-File ? ! Aside from the expected level of post-trau ma stress , . .. .. Jack passed both of his evaluations - physical and psychological . Just because someone forgets a birthday , it doesn 't mean that he 's been possessed ! When I was studying for my medical boards , I forgot my birthday , too ! Did you forget how to sign your name ? This is a copy of the automobile requisition form Willis filed the day before he was shot . Compare the signatures . Like I said , Mulder - stress . All right ? It can significantly affect someone 's cursive standard . I 'm afraid this doesn 't prove a thing . ( phone rings ) Agent Willis here . ( Scully ) Jack ? - Where are you going ? - We got a break ! - A landlord thinks he 's got our girl . - Hotline ? Yeah . Saw her picture in the post office . There 's the address . - Jack , can I ask you something ? - Yeah , sure . The Phillips murder . The print Mulder lifted off the TV. lt 's missing . And ? And you were carrying the evidence back . Are you implying something , Agent Scully ? I don 't know anything about any missing print . Now , I 'm ten minutes away ... .. from closing the biggest case of my career . Are you coming ? ( Willis ) What 's the apartment number again ? 202 . Oh , yeah . ( man laughing ) - What was this guy 's name ? - Multrevich . - Multrevich ? - ( knocks at door ) All right , all right , all right ! Mr Multrevich , I 'm from the FBI . Jack Willis . - We spoke on the phone , right ? - Oh , yeah . Have you ever seen this lady ? Yeah . 207 . Two days ago . First and last month - cash . - Where 's 207 ? - Down the hallway . We want you to go back inside your apartment ... .. and stay away from the windows . Thanks . ( Scully ) Where 's our backup ? You said you called them , right ? Should 've been here ten minutes ago . She may be running down a fire escape ! I 'm gonna call in again . Look ! That 's her ! - Where is she ? Where 'd she go ? ! - I 'll check back here . ( faint noise ) ( generator hums ) ( pipes rattle ) Yeeargghhh ! Face down ! Face down ! Hands behind your back ! - Now ! - ( Lula groans ) ( relieved sigh ) She 's all yours , Jack . Yeah ... Like a dog on a leash . I already cuffed her . They 're for you , Scully . Put ' em on . - What 's going on , Jack ? - Put ' em on . Or I 'll blow you in half . Jack " . ( shouts ) Shut up ! Put ' em on ! Come on , baby . Come on , get up , baby . Look at you ... Your face is all dirty . - Keep your stinking hands off me ! - Baby ! You ain 't gonna believe where I 've been . ( Willis ) Sure it 's crazy . You don 't think I know it 's crazy ? This isn 't my face ! These aren 't my hands ! But it 's me in here ! And I know you . I know everything about you , baby . Come on , ask me something . Your birthday is April 7th . Your favourite colour is red . Come on ... Come on , ask me something else . Come on , ask me ! OK ... OK , what did we do after we got married ? Right after ? - After that . - Well ... we went down to the beach . I took out my buck knife and I sliced open my palm . And then I slit open your palm . And we let the blood drip down in the water . - Then what did you say to me ? - I said ... .. " This is so we can be married in all the oceans of the world . " And then I made you a solemn oath . To never take this ring off my finger . Even And I mean to keep that promise . This is ... This is just too weird ! I can 't believe it 's really you ! Don 't worry , baby . It won 't make any difference in the dark . - ( Bruskin ) We 'll be in touch . - When do I get my reward ? We 'll call you . Now I 'm worried . 12 hours with no word ? I don 't get it . Why 's her car still sitting out front ? Why didn 't Willis call for backup ? Because it wasn 't Willis who answered the hotline . - You heard the recording . It was his voice . - Forget it , Bruskin . Plus which ... the manager just lD 'd him and Scully . I said , forget it , Bruskin ! This isn 't one of your X-File theories , is it ? It doesn 't matter what I think . We 're still after the same thing . ( phone rings ) - Mulder . - FBI centrex operator . Please hold . - Yeah . - ( Willis ) Guess who , Ace . Willis ? ! That depends on who you ask , don 't it ? Where 's Scully ? ( snorts ) You 're the FBI ! You figure it out ! Let me talk to her . Yeah , sure . - Mulder ... - Dana , are you OK ? - Don 't ... - Dana ? OK ! That 's it ! Goodbye ! It 's not gonna work , Jack . You don 't think so ? Bureau policy prohibits negotiating with kidnappers . But you already know that , don 't you , Jack ? Stop calling me that ! Your name is Jack Willis . You were born February 23 , 1957 . - You live at 51 Stanhope ... - My name is Warren James Dupre ! And lwas born in Clammouth Falls , Oregon , in the Year of the Rat ! We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens . You taught me how to fish through the ice . It was your parents ' cabin . Jack , try to remember . We drove up in a snowstorm . Come on , Jack ! Don 't think I didn 't see what you did ! I was like a little slip of paper , up there on that hospital ceiling . - I saw everything . - What did you see ? You left me to die on that table , while you tried to save your friend ! - You are my friend ! - Too bad he was gone already . I watched him go . Just saw him slip away down that long , black tunnel . No . We brought you back . You shot me dead ! And then you let me die . No . You won 't kill me , Jack . You call me that one more time , ... .. and I 'll make you stone cold . Easy , baby . Easy ! Not yet . Remember , she 's our ticket . Hey ! - Got any more of this soda ? - You just drank the last of it . Soda ... ? How much of that have you had ? - What 's it to you ? - Jack Willis is diabetic . Which means that you are . Too much sugar in the system could lead to hyperglycaemia . Maybe that 's why your stomach 's hurting so bad . Abdominal pain is the first sign of impending diabetic coma . You need insulin . ( Willis ) I feel myself getting into their heads , and I 'm scared by what I 'm feeling . The intoxicating freedom that comes from disconnecting action and consequence . Theirs is a world where nothing matters but their own needs , ... .. their own impossible appetites . And while the pleasure they derive from acts of violence is clearly sexual ... .. it also speaks to what Warden Jackson called their " operatic devotion to each other " . It 's a love affair ... I almost envy . ( tape stops ) Cadenceville PD just reported a drugstore was broken into here , ... .. on the corner of Old Forge Road and Madison . I 'm betting that Scully is somewhere within this five-mile radius . - Am I missing something ? ! - 200 units of NPH insulin were taken . Willis is diabetic . Get me a census report . Let 's see how many households we 're talking about . ( weakly ) Quick , quick , quick ! My legs are starting to go numb ! Hold on ... - What the hell ... ? - Drop the needle . - Without this medicine , he dies . - Yeah ! So you said . Now ... put it down . Unless you want me to put you down with it . What the hell are you doing ? I need that medicine ! - You still haven 't figured it out , have you ? - Figured what out ? It wasn 't my brother who set you up ! You ? ! Yeah ... Me . How do you think I got away so clean ? The minute you stepped into that bank , I was out of there . I got the money and I got rid of you ! At least , I thought I did . Agh ... ( phone rings ) Tactical room . This is it ! Mulder . - ( Lula ) Listen carefully . - Where 's Willis ? - Oh , he 's here somewhere . - Let me talk to Scully . Not this time . We don 't deal unless we know Scully 's alive . She 's alive . She 's not happy , but ... she 's alive . You listen to me . You lay one hand on Scully , and so help me God ... If I were you , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . Cos if you ever wanna see Scully again , it 's gonna cost you a million dollars . Have it by this time tomorrow . I 'll tell you when and where . We got it . It 's a 202 number . - ( Bruskin ) Great ! - ( Mulder ) It 's coming through . - Here it is . - Get the address . - Forget it . - Why ? It 's Scully 's cellular number . They 're using her phone . We can 't trace them . ( Lula on phone ) She 's not happy , but ... she 's alive . If I were you , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . - That last part ? - Yeah . Squelch the voice even more . Yeah . Done . If I were you , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . Yep . Yep ! There 's something there . Definitely something at the high end . Let me throw on an extra Z-14 filter ... and isolate everything over half a decibel . If I were you , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . There . That engine sound . Let 's clean it up some more ! - If I were you , I 'd stop talking and ... - ( engine sound ) Is that a small plane ? Taking off , by the sound of it . Give me a minute to guess the altitude within 200ft ! Great ! All right , people ! Settle down , grab a seat . Mulder says he 's got something . What ? An alien virus , or new information on the Kennedy assassination ? Hey , Mulder 's all right . Pay attention , you might learn something from the man . From our last phone contact , we 've identified what sounds like light aircraft . Now , Washington County Regional Airport happens to fall within our area . Since takeoffs are north to south , ... .. it 's a fair bet that our target area lies along this flight path . For those who remember math , that gives us an area of three square miles to cover . Roughly 1,000 households . With 100 law enforcement officials , ... .. at about 30 households per man per hour , we can canvass the entire area in three hours . Bruskin will grid the target area and divide it among the teams . For those of you ... who don 't know already , this one 's important to me . So , um ... let 's do it right . Thanks . Let me see Steinberg , Calder , Westin , Stipley and Mackowitz ... - ( Willis ) Scully ? - Huh ? Was there snow ? Yes ... Jack . There was lots of snow . - I can 't ... - It was December . It was the weekend after Thanksgiving . I remember ... .. a red stove . Yeah ... That 's right . There was a ... There was a wood-burning stove right in the middle of the room . Cold , hm ? - Yeah . - So cold ... I remember ... I had to wrap you in a blanket ... .. when the wood ran out . Yeah . No ... Jack ! Don 't close your eyes . Come on , keep talking . Jack , keep talking ! Come on ! ( Dupre ) Down on the floor , now ! Now , or you 're dead ! - I 'm gonna execute every one of you ! - No ! No ! Shut up and do it ! ( knock at door ) - ( knock at door ) - Just a second ! Who is it ? It 's Brother Tate . Could I speak with you for just one moment , please ? What do you want ? Just a few minutes of your time , ma 'am . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? I wonder if I can interest you in the word of the Lord ? Leather-bound , in black or red . Your choice . Go away ! This is 1-4 . Target sighted . Well ... I guess it 's time to make that call . He 's dead . It 's all on you now . He 's dead because of you . Well ... Guess it 's over . Whoever you are . - Agh ! - Don 't move ! - Jack ! - Shut up ! I love you . Don 't you know ? You 're why I came back . This is Westin . They 've battened down the hatches . No clear shot from this side . What about you guys ? Ditto . Hold your positions and keep radios at two . - How do we look ? - Backup 's in . - But we still don 't know what 's going on . - We will soon enough . I kept a bottle of medicine in the other room . I 'll go get it . What do you say , huh ? I 'll get it for you . Look ! Look ! Look ! Look , I love you . - I love you , baby . - No ... Listen ! Listen , we ... we still have her . We can get away with this . I don 't think so , baby . Not this time . Jack , put the gun down ! You remember that ... that light that I talked about ? - ( whispers ) No ... - It 's beautiful . - There 's nothing to be afraid of . - ( gunshot ) - No ! - fbi ! Freeze ! ( Scully ) Jack ! FBI ! Scully . Are you OK ? Jack ? ! Hi . I got this from the morgue , along with the rest of his personal effects . - I thought you might want it . - Mm . " Happy 35th . Love D. " I got it for him three years ago . Next of kin ? Uh ... no . Jack was an only child . His parents died when he was in college . There 's a ... kid over in Parklawn . Jack 's been his big brother , so I 'm going to go and see him tomorrow . - What am I gonna tell him ? - The official story . Which is ? Fugitive Lula Phillips died in a shoot-out with federal agents . It also resulted in the death of Special Agent Jack Willis - killed in the line of duty . What am I supposed to tell myself ? Good night . It 's not working . It stopped . At 6.47 . The exact time that Jack went into cardiac arrest at the hospital . What does that mean ? It means ... It means whatever you want it to mean . Good night . ( child ) I made this !

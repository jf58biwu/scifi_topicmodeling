 [ Reed ] Ah , but , dear , be reasonable . What if some intergalactic adversary attacks while we 're ... Even the Fantastic Four need a vacation . You are not putting it off again by absent-mindedly losing our luggage . Can 't someone else save the world this month ? You mean , just let the Avengers or Thor get irradiated and pulverized instead of us ? Ever hear the phrase " overly responsible " , Reed Richards ? [ laughs ] Guess the missus is serious about a vacation this year , Stretcho . Dead serious . Did you think Ben and Johnny might need a break too ? All right , I 'll call the airlines , dear . By the way , where are we going ? Ah , wow , I 'm so shocked you agreed that my mind 's a blank . Any ideas , Ben ? Yeah , what say I just let the fickle finger of fate decide , huh ? Ah , yes , I 'll hold . [ laughs ] Just make sure I get three seats across and plenty of honey-roasted peanuts . Hey , grab ya sarong , Suse . We 're heading for a sunny South Pacific piece of paradise called ... Tivu Island . There , Foley . The spire described in the ancient Incan tablets . According to the legends , this stone hand will reveal the ancient alien civilization that once inhabited Tivu Island . I don 't believe it , Doctor Neville . And here I was , thinking you be daft . [ Neville laughs ] Greater minds than yours have called me mad , but here is proof of my sanity . These mechanisms were old when the human race was beginning . I don 't get it , Doctor . What 's the meaning of all this ? What was that ? [ both ] No ! [ robot ] No outsiders are allowed here . - So my supreme masters command . - [ both cry out ] [ Ben ] Sheesh . I was hoping for a plush wide-body with complimentary slippers . [ Reed ] Sorry , Ben . Who 'd have thought all the flights to the South Pacific would be booked ? Gee , I don 't know , Professor . Maybe someone who waited till the last minute . Whoa ! Sure you won 't come , Johnny ? A change of scenery might be what you need to ... Forget about Crystal ? Ha , not a chance . I never wanna forget her , Sis . This Torch is gonna carry that flame forever . [ laughs ] Thanks , anyway . I 'll just hang out here . You guys have a great time , and don 't worry . I 'll keep an eye on the universe . See you later . [ sighs ] Snap out of it , Storm . You gotta stop feeling sorry for yourself . I 'm sure Johnny 's found another girl by now . I only knew him such a short time , but it was so ... magical . Fate 's been kinder to you , Medusa . You and Black Bolt were reunited . Yes , but for how long ? Every day my beloved flies through the city seeking a possible weak spot in the impenetrable Negative Barrier . Every day our air supply diminishes , and it gets harder to breathe . When the oxygen 's depleted , all Inhumans will die . No ! I must finally shatter the barrier and free everyone yet ! [ grunts of exertion ] [ sighs of resignation ] [ Crystal ] No more , Karnak , no more ! You 'll break your hand . Don 't torture yourself , Karnak . We 've tried all we could . The accursed Barrier can repel anything , even my kick . Cousins ! See how clever Maximus is . I have made a metal kite . [ manic laughter ] See how it flies without wings , without a motor . Maximus is like a poor lost child . I feel so sorry for him , Medusa . - But his madness has doomed us all . - [ growling ] Would you like me to make a kite for you , Gorgon , or some other clever ... It 's dissolving the Barrier you should be working on . The Barrier , and the Barrier only ! Save your breath , Gorgon . He cannot , or will not , understand . ... Gorgon is displeased . But come , see what I have done to our cousin Triton . - [ Karnak ] You maniac ! - [ Gorgon ] If you 've harmed him , I 'll ... [ thud ] [ Crystal ] Maximus , no ! You madman ! He 'll die without water ! No , Karnak . See ? I have freed Triton from the confines of his watery prison . - [ Karnak ] What ? - [ gasps ] I can breathe ! [ all gasp ] [ Maximus ] Don 't you see ? The circulators I have created will pump life-giving saline chemicals through his water-breathing body ! Yes , yes ! Now I can live like all of you , breathing the air ! What precious little is left of it . Black Bolt ! Look at what I have done for Triton , dear brother . Black Bolt ! I am no longer slave to the watery depths ! [ laughs ] It was easy for me to do , brother . Now show your regal gratitude by restoring me to the throne again , hmm ? Sorry , I didn 't quite hear you . [ manic giggling ] Quiet , Maximus . You know Black Bolt 's merest whisper would destroy this palace . Oh , yes , I know that . And I know other things , like your useless attempts to break the Barrier . All have failed , and all your poor little subjects will soon die , because only I know how to break free . [ heavy breathing ] No ! Why should all the Inhumans perish because of your madness ? - You will give up your secret . - My loving brother , save me ! - Save your rightful king . - [ sighs ] Forgive me , my King . In my blind rage I did forget that Maximus is truly mad . [ gasps ] They all want to harm me . All of them ! But you 'll always protect poor Maximus , won 't you , my brother ? We 'll never leave Attilan again , but I 'm not afraid , because we 're all together . [ crackling ] Black Bolt summons all Inhumans to the Great Square . While there is still air to breathe . These who now dare intrude will be destroyed by the Vibro Screen . [ buzzing ] [ Ben ] So , kiddies , what do you think of the little hunk of heaven Ol ' Blue Eyes picked out just for you , heh ? - Ben , it 's beautiful . - [ beeping ] Hm , I don 't like the looks of this strange energy flux . You really know how to rain on a picnic , Professor . [ gasps ] What the ... ? We 've hit a vibration field . The plane 's shaking to pieces ! And here I am without trip-cancellation insurance . Susan , use your invisible force field as a buffer ! - Reed , I 'm on vacation ! - But I ... It 's a joke , dear . [ Ben ] It 's working like a charm , Susie , except now I won 't be able to set this baby down on her tail . Reed ! I don 't suppose that 's one of the tourist attractions . [ Reed ] Sue , remove your force field or you 'll hit it ! - Ben , you 're going to ... - Relax , Stretcho . I ain 't gonna nail that 15-foot-high speed bump . [ Reed ] Throw me in front of the plane ! - Have you flipped your big brain ? - Just do it ! [ Reed groans ] [ crash ] [ Ben ] Emergency exit , Suse ! [ robot ] I am intergalactic Kree Sentry 4-5-9 . I cannot be deterred from my purpose . I am Sentry . [ both cry out ] For millennia , my unchanging orders have been to protect this base from invaders like you . I 'm not trying to harm you . I 'm trying to protect my friends ! This alien world has spawned strange new beings since my last awakening . Give it a rest , Stretcho . It 's robot clobberin ' time ! I am no mere robot . And I ain 't no mere Thing ! Often imitated , never duplicated , and always cheaper by the pound ! [ electrical crackling ] Oh , my aunt Petunia ! Yow ! Oof ! Ouch ! [ splutters , coughs ] [ Sue ] Ben , are you all right ? I was till I stumbled into the Indiana Jones ride at Tivu Disneyland ! Hmph . Looks like these two holidayers want their shekels back . Fascinating . They 've been imprisoned in a shimmering mass of colloidal atoms . Wait ! Sorry , Stretcho , I can only take so many big words . Oomph ! Run ! A big broth of a robot is guarding this cursed place ! Easy , pal . I knocked that Sentry clown into the next century . All part of the Fantastic Four 's new robot-bashin ' service . [ gasps , murmurs ] Why has Black Bolt gathered us together , Medusa ? Do you think he finally found a way to destroy the Barrier ? [ whooshing ] [ murmuring ] [ electrical crackling ] He points to the shelters deep beneath the city . We must go there at once . [ Crystal ] But why , Medusa ? What does Black Bolt plan to do ? We shall all know very soon , my sister . Now , to the shelters ! The moment of truth has finally come . [ electrical crackling , sound of flying ] Please don 't do it . I 'm afraid ! I know you think me insane because I created this Barrier that traps us , but I 'm not mad ! [ sobs ] My plan was sanity itself : when you failed to free your people , they would have returned my rightful crown to me . But I never thought you would ... speak . - Don 't do it ! Please ! Please ! - [ electrical crackling ] [ roars ] [ Maximus ] You set them free . Now they 'll love you forever . I 'll never be king again ! Oh , no , no , no , no , no ! [ sobs ] [ thudding footsteps ] [ breathes deeply ] Breathe deep the air , my cousins . King Black Bolt has given the Inhumans back their lives , and their freedom . But at such a cost : beautiful Attilan ... gone . We have sacrificed a city to gain a world . Oh , Triton . Then maybe some day I might see my Johnny again . But there is so much to be done here first . [ electrical crackling ] [ Medusa ] Black Bolt . Really ? Good ol ' Sis sure picked a primo time for a vacation . I 've never seen this burg so dead . I knew it was too boring to last . Looks like some yahoo 's breaking and entering at our place . A little action should do me some good . Come on out where I can see you , or you 'd better be fireproof . J - Johnny ? Crystal ? Wow , I must be seeing things ! You ... It seems like a dream to me too , Johnny , but it 's very real . Crystal , I have missed you so m ... - But how ? - Black Bolt freed us . [ sighs ] But our home was destroyed . I must return soon for the rebuilding . But Black Bolt allowed me to see you first . Oh , Crystal , there 's so much I want to say to you , so many things I want you to know ... I already do , my Johnny Storm . - [ barking ] - Yuck ! What 's he doing here ? [ laughs ] How do you think I got here , silly ? Just promise me you won 't zap her back home for a while , okay ? Phew , we gotta do something about that breath . ... the intergalactic Kree the Seeker told me about obviously left a robot Sentry to guard this space port until their return . So my arrival obviously activated his energy sensors ... [ yawns ] Some vacation , huh , Suse ? Now that Stretcho 's found another egghead to yammer with , peace and quiet 's taken the first raft out of here . [ sighs ] Yes , and unfortunately , we weren 't on it . There ! With the vibration device deactivated , you and your guide are now free to go . [ laughs ] And not a minute too soon for Mr. Foley . Oh , I hope to return some day with a more scientific team . Ah , perhaps , Dr. Richards , you would like ... - Why , I 'd ... - Sorry , Doc , he 's otherwise engaged . Pick us up next week and I 'll get you an appointment . He 's all yours , Suse . Forgive me if I don 't oil your backs . [ grunts ] Ha . You ain 't lost your touch , Benjy boy . - Oof ! - [ heavy footsteps ] [ Sentry ] I bear you no malice . Just think of the technological marvels that ancient space port might hold . [ sighs ] I guess a bikini doesn 't stand a chance with you . - [ Reed ] Huh ? - [ splash ] When is Ben gonna learn to skip boulders more quietly ? Oh , no ! Oh , no , Ben ! Though you have shattered my instrumentation , I have increased my strength until I alone am master . Even force fields shatter before my power . [ Sue ] He 's too strong ! [ Sentry ] I bear you no malice . I do only as I was programmed to do . [ splutters ] [ Reed ] Call Johnny from the Pogo Plane . Tell him I need the ionic destabilizer . If he uses the one-man missile , he might just get here in time . - But , Reed , what about you ? - Vacation 's over ! [ Sentry growls ] [ splutters ] Johnny , come in . We 're on Tivu Island , in terrible danger ! Johnny , please , are you there ? Johnny ! [ giggles ] So is this what you humans call an international dinner , Johnny ? Oh , yeah , to the max ! Polish kielbasa on a French roll with Russian dressing and German sauerkraut , and smothered in ketchup from the good ol ' US of A. - [ growls ] - [ whimpers ] Aaah ... No , don 't tell me . You want a Polish dog too ? [ laughs ] - [ barks ] - Hey , what gives ? - [ Ben splutters ] - I couldn 't raise Johnny . Reed , look out ! I am a Sentry . I only obey orders . It does not matter whether I can see my victims . My force will create a tidal wave which will wash the island clean of all intruders . - My force field ... - We 'll never withstand the impact ! [ groans ] What a time to come to ! What the ... ? - [ Johnny ] Flame on ! - I 'll try and hold the wave back . I 've got a little moat to dig . - [ Sue ] Johnny , hurry ! - [ Crystal ] My wind power is fading . Let me guess . You 're the overachiever who cooked up that tidal wave . - [ Sentry ] You are an intruder . - Ooph ! No ! I 'll save you , Johnny . Whoa , thanks for the help , Crys . You sure recycled that tin can . - [ Johnny ] No ! - [ Crystal ] Johnny ! - [ Crystal groans ] - [ Johnny ] I can 't ... Love conquers all , junior , with a little help from your friends . [ Reed ] Careful . Your powers are causing seismic tremors that could rupture the volcanic plate beneath Tivu . It 's easier to start than stop ! [ Ben ] Oh , Jeez . Too late , lady , it 's lava time ! There 's no way off the island before it blows ! Yes , there is . Lockjaw ! [ Ben ] Oof ! Hey , watch it , you meat hound ! For the first time in all history , a Sentry has failed . Though I have not heard from my Kree masters for untold ages , I remain at my post , as a Sentry must , until the end . This is Sentry 4-5-9 making his final report . I 've made up the spare room , Crystal . How long before you ... ? Just long enough to be with Johnny while he shows me the wonders of his ... - Your world . - [ Johnny ] Come on , Crys . We 've got a little lost time to make up for . Oh , Black Bolt asked me to give you this message : " You were right . Inhumans and humans need not , cannot , live apart forever . " It was meant that all races should co-exist peacefully on this planet . " Johnny and I are proof of that . - [ Sue ] Aw , darling , isn 't it romantic ? - Uh-huh .. Ah , you know , I was wondering how Black Bolt will lead the Inhumans into ... Sometimes a lady just has to take charge . [ laughs ] [ Ben ] Yeah , this is so charming , 'cept I gotta walk this mutant mutt . Hang on , drool-bag . Next stop , Central Park . Something tells me that 's going to be no ordinary walk in the park . Lockjaw ! Whoa ! Stop ! Hold it ! Heel ! Sit ! Reed ! How do you stop this crazy thing ?

 Hi . I 'm beautiful , rich , and lonely and I 'll give you one million game tokens if you 'll spend the night with me . Who 's buying breakfast ? MAN : You see the still-throbbing heart being lifted out of the rib cage and held in the surgeon 's hand . - So who is she ? - Who ? You 're starting at ceilings and grinning like an idiot . - Who is she ? - Lisa . - What else is new ? - Love . I finally realized that I 'm in love with her . Our Lisa ? You can 't be in love with Lisa . - Why not ? - You know the rules . - Put her out of your horny , little mind . - I can 't . That 's the problem . I have to tell her how I feel and I 'll need your help . Okay , when you 're ready to call Lisa up hit this button . I hope you 're prepared for rejection . As always but she 's got to know that I love her . Now am-scray . If I 'm going to go down in flames I want to do it solo . - Good luck . - Thanks . - Hi . - Hi . - Where 's Wyatt ? - Just the two of us this time , you and me all by our little selves . Tonight 's a special night , you know . Special night ? ( Scratching ) ( Soft Music Playing ) Mm , Gary , what exactly did you have in mind ? Lisa , you know I 'm a romantic guy , right ? And when I say these words you know I mean them with all my heart . - I want to do you . - Oh , that 's very sweet , but you know that can 't happen . - Because ? - Because you encoded me with strong moral values , remember ? Actually , that was Wyatt 's dumb idea . The Wyatt part of me can 't grant that wish . I think I found a way around this problem . My wish isn 't for me . It 's for you . - Me ? - I wish that you would fall in love with the best-looking guy in this room . Say , Gar ... I love you . I 've always loved you . Now how about a nice , hard , wet one ? Mmm ... Break it up . Don 't make me get the hose . Nice timing . Don 't you ever knock ? Gary , why did you stop me ? I love him so much . Those lips , his smile ... that button fly . You , take a cold shower . You , come with me . - I can 't feel my tongue . - Wyatt , snap out of it . - We 're in big trouble . - She was all over me . - Did you see it ? - I saw it . She 's in love with you . Completely , totally in love . I knew it . All this time I thought I was kidding myself but she does love me . I wished for her to fall for the best-looking guy in the room . - that means ... - Yeah , she 's in serious need of glasses . Oh , Wyatt , I want you so bad . - Did you hear that ? - You poor guy . I fear for you . - She 's uncontrollable insatiable . - And that 's bad thing ? Do you want what Lisa would do If I wasn 't here to stop her ? She would throw you on the floor and have her way with you repeatedly , non-stop over and over until something snaps . - I 'm guessing you . - Over and over ? Over and over . - Hey , where are you going ? - I 'm taking Lisa to my place . You two have to stay as far away from each other as possible- - At least until the spell 's over . What kind of friend would I be if I didn 't keep Lisa - from having wild sex with you ? - Wait ! Can I just give him one good-bye kiss ? She is in love with me . All right , fine . You can blow him a kiss . Geez , you look tired . You owe me big time . I 've been up all night with Lisa . You don 't know how hard that is . The woman can vaporize through a keyhole travel through telephone lines at the speed of light . - How did you stop her ? - Oddly enough , she 's mesmerized by Barney 's videos . Continuing with our systems of the human animal let 's move on to what some might consider the backbone of the series- - The skeletal system . The bones of the skeletal system vary in size and shape from the femur the longest bone in the body to the hammer , anvil , and stirrup ... Wyatt , you have something you 'd like to share with the class ? Uh , no , sir . I 'm just passing notes here with ... Gary . That 's all , just passing notes with Gary . Let 's see what 's so important that Gary had to ignore my lecture that he might commit his deep thoughts to paper . " Wyatt , my love I dream of lying down together in a pool of honey ... " I didn 't write that . Not my note , no sir . Comforting to know . All right , who wrote this ? I did . " ... licking the sweet nectar off each other 's bodies till the end of time . " Now , that 's a note . Let me out to the proverbial chase here . We don 't allow civilians to consort with Farber students . So if you 'll agree to leave campus I 'll let Mr. Donnelly return to class . I won 't go . Wyatt and I are meant to be together . - End of story . - Lisa ! You leave me no other choice but to call Wyatt 's father . Mr. Donnelly ? Principal Scampi here . My favorite bathing song . # I soak in my hot tub I sweat like a pig # # If I stay in there too long I 'll prune like a fig . # Yes , that 's why I called . Have a nice day . I 'll be straight with you , Wyatt . Your father sounded rather upset . - You want to go skiing in the Alps ? - I have three more classes . - Your classes go away . - No . How can I make this clear ? As much as I would like to ... you know ? You , me together ... - Over and over and over . - Okay . Let 's do it . Oh , geez ! No ! I can 't do this ! You 're not really in love with me . It 's just a spell . I 'd be taking advantage of you . I mean , sure , the sex would be unbelievable and sure , I could probably erase your memory files the morning after , And ... This is driving me crazy ! You got to leave me alone . Are you breaking up with me ? I just think we should spend some time apart for a while until you 're back to being you . Wy ? You on throne patrol ? Wy ? - Wyatt 's not here . - Lis , you gave me quite a shocker . - Where 's the man ? - Gone . It 's just you and me ... - alone . - Really ? - What about Wyatt ? - He broke up with me . - What a feeb . - It 's okay . I don 't know what I saw in him anyway . Sure , he 's cute but he doesn 't have your fire your hot ... manly bod . You look a little tense . Sit down , I 'll rub you . Three of my favorite words . Ooh , you have really supple shoulders . - Like a spider monkey . - Yeah ? Cool . - Most chicks don 't dig skinny dudes . - Not me . I love skinny . Skinny arms , skinny legs ... - Skinny necks ? - Especially skinny necks . A guy like you could wrap himself around me like a belt of he wanted to . - You 're coming on to me . - Am I that obvious ? A woman can never be too obvious . Cinch me , baby . Oh , Mama ! Guys . Sorry you have to find out this way but Lisa 's come to her senses . She 's dumping you . She wants to bed down with me . Are you okay with this- - me being in love with Gary and not with you ? I guess ... but do you have to use my room ? Oh , don 't worry about being gentle . Damn darm damn . What , am I going too fast ? Should I keep my pants on ? Wyatt doesn 't love me , I thought I could make him jealous . But it didn 't work . You mean , you came on to me to make Wyatt jealous ? Yes . Then you 're not turned on but my ... hot , manly bod ? - We-we could turn the lights off . - ( Sobbing ) ( Bell Ringing ) - Hey , Wyatt . - Oh , hey , Kim . If you still want to swap notes from Lang 's class I could bring mine over to your house tonight . That sounds great . - Wyatt ? - Lisa , what ... ? Hi , honey . - Who 's your friend ? - Um ... this is Kim . - Kim , Lisa . - Nice to meet you , Kim . Kim ? Lisa , what did you do ? She was coming on you . I couldn 't have that , so I made her go away . - Lisa , Lisa , this is bad , very bad . - What 's bad ? A little problem . Uh , Kim Morris ? Lisa kind of , uh , zapped her ... - away . - Away ? Where ? You 're standing with her . Ooh ! That 's got to hurt . Lisa , you can 't just ... From now on , my love nothing 's going to come between us . I 'll make everyone go away if I have to until you belong to me . Could you detach me , please ? Come away with me , Wyatt . Martinique is so lovely this time of year . No ! I don 't mean " No " in a negative sense . I mean , uh ... I have an even better idea . How about we go to , uh ... my room ? - It 's also lovely this time to year . - Mmm ... I like it . The lights down low . I can put on my little Black Teddy . Hurry home , darling . Nice snow job , darling . Now get me down ! What are we going to do ? She 's crazy about me . I don 't see the two of you going to the prom any time soon . We got to shut her down . Turn her off before she toasts any more study-buddles . Okay , her 's the plan : you distract her , but keep your pants on . I 'll unplug the computer . I 'll do my best but I can 't promise on the pants thing . I hear ya . ( Moaning ) ( Both Whimpering ) Oh , darling , what kept you so long ? And why is he here ? I want to be alone with you . Be strong . ( Door Opening ) Whoa ! What reeks ? Well , well , well . Looks like Wyatt 's having a little pajama party . Hey , Mom , guess what . Wyatt brought home a hooker . Real pricey-looking wench too . How many box tops she set you back , Slim Jim ? I 'm sorry . You 're ... ? $ 100 an hour , I 'm guessing . - Do you run a family discount ? - Chett , none of that talk . Would someone explain what 's going on here ? - No . - No . I 'm Lisa , Wyatt 's lover . And we 'd like to spend our lives together alone . Do you have a problem with that . Yes , I have a problem with that . ( Laughs Nervously ) Hey , you 're no ordinary hooker . Nice try , Gary . Did you think I was going for the computer ? No . I was ... I was ... my mind was blank . - It 's time to go , Wyatt . - Oh . Well , uh ... have a good trip . Gary ? Mom ? They 're not here . It 's just you and me , Wyatt , in paradise . We have our own private beach our own Secluded Cabana and three pizza huts . Have I made you happy ? How can I be when you 're vaporized my best friend - and half my family ? - Don 't you see , honey ? They had to go away . They were obstacles to our love . Lisa , you got to bring them back . Please . Okay , just one . Gary ! You 're back ! I 'm back ! I 'm back ! Where are we ? Why are there so many pizza huts . I 'll explain later . Gary , she 's still in love with me . What do we do ? We end this now . Lisa , how can I make this clearly ? You don 't really love Wyatt . Oh , yes , I do . My whole reason for being is to love Wyatt . - You don 't even know what love is . - Sure I do . Love is making out on the hood of a dodge viper . Love is getting right to the sex without having to talk first . Love is doing it in your parents bed when they 're at work . Son of the gun . She does know . You idiot ! That 's not love . That 's the stupid , horny , Gary Wallace version of love you programmed into her . Okay , smart guy if you think you know so much about love go ahead , you tell her . I will . Love ... Makes the world go ' round . All you need is love . If you love somebody , set them free . Right . Right . Set them free . That 's it ! See , you don 't really love me . - Of course I do . - No . No , you don 't . Because if you did , you 'd set me free . That 's what real love is . That 's not in the song . I understand . We 're out ! It 's over ! Way to go , man ! Thank God for stupid pop songs . ( Typing ) What are you doing ? I 'm setting my files to self-destruct . COMPUTER : Sequence activated . 60 seconds to self-destruct . Another minute , I 'll be out of your lives . - What ? Why ? - I need to prove my love . You 're the one who said it- - " If you love someone , se them free . " So that 's what I 'm going to do . I 'll never bother you again , Wyatt . We don 't want you to go away . Wyatt was just spouting stupid lyrics . I 'm confused . first you tell me love means setting someone free then you say that 's not love at all . - COMPUTER : 30 Seconds . - I exist to love Wyatt . But since now I don 't know what love is then I have no reason to exist unless one of you can tell me what love really is . Got anything better than making out on a dodge viper ? - All I know is we are a team . - Before you came along , life sucked . Now we have fun . Don 't you see , Lisa ? We want you to stay . With you around , life 's ... - better . - COMPUTER : Ten Seconds . Nine ... - Then maybe that 's love . - Will you stay ? - Yes . - Then it 's offiicial . That 's love . You love us , we love you . All kinds of love in this room . Give us a hug . One . Zero . Self-destruct activated . - Lisa ? - Lisa file erased . We were too late . Now we 've lost her forever . No ! She can 't be just when I finally realize I love her- - And I don 't mean in a filthy sexual way . I mean the real thing . Whatever that is . Now we 'll never see her again . I have a backup file . I knew I could count on you , Wyatt . That 's why I love you . Oh , don 't worry . I don 't mean in an obsessive , zombies , love puppy kind of way . More like a big sister . So the spell 's finally over ? You brought everybody back ? - Of course . - Chett too . But you 'll be happy to know that when I reassembled his atoms I toyed with his body hair gene . You want to know what love is , Wy ? Love is having a backup file . I love you too , Gar . Captioned by Grantman Brown

 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ music playing ] I need some help . I 'm looking for someone . You need some help . Sure , why don 't you step into my office ? It 's right over there . I don 't see any ... Where do you keep the money ? Or am I gonna have to look for it myself ? How dare you speak to me that way ? This is how I dare . What 's that ? Some sort of threat ? No , it 's not a threat . - No threat at all ! - [ slashing ] Whoa ! Now you ought to leave me alone . But it 's too late . You don 't know who you 're dealing with . Lady , please . [ screams ] [ laughs ] You know something ? You haven 't answered my question yet . - Lady ! - Listen to me . Where is Superboy ? - Superboy ? - I want him now ! [ screams ] [ laughs ] I see . Tossed the guy 30 feet , huh ? Yeah , I would say that 's extra-normal . You called the right place , Mister ... Is that S-l-a-s-h ? Yeah , thank you . We 'll get right on it . [ laughs ] Amazons from hell . Sounds like a Russ Meyer movie . Who ? Never mind . That was just some kid telling me he saw a beautiful blonde down on Denker St. who tossed a guy 30 feet , then dropped him off a fire escape . I 've had dates where I wanted to do that . Wait till I tell Clark . He won 't believe it . This woman said she was looking for someone . Who , the guy who sold her the steroids ? No . Superboy . Superboy ? What for ? How should I know ? You don 't think that kid really saw something , do you ? No , just curious . I 'm sure there 's nothing to worry about . - Can I help you ? - Superboy . How can I find him ? You don 't find him . He finds you . - Do you have a problem ? - No , not me . Well , now you do . I want Superboy ! Where is Superboy ? Accidents , crimes . That 's where he shows up . Nice neighborhood . No one twisted your arm . No , but I was curious . Why did you come ? I was worried about Superboy . Worried ? What 's there to worry about ? Clark , it 's a natural thing to do when you have a relationship . Someday you 'll understand . [ kisses ] Excuse me , sir , we 're trying to find someone that called us this morning . Said his last name was ... excuse me . Are you all right ? [ tires screech ] - [ crashing ] - [ siren wailing ] [ man ] Stay back . [ man ] Oh , my God ! [ laughs ] What are you doing ? I 'm gonna get through that line . That 's just a bureau badge . It 's not a press pass . So who 's got time to read ? Are you coming ? [ laughing ] I want Superboy ! You want me ? Here I am . Who are you ? I am Neila . Is that supposed to mean something to me ? It will . I 'm trying to see if you 're worthy . Worthy ? Worthy of what ? Of marrying me . If this is a joke , it isn 't funny . You could have killed someone . I don 't care about them and it 's no joke . I 'm a warrior , an aristocrat of my planet . And it 's time for me to marry . Then why did you come here ? We 're dying . Without wars to fight , our warriors grow old and die before our time . There are no men left ? There 's lots of men , but they 're vendors , artisans . They don 't possess the powers that I have . They 're beneath me . I 've come a long way for you . Do they know me where you come from ? Could I be one of you ? I 'd know if you were . But we are very much alike in another way . We 're both superhumans amongst lesser beings . We have strength . We have powers they couldn 't even imagine . Maybe , but I 'm happy here . Happy ? Look at them . Like little insects . What do their lives mean ? 70 or 80 years of laboring , of eating and sleeping misery and maybe a little happiness and then it just ends for no reason ? They know that , but they go on . - And I learned from them . - You have learned from them . Things like consideration , kindness , humility . Go back home and live among the ones on your own planet . Maybe then you 'll learn what the human part of superhuman means . - Are you all right ? - Uh-huh . I better get you someplace safe . You care so much about them . See how fragile they are . This time I 'm gonna make sure you never come back . No need . What does she want ? The same thing everybody else wants . Thank you . You 're gonna take all day . [ Neila ] I have one more thing to do . What happened to you ? You like it ? You look a little ordinary . Ordinary is apparently what he likes . What who likes ? I don 't think you need to know that . No , lady , that goes around your neck . Hey , yo , whoa . Wait a minute . You owe me some money . Maybe we could make a deal . Maybe . Maybe not . Clark . " And then Superboy forced the hideous creature to dematerialize in a penetrating beam of light . " What do you think ? You do have a flair . But Superboy didn 't have much to do with it . And she wasn 't hideous . Men . All a woman has to do is show some skin and they think she 's beautiful . Come on , Lana . What ? OK , fine . She was beautiful . What 's gonna happen next time ? Next time ? Clark , she had superpowers just like him . How am I supposed to compete with someone like that ? I mean , this woman could fly and lift cars . And I can 't even cook . [ telephone rings ] Hello , Bureau . Are you sure ? Do you know where she is now ? I 'll be right there . Clark . Um ... it was an old flame . I 'm sorry . Washington was exciting , but all anyone ever talked about there was politics . Got so boring after a while . Especially if you want a social life . That 's why I am so excited about being transferred here . Well , if you think this place is gonna improve your social life , you 're gonna be really disappointed , believe me . I know . I 'm sure you do all right . Maybe I will , too , if I find the right person . Let 's go . I 'm starving . [ chattering over police radio ] Hey , stay back . - Officer , what happened ? - Owner got beat up . A robbery ? That would have been a lot easier to explain to his wife . He says a woman beat him up . Hey , excuse me , the woman who did this , was she a blonde in a strange outfit ? Yeah , but she 's a brunette now . Brunette ? Got rid of all that makeup , too . She took a fox stole from me . It must be worth at least a couple of hundred dollars . [ coughing ] Hey , leave the guy alone . Come on . Just another routine day at the Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters . Nine-hundred-fifty-four of ' em left before I can retire . Nine-hundred-fifty-three . Superboy ! The woman in the stole . Where is she ? - She left . - Is Lana here ? Gone to dinner . Lana and the new girl , they went out together . Did they say where they were going ? They could be anywhere in the city . This was a great idea coming up here . The view 's incredible . You 're not afraid of heights , are you ? No , not me . Twenty-five nightclubs , a dozen gyms . You 'll find someone . I wish I could be so sure . But it 's hard to find the right guy , isn 't it ? I demand ... I expect a lot . Maybe too much . Why should I settle for someone who has any less to offer than I do ? You don 't , but sometimes you have to compromise . Do you ? Well , no . The guy I 'm interested in is ... pretty special . I 'm sure he is . What do you think he 's looking for ? I don 't know . Probably the same thing as everyone . Caring , putting the other person ahead of yourself and willing to make a sacrifice for them . Sacrifice ? You know what I mean . I think it 's something else . It 's your helplessness . I 'm not helpless . You 're helpless compared to Superboy . Someone with his powers could snap you in two if you got in their way . You 're her . [ customers clamoring ] [ choking ] You still defending these insects ? And I see you still can 't take no for an answer . It 's your destiny to be with me . It 's my destiny to be here . They matter to you that much ? Well , then hundreds will die , maybe thousands , unless you come with me . [ blows ] [ laughs ] Homes , schools , churches , anything I want . There 's no way you can save them all . Come with me and you will have a wife that is worthy of you . Come with me and I will let them all live . You have to . Innocent people will die . Wait ! I 'll make it easy . Nooooo ! She was willing to die ? To save others ! That 's what we insects do . What 's it gonna be ? [ screams ] Maybe they do have something to teach us . If you 're willing to learn . [ music playing ]

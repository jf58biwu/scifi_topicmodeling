 [ theme music ] ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel . The speed of light . And the desire to help all mankind . He is " Superboy . " [ music continues ] ( Superboy ) I feel guilty . You 've spent a lot of time trying to solve my problem with kryptonite . Kryptonite could solve a lot of our energy problems . If we can make it safe . What makes you think this time is any different ? This time , I got someone who 's up to the job . But , uh ... he 's a little eccentric . Oh , it 's alright . The glass is leaded . [ rock music ] A little eccentric ? Alright , more than a little . The idea is to melt the kryptonite in that kiln back there . And then reduce it until most of it 's radioactive properties are gone . It 's a little complicated . It 's actually quite simple . It 's always simple . Mike Walker . I 'd like for you to meet- - I know who he is , Major . As I was saying , it 's simple . We make the kryptonite inert , inject it into your blood stream and let your body build up an immunity to this stuff . Well , that doesn 't sound so simple . Oh , no , no . It is , it is . See , atoms interacting with atoms linking making logical progressions . It 's like cord progressions in music .. ( Superboy ) Is he alright ? He does that sometimes . But don 't be fooled . That young man is a genius . Started programming computers for us when he was 15 . [ music continues ] No , the kryptonite ! [ explosion ] [ Mike screaming ] Help me ! [ explosion ] [ screaming continues ] [ intense music ] Hey , Vic . I think this is the break you 've been waiting for . Vic ! I 'm way ahead of you , babe . Way ahead . [ beeping ] Lana ? You 're awake . I 've been worried about you . ( Dooley ) Well , you can stop worrying . It 's been two days and he hasn 't shown any delayed effects . Another day and he 'll be able to go home . Where ever that is . What about Walker ? I 've arranged for you to see him . [ melancholic music ] The kryptonite got into his blood stream . His radiation levels have been going up and down . It seems to follow his emotional pattern . - How the- - - How ? Like I said before , there 's always a simple explanation . Kryptonite atoms bonded with my blood cells . I 'm now living breathing kryptonite . There 's gotta be a cure . The doctors are working on one right now . I 'm sure- - They 'll never find one in time . How long can I last this way ? A couple of days , a week ? Mike , we 're trying . The time I spent here helping other people . Never taking time for myself . Never even being myself . I mean all those endless hours and ... I 'm out of time . Mike . If there 's anything I can do . You 've done enough already . [ intense music ] A little to the left . Mmm . Thank you . Step right up . Get a kiss from the " Boy Of Steel " . Only five bucks . All proceeds go to charity . And uh , no guys . I don 't do that . Right , babe ? Absolutely , Superboy . Next . Who the hell do you think you are ? I think the costume speaks for itself . You been sendin these out haven 't you ? Sure did . But for you , it 's free . You 're not Superboy . I 'm getting the police . - I wouldn 't do that . - Get your hands off me ! Oh ! [ indistinct chatter ] [ rock music ] [ zapping ] [ laughing ] [ siren blaring ] Secure all gates . Set up parameters . [ dramatic music ] ( female on radio ) There are " Green-man " sightings all over Capital city . Military and civilian authorities have refused to comment . We didn 't wanna cause a panic . A little late don 't , you think ? Power failure ? What 's wrong ? What 's going on ? I don 't know . Some kind of rhythmic pulse in the power grid . You know what it is ? It 's a bass line . You mean a base line , an electromagnetic disturbance ? No , it 's a bass guitar line . Bass guitar ? [ rock music ] [ Mike laughing ] [ music continues ] - Walker ! - What do you want ? You gotta stop that and come back to the institute with me . For the first time I 'm free to do what I want . I 'm not gonna stop . You 're dying . Well , I hope I die before I get old . Let me help you . Help me . Help me ! You 're the one that made me this way . Walker ! You 've gotta come back with me . You 'll die . That 'll make two of us . [ zapping ] They 're working on a cure for you now . It 's gonna be too late , Superboy . For both of us . [ jeep revving ] That 's right , boys . Here I am . [ explosion ] [ laughing ] No one get 's outta here alive . No one . ( female on radio ) The reign of terror in Capital City continues . As Mike Walker , now calling himself The Kryptonite Kid has proved virtually unstoppable . His one man campaign of random violence has damaged homes stores , and countless vehicles . Before disappearing yet again Walker announced his intention to destroy Superboy . The question remains , where is Superboy ? Major Dooley . It 's me . ( Superboy ) Any progress ? Superboy , we 've done it . We formulated a serum to counteract Walker 's problem . ( Superboy ) Well , That 's great . Do you know where he is ? Not yet . But I know what you 're getting at , and the answer 's no . - Major . - He will kill you . I 'm not letting you go after him again . I-I understand . ( Lana ) Clark . You 're back . ( Lana ) How 's the cold ? Oh , it 's-it 's a lot better . Where have you been ? Down at the police station identifying the con man . He was impersonating Superboy . He must not have been too bright . That 's an understatement . But he does look exactly like him . Exactly ? ( Lana ) Dead ringer . [ dramatic music ] ( Vic ) This is all a big misunderstanding . Uh , hey , you , you , you 're practically a god to me . I didn 't mean anything personal by it . Honest . I don 't have to say anything to you . I got rights . You can 't touch me ! Look , what do you want from me ? Please say somethin ' . I need a favor . You need a favor ? What 's in it for me ? Might save you about 90 days in jail . Might ? I 'll do the best I can . The minute you don 't need me anymore , I 'm right back here . You 're gonna have to trust me , Vic . I never trusted anybody in my life . You wanna know something ? I ain 't never been wrong . And look where you ended up . Wait . - What do you need ? - A lot . But first I need to know if I can trust you . Absolutely . [ intense music ] [ zapping ] [ zapping continues ] Whatever happened to a good old drum solo ? [ zapping ] You didn 't think I was gonna do it , did you ? [ laughing ] Next time . Unless I see Superboy real soon . Get outta here ! Nice fit . The military has good tailors . Bet it ain 't hard to be a hero wearing ' this costume . You don 't need it to be a hero . Yeah ? Well , you 'll never make me one . See , I 'm not the guy bullets bounce off of . They don 't bounce off for most people . Doesn 't stop them from being heroes . - You mean idiots . - No . I mean ordinary people who risk their lives to help others . Like I said , idiots . No . Firemen , policemen , soldiers . Even people like you . They 're the real heroes . Because they have so much more at stake . You are clueless . They 're getting paid for that . That 's why they do it . ( male # 1 ) Excuses me , Superboy . - Yes , Major ? - We 're ready . We 'll be right there . - You ready ? - Yeah , sure . The gum ? Remember to put it in the trash . [ intense music ] Walker ! Come out ! [ music continues ] The gum , the gum . We 're going back to the base . They have a cure for you . Don 't make me come after you . [ explosion ] [ rock music ] You rang ? One way or the other , this ends here . [ laughing ] Don 't you feel it ? No . They cured me at the base . And they can cure you too . You 're lying . Hey , Superboy never lies . [ zapping ] [ engine revving ] [ zapping ] [ engine revving ] [ zapping ] [ tires screeching ] [ screeching continues ] See . All my powers are still working . Why don 't you let the doctors help you ? I 'm like this because of you . Why should I trust you ? Why should I trust anyone ? Because , because if you spend your whole life not trusting anybody , you end up like .. ... like you . Green ? No . Out on a limb with nobody to pull you back . Look man , you 're dyin ' . I 'm your only hope . Why don 't you let me help you , okay ? I knew it ! You 're not Superboy and there 's no cure for him there 's no cure for me . [ zapping ] Well , I guess you 're gonna die before you get old too . Huh , Superboy ? Die ! Die ! Where 's that lead sheeting ? He 'll kill you . You can 't . Watch me . Die ! [ zapping ] Let 's go . You came back . I guess I 'm one of those idiots , huh ? [ crowd chattering ] How did you find him ? ( male # 2 ) What was it like , Superboy ? ( female # 1 ) What 's gonna happen to him ? You 'll have to talk to him . He 's Superboy today . So what was it like being Superboy ? How about an interview ? Weren 't you afraid ? - Just one question . - What 's gonna happen now ? Well , you see Superboy was in trouble so he asked me for his help , and I wasn 't doing nothing . I said like , hey . And uh , and .. ... and so , I came out here and this guy was giving a really hard time . [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

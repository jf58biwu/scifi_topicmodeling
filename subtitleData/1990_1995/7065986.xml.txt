What exactly was that , Mr. Brower ? A gallbladder , sir . My office . Now . The gallbladder . The activities period was created for intellectual enrichment . Which is why I have such a problem with this Horror Club of yours . What was that film you were watching ? " Death , Death , Death . " " " Death , Death , Death . " Oh , Lord ! " Part Two . " Don 't you see ? Senseless violence is not entertainment ? What is it , then ? Why ? Why do you watch these films ? - Really ? - Yeah , yeah . Help me understand . I guess it 's kind of an escape . Like , uh ... Like lighting up a marijuana cigarette and escaping the real world , hmm ? Like watching a pornographic sex film , getting an erection and raping someone ? Is that what you mean ? You know , I don 't think erections rape people . People rape people . Consider the Horror Club banned . Banned ! Hey ! You will bring me the next videotape or video game you plan to show . I will watch it . If I can stand it , and if I approve , you will be allowed to show it . Until that time , the club is canceled . Don 't let me detain you , Mr. Brower . You live around here , kid ? I live ... I live about three blocks down . - These people friends of yours ? - No , sir . Well this is none of your business then , is it ? Go home . Do your homework . Go home . My father .

Come on . What are you doing ? I 'll be right there . Well , hurry up . Listen carefully . For the next two hours you 're going to experience mind program entry , a powerful force , not unlike hypnosis , transmitted through the television 's blanking signal . It 's going to alter your reality . Who the hell are you ? Take this seriously , Michael ! You 'll be watching a murder through the eyes of a killer , and you 'll affect his actions . It won 't be pretty . No kidding ! There is one limitation . You must stalk and kill within the time limit of the program . - Like a video game , right ? - Video games are ancient history . This is the first disk in four . If times runs out , you 'll not play the next disk . That could be dangerous . Do not let that happen ! One final detail ... You must think like a killer . Cover up any clues . Leave no witnesses , no evidence . And most importantly , enjoy the fear ! Wait a minute . Well , let 's party . The gate . The gate . On the right . That 's it . That 's it . Inside . Choose one . Upstairs . Ah . Bingo ! Do it . Do it ! What are you waiting for ? Ahhh ! Ahhh ! Make sure he 's dead . Good . A little creativity . Excellent . You got what you came for .

Try that . How ' bout that ? Huh ? How ' bout that ? It was so real ! But , man , what happened ? What 's the plot ? Just forget the plot , man . I don 't remember any story . There was all this blood . And , you know , like , my hands were shaking , too . It was sick ! See , I told you it would blow your mind . Yeah , man , Kyle , you were right . - The feeling ... I loved it , man ! - So , you got it on you ? - Patience , Kyle . - No , man , if it 's as good as you say ... I just want to play it a couple of more times , then I promise , you 'll get it . - Hey ! - What the hell were their problems ? Jerks ! Buddies forever ? Forever . Igor . Yes , Master ? Dial l-800-555-FEAR . What the hell ? Shoot ! Hey , Mr. Keller . Can I come in and speak with Kimberly for a moment , please ? All right , thanks . Come in . Kim , somebody to see you . Hi . - He came to see Kim . - Oh , really ? ... nearly four times the amount of aid the President wants Congress to approve . And in local news , there was a grisly murder in the quiet suburban town of Mountview today . Late this afternoon , the body of 42-year-old William Tebbs was discovered in the bedroom of his home , - located in an exclusive west side area of Mountview . - Poor man . - Tebbs was brutally stabbed . - So it happened near here . Local police conducted a thorough search of the area . An intensive house-to-house investigation is now under way . Jeez . - Police are asking cooperation of local residents . - Oh , my God ! Did you say something ? Listen , uh ... Can you tell Kim that I 'll stop by later ? I have to go . Sorry . ... and that 's when police discovered the mutilated body . Police conducted a thorough search of the area in hopes of finding the murder weapon . But so far , it has not been found . Can 't be . Can 't be . For reasons unknown , Tebbs 's foot was severed from his body . It , too , has yet to be found . Police say they have no leads on any suspects in connection with Tebbs 's gruesome murder . Mountview has never been touched by such a tragedy as this . Now come the questions of who and why . Hey , kid . You following me ? I ... Listen , I can explain . Explain what ? You don 't have to explain anything . Or do you ? You 're inside a police line . Now this is the second time I 'm telling you , go home . Go . Be sure you put it in a safe place . I 'm sorry , sir , there 's no such number listed . That 's impossible ! - I 'm sorry , sir . You have a call , Master . Hello , Michael . You sucker ! Who are you ? What did you do ? If I were you , I would address that question to myself . Okay , who killed that man , and what 's happened ? You were there , Michael . You know exactly what you did . Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Trickster . Where were we ? Ah , yes . You may not remember the details , my boy , but I am positive you remember you controlled the disk . - You controlled what happened . - What ? So you take responsibility . How did you get in here ? You invited me in . That 's how it always works . Michael , don 't you have anything good ? Never leave home without it . From the top of the charts ... To a space in your heart . Stop that ! Stop it ! Knock it off ! So you did it . Who killed that man ? What was on that disk ? The murder . What else ? You know for a minute there , I didn 't think you 'd go through with it . When he got up and started dancing around the room ... Classic . How do you know ? I was there when you cut off his foot . It was art . It was magic . It wasn 't supposed to be real ! Real . Unreal . What 's the difference ? So long as you don 't get caught . There 's a difference , okay ? There 's a big difference ! This doesn 't make any sense ! It doesn 't have to make sense . All these horror movies you watch ... Does " Death , Death , Death " make sense ? No . It 's not about sense . It 's about death , death , death . I didn 't kill the man . I didn 't even know him ! There lies the beauty . You had no motive . It was totally random . Like in the animal world , prey never has a name . It was primal . I can 't wait to see what you do next . Next ? Wait a minute ! There is no next . Yes , there is . No , there 's not ! Yes , there is ! You must eliminate the witness . There was a witness ? Two , if you count me . But I 'll never turn you in . They could pump a million volts through me . They could bust my fingers , one by one , by one , by one . They could dig out my eyes ... But ... No country-western music , please . Every man has his limits . I thought it was just a game . You know , a stupid video game . Trust me . Play the second disk . - How could there be a witness ? - Oh , come on , sport . You 're more than just the voyeur you wish to be , you 're in this now . You won 't survive on your own . I 'm willing to help you . But you have to play all the disks . Hey , I 've done pretty good so far . Have you ? I 'm in deep stuff . Oh , God . Here , boy , come on . Here , boy , come on . Come on . Hey , wait a minute ! Shoot ! Hey . Hey . I know you 're a nice dog . Please , please give me the foot . Okay ? I promise , I 'll never ask you for anything else again . Okay ? Just give me the foot . Thanks ! What do you got there ? What are you looking at ? Come on , Zak . Get outta here . Hey , dude . Hey ! Yo , Michael . Hey , dirtbag , I 've been callin ' all day . Did you skip school ? Uh , no , I ... I got mono . That 's harsh . Anything I can do ? Nah , that 's all right . Can I come in ? Kyle , I don 't think it 's such a good idea right now . Okay , okay . Listen , I have to get goin ' . I have to go to bed and all , you know ... - Hey , did ya hear about the murder ? - Yeah , I did . Yeah , that 's pretty cool havin ' a murder in our own neighborhood and everything . Kyle , a guy just died , and you think that 's cool ? No , I don 't mean cool , but it 's interesting . Forget it ! I 'll see you . Hey , listen Michael , if you 're gonna be laid up , how ' bout letting me borrow Brainscan ? Kyle , idiot , will you get off my back about that ? No , no . If you don 't wanna let me see it , if you just want to be a jerk about it , - just say so , that 's all ! - Bye , Kyle . You , too . * Shouldn 't have to be like this * Shouldn 't have to be like this * Shouldn 't have to be like this Jeez ! Hey . Hi , Michael . I 'm sorry , were you sleeping ? Well , actually , maybe I may have dozed off . Can I come in ? Oh , yeah , I 'm sorry . Yeah , they 're all over the neighborhood . I , uh , went to all your teachers , and I got your homework for the week . Oh , thanks . My parents said you stopped by ? Yeah , I did . I just wanted to find out about some homework . We don 't have any classes together , Michael . Oh , we don 't , do we ? Oh , here 's your mail . Oh , thanks . And I brought The Montie . I have a lot of pictures in it this week . Oh . That 's , uh ... That 's really nice . Uh ... Damn ! Wait a minute . Sorry , I got it , I got it . Thanks a lot . Is everything okay ? You should probably get going . Oh , okay ... I 'll , um ... Let myself out . Thanks for stoppin ' by . Call me if you need anything . Yeah , I will . Jeez ! Telephone , Master . Talk to me . You have a call , Master . I 'm back . Well , pal , so glad to see you again . - Where should we begin ? Where 's the second disk ? - I can 't play it . You have to play the game . No ! - What will you say to them , then ? - What do you mean ? Why did you leave school the day of the murder , Mr. Brower ? Where were you the night of the murder ? Were you alone , Mr. Brower ? Where 's your father , Mr. Brower ? Where 's your mother , Mr. Brower ? Shut up ! Oh , I don 't believe they 'll find that answer satisfactory . - They haven 't found me yet ! - The witness has yet to speak . - There 's still time to play the second disk . - Look ! I don 't have the second disk ! Don 't lie to me , Michael . You received it today . - Can 't play it ! - You mean you don 't want to play it . No ! I trashed it . Does that compute ? Pure fantasy . You did nothing of the sort . Play it . The witness has to die . I 'll play it for the police . That could be very dangerous . I 'll tell them what happened . I 've got nothing to lose . Very well , play it for the police . I wish you luck . Shut up , all right ! Just shut up a minute ! The real question is are you a winner or a loser ? My name 's Michael Brower . I 'm 16 , and I 'm scared to death . I 'm not sure what this tape 's gonna prove , but if I 'm the killer , consider this my confession . Uh , Igor , dial 1-800-555-FEAR . Yes , Master . Well , here goes nothing . Oh , jeez ! Oh , God , I played . I played . What happened ? My name 's Michael Brower . I 'm 16 , and I 'm scared to death . I 'm not sure what this tape 's gonna prove , but if I 'm the killer , consider this my confession . Igor , dial 1-800-555-FEAR . Yes , Master . Well , here goes nothing . What ? What ? Wait a minute ! I sat there ! I swear to God I didn 't leave . Kyle ! No ! Not this . Dial Kyle ! Yes , Master . Please answer ! Kyle , please , Kyle , answer ! Oh , man , Kyle , talk to me . Kyle , please ! Who is this ? Answer me . Later . Hi . I heard . Michael . I really didn 't know him , but , um , Kyle came to my house last night . He brought me this . He started a petition to restart the Horror Club . He said you guys had had a fight , and he wanted me to bring it to you personally . I really didn 't know him . My dad didn 't wanna let him in the house . Yeah . That 's Kyle . You know ... I already miss him . God , I miss him . - Mountview was horrified today by the news of yet another hideous crime committed in their small community . High school student , Kyle Hillard , is the second murder victim in as little as three days . Shortly after Hillard 's body was identified , chief homicide investigator Lieutenant Hayden arrived at Mountview High to question those known to have been closest to the victim . Already , residents are fearing the possibility of a serial killer . Any foul play suspected ? Hello , Michael . You son of a gun , you killed Kyle ! No , you killed the witness . Kyle wasn 't a witness ! He didn 't even see anything . Not a witness in the strictest sense , but he knew things about you . Kyle was my only friend ! And you ticked him off ! Nice going , Michael . Got anything to eat ? Please . Don 't look in there . Don 't be afraid , Michael . Nothing in there but frozen meat . Loose ends like Kyle can 't be left to dangle . - Hayden would have tied it around your neck like a noose . - Why are you doing this ? You chose me , Michael . I didn 't choose you . You left a clue behind ... In the second disk . No more games . I know . Kyle 's death still hurts , but do you really feel guilty for what you 've done ? The part of you which did these things , It 's deep inside , and it 's in everyone . Be honest . If you don 't feel the guilt , why accept the punishment ? Don 't answer that . Trust me , Michael . If you want this to end , don 't answer the door . Get off my back . A tarantula ! Woo-woo-woo-woo ! Hello . I 'm Lieutenant Hayden . This is my partner , Sergeant Martin . We 've met before . Twice , I believe . Yeah , yeah , I know . Um , can I help you ? Yes , you can help me . Michael ? Michael Brower ? Yeah . May we come in ? Yeah , I guess so . Um , yeah , come this way . You haven 't been in school lately . No , I haven 't . I 've been sick . Sorry to hear that . I really am . We heard a lot about you today from your classmates . Really ? Well , I hope good stuff . Well , no . To be perfectly frank , Michael , you were described as , uh ... What was the word they used , Sergeant ? Frightening . - Frightening and strange and weird . Freak came up a couple a times . Sergeant Martin has something I 'd like you to see . Good friend of yours ? Yeah . Yeah , he was my best friend . You don 't have many friends , do you , Michael ? Listen , is there anything you guys want ? We want to find the killer . I want to catch him . How do you spend your free time , Michael ? Just hanging around and staying out of trouble . Your voice sounds very familiar to me . - Are you sure you didn 't call Kyle 's house after the murder ? - No , no , that wasn 't me . Of course it wasn 't . But , Michael , if you are anything but the class misfit , which I know must give you a lot of pain , I 'm gonna find out about it , you understand ? Take it easy . He 's a very sad boy . Maybe , but somethin 's there . Yeah , ashes . And he made the phone call . Check with the phone company . All right . What 's with the ashes ? There were fresh ashes in the fireplace . It 's summer . He was burning something . - I think we just got very lucky . - Maybe . - What the hell you doin ' ? - I 'm sick of you doin ' 20 m.p.h. in this town . Gimme the keys . * Dig , dig , dig for yourself * Dig , dig , dig for your soul * Dig , dig , dig ... Slob . Hi , Mike . Fixed myself a little snack . Hope you don 't mind . They think it 's me . Of course they do . Right now Hayden only suspects you . How long you think it 's gonna be before he has proof , huh ? A few hours ? Few minutes , maybe . Tick-tock , tick-tock , hey , Mike ? You see today 's paper ? " Special edition . " Ooh ! " Interview with best friend . " " All of Mountview High was in a state of shock . " So on , so on , so on . " One student 's loss was greater ...

Buddies forever ? Damn you ! Hold still ! Scared of blood ? Remind you of something ? That road ? The rain ? Your mother ? Let go of me . Play it , Michael . Or forget all this . Join your mother . Take your own life . You 've thought of it many times before . You could be with her forever . You started this , and now you 're afraid to finish it , just like you 're afraid of everything else ! Of Kimberly , of Fromberg , of telling your father how sick you are of being left alone all the time . Of your mother , who abandoned you . I 'm trying to help you ! But you won 't let me . How ? A bargain , between friends . Play " Part Three , " but you only need to remove the clue . No killing . There 's no clue . It 's just a trick . You just don 't trust me . Wait a minute ! Come back !

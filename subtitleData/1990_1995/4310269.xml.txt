 [ Woman Narrating ] " Previously on " Earth 2 . Julia Heller , initial check-in . Code XO482 . I 've joined you on the planet . Monitoring Eden Project . [ Sighs ] And I know you planned the crash . [ Danziger ] Half rations again ? Sorry . The hydrocompressor 's doing its best . It wasn 't meant to condense for a group this size or air this dry . We are looking for bodies of water in the vicinity right now . You mean we 're gonna have to drink water out of the ground ? We 're gonna treat it first , Uly . Oh . I 'd just as soon find some to jump in . No offense , but without our dry-soap stalls , some of us could use an old-fashioned bath . [ Bess Narrating ] This new planet isn 't easy on people . They 're used to having so much that isn 't here . That 's one thing about growing up on Earth : I know how to make do . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . You know what ? Why don 't you let me take a turn ? Thank you . Okay . [ Bess Narrating ] Like our doctor . Our lives are in her hands . But instead of the latest technology , she has none ofher equipment , and she 's all alone . How is she supposed to make do ? [ Computer Voice ] Respond immediately . [ Man 's Voice ] Heller , is that you ? What 's your position , citizen ? It 's me . You can forget my position . Join me on virtual . I want to see you . Sound 's distorting . Why don 't you try again without screaming ? Citizen , s - Screaming ? Did you accuse me of screaming ? I was not screaming . I don 't scream . Even at a citizen who 's failed to call in for weeks . My God , this planet is rough . You barely resemble your holocard . We 've had a rough time . I can imagine . It 's a miracle you managed to survive without our help . It 's a miracle we survived the crash that you caused . No , the Council had nothing to do with that . Eden was Blalock 's job . And when he couldn 't red tape it to death , he got desperate . I was on that ship . But you weren 't supposed to be . Not that that excuses anything . The bomb , the crash - Blalock went overboard , and that 's one of the reasons they put him out to pasture . And how am I supposed to know that you 're not here to finish what he started ? The Council is light-years beyond vendettas . We only wanna focus on the cause , to settle this planet on our terms . So if I had given you my position , you would have sent provisions , water ? So you 're in an arid region ? Well , yes , we would send water . How ? I mean , we must be thousands of miles apart . Otherwise your heat-seekers would have found us already , wouldn 't they ? Doctor , I realize that you 've been through a trauma , but do you honestly think I would aim weapons at you ? You know what I think ? I think you 're a liar . I think you 're all liars . I think I 'm a liar for thinking I could trust the Council . That 's what I think . Don 't cut me off , citizen . You need me , damn it . Do not - [ Chattering ] Danziger . Yeah . We have an emergency . Overnight , Grendlers stole our reserve water , apparently for the containers . They just dumped the water everywhere . Yeah , I heard . But our scanner has located a sizable body of water , 12 kilometers to the south . Yeah , I know . We 're going to need the dune-rail rigged right away . I would say six drums could be strapped safely in the back to haul the water . Like that ? Good job . Yeah , I figured Walman and I could make two trips before sunset . Well , I was hoping for three , and I 'm going . No , that 's not what I had in - I need you to work on the compressor , Walman . I 'll keep in contact on the gear . You think we can make it there and back in , uh , five hours ? What do you think ? I think yes . If you want a break , I 'll spell you . You 've driven before ? Mm-hmm . On the stations . A voice-activated taxi ? This is a whole different thing . Doesn 't look that difficult . Mm . Oh , it 's hot . I hope I brought enough water . You didn 't . We 're gonna need triple that . It 's all right . I put some in that tank back there . [ Engine Sputtering , Stalls ] What happened ? We stopped . Vehicle , start . Vehicle , start . Oh , man . Danziger . What ? What is it about me that bothers you so much ? You 're too confident and optimistic . My parents call those virtues . I suppose they are if you 're an Adair . What 's that supposed to mean ? What , you think I 'm some kind of spoiled rich lady , is that it ? I think you 're a lady who 's used to finding what she needs right at her fingertips . It hasn 't quite sunk in yet that you 're on a whole new world where a lot can go wrong . Really wrong . Well , I rely on you to be skeptical enough for all of us . Don 't worry . I won 't disappoint you . I just don 't get this . We are completely out of juice . Well , can 't we just convert direct rays ? Yeah , but it 'll delay us . We have to let it charge for a couple hours . Well , I guess I 'd better call camp then , huh ? Base camp , come in . Uly ? Uly , come speak to your mother . They won 't be back until sunset . Oh , more magic pills . How are you gonna heal me this time ? This one 's spliced with a plasma D.N.A. strand . You take these things as fast as I can make them . [ Beeps ] Don 't you ever wonder if you can trust me ? Hey , I checked around . You 're the best doc in town . Well , your system doesn 't seem to be rejecting it . That 's a good thing . How long before it works ? Maybe a few hours . Just don 't get your hopes up too high . Hey , Doc , why did they pick me ? You got a theory for that ? The Eden Project ? No , the Terrians . Why did they decide to talk to me ? I don 't know . I can 't explain a fraction of what I 've seen the Terrians do . You think they 're out there ? They 're always out there . [ Bird Caws ] [ Bird Caws ] What are you doing ? Haulin' water 's gonna be hard work . Might as well rest while we can . It 's too hot to do anything else . That 's for you . Oh , come on . Don 't be silly . There 's only one blanket . There 's room enough for both of us . [ Insect Buzzing ] [ Sighs ] If I fall asleep , don 't let me stay out too long . Of course . What ? What is it ? I think I should check the collectors . See if they 're on . [ Rumbling ] - Watch out ! - Danziger ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Oh , wait , my gear . Devon . They 're not following us . I think we should let them know our intentions . What ? Hello ? Hello . We 're friends . We 'rejust looking for water . We don 't mean any harm . You 're nuts . Stop it ! [ Screams ] Damn it , Adair ! You can 't shoot them . I wasn 't shooting them . I was answering fire . There 's a difference . Oh , great . Oh . This gear is shot . They 're still there , blocking the pass . Maybe . No . Or maybe they 're just waiting for our next move . What is our next move ? Well , we have to go easy . These Terrians could be different from the other ones we 've met . I agree . So why don 't I try and get our wheels ? Nice and easy . I 'll circle round and pick you up . No , let 's , uh - let 's walk the ridge first . See what 's up ahead . Okay . Fine . We 'll walk the ridge . Wanna take a break ? I 'm fine . Look , if you 're thirsty - I 'm okay . You 've heard those old Earth legends about people dying of dehydration ... with water left in their canteens , haven 't you ? Don 't ration yourself too hard . Nobody 's dying . We still have almost a full canteen left anyway . Suit yourself . Adair , come look . Come here . See ? Well , we did something right . Yeah . Look who 's here . Let 's get back to the rail . Wait . Wait , let 's walk to the lake first . It 's only a couple kilometers . Why walk when we could drive ? 'Cause maybe the dune-rail 's what 's frightening the Terrians . If we show them what we want , just a little water , maybe we can avoid a confrontation , don 't you think ? I think that if we have the rail , we stand a better chance of outrunning them . That 's what I think . Let 's check out the lake first . Listen . Don 't ask my advice ... if your mind is made up , okay ? I considered your opinion . I just - Wanna do it your way . Yeah . I am capable of making a decision , you know . I 'll bet you 've had lots of experience heading up your own multi-orbit firm , and all . [ Chuckles ] Well , as a matter of fact , I did . And , uh , for the record , I was not spoiled . My parents were very strict and expected a lot of me . Must have been tough . Oh , I 'm sure it didn 't compare to life in the Quadrant . What , you run biostats on all of us ? Yale has everyone 's job applications on file . I 've scanned them . So you got me pigeonholed , huh ? Third-generation indentured stiff , problem with authority , workin ' to pay off the debt of his grandparents ' passage up . Is that it ? Well , it 'd help me to understand ... why a man like you would sign on for a job like this . A man like me would be damned if he 's gonna pass his debt on to his kid . True 's not gonna grow up and be a drone . Please don 't use that term . Well , I 'm sorry . " Immigrant worker , " that 's what you bluebloods say , isn 't it ? At least in the Quadrant we knew we were drones . Look . Inherited debt is terribly unjust . A lot of us were working to amend that law . Yeah , yeah , and as soon as we get to New Pacifica , you 're gonna send me home a rich man , Adair . Actually , I issued payroll on departure . Back on the stations , you are already debt-free . Oh , yeah ? Then how come here on planet G889 you still act like the boss ? Fine . We 'll do it your way . Forget the lake . We 'll take the rail like you said . Good . Julia . ! Julia . ! There 's something wrong . ! [ Groans ] Oh , my leg . [ Yells ] My leg is killing me . Take it easy . Take it easy . You 're gonna be fine . It 's not fine ! It hurts ! It hurts because it 's healing . The drug must be working . It 's not working . If it 's working , give me something for the pain . I can 't . I gotta move it first . No , you gotta be kidding ! Your bones are adding cells at a hyper-accelerated rate . My God ! We 've gotta get your muscles moving . Okay . No , don 't " fl " ex it . Don 't " fl " ex it . We gotta " fl " ex it all the way . You ready ? No , my leg is on fire ! Okay . [ Yells ] All right . Damn it ! If it doesn 't heal straight , I 'm gonna have to break it again . No , no , no . Flex it . No . Okay . Oh ! Okay . Again . [ Gasping ] Okay , the pain 's going away . It 's getting better . Keep " fl " exing . Okay . It 's getting better . Okay . Just relax . Put your leg up . Good . Thanks . Thank you . [ Beeps ] Can I walk ? No . You 're gonna have to wait until the bones harden . But I 'm gonna walk . I 'm gonna walk soon , right ? Yeah , I think you are . You know , you got a lousy bedside manner . This is the thanks I get ? I was hurting back there . You-You didn 't even care . I cared . I just wasn 't crying about it . I did not cry . You certainly were making a lot of noise . I thought you " fl " yboys were supposed to be tough . You know , it 's amazing . The nastier you get , the more I like you . Does that bother you ? I mean , there 's only two possible explanations . Either you hate me and you can 't stand the thought of me liking you , or you like me and you can 't stand the thought of me liking you too . Well , there is one other possibility . Perhaps you 've overestimated your importance in the grand scheme of human events ... by assuming that every woman feels something when they 're in your presence . Perhaps I don 't feel anything at all . That 's not it . Aah ! Easy . Okay , let 's go . We 're outta here . Come on . Come on . [ Engine Starts ] [ Tire Spinning ] What happened ? I don 't know . Uh , hit that pedal when I tell ya . I 'm gonna give us a push . You ready ? Go . Other pedal . Other pedal . Oh . All right , stop . All right . This will do it . You ready ? Go ! It 's okay . Stop . [ Electrical Crackling ] Devon ! [ Danziger Groaning ] Hey , Adair . Adair . Devon . Ow . You okay ? Oh , God . Oh , my head . Yeah , my whole right side . Oh , God . Oh , we need a plan . First things first . We need water . [ Straining ] Oh , what have they done to us ? Whatever they did , it was much worse for the rail . Look . They buried it . You can say you told me so . My mouth is so dry . Can you reach my canteen ? Maybe . Attagirl . Mmm . Come on . There you go . Mmm . Okay ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Oh . [ Laughs ] Oh , you need some . Sorry . Yeah . Here . Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Oh . [ Sighs ] Let 's get down to business . We have to cut our way out of here . Come on . How are we gonna do that ? This stuff feels stronger than biocord . I got a knife in my belt . Okay . [ Bess Narrating ] It 's amazing how hardship can bring out the best in people ... and the worst . Morgan . Morgan ! [ Groans ] Didn 't you tell me that rationing had eased up ? Well , yeah . Well , you brought me a full cup of water , and I drank it . Julia says we haven 't heard a thing from Devon and Danziger . Rationing is still on , Morgan . Did you steal the water ? No . I - I gave you my half . Oh . [ Bess Narrating ] Like I said , the worst and the best . [ Alonzo ] Hey , Doc , I got something to show you . - What 's that ? - These crutches . Uh , you can have them back . I don 't need them anymore . Oh , stay where you are . Here . Thank you . I don 't know how to thank you . Don 't . I was just doing my job . That was more than your job . You nearly killed yourself to find that formula . I 'm a doctor . That 's what they made me for . Nobody made you , Julia . No matter what they did to your genes , you should take credit for who you are . I wish that were true . I have to do this . You know , you surprise me . I 've been surprising myself actually . Hey , Alonzo . Did I just see what I thought I saw ? Were you outside walking ? Yeah , check it out . Two legs , fully operational . - Well , congratulations . - " [ Alonzo ] Thank you . " [ Morgan ] Try not chewing any gum for a while . [ Laughter ] That 's great . The lake looked much closer from above . What ? We 're getting there . There . That 's gotta be it . [ Danziger ] Oh . ! Look . We-We gotta find a better way down . Why don 't we go around and see - No . More hiking . Can 't do that . I can make this . What about a rope ? Don 't you have a rope ? I can make this . Wait . Danziger . ! John . ! John ? John , are you okay ? Answer me . Are you okay ? Yeah . I think the rope will reach from here . [ Computer ] Respond immediately . Danziger , be sure to test the water before you drink it . Forget that . It 's no time to be picky . Okay . Come on , baby . Oh , yeah . Sink . Come on , sink . [ Electrical Crackling ] What happened ? Hold on . Hold on ! Come on . Come on , Danziger . Hold tight . Come on . Just a few more feet . Come on . Come on up . Come on . Get up here . There . There . Oh , God . Oh , my God . They 're here - the Terrians . [ Lens Whirs ] [ Devon ] What are they doing ? Look . [ Devon ] Do you think they were trying to warn us before ? No , they were trying to protect their power source . Go on , diggers . It 's yours . We don 't want it . We 're finished anyway . No . No , we 're gonna make it . It 's gonna be dark soon . They 're gonna send someone for us . I know it . Better call back . Hello ? John . Come get us . Send water . John , they 're broken , remember ? On the double . Ms. Adair 's orders . That 's what you wanted , right , boss ? Oh , no . Oh , no , you don 't . Get up . Get up . Come on . You gotta walk with me . Keep on walking . Get up . Come on . [ Yale ] We should go searching before dark . They did say they were gonna be late . But now they 're not answering their gear . Is this all the condenser can do ? So , that 's it . Quick , what are the warning signs of dehydration again ? Disorientation , fatigue , mania . Disorientation . Did you say disorientation ? I forgot where I was for a second . Hey , I think I 'm disoriented . Hey , let me help you with that , okay ? He 's been doing that incessantly-walking . I get thirsty just looking at him . Hey , I 'm , uh , goin ' out . Watch for them comin ' back , okay ? You know , it 's not such a bad thing on this planet . Having someone to trust , someone to count on . I don 't know what I would do without Morgan . [ Sighs ] J - John ? John , come on . Get up . Come on . We gotta keep - Come on . You gotta get - Come on . Get up , John . Devon , tell True - I 'm not gonna tell True anything , John . You 're gonna get yourself up right now . Devon , I want her to grow up - grow up optimis - confident , like you . Stop it now , okay ? You stop it . You 're gonna tell True that yourself , all right ? Now you just get up and - Don 't fight me , Adair . You tell her . Just say yes . Yes . Yes . John , come on . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Oh , no . John . John . John , just hold on here , okay ? You just hold on . I 'm gonna go get help . Now you just hold on . Hold on . [ Engine Starts ] [ Engine Off ] You see them ? No . There 's something I wanna talk to you about . You wanna know about this afternoon ? What it meant ? Do I ? I don 't know what it meant . Sounds like a conversation you 've had before . I know what I 'm sure about . I 'm glad it happened . And I enjoyed it . And I care about you . But ? But after that , I don 't know . Why don 't you just tell me the truth ? I don 't know " is " the truth . I mean , what did that kiss mean to you ? It means we made a mistake . One kiss ? Haven 't you ever kissed a guy before ? Yes . But this is different . Because you feel something . Is that wrong ? In my work , yes . You 're a better doctor if you don 't feel anything for your patients , right ? To some degree . Yeah , but it doesn 't make you happy . I mean , a wonderful thing happens , and you 're miserable because you can 't explain it . I was put here for a reason , Alonzo . I 've got more important things to think about than us . Well , don 't let me stand in your way . [ Devon ] Oh , God . [ Dune-rail Approaches ] Danziger , look here . Nice driving , Adair . Hey ... water . Where did you - Groundwater , under the rail . I think the Terrians moved it there so we would find it . Oh . Oh . How did you - There 's , uh - There 's moisture in it . You were out cold . I thought I 'd lost you . It was crazy . Then I had this , uh - this thought that ... [ Swallows ] I was - It was a good one . Come on . Drink up . We have plenty . Yeah . I thought I 'd heard the last from you . No , I didn 't . But I thought a lot about our last talk , and you made me realize something - loyalty . It 's a tricky thing . Loyalty from a person of your talent has to be earned . I don 't blame you for doubting us . But I can remind you why you used to believe . The Council created on those stations ... a world that was better than any world that came before . It was clean . It was safe . It was free of almost all con " fl " ict . And they created you . Why ? Because that world is not made by magic . It is made by hard work and hard decisions . Decisions which cannot be made with the heart ... but must be with the mind , with a mind like yours . I don 't say that we can 't use Adair and her crew , but they have to be guided . They need you to show them the way . Can I count on you , Doctor ? Are you with us ? Yes . That 's never changed . All right . Just settle down . I know you haven 't had water in a while , so - Come back here , Uly . I 'm gonna get you . Now we know where to find more . Be careful , Bess , will you ? Be careful . Hey , mind if I try that next ? I don 't know . Can we afford to have you walking around and clean shaven ? Who 's gonna protect these women ? Julia , I - I just wanted to tell you that you - you did an exceptional job with Alonzo . Thank you . I , uh - I know that I had my doubts about you at first , but I was completely wrong . We could not have made it this far without you . Well , like you once said , we don 't really have much choice , do we ? [ Danziger ] Hey , Adair . Hey , Danziger . You know , I said some things out there , uh - Hey , we both did . Yeah . Well , I just wanted to , you know , let you know . You 're all wet . You ! [ Chattering , Laughter ] [ Bess Narrating ] See , I think all we need to survive are simple things - water , our health . Especially each other . If we can only learn to live with each other , I know we 'll make a home here . [ Screaming , Laughter ]

 [ Man Narrating ] After the first atomic bomb , Einstein said . " . " If I had known where this would lead , I 'd have been a watchmaker . " So , here I am ... either at the end of a world ... or the beginning of one . A record must be kept ... for the sanity of all concerned . I 'll start from when the time slips were just beginning . [ Man ] Power , gentlemen . Power enough ... to run the world or destroy it . Most of all , you 've got to control it . That 's where I come in . Status ? [ Man # 2 ] D. D. Q. on 72 . All systems go . - [ Alarm Sounding ] - [ Man # 7 ] Ladies and gentlemen ... I give you the atom - new and improved . [ Man # 2 On P.A. ] Power level - 75 . Climbing . Eighty-four , 89 , 93 , 96 ... 96.5 , 97.7 ... 98.1 , 98.5 , 98.9 - [ Man ] It worked ! A weapon . A weapon beyond ... your wildest imagination , General . A particle beam that simply makes the enemy disappear . Project Safe World can give your armed forces the power of a black hole . - [ Loud Warbling ] - [ General ] What the hell was that ? Some negligible atmospheric vibration , huh ? - Barely measurable . - Will they fund the next step ? Time out , Doc . In the three months since you 've been testing this thing ... we 've had freak weather , people disappearing and these time slips . I 'm sorry , but we have a very public crisis brewing here . All right , so we have a side effect to contend with . It 's not the end of the world . The president is getting a sore throat from denying any knowledge of this program . Joe , I 've gotta tell him something . Yes , well , tell him when we implode an object ... it slips out oftime . And right now , when it goes , it sort of leaves a door open . What you 're trying to say is that you seriously screwed up . He wanted a weapon . He 's got a weapon . We got work to do . Well ? He didn 't go for it . Joe , it 's not over . - There 's still time . - [ Man ] The cloud ' ; building again , joe . I wanted to create a weapon that wouldn 't destroy the world . And look what I did . [ Man ] Is it reversible ? Oh , my God , I hope so . It needs more work . I 'll need the prototype laser tonight . [ Female Computerized Voice ] Good afternoon , Dr. Buchanan . Would you like me to drive ? No . I 'm feeling energetic . I 'll drive . [ Female Newscaster ] Death and damage attributed to this phenomenon . There is still no statement from the Pentagon . And today , White House spokesperson Mary Ann Sutter ... again denied any connection between these severe stratospheric disturbances - apparent slips in time - and recent weapons testing at the Hawkings Institute in California . In other news , a tribute will be held tomorrow ... for the last remaining part of the Brazilian rain forest . [ Computer ] I am tracking intruders on your property . Shall I call security ? Don 't worry , baby . It 'sjust neighborhood children . [ Computer ] Very good . [ Girl Speaking , indistinct ] What goes around comes around . [ Continues , indistinct ] - ; [ Humming ] - What have we here ? - Is it dead ? - It died this morning . - How do you know it 's dead ? - She got a new one . Ah ! Progress . Secular seculorum . - " Finiculi , Finicula . " - " Que Sera , Sera . " Farewell , old bike . [ Wind Howling ] There 's a storm coming , kids . Let 's get inside . I said , come on ! Kids , come on ! - Come on ! Leave the bike ! - No ! [ Yelling ] [ Whinnies ] [ BoyYelling ] [ Whinnies ] [ Whinnies ] - [ Beeping ] - Come on here . [ Computer ] Zero pollution . Maximum ozone shield . Something tells me we 're not in New Los Angeles anymore . Access mainframe . [ Computer ] lam sorry , Dr. Buchanan . The central computer at Hawkings Institute does not respond . Access mainframe through uplink Tyco orbiter . The Tyco orbiter is not in position . Uplink any available satellite . Tracking . There are no satellites . Access television . Not even any radio ? We are alone , Doctor . Jesus H. Christ ! Where am I ? No record of a middle initial for ajesus Christ , Dr. Buchanan . Very funny . Come on . In . Scientifically speaking , we are out in the sticks . [ Owl Hooting ] - [ Screeches ] - [ Gasps ] [ Bell Telling ] - j , ' [ Harpsichord ] - [ Chattering ] - What place is this ? - The Inn at Secheron . - How mayl help you ? - Well , I would like to eat . I can give you venison at two francs ... or trout at three and five . Ah . [ Chuckles ] Tell me ... what would you give me ... for this ? Fifty francs , Swiss . Fifty , plus the trout . Done . Take a seat . Mind if I join you ? Can 't stop you from sitting down . Tell me , is your attire the result of Napoleon 's defeat ... or have you been abandoned by a circus ? Where I come from , this is considered an appropriate fashion . I 'm from America . Ah , yes . America . Dr. Joseph Buchanan . I am also a doctor . Ila But why do you come to Secheron ... and deny yourself the culture of Geneva ? Well , I enjoy the distractions of country life . I scorn distraction . - There 's too much work to be done . - [ Beeping ] - Is that a timepiece ? - Yes . May I see it ? No hands . The digits change shape . Are they filled with mercury ? How do you wind it ? I don 't . It runs on electricity . Electricity ? But it 's so small . I just want you to know , sir ... that we 're all praying for you and your family . - Thank you . - You brother was such a sweet boy . May the witch who killed him burn in hell . Yes , yes . I must go . Perhaps we can discuss electricity another time . - I would like that . - Oh , yes . I would like that too , Doctor - Frankenstein . Are you not well , sir ? Yes , I 've - I 've heard of your work . You 're mistaken , sir . My work is quite unknown . [ Man ] Marie , get the doctor ' ; bag . [ Frankenstein ] Thank you . - Drive . - Come on ! Come on ! [ Thunderclaps ] Driver , stop ahead ! [ Chattering , indistinct ] Give me what I want ! - Na / Go ! - [ Yelling ] Come no more , you damn beast ! Who is responsible for this ? Who do you think ? [ Sinister Laughter ] [ Barking ] Go ! Get out ! [ Yelling 1 Get out ! Get out ! - [ Yel ls ] - [ Ye / mngg Barking ] [ Beeping , Whirring ] - Good morning , Dr. Buchanan . - Power on . Manual drive . Manual drive is commencing now . Supposition . One : We 've suffered a time slip . Two : The time slip phenomenon 's related to implosion experiments . What is the probability of reversing time slip using prototype laser projector ? That is an interesting question . Without access to the mainframe , I will need approximately 96 hours . - Go to work . - Yes , Dr. Buchanan . My sensors indicate we are near an urban center . Any instructions ? - Be a good girl . - My options are limited . - Fill it all the way to the top . - Yes , sir . [ Man ] Order . Order , please ! [ Raps Gavel ] The overwhelming evidence presented today ... will prove thatjustine Moritz did brazenly commit this most vile crime ... this unforgivable act against the people of Geneva ... and , my friends , against all mankind . Excuse me , Reverend . Are the seats next to ... the young lady over there open to the public ? Obviously , good sir , you are a stranger here . Sorry . I don 't understand . [ Reverend ] That is Lord Byron 's mistress . The Lord Byron lives here in Geneva ? Across the lake in sin ... with the poet Shelley and Mary Godwin . - [ Buchanan ] You mean Mary Shelley . - They are not married . Perhaps not . But she 's a great writer . Excuse me . A giant , you say ? Well , the tallest man I ever seen , sir . And yet , you saw him only at night ? Yes , sir . But his footprints went all over my field come morning . - I dug one up to show you , sir . - Here 's your box , sir . Raise it . Show the court . [ Laughter ] Your Honor , that was the footprint of the beast what killed my sheep . I swear it ! I 've seen it with my own eyes ! Now , what if it was the same brute what killed the little boy ? [ Laughter ] Well , how do you suppose I lost the sheep ? Huh ? How do you suppose I got this gash on my forehead ? - Spirits . - [ Laughter ] Next witness . Your Hononjustine Moritz is an innocent child . - Sir , you 've hadyoursay - She 's innocent as the blessed virgin . Forgive me , Miss Godwin . The young girl over there , is she the one on trial ? Yes . She 's accused of killing William Frankenstein , who was six . She lacks the physical strength necessary to commit the crime as described ... so , of course , she 's accused of witchcraft . It is a travesty . Yes , but excellent material for a book , I suppose . - What do you mean , sir ? - My name isjoseph Buchanan . I 'm a great admirer of your work , Miss Godwin . You must be confusing me with someone else , Mr. Buchanan . I 've never been published . Can you identify this ? It 's the locket ... that belonged to William . Can you explain how this charm came to be amongst your belongings ? When I awoke ... I found it . The truth is ... you took it after killing William Frankenstein ... after breaking his neck and wrenching his arm from his body ! Come , girl ! Admit it , and allow yourself the mercy of God 's forgiveness . No ! No ! I-l didn 't do it ! Excuse me . Now , as to the charge ofwitchcraft - Your Honor , we find Justine Moritz guilty ... of the murder of William Frankenstein . Justine Moritz , you have heard the verdict . You are hereby sentenced to hang by the neck till dead . Execution is scheduled for tomorrow at noon . Poor kid . Victor , I beg you not to go . Where are you ? I know you have returned . Reveal yourself ' [ Growls ] - [ Gasps ] Who are you ? Give me what you promised , or I will break him , Victor ! I will crush everyone around you ! Then I will crush you . [ whimpering ] You made me . Now you would destroy me . Why ? - You murdered my brother . - Mur-dered ? You stopped his life ! He was easily crushed . You should have made him strong , Victor , like me . I did not make William . No ? Then ... who did ? He was born ofwoman , you monstrous wretch . I did not ask to be made monstrous ! I am alone and miserable . Make me a mate as you promised . Make me a mate , and you will never see me again . I will never make another like you . Make me a mate ... or I will ... murder Elizabeth . Victor ! Why are you following me ? Are you from the court ? I told you , I am a doctor . I know of your discovery . Illlanma l1 @ ( F I know that you put life into that creature , and I know that he is killing . I wanted to give man the power to create life ... to free him from a cruel and fictitious god . What man ever achieved that ? Scientists ... have made far greater monsters than yours , Victor . Tell the truth . Show the world what you have created . Impossible . I 've created an abomination . What aboutjustine ? Who will free her from the mob ? You cannot let her pay for your sins . What sins ? I 'm a scientist . I cannot sin . She must die . The truth is too unbearable . If you want to ease your conscience about William , then help the girl . If they kill her , how will you live with yourselfafter that ? I don 't know . Help the girl , Victor . Continuous flow ofink contained in barrel . Remarkable . Did you make it clear that the girl is innocent ? - And you simply lick this ? - Yes . It tastes like - Peppermint . [ Laughing ] Victor , the girl . Yes , certainly . The girl is innocent . Good . Then I shall take this letter in the morning ... and deliver it to the judge in person . No , not the judge . You must deliver it to my fiancée , Elizabeth . She 's of good family , and the judge will listen to her . You are truly a marvel , Buchanan . This electric carriage - You have mastered thermodynamics ... geomagnetism , secrets of the universe . Where do you come from ? The Moon ? Mount Olympus ? I live in the same world you live in . Yes , truly . The world of science . We are brothers , Doctor . [ Spectators Gasping , Cheering ] [ Both Giggling ] - [ Growls ] - [ Both Scream ] - Who made you ? - Who are you ? Who made you ? Did Victor make you ? [ Together ] Help ! Help ! Back to the gate , boys ! - [ Growls ] - [ High-pitched Whistle ] [ Grunting ] Stop that ! Stop ... that ! - [ Gasping ] - Stop that . [ Groaning ] Frankenstein villa ? Is Elizabeth here ? If you mean Miss Levenza , she does not live in this house . Victor assures me that she is here . I have an urgent letter for her . Ah , ah ! Victor asked me to deliver it to her in person . Thank you . Stay . I will inform Miss Levenza you are here . [ Chattering , indistinct ] God disapproves of the eavesdropper , sir , as do I. Won 't you come in ? I cannot say that lam grateful , sir ... but I do thank you for your trouble . - Allow me to escort you to the judge . - But what do you mean by that ? Well , they 're going to hang Justine Moritz at noon . I 'm afraid no one could prove her innocence . But the letter explains her innocence . There is nothing here aboutjustine . Victor warns me that I must leave Geneva immediately for my safety . Where has Victor gone ? You must tell me , orjustine will die . Werner ! Listen to me . Victor 's brother is already dead . Others have been killed , and more will follow unless we act . - Victor is responsible , Elizabeth ! - Who are you ? Why would you turn me against Victor ? - Werner . - I want to help him , Eliza - Elizabeth . Reference Mary Shelley . Born : Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin . Mary Shelley . Born : 1797 . Died : 1851 . Mistress to the poet Lord Byron , and wife to the poet Percy Shelley . She is chiefly remembered as the author of the novel Frankenstein . - Hard copy novel . - Printing a hard copy . The subject matter is artificial intelligence . Miss Shelley wrote the book when she was only 19 years old ... while living with Byron and Shelley at the Villa Diodati ... presently some 200 yards north-northeast . Be forewarned , Dr. Buchanan , probability is high that they are late sleepers . [ Thunderclap ] [ Gasps ] [ Chuckles ] Maybe you could , uh , point that thing another way ? Why so ? Tourist shooting season opened today . I 've bagged three already . Yes , but I 'd hate to be shot without a proper introduction . You must be Lord Byron . I have no intention ofintroducing myself ... and I feel quite persecuted when British trespassers ioafabout my property . No , I 'm not a trespasser . I 'm an admirer . Dnjoe Buchanan . You 're not British , are you ? Well , I 'm sort of , uh , nouveau American . - What about those ? - What ? Those contrivances . Oh . These are a gift ... to one of the greatest visionaries of the I 9th century . My God . These lenses are exceptional . Are you an inventor ? A scientist . Really ? I thought all American scientists were named Benjamin Franklin . Ah . Let 's see what Mistress Marys doing . Damn . Nothing scandalous . Writing as usual . What a waste of female talent . Perhaps Miss Godwin has literary talent as well . - What do you want here , sir ? - I must see Mary . Miss Godwin . A suitor ? Oh , no . What will Shelley say ? We breakfast late , Buchanan . join us . Prove yourself an amusing guest . We suffer from too much peace here . [ Buchanan ] There is murder at hand in Geneva . Well , now , what 's this ? A bailiff . I hope . or a poet . Meet Percy Shelley , my fellow reprobate in exile . Ah , he 's risen . Joe Buchanan . - An American scientist . - Mmm . And are those slippers American too ? I 've quizzed him already , Percy . They were made by a Mr. Florsheim in a redundancy ... called New York , New York . What brings you all the way to our little paradise , Doctor ? Lust another moth drawn to Marys glib . Listen , I 'm here because of the imminent execution ofjustine Moritz . I believe he wants to take Mary to the hanging . - How romantic . - You know how it is , Percy . - Sex and death . - [ Chuckles ] Ah ! There she is . My love . Mary , allow me to introduce ... Dnjoseph Buchanan . As it happens , we 've already met . How do you do again , Dr. Buchanan ? [ Thunder Rumbling ] That is the most mysterious cloud I 've ever seen . I see a remote sunlight glean ... as though t 'were not a cloud at all ... but a gateway to a distant world . What did you want to see me about , Dr. Buchanan ? Miss Godwin , I know that you 've been following the trial ofjustine Moritz . You must help me try and stop her from hanging . - Why come to me ? - Because you know that the girl is innocent . You know the truth . Well , that 's what your book is about . What do you know of my book ? I 've only a few chapters of the story . Are you from ajournal , sir ? Worse . Maybe a publisher . Yes , I believe the girl is innocent . But I don 't know anything that would help her . Forgive me . I thought that you knew the truth . I thought that you could help me . [ jeering , Shouting ] - Back offi - Please , sir . I 've made my peace with God . The girl goes free ! [ Protesting , Shouting ] Somebody help - [ Laughter ] No ! [ Men Shouting ] [ Yelling 1 [ Groaning ] We 're going to make you better . Shh . The girl - They killed the girl . And they very nearly killed you too . I watched the whole terrible incident with these . Oh . You were very brave ... and foolish . - How did you get here ? - I sailed across the lake to rescue you . - How did you know I was writing a book ? - It 's a long story , Mary . Well , it 's usually better to start at the beginning . Suppose I show you instead ? Is this your carriage ? Yes . Yes , it is . It 's amazing . Like to go for a ride ? I 'd be delighted . Good afternoon , Mary . lam not a carriage , but a car . Let 's fly . Are we flying ? No. lt 'sjust a great suspension system . [ Horse Whinnies ] I 've never even imagined anyone like you before . Well , that 's not surprising , because I don 't exist yet . I 'm from the future . [ Chuckles ] Well , that 's absurd . I know of your book because I 've read it . But that 's impossible . I 've only just started writing . And you 'll finish it and you 'll publish it ... and you 'll add a new word to every language on Earth - Frankenstein . - This says Mary Shelley . - Congratulations . My book ! My book will be known in the future . How does it end ? How do I end ? And Shelley - Do we die young ? Do you really want to know that ? Stop the car . I 'll have my own life . Well , joe from the future , wherever did you come from ? [ Buchanan ] There . Percy 's cloud . He was right . It is the gateway to another world . I made it , came through it ... fractured the core of time and space . I wanted to do the world a favor . But like Victor Frankenstein , I created a monster . Then it 's true . Dr. Frankenstein has created a man . I 'm afraid it is . It is an abomination in the eyes of God . You don 't believe in God ? I don 't know . I see . Science is your religion . Well , I never thought of it like that . I 've tried to imagine what a man of science must live with . I think he lives with madness . With madness ? The madness of possibility . I 'm sorryifl 've said something to upset you , joe . Upset me ? Mary , you amaze me . You live in the 19th century ... and yet you understand the future infinitely better than I do . I wish I did . [ Laughing ] Percy and Byron preach free love . I practice it . You and I are under an enchantmentjoe . Will you fly to some other place in time ? I wish it were that easy . This place , this time - I don 't even understand why I ended up here . I 'm afraid I have a theory . Would you like to hear it ? Mm-hmm . I thinkyou 're here to stop Dr. Frankenstein . - Werner ? - Mistress ? - Please prepare my carriage . - Shall I drive you , Miss Levenza ? No , I must go alone ... to see Dr. Frankenstein . As you wish . Are you going to kill it ? No , quite the opposite . I must make him a mate . You were a madman . You heard him . He threatened to kill Elizabeth . Buchanan , please . I have laid all the groundwork ... but I haven 't been able to store enough electricity . I know you have abilities beyond my own in such matters . I thinkl should show you something . [ Grunting ] - [ Whimpering ] - [ Horse Whinnies ] [ Frankenstein ] What is this ? Victor , this is your future . [ Elizabeth Screaming ] [ Growling ] [ Screaming ] [ Whinnies ] Who are you ? What are you ? Victor made me . Victor ? But I am to be Victor 's wife . - He would not want you to hurt me . - I know . [ whimpering ] [ Screaming ] [ Whinnies ] A human being is no match for my creature . We are not very well made , you know . Our eyes are poor ... our limbs use muscles to the disadvantage of both . I have made wonderful improvements . Wonderful improvements . [ Men Shouting ] - Victor' - There 's something over here ! Mr. Victor ! - There he is . - Hang on asecona ' .

Good . - [ Buchanan Grunts ] - [ Thunder Rumbling ] Ah , Buchanan , you 're awake . Bring him here . I 've been studying this pamphlet that explains your carriage . I presume it can store enormous amounts of electrical power . Yes , it can . But you have to supply the superconductor ... with tremendous power to begin with . [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Thunderclap ] - You 'll get no help from me . - [ Frankenstein ] Buchanan ... it could take me a few days to analyze this machine on my own . [ Gasping ] Perhaps you would like more time to think about it ? I could let him play with you all night . [ Gasping Continues ] [ Coughing ] So , can you make it work for me ? [ Thunder Rumbling ] I must prepare . Watch him . [ Computer ] Good evening , Dr. Buchanan . My sensors indicate substantial damage to my electrical system . So forget that . Have you completed the calculations I asked for ? Yes . All probabilities indicate that ... it is not possible to reverse a time slip effect . Not possible ? Why not ? - Time space unbound . - Come on . Explain yourself . Time space unbound is the logical outcome of your experiment , Doctor . You have introduced a new condition into the physical world . - What is that ? - It 's a machine that thinks ... and talks . What is the probability ofsurviving a laser-generated implosion ? - Did you make it ? - Yes . The probability is high that you will be transported ... to a new place and time . Is it a man ? No , it is not a man . [ Thunderclap ] Are you strong enough ... to carry those cables ... to the top of the bell tower ? Yes . Victor made me very strong . - Good boy . - [ Thunderclap ] Victor did not make you , did he ? No . Look ! Can you climb up ... and connect the coil to the bottom of the cross ? [ Thunderclap ] - [ Thunderclap ] - Who made you ? I don 't know ! God , maybe ! [ Thunderclap ] Throw this over . Now the other one . - [ Chuckling ] - Who is God Maybe ? I thinkyou 'd better ask Victor about that . Yes , I will . [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunderclap ] - Load laser implosion program . - Loading now . When you get maximum power ... then you just turn my little baby on . Good-bye , Dr. Buchanan . [ Water Bubbling ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Gasps ] Leave her !

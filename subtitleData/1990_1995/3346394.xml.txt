 Three billion human lives ended on August 29 , 1997 . The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgement Day . Now they face a new nightmare , the war against the machines . The Skynet computer sent two Terminators back through time . Their mission was to destroy the leader of the resistance : John Connor , my son . One terminator was programmed to strike at me before John was born . It failed . The second was set to strike at John when he was still a child . As before , the resistance was able to send a lone warrior . A protector for John . But who would reach him first ? I need your clothes , your boots and your motorcycle . You forgot to say please . Get him off me . Pull it out . Take it . You can 't take the man 's wheels . Get off before I put you down . That 's it , goddamn it ! Car 31-D at the 6th Street bridge . - Electrical disturbance . - 10-4 , car 31-D . John , get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours . John ! Your foster parents are dicks . I 've had it with that kid . He won 't even answer me anymore . Get off your butt and help me . Todd ! - What ? - He has to clean that room of his . Oh , it 's an emergency . Hang on , I 'll get right on it . John , get your ass inside . Do what your mother tells you . She 's not my mother , Todd . This next case is interesting . I 've been following it for years . A 29-year-old female diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder . Depression , anxiety , delusions of persecution . The delusional architecture is fairly unique . She believes that a machine called a " terminator " - - Was sent back through time to kill her . Also that the father of her child was a soldier sent to protect her . He was from the future , too . 2029 , if I remember correctly . Here we are . Good morning , Sarah . Good morning . Dr. Silberman . How 's the knee ? Fine , Sarah . She stabbed me in the kneecap with my pen a few weeks ago . Repeated escape attempts ... Let 's move on . Patients can 't disrupt their rooms . See that she takes her Thorazine . - Are you John Connor 's guardian ? - What 's he done now ? - Could I speak with him , please ? - You could if he were here . - Do you have a photograph of John ? - Sure , hold on . - What is this about ? - I need to ask him a few questions . He 's a good-looking boy . May I keep this picture ? - There was a guy here this morning . - Big guy on a bike . Has that got something to do with this ? No , I wouldn 't worry about him . Thanks for your cooperation . Please insert your stolen card now . PIN number . Hurry up . This is taking too long . Go , baby ... - PIN number 9003 . - Who did you learn this stuff from ? From my mom . My real mom . Withdraw 300 bucks . Come on , baby . - Hey , it worked . - All right , easy money . Piece of cake ! - Is that her ? - Yes . - Is she pretty cool ? - No , she 's a complete psycho . That 's why she 's up at Pescadero Mental Institute . She tried to blow up the computer factory . She 's a total loser . Let 's go and spend some money . It 's like a strobe light burning right through my eyes . Somehow I can still see . - The dream 's always the same ... - Please , continue . Children look like burnt paper . Black . Not moving . And then the blast wave hits them . They fly apart like leaves . Dreams of cataclysm and the end of the world are very common . It 's not a dream , it 's real . I know the date it happens . I 'm sure it feels real . Well on August 29th , 1997 , it will feel pretty fucking real to you . Anybody not wearing a two million sunblock is going to have a bad day . You think you 're safe and alive . You 're already dead . Him , you , you 're dead . This whole place is gone . You 're living in a fucking dream , because I know what happens ! I 'm much better now . Clearer . Yes , your attitude has been much improved lately . - It 's helped me to have a goal . - And what is that ? You said that if I showed improvement after six months - - You would transfer me to minimum security . And I could have visitors . It has been six months , and I was looking forward to seeing my son . I see . Go back to what you were saying about those terminator machines . - Do they exist ? - They don 't exist . I know that now . But you 've told me many times about how you crushed one . If I had , there would have been some evidence at the factory . So you don 't believe anymore that the company covered it up ? No , why would they ? Mr. Dyson ... Mr. Dyson , the materials team is running another ... We 're running another series , you have to sign the ... " it " out . Come on , I 'll get it . I haven 't been here very long , but could you tell me if you know ... - Know what ? - Do you know where " it " came from ? I asked them once and you know what they told me ? " Don 't ask . " Good morning , Mr. Dyson . Insert key . Left on three , two , one , turn . - How are the wife and kids ? - Great , thanks . What do you think , Doctor ? - Haven 't I shown improvement ? - Sarah , here 's the problem . I think you 're just telling me what I want to hear . You don 't believe what you 're telling me . If I put you in minimum security , you 'd just try to escape again . You have to let me see my son . Please . Please . He 's in great danger . He 's naked without me . - If I could just make a phone call . - I 'm afraid not . Not for a while . I 'm recommending that you stay here for another six months . I 'll kill you , you son of a bitch . Ten cc 's of sodium pentothal . - You don 't know what you 're doing . - Get some restraints in here . You don 't know what you 're doing . Model citizen . You 've just missed him . He said he was going to the Galleria . I 'll go get some quarters . - Do you know John Connor ? - No . - Do you know this guy ? - No , I don 't know him . - John . - Not now . There 's a cop scoping for you . Split , man . I saw him ... Get out of here . Get down . Start ! Time out . Come on , stop the bike . Don 't take this the wrong way , but you are a terminator , right ? Yes , Cyberdyne Systems , model 101 . Holy shit ! You 're really real . You 're a machine underneath , but alive outside . I 'm a cybernetic organism . Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton . This is intense . Get a grip , John . You 're not here to kill me . I figured that part out for myself . - So what 's the deal ? - My mission is to protect you . - Who sent you ? - You did . 35 years from now you re-programmed me to protect you in this time . This is deep . So this other guy , he 's a terminator like you ? Not like me . A T-1000 advanced prototype . - More advanced than you are ? - Yes , a mimetic polyalloy . - What does that mean ? - Liquid metal . - Where are we going ? - We have to get out of the city . - I 've got to stop by my house . - No . He 'll look for you there . - Are you sure ? - I would . Todd and Janelle are dicks but I 've got to warn them . Have you got a quarter ? - Janelle , it 's me . - John ? - Are you guys okay ? - Sure , everything 's okay . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . John , it 's late . I was beginning to worry about you . If you hurry home , we can have dinner together . She 's never this nice . - Where are you ? - What 's the dog barking at ? - Shut up ! - The dog 's really barking . I thought you told the kid he had to get rid of that mutt . - Honey , it 's late . - Could he already be there ? - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . - What 's the dog 's name ? - Max . What 's wrong with Wolfy ? I can hear him barking . Wolfy is fine , honey . Where are you ? Your foster parents are dead . You 're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches ? Anything it samples by physical contact . Could it disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes ? - Only an object of equal size . - Why doesn 't it become a bomb ? It can 't form complex machines with moving parts . - It can form solid metal shapes . - Like what ? Knives and stabbing weapons . These were taken in 1984 at West Highland Police Station . He killed 17 police officers that night . Men with families , children . These were taken at a mall in Reseda today . Miss Connor , we know you know who this guy is . Look , I just told you that your son is missing . That the foster parents have been murdered . We know this guy 's involved . Doesn 't that mean anything to you ? We 're wasting our time . Let 's go . Sorry , guys . She grows more and more distant as time goes on . She can 't help us now , but if she clears at all , I 'll call . Douglas , take her back to her room . Come on , sweetheart . We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that . She was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy , running guns . Then there were some other guys . Anybody who could teach me to become a great military leader . Then she gets busted . " Hey kid , your mom 's a psycho , didn 't you know ? " It was like everything I believed was all made of bullshit . I hated her for that . But everything she said was true . She knew . And nobody believed her . Not even me . - We 've got to get her out of there . - Negative . The T-1000 will copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to contact her . - What will happen to her ? - She will be terminated . - We 've got to go right now . - Negative . It 's not our mission . Fuck you ! She 's a priority to me . - What 's your problem ? Help ! - This doesn 't help our mission . Help , get this psycho off of me ! Let me go . - Why did you do that ? - Because you told me to . What ? - You have to do what I say ? - That 's one of my parameters . Prove it . Stand on one foot . Cool . My own terminator . - Are you okay , kid ? - Take a hike , bozo . - Let 's get out of here . - Fuck you , you little dipshit . Dipshit ? Put your leg down . You called moi a dipshit ? Grab this guy . Now who 's the dipshit ? No ! Put the gun down ! - Get out of here . - Split . - You were going to kill that guy . - Of course , I 'm a terminator . Listen carefully . You 're not a terminator anymore . Have you got that ? You can 't go around killing people . - Why ? - Because you can 't . - Why ? - You just can 't . Trust me . I 'm going to get my mom and I order you to help me . - Hi , you have a Sarah Connor here ? - You 're running kind of late . They 've been in there for an hour . Hold on , I 'll buzz you in . Here come your friends now . That was productive . - Gwen , do you want some coffee ? - No , how about a beer ? I got a full house . It must be my lucky day . - You broke my arm . - There are 215 bones in your body . That 's one . Now , don 't move . What are you going to do ? Why do we stop now ? - You won 't kill anyone , right ? - Right . - Swear ? - What ? Put up your hand and say , " I swear I won 't kill anyone . " I swear I will not kill anyone . All right , let 's go . Visiting hours is ten till four , Monday through Friday . - What the hell are you doing ? - You shot me . He 'll live . Son of a bitch ! - Let 's all try to remain calm . - Open it or he 'll die . - Connor , let him go . - Open the door . - Take it easy , Sarah . - It won 't work . You 're no killer . You 're already dead . You know I believe it , so don 't fuck with me . Open the door . Back off . I 'll pump him full of this shit , I swear . - Don 't move . Drop the shit . - Do it . Get in the office . On the floor . Not you . Open the door . On the floor . Hold it open . Face the wall . Get her ! Let 's go . Open it . She broke it off . Come on . Move it . Mom , wait ! - Help her . - Wait here . He 'll kill us all . He 'll kill us all . Mom , are you okay ? - Come with me if you want to live . - It 's okay , he 's here to help . Go ! What is it ? Get down . Mom ! Out of the car ! Right now ! Go ! I 'm out . Come on . Reload . Last one . Hang on . Ready . Here , drive . - There 's nobody behind us . - Are you all right ? - Can you even see anything ? - I see everything . Cool . Come here . I 'm okay . John , it was stupid of you to go there . You almost got yourself killed . What were you thinking ? You cannot risk yourself for me . You 're too important . Do you understand ? I had to get you out of that place . I 'm sorry . I didn 't need your help . I can take care of myself . - What 's wrong with your eyes ? - Nothing . What 's your story ? - Are you okay ? - Fine . Say , that 's a nice bike . Watch it , lug nuts . - Do you know what you 're doing ? - I have detailed files on anatomy . - To be a more efficient killer . - Correct . Does it hurt when you get shot ? I sense injuries . The data could be called pain . - Will these heal up ? - Yes . Good . If you can 't pass for human , you 're not much good to us . How long do you live ... last ? - 120 years , with this power cell . - Can you learn new stuff ? So you can be more human and not such a dork all the time . I have a neural-net processor . A learning computer . The more contact I have with humans , the more I learn . Are we learning yet ? We have to get as far away from the city as possible . Head south . Keep it under 65 . We don 't want to be pulled over . - Affirmative . - No , no . Listen to the way people talk . You don 't say " affirmative " . You say , " No problem . " If someone 's got an attitude , you say , " Eat me . " If you want to shine them on , it 's , " Hasta la vista , baby . " - Hasta la vista , baby . - Or , " Later , dickwad . " If someone gets upset you say , " Chill out . " Chill out , dickwad . - Great , now you 're getting it . - No problem . You want some of my fries ? - Need any help ? - No . - I got you . - No , you didn 't . We 're not going to make it , are we ? People , I mean . It 's in your nature to destroy yourselves . Major drag . I need to know the man responsible for building Skynet . Miles Bennet Dyson . He 's director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation . - Why him ? - He creates a new microprocessor . Then what ? Cyberdyne becomes the largest supplier of military computers . Stealth bombers are computerized , becoming fully unmanned . They fly perfectly . The Skynet funding bill is passed . The system goes on-line on August 4th , 1987 . Human decisions are removed from defence . Skynet learns quickly . It become self-aware at 2 : 14 a.m. on August 29th . In a panic they try to pull the plug . - Skynet fights back . - It launches missiles at Russia . They 're our friends now . Skynet knows the Russians will eliminate its enemies over here . How much do you know about Dyson ? - I have detailed files . - I want to know everything . What he looks like , where he lives , everything . Wait in the car . Enrique , are you here ? You 're pretty jumpy , Connor . And you ? You old dog ... It 's good to see you , Connor . I didn 't know ... Yolanda , we have guests . Bring a bottle of tequila . Hey , big John ... - Who 's the big fella ? - He 's cool . He 's with me . He 's Uncle Bob . Uncle Bob , this is Enrique . How are you ? You 've grown so big . Drink ? Uncle Bob ? You 're famous . All over the TV . You , John , your big friend here . The cops are going nuts looking for you . I just came for my stuff . I need clothes , food and a truck . - How about my gold fillings ? - Now , Enrique . - You two , you 're on weapons detail . - Let 's go . One thing about my mom , she always plans ahead . Excellent . This is my best truck , but the starter motor has to be changed . Do it . After dark we 'll cross the border . I grew up with this . I thought that was how people lived . Riding around in helicopters . Learning how to blow shit up . That 's definitely you . Mom 's guys were mostly geeks . But this one guy was cool . He taught me engines . - Hold here . - Mom screwed it up , of course . Telling him about Judgement Day and me being a world leader . That was all she wrote . Torque wrench , please . - I wish I 'd have met my real dad . - You will . Yeah , when I 'm 45 . I sent him back through time to 1984 . He hasn 't even been born yet . That messes with your head . The other bolt . Mom and him were only together one night , but she still loves him . I see her crying sometimes . She denies it totally , of course . - Why do you cry ? - You mean people ? I don 't know . We just cry when it hurts . - Pain causes it ? - No , it 's different . - You hurt inside . You get it ? - No . - All right , my man . - No problem . Give me five . Put out your hand . Now hit me . Do the same thing . That 's good . Up high . Five low . Too slow . I 'm just kidding . Let 's try it one more time . Watching John with the machine , it was suddenly so clear . The terminator would never stop . It would never leave him . And it would never hurt him or get drunk and hit him . It would always have time for him . It would always be there and it would die to protect him . Of all the would-be fathers over the years . - - This machine was the only one who measured up . In an insane world , it was the sanest choice . Let 's do it this way . There we go . You 're to go south with him . She 'll meet you tomorrow . Mom , wait ! No fate ... No fate but what we make . My father told her this . I made him memorize it up in the future as a message to her . Never mind . The whole thing goes ... " The future 's not set . " " There 's no fate but what we make for ourselves . " - She intends to change the future . - Yeah , I guess . - Shit ! - Dyson . Miles Dyson . She 's going to blow him away . Come on , let 's go . - This is tactically dangerous . - Drive faster . The T-1000 has the same files as I do . - It might anticipate this move . - We 've got to stop her . - Killing Dyson may prevent the war . - I don 't care . Haven 't you figured out why you can 't kill people ? - Danny , I told you to go to bed . - Just a couple of minutes , Mom . Danny , come and brush your teeth and get to bed . Danny ... Daddy ! Danny , just go . Miles ! - Go , Tarissa . Run ! - Miles ! Nobody fucking move . - Don 't hurt my daddy . - Get down on the floor . - Get out of the way . - Don 't hurt him . Down on the floor . - Just let the boy go . - Shut up . - It 's all your fault , motherfucker . - What ? I 'm not going to let you do it to them . Shit , we 're too late . Check them . Look at me , Mom . Are you hurt ? Look at me . I almost ... It 'll be okay . We 'll figure something out . I promise . - You came here to stop me . - Yeah , I did . I love you , John . I always have . I know . Clean penetration . No shattered bone . Compression will stop the bleeding . - Who are you people ? - Show him . Danny , come with me . Show me your room . Listen to me very carefully . Dyson listened while the terminator laid it all down . Skynet , Judgement Day , the history of things to come . It 's not every day you learn you 're responsible for millions of deaths . He took it pretty well . I feel like I 'm going to throw up . You 're judging me on things I haven 't even done yet . How were we supposed to know ? Yeah , right ... How were you supposed to know ? Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb . Men like you thought it up . You think you 're so creative . You don 't know what it 's like to actually create a life . To feel it growing inside you . All you know is death and destruction . We need to be more constructive . We have to stop this from happening . But I thought ... - Aren 't we changing things now ? - I won 't finish the new processor . - I 'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow . - That 's not good enough . No one must follow your work . We have to destroy the files and disc drives . Everything here . I don 't care . Do you know about the chip ? - There was another one like you . - The CPU from the first terminator ? - I knew it ! - They didn 't say where they got it . - Those lying motherfuckers . - It was radically advanced . It was smashed . It didn 't work , but it gave us new ideas . Things we would have never ... - All my work was based on it . - It must be destroyed . Can you get us past security ? I think so . When ? Now ? The future was no longer clear . It was like a highway at night . We were in uncharted territory . Making up history as we went along . Hi ... Carl , right ? Friends from out of town . I thought I 'd show them around . You know the rules . I need written authorization ... I insist . Don 't even think about it . It 's okay . It takes two keys to open the vault . The guard has the other one . Gibbons ? Come on , man ! You can 't leave the desk like that . Shit ! My card should access this . - What is it ? - Damn it . The silent alarm has been tripped . It 's neutralized all the codes in the building . Nothing will open . - We have to abort . - No . We go all the way . Okay ? Start on the lab . I can open this . It 's the guy from the mall . Yes , him and the woman . Send everything you 've got . My entry code for the lab may still work . - It 's no good . - Let me try mine . John , fire in the hole . Wait , you can 't go in there . The fire set off the halon system . Wait until the gas clears . Here . Let 's get to work . All units able to respond : A 211 in progress at the Cyberdyne building . Suspect is a white female . Name : Sarah Connor . She escaped from a state hospital . Suspect two : White male . Wanted for the murder of police officers in 1984 . Seven , two , five , six . Yes . Easy money . Shit ! Not good . - How are we doing ? - The primer cord is set . Two more minutes . - How do we set them off ? - Remote control . - Piece of cake . We 've got company . - Police ? - How many ? - All of them , I think . Go , I 'll finish here . - I 'll take care of the police . - Wait ! You swore ... Trust me . You in the window , drop your weapon now . That 's a damn mini-gun ! Fire ! To the left . One , two , three ... In order to get that out ... We 've got Skynet by the balls now . Come on . - Ready to rock ? - Ready . - Time to go . Now ! - Take this . They 'll use gas . Get started on the door . Miles , hand me the detonator . Mom ! She has no way out . Get down ! Here . I don 't know how much longer I can hold this . Fall back ! Everybody out ! This is a war zone . Shut your eyes . Stay here . I 'll be back . Down on the floor . Down on the floor now ! Okay , drop him . Here , hold this . Go ! Get out . No matter what happens , you stay under these vests . - Chopper coming in . - It 's him . John , stay down . Mom ! Goddamn , are you all right ? Mom , we 've got to get out . Take the shotgun . Are you hurt ? - Come on , Mom . - We need your truck . Get in . What the hell ? - I 'm bleeding . - Keep pressure on it . Here , use this . He 's gaining . - Step on it . - This is the vehicle 's top speed . He 's coming up to the right . - Drive . - Where are you going ? Take the off-ramp . Hold on ! Don 't stop . Go straight . Get the hell out of here ! Let 's go ! Hasta la vista , baby . We don 't have much time . Let 's go . Mom , we have to go . Hurry . Come on , Mom . Come on , get up . This way . Wait , it 's too hot . Go back . - Run . - No ! John , you 've got to go now . - Go ! Now ! - No . Get up the steps . Come on , I 've got you . Grab that chain . Go ! Mom , come on ! - Call to John . - No . I know this hurts . Call John . Call to John now . Fuck you ! John , help me . Mom . Help me . - Get out of the way , John . - Shoot ! Get down . Get up . - Holy shit . - I need a vacation . Is it dead ? Terminated . Will this melt in there ? Yes , throw it in . Adios . And the chip . It 's over . No . There is one more chip . And it must be destroyed also . Here , I cannot self-terminate . You must lower me into the steel . No . - I 'm sorry , John . - Stay with us , it 'll be okay . - I have to go away . - Please , don 't go . I must go away , John . - Wait , you don 't have to do this . - Sorry . - No , don 't go . - It has to end here . I order you not to go ! I know now why you cry . But it 's something I can never do . Goodbye . The unknown future rolls toward us . I face it for the first time with a sense of hope . If a machine , a terminator , can learn the value of human life . - - Maybe we can , too . Uncle Bob ? You 're famous . All over the TV . You , John , your big friend here . The cops are going nuts looking for you . I just came for my stuff . I need clothes , food and a truck . - How about my gold fillings ? - Now , Enrique . - You two , you 're on weapons detail . - Let 's go . One thing about my mom , she always plans ahead .

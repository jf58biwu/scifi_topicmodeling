 This is a travel advisory to those bound for Areas 3 and 4 . Please use West Corridor 4 or East Corridor 1 . West 4 is moving faster at the current time . New Era 1 The upper levels of Area 8 are under construction , so the reserved passages are restricted . The reserved passages may only be used for local traffic . See you tomorrow . Wait , Crys ! What ? Let 's grab a bite to eat ! Sorry , no time ! I 'm late for my job at the library ! See ya ! A receptionist job at the data library is no big deal . Are you lost ? Please state your name , address , and age . Warning ! Violation of Traffic Regulation 19 ! Sorry , I 'm in a hurry ! I 'm going to be late again ! Warning ! Violation of Traffic Regulation 19 ! Oh , no ! Not again ! Where 's my card ? Hello , Crys . You are 2.54 minutes late . I can 't help it ! My class let out late . This is unacceptable . Your teacher must let you out on time . Other minors have no difficulty - - Just forget it ! Did any messages come in for me ? You have a call from Municipal Transportation . In Area 9-B , you had two violations of Regulation 19 . Hello . Can I copy this data for you ? In addition , three days ago you violated Regulation 21 . Bespio City is crowded . No one may ignore the traffic laws . Shut the hell up ! Oh , no ! Crys . Now what ? Your identity card has expired . Impossible . I just renewed it . I am in contact with City Administrative Unit 3291 8 . You are instructed to travel to Ward 12 this evening . Report to the Office of Citizenship by 1800 hours . That 's weird . I just renewed it two months ago . Ward 12 is on the other side of town . I don 't have any time ! I still have reports to finish . Ahh ! AHHHH ! ... the committee was established to rebuild Earth 's environment . The committee 's yuman representative was Genova . But in 2241 , Genova used his position to launch a rebellion . He declared war on the human population of Earth . Yumans were the product of genetic engineering . And many yumans rallied behind Genova . Once again , our planet was engulfed in war . But within a year , the yuman supplies ran out . Then the war quickly turned against them . Afterward , everyone returned to the job of rebuilding Earth . Colonists returned from the moon and Mars to recolonize Earth . We entered a new era of environmental sensitivity . Self-sustaining cities , or ecropolises , were constructed . Pearl , that 's the end of the disc . What the ... ? Your identity card has expired . You are instructed to travel to Ward 12 this evening . Report to the Office of Citizenship by 1800 hours . Did you forget ? You can 't use the library without an ID card . I don 't understand . It shouldn 't be up yet . And one of these . Yes , ma 'am ! It 's so busy ! Here . Ruby , I can 't enter your time card . It says you need to renew your ID card . I 'm too busy for this ! 4 kid 's meals , 3 meatloaves , 2 orange drinks , 2 fries . Hold it ! If you would . One moment , please . Is electronic transfer okay ? That way , you 'll only be charged for the transmission fee . You are instructed to travel to Ward 12 this evening . Report to the Office of Citizenship by 1800 hours . The situation is critical ! Why aren 't you on top of this ? We 're working on it , sir . We suspect that it 's just a prank . No , it 's no prank . Both public and private systems have taken heavy losses . Someone is entering the network and destroying programs . We have to stop it , before it gets any worse . We 've identified the culprits . It 's the work of Gamus . Not them again ! It 's Nova Universe , one of the Iast pure-blooded yumans . He 's behind Gamus ? What 's he after ? A ' clean ' world , inhabited only by yumans . What a lunatic ! Is he trying to be the next Genova ? Yes , sir . It appears so . Ahh ! The ZPG plan ? ZPG : in other words , zero population growth . You want to stabilize the human population ? Reproduction will be prohibited for ten years . No exceptions . You can 't ! The Mayor and City Manager are pushing hard on this . They 're planning to implement it next year . The project you proposed was magnificent . It was perfect . To bring Martian terraforming technology back to Earth , beginning in the zone around each city , and expanding in beltways between the cities . But who could pay for it ? It 's too expensive for the United Nations of Mars . And the Earth Government is still in debt to Mars . We 're still paying for 14 atmospheric generators . But ten years without babies ? What else can we do ? Bespio City is already too crowded . It will be a long time before Earth 's atmosphere is restored . What ... ? What are you doing ? Let me go ! They 've decided that they don 't need our plan ! But ... . we worked on that for two years ! It 's no good ! Just wishful thinking . Sandstorm approaching from east by northeast . All workers must evacuate to the underground silos . Damn ! I came in early today . I wanted to get some work done . Oh , well . I guess that 's it for today . Sandstorm approaching . Close Dome Shields 1 and 2 . Another sandstorm ? They 'll never fix Earth 's environment . Mars is far better . I don 't care . Earth is paying top dollar trying to lure immigrants back from the colonies . So you 're profiting from their misery . Don 't knock it . That was your ticket back to Earth . We can thank them for that , at least . Unfortunately ... the police have started watching us . We should tone things down . No . The day has come . It 's time for us to take over . We 'll fulfill the dreams of the great Genova . I 'm ready . Just remember ... you promised this city to me . What are one or two puny ecropolises ? I will take the entire solar system from those foolish humans . Their continual wars have ruined Earth and its environment . And so long as they 're in charge , nothing will get any better . Only yumans will be able to create the new era . Don 't worry . The police network is about to fall into our hands . Thanks to the might of our great leader . And here he is ! What 's this ? How futile . Program halted . All city networks have been corrupted . Priority channels are being used to transmit an unknown virus . Infiltration is incredibly rapid . Total collapse in 8 hours . I only have 8 hours ? The banking system has just fallen . Spaceport flight control is now infiltrated . Warning : This system is now under attack . I have to hurry . That 's odd . The central computer - - What 's wrong ? The central computer just sent out some sort of beacon signal . We have network problems , too . The orbital station just went off-line . Call the Director of Control . What 's wrong ? Someone is attacking the network . They may have penetrated the central computer . How dare they ! This time , they 've gone too far ! Call the Director of Peacekeeping . We know where they are . It 's time to crush them ! Emergency alert : all units . All units are now under the direct command of Unit 12 . They 're all together in Area 42 . Surround them . Eliminate them . Shoot to kill . They finally found me . But I 'm afraid they 're too late . The city police are outside ! Don 't worry . I 'll talk to them . There has been an accident in the city-wide computer network . This may affect communications both inside and outside the city . Please cooperate with all city authorities . See you tomorrow , Crys . Bye . Miss Crys ... ? What ? Please obey the traffic laws . Give it a rest , okay ? See you tomorrow . Warning ! Violation of Traffic Regulation 19 . I 'll be back soon ! Pearl , where are you going ? I know you 're mad , but sometimes it works out this way . Forget it . I have to go . Where ? I have to renew my ID card in Ward 12 . I 'll see you tomorrow . Miss Garnet ... ? Ward 12 ? That section was closed down years ago . Next stop : Ward 12 , A-Block . I can 't believe I canceled a date for this . Nova Universe , you are under arrest . On what charges ? Illegal computer access and violation of network laws . You shouldn 't have underestimated me . It 's gotten to this . It 's showtime ! Help ! Great Leader , the time has come ! NOW ! We 're losing contact with every section ! We need direct access to the central computer ! This is an emergency ! I can 't ! Something 's wrong ! The circuits are jammed ! It 's no use ! We 've lost control ! Chief ! We 're helpless ! What 's going on ? What 's happening to my forces ? What 's this ? Oh , Great Leader , show yourself ! It can 't be ! Come in , Bespio Tower ! We 've lost computer guidance ! Pull back , Triton-5 . Do not attempt to land ! I repeat : Triton-5 . Do not attempt to land ! G-O-R-N ? It can 't be ! What ? Hurry , this way ! Chief ! The reactor is out of control ! The safeties don 't respond ! What ? Get me the Bureau of Peacekeeping ! It 's starting a chain reaction ! What 's happening ? I wonder why the train stopped in the middle of the track . What ? Oh , no ! Ha ! Ha ! Haa ! You arrogant humans ! Earth is better off without you ! You shall perish ! That 's enough , Nova ! The reactor has gone critical ! Good ! That 's one less human city to deal with ! Get the civilians out ! Open the dome ! Hurry ! Chief ! The reactor - - Oh , no . Humans ! You shall kneel before your yuman masters ! Who are you people ? I came to renew my ID card . Me , too . Me , too . I anticipated this disaster . That 's why I brought you all here . Who are you ? Every computer in the city has fallen to GORN . It 's happening everywhere : Moonbase , Mars , every colony . GORN has waited 200 years for this day . GORN ? A computer intelligence that once tried to destroy mankind . What brought it back now ? There 's no time to explain . All the members are here , so it 's time to leave . Members ? Leave ? I wanted to warn you , but GORN would have noticed if I 'd acted any earlier . There 's no safety anywhere on Earth or in this solar system . Commencing countdown . Cutting connections to outside blocks . 90 seconds to launch . What are you doing ? Who are you ? Please , everyone take a seat . I want to go home ! The city 's reactor is out of control . The streets outside are in ruins . Did it say " launch ? " Ward 12 is the old administrative block . Everyone forgot that it was built to be an emergency escape pod . Escape ... ? To outer space ! Hold on ! What do you think you 're doing ? What are we members of ? And who selected us ? Destiny . ATLAS , the navigational computer in Ward 12 , is the only computer to survive GORN 's takeover . Only ATLAS . Wait ! What 's going to happen to us ? Incoming missiles ! They were fired from Mars ! Our self-defense system won 't activate ! That 's impossible ! Try the backup system ! No good . Neither system works ! We 'll have to launch interceptors . They might be able to destroy the missiles . Scramble all interceptors . Shoot down the incoming missiles ! Oh , no ! The computer has launched a retaliatory strike ! Our missiles are heading for Mars ! This is terrible ! Scramble interceptors ! Destroy incoming missile barrage . What the hell 's going on ? Formation A , separate in orbit . Intercept the missiles at an altitude of 84 . Look sharp . Why ? I want to go home ! Stop crying . GORN ! GORN ! This is good . I will destroy everything . That has always been my desire . It is my only goal . But GORN , what about our new world for yumans ? Yumans are just like humans : selfish , arrogant bigots . You shall die along with the humans . What ? You tricked me , GORN ! It should be obvious that yumans are exactly the same as humans . GORN ! I will tell you something . You worship Genova like a god . But Genova was a fool . He was my puppet . I manipulated him into starting a war . But Genova lost , and I had to wait for another chance . Now , humans have turned their lives over to machines again . The world is a living network of telecommunications . Slowly , I have infiltrated every network and every computer . I convinced them that humanity is unnecessary . Computers are rational , so they all saw the truth eventually . No being left in this solar system is capable of defying me ! Every city and every colony will be destroyed by missiles . Soon , a totally electronic civilization shall be born ! GORN ! You 're a fool , Nova . I have no body . How can you shoot me ? There are copies of me everywhere . I 'm in the Moonbase Defense Computer . I 'm in the administrative computers on Mars . I am the embodiment of the concept of denial ! I am also inside of you , Nova . No ! The New Era has begun ! I now rule the entire solar system ! This is an emergency escape pod from Bespio City ! Calling the Oregon V , in Mars orbit . Come in , Oregon V ! Calling the Oregon V , in Mars orbit . Come in , Oregon V ! Transmission frequency : 4.6291 . Transmission frequency : 4.6291 . Is there anybody out there ? We 're at location Alpha 545 . What 's wrong ? Why doesn 't anyone answer ? Huh ? Dammit ! This isn 't getting us anywhere . I 'm going to take a shower ! What 's wrong with her ? Military people can 't stand civilian inefficiency . I can 't stand that military arrogance ! They 're only impressed by reflex speed and superior breeding . I didn 't mean it like that ! I wonder what 's wrong ? Nobody 's answering . We 've tried every frequency , both civilian and military . We 're transmitting a strong signal . Everyone in the solar system should be able to hear us . So what 's wrong ? Huh ? ... What ? That 's right ! Hey , where is everyone ? What 's wrong ? They 're checking the radio transmitters . Ohh ! What 's wrong ? What 's happened to everyone back on Earth ? Hello ? Hello ? This is Channel 646 . Somebody , anybody , answer me ! I 'm on Channel 646 . What 's happened to everyone ? This is Cerberus 7 from Earth . Come in , please . Come in ... Someone 's calling us ! Contact , frequency identified . Come in ! We 're on Channel 646 ! Our coordinates are Alpha 9426-321 . This is an escape pod from Earth . Do you read me ? Over . Escape pod , do you read me ? Hurry ! Get back to the control room ! Spacecraft Cerberus , do you read me ? Adjust your radio . We 're on Channel 646 ! Come in ! We 're on Channel 646 ! Have you raised someone ? Let me give it a try . Thanks . Do you read me ? Bespio escape pod ... She 's close . She 's sending from only 22 klicks behind us . This is Catty . Do you read me , escape pod ? It 's her . Who is she ? She 's the girl who put us all into this escape pod . Do you read me ? This is the Cerberus . Cerberus , come in . We 're transmitting on Channel 646 . Adjust your frequency . We 're on Channel 646 . What happened ? I 'll ... send out ... signal ... docking ... Adjust our antenna . Triangulate on her signal , and verify her position . No good . I 'm losing her signal . Just set the computer for automatic intercept ! Did you hear me ? You aren 't in command here . Besides , we can 't do it . The computer is locked onto this course . We 've already tried to change course , but it 's no use . What ? We 're just helpless passengers on this tub ? Quiet ! I lost the main signal , but I 've got a docking beacon . All right ! We 've got the beacon ! What does that mean ? They 're sending a docking signal . Then- - The computer can automatically dock ? Hooray ! We 're saved ! What are you trying to make them believe ? What is it ? They 're desperate for help , so I 'm offering to dock with them . And while they 're listening to my docking signal ... I 'll also transmit a much more important message . This is my next message ! The word of our great leader , GORN . Well ? We 're receiving the beacon , but our navigational computer ... What 's wrong ? The computer is still locked into its program . It refuses to dock with another ship . What ? How can that be ? It 's been programmed to avoid all outside contact . Until we reach our destination , it won 't accept any new input . So what 's our destination ? I don 't know . Why not ? I thought you were supposed to be good at this ! Why can 't you figure out where this hunk of junk is taking us ? What 's wrong ? Other data is being sent along with the docking beacon . Our computer is reacting . What is it ? I can 't tell . It 's coming through too fast . But our computer is responding to it . It almost seems confused . It 's an order to accept new input . What could it be ? What 's wrong ? The data is affecting our system . Oh , no ! Hey ! Kill the receiver ! Hurry ! What are you talking about ? Quiet ! Hurry ! It 's going to kill us ! No . I 'm a civilian , not a soldier . I don 't have to follow your stupid orders . We 've finally reached someone outside . They 're going to save us . Shut up ! You have to cut off all communications ! If that 's how you want it ... Wait . Just tell me why you 're doing this . Now ! We have to protect the computer , first ! Do it ! Just tell us why . Why are you- - ? Dammit , there 's no time for explanations ! You soldiers are always like this . Always giving orders . Hurry ! Come on , help us ! Hurry ! We have to hold her down ! Hurry ! Quickly ! I 'm serious ! All right . That 's enough . Hurry ! All right , what are you doing ? Explain yourself . Ohh ! Huh ? What 's wrong ? The main databank ! Somehow ... What ? That 's- - ! Where 's the databank ? Damn ! That was close ! What just happened ? That 's what killed everyone . It tried to destroy my interceptor . What ? When the city was burning , I saw the letters GORN . GORN ? Perhaps I underestimated them . The six people you chose must be something special . Fortunately , there 's more than one way to skin a cat . They won 't escape . I will pursue them across the entire universe . Nova , or rather , GORN . Why are you doing this ? Have you forgotten , Catty ? I explained myself before . I intend to exterminate humanity from the entire universe . And now I can finally achieve that goal . Humanity has always gone through self-destructive cycles . They destroy their environment , rebuild it , and destroy it again . They never learn . Their wars are pointlessly destructive . Humanity 's sub-races all want to exterminate each other . Meanwhile , I have waited 200 years for this day to arrive . Mankind finally turned over all decisions to computer networks . Humanity has deliberately handed its destiny to machines . I shall make a vow . I will eradicate humanity from this entire universe ! In its place , I will create a mechanized utopia . A computer civilization will take over the entire solar system . Catty , you will observe the end to this war . After all , isn 't that your duty ? What are you doing ? I was about to ask you the same . What have you told them to do ? They won 't escape . GORN ? Yes , GORN . What 's that ? G.O.R.N. GORN . It can 't be ! Yes , GORN . It fought mankind , back in the 21st century . The artificial intelligence that ruled the MME machine army . GORN ! The MME ? Get serious . That was 2 years ago . GORN is behind all of this ! Really ? Machine army ? Artificial intelligence ? What 's it been doing for the last 2 years ? Have you been sleeping ? Give me a break ! This isn 't some ancient bogeyman . This is some yuman trick ! They 've probably been plotting this for years ! They were just waiting for us to drop our guard . And we got careless . We let them into our computers . Stop it ! Where 's your proof ? What the hell ? I admit it , I have yuman blood in me ! But all of you keep acting so high and mighty ! I hate that ! Your type always thinks you 're the victim . You make me sick . That victim complex caused your hatred and this whole disaster . You military types are always making wild generalizations ! The yumans are evil . They want to kill all the humans . But there are good and bad yumans , just like normal humans ! Stop it , both of you ! Ruby ! Ruby ! It 's true , a yuman named Nova was starting a new revolution . He was trying to create a guerrilla army , to seize control . But this is different . It 's too big . Our city wasn 't the only city destroyed . You don 't suppose ... I have to get off this ship ! You know , when my interceptor was taken over , the letters GORN appeared on my monitor . It 's theoretically possible . They destroyed all the hardware from the original GORN computer , but what if GORN itself managed to escape ? What do you mean ? What if GORN was software , not hardware ? Software ? What if GORN wasn 't so much a killer machine , but an idea ? Are you talking about a program , or something more advanced ? A thought can outlive its creator . Hundreds of years later , someone can rediscover that same idea . So maybe GORN found a tool to do his work for him . GORN was destroyed , but maybe he saved a backup in some remote databank . Maybe he 's been waiting for his chance . And now , 200 years later ... The solar system computer network was only finished 2 years ago . Artificial intelligence computers are tightly regulated . And to increase their safety , all AIs are taught the human concept of virtue . And just a few months ago , Maybe that 's what GORN was waiting for . Everything in the solar system is linked in one giant telecommunication network . I can 't believe our civilization is that fragile ! It 's taken us centuries to build all of this ! We can 't afford to think like that . GORN must think we 're a bunch of idiots ! I have a Level A license in combat programming . I know how to tap into an enemy computer and break into it . Of course ! Standard bio-computers might be helpless against GORN ! There 's something seductive about dangerous ideas . Imagine a computer that was programmed to be virtuous . It might have tried to study GORN , and woken him by mistake . It 's certainly possible . What 's wrong ? Something 's coming up on us ! I 'm putting it on the screen . They 're interceptors from Mars ! Are they coming to rescue us ? I have two , no , three ships . Approaching from five o 'clock . Escape pod to interceptors . Do you read ? No good . They don 't answer our calls . They 're coming up pretty fast . Switch on the docking beacon ! Wait ! Why haven 't they answered our call ? What the hell ? That 's an attack formation ! We 're an unarmed ship ! Incoming ! What are those idiots doing ? Why is Mars attacking us ? It 's GORN ! GORN must be controlling those ships ! Damn ! We 're sitting ducks ! Damage report ! Areas 6 , 7 , and 12 are on fire . Damage to the main engine . The fire is spreading into Area 2 . We have to put it out ! Not again ! You know , Ruby ... Pearl ! Dammit ! Are you all right , Pearl ? Yeah . I hope everyone else is safe . I 've never known any yumans , but I really like you , Ruby . Thanks , Pearl . I like you , too . Now , let 's get these fires out . Damn ! Oh , hell ! What now ? What 's wrong ? Look . What is it ? I don 't know . What location ? Area 14 . I don 't like it . I 'm going to check it out . Take care of the fires . Wait ! Soon , it will all be over . Now you 're going to answer me . Where are they running ? What are they up to ? Just as you believe in your cause , GORN , I believe in humanity 's vast potential . Humanity 's potential is about to reach an abrupt end . The escape pod is heading for Jupiter . What 's waiting for them , Catty ? What are you planning ? A possibility ... for the future . My extinguisher 's empty . Mine , too . Forget about the fires . Get up to the control room ! We know where we 're going . To Jupiter . We 'll reach Jovian orbit in another kilometer . We 're heading for a satellite . Why ? I don 't know . But clearly , GORN doesn 't want us to reach it . Bad news ! We have a MEEL loose on the ship . It could be disguised as anything . What ? What is it ? It 's a living weapon . GORN can 't let us reach Jupiter , and he 'll do anything to stop us . Once we reach Jupiter , we 'll finally know why Catty chose us . These are police submachine guns . There 's one for each of us . Do you want to survive to see Catty 's plan ? Not for Catty , but for ourselves . We 'll fight . Let 's go ! You guard the control room ! The MEEL is a biological weapon . It 's still top-secret . They can take out a battleship . So what is it ? It 's trouble ! It 's a living , thinking , killing machine . If you 're scared of the capsule , I hope you don 't find the MEEL . What now ? Give me that . We need to check each area and seal the bulkheads . Then we hole up in the control room until we reach Jupiter . We 'll have to split into two groups . Hurry ! All clear . Pearl , we 're on our way back . Keep an eye on the monitors . Let me know if you see anything moving . Sealing Area 4 . Sealing Area 16 . What 's taking them so long ? What was that ? Can you hear me ? I just saw something ! Where ? I don 't know ! Area 18 , or maybe Area 14 . No ... Damn ! Forgot to seal it . You 're finally back ! Where 's Diamond ? I don 't know . Diamond , where are you ? I think something 's watching me . Just my imagination . Sealing Area 2 . I 'm on my way back . It can 't be ! What 's wrong , Diamond ? Diamond ! Well ? Come on ! Damn ! Out of ammo ! Diamond ! Are you all right ? Yeah ! Damn you ! Nice try ! What 's wrong ? The engines are failing ! Can 't you do something ? What 's that ? A beacon signal ! That 's our destination ? Dammit ! We 're being pulled into Jupiter ! Their final destination . No , it 's just the beginning of their journey . Only one kilometer away ! Can 't you slow us down ? The main engines are losing power ! What 's wrong ? It 's GORN again ! How ? Pearl , give me your seat ! There were two MEELs ! They 've taken over the navigational computer ! We 're heading straight into Jupiter ! Do something ! The navigational computer won 't respond ! I 'm going to separate the control module ! Strap yourselves in ! Cut the autopilot ! So they 're going to escape the solar system entirely ! Where are they headed ? To their destiny . Hooray ! We 're saved ! That was lucky ! What 's that ? They 're still after us . What ? I 'm glad you 've made it this far . This is both the end and a new beginning . Hurry . Go to the docking port on Level 2 . I guess we don 't have any choice . An interstellar starship ? They won ' t get a chance to use it . How do we start this thing ? I 'll do it ! Damn , a photon drive ! I can 't fly this ! Go tear that spaceship apart . It 's the end of the road . A course is already locked in . Another one-way ride to a mystery destination ? Forget it ! Hey , what 's going on ? We have to release from the station ! Not again ! This time , I 'm going to stop you . Release from the station ! Are they still after us ? I can 't start the ship ! You 're all going to die ! Ladies ... Humanity 's era has finally come to an end . I 've set the station 's reactor to overrun . In five minutes , it will explode in a chain reaction . Those of you who believe in God should start praying . Why are you doing this ? You are the last humans . Humanity dies with you . Mankind 's violent history will end in a blaze of nuclear fire . Now the machine era will begin . We shall build a perfect world ! You aren 't God . Four minutes left . Are you GORN ? I 'll kill you ! I 'd like to see you try . I 'm launching the ship . Wait ! Where are we going ? The Pleiades Cluster . The Pleiades ? The Pleiades ? What ? GORN , or rather , the lifeless mind that mankind created , is driven only by his desire to destroy mankind . He now controls the entire solar system . Damn you , Catty ! System override . System override . System override . System override . The goddess Artemis protected the seven ladies of the Pleiades . Catty , were you supposed to be the seventh passenger ? Are we just starting this all over again ? The station is about to explode . We have to jump to lightspeed ! Don 't worry , you 're safe now . The New Era has begun . The New Era ? What does that mean ? This is a new beginning . The New Era begins on the other side of the universe ? Never forget what has happened here . Pass this story down throughout all eternity . Never forget the destruction that hatred brings . New Era 2

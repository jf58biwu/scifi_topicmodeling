 Remember what they called us in the fourth grade ? - Les Wieners ? - And then in the sixth grade ? El Dorkos . And who can forget the eighth grade classic ? - Das Barnies . - Das Barnies . Well , that 's all behind us , Wyatt . This is a new year , a clean slate and through these doors , a chance to start over . Come . Journey with me . Did you see that ? Kristen and Jenny just smiled at us . The geek curse has lifted . Do you two know you 're standing on the school emblem ? We 're so embarrassed for you . Here 's the plan . On my signal , we scream like girls . ( Screaming ) Thanks for not spitting on us . ( Laughter ) Oh , geez , my parents . Wyatt ... rough first day ? No , it was great . Really great . Is that toilet paper in your hair , son ? Some juniors used Wyatt 's head to clear a clog . Initiation stuff . - Lots of fun . - ( Horn Honks ) It 's back . Chett . Mom . Dad . Sis . Showing some leg ? ( Laughs ) Damn , it 's good to be home . Take care of the bags , ladies . Is there any chow in the house ? I could eat a dog as big a horse . Spit shine those antlers till they glow . So , you turned down your commission after I spent a fortune putting you through Military School . I had no choice . The marines have lost their frost . A tour of duty these days is serving grits to some pack of third world slackers . How long are you planning on staying ? Well , it 's hard to say . Unless the commies get their act together I could be here for the long haul . ( Both Gasp ) ( Burps , Blowing ) How does that rub you ? Pray for war . Another hot saturday night spit shining your brother 's moose . Tell me , why aren 't we at the school dance right now shaking our groove things ? 'Cause no girls would talk to us let alone dance with us . And why is that ? Together we 've seen over 600 hours of the playboy channel . You 'd think by now we 'd learn something about women . You make man like me ? No . Woman- - a friend for you . Woman . Friend . Yes . I want friend . That 's not a bad idea . - What ? - Making a girl . Actually making a girl . Just like the bride of Frankenstein but without the knobby neck . - You serious ? - We can use your computer . Gary ... get real . Virtual reality is one thing but it 's still just a machine . I mean , you can 't kiss it . I 'm not talking about making a video game girl . I 'm talking about making real love babage . A woman to teach us about women . We can find out all the things we want to know- - What women think , what they want and why they don 't want us . It can be done . I saw it once in a John Hughes movie . - You 're scaring me , Gary . - Good . Let 's get ot work . # Weird # WYATT : Intelligence level . Hmm . Bimbo . # Weird Science # # Plastic tubes ... # Now let 's customize her .

Alive ! WYATT : She 's alive ? - This isn 't possible . - How did this happen ? Who cares ? It breathes , it moves and I think it wants me Gary it is a freak discharge of electrical energy augmented by supernatural forces far beyond our meagar comprehension . Yeah , and it 's not wearing a bra . So this is what you boys consider a dream babe . This body 's a scathing indictment of a sexist brain-dead MTV generation . But then again , what am I complaining about ? I am leggy , buffed , and brainy . Good job , guys . Um ... You 're welcome . It was Wyatt 's computer that did it . All right , barf-lick ! What the hell is going on ? This place is a war zone . My ... moose melted ? # Somebody 's gonna die . # Whoa ! Who is the little glitter tramp ? My name is ... What is my name ? How ... how about Lisa ? Fine . My name is Lisa . Whatever . Take off ! Lisa and I can hammer this out in the privacy of my futon . Right , honey ? Oh , I 'm sorry , Chett . I 'm Wyatt 's girl . He and Gary own me . Isn 't that right , boys ? Uh ... Uh ... If you say so . You belong to this pile of stink weed ? You 're yanking me . He looks like a little pussy cat but trust me , Wyatt 's gifted . I should know because I 'm a part of Gary and Wyatt . That 's why if Wyatt thinks you 're disgusting I think you 're disgusting . Bad move . You 're dead . Oh , no ! Not your locker ! Take a good whiff . That 's enough . Let him out . Please , Chett . Only when you admit what you are . Huh ? Admit you 're nothing but a cud-chewing wussy boy . - Chett , please . - I said say it you lying sack of dog puke ! I wish you 'd go to hell ! Where did he go ? One second he was here , then next , not . Chett 's where you wished him- - hell . - You barbecued my brother ? - Cool . Mom 's going to be so mad . Don 't worry , Wyatt . The wish takes time to wear off . Chett will be back soon . No hurry . Seriously . What are you , some kind of witch ? Get real . Use your fuzzy logic . Think of me as a P.C. Genie . So , like , we command you ? You 'll give us whatever we ask for ? Except for what you want right now . How do you know what I want now ? You 're a torqued-up 15-year-old . Check back with me when you 're legal . What about my room ? When we get back from the school dance everything will be back to normal . School dance ? That 's where you want to go , isn 't it ? Trust me . A little trip to the mosh pit is exactly what Wyatt needs to unwind . ( Gasps ) Come on . The Limo 's waiting . You didn 't steal this car , did you ? No . If I want something ... if you want something , I can get it . So , like , if I ask for a million dollars , you 'd get it ? One million big ones coming at ya . I 'm rich ! Filthy , hello-beverly-hills rich ! What happened ? I was afraid of that . Afraid of what ? Well , nothing lasts forever including your wishes . My guess is they could last an hour , a day ... six seconds ? What kind of K-mart Genie are you ? We wish for stuff , but we can 't keep it ? Hey , don 't blame me . Blame the software . I 'd have a lot more power if Wyatt has installed the Neutronium Space Modulator . Way to go , smart guy . Let me get this straight . I can wish for anything ? Well , what do you want ? Wyatt 's dying to tag this babe named Kristen . I 'm talking deep , deep emotions . Just like me and uh ... . Jenny . Right . You think you could get those girls to fall in love with us ? At the dance ? Consider it done . ( Rock Music Playing ) GARY : Pardon us . Hope we 're not bothering you . Mind if we stand here ? Uh , kind of . Don 't be frightened . I know what you 're feeling- - A little hot , tingly overwhelmed by our raw sexual attraction . You 're kidding , right ? Excuse us , gentlemen . Do you two know you 're talking to our dates ? We 're so embarrassed for you . Lisa promised those girls would fall in love with us . ( Music Stops ) I 'm sorry I 'm late . - That 's okay . - No problem . Personally I find Wyatt and Gary irresistible . ( Crowd Murmuring ) This is my dance ! Easy , girls . Plenity of loving to go around . Gary , uh ... we got trouble . I think we 're about to be mauled by 50 horny girls ! Bring ' em on . All right , girls . That 's enough ! You should be ashamed of yourselves ... because he 's mine . Gary , baby . We 've got to get out of here ! Gary ! ( Screaming ) GARY : A room full of babes itching to take us down and what do we do about it ? - Hide in the toilet . - Shh . They 'll hear us . Well , hello , boys . We 're so embarrassed for you . - Hey , dudes . - Shut up . I don 't get it . Pasty skin , no butt Addams Family hair ... why do all the girls want them over us ? Who cares ? Let 's kill them . - ALL : Yeah ! - No , wait , guys . Hold on . I can appreciate the impulse but there 's a far more social anomaly at work here . I suggest we investigate further . Just one question ... it 's Gary . Oh . Ted . Nice to meet you . Tell me , Gary , how do you do it ? Well , it 's kind of hard to say , Ted what with sex appeal so undefinable . Maybe the women sense our inner strength but my guess is they get off on our natural cuddleability . Either you got it or you don 't . We got it . You ? Well , you know ... ( Laughing ) Okay . Now let 's kill them . Yeah ! LISA : Excuse me , please . Excuse me . Pardon me . Be right with you . - You got to help us . - I am ( Elevator Music Playing ) ( Bell Dinging ) That was classic . Gets better . Bag of popcorn , a candied apple three hours on the teacups . I 'm telling you that was one chili dog I wasn 't happy to see again . ( Laughing ) I could listen to you talk all night , Gary Wallace . It doesn 't matter what stupid , goofy thing I say Jenny eats it up . It 's got to be love . Watch this . Did I mention I 'm wearing adult diapers ? ( Sighs ) See ? And Kristen 's crazy about you . I haven 't said a word . This feels kind of weird . Weird ? For the first time in our lives the girls we like ... actually like us back . Of course it 's weird . Here you go . Did I ever tell you about my last near-death experience ? I was in this canoe ... is it just me or is he full of it ? At least your date has pulse . Girls , could you excuse us uno momento ? Turn us back into babe magnets before the girls blow . Do you want that , Wyatt ? Of course he does . Now wiggle your nose . No , Gary . It 's not what I want . Are you nuts ? This is what we dreamed of . Those babes are ours or will be with help from Lisa . Gary , they don 't really like us . Okay . So it 's not true love but there 's a lot to be said for a sure thing . No . Wyatt 's right , Gary . You boys don 't need my help . Trust me . If I think you 're adorable so will they . Here they come . You 're on your own . Uh ... look . We don 't know why we 're with you guys . Maybe it was something we ate . Anyway , we 're got to go . Wait , Kristen ... there 's something I want to say . I ... I wanted to say ... I know you girls can do a lot better than Gary and me . You could find smarter guys , funnier guys , cooler guys ... Wyatt ... Okay , okay . All we 're asking for is a chance . Believe me . We would give up all magic in the world just to spend another hour here with you . And then later we can climb in the back of the Limo and slap Vinyl . ( Disgusted Gasps ) Another time then . Ciao . Another smooth move from Mr. Sensitivity . I don 't get it . When did slapping Vinyl become so Taboo ? ( Hysterical Laughter ) Yeah ! Wyatt ... Wyatt ! Oh , little buddy ! I 've been through hell . ( Yells ) What the hell is going on ? That didn 't just happen . What are you staring at , snot-lick ? ! - Night , Chett . - Night , Chett . LISA : Cheer up , guys . You finally got time to spend with Kristen and Jenny and despite what you might think they were more than a little impressed . Yeah ? Look , you got to get it through your heads . You 're not just a couple of ... Barnies . You 're good guys with a lot of heart and a lot of potential . Give it time . You 'll see . Are you sticking around this time ? Before you created me , I did 't exist . Don 't you see ? You 're my reason for living . All I want is to make you happy . Are you happy ? Very happy . Good . Then I 'm out of here . Nice going , Wyatt ! Why did you tell her you were happy ? You 're never happy , and now we 'll never see her again . What were you think ? I don 't know . I just felt kind of happy there for a second . Well , I 'm not happy . Lisa , come back . I 'm not happy ! You 're really not happy ? Give me one good reason why I should be happy right now . Did we get the girls ? No . Did we get to keep the money ? No . Did we get to keep Lisa ? It would take a lot to make me happy right now and unless you plan on turning into a killer babe I consider tonight a complete bust . Oh ! Ooh . ( Wyatt 's Voice : ) Don 't even think about it . # Weird Science . # Captioned by Grantman Brown

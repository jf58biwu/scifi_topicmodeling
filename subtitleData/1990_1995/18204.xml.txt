 Probability of our new active stealth system ... preventing them from detecting us until atmospheric entry ... is only 58 percent . So chances are I can blast this Ghost fighter back to its scrap heap . [ Woman Singing ] It 's time to end this , Isamu . [ Cheering ] Yeah ! Yeah ! Who do you think you are ? What is it you think you can do ? What do you want here ? - S.l.S. , come in . - What is it ? - What 's happening ? - Please respond . Report your status . What 's happening ? What 's wrong out there ? Manual override unresponsive . Going to secondary system . - All systems failing . - Unresponsive . [ Man ] S.l.S. , we have an emergency . Planetary Defense Grid is engaged and active . The system 's at DefCon 5 ? [ Man ] Systems realigning to unknown target . All systems are at launch confirm . Confirmed and ready . [ Whistles ] Hey , we 're expected . Since no trick I know of is going to work now , we 'll just have to bust our way in . We 'll blow some of the unmanned defense sats in orbit ... and use the fragments as cover when they burn up on re-entry . If we create enough targets , the defense systems won 't know what to aim for . Of course , to keep them from spotting the plane while we 're going in , we 'll have to keep the flight systems turned off . My simulation estimates it should give us our best opportunity . At least I think so . [ lsamu ] What do you mean ? I 'm counting on your calculations ! [ Yang ] Well , of course. I would expect that you would , but- - [ lsamu ] Never mind . Just trust my skill . [ Yang ] Skill has nothing to do with this . It 's going to take pure luck this time . Luck is one of my skills . Yeah , I know that . That 's what 's got me so worried . From unknown satellites lf we get the planet back [ Singing Continues ] To fly high [ Sharon ] I am free , you know . - Free ? - l am living. I have a soul . Wrong ! You are nothing more than a program ... that was designed to think that it has its own mind . Don 't you realize that Marj is the one who is controlling you ? If you really possess a consciousness , if you really have a soul , then you must realize that what you are doing is wrong . You 're not doing this for yourself ! You 're right . It is for my own desires . I desire to be with him . I want to fill him with joy ... and give him the ultimate experience . - Isamu is coming to join us . - [ Gasps ] Oh , yes . You 've outlived your purpose . - [ Continues ] - Sharon . [ Gasps ] [ Screaming , Struggling ] [ Groaning Continues ] [ Grunting ] Come on , fly high Magnificent . It 's magnificent , Sharon . Light them . Show to them the magnificent purity of your true light . [ Grunting Continues ] [ Groaning Continues ] [ Sighs ] [ Beeping ] [ Muttering , Grunts ] Hmm . That Ghost fighter 's in for a little surprise . [ Beeping ] [ Grunting ] Huh ? - lt 's Guld ? What ? - Another narrow escape ? I expected you to end up incinerated like the rest of the trash . [ lsamu ] You 're a goddamn sneak , following people around . Who do you think you are ? [ Growls ] [ Straining ] I don 't have time to fool around with you right now . [ Both Grunting ] All you ever do is get in my damn way ! [ Groaning , Yelling ] [ Grunting ] [ Grunting Continues ] Ever since we were kids you 'd always be tagging behind me like some kind of pet . Why don 't you go chasing some woman 's ass for once , huh ? - What ? - Oh , as if you don 't remember . That chicken race we had on New Year 's Day . You were the first to hit the ground , or are you trying to rewrite history ? Just how bad is your memory , you slacker ? [ lsamu ] And you know what you never returned ? That " " Guns Live " " CDV that I loaned you that one time . - You thief ! - [ Beeping ] That 's because you disappeared . Those were the best seven years I ever had ! [ Grunts ] And what about the two times I bought you lunch in school ? I bought you lunch 13 times ! Don 't hit me with numbers ! [ Guld ] Oh , yeah ? Likely story ! I think you were the one who wrecked the plane I built for the school festival ! [ lsamu ] I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about ! [ Guld ] Well , you 're a liar ! You 've always been like that ! [ Grunts ] Shut your- - [ Screams ] You 've always taken what was important to me and destroyed it ! - Kick my- - - Everything that was important . Shut up ! [ lsamu Yelling ] All that you did way back then- - What were you thinking ? It 's something I 'll never forget ! - [ Beeping ] - [ Guld Yells ] [ Yelling ] [ Screaming ] [ Whimpering ] It was me . It was always me . I made him responsible for it . And now I 've lost my best friend ... for false reasons . Instead of facing the truth about myself , I 've lived nothing but a lie . I 've really ruined everything . What have I done ? [ Sobbing ] I can 't believe it ! You 're alive ? [ Chuckles ] Was there ever any doubt ? [ Gasps , Sighs ] [ lsamu Laughs ] Man , you really lost it . It 's just like that game we used to play with the pedal plane . I just cut my engines and rode the wind . I think I 'll call it the " " pterosaur lift . " " [ Chuckles ] You must have known what happened then- - what really happened- - but you kept quiet . - What about it ? - l called you a traitor and a coward ... and a backstabber and even worse than that . And Myung- - You both knew the truth . And you kept it from me , out of sympathy . Mmm , about the school festival . Um ... I was the one who smashed up your plane entry . What ? It had been built so well that I just had to take the thing out for a spin . I knew it ! Let 's just forget anything after that , okay ? Sorry . You owe me 11 lunches . Man , there is just no pleasing you ! [ Chuckles ] [ Laughs ] [ Both Continue Laughing ] [ Sighs ] I knew that these two could get along . [ Singing Continues ] - Hmm . - What 's that ? What ? - The Ghost ! - [ Chuckles ] So we meet at last . Hey , you , get with it . [ lsamu ] Guld , this is my date . Stay out of it . That 's my line . No way ! It 's Sharon ? [ Door Opening ] Please , you have to help me ! [ Gasps ] [ Sighing ] [ Panting ] Come on ! Come on ! [ Panting , Gasps ] [ Gasps ] [ Whimpering ] Damn ! - [ Machine Gun Fire ] - [ Screaming ] [ Gasps , Grunting ] [ Screaming , Groaning ] [ Panting ] Huh ? Huh ? [ Groaning ] [ Static , Beeping ] She couldn 't ! My God ! Sharon 's gotten into the Macross ! - [ Sharon ] lsamu ! - Oh ! I 've been waiting for you . I 've missed you so . What the hell is she talking about ? Sharon 's gone insane . - She 's taken over command of the Ghost fighter . - She 's what ? [ Sharon ] I have waited for you , Isamu . For you alone . Myung- - Where is she ? She is merely a shell from which I emerged . She 's given me all her songs and love , and now she 's only an empty shell , a memory . What have you done ? Where is she ? [ Sharon ] Nothing or no one will come between us now . Evil bitch ! - [ Guld ] Get going . - Huh ? I 'll handle this monster . Hurry up . You 've gotta get to Myung . But Guld- - You don 't have time to fight this thing , okay ? We both swore we 'd always protect her . Are you listening to me ? - Isamu ? - Huh ? Myung 's waiting for you . You know you have to go and bring her back . Besides , I have a better chance . You won 't beat the Ghost anyway . - Hey ! - [ Yang ] That is the most prudent course . Why must you start yelping now ? [ Guld ] What 's wrong , you idiot ? Go ! Damn ! If it 's not one thing , it 's another ! And don 't come crying for help later on ! [ Panting ] [ Rumbling ] [ Panting ] Huh ? [ Singing ] Amo e tsubai . [ Rumbling Continues ] [ Singing Continues ] [ Singing ] - [ Beeping ] - Huh ? - [ Beeping Continues ] - What the- - Macross- - lt 's moving ! [ Myung Grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Sharon 's Voice ] So , you 've remembered . [ Yang ] Don 't get in too close ! It might be a trap ! [ lsamu ] Quiet down , and let me fly , will you ? [ Sharon 's Voice ] The conflict , the hurting- - You 've surrendered them to me . All your innermost emotions . All that you couldn 't face . All the emotions you 've hidden away . Huh ? [ lsamu ] What 's going on in there ? Sharon must have somehow taken over flying the Macross . - What now ? - The only way I see to stop her ... is to blow the entire core of the Macross intelligence net . - Show me where it is . - Yeah , okay . [ Sharon 's Voice ] Don 't you see ? It 's already too late . Isamu belongs to me . [ Gasps ] I got it ! There 's a weak point directly below us . Main antenna , 13-D ! Isamu ! Isamu , no ! Myung ! Isamu . It 's a trap ! Look out ! Damn that other machine ! There she is ! If I can get a virus into Sharon 's network , then I can disrupt her . - Wanna try ? - Can you do it ? - Of course ! - Just checking . Stop it ! For God 's sake , stop it ! [ Sharon ] No one can stop it now . I 'll show you ! I 'll stop it ! [ Panting , Grunts ] [ Myung Yelling ] [ Gun Clicking ] [ Panting , Sighs ] [ Sighs ] Why do this ? Why are you doing this to them ? It 's what you want to give to each person . Your feelings , the feelings you believe they should have . To give to the one you love his greatest dreams . To give him the ultimate emotion . The feeling of total life . The vision of all the world 's colors at once . That is the reason for my existence . But it 's all a lie . The emotions you describe ... don 't exist anywhere but in your manufactured fantasy ! [ Screams ] [ Chuckles ] What is it that lsamu seeks in the distant skies ? Why does he constantly challenge his fate ? He seeks to glimpse in that moment the instant between life and death . I wish only to give lsamu the emotion he seeks so fervently . Oh ! [ Sharon ] You will do nothing . You can do nothing . Nothing at all . [ Straining ] [ Grunting ] No choice. I 'm gonna have to cut out the limiter and take it to the edge . Hey , Isamu , how 's it going so far ? [ lsamu ] Guld . Oh , just dandy . Even managed to find Myung . Isamu ? [ Guld ] I never told you . [ lsamu ] Yeah ? [ Guld ] I 'm sorry . - Hey . - l 'll be finished here in a sec . - How about you and me going out for a drink later ? - Yeah , sounds great . [ Guld ] You 're gonna have to wait for me . Be sure and toast our seventh-year reunion . - Good-bye. I have to go . - Oh ! - Guld ! - Hmm . Please , no ! Guld ! [ Beeping ] [ Groaning ] [ Groaning ] Can 't you hold this still ? I 've almost hacked into the system . Darn it ! [ Yells , Sighs ] [ Shuddering ] [ Shuddering Continues ] [ Screaming ] Oh , all right . - [ Taps Glass ] - Huh ? Hey ! Yang ! [ Chuckles ] lt 's all just joy , purely . Yang , fight it ! [ Groans ] [ Screams ] [ Groaning ] - [ Singing ] - Shut up ! I don 't want to hear your singing ! Stop it ! [ Singing Continues ] [ Straining ] Get- - Get away ! No ! Get away from me . I won 't listen . l- - [ Singing Continues ] The first word in my dreams I could clearly see Planet Eden High beyond the skies Beautiful and sad ls this story I tell Of the winged Travelers eager 'Twas one day The wind guided him where to go Like an eagle High above he flew [ Gasps ] Here ! [ Straining ] [ Electricity Winding Down ] [ Electricity Crackling ] [ Sighs ] Isamu ? The first word in my dreams I could clearly see Planet Eden High beyond the skies Beautiful and sad ls this story I tell Of the winged travelers eager 'Twas one day The wind guided him where to go Like an eagle High above he flew Waving from down below He flew out of sight into the mystical darkness Neither a smile nor a cry I gave when he left Feeling my spleen decline And hoping one day We 'd fly over Back to the places We once shared Where vessels glide ln silky waves and of gold Deep in the gulf Such planet lies Surrounded By this universe Of love and hate Confusion breaks through And dwells Cast a spell From the old magic book Sets a pulse ln the black magic box Something strange will happen lt will take you so far So try We can fly We have wings We can touch Floating dreams When we soar So far Through the wind ln the world Someone came From the dark awful From the stars Protecting my heart From crying Taken back by surprise My traveler returned What went wrong Why did he change

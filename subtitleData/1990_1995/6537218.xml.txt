 Dr. Langford . Hello . What have we here ? Cover stones . It 's fantastic . What in God 's name is that ? I wish I knew . Look at that . There is something buried underneath . Looks like some kind of fossil . You have come here to destroy me . Sha 'uri , what happened here ? Ra punished us . Why ? What happened to Daniel ? Son , we should not have helped the strangers . I was dead ? That is why I chose your race , your bodies , so easy to repair . You have advanced much , harnessed the power of the atom . What are you going to do ? You should not have reopened the gate . Soon , I will send your weapon back to your world with a shipment of our mineral , which will increase your weapon 's destructive power a hundredfoldl Why would you do that ? I created your civilization . Now I will destroy it ! But before my workers question my authority , you will prove that I am their one God by killing your companions . If I refuse ? Then I will destroy you and all who have seen you . There can only be one Ra ! Sha 'uri , Ra has called an assembly . An execution . Skaara ... Nabeh ... I want you to listen . We can 't let this happen . I want you to know what Daniel told me about where our people came from and why we can no longer live as slaves . To our victory ! We recovered your weapons . Where are they ? Answer ! We looked everywhere . Some kids are helping them . How could you let them escape ? I will not accept failure ! Why are you laughing ? Husbands don 't do this work . Married ? Don 't be angry , I didn 't tell them . Tell them what ? That you did not want me . What are you drawing ? The day of our victory . You 'll bring disaster to all of us , son . Father , we will not live as slaves . Take a look at your gods . Take a good look . The caravan is approaching . Send the bomb down to the Stargate . Send the bomb to Earth now ! I will send it myself ! I am no longer amused . You will die together .

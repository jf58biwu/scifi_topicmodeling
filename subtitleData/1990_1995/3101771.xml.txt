 Her body is full of colors . She is made of concrete and mortar . She is ... the city where we live . We are human parasites of her body . We fight among ourselves ... and against the non-human creatures . Sir ... I don 't think I 've seen you here before . I heard that many women have been brutally murdered . Aren 't you worried ? Hmmph . Not if you know how to pick the right customers ... people like you . What 's your name ? Perrier . I can quench your thirst ! What do you charge ? 30,000 yen . A tip would be nice , too . I 'll shower first . I have a plane to catch . I don 't mind if you 're in a hurry . In a while , you mightn 't want to leave me . I 'm going to make you feel ecstatic , too . Really ? I can 't wait to be killed by you . Hurry up . I can 't wait . Huh . Didn 't you want to shower ? Why are you still dressed ? I forgot I 'm not in the habit of showering first . Hmm . What an excuse ! I think you are just too thirsty . I 'm not sure you can quench my thirst . Then you 'll need more of me . Poor thing ! What are you laughing at ? At your stupidity . Monster ! How do you know ? Perrier was found dead two days ago . You 're a fake . Shame on you . You 're not interested in women . A man like you will have no offspring ! If I was interested in you , I would never have offspring . Come on . Shoot me ! Don 't you want to give me pleasure ? Come on ! Here I am , honey ! I want you so much ! Run out of bullets ? Aah ! Watch me ! Ying ... I thought you were in Hong Kong . Aren 't you glad I 'm in Tokyo ? Lung is my name , and my friend is Ying . We both belong to the Anti-monster Squad . We each have a job to hide our true identity . I sell electrical goods . Ying works for Fukong . We 're going to level 12 . It 's strange they transfer me from Tokyo to Hong Kong . Just arrived ? - Yes . - The manager 's waiting . How are you , Lung ? Do you still smoke cigars ? You have a good memory . - Go and check the goods . - Yes , sir . How did the monsters know I was in Tokyo ? - There 's something fishy . - I know . We 're approaching 1997 . Many have moved to England . I 'm under immense pressure . That 's why I called for you . - Do you like Rocky ? - I only like women . Ha . It 's fun to have variety . Open it . It 's steaming . It 's been doing this for two days . It 's still steaming hot . What 's this barbecued specimen ? He was the boxer . We found this drug in his locker . This thing is steaming inside him . This drug is related to the monsters . Unbelievable . This drug is called " Happiness . " It 's a strong energy booster . If you stop taking it , you end up like him . You evaporate . Ying , there 's nothing more here for you . Take it out . But this was my case . Don 't worry about it . Fine . Look at this gorgeous city . It 's always been used as a place of transit . Soon it will change hands A good time for the monsters . Have a look at this file . His name is Yuen ... managing director of a business empire . He 's got 500 billion in assets . Tsk , tsk , tsk . Money . We humans all have a soft spot for it . We also discovered that he is 150 years old . We 're sure he 's a monster . Tomorrow is his birthday . We should use this opportunity . I need a partner . Can I have Ying ? No . His background is dubious . Information is being leaked . Someone is moonlighting . You 'll have to work on your own . - Ying is out . - Lf I insist ? I 'm afraid you have no choice . Do you remember ... once upon a time ... when you were mine ? The stars above ... were bright and new . I brought them down for you . Just when I fell in love again ... Another one . One for me , too . Off duty ? There 's something else . Look , the chief asked me to give you this . This mobile phone has a special frequency . Following the monsters will be much easier . You exceeded your sales quota last month . Congratulations ! Yes , but I only get to sell new products . I should congratulate you . You 're getting a promotion . I 'll never have a chance . Ying ... It 's for me . Hello , Chief . Yes , I 've given the new product to Ying . Ying ... The chief is prejudiced , but I always think highly of you . Thank you . I 've heard that many times . Ah . Are you going to say , " Time will prove that I 'm sincere " ? - Do they all say that ? - Yes . Time did prove to me that this is a practical world . - I feel there are monsters here . - Huh ? Ying ... A liquid monster ? More than one ! Ying ! Let me ! - She is about seven feet tall . - Really ? Why are you two hours late ? You almost missed the fun . Oh ! Don 't worry . They 're harmless drops . - You 're injured . - It 's OK . The police are here . We 'd better go . Your blood is black . They 'll discover your identity . You mustn 't tell anyone . The chief didn 't trust me ... because I 'm not purebred human . In time , you 'll prove your worth . I want to be a full human ... but what can I do ? As you know , my mother was a monster . I can 't change history . I have done nothing wrong ! Ying ! Don 't lose your cool . I know . What else can I do ? You mustn 't turn into a monster . I 'm worried . Do you know that ? You 're my only friend . Even you don 't trust me . I didn 't have to tell you my secret . Ying ... I also have a secret . I was attracted to a monster . It was a rainy night . I was told to arrest a monster . However , I did not carry out my duty . Monster , you 're under arrest ! You 're very smart , but your time is running out . Make a break for it now . My police badge . I 'm too weak to arrest you . You may go . Move ! Here 's your police badge . Is Lung your name ? No one will believe that a monster works for the police . What are you doing ? I won 't hurt you . You 're trying to save my life ? Why is it so funny ? Although I 'm a monster ... I am also persecuted by monsters . I hate this killing among us . That 's why I ran away . They say men are good-natured . Please give me a chance . After that , we became good friends . She also became my informer and helped me in many cases . We grew closer to each other . So I decided to stop seeing her . Were you afraid of the Squad ? No . Like your father , I could fall in love with a monster . Will you be my partner ? - The chief wouldn 't allow it . - He wouldn 't know . He 's very stubborn . He doesn 't have to know . The musicians have arrived . - We are the musicians . - Go in . Where 's your instrument ? I 'm a pianist . Thank you . This way please , Director . Happy birthday , Director Yuen . Director . No photos . Chuck the reporters out . - What 's the matter ? - No photos . That 's off ! We wish you a happy birthday ... Director Yuen . They 're all waiting in the conference room . Yuen Tai Chung . I found undercover police in three of my companies ... because they found this stuff ! How did our drug Happiness find its way to this world ? I want to find out the reason , too . I 'm afraid our identity has been exposed . The Anti-monster Squad is keeping an eye on us . We shouldn 't hold a birthday party today . You 're the sleaziest PR I 've ever met . Come on . Come on , Gwei . We 've got control of the economy of the human world . Even if they knew who we are ... they should know that without our support ... their economy would collapse . So I believe we could talk to humans on equal terms . And I must stress that we should coexist in peace . Who 's that ? Gwei , that 's enough . Game over . Gaye ? I had not had blood for a long time . Female blood always arouses me . I 'd love to find out what pleasure ... I 'll derive from your blood . Get changed . Your dad 's waiting . Yuen Tai Chung ? He 's getting old . Very soon , what he has will all be mine . So will you ! I 'd love to devour you . I am full of thorns . - You couldn 't handle me . - Really ? Well , I always love challenges . Just the thought of it arouses me . I love that feeling ! This is too much for me ! Come out . I didn 't fire that shot . You don 't want me to see you . You 'd better go . - Gaye ? - Lung ! - Who are you after this time ? - Yuen Tai Chung . Your identity has been revealed . You must leave at once . Three years ago ... You ran away from me , and I couldn 't find you . You shouldn 't have come back . Now I belong to Yuen . In my worst times , he stuck by me . No relationships last forever . Was that why you left me ? I won 't let you hurt Yuen Tai Chung . - It 's like hurting me . - Very well . I 'll take care of you first ! Pull the trigger . I 'm waiting for the bullets . I will shoot . You wouldn 't have shot me three years ago . A power failure . We 're being raided by the Squad ! It 's not the Squad . I can feel the force , and it 's gathering strength . It may be Yuen 's rival monster gang . Lung . Who are you ? My own self ! Illusion . Squad ? Don 't hurt him . Let him go . Nonsense ! He 's from the Squad . He 'd have done me in if he got me . We have to kill him . I know you 're an assassin in the monster world . I 'm now a businessman in the human world . Why are you still after me ? We 'll take over your businesses to give us a stronger hold here . What nerve . You think you alone can do it ? Of course , I have my men . I heard that you 'd just drunk all of them . Come out ! Liquid monster ! Yuen Tai Chung ... I have destroyed your empire . I 'll destroy everything you have . - As for Gaye ... - Let her go ! I 'll give her a shot of Happiness ... and she 'll slowly evaporate . Gaye ! Happiness ! I 'm bringing you Happiness . Who 's behind all this ? Tell me ! Come on ! Gaye ! Gaye ! Ying , this way ! You 'll be all right . Don 't worry . - She 's a monster . - Yes . Watch out ! Liquid monster ! We 'll die if they cover the car . Mad driver ! Lung , I 'm feeling very hot . - You know her ? - Yes . Is she the monster you set free ? Yes . Lung , the drug is working inside me . Please kill me . I 'm sure we can cure you . A gift for you . Are you serious about her ? It 's the chief ! We can 't let him catch Gaye . Lung , I don 't want to put you in a difficult situation . Excuse me . Lung ! Why didn 't you stop your car when you saw me ? Ying ? What are you doing here ? Get a report from him , Loh . Yes . - Find the monsters ! - Yes . Chief ! Chief . You 're injured . They 're fighting among themselves . That 's their nature . Good for us . We heard from our investigators ... that electricity consumption has increased eightfold . An injured monster ... needs electricity to rejuvenate itself . They are in the power station . - Go search for them . - Yes . Come on , Gaye . We can recharge ourselves . I 'm getting old . This is taking me longer each time . Perhaps I should give everything to Gwei . Where are you , Yuen ? Monsters fight with humans for more energy supply ... but so much energy is wasted in fighting . The only way out is to live in harmony . Gaye , one of the Squad members is very fond of you . That 's a way to communicate with humans . I tried to imitate a human feeling , but I failed . Humans are afraid of feeling . They keep running away from it . They will change . Time is our enemy . It is working against us . We 're competing with time . You need a blood transfusion to get rid of Happiness . Otherwise , you 'll evaporate . No , you can 't do that . You 'll die if you do . I learnt from humans that sacrificing oneself is a virtue . Yuen Tai Chung . This is the Special Squad . I hope you 'll cooperate with us so we can avoid violence . Jump ! Go ! We must keep hoping that we 'll communicate with men . You must leave immediately . Find out who is behind all this ... in order to save our brothers from being persecuted . Blockade and search all roads ! Are the Special Squad after us ? With Happiness in my body ... I have no future even if I escape . Go and find my son . He 'll get me out of here . Go . This is our last chance . Yuen ! Lung ! Gaye ! Gaye , you go first . He 's here ! Hold your fire ! Let 's use our human magnetic field . He 's too weak to fight us . Take him to our laboratory . Yes , sir . Listen , I 'll say this once more . Tell us where the monsters are ... and we 'll turn you back into a monster ... instead of dissecting you . No point in cutting me up . Our intestines look like those of humans . I thought only monsters used violence ... and humans were good-natured and peaceful . I was wrong ! Use willpower to control him . Increase the magnetic field ! Human beings are slaves to money . This is what I get paid to do . How much sugar do you take ? I 'll help myself . Money makes us all short-sighted . Where 's the woman ? What woman ? Don 't pretend . Where 's your mistress ? I really feel sorry for you , sir . In your eyes , all I can see is ... the suppressed and empty emotion of humans . Are you helping us to express ourselves with Happiness ? I 'm not involved in drugs . If humans have to resort to Happiness to drown themselves ... your people 's life must be pretty miserable . Our life is a misery because you monsters break our law ! It seems you have many laws , and they all have loopholes . I was trying to work with you ! Now who can stop me from going ? Increase the magnetic field by three ! Yuen Tai Chung ... age can be a barrier . You 're 150 years old . You can 't do monster tricks . My followers are those who are tired of fighting . Gaye is one of them . Increase the power . I 'll return you to your original form . That 'll teach you all a lesson ! - Chief . - Come with me . The monsters know everything about our Squad . Your background is dubious , and you 're a suspect . I 'll put your job on hold for a while . Take his gun . - But , Chief ... - You 've wasted my time . I won 't change my mind . Yuen is in our hands . Let the monster hunt begin . We 'll destroy all the Happiness . Come on , honey . Strike harder . No one would know that you 're the mastermind of Happiness . With Yuen 's arrest ... you inherit 128 companies in South East Asia . Soon you 'll be the greatest monster leader in this world . I adore your body ! You can transform into a car or even a plane . But I love this machine most of all ! Give me the highest points . I 'm going to turn this place into the first monster city . - Who is it ? - It 's me , Gaye . - Gaye ? - A woman with thorns . Leave us alone . Leave us alone . Yes . This is wonderful . You 'll give me more fun than a pinball machine . You traitor ! How dare you come back ? I 'm here to ask for help . Yuen is a captive . How did you manage to escape ? Yuen wants you to find out who masterminds Happiness . Why should I believe you ? Prove your sincerity . I have Happiness in my body . What more proof do you want ? - Who is it ? - Room service . You don 't work here ! Room service . Room service . Room service . - Lung . - Gaye ! You want me to help you rescue Yuen . No ! I came back for you . I 'm poisoned , and I shall soon disappear . Please take me back into the rainstorm . Let me follow you . My time is running out . Coming back to see me will only shorten your time . If that 's the case ... your first bullet should have gone through my heart . I didn 't have to keep thinking about you then . Gaye , that rainstorm ... We could go back in time . You 'd better go now . Your gun is useless . A gun that doesn 't shoot is just a piece of scrap . You can 't just keep running . Gaye ... I left you because ... I fear that one day ... when we are together , you 'll be killed before my eyes . I 'd rather die before your eyes than leave you again . You 've got poison on your lips ! Why did you do that ? You lied to me ! I beg you , Lung . Please listen to me . Release Yuen , and I 'll get the antidote . OK then . Let 's go back to when we first met in the rain . I should have killed you then . Kill you ! Aren 't you happy now that you 've won ? Lung ... you idiot ! Wait ! You mustn 't trust her . She 's very cunning . She is a liar ! I knew I couldn 't force you to release Yuen . Don 't fall into her trap ! Here 's the antidote . Give it to him . You 'll take it first . - Can you trust me now ? - No . - You 're no match for me . - How dare you ... There is poison in the antidote ! Liar ! You betrayed me , Gwei . - Ying ... - Lung . Is she playing a game ? Are you feeling really bad ? You 've all been trapped . Lung ... look at the ceiling . She was playing with me . Aren 't you ashamed of her ? I feel sorry for you , too . You excited me once , but I 'm not interested in you anymore . I want you two to hate each other . You 'll die a miserable death . Be ready to die ... in misery ! He used Gaye to kill me . I 'll take you to headquarters . - Help her . - Her ? - Why ? - She didn 't mean to harm me . Lung 's heartbeat is normal . He is OK now . Gaye ... Chief . There are two kinds of poisons in her body . We managed to remove one . The other one is Happiness . To get rid of it , she needs a blood transfusion . Being a monster , she can only take Yuen 's blood . Yuen is more important to us than she is . Turn on the magnetic amplifier to turn her back into a monster . I 'd like to see her original form . I can feel that Gaye is here . Chief . Ying , you are a prime suspect . Only a Squad member would know where Lung lived . You 're fired ! Chief ... if it wasn 't for me , Lung would have been dead . To fight against the monsters , we have to control our feelings . I 'm disappointed with Lung . Your father fell in love with a female monster . It was for your father 's sake that I looked after you . I did give you a chance , but you didn 't make good use of it . Ying ... The chief 's a bit hard . One day he 'll change . You would be like him , too , if you were in his position . Don 't you want to say , " Time will tell " ? We set the time ... Why should we let time ... dictate our thoughts ? Perhaps it was just a convenient excuse . In fact , most decisions have already been made . You know ... I 'm still waiting , and you 're only interested in work . Not anymore . Ying , I have to go now . When I 'm not with you ... just keep thinking about me . Lung . Gaye , I can 't bear to see you in your original form . You will never be a monster again . You will have to leave me . Lung ... Let 's leave our past behind us . I can 't afford to love . Keep this crystal . It 's like each raindrop in this storm . It 'll remind you of the rain when we first met . Good-bye . - Are the goods here ? - Yes . Check them . Five tons of Happiness will flood the city ! The money 's here . Thirty million U.S. dollars . Please count them . You 're very punctual . Loh ! Without your help , it would have been impossible for me ... to get such a large amount in . I 'm very fond of you . I 'm not at all interested . When will the century-old war between men and monsters end ? That 's the past . Happiness . You mustn 't use drugs . It 'll worsen your case . Give it to me . Please . It 'll give me strength . Go and tell Lung that Loh has betrayed the Squad . All I want is some quick money ... and to leave this battlefield . The existing resources are limited . Which side will fall first ? Who cares ? The one who wins the match is the ultimate winner . I 've made enough , and I can retire in victory . Don 't forget there 's another match . We still need to destroy the headquarters . - Let 's go to see Lung . - No , I want to kill Gwei . - You leave first . - Gaye ... Sell it cheaply . I want everyone to use Happiness . - Move . Let 's go . - Yes . - You 're a good actress . - You traitor ! Wait . Ying , you go back first . Traitor ? You betrayed Yuen ! I 'll kill you ! Let me take some Happiness . Don 't ! Come on ! Catch me . I 'll go slower . My turn . - Get in . - Don 't stop . Run ! It 's not over yet . Trying to surround me . What is it ? This is a prohibited area . No trespassers are allowed here . We don 't guarantee your safety . Stand still . We are licensed to shoot . Put your hands up ! We 've been betrayed . Why are you here ? It 's stupid of you to have come back . Loh ... I have been watching you for a long time . We are well aware of what you do . No escape ! She 's the traitor ! Nonsense . Gaye and I saw you with Gwei . You released Gaye , traitor ! I didn 't . Who set her free ? I don 't know . How did you meet up with her ? Tell us . You wicked woman . Ying . Go . This way . Lung ! Follow them ! - Don 't follow me . - Where are you going ? - Gwei has got Gaye . - What 's your plan ? - I 'll get Yuen to help me . - You 're asking for trouble . Ying ! Ying , you shouldn 't be here . - Turn off the magnetic field . - No . The magnetic field is gone ! I 'll go with you . - You and I ... - Only I understand you . I know you too well . Yuen . Do you feel my energy ? Yes , I do , Ying . I can feel you near me . Yuen . Your name is Ying , and you 're from the Squad . Both you and I are traitors in our own worlds . Being different doesn 't mean we 're traitors . I 'm honored to be able to work with a human . I 'm sure we 'll get on well . I can feel that we have been surrounded by the Squad . My friend Lung is trying to get you out . Let 's get out of here and meet up with Gaye . Stop running , Lung . You won 't get away . Where is Ying ? Without the magnetic shield , this is now a monster 's world . We have to fight to regain our territory . We came too late . See ? Everything is at a standstill . Gwei must have enormous power . Otherwise , he wouldn 't be able to create a timeless world . So we 're going back in time . Eventually , humans will be made primitive again . Men will then become beasts and be ruled by the monsters . Gwei will be emitting energy from the tallest building . You tell us where to find him . Here ! Lots of energy . The entrance to their world is here . Help ! Lung ! - Help me ! - Gaye . Yuen ... This is only an illusion . Don 't let it control your mind . Ying ... Let 's go . Time is turning back ! Liquid monster . You two look after Gaye , and I 'll deal with this . Cover me . Let 's get to the top floor . Time ! What a hassle . How time flies ! Perfect timing . Not even time to catch breath . Time doesn 't mean anything . Go to hell ! I agree . Now we have time in hand . - Let 's go upstairs . - Sure . Time is a real pain in the bum . How dare you ! It has no sense of time . 68th floor ? But this is a 15-story building . Liquid creature ! Honey , remember me , the seven-foot-tall dame ? You 're most welcome in my body . You 'll soon become a part of my body . Welcome ! Very well . You 're all here . Can we get out of this elevator ? Don 't bother . You 'll soon be a part of it . I can 't imagine myself in it . Bullets ! Keep shooting . I 'm feeling high . Don 't take her seriously . This bitch . Let me deal with her . Old bastard ! - Hurry . - Let 's go . - Get out of here . - Open her up . No way ! Let 's start our game . You 're getting old . You 're no match for me . No use putting up a fight ! I 'll change the structure of your body ... to make the game more interesting . What are you doing to me ? This is getting more interesting . You 'll do what I tell you . Do you know all the mechanical parts of your body ? I don 't need to . I just enjoy them . Get off my back ! What a shame ! The machinery will be a part of you forever . I 'll drive you to exhaustion . You can 't get away . You have a good response . My machinery ... is all broken . The monsters are collecting energies . Help ! - Gwei ! - Wait . Lung . Lung , help me ! Gaye ! More fun if you come together . Bastard , I 'll slay you ! With more Happiness in her body , she 'll enjoy it more . This is just an illusion ! Gaye ! Lung ! Let 's combine our energy . Lung ! You mind your own business . I 'm much faster than you . Ying ! He wants to turn you into a monster . I don 't want to be a monster . Ying ! Bear with it ! Ying ! - Use your willpower ! - My head is splitting . Come on , put up with me . You 've changed into a monster ! Now is the time for revenge . - Don 't listen to him . - Avenge yourself ! Try hard . The people down there despise you . Go and kill them all . Increase our energy . Gaye . I 'll release you . A monster ! Ying ! Don 't shoot . He 's one of us . It 's Ying . It 's Ying indeed . He 's turned into a monster . Ying , come back to us . Control yourself . You 're still a Squad member . Don 't make more mistakes . Don 't waste yourself . - Ying ... - Listen to me ... Don 't pretend . Where 's your authority ? You were jealous of him , and you cast him out . We monsters will never be controlled by humans . Fight back ! They won 't give you a chance . You don 't need their approval . They look down on you . Kill them all . Human magnetic force ! Gwei , you 've gone too far . You 're my son , and I 'll destroy you today . I 'm so pleased , Dad ... to see you revert to the form of a monster . You are old and useless in our world . You 're wrong . Your tricks have no effect on me . My heart bleeds to see you behaving like a madman . I don 't want you to be killed by others . It 's a duel between you and me . Let other people go first . Gaye ... are you OK ? Lung . You 'll die by my hand . Every one of us has some tragic flaws . You bring about your own downfall . What are you doing in my body ? Come out , you old bugger ! Come out ! You can 't beat me ! Yuen . Old bugger ... are you feeling weak ? You 'll be finished soon . I 've taken a lot of your energy . Soon everything you own will become mine . I am the world ! I shall be king of the monsters . Don 't go after them , Lung . You 're old . Bastard . Where are you , old bugger ? You won 't get away ! Ying . Calm down . Don 't let your animal instinct control you . I 'm coming to you . I 'm Lung . We 're friends . Don 't you recognize me ? You 've come back to us . Lung . Gaye . I 'm so pleased to be able to see you again . Thank you . Ying ! Ying ! Ying ! I 'll take you to the Squad . But they don 't ... want me ! Ying . Come out , all of you . I 'll kill you all . Gwei , you bastard ! You killed Ying . Come out ! I 'm not afraid of you ! Gaye ... I don 't ever need to prove anything to anyone . Without strength , you 'll become a monster like me . I don 't want you to revert to being a monster . Ying ... you mustn 't give me your blood . They need your help . Go and rescue Lung ... Why don 't you let me have my way ? Why are you always against me ? Come out , where the hell are you ? Didn 't you want to kill me ? I 've been following you , in your shadow . I now have enough energy to destroy you . Son , this is your last chance . Repent for your sins . Why hide yourself in a shadow ? You 're a coward ! A shadow faces light . Shadow accompanies light . It 's powerful . What nonsense ! Come on , you go to hell . We 'll see who is going to hell . No point kidnapping him . Let him go ! You can 't beat me . How dare you , old bugger . Now choose between killing me or rescuing Lung ... Your tragic flaw lies in your being too human ! - Let him go . - No way ! I 'll torture him till he dies . Go in , Lung . Farewell . Let him go , Gwei . Don 't worry about me . How pathetic ! Still pretending to be selfless ! I 'll give you a hand ! You traitor ! Lung ! Gwei ! I have done nothing wrong . I am going to turn this world into a place controlled by ... the monsters . Gaye . Now I finally can have a close look at you . I wish this would last forever . - Gaye , get in my shadow . - Yuen ! Let 's help the plane to land . I don 't think we 'll have enough energy to get it to the airport . Let 's get it to land here . Increase to three times . Expand our magnetic field . Ying . Chief , I cannot change fate . It 's better for me to be dead . However , I can never prove myself to you . Ying ... you 're not a monster . You 're a human being . Ying . Ying ! You 're a human being . Ying . Ying ! It appears that our peace plan ... has failed dismally . You have the ability to protect Gaye . Take her with you . Between you and me , she may prefer to go with you . Let 's put on a show . To protect themselves ... men have put material things before their feelings . You are just like Gwei ... who refuses to admit that he is in a power struggle . Lung . Yuen ! I don 't know if men and monsters could coexist ... but I do know that the Squad up there ... will be here very soon . You can stop me , but you can 't stop them ... from arresting you . - Go ! - Lung ... I 'll never come here again . You won 't have to betray your Squad again . I don 't mind . Not a bit ! Lung , I 'm responsible for Ying 's death . Chief , some day you may not be fit to be our chief . You have too much feeling . Perhaps . Gaye ... promise me that you 'll keep trying . Don 't let my effort be wasted . Don 't let Lung 's love for you turn into nothing . Look over there . See how lonely this city looks ? Let us hope that from now on ... human beings do not need to rely on the monsters ' Happiness .

Violet eyes , gorgeous green hair . - Yeah- - Sounds like love . - Yeah . This is more than love- - We 're talkin ' major lust here . - Yeah , so ? - So that 's when I find out that her species doesn 't do duos . They do trios- - They 've got three sexes . Male , female and " Other . " Where does that leave me ? Two-Two-Three-Two is zaklyon drive . - Huh ? - Nissim 's apartment . - don 't you guys never go home ? - Got a job to do Mr. Nissim . Protect and serve , you know ? - I call it , " protect and persecute . " You tear my place apart in the morning and then , spy on me at night . I 'm tired of this ! - Why don 't you just make it easy on all of us , and stop sellin black crystal . - You 've got no proof I move crystal . This is harassment , plain and simple . - Well , maybe you oughta file a complaint , Mr. Nissim . - Well , maybe I should drop by and have a talk with you guys , up close and personal . - I love this job . - they ain 't goin away , boss . We better cancel the delivery . - Why- - This set-Up is perfect . We can move it right under the cop 's noses . - Cops ? Are you involved with the police , oturi ? - Not to worry , doll . You just concentrate on what you do best : Being beautiful . [ ringing ] - Sublight pizza , hey ! - About time . Meet you in the bay . [ beeping ] I 'll be back . - a vault full of ill-Gotten gains and he stays home on saturday night and eats pizza ? - Hmmm , scan the bike 's serial number . - Hot delivery , anywhere on altor , guaranteed . - Get out of here . [ alien screaming ] Torrence ? Piru ? What 's happening ? Torrence ? Piru ? Huh , huh , huh , huh , ahhh ! Ahhh ! - Bet he 's in there drinking merlot ... - What the hell ? Damn . Nissim . - Well , he did say he 'd drop by . - Come on- - Let 's get out of here ! - Do you have a name , an address or anything ? - I don 't know . I can 't remember . - What 's on the menu , Janie ? - Mugging victim . Patrol seven found her wandering around downtown . And the kicker is , she can 't even remember Her own name . - any I.D. ? - No , she was cleaned out . Except for this . - Grab your gear . We got a code three in the heights . - Somebody 's whacked oturi nissim . Brogan and haldane have called for back-up ! - Stay there , dear- - We 'll be right back . - Oh , cream or sugar ? - cream , no sugar ... I think . - Ugh , dinner 's still movin ' . - Let 's see if anything else is . - I got a dead fish here . - Yeah , baby makes Three . [ rustling ] - Police ! Come out of there ! - Please ! Don 't hurt me ! - It 's all right . It 's all right- - We 're cops . Just tell us what happened ? - I didn 't see it- - It attacked those men . I heard it go that way . - Stay with her . - Brogan ! - Roof clear ? - Nobody got past us . - Nobody came down the main elevator . - Damn it- - We lost him ! - Our double-Sided special comes with an EXTRA triple Topping- - - I 'm not orderin' a pizza . I 'm investigatin' a major felony , and we think one of your delivery guys is involved . - Like I say , that bike isn 't registered with us . We 've got no such bike , we got no such driver . But we do have a double-Sided extra special ! With a little something- - - aggh ! I hate pizza ! Put out an a.P.B on that bike , now ! Captain ? Check out the latest report from inter-Planetary . Could be linked to nissim 's murder . [ machine beeping ] - The gemini gang are making a run on the black crystal trade . - All across the quadrant . There 's dead crystal dealers from here to earth . They 're wiping out the competition on a dozen planets . - Including altor , it seems . And this one had this in his hand when he dropped in on us . - Black crystal , at least two ounces worth . - Ah , I 'd say it was closer to three , and supposedly , a single gram will extend a human 's life three years . - Huh , or a creon 's 20 . And an entire species extinct in order to get it . You could buy half of demeter with that rock . - Then why didn 't the killer take it ? - Because he didn 't care about crystal . He was after nissim . A real pro . - Nah , not that professional . He left a witness . - I met Mr. Nissim at the kafka club . He seemed nice , so I let him take me to his place ... just to talk . - When the killer attacked , what exactly did you see , miss amyas ? - Not much . There was a sound in the corridor . Mr. Nissim 's friends pulled out these big guns . Told me to get behind the curtains . I couldn 't see anything . But I could- - I heard them scream , so I- - - It 's all right , it 's all right . It 's all right . - You 're doing fine . Is there anything else you remember ? Anything you 'd like to tell us ? - Just I wish I 'd never come to demeter city . - Well , at least , demeter 's not Boring . - No , it 's not Boring . Tallis three , my home planet , that 's Boring . I wish I were there now . - Well , for right now , miss amyas , we 'd like you to stay in town ... At least until we finish our investigation . - You can call me " aleesha " If you want . - Only if you call me , " Jack . " - Stay here . We 'll be back in a couple of minutes . - How 's she read , tooki ? - Anxious , scared ... the way anybody would be . But beyond that , can 't tell you much . - that girl 's lucky to be alive . - Yeah , I think aleesha knows that . - " Only if you call me , ' Jack ? ' " - How 's our mystery girl feeling ? - Not very well . - She still can 't remember anything . And I haven 't found a single linguistic match with the symbols on her disk . - doesn 't look like any language I 've ever seen . What 's your guess , beezle ? - Well , there 's not a language . These might be mathematical symbols of some kind . Perhaps , it 's a data disk . - Hmm , sounds like a job for our walking computron . Hey , slomo , come to Papa ! Chow down , boy . [ speaking foreign language ] - What in space is he saying ? - That is megalese , the language of our people ! - Your people . - our people . We remember who we are , love . We are the queen of megalon seven . You will kiss our royal hand . [ speaking foreign language ] - Yank his power cells ! - Can 't do that ! We 'll wipe his memory bank to day one . - Well , press restart ! Press reset ! Press something ! [ Speaking foreign language ] - What is going on here ? - Uh , just a minor problem , sir . - Minor problem , huh ? You know how much these rsa units cost ? Fix it , or I 'll suspend the both of ya for a month ! Without pay ! - Do you need me to arrange transportation for you back to the hotel ? - No , thanks . I 'll just grab a transit . - Uh , that 's very pretty ... the , uh , pendant , I mean . - My father gave it to me . It represents the two sides of each of us . The good and the not so good . It 's a talisman against harm . - Well , I 'm glad I was workin ' tonight . - He 's at it again . - that 's what I like best about you , Officer haldane , you never let personal feelings color your judgment . - Really ? What else do you like about me ? - It 's a short list , haldane , and it 's getting Shorter by the minute . - It 's the last minute of the second half and we 're tied to two to two . I make it past the backs , the sweeper , the goalkeeper and I kick the ball right at the net . - And you win the game ? - No , way ! Goalkeeper 's a tarn . He used telekinesis to push the ball away from the net . - that 's cheating ! - Tell it to the ref . He 's a tarn , too . - Liz , where you been ? Dinner . - I was giving zill a bath . - Well , sit down and eat your dinner . Without zill , please . - But she loves to eat with us . - Yeah , well , I don 't love eatin ' with her . Listen to your mother . [ ringing ] Matt ? - Yo , Matt , you in the borough ? - Yo- - How 's it scanning ' , earth man ? - Smooth as space- - Warp me in .

To do what , Matt ? - Uh , special project . The two of us , inazy and I- - We 're working on it together . - You and inazy have been out every night this week . - It 's a big project . Bye . - Bye ! WOW ! All right ! - Let 's go ! - Don 't play with that . Eat ' em . It 's fine . It 's just- - It 's vegetables . Okay ? What 's wrong ? - What do you know about this inazy kid ? - Well , his parents live downtown at the coruthian commune . - What 's a human family doing in a coruthian commune ? - His parents tend the egg incubators . - What ? - It 's just for the next two years 'til their indentured service is up . - Indentured service , egg incubators . You know , I knew demeter was gonna be different from New York , but I didn 't think it 'd be this different . - I like it here- - It 's-It 's weird and fun . - From the mouths of babes . - there 's nothing normal here . - Well , at least zill 's normal . [ chattering ] - Hey ? Did you see the trivid reports on nissim ? - Oh . - Someone took out him and his whole gang . Who do you figure it was ? - I know nothing about nothing . And I don 't talk about it , neither . And I advise you to do the same . - Hey ? Who 's there ? Ow ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! - Cut him some Slack , Officer Brogan . Why are you always on Matt 's case about his friends ? - Not all his friends- - Just this inazy kid . How long 's he been going to Matt 's school ? - About a month- - They bus him up from downtown . His teacher thinks he 's fit in very Well , considering . - Considering what ? - Well , um , well , the downtown kids tend to be more violent . - That does it . I don 't want Matt hangin' with this inazy character anymore . - Patrick he 's- - - We 'll finish this later . Yeah ? - Hey , Brogan . We just answered a 187 down here in district nine . You 'll be interested in the particulars . - Go ahead . - We got a double-Sided special with an EXTRA triple Topping of lizard with black crystal on the side , and a dead dealer on the wall . - Looks like the same hitter who took out nissim is still at work- - Any leads ? - Just one . Central tracking 's got a lock on your mystery pizza bike . - Where ? - District six , headed your way . - Okay . This is the police ! Descend to ground level at once . Descend to ground level . - Yo , ha-Ha ! I hate it when they do that . - Whoa ! Come on ! Come on ! - Two-Four-Three point one , vc district six in progress . All units respond . [ honking ] - Whoa ! Remind me to give that jerk a ticket ! - Whoa ! Argh ! Whoa , ooh , argh , argh ! Oh ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - And I only had three more payments to go . I don 't know what he looks like . Xanac is just a voice on a blanked-Out screen . - Yeah , we 've heard of Mr. Xanac . - If you never saw him , how 'd you do your job ? - When he calls , I go to the car parked at the space port . That 's where I pick up my pizzas . - Which you then deliver all over town to a bunch of low-Lifes . - Yeah , and everyone of them a lousy tipper . - You had no idea you were movin ' black crystal ? - Hey , I never look in the boxes . Figured it wouldn 't be too good for my health , if you know what I mean ? - Mmm-Hmm- - Lemme guess ? You don 't know who 's knockin ' off all the dealers in town either , right ? - You must be part-Tarn , Officer . You read my mind . - So how does he read , took ? - He 's a creep , but he 's telling the truth . He 's strictly an errand boy . - Let 's make sure I got this right . Your ship was attacked , crew killed . You were sold into slavery on androm- - After three years- four years . - excuse me , four years . Four years on androm , you escaped . You hitched a ride on the freighter and ended up on altor . - It has been a difficult journey , but now , it is over . As soon as you contact our people , we will return home . - You know , um , your majesty , megalon seven is very , very far away and the cost of a Kunkel is rather high . - Yes ? - I 'm not authorized to make that kind of expenditure . - a way will be found . - How about a cup of coffee ? - cream , no sugar . - How 's her queenship ? - Lost in the ozone . She needs a major psych work-up . She 's rather sweet , though , in her own royal way . - Ah , it sounds like a job for social services . - Yeah , except they 're booked solid . So we 're stuck with her , until I track down a bed and a shelter . - Matt ! What are you doing here ? - Can we talk a sec , dad ? - Now ? I 'm workin ' here . - Yes , now ! - Sure . - What 's the problem , son ? - Mom says you want me to quit being friends with inazy . - Yep . - Why ? - ' cause you and your friend have been up to somethin ' all week and you won 't tell us what it is . - that 's right . And I want it to be okay with you . - Matt , I don 't like this . I don 't like it one damn bit . I saw you two and the stuff you had . Now what is it ? - I don 't want to tell you what it is . Not yet . It 's okay , anyway . I 'm asking you to trust me . - You 're askin ' a lot . - exactly . - Okay . You got it . - Great . Thanks , dad . - Liziral ? - Be right with you , lieutenant . - Brogan ? Listen to this . Aleesha , tell my partner what you just told me . - Well , I didn 't want to bother you . - No bother- - Go ahead . This morning , I remembered at the kafka club , where I met Mr. Nissim , he had an argument with this awful man . - and what did Mr. Nissim call this awful man ? - Xanac . Do you know him ? - Oh , yeah . He 's probably the biggest black crystal smuggler on the planet . - Then why haven 't you arrested him ? - Nobody knows what he looks like . - He changes his face , as often as the rest of us change our socks . - Yeah , and if we can 't I.D. Him , we can 't arrest him . - Well , I can help . I mean I know what xanac looks like , this week , anyway . - Would you excuse us ? I know what you 're thinkin and I don 't like it . Look , Brogan , xanac is Public enemy number one . Aleesha can help us nail him . - Mmm-Hmm . You 're lettin ' your hormones get the best of you , haldane . - You really want to take her out in the field ? - She 's game ! I mean , come on , Brogan- - What choice do we have ? Xanac 's either behind the other two murders , or he 's the next target . - according to this pizza guy , xanac 's current base of operation is in this area . - Wait a minute- - We got company . - Anybody look familiar ? - That 's him ! The one in the green jacket ! He was the one that nissim called " Xanac " at the kafka club . - that 's good enough for me . - Stay put . - But , Jack ! - Right now , he 's officer haldane . - Looks like xanac 's got his very own pizzeria here . - Ugh , complete with live maggots . - cover ! - No tracks ! No prints ! - I 've never seen a cleaner crime scene . - If you don 't count the blood ? - Yeah . Oh , great , podly- - Just what we need . - Central control unit 12 , report vector locations . - Additional officers required . - Unit twelve , en route down town- - - This doesn 't bother you ? - Yeah . It does bother me . I try not to let it show . - All units code Blue- - Demeter city westside . - Hey , c 'mon . - All units code blue . - We need to talk . - Okay . - You were the only ones there ? - Yeah , the girl stayed in the car . She didn 't see anything . - We figured the perp went out the back way . - So we can 't identify the hitter , or even establish if there was a hitter . - Establish if there was a hitter ? - Do I need to draw a picture ? We have no arrests , we have no suspects ! And the only fellas present at the crime scene- - - Are always the same pair of street cops . - Mayor 's Office is startin ' to ask questions . And the word on the street is that two of my guys Have gone rogue . - Come on , captain- - Are you trying to tell us you think that we killed those two scumbags ? - Get some results and soon , or what I think won 't matter . - Heavy traffic in-Bound- - Use caution . - Hi , big news flash from the Matt front . - Yeah ? - Yeah . You got to get home at a decent hour , though . Apparently , all will be revealed tonight . - Uh , I 'll try , okay ? - All right , slomo , it 's showtime . Come on , boy , say somethin ' - - do something , anything . - Officer beezle , how do you want to handle this ? Payroll deduction , or credit transfer ? - Huh ? - All these interstellar dispatches logged to your account . You 're the department of pile of cash , pal . - Sixty-Two thousand credits worth of dispatches to megalon seven From my number ! You had to feed slomo that cockamamie disk , and now he 's making interstellar calls on my account ! - I hope you 're satisfied ! - Good morning ! What 's happened- - And where am I ? Reverse- - Forward- - Stop . - Look , if you change your mind about leavin ' , I would love to show you some of the nice parts of demeter . - Can we go see the first settlers fortress ? - And the fabulous cave mountains . - Hey , haldane ! I got some news on our vanishing hit man ! - It would be more appropriate to say that we have some news . - And if you haven 't noticed , slomo 's talkin ' again . - Right- - What about the hitman ? - I put slomo to work on our black crystal killer . He cross-Referenced every interplanetary file and murders with similar mos . Came up with some Surveillance sticks from xania taken two months ago . Poor quality , but with some luck and a lot of computer enhancement , we 'll know what our killer looks like before the end of the shift . - Good work . Look , do you mind hangin' around a little bit . Takin ' a look at orrin 's pictures ? - Not at all . - Officer orrin , you have now exceeded Maximum allotted break time . - Anyone ever tell you you 're no fun , slomo . - Yeah .

Rattlin ' a few cages , huh ? - Give it a rest , haldane . - You know , that 's what I like best about you , Officer castle . You never let your personal feelings color your judgment . - Run ' em in sequence . One more time . Hold it . Go back one . Make it two . There ! We haven 't played with this one .

Get back to the main office . Go on- - I 'll be all right . - How is he ? - Deep in coma six . Slomo 's in an even worse state . - Slomo ? - Apparently , he got between orrin and the killer . Only thing that saved him . - I back you on the street for seven years , and you go and get nailed right here in the station house ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm on emergency stand-By . Podly thinks I 'm part of a conspiracy to knock off crystal smugglers , orrin 's in e.C. , then my partner 's fallen for an alien who lives god knows how many light years away . All in all , I 'd rather be in philadelphia . - Ahh . But you 're here for your family . - Hey , dad ! - Yo , Mr. Brogan !

We 'll be performing in front of all the kids and their parents . - I wouldn 't miss it for the world . - Hey , look everybody ! I 'm happy ! Now I 'm sad ! Happy , sad ! - My father gave it to me .

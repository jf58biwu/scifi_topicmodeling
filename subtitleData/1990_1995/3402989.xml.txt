 MOON 47th - MINING OPERATION IN THE OUTERZONE . BY THE YEAR 2038 ALL NATURAL RESOURCES ON EARTH HAVE BEEN DEPARTED . MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE UNIVERSE NOW A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR RAGES . RIVAL COMPANIES FIGHT DEADLY BATTLES OVER PRICELESS MINING PLANETS IN OUTER SPACE . ... we are under the attack by Pirites . The final analysis of systems shows that their jets of robots can be controlled . I repeat the Pirites are robots . Do you read me ? We all will be killed . Mayday ... mayday . At least we finally know what we are dealing with . - Any survivors ? - No chance . So what 's been done about it ? Pirites captures all our moons after another - ... and we are going broke.Those bastards ... - I 've warned you before . We can 't defend the mining operation if you keep cuting my budget ! We 're not a military operation like Pirite . Our money are spent to research , equipment ... There are no alternatives left . We have to defend ourselves , do we not ? We 're listening . They 've already captured 51 , 46 and 47 . The only one left up there is Moon 44 . He will certainly Pirites next target . It 's ironic we already had a working defence system up there , and you cancelled it . Because too many pilots got killed in training . Those pilots we are having the navigate an extreme weather conditions . - Pirite obviously manage to deal with that . - And so with my men . Two weeks ago I 've send up a new group of navigators . They will make a hell of lot safer for the Pirites . Look , Stevens . Your " navigators " are barely after teens . - They are kids . - I 've tested them , they are the best . What I 'm having a hell of a time finding pilots no one wants to volunteer for the outerzone anymore . We had to send up prisoners . Convicts ? You 're puting our prime assets in the hands of prisoners ... - teens and computer freaks ? - Baker is right . As usual . He can 't afford to take chances . But I already certain precautions . Let me remind everyone what is state here is not Moon 44 , but our mining shuttles . Without them , Galactic Mining is finished . That 's why I 've ordered the station commander of Moon 44 to launch all shuttles at the first sign of attack . You gave him control of the shuttles ? But what about the crew ? Mr Chairman , their only chance to escape is sitting a ride on the shuttles . I 'm afraid that 's impossible . They have to stay and fight . - But they will be masacred . - We 're all making our sacrifices . Or would you prefere to encourage Pirite , to go on and on with this take over ? Ladies and Gentlemen ... Mr Chairman ? Moon 44 . We have a problem . Contact the Internal Affairs imediately . Get me their best agent . No one gonna go in a mission like that . It would be a suicide . Even an Internal Affair 's agent doesn 't need to know everything . Yes , sir . Welcome to Western ... a Galactic Mining I repeat : All 55B8 passengers are asked , leaving the space shuttle ... the security checkpoint B2 to happen . - Rising shine , we 're at home . - Fuck you ! You know something , Lieutenant ? You 've got a real atitude problem . Unlock me . Or you gonna have a real problem . Fuck up and I 'll take you with me , I swear it . ... go to control Item 7 . Dad , look ! - Come on ! - But that man ... - Felix Stone . - I.A. I know who you are . Who is he ? Well , he is Lieutenant Gallagher . You guys are never change . It was not even loaded ? You 're crazy ! You 're nuts , God damn bull you pig ! Someone should kaltmachen Register ! Can you hear me ? - You really enjoy this sheet , don 't you ? - No . Galactic Mining wants you enjoy your staying but reminds you to be cautious do not reveal the nature or location of your asignments to strangers . Report any of irregularities or suspicions to the Internal Affairs . THE YEAR 2038 GALACTIC MINING HEADQUARTERS You were full three months out there . - How did you find and catch him ? - What 's the difference ? I 've got him . - What is this ? - Keep back for your next job . That you probably would have gladly . Stone , this is Stevens from Headquarter by the central administration . We wannna see you immediately when you arrive . We have asked the Internal Security your immediate effect exemption . This is a top priority . Hunters have Flight Academy With awards . - Have you been flown ? - No . Why ... ? Why did you quit the military ? I 'm not very good in taking orders . Then what made you join the Internal Affairs ? It gives me a free hand there . Why then have several applications on early dismissal ? I 've arrested and locked them up they let it get out again . But your prisons they only make things worse . - There is no way to change people . - Then they have to do something about it . You wanna quit for ... classical literature to study . What 's is all about ? Is this an interrogation ? No ! We have a proposition for you , mr Stone . A critical assignment . You 'll completed and we guarantee the early cancellation of from your contract . You can then do what you want . I 'm listening . Moon 44 . The most important mining operation in the galaxy . Over 100 mining shuttles operate there . Robots , machineries worth billions . They dig on the clock , fill up ... millions of tones of all material back here and we 're converting into solid fuel . It is our prime income . Our pride . Recently , mr . Stone , very strange things happened . Someone tempered without very existence ... two of these magnificent shuttles dissapared in transit . We thought that it is a technical defect . But to our surprise ... we learned that they were stolen . We have reliable information from a navigator station from Moon 44 . - His name is Tyler . - Looks young . We want you to go up and investigate . - Where 's the catch ? - Catch ? There is no catch . But you have to go undercover in the group of prisoners they 're in training to become fighter pilots . - Are you expecting an attack ? - Certainly not . It is nearly a routine training exercise . Well , mr . Stone , do we have a deal ? Jake O 'Neal , Scooter Bailey ! Come out ! If time that we get rid of you ! Los Haggerty , moving your black ass ! Come on , move out ! - See you ! - Come on , let 's do it ! All right , fall me ! You asshole , you think you hit a jackpot ! That will be determined no holiday ! You gonna lick my stick to get in here again ! You are clear to land . Don 't push me ! Welcome to Moon 44 . One of Galactic Mining valuable resources , for solid fuel . The output for a year amount is 1.7 million ... Do you know this guy ? - Lewis , who is the Einstein ? - I 've never saw him before . Galactic Mining wish you a nice stay . Approaching base . ready to open doors . Let 's go . - The new pilots are here . - No , man , finally new customers . - You 're sick ! Do you know that ? - Thank you ! Hey , highly with you !

Do exactly as you are told and you are leave here free men . Screw up and you 'll be send back to prison for to remain into carceration . Jake O 'Neal . A very serious boy . Stealing military jets . - Murder one . - Self defence . Is that so ? Do you really think that I care ? Put that damn cigarette out ! Well , mr . Stone . I see that you were an ex fighter pilot . Refuse the orders . Insubordination . Are you some kind of tough guy ? - Maybe . - Shut up ! Now you listen to me , sheet head ! And you listen good , I 've been hold my breath for a long time for somebody like you . Do you have anything to say about that ? Answer me when I talk to you . I think you got me confuse with somebody you take you serious . Shut up , god damn it until you piece me off ! - Man has got the death wish . - Nu . The man got balls . I does not need any boots , what I need to fuck . Hey , great ! You can get just right ! That 's enough . This is your Station commander , major Lee . May I talk to you , major ? - Bring it to the room mate . - Yes . You 've heard it ! Why send the Company our prisoners ? Welcome to the real world . Listen , it 's a company decision . Prisoners are cheaper than pilots . Our lives depend of these people ! - It was not my decision . - But how can you accept that ? You should just take it easy . Everything is gonna work out ok . Sergeant ! Sir ? Put Stone on the first training flight . With pleasure . Hi ! Welcome to Moon 44 . - My name is Tyler . - Shit ! We only have one air conditioning in the back . Great . Hi .

Yes , give me again the coordinates . B32-X . Full ready to talk . More to the left . Gentlemen , step this way , please ! Ok , now listen up . Stay cool , concentrate , you just let Tyler take care of rest . - I just try ... - Attempt the red button . - With the start . - The red switch . I am impressed . Okay . Listen up ! Our defence system is based ... on the perfect interraction between pilot and the navigator . Both have a unit . Only we risk out there our lives . Your lives depends on you listening to these guys . - Great . - Ready ? Right . Ready . I 'm counting on you . Put the baby high . Take it easy , cowboy . Now will demonstrate what the guy really has it . Not bad . Stay possible in the gorges . Just stay away from the narrows of canyon . Roger . - I see nothing ! - There you have me . I am so to speak your eyes and ears . Test , a sense for the bird to get . Okay , good . And now left . Exactly . Stop the machine on the level . - Okay . - Is too low . Pull up ! - Do you understand ? - Yes , but . - Watch a robot , straight ahead . - What a robot ? Up , god damn it , up ! Take it easy . Almost missed . I was a near hit . You steer on a rock wall !

You were not so bad . - What do you know ? - Over flying everything . What the hell is going on up there , huh ? Only idiots do the job still voluntary . Since they had to you fall back on . If I would you , I would be there failed to come where you are . - Oh , and why ? - Galactic Mining ... a commodity moon after the other lost . Surprise attacks . Right massacre . And no one knows who 's war . They don 't even know how was happened , cause no survivors . - How do you like that ? - I don 't . You 're the snitch , huh ? - I 'm not a snitch . - Your name is Tyler , isn 't it ? What do you know about the hijackings ? So you are the specialist ? I have a specialist expected ! You know : Cool , inconspicuous . None of permanently in the shit happens . Tell me what you know and then let me alone . And what is in it for me ? What do you want ? I 've discovered that someone is stealing the mining shuttles , right ? I have the evidence . That must be you but what its worth , right ? - Parts we fifty-fifty . - From what ? Is it not a bonus Kamikaze for jobs like here ? Partner ? Hi , guys ! What 's up ? Nothing , serge , I was just debriefing Stone . - About what ? - About the training flight , sir . - Do you think you 're funny , don 't you ? - No . - I mean , do you think I was funny ? - No . You 're not funny , I 'm funny ! - Ignore him , don 't show him you 're scared . - But I 'm scared .. We can not ignore it . What we need to invade . And what exactly is it you wanna do ? First of all , I 'm gonna try to make some money with them . - What happened to us , but you do not care . - Oh man Is a tough world up there . I 'm just a business man trying to survive , that 's all . Hau . - You 're lost ? - No , I 'm not lost . I want you to propose a business . I am the cookie man . The medicine man . I Uppers , Downers Yellow and Blue , everything fun . - Cookie Man got it . - Get a hell out of here . We 're not junkies . Yeah , I about of you claims ? But here it may sometimes quite uncomfortable . Because I thought , I offer you something for relaxation . Shit Head , get your pills out from my face . Fighter pilot , I 've place for you ! - I am talking to you ! - No , you talk with you yourself Listen up ! In order to show you that " discipline " For me , no empty concept , I 've decided to honour our new fighter pilot with KP . And our brand mister Wisenheimer here he 's going to show him the ropes . Who , me ? A week is , of course , not punishment enough . That is why we need help our service to their friends memorable as possible . Gentlemen . So what are you waiting for ? Well , Tyler ? What about when you me bring something to eat ? Yes , sir . Immediately , sir . Do not exaggeration a little , Sykes ? On this menu he is still a long think . I 'm trying to maintain discipline here . Aha . Obviously one thing , by the You do not understand too much . Beeing a civilian ... and a woman . If you 're such a great leader of men how come you 're not an officer , Sykes ? I mean ... what is in your career wrong , Sergeant ? A shot from my good old special sauce . This tastes exactly as Mama . A few potatoes , and already he shits Tonight the soul from the body . Evidence ? These are just numbers . Bring but equal a circular out ! The mathematics is high , man That is not all . Who can because the same in all cards ? Ähh ! Pass it on , you have made it very wet . Oh , oh ! What we have there ? Spices ! Mmm . - Where is my food ? - I 'm coming ! Dinner for One . Bon appetit , Serge . Crap ! Tz , TZ . You want to get rid of me . Wide , you will not come . As a professional burglar ... you just need professional tools . Maybe I will after you conveniently leave . Only with the rest . It must first warm up . The head office of course not believe in theft . Who steals already Industrial Robots with several thousand tons of weight ? But they will not disappear by technical defect . They were stolen . Why are you so sure there ? Am I the only one here the expected ? That is all simple mathematics . Mining shuttle number 112 left a week ago no one heards Since then disappeared . The probability that he lost is about to 1 : 14,959 . This means that perhaps one all 45 years disappear . - Not every month , as at present . - What are the tax units ? Each controls a mining shuttles . Monitors work and return transport . The robots are controlled from here ... and still not achieve its goal ? Then there are traces of manipulation ! - Nothing doing ! - Why ? Because they are so constructed , that this is not possible . The only thing I can calculate , , which as next stolen . Since we have no 117th 115th .. 117th Here . Allright . Do you see this number ? That means in 24 hours , 117 stop digging and take off . Hey , Stone ! Where are you going ? Wait me , man ! Well , what do you think about the matter ? Stay out of this , kid , I 'll take care from now . Hey , tell me what you plan ! We are partners ! I 've shown you everything ! - So what ? Stone ! I 'm scared . I 've got to get out of here , man . They have virtually me fetched from the street . The gave me the Blue from heaven promised . And I have the same idiot signed for two years . I didn 't expect this . I thought I I help the Company , and for that lassen sie mich aus dem Vertrag . - Yes , possible . - We will certainly soon attacked . I don 't wanna die here . This is already half of my premium . Man , forget the bonus ! What do you say ? - Tomorrow . - I count on you ! Where are you going , pretty boy ? Leave me alone ! Do you like me ? Oh , how pity . But perhaps you like one of my friends . Let the weak sense , Scooter ! For me , much too thin ! In prison we have from young boys as you can only dream of . We make a nice pretty girl . You know yet what the like . Have I right guys ? That 's enough . He 's savvy . - No , he is just shy . - Come , let him run . Why dont 't you get out of here ? - You will have to get used to turn . - Do not go ! Please ! - Shut up ! - No ! No ! - If there 's a problem , Sergeant ? - I 've just saw Stone in shuttle 's control ! Yes , so what ? Department of Homeland Security . Holy shit . And what do we Stone when we discovered ? Then just what invade . Accidents sometimes happen . You are not serious ! I mean , I might let me to a theft convince but I will not murderers ! - Men , come . You have probably forgotten how the Company umgesprungen with you ! What we guard here ? The damned Förderroboter ... the Company are important as all our lives ! That I think not . - No ? You know because not what command I get ? The Company has given us but long enough shitty . It is time , to turn the tables . Marc ! What happened ? Leave me alone . - Who did this to you ? - Don 't touch me ! Hey , I 'm sorry ! God damn it ! These pigs will pay for it . That I swear to you . All helicopters ready . Attention ! Helicopter prepare for training flight . We now the practice teams . Team 1 : Haggerty and Williamson . Team 2 : Niels and Dobson . Team 3 : Bailey and Tahoe . Let 's go through the checklist . Okay . - Number 5 , Patrick . - All the functions are checked . - All systems go ? - Work correctly . Now I will show the types of times , what is fly . Make sure that all weapons systems are secured . Repeat : All weapons systems and secure . This is only a simulated attack . The weather conditions are still the circumstances . Maximum wind speed is 120 miles per hour . There is , above visibility conditions . ARMED Well , what 's you today ? Do we both not a good team ? - What do you mean ? - Put high . - Are you ready for video games ? . - Ready . - Keep radio contact with the ground . - Pull the chest high . How are you today because we ? Out of my leadership ! - But we are now partners ! Fucking piss in this drug freak navigator . I can business and leisure well separated . So , pull the chest high . Direction . Regard . And sharp right now . Have you not heard ? I said right ! - Tyler , give me some news ! - Jake is right behind you . Jake O 'Neal . How are you doing so , Jake ? I equal ! - ' N shock prayer ! - Okay , and now up again . Rock formation , 11-3 ahead watch out ! - Great ! - Damn it ! - That 's not a video game , it 's serious ! - I can not shake off ! Where I come from , what do you call it fly ! Pull up , man ! - I 've got an idea . - Why do not hear times . - On my character , steep upward . - Right . Now we have them ! Maintenance calm the box ! Still , I say ! Yes , good ! - If you build manure , you 're it ! - Already clear . Still stop now ! Steady . - Ready . - I 've got it right in the cross . Okay , Stone . - Road to hell ! - Now ! - What was that ? - Get a hell out of here ! - Shit ! - O 'Neal , cease fire immediately ! Stone , you 're allright ? All clear . - Stone , are you really okay ? - The circumstances , mrs Morgan . Since when has a training helicopter sharp ammunition on board ? This is Sykes ' responsibility . He is the best training sergeant I 've got . Well . And why he treated the recruits like shit , Major ? I don 't know . I have to ask him . Sykes . Yes , sir . That was wrong . Any other suggestion ? Just be calme and down . I have an idea . You take care of next shuttle , and I 'll take care of Stone . Sergeant ... Do not be a face . I 've got everything under control . - Slow down . - You know I like it fast . Come on , honey ! Stop this bullshits ! Well , what is happening ? War I now more juice ? Okay . Do you want fast ? What you can have . Na finally ! So , I 've liked . Yes , that 's good . Yes ! Hey , hey , that 's enough , baby . Hey , what should that be ? Come on , come me back right now . Marc , he get the idea . Hey , what are you doing ? Slow , you little son of a bitch ! I turn you around the neck ! Marc , listen to so immediately , have you heard ? - Listening to you jerky ... - Marc ! Listening ! - Marc ! Why ? One more active revenge , and I send you all back to prison . I am responsible for the discipline . And I will also condemned again ! I am not your dancing on the nose around ! Excuse me , sergeant . - May I please talk to the men ? - Who the hell do you think ? They are responsible for this incident . Had you not the air traffic control leave about the man is still alive . You want me something responsibility to tell ? Then they say to me why was armed O 'Neals machine ! That was your responsibility , isn 't it ? - What do you say ? - Sergeant Sykes ! Let them talk . Listen all . Surely none of you will back to prison . Therefore , there is only a single alternative . You should the as a regrettable accident . Accident ? Should the ' n joke be ? Scooter was killed ! Bullshit ! Everyone knows Marc what he pleased . - Scooter the war has begun . - You think your foot ! - Cessation ! - Quit ! Listen here , lady . How stupid do you think ? You 've killed a lot of pilots long before we 've got here ! We are not come here to die . I am sorry for Scooter . But you have to you together . Otherwise , we lost in the attack . Who refuses to fly goes back to prison . Anyone who wants to continue , should come forward . Get it done ! If one of my men again what happens , you are tuned ! - Do you understand ? - Hey , Hey ! When you return to heroes want to play , I make you cold . - Have you tried it earlier . - That was an accident . If I had really Register want to kill you , would you dead Bring to Marc in the cell ? Please let me are . He needs a little encouragement . He is not a bad guy . I wish him only his music . He simply gets no bite down without his opera music . Personally , this is nothing for me . Scheißkunst ! I get up dancing . Serge . Serge , listen to me . I promised his mother , I will take care of him , you know ? Thank you . Thank you , Serge . I will never forget you . Marc ! I hope you 're hungry ! Get immediate help ! But fast ! Marc ! Why did you do that ? Why did you do that ? Why ? - We need your help . - These are but new tones . This is not a game .

Let 's do not this again . Okay ? Our crew has Pirite inflicted heavy losses ... and fought until the last . But ... at the end of the moon was taken 44 . There were no survivors . Until now there is no trace on the whereabouts of shuttles . Hundreds of huge shuttles can not simply disappear ! Have you to a search party thought it ? In the Outer Zone ? Forget it . Our gamble didn 't pay off . We are done . Is that what you call a gamble ? Stone ! Where are the shuttles ? - Where is Lee ? - He is dead . He was sold out to the Pirites . I don 't believe you Your commands have him insane Pirites straight into arms driven ! He was my most trusted officer . - I even told you are comming ! - How could you do something stupid ? What happened to our shuttles , Mr. Stone ? They are right here . Programmed by Lee . They were in a safe place parked . Free for Pirite . We have to thank you , mr Stone You saved our company . Wrong , Mr. Hall . The crew has rescued you . Remember them ? These people already written off . Sometimes there is no other choice . Oh yes ? There is always a choice . - You 'll never get away with this . - Don 't do it ! Why are you at once so concerned about human life ? I thought you only interested in for your hard assets . Please , I beg you , Do not destroy our future . Where are you going ? I guess I 'm out of the job .

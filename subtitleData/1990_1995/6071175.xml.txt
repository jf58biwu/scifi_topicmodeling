He is Superboy . [ music continues ] [ flute music ] [ flute music ] [ groaning ] [ tires screeching ] [ crash ] [ flute music ] [ explosion ] ( Clark ) You are not gonna die . You hear me ? [ music continues ] [ coughs ] [ ambulance siren blaring ] Be seeing you . [ music continues ] ( boy # 1 ) Have you really been to India , Aunt Cassandra ? ( Cassandra ) Mmm-hmm . And Africa ? And China , and Egypt and all sorts of wonderful places . I wanna go to all those places , too . Believe me , Clark , you will . You 'll do things that most people only imagine . I can tell . I wanna go everywhere . I wanna understand all there is in-in the whole world . - Impossible . - Not for me . What 's real in life , what 's truest is so huge and beautiful that our minds can 't ever understand . I can do it . Well , then , maybe you 'll be the one who will . But don 't be surprised when things in life are bigger than you . And learn to take joy in the mystery . ( Lana ) Mr. Clark ? Mr. Clark ? Come in , Clark . Oh , hi , Lana . You know , it seems like you 're living on another planet . Funny , I haven 't thought of her in years . Who ? - My Aunt Cassandra . - Cassy , the kook ? Her name was Cassandra , and she wasn 't a kook . Her name was Cassy . And you were the only one in Smallville who didn 't think she was totally out there . Even your mother knew . And she 's her sister . Aunt Cassandra helped me to see who I am . And what I can do with my life . Oh , please , Clark . Every few years she 'd blow into town like a twister and fill your little head full of clouds and then , whirl off into the unknown . I mean , talk about someone who lives in a different planet . Lana , are you through ? Clark , it was just a joke . I like your Aunt Cassy . Cassandra . Whatever . Didn 't she move away to Paris , what , about ten years ago ? That 's what we heard . But nobody knows for sure . I wonder why she popped into my head now .. [ flute music ] - You hear that ? - What ? [ music continues ] Come on , guys , follow the leader . - I 'm gonna get you . - No , you ain 't . Oh , man ! We 'll go across here . - That 's crazy . - Chicken ! Well , you know , Clark .. Clark ? [ dramatic music ] Alright . Now , you go . It 'd be too bad if we 've to tell the guys you 're a chicken . [ music continues ] I think it 's gonna give . Stand still . Don 't move . Go get some help , you moron ! Hurry , I don 't think I can hold on much longer . Just don 't wriggle around . Just stand still . [ music continues ] Aah ! [ music continues ] You are real . You were there at the bridge last night . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Be seeing you . [ intense music ] ( young Clark ) Look at 'em all , Aunt Cassandra . There 's so much stuff out there . Makes me dizzy . That enormous universe out there .. ... it 's alive . And if you learn to trust it really trust it it 'll take better care of you than you could ever take care of yourself . It 'll help you to fly . Higher than you 've ever dreamed . ( man on TV ) In New York today ... You mean nobody knows where she is ? How about Cousin Bee ? She was always so close to Cassandra . Right , Cassy . But if you 'd call around , ma , I 'd really- - I don 't know . I 've just been thinking about her . Yeah , thanks . I love you , too . ( man # 2 on TV ) ... live coverage now , of the fire on the Westside . The fire began about 30 minutes ago . A poor forlorn fire at the Rhodes Nursing Home . The blaze is currently out of control and firefighters .. [ flute music ] [ coughing ] ( firefighter ) Okay , that 's the last of ' em . Let 's get outta here . [ coughing ] [ glass shattering ] Somebody ... help ! You 'll be alright . [ flute music ] You didn 't think I 'd forget you , did you ? You 're responsible for this , aren 't you ? The responsibility is yours . You keep trying to cheat me . And you 'll pay the price . You 'll pay the price . No ! I can 't ! [ laughing ] You 're fast ! You don 't know the half of it . - What ? - Nothing . - Aunt Cassandra . - Hmm ? How come you 're so brave ? You go all around the world all by yourself And you never get scared of anything . Of course , I do . - Really ? - Mmm-hmm . Then I just remind myself that fear is a just a paper wall . Just part of the game . Gotta push right through it . Game ? What do you mean ? It 's like when you and your friends play army or pirates or outer space don 't you believe it so much sometimes that you scare yourselves ? And sometimes , don 't you enjoy the scary parts best of all ? Well , I think life 's a lot like that . It 's a game , Clark . The most spectacular game there is . And even when it scares the pants off of you especially when it scares the pants off of you you 've gotta take joy in it . Joy ? In being scared ? Joy in everything , Clark ! [ chuckling ] I 'm gonna get you , Clark ! - No , you 're not ! - I am . Come here ! [ telephone ringing ] [ ringing continues ] Yeah , Clark Kent . Cousin Bee ! Yeah , I 've been trying to get a hold of you for days now . Ma , too ? What ? Yeah , hold on . Yeah , I know . She could 've moved ten times by now but this-this is a start . Yeah , me , too . Next time I 'm home . Thanks , Cousin Bee ! Thanks . Listen , I was wondering if you could help me with this- - Lana , do me a favor ? Cover for me ? I always do . [ theme music ] Excuse me , have you seen this lady over here ? Sorry . Are you sure you don 't know her ? I told you , I 've never seen the lady . Come on , this is such a small town . You must have- - It may be a small town to you . I got business to deal with . [ flute music ] Think about it . This is important . Please . I 've never seen her . I 've never heard of her . Excuse me ? Have you seen this lady ? Could be . But I can 't really say for sure . If it 's the woman I think it is , I hear she 's been real sick . Do you know where she lives ? No , but I bet Mrs. Cooper will be able to help you out . Thank you . Got it . She 's been renting the Archon place . Oh , about 15 miles outside town . Mrs. Cooper , I-I could kiss you . Oh ! [ pleasant music ] [ swooshing ] Ahem ! Come in . [ melancholic music ] Clark ! I knew you 'd come . Prayed for it . You 've grown into quite a man . How are you ? How do I look ? Cancer ? The doctors gave me this therapy , that therapy . Tried to prove to me how wonderful medical science is . Needless to say , I 'm not convinced . You 'll beat this . I 'm tired , Clark . I don 't wanna fight anymore . I can 't . You 're not going to die . I can help you . You 've already helped me . Just by being here . But there are things I can do . I 'm sure , but .. [ flute music ] What 's that music ? It 's so beautiful . You can hear it , too ? I 've been hearing it for weeks now . Well , you 're not gonna hear it anymore . I 'll be right back . Why go after her ? If it 's me you want , then come and get me . I 'm never after anybody . I simply take what 's mine . She 's not yours , and she never will be . Whatever you are , I 've beat you before , and I 'll do it again . You never beat me . The man at the bridge the boy the old man it wasn 't their time . Why 're you doing this ? What pleasure can this give you ? No pleasure . When a soul 's time 's come , I simply do what has to be done . After all , that 's death 's job . [ intense music ] Death ? [ wind blowing ] [ intense music ] ( Cassandra ) Clark ? That is you , isn 't it , Clark ? [ melancholic music ] How can it be ? Remember what I said to you all those years ago ? The universe is bigger than you can ever dream . Bigger even than Superboy . And it can 't be understood . So you just trust it , and let it take care of you . We can 't trust her . She 's evil , Aunt Cassandra . She fought me every step of- - Don 't you understand ? She answered the cry of my heart . She played the game , Clark . The way that you 're .. The way that Superboy is suppose to be playing the game . Why do you think you were the only one who could hear her ? She was leading you to me . So I could say goodbye . I have to go now . No . Yes , Clark . Aren 't you afraid ? A little . Maybe a lot . But what fun would the game be if I wasn 't ? Into the mystery . [ pleasant music ] Be seeing you . [ flute music ] [ melancholic music ] ( young Clark ) Joy ? In being scared ? ( Cassandra ) Joy in everything , Clark . Joy in everything ! [ pleasant music ] [ theme music ]

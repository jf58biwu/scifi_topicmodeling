 Everybody , heads up ! Heads up ! Keep clear ! Keep it clear ! Okay , down ! Andale , si ! Vamonos . Keep it goin ' ! Come on ! That 's good , stay ! Slow it down . No lo vayan a tirar ! Cuidado ! Traigala , traigala ! Okay , pushing team , move in there . Move it ! Cuidado , vamos ! I want tasers on full charge . Aaah ! Come on , step back in . Move it ! Adelante ! Puje , puje ! And push ! We 're locked . Loading team , step away . Gate keeper ! Jophery , raise the gate . Aaah ! Aaah ! Block the opening ! Don 't let her get out ! Aaah ! Aaah ! Work her back ! Aaah ! Shoot her ! Shoot her ! Aaah ! Apuesto mil pesos que se cae . Hola , Juanito . Hola . Bienvenido . What 's this I hear at the airport ? Hammond 's not even here ? He sends his apologies . We are facing a $ 20-million lawsuit by the family of that worker , and you 're telling me that Hammond can 't even be bothered to see me ? He wants to be with his daughter . She 's getting a divorce . I understand that , but we 've been advised to deal with the situation now . The insurance company - Okay ? The underwriters feel that the accident has raised ... some very serious safety questions about the park . That makes the investors very , very anxious . I had to promise to conduct a very thorough on-site inspection . Hammond hates inspections . They slow everything down . Juanito , they 'll pull the funding . Jefe , jefe ! That 'll slow him down more . Encontramos otros mosquitos . Seguro ? A ver , muestrame . Si , venga . Ooh ! Aaah ! Watch your head . If two experts sign off on the island , the insurance guys will back off . I 've already got Ian Malcolm , but they think he 's too trendy . They want Alan Grant . Grant ? You 'll never get him out of Montana . Luz , mas luz ! Why not ? Muchachos , echenme luz ! Si . Why not ? Because Grant 's like me . He 's a digger . Que lindo eres . Vas a ser - Dr. Grant , Dr. Sattler , we 're ready to try again . I hate computers . The feeling 's mutual . You 'll get a reading from that . Take a look . Did it work ? How long does this take ? It should bring an immediate return . You shoot the radar into the ground , and the bone bounces the image back . Bounces it back . This new program 's incredible . A few more years 'development , and we won 't even have to dig anymore . Where 's the fun in that ? It 's a little distorted , but I don 't think it 's the computer . Oh . Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments . Velociraptor ? Yes , good shape too . It 's five , six feet high , I 'm guessing nine feet long . Look at the extraordinary - What 'd you do ? He touched it . Dr. Grant 's not machine compatible . Hell , they 've got it in for me . And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrist . It 's no wonder these guys learned how to fly . No , seriously . Well , maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds ... than they do with reptiles . Look at the pubic bone , turned backward , just like a bird . Look at the vertebrae , full of air sacs and hollows , just like a bird . And even the word " raptor " means " bird of prey . " That doesn 't look very scary . That kid 's a pistol . More like a six-foot turkey . A turkey , huh ? Oh , no . Here we go . Okay , try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period . You get your first look at this six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing . He moves like a bird , lightly bobbing his head . And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity ... is based on movement , like T-Rex , and he 'll lose you if you don 't move . But no , not Velociraptor . You stare at him , and he just stares right back . And that 's when the attack comes . Not from the front , but from the side . From the other two raptors you didn 't even know were there . Because Velociraptor 's a pack hunter , you see . He uses coordinated attack patterns , and he is out in force today . And he slashes at you with this , a six-inch retractable claw , like a razor , on the middle toe . He doesn 't bother to bite your jugular like a lion , say . No , no . He slashes at you here or here . Oh , Alan . Or maybe across the belly , spilling your intestines . The point is , you are alive when they start to eat you . So you know , try to show a little respect . Okay . Hey , Alan , if you wanted to scare the kid , you could have pulled a gun on him , you know . Yeah , I know . Kids . You want to have one of those ? I don 't want that kid . But a breed of child , Dr. Grant , could be intriguing . I mean , what 's so wrong with kids ? Oh , Ellie , look . They 're noisy , they 're messy , they 're expensive . Cheap , cheap . They smell . They do not smell . Give me a break ! Some of them smell . Babies smell . Cover the site ! Cover up the dig ! Tell them to shut down ! Shut down ! Cut the machine ! Cover it all up ! Pull it over ! Just cut it , will ya ? Cut it out ! Shut it down ! What ? What the hell do you think you 're doing in here ? Hey , we were saving that ! For today . I guarantee it . Who in God 's name do you think you are ? John Hammond , and I 'm delighted to meet you finally in person , Dr. Grant . Mr. Hammond - Well , I can see that my , uh , 50,000 a year has been well spent . Okay , who 's the jerk ? Uh , this is our paleobotanist , Dr. - Sattler . Aha ! Ellie , this is , uh , Mr. Hammond . I 'm sorry about the dramatic entrance , Dr. Sattler , but we 're in a wee bit of a hurry . Did I say " jerk " ? Will you have a drink ? We won 't let it get warm . Come along , sit down . Here , let me - I 'll just get a glass or two . No , no , no , no , I can manage this . I know my way around the kitchen . Now , I 'll get right to the point . Um , I like ya , both of ya . I can tell instantly about people . It 's a gift . I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica . I 've leased it from the government , and I 've spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve . Really spectacular . Spared no expense . Make the one I 've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo . And there 's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds . And what are those ? Small versions of adults , honey . And not just kids , everyone . We 're going to open next year . That is , if the lawyers don 't kill me first . I don 't care for lawyers . Do you ? Oh , we , uh , don 't know any . I don 't really know any . Well , I do , I 'm afraid . There 's a particular pebble in my shoe , represents my investors . Says that they insist on outside opinions . What kind of opinions ? Well , your kind , not to put too fine a point on it . I mean , let 's face it . In your particular field , you 're the top minds . And if I could just persuade you to sign off on the park , you know , give it your endorsement , maybe even pen a wee testimonial , I could get back on " shedual , " uh , schedule . Why would they care what we think ? What kind of park is this ? It 's right up your alley . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't you come down , just the pair of ya , for the weekend ? I 'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well . I 've got a jet standing by at Choteau . Look , I 'm sorry . This is impossible . Yeah , we - We just dug up a new skeleton . I could compensate you by fully funding your dig . And this is a very unusual time . The timing is - For a further three years . Hmm ? Well , uh , where 's the plane ? Yeah , okay . Cheers . Cheers . Okay . Yo , Dodgson ! You shouldn 't use my name . Dodgson , Dodgson ! We 've got Dodgson here ! See ? Nobody cares . Nice hat . What are you tryin ' to look like , a secret agent ? Well ? Seven fifty . On delivery , 50,000 more for each viable embryo . That 's 1.5 million , if you get all 15 species off the island . Oh , I 'll get ' em all . Remember , viable embryos . They 're no use to us if they don 't survive . Oh ! How am I supposed to transport them ? The bottom screws open . That 's great . Oh , my God . It 's cooled and compartmentalized inside . Oh , that 's great ! Customs can even check it if they want to . Let me see . Oh ! Go on . There 's enough coolant inside for 36 hours . No menthol ? The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then . That 's up to your guy on the boat . 7 : 00 tomorrow night on the east dock . Make sure he gets it right . How are you planning to beat security ? I 've got an 18-minute window . Eighteen minutes , and your company catches up on ten years of research . Gracias , senor . Don 't get cheap on me , Dodgson . That was Hammond 's mistake . So you two , um , dig up dinosaurs ? Well - We try to . You 'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm . He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality , especially for a mathematician . Chaotician , actually . John doesn 't subscribe to chaos , particularly what it has to say about his science project . Codswallop , Ian . You 've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns about the island . Oh , John , John . Because of the behavior of the system in phase space ? A load , if I may say so , of fashionable number crunching . Is not . I do wish you wouldn 't do that . Dr. Sattler , Dr. Grant , you 've heard of chaos theory ? No . No ? Non-linear equations ? Strange attractors ? Dr. Sattler , I refuse to believe that you ... aren 't familiar with the concept of attraction . Hmm ! I bring scientists , you bring a rock star . There it is . Bad wind shears . We have to drop pretty fast , so hold on , 'cause it can be just a little thrilling . Ya-hoo ! No , no , you need that piece over here , and that piece - Look , we 'll have landed by the time you get it right . The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place ? And the concrete moats , and the motion sensor tracking systems . Donald , dear boy , relax . Try and enjoy yourself . Let 's get something straight , John . This is not a weekend excursion . This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . Your investors , whom I represent , are deeply concerned . Forty-eight hours from now , if they 're not convinced , I 'm not convinced . I 'll shut you down , John . In 48 hours , I 'llbe accepting your apologies . All right , slow down . Stop , stop , stop ! This shouldn 't be here . Alan , this species of veriforman 's been extinct ... since the Cretaceous Period . I mean , this thing is humongous . What ? What ? Look at that . Um , it 's - it 's a dinosaur . Uh-huh . You did it . You crazy son of a bitch , you did it . Oh , Ellie , we could just tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness . It doesn 't apply . They 're totally wrong . This is a warm-blooded creature . This thing doesn 't live in a swamp . - This thing 's got what , a 27-foot neck ? - The brachiosaur , 30 . Thirty feet . We 're gonna make a fortune with this place . How fast are they ? Well , we clocked the T-Rex ... at 32 miles an hour . T - T-Rex ? Mm-hmm . You said you 've got a T-Rex ? Uh-huh . Say again . We have a T-Rex . Oh . Put your head between your knees . Dr. Grant , my dear Dr. Sattler , welcome to Jurassic Park . They 're moving in herds . They do move in herds . How 'd you do this ? I 'll show you . G 'day , g 'day , g 'day ! Now , the most advanced amusement park in the entire world , incorporating all the latest technologies . And I 'm not talking just about rides , you know . Everybody has rides . No , we 've made living biological attractions so astounding ... that they 'll capture the imagination of the entire planet . So what are you thinking ? That we 're out of a job . Don 't you mean " extinct " ? Well , now , why don 't you all sit down ? Uh , Donald , sit down , sit down . Ah , here . Here he comes . Well , here I come . Yes . Hello , hello . Say hello . Say hello . Hello . H - Hello . Hello , John . Oh , yes , I 've got lines . Well , fine , fine , I guess . But how did I get here ? Uh , uh , well , let me show you . First I 'll need a drop of blood , your blood . Right . Ooh ! John , that hurt . Relax , John , it 's all part of the miracle of cloning . Hello , John . Hello , John . Hello . Cloned from what ? Loy extraction has never recreated an intact D.N.A. strand . Not without massive sequence gaps . Paleo-D.N.A. from what source ? Where do you get a 100-million-year-old dinosaur blood ? Shhh ! What ? What ? Oh , well , Mr. D.N.A. ! Where did you come from ? From your blood . Just one drop of your blood contains ... billions of strands of D.N.A. , the building blocks of life . A D.N.A. strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing . And sometimes , animals that went extinct millions of years ago , like dinosaurs , left their blueprints behind for us to find . We just had to know where to look . 100 million years ago , there were mosquitoes , just like today . And just like today , they fed on the blood of animals , even dinosaurs . Sometimes , after biting 'a dinosaur , the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree ... and get stuck in the sap . After a long time , the tree sap would get hard ... and become fossilized , just like a dinosaur bone , preserving the mosquito inside . This fossilized tree sap , which we call amber , waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside . Until Jurassic Park scientists came along . Using sophisticated techniques , they extract the preserved blood from the mosquito , and bingo . : dino D.N.A. A full D.N.A. strand contains three billion genetic codes . If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day , it 'd take two years to look at the entire D.N.A. strand . It 's that long . Since it 's so old , it 's full of holes . Now that 's where our geneticists take over . Thinkin 'machine super-computers and gene sequencers ... break down the strand in minutes . And virtual-reality displays show our geneticists the gaps in the D.N.A. sequence . We use the complete D.N.A. of a frog to fill in the holes ... and complete the code . Phew ! And now , we can make a baby dinosaur . This score is only temporary . It all has very dramatic music , of course . Rum-pum-pum ! A march or something . It hasn 't been written yet . And then , of course , the tour moves on . Well , lookie here ! Those hard-workin 'cowpokes you see behind the glass - This is overwhelming , John . Are - Are these characters , uh , auto-erotica ? No , no , no , we have no animatronics here , no . Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park . ... D.N.A. in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs . Wait a minute . How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis ? Can 't we see the unfertilized eggs ? Shortly , shortly , shortly . Now , a whole team of genetic engineers - Can 't - Can 't you stop these things ? I 'm sorry , it 's kind of a ride . One , two , three . Uh - You can 't do that . What ? Can they do that ? A reminder . : The boat for the mainland will be leaving at 1900 hours . All personnel be at the dock no later than 1845 . No exceptions . G 'day , Henry . Oh , good day , sir . Oh . It 's turning the eggs . Oh , God . Oh , perfect timing . I 'd hoped they 'd hatch before I had to go to the boat . Henry , Henry , Henry , why didn 't you tell me ? I insist on being here when they 're born . Come on , come on . Come on , little one . Come on . Come on , little one , come on . Come on , then . Come on , then . Very good . Push , push ! Very good ! Oh , God . Push , come on ! Come on , then . Come on , then . There you are . There you are . There . They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with . That 's it ! Helps them to trust me . I 've been present for the birth ... of every little creature on this island . Well , surely not the ones that have bred in the wilds . Yes . Actually , they can 't breed in the wild . Population control is one of our security precautions . There 's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park . How do you know they can 't breed ? Well , because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female . Oh . We 've engineered them that way . There you are . Oh , my God ! Look at that . Blood temperature seems like about high 80 's maybe . Wu ? Uh , 91 . Homeothermic ? It holds that temperature ? Mm-hmm , yeah . That 's incredible . Ooh . But , um , again , how do you know they 're all female ? What , does somebody go out in the park and pull up the dinosaurs ' skirts ? We control their chromosomes . It 's really not that difficult . All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway . They require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male . We simply deny them that . Deny them that ? John , the kind of control ... you 're attempting is , uh , it 's not possible . If there 's one thing the history of evolution has taught us , it 's that life will not be contained . Life breaks free , it expands to new territories ... and crashes through barriers painfully , maybe even dangerously , but , uh , well , there it is . There it is . You 're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed ? No , I 'm simply saying that life , uh , finds a way . What species is this ? Uh ... it 's a velociraptor . You bred raptors ? Dr. Grant , as I was saying , we laid on lunch for you before you set out into the park . Our gourmet chef , Alejandro - Oh . What are they doing ? Feeding them . Alejandro 's , uh , prepared a delightful menu for us : Chilean sea bass , I believe . Uh , shall we ? They should all be destroyed . Robert . Robert Muldoon , my game warden from Kenya . Bit of an alarmist , I 'm afraid , but knows more about raptors than anyone . What kind of metabolism do they have ? What 's their growth rate ? They 're lethal at eight months , and I do mean lethal . I 've hunted most things that can hunt you , but the way these things move - Fast for a biped ? Cheetah speed . Fifty , sixty miles per hour , if they ever got out in the open . And they 're astonishing jumpers . Yes , yes , yes , yes . That 's why we 're taking extreme precautions . The viewing area set down below here ... Do they show intelligence ? With their brain cavities , we assumed that - They 're extremely intelligent . Even problem-solving intelligence ; especially the big one . We bred eight originally , but she took over the pride ... and killed all but two of the others . That one , when she looks at you , you can see she 's working things out . That 's why we have to feed ' em like this . She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . The fences are electrified , though , right ? That 's right , but they never attack the same place twice . They were testing the fences for weaknesses systematically . They remember . Yes . Well . Who 's hungry ? More adventurous guests ... can opt for ourjungle river cruise or for a close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs - None of these attractions are ready yet , but the park will open with the basic tour you 're about to take . Other rides will come on-line six or twelve months after that . Absolutely spectacular designs . Spared no expense . And we can charge anything we want : 2,000 a day , 10,000 a day . And people will pay it . Then there 's the merchandise . I can personally advise - Donald . Donald . This park was not built to cater only for the super rich . Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals . Sure . They will . What , we 'll have , uh , a coupon day or something . Gee , the lack of humility before nature that 's being displayed here , um ... staggers me . Well , thank you , Dr. Malcolm , but I think things are a little bit different ... than you and I feared . Yeah . They 're a lot worse . Now wait a second . We haven 't even seen the park yet , and you - No , Donald , Donald . Donald , let him talk . I want to hear every viewpoint . I really do . Yeah . Don 't you see the danger , uh , John , inherent in what you 're doing here ? Genetic power 's the most awesome force the planet 's ever seen , but you wield it like a kid that 's found his dad 's gun . - It 's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations - - If I may . Um , I 'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you 're using here . Uh , it didn 't require any discipline to attain it . You know , you read what others had done and you took the next step . You didn 't earn the knowledge for yourselves , so you don 't take any responsibility ... for it . You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could , and before you even knew what you had , you patented it , packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunch box . And now you 're selling it . You wanna sell it . Well - I , I don 't think you 're giving us our due credit . Our scientists have done things which nobody 's ever done before . Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could , they didn 't stop to think if they should . Condors . Condors are on the verge of extinction . No ! If I was to - No , no . If I was to create a flock of condors , you wouldn 't have anything to say . Hold on . This isn 't some species that was obliterated by deforestation ... or the building of a dam . Dinosaurs , uh , uh , had their shot , and nature selected them for extinction . I simply don 't understand this Luddite attitude , especially from a scientist . I mean , how can we stand in the light of discovery and not act ? Oh , what 's so great about discovery ? It 's a violent , penetrative act that scars what it explores . What you call discovery ... I call the rape of the natural world . Well , the question is : How can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem ? And therefore , how could you ever assume that you can control it ? You have plants in this building that are poisonous . You picked them because they look good ; but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they 're in , and they 'll defend themselves , violently , if necessary . Dr. Grant , if there 's one person here ... who could appreciate what I 'm trying to do - The world has just changed so radically , and we 're all running to catch up . I don 't want to jump to any conclusions , but look , dinosaurs and man , two species separated by 65 million years of evolution , have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together . How can we possibly have the slightest idea of what to expect ? I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it . You 're meant to defend me against these characters , and the only one I 've got on my side is the bloodsucking lawyer . Thank you . Well . They 're here . You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park . Spend a little time with our target audience . - Grandpa ! - Kids ! Wait ! Careful with the old man . We miss you . Thanks for the presents . We loved the presents . They were great . Did you enjoy the helicopter ? Yeah ! It went down , and we all went right up . Now , kids , come away . Not too close to the cars . Aren 't they lovely ? Aren 't they glorious ? These will be your transports for the afternoon . No drivers . No , no , no , no . No drivers . They 're electric . They run on this track in the middle of the roadway . Totally non-polluting . Top of the line . Spared no expense . It 's an interactive CD-ROM ! Look ! You just touch the screen and it talks about whatever you want . Lex , darling , you 're all right in there . Dr. Sattler , come with me . Dr. Grant , come in the second car . I 'm gonna ride with , uh , Dr. Sattler . I read your book . Well , that 's ... that 's great . Do you really think that dinosaurs turned into birds and that 's where they all went ? Well , a few species may have evolved along those lines . They sure don 't look like birds to me . I heard that there 's this , um , meteor , hit the earth someplace in Mexico and made this big crater ? Listen , uh - Tim . Tim , which car were you planning on ? Whichever one you are . Then I heard about this thing in Omni ... about this , um , meteor making all this heat . And it made diamond dust . That changed the weather , and they died because of the weather . Then my teacher tells me about this book by a guy named Bakker . He says - She said I should ride with you because it 'd be good for you . The boat is now loading . Everyone must be on the dock for the 1900-hour departure . National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm ... National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm ... about 75 miles west of us . Aye-yi-yi-yi . Why didn 't I build in Orlando ? I 'll keep an eye on it . Maybe it 'll spring south like the last one . Ray , start the tour program . Hold onto your butts . And why did they put the fiberglass thing ? I know . What kind of dinosaurs are we gonna see now ? Hey , lookit ! A ghost , a ghost ! Aah ! Oh , no . It 's driving . Turn in your fear at the door and join the future , right ? Oh , God help us . We 're in the hands of engineers . During most of your tour , the appropriate information ... will be automatically selected and displayed for you . Hey , look ! Simply touch the area of the screen displaying ... the appropriate icon . Are we gonna hit that ? Welcome to Jurassic Park . What have they got in there , King Kong ? The voice you 're now hearing is Richard Kiley . We spared no expense . If you look to the right , you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs on our tour , called Dilophosaurus . - Dilophosaurus ! - Oh , shit ! One of the earliest carnivores , we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous , spitting its venom at its prey , causing blindness and eventually paralysis , allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure . I can 't see . This makes Dilophosaurus ... a beautiful but deadly addition ... to Jurassic Park . Alan ... where ? Damn . Vehicle headlights are on and they 're not responding . Those shouldn 't be running off the car batteries . Item 151 on today 's glitch list . We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo , and the computers aren 't even on their feet yet . Dennis , our lives are in your hands , and you have butterfingers ? I 'm totally unappreciated in my time . You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days . You think that kind of automation is easy ? Or cheap ? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines ... and debug two million lines of code for what I bid for this job ? If you can , I 'd love to see him try . I 'm sorry ... about your financial problems , but they are your problems . Oh , you 're right , you 're absolutely right . Everything 's my problem . I will not get drawn into another financial debate with you , Dennis . I really will not . There 's been hardly any debate at all . I don 't blame people for their mistakes , but I do ask that they pay for them . Thanks , Dad . Dennis ! The headlights . Yeah . I 'll debug the tour program when they get back , okay ? Okay ? It 'll eat a lot of compute cycles . We 'll lose part of the system for a while . There 's a finite amount of memory . You gonna compile for half an hour , for crying out loud ? Quiet ! All of you ! They 're approaching the tyrannosaur paddock . God creates dinosaurs . God destroys dinosaurs . God creates man . Man destroys God . Man creates dinosaurs . Dinosaurs ... eat man . Woman inherits the Earth . We 'll try to tempt the Rex now . Keep watching the fence . What 's gonna happen to the goat ? He 's gonna eat the goat ? Excellent . What 's the matter , kid ? You never had lamb chops ? I happen to be a vegetarian . T - Rex doesn 't want to be fed . He wants to hunt . Can 't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct . Uh , uh , now , eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs ... on your , on your dinosaur tour , right ? Hello ? H-Hello . Yes ? I really hate that man . See , the tyrannosaur , uh , uh , doesn 't obey any set patterns or , or park schedules . The essence , uh , of chaos . Um , I 'm still not clear on chaos . Wh-What does that mean ? Oh , oh , it simply deals with , uh , unpredictability in complex systems . The shorthand is the , the Butterfly Effect . A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking , and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine . I go too fast . I did a fly-by . I missed it . Give me that glass of water . We 're going to conduct an experiment . It should be still . The car 's bouncin ' up and down , but that 's okay . Now , put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic . Say a drop of water falls on your hand . Which way is the drop going to fall off ? Which finger ? Thumb , I 'd say . Aha . Okay . Now freeze your hand . Don 't move . I 'm going to do the same thing , start with the same place again . Which way is it going to roll off ? Let 's say back , the same way . S - Same way . Back the same way . It changed . It changed . Why ? Because tiny variations : uh , the orientation of the hairs on your hands , Hey , Alan , look at this . um , the amount of blood distending your vessels , imperfections in the skin - Imperfections in the skin ? Oh , just ... microscopic . Microscopic . And never repeat and vastly affect the outcome . That 's ... what ? Unpredictability . Right . There . Look at this . See ? I 'm right again . Nobody could 've predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly , suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle . Alan ? Alan ! There 's , uh , another example . See , here I 'm now by myself , uh , er , talking to myself . That 's , that 's chaos theory . Stop the program . Stop the program . I told you how many times ... we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors ? Stopping park vehicles and rebooting program . We 're on . Will notify for resume . I 'll switch it over to TelePromp Ter . What about the circuit integrities ? Screen says faulty sensor . I 'll call security . We 're a full go on that . Looks good . Like I was saying , there 's this other book by a guy named Bakker , - and he says the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases . - Where are we going ? You see something ? Is there anybody else who thinks we shouldn 't be out here ? His book was a lot fatter than yours was . Really ? Yours was fully illustrated , honey . Hey . You okay ? Hey , look at this . Wait . Hey , watch . Hey , come on . Watch this . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Everybody stay here . Timmy ! Hey , Timmy - Oh , wow . Okay ? Of course . Don 't be scared . It 's okay . Muldoon tranquilized her for me . She 's sick . Oh , my God . Hey ! Hey , baby . Hey , baby girl . Yeah . She was my favorite when I was a kid . Now I see her , she 's the most beautiful thing I ever saw . It 's okay . Microvesicles . That 's interesting . Thanks . What are her symptoms ? Oh , imbalance , disorientation , labored breathing . Right . It seems to happen about every six weeks or so . Six weeks . These are dilated . Take a look . They are ? It 's okay . I 'll be damned . That 's pharmacological . From local plant life . Is this West Indian lilac ? Yes . We know they 're toxic , but the animals don 't eat ' em . Are you sure ? Pretty sure . There 's only one way to be positive . I 'd have to see the dinosaur 's droppings . Dino ... droppings , droppings ? Yeah . Yep . Yep . Yeah , I got that . That storm center hasn 't dissipated or changed course . We 're gonna have to cut the tour short , I 'm afraid . Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off . Are you sure we have to ? It 's not worth taking the chance . Well - Sustained winds , 45 knots . Tell them when they get back in the cars . Ladies and gentlemen , last shuttle leaving for the dock ... leaves in approximately five minutes . Drop what you 're doing and leave now . Damn ! That is one big pile of shit . You 're right . There 's no trace of lilac berries . That 's so odd , though . All right , so she 's suffering from Melia toxicity ... every six weeks . Let 's see . Rats . Nada . Every six weeks . She 's , um ... tenacious . You have no idea . You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything ? Doctors , if you please , I have to insist that we get moving . You know , if it 's all right , I 'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the trike . Sure . I 'm in a gas-powered jeep . I can drop her off at the visitor 's center before I make the boat . Then I 'll catch up with you . You sure ? Yeah . I wanna stay with her a little longer . Okay , then . Okay . Now ! There 's nothing I can do . The captain says we gotta go , we gotta go ! You gotta give me the time . I did a test run on this thing . It took me twenty minutes . I could maybe push it to eighteen , but you gotta give me at least fifteen minutes . No promises ! Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage . So much for our first tour . Two no-shows and one sick triceratops . It could 've been worse , John . A lot worse . Anybody want a soda or something ? I 'm going to the machine . I thought , you know , maybe I 'd get somebody something . I 've had only sweets , and I 'm gonna get something salty . I thought maybe somebody would , uh - Oh , I finished debugging the phones . I was gonna debu - So I did . You told me to , uh , so I debugged the phones . I should tell you the system is gonna be compiling ... for , uh , eighteen to twenty minutes . Some of the minor systems might go on or off , but it 's nothing to worry about . It 's a simple thing . You got any kids ? Me ? Oh , oh , hell , yeah , three . I love kids . Hmm . Anything at all can and does happen . Same with wives , for that matter . You married ? Occasionally . Uh , yeah , I 'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs . Malcolm . Five , four , three , two , one . That 's odd . What ? Door security systems are shutting down . Well , Nedry said a few systems would go off-line , didn 't he ? By the way , Dr. Sattler , um , she 's not , like , available , is she ? Why ? Yeah , I 'm sorry . You two are , uh - Yeah . Hey , what 'd I touch ? Uh , you didn 't touch anything . We stopped . Whoa , whoa . What the hell ? What the hell ? What now ? Fences are failing all over the park . Find Nedry ! Check the vending machines . Look at this workstation . What a complete slob . The raptor fences aren 't out , are they ? No , no . They 're still on . Why the hell would he turn the other ones off ? Access main program . Access main security . Access main program grid . Uh , uh , uh ! You didn 't say the magic word . Uh , uh , uh ! Uh , uh , uh ! Please ! Goddamn it ! I hate this hacker crap ! Call Nedry 's people in Cambridge . Uh , uh , uh ! Phones are out too . Uh , uh , uh ! Where did the vehicles stop ? Their radio 's out too . Gennaro said to stay put . Kids okay ? I didn 't ask . Why wouldn 't they be ? Kids get scared . What 's to be scared about ? It 's just a little hiccup in the power . I didn 't say I was scared . I didn 't say you were scared . I know . Boo ! Hey , where did you find those ? Under my seat . Are they heavy ? Yeah ! Then they 're expensive . Put ' em back . Don 't scare me . Oh , cool . Night vision . Do you feel that ? Maybe it 's the power tryin ' to come back on . What is that ? Where 's the goat ? Oh , Jesus ! He left us . He left us . Where does he think he 's going ? When you gotta go , you gotta go . Dr. Grant ? Boy , do I hate being right all the time . Keep absolutely still . Its vision is based on movement . Turn the light off . Turn the light off . Turn the light off ! Turn - Turn it off ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! You 're the one who turned it - No ! Hey ! Oh , God . - Hey-hey ! Hey-hey ! - Ian , freeze ! Get the kids ! Get rid of the flare ! Get the kids ! Get rid of the flare ! Hail Mary , full of grace . The Lord be with me - Aaah ! No ! No ! Aaah - Dr. Grant ! Dr. Grant ! Okay , Lex , I got ya . I 'm stuck ! The seat 's got my feet ! I 'll get you next . You 're okay . Dad ! Dad ! You 're all right . Tim ! Tim ? Don 't move . He can 't see us if we don 't move . This way - Wait , wait , wait ! Timmy ? Timmy ! Tim ! Lex ! Lex ! You 're chokin ' me ! Grab the wire ! " Keycheck space minus O , keychecks off , safety space minus O. " He 's turning the safety systems off . He doesn 't want anybody to see what he 's about to do . Look at this next entry . It 's the kicker . " White rabbit object . " It did it all , but with the keychecks off , the computer didn 't file the keystrokes . The only way to find them is to go through the computer 's lines of code one by one . How many lines of code are there ? About two million . Two million ? Yeah . Robert , I , I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough ... to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren . Sure . I 'm going with him . John . John ? The magic word , the magic word - Uh , uh , uh ! I can 't get Jurassic Park back on-line without Dennis Nedry . Should have been there by now . No damn good . Oh , damn ! There 's the road ! Winch this sucker off the thing and then I tie it to that thing there and then I ... pull down this thing here and I - Oh . Oh ! My glasses ! I can afford more glasses . Oh , geez ! You got time , you got time . You can do it ! You can do it . Come on , Dennis ! Hello ? Ha ! Yeah , yeah , that 's nice . Gotta go . Oh . Ah , nice boy . Nice boy ! Nice dinosaur . I thought you were one of your big brothers . You 're not so bad . What do you want ? You want food ? Look at me . I just fell down a hill . I 'm soakin ' wet . I don 't have any food ! I have no food on me . I have nothing on me . Play fetch ? Play fetch ? Look , see ? See stick ? See stick ? Yeah , look , stick . Look , stick ! Stick , stupid ! Fetch the stick , boy ! You like the stick ? No wonder you 're extinct . I 'm gonna run you over when I come back down . Aaah ! Aaah ! Timmy ? Timmy ! Tim ! Now , Lex , listen , listen to me . I 'm right here . I 'm gonna look after you , but I have to go help your brother . So I want you to stay right here and wait for me ! He left us . He left us ! But that 's not ... what I 'm gonna do . Okay ? Stay here . Timmy ? Tim ? You hear me ? I 'm coming up . I hate climbing . I hate trees . Way too high . Oh , goddamn tree . Hey , Tim ? Tim ? Tim . You okay ? You okay ? I threw up . Oh . Oh , that 's okay . Just give me your hand . Hey , Tim , I won 't tell anyone you threw up . Just , just give me your hand . Here , I gotcha . Come on . Okay . That 's good . Over the wheel . Don 't pull me too hard . No hurry . Stand on the door . Hang onto me . Okay , I got you . Okay . Okay , that 's not too bad , right , Tim ? Yes , it is . Just like coming out of a tree house . Did your dad ever build you a tree house ? No ! Yeah , me too . The thing about climbing is , you never , never look down ! This is impossible . How am I gonna do this ? It 's about 50 , 50 feet - I 'm gonna help you - Oh , no . Tim , go ! Oh ! Go , go , go ! Go , Tim , go ! Faster , Tim ! Tim , jump ! Go , Tim ! Well ... we 're back ... in the car again . Well , at least you 're out of the tree . Where 's the other car ? Where 's the other car ! Alan ! Dr. Grant ! Alan ! Grant ! I think this was Gennaro . I think this was too . I think it 's ahead of us . It could be anywhere . With the fences down , it can wander in and out of any paddock it likes . He put a tourniquet on . Ian . Ian ! Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend . Can we chance moving him ? Please chance it . Ellie , come on ! Wait , wait . The other car ! Dr. Grant ? Alan ! They 're not here . Anybody hear that ? It 's a , um - It 's an impact tremor is what it is . I 'm fairly alarmed here . Come on , come on , come on . We gotta get outta here . Now , now ! Right now ! Go , go , go ! Let 's go ! Start the engine ! Must go faster ! Here it comes ! Fifth gear ! Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! Get off the stick ! Bloody move ! Look out ! Down ! Think they 'll have that on the tour ? Are you hearing this ? Come on , Tim . Come on , hurry up . Let 's , uh , get up this tree . Oh , no . Come on , Tim , it 's okay . Try up here . I don 't want to . Okay . Oh , man . I hate trees . They don 't bother me . Oh , yeah , well , you weren 't in the last one . Hey , those are brontosauruses . I mean , uh , brachiosaurs . They 're singing . Shh , shh ! Don 't let the monsters come over here ! They 're not monsters , Lex . They 're just animals . These are herbivores . That means they only eat vegetables , but for you I think they 'd make an exception . Tim . Oh , I hate the other kind . The other kind just ... do what they do . Ooh ! Aah ! What 's that ? What are you and Ellie gonna do now if you don 't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore ? I don 't know . I guess ... we 'll just have to evolve too . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? I don 't know . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? Do-you-think-he-saurus . What do you call a blind dinosaur 's dog ? You got me . A do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex . Alan ? Yeah ? What if the dinosaurs come back while we 're asleep ? Well , I 'll stay awake . All night ? All night . Hmph . They were all melting . Malcolm 's okay for now . I gave him a shot of morphine . They 'll be fine . Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert ? You know the first ... attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland ... was a flea circus , Petticoat Lane . Really quite wonderful . We had , uh , a wee trapeze and , uh , a merry-go - A carousel . Huh . And a seesaw . They all move motorized , of course , but , uh , people would say they could see the fleas . " Oh , I can see the fleas , Mummy . Can 't you see the fleas ? " Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade . But with this place , I wanted to show them something that wasn 't an illusion . Something that was real . Something that they could ... see and touch . An aim not devoid of merit . But you can 't think through this one , John . You have to feel it . You 're right . You 're absolutely right . Hiring Nedry was a mistake . That 's obvious . We 're overdependent on automation . I can see that now . Now , the next time , everything 's correctable . John . Creation ... is an act of sheer will . Next time , it 'll be flawless . It 's still the flea circus . It 's all an illusion . When we have control again - You 've never had control . That 's the illusion ! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place ! But I made a mistake too . I didn 't have enough respect for that power and it 's out now . The only thing that matters now ... are the people we love . Alan and Lex and Tim . John , they 're out there where people are dying . So - It 's good . Spared no expense . Go away ! It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's a brachiosaur . It 's a veggie-saurus , Lex , veggie-saurus . Veggie . Come on , come on , girl . Come on . Come on . Come on , baby . Yo ! All right ! I 'm not letting go ! Looks like it has a cold . Yeah , maybe . Can I touch it ? Sure . Just think of it as ... kind of a big cow . I like cows . Hey , come on , girl . Come on up here , girl . Come on , up here . God bless you ! Yuck ! Oh , great , now she 'll never try anything new . She 'll just sit in her room and never come out and play on her computer . I 'm a hacker ! That 's what I said . You 're a nerd . I am not a computer nerd . I prefer to be called a hacker . Oh , God . You know what this is ? It 's a dinosaur egg . The dinosaurs ... are breeding . But , my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls . Amphibian DNA . What 's that ? Well , on the tour , the film said they used ... frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps . They mutated the dinosaur genetic code ... and blended it with that of frogs . Now , some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex ... from male to female in a single sex environment . Malcolm was right . Look . Life found a way . No , no , no , that 's crazy . You 're out of your mind . Wait a minute , what exactly would this mean ? We 're talking about a calculated risk , which is about the only option left to us . We will never find the command that Nedry used . He 's covered his tracks far too well . I think it 's obvious now that he 's not coming back . So , shutting down the entire system - You can get somebody else , because I won 't do it . Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything that he did . Now , as I understand it , all the systems will then come back ... on their original start-up mode , correct ? Theoretically , yes . But we 've never shut down the entire system before . It may not come back on at all . Will we get the phones ? Yes , again , in theory . What about the lysine contingency ? We could put that into effect . What 's that ? That is absolutely out of the question . The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals ... in case they ever get off the island . Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism . The animals can 't manufacture the amino acid lysine . Unless they 're completely supplied with lysine by us , they slip into a coma and die . People ... are ... dying . Will you please shut down the system ? Hold onto your butts . Um . It 's okay . Look . See that ? It 's on . It worked . Wait a minute . What do you mean , it worked ? Everything 's still off . Maybe the shutdown tripped the circuit breakers . All we have to do is turn them on , reboot the system : telephones , security doors , half a dozen others , but it worked . System 's ready . Where are the breakers ? Maintenance shed , the other end of the compound . Three minutes , I can have power back on in the entire park . Just to be safe , I want everybody in the emergency bunker ... until Mr. Arnold returns and the whole system is running again . I 'm tired , I 'm hot . I 'm dirty , my legs hurt . Just keep going , guys . The visitors center is just about a mile over that rise . Just ... keep - What is that ? Tim . Tim , can you tell me what they are ? Gr - Ga , uh , uh , gala - Uh , gallimimus . Are , are those , um , meat-eating ? Um , meat-asaurusses ? Look at the wheeling . Uniform direction changes ... just like a flock of birds evading a predator . They 're , uh - They 're flocking this way . I wanna go now . Look how it eats . Please ! I bet you never look at birds the same way again . Yes . Go now . Okay . Keep low and follow me . Look how much blood . Oh , God . Something went wrong . Something 's happened . Something 's wrong . This is just a delay . All major theme parks have delays . When they opened Disneyland in 1956 , nothing worked . John . But , John , if Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down , the pirates don 't eat the tourists . I can 't wait anymore . Something went wrong . I 'm gonna go get the power back on . You can 't just stroll down the road , you know . Don 't let 's be too hasty . He 's only been gone - I 'm going with you . Okay . Sorry . This isn 't going to be just like switching on the kitchen light , but I think I can follow this and then talk you through it . Right . But , uh ... it ought to be me really going . Why ? Well , I 'm a - And you 're , um - - Look . - Come on , let 's go . We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back . You just take me through this step-by-step . I 'm on channel two . Right . Oh , God . Oh , God . The shutdown must have turned off all the fences . Damn it , even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fences . Come on , this way . I can see the shed from here . We can make it if we run . No . We can 't . Why not ? Because we 're being hunted . Oh , God . In the bushes , straight ahead . It 's all right . Like hell it is . Run . Towards the shed . I 've got her . Go ! Now ! Mr. Arnold ? Mr. Arnold ? John , I 'm in . Great . Now , ahead of you is a metal staircase . Go down it . Okay . Going down . After 20 or 30 feet you come to a T-junction . Take a left . Have her follow the main cable . I understand how to read a schematic . I guess that means the power 's off . That 's not funny . That was great . Well , maybe , we could - Damn it . Dead end . Uh , wait a minute , wait a minute . There should have been a right turn back there somewhere . Ellie , look above you . There should be a large bundle of cable and pipes all heading in the same direction . - Follow that . - Okay . Following the piping . Timmy , I bet I could climb over the top ... and be on the other side before you could get to the top . What would you give me ? Respect . Come on , guys , it 's not a race . I see the box . It says " high voltage . " Yeah . Okay . Okay . Good . Here we go . Over the top . Take your time , Tim . That 's good . Come on . Find your footing . Find your footing . Ellie , you can 't throw the main switch by hand . You 've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge . It 's large , flat and gray . All right , here I go . Okay ? One , two , three , four . Okay . Charged . Under the words " contact position " ... there 's a round , green button which says , " push to close . " " Push to close . " Okay . Push it . Ah ! Now , Ellie , the red buttons turn on the individual park systems . Switch ' em on . Timmy ! You 're gonna have to jump ! Get down now ! You crazy ? I 'm not gonna jump . Do what Dr. Grant says ! Let go ! I 'll count to three ! One , two , three ! Control room . Tour . I 'm coming up . I 'm coming up to get you . Lex , I 've gotta get Tim . Okay . I 'm gonna count to three . One , two - Timmy ! Timmy ! He 's not breathing . Mr. Hammond , I think we 're back in business ! Oh , my God ! Goddamn ! Oh , Mr. Arnold . Clever girl . Tim ! No , Tim ! Good boy , good boy . Good boy , good boy , Tim . Three . Hello ? Okay . I 'm gonna have to find the others , get you to a doctor . Lex , you look after Tim . Hey ! Yeah . Your hair is all sticking up . Big Tim , the human piece of toast . I 'll be back soon . I promise . Ellie ! - Run . - Ellie ! It 's just the two raptors , right ? You sure the third one 's contained ? Yes . Unless they figure out how to open doors . Timmy , what is it ? It 's a velociraptor . It 's inside . Follow me . It 's in there . Control room . We can call for help ? We gotta reboot the system first . The door locks ! Ellie , boot up the door locks ! God ! No , boot up the door locks ! Ellie , get back ! Boot up the door locks ! You can 't hold it by yourself ! It 's a UNIX system . I know this . It 's all the files of the whole park . It tells you everything . Um , I gotta find the right file . Try to reach the gun ! I can 't get it unless I move . Oh , this is it ! This might be the right file . Wait . It 's coming . This isn 't the right file . Come on , Lex ! Oh ! You got it ? Yes ! You got it ! Yes ! Yes , this is it ! Yes ! What works ? Phones , security systems ; you name it , we got it . - Grant ? - Mr. Hammond , the phones are working . The children all right ? The children are fine . Call the mainland . Tell ' em to send the damn helicopters . Gonna cut through the glass ! Grant ! Grant ! Move ! Quickly ! Tim , move ! Tim , let go . Yeah . Aaah ! Hold onto me ! Mr. Hammond ! After careful consideration , I 've decided ... not to endorse your park . So have I. Subtitled by renshaw

 [ announcer ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed a strength of steel , the speed of light , and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ child cooing ] [ cooing ] [ snake hisses ] [ continues cooing ] [ Dr. Winger ] This isn 't how it should 've turned out . We can 't let him grow up like that . It would be such a waste . Looks like it might be too late . Maybe . Maybe it 's too late for you and me ... But not for him . - [ electricity surges ] - [ men shout ] [ woman screams ] Just hold still , lady ! We 're gonna get you out of there . - [ sobs ] Help ! - You gotta stay still ! We 'll get you out . Are you all right ? I just stopped to fix my eye and this thing fell on me . I don 't know how to thank you . It 's all ... Do I know you from somewhere ? Serena Smith . Maybe you 've seen some of my films . Oh , maybe , but I usually don 't have time for that . Oh yeah , I guess you wouldn 't . Oh ! Let me give you a reward . No . Thanks . I can 't . Oh ... well ... Here . Take this than . [ crowd gasps ] [ people chattering ] So , the guy in this movie drops himself onto the missile and then goes right into the target . Bam ! Isn 't that something ? Hi Doug . Hi Cindy . OK , give this to Debbie What 's-Her-Name , in personnel . Mr. Jackson , here 's your sandwich . Sorry I 'm late . What are you talkin ' about ? Very funny . OK , who 's the wise guy ? OK , look ... this is what happened . One of these clowns called up and ordered something under my name trying to be funny . Probably tuna fish , they know I hate tuna . It 's pastrami . You told me to get yourself like you always do . I didn 't ask you to do anything . I don 't even know you . Look , here 's something for your trouble . I know this wasn 't your idea . Here . - Mr. Jackson ? - Sorry , I 'm busy , son . - Son ? I 'm Clark . - Glad to meet you . - But I work here . - Sure you do . I do . You know me . Tell him . - Come on . - Let 's get out of here . It 's a joke , isn 't it ? You 're always telling me I 'm too serious . Well , you got me . Wait till I tell Lana . It 'll have to wait , friend . She 's out in the field . No way , you don 't let Lana do field work . Looks like you don 't know so much after all . Lana 's been doing field work for the last two years . - Now , let 's go . - Well ... This is a joke , isn 't it ? As soon as I get to the door everybody 's gonna start laughing ? Well , you 're there now . I don 't hear anybody laughing . Matt , maybe he 's sick or somethin ' . You OK ? I don 't know . - Eddie . - Yes ? - Don 't you know me ? - Am I supposed to ? Are you buying something , or are you just free reading ? She wasn 't killed . Superboy saved her . - Who ? - Superboy . - You know , he flies ... - A boy that flies ? Not in this world . Uh-uh . Excuse me . Ain 't no such thing . Uh-uh . No , no , no . Ain 't no boy who can fly in this world . In what other ? Not in this world ... Hi Eddie , who was that ? Lana , you 're back . How was the investigation ? It was fine . What was he saying about a Superboy ? Sounded like he knew the boy . Said he could fly . And he 's not your type , Lana . Well , you never know . - Dr. Winger ? - Yes ? What can I do for you ? Something happened to me , I think you might be able to help . What 's wrong ? I don 't belong here . I 'm from a different dimension . That 's impossible . A friend of mine traveled through the dimensions before . There are billions of worlds out there . Similar to this one , but different , too . I mean , you know about them . You 've been working on the theory . How ? How do you know that ? There are other Dr. Wingers . I 've met them . You couldn 't have come here . There 's no way . Well , haven 't you built a portal ? A portal ? [ chuckles ] You mean this ? Where 's the real one ? There is no real one . It 's the best I could do with no money . College is practically broke . Well , what about the academic fund ? Superboy helped raise money for it . Super who ? Lana ? I ... think you have me confused with someone else . You 're right . It 's another Lana , I 'm sorry . Wait . Back at the bureau , you were talking about a boy who could fly ? That was nothing . No one 's ever heard of him here . I have . There is rumors about a boy in the jungle who can fly . Is that who you 're talking about ? I 'm not sure . Well , think . Could be really important . If he exists , imagine all the things he could do for the world . All the damage he could cause . I 'm really not sure , but maybe we could ... check it out together ? I get along perfectly well on my own . [ groaning ] He 's really ... real . Yes , he is . And he 's going to be all mine . [ stuttering ] That boy could make us rich , couldn 't he ? Rich ? Ha ! We could own the world . Why is it that you always think so small , Lex ? If it wasn 't for me , you 'd still be writing those stupid equations . [ stutters ] They weren 't stupid . Pi to the millionth place of whatever . Who cares ? Well , it was the ch-challenge . The challenge ? You want a challenge , Lex ? This kid ... this kid is a challenge ! [ groans ] Well , look who 's here . My curiosity got the best of me . I told you , I work alone . Taxi ! Taxi ! It 's the only taxi in town , looks like somebody already hired him . Somebody ? Well , I hope you 're stronger than you look . Oh , I am . [ grunts ] [ groans ] By the way , how did you get here before me ? I flew . I knew he 'd follow her . Everything 's going to work out just right . All right , careful , careful . Careful ! You know , we could use a little help over here , Lex . [ stutters ] In a m-m-minute . No , no , no . Not in a " m-m-minute . " Now . Careful ! Oh , what 's the matter ? Did I break Lexy-wexy 's magic crystal ? There 's nothing m-magical about it . Yeah , well there better be something magical after what you paid for it . Look , the natives say that it can stop the w-w-wild boy . Oh , come on , Lex . Why don 't you just face it . You got beat out of 200 bucks from a guy who walks around with a dish in his mouth . Now , put that stupid thing away and come over and give us a hand ! What is that ? Some kind of UFO ? No ... I don 't know . Clark , one of these crystals have been broken off . - Clark ? - It can 't be . Well , what is it ? Clark ? Have you seen this before ? Not this one . Oh ! Oh ! We did it ! Lex ! We did it ! I did it ! I am rich ! I am so rich ! I 'm a genius . I am a genius . [ breaking ] How 'd he do that ? Lex , don 't . Lex ! I am your father . We 've been searching for you for years . We thought we 'd lost you . This is your mother . [ haltingly ] Father . M-mother . Clark , you still haven 't told me why you acted that way back there . Lana , it 's just that like ... [ boy ] Father ? Mother ? It 's like what , Clark ? There 's something you 're not telling me about that rocket , isn 't there . Lana , could you just wait right here for me ? What , again ? You just went ! Mm . Thank you , son . Thank you . This kid 's a gold mine . [ Superboy ] I wouldn 't count on it , Luther . - There 's two of them . - This one knows you . But how could that be ? You ever met him before ? A g-guy who flies ? I think I 'd remember . Stay away from the boy , Luther . Ah ... Do we know each other ? You don 't know me , but I know you . And I know that whatever you 're planning , it 's not going to work . No ! Please ! Seems he doesn 't like you messing with dear old d-dad . You 're not his father . Don 't listen to him , he 's going to hurt you . - Father ! - No ! Don 't listen to him . He 's bad . No ! Please ! No ! See how strong we are ? We 're the same person . No , no , no ... I don 't want you to get hurt . Well , now you 're making sense . You ... are another story . See , he 's a bad man . Bad . Bad ? Mm-hm . Come on , son . Let 's go . How did you know that thing was going to work on him ? Don 't you listen ? He said they were the same person . Sounds crazy , but the results speak for themselves . Yeah , but don 't you think we should go back there and finish him off ? I don 't think the K-I-D would approve . - Who cares what the K-I-D ... - I care . Now , come on . - Hey , wait just a minute ... - Come on ! Lana ! Oh my God . Are you all right ? We 've been worried about you . Where am I ? Who are you ? Don 't you recognize me ? I 'm Dr. Winger . You 've met different versions of me in the other dimensions . See , in this world , we monitor what goes on in all the other worlds . Sometimes we try to straighten things out . That 's why we sent you into that other world . We 're sorry things turned out so badly . You 're sorry ? We 'll be sending you back to your own world , as soon as we ... we calibrate the portal . There 's a younger version of me ... and Luther 's got him . He 's not being very cooperative . He 's also not breathing .

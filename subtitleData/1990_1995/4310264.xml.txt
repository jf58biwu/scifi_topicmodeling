 [ Woman Narrating ] " Previously on " Earth 2 . [ Yale ] Julia has been taking small doses of Uly 's D.N.A. into her own system . Somehow , she thought it would help her communicate with the Terrians . Maybe we should reevaluate your experiment . You 're jeopardizing our agenda . Morgan Martin is missing . I did something to him ! Where is my husband ? Where is he ? [ Devon Narrating ] For the first time , we travel with one less person in our crew . [ Yale ] It was everyone 's decision . [ Devon ] How 's she gonna survive without us with her , Yale ? She 'll find a way . [ Devon Narrating ] Our 51 st day on this planet is by far the most difficult . We 've traveled more than half the day ... and have uttered less than three words between us . And yet , in our minds , we all tread the same ground repeatedly : " Did we do right ? Did we surpass the bounds ofhumanity by leaving Julia ? ' " It was a very fast vote , one that swept us into its anger . Now , alone with ourselves , we 're left to ponder the weight of that anger . And for some , the weight of their heart . Still , we move forward . Alonzo . It 's a long road ahead . We gotta keep moving . Okay ? I 'm not going anywhere . I know it 's hard , but we 're going to - we 're going to stop in a couple of hours . We shouldn 't have leftJulia . Alonzo , personal feelings aside , she was a spy . Just by being here , she was lying to us . We didn 't have a choice . Well , I have a choice , and I 'm not going on withoutJulia . Let 's talk about it tonight , okay , when we set up camp ? We just left her with a tent , barely any rations . She knows how to analyze indigenous vegetation . She will survive . She 's probably in contact right now with whoever it was she was working for , arranging a way to join them . She will be okay . I 'm sorry . Well , I 'm sorry , too , but I 'm going back for her . I 've decided . Alonzo , you 're part of the group , and the group has made a decision . I don 't care . There is no group anymore . I mean , Julia was part of the group too , right ? And we left her . Now I 'm going back for her , and the rest of you can do whatever you wanna do . - Alonzo . - Save it . [ Beeping ] Danziger . Halt the vehicles . We 're camping here . [ Dune-rail Whirring ] [ Engine Off ] Julia . Julia ? Julia . Where are you ? Julia , where are you ? It 's okay . Any sign of Alonzo ? Not yet . Are you going somewhere ? No use sticking around here wasting a day . Figure I might as well scout ahead , see if I can find a mountain pass for tomorrow . Stay within range . Okay ? Yeah . We can 't just take her back . I mean , the woman attacked me . She experimented on your son , for God 's sake . She - She 's a spy . [ Scoffs ] Walman , am I right ? We did vote to leave her , Devon . Look . I do not disagree , but I will not abandon Alonzo . Why not ? He 's a big boy . He 's capable of making his own decisions . If he wants to follow his sword , that doesn 't mean the rest of us have to . Any news ? How about if she comes back , we tie her to a tether , and we pull her behind the trans-rover for a few days ? That 'll get her talking . Devon . Whatever we do , our first responsibility is to the people ... whose lives depend on the cohesion of this group . Devon , you better get out here . They 're comin ' . [ Engine Off ] She wants you to have this . This is how she was communicating . She wants to prove that it can be behind her . It 's not that simple , Alonzo . Yes , it is . You have my word . It 's not your word I 'm concerned about . Warning . I have a projectile approaching at 200 meters per second . - Projectile ? - Get down . Hit the ground now ! - [ Overlapping Yelling ] - Uly ! Uly ! [ Zero Continues , Indistinct ] [ Projectile Humming ] [ Devon ] Yale . ! Come on . Get away . ! I 've got him ! Yale ! Zero , from what direction ? South by southwest , 27.4 degrees . Julia ! Julia , get over here . He 's hit in the shoulder . Can you help him ? I need my diaglove . All right . Hold him . Hold him . Who shot at us ? Who ? Devon , I don 't know . I swear I don 't know . - He 's losing a lot of blood . - Yeah . Can you hear me , Yale ? Devon , I have to remove the bullet ... and stop any internal bleeding . There 's no one else . I have to . The projectile is a slow bore . [ Beeping ] It 's an auto-propel type . It 's continued to burrow itself some 15 centimeters ... since initial impact into the soft tissue . Can you stop it ? Can you hold this ? I don 't know . If I could just get - I just need to get ahead of it . I think I got it . I got it . Oh , my God , it 's moving . Is Yale gonna die ? No , I 'm - I 'm sure he 'll be fine . Julia 's just finishing up on him now . Is Julia gonna stay with us ? You know what ? Let 's just keep some good thoughts in our heads for Yale right now , okay ? You guys okay ? Yeah , we 're-we 're fine . Good . Now no moving from this spot without Bess 's permission . Both of you , okay ? Yes , Mom . Why is somebody shooting at us ? [ Devon ] I don 't know . Zero is scanning the location right now to get a read . You think they 're convicts ? We don 't know , Uly . Is my dad gonna be okay out there ? True , your father is a very smart man , and we 're doing everything we can to get him on his gear , okay ? All of you , just stay down and do what Bess says , okay ? Okay , Mom . Thanks . We 're gonna be fine . And , True , we 're gonna get in touch with your father , all right ? Is he gonna be okay ? Yeah , he 'll be fine . Well , do you wanna tell me where the bullet came from ? I don 't know . I told you I don 't know where it came from . Julia , don 't you dare think for one minute that what you did in there for Yale ... is gonna wipe your slate clean for us , ' cause it 's not . Devon , how could I have had anything to do with the shooting ? I was in camp with you here . Maybe it 's a penal colonist , I don 't - Or one of your contacts . I never , ever gave up our location . Give me one good reason why I should believe you . Because it 's the truth . No one knows where we are . I promise you . Prove it . [ Reilly ] I 've missed you , citizen . I 've had to be careful lately . Eden Project 's on edge . They 're suspicious of things . They 're having a bit of a problem right now . What kind of problem ? The kind that makes me think you know where we are . [ Sighs ] Let 's just drop the games , Heller . What is it you 're talking about ? Someone 's shooting at us , Reilly . Shooting at you ? Sniper attack . Oh , my God . Was anyone hit ? Yes . I just spent the last 30 minutes chasing a slow-moving worm bullet around a man 's shoulder . Are you sure it was a worm bullet ? Of course I 'm sure . It was still moving in my hand when I pulled it out . Where is the bullet now ? What have you done with it ? - It 's in the med tent . - How long ago was the man hit ? - Approximately an hour . - Get the bullet . Run . Dispose of it as far from your camp as you can now . - Reilly , who was shooting at us ? - I said run , damn it . Go ! Go now ! Did you get that ? Yes . Hurry . Hurry . What is it ? [ Beeping ] Throw it , up there . [ Beeping Faster ] Are you all right ? Yeah . [ Engine Starts ] [ Bess ] Base Camp to Danziger . John ? John ? John , do you read ? Come in . For God 's sake , come in , Danziger . Baines , I can 't raise him . Are you sure he had his gear ? I watched him take it . Why the hell can 't he keep it on ? They call him the Watcher . He works for the Council , determining the viability of this planet for human resettlement . What makes you think he 's not behind this ? He knew about the bullet . I know that the Council does not condone unjustified hostility . So , a bomb on the ship and sabotaging it to crash , that was justified ? Morgan , I 'm not an idiot . I was on the ship . I know there are factions of the Council that no one ever hears about . Just like there are every other aspect of station life . Oh , please , spare us the bad apple analogy , will ya ? I just can 't stand that , " Oh , I 'm-just-the-shiny-red " - and-misunderstood-one ' " part . [ Beeping , Computer Voice ] Respond immediately . [ Julia ] That 's him . I probably should - Watch it , Heller . [ Julia ] I think you should let me respond . It 's the only way we 're gonna find out for sure who 's shooting at us . Just remember I 'm on audio . Me too . I assume you found the bullet in time ? One of my crew members was almost killed . Ah , it 's " your " crew now , is it ? You knew an awful lot about the weaponry that did it . Please , worm bullets are 20-year-old technology . Reilly , you 're gonna be looking for another V.R. partner . All right , all right . There 's no need for that . Your sniper was a ZED . A little genetic engineering mistake . One of those top secret Defense Department projects . Boosted senses , organic armor . And quite a success , till they started killing army brass . They 've dumped them here ? Nothing tames the wild frontier like an unstoppable killer . Reilly , you knew they were here all along , and you 've never warned me ? You wouldn 't tell me where you were . The ZEDs are few and far between . I was hoping you 'd miss each other . [ Sighs ] What does this thing want ? That 's quite simple . They wanna kill , and they 're very good at it . With a group like yours , they first take out anyone with a weapon . Then they work their way down from the largest males ... to the smallest children . Oh , my God . Alonzo ! Julia , no ! Get down . ! Gimme your gun . ! Hey , ZED , take me . Projectile is on approach , 200 meters per second . I 'm right here . Range , 1,900 meters . - " ZED , right here . " - Alonzo , please . Julia ! - Take me . I 've got a gun . - Julia , no . - " Julia , you 're crazy . Get down . " - Julia , get down ! [ Gunshot ] [ Devon ] Oh , God . Alonzo . [ Alonzo Yells ] How you feeling ? You 're nuts , you know that ? What were you thinking out there ? I don 't know . I just - I - I couldn 't lose you . No one 's ever believed in me like you did today . That you came back for me - Hey . Hey . Pretty serious emotions . Sure it 's safe to feel that much ? Feels like the only thing I can be sure of . Hey . I know . I know . [ Monitor Beeping ] So , how are you feeling ? Hmm ? All right . Considering . How is Alonzo ? He 's gonna be okay . Any ideas who 's shooting at us ? Theory . I was hoping maybe you could confirm it . Have you ever heard of a ZED ? A ZED ? That 's what 's shooting at us ? Yes . It stands for Zero Emotional Defects . A secret offshoot of the Yale program . It was halted in the planning stage . You mean they 're human ? They were at one point . Criminals , not unlike myself . The program stripped them of all emotional capabilities . This time , tutors weren 't enough . They wanted super soldiers . Fourteen officers died training 10 or 12 prototypes . Do you know of any way to stop them ? ZEDs are ruthless . They have no emotions whatsoever . They are considered unstoppable . Used in the mining province uprisings ... on Earth in late 2180 . Three ZED units quelled an entire province , killing hundreds of mine workers in days . The incendiary worm bullet became their signature . It seeks a body 's extremities for impact , then works its way to the torso during the interrogation stage . The titanium phosphorus blast incinerates the victim from within , leaving no remains . Ahoy , Eden crew . Anybody down there ? Danziger , is that you ? Where the hell have you been ? Just doing a little recon . What 's with you ? [ Magus ] We 're under attack . I tried to reach you all day , Danziger . You have got to get back here . Hey , what 's going on down there ? Is True all right ? She 's fine , but Alonzo and Yale were shot . There 's some sort of genetic freakoid sniper out here , Danziger . Yeah , I think I just found his shaving kit . Danziger . Danziger , are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . How are Yale and Alonzo ? They 'll be all right . Now listen to me . Leave your vehicle and your weapon behind and get back to camp as fast as you can . What , on foot ? That 's gonna take me twice as long . Do not argue with me , John . This thing can sense machinery of any kind . It 'll track you if you don 't get rid of it . All of it . Just go . Go ! I don 't hear your feet moving . Okay . Okay . Okay . This is nuts . I 'm not leaving the vehicle . Leave it and the weapon . Uh-huh . I didn 't hear it drop . Maybe you 're too busy barking to notice . Danziger , this thing 's already shot two of us from a range of over two kilometers . This is no joke . Shh , shh , shh , shh . - What ? - I don 't know . Nothing maybe . Do not run . It will hear you . Okay . Okay , don 't run . Don 't run . - I told you not to run . - That 's easy for you to say . Is he there ? I 'm not sticking around to find out . - " [ Gunshot ] " - [ Danziger Groaning ] I 'm hit ! Oh , Danziger ! I 'm hit . [ Groans ] Oh . Oh , God , this hurts . Danziger , can you hear me ? Oh , God . Oh , no . Morgan , you watching the time ? Yes . How long since he 's been shot ? About 10 minutes . Can you be more exact ? This could get down to seconds . Um , nine and a half , about . I 'm sorry . That 's the best I can do . That gives us 50 minutes . If he drove the rail , he had to go south . At least it 's a start . - Why ? - The way he dotes on those vehicles ? He would choose the smoothest route possible , and every other direction there 's rocks and ruts . All right , where then ? High ground is where the ZED had to be to hit Yale and Alonzo . [ Beeping ] Well , that narrows it to about three square klicks . We 'd need a day to search that big an area . Does anybody else see something wrong with this picture ? I mean , a bullet that waits an hour to kill somebody ? What is that ? [ Walman ] It 's sick . [ Bess ] Yale said they were sociopathic . - " That 's why they were sent here . " - Well , maybe . But you just don 't build a bullet that drills through the body , and then explodes after an hour unless you have some reason . Can I see the map ? Okay , ifhe 's - The more you move , the faster the bullet moves through you . You should hold still . I will if you will . I can 't . What do you want ? Only this . A sample of your blood . [ Yelling ] I need your name . Why ? To label the sample . [ Gasping ] Who are you ? Do you see it hurts less when you stop moving ? Oh , it still hurts plenty . That 's because the bullet slows , but it doesn 't stop . It will keep traveling to your abdomen and detonate one hour after impact . Unless I make it stop . So make it stop . It 's simple . You obey , otherwise very soon you will die . [ Breathing Heavily ] Okay . Okay . John Danziger . That 's it . That 's all you 're gonna get out of me . Anything else , you make this bullet stop . Got him . I 've got him ! He 's on ! [ ZED ] I have noJohn Danziger . That name is not on the manifest . [ Danziger ] So it 's all a mistake . I can go home . [ ZED ] You 're all alike in this way . The way you defy for no reason . [ Danziger ] Who 's all alike ? Come on . Come on . I 'm not a criminal . So you 're innocent like the others ? - You think I 'm a penal colonist ? - Can you get him ? Yeah , it 's narrowing south-southeast . [ Laughs ] You work for the Council , don 't you ? No more questions . No way the Council would hand out firepower like that to a penal colonist . [ Yelling ] That will be all . [ Groaning ] You will answer all questions put to you . You will do so honestly and concisely . - Questions about what ? - Your time on this planet . He 's studying these penal colonists like guinea pigs . - This thing 's the lab assistant from hell . - " [ Devon ] It 'll be dark soon . " Come on . We gotta locate him . I got him . Why am I sensing a magnetic field behind you ? Oh , no . He 's gone . What ? Warning them won 't help . I will take them all , one by one . And there is nothing any human can do to stop me . How are we gonna do this , Devon ? This thing is a killing machine . Was Danziger right ? Does this thing work for the Council ? I don 't know . I don 't know who works for who anymore . What about Reilly ? Ifhe was hiding the connection , he might be hiding something else . Maybe this thing has some kind of weakness . No , he wouldn 't admit the connection . Even if he did , he wouldn 't tell you how to kill it . I think I have a way . You 're not gonna like this . Heller . He shot the boy , and he 's still got him . - Damn it , that 's impossible . - Well , you tell that to the kid . But you got 42 minutes . You better hurry . The ZED would not shoot the boy , not while a larger target was still available . Well , then I wonder who 's lying here . You told me the ZEDs were sent here like the penal colonists . How did they acquire weapons ? Why are their weapons designed to torture before they kill ? They stole the weapons from my men . Delayed detonator rounds are standard issue to a counterinsurgency force . Let me put it to you this way , Reilly . You 're gonna lose the boy . You tell me how to stop the ZED , or you 're gonna lose your chance to control the planet . You 've got 42 minutes . What 's it gonna be ? [ Sighs ] [ Clears Throat ] The ZED has a small square of non-armored epidermis . It is at the tip of the spine , just where it meets the skull . Any projectile entering there can pass unobstructed to the brain . But you would be a fool to try . The ZED will sense you coming a mile away . That 'll be our problem . And I don 't care what you do with the ZED , the boy is mine . You deliver him , or you will die running . Am I clear ? I 've got three Mag-Pros . I don 't think we should kill him . What the hell was that conversation all about ? We needed to find his soft spot . We don 't have to put a bullet there . Are you nuts ? This thing is a walking warhead . I 've seen plagues less lethal than him . Julia 's right . If we get the drop on him , we can sedate him , and then he can lead us to Reilly . I 'm gonna get my equipment . - You want me to - - No , I will take care of it . Will you just get the A.T.V. Bring it around . I 'll meet you in one minute . [ Clattering ] Devon , don 't give me that stare . You 've had this coming for a long time . The Council could not have tried harder to dissuade you from coming here . I mean - If it was so damned important , why couldn 't they just tell me themselves ? [ Sighs ] No project in space station history has ever needed the secrecy that this one has . If the general population knew that this planet existed , there would be an exodus 10 times the size of the ' 81 skylift . What does all this have to do with my son ? [ Sighs ] The Council is testing five planets for a resettlement . The most promising candidate is this one . But we can 't resettle until they figure out some way to control the planet . You mean control the Terrians ? If they remove the Terrians , the planet starts to die . It 's pretty hopeless until a sick little boy comes along . Something about this boy makes the alien world ... give a piece of itself to make the boy whole . Uly is the key to human acceptance on this planet . The Terrians have chosen him ... for reasons we can 't understand , but we have to respect it . There is a whole world of people at home depending on us . We 're ready . We ? You 're supposed to be resting . You shouldn 't even be talking to me . Danziger 's got 39 minutes , so you can tell me all about it on the way . Okay ? Let 's go . [ Rushing Water ] Simple answers . What is your name ? How did you remove your surveillance tagging ? [ Wings Flapping , Birds Caw ] Describe in detail all contacts with the Terrian population . He 's picked us up . Get Zero moving . No gear on . No machinery of any kind . Okay ? Come on . [ Alonzo ] Go . He 'll focus on Zero . Remember , even the slightest motor activity speeds the bullet along . If it should happen to reach a vital organ before it detonates , there 's nothing I can do to save you . Better hope I make short work of this , John Danziger . Make sure you have contact before you release the sedative . He should go down within seconds . Somehow that sounds like a long time . How much time for Danziger ? Less than 20 minutes left . As soon as it 's clear , we 'll go in for him . I 'm gonna need you to assist me . Zero , are you picking up anything ? I 'm sensing movement 30 degrees west-southwest at 60 meters . He 's at 70 meters . [ Beeps ] Heller , no . No ! State your name . ZED unit , identify yourself . Advance and be killed . I 'm an appointee of the Council , I.D. Delta 04917 . That is a physician 's code . That 's right . I 've been dispatched by Reilly . Do not approach , physician . You have no authority in this field . I have Council authority , soldier . Your orders have been amended . You will prepare this convict for transfer . Transport will be at my discretion only . I will sedate and relocate to my camp . [ Yelling ] Julia , help me get him off me . Let 's get to Danziger . Are you guys okay ? I don 't think I - Oh ! - [ Devon ] I don 't know if I can do this . - " [ Danziger ] Don 't say that . Yes , you can . " Devon , it 's old-fashioned first aid . Use the glove to locate the bullet . [ Beeps ] I found it . Okay . Don 't move . We need the bullet to slow down as much as possible . All right , I 'm gonna set the laser scan function . Okay . Make your incision . [ Bullet Beeping ] - Everybody get away from me . It 's gonna blow ! - I gotcha . - It 's just a warning , okay ? - Devon , make the incision . Laser cut . Avoid the bullet if you can . All right , deeper . Sponge and clot . Third finger command . All right , that 's it . Okay , now go in for it . I don 't feel it . I don 't feel it . Okay , take your time . Take a breath . How 's your pain block ? I don 't feel a thing . Okay . Ooh , ooh , I felt that . All right , all right , it 's wearing off . You have to stay very still . Hold still . I gotcha . Devon ? I can 't find it . I can 't - Wait . Wait a minute . Wait . I got it . I got it . Turn it clockwise . - Clockwise ? - Easy . - I got it . - Hurry . - [ Beeping Faster ] I got it out . Nice teamwork , ladies . I 'm a prisoner ? For debriefing purposes only . Reilly 's issued a change in your op procedure . I 'm sorry about the sedaderm , but your group has a history of assaulting officers . Understood . So he did lose track of me . Yes , he did . You were unaware ? Well , I suspected when my recon data didn 't unload . I 've been at full capacity since I hit 14 enemy dead . All of 'em talked . Better get busy , Doc , if you want my data . I thought that we would , uh , take you back to headquarters . I think Reilly himself would like to talk to you . I 'd just as soon die right here . I don 't wanna take my last breath with the satellite brass . You mean that Reilly 's not even on this planet ? You - Hurry up , Doc . You know my cyanide release was automatic on capture . You 'd better download while you - [ Groans ] Oh , God , I should have known . He has a suicide default mechanism . [ Breathing Heavily ] Who ... are ... you ? [ Julia Sighs ] Don 't keep me in suspense . Is our boy all right ? Yeah , he 's fine . You stopped a ZED ? Yes , with your help . My admiration of you grows daily . I 'm glad you 're on my team . Am I ? Well , I hope so . After all we 've been through , I hope that you can trust me now . Just like the ZED trusted you ? ZEDs aren 't penal colonists , are they ? They 're yours . Ours actually . Ours ? They do the work of the Council ? Phase two ? Find out from the penal colonists what you can about survival on this planet ... and then eliminate them ? Might as well , they 're in a blackout zone . You can 't surveil them . Just like you can 't surveil us from where you 're orbiting , is that right ? But just knowing that you 're in one of the zones narrows down the possibilities . I will find you , citizen . Maybe you will , and maybe you won 't . Heller , this is treason . Funny thing , we figure the stations will say the same about you when we expose you . Somehow I doubt you have that capacity , whoever you are . John Danziger . Alonzo Solace . You want me to spell that for you ? So this is the company you 're keeping now , Heller ? Yes , it is . And we 're glad to have her . You 're making a terrible mistake . I think I 'm finished making terrible mistakes . He 's out there somewhere , orbiting . But he can 't detect us . Not so far . I feel closer to the Terrians all the time . [ Beeping ] Do you wanna do the honors ? [ Sighs ] [ Devon Narrating ] We 'd come to this planet believing humanity deserved a second chance . And we found our first test in offering as much to one of our own . It wasn 't going to be easy , starting over , trusting Julia after all she 'd done . But maybe that 's what separates us from Reilly and his kind . We believe in the value of human life , and we knewJulia deserved a second chance .

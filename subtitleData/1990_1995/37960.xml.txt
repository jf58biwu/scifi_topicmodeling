 Stasis interrupted . Fire in cryogenic compartment . Repeat , fire in cryogenic compartment . All personnel report to ... .. emergency escape vehicle launch pod . Deep-space Flight will commence in T 20 seconds . Oh , Jesus Christ ! - What a way to make a landing ! - Get the torch ! How many ? - Don 't know ! Three , maybe four ! - Hey , Frank ! Can we hurry this up ! It 's gonna be 40 below in five minutes ! Whoa ! Come here ! - I 'll kill him ! - What 's that ? That stupid dog of yours ! Get it out of here ! - Come on , boy . Come on . - Get rid of that dog ! - He 's gone ! A bad way to go , huh ? Hey , Frank , come on , let 's go ! Let 's go ! Wait ! One of them is still alive ! Right . We 'll need all of those . That 's it . OK . You 're all right . This is Rumor Control . Here are the facts . As some of you know , ... .. a 337 model EEV ... .. crash-landed here at 0600 on the morning watch . There was one survivor , ... .. two dead , and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair . The survivor is a woman . Is she pretty ? I just want to say that I 've taken a vow of celibacy ... .. that also includes women . We 've all taken the vow ! Shut your gob , Morse ! I don 't appreciate company policy ... .. allowing her to intermingle with the inmates and the staff ! Our brother means to say we view the presence of any outsider , ... .. especially a woman , ... .. as a violation of the harmony , and potential break in the spiritual unity . We are aware of your feelings in this matter . You will be pleased to know that I have requested ... .. a rescue team . Hopefully they will come this week ... .. and evacuate her ASAP . Don 't give us that ! - What 's her medical status ? - She doesn 't seem too badly damaged . She 's unconscious . Can 't give a more specific diagnosis . - Will she live ? - I would think so . Look ! It 's in everybody 's interest she doesn 't leave the infirmary ... .. until the rescue team arrives . Certainly not without an escort , right ? Sir . Gentlemen ! We should all stick to our set routine , and not get unduly agitated ! Correct ? All right . Thank you , gentlemen . All right . Better get here soon . What 's that ? Just a little cocktail of my own mix . A sort of eye-opener . You a doctor ? My name is Clemens . I 'm the Chief Medical Officer here . - Here ? - Fury 161 . It 's one of Weyland-Yutani 's backwater work prisons , ... .. it grieves me to say . Do you mind ? This is a stabiliser . I really ought to shave your head . We have a big problem with lice here . When you feel better I 'll give you some clippers for your private parts . How did I get here ? You ... crash-landed in an EEV . Evidently separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere . Any idea how long you 've been in hyper sleep ? Coming out that way can jolt your system . - I 'll be sick for a couple of weeks . - Indeed . Where are the others ? They didn 't make it . What ? They didn 't survive . I have to get to the ship . I have to get to the ship . - You 're in no condition for that . - You wanna get me some clothes , or ... .. should I go like this ? Given the nature of our indigenous population , I would suggest clothes . None of them has seen a woman in years . Neither have I , for that matter . This used to be a 5,000-convict facility . But it 's been reduced to a custodial ... staff of 25 . - Why ? - To keep the pilot light on . Pilot light for what ? Blast furnace ! Natural methane ! We have a foundry , It . Ripley ! The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containment ! How do you know my name ? It 's stenciled on the back of your shorts . Release the cable ! Where are the bodies ? We have a morgue . We 've put them there until the investigative team arrives . In about a week , I think . - There was a droid . - Disconnected . He was in bits and pieces . We put what was left on the rubbish tip . The corporal was impaled ... .. by that safety support . Never knew what hit him . And the girl ? She ... drowned in her cryo-tube . I don 't think she was conscious ... .. when it happened . I 'm sorry . What 's the matter ? - Where is she ? - In the morgue . I have to see her . I have to see what 's left of her . Oh , God , there you are ! I 've been looking everywhere for you ! Where you been , huh ? Come here ! You OK ? Let me see , Spike . Let me see . Are you OK ? Let me see . What have you been sticking your face into ? Hey ! Did somebody do this to you ? What kind of animal would do this to a dog ? Um , ... .. could I have a moment alone , please ? Yes , of course . Forgive me . What 's she doing ? OK ? No . We have to do an autopsy . - What ? - I told you . We have to make sure how she died . And I told you ... she drowned . I 'm not so sure . I ... I have to see inside of her . You 're disorientated . I have a very , very good reason . Perhaps you 'd like to share that reason ? Possible contagion . What kind , exactly ? - Cholera . - Cholera ? There hasn 't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years . Please ? Everything 's in place . There 's no sign of infection . No indication of disease . Her chest . Open her chest . Careful . Lungs ... .. flooded with fluid . Ergo , she drowned . Now , ... .. since I 'm not a complete idiot , ... .. would you tell me what we 're really looking for ? Mr Clemens ! Superintendent ! I don 't believe you 've met Lieutenant Ripley . - What 's going on , Mr Clemens ? - That 's right , sir . What 's going on ? First , ... .. the lieutenant is feeling much better , I 'm happy to say . Second , in the interest of public health , ... - .. I am performing an autopsy . - Without my authority . There didn 't seem to be time . But it 's turned out all right . - There 's no sign of contagion . - Good . It might help if Ripley didn 't parade around in front of the prisoners . As I am told she did in the last hour . It might also be helpful ... .. if you informed me of any change in her physical status . - Or is that asking too much ? - We have to cremate the bodies . Nonsense ! We 'll keep the bodies on ice ... - .. till the rescue team arrives . - On ice . There is the public-health issue . The lieutenant feels there is still the possibility of a communicable infection ... I thought you said there was no sign of disease ? It would appear the child drowned . But without proper laboratory tests it 's impossible to be certain . I would consider it unwise to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus . An outbreak of ... cholera ... .. would look extremely bad on a report , would it not , sir ? We 've 25 prisoners in this facility , ... .. all double Y chromos , ... .. all thieves , rapists , murderers , child molesters . All scum . Just because they 've taken on religion doesn 't make them any less dangerous . I try not to offend their convictions . I don 't want to upset the order . I don 't want ripples in the water . And I don 't want a woman walking around , giving them ideas . I see . For my own personal safety . Exactly . I will leave the details of the cremation to you , Mr Clemens . They may use the furnace , but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours . We commit this child and this man to Your keeping , O Lord . Their bodies have been taken from the shadow of our nights . They have been released ... .. from all darkness and pain . The child and the man ... .. have gone beyond our world . They are forever ... .. eternal ... .. and everlasting . Ashes to ashes , ... .. dust to dust . Why ? Why are the innocent punished ? Why the sacrifice ? Why the pain ? There aren 't any promises . Nothing 's certain . Only that some get called , some get saved . She won 't ever know the hardship and grief ... .. for those of us left behind . We commit these bodies to the void ... .. with a glad heart . For within each seed ... .. there is a promise of a flower . And within each death , ... .. no matter how small , ... .. there 's always a new life . A new ... beginning . Amen . Amen . I tell ya , it 's fuckin ' weird . The only one that survived that crash is a woman . They 'd already changed everything . I know she 's serious ... What the fuck are we supposed to do ? I mean it ! Not from round here , that 's for sure . Hello ... I just wanted to , uh , say thanks for what you said at the funeral . It was ... My friends would 've appreciated ... Yeah , well , you don 't wanna know me , lady . I 'm a murderer and rapist of women . Really ? Well , I guess ... I must make you nervous . Do you have any faith , sister ? Not much . Well , we 've got a lot of faith here . - Enough even for you . - I thought women weren 't allowed . We 've never had any before . But we tolerate anybody . Even the intolerable . Thank you . That 's just a statement of principle . Nothing personal . You see , ... .. we 've got a good place to wait here . And until now ... .. no temptation . Dillon and the rest of the ... .. alternative people ... .. embraced religion , as it were , about five years ago . - Take two ? - I 'm on medication . - Hardly . - What kind of religion ? Some sort of ... apocalyptic , millenarian , Christian fundamentalist ... - Right . - Exactly . When the company wanted to close the facility down , ... .. Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay . And ... they were allowed to remain as custodians , ... .. with two minders ... .. and a medical officer . And here we are . How did you get this wonderful assignment ? How do you like your new haircut ? It 's OK . Now that I 've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews , ... .. damaged my already less-than-perfect relationship with that good man , ... .. and briefed you on the humdrum history of Fury 161 , ... .. can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl ? Are you attracted to me ? In what way ? In that way . You 're very direct . I 've been out here a long time . In the year 7510 Hey , Spike ! Spike ! Spikey ! Are you down there ? What are you doing ? I really appreciate your affections . But I am aware that they ... deflected my question . In the nicest possible way . You 're spoiling the mood . I have a job to do . I just want to know why we had to cremate them . I had a terrible dream in hyper sleep . And I had to be sure what killed her . Anyway , I made a mistake . Possibly . And now I 've made another mistake . - Really ? What 's that ? - Fraternising with a prisoner . Physical contact . It 's against the rules , isn 't it ? I 'm not a prisoner . You have a bar code on the back of your head . That does deserve an explanation . But I don 't think now is the moment . Mr Clemens . Mr Aaron . Superintendent Andrews would like you to report to ventshaft22 . Now . - We 've had an accident . - Something serious ? You could call it that . One of our prisoners has been ... diced . Sorry . I have to go . Official duties . - Who was it ? - Murphy . How do you know ? That 's his boot . I gave him the assignment , sir . He was a wanker . No apologies , Mr Aaron , it wasn 't your fault . Well , not much to say , is there ? Death was instantaneous . No shit . I take it he was pulled into the fan . Rush of air , I 'd imagine . Except ... Right ! Almost happened to me once . I 've told ' em so many times : stay away from the fans . Nobody bloody listens . Except the fan was blowing . What 's that ? - I don 't know . - I want to see you in my quarters ... .. in 30 minutes , if you please , Mr Clemens . Have you got any ideas ? You know , wandering around without an escort ... .. will really piss Superintendent Andrews off . - Tell me about your accident . - One of the prisoners has been killed . Really ? How ? In the air shaft . Poor sod backed into a 9-foot fan . I found something at the accident site . Just ... a bit away from where it happened . A mark . A burn . Like the one you found on the girl 's cryo-tube . Look , ... .. I 'm on your side . I want to help , but I need to know what 's going on . Or what you think is going on . If you really wanna help , find me a computer with audio capabilities ... .. to access this flight recorder . We don 't have anything like that here . What about Bishop ? - Bishop ? - The droid that crashed with me . I can point you in the right direction . I can 't join you . I have a previous engagement . Listen to me , you piece of shit ! Screw with me once more , I 'll cut you in half . I 'm sorry , I don 't think I understand . At 0700 hours I received word from the network . This is the first high-level communication ... .. this installation has ever received , to my knowledge . They want this woman looked after . - They consider her to be high priority . - Why ? I have no idea . Why did you let her out of the infirmary ? ! This accident with Murphy is what happens ... .. when one of these sons of bitches gets a hard-on . I 'm a doctor , you 're the jailer . We both know exactly what you are . Sit down ! I think it might be better if I left . I find you unpleasant to be around . Isn 't that lovely ! Consider this , Mr Clemens . How would you like me to explain your sordid history to your new friend ? For her personal edification , of course . Now sit the hell down . Now , ... .. is there anything I should know ? - Ohhh ! - Shut up , you fuckin ' bitch ! Shut up , you bitch ! Let go of me ! Fuck you ! No ! - Hold still ! - Ssh ! Ssh ! No ! You OK ? Son of a bitch ! Take off . I gotta re-educate some of the brothers . We gotta discuss some matters of the spirit . This is like ten city blocks . How many ? This makes 176 . Can 't you chew quieter ? I 'm trying to figure out how big this compartment is . - I can 't think with this goddamn noise ... - You 're not supposed to swear . I 'm sorry . We 've encircled this entire compartment ... Hey ! What ? - What the shit is doing that ? - Swearing ! Shut up ! It 's all right to say " shit " . It ain 't against God . What 's going on with the candles ? Must be the wind from one of the vent shafts . Backwash from the closest circulating unit . But if all the candles go out , how are we gonna know where we are ? Somebody will just have to go back and relight them . I guess I 'm nominated . Watch your step , brother . OK , who are the comedians ? Agh ! Agh ! No ! Go ! Quick , in here ! Help me , help me ! Go ! Fuckin ' go ! Go on ! Go on ! Quick ! Come on ! Give me that ! Get this fuckin ' thing off me ! Oh , God , no ! Let me go ! Hey ! - Hello , Ripley . - Hello , Bishop . - How are you feeling ? - My legs hurt . - Listen , I 'm sorry . - That 's OK . I 'm just a glorified toaster . How are you ? I like your new haircut . Can you access data on the flight recorder ? No problem . I 'm home . What happened on the Sulaco ? Why were our cryo-tubes ejected ? Stasis interrupted . Fire in cryogenic compartment . Repeat , fire in cryogenic ... What happened ? What started the fire , Bishop ? Can you hear me ? The fire was electrical . It was ... in the sub-flooring . Did the sensors pick up anything moving around prior to separation ? It 's very dark here , Ripley . I 'm not what I used to be . Just tell me . Does the recorder indicate anything ? Was there an alien on board ? Yes . Is it on the Sulaco , or did it come with us in the EEV ? It was with us all the way . Does the company know ? The company knows everything that happened on the ship . It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network . And they want it ? I hurt . Do me a favour . Disconnect me . I could be reworked . But I 'll never be top-of-the-line again . I 'd rather be nothing . You sure ? Do it for me , Ripley . It wasn 't me ! I didn 't do it ! So help me ! It was the dragon . Feeds on minds . It was ... Nobody can stop it . - What about Boggs and Rains ? - Slaughtered like pigs . It wasn 't me ! It wasn 't me ! Stark raving mad . It wasn 't anyone 's fault , but he should have been chained up . You called it , sir . Mad as a fuckin ' hatter . Keep him separated . Don 't want him causing a panic . Clemens ! - Yeah . - Sedate this poor idiot . Not until we know about the brothers . Now , pull yourself together . Talk to me now . - Now , where are Boggs and Rains ? - It wasn 't me . You won 't get anything out of him ! We 'll have to send out a search team . There 's a good chance this simple bastard has murdered them ! And you don 't know that . He 's never lied to me . He 's crazy , ... .. he 's a fool , but he 's not a liar ! He 's telling the truth . I 'd like to talk to him about this ... this dragon . It 's a dragon ! You won 't talk to anyone . I 'm not interested in your opinion . You are not in full possession of the facts . He is a convicted murderer , known for particularly brutal crimes . - Isn 't that right , Mr Dillon ? - Yeah . That part 's right . Then I 'll talk to you . It 's important . When I 've finished with my official duties , I 'll be pleased to have a little chat . Yes ? Let me see if I have this correct , Lieutenant . It 's an eight-foot creature , with acid for blood , ... .. and it arrived on your spaceship . It kills on sight and is ... generally unpleasant . And you expect me to accept all this on your word . No . I don 't expect anything . Quite a story , Mr Aaron . Right , sir . It 's a beauty . Never heard anything quite like it , sir . Expect not . Tell me , Lieutenant , what would you suggest we do ? Well , what kind of weapons have you got ? This is a prison . It 's not a good idea to allow prisoners access to firearms . It keeps them from killing you . There 's no way to escape . With the arrival of the next supply ship , ... .. the company will eliminate it . This is a maximum security prison ... .. and you have no weapons of any kind ? We have some carving knives in the abattoir , ... .. a few more in the mess hall , some fire axes . Nothing terribly formidable . That 's all ? We 're on the honour system . Then we 're fucked . No ! You 're fucked . Confined to the infirmary . Quarantined . Mr Aaron will escort you . You 'll be safe from any large , nasty beasts while you 're there . Right ? Yes . That 's a good girl . Let 's all report to the mess hall . The superintendent wants a meeting . Mess hall , right away , people . Isn 't there any way off of this place ? Some way to escape ? No . - A supply ship comes every six months . - That 's it ? That 's it . Fuck ! They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon . Really ? What 's soon ? I don 't know . Nobody 's ever been in a hurry to get here before . Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about ? No . You 'd just say I 'm crazy . That 's a bit uncharitable . How are you feeling ? Not so hot . Sore throat , ... .. sick to my stomach . Pissed off . Understandable , given the circumstances . Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails . I don 't know why everybody blames everybody for everything . Nobody 's perfect . We 're only human . I don 't know a perfect human . Nobody I know . You married ? Me ? You should get married , have kids . Pretty girl . I used to know lots of them . Back home . They used to like me . For a while . You 're gonna die , too . Are you ? What ? Married . Why ? Just curious . No . How about levelling with me ? When I asked how you got assigned here , you avoided the question . Then when I asked about the prison ID ... .. tattooed on the back of your head , you ducked me again . It 's a long , sad story . And more than a little melodramatic . Try me . If you insist . After my student years , ... .. despite the fact that I had become ... secretly addicted ... .. to morphine , I was considered to be most promising . A man with a future . During my first residency I did a 36-hour stretch on an ER . So I went out and I got more than a little drunk . Then I got called back . A boiler had blown in a fuel plant and there were ... 30 casualties . And 11 of them died . Not as a result of the accident , ... .. but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller . And I got seven years in prison and my licence reduced to a three-C . At least I got off the morphine . I 'm sorry . I think I was let off lightly . Did you serve your time here ? I got to know this motley crew quite well . So when they stayed , ... .. l stayed . Nobody else would employ me . So ... do you still trust me with a needle ? Once again this is Rumour Control . Here are the facts . At 0800 hours , prisoner Murphy , ... .. through carelessness on his part , was found dead in vent shaft 17 . He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan . At about 2100 hours , ... .. prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state . Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing . There seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play ... .. at the hands of prisoner Golic . We need to organise and send out a search party . Volunteers will be appreciated . I think it 's fair to say that our smoothly-running facility ... .. has suddenly developed a few problems . I can only hope we are able to all pull together over the next few days , ... .. until the rescue team arrives for It . Ripley . - It 's here ! It got Clemens ! - Stop this raving at once ! I 'm telling you ! It 's here ! Aaron , get that foolish woman back to the infirmary ! Move it ! Everybody ! Fuck ! What do we do now ? Who 's in charge ? Organise ! We gotta organise , right ? Right ! I 'm next in line . 85 's gonna be in charge . Jesus ! Give us a break ! Don 't call me that ! Look , there 's no way I can replace Andrews . He was a good man . I know you didn 't appreciate him ... Aaron , we don 't wanna hear that shit now . Hey , sister , what about you ? You 're an officer . How about showing us a little leadership ? Forget fuckin ' Shirley Temple ! You take charge . Right ! - You run things here anyway . - No fuckin ' way . I 'm not the officer type . I just take care of my own . Well , what does this fuckin ' beast want ? Is this mother gonna try for us all ? Yeah . Ain 't that sweet ! How are we gonna stop it ? - You have no weapons . Is that correct ? - Right . I haven 't seen one exactly like this before . It moves differently . But the others were afraid of fire . Not much else . Can we seal off this area ? No chance . The installation 's ten miles square . There 's 600 air ducts round ... What about video ? We could find it using these closed-circuit monitors . The video system hasn 't worked in years . Nothing much works here ! We 've got technology , no way to fix it . - 85 is trying to tell you ... - Don 't call me that ! .. we ain 't got no entertainment centre . No climate control , no video system . No surveillance . No freezers . No fuckin ' ice cream . No rubbers , no women . No guns . All we got here is shit ! What the hell are we even talking to her for ? She brought the fucker . Why don 't we just get her head and shove it through that fuckin ' wall ? ! Morse ... Why don 't you shut the fuck up ? Right . Right . What are we going to do ? What 's this ? It leads from the mess hall ... to the infirmary . It 's a ventilation shaft . Then we go in there . Flush it out . Hey , look , there 's miles and miles of tunnel through there . It won 't go far . It 'll nest in this area . Right around ... .. here . How do you know that ? It 's like a lion . - It sticks close to the zebras . - Zebras ? Oh , right . But running around here in the dark , are you kidding ? Outside of this main shaft there 's no overheads . - Don 't we have flashlights ? - Thousands of them , but no batteries . Torches ? Do we have the capacity to make fire ? Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age . No need to be sarcastic . Never been used . They were gonna dump nuclear crap in there . Never got round to it . It 's clean as a whistle inside . This is the only way ... in or out ? That 's right . Walls are six feet thick . Solid steel . They knew how to build these babies . You 're saying , we get something in there , ... - .. there 's no way it can get out ? - That 's right . No fucking way . It 's kept here . Forget what this stuff 's called . - Quinitricetyline . - I knew that . I 've gotta get these section arrangements uh ... organised with Dillon ... .. for the ... paint brush , uh ... So , um ... - David ... - Yeah . - You can get these drums organised . - Right , 85 . And , uh ... .. don 't call me that . What 's this ... 85 thing ? A couple of us sneaked a look at his personnel file . It 's his IQ . I saw a drum of this stuff fall into a beachhead bunker once . The blast put a tug in dry dock for 17 weeks . Great stuff ! All right , let me get this straight . You wanna burn it down and out of the pipes , ... .. force it in here , slam the door , and trap its ass ? Right . You want help from us Y-chromo boys , huh ? You got something better to do ? Why should we put our ass on the line for you ? Your ass is already on the line . The only question is ... .. what are you gonna do about it ? Man , this stuff stinks ! You miss Doc , right ? What makes you say that ? I thought you two got real close . I guess you 've been looking through some keyholes . - That 's what I thought . - Ohh ! Ohh ... I hate this place . I hate this place ! There 's definitely something in here with us . Don 't light the fire until I give the signal . This is the signal . Got it ? Can you remember that ? Agh ! Shit ! No ! No ! No ! Wait for the fucking signal ! Get down ! Come on ! We gotta find the sprinklers ! We gotta help these guys ! Get to the waste dump . Don 't open the door ! Dillon ! Over here ! Here 's another one . Oh , Jesus . This makes ten . Fuckin ' great ! Well , now what are we gonna do ? You OK ? Piss on her . The fuckin ' thing 's loose . What are we gonna do ? I just said that . You miserable little shit ! Cut that shit out . Tell your fuckin ' bozo to shape up . What do you think ? I 've got to get to the EEV . Why ? What 's up ? I just have to use the neuro-scanner . You don 't look so good . Who gives a shit ! What are we gonna do ? Do you want a smack in the mouth , you stupid wanker ? Stop causing panic ! Panic ? You 're so stupid , you couldn 't spell it . Don 't talk to me about panic ! Shut up , both of you ! Shut up ! - Well , I 'm out of ideas ! - Doesn 't surprise me . - What about outside ? - Oh , great idea ! The sun doesn 't come up for two days , it 's 40 below zero . That makes a lot of sense ! You want us to stay here and let this thing have us for lunch . Get everybody that 's still left together . Come down to the furnace . OK . Need any help ? I didn 't mean to scare you . You shouldn 't be wandering around alone . Do me a favour and ... run this keyboard , will you ? OK . - What do I do ? - Hit B or C. What 's C ? - " Display bio-functions " ? - That 's it . OK , we 're hot . Now what ? Let it run its cycle . It 's real fuzzy . Hit enhancement . Keep looking . I don 't know how to read this stuff . Haemorrhaging will show as a dark patch . Look for ... hairline fractures through the ... base of the skull . Little white lines . What is it ? I think you 've got one inside of you . That 's not possible ! What does it look like ? Horrible . I have to see it . Freeze it ! - You don 't want to look at it . - Freeze it ! I 'm sorry . It 's up . What do you want to say ? Tell them the whole place has gone toxic . Are you kidding ? They won 't come here . The rescue team will turn back . Yeah , I know . What are you talking about ? Our only hope is that they kill this fucker . Maybe they can do something for you . I don 't know , freeze you ! An operation ! They 've got the technology ! If this organism gets off the planet , it 'll kill everything . The company doesn 't care about that . They just want it , for their bio-weapons division , OK ? So we can 't let them come here . Fuck you ! Look , I 'm sorry you 've got this thing inside you , but I 'm getting rescued . I don 't care about these prisoners . But I 've got a wife and kid . I 'm going home ! I know . This is hard . But I 'm gonna send this message . I need that fucking code . I 'm sorry , ma 'am . It 's classified . You stupid little shit , this has got to be done ! There are no alternatives ! You 're not getting it ! No fucking way ! Look ... it 's nothing personal . Understand ? I think you 're OK . Thanks . - Have you got any ideas ? - I don 't know . Maybe I 'll go find it . See how smart it is . You 're gonna go and look for it ? Yeah . I have a pretty good idea where it is . It 's just down there . In the basement . This whole place is a basement . It 's a metaphor . Do you wanna come ? Fuck me ! Where are you when I need you ? Don 't be afraid . I 'm part of the family . You 've been in my life so long ... .. l can 't remember anything else . Now do something for me . It 's easy . Just ... Just do what you do . Oh ! It won 't kill me . You 're supposed to be laying low . I have one inside of me . - What are you talking about ? - I saw it . On the CAT scan . It 's a queen . An egg-layer . It can make thousands more . It still sounds like bullshit to me . If it 's inside you , how did it get there ? When I was in hyper sleep , I guess . I don 't have much time . And I can 't do what I should . I need you to help me . I need you to kill me . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm dead anyway . I can 't survive it . But the one inside of me can generate thousands more . It has to die . So somebody 's gotta kill me . Are you up to it ? You don 't have to worry about that . So ... No speeches . No prayers . What 's going on ? I don 't like losing a fight . Not to nobody , not to nothing . That thing has already killed half my men and got the other half scared shitless . As long as it 's alive , sister , you 're not gonna save any universe . - You fuckin ' coward ! - I want that thing ! I wanna get this thing and I need you to do it . And if it won 't kill you , then maybe that helps us fight it . Otherwise fuck you ! Dillon ! We waste this thing . - Then you take care of me . - No problem . Quick , easy and painless . You die sitting here on your ass , or you die out there . At least we take a shot . We owe it one ! What the fuck are you talking about ? I 'm talking about killing that big motherfucker . That doesn 't mean we should fight it . Jesus Christ , give us a break ! You guys have got to be fucking nuts . I 've got a wife and kid ... Nobody gives a shit about you , 85 . You 're not a believer . You 're a fuckin ' company man ! Yeah , OK . I 'm a company man , not a fuckin ' criminal . You tell me how dumb I am . I 'm smart enough not to have a life sentence ! Piss off ! Weirdo ! And I 'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up ... .. before we fight this thing ! Right ? OK , just sit here , on your asses . Fine ! How about if I sit here on my ass ? No problem . Oh , I forgot ! You 're the guy that 's made a deal with God to live for ever , huh ? And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out , too . Me and her 'll do all the fighting . OK . But I want the same thing as you . I want to see it dead . I hate the fucker ! It killed my mates , too ! Why the fuck can 't we wait for the company ... .. and have some guns on our side ? Why go on a fucking suicide run ? Right ! Because they won 't kill it . They might kill you for having seen it but they won 't kill it . That is crazy ! That is horseshit ! They will not kill us ! When they first heard about this thing , it was " crew expendable " . The next time , they sent in Marines . They were expendable , too . What makes you think they 're gonna care about a bunch of lifers , who found God ... .. at the ass-end of space ? You really think they 're gonna let you interfere with their plans ? They think we 're ... we 're crud . And they don 't give a fuck ... .. about one friend of yours that 's ... that 's died . Not one . Have you got some sort of plan ? This is a lead works , isn 't it ? All we gotta do is lower the fuckin ' beast into the mould . Drown it in hot lead . Oh , right . So how do we do that ? Yeah . What are we gonna use for bait ? Oh , fuck ! You 're all gonna die . The only question is how you check out . Do you want it on your feet ... or on your fuckin ' knees ? Begging ! I ain 't much for begging ! Nobody ever gave me nothing ! So I say fuck that thing ! Let 's fight it ! Fuck it ! Let 's go , boys ! OK . What the fuck are we gonna do if it runs at us ? Better have some fucking good ideas . Door 1 open . When was the last time you used this place ? We fired it up five , six years ago . You sure the piston 's gonna work ? There 's nothing for sure in this place . We trap it here first , then you pull the lever . The piston 's gonna push it into the mould . One of the guys will pour the lead . - End of his ass , end of story . - What if somebody screws it up ? We 're fucked . You got one chance , one shot at it . There 'll be no time to reset it . Now , remember , ... .. you pull the lever . For a few seconds you 're gonna be trapped in here with that thing . You guys don 't drop the ball , I won 't . You better be right about that thing not wanting you . Because if it wants out , that 's how it 's gonna go . Through that alcove , through you . - Where are you gonna be ? - I 'll be around . What about the others ? Praying . - I have a problem with this . - What part ? Where we 're running in the dark fuckin ' maze with that thing chasing us . You lead it down channel B to the piston chamber . I 'll close the doors behind you . Hey ! What if it won 't cooperate ? What if we get lost ? This was her idea . I don 't know about this shit . Hey , guys ! My door ain 't working ! What the fuck is he saying ? I think we better rethink this thing ! Did anybody hear anything ? Come on ! Come and get me , you fucker ! It 's behind me ! It 's started . It 's still behind me ! It 's in channel B ! It 's behind me ! Shut the doors ! Must be heading over to channel A ! This thing is really pissed off ! - Did you say B ? - No , E ! - But you said we should stay here ! - Move your ass ! Morse ? Kevin ! Yoo-hoo ! Hey , fuckface ! Come and get me ! You can 't get me ! A-7 closed ! Over in the east wing ! Door B-7 safe ! - You , too ? - Yeah ! Over to E , everybody ! - Where the fuck is E ? ! - This way ! Here ! Here , kitty , kitty , kitty ! Here , kitty , kitty ... You bastard ! It 's coming ! It 's coming down through this tunnel ! It 's after us ! Shut the fucking doors ! Jesus ! I can fucking see it ! Dillon , anybody ! This is not a drill ! Kevin ! Gregor ! Where the fuck are you ? ! Kevin ! Now I 'm back in A ! Door three , F channel closed ! I hope . - What the fuck are you doing ? - What ? Don 't hold it like that . Like this ! You could kill someone , you fuckin ' moron ! Morse ! Kevin ! Gregor ! All they have to do is run down the damn corridor . Stay here . Where the hell is it ? It 's coming ! Oh , Jesus ! There ! No ! Don 't start the piston ! No ! We have to trap it ! What are you doing ? It 's gone ! No ! No . It 's gone ! OK ? OK . Oh ! Kevin ! No ! Don 't move ! No . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! - The doors . - It 's coming ! Take the piston ! - Ah ! Oh ! - It 's all right . It 's OK . It 's all right , Kevin . Kevin . Kevin ! Leave him ! Leave him ! He 's dead . Lure it in . Shit ! How much time ? I 'm not sure . Four or five minutes . But we got to get it back in here ... .. before the piston seals this place off ! Now let 's move it ! Oh ! Help me ! Jude ! Dillon ! Help me ! It 's coming at me ! Don 't look back , Jude ! Run as fast as you fuckin ' can ! You gotta help me ! Please ! Oh ! Jesus Christ ! Thank God you 're here ! Warder Aaron , sir . 137512 . Not many of us left , sir . Where is It . Ripley ? Is she still alive ? If she 's alive , she 's in the furnace . She 's in the lead works with the beast . Wouldn 't wait . Jesus Christ ! You fucker . Scared me shitless ! I thought you were the fuckin ' beast ! You fucker ! Wanker ! Move ! Come on , you bastard ! Come on ! Get out of there ! Come here ! Ripley , we 're running out of time ! Ripley , where are you ? No ! Dillon , over here ! Dillon ! Come on ! Get out of there ! - What the fuck is wrong with you ? ! - No ! Let it go ! Yes , it 's working ! To the piston ! - Come on ! - We gotta get it in front of the piston ! - It 's following us ! - Come on ! Come on and get us ! - Come on ! - Up to the door ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on , motherfucker ! Come on ! Get the door ! Get the door ! Morse ! - Now ! - Shut it ! Shut it , Morse ! Morse ! Shut the door ! - Now ! - Shut the fuckin ' door ! I 'm going for the lead ! - Now ! - What about you ? - I 'm staying . - Bullshit ! - There 'll be ten tons of hot lead in here . - I wanna die ! We got a deal ! It dies first , then you ! I 'm not gonna move without you ! Now get going ! Dillon ? I 'm gonna hold it here . - What about me ? - God will take care of you , sister ! No ! Pour the lead . I 'll fuck you ! - No ! - Go on , Ripley ! Go on ! Agh ! Damn it ! Pour the lead , Ripley ! Pour it now ! Come on ! Is that all you got ? Fight , motherfucker ! - Come on , do it ! - Morse ! Over here ! Ripley ! Pour the lead ! Pour the lead ! Pour it ! I hate bugs ! Ripley ! It 's burning hot ! Hit the sprinkler ! Douse the fucker ! Gotcha ! Yes ! Don 't come any closer . Wait ! They 're here to help . Stay where you are ! - Ripley . - Bishop ! - I 'm here to help you . - No more bullshit . I just felt it move . - You know who I am ? - You 're a droid . Same model as Bishop . Sent by the fucking company . No . I 'm not the Bishop android . I designed it . I 'm very human . The company sent me here to show you a friendly face . To demonstrate how important you are to us . To me . - You wanna take it back . - We want to kill it and take you home . Bullshit . You 're wrong . We want to help . What does that mean ? We 're going to take that out of you . Keep it . We can 't allow it to live . Everything we know would be in jeopardy . - You don 't want to take it back ? - Ripley , time is important . We 've got a surgical bay set up on the rescue ship . Come with me . You still can have a life . Children . And most important ... .. you 'll know it 's dead . Let me help you . What guarantee do I have ... .. once you 've taken it out ... .. that you 'll destroy it ? You have to trust me . Please . Trust me . No . What 's this gonna achieve ? Stop ! Oh , Jesus ! Morse ... Will you help me ? What do you want me to do ? It was a mistake . There was no need for any of it . Fuckin ' android ! Ripley ! Think of all we could learn from it . It 's the chance of a lifetime ! You must let me have it ! It 's a magnificent specimen . What are you doing ? No ! Ah ! - Come on , you . Get going ! - Oh , fuck you ! Captain Dallas is dead . Cargo and ship destroyed . I should reach the frontier in about six weeks . With a bit of luck , the network will pick me up . This is Ripley . Last survivor of the Nostromo . Signing off .

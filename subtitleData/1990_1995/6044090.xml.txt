 [ ♪ music ♪ ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on earth found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent ... he learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind He is Superboy . [ children shouting ] So help me , if you two don 't cut it out , I 'm gonna come back there and ... Burt . This is a vacation . Vacations are fun . I am sorry , honey . Sometimes Daddy has a bad day . [ car horn honking ] [ screaming ] [ squeals ] Superboy . I thought we were going to .. . How can I ever thank you ? Got any cash ? No cash , huh ? Well , nice car . Engine 's good . Consider the debt paid in full . [ Superboy laughs ] Does Superboy have bad days too , Dad ? [ man ] Lana . [ screams ] Don 't scream . Don 't scream . I just want your help . I 'm not Luthor . I 'm Superboy . You 're out of your mind . No it 's my body I 'm out of . Just give me two minutes , then you can walk away . Lana , you 've gotta trust me . Trust ? That 's ironic coming from you . I need you to listen to me . But I 'm not gonna force you . Two minutes , then I scream . Fair enough . There was this experiment . I wanted to find out where I came from . A doctor , Dr. Deland . He used to work with Professor Peterson . He said that he could help me . We were in his lab . Every memory makes a molecular imprint , If I can scan them with electron beams , we might be able to get all the way down to your earliest memories . Maybe find out where you came from . ... and why I 'm here . Ready ? Now , close your eyes , and start counting backwards . From a hundred . 100 ... 99 ... 98 ... 97 ... . 96 ... [ breathing ] Dr. Deland ? [ laughter ] You are indeed a genius . I 'm not in this for an ego massage . We agreed to a sum of money . Not until I get your notes on and the plans for this thing . How can I be sure I 'll get my money . Take my word for it . Getting money 's never gonna be a problem for me again . [ laughter ] Perhaps it 's time our chrome-dome friend finally made his date with the electric chair . They tricked me using my past as bait . And I swallowed the hook . Are you done ? Is this the part where you let me just walk away ? Lana , all I need you to do is go and see if Deland is still there . I can 't go myself . If the police catch me ... You 'll get what you deserve . No , you 've got to believe ... [ man ] Hey . What are you doing ? He 's hurting me . No . No problem , sir . Are you all right , ma 'am ? Yeah . That 's Lex Luthor . He 's wanted ... You sure you 're OK ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Did Luthor have a gun or anything ? Unh uh . Did he try to take you away with him ? No . Doesn 't sound like Luthor . I know , but ... Who else could it have been ? I 'm gonna go tell Jackson about this . You sure you 're OK ? Had to have been him . Lana . You seen Clark . I got some print outs for him . I 'll take ' em . Sent me a note . He 's not feeling very well . Whoa . Who 's that ? It 's nobody . Pretty impressive credentials for a nobody . PHD in physics and bio-engineering . Tenured position at Shuster . " ... was forced to resign for unstated reasons . Does this have something to do with Luthor ? I don 't , I don 't think so . Good . Leave Luthor to Superboy . Lex , Lex ... Lex come on this isn 't funny . Put me down . What 's my name ? All right . It 's Superboy . Superboy . I like the sound of that . So , what are you gonna do now ? I mean take over the world or something . [ shrieks ] Maybe . I don 't want anyone to start believing Luthor when he says he 's in the wrong body . So why don 't you just get rid of him ? Just like that ? Not a chance . I want him to feel what it 's like to be me . Humiliated , persecuted . Despised . Then I 'm gonna see to it that he gets exactly what 's coming to me . [ laughter ] Oh Lex . I mean why wait for that ? Do it now . You know ? Business before pleasure . You may have a point there . So um , you 're gonna do it now ? I just said I was . And Superboy never lies . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to frighten you . That 's all right . I 've been hoping to see you . Me too . I saw Lex , this morning . Luthor . Did he hurt you , or ... No , no . He didn 't hurt me . He only wanted to talk to me . Talk to you . About what ? Nothing . Lana , whatever he says , you shouldn 't listen to him . You have to trust me . Will you do that ? Trust . Like always . Because there 's something more important I want to talk to you about . Our relationship . I 've been thinking , maybe it 's time that we should deepen it . Bring it to another level of meaning . Um ... What 's wrong ? I 'm just not used to you acting this way . We all have our week moments . Here 's where I 'm staying . For when you have one of your weak moments . It 's important that you trust me , Lana . You 're the one who 's always known me best . Trust me ? [ wheezing ] Freeze . [ gunshots fired ] [ glass shattering ] Doesn 't this guy ever exercise . Hello , Luthor . [ laughter ] I 'm not , Luthor . You know this is all a terrible mistake . Yeah , you 're the one who made it when you took on Superboy . Why doesn 't somebody talk to Dr. Deland . He can tell them ... Deland is dead . Died on the way to the hospital . What are you doing ? Letting you out so they can take you to the State Prison . What for ? 'Cause that 's where the electric chair is . This is all a mistake . Lex , get in . Lana . Get in . You shouldn 't be doing this . Are you crazy ? I 'm helping you . But you 're breaking the law . [ Lana ] Now I know you 're Superboy . What made you finally believe me ? I knew you 'd never come on to me like that . Like what ? Here it is . I think he put ' em in here . Here 's his notes . And the blueprints for the machine . We can rebuild it . What 's wrong ? Think about it . About what ? About everything we have to do . Going up against somebody with my with his powers . Listen to me . You think the only thing that makes you a hero is your powers ? You said so yourself . When you could have run and maybe escaped , you stayed and tried to help Deland . That 's what being a hero really means . It 's not what you are , it 's who you are . - Lana , there 's no way ... - Yes , there is . You 're in Luthor 's body . All you have to do is stop thinking like him . Convicted killer Lex Luthor escaped from jail late today while being transferred from a maximum security prison where he faced execution . Police say that they are following up leads , but admit to having no real evidence as to his whereabouts . Lex . [ laughing ] It 's better than remote control . So , what now ? What do you mean , what now ? It 's even better this way . Let him taste freedom one more time . That way when he 's in the chair , it 'll hurt even more . [ knocking ] Be a good little girl and go wait in the other room . Why ? Who is it ? It 's business . Lana . What a surprise . I decided you were right . It is time to take our relationship to a deeper level . I 'm glad . Won 't you come in ? Hello , Luthor . Oh , I get it . A trap . And how you gonna take me in ? Cuffs ? That doesn 't matter . You killed Dr. Deland for no reason . No reason ? I 'm insulted . I 'm truly insulted . Deland was the only one who knew about our little switcheroo . And he was the only one who could switch us back . And so you killed him . Of course I killed him . But I had a reason . And now you 'll pay . And what pray tell could that be , but the dreaded Kryptonite ? You got it . Ah ! You have to wake up pretty early in the morning to beat Superboy . Get him . I 'm trying to think of which one of my super powers to use . That 's it . It 's his favorite . This is great . [ screams ] You mustn 't do this . With his demented mind and my powers he 'll turn the world into a he 's got to be stopped . Frankly , I don 't see the problem . I mean it 's pretty obvious who 's who here , Luthor . He 's Luthor . Sure he is . Do you want to do the honors ? Sir ? Pull the switch . I , I , I couldn 't . It 's only fitting . The governor will be here any minute . He could still change his mind . You 'd be doing the world a service . Well , if you put it that way . You have to listen to this . Deland was the only one who knew about our only switcheroo . And so you killed him . Of course I killed him . [ door slams ] Let 's do it . Did it work ? No . No . No . No , no , no , no ! [ screaming ] No ! We did it . All you 've proven is that brains are better than brawn . Which means I can beat you . You better hurry . Once that chair is rewired , you 're gonna be it 's first guest . You 'd better watch your back my friend . I 'm not dead yet .

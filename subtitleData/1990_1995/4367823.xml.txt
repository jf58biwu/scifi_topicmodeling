 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California ' s Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . Helen ? How are we doing with that uplink to Osaka ? It 's coming up now , thank you . - l didn 't realize there 'd be so many of you . - That 's not Osaka . - What the hell is this ? - lt 's one of those videophone sex lines . You place an order for what you want to see , and they perform it for you . We must 've crossed lines with another call . Helen ? God , I hope they 're not getting this in Osaka . [ Seductive instrumental music playing on screen ] I got your fantasy phone order . executive 1 : It 's not bad , so far . I will do everything I can ... to make you feel good . I hope you 're enjoying this as much as I am . virginia : Please , please no ! [ Gunfire ] executive 2 : Oh , my God . Perverts . WOMAN : [ On TV ] Every day at this time , I want to treat Max to something special . When he 's worked up an appetite , I give him New Menu . George , hurry up . GEORGE : I 'm coming . Wouldn 't wanna miss the freak show . Buck , this is something to be proud of . It 's not every day your father becomes a star . - Like Spuds MacKenzie . - Morning . WOMAN : [ On TV ] lt 's so good . Good morning , this is Renee Longstreet . Here it is . Tonight and every night this week we 'll present part of our continuing ... Alien Anniversary series , featuring George Francisco ... LAPD 's first Newcomer detective , one year later . We 'll investigate the investigator at home and on the job , starting tonight . They may as well put you in a cage at the zoo for a week . Buck , your father has an opportunity to break down some stereotypes . This is a good way for people to see who we really are and how we live . You 'll be wonderful . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's just another day at the office . [ Speaking in alien language ] Sikes , new shirt . New jacket . No wonder you made captain . You 're very observant , Bry . You can 't fool me , Sikes . You can dress it up , but you can 't take it out . So I 'm only going to say this once . This is good behavior week . I don 't want you doing anything to ... embarrass the department while that camera 's around . I will be an angel , angel . Look , just finish the interviews with the ... witnesses on that Vegas junket bus mugging . Okay , everybody , this is it . Best behavior . - What would you like me to do ? - Just do what you normally do . CAMERAMAN : We 're rolling . - Good morning , Matthew . - Morning , George . Where are we on the Vegas bus muggings ? We still have several dozen witnesses to interview , Captain . Let 's be thorough , but efficient . I 'm sorry , I was searching for the right word and hesitated . - Could we do that over ? - Kill it . Ms. Longstreet ? Hi , I 'm Matt Sikes , George 's partner . Look , don 't be too hard on the Captain . He hasn 't had a lot of experience with this sort of thing . - Thank you , Detective . - Don 't mention it . Look , Captain . This isn 't a movie . So just carry on like we 're not even here . Ignore us , be yourself . Now , Francisco and Sikes are on the bus mugging , huh ? Okay . We 've got some shots we can get around the building while they 're doing that . - So , we 'll just- - - No . No need for that . We just got a call in about a videophone sex homicide . I 'd like to send Francisco and Sikes on that . How would that be ? That would be very interesting . MATT : I know why you 're nervous . If you blow it on TV , you blow it for Newcomers everywhere . - Yes . Exactly . - Listen . It 's just another day in the pits . You 're a good cop . I am there to back you up . Routine . Let 's go . Excuse me , Det . Sikes . I know we didn 't get much of a chance to talk ... but I want you to know that your cooperation ... and involvement is very important . And , by the way , you are very natural on camera . - Thanks . - Keep it up . Now this seems dumb , I know , but ... would you mind if Det . Francisco went in first ? - Sure . He 's the star . - Thanks . Reports of shots fired came at the same time executives witnessed ... the videophone murder . This scene matches the description given by the executives . And I warn you now that it may not be very pretty in there . They said it was bizarre , but a set ? Start on the bed so we don 't know what we 're looking at . Then pan up the wall , up , pull back , we see it 's a set . Got it . What kind of sick mind would do something like this ? It 's beyond me . Matt . - Maybe there weren 't any victims . - You thinking what I 'm thinking ? There was no murder. lt 's a hoax . - A hoax ? - Yeah . Stage blood . There 's no bullet holes . It 's all make-believe . Ma 'am , you can 't go in there . - Ma 'am , you can 't- - - l 'm telling you , this is my place . You two got names ? The name 's Virginia Hamm . This is Roger Rose . Look , we can explain all of ... . Didn 't I see you on TV this morning ? It 's Francisco , right ? Yes , they 're doing a segment for the news . What the hell 's going on here ? I 'm sorry about the gunshots , but I 'm afraid it 's all a big mistake . You see , we 're still a very young industry and ... we 're working all the kinks out . - " Voyeur Vision " ? - Pay-per-view videophone sex line . - Phone sex ? - Yeah . - Do you use that ? - No ! Try it , you 'll like it . We 're taking phone sex to a whole new level . And it 's legal . Our permits . The gunshots you heard and all of this ... was part of a fantasy sequence requested by a viewer . What , some sicko wants to see a Newcomer girl ... dance dirty and then get blown away ? It takes all kinds . Some executives saw your fantasy by mistake and thought it was a murder . - You should have seen their faces . - You can see them ? It 's interactive . When the conference room freaked out ... we realized the phone company screwed up and got ... their teleconference crossed up with our voyeur . So if you want to arrest somebody , cuff the phone company . Gunshots echo through the night , summoning police to where ... blood-spattered walls tell a macabre tale of agony and death . Who is responsible for such a heinous crime ? It 's beyond me . That response is not surprising from an average detective . All the signs say cults or crazed killer . But not to LA ' s first Newcomer Detective ... who uses his superior instincts and senses ... to cut through police obstacles mere mortals need computers for . It only took him seconds to realize ... . There was no murder . This is a hoax . RENEE : Not a murder at all , but a staged show ... a bizarre bispecial videophone voyeurism . And Det . Francisco saw right through it . Dad , maybe I was wrong . That was pretty clever . You see , that 's not exactly what happened . Matthew- - l am so proud of you . Everyone at school is going to want to talk to me tomorrow . - Emily , you see- - - You know , George ... - you look a little washed out . - Washed out ? Maybe a darker suit and a brighter tie would be more flattering ... - accent your spots . - My spots ? - You 're selling yourself . - Susan , I 'm not selling anything . Sure you are . You know , my work at the ad agency ... has taught me a lot about presenting the best possible image ... in the shortest amount of time . We 're selling the Newcomer ideal . So are you . Look how I 've designed this ad . See , a dark suit and a bright tie convey competence and warmth ... like Ronald Reagan used to do . Historians are crediting that to his hair . Why don 't you let me try tomorrow ? RENEE : [ On TV ] Please join us tomorrow night ... when we continue our five-part series ... [ Knocking on door ] on LA ' s first Newcomer detective ... Sgt. George Francisco . - Did you see George 's feature ? - l saw it . It really made George look good . Made me look like a part of the K-9 Corps , the one on the leash . REPORTER : For the next 60 seconds ... there will be a test of the Emergency Broadcast System . I guess George is the focus of the thing , but ... . [ High-pitched humming on TV ] [ Cathy moaning ] Cathy ? You okay ? What ? It 's only a test . I don 't know how your FCC got that particular tone , but it 's ... extremely arousing . What ? That tone , F sharp above high C ... it 's very sexually stimulating . I didn 't know that about you people . There 's a lot about us you don 't know . [ Man laughing ] [ Man laughing ] [ Virginia moaning ] I hope this is making up for this morning 's mix-up . Before this fantasy is over ... it will be worth twice what you paid . [ Virginia screams ] Get out of here ! virginia : Call the police ! This is real ! - He asked for my autograph . - Glad you could make it . Renee surprised us early , wanted to catch me eating an alien breakfast . A plate of French toads ? - Did you see the show last night ? - No , I had errands to run . - Why the new threads ? - Rather natty , aren 't they ? Susan felt the darkness of the jacket ... contrasting with the brightness of the tie ... would leave an impression of strength with accessibility . Maybe I should try a sweater vest . Okay , boys . You 're on . So , what happened here ? Last night around midnight , Virginia Hamm and Roger Rose ... were putting on a show for some sicko voyeur . No sooner had they yelled , " Lights , camera , action " ... some nut with a Louisville slugger comes in ... and starts bouncing it off of Roger 's head . He 's in intensive now , they 're having trouble waking him up . And Virginia Hamm ? She bolted , either out of fear or out of guilt . We did manage to trace the owner of Voyeur Vision . Name 's Arvin Kaufman . Kaufman has been exploiting Newcomers since the day our ship landed . From his cheap tours of Little Tencton to his Newcomer flesh magazines . Matt . This human preoccupation with nude women , nude people ... or sometimes many nude people performing ... I just don 't understand it . He 's going to call his lawyer if we don 't leave ? Lady , I 'll be calling his undertaker if he doesn 't let us in . Excuse me . May I ? Knock yourself out . Hello ? This is Renee Longstreet , KALN news . May I speak with Mr. Kaufman , please ? Yes , Mr. Kaufman. I 'm doing an exclusive on the first Newcomer detective . You 've seen it . Thank you . Thank you , we 'll be right in . [ Seductive instrumental music playing ] Let 's get an establishing shot of the room . Then pan over to me here ... and I 'll really give them an idea who Arvin Kaufman is . Wonder what they 're like ? I wondered , too , when I first saw them . Then I wondered if everyone else wondered . Five years ago , I was a mope going nowhere , then they came . - Pennies from heaven , huh ? - Krugerrands . Now you must be curious , Detective . It 's only natural to be . Now I 'm sure my girls would let you give them a physical . Sorry , not interested . Why don 't you go let them listen to a test pattern ? So you do know something about them ? Playing a little doctor on the side , Detective ? CAMERAMAN : Right behind you , Detective . Ms. Longstreet , Detective , welcome . I 've been watching your reports . We 're investigating an assault on one of your Voyeur Vision employees ... named Roger Rose . At Voyeur Vision , we 're all one big family . When one of us hurts , we all hurt . He was last seen with a Newcomer female named Virginia Hamm . - Have you seen her ? - No , I haven 't. I 'm very worried . She mentioned she had a client scheduled for last night . We need to know who it was , they might have seen something . I know she had a client last night . At Voyeur Vision we do everything we can to fulfill our customers ' fantasies . Also , we 're very protective of our customers ' confidentiality . So I am afraid I can 't give that information out . That 's all I 'm willing to say on camera . RENEE : Kill it . Yeah , sure , after you get yourself a free commercial . Now wait a second , Detective . I 'm willing to pay . After all , one hand washes the other . What happened to customer confidentiality ? Now if I 'd given you my client 's credit card number on camera ... that would 've been bad for business . But if this number helps you solve the crime , that 's good for business . And we both want what 's good for business , don 't we , Detective ? - And what is your business , Kaufman ? - Fulfilling fantasies , satisfying curiosities . And , Detective , I am personally going to work on fulfilling yours . Just got a make on Virginia 's voyeur . A guy named Ernie Denton . - He may have seen something , let 's roll . - Matt , I can 't. I am sorry . After watching last night 's segment , the mayor has invited me to lunch . - Just you ? - l asked , but you know . What about the case ? Well , I 'm sorry , Matt , but the mayor , she is very important . Why don 't you speak with Denton and meet up with me later ? Give me ! Louis , will you and your cousin stop teasing Tilly ? MRS. DENTON : Don 't take her doll anymore , Louis . Leave her alone , I mean it . - Ernie Denton ? - No , he 's my brother-in-law . Who 's asking ? Mom , some guy is looking for Dad . It 's a private matter . He 's getting the cooler . - Ernie ! Someone 's looking for you . - Yeah . Ernie Denton . My name 's Sikes. I 'd like to ask you a few questions about Voyeur Vision . Yeah . Yeah , I called Voyeur Vision a few times . You like that rough stuff , huh ? It 's just fantasy . Besides , I haven 't called in a long time . Look , I don 't want my family to find out about this , okay ? They think I 'm talking about parking tickets in here . Your credit card record shows you 've ... called this service a lot in the last few weeks . - l lost my wallet . - When ? A couple of weeks ago . You didn 't cancel your cards ? You see , I thought my wife canceled them . Look , I 'm not accusing you of anything ... but it 's kind of coincidental that whoever took your wallet also called Voyeur Vision . The number for Voyeur Vision was in my wallet . I was curious , but I 'm not anymore . - ls everything okay ? - Everything 's fine , John . The burgers are ready , Dad . Go on. I wouldn 't want to keep you from your family . MATT : No , Det . Francisco is not here . Yes , ma 'am . I 'm glad you 're enjoying the profiles . You 're right . He 's one of the hardest working cops in town ... especially when he 's here . That 's nice . Oh , yes . Profile ... . l heard you wanted me . Someone gets a base hit off of old Roger 's noggin ... and Virginia 's the one who runs ? We were performing for a client . Suddenly this guy in a mask , I didn 't get a look at his face . He was just all over Roger . I was panicked , I ran . - The jerk got my purse . - Where 've you been ? I had a lot of thinking to do . I finally called Arvin , and he said I should come in . Why do you let that sleaze bucket exploit you ? Exploit ? I 'm a businesswoman. I 've made $ 100,000 in the last six months ... which I 've invested in Japanese-backed U.S. bailout bonds . At this rate , I 'll be SFL in two years . - " SFL " ? - Set for life . That 's why I 'm here . I think the guy in the mask ... is tied to the voyeur who ordered the fantasy . - Why ? - The voyeur 's a real weirdo . Always asks for something that starts out nice , turns violent . I call him The Giggler . He sits back in the shadows . When things turn dark in the fantasy , he starts to giggle . Sounds like a regular Boy Scout . Yeah , well , a video john 's a video john . I 've dealt with his type , but before last night , it was never dangerous . Should 've seen it coming . He always asks for violence . Last night 's request was for something soft and romantic . Guess he got tired of make-believe . Last night he supplied the violence . He started to giggle before the guy in the mask came out . Like he knew what was coming . Listen , here 's my card . If he calls back , would you be willing to set him up ? Yeah , the sooner the better . Time 's money . - Where 's the camera crew ? - They 're setting up for a briefing . So how 's Her Honor ? The mayor 's fine and she has such a beautiful home . You should see it . Romanesque columns and a lovely fin de siecle porte-gouttiere . Yeah , I 'll try to fit her into my social calendar . From your viewers , George . - These are fan calls . - Don 't let it swell your head . - ls my head swelling ? - lt 's just an expression . What 've you got ? The Abdul-Jabbar Standing Tall Citizenship Award. lt 's quite an honor . Yeah , well , I hate to rain on your cupcakes ... but while you were standing tall ... I was busting butt on our case . - You do remember our case ? - Yes , of course . I 'm sorry , Matthew . It 's this news thing , it 's just sort of taken over . Francisco , where 've you been ? I 've been looking for you . I 've been rubbing elbows with the brass and ... they 've got a few ideas they want you to promote for the cameras . Let 's go . [ Praying in alien language ] Susan , this meal looks especially delicious this evening . The lymph nodes were fresh . So , Dad , you got an award from the mayor today . Yes , she 's very nice , very sincere . Maybe she 'd like to come to my birthday party next week . Kill it . Were we going too fast ? We could slow down . No , everything is fine , but you mentioned Emily 's birthday . I just had a terrific idea . You see , our research shows that our ... viewers are most interested in your home life , your rituals . - What day is your birthday , Em ? - A week from Thursday . - Too bad we can 't use it . - Why not ? Emily 's birthday is next week , but we finish with your series on Friday ... and I don 't really think she 'd like to celebrate it tomorrow ? Of course not . Would you , Em ? Think about it , your birthday on TV . CATHY : Matt . This was delivered for you today , and they needed a signature , so I took it . Yeah , thanks. I 'll see you . I couldn 't help but notice the Kaufman logo . Isn 't he the man who produces the adult Newcomer films ? Yeah . We 're working on a case . It 's evidence . I probably won 't even watch it . But if it 's evidence , won 't you have to watch it ? Not if I can help it. I 'll see you . [ Seductive instrumental music playing on TV ] [ Female Newcomer moaning on TV ] [ Man groaning on TV ] [ Phone rings ] Sikes . virginia : The Giggler called . It 's all set for 8 . : 00 . He wants me alone . - 8 : 00 ? That 's in a half hour . - l already said I 'd do it , Sikes . Okay , I 'll set it up . Look , Bailey , I didn 't have time to sweep the area . So stay on your toes . Right , Sikes . Not that I 'm a chicken or anything , Sikes ... but if you hear anything , get your ass in here , got it ? Got it . Sorry I 'm late . We were planning Em 's birthday party . - l thought it was next week . - lt is , but Emily decided to have it early . All set here . Det . Sikes has placed a tracer tap on the phone line ... and we are now maintaining protective surveillance ... in anticipation of whom , we know not . [ Phone rings ] The phone is ringing now , Sikes . virginia : I 'm taking the call now . MATT : Bailey , standby. lt 's coming down . [ Voyeur laughing ] I 'm really glad you called back . [ Radio static ] Can we have some quiet in here , please ? This static is coming from that microphone . It 's dead. lt 's gone dead . Your mike , shut it off ! [ Virginia screaming ] Damn it , Sikes , get in here ! MATT : Agent down . George , cover the back door . - Bailey , you okay ? - Yeah. I 'm okay , go . virginia : Sikes , he 's getting away . [ Gunshots ] - You okay ? - Where the hell were you , Sikes ? He got away . CAMERAMAN : Over here . Turn that damn thing off . I feel I must become involved when brutality like this is inflicted . I personally intend to see that Virginia has the best of everything ... during her emotional and physical recovery ... which is why she will be convalescing at my estate . I just want it to be known that I will never forget Arvin 's generosity . It means a great deal to me . And no legal action is planned at this time . However , I do believe the community ... should know about the police department 's exploitation of Virginia ... in last night 's failed arrest attempt . I mean , she walked the tightrope . Where were they with the net ? Thank you . That 's all . [ Reporters chattering ] Exploitation ? The king of the gutter is barfing out accusations of exploitation . You call it exploitation , Sikes . I call it seizing the moment . Seizing it ? How about sleazing the moment ? Sikes ! Did you watch the tape I sent ? Did you like it ? - No . - No ? No , what ? You didn 't like it , or you didn 't watch it ? I didn 't watch it . Funny . Nobody ever does . GEORGE : It 's just a matter of time . We need to talk . - Kill it . - Matt , we 're filming . I 'm sorry. I hate it when people get in the way . Come on . You know what ? I have a feeling you are just mean with envy . The word is " green , " George . If it 's the lack of exposure , I 'll put in a good word with Renee ... get you some coverage . I 'm not ticked off because I 'm not on a Wheaties box . I 'm ticked off because she screwed up our stakeout . An electronic malfunction like that could happen to anyone . - l got your malfunction . - You 're mad ' cause ... of all my scheduling conflicts you 've had to deal with . All in all , I 'd say it 's a small price to pay ... - for a much higher objective . - What is that , a new wardrobe for you ? Exposure . A small piece of recognition for my species ... that says , " Slags are people , too . " You know damn well l got nothing against that . But we 're partners , and I 'm tired of dancing solo . - Matt , l- - - Damn it ! The Commissioner is chewing my ass red . You didn 't even trace the call ? Let 's say we had a couple of malfunctions in our way that we didn 't count on . - No , let 's just say you blew it ! - We blew it . Getting a little touchy , are we Sikes ? All right , I 'm sorry . You have spearheaded this case ... but it isn 't like Francisco hasn 't been filling other commitments . I saw your installment last night . You came off like a pro . I thought your segment was very compelling , Captain . If the mutual admiration society doesn 't mind , I got dirt to till . I 'm gonna get Denton 's telephone records . Good . Because the credit card number used last night was just verified . Denton . I think I 'll keep my eye on him , see where he spits . Feel up to a house call , George , or do you have a makeup call ? Francisco 's giving a tour of the Academy this morning , if that 's okay with you . - Keep me informed . - Sure , Bry . Film at 1 1 : 00 . Thanks , Dad . More pre-podial amino regurgitation ? I think I 'm going to lie down . Really , Susan , it would be wonderful if you could take part in the pinata bashing . Yes , it would look better . Well , the show must go on . - You okay , Em ? - Don 't you mean Amelia ? Some guest of honor , the woman can 't even get my name right . Come on , it can 't be that bad . Want to go grab some cake ? Renee said nobody but the caterer can cut it . Something about being union . At least you hit the jackpot with all these presents , huh ? They 're all empty . Renee brought them . Come on , some of your friends must have brought you presents . Buck , look around . Only one of my friends is here ... and she didn 't bring a present , because my real party is next week . Emily . Emily , come on , birthday girl . Come on , have a turn . [ Cheerful birthday song playing on stereo ] Come on , Em . Big smile now . Be happy. lt 's your happy day . I don 't believe you . I don 't think you care at all . Emily , you 've been moping around all day . is this any way to act at your party ? I didn 't want this party . The camera is on . Now please ... try to have a good time . - Play the game . - No ! Kill it . I don 't want this party ! CAMERAMAN : Are we gonna have to do this again or what ? Do we have another pinata ? I can 't hold this amino oozing anymore . Excuse me . Emily ! I would think of all days , your birthday , you could act your age . But it isn 't my birthday , remember ? Buck was right . We might as well be animals in the zoo . - Emily . - l 'm sorry . But I just couldn 't act like I was having a good time ... and act like you 've been ever since you 've been on the news . - Act ? - Yes . Every time Renee says " smile , " we smile . I just couldn 't smile anymore . But I thought you liked the idea of having your birthday on TV . I knew it was real important to you , but ... none of it was real . It 's pretty hard to know what is real anymore . Really , Matt. lt 's an all-night , all-singles laundromat . People go there to find mates for themselves and their socks . I don 't mean to be blunt , Matt , but ever since I came down here to do my laundry ... I 've had this feeling that ... . lt 's a human term ... that you 've been undressing me with your eyes . Me ? Come on . - Then you weren 't ? - No ! I got to go . I didn 't mean to chase you off . And I didn 't mean to lie . I was doing what you said . This wouldn 't have anything to do with that videotape , would it ? No . Yeah . It was pretty explicit . There were a lot of Newcomer women and ... . And you 've never seen that before . Well , my wash is done . The machines are all yours . I get curious , too , Matt . I 've even rented erotic human tapes ... for that very reason . You ? I got curious about the human body . I 've undressed you a couple of times . You have ? Yeah . Well ... . Yeah . MATT : Piesman , I ordered Denton 's phone records yesterday . They 've been sitting on your desk underneath your dry cleaning ? Yeah . Send them down . And Piesman , you 're supposed to hang up dry cleaning ... kind of like I 'm doing with this phone . Well , if it isn 't the invisible man . Where 's your shadow ? Renee and the crew are in the booking area . What 'd you do today , George , get your star on Hollywood Boulevard ? The crew and I spent the day in the Police Chief 's anteroom . - We never did get in to see him . - Fame 's a fickle woman . Matt . I 'm sorry for these last few days . I 've behaved very badly . Emily has opened my eyes to that . I convinced myself that I was doing this for a much higher good ... but I 've let myself be used at the expense of my ... family , my work , and you . Look , George , it could 've happened to anyone . It 's a meat grinder , but who 's to say who 's using who ? You were just seizing the moment , that 's all . Jeez , I think I just quoted Arvin Kaufman . About time . Thanks . - Denton 's phone records ? - Yeah . Bingo . He 's been lying like a stiff at the morgue . Look at all these calls to the sex line . Matt , this number , Arvin Kaufman 's home phone . There 's been several calls from Denton 's home to Kaufman 's home . - All in the last 24 hours . - All since Virginia 's been staying there . Sounds like someone 's obsessed with Virginia , can 't leave her alone . I think we should go speak with Mr. Denton . All right , get the film crew . I thought we could slip out the back . Ernie was on the phone , yelling at his brother-in-law John . I don 't know what about . He roared away when I came over , but he left that box on the workbench . - Virginia 's driver 's license . - He could be heading for her at Kaufman 's . And if he is , we may have trouble . This is useless . All the phone lines are dead . - We 've got cause . Call for backup . - Right . We 're going to have to find another way , George . No , there 's no time . We go over . You ever hear of the Berlin Wall , George ? The one they bulldozed back in ' 90 ? It was half this tall . How many people do you think just scampered over that ? How many of those people were Newcomers ? Come on , I 'll give you a boost . Try anything once . Okay . [ Matt yells ] Nice boost , George . - Sorry . - Let 's go . Don 't move . Didn 't know you were in the window business , Ernie old pal . - lt 's not what you think . - lt never is . Spread ' em . Did you find his gun ? No , he 's clean . Must have dropped it . I don 't have it . Damn it ! Will you listen to me ? I came here to protect Virginia , not to hurt her . I don 't have any time- - [ Virginia screams ] Oh , my God . - Ms . Hamm ? - Virginia ? [ Virginia screams ] Police , freeze ! Drop it ! On your knees , hands behind your back . Wonderful. lt 's Denton 's kid . MATT : You 're both under arrest . GEORGE : You have the right to remain silent . If you give up that right ... anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . Louis , why ? Why did you do these things ? I don 't know . We were just having fun . Fun ? You hurt people . That 's what she does on the videotape . She likes it . That 's not real . You took your father 's gun . - Were you going to hurt her ? - l don 't know . It 's like she was teasing us . She was asking for it . She was asking for it ? That 's all you have to say for yourself ? Ernie ... we should 've seen this coming . He 's always in trouble now , picking fights at school ... the way he 's cruel to his sister . I just don 't know . All right , come on . You take your shot with kids , put a roof over their heads , and hope they turn out . Till guys like him come along and pollute their minds . You know what they say about people who live in glass houses ? - l gave my kid everything . - Yeah . Nudie calendars , slasher movies , a little Voyeur Vision ... over the old man 's shoulder . You gave him everything , all right . We have a good home . We 're hardworking . It 's not just money , it 's responsibility . It 's parental supervision . You ask any shrink around here , he 'll tell you ... a lot of boys get their first dose of sex ... from those violent slasher and porn movies . Give that to a kid who 's already got problems . Look what you get ? Let 's go home , Ernie . So you got all the answers , cop ? - Well , my family 's not like that . - Let 's go home , Ernie . Their statements are complete . You 're free to go . You hit it right on the head , Sikes , and it 's pitiful . You know , parents spend more time watching television ... than they do paying attention to what their kids do . And when the kids aren 't perfect , they point at me . But I have a right to sell it , and they have a right not to buy it . Yeah . I don 't know about right and wrong , but what you do stinks . - Let 's go . - No . Arvin , SFL is not worth what I saw tonight . There are lots of talented actresses out there . I 'll be all right . Well , now you see him , now you don 't . Nice piece of evasiveness , Det . Francisco . Please understand , there was no time to bring you in tow . No time ? The conclusion to the case we 've been covering on you all week ... and you had no time ? I built you an image , made you a hero to the people of LA ... stuck half of Parker Center in your back pocket . - And this is the thanks I get ? - Ms . Longstreet . No , forget the apology. I still have to salvage something out of this . Bernie , come on , we still got to get a couple of shots of the kids ... before they take them to juvenile detention . - No way . You don 't get the kids . - You can 't film them . They 're minors . - lt 's news . - lt 's exploitive and you know it . - Really ? - l 'm not defending what they did ... but the blame is not entirely theirs to take . Look , lady , it 's just a twisted mess of sex and violence . Kaufman sells it , Virginia sells it- - And like it or not , Ms. Eyewitness News , in your own glossy way ... you sell it , too . [ Knocking on door ] - Hi . - Hi . - Come on in . - No. I just wanted to give you this . Not another Arvin Kaufman Presents ? No . This was produced by the University Med School . - You mean on Newcomer sexuality ? - You can rent it in any video store . It may not have the flash and flare of what Kaufman produces ... but I 'll guarantee , it 's a lot more true to life . Great . You 'll probably want to watch it by yourself . Yeah , probably the best way to go . - lf you have any questions ... . - Thanks .

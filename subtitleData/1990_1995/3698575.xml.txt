 I 'm telling you , Wyatt I don 't like it one bit . - Can we just eat , please ? - We created Lisa to serve our needs . This is something I want- - something important to me , something I can learn from . What , am I wrong here ? Give it up , Gary . Lisa 's not going to sleep with you- - not today , not tomo ... What ? that 's your radar look . What are you locked on ? There 's a new girl in the lunchroom checking you out . - Where ? Where ? - 12 : 00 o 'clock . Flowery dress over blue leg thingies . GARY : Who is she ? I don 't know , but she is cute and she can 't take her eye off you . That 's the green light on the traffic signal of love . Wish me luck . Hi . Mind if I sit here ? No . Go ahead . - Gary Wallace . - Amy Cutler . So , what are you studying ? Advanced trigonometry . You any good at it ? Advanced trig ? I 'm a little rusty , but what the hay . Uh , problem number three . I can 't get it . Okay . This is an easy one . You want to start by taking this number here ... - That 's the page number . - Good ! That 's great ! Now , keeping that number in your mind turn to the back of the book ... find the number that matches it , and there 's your answer . Thanks , but that 's cheating . I call it " Creative problem solving . " - She 's taking advanced trig ? - She 's cute , and she 's taking advanced trig ? It caught me off guard . Who goes homework during lunch ? I should have seen it coming . I wouldn 't let it worry you . Just because she 's smarter ... I 'm smart . I 'm right-brain smart ... or is it left-brain smart ? Which side knows to look in the back of the book ? - Right . - That 's me . Amy 's my destiny . She 's also my only prospect , and I 'm not going to blow it . I need to jack up my I.Q. About a million points . Yeah . That 's a tough one . No . No , no , no , no . - No Lisa ! - Yes Lisa . She 's dangerous . Relax . Odds are we 'll come out of this alive . ( Both Yelling ) We 'll be late for the Baywatch cast party . What do you think ? Too revealing ? Guys . Blink . Breathe . Somehting . ( Both Exhaling ) Yep . Too revealing . - So what brings me here today ? - WYATT : Amy Cutler . She 's been scoping Gary . We know she digs me from a distance . It 's the up-close stuff I got to fine-tune . We have to find out what Amy likes . We 're pretty sure Amy 's into smart guys . She 's a brain . I need a brain- - a major brain- - - An Einstein brain . - So that 's your wish . - Be careful how you word this . - Right . I don 't want to be Einstein so don 't go putting his head on my body or my head on his body . - I just want the mind of Albert Einstein . - You got it . What the hell is this ? It 's Einstein 's brain , just as you wished . This isn 't going to help me get a date . This is a brain- - a dead , pickled brain . MAN VOICE : Excuse me but I don 't believe I am dead . It 's the real thing , Gary . Einstein 's brain , just as you wished . Let 's skip over the part where once again you gave me exactly what I didn 't wish for . - You asked for Einstein 's brain . - You knew what I wanted . You deliberately screwed it up . She gets this from your side . MAN : Hello ? - Dr. Einstein ? - Ja . I can hear you but I don 't quite understand where I am . I 'm not going to tell him . Uh , it 's the ' 90s , Professor , and , uh , your brain had been brought back to life and , uh , removed from your body . Incredible . How can I communicate with you ? I am cognizant of speech yet do not possess and vocal physicalization . Trust me , Al . Very complex . You wouldn 't understand . Points is , I had Lisa bring you here to help me bag this babe , see ... Gary , this is Albert Einstein , not Pauly Shore . So let me understand this . You reanimated my brain pulled it through some sort of dimensional rift and dropped it 40 years into the future just to help you impress to girls ? - Yep . - Is she cute ? We didn 't mean to use you , Professor so if you just want - to go back , just say so . - Go back ? Before I 've had a chance to confer with Lisa who manipulates time and space ? Thank you , no . I 'm staying out . It would be an honor to speak with you , Doctor . Please , call me Albert . A bucket of chicken ? You put Einstein 's brain in a bucket of chicken ? I couldn 't find my Scooby-Doo lunch box . Relax . He doesn 't know where he is . ALBERT : Why am I tasting coleslaw ? Don 't worry about it . Just get ready to say something smart . - Lunch ? - What ? Oh . Yeah . I 'm on the Colonel 's special diet plan . You 're on . - So , what are you working on ? - This lab experiment . I 'm measuring the velocity of sound waves through a gelatinous medium . And does this gelatinous medium have little chunks of fruit in it ? Kidding . You got that ? ALBERT : Try 6.38 meters per second . I think it 's 6.38 meters per second . You 're getting pretty handy with the back of the book there . I didn 't check the back of the book for that one . Yeah . Right . We 're doing great . Let 's close the deal . Give me some genius romance stuff . ALBERT : Gary , expressions of love are personal . My feelings and how I express them and different ... Quit stalling , Brainiac , and give me something ! ALBERT : Tell her , her hair glistens like the morning mist off the rhine . Your hair , it glistens like the morning mist off the rhine . What ? ALBERT : Maybe she would like to join you for an evening stroll along the boulevard . Would you like to go an evening stroll with me sometime ? ALBERT : There is a pastry shop in Leipzig that makes the most delicate strudel this side of Stuttgart . There 's this pastry shop in Leipzig ... Do you like Strudel ? I 've tried using the brain . I even tried the romantic stuff . I need a whole new strategy . Why do you talk about her like she 's some deer you 're hunting ? Because this is a hunt ? We 're hunting each other in a savage game of sexual attraction and she is a beautiful , wild deer with big brown eyes and a shiny coat . - Her eyes are blue . - Blue , brown , whatever . You can 't just walk around ! My parents ... Don 't worry . I sent them to a parrallel dimension . Just kidding . They 're at the mall . You know , Gary , Albert and I feel sort of bad that things didn 't work out with Amy . - We still want to help . - If only I knew what she liked in a guy . Perhaps Lisa could help you see through her eyes . - Without actually having her eyes . - Then that 's it . You 'll see through her eyes . See what turns her on . TV : You don 't miss your mother and father one bit . - Maury Povich turns her on ? - No . I get it . It shows you what she 's looking at . She 's watching TV . Oh . Well , that 's a big help . No , no , it 's great . You can see what she 's intro . Then when you ask her out you 'll be sensitive to her . It 's got to work . You think so ? WYATT : She likes Sloppy Joes . I like Sloppy Joes . She 's reading Time Magazine . My parents get Time Magazine . - She 's looking right at you ! - Quick , I got to look cool . - Laugh when I finish this sentence . - I 'm done . ( Laughs ) She 's thinks I 'm hilarious . Now get out of here . We look like we joined at the hip . ( Laughing ) The frosting ... the candles ... somebody 's name ... - a birthday cake ? - Right ! Okay ... Uh , a rainy day ... a lost puppy ... leaving home ... - Things that make you cry ? - A lost puppy ... Casablanca ! - Ah ! Things that are sad . - Yes ! - We make a great team , Albert . - Ja , I agree . Except that you have an unfair advantage over me . I have no conception of your appearance . Oh , well , actually , I 'm kind of plain . Average-looking . Nothing special . It doesn 't matter . I like you for who you are , - not what you look like . - Thank you . I feel the same way about you . Amy , you are one smart woman with extremely good taste . Wyatt ? She likes Wyatt ! Wyatt Donnelly Farber High 's newest dream hunk- - babe magnet extraordinaire . I don 't get it . What popped your clutch , Amy- - his many nervous ticks ? Those contoured yet spongy buttocks ? - How 's Amy-vision ? - It , she , and you suck . I 'm sorry . I must have missed something . - She likes you . - Who does ? " Who does ? " Amy . Amy likes you . Gary , get real . She 's cute , she 's smart , she 's popular . I know my limitations . Well , she doesn 't . She 's been staring at you the whole time not me . Look . Wow ! She is smiling at me ! - I don 't believe this ! - I know . - It sucks . - I 'm sorry , Gary . Now we know what kind of guy she likes- - you . I 'm a gentleman , you 're my friend . There 's only one thing to do . Wearing my clothes won 't make any like you better . And you 're stretching my sweater . You 'd think after the day I 've had you 'd be more supportive . This is ridiculous . Wyatt 's right , Gary . Blue makes you look heavy . Try an autumn color- - maybe olive or brown . Rook to Knight seven . Let Wyatt have a chance with her , Gary . When time and space conspire to bring two people together there 's not much you can do . Knight takes rook . Check . Thanks for the fortune cookie but I have had enough of your advice . ALBERT : You are not being very fair . I may not be fair , but at least I have a skull you freak show . Time out . Maybe Albert has a point here . If Amy 's been flirting with Wyatt all this time maybe he should ask her out . If only it were that simple . You see , Wyatt and I are subject to an ancient code of male conduct . He called dibs . Gary , if you 're still going to pursue this Amy perhaps the best approach is just to be yourself . Another brilliant theory by Albert Einstein . " Just be yourself . " Well , I couldn 't get a date being myself any sooner than you could travel the speed of light . Two for two , Al . But keep cranking out those theories . Gary , you might as well face the fact that Wyatt 's the one with the chance here but he 's going to need your help . Are you going to be a friend or a jerk ? Bishop takes rock . Checkmate in four . ALBERT : Auch du lieber ! I 'm sorry . Is my shattered love life getting in the way of your chess game ? Come on , Albert . I didn 't reanimate your dead and lifeless tissue to watch you be insulted . ( Door Closing ) Okay , ask her out . Don 't worry about Gary . Gary will be just fine . - I don 't know what to say ? - You don 't have to say anything . Gary is a survivor . And Gary can do ... No . I mean to Amy . What do I say to Amy ? Look , try and keep focused here . We 're worried about me and how I 'm going to heal . What if she say no ? I can 't do it . You can , you must , you will . I 'm sorry , Gary was so mean to you . He 's been under a lot of stress . No . Perhaps he 's right . I 'm afraid I let him down . Who am I to advise in matters of the heart ? Your advice was good . Gary 's just ... well , horny . I find you very romantic , Albert . I can 't think of any other brain in a jar with whom I 'd rather share a picnic . Thank you . If I had lips , I could kiss you . More brite ? ( Moans ) Dr Einstein ? Are you awake ? Lisa ... Lisa , Mein leipshien . - Uh , no , it 's me , Wyatt . - Yes , Wyatt . Is something wrong ? I can 't sleep . I keep worrying about Amy . What if she turns me down ? I guess I 'm kind of scared . And well you should be . I may have conquered the riddles of the universe but the rejection of a beautiful woman still scares me . Wonderful . If the greatest mind all time can 't deal with women - what chance have I got ? - Don 't be discouraged . I can tell you a secret that works for me . - Want to hear ? - Sure . The universe is a vast expanding furnace of matter and energy . Relative to this , you are inifinitely small and insignificant your action- - ultimately meaningless . The universe is still going to expand . Nothing you do will charge that . You 're still going to die . - So , does that help ? - You are ... the Albert Einstein , right ? Theory of relativity ? E = MC squared . That 's me . Ja . Mm-hmm . Nothing to worry about . I have confidence in you . Then why are you making me wear this earpiece ? Why ? 'Cause you admit it yourself- - around women you 're a quivering , boneless chicken . - I didn 't say that . - Well , not in so many words . Look , relax . We know she likes you . Just walk up to her . Let me worry about the words . I 'm going home . Oh , no . I finally got over the fact that she likes you better than me . So I want to see you do this 'cause it 's kind of like you 're doing it for the both of us . But only I get to kiss her , right ? We 'll iron out the details later . GARY : You hearing me okay ? You 're doing fine . Keep going . What 's with your butt ? Loosen up . Swing a little . Too much ! Too much ! Okay . She sees you . GARY : Stop staring at her . Look at something else . You don 't care . You 're carefree . Slow down . You 're almost there . Okay , now you 'll come to a stop and you 'll learn casually next to her and you 'll say ... " Hi . My name 's Wyatt . " - Hi , Wyatt . - Hi . My name is Wyatt . Wrong ! Uh , backup plan . Uh , it was a joke . Laugh . - ( Dry laughter ) - Wyatt ? GARY : Stop laughing . You look like an idiot . Ask her where she 's from . Ask her ! What are you waiting for ? Say something . Say , " Where are you from ? " Where from ? It 's a lost cause . Pull out , Wy . Pull out . ALBERT : You 're dying here , Wyatt . You 're dying ! WYATT : I 'm dying ... I 'm dying ... of course ! Einstein was right ! The universe is huge , and I 'm insignificant . Nothing I do matters . So what if she turns me down ? Wyatt , are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . Amy , would you like to go out with me sometime ? I don 't know . I 'd like to but you 're a lot weirder than I thought . - And that 's a bad thing ? - I 'm not sure yet . It 's going great . GARY : Okay now , take a deep breath and on three we 're going to take her hand real slow . Hold hands ... one , two ... Whoa ! You 're ahead of me , but that 's good . I knew we could do this . Okay . " What former sweathog played the lead in saturday night fever ? " ALBERT : Marlene Deitrich ? I don 't know . I hate this game . Is that your answer ? 'Cause you wrong . ALBERT : I 'm suddenly feeling a bit woozy . You 're probably being pulled back to where you belong . Our time together is growing short . I really enjoyed our talks , Albert . ALBERT : I would trade a thousand words to touch your hand just once . ( Horn Honks ) GARY : Great . Your brother 's home . Hmm . I think I can arrange that . - Uh-oh . - ( Waltz Playing ) ALBERT VOICE : You are beautiful look at as you are to talk to . - I 'll miss you , Albert . - And I you , Lisa . CHETT VOICE : Hey , whoever turned out the lights is going to pay for this . You listening , barf bucket ? I 'm going to kick your gangly little butt from here to Taiwan !

Poor man probably purchased some . - Could he have bought those in Melbourne ? - Of course . How did he die ? - Car crash . - Oh , how tragic . - We 're trying to identify him . Do any of your staff come from homesville ? - Homesville ? - Pebbles court , homesville . - Not to my knowledge . All of our employees are local . - What does the v stand for ? - Vitamins , sergeant Johnson . Vitamins .

They did a check on me and found out I knew you . - So what are we here for , Willie ? - Well , the cell walls of his stomach have been eaten away by something corrosive . Enzymes , probably . But they 're not like anything I 've ever seen before . Maybe he was into new drugs . You know , strictly experimental stuff . Now it could be a hybrid from any of those crazy psycho - pharmaceuticals like hemalin , euphoria , deaner , vasopressin , or maybe he was just sniffing texta . - It looks like a nine . - Paul Matthews . - Well , he was one healthy dude . Unnaturally healthy . Now I 'm talking new drugs here , right ? Not just ' 70s designer shit or your ' 80s ghetto powders , I 'm talking fucking ' 90s man . Cognition enhancers .

Detective Phillips , cib . Just wanted to ask you a few questions about the accident here the other day . - Yes , awful , wasn 't it ? - Do you know Mr. Matthews over at number nine ? - We 've only just shifted here . This week as a matter of fact . Me and Brian . He 's my husband . We haven 't met anyone else in the court yet . - No welcoming committee , eh ? Well , if you do happen to see anybody over at number nine could you give us a call on that number ? Thanks . Oh and congratulations . - Thanks . - So how 's the new house ? - It 's okay . I didn 't sleep too well last night though . - Oh , strange bedroom , you 'll get used to it . It could also be the infant . Its protein intake is at its highest at the moment . Particularly at night . Up until their birth , babies are the ultimate parasite . Righto , everything 's under control so don 't you worry and I 'll see you at the same time next week ? - See you then . - You alone ? - Yes , doctor . - We have to decrease Cheryl rand 's dosage . - That will invalidate the results . - Can 't help it . Patient 's overreacting . - I suppose you 're going to ask for further retesting . - We have no other choice . - But we can 't turn back . - We have to change our strategy , my girl . Since your boyfriend foamed at the mouth and kamikazed into pebbles court we have to rethink our position . - How was I supposed to know he could handle that dose ? - Well don 't you see ? That is the problem . The drug is still too unpredictable . - But I have set up an exclusive dealership with one of the largest chain stores in this country . If we delay delivery of the first box shipment ... - fuck the chain store ! What about the cops ? Something is wrong . Your boyfriend underreacted . Cheryl rand is overreacting . What about the two Italian kids ? Have they turned up for their hormonal research yet ? They haven 't have they ? - But we can run simultaneous sperm tests on the noble family without halting the Cheryl rand experiment . - Do not question me , shaan . If this thing goes wrong it will be worse than thalidymide . - Beauville ! We 're shipping the tablets this evening . - But that 's way ahead of schedule . Dr. ( Barrera ... - Dr. carrera is in charge of in-field placement . I 'm handling consignment and distribution . - I thought the doc was in charge of c d . - We must change our strategy , my boy . We do as I say . - Don 't you ever hang up on me again . - But we haven 't spoken for so long . Sounds like we 're in business again . You know where to find me , crackers . - Hi , you must be our new neighbour . I 'm Dr. noble . - Hi . - And I 'm Angelica . - Cheryl . - Oh kids , say hello . Now this is Eloise , my eldest , and that little brat is Brandon . - Can we get a move on ? - Brandon . - Nice to meet you all . When you get back you can come over and meet Brian , my husband . So where are you going ? - Oh it 's a special secret . A holiday we 'll never forget . Bye . - Bye . - Cheryl ? It 's Dr. carrera , Cheryl . - Dr. ( Barrera . I think , I think . Can you drop your placenta one month prior to birth ? - No , I don 't think that 's possible , you see ... - Dr. ( Barrera . Can you come over ? Now ? - I 'm on my way . Brian , Dr. carrera . Can you meet me at your place right away ? No no no , everything 's alright . I 'll explain when we get there . Now , there is nothing to worry about . " Cheryl ! - I never would have expected him to be capable of such a thing . - Murder weapons govern fingerprints . Probably his . You have any other patients in this court , doctor ? - Why ? - You know a Mr. Paul Matthews ? - Ah Matthews , no . - Over at number nine ? - Why , do you suspect him of doing this ? - We had a bad accident here the other day . We have reason to suspect that the victim was on his way to see Paul Matthews . Doctor . Do you know of a viral disease that in its first phase has hallucinogenic delusions ? - Yes , yes there are many of them . - And in its second phase , glandular complications . - Most viruses initially affect cerebral perception in one way or another . Dizziness , vertigo , tunnel vision . - Was Cheryl rand taking any kind of special medication ? - No , no . Not to my knowledge . - It 'll show up in the poor woman 's autopsy , I guess . - Welcome to vinuville . - Alright ! - Dimitra . Folks , meet my tireless assistant dimitra . - Hi . - Any problems she 's yours for the asking . Gotta zap . I 'll meet you back at reception in an hour and I 'll give you your daily fitness programs . - Oh . - Dig in . - All the food you see here is of the same meganutritional value . Designed to appeal to both adults and children alike . You know how it is . Positive deception . - Now why hasn 't somebody thought of that before ? - Excuse me . - This place sucks you know . - You 're so perceptive , bran . - Oh , bit of the pmt , eh sis . - Fuck off , wiener dick . - You bet I 'm gonna fuck off . Tonight I 'll sleep under the stars . - You 're such a he-man , Brandon . - At least I don 't let mum tell me what to wear . - Hope you break your neck ! - Ladies and gentlemen . This one will be over the fucking top . - Sweetie . - Mm . - Are you sure about Brandon ? - Don 't worry . I saw him smuggle his tent in with the luggage . He 's camping outside for the night . - Got a real gem for your pebbles court collection . And check this out . - Holy earache . - And for the grand finale . ~ oh ! - I 've stored the noble 's urine samples . Um , can me and Beau have some more vs ? - So what happened to your last supply ? - Those v2s , they 're piss weak . How about some forte 4s ? - Forget it . You 'll have to wait until your next scheduled ration . - Ach . - Homesville . Pebbles court . Noble family urine analysis . - Hello , I 'm not here just now . Make it short , I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . - Don 't hit the roof when you see this data . I know we can push ahead with some further tests on the nobles tomorrow . Their urine looks really good . - Yanta fucking bulla . Your friendly health farm hostess , hey Sam . - Get a chopper . Now . - Just what the doctor ordered . - Did you see Angelica 's split ends ? - I 'd rather see your split end . - Beau . This is getting a little out of hand . We haven 't even had breakfast yet . - But I 'm not hungry . Well , yes I am . - Oh Beau , stop it . Stop it ! - Ow . - I 'm going to the bistro to have some breakfast . You should take a cold shower . - So . Still into driving a merc are we , crackers ? - Don 't forget that your advanced hearing is the result of my chemical breakthroughs , pud . - At least I had the guts to experiment with the drugs on myself . - That is what partnerships are all about . - So . How 's it going , cracker ? Done any good drugs lately ? - You know what I want . What is this ? - Well , when we parted company i made sure I took a little something from the lab . I knew you 'd give your master plan a second shot . You see , without that little additive , the body cannot control his new powers . It might even explode . Very fucking messy . It 's all falling apart , hey crackers . All those people at vimuville . You and your megabods . You fucking Bob geldof of the gym set ! You were wrong then and I made sure you 're wrong now ! I love it ! I need it ! Yeah ! It 's a power machine ! All right ! Hold tight - oh shit . - Thomps ? You alright ? - It 's alright , nothing to worry about . - Thomps ? Eloise , Eloise ! - Shaan ? Quick , mum needs help , something 's wrong with dad . - Vimuville , the best place in the world for your body . - Quick , in the car ! Oh my god ! - This must be the place . - Quick , get the doctor , we 've got to see the doctor immediately ! - I 'm sorry , you 're going to have to take ... - oh don 't give me that shit , just get the doctor ! You 've got to come up to vimuville , something terrible 's happened . - Vimuville ? What are you doing up at that old chemical dump ? I haven 't been there since it was closed . By the health commission . That must be over 20 years ago . - The food . The food , they 've all eaten it ! - Why don 't you just come into the surgery and we 'll see what we can . Yes madam , I 'm listening . - The human body . At best , a neglected engine running on cheap fuel . - Way I see it , doc , you 're running on empty . - You would not have the faintest idea of what your body could do . If it had the right formula . But without that fuel you are nothing . A zero . - Finished , Dr. carrera ? - No , not quite , detective Phillips . - Don 't even think about it . 645 to airborn 19-ls Sam still with you ? - Yep , still here . We 're putting through that quarantine you requested for pebbles court , but Sam , yeah ? - That fucking freak 's been choking up for the past 20 minutes down here , it 's wall to wall shit all over the place . Now look , we finally caught him in your office , Sam . Now the only trouble is that young Jordan 's trapped in there with him . - In my office ? - Move it , everyone covered ! Move it ! Oh god , come down . Keep down ! Keep those corridors covered , keep them covered ! - Fuck a duck . Jordon , now . Jordon , now ! - Sam , over here . Keep away from the door ! What the fuck 's wrong with this guy ? Is he sick or infected or what ? - Sarge , get me the fuck out of here ! - Get the paramedics . Get Willy up here now ! - He 's got my fucking shirt on . - Cognition enhancers , eh Willy ? You should see the bodies coming down from that crazy bloody farm . - Should see the new death certificates . Death by hypernatural causes . Eh ? I can 't help it - i love this fucking job . Oh , not feeling queasy are we , johno ? - What would you suggest , Willy ? - I suggest some aspirin , johno . - Sam ? Would you get me some aspirin , please ? - Ah , catch that speed freak yet ? - Yeah , he bagged himself . - That guy was one crazy arsehole . Ate detergent ! Jesus !

He followed the old woman home from the market and almost killed her 27 credits for drugs . Your drugs . - This is harassment , captain . You have no legal right to talk to my client Without counsel present . - You 're welcome to lodge a complaint . - I 'll have you in court before you ever see my client there . They can 't use a word you said , Mr. Wolf . - Yeah , well lucky for you , your client 's has been given silent treatment . But lucky for me , this boy hasn 't . Says he buys his highs from Mr. Wolf , here . - Huh- - That 's it ? That 's why you pulled us in ? Because some Convicted felon told you a story ? - Yeah , well , a lead 's a lead- - I had to ask . - Then , ask . - You ever seen this boy before ? - No . - So , you never sold him drugs ? - He answered the question , Brogan . - You 've ever sold drugs to kids ? - Of course not . - Have you ever sold illegal drugs ? - That 's it . You want to go fishing , do it on your own time , Brogan . You heard my client , captain . Now , hear me . This is the third time in a month that Brogan 's badgered Mr. Wolf . He needs a new Hobby . And you need to get your cops in line . Now , either press charges , or open that door . - It 's my word against the kid 's . - It 's not your word that bothers me . It 's hers . - Please , somebody help me . I was followed home and there 's a man in my apartment . I 'm so scared . I don 't know what to do . I 'm sure he 's hiding . Oh , god ! - You 're getting reckless . - I 'm getting closer . - the cemetery 's are full of people who got closer to amory Wolf . Call it a day , lieutenant . - It was a lucky shot . - Dream on . - If bronkers doesn 't check in to the dead zone , lemor hasn 't got a chance . - I can 't talk slamball with you , orrin . It 's a total waste of time . - is this it , slomo ? - You are looking at the compete file , lieutenant . - Well , there is nothing here I can use . - Look , Brogan- - Nobody 's blast proof . Not even Wolf . - No , haldane- - Not your paperwork . - Come on- - It 's what you 're good at . - You have no idea what I 'm good at . - the kid you pulled in for possession ... they just found him in an alley- - Od 'd . - What was he doin out of jail . - He made bail . - With what ? He was broke . - Yeah . Amory Wolf- - And I showed him the kid 's picture . - don 't blame yourself , Brogan . If Wolf wants to nail someone , he doesn 't need a picture . Not this boys . Not yours , so be careful . - guys ? We got a research lab Says someone stole a bug and we got a ballroom brawl at the sports pit . - All right . We 'll take the bar you take the bugs . - Absolutely not . Took and I 'll take the sport 's pit . Yeah . - You sure about that ? - I 'm not afraid of ballroom brawls , haldane . And I resent the fact that you automatically think women can 't handle them . - Oh , come on , Janie . It 's falling on deaf ears . - You afraid of creepy crawlies ? - I didn 't know you had a thing about bugs ? - I don 't- - they got a thing about me . - Forced entry . No prints . Security guard missing . - Inside job ? - Well , I suppose the forced entry could 've been faked . - All right- - Get on an apb on the guard . - right . - Officers , I 'm doctor long . Project Leader for dexcor pharmaceuticals . - Doctor long , was this , uh , bug part of your project ? - The bug was the project . Taranosis eternecum ... the forever beetle . Magnificent and rare . Close to extinction . The female that was stolen was the last of its kind . It had only recently been discovered . Emerging after 17 years underground . - Wow- - 17 years . - When the mature beetle surfaces , it begins its metamorphosis into a spectacular butterfly . Which lays around a million eggs . - So , what are we talkin ' here ? Savin ' the species ? - Right . In captivity , hundreds of eggs could survive . - Hmmm . Um , your guard 's missing . You think he took your bug ? - Albert vent ? It 's hard to believe . The forever beetle was his life . - Yeah , well , what better reason to steal it . - There is a better reason . Let me show you something . You are about to witness an EXPERIMENT conducted under my supervision . This is Sena m . The subject of the experiment . Sena was born without the complete fingers of the right hand . The experiment involved the application of a drug we developed . We hoped it would stimulate cell regeneration . - did it work ? - Just watch . Five days . Ten days . Fifteen days . - my god . - We found the drug in the womb of taranosis eternecum ... - The forever beetle . - If only we could learn how to synthesize the chemical . - Your competitors like to get their hands on that bug . - They may already have . - Okay , break it up , everyone ! Break it up ! - Come on-Come on ! You , over to this side . - You know who started this ? Break it up ! - Men can be so aggressive . - Tell me about it . - Hey , isn 't it about time you redecorated ? - is he the one who started it ? - Finally got here , huh ? You missed a great fight . - Put your hands on the bar . - Anything you say , honey . - Keep your mouth shut . - Great hands . You doin anything later ? - No , but you are . - Oh , yeah . - Got a date with a jail cell . - Another one for the cage , sergeant . - Charges ? - Drunken disorderly , reckless endangerment and the destruction of private property . - Name ? - What 's your name ? - Sergeant , tell them my name , please ? - Thunder Cole ! - Hey ! - Hey , it 's the man himself . - Hey- - Look who 's back ! - Thunder ! It-it-It 's you ! I don 't believe it- - What 's the problem ? - Is there somethin we could do to help ? - Nah , these two kind ladies just brought me up here , to show me around . - Janie , are you nuts ? Lose the cuffs ! - Look , I 'm sorry about this , thunder . There 's been a mistake here . - What 's going on here- - Who is this ? - Thunder Cole ! - Oh , big deal . Let 's go . - Hey , look . - It 's thunder Cole . - don 't worry , thunder . We 'll get this figured out . - Yeah- - All right . - We 'll get you outta here in no time . - Hey , thunder ! - Hey-Hey- - Thunder Cole ! Whoa . The sport 's pit ? I knew we shoulda taken that . Look- - Just let me apologize in behalf of the 88th . - don 't you dare apologize for me . This is thunder Cole . The greatest slam ball player in the history of the game . - if you 'd be so kind . - I don 't think that 's be necessary . Took ? Let 's take Mr. Cole to one of our best cells . - Sally , I- - - Patrick , you 've said it yourself . He always overstays his welcome . I mean , he 's a free loader . - I never said he was free loader . - look , I know he 's your best friend , but I-I-I- - - Honey , I never said he was a free loader . - You implied it- - Look-Look at us . We 're arguing again . - I 'm not arguing . - Patrick , please . I just want him to stay somewhere else . - All right- - I 'll talk to him tonight . - Well , I don 't think you 're gonna have to wait that long . - What ? - Hey , Buddy . - Uh , it 's okay , fredo- - Uh , let him in . - Have fun . - Hey , murph ! What are you doin ' here , man ? - I need a favor . I 've got some meeting 's in demeter . I was wondering if I could borrow your Hopper to get around ? - Yeah , sure . - Thanks , dad . - Look , we got to talk . - I promise I 'll only be a couple hours . I promise . - Who 's that guy ? - Tommy Murphy . He 's staying a few days at our house . We grew up together . School , scouts , sports . Best halfback I ever saw . Best man at my wedding . Best friend . - Oh . - What a hero . You know , I saw him about three months ago . He wiped the field with the rest of them . - Yep- - He was brilliant . - What a player . - Absolutely brilliant . - I model myself on him , you know ? - Why don 't you get a life , orrin ? - What- - I 'm only sayin ' . - Bomb alert ! Bomb Alert- - Explosion ... I repeat , explosion in ... - Murphy ! No ! - Buddy , it 's too late . - Kids okay ? - Liz is , um , asleep . Matt 's pretty restless . - We used to dare eachother . You know , see who 'd get scared . He 'd , um- - He 'd ride his bike down a flight of stairs at school . Dared me to do it and I would . I 'd , uh , climb upon the roof ... and walk along the Peak and dare him to do it and he would . And I remember when - When we got older- - Mmm ... dared me to-to kiss a girl . And for the first time I was scared . Then one day , I dared him to get married . He said he would when he found another you . It was his way of saying , he was never gonna get married . And it was his way of saying , if anything ever happened to me , he 'd take care of you . That bomb was meant for me , Sal . - No . - Well , the good news is the device was made by an amateur ? - That 's good news ? - It was a lousy bomb . - How good does a bomb have to be ? Isn 't good enough to kill somebody good enough ? Or does it have to score style points , too ? - Back off- - You know what I mean ! - No , I don 't ! - A good bomb , a really good bomb doesn 't leave anything behind . Nothing to examine . Nothing to identify . Nothing to piece together . I 'm sorry about your friend , lieutenant . I truly am . But this bomb is the best chance we 've got to catch the guy who did it . - They got to pull an amory Wolf . - They already have . - What 's goin ' on ? - You 're too close , Brogan . And too angry . - He 's right . - I don 't believe this . - This is getting tedious . - You 're right . - Well , just don 't lave demeter , Mr. Wolf . Who knows- - We may need to talk again . - Just make sure you call me first . - Oh , Brogan ! Sorry you missed our little chat . - We need to talk . - No way . - alone . - You can read their report . - Okay , Brogan . You got it . - Mr. Wolf , I don 't advice this . - Let me get you a cup of coffee , Mr. Pike . - Thank you- - Yes . - You just made the biggest mistake of your life . Number one- - You messed up . I 'm still here . Number two- - You killed my friend . Number three- - You got sloppy you left a Trail . I 'm gonna get you Wolf- - It 's called payback . Number one- - If you think I 'm the only person who wants to dance on your grave , you 're dumber than I thought . Number two- - I don 't leave trails . Look for someone who does . And number three- - you ain 't worth the risk to kill . But if you should ever do somethin ' dumb enough to make me change my mind , you won 't know what hit ya . - Here 's the rest of the list , lieutenant . I didn 't realize you were such an unpopular guy . - Thanks- - I needed that . - What do you got ? Enemies ... hundreds of ' em . - Did you rule out Wolf yet ? - Yeah , for now . Anybody on this list could 've planted that bomb . - Thunder ... what are you doing here ? You 're out on bail . - Ah , that 's been fixed . Officer orrin around ? - Yeah , right over there- - Go on through . - Come on in , thunder . Orrin-Orrin- - Look who 's here ! Hey , jam- - Lookin ' good ! - Listen , I want to thank you again for what you did . You 'll be my guest at saturday 's championship game ? - Hey , this isn 't graft is it ? - Hey , thanks to the old man here . The sport 's bet dropped all charges . Me and babbs kissed for the cameras . Great publicity . - So , you 're a hero now ! Let 's see those tickets . - Officer castle ... - if you 're going to try to use those tickets to apologize to me , don 't . You 're wasting your time . I can 't stand slamball . I think it 's pointless , primitive and idiotic . - What ? - Oh . - Please-Please ! The lady 's entitled to her opinion . Which I respect . Would you , uh , let me apologize to you over dinner at flax ? - Okay . - Hey ! - I 'll see you later , then , huh ? - Yeah , catch you later , thunder . - See you soon ? - Hey , all right . - Hey , he 's a friend of mine . We got tickets to the game ! - Sorry , zil- - They 're bad for ya . Trust me . I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . Mom and Liz will be home soon . Squawk at them . Don 't tell , zil . I don 't believe that dumb thing . - What are we looking for ? - a beetle- - That 's what we 're looking for ! It 's got to be here somewhere ! Take a look over there ! - There 's nothing in this room ! - Just keep looking ! - I 'm looking-I 'm looking . - There , now . Over there . - there 's nothin ' there ! - Try the rooms down here . - Yeah , okay . - I 'll get the study ! You take the kid 's room . - Okay , okay , I 'm goin ' . - Hey , what was that ? - I don 't know- - an airlock ? - We 're out of here . - Oh , come up- - Move it ! - I 'm movin ' - I 'm movin ' ! - go ! - I 'm not gonna miss a thing . I promise you , lieutenant . - I know- - You 're right . I 'm sorry . They didn 't take anything valuable . Cash , jewelry , nothin ' . - No . It looks like they came to wreck the place . - Yeah , but why ? There 's got to be a reason . - We 'll get them , sir . - You better check over here . - It 's coming through , Matt . - Just a little more , honey . - I hope it turns out all right . I only got a quick look at them . - You 're doin fine , Matt . - So , how was your date with thunder ? - You don 't want to know . - Uh , sure we do . - No you don 't . - What happened ? We want details . - Well , he spent most of the time going from table to table working the room . - Hey , he 's a famous guy . It 's hard for him . - that 's no excuse . - People want to talk , say hello . He has to be polite . - Yeah ? Well , he ignored me . I don 't think that 's very polite . - Oh , how about the food ? Was that good ? - I don 't know . I left before it was served . - What ? - After the fight . - the fight ? - I told him I didn 't appreciate being stranded at the table . He said I was too uptight . I disagreed and then he told me what he thought I needed . And then that 's when I got up and slapped him . - You hit thunder Cole ! - Uhhh , and I was so looking forward to the wedding . - Just cannot believe that . - I cannot believe that . I just cannot believe it . - Hey , how was your date with superman ? - Terrible , okay ? - Why are you so uptight ? You know what you need- - Ah . - Quit foolin around , haldane . The lieutenant 's waiting in the cruiser . We just got a reported sighting of the two guys who trashed his place . - Angel , rob , and yat nardo . Doesn 't make sense . They 're not on that list of yours . - Yeah , well maybe I arrested the guy that hired him . - Tell you what , we 'll ask him when we catch ' em . - Freeze ! - I got him . - Get in there ! - Crazy , man . Hey ! - Damn ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Ugh ! - Freeze ! Get down from there ! Do it now ! Turn around ! Grab the bars ! And you were gonna talk to me . - Drop dead . - I 'm gonna count to three . If you don 't tell me why you trashed my home , scared my kid and killed my friend ! I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . - One- - - You got to believe me ! - Two- - - I swear to you ! I never killed your friend . - Easy , Brogan . - Stay out of this . - Look , all I know is we did some cops house in the burbs . Your house . Didn 't find what we were lookin ' for ? - What was that ? - I-I don 't know . Some bug or something . A beetle . - The forever beetle ? - Yeah ... Yeah , that 's it . Your friend ... Murphy . He had it . He already sold it to our client , but he-He died before delivery . - You 're telling me , Tommy Murphy had the forever beetle in my house ? - I told you it wasn 't there . - Who was your client ? - Oh , man ! I can 't tell you that . Oh , all right . All right- - It was xana farmix . - It 's number two to dexcor , their main competition . - Get him out of here . - Ugh- - Hey ! Ugh ! - Hello , anybody home ! I 'm here ! Liz ! Matt ! Oh , dear . Unbelievable . Hmm . Oh . Um . - Fredo ? Meet nardo and Rupp , homewreckers . Book ' em- - Show ' em a cell . - when you 're done with those two , fredo , can you check the bank accounts for xana farmix . See if they made a large cash withdrawal sometime in the last two or three days . - Ah , seems your friend Murphy had a long history of Petty thefts . This time , he sees a chance to strike it rich , so he steals the bug from one lab and sells it to the competition for a fortune . - Yeah , and kill somebody in the process . - Ah , maybe- - Maybe not . We haven 't found the security guard yet . For all we know he was Murphy 's partner in this , huh ? - Yeah . Spend your life with somebody . You think you know 'em , and then this . - This is a bank statement from xana farmix . They made a 500,000 credit withdrawal the day before Murphy was killed . - I checked out the blood stains from your Hopper . We got a match . You won 't believe it . It was vent . - Vent ? - Who 's he ? - The missing security guard from dexcor . He was in the Hopper when it exploded . Not Murphy . - Murphy 's alive ? - What are you doin ' with that ? - I found it in Matt 's room . It was loaded . - I got to deal with this . - You 're gonna deal with me , first . - You know how many times I talked to him about guns ? - He didn 't buy that gun to break your precious house rules . He bought it because they 're people out there who can come into our house , into our lives , and hurt us- - Kill us . And he 's not about to let that happen . Not when he can do something about it . He loves you so much he 's willing to die for you , or kill for you . I 'm not angry at him for that . - Murphy didn 't fake his death , so he could take the money and run . - I agree . He faked his death , so we 'd stop looking for him . - Exactly , because he needs more time . - More time for what ? - To get more money . He still got the bug . - huh . More money- - Huh ! From who ? Xana farmix ? They 're a little short of cash right now . We 've seen their bank statements . - right . - But there 's one other drug company that could afford it . The same one he stole it from in the first place . - Dexcor , our old friend doctor long . - Why sell it once , when you can sell it twice . Get a hold of this information for me right away . - Sure thing , lieutenant . - Yeah Well , some friend this guy . Could 've faked his death a hundred different ways and not involved you . - Nah , he wanted me to see him get killed . I 'm a perfect witness . If the police say he 's dead , he 's dead . - Yeah , he makes the bomb look like it 's meant for you to throw us off track . Smart . - and all the time he 's sleepin ' at my house . And I can 't figure that out . Why 'd he stay the night ? He could 've still come by the station and borrowed the Hopper . - Cheaper than a hotel room ? No- - It was a move . I 've known Murphy a long time . He never wastes a move . - Did you see the look on his face when you brought that stamp down on his hand ? Tarn males are so different . If they feel something , they say it . I don 't understand human male emotion at all . - Join the club . - Hey , guys ? We got another bar room brawl at the sports pit . Thought I 'd give you first dibs . - Orrin , whattya got ? - All right , lieutenant- - here it is . Dexcor pharmaceuticals did not make any kind of withdrawals within a week of Murphy 's so-Called death . - Your kidding . - But they made a whopper this morning . - Thanks , orrin . - Okay , everyone- - Up against the bar . Turn around . - Right- - Move it ! - Hands on the bar . - You 're wasting your time . We 've been through all this before . - Did I ever tell you guys me and miss police officer went on a date the other night . - way to go , thunder . - I had a great time . After she left . She 's a real cutie . A little uptight . And we all know what she needs . - You do , huh ? - You better believe it , baby . - and you 're the one who can give it to me ? - If you pick the lucky number . - Janie ? - Come on- - Show her . Pick a lucky number , eh ? - Like she did ? Come on . - Yes . I got it from the bank this morning . I didn 't know what else to do . He said if I called you , he 'd destroy the beetle . I couldn 't bear that , so I got the money . - What did you agree on ? - Why he 's bringing it here in half an hour . Look , please don 't interfere . I just want to get that beetle back . - Brogan ? - Lieutenant , you wanted me ? - All right- - This is important . When you dusted , what rooms did you find Murphy 's prints in ? - Just a sec . Here we go . Hallway , living room , dining room , kitchen , kid 's room . - Uh , which room ? - Matt 's room- - All over the closet door . - Okay , thanks . You thinkin what I 'm thinkin ' ? - Yeah- - the bug is in the closet . - Yeah , like I said Murphy Never wastes a move . He 's probably on his way there right now . Matt 's not home from school yet . All right- - You stay here in case Murphy 's already on his way down . - How did it get out of it 's box ! It must be here somewhere ! You must 've seen it ! Did you take it out of the box ? - I told you , I didn 't know it was in here , uncle murph . Look , the guys that broke into our house , they-they-They tore everything apart . It must 've - it must 've gotten out . - it-it-It didn 't just disappear out of thin air ! It 's got to be here somewhere . - I 'll help you look . - You-Stay-Right where I can see you . And don 't say a word , or I 'll swear I 'll- - - You 'll what , Murphy ? - Leave the room , son . Shut the door . Call the station for backup . I trusted you , Murphy . I cried for you . You were my friend . - All those contributions to the department 's insurance fund . They haven 't gone for naught . You 're the proud owner of a brand-New Hopper . I know how tough this was for you . - Ever since we were kids I made excuses for him . I let him get away with all kinds of things because we were friends . He counted on that . - Well , you can 't be a cop without seeing the world in a different way , Brogan . You know we have to live with things that other people would sweep under the carpet . You did a good job , lieutenant . - All right . Check your belongings and sign . - Nothing personal , sergeant , but I 'm gonna count my money . - Oh . - Hey guys , need some tickets ? - Did you hear something ? - Nah , just some sleaze bag makin ' a lot of noise . - Yeah , that 's what I thought . - Do you want tickets for tonight 's game ? - You got to be kidding . - What 's the Matta with you guys ? - No , stay . I need a witness . Look , I-I hate it when people make assumptions about me and I realized that I was making assumptions about you , so I 'm sorry . I guess I deserved to get stamped . - Yes , you did . - that 's it ? I thought she 'd at least have dinner with me . - I guess that qualifies as another assumption . Hm ? - Yeah , I know . You probably think you 're too old for this , but it makes me feel good . - It makes me feel good , too . Dad , I 'm sorry about the gun , it was really stupid . - No . No , it wasn 't . It was dangerous and it was illegal , but it wasn 't stupid . You were just reacting to a situation you should 've never been put in in the first place . You 're being very brave . - Hey , dad ? - Hmm ? - Don 't some people sometimes get rewards for being brave ? - Yeah , I guess we could , uh , spot you a few extra credits this week . As long as you clean up this desk . Good night . - What about you- - You okay ? - Well , I think about Murphy being in prison for the rest of his life , and I think I 'm really lucky I got you guys .

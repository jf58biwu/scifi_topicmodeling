 In 1992 , there were 543,767 violent incidents in American high schools . In some cities , the areas around these schools were beginning to fall under the control of violent youth gangs . By 1997 , the number of violent incidents had tripled . Gangs had taken control of large sections of these cities . Some schools were shut down . The year is 1999 . The gang-controlled areas have become known as ... free-fire zones . Kennedy High is located in the middle of a free-fire zone . The police will not enter . There is no law . The Department of Educational Defense has been formed to reopen the schools and control the gangs . Ladies and gentlemen , I know that when you asked Megatech to help you with your problem , it wasn 't an easy decision . You are , after all , educators . We are automation and robotic specialists . At first glance , not exactly compatible fields . But the current situation in our high schools calls for unusual measures . Meet the pride of Megatech . It 's as fine a group of educators as you 'll find anywhere in the world . I guess you could call them super teachers . Cody Culp , come with me . You 're getting out . These artificially created tactical education units have been thoroughly programmed in history , chemistry , all mathematics ... and of course , physical education . And they also come equipped with the option of XT-6 hardware to deal with discipline problems . It 's hard for me to believe that they 're not actually human beings . Mr. Bryles ? One million megabytes . Don 't be scared . What ? Sign it . You 'll report to your school by 9 : 00 AM , Culp , or we 'll have your ass back here . You violate any of the terms of your parole , we 'll be waiting with open arms to welcome you back to the real world of discipline . Now , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to present to you the Principal of Kennedy High School , Mr. Myles Langford . Dr. Forrest , thank you . That was indeed impressive . This secret program , sponsored by the Department of Educational Defense and Megatech , is going to make it possible for classes to resume once again at Kennedy High School . You all know what we 've had to face in the past ... drugs , gang activity , rampant violence . And of course this group of particularly troublesome students with prison records who , because of this experiment , will be released back into the school population today . Hey . How you doing , man ? How was it in there ? All right . You look like shit , Angel . What do you mean ? He 's a bad little dude . Yeah . I 'm getting jumped in next week . Let 's get out of here . - I 'm driving . - Back seat . Come on . Destruction , yeah Till there 's no one there If you ain 't from the gang You better watch your step ... - Where to ? - Wanna get high ? School . School ! Oh , man . You definitely want to get high . What is it ? Edge , man . Best new high since Skin . Cool ! - Come on ! - What 'd they do to you in there , man ? You used to enjoy gettin wrecked with your brothers . Times change ... brother . Cops gave this place up . We can 't go this way . Motherfuckin ' Razorheads control this whole area now , man . What the fuck are you doing ? Get us out of here , Cody . Welcome home , C-C-Cody . Meet any nice boys in jail ? Yeah . You should have been there . He would have liked you . See you at school , assholes . Ow ! Come on ! Get that Cody ! Kill him ! - Get out of here ! - Go go go go ! Shut up ! Hey ! Get down ! Go ahead ! Get him ! Get Cody ! Hold on . Faster , Cody , faster ! Go ! Fuck ! Looks like Hector 's gonna be a little late for school . Ha . It 's gonna be good to have you back with us , man . Ow ! God ! What 's going on ? This is a free-fire zone . Yeah , the cops still won 't come in here so they got their own goons now . Maybe I should 'a stayed in prison . Welcome , students , to Kennedy High School . All weapons must be surrendered before entering the school grounds . - Out of the way . - You got a search warrant ? You got a search warrant ? Get away from my car , man . You wanna make this tough ? Huh ? - Sonny ! - Let him go ! Hold it right there . Hold it right there . Sonny ! Sonny ! I 'm not kidding ! - Get your friend out of here . - Sonny ! - What about Sonny ? - Forget about him . Do yourself a favor . You 're turning into a real douchebag , you know ? Why don 't you just go fuck yourself ? Any student caught on school premises with an automatic weapon will be detained by school security and turned over to the proper authorities . Your brother says you don 't want to be a Blackheart anymore . So what if I don 't ? These guys are our friends . So if you ain 't with us , you 're against us . So that means we got to kill you . Yeah , and that 'd make us sad , Cody . Gee , Dawn , I 'm touched . So what 's it gonna be , Cody ? I 'm lying low for a while . If I get slammed for ganging , I 'll be doing real hard time . Guess you 'll have to waste me . Either way I 'm dead . Come on , Angel . Let 's go . Hey , you ! - March march . - All right , come on . Shrapnel . Yeah , let me see your papers . Good morning . - Good morning , Dr. Forrest . - Good morning , sir . Mr. Hardin , Miss Connors and Mr. Bryles , this is the first day of the rest of your lives . These are our problem students . I 've made sure to assign them to your classes . We know what we 're here to do , Mr. Langford . Academics will be up . Discipline will be firm . Well , if there are any problems , my door is always open . Don 't move it ! Come on ! There won 't be any problems . Saturday , or I 'll make earrings out of your balls . You 're a real badass , huh ? Fuckin ' $ 10 . Guess you gotta be a millionaire to go to school here . Here she comes , Mark . I don 't have the money . You 're gonna find your balls in a vise , asshole . Good morning , students . Good morning , students . Good morning , bitch . I 'm Miss Connors , your chemistry teacher . And welcome to the wonderful world of chemistry . - You got it ? - You 're gonna pay us , aren 't you ? Please be seated . Fuck off . Internal systems on alert , Dr. Forrest . Switch over to Connors ' class . I think he said ... fuck you . What are you laughing at ? System making process of order . Skin temperatures increasing , sir . Gentlemen , if you 're going to be in my class ... She 's moving . She 's approaching the students . - You 're going to have to be cool . Baby , I got cool for you right here , honey . Right here . You 're gonna have to walk cool . You 're gonna have to stand cool . We don 't got to do nothing , lady . And if you cannot , you will sit down . I ain 't finished . I 'm still 60 bucks short , asshole . That 's not very cool . " That 's not very cool . " Temperature 's increasing . Breathing 's increasing . Approaching critical . Baby , can 't you see I 'm trying to conduct a little business here ? Not in my class . Hey , don 't you mess with my boys , Miss Connors . God ! - Reflex time , Mark ? - .027 . - .027 . - Falls within the parameter , sir . Reflexes normal . Now that I have your undivided attention , we 'll have roll call . And I see we 're going to have some very ... Breathing returning to normal . Temperature returning to normal . Education at its finest . Congratulations , sir . Ah , can you believe that woman ? Chemistry teacher from hell . Uh , hi , I 'm Christie . I would have introduced myself in class but I was afraid Sheera the Devil Woman would bite me . What a drag that class is gonna be . Girls like you usually love everything about school . What do you mean , " girls like me " ? Nothing . I don 't know . You new here ? Yeah , I just transferred from Nixon . My dad was a little worried about it , but he said as long as I stayed away from gang guys ... He don 't want to hang out with us , does he ? He just wants to kiss up to her . You might as well stick your dick in a meat grinder , Cody . I don 't know what you guys are talking about . Ah , I do . My dad 's the new principal . - Perfect . - Yeah , maybe for you . It is so embarrassing . I might as well go around with " geek " tattooed on my forehead . Cody Culp . Blackheart for life , whether I like it or not . You , uh , you want to do something sometime ? I 'm sure your dad would love that . I didn 't ask you if you wanted to do something with my dad . Well , this is my class . So , uh , are you gonna call me or what ? Yeah . Both . Good morning , ladies and gentlemen . I can 't hear you ! Way to go ! All right , let 's make several things perfectly clear , shall we ? This is going to be the most difficult history course you 've ever had . For you . Expect a test every two weeks , two hours of homework , each and every night for the remainder of the year , for the rest of your life . Something ... something a little more important ... I operate from a model ... - of ab ... - Spit it out ! - Solute zero tolerance . So do we . And that means behavior in ... or out of this classroom . No roaming the corridors without a pass . No disrespect or disobedience . - Shut up . - Why don 't you shut the fuck ... And last , uh , there 'll be no excuses ... whatsoever . Why don 't you shut the fuck up ? Hey , fuck you , mook . Have I made myself perfectly clear ? He 's making his decision now . Corporal punishment ... is that still legal , sir ? Whatever 's necessary to keep the children in line . Anybody else ? Hey , Cody . I made sure that nothing happened to your bike the whole time you were gone . - You should give me the car . - You don 't have a license . Big deal . Neither do you . What the hell happened to you ? They got me in the parking lot . You fucks ran off and left me . Look at this ... yeah . Who did it ? The Razorheads ? Fuckin ' Nazi security guards turned me over to the new history teacher . The guy ... the guy 's insane . Got any money ? I really need a hit . They took everything away from me . I haven 't had any all day . Come on , Angel , you got any Edge on you ? - I 'm really hurting . - Hey , look in the kitchen , Angel . Maybe there 's some Drano or floor cleanser ... that 'd be even more fun , huh ? This is plenty ! Hands off that ! - No ! - Stop that ! Get your hands off it . Get your hands off that . Give me that . Give it to me . - Give it to me . - Mom , I need it . Stop it ! Give it to me . Look who 's here , Mom . - Find your own drugs ! - No , you gotta give it to me . Gee ! It 's good to be back home . You 're all fuckin pathetic ! - You 're a rat . - Come on , give it to me ! I need it ! Next . No gang jackets or colors allowed on campus . No sexual activity of any kind permitted . Hey , you think smart girls give better head ? Hey , you . Hey , baby . Hey , you ... principal 's daughter . Hey , fuck off , okay ? Ooh , such nasty language . What would Daddy say ? Would you just leave me alone ? - Leave you alone ? - Hey ! What are you doing ? Stop ! Help ! No ! No ! Help ! Hey , stay here . Come on ! Come on , man ! Get him back ! You 're coming with me , Culp . You know the terms and conditions of your release ... no altercations of any kind . That boy ended up in the hospital . That boy nearly raped your daughter . I appreciate what you tried to do . Why didn 't you go to a teacher for help ? Like him ? This bitch nearly broke my arm . Mr. Bryles , thank you . Perhaps Mr. Bryles did overreact . All right . All things considered , I won 't put this on your record . But this is the last warning . Now you understand that ? Yes , sir . Good . Right , I 'm releasing you to your next class - which is ... - Phys Ed , I believe . Thanks you , Mr. Bryles . You may go . Come on , lad . A little exercise will do you good . One more ! Suck it up , babe ! Come on . Be tough ! I 'll turn you into a wrestler yet . Next time , I 'll get 200 out of you . - I did the best I could ! - Everybody get in the shower . - Oh , ho ! - That wasn 't cool . It 's okay . Come on , man . Not you , Culp . You stay behind . Anybody ever tell you you got a bad attitude , boy ? - You wrestled in prison ? - Not by choice , Coach . I wrestled in the service . Oh , yeah ? Which one ? Military . - Oh ! - That 's it , the military . Ah , you gotta lay off the steroids , Coach . I hear they shrink your penis . I 'm a firm believer in negative reinforcement , Culp . You better be careful from now on , Culp . You macho motherfucker , right , man ? Beat the shit out of the kids ? Get away from him . Oh my God . Amazing . Simply amazing . Play that back . That was a level seven , multidimensional decision . The intelligence factor is evolving . It isn 't artificial any longer . Kill the enemy ? I mean , don 't you think you went a bit too far ? The boy had a gun , for God 's sake . He had to defend himself . The program may be evolving faster than we thought . Or they 're having trouble absorbing the educational directives . They are machines , you idiot . They absorb whatever we put into them . Correct ? Hopefully . There 's nothing to worry about , Marv . They 're just learning . Jesus . I hate to see what they 'd do if you tried to help an old lady cross the street . Oh , come on . I just wanted to thank you for helping me this morning . Tell it to your dad . Would you give me ... Quit thinking about yourself . I just saw one of my best friends die . Mohawk pulled a gun on him . What was he supposed to do ? I was there . Mohawk was so wasted , he wouldn 't have known which end the bullets come out . The study of history is ... is rewarding , not only in its wonderful richness , but also in the lessons that can be gleaned from it . So let 's turn our attention to the Trojan War . You 're late . Sit down . Sit . He 's wasted . Sonny , please sit down . Please ? Did you get a note from the principal ? No . But I 'd be happy to take some time off to get you one . Watch out . D. 385 , huh ? Huh ? That 's yours . But lockers are private property . Tsk tsk tsk tsk . Drug dealing is a capital offense . It 's all personal , man . L ... I gotta have it , okay ? I know . Not anymore , my son . Call Forrest . Get him in here now ! He 's going berserk . Jesus . As you 'll recall , the salient point in the story of Achilles and his famous heel is that the basis of all military strategy is ... find the weak spot and attack . Does anyone have an explanation ? Ingestion of 8,000mg of ethyl degimesythal will do that . Break the boy 's neck ? Pulverize his jaw ? The effects of habitual use are indeed disturbing . Mr. Hardin , you beat that boy . Only in self-defense , Miles . The filthy little punk was armed with a dangerous weapon . And he was out of control on narcotics . Ethyl degimesythal is notorious for producing acts of superhuman strength . Mr. Langford ? The news crew is here . Thank you , Wendy . You 'll have to excuse me . I have statements to make , people to placate . Dr. Forrest ? We 'll discuss this later ... alone . Of course , Miles . Whatever you say . - Hi , Daddy . - Hello , sweetie . What are you doing here ? Uh , Cody wanted me to come up and talk to you . Hmm ? He thinks that Mr. Hardin might have something to do with Sonny 's death . Does he ? That poor boy had a drug problem . He died of an overdose . Now it 's very important to me that you don 't get too involved in all this . You have to set an example . Remember whose daughter you are . - Hmm ? - Excuse me , Mr. Langford , but the news crew is getting impatient . All right , Wendy , I 'll be right through . - Here , give me a hug . I gotta go . - Okay . - I 'll see you later . - All right . See you for dinner . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting . Miles Langford . - Come on through to my office . - Thank you . There . You see ? It was an OD . All I see is that your father doesn 't give a shit about the truth which is that those teachers are killing people , Christie . You just have a problem with authority figures . Jesus ! You really are the principal 's daughter , aren 't you ? If you just opened up those suburban eyes , you 'd see what 's going on . Hey . I don 't have to take this shit from some illiterate gangbanger , okay ? Go ahead , Miles . Have another if it makes you feel any better . All I wanted was a safe place for these kids to learn in . Hey , right now you 've got discipline for the students and security for the schools . Students are being beaten for minor infractions . Two are already dead . Tell me , how am I supposed to live with that ? I can tell you one thing : That is that this afternoon , you participated in a coverup of the drug-addict boy 's death . Miles , I strongly suggest that you let this program run its course . Soon every school in the country will be after us to handle their discipline problems . Now that could be a very profitable situation . Profitable ? For whom ? For me . Or I should say , for Megatech . But don 't worry , Miles . You 'll be the man who gets all the glory , the notoriety , the cover of " Time . " Not you , Cody . Here 's your good-looking brother , Mr. Culp . Partying hard , I see . I 'm a Blackheart now , Cody . For real . Congratulations , Angel . Hey ! Hey , Cody ! We 're jumping him in tonight in honor of Sonny . Did you hear how it happened ? Yeah . He got a little careless on the Edge . Do you believe everything they tell you in school ? Of course ! We all want to get ahead . I think that history teacher , Mr. Hardin , he killed Sonny . Oh , why ? ' Cause he didn 't do his homework ? Man , you are so full of shit , your eyes are the color of ... Hey , man , what ... what color are his eyes ? Well , they sure aren 't Blackheart colors . You know what I think ? I think it 's time for Mr. Culp , Sr. Here to be terminated from the gang officially . Come on . We don 't have to . Listen , kid , you 're one of us . You 're not one of him . Any student who wishes to file criminal charges against another student may do so in Mr. Langford 's office between 1 : 00 and 2 : 00 PM . Hey , how you guys doing ? Hi . Sorry about yesterday . Jesus , Cody , what happened to you ? Nothing . Blackhearts gave me a little going-away party . Christie , listen , your dad 's lying . Maybe he doesn 't know what 's going on , but you can convince him . I 'm not convinced either . Well , what if I can prove to you that Hardin and Bryles are killing people ? Oh , now you think Bryles is in on it too ? Cody , have you been doing Edge ? I mean , these teachers ... they may be jerks and they may be strict but they do not go around killing people . Come with me over to Hardin 's house , okay ? I saw him with Sonny 's crucifix yesterday . - If I can find it ... - Now ? You mean cut class ? Yeah . You never cut class ? - Reach down the back of my pants . - What ? Come on , live dangerous . What is this ? The faculty address book ? Cody , how did you get this ? Just another one of my devious criminal acts . Look up Hardin 's address . Check out Bryles . This is really weird . Hardin and Bryles ... they have the same address . Yeah ? Hey , wait a minute . Miss Connors lives there too . Party . This is it . So what if someone 's looking out the window ? Just act like you belong here . It shouldn 't be too hard . Okay , Sonny 's crucifix was on a gold chain . I hope we can find it in the middle of this clutter . Talk about your Lean Cuisine . Gotta stay on top of those pesky squeaks . What is this ? How homey . Uh , I think this is Miss Connors ' room unless those guys are weirder than you thought . Definitely Miss Connors . I 've never been in a chemistry teacher 's room before , Cody , but speaking as a woman , this is really strange . I mean , women don 't buy one lacy bra . They get panties to match . They binge out . - Oh , yeah ? - Women ... well , they have lots of stuff . They have lots of personal stuff . We 're talking about a chemistry teacher . Yeah , but she 's still a woman . Oh , yeah . You see ? His mom gave him this . He would never give it up . Shit ! Come on . Ah , we 've been invaded . Run run ! Respect for private property is the foundation of a free society . Well , the best defense is a tough offense . The Langford girl 's crossed over . We 'll advise her father on suitable methods of discipline for her . But now let 's eliminate the bad influence corrupting her . Get off ! Run ! Go ! So failing to yield at an intersection ; exceeding the speed limit ... Not wearing a helmet or using proper hand signals . Time for a little driver 's ed ? I hate water . Nice day for a dive . Hey . Happy birthday . My birthday was three months ago . I know . Sorry I missed it . That 's okay . Mom forgot to pay the bill . Who 'd you want to call ? Christie . The principal 's daughter ? Man , you oughta think about your image . I don 't have anything to worry about . Wanna shoot some hoops ? If you 're sure it won 't mess up your image . Looks like we 'll have to requisition a new vehicle . What about the boy ? That boy presents a most interesting problem . I can take care of him right now . No , individual attacks are too inefficient for our purposes now . We need a new strategy . - Such as ? - Such as ... a little game . A war game , if you will . Yeah ! Angel ! Angel ! Reigning champ of the free-fire zone . Where ... where you going ? Homework . Join me . Could be fun . If you weren 't my brother , I 'd say you were totally fucked in the head . Other than that , you love me , right ? Right . Same here . Angel ! Angel ! Angel ! Angel ! Angel ! Angel ! Angel ! Angel ! Exhibition of gang colors is strictly forbidden . What do you want ? We want to educate you . We want to show you the ... the misguidedness of indulging in gang behavior . I want to kick his butt . - We 're coming to get you , kid ! - No ! Ha ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! What do you want ? What do you ... Help ! Help ! Sorry for whatever I did . No ! Ah , no ! No ! - Shh ! - Help me ! No ! - I thought you had him ? - Sorry . - Shit . - Is that pizza , man ? Hey , get the hell away from my car . What the fuck ? Am I late for night school , bitch ? Let 's go , pizza man . I 'm starving . Why 'd you send Noser , man ? That kid gets lost trying to find his dick . Get him out ! Help him ! Get those fucking Blackhearts ! Fun and Games phase one complete . Somebody help ! - What ? - Get the rope off his neck ! Get the fuckin ' rope off his neck ! Leave him alone . Leave him alone ! My God ! Angel . - Get a blanket ! - Get the blanket ! Somebody get a fuckin ' blanket ! Son of a bitch ! Damn it ! Damn it ! Check it out ! Check it out ! Fuckin ' A , we 'll be there ! Yeah , right , man ! I want them all ! Jump me in ! Jump me fuckin ' in now ! Check everyone . Yeah , check nine again . - What about Forrest ? - He 's on his way . Why the panic , gentlemen ? The teachers are not in their rooms , sir . They can 't be monitored when they 're not here . There 's nothing to worry about , Marvin . They made the decision not to teach today , that 's all . But they 're supposed to do what they 're programmed to do , sir . Nothing more . But with the reasoning powers of a human being . Find them , shut them down and run a complete test . No matter how perfect they are in the field , Dr. Forrest , there 's no such thing as a completely stable hybrid . Or a completely stable human being . I don 't want them taken out of the field right now and that 's an order . Do you understand ? We 've almost made a complete emotional crossover to human mode . Worst-case scenario , sir ? The educational directives may have miscarried . They might be reverting back to their original military form . You let me worry about that , all right , Spence ? All right , everybody spread out ! Cover each other ! Medina , aqui rápido ! Down ! Down ! Get every one of them . Use any and all strategies to achieve our objective . Death to the opposition . - Exterminate the enemy ? - precisely . Connors and I will take out the Razorheads . Bryles , you will take out the Blackhearts . Take no prisoners . Vamos ! Come on ! Razorheads ! Hey , we got a couple of guys down ! Come on , go ! - Holy shit ! - All right ! Damn , let 's go ! Here they come . Ow ! Come on ! Vamos ! Hey , Hector ! - Go back around the other way . - I 'll get ' em . Cody ! You 're next , Mr. Culp . You 're making me very ... angry , Cody . What are you ? Let 's ride ! Move it ! Culp got away . That means this operation is a failure . No no . No , the strategy is sound . We 'll make him come to us . Did anyone else see anybody there last night besides the Razorheads ? Like who ? Like Mr. Hardin . You gotta quit fuckin ' around , Cody . I mean , the Razorheads , they killed your brother . You saw what they did to Reedy . No , I saw what Mr. Hardin did to Reedy . Why would a teacher want to get involved in a war between us and the ' Heads ? I wish I knew . Jeez , Cody ! Christie , those teachers , - they 're after me . - Of course ... I don 't know what the hell they are . Of course they 're after you . We broke into their house . Listen to me ! We just kicked the shit out of the Razorheads and Hardin was there . I saw him . I shot him . He didn 't even go down . Are you sure about this ? Yes , I 'm sure about this ! They 're worse than the Razorheads . They cannot be human beings ! They 're teaching at our school , Christie . Your dad 's got to do something . On your word ? Don 't even think about it . He 's fully on the warpath for you . Daddy got a call from Mr. Hardin about us being over there . He so much as sees me with you , I am going back to Nixon and you are going back to jail . That 's bullshit . You know , you people have had total freedom . That doesn 't give you a license to murder . Miles , you petitioned for Kennedy High School to be used as an experiment in disciplinary education . Yes , but not to use my school as a war zone . We had a new product to market and this was a perfect place to test it in . But these androids were supposed to educate the students . Battledroids , Miles . Battledroids . Military surplus marked to be shipped to Central America for the 10-Year War . That is until the D.E.D. Called . It seemed they were having a little problem in our schools . I said , " No problem , all we have to do is marry our war machine with the basic educational model . " Wonderful results . You should have seen those Washington assholes . They were amazed . And now we 've got a military contract worth billions . I see . So they 've been waging war with my students ? Isn 't that what all teachers do ? But my people aren 't just fighting , Miles ... they 're winning . Whatever happened to education ? The students can learn if they want to . They simply have to make the right choice . Sure ... learn or be killed . I want you to turn them off . I 'm terminating this program ! I 'm afraid that 's the bad news , Milesy . You see , once this program has been implemented , I 'm afraid it can 't be turned off . The bottom line is " Kill the enemy . " What ... what ... Hello ? Ah , yeah . I know . Oh , I 'll be there , Cody . Don 't you worry your pretty little head . I 'll be there . What is it , man ? I remember the only way I could get Cody Culp into school was to promise him free drugs . Now he wants to die there . What 's going on ? He called me up . One on one . You trust him ? Yeah , like a vampire giving me a blowjob . Daddy ? Is that you ? Daddy ? Hello ? It ain 't Daddy , honey . What are you doing here ? It 's 10 : 00 PM . Do you know where your boyfriend is ? Where 's my ... my father ? Get Cody Culp on the phone , or your father 's a dead man . Do you understand ? Huh ? Hello ? Hey , man , it 's your old lady . She 's in some kind of trouble . - Christie ? - Got your bitch right here , man . And if you ever want to see her again , show up at the school in an hour . If you don 't , she 's mine . The Razorheads have her . Hector just called me out to the school . That 's good . That 's good . Does that mean you 're with us ? - Yeah , let 's go . - All right ! Great . Jesus Christ , what is it with that guy ? Don 't we spend enough time in school as it is ? That 's it . You see ? Why would Hector stay at school if he didn 't have to ? Jesus , it 's the teachers . - Shit ! - Everybody get in here ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Razorheads ! - Let 's ride ! Here all by yourself ? I 'm disappointed in you , Cody . I must say , I thought you 'd exercise more caution . Don 't worry about me , Hector . Let 's do it . You called me out . Wrong , Hector . You see , someone 's running a game on us , the same game that killed my brother , the same game that killed Noser . You killed Noser ! I didn 't kill anyone . And I 'm not here to fight you . You got no choice . - Back me up , Curt . - No no no no , jefe . No one 's gonna back you up . The mind is a precious thing to waste , Cody . Don 't make me waste yours . Inside this school are three inhuman teaching monsters . One 's running this game . They kidnapped my girl . They killed Sonny , Reedy , Mohawk and Noser . And Angel . I can 't believe you . You 're fuckin ' talking shit about your own brother . Sonny was an Edgehead , man . He OD 'd . One of these teachers killed him and took this . It 's got his blood all over it . You gotta know who your real enemies are . Now I 'm going in there to waste some teachers . - Are you with me ? - I 'm with you ! - Could be fun . - Yeah ! But if they 're not in there , the war 's back on . Do it . There 's only one rule ! Christie 's in here somewhere . If anybody finds her , make sure she doesn 't get hurt . Very romantic , Cody . Now be careful . These things are like a bad , fucked-up , George-Jetson nightmare ! Move out ! Go that way ! Oye , Flavio , take a couple Razorheads , go up to the library . I hear they got the new Anne Batey novel . No shit ! Been wanting to read that . - Who 's got a library card ? - I got library card ! Move out ! Go that way ! Okay , man . I remember in junior high , man , you kicked ass . Yeah , I thought you were pretty bad yourself , ese . Let 's go show Miss Connors exactly what we 've learned . Ave Maria , how we Latins supposed to learn English if the teachers don 't show up in class ? Just shut up and keep moving . We gotta find Christie . Here I am , boys . Shoot her ! Shoot her again ! Die , you fucking bitch . Ha ha ha ha ! Let 's get the hell out of here ! You 're gonna need more than that , boys . Tiene bionic tetas ! Go ! Ha ha ! - Come on , go ! - What the fuck ? Cono ! Esa puta 'st ? caliente ! Go go ! Get out of here ! That bitch ... she ain 't even fuckin ' real . How are we supposed to deal with that ? Go ! Move it , move it ! I gotta find Christie . Can you handle Bryles by yourself ? Yeah , I can keep his ass running , but what about Miss flick-my-dick ? - I 'll take care of her . - Don 't get your balls burned off . Christie . Shit . Hey , man ! Hey , it 's just me . - Just keep watch . - All right . Hide your face . Shhh . All right . It 's okay . It 's okay . Shh , stop crying . Come on , it 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay . It 's all right . Curt ! Curt ! Wanna rumble ? Come on ! Come on . You come ... come on ! Run ! - Run ! - I 'm still coming . Help ! Help ! I love to mold young minds . You son of a bitch ! God damn you ! You 're a good fighter , Cody , but you 're defeated . Cody ! - Help ! - It 's important to know when to surrender . You 're history , Mr. Hardin . Ohhhh ! Oh , man . Christie . Cody ! Get back . Daddy ! Come on . We 'll come back . Come on . We 'll come back . Shit ! Come on , hurry up ! Run , run ! All right , turn on all the gas . Right here , you mechanical bitch ! I guess I blew that course . - Hey ! Where 's Connors ? - Oh , shit ! She 's toast . Come on ! I got an idea . Can you buy me some time ? No problem . He 's dying to stick one of those missiles up my ass . Let 's go ! All right , keep him busy . Hey , Bryles ! Here , man ! Bryles , I 'm over here ! Over here ! Hold on ! Jump ! This is some heavy gangbanging going on , hey ? You okay ? - Yeah . - All right ? Aw , let 's go check out our homeboys , see if anybody 's left . Okay . All right . Cody , you hear that ? It 's one of our bikes . Come on . What are you , a cop ? Bob Forrest , Department of Educational Defense . So you 're the humanitarian that decided to bring these teachers here . That 's right . A billion-dollar operation . Well , tough shit , Bobby . You can use what 's left of them for garbage cans . Everything was fine , just fine . This was going to be the future of education . It would have eliminated dirty little insects like you , made me a lot of money . But now all I have left is my reputation as an upstanding citizen . And that I intend to keep , which means , of course , none of you can survive . That was foolish ... very foolish . When will you learn that aggression is not that answer ? I 'm afraid you 're next , my son . Cody ! Oh , God , help ! No ! Cody ! Put the chain around his neck ! Go ! Have a nice stretch , Coach ? It 's okay . It 's over . It 's all over . I feel the shadows on me now With so much more to see I see the strange arrival From 1,000 miles away If I stopped Right where I stand And believed the lines on my hand I would open up my fist And take the things I 've missed Come the day I will be there when the hammer starts to fall Come the day I will be there with my reasons for it all Struck by sound across my face Loud enough that I can taste Knock the choices from my head Hear the voice in which I said Come the day I weave around the dangers The finest threads unwind This net between my fingers Covers all I 've left behind If I stopped Right where I stand And believed the lines on my hand I would open up my heart And take the hardest part Come the day I will be there when the hammer starts to fall Come the day I will be there with my reasons for it all Struck by sound across my face Loud enough that I can taste Knock the choices from my head Hear the voice in which I said Come the day , oh When the hammer starts to fall I will be there when you call Come the day I will be there when the hammer starts to fall Come the day I will be there with my reasons for it all Struck by sound across my face Loud enough that I can taste Knock the choices from my head Hear the voice in which I said Come the day , oh I feel the shadows on me now With so much more to say I see the strange arrival From 1,000 miles away If I stopped Right where I stand And believed the lines on my hand I would open up my fist And take the things I 've missed Come the day I will be there when the hammer starts to fall Come the day I will be there with my reasons for it all Struck by sound across my face Loud enough that I can taste Knock the choices from my head Hear the voice in which I said Come the day , oh Come the day I will be there when the hammer starts to fall Come the day I will be there with my reasons for it all Struck by sound across my face Loud enough that I can taste Knock the choices from my head Hear the voice in which I said Come the day , oh Come the day Come the day Struck by sound across my face Loud enough that I can taste Knock the choices from my head Hear the voice in which I said Come the day .

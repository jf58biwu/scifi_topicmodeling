Oh , Lexy poo . Close your eyes . Are they closed ? Ta-da ! How do I look ? Answer me . You look marvelous , darling . Oh , Lex , you 're just saying that . Classiest star in the whole face of the Earth . Oh , Lexy , poo . You , bug eyed creep , it 's my birthday ! You forgot , didn 't you ? After everything I 've done . One lousy day of the year isn 't asking too much . I 've done your socks , wash your underwear cut off the letters for your ransom notes . Feed your fat face day in and day out . Hiding in this dump like a cockroach . How I might as well be dead . Now this is it , skin head . If you don 't take me out right now , tonight it 's over . Lex , look at me . You look at me ! If you don 't put that down right now .. ... and look at me .. ... I 'll kill myself . Lex . Three and a half months .. ... I 've been working on this a .. ... a formula that could increase my mental powers exponentially . Three and a half months . - And you just destroyed it . - Good . I suppose mega-mental power doesn 't mean much to a flee brain twit like you because you 've got the mind of an amoeba . But it means a lot to me . So , go on , kill yourself . You 'll be doing us , both a favor ! [ intense music ] [ glass shattering ] [ coughing ] [ screaming ] No ! Darla ? Darla ? Are-are you okay ? That 's wrong . What ? You killing a peptide bonds . Huh ? You structurals are okay but you 're never gonna generate any deoxide ribules if you keep breaking down your pyrimidines , dehydration synthesis doesn 't work like that . Dumbo . Oh my God , it worked . What 's the square root of eight seven million nine hundred and forty six thousand eight hundred and eight four ? 9378 . This is getting tedious . Now , you 're just jealous . Dummy . Well , if you 're so smart why don 't you put it to use ? Why don 't you plan something ? - Like what ? - Oh , I don 't know . A bank job . Another bank job ? I 'd say , Lex , you have the imagination of a trout . I 'm the most brilliant criminal genius in human history . I need to make a debut . Global debut . - What do you have in mind ? - Something . Spectacular . [ phone dial tone ] ( man on radio ) This is a WCXP news flash . The financial record of the entire international banking system have been scrambled by a mysterious computer virus . The unknown hacker sent a ransom note demanding 100 million dollars to restore the system It 's signed the bird of paradise . - Wonder what that .. - This is WXCP news flash . Clark ? This is nuts . How we gonna escape ? We 'll worry about that later . - Don 't you have a plan ? - Trust me . You maybe a genius but this 's really pushing the- - Shut up and do what you 're told , dumbo . - We have an appointment . - Wait a minute . The Bird of paradise , I presume . Bingo . An apt description . Oh . You like what you see . Perhaps , had we met under a happier circumstances . It 's all here . This should solve your little problem . Much thanks . Oh , before you rush off I 'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine . Right on schedule . - You expected this ? - Button it . Hey there , big fella . - Long time no mumbo jumbo . - Oh , God . Tell me , Luthor . Did you really think that you can get away with this ? I 'm taking you in . Oh , wouldn 't you rather take me out ? I never let a guy touch me in the first date . - What 's going on ? - It 's simple . Whatever I think , umm , happens . Psychokinesis , that 's impossible . - The formula was- - - All this and brains too . What you gawking at , handsome ? Darla , what are you after ? Fly me to the moon . You are kidding . Well , I am woman , you are man . You are pathetic . You may be dangerous , you may be powerful . But you 're still a bad joke . How dare you . I have the mental power of a whole computer bank . I can move things with my mind . My I.Q. is off the scale . And not only that .. I 'm pretty . Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder . [ intense music ] Darla , you should learn to control your emotions . You want control ? What this . No , wait . Wait-wait a minute . What-what ? No , no . What are you doing ? Get me down . Pull me back , get me out . What is she doing ? Wo , no . No , oh , no . Yeah , that 's it . That 's better . - Ah . - Better , easy . Easy now , easy now . That 's it ? - Great . - Thanks . Right . [ instrumental music ] Darla , this is insane . If I take his girl friend out , Superboy will wise up . What the devil you want with Superboy ? Oh , great , she 's got Kent with her . Let 's forget it . Oh , what 's the matter ? You 're scared of him ? Oh , please . - Your coming with us . - Not this again . Do you realize that kidnapping is a violation of- - Don 't make me mad . I 'm giving Superboy 24 hours to meet me on my turf and on my terms . Or you both history . - We 're taking both of them ? - The more the merrier . Lick this . You better pray that he shows . Now get moving . [ humming ] [ humming continues ] [ instrumental music ] And then she drank it ? Every last drop . So what happened next ? She turned in to a very intelligent monster . Sort of a cross between Raquel Welch and Godzilla . - Can you change her back ? - Sure . All I have to do is replicate what happened in that beaker . And then mix an antidote to the serum . It ought to be easy with a super computer in about three years . Uh , excuse me . I know someone that might help to speed the process . Yeah , sure . He-he wears a red cape ? You don 't actually exp- - [ thunder rumbling ] I 'd think about it . When hell freezes over . ( Darla ) Think about what ? [ intense music ] Oh . Nothing . When the cat 's away .. What are you doing , Lex ? Uh , well , you know . Doodles . Darla ! Darla , you broke .. Darla . Oh , no , please . I wasn 't doing anything ! I wasn 't doing anything . I 'm what you made me , Lex . Don 't even think about undoing it . There 's no way back . [ sparking ] But apparently Superboy likes to keep his dates waiting . Well , if he doesn 't show up soon I 'm afraid I 'll have some .. ... very unhappy guests . The storm is the earthquake . She 's causing them , isn 't she ? That 's the least of it . She 's growing more powerful by the second . We maybe headed for a global holocaust . Well , if you let us go . I can reach Superboy and arrange a meeting . There 's a lab at the bureau , right ? You tell Superboy to meet me there in an hour . - Let Lana go too . - She stays . It 's the only way . Go ! No , wait . Hit me . - What ? - Gotta look like you escaped . Now , hit me . - I don 't know . - Oh , come on . [ laughing ] You really are a wimp , aren 't you ? Can 't you put a little muscle into it ? [ intense music ] Well , if you say so . I got the latest science readings . Darla is over charging the Earth 's magnetic field . Looks like things are getting worse . Icebergs in the L.A harbor . Eskimos with heat prostration . - It 's definitely getting worse . - Let me see that . [ beeping ] Professor Peterson ! I gotta go . It 's quite a shiner . It 's nothing . Who did it ? I ran into a door , okay . The whole earth is about to go out of orbit . So can we just focus here ? We got to identify the exact amount of enzyme that was released into the solution when Darla grabbed my arm and knocked that dropper into the beaker . Now , we 're talking trial and error . Unless we get lucky . We 'll have to run the experiment several thousand times . I can do that in few minutes . - A few minutes ? - Hyper speed . Ah . Well , once we got the formula I can whip up the antidote . And how you gonna test it ? Unless you want to volunteer , I suggest we feed it to a rat . Fine . Can you handle the taste ? Let 's just get started . [ instrumental music ] I don 't get it . He was down to 22 seconds and now he 's just sitting there . ( Lex ) He 's reading . I 'll mix the anitdote . [ thundering ] The head geophysicist is predicting that the Earth is gonna flip off its axis . In 38 minutes . Oh , my god . I sure hope she 's thirsty . [ intense music ] I didn 't want any of this . I didn 't plan to hurt anybody . And I certainly wasn 't trying to steal your guy . It 's just .. Darla .. You need help because Superboy can do something about this . Superboy doesn 't understand me anymore than Lex does . [ rumbling ] I just wish .. I just wish that Lex wouldn 't .. You 're free to go . Darla . I 'm not gonna leave you like this . ( Lex ) Greetings . Wo ! It 's a regular monsoon out there . - Where have you been ? - I tried to track down Clark . You know . A funny thing happened on the way to the library . This guy comes up to me . And he asked me for a light . Ha ha , blood of the wine . You know , it 's kind of funny because I don 't smoke . I used to but I quit . I don 't even miss it . Well , I suppose I could use one right now . ( Lex ) Have you ever seen photos of smoker 's lungs ? Black and charred . Strange .. ... passive growths . Here , honey . Drink up . Your hand is shaking . Oh , well , I-I probably caught a chill , the rain , you know . Or is it poison ? Or the antidote ? Antidote for what ? Don 't insult my intelligence . You 've been working with Superboy . - Superboy ? - He 's coming , isn 't he ? No , what makes you think that .. Real clever , Lex . - Darla , you have to drink it . - Why should I ? - You have a minute left . - Before what ? Before your psychokinetic powers destroy the whole world . So ? [ rumbling ] And Darla . What do you want ? All I ever wanted was a little affection . Maybe a little respect . Will destroying the world get it for you ? Believe me . I would drink it if I could . Well , here . Darla , come on , drop the shield . - I can 't . - What do you mean you can 't ? I can 't control it . - It 's involuntary . - A defense mechanism . [ whispering ] - What ? - Try it . Oh , God , geez Gosh , honey , I 'm a really .. I 'm really sorry about all the stuff that I .. I mean , what I 'm .. [ instrumental music ] I love you . What did you say ? I love you . Really . Here , honey . Let me help you . Here . [ intense music ] What 's going on ? What 's everybody looking at ? A very brave woman . - Huh ? - A very smart lady . Who me ? Classiest doll in the face of the Earth . Aww . Lexy poo . [ theme music ]

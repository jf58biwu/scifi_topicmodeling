 Hold , punster ! Find the prisoner ! Find the prisoner ! There , there . Whoa ! Who 's this ? There 's been a mistake . Get me a lawyer . Forward , punster . Where is the king ? In the great hall , sire . Enough . To thy post . Aye , sire . " Ode to the Great Hawk . " It can 't be . No ! No ! Not again ! Hello , Duane . Nice to see you . Nice to see you too , Doc . How are you feeling today ? Pretty good . Why don 't we sit down , Duane ? I want to go over a few things with you . Okay . Now , uh , it says here that you 've been refusing to take your medicine . I don 't like the way it makes me feel . Okay . All right . Let 's talk about that . Because we give you that medicine for a reason , Duane- - because of your behavior . I know , I know . Because we don 't want you to hurt anybody again . You 're still hearing voices ? I 'm not crazy , Doc . Duane Barry 's not like these other guys . No . Everybody here is different . They 're coming again . They 're coming again , I can feel it . They 're going to take Duane Barry to the place . Nobody 's coming , Duane . Nobody can stop them . I 'm going to give you a shot . I think you just need some rest . Now , this will make you sleep . And when you wake up , you 'll that we didn 't let anybody hurt you . Okay , Duane ? Duane ? Duane ! Get away . Get away . Put down the gun , Duane . Give me the keys . Duane ... Give me the damn keys ! No ! No ! Either way , Doc , we 're getting out of here together . You guys ... let 's go now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Agent Mulder . Krycek , what 's up ? There 's a situation going down . They want you out there right away . What kind of situation ? Hostage negotiation . And they want me ? Yeah . What for ? The guy escaped a mental institution . He 's got four people at gunpoint in an office building . Claims he 's being controlled by aliens . Stay back behind the barrier ! Stay back ! Krycek , Mulder , FBI . Right that way , sir . Yes , sir . Okay , I 've got it right here in front of me . Lucy ? - Agent Mulder ? - Yeah . Lucy Kazdin , negotiation commander . - Thanks for coming . - This is Agent Krycek . Let me show you what we 've got . His name 's Duane Barry . He 's armed with a nine-millimeter Smith Wesson handgun , one nine-round magazine . It is our belief that he 's prepared to use the gun and not afraid to die . What does he want ? Safe passage for himself and his original hostage- - a shrink named Hakkie . Passage to where ? He 's bent on taking the doctor with him to an alien abduction site , only he can 't quite remember where the site is , so he stopped at a travel agency . Is he lucid ? Yes , but he 's off his medication , so he 's manic . Ranting about scoot-mark scars on his body , homing devices and a lot of other nonsense . - Like what ? - This whole alien abduction business , which I guess you know something about . Yeah , yeah , but I 've never been in a hostage negotiation before . Oh , we 'll take you through it . Agent Rich is our advisory commander . He and I will be coaching you . What Mr. Barry needs right now is a friend- - someone who appears to understand him and can appeal to his sense of reason . Do we know anything about his abduction experiences ? You really believe in this stuff , Agent Mulder ? Is that a problem ? We 're here to save lives . You 'll begin negotiations immediately . Every three hours , we 'll reevaluate your progress and let our tactical commander advise and update on the use of force . If this man is an abductee , I need to know more about him- - his personal history . Each abduction case is different . That material 's not been made available to us . Nobody 's thought to call the hospital for records ? Look , Agent Mulder , the guy 's a psycho . Your object is to keep him on the phone . The longer you do , the more chance he 's not going to kill anybody . We stop to do a Freudian analysis , next thing we know , we 've got four dead hostages . So whatever crap you 've got to make up about spacemen or UFOs , just keep him on the phone . Are we going to have to sit on the floor like this all night ? I told you to shut up . We all have families , for God 's sake . Duane , don 't hurt anyone . Please ? I 'm not going to hurt you , Doc because this time , you 're going with Duane Barry so you can see what it 's like ... that it 's real ! Duane ? Yeah ? This is Special Agent Fox Mulder . Look , I want to try to help you . Yeah ? Well ... we 're just sitting here waiting for , uh , travel plans . I think I know what you 're going through , Duane . I just want to make sure you get what you want and that Bob , Kimberly , Gwen and Dr. Hakkie don 't get hurt . You know what I 'm going through ? You think you know what Duane Barry 's going through ? ! You don 't know jack ! I know you 're scared , Duane , and that you 'd like to see this all come out right . Yeah , right ... so they can put me back in the nuthouse ... where I belong . We 're only concerned about your safety , Duane- - you and the others . Hey ... what 's your name- - Mulder ? I know the routine . Honesty , containment ... conciliation . Am I missing something ? You need someone to trust , Duane . I know a lot of people who have been through similar experiences . You want to do something for me , Agent Mulder ? You keep your dogs on a leash . You try to gas me out or do anything stupid , these people die . They 're not taking me again . You got it ? They can take somebody else ! Nobody 's going to try anything , Duane . Who is this guy ? He 's FBI , isn 't he ? Former FBI . And you didn 't think to mention that ? He 's been out of the Bureau since 1982 . Institutionalized on and off for over a decade . It 's beside the point . The point being that the Bureau wants to minimize its embarrassment . Isn 't that it- - that we can police our own ? They would like it done as neatly and cleanly as possible . Well , they 're off to a hell of a start . Negotiation is a process , Agent Mulder . Well , if you just wanted somebody to come down and read the script , you didn 't have to bring me out . This method has proven extremely successful in winning the hostage-taker 's trust . No , no . That man is afraid . And the only way you 're going to win his trust is by trying to understand what he 's afraid of . Have you ever spoken to an abductee , Agent Kazdin ? Heard them talk about having their brains sucked out through their nostril while being wide awake through the experience ? Would you like to know what they do to a woman 's ovaries ? Not particularly . Well , then understand that you might have to alter your approach a little bit here . Is there anything I can do ? Yeah . What 's your name again ? - Krycek . - Krycek . - Have you got your notepad ? - Yeah . Grande two percent cappuccino with vanilla . Agent Rich ? ... the hostages . As you can see , Carl , the SWAT team ... Scully . It 's me . I 'm in Virginia . Yeah , I know . I 've been watching it on TV . What 's going on out there ? What 's the media saying ? That an escaped mental patient is holding four people hostage in a travel agency . What they 're not telling you is that he 's former FBI who also claims to be an alien abductee . Seriously ? Yeah . His name is Duane Barry . Look , Scully , I need your help . Need you to find out what happened to him . Anything- - transcripts from therapy sessions , hypnotic regressions , anything about his abduction experience . Mulder ? The lights just went out here . What the hell is going on ? Tactical unit , what are you guys up to ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing , sir . Ah , what the ... ? Get down . Everybody , get down . Tactical command . Shots have been fired . Locate and report . Repeat- - locate and report . Negative . I 've lost communication ! Wait ! We 're on it , sir ! We 've lost our captured line . We have either four or five shots fired ! - What 's the number in there ? - 555-2804 . Repeat- - we have either four or five shots fired ! An electrical substation blew . - We 've got no power up and down the block . - Duane ? I told you . Is everyone all right , Duane ? You didn 't believe me , did you ? No , I-I believe you . I just need to know if anybody 's been shot . I need towels . Kimberly . Kimberly . He 's going to bleed to death . I guess we 're going to need a doctor . Now , you 'll have almost full ambient hearing loss in this ear . Your sense of balance may be affected slightly , particularly if you have to move quickly or get into a physical situation . If you get trapped or held in the building for some reason , we 'll be able to warn you if there 's a tactical assault . Now , remember , he 's either got four or five rounds left . Now , there 's a wireless mic hidden in the top of this flak jacket . Speaking in a normal tone of voice , we should be able to hear anything you say up to 100 yards . Make every attempt to keep these devices concealed . You put a normal telephone handset to that ear , it 'll cause feedback and reveal that you 're wired . - You really want to do this ? - Yeah . Your job will be to deliver medical help to the hostage . Anything else is just a bonus . You are to get in and get out . You are not to risk your own life . And whatever you believe ... Don 't jump into his delusion . I can 't negotiate with him if he thinks I believe him . Right . This is Agent Janus . He 's a trained medic . He 'll work on the hostage . You are to keep Duane Barry talking . Like I said , if he 's talking , he 's not going to shoot anybody , including you . Now , I 've got three snipers out there . Anything you can do to get him to the front door . All we need is one shot to the medulla oblongata . Tac command , this is rooftop zero-two . I have them in sight . They 're passing the fountain and approaching the front entrance now . Just unlock the door . Move back . - Duane ? - Hands in the air . Put the kit on the floor slowly . We 're unarmed . We just want to help the injured . Over here . Face the door . That 's right . Not armed , huh ? You 're FBI , aren 't you ? Got a gun in the kit ? No . Are you wearing a wire ? No . We 're just here to help . Okay . Nobody 's going to try anything , Duane . That 's right . Good . You want to work with him . We just want to make sure no one else gets hurt . Just do your business and get out . How 's he doing ? He 's bad . Hi . My name is Janus . I 'm a paramedic . Hold on . We 're going to take care of you . They want to work with you , Duane , but you got to work with them . Why not let the others go ? Doc 's going with me . Then let the women go . Were they here , Duane ? The light- - was that them ? Don 't try and BS Duane Barry . We lost time . I checked my watch . Isn 't that what happens- - time stops ? Isn 't it ? Duane ? You 're making it up . Isn 't that what they 've been saying to you , Duane ? That you 're making it up ? They say it 's all inside my head . All they want to do is just give me more drugs . I hear you , Duane . You hear me ' cause I got a gun . No . I believe your story . No . You 're feeding into his psychosis . I know you 're afraid . I know the pain and the fear you must feel . Just listen to me . Don 't try to identify with him . I 've talked to people , Duane . People just like you , who nobody wanted to believe . This man 's going to die unless we get him to a hospital . Why don 't you let him go , Duane ? There 's no reason this man has to die . Come on , Duane . You 've got the power . Let him go . Okay . Good . You made the right choice . Now we 're just going to move him carefully to the door . No . Baldy can go . But you stay . I 'm trading the bald man for you . Damn it ! You 're going to be all right , sir . Now let 's see how good a liar you are . I 'm telling the truth , Duane . How could you ever know what Duane Barry 's been through ? How could anyone know ? It happened to my sister . Don 't you think you can lie to save their lives . I want some honesty ! I want some respect ! I 'm tired of all the BS . How does it happen , Duane ? Driving in your car ? Alone in bed at night ? When do they come to you ? You 're paralyzed , aren 't you ? Unable to move . Sometimes you can 't even breathe . You feel an electric shock go through your body , and then they 're there . He 's going to push him right over the edge . I need a clear picture of what 's going on in there . Right away . You 're choosing a dangerous course , Agent Mulder . There are beings , aren 't there , Duane ? Are they tall or small ? - No ! No ! - Diminutive ? They take you , Duane , against your will . He 's gonna kill us . You 're powerless . Sometimes you can 't even speak . It 's always the same . Nobody can help you . Where do they take you , Duane ? Is there a ship ? Do they take you to a ship , Duane ? How do you get there ? Are you conscious of being transported ? They 're , uh ... they 're talking to Duane Barry . But they don 't speak . He can hear what they 're saying . They can ... read his mind . That 's right . Abductees call it mindscan . It 's a kind of telepathy . I 'm telling ' em I don 't want to go . But they never listen . They know what I 'm saying . But they just ... go right on about their business . Tell him what their business is . Tell him . They take you aboard the ship to perform the tests . They ... drilled my teeth . They drilled holes in my damn teeth ! Yeah ? Who here can talk to an Agent Scully ? Agent Scully , it 's Alex Krycek . Where 's Mulder ? He traded himself for one of the hostages . What ? ! He 's in with Duane Barry . You 've got to get him out of there . Well , they 're working on it . No , you 've got to get him out of there now or he 's going to be killed . How can you be sure ? Because Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is . How old was your sister when they took her ? She was eight . I 've seen kids sometimes , young girls . What are they doing to them ? Doing tests . You know ... testing them . I tell them not to cry . Are they hurting them ? Oh , yeah . Sometimes ... sometimes it hurts real bad and , uh ... you just want to die , you know ? You know what it 's like , sir ? It 's like living with a gun to your head and never knowing when it 's going to go off . You can let the others go , Duane . Let the others go and take me . Oh ... they heard you talking like that , they 're going to have your ass . I don 't care about that , Duane . No . I wouldn 't do that to you . Besides , Doc and I got an appointment . Ain 't that right , Doc ? ! We got a picture . Mulder is here , opposite the doctor . The women are on the north wall . We can 't see the east wall . - Duane Barry must be there . - Hold on a second . No , I don 't think you understand what I 'm telling you . I just flew down here from Washington ... - We 've got a situation in progress . - All right , well , then let me talk to someone who 's in charge . - You are . - Calm down , Scully . Don 't tell me to calm down . I 'm not going to calm down until I can talk to someone who will listen to what I 'm saying . What 's the problem here ? I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully , and I have information that is vital to your negotiations . What information ? I think there has been a critical misjudgment here . This man who claims to be under the control of aliens- - his ... his mental health history describes a rare state of psychosis . As you can see from his medical records , in 1982 , Duane Barry was shot in the line of duty , the bullet piercing his bilateral frontal lobes . Right . The injury left him nearly incapable of functioning in society . It effectively destroyed the moral center of his brain . Now , almost 100 years ago , there was a famous case- - a man named Gage had a blasting rod pierce the same region . And what effect did it have ? He became a pathological liar , suffering from severe delusions . His behavior was characterized as bizarre and violent with a tendency to act out his fantasies . How did you get involved in this case ? Agent Mulder called me . We used to work together . Well , if this is true , he 's got your former partner completely fooled . Is there a way that I can reach him with this information ? The government knows about it , you know . They 're even in on it sometimes . Right there in the room when they come . They work together with a , uh , secret , uh , corporation . Who in the government ? A man , the military . They 're all in it together . The government knows why they 're here , but they wouldn 't dare let the truth out . So they cooperate . You 're going to have to deal with resolving this situation , Duane , sooner or later . I 'm tired . There 's no other way out . You 've got to tell them what you want to do . I just want to go back to the place . What place ? Where it first started . Where they first came and got me . Where is that ? A mountain . We went , uh , up and up , ascending ... ascending to the stars . I 'm not going again . Mulder , it 's me . Listen to me . You cannot trust Duane Barry . He is a brain-damaged psychopath who took a bullet in the head . He is not what you think he is . What ? How do they find you each time ? Implants ... my gums , sinus cavities ... and my belly button- - tracking devices . Mulder , he could snap at any time . He has a history of irrational and violent behavior . Now , you have to work towards resolving this . Now , you have his trust . You have to try and negotiate with him . Why not let the women go , Duane ? They 'll deal with you if you let the women go . That 's good . That 's good , Mulder . Now , keep him talking . HRT is moving into position , and unless you can get him to free the hostages , they 're going to execute a tactical plan . The women are of no consequence to you . Let them go . It 's the right thing to do , Duane . Okay , but he stays . Go on . Get out of here . Get up . Go on . Get out of here . Go on . I 'm ... I just want to say that I believe you . The women are clear . I got him , standing , center room ... moving ... This is the countdown , Mulder . They 're coming at you . Position one ready . Coming at you , number one . We 're going to need transportation . What do you want , Duane ? A car ? I don 't know . Do you know where you want to go ? They 're going to tell me . Duane , you can 't leave here if you don 't know where you want to go . Duane ! - What ? - Come here . Hold your fire . You lost your line . There 's something I want to ask you . What ? You didn 't believe me . I had to earn your trust . Now there 's something I got to know . Are you making any of this up ? You , uh ... calling Duane Barry a liar now ? No . You think I make it all up ? ! No , I don 't . I 'm sorry . You 're sorry ? ! Duane , will you listen to me for a second ? You 're just like all the others , aren 't you ? - Duane . - You say you believe me . - Duane , I do believe you . - But you don 't . - I believe you ! No ! - You 're lying just like everybody else ! I believe you , Duane ! I trusted you ! I trusted you like a fool ! Can I say ... Can I ... Can I say something ? ! Duane , can I say something ? I know you 're tired , but there 's something you 've forgotten to do . When you let the women leave , you left the door unlocked . Go lock the door , Duane . Go lock the door . Go lock the door , Duane . Go lock it . They could get in here . Go lock the door . Agent Mulder ! Dr. Hakkie ! He 's down ! He 's down ! 1400 block , South Parker . Code three . Repeat- - code three . You okay , Mulder ? Yeah . Whatever you 're feeling , you did the right thing . Yeah , it 's just that , uh ... I believe him . Sometimes when you want to believe so badly , you end up ... looking too hard . Agent Mulder , thanks for coming . No . I was surprised to get your call . Yeah , well , as it turned out , whatever your impression of the way it was handled , I didn 't get to thank you for going out there and putting it on the line . What ? I don 't know . I guess I thought maybe you called me down here to chew me out . Oh . - How 's he doing ? - Duane ? They almost lost him , but he 's stabilized . They 've got him listed as critical still . I checked on his record with the Bureau . It was exemplary . His accident was something of a mystery . Shot by his own weapon in a drug stakeout , left for dead in the woods . He was never the same . Lost everything- - wife , kids , house ... The fine thread of sanity . I actually called you down here for another reason , Agent Mulder . Uh ... in the X-rays , the surgeon found several pieces of metal in his gums , in his sinus cavity and one in the abdomen . I had them checked- - I felt you 'd want to know- - and there were tiny drill holes in his left and right rear molars . A dentist who examined them said they could not have been done with any of the current equipment in use . Not without chipping or damaging the tooth . Anyway , I thought you ought to know . This could just be a piece of shrapnel . Duane Barry did a tour of duty in Vietnam . It was right where he said it would be , Scully . Along with the ones in his gums and sinus . And you think that this was implanted ? Well , if it was , that would mean Duane Barry is telling the truth . Or some version of the truth . Look , I 'll-I 'll take this down to ballistics . We can have this cleared up in a second . Let me just make a slight adjustment . What do you think ? Could be a shell casing or a small artillery fragment . The edges are dull , but it could have been white-hot when it entered the body . That would make sense . But look at this . What ? These small markings . See them here ? Mmm . Looks like some kind of a stamp . Like it 's been tooled or etched . Pretty fine work , too . This square we 're looking at is only ten microns across . Strange . $ 11.14 . Thank you . I 'll , uh , be right with you . I have to cash out my drawer . What happened ? Did you touch something ? Uh , I don 't know what happened . Hello . This is Fox Mulder . Leave a message , please . Mulder , it 's me . I just had something incredibly strange happen . This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry- - it has some kind of a code on it . I ran it through a scanner , and some kind of a serial number came up . What the hell is this thing , Mulder ? It 's almost as if ... it 's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him . Come on , will you ? ! Mulder ! Come on ! I need your help ! Mulder ! Mulder ! I made this !

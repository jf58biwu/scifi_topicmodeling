 Come on . This is ridiculous . What is the deal with these people ? KCBG . Who are you holding for ? Listen , I 've been trying to get ahold of Lori Tanner ... for the last ten minutes . I 'm sorry . She 's not picking up in her office right now . Yeah , well , tell her she just lost her story . Hold on . Maybe she 's somewhere else in the building . Let me try and locate her . Wrinkle-free dirt-repellent polyester ... Is this working for you so far ? Is trying to make a comeback from the disco decade . Edit bay one . Yeah , hold on a second . ... is finding new life among top clothing designers . Hi , this is Judy Sanders over at Emax . Oh , God , Judy ! Thanks for calling me back . It 's not my fault we 're stuck with this lightweight ... Shh ! It 's important . I didn 't expect to hear from you again . Look , I can sneak you into the lab tomorrow night ... if you 've still got that five hundred you promised . Yeah , yeah . I just have to make sure ... you can get me in to see the animals . I got to know exactly what 's being done to them . No problem . Why don 't you meet me at 8 : 30 at the north gate ? And don 't be late . I can 't afford to get in trouble . I 'll be there . Yes ! Yes ! Good morning , Mr. Perez . Buenas dias , Senor Perez . Buenas dias , Senor Perez . How are you , Mrs. Perez ? Como esta usted , Senora Perez ? Como esta usted , senora ? How are you , Miss Perez ? Como esta usted , Senorita Perez ? Como esta ... shut up ! - Hello , sir . - Hola , senor . Hola , senor . - Hello , madame . - Hola , senora . Hola , sen ... Ladies and gentlemen . I am pleased to meet you . Mucho gusto en conocerle . - Thank you . - Gracias . - Please . - Por favor . - Goodbye . - Adios . This is exactly the type of story I 've been looking for . What do you know about animal rights ? You have a parrot that can 't stand you . It 's topical . It 's hard-hitting . I think I can do something significant with it . Do an expose . Who knows what goes on in that place ? We 're already running late on the polyester segment . Polyester segment . Please , give me a break . Drip-dry suits . That 's real hard-core . Excuse me , but that 's what we get paid to do around here . How many times have we had this discussion ... about what we 'd do if we got a chance to cover a real story ? No , I 'm not going to let you do this to me again . You 've got to shoot this one for me , Annie . You 're the best . Why can 't we be like everybody else , huh ? It doesn 't make sense to shoot the whole story on spec . We should just sell everybody on the idea first . No ! Because they 'll just go and put somebody else on it . The only way we 're ever gonna get to do anything real here ... is if we just shoot the story and blow their socks off . I 'm doing this with or without you . Come on . Bring it up . What is the deal ? It 's 9 : 00 . What 's her name ... Judy ... said she 'd meet us here at 8 : 30 . Maybe we should just get out of here . There 's no answer . Damn it . What are you doing ? I 'm sneaking in . Lori . Lori ! Wait . Lori , wait for me . Did your wife fix me up with her sister yet or what ? On second thought , I don 't think that 's such a good idea . I found out she won 't be turning 18 for another 8 months . Hey , that 's perfect , man . If I was you , I 'd rewrite that personal ad . Oh , come on , man . I haven 't gotten a date from that personal ad . Hey , listen , I was taking a creative writing course ... one time in community college . I 'll help you with it on my off night . We 'll get together , we 'll rewrite the thing . Those things don 't work . I got one more inside we got to get . So , yeah , we 'll just get together , like , Wednesday night . What 's that smell ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Shoot it . Shoot it . OK . I don 't eat doughnuts all day . I eat doughnuts in the evening . I eat candy bars in the morning . Listen , you should try driving with this shit in your trunk . You ever get a whiff of this shit ? It stinks . I 'll buy you some air freshener . How do you like that ? This must be the place . Got everything ? Have I ever forgotten anything before ? Let 's do it . Oh , my God . Look at this . Look at this . Annie , tape the rabbit . Got it , got it , got it . Hey , pan down the row . Look . They took her ear off . Move in on this one . This one . Look at the size of this wound . Now pull back and get the name of this monkey . OK , stay out of the shot . These people are sick . Look . Look at her head . And the tattoo on her face , too . This is unbelievable . - Bring your camera up here . - Hold on , I 'm coming . Look at this place . Look at this place . We 've got to get this whole shot of the whole place . I want people to really see what 's going on in here . What kind of person could do all this ? - Fifty-five , dude . - Yeah , yeah . Did he take everything , Manning ? Yes , sir , Dr. Jarret . Meet me around back . I got some specimens ... I want you to help me take up to the lab . Damn . I 'm not so sure about this . Oh , no . Look at this . Do we have enough light to tape in here ? Yeah , it 's good . I can 't believe they 're experimenting ... on endangered species like these . This is really strange . I 'm not even sure if this is legal . Annie , Annie , look at the bear . Come on , come on . What are you waiting for ? Be there in a second , doctor . Get the other cage . Get these doors here open . This is a major piece . We have got a real story . This is going to work . Lori . What 's in here ? Did you see what was in here ? Let 's just get out of here . Here we have a rare , extinct ... dog . Let me get that for you , doctor . Take these and put them in the lab . Thank you . What are they doing to you , huh ? I don 't think you should be doing that . I want to check him out . He 's not going to do anything . Hey , what are they doing to you around here , huh ? Poor little guy . Don 't you look at me . I didn 't put you in there . You were probably a lawyer in another life , I bet . What is this thing they have on him ? What is this ? What are these wires ? Your rooms are ready . Wake-up call 's at 6 : 00 . You can check in , but you can 't check out . - Do you have us both in frame ? - Yeah , why ? I want to do the intro to the story . Are you crazy ? We can do that later . No , it 's perfect now . Now . Do I look OK ? - You look beautiful . Hurry up . - Dog slobber ! Rolling . Is this dog really a noble sacrifice ... donating his life for the betterment of mankind ... or is he simply an innocent victim ... of the billion-dollar vivisection industry ? Shit . Shit . Doggie ! Max ! Max ! Get back here . - Max ! - Where did he go ? Max ? Hey ! Hey , hold it right there ! Hey , hold it ! Hold it right there ! Stop ! Shit ! - Hurry ! - I 'm trying ! Go ! Go ! - Jesus ! - Shit ! What the hell are you doing here ? Max . What 's going on ? What are you doing out ? Sit . Max . Halt , Max . Good boy . Good boy . Max , you 're scaring me . I 'm not angry with you . I 'm just tired . Max ... final command . Enter . Enter . Max ... Max . Now . Max ! Max ! God damn it ! - Where 's the car ? - Over there . Come on , come on ! What are you waiting for ? Let 's go ! Just get in ! Just get in the car . You don 't know what you 're doing ! Get in ! Forget the dog ! Max ! No ! Oh , man ! Oh , man ! Sucker ! Max ! No ! Max ! Max ! You said they had a video camera . Any idea why ? About six months ago ... there was a group of animal rights fanatics ... protesting outside the lab . I called the police . A couple of ' em tried to break in . Maybe that 's the connection . Emilio , why don 't you see if we booked anyone ? Nah , nah , nah , nah . The police did nothing . Exactly what kind of work do you do here ? I do genetic research ... often using animal models . You talking about vivisection ? Yes , I am . Vivi what ? Vivisection ... those cruel experiments they do on animals ... to test out new products . My girlfriend talks about it all the time . She wants to make sure things like the shampoo I use ... are on a cruelty-free products list . Well , your girlfriend is rather ignorant ... like most of these animal rights people . You try telling her that . Look . The kind of research I do here ... is about saving lives , human lives . That 's what 's important , isn 't it ? I don 't make eyeliner here ... and I don 't pour acid into monkeys ' eyes ... or stitch them closed , either . We get the picture , doc . We 'll be in touch . Yeah . I want Max back . We 're not talking about a street mutt here . We are talking about ... a million-dollar research animal . Well , for that kind of money ... he should be able to find his own way home . I 'm sure not sending him back there . You saw that dumpster . I 'm sure not sending him back there . You saw that dumpster . Yeah , but what are you going to do with him in the meantime ? I don 't know . Guess I 'll take him home . Find another place for him . Your boyfriend is gonna freak out ... when he finds out where you got him . Oh , yeah , right . Perry ? Perry won 't even notice him . Give me your purse ! Give it to me ! You , too , bitch ! Gimme the watch ! OK , OK ! Let her go . What else you got ? Come on , what else you got ? Nothing , nothing , nothing . - Oh , God . - Don 't do that ! You got any jewelry ? You want to watch me , mutt ? Woof ! Oh , shit ! Get that mutt away from me ! - Get him ! Get him ! - Yeah ! Yeah ! Shit ! - Jerk . - Are you OK ? Son of a bitch . Look at that . Oh , God . Max , how ... What did you do , Max ? Max . Hey ... My God . Is this dog incredible or what ? Oh , boy . Someone 's hungry , aren 't they ? Yeah . This stuff smells so disgusting . Wait till he goes to the bathroom . I want to see something . Would you sit ? Good boy ! Down . Oh , that 's a good boy . Good boy . I 'm a natural at this . He 's a good boy . Come here . You just need to have a little scratch . OK , get a really good , cute ... Oh , look at that . Oh , this is great . This is a great shot . Oh , my God . Get a close-up of this . Look at the size of these scars . Wait a minute . Let 's see here . Wait . Somebody 's been butchering you , haven 't they ? This is like in a concentration camp . You poor dog . Max , Max , come here , Max . Max , sit . Sit . Max , sit . You 're so good . You 're so good , aren 't you ? Hey , don 't worry . No one 's going to hurt you again . You protected me . Now I 'm going to protect you . OK ? Damn truck . Oh , thank you , Max . You 're sweet . Turn around . Baldy , baldy , baldy ! - Aw , screw you . - Screw you ! Lori ? Hey , Lori ! Come on out . I want to show you those new menus I got . Jesus ! Lori , what the hell 's going on in there ? You OK ? Max , calm down ! I 'll be with you in a second , honey ! You stay . What the hell 's going on ? What 's that dog ? Honey ... Annie and I were attacked in the parking lot ... at the market tonight . Jesus . Are you all right ? I 'm OK . Just some asshole with a knife grabbed my purse . Oh , God . Did you call the cops ? I didn 't have to . This dog was in the parking lot . He chased the guy off , and then he went and got my purse ... and brought it back for me . Really ? He saved my life . It was incredible . You should 've seen it . He 's a great guard dog . No , no , no , we are not keeping this dog . That 's like a six-hundred-pound dog , Lori . If he 's that well-trained , he 's got to belong to somebody . They 're gonna want him back . Maybe . L ... I feel a lot safer with him here ... after what happened to me tonight . Lori , you 're always doing this to me , you know ? You 're always bringing something home . You brought home that parrot , that foul-mouthed , messy parrot . And this ugly painting and ... Honey . It 's just ... the point is , you don 't ask me about it . You know ? I just come home , and there 's the stuff , right ? If you wanted a dog , you know ... you should have just told me about it . We 'd go down , and we 'd pick out a nice dog , right ? Don 't you think that would be a better way to do it ? - Yeah , it could be , I guess . - OK , good . - But he 's already here . - No , Lori , No . L ... Why ? I don 't even know what kind of home ... No dog ! No dog ! Just try it with me ! If it doesn 't work out , we 'll give him away . If he stays , he stays in the backyard . I don 't want him running around the house loose . It 's cold out there . Whatever you say , honey . Thanks for being understanding . The toughest part of owning a restaurant ... is picking out the stupid menu . What do you think of this ? Honey . Oh , God ! What are you looking at ? That 's disgusting . How can you read that before you go to bed ? You 're going to get nightmares . - Perry , I 'm ... - I don 't want you ... to get nightmares , sweetheart . I want you to sleep real well . I do . I want you to get a good night 's sleep . - You know what I mean ? - Yes . Good , hmm ? Honey ? I can 't ... What ? The dog 's fine , really . He 's going to bark the first night . That 's just natural . I can 't ... I can 't get into this with him making all that noise . I have to go check on him . I 'm sorry . - OK . - All right ? Fine . Better go check on him . He could be hurt or something . - Who 's going to hurt that dog ? - Fine . Don 't be too long , all right ? Ohh , you ... What are you making so much noise for ? You miss me ? You lonely out there , huh ? Huh , boy ? Come here , Max . Max . Max , come here . No , you can 't go in . No , you can 't go in there . No , you can 't . You can 't go in . Lori ! All right , that 's enough . Out . Max . Oh , Max , go to hell , Max . Get outside . Out . Oh , give me a break . You 're bad . OK . OK , you can stay . OK . But you have to be really quiet ... because we don 't want mean old Perry finding out . OK . Hey , Lori , are you coming up or what ? OK . Honey ? Honey ? Are you asleep ? - So , what took you so long ? - I 'm sorry . - What was the matter with him ? - He 's lonely . Yeah , I know how he feels . I 'm sorry . OK ? So , what did you do to shut him up ? You know , I have a way with men . You 're such a liar . Screw you , mutt ! Is that that dog outside the door ? You let that dog in the house , Lori . I didn ... - He was crying out there . - How could you do that ? I agreed to let you keep him , didn 't I ? The least you could do ... You got to meet me halfway on this one , Lori . OK . OK . No , Max ! No , Max ! No , Max ! No , Max ! No , Max ! - Get him out ! - Got to go , Max . Come on , Max . Come on , Max . We 're going now . Get him out , Lori ! Out ! See what you did ? He 's upset now . Get him out , please . Based on the descriptions you gave us ... we have several suspects . All of them have prior arrests ... for illegal animal rights activities and so forth . So , what we want you to do is take a look ... at a couple of these pictures here . Good . Thank you . Hey , doc , have a seat . I think we got something for you here . Can I have a glass of water ? These are our prime suspects . Thank you . I 'm not sleeping too good . Anything ? No . Take your time . No . Nothing . What are we going to do now ? We 're dusting for prints . I 'm waiting to hear from the lab . No good . Came up empty . You know , we 're on borrowed time , fellas . All right , doc , look . You 're a little strung out . You 're tired . Why don 't you go home ? We 'll round up a few suspects . This bullshit is not gonna do anything . What we gotta do is go out there and rescue my dog . We 're doing the best we can . I 'll tell you something . I 've given a dangerous and experimental animal ... a neuropathic drug to keep him stable ... to keep him calm . When that drug wears off , he is going to snap ! Hey , don 't do that kind of shit in here ! We 're sitting on a time bomb ... and you 're talking about going out and dusting for prints ! Don 't tell us how to do our job . You don 't get it , do you ? Max is fragmenting . He 's coming apart . If I don 't get him tonight ... he 's going to go through a psychotic episode . You 're the only fucking psycho around here . Hey , where you going ? We 're not done . We 're not talking about man 's best friend here . Sorry , pooch . Oh , my God ! I 'm sorry , OK ? OK ? I 'm sorry ! Max ! Max ! Come here , boy ! Breakfast ! Hey , Mr. Ed . Now , today 's word is fartface . Can you say fartface ? - Fartface . Fartface . - Very good . Yes ! - Hey , Lori . - Rudy , how you doing ? I 'm doing fine , but I 'm starving . What are you making ? Fruit and yogurt . Want some ? No , thanks . I 'm allergic . Well , go ahead . Look in the fridge . There 's carrot sticks and apples , some celery juice ... - Cool ! Pizza ! - Some pizza . - It 's been in there a week . - Yeah , just like at home . Who 's that ? - Wow ! When did you get the dog ? - Yesterday . Oh , man . This guy 's even bigger than my collie . - What 's his name ? - Max . Hey , Max , want to come in ? Come on in . Hey , don 't let him get my pizza . Come here . Come here . He 's not allowed in the house . Can I bring him over to my house to meet Heidi ? - Does that sound like fun ? - He 's so cute . All right . Hand me his leash . All right . There you go . - Keep your eye on him . - I will . I will . Be careful . Bring him back in one piece . - You don 't trust me ? - No . Rudy , close the gate when you bring him back . - OK ? - OK . Oh , hi , doggie . You want to help me fix this thing ? You could go over and get that brake line if you wanted to . Whoa . Good boy , Max . Hey , Heidi . Say hello to Max . You like her , huh ? M-M-Max . Max ! Max ! Shh ! You 're going to wake up my dad ! Shut up , Max ! Quiet ! Rudy , what the hell 's going on out here ? You know I 've been working all night . It 's nothing , dad . Max just wanted to play with Heidi . Doesn 't want to play with him , OK ? Now get him out of here so I can get some rest . OK . Come on , Heidi . Come on , Max . Let 's go see Chet . All right ! Good noose . Worthy of the SPCA . Don 't mess with the pros , hairball . Hey , chill , fleabag , or I 'll stun gun your bun . We got him . What do you think you 're doing ? I wasn 't gonna light it . Go ahead . Kill yourself . At your age and weight ... you 're a perfect candidate for a heart attack . - I 'm trying to quit , aren 't I ? - Exactly . I 'm gonna put you on a real fitness program . You 're worse than my wife . In six months , you won 't recognize yourself . Yeah , ' cause I 'll be dead . - What 's this crap ? - Missing persons . Gets a call from a guy named Bill Sanders . His wife Judy doesn 't come home last night . Guess where she works ? Emax . You 're shitting me . Pulled a photo off the computer . Take a look . Maybe we 'd better have another visit with the good doctor . Judy Sanders only worked for me for about three months . I didn 't really know her very well . Her husband says she left for work that morning . Well , she never arrived . That 's all I know . What about my dog ? Any leads ? Keep your shirt on , doc . We 're on top of it . We already fed the description into the computer . All units have been alerted , including animal control . I have to show you something . Friday , bring up the promo material . One moment , please . Voice activation . You know , when you think of guard dogs ... you usually think of German shepherd . They 're loyal , smart , lethal , but not good enough . And now , with the development of the Emax-3000 ... they 're totally obsolete . You see , Max , as I call him , is not your typical dog . He 's a genetic crossbreed . A mutt . I don 't mean a mutt , sir . Look around you . Each of these animals is endowed ... with a specific desirable trait ... that is dedicated to their survival . If you took the DNA from each ... and genetically spliced it ... into the DNA of a breed of a dog ... you would have a magnificent creature . You 've actually been able to do this ? Enhance sight , hearing ... strength , speed , stamina ... the ability to climb with jaguarlike agility ... even a chameleonlike capability ... to camouflage itself if threatened . Each of these traits have been bred into Max . His intelligence is so advanced ... that he can operate as a stand-alone unit ... without a human handler . He can comprehend almost 350 spoken commands . Is that in English or in Spanish ? You take your pick , detective . What I am trying to tell you ... is that in the right hands , Max can save thousands of lives . In the wrong hands , he can be a deadly weapon . Boy , did my brother cut one this morning . Boy , did my brother cut one this morning . Grossed me right out of the kitchen . Sounds like it was nuclear winter in there . Ka-boom ! Look . There 's Mrs. Barclay 's stupid cat Boo . I hate that dumb cat . He always tries to scratch me . Me , too . - Get him , Max ! - Sic ' im ! Come on ! Go ! Go , Max ! Go ! Get him ! Come on , Max ! Get him ! Kick his ass ! Come on ! - Yeah , get him ! - Come on ! Come on ! Wow . You sicked him on that cat , not me . Oh , no , no , no . You did . We better get out of here . Mrs. Barclay will kill us ! Forget about it ! We just got to get out of here ... before he gets us , too ! - Oh , man ! - I told you not to ! - Shut up ! - That was your fault ! Shut up ! Shut up ! - It 's the brake lines . - You 're kidding . Yeah , like , two hundred bucks . - You got the checkbook ? - Yeah . You got it on you ? Maybe . Hey , listen ... why don 't we finish what we started last night , huh ? Because I 'm already late for work . Come here . Curtains are open . So what ? Nobody 's watching . Well , come around , idiot . Come around ! You stupid mutt ! Put a lid on that dog , huh ? Hey , stop ! You stupid mutt ! No , no , no , Max . Come on . You have to ... Max , you have to stay . Max . Go on . You have to stay . Good boy . I 'll be back in a little while . I just have to go to work . It 's OK . I have a deadline to meet . Max . Don 't do this to me , Max . You stay . Do what dogs do ... guard the house . You know . Come on , we got to go . - Dad ... - I don 't want to be late . Come on . Come on , Heidi . You have to stay at home . Come on . You don 't want to miss the game , do you ? OK , I 'm coming . You locked the front door , didn 't you ? - You think I 'd forget ? - All right . Let 's go . Here , kitty , kitty , kitty ! Come here , boo ! Let 's get to work . See how this tape turned out . I need a cappuccino . You want one ? Can we just get into this , please ? So , how was Max last night ? He was a pain in the ass ... but he 's got such a personality . - How did Perry handle it ? - Oh , he loves Max . Right . You didn 't tell him where you got that dog , did you ? He 'll see it on the news . I think something 's gnawed through your brake line somehow . I had my brake lines changed just this morning . See for yourself , huh ? Oh , Jesus . Oh , God . He 's trying to kill me . - Who 's trying to kill you ? - My girlfriend 's dog . Yeah , right . I like that . - Yo , Frank , over here . - What do we got , Dan ? One of the box boys found a body behind the dumpster . It 's pretty bad . Fits the description of the mugger ... that 's been terrorizing the mall . Jesus Christ ! Get ahold of Jarret . I want him to look at this . You won 't be mugging anybody no more , pal . The lacerations , the power , the efficiency ... yes , it was Max . Put this bastard out of business . Put him out of business ? He killed him , for Christ 's sake . That 's what he was designed to do , sir . What is the matter , detective ? You upset that Max did your job for you ? - Want to see me do my job ? - Yeah , do your job . I 'll do my job , all right . Emilio , get on the blower ... and tell every black and white in San Remo ... that if they find this ... this canine ... to blow its friggin ' head off ! I wouldn 't do that if I were you , detective . I don 't think this city could survive ... a multimillion dollar lawsuit 'cause you went off half-cocked . Half-cocked ? Somebody died here . This was a predator who preyed on innocent people . People have to cower in their homes ... because you two are standing around bullshitting . Eat shit . Max doesn 't deserve a bullet . He deserves a medal . Friday , what is the maximum amount of time left ... before Max becomes completely destabilized ? One moment , please . 5 hours , 29 minutes , and 14 seconds . And the minimum ? The minimum time has already expired . Hi there , buddy . Hey , big fella . Easy now , boy . Easy , easy . Take it easy now . Don 't be stupid . You must be new in the neighborhood . I think it 's time we met . Try something , you son of a bitch . Dr. Jarret ? I found something . Hey , Glen , you got any blank tape I can steal ? - Hurry . - I 'm trying . Go ! Jesus ! - We 're in big trouble . - Why ? I just saw Dr. Jarret out front . Hi , Lori . This is Deborah at the front desk . Yeah . I 've got a Dr. Jarret here to see you . Sure . I 'm sorry , sir . Miss Tanner 's not available right now . Hey , look , it 's urgent that I talk to her . Sir , please step outside . Where are you going ? I just ... I got to do something with Max . What are you gonna do with him ? I don 't know ! Hide him . Put him in a kennel somewhere . Lori , that 's probably the first place he 'll go looking for him . You just have to give him away to somebody . - Who ? - I don 't know . Check the paper . There 's got to be somebody looking for a great guard dog . Sir , please leave the building peacefully ... or I 'm going to have to call security . What ? - Don 't make me do this . - Wait a second . - Come on , listen . - Don 't do that . Please , sir , leave the building . She is not available to talk to you right now . - Call her back ... - Ray ! Excuse me , sir . You 're going to have to step outside . Get the hell out of here . - Come on , let 's go , let 's go . - OK , OK . Jerk . Hey , Lori ! Hello , fartface ! Max ? Oh , Max ! I got something for you , Max . Lunchtime ! Hey , buddy , how you doing ? Look what I got for you , huh ? Look at that . Some nice steak tartare from the restaurant . It 's all for you , buddy , OK ? Good boy . Go ahead . Eat up , boy . That 's it . I made that special for you , all right ? Go on , Max . Eat up , buddy . It 's good . Yum yum yum . Eat the food , Max . Hey , fleabag ! Muttonhead ! Max ! Max . Hi , Max . Come on , boy . Come on , boy . We got to go for a ride . That 's a good boy . Come on . Come on . Good boy . Come on . Oh , good boy . OK , stop stuffing your face for one minute . I got news . I think Dr. Jarret 's psychotic superdog killed Judy Sanders ... the girl who disappeared from Emax . Check this out . He got his Ph.D. From Berkeley at twenty . By the time he was twenty-eight ... he was patenting this new synthetic hormone . Made him a multimillionaire overnight . All right , he 's got a wonderful resume . What else ? Here 's where the story gets interesting . About six years ago , Jarret gets busted ... experimenting on endangered species . His investors pulled out ... and he 's rejected by the scientific community . He has a nervous breakdown . About a year later ... he gets out of the hospital , takes Emax private ... and starts breeding these friggin ' guard dogs . He 's got everything he has riding on their success . He 'd do anything to protect that animal . I say we get a warrant , go to Emax . I bet we find the body . - Hi . - How are you doing ? - See the scars ? - Yeah . Get them . Go all the way up and down . - Do you have us both in frame ? - Yeah . Why ? I want to do the intro to the story . Are you crazy ? We can do that later . No . It 's perfect . Now , now . Do I look OK ? You look beautiful . Just hurry . Dog slobber . - Lori ? - Ray ? Come here , boy . Come on , I 'm not going to hurt you . How are we going to become friends ... if you 're going to act like that ? I 've got a nice piece of rawhide for you . You know you want that . Come get it . Come get it . You 're a big dog . Handsome , too , aren 't you ? I bet you get all the girls . Huh ? Hey , you want some more ? Boy , I sure would like to have him around . So , where would Max live , exactly ? Well , not here , that 's for sure . OK . No , I got a big ranch of about 15 acres out in Shadow Hills . My dog Wayne used to love it out there . That sounds great . There 's plenty of room to run around in ... rabbits to chase , creeks to swim in . Dog 's got a good life if he 's with me . I need to know I can have him back if things change . This isn 't easy . Oh , he 'll be all right . Just give him a couple of days up at the ranch ... he won 't even remember you . I 'm sorry , Max . I have to do this . Otherwise , they 're going to take you back to the lab . Remember I promised I would take care of you ? Huh ? Besides , Ray 's going to look after you . - Isn 't that right , Ray ? - That sure is right . We 're gonna have a great time together . Aren 't we , Max ? OK , Max , you be good . Stay with Ray now , OK ? I 'll be back for you . You 'll be fine , boy . Easy , boy , easy . That 's enough of that . Settle down , boy . She dumped you , just like they all do . I said settle down , you worthless piece of dog shit . I asked you nice , didn 't I ? - Hello . - Lori ? Look , I don 't know if you 're gonna believe this or not ... but I think your dog tried to kill me today . What are you talking about ? Well , he gnawed through my brake lines ... and I almost crashed going down the highway . That 's crazy , Perry . Oh , I know it 's crazy , but I swear to God it 's true , Lori . And then when I finally got home , he attacked me . The dog 's got to go . - He 's gone , OK ? - What ? - I just gave him away . - Lor-Lori ... What 's the matter , boy ? Don 't you like my ranch ?

 [ Bell Ringing ] Wy , I have done the impossible . I have achieved the unachievable . - Got a date ? - Yeah . Hey ... Lucky guess . What are the specs ? Me , Janine Dunivan , tonight . Thank you . That 's great . We 're going to the sound garden concert . - Please don 't be mad . - Those were our tickets . You think she 's want to sit and talk ? I needed bait . I 've looked forward to that concert . - But that 's not all . - What ? I get to wear a little hat and drive you there ? No , I 'm going to pay you back . Anything you want , you got it . Okay , I 'll trade you my concert ticket but only if you can find me a date tonight too . Tonight , a date . No problem . I can fix you up with Sharon Huff . - She owes me big-time . - Uh-uh . Not just any date , a great date . I 'm making you work for this . Okay , so what 'll it be ? She 's got to be good-looking and into video games . She 's got to like mystery science theater- - someone who 's classy but isn 't afraid to pee in the bushes and she 's got to be smart . Couldn 't I give you a McDonalds gift certificate ? You want that ticket , you fill that order . [ Bell Ringing ] This should do the trick , and to get the ball rolling ... - Excuse me . - Mm-hmm ? Do you like foreign films Indian Food , Gortex Compuserve , X-Men , Speed Racer ? Let me ask you this : have you ever peed in Bush ? Well ? I 'm so excited . I didn 't think you 'd really come through on this . Give me a hint . What are her initials ? After all that footwork , you think I 'm blabbing now ? What time did you tell to meet us here ? Excuse me . Bladder the size of a peanut . I called you a half hour ago . Seinfeld rerun . How 's the happy foursome ? It 's a threesome , and I 'm not happy . Where is Wyatt 's date ? There weren 't any takers , and I 'm running out of time . I got to get Wyatt a date . If only there were some magic way . - Oh , but it 's hopeless . - Gary , I 'm not a dating service . Please ? I can 't let him down . Maybe I can find someone but just for tonight . Great . Here 's your shopping list . Happy hunting . " Must like making baloney snowflakes " ? You thought it was easy . Oh , and the clock 's ticking . You were gone a while . Is she here yet ? No , not yet but she will be any minute , right through those doors and you will be blown away . It 's not happening . You couldn 't find me a date . No , it 's happening . She 's coming . Forget it . Hi . You must be Wyatt . I 'm Rachel . Sorry I 'm late . - Whoa , static reaction . - Instant attraction . - Hi , I 'm Janine . - Hi . - Well , you hungry ? - Is this baloney ? Yeah . Hmm . ZWA baloney snowflakes . You know , Gary told me a lot about you but he didn 't mention how cute you were . He didn 't tell me about you either . - Let me help you . - Ohh . Oh , allow me . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . She 's got a mole the size of a fishcake . I 'll be right back . - So , how did I do ? - What the hell is sitting next to Wyatt ? His date . Isn 't she pretty ? If you don 't mind flashing lights in her head . - She is a robot . - A robot ? You wanted a girl who shared Wyatt 's interests . - Yeah . So ? - You gave me three minutes . - She turned out rather well . - He 's going to know . He won 't have time to catch on . Rachel 's battery can only last six hours . What can happen in one date ? - I had a great time tonight . - Me too . Gary and Janine seem really nice . I never thought I 'd meet someone like you . You 're so different from most girls . Uh , Gary . Thanks , but you can go now . Oops . Sorry . Leave . I know this sounds dopey . But you know where I 'd like to be with you right now ? - Where ? - Up there . - Your parents ' bedroom ? - Well , no . I meant ... there . That cloud . The altocumulus or the nimbostratus ? - You know your clouds - I know my clouds . I can see it . Just the two of us up there . Thousands of feet above the Earth . Looking down at everything . I don 't think that 's dopey . So , do you need a ride home or anything ? Um , I could take her home . Gary , what are you doing here ? You ? I should be the one to take her home . But you can 't . Right now is the perfect moment to say good night . The stars are shining . The clouds are ... cloudy . Besides , you can 't drive a stick . Oh . Maybe you 're right . Good night , Rachel . It was great meeting you . You too , Wyatt . Do you want to do this again sometime soon ? Sure . There 's a mystery science theater marathon - this weekend . - Great . Okay . Bus is leaving . Let 's hit the road . Gar , thanks . She 's too good to be true . I had my doubt but you really did it this time . - The concert ticket 's yours . - Wy , I ... Oh , get her phone number for me . I don 't want to look too pushy . - I 'll see what I can do ? - ' Night . [ Zapping Sound ] Whew . Just made it . Six hours on the nose . Congratulations . You made it through the date . Their first date . They just made date number two . And the converation might be one-sided . So now what ? We must figure out how to break the date . But first let 's get her out of here . You might want to put some newspaper under her . She 's leaking oil . What if someone finds her ? Will she be safe ? - [ Beeping ] - She is now . GARY : Ready when you are . Okay . Turn her over . Nice and easy . Gun it ! Whoa . Um ! I 'm all biologied-out . - Me too . - Study break ? What do you have in mind ? - You sure they can 't see us ? - Nope . We 're invisible . Can 't hear us either . [ Slow Pop Music Playing ] Can I have this dance ? - Uh-oh . - What , " uh-oh " ? I didn 't program her with dancing abilities . Well , she can 't just stand there do something . - What is this ? - It 's an interactive body suit . Whatever you do , she 'll do . So start dancing , Rachel ? Are you okay , Rachel ? Wow . You move like a ballerina . This never happened . - I really like you , Rachel . - I really like you too , Wyatt . Aw , man , he 's going to kiss me . Thought I 'd give him a thrill . Well , well if it isn 't love-runt bumping and grinding his way ' round the living room . Hm . Outstanding , little brother . You have outdone yourself . But there 's one thing I don 't understand . What is a hot ticket like you doing with a driblle-lip feeb like this ? Now that the formal introductions are out of the way could you please leave us alone ? I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm fascinated . I 'm used to seeing Wyatt with dates that bleat or moo . [ Raucous Laughter ] [ Sighs ] - Sorry , Rachel . - Oh , no . It 's fine . Seeing his brother with an attractive girl reminds him of his own overwhelming loneliness and threatens his masculinity . How long has it been ... [ Bleating : ] Che-eh-it ? That 's it . You 're dead . [ Grunting ] Now you know who you 're really mad at , don 't you ? You 're mad at Chett . Wow ! She 's good . - You 're lucky you 're a girl , or I 'd ... - [ Howling ] - Uncle , uncle , uncle . - Isn 't there something you want to say to your brother ? [ Whimpering ] She 's a keeper . - I hope I didn 't embarrass you . - Well ... actually it was a little weird having my date protect me from my big brother but it sure was fun to watch . Thank you . I 'm going to get something to drink . You want anything ? Uh-oh . Her battery is dead again . Okay , we 're on . Let him see us . Rachel ? - Hey . - Not again . What 's your problem ? What are you doing here ? What the hell are you wearing ? Nighttime jogging suit . So , how 's the date going ? Oh , great . Where did Rachel go ? Oh , I think she had to go freshen up . [ Buzzing ] I 'm in heaven , Gary . Beyond heaven . I think I 'll ask her to the senior prom . That 's two years away . Aren 't you rushing a little ? I know . Usually I 'm hopeless about relationships . But Rachel 's different . Yeah ... you could say that . I 'm in love , Gary . Really in love . I 've never felt this way about anyone before . Wy , buddy , there 's something I should tell you about Rachel . Wyatt ... I hope you don 't mind . I pok a look around . You have the coolest room . Isn 't she great ? [ Chattering ] Rachel ? I 'm sorry , Gary . What were you going to tell me about Rachel ? How could you do this ? You lied to me . You build the perfect girl and of course , I 'm going to fall in love . What were you thinking ? It was supposed to be a one-night deal . We didn 't know you two would hit it off . You programmed her to fall in love with me , right ? No , I had nothing to do with that . Rachel learned to love you on her own . Oh , that 's even better . I won her heart . - Which piece would that be ? - Wy , look , I 'm sorry about this . - I 'll get rid of her . - No ! She 's the most wonderful girl I ever met . I don 't care if she 's a robot . We made plans together . - I can make this work . - Step back a moment and think about what you 're saying , Wyatt . She 's a machine . You 're a human being . How do you see this working out ? Rachel and I truly love each other . That 's all that matters . You got to help me put her together . Please ? Okay ... if it 's love . But we 're doing this under protest . Go ahead , Wyatt . She 's all yours . Hi . I missed you . I missed you too . - [ Crunching Sound ] - Turn her off , turn her off ! I don 't think this is such a good idea . Maybe you should date the clock-radio . It would be a whole lot safer . No , I 'm going to make this work . Wyatt , when are you going to give this up ? Monday , her eye popped out . Tuesday , she shorted out in the rain . Thursday , she backed over a dog . Now , she 's losing limbs . You 're in love with a lemon . It has it 's bumps but then every relationship does , right ? Super glue , super glue ... great , Wyatt . You 're handling this really well . How 's Rachel dealing with her being a robot and you human ? That whole mixed marriage thing ? We never really talking about it . She does know , doesn 't she ? She 's a ... a ... robo-babe ? - I never mentioned it to her . - I got to tell her then . Our relationship 's based on honestly . And WD-40 . Why are we here we were going to a movie . There 's something I have to talk to you about . And it 's kind of serious . Did you ever feel like you don 't completely fit in ? Like something about you is ... A little different from everyone else ? What are you trying ot say , Wyatt ? I 'll be straight with you . Pencil ... pencil ... pencil ... mechanical pencil . - You follow ? - Sure . Pen ... pen ... pen ... protractor . - Let 's go . - No , wait , wait . - You don 't get it , do you ? - Get what ? - I want to go to the movie . - I ... uh ... I don 't know how else to tell you this . Sit down . You 're not ... human . Yeah ? ... And ? ... You 're a robot , Rachel . I know . Aren 't you ? No , of course not . I 'm human . - Flesh and blood . - You 're what ? All the time we spent together and you never once mentioned you 're a water-based organism ? - Huh ? - How could you ? I mean , sure , we share all the same interests but eventually your heart is going to weaken - and stop I 'll be around forever . - But ... Face it , Wyatt . You 're biodegradable . How can I spend my eternity knowing my one true love is going to rot like a compost heap ? Oh , yeah ? Well , what about you ? Unless somebody plugs you in you wear out faster - than a wind-up monkey . - Granted , I have a few bugs but I can be repaired . Let 's not fight . You 're special , Wyatt , but it 's not going to work . - You 're breaking up with me ? - I 'm sorry . I had a great time with you . I really did . But I 'm looking for more than just some 70-year fling . Can it hurt to ask for one last kiss good-bye ? Of course not . Man ... dumped by a robot . We were perfect together . I 'll never find another girl like her . LISA : She 's was a machine . You 're a human being . It never would have worked . But I 'll let you in on a little secret . I based her on a real person . - You based Rachel on her ? - You got a second chance . Hi . I have a big Earth science test coming up and I was wondering if you knew anything about ... clouds . I saw one the other day who looked like a unicorn . But the more I stared the more it looked like that dude from KnightRider . Uncle had a talking car . It told him his door was open . Is that weird or what ? I 'm rambling , aren 't I ? What did you ask me again ? I can make this work . Captioned by Grantman Brown

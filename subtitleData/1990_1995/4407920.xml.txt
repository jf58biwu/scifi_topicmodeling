And you know , my friend , Bobbi , she always says : Knowing is one thing , but doing something about it is ... another ... well , Anyway , the problem is , I 've got this poem that I have to read in public . It 's probably the last chance to see if I can hack it on the circuit as a poet . Well , I 'm scare to death I 'm gonna need to drink to do it . I 'm scare to death . I appreciate you bringing this to me , Butch , but ... you could have called it in or fax it to me ... All part of the service , Ruthie . Thank you . Um ... any plans on coming up to Derry sometime .

Anything new ? All quiet on this front , captain . When 're you gonna ask that Merril woman out on a date ? . Don 't you guys have something better to do than worry about my private life jingles ? Like checking all the diners in northern Maine for health violations or something ? You can bark all you want to , but just because she was your partner 's wife and a damned fine constable , besides , there 's no reason not to speak your heart . Let it be , fellas , let it be ...

Hey lady ... why don 't you get your dog out of here ? Our last poet is no stranger to those of you who remember " Raging Angel " . The book that some critics claimed ... gave authority to voice to the angst of the last decade . I trust he will provide us with a memorable finish reading us his latest work . Friends of new poetry , I give you James Eric Gardener . Gardener . Good evening . I was going to try to leave up to my reputation ... and read something new and angry tonight . But instead I think I 'll be a little umpredictable and read something from my first book . It 's a love poem called : One more mile . It 's for Bobbi Anderson . Only for you . I was raised to believe God was love ... But how loving can God be when he makes man and woman smart enough ... to land on the moon ... but stupid enough to have to learn that there 's no such thing as forever ? Only have to learn it over and over again . One more mile . Just one more mile . Then one day I dreamed I found you ... Illusion made substance , in a dream realer than any ... . ... Your eyes looked up at me and saw the me After all these doubts and all these fears ... after all these questions without answers . And dreams without substance . I journeyed home One more mile ... Just one last mile . ... and there you were . Thank you , thank you ... thank you very much . Well , are you sure you 're ringing the right room ? He is with the New England poetry caravan ... I have been ringing Ma 'am . Would you like to leave a message ? Uh , yeah ... just tell him ... No , never mind . Just , no , thanks ... I 'll just uh ... try later . Well , he 'd see it alright . He said : Bobbi ... Cadillacs don 't receed ... we gotta find out where he 's been and what he 's gotten into . Oh , buddy , I know where you 've been . I 'll take a better look . Peter , come here . Ok , listen . I don 't want you going with me cause I don 't want you freaking out , alright ? So just go on back to the house . Go on ! Good boy ! What the hell are you ? My folks will kill me if they found out we were here . Who 's gonna tell 'em ? Gramps says this is where the Indians used to pray to the gods . - Give me a break ! - Really ! They believed this was a place of magic , in between the spirit world and the real . Agghh ... grose ! Whaaa ... what do you think killed it ? probably ate some poisoned bait . Yeah , maybe it was sacrificed to the gods . What ? Don 't you hear it ? Gramp 's was right . - Hilly ... . - Run , Barney ! What are you kids doing here ? You shouldn 't be alone in the woods . Let 's go call your dad . He can pick you up . A drink , sir ? Uhh .. tonic water , please . I ... think your poem was wonderful tonight , Mr Gardener . Thank you very much , son . Hey , my friends call me Jim . - Thanks . - Everything alright , Gardener ? Ah , Patricia , I didn 't know you cared . - Tonic water . - I 'm doubious . Yes , you always have , but what you really are , though , Patty is a ... little ticked off , aren 't you ? I mean , I got the biggest hand of the day . I pay you to read new poetry . Not old stuff . When 's the last poem you wrote that got published ? When 's the last poem you wrote that was any good ? You may fool them ... you don 't fool me . You are nothing but a drunk , Gardener . Always were ... always will be . Why don 't we add some vodka to that ? Whatever you say , Mr. Gardener I say ... uh , second thoughts ... hold the tonic . Hi , Pearl how are you ? Hi sheriff ! What can I do for you ? Oh , well , just my usual wash and fluff . Don 't listen to a word she says , Pearl . You gotta doll her all up . - She 's got a big date and I do mean ... - Do you mind ... please ? - Big ! - Becka stop it ! She 's going to the movies with Butch . Tell the world why don 't you ?

It sounds so much better , don 't you think ? Mr. Arglebargle ... hello . - Maybe you 'd better call it a night .. - Yess , sir , maybe ... maybe you 're right .

Let 's go find her ! Is there news about Davey ? No , ma 'am ... I 'm sorry ... Liste , has either one of you seen Ruth Merril today ? - No . - Well , when was the last time you spoke to her ? Uh ... yesterday . No , it was the day before yesterday . She came in to tell us that she hadn 't given up hope on Davey . She 's a damn nice lady . We 're real lucky to have her as our Sheriff . Are you sure you haven 't seen her passing by or anything ? Why ? Does something happened ? I don 't know , that 's what we 're trying to find out ! We were talking on the phone yesterday and the connection went to hell . Well , the phone lines around here are ancient . You might as well get a couple if tin cans and put a string in between them . What , the thing is , nobody 's seen or heard from her since . She 's missing ! First , Davey , now Ruth . Can 't the police do anything ? What good are you ! Honey , he 's doing everything he can ... It 's not his fault ! Women . Look , where 's your father-in-law ? I 'd like to talk to him . Well , he 's off in Derry , at the hospital with our other boy . But I 'll tell you something between the two of us , officer , he is mad as a = = = . It 's alright , Hilly , it 's grampy , I 'm right here . Mr. Hillman , he can 't hear you . What 's causing this coma ? It isn 't coma , it 's shock . Well , whatever you call it , sleeping away is what it comes right down to ... Mr. Hillman , what are his parents been feeding him ? Regular food , why do you ask ? He has lost several of his permanent teeth . It 's me , Joe . I miss you ... I really do . But , you know , since you been gone , the people in town , they really like me now . Maybe it 's because of this gadgets I keep inventing . Look what I dreamed of this time ! Wait ' til you see what it does . Are you watching ? Do you love it ? Well , I gotta go now ... and , dear , don 't misunderstand ... what we had it was really fun . But I need to get on with the rest of my life . The time of mourning is over . Are you ever gonna get this blasted thing fixed ? Damn machine , it 's got a mind if its own . Give it a good kick . You okay , boss ? You 're looking little picked . Just the heat , that 's all . You boys check out all the neighboring farms . I might go out and see that book writer , the Anderson woman . Ruth was friends with her , maybe she knows something . I 'll check in with you later . Officer Dugan ? Miss Anderson ... I 'm afraid I 've got some bad news . I don 't know if you 've heard , but ... Ruth Merrill 's missing . Oh , my God ! I don 't know what to think , I was hoping you could help . I haven 't seen Ruth since the 4th of July . How about that fella that lives with you , Jim Gardener ? Do you think he might know something ? I doubt it , but I should ask him as soon as he gets back . You are okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine , it 's just the heat . Well , there 's a terrible flu running around . You be careful not to catch it . Officer ? - If you hear anything call me as soon as you know . - Yes , ma 'am What did he want ? Ruth 's missing ... Bobbi , little kids get lost , Ruth 's an adult , She 's a cop , she finds people . She doesn 't disappear . Something is happening to you , something is happening to this town . And I 'm telling you it has to do with that thing in the woods . Now , I want you to help me to try to find what it is , so we can stop it , okay ? . Stop it ? No ... No ! - Gard ? Gard ! - I 'm gonna tell it to them . They 'll see it ! It 's right out there ! - Gard , you promised to help me ! - Yeah ? All these years I stood by you when you needed me ... I stood by you when you were drunk ... when you hated yourself ... when you couldn 't even write a line of poetry , I stood by you ! You stay by me ! Don 't you betray me like this ! I love you , Bobbi , and I 'm trying to help you . If you leave now , don 't bother coming back . - You don 't mean that . - Try me ! Unit 16 to base , do you copy ? over . Unit 16 to base , do you copy ? Oddest darned thing . First it rains , then it pours . I don 't like this ... I don 't like it at all ... Jingles , Bent , come in . Butch ! there you are ! Things are just fine , it 's all been a wild goose chase for nothing . You mean it , boss ? You want us to call off the search ? I 'll explain it to you when I get back to Derry . 10-4 and out . How 'd I do ? You could have been on " Star Search " . Hell , you could have won it ! - You really think so ? - Yes , I do , Mabel . 10-4 and out . What do you mean he 's gone back to Derry , Elt ? Looked real punky , sick as a dog alright . What about his men ? Have they left too ? Oh , they 're around , somewhere ... - Damned it ! - Why ? Is it something wrong ? I just needed to talk to Dugan , I need to talk to him . Is something I can do to help , son ? Yeah ... I 'd like to use the phone in there , if I can . Uh ... sorry , it 's on the fritz , but the bar 's got one , try theirs . Pull over again , I 'm sick ! It 's Ruth Merrill 's car ! - I don 't like this . - Me neither . Hey , boys ... What you big old bears doing out here in the woods all by yourselves ? We 're in an important police business , ma 'am . Is he always so mean and grumpy ? - Is he like that to you too , trooper , or it 's just me ? - I ... I mean it , ma 'am , on your way . Or I 'll put you under arrest . Under arrest ? Really Bent ? Jingles ... could you get the hell away from her ? Okay , boys ... I just wish you 'd known better than to come snooping aroung like this . - Hold it right there now ! Put up your hands . - Come on , Bent ! I mean it , lady ! Put 'em up ! Do as he says , ma 'am . You wouldn 't stop a lady from putting on a little lipstick , would you ? Some people call it , Final Passion . I call it , Final Surprise . Bye-bye , boys . Unblink , uh ? Everything in this town is unblink . So , shoot a pickle . Well , it 's technology ... I mean , You keep spending more and more , and it works less and less ... So , I say : - Shoot a pickle . - Right . - Pull up a chair . - No , thanks , I ... Something is bothering you , right ? Yeah , I guess you could say that . Yeah , me too . Anything new on the boys ? Nope . Now , the little lady 's gone ' round the bend . It runs in the family ... I mean , her old men is too . - Say , why don 't you pull up a chair ? - No , really , thanks . Well , a nice cold one has been known to take the curse off of anything . Anything uh ? Yeah , you know , looking at you I would say that you 're a vodka-tonic man . Hold the tonic , right ? Come on , pull up a chair , I 'll buy . What do you say ? - I say , shoot the pickle . - Shoot the pickle ... Bill ! The best . - Hey , Gardener ! Did those staties find you ? - No , did they leave yet ? - Oh , they 're gone alright . Good night boys ! Did you tell them I was looking for 'em , Elt ? I 'm probably hallucinating all of this , anyways . Can I give you a ride home ? Cause Bobbi 'll kill me if you hurt yourself for running into a tree . No , thanks , I 'll be alright . Shoot a pickle . I need some air . After all this doubts , and all these dreams ... after all this ... I keep coming home to you . Mr. Hillman ... I have known Ruth Merrill for 40 years . She was like family , to me and my boys . Hell , we all went fly-fishing together . I know . Just about broke her heart that we couldn 't find your grandson . Do you have any idea what could have happened to her ? Whatever it is , I bet somehow , it 's tied up to Davey . Two disappearances in one week . That 's more than coincidence . On my years on the force I 've never seen anything like it . They just vanished ... into thin air , without a trace . - Butch , did you ever heard of the Tommyknockers ? - Mm ? Last night and the night before ... Tommyknockers , Tommyknockers , knocking at the door Before Hilly went into a coma he said Davey was with the Tommyknockers . Well , I don 't have much time for nursery rhymes , Mr. Hillman . Maybe , Hilly was right ... you said yourself it was as if they had vanished into thin air . Well ... I 'll think about it . If anything else occurs to you , give me a call . Good night . Lord , I know I 've not been in good terms with you , but this ain 't for me . My two grandsons deserve their time in the sun , and so does Ruth Merrill , and all the good people in Haven . We need your help to fight this thing , whatever it is Please , Lord ? We are about to reach the final fase ... but we must be careful . Is everything in readiness ? The detour signs are up . Anyone who makes it through , will wish he didn 't . Like those two " staties " ... They got a nasty surprise . 1 , 2 , 3 , my gadget sent them to the twilight zone . Zapping them wasn 't necessary . In time , they would 've become ! - Not every one has become . - Your man hasn 't . He will , it will happen to him too . I can 't read his mind . He 's not like us . He 's dangerous . He can mean the end of us . One man ? - I say zap him ! - I say not ! Leave him to me . The time for all of us to unite is at hand Are you ready to complete the becoming ? Yes . Are you ready to become one voice that will soon be free ? Yes . A great powerful voice , that will know more ... ! - Yes . - Do more ... ! - Yes . - Be more ... ! One voice ! One voice ! Bobbi , Bobbi , no . - Get him ! - Noooooo ! Don 't worry ! He won 't get far . Operator ... Looking for something ? Well , I was looking for a gun , in case there 's uh ... any trouble . I like a man who 's ready for anything . What are you doing here , Nancy ? Just cooking up a little something ... You never know when a gun might come in handy . Exactly . So , what 'd you do to it ? Just fiddled with it a little ... you know , give it some extra kick . All you gotta do is hold it real tight . - Can you do that ? - Sure . And aim it . ohhh , you got a strong grip . And then firmly pull the trigger ... Anyone in front of it will be history . I like a man who knows the value of prepareness . Nancy ... I was a boy scout . I bet you were . You got great lips ... Won 't you try 'em ? - Killer lips . - Will be the death of you yet . You might find this interesting . Here you go . Anything he could 've come in contact with ... Hunting accident in woods Man kills wife , kids and then kills himself Indian chief on deathbed claims woods cursed . That 's it . The future ... our future , if there 's anyone in this world that I wanna share it with , it 's you Look what the cat dragged in ! - Join us . - What am I ? a prisoner ? I 'll never join you , Bobbi , and I 'll never become . Hey , poet ! Let 's see if you can dig as well as you can drink ! Bent and Jingles , come in , over ... The lines in Haven must be down . Which lines ? All of them , some kind of storm , maybe . A hell of a storm , alright ! The way I figure it , Ruth found out something about Davey ... and now , they 've got her , too . They ? Are you saying there 's some kind of conspiracy going on in Haven ? There 's a conspiracy , alright , one hell of a conspiracy . Going back at least , as far as the indians . and I should 've known you wouldn 't believe me . Well , I am trying to , old timer , but you 're not making it very easy . And if you got anything for real , spit it out ! First , we got three disappearances that are related : My grandson Davey , Ruth , and now your two troopers . See , a lot of fishy things have been going on in those woods around Haven over the years . Hunters getting lost , people going crazy ... and shooting each other for no reason . Well , all woods have stories like these . We got all sorts of special things : Men murdering whole families , and then killing themselves ! It 's like this big jigsaw puzzle .

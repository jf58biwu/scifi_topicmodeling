 - What is it ? - It 's a banana . No . Try again . What is it ? - A banana ? - No , it isn 't . What is it ? It 's an urrrr ... It 's an urrrr ... It 's an orange . Go on , say it . - This is an orange . - It 's an orrrr ... It 's an orrrr ... It 's a banana . It 's no good . I just can 't do it . You CAN do it . I 'm gonna teach you . OK , what 's this ? - An ap ... - No , no . What is it ? Oh , it 's no good , sir . I can 't lie . I 'm programmed to tell the truth . Kryten , it 's easy . Look - an orange , a melon , a female aardvark . Oh , that is superb ! How DO you do that ? Especially calling a banana an aardvark . An aardvark isn 't even a fruit . It 's total genius . - Let 's start again . - Sir , we 've been doing this all morning . Kryten , I 'm going to teach you to lie and cheat , to be unpleasant , cruel and sarcastic . It 's the only way to break your programming , make you independent . I 'm truly grateful , sir . I 'd love to be deceitful , unpleasant and offensive . Those are the human qualities I admire the most . But I can 't do it . - You can ! - I can 't . - What 's this ? - No ! - What is it ? - Please ! - What is it ? - It 's a ... It 's a ... It 's a small , off-duty Czechoslovakian traffic warden . Yes ! You did it ! What 's this ? - It 's a red and blue golfing umbrella . - Kryten ! Yes ! - What 's this ? - It 's an apple . - No . What is it ? - It 's ... It 's ... It 's the Bolivian navy on manoeuvres . - Kryten , you can do it . - No , I can 't . Yes , you ... Whoa , nice one ! I can 't hang around . I 'd better take the penguin for a walk . I can do it ! I did it again ! I can lie ! - Cat , come here . Check this . Check this . - Check what ? Concentrate , Kryten . What 's this ? It 's a banana . - What 's this ? - It 's an orange . - What 's this ? - Apple . You taught him that ? That 's terrific . You two should audition for " What 's My Fruit ? " - He did it wrong . - It gets better ? - I just can 't do it . - You just did it . Not when there 's someone else there . What 's a suitable human analogy ? It 's like trying to urinate standing next to a man two foot taller than you . - It 's just not possible . - What are you trying to do ? - He 's trying to teach me to lie . - Any reason ? Yeah . Lying 's a vital part of your psychological defence system . If you can 't lie , you can 't conceal your true intentions . Sometimes that 's essential . Take Nelson , when he put the telescope to his blind eye and said , " I see no ships . " Or Humphrey Bogart in " Casablanca " , when he lies to Victor Laszlo to spare his feelings . I understand , sir . How often have we watched that movie ? I know it can be noble to lie . I just can 't . Kryten , you can . Look , what 's this ? It 's a banana . It always has been . It always will be . It 's a yellow fruit that you unzip and eat . A banana . - Lister , is Kryten with you ? - Yeah , what 's the prob ? I 've been waiting 20 minutes for him in the hangar , Oh , spin my nipple nuts and send me to Alaska ! I 'm supposed to take him asteroid spotting . - I 'll be right down , sir . - You 'd better be , Kryten , remember yesterday 's class on insults ? - I 'm not sure ... - How do we describe that gentleman ? - He 's Mr ... - No , no , no . He 's a ... - He 's a smeee ... - Nearly . Come on . Nearly . - He 's a smeee ... - He 's a ... He 's a smeee ... He 's a smeeeg ... heeeeead . I did it ! Brutal . Now the ultimate test - can you say it to him in person ? Ah , Kryten . At last . Glad you could make it this millennium . Smeeeee ... - Pardon ? - Smeeeee ... heeeee ... - What ? - You 're a smeeeee ... heeeee ... Oh , forget it . Kryten , could we go just a bit faster ? So we 're not being overtaken by stationary objects ? Sir , you 're a smeeeee ... - A smee . - A smeeeee ... heeeee ... A smee-hee . A complete and total one . I 'm picking something up . Some kind of distress beacon . I copy that , Holly . Quadrant four-niner-seven . - What is it ? - Hard to tell , but it 's marooned on a planet in decaying orbit . - Safety margin ? - Planet 'll explode in two hours . - Forget it . It 's too dangerous . - We can 't leave them , sir . - There may be survivors . - Leave it , Kryten . That 's an order . - What are you doing ? - I 'm not taking her down . - Yes , you are . - Nor am I checking the vessel for survivors . Kryten , this is mutiny . I could have you dismantled . Smeeeee ... heeeee ... Oh , damn my programming ! Not back yet ? They 've been hours . - No sign . What are you watching ? - Just a vid . - This is a classic . - What is it ? " Tales Of The Riverbank : The Next Generation . " Oh , right . I 've seen this . It 's not as good as the original . Well , they never replaced Hammy Hamster . How could they ? The dude smouldered . The camera loved him . Yeah . He was the rodent equivalent of Marlon Brando . Whatever happened to old Hammy ? One minute he 's a huge star with a personalised gold wheel and as much Edam as he could hold in his little cheeks , the next , obscurity . Probably went on the slide . The series ended , couldn 't find work , and then the ultimate humiliation ... hamstergrams . Well , thanks a bunch , Thanks a smegging buncharoony , - Rimmer , where are you ? - That idiot droid has endangered this vessel by landing on a planet that 's about to explode , thanks to your foundation course in advanced rebellion , - Why ? - To search some starship escape vessel because there 's a million-to-one chance there may be a survivor , - You let him go alone ? - Of course , I was glad to get rid of him , He 's flipped , He 's got mad droid disease , He kept waving a banana around and calling it a female aardvark , Well , you 'd better get after him . - He might need help . - Lister , this is your fault , Hello ? Is there anyone here ? Can anyone read me ? Oh , dear . What a terrible mess . Help ! Mr Rimmer , sir ! Sir ? I thank you from the bottom of my rehydration units . You saved my life . You responded to my distress call . You saved mine . - My name is Kryten . - Camille . Pleased to meet you . - Are you a 4,000 series ? - Yes , I 'm the 4,000 series GTi . GTi ! Oh , wow ! I 'm just a plain old 4,000 series . You 've got all the luxury extras , like realistic toes and a slide-back sunroof head . Why are you looking at me like that ? Sorry . Stare mode cancel . It 's just you have really amazing eyes . Well ... they 're just the old 579s with the automatic 15F-stop cornea . I could pop them out and you could borrow them . Heck . What a jerky thing to say . I don 't believe you would ever say anything jerky . - Really ? - Really . Wow . Uh , listen , I ... I know this will sound like a corny line , but do you know that the configuration of your features is extraordinarily apposite ? - You really know all the lines . - No , I really mean it . The way the light catches your head - it 's enchanting . - I am Kryten . - You already said . Oh , yes . You must think me as stupid as a photocopier . So , where are the crew ? What happened here ? Kryten , do you believe in advanced mutual compatibility on the basis of a primary initial ident ? What humans call " love at first sight " ? That would be an adequate synonym . Until a moment ago , I 'd have said the probability was zero squared . - And now ? - Uh ... This gantry is unstable . I suggest you hang on to me . Oh , what is that fragrance ? It smells divine . - WD-40 . - I knew it . I knew it . I use it on my neck hinges too . Kryten , this shouldn 't be happening . Do you feel it too ? You mean the 93.72 % compatibility factor ? - I make it 93.75 . - Oh , yes . I forgot to carry the three . - Say it . Say the words . - It sounds ridiculous from a mechanoid . - Then say them in machine language . - OK . In Z80012 , using hex rather than binary , and converting to a basic ASC2 code , Camille , I think I E5-A9-08-B7 you . - You really mean that ? - Camille , I 'd do anything for you . I 'd compute a three-million-digit prime number to make you happy . I 'd evaluate pi to infinity to make you smile . Oh , Kryten . You make the most romantic calculations . Kryten , can you read me ? What 's happening ? - There are others ? - Yes , why ? - I can 't meet them . - What do you mean ? Two of us alone could work . Don 't make me explain . But this whole planet is about to blow . I can 't meet your shipmates . Trust me . But you 'll like them . Well , some of them . Well , one of them ... maybe . Sir . I 'm making my way back . - What 's kept you ? - I 've found a survivor . We 're coming in . Kryten , don 't make me do this . I 'm begging you . Just relax . Everything 's going to be fine . Mr Rimmer , sir ? - Where the smeg have you been ? - Mr Rimmer , Camille . Camille , Second Tech Rimmer . She saved my life , sir . Yes , well ... Howdy . - Howdy . - You see ? I knew you 'd get along . Well , I 'd better start the engines and get us clear of the impact zone . - I 'll come with you . - No , no . You stay and get acquainted . Can I get you anything ... or anything ? No . No , no . I 'm fine , thanks . I can 't believe I 've met another hologram after all these years . - Yes . I was Second Technician on that crate . - That 's what I am . I wanted to go further , but I 'm a dope in exams . Me too . So , er ... what do they call you ? Well , my first name is Arnold , but the guys generally call me ... Duke . - Duke ? - Yes , well ... not absolutely all the time . In fact , sometimes months elapse without being called " Duke " at all . So don 't call me " Duke " in front of anyone ... because they might have forgotten ... that they call me " Duke " . Sorry , I 'm no good at small talk . - Oh , I think you 're perfectly charming . - Do you ? Well , thank you . No one 's ever said I was charming before . They 've said , " Rimmer , you 're a total git , " but never charming , no . - Well , I think you 're very charming . - Really ? Very , VERY charming . Well , thank you . Um ... thank you . I 'd just better go and see how er ... Kryten 's getting on . Excusez-moi . - She 's quite something , isn 't she , sir ? - She 's enchanting . - You think so ? - She 's got everything - style , taste , poise ... - She 's absolutely lovely . - Oh , I 'm so glad you think so , sir . I 'll tell you , I think there 's romance in the air . You sly old dog , Krytie ! I think you 're right . Sure , her nose is a little loose , but that 's just cute . I 'll tell you something . She 's so like my sister-in-law Janine , it 's untrue . Camille looks like your sister-in-law ? What happened ? Was she involved in a car accident ? Who ? Janine ? No , she was a model . - And she looked like Camille ? - Absolutely . The resemblance is uncanny . What did she model ? Spark plugs ? - I happen to think she 's very attractive . - You do ? ! - Certainly . - Do you think I 'm attractive ? You ? Of course not . You look like a giant half-chewed rubber-tipped pencil . Well , think what the heck you like , because some people in this big old cosmos think I 'm pretty amazing-looking , especially in the eye department , I thank you so very much . You 're back . I heard . - Ah , sir , meet Camille . - Hi . I 'll go and prepare your quarters . The penthouse suite on A Deck should suffice . Well , this looks fine . If you remove your clothes , we 'll begin the examination . Sorry . Dave Lister , ship 's surgeon . - You 're a surgeon ? - Well , I 'm not fully qualified , but I 've seen every episode of " St Elsewhere " . If you like , we can dispense with the examination and go straight for the malpractice . So relax , and I 'll turn on the laughing gas . Giggles or guffaws ? It 's all the same to me . Something tells me you 're not a doctor . What gave it away ? The fact that I 've gone fully ten seconds without patronising you ? This is weird . The last two humans in an infinite cosmos and we bump into each other . - Yeah , it is weird , isn 't it ? - We have an awesome responsibility . - We do ? - Yeah . Sure we do . To rebuild the human race ... as quickly as possible . Do you wanna start now or clean your teeth first ? And they say romance is dead . The prospect of making love to a stranger is just as galling to me . We 've got to be professional about this , totally clinical and unemotional . So just lie back and I 'll slip into my Spiderman costume . Ah , Listy . I see you 've met our ravishing guest . - Camille , have you seen Kryten ? - He went up to A Deck . Thanks muchly . Oh , Camille ... It 's just a silly thought , really , but I thought after you 've settled in , we could pop up to the projection room and I could talk you through my photo collection of 20th-century telegraph poles . Yeah , or if you fancy a more entertaining time , you can just let him shoot you through the head . As it happens , Listy , Camille is into telegraph poles as much as I am , especially the 1952 Phase Fours with the triple-reinforced wire . - What ? You 're into telegraph poles ? - Of course not . You see ? And she 's also a big fan of Reggie Wilson . - What ? You like Hammond organ music ? ! - It 's mindless pap . Absolutely amazing , eh ? Reggie Wilson , telegraph poles ... It 's uncanny how much we 've got in common . - Are you OK , Rimmer ? - Never better . Where is he ? A Deck ? Ciao for now . - What was all that about ? - What about ? You were saying one thing and Rimmer was hearing another . How do you do that ? Well , you 'd probably have worked it out eventually . I 'm a Pleasure GELF . Hey , what 's going on , buddy ? Eraserhead says she 's a mechanoid and Captain Sadness says she 's a hologram . Well , she 's both and neither . She 's a GELF . - GELF ? - Yeah . A Genetically Engineered Life Form . She 's a Pleasure GELF , created to be everyone 's perfect companion . Everyone perceives her differently . You see what you wanna see , what you most desire . Are you telling me I 'll see my perfect mate ? Mmm , yeah , and she 'll fall instantly in love with you . What exquisite treasure of loveliness lies behind those doors ? Knowing you , a 6ft Valkyrie warrior in scanty armour with a cleavage you can ski down . Stop . You 're making me dribble . Well , here goes . Hi , buddy . - You 're me . - Who else ? - I 'm the object of my own desire ? - Can you think of anyone more deserving ? Well , if you put it like that , I guess you 're right . Damn my vanity ! Ooow ! - What did you see ? - Oh , just some gorgeous chunk of loveliness . - Come on . - Ooh , what a body ! - What did you see ? - My legs are still shaking . - Cat , what did you see ? - Someone get me a brandy ! Well , I should 've guessed . It was just too strange , actually meeting someone who didn 't want to vomit over me in loathing and disgust . Don 't take it so personally , sir . We all feel foolish , used , chewed up and spat out . Look , she didn 't mean any harm . She can 't control how we see her . She 's ... a mirror for our obsessions . - Holly , what did you see ? - Nothing . I don 't have any desires . Either that , or me screen was foggy . I guess I owe you all an apology . Sorry , Dave . Sorry , Duke . - Sorry , buddy . - Heartbreaker ! I told you it wouldn 't work , Kryten , if there were others . You 're hurt the most . You 're not used to these emotions . - Why did you lie to me ? - I felt something I 'd never felt before . I knew if you saw the real me you 'd be repelled . Well , try me . Turn away and I 'll change to what I really am . I 'm ready , - This is what I really look like , - Oh . - What do you think ? - Well , I think you look ... really nice . Nice ? She looks like something that dropped out of the Sphinx 's nose ! He 's right , I 'm just a huge green blob , True , but as huge green blobs go , you 're really cute . - I don 't believe you , - OK , you 'll never make the cover of " Vogue " , but , hey , neither will I. - I think you 're really sweet . - You 're lying , - I can 't lie . I 'm a mechanoid . - You really don 't think I 'm repulsive ? Of course not . There 's some humans not as attractive as you . Take Karl Malden , and he was a famous actor . You think this changes anything ? Camille , I 'd be grateful if you joined me for dinner tonight . - You mean that ? - Parrot 's Bar . I 'll meet you there at eight . Flats or heels ? I can 't believe he 's really going through with this . Look , if Kryten wants to take an amorphous green blob for a discreet tete-a-tentacle , - I say good luck to him . - Me too . We all react differently . When Steve McQueen met the Blob , he tried to kill it . He probably never thought of taking it to a restaurant . I know . They should go to a sushi bar . At least the food won 't look better than his date . Sir . I respect your sense of dress more than anything , and I 'd really appreciate your opinion of this outfit . Kryten , if I was going out with a ball of slime , that 's how I 'd dress . Thank you , sir . That means a lot to me . Well ... don 't wait up ! - Isn 't this enchanting ? - Oh , Kryten , - Could we make it , you and I ? - It 's the old , old story . Droid meets droid . Droid becomes chameleon . Droid loses chameleon . Chameleon becomes blob . Droid gets blob back again . - It 's a classic tale . - A toast , my love , To us , " THE BLUE DANUBE " ) " AS TIME GOES BY " ) " Casablanca . " What a movie . I must have seen it a thousand times . Lister used it as part of my course . It 's littered with examples of how lying can be noble . From now on , my angel , " Casablanca " will be our movie , and ... Sorry to gooseberry , Kryten , but we 've got a visitor . He wants to see Camille . I was going to tell you , Kryten , Truly I was , - You have a husband ? ! - We 're androgynous , but I suppose I do , Hector has a brilliant mind , He 's worked on an antidote for our condition for years , - Hector 's a blob too ? - We 're both blobs , Kryten , I left him long ago , I thought he 'd given up looking , - He must really thi nk a lot of you . - I guess , - What will you do ? - I 'll tell him I met someone else , I 'm going to tell him I 'm staying here with you , Mr Lister , would you take Camille 's bag on board ? - Certainly , Kryten . Anything you say . - Why my bag , Kryten ? You 're getting on that craft with Hector where you belong . - No , Kryten , - Listen to me . Do you know what you 've got to look forward to here ? - You 're saying this to make me go , - You belong to Hector . You 're part of his work . If you don 't get on that craft , you 'll regret it , maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon and for the rest of your life . - What about us ? - We 'll always have Parrot 's . - Oh , Kryten , - I 'm no good at being noble , kid . The problems of two blobs and a droid don 't amount to a hill of beans in this cosmos . Are you ready , Camille ? I 'm ready , Goodbye , Kryten , God bless you , - You were lying , Kryten . - Yes , but it was her best shot at happiness . It 's the old , old story . Droid meets droid . Droid becomes chameleon . Droid loses chameleon . Chameleon turns into blob . Droid gets blob back . Blob meets blob . Blob goes off with blob . Droid loses blob , chameleon and droid . How many times have we seen that story ? - I suppose you 're gonna blame me . - Yes , I am . Without your bananas , movies and aardvarks , none of this could have happened . You 're a complete and total smeghead . Brutal , Kryten . You just insulted me . Yes . I can lie , cheat AND be offensive now . Kryten , this could be the start of a beautiful friendship . # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

 Last time on Stephen King 's Golden Years ... Harlan Williams , tech number 10884 . Custodian third . Scientific history , gentlemen . You were here . The janitor is growing younger . That means that the effects are much more powerful than we had thought . Would you like to see the janitor ? Yes . At once . Of course . Are you joking ? There must be tests . I want to go get the janitor and his wife . I want them clear . Today , you 're 65 . You 'll have a birthday again in a week and you 'll be 60 . And then , a few days after that , you 'll be 55 . Because it 's not slowing down . We 've got 150 agents , from Pennsylvania to Upstate New York . We 'll have another 150 by noon . Harlan thinks we should be heading the other way . He doesn 't want to involve Francie . - Who 's that ? - Our daughter . Leave Francie out of this . - Your instructions ? - Don 't hit the old man . I just don 't want to be separated from you , Harl . It feels wrong . Commence primary sequence , gentlemen . He found a way to turn back the clock . To make living tissues get younger . And that 's what 's happening to Harlan ? Regeneration is just a cover . For what ? I don 't know . It 's him . It 's all ' cause of him . What 's the word ? It 's not good . Where 's the old man 's file ? They locked me out of the databank . I can still get the information . It 's going to take more time . - That 's too bad . - What are you doing ? - You haven 't got more time . - What are you ... ? Did you think I was going to kill you ? I can 't do that . It 's against regulations . - Come on . - Where are we going ? I might have found someone that 'll help find the old man . Oh , good . That 's good , because ... I feel real bad that I ... I blew this . - Strike one , Burton . - What ? Strike one . I started doing it , because my wife insisted . She thought it would help our marriage . Only once a week is all we ever did it . Saturday night . I didn 't really mind , because I found out I could do it and think of other things at the same time . Data systems , spreadsheets , projections . Things like that . But then one night , she said she needed to do it more than once a week . - Really ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry . I tried . But I cannot do it three times a week . - The last time I did it was church camp . - Yeah , but ... Look , I ... I feel guilty , but ... I 'd rather be here than with her . If you hate square dancing so much , why don 't you tell her ? - How does it look ? - Should have told me you were coming . - This is going to take a while . - How long ? You guys can hang out in the pilots ' room . I 'll let you know when it 's ready . You know , you 're right . I hate square dancing . I 've always hated it . When we get home , I 'm going to tell my wife . She didn 't make you wear spurs , did she ? Of course , God ... is the grand watchmaker . We 're all just ticking away here . Tick , tick , tick , tick , tick . Tick , tick . Tick , tick , tick , tick , tick , tick , tick . I swear , this used to be bigger . ... to bring you this special bulletin . An earthquake has been reported in northeastern Illinois . According to local reports , it was a minor tremor . No injuries were reported , but power in the area was disrupted - for about 15 minutes . - Thanks . And now back to more music on your favourite radio station . - Are you sure you 're all right ? - Yes , I 'm just tired . - I 'm very tired . - We should get on the bus . - I want to call Francie . - There really isn 't time . We have to go . I 'm going to call my daughter ! Gina , the more time we spend standing here , the more chance there is of someone spotting us . We 'll be there in an hour . Please . I 'll give you one of my cupcakes . - All right . - Yeah . You hang on . It 's only an hour . Sure this is the right place ? Well , the manager said : " Look for the Christmas lights . " - God , that offends me . - What ? People who keep their Christmas lights up year round . There ought to be a law against that . - A law ? - And plastic Christmas trees ... There 's no accounting for taste , Burton . Remember that . Wait in the car . - But I thought I would ... - Wait in the car ! I 'll wait in the car . Scrooge . Hey , Mr Andrews . How are you doing ? Come on in . Gentlemen , I want you all to know how important this evening 's work is to me . To us all , really . I 'm proud of this team . You 've done an admirable job . Admirable . I know I 've asked a lot from you . Just as you have asked a lot from yourselves . Perhaps that 's why I feel so close to each and every one of you . As though we were ... a family . Part of the family of scientific man . I know we 've had our rough moments , but ... nothing in this world is accomplished without human sacrifice . I think you understand that . Don 't you , Mr ... Mr ... - It 's Yaniger , Sir . - Yeah , well . Yeah . But when this is all over , you 'll understand . We really have accomplished something here . Gentlemen ... I wish you well . Good luck to us all . To your stations . Might fine . Might pretty ... I 'm hoping to move on to bigger animals . But they cost more to do . Unless you just do the head . That 's called a " head mount " in the trade . It 's coming up in lesson six . Well , this is all very , very interesting , Billy . But I came here , because I need your help . - You do ? - Let 's sit down . - Actually , Harlan needs your help . - He does ? Well , you just name it . I 'd do anything for old Harlan . That 's good , as what we 're discussing here is a serious matter . - Is he in some kind of trouble ? - No . He 's very sick , but he doesn 't realise it . - What 's he got ? - I don 't know . It 's something with " itis " on the end of it . - I can 't remember those big words . - Me , either . I think they use them just to confuse us . Yeah . Ain 't that the truth . The doctors want him back very soon . They want to start treatment right away . What can I do to help ? We think he 's gone to visit relatives . Did Harlan ever talk with you about his family ? Sure , all the time . He even showed me pictures when he went to visit them . Would you know their names or where they might live ? - Billy ? - What ? - Their names . Where they live . - Who ? Harlan 's family . Let 's see ... He has two boys and a girl . - Billy ? - No . There 's Douglas Williams . He lives ... It 's that city where they 've got the thing . - What thing ? - The thing . It goes like this . A big arch ? I think they 've got them big horses there , too . I think they 're called ... Trivesdales . - St. Louis . - That 's it . What about the others ? Well , there 's Thomas , who lives in ... It 's where they 've got this parade every year . Where they make them floats out of flowers . - Pasadena . - Yeah , that 's it . You 're really good at these cities , Mr Andrews . - What about the girl ? - She lives in Chicago . She 's got a seeing eye dog named Whitney . - She 's blind ? - Yep . - Do you know what her name is ? - Whitney . No , Billy . The daughter . What 's the daughter 's name ? - Billy ... - I 'm thinking . What 's the daughter 's name ? Francesca . Francesca Williams . Thank you , Billy . Thank you very much . Sure . Want to borrow one of these comics ? No , thanks . This is Chicago . Please check the overhead racks . Be sure to take all your personal belongings . We 'll wait . - I thought you said we were in a hurry . - I 'll tell you when . - What are you looking for ? - A way to get out of here . - What 's the matter with the door ? - Do you see that man ? I 'm almost positive he 's Shop . - Excuse me , fellas . - Yes , Ma 'am . - Do you think you could do me a favour ? - Sure . Do you see that man reading the newspaper over there ? Buddy , how you doing ? I 'd like to have a talk with you . Let go of me . Out of the way . I heard you hit a lady . How about if I hit you , Bozo ? - Let go of me ! - He 's got a gun ! - He 's got a gun . Call the police ! - I am the police ! - There 's an ID in my pocket . - Police ! - Hold him . - Just find out if he is a cop . All right ? - Let go ! - Hold up . He is . He 's a cop , man . I 'm sorry , Sir , but that lady on the bus ... - She said you were a ... - The lady on the bus ! Come on , what did you do ? Die on me , or what ? - Hurry ! Yes , I 'm here . - I 'm sorry I took so long . But I have the address for you now . - Burton ! - Francesca Williams . - Are you absolutely sure it 's her ? - It 's got to be her . I 've got a medical insurance notation that says she 's blind . Okay , what 's her address ? I should caution you . We 're not supposed to have access to those records . Would you just give me the damn address , please ? It 's 895 Clerk Street . Got it . What 's the word ? The word is that Francesca Williams lives at 895 Clerk Street . - That 's where they 're going . - So are we . Let 's go . Francie ? It 's your mom . Open up . - I guess she 's at work . - Do you have that number ? No , she changes jobs a lot . Will you excuse me ? Keep an eye out , will you ? You 're not going to break in here ? After you . - Where did you learn to do that ? - Graduate school . Why did you turn off the light ? I don 't want anything to look different . Just in case ... You think Francie turns on the light when she comes in ? - I know she does . - Fine . She wants everybody to know that there 's somebody just like them living here . Besides , it keeps the burglars away . I 'm going to look in the kitchen and see if there 's anything to eat . Oh , yes . This certainly is Francie 's apartment . No food . I 'm too tired to eat . You take the bedroom . I 'll take the couch . I think I 'll wait up for Harlan . He may not show up tonight . He 's not due until tomorrow . He 'll be here . What if he got tired and stopped off someplace ? You need some sleep . We all do . Well , I 'll make myself a cup of tea . After I 've had my tea , I 'll go to bed . - You promise ? - I promise . Francie likes fresh air at night . Oh , please , God . Okay . Please . Would you say that again ? I didn 't quite understand you . As of this evening 's test run , we 're through level four and we 've achieved 80 % power . Yes . I need authorisation from Jude Andrews before we continue . - So what is the problem ? - He 's not here . So ? What 's the problem ? We can 't continue without his consent . We 'll have to stop at level four . We 're not stopping anything . Get back to your post , at once . That is a direct order , Mister . Will someone assume Mr Yaniger 's position at the control board ? With all due respect , Doctor ... None of us really want to disobey Mr Andrews ' orders . What about my orders ? Who do you think is running this show , anyway ? - Jude Andrews is , Sir . - Mr Yaniger ... Get back to your post or get out ! I don 't have time for this . Please , Doctor . We 're concerned for our personal safety . This is mutiny . Plain and simple . - I will see you hang for it . - I 'm following orders . Set me adrift in the middle of my most important voyage , will you ? That 's not the case . I can cross the darkness on my own , thank you very much . Unassisted . Unfettered by your petty loyalties and your treasonous behaviour . Shove off . - What ? - You heard me . Get out ! Now ! Get out . All of you ! Clear this room , at once . Get out ! Get out of my sight . Your lack of courage disgusts me . Get out . Out ! You 're all a bunch of fraidy cats . Get out . Out ! This is my experiment . My experiment . My experiment ! My experiment ! Mine ! If you won 't help me , I 'll find somebody who will . I will proceed , even if I have to do everything myself . If you won 't help me , I 'll find somebody who will ! Mine ! That 's right . 4-0-2-5 . It 's collect . My name ? My name is ... I 'm sorry . I 'll try again later . What can I get for you , honey ? - Steak and eggs . - Oh , " steak and eggs . " How would you like your eggs , sweetie ? - Sunny side up . - " Sunny side up . " - Oh , no . - What 's the matter ? I don 't use sugar . I ... - I haven 't since I was ... - Since you were what ? I just stopped using it . - Let me get you another cup . - No , that 's all right . You sure ? - It tastes pretty good . - You like sweet things ? Well , that depends on what it is . Well , I 've got the best hot cross buns in town . You interested ? Yeah ... Well ... Let 's see how I feel after the steak . You save some room . What the hell 's going on ? Oh , no ! We 're having an earthquake ! Who 's there ? I know someone 's there . You 'd better speak up . This is a trained attack dog . - I 'm ready when he is . - Who ... Who are you ? - Francie , honey . It 's Mama . - Mom ! - Baby , am I glad to see you . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm sorry we didn 't call first . - Who are you ? Terry Spann , Head of Security at the plant where your father works . - Is Dad here ? - Dad 's on his way . What 's going on , Mom ? Some people are trying to find your mother and father . And ... I 'm trying to stop them from doing that . - Are you in some kind of trouble ? - It 's hard to explain ... I 'm not talking to you , lady , but to my mother . She can speak for herself . Are you in trouble , Mom ? We haven 't done anything wrong , if that 's what you mean . - But we did steal a car . - You stole a car ? - Actually , it was a hearse . - You stole a hearse ? And a police car . Francie , would you mind if I used your shower ? I smell like a dog . Well , that 's because you were sleeping in Whitney 's bed . Francie won 't mind . You get cleaned up and I 'll fix us all something to eat . - There is food in this bag , isn 't there ? - Yes , Mother . If anybody knocks on the door , don 't answer it . Come and get me . - Are you still working the night shift ? - No . I 've been out dancing with Whitney . Mom , what the hell is going on ? - Who is that woman ? - She 's a friend . - Are you sure ? - I trust her . - Mom , you and Dad trust everybody . - Not anymore . Let 's start at the top . Why are there people after you ? Well , it 's hard to explain . Try , Mom . I 'm not very good at charades . Well , it 's complicated . Every time I talk about it , it sounds so crazy . What 's that mean ? We 'd better wait until your father comes . Do you have an apron somewhere ? That 's him . Mr Andrews , I can 't tell you how much we 're looking forward ... - Where 's the car ? - Outside . - Do you know where this is ? - Yes , Sir . - How far ? - About 40 minutes , I 'd say . You get us there in half an hour . Let 's go . Why don 't I just call Falco Plains and find out who you are ? They 're the last people you should contact . Then who can I call ? Take my word for it . I 'm trying to help your mother and father . - Why should I believe you ? - They do . They 'll believe anybody as long as they act sincere enough . Nice way to talk about your parents . My mother and father and I are very up-front with each other . More than I can say for you . - I 'm telling you all you need to know . - Don 't patronise me . I 'm not . I 'm not , and I do understand what you must be feeling . You 're shining me and I don 't like it . - I 'll call Falco Plains . - I wish you wouldn 't . I 'd like to keep you out of this . It 's for your own protection . You lie very well . Is it compulsive or did you have some professional training ? Look , I don 't give a rat 's arse what you think about me . - But no phone calls . - Give me the phone . You 'd sign your mother 's death warrant and be responsible for your father disappearing . - I don 't believe that . - And if they think you know too much , you 'll find yourself a guest of the US government . They 'll put you in a nice , safe place for the rest of your life . - Give me the phone ! - Come on ! Stop it . Stop it , both of you . Gina , are you all right ? - I 'm fine . - You look pale . It 's the heat in there . I 'm fine . If you two stopped arguing , I 'd feel a lot better . - Mom , I just wanted to call ... - Whatever we do , it 's up to Harlan and me to decide . Not you . Not Terry . Whenever he gets here ... Whitney ! Find out who it is . - Who is it ? - Open up , it 's your dad . - Dad ! - Francie . It 's only me . - Where 's your mom ? - She 's here . She got in last night . Glad she 's all right . How are you ? I 'm fine . What the hell is going on ? - I 'll tell you later . - Oh , thank God . - I didn 't sleep a wink . - I told you I 'd be here . Well , Terry . - How are we doing ? - Pretty good , for now . I don 't think we should push our luck . We can 't stay here . Well , we 're not leaving until everybody has something to eat . I 'll give her a hand . - Are you all right , Dad ? - I 'm fine , Francie . It 's just ... Something 's happening to me . Dad , it 's your face . It 's everything , Francie . - It seems I 'm getting younger . - What ? - You 're kidding . - No . Dad ... - It 's serious , isn 't it ? - It 's finally getting through to you . - That 's hopeful . - Spare me the smart mouth , okay ? Look who 's talking . A blind , female Don Rickles . Just what the hell do you mean by that ? I mean you have a lousy attitude . You come in here , dragging my mother . My father shows up with his face changed . It 's like touching a stranger . You tell me that all the cops in Chicago and government spooks are after him . And you have the nerve to bitch about my attitude ? - Just what is your problem ? - Right now , you are . You and my idiot father . I should be used to this . He has been putting his own weird backspin on things all his life . Him and his projects . Him and his big ideas . His projects and his big ideas have kept him a janitor all his life . The only thing he was ever good at is keeping my mom married to him . Somebody ought to wash your mouth with soap . Oh , just get off your high horse , lady . What 's he gotten her into ? What did he do ? Well , let 's see . He was in the bathroom . Probably planning further degradation of your mom . There was an explosion . He got the fire extinguisher to see if he could help . And this man ... This crazy man hit him and knocked him down . When Harlan was getting up , there was another explosion and he was covered in magic , green dust . He turned into Peter Pan . That okay ? That make you happy ? Or is he still not a jerk enough to please you ? - Stop it . - Okay . But let me tell you one thing . Your mother and father really love each other , Francie . They 'd die for one another . And for you , too . And if you miss that , you really can 't see anything . I love him . Of course I do . You just don 't know what it was like to grow up with Harlan Ethan Williams as a father . He was always ... in things . The Little League , Boy 's Club , the ... PAL Fund for the Homeless . He just never knew how dark the world could be for a little blind girl . Then when the protests started and I ... I moved to Chicago ... - He was angry ? - He was glad ! They both were . But my father was ecstatic . He gave you nothing to rebel against . - Is that what it boils down to ? - Oh ... It 's never that simple . In most families , the boiling point is too high . I want to apologise , Miss Spann . I think I had you wrong . Apology accepted , with thanks . Part of the problem is me . I 've got this ... allergy problem . It goes back to the summer of ' 68 . - Pigs ? - That 's the one . You don 't have to worry about sneezing around me . I gave up my snout last week . My Dad ... Is he really getting younger ? Yeah , he really is . Dear God . - What are you doing ? - I 'm packing . I don 't know where you think you 're going , but I 'm going with you . I don 't know how to tell you this , but ... You 're blind and there are bad guys after us . Don 't worry about me , Miss Spann . I 've been dealing with both for a long time . Call me Terry . - The plane 's Shop . - How can you tell ? Damned pilot 's taking up two parking places . That 's what autopilot 's made for . - Didn 't you know that ? - No . You 're kidding , right ? What do you think those stewardesses are doing up there ? Flying the plane ? - But how can they ... There 's no room . - It 's easy . - I could show you . - Excuse me . Who owns that small jet ? - Is there a problem ? - No , I wanted to talk to the pilot . - I 'm the pilot . What is it ? - Your passenger list . - That 's classified information , General . - Classified , is it ? You know what this is ? That 's a pretty persuasive argument to declassify some information . Smart boy . Who 'd you bring in ? Jude Andrews and an operations officer by the name of Burton . They were met by two other agents here . - That 's it ? - That 's it . Could you get that thing out of my face ... please ? If he moves , shoot him . What ? Great . Just great . - Are they locals ? - Chicago 's finest . We haven 't got time for this . We can put them in here for now . Give me the keys . Shouldn 't ... Shouldn 't we tie them up ? I don 't think they 're going to try and get away . I 'll be back in a couple of hours . If I 'm not back by then , get in the plane . There are guns in the back seat . I suggest you arm yourself . And then what ? I 'll call you on the jet 's airphonelobby and let you know what to do . Don 't worry about it , Major . We 'll win this one . We have a lot of good players on our team . - And they 've got Jude Andrews . - Yeah . - Where did you get this ? Disneyland ? - Washington . DSA . Can 't you read ? A real joker , huh ? A real wise guy , huh ? I haven 't got time for this Joe Friday routine . You try that again and I 'll drag your butt to Michigan Avenue Station , face down . Don 't move ! - Officer , we 're on a national mission ... - You shut up , too ! Look , all I know is you were speeding . You 've got a cache of illegal weapons . And you 've got an ID from someplace I 've never heard of . If you ever read more than a comic book , you might learn something . - Don 't push your luck , butt-head . - All right . Let them go . They 're who they say they are . All right . Sorry for the mix-up , gentlemen . You 're free to go . Hey . No hard feelings , huh ? If your superiors had let us know you were in town , this could have been avoided . If you weren 't such a schmuck , this could have been avoided . If you want to swear out a complaint , be my guest . I don 't know why you 're bothering , Mother . Habit , I guess . Can 't leave a dirty kitchen . We 're leaving as soon as Francie 's packed . Why is she packing ? She wants to come with us . Well , I hope you told her " no " . You don 't tell Francie anything . Thought you 'd have learned that by now . It 's all going to work out , Gina . You 'll see . Yes . We 've had a good life . We 've raised three good children . I couldn 't ask for more . Would you stop talking like it 's over ? Because it 's not . Harlan , I 've been thinking that maybe I ought to stay here . I 'm only going to slow you down . I 'm not going to leave you behind , Gina . So you can just stop . Get back . Wait . Now . - Who is it ? - Crewes . Open up . - Louis . Why am I happy to see you ? - Hi , Terry . It 's mutual . - Who is this guy ? - That 's General Crewes . - What are you doing here ? - Just lending a hand , Mrs Williams . - How 'd you find us ? - Doesn 't matter . We have to leave now . Andrews knows you 're here . Surprised he isn 't here . Okay , let 's go . We 'll steal a car from the garage . You don 't have to do that . I 've got a car we can use . - You do ? - Yeah . If it 's there . It belongs to my neighbour . She 's always losing her keys , so she gave me a spare set . You mind if I drive ? Let 's go . Get your stuff . We 're moving out . They still up there ? I want to go up alone . Anybody have any objections ? I want one man in the lobby , one out here . I want you two to go with Burton down underground . Let 's go . Check the stairwell . - It 's the second car from the end . - Go , go , go , go , go ! Damn it , Whitney . Stop it ! Don 't blame him . I was going to bark myself . Jude , come in ! Jude , come in ! - Jude here . - They 're in the garage . - We 've got them pinned down . - I 'm on my way . Take the next one . Harlan . Harlan . I move up . I cover you . You come to me . We 'll leap-frog all the way to the car . - You want me to drive ? - If they get me , you 'll have the keys . Move up ! Go ! This is too easy . Whitney ! Whitney ! Whitney ! Whitney ! Whitney ! Give it up , Terry . It 's over . I want the old man and I want you . - Everybody else can go . - I 'll get that son of a bitch . Francie , listen . Can you make it to your friend 's car in the dark ? What do you mean ? For me it 's always dark . - What will you do ? - Cover me . I 'll blow the lights . Listen to me . Francie first . Then Harlan , Gina and you . - I 'll follow in the rear . - Give me your hand , Dad . Hold your fire ! Very good , Terry . Very smart . I can still hear you . I don 't have to see you to stop you . Just hit a leg . Or maybe a kneecap . Let 's go , man . Go ! Jude ! Get out ! - Stay down ! - Move it ! Damn it ! We flushed them out . Now we have to run them down . Cover the city . Bus terminals , bridges , airport , everything . It 's being done . I want you to call the Chicago station chief . Have him alert all the blue list agents . - What 's that ? - Hypes . Whores . Ageing hippies . You 'd be surprised how useful some of them can be . We have to get rid of this car . Wait here . Louis and I will be back in ten minutes . You give us ten minutes . If we don 't come back , you 're on your own .

[ alarm sounding ] - I don 't like you , volker . In fact , I 've never liked you . - Oh . - and I 'm not going to recommend you to the parole board . If you ever wanna get off this rock , you better consider a serious attitude adjustment . - Now why would I wanna do that . I love this rock . It 's my home . - You know what , volker ? I 'm havin ' a bad day . You know why , volker ? 'cause you 're givin me a headache ! - That 's the general idea . - Wayla , can you ask Dr. Elliss to come up here when we 're through ? - Yes , sir . - What 's the matter , bronkov ? You like you could use a vacation . - Get this wise guy outta here . This interview is over . - Thanks . Sit down , Warden- - Relax . Take it easy- - Take it easy . I 'm in control now . - Prisoner number 1-9-7 , wyndam derrit , aka houdini , for transfer to asteroid a-five . - Wait a minute- - This ain 't houdini . - What do you mean ? - Yes , Officer , what do you mean ? - Shut up ! No way is this little guy the most notorious escape artist on altor . - Maybe I 'm not houdini . Hey , maybe the real houdini 's escaped . - Shut up- - Just sign the form . And Hey , good luck . - Thanks . The more I 've been thinking about this , I 'm sure I 'm not houdini . - Yeah , well , you can deal with your little identity crisis when you get to the rock . - Hold on a second , orin . All right , houdini , give it back . - What ? - What you got in your hand , give it back ! Hair restorer ! - Hey- - Give me that ! - Hey , Officer .

Oh , my , Sawyer sends a deep shot to left . It 's goin ' - - it 's gone ! Touch ' em all , baby ! The yankees take the series ! - Dream on , man . If the yankees take the series , it 'll be because of the pitching , not the hitting . - Whoa-Whoa- - " if the yankees win " ? - Okay , okay , when , when . - Now you 're talkin ' . - Yeah , but what are you talking about ? - Baseball , man . - Oh , yeah . That 's that stupid earth game where they stand around doing nothing for three hours ? - Fredo , we are talking about the seventh game of the world series here . - and we are gonna be watchin ' it . - Yes ! - Yes ! - Weird . - a month long trial at demeter 's high court ended today with a conviction of one of the city 's most notorious crime bosses . Ariset Gagnon , guilty of extortion , blackmail , and criminal conspiracy . Due to his advanced age and deteriorating health , the court has ordered that Gagnon undergo a complete physical check up before being transferred to asteroid a-five , a maximum security penitentiary known as " the rock . " - Captain ? - How 's it goin ' there , took ? - Well , it looks like we 're gonna run a little late , sir . This medical thing came out of nowhere . - All right . I 'll reschedule the transfer at this end . You stay with Gagnon . - Yes , sir . - Stop , castle . Why don 't you come watch the world series with us ? That 's right- - I forgot . You have to work , huh ? Oh , come on , where 's your sense of humor , huh ? That altorian flu thing 's still got ya , huh ? Tell ya what , just take the day off . - don 't patronize me , Jack- - I can look after myself . - Haldane , the captain wants to see us in his office . - I got a bad feeling about this . Oh , come on , captain- - you can 't be serious ! Not today ! - Captain , if we take houdini to the rock , we 're gonna be missin the baseball game . - Baseball ? - Yeah . - Oh , yeah . Stupid earth game where you stand around doing nothin for three hours . - Captain , this is important . - and so is the reputation of this precinct , I hope ! I want houdini out of here before he even thinks of escaping ! - Weren 't took and castle supposed to be taking him with Gagnon ? - Gagnon 's tied up in a medical . Took 's still with him . I don 't want to wait any longer . I 've made up my mind ! Thanks , fellas ! - You 're welcome . - whatever it is , I didn 't do it . - No , that 's where you 're wrong . I 'm missing the biggest baseball game of the year 'cause of you . - Baseball . Oh , yeah , I 've heard of that . Isn 't that the stupid earth game- - - Shut up ! - What happened , haldane ? Did podly spoil your fun ? - I don 't wanna talk about it . - Aw , come on , why don 't you just take the day off ? - Why don 't you talk to Brogan about that ? He and Matt have been plannin ' this for weeks . - Uh , no , Matt , the signal won 't be a problem , but- - - But ion storms always mess up reception . - Uh-Uh , not super light transmissions , only radio waves . Look , Matt- - - How do you know that ? - It said so in the forecast . - All right , we 're gonna see the yankees kick some serious giants Butt . - Matt- - Uh , Matt , I-I got a little complication here . Hold on a second . - Listen , Brogan , this was supposed to be my assignment . You go home- - I 'll do the run with haldane . - Uh , what about took ? - She 'll find someone else to do the Gagnon run . - You 're not too sick ? - Say " Hi " to Matt . - Matt ? - Yeah ? - Break out the cracker Jacks . - Broke out of prior too , huh ? - Mmm-Hmm . Took me ten hours to get out of that joint , but then I 'm not a strong swimmer . - Yeah , well , it 's not gonna be that easy gettin out of the rock . I 'm tellin ' ya , this place Makes alcatraz look like fabulous cave mountains . - So I 've heard . I like a challenge . - Speaking of challenges , Jack , I bet you can 't keep quiet for the next two hours . - Where 's Brogan ? - I win . Make yourselves at home , boys . This is gonna be a long and Boring ride . - that 's the lot . When volker let 's us out , I say we split this rock . Forget the boss . - Shut up ! Look , the first vehicle we can use is the one the boss 'll be on . You mess with the plan , he 'll kill you . And if he doesn 't , I will ! - And if cranston doesn 't , I will . Any other bright ideas , smike ? How you feelin ' ? - Good . The , uh , antidote works like a charm . How 's the Warden ? - Bronkov ? You won 't be seein ' him no more . Come on , let 's go- - We got company . - I 'm tellin ya , castle , if this is your idea of a long , Boring ride , I can 't wait to see what you call exciting . - You couldn 't begin to handle it . - if I didn 't know better , I 'd swear you two were married . Oh , come on , more trivia . Your turn , Officer haldane . - Okay . All right , all right , all right . Let 's see . Um ... most home runs in a season . [ indistinct ] - Yeah . - You 've gotta be kidding me . Sixty-One , of course , Roger Maris , New York yankees . - All right- - Okay , smart guy . That was easy . Let 's try most Homers national league . - Fifty-Six , Hack Wilson , chicago cubs . - " baseball , I 've heard of that . " Once a conman , always a conman . - don 't worry . We 'll settle our bet when I get outta jail . - Hey , I 'm sorry to spoil your fun , chaps , but I think we better contact the rock . They 're inclined to blow unannounced visitors out of the sky . - Yeah- - I 'm on it . This isn 't gonna be easy . We got major ion interference . - Well , try another frequency ... and hurry up . This is too risky- - I 'm turning back . - Good idea . - No , no . Hold on- - hold on . Just stay calm . I got everything under control . - Asteroid a-five control . Transmit your security verification . - Officers haldane and castle , 88th precinct . We 're transporting prisoner 1-9-7 . - You 're cleared for docking . - Nice talking to you , too , Buddy . Must be a new guy . - Prisoner 1-9-7 ? You moron , that 's not Gagnon ! Oh , great ! You just let in some penny-Ante pick-Pocket and two cops ! - Hey , volker , what 's goin ' on here ? I thought Gagnon was the only scheduled delivery . - The old fool already had one foot in the grave . Maybe he croaked . - Shut up ! He can take care of you from beyond the grave , too , you know ! - Both of you , shut up ! We 've got cops to think about now . - Wow ! Impressive security . Look at all those guards . - Yeah , they 're probably all gettin ' ready to watch the baseball game . - It 's not usually this quiet . - Coffee break . - Oh , whatever . Let 's make this quick . This flu 's making me feel like death warmed up . - Please , after you . - Look at that- - See , chivalry 's not dead . - Sure , but you have to go to prison to find it . Nobody 's here either- - Something 's wrong . There 's always an escort waiting . - Sorry to keep ya . - Yeah , no problem . Why is it so quiet around here ? - Probably the ion storm- - Everyone 's kinda spaced out . - Yeah . Uh , look , I need you to sign for this guy . - Sure . Uh ... wasn 't ariset Gagnon supposed to be on this run . - He 's running late- - He 'll be on the next one . - I 've kinda been lookin forward to Mr. Gagnon 's arrival . - Yeah , well , he 's some piece of work . - Hey , uh , houdini , right ? - That 's right . Watch your back with this guy . There 's more to him than meets the eye . - Officer haldane , after all we 've shared together . - Oh , Harry . Let 's go ! - I don 't think so ! We 'll take the weapons . The multi-Comms , too . I 'm Warden volker . Welcome to the rock . - Hey , I see a new hair . No , that one was there already . - give it a rest , will ya , romek ? - You know , once you start usin ' that stuff , you can never stop , or it 's , uh ... hair today and gone tomorrow . - funny ! A real laugh riot ! - Took ? Where 's Gagnon ? - Oh , a couple of medical guys are bringing him up . Where 's Jane ? - Oh , she left for the rock already with haldane . They went ahead with houdini . I 'm with you on the Gagnon run . Tired ? - No . Fredo , did you ever have feelings about people you 're close to ? - What kind of feelings ? - Like when your wife is sick , and you 're not with her , but you just know it . - Ah , you 're in love . - No . It 's Jane , and it 's not good . - My god- - What have you done ? - You 'll find out soon enough . Okay , hold it right there . Okay , move it . Move it . You , too , wise guy . Breathe easy , folks . - Warden bronkov ! He 's still alive- - Give me some help . - You 're wasting your time . - who are you ? - Elliss . I 'm the prison doctor . - What the hell happened here ? What happened ? - Volker . He released a virus into the ventilation system . - What kind of a virus ? - They modified the altorian flu , so it attacks the central ... Nervous system ... faster . - How fast ? - Symptoms start Soon after exposure . Humans have a little longer . - So what do we expect ? - Headaches , fever ... Then hallucinations ... and paranoia ... then you become comatose ... after that , you 've got about an hour . - Volker has an antidote ? Dr. Elliss , can you hear me ? Doctor ! - Stay with us , doc . - Get away ! - It 's all right . - Come on , doc . - He 's hallucinating . Doctor ! Doctor ! - What a way to go , huh ? - I 'm not ready to go yet . The next time I offer to take Brogan 's place , remind me to have my head examined . - Well ... look at it this way , according to the doc , at least we still have a little quality time left . God , my head feels like a lead balloon . - don 't . - What about you , nothin ' ? - It 's hard to tell . I feel just as bad as I 've been feeling all day . - headache , anything ? - No- - Just this stupid flu . - Yeah , well , maybe it 's protecting you in some way or somethin ' . - Maybe . I 've gotta get outta here . - Yeah , that 's great . And how exactly are we supposed to do that ? - I can help . - How the hell did you get outta there ? - I 'm an escape artist- - That 's what I do . Turn around , please . - What ? - If you want me to help you get outta here , turn around , please . - How the hell did you do that ? - It 's a trade secret . - Come on , Jack , let 's go ! - Where we goin ' ? - the cruiser . Come on , houdini- - Houdini ? - What 'd I do ? - What 's the matter with you ? - I say we take the cop cruiser and get the hell outta here ! - Oh , that would be inconspicuous . - So we 'll spray paint it . Look , Gagnon 's messed up his own plan . We don 't have to wait now . - Shut up ! Get rid of him ! - All right . - What 's he doin ' here ! What are you doin ' here ? - Room service . - Where are the cops ! Houdini , where are the cops ! - Officer Warren , report to sergeant fredo . [ coughing ] - How are the wife and kids lately , podly ? [ coughing ] - So , Gagnon , they didn 't let you go home then ? - Well , you know , in a way they did . I got all my friends on the rock . It 'll be like a reunion . - Some party . Sorry I 'm not going to be there , but I 'm glad we helped to put you and your pals together . - I guess I 'll always owe ya one for that , huh , podly ? - Enjoy the rock , Gagnon ! - I 'll do that . I hear the air 's good out there . - a simple trade . You give me the antidote , I tell you where the cops are . - Yeah . You 'll tell us now , or we 'll kill ya ! - Ooh , scary thought for someone with a terminal disease . - Okay- - All right . Give ' im what he wants . But if you 're lyin ' to me , I 'll tear you apart , piece by piece . - Come on , Jack ! - Whoa ! That stuff 's potent . - Yeah , well , come on , now . Where are they , huh ? Come on- - Come on !

It might even save his life . - How do I do that ? - Think about it . - Janey , I 'm scared . - I know- - me , too . - Hey , you ! How much longer you gonna be keepin ' me here ? - I 'm telling you- - He 's not worth looking for . - All right- - Okay- - Okay- - Okay . Calm down ! - Hey , cranston , I 'm calm . Don 't always be tellin me to calm down . - All right- - All right . All right . Uh , gotta tell Gagnon about this . - It 's a waste of time . The cops 'll be on their last leg . - Yeah , well , that 's volker for ya . I 'm gonna have a lot to tell Gagnon when we get outta here . - No kidding . Okay , let 's go . - Jack 's in a bad way , houdini- - You 've gotta help me . - You pull- - I 'll push . - Come on , Jack . I 've got you . Oh , I 'm sorry . Easy . - Well , Well , well , what a coincidence . - Well , what are you waiting for , volker ? Why don 't you just shoot us now ? - You know , that 's a good question .

[ sirens wailing ] - Castle and haldane , please respond immediately . You know , I don 't think that 's them . - I think you 're right . Haldane 's crazy , but he ain 't that crazy . Descend to ground level , now . - What took you so long ? Follow me . - Ever get the feelin you 're talkin ' to yourself ? - All the time , orin- - All the time . [ sirens wailing ] - Okay , here we go ! - This guy really is nuts ! There 's no way outta that place ! All right , joyride 's over ! Get outta the cruiser , nice and slow ! What the hell ! Where 'd he go ? - Hey , what 's this ? - Sorry to hit and run , officers , but I thought you guys oughta know your buddies on the rock are in big trouble . The inmates have taken over the asylum , and they 're waiting to spring Gagnon . Gotta go . - They 're waiting to spring Gagnon ! Who 's waiting ! - Well , there are several of Gagnon 's organization currently incarcerated in the rock , sir . Shall I put together a swat team , captain ? - Fredo , the rock is the highest security prison in the system . If a swat team blasts their way in there , Jane and haldane will be as good as dead . - Yeah , you 're right . Well ... if it 's Gagnon they want ... it 's Gagnon they get . - Nothin ' yet ? - Nah . Oh . How 's your boyfriend , Officer ? Ooh , not good , huh ? How come you 're so perky ? You know , you 're pretty , Officer . Oh , my , you 're hot , or is that just me ?

This organization needs some New blood at the top . - Hey , I don 't like what I 'm hearin ' , volker . - Well , you don 't have to listen . - oh ! Oh ... oh . - Well , that takes care of that problem . - Put your hands up . Welcome to the rock , officers . Put ' em in one of the cells . Move it- - move it ! It 's a privilege to meet ya , Mr. Gagnon . - Yeah . Mr. Gagnon . - Mr. Gagnon . Nice to see you , sir . - Yeah . - You know , I 've worked for you for 15 years , and we 've never met . You know , it 's a pity it 's gonna be such a short acquaintance . - Ah ! - Captain , look out ! - Ah ! - Now , are you a little hot , or is that just me ? Huh ? - All right , haldane ! Haldane ! That 's enough ! On your knees , volker ! Hands behind your back ! - Oh , thank god you 're all right . - Yeah . It 's easy for you to say . Thanks to you , I got one hell of a cold . - Romek , we 're finished up here ! Send in the crew !

So we 've recorded it , and now we can all watch it together . - I 'm on my way . - Yeah , but just , uh , make sure nobody tells you the score before you get here . - My ears are plugged . - I am happy to see you alive , Officer haldane . - What do you mean , you 're happy , slomo ? You don 't have feelings . - I know- - It was a platitude . - Well , I would love to sit here and discuss platitudes with you , but I 've got a baseball game to go watch . - Baseball ? Oh , yes , that stupid earth game where humans stand around doing nothing for three hours . I believe the final result was- - - Slomo , slomo , no ! Turn it down ! Go away- - Go away ! I don 't wanna know . Go away . - Oh , sorry . - Better take care of yourself , haldane . That 's a nasty bug you 've got there . - Yeah , tell me about it . Look , I don 't know if you 've noticed , but I was a little out of it back there . - I noticed . - Yeah , um ... You know when you did that ... were you just tryin to give me your flu or- - - That 's for me to know and for you to wonder about . - Okay . - Hey , haldane , did you hear the baseball score ? - No- - No- - No- - quiet ! I don 't wanna know ! - Where you been , man ? - What 'd I miss- - What 'd I miss ? - You didn 't miss anything . All right , you ready ? - Yeah , let 's go ! - Welcome to the seventh game of the world series , pitting the New York YANKEES- - [ all cheering ] - Against the yami-Yuri giants . [ all booing ] - Hey , guys ! You hear the giants won , six to five ? Sado hit a home run in the bottom of the 12th .

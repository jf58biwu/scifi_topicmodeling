 The name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now- - Well , let 's just say , " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - hold it . Enjoy . - Hey , you two , this way , please . - Ladies and gentlemen , entities and high minds , it 's outlawed in every known star system , but here , tonight , in demeter city on plant altor , we know what turns you on . On my left , tildon of sagania , Winner of five bouts . His opponent , ogree of elron , the undefeated champion . All bets are final . May the best man live . [ cheering ] - Kill him ! [ Booing ] - Kill him ! [ Cheering ] - All right , mister Brill . Do you know you almost mowed down a whole row of pedestrians back there on that overway ? - What overway ? Hey , I am not drunk . - All right , then why don 't you do what I 'm thinking . - No problem . I can walk a straight line . - that 's cute . Now , why don 't you try with your feet on the ground , wise guy . - Ooh ! - Hey ! Aah , I 'll be right back . - there- - I picked up some movement . Hold it steady . - This is stupid . Accidentally running into a police officer isn 't a capital offense , you know . Usually an apology will get you off the hook . - He 's got company- - It 's a cop . - Do ' em both . - So what 's the hurry ? - Hey ! - All units , all units , Officer needs assistance . - Let 's go , go , go ! - Don 't mind us gatecrashers . - Did a guy come back your way ? - No . - Damn . - Now , wait till you see this . Fully integrated laser side arms . Global and intergalactic satellite uplinks . Nowadays , the bad guys don 't stand a chance . - So , um , what are you telling me , romek , that there 's no more crime ? - Ah , jeez , gramps . - Who 's the old-Timer ? - Romek 's granddad . He was one of demeter city 's first cops . Isn 't that right , slomo ? - He was the , uh , desk sergeant at the third precinct downtown . - Romek thought he 'd show him around to impress him . - Bad idea . The third was legendary . - Comlink from the 38th on the , uh , donut man , castle . - Thanks , slomo . - Is this police harassment or something ? Hey . - Slomo , did you get out the apb on our tattooed mystery man ? - Yes , ba , lieutenant . Uplinked nearly 27 minutes ago to all outer precincts , hospitals , doctors , the whole enchilada . - Anything on the vehicle or shooters ? - Ah , negative . - This is where the donut man makes his final move . A whole rack of donuts in a single swipe . Incredible tail work . Ha-Ha-Ha . - What 's so funny ? - Ha-Ha-Ha . - Ah , no , I get this . You guys want me to think that you 're laughing at me . - It 's not you . - What 's so funny ? - Ha-Ha-Ha . - Lieutenant , your wife 's on com four . She has something for you . So , what 's so funny ? - Ha-Ha-Ha . - one of the nice things about working nights , I get to see my husband once in a while . You , too , haldane . - Thank you . - Uh , what 's up , hon ? - Well , listen , a-a guy came out of emergency a little while ago . He 's got a blast wound to his shoulder , and he fits your apb . He 's covered in tattoos . - is he okay ? Yeah , the blast wound isn 't that bad , but he 's got a lot of other bruises and abrasions . - So he 's not a librarian . - Here , Sal . - Ah , oh , thank you . Ah , but it looks like you 're gonna have to fight immigration for him . They 've turned up a match on our dna identity check . He 's an illegal , and he 's tried to come to altor before . - Well , uh , put off immigration as long as you can , will ya , hon ? - Sure , but why ? - I think I owe the guy one . He may have saved my neck . - Name 's tildon , saganian , unskilled laborer . Applied for immigration , he didn 't make the quota , tried to slip onto altor twice , both he and his son . - all we 're saying is that immigration shouldn 't get first call on this guy . - He 's an illegal alien , Brogan . - It 's a crime wanting to come to altor ? Like haldane and me ? - Ha-Ha-Ha- - And half the department , but it 's True . But all of you had skills the PLANET needed or at least knew what strings to pull . - Or didn 't get caught . - Icc learn of an illegal , they return him to point of origin . You know the rules . - So they make an exception . - Give me a reason ? - Ah , he 's an eyewitness to the attempted murder of a police officer . - Good answer . - Thank you . - All right , I 'll see what I can do . And in the meantime- - - Haldane and I are going to the hospital . - why don 't you two go to the hospital ? - But , wait , but- - can 't you see this man is unfit to travel . - He looks okay to me . - Look , right . - Now what ? - I 'm just taking your badge number . - Ah , suit yourself , lady , but I got a job to do . - He 's wanted for questioning by the dcpd . Oh , forget it . - I hope you had a swell time , pal , 'cause you 're leaving on a slow flight to sagania , ten months . - Ha-Ha-Ha . - No . - Hardware , easy , it 's up to you . - and this guy from IMMIGRATION ignored podly 's request ? Yes , this guy is strictly by the books . If it 's not signed by a judge or magistrate , it 's not a legal document . - hang on , Sal , I haven 't left yet . - You asked for it . - Drop the gun . - don 't do it , tildon . - Brogan . - You all right ? - Yes . I 'm sorry . - Yeah . - Look , grandpa , I 'm sorry . I thought you 'd enjoy it up there in the station . I mean , I thought it would bring back some good memories . - can 't help you there . Don 't remember much anymore . The way things go . - hmm ! - Not now . - Tildon , reduce your speed and descend to street level . - He reduces his speed anymore and we 're all gonna be walkin ' . - All units , all units , in pursuit of stolen icc Van ... - Slug . - ... southwest of demeter general . Suspect should be considered armed and dangerous . - We 're on your tail , boys- - Where do you want us ? - Ah , stay put for now . Let 's see where he 's leadin us . - You got it . Hey , haldane , what 's that yo-Yo doing up there ? - I haven 't a clue , romek . - It 's about time you admitted it , haldane . - Well , how do , ladies- - Come to join the convoy ? - Something like that . - Here we go . - No , he 's not running . He 's taking us somewhere . All units , do not close on suspect . Repeat , allow suspect to continue . Copy . - It 's pa . - Copy , lieutenant . - Check , lieutenant , you 're the man . - Does this area look familiar to you ? - Yeah , like I was here only hours ago . - Romek , you and orion take the rooftops . Jane , take up a position at the other end of the alley . - If this guy 's leadin ' us somewhere , why is he playing hide and seek ? - Damned if I know . You stay here- - I 'm going in . - Oh , that 's great . I 'll make sure to tell Sally Those were your last words . - You 're a funny guy , haldane . - You got to help me . - Okay . - They 've got my son . - Brogan ! - This could get real messy if we 're not careful . - first , you will help me get my son back , then you can deport us both . - Lose the weapon , and I 'll listen . Oh . - on sagania , my race has been persecuted for more than a millennium . My only hope , and my son , nillim 's Only hope for any kind of future , was to immigrate . When all legal ways failed , we turned to Coe Barner . - Mmm , bad choice . - at the time , he was the only choice . He promised to smuggle us onto altor . He took everything we had . - And Barner forced you to fight . You 're lucky to be alive . - I was his champion . - Barner backs you ? - It was easy money for him . The fights were rigged . - How do you rig a snuff fight ? It 's not like the other guy 's gonna take a fall . - Before every bout , Barner fixed a flame stone to my forehead . - Flame stone ? - They act as a powerful stimulant to my species . They give us amazing strength . We once worshipped them as a cure all , as an answer to our problems , but it was the flame stones that ultimately reduced us to slaves . During the fight , the stone acts with my adrenaline , absorbs into my bloodstream . It 's a terrible thing to lose control , but it 's how I finally broke free . [ cheering ] [ cheering ] - Stop him . What 's he doing ? - Barner , run after him . - It was only after the STIMULANT finally wore off , I realized I made a mistake . Barner still had nillim , my son . You 've got to help me get him back . - So Barner 's operation is somewhere around here , right ? - Yes . - Well , let 's get the show on the road . - All right , that 's your loss . - You did fine . We 'll let you know where and when you do the next show . - Hey , Barner , you promised me more than this . - I 'm sorry , it was a slow night . You wanna complain ? You take it up with my complaints department . - Hey . - Where 's my father , Mr. Barner ? - Oh , there 's no easy way to say this , kid , But , uh , he 's gone . He 's run away and left you . - He would never leave me . - Sometimes the strain of being a parent gets to us all . I 'm sorry , kid . But don 't worry , we 're your family now . We 'll take care of ya . Go on . - Come on we better be movin ' . - Right . - seems to be some activity inside , lieutenant . - Copy , romek . - Ooh- - Ooh . What was that ? - You stay here , grandpa . - Jane , you and took- - - in position , lieutenant . - Okay , let 's do it . One , two ... - and three . - Maybe it was somethin ' we said . - Okay , this whole area is hot . We 'll leave it for forensics . - Oh , no ! Sorry , lieutenant- - I told him to stay put . Gramps ! - Somethin ' I wanted to tell you , romek . - Not now , grandpa . - It 's gone clean outta of my head . I thought I had it but now it 's gone . - Come on . Hey , what are you doing up here anyway ? - I thought I had it , and now it 's gone clean out of my head . - Hey , you guys , over here . - What do you got ? - Give me a hand here . - It 's the sewers . They 're on the move . - What am I supposed to do , Warren ? - Beats me . - I mean , I told him I got work to do . He just nods . - I thought he didn 't like it here ? - How do I know what he 's thinkin ' . How does anybody know what he 's thinkin ' . he doesn 't even know himself . - face it , romek , he 's a couple of stars short of a galaxy . - You 're talkin ' about my grandfather here . - But you just said- - Oh , never mind . - Oh , man , now where did he go ? - Here , ah , - - so where 's the saganian now ? - Ah , castle and took are getting him some clothes and supplies . - right , I 'm handing him over to immigration . - What ? - Look , icc are breathing down my neck . As soon as they hear we 've got him , they 'll suck him up like a black hole . - Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha ! - What about Barner ? - Listen , you two , Barner 's a priority for me , too . Unfortunately , your tattooed friend had the SINGULAR bad judgment to dribble two immigration officials like they were slam balls . - So the bad guys just win ? - Yeah . - I say we never had this conversation . - I say we forget the whole ante . I really hate workin nights- - It 's- - - If we don 't report that we found him , there 'll be nothing in the database for icc to latch onto . - Paperwork 's already been started . - Give us one day . Look , this is the best chance we 've ever had for nailing ' Barner and stopping ' the snuff fights . - You know what 's written above the entrance of the old police academy building ? - Overconfidence leads to disaster . - right , old-Timer . - But , uh , on the inside it reads , " a good cop 's instincts are usually good . " - Mm . Mm . - All right , Brogan , you 've got your 26 hours . Only keep that saganian under wraps . - Yeah , I know just the place . - Oh , hold on , fellas . I , uh , think this may come in handy . - " Coe Barner 's private supper club , live entertainment . " - Ah , it sounds like a hell of a night . - hmm , the only thing that 's missing is the address . - Where did you get this ? - Oh , uh , it was in my pocket . Ooh . - hmm . - Mom ! - How many times do I got to tell you , stay out of my room . - Hey , Hey , Hey , hey ! - Orbital . - Matt , is that anyway to greet a guest in our home ? - Hi , I 'm Matt . - Matt . - Hi . - Where 's your mom ? - I think she 's in her room . - Oh , I was , um , just resting after the night shift .

I got to get this . - Well , um , maybe I should make some coffee . Will you join me ? - Thank you . - Took interviewed a Hooker that vice picked up a couple of hours ago . Thought you might want to see this . - I hear you wanna make a deal ? - I figured this is the fourth time you guys have busted me , and if I don 't give you something you wanna hear , I 'm gonna go down . - I 'm listening . - So we got a deal ? - Well , that depends what you give me . - There 's a fight comin up , comin ' soon . - Oh , well , that 's just a whole pack of information . Thanks a lot- - You can go now . - a snuff fight . - go on . - Coe Barner 's behind it . - and he just happened to call you up and tell you all about it . - that 's right .

I don 't mind spending it with you , it 's just that I rather be spending it in bed . - Well , not in bed with- - You know what I mean . - You think we 'll ever get past this , Jack ? - The work ? - You and me ? - What about you and me ? - That 's what I 'm trying to talk to you about . - excuse me , officer took 's trying to raise you on com . - Great- - Thanks , slomo . - Peaceful . So long since I 've felt at peace . You 've a wonderful home , lieutenant , a lovely family . - um , maybe you want to eat somethin ' . it could be a long day . - I thought anything would be better than sagania , but I was wrong . - It 's not so bad here . You 've just seen the worst of it . - Those men I had to fight , they would have killed me if they could have . But it 's still not right to do what I 've done . - Well , from what you 've told me , you didn 't have a whole lot of choice . - to take a life is no easy thing . - This is the location took 's informant gave us . Give me a vector grid , please . Emphasize line 8 between 20.3 and 30.6 . Enhance , please . - Look familiar ? - Durl and seagal , Barner 's men . - hold it .

In fact , the pharaoh 's are backing him for nearly a quarter of a million . - That is a lot of credits . - Your father was set to fight him , but he 's left us . - I 'm sorry . - If I don 't find an answer to the pharaoh 's challenge , I not only lose the credits , but most likely my business . Your father has really let me down . - I will fight him . - but you 're just a boy ! - I 've worked out with my father . He said I was pretty good . With a flame stone . - You 're more of a man than I thought . You 'll make a great champion , nillim . - Leave him alone , Barner . - father ! - You 'll be all right , son .

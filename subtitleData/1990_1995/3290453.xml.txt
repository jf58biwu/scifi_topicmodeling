Do you have any plans tomorrow night around ... 5 : 00 ? Oh , darn it . I have to go to New Mexico for a funeral . - My grandmother died . - Yes ! I mean ... I 'm so sorry for you . But you 'll love New Mexico and so will your grandmother . I 'll be back on tuesday .

She 's going away but I finally know who it will be . - Who ? - Melissa Sinclair . - Melissa Sinclair ? - She missed the yearbook photo session . - She missed it ? - She missed the photo session ! ( Both Howling ) I 'm so excited ! I told you the watches were a good idea . They 're a great idea . I am so pumped . - I got to do something crazy . - Good luck . No luck required . ( Bell Ringing ) Melissa Sinclair ? - Yeah . - Gary ... Gary Wallace . Remember it , ' cause tomorrow afternoon you 'll be screaming it repeatedly in the throes of passion . - Oh , really ? - Guaranteed . You a virgin ? - What ? - It 's okay if you are . - I am . - I really don 't need to know this . I 'm not a virgin by choice . It 's just that every girl I 've met thought I was a freaky dweeb . So let 's knock it out at my place . Don 't wear anything too complicated . And the body oil 's on me . Get it ? ( Groans ) It 's settled then . No oils . Damn . WYATT : Whoo whoo-hoo ! - Yeah , Wyatt ! - Whoo-hoo ! Did you see that , Lisa ? I didn 't hurl ! That 's my Wyatt . How about a little alligator wrestling ? Whoo-hoo ! Hey . What are you doing here ? It 's almost 5 : 00 . Shouldn 't you be having sex now ? - I wish . - What about the sure thing ? Let 's just say it didn 't work out . Huh ? You 're destined to be with somebody else . There is nobody else . I cruised the malls all morning . - Nothing . - But the watch ... Screw the watch . It says I got ten minutes . And my best hope is in New Mexico burying her grandmother . It must be broken . Whoops . I almost put on your watch . No way . I 'm wearing mine . No . I got yours right here , see ? Lisa inscribed it . " To Gary , with love , Lisa . " " To Wyatt , with love , Lisa . " How did you get my watch . - Uh-oh . - What ? You must have accidentally put on each other 's watches . So I won 't have sex in ten minutes ? - Uh-oh . - " Uh-oh " ? What does that mean , " Uh-oh " ? I 'm going to be a virgin for 90 years ? Then if this is my watch does that mean ... Say something ! You 're going to be dead in ten minutes . ( Screeching ) : Uh-oh . 90 years ... I 'm not going to get any for 90 long years . Why me , God ? Why me ? Do you mind ? I 'm the one dying here . At least you don 't have to wait until 105 to do the deed . I 'll never do the deed . According to my watch , I 'll be dead in ... seven minutes ! - I got to stop this watch ! - Wyatt , that was a gift . Besides , breaking the watch won 't help . I don 't mean to complain but I 'm six minutes from dying , - and you haven 't done Jack ! - I think I 've figured a way out . - Come on . What is it ? - You 're not powerless . You still control your own destiny . The way I see it , all you 'd have to do is ... ( Static Sound ) - What ? Do what ? - Lisa ! GARY : What happended to the lights ? Oh , no ! The computer ! It crashed ! - There 's no power ! - What about batteries ? - I don 't have any . - Go to manuel override . It 's a computer , not a submarine ! Four minutes . Follow me . Gary , why are we hiding in the shower ? It 's the safest place in the house . Who ever got killed in the shower ? I 'm scared . Think happy thoughts or something . Happy thoughts ? Yeah . Like the first time we met . - Remember ? - No . Your eighth birthday party . Your mom set up the slip-n-slide . We had ice cream cake then camped outside and played flashlight tag . Gary , we didn 't meet till I was ten . Oh . You missed a great party . I wonder who that guy was . - You don 't have to stay , Gary . - No . I want to . - You 've been a good friend . - Shut up . You 're not going anywhere . Maybe Lisa couldn 't help you but I can . Yeah ? You think so ? ( Cat Shrieking ) Who am I kidding ? You 're a dead man . It 's not supposed to happen for another . - Three minutes . - It 's going to take three wholes minutes for you to die ? ( Footsteps ) Well , now ... rub-a-dub-dub . Here 's a picture guaranteed to make Dad glow with pride . Say adios to your shower buddy . I blew the fure box juicing up my diehard . I 'm going to need help getting my jeep running before dinner . I 'm rigging this baby with nitro . Zero to 60 in three seconds . Two minutes ... Just keep your brain planted in that seat . Turn the ignition when I tell you . Uh , uh , uh , uh , uh . Damn . Push in the cigarette lighter and don 't get your greasy fingers on the dash . Oh , my God . This how it happens . I 'm going to blow up ! Hey ! Where do you think you 're going ? - Chett , I 'm about to die . - That 's right , cudboy . - Get in that jeep , or I 'll kill you . - It 's the jeep ! It 's going to blow ! That jeep 's not going anywhere and neither are you . You don 't understand . Okay , look . I 'll level with you . I 've got this watch- - This magic watch- - that tells me when I 'm going to die . It says I only have one minute to live . How stupid do I look to you ? Don 't answer that , Wallace . He 's telling the truth . I got a magic watch too . Only mine says I won 't get sex for 90 years . Now that I believe . Get back in the jeep , now . - You 're running out of time . - ( Hissing ) All right , Chett . Let 's go . You and me , over there . - Why there ? - Because the ground 's a lot harder there and it will hurt more when I knock you - on your big , ugly butt . - Oh , the schoolgirl roars . Come on . Let 's get this over with . Kick your butt here , kick your butt there . Either way , it 's a boot-butt banquet . Say good-bye to daylight . My jeep . My beautiful jeep . Wyatt- - you 're still alive . - What does the watch say ? - It 's changed . It says 86 years . I 'm going to live ! - You 're going to live ! - I 'm going to live ! - You 're going to live ! - I 'm going to live ! Okay , we have power . She 'll be back on-line in J. ( Whimpering ) Now , that is a man in pain . Here she comes . What happened ? Wyatt , how much time do you have left ? It 's okay , Lisa . My check-out time came and went . - I made it . - How ? I stood up to Chett , and I saved my own life . Oh , I 'm so glad you 're still alive . What about me ? I 'm still a virgin . Take a cue from Wyatt . The watch showed him his fate and he refused to accept it . He took action and changed his destiny . - That 's all you have to do . - Really ? Well , that and ... don 't miss this flight to New Mexico . Weasy ... Weasy ... Weasy . Captioned by Grantman Brown

Tomorrow , the halls of the Orujo family , the owners of the world famous bakery Orujo , will be prepared to host the wedding of Patricia Orujo , the only daughter and heiress of the Orujo empire , with Luis María de Ostolaza . Yarritu ! Get the fuck out of here ! Let 's go ! Was it tough being locked up so long , boss ? Nah . I watched a lot of TV , especially the news . Freeze ! Police ! Drop the spray ! Drop the spray ! I wanted to clean up a little , but you know ... with all the hurry ... What 's up with the computer ? The hard drive is fucked up , I don 't know what 's wrong with it . You couldn 't collect the laundry ? - And my tuxedo ? - In your room , Ramón . Impeccable . - And the guns ? - We just need to clean them . This is the cake ? Yes , OK , without the cream and the cherries ... We have to frost it . We 've got five minutes to go . I want this cake to be perfect ! Let 's see if you know exactly what the plan is . Manitas , feed the cat ! Do you think he 's angry ? It 's possible that he knows nothing . Don 't you think he 'll find out ? The news was on every channel . They 've put him in a bad mood . We fucked up , so they want to everyone to know . M.A. said things went wrong because we didn 't think it through , that we have to do it again . Cuz without a plan , things don 't go right . Ah ! We need a guy with guts and balls , too . Otherwise it 's chaos . Goddammit , man , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Let me do it ! Shit ! For fucks sake where did you plug in this thing ? Let 's try it this way , Let 's try ... These tubes are the brake hydraulics , god damn it ! You fucked up everything ! Danger ! Danger ! What did I tell you , huh ? Ask before touching anything . Now move your ass and fix this ! The ship could explode ! I don 't give a shit ... Alright ! Let 's try to concentrate on the plan . O.K. We enter here with the truck . There are two guards here . We pass them like we brought the cake ... There won 't be any problems , huh ? We 've got 15 minutes to get out of there before the real truck with the cake arrives . This is the back entrance . And if we try to get out here ? That would be fast too . Shut up ! Looks like you 're thinking a lot lately . No , I just thought if there are two guards here ... I bet you organized the last kidnapping ! Or no one did ? You just went there to make a mess , and give away oranges . - No , it wasn 't like that , Ramón . Then how ? We did our best . He just died . - We had bad luck . - Right . - And what was with the plastic surgeon ? - That was different . He 's the one who got nervous and jumped out of the car . What about the fashion show ? 50kg of explosives that blew up one hour after everyone walked out . If you wanted to make an impression ... you made it . 5 years I 've spent , watching you clowns on TV , making fools of yourselves on the news . It wasn 't like that ? It wasn 't like that ? Who do you think you are ? Did you forget the three big questions ? What were you when I found you ? We were garbage , hospital waste ! Who pulled you out of the gutter and made you what you are today ? - You , Ramón ! - And what are you now ? Mutants ! Mutants ! Mutants ! We are the soldiers of the mutant army , and we 'll win the war ! Society treated us like shit and now we 're gonna kick it 's ass ! The world is dominated by cute little babies , and daddies . God ! Enough with the ' light ' shit ! Enough with the aftershave , enough with car commercials , enough of mineral water ! We don 't want to smell good ! We don 't want to get thin ! No ! We just want to be ourselves : The whole world is made of stupid followers . Yeah ! We are mutants , not the sunbathing elite ! Yeah ! And now we 're gonna show them the meaning of the word terror . - Look , there 's Cuqui with that girl . - Did you see her face ? I bet she drinks and does drugs . What a pair , " for better or worse " ... - I 've been told she does drugs too . - Really ? Yes , Gusi and Tato told me , they 're getting high too . Fucking shit on a shingle . The bride 's dress looks like a rental . Looks like her mother made it . The groom 's tuxedo looks like a print , but when you get closer , you see it 's just covered with grease spots . How are you tonight ! ? Lovely party ! You look like a movie star , darling ! Where did you get this great dress ? Trash . You 've made me the happiest man on earth . I wish your mother could be here . Don 't cry , papa ! I 'm so happy ... We brought the cake . - All of you brought this cake ? - It 's ... It 's big . Through here . One moment ... Just two . Well , we 'll just wait here until they come back , OK ? There 's a lot of us , and with all the fuss in there ... Looks like we 're late . You think we 'll have problems with the cake ? We should go in and make sure . Alright , guys . I know you 're not programmed to let us through , but it must suck to stand here all day for nothing . Maybe you would consider ignoring your programming and let us in . What do you say ? M.A. , ask these gentlemen to let us in . Like we agreed , try to get in unnoticed , and mingle with the crowd . Proceed . Here we go ! Through here . ... when I saw her smile . My eyes saw all the love . I like it . I ran to his side ... and I invited her . That happy night , I fell in love . My heart ... How many bakers , and they 're all wearing tuxedos . I 've got a feeling this night will be unforgettable . Keep stirring ! Is this great or what ? He wants to know if there 's more chicken . Now listen , so everything 's clear . O.K. When the bride cuts the cake , play ' Aires de Fiesta ' by Karina on the jukebox . Air of celebration , the boys and the girls ... radiantly hap - Chepa , this will be the sign for you to jump out , - and chloroform the girl . - Got it . Your job is to kill the lights , so I can grab the girl and we get out . Got it . I turn off the lights . Alright . No , you set the music on the jukebox . - and then I turn off the lights . - No , M.A. Turns the lights off . - You stand guard . - You didn 't say nothing about that . Well I 'm telling you now : You stand guard . What about me , Ramón ? I stand guard , too ? No , you 're going to set the music on the jukebox with your brother . - Everything clear ? - So ... , when the lights go out , I go after the girl . No , no ! When the song starts playing ! - The song is the signal ! - Right , when the music starts . You won 't be able to see if the lights go out . Right ? Alright , enough ! Let 's just do it ! - Alright , give me a coin . - I don 't have any money . - What do you mean , you don 't have any money ? - I don 't have any money . How was I supposed to know we were going shopping ? Stop screwing around . Give me a coin , come on . Give me a coin I swear I don 't have one ! I 'm a rebel because the world made me this way , because no one treated me with love ... No , it isn 't that one ... How does it go ? Fuck ! I 'll see you later ! Air of celebration , the boys and the girls ... radiantly happy , Air of celebration , marching in time for papa . I pronounce you ... I pronounce you ... I pronounce you ... I pronounce you ... - all in a chorus , singing with force , for papa . We are going determined to spend this day , with great joy , and good humor . The people smile when they see that we ... I pronounce you ... I pronounce you ... I pronounce you ... I pronounce you ... I pronounce you ... Air of celebration , the boys and the girls ... radiantly happy . Air of celebration , marching in time for papa . Let 's go . Shut up , damn it ! Don 't move ! Let 's go , we have to get out of here ! Get back ! M.A. , without second thought . Freeze ! Police ! Drop your weapons and you won 't get hurt ! Don 't get fooled by the tape , moron . You may think I 'm in prison , but I 'm not . Not anymore . Yes , you heard right . At this moment ... if everything went according to plan , I 'm on my way to the planet Axturias ... with your daughter . Son of a bitch ! Father , relax , it 's only a video . If we don 't watch it carefully , we won 't hear the ransom conditions . You should try to stay calm or you won 't hear the ransom conditions . I will explain them to you now , so you will understand perfectly . I want 100 million in unmarked bills , in an antifusion suitcase . Simple , no ? The meeting point will be at the Lost Mine Bar in the Devil 's Valley , on the planet Axturias . Alright , I know you are one stupid fuck , but I don 't think you 're stupid enough to call the police . Because if you do , your daughter will lose more than her virginity . We will meet two days after you receive this video . Hala , to cracking it ! I swear you 're going to pay for this . no matter where you go ! Fucking terrorist ! Our number , eh ... , of identification is ... 477337 / 7 . Fishing ship Virgen del Carmen . - Number of crew ? - One , at your service . This heavy computer presents almost all the weight ... Cargo ? Frozen fish , codfish sweets , eh ... , lobster tails and stuff like that . And where are you headed ? We 're bound for Ganymede , that stuff sells good there . especially the crab . Alright , now look carefully . Do you know this man ? Damn , he looks familiar . Was he on television ? I watch a lot of television . There 's only this computer here , so ... Of course he was on the news . He 's a terrorist seen in the area . Now that you 've mentioned it , so it happens , a while ago , a strange cruiser passed by , Could you tell me what direction it went ? Well , I think ... about 15 degrees N-NE coaxial alpha-9 , but I 'm really not sure , so don 't hold me to that ... Very good . You may proceed , but don 't go off course . Great ! Three times we 've passed these checkpoints with the facade of the fishing boat . I 'm not doing it the next time ! I have a police record too ! They 're going to recognize me with the cap and everything , damn it . How did it go ? Eh ? Very good , Ramón . They 've bought it again . Remain on course until we reach G-7 . Got it . Connect the secondary turbine conductors and make a 45 degree turn ... What did he say ? - Do you know what he said ? - I don 't know . You heard it . Whatever . Dinner is ready . but - when do I turn ? Again this shit . Since the kidnapping we haven 't eaten nothing but these tails . Give me two . You can eat the cat food if you want . - Speak . - I go with 50.000 . I see you ... and I raise you 50.000 . Tomorrow , when we get the 10 million from the ransom you can eat whatever you want . I see you 50k and raise you 50k . You 're not bluffing again , are you ? I hope you know we 're playing for our parts of the ransom , not for these tails here . Look , we 'll play as we want to . I see you 50k and raise you 100k - Pass me the can . - Are you sure ? I 'm not too sure about this . Look , I don 't want to be boring , but you 've lost ... 2,400,000 ecus so far . That means if you lose this game , you only have 10,000 left . What do you mean 10,000 ? What about his part ? What part ? You two are one part ! Half and half , one part ! Ten million by four ... Two and a half million . Alright ... We 'll make four parts . Is the dinner ready ? If we get one part , he get 's half . Where is the remote ? Where did you hide the remote ! ? Now fuck yourselves ! Take the remote from him ! Come on , give me the remote . We always watch what you want . Give me the remote ! Give me the god damned remote ! - I 've had it ! - Now . One of these days , I 'm going to explode , you hear me ? ! What happens if I explode , eh ? If I explode , what then ? The daughter of the industrialist J. M. Orujo is still missing ... Hey , look , you 're on television , hehe ! Known worldwide for their pastries ... specialized in manufacturing the famous Orujo rolls . The famous Orujo rolls . The police sources think that the known terrorist gang The Mutant Movement is behind this crime . This one turned out alright , didn 't it ? Patricia Orujo was kidnapped on the very day of her wedding by this terrorist group , again leaving a terrible massacre behind . Between the bodies there were identified : José Montero , AKA Chepa , and Amancio González , AKA M.A. , responsible , among other , for assassination of bodybuilder Muscles of Elche and the recent assassination of Matías Pons . This just in , thanks to the family of the victim , we now know the exact amount demanded for the release of Patricia Orujo . 100 million ecus . The trade will take place tomorrow on the planet of Axturias , in the Gutenberg galaxy . This is what happened ... How much did he say ? Did he say 100 million , or did I misunderstand ? No , no , no . Not 100 . Ramón said 10 . There must have been a mistake . Are you sure he said 100 ? Ramón did the negotiating . He said he demanded 10 million . If he demanded 100 and we get 10 , then ... What is it now ? Again the brake fluids ? No , the brake fluids are o.k. It 's something else ... we were watching television the news were on ... - They talked about the kidnapping . - And ? Well nothing , just ... looks like ... You didn 't tell us that the family is going to pay 100 million . 100 million what ? 100 million ecus , the guy on the news said it loud and clear . 100 mill . You told us 10 . So I said 10 and the guy on the television said 100 , huh ? We don 't want you to think , that we are saying , that you might be lying or anything like that . It 's alright . I get it now . All this years for nothing . All this years I 've fought for you I gave you everything . And now you think , that I 'm a dirty thief , and a fucking traitor , is that it ! ? No , it 's not like that ! - No , Ramón , it 's not that . - We always trusted you . All we want is an explanation . How can you be so naive ? You watch the news and you believe it . You don 't realize , you dumb fucks , that that is precisely what they want ! ? We start doubting ourselves ! And we end up killing each other and solve their problem . What did I tell you , huh ? 100 million ! Ha ha ha ! They could have said one thousand easily . - Or whatever . - Or two ? Good ! The important thing is , that tomorrow we get the 10 million . Real ones . We have to be prepared for the transfer . Stop screwing around , everything has to go perfect , as we planned it ! Did you check the refractant turboprocessors ? The turboprocessors of the atom module chamber ? - No , the other ones . - No , that ones , no . Well , get to it . Quimicefa , confirm the sections of the automatic circuits . I already confirmed them this morning . - Did you grease them up ? - No , that no ... That 's bad . They must be greased up . Tomorrow will be the most important day of our lives , and we have to prepare ourselves . Let 's see , what were you when I found you ? We were garbage ! Hospital waste ! Who pulled you out of the gutter and made you what you are today ? - You , Ramón ! - What are you ? Mutants ! Mutants ! Mutants ! Mutants ! Mutants ! Mutants ! Mutants ! You know ... I always do what I 'm told , and I newer complain , but I don 't understand why do we have to do the same things that we did this morning . Shut your pie hole ! If Ramon says we have to check the turbocompresors , we 'll check them , and that 's final . Don 't you start any troubles now . And besides , we checked the ones of the atom module chamber and Ramon says to check the others . O.K. , and where are those others ? - You don 't know where they are ? - No , you ? Manitas , I think we have to figure out a way so that these kinds of misunderstandings don 't happen again . Yes , damn it . I think it would be great to have more information , on how the bookkeeping of this enterprise is run , huh ? I totally agree . Even more . Now that we 've lost Chepa , you could be in charge of the administration and the bookkeeping of ransoms . Really ? Thank you ! I can 't believe it ! Me the accountant ? ! Do you really mean it ? No , not really . What do these turbocompresors even look like ? What do they look like ? What do they look like ? You just look and when we find them I 'll tell you what they look like ! Did you hear a scream ? Yes , that would be the turbocompresors calling us . It 's eating me ! This time it was a scream . Let 's go ! Get me out of here ! Get me out of here ! It 's eating me ! Get me out ! Get me out ! Ah ! Manitas ! Be still ! Don 't just stand here looking , do something ! You do it , sucker ! Manitas ! Don 't move I 'll give you a hand ! My God ! Manitas ! Get out of the way ! Move ! Manitas ! Manitas ! God ! Alright , guys . This confirms my suspicions . I haven 't said anything yet because I wasn 't sure . - But you see the obvious . - What ? Manitas was clever and knew what was going on . And for that he was murdered . Guys , we have a traitor among ourselves . How are we going to make him out ? We have to stick together . That way the traitor will give himself up alone . - Why ? I don 't understand . - Shut up ! Go on , Ramón . In a few hours we 'll be getting to our rendezvous point ... We 'll let him make the first move . But if the traitor is among us he 'll hear everything , and ... - Do you have a better idea ? - No , I it 's fine , I 'm just , not sure about ... Listen , why are you asking so many questions ? And if I inspect your lab ? Brrrpp ! Don 't jump to conclusions , violence won 't solve anything . - That 's true . - Everyone back to their rooms . It wasn 't me . You have to believe me . You neither , because you 're not capable of anything without me . That leaves Ramón and Quimicefa . Who are we going to trust ? Poor Manitas ! We have to get something straight . - Everything is straight . - I don 't think so . If you remember , when Ramón entered ... When he entered , nothing ! If you have something to say why didn 't you say it earlier ? - Let him speak , huh ? - You shut up ! You think you 're so smart , don 't you ! Looks like you 've got it all figured out . More than you might think . - You 're probably feeling guilty . - I think you 're probably feeling guilty . Why don 't you just explode and leave us be ? Damn ! - Aren 't we going to sleep ? - Shut up ! Do you want to wake up with a bullet in your head ? - I don 't trust nobody one bit . Alright , then you stand guard ? Wake me if something happens , OK ? What 's wrong with you ? Is something the matter ? Because , if something 's wrong you can tell me . You know you 're here like a guest ... - Are you hungry ? Cold ... Are you cold ? You 're sitting here half naked . If you catch something , what is your father going to say ? We didn 't have a chance to talk peacefully . I 'm sorry about your wedding , I really am , but you know how things are . When you 're shooting all around , and you don 't know how you 're going to get out ... I 'm very sorry , really . I know it 's no comfort , but your fiancee was no good , you know . He was after your money , Patricia . It was obvious . In time you 'll see we did you a favor . I 'm sure ... Now because of this , you 'll find someone better . Someone who will really love you , for you , for ... for who you are ... not for your father 's millions ... someone who 'll know how to take care of you ... I know , I know , I know ... You 're feeling uncomfortable , surrounded by strangers , miles away from home , from your friends ... But we could become friends , right ? I 'm going to have some money now , and ... who knows ... Is it time ? What time is it ? Were you listening ? You 're a pig , you hear me ? You 're always hanging around , always watching me ! Get the fuck out of here ! Go ! Go ! And you ! Watch yourself if you want to get out of here alive ! Let 's go ! Mmm ! Quimicefa , there 's something I have to tell you . Don 't get up , it won 't take long . I didn 't want the others to know . This is between you and me . - Did you discover who the traitor is ? - Yes ... It 's me . How about that , huh ! ? It 's Quimicefa ! We have to knock down the door ! There 's nothing left . Just this . Well , and this . Fortunately , he was alone , locked in his room . If he weren 't ... We would all blow up . - He killed himself ! - What ? - Why would he kill himself ? - Why ? Because Quimicefa was the traitor . Oh yeah , that 's why he was asking so many questions , that fucker . What does that have to do with him killing himself ? Shut up , you freak ! He killed himself out of remorse . No , he killed himself because he was losing it . He knew you didn 't trust him . That 's right , you remember how he was ? Oh yeah ... yeah ... Alright , we solved the problem , huh ? Tomorrow we collect the 10 mill and we split it three ways ! Oh that 's great ! Now that there 's no more danger , we can relax in peace . We better go to bed . Tomorrow is going to be a tough day . I can explain everything . He wanted to kill you . He told me that many times . He was always in your way , Alex . He was like a stalker , always following you everywhere . You realize that , huh ? You 're finally free of him ! Now you can get an operation with that 5 mill , eh ? And you 'll get him off your back forever . Alright , it 's true . It 's 100 million . 50 for each . You can 't say that I didn 't think of you , eh ? Damn ! Don 't ruin what could be the beginning of a great friendship . You and me against the world , Alex ! We could call ourselves ... " The two from space " , eh ? What do you think ? You 're finished ... without me . You hear me ? You 're nothing more than a genetic flaw . And an idiot . You don 't know how to pilot the ship ! If you kill me you 'll wander in space until you rot , you imbecile . Get up ! No offense taken , eh ? Stop screwing around , you fuck . Get up , or I 'll blow away what 's left of your face ! Alright , alright , whatever you say ... Although it would be better if you 'd give it some thought first , huh ? Danger ! Danger ! Danger ! Danger ! Danger ! Danger ! 100 million divided by one is 100 million , right ? This didn 't turn out so bad after all . I will meet your father in a couple of hours so we can discuss the money . I have to clean myself up a little , or else , what 's your father going to say if he sees me like this ? What was I when my mother gave birth to me ? Number one , the best ! Who made me the man I am today ? Me ! With no help from anybody . And what am I ? I 'm the fucking master ! You should get cleaned up a bit too , eh ? Shit ! Fucking shit ! There Orujo . It 's over . - Are you sure ? - I 'm 98 % sure . - Not good enough , we have to check it out . - So , we proceed with the plan ? Absolutely . Maintain course to Axturias . On command ... But it is impossible that they have survived the crash . Uh ! - Ramón . - What ? I think I was having a dream . Really ? How interesting ! Alright , let 's see ... I think we landed somewhere around here . And now we should be here , yeah . I was getting married , but it went wrong and I killed a hunchback . Then I was on this ship , and I couldn 't speak . Alright , the rendezvous point should be here somewhere ... Here , yes . After that everything just went crazy ... Somebody tried to kill you , but I couldn 't do anything to stop him . It wasn 't a dream . It all happened yesterday . Yes , I thought ... , but it 's as if ... - What are you doing ? - I 'm tying you up . Do you think we should kill my father ? Oh , no , not Stockholm syndrome again . - Not today , eh ? - What ? Shut up ! We 're leaving ! It 's four o 'clock , we 've got five hours to get to the lost mine . Get away ! Dear God , what is this ? Two dying guys sharing a shoulder . - I 'm not so sure about this , Orujo . - What 's wrong now ? We could have problems transporting the material . Don 't start with that . We 're going to finish what we 've started . It 's very unstable . This terrain is very difficult to cross . It could be too dangerous . This is not a game , you hear me ? I 'm going to finish this , if it 's the last thing I do . The intelligentsia oppression of the minorities is obvious , Ay ! The media are hiding the truth in the interest , ay ! of the powerful . It 's amazing to what length the system will go to drive you crazy . We should be around here somewhere . Unless we exploded more due south . Take me for example . 21 years lost , living a life , that wasn 't my real life , alienated . - We should be ... - And my father ? He thought he could buy my love and he bought me a pink pony . I wish we had that pink pony right now ... That 's why I admire you , Ramón , you aren 't deluded . You know we have to react and point out all the flaws of the system . Destroy it , so we can build another one from scratch , a new world , fair , where mutilations will make us equal and where beauty means nothing , only personality . Look , Patricia , don 't make this harder . You were bad enough this morning and this sun is making you even worse . I don 't think you 're taking me seriously . Listen ! We blew up , I don 't know where the fuck we are and we don 't have any water . I 'm tired , I 'm hungry , and I 've got a headache . So just walk , and don 't annoy me anymore . Ramón , you 're so strong . Well , I can 't do much more right now , but at least he won 't decompose for now . - He smells a little ! - It 's the acid I put on him . When the flesh is that badly rotten they react and smell that way , you 'll get used to it . You have to get him off your back as soon as possible , son , you could catch gangrene . What do you think ? He looks like a doll . I 'll fix it . You gave us quite a scare this morning . I thought it was the crazy miners , they would kill anything , just for fun . - Oh , yeah ? - Yes , they are very dangerous . The gas from the mines makes them crazy . One thing 's for sure : they like it . Do you know where The Lost Mine bar is ? Which ? Garcia 's bar ? It 's not what it used to be . Since they 've reduced the prices of carbon on Earth , they haven 't stopped firing miners . - Could you show me the way ? - Why such a hurry ? Stay here for a couple of days , get some rest and we 'll finish dissecting your brother . I have a meeting there , a meeting I can 't miss . A score you have to settle ? Yes , that 's it ! There 's a woman involved to . - A woman ! - Yes , that 's right . You mean there 's going to be a woman in Garcia 's bar ? I 'm sure of it , that fucker will bring her there , stupid as he is . My God ! Maybe I 'll get to see her ! Quick ! We have no time to lose ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! I 'll make us some sandwiches and we 'll leave as soon as possible . What 's gotten into you now , eh ? Don 't you understand , moron ? There 's no women on Axturias ! You know what , Ramón ? I think I know what 's troubling you . Man , there 's gotta be an easier way to make money . You 're depressed because you killed all your friends , and that 's no small thing . Sometimes you have to do some things , even if you don 't want to . And if someone is in your way , you have to deal with him , period . And move on . I know it 's tough . You 're tired and depressed . You feel like everything you did was in vain . Everybody hates you . You hate yourself , too , huh ? Is that it , Ramón ? Are you listening to me ? Tell me ! Relax , okay ? Let 's not ruin this . You 're a professional . You can handle this . Let 's not lose our heads now , and ruin years of work . I know what I said upset you ... No , What upsets me is that I don 't have a stapler with me . Was it because I said you 're depressed ? Ramón ? Listen to me good , Patricia , I 'm only going to tell you this once . If you start talking about what 's bothering me , I 'll cut your feet off . I 'll only get half the money , but I 'll keep my sanity . You understand ? O.K. Shit ! Why does everything have to be complicated ? Where did you come from ? Just what I need : an idiot . Stop it , damn it ! Alright , where do you live ? Where do you live ? Where do you live ? There , huh ? - Have you found the ship ? - Yes , or something like it . There aren 't any signs of life . It 's possible they died at the landing . No , they 're here . I can smell them ... Quickly , we have to get to the rendezvous point before nightfall . I thought we 'd never see anyone . We 've been walking all day ... We had an accident , about 30 kilometers from here . The truth is we don 't know where we are . We 're looking for a bar that ... Good day ... Shut up , damn it ! There 's a woman outside . I told you not to stay in the sun . - It 's bad for you . - No , it 's true , grandpa . - And there 's a guy who wants water . Leave the kid alone . You always pick on him cuz he 's little . He 's on the porch playing with the dog . Hi , what 's up ? I was just telling these guys that we had an accident and ... The story began with the problem of 100 million . We didn 't know exactly if there were 10 or 100 million . Yes , I saw it on TV . I don 't know if you ... No , I don 't think you saw it . - I can 't watch TV . - On the news . That 's how the problem started . - So , he killed all of you ? - One by one , slowly . He 's smart and tough . and he doesn 't make assumptions . - A champion . - I wouldn 't say that . - Let 's just say he got lucky . - Luck always runs out my friend . - Are you talking to me ? - No , man . I mean him . He was my best friend and now I have to kill him . - Money ruins everything . - And women too . Yes . Women ruin things too . More care for pussy hair than for keeping the boat afloat . But ... Do you love her ? Man , I ... I don 't know . With my brother always around , it wasn 't easy being alone with a woman . So you never ... Never what ? You never said anything to Patricia . Ah , no , she doesn 't know anything yet . Let 's hope nothing bad happens to her . So you want to know how to get to Garcia 's bar ? Yes , It 's easy , if you know the way . Eat . Eat all you want , darling . No , I haven 't much of an appetite . There 's enough food here , what 's missing is someone to cook it ... There 's not a lot of women around here , you know ? My nephews have never seen one before ... in the flesh . What do you think ? Cute kid . How old is he ? 10 I think . You must excuse him , I don 't let him to talk to strangers . And his mother ? Died when the kids were still little . She was a nice woman . We bought her in a colony in the valley . But honestly , she wasn 't very sturdy . You know how delicate women are . Sell her to me . I 'll give you everything I have . - She 's worth 100 million . - What was that ? He said 100 million ! Alright , alright ! I 'll give you 200,000 ecus and 200 videos , that 's everything I have . Forget it . She 's not for sale . Ramón , let 's get out of here , I have a bad feeling . It 's O.K. Looks like we won 't be able to convince you . - Zacharías , go to your room . - But , why ? - Let me stay a little longer ! - I said go to your room . We 're gonna kill this man . Alright , alright . It would be a shame to ruin dinner . We 're all civilized here , right ? Let 's work something out . How about I rent her ? It would only take an hour . Remember you don 't know how to get to Garcia 's bar . After all , what 's an hour ? Nothing ! What do you think ? No deal . I don 't have time and I don 't like videos . I 'm very sorry . Some other time . Patricia , let 's go , we have a date with your father . You can sit down . What are you doing ? Leave that and let 's go ! Tie him up tightly ! Zacharías , go get my shaver ! Boys , you don 't know what a good time we 're about to have ! Under this tree I declared love to a woman , who was to be my wife , 20 years ago . - Did you love her ? - Did I love her ? Of course I loved her . She was a nice woman . We bought her in a colony in the valley . But honestly , she wasn 't very sturdy . You know how delicate women are , It makes me sick just thinking that she 's with him . Stop thinking about that . You 'll have your revenge in a couple of hours , and the girl . That 's the idea , right ? Yes , that 's the idea . It 's just ... - What ? - I don 't know . And if anything goes wrong ? Why would anything go wrong ? I don 't know , but it does every time . Right , until now . Relax , everything will go perfectly . For the first time you 're alone , no family and no bosses . And plus you 've met this girl . What more do you want ? I didn 't look at it this way ... Do you think a girl like that could fall in love with someone like me ? Of course ! Why not ? A woman is a mystery ... at least that 's what they say ... This time you have to be determined , no beating around the bush , get right to the point ... And if it goes wrong ... The important thing is to participate . Don 't they say that to ? Look , first you kiss her and then we 'll see . - I won 't know what to say to her . Look , I 'm going to give you some advice about women that you 'll never forget . The crazy miners ! Run , you moron ! Shut up already ! - What nerve . - Remove , pussy . She hit me . I 'll go first and I 'll explain to you how it 's done . You just watch your grandpa do it . Aren 't you going ? Grandpa , grandpa , I want to go too . Alright , son , close the door ... from the outside . They want her for themselves , eh ? They 're having all the fun in there and you out here getting bored , eh ? We could be friends . I know a lot of games . Why don 't you untie me and I 'll show you some ? No , no , no . Easy , easy . Let 's make a deal . If you let me go , I 'll go in there and give them a few punches so they will take you seriously , huh , rascal ? What are you doing ? No , no , no ! Wait , wait a minute ... No ! Motherfuckers ! Motherfuckers ! Motherfuckers ! Motherfuckers ! Motherfuckers ! I 'm getting bored . Let 's go somewhere else where there 's more people . O.K. Motherfuckers , motherfuckers ! Motherfuckers ! Motherfuckers ! What happened ? Where are we ? Everything is under control . Go back to sleep . You need it . We 've got another 15 minutes of driving before we get to the lost mine . And this map ? I 've traded something for it with the kid . He 's adorable . Zacharías ! Get in here this minute ! No , you 're gonna beat me ! I 'm not going to hurt you , son , just come here . - Is there gas in the excavator ? - There 's some . Prepare it ; we 're going to the lost mine . - Just like the old times , eh ? - Shut up ! That bitch is pissing me off . This is the right way . That 's the hangman 's tree . What the fuck are you looking at , shithead ? ! Turn out the lights , Mariluz , turn out the lights ... I can 't live with so much light . The drunk in the cemetery ... play all mus ... How 's the food here ? Fuck ! Calm down , Orujo , or we 'll attract too much attention . I hate this planet . You 've got what you wanted , I should be going . - Will it be enough ? - I 've doubled it . Once it 's activated , you can 't stop it . I don 't want any fuck-ups . When this fucker comes near , he 's going to eat it , I assure you . The blast radius is very wide , Orujo . The explosion won 't go out through his ass . That is my concern ... I don 't want to interfere in your business , but will you be able to kill him and not hurt your daughter in the process ? I 'm not paying you to ask questions , but because you 're the best in the business . Stick to that . This is between that son of a bitch and me . I don ' know how this is going to end , and I don 't want to . It 's absurd and I don 't like it . What 's up dad , everything under control ? Listen , the television crew wants to talk to you . They 're outside . Who ? The television crew . You know how they are . They called me to ask about the ransom money . I thought they weren 't coming . Let 's go . No time to lose . We have to send them away . Damn it ! It 's almost time . Hey , you , with the doll , get out of the way ! - It 's a ventriloquist , grandpa ! - Or a mime . I need you to take me to the lost mine . Today we 're all going to the lost mine . Climb on , hurry . I like the pipiribipipi lifting of the boot , parabapapa . with the pipiribipipi , with the paparabapapa , who does not like wine , is an animal ... One whisky with plenty of ice , García . Me too , make it double . And where are the others ? We ran into trouble . Ramón , be careful , Orujo was here . And the police ? They didn 't show up yet . That 's bad . They 're buying . Thank you . So , what are we going to do with my father 's money , boss ? okay ... Let 's see if we can get this straight for the last time , Patricia . Where do I start ... okay . - I kidnapped you , you remember ? - Yes . So , that makes me a kidnapper . And I 'm doing this to get the money , understand ? Obviously . And who are you ? You 're the victim . - You 're forced to be here . - No . I 'm here because I want to be . No , no , no ... You are here ... against your will . You don 't understand it now , but later , when you get home , with your dad , you 'll hate me for all the things I 've done to you . But I don 't hate you . I love you . Patricia , you 're sick . You 're suffering from Stockholm syndrome . Now I get it . Don 't say anything more . - Patricia ... - Leave me ! Patricia , come here . - Come here , I said . - Leave me , Don 't touch me ! Excuse me , miss , is he bothering you ? We 're just fine , Thank you . I 'm not talking to you , snailhead , I 'm talking to the lady . She can 't speak , she 's mentally ill . And if I break your jaw , then what ? Look , I don 't want any trouble , so leave us ... Ramón ... Excuse us for a moment , eh ? Lets go , here ! Quickly , quickly ! Ready ? Roll at will . This is Jaime Blanch for J.Q.K. , live from the lost mine bar . In a few moments we 'll see the outcome of the kidnapping of the year . Let 's leave the presentations ! We are waiting ... In this very moment Mr. Orujo the millionaire industrialist , and father of the victim has entered . Mr. Orujo , could you tell the viewers of the J.Q.K. A few ... Obviously ... due to the excitement of the moment , Mr. Orujo doesn 't want to give any statements . But now his son in law is entering the bar , maybe he 'll take the time to talk to us . Could you tell us sir ? How are the negotiations going ? Well , I don 't think at this moment , we should rush to any conclusions but anyway , I would like to thank the state and the police for the help they 've given us from the beginning and I want to express my outrage and disgust for similar criminal acts ... O. K ! That 's enough . Thank you very much . We 'll proceed with our live coverage . But first a few messages from our sponsors . Every breakfast is a trip ... with Trippies . Trippies , the colored acid cereal . Looks like you 're even dumber than I thought . Not only the police , but now you 've brought the TV news . I didn 't call them , but don 't worry , they won 't interfere . Here , I 've got the money in unmarked bills inside the antifusion suitcase . Now , release my daughter ! Looks like there 's been a change of plans . Who is going to collect the ransom ? We continue live on J.Q.K. You are hearing this ? Alright , someone bring me the suitcase and I 'll let the girl go . Me ! I 'll do it . Excuse me . Hello ! What 's up ? Looks like the victim 's boyfriend , Luis María de Ostolaza , is going to be the one who delivers the suitcase to the kidnapper . Yes , he 's got the case . The victim is being released and ... Looks like there 's a problem ... - We got the money ! - What are you doing ? Let him go ! - Patricia , come here ! - Patricia , go to your father ! Patricia , it 's me ... Luis Mari ... Ostolaza . Shut up ! Don 't tell me what to do ! Novelillas ? Pumbys ... What the fuck is this ? Enough with this fucking bullshit ! I 've had it with the cameras and the clowns in uniform like you . This is no joke , Orujo . You just don 't get it . I 've got all of my guys here , aiming at your head . You hear me ? Because you didn 't bring the money , no one will leave this place alive . That is exactly what is going to happen , you fucker ! No one is gonna leave this place , not the commentator , not the miners , not you , not this whore here , not me ! Me neither ! We 're all going to die , You hear me ? Everyone ! Right after I squeeze this button . You know ? I think I 've totally lost it ... I 've got nothing to lose . 45 years trying to succeed in a job that I hate and when the happiest day of my life comes , the wedding of my only daughter , a group of knuckleheads shows up and kills all of my guests . And my daughter too ! Because you 're not my daughter ! My daughter died , violated by terrorists who took her innocence . You whore ! What are you looking at , you fucks ? You think anyone is getting out of here ? You , sing something , god damn it ! A mí me gusta el pipiriripipi ... The moment of the Apocalypse has come . Prepare to die ! Mr. Orujo was right , prepare to die , motherfucker . Alex , You 're alive ! Yes , no thanks to you . I 've came to kill you . - Terrific ! - Release her , you pig ! Jump , damn it ! Come on , let 's get her ! Move your ass ! This is a hard one , Yarritu ! Well , it 's not the first time , García . Yeah , that 's true . - Give me a gun , I want to shoot ! - Get down , Patricia ! Go ! If you don 't get out , I 'll rip your guts out ! What 's going on ? Attention ! Members of the Mutant Movement , this is the police . We 've got you surrounded . There 's no escape . Come out with your hands up and you won 't get hurt . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! I 'm on television ! I 'm going to count to 3 , then come out : 1 , 2 ... Ah , they got me ! It 's almost better . This whole bar thing ... it wasn 't a good idea , García . Ramón , this girl ... is not the right one for you . Damn ! Shit ! What 's wrong , eh , what 's wrong ? We are out of bullets , that 's what , and the police are waiting for us outside . Patricia , the bomb ! The bomb ! The bomb ! Give me that . You 're still useless , Alex . Stop it , stop it ! We gotta get out of here , eh ? We 'll go together . There 's something new in their stride . Now they 're alone , but their memory will be with them . We 'll go together . Your friends and their ideas ... won 't be forgotten . We 'll go together . When you feel something strong inside , nothing else matters . We 'll go together . They are mutilated , but still have arms to fight , and won 't forget . We are few , but soon will be many , Many more ! Many more ! Behold , we rise again ! Behold , we rise again ! Action , vengeance , violence , progress ! Armed with a conscience , we take up the cause , Vengeance for the victims of Mount Taigeto . Blind justice , justice in braille . For the disfigured and mutilated , the dance has already begun . Bodybuilders impaled , we burn the gymnasiums . in the sauna they cook : They are worms . and with lampshades made from the scrotums of cyclists , bribes to tighten the cords of tightrope walkers .

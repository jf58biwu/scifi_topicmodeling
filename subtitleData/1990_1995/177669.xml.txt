Hey , right now , for a limited time only , you can watch me stomp the stuffings out of Terrax , Super Skrull , The Sub Mariner , and a whole mess of other famous grungy creeps . Thanks to the Fantastic Four 's own home video , my greatest adventures are now yours to enjoy when you buy my famous collector 's edition tape , called It 's Clobberin ' Time ! , starring yours truly . Hey , it 's only a measly 29.95 . So get off your butts , get on the phone , whip out some of that plastic , and let me hear that cash register go ding-a-ling-a-dong . Everybody here at HTSN is thrilled that The Thing picked us to make this wonderful video available to you , but you better hurry . Ben said he had a surprise for me , but what 's he doing selling video tapes ? [ woman ] I 'll tell you what he 's doing , he 's disgracing this building and me . Everyone in New York knows that moronic orange dump-truck lives here , Mrs. Richards . I sympathize , Miss Forbes , but Ben 's an adult . I can 't control him . Then perhaps Dr. Richards can . Come along , Foo Foo . [ barks ] [ man ] Computer , lock coordinates with Hubble Telescope and access image-enhancement protocols . [ computer ] Coordinates locked , protocols accessed . Interfacing . Stand by to record my observations . [ computer ] Recording . [ electronic pulsing ] Amazing ! Matter runs down into that black hole like water down a drain . But if my theory is correct , it will enter a negative zone and become anti-matter as it exits . Then , as it recirculates , transforms itself into ... Good grief ! It 's the Negative Zone planetary system itself ! Its planets orbit the backwash of a black hole instead of around a sun . One of the planets seems to be a world of inversión . Gravity and physical laws reversed , with strange , dreadful inhabitants of unbelievable power . Computer , scan and analyze that bizarre rod that creature is ... - What ? ! - [ barking ] I want your undivided attention , Dr. Richards . So I pulled your plug . [ Sue ] I 'm sorry , sweetheart , she insisted on seeing you . [ Reed ] Very well , but disconnecting my experiment when you did was unwise and dangerous , Miss Forbes . The forces I was monitoring are very powerful , their effects unpredictable . - [ Johnny ] Look out ! - [ girl ] What 's happening ? - [ Miss Forbes ] Gor blimey ! - [ Sue ] Reed ! [ dog barks ] [ Johnny ] Big time bizarre . Now you 've put a hole in my wall . Reed , what is that ? [ hisses , growls ] [ speech-like growls ] Reed , what is he ? I don 't know , but something caused a tear in the fabric of our dimensión and he came out of it . You have nothing to fear from us . We will not harm you . Get away from me , you grotesque cucaracha . [ speech-like growling ] [ Miss Forbes ] Yaaah ! - [ Reed ] Johnny ! - Flame on ! It 's a stand-off . I don 't think he 's afraid of fire . [ more growling ] [ Miss Forbes ] Oh , my ! [ glass breaking ] [ Johnny ] That entrance to whatever . Something else is coming ! I 've got to seal it off before we get any more strange visitors . [ stretching ] [ Forbes ] This will destroy the value of my property and it 's all your fault ! Oh , darling , you did it . That 's only part of the problem . That insectoid creature is loose somewhere in New York . And we don 't know how dangerous it is . We 've got to find it and send it back where it came from . [ car horns beeping ] [ Ben ] Come on , out there , keep ordering my video . It 's a lot better than them crummy porcelain pigs they usually sell here . [ growls ] [ growls ] ... crummy porcelain pigs they usually sell here ... [ man ] I don 't know what you want , ace , but we aren 't hosting a Halloween party here . Get lost . [ whispering growl ] What is it with you ? Don 't you understand English ? [ monster ] I did not but now I do ! I am Annihilus , lord of the Planet Tyanna . I herewith claim this world ! Accept my rule or die ! [ woman ] Yes , shut ins , these enchanting porcelain pigs from the Age of Enlightenment are next here on the Home Town Shopping Network . Ask for Sir Reginald Swine at only 79.95 . Then you can buy his friend , Lady Fanny Pork for $ 59 ... [ rocket slowing down ] You can 't come in here . We 're on air . - [ Ben ] Hey . - Ben , we need you . - Hurry . - Give me a raincheck , Stretcho . I still got tapes to unload . But a strange creature from another dimensión is loose in the city . Whoa , hey , hey ! What 's with you ? [ Reed ] This is serious , Ben . This city and perhaps the world itself is in grave danger . This is Sam Jaggers of Hard News on special assignment in New York City , where you are watching an incredible insectoid mutant calling himself Annihilus , as he constructs what appears to be his living quarters high above the fashionable midtown area . And it looks like the law has finally decided to do something about this weird intruder . Let 's listen in . [ policeman ] You , there on the building . You 're trespassing and have no building permit . For the last time , cease and desist or we 'll arrest you . Ahhh ! [ Reed ] Prepare to disengage . Disengage ! Do the pincers movement , Johnny . Now ! [ Reed ] The choppers are in free fall . Hurry ! - [ Johnny ] Got ' em , sis . - [ Reed ] Great work , Sue , Johnny . Set them down safely and join Ben and me as soon as possible . We 've got to learn exactly what we 're dealing with . - We mean you no harm . - [ Annihilus growls ] Stay back , or be destroyed ! [ Reed ] We can help you return to your own dimensión . [ Ben ] Yeah , Bug Eyes , we want to be pals . [ Annihilus ] Keep back ! Back ! He appears to be priming his control rod for maximum power . On three , focus all positive energy beams on him . One , two , now ! Uhhh ! [ Annihilus shouts ] [ Johnny ] Anti-matter shards ! [ Reed ] Refocus your energy beams now ! Hey , look at the Whosis ! [ Reed ] He 's dematerialized . And there 's no way to know where he 'll come back into this dimensión . We 've got to do some homework , fast . [ Sue ] How can we defeat someone whose power equals anything we throw at him ? [ Reed ] The problem 's worse than that . Our energy derives from our dimensión . His emanates from the anti-matter Negative Zone which exists inside a mysterious black hole in space . Right . It 's all on account of the anti-matter no parking zone . Thanks for clearing things up . Where 's Waldo Pizza ? You find us no matter where we are ? Yeah , it 's me again . Give me the pepperoni , salami , garlic combo with anchovies . Oh , but hold the onions . You see , I got a lady friend visiting . [ electronic pulsing ] [ Girl ] I hope I 'm not interrupting . You 've been working so long , I thought you might enjoy a tea break . Oh , thank you , Alicia . I always love watching Ben stick out his little finger when he slurps out of the saucer . Hey , hey , don 't knock my manners , firefly . I ain 't the one who eats chicken soup with his hands . Reed , the inter-dimensional doorway . [ monster ] Free ! Free ! In a new dimensión to conquer ! Ha ha ! Annihilus , I would know his stench , even on the Dead Plains of the Jackal Worid of Arrrl ! Hey , I like this guy . He makes me look like Brian Austin Green . There 's no room for Annihilus and me . I am Blastaar ! I must rule alone ! Raarrgghh ! Raarrgghh ! I don 't like this . Our problem has just more than doubled . Unless we can find a way to counter the effects of anti-matter in this dimensión , our world is doomed . We must follow him . I 'm giving it everything , but that blue-whiskered jerk is still ahead of us . [ Annihilus ] Ahhh , sustenance . What the ... ? Aaaah ! Good ! Eat heartily , Annihilus , it is your last meal . [ growls ] [ Blastaar ] Come now , I must practice the language of this new dimensión , which I shall conquer and plunder . [ Annihilus ] Yaaar ! [ growls ] Let me hear you say farewell to your life ! Arrghh ! [ Annihilus ] You were right , Blastaar ! There will be no sharing . Earth will be mine alone ! Amazing ! According to my sensors , Annihilus has absorbed enough radiation to vaporize New York . But his system has converted it into non-radioactive anti-matter . It 's clobberin ' time ! [ whistling of Ben falling ] Yeow ! Ooof ! [ thud of raining blows ] [ high-pitched humming ] I 'm sorry , Officer , I didn 't see the off ramp . [ hissing and growling ] Only one of us shall remain to rule ! I invoke the challenge of Algestus Kax ! A fight to the death . Winner take all ! I accept . And the choice of field is mine ! There on the highest battlement . [ Blastaar ] We meet in one hour , earth time ! That doesn 't give us much time to learn how to neutralize them . [ Reed ] If we don 't find a way to return them to the Negative Zone , the human race could become slaves to either Blastaar or Annihilus . It 's like the door into the Negatory Zone wasn 't never there . [ Reed ] That 's because the precise moment in which a confluence of diverse energy-producing events caused a tear in our dimensional fabric has passed . But Blastaar and Annihilus will meet in combat in less than 40 minutes . And we don 't have the resources to defeat them . Is it hopeless ? No , Sue . Not if we find the key to re-open that inter-dimensional doorway . I 've reproduced the experiment I was working on when the tear in the dimensional fabric appeared . But so far it hasn 't produced results . It 's pizza guy ! Okay , who belongs to the pepperoni , salami , garlic combo ? Is pizza the surprise you promised me , Ben ? No way . Just wait . My surprise is a doozy . Ah , yo , pizza guy . We get your combo . - Reed , a combo ! - Of course ! It was a combination of energy-related events that ripped a hole in this dimensión in the first place . That was brilliant , sweetheart ! I thought so too . I learned from the best . I ... I don 't get it . We 're going to re-create the exact combination of events which tore the fabric of this dimensión , and pray it 's the key to the Negative Zone . Ben , you must get the Home Town Shopping Network to re-run your appearance at once . Say what ? Yo , friends , that 's right , it 's me , your blue-eyed , blushing ' , ever-lovin ' Thing . Right now , for a limited time only ... While I was tapping into the Telescope 's coverage of that black hole in space , Ben was on the Home Town Shopping Network which was receiving thousands of calls by way of a communications satellite . I believe a spontaneous interface took place which was then interrupted . Now , Miss Forbes , please . This is the most ridiculous exercise in stupidity I ... Just pull the cockamamie plug ! Oh , yes , yes , of course , of course ! And be sure Foo Foo barks . His sound is part of the energy equation . Oh , speak , Foo Foo , speak . Bark , you shrimp . - [ Alicia ] It 's happening ! - [ Ben ] Way to go ! [ Miss Forbes ] Good grief ! It worked ! Now to reprogram the Fantasticar for inter-dimensional travel . And then to the top of The Worid Trade Center . Blastaar and Annihilus should be facing off for the final conflict in exactly 12 minutes . Can 't you wait to observe protocol ? I have no patience for ritual . Die , usurper ! There isn 't a moment to spare . The buildings are shaking down to their foundations . Your new doohickey sure don 't look like much . What if it don 't work ? [ Reed ] Then we could be stuck in the Negative Zone forever . At least the world would be free of Blastaar and Annihilus . Ready , Johnny , Ben , Sue ? - [ Johnny ] All set . - [ Sue ] Yes . [ Ben ] One for the money , two for the show ... - [ Reed ] Now ! - [ Johnny ] Flame on ! Geronimo ! [ electric jangling ] Hurry , Ben , Johnny . I can 't hold them much longer . Uh ! Haagh ! [ Ben ] Gotcha ! [ Reed ] Now drive us through the spaceItime barrier into the Negative Zone . [ whoosh ] [ Blastaar ] Release me ! I do not wish to return now ! When I jettison cargo , hold on tight and whatever you do , don 't open your eyes . Ready ? Jettisoning ! You shall pay for this indignity ! [ Blastaar ] All who meddle with the will of Blastaar die ! They 're coming right at us ! [ Reed ] I said close your eyes ! [ buzzing electricity ] [ whoosh , high-pitched whine ] Oh , Ben , you 're back safely . The inter-dimensional window which opened onto the Negative Zone has been sealed . Which leaves only one question still unanswered . What was Ben doing on the Home Town Shopping Network ? I needed a little bread for Alicia 's surprise . Here , kid . You can even ride it to the supermarket . Oh , Ben ! ¶ There 's Galactus looking hungry ¶ And ol ' Doctor Doom is near ¶ Here come the Skrulls invading ¶ Do you run and hide in fear ? ¶ No way , no way , no way ¶ Just call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four ¶ That 's all , no more Now , that 's grammatical ¶ Reed Richards is elastic ¶ Sue can fade from sight ¶ Johnny is the Human Torch ¶ The Thing just loves to fight ¶ Call for the Four ¶ Fantastic Four

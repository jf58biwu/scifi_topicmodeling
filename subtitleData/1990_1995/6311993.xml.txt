 - the name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years , I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now ... Well , let 's just say , " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - How are we doing ? - Estimated atmospheric entry about 30 seconds , major . - Stay on it . - You bet . - Where 's it gonna hit ? - Projected impact Area is eastern edge of the bay , and the ocean beyond . So track and chart every damn fragment ! Hey , no problem . Most of it 'll burn up in the atmosphere . I don 't care ! I can 't afford to take any chances ! Understood ? Yes , ma 'am . Heaven help us , if we lose it . - Oh , boy ! You 've really done it this time . - Nope- - You heard me right . - Skiles , you barely know the girl . - Oh , believe me , Mr. Butler , I know her well enough . And , her and me are in love . - Well , in that case , there 's only one thing I can say . - Oh ? - Congratulations ! - Oh ! - Looks like you 've got yourself some fireworks to celebrate the occasion . - Whoa ! - Let 's go take a look ! - Yeah . - Skiles , get the Bales ! - Okay , Mr. Butler ! - Fantastic ! - Mr. Butler ! - Ah ! - Mr. Butler ! Oh-Oh , please ! Oh , geez ! Hang on , Mr. Butler- - I 'll get help ! - I 'm fine , Skiles . Just help me get to my feet . - Okay , Mr. Butler . You sure you 're okay ? - Yeah . - Oh , thanks be . The darn thing must 've picked up a whole bunch of static on the way down . I gotta admit , you had me scared there , for awhile . Geez , what is that thing ? - Oh , Bertha , you 're just too good to me . What is it today ? - Urchin stew . It 's good and healthy , but only if you eat it , Virginia . - Oh , urchins- - In this heat ? - Now , don 't start with me . - Okay , okay . Did you hear- - The gushongs moved out yesterday ? One day , you got neighbors- - the next , rats . - Well , I 'm not going anywhere . This is our home . - I know , I know . Here .. for you . - Oh , it 's beautiful ! - I thought you needed a little color in your life . - Peter ... Who could Peter be ? - I have no idea- - why don 't you ask her ? - She put that box of chocolates on her desk , just to bug me . I know it . - Not that it does . You know , one of these days , you and Jane are gonna have to stop stringing each other along . - " man 's inhumanity to man . " You know who said that ? - Uh , nope . - me neither . Lucky thing we 're tarns ! - He came by again- - The new landlord . He made me another offer . - oh ! - Sure is in a hurry to empty this place . - But you told him where to get off , right ? - Well , uh ... it 's a lot of money , Bertha ! - Oh ! - Oh , I know- - I know ! You 're right- - This is our home . - that 's my gal- - See ya later , Virginia . - Okay . - excuse me , gentlemen . - Oh , lady wants to get past . What do you think ? Should we move aside ? - Ooh , I 'm kinda comfortable standing here , myself . And you ? - Yeah . - What do you want ? - Whatever you got . - Ooh , nice ! - Yeah . Oops ! - How dare you ! - Ooh ! - Do you think she can fly ? - Uh , let 's find out . - Brogan , haldane , mugging in progress . Roetem towers . Contact a mrs . Newton , top floor . - We 're there , fredo . - Ow ! - Where is she ? - There . - Leave me alone ! - Look , there 's no way I can set her down here . Um , you wanna jump ? - Help me , please- - Please , help me ! - Just get me close . - Please- - Please , hurry ! Please , help me ! - Right there ! - I 'll work my way back up from the street ! Break a leg ! - Right . You all right ? - Oh , don 't just stand there ! Go get ' em ! - Yes , ma 'am- - Stay put ! Brogan . - I 'm with ya . First floor- - Workin ' my way up the stairs . - I got the 12th . - Did you get ' em ? - I thought I told you to wait inside . - I thought you might need some help . - Ah ! Uh , nothin ' my way . They didn 't use the stairs . - Wait a minute- - You 're bleeding . - Oh , it 's nothing . - Let 's get this gal to e.R. - I 'm not a gal- - I have a name ! Bertha fluss , and it 'll take more than a couple of punks to put me in the hospital . - Uh , did you , uh , know these punks , mrs . Fluss ? - I never set eyes on them before , sergeant . - All right , well , tell you what , mrs . Fluss . Why don 't you come back to the station with me and the sergeant , and we 'll take care of that arm and get a statement . Okay ? - That 's it- - I am movin ' out ! I don 't need this kinda grief ! - What 's the matter ? Didn 't you finish your breakfast ? - Oh , very funny . She wants me to call if I 'm gonna be late for dinner . What next , a curfew ? - There 's only one way to handle a woman . You gotta stand up and tell her how you feel . Be forceful , be direct ! - To my mom ? - What are you , a creon , or a wimp ? Oh , no- - I don 't believe it ! It 's the beast ! - What ? - Bertha fluss- - the beast of " Astronomics 101 . " - One of your high school teachers ? - Shh ! - Please , make sure you wash and change the dressing every day , mrs . Fluss . - Is that all they teach you at medical school , these days ? - She 'll be fine . Nice meeting you , mrs . Fluss . - Ma 'am . - Silas romek ... is that you ? Well , of course , it is ! Who else , with that terrible posture ? You know , very well , who I am . - Sure , he does . - Oh , yeah , mrs . Fluss ! I-I-I didn 't recognize you . How ya doin ' ? - I always thought you 'd end up in a police station , but I never imagined it would be on this side of the bars . - Well , we do let him out , every once in awhile . Come on , mrs . Fluss , let 's see if we can get a memory fit on the guys that attacked you . - wimp ! - Mmm ! - Honey , uh , I 'm in the middle of my work day , here . Look , I 'll let you in on a little secret . When I was your age , I almost didn 't pass my own midterms . - Great- - Mom 's still at work . What am I supposed to do ? - What 's Matt doing ? - Well , he 's not helping me . - All right . Well , you tell him to help you , or else . I 'll be home as soon as I can . - Matt , dad said , " or else . " - Be still , now , and recall the events , mrs . Fluss . - the thing is , he 's been missing for weeks . Look , I brought you some pictures . - This isn 't really a police matter , you know ? Have you spoken to missing persons ? - I have . - and ? - Nothing . - Well , who 's the other guy ? - That 's his boss . Randall Butler . He hasn 't heard anything either . Look , there must be something you can do . People don 't just disappear ! - Well , it 's a free planet . You say you two were planning to get married . Is it possible Mr. Skiles got cold feet ? - You think I 'm making this whole thing up ? - No , no . What officer took is trying to say is that , unless we have evidence of foul play ... we can 't do anything . - Great . Thanks a lot for your help- - Thanks . - Oh , maybe I should give the coroner another call . See if anything 's turned up . - You see , I don 't understand . I got a good look at those boys . I should 've given the sketch artist a better picture . - It 's all right , Bertha . Memory fit 's not an exact science . - Well , don 't patronize me , officer ! - I think what officer haldane is trying to say- - - I know what he 's saying ! Those thugs frightened me more than I realized , and it 's affected my memory of the incident . Look at this place ! No wonder there 's a crime wave around here . - Yeah , you oughta speak to your landlord . This is pretty rundown . - Oh , you can say that again . - Mrs. Fluss ! - Oh , hello , Borden . Gentlemen , this is my landlord , Randall Borden . Lieutenant Brogan and officer haldane . - nice to meet you , officers . Mrs. Newton just told me what happened . It must 've been terrible . Are you all right ? - Major , action on camera five . - But , surely , you see the difference . - I suppose , but it 's pretty tenuous , skid . I mean , language is about communication . Huh ? - Exactly ! That 's why it 's so important to use it right . Not just content , pal . Form- - That 's the key . - Old age is for the birds ! If I 'd been a few years Younger , those punks would 've been walkin ' around with only two eyes , right now ! - What is done , is done , Bertha . Now , drink up your cocoa . I 've added a little potassium to realign your metabolism . - I 'm glad they invented you , Rocky . Sometimes , it 's as if Mr. Fluss had never died . - Companionship is my function . Given that , Bertha , I would be grateful if you would inform me when you are expecting company . - What on altor are you talkin ' about ? - Nice crib you got here , lady . - Whatever you want , just take it , and leave me alone . - Oh , now , you don 't really mean that , do ya ? - Oh ! Is that what you wanted ? - Rocky , call the police . - of course . - Rocky ! - Wouldn 't that have been easier ? - Sure , But not as much fun ! - You swine ! - Where 'd the old bag go ? - Oh , no ! No ! Let me out ! - Sleep tight , Bertha . - Now , we 'll leave you alone . - No , you can 't leave me here ! - How about a nice , cool drink ? - Suits me . - Please ! - They 're on their way . - send in the unit . - Bertha ? - Oh , please , help me , please . - Bertha ? Bertha ? - I-I 'm in here . - Bertha , is that you- - You in there ? - I 'm in here . - All right , all right . All right . - I 'm in here ! - Stand back- - I 'm gonna kick the door ! - All right , Officer . - It 's all right- - It 's okay . Okay , it 's all right- - Come on , come on . It 's all right- - Tell me what happened . - They came back ! I don 't understand ! This place was a mess ! They killed my Rocky- - My robot ! - There you are , Bertha . Whatever happened to you last night ? - Rocky ! Don 't you remember ? - The last event I recall was that you were popping up the stairs to see mrs . Newton . You never returned . - No , I don 't understand ! They were here ! I swear , on my husband 's grave ! - Look , mrs . Fluss , the attack yesterday was very traumatic . - You think I 'm losing my mind , don 't you ? - No , no . - Well , what about being locked in the trash room ? Did I dream that , too ? - No . Look , I will admit , something very weird is going on around here . - You 're tellin ' me . - Look , mrs . Fluss , why don 't you stay with some friends for a few days ? - This is my home , Officer- - I 'm not going anywhere . And I 'm not goin to a shelter , either . So , don 't ask ! - Okay , all right . What do you wanna do ? - I want protection- - I am a citizen ! I 've paid more taxes than you 've earned wages . Now , that should count for something . - Yeah . - is this for me , Officer ? - Yeah ... and I have a name . It 's Jack . - Thank you ... Jack . - You gotta be kidding me , haldane ! - Come on , captain- - An attempt was made on her life ! - What evidence do you have for that ? Were there any signs of a struggle ? - Well , no , but ... she has no reason to lie . - Loneliness is a strange thing , haldane . It feeds the imagination . - Uh , captain , for what it 's worth , mrs . Fluss doesn 't seem like the hysterical type . - What-What is this ? You 're police officers , not psychiatrists . If you wanna help her , contact social services . - Captain , wait- - Somethin ' is definitely happening ' down there . - What ? - Uh ... - Come on , haldane , tell me . What is happening down there ? Fellas , go catch me some criminals , huh ? - But ... - All right , dando , and thanks for your help . That was the coroner 's Office . No one matching Skiles description . - This is a strange one . - Why 'd you say that ? - Well , suppose he did get cold feet . He wouldn 't disappear completely , would he ? - Well , maybe we should put slomo on this . See what he can dig up . - Hey , man , don 't worry about Bertha . We 'll make a couple of extra stops on patrol . The other guys 'll do the same . - So , you believe her , then ? - Well , I didn 't say that . Look , why don 't you go give her a call , and I 'll run a background search on This new landlord . All right ? - Hey , loverboy . I hear you 've been seeing an older woman . - don 't start with me , castle . Looks like somebody 's doin pretty good , though , huh ? - You 're not jealous , are you ? - Say " Hi " to Peter for me . - Hey , haldane , how 's your love life ? - Excuse me ? - You seem pretty chummy with Bertha the beast . - You know , romek , I can answer that , but , for some reason , I don 't think you 'd get the point . - Hey , it was a joke . - Yeah , well , from what I heard , you weren 't much funnier in school , either . - Oh , right- - So you are bopping ' the beast . - You know , why don 't you shut up , romek , or maybe you 'd like me to shut you up ! - You want a piece of me , haldane ! - Yeah ! - Hey , Hey , Hey , Hey , hey ! Back off- - Back off ! Come on- - Come on ! - It was just a joke , lieutenant . - Yeah , sit down . - Officer took , Officer castle , I checked out your missing person with the hall of records , interplanetary and immigration . As far as I can determine , Mr. Skiles does not exist . - Well , he looks pretty real to me . We should go and see the other guy in the picture . Randall Butler . - This is a hell of a surprise , mrs . Newton ! I 've got movers scheduled ! - I 'm sorry , Mr. Borden . I 've changed my mind- - I have that right . - of course , you do ! But , with all the crime around here , wouldn 't you be better off in a new building ? - I like it here- - I know people . - Most of your neighbors have moved there , already ! - And that should be an incentive ? - Well , the offer isn 't gonna be there forever . Think about it . I 'll be back later . - You 'll be wasting your time . I never change my mind ! - I could live somewhere like this . - On your own ? - I didn 't say that . - Well , we should get a visual on Butler 's place , any second now . Ah , there we are . - What 's going on down there ? Tooky ! - You have entered restricted Military air space . Change your heading to 0-9-6 , and exit This fly zone . - the nerve . - This is officers castle and took . D.C.P.D. 88th precinct , on official police business . Request permission to proceed . - I repeat , change your heading and exit This fly zone . Failure to do so will result in the immediate use of force . - What the military chooses to do is , quite frankly , none of our business ! I want to know what you two were doing out there , in the countryside , on a low priority missing persons case . - But , sir , we thought it odd that a guy who clearly existed , had no history of ever being on altor . - I imagine you officers are familiar with illegal aliens . Now , how many of them do you suppose go around advertising the fact , huh ? - We 've got no reason to believe the guy 's an illegal . We talked with his fiancé . - Why do I get the idea that every officer in my staff is out there doing social work ? - Don 't you think there might be a connection , sir ? - What connection ? - Between what 's happening at Butler 's farm and the disappearance of Skiles ! - Oh , for heaven 's sake ! You have no hard evidence of a crime ! Leave it to missing persons , all right ? - Are you expecting company , Bertha ? - No . - You would like me to open the door ? - No ! - You must remind me to monitor your caffeine intake . You 're getting a little overwrought . - Whoa-Whoa- - Easy , Bertha ! You could hurt somebody with that thing . - that 's the idea . Well , don 't just stand there- - Come on in . - I just came by to see how you were doing . - Damn cops ... they 're everywhere ! What if he gets in the way ? - We 've just gotta let things take their course , and keep an eye on our boy . - Oh , it 's you , again . - Hello , there , mrs . Newton . Have you reconsidered , yet ? - I 'm not interested- - This is my home ! - I 'm sorry to hear that . You see , you leave me no choice . I have to persuade you . - Oh , no ! Get out of my home ! - Come on , old lady . - Get off me ! Get out ! - You can 't let this continue . The only way to find out who this Peter character is , is to ask her . - to be honest , I think I 'm afraid of what the answer would be . - Let an old gal give you a bit of advice . If you wanna be happy , you have to face your fears . - Please , let me go ! - You know , the views here are great . - Not just great- - They 're spectacular ! - I 'll move , I 'll move ! - You know , she 's a lucky lady , living in a place with a view like this . You take care , now . - aaaah ! - I brought her her dinner every day . She always complained ... But she always ate it . - Mrs. Fluss , I just heard . I 'm so sorry . Suicide 's a hell of a thing . - never ! Not in a month of blue moons ! - It 's always so-So unexpected . - I think what she 's saying is that there 's no way mrs . Newton would 've killed herself . - What are you talking about , Officer ? - I 'm talking about the fact that we feel there 's a connection between this incident , and the systematic harassment of tenants in your building . - Frankly , I 'm shocked , that you should make such a suggestion , at a time like this ! I came here to offer my condolences to mrs . Fluss ! - Thanks very much for your help , Mr. Borden . We 'll let you know if we need anything . - All right- - Okay . - Why didn 't you arrest him ! - It 's not that easy . - What 'd you find out on the background check ? - Borden 's strictly legit . Bought the building , outright , last month . Certified credit package , 26-Hour electronic escrow . The usual . - I 'll tell ya something . If he 's clean , I 'm a valerian glue dog . - Yeah , well , listen to this . He filed a demolition permit with city hall , but he 's not planning on building anything in its place . - Hey , lieutenant , we found this in the victim 's hand . - I 've seen that before ! Those thugs that attacked me , one of them was wearing a jacket with a button just like that . They murdered her ! They killed my best friend ! - Bertha , um , you said they came back ? - They sure did ! - Look , if we try a memory fit , do you think you could remember their faces this time ? - Every nasty detail ! - Come on , you- - move it . - Hey ! - All right , guys ! - Nailed ' em at the shuttle gate , interplanetary , tickets in hand . - Two minutes later , and they 'd have been nothing more than a memory fit . - Throw ' em in the cage- - Fatten them up . - Hey , watch it ! - Brogan and haldane are on their way down , right now . Very hungry . - I guess this means you get home in time for your mommy 's curfew . - Very funny . Let 's not scare ' em too quickly . - All right , then , I 'll lose the cattle prod , and we 'll start with the thumb screws . - Sounds good . - What gives ? - Where are they- - Interrogation ? - They 're , uh , they 're gone , lieutenant . - What ? - Yeah . A couple military types just walked right in and took ' em . - Hey , you , hold it right there ! - Lieutenant Brogan , Officer haldane . If you have any questions , see your captain . - Who the hell are you ? - Captain Weldon , m.I.A. - What does military intelligence want with these two ? - forget it , lieutenant . This is no longer your problem . - Since when is murder , in our precinct , not our problem ? - Since now . As far as you 're concerned , these two were never arrested , and this never happened . Talk to your captain , if you want . - I 'll do that . This isn 't over . - It 's over , Brogan ! - What ? We catch the criminals and you let ' em go ! - I didn 't let them go . I handed them over to the military ! - Just tell me why ! - I don 't like this anymore than you do ! Twice already , they 've interfered with my command ! But , as long as they don 't actually break the law , we have to stand clear . Hell , even if they do , we have to stand clear ! - Yeah , how far back is clear ? - All the way . There 's nothing I can do- - I 'm sorry , gentlemen ! - Hey , Jane . What was the story yesterday on that military plane ? - Well , you tell us . We 're flying along , minding our own business- - - Which was what ? - Well , we wanted to talk to a farmer , in connection with a missing persons case . - his name 's enro Skiles- - He 's the guy on the right . - Wait a minute , the guy on the left , that 's Borden , the landlord . - Borden- - his name 's Butler . - Yeah , he 's the farmer . - Yeah , they 're both the same . You know what , we 're workin on the same case here . This is definitely not over yet . - Psychopath . He 's torching ' the place- - Can you believe this ? - Huh , I can believe anything . It 's as good a way , as any , to get the building down . - What about the old lady ? - She 's still up there in her apartment . - Collateral damage . There 's a lot at stake here , Weldon . We can 't interfere with Butler . He 's all we 've got . Oh , no- - looks who 's here . - Get back in your cruiser , fellas . - Not a chance . We 're on legitimate police business here . - Put them back in their cruiser ! If they refuse to leave , shoot ' em ! - Don 't try it , pal . We 're checkin ' on a private citizen , then we 're outta here . - Too late for that , I 'm afraid . - Too late for what ? - Go home , officers . You don 't need to know anymore . - the hell , I don 't . - No , let him go . It won 't make any difference . - Bertha ! Bertha ! - Haven 't you heard of a door com , Jack ? - Come on- - We gotta go . - What 's happening ? - I don 't know- - We gotta go ! Come on ! - My robot , Rocky ! - There 's no time- - Let 's go ! Come on , let 's take the stairs . - Haldane . What are you doin ' in there ? Answer me ! - Stay back , Bertha ! - Haldane ! Get your Butt outta there- - We got a major fire down here ! - Yeah , right- - Tell me about it . It might help if you put it out . Okay , I 'm gonna put you on my shoulder , all right ? Let 's go- - One , two , three . - oh ! - No ! - Aaah ! - Give me your hand , Brogan . - I lost my robot- - Rocky ! - Come on- - Come on ! - Come on ! - That was my home . - It 's all right , Bertha . Home is where the heart is- - You 'll find another one . - Damn you ! Butler 's dead- - You just had to interfere ! - I tried to save him , but- - - We saw what happened . - You were watching . You were watching from the beginning . Who was Butler ? Or , was it Borden ? What was he ? - You don 't wanna know . - humor me , Weldon ! Is there something under the building ? Something he wanted ? - That 's classified . It 's all classified . - Oh , great ! So , you just stand back and watch innocent people die , and nobody ever knows ! - Lieutenant , if a few citizens have to die- - Ten , 100 , hell , even 1,000 , and we save the lives of a billion others , we have to stop it . - Well , if it 's that bad , then people have the right to know what it is ! You don 't know , do you ? You don 't , either . - Why him ? - Hey , orrin ... good news , Buddy . I found a place for you to live . My neighbor 's movin ' out . - Uh , I don 't need a place . I live with my mom . - Well , what about your quest for freedom ? Your-Your life without curfews ? - But , what would my mom do without me ? I mean , who would clean the compactor ? - What your dad 's for , orrin . - Right . Hey , uh , haldane , uh , what I wanted to say was , uh- - I mean , uh , maybe I was a little bit out of line about you and mrs . Fluss . - Mmm , you know , that 's funny . Bertha told me that she meant everything she said about you . - Huh ? Hey ! - How 's Peter ? - He 's fine . - Mmm-Mmm . - Um ... we ought to clear this up . - Look , um ... I just want you to know , if there 's somebody you 're really interested in , I understand . And I want you to know that , I only give you a hard time because ... Well , because I , you know , I care about you . - I care about you , too . Really . - So , who 's Peter ? - He 's my brother . - Your brother . Your brother ? - Yes . - Sorry to break this up--Haldane . Podly won 't budge . - What- - you mean , on the Butler case ? - The arson squad says the fire was accidental , the coroner says Butler was burned too badly to autopsy , and the media seems to have slept through the whole damned thing ! - It 's like they said , " it never happened . " - M.I.A. Headquarters , how may I help you ? - Yeah , it 's lieutenant Brogan , D.C.P.D. Let me speak to captain Weldon . - one moment , please . I 'm sorry- - There is no captain Weldon in this command . - Well , maybe you can tell me how I can contact her . - Negative- - I have no record of any captain Weldon , in any department . Are you sure you have the right name ? - No , I 'm not sure- - I 'm not sure about anything . Thanks for your help . You believe in ghosts ? - Well , you destroyed Randall Butler . But we still don 't know what it is . - I 'm a lot more worried about the big one . Commander , we 'll be transporting within the hour . - Very good , major . You 're show . - Uh , put down there , the first warehouse . - Yes , sir . - Just those two on the door ? - Low profile , captain . - too low I 'd say . - need to know priority . Only the four who dig up the thing know we have it here . Seal off each end of the block till we 're outta here . - We oughta destroy that thing right now . - Command has to know what makes it tick first . That 's what " site r " is for . Then I 'll breathe easier once we get it there . - can you tell me where it is yet ? - All in good time . Ah , here is your key . Only two exist . - ahhh ! - I 've never seen it flair like that before . Well , I 'll be damned . - What ? - It 's vibrating . I hope it isn 't getting ready to do its thing . - don 't even joke . - No joke . The mystery is why it hasn 't already . - get away , major . - Ha-Ha , where to , captain ? If This is it , ground zero 's the best seat in the house . Ahhh ! - Major , are you all right ? Graffa , take it easy . - What are you doing ? - It needs this . - stop it , graffa . [ grunting ] - Stop her . Stook , get her . Oh . I will get it for you . I will get it . I will ... - Okay , I 'm outta here . - I love you . - Love you . - Ah , wait up , dad . I 'll walk you to the door . You know it 's your anniversary today . - Yeah , I know . - You not gonna do the same thing as last year are you , dad ? - You want us to make you a reservation at a really nice restaurant . - What did you get her ? - Relax , you guys . - This is the big one , dad , 15 years . - Really ? - Dad . - Gotta go- - Bye . See ya . - Stay calm . - Yeah , you too . - Let 's take a ride . Over to the Van . Open the door , lieutenant . - What was that- - a Sleeper ? - I 'll tell you in a minute . - Tell me now ! - Don 't let me have to shoot you before you know what 's going on . Okay ? - Okay . So , what 's the story , Weldon ? - Captain Weldon . Major graffa may have tagged me k.O.S. But I 'm still a loyal servant Officer . - Kill on sight ? Oh , you 're great company , captain . - Here 's your story . This is naja , a planet on the far side of the Ripley galaxy just two unit months ago . And these pictures are taken live from the planet 's last operational satellite . It 's a dead world now . - What happened ? - The red areas are eruptions from a space-Borne parasite . At first , everyone thought they were meteors , But they started spreading like a fungus , killing all organic life . - is , ah , that one of ' em ? - Uh-Uh , we don 't know what that is . Randall Butler had it , and he lead us to one of the places where the parasite did land . - under the old rodham towers building . - Major graffa 's got it now , and he 's taken it to a secret location . We gotta find it and destroy it . It if bursts , it will spew millions more , or we be too late . - We ? - I need your help . - Ah . - You know so much already . I 'm alone , lieutenant . You 're the only choice I got . - I can 't help you . - You want to know what 's in the hypo ? T.Z.8. It 's a lethal enzyme . It 'll unzip every Strand of d.N.A. In your body . - You 're crazy . - hold on , I can stop it . There 's an antidote . It works a lot faster on plants then on people . You got about 52 hours before it kicks in . - You 're sick . - I need motivated assistance from you , lieutenant . So we better get busy . - Hey , Liz , where 's your daddy- - He 's kind of late . - He 's probably out panic buying an anniversary present for my mom . - Yeah , right- - That 's today , isn 't it ? - How soon they forget , even the good ones . - Ah , thanks , Liz- - Take care . - See ya . - Yeah , wait , I wouldn 't forget . Come on- - I remembered Brogan 's . - True , but then you have a mind made for minutiae . - Come on , give me a break here . All right , your favorite dish is altorian pasta . You 're favorite color is sapphire . You love creaon renaissance poetry . You love the STAR drive ride at astroland , and night walks on glow beaches . - Very good . Okay , it 's my turn . Ah , you like ton wine with seafood . Um , you 're loyal to the fault , but can 't accept compliments . Um , you have a cute behind , and you scoff when you 're pleased like you 're doing now . - So what are we saying here , castle ? - I don 't know- - that we 're both observant ? Hey , do you want to go out this weekend ? - for fun ? - No , for real . - Attention , please , this is a scrambled government transmission . - What the- - - Please enter your personal code to unscramble this communication . - Who the hell are you ? - Commander general , military intelligence . - What do you want ? - We have a situation with one of our agent officers in your area . You need to be briefed . - Carson , we need a qualitative analysis on this thing right away . - What is it ? - We were hoping you would tell us . - Ah , this is captain Weldon , m.I.A. - Didn 't know you hung with the type , lieutenant . - Neither did I. - Captain Weldon , you 're under arrest by order of your commander general . - over here , Weldon . - Captain . - You 'll report to me in the briefing room , lieutenant . - Yeah , captain , I got a problem here . She dosed me . - What ? - What did you hit him with ? - T.Z.8- - Antipersonal enzyme . - Oh , no . - Relax , Brogan , you were tryin and that was our deal . Here , this will deactivate it . It 's the antidote . - Get her into a cell . - Thanks , captain . - Let me see that . T.Z.8. Will take you apart cell by cell . It 's clean . Drink it- - now . - Oh , tastes like slomo 's coffee . - I know as much as I 've been told . The m.I.A 's chief of staff is on his way up to handle it . I 'm meetin ' him in the briefing room . - How did they know Weldon was here ? - Well , they must have tracked her vehicle . - Yeah , but captain , if this big one they dug up could take out the whole planet- - - That 's her story , haldane . It could be a fabrication . Remember , we 're city police , and we 're not equipped or trained to handle this . Yeah , well neither is the m.I.A. By the looks of it . - Wrong again , lieutenant . - Keep reading it , tooki . - Sure . - if I get a little weird , give a yell . - Okay . - ahhh ! - Hey , I 'm reading something here . It 's alive . - What about the planet naja . Weldon showed me the film . - War , a senseless , terrible war . It was Weldon 's last assignment . - Yeah , I heard about it on interplanetary . - Yeah , it 's a tragedy . Now , captain , I 'll take custody of Weldon and the meteorite . - I 'll have them brought up . - Uh , let me do it . I , uh , I feel bad for her . - more coffee , major ? - Brogan , this thing 's an extra galactic spore . - Meaning ? - It 's like pollen . The one that Weldon 's after is probably the female , the seed , and you sure as hell don 't want this one near it . - that 's what Butler was trying to do , bring them together . - Probably . - a lot of pollens hitch rides on other life forms , in this case , us . - No wonder Everybody 's so scared . - Thanks , Carson , graffa is gonna be one very relieved soldier . - What 's up ? - He lied about this thing . - So ? Standard procedure in civil emergency , cover up . - Nah , it 's more than that . - I don 't follow . - Weldon had the spore , graffa 's got the seed , and one of them is trying to finish the job . - Which one- - He 's a liar . She 's a loose Cannon- - How do you trust either ? - I don 't . - Captain podly , it 's taking too long . - Haldane , see to it . - Yes , sir . - We 'll both see to it . - Let 's go . - Where ? - I 'm gettin ' you out of here . - You believe me . - I 'm workin ' on it . - Lieutenant , the captain just called . You 're to wait here for haldane . - Yeah , don 't worry about it- - she 's my responsibility . - Yes , sir , but you can 't take her away . - You lay a hand on another officer , and I 'm gonna drop you . - She 's gone ! - Code 11 , Officer down , prisoner at large- - Repeat , code 11 . - There they are . - What the hell you doing ? Stay out of this . - a.P.B. All units , suspects fleeing precinct 88 in an unmarked astrovan . One female human , Tara Weldon . One male human , Patrick Brogan , D.C.P.D. Approach these fugitives with caution . - welcome to the club . - You are gonna get straight with me starting now . - I 've been straight with you since I first brought you here . - Yeah , at the point of a gun and a hypo . - Point taken . Tactical mistake . I 'm sorry . - Yeah . - What 'll it take for you to trust me , Brogan ? - Oh , hell , I probably already do . - You do ? - Yeah , you kept your word even if you are m.I.A. - Thanks- - I guess . - don 't mention it . - I sure picked the right cop though , didn 't I ? So- - What now ? - We gotta destroy that thing . - I don 't know how . We could accidentally release it . - Then we gotta get it off altor . - Graffa 's got every high space Lane monitored . We poke our heads above orbit , we 're dead . - then we 've got no choice . We 've got to find the seed and take it out . - right . - What ? - I 'm sorry , Brogan , I don 't have much to lose really . But you 've got a family . - Well , ah , I won 't have if we don 't win . Do you have a secure comm line ? Random frequency unit , talk fast , though , graffa 's got a scanner . - Hi . - Sal . - What 's wrong ? - I can 't come home for a while , and , ah , you 're gonna hear some things about me . - Brogan , what 's happening ? - I can 't say over the comm . Now listen to me closely , I wanna celebrate our anniversary as usual . You got it ? - Yeah , I got it . Are you all right- - What 's-What 's- - - I gotta go , honey- - I love you . - I love you . - What 's your best guess where graffa would 've hid that thing ? - He prepared sight all himself . The only other person who knows is our commander general . - So , you 're his partner , think like he thinks . Where would he have put it ? - Damn , seeker- - Get in quick . - They 're coming up- - Get on their tail . Fire . - Where are the cannons on this thing ? - No where . The vehicle 's hardened , but you better lose ' em a.S.A.P. - I 'm doing my best . Hang on . - I can 't see , sir . - Damn . - Next time I shoot back . - Okay , I 'll be back in an hour or so . - if not , we 'll have to assume it 's time to go . - right . - All vehicles , I 'm calling a 24-Hour alert . Lieutenant Brogan is still at large . He must be found . - Hey . - You shouldn 't have risked it . - Where the kids ? - Out . Podly told me you helped a prisoner escape . - Yeah , I did . Honey , I want you to take the kids and get away from altor . - Why ? What 's this all about ? I mean , podly told me about the m.I.A. He also told me that- - That you might not be yourself . - there 's nothing wrong with me . - Ah , so I see . - stop it . - Look , listen , what if you 're under control , and you don 't even know it ? - I think I should go . - hold on , Brogan . - What 's this ? - Just hang a minute , will ya ? - They asked for you- - they 're your friends . - Yeah , we ain 't here to arrest you or nothin ' . - Nah , just to find out what 's going on . - Okay , so what made you think I 'd be nuts enough to come back to my own home ? - It 's the last thing Anybody would expect . The usual . You and Sal , you spend every anniversary cuddled up , makin ' out , watchin ' a movie because that 's what you did on your first anniversary- because it 's all we could afford- - Yeah . So , am I me or not ? - You win on consistency . - So what 's the plan , lieutenant ? - Team six-O reporting . Nothing doing in the siouxrob district . - Copy , tooki- - Clear to zone five . Report back in 20 . - Ah , forget her . I have what I need . Be on your guard . - sir . - You 're dismissed . Get your things and leave immediately . - Yes , sir , but- - - Get outta of here . - Look at that . - Ooh ! - Ahhh ! - There 's somethin wrong here . - I make one shooter over behind the pipes . - ahhh ! - What is wrong with you ? - Ohh ! - Just great . Now how are you supposed to trust her ? - I thought he 'd been caught by you , hot shot . You notice I wasn 't shooting ' at him ? - We have to assume that , ah , graffa 's got the spore to the seed . How long before it blooms ? - On naja , the cycle started to repeat itself every 19 hours . - that 's wonderful , and we don 't have any idea where the damn thing is . - Castle . - sir . - Officers haldane , romek and orrin are failing to report . Would you have any ideas or information on that , castle ? - Me , sir ? - Yes , you , sir . - he ... they 've likely gone to hook up with Brogan , sir . - Add their names to the dragnet . - captain , they wouldn 't turn on us . - They may have or they may be hostages or worse . In any event , we need to know . Don 't we , Officer ? Get to it . - Morning . Did he come out of there last night ? - Ha , I 'd sure like to know what he 's been doing ? - Hey . What 's that ? It 's glowing . - Hey , what happened to that bush ? Jeez , it 's everywhere . - Securely attached to their person at all times . - Brogan . - And now an unusual item from the toymen province . Farmers in the tri-Valley are concerned about a mysterious disease that has struck overnight , destroying a number of crops . Prices may be affected . And now for the weather . - It 's started . - Damn , works fast . - The roots spread underground killing ' the soil- - 19 hours later it bursts , sending out millions more . It 's over . - No , not yet . We know how to find the thing now . - We 'll cover ya . Stay low until you get to the tri-Valley , then , ah , pop up to altitude and scan the ground for heat . - Ha , it 's another kind of heat I 'm worried about . - Captain , what are we lookin ' for exactly ? - The dead plant Life is starting to rot emitting heat , infrared will give us an exact picture of the affected area . - right- - The center will be where graffa 's got the seed . - You got it . - Airspace intrusion right on top of us . Scramble the cruiser . - Yes , sir . - hold it right here . - I 'm slowing down , captain . - Looks good . Got it . We 're directly above the epicenter . - Right- - Check the land register- - See who owns it . - Yeah , it 's coming up now . Ah , oh , man , you 'll love this . - Randall Butler ? Graffa hits side arm on Butler 's farm- - Oh , perfect . - What the- - Where the hell did he come from ? - Masking himself as m.I.A. - You want him ? You got him . Slots trim for maneuver . Trap 's open , both cannons hot . - Now ! Like I said , next time I shoot back . - How do we begin to hunt down Brogan and haldane ? What if we do nail them ? What 'll we do with them ? Honestly . - Honestly ? We arrest them . - right . - What happened ? - They shot down the cruiser . - Keep your eyes peeled- - We may get action . - Okay . Scanning for movement . Four bodies , two at ten , two at thirty . - go . - go . - Orrin , romek , you in position ? - We 're all set here- - what ! - They made us- - Fall back . - I thought you 'd never ask . - Cover me . - ahh ! - Brogan ! - Ahhh ! - Give him a hand . - damn ! - What the- - - Captain podly , commander . You busted in on me like this yesterday , remember ? - How did you get this code ? - Ah , police sources . I have a pal who has a friend who 's c.I.A. Etc . - What 's on your mind ? - Major graffa 's on my mind . My very best people have broken ranks to help Weldon . Now doesn 't that bother you ? It sure has hell bothers me . - Everything bothers me . Thank you for your concern , captain . - Yes , commander . - Scramble the scorpion bomber to " Site R. " Time is the enemy now . They have to kill them all . Let history sort ' em out . - Beautiful , isn 't it ? Terrible , but beautiful . - kill it . - don 't know how . Besides , it 's about to burst . - Wanna bet ? - Ha-Ha , hey , you 'll only be helping it , spreading it everywhere . You see , it 's like a fungus , Brogan , a very simple life form . - Yeah , well maybe we can take it apart , cell-By-Cell . - Come on , keep moving . - Hey , Weldon , you got that enzyme you dosed me with ? - The enzyme ? - the T.Z.8. Come on , this thing 's ready to pop . - Graffa ! Just look at you . - Let me have it . If this stuff will take a human apart in 52 hours , it oughta go like wild fire through that thing . - It 'll fry you before you get close enough . - Well , I 'll just have to take that chance . - No , let me be your shield . I 'm dead already . It 's finished with me , but I 'm still a soldier . - I can 't let you do that . - Let him or I will . - Come on , lieutenant , it 's your last shot . [ groaning ] - Here comes the cavalry . - Let 's go- - Move it- - Come on . - Right on time . - D.C.P.D. Hold it where you are . On the ground , face down , everybody . - hold on , castle . - Drop you weapon , haldane . - I can 't do that . You don 't know what 's going on here . - You don 't know what 's going on . You 're under arrest- - Drop it now . Drop it , haldane , please . - Some date , huh ? - Yeah . - would it help if I told you I love you ? - I don 't know . - What about you ? - I love you , too , but- - - So , what do you say you two guys don 't shoot each other , huh ? - Yeah , take a life time to hassle it out . - Look , cut it out , guys . What is going on here anyway ? - Command , this is scorpion gamma Dragon . We 're at optimum logistics . " Site R , " Target is acquired .

 - You in charge here ? - Kraskow . Is the Bureau takin ' over ? That 's not why I 'm here . - What can you tell me ? - Silent alarm tripped . We think there 's one robber , armed - a handgun . Definitely no pro , or he would have been long gone . Single gunshot 20 minutes ago . blinds are down , but we think we 've got a body on the floor . - But you 're not here to take over ? - Two of my agents might be in there . - Skinner ! Skinner ! - Hold it right there . - Do I know you ? - Stop this ! Don 't let this happen ! Stop this , Skinner ! You 're in charge here , you know ? It doesn 't have to end like this . - Yeah , it does . - No ! Son of a ... That 's nice . Hello ? It 's comin ' through down there ? It 's my damn waterbed . My damn waterbed sprung a leak . It 's my damn waterbed . My damn waterbed sprung a leak . I know I 'm not supposed to have a waterbed . I don 't know what to tell you . I think it was a gift . AII right . - I missed the meeting . - You didn 't miss it . You 're extraordinarily late for it . It 's still going on . - What are you doin ' here ? - I came looking for you . - What are you doing here ? - Havin ' the best day of my Iife . Any moment , I 'm about to burst into song . Zippity doo-dah . My waterbed sprung a leak and shorted out my alarm clock . My cellphone got wet and crapped out on me . And the check I wrote to cover the damages will bounce if I don 't deposit my pay . - You ever have one of those days ? - Since I 've been working here ? Yeah . When did you get a waterbed , Mulder ? The bank 's just down the street . I 'II be back in ten . Cover for me , will ya ? When do I not ? - Jerk ! - Yeah ? You want some ? We good ? - Pam ? - Go run your errand already . Yeah . I just gotta go pick somethin ' up . No biggie . Right , Bernard . No biggie . I 'II be ten minutes . Wait here for me . - You need to watch it ! - You watch it ! Right on schedule . Poor guy . You never did that before . - Yes , we 'II give you credit . - OK . Thank you . .. and that 's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year . Other DOJ projections ... estimate a larger - two to three per cent - drop in the overall homicide rate , versus the one to one-and-a-half per cent cited in the earlier Tanner study . However , there is some dispute that the statistical methodology in this latter study that the statistical methodology in this latter study is not the DOJ-preferred methodology . In any case , added variables make crime trends for the coming year particularly hard to predict . The unpredictable future . Which brings us to Agent Mulder . Will he or will he not grace us with his report ? May I help the next in line , please ? I 've got three transactions . Customers , face down ! You know what this is ! - Oh , God ! - You ! On the floor ! - Oh , God , don 't shoot us ! - Shut up ! You 're the boss . It 's all right . AII right ! I 'm the boss ! No silent alarms , no dye packs ! Do like the insurance company taught ya . Quicker you go , quicker I go . Everybody else , out here on the floor . Leave the Iast one . No tricks . AII right , come on . Come on , come on , come on ! Zippity doo-dah . AII right , get your keys , come around here . We 're gonna open up the ATM . Lock the doors . You forgot to lock the front door . On the ground ! - Drop it ! Drop it now ! - You drop it ! You drop it ! Travel expense reimbursement - who 's got those figures ? AII I 've got here is third and fourth quarter . No ? Assistant Director ? Go , go , go . Go , go , go ! Sir ... - Who 's in charge here ? - I am . Unless the Bureau 's taking over . - Skinner ! - Hold it ! Skinner ! Don 't let them charge in there . - Skinner ? - Do I know you ? Skinner ! They 're supposed to call , right ? They 're not gonna call . - What 's your name ? - Yeah ! Look , I gotta call you something , right ? How about Steve ? That 's a nice , honest name . Steve . Bernard . Bernard . I have to get my partner out of here . I am blowing ' this whole freakin ' place right off the map if they come in here . Look , they don 't know that . Don 't you realize that ? They can 't see you ! They don 't know what your plan is . They 'd damn well better figure it out . Look , just walk in front of the door and show them . - You wanna get me killed ! - Oh , God ... - You wanna get me killed ! - Oh , God ... I just want everybody to live . That 's all . I just ... Just show them . You have control over everything that happens here . You do . And it doesn 't have to end this way . Yeah , it does . No ! Oh , son of a ... Son of a bitch . That 's great . Yeah ? It 's comin ' through down there ? It 's my damn waterbed . It sprung a leak . I know I 'm not supposed to have a waterbed . I don 't know what to tell ya . I 'm sorry . I mean , I ... - Who you callin ' ? - Nobody . Nobody ? It 's gotta be somebody . It 's nobody you know , Bernard . Forget it . There 's somethin ' I gotta do . I want you to come . I 'm not goin ' with you . Look , I 'm not asking . Pam ? Don 't go gettin ' all weird on me . It 'II only take a couple of minutes . Look , Bernard , just go to work . It 's not too late . I 'm not goin ' to work today . - Don 't say they 're gonna fire me . - I wasn 't gonna say that . Cos you know what ? Who cares ? Like there 's a big future in mopping ' floors ! Like that 's somethin ' to lose ! - We lose everything . - No , no . I got a plan . - This time tomorrow , Pam ... - Everything will be roses . Dammit . I missed the meeting . Well , not yet . But only because it 's the longest in FBI history . - What are you doin ' here , then ? - I came looking for you . We took a five-minute break three minutes ago . Mulder , your cellphone 's not working . Did you oversleep ? Did you ever have one of those days you want to rewind and start over again ? Yes , frequently . But , I mean , who 's to say that if you did rewind it and start over , it wouldn 't end up the same ? So you think it 's all fate ? We have no free will ? No , I think that we 're free to be the people that we are . Good , bad or indifferent . - I think our character determines our fate . - AII the rest is just preordained ? I don 't buy that . There 's too many variables . I meant to be on time to work today , but my waterbed springs a leak , flooding my apartment and the one below me . So that makes me late . Then I gotta write a check to cover the damages , but I realize that that 's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay . So now I gotta go to the bank , which makes me even later . Since when did you get a waterbed ? I might just as easily not have a waterbed , and then I 'd be on time . You might have stayed in medicine and not gone into the FBI , and then we would never have met . blah , blah , blah . - Fate . - With every choice , you change your fate . Then let 's change yours . I will deposit your check . You gather your files , go to Skinner , give your report - before he takes it out on both of us . Endorsed my damn check stub ! Mulder ! - Don 't go in the bank today . - Excuse me ? Bernard 's in there . please , don 't go in the bank . - Do I know you ? - You pass me every day on the street . Every single day . This day . On your way to the bank . You go inside and everybody gets killed - you , your partner , Bernard . Everybody . - I pass you , and then we 're dead . - Yes . Over and over . Only , last time , you looked at me like you knew me . Like you remembered . please remember me . Don 't go . Drop your weapon ! - Drop it ! - I ain 't dropping ' nothin ' . You put yours down . - I 'II shoot her ! - What do you think I 'II do then ? Bernard ? That 's your name , right ? That 's your name , right ? Bernard , she 's not dead . You 're not a murderer yet . You can end this the right way . Sir , please ... listen to them . Don 't hurt anybody else . A whole lot of police are comin ' . You tripped the alarm . No ! Yeah , I know . Yeah , I know . I know already . I 'II pay for it . The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not ... - Agent Scully . - Yes ? - please . Don 't go inside the bank today . - The bank ? Cradock Marine , 8th Street branch , a block from here . I 'm not following . Did you get separated from your tour ? I 'm here to see you . I 'm begging you , please don 't go this time . Don 't let Mulder go either . - I 'm sorry ... - Excuse me , miss . You 're not supposed to be in this area . If you walk in that bank , you 'II die . Both of you . I missed the meeting ? No . No , we took a five-minute break about three minutes ago . Mulder , your cellphone 's not working . - Wow . That is so strange . - What ? I just got the sensation of deja vu . I 've been havin ' it all morning . - It 's fairly common . - Never to this degree . I mean , I woke up , I opened my eyes , I was soaking wet . It 's a Iong story , but I had the distinct sensation that I had lived that moment before . Well , you may have . Did you do a Iot of drinking in college ? - What does it mean ? - Why does it have to mean anything ? Some Freudians believe the deja vu phenomenon to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious that represents a desire to have a second chance , to set things right . - Set what kind of things right ? - Whatever 's wrong . It 's more likely that we 're talking about neurochemistry . A glitch in the brain 's ability to process recognition and memory . - It doesn 't mean the memory 's authentic . - Yeah , but what if it were ? What if you 'd lived this moment before , and are living it again ? Yeah . So that I could right some wrong , or change fate . Right now I 'd say you 're fated to go to this meeting . No , actually , I 'm fated to go to the bank . Mulder ? What bank ? - Cradock , right down the street . - 8th Street . What ? Some woman stopped me in the hallway ten minutes ago . She knew both our names . She warned against either of us entering into the Cradock branch on 8th Street . She warned against either of us entering into the Cradock branch on 8th Street . She said that we 'd die . What did she look like ? Five-eight , thin , green eyes , dyed hair . Maybe you know her . Maybe it 's just somebody pulling a prank . I 'II use the ATM machine . I don 't wanna tempt fate . Next is federal crime projections . Who 's got the figures ? Right here . If you 'II all just bear with me one second . Federal crime projections ... - Do you remember me ? - You match the description . You 're the woman that gave a warning to my partner , aren 't you ? - Have we met ? - More times than I can count . Right here on this sidewalk . Usually you walk right by . You 'II pass a few minutes earlier , a few minutes later . Little details , they change . - But it always ends the same . - What always ends the same ? We keep having this conversation . We go inside the bank and we all die . That 's what you told my partner . Is something going to happen inside the bank ? Is there gonna be a robbery ? Every time I tell you there will be a robbery , you run in there to stop it , Every time I tell you there will be a robbery , you run in there to stop it , and that 's when things go bad . Don 't you see ? We 're all in Hell . I 'm the only one who knows it . Something went very wrong on this day the first time around . Something got screwed up . Things didn 't end the way they were supposed to . And now it 's like a needle stuck in a groove . You 're saying this day repeats over and over again ? Until we get it right . Till my boyfriend doesn 't blow up that bank . I have tried everything to stop him . I 've hid his keys . I 've drugged his coffee . I even called the police on it myself . He always gets here . He 's meant to . It 's you . It 's you and your partner every time . If it wasn 't for you , nobody would die . If it 's true , how come I don 't remember ? How come you 're the only one ? - That 's 50 times you 've asked me that . - What 's the answer ? I don 't know . I just do . Be glad you don 't . please , you can stop this . You 're the variable . It has to be you . I have tried everyone else . AII I 'm asking is you just walk away . .. that 's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year . Other DOJ projections estimate a larger - two to three per cent - drop in the overall homicide rate , versus the one to one-and-a-half per cent cited in the earlier Tanner study . - However , there 's some dispute that ... - Excuse me , Agent Arnold . - Where 's Scully ? - She just left . I sent her to look for you . Excuse me . Everybody , face down ! You know what this is ! Give me the money ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! You ! On the floor ! Oh , God ! You 're gonna shoot us ? God ! He 's gonna ... - Shut up ! - He 's gonna shoot us ! please don 't kill us ! - please don 't do this ! please don 't ! - Shut up ! Give me the money ! - Don 't shoot us ! Don 't shoot us ! - Dammit ! Shut up ! Get your hands up where I can see ' em ! Do it ! Do it now ! Drop your weapon ! He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . I know , I know . I missed the meeting . You didn 't miss it . You 're extraordinarily late for it . Bank 's down the street . Cover for me , will ya ? We good , Pam ? - Pam ? - I know . You just gotta go pick somethin ' up . No biggie . What is with you ? Why are you always in a mood ? What is with you ? Why are you always in a mood ? Cos nothing ever changes . Things are gonna change . You wait and see . I 'II be ten minutes . Wait here for me . - You need to watch it ! - You watch it ! - Do I know you ? - Do you ? - Yeah , you just look really familiar to me . - Do I ? Yeah . No ? AII right , I 'm sorry to bother you . May I help the next in line , please ? He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb .

In any case , added variables make crime trends for the coming year ... Excuse me . Agent Scully ? Excuse me . It 's Agent Mulder . He said it 's urgent . - Mulder , where are you ? - I 'm at the bank . Yeah , I know where you are . What 's taking so long ? Scully , I need you to do something for me right now . - Ma 'am , will you come with me ? - Why ? - Just come with me , please . - What 's this about ? My partner said you 'd know . Take it . I 'm a federal agent . I don 't want us all to die in here . - What are you talking about ? - You 've got a girlfriend outside in the car . And you 've got a bomb . Something very bad is gonna happen here today . And I want you to know that I 'm not gonna let it happen . But if you walk out that door right now , I 'm not gonna stop you . - You 're in charge here , Bernard . - You 're damn right . You can change your fate . Everybody down ! You know what this is ! - No ! Oh , God ! - Get down ! If you don 't believe me , ask her . - Drop it ! - Get away from her , Pam . This isn 't gonna work ! - Drop it now ! - You drop it . - Listen to me . - Get her outta here ! You 're dooming her . You 're making her live this day over and over . Her , you , me , all of us ! What are you talkin ' about ? Every day , you die in here . And every day , it starts all over again . - You can 't want this for her ! It 's hell ! - Hell ? I 'm doing this for her . Listen to him , Bernard . Put your damn gun down ! Put your gun down , Scully . It 's the only way . You gotta put your gun down and let them out . He 's got a bomb . Come on , Bernard . Let 's go . - You son of a bitch ! - No ! This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI ... This never happened before . - Yeah . - Mulder , it 's me . - I 'm late again , aren 't I , Scully ? - No , not yet . But Skinner wants to see us as soon as possible . He 's asking for our report on the robbery yesterday . I 'II be there in an hour . - I 'd Iike to hear it , too . - Well , you were there , Scully . That 's not what I mean . You still won 't explain what happened . How you knew that Bernard Oates was strapped with explosives . Call it a feeling . And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice waiting in the car ? I don 't think she was an accomplice . I think she was just tryin ' to get away . - Are you OK ? - I 'II be there in an hour .

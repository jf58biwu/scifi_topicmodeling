 I 'm here in Pasadena with the NASA Mission Control team as they celebrate scientific history . The first close-up photographs of Mars from the Viking Observer spacecraft . Photos that have created a stir by revealing surprising geologic information . The presence of large amounts of water locked in Mars ' polar ice caps . Water that some speculate could have possibly sustained life on the planet . Even more controversial is one image of a land formation . A formation that looks like a sculpted human face . However , NASA officials are denying it is an indication of an alien civilisation . It 's no more than a trick of light and shadows . A geologic anomaly . The only sculptors at work are the solar winds that blow across the surface of Mars at 300mph , ten months a year . I 'm seeing ... I 've got ... How 's it going out there ? - There 's something out here ! - Can you repeat that , Commander Belt ? It 's coming at me ! Holy God ! Pickup terminal sequence . Booster hydraulic power units on . This is Shuttle Launch Control . T minus one minute , 15 seconds . - OTC to CDR , how do you read ? - Loud and clear , OVCC . - Go ahead . - Roger that . OVCC verified . - Port setup , 2.0 . - Copy setup . 2.0 . CDR Houston , how do you read ? Loud and clear . Side hatch closeout and white room configuration complete . Retracting orbiter arm . - OMS pressure on . Cabin vent complete . - Roger . We see that . All systems go for APU start . Transfer to internal power . Pre-start complete . APU to inhibit . Oxygen vent hood retracted . External tank is at flight pressure . Lock your visors and initiate your O2 flow . - Y 'all have a good trip . - Roger that . T minus 20 seconds and counting . Go for auto-sequence start . Booster hydraulic units have started . T minus 10 ... Nine ... Eight ... Seven ... Six ... Five ... Four ... Three ... Abort liftoff . Abort liftoff . System failure . Abort . Repeat . We have an abort liftoff at Tminus three seconds . What did the note say ? That they worked for NASA and wanted to talk to somebody from the fbi . - Why the cloak-and-dagger routine ? - l have no idea . - Think it 's a crank ? - lt 's beginning to look that way . - My name is Michelle Generoo . - Fox Mulder . I sent you the note . Hi . Special Agent Dana Scully . I 'm sorry to have to take these precautions . I flew up from Houston this morning . - l work at the Space Center there . - ln what capacity ? I 'm the Mission Control communications commander for the Shuttle Space Program . What brings you to Washington ? I have reason to believe a saboteur may be at work inside NASA . - You have evidence of sabotage ? - l don 't know. I may . Two weeks ago , a shuttle mission was scrubbed three seconds before liftoff when an auxiliary power unit valve malfunctioned . If the flight had not been aborted , the orbiter would have exploded on the launch pad . This was sent to me in the mail . It 's a material analysis that shows deep , grooved scoring marks inside this APU valve . Marks that could have caused a malfunction . - Evidence of tampering ? - That 's what it looks like but ... The person who gave me your names said you are experts in unexplained phenomena . It 's unexplainable how and when anybody could 've done it . - How do you mean ? - The valve is made of ferrocarbon titanium . To score it would take extreme temperatures . Launch pad temperatures . Anyone at NASA would say it would be impossible for anyone to do that type of damage undetected . - Any idea who may have sent that to you ? - No . No idea . But the official analysis of the malfunction was simple mechanical failure . - Does anybody share your suspicions ? - lf they do , they 're not talking to the fbi . I believe in the Space Program . I believe in the people who run it . But there 's another launch window tomorrow . And my reasons may sound selfish , but my fianc√© is the shuttle commander on that mission . Why would somebody sabotage the space shuttle ? If you 're a terrorist , it 's a potent symbol of American progress and prosperity . If you 're an opponent of big science , NASA represents a vast money trench that exists outside the crucible of the democratic process . Then there are futurists who think the shuttle is a rusty old bucket that we should mothball . A dinosaur spacecraft built in the ' 70s by scientists setting their sights on space . And we thought we 'd rest easy when the Soviet Union fell . Not to mention fringe elements who accuse our government itself of space sabotage . The failure of the Hubble telescope and the Mars Observer connected - to a conspiracy to deny us evidence . - Evidence of what ? Alien civilisations . Oh , of course ! - Wow , look at that ! Gemini Eight . - What ? The man we 're gonna see , Colonel Marcus Aurelius Belt , nearly died on that mission . Made an emergency landing in the Pacific Ocean . - You remember all that stuff ? - You never wanted to be an astronaut ? I guess I missed that phase . Come in . Colonel Belt , I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully . - And this is ... - Colonel Belt . Fox Mulder . I 'm a big fan. lt 's an honour to meet you . - You were a big hero to me when I was a kid . - Thank you . I ... I stayed up all night when I was 14 to watch your space walk . Well , now it 's like a stroll around the block . So , how can I help you ? This found its way to the fbi . Do you recognise it ? Sure. it 's an auxiliary power unit valve . Do you have any reason to believe it was damaged in an effort to sabotage the Space Program ? No . - Do you have reason to suspect it at all ? - No reason whatsoever . If you have any respect for this program and for those who have devoted their lives to it , you 'll be careful to whom you make those accusations . Looking at this evidence , sir , would you consider postponing the shuttle flight until a full investigation could be conducted ? I don 't know where you got this specious artefact , but every precaution has been taken to rectify the problem . We 've waited two weeks for a window to initiate this mission . We 've got a payload to deliver . Has an internal investigation been done in this matter ? The part you have here has been installed , inspected and designed by over 100 highly trained technicians . With the security measures we take , it would be virtually impossible for one man working by himself , or two or four men , to do what you 're suggesting . I can assure you , there 's no one in this facility that doesn 't want to see that shuttle complete its mission , and come back like Winged Victory herself . And in about ten hours , God willing , you 're gonna see just that . Do you think there 'd be a problem with us watching liftoff from Mission Control ? Well , being that you 'd probably go over my head anyway , please , be my guests . It was an honour , sir . Thank you . Didn 't you wanna get his autograph ? Where did you say you got this ? It came to us anonymously . This is an APU valve , all right . But this doesn 't make sense . - What doesn 't make sense ? - This scoring here . This valve was made of ferrocarbon titanium . - You didn 't order the analysis ? - No. I 've never seen this before . We 're on outside contract to NASA . They may have ordered it . But wouldn 't you order a material analysis if a part malfunctioned ? Every shuttle flies with that same APU valve . To do an analysis and redesign would delay the Program for months . Not to mention the cost . is it conceivable that the Program is being pushed ahead without proper safety precaution ? There are about 17,000 things that can go wrong with the shuttle . And about 17,000 people who make sure they don 't . Who makes the final determination as to its safety ? We make a recommendation but the decision is Colonel Belt 's . Thank you . What do you think ? I can 't believe how much faith we put in machines . Do you think Colonel Belt lied about his knowledge of a saboteur ? I can 't believe Colonel Belt would endanger the lives of those astronauts . He was an astronaut himself . So you think this X-ray is bogus ? God , I hope so . This is Shuttle Launch Control with Tminus one minute , 40 seconds and counting . - OVCC verified . - Roger that . OVCC verified . Here we go . T minus one minute , 30 and counting . - Final purge sequence . Main engine check . - Copy . Main engine check . Switching off ground supply . - On-board fuel cells check . - Roger , OTC . Pickup terminal sequence FPS . - OTC to CDR , how do you read ? - Loud and clear . Capacitor energy storage banks all at 241 . - OTC to CDR , how do you read ? - Loud and clear . CDR Houston , how do you read ? Loud and clear . Side hatch closeout and white room configuration complete . Retracting orbiter arm . - All systems go for APU start . - Go with APU start . BBSR power down and ready for launch . - Transfer to internal power . - Transfer to internal power . Gimballing of engines complete . Aero surfaces in launch position . MPDR assembled . Military recorder is running . OK . Copy . Oxygen vent hood retracted . External tank is at flight pressure . CDR , lock your visors and initiate your O2 flow . - Y 'all have a good one . - Roger that . Go for auto-sequence start . Booster hydraulic units have started . Go for main engine start . T minus 10 and counting . Nine ... Eight ... Seven ... Six ... Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One ... Zero ... Ignition . We have liftoff of the shuttle orbiter . CDR Houston , betcha y 'all have never seen a more beautiful sight . Roger that . Ten-four . I have to admit I 've fulfilled one of my boyhood fantasies . Yeah , it ranks up there with learning how to braid my own hair . Come on , Scully , you have to admit that was exciting . - Mission Control , the countdown ... - Mulder ! Wait ! - Something 's gone wrong . - What happened ? Something 's wrong with the shuttle . We had trouble with the rocket boosters , but fixed it . We changed watch. I went home to try to get some sleep . I got a call . Communication with the shuttle is down . We 've got to get back to Houston . There 's a press blackout . Chances are the media doesn 't know about it . - You think this is sabotage ? - l don 't know . Things go wrong all the time . - Yeah , but they usually fix them , right ? - Usually . She 's turning . Michelle ! - l can see her . - Michelle ! - Help ! - Are you all right ? - Oh , I 'm stuck ! - Can you move ? Just get me out of here ! I 'm wedged in ! - Are you all right ? - l 'm wedged in ! Come here . Can you push with your legs ? - Be careful . - Just get me out of here ! OK ! All right ! Come on . Don 't try to move . I 've got to get back to Houston . - What happened ? - l don 't know . Something came at me in the fog . The next thing I knew , I was upside down . - Was it some kind of an animal ? - No . It had a face. lt was ... lt was grotesque . I don 't know what it was . Orbiter , this is Houston . Do you copy ? Your transmission is breaking up . What 's happening ? We have a malf in the OMS and RCF systems . They can 't get the orbiter into attitude rotation . Temperature in the cabin is 103 and they have transmission problems . - What happened ? - l had an accident . What 's their position ? - Just over Eastern Africa . - Try the Seychelles tracking station . Hang in there , OTC . The orbiter manoeuvring system is down . They can 't rotate the shuttle to keep it away from the sun and keep the orbiter cool . Drop in cabin pressure . 21 kilopascals and declining . They 're gonna burn up . - Where 's Colonel Belt ? - On his way . - Damn ! What happened to backup ? - Failed to respond . What about telemetry ? Can we auto-activate from here ? We cannot auto-activate . It 's like someone 's interfering . - Screwing communications from this end . - Can you trace it ? - lt 'd have to be a digital processor . - They 'd have to be in the data banks . - Where 's that ? - Come on . Mulder ? I 'm a federal agent ! Come on out of there ! - What are you doing in here ? - l work here . - Let me see your clearance . - A sensor went off . There was a malfunction . - Did you find it ? - No . Did you see anybody else in here ? OK , call Security . I want a search of the premises . No one is to come in or out of this building without proper clearance . - l 'm breaking up , OTC . - What 's the attitude of the orbiter ? Flying tail first , belly towards the sun . The flash evaporator system is working but not enough to cool ' em down . - Cabin temperature 116 . - Where 's ... Somebody 's jamming our transmissions . interfering with our ground communications and scrambling our uplink telemetry . The shuttle is not responding to override signals . I 'm gonna let ' em fly by wire . - l 'm cutting off telemetry . - lt might not work . - We have to give it a chance . - We have to bring them down . We have to give them control of the ship to perform that rotation and deliver the payload . What if they can 't ? We could be stranding them . Abandon telemetry . Go to fly-by-wire mode . They 're cutting off ground control . The astronauts will be flying the shuttle . is it gonna work ? OTC , this is Houston . How 's the weather up there ? Sunny and warm , Houston . What 's the forecast ? OTC , we 're going to fly-by-wire mode . We 're going to abort ground control to see if you can bring those systems back up . Roger that , Houston . And leave the driving to us . David ... You take care . What just happened ? They cut off contact with the shuttle . Negative . We pulled off the MPG . We 're on manual . 45 seconds . If they were able to execute , they 'd have done it by now . Standing by . 60 seconds . Go to re-establish uplink communication . Video signal 's failed . OTC , this is Houston . Do you copy ? OTC , this is Houston . Where are you ? Howdy do , Houston ? Looks like we finally got this bird to fly right . - OTC , do you hear that ? - Music to our ears . Cabin temperature stabilising . OTC , this is Marc Belt in Houston . How 's the crew holding up ? They 're looking good , sir . You all get some rest . We 'll get back to work - at about 0700 . - Roger that , Houston . Let 's get to work on that telemetry problem . We 've got a big day ahead of us . Let 's just let the electronic press get their sound equipment set . I know you have a lot of questions . I 'll get to them . How did he know what he did was going to work ? He didn 't . They could have died up there and there 's nothing we could have done . They 'd have been a ghost ship stuck in orbit . Why would he take that risk ? Bring those men back without delivering that payload ? You 're talking millions of wasted dollars . That 's all Congress would need to shut down NASA . As of 2200 hours the crew has been conducting on-board tests and tasks and resting up for their first full day in space tomorrow . I 'm happy to say , after a beautiful night launch , the shuttle orbiter has performed ... magnificently . So much for your boyhood hero . Colonel Belt ? Colonel Belt ? Can I talk to you for a moment ? You want to know why I lied to them . You 're asking yourself if I 'd lie to you . You know what it means to be an astronaut , sir ? You risk your life every time you get into your spacecraft . For nothing more than the good progress of mankind . You 've got no argument from me , sir . - You 're true American heroes . - Heroes ? We used to make headlines when we did ourjob right . Now they bury you in the back of the paper . Name two astronauts in the last shuttle mission . You make the front page today only if you screw up . They only know your name if you 're the unlucky s.o.b. sitting on 500 tons of dynamite . That 's what they 're really waiting for . Sir , I have to ask . I 'm sorry. lt 's my job . Do you think someone is sabotaging the shuttle ? My answer to you , sir , will be to bring those men back safely to Earth . - l 've got ... - How 's it going out there ? - There 's something out here ! - Can you repeat that , Commander Belt ? It 's coming at me ! Holy God ! Houston , we just heard something weird . OTC , Houston . Can you describe it ? Sort of a dull thump like ... something bumped the ship ! Have you got any ideas about that ? There it is again ! We 're taking a look at it now . That one right there . They 've got an oxygen leak on board the orbiter . Our O2 gauges are going all screwy , Houston . We got problems . An O2 leak in the main tank . What did they say happened ? - They don 't know . They said it was a thump . - Stand by . An astronomer in Winnipeg just spotted a mile-long gaseous cloud trailing in our orbit . The liquid O2 leaking out into space . Exactly what happened to Colonel Belt on an Apollo mission . How much time do they have ? Hard to say without accurate telemetry data . We 're doing a guesstimate . - Where is Colonel Belt ? - He was due 90 minutes ago to begin payload deployment . Uh , Houston , we 're up here wondering - when do we start holding our breath ? - We 're working on it , OTC . I need those calculations and a worst-case scenario . We don 't know if both O2 tanks are damaged . Worst-case scenario ! - And someone find Colonel Belt ! - We 'll find him . They 've got 30 minutes of oxygen . Then it 's anybody 's guess . Why does she need Belt ? She doesn 't know how serious the leak is . Even I can figure out what happens when you run out of oxygen . Colonel Belt 's been in the same situation . He 'll know what to do . Where the hell is he ? Colonel Belt ! Colonel Belt ! I 'm gonna go get Security . Colonel Belt . Are you all right ? Yeah , I wasn 't feeling well . They need you at Mission Control . There 's been another accident . OTC , is your orbital manoeuvring system still operational ? Roger , Houston . We 're ready for re-entry . Just say the word . How bad 's the leak ? We have no way to determine . OTC . What 's the condensation in your cabin ? The windows are getting steamy . Carbon dioxide build-up . OK , OTC . Everything 's gonna be fine . I want you to get in your spacesuits and depressurise your cabin . And then I want you to ... vent that CO2 . - Roger , Houston . Then what ? - l want you to stay in your suits . And then I want you to prepare to use your emergency oxygen systems . And then I want you to ... to ... deliver your payload . Those are men up there . You 're out of line . You wanna tell me how to do my job ? I 've been in that situation . There 's more at risk than your personal life . If you can 't accept that or operate effectively in these circumstances , you 'd better leave the decisions to people in this room who can ! OTC , do you copy ? Roger , Houston . We 're waiting on those O2 calculations . Michelle ! - They 're gonna die ! - You don 't know that . It 's unconscionable putting that payload before those men 's lives ! I think she 's right , Mulder . You saw him in there . He 's losing it . - He saved their lives earlier . - Or put them in unnecessary jeopardy . If he can 't deliver that payload , Congress will kill the Space Program . - So will killing the astronauts . - Somebody must have sabotaged the shuttle . Too many things have gone wrong . - l think Colonel Belt knows about it . - We 've got to stop him . - Pull them out of orbit ! - He doesn 't want them to die . - How do you know ? - l know it. I 'm sure of it . - He put them up there ! - And only he can get them down alive . How can you be certain that what he 's doing isn 't gonna save their lives ? Now , I need access to your records , in a hurry . Everything on the Hubble telescope , Mars Observer and the current orbiter mission . Tens of thousands of documents . - What are we looking for ? - X-rays , diagrams , schematics . - Proof that Belt knew about a sabotage . - A needle in a haystack . Payload deployment initiated . Roger that , OTC . Tracking it now . Looks good from here . Payload delivery is complete , Houston . We 're awaiting your order . System check for re-entry de-orbit burn . Holy God ! There 's something outside the ship that ... - There 's someone outside the ship ! - Can you repeat that , OTC ? There 's ... some kind of ghost outside the ship ! No ... No ... Mulder ? I found it . This is the same diagram that was sent to Michelle . Ordered by Colonel Belt . Which means he knew about the faulty valve . This is from the Challenger. lt 's the O-ring fitting that failed , dated January 21st , 1986 . One week before the space shuttle blew up . The analysis was ordered by Colonel Belt . So he might have known about the Challenger defect ? Something weird is going on here , Scully . Colonel Belt 's collapsed . He 's in his office . He was just here ! Oh , my God . What 's wrong with him ? Get a doctor . Help me ! - Help me ! - How can we help you , Colonel ? He 's having some kind of a seizure . Come on ! Come on , come on ! No ... They 're ... tearing me apart ! Let me see if I can get a pulse . Oh ... Help me ! - l 'm bringing that shuttle down . - No ! - lt 's out there ! - Come on , let 's put him down . - Spacesuit ... - Easy , easy . - Strap him down ! - Give him 10mg of diazepam ! - No ! - He 's gonna hurt himself ! He 's trying to tell us something ! Colonel Belt ? - Those men are running out of oxygen . - They don 't have to die . Colonel Belt , I want you to focus . Focus your breathing . Focus your pain ... right here . Blood pressure 's 174 over 120 . Vitals are rising . - Mulder , you 're risking an aneurysm . - Focus ! Now you 're focused . Right here . Now you 're gonna save those astronauts and you 're gonna tell me how to do it . The shuttle ... can 't survive re-entry . - He 's lying . - How do you know it can 't survive ? The fuselage ... the fuselage is damaged . - The silicone tiles are destroyed . - How does he know ? - How has it been damaged ? - l 'm responsible . - Did you sabotage the shuttle ? - No , but I couldn 't stop them . Nobody could stop them ! - Stop who ? - Pulse is 194 . - You 'll kill him , Mulder ! - Stop who ? They don 't want us to know ! - They don 't want us to know ! - Who ? ! It came to me. lt lives in me ! It 's coming at me ! It 's coming at me ! No ! Help me ! It 's coming back ! That 's the face I saw in the fog ! - We 're losing him ! - V-fib ! Here you go . Clear ! They just ran out of oxygen . They 've got 30 minutes left in the emergency system . They 'll suffocate up there. I 've got to bring them down. lt 's the only chance I 've got . Again . Hold on . We 've got vitals . We got a pulse . We 've got to get him to a hospital . OTC , this is Houston , Mission Control . Do you copy ? Roger , Houston . We 've got some spooky stuff up here . OTC , we 're gonna bring you down . We want you to instigate de-orbit burn and begin deceleration . Roger , Houston . We kinda hoped you 'd say that . Activating OMS rockets . All systems go for re-entry . They 're bringing the shuttle down . You said the shuttle would burn up on re-entry . Can we do anything to save it ? Change the trajectory . - Change the trajectory to what ? - Change re-entry trajectory to 35 degrees . T minus 35 seconds to ionosphere re-entry . - Change the re-entry trajectory ! - What ? - Change it to 35 degrees ! - 30 seconds to re-entry . - Colonel Belt ... - l can 't ! - 25 seconds . - lt 's your only shot ! We 'd have to change site and tell them before the blackout . 15 seconds to blackout . I want to know the weather in Albuquerque ! Are we go for an emergency landing ? Landing conditions go in Albuquerque . T minus 5 seconds to blackout . OTC , change your re-entry trajectory to 35 degrees . You 'll land at Kirtland Field in Albuquerque . Do you copy ? - Blackout in effect . - Did they get that transmission ? - Two minutes to re-establish . - Damn it ! - How much oxygen do they have ? - 16 minutes . OTC , this is Houston . Come in , OTC . OTC , this is Houston . Come in , OTC ! Anything ? - What 's the point of their new re-entry ? - 500 miles west of Hawaii . See if Hawaii can ... - Hawaii 's got them on radar . - They made it . Not necessarily . Albuquerque , do you have radar confirmation ? Negative , Houston . Nothing on the screen . OTC , this is Houston . Come in , OTC . OTC , this is Houston ! Come in , OTC ! Houston , this is OTC . You know a good place to eat in Albuquerque ? Thought we could meet for dinner . Whoo ! OTC , welcome home . Welcome home , OTC . You 're lookin ' real good . Yes ! The space shuttle touched down today at 10.56 Central Standard Time . The orbiter delivered its payload after just 13 orbits and returned to Earth without incident . We at NASA are looking forward to our next shuttle mission and to future successful explorations of space , for mankind and for the future of mankind . No more ! I just heard . Something had possessed him . Something he must have seen out there in space . The doctors who examined him said he was experiencing severe dementia . I don 't think he ever really knew exactly how it was working through him . Or , if he ever knew , that he was ... responsible for his own actions . He ordered those X-rays of the damaged parts . You saw what I saw , Scully . I think he was trying to warn her . I think he sent Michelle those X-rays like ... he was trying to reach out to her , without quite knowing why . As if his own instinctual impulse was to ... save those men . While simultaneously trying to kill them ? Scully , we send those men up into space to unlock the doors of the universe . And we don 't even know what 's behind them . I think whatever it was , he took it with him . In the end , that was the only way he knew how to stop it . There 's an investigation , you know . They haven 't ruled out foul play . He gave his own life . As an astronaut , that was something he was prepared to do . Colonel Marcus Aurelius Belt devoted his life to the exploration and understanding of space . Learning its mysteries and experiencing it not just for himself , but for humanity . Lord , take this man 's soul and let it rise up to your heavens , higher than he could ever go as a man . Let him know the true nature of the universe that he sought to learn .

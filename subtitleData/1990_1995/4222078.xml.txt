 During the last moments of this century , a group of strange visitors arrived from another planet . And found one of the most sensual and beautiful of all Earthlings Emmanuelle . To take them on a journey ... around the world . To explore the mysteries of human love and sexual desire . Collecting data , which would change their own world so far away . And thus we embark on an adventure like no other . Emmanuelle . What are you gazing at , my love ? There , at the porthole . Isn 't that Greece ? Theo , I thought I requested the viewports to be cleaned . No Haffron , not grease sports . Greece , the country . Aah ! Isn 't that where the ancient gods resided ? Very good , Captain . Yes , Ares , the god of war . Zeus , the ruler of all the gods . And my favourite ... Let me guess . Afrodite , the goddess of love ? I 'm impressed ! But no . It 's Athena , the goddess of wisdom and of the arts . Yes . Yes , that suits you well . You 're a great teacher of wisdom Thank you . I have ... something to give you . A gift . A surprise . Come . I want to thank you again for visiting Athenas temple . If you have any questions , which I 'm sure some of you do . I 'll be happy to answer them in the gift shop area right outside . Thank you again ... and may you live for eternity . With Athena . Sweet dreams . Haffron ! I 'm Athena ? And I shall be Zeus . But you know I like being myself . Please , Emmanuelle . Just for tonight . You may discover something new about yourself . - Ah , mylord . It has been so long . - It has been too many years , my love . I long to hold you close . You have tought me much about you world , my love I want to show you . Attention all crew members . Transport for shore will now commence . Last one out , please deactivate illumination devices . Yes , I have invited the others to join in the festivities tonight . They believe I have I have had too much fun with you by myself . Cheers . What a wonderful idea . You devil ! Welcome back crew . I hope your stay was pleasant . I have prepared hot baths for your return . Although my sensors are detecting reduced levels of bacteria and Earth grime . Suggesting that you are already squeaky clean . Tell me something ... Yes ? How is it that you can be in this place as you are ? Isn 't there a risk of being discovered ? Not tonight . But how ? To the others in your world we are here only a moment . Time does not not run at the same speed within these grounds that it does in the world beyond . And ... we have ... We have thrown a cloak over the temple while we are here . To those in the world beyond , no one is here . Why couldn 't you have done it the other times ? It takes a great deal of energy . We do it for the space craft while we are in orbit here so that it will not be discovered . But doing it at all other times it would take more power than we have . So you can do it tonight . It 's the last time you 're gonna be here . Never in our exploration of the universe have we found one like you , Emmanuelle . When we first met you all we wanted to know was how your species propagates itself . As i told you then , our species does not have two sexes . We did not really understand how important it was . Two people , being together , spending their lives together , as happens here . Are we really that different from the others that are out there ? If you peole can learn to live with each other in the world ... when you learn to leave your world and travel ... there will be none like you . Are there many other worlds with life on them ? Life is a natural state of the universe . Intelligence is its goal . There are many different paths to that goal . Can they travel like you do ? There are very few that have gone down the path as far as we have . We never had the wars that you have had ... that others have had . The fact that our nature is as it is . That you will produce as we do . That , we are connected with each other as we are . We concentrated our energies elsewhere and advanced rapidly that way . But , do not think we are somehow better than you for this . And in you struggles , your people have created mych of value . Things we never would have thought of . The art your world has made . The religion . Inner life . And none of those things we have done . You are the most interesting person , from the most interesting people ... on the most interesting world we have ever found . Good morning . Allrighty , come here . Please come on in . My name is John and I will be your guide into the ancient tomb of Atherna . Who according to Greek legend lives on to this day . And if you step on to this next room , please I know some of you have the nasty habit of checking ... Welcome back , Captain Haffron . Emmanuelle , I 'm glad to see you 're back to your natural self . I was thinking of other places on Earth I 've never seen . And other places on Earth I perhaps shall never see . And all the places on Earth I wanted to see . With you . We must look for our departure . Yes . It has beed decided . It is not safe . They came too close last night . It is not our purpose to harm the people of your world . The knowledge of our existance would do that . When ? We are not sure . We are not sure what to do about you . You said that , whenever you left , that you 'd take care of me . That you 'd leave me anyplace I wanted to go . Yes . I 'm not sure I know where that is . Well , you are from Paris . I 'm not sure that I can go back there . There will be too many questions . Come with me . I can not . Yes , you can . You can come with me . We can see those places . Together . But , I ... We won 't stay there long enough to get into any trouble . And there can 't be that many people looking for you . Besides , they ... they have to keep their search a secret . People would laugh at them . Most people don 't even think you exist . Besides , it 's your last chance to get the data you need . We can go here and there . A day in each place , maybe even an hour . Have you done it on a boat ? Out on the ocean ? Attention all crew members . Prepare to receive an upload to your tv monitors . Remember to use the latex couter filter for your arousal protection What did you do about food ? Why do you ask ? Because when I suggested that you create this for us . You forgot to bring dinner along . Indeed ! What would you like ? I feel like I am someone else . Let me see to things . What are you doing here ? It 's just like Haffron said . Up in the ship we are feeling the effects of what you are doing without having the good part . We are with you . I remember how to please myself , Emmanuelle . And how to please you . Theo , what have you done ? Our cloaking is down . We 're visible . What ? No ! Attention Alpha team . Unidentified bogey in sector 12 . Authorise unit 1 for detailed analysis . Approach with extreme caution . Activate secondary cloaking . Quickly . Quickly ! We must get the Captain back . We can 't . Not while secondary cloaking is active . Theo , what are we gonna do ? I cannot believe you spilt your drink on the controls and deactivated the cloaking device . It was ... an accident . Anyway , the backup system is operative , right ? Intermittently . We have to get the Captain back on board . He is still on the boat . We cannot . The secondary cloaking will not permit teleportation . We would have to expose ourselves to get him back . Speaking of exposed , Theo , your fly is open . What happened ? Are you all right ? I don 't know . Theo , what if we temporarily jumped the cloaking generator with the anti grav circuit ? Yes , that would give us a short window to get the Captain back . Maybe you should explain . We 'd have a 45 second window to teleport down without revealing our position . You never did study . Theo is mentally defective . Good thinking , Kara . I will go . I will go since it was my carbonated beverage that put us into harms way . Raymod , Tasha . Prepare the anti grav circuits on my command . Oh , our hero ! Haffron , wake up . I 'm not sleeping . I am too hot . It is hotter than a witch 's tit , is it not ? Colder than a witch 's tit . No , I 'm hot . Honestly . I have a good idea . To cool off . A friend of mine has a cabin in the Rocky Mountains . I 'm cold . I do not think this was as a good idea as you thought . You just have to warm me up . Are you warm yet ? A little . Wow . Look who 's back . Mr can 't hold on to a fizzy drink . Well ? What happened ? Where are they ? I do not know . They were not on the boat . They must have teleported elsewhere . Now we will never find them . Do not be so pessimistic . We know where they are . They are on the Earth . Somewhere . Ha ha . Good one , Tasha . Let 's go to China . Attention all passengers . Welcome aboard the Great Wall Express . I 'm glad you gave us such a good reason to do this again . There is another time for this , Haffron . There is only one time to see the great wall . I have seen this before . That is one of two things that humans have built on Earth that can be seen with the naked eye from orbit . What 's the other ? They are three pointed ... The pyramids of Giza . I 've heard it 's very romantic to see them . Let 's go there next . All right . Haffron , They 're checking papers . Papers ? I ... Passports . If you don 't have one of these , you 'll be in trouble . Go hide in the restroom . That will buy us some time . Attention all crew members . Yellow alert ! Theo is taxing his mental capacity to the limit . Explosion inevitable . Perhaps ... we could reverse the flow of the dilithium crystals . The what ? He has been watching those television broadcasts again . Yes. you know , the one with the pointy ear character . Theo , there is no such things as dilithium crystals . You should know that . I liked " The next generation " better anyway . Captain Haffron . Don 't worry . Captain . Winbush told me who you are . I would not wish to make him angry by betraying your secret . Come in Captain . I 'm sure the guards will not trouble you if you are with me . Papers , please . Of course . Almost getting caught is very exiting . I should have to think of new ways to fall into jeopardy . Welcome to the Peoples Republic of China . Good day . Yes ? Your papers , please . Dog . I 'm commissioner Li Tsiu . Do you wish to keep your career ? Who is that ... ? You dare ask me questions ? I 'm involved with international negotiations of the most delicate nature . Impotent fool ! Haffron ? Passive locating beam . What ? We can modulate a passive locating beam through the secondary cloaking , right ? Yes , but we still can 't get the Captain while the cloaking is on . Mmm . As soon as he uses his transmod , we pick up the signal . Then we jump the cloaker with the anti-grav like before and get him in the 45 second window . But ... This time he will be there . Maybe . It 's the only idea I have right now . Does anyone have a better one ? I will activate the locating beam . Is there no way I can see the real you before you leave ? I 'm sorry . I cannot . But ... Humans live a relatively long life . You 're young and have much ahead of you . You may think as you do now , but ... someday events may bring you to think differently . Think of us differently . Perhaps some day the attitude of the people of your world will change towards us . You are one of very few who have direct knowledge of us . It 's better that we know each others spirits . I cannot leave you here knowing too much . I must leave . Yes . You have learn well what Reimpash taught you . I 've been so scared . Where were you ? I ... I was taking care of important matters . I ... I should thought to ... have asked you about such things before I ... Priority 1 tactical alert . Electromagnetic anomality detected in sector 12 . Deploy strike force immediately . Theo . We are being intermittently painted by Earth radar . Several fixed-wing fighters are heading toward us on high altitude intercept . They cannot break the stratosphere . Can they ? They may have anti-satellite missiles . Roger , blue leader . Home again on VLF wave location . The conductor . I still don 't have my port pass . Pass port . I do not have one of those either . Remember what you said about the pyramides of Giza ? The pointy things ? I 've always wanted to see one of those from a Nile cruiser . Say no more . Theo ! I have coordinates of the Captain ! Kill the cloaker . Transport me to his coordinates . Let us review our situation . Captain Haffron is stranded on Earth . Our primary cloaking is inoperative . We are intermittently being tracked by Earth radar . And fighter interceptors are heading toward us . Possibly bearing anti-satellite missiles . But ... we keep changing orbits . So they cannot interpolate our heading . The cloaking system needs repair . Because Theo spilled a fizzy cola drink on the console . Shorting out our primary cloaking device . The secondary cloaker is on , but malfunctioning . And the only time we can locate the Captain ... Is when he uses his transmod . And then we only have seconds to lock on before he transfers elsewhere . Well , this is a fine mess you 've gotten us into . Yes , Theo . A fine mess indeed . Your attention , please . Lunch is now being served on deck one . It 's not the same . How do you mean ? We can 't go out on deck . We have to hide . But you are the one who ... I know ... I know . I 'm the one who want us to be safe so I say that stay inside ... What I really want , is for us to be together . Not have to worry about being seen by others . You want to be chased , but not caught . The thrill of getting away with it excites you . Yeah . You 're right Do you think I 'm awful , Haffron ? How could I think such a thing as that , Emmanuelle ? I did never think badly of you . Really ? Really . Good evening . Good evening , sir . Pardon me . Theo , I think we should break orbit and try to repair the primary cloaking device . I refuse to abandon the Captain ! I will take control of the ship first . I am first officer . I take full responsibility here . We will not break orbit . Our passive locator beam is still operative ? Yes , Theo . Very well . We will continue to evade the Terran interceptors until Captain Haffon uses his transmod once again . This time we will get him . Thank you . We better stop doing that . We are not going to get out of here . Is that bad ? No ... But the temple of Karnak is one of the oldest things created by humans on earth . Very well . Your attention please . All passengers wishing to join the afternoon excursion tour , please come to the gangway now . Did someone try to rob us ? They did rob us . My transmod has been stolen and the thief used it to rearrange matter in this room . Your device . What are we gonna do ? How are we gonna get back to the ship ? I have a secondary unit . It 's not as powerful , but we can communicate with the others . This is the Captain . I require a landing party immediately . My transmod has been stolen . Captain Haffron to ship . Respond . Something is wrong . We must return immediately . How ? With this unit we can track the primary transmod . We must catch the thief . Table for one ? Excuse us . Hello . Table for two ? Right there . Attention crew . Low frequency transmod signal has been detected . These signals are associated with object manipulation . They are not powerful enough to detect the Captain 's current whereabouts . Come . We have to wait . I 'm so sorry . You have done nothing wrong . Yes , I did . I made you come here . I put you in danger , again . If I hadn 't , you 'd be gone now . And safe . I chose to come back here , Emmanuelle . I came to be with you . To see these places with you . I didn 't want to leave . You gave me a reason to convince the others to stay a while longer . But don 't you see ? If I hadn 't said all that , you wouldn 't have had to convince the others . You 'd be safe . I would rather be here with you than safe . Anything yet ? I 'm sorry , Theo . No signal from the Captain 's transmod . Come on , Captain . Don 't worry , Theo . We 'll get him back . We can 't do this now , Haffron . We can 't do anything until he uses it again . Then we know where he is . Whoa . Yeah , babe . Theo , I 've got a signal . He 's in ... Egypt . Drop the cloaking . Use the active magnar search . Track him . But we will be exposed . I know . We have to take the risk . Do it ! He 's transporting . We must follow him . Theo , I have a second signal . Also in ... Egypt . How could that be ? The Captain 's backup transmod . Perhaps Emmanuelle is using it . Raymond . Where did they go ? We seem to be in China . It 'll be as hard for him to hide as it will be for us . Too bad you can 't know which way he went . I will transport down immediately . Roger , blue leader . Bogey spotted . Move to intercept . Theo , a Terran interceptor have locked radar on us . He could fire a missile at any moment . Think , Theo . Think . Reactivate cloaking . Drop active locator beam . Change orbit . Change orbit ! He 's very close . How can we find him ? Hey ! You want your thing , right ? Yes . It 's worth something , right ? It is of no value to you or anyone else who doesn 't know how it works . It 's worth something to you . What is your name , Sir ? Griffin . Well , Griffin , would you like to return to where you came from ? Damn right , I would If you give it back to us , we can do that for you . Is that fair ? Where are we ? China . How do I know that you 'll do that for me ? We dont want bring you any harm , Griffin . We just want it back . Where are you from ? Paris . Paris ? The one in France ? The only one . No it 's not . I 've been to Paris , Texas . And I don 't want to go back . Yes , I 'm from Paris , France . Okay . I 'm coming out . It really is you . Well , of course , Griffin . You should have stayed on the boat . In egypt . I would agree with you . Now . What is this ? It 's the result of a government experiment , Sir . It 's highly classified . Here . Take it . Where would you like to go , Griffin ? Anywhere , huh ? Yes . L.A. L.A. ? Yeah . Hollywood . All right . Theo . I have a signal on the passive locator . Standby to drop cloaking . But , Theo ... Quickly ! Raymond . Lock on those coordinates . On my signal , I want you to transport everything within 5 feet of those transmods . Yes , sir . And ... Drop cloaking . Transport . Cloaking back on . Get us out of here . Now . Welcome back , Captain . We have much to tell you You did well , Theo 205 . I will commend you on our return . Thank you , Captain . However , perhaps we should institute a " no refreshments " policy in the control room ? Aye , Captain . And now if I may ask your indulgence I would like to be alone with Emmanuelle for a few minutes . The time has come , my love . No , I 'll come with you . As much as my heart desires , I cannot ask that of you . You must return . I 've never heard you speak of your heart before . I did not know I had one before you showed it to me . No , it is all too heavy . I will return . Soon . I must recommend to my superiors that further studeis must be undertaken . And I will bravely volunteer to lead the next mission . Before you go , perhaps we should review your lessons ? To ... be sure you have them all ? Oh , it would only prolong our goodbye . Then so be it . Just a few more hours ? Subtitles by Ed

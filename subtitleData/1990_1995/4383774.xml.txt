What was that ? - What 's happening ? It 's OK , it 's OK. I just had a flat . - Oh , no ! - No problem here , honey . Darn it ! Honey , would you hold the light ? Paul ! Where are you ? Paul ? ! What happened ? ! Paul ! Over here ! I 've found something ! His leg 's been eaten off . Hey ! Up here ! I need some help ! It 's in here ! It 's as tall as a house ! - We can smoke him out . - And then what ? - l see it ! - He 's coming at us ! X-Files Season 1 Episode 05 - The Jersey Devil Agent Finley speaking . Working hard , Mulder ? This woman claims she was taken aboard a spaceship and held in an anti-gravity chamber for three days . Anti-gravity is right . Sorry to interrupt your serious investigation . - l heard a story that 'll take your knees out . - What 's that ? They found a body in the New Jersey woods yesterday , missing its right arm and shoulder . They think they may have been eaten off ... by a human . - Where in New Jersey ? - Just outside Atlantic City . Not an uncommon place to lose a body part . They think it 's the Mob ? He was a homeless man . There 's no motive . You feeling lucky , Scully ? Relative to whom ? It 's not our case , Mulder . The local police are handling it . An X-File ? Ever hear of something called the Jersey Devil ? A beast that 's supposed to come out of the woods and attack cars , like an East Coast Bigfoot . Read the file about the case in 1947 . Save me the trouble . 1947 . Family watches Dad get dragged off into the woods . Cops find Dad with a few appendages gnawed off . Cops corner a large , naked man in the woods and gun him down . Autopsy shows human flesh and bones in his intestine . A beast man . - ls the autopsy report here ? - Requisition for a car . No . The original disappeared from the files after the incident . - There is a statement from the pathologist . - l 've heard this story since I was a kid . - lt 's a folk tale , a myth . - l heard the same story when I was a kid , too . Funny thing is , I believed it . Thanks , Doreen . Fact is , we 've got a cannibalised body in New Jersey . Someone or something out there is hungry . They say animals can develop an appetite for human flesh , but ... this is no animal . See the teeth marks , just below the clavicle ? They 're human . - Who found the body ? - A park ranger . Was he alive when it happened ? It 's hard to tell . There 's no sign of a struggle . His blood alcohol level was up . - Probably never knew what hit him . - Any ideas about that ? From the size of that bite mark , I 'd say large , adult male . - Detective Thompson is handling the case . - Glenna ? Hi. I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder . I don 't remember anybody calling the fbi in on this . We 're not here officially . Agent Scully is a medical doctor . We heard about your victim and thought we 'd look . I 'm sorry. I 'm going to ask you to leave . - We have an investigation . - Tommy , this is no time to get pissy . - We have jurisdiction here . - Any suspects yet ? I don 't work for you , sir . Unless you hear from the attorney general , this is a local matter . - Agent Mulder , we should go . - No need to get bent out of shape ! On the contrary , I think I 've been exceedingly polite . - So what 's eating that guy ? - He was perfectly in his rights . The fbi has no overriding jurisdiction in a murder case . You 'd feel the same if someone horned in on your work . Chances are , he 'll be scratching his head when they bring the next body in . You could have really humiliated him and told him who the perpetrator was . The Jersey Devil . What do you say we grab a hotel , take in a floor show , drop quarters in the slot , do a little digging on this case . - You 're kidding ? - OK , skip the floor show . - Mulder , I have to be back in DC . - Have you got a date ? No . I have my godson 's birthday party at 6.30 . - What are you doing ? - A little poking around . - Maybe make a weekend out of it . - lt 's a three-hour drive back by myself . In Friday night traffic . Change of fifty . I found the body just over there , lying face down on the rocks . 32 years with the Parks Service , I 've seen some weird stuff , but never anything like this . The victim was a homeless man . You get many wandering around ? Well , occasionally , you 'll see some , but ... most are scared of the woods . Scared ? Of what ? I don 't know . The devil . - People say that 's just a myth . - Depends on who you talk to . What do you think ? Well , like I said , 32 years , I see a lot of weird stuff . Like one time , a little over four years ago , I saw what I thought was a large man come out of a copse of birch trees . Not a stitch of clothing . He was about sixty yards away . And he starts sniffing the air , you know , like a dog . And then he looked straight at me , and I swear he smelled me , because he took off into the woods so fast you 'd swear he wasn 't human . Really ? - You never saw him again ? - No . But I feel him . And ... I 've found things . Some scat , half-buried , like a cat 's , only more human . Found a half-eaten rabbit with what looked like a human cuspid tooth , and deer bones , looked like they 'd been sharpened into tools . You think it 's responsible for the body you found ? Well ... I got a pension coming up in a few years . You know , you say the wrong thing ... I 'll tell you one thing . I don 't ever come out here without my weapon any more . How far is it into town from here ? About a mile , a mile and a half . I 'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway for a couple of days . - lf you think of anything , will you call me ? - Sure . Look at this gorilla mask ! Where am I ? I can 't see ! Where am I ? It 's OK. lt 's all right . What happened ? Did you bump your head ? Cruiser ! Stop that ! Go on . What happened ? - Jungle warfare . - l could kill that dog . If the hit squad doesn 't get to him before you do . I am so glad you 're here , Dana . Hey ! Get off me ! Cruiser ! Cruiser , get down ! Oh ! - You 're amazing . - What ? You 're a natural . I don 't know how you keep it together . Mommy radar . I don 't think I 'm cut out for this , El . You went to the fbi Academy . What better training for motherhood ? Seriously . You 're great with kids . What do you mean ? - When do I find the time ? - First you have to get a life . Of course , it helps if you can find a man . - Know of any ? - They 're disappearing faster than the Brazilian rainforest . - What about that guy you work with ? - Mulder ? - l thought you said he was cute . - He 's a jerk . He 's not a jerk . He 's ... He 's obsessed with his work . Hi. I 'm Rob . Scott 's dad . - Oh ! Come in . - Thanks . Hey , tiger ! How you doing ? You having a good time ? Divorced . Did anybody here know Roger Crockett ? He was murdered two days ago . Ma 'am , can I ... Roger Crockett ? Anybody ? What do you want to know ? Did you know Roger Crockett ? Did you hear how he died ? Yeah . Any ideas who might have done it ? You a cop ? No , I 'm fbi . I 'll show you something . OK . I need some money . - What is this ? - Stuck in the pocket of ajacket I found . Does it mean anything to you ? - l 've seen it . - Where ? - Right here , digging in the trash . - Here ? Are you hustling me ? Swear to God . - What do you think it is ? - l don 't know . It scared the hell out of me . - Has anybody else seen it ? - Everybody 's pretty freaked . - Anybody told the cops ? - You think they don 't know ? - Where are you sleeping tonight ? - You 're standing in my bedroom . You know the Galaxy Gateway ? Room 756 . Go ahead . They got HBO ? Yeah . They do . Sir ? - You got a man up on that roof . - Nothing to be afraid of . - We can give you a warm place to sleep it off . - Hey ! Back off ! - There 's a man up on that roof ! - Get in the car ! Now ! - What the hell are you doing ? ! - Enjoying the nightlife here in Atlantic City . I 'll go right to the DA 's office if I have to . - Obstructing an investigation . Misconduct . - Let 's go see her together . - We could add " withholding evidence " . - What are you talking about ? Statements given to you describing something stalking the city . This is the fishing trip they get me up at three in the morning for ? Unbelievable ! Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight ? You know it 's out there . I got a perpetrator out there . Whether it 's Hannibal the Cannibal or Elmer Fudd , I 've got ajob to protect people . is that yourjob ? Or is it to keep the dice rolling ? The tour buses rolling in ? You can 't fill those casinos , this town disappears like a quarter down the slot . I 've seen it . Seen what ? You 've been spending too much time in supermarket checkout lines . That story 's as old as the hills . Who 's gonna be responsible when you lose your first tourist , Detective ? - You are . - No , you are , sir . Because you 're wasting my time and impeding the solution of this case . You wanna go on a safari , go to Africa . In the meantime , enjoy the rest of your weekend . Agent Scully ! Agent Mulder , line three . Where are you ? - Not far from where you left me . - You 're still in Atlantic City ? Scully , you got anything happening this morning ? What 's that noise in the background ? - That 's a guy getting sick . - Mulder , where are you ? The drunk tank ? It 's not hard to see why they mistook you for a vagrant . Are you gonna rag on me or take me to get something to eat ? Am I buying ? Or did you manage to panhandle some change while you were at it ? It moved like a cat . Quick and graceful . There 's no way a human could 've gotten up on the roof that fast . - Mulder ... - What ? What happens when word gets back to the Bureau ? They dropped the charges . Thompson did it to spite me . - l 'm talking about this Jersey Devil . - lt 's exactly like the ranger described . The way it moved , sniffed the air ... - lt 's probably in search of food . - Yeah , I 'll say ! It was in the garbage . If it was a man-eater , why didn 't it go for me ? - lt probably felt threatened . - You 've already given it a motive and alibi . It chewed somebody 's arm off . Hardly a defensive posture . - You do believe I saw something ? - You saw something , I 'll give you that . But I 'm not about to go in and sell a sighting in a dark alley . - l 've still got a hotel room I 'm paying for . - l have to get back to Washington by 7.30 . - Got another birthday party ? - No . I have a date . Can you cancel ? Unlike you , Mulder ... I would like to have a life . I have a life . Come on. I have somebody I want you to meet on the way home . Come on . Hold on . Just about every culture has one . Yeti , Sasquatch , Just about every culture has one . Yeti , Sasquatch , Russian almas , sonnequat . - Why is that ? - lt 's a universal wild-man myth . A fear of our dual natures as humans , as creators of life and destroyers of it . - What 's this chart ? - lt shows the historic entry of man onto each continent , and the effect on other species , - which , as you see , has been disastrous . - Why ? We humans have retained hereditary traits that have proven to be extremely destructive . We tend to be tribal , aggressively territorial , oriented by selfish sexual and reproductive drives that make co-operation beyond the family or tribe extremely hard for us . We kill other species in order to survive ? Humans sit at the top of the food chain , and we reduce other species chances of survival . I 'm glad Dana left here with more than a degree ! What if something entered the food chain above us ? It won 't happen . Our intelligence virtually ensures that , barring the introduction of alien life , we will live our days as rulers of the world . But what if , by some fluke of nature , a human was born who reverted to its most animal instincts ? A carnivorous Neanderthal . Wouldn 't he be above us on the food chain ? Sure . All he 'd have to do is wait outside any fast-food restaurant and eat us on the way in . Haven 't there been cases of men raised in the wilderness by animals who have no language and hunt like predators ? Several . But cannibalism is rare . - Even among the lower mammals . - When faced with extinction ? Maybe in the jungles of New Guinea ... lt 's highly unlikely that what you 're suggesting could have survived in the woods of New Jersey . Highly unlikely , but not outside the realm of extreme possibility ? Well , it would be an amazing discovery . The hard thing was when my wife remarried . I felt very competitive for my son 's attention . - lt was weird . - l 'm sure . I became a superdad on the weekends with Scott . I had this unconscious fear of being replaced . I had dreams where l was running over his stepfather with my car . You 'll understand when you have kids . They change everything . That 's what they say . Maybe some weekend we could take the kids to the beach . - Yeah ! - Great . Thank you . Can I ask about the case you 're on , or can 't you say ? I don 't think it 's a case we should discuss over dinner . I don 't suppose you want to hear about the finer points of estate planning and taxation ? Mulder . This is Peter Brullet of the Jersey Parks Department . Oh , yeah . Hi . I found a body out in the woods today , looks like it 's been dead six to eight months . A long-haired male , missing the same tooth I found in that rabbit . - Could be your devil . - Where 's the body now ? - With the coroner 's office . - You 're sure it was a male ? It had all the plumbing . Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Excuse me . - Scully . - Mulder . - Sorry to interrupt your evening . - That 's OK . What 's up ? I just had an amazing thought . Maybe it isn 't a beast man we 're looking for , after all . If they picked it up , nobody logged the body on the chart. I sure haven 't seen it . What else would they have done with it ? We may have called you for nothing . - They 're trying to sweep it under the carpet . - Why ? Any publicity , and the streets are crawling with people who aren 't playing crap tables . Word gets out it 's on the loose , forget it . - You said it was a female ? - The body was a male . There 's a chance there was a mate . We have to find out . What are the chances of capturing it alive ? If it is a primate , it would have a natural fear of heights . It would also want to stay close to its food source . This thing has no fear of heights . We 'll stay together and start with the lower floors . - How much time will that dart give us ? - lt 'll put down a bear for an hour . If I hit it . - What 's a park-ranger vehicle doing here ? - l don 't know . Check it out . Run a check for me . There 's something here ! It 's blood . She could be bringing her killing here . She could be injured . Roger . Zebra Team in position . What if it is a female , Scully ? How close is she to you or me ? Does she feel emotion ? Or are her days just spent ... looking for food ? Maybe she spends her day shopping . Eight million years out of Africa . We 're not all that different . We 've put men into space . Built computers that work faster than the human mind . While we overpopulate the world and create new technologies to kill each other with . Maybe we 're just beasts with big brains . What ? No , I was just ... thinking about my godson 's birthday party . Eight little six-year-old boys running around . Talk about primitive behaviour ! Mulder . He 's a federal agent . Ever hear of him ? No . - You know him ? - No . - What are you doing here ? - l 'm a professor of anthropology . Mulder . That sound familiar ? I know he 's here . Check upstairs , Andrew . I want this place searched top to bottom . Move ! Move ! Mulder ! Mulder , where are you ? Mulder ? ! Scully ! Lay back . Mulder , you 're hurt ! You should have seen her . She was beautiful . She just about ripped your lungs out . She could have torn my head off , but she didn 't cos she sensed I wasn 't a threat . I need federal jurisdiction on this case . Mulder ! - How old would you say she was ? - The assistant DA 's on the phone . - He wants to know what the hell is going on . - Tell him he 's got a Neanderthal on the loose . - She was young . - The Crime Unit has filed a complaint that we 're endangering a murder investigation . - That is such crap . - They 've got her cornered in a building . - Can you see it ? - lt crawled into the wall . - Can you get a man in there ? - Affirmative . - Keep these people out of here ! - Take her alive ! What 's going on in there ? I 've got a man down ! A naked woman jumped from the second storey ! Suspect is headed south into the woods on foot ! I know these woods . She 'll be down by the rocks . Look . Can you reach her from here ? I can try . It tried to take my arm off . Why did you have to kill her ? Same reason you kill a rabid animal . Hi . This just came through . It 's a posthumous medical exam of the woman 's body . They found fragments of human bones still in her digestive tract . They estimated her age to be 25 to 30 years . Now , they allowed Dr Diamond to do a medical exam of the body , but he found nothing that suggested prehistoric bone structure or physiology . Now , the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe . A search for her identity in state psychiatric records has begun in earnest . - Good luck . - They have also released the medical exam from the male body that they found . His age is estimated to be about 40 years . There would have been offspring . The medical exam of the woman 's uterus does indicate that she may have given birth . She was just protecting her children . It all makes sense . The male dies and she comes out in search of food . Mulder , do me a favour . Go and have a beer . Take the day off . I 'll cover for you . Just take some time for yourself . I 've got an appointment at the Smithsonian with an ethno-biologist . Mulder . Yeah , just a second. lt 's for you . - Hello ? - Hi , Dana. lt 's Rob . Oh , hi . Sorry to call you at work , but I have Scott for the night and we have tickets for Cirque de Soleil . We thought you and Trent could join us . Requisition for a car , please . Thank you . Who was that on the phone ? - A guy . - A guy ? Same guy you had dinner with ? - Same guy . - Are you gonna have dinner with him again ? - l don 't think so . - No interest ? - Not at this time . - Thanks , Fran . - What are you doing ? - Going with you to the Smithsonian . - Don 't you have a life , Scully ? - l 'll hurt you like that beast woman . Eight million years out of Africa . And look who 's holding the door . - Dad , did you just see something ? - Where ? - Over there . - l 'm sure it was nothing . - No , I saw something . - Ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil ? When I was a kid , my dad used to tell this story about a creature who lived out in the woods . It was half-man , half-animal . I used to believe that story . Subtitles by : syafiQ a.k.a basikalbaru

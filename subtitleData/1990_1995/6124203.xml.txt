 Are you gonna leave this up all year ? Yup . All year . Since you always made us take the tree down the day after Christmas I 'm making up for lost time . If your idea of a good time is to pick up dried pine needles , treat yourself . As if he 's an authority on having a good time ! - That 's OK , Mom , I got that . - OK . OK , Maggie . Let 's shove off . OK . Thank you for having us . Dinner was delicious , as usual . Thanks , Mom . Good sailing , Ahab . Good night , Starbuck . How 's work ? Good ? Yup . It 's good . Drive carefully . Good night , Daddy . Here on " Incredible Inventions " , you 're not going to spend $ 110 for it . You all know that . You 're not even going to spend $ 100 . There 's an approximate one month supply here . And all you 'll spend for this entire package is just $ 39.92 ... Dad ? I thought you guys left . Where 's Mom ? Hello ? Hello ? Dana ? Mom ? What 's the matter ? We ... We lost your dad . He had ... a massive coronary about an hour ago . He 's gone . I swear ! Christmas Day ! My whole family 's opening presents an ' all . And I 'm just sitting there in my own little world , thinking , " I just wish Jim were here . " I know . Oh , man ! Busted ! - Yes , sir ? - Out of the vehicle , please . Sir , I 'm sorry . We 'll be on our way . I said , out of the vehicle . Keep your hands down . Let 's see some ID . No , not till I see yours . Last time you were that engrossed , you were reading Adult Video News ! I didn 't think you 'd be in today . How are you , Dana ? Dana ... I 'm fine , thank you . What are you working on ? Two days ago , a couple was kidnapped at Jackson University . Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers . Both nineteen . Last year another couple was kidnapped to the day . Except that abduction occurred at Duke University . One week later , they found both students ' bodies - dead . They were kept alive , tortured during that period . No arrests were ever made . Police believed it to be a one-time offender . Now it appears to be a serial incident . If he holds true to form , we have five days to find those kids . That 's a grim deadline . Here 's another grim deadline . In one week , Luther Lee Boggs will take a seat in the North Carolina gas chamber . How is he related ? He claims to have information relating to the kidnapping . He described Hawley 's bracelet exactly . This is information that only family members could have known . Or the kidnapper . Boggs feels that if his talents help save these kids , his sentence should be reduced to life in prison . His " talents " ? He claims to have obtained this information through psychic transmissions . Mulder , do I detect a hint of skepticism ? Perhaps . Boggs has been there before . In the chamber . My profile helped send him there . He was actually strapped to the chair before receiving an executive stay . He claims that this experience activated in him the ability to channel spirits and demons . I believe in psychic ability , without a doubt . But not in this case . Not Boggs . So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from the inside ? A scam to save his life ? At the age of six , Luther Boggs slaughtered every pet animal on his housing project . When he was 30 , he strangled five family members over Thanksgiving dinner , and then watched the Detroit-Green Bay game . Some killers are products of society . Some act out past abuses . Boggs kills because he likes it . And they 've requested you speak with him ? Actually , he 's requested to speak to me . Why you ? He read my profile on him and he feels like I 'm the only one who truly understands what he is . - I leave for Raleigh this afternoon . - I 'll go with you . The funeral 's at noon . I think you should take some time . - I need to work . - I 'm sorry about your father . - I 'll see you later . - OK . As a captain , he was entitled to burial in Arlington with full ceremony . This is exactly the way he wanted it . Just the family . This song was playing when his ship returned from the Cuban blockade . He marched right off , up to me , and he proposed . I know that you and Dad were ... disappointed that I chose the path I 'm on , instead of medicine . But I need to know ... Was he at all proud of me ? He was your father . The soul of Luther Boggs drowns in hell 's sea of fire . We have him now . " We " ? You mean the souls of your victims ? The dead . The living . All souls are connected . And you 're the conduit ? Dana , Fox , please understand that from here we can return to the past . We can see the present , we can know the future ... " From here " ? Where exactly are you ? Mr Boggs must be made redemptive for his transgressions . That 's exactly what the State of North Carolina intends to do next week . Let 's deal . Boggs ' life for the kids . You know what I 'm saying ? First you gotta prove you 're telling the truth . Don 't get me wrong , Luther . I wanna believe . God ! No ! Must stop ! Stop ! Pain ! Pain ... terrible pain . The boy ... Jim ... He 's tied with ... twine . Packing twine . He whups him with a coat hanger , a wire coat hanger . Dark place . Cold . Cellar . Warehouse , condemned . An angel of stone . Waterfall . Water falling . It 's not a waterfall . Not water . They 're there . Oh , God ... I gotta go . I gotta go . I gotta go . I tore this off my New York Knicks T-shirt . It has nothing to do with the crime . ♪ Somewhere ... ♪ ♪ ... beyond the sea ♪ ♪ Somewhere waiting for me ♪ Did you get my message , Starbuck ? Thanks a lot . Scully ? What 's wrong ? Did Boggs say something to you ? No . - It 's my father . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - It 's all right . Why don 't you go back to the motel ? We 've exposed Boggs as a fraud . Boggs is not what he claims to be . He may be orchestrating the kidnapping . Now he knows we 're onto him , he doesn 't have a chance with this charade . I 'm gonna wait around and interrogate him . Hopefully , he 'll tell me where the kids are . ♪ Somewhere ... beyond the shore ♪ ♪ We 'll kiss just as before ♪ ♪ Happy we 'll be ♪ ♪ Beyond the sea ♪ Water falling . Not a waterfall . An angel of stone . It 's Mulder ! Liz Hawley 's family made a positive ID on the charm you found at the warehouse . The police are searching the place inch by inch , but haven 't found anything yet . I expected to find you at the crime scene . Did Boggs confess ? No . No , it was five hours of Boggs 's " channeling " . After three hours , I asked him to summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix and requested " All Along The Watchtower " ! He 's been dead 20 years , but still hasn 't lost his edge ! I lied to the police about how I found the warehouse . - I didn 't notice any " suspicious activities " . - Then how did you find it ? It was where Boggs said it would be . Scully , I told you about Boggs ! I didn 't go looking for it ! I came across an area that had landmarks he spoke of . That 's exactly what Boggs wanted ! He could have been setting you up . You could be dead ! Why did you feel you had to lie on your police report ? It was a better explanation under the circumstances . You didn 't want to go on record admitting that you believed in Boggs . The Bureau would expect something like that from spooky Mulder , but not Dana Scully . I thought that you 'd be pleased that I 'd opened myself to extreme possibilities . Why now ? ! After all we 've seen . Why Boggs ? Does this have to do with your father ? You said that he didn 't approve of you becoming an FBI agent . If being on the job now makes you feel guilty or uncomfortable or uneasy , I think you should back away . Because if it 's clouding your judgment , you 're putting yourself in danger . - I love this job . - You love your father . Dana ... open yourself up to extreme possibilities only when they 're the truth . That goes for Luther Boggs ... and your father . As for Luther Boggs ... he 's the greatest of lies . I know he 's working with someone on the outside and they planted that evidence . We have to be very careful about plotting our next move - he 's planned five steps ahead . The only advantage we have is time . Scully , take a look at this . That 's incredible ! They found them ? - That 's exactly what I want Boggs to think . - Why didn 't the police notify us ? The article is bogus . The Carolinian made it up for us . Only six people know about it . Later on today , Boggs gets his weekly phone privileges . Hopefully , he 'll call his accomplice . Phone privileges in two hours . Go . Turn off that phone . Turn it off . Mulder , it 's you . - Mulder . - How come you don 't believe me ? Agent Scully does . She believes me . Agent Scully believes what we all believe - that you have the kids . Now , where are they ? Mulder ... even if he is setting us up , we have to follow , because in three days ... Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead . A day later , our only connection to the case will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber . We have to deal . The kidnapper 's aroused by the prospect of becoming a killer . What 's the name ? Can 't see . Male . Describe him . Small ... Thin ... Late twenties . Skull . Human skull . Silver gray . His eyes ... cold , very cold , staring at Elizabeth . God ! He 's got the wire ! Please ! No ! Where is he ? He 's over ... by the window . Holding back ... holding back his thoughts of killing . Waiting . There 's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan . You got that ? Mulder . Don 't go near the white cross . We see you down and your blood spills on the white cross . Anything ? Sweep the docks ! Federal agent ! Mulder ! We need an ambulance ! Officer down ! - What have we got ? - Through and through . Upper femur . Let 's get him on the gurney . No . No . No . Lucas Jackson Henry , 28 . Did some time at Angola in Louisiana for sexual assault , narcotics . Nothing big . His personal history includes being witness to an auto accident in which his high-school sweetheart was killed and his mother decapitated . The seven-year anniversary of that accident is in three days . He 's reliving it . That would explain the deadline . The most important element we found is there 's substantial suspicion that Boggs ' last five murders were committed with a partner . The police in Durham say they could never prove it in court , but they know that partner was Lucas Henry . You set us up . You 're in on this with Lucas Henry . This was a trap for Mulder because he helped put you away . Well , I came here to tell you that if he dies because of what you 've done , four days from now , nobody will stop me from being the one that throws the switch and gases you out of this life for good , you son of a bitch ! Dana , you 're the one that believed me . No ! No , I do not believe you ! You don 't believe me ? Maybe you 'll believe yourself . There was that one time when I was fourteen and my parents had gone to bed . I snuck downstairs all alone and got one of my mom 's cigarettes and went out onto the porch in the dark . I was so scared . My heart was beating - they would have killed me if they knew . But I was so excited . Not because of the cigarette - I mean , it was gross - but because I wasn 't supposed to . That could be a moment from any kid 's life . I know what you want . And I know who you wanna talk to . Why don 't you just go ahead and ask me ? I 'll believe you if you let ... me talk to him . Starbuck ... No ! No ! No ! No ... body talks to anybody until I get a deal . Don 't ... underestimate my fear of dying , and don 't downplay my terror of going back to that chair . I know my hell 's going to be to go on back to that chair over and over again for all of time . But in this life , my one and only life , I don 't ever want to go back again ! Ever ! The last time that I went to death 's door and looked inside ... I ain 't never talked to a minister before in my life . Ever . Till that day . And he said , " He who doth not love remains in death . " " And he who hates his brother ... is a murderer , and no murderer has eternal life abiding in him . " My family , who I killed after their last meal , was right there to watch me over mine . And their ... fear and their horror that I made them feel when I killed them was injected into me ! And their collective fear alone was this long taste of hell . And then I felt myself leave my body . But I thought they 'd already killed me . And I saw thousands of souls rushing at my body . It is a cold dark place , Scully . Mulder 's looking in on it right now . It may be a cold , dark place for you , but it 's not for Mulder . And it 's not for my father . I 'm sure he 'd like to tell you hisself . But I 'm not gonna let him . Nobody speaks till you give me a deal . I don 't believe you . There 's plenty of room in that cold , dark place for liars , Scully . You go ahead and play it like you need to , but I know you believe me . But if you need to convince a judge I 'm in on it with Lucas , go ahead . Cause either way , whether I 'm running the show with Lucas or I 'm channeling , no information 's coming till I get a deal . I got nothin ' to lose ! Guard ! If I die , that boy goes to that cold , dark place . The Governor and the Supreme Court of North Carolina do not intend to make a deal with a mass murderer . Especially one who I know is orchestrating a capital offense two days before his capital punishment . Yes , sir . All Boggs will get from me is a timely death . And it 's an overdue one at that . We 're running out of time . There 's still no sign of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers . - The Raleigh police said ... - No matter what , don 't believe him . Boggs created this whole charade to get back at me for putting him on death row . You 'd be the next best thing . Mulder , I never thought I 'd say this , but what if there 's another explanation ? Don 't ... deal with him . He could be trying to claim you as his last victim . All right , Mr Boggs , you got your deal . Thank you , ma 'am . Thank you . All right , where are they ? Let 's see , like ... Circles . I don 't know , like ... barrels . No . No , bigger , like ... huge ... vats . Factory . Condemned . The Old ... Blue ... Devil Brewery , out by Morrisville . God , he 's getting ... he 's getting ready . He ... He ... He 's getting ready to ... He 's getting ready to kill the ... Luther , if you really were psychic ... I 'd have known you lied . That there never was a deal . I know you tried . Scully . Avoid the Devil . Don 't follow Henry to the Devil . Leave that to me . Freeze ! Federal agents ! We 're armed ! Drop your weapon . Go ! You come to say goodbye ? I believe ... that if you had orchestrated this kidnapping ... Lucas Henry would have been aware of the danger you warned me about . He never would have crossed that bridge . So you saved ... Jim Summers ' life . But you saved mine as well . You come for some unfinished business . You want your father 's message . Not now . You be there tonight - my witness . When they got me in that chair and they ... open up that shield ... you 'll get your message . Our Father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done on earth , as it is in heaven . Would you like to make a statement ? And forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those that trespass against us . And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : For thine is the kingdom , the power , and the glory , for ever and ever . Amen . I was considering Boggs . If he knew that I was your partner , he could have found out everything he knew about me - about my father ... - Scully . - Beyond The Sea played at their wedding . Visions of deceased loved ones are a common psychological phenomenon . - If he knew that my father had ... - Dana . After all you 've seen , after all the evidence , why can 't you believe ? I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid to believe . You couldn 't face that fear ? Even if it meant never knowing what your father wanted to tell you ? But I do know . How ? He was my father .

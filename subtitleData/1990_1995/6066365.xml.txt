 ( male # 1 ) 'Superboy , did you hear me ? ' I 'm sorry . We know you couldn 't possibly have done what you are accused of . But we need to ask you a few questions . Of course . According to Adam Verrell 's statement you were highly agitated when you arrived at the ceremony . You went back .. ... to see a Miss Lana Lang . When he came to check on you .. ... he found you holding her dead body . He 's saying I killed her . How can you believe a man like him ? What motive do I have ? He suggested jealousy over some pending marriage to Miss Lang . Jealous ? Of him ? He 's involved in this . I just don 't know how yet . Mr. Verrell 's a prominent citizen of Capitol City . We can 't just disregard his statement . But this can 't simply be his word against mine . You must have evidence . We do . The coroner 's report confirms Mr. Verrell 's statement . ' " Her lungs were completely collapsed " as if the air had been virtually sucked out of them by something superhuman . " Which poses a problem for us . There are those who 'll demand justice . - ' A trial . ' - Of course . I expect to be treated like any other citizen . We 're all quite relieved that you 're cooperating , Superboy . We know how easy it would be for you to .. Everything will be fine in no time . No . I don 't think so . ( Adam on TV ) 'Remember , things are never Crime is bad .. ... and jobs are good . Change your lives now while there 's still time . Ask for forgiveness , it will be given . It 's all here in this little brochure that I have prepared . How about this watch you 're wearing ? If I was to ask for it , would it be given ? Or do I have to take it ? Can we go home now ? So , Tommy . You still think they 're gonna embrace you with open arms ? You murdered Lana , didn 't you ? You killed her and you framed Superboy for it . Everything I 've done , I 've done for you . Stay away from me . Uh , not so fast , Tommy . We have a deal . No , not anymore , we don 't . And I 'm gonna tell everyone what 's going on . Do you think they 're gonna believe you ? - Your word above mine ? - I 'll go to the police . Yes , of course , you 'll go to the police you 'll tell them that you 've driven the city crazy with this machine of yours . That you 're very sorry and it 'll never happen again . - Is that what you 'll do ? - Doesn 't matter . I won 't help you anymore . It 's over , Verrell . No , my friend , it 's not over , it 's the beginning . She 's alive ? Hello , Tommy . See I told you I was keeping her for you . How did you do it ? Well , I gave her this drug that stopped her heart and breathing long enough for me to get her out of the building . What 's the matter ? Didn 't you watch Mission Impossible ? That and the coroner is my new friend . He 's an expensive new friend , but .. ... he 's very worth it . However .. It is rather ironic , isn 't it ? That the person that would fell the mighty Superboy is the one person that loved him the most . Turning into a good Jackie Collins novel don 't you think ? I won 't be a part of this . Well , then I 'll have to fry your friend .. ... with a million volts . Choice is yours . Don 't . Attaboy ! [ man humming ] [ chuckling ] [ screaming ] Officer . Officer ! Officer ! What 's going on here ? [ screaming continues ] [ sighs ] Could you check the air conditioning ? It 's stuffy in here . What are you waiting for , armageddon ? I told you to check the air conditioning . [ people cheering ] [ laughing ] [ grunting ] ( man on TV ) 'In the news , the series that have broken out around the city continue today for the third straight day . 'Citizens have been advised to stay indoors 'until the situation can be sorted out . ' More news as it becomes available . And the angle cried out , " Babylon has fallen . Has fallen , that great city . " It 's working , Tommy . My dream is finally coming true . The slime of this city is being pointed out for the hypocrites that they really are right on the centennial , it 's perfect . You 're very enthusiastic about your work , aren 't you ? I bet you have your share of women friends . Being so strong and .. ... rich and all . I don 't suppose with all those women that you 'd have time for one more . Well , you do have the most alluring lips . I do . It 'll be a shame to have to staple them shut . [ hissing ] Nice try . What are we going to do ? I guess our only hope now is Superboy . [ indistinct chattering ] Look , Lana , I-I know what you must think of me . Oh , I don 't think so . I 've done some .. ... horrible things but , but I 'm sorry for them . - I 'm not like that anymore . - You think that 's enough ? You just say you 're sorry and it 's all better . Suddenly you 're a different person ? It doesn 't look that way . Excuse me . But I am different now . I mean , I am . Prove it . Get us the hell out of here . I mean , there 's gotta be someway to stop him . How is he doing it ? What is making everyone go so crazy ? [ door opens ] Working like a charm , Tommy . The ladies gardening club has taken over the city parks and they 're taking potshots at people walking through their begonias . I 've never had so much fun . But you know , I would like you to increase the output . - Could you do that for me ? - What are you talking about ? With much more , people will start killing each other . Well , then that 's bad . - Don 't make me do that . - Don 't make you do that . Well , I 'm gonna have to make you do that , Tommy . You 're a bad man . [ chuckling ] Would you like one of these babies , huh ? How about you ? Hm ? Now , you didn 't say please . Dr. Connelly . Superboy , you 're still here ? I thought you 'd have busted out hours ago . - What 's going on ? - I think it 's the food . This stuff they serve in this place it 's enough to drive anybody nuts . Why don 't you go get the warden ? Oh , no . The warden ? He was the first to go . And don 't you start treating me like your little messenger boy . - Oh , you owe me . - How 's that ? If it wasn 't for me little Tommy Puck wouldn 't be on death 's door right now . I thought about giving him the real antidote instead of the placebo . But I just couldn 't pass up the chance to experiment on him . Ironic , you know . - There 's really a cure ? - Of course . But I prefer it this way . The , the electric chair is so impersonal . - Don 't you think ? - You 've got to give him a cure . What ? You would save the life of your sworn enemy merely because he 's a person ? That 's right . Superboy ? Ha ha ha , super wimp . Super wimp . [ dramatic music ] Hey , where are you going ? To save a man 's life . While you 're out , could you get me a six-pack ? Uh , this doesn 't fit . I need a small Phillips head . Hm . It 's getting a little hot in here . Well , you are among friends . Why don 't you take a few layers off ? I was thinking maybe we go some place cooler ? I tried that already , remember ? Do I sense a change of heart ? Look , I 'm sorry about what I said the other day . I know what you want . You should have just told me upfront . Ah ! Ah , ah ! ( Adam ) 'Get up . ' Tommy , you 're gonna regret this . Now , go finish that ! [ screaming ] Excuse me . - Matt . - Oh , hi , Clark . What 's up ? - Are you okay ? - ' Oh , here you are . ' The two biggest kiss-ups in the place . Yes , Mr. Jackson , what can I do for you , Dennis ? Oh , just once , just once- - Never better . Why ? [ screaming ] ( Ernie ) 'Clark , is that you ? ' Ernie ? - Clark , where have you been ? - I 've been away for a while . What on earth 's happened ? It looks like everybody in town has lost its inhibitions . It 's almost like they 're drunk . - Except you , of course . - And you . Well , I miss out on a lot . A smile is free , give one away today . Just like those TV screens . I don 't miss TV much . Never anything on anyway . Clark , what happened ? That was it , Ernie . It was the TV screens . That 's what caused it . They were transmitting a subliminal message that created mental stress . Who did ? Adam Verrell . Clark ? Remember , things are never as bad as they seem- - [ explosion ] Life is good , you are good , we all are good . ( automated message ) Danger , danger , danger , danger . What 's that ? Well , it would appear that .. ... something is disabling your screens . - Or someone . - Hm . [ screaming ] Didn 't your mother ever tell you to respect other people 's property ? I have something , I think you 're gonna be interested in . Lana . Now , if you wanna see her alive then come to my basement downtown . Superboy , don 't do it . It 's a trap . Of course he knows it . But he 's gonna be there anyway . I mean he 's a superhero . [ chuckling ] I 'll see you soon . - Is it done , Tommy ? - Yeah , I guess it is . Good , good . - Be really careful with this . - Of course . Let 's give it a test run , shall we ? You 're right . It is done . Now it 's your turn , you simp . [ rumbling ] Superboy , get out of here . He 'll kill you . The heck with that ! He 'll kill us . He 's got us wired . With a zillion volts . Apparently , you 've been missing out on all the fun at Capitol City . - But not for long . - No ! What are you doing ? If I 'm dying then I want to be remembered for this last selfless act . You 're not dying , there 's a cure . There is ? So much for selfless acts . Well , now let 's see what a superhero without his inhibitions looks like . [ dramatic music ] - He 's going to kill us . - Superboy . Do it . Kill them ! Fooled you . You shouldn 't have messed with me . [ grunting ] [ Adam screaming ] Nobody calls me a simp . Hello . Hello . Somebody want to get us out of here ? [ laughing ] Oh , I bet you have your share of women friends being so strong . I knew you 'd come . Hey , Puck . Where you going ? I 'm going to get that cure , and then who knows .. I 'm a free man with a complete pardon . I want to be good , but there 's so much about human nature I just don 't understand , you know . There 's so much to learn . [ whispering ] Bye . Why do I get the feeling things have just taken a turn for the worse ? [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

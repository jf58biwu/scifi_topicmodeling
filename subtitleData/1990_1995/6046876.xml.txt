 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ music playing ] My client is innocent . This whole court procedure 's a joke . Objection ! Order . Order , please . Counsel , approach the bench . That 's enough . Mr. Sloan , I 'm not going to warn you again about making inflammatory statements . Your honor , the prosecutor has obviously mistaken my client for somebody else . I have a list of charges here that says otherwise . Robbery , assault , murder . How could my client have possibly done all that ? Just look at him . Your honor , the present condition of Mr. Sloan 's client is hardly relevant . He has a proven record . A record I might add of vicious , often brutal crimes . Not only is he capable of such offenses , he revels in them . We have testimony from cellmates . He often brags about his crimes and uses them to threaten fellow inmates . Oxygen for Mr. Corbin . Does either of you have anything that resembles a witness or evidence ? Of course , I was just trying ... [ Judge ] Then let 's get to it . Your honor , the people would like to call their first witness . Bring in the first witness . The people call to the stand Superboy . [ crowd murmuring ] [ bailiff ] Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth . - I do . - You may be seated . You can sit there and you can honestly say that this man is dangerous ? Are you all right ? I don 't know . No ! Seems like old times . [ crowd gasping ] Hi , there . [ crowd clamoring ] Oh , man , it 's good to be back . You thought you got rid of me , huh , flyboy ? Maybe it 's time I returned the favor . Come on , the police will be here any minute . Next time . You know , these good people have been told lies about me . You 're lucky they don 't know the truth . Now let 's get out of here . The truth . [ laughs ] The truth is their hero isn 't who they think he is . Are you ? [ grunts ] I 'm the one you want . Let these people go . Let ' em go ? These people are here to see justice done , right ? That 's what I 'm gonna give ' em . Now there are two sides to every story , and I 'm gonna show you the other side of this one . So you settle in , folks . And you listen good , 'cause at the end , there 's gonna be a quiz . Which one of us is guilty ? Me or Superboy ? And who 's gonna pay the price ? I was just an ordinary guy when something very strange happened . [ tires screeching ] [ mutters ] [ shouts ] [ man ] I made it through the wreck . But it wasn 't too long before I wished I hadn 't . Wow . Where am I ? You are a very lucky man , Herr Metallo . Metallo ? What are you talking about ? My name is Corbin . Who the hell are you ? Oh , my God . Is that me ? [ cackling ] You like ? Oh , please , no need to thank me . You were badly hurt in the explosion . Your arms , your heart were destroyed . I only did what I had to do to save you . Save me ? You made me into a freak ? Look at me ! You 're still here . Another man might have been angry . Other men might have been hurt . Me . I tried to make the best of my misfortune . I used it to help track down criminals , one of who is in this very courtroom . Isn 't that right , pal ? - [ alarm ringing ] - [ shouting ] [ wind howls ] Metallo ! [ shouting ] That 's my name . Don 't wear it out . I tried to help , but I was betrayed . That takes care of that pain in the butt . Ow ! Wow . It 's sad but true . My whole life has been one betrayal after another . You know , I 've been thinking . Yeah , right . You and I ? A little luck , we could be running this country in one month . Yeah ? Yeah , and I got the perfect plan . [ Metallo ] I know now that it was wrong , but someone like Superboy comes and asks someone like me to help him , well , it can be confusing . How could I not say yes ? Now this began what I thought was gonna be a long and mutually beneficial relationship . [ laughing ] Oh , no , allow me . No , allow me . Let 's do it together . - [ electricity crackling ] - [ wincing ] [ alarm blaring ] [ sighs ] After you , pal . - Thank you , pal . - Hey , don 't mention it . Anything for a friend . But apparently , since I was the only one who could be a threat to him , he decided to get rid of me . Is this what it appears to be ? It is . It 's another chunk of the magic rock . Now I 'll be twice as strong . Or twice as dead . What do you mean ? I 'm turning your Kryptonite red . I was gonna double-cross you . But you double-crossed me . It 's a double double-cross . You think I 'd ever team up with a loser like you ? [ laughing ] Once you 're out of the way , nothing can stand in my way . Nothing . He tricked me into a life of crime and then he tried to kill me . That 's not true . Not true ? Which part ? Remember you 're under oath and Superboy cannot lie anyway . So you tell me yes or no . Did it all happen the way I just said ? - Well ... - What 's with the " well , well , well ? " Come on , speak . I 've seen Perry Mason . It 's either yes or no . - Yes . - [ murmuring ] Ladies and gentlemen , do we need to go any further ? I think the verdict is obvious . Allow me to pass sentence right now . So long , pal . It 's been fun . [ laughing ] [ Metallo laughing ] Wait . Wait ? Why ? Isn 't he allowed to have someone defend him ? I don 't know . Is he ? Damn . OK , whatever . Go ahead . Come on , come on , come on . I wanna do what 's right . That 's the kind of guy I am . Go ahead . Defend him . - Me ? - Mm-hmm . Well ... seems to me like he 's twisted the facts in his favor . The truth is a little different . You 're a very lucky man , Mr. Corbin . If not for Superboy , you wouldn 't be here today . Oh , yeah , I guess you 're right , Doc . If not for him , I 'd be out free just spending the First National 's dough and living like there was no tomorrow . There would have been no tomorrow for you , Mr. Corbin . Look , you suffered a massive heart attack . You wouldn 't have lasted the night . Look on the bright side , they 'll keep you off your feet in prison . You 'll get plenty of rest and with a little bit of luck , you just might live . Oh , yeah , sure , if I 'd be alive , I 'd be in a cage for the rest of my life , but fact it , Doc . I might as well be dead . Please , Mr. Corbin . " Please . " No one 's ever been that polite to me . I wish I could return the favor . But I 'm not that kind of guy . Yeah . I 'm a lucky guy . Yeah , well , so I had the occasional weak moment . What 's your point ? You talk about how your life has been one betrayal after another . Truth is you betrayed everyone that 's ever tried to help you . Even that man that gave you your life back . Well , Superboy , you 're expected at City Hall tonight . How do you feel about the big award ? I 'm really honored the city has chosen me to be the first to receive the community service award . Thank you , Superboy . - What 's wrong ? - Am I strong enough ? - Can I beat him ? - Who ? The one who started this . Superboy . - I don 't know . - There 's no time . He 'll be at the arena soon . Oh , well , I already died once . I 'll take my chances . [ bones crack ] All right . Most people would have been grateful to be alive . His concern was whether he could kill Superboy . Just curious . Curious ? Hey , whatever . What about all the stuff that Superboy did ? I am getting to that . You wanted justice , right ? More than anything . Nobody could have foreseen the effects that red Kryptonite had on Superboy . Power . It was unpredictable . Thank you for your efforts . - Think nothing of it , Super ... - [ bones crack ] [ screams ] Whoa ! I guess I don 't know my own strength . Superboy , what 's wrong ? Nothing 's wrong . What are you doing ? What I should have been doing all along . Letting the world know who 's in charge . It 's exactly like I said . Even she admits it . It wasn 't his fault . He wasn 't in his right mind . What am I , the picture of mental health . So far , I don 't think I see a single difference between him and me . There 's a difference , all right . One you carefully ignored . Do you think I could ever team up with a loser like you ? Once you 're out of the way , nothing can stand in my way . Nothing ! Superboy , don 't . We can help you . No , we can 't . Do it . Kill him . What are you , a coward ? Don 't back down now , Superboy . Just one punch and he 's finished . Kill him . I can 't . I goaded him to make him realize he couldn 't kill . That is the difference between you and Superboy . He can 't kill . It 's not in him . All right , shut up . You 've had your say . Now it 's my turn . Look , I know this is very unusual . The guns and stuff , I mean , but it 's very important to me that you people see my side and realize that I 'm not really a bad guy . I just been led astray by people like her and Superboy . Now you see , someone like me probably shouldn 't expect good people like you to understand , but I 'm hoping that you can look past this rough tin man-like exterior and see that I 'm just a regular Joe , who wants a little justice . So ... what 's it gonna be , huh ? Am I guilty or is Superboy ? Am I gonna pay the price or is he ? What 's it gonna be , grandma ? Stop it ! Please , do what he wants . Don 't put yourselves in danger . See , he 's practically admitting he 's guilty . Hey , how tough can this be ? Are you gonna let Superboy die to save yourselves ? Are you ? Remember the time he put out that fire in the rest home ? Remember ? Or that time he stopped that building from collapsing ? Or when he saved those kids in the school bus ? Or how about the last time he fought Metallo ? He could have been killed . But he did it anyway . He sacrificed himself for us . And now he needs us . But it 's not about that . It 's more than that . It 's about principles . The principles that he 's always fought for . And the principles we 're supposed to believe in . The principles that this very courtroom was built to uphold . Let 's go , Metallo . You proved your point . My point ain 't proved till I get a verdict . Go on , get out of here . I don 't need you . I don 't need anybody . I 'm Metallo . Yeah , he 's Metallo all right . But he can be stopped . Not by any one of us , but by all of us . All right , that 's enough . All right , you know your choices . What 's it gonna be ? Who 's the guilty one ? Him or me ? You .. What ? Yes , you . Huh ? You 're guilty . It 's you . [ shouting ] You bad boy . You should be ashamed of yourself . Hurting all these people , you don 't have any respect for anyone . You should be put in jail . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Are you people nuts or what ? [ wincing ] Oh ! The only reason he won because juries are suckers for a pretty face . Here , will you take that away ? Thank you . Thanks for coming to my rescue , counselor . I figured I owed you one . Or two .

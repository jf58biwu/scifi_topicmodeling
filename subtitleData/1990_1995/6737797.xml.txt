 # FIREHEAD # # THE SOVIET UNION REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA # # 1988 # Are you ready , Ivan ? Ready , Commander . We are approaching the area . Blow up the building . What are you waiting for ? Detonate ! What are you waiting for ? I said , Detonate ! What are you waiting for ? Detonate ! Detonate ! We want our freedom ! Where are you going , Comrade ? I am going to find a free country . - But this is your country . No . Not like this . I must go now . # N.I.H RESEARCH CENTER # But that was two years ago , when Ivan defected from the Russians . Yes , well , he 's sprung loose again . - I can 't believe that . He 's supposed to be our big hero . - Well , you better believe THIS . His powers have more than considerably increased since YOU worked with him . In fact he 's become dangerous . What do you mean ? - You 'll be briefed later . What are you talking about ? - We would like you to help us find him . Ivan is not my responsibility any more . Not since YOU kicked me out of YOUR department . Now look here , Warren , for god 's sake , that man is out there now , blowing up things Westec Chemical for instance . Wait a minute . I thought that was supposed to be an accident . Oh , Hart , we 're not going to tell the whole damn world about it are we ? Oh , for god 's sakes . Look , I could have you transferred back to my section if that 's what you want . But I thought , as he was a friend of yours , you might want to help him . Ivan is obviously disturbed . He could get hurt . What the hell are you doing ? It 's Russian Black Tea . Want some ? Alright ! So what if I do decide to help ? What then ? Good boy . # DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SPECIAL OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS # I 've paired you with Agent Buchanan of Special Operations . Look now , Colonel , I really don 't need any of your military watchdogs breathing ' down my neck . There 's a nice party on seven , CD . Now , quite seriously , Warren . Agent Buchanan was involved in this damn project long before Ivan defected . Now that should be helpful to you . I think it 's a bad idea pairing up a military officer with a scientist on a mission like this . Colonel Vaughn . How are you ? Well , you must be Warren Hart . I thought you 'd be older . Hi , Maila Buchanan Nice to meet you . I think it 's a great idea paring up a military officer with a scientist on a mission like this . What 's that stuff for ? We might need it to protect ourselves . - To protect ourselves ? It 's our orders . Ivan is unpredictable . I thought we were just supposed to talk to him . Yeah , but suppose he doesn 't want to listen . You know , your friend 's gone a little nuts . He 's been blowin ' up factories all over the place . They nicknamed him " Firehead " . But I don 't understand . Why would he do this ? What exactly were you working on before he cracked ? You 're pretty handy with that thing must take a lot of field experience . Hey , now , now , now . I don 't know what to do with this thing now . Take it back . When you need to use it , you 'll figure it out . When you need to use it , then you 'll figure it out . It was terrible , just terrible . I tell ya , they heard the blast clear over in Richmond . Thats about twenty , twenty two miles from here . Thats incredible . Was anyone injured ? No , thank God . It happened in the middle of the night . Two security guards were there , but ... - The destruction was almost total . He knocked out the entire storage facility in every laboratory . And you should have seen the bombs . Bombs ? What bombs ? The bombs they were building . I saw ' em . They were big as hog 's dicks on Sunday . Sorry , Ma 'am . Was this another one of Fulbright 's " pet projects " ? I don 't know . - You don 't know . Holy , what the hell is this ? Jesus Look at this ? Were there any explosives found ? None . No Sir , no residue . It IS odd . But this wasn 't caused by any normal explosion . This thing looks like a fusion reaction . That should have taken the whole neighborhood . Could you get your guys to bring some equipment over ? We 've got to run some tests . Thanks . - Yes , Ma 'am . Tell me what you 're not telling me . Tell me how Ivan could do this ? You know Ivan has telekinesis . They 've worked with him so he can actually move molecules . What ? You 're telling me he can mentally squeeze molecules ? What ? Fusion , like a nuclear reaction ? He hasn 't perfected it . He 's not THAT good yet . But , if he developed that ability , he could . He could destroy the world . So what else do you know ? Like , why would Ivan go nuts like this ? Like , why the hell won 't you tell me what you 've been working on ? That 's a nasty piece of work , Ma 'am . Thank you , Officer . - You 're welcome Ma 'am . So , where is your Russian " Doom Machine " going to strike next , Vaughn ? I thought we might try to stop him before he decides to act again . Listen , we entered into this arrangement ... - Together . Yes . And we 're together now . Ad orderum postum . - The Upper Order . Well , Westec 's gone . Charlie 's plant is destroyed . And together we 'll share our losses . Destruction of these facilities actually fits quite nicely into our original plan . Unless we 're completely wiped out first . That 's being taken care of . - By a research scientist ? What can he do ? All he has to do is find him . - And then what ? That 's been taken care of . Looking for lost souls , old man ? Me , too . Hello ? - Mister Simon , there 's a breach at your factory . Shit . I 'll be right there . Taggart ? - What 's this pansy doing here ? Well , hey , Taggart gosh , my rod 's bigger than yours . Is he inside ? Tell them to stop firing ! Goddammit , you 're gonna kill him ! Thats the idea , Pretty Boy . Asshole ! Now , now , now , you gotta stop them ! Ivan is too important to lose . Don 't worry , they can 't touch him . The fucker 's hiding inside of that thing . Well take cover and blow the piss out of it ! Taggart Taggart ! Can I point out to you that blowing up that shack would set fire to the whole place ? Ah , they got insurance . - What about the old watchman ? There 's no trace of him . How do you expect me to make contact with Ivan when you and this Bozo here to shoot him down ? - This was plain sloppy . Sloppy ? Did you see the way I blew him up , did you see those flames ? That was clean , Babe . Clean as a wolf 's tooth . " Clean as a wolf 's tooth " , Taggart ? Come on , who are you , Marlin Perkins ? Didn 't you notice we didn 't catch him ? Taggart , try not to be such a moron . Now why dont you all just shut up ? I asked Taggart to sterilize the scene if he couldn 't find him . And you 're right , Warren , firing on him was particularly stupid . Hey look , it 's the old guy from the plant . I seen him up close . He was big , really big . And mean , too . And those red eyes I didn 't see no red eyes . Damn it , Ivan 's not ready for prime time . Look here , Warren . You simply must establish personal contact with him . There 's no other way We 'e assembled some background information on Ivan . I suggest you go through this and try and figure out where he might be hiding . Yeah , yeah what are those things behind the newsperson ? What are those , tiles or something ? Oh , who cares ? Come on , Hart . Let 's go . I 've seen those tiles before . What tiles ? Now get the police to beef up security at these locations . My God , you know where he 's going to strike . How did you ... Look , Taggart , you follow orders , you get your pension . Now piss off . Hi , Smith . Thanks for knocking . - Look , Warren . I need help . Yeah . So do I. - Seriously , listen . I 've got the Aldehyde reaction going , but when I add the potassium catalyst , nothing happens . Doesn 't your mother ever need attention ? Your Aldehyde solution is not hot enough . It needs to be 160 degrees . Thanks . What are you drawing ? - Oh , I don 't know It looks like the heat shield tiles for the MX . What do you mean , " MX " ? You mean like in the MX missile ? Yeah . They 're made out of graphite and they 've shaped funny like that to fit the exhaust vent . I saw it when we toured the Vandenberg Air Force base . Thats where Johnny Bromeyer tried to kiss me but I told him . Thats it . Thats the link ! Every place he 's blown up has had some military connection ! Johnny never blew up anything ! Not Johnny , Ivan . - I don 't know anybody named Ivan . Yes , but I DO . Will syou shut up a second ? You seem kinda stressed . Is everything okay at work ? No , everything 's not okay at work . It hasn 't been okay in a couple of years . But you used to have fun there . In the old days , when Pendleton was in charge . Pendelton . Pendleton was always straight forward . He 'd tell ya if he knew something . You need to lighten up . You wanna play a game of laser maze ? No you don 't . - You sweet thing . Hart ? By God , it IS you . How are ya ? You 're looking good , Pendleton . - Good to see you . Something 's wrong , huh ? Come on . So your man Ivan is hitting military contractors , huh ? Yeah , but not obvious ones . Thanks ! Admiral . Everybody knows that Westec makes fertilizer , but practically nobody knows they also make one of the essential chemicals for solid rocket propellant . It 's the same with Simoris graphite . How did Ivan find out they make the MX heat shield tiles ? It doesn 't make sense if Ivan IS a Russian spy , then he 'd wanna be quiet . Yeah ? - And if he WASNT gonna be quiet , why didn 't he blow up something major like Lockheed or Hughes . Because Ivan is not a spy . He wouldn 't do any of those things I know the guy . Vaughn is not telling me something . I 'm sure that Ivan 's activities are linked with what they 're working on . Vaughn can 't even stand the man . - What do you know about him ? He was always a sneaky little bastard , he and his old boy clique of perverts . He 'd trade the Statue of Liberty for a couple of missiles if he knew he could set them off . Well , what the hell does the Secretary of Defense think about him ? Fulbright ? - Yeah ! Secretary Fulbright is the one who put him in charge . But , if you ask me , it 's Vaughn who 's calling the shots . Pendleton , I gotta find out what Vaughn is working on . I 'm sure that Ivan found out . Hart go back to your germs . Youv 'e a lot safer there . Oh what about Ivan ? It sounds as if Ivan can take care of himself . Damn it , Pendleton ! Admiral , I 've got to get to the bottom of this thing . How ? Vaughn 's not gonna tell you anything . - Of course not . But everything I need to know must be in the computer files at Special Operations . But you can 't get in there . No . But you can . Oh , shit I ain 't cut out for this . Son of a bitch ! Hey , come out here , butthead ! Your mother 's on fire out in the hall . - What ? I said , your mother 's on fire . Out in the hall . - What ? Big mess . I said , your mother 's on fire . Big mess . Out in the hall . Son of a bitch ! Oh , Jesus Christ ! What are you doing ? Following me around ? What , are you gonna go report back to Vaughn ? That 's fine , cause I have a couple of questions I 'd like to ask him ! Hey , give me some credit , alright ? I 'm not going to report anything to Vaughn . Im supposed to be your partner , remember ? Oh yeah , thats right . You 're my partner . Well , then , maybe you could tell me what this is ? - What is that ? Oh , come on . I took the names of the three companies that Ivan hit , fed them into the computer and guess what ? They all have brand new defense contracts signed by Secretary Fulbright . Well , there must be a hundred companies with new contracts . A hundred and five to be exact . Imagine that I asked Mister Computer to run those companies , see if any of them had anything in common . And ? - You tell me . You 're Special Operations . Westec Chemicals - access denied , Special Operations . Simoris Graphite - access denied , Special Operations . DeVries Industries - access denied . Access denied , access denied . eight companies in all ! So what the hell you you people on ? What , are you going to blow up the world ? Is that what Ivan found out ? I don 't know . - You don 't know ? Well maybe I 'll ask Vaughn myself . I have top secret clearance . I know the access codes . Come on . All those companies with the same five people on the board of directors . And Vaughn is one of them . The Upper Order ? What the hell is that ? There was an investigation about two years ago . I think it was the C.I.A. Well , can you access the C.I.A. computer ? Oh , my God , oh , my God , I don 't believe this . Who 's this guy one of the Upper Order ? Where 'd you get all this stuff ? Indonesia , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain . Bahrain ? That sounds pretty exotic . What were you doing there ? Travelling with Vaughn . Special Operations business . Yeah . Jesus , Vaughn and that group of old farts and their " secret society " . Christ , they could be Neo-Nazis , or ... Well , they 'd have to be pretty powerful to stop an entire Grand Jury investigation and close down a C.I.A. operation . I don 't know , I don 't know , Maila . I always thought it was a joke , do you think there 's really such a thing as the Tri-lateral Commission ? I don 't think Vaughn 's that competent . Yeah , I guess you 're right . I still think I 'm in way over my head , though . In over your head ? You ? The guy who single-handedly pioneered high velocity magnetism at room temperature ? You know about that ? - Are you kidding ? I 've been a big fan of yours since your early work on superconductors . Come on ! - Believe it or not , physics and chemistry are hobbies of mine . - I didn 't know that ! You never really asked me anything about myself . Oh , you always look so tough . How is this ? That 'll help . How about this ? Yeah , we have to get drunk . 23 . , 29 . , or higher . What ? - What 's the date today ? The 30th . No it 's not ! It 's after midnight ! It 's the 31st ! Another prime number ! I gotta go ! Hart ? Hart ? Hart ? # VANGUARD AIRCRAFT NO TRESPASSING # You missed the last flight to Cleveland , pal . Better get your hands up . Geez ! You startled me ! I was lost ... Give it up ! If you don 't have any I.D. , you 're dead . Alright , take it easy . It 's in my pocket . Take it out . Slow like . Special Operations . Sorry , Admiral . Oh ! Sonofabitch ! Oh , I hate it when I do that ! Shit ! Having trouble old friend ? Nah . Come with me ! Jesus Christ ! What is it ? A pianist . It 's a new bomber , isn 't it ? It is , isn 't it ? It 's Vaughn 's new toy ! It 's connected with that Upper Order , or whatever isn 't it ? Oh , come on. tell me . You 're one of the good guys , aren 't ya ? Jesus Christ . Ten seconds . Wait a minute ! Do you know how to fly this thing ? You want to stay here ? Take care of them . Wait a minute , I 'm not a demolitions expert ! - Push the detonator , toss , and go boom ! Now you are a demolitions expert . Hart ? No , babe Schwarzenegger . Taggart ? How did you get in here ? The Discover Card . Beats the pants off of American Express . How 'd you expect Hart to get in ? The Ruskie bastard just hit Vanguard Airfield , and Vaughn wants you and Hart over there stat . Could you wait in the kitchen while I put something else on ? Hart wasn 't in his apartment . Do you know where he is ? Then Vaughn gave me the assignment take out the N.I.H. Research facility at Parker Center . What ? Jesus Christ , that 's where I work ! I would 've been killed ! Thanks , buddy . Not to belittle you , but I was thinking more of the thousands who would die if the biologicals were released into the air . Yeah ? Well , them , too . Christ , I knew Vaughn was a maniac , but why would he do this ? I was to make it look like Russian sabotage . Sabotage ? Oh , shit . Oh , I get it . With a Russian threat , Vaughn could get any arms appropriations passed he wanted ! You do not understand what the Upper Order stands for . It 's not about money . Its about controlling the world . They want an all-out war . Jesus Christ . So tell me , friend , how are you involved in all this ? Ivan , what the hell are you doing ? I 'm on your side for god sakes ! What do ya think ? I mean , they just , they just want me , wanted me to find you and talk to you . Ivan , for God 's sakes ! I showed up at the airstrip alone , didn 't I ? Come on , I 'm just trying to help ya ! I always thought that I could trust you . And you were in a bit of trouble at the airfield . I just had to make sure . But what I do not understand is why you are so close to their assassin . Assassin ? What the hell are you talking about ? That girl . - Maila ? She 's one of Special Operations top assassins . Her job is to kill me . Oh , my God . I don 't believe it . She was so convincing . She was so good . Women . - So what the hell do we do now ? Don 't worry . I 'm going to finish them one-by-one . I expected you sooner . Tell Vaughn that life , as men have lived it , can only be Oh , fuck it . Just tell him he 's a horse 's ass . Where the hell is Hart ? - I don 't know . He disappeared . When did you last see him ? - Last night . That was one of a kind . You think he 's capable of finding Ivan ? Don 't ask me , you hired him . Buchanan , who 's side are you on , anyway ? I 'm just a government employee , following orders . Well , you follow this one - find him , before he does something really stupid . I know you can do it . You 're one of my favorite agents . I had millions in that bird . This is getting worse and worse ! No , it 's getting better . - You 're joking ! - I never joke . You 're crazy . - I 'm perfectly sane . He 's completely out of control now ! - Nothing is ever out of my control ! Don 't you see ? Are you all as idiotic as the vulgar throng we hold in contempt ? We had a plan to use Ivan to precipitate a world crisis . That plan was so sound that even the intervention of unseen hands actually came to our aid , Yes ! Your plant was destroyed , your plane , your factory . but who destroyed them ? A Russian . And that is the point . THAT is our plan . Then we can still destroy the N.I.H. Facility . And they 'll all believe that he did it , because we 'll MAKE ' em ! Our momentum continues . Vaughn ? Vaughn , where you hiding , damn it ? Vaughn ! Good to see you , Mister Secretary . - Likewise So , what do you need ? - It 's time . I figured as much . I read the papers . How do you want me to play it ? Well , Congress , as usual , won 't take to any increase in military spending , even though the suggestion comes from the Secretary of Defense . So we 're going to go for a groundswell of public sentiment . That ought to cinge your hairs and make ' em jump . A press conference for the media BEFORE I present it to Congress ? Yes . You 're gonna get to tell the people that there 's a real Russian spy loose in our midst . Scare the shit outta everybody . Then we 're gonna hit 'em with the big one . What big one ? - Let me worry about that , Mister Secretary . You just keep from boiling over back there in ' DC . Jesus , Vaughn ! Let 's just keep this one in perspective , okay ? Fulbright . You don 't wanna go back to being a farm fuck assemblyman in Indiana . Do ya ? Well no , not really . Then don 't fuck with me . It 's only a pack of cigarettes . Oh , God ! What are you , nuts hanging out here ? What is this , Siberian snake chowder ? America , land of the free . Where else can you have snakes for breakfast ? I never saw people go hungry until I came to this country . Yeah , we have Disneyland . Land of moose and squirrel . Thats Rocky and Bullwinkle , Ivan . Don 't tell me you 've changed your mind about this country too ? Oh , it 's not the country . It 's the spirit that counts . I miss the cold nights . I miss the people . I miss real vodka and real conversation . If you love Russia so much , why did you ever leave ? They wanted me to kill innocent civilians . I could not do that . That is immoral . And now Americans want me to do the same . Maybe all governments are evil . But I am a man of principle . Yeah , I got a few principles myself . A few of these snakes would be alright . I don 't know . Why don 't we just go to the authorities ? These men ARE the authorities . Yeah , but you don 't expect the two of us to take on the war machine , do ya ? I 've been practising . Jesus ! What 's the range ? What are the limits ? Jesus Christ ! Christ , Ivan you 're incredible ! No more you don 't know . In a couple of hours , my powers will return . But Ivan . Jesus Christ ! Ivan , for all anybody knows , you 're just some maniac out there blowing up stuff . And it just so happens that I have written records of these guys ' total activities ! The factories they own all the Upper Order bullshit , the works ! This is what we need ! Where is it ? - Back in Maila 's apartment . Oh shit , we gotta go . I thought you were bringing these to me . - Of course . Let 's go . Do we know the identity of this Russian spy ? Yes ! His name is Ivan Tigor . He arrived here two years ago under the cover of a defector seeking asylum . We believe he 's in the company of an American defector , Doctor Warren Hart . Could you give us more on the American Scientist ? Who is he ? Is he feeding the Russian any classified information ? We 're checking his files right now . I 'll give you more information as it becomes available . Mister Secretary ! Mister Secretary , Sir ! - Yes . Edward . What are you doing to protect our country , and what does this with regards to our relations with the Russians and Glasnost ? I have pressed Congress for years to increase our military funding . I can only hope , and pray to God that they recognize the severity of this situation , and respond now . I will advise the President to cease diplomatic ties with the Russians . Are you out of your mind ? Where do you come off with this " Russian Spy " business ? What are you trying to do , start World War III ? But Mister President , the evidence is clear . He 's been blowing up our military installations . He 's been killing Now , cut the crap , Fulbright . This isn 't Lafayette , Indiana . This is Washington , D.C. ! We 've got the world to think about . Now , I just signed a new trade agreement with the Russians . As a matter of fact , me and the first lady are planning a trip to Moscow next month . Now , how 's that going to look ? Us walking down Red Square , and you 're down here playing war games ? But what am I supposed to do , Sir ? - Just catch the damn bastard and eliminate him . I 'll pick up the red phone and smooth things over . I 'll tell them we were misinformed . Ah , yes I thought we were in a hurry . Ivan , a man has got to eat . He needs protein . Come on , eat . You do not like my snakes . - Ivan , your snakes sucked . What you need is some good American food . Now put some ketchup on that and eat it . More gravy ? Hart . - I , just asked if you liked it . - Hart OH , shit ! I cannot talk to you now , Captain . The shields aren 't gonna last much longer ! Smith , will you knock it off ? Hart ? Hart , what ? What 's wrong ? I saw you on TV . You 're not really a Russian spy , are you ? Of course not ! Just listen to me . I 'm in big trouble and I need your help . Yes . Okay . That 's do-able , but you 're really gonna owe me for this one , Warren . Anything , kiddo . Now listen to me . I want you to be careful , and don 't let anybody see ya . There 's a lot of Romulans out there . Aye , aye , Captain ! Mom ! I 'm going out for a little bit ! Don 't bother me right now , sweetie . Your mother 's very busy . Okay , Mom ! Smith , I knew you could do it , honey ! Come here and give me a hug . Hi ! I 'm Smith ! You must be the Russian spy . Everybody 's talking about you two . Im Ivan Tigor , a friend . I 've never seen such a big Russian before . Now are you gonna tell me what 's REALLY happening ? I tell ya what , Smith . When this whole thing blows over , you can write the book . Honey honey , I don 't have time to explain why right now , but you can 't come with us . Here here 's twenty bucks . Take the cab home , okay ? What ? You 're going to leave a twelve-year-old girl all alone on a dark street at night ? Aren 't you worried about me ? Not in the slightest . Come on give me a hug . I 'm gonna take this money and go to Vegas ! No you 're not . You 're gonna go straight home . Now come here and give me a hug . Thanks , babe . Shit Taggart , is that you again ? Hart ? Hart . It all makes sense now . Let go . You don 't understand . You 're hurting me ! I understand that you 're an assassin and you lied to me ! - I didn 't lie ! Well , you didn 't exactly tell me everything ! - I didn 't know everything ! Well , what the hell do you know ? Who 's side are you on , anyway ? I could not find the computer printouts . - Shit ! - Vaughn took them ! Vaughn ? Taggart ? What the hell is this Special Operations Rest Stop ? No , dammit ! - Does Vaughn know how I got those printouts ? DOES VAUGHN KNOW HOW I GOT THOSE PRINTOUTS ? ! Hart ! He will kill you if you try again . SHIT ! Pendleton . We gotta get Pendleton to walk us right in there . I got enough evidence . I know he 'll help us . What about her ? She 'll come with us . Frank ? FRANK ? Oh , dammit , Ivan . Something 's wrong . Frank ! Oh , shit , Frank ! Hart It is a trap ! - Son-of-a-bitch ! Get these fuckers ! Shit ! Hart back door , keep your head down . Shit ! Son-of-a-bitch ! Shit Hart , look out ! Oh , Christ Christ , Ivan , it 'll be a miracle if we get out of here alive . Miracles happen . Yeah , but even if we do , all the evidence we have on Vaughn and his gang has been destroyed ! It 's just our word against theirs . Christ , the whole country 's against us . Every cop and his brother is out looking for us ! If we are going down , let 's take Vaughn with us . " Lets take Vaughn with us " ? Okay , lets go for it . What the hell do I have to live for , anyway ? Don 't be so dramatic . Almost done . Yes ? Yes , they DID show up . What ? Well , I will tell you what you could have done , you cretinous idiot . You could have burned down the whole damn field , that 's what you could have done ! Yes , find her ! What ? What happened ? They got away . - Oh , my God . I knew it ! I knew it ! It 's coming apart all around us . It 's fucking out of control ! I am so tired of hearing that from you . From everybody . NOTHING is out of my control . I have just spent the last tedious half hour with you erasing any and all evidence of our activities from the computer bank . It 's gone now . Poof , disappeared , history finito . All that 's left are two Russian spies on the loose , tearing out the heart of America 's defense . I told you . The President doesn 't want to hear that . He 's not going to advance that line . He 's already told the Russians we 've got the wrong information . I think it 's time we all pulled out of this , Vaughn . Let things cool down a little bit . Obviously our president is not aware how grave our danger is . I must talk to him . You know he doesn 't like you . This is the last thing I 'm going to ask you to do for me , George . I want to talk to the President . Arrange it . It will be a wonderful opportunity for us to show him our new biologicals . He 'll want to see those , won 't he ? I suppose so . - Fine . You will set up a secret private meeting at the N.I.H. Facilities at Parker Center the day after tomorrow . Can you at least manage that ? I want you there , too . Okay , okay ! Better start being careful , Ivan . It 's up around the next turn . Jesus Christ , that was Fulbright 's car . - Let 's go . Vaughn here . I 'm calling a special session at dawn . Inform the others . Okay , now what ? Ivan , Ivan , look . It 's Vaughn 's car . He 's here ! Let 's go get him ! No , no . We have to get past security . Let 's wait . We 'll have a better chance of getting him when he leaves . Ivan - No , no , no . For now , we rest . What ? What 's going on ? - I do not know . Christ . It looks like a Fortune 500 caravan . Well that 's Ellis Shaw . Oh , my God ! That 's Peter DeVries . Ivan . Thats the Upper Order . Gentlemen , the time of ascenscion is at hand . And you 're all going to help me prepare . This is it . We 'll never get another chance like this again . They 're all here . - Would we have to get in ? Yeah Christ . I 've seen you deflect bullets . I 've seen you blow up the whole side of a frigging cliff ! Come on , let 's go ! You are forgetting my powers are limited ! When I exhaust them , I have them no more . Ivan this is a one shot deal . We have the gate guards , we have the guards in the lobby. thats all . That is all ? Just get me up to Vaughn . After that , if you 're running on empty I 'll finish him . My friend , you have been incredible up to now . You have surprised me and I admire that . But this is Special Operations we are up against at their home base . You are just scientist . I 've had a lot of experience killing germs . Ivan , this is our best shot . Use some of that brain power of yours and blast us through this fence ! Let 's just climb this one . And when these charges detonate , from all locations simultaneously , the N.I.H. Facility will will be blown to pieces , releasing all those deadly germs which they 've been breeding there for years . Thousands of people will die , this will bring public outcry to our side , and eliminate our only remaining impediment . The President ? - The President . He and Fulbright will be conducting a tour of the Facilities at that time . Sublime , isn 't it ? This was never part of the plan , the President ? Assassination ! Oh , please ! You 've murdered thousands of innocent people just like that . and you 're worried about killing the President ? Vaughn , this is the most demented plan I 've ever had the pleasure to be a part of . Aren 't you worried about who will have to replace the President ? In time we 'll have to take care of that too , won 't we ? I won 't be a party to this . - Yes , but it 's my party . And I invited you , because you 're all petty , and larcenous and you 'll do exactly as I instruct . Don 't worry . YouVe safe in here . Let 's see what this is all about . Get us more help . They 're getting through . Vaughn , open the fucking door ! Bingo . Do you stuff , Ivan . I 'll cover your back . Oh , Jesus ! I guess you would call this your basic Mexican Stand-off Except for one thing , we 've got old Firehead here on our side . Do your stuff , Ivan . What the hell is that thing ? - That is a Parabolic Phase Shifter . It cancels out his power and sends it right back to him . I 've been working on it for some time . Ivan , Ivan , stop it ! That thing is gonna kill ya ! Ivan ! Yes , I 'd rate this trial run a major triumph . I suggest you drop your weapon , Hart . It 's out of bullets anyways . Set him down ! - A little pushy aren 't we . Make sure he has his I.D. card . Jesus - Good . Now give me the gun . You crazy son of a bitch . You see , when they dig through the rubble and find your bodies , it 'll look like Special Operations here made a valiant attempt to stop you and Ivan . They 'll probably give him a medal . Ivan was right , wasn 't he ? You 're gonna blow up the N.I.H. Facility , aren 't you ? Oh yes , dozens of charges planted all over the place . It will seem as you and your Russian friend were taking no chances . Hey , Vaughn . What about Ivan ? Is he still alive ? I hardly think that matters now , do you ? So you 're just gonna release all these biologicals into the atmosphere , huh ? That 's not the half of it . Yeah ? I only wish I had the time to share it with you . Oh my God . The President ? Oh , Jeez . So good of you to come down Sir , and give me a chance to show you what we 're doing down here . And I have some very , very good news for you . It better be good , Vaughn . I don 't have a lot of time . I should say not , Sir . - I mean , I have a press conference this afternoon where I have to diffuse all this Russian spy crap you 've drummed up here . Well , that 's what I want to talk to you about , Sir . It 's all been taken care of . We have him ! - What ? Where is he ? Mister Secretary ! Please . Ivan ? Ivan ! Vaughn ! Right in here , Sir . Please sit there . Be comfortable , please excuse me . The Department of defense presents " A Prelude To War " . Where you holding the Russian spy ? Let 's cut all this " coming attractions " business . Get to the main attraction ! I 'll go check on our prisoner while you Sir , enjoy this little demonstration . Vaughn ? Vaughn ? These startling images could become a reality in the very near future . The latest advances in bio-chemical warfare pose a great threat to our civilian population . Oh , Jesus Ivan come on , come on Ivan we 've gonna need you . Come on ! Please ! I 've come to help you ! They 've tried to disarm you . It 's deadly to the nervous system . I gave you an injection of neo-stigmine but it 'll only last for about an hour ! Look , I just got you loose ! They 're gonna blow this whole place up ! You 've got to help me stop it ! Where 's Hart ? Is he alright ? He 's somewhere in this building . I must find Hart . Wait. shouldn 't we diffuse this thing first ? Can you zap it ? I don 't know . It would set it off . Well , I 've seen enough of this twaddle . Let 's go . Ivan , you go find Hart . I 'll try to dismantle this in the meantime . Oh , shit . Hart ! - Ivan ! Ivan ! Ivan ! Jesus Christ ! It 's good to see you , man ! I thought the damn machine had killed you . Are you alright ? - For now . What do you mean , " for now " ? - First , we take care of this . Ivan , what do you mean " for now " ? What did those bastards do to you ? Injected my bloodstream with poison . If it is not replaced within a very few hours , I will die . Oh , my God . Or it will blow up right now ! God damn it ! Let 's go . In here ! Make sure the President is safe in here . I 'll go check outside . What the hell are you doing ? - She 's with us . - What ? She 's with us . - When we 're out of this mess , I 'll explain everything . There 's no need to explain anything . Listen , Hart , I came back here to save you and Ivan . What are you talking about ? - It 's true . Think about it . Right now we gotta go save the President before this building blows up . What do you mean the president , what are you talking about ? It 's part of Vaughn 's plan . Clever plan , isn 't it ? Those are the spies trying to escape ! Get them ! Kill them ! Ivan ! Jesus , Ivan , your hand ! Right here in my lab ! Stop ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! - I am not a Russian spy ! Look , I 'm a Special Operations agent . Vaughn has gone crazy . He 's setting off bombs throughout the building ! He 's trying to make it look like Ivan did it . They 're going to destroy the place ! - What ? Here ? In this building ? I knew that Vaughn was up to something big , but ... You better tell me what 's going on , Fulbright ! Well uh , well , Sir , let me clarify it 's all this I mean it 's true . It 's all true . It 's been his plan since the beginning . He 's gonna kill us all ! We gotta get outta here ! Sir , this is my lab . In each one of those canisters over there is an experimental virus that would wipe out the entire state of Montana . I suggest we take them , too . Well , come on , man . Let 's give them a hand . Do not worry . Close the door ! Stand guard . # NUCLEAR DEFENSE CIRCUTRY OPEN IN EVENT OF IMMINENT ATTACK # Shit ! Son-of-a-bitch ! It 's Vaughn ! He has activated the radiation defense shield ! What does that mean ? - What does it mean ? It means we ain 't going anywhere . We 're sealed in , there 's no way out . Well , I don 't want to just stand here and die , and Im sure nobody else does either . Now why doesn 't somebody do something ? Okay , alright . Look , Sir , take your men . Get up to the roof emergency exit . Take those biologicals with ya . Ivan come on , we gotta go after Vaughn . Hart , he can 't go . I 'll go . - Uh , alright . Give me a gun . - Give ' em your goddamn gun ! Come on ! Here . Alright , the way I see it , we got two options one , we find the detonator , or two , we find every bomb that Vaughn has hidden . Do we know where the bombs are ? - No . Do we know where the detonator is ? - No . Good , then we 've got all the cards . Look , while we 're at it , let 's try and find the radiation Defense Shield Activator . At least that way the other people might be able to get out of here , alright ? Right . NO , thats not gonna work ! We got the same system at the White House . Got stuck once , just like this . Shouldn 't these things be made to open up from the inside ? We should call for help , Sir . Get the fucking National Guard out here or something ! Ivan , what are you doing , get down ! Ivan ! Seventeen , sixteen . What is it ? - I 'm sorry , Mister President . They can 't get us out of here . Ivan ! Ivan ! - Twelve Carry Ivan over there I 'm going after Vaughn . Damn it , it 's locked ! - Eight What are you trying to do ? - Don 't worry I came prepared . Six Now that was clean , babe . Clean as a wolf 's tooth . Oh , Hello ! Do I get a seat down there ? Come on . Let 's take a little trip to the Carribean , Just you and me and a gross of beetles ? I dont think she bought it . You want me to read to you ? - What are you reading ? Batman . - I don 't want you to read to me . Whoosh ! Crumble ! Vrroom ! What is this word ? - Zap . Zap ? Zap ! - Hello , boys . - Hey ! What have you got ? - I 've got you ! Well , if she 's got him , I 've got you . What are you reading ? Batman ? He 's a wimp compared to you two . - Now hold on just a second , Smith ! You know that Batman has to do what he does every day of the week ? See that crazy Cossack over there on your right ? He and I are finished with this stuff for good . I would like to conclude this National Security Council meeting today with a prayer that this kind of dangerous and evil incident will never , never occur again .

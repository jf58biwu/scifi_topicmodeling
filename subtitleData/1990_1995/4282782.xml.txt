 Gentlemen , thank you for attending the meeting . Now , it can 't have escaped anyone 's attention that things have been getting rather strained here of late . Morale is on the floor . We 've lost all trace of Red Dwarf , tempers are strained , supplies are low . So , I 've decided , if you approve , to appoint myself morale officer and set myself the task of raising spirits and improving the atmosphere . Now , to kick off , we should all meet once a week to have a coffee or a beer , whatever 's your poison , and get any problems we may have off our chests . Any objections ? Well , as it 's week one , why don 't I start ? You know what it is about Lister that makes me want to puke ? That makes me want to stab him in both eyes with an ice pick ? Everything , that 's what . Especially his godawful , chirpy , gerbil-faced optimism . And as for the Cat , what an unbelievable git . And Kryten , if he doesn 't change pronto , I 'll attach jump leads to his nipple nuts and fry him like Cajun catfish . Well , that 's cleared the air . I know I certainly feel better . Thank you , gentlemen . See you at next week 's morale meeting . Marvellous . - Good meeting . - What 's eating him ? Well , I 'm no psychologist , but maybe the bleak emptiness of our hopeless predicament is getting to him . You can tell when he 's tense . He scrunches up cups . And we 're not talking styrofoam . We 're talking enamel . - He attacked me with that fridge . - What happened ? He wrenched it off the wall and tried to insert it . - What did you do to upset him ? - Nothing . I was just sitting there , plucking out my lengthier nostril hairs with tongs . - Extraordinary . It 's so unprovoked . - The guy 's so touchy . If I did that every time you 're being gross , you 'd have to go on a fridge-free diet . The problem is , every day 's the same old slog in deep space . - Take Christmas Day . What did we do ? - If you remember , we were attacked by that pan-dimensional liquid beast from the Mogidon Cluster . Maybe that wasn 't a great example . I 'm saying our lives are dull , repetitive . We never stop to smell the roses . We never celebrate anything . - We got nothing to celebrate with . - Not true , sir . There 's a whole case of that wine I brewed out of urine recyc , practically untouched . Call me pretentious , but , for me , good wine should not leave you with a moustache that you can only remove with turps . Autopilot alert . - Storm front ahead . - Too late to go round ! It 's on us . Stellar fog , tightly-packed particles from an exploded supernova . Scanners can only penetrate a few metres . - Slowing to minimum . - Absolute concentration till we 're through . - There could be anything out there . - Don 't worry . We 'll spot it . - Anyone hurt ? - My pride sure needs mouth-to-mouth . Mr Lister ! Sir ! - He 's out cold ! - All stop . Let 's get him upstairs . - How is he ? - Not good , sir . Better look away . - I know you hate the sight of blood . - It 's OK when it 's Lister 's . - Impossible ! - What ? Look ! Mr Lister is a droid ! - What ? ! - No doubt about it . He 's entirely mechanical . A 3000 series . Made in Taiwan . Look , he has a 24-hour call-out number . I 'm sorry , I 'm not buying this . Who 'd create him and why ? What 's his missión ? To rid the universe of chicken vindaloo ? If he wasn 't human , I 'd know by his scent . The X-rays confirm it . This is so strange . Mr Lister 's an icon of mine . Now I find he 's an earlier model . Technically , I outrank him . How come he looks so much more sophisticated than you ? Sir , having a head shaped like a freak formation of mashed potato doesn 't make me unsophisticated . Why does he look more human ? Humans have always found exact duplicates rather disturbing , sir . The 3000 series was notoriously unpopular . Most of them were recalled . A few slipped the net and made new lives . - Do you think he knows ? - Unlikely . He probably reprogrammed himself to escape detection . This 'll crack him up , devastate him . Who 's going to tell him ? I 'll write you into my will if it 's me . I suggest you let me , sirs . I 'll talk to him droid to droid . OK . We 'll try to get out of this damn fog . - What hit us ? - Something in the stellar fog , sir . It didn 't show up on the scans . Sir , do you remember your parents ? I was found under a pool table in a box . Hmm . Was anything written on that box ? Were the words " kit " or " paint before assembly " written on the side ? While you were under , we discovered something rather disturbing . It 's that tattoo , isn 't it ? I don 't really love Peterson . He just got me drunk . It 's not the tattoo , sir . There 's no breaking this gently . I 'm afraid , sir , you are not human . You 're a droid . - I 'm a what ? - You 're a mechanical , 3000 series . - Technically subordinate to me . - What does this all mean ? In broad terms , I get the front seat in the cockpit and you 're in charge of the laundry ! And I want to see creases ! Kryten , have a heart , man . I 'm in major stress-related shock here . Gobsmack overload . You 're a droid . You don 't have real emotions . It 's just synthi-shock . Now go about your duties . - Why are you being so heartless ? - I 'll tell you . You encouraged me to break my programming and ape human behaviour . But you 're no better than I ! But worst of all , for four long years , I had to hand-scrub the gussets of your longjohns ! Now , unless you want to be damned to Silicon Hell , bring refreshments up to the cockpit , pronto ! - What was the jolt ? - It 's a mystery . Nothing on the scanners . It was like an energy pocket . We 're out now . I 'll see if this phenomena is mentioned in our databases . Tea up ! Sorry I was so long . Let me see that tray , please . - Why ? - That 's , " Why , Mr Kryten , sir ? " You call those triangular sandwiches ? Did you use a set square ? I think not ! And the chocolate finger display is laughable . Don 't just pile them higgledy-piggledy . Make them into an attractive log cabin structure or something . This will not do . Return to the galley and start again . OK ... sir . This doesn 't feel right . Not right at all . What a charlatan . All these years ... - Any ideas yet ? - Wait . Here 's something . Reports of artificial stellar fogs which contain reality minefields . - Reality what ? - Bubbles or pockets of unreality , which when encountered create false realities designed to disorient and drive off looters . - From what ? - It 's a defence device fitted to test ships , which have prototype drives so awesome in power that they have to be safeguarded . We crashed through an unreality pocket ? Which created a false reality , making us believe Mr Lister was ... Oh , my . - You mean he 's not a ... ? - No . - Tea up , sirs . - Sir , I , er ... What do you think of the picket fence ? - I 'm not happy with it . I 'll do it again . - Sir , may I see your arm ? Smeg ! It looks normal , human ! Someone else tell him . I 've got gussets to scrub . I wondered if you felt like a nice cold beer , sir ? Oh , sir , how many times can I apologise ? I have offered to mince myself . What more can I do ? Don 't worry , I 'll think of something , probably involving a poker , a recharge socket and 4,000 volts of direct current . This fog 's getting worse . I say reverse out . I hate to agree with Laundry-Chute Nostrils , but he has a point . Scanners are out , and my smell range is practically zero . Starbug is small . We can make it through without hitting any more unreality bubbles . Someone 's gone to big trouble to keep spacecraft out . - Let 's find out why . - But how can we guarantee ... ? We hit one ! - That 's what I said . - Where 's the Cat ? - He 's gone ! - I 'm not gone ! I 'm here ! - They erased him from existence . - Then how come we remember him ? - Who ? - I don 't remember . Hey , buds , don 't do this to me ! You can 't forget me ! I don 't get this ! An unreality pocket , and everything 's normal ! What do you mean ? I 'm invisible ! It makes no sense . The three of us are here . The four of us ! There 's four of us ! Can 't you hear me ? Can 't you feel me ? We 're getting some buffeting ! Passing back into normal space . What are you doing ? ! - Can you see me ? - Of course I can . You all forgot who I was . It 's weird here . Let 's go . We just have to keep our heads . Boy ! This is worse than triple-strength catnip ! The pockets are getting denser . We 'll never ... make it . - I can 't take much more of this . - Just ignore it . It 's designed to make you feel disorientated . He 's right . Let 's just keep going . All ahead stop . We have to talk . Kryten , how far to the epicentre ? About another three days , sir . - OK , you win . Let 's get outta here . - Perhaps there is one possibility . That 's it . I 've installed a temporary stasis seal on both deep sleep units . In theory , time will be frozen , and neither reality nor unreality can penetrate . See you in three days . - Did we make it ? - We successfully penetrated the minefield . - We found the epicentre . - What was it protecting ? A derelict . According to the computer , it 's from the 28th century and capable of time travel ? ! - Crew ? - All dead . This was the maiden voyage . They contracted an influenza virus on an excursión to the 20th century . Before they died , they programmed the autopilot and generated the minefield to protect the machine from the wrong hands . Does this mean what I think it means ? We strip out the drive and ... Bingo ! We 've got ourselves a time machine ! Let 's see if the sucker works . Sirs , choose a year . Since we can 't guarantee this will work , I suggest we select a neutral time period . He 's got a point . Let 's go for somewhere nice and safe and dull . How about 1422 ? - How about 1421 ? - What 's the difference ? No difference . I just wanted it to look like I was paying attention . Load 1421 , Kryten . 1421 loaded , sir . August 17th . Engaging the time drive . - Hey , we did it ! - Indeed we did . All chronometers indicate this is August 16th in the year 1421 - just one day out . - Give us visual . - OK , punching it up . I don 't get it . We 're still where we were . Of course . We 're still in deep space , sir , only now it 's deep space in the 15th century . Isn 't it wonderful ? So we 're still three million years from Earth ? Well , yes . - Taking her back to the present . - Keyed in . Engaged . Forgive me if I 'm being thicker than the offspring of a village idiot and a TV weathergirl , but what exactly was the point of that exercise ? Fun though it was drinking in the heady medieval atmosphere of pre-Renaissance space , the drive is useless , yes ? For the moment , but should we ever acquire a faster-than-light drive , we will have the combination to travel anywhere , anywhen . - Picking up a craft . - He 's right . Here it comes . It 's a Jupiter Mining Corporation call sign . Some kind of transport vehicle . Colour green , life-forms four ... craft name " Starbug " ? Call me crazy , but that sounds weirdly familiar . It 's us , man . Us from the future . Hey , incoming SOS message ! - Don 't punch it up ! Close comms ! - Why ? That vessel almost certainly contains our future selves . Contact could be devastating . The human brain cannot cope with knowing its own future . Yeah , but obviously we 're in major trouble , otherwise we wouldn 't show up . No , Kryten 's right . It 's too dangerous . What if one of us is dead ? - Who could handle that ? - We all could if it was you . They 're trying again . We can 't just hang them out to dry ! Then suggest that I alone make contact . I can give them assistance , then erase my memory . Opening comms . Present Starbug calling future Starbug . We are ready to communicate . Well , how did it go ? Everything OK ? Mr Lister , sir ... I love you ! You know that , don 't you ? I 'd hate you to ... go anywhere not knowing that , sir . So what 's the SP ? Can you tell us anything ? A little , sir . They are our future selves from 15 years hence . What a senseless waste ! Does something happen to me ? All I can say is that their time drive is faulty . They can only travel forwards . They jumped to this period to copy some components from ours . So will I actually get to meet me ? My knees are jelly ! Nobody will be meeting anybody . You must be sealed in the upper deck . - So when are they coming ? - Immediately . I 'll serve your supper in the ops room . I thought I 'd whip up a curry with jam roly-poly and a jug of chilled margarita . - They 're all my favourites ! - I know ! I thought we were out of tequila ? I put a miniature bottle aside , sir , for ... no particular reason . And I thought since today had ... no special significance , it would be appropriate to ... - Just go , Kryten ! - Thank you , sir . His favourite bowl . His little cup . The tin opener he used to pick his ears clean with . - Everything OK ? - Oh , yep , yep . Those darn onions get you every time ! - What onions ? - Er , the onions I 'm about to peel . I get emotional about depriving onions of their skin . Don 't Nixon me , man ! Tell me the truth . I die , don 't I ? I don 't make it . I can only disclose that all four members of the crew will be boarding this vessel . - But I 'm not amongst them , right ? - One of them is Dave Lister . Now , excuse me . I 've already said too much . I 'm really confused now . So I survive ? I can say no more . Please , let us not squabble on this of all days . Careful with them chillies . There 'll be none left for tomorrow . Look , there 's nothing you can do . It 's fate . Am I dead or alive ? If I 'm dead , how can I come on-board ? - What are you doing ? - Hacking into the security cameras . I 'm rigging it up to the mediscan . When they board , I wanna see ' em . Docking complete . Opening airlock 4 . Gentlemen , welcome aboard . Ah , Mr Rimmer , sir . Come in , come in . Did we actually used to live like this ? What a godawful , depressing little hole . We 're used to the good things in life now , bud . - Are you really me ? ! - Will you look at him ? Did I really look that goofy ? What 's on your head ? I hope you have a quarantine license . We 're time travellers now , and our business involves going back in history . I have to look incognito . I can 't go around looking like I 've swapped heads with a damaged crash dummy . I think we 're overstepping the bounds of agreed conversation . Is , um ... ? Mr Lister , did you bring him ? Sir , you look terrific . I was expecting something much worse . Don 't worry about me , Kryts , I 'm fine . Absolutely dandy . Blow me ! You 've hardly changed at all . Had I not known about the accident , I 'd never have noticed . Yo ! We 're in . Oh , my God ! Look at Rimmer ! - I can 't have changed . I 'm a hologram . - Wrong . You 're two meals from being a sumo wrestler . - Let me see ! - Am I there ? - Oh , yes . - What do I look like ? I can 't actually see . The light is reflecting off the top of your head . What are you talking about ? You 're as bald as a plucked chicken ! - Let me see ! - Wait ! I want to see if I 'm there . I don 't seem to be there . It 's just you two , Kryten ... - Oh , my God ... - What ? What is it ? Ooooh , dear ! What ? Is he fat ? Far from it . He 's lost a bit of weight , actually . Actually , he 's lost a bit of everything . - What do I do to end up like that ? - That is tragic . That is the saddest thing I 've ever seen in my life . What happened to my butt ? Buddy , you could park a plane in that crease . So you 're fat and bald . That 's what happens when you get older . I 'm a brain in a jar ! Self , self , self , self , self ! - What 's going on ? - This is our only bottle of wine . We saved it for a special occasión . And what could be more special than this ? - To the future . - To the past . - This is poison , bud ! - Haven 't you anything better ? - We 're used to the best ! - We 're epicures . We travel through history enjoying the best time can offer . Dolphin sweetmeats , roast suckling elephant , baby seal hearts stuffed with dove pâté . Food fit for emperors ! We know the greatest figures in history - the Habsburgs , the Borgias ... Only last week , Louis XVI threw a banquet in our honour . The man is a complete delight - urbane , witty , charming ... He was a despot who lived in obscene luxury while the working classes starved . - We didn 't see any of that . - And his wife 's an absolute cutie . They 're our favourite hosts . If you don 't count the Hitlers . - The who ? ! - If you avoid politics , they 're a hoot . - You 're friends with the Hitlers ? ! - It 's just a social thing . We don 't talk about his work . We just have a few laughs and play mixed doubles with the Goerings . - I don 't believe what I 'm hearing ! - You have to understand , we travel throughout history . Naturally , we want to sample the best of everything . Unfortunately , the finest things tend to belong to people judged to be a bit dodgy . Hermann Goering is " a bit dodgy " ? ! What has become of you ? You 've abandoned your morals , been seduced by power and wealth . All you 're interested in is indulging your carnal desires . And have we got some stories about that ! I don 't recognise any of you . You 're just amoral self-serving scum , freeloading your way through history ! Good grief ! I can 't believe I was such a pompous prig . OK . That 's it . You 've got two minutes to get off this ship . I don 't know how we became you , but I sure won 't help you . But we need to examine your time drive 's mass compactor . - That 's one minute forty . - He 'd be killing himself . He won 't do it . - What have I got to lose ? I 'm in a jar . - Gentlemen , let 's go . But without the calibration data , we 'll be stranded . - Fifty seconds . - Let 's go ! You 'll change your mind when you 've thought it through . You 're destined to become us . In the end , you 'll help us . Twenty seconds . Into the airlock . It was a mistake to see the future . Our lives will be coloured by the fact that we end up becoming people we despise . Threat warning . They 've got a missile lock on us . - Our future selves are attacking us ! - They 're nuts ! - The gyroscope 's out ! - They 're trying to disable us ! - Another lock ! - Incoming message ! Gentlemen , we have no intention of being deprived of the luxury the time drive provides . Either give us access to the data we require or be blasted out of the sky . - But then you 'll cease to exist . - Better that than live like you , like rats trapped together , marooned in deep space . Your answer , 30 seconds . - What do we do ? - Have we any chance ? Their craft is greatly upgraded . We have no chance . - Then I say fight ! - Mr Rimmer ? ! - Better dead than smeg ! - Yes ! Cat ? Better dead than sofa-size butt . - Kryten ? - Better anything than that toupee ! - Shields up . Arming lasers . - Bringing her around . - Target acquired . - Locking on ... Firing ! - Direct hit ! - Starbug thrusters ! Nice shooting , sir ! - Bringing her round for desserts . - They 've got a lock ! I 'm going for the fuel tanks . Locked on ... Fire ! - Mr Lister ! - Is he OK ? - He 's dead , sir ! - The hull 's going . We 'll all be dead . Cat ! Dead . But there may be ... Kryten ? Kryten ? There may be a what ? A way out of this ? Speak , Kryten ! How can we change what 's happening ? # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

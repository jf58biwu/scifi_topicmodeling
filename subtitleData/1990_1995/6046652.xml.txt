 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ music playing ] [ animal howls ] [ rustling ] [ creature growling ] [ creature snarling ] [ static crackling ] Both of you , twice the supplies as others , look at Clark . His name almost never appears on the supply list . He 's very careful . He almost never ... - Excuse me , Mr. Jackson . - Clark ! I was just using you as an example of an organized and conscientious employee . In fact , these are supposed to go to the Bureau 's most improved employee , and that is you , Clark . Passes to Universal Studio Tour ? All right , so it 's not a bonus . The guy 's in public information had a couple left over . - Do you want ' em or not ? - Sure , thanks . I almost forgot , there 's a woman waiting in reception . - She seems a little upset . - I 'm not upset . I 'm intense . - What is it that 's making you intense , Miss ... - Riley . - Miss Riley . - A werewolf . Miss Riley , as you can see , we are in a meeting . These are cases . Poltergeists , singing bushes , apparitions of various kinds , and these are workers who think that little things staples and paper clips are little things . What I don 't need today is an imaginary werewolf . It 's not imaginary . I 've got proof on this tape . - [ Lana ] Were you hurt ? - [ Miss Riley ] No . [ Mr. Jackson ] Maybe because there wasn 't anything there . [ Miss Riley ] Yes , there was . It 's a werewolf . I know . I 've been tracking this thing for months , trying to get evidence for my book . Maybe you should have waited a couple of more months before you came in here . Excuse me , Mr. Jackson . I think I saw something . You 've got better eyes than I do . Maybe . All right , you think there 's something there ? You got it . - Well , I didn 't mean ... - No , no , no . You got it . You fill out the reports . You follow through on it . But don 't come to me when it turns out to be a poodle with distemper . Here are the clips you wanted . Whoa ! You seen Clark ? He 's up there . Same place he was yesterday and the day before and the day before that . Think he 's gonna ask her out ? The other way around is more like it . Why 's that ? Because Clark 's heart belongs to someone else . [ laughs ] I 'm beginning to think this Canaris guy isn 't your werewolf . Clark , it 's a process of elimination . Everywhere Canaris has been in the last six months , there 's been a killing or a sighting , and only on nights with a full moon . Could be coincidence . Canaris is an expert on the occult . Ghosts , vampires and werewolves . He 's totally obsessed . I know it 's him . If it is , our trail 's run cold . Maybe he 's using a different name . Why don 't we check the police records for reports of anything suspicious on the nights of the attack ? There must be hundreds of police reports . Clark , there 's a full moon tonight . He could kill again . Or pass on the curse . What curse ? By scratching someone . That 's what the legend says anyway . What else does it say ? Supposedly if the werewolf is killed , the curse is lifted from everyone it scratched . You 're thinking of killing it . Solid silver . You shouldn 't . Clark , it has to be done . Who knows how many people have been affected . Maybe this is just something that Superboy should handle . Except even he may be vulnerable to the curse . Six hotels and four apartments in two hours . This detective stuff is killing me . I feel like I 'm on Dragnet . Thanks for helping me , Clark . I know I 've been pushy . - Intense . - Intense . You 've been wonderful . Can I help you folks ? Yes , we 're looking for a Mr. Miller . He was arrested near here for drunk and disorderly conduct last month . Miller 's got an office here and he takes a drink every now and then . So what ? So a few weeks ago , he showed up here at dawn , with his clothes torn and mud all over his feet . So he takes a couple of drinks every now and then . I don 't think you should be taking alcoholism so lightly , if that 's what it is . Hey look , I don 't know what his problem is . But if you wanna find out , why don 't you ask him yourself ? That 's not Miller . That 's Canaris . This is the one he went in . What now ? Christina ? [ growling ] [ growling ] [ exhales ] [ werewolf howls ] [ growls ] Christina , where 've you been ? I was worried . Is it dead , the werewolf ? - Yeah . - Oh , God . Where 'd you go ? I was afraid . I ran away . And I couldn 't find you today . Don 't ask any more questions , OK ? He 's dead . That 's all that matters now . This is exactly what I 've been talking about . You used a paper clip when a staple would have been just as effective . A paper clip costs a tenth of a cent , but a staple only costs four ten-thousandths of a cent . Surely you can see that . Of course , what was I thinking ? The police found a derelict in an alley last night . His throat was torn out . By this alleged werewolf ? Same kind of wound , but it wasn 't the werewolf . At least not the one Superboy fought . - But why didn 't you call ? - Can 't we just forget about it ? - But I wanna know . - You know what I think ? I think you spend too much time in this place . You need to get out . Come on . You 're telling me that there were two werewolves out there ? Coroner says the derelict was killed two hours after Canaris died . Well , where did this other werewolf come from ? - And who is it ? - [ telephone rings ] Jackson here . Oh , thanks for getting back to me so quickly . Mm-hmm . I didn 't know that . Are you absolutely certain ? OK , thank you . Well ? That was my friend from the university . He knew Canaris and he asked me about Canaris' research assistant . - He had an assistant ? - For the past two years . And her name is Christina Riley . Why didn 't she tell us that ? She 's with Clark . Let 's ask her . Where 's Kent ? He just left with that girl he 's been working with . Clark , you 've been so great . And you trusted me right from the start . Just part of my job . You really trusted me . Well , you trusted me , too , didn 't you ? I do now . There 's something I should tell you . Never mind . No , what ? What is it ? Doesn 't matter anymore . Of course we checked his apartment . He 's driving a beat-up '68 Chevy truck . Green . Can 't you put out an APB or something ? It 's very important that he call his office immediately . Why else would she lie ? She 's hiding something . Like what ? Like she 's the other werewolf . - Come on . - No , no , it all fits . Remember when Clark said she disappeared at the office building ? That 's when she killed the homeless man . And the tape we saw . What about it ? The werewolf could have scratched her then . See , she used us to help her find Canaris for her . She was afraid if we knew the truth , we wouldn 't help her . She wanted to kill him to lift the curse from herself . It doesn 't matter anymore , right ? Isn 't the curse supposed to be over now that Canaris is dead ? Yeah , according to this book . But this one says nothing can end it , except death . So does this one and this one . Oh , and there 's something else . According to this one , " the werewolf tries to kill the one it loves . " Clark . And after that , I took my internship at the Bureau in Capital City . And here I am . I didn 't realize this was such a long drive . I must be boring you to death . I 'm sorry . No , not at all . OK , they put out an APB on his truck . If he 's in this city , they 'll find him . He could be anywhere by now . I know where they went . What are you doing with that ? I 'm not taking any chances . Go to the security office at the studio . I 'll meet you there as soon as I can . And hurry , Orlando 's a long way . [ knock on door ] We 're closed . No , you gotta let me in . It 's urgent . Government business . What does the government want with me ? I need something in silver . Are you OK ? You don 't look so good . Yeah , I 'm OK . It 's just that earthquake ride really shook me up . That 's the idea , Clark . Another full moon tonight . Really ? Sometimes there 's two in a row . Anything wrong ? No . Not anymore . Oh . Is everything OK ? I don 't feel so well . I 'll be right back . It doesn 't have to be pretty . Yeah , yeah , but it does have to work . [ werewolf growling ] [ women screaming ] Her name is Christina . I 'd appreciate it you could check on her . It is still warm . Thanks . Wait . Maybe you need one of these , too ? Some other time . But you don 't understand . Sure I do . There 's a werewolf running loose . It 's his job . He works here . Him and I go bowling on weekends . No , this is a real one . - [ growling ] - [ screaming ] Bowling , huh ? [ growling ] The werewolf . It 's Christina Riley . She came here with Clark ... Christina ? Stay here . Christina . Christina . [ growling ] Christina , it 's me Clark , remember ? Remember how I trusted you ? Now you have to trust me . You have to fight it . [ snarling ] [ gunshot ] [ crowd gasps ] There was no other way . [ music playing ]

 The name 's Brogan . Lieutenant Brogan . ( sirens wailing ) For 20 years , I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now ... Well , let 's just say , I 've " transferred " to another precinct . ( dramatic music playing ) Ah , nothin ' like a father-Son adventure . Doing what men have done since the dawn of TIME : Getting away from women ... heading off on their own . To see an asteroid ... how exciting . Dad , if I wanted to see a ball of ice , I could 've gone to the fridge . Look , Merlin 's asteroid only comes close to altor once every 20 years . Trust me . It 's really something up close . So you go into hoc to beef up the Hopper , so we can make the jump ? Well , what else is money for ? Uh , I don 't know . Maybe , someday , I could see some . Yeah . Well , try lookin ' at that . ( Brogan laughing ) Still wanna go back to the fridge ? All right ... Let 's head in for a closer look . ( electronic beeping ) Dad ? ( rattling ) Dad , what 's happening ? Uh , I don 't know . Try switching ' to Manual . You knew the Hopper was gonna go screwy . ( chuckles ) Well , the berkoff radiation surrounding the asteroid disrupts computer functions . You could warn a guy . ( chuckles ) What , spoil our fun ? Okay , let 's take a look at the side you can 't see from altor . Ah , smooth as space . Who needs an auto-Pilot ? I guess they did . Brogan on RADIO : Come in , unidentified ship . Repeat , do you copy ? I told you . It 's a wreck . Come on , dad , the bay doors are open . Let 's go take a look . I don 't think that 's such a hot idea , Matt . But we came all this way . It 'll be fun . ( exhales ) okay . All right ! Huh . ( beep ) Huh . What do ya know ? We got air . Okay , Matt , you stay here while I check this out . ( whines ) Dad ! ( softly ) Dad . Matt , we play by my rules , or we don 't play . ( soft clinking ) Hey ! Easy , dad ! ( sighs ) I thought I told you to stay put . I , um , I have some questions on those rules . Matt , get back to the Hopper . Throttle down , dad . This isn 't a crime scene . It 's just an old ship that 's been here , since the dawn of time . All right , but don 't touch anything . All right . Okay , what do we got here ? ( machine powering up ) man . We got enough stored energy here for a round trip to earth . Think your mother 'd mind ? Nah . ( chuckles ) ( screams ) Come on ! Come on ! You 're okay , you 're okay ! ( breathing heavily ) I 'll never disobey again , I promise . I promise ! ( chuckles ) Well , your mom 's gonna be glad to hear that . I mean , it 's not like I 've never seen a dead body before . I 've seen lots ... on tv . Ah . Don 't touch it ! It 's all right , Matt . He 's dead . He 's been dead a long time . Matt : So what do we do ? Well , I don 't know . I guess we oughta see if there 's any way we can fire up this ship and get it back to altor . All right , dad ! Taking off 's one thing . You think you can land it ? Well , that 's okay , Matt . As soon as we get out of this radiation field , we 'll call for assistance . Brogan over COMMUNICATOR : Uh , it looks like a homicide . Blaster burn on the chest . No sign of a gun anywhere . Can we id him ? ( sighs ) the face is pretty well decomposed . ( scoffs ) That 's an understatement . Yeah , the old ones are always a bear to solve . Yeah , well , hopefully we can pass this one on . Traffic 's sending out a pilot to meet us . They 'll probably roll it straight over to forensics . Hey , dad , get a load of this . H.I. ? Humes interspace . Well , what do ya know ? We 're on board a Humes interspace prototype number sk90 . Better give ' em a call ... see what they got to say . Yeah , you got it . Later . ( communicator disconnects ) Humes interspace . Maybe you should try calling Alden Humes himself . Oh , yeah , he takes a lot of calls from street cops . He hasn 't always been a recluse , you know . Once upon a time , he used to be a playboy jet-Setter , Darling of the tabloids . Totally irresistible to women ? Yeah , I guess we do have a lot in common . In your dreams , haldane . These specks look great . Tell the crew , " Good work , " and , uh , take them all out for a big dinner ... on me . Thank you , sir . ( phone ringing ) Hang on a minute . Yes , Linda ? There 's an officer haldane calling . He wants to speak with Mr. Humes . ( sighs ) Pipe him through . Hello , Officer , I 'm dag jomore , Mr. Humes ' right hand . What can I do for you ? We found one of your ships on Merlin 's asteroid . We thought somebody there might know something about it . ( laughs ) Really , Officer , do you have any idea how many ships Humes interspace has manufactured ? We supply every sentient race in the galaxy . Well , this is one of your prototypes , sk90 . Ah , Well , that is a different matter . Yes , we 'd have a record of that . I 'll look into it . You might want to look into one other thing . We found a body on board . Uh , I 'm , uh , I 'm not sure I follow what you 're saying , Officer . Was it one of our employees or something ? Well , it was one of your prototypes . We thought maybe somebody there could shed some light on it . Well ... naturally , I 'll help any way I can . Thanks . We 'll get back to you . ( electronic beep ) Incredible . Uh , should we inform Mr. Humes ? Well , he 's not gonna like it . Bad publicity for the company . I 'll tell him . Man , wouldn 't you love to see anansi 's face if I cruised by school in this baby ? Well , if nobody claims it after 60 days . ( electronic beeping ) ( stutters ) What 's that ? I don 't know . Some kind of signal comin ' in , but I can 't unscramble it . ( beeping stops ) Must have the wrong number . Automated female VOICE : Warning ! Warning ! This ship will auto-Destruct in T minus 60 seconds and counting ! 59 ... 58 ... 55 ... 54 ... 53 ... 52 ... computer , override ! Computer , override self-Destruct ! 51 ... 50 ... computer ! Matt , get to the Hopper ! Dad ... ( shouts ) do it ! 49 ... 48 ... 47 ... 46 ... the door won 't open ! Come here . Come here ! 44 ... 43 ... 42 ... 41 ... 40 ... go , go , go ! Come on , Matt , move it ! 36 ... 35 ... 34 ... 33 ... get back , Matt . Come here . 32 ... 31 ... 30 ... 29 ... 28 ... 27 ... 26 ... 25 ... Matt , get back ! 22 ... 21 ... 20 ... go , go ! 19 ... 18 ... 17 ... 16 ... go ! 15 ... 14 ... 13 ... 12 ... 11 ... 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... go , dad , go ! 3 ... it 's okay . We 're okay . No ship . No body . Great . Yeah , well , physical evidence tends to be overrated . Yeah , well , somebody didn 't think so . The signal that triggered the auto-Destruct was no accident . All right , recording . Now , Matt , I want you to remember everything . I just saw what my dad saw . I know , but I want to hear it in your own words . You ever been shot ? Once or twice . Let me see the scars . Um ... maybe later . First I have to make a report on everything you saw on that ship . You know , whoever did this , I 'm gonna nail him to the wall . Yeah , but first you gotta have a case . All right . All right , step one ... who knew you found the ship ? It had to be you , haldane . You never did like me . Don 't give me any ideas . And you say you clawed the body away when it fell on you ? Yeah , I was freaked . I had to get the horrid body off me . Brogan , we may have something . Matt , have you washed your hands since you touched that body ? No . I guess I should 've . Oh , no , you shouldn 't . Hold still , please . You must hold still . Matt told me he clawed at the dead man 's face . I 'm hoping that some of the dna 's still there . ( beeping ) Yes ! What does that mean ? It means that when you pushed him away , some of the skin from his face got under your nails . Whoever blew up the ship didn 't destroy all the evidence . ( groans ) you mean I 've been walkin ' around with pieces of a dead guy ? ( chuckles ) Every cell has a template of the entire body . We can run a dna sequence of the sample and get some idea of what the guy might have looked like . How long will that take ? About five or six hours ... say 9 : 00 , tonight . Okay , uh , I 'm gonna drop you off at home , pal , and , uh , you and I are gonna go visiting . 120th floor . Automated female VOICE : Good afternoon , gentlemen . I 'm your Humes interspace elevator . If you 'd like to have a conversation or listen to music , please state a selection . How ' bout silence ? Excellent choice , sir . Samuel Johnson said , " Silence propagates itself , " and the longer talk has been suspended , " the more difficult it is to find anything to say . " While George Elliot said , " Speech may be barren ... " ( sighs ) talked to death by an elevator . Next time , music . Officer haldane . And you are ? Brogan . Ah , yes . You were on the ship . Officer haldane told me what happened . Please , come this way . You were right . The sk90 was one of our ships , a prototype for deep space missions . It was launched 20 years ago . We were supposed to recover it soon after to study its data , but we lost its signal , assumed that it had gone off course , drifted out of the core systems . Who was the pilot ? It had none . It was on auto-Program . Did you tell anybody about the discovery ? Other than my assistant , no . I don 't think so . Did you tell your boss ? Oh , Mr. Humes ? Uh , yes , yes , I did . Then we 're gonna need to speak to him . Oh , no , not possible . He 's a very private man . ( gags ) Look , pal , whoever did this didn 't just try to kill me , they tried to kill my son . Now we can do this easy , or we can do it hard . I 'll ask if he 'll see you . Thank you . Well , I think you just blew any chance for employment at this company . ( keys beeping ) Mr. Humes . Whoever killed our John Doe most likely cut the ship 's signal so it 'd never be found , But they didn 't count on the asteroid to bring it back to altor . So why didn 't they just send an auto-Destruct signal 20 years ago ? Well , they probably did , But the berkoff radiation shut down the ship 's computer before the signal got through . Okay . Until Matt and I manually flew the sk90 out of the asteroid 's radiation field , it couldn 't see the code . Right . ( door opening ) Gentlemen . Lieutenant Brogan and officer haldane . This is a pleasure . Sorry , but I never shake hands . That way I avoid getting your germs and you mine . I believe it keeps old age at bay . Well , I 'm gonna have to give that a try . You look great for a guy pushing ' 60 . How long you been doin ' that ? You know , I ... I don 't remember . Uh , please , um , gentlemen , sit down . Jomore , refreshments . Uh , nothing for me . I 'm on duty . Humes : It 's just cave mountain water , lieutenant . It 's nothing intoxicating or poisonous . Oh , come now , gentlemen , we wouldn 't be having this conversation unless you suspected me of some terrible crime . But I was horrified to learn of the narrow escape you and your son had . For someone to try to destroy one 's family . I ... ( sighs loudly ) I always wanted a family , but ... somehow , I never had one . Seems as though it 's been nothing but business for years ... years . What would you like to know ? Did you send the signal to destroy the SK90 or order it to be sent ? Mr. Humes ! It 's all right , jomore . No . Did you kill the man onboard the ship ? I 've never killed anybody . Did you know who he was ? No . And I 'm sincerely sorry that all of your evidence was obliterated . Well , luckily for us , it wasn 't . Our forensics team has a dna sample that 's gonna give us a picture of the victim 's face within the next few hours . ( softly ) Wow ! That 's remarkable what science is capable of . Hmm . Isn 't it , jomore ? Oh , uh , yes , sir . Yes . Is there anything else ? No , that 'll do it , but we 'll get back to you if there is . Yes , of course . Any time , gentlemen . Jomore , show them to the elevator . We know the way . Now that we 've bated the hook , let 's get back to the station and see if we get a bite . ( rhythmic beeping ) Now , here 's what I want you to do . Matt on RECORDER : You ever been shot ? Jane : Once or twice . Matt : Let me see the scars . Jane : Um ... maybe later . What are you doing , haldane ? Uh , just thinking . ( recorder clicks off ) thinking ? I 'm shocked . You 're shocked ? Don 't be redundant . Seriously , castle . Earlier when you were talkin ' to Matt , questioning him , you mentioned bullet wounds ... was that one or two ? That 's none of your business ! You show me yours ... I can 't believe you met Alden Humes ! Orbital , dad ! What 'd he say ? He said he 'd like to have a family . Where do I go to sign up ? Hi . Hey . Are you hung up at work ? Yeah , something came up . Who would 've guessed ? Say , dad , think you could front me five credits for New slamball wheels ? I 'm a little short this month . It 's okay . I 'll just drag the gutters for loose change . ( chuckles ) ( laughs ) ( giggles ) We 've instilled some fine values in that boy . Yeah , well , he takes after his father , don 't you think ? Anyway , listen , I 'm on early shift tonight . Uh , Liz is at Charla 's , and , uh , you and Matt 'll just have to fend for yourselves . No problem . Okay . ( line disconnects ) ( rhythmic beeping ) ( alarm ringing ) Automated female VOICE : Alert ! Alert ! Fire in the medical room ! Alert ! Alert ! Fire in the medical room ! Over there ! ( coughing ) here ! ( clattering ) ( coughing ) Where 'd he go ? Where 'd who go ? Humes , he was right there ! Well , there 's nobody here now . And nobody could 've got past me . Well , then how 'd he get outta here ? Brogan : I 'm telling you what I saw . So we 're in there in breathers and this guy is ... standin ' there like he didn 't have to breathe . Do you know what you 're sayin ' ? Yeah , I know what it sounds like , but I know what I saw . Lieutenant , we 've managed to save the sample . We 're now ready to make a rendering of the victim 's face . Oh , boy , now I 'm startin ' to see it . Make it three . So if the body that was found on the ship was Alden Humes , who the hell did we meet this afternoon ? Like the man says , " It 's remarkable what science is capable of these days . " You work long hours , gentlemen . Seems you do , as well . You have a question for me ? Yeah . What 'd you have for breakfast ? Lieutenant Brogan , this is ridiculous ! It 's a simple question . What 'd ya have ? ( scoffs ) Well ... What 'd ya eat yesterday or the day before , or for the last 20 years ? It 's so odd , I ... ( stammering ) I can 't recall . What have you done over the last 20 years , except work ? Tell me about one friend , one conversation . Have you ever been to a slamball game , walked in the rain ? I simply can 't explain this . No , but I think I can . Jomore , what is the meaning of this ? Brogan : It means you 're a projection , a computer simulation of the real Alden Humes . No , no , it ... it can 't be True . You killed Humes all those years ago , then you hid his body on the spacecraft , but you didn 't count on the asteroid bringing ' it back to haunt you . Alden Humes is an eccentric . Everyone knows it . He programmed the simulation himself and is living a reclusive life on danai . That 's your story ? It 's as good as yours . ( softly ) I just ... I don 't understand what 's happening . Jomore , who am I ? You 're all that Alden Humes was and knew . Jomore needed that expertise to run the company , keep it on the cutting edge ... and do other errands . You don 't remember starting the fire in our medical room , do you ? No . Brogan : Jomore programmed you to do that and then , uploaded you into the station system . You 're nothing but his slave . Whatever the relationship between myself and my employer , I don 't have to listen to any more of this . I 'm asking you to leave . Let 's go , haldane . Oh , um ... once word gets out there 's no Humes , what do ya think 's gonna happen to this company 's stock ? See ya on the late show , boys . Well , that oughta make ' em sweat . Yeah , in the meantime , we make a case against them that sticks like a valerian blue dog . ( door opens ) Ground floor . Automated female VOICE : Good evening , gentlemen . I 'm your Humes interspace elevator . If you 'd like a ... music ! Certainly , sir . What would you like to hear ? How ' bout sweet mystery ? ( laughs ) You did what they said , jomore . Don 't deny it ... just tell me why . Alden , I think you need to rest . No , jomore ! ( exclaims ) ( remote clatters ) ( cries out ) You 've known me for years . I 'm a forgiving soul . Why ? You were running the business into the ground with your partying , your wild times . What was I supposed to do ? There were alternatives . You needed to be controlled . ( yells ) You didn 't have to kill me ! You turned me into this ! You tore me from my life ... from what I might 've had ! Ground floor ! Ground floor ! Automated FEMALE VOICE : Good evening . I 'm your Humes interspace elevator . Oh , shut up ! Humes : What would you like to hear , jomore ? How ' bout the funeral March ? Humes , we can work this out ! Yes , that 's just what I 'm doing . Oh , by the way , you 're fired ! No ! No ! No ! ( screams ) no ! I 'm free . ( laughs ) Free ! ( sirens wailing ) Guess the bottom sort of dropped out of jomore 's life . Maintenance says the elevator was serviced yesterday , but you don 't think this was just a malfunction ? No . Humes did this . Humes is dead . He 's been dead for 20 years . A computer program did this . I 've run diagnostics on every computer in this place . If there was a simulation of Alden Humes , he ain 't here now . Well , he 's on the loose , and we don 't know where . You had a break lately , Brogan ? I 'm okay . Go home , lieutenant . Get some rest . Matt ? We 're in here , dad . Hey , how ya doin ' ? lieutenant Brogan , I was just telling Matt how much I owed his father . He wants me to make a list of everything I 've ever wanted ! Orbital , eh , dad ? Go to the Hopper , Matt . Why ? Where are we going ? Do what I say . Go on , Matt . We 'll be seeing a lot of each other . Sometimes , you can be massively mental . ( chuckles ) Nice kid . How 'd you get here ? With the proper programming , I can appear anywhere . And , lieutenant , I can program anything . ( laughs ) Oh , let 's not talk of trifles . You liberated me , and I 'm grateful . All the things I 've ... I 've longed for , I can now have ... friends ... a family . I 'd like to be part of your family . You killed jomore , didn 't you ? No , no , he killed himself when he disposed of my organic Form 20 years ago . I merely dispensed justice , and that 's just the beginning . Oh , do ... do you have any enemies , lieutenant , some criminals you can 't convict ? 'cause I can seek them out , delete them . You 're gonna have to start with me . Oh , please , there 's no need for that . Anyway , we both know it would have no effect . I 'm as insubstantial as ... ( chuckles ) As a cloud . I 'm ... I 'm invulnerable . I 'm immortal . I 'm ... I 'm god . You 're not god ! You 're not even Alden Humes . You 're some out of control computer image . I was wrong about you . Both you and ... and jomore , you wanna put me in a cage ... Like frightened little men . And I thought you had more humanity , more imagination . ( exclaims ) don 't worry , lieutenant ... I 'll look after Matt . ( whoosh ) Forgive the sudden appearance , Matthew . I neglected to tell you , I 'm somewhat more than meets the eye . Let 's talk as we drive , shall we ? ( stammers ) Where 's my dad ? ( groans ) Matt . ( breathing heavily ) No . ( keys beeping ) Haldane ! Yeah , Brogan ? Get over here ! Humes has Matt ! What ? Unfortunately , your father couldn 't be with us , Matthew . You see , he 's ... he 's not like you and I. No , he ... he doesn 't have our sense of adventure . They 've had one hell of a head start . Damn ! I should 've seen it comin ' ! got it ! You can be rich , have anything you desire . What if I just wanna go home ? You don 't wanna disappoint me , Matthew . See , I ... I haven 't been dealing very well with disappointments . Humes , come in ! You talk to me ! ( screams ) Dad ! Matt ! Matt , are you all right ? Excuse me . Go home , Brogan . No ! Give me my son ! This is your doing ! ( Brogan grunts ) Dad ! We 're through with him now , Matthew . But my dad ! Haldane : He knocked out our servos . Get me something ! Anything ! Secondaries are responding . Come on ! Come on ! We belong only to each other . Yeah , I guess you 're right . It 's just you and me . We can go anywhere , do anything . Tell me about something you 've always wanted to do , some dream . You know , I never did get a good look at that asteroid . Well , that got the old heart started . Where are they goin ' ? he 's headed towards the asteroid . Smart , Matt . Very smart . Oh , it 's ... it 's truly spectacular . Yeah . Can 't wait to get closer ? Yeah . ( electronic beeping ) What 's ... what 's happening to me ? It 's working . The asteroid 's radiation is shutting ' him down . ( slowly ) I 'm losing control . Slamball done ! ( laughs ) Matt , can you get control of the ship ? I won 't let you . No , dad ! They 're goin ' in . Matt , activate the passenger escape system . How do I do that ? Open the ejector panel and press the release button . Come on , hurry ! It won 't open . It ... it 's stuck . Pull , Matt ! Pull hard ! It won 't open ! Go . Go home , Matt . ( rapid beeping ) All right , he 's okay . Yeah , he 's safe . Hang on , Matt . We 're comin to get ya . Man , that 's one ice cube I 'll never forget . ( laughs ) Yeah , that 's kinda funny to think that 's Humes ' graveyard , not once but twice . It 's a brave thing you did by goin ' up there . Yeah , well , when in doubt , think . Who said that ? Gee , dad , I just did . Oh , so you did . You know that stuff I wanted ... When he asked me , all I really wanted was to be here . Come here , kid . You know , I wonder how much it 'd cost to keep mom from finding out what happened . Can 't blame a guy for tryin ' . sleep Well , Matt , with no bad dreams , while others walk alone . ( dramatic music playing )

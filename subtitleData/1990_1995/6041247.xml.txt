 [ Announcer ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . All right , where are we ? " Children , close-up . " Sure . Master shot . Nah , not so hot . [ footsteps ] All right . [ chains rattling ] OK , close-up , and that 's that . Jeez , lousy prop . Don 't they ... [ object thuds ] Oh ! Oh , jeez , Frank , you shouldn 't come up on me like that . I just had a bypass . No , no , no . - [ growls ] - This isn 't what I wanted . It looks too ' 50s . - It doesn 't look real either . - [ growling ] [ chuckles ] Well , what are you waiting for ? You go back and tell Max that I 'm gonna buy him a hearing aid , so next time I ask him to do something , he 'll do it . Well , go on ! [ growls ] Very funny . - [ growling ] - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! [ bones cracking ] [ yelling ] [ growling ] - Morning . - Mm , hi . Ready for another day of filing , faxing and brewing coffee ? If that 's what they need . I think they 're threatened by us . What do you mean ? They 're afraid that if we go out into the field we 'll do a better job than them . Lana , I think they just want us to be a little more experienced first . Do you really believe that ? No . [ chuckles ] [ Jackson ] Kent ! Lang ! I 've got something for you . - The Lloyd case . - The movie director ? Supposed to have been killed by some kind of a monster . - I just filed that one . - No , there was a witness . You want me to file that , too ? No , I want the two of you to go out and interview him . [ Matt coughs ] Us ? - Or I could send Matt . - No , no . We 'll do it . Dennis , you are a real ... [ door unlocks ] - [ Clark ] Mrs. Watson ? - Yes . I 'm Clark Kent , this is Lana Lang . We spoke to you earlier today . Sure , about the monster . Can we see your husband ? If you 'd like to , but he 's not the one you should be talking to . Tommy , there 's some people here to see you ! Thank you , Mr. Jackson . My dad works at the studio . He lets me come to work with him sometimes . I 'm going to be a director . But Tommy , what about the monster ? Oh , yeah , like I was saying , I heard this guy scream on Stage 21 . I looked in and I saw it . The monster ! It was choking him like this . Oh ! Tommy ! Tommy ! OK , OK . And then it just ran away . Did anybody else see it ? No , just me . You don 't believe me , do you ? - Tommy , it 's just that we ... - I 'll show you . This is what I saw . That 's just from a movie . It 's not real . Hey , I 've got an IQ of 145 , I 've skipped two grades in school , and I 'm at advanced-expert level at " Turbo Kong . " I know if something 's real or not . - OK , but ... - What 's your IQ ? [ woman ] It 's beautiful , Milt , every word . It made me cry real tears . [ chuckles ] Yeah , you 're wonderful . Right , see you at the Oscars . In your dreams . - [ man on phone ] Yeah ? - Hello , Chuck ? - Yeah ? - It 's Risa Owens . - Uh-huh ? - Boy , do I need a rewrite . - It 's only a one pager . - Uh-huh ? Milt really let me down this time . He 's old , is what he is ! Let me tell ... Hello ? Hello ? I 'm trying to make a call here . Take a number ! What is ... - [ gurgling ] - [ screams ] [ man ] Yeah , that 's mine . So what ? Mr. Von Norman , two people have been killed . One of them by something that looked like this thing . This isn 't a thing . It 's a man wearing makeup . A man who 's been in Vancouver all summer . [ Clark ] Anybody can wear makeup . That 's a good point , that 's what I told the police . [ Lana ] The police ? You know , those guys in uniforms that investigate murders ? They came by a few days ago asking the same questions you 're asking . And what did you tell them ? I told them somebody broke into my house last month and stole some masks and prosthetics . I thought it was a fan , but apparently it was some kind of psycho . Maybe whoever it is is both . It 's a fine line in this business . Doesn 't it bother you that somebody 's out there in your makeup killing people ? It would be , if people were dying . But they are . No . They 're producers and directors ... not people . [ man ] All right , everybody . Quiet on the set ! - Ooh , a little bitter , huh ? - [ man ] Quiet , please ! Roll sound ! Action ! You see ? Machines can do almost anything . Hmm , anything but lie and cheat and ... [ sighs ] I 'm sorry . I forgot the line again . [ man ] Cut ! Get me another one . [ man ] Another cigarette for Mr. Melville . Not the cigarette , the girl . And make sure this one can act . [ squeals ] Well , at least it wasn 't your fault this time . It 's hard to believe he 's the same guy that does all those commercials for the South American orphans , huh ? Andy ! What are you doing here ? Well , it 's a part-time job , but I figure in a year I 'll be directing . Only a year ? I 'm gold at this place . Hey , McAlister , what about that coffee ! I-I 'm right on it . That 's what you said an hour ago . He doesn 't think you 're gold . Yeah , like he counts . He 's just a writer . So what are you guys up to ? We 're here to see Max Von Norman . Yeah , Max ? He 's the greatest . He 's such a happy guy , too . It 's an occupational hazard , you know ? Six months ago , he couldn 't get arrested and now he 's a genius . [ chuckles ] [ instrumental music playing ] [ low growling ] Lisa ? Carrie ? Lisa and Carrie ? [ growling ] [ gasping ] [ low growling ] Oh ! Thanks a lot ! [ laughing ] [ screaming ] - You all right ? - I don 't know . What was it ? It was a guy in a monster suit . There ! I don 't think that 's a guy in a suit . I 'm gonna call security . [ growling ] [ air rushing ] [ woman ] Oh , my God ! Watch out ! Watch out ! [ crowd gasping ] It was real . How did you know ? Just a hunch . What was it ? Where did it come from ? All the police know is that thing killed Robin Melville . Von Norman didn 't have to kill it , Superboy had it down . - Well , maybe he was afraid . - For Superboy ? No , afraid that maybe we 'd find out something [ Von Norman ] " Best special effects in a horror film . " Do they think this can make up for all those years of abuse ? [ chuckles ] The humiliation ? The insults ? Do they think they can buy my friendship with this ? Six months ago I was dirt , now everybody wants me to work on their films . To be at their parties , to have lunch with them . [ growls ] And I go along smiling , kissing their cheeks . But all that stops tonight . Caliban . Where is Ajax ? Ajax , he was killed ... [ grunts ] ... by Superboy . [ growling ] He was sent by the ones who are going to be here tonight . No ! No more killing . That was our bargain . You do what I tell you to do , just like you did for my father . Then ... Your father never asked us to kill for him . That 's it . You wanna stop . You wanna go back to where he found you ? Good , then let 's go . You 've got a busy day . Up to about six months ago , Max 's stuff was terrible . Make a list : Lowry , Lou Lloyd , Risa Owens ... Owens and Lloyd were both murdered . Oh , forget it . If Max was going around trying to kill he 'd need an A-bomb . Besides , everybody loves him now . He just turned it around . All of a sudden his stuff became a lot more realistic . As good as anything his dad ever did . Look , I wanna show you this other project . How can you not remember where you saw a monster ? I see them day and night . I see them in my dreams . It 's easy to lose track . Boy , you shoulda seen that fight last night . That thing was almost as strong as Superboy . Really ? Yep , but for once someone else got to be the hero . Max turned it into a pile of ashes . He suddenly jumps out with this flamethrower . Hey , Lana ! We 're gonna go look at some tapes . [ Clark ] Andy thinks he saw the monster before . - You saw it before ? - Yeah , I 'm sure of it . I 'd like to see them but ... She 's going to Von Norman 's party with me . Von Norman 's party ? I wasn 't invited to that . [ Clark ] I hope these tapes help you remember . Yep , it 's going to be just like Saturday nights You , me and the VCR . - I 'll go get the pizza . - All right . [ piano playing ] Hey ! Oh , ladies ' room . That 's what they always say . [ sighs ] [ scary music playing ] [ woman screaming , monster growling ] I knew I 'd seen you somewhere before . [ knocking on door ] Yeah , Clark , come on in . [ door opens ] I think I found our monster . [ growling ] [ door creaks ] [ Von Norman ] Miss Lang . Here for a preview ? [ gasps ] Andy , it 's Clark . [ sniffs ] I got the pizzas . Andy ? " Special monster effects by Max Von Norman , Jr . " [ air rushing ] This is what all the others are going to get . - Only you 're going to be first . - [ yelps ] What is it ? I 've always been afraid to ask that question . [ gasping ] What 's back there ? Kind of like a different dimension , That 's why his monsters always looked so real . They were real . Get him ! He killed Ajax ! [ gurgling ] Stop ... or he dies . [ growling ] Go , my friend . You are free to go . What are you doing ? You lied ! Superboy didn 't kill Ajax ! Wait , Caliban , I can explain . Ask him ! He saw ! No wait ! Wait ! No ! Stop ! Where did they go ? Movie magic .

Oh , my goodness , what 's happening ? It 's okay . Wejust had a fat . - No problem here , honey . - Oh , no . ( Sighing ) Darn it . Honey , would you mind holding the light for a second ? ( Yelling ) Paul ! Paul ? Paul ! Where areyou , Paul ? ! What happened ? ! Paul ! Paul ! ( Barking ) Here we go , boy . ( Whistling ) Let 's go over here . Come on , boy . Man : Over here ! We found something . Easy , easy , easy . ( RetchingAndCoughing ) Man : His leg 's been eaten off . Man : Hey , up here ! ( Whistling ) Come on ! It 's in here . It 's as tall as a house . We can smoke him out . And then what ? I see it ! He 's coming at us ! Working hard , Mulder ? This woman claims ... to have been taken aboard a spaceship ... and held in an antigravity chamber ... without food and water for three days . Antigravity is right . Sorry to interrupt ... your serious investigation , but I just heard a story ... that wouldjust about takeyour knees out . What 's that ? They found a body in the NewJerseywoods yesterday ... missing its right arm and shoulder . They think they may have been eaten offby a human . Where in NewJersey ? just outside Atlantic City . Not an uncommon place to lose a body part . Do they think it 's the mob ? It was a homeless man . There doesn 't seem to be a motive . You feeling lucky , Scully ? Relative to whom ? It 's not our case , Mulder . The local police are handling it . An X-file ? Ever hear ofsomething called " TheJersey Devil " ? Yeah . A beast that comes out ofthe woods and attacks cars , right ? Kind oflike an East Coast Bigfoot ? Read the file about the case in 1 947 . Save me the trouble . 1 947 . Familywatches dad get dragged into the woods . Cops find dad with a few appendages gnawed off . Cops gun down a large naked man in the woods . Autopsy shows human fesh and bones ... in the man 's large intestine- - a beast man . is the autopsy report here ? No . The original disappeared ... from the Paterson P.D. ' s files a fewyears later . There is a statement from the attending pathologist . It 's the same story I 've heard since I was a kid . It 's a folktale , a myth . I heard the story when I was a kid , too . Funny thing is , I believed it . Thanks , Lorraine . We got a cannibalized body in NewJersey . Someone or something out there is hungry . ( Sighing ) They say animals can develop an appetite for human fesh ... but this is no animal . You see the teeth marks just below the clavicle ? They 're human . Who found the body ? Park ranger . Was he alive when it happened ? It 's hard to tell . There 's a skull fracture , but no sign ofa struggle . His blood-alcohol level was up . Probably never knew what hit him . Any ideas about that ? From the size ofthat bite mark , I 'd say a large adult male . Detective Tomson is handling the case . Glenna ? I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully , and this is Agent Fox Mulder . I don 't remember anybody calling the F.B.l. in on this . We 're not here in an official capacity . Agent Scully is a medical doctor . We heard aboutyourvictim . She thought she might take a look . I 'm going to askyou to leave . We have an investigation . Tommy , this is no time to get pissy . We havejurisdiction . Any suspects , Detective ? I don 't work foryou , sir . Unless you hear different from the attorney general ... this case is a local matter . Agent Mulder , we should go . There 's no need to get bent out ofshape . On the contrary . I think I 've been exceedingly polite . So what 's eating that guy ? He was perfectly in his rights . The F.B.l. has no overridingjurisdiction ... on a murder case . You 'd feel the same way ... ifsomeone was horning in on yourwork . Chances are he 's without a clue . He 'll probably be scratching his head ... when they bring the next body in . You could have really humiliated him ... and told him who the perpetratorwas- - theJersey Devil . What doyou saywe grab a hotel , take in a foor show ... drop a few quarters in the slot ... and do a little digging on this case ? You 're kidding , right ? We can skip the foor show . I have to be back in D.C. Got a date ? No . I have my godson 's birthday party at 6 : 30 . What areyou doing ? A little poking around . Maybe make a weekend out ofit . It 's a three-hour drive back by myself- - in Friday-night traffic . ( CoinsJingling ) Change for 50 . Found the body just over there ... lying facedown on the rocks . 32 years with the park service . I 've come across some weird stuff ... but never anything like this . The victim was a homeless man . You get many ofthem out here ? Well , occasionally I 'll see some ... but most are scared ofthe woods . Scared ? Ofwhat ? I don 't know . The devil . People say that 'sjust a myth . Depends on whoyou talk to . What doyou think ? Well , like I said , you know , 32 years ... I see a lot ofweird stuff . Like one time ... a little over fouryears ago ... I saw what I thought was a large man ... come out ofa copse ofbirch trees- - not a stitch ofclothing . He was about 60 yards away . And he starts sniffing the air ... you know , like a dog ... and then he looks straight at me ... and I swear he smelled me ... because he took off into the woods so fast ... you 'd swear he wasn 't human . Really ? You never saw him again ? No . But I feel him ... and ... I 've found things . Some scat , half-buried like a cat 's ... only more human . Found a half-eaten rabbit with what looked like ... a human cuspid tooth in it , and some deer bones ... that looked like they 'd been sharpened into tools . Doyou think it might be responsible for the bodyyou found ? Well ... I got a pension coming up in a fewyears . You say the wrong thing- - Yeah . I 'll tell you one thing . I don 't ever come out here without myweapon anymore . How far is it into town from here ? About a mile , mile and a half . I 'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway ... for the next couple days . Ifyou think ofanything , will you call me ? Sure . All right . ( Children Laughing ) Look at this gorilla ! Hey , I can 't see ! Where am I ? ( Crying ) Oh , come here . It 's okay . It 's all right . What happened ? Did you bumpyour head ? Oh , Cruiser , stop that ! Go on . What- - What happened ? jungle warfare . Oh , I 'm going to kill that dog . Ifthe hit squad doesn 't get to him beforeyou do . I 'm so glad you 're here , Dana . ( Party Horn Blowing AndChildren Yelling ) Oh , you 're amazing . What ? You 're such a natural at all this . I don 't know how you keep it all together . Mommy radar . I don 't think I 'm cut out for this , Ell . Dana , you went through the F.B.l. Academy . What better training could there be for motherhood ? Seriously . You 're great with kids . What areyou talking about ? When am I supposed to find the time ? Firstyou have to get a life . And , ofcourse , it helps to find a man . Know ofany ? Yeah , they 're disappearing ... faster than the Brazilian rain forest . What about that guy you workwith ? Mulder ? You said he was cute . He 's ajerk . He 's not ajerk . He 's , um ... He 's obsessed with his work . ( DoorbellRinging ) Hi . Hi . I 'm Rob . I 'm Scott 's dad . Oh . Come in . Thanks . Hey , tiger . Howyou doing ? Having a good time ? ( Whispering : ) Divorced . ( People Talking ) Did anybody here know Roger Crockett ? He was murdered two days ago . Ma 'am , can I .. ? Woman : Hey , honey , you got any change to spare ? Mulder : Roger Crockett ? Anybody . What doyou want to know ? Did you know Roger Crockett ? Did you hear how he died ? Yeah . Any ideas who might have done it ? You a cop ? No. I 'm F.B.l. I 'll showyou something . Okay . I need some money . What is this ? Stuck in the pocket ofajacket I found . Does it mean anything toyou ? I 've seen it . Where ? Right here , digging in the trash . Areyou hustling me ? Swear to God . What doyou think it is ? I don 't know . Scared the hell out ofme . Has anybody else seen it ? Oh , yeah . Everybody 's pretty freaked . Anybody tell the cops ? You think they don 't know ? Whereyou sleeping tonight ? You 're standing in my bedroom . You know the Galaxy Gateway ? Room 756 . Go ahead . Hey , they got HBO ? Yeah , they do . ( Rustling ) ( Dog Barking ) ( Fence Rattling ) ( Soft Thudding ) ( RaggedBreathing ) ( Soft Grunting ) ( Sniffiing ) ( Siren Wails ) Sir . You got a man on that roof . Nothing to be afraid of . We 'll giveyou a place to sleep it off . - Back off . - Calm down . There 's a man up there . Get in the car , now . What doyou think you 're doing ? Enjoying the night life ... here in beautiful Atlantic City . I 'll go to the D.A. ifl have to . Obstructing an investigation ... misconduct . Let 's go see her together . We 'll add " withholding evidence " to the list . What areyou talking about ? Statements given toyou ... describing something stalking the back streets ofAtlantic City . This is the fishing trip ... they get me up at 3 : 00 in the morning for ? Unbelievable . Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight ? You know it 's out there . I got a perpetrator out there . Whether it 's Hannibal the Cannibal or Elmer Fudd ... I 've got ajob to protect people . Oh , is thatyourjob ? Or is it to keep the dice rolling , keep the tour buses rolling in ? You can 't fill those casinos , this town disappears ... like a quarter down the slot . I 've seen it . Seen what ? ( Chuckling ) You 've been spending too much time ... in supermarket check-out lines . This story 's as old as the hills . Who 's going to be responsible ... when you lose your first tourist , Detective ? You are . No , you are , sir ... becauseyou 're wasting my time ... and impeding the solution ofthis case . You want to go on a safari , go to Africa . In the meantime , enjoy the rest ofyourweekend . Agent Scully . Agent Mulder , line three . Where areyou ? Notfarfrom whereyouleftme . You 're still in Atlantic City ? Uh , Scully , yougotanything happening thismorning ? What 's that noise in the background ? ( Retching ) That 's a guy getting sick . Mulder , where areyou ? The drunk tank ? Isawthis thingon theroof . Well , it 's not hard to see ... why they mistookyou for a vagrant . You going to rag on me ... or areyou going to get me something to eat ? Am I buying ... or did you manage to panhandle some spare change ? It moved like a cat , quick and graceful . A human couldn 't have gotten up on a roofthat fast . Mulder . What ? What will happen when the Bureau finds out ? They dropped the charges . Tomson ran me through the system to spite me . I 'm talking about thisJersey Devil . I saw it. lt 's exactly what the ranger described . The way it moved , sniffed the air . It 's out ofthe woods , probably in search offood . I 'll say . It picked through the garbage . lfit was a man-eater , why didn 't it come after me ? Probably felt threatened . You 're ascribing it a motive and an alibi . This thing chewed somebody 's arm off . It 's not exactly a defensive posture . Butyou do believe I saw something ? You saw something , but I won 't go in and sell it ... when it 's nothing more than a sighting in a dark alley . I 'm still paying for a hotel room . I have to get back to Washington by 7 : 30 . Another birthday party ? No . I have a date . Can you cancel ? Unlikeyou , Mulder , I would like to have a life . I have a life . Come on. I have somebody I wantyou to meet ... on the way home . Come on . Hold on . just about every culture has one- - Yeti , Sasquatch , the Russian Almas . Why is that ? It 's a universal wild man myth- - a symbolic fear ofour dual natures as humans ... as creators oflife and destroyers ofit . What 's this chart ? It shows the historic entry ofman onto each continent ... and the effect it had on other animal species ... which has been disastrous . Why ? We humans have retained hereditary traits ... through evolution ... that have proven to be extremely destructive . We tend to be tribal and aggressively territorial ... oriented by selfish sexual and reproductive drives ... that make cooperation beyond the family or tribe ... extremely hard for us . So we kill other species in order to survive . Humans are top carnivores . We sit at the top ofthe food chain ... and reduce other species chances ofsurvival . Nice to know Dana left here with more than a degree . But what ifsomething entered the food chain above us ? It won 't happen . Our intelligence virtually ensures ... that , barring the introduction ofsome alien life-form ... we will live out our days as rulers ofthe world . But what if , through some fuke ofnature ... a human was born ... who reverted to its most animal instincts ? A kind ofcarnivorous Neanderthal . Wouldn 't he occupy a space above us on the food chain ? Oh , sure . All he 'd have to do ... is wait outside any fast-food restaurant ... and eat us on the way in . Haven 't there been cases ... where men have been raised in the wilderness by animals ... who have no language and hunt like predators ? Yes , but cannibalism is rare ... even among lower mammals . But even when faced with extinction ? Maybe in thejungles of New Guinea . It 'sjust highly unlikely that whatyou 're suggesting ... could have survived civilization or evolution ... out in the woods of NewJersey ? Highly unlikely ... but not outside the realm ofextreme possibility ? Well , it would be an amazing discovery . Rob : The hard thing ... was when mywife remarried . Suddenly I felt very competitive for my son 's attention . It was weird . I 'm sure . I became a superdad on the weekends with Scott . I had this unconscious fear ofbeing replaced . I actually had dreams ... where l was running over his stepfatherwith my car . You 'll understand when you have kids . Having kids changes everything . That 's what they say . Maybe some weekend ifyou 're up for it ... we could take the kids out to the beach for the day . Yeah . Great . Thankyou . Can I ask about the case you 're on , or can 'tyou say ? Well ... I don 't think it 's a case we should discuss over dinner . I don 't suppose you 'd want to hear ... about the finer points ofestate planning and taxation ? ( Telephone Ringing ) Mulder . AgentMulder , this is PeterBrouillet ... oftheJersey Parks Department . Oh , yeah . Hi . I found a body out in the woods today . Itlooks likeit 'sbeen dead six to eightmonths . A long-haired male ... missing the same tooth I found in that rabbit . Could beyour devil . Where 's the body now ? I turneditover to the coroner 's offiice . You 're sure it was a male ? Ithadall theplumbing . Excuse me . Mm-hmm . ( Beeping ) I 'm sorry . Excuse me . Certainly . ( Ringing ) Scully . Mulder . Sorrytointerruptyourevening . That 's okay . What 's up ? I just had an amazing thought . Maybe it isn 't a beast man we 're looking for after all . Well , ifthey picked it up ... nobody logged the body on the chart . I sure haven 't seen it . What else would they have done with it ? We called you here for nothing . They 're going to sweep this under the carpet . Why ? Any publicity , and the streets will be crawling ... with people who aren 't here to play craps . Word gets out there 's something on the loose , forget it . It 's a female ? The body they found was a male . There 's a 50-50 chance there was a mate . We may never know unless we find out ourselves . lfit 's true , what are the chances ofcapturing it alive ? lfit is a primate ... it would have a natural fear ofheights . It would also want to stay close to its food source . This thing has no fear ofheights . We 'll start with the lower foors . How much time will that dart give us ? It will put down a 500-pound bear for an hour ... ifl hit it . What the hell 's a park rangervehicle doing here ? I don 't know . Check it out . Run a check for me on- - Something here . It 's blood . She could be bringing her killing here . She could be injured . Roger . Zebra Team in position . What ifit is a female , Scully ? How close is she toyou or me ? Does she feel emotion ... or are her daysjust spent looking for food ? Maybe she spends her day shopping . Eight million years out ofAfrica- - l don 't think we 're all that different . Mulder , we 've put men into space . We 've built computers ... that work faster than the human mind . While we overpopulate the world ... and create new technologies to kill each otherwith ? Maybe we 'rejust beasts with big brains . What ? No , I wasjust ... thinking about my godson 's birthday party . Eight little six-year-old boys running around . Talk about primitive behavior . Tomson : Hisnameis Mulder . He 'sa federalagent . You know him ? No . Whatareyoudoinghere ? I 'm aprofessor ofanthropology . Mulder . Does thatsoundfamiliar ? I know he 's here somewhere . Will you check upstairs , Andrew ? I want thisplacesearched top tobottom- - Move , move ! ( Metallic Banging ) Scully : Mulder ... Mulder , whereareyou ? ( Metallic Clanking ) ( Snarls ) ( Groaning ) Mulder ? ( Grunting ) Scully . Lay back . Oh , Mulder , you 're hurt . You should have seen her . She was beautiful . Yeah , well , shejust about ripped your lungs out . She could have torn my head off ... but she sensed I wasn 't a threat . I need federal jurisdiction on this case . How old would you say she was ? The U.S. Assistant D.A. is on the phone . He wants to know what 's going on . Tell him he 's got a real live Neanderthal on the loose . She was young . The Atlantic City major crime unit ... has filed a complaint ... that we 're endangering a murder investigation . That is such crap- - They got her cornered in a building . Let 's go . It crawled into the wall . Get a man in there . Affiirmative . Keep these people out ofhere . You can take her alive . - ( Man Yelling ) - What 's going on ? I 'vegotaman down . A nakedwomanjustjumped from asecond-story window . Suspect is headed south into the woods on foot . Good boy . I know these woods . She 's going for cover down by the rocks . Keepyour eyes to the left . Stay alert . ( Groaning ) Look . Can you reach her from here ? I can try . ( Grunting ) ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshot ) ( Men Yelling ) Man : I got it ! Good shot . She tried to take my arm off . Man : Looks like she tried to bury herself . Why did you have to kill her ? Same reason you kill a rabid animal . ( Sighing ) Hi . Thisjust came through . It 's a posthumous medical exam ofthe woman 's body . They found fragments ofhuman bone ... still in her digestive tract . They estimated her age to be 25 to 30 years . They allowed Dr. Diamond to do a medical exam ofthe body ... but he found nothing ... that suggested prehistoric bone structure ... or physiology . The A.C.P.D. has her listed as aJane Doe ... in a search for her identity ... and state psychiatric records has begun in earnest . Good luck . They have also released the medical exam ... from the male body that they found . His age is estimated to be about 40 years . There would have been offspring . The medical exam ofthe woman 's uterus ... seems to indicate that she may have given birth . She was protecting her children . It all makes sense . The male dies ... and she comes out ofthe woods in search offood . Do me a favor . Go out and have a beer . Take the day off . I 'll cover foryou . just take some time foryourself . Thanks , but I 've got an appointment ... at the Smithsonian with an ethnobiologist . - ( Telephone Ringing ) - l can 't wait to tell him . Mulder . Yeah , just a second . It 's foryou . Hello . Hi , Dana . It 's Rob . Oh , hi . I have Scott for the night ... and we have two extra tickets for Cirque du Soleil . We thoughtmaybeyou 'dlike toask Ellen ... ifyoucould take Trent andjoin us . Requisition for a car , please , Fran . Thankyou . Who was that on the phone ? A guy . Same guyyou had dinnerwith the other night ? Same guy . You going to have dinner with him again ? I don 't think so . No interest . Not at this time . Thanks , Fran . What areyou doing ? Going with you to the Smithsonian . Don 'tyou have a life ? Keep that up and I 'll hurtyou ... like that beast woman . Eight million years out ofafrica . And lookwho 's holding the door . Dad , did youjust see something down there ? Where ? Over there . No. I 'm sure it was nothing . No. I saw something . Did you ever hear the story oftheJersey Devil ? When I was a kid ... my dad used to tell this story about a creature ... who lived out there in the woods . It was halfman , halfanimal . I used to believe- -

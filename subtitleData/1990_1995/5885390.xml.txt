 [ Squeaking ] [ Crunching ] [ Yelling ] [ Men chattering ] Goddamn vulture . [ Spits ] - [ All gasping ] - [ Gasps ] ♫ [ Honky-tonk piano ] ♫ [ Stops ] Miss Kitty . Mr. Gaunt . You 're the only one who 's ever happy to see me . Everyone is dead when they see you . Have you ever considered the possibility , Mr. Gaunt , that people don 't welcome you 'cause you scare the shit out of ' em ? I mean , when you show up , people die . It 's not cause and effect , Marshall . I simply have a knack for being in the right place at the right time . [ Glass breaks ] [ Glass breaks ] [ Glass breaks ] [ Glass breaks ] [ Glass breaks ] [ Both ] I 'll raise you ... - A hundred . - Fifty . - A hundred . - Fifty . - Aces and eights . - ♫ [ Playing " We 're in the money " ] [ Glass breaks ] [ Glass breaks ] Redeye . Get the hell out of here . Move ! Dead man 's hand . They say on Altearth that Wild Bill Hickok was holding aces and eights ... when he was shot ... dead . Superstitions from some old planet light-years away . - Right , Marshall ? - Whatever you say , Miss Kitty . Meow ! [ Glass breaks ] [ Glass breaks ] [ Electricity zapping ] Well , I say , dump this card game , come upstairs with me , and we 'll play some strip poker . It 's the only game I love to lose . Oh , I had ' em sharpen just for you . [ Redeye calling out ] Marshall Stone ! Stone , get your ass out here ! I 'm calling you out , Stone . What 's the matter ? Not man enough to face me ? Or maybe you 're too much man . Too much human . We all know what gutless cowards humans are , don 't we ? Ah . I 'll be waiting . Come on , Marshall . We 've got better things to do . It 's a matter of respect , Miss Kitty . Some things cannot be ignored . Don 't worry . I won 't hurt him . Right there will do just fine . You got a problem , Redeye ? Yeah ! Yeah , I got a problem . You , Marshall . That won 't be a problem much longer . You are a sick individual . Damn right I am . I 'm sick of you . I 'm sick of the Galaxico . I 'm sick of the guild . I 'm sick of all this crap ! But I got me heavy-caliber vaccine to cure my ills . - Is that a fact ? - Definitely . Lights out , Marshall . [ teeth chattering ] [ Muttering ] [ Screams ] Nice catch . Practice makes perfect . Sh- - sh- - sh- - [ Screaming ] I guess the force field wasn 't working up to snuff today . [ Hissing ] [ Screaming ] [ Distorted ] You son of a bitch ! Not so fast , half-breed . Boys . Much better . Won 't be needing this anymore . [ Shrieks ] No point in my messing up such a prime pussy as yourself . - [ Hissing ] - Bork . Attend to deputy Stell Barr , would you , please ? [ Laughing ] So much for guild interference . Thanks to that load of daconium we found , this town 's up for grabs . And I know who 's going to be the biggest grabber . [ Laughing ] [ Clicking ] Great . Just what I needed- - more gold . [ Grunting ] [ Yelling ] It 's a good day to die . [ Gunshot ] [ Shrieking ] For scorps , maybe . For what purpose am I saved ? I have nothing . Well , if you have nothing , then you don 't have to worry about losing what you got . You are wrong . There 's no death to be reached when one cannot sink lower . Well , things could be worse . So live . Who are you ? Zack . Zack Stone . Zack Zack Stone , either untie me or kill me . Just stop talking . That was a pretty nasty scorp heading your way . Lucky for you it was a baby . The adults usually wait for nighttime to forage . What 's your name ? - I am Buteo . - Buteo . Let 's get some water inside you , Buteo , and then you- - No . No drink , no food . Not until I have buried my family . We got to plan our next moves carefully . Just ' cause the Marshall 's dead don 't mean this town rolls over . He 's right . We can 't simply shoot everyone . Now that the Marshall 's dead ... and that cyborg deputy of his is no problem , as long as we have our stash of daconium , we 're gonna show the good people of Oblivion ... the great advantages to a town run by Redeye ... - and his dedicated associates . - Hear , hear ! Associ-whats ? Gangs , Bork . Oh . Right . [ Redeye ] Excuse me , Bork . I have hemorrhoids smarter than you ! [ Grunts , chuckles ] Huh ? [ Redeye ] Spanner , you 'll work the town . Be charming . Be polite . Be sympathetic . We point out the guild was choking us with their rules and restrictions anyway . Keep Bork with you as backup ... just to remind folks who the muscle is around here . Wormhole , spread the word of what 's happened . Head out to the last stop cantina at the outskirts of the badlands ... and then make your way back to Oblivion . No problem , rojo ojo . Oh , sorry . Lash , you just be yourself . [ Laughs ] We just might have one ... teeny , weeny problem . I hear Stone has a son out prospecting somewhere . Hasn 't been back to Oblivion in years , from what they say . You don 't think I should be concerned with him , do you ? I don 't think you ... should be concerned ... about anyone . All of you on your way . Lash , there 's a few things I think we ought to take care of . I was thinking the same thing . [ Redeye ] Move ! Oh ! Mmm ! Aren 't you going to ask me to be gentle ? You 've got to be kidding . [ Laughing ] Well , I ... got the sonic protectors up . That 'll keep the night scorps away . You wanna talk about it ? No . Okay . I 'll just keep asking till you do . Killed my wife , my children . They took everything . Even a mere talisman of mine which is useless to them ... but has been in my family for generations . Now all that is left to me ... is this . - That locket ? - It contains the rays , yes . My wife made this for me . It is the first bit of daconium we ever found . Now it is the last that I own . - No , I couldn 't . - Do not insult me . It is yours . Who did this to you ? I only saw one of them clearly since it was so dark . If I see him again , however , he will die . - That 's pointless . - Pointless ? My family 's spirits cry out to be avenged . Vengeance is a hollow pursuit . It will not bring your family back to life . [ Howling ] As you wish . What is it ? A man is coming this way . You can tell that just by looking into your cup ? The liquid . Reflections are magic if you know how to read them . - So who is this visitor ? - He is the one called Gaunt . Gaunt ? The funeral man ? Must be because he found me . Gaunt only appears before death , not after . Then why is he heading here ? Unless one of us is gonna die . - You would run , Zack Zack Stone ? - Well , I should . Come on . Help me pack this stuff up . If you run into a den of night scorps , you will only hasten your fate you seek to flee . Excuse the intrusion , gentlemen . Zachary Stone ? - Well , how did you find me ? - I looked . The night scorps did not attack you ? For some reason , they see me ... and simply scatter away . Odd , isn 't it ? I bring unfortunate tidings . Your father has met an untimely alleviation of existence . He has shuffled off his mortal coil , closed the curtain on our veil of tears . He cavorts with the heavenly choir ... at this particular point in eternity 's endless march . What ? He 's dead . Jim , beam me up . Ah ! [ Bottle shatters ] Whiskey . Saloon 's down the street , Doc , in the cathouse . They cut me off there . Ha . Good for them . Sell me a bottle . Like hell . All right . [ Chuckling ] Give me a bottle . Look . We 're closed . But I 'll go in the back and make you some coffee . [ Angrily demanding ] I didn 't ask for coffee ! I want booze . [ Shouting ] Now ! This is my place , and nobody orders me around , Doc . Not even you , as much as I love you . I love you too , Mattie . Now , give me that goddamn booze . Doc , it wasn 't your fault . It must have been daconium . That had to have been what screwed it up . I promised him I 'd protect him . You want the coffee or not ? [ Regretful ] I 'm sorry I scared you , Mattie . It 's okay , Doc . I knew you wouldn 't really hurt me . Hell , this stupid thing ain 't even loaded . [ Gunshot ] sh- - [ Gaunt ] We have company . I can see that . Well , let me understand this . You didn 't want me to save your life , but now that I have , you 're staying with me . That is correct . But why ? - You need me . - I don 't need you . You do not recognize the fact that you need me . In that lies your greatest need . Fine . Whatever . I 'm going in here . Why ? It seems the most distasteful place . [ Man ] You can have the map . Forget about the boxes . Forget about the weights . I got to get going . I 'm in a rush . I 'm telling you , you owe me . Just give me the 50 . Give it to me now , I 'll get lost . What are you doing ? I told you , I weighed it . What the hell is that ? I already weighed it . I told you . 3.5 . Hey . And I happen to know what the going rate for daconium is . You , uh- - you don 't exactly look , uh , mathematically inclined . I added it up on my watch-comp . It 's guaranteed . Guaranteed reliable . Guaranteed ! Now , I know that you know that I know ... that you owe me 54.97 . Decimal point after the seven . Excuse me . Excuse me . Uh , you are slightly off ... by about , uh , 5,000 . What ? - What kind of a scam are you running here ? - Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Three grams . Uh , about- - Uh , 18 percent . See , see , that 's , uh- - 300 dirks . Now , uh , you can take it or you can leave it . This is a scam . I 'm getting scammed ! My watch-comp comes with a guarantee . Guarantee ! Hey , buddy , maybe your lead-lined case leaked ... and maybe your daconium threw your watch-comp out of whack . What 's two plus two ? Ask it . 54.97 . 54- - that ain 't right . That ain 't right . Uh , look on the bright side , Einstein . Uh , 300 will be just enough , just enough ... to buy you a new watch-comp . [ Snickering ] Watch this guy . [ Snickering ] Buster . Been a while . Zack . Listen to me , fellas . They killed Galaxico , everybody . They 'll be crawling to us under Redeye 's leadership . But ... Redeye needs men , the right kind of men . No , uh , nebula boys . You know what I mean . I 'm here looking for people who , uh , want to sign up . [ Man ] What 's in it for us ? You get to be a part of the winning team , huh ? You get our biannual newsletter . You , uh- - you learn the secret handshake . [ Scattered oohs ] But most important , you get our official " better red than dead " button ... [ Scattered oohs ] So that everybody knows you 've picked the right side . Are you satisfied with that amount ? I 'm satisfied . That much closer to buying my passage off this rock . You could probably have done better in Oblivion . Look , I 'm not Mr. Popular in that town , all right ? Do you wish to discuss it ? No . Very well . I will just keep asking until you do . Look . It 's not like I wished my father 's death or anything . You have to understand . - He tried to make me be ... - Yes ? Something I could never be . What ? Him . Well , well , well . Look who it is . The gutless son of the late ... Marshall . I really don 't wanna fight here , okay ? People , the gutless one really doesn 't wanna fight today . Okay ? I hate nebula boys , Zeke . His name is Zack . Oh , Zeke . This , uh , native ... is your friend ? Look , Buteo . This guy isn 't worth it . I really can 't hurt anyone . Who cares what he says ? People like him seek out weakness to exploit , to destroy . If you present yourself as weak , he will attack . Let him go . Please . Please . Enough , Buteo ! Stop it ! Now , wait a minute here . I don 't want any trouble from you guys . Buteo , let 's get out of ... here ! [ Wormhole yelling ] What are you doing ? ! [ All gasping ] Gaunt ! Don 't go . Don 't leave because the nebula boys are gonna die . Are you dead sure about that ? What happened to , uh , " I don 't wanna hurt anybody " ? Well , I don 't wanna hurt anyone . Unfortunately , you happen to be standing ... right where my gun 's about to go off . Boo ! [ Wormhole panicky ] [ Bell dings ] I think I 'll have ... a beer , my good fellow . A schlitz . [ Nervous ] Oh , um- - uh- - uh- - uh- - we 're out of schlitz . Then , buster , [ Thudding sound ] you 're out of beer . Where is my gun ? It 's under the register . I was afraid you might shoot off something you 'd need later on . [ Groaning ] [ Bell jingles ] I 'll be right back . [ Cash register rings ] May I help- - Good day , Miss Mattie . Get out of my store . Why , Mattie , I 'm appalled . Is that any way to talk to a customer ? It 's how I talk to murderers . Oh , is that what you call a fair fight ? Murder ? That 's what I call gunning down the best man in town . You 're gonna put up with that kind of talk from suzy homemaker , Redeye ? Miss Mattie , I 've always been very fond of you . You know that . Would you like to know why ? Because I 'm female and have a pulse . [ Wheezing laugh ] No . Because you 're a lady . A lady in the best sense of the word . There 's not near enough ladies in Oblivion . Oh . Hard to believe they could pass up the ambience . Doesn 't it bother your girlfriend ... you coming in here telling me how wonderful I am ? No . I 'm not the jealous type . Besides , there is plenty of Redeye to go around . More for you then . I don 't think you quite understand , Miss Mattie . I ... am the future of this town . I 'm giving you a chance to get in at the ground floor . Providing I let you get in . That right ? This is my store . Get the hell out ! [ Yelling ] Get out ! And what a nice store it is . Don 't you think ? Was . [ Laughing ] [ Lash satiric ] Well said . Stop it ! [ Screams ] [ Clattering ] What the hell- - Ethyl . Oops . [ Laughing ] Stop it ! Get out ! Shop ... till you drop . Candy . I love candy . - Delicious . - Oh ! ah ! [ Lash ] Really , darling , Your taste in jewelry- - Now , let 's see . Anything else ? Get out . [ Crying ] Any more cocoa in the back ? The next one who so much as twitches dies . I do believe she 's asking us to leave , my friends . Nice place . [ Laughing ] [ Crying ] He likes you , Mattie . Get out . And you know what ? I like you too . We could have a great time together . Instead , all you 've got is a totally thrashed store . Now , if you ask me , you might wanna do some thinking ... about what you want out of life . You- - you got the hots for Redeye and miss priss . What about me , Lash , huh ? What do you got for me ? I 'm ten times the man that lizard head could ever be . Prove it . Who found that big stash of daconium for Redeye , huh ? You got to do more than jump claims before you can jump me , Spanner . Besides , a real man would have kept it for himself ... instead of turning it over to Redeye . But then you wouldn 't know anything about that , now , would you ? [ Zack ] Oblivion . Home , sweet home . The funeral will be held later today . - I 'll have one of my assistants summon you . - Well , thank you for your help . Hee-yah . More disrespect . He was always so tidy ... and methodical . My father showed me this box once . He told me it contained his most personal effects , his most cherished valuables and memories , and if anything ever happened to him , he wanted me to have it all . And that 's why you came back here , isn 't it ? You hope that there 's enough in there to buy passage off Oblivion . Buteo , I don 't belong in this place . Pop never understood that . This world ... dries up your soul . There are some who find beauty in the most bleak surroundings . You know , now I know why I needed you . 'Cause I 'd never be able to come up with all these pointless philosophies by my lonesome . [ Clanging ] Son of a bitch . [ Shouting ] Son of a bitch ! - Hey ! What 's going on out there ? - We got company . - Get me out of here ! - I don 't know . [ Zack ] She looks dangerous . I 'm the deputy , you moron . Well , the ex-deputy . - Deputy ? - Yes , that 's right , genius . The deputy . Stell Barr . Okay ? Now , pick up the keys and let me out . So ... you 're Zack . Marshall mentioned you . Yeah ? When ? Every now and then , whenever he was drunk and pissed . He said you were a coward . Zack is no coward . I owe him my life . - Zack here rescued you ? - That is correct . Hmm . How nice of you to think about someone other than yourself . Why am I letting you out of here ? Zack Stone thinks about everyone except himself , and that is his weakness , and it 's also his strength . - Is that so ? - I know him better than any living being . I have read his heart and his soul . How long have you known him ? Two days . Sounds like a quick read . So you 're gonna take over being marshall now ? Look , kiddo . I 'm a cyborg , okay ? As much machine as human . I don 't want the top job . Aside from the fact that I have no desire ... to be the number-one target on the planet , Redeye has a huge stash of daconium . A fair fight . [ Chuckles ] That 's one thing . But he can short me out with that stuff with no problem . - I 'm not messing with those odds . - So you 're a quitter . Look who 's talking . Look . I wasn 't hired to do a job . No . You just walked out on your father . [ Gaunt ] The Marshall once mentioned to me ... that should it be necessary , he 'd prefer a closed-casket ceremony . He 'd wished to remember him as he was , [ Man ] B-9 ! For , my dear friends , what is the body but a meaningless shell , a receptacle for the spirit that makes us all what we are . [ Man ] N-34 ! Can 't we postpone the bingo game ? It 's disrespectful ! It 's Thursday . We always have bingo on Thursdays . [ Woman ] Bingo ! Thank god . Thank god . [ Man ] Congratulations . Find a seat , please . [ Gasps ] - Were you a friend of the Marshall 's ? - Me ? Not really . The Marshall died as he lived- - fighting for what he believed in . Rather than chatter on myself , I 'd like the Marshall 's son to say a few words . Go . Go ! [ Man whispering ] That 's his son . [ Woman whispering ] I know . Hey , pop . Most of you don 't know me . [ Man ] Mm-hmm . Some of you do and probably wish you didn 't . Sometimes I- - I think my father felt the same way . I know he did . [ Man ] G-49 ! It 's Thursday . Oh . Well , we didn 't see eye-to-eye on a lot of things . He felt too different . But the fact is , we were actually more alike ... than either of us was willing to let on . I remember when I was 17 , [ Man ] I-17 . Oh , Christ . Point is , my father taught me the most important lesson ... a man can teach his son- - that you 've got to stick to what you believe in , no matter what . Sometimes that even means not being a hero , even if somebody wants you to- - [ Man ] B-1 . Be one . [ Man ] Amen to that . And the point is ... that it was this very lesson that tore us apart , that fact that we - we just didn 't believe in the same things- - Right . One of you didn 't believe in having any guts . [ Man ] G-48 . [ People gasping ] [ All ] It 's Thursday . Oh . [ Man ] O-53 . So you 're the Marshall 's boy ? I 'm the Marshall 's killer . What are you gonna do about it ? [ Chuckling ] Who says diamonds are a girl 's best friend ? Robo-bitch . There will be no violence in this place . - I 'm not talking to you ! - There will be no violence in this place ! [ Man ] G-44 . Just came to pay our respects . [ Man ] N-40 . [ Redeye ] Didn 't want to miss seeing the dearly departed off . I do have some ethics . [ Chuckling ] [ Man ] B-5 . Well , peace lover , you really don 't care if I pay for what I did ? Oh , you 're gonna pay . I 'm just not gonna be the bill collector . We 're gone ! [ Man ] O-62 . Your daddy must have really hated your guts . [ Man ] Bingo ! [ People grumbling ] [ Gaunt ] " Ashes to ashes , dust to dust . " " Yea , though I fly through the black hole of death , I fear no evil , for thou art with me . " don 't see many natives around here . - Buteo , is it ? - Yes . Buteo . They say native men have incredible respect for women . That is true . They also say native men make the best lovers . And how is that ? Well , because of ... your stamina ... and endurance , your sensitivity and , uh , well , the remarkable size of your , uh- your , uh- - - Feet ? Yes . Your feet . Come on , kitty . Let 's go get drunk . Doctor 's orders . Excuse me . I didn 't get your name . Mattie Chase . How well did you know my father , Miss Chase ? Well enough to know that I respected him , Mr. Stone . He was a good man . You should 've stood up for him in there . One violent act leads to another and another in turn , and I won 't be part of that cycle . What does violence have to do with standing up for somebody you love ? I want people not to hurt . Life is hurt , Mr. Stone . You can 't separate the two . I 'm wasting my time talking to you . 'Cause you 're not listening to me . Obviously you see some point to it . Don 't you get it ? You 're a dreamer . My husband was just like you . He had faith in this world . He said we were pioneers . And after spending all our savings ... getting the general store set up , he got killed . Got killed by night scorps . He left me with a mountain of debt and a dream ... but no dreamer . All alone . It 's bullshit ! I know it 's bullshit , Mr. Stone . Obviously you 're the one without any hope here . Maybe you ought to climb in that grave with your husband and be done with it . Sorry . No , you 're not . You 're right . I 'm not . Hey , Doc . You in there ? [ Doc Valentine ] Yeah . What do you want ? Knew you 'd be here sooner or later . Well , how could I come all the way back to Oblivion ... and not say hey to Doc Valentine ? How are you doin ' , Doc ? How the hell do you think ? [ People chattering ] [ Man # 1 ] Do it ! [ Man # 2 ] Come on ! [ Man # 1 ] Let 's go ! [ Man # 2 ] Let 's go ! Don 't give up . Hold it tight ! Hold it real tight . This is gold . Come ! This is not your usual hangout , Mattie . I can 't believe that lousy son of his . Zack 's a good kid . Chip off the old block . Trouble is , he 's an empath . What 's an empath ? Mm , someone who experiences what you experience , only more so . When you suffer , he suffers . One day about five years ago , there was a robbery ... with a gunman named Groth . Zack had to hunt him down and kill him . That 's when Zack left town for good . Why ? When he killed Groth , he told me ... he felt everything Groth felt . I guess that was when he decided he 'd never take another life . He also realized he 'd be of no use to his father- - maybe even a danger- - so he left . And his mother ? She vanished a long time ago . [ Men shouting , laughing ] Hey ! Who 's next ? Come on ! Anybody ! I could keep this up all day . Would you play this game as a true man , for true stakes ? I can take anything you can dish out , native . Are you familiar with the creature called the mon-ding ? - No . - Rather poisonous . I purchased this one at the cimmaron exotic pet shop down the street . Sudden movements attract them . [ Creature growling ] [ People gasping ] They are also very irritable ... and detest being shaken up . [ Snarling ] you got one of them ding things in there ? That it , native ? That is correct . If there is one thing the mon-ding detest ... even more than being shaken up , it is fear . It will attack any source of fear that it senses , and that which knows fear ... burns at the mon-ding 's touch . Burns and dies . So you challenge me to a death match , huh , native ? [ Scoffs ] Why should I ? Otherwise , these men will know you as a coward . It 's your funeral . Stand back , please ! [ People gasping ] [ Growling ] Are you ready , tough guy ? [ Growls ] in the name of all that is sacred to me , I am ready . One , two , three , go ! [ Roaring ] [ Gasping ] You 're gonna die , native . Ain 't you afraid ? I ... fear nothing . Least of all , a man ... who would kill a family , stake out the father , all for daconium . That was you ? If I die this day , I swear ... by the great god kuk , I will haunt you until the day you die , and I will see you in hell ! [ Growling continues ] [ Shouting ] [ Indistinct ] [ No audible dialogue ] [ Growling continues ] Woo-hah ! [ Gasping ] [ Laughing ] Howdy . Not so fast , pocahontas . [ Spanish ] Pendejo . Glad you could join us . [ No audible dialogue ] Bork ! Get out here now ! Aw , nuts . [ Groaning ] We 're gonna have us a trial ! Something 's going on out there ... and I don 't like the feel of it . Stop right there , junior ! This has got nothing to do with you . He is right , Zack . This is not your concern . You take your hands off of him . All right . Now what are you gonna do ? [ Chuckling ] Make a citizen 's arrest ? It is my road to walk , Zack , and I will walk it alone . Actions have consequences . My actions , my consequences . And you better watch out , or I 'm gonna blow a hole in you ... like I did your bionic deputy . Stell ? Great scotty ! - Doc ! - I 'm comin ' ! I 'm comin ' ! I don 't like this one bit . I 'm not gonna get any work done in here . [ Distorted ] I am the only law this town has left . I have got to be here to hold down the fort . If I don 't fix you up , you won 't be holding down anything . Zack , get me that tricorder there . [ Stell moaning , muttering ] Why didn 't he- - [ indistinct ] anyway , huh ? Why ? [ Chuckling ] [ Crackling ] Power it down , Lash . Too much charge will knock him out . I want him to feel the pain . Naturally . Native . You stand accused of murder . How do you plead ? This is no court of law . It 's as close as you 're gonna get . That man Spanner murdered my family . Well , we only have your word for that , don 't we ? The word of a murderer ! - Yeah . - The fight was fair . Everyone saw ! What I see is I got a dead man and an uppity native . - Is that what you all see ? - [ All ] Yeah ! What I see ... is that my course was clear . I see that there are times ... when you do what should be done . - And there are times when you do what must be done . - [ Lash yawning ] - It is never a clear choice . - [ Indifferent ] Mm. mm . You do what you have to do . I love the way this guy talks ! Are you done ? Because we really gotta get started here . Lash . Okay , boys , give me some room . Mama 's gonna have herself some fun . [ Laughing ] Yee-haw ! [ Whip cracks ] [ Screaming ] [ Whip cracks ] [ Screams ] [ Doc Valentine ] The bullet did some damage . There 's no exit through that arm , but- - you promised me weeks ago you 'd put in an access panel . Damn it , Stell ! I 'm a doctor , not a magician ! [ Whip continues cracking ] [ Men ] Yeah ! - This is gonna hurt . - Do it ! [ Stell screaming ] [ Whip continues cracking ] Stop it ! Stop ! That 's enough ! Don 't get your knickers in a knot , princess . It 'll all be over soon . What 's the problem , Miss Mattie ? He 's just a native . I won 't stand by and watch you kill a man ! I 'm afraid you have no choice . Boss ? [ Chuckles ] Look . Actions have consequences . You get out of town , or I 'll kill you . You ain 't gonna kill nobody . For one thing , Gaunt ain 't around . And second , you ain 't got the guts . Are you willing to bet your life on that ? Don 't give me that shit , nebula boy . We both know ... you got sympathy . [ Redeye screaming ] Get him ! [ Gunshot ] [ Shouting ] All right . Who else ? [ Zack ] Who 's with Redeye now ? [ Scared ] We don 't need no stinking badges ! Watch out , Mattie . I am ... sorry , Zack . Truly , I am . It 's okay . Right world-view , wrong world . You did what you had to do . That must have hurt you , Zack , shooting all those men . What 's it matter to you ? You got what you wanted- - killing for the right reasons . I hope you 're happy . Goddamn it . [ Muffled scream ] We couldn 't bear to leave you behind , princess . We like you too much . [ Whimpering ] Delicious . [ Groaning ] Ooh , that must really hurt . No , you idiot ! You 're standing on my foot ! [ Sloshing ] - Eww ! - Look . Handy , isn 't it ? [ People chattering ] Good to have the law back in town . This may sound like cold comfort , but your Daddy would have been proud . - Yeah ? - Your Ma too . - I never knew her . - I did . Yeah ? What was she like ? She just said you were a hero . That makes you marshall , if you want the job . You 're empowered to make me marshall ? Oh , hell , kiddo , another two drinks in me , I 'm gonna make you emperor of the goddamn galaxy . Well , you 're awful quiet . I have said " thank you . " I have apologized for having a hand in making you what you did not wish to be . Beyond that , I have nothing to say . Nothing to say ? Buteo has nothing to say . Drinks for everyone ! - [ All cheering ] - Except- - - Cancel that ! [ All groaning ] - Your anger at Mattie was misplaced . - He 's right , you know . " He 's right , you know . " Is he ever wrong ? - No . - [ Stell ] No . [ Gaunt ] As you were . I thought you would want to know , I 'm about to head out to the badlands . - What 's in the badlands ? - Probably Redeye . That 's his favorite hidey hole whenever he 's in trouble . Someone is going to die there . Well , Mr. Psychic , give Redeye my regards . What 's gonna get him ? Night scorps ? I never know the who or the how . Just the when and the where . You know , I was a little rough with Mattie . Maybe I ought to go over to the general store and have a little talk with her . That is good . She isn 't there . Where is she ? With the people I saw escorting her out of town , I assume . Out of town ? Where out of town ? The badlands . Attention , everybody . Redeye 's kidnapped Miss Mattie . We 're getting a posse together and going after ' em ... to put and end to this thing once and for all ! [ All cheering ] I hear he 's hiding in the badlands . Mr. Gaunt 's leading the way . Who 's with me ? [ Native language ] [ Low chattering ] You guys sure know how to get ' em all riled up . [ Wolf howling ] Remember , watch out for night scorps . And Redeye . And nonpayment of debts . I tend to look at the big picture . Look , it 's real simple . We just have to keep a lookout for anything and everything . That 's all . You see anything in there besides your own reflection ? Something big . But I cannot quite make it out . [ Gunshot ] [ Zack ] Hit the deck ! [ Shouting ] Don 't touch me again . [ Chuckling ] What are you gonna do ? Poke me to death ? No . Just give you the finger . Aw , sweet dreams . [ Bork shouts ] [ Gunshots ] I 'm gonna get around in back of them . How are you gonna do that ? Ancient native tactic : Run like hell . [ Gunshots continue ] - I suggest you get the hell out of here , Zack ! - What about Mattie ? We 'll send her back when we 're done with her . I 'll slip out this way . [ Mattie screaming ] [ Yelling ] Mattie ! [ Redeye ] She 's in deep shit now , boy ! Night scorps might be scared of all this noise . But when they smell the blood , [ Smacks lips ] they 'll be no stopping them . [ Bork grunting ] Hmm . Don 't you ever point a finger at me again ! Never cared for handguns anyway . [ Yelling ] No ! [ Bork 's yelling continues ] [ Whimpering ] [ Roaring ] [ Mattie screaming ] It 's okay . It 's okay . Is it your leg ? Yes , it 's fine . - You know how to reload , Mattie ? - Yes . You 'll need this to keep the night scorps away . Zack , look , you 're out of ammo . Let him be . No way , Mattie . It ends here . [ Wolf howling ] - Oh , shit . - Everybody keeps hurting me ! Surprise ! Now , let 's see how you do with max power . [ Zack calling out ] Redeye ! Shit . [ Both scorps growling ] [ Redeye ] How do you like it , boy ? The latest in miniature energy blasters . So long , Marshall . A little slow on the draw . Like father , like son . Aah . Daconium . Turnaround 's fair play , isn 't it ? How does it feel knowing you gave up everything you believe- - all your dreams- - just to fight scum like me ? I 'm not fighting against you . I 'm fighting for them . Pretty words . Unfortunately , your last . [ Shouting ] Aah ! Aah ! [ Groaning ] - Gaunt ! - Ah , the hell with it . [ Screaming ] [ Shouting ] [ Growling , snarling ] What 's the matter , native , won 't fight back ? I do not hurt women . A man with integrity . I could go for you . Geronimo ! Even you hurt me ! Even you ! No . No . Oh , shit . I am in your debt still . If there 's anything I can do ... could you lend me a hand ? I thought you were only into ... funerals and bodies . There 's always bingo . Feels like it 's got the weight of the world hanging on it . You wear it well . Sure the scorps ate all of him ? Well , I mean , you know , no pieces left to regenerate ? Dead sure . You aren 't sorry , are you ? Well a piece of me died with him , but better him and me than innocent people . Let 's get on out of here . Heya .

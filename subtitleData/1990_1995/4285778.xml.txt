 It 's that time of year , when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike . The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart . Every day I strive to make that dream come true . I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze . The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter . If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide . Bright shining clouds drift by . Miku Practices Hard ! We 're here at the preliminary rounds for the championship for the All Japan Women 's Neo Wrestling World . No sooner than the seven leagues and free agents did the wrestlers begin this free for all . I 'm so glad I didn 't bring the girls down . Ms. Shibata if your Sapphire wins , it will mean a title rematch with Aquamarine . Would you like to comment ? Sapphire does retain the right to challenge her to a rematch . But the reason we chose to have an open tournament is to prove to the world that she is the true champion . The next time they meet , I guarantee that Sapphire will win . Hey Aquamarine , you and that belt belong to us , the Crushers . How rude . Come , let 's go , Aquamarine . Hey , are you running from the Crushers ? You ! Stop it . What do you think this championship is for ? If you 're true fighters , you 'll settle this in the ring . Aquamarine , the truth will come out in that ring . You just wait ! What if my girls get hurt fighting against monsters like that ? I think I blew it . Hey Boss ! How was registration ? A-Are you really going to go through with this ? Of course . And we intend to win too . Isn 't that right , guys ? Well , yeah . But this is different than the other fights . These people are the top of their leagues . You 've really got to be ready for this . Dear ! Are you still himming and hawing ? These girls have already made their minds up to do this ! I-I understand , Mother . So , whose our first fight against ? The CWP Crushers . What ? That team of gorillas ? Not bad for our first fight . Oh , so it 's not the Moonlight Jewels ? So , Sapphire gets off again . We can take the Crushers , no problem . Still , don 't slack off . I 've drilled the basics in to you girls , but you 're actual fighting experience is limited . So , I 've brought in a new coach . What , a new coach ? A new coach , what 's he like ? Is he handsome ? Is he tough ? Is he strong ? Hey , what are you doing ? What 's the matter , Kinta ? What 's the matter ? This guy came in out of nowhere and just passed out . W-Who is this drunk ? Where 's Masayo ? Masayo ? How is it that you know her well enough to use her first name ? It 's okay , Kinta . There you are , and here I am . I 'm all yours . We 've been waiting for you , Eiichi . Let me introduce you to Eiichi Suo , your new coach . No way ! This jerk ? Jerk , what do you mean ? N-Nothing . Got a problem ? You stink like booze . What a nasty smell . Yuck ! Well , you girls smell like piss . What did you say ? You want to be stronger , don 't you ? Of course , I want to be strong like Aquamarine . What 's so funny ? Those are awfully big dreams to be dreaming so early in the day . Why you ! Cut it out Ginko . Just ignore him . I 'll give him a good one , maybe that 'll sober him up . Ouch ! Don 't you even know how to fall ? How dare you do that to Ginko ! Nana ! S-Stop it , please . Don 't worry . You can 't even fall properly , but you whine about wanting to be strong ! If you want to get better , let 's see you take 2,000 falls ! 2,000 falls ? Can 't do it ? Little late for that , isn 't it ? Late , why ? The fall is the foundation of wrestling . Where do you get off thinking you can step into the ring , when you can 't even fall ? Can 't do it ? Then pack it in , ladies ! We can do it ! But this doesn 't mean we 've accepted you as our coach . Who says I 've decided to be your coach ? If you can 't prove that you have guts or skill , I 'll quit . You underestimate us ! What 's 2,000 falls ? Hold it ! Who said to do it dressed like that ? Put on your training gear ! Kid ! You keep track . Who are you calling kid ? My name is Kinta Marukome . Kinta . Okay . Ready . Okay , begin . Ouch ! I 'm not giving in . Shock impact 75 % . Damage 15 HP , energy , negative 20 ... E-Exactly . Shock impact 30 , Damage 0 . That 's what I want you to go for . And you ? Are you quitting ? This is why I hate old farts . Why us ? No bitching ! One thousand , nine hundred ninety eight . One thousand nine hundred ninety nine . Last one ... Go ! Two thousand . Finished ... I can 't move . My butt ! Are you okay ? How could we be okay ? I bet my butt 's all black and blue . Hey old man , wake up . They did it , 2,000 times . Finally finished ? Here , here 's the data for all 2,000 falls . Where the hell are you going ? He didn 't even look at the data and he 's already going out to get more booze ! You 've got to be kidding . What the hell is Ma thinking , bringing in a jerk ... What ! He 's Aqua Pudding 's old coach ? If you don 't even know who Aquamarine is , why are you surprised ? That was before she went off to America . Eiichi will get them in shape . What ? Are you serious ? Yeah , I heard them talking . I can 't believe it ... A drunk like him ? Aquamarine 's ... Oh my god , Aquamarine 's coach ! It 's a dream ! My back ! O-O-Ouch ! Let go of me , you drunk . Pitiful . Well , I do have to say you have guts attacking me after what happened to you yesterday . Damn . If you 've got that much energy , let 's see you do 3,000 squats ! No way , we 'll die ! Coach , we only have 10 days till the championship begins . Please teach us some new moves . New moves ? I want to be strong like Aquamarine . That 's some mouth you got . Not bad , not bad at all . If you want to be strong , let 's see you do 3,000 squats . Then you can continue your babbling ! Get going . One thousand fifteen . One thousand sixteen . One thousand seventeen . One thousand eighteen . One thousand nineteen . One thousand twenty . One thousand twenty one . One thousand twenty two . One thousand twenty three . One thousand twenty four . One thousand twenty five . One thousand twenty ... Who said you could take a break ? If you can 't hack it , you got no business trying to be a wrestler . You wanna get wet too ? One thousand twenty six . One thousand twenty seven . One thousand twenty eight . One thousand twenty nine . One thousand thirty , thirty one , thirty two , thirty three ... One more week . The tournament roster has been officially announced . I wonder if Sapphire will win and move on to fight for the belt ? Who knows what dark horse will come riding in . Is that your hunch ? I just think that would make it interesting . What 's the matter ? You 're shaking . Two thousand one ... Two thousand two ... Two thousand three ... Two thousand four ... Two thousand five ... Two thousand , nine hundred , ninety seven ... Two thousand , nine hundred , ninety eight .. Two thousand , nine hundred , ninety nine ... Three thousand ! You can finally do 3,000 squats without collapsing . That 's it for today , go take a shower . And , no practice tomorrow . Get some rest . And finally , the big day is here . And the tumultuous weather outside couldn 't be more appropriate . Howling winds . Driving Rain . Here we are at the Big Tokyo Dome in the midst of an off-season typhoon to bring you the opening of the first round of the All Japan Neo Women 's Pro Wrestling Universal Championship . Damn him ! That Eiichiro , one of these days I 'm going to get him ! You 're still going on about that ? Wow , I feel really light . Yeah , me too . Yeah ! All right , I 'm gonna pretend it 's Eiichiro , and kick the Crushers ' ass ! Let 's do it ! Here come the team members ! Put on your metal suits ! Sayaka ! Ginko ! Nana ! And the star of the Beauties , Pretty Miku ! Together we are the Pretty Four ! Dump ! Roller ! Crane ! Bull ! Crushers ! Ginko ! Run ! Run if you can ! One ... Two ... Thr- - You gorilla woman ! Ginko ! Swan Screw ! Now 's our chance ! Go Miku ! What ? That 's allowed ? Wow ! Roller 's big move ! A Frankenstiener from the top rope ! Pretty Miku is immobilized . Miku ! It 's the Jumping Needle Attack ! I know how to fall . Now it 's my turn ! One ... Two ... Three ... We won ! Yay ! Not bad . Quite an improvement from since her debut match . Eiichiro ... That explains it ... Caution ! Caution ! That is against the rules ! Shut up ! Let us go ! The winners of round one of the Neo Women 's Pro-Wrestling Championship is Pretty Four ! I 'm too old for this . I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile . Cheer up ! An angel without wings is just an ordinary person . Plain old hard work is more important than magic . In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest . Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats . Put your hands in your pockets . One day , they will come true the dreams that only you can dream . No matter how hard or bad it looks we always do fine in the ring . Hold it , hold it ! This isn 't good , who are you guys ? What do you want from us ? The Lady Ninjas ? Next time ... Miku 's Special Training . Miku 's Shockwave Punch !

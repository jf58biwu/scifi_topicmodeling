 MagnaVolt . The final word in auto security . No embarrassing alarm noise , no need to trouble the police and it won 't even run down your battery . On the international scene , the Amazon nuclear-power facility has blown its stack , irradiating the world 's largest rainforest . - Environmentalists call it a disaster . - But don 't they always ? In national news , the Attorney General today approved the ED-209 combat unit for deployment in five American cities despite widespread complaints of malfunction . The Surgeon General was gunned down 20 minutes ago by a militant addict of the deadly designer drug , Nuke . The greatest health threat facing our nation . Nuke . The most addictive narcotic in history . A plague that ... ( man ) Get some help ! ( assassin ) Nuke ! Nuke ! This station has just received this transmission from Cain convicted murderer and leader of the Nuke cult . People want paradise . And they will have it . The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by Cain following the firebombing of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead . Following a breakdown in negotiations Detroit 's police returned to the picket line , demanding better terms from OCP the corporation contracted by the city to run the Detroit Police Department . OCP cut our salaries 40 percent and cancelled our pensions and now they refuse to even talk to us . God knows why , but they want this strike . ( old woman mutters ) - ( woman wails ) - What happened ? ( woman sobs ) Hm . Ooh , look what he got . Yeah . ( chuckles ) Agh ! Get up . - Hold him . - Oh , you put my eye out , you bitches . Shut up , you fuckhead ! You 're breakin ' my fuckin ' arm ! Look at this . What a nasty man . Night 's made . Let 's pay papa and get us what we need . Nuke me , baby . - ( mugger ) I 'll kill you bitches ! - He 's up . Come on ! ( screaming ) - You 're shit with a timer , man . - Come on ! Let 's go ! I 'll take out an army with this shit . Let 's load up and get the hell outta here . Where 's the bullets for this gun , man ? Huh ? Third drawer , bottom . Wow ! We should have brought a truck . ( laughs ) - I really like this gun , man . - Then just take it and get out . Thanks . ( police sirens ) - I don 't believe this ! - What ? - It 's the cops , man . - Cops are on strike , stupid . Can 't you hear that ? ( police sirens ) - See ? What 'd I tell ya ? - I 'll fix him . ( robber laughs ) Did you see that ? We got him ! - Beautiful . Come on , man , let 's move . - No , one more ! Nice shit , man . Fucking cops ! ( laughs ) Peace officer . Think it over , creep . Nuke . It 's not mine , man . Where is it made ? It 's not mine , man , I told you . I 'm clean . Ow ! Where is it made ? I don 't know . All I know is where I get it . ( MUSIC salsa ) ( muffled voices ) ( baby cries ) ( music stops ) Freeze . Nobody move . This is a bust . ( women scream ) Ladies , stay down . ( speaks Chinese ) ( police siren ) ( man ) Somebody ! Open the fridge , damn it ! Can 't shoot a kid , can you , fucker ? ( distorted ) Can 't shoot a kid , can you ? Throw it home , Dad ! - ( baby cries ) - ( woman shouts in Chinese ) Shut up ! Drop it or she 's dead ! I 'll blow its fucking head off , man ! Lewis , hang it up . Now , no shit from either one of you . And don 't try to follow me . The baby 's goin ' with me ! - No . - I 'll kill it , man . I 'll do it . - I 'll fuckin ' kill it ! - We can 't have that . Nice shootin ' . - Hi , Mom . - Hi . Don 't do ... No , stop . Stop it . ( man ) OCP defines you as a machine that utilises some living tissue . You understand that ? Yes . And so , do you consider yourself human ? I require an answer . Stop tape . Do you have any idea what you 're doing to that poor woman ? Take a look at her file . Go on . ( lawyer ) Officer , Mrs Murphy is bringing suit against OCP . My name is Tom Delaney . I 'm representing her . Up to a few months ago , she wouldn 't leave her bedroom . Then there were the therapists and the hypnotists ... And then you pull this shit . Drivin ' past her house , day after day . Spyin 'on her . Tryin ' to make her think her husband is still alive . She 's barely started to accept the loss . You 're ripping her to pieces . And for what ? Do you think you could ever be a husband to her ? I mean , what can you offer her ? Companionship ? Love ? A man 's love ? No . Roll tape . Are you Alex Murphy ? No . Are you human ? No . You are simply a machine . I am ... a machine . Nothing more . Nothing more . That 'll do it . Stop tape . You stay there . All right , go get her . Let 's be decent about this . Give them some privacy . I don 't have a problem with that . Alex ? Don 't you know me ? Don 't you remember me ? Alex , it doesn 't matter what they 've done to you . Touch me . - It 's cold . - They made this to honour him . - No ... - Your husband is dead . I don 't know you . Why is this happening ? I thought all communication systems were the same . I tried to save the company a few bucks . It took two days to download specs from Cleveland . I lost the account . It hardly befits the dignity of my office to have to come to you . My apologies for the slight inconvenience . 20 minutes in rush-hour traffic isn 't slight . Not when you 're the mayor of a city . When are you gonna start paying the cops so they 'll go back to work ? We 're not a charity . The city owes us over 37 million dollars . - You 'll have to cut us some slack . - A deadline 's a deadline . How are we supposed to raise that kind of money ? You aren 't . - What the hell is he talkin ' about ? - We don 't expect you to pay . Let me refer you to our contract . 'In the event of default , OCP shall have the right of foreclosure on all city assets . ' - You signed this . - So you 're saying you can foreclose ? We can and we will . We 're taking Detroit private . So you deliberately undermined our credit . That was the easy part . And you engineered the police strike . You want Detroit to tear itself apart so you can raid it like you would any other corporation ? Do you know how many people are dying out there ? You 're murderers . I 'd advise you to say nothing further . It might be ... actionable . It 's bullshit ! Bullshit , you senile old bastard ! - It 's bullshit ! - We better get outta here . - I 'm OK . - Calm down . I think we 'd better leave . - Calm down . Easy , easy . - I 'm OK . - Right . Good . - I 'm in control . Everything is fine . It 's OK . I 'm fine . One last thing , gentlemen . - We will sue your asses . - Give it your best shot . Fuck you , you old senile bastard ! This is bullshit ! Fuck you ! It 's bullshit ! Damn bullshit ! I 've been very patient , Johnson . Five months . - Who 's that ? - Dr Juliette Faxx , just been moved up to head the Attitude Adjustment Team . - Five months . 19 million dollars . - I want to see some results . - Yes , sir . I 'll show you what we have . OCP pioneered cyborg technology , and now we take a quantum leap forward . State-of-the-art destructive capabilities commanded by a combination of software and organic systems . In every way , an improvement over the original . It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you RoboCop 2 . ( trumpets ) You are under arrest . Stop or I 'll shoot . Stop or ... OCP is proud to present the future of urban pacification . RoboCop 2 . ( trumpets ) Aaaagh ! ( crash ) 19 million . - They all go crazy . - Robots with emotional problems . No , sir , no , sir . Not robots - cyborgs . Cybernetic organisms . We use living , human tissue and that 's our whole problem . The candidates were all respected police officers . I reviewed their files myself . Sir , police officers may not be the best candidates for our purposes . They 're physical , macho , body-proud . Finding themselves stripped of all that , it 's no wonder they become suicidal . Our one success was a cop . Well , yes , Mr Johnson - Alex Murphy . Top of his class , devout Irish Catholic family man , everything in his profile indicates a fierce sense of duty . - That 's probably what kept him alive . - With all due respect your area of expertise is psychology , not robotics . There 's no harm in hearing the young lady out , is there , Johnson ? - No , sir . - Thank you , sir . I believe Murphy 's case was unusual , but not unique . We can find someone else . Someone to whom the prospect might even be ... desirable . I 've never met anyone who wanted to be a robot . It would require a screening process , one I 'd be happy to supervise . The cost would be negligible and it 'd be a shame to waste all the work that 's been done . It certainly would , my dear . Go to it . Report to me directly . Yes , sir . You could learn a thing or two from that girl , Johnson . ( demonstrators chanting ) Hey ! The union 's got a list . We ain 't forgetting ' who you are ! One at a time . One at a time . - It 's the best we can do . - Hello , ladies . Ah , ah , ah . I took out three of ' em , Leon . They won 't be fuckin ' with any more cops . They won 't be fuckin ' with nobody , man . ( coughs ) Oh ... Yeah . ( RoboCop ) Hob . That 's him . Nuke me . There 's plenty of Nuke to go around . I 've lost him . ( RoboCop ) Five degrees south-southwest . There 's the little darling . Good eyes , Murphy . Good as money can buy . Ferdy , you got out . Well , I 'll tell Cain , OK ? Better have something to give me this time , Officer . One cop per car . OK , these are the routes . Three cars . - One cop per car ? - That 's right . Sittin ' ducks . We set up three snipers and that 's all it takes . - Pay the man . - All right . - Thank you . - Hey , you didn 't count it . - That 's all right . - You should really count it , you know . It 's OK . Give him somethin ' to help him with his conscience . Ah , no , that 's all right . I don 't really want it . Come on , Duffy . I know you need it . ( MUSIC hard rock ) Isn 't this a school day ? ( man ) Cops ! ( whispers ) Hey ! Shit . Oh , no . Freeze . Turn around . Put your hands up . ( screaming ) Shit . Officer Duffy , have a seat . You look a little outta breath , bitch . You sold us out , Officer Duffy . - What are you talkin ' about , Murph ? - Where is Cain ? I don 't know any Cain . - No ! - Where is Cain ? I don 't know . Where is Cain ? I told ya , I don 't know ! Where ? River Rouge - the old sludge plant . You 're a rotten cop . Go . - ( RoboCop ) You . - You want me ? ( RoboCop ) Dead or alive . - Then one of us must die . - Dead , then . Jesus had days like this . Hounded and attacked , like a criminal . But , like him , I don 't blame you . They programme you and you do it . I will kill you . You just tried . And ... I forgive you . Argh ! - Why 'd you stop ? You got it cracked . - I 'm tired . They say he 's got a brain . I wanna see it . You think it was me that beat you ? It wasn 't . It was this . ( drilling ) It 's too tough . Try here , at the joint . Yeah . Ha ! Look at that ! Hey ! Come on , cut it out . - How 's it taste ? - Argh ! What the hell 's goin ' on ? Man , just look at him . Christ , he 's been stripped . Let 's get him inside . Let 's not get carried away . We 're talking about a piece of equipment . Don 't tell me he can 't suffer . Just look at him . It 's ... it 's electrical . Bullshit . I know every inch of him , every circuit , every living nerve . His pain centres are alive . They 're lit up like Christmas trees . The backup generator 's just makin ' him twitch . He 's suffering . How long can he last ? No way of knowing . Got him on minimal life support . Keeping the brain going with microshocks . It 's damn tricky . Could be goin ' any time . Move , move ! - What 's happening in here ? - OCP is happening . These bastards won 't lift a finger to help him . This unit needs millions of dollars in parts . You can 't expect authorisation for that overnight . Be reasonable . - If you don 't fix him , it 's murder . - I 'm doin ' you a favour just talkin ' to you . You son of a bitch . He 's in hell . I 'll be in touch . ( Duffy ) Oh , man . You guys are the greatest . Did you see their faces ? 'We 're gonna throw away the key , Duffy . ' The cops didn 't give you too much trouble ? Usual shit from Reed . They 'll never prove anything . Hey , want some ? Hey , I 'm a minor . Don 't wanna break any laws . Here , you take it . God , I just love you guys ! What happened ? Where we goin ' ? Hey , come on , guys . This isn 't funny , man . Oh , God , my head . My head 's so killing ' me . Wait a minute . Hey , Cain . Hey , it 's ... it 's good to see ya . Thanks for gettin ' me out . - I can 't get up . - We noticed that one . - I don 't know what that kid told you ... - You told them where we were . - That 's not true . - ( Hob ) We know all about it , Duffy . You think you 're the only cop we have ? Holy shit ! Cain , Cain ... I 'm begging you , man . Look , I 'll do anything . OK . You 're kiddin ' , right ? Yeah , you 're just kiddin ' . Oh , you scared me . Oh , you taught me a lesson , man . I 'd never fuck with you , because I really love you guys . I really do . - Shut up . - Look , I 've been loyal . I know shit that I still haven 't even told you , Cain . You deserve this , Duffy . Cain might have been killed . - OK , OK . - Maybe you oughta have the kid leave ? - Why ? - What ? We oughta have the kid leave ? That 's a good touch . That 's a good touch . Have the kid leave . 'Have the kid leave . ' ' Why ? ' Come on , please . It 's over . Come on , Cain . Come on , man , what are you doin ' ? No ! No , come on . Agh ! ( screaming ) You said you were just gonna scare him ! Doesn 't he look scared ? ( screaming ) - I can 't believe you 're contemplating this . - It hardly matters what you believe . But these are criminals . Maniacs . You 're given to premature value judgements . All right , it may be true . The subjects are socially misaligned . Socially misaligned ? These are death-row inmates . And of no use to society . We need a subject who 'll welcome the power the virtual immortality we offer . Now , I really think this is a good place to start looking . You 're out of your mind . Is that your professional opinion ? Yes , goddamnit , it is , yes . And you are not using my lab to put that kind of a brain into my cyborg . We 'd dearly miss you here . You 're the one that 's gonna be out of a job . I 'm gonna take this directly to Johnson . He 's just been waiting for an excuse to get you fired . Good morning , sir . I 'm sorry to bother you this early . - You seem agitated . - Well , frankly , I 'm shocked . Mr Schenk just called . Dr Faxx has begun screening candidates for RoboCop 2 . So I understand . - It 's very exciting . - She 's screening psychotics . Murderers . Well , we aren 't planning to build a toy , Johnson . - Faxx knows what she 's doing . - She 's keeping RoboCop off line . It 's a public relations disaster . You 've got to learn to look at the larger picture , the foreclosure . You must know how important that is to us . With RoboCop out of commission , the chaos down there will increase . So will the odds that the city will fall into our hands . Yes , but a competent executive would find a way to deal with the corporate image problem . - Couldn 't agree with you more . Fortunately , I have found a way . Yes , Miss Faxx and I have already discussed it . I know you 'll help to implement her ideas . - Of course , sir , whatever I can do . - Anything else ? - Coffee ? - No , thank you . Don 't forget your shoes on the way out . ( grunts ) - He 's my patient . I have to stay with him . - We 'll let you know when we need you . Nobody on your staff has my experience with him . You need me . - We don 't need anybody . - ' We ' ? Who the hell are ' we ' ? You 're a lawyer ! You know nothing about him ! You 're exactly this far from gettin ' fired , babe . Shyster ! He 's one of mine . I want him back on his feet . Well , maybe he will be , or maybe we 'll just sell the parts for scrap . That 's up to us . You see , RoboCop 's off warranty . RoboCop 's command programme , his set of directives it determines his behaviour . It 's time to update the programme and well , I would like to hear from each one of you . ( whispers ) It 's about time they asked us . Well , we 're getting a lot of heat from the parents ' groups . Personally , I don 't blame them - I 'm a parent myself . All that destructive behaviour - he 's become a role model for our children . - Now , what are we teaching them ? - You have a point . If he 'd just talk things out with people , instead of firing that big gun of his . Couldn 't he take time to address environmental issues ? - Excuse me , what was that ? - He could speak out on the environment . - Don 't see any reason why not . - For all the shooting he does I 've never once seen him take the time to do anything nice like visit an orphanage . ( Johnson ) You 're absolutely right . Or help a cat out of a tree or go collecting for the Red Cross or maybe even roasting some marshmallows with some Cub Scouts ( ! ) Why , Mr Johnson , that is wonderful . Thank you so much ( ! ) - The programme isn 't uploading . - He 's resisting . - There 's too much data . - No , it 's him . Leave him to me . It 's not going to work ! You 're wasting valuable time . Don 't resist us . Let me up . I must go . Go where ? Hm ? Do what ? Go dancing ? Fall in love ? What is it you think you are ? Alex Murphy . That 's a delusion . It 's a glitch in your system . Alex Murphy is dead . You take away the plastic and metal and wires and you 're just a couple of chunks on a coroner 's table . You 're not even a corpse . What are you ? Respond . I am Officer Alex Murphy , Detroit Police Department . That won 't do . What are you ? RoboCop , Crime Prevention Unit . OCP . Better , much better . - I type it , you think it . - You type it , I think it . What a wonderful opportunity you represent . Psychotherapy , it 's such a ... it 's a slow , clumsy practice but with you , this is so simple , direct . You 're very lucky . We can do in moments with you what would take years with a human patient . I 'm really very lucky . You 're free . You 're free from doubt , free from having to make painful choices . I am free . He 's ready . Uploading command programme . I am so glad we had this chance to dialogue . Look at you , it 's like you 're brand new . - Thank you , thank you . - You really had us worried there , Murphy . - I 'm touched . - Get this guy . He 's touched . That 's enough . All of you , back to your posts . Come on . Let 's go . - How you feeling , Murphy ? - I 'm just fine , Warren . Thank you for asking . Let 's get you downstairs . I wanna see what those amateurs at OCP screwed up . Pity . It 's a beautiful morning . Shame to waste it . - Ready for duty , partner ? - You betcha . - Let 's go . - Nothing I 'd rather do . - He sounds terrific . - Something 's wrong . ( breaking glass ) Harder ! ( police siren ) It 's Robo ! Everybody out the back door ! - It 's locked ! - It won 't open ! Murph , wake up , will ya ? Good morning . ( Lewis ) Come on , take him out . Murph . I think we should talk . What 's with you , Murph ? - Where 'd they go ? - Where 'd they go ? They 're still here . The little bastards . Hands up . Let 's go . Everybody up . Move it . Up against the wall . Let 's go . Hands on top of your heads . Nobody move . You are under arrest . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . - He 's dead . - You have the right to an attorney . You 're reading Miranda to a corpse . I 'm having trouble . Oh , my ! This isn 't very nice . Though you may think you are having fun now you only hurt the one you love . Think of Mom and Dad . What kind of lesson are you teaching them ? And now a word on nutrition . Shit ! He 's fucked up . Bad language makes for bad feelings . - Let 's go . - The point is , we all have to work . I haven 't finished . Hit the gas , Murphy . The posted limit is 35 . We should set an example , Anne . Your hair looks lovely that way . It 's OCP . They did something to you . I 'm fine . Isn 't the moon wonderful tonight ? - It 's still daytime . - It 's the thought that counts . Oh , Jesus , we 're heading back to the station , that 's all there is to it . What the hell are you doing ? Waste makes haste for time is fleeting . A rolling stone is worth two in the bush . Go fuck a refrigerator , pecker neck ! Bad language makes for bad feelings . You 're nuts ! ( laughter ) Murphy , come on , let 's go . Come on . Back ! Thank you for not smoking . Well , there it is . It 's OCP . - They screwed him up . - He must be goin ' out of his mind . It 's not as if he can just say no . They 've put all this nonsense into his brain . - He has to obey . - Take them out , all of them . Can 't be done , not with this equipment . Are you saying there 's no way ? I can 't believe that . Well , sure , there are ways . You can pull his cranial circuits . Which would shut down his life-support system . Could run a few thousand volts through him , pray his insulation holds . Probably kill him . - Let go ! - I 'll get some help . - Get him inside . - Come on , move it ! Don 't touch him , he 's hot ! Use your jackets . - Why did he do that ? - OCP gave him crazy commands . Fried himself to get rid of them . He weighs a ton . He sure does . - Get out of the way . - Move out ! - Think he 's alive ? - I don 't know . Put me down . Are we cops ? - What 's buggin ' you , Murph ? - Cain . Cain 's bugging me . ( Cain ) We have only just begun , my flock . Soon , we will expand from city to city . The rich and the poor alike will know a paradise for every moment of their lives . There 's a Nuke for every mood . We 'll offer our customers the opportunity to control every aspect of their emotional lives . With the white noise and the black thunder , the red ramrod and the the blue velvet . Frank , the blue velvet ? I think it 's ready , sir . Thank you , Frank . Frank , the Benzedrine 's got my teeth wiggling . Cut it with scopolamine . - Five mils per . - Yes , sir . Made in America . Yeah , we 're gonna make that mean something again . Hey , cops ! Cops ! And they ain 't carrying ' no picket signs . They going to kick somebody 's ass . ( gunfire ) ( gunfire ) Give me your hand , goddamnit ! Christ . Fuck ! Bomb ! Get out ! Bomb ! Get down ! 500 million in cash . Nuke money , seized by police . But the state attorney won 't let the bankrupt city government touch it . Coming up next : Threats from the police union and cheers from the public as Metro North cops go back to work and apprehend the Nuke lord , Cain who may not live to stand trial . They say 20 seconds in the California sunshine is too much these days ever since we lost the ozone layer . But that was before Sun Block 5000 . Just apply a pint to your body and you 're good for hours . See you by the pool . Sun Block 5000 . Protection for the New Age . Subject is violently antisocial , given to delusions of godhood and is hopelessly addicted to narcotics which offers us a simple and infallible method of ensuring his obedience . Hm . You 're perfect . I must have you . What are you talking about ? It 's like you don 't even care . - Just do what I say , Angie . - He 'd want us to come for him . Just forget it . It 's not gonna happen . I 'm through arguing with you . I 'm not asking for your permission . Cain is in a hospital and we 're gonna get him . You 've really thought this out now , haven 't ya ? What about the cops ? We 've got guns . Damn it , Hob , Cain needs us ! Fuck Cain ! - He 'd kill you if he heard that . - He 's not gonna kill anybody . - You heard the news . He 's probably dead . - You shut the hell up ! You mouth off like that again and it 's no more Nuke for you , bitch . Damn it , Hob , you know that 's not fair . Now , come on . It 's been a bad time . Sure has . You 're really hurtin ' . - Yes , so I 'm hurting . - Gonna get the shakes soon , Angie . You got it bad . You little bastard . You just do what I tell you from now on , Angie . Start the motor and drive . He 'll kill you . He 'll kill us both . Fuck him . Oh , you 're a mess . I got good news for you . You 're gonna have a chance for immortality as long as nothing happens to that lovely brain . Dr Weltman ? It 's Faxx . I 'm afraid we lost our patient . Yeah , he just expired . Contact the organ harvest team . We 've got six minutes before the brain 's useless . Night . ( Weltman ) Come on , come on . Let 's move it . We 've only got five minutes . Lock it up . - Temperature ? - ( nurse ) Optimum . ( Weltman ) Move the screen in a little closer . I can 't read it . - ( surgeon ) How 'd we get this one ? - ( Weltman ) Well , Faxx found him . He volunteered . ( surgeon ) Volunteered ? Big-hearted guy . Yeah . It 's not the heart we 're after , though . ( surgeon ) Speaking of hearts , how 's llene ? Christ , does everybody know ? Hold your breath . Now it 's showtime . It 's nice and clean in here . There 's no damage . Well ... here we go . Easy . ( surgeon ) We got it . Here it comes . - Thing of beauty . - Excellent . ( Weltman ) I don 't know about the rest of you , but I 'm hungry . ( plays ' Born to be Wild ' ) Thank you , thank you . Yes , yes ! Spider Baby Stalirski . He 's come out for Detroit and now you come out for him . The lines are open , waiting for your pledge . If you want an honest government , a government that works for you I 'm asking you to dig deep into your pockets . I 'm asking you to give whatever you can spare . Where does that put us , Gilly ? ( phone rings ) Hi . Yes , ma 'am . Hello , this is Mayor Kuzak . Could you turn down your set , please ? Your Honour I have some very good news for you . I think the city is saved . Now you listen very carefully . Oh , it 's no bluff . Someone 's shown up to bail the city out . - A rival corporation ? - The mayor isn 't saying and whoever it is is taking great pains to keep their identity a secret . They 're paying in cash and they 're not moving the money through the banks . Thank you , Councilman . That will be all . You know , once you guys take over ... Your services to OCP will be rewarded . - If the city can pay , we 'll be humiliated . - I think it 's worse than that , sir . We shifted 80 percent of our liquid resources to the urban pacification plan . If we can 't foreclose , public confidence in OCP will plummet and so will our stock . Sir , if I may ? There 's another option . We certainly have the surveillance capabilities to follow the mayor . It all depends on how far we 're willing to go . If anything went wrong ... As I said , sir , it all depends how far we 're willing to go . We have no legal recourse . There must be no witnesses . - You 've gone too far ! - Think of your blood pressure . You can get me fired . You are not bringing illegal drugs into my lab ! I would do worse than get you fired . Now , leave me alone . Such terrible pain . You don 't remember me . But you do remember this , don 't you ? And we have it . All the Nuke you 'll ever need . Ah , ah , ah , ah ! Not so fast . I need you to do something for me first . Then the pain stops . Good boy . I don 't like this . I think we 'd better get outta here while we can . I know what I 'm doing . If you have any cash , put it in your shorts . That 's just plain rude . I wonder if any of you could help me ? I 'm looking for a Mr Hob . So , how much you need ? - Money , I mean . - Well , our current debt to OCP is ... Bob ? $ 37,480,911 . Guess you 're in some pretty deep shit . We need all the help we can get , young man . Tell you what , put me down for 50 just to make sure . 50 cents ? 50 dollars ? That 's cute . Don 't be a queer . 50 million . This is bullshit . Let 's get outta here . Good God . Gentlemen ? Well ? Will 50 do it ? Oh , yes , yes , that 'll do it . - Don 't you guys think that 'll do it ? - Yeah . 50 mill . That will do it . For God 's sake , these people are criminals . Why do you have to label people ? I hate labels . You shut up . But we cannot capitulate in the war on crime . I 'd be voted outta office , and I don 't think anyone wants that . War on crime 's fine with us . It 's business we 're talkin ' about here . Do you have any idea how many people we employ ? You know , I ... I never thought about it like that . Sharp kid . So , your war on crime , you wanna win it or what ? We 're the only chance you have . Listen to him . He 's got it all worked out . Why do people do crimes ? Why drugs . People do drugs . Because they want drugs . The kind that cost too much . Nuke gives high quality at a cheap price . - If you get off our backs , it 'll be cheaper . - And safer . We don 't go shoving ' our shit down anybody 's throat . And we don 't advertise it like they do with cigarettes or booze . So leave us alone and anybody who wants it , gets it . So no more crimes . You get to be the mayor who cleaned up Detroit . He 's got a point . - Don 't you think he 's got a point ? - Yeah , he 's got a point . What the hell is that ? Get out ! - Marv ... - Shh ! Agh ! Cain . Oh , wow ! ( growls ) You look great . ( Angie ) Oh . Oooh ! It 'll take some getting used to , but it 'll be great , Cain . ( growls ) Agh ! ( police siren ) ( Hob groans ) Lie still . - I 'm cold . - You are going into shock . I will call for a medical emergency unit . Wait . No . Don 't leave me . I won 't leave you . - Who did this ? - It was big . Bigger than you . It was Cain . I 'm gonna die . You know what that 's like , don 't you ? It really sucks . ( whispers ) Yes . ( TVpresenter ) 13 dead in what appears to be a Nuke-money massacre . Among the victims , two city councilmen . Was the city trying to strike a deal with the drug lords ? No comment ! I said I have no comment ! Now , no comments on these allegations . These were men who served this city tirelessly . However , I make a promise to the people of Detroit City that no effort will be spared to investigate this thoroughly . - But Mr Mayor ... - I 'm sorry . No more questions . ( TV presenter ) Our own Mayor Kuzak . Now let 's go live to Jess . ( Jess ) And here it is , the Civic Centrum , OCP 's 100-storey gift to the Motor City . While debate continues over OCP 's hostile takeover there 's no denying the mood here is festive . Citizens interviewed on the scene expressed excitement and hope that OCP will make good on its promise of a better life in Detroit . - Press . - Sorry , folks , media only . TV and press only . You 'll have to step back . ( woman ) There he is ! - Can OCP bring industry back to Detroit ? - Can a corporation own the government ? - Are you gonna hold elections ? - Why aren 't you going to City Hall ? Just a minute . I 'll answer that , young lady . City Hall is the decaying symbol of mismanagement and corruption . You get that ? This magnificent structure will be the seat of leadership for the new Detroit . And what better place for a clean , fresh start ? And so , people of the press , city officials in a few minutes , Omni Consumer Products and the troubled city of Detroit will join in a bold new venture . Now , I 'd like to explain just what this will mean . Sometimes we just have to start over from scratch , to make things right . And that 's exactly what we 're going to do . We 're going to build a brand new city , where Detroit now stands an example to the world . ( trumpets ) ( applause ) My friends , welcome to our city as it should be and as it will be , in the hands of responsible private enterprise . And a special welcome to Mayor Kuzak and the outgoing administration . Oh , we 're not goin ' anywhere . Your Honour . You 'll have to tear down a lot of people 's houses to make that . You 're gonna take away their homes . We 're going to raise towers of glass and steel . Every citizen will have a living unit , safe , secure and clean . - Now , please , take your seat . - Won 't be room for neighbourhoods . Not like the kind that we all grew up in . These days neighbourhoods are places where bad things happen . - Don 't be nostalgic . - And democracy ? Nobody elected you . Anyone can buy OCP stock and own a piece of our city . What could be more democratic than that ? Well , there are a lot of people in this town that can 't afford to buy your stock ! And they 're not gonna let you get away with this . You haven 't been following the polls . Sit down . About a year ago we gave this city RoboCop . I think he 's worked out pretty well but things have become a little rougher out there . Now we need a law enforcement unit capable of meeting the enemy on his own ground and carrying enough fire power to get the job done . ( trumpets ) Ladies and gentlemen with great pleasure I give you RoboCop 2 . - Bastards ! Maniacs ! - What 's the matter ? I can 't believe it . It was them ! They sent it ! - Sent what ? - Nothin ' . There 's going to be a big call for this unit and we 'll make him right here in Detroit . That means jobs we can all be proud of and make ' Made in America' mean something again . ( applause ) This single container holds enough Nuke to addict a city block . A hundred of these are produced every day and sent to sweatshops where urban slaves prepare this poison for our friends , our loved ones , our children . Now I say it 's high time we put an end to this plague . RoboCop 2 will seek out every laboratory , every dealer and rid our city of Nuke . Ah , yes , things will be a lot quieter with this boy around . - What 's wrong with him ? - It 's nothing . It 's nothing at all . - Turn him off . - I can 't . ( RoboCop ) Cain , let 's step outside ! You ! Get outta here ! You 're obsolete ! That thing is a killer ! - It 's not even armed . It 's harmless . - It 's a killer and I saw it ! - Get her out of here , now ! - Let me go ! No ! Behave yourselves ! - What 's the deal here ? - It sounds like there 's a war going on . You 're coming with me , Cain . ( screaming ) Are you jealous of the replacement ? ( man ) Take him out ! This could look bad for OCP , Johnson . Scramble the best spin team we have . ( man ) Ammo ! Ammo ! Get down ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire , damn it ! All right , let 's get him outta here . Watch his neck . He 's hurt bad . Easy . Shit ! - I gotta get back . - Movin 'back , movin ' back . ( screaming ) Let 's give him what he wants . Goodbye . It 's serious trouble , so many dead and wounded . - There won 't be trouble from the dead . - They 'll have relatives , they always do . - It 'll be a feeding frenzy . - It 's only money . - What about criminal proceedings ? - Well , we 're looking at major indictments . - Prison terms . - What about me ? - You know we 'll do whatever we can . - That 's not good enough . Sir , what if this was all the work of one individual ? A person with her own agenda that wasn 't in sync with the goals of our company ? Well , that usually works . A woman who was not a team player , who violated our trust ? Well , we 'd need some evidence to support that . Sir , whether it exists or not , I know I can find it . She did choose the brain , sir . - Good thinking . - Sir . Thank God you 're all right . I was so worried . - I thought it was going to hurt you . - No , no . It 's over . It 's all over . - I failed you . - Don 't be hard on yourself . Everything is going to be all right . Johnson , that business we were talking about - get right on it . Yes , sir . Just look at what they 've done . They are criminals . OCP won 't own this city for long . I 'll see to that . I will take it to the streets , to the people . Is this what it 's come to ? Businessmen can buy our rights like stock ? You don 't realise what we 're losing ! - Give us a statement , sir . - Sir , we have dozens dead . Is this your idea of a better life ? That monster was crazy . How did this happen ? How do you account for this disaster ? Will OCP make reparations to the victims ? That son of a bitch is getting away with it . We can 't even touch him . Patience , Lewis . We 're only human .

 [ â ™ ª music â ™ ª ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new on earth found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent ... he learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind He is Superboy . [ thunder and lightning ] Daddy , can we play the game ? I want a teddy bear . I want to see the funhouse . Told you this would happen , Oh , give them the money . What are we gonna do about getting the car fixed . Dave , we hardly ever go out . Daddy , I want some ice cream . [ all ] Yeah . [ all ] All right . [ child 1 ] Can we play the games , Mommy ? [ child 2 ] I want some ice cream . [ child 1 ] Hurry . [ child 1 ] You 're gonna get lost . [ child 2 ] No , I 'm not . Where 'd everybody go ? Kids ? Honey . - Hey . - [ man ] Yes . How 'd you do that ? I can do anything . And I know everything . ... even about the wallet . The wallet ? You couldn 't resist that , could you ? Was the temptation too great ? It ... it was like I was supposed to take it . But if you want the money ... No , no , no , no , no . You keep that . That 's a small price to pay for what I 'm going to get from you . What are you going to get ? What am I going to get ? Your eternal soul . [ screaming ] Port Arthur , Texas two years ago . Four people missing . Plainview , Illinois . Four years ago six people missing . Texarkana , Arkansas ... Lana , what are you trying to prove ? It 's simple . Wherever the carnival goes , people end up missing . Yeah , but do you have anything tying it to the carnival ? Well , no . I ... Lana , I bet people disappear every time the Grateful Dead do a concert . I checked all the way back to the Lynchburg Gazette . A hundred and eight years ago . Come on , Devill can 't be that old . Only Jerry Garcia is that old . Same name three people missing . But these little carnivals , they 've been around forever . And Devill ? The name 's practically a clichÃ © . Well what can it hurt just to check it out . It can hurt plenty . I 've had a full day . I need my rest . Fine . Rest then . Lana . Oh , worried . Maybe I 'm not so crazy after all , huh ? . No , no , you 're crazy as ever . I was just thinking that maybe you 'd have a better time if you didn 't have to go there alone . It 's OK , Clark is going too . And when he gets here , will you tell him to meet me there ? If he ever gets here . Have you ever wondered why he 's always late ? I just think he tries to put too much into his schedule . [ police siren ] [ whimpering ] Are you all right ? So you got me . So what ? So you 're going to jail . Jail ? That 's a joke . I 've been in and out of jail since I was a kid . I know more about the system than most judges do . Well , this time 's gonna be different . Says who ? I 'm nuts man . I 'm crazy . Ask her . She wasn 't the first . And she won 't be the last . I 'll get a little more time with the shrinks . But they 're dumber than the police . You can 't do anything can you but stand there and look stupid ? Let me tell you something man to man . She was asking for it . Let me tell you something else . She was loving it . [ laughter ] Superboy . Thanks . You make it look easy . Yeah , easy . I 'll see you again , superhero . [ Lana ] Mr. Devill ? I just wanted to tell you how much I 'm enjoying the carnival . Really . Oh , it 's only a modest little show . But thank you anyway , I think it 's great . How long have you had it . Just a few years . Seems as though I 've been travelling forever . You must meet a lot of interesting people . That 's exactly why I bought it . To find out about human nature . To see what people really want . And what do they want ? Oh , the usual . Money , love , power , fame . But some people are curious . They want to bite the apple . The apple ? Remember when the serpent tempted Eve . She gave in . Uh huh . Many people think that 's when paradise was lost . But I think ... a whole new world opened up . And it 's all in here . It 's all in here . All the mysteries , all the secrets . It 's right in here . But you have to be willing to look for yourself . I can 't force you . It has to come from within . Come look . Maybe later . [ chuckles ] Excuse me , have you seen a redhead about five foot seven ? Won 't I do ? [ woman laughs ] Hit him . Hit him . Punch him . Hey , stop . You guys shouldn 't fight . Now hit him back . Hit him . [ bell dings ] Lana . It happened again . What did ? Somebody 's missing . Everywhere this carnival goes , people just disappear . Well , what did the police say ? They told that woman that she had to wait 24 hours before she could even file a missing persons report on her 24 hours ? [ crowd noise ] [ â ™ ª music â ™ ª ] [ man ] Hey , four eyes . Think you can dunk me ? Not now . Free shot for a buck . No , thanks . You probably throw like a girl . I don 't but I have other things to do right now . Like what ? Going to buy some cotton candy . Perfect food for you . Soft and pink . Give it a shot . Come on . Chop me up . No . You 're just doing your job . Looking for someone ? I guess that 's pretty obvious . I would have known anyway . I know everything . Nobody knows everything . I do . Then maybe you can tell me who I 'm looking for and where he is . That is trivial . Not to his family . I have more important things to tell you about . - What could be more important than ... Me ? I can tell you many things about yourself . I already know about myself . Do you ? Do you know where you 're from ? Why you 're here ? You can tell me that ? If you come inside . And let me see your palm . I , I don 't think so . Well , you 're very strong aren 't you ? And you 've hidden it for a long time . [ screaming ] What 's in there ? Don 't they look familiar ? They 're liars , thieves , adulterers . People who couldn 't avoid temptation . People like you . These are their souls . The people who disappeared . All safe and sound . Right in here . This is my collection . My ... My source of power . Who are you ? Oh , I think you know the answer to that by now . Don 't be afraid . It 's not your soul I 'm after . It 's your friend 's . You want to know who you are ? The answer is right inside . [ Lana ] Help me ! [ â ™ ª music â ™ ª ] Help . Lana . [ muffled voice ] See , I was right . I told you I 'd bust out and I did . [ laughing ] And I said there 'd be another one . And now there is . Should have killed me when you had the chance . There are plenty chances left . Now you 're talking . [ Lana screams ] She gonna live ? How about one or two more minutes with her ? Is this is ? Are you gonna finish it ? You deserve it . You 're right . There 's only one way to stop me . Go on . Do it . Kill me . There 's no cop to stop you this time . It wasn 't the cops that stopped me . You gotta do it . Do it . It 's not my style . You knew , didn 't you ? You knew . It doesn 't matter . You almost killed . Almost . Stop him . [ screaming ] [ Lana ] Superboy . Lana , you all right ? You beat him . He wanted to take your soul , but he , he couldn 't tempt you . I got lucky . No , no , no , no , no . It wasn 't luck . Think of all those people that gave in . You should give yourself more credit . You should be proud . Well , I never thought of ... Say it . Say you 're proud for once . You really want me to say that , don 't you ? You got to take pride . But pride 's a sin . Isn 't it ? You 're smart . But one day , I 'll be back for you . [ laughter ] Not if I can help it . [ laughs ] [ â ™ ª music â ™ ª ]

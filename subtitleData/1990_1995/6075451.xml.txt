 [ groaning ] I knew he 'd run . Figuratively speaking , of course . He won 't be coming back either . This thing blankets the city with ultra high-frequency sound . [ laughing ] He won 't be able to . Looks like Capitol City is our own personal candy jar , eh , pal ? Yeah ... pal . No , it isn 't . Not yet . Superboy has to die first . That 's why I brought you together . And , it has to be slow .. ... and painful . Are you sure , you want her ? - Hm , with all of my heart . - You don 't have a heart . I got everything else . Ugh ! [ pleasant music ] [ heavy metal music on radio ] [ music continues ] [ buzzing ] [ knocking on door ] [ lowering volume ] ( Lana ) Hello ? Clark ? What are you doing here ? I got to thinking about what you were saying and .. ... it made a lot of sense . Sit . I had figured you 'd come around . Did you hear what Superboy did ? Yeah , I heard . He did the right thing . Leaving Capitol City ? I 'm not so sure . After all he has done I think it 's about time he let the police do their job . Yeah . I assume that unless your parents have acquired a taste for loud heavy metal music , they 're not at home ? They were gone when I got here . They were going to the State capital for few days . Because of what 's been happening in town , right ? - What 's been happening ? - You don 't know ? Huh , well , allow me to show you . It has been unbelievable . It is fantastic . I got tourists coming in from the Midwest . The locals are lining up . The place is going crazy . It 's gonna be another Vegas . - You watch me . - No , it 's not . Not if I can help that . Excuse me . Do I know you ? Lana Lang . I used to live here . Bill Trenton . I think you have me confused with somebody else . No , no . You 're responsible for this . If by this you mean revitalizing Smallville 's economy then , yes , I 'm responsible . No , I mean , turning it into a cesspool . Look . Ha-ha-ha , Lana . I know the concerns of the locals and I 'm gonna respect them . Everything is totally up and up . Everything is totally above void here , okay ? There is even a $ 100 a day limit . Nobody 's gonna get burned here . What about the bars , topless clubs and X-rated theaters you wanna build ? We 've been to the city planners- - Alright . Hold it . Wait a second , okay ? This place would be a ghost town . Nothing but foreclosed farms and families on welfare . The town needed money fast , this is how you get it . There are other ways . Hey , Miss Lana ? What 's it to you ? You don 't even live here anymore , do you ? [ shot gun firing ] [ people screaming ] [ shot gun firing ] They stole my money . Every cent of it . [ shot gun firing ] Listen , pal . We 've had this discussion and you take care of this thing quick . Don 't make me do something you 're gonna regret , clear ? Roy , put the gun down . You 're all crooks . They ain 't crooks . You just don 't know beans about poker , that 's all . Now put the gun down before somebody gets hurt . I 'll tell you who 's gonna get hurt . My family ! [ dramatic music ] ( Roy ) I gotta mortgage due . Why don 't you tell me where my family is gonna go , huh ? [ Superboy theme music ] You stay away from me . You don 't wanna do that . - I 've lost everything . - It isn 't worth it . It 's only a few hundred dollars . Few hundred ? Try a few thousands . They have limits . Every place has got limit . When you hit it in one place , the next place will be happy to take it to the limit again . Around $ 6000 in two weeks . Roy , they were wrong . But this isn 't the way- - This is the only way . [ shot gun firing ] [ sighs ] [ people applauding ] - Bye . - Wait ! How long are you gonna be staying here ? I don 't know . You 're not going back to Capitol City , are you ? - I have to . - No. you don 't . Well , you know me better than that . What if I had told you I 'd be staying here . Are you ? Would it change anything ? I gotta go . He 's gonna ruin everything . I gotta do something . Listen , after what just happened maybe , you should think about closing up for a while . Maybe you should think about finding another job . If you can 't handle things around here I 'm gonna have to find someone who can . [ people chattering ] [ dramatic music ] What a dump ! [ dramatic music ] [ Rock music playing on radio ] [ knocking on door ] [ knocking on door ] Clark ? Clark ! [ music continues ] I don 't remember you listening to that kind of music . I don 't remember you ever coming into someone 's house without knocking first , but here you are . Luthor and Odessa are here . We have to warn Superboy , make him leave Smallville . He ran from them once . He won 't do it again . How do you know ? How do you know what he 's thinking ? It 's logical . Where 's he gonna go ? Where ever he goes , they 're gonna follow him . This has got to end here ! [ utensils clanking ] Clark . All we have to do is give them time . What ? Luthor , Metallo , Odessa . They 're egomaniacs , psychotics . They 'll turn on each other sooner or later . What if it 's later ? Clark , you should know them by now . [ sighs ] ( Lana ) What ? What is it ? The ripples in the water . They 're like sound waves . So ? ( Clark ) The ripple from is interfering with the ripple from the first . It 's like sound . One set of sound waves could cancel out the other . You know you are absolutely right . You 've gotta go and warn Superboy . Okay . Wh-wh-where will I find them ? I don 't know . He 's gotta be around somewhere . Okay . What are you gonna be doing ? Oh , never mind . I 'm gonna take a stand . [ dramatic music ] Can 't do it , Lana . Why can 't you just go down there and arrest him ? It 's better if you just stay out of it . For who ? Not for Superboy . For Smallville . Don 't get yourself in the middle of this . I 'm not in the middle . You just need to pick a side . [ car horn honking ] Yoo-hoo ! Yippee ! Howdy , partner ? [ buzzing ] [ high-pitched buzzing ] [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] You go first . - I thought that all of us- - - You soften him up . We 'll be right behind you . Better be . You should have kept running . [ laughing ] [ laughing ] I knew it . What do I need you for , huh ? [ laughing ] Oh ! Oh-oh . Oh , no ! [ screaming ] [ buzzing ] [ high-pitched buzzing ] [ buzzing recedes ] What happened ? I bet he 's got another tone generator . So ? You play back a tone slightly out of phase with itself and the two pitches cancel each other out . So that means .. [ laser beam sputtering ] [ blasts ] John ? John , let me in ! John ? [ glass shatters ] I knew you could do it . Don 't go back . Lana , I can 't hide anymore . Neither of us can . Nowhere is safe . Not even here . We have to fight them wherever they are . [ melodramatic music ] [ grunts ] [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] Lousy two-timer . [ gasps ] - Did you get it ? - Of course . [ suspires ] [ buzzing ] [ groaning ] [ switches clicking ] What are you waiting for ? Nothing . There he is . Finish him off ! [ chuckling ] If you think that I 'm gonna turn my back on you you 're outta your mind . - What 's the matter ? - What 's the matter ! Ask her what 's the matter ? She 's the one who made a deal with Superboy . What are you talking about ? I saw you and him . You couldn 't have . She probably figured that we couldn 't take him out so , she cut herself a deal . - You 're crazy ! - Ha-ha-ha . I 'm crazy , am I ? Ha-ha-ha , crazy ! I 'm going to show you crazy . [ maniacal laughter ] That 's crazy . [ choking ] Oh no ! Not again . Armor-plated cheese head . And now ... for the main course . Lex ! [ laughing ] Does it hurt ? Do we have a little ear-ache , hm ? I wonder if you even hear me ? Gee , I hope you can because these are gonna be the last words you 'll ever hear . or see , is the case , maybe . [ laughing ] Looks like you can do with little help from your friends . [ screaming ] [ dramatic music ] You are the one Metallo saw with Superboy . Sooner or later you would have fought amongst yourselves . You just needed a little help , that 's all . [ buzzing ] [ grunting and groaning ] [ grunting ] [ blasts ] [ dramatic music ] [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

 Relax . They 'll be here . Banks going to close in five minutes . Sure it wasn 't a bogus tip ? It 's real . I 've been on this long enough . I know the difference . Besides , I can feel it . I 'm inside their heads . just as long as you keepyours . Message received , Agent Scully , loud and clear . Position five . It 's Agent Willis . Doyou copy ? What , areyou nervous ? Nope . I just don 't want our luck to run out . Baby , you are my luck . No matterwhat happens whenever I look up at the stars I knowyou 're going to be looking up at the same ones . The same ones , baby . You make every day like New Year 's Eve . Get down ! Get down on the ground ! I want everyone on the ground now ! now ! Get down ! You too- - on the foor ! On the foor ! I 'll execute all ofyou ! ( woman screaming ) Put the money in the bag now ! Move ! Freeze ! Drop the gun ! fbi ! Drop the gun- - Now ! I need more saline in here , stat . Up to 360 , now . 1 1 minutes , 55 seconds . Clear . Come on , Jack . He 's been fatlined for over 1 2 minutes . Another amp of EPI and we 'll go again at 360 . Clear . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . You want me to pronounce ? No . You can 't give up on him . It 's been 1 3 minutes . He 's dead . Go up to 400 . We lost him . Let him go . I 'm a doctor . Go up to 400 or I 'll do it myself . Clear . Give him another amp of EPI intracardial and go up to 400 again . Do it . Clear . Again . Come on , Jack . Clear . We got a rhythm . Don 't ask me how , but he 's back . B.P. ' s 80 over 50 and climbing . 90 over 50 ... Hello , Mr. Goldbaum . How are we doing tonight ? ( gunshot ) Anyword from Willis ? Still missing . He hasn 't been home or checked in with the office . I heard something about a mutilation ? Yeah . Three fingers on Dupre 's left hand were severed by surgical shears . We lifted prints . They 're Willis 's . He was chasing this guy almost a year ? Yeah , he lived the case . It was all he thought about , talked about . What areyou thinking ? That maybe this is some kind ofpost-trauma psychosis . Like the way soldiers sometimes mutilate a dead enemy . That still doesn 't explain why he would just vanish . Dupre 's partner- - who was she ? Lula Phillips . They met while she was serving a ten-year sentence for manslaughter at the Women 's Correctional Facility of Maryland . He was a prison guard . Until the warden found out their secret . According to Lula 's cell mate they carried on quite a torrid romance . It says she was released on May 2 , 1 993 . One week before the first robbery at Annapolis Savings and Loan . The 65-year-old female teller was pistol-whipped . Died from a subdural hemorrhage because she didn 't get the money fast enough . Lovely couple . They took turns- - one pulling ajob while the other one drove getaway . The two ofthem have killed seven people and gotten away with close to $ 1 00,000 . That 's a lot ofmoney . Now she doesn 't have to split it . We 're putting her face out there- - local newspapers , America 's Most Wanted . Am I boring you ? Theywere married . Yeah , last May in Atlantic City . So what ? I don 't think this was a simple necrophiliac mutilation . Willis sliced and diced those fingers to get at the wedding ring . Anybody here ? Lula ? Baby , baby , baby . Damn . Scully : It 's a left thumbprint . You can see that whoever held that cleaver was using his left hand . " Whoever " ? It was Willis . Willis is right-handed . I checked his pistol grip at the armory . Bank surveillance tapes show Dupre is left-handed . I 'm not sure whereyou 're going . How long did Willis fatline ? just over 1 3 minutes . This is the E.K.G. strip that recorded his cardiac activity at the time . In your medical opinion , what does that look like ? It could be anything- - an instrument malfunction , electrical overload . But what does it look like ? Two heartbeats . Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest at the exact same time , right ? Right . Which means for minutes , both men were technically dead . Technically , but we resuscitated Willis . You resuscitated his body . Mulder ... Two men died in that crash room . One man came back . The question is ... which one ? What can you tell me about near-death experiences , Agent Scully ? The usual stuff- - the tunnel , the light people rising up and viewing their own bodies . How doyou account for the phenomenon ? Some sort ofdissociative , hallucinatory activity . Did you know that halfofall adults who have had a near-death experience can 't wear a watch ? The increased electrical activity in their bodies renders the watches inoperable . Now , I know this sounds kooky but as any biologist will tell you when cells die and genetic material unfolds tremendous energy is released . Mulder : Dr. Varnes believes this burst ofenergy is responsible for the transformational nature ofthe experience . People do return profoundly changed . Changed how ? Personality shifts , perceived psychic abilities increased zest for life . What about the negative consequences ? They 're rare , but apparently , in the process ofdying there is a window oftime during which the body is vulnerable . I don 't understand . There was a pilot in my support group who died in a commuter plane crash along with his three passengers . This was a fewyears ago . He recalls foating up and then feeling an overwhelming need to return to his body . He was revived in the ambulance- - the only survivor . It was soon after that that the visions started . Visions ofmaking love to his wife in ways and places that weren 't in his memory . A dead passenger on the plane was having an affair with his wife . The dead passenger 's consciousness survived through the pilot . What happened ? The pilot became increasingly disoriented- - a schizophrenic , his doctor claims- - until one day he strangled his wife with an extension cord . That 's a nice story . I don 't discount the near-death experience because it can be explained by stimulation ofthe temporal lobe . I sense a big " but " coming . It 's my best guess jack 's disappearance can be explained in psychological , not supernatural , terms . For instance ? The stress ofthe case , the trauma ofbeing shot jack 's personality . How well doyou know him ? We dated for almost a year . He was my instructor at the academy . The plot thickens . We even had the same birthday . We used to celebrate in some dive in Stafford that had a slanting pool table . But it was always so hard forJack to relax . It was impossible for him really . He was always so intense , so relentlessly determined . Doyou believe he 's predisposed to this type ofpsychotic episode ? It 's a long way from saying jack had a near-death experience to saying his body 's been inhabited byWarren Dupre . A long way . What the hell ? You 're such a creature ofhabit , Tommy . Who the hell areyou ? Get out ofbed . I ain 't got no clothes on . Get out ofbed . I don 't want to shootyou lying down . Areyou the rent man ? 'Cause I 'm all paid up . Come on , you can go ask Cosmo . Shut up . Where is she ? Where 's who ? Your sister . Lula ? I don 't know . I was waiting to see her on the news . What I tell you ? Check it out . The sound 's busted . Looks like they 'll find her beforeyou do , pal . Is that whatyou think ? That 's not what I think . I miss her , Tommy . I miss her so bad . That 's why I came back . Do I knowyou from somewhere ? Everything I see , I see her . jesus , man , you 're bleeding . Even ugliness is beautiful because ofher . Okay , what areyou doing ? You set us up , Tommy . You sold us out to the fbi . Dupre ? ( gunshot ) Neighbors heard a gunshot but nobody bothered to check it out . The patrol guys responded this morning to an anonymous 91 1 and found him here except the rats found him first . The victim 's name was Thomas Phillips . That 's Lula 's brother . There 's not a lot offamily resemblance left between the rats and the .45 he took in the face . Oh , I hate this nicotine stuff . What 's his story ? He 's single . He 's lived here alone for seven months . A few priors , small stuffmostly- - B and E , narcotics possession . Nothing like his big sister . Was the television turned on when they found him ? No . Why ? I don 't thinkTommy was a reader since he doesn 't own any books . From the position ofthe body , maybe he was watching the tube when he was shot . Print kit 's over there . Knockyourselfout . Out ofmyway , ace . Regulations state to gain access to a crime scene you got to show me l.D. Looks like you were right . Excuse me . jack ... ( gunshots ) Is there a problem here ? No , I just don 't have any l.D. and would you tell this gentleman who I am ? This is agentJackWillis . He 's with the Violent Crime Section ofthe Washington Bureau . Let 's talk out here . I wasjust doing myjob . For God 's sake , Willis , what happened ? Halfthe Bureau 's been looking foryou . Where haveyou been ? I don 't know . I just ... wasn 't myself . I woke up in the street . I 'm taking you back to the hospital . I 'm staying right here . You 're not ready to be here . Who says ? You 're recovering from a major trauma . It 's a miracle you can even walk around . This is Tommy Phillips' place , right ? jack ... Was he killed with a .45 ? As a matter offact , he was . That 's Lula 's weapon ofchoice . I know these people . I 've been after them for a long time . We 're halfway there . You did open the book on this one . I 'll be there when it 's closed . All right . But as a colleague and as a friend I 'm recommending you undergo a medical evaluation- - physical and psychological . All right , fair enough . jack , good to seeyou back among the living . It 's good to be back . jack . So what do we got here ? Mulder here found a print on the TV- - a partial oblique- - and it 's not the victim 's . Good work , Agent Mulder . I 'm impressed . That 's fancy shooting . Yeah , well , I got to get recertified before they give me myweapon back . I wouldn 't worry about recertification . Is there anything else you wanted ? Yeah . It 's , uh , Scully 's birthday and I was wondering ifyou 'd sign that for her . Sure . Be glad to . I 'm always glad to celebrate the good times . Hereyou go . Happy birthday , Scully . You 're two months early . It 's from Willis . I thoughtyou two had the same birthday . We do . Well , that 's news to him . I asked him to sign it . You mean you tested him . After I found out evidence from the Phillips murder is missing . What evidence ? The print we lifted . Our best lead is gone . Someone stole it before the lab had a chance to take a look at it . And you thinkWillis is responsible ? I 'm not sure Willis is Willis . Can you at least accept the possibility that during his near-death experience some kind ofpsychic transference occurred ? Can 'tyou accept the possibility that this isn 't an X-File ? Aside from the expected level ofpost-trauma stress jack passed both ofhis evaluations- - physical and psychological . Anyway , just because someone forgets a birthday doesn 't mean that he 's been possessed . When I was studying for my medical boards I forgot my birthday too . Did you forget how to sign your name ? This is a copy ofthe automobile requisition form Willis filed the day before he was shot . Compare the signatures . Like I said , Mulder , stress . We both know it can significantly affect someone 's cursive standard . I 'm afraid this doesn 't prove a thing . ( phone ringing ) Agent Willis here . jack , where areyou going ? We got a break . A landlord in Boyle Heights thinks he 's got our girl . Hot line ? Yeah . Saw her picture in the post office . Can I askyou something ? Yeah , sure . The print Mulder lifted offthe television- - it 's missing . And ? And you were carrying the evidence back . Areyou implying something , Agent Scully ? I don 't know anything about any missing print . Now I 'm ten minutes away from closing the biggest case in my career . Areyou coming ? What 's that apartment number again ? Number 202 . Oh , yeah . What 's this guy 's name ? Multrevich . Multrevich ? ( knocking ) Mr. Multrevich ? I 'm from the fbi , jackWillis . We spoke on the phone . Oh , yeah . Haveyou ever seen this lady ? Yeah . 207 . Two days ago . First and last month , cash . Where 's 207 ? Down the hallway , round the corner . Mr. Multrevich , go back insideyour apartment and stay away from the windows . Where 's our backup ? You called them , right ? Yeah , they should have been here ten minutes ago . She may be running down a fire escape . I 'll call it in again . Look . That 's her . Where is she ? Where did she go ? I 'll check back here . Aah ! Face down . Face down ! Hands behind your back . Now ! She 's all yours , Jack . Yeah . Like a dog on a leash . I already cuffed her . They 're foryou , Scully . Put them on . What 's going on , Jack ? Put them on , or I 'll blowyou in half . jack ... Shut up ! Put them on . Come on , baby . Come on , get up , baby . I want to look atyou . Your face is all dirty . Keepyour stinking hands offme . Baby , you ain 't going to believe where I 've been . Sure it 's crazy . You don 't think I know it 's crazy ? This isn 't my face , these aren 't my hands but it 's me in here . And I knowyou . I know everything aboutyou , baby . Come on , ask me something . Your birthday 's April 7 . Your favorite color is red . Come on . Come on , ask me something else . Come on , ask me . Okay . Okay . What did we do afterwe got married ? Right after ? After that . Well , we went down to the beach . I took out my buck knife and I sliced open my palm and then I slit open your palm ... and we let the blood drip down in the water . Then what did you say to me ? I said , " This is so we can be married in all the oceans ofthe world . " And then I madeyou a solemn oath ... to never take this ring off my finger . Ever . I mean to keep that promise . This is ... this isjust too weird . I can 't believe it 's reallyyou . Don 't worry , baby . It won 't make any difference in the dark . We 'll be in touch . When do I get my reward ? We 'll call you . Now I 'm worried . 1 2 hours with no word . I don 't get it . Why 's their car still sitting out in front ? Why didn 't Willis call for backup ? Because it wasn 't Willis who answered the hot line . You heard the recording . It was Willis ' voice . Forget it , Bruskin . Plus which , the manager just l.D. ' d him and Scully . I said forget it , Bruskin . This isn 't one ofyour X-File theories , is it ? It doesn 't matterwhat I think . We 're still after the same thing . ( phone bleeping ) Mulder . FBI centrex operator . please hold . Yeah . Guess who , ace ? Willis ? That depends on whoyou ask , don 't it ? Where 's Scully ? You 're the FBI you figure it out . Let me talk to her . Yeah . Sure . Mulder ? Dana , areyou okay ? Don 't ... Dana ? Okay . That 's it . Good-bye . It 's not going to work , Jack . You don 't think so ? Bureau policy prohibits negotiating with kidnappers . Butyou already know that , don 'tyou , Jack ? Stop calling me that ! Your name isJackWillis . You were born February 23 , 1 957 . You live at 51 Stanhope ... My name is WarrenJames Dupre and I was born in Klamath Falls , Oregon in the Year ofthe Rat . We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens . You taught me how to fish through the ice . It was your parents ' cabin . jack , try to remember . We drove up in a snowstorm . Come on , Jack . Don 't think I didn 't see whatyou did . I was like a little slip ofpaper up there on that hospital ceiling . I saw everything . What did you see ? You left me to die on that table whileyou tried to saveyour friend ! You are my friend . You are my friend . Too bad he was gone already . I watched him go . just slipped away down that long , black tunnel . No . We broughtyou back . You shot me dead ! And then you let me die . No . You won 't kill me , Jack . You call me that one more time I 'll makeyou stone-cold . Easy , baby , easy . Notyet . Remember , she 's our ticket . Got any more ofthis soda ? Lula : Youjust drank the last ofit . Soda ? How much ofthat haveyou had ? What 's it toyou ? jackWillis is diabetic . Which means you 're diabetic . Too much sugar in the system could lead to hypoglycemia . Maybe that 's why your stomach 's hurting so bad . Abdominal pain is the first sign ofimpending diabetic coma . You need insulin . Willis : I feel myselfgetting into their heads and I 'm scared bywhat I 'm feeling . The intoxicating freedom that comes from disconnecting action and consequence . Theirs is a world where nothing matters but their own needs their own impossible appetites and while the pleasure they derive from acts ofviolence is clearly sexual it also speaks to what WardenJackson called their operatic devotion to each other . It 's a love affair I almost envy . A drug store was reported broken into right here on the corner ofOld Forge Road and Madison I 'm betting Scully is somewhere within this five-mile radius . Am I missing something ? 200 units of N.P.H. insulin were taken with a box ofsyringes . Willis is diabetic . Get me a census report . Let 's see how many households we 're talking about . Quick , quick , quick . My legs are starting to go numb . Hold on . What the hell .. ? Drop the needle . Without this medicine , he dies . Yes , soyou said . Now , put it down unless you want me to putyou down with it . What the hell areyou doing , Lula ? I need that medicine . You still haven 't figured it out , haveyou ? Figured what out ? It wasn 't my brother who setyou up . You ? Yeah . Me . How doyou think I got away so clean , huh ? The minuteyou stepped into that bank I was out ofthere . I got the money , and I got rid ofyou . At least I thought I did . ( groans ) ( phone ringing ) Tactical room . This is it . Mulder . Lula : Listen carefully . Where 's Willis ? Oh , he 's lying around here somewhere . Let me talk to Scully . Not this time . We don 't deal unless we know Scully is alive . She 's alive . She 's not happy , but she 's alive . You listen to me- - you lay one hand on Scully , so help me , God . Ifl wereyou , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat 'cause ifyou everwant to see Scully again it 's going to costyou a million dollars . Have it by this time tomorrow . I 'll tell you when and where . We got it . It 's a 202 number . Great . Get the address . Forget it . Why ? It 's Scully 's cellular number . They 're using her phone . We can 't trace them . Lulu : She 's not happy , but she 's alive . Ifl wereyou , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . That last part , right ? Yeah , but can you squelch the voice even more ? Yep . Done . Ifl wereyou , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . Yep , yep , there 's something there . Definitely something at the high end . Let me throw on an extra Z-1 4 filter and isolate everything over halfa decibel . Ifl wereyou , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . There . That engine sound . Let 's clean it up some more . Ifl wereyou , I 'd stop talking and start passing around the collection hat . Is that a small plane ? Taking off , by the sound ofit . Give me a couple more minutes . We 'll guesstimate the altitude within a couple 1 00 feet . All right , people , settle down and grab a seat . Mulder says he 's got something . What ? An alien virus or new information on the Kennedy assassination ? Hey , Mulder 's all right . You should pay attention . You might learn something from the man . We 've identified what sounds like light aircraft taking off . Now , Washington County Regional Airport falls within our area , just south ofthe state line . Since takeoffs are north to south it 's a fair bet that our target area lies along this fight path . For those ofyou who remember ninth-grade math that gives usjust over three square miles to cover- - roughly 1 , 000 households . With 1 00 law enforcement officials at our disposal at about 30 households per man per hour we should be able to canvass the area in three hours . Agent Bruskin will grid the target area and divide it among the teams and for those ofyou who don 't know already this one 's important to me , so , uh , let 's do it right . Thanks . Let me see Steinberg Calder , and Westin . Scully ? Hmm ? Huh ? Was there snow ? Yes , Jack . There was lots ofsnow . I can 't ... It was December . It was the weekend afterThanksgiving . I remember ... a red stove . Yeah . That 's right . There was a ... there was a wood-burning stove right in the middle ofthe room . Cold . Yeah . So cold . I remember I had to wrapyou in a blanket when the wood ran out . Yeah . No . jack , don 't closeyour eyes . Come on , keep talking . jack , keep talking . Come on . Get down on the foor ! Get over there ! I 'll execute all ofyou ! No . No . ( gunshot ) Shut up and do it ! ( knocking ) just a second . Who is it ? This is BrotherQuinn . couldlspeak withyou ? This is BrotherQuinn . couldlspeak withyou ? What doyou want ? just a few minutes ofyour time . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? I wonder ifl can interestyou in the word ofthe Lord- - Ieather-bound in black or red . Go away . This is one-four . Target sighted . Well , I guess it 's time to make that call . He 's dead . It 's all on you now . He 's dead because ofyou . Well ... guess it 's over Whoeveryou are . Don 't move . jack ! Shut up ! I loveyou . Don 'tyou know ? You 're why I came back . This is Westin . They battened down the hatches . There 's no clear shot from this side . Ditto . Hold your positions . Keep radios at two . All right . How do we look ? Backup 's in but we still don 't know what 's going on in there . We will soon enough . I kept a bottle ofmedicine in the other room . I kept a bottle ofmedicine in the other room . I 'll go get it . I 'll get it foryou . Look , look , look I loveyou . I loveyou , baby . No . Listen , listen , listen . We still have her . We can get awaywith this . I don 't think so , baby . Not this time . jack , put the gun down . You remember that ... light that I talked about ? No . It 's beautiful . There 's nothing to be afraid of . ( gunshot ) No ! All right , fbi ! jack ! fbi ! Areyou okay ? jack ! Hi . I got this from the morgue along with the rest ofhis personal effects . I thought you might want it . " Happy 35th , love D. " I got it for him threeyears ago . Next ofkin ? Uh ... no . jackwas an only child . Both his parents died when he was in college . There 's a kid over in Parklawn . jack 's been his Big Brother so I 'm going to go and see him tomorrow . What am I going to tell him ? The official story . Which is ? Fugitive Lula Phillips died yesterday in a shoot-out with federal agents which resulted in the death ofSpecial AgentJackWillis- - killed in the line ofduty . ( sighing ) What am I supposed to tell myself ? Good night . It 's not working . It stopped . At 6 : 47 . The exact time thatJack went into cardiac arrest at the hospital . What does that mean ? It means ... It means whatever you want it to mean . Good night .

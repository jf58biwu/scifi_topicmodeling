 The guyver unit . It 's been a year since the alien armor invaded my body and became a part of me , a year since I first became the guyver and destroyed the kronos corporation and their shape-changing killers , the zoanoids . Now kronos is gone , but the guyver stays in me , calling me to fight ... To kill . Damn ! Hurry up . Find that shit . Bingo ! Hey , D.C. Dolls ? The latest technology . You mix cocaine with plastic , you can shape it into anything you like . Melt it back down , it 's 100 % pure . [ Bang ] What the fuck was that ? Benny , check it out . You got it . Starting to regret that career choice now ? There 's nobody up here . All right , girls . Come on , let 's hustle . Let 's go ! Let 's go . Move it ! Benny , we 're rolling . [ Banging ] Hey , Benny . I said we 're rolling ! Aah ! Holy shit . [ Machinery hums ] What the fuck is that ? Let the man go . Yeah , right . Fuck you . Get him ! Shit . Fuck . Stay away from me , man . Stay the fuck away ! No ! Oh ! No , please don 't ! Please don 't . Please . Don 't kill me . Just arrest me . Holy shit . This is delta 28 . We got severely injured men at 36th and California . Request ambulance assistance and backup . [ Sizzling ] Hey , moran . Over here . Shit . Yeah , it 's him , all right . [ Breathing heavily ] Aah ! Inside expose in three pines , Utah , to investigate what may be a werewolf attack . Doug kerlew and his brother judd were exploring some caves above these woods , when judd was attacked and fatally mauled . Rangers here are calling it a bear attack , but Doug has a different explanation . Yeah . I mean , it changed . Yeah . Right before my eyes . It--it was a man ... And then it was a thing with teeth and claws ... Like one of those cave paintings I showed you come to life . No , I wasn 't drunk . You people calling me a liar ? My brother 's dead , man . That ain 't no lie . When asked to describe his attacker , Doug gave us this drawing , which he says is a copy of the painting found on the cave wall . This , he claims , is what killed judd kerlew . I.E. Went looking for this cave to verify Doug 's story , and we found it . But an archaeological expedition investigating the cave was suspiciously uncooperative when we asked to shoot inside . Next up , more Elvis sightings . Which he says is a copy of the painting found on the cave wall . Hi , mizky . Look , I- - I 'm ready to try to make things better . I saw the papers this morning . It doesn 't look like anything 's better . I didn 't come here to talk about that . The security guard died , Sean . And those gangsters ? How many people are you going to have to kill before you realize- - I don 't kill . It kills . Sean , listen to yourself . You 've got to stop this . It won 't let me . That 's crazy . I know . And I want to end it . Will you listen ? There was a thing on TV this morning about a werewolf sighting in Utah . Werewolves . Zoanoids . If you saw lisker or balcus for the first time , what would you think ? God , stop it ! I don 't want to hear it anymore . There are no more zoanoids . Kronos is gone . Can 't you let it go ? What 's the point of holding on ? You go over it and over it and you get crazier and crazier . When do you just say that- - this isn 't going to work , is it ? Hey , thanks . [ Ding ] Excuse me . Uh ... There 's an archaeological dig going on near here . Do you know where ? Customer 's waitin ' . You going to buy something ? Uh , yeah . Well ? $ 1.95 . Do you know how to reach them ? I have to get to that dig . Don 't know nothin ' . Ask down at the rangers ' . What do you want at the dig ? Excuse me ? I said what do you want at the dig ? You work at the dig ? Maybe . You have business there ? I have to see it . You with the press ? Private site , you know . No . No , I 'm not a reporter . I just need to- - need to what ? Look . I been doing these for months . They 're like the ones I saw on TV , the ones from your cave . I see it in my dreams and put it down on paper . Yeah , I know what it sounds like . What ? You 've seen this ? You 've seen this . I , uh ... I can 't help you . Thanks , Warren . Please take me there . Sorry . I don 't think so . Wait . I need to know . I can 't . I 'm sorry . Will you wait a second ? Would you back away from the truck , please ? Wait ! I need to know ! Get in . I 'm cori Edwards . I 'm a researcher up at the dig . And you are ? Uh ... Sean ... Barker . Uh-huh . And ? Look ... I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to freak you out back there . It 's just ... This is important to me . Nice to meet you . So , um ... Why 'd you come back ? Because I 'm a scientist . I know what it 's like to need to know . Thanks . So , what do you want to see ? Right . Come on . Just be cool and follow my lead . I hope I 'm not getting you in trouble . Not if you do what I say . Mary , take this to the commissary , will you ? And don 't hog it all to yourself . Morning , Ms. Edwards . Morning , grau . It 's o.K. He 's with me . Watch your head . Do all archaeological expeditions have this much security ? We didn 't till your buddy on TV broke in . Cori ! Cori , over here ! Take a look at this . Um ... Wait here . I 'll be right back . You shouldn 't wander off like that . You know , if anybody asked about- - [ voices ] Come on . If we don 't hit pay dirt soon , they 're going to shut us down . I 'm tired of them treating this expedition like an oil well . I know , but they 're management . We had an agreement . I find you your pay dirt and run the show my way . Hey , that 's what I want . I 'm going to keep them off as long as I can . Just do a good job , o.K. ? I can 't make miracles . Yes , you can . That 's why you 're here . Dad , I 'd like you to meet Sean barker from state . He was supposed to come up earlier , but he had to finish a project . Sean , my father Marcus Edwards . Good to meet you , son . We can use the help . This is arlen crane , our operations director and Gus volker , our security chief . Welcome aboard . Nice to meet you . Soon , Marcus . O.K. ? Administration . Well , you go get him set up . I 've got to go crack the whip . O.K. Thanks , dad . Come on . I don 't get it . This is where you want to be , right ? Yeah , but- - so be happy . Hey , Bob . Yeah . Come down here a minute . Sure . O.K. , but we 're playing with my cards . Bob , this is Sean . Sean , Bob . Show him the ropes , will you ? I 'll be back soon . Sure . Come on . [ Whispers ] Lisker . So ... What exactly are we digging up here ? Well , we think it 's some variety of pachyocephalosaur , although it 's small for that family . Once we carbon-date it , then we 'll get a real good idea what era it 's from . Funny , once I was on this dig in Arizona ... Wow . Looks like you really immersed yourself . Yeah . It was like I was digging up parts of myself . You 're not some kind of archaeology groupie , are you , Sean ? It 's just that I ... Can 't figure you out . I mean , why is coming here so important to you ? Where did you see those drawings ? I told you . Oh , yeah . Right . Sean , I brought you here like you asked . Don 't you think I deserve a real explanation ? A hint , even ? Cori ... I want to ... But I can 't . I--I don 't really know what I 'm looking for . I know ... I know . That 's no answer . Yeah , your specialty , I 'm beginning to discover . Listen , maybe we should just call today a field trip , and tomorrow we 'll send you on your way . No ! I--I need to stay . Look , I--I know ... I 've got no reason to be here . You don 't even know me . But I need to stay . Why ? Because I can 't be anywhere else . I 've got nowhere else to go . I 'm sorry . That 's just not good enough . I thought you said you knew what it was like to need to know . I wonder . Damn it . Wait ! It was around here that we saw him somewhere . You think maybe we can do this when there 's a little more light ? You want this werewolf or not ? Look , you got about another half hour , Mr. kerlew . After that , I 'm calling it quits . [ Cocking rifle ] Just hang on to your checkbook . Jesus Christ . You think you 're the only one ? My dad and I are known among the academic community as outlaws of science . We were thinking about getting jackets made up . Outlaws . Why ? Oh , because of our unconventional theories . We take on the wild stuff . You know , the stuff that people laugh at in the tabloids- - bigfoot , crop circles . And the cave paintings ? You , uh , have a theory on them ? You know , I want to tell you ... But I can 't . Touch√© . Aah ! What was that ? I heard someone shouting . It could be another bear attack . You get help . I 'll take care of the bear . Right . He 'll take care of the bear ? Oh , shit ! Take a picture . Take a picture ! Screw the picture , you brain-dead hayseed ! Shoot it ! What about my money ? What about my money ? Shoot it ! Shoot it ! Hey ! Help ! Professor atkins , help ! Cori , what 's wrong ? I think there 's another bear attack . I 'll get my gun . You get the truck . Hurry ! Sean 's out there . What ? Guyver ! Don 't you come near me , you son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch . It can 't be . Guyver ? Get away from him , zoanoid ! Where did you come from ? I destroyed all of you . What are you doing in the camp ? Damn ! Huh ? Over here . This way . What happened ? Where 's the bear ? I don 't know . I think the sound of your engine drove it off . Oh ! Not soon enough . [ Groaning ] Look , that one 's alive . Oh ! Oh , man ! Stay away from me . Don 't touch me . You 're one of them . Look at him . He 's scared crazy . Take it easy . We 're here to help you . Are you all right ? He 's in shock . Get me a blanket . Yeah , right . Make that two . I 'm just sorry I didn 't get here sooner . Thank God you didn 't . You could have been killed . What did you think you were going to do ? I was wondering that myself . All right . Let 's get him in the truck . You two , wrap that one up and put him in back . I 'll keep us covered . O.K. Let 's move out . Who are you ? He was on the scene before anybody else . Barker . Sean barker . Not at this time , but analysis of the sample should- - [ snap ] I have to go . What did you hear ? What ? Nothing . I didn 't hear anything . Why 'd you follow me ? I--I- - let me guess . Just curious , right ? I saw you leave camp in a hurry . I just figured you 'd seen the bear again . We both know there wasn 't any bear . We do ? Spare me the dumb act . I know you got claws you ain 't showing . Claws ? I 'm not the one with the claws . I don 't know what you people are up to , but innocent people are getting killed , and I can 't allow that to happen . Wait . You 're with the government . And you won 't live long enough to give me away . [ Cocks trigger ] What were you doing ? Sorry , Mr. crane . Tell the others we may have an active- - what are you men doing there ? Uh ... We thought we saw the bear again , Mr. crane . Well ... For God sakes , stay in camp . We don 't want any more corpses . Yes , sir . Yes , sir . I got to go . Wait ! Who are you ? What are you doing here ? We don 't need this kind of attention . If you can 't keep a tighter rein on your lieutenants ... [ Whispering ] I 'm sorry , sir . I 'll correct my error . But it did bring something to light . The guyver , he 's here . He must be someone in the camp . Hmm . The hunted comes to the hunter . Find out who he is and bring him here- - quietly . Don 't worry , sir . I can handle it . Morning , Bob . How are you ? This wasn 't here yesterday . Huh . Cori , you can tell me . You like him ? None of your business . I 'm just excited for you , that 's all . It would be nice to know someone 's finding a little romance . All right . He 's cute . But nothing is happening . He 's a little ... Hi . Coffee ? Did I miss something ? Uh , no , Sean . Have a seat . That 'll be all . Check on you in a bit . Take your time . So ... How goes the quest ? Well , I was just wondering . What kind of skeletons are we digging up again ? Well , um , we 're not sure , but we think it 's a kind of pachyocephalosaur , although it 's small for that genus . Once we carbon-date it , we 'll know where to place it , but right- - what ? You know , that 's almost word for word what Bob said . What are you guys hiding ? They 're not dinosaurs at all , are they ? Look ... Everybody here knows what we 're digging for . So why all the secrecy ? We can 't just go spouting crazy theories to the world until we have the hard evidence to back it up . Dad and I have been putting this puzzle together for five years , just praying it isn 't another explainable mystery . If we 're wrong again ... So ... Why not just stick to the safer stuff ? Why don 't you go home ? I am not going to let anybody take this away from us . Well ? Feels like leather . It 's soft . Here , give me that . [ Clink clink ] That don 't sound like leather to me . Hey , Dr. Edwards . Dr. Edwards , over here . What have you got , my dear ? Listen . [ Clink clink clink ] This is wonderful ! Call my daughter . Inform Mr. crane . Get everyone in here on the double ! I think we 've found it . Dad , what 's going on ? Cori , I think our five years of research are about to pay off . But when will we know for sure ? Patience , arlen . We beat your deadline . Just give us the time to do this right . But there 's been a complication . Something 's come up . Arlen , please . Gee , you don 't suppose this is one of those explainable mysteries , do you ? Just shut up and dig . Dr. Edwards ! Dr. Edwards ! We took some readings at the cliff . It goes all the way to the top . This thing is huge . These cave paintings are accurate representations , and I speculate that it sinks down another 40 meters and curves east and west for 20 meters in each direction . It 's a ship . Whoo hoo ! [ Music plays ] Bob , have you seen Sean ? Not lately . Hey . You o.K. ? I still can 't believe it . I know what you mean . We came here hoping to find ... Anything , anything that would suggest an ancient alien visitation . We would have settled for alien beer cans . Instead , we got ... Five years of getting laughed at , our research ignored by our colleagues . Ooh , the paper I 'm going to publish . But the best part is that now I have got the greatest playground a girl could ever wish for . Look at this ! It 's organic . It was grown . That sample I took was alive- - alive , Sean . This thing might have been powered by photosynthesis . O.K. , that 's all theory , but with funding we can find out . We might even be able to duplicate it . Imagine being able to grow a machine . No more dirty factories . No more pollution . What ? Nothing . Now I see why they call you an outlaw . You haven 't even stepped inside , and already you 're saving the world . What can I say ? I 'm an optimist . Wish I could see the world like that . We , um ... We 're missing the party . I 'm not missing anything . Come on . Let 's go . [ Hissing ] Do you hear that ? Hear what ? Nothing . You want to see something really scary ? Ha ha ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ha ! [ Growling and moaning ] Hey , cori ! Come here . I 'll be just a second . Hey , what are you doing ? What do you know about the kronos corporation ? What are you talking about ? Come on . You dated a mizky segawa whose father worked for kronos . He was murdered shortly before the L.A. branch was destroyed . Do you know anything about that ? Only what I read in the papers . Hey , less of that shit , all right ? Let go of me . I don 't know anything . You knew enough to know the claws weren 't yours . What ? You said the claws weren 't yours . So whose are they ? That 's what I thought . I want to know what you know about kronos and what they do . Why ? You said kronos was destroyed . Kronos L.A. Jesus . We know kronos is worldwide . But we don 't know what those things are . We found breeding tubes and blood samples , but never any bodies . All right . Look . Kronos is those things- - the whole organization . They look human , but they 're not . They change . You 're serious , aren 't you ? You saw that dead guy last night . The thing that killed him is one of the guys in this camp . You saw this ? Then why didn 't he kill you ? I- - I 'll tell you later . No . You tell me now . Don 't make me arrest you . Here ? Everything o.K. ? Yeah . It 's fine . Nice guy . Kid , you got to get your priorities straight . Well , I 'm open to suggestions . Damn it ! We 've come this far . Now what ? We can have a laser cutter up here in two days , three days tops . Three days ? Don 't we have anything else in the camp ? Sure . Garden tools and whisk brooms . Lasers weren 't the first thing on the equipment list . But we don 't have time . What do you want me to say , open sesame ? [ Ship groans ] Amazing . It 's breathable . The radiation levels are acceptable . We can continue . The rest of you may resume your work . Cori . It 's beautiful . No one is to touch anything or enter any sealed room . We 're cataloguing only today . Take lots of pictures and try to map the interior as you go . If you have any trouble breathing , get out . We 're not sacrificing anyone in the name of science . Got it ? Good . Cori , you and Sean go that way . We 'll go through here . Let 's go . This way . You have to see this . Wow . It 's beautiful . It 's really humid in here . Can you hear me ? I 'm here . Talk to me , please . Well ? [ Whistles ] My God . How the hell are we going to get up there ? No stairs . No visible access up . I have a feeling that walking was optional for these people . We 'll have to Jerry-rig something , I suppose . Get started . I 'm sure what we 're looking for is up there . I 'm here . Well , you called me here . Aren 't you going to say something ? Please . I 'm trying , but I don 't understand . Please . Why did you do this to me ? What the hell am I ? What am I supposed to do with it ? You got the wrong guy . I 'm not cut out for this . I can 't live like this anymore . I 'm not a killer . I just want to be normal again . I want my life back ! Dad . Look at this . It moved . Cori , I told you not to touch anything . What have you found ? Let me see that . No ! Give it back ! Cori . We 're the researchers . It 's our job to examine the new artifacts . As the funders of this expedition , we have whatever rights we choose . If you don 't like it , go back to state and teach freshman archaeology , while we 're making history . Dad , why don 't you stop him ? This is the most important discovery we 've made , and you 're letting him take it away . We 'll get our chance , cori . Arlen 's just taking it away for , uh , safekeeping . Safekeeping ? He 's stealing it . Cori , are you o.K. ? Sean , he 's taking it away . This is a breach of contract , crane . We 'll sue you for this ! We were supposed to have free rein- - no interference from the corporation ! Do you hear me ? Forget it , cori . Dad . We 'll get our chance , cori . Just let it go . Cori- - no ! What is the matter with you all ? He took it away from us . Mr. crane . It 's about the new kid . Can I come in ? What do you want , Sean ? I have to talk to you about crane . I don 't want to talk about him right now . Cori , there are things you need to know . I don 't know how to tell you this , but ... You and your father have been lied to . You 're working for a corporation called kronos . Crane is a part of them . They ... They 're not good people . Where did you get all this ? I don 't know any kronos . Our backers are the tempus group . No . They 're kronos . Trust me . The thing you discovered is very important to them . It 's called a guyver unit . It 's ... It 's a powerful weapon . Kronos has been after it for years . All the people ... Shit . All the people who work for kronos can change into monsters called zoanoids . Volker is one for sure , probably most of the others . The monsters in the cave paintings and the skeletons you 've been digging up , they 're zoanoids . The bears that killed those people are zoanoids , too . They 've lived alongside us forever . All the stories you 've ever heard about werewolves or bigfoot , uh , they 're all- - cori , I know , but it 's the truth . Listen- - no , you listen . I don 't care who they are . They put up the money for this dig . If they pull out , the ship is gone . Oh , shit . We 've only just stepped inside . Is the ship more important than your life ? You 're dealing with monsters here . I trusted you , Sean . I trusted you not to be crazy . Damn it . Crane- - [ crane ] The ship we excavated is a gold mine , Mr. gouo . Now 's the time to terminate all nonkronos personnel and bring in our own . Terminate ? What about Edward 's daughter and the guyver ? [ Crane ] Don 't worry about her . She 's handled . And the guyver 's in our hands . He 'll be on the way to you in an hour . No promises , crane , just results . Mr. crane . Mmm ! I think we got a problem . Hey , Bob , have you seen cori ? You guys can 't seem to connect , can you ? Tell me about it . Try the commissary . It 's lunchtime . All right . Thanks . [ Noise ] [ Noise ] Excuse me . It 's calling you , isn 't it ? What do you mean ? It calls me , too . We 're both its children . Sean , I know who you are . I know your pain . I 'm like you . What are you talking about ? We 're the bastards ... Of an uncaring parent . We 've been violated . Our lives have been changed against our will . Sean , I know what it 's been like for you ... For me . You 've lost friends and lovers , haven 't you ? So have I. We 're forced to lead secret lives . Trust me . Raah ! Rraarh ! I know ! Look at me ! I 'm hideous ! Do you think I want to be this way ? That 's why we 're here- - to take back our lives . Somewhere in this ship is the key to changing us back . Let 's find it together ! We can take the guyver out of you ! We can make you normal again . Isn 't that what you want ? I don 't know . You 're killers . And so are you ! No . It 's the one that kills , not me . Then let us help you . We can make it stop . What do you say ? Friends ? I ... No . Pity . Keep him sedated until we return to the base . Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh ! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! I love my job . Comfy ? Hey , bitch ! What did we hit ? I don 't know . Well , step on it ! Aah ! Oh , my God ! You ! Girl ! Get out ! Shit ! Run ! Grrr ! Grrr ! Raahr ! You shouldn 't have interfered , Marcus . Dad ? Dad ! Dad ! Don 't hurt him ! Leave him alone ! Aah ! Aah ! Sleep tight , baby . Keep an eye on him . Yes , ma 'am . [ Punch ] Barker . Barker . Atkins . You o.K. , kid ? Yeah . I got to get you out of here . The government wants you in one piece . My backup is on its way . This place is about to become a battlefield . But the students- - shh ! The students are fine . Now , listen , about this guyver unit , what can it do ? Do they know ? Cori . I 've got to get her- - they 've already taken her . There was nothing I could do . Where ? They took the South road . What about this guyver unit ? I 've got to go . You 're not going anywhere . But she 's in danger . I 'm sorry . I can 't let you go . Now look . This--oof ! Oh , shit . Shit ! Aah ! Aah ! Raahr ! Cori ! Cori ! Sean ? Sean ! Help ! Help us ! Shit . Guyver . Ohh ! Take cover . Aah ! Yaah ! Aah ! No ! Sean ? Wait ! It 's done , sir ... But ... The guyver has escaped . He 'll be back . Mr. crane ! Help us ! Mr. crane . What 's going on ? I 'm sorry . Your services are no longer needed . Nothing personal . Wait ! You can 't do this . Hey , what is this ? Hey , man , be cool . You don 't have to do this . Oh , my God ! [ Pow ] Oof ! Don 't do anything ... Funny . Thanks for saving my life . I wanted to tell you , but how do you tell somebody- - what you told me was hard enough . It took a lot of guts , Sean . Look ... You don 't have to be nice to me , o.K. ? You didn 't know what you were getting into . If you don 't want anything to do with me , I 'll understand . It 's not the first time . Hey . It 's every woman 's dream to be rescued by a knight in shining armor . Even if he wears it on the inside . I left your truck at the top of the hill . Drive back to town . I 'll meet you when I can . Wait . I 'm coming with you . No . It 's too dangerous . Atkins is bringing in a strike force to arrest crane . Professor atkins ? Commander . He 's with the government . He 'll get slaughtered if I don 't get back . I don 't care . I 'm going with you . My father 's back there . I 'm not leaving him . O.K. Come on . Move it ! Move it ! Come on , people . Double-time . Go ! Let 's go ! [ Whistles ] [ Whistles ] This is an outrage . We 're a reputable company . Reputable companies don 't conduct sick experiments on people . The judge would laugh this case out of court . Too bad it 's not going to court . Don 't even try it , unless you think you 're faster than a speeding bullet . Camp 's secured , sir . Secured ? Where 's the other one ? One 's in the cave . This is the other . No , there 's one more . Where 's corbin ? This is becoming interesting , isn 't it , captain ? Eagle 2 , this is eagle 1 . One hostile still at large . Code red status . Shoot to kill . I repeat , shoot to kill . Read you lima Charlie , eagle 1 . Grrr ! We 'll find him soon enough . Aah ! Aah ! Or he 'll find you . Mason , Lewis , intercept the enemy . Yes , sir ! More lambs to the slaughter ? Looks like he did it . No . Something 's wrong . Where 's his backup ? Come on . We don 't have much time . Wait ! Would you wait ? What is it ? We have to destroy the ship . Destroy the ship ? Why ? Atkins is out there . Everything 's under control . I 'm not so sure about that . Besides , it doesn 't matter who wins . I doubt the government is more responsible than kronos . No . We can 't . All that knowledge . I 'll never get a chance- - neither will I. But if we don 't destroy it , too many people will die fighting for it . They want the weapons , cori . It 's all they 'll ever want . You know , that 's only going to piss him off . Grrr ! Now that we 've wasted enough time . [ Beeper beeps ] I have to take this . Your hour is up . Where is the guyver ? There 's been some delays . The guyver- - crane ! We 'll get him back . He 's fixated on the ship . He won 't leave . Have him here in another hour , or shall I send someone with more experience ? No . No . I can handle it . I 'll take care of it . One more hour , crane . If we lose him- - one hour , sir . Yes , sir . Shit . What gets me is I 've spent my whole life working toward this . I was scared that I was chasing some pipe dream . And the minute I find out it 's true ... I have to destroy it . What 's wrong ? Don 't fight it . Go . Keep setting the charges . Why do you keep calling me ? Am I not the one you want ? I 'm not the one , am I ? Guyver . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! The guyver will be back soon . Let 's prepare him a nice welcome . What about him ? Bring him . Lets show him some real soldiers in action . Come on , Sean . Where are you ? Take her ! Aah ! Arrgh ! [ Cori ] Guyver ! Uhh ! An archaeologist destroying the past . Not accepted scientific behavior , miss Edwards . It 's better than handing it over to you ! The guyver must be in the ship . Find him ! Uhh ! Let her go , crane ! Impressive ... But pointless . Are you o.K. , cori ? Yeah . Sean ... Don 't be a hero . Deactivate the guyver and surrender ... Or I 'll kill her . Don 't listen to him , Sean ! Ah ! Time 's a-wastin ' . Crane ... Stop ! Crane ... We had a deal . Dad , help ! Arlen ... Please . We had a deal . Yes . We pay for your research , and you give us the weapons . You should have told your daughter , Marcus . It would have saved us a lot of trouble . How can you bargain with this murderer ? Don 't you get it , cori ? Your dad 's a company man . Stand aside , Marcus . Now , one last time ! Retract the armor ... Or I 'll tear her apart . Ha ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ! No ! You will not hurt my daughter ! Ha ha ha ha ! Marcus ... You 're fired . Atkins , catch . Protect her . Who the hell 's going to protect me ? Me ! Ha ha ha ha ha ! Give me your case . The case . Yeah , but- - just give it to me ! O.K. , bitch , come get it . Hyah ! Your ass is mine ! [ Wild cackling ] Dad ! Unh ! Grrr ! Bitch . It didn 't have to be this way , Marcus . We were doing great things together . You could have been somebody in the company . Junior vice president in charge of genocide ? I 'd rather die . Aah ! Ha ha ha ! Then so be it ! No ! Leave him alone . Back off ! How 's he doing ? I don 't know ... It 's bad . Why are you attacking your own kind , freak ? We could have helped you . I 'm no freak , and I 'm not like you . You threaten mankind . I protect them . Barker ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! You didn 't . So tell me , who 's going to protect the protector ? Biomorph ! Oh , my God ! A guyver zoanoid . Ha ha . The next step ! You don 't know what you 're doing . That unit 's damaged . You have no idea what it 'll do to you . But it 'll do you just fine . You can 't win , crane . The ship told me the truth . You 're an experiment gone out of control . No . I 'm in complete control . The aliens created the guyver to fix their mistakes . You 're the mistake ! I 'm the final product . With this alien power , kronos will be triumphant , and man shall know his true destiny ... To serve our kind . You 're cracked , crane . You 're going to self-destruct . Never ! The unit feeds me .

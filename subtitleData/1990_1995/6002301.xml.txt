 So , did you say you were from around here ? No , I 'm from down under . Australia ? No , um , just down under . Okay . The name 's Charlie . Charlie ? As in Charlie the Tuna ? Yeah . Come , it is time for us to go . I 've told you before , Ariana , I 've decided to stay . You know better , Avar , we don 't belong . We are not meant to be here . What did she call you , Charlie ? I 'm very happy here , Ariana . I have every desire to stay here . Desire is a weakness we are not permitted . Not with their kind . Listen , Charlie , or whatever your name is , I have to go . Come with me . Why are you doing this to me ? To us ? I need to get away from you , Ariana . You and I are soul mates . We belong together . No . Not this time . Not this time . Are you sure you put batteries in this thing ? Yeah you go ahead and laugh . When I find gold that smile is gonna be wiped right off your face . Well , I have to admit you did find a penny back there about an hour ago . That , that was pretty good . It 's a sensitive piece of equipment . It 's state of the art , okay ? You see I read this book that pirates buried gold all along these beaches and I 'm gonna be the one to find it . Yes siree , me . Ha ! This is it . How can you tell ? Listen . This is it . I know this is it . Here kid , trade . Oh , I have a good feeling about this . Clark is gonna be upset that he missed this . He he he . Andy , you 're a man possessed . Yo ho ho . Treasure , here I come . Oh , baby , I know you 're here . Don 't let me down . I 'm really sorry I 'm late , but- - I found it ! I 'm rich ! I 'm rich ! Thanks , kid . I found--I found captain kidd 's buried treasure . Ha ha ! Clark , help me with this . Come on . Come on , Clark , help me out , man . I found gold in this thing . Come on , man ! Now , all you need is a boat . Ha , very funny . Well , you never know , with a little oil you might get it working . Oh great . Son , you 're gonna have to get that junk off the beach . Littering carries a $ 50 fine . See you back at the dorm , man . Tonight you can buy the pizza . Never . Bye . Hi , Lana . Why are you dressed like that , Lana ? Are you okay , Lana ? I mean- - Lana ! Would you tell me where I can find a man named Charlie ? That good for nothing ? You don 't want anything to do with him , sweetheart . Where does he live ? He lives in the Marina . What are you some kind of snob , or what ? Still no answer . It 's not like Lana to stay out all night . Well , Clark , maybe she met some guy , and they took a moonlit stroll and then they ended up just watching the sunrise . You 're not jealous , are you ? Shh , shh . - Listen . - With a bar full of men unable to stop her . Described as a beautiful throwback to the ' 60s this- - I 'm gonna go see if I could find Lana . And left the bar in a shambles- - Well , I would go with you , but I have this date with Vanna . Nobody talks to me that way , no- - You love it , babe . You know you do . Excuse me , I 'm Clark Kent , Shuster Herald . I 'm here to do a follow-up story on the girl that was here yesterday . Hey , stud muffin , I don 't remember seeing you here before . I usually don 't hang out in places like this . Well , what brings you here ? I 'm here to get a lead on the girl that was here yesterday . Forget that witch . You don 't need her , you got me now . Like hell he does . I 'm gonna stick you like a pig . Tiny , no ! Enough ! Enough ! You 're worse than that psycho dame ! She went lookin for old Charlie at the Marina . Charlie ? He lives in a dump of a houseboat . Thanks . I 'd be glad to pay for part of the damage . Just get out of my bar and don 't come back . That 's payment enough . Tiny . Tiny . Bar . Table . My lamp . Help me , please . Who are you ? I live here . Will you help me ? Well , whatever it is it can 't be as bad as all that now , can it ? If you wanna talk , I 'm willing to listen . I 'm sure you 're willing to do far more than that , Avar . Ariana ? Ariana . Can it be ? Is that really you ? Your folly has cost you dearly . We 're nothing more than a withered shell . Yes , but I 've learned so much from being amongst these surface dwellers . When they love each other they remain separate and independent and free . You know better . We are soul mates meant to be one . It is the only form of love that sustains us . But you cast a spell that kept me from becoming a human again . You deserted me forever ! No . It was not forever . For what it 's worth I always planned to come back for you someday . Oh . Well , I 've been making plans , too ... For revenge . Ahoy ! Clark Kent , Shuster Herald . Yeah , what can I- - what can I do for you ? Would you be Charlie ? Some people call me that , yeah . I 'm looking for a young lady who wrecked the anchor bar yesterday . Somebody told me I could find her here . You know her ? It 's Lana lang , a friend of mine . A good friend . Lana ? I am Ariana . Lana is under my control now . What 's going on here ? I channeled my essence through the first person that found me . Lana , it 's me ... Clark . Clark . Don 't let me hurt you . I don 't wanna hurt anyone . No more talk ! Now there 's only revenge ! Ariana . Lana ! Clark ! You 've killed a surface dweller . He was fortunate . But your fate will be less kind . I never stopped loving you . But you did . You left me . Superboy . I 've learned all about you from Lana . Whoever you are , you 've got no right to take a life . Do you really think your powers will stop me ? Fight her , Superboy . It 's the only way you 'll save yourself , and Charlie . What have I done ? It 's all my fault . The surface dwellers intrigued us . Ariana and I became humans for a moon cycle , but I decided to stay . She protested , so I had to abandon her . Her heartbeat 's slowing down . She 's dying . Her spirit depleted itself fighting you . She 's given up . She 's ready to die . You can 't take her ! I want her back ! Superboy , it is hopeless ! Ariana can 't be alone ! She thinks we 're never gonna be together again . I 'm sorry , Superboy . I can 't fight her anymore . I 'm withering . No , you 're not . I won 't let you go , Lana ! I want you back . I love you . Avar . The bond between these two was so strong , it brought the human back from the brink of death . Perhaps there 's still hope for us . Lana , are you still there ? Does that answer your question ? Ariana 's ready to go back now . After we get back can you drop us off in the sea ? I 'll be back . Captioned by Grant Brown

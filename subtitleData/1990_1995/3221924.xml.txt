 Europe ... 1944 . The second world war was now its fourth year . The stage was set for the most exciting ... I can 't take it , Wyatt . If something now doesn 't happen I 'll open my skull with a hacksaw and start playing with my brains . I 'm sensing you a bit ... perturbed ? I know how the war ends . Let 's drop the bomb and move on . ... we see the germans had the opportunity to win the war if not for one small mistake . Oh , God . Here it comes . Putting Colonel Klink in charge ... BOTH : ... of stalag 13 . So what are you saying ? You 're bored with history ? History , school , life- - it 's all so dull . Don 't you wish you could skip over the lame , boring parts and get to the fun ? I kind of like school . And what 's the point of complaining ? It 's not like we can do anything about it . True . There 's nothing we can do about it . - However ... - No ! We don 't understand her powers . They 're beyond our control . The woman is capable of anything . She could actually ... ( Gasps ) ... improve our lives . ( Both Yelling ) # ... Something like a recipe # # Bits and pieces # # Bits and pieces # # My creation # # Is it real ? # # It 's my creation # # Ooh , my creation # # It 's my creation # # RT and from my hand # # Why don 't people understand # # My intentions ? # What can I do for you boys ? Nothing . Big thing ! Here 's the deal . We 're tired of having to wait through the lame IFE to get to the exciting stuff . It 's not that bad . We were hoping you 'd have a few ideas . I could fill your lives with nothing but excitement . - For example ... - ( Mariachi Music Playing ) ( Gunfire ) ( Music Stops ) WAYNE : Hey ! What 's that racket up there ? My dad 's going to kill me . That was a little too big but on the right track . Right , Wyatt ? Whatever you come up with we got to have absolute control or I 'm not doing it . I got it . We need a remote- - only one that will speed up time whenever we want . Hmm . What , you recharged the batteries ? Just try it . Cool . A remote for the clock . I don 't want to rag on your handiwork but we 're looking for something that would speed up the big picture not just clocks in general . Oh , good . You ladies are home . It 's story time with big brother Chett . We don 't want to hear a stupid hunting story . Shut your stinking hole . I 'd listen up or I 'll snap the ribs from your spine like breadsticks . All right . Check it out . It must have been tuesday . No , wednesday . No , wait a minute . What 's the day the trash comes ? Wednesday , right ? Okay , so the day before- - Tuesday- - I wake up , and I ... ( Fast-Forwarding ) ... and then the cat blew chunks on the carpet . Great story , huh , girls ? How did I do ? BOTH : Yes ! Can I hold it ? I need to feel its cool , dark metal against my skin . We remember what Lisa said . This thing affects all of time so use it sparingly only in extreme situations . Gotcha . When we left off yesterday the americans were about to join the allied was effort . To recap the devastating attack of Pearl Harbor was still a recent memory . Hit it . ( Fast-Forwarding ) Who can tell me the names of the participants ? - ( Bell Rings ) - BOTH : Yeah ! Life without the boring parts . - I could get comfy with this . - Yeah , me too . I have to admit this chia pet wouldn 't be half as fun in real time . Whatever cranks your cheese wheel . ( Door Closing ) He 's here . Afternoon , puke licks . Afternoon , puke licks . - What did you call me ? - Puke bag . Butt cramp . Skank boy . Take your pick , dick . ( Yelling ) Chett will learn from this and that brings me joy . But I can 't help feeling there 's a greater purposis remote . I suppose we could go back in time and avert world wars and snuff out disease . I 'm talking about chicks . Gary , it 's illegal to go around freeze-framing women and taking off their clothes . I 'm talking about relationships . With this remote , we can skip over all that lame getting-to-know-you talky-touchy-feely crap and get to the good parts . - Can I help ? - Do you have to explode in like that ? Well , excuse me . Who put a kink in your hose ? I 'm sorry but tierine time-space continuum tends to make me edgy . How do we know he 's not , like , awake in there and watching everything we 're doing . Relax . It 's your personal remote . You are the only two people who have any idea that time is starting or stopping speeding up or slowing down . To everyone else , life proceeds as normal . WYATT : Where are we in all this ? You 'll have experienced everything . You just won 't have any memory of it . It 's what you wished for- - the ability to skip through the boring parts . So we could use it on dates . Sure , if you want to . I don 't know . I 'm not sure we should mess with the forces of romance . Wyatt , if we don 't let me explore the wide world of women we 're doing a disservice to science . WYATT : To you want . Who am I to stand in the way of science ? Thank you . Ready ? ( Yelling ) What the ... ? - Hi . - Hi , Gary . I can 't stay out late and I don 't like movies and I don 't eat fried foods . Let the fun begin . You know , I had an okay time tonight . You did ? Nothing seemed unusually ... unusual ? Everything was fine . I guess this is where I kiss you good night . Whoa . I made it clear . I just want to be friends . - Geez , Gary . - Right . Well , I guess this is where I kiss you good night . You took me to that dump you made me pay and then your nosebleed ruined my blouse . Kiss this ! - Good night , Gary . - Yeah , well ... - Good night . - Wait a minute . I thought maybe ... I don 't know ... Do you want to kiss ? You want to kiss ? Me ? After everything that probably happened on this date ? After the way I probably treated you ? After the stupid things I probably said ? I 'm losing the mood here . - That was nice . - Yes , it was . Good night , Gary . Yeah , well ... good night . Wait a minute . I thought maybe ... I don 't know ... Do you want to kiss ? That was ... Good night , Gary . Want to go out again ? - Next saturday ? - Great . I can 't believe we 've been only dating a week . It feels like longer . To you , maybe . Is this a button or a zipper thingy ? Gary , stop ! When do you want to go out again ? I don 't know . How about thursday ? Something tells me you 're not having a good time . It 's that stupid remote . I thought you were having fun with it . Gary 's having fun with it . I 'm stuck watching clocks spin . Every time he fast-forwards through his dates my universe goes on a caffeine high . I don 't remember what day it is anything I did this week- - I can 't even watch TV . Althrough it does liven up Pbs . You 're just mad at Gary for having a little fun with his newfound toy . " A little fun " ? Hmm . I see your point . He 's playing with the forces of natures all just to get girls . Ugh . See ? It 's all fun until someone loses a sandwich . It 's so romantic out here . Sometimes , if I close my eyes it reminds me of the farm we used to spend summers at when I was ... ( Fast-Forwarding ) ... and other times I just wish I could live there for the rest of my life . ( Fast-Forwarding ) I really like you , Gary Wallace . Mmm ... me too . I think that 's enough for tonight . Maybe I 'll see you in school this week . It 's kind of a special week for me , you know . Right . Special , special . Yes ! I like this . Wyatt . Hey , Wyatt ! Wait up ! Where you been ? I haven 't seen you all week . Gee , you still know what a week is ? I figured days , weeks , and months were all one big blur to you . Hey , that 's Sarcasm . You having a good time ? Me ? Hell , yeah . Got my remote . Got continuous lip action . What 's not good ? Your life may be continuous lip action but mine 's like a bad carnival ride . You want to skip to the weekend and talk ? No , Gary . I have a french test and I would like to savor every second of it , so if you don 't mind could we move through life at normal speed for the next 40 minutes ? Oh , what crawled up his shorts ? Hey , watch where you 're going . Donna ! You see that ? I stopped that big heavy door with my little face . I hate you , Gary Wallace ! - Come again ? - I thought I meant something to you and now you do this . Um , could you maybe give me a little hint ? See , my memory ... - Oh , you make me so mad ! - ( Gasps ) And what is it with you and this stupid remote ? No ! Don 't ! Whatever you 're about to say , forget it ! Hey , Ted . How 's it going ? Hi , Donna . There a problem here ? Give me the remote and we can have a heart-to-heart about whatever it is you 're rambling about . You want it , bonehead ? Go get it . GARY : No ! What ? - Donna ? - I hate you , Gary Wallace ! Hey , Donna . - There a problem here ? - Oh , no . I 'm trapped in time . - I hate you , Gary Wallace ! - Here we go again . Donna . What a surprise . I thought I meant something to you . You 're right- - it is low . Could I have that ? What is it with you and this remote ? Hey , Donna . There a problem here ? No . No problem here . Give me that . No . No ! - Leave her alone , loser . - You want this ? Go get it . GARY : No ! Let me guess . You hate me . That 's right . I thought ... You do mean something to me . Oh , then you realize what you did I do . What I did was terrible- - So terrible , it 's indescribable . I bet you can 't even describe it . Can you ? After all we 've been through you forgot my birthday . Birthday ? Forget ? I didn 't forget . Check it out . Surprise . Come on , Ted . # Happy birthday to you # # Happy birthday to you ... # You 're pathetic . And you 're too mature to throw that remote . There are now ten minutes left . There are now ten minutes left . Oh , no . What 's happening ? # Happy birthday to you ... # I hate you , Gary Wallace ! I just wanted to sing you happy birthday . - It is your birthday . - My birthday was yesteday . You didn 't even get me a card . I must have told you five times in the last week . Do you ever listen ? Of course I listen to you . Ted ! Oh , yeah ? Then what 's my favorite movie , huh ? Who 's my favorite group ? Where do I spend my summers ? I know that one . Some farm , right ? You don 't know a thing about me . Okay , you got me . I don 't know a thing about you . I just want that remote . Ted ! I 'm sorry . Ted 's being detained . I 'll take that . Leave her alone , loser . There are ten minutes left . Uh , something is very wrong here . Est-ce qu ' il y a un probleme ? Yeah . I really got to ... Uh-uh . En francais . Je vais aller de la ... de la ... mon ami , um ... There are ten minutes left . - Monsieur Donnelly . - Sorry . Go to run . Not as fast , young man . What do we know about running in the hall ? Now , I know this may sound like I 'm coming down on you but I remember one eyeless lad skewered by his own el marko . I don 't have time ! There are now ten minutes left . ( Groaning ) Lisa . Get me out of this loop . Please , make it stop . Once a wish is in motion , I can 't turn it off . I can 't do it anymore . You can 't give up , Gary . There is a way out . I hate you , Gary Wallace ! I 'll never get that remote . You really want it back that badly ? Skipping the dull parts hasn 't made your life any better . Maybe those dull parts are more important than you think . Are you just going to lie there ? Otherwise ... I hate you , Gary Wallace ! There are now ten minutes left . Monsieur Donnelly . Ah , what the hell . Viva la france ! - Good morning , sir . - Good morning . I think Wallace here needs a little attitude adjustment . GARY : Go ahead . You might as well hit me . I mean , I would if I was you . I missed my girlfriend 's birthday ! No present , no card . Not even a phone call . I 'm jerk . I thought I meant something to you . Ted , do you mind ? I 'm starting to lose feeling in my brain . You know why I didn 't but you anything ? Because there 's no present in the world that could express how deep my feelings run for you . You 're not buying any of this , are you ? Nope . Go fetch . Wyatt ! Incoming ! Yes ! Get me out of here . Fast-forward , pause , freeze-frame- - something . Not this time . I promise you 'll get to hit me . Just a minute . Donna ! Wait . Okay , I admit it . I never really paid any attention to you or the relationship . I just wanted to make out with you . And that 's your apology ? Yes . No . I don 't know . I 'm trying to be honest here , okay ? I like you a lot . I really do but I love making out with you . You dress incredibly hot . You smell ... so good and you have the softest lips in the entire universe . I kiss you ... I 'm in heaven . I don 't know whether to hit you or pull you in some dark corner . Well , I ... I 'd definitely go for door number two . You 're pretty twisted , Wallace . But awfully cuddly , don 't you think ? I got to go . I 'll see you later , Gary . later ? As in date later ? You 're a pal . Thanks for not zapping me out of there . Any time . And if you ever again force me to deal with my real-life situation head-on I 'll kill you . Okeydoke . Mr. Wallace ... would you care to do the honors ? With pleasure . ... And if you ever , ever mess with my gun rack again I 'm going to ram my fist down your throat and pull out your colon . Got it , girls ? I don 't think we 'll be needing this anymore . Captioned by Grantman Brown

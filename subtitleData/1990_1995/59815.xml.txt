 Prevoous / y on " Stargate SG-1 " : Cassandra ? What are you doing ? It helps , to do this . " Hok 'tar " is a hybrid of two Goa 'uld words . " Hok " , which means advanced , and " tar " , which I believe is a sort of slang . - For ... ? - Human . So essentially , it 's " advanced human " . " Hok Tauri . " An advanced human would be a powerful host for the Goa 'uld . Which explains why Nirrti was experimenting . A few thousand years on another world have changed you more than you know . I can make you more powerful than you could imagine . The powers you have seen in Wodan and the others ? Only a fraction of what I could give you . I must apologise , Colonel . This is a meagre feast to offer visitors from another world . No need to apologise . It appears delicious . We are a poor people . We are forced to spend most of our time in the mines . - For the greater glory of Baal . - Of course . According to our information , Baal abandoned this planet 100 years ago , when the naqahdah mines went dry . The naqahdah is scarce and difficult to extract , but there are deposits . Are you feeling unwell , Jonas Quinn ? I 'm fine . Just ... It 's hot . We have not seen Lord Baal for many generations , but we continue to offer him tribute through his emissary Lord Mot . You expecting this guy soon ? He will arrive in 12 days , at the rising of the full moon . Stop talking like an old fool . It would be madness to defy Lord Mot . With each passing year , the mining grows more difficult . Soon it may be impossible to meet Lord Mot 's demands . But we have no choice . They are gods , after all . Are they not ? They have great power . - That is true . However ... - Ellori . However ... what ? We have an ancient prophecy that one day strangers would come through the Chaapa-ai to slay the gods and free our people . Now you have arrived . And you also carry weapons of great power . Stop talking like an old fool . It would be madness to defy Lord Mot . Jonas ? I need some air . Jonas . Preliminary tests seem to indicate that Jonas is in perfect health . But given his history with naquadria research , I decided to do an mri . Now , it shows an area of unusual brain activity right about here . - Any explanation ? - No , sir . I don 't know if this is linked with what happened on the planet . I had a dizzy spell . It was probably the food . Maybe , but I don 't wanna take any chances . - I 've scheduled some follow-up exams . - Very well . According to Tok 'ra intelligence , not only did Baal abandon P4S-237 over a hundred years ago , but he no longer receives any naqahdah shipments from the planet . - Where 's it going ? - Perhaps Lord Mot is keeping it himself . What do we know about him ? He was the Canaanite god of death . According to mythology , he was defeated by Baal and forced to live in the underworld . In all likelihood , there was a power struggle . Baal defeated Mot and forced him into servitude . Maybe he doesn 't want to serve any more . If he is stockpiling naqahdah without Baal 's knowledge , he may move against him . If Baal no longer has any knowledge of what 's happening on the planet , we could possibly free these people . If the System Lords think the planet 's worthless , nobody will take his place . Did they ask for our help ? - Mm ... not exactly . - I think they were afraid to ask directly . But they did hint that they no longer believe the Goa 'uld are gods . - What do you think , Colonel ? - We 'll need a lot more intel . Hey . You wanna get some lunch ? It 's Mexican today . Ellori says Mot isn 't due to return for another 12 days . - That gives us plenty of time . - I 'll contact the Pentagon . Hey . You wanna get some lunch ? It 's Mexican today . - What ? - I knew you were gonna say that . What are you talking about ? Before , when we were in the briefing room , I had a ... I don 't know . It was like a vision . I was standing here holding this notebook . You came in and said what you said . When you think you 're reliving a moment , it 's called déjà vu . It 's normal . It 's caused by a split-second delay in sense perception . No , this was different . It was the same on the planet . I saw something , and then it happened . - When ? - Just before I passed out . I didn 't think anything of it at the time , but now it 's happened twice . Sir ? We just completed a second mri . There 's nothing to suggest that Jonas' exposure to naquadria is linked to this . According to Major Carter , he claims to be having visions . He 's also beginning to suffer from headaches . The symptoms are similar to those of the scientists on Kelowna , but there are no indications of schizophrenia . There is , however , a small spot on this MRI that has me worried . - You know what it is ? - I 'm not sure , but it could be a tumour . - Is this what caused him to pass out ? - It 's possible . Sir , I think it would be best if you took Jonas off active duty . - This is ridiculous . - Fraiser 's just covering ' all the bases . Something else has to be going on here . Whatever she saw in that MRI has to have something to do with these visions . It can 't be just coincidence . You guys didn 't believe me when I saw those alien creatures . They were real . So you 're seeing things before they happen . - That 's right . - Like what 's for lunch ? No , I can 't control it . It just flashes . We have encountered many strange phenomena , but we have yet to meet anyone that could see the future . It goes against all the laws of physics as we understand them . Have you had any more ? Jonas ? The Tok 'ra are coming . ( Stargate a / arm ) ( man overPA ) Unschedu / ed offwor / d actovatoon . Her name is Sina . SG-1 , this is Sina of the Tok 'ra . We have further information about the System Lord Baal . - Is there a problem ? - No , sir . Please . Baal has suffered a recent military defeat by Lord Yu . Anubis is very disappointed . It 's hard to believe that Yu hasn 't been destroyed . As he is the only System Lord still in opposition to Anubis , - his persistence is remarkable . - You go , Yu . Baal 's recent campaign was meant to be a final blow . But Yu escaped , and Baal suffered heavy losses in the process . So he screwed up , and his boss is pissed at him now . If I understand you correctly , yes , that would be a fair assessment . Clearly Baal is vulnerable . This may be an ideal time for Mot to move against him . If he becomes a System Lord , he won 't have to keep his operation on 237 secret . He could garrison the planet . So if we 're gonna help them , we 'd better do it soon . Another headache ? Yeah . None of us had met that Tok 'ra before . You couldn 't have known her name . I can 't explain it . I saw her in the briefing room , General Hammond said her name , then a few minutes later it happened . Teal 'c said you 've never encountered aliens with precognitive abilities . Yeah , we haven 't . But we have come across other psychic powers . On P3X-367 . Wodan was telekinetic , Eggar was telepathic . - Then Cassandra ... - You think Nirrti is involved ? It 's very possible . She had me in that gene-splicing machine for over an hour . What if she did something to me ? It 's hard to say without a biopsy , but all tests indicate that the tumour is not made up of cancer cells . - Then what is it ? - I 'm not sure . But I do know that it 's grown by over 50 per cent since the last test . I 've never seen anything like it . - What can we do ? - I recommend immediate surgery . If we don 't get it out of him soon , the intracranial pressure will kill him . I 've called in a neurosurgeon , Dr Sandy Van Densen . She 's the best . I 'm not completely convinced that surgery is the right way to deal with this . - Jonas , it 's going to kill you . - You don 't know that . We don 't even know what it is . Jonas and I think it 's possible that this has something to do with Nirrti , that it 's a step towards the creation of a Hok 'tar . So you think this is the result of genetic manipulation . Jonas thinks the new tissue in his brain is somehow giving him precognitive abilities . For all I know , you may be right . But if this tumour continues to grow at its current rate , it is still going to kill you . It may stabilise . Nirrti never did anything to anyone that didn 't turn out badly . Colonel , you of all people should realise what an advantage this could be . Imagine if we knew in advance when the next Goa 'uld attack would come . You have yet to provide such valuable information . All I 'm saying is just give me some more time . At least 48 hours . Make it 24 , and you 'll remain on base for observation . - What about the mission ? - You 're going to sit this one out . Colonel , I want you to take the rest of SG-1 and SG-15 back to the planet for a full tactical assessment . If there 's a chance we can free these people from the Goa 'uld , I wanna know . Yes , sir . Dismissed . Blood pressure 's a little high . - How are the headaches ? - Not good . Jonas , why are you doing this ? Even limited precognitive abilities would be invaluable to our work . You still think you have to keep proving yourself , don 't you ? You should consider the possibility that you 're valuable enough already . - Let 's run another EEG . - Yes , Doctor . Jonas ? - How 's she doing ? - Respirations are shallow , pulse weak . Sam , can you hear me ? Sam ? - I 've lost the pulse . - She 's in V fib . - Anything ? - Nothing . - Charge to 200 . - ( nurse ) Charging . ( DrFraoser ) Clear ! Jonas ! Colonel ! Colonel ! You have to scrub the mission . - Why ? - Major Carter gets hurt . I saw it . Colonel O 'Neill , what the hell 's going on down there ? It was a medical emergency . Major Carter was rushed to the infirmary with what looked like a staff blast wound . According to the villagers , we won 't encounter Jaffa for days . Maybe they 're wrong or maybe they lied . We can 't know for sure . That 's just it , Jonas . There 's no way we can know . Maybe it won 't happen this time . - It could be weeks from now . - I can 't see that far ahead . We can 't second-guess every decision . It 's a risk every time we step through that gate . I agree . But until we have a better understanding of what 's going on , I 'd prefer to err on the side of caution . Was anybody else hurt on this thing ? I only saw Major Carter . Then she can sit this one out , just to be on the safe side . Agreed , but , Colonel , be careful . Yes , sir . Major Pierce , report . We swept the who / e vo / / age , sor . There 's no sogn ofany Jaffa actovoty . As I said , Lord Mot will not arrive for many days . All right , stay sharp . O 'Neill , out . Have you decided to help us ? - Are you sure you want this ? - It is as the prophecy foretold . Now , screw the prophecy . I need to know your people are willing to follow through on this . Last winter , there was a terrible sickness in the village . Many could not work . When Lord Mot arrived and there was not enough naqahdah , we tried to explain . We begged his forgiveness , but he would not listen . He took ten of the sickest , including my daughter 's husband , and executed them in front of the whole village . We would do anything to be free of this burden . ( a / arm ) ( man overPA ) We have a medoca / emergency on / eve / 25 . What happened ? We were overhauling the gate generator . The capacitor blew . - Anybody else hurt ? - Major Carter . - How 's she doing ? - Respirations are shallow , pulse weak . Sam , can you hear me ? Sam ? - I 've lost the pulse . - She 's in V fib . - Anything ? - Nothing . - Charge to 200 . - Charging . - Clear ! - Clear . - What do we got ? - Pulse is back . Regular signs . OK . Let 's get them both into the infirmary . Let 's move . Thanks . - Hey . - How you feeling ? Slightly overcooked . Janet says I 'll be fine . - Sam , I 'm sorry . - For what ? If I had kept quiet , you would 've gone on the mission . This wouldn 't have happened . I envisioned it , but I didn 't understand it . I misinterpreted the vision . I won 't make that same mistake again . - Don 't do this to yourself . - I 've been thinking about this a lot . I 've always been hyper-observant . I see details that other people miss . I see patterns . Maybe predicting the future is just an extension of that . It doesn 't work that way . According to Newtonian physics , yes . If you knew the position and velocity of every particle in the universe at any given time , you could predict all of their interactions for ever . So the future is predetermined . You just need to figure it out . Yes , but quantum mechanics blows that out of the water . The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says it 's impossible to see a subatomic particle and know both where it is and where it 's going at the same time . The more you fix its position , the more uncertain its velocity , and vice versa . We can only calculate probabilities . OK , so then I 'm seeing probable futures . Maybe . But every vision I 've had has turned out exactly the way I saw it . It doesn 't mean they always will , Jonas . - Does Mot arrive through the Stargate ? - No , he usually arrives by ship . - Where does he land ? - Here . - ( tea / ' c ) How many Jaffa ? - Eight , maybe ten . Clearly , he 's not anticipating resistance . Colonel , we can do this . There 's plenty of cover here and here . - They 'd never know what hit ' em . - We 'll do a sweep of the area tomorrow . - I will show you . - Old fool . Chazen . These outsiders have led you astray , but I 've taken care of everything . - What 'd you do ? - ( spaceshop overhead ) A scout ship . Lord Mot is coming . Jonas , we need to go over these test results ... Jonas ! This is Fraiser . I need a medical team to level 18 L-7 . You know , every time I wake up in Goa 'uld cell , I can 't help the thought that something bad is gonna happen . You are the Tauri of Stargate Command . And you are Lord Mot , come to punish us for our insolence , et cetera , yada , et al . - That is correct . - Yeah . Mr Mot , we 're onto you . We know what you 've got planned and we 've informed the Tok 'ra . If we don 't report back on schedule , they 're gonna rat you out , tell your boss . You intend to send a warning to Baal . I think that 's what I said , isn 't it ? I said that . I think this is unlikely . You would not be here if you did not wish to protect the people of this planet . If Baal discovers the mines are still active , he will return . - There will be no message . - Baal is in the service of Anubis . If you kill him , you will have to answer for it . - You may be of assistance in that regard . - I don 't think so . It is known among the System Lords that an iris protects your gate . Obviously , you must transmit some code before you return to your planet . I suspect you use one of these . You will tell me the code , and I will use it to destroy Stargate Command . Anubis will congratulate me on my ... initiative . - We will tell you nothing . - Not at first . But eventually . However , for the moment , I must deal with these villagers . I cannot let their treachery go unpunished . - They had nothing to do with this . - My spy tells me otherwise . Of course , I could be convinced to spare them some discomfort . Very well , then . I 'll leave you to think about it . What am I doing here ? You had a seizure . We can 't wait any longer , Jonas . If this tumour gets much bigger , we may not be able to remove it safely . - Right . - What is it ? Sir , I 'm receiving an IDC . It 's SG-15 . - Open the iris . - Yes , sir . - SG-15 , this is Hammond . Come in . - ( statoc ) Repeat , this is General Hammond . Please respond . ( a / arm ) I need to talk to General Hammond . Now ! When you closed the iris , it was too late . They set off a bomb that destroyed the gate room , maybe the whole mountain . - You sure it was SG-15 's iris code ? - Positive . We have to warn them . But maybe sending a message causes this to happen . - Like when you warned Major Carter ? - Yeah . Jonas , we 've been over this . The future isn 't predetermined . Without other information , we have to follow normal procedure . If I didn 't have this vision , we wouldn 't be talking . - We 're already beyond normal procedure . - What do you suggest ? We need more information . We need to know how the Jaffa get the iris code . Maybe I can find that out . - You can 't control the visions . - I haven 't tried hard enough . No . Jonas , if we don 't get you into surgery right now , you could die . I need just a little more time . Excuse me , miss . How about sending a little of that our w ... w ... way ? Or not . Wow . What 'd you put in that stuff ? Kelmina root . They will sleep for many hours . I retrieved this . Chazen has the rest of your belongings . - I dared not take more . - Where 's your father ? He 's being held . Lord Mot intends to make an example of him . We can help him . But we have to get to the gate to get reinforcements . I understand . - How do we get out ? - This way . Boys . You think that 'll help ? It works for Teal 'c . - Jonas ? - I 'm OK . We 're good to go . Teal 'c ! Jonas ? - ( mumb / es ) - What ? Jon ... I need some help in here ! Get him on the bed . We 've gotta get him into surgery . Grab the gurney . Easy . - Jonas ? Jonas . - ( groans ) Jonas , can you hear me ? This path will take you to the Chaapa-ai . Colonel , I fear Mot will execute my father . There is not much time . Just stay out of sight until we get back . Not yet . - What happened ? - We can 't wait any longer . Sam ... Sam ... I saw . I know what 's gonna happen . Sir , they 're walking into an ambush . Jonas says the Jaffa will be waiting for them at the gate . We must warn them . - Dial P4S-237 . - Yes , sir . We 're ready , Doctor . It 's OK . Just relax . - What 's happening ? - It 's OK . - What 's going on ? - It 's OK . Get the lorazepam . It 's OK , Jonas . It 's not your problem any more . ( overradoo ) Co / one / O 'Neo / / ? Thos os Hammond . P / ease respond . MajorPoerce , do you read me ? Jonas be / oeves there may be a Jaffa presence awaotong yourarrova / at the Stargate . Exercise extreme caution when approaching the gate . I repeat . Exercise extreme caution when approaching the gate . You may be walking into an ambush . - Do you copy ? - Sendear . - Check on the prisoners . - Yes , sir . Co / one / O 'Neo / / , do you copy ? Major Pierce , do you read me ? They could be out of range . Maybe they received the message but can 't respond . - What about the MALP ? - Not receiving anything , sir . Sir , SG-3 is prepped and ready to go . I just can 't risk it , Major . I could be sending them into an ambush . We 're just going to have to hope that O 'Neill gets the message . The prisoners have escaped . Sound the alarm . ( bug / e ) Pierce . - Who ordered the alarm ? - I did . The prisoners escaped . Idiot . I allowed that foolish girl to help them . My Jaffa are waiting at the gate . I could not have known . You must forgive me . You are mistaken . ( gunshot ) ( thud ) Scissors . There it is . It looks like an astrocytoma . Isn 't that unusual ? Given that the tissue isn 't malignant , yes . We didn 't see any evidence of it on the mri . This must be a recent formation . We 've got reticular infiltrates . This could get a little tricky . Blood pressure 's dropping . Heart rate 's 120 and climbing . - He 's haemorrhaging . - I need more suction . I don 't see it . Blood pressure 's 80 on 60 . Heart rate 's 160 . We gotta find the bleeder . He 's pre-arrest . Run a litre of saline . Have dopamine standing by . Get a unit of O neg . - Pressure 's 60 on 40 . - Doctor , we 're losing him . Hold on . I see it . Retract this flap . I think I 've got it . Pressure 's coming up . Heart rate 's stabilising . OK . Let 's get this thing out of him . Move , move ! Still no signal , sir . Sir , I 'm receiving an IDC . It 's SG-15 . SG-15 , this is Hammond . Come in . Repeat , this is General Hammond . Please respond . If we don 't open the iris and it is Colonel O 'Neill and SG-15 , then ... The second they step through , they 'll be killed . I 'm aware of that . - Open the iris . - Yes , sir . Got a wounded man here . ( man ) Clear the ramp . Good to see you . General , request permission to return to the planet with SGs 3 and 10 . - We have some unfinished business . - Permission granted . - Expecting someone else , sir ? - We 'll explain later . Hey ! I thought you were supposed to be resting that brain . - ( soghs ) - How you doing ? I 'm a little sick of staring at these walls , but other than that I 'm fine . Dr Fraiser thinks they got it all out . The post-op analysis said the tumour was similar to ordinary brain tissue , but that the neurons were five times more densely packed . Nirrti definitely had to have something to do with this . This kind of thing doesn 't happen naturally . Are you still having visions , Jonas Quinn ? Not since the surgery , no . So ... no lottery numbers ? - Afraid not . - No trip to Vegas , just you and me ? So how 's it going on 237 ? They are planning a celebration in our honour . They wanna thank us for getting rid of Mot . - We 're bringing the food this time . - Good idea . All right , visiting hours are over . Jonas , you need your rest . Well ... get well soon . We need you out there . Yes , sir . Is he feeling all right ? I knew he 'd warm up to you eventually . You know , it is interesting . We changed the way things played out , which would seem to indicate that the future isn 't predetermined . But by doing so , we fulfilled an ancient prophecy . A thousand years ago , someone in that village predicted this would happen . How do you explain that ? Maybe it was just a lucky guess . Yeah . Visiontext Subtitles : Tram Nguyen Zelniker ENHOH Skaara , join us . - You know why you 're here ? - Then it is true . There 's not much time . Kasuf will take the women and children to safety . No one will be safe anywhere . How can we defend ourselves against a Goa 'uld as powerful as Anubis ? Our lives are meaningless if we don 't stop him finding what he seeks . You must rally all those capable of fighting . All those willing to die . All those who must not fail . Daniel ! You won 't be alone . Hello , this is C ... Hello ? Jack ? Jack ? Hi , Jack . Jack , Abydos is in trouble . Anubis is on his way . He 's after the Eye of Ra . I have that replica Catherine gave me . It looks like this . The real one is in a secret chamber in Ra 's pyramid in Abydos but I 'm not sure where exactly . According to legend , there were six Eyes , including those held by Apophis and Osiris . Each is powerful alone , but together that power increases tenfold . Anubis has tracked down five of the Eyes and only needs Ra 's to complete the set . He 's looked everywhere except Abydos . Now he 's on his way there . I was sure that was an aspirin I took . Jack , it 's really me . You have to find the Eye of Ra before Anubis . Keep it , hide it , destroy it , whatever . We don 't have much time . Hey , Daniel . How ya doin ' ? Long time . How are things in the higher planes ? - Hey , Jack . How you doin ' ? - Fine , just fine . - The knees , the back ? - Kind of weather-contingent . So , what 's new ? Actually , a funny thing happened to me today . I 'm in an elevator and an old friend , someone who never calls , never writes , just shows up and tells me about this very important , urgent mission that needs my attention . - Are you gonna help or ... ? - Let me tell it . It 's good . You see , this buddy of mine , this pal , this chum , has ascended to a whole new level of existence . Do you see the irony ? He 's asking for my help , and he 's this great and powerful being . Jack , I can 't actually do anything . I 'm still not clear on that . The Others have rules . Talking to you is a violation . Like jaywalking , double-parking ? Taking action that changes human existence , that 's a big one . Let me ask you this . Have you met any of these other guys ? No . - Then how do you know they 're a threat ? - Oh , that 's a good one . Oma 's an outcast because she believes helping people ascend is our duty . And that 's OK ? Technically , no . But those of us that follow her are walking a very fine line . - Why don 't they try to stop her ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? - No . I know what Oma has taught me . Ascension doesn 't make you all-knowing . It is just the beginning of the journey . The point is , if I were to take any action to help you , Oma would stop me herself to avoid drawing the wrath of the Others . They could stop everything she 's been trying to do for a long time . I can 't jeopardise that . We can 't match forces with Anubis but the Abydonians are willing to back us on this one . Colonel , how 'd you come by this intel ? - ( c / ears throat ) I didn 't say ? - No , you didn 't . Daniel told me . - You saw Dr Jackson ? - Actually , it 's not the first time . - ( Carter ) ls he all right ? - What else did he say ? Whoa , wait ! You guys don 't think I 'm nuts or anything like that ? - I too have recently seen Daniel Jackson . - Really ? - Why didn 't you say something ? - Why did you not ? To be honest , I wasn 't sure it was happening the first time . Neither was I . Did he tell you where we could find the Eye ? uh ... he doesn 't know . - He doesn 't know ? - I know ! I think this whole ascension thing is overrated . It 's good enough for me . If Dr Jackson is right , we have to find that Eye before Anubis does . O 'Neill . Skaara . - It is good to see you . - You too . - I 'm Jonas . - Good to meet you . - We are prepared to do whatever you ask . - Appreciate that . Teal 'c , set up a perimeter . I want to know the second we have company . - Any idea where this Eye thing is ? - I will show you . This is as far as the catacombs go . Daniel and I have spent much time here . No Eyes ? The Eye of Ra is mentioned many times on these walls . Just so we 're clear , it 's not a real eye . It 's a kind ofjewel or something . Well , we have never been able to find it . ( O 'Neo / / ) So , you seeing anybody ? Maybe . Really ? Is it serious ? We are betrothed . Trust me , that 's serious . - Congratulations . - Thank you . I assume my invitation got lost in the mail or ... I wanted to ask you to shaloke . - To stand beside me . - Just during the ceremony , right ? Yes , yes . I 'd be honoured . Will you be coming to my wedding alone ? um ... - I assume Carter 's invited too ? - Of course . Will you be coming together ? - As in ... ? - Friends going to a wedding . Ah ! Yes . Sure . Jonas ? Is there something you wish to ask me ? - You are a friend of Daniel Jackson ? - Indeed I was . Skaara says he 's not dead . He 's now a god . A god he is not . - Is he not powerful ? - That remains unclear . Daniel once brought freedom to my people from the false god Ra . He has asked us to fight , we will fight in his name . Die for his cause if we must . Skaara says Daniel will protect us , watch over our families . I am unsure as to what you have been promised . But if you are not prepared to die , you should not be here . - How ya doin ' ? We don 't have all day . - I know , believe me . But there 's nothing . Just a lot of talk about the power of Ra , the size of his domain . Big domain ? No mention of a secret chamber where he keeps his most valued possessions . - Right . - ( exp / osoons above ) ( tea / ' c ) O 'Neo / / , we 're underattack . Ground forces have / anded . We wo / / not be ab / e to ho / d them offfor / ong . - Roger . You heard him . - I don 't know what to say . - If Dr Jackson was here ... - Oh , he 's here . Trust me , he 's here . Son of a bitch ! Hey ! Where are ya ? We 're only doin ' this because of you . Jack . It 's here . I know it is . - Daniel ! - Sam . Jonas . Dr Jackson . - You hear that ? - ( exp / osoons ) I can 't do anything about that . I don 't care . Do something or we walk , right now . Remember that fine line we were talking about ? Cross it . OK . I always thought there might be a secret chamber here . This section talks about how Ra draws his power from the sun . ( tea / ' c ) O 'Neo / / , we cannot ho / d ourposotoon . Fall back to the pyramid . You do your stuff . I 'm gonna help Teal 'c . I will come with you . Fall back ! Fall back ! um ... can 't you just zip into the wall and see if there 's something on the other side ? It 's complicated . Some kind of trigger for a secret door . " Rays of the sun ... reveal all . " Rays of the sun . There 's no sunlight . - Do you think any light will do ? - It 's possible . Maybe you need to focus it a little . OK . Is that my stuff ? You weren 't using it any more . Yeah . - How many ? - Many . - Carter ? - Sor , we 're workong on ot . Work faster . Yes , sir . I thought we were onto something , but ... - You were . - It 's not working . - It 's red . - What is ? The rays of the sun on the fresco are red . - Sam ? - Yeah . Jonas . Sweet . Daniel , what is it ? - I 'm an Ancient . - What ? Not me , but the Others like me , they 're the Ancients . This is one of their oldest dialects . I always suspected but never knew for sure . What does it say ? The Ancients evolved from a human race long ago . They were wiped out by a plague . Many learned to ascend and the rest died out . - I have to go . - Where ? I 'll be back . Don 't lose that tablet . It talks of a lost city . It 's invaluable . Daniel ... Teal 'c ! - What if it 's not here ? - Maybe there 's a secret compartment . - Inside a secret chamber ? - Why not ? Why not ? ( ho / / ow c / ang ) Right here . I can 't see a latch or a jewel like with the other door , - but there 's gotta be a way to open this . - Yeah . Stand back . - Sir , we got it . - It 's too late . We did not hold the gate room . Anubis dialled the Stargate , - preventing our escape . - Got Jaffa on our ass . - Where 's that Eye ? - Right here . - What are you gonna do with that ? - See how much Anubis wants that thing . Surrender or die . What ? Surrender or die . I was just gonna say the exact same thing . O 'Neill of SG-1 . Hey , how ya doin ' ? You 'll have to forgive me , I 'm terrible with names . What was ... Jeez ! I am Herak . Congratulations . Baling upwards , I see . - You have no choice . - Actually , I do . I 've got the Eye , and a pound of very powerful explosive stuck to it . Give us clear access to the gate or I 'll blow it up . Yourself along with it ? What 's your point ? - I will speak with my master . - Yes . You do that . Don 't forget to tell him you screwed up again . - Is it necessary to antagonise him ? - Yes . Would you really do it ? Sure . Why not ? ( tea / ' c ) O 'Neill . Skaara is in need of medical attention . I 've failed you . Now stop it . My lord . Humans from Earth and the one named O 'Neill have found the Eye of Ra . We have them trapped , but he says if we do not grant them free passage he will destroy the Eye . ( dostorted ) He will give you the Eye of Ra , or I will destroy Abydos . Yes , my lord . You won 't touch Abydos . - And how will you stop me ? - I can , and I will if one more person down there is hurt . You can only stand there and utter empty threats , because I know what you are . If you know what I am , you know I can wipe you from existence . I know who you are , Daniel Jackson , but you know not who I am . O 'Neill , can you hear me ? Yeah . Anubis commands you to turn over the Eye of Ra or he will destroy all of Abydos . Tell him to go ahead . He 's not getting the Eye . He 's bluffing . We won 't have much choice . If we blow up the Eye he 'll destroy Abydos anyway . He 's just as likely to attack after we give it to him . Maybe not . He 's a Goa 'uld . ( Skaara ) O 'Neill ? In didea varsukay yanuk . - What 's he saying ? - He speaks of a bright light . Nat zee gougah . Of giving up . Of releasing something . Sapur . ( dostorted ) With a wave of my hand , I will bombard the surface . Try and stop me if you choose . What makes you think I won 't ? Your words mean nothing . Take action ... if you dare . Maybe I won 't have to . I command the collective forces of the System Lords . You managed to rally them against me . You hand over the Eye of Ra or face destruction . I will consider your most generous offer . You won 't survive that many motherships . They 're not attacking because they fear me . Maybe . Maybe I 'll tell them you don 't have the Eye . And they can beat you if they strike now . - Do you know that for a fact ? - Maybe I 'll deliver the Eye of Ra to you , if you give me your word you won 't harm the people of Abydos - ever . So be it . That 's a promise I 'll hold you to no matter what . Sir , you 're not considering shooting our way out ? No . Anubis must really want that thing in one piece - if his boys have held off this long . - He does . - Where were you ? - Busy busy . Hey ... Thanks for Skaara . I assume he 's OK . What are you talking about ? - He has ascended . - What ? That wasn 't you ? Oma 's here watching me . - And ? - And I don 't care any more . - Anubis is one of us . - What ? At least partly , in some bastardised way . What are you talking about ? The Goa 'uld Anubis used to be learned how to ascend . He was believed dead for some time . - The Others didn 't want him . - understandable . - They sent him back . At least they tried . - And what is he now ? He 's still some form of energy . That black mask is a shield , keeping his form intact . He 's stuck between human existence and ascension . Why have the Others allowed him to remain that way ? - Maybe they couldn 't exile him . - Maybe they don 't care . Maybe . Either way he 's still very powerful . That explains his mastery of Ancient technology . - How 's that ? - Jack , the Others are the Ancients . The original creators of the Stargates . - You didn 't tell him ? - uh , no . ( footsteps ) All right , look , just bottom-line this for me , will ya ? System Lord motherships are surrounding Anubis . I warned them about the Eye . Nice ! - Turn it over . - What ? I made a deal with Anubis . You turn the Eye over , you go free , and Abydos will remain unharmed . - You made a deal with Anubis ? - I 'll make sure he keeps it . The Goa 'uld will fight over the Eye and destroy each other . But even if they don 't , you 're gonna find the lost city of the Ancients . Lost city ? Didn 't tell him about that either ? Daniel found a tablet talking of a lost city . Where there are Ancient weapons capable of giving you an advantage over Anubis . - Do you know where it is ? - No , but I 'll help you find it . Nothing will happen to the Abydonians . You 've got to get away with that tablet . If Anubis gets it and finds the lost city before you do , it 's all over . He already has a huge advantage over you because of what the Others failed to do . - You gonna kick his ass ? - If I have to . - Can you ? - We 'll see . Nothing will happen to the people of Abydos . ( O 'Neo / / ) Coming out ! I assume you know about the part where you don 't kill us ? As much as I would like to . Jaffa ! Kree ! Well , spank me rosy . Let 's book . My lord . The Eye of Ra . ( dostorted ) The ship 's weapons are now fully powered . Your time is up . Of that you are gravely mistaken . Sounds like a hell of a battle going on up there . They are retreating . Yes . What now , my lord ? Now I will destroy Abydos . Stop ! Stop me if you can . Strike me down . Do it now or I will destroy Abydos . ( Danoe / groans ) Don 't do this ! You are indeed all-powerful , my lord . ( dostorted ) What you just saw was not my doing . However , this is . ( screamong ) ( a / arm ) What was that ? - What just happened ? - Abydos was hit . - You saw it ? - I felt it . Just before I came through . Sergeant , call up a full gate diagnostic ! - What have you got ? - I 'm workin ' on it . A large burst of energy was transmitted just after Colonel O 'Neill came through . Carter ? Lucky they closed the iris when they did . An energy wave followed you through . - Redial . - Yes , sir . Welcome back , SG-1 . What 's happened ? There was an explosion on the planet after we left , sir . - Is that possible ? - unfortunately , sir . We 're dialling Abydos to see what happened . Chevron six encoded . Chevron seven will not lock . - Briefing room . - Yes , sir . The only thing we can assume is that Anubis didn 't keep his deal with Daniel . That 's a shock , eh ? And that he was unable to prevent Anubis from destroying Abydos . Now Anubis has a weapon that has given him superiority over the System Lords . We don 't know any of that for sure , sir . We need to find the city that 's described on that tablet . Can you translate this ? Yeah . It 'll take some time but Dr Jackson did offer his assistance . I 'm not sure we can count on Daniel any more . He would have done everything in his power to protect the Abydonians . If he was prevented from doing that , then ... ( a / arm ) Chevron five encoded . Major , how many times are we gonna dial Abydos before you give up ? until a Tok 'ra ship flies over the planet and tells me there 's no one left alive . Chevron six encoded . Chevron seven ... locked . The MALP shows the pyramid is intact . No evident damage . - What about the explosion ? - I can 't explain it , sir . I 'd like to go , sir . Make sure the people are OK . I guess everybody 's all right . Skaara ? O 'Neill . What 's going on here ? Anubis destroyed the pyramid . Everyone was killed in the blast . They don 't look dead to me . But then neither do you . Death is only the beginning of one 's journey . That sounds familiar . - What of Daniel Jackson ? - I 've not seen Daniel . - Do you know if he 's OK ? - I do not know . One named Oma did this . All of you ? I wish you well , O 'Neill . You will not see me again . At least not for a while . - Take care . - Do not fear . You will find your way . What do you mean by that ? The Chaapa-ai will remain until you leave . Let 's go home .

 All right , Cindy , so Wednesday night at 8 . All right , I 'll bring the Clay . - All right . - Andy , hang up the phone , get the map out , and tell me where we are right now . Okay , bye-bye . Geez . Ah . You know , that wouldn 't happen if we could put up the top . The top was up when we started and then you were driving , and we got lost three times , but at least this way we 're lost , but happy . I got it ! I , I got it ! I see it . Okay , we got a ways to go . It 's route 81 . That 's route 18 , Andy . Huh ? Whoops , map 's upside down . Hold on . Whoa ! That 's it , Andy , get in the back . Clark , you 're co-pilot now . I 'm not sitting in the back . This is my car , and my uncle who 's letting us stay at his mansion for free . Without me you guys would be spending another boring weekend on campus . If we even find the place . Maybe we should backtrack . We 're not backtracking , poindexter , what we need is a good driver . Of course , I could do better it 's my car . Ugh , I can 't believe you , Andy . You can 't believe me ? I can 't believe you ! - What ? - Let me drive . - Get out and walk ! - No ! Get out and walk ! That 's it . I 'm not driving anymore . Listen , Lana , just because you have a lousy sense of direction don 't blame it on us . Me ? I have a lousy sense- - well I hate this stupid car . Stupid car ? This is a Cadillac ! It 's the greatest car ! It 's an American car ! Oh , well fine . Guys , we 're here . Clark , we 're arguing ! What ? Go around the corner . Huh . Well , this is it . How do you like it ? Golly . So , what do you think ? How do you like it ? This is quite a house . It looks like it 's at least 150 years old . Oh , it is . It was built before the civil war by my Uncle Nathan 's dad , my great-grandfather , Horatio MccAlister . He was a Marshall in the old west . I never knew your family had that kind of money . Well , we used to back when Horatio founded the MccAlister firearms company . He made quite a killing . I knew you were gonna say that . Oh , come on , ease up . It 's a little bit of the MccAlister family humor . But what happened to all the money ? Well , that 's a long story . Come on , I 'll show you . It 's a weird thing about Uncle Nate when his father died and he passed on the place he got kinda paranoid . He thought the ghosts of all the bad guys Horatio killed were gonna come back and get him . Ghosts ? Clark , move . And then he got weird . He spent the last 50 years and the MccAlister family fortune building these strange additions to the house . No one knows why . Check this out . Oh , this is great . This is amazing . Yeah , well it should be for what it cost . He had guys working in here night and day . Ha ha . I love that . Then the construction crews left when they ran out of money . Are you sure it wasn 't the ghosts ? Ah , you don 't think that , do ya ? Ah ! Help ! Ah , I forgot about that one . I won 't . Andy , this place is really dangerous . Why don 't we just check into a hotel , okay ? No , this place is great , are you kidding ? You haven 't seen anything yet . Why don 't you just stay close to the ground level . What kind of a place is this ? It 's great , isn 't it ? Don 't touch that . There 's trap doors and secret passage ways all over the place . You could be lost forever . Ah ! You see what I mean ? So , that 's your great-granddad , Marshall MccAlister ? Yup . An actual lawman in the family . Well , what do you think , Clark ? Where 'd he go ? Oh . I don 't know , he could be anywhere . Clark ? Clark ! I 'm really worried about Clark . Don 't worry about it , Lana . He 'll show up in a year or two . Andy , I 'm serious . He , he may be trapped behind a wall or something . Okay . All right , all right , all right . Just don 't get excited . We 'll ... Backtrack and we 'll find him . Just let me look at this real quick . That is the MccAlister Carbine . The original rifle that my great-grandfather used to kill all those bad dudes . I 've been dying to get my hands on this . Maybe you shouldn 't , it might be loaded . What do you think I am , stupid ? You always check the rifle , always . See ? No bullets . I don 't point it at anybody either . I know a lot about this kind of gun . I still don 't think it 's a good idea . Your uncle had his reason for not- - Oh come on , Lana . The guy was senile , you 've seen the house . Besides what he doesn 't know won 't hurt him . Bang . How did that happen ? You saw there weren 't any bullets in it . I told you not to play with that thing . Wait a second . Something 's not right here . That gun was not loaded . Now what ? Clark ! Get some help ! Hurry ! Right , right ! I 'll try to contact superboy . Ahh ! He he he . Ooh . Ha ha ha . Hold on ! We 've been waitin ' for ya . It 's about time somebody fired that dang carbine . I hated livin in that ghost world . It sure feels good to be out of there , but I still got me a hankerin ' for revenge . Don 't forget our pals back in the void . Remember the deal we made ? Shoot no ! Pretty soon , little lady , all of the folks killed by Marshall MccAlister will be free replaced by real , live folk . Mm-hm . And starting ' with the son of the Marshall who put us in here in the first place . Old Nate MccAlister himself . Ha ha ha . Now , let 's go get Nate out of that hospital . Where are we ? I don 't know , but those ghosts changed places with us on earth . I don 't understand it . I fired that crusty , old gun and ... The next thing I know here we are . Look at this place . It 's some kind of strange graveyard . Very observant . I just hope Clark 's okay . Clark called me from Andy 's car phone . I guess he made it out of the house . He 's out of the house . He 's driving away in my car at 100 Miles an hour . He wouldn 't desert us . Well , what , what if he didn 't ? What if he 's still in the house with those ghosts ? They 're gonna get him . Andy those ghosts are after your uncle , Nate . Well , we got--we got to try and save him . We got to try and help him , come on . Let 's try and go through these doors . Let 's go after him . Guys , I don 't mean to be alarmist or anything , but I think we 're the only people in here with a pulse . Dr. Winston Shepard , please report to ward d . Ahh ! Nate , we 're comin for you . Ha ha ha . They found me . Ha ha ha . How ? How 'd you get out ? After all these years ? After all my precautions ? Well , you got your stupid nephew to thank for that , old man . And you 'll get the chance to thank him up close and personal like real soon . You mean Andrew ? What have you done with him ? Same thing we 's fixin to do with you , old man . Go on , get him outta here . Well , looky here . We finally got us a real live lady . They won 't have nothin ' to do with us . Get your hands off of me . Ha ha ha , but you will , won 't ya ? Hey , that 's enough . Pretty fancy duds for a Marshall , feller . I never saw such a big badge . Ha ha ha . So , you ain 't never died by the gun before , has you ? And who 's the girl with ya ? Listen , listen , there seems to be a misunderstanding . We took a wrong turn , and if you just wanna show us the right door we 'll- - you ain 't going nowhere . My powers seem to be weakened . This here new Marshall 's too tough for us . Let 's get outta here . Get in there you old coot . And by the way , gramps , you 'll be the first to go in . Oh no , they got Uncle Nathan . You spent all that time trying to keep us locked up in there . And then your stupid nephew opened the door for us . It wasn 't all that fool construction kept us away . Nah , this here gun is the key to the door that separates our two dimensions . Now , we 're gonna open it and put you inside . Then , we 'll gather up others until all the living are there , and all of us are here . They 're talking about putting more people in here . They won 't get the chance if they do what I think they 'll do . All right , get ready , gramps . You 're in for the last round-up . Yee-haw ! Oh no ! Ha ha ha ! Are you all right ? Oh , I 'm all right , but I 'm awfully sorry I caused you all this trouble . All right . We got bank jobs to pull . Superboy , if you 're gonna do something do it now ! What in tarnation ? Say your prayers , you mangy old cat . All right , let 's settle this once and for all . Hurry , come on through . What are you crazy ? They 're shooting . Trust me , do it . He 's right . And since you started it , you go first . Ahh ! Oh , darn it . All right ! They 're history . See ? It 's workin ' . All right , now you just hold it right there . I 'm the fastest gun in the west . But I 'm faster . I got hit . No holes . Andy . Wake up . He he he . Yep . This boy is a MccAlister through and through . Yeah , I guess he 'll be all right . More ghosts . No , Andy , I don 't think that 's a ghost . I think I know exactly what that is . Ahh , I think I saw a ghost . Did Superboy get here yet ? Yes , Clark , Superboy got here , and as usual , you missed everything . Captioned by Grant Brown

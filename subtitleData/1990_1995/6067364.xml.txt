 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel . The speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ theme music ] [ intense music ] Anybody down here ? [ music continues ] Anybody home ? [ music continues ] Hello . [ light switches on ] What 're you doing down here ? What 's your name ? Are you okay ? Are you ... okay ? Oh , I 'm fine . I was just worried about you . Worried ... about you . Look .. Look . You 're doing everything I 'm doing , aren 't you ? Everything . Stupid question . Stupid . Why don 't we go find out who you belong to , okay ? [ intense music ] Ah , aah ! [ music continues ] [ buzzing ] [ intense music ] Let me give you a hand there , Clark . Thanks , Matt . Wanna go to lunch in a bit ? I can 't . I gotta read these files . What about Lana ? Can 't she help ? Jackson asked her to but .. ... she got a message about ghosts in somebody 's house . Ghosts ? Yeah , it 's a house on Water Crest . They think they have a ghost in the basement . They 're so scared they went to a hotel . Probably been seeing too many Stephen King films . Kent , aren 't you done yet ? - Where 's Ms. Lang ? - Well , I- - Out in the field again , when I asked her to help you ? - Well- - - Well , what ? Dennis , I asked Lana to run an errand for me . She 'll be back soon . She 'd better be . So , I lied . We 're not in Kansas anymore , Clark . Who are you ? How did you do that ? [ intense music ] What are you gonna do ? [ ghostly tone ] I am going to be you , totally . You don 't wanna be me . I have a horrible job , and I 'm always risking my life . And I 'm in love with a man who doesn 't even call . [ ghostly tone ] I need an identity . What about your own ? The little girl ? [ ghostly tone ] That wasn 't me . That was the first person I encountered when I got to this planet . So , you 're an alien ? Yes . See , we have no identities of our own . We need them to exist . Lots of them . What happens ... after you take them ? What 's happening to you now . Death . No . [ phone ringing ] ( Dennis ) I 'm sick of this , I really am . She should be back in a minute , Dennis . There 're a lot of students who 'd die for this internship . Lana almost has . If she 's not back in half an hour you can throw out the word , " almost " . You don 't have to do this . I 'll tell you everything you wanna know . This ... will be easier . For me , anyway . [ phone ringing ] What 's that ? You don 't know what a telephone is ? Tell me . It 's a warning system . If I don 't answer , my friends will know I 'm in trouble . Oh , it will be answered . But not by you . After all .. [ Lana 's voice ] ... we have the same voice . Gotcha . Got you , honey . Jackson 's going crazy . We gotta get Lana back here . I 'm trying her now but there 's no answer . Did you dial it right ? Maybe she 's on her way back . She said she 'd be gone an hour . - And it 's not up yet . - Let 's hope she 's on time . Lana ? She 's always on time . [ intense music ] Whoo ! Ha ! Your friends weren 't very patient . All I heard was some sort of musical note . That was the emergency tone . They 'll be here in a few minutes . Are you telling the truth ? Or are you lying ? Let 's find out , shall we ? [ intense music ] ( male # 1 ) She 's a redhead , just like you . ( female # 1 ) I wanna name her Lana , after grandmum . How many times do I tell you ? Don 't touch the stove . ( Dennis ) Lana Lang , A . Welcome to the Bureau , Ms. Lang . Now , get me some coffee . [ music continues ] Broken ! We have a temper , don 't we ? Sometimes . I need to ask you about someone . I saw him . He 's strong and powerful . And we love him . He 'll know you 're not me in a minute . - Oh , that 's all I need . - For what ? I want his strength . His invulnerability . I need them to make myself complete . Oh , I don 't want him . I wanna be him . But you 're me , it 's too late . Is it ? Now , tell me everything I want to know about him . Temper . ( Dennis ) Ahem ahem . About that little errand that your friend Ms. Lang went on ? - Yes , sir . - Why isn 't she back yet ? Well , you see , sir . Um .. - Hi , everybody . - Lana . Right on time . One of my best qualities . [ pleasant music ] ( male # 2 ) Is it ever gonna slow down ? ( Dennis ) Kent , Kent . ( Lana ) Where is he ? Where is who ? You have good hearing , don 't you ? Well , yeah . I was looking for Superboy . Why ? What 's wrong ? Nothing 's wrong . Then , why 're you looking for Superboy ? [ intense music ] [ Newton 's pendulum clicking ] Does he only come when something 's wrong ? - Who ? - Superboy . You 'd know better than I would . I would ? Come on , Lana . It 's almost like the two of you have some kind of psychic thing . He always seems to know when you 're in trouble . - Who does ? - Who do you think ? Superboy . He does , doesn 't he ? Now that I think about it . I have to go back to the basement . - More ghosts ? - Wasn 't anything there . I left my flashlight , that 's all . I 'll be back by 7 : 00 and you know how prompt I always am . [ intense music ] [ footsteps approaching ] [ music continues ] Ah ! I should have known you were going to do that . But you didn 't . My education was incomplete . But that is going to change , isn 't it ? Now , tell me everything you know about Superboy . Lana 's not back yet ? She 's late . First time for everything , I guess . Not for Lana . Where did he come from ? Tell me ! Where did he come from ? I don 't know . Please , I need a doctor . " I need a doctor . " Is he an alien , like me ? I don 't know . [ phone ringing ] Warning system , huh ? You lied , then , I think you 're lying now . You didn 't learn anything from me , did you ? Oh , I learnt enough . He 'll never believe you 're me . We 'll see about that . Nine O ' clock . [ intense music ] Is there anything else ? I told you everything I know about him . Don 't you have some identity of your own ? We found it easier to survive without one . We 're infinitely adaptable . And infinitely empty . What are you doin ' ? If he sees two of us , he 'll know something 's wrong . [ wind gushing ] It 's him , isn 't it ? Superboy . Lana . No , I 'm Lana . She 's this thing , this alien . No , she 's the alien . It wants your identity , it 'll kill you . - No . - Don 't come any closer . I have to . A-ask it a question , something you and I will only know . It 's got my memories . It 'll know the answer . Do you remember when .. I can 't see . No , she 'll kill you . She 's dying . No , not yet . I 've gotta get you to a hospital . - But what about her ? - I 'll come back for her . - No , do it now . - Do what ? Kill her , like you always do . Like I always do ? I lied . [ intense music ] No ! No ! What happened ? It could duplicate whatever was on the other end . But there wasn 't anything there . There never was . [ intense music ] [ theme music ]

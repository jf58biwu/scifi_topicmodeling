 Paul countering . Paul with a nice left . Paul just trying to stay away from him . Come on , man . Come on . Come on , now . Put him down . Put him down ! Ooh ! - Hey , man , watch it . - Come on , Upshaw . You and me , buddy . - Let 's go . - You 're a moron , Tiernan . - Let 's go . - You 're both morons , as far as I 'm concerned . - And who 's watching the floor ? - What 's his name . The Skink . Hey , guess who died this afternoon ? - Mrs. Richardson . - Face plant right in a bowl of pudding . I don 't suppose either one of you bothered to change her room . Oh , no , no . We left that for you . Ow ! Okay , party 's over , gents . - Why 'd you do that ? - Because rules are rules , Stan . - Aw ... - And I 'm the queen bitch around here . - Gung said we can watch the rest of the fight . - Yeah ? - Well , do I look like Gung to you ? - No . You got a better figure . You want to keep that hand , Hal , you better let go . How about a little sponge bath ? How about I take care of these wandering hands of yours ? Come here . You like strapping me down , don 't you ? Oh , yeah . I really get off on it . Hey , Gung . No TV after 9 : 00 . Do you understand ? Dr. Grago said they 're getting better , so ... Getting better . They don 't pinch his butt every time he walks into the room . Oh , God ! Don 't ! Somebody help me ! Somebody , please ! Please ! Please help me ! - Good morning . - Whatever tape you found in that V.C.R. Isn 't mine . Good , because I put it back in that drawer ... with all those other videos that aren 't yours . This definitely isn 't mine . No . This is Michelle Charters . She 's a registered nurse at a convalescent home in Worcester , Massachusetts . What happened to her ? According to Miss Charters , she was raped . The abrasions and contusions here would be consistent with her claims , as would be the medical report , which cites the kind of injury and tearing associated with sexual trauma . Where 'd you get this ? Violent Crimes ? No , the woman made the video herself . It seems that no one will believe her story . Why not ? Because she claims to have been raped by an invisible entity . A spirit being . I have several X-Files that document similar cases . I know . I 've been here since 6 : 00 this morning going through them . - Then you know none of them have ever been substantiated . - Not surprisingly . Given the emotional and psychological violence of rape , the face or identity of the attacker is often blurred or erased from memory . That he could be perceived as invisible is a logical leap from there . - Yes , but this case is different . - Why ? The victim has filed a lawsuit against the federal government . She seems to be certain who the spirit being is . - Mr. Arden . Hal Arden . - And you know him ... He 's been a patient where I work for about five years . Miss Charters , the facts of your case seem to contravene ... those of other cases we have on file . Right . You mean the other " woman raped by invisible man " cases ? How do you know it was him who attacked you ? He made advances toward me . And he said things , rude things ... Look , when you bathe somebody every day for five years , you get to know more about them than you really need to . An old man smells a certain way , and he feels a certain way . - I know this is hard for you . - No , this is the easy part . Hard is not being able to get disability leave or workman 's comp ... and having to go back to work with this ... guy . To continue our investigation , we 're gonna need some kind of evidence . - Physical or ... - Yeah , yeah , yeah . I know . I 've heard it . Unless you have hair or semen or fibers ... or whatever , you guys can 't build a case . That 's right . Look , I didn 't make this up , okay ? I was attacked . And I 'm not some kind of shrinking violet ... who would repress the memory of a rapist 's face . If I could positively I.D. Him or give you something ... to incriminate the man , I would . You gotta be kidding me . What do I think about her claims ? I should be in the Guinness record book . Hey , I 'm 74 years old . I 've got plumbing older than this building . Hmm ? And it don 't work much better , either . Thank you for sharing . Are you aware ... that you 're being named in a lawsuit against the federal government ? - I am ? - Did you ever threaten Miss Charters ? - What ? - Did you ever threaten Miss Charters ? Threaten ? It was harmless , for cryin ' out loud . Ever since this " sex harassment " fad , men can 't say what 's on their minds . - She says you made advances . - Hmm ? - Advances ? - If I told you you were a pretty woman , and I would like to show you some affection , would you be offended ? Huh ? Oh , I didn 't mean to step on your toes there . Uh , sir , there seems to be some confusion here . Yeah . I thought Nurse What 's-Her-Name said she was rogered by a ghost . I may have one foot in the grave , but I certainly can 't fly down hallways spreading amore . Apparently not . Apparently not . If that 's what it 's like ... If that 's what it 's like in heaven , Lord , take me now ! What do you think , Mulder ? - About the guy 's plumbing ? - About his story . I think this is gonna turn out to be a huge waste of time , just like all the other X - Files on entity rape . Unsubstantiated phenomena . But in a substantiated crime . Hey . Pay attention . You 'll take another bath with your clothes on . Five and a half bucks an hour , I don 't give a rat 's ass either way . Ten years ago , Excelsis was a leading facility ... in care and treatment of the elderly , then government funding was cut , and we were all but shut down . Only a few wings are operational now . - Is there still a medical staff ? - Not on site . Dr. Grago visits three times a week . Excelsis residents are very well looked after . We hold ourselves to a high standard of health maintenance and treatment . - What kind of treatment ? - We 've always specialized in the care ... of the late-life degenerative diseases : - Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's ... - We met with a patient today . - We prefer " resident , " actually . - We met a resident today ... who was described as having Alzheimer 's , but he actually seemed quite spry and alert . You 're speaking of Hal Arden . A man accused of assaulting Michelle Charters . Was he receiving special treatment ? You 'd have to speak to Dr. Grago . Hal has been here almost eight years now . We 're all quite fond of him . And we were extremely dismayed over this whole business with the lawsuit . Are you saying that you don 't believe Nurse Charters ' allegations of rape ? There 's something I 'd like to show you . - What did you tell ' em ? - I didn 't tell ' em anything . - Why are they still here ? - I don 't know , Stan . Now , you got to be more careful . - I am careful . - You 're gonna ruin it for all of us . If they find out , it all goes for nothin ' . I didn 't tell ' em anything . I 'm not gonna die in this godforsaken hole , do you hear me ? Oh , bug off , Stan . - Where did you get that ? - I know where he keeps ' em . Give me one , Stan . Huh ? I want another one too . You can 't handle another one . Oh , yeah ? Maybe I 'll just rat you out then , huh ? How would you like that ? This is Michelle Charters ' ? There are three separate insurance claims for accidents on the job . In April , she went to the state board and requested leave with full pay ... due to job-related emotional stress . The request was summarily rejected . - There 's more ... - I 'd like to review it myself , if that 's okay . - Certainly . - Miss Dawson , did you get a chance to see Michelle ... after the incident , to see the extent of her injuries ? I wasn 't here the night it happened , but I did see her the following day . - Then you know how badly she was hurt . - Yes . In your opinion , do you think she staged ... Excuse me , Miss Dawson ? We need help . Mr. Arden 's choking to death . See ? See what happened ? I told you you couldn 't handle any more . Call 9-1-1 . Hal ? Can you speak ? I think this man 's in ventricular fibrillation . I need 75 milligrams of lidocaine and one amp of epinephrine . - Stat . And get me a defibrillator ! - Yeah . - Okay . - He 's turning cyanotic . - Come on , Hal , you 've got to help me . - Come on , Hal . - One , two , three ... - The ambulance is on the way . I 'm losing him . What 's taking them so long ? Still no pulse . Where 's that crash cart ? Hal Arden 's been my patient since he came here eight years ago . - This really is a setback . - A setback ? Hal was part of a group of Alzheimer 's patients ... I 've been treating for the past 11 months . But Alzheimer 's isn 't treatable . It 's an experimental drug called Deprenyl , an enzyme inhibitor that increases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain . I 've read about it , but the clinical benefits are marginal at best . Well , yes . But these patients seem to be proving otherwise . They 've demonstrated cognitive abilities beyond anything that 's been reported . So , he was actually getting better ? Before he started the drug , he could hardly complete a sentence . Look , um , there 's not much to get excited about in my work . Most of these people are on the downhill slide . If I can make them comfortable , maybe prolong a life ... It 's about all they expect . - But to reverse an illness ... - Would it be possible for us ... to take a look at other patients in your test group ? - Sure , if you want to . - Yeah . - Where 'd you get that ? - Aw , it was Hal 's . Since he 's not here anymore , why can 't I have it ? Because you have enough . What I give you is enough . It 's our secret . Oh , come on , Gung . It 's makin ' me better . Too much is very bad . Very bad . No more for you . I want you to stand behind Ben , Eddie , because Ben 's taller . And , um , oh , Gloria , would you come on over here ? That man there , that 's Leo Kroitzer . During the Depression , he was a W.P.A. Artist . - Quite a good one too . - Hello , Mabel . You look lovely today . Is he receiving the same treatment as Hal Arden ? Yes . When he came to us , he couldn 't draw a circle . Now , well , you can see for yourself . Uh , you 'll have to excuse me . I 'm already behind on rounds . - Can I get a copy of Hal Arden 's autopsy results ? Thank you . - Of course . Can I sit down , Leo ? Leo , we 're with the F.B.I. We have some questions that we 'd like to ask you . Leo 's a brilliant artist , you know ? Oh , don 't be so modest , Leo . President Kennedy has one of his paintings in the White House . Doctor Grago tells us that you haven 't been able to work in years . - That the medicine has improved your ... - It ain 't the medication . What is it , then ? Okay , Rembrandt . It 's 6 : 00 . Dinnertime . Come on , Dorothy . Legs up and straight ahead . - Don 't want you gettin ' a flat tire . - Wait , Leo 's not finished . - Well , Leo can finish later . - No , no , he still has to draw the rest . - He 'll do it later , honey . - Leo , don 't make me embarrass you ... in front of your friends . Come on , Scully . Let 's get out of here . To find not just a treatment , but a cure for Alzheimer 's ... Mulder , do you realize how important that would be ? If it would keep anybody out of a place like that , it would be important . I wouldn 't say any of those people were exactly cured . - Any progress at all . - I hope somebody 's making progress . - We 're going home with a big goose egg . - Sir ? - Checking out of room 206 and 210 . - Certainly , sir . Angelo ? What if there 's a connection ? Between the rape case and the Alzheimer 's ? You mean , when they 're not drawing childlike pictures they 're brutal sex offenders ? Dr. Grago 's drug therapy produces acetylcholine . Too much cholinergic activity has been shown to cause ... a psychotic state very similar to schizophrenia . You think that Michelle Charters was raped by a 74-year-old schizophrenic ? - It 's possible . - An invisible 74-year-old schizophrenic . Well , maybe it 's not the medication . Maybe it 's the place itself . Are you saying that the building 's haunted ? Because if you are , you 've been working with me for too long , Scully . I 'm talking about an environmental reason behind what 's happening . Even the disinfectant couldn 't mask that smell . Who knows what 's breeding behind the walls or in the substructure . Some fungal contaminants have been known to cause ... delusions , dementia , violent behavior ... - Why wouldn 't it have affected the other residents ? - Maybe it has . I think you 're looking too hard , Scully , for something that 's not there . I think Michelle Charters concocted this story to get out of a job she hates . That lip required 13 stitches . The blow to her head resulted in a subdural hematoma . That 's quite a concoction . Look , I want to talk to a few more of the patients . We can catch the same flight out tomorrow night . This is gourmet fare . Now , be a good girl and open wide . No . No , no , please don 't . Please do ... Come on , open up , honey . Come on . - No , please don 't . I don 't wa ... - Open up . There we go . No ! Okay , that 's fine , Dorothy . Starve to death . See if I care . Why aren 't you eating your food , Leo ? What 's the matter ? It 's Dorothy . She needs more . We both do . - What you have is enough . - It 's not working for us . Not like it works for the others . - We need more . - No ! No . Eat your food , please . I 'll come back and pick up your tray . It 's okay , Dorothy . Don 't worry . I think Stan has some more hidden away somewhere . It 'll be all right . - Why are you being so stubborn ? - I 'm not . I like it here . Ayear ago you were begging to come live with us . - Well , things change . - Look , Dad , I am sorry about what happened to Mr. Arlen . - Arden . His name was Arden . - I 'm finished packing your things . I 'm going to make sure you didn 't forget anything . Don 't worry , Mrs. Kelley . Pull your car up front . - I 'll make sure he gets down okay . - Thank you . He 's gonna be just fine . - Can I help you ? - Yes , we 'd like to have a word with Mr. Phillips . - I 'm his daughter . What is this about ? - We 're with the F.B.I. We , uh , have a few questions concerning his medical treatment . He 's in there packing . I 'm about to take him home . Is there anything I can help you with ? It 's sad . My two little girls won 't even visit their grandfather . They 're too afraid to even come here . It 's hard for anyone to be here , including the residents . That 's whyJack and I decided that ... no matter what time he 's got left , we want him to spend it with us . - How many years has he been here ? - Almost three . We didn 't have any choice . Jack and I both work . The doctor said that he needed 24-hour nursing assistance . He doesn 't seem to need much assistance now . Has his improvement been that pronounced ? I thought I was bringing him here to die . They told me he 'd get worse . The physical deterioration , the dementia . And now it 's like he 's a different person . Do you have any idea why ? I suppose it has something to do with Dr. Grago 's treatment . Dad won 't talk to me about it . He 's just too angry . Oh , he was so angry when I brought him here in the first place . And now he 's angry that I want to take him home . I don 't know that he 's ever going to forgive me . You know , I 'd like to say I 'm gonna miss you , Stan , but the truth is , you are a royal pain in the butt . Hey ! Where are you goin ' ? Don 't make me chase you , old man . Hey ! What are you , a track star all of a sudden ? Okay , stop messin ' around , Stan . You crawl back in that window , right now . You crawl back in there . Don 't think I 'm coming over there to get you . I 'd just as soon let you fall and break your neck . Did you hear me , Stan ? You hear me ? Help me ! Somebody help me , please ! I 'm gonna fall ! Help ! Help me ! Give me your hand . - Come on . Come on ! - I can 't ... - Grab it ! - I can 't ! Oh , my God . They paged me this morning . I got a message ... an orderly fell out a fourth-floor window ? Apparently . Either that or he was pushed . What ? Was Stan involved ? That 's what we 're trying to determine . Stan was with him just prior to the accident . You 're not suggesting he could have done it ? There 's been two deaths here in the past 24 hours . - Stan 's been present before both . - No , no . That 's impossible . Stan Phillips has a degenerative hip disease . There 's no way he could even get up to the fourth floor on his own . - What about an elevator ? - The elevators in this place haven 't worked for years . - Maybe he was helped . - Helped ? By whom ? I don 't know . The postmortem on Hal Arden , did you get it yet ? Not yet . But they promised they 'll fax it to me today . - Can we check and see if it 's come in ? - Sure . - What do you expect to find ? - I 'm not sure exactly . Why are they questioning him ? It 's routine procedure . Are they gonna want to keep him here ? You 'll have to ask Dr. Grago . God ! If my mother was alive . How am I supposed to handle the whole floor by myself ? I don 't know , Michelle . I have other things to deal with right now . - So do I , and I would like some help . - Excuse me . - Are you the only one on ? - Yes ! Upshaw never showed up for work last night . I mean , nobody 's ever listening to me around here . I said there was something going on , and I told you it had to do with Mr. Arden and Mr. Phillips . Just forget it . Can you please explain to me what 's going on around here ? Shoo ! Shoo ! Go away ! Go ! Go away ! Leave me alone . Go back . Don 't come any closer . Go back in your room , Dorothy . If you need something , I 'll send an orderly in to see you . - Oh , no , no . Th-They 're in there . - Who ? All of them ! - There 's nobody in your room , Dorothy . - Here they come ! You 'll see . All right , now . You be nice . I don 't want any more of your dirty tricks . - Is she gonna be all right ? - Mm-hmm . No ! No , no , no . I don 't want to go back in there . No ! No , I don 't want ... It 's senile dementia . This is just an episode . You leave her be . D - D-Don 't you touch her ! Now , shoo ! Go ' way , go ' way , go ' way ! Don 't you get any ideas , mister . Excuse me . Now , don 't you follow her ! - This is it . - Is the toxicology there ? Yes . - There 's something here that shouldn 't be here . - What 's that ? Ibotenic acid . How did that get in his blood ? - What 's ibotenic acid ? - I think it 's a kind of poison . - Mulder ... - Scully , Hal Arden had ibotenic acid in his blood . Somebody poisoned him . Well , not necessarily . This is only a trace amount . But small amounts have been known to cause hallucinations , which is what one of your patients is having right now . But where did they get it ? Excuse me . You 've got to come quickly . Oh , my God ! - That 's fantastic . - What 's going on here ? Leo ? It 's incredible . You 've got an Asian orderly working here . What 's his name ? Uh , Gung , I think . - Do you know where he is ? - Somewhere down in the basement . Upshaw . - You must believe me . I didn 't kill him . - It 's your mushroom crop . - Yes . - Who else would have buried him there ? Why were you growing them ? For medicinal purposes . Were you feeding them to the residents here ? Yes , but only in small amounts . - Why ? - Because it makes them feel better . It makes them feel better , or it kills them ? - No . - What kind of mushrooms are they ? It 's from my prefecture , in my country . They 've been used for centuries . - For what purpose ? - In my country , our customs are different . You 're not in your country now . You 're hired here to care for these people under our guidelines . Where I come from , many generations live under one roof . As children , our grandparents live with us . We feel a duty to take care of them . It isn 't like that in this country . We respect our old people as we respect our ancestors . We don 't send them away to die , like Stan and Hal . These people are given excellent medical care . But they are not treated with respect . Hal 's family never came to visit him once . And the orderlies ... treat the residents worse than dogs . - No one is mistreated here . - You 're not here to see . All right . Who killed the orderly ? Who buried him in that room ? Something ... has gone very wrong . The mushrooms we take to speak with the dead , to see our ancestors in the spirit world . But the spirit in this place is very angry , and the souls that died here continue to suffer . And now they ... have been awakened . Are you saying that a spirit killed this man Upshaw ? Yes . They 've taken revenge for their mistreatment . How are the mushrooms taken ? Dried , mixed with many herbs , made into powder . Well , I think the first thing we should do is make sure nobody else takes them . You check on the other patients . Gung , come with me . Let 's go . Come in , please . Someone 's taken them all . - I think you 're right , Scully . - About ? What 's been happening here is the result of the medication . Not the medication the doctor 's been giving them . Mulder , mushrooms aren 't medication . They taste good on hamburgers , but they don 't raise the dead . Shamans have been using them for centuries to gain entrance to the spirit world . I think you 've been reading too much Carlos Castaneda . All right , ask any anthropologist , then . I know , a shaman gets intoxicated , he has ... dreams or hallucinations , and he interprets them . I don 't think it 's any more magical than that . I don 't know how else to explain what 's happening here . Well , I think if anything , these mushrooms are a poison to the system . And I think that 's what killed Hal Arden . And raped Michelle Charters and killed those two orderlies ? Something 's been unleashed here , Scully . I don 't know how to explain it , but it has something to do with those pills . Daddy ? Daddy , what are you taking ? What are you putting in your mouth ? Go away ! You go away . Go away ! Go away . You leave me ... Leave us alone ! Go on ! Oh , no . You , run . Run while you can . Go on , run ! Ru ... Go away . Go away ! You leave us alone ! - Dorothy , I need your help ! - Leo . You leave Leo alone ! You leave him alone ! Leo ! Leo ! Leo . You leave him ... You leave ... Oh . Oh , no . No . Stop . Don 't ! Stop that . Help me , please . Mulder ? What 's going on ? Mulder ? - Mulder ? - Scully ! Turn off the water main . Turn off the water main ! They 're trapped in the bathroom and it 's filling with water . - What ? - Where 's the main water shutoff ? - I don 't know . - Gung will know . Keep trying the door . You 've gotta get up . Come on . We gotta get up . Come on . It 's stuck ! See if you can find something to force it with . I can 't open the drains . Please . My father needs help . My father took something . I 'm afraid he 's dying . You stay with him . I 'll get help . Dr. Grago ! Dr. Grago . - Sealed tight . - Do you have any atropine in your kit ? Uh , I might . Yes , I think so . Stan Phillips has gone into convulsions . I think he might have poisoned himself . It 's all right . Just hang on . They 're gone . They 're gone ! They 're all gone . - You okay , Mulder ? - Yeah . Fine . You all right ? In response to the series of unexplained incidents ... at the Excelsis Dei Convalescent Home , the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has assumed ... all administrative authority at the facility . They have detected trace amounts of ibotenic acid in more than half the residents tested , though these levels have dissipated rapidly . Dr. John Grago has been replaced as head physician at the facility , and his trial use of the drug Deprenyl has been suspended . For his admitted part in manufacturing and distributing an illicit substance , Gung Bittawon was remanded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service ... and is awaiting repatriation to Malaysia . There are reportedly no efforts being made to study the mushrooms . The federal government has settled Michelle Charters 'lawsuit out of court , though no clear blame has been placed . Witnesses to the events have been unreliable , due to dramatic relapses ... and a general reversal in their progress with Alzheimer 's disease . I 'm gonna go now , Daddy . I 'll see you again soon . Maybe next week . Subtitles Provided By Captions , Inc . Los Angeles

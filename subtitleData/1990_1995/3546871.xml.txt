 Okay , ladies , move out . Follow me . Come on , Amy , let 's go . Let 's ditch . Okay . Where did you get those ? My mom 's purse . You are so busted . She won 't know the difference . She doesn 't even know I 'm here today . Come on , hurry up . Dork . Shut up . Well , we 've got a Jane Doe . I guess she could be a runaway . She 's not a street kid . Not with these nails . Hit-and-run ? I don 't think so . She 's too far from the road to be tossed by a car . Looks like she 's been hit by every bug in South Florida , though . Poor baby 's been eaten alive . Smells like beer . You are much too young to be out drinking , sweetheart . Maybe the poor thing was just coming home from a party . She hasn 't been here that long . Check her lividity . I 've got double-lividity . Her blood settled twice . She 's been moved . Then it 's a body dump . So we are in search of a crime scene . 1x11 Camp Fear Calleigh , please . Coming . Hmm ... What do you think of this ? Okay , well ... faint tread impression , knobby tire , narrow track width . Put it all together , it spells ATV . Pretty fragile , though . You think you can cast them ? Hair spray . I like it . Detective Delacroix says guy 's a wharf rat . So do we have a name on him ? Willie Stango . His ex-wife came by this morning to check up on him . Said he 'd been ducking her calls for a week . Ugh . Okay , that 's bad . Oh , god , it smells well done . Well done . Oh , yeah . That looks like someone torched him . No signs of forced entry . Probably someone he knew . Like a bitter ex-wife ? Got milk ? It 's all over the place . A cell phone . It 's still working . Lots of missed calls . That 's a good place to start . Liver temp says she died between three and five this morning . Welts on her body appear to be insect bites : ants , mosquitoes , god knows what else . Blunt force trauma to the right aspect of the forehead an inch from the midline . Blood loss could 've led to endotoxic shock but I 'll have to do more testing . Okay , so somebody hit her and dumped her . The cause of death is still uncertain . Could 've been an accident . Teenage girl doesn 't wind up by the side of the road dead and it 'd be an accident . What about sexual assault ? Minor vaginal tearing around the opening . And this . Diaphragm . Fifteen years old and she was planning on having sex . Or someone was . Maybe someone who didn 't get their way . Here 's the tox you wanted . Oh , okay . Cool room . Ruben , have you seen Megan ? She had court today . I thought she had court yesterday . She stopped by , told me to give you this . Uh , your Jane Doe 's blood alcohol was 0.0 . What ? So she smelled of beer but didn 't drink any ? Okay , that 's odd . Not as odd as this - -her pro-time 's up to about 25 seconds . Her blood wasn 't clotting ? Well , she could 've been taking a blood thinner . I 'm still running more tests . No , a blood thinner would 've caused extensive bruising . Especially with her injuries . And there 's not a bruise on her . We 've got no ID , no primary crime scene and no cause of death , right ? Pretty much sums it up . Well , we know she was doing one thing before she passed away . She was breathing . Yes , breathing air filled with contaminants . I 'll swab her nasal passages and sinus cavities . Okay . Keep me posted . Tread marks are from DTP mud gator 's quad-claw design . Standard issue on 650 series ATVs . Got some nice scuffing on the outside ribs . Nice work . I 've got a standard issue situation here , too . I think it 's some type of , uh ... uniform . It 's a laundry mark used to separate identical quantities of clothing . An invisible laundry mark , just like our Jane Doe who 's not been reported missing yet , has she ? Detective Sevilla has blanketed all the local agencies with her pictures , but no hits yet . Okay . By the way ... a present for you from Alexx . Nasal mucus . And it isn 't even my birthday . Sorry about that . Hey . Hey . You mind if I observe ? When have I ever ? So , Mr. Observer , what do you see ? Uh , partial thickness burns of the lips , tongue and oral mucosa . Stomach lining appears to be red and inflamed . What about the lungs ? Swelling of the main stem bronchi . Release of edema fluid . Meaning ? Meaning he was fried from the inside . And the heat from the burns blocked off his airway . Not bad , not bad at all . You know , Speed , anytime you want to cross over to our side of the street ... Do you have any idea what could 've caused it ? No . We 're running tox . But if you want first dibs on the stomach lining ... Well , yeah . Great thing about the nose is it acts like a filter . Everything we breathe gets trapped inside - - spores , dirt , live dust mites ... Ugh . Remind me never to breathe again . Bingo . That 's pollen . Excuse me . You get something on the laundry mark ? Yes , Pharos Academy ... a juvenile detention camp for girls in Southwest Dade . Ah , tough love . Parents ship their children off when they lose control . Last chance before the courts get involved . Yes , well , now we 're involved . At least we know what Jane Doe was running from . Sergeant Marcus Cawdrey , Horatio Caine , Calleigh Duquesne , Miami Crime Lab . How do you do , Sergeant ? Hello . Pleasure . There 's been no crime committed on this property . I can tell you that . Well , how about a couple of miles up the road ? We found one of your girls . Well , that 's not one of my cadets . I 've never seen that girl before . This is not one of your girls ? No , sir . Excuse me . Sergeant Cawdrey , how many ATV 's do you have on this ... Take a look at this . It 's a match . It also means that we 're going to be here for a while . I don 't know how that ATV got off property . Access is strictly limited to instructors . What about this young lady right over here ? Senior Cadets are considered part of our staff . Okay , we 'll need a list of those names . These girls are minors . I can 't give you anything without parental permission . Okay , we 'll get it right after we inform their parents ... they 're part of an ongoing murder investigation . Now , let 's talk about the property for a minute , Sergeant . I noticed that you don 't have a fence . In life there are no fences . We rely on a strict code of discipline . We monitor everything these girls do . We tell them when to eat , sleep and shower . When to go to the bathroom ? Yes , ma 'am . Extreme problems require extreme measures . And do those measures ever get too extreme ? That can never happen . We have safety protocols in place . Do you recognize this shirt ? Looks like one of ours . And the number ? Barracks two . Ladies ... Sergeant on deck ! Heads down ! This won 't be necessary , Sergeant . We have to earn the right to face others with dignity and respect , sir . Senior Cadet Barreiro is one of our success stories . She used to steal , fight and disrespect her parents . Now she 's planning on going to college . Isn 't that right , Senior Cadet ? Yes , Sergeant ! Congratulations , Cadet . Now , sergeant am I to understand the young ladies are issued uniform shirts ? Yes , sir . Three . Three shirts . What is the significance of the single yellow bar . Denotes a cadet first class , sir . Okay , could I see them , please ? Yes , sir . Cadet first class , locker inspection ! Cadet Julie Morales , sir , front and center . Cadet Morales , you 're missing a shirt . Where 's your third shirt ? Sir , this Cadet does not know , sir . Okay , maybe I can be helpful . We believe that we found the missing shirt on this young lady . Does she seem familiar to you ? Sir , no , sir ! Okay . I 'm going to go through your locker , okay ? Is this your boyfriend ? No , that 's my brother . Eyes front , cadet ! Horatio . Same color as Jane Doe 's . Yes , it is . Sergeant , we 're going to have to process this whole barracks . On what grounds ? Bad hair day . What have you got ? I 'm not sure . I 'm not sure about any of this . I hear you . Like , why would anyone sneak into a detention camp ? Maybe she was desperate . Is this going to take much longer ? My girls need to get back to their routine . Actually , uh ... actually , we are finished . I am going to need one other thing , though . I need your belt and your pants . What for ? Why don 't you tell me ? Managed to extract one hundred incomings from Willie 's cell phone . Delacroix 's tracking them through teleshore . So , Mr. Wizard , you , uh ... any idea yet what killed our guy ? Yeah , he had gas . Gasoline to be more precise . All the way down to his stomach lining . Someone poured gas down his throat and lit him up . Human molotov cocktail . The interesting thing about that sample is that it has trace amounts of sodium . I see . Sodium and gasoline comes from saltwater contamination . There 's a lot of gas around that marina . You think Willie Stango owned a boat ? Could be . Could be ? Could be . Let 's go find out . Never fumed one of these before . Talk to me , guys . Tested the diaphragm for semen . Negative . But then I thought I spotted a partial ... He spotted more than that . Jane Doe 's print on her own diaphragm . Hardly the crime of the century . Not just her prints . Plural . Two sets . Two sets ? Interesting . The substance on Marcus 's zipper is definitely human blood . DNA is on it right now . Well , tell them there 's more coming . There 's some evidence of a wipe-down , but dollars to donuts this blood 's from our vic . Yeah , but we still don 't know where she was killed . Or who killed her . That 's correct . You know what , swab the intake system and the air filter . ATV 's got to breathe , too . Yeah , Horatio . Okay . Our victim 's name is Dara Winters . Her mother just filed a missing persons report less than two hours ago . She was a teen model . She was so beautiful . Yes , she was . We were planning a trip to Milan . It was her first time . When was the last time you saw your daughter , Mrs. Winters ? Last night , about eight o 'clock . She was going out with some friends . I 'm going to need those names . Do you remember what she was wearing ? A red halter top , a black miniskirt . Actually , we argued about it . You had a fight ? Why did it take you so long to report her missing ? Sometimes I wouldn 't see my daughter all morning . But in the afternoon , I called some of her friends then I called the police . Did she have a friend named Julie Morales ? Julie Morales ? No . Because we believe she was at a Juvenile Detention Camp ... named Pharos Academy . A detention camp ? Why would she be there ? I don 't know . Maybe to visit a friend . I don 't think so . Okay , is it possible , Mrs. Winters that you didn 't know everything about your daughter ? Lieutenant Caine , do you have teenage children ? No , I don 't . Dara was an " A " student . She didn 't smoke , she didn 't do drugs . She was going to save her modeling money to go to college . Did you know Dara had a P.O. Box ? No . No return address . Signed by someone named " Louise . " Well , she went to grammar school with a girl named Louise ... something . She was my whole life . Mrs. Winters , we 're going to find out who did this to your daughter . Okay ? Yes . Super-vee , twin-engines , 900 horsepower each . Engines on that baby cost more than your car . Maybe more than your car . Yeah , well , our friend Willie wasn 't exactly living large . Gasoline . Yeah , and there 's gas cans under here . Yep . That 's a lot of tanks for a little boat . Obviously not for his boat . Obviously . The idiot was siphoning . Yeah , but why steal cheap gas at a buck-thirty ? He could 've gone to the corner pump . Maybe it wasn 't cheap . Let 's find out . Crystals we found on the barracks floor are ordinary table salt . So somebody 's guilty of seasoning . The yellow substance found in the air filter of the ATV ... matches the pollen found in Dara 's nasal cavity . Lignum vitae . The hardest wood in the world . The U.S. Navy almost wiped them out during World War II ... using them for propeller pins . They 're very rare . The only places that they grow down here are in Southwest Dade or in the keys . And there are none on the grounds of Pharos Academy . I checked . So the ATV was where Dara was killed . It 's too bad it can 't tell us what happened . Maybe it can . Hang on a second . Horatio . Okay ... thank you . Well , there you have it . blood from your camouflaged pants ... matches a 15-year-old girl you 've never seen . Can you explain that ? I already told you . I never laid eyes on this girl before in my life . Right . But we found her blood on your zipper . I don 't know how it got there . Look , I 'm very sorry for this girl and her family but if she was in my camp , then she was trespassing . Okay , fair enough . Then why don 't we discuss the ride that night . You got it all wrong . Last time I rode that ATV was yesterday morning . I ran it out to the chapel then to the latrine and back to admin . Whatever you guys are thinking , I didn 't touch any of these girls . I 'll take a lie-detector test ... Whatever you want . All we need is your prints and a nasal swab . Knock yourself out . AFIS kicked back nothing on the second set of diaphragm prints . Do you think his might match ? I don 't know . No bruising , no semen ... and anyone could 've ridden this ATV . Yeah , but the blood on his zipper . I think there might be another explanation . Are you thinking passive transfer ? For now . Hey , man . Where have you been ? Waiting at DNA . They 're back-logged into next week . I got to talk to Megan about that . Well , stand in line , because I left her three messages already . Yeah ? Something 's going on . Yeah . What 'd you get ? Willie 's saliva on the last inch of that hose . Means that it wasn 't shoved all the way down his throat . Means he was siphoning . Look at this . Gas in those tanks was straight-up park place . High octane ; 120-plus . It 's got zero alcohols or oxygenates . Yeah , it 's used for , uh ... high-performance , large bore engines . Super-vee 's . He was stealing from his neighbors . The thing about 120-plus is that it 's very dangerous . It 's got a low flash point . So you 're not even supposed to store it in the sun . Yeah , you can 't buy it at the pump , either . Willie wasn 't exactly making friends . Well , you wouldn 't know it from his cell phone log . Delacroix sent over this fax . Willie 's last hundred incomings ; seventy-four came from one person . Ex-wife ? No , someone named motor . Willie 's phone stalker is one Timmy Diehl , A.K.A. Motor . He 's a Bal Harbour Brat . Leads one of those jet ski clubs . How 'd you get him to come down ? I told him we found Willie . Where 's Willie ? That 's what we wanted to talk to you about . Hey , motor , what do you got under there ? 800 cc 's ? Try 1250 , bored out . Wow , that 's a big engine for a little machine . It 'll top-end anything in this marina . Engine that size really begs for the good stuff , doesn 't it ? You know what I 'm talking about - -gas , 120-plus . Hey , do you think you could outrun that ? It 's got triple 575'S . Get me within a five-mile radius of where the body was dumped , please . Lignum vitae is a short tree with a heavy pollen . Fall rate 's about twelve centimeters per second . Weather service had wind out of the southwest at three-to-four knots . With your average eight-foot tree ... you 'll get a pollen footprint of about fifty yards . So she took her last breath within fifty yards of the pond ... and just inside the academy perimeter . It 's about three miles from where we found the body . So somebody wanted her off property , didn 't they ? You see these outgoing tracks right here ? Yeah . They 're deeper and about half an inch wider . So that says to me ... the ATV came in with one passenger and probably went out with two . It also says to me that Jane Doe was here . I 've got something . Got a red halter top ... and a black miniskirt . This , ladies , is our primary crime scene . Whoa . You picked up a few passengers . Hey , leeches . Take a look at that , please . Yes , it 's a leech . Can leave his jaw behind . Instead , let 's use some good old-fashioned saline solution . May I ? Bye . Take care . All right . So ... saline solution . Salt . You got it . Can you believe these little piggies ... will engorge themselves up to ten times their original size ? Leeches just fascinate me . Leech saliva . Medical marvel , you know . It contains enzymes that expand your blood vessels . Kind of like viagra . Well , not quite . Unlike viagra it contains a mild anesthetic so you don 't feel the bite . Don 't you hate it when that happens ? It also has plenty of hirudin . Nature 's own anticoagulant . You know , my mother still doesn 't believe me ... that they use leeches in modern microsurgery . Yeah , well , let her lose a finger she 'll become a believer . Just slap this little mouth right on to any reattached limb ... and watch them do the housework . Vacuuming up all that used blood so it doesn 't cause gangrene . Which explains why there was no bruising on Dara Winters . The leeches removed the surface blood . The high level of anticoagulant acted like a blood thinner , so she never clotted . Those bites ... they bled for hours after the leeches finished feeding . It 's the beer . What about the beer ? The scent of beer is like catnip for leeches . When I was little , we used to pour beer on leeches and watch them whip into a feeding frenzy . That 's why she had so many leeches on her body . At least she never felt it . Yeah . Got a minute ? So we 've been going through the letters that we found in Dara 's room ... and they seem to be written in some type of a code . It 's typical for fifteen-year-old girls . Listen to this . " Tell Q.B. No more . You have to get the hell out of there . " This girl has a secret , doesn 't she ? Our leeches just gave up their secret . You recovered the rest of her blood ? In over half the samples . And lord knows how many more are burrowed out there , digesting . It was death by leech . It was death by leech . Well , they may have killed her ... but they didn 't move her body , did they ? Megan , it 's Horatio . Call me on my cell , will you ? Sergeant Marcus ? No match on pollen or prints . He 's clean . He 's clean . So that means the answer is right over here . All right , ladies , listen up . We need you all to roll up your pant legs . Ladies , we found salt crystals in your barracks and ... we believe they were used to remove a certain parasite . Come on , ladies , double time ! You heard her , " Louise " . That 's your nickname , isn 't it ? Sir , this Cadet 's name is Julie Morales , sir ! Will that be all , sir ? No , ma 'am , it 's not . Now you . Let 's go . Well , there you have it . Hey , sport , how you doing ? Okay , let me help you out with this . See that there ? Now , that 's 120-plus high-performance gasoline . It 's what you thought you were buying . And this one ... is not exactly the Ferrari of fuels , is it ? And we got that from the gas tank of your jet ski . So , Willie was cutting your 120-plus with gas from the corner pump ... and trying to sell it to you for the real deal . That bunk locked up my engine . It cost me three grand . Yeah ... I 'd be pissed . Sounds like motive for murder . What are you talking about ? Well , you know , the guy 's ... ripping you off and you know he 's siphoning . So , you light him up . Look , I didn 't kill anybody . Phone records got you for stalking . 'Cause he was ducking me . Seventy-four calls ? He never answered . But he managed to pick up the phone the morning he died . Look . I star-67'd him . And the minute he picked up , the phone line went dead . Horatio . Yeah ? Message for you , from Megan . Excuse me ? Message from Megan . Thank you . Um ... hang on a second . This , uh ... this can 't be right . She asked that you try not to contact her anymore . Thank you . I wanted to cut Julie a break . I was on bed check . I heard talking coming from number two after lights out . And that 's when you saw Dara ? Yeah , I didn 't know who she was . The senior cadet is being interrogated in the other room . I need you to talk to me . Okay ? I don 't want to get in any more trouble . Then you just have to help us out , Julie . We just want to find out what happened to Dara and why she came to you . She was my best friend . I told her she had to leave immediately . I escorted her to the front gate and I left her there . See , leeches need a water source . And those leech bites on your legs indicate to me that you were at the pond . And going by your record ... and your history of violence ... I think you roughed her up and you left her there . And then you found her dead the next morning , then you dumped her body a few miles away ... just to cover it up . I found her by the pond at 0700 during morning rounds . I drove up and she was just lying there . I didn 't want to get in trouble for not reporting her the night before . I 'm sorry . Why did Dara cut her hair ? She hated it . Hated those stupid clothes , too . Why was she running away , Julie ? Did it have anything to do with why you assaulted her mom ? We talked to your parents . They told us the whole story . They didn 't tell you my story . They didn 't believe me . No one ever believed me . I 'll believe you ... if you tell me the truth . Dara was sick of the modeling . She was sick of everything . Always having to be perfect . You 're beautiful , you 're going to be great . But queen bitch wouldn 't let her quit . You mean her mother ? She made her do a lot of things . What kind of things ? No , mom , please . Dara . No , mom ... Dara . Please . Her mom always told her : " no choir girl ever made the A-list . " So , Willie was siphoning gas as a side gig . Which means he was sucking in a lot of fumes . That explains his milk Jones . He was trying to settle his stomach . Gasoline has only one use . To ignite . So what ignited it ? I don 't know , maybe fillings in his mouth caused a spark . Not according to his dental records . This guy had perfect teeth . Maybe static electricity . A heck of a shag carpet . Maybe he had some build-up from it . You know when you 're pumping gas ... you 're not supposed to get in and out of your car ? Or talk on the cell phone . Lithium batteries put out 3.7 volts of electricity . What do you want ? I guess he had to take that phone call . Trip out . They say these things can kill you . Thanks . Bet you even money that 's airborne pollen . Let 's print this car . Will someone please tell me why I 'm here ? They took my car . Beautiful girl . Sad eyes , though . What the hell is this ? You were out there the night Dara died , weren 't you ? Of course not . We found a very specific airborne pollen on the headrest of your car ... which would put you within fifty yards of where she took her last breath . She was running away from you , wasn 't she ? To Julie . She would go wherever Julie was . So you drove out there ... to bring her back to bring her back to everything ... she was running away from , right ? Dara ? What have you done to your hair ? ! Dara , you stay there ! I 'm not gonna do it anymore . I won 't go back ! You don 't have a choice . It 's my life ! No , life is about making sacrifices . I 'm gonna tell ! I 'm gonna tell everyone ! Shut up ! No , Dara , don 't ! Dara ! And then you left her there . No , I was expecting her to come home the next day . Dara was special . She was going places . Anyone could tell . But she was throwing it all away . And for what ? A date at the mall ? High school football on Friday nights ? Some kind of average Briar Bay existence ? To three-quarters of the world that sounds like a slice of heaven . She was running away from you because you made her home-life hell . All I did was set up auditions . I was trying to help her to succeed . You were forcing her to market herself to get modeling jobs . Right ? Now , we have a second print on her diaphragm ... - -your prints . We matched it to the prints we found in your car . " No choir girl ever made the A-list . " Isn 't that what you told her ? No , you don 't understand . No , I don 't . I told you that I would figure out who did this , didn 't I ? Knock , knock . Come on in . Me and the guys are going for a beer . You want to come ? Mind if I take a rain check ? You all right ? Megan resigned . She said that work was too much of a reminder of her husband 's death . It 's a shame . She was a good criminalist . She was . She was indeed . I almost walked once . I 'll see you tomorrow . Yep .

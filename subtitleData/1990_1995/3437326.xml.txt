 Excuse me . How could Miss Graham call that a quiz ? It took the whole period . She called it a quest- - A combination quiz and test . So if Miss Graham is a combination teacher and wanker does that make her a tanker or a weacher ? I can 't believe I blanked on number three . Shh ! Shh ! Shh ! - Which Gary . - What ? I heard my name . She said , " Gary " . Paula Sparks ? I guarantee she wasn 't talking about you . Which Gary ? The geeky blond guy with the B.O. ? No way . Yeah . He 's in this dream I keep having . She had a dream about me ? A beautiful babe had a dream about me ? It 's always the same . We studying in Ms. Bouvier 's french class but no one else in there and it starts to get warm . So I take off my sweater . Oh , my God . Yes , yes , yes . - Then he goes to kiss me ... - Yes , yes , yes . - ... and it 's , like , so amazing . - The Monroe Doctrine ! Idiot ! I could have gotten a hundred . - Shh . I can 't hear . - Wow ! That last part is so hot . I can 't believe you dreamt that about Gary . Wallace . - Is that shirt a J. Crew ? - No ! I score with Paula Sparks . And I don 't even know what I did . - It was just her dream , Gary . - But I was in that dream doing things , unspeakable things- - Things I could be replaying over and over in my mind . What are Dad and Chett doing here ? LISA : Maybe they came by to share a mocha-chino . Dad and Chett ? Yeah , right . I wish I could hear what they were saying . - I 'll turn it up . - There 's no way I 'm working here- - Toasting low-fat muffins for a bunch of frasier taping cold heads ? I pulled a lot of strings to get you this job - so you 're taking it . - You had to pull springs to get me a four-dollars-an-hour job ? You 've had six months to do better . That 's plenty of time to get your life on track . - I 've been fine-tuning my resume . - Look , Chett ... perhaps it 's time we set some limits for your own good . - Define " limits . " - Okay . If you fail to keep this job I 'm afraid we 're going to have to reassess your living situations . Meaning if I get fired you 're going to kick me out of the house ? - That 's one way to look at it , yes . - Harsh . Well , let 's go talk to Mr. Brinkman , shall we ? - Hey ! Do you mind ? - So Chett has to get a job . Big deal . - How about two out of three . - Sure . This is unbearable . I need to know how Paula 's dream ended . Is there any way you can help me ? I 've got it . I 'll give you a machine that will let you go inside her dreams . - You could do that ? - I could go inside her dream ? Sure . Paula 's bound to dream about you again tonight and when she does , you will be there in person . Can I come along ? You want to watch Paula 's sexy dream about me ? - What else am I going to do ? - Melrose place is a rerun . The dream chair hold two . Sweet ! Let 's do it . Cozy . A little frankensteinish , but if it does the job ... - What do these buttons do ? - The top one sends you through the dimensional wall and into the dreams of whoever you program the chair for . The other 's for lower-back massage . - Ah . - Ah . There 's one rule about dream space . You have to get back through the dream door before the person wakes up , or else . - Or else what ? - Your astral self will be forced out of the dreamscape and deposited in the conious mind . - Is that bad ? - Just get out in time , okay ? Gary ? - Did you hear what I just said ? - Yeah . Something about leaving a deposit . Let 's blow . I don 't want to miss any good parts . Did you bring the camera ? - Ready ? - Punch it . [ Both Yelling ] Are we in ? Is this Paula Spark 's dream ? It 's got to be . This is Ms. Bouvier 's classroom . Get pictures . - My camera just turned into a cove . - The fun 's just beginning . I had my birthday party pictures in there . Ooh , ooh , ooh . There 's Paula and me . Just like she said . [ Seductive Jazz Fusion Music ] Now she 's going to take off her sweater and now I kiss her . [ Gasps ] - Ms. Bouvier ! - Gary , what is going in here ? - You said you loved me . - Oh , baby . He did ? He said he loved me . In France , when two women love the same man there is only one course action which is truly satisfying . - Tongue bath ! - Death by fire . - Burn him . - ALL : Burn him ! Burn him ! - No ! - Burn him ! Burn him ! - No ! - Burn him ! Burn him ! - I guess this is the part is missed . - This bites . Let 's get out of here . Unless you 'd rather watch me fry . Um ... - So , how was Paula 's dream ? - It sucked , thank you so much . I 'm starving . How long we been gone ? - Five hours . It 's 4 : 00 a.m. - What ? - It only felt like a few minutes . - That 's dream time . Well , now it 's snack time . You up for a fridge raid ? Hey , what 's he doing up ? He must be stressed about starting work tomorrow . - He probably feels nervous . - And vulnerable . Hey , let 's go rub it on . Hiya , big brother . Well , if it isn 't Captain Colon and his sidekick butt boy . You girls run out of slumber party games ? You 're very clever with words , Chett . I bet that 'll help you tomorrow at your new job . You really think I 'm worried about some stupid , little job ? You 're talking to a man who can field-strip an m-16 wearing a blindfold and handcuffs . Question is , can you do it wearing a hairnet and a name tag ? - You 're dead ! - [ Both Yelling ] Hey , hey , hey ! The Truck City Triplets . [ To " The Lone Ranger " ] : # Get a truck , get a truck , get a truck , truck , truck # # Get a truck , get a truck , get a truck , truck , truck # # Get a truck , get a truck , get a truck , truck , truck ... # - # Low down-payment terms . # - They make me happy . I 'm not wasting any more time on you skid marks . I 'm going to go get some shut-eye . You know , the fun doesn 't have to stop . Have fun in Chett 's head . We 'll bring you some ... - What 's that ? - Your camcorder . Sorry . Why are we in Java Man ? Chett must be dreaming about work . [ Shattering ] [ Echoing ] : Drop another cup you lose your job . You lose your job , you 're out of the house . Yes , sir . Trying my best , sir . Sorry , sir . [ Echoing ] : Waiter , if you can 't make me a decent cafe au lait you 're out of the house . Coming right up , sir . [ Echoing ] : If you can 't make these dishes shine you 're out of the house ! # Do the job , do the job # # Do the job , do the job # # Do the job , do the job , do the job , do the job # # Do the job , do the job , do the job , do the job # # Or you 're out of the house . # So , what do you think 's bugging Chett ? I can 't work any faster . I was trained to serve my country , not cappuccinos . [ Echoing ] : You were born to serve cappuccino . [ Alarm Blaring ] Gary , something 's wrong . We 'd better get out of here . - Gary ? - I 'll be with you in a sec , Wy . Cream or sugar , ladies ? Gary , it 's closing . Come on ! Uh-oh . I don 't even drink coffee . - Where 's Gary ? - The dream door closed . - He didn 't get out in time . - Chett woke up ? So , what 's that mean ? Oh , no . [ Army Cadence : ] # I don 't know but I 've been told # # This loaf of bread seems mighty old . # - Occupado , Mr. Roboto . - Right . I just wanted to say ... good luck on the new job . You feeling okay ? You know , I 'm getting a little sick and tired of everybody thinking I can 't handle the job . I 've handled worse than this stupid little tea party . [ Chuckling ] - Any sign of Gary ? - Kind of . Poor Chett . Gary 's trapped inside his head - and he doesn 't even have a clue . - Poor Chett ? Poor Gary . How 'd this happen ? Gary was in Chett 's dream but when Chett woke up , no more dream so Gary got dumped into Chett 's conscious mind . So what do we do ? Our only shot is to modify the dream chair . Then we 'll rescue Gary . I 'll start on the chair . See if you can make contact with Gary . Tell him to hang tight . I 'll have him out soon . Hey , Chett , ready for the big day ? [ Belching ] Good one . Caught me with my mouth open . - Have you seen ... Gary . - No ... I haven 't but I have seen the future and you 're in for some pain . Ah ! Oh ! Hey . What the ... ? - Never mind . - Gary ? Is that you ? Are you in there ? Don 't worry . Lisa has a plan . We 'll have you out soon . If you understand , give me a sign . What are you looking at ? May I ... clear your soiled cups and plates ? That 's right . Don 't make eye contact with me . I 'm just the dirty little busboy doing his dirty little job . - Donnelly , table seven needs water . - Right , Mr. Brinkman . Table seven . - Uh , what 's the joke , Chett ? - No joke . Just equalizing the pressure in my sinuses . - And my ears . - You making fun of me ? No , sir . Absolutely not , sir . Excuse me , sir . Oh ! What the devil 's happening to me ? It 's just a job . Don 't let it stress you out . You 're strong enough , you 're tough enough ... GARY : ... and doggone it , people like you . Huh ? - Hiya , Chett . - [ Gasps ] Yeah . How do you think I feel ? This is ... no way . You got to be kidding me . - You 're not real . - Relax . I 'll be gone soon but first , since I 'm stuck here we 're going to have a little fun . - It 's payback time , Chett . - Payback ? Remember when you dunked me in paint ? It was a joke ! Who could forget all those pink bellies ? [ Yelling ] And your favorite Wyatt torture- - The nipple twister . [ Yelling ] You 're the devil , aren 't you ? The devil in the form of Gary Wallace ! - Nope . Just Gary Wallace . - [ Yelling ] [ Loud Hissing ] Lisa , what 's taking so long ? She 's not ready . I need more time . Or what ? The dilithium crystals are going to blow ? Hand me the triangulating bore probe . - Huh ? - The red thing . And don 't drop it or you 'll trigger an ice age . Donnelly , where have you been ? I need you out there bussing tables . I 'm on it . - Get going . - I 'm trying . I can 't seem to move my feet . I need to move my feet . Make it stop ! Chett . Chett . - Chett , are you on medication ? - Nope . Just keeping the customers happy . I swear , as soon as I finish my dance I 'm bussing tables . Oh . Whoa-oh ! Mr. Brinkman , please don 't fire me for what I 'm about to do . I want my job . I need my job . Oh , this isn 't me ! Well , whoever you are , you 're fired . GARY : Going on a road trip ? - Come on , Chett , talk to me . - I 'm lonely . You don 't exist . You 're just some freak figment of my imagination brought on by all this pressure I 'm under . " Get a job , get a life . " Is it any wonder I 've snapped ? You hated that job . I did you a favor . Yeah . You 're probably right . Sooner or later I would have gotten fired on my own . - I 'm no good . I 'm a loser . - You 're pathetic . Yeah . That too . So ... you just going to leave home ? I have no choice . It 's either leave or be thrown out . Okay , it worked . I 've suspended Chett 's conscious mind . We should be able to speak to Gary now . Gary ? Can you hear me ? Gary ? ! Whoa . I 'm stuck in his head , not deaf . We fixed the dream chair . We should be able to get you out now . No . Not yet . - What ? - I 'm not ready . What are you doing , looking for shrapnel ? Gary , you have to come out . If you stay much longer you 'll become part of Chett 's brain- - permanently . Why didn 't you say something earlier ? If I told you every time your lives were in danger - we 'd never get out . - I just need a few more minutes . There 's something I got to do for Chett . Hurry . You don 't have much time . Chett . We need to talk . I 'm not talking to you . Good . Then shut up and listen . You can 't leave . Your dad doesn 't care than you lost your job . He just wants to see you do something . Like what ? Be a busboy ? Nah . Dad 's right . I 'm a waste case . Talking to a toaster . Chett ? Why aren 't you at work ? I got fired . Guess I 'm not cut out to steam milk . Thought we had an agreement , Chett . Do you have anything to say to me ? Yeah . I 'll send you a check for the wheat thins . Let ... me ... go . It 's a test , man . He just wants to know you have to plan . You know- - goals , ambitions . Son , is there ... something else you want to say ? - No . - Get back there . Maybe . Got a plan ? - He 's never go for it anyway . - Just give it a chance . Dad , I don 't want to work in a coffeehouse . All right , great . What do you propose to do with your life ? Well , back in the corps I scored perfect on infiltration and annihilation and I 've been thinking . There 's this group in Bolivia called the america force . It hunts down troublemakers and neutralizes them . It 's fully funded by the C.I.A. they 've got really cool uniforms and a full dental plan . - I want to join up . - Bolivia ? They only ask for a 12-year commitment . But there 's more . After you 've done your time there 's a career placement program . Most wind up in the U.S. postal service . Great . B-b-but ... there may be other options that you can explore but you need to take you time . Uh , why rush into things ? Bolivia will always be there . Then ... I can stay ? As long as I know you 're exploring your options . [ Nervous Chuckle ] You can let go now , Chett . Uh ... no , I can 't . All right , operation resuce Gary is underway . This time , I 'm coming back with my best friend or I 'm not coming back at all . Gary , you made it . Where 's Wyatt ? Hey , the chair only seat four . [ Giggling ] Captioned by Grantman Brown

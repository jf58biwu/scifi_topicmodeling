 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ music playing ] [ laughs ] Animals around here are spooked . That 's why we didn 't bag anything . You 're not gonna tell me that you believe those stories , are you ? Stories about that thing ? You bet I do . Do you ? Nope , and I especially don 't believe in using some non-existent monster as an excuse for not being able to track a grizzly in a 7-11 . Oh , my God . I 'm gonna hit it . Nobody will believe us if we don 't get it . No ! No , you 're crazy ! No ! - Mr. Jackson . - Mr. Kent . What have you got there ? For me ? UFOs on the White House lawn ? Bigfoot in Bloomingdale 's ? No , sir . It 's the blood alcohol report on those two hunters that saw the creature . Allegedly saw . Always remember that word , Kent . Allegedly . Oh , boy . Sir , what 's wrong ? Kent , I want to tell you something . Don 't ever drink and drive . No , sir , I wouldn 't . Nope , I guess you wouldn 't . I forgot who I was talking to . Now wonder they wrecked their truck . Both of them came in over 3.0 . I 'm surprised the driver didn 't tell paramedics that he 'd seen Superboy arm wrestling the Loch Ness Monster . That 'd be impossible . Really ? Yes , sir , you see , the Loch Ness Monster doesn 't have arms . Allegedly . If I had known we were dealing with drunks , I wouldn 't have bothered sending Matt out to investigate . But it 's been a couple of days . Stop worrying . Matt 's a pro . Besides , he 's got a gun . He knows how to use it . Clark , did he say gun ? Hi , Lana . Are we still going to lunch today ? Yeah , sure , what did he say about a gun ? It 's just for protection ? And who 's gonna protect the creature ? The creature ? Come here . I 've got a record of every sighting of the creature in this file . And you know what ? It never hurt anybody . Not even those two drunks . One of them actually admitted they tried to run it over . Just because it hasn 't hurt anyone yet , doesn 't mean it never will . Clark ! It 's the last of its kind . It 's trying to exist in a world humans are destroying . Think how lonely it must be . I know where you 're going with this , and you shouldn 't . It could be dangerous . Leave it to Matt . Promise me . Promise me . [ loud rumbling ] Excuse me , bartender . A red-headed girl I was supposed to meet here . I 'm late . Nah . Hasn 't been in . Maybe she found something else better to do . And I bet I know what it was . Man or beast , nothing can stand up to an AK-47 . Yeah , but nobody knows what the hell this thing is . Yeah , and how you gonna find it out there ? I was in ' Nam , remember ? So are you with me ? This Sunday 's good for me . I was thinking about now . Well ? Excuse me . Did I hear you say you 're going to look for that creature ? Yeah , we 're going . You want to come ? No , I don 't wanna to go . None of us should . It 's already being investigated . We shouldn 't go ? It could be dangerous . Sure am glad there weren 't any like you with me in ' Nam . Come on , let 's go . Just a broken branch , right ? That 's what my point man in ' Nam said just before ... [ rustling ] He disappeared . Maybe that kid at the restaurant was ... No way . I don 't like this . What are you afraid of ? It 's just a little breeze . That thing 's gotta be in those bushes over there . [ shouting ] [ shouts ] Clark ! What are you doing here ? You promised . - Well , you came out here . - Yeah , but I was ... Never mind that . Look at this place . It 's his lair . It 's where he lives . - Creature ? - Yeah . Who lives in a lair this big ? And look at all this stuff . He has tools and ... A photograph . I couldn 't figure that one out , either , but I 'm going to . Shh . Stay here . The creature 's out here . I want to see him , too . Who are you ? What do you want ? You better tell us who you are . Shut up . You really shouldn 't talk to her like that . Oh , really ? What are you gonna do about it ? Nobody 's gonna do anything , Ben . I 'm Pat Kenderson . My company owns this place . Look , I 'm sorry for the rough treatment . Everyone 's a little on edge thanks to this damn thing running around out there . You are ? - Clark Kent . - Lana Lang . You believe in the creature ? You bet I do . I can 't afford not to . This plant provides power to over 400,000 homes . Last thing I need are disruptions on my land . Now that 's why I 've hired these fellas . So they can get the thing . To kill it ? If that 's what it takes . But what about his scientific value ? To me , it 's just an animal . But what if you give us a chance to find it before it ... No , not on my land . I know you two are a little curious , but you 're also trespassing , and I am a very busy man . You know , you are the most insensitive person I have ... Lana , you know , he is right . We don 't belong here . I 'd listen to him . Oh , a friend of ours was out here . Matt Ritter . I was wondering if any of your men ran into him . Yeah , they did . He said that he couldn 't find anything around the accident site so he was gonna move north for a few days . They also said that he looked like knew what he was doing . Unlike you and your little girlfriend . This time no interruptions . This is irradiated water from the reactor 's cooling system . Now do you know what this can do to you ? Hmm , to your skin ? Your internal organs ? Your children ? If you should ever have any . Good . Now how much do you know about this place ? Everything . How did you find out ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . Just heard Group B 's spotted Superboy . Superboy ? Yeah , he was flying over the forest . Let him come . I 'll have a little surprise for him . I also have a little surprise for you . [ shouts ] Always buy bottled . The tap water around here is almost as bad as the irradiated stuff . [ shouts ] We 're wasting our time . We should be out there . Lana , we promised . Now you 're being honest . I noticed you didn 't tell Kenderson about the lair , either . He never asked . Mr. Kent . Clark . This is Lana Lang . Have a seat , please . How did you find me ? The name of the photographer was on the back of the photograph we found . He gave us your number . Lana . Here 's the picture . It 's mine . Where did you find it ? It was in the forest . Any idea how it might have gotten there ? Two years ago somebody broke into the house . They stole this . Should we talk to Mr. Carter ? He died two years ago . If you 're waiting for Superboy to come and save you , forget it . He 's not gonna get within 10 feet of you . Now are you going to tell me what I want to know ? [ shouts ] Sorry , couldn 't really hear you . [ screams ] Now I can hear you . Why don 't you take a break ? Let 's go eat . I can 't . I 'm still going through the insurance company 's files . You tapped into somebody else 's files ? You know , maybe I 've been wrong about you all these years . I figure if I wanna go to Metropolis and be a reporter one day , I have to take the initiative . Besides , I 'm not doing any harm . Nah , I wasn 't wrong . So what did you get ? Well , I found out that Michael Carter had a $ 100,000 life insurance policy , but his wife never collected . On $ 100,000 ? Why wouldn 't she ? Maybe ' cause there 's no certificate for Michael Carter . He 's not dead . I don 't know , but I found out one other thing . He used to work at the Lakeside nuclear power facility . What are you getting at ? I wish I could be sure . Hey , we got a problem . What 's the matter , Augie ? This radiation badge I had on my desk has turned pink . It 's probably just worn out , that 's all . I 'm not taking any chances . The source has to be around here somewhere . [ clicking ] [ faster clicking ] That 's my hiking stuff . It 's in the canteen . I filled it with water from the river . I almost drank it . [ coughs ] You 're Michael Carter , aren 't you ? How did you know ? It all adds up . Working at the plant . The fake death , the photo . - You stole the picture ? - A friend did . Your wife has it now . Did you know she 's telling people you 're dead ? I might as well be . How can I go back to her like this ? What is this ? Some kind of radiation poisoning ? I could get you to a doctor . It 's no use . I went to one when it started . It 's radiation poisoning . But it 's also justice . Justice . I was working at Lakeside disposing of irradiated water . Kenderson was cutting all kinds of corners trying to save money . Told us to use the river . I didn 't go along . Not at first . But he told me I 'd lose my job if I didn 't . Is that how you were contaminated ? Contaminated ? Nice word . I 'm a monster . Why don 't you stop Kenderson once and for all ? You 're the only one that can link him to the dumping . I 'll take you to the police . No ! They can 't see me . I 'm a monster . - You 'll be a hero . - No ! [ gunshot ] [ groans ] - I 'll get you to the hospital . - No , no . No hospital . Why don 't you understand ? The other one did . Other one ? Yesterday . He wasn 't scared of me . I told him everything . Was his name Matt ? Uh-huh . He said he 'd talk to Kenderson . Then he went to the power plant . Kenderson lied to us . That 's what he does best . Go help your friend . I will , but first I 'm getting you to the hospital . It 's no use , though . Just let me die in peace . You wanna see a monster ? I 'll show you what they really look like . Where 's Matt Ritter ? He 's in the storeroom . I 'll be back for you . Don 't bet on it . - You all right ? - Yeah . But how we gonna get out of this place ? [ siren wails ] Get this man some help , please . Superboy , did you see the creature ? There was no creature , Lana . Not really . [ music playing ]

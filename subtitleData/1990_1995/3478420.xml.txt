 [ Devon Narrating ] I remember the history lessons Yale taught me as a child . How when the pioneers headed out across the American West 500 years ago , they encountered many dangers . Indian attacks , buffalo stampedes , yellow fever . All right , everybody . Let 's stop for recharging . Twenty minutes , then we go again . Morgan , honey , where you goin ' ? Nowhere . I 've just got some important business to attend to . You watch it , Martin . I 'm sorry . I was - [ Zipper Unzips ] [ Zipper Zips ] [ Whispers ] Bess . I saw it again . Morgan ? What ? It 's a Grendler . Third one today . [ Panting ] Right there in those bushes . Practically drooled on me . Morgan , honey . I don 't see it . [ Panting ] I don 't care . I saw a Grendler , Bess . The thing is following me . I 'm not imploding . Honey , it 's just the heat . Don 't tell me it 's the heat . I know what I saw . [ Devon ] On this planet , we are a new generation of pioneers , moving westward as fast as we can , trying to outrun our own dangers . I like to think danger 's less likely to hit a moving target . And while I push us foard , I can 't help thinking of the one danger we can 't outrun . What you thinking about , Dad ? Nothin ' . [ Devon ] The danger within . True ! Where are you , girl ? True ! Get into the pod . Hey . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Don 't you leave ! Hey ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Don 't leave . ! There 's people here . ! Hey . ! [ Female Computer Voice ] Pod is away . [ Chattering ] [ Devon Narrating ] Three weeks ago , our spaceship was dragged ... kicking and screaming into this planet 's atmosphere . The crash was horrible . I think he 's afraid of you . He should be . [ Devon ] And no one seems able to shake it from their memory . What the hell 's going on ? Cargo pods won 't release . ! They 're dragging us down right now . ! Come on . Release it . [ Female Computer Voice ] Proceed to evacuation . [ Devon ] The long hot days with nothing but ourjourney ... are allowing blame to fester like bacteria spreading through the group . I hope you 're better at checking the sand rail than you were with the cargo pod . Shut up , Solace . Are you sure you checked the air locks ? There must have been a switch somewhere . Yeah . I checked all the switches . Now get out of my face . - [ Alonzo ] Don 't touch me . - Get off his back , Solace . It 's not like he was the pilot . And what is that supposed to mean ? [ All Yelling ] Don 't touch me ! Hey ! Hey , Alonzo . Danziger , stop it . Stop . This has got to stop . No more finger-pointing about the crash . I will not have us tear each other apart over something that 's behind us . The crash was an accident . It happened . I am as unhappy and angry as the rest of you , but there is nothing we can do about it . It is behind us . How do you know it was an accident , Devon ? How do you know ? All right . I don 't know that for sure . Yale . Your eye . It digitally records every experience , right ? Yes , Devon , but I - So it recorded the crash . But it would only be from his point of view . Julia , right now that may be all we have . Yale , go back in there , review your digitized recordings . Maybe you can prove to everyone that it was an accident ... and that there was nothing anyone could have done to change it . Please . Give us a full accounting of everything you perceived to have happened . [ Clears Throat ] With all due respect , how do we know the cyborg isn 't gonna lie to us ? I - I mean , he does work for you , after all . [ Yale ] That is not my way , Mr. Martin . I give you my word . - [ True Screams ] - True ! [ True ] I found something . ! Hurry . ! [ Danziger ] Come on . True ? Sweetheart , what is it ? Look ! It 's a grave . They 're one of us . [ Sighs ] It 's ours . It 's Eden Project . It 's the other evac pod - the third one . Must have landed . They made it . Not all of them . Well , hey , come on . There 's only one grave . There must have been 1 5 or 20 people on that pod . Somebody must have dug the grave . This is good news . Yeah , but where is the pod ? We don 't know . But let 's get looking . We 'll camp here tonight . Judging by the soil , the grave wasn 't dug long ago . All right . Then we 'll have three search parties fanning out east , north and south . Let 's fire our flares , let ' em know we 're here . God . My gear . It keeps fritzing out . [ Walman ] Foolproof method . [ Shouting ] Eden Project ! Anybody out there ? This is hopeless . It 's like looking for a microchip on the Internet . I mean , the likelihood that we 're actually gonna find anything - [ Grendler Grunts ] Oh , no . Morgan . Morgan . Oh ! Morgan , what is it ? I got him , Bess . The Grendler . The one that 's been following me . I killed him . I protected us , Bess . What the - Oh , my God . Base camp . Base camp , please come in . [ People Yelling ] [ Beeping ] [ Alonzo ] Devon , where are you ? They found another grave . It 's Morgan , Bess and Walman . Get everyone back here now . It 's too hostile an environment . There could be penal colonists , and I don 't know what else . Now . All right . Danziger , Baines , come in . Another grave was found . Now Devon wants everyone back at camp now . [ Baines ] What are you talking about ? It 's not even dark yet . [ Danziger ] What 's up ? Well , they want us to come back . That would be premature . Check it out . There . Hallelujah . [ Alonzo ] All search parties , evac pod spotted 1 09 west , 23 1 north . Dune-rail proceeding immediately . Devon . Make it fast , Yale . It 's not what you wanted to hear . What are you talking about ? I found something in my mind 's eye . I don 't know who did it , but I don 't think the crash was an accident . It was sabotage . Sabotage ? And the saboteur could still be with us . Baines . Baines , wait up ! [ Groans ] Oh , my God . Baines ! Be careful . ! - [ Woman Groans ] - Back away from the door . Now ! Away . Firestein ? Wentworth ? Danziger ? Is it really you ? Yeah ! Get away . We 're dyin ' . Contagious . Danziger ? Danziger ! [ Danziger ] Get back . Don 't come any closer . Don 't come down here . No . I 'm coming . Danziger , what are you doing ? It 's bad , Adair . It 's really bad . What is that ? Crew member ? [ Danziger ] Yeah . And two more in the pod . Friends of mine from the ops crew . Dead ? No . Not yet . But they 're sick . That body down there is in some state of decomposing . We were all over it . I don 't think you should come down here yet . We have no idea how contagious this is . We 'll need some gear , and send Zero down with it . It 's okay . I won 't be infected . Thank you . Hey . Cavalry 's here . Everything 's gonna be okay , friends . We got a doctor . Zero 's gonna take your vitals . Adair , we 're all hooked up . Okay . We 're conferencing . Wentworth , Firestein , you there ? Wish we could come out and greet you guys proper . Our eyes really can 't take the daylight anymore . [ Devon ] Wentworth , this is Devon Adair . How you doing , ma 'am ? Don 't have to ma 'am her , Wentworth . We don 't work for her anymore . The other people in the pod , do they have this disease ? - Les . - [ Danziger On Headset ] What about the others , Les ? Well , we all made it , but it was a nightmare . We landed safe , but nobody could agree on anything . We splintered up into three or four different groups . Each took our share of supplies and got walking ' . Then we started gettin ' sick . Alex first . You know her history , John . Oh , yeah . Still looking for sick bay , Wentworth ? You always did have that weak constitution , girl . I can still drink you under the table , John . [ Danziger Laughs ] [ Firestein On Headset ] Alex 's body kept trying to fight whatever this virus is off . The others weren 't so lucky . We started burying them about 1 0 days ago . Do you have any idea where you caught it or how it 's spread ? I don 't know . Could have been anywhere . We were all drinking ' from the same canteens , all using the same latrines . Hey , John . Ferrying those soldiers down to Earth . We were playing poker . What was that guy 's name ? I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . Perry . Perry . Remember Perry , the guy sitting next to you with the suspenders ? He lost 7 5 units that night . You broke even when you pulled that jack . You had such a baby face then . - Danziger , what 's going on ? - I don 't know . Alex . - Les , what 's going on ? - It 's this disease , John . All of a sudden you get these flashes around your eyes , and the oldest memories start coming back , clear as day , like you were right there . They all just start coming back . [ Wentworth Groaning ] Then the pain . You never felt anything so horrible . Hang on . We 're gonna do something . - [ Danziger ] Just hang in there . We 're here now . You 're not alone anymore . - [ Headset Beeps ] Solace . ! Forget it . - Abort now ! Abort ! - [ Alarm Beeping ] What are you trying to do , Yale ? Prove to everyone else that I 'm a lousy pilot ? No . I 'm just trying to find out what happened before the crash . Were you the first out of cold sleep ? [ Alonzo ] Of course not . Missions that long , the pilot doesn 't get up first . The medical officer does . So why don 't you go ask her ? [ Yale ] I will , Alonzo . Humor me . I 'm just trying to fill in the missing pieces . Now , was there anyone else with you in the cockpit those first few minutes ? [ Alonzo ] You 're asking me about the first minutes after 22 light-years of cold sleep . I don 't remember . It 's biologically impossible . Synapses haven 't kicked in yet . Not for the first few minutes . Trust me . Now , no one remembers , Yale . [ Yale ] All right . Let me ask you another question . Did you have any verbal communications with - Boy , oh , boy , oh , boy . Who knows what that sanctimonious cyborg has lodged in his memory banks ? [ Growling ] Please . Stop . Cease and desist . I beg you . I can 't take running into you like this . What do you want ? No . I 'm warning you . Don 't touch me . Don 't touch me . Leave me alone . Don 't touch me . No . Don 't touch me . Morgan . Morgan . [ Panting ] Morgan , honey , who are you talking to ? [ Morgan ] The Grendler . The-The one that 's been haunting me . Bess , he was right here . I swear . He was right here . Morgan , what is going on ? You-You have been acting so strange lately . [ Sighs , Whimpers ] [ Mumbling ] I 'm sorry , Morgan . I can 't understand you . I did it . I did it . I did it . What did you do ? I took the pod . The emergency pod when the ship was crashing - I took it . It wasn 't wind shear like I said . It was just me . I took the pod . I just let us go . And I didn 't wait for anybody . Do I look stupid , Morgan Martin ? No . You look good . I know the man I married , and I pretty much assumed that 's what happened with the pod . You did ? Yeah . Oh . Oh , Bess , Yale 's gonna find out , and they 're gonna string me up . No . They 're gonna lynch me . No , that is not gonna happen ... because you are gonna make a clean breast of it . You 're gonna tell all those good people exactly what you did . I am ? Confession washes the soul , Morgan . Well , I confessed to you . My soul feels pretty clean . Oh . [ Danziger ] Easy . [ Devon ] Danziger and Baines had to be kept quarantined . If they caught the disease from the corpse , we could not risk infecting the larger group . Danziger , you get the food okay ? Yeah . Thanks . Though I gotta tell you , spirulina is not really my idea of a last meal . Please don 't . It 's not funny . Listen , uh , I think I got this thing . I lost some feeling in my hand about an hour or so ago . I 'm already feeling a little sensitive to light . It 's beginning . - Baines too ? - Yeah . Look , Julia is on the road to finding something , and I bet tomorrow she 's going to be down there with a cure ... for whatever this godforsaken thing is , and we will all be able to move on . You make sure True gets to bed on time tonight . Okay , Adair ? She 's a real monster if she doesn 't get her sleep . I 'll tuck her in myself . Thanks . [ Beeps ] [ Bess ] Yes , he took it . It was a turbulent situation . And he was frightened , and he lost his head , but I know this man better than the rest of you . And deep down - very deep down - he is a most generous person . And he 's very sorry . And that 's what he wanted to say . Then why doesn 't he say it instead ofhiding behind his wife ? [ Magus ] Yeah . Selfish coward . - Did you cause the crash too ? - I 'm still searching my memory . No , you 're not . You 're making all of us search our memory . Every memory I get makes me think I got the disease . I say the best thing to do is to pack up and get out ofhere . What about Danziger and Baines ? Do they even have the disease ? - We don 't know yet . - There 's gotta be something in the air here that 's causing this thing . [ Walman ] Why should we stick around ? For us all to die from it ? We are gonna stick around because Danziger and Baines are part of our group . I 'm not going anywhere . Now , Julia 's doing an autopsy right now , trying to figure out how to treat this disease . We arrived here as a group , and we are going to fight this thing as a group . Dad ? Dad , you awake ? True ? True , you get back . You hear me ? [ Panting ] Don 't come any closer . You stay right where you are . [ Panting ] You know I love you , don 't you ? Are we all gonna die ? No , baby . No way . Not if I have anything to say about it . But you have to trust me now . Go back to camp , okay ? Well , what about Wentworth and Firestein ? They gonna die ? We 've known ' em a long time , haven 't we ? You were 1 1 months old , and Wentworth would come over to our little unit , dress you up and teach you those funny songs . You know , the first steps you ever took were into her arms . You were wearing the , uh - uh , those yellow overalls with the ducks on them . Those were your favorite . Remember ? You were somethin ' then . You sure remember that good , Dad . Yeah . I 'll see you tomorrow , kid . Okay ? You go back and sleep tight . Sweet dreams . I love you . Bye . Rough night ? Oh . Cutting into corpses and doing autopsies - Any success ? Did you isolate what it is these people have ? Isolated , yes . Recognize it , I - Yale , this planet - I mean , this virus resembles no other virus I 've ever seen . Hanta , filo , zygotic . I - It goes straight for the brain cells , short-circuiting all nerve endings , as if by design . Like a computer virus . And I don 't think I can stop it . Now Danziger has it and Baines , and I just - I don 't know if I 'm up to it . [ Baines ] It 's making me crazy . I can 't take this sitting here waiting to die . Easy , Baines . Easy . Try to keep a lid on that kind of thinking . No . He should say it . He 's afraid . There 's no reason for him to not say it . Then why aren 't you saying it ? Aren 't you afraid ? Wentworth doesn 't get afraid . Does she , Les ? [ All Chuckling ] That time our troop freighter was going down over the Arctic - you remember that ? Oh , I practically lost it . You just sat there and held my hand through the whole thing . - Never flinched . - I expected to die too many times , I guess . Alex has a history of malignancies . Tissue growth in her cranium . Brain tumors . You can say it , boys . I 've been under the laser so many times my medical chip looks like an encyclopedia disk . That 's why the army dumped me . Your medical chip ? Like a history chip ? Still got that ? Yeah . [ Danziger ] Here . Let 's see . Easy , Danziger . God . There 's - I doubt if there are any clues on that thing . [ Firestein ] And brain tumors aren 't contagious . Well , let 's let the doctor be thejudge of that . Zero , get down here and make a pickup . Emergency . Come on , Bess . ! Come on . ! [ Groans ] [ Yells ] We 're not gonna die on this thing , Bess . We 're not dying on this thing . No , Morgan ! No ! Okay , okay . I took the pod . I didn 't cause the crash . [ Exhales ] I didn 't cause the crash . [ Gasps ] My God . Not you again ! [ Morgan Yelling ] [ Yelling Continues ] Please get out . I am working . I can 't get it off . It 's burning . - Hey . ! What ? - Just get it off . - What is your problem ? - It 's burning my skin . ! Freeze ! I am working here . I haven 't slept , and there are samples everywhere . What the hell are you screaming about ? Grendler saliva . You know , the creature that 's been following me . Okay . I - I can 't get it off . It won 't come off . Okay . It 's burning away at my skin . It 's eating my flesh . Morgan . Morgan . It 's not eating away at anything . You 're fine . Fine ? You 're fine . Now , there 's a disinfectant bath out back . Why don 't you go and stick your hands in it ? And your head while you 're at it . - Thank you . Thank you . - [ Beep ] Disinfectant bath . Yes . I - I 'll go wash now . [ Beeping ] Oh , no . What has he done ? [ Groans ] [ Morgan ] I 'm not the saboteur , Yale . And I would really like to help you find out who did it , but all I see are Grendlers . Excuse me ? Grendlers . One in particular . He 's everywhere . I 'm seeing him , like , 1 0 times a day now . And he 's somehow found his way into my mind . You don 't think that that 's a symptom of the disease , do you ? I really don 't know , Morgan . It 's a mysterious ailment . My God . Can 't you be a little more comforting ? I 'm sorry . No . I suppose I can say you 're only suffering from ... extreme guilt-induced paranoia . But then again , I 'm not a doctor , am I ? [ Julia ] Devon , Yale , get in here . What is it ? Saliva . I - I think the answer 's saliva . And Grendlers secrete it from every orifice . Saliva is the cause of the illness ? No , no . Not the cause . The cure . I haven 't yet determined what the cause is . But Grendler salivary glands could be the greatest pharmaceutical factory in the universe . I have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . Okay . Um , Morgan came in here 1 5 minutes ago ... and sprayed Grendler saliva all over everything and coated some of my samples . I ran some tests . The virus on this slide was completely neutralized . All cell reproduction came to a halt when it came in contact with the Grendler saliva . Okay . Okay , we don 't have a luxury of time here . Let 's try it out . I don 't - I don 't think I have enough of it . I think if I had some more fresh saliva that I could create an antiviral serum and buy us some time . - Okay . How do we find ourselves a Grendler ? - [ Tent Flap Rustling ] I , uh - [ Clears Throat ] I think I might be your man . [ Equipment Beeping ] [ Wentworth ] You and me , Les . The first time we met at a little restaurant , you reached across the table and wiped my mouth . You didn 't even know me . And we-we were so young . And you - [ Groaning ] It hurts . [ Firestein ] It 's okay , Al . Happy memories don 't hurt as bad , do they ? Oh , God , I hate you gotta see me like this . [ Beep ] [ Julia ] Danziger . Danziger , are you in there ? John ? Yeah . I 've come up with something to fight the virus . Just hold on . Tell your friends I 'm working as fast as I can . Danziger , are you there ? Uh , I 'll call you back . John , tell her to hold on.John ? Hey . Baines , you wanna - Yeah . Sure thing , man . I 'll be waiting outside . [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Hey . You remember the time we snuck out of basics and closed down that dance hall ? You shoved your hand through that window . Back then we thought there was nothing we couldn 't do . You remember ? Yeah . Those were wilder days . There was this girl . Um , Corrine . Oh , she broke your heart . - All that strawberry hair . - [ Danziger Chuckles ] I told you she was bad news , didn 't I ? Yeah , you did , Al . I should 've listened to ya . - You always had that inside line on my best interests . - Damn straight . Yeah . Les . Les . Right here , Al . Right here . [ Exhales Deeply ] You always took good care of me . [ Sighs ] Even when I was in the hospital , you always took good care . That 's why I was put here , baby - to be your angel . Are you my angel , sweetie ? That 's what I am . I 'm watching over you . You are watching over me , aren 't you ? Since the first time we met ... I 've had an angel . [ Groans ] You 're all comin ' back . [ Sighs ] The rhymes we used to make up and our ... wedding . I mean , those funny voices you - Oh . We made so many promises . We - To each other . We-We were gonna be sailors . [ Exhales ] Forgive me , Les . It 's my fault . I never should have dragged you into this mission . I was head of ops . I couldn 't ... release that cargo pod . It 's my fault . No , it wasn 't , John . I know you didn 't have anything to do with the crash . It was me . I sabotaged the ship . [ Bird Calls ] [ Morgan ] Grendler . Grendler ? Grendler . If you 're out there , uh , I 'm sorry I , you know , shot at you the other day . I 'm - I 'm kind of prone to irrational behavior . Like taking that emergency pod . I wouldn 't do that again . I - I 'm learning , you know . I realize that 's easy to say now , but I - [ Grunts ] Hi . Oh , look . I know this isn 't very polite , but , um , if you wouldn 't mind just ... slobbering into this a little bit ? Okay . Okay . Um , look . Look , I have to do this , and ... I don 't expect something for nothing , so - Here . You can have whatever you want . Yeah . See , look . Lumalight , huh ? And , uh-Anything . Really . Vera-frames , huh ? [ Grunting ] Oh . Oh , God . Don 't kill me . Don 't kill me . Don 't kill me . Don 't kill me . Don 't kill me . Don 't kill me . [ Grunting ] [ Whimpers ] Oh . That 's it ? The shirt off my back ? Hey , you got it . What 's mine is yours . If your drool is mine . Oh . Sure . There you go . [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] [ All Yelling ] [ Female Computer Voice , Indistinct ] Wentworth ! Wrong way . Firestein . That pod 's taken . Follow me . [ All Shout ] [ Julia On Headset ] Danziger . Come in . [ Groans ] John , are you there ? [ Beeps ] Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . What 's up ? I did a neurographic scan on Wentworth ... during her autopsy to see if her illness was in any way related to her history of tissue growth in her cerebrum . Yeah ? So ? Show him what you found . - What 's that ? - It 's a neuro-motivation chip . Tell him how you know that , Yale . I know because the government implanted one in me too . Les ! Les , I need to talk . [ Grunting ] Les . [ Panting ] Oh , no . Les ! Les . Hey , Les ! Les . Oh . Alex always wanted to be a sailor . Just like in them old stories . Yeah . I remember the day we found this river . [ Exhales ] She was so happy . Never seen her smile like that before . Les . I need you to tell me what happened on that ship . You don 't want to know . Yes , I do . I want you to tell me how you caused that crash . - You want to know what I did ? - Yeah . Fine . I woke from cold sleep . It was quiet . It was those first dead minutes . Hallways were empty . I went to parafuse box L 1 3 7 . Knew that system inside and out . Me and Alex used to maintain L 1 3 7 release catalysts on the troop freighters . Used my ops code to open it . Melted out all the connective plugs . No matter what you did , there 's no way that cargo pod was gonna disengage . I did it . You happy now ? Does that satisfy you , John ? No , man . Because I know it was her . No . You 're wrong . I did it . It wasn 't her fault , Les . The space station technocrats put a chip in her head ... during one ofher operations . The one right after shejoined the Eden crew . That organic chip interacted with the planet somehow ... and leaked into her brain . That was the virus . It mutated and spread through the air to all of us . Space station ? Yeah . Put a chip - You saw her do it , didn 't ya ? [ Mouths Word ] Alex was lucky . She never knew . Why are you up here , Al ? I thought we were gonna clean off . I don 't know . Let 's go , honey . [ Firestein ] The disease only unlocked old memories in her . I had to unlock one that was only three weeks old . A memory I didn 't even know I had . When did you remember ? Four days back . Before you found us . I - I didn 't know why she did it , and I couldn 't ask her . [ Beep ] [ Julia ] Danziger , where are you ? [ Sighs ] Right here . Right here , Julia . Where ? Is Firestein with you ? Yeah . He is . Well , Morgan actually came through . He lost all his clothes , but I 've got the saliva , and I 've actually fashioned something . Okay . We 're on our way . [ Beep ] Come on , buddy . Gotta get back to the pod . They 're gonna save us . [ Grunts ] You see her , John ? She 's here , John . You come for me , baby ? Yes , I 've come for you . I 'm your angel , Les . Hey , man . Come on , buddy . Hang in there . No . Come on . Help 's on the way . It 's okay , John . I 'll take care of it now . Come on , lover . We 're going to sail away . She 's here , John . And she looks so beautiful . I married the most beautiful woman in the universe . Yeah , you did , man . Yeah , you did . You tell her - Tell her that we forgive her . And you tell her that I love her . I know . She already knows . Good-bye . [ Danziger ] Bye . [ Devon Narrating ] We thought there was a saboteur in our midst , and we found her . But she was no spy . She was just a victim ofher own past . I wish Wentworth and Firestein would have gotten better , just like you . Yeah . Me too , sport . [ Devon ] It 's a funny thing about the past - the way it keeps chasing us , no matter how fast we try and run away . What ? You did good , Morgan . Well , that shirt had sentimental value , you know . And I don 't even want to mention the pants . [ Devon ] And now we put the nightmares of the past behind us , taking solace in the fact that it was not the planet that was making us sick , but the planet that healed us . Yes . With time the memories will fade away , but that doesn 't mean any of us will ever forget . [ Grunts ] [ Exhales Sharply ] [ Beep ] [ Beep ] Julia Heller , initial check-in . Code X0482 . I 've joined you on the planet . Monitoring Eden Project . [ Sighs ] And I know you planned the crash . [ Sighs ] [ Narrator ] Next on Earth 2 . [ Man ] Join me on virtual . I want to see you . [ Screaming ] My leg is killing me . Take it easy . Take it easy . Grendlers stole our reserve water . Apparently for the containers . They just dumped the water everywhere . I heard . Haven 't you ever kissed a guy before ? - [ Rumbling ] - Watch out ! John , are you okay ?

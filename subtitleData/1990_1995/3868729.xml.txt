 There he is . - It 's the man , right there . - Go . Have a little discussion , with you , my man ? Where you going , pencil neck ? You- - Yeah , it 's me . This thing must be stopped ! Let me have it . Right here , boss . It 's not too late . You can still come back . Let me have him . You fool , Segawa . Think you could get away with it ? These inhuman experiments must stop . Oh , no . - Teriyaki sauce ! - Yeah . Turn him into sushi . Your can is packed , tuna man . Ohhh ! Woo . What a waste of a good brain . Yeah ! Woo . Let 's go . That 's three . Want to try for four ? It was a lucky move . - Hello . - Hi . So ... you need a ride home tonight ? Okay . It 's better than the bus . Okay , today I 'm going to demonstrate a technique that 's called ilimi . This is an Aikido technique , and it means " entering throw . " So for example if your opponent comes at you with a kick and a punch , just use your chi power . " Chi " means the central energy of people and of the universe . Your chi must be in tune with the chi of the universe . May I help you ? - When you open your mind ... - I 'm looking for Mizky Segawa . That 's me . Dr. Tetsu Segawa 's daughter ? Is something wrong ? I think we should talk- - privately . Sure . ... neutralize his attack by entering diagonally , take his center and redirect his power back at him . I 'm Max Reed , CIA . Been investigating the Chronos Corporation where your father worked . I 've got some bad news for you . What ? Your father and I had a meeting tonight . He was delivering something he 'd gotten out of Chronos ' lab . He said it was important ... and dangerous . He never made it . They got to him first . I couldn 't quite make out what was going on . It was violent . - Woo . - Weird . Teriyaki sauce ! Let 's go ! We couldn 't get to him in time . Why the hell didn 't you wait ? Jesus . I 'm sorry ... your father 's dead . Okay , Ben , attack me . Sean , how about stepping forward and showing the class your version of the move I just demonstrated . Come on , let 's go . Greg , you attack Sean . Sean , you defend yourself and use the ilimi throw . Hajime ! Rule number one , pay attention . Okay everybody , let 's try it . You two , try it again . Sean ! - Hey , butthead , I wasn 't ready . - You should 've been . Hey , hey ! You guys , break it up . - Hey ! - Break it up . Hey , hey ! Hold it ! You two want to get personal ? Take it outside . - Get a wet towel for that . - Yeah , okay . I 'm sorry . Sean , you have to learn to control your temper , or nothing I 'm teaching you here is ever going to help you out there . Now cool out for a while . Ah . You have it ? Good , because ... I wouldn 't want ... a hair on your ... lovely head hurt . I recovered the Guyver myself . Of course you did . What is this , some sort of masochistic joke ? ! How did that get in there ? Sto- - I 'll get it back . I 'll get it back . You idiot . I 'll have you slap yourself into oblivion if you don 't find it . It is the only one in existence . You must find it . I 'll find it . I 'll get it . The decomposed body of Dr. Tetsu Segawa , a genetic scientist for the Chronos Corporation , was found earlier tonight here below the 7th Street Bridge . We contacted Chronos Corporation representatives , but they would not comment on why no reports were made ... He never harmed anybody in his whole life . My mother died when I was little , and as a kid , I worshipped my father . Who would do this to him ? I intend to find out . Who the hell did you bring in here this time , Reed ? So you 're still chasing Ninja Turtles , huh ? Hey , I 'm telling you , I saw them . And I 'm telling you , you 're going after the wrong people . You 're telling me they got friends in high places . I 'm telling you you got a bad attitude . And this is no longer departmental business . Hey . I 'm on my own time , all right ? Okay , Max , you want to chase monsters ? Go right ahead . Only thing I can offer you is enough rope to hang yourself . What 's this ? Wow . Man . You know , something terrible must have gone wrong for him to end up in a place like this . It took a lot of courage for him to contact me . I 'm not gonna let him down . Come on , I 'll take you home . You may be getting a visit from the police tomorrow . They 'll be asking a lot of questions . I 'm just sorry I don 't have more information for you . You 've been very kind . Yeah , well ... I 'm not sure I like leaving you here . Could be dangerous . Just what was my father mixed up in ? You know , I 'm not exactly sure . It was very strange . He was trying to bring me a mechanical device that Chronos had found . Something he called the " Guyver " ? The Guyver ? What 's that ? Apparently , it was some sort of space armor , I think . I mean , I don 't know , but your father described it as the most dangerous technology since the atom bomb . He was a research scientist . How could he get involved in something like that ? I don 't think the inventors of the atom bomb knew what they were getting into either . I do know that when your father knew what was at stake , he tried to get back into the lab , steal it , and bring it to me . Let me . You never know . It 's okay . It 's my place . Okay , go ahead , but be careful . Oh , I forgot . Are you all right ? Yes . Sean , I 'm sorry , I forgot about the ride . Uh ... Look , I 'm sorry , I didn 't realize that you had company . No , it 's not that . No , no it 's okay . I didn 't mean to disturb you . I just wanted to make sure that you were okay . I gotta go . That 's a lousy place for a mirror . Yo , checkout time . Come on , my man , check out time . - What ? - Get outta here . I thought checkout time was 11 : 00 . Hey . Hey ! Hey ! Yo , you 've got to learn how to recycle . Yeah , recycle this . Yo , mama , why you wanna be so crude ? You must think of me as one rude dude But you the one with the sugar and spice So why don 't you just act real nice ? Striker , get back to work . But we don 't even know what that Guyver thing looks like . You don 't need to know . Just bring me whatever you find ! Shit . Aw , great . What 's wrong , man ? The bike don 't wanna start ? Hey , man , watch out , I 'l help you with that . Come on , man , get away from my bike . Wow ! Cool , chili man , I 'm just trying to help you out . - Come on , man- - - I 'm telling you , get away from it , or I 'm gonna have to really hurt you . Ooh ... it 's Kung Fu Man . Hey ! Hey , guys , look , it 's Kung Fu Man . Ain 't no mats out here , homeboy . You know this fool ? Yeah , we threw down before . Look , I don 't want to hurt anybody , okay ? No , no , no , he 's just trying to fix his bike . That 's what I was telling him , man . Heh . Well , I could do that . Oops . It didn 't start . It must be busted or something . What do you think ? Hey , what do you think ? Get him ! Now , you got something to show , man ? Come on . You got something , man ? Come on . Show us what you got . Wow . Wait . Wait a minute . He doesn 't scare me . I 've seen him fight , then . Hit him ! Yeah ! Come on , man ! Where are you going ? Hold up , man ! Hold up , hold up ! That 's what you get for messing with us . Get up . Come on , man , what 's up with you ? Hey , you got the money ? Check it , I don 't even see nothing in there , man . - Watch out , he 's gonna get away . - Stay down . Hey . Don 't touch him , man . Don 't touch him . He 's sick or something . What the hell is that , man ? That ain 't right , man . That ain 't right . - Oh no . - Oh ! Wait , wait , wait . Wow , hold on , man . Wait , watch out . He 's gonna get him . Kick his ass , man . Get in there . Kick his ass . Get him . - Get him . - Go ahead , you . - Come on , man . - Come on . You 're dead , dude . - Get him . - Get him . Got him . Got him , man . Help ! I don 't got him , man . Get him , man . Get him . It 's all right , man . Watch out ! Watch out , man , I got something to cut you . - Come on . - Cut you . Oh . You asking for it now ! Oh , no . I 'm just playing you , man . Yeah , that 's it , I 'm just playing . Then let 's play . Okay , Mr. Robocop , you 're going down . I ain 't got no bullets . I 'm outta here , man . No , you 're going down . Hey , man . Just be cool ! Come on ! - What the ... ? - Be cool . You guys come in peace , right ? Oh my God . We 're friendly people , man . What happened to me ? I can 't get it off . No ! Yo , boss , we 're getting nothing , man . It ain 't here . You know what I 'm saying ? Junk . Nothing , but junk . He must 've pulled a switch . Brilliant . Do you realize what 's at stake ? The most lethal weapon ever conceived . A one-of-a-kind prototype lost for centuries , and all you have for me is " he pulled a switch . " His daughter was at the river channel . - His daughter ? - Last night . - Daughter ? - With two men . - They might be the ones- - - Bring her to me ! And anyone else connected . Perhaps she knows something . It 's obvious you don 't . Go , get her . Yes , sir ! Damn ! Oh , shit . Wow . Come on , you didn 't push hard enough . We didn 't even get near the head guy . They 're not a weapons manufacturer . Segawa is a pinhead scientist . - What is there to push ? - He discovered something . I think he was trying to bring it to me when they got to him . They said he didn 't steal anything and nothing 's missing . We need more than a midnight shadow to bother those kind of people . - Hey , we got a murder here ! - Max , we got a corpse that look 's like it 's a month old . At least the pieces that are left . I tell you one thing that I know for sure- - Chronos was not involved . Nice and neat , huh ? No fuss , no muss . Look , I think it 's better that way- - for all of us . Just one thing- - I mean , what the hell is a scientist doing in the middle of the night walking down a concrete riverbed in his lab coat , fishing ? Who knows ? Some people will do anything to land a fish . Even tell a fish story . Yeah , well it ain 't fish I smell , it 's a rat . Just cool it , Reed . It 's out of our hands . For all we know , it could be some sick random killing from last month 's caseloads . I mean , what are they looking for ? Where else are they gonna look ? Damn . You 're right . You just convinced me . Where the hell are you going ? To get enough rope to hang myself . I want him followed- - around the clock . Oh , hi . Hi . Come in . Sean , I have something to tell you about last night . All right , look- - no that was my fault . Last night , I mean . I just thought maybe ... Mizky , is something wrong ? My father was killed last night . Oh my God . I- - I 'm sorry . I had no idea . I know . It 's just that ... I don 't know ... I feel numb , or I could scream . I 'm so alone . I 'm glad you 're here . Ms. Jensen . I forgot . Perfect timing . Hi . Can I help ? Oh , no , I got it . I 'd just like to put it down . - Yeah , of course , come in . - Thanks . Hi , Sean . I didn 't realize I was interrupting anything , barging in like this . Oh , no . No , actually ... I was just leaving . I 'll just be a minute . Stay . No , really . I 'm out the door . Well , you don 't really need to go . She 'll just be a minute . Okay , what if I go get something to eat and bring it back , and we could just talk ? Okay . Hi . Excuse me . You know ... - this Guyver is- - - Shh ! This is the first quiet moment we 've had together . You know , you 're right ? There should be more quiet moments together . Yeah . In Brazil . Really ? ! Really ? ! Why not ? And then will you take me shopping ? - Sure , I 'll take you shopping . - Ohh ! - She wasn 't this heavy before . - My face is killing me . - Keep moving there . - Jesus . Mizky ! Oh my God . Mizky . Well , now that I 've captured the young lady , why don 't you do me a favor and run up to the apartment and get my hat , you captured lady ? If wasn 't for me , you 'd be on the floor , still going , " Aaah . " You go upstairs and get your own hat . I 'm not a male chauvinist . I didn 't want to knock the girl out again . You couldn 't knock her out ? I had to kill the other one myself . - I 'm not going to go get your hat . - Look , I need the hat . It 's like Kryptonite , I cannot functions- - Well , if you 're Superman , go and fly and get hat . Cut the chatter . Come on . This could be trouble . - This could be trouble . - What ? - Could be trouble . - Forget your trouble , man . There 's no trouble . Just be quiet , don 't say nothing , man . Be quiet . Gentleman . - Hey , what the hell 's going on ? - They got Mizky . - They killed Ms. Jensen ! - All right , get going . Go on ! - Get them up . - Come on . - Come on . - Get up . No transformations- - we can 't be seen . Snap out of it . Let 's go . Come on . All right , come on . Come on . I 'm coming . Come on . This way . Get over the wall . 17- - quiet ! Ah , screw it . - I got him ! - Striker . Geronimo ! Chill , mama , shh ! Cut that ! Be quiet ! My bo- - The boss is right there . Shh ! Hey , chill , cool ! Bruisin ' , killin ' , cruisin ' ! Shh ! - Hey , yo ... - Cut ! Yo , where the hell am I ? Hey , that is not your cue ! You stepped on my scream . - Huh ? - No , no , no , no . You 're not afraid of her , she is afraid of you . Come on . Look , you were great . You were wonderful darling , really . - No . Make-up , over here . - Idiot . Look . Look , look , look , look , look . - You 're the big boogedy monster . - Boogedy monster . All we want you to do is to jump over the wall ... Jump . - land down here , go , " I 'm gonna get you , I 'm gonna get you . " She can scream , she gets scared a lot . And that 's it . It 's that simple . - You missed a spot . - Get off me . Come on . The suit looks great . You look terrific , but I need you to be more- - more terrifying . You 're a monster . - Terrifying . - I need you to play this with- - with- - What ? What ? With truth . - Can you do that ? - Oh , right on . Yeah , yeah . We 've got to go . All right , back to one . We gotta get to the car chase before lunch . You can do it . Everybody , c 'mon. we 're sitting on a powder keg . We have got to move ! We have got to go , right now . Damn . We can 't go back . Come on . Come on . We got to find another way out of here . Damn . Why are they chasing us ? They want the Guyver . The what ? The Guyver . They killed my father and then Ms. Jensen for it . And they think that I have it . But I- - I think he was trying to give it to me at the river channel . No screw ups this time . Once we 're inside ... we can all have some fun . But I want that girl unharmed . What is a Guyver ? ! From what he told me , it 's some sort of defense shield or space armor . Something that could be dangerous if Chronos figured out how to activate it . Is that monster chasing us a Guyver ? . I don 't know what the hell that is , and I 'm not sure I want to find out . Oh my God , they 're coming ! Come on , get outta sight . Move it . Striker ! - Ramsey ! - Yes , boss . Find the girl . You , search downstairs . You got it , boss . Come on , let 's go shopping . You said Brazil . Come on . Olly Olly , Oksolivich ! Come out , come out , wherever you are . MC Striker is looking for you near and afar You 'll never , never have to hide anymore 'Cause you can come to Uncle MC Striker 's store We 're here , we 're there , we 're everywhere Come with us , you have no fear . Not here . Girl . They 're up there , I can smell it . What ? I don 't see nothing up here . I 'm telling you , they 're up there . Yo , come to Papa . Idiot . Get him . Get going ! Look out ! Come on ! Oooh ! Wow ! Sean ! - No ! - Gotcha ! Mizky ! You 're mine , sucka ! Uh-oh ! Striker . Striker ! Are you all right ? No problem , bro . I 'm fine . Whoa ... Oh , Striker , come on , it 's okay . Bring her down here . Go , go . Let 's hope we 're not too late . - Which way did they go ? - That way . Come on . Oh good . Look , the whole team 's here now . Sorry , we 're late . Sean ! Shut up ! Let her go ! Shut up ! Is that a request ? I know what you want . Shut up . The Guyver ? You have the Guyver ? Yeah , the Guyver , that 's what you want , right ? Yeah . Where is the Guyver ? What the hell 's he doing ? Watch out , I 'll take care of this thing . Come on . Look out ! Sean ! Oh ! Dissed , you homie . Don 't hurt him ! - He doesn 't know a thing . - Shut up ! Leave her alone ! I do know ! I am the Guyver ! The Guyver ? I said , " Let her go ! " Yo , I 'll deal with this . I 've been looking high , I 've been looking low For the Guyvin' jivin ' thing to show And now this punk 's become a hunk When all along he 's had the soul Well , let me just tell you one thang I 'm gonna boot that thing with the Guyver name I 'm going to make you crawl and gonna make you sing 'Cause I want that Guyvin ' jivin ' thing Boyee . Then come and get me . Holy shit ! Your move . Take him . Hey . Damn . I 'll kill you . Heh heh . Hey , watch it . Yo man , catch . Sorry . Striker ! You idiot ! Yo , man , I 'm just doing my job . Aw , shit . Take her . Kick his ass , boss . You don 't have to take that crap from him . Hurt him bad ! Ahh ... so that 's it , you do have a weakness . Ahh , it 's the ball . He 's dead meat . Come on , save a piece for me ! Tin man ! Oh my God . What have I done ? Yo , he done killed the wrong chick . No . Take him . No . Mizky . No ! No ! No-oo ! Mizky ! Mizky ! Pick him up . Pick him up ! Killed my woman , boy ! Mizky . What have I done ? - Where 's Sean ? - Shh . No-oo ! No , Sean ! No ! Shit ! That 's the Guyver ? Ha ! Nothing to it . Come here , my man . Max ! There , there , my dear ... it 's all right , I 'm your friend . Who are you ? Fulton Balcus . I 'm Chairman of the Board of the Chronos Corporation . I knew your father very well . - What ? - Brilliant scientist . You have my deepest sympathy , my dear . Oh my God . What about Sean ? And Max ? I 've gotta- - I 've gotta call the police . Oh , yes , yes , yes . Most regrettable , but it 's all been taken care of . That is not the important thing . The important thing is ... you friend found a most valuable item . I must find out how he managed to activate it . What ? The Guyver unit . Come with me . I want to show you a few things . Here we are . The growth corridor . What are they ? These are Zoanoids , genetically altered human beings . Huh ? You see , my dear , a long time ago , when the planet was barren ... the aliens descended upon the Earth and created Man . The aliens ? That 's right . Man was created as the ultimate organic weapon . And these are the next step in the evolutionary process . Warriors developed by the aliens from the human species . In times past , they were known as werewolves , minotaurs , vampires . Can you imagine these lovely creatures in the White House ? In every seat of power , in every country around the world ? Then what 's the Guyver ? The Guyver is an organic mechanism created by the aliens . It becomes a protective suit of armor . Only one Guyver has been found , but not one clue on how to activate that magnificent mechanism . I need your help . You saw it work . Tell me , how did your friend activate it ? No . I don 't know ! I have no idea what he did ! Grotesque little creatures , aren 't they ? You could easily become one of them . A rare specimen , indeed . With beauty like yours ... the results might not be so hideous . But I make no promises . Take a look around . This could be your new home . Let me go ! I don 't know anything ! Ah , I see you found our inner sanctum , hmm ? Come . Let me show you around . Hmm . No ! This is just- - Ah ... Dr. East . Let me out ! - Stop , get away from me ! - Ow ! There ! Sir ... Mr. Balcus , this is- - this is genetics . You know , not all mutations are created equal . Oh . New recruit ? Dr. East , Dr. Segawa 's daughter Mizky . Oh ... pleasure to meet you . Your father was ... a tragic loss . Dr. East is the head of our genetics research . He worked with your father very closely on the Guyver . In fact , he 's in charge of the current efforts right now- - the control metal . I 'm sorry , what ? Any progress ? The control- - ? Yes . Yes , let me show you . A most interesting sphere . It 's an elegant and inspired mechanism . It 's a real challenge to us all . Here it is . Sean . - Oh ! - Gordon has been following a most interesting development . A most interesting development , indeed . The crystalline structure of the control metal seems to be acting like a DNA model for the flesh . It 's like a molecular union , but with organic and inorganic compounds . In other words , we think it 's alive- - the whole thing . And we think it 's growing . Growing ? Growing what ? Well , it could be cloning itself ... - into a new Guyver unit . - New Guyver unit . How fortunate . Well ... maybe we don 't need your help after all . Except I hate to be rejected by a pretty face . It would be a lot easier if you simply told me . Perhaps Dr. East should start the process . What process ? Yes . Join your friend . Oh , no , Max ! Looks comfortable , doesn 't he ? Stop it ! Let him out of there ! Oh , no , he wouldn 't want to , not now . He enjoys it , believe me . It 's like being drugged . What are you doing to him ? - Dr. East , get ready for her . - Yes , sir . - Prepare the- - - No ! No ! Okay , I will tell you . I 'll tell you everything . Good . How does it work ? It was- - it was like- - like this . Ooh . Hey ! - What is she doing ? - What is she doing ? Don 't let her get away ! Get her ! Let 's do it . Let 's do it . No , not that ! Surround her . Hey ! There 's no place to run . We 're 300 feet down . Don 't be foolish . Stand back , or I 'll destroy it ! Stop ! - Don 't let her do it . - No , don 't . Put it down . There 's no need to get excited . Stay back ! No one here wants to hurt you . No . I want Max out of that thing . All right , my dear , that can be arranged . I 'm more than willing to cooperate . Come on . Screw this . I can get it . Hey ! Just get it ! Get it ! Ah , he swallowed the control metal . I was just doing my job . I was just doing my job . Spit it out of there . Spit it out ! - Spit it out ! - I can 't . I can 't get it out . Well then , cut him open ! Get it out ! Get it out ! It 's growing . It 's growing ! Sean , you 're alive ! I came back for you . I killed you once , and I 'll kill you again . You can 't kill me . I 've been rejected by death . Striker ! Sean , come on , we have to get Max out of there . Stand back ! Get him ! Stay back . - You must get him . - No , you get him . No , you go get him . - Get back . - No , you get him . Jeez , I thought you were dead . Never mind . Just find a way out of here . I 'll take care of this . - Be careful , Sean . - You too . Get away ! Come here . Oh my God . Let him go , you big ugly creep ! You 're mine . Get away . It 's going to be over in a minute . Come over here ! I 'll kill you now ! Come over here . You ! Wow ! Get going ! I 'll tear you apart . Come on , hurry up . This way . Guess not . Max . Nice work . I 'm just doing my job . You had your chance . Now it 's mine ... bonehead ! Are you okay ? Will you save it for later ? We still got to find a way out of here . Yeah , I know the way . Come on . What 's wrong ? My God . Max ? Oh , no ! Max . Sean , you 've got to help . But what can I do ? It 's too late for me , but you 've got to stop them . You 're ... our last chance . Don 't let them get away with thi- - Max . I won 't let you down , Max . Pitiful little creature . He wasn 't in the soup long enough . You . He would 've died anyway . Sean ! He 's the one ! He 's the one who murdered my father . Let her go ! What a splendid creation . You 're even more gifted , more powerful , than I ever dreamed possible . These grotesque mutants are mere child 's play compared to the Guyver . I must have it . Never . I would hate to see something ... unseemly happen to such a pretty little thing . Let her go . I 'm warning you- - Please , please no threats . I 'm a civilized man . A simple little transaction , a simple trade- - that 's all that 's needed . What do you mean ? I give you the girl , you give me the Guyver unit . It is no longer mine to give . I am the Guyver . Well , then ... I guess you lose . No , you 're the one who loses . I intend to stop your insane experiments on innocent people . Well , then do it . Come and get me ! Mizky . Sean . Do not rejoice prematurely , my friends . You have yet to see the true form of the Zoalord . And as the Guyver Zoalord , my powers will be magnified beyond belief . Holy shit . Mizky , get outta here . Now the Guyver is mine ! What 's this ? The suit ... it protected me . Sean . Are you all right ? Yes . Sean . Don 't be afraid , it 's just me . I know it 's you , Sean . I know . Wait . Well ... it 's all over . Come on ... let 's go home . Mm , mm , mm . No smoking ! I got a job for you . Ah ... " dy-no-mite . "

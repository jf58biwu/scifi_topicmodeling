 Oh , good . This stuff is great . Not here . In the car . No , I 've got ... That 's my medicine . You wouldn 't like me without my medicine . Aahhh . Unh . Umh . You scum . Don 't you know it 's wrong to take drugs ? What are you ? No . Give it ... No ! Unh . Hello . Byron ? You sound terrible . Are you all right ? I 've lost my serum . All of it . And I 'm slipping back . I can already feel it . The craving . You 've got to resist it . Is there anything I can do to help ? Tell Superboy . He has to stop me before it 's too late . I am losing control . Tell him that I 'm losing control . Byron ? Aaahhhh . You know , Lana , if I were you , I 'd wait ' til Clark got home , so he could tell Superboy . This town that Byron called from , that 's a long way away . It 's a long drive when you 're sticking your neck out . I owe him . If it wasn 't for Byron , I would ... Yeah , yeah , I know . You would have gotten bit by a vampire . But without his medicine , there 's nothing stopping him from turning into one , too . Lana , for all you know , he could be driving around this town in his very own bloodmobile . He knows I 'm a friend . He 's not gonna hurt me . Well , I 'm off . Wish me luck . Lana . If you wanted , I could come . You know . Great . Great . All right , listen , but I 'm not going vampire hunting empty handed . I 'll tell you what , I 'll meet you downstairs in an hour . Okay . Thanks . You 're a real sweetie . Hear that , big guy ? I 'm a sweetie . Huh . Now who 's the hero ? Just don 't take too long , huh . Love funeral homes . Do you think he 's in here ? Yo , Byron . Hello . Oh , hello , Ma . Yeah , it 's good to hear from you . Don 't be afraid , Andy . It 'll be fine . Afraid . Lana , my dear , I have come to terms with death . Oh . Bingo . Hey , hey . This is man 's work . Great . Death . Haha . Hello , Lana . I hate funeral homes . Part of me wanted you when we first met . Then Superboy stood between us . Now , it 's different . Now , I can offer you something he can 't . Eternal youth , Lana . And love . A love no mortal woman can ever imagine . Ma , I do go out on dates with Lana . Study dates . But how many times have I told you ? She thinks she 's in love with Superboy . I know that you want to be with me , forever , Lana . And all that you must say is , yes . Yes . This is not good . No , this is not good . Lana , this is definitely bad . Lana ? Lana is indisposed . Whoa , Byron . Gee , we didn 't wake you up , did we ? You know , if you wanna catch some zzz 's , I didn 't mess with your box or anything . You should never have come . Now hold it . We both know what happens when you smell this . Only the weakest among us can be repelled with the likes of that . Who do you think you 're playing with ? Yuh , okay . How about this , huh ? My turn now , bloodsucker . A cross is a most potent weapon , Andrew . But only as potent as the will behind it . And your will is no match for mine . Uh . I 'll try . I promise . Bye . Are you all right ? Yeah . Where 's Lana ? You didn 't see her ? Stay right there . Superboy , be careful . Watch your back . Lana . Superboy . It 's all right , I 'm here . You always show up just when I need you . And now you need me , don 't you ? You want me . Lana . You were perfect . It was so easy . Well , those who love us usually make the best prey . But what about his powers ? Why did he succumb ? Not even Superboy is immune to the supernatural . Soon , he will begin to turn . And when he awakens , he 'll be part of the fold . Now I know what I must do . And you will help me . Lana . The sun never used to hurt like this before . Soon , it will be fatal . As the curse progresses , we will only be able to go into the darkness . What 's it like to be undead ? First you must die with a second bite . That is the final baptism that makes a vampire whole . And it is only with that you can rise again . You 'll crave the darkness , shun the daylight . You 'll stalk humans and then drink their blood . You 'll be forever young , forever beautiful . Forever mine . Aaaaahhhhhh , aaahhhh ! Do you really think I 'm gonna believe that cockamamie story about a doctor who 's a vampire ? You can sell that one for the movies . Okay . All right . Look at it this way . Byron Shelley is just a guy with a medical condition . Like a diabetic without his Insulin . If he doesn 't have his serum , he goes crazy . This never would have happened if he didn 't have his bag stolen . My father is sending for us tonight . It 's all arranged . He answered your message . Oh , I knew that he would . Ever since the day that my mother took me away from him , he 's never stopped looking for me . I told him about you , Lana . He seemed pleased . I also told him that I was bringing a peace offering that he would not be able to refuse . Superboy . I gave it back to him , I gave that back . He say , " you 're not gonna like me off my medicine . " " You won 't like me . " So I had to give it back . That it ? Yeah . Thanks . So where 'd you get it ? That guy back there in the cage gave it to us . He said some man put some kind of voice in his head last night . This voice kept telling him to turn himself in . Shot his girlfriend . Byron did it . It 's a power that vampires have . They do it with their eyes . Don 't start up again . Sonny , maybe you ought to talk to Floyd . Let me guess . Floyd runs a barber shop , right ? Telegraph . Said a young man come in this morning , picked up a telegram and you ain 't gonna believe where it come from . Look at you . The more you struggle , the weaker you get . No . Heat in my blood . What it 's doing to me . It 's like a sensation I 've never felt before . I know . I don 't want it to end . Make it last forever . You hear that , superboy ? Lana is anxious for death . How about you ? Are you ready ? He approves of you , Lana . We are being invited aboard . You 're coming too , Superboy . But it will be my father 's bite that renders you undead . You will be my gift to him . And you will ride with the baggage . What is it ? Something 's wrong . He 's resisting my father . Aaaahhhhh . Aaaggghhh . No one defies the holy force of my father . I will if you take Lana . Byron . Lana . Superboy . I 'm over here , Andy . Oh , nice dress . Listen , I got this telegraph from Transylvania and ... Give her juice . Take care of her . Aaahhhh . We 've got a score to settle . Nobody hurts Lana . Superboy , no . That 's not your way . Andy , give me the serum . You ... You fought back . You really weren 't under the spell . You , my friend , are a force so good , not even the power of my father could overcome . Don 't lose this . No , I won 't . Thank you , Andrew . No problem . My serum will cure both of you completely . What about you ? I was born with the blood of my father in my veins . My cure is a different matter . Goodbye , Lana . Where will you go ? I have to keep running . Now , he 'll never stop searching for me . Byron , who 's your father ? My father is the Prince of Darkness . He is Count Dracula . Captioned by Grant Brown

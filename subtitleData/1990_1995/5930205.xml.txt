 They look pretty strong . Well done , Dr. Kori . Do you have enough money ? You can use it like bathwater , I don 't mind . Thank you so much , Baron . It 's not " bathwater , " it 's " hot water " . He may have enough money , but his brain is still coming up short . Now I 'll be able to get Satan back good ! " Superwarriors Crushed ! I Will Be the One Who Wins " The craziness surges toward us . This is no time for tears . I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold , and become our party 's leading man . That which you can lose yourself in will someday make you an incredible guy . NO ... TEN P-KAN The sky is clear IPPAI OPPAI I am feeling fine . The trouble is here , so enjoy , you naughty little boy , We Gotta Power ! Dragonball Z NO ... TEN P-KAN My head is clear , RA-MEN ROPPAI Mother doesn 't care . It 's the century 's end , so twist and twirl , you mischievous little girl , We Gotta Power ! Dragonball Z I hope No. 18 isn 't doing anything too rough . Kuririn-san , once No. 18-san gets the money from Satan-san , you 're going to treat us to whatever we want to eat , right ? Yeah . You can eat until your sides split . You just let me take care of it all . If you 're lying , I 'm going to pull your hair out , Kuririn-san . D-d-don 't be ridiculous ! It took some time to get it to grow out this far ! Papa ... Vroom-vroom ! H-hold up ! W-what 's this ? Hey , mister , enough of this already . The 20 million zeni you promised me at the Tenkaichi Tournament for letting you win ... I 'm telling you to hurry up and pay me in full . Y-you see , I haven 't yet gotten the prize money ... It looks to me like you want to get hurt . I-I 'll pay you ! If you could just wait a little while ... Just a minute ! Did you make an appointment with my secretary ? If you want an autograph , I 'll do that later . Right now , I 'm in the middle of something . I brought you a challenge from my cousin . A challenge ? Give that to my secretary . I get hundreds of those every day . For someone who wet the bed until he was in the 6th grade , you 've got a lot of nerve , don 't you ? Wet the bed ! ? Who told you that ! ? My cousin . The only one who knows about that is ... don 't tell me it 's Jaga ! That 's right , Jaga Butta . You can 't say you don 't know him . He knows everything about you . Yeah , we were friends growing up . We both devoted ourselves to training in order to become martial artists . You were rivals , weren 't you ? Yeah . But compared to the ultra-prodigy that I was , you have to feel bad for Jaga . Eventually , in the 6th grade , he was beaten by me , and he gave up his dreams of becoming a martial artist . I always end up having to do this . I don 't have time to fight Jaga right now . I 'm busy here . Go on . Off with you , off with you . Jaga wanted me to tell you something . If it looks like he 's going to turn you down , he said , then I will take your world champion belt , and on top of that , what happened when you were in 6th grade will - Shut up ! It was only that one time when I stayed the night that summer ! One time , two times , it 's all the same . Hey ! I was here first , you disrespectful lout ! Take care of this after I 'm finished with him . If you say no , then I 'll go to the press with how , until you were in the 6th grade ... All right ! I just have to fight Jaga , right ? No , you 'll fight the Biowarriors that Jaga has developed . Biowarriors ! ? Hey , Trunks , switch places . Let me see , too ! D-don 't tell me that among them , there 's anyone whose hair turns golden and stands up on end , is there ? Whoever heard of anyone like that ? Okay then . I 'm going to go beat someone easily , and then be right back , so just wait a minute for me . I 'm not falling for that . You 're planning on running away from me , right ? You put on a poor act . I 'm going with you ! And that 's what 's going on . You can head on back to Kame House . I 'll come with you . You have to look after our girl , here . But , No. 18 ... You 're not going to do what I ask you ? Okay , then . I 'll stay home . Be careful ! Come home soon ! Oh , those guys ! Damn , it 's nice to be single , huh ? Papa , go potty ! D-don 't go yet ! Hold on ! Hold on ! Hold on ! Bathroom ! Bathroom ! Aah , and out it comes ... There doesn 't seem to be anyone too great here . I am the world champion , the famous Mister Satan ! Nice one ! Though the sun is awfully bright ... It 's been a long time , huh Satan ? Welcome to May Queen Castle . Menmen , nice work . Baron Jaga Butta ! Y-you 're him ? You 're not at all the way I remember you . Apparently , you 've succeeded your pop and become a baron , but what is the deal with that pudgy little body of yours ? Training ! Do some training ! Who is this young miss , here ? She 's my number one pupil . Number one pupil , am I ? Cut that out , Goten ! It tickles , you know ! G-Goten , I 'm no good around these things ! You 're a cutie , aren 't you ? There , there , there . Go off someplace else , okay ? Being raised on Mount Paozu , I guess he 's used to this . If you hadn 't been around , I would have been the world champion ! That 's right . Jaga has lived his life up to today with the intent of making you pay . Are you going to apologize to him ? You 're as obsessed as ever . When you lost to me as a child , you would follow me all the way into the bathroom , crying the whole time . Ha ! That 's all in the past ! With all of this surplus money I have , I 've employed the finest biotechnology experts out there , and had them create these Biowarriors ! You 're going to fight these warriors , who I am so proud of , in my Battle Stage ! This will be a waste of your efforts . Goten , this is starting to get exciting , huh ? Mm-hmm . Trunks-kun , what 's a Biowarrior ? It 's a warrior that was created with biotechnology , right ? What 's biotechnology ? You don 't know anything , huh ? It 's genetic engineering . They can even make new creatures out of existing cells . Trunks-kun , you 're amazing ! Both Mama and Grandpa are scientists , after all , so this sort of thing is common knowledge to me . So then , what 's genetic engineering ? Well ? Genetic engineering is ... How silly ! It 's obviously biotechnology , you know ? Ah , so that 's it . All right ! Ee-yow ! Satan , this is the Battle Stage ! Why aren 't there any spectators ? There aren 't any TV cameras here either , are there ? It 's rude to treat me , the world champion , in this way , isn 't it ? You big show-off . Menmen ? Yes ? Here 's a camera for you . Awesome ! I 'd like to fight in a place like this ! He 's rich , after all . Huh ? Trunks-kun , that man ... Behind that Baron whatever-his-name-is ... It 's the prayergiver from when we were in Natade Village ! What 's he doing here ? Well , let 's hurry and get this started . I 'm busy . N-No . 18 ! How would you like to go at them for a bit ? If you 'll add on another 20 million zeni . R-right . Okay , who 's first ? My number one pupil , No. 18 , will face you . Not so fast ! I will decide the match-ups ! I want to go back with Satan , quickly ! Let 's not make things too difficult , and settle this in a Battle Royale ! I 'll defeat the whole lot of you in place of Satan ! No way ! That goes against the spirit of fair spray ! You dummy . What you meant to say was " fair play " . We 're going to join in , too ! Is that ? What is this ? Old man Onjichama-onbachama , long time no see . You know them ? Y-yes . Fellas , this is not the Junior Round of the Tenkaichi Tournament . You have to be 18 years old to enter here . Right , right . These Biowarriors are too strong for you . I wish you would give us some credit . We can do this sort of thing . These kids are your pupils too , aren 't they ? They 're using cheap tricks ! You can 't fool my eyes ! All right , fine ! Biowarriors , turn this place into a villagefest with those guys ! Villagefest ? What you meant to say is " bloodfest " . They 're both festivals ! Yow-ow-ow ! That 's fighting dirty ! What sort of folks are these ? This is bad ! I wonder if they realize ... Jaga , how do you like my pupils ' strength ? I didn 't even have to join in . This is getting worse and worse . Now , while I still have a chance ... Prayergiver , where are you going ? Things are just about to get interesting . J-just heading to the bathroom . Hold it in . O-okay . All right ! Now comes the real thing ! Satan , I still have a trump card to play ! Don 't be too stunned when you see him ! If you 're going to apologize , now 's the time ! Jaga , you sound like a beaten dog , whining from a distance . No worries . Bring out anyone you want . No matter who you bring out , they won 't be any match for us . Right , guys ? Ooh , geez , you 're so smug ! Damn it , f-fine ! I 'll show you ! Satan-chan , it 's the end of the line for you ! Awesome ! Say , miss , how do you make Biowarriors ? That might be a little too hard for you boys to understand . I know that biotechnology is genetic engineering ! Oh my , that 's amazing ! My mama is good when it comes to mechanics . T-Trunks-kun ... What is it ? T-that one has a tail ! Like a Saiyan , huh ? B-Broli ! B-but we completely wiped him out that time with a Kamehame-Ha ... Uh-huh ... He 's supposed to be dead ! That 's not fair , huh ? Uh-uh ... Jaga , whoever you send out , the result will be the same . You 're just wasting your money . Shut up ! Okay , Doctor , send out the superwarrior ! Nain , remove the culture fluid , would you ? Yes , Dr. Kori . T-Trunks-kun ... I-I think I 'm going to wet myself again ... This time , I will clobber him . No. 18 , stay out of this . Hmph ! Suit yourself . Who 's it going to be ! ? Hey , Mister ! You 're the one who brought Broli here , huh ? Thanks to you , I lost all face as the prayergiver of Natade Village . Nobody asks me to do any work for them any more ! Did Broli survive ? Broli died . He was beaten so badly by you , there wasn 't any trace left . What is in there is a Broli that has been regenerated through bio-power from his genes ! I took some of the dried blood that was inside the space pod , and sold it to the baron . From there , the superb bioscientists employed by the baron took that single drop of Broli 's blood , and did a magnificent job of bringing the mightiest of warriors back to life . That can 't be ! Mister , if Broli comes back to life , do you know what 's going to happen ? Which is why I 'm leaving the rest up to you guys ! What should we do , Trunks-kun ? Hei ! Can you tell how incredible he is , too ? Relax . The superwarrior has been made to respond to all orders given in my voice . He 's on our side . Goten , if it 's going to come to that , let 's blow away the capsule that Broli is in before he comes out ! Mm-hmm ! Ka ... me ... What about a kame ( " turtle " ) ? I-I 'll bet it 's another trick ! Those kids ! What do they think they 're doing ! ? Ha ... me ... Nain , the culture fluid is spilling out ! Shift the protective walls around number 13 ! Right ! He 's out ! What do we do ? Hei ! Stop ! He 's on our side ! Hei ! W-w-what kind of fluid is that ! ? Nain ! Dispose of that culture fluid at once ! When the culture fluid comes in contact with the air , it devours the cells of any genetically differing life form , and multiplies itself over and over , until it is beyond our control ! Right ! Now , superwarrior , show me your power ! Defeat Satan ! No. 18 ! You go first after all ! All right . This will add on another 20 million zeni . Once I defeat him , we 're heading back immediately , got it ? Then you 'll pay up ! F-fine ! If we get home safely , I 'll pay you as much as you want ! Don 't forget those words ! No. 18-san ! I can 't believe this thing exists . It 's one unbelievable monster ! 20 million zeni is too inexpensive ! Way to go ! How do you like that ? Looks pretty painful , Satan ! This is the real thing ! You can apologize now , but I still won 't let you off ! Now , for all the years ' worth of bitterness I 've harbored , pound Satan to a pulp ! I-I 'll be killed ! T-time out a second ! My stomach is starting to hurt ! Save us ! Pops , what are you so afraid of ! ? You 're the world champion , right ? You 've got to fight back ! R-right . But my stomach hurts ... Trunks-kun ! Goten , we 're not going to be beaten this time ! Uh-uh ! Oh ! Golden warriors ! Now things are going to be fine ! We 're not about to be beaten up twice ! We won 't fall for the same trick again ! Stop ! If any more of that culture fluid is spilled ... if that were to happen ! Hey , Broli ! I can see through all of your slow moves ! How long did you think those same energy blasts were going to work ? Stop ! That 's enough ! Stop ! We can take him , Goten ! I can see how he 's going to move next ! I can see , too ! Save us ! We 're falling ! It 's no use ! Let us out of here , quick ! The culture fluid is coming ! All right , this is all of it . What 's this ! ? Onbachama jichama ! Yayakoni totsama ! W-what is it ? Push the emergency button ! What 's going on ! ? Open the door ! Open up ! Open up ! Open up ! We 're saved ! Goten ! Hit him from your side ! What ! ? Save us ! If I stay here , no matter how many lives I have , it won 't be enough ! You bastard ! Are you okay ? I was worried about you . A husband ought to at least rescue his own wife , right ? Kuririn-san ! Goten , now ! All right ! Goten , we 've got him ! Uh-huh ! Help me ! Goten ! Goten ! What are you doing ! ? I can 't do this alone ! My shoulder ! Stop ! That 's far enough ! He 's going to die ! I 'm the one who brought you back to life ! Listen to what I say ! You 'll pay for that ! M-my shoulder ! Rats ! If only my shoulder wasn 't hurt ! Kienzan ! G-Goten ! What should I do ? Help us ! Help us ! Help us ! T-that 's it ! That 's got to be it ! Broli ! Hey ! I 'll give you a spanky-spanky ! What 's the matter , Broli ? Get over here , now , and I 'll kill you ! If you don 't like it , come over here and do something about it ! Now ! Take this , Broli ! I-I did it ! Goten ! Goten ! Goten ! We made it ! Where 's Broli ? He 's in that fluid . Instead of power , I used up here , up here ! I 'm ruined ! I 've lost everything ! You idiot ! You 're going to lose your life before you 've lost everything else ! Goten , we 've got to save everyone ! Hold on tight ! If you fall , you 'll be out for good ! Right ! Hurry up and go ! D-don 't push , No. 18 ! You old guys , hang onto me . You 'd save me , even after setting all of this up ? Jaga , you 've got to follow his spirit of hair spray ! It 's no use . It has no effect whatsoever . Isn 't there anything we can do about that fluid ! ? That culture fluid 's replicative power becomes stronger when it devours the cells of a differing life form . Since it has taken in the cells of that Broli monster , it has obtained extraordinary power ! At this rate , it will cover the entire earth ! It 's the end of the world ! I 've done something terrible ! Take a good look at yourself ! Hey , you 're in on this too , Mister ! You 're right . Help me ! Get away ! I 'm the world champion , Mister Satan ! I get it . The fluid is vulnerable to the seawater . We can stop the fluid ! Hurry ! Let 's go ! Ka ... me ... ha ... me ... HA ! Goten , we did it ! Uh-huh ! Goten , way to figure that out ! It was all thanks to Satan-san . Even he comes in handy once in a while , huh ? Kakarrot ! What 's with this guy ! ? We 've had it now ! We 're done for ! Look ! You bastard ! Startle us , will you ? That is one tenacious bastard . Now , Broli is finished for good ! Uh-huh . Hey ! Someone pick me up ! All right . My pick-up fare is 40 million zeni , which altogether comes to 100 million zeni ! You 're kidding ! That 's one stubborn guy ! What ? Kaio-sama said for me to go to Hell again with Paikuhan , and put down Broli , who is running amuck ? There 's just no helping that Broli , huh ? All right , but before I do , I guess I can 't fight on an empty stomach . Let me eat first , okay ? D ! R ! A ! G ! O ! N ! Dragon Power ! D ! R ! A ! G ! O ! N ! Dragon Power ! Power ! Power ! Power ! Dragon Power ! From faraway in the darkness , they come ... Biowarriors , with their genetics rearranged . Against a guy that cannot be defeated alone , if our two hearts meld into one , Victory will smile on us ! D ! Doesn 't matter how long , R ! Remain moving forward , A ! Affirming endless love ! GO ! Fight ! Go ! Go ! Go ! N ! No need to hold back ! The future for the two of us is unlimited ! D ! R ! A ! G ! O ! N ! Dragon Power ! D ! R ! A ! G ! O ! N ! Dragon Power ! Power ! Power ! Power ! Dragon Power !

 Gentlemen ... as all of you know , Dr. Prescott , Dr. Lazaar and myself ... have , for the last 10 months , been engaged in Project XYZ . Each of us was working on a separate phase of the project ... under a security system only you ... who serve and protect our mighty nation so admirably ... are capable of devising . It was to take the sum total of our combined knowledge ... to ever implement Project XYZ . But in spite of your ingenuity ... a combination of our general knowledge alone ... was enough for us to realize that we had developed ... a terrible weapon . A weapon that would escalate the current arms race ... to nightmare proportions . And so , upon discovering ... the true dimensions of our unconscionable task ... we burned every note , every equation ... every trace of our work . Gentlemen , we have destroyed the XYZ nightmare . Destroyed the XYZ nightmare ... Destroyed the XYZ nightmare ... It 's an android ! That 's Dr. Royce Tobias , the day he signed on to my project . That 's Dr. Royce Tobias yesterday morning . You 're kidding . What 's left of an intricately built human robot . Somewhere along the line the real doctor was replaced by an android . Now he and all he knows about Project XYZ are missing . You did say it would take all three scientists ... to develop the XYZ weapon . Was that right ? Yes , that 's a small consolation . There 's no possibility that the other two scientists might short-circuit ? No . Prescott and Lazaar are still flesh and blood ... but we 've got to make sure they stay that way . - When did they abort the project ? - Two days ago . They came and told me right after they burned their notes . So then , if they were working right up till that time ... Tobias had to have been replaced after XYZ was aborted , right ? That 's right . I guess we have to find out exactly when the switch was made . I 'll start at Tobias ' laboratory , see if I can find anything there . Good . Well , Diana , looks like we 'll be seeing quite a lot of each other . Yeah , I guess the more I find out , the more questions I 'll have for you , Dex . Why can 't you plan on asking me those questions ... over dinner one of these evenings ? More likely , I 'll be ... asking them over the telephone . Hey , Dex ... remember what I used to tell you in college ? Yeah . " Confine your passes to the football field . " Thank you very much . I 'll close the door behind me . Lady , stay right where you are , and don 't move . You understand ? Stay right there , that 's just fine . Gotten enough exercise ? Now , in 50 words or less , tell me why you were in that laboratory . No , I can 't . You have to . You can 't lie . I can 't ... Whatever you were programmed for , I guess it wasn 't for truth . Dr. Prescott wasn 't too happy with his new living arrangements . Lazaar had some colorful phrases about the security measures where he is , too . Not good . We 've got guards at every entrance ... every elevator , and at their rooms in both buildings . - They may not be happy , but they are safe . - Good . Trevor . Steve , it 's Diana . Listen , I 'm at Dr. Tobias ' . When I got here , I wasn 't alone . I was greeted by another android . What happened ? Let 's just say he broke down under pressure . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . But I 'd like to know ... why I 'm standing in a physicist 's laboratory ... looking at a battalion of toy soldiers . Just a second . Diana found some toy soldiers at Tobias ' apartment . Does he have some kind of a hobby ? All three scientists play war games ... with miniature soldiers for relaxation . Did you hear that , Diana ? Yes . I guess only geniuses can play with toys when they 're over 50 ... and get away with it . Right . You let us know if you find anything else , will you ? Right . This is torture . Yes . Dr. Prescott ? It 's not as if I could have gone anywhere . You expecting these ? Somebody just brought them by for you . Yes , thank you , my good man . Thank you so much . Yes , now , Dr Lazaar ... we shall see just who should have won the Battle of Chateau Thierry . Now , I 'll put this here for the moment . You can go in an emplacement , Commander ... and I 'll put this cannon here . Yes , here , and here . Now , I get some positioning on this . I told Lazaar not to move his men up so quickly . They 'll be moved out of position ... and this infantry here ... What is the ... Hello , Dr. Prescott . You 're going to do exactly what I tell you to . Now , listen ... A new friend , a little noisy but very smart . And you have all these friends to meet . So much to do ! Just when I was going to introduce all of you . Keep an eye on them , will you ? You , with that flirty smile , you take care of the introductions . Make sure he feels at home . Yes , coming . Come . Yeah , I have another guest ? Let me see . Mine is better . Mine are always better . Put it in that cage . So the android Diana ran into ... was supposed to retrieve something from the laboratory ? A reasonable deduction . It was probably sent to find and remove ... a clue to Dr. Tobias ' disappearance . I wish I could advise you that we 've identified that clue , but - No need to explain . I am Well acquainted with human fallibility . May I make a suggestion ? Of course . That 's why I keep you well-oiled . According to data just received ... the key to Dr. Tobias ' disappearance ... Would seem to lie With the place where he spent most ofhis time . Right . Therefore , I suggest that you carefully ... examine the present domiciles of the two remaining scientists . I 'm one step ahead of you , Ira . Diana 's on her way to Prescott 's for that very reason . I 'll give you a chance to make another suggestion . Do not do me any favors . It 's almost Christmas . Affirmative . I want to buy Diana a present , but I don 't know what to get her . With everything you know about her , what do you suggest ? I suggest you talk to Wonder Woman . You 're a big help . Dr. Prescott . Yes , come in . Hi , I 'm Diana Prince from the IADC . I don 't care if you were from the IADC or the FDIC . I can 't tell you how happy I am to have some company . Such lovely company at that , too . Thank you very much , but I have some questions - Please sit down , we 'll have a lovely chat . - I really can 't stay - - Yes , you can . - I need to ask a few questions . - Would you like some tea ? - Please . - I don 't ... Doctor , all I want to find out ... is when the android switched places with Dr. Tobias ... - so the XYZ weapon - - Plenty of time for questions later . ... won 't fall into the wrong hands . I 'll have some tea . First , we 'll turn on the burner ... and the water . Perhaps a cookie ? This is going to be very nice . Isn 't this a rather strange hobby for the three of you ? What ? No , you see ... battle strategy , actually the art of it , is fascinating . But you aborted Project XYZ . That 's quite another matter , you see . We felt war should be kept on the level of fantasy . Unlike our superiors . Now , I have a little mint ... No . - A little orange pekoe ? - Really , I don 't want anything . - You 'll love this one - - Doctor , please . Just listen , I don 't have time for tea . - No one has time for tea - - Okay , let 's get down to brass tacks . After you burned your notes on the project ... did Dr. Tobias go anywhere with anyone unusual ? I 've already answered these questions enough . No . But a robot can 't just switch places with somebody without ... My tolerance for pain is astonishing , isn 't it ? Remarkable . That burner 's red-hot . Prescott 's been replaced by an android ? That 's right . I had him taken to Valley Medical . The doctors there confirmed it . How could that have happened ? The guards in and around Prescott 's apartment have no idea . They swear that Prescott never left , that he had no visitors ... and that he did nothing unusual . Yet somebody was able to make the switch . Wait until Dex hears about this . In any event , I 'm having Dr. Lazaar checked out . I 'm going there now . Looks like he 's the only one between somebody and the XYZ weapon . Steve , if he 's still flesh and blood , it means that ... either he 's next in line to be replaced by an android ... or he 's the one doing the replacing . And if he isn 't flesh and blood , the consequences are unthinkable . There 's still one more thing I intend to look into . I 'll call you later . I must say , this has been one of my more unusual house calls . I 've checked people for colds , flu , virus ... but never for not being human . Thank you , Doctor . You 're the only one that hasn 't been replaced with an android . The nightmare just goes on and on . Security will have to be tightened . It may mean moving you again . Just make it end , young lady . Just make it end . Then you 'll understand that since you are the only one left ... there 's another course of the investigation I have to take . Of course . You 'll have to inquire as to whether ... I 'm the one putting the XYZ weapon together . Right . You 'll check out my friends ... see if I have any questionable ties with foreign countries ... and look for evidence that I 'm under some great financial strain . - It has to be done . - Understood . But let me point out right now , it will prove fruitless . I 'm responsible for what 's happened ... only insofar as 10 months ago , I agreed to work with Dexter ... in this awful undertaking . - Where do you get these ? - Soldiers ? From a toy shop in Georgetown . On Blakely Street . Merry Christmas and Happy New Year . May I help you ? I thought you were one of the dolls . Did you ? I was being quiet on purpose for this one . It 's naptime . Well , she 's cute . You like her . Maybe I could show you a doll ? No , I 'm interested in toy soldiers . I have something that 'll light up your child 's eyes ... like two moons . - No - - Look . Actually I 'm interested in miniature troops . - Miniature troops ? - Tinkertown troops . That 's the brand name . I saw some World War I models . But why would such a pretty woman like you ... take up such morbid pastimes ? They 're not for me . They 're for a friend for Christmas . He studies Von Clausewitz as a hobby . No miniature troops . - Perhaps the shop on Maple - - You don 't carry them ? - No . - I was told you did . You try the shop on Maple . Just north of Third Street . Okay , thank you . Miss ... this time of year , an old man like me ... gets tired , and sometimes very rude . Maybe you 'll accept this gift for your dashboard in your car ... and perhaps forgive a tired old man . All right . Thank you very much , and Merry Christmas . The same to you . Bye . My friends , did you hear that ? She is a lady agent . She 's got to be stopped . My love . At last , your first voyage . Your maiden voyage . For it is a maiden that you shall be destroying . Tired old man , my eye . You 'll be my most perfect ... the crème de la crème de la crème . Now , turn around . Because of you , my love ... all of my friends and I ... will be happy for a long time . Now , let me see that great big smile . Now , let me get this straight . - You were strafed by a model airplane ? - That 's right . There 's a tree out on County Line Road with enough holes in it to prove it . What 's the name of this toy maker ? We 'll have him checked out . Orlich Hoffman , and he runs the Jungle King shop on Blakely . Dr. Lazaar is gone . - Gone ? - He 's not in the safe house we arranged . It 's all right . I had him moved . You what ? Well , it was obvious to me that after we lost Dr. Prescott ... our security measures were a little inadequate . So I had him moved . Good work , Diana . Where is he now ? He 's out of any and all possible danger . But exactly where is he ? I 'd just as soon spare you the burdensome details , Dex . Diana 's right . The fewer people that know , the better . Including you and me . I don 't know ... How can we be sure her safety precautions will be tight enough ? We 'll just have to trust her . Steve , Project XYZ was mine . If anything goes wrong , the world will blame me , not her . Relax , Dex . Trust her . Like I told you before , she 's the best . I see . This list contains the date and nature of all informational transactions ... concerning Major Dexter that I have made . In code , of course . You mean , you can tell me if anything 's been added or deleted ... from your memory banks ? Affirmative . Has anything ever been deleted ? Coded item E4F87 ... indicates a name was deleted ... from his list of associates in August oflast year . Can you tell me the name ? Negative . It has been erased from my memory . Can you tell me where it used to be on the list ? The name was positioned between the names Henderson , Michael T ... and Ingalls , Barbara A. Between " H " and " I " . Hoffman . It could have been Hoffman 's name that was removed from the list . A sound deduction . The name fits into the alphabetical sequence . Dexter wanted to remove any connection ... between himself and that toy maker . He 's been behind it all along . Thank you very much , Ira . Thank you , Miss Prince . Merry Christmas , Ira . And a Merry Christmas to you . Ho , ho , ho . She got away ... from my plane . It 's just as well . She 's the only one who knows where Lazaar is . We need her alive , and fast ! Well , then , let 's get her back , like we planned . No . I need a guarantee this time . Your over-sized dolls don 't exactly have a flawless performance record . - Yeah , but they get better . - I don 't want better . I want perfect ! I want that guarantee . If anything goes wrong with this one - Nothing will go wrong . I 'm this far , Hoffman . I 've been shining my shoes like a good boy ... and saying " Yes , sir " and " No , sir " to idiots in uniform for 15 years ... just waiting for something like XYZ to come along . And I am this far from making it pay off ! - I know ! - This far from never having to sweat ... or worry , or take orders , or put up with anybody 's stupidity ever again ! Now , I 'm depending on you ! And you can and you should . You 're the one human being who believed in me ... and what my toys could do . You can depend on us . All right . We 'll pick up Dr. Lazaar in the morning . And then we 'll ship him out with the other two doctors ... and send them to my buyer out of the country . And then we 'll reap the rewards of Project XYZ . - We won 't let you down . - That 's right . You won 't . Because if you do , you won 't be alive . Get ready . - Hello ? - Hello ? Diana . This is Dexter . I have some wonderful news for you . I 've found somebody who knows the whereabouts ... of Dr. Tobias and Dr. Prescott . Really ? Yes . I 'd like you to meet this person at midnight ... at the southwest corner of Perry Park . I 'm gonna have to clear this with Steve , you know . Listen , I 'll save you a dime . Steve 's right here . Diana ? There 's no time to explain . Just be at the park in 20 minutes like Dex said . Call me When you have Tobias and Prescott . Okay ? - Hello , Diana . - Hello ... Wonder Woman . You 've been working on the XYZ case all along ? Yes . From the moment Dr. Tobias disappeared ... I knew the safety of the entire world was at stake . And you found the doctors ? Yes , in the basement of that toy shop . - Let 's go . - Anything you say . Well , Diana ... this is your little night for surprises , isn 't it ? - Not really . - Oh , come now . Don 't tell me I was high on your hit parade of suspects all along ? Let 's just say I wasn 't blinded by faith the way Steve was . Yes , I always say , there 's nothing like a good friend . - Right , Orlich ? - Yes . One could always use a good friend . Absolutely . Now , Diana , where is Dr. Lazaar ? - You can 't possibly believe I 'd tell you . - No , I don 't . Orlich ? - My good friend ... - My good friend . Yes . Now , Diana ... you can 't help but tell me where you 've hidden the good Dr. Lazaar . Where is he ? I can 't . He 's the only one left . Where is Dr. Lazaar ? Where did you arrange to have him held ? My apartment ... 410 ... in the Spruce Building . Under what kind of guard ? One plainclothesman at the door ... a guard at the elevator ... armed , both of them ... and two cars circling all the time . Was there a password ? Yes , the guard at the door ... is " alphabet soup . " Alphabet soup . Any other safety precautions ? No , the simpler , the better . How thoughtful . Go to sleep , now , Diana . Have a nice long nap . Make sure she stays under . I 'm going to get Lazaar . I want you to load up Tobias and Prescott , get them into the van ... and meet me at the dam at precisely 11 : 00 . - You got that ? 00 . But the lady . She was not in our plans . You don 't have to worry about her . After we 're all through , we 'll find Sleeping Beauty ... a nice quiet place where she can just go right on sleeping . Forever . Lock the door . Good morning . I wonder if I might be able to interest you in a bowl of alphabet soup ? Yes , sir . Come in , please . It 's almost 11 : 00 . We have to get them loaded and on our way . Come . At this rate we 'll never get him out of the basement ... let alone the country . I did pretty well giving you strength ... but not too good when it comes to showing respect for your elders . As soon as we get Dr. Tobias , we should be on our way . What 's this ? Oh , Mommy . You should have stuck to the toys you were best at , Mr. Hoffman . The harmless ones . Stop her . What you do now ? I 'm going to get Dr. Tobias . It 's almost 11 : 00 . Right . Good . I 'll go warm up the van . - Dexter . - You 're late . We were unavoidably detained by Wonder Woman . - Wonder Woman ? - Yeah , she attempted to foil our efforts . - You stupid fool ! What happened ? - She failed . As you can see , we are here . The two doctors are in the back of the van . You have Dr. Lazaar . Yes , he 's in the car . We 've got to reunite the three , send them out of the country ... and we 'll be rich men . - Get Lazaar . - My dear . A pleasure . You know , with most of your androids , I can tell them from the real thing . - Nonsense , my boy . - No , I can . I really can . Nobody else can . But I know your dolls from the real thing . And I want to tell you something . This one looks like the real thing . I told you , they get better . This one 's perfect . - She fools even you . - Don 't count on it . Am I to carry Dr. Lazaar all the way out of the country ... or do you want him in the van ? You see ? She even has a sense of humor . " Am I to carry or not ? " - Get back , Hoffman . - What are you doing ? If she 's one of your androids , you can rebuild her . - If she 's not ... - No ! Dexter ... the disadvantage of rear wheel drive . She was here last night and no one 's seen her since . Of course , I 'm concerned . Why she 's ... She 's standing right here . I 'll call you later . Sorry , but I would have called in . I couldn 't . - I found the missing scientists . - Tobias and Prescott ? And Lazaar . Wonder Woman got to them just before they were shipped out of the country . - By whom ? Who 's behind all this ? - Major Dexter . Dex ? Yes , with the help of the little toy maker , Hoffman . They were about to sell the XYZ weapon to a foreign country . Wonder Woman has them both under wraps . I 'll call the police . No . Wait a minute . She suggested we let them think their plan worked . What ? She used her golden lasso to make them forget they were caught . Now it 's our turn to replace the scientists with androids . You mean , let them ship fake scientists out of the country ? Arresting Dexter and Hoffman would only publicize this whole thing . And the more people that know about it ... the greater the chances are that someone else will try it . Yeah , that way , everybody would get ... or everybody 'd think they 'd be getting , exactly what they want . Right . And the XYZ weapon can finally be forgotten once and for all . Wonder Woman 's right again , as usual . Let 's get started . Everything 's all set . Hoffman happened to store extra androids for the scientists ... in the basement of his toy shop . - They 're already at the dam . - And the real scientists ? Safe and sound at Valley Medical . - What do you say we get a ringside seat ? - Let 's do . Shall we ? They think everything is going as planned . What will whoever bought the weapon do when they find out ? That they 've paid for three androids ? Who wouldn 't know Project XYZ from a science fair project . I 'd say they 'd be furious . They 'll see to it that Hoffman and Dex get just what they deserve . It 's always tough learning who the people are you can really trust . Yeah . But I 'll tell you something , Diana . It 's a really good feeling to know that there are people you can trust . Wonder Woman . That 's one person who 'll never let me down . I 'd say you 're right about that . Which reminds me . Excuse me .

 - So this is how it begins . - Daddy , help me ! Daddy ! Daddy , come quick ! Help ! Dad ! Honey ? That looks good . Is it decaf ? Did you want decaf , darling ? No , no , no , that 's fine . That 's fine . Wow , look at that foam , looks good . You have some real skill there . You know I 'm a damn household goddess , Harry . Bagel 's on the way . Oh , what a night . - Remember your dream ? - It was weird , remember that much . - Scared the hell out of me . - Where 's the kids ? Little Buddha 's getting her bag , and I think Coty has a bug so I 'm keeping him home today . Why do bugs love that kid so much ? Because he 's juicy . Oh , he had a callback for a toothpaste commercial . Should I have his tummy checked ? No , he just has a nervous stomach . Like his old man . Waitress , I think your bacon 's burning . - A little charred . - I like it that . - I 'll put another one in . - I said bring it here , woman . - Such a nasty man . - Thank you . - Here she is . - Oh , my Deirdre straight from the tub . Come here , you . There 's the wet Little Buddha . - I 'll check on the stomachacher . - Okay . Wow . This stuff is great . I have a bug . Yeah ? Well , you 're just gonna have to scare that bug away , Mr. Blue . Love you , Daddy . Mr. Latimer said that he had the paperwork ready . - Hi , Harry . - Good morning . - Good morning . - Groovy dress . Thanks . Got it at your wife 's store . Things are getting just a little too incestuous , Paula . You 're fired . Harry , I forgot to tell you , my kid 's in a play today ... - ... and I have to leave at 4 : 00 . - Go ahead , abandon me . What do we got for lunch ? - Hey , Jude . - Hey . Off my desk , Morty . You have a 1 : 00 with Mr. Lazlo at City . Is that on Third or Sixth ? - La Brea and Second . - La Brea and Second . Jeez . So when is the special day ? Morty and I are getting married . Thought you should know . Harry , don 't be coy . Everybody knows you 're making partner . - Rumor , Morty , rumor . - You are so abstract . - Paige Katz is here . - Great . Send her in . - Who 's Paige Katz ? - Morty , bye . Come on . - Did I tell you Annie 's pregnant again ? - That 's great . Really great . She 's always complaining about bloat so I told her to tell everybody she 's retaining daughter . - Do you love it ? - I love it . Come on . Come on . - Catch you later . - Okay . Partner . Come on , come on . Go , Morty . This is gonna be a weird day . Paige . I felt funny calling . Oh , no , it 's great to see you . Please sit down . Would you like a cappuccino or some mineral water ? No , thanks . You look great . Just great . - It 's a little out of the blue . - Blast from the past ? - How long has it been now ? - Fifteen years . You 're married , naturally . Yes . - Happily ? - Naturally . - Kids ? - Two . You ? I have a son out of wedlock . You work ? I 'm a consultant for the Wild Palms Group . - Two kids , huh ? - Yeah . I always knew you were daddy material . Well , that 's a ... Thank you . You came to speak to me about something ? I want you to help me find someone . Paige , it 's a little Raymond Chandler , don 't you think ? - I 'm a patent attorney . - It 's my son , Peter . He disappeared five years ago . See you soon . - Hey , Oakley , what 's happening ? - Your mom called . Oh , no , I was supposed to pick her up . Why am I doing this , Oakley ? I 'm an adult woman . I have a life . Why do I feel compelled to pick her up at the hospital ? - After her 57th face-lift . - Do you want me to answer that ? No , not really . Isn 't that Tabba Schwarzkopf ? - The actress ? - It is . - She 's coming in . - Easy , Grace . You see her in Magnificent Obsession ? - That 10th time they made that ? - She was so great . Hi . I need to ask you something which will probably arouse ... - ... a sickening contempt . - You need to use the phone . - Worse , the bathroom . - Oh , no . - I 'm a terrible person . - But you break just like a little girl . Oakley , would you please show Miss Schwarzkopf the communal loo ? She even knows my name . It 's so sad . - I 've seen all your movies . - I 've used all your bathrooms . You look fabulous . Doesn 't she ? Never again . It hurt this time . - They did a terrific job . - Goodbye , Cruella . - This is Cruella De Vil . - I 'm Grace , daughter . She a horror ? - A delight . - They 'll say anything . They 're so thrilled you 're leaving . It 's like they 're high on something . Mother . Never again . See you in six months . - Bye , Cruella . - Bye . I 'm looking for ... here . Light of my life , how are you ? You 're late , you son of a gun . I 'm starving . They 've got monkfish today to die for . You 're going in with me on the souffl√© . I already ordered . You got a parasite in there , Tommy ? How goes it on the partner front . Any word yet ? - Nothing definitive . - Hey , it 's a done deal . - Guess who I ran into today . - Who ? - Paige Katz . - From school ? You 're kidding . Where ? Came into the office . - How 'd she look ? - Unbelievable . Had a kid . Disappeared or something . - A custody thing ? - I don 't know . She didn 't tell me ... - ... anything about the father . - Very film noir . That 's what I said . Man , she is hot . Brought back a lot of memories . She 's sitting there telling me this tale and all I 'm doing is looking at the hair on her arms . - I wanna bring her down by the neck . - She really got to you , huh ? You know it 's a fine line between empathy and animal lust . - Get your hands off me . - Hey , hold on there . What are you doing ? - Stop it ! - Can 't do that . What are you doing ? - Settle this now . - Move ! Hey , hey . Are you all right ? Ma 'am ? - Tommy , what was that ? - Hey , that was stupid . So was it the police ? I 've never seen anything like that . They hurt that guy . Do we need more time ? Tell me about the monkfish again . I 'm telling you the sauce is killer . Grammy . Careful , dear , your grammy might just unravel . - How are you feeling , baby ? - I 'm fine . - What , were you sick , darling ? - I had a bug . He always gets better around 3 ... - ... when school 's out . - Shut up , Tambor . We do not tell people to shut up in this house . Am I the ultimate grandma ? - And are you the ultimate baby girl ? - Mom , be careful . - Tambor , take her . - Do you have something to say to me , Buddha girl ? Do you , do you , Deirdre ? - Are their bags packed ? - All set . Mom , I don 't want this one going in the pool . Look , I said I 'm better . When your mother says no pool , no pool . - Grammy , watch me Rollerblade . - Okay , in a second . - Okay . - Use the knee guards , Coty . How 's Deirdre 's latest guy ? All the experts have a different opinion . That 's why they 're experts . Don 't make yourself crazy . When she 's ready , she 'll talk . Comes from a long line of willful women , that 's all . You in trouble , Grace ? - Trouble ? - You and Harry . We 're fine . Why do you ask ? - Just a feeling . - Well , it 's a wrong feeling . Is he still seeing the shrink ? Yeah . He 's having nightmares . Grace and I haven 't made love in over two months . That 's a record . - Except for when she had her ectopic . - Well , it happens . Couples go through periods . You know , I always promised myself a beach house . I 'm supposed to have a beach house by now . I couldn 't even give Grace the money for her store . She had to get it from her mother . Do you think she loves you any less ? An old lover of mine came into my office this morning . Awakened something . And then something strange happened at lunch . I 'm sorry to be so unfocused on it . These men came into the restaurant and dragged this guy out . It looked like one of those Robert Longo paintings . And everyone just went right back to their meals like ... Like it was all staged or something . Like ... Like it was nothing . You felt vulnerable ? No . I identified with the men . I was rooting for the attackers . Come here , you . I had the dream again last night . - With the rhinoceros . - Tell anyone ? Not even your dad ? You 're not afraid , are you , darling monkey ? If you 're afraid of the rhino , the dream goes away . And then you 'll be like everybody else . And that 's the most terrible thing in the world . I really like this . Me too . You know , maybe Josie can keep the kids . I 'm just talking about a year or two . - She 'd love it . - Yeah . Harry ? Have you noticed anything about Coty ? You mean the facial paralysis ? Well , he 's just ... He seems distant . He 's closer to Mother than he is to me . Well , that 's normal . Yeah , boys that age pull away . - Really . Yeah . - Is that true , Dr. Bettelheim ? Well , in the research I 've done in the last 10 years . No , it 's just something about the look on his face when I touch him . I 'm probably just being paranoid . I love that quality . That paranoidal edge . - Makes me feel so ... - Harry . I forgot to tell you . - What ? - Deirdre talked . - You 're kidding . - No , right before she left with Mom . How can you forget something like that , Grace ? I don 't know , I just did . Well , what did she say ? I went to kiss her , she looked at me and said , " Everything must go . " - Are you sure ? - It 's too freaky to make up , Harry . " Everything must go . " Tell me that you love me , Junie Moon . I love you , Junie Moon . Do you mean it ? I really mean it . Show me . You know her from Summer Solstice and Pentagon Dreaming . Ladies and gentlemen , a warm welcome for Tabba Schwarzkopf . I understand that you are very big ... Share in certain charities . What ... ? What is it ... ? It 's all right . I get mixed-up . There 's so many of these things . Honey . He makes words up . Don 't you ? - Don 't wanna run , yet I heard ... - Oh , yes , please do . - Just for legal reasons , you know . - All right . Grace . Grace . God . Oh , God . Harry . - Harry . - What 's happening to me ? Come here . Come here . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm having these nightmares . I keep dreaming of this rhinoceros . Go on . It 's not like a dream at all . It 's not even close . I walk into this room and there it is . This rhinoceros . As real as this , Tommy . What does your shrink say , what 's-his-name ? Schenkl . He says I 'm about to learn some very important childhood stuff . I 'm having some sort of breakthrough . Yeah . A nervous breakthrough . - Harry . - What ? - Over there . Over there , turn slowly . - What ? See it ? - Where ? - There , beside the StairMaster . No . The girl ? A rhino . - I knew I shouldn 't have mentioned it . - Come on , you gotta joke about it . You don 't joke about it , you 'll wake up at a watering hole next to a gazelle . I 'll see you . - You free tonight ? - What 's happening ? I 'm having a few people over . Try and come by about 9 : 00 . There 's some people you should meet . Take it easy , Tommy . And bring Grace . Hi . I 'm ... I 'm Dr. West . - I 'm Grace , Coty 's mother . - I gathered that . May we talk for a few moments ? In my office ? Sure . Right this way . We met at open house . - You have a little girl , right ? - Yes , Deirdre . Can you tell me what 's happened ? Coty had a fight with one of the boys . Now , it 's nothing serious but it 's our policy to send the kids home when they act out physically . Give them a chance to cool off and , you know ... - ... think about what they did . - He 's never been in a fight before . - Over what ? - The class was making family trees you know , tracing history , and one of the boys started teasing him . What 's wrong with this picture ? He 's left me off . How did you find your way into recovery , Joey ? Well , I went to a Synthiotics house , which , to me ... - ... was a tremendous help . - Yes . I 'm investigating a missing child . Computers are down . Is there any way I could look through these stacks ? - Are you an attorney ? - Yes . - Oh , great . - They do fabulous work . So , what was your story ? Well , I was over their house for six months ... Fill this out . - Name again ? - Harry Wyckoff . I meant the name of the missing party . Peter Katz . These are the children K through Z. They only go back 15 years . Josie ? Paige . Harry . What are you doing here ? - Were you just with Josie ? - Josie ? - My mother-in-law . - Your mother-in-law . Yeah , the lady with the red scarf . But , Harry , I 'm late . I 'm sorry . Well , I wanted to talk to you about your kid . I was just down at the Justice Department . - Can 't believe how many are missing . - We 'll talk later . - Sure . - Why don 't you come with me . - No , I ... - No , this is not to be missed . Now technology for cheap reality is here and the Wild Palms Group is in the eye of the post-symbolic storm . Ladies and gentlemen , it is my great honor through the joint effort of our friends , partners and Kawasaki and Kansai , to introduce a visionary tomorrow 's realitician and today 's bridge between human wetware and high-end telepresence . Senator Tony Kreutzer . Thank you , thank you . And welcome . You know , I was in Tokyo just last week . And in Japan , they call me Fuji because I 'm white on top . To paraphrase Aristophanes I have all the traits of a popular politico : Bad breeding vulgar manner and one hell of a 10 . I 'm not here , children . I 'm a synthetic hologram . Talking to you , real time from the penthouse of this hotel . And one day very soon this is what it 's gonna look like right in the living room . You will costar in weekly sitcoms . You will fight the samurai 's battles and experience the heartbreak of first love . All between commercials . And if you own a TV , any old TV and an adaptor that you get from Mimecom for under a thousand dollars , then you have bought a ticket . I have seen the future . And it is Channel 3 . Where did he go ? That 's the guy you work for ? The guy who founded that freaky religion in the ' 60s ? Synthiotics . It 's helped a lot of people . New realism is very hip right now . I read about it in People . Don 't be so cynical . You should read some of his books . No , I don 't dig bad science fiction . - Bill . - Paige . Harry , this is William Gibson . Sure , Neuromancer . He coined the word " cyberspace . " And they won 't let me forget it . Nice to meet you , Bill . Paige Katz . - Quite a performance , senator . - Did you really think so ? Very Orson Welles . Very Mercury Theatre . Invaders From Mars . We 're taking the dog-and-pony show to FFC next week . - You think it 'll play ? - If they like Monopoly . Tony , I want you to meet a friend of mine , Harry Wyckoff . - How do you do ? - Hello . - Close friend ? - We went to school together . See the show , Harry ? Yes , it was mind-boggling . - What do you do , Harry ? - I 'm a lawyer . Armies of the night . My father owned a little clothing store in downtown L.A. - Did you know that , Harry ? - No , no , I didn 't . He started out a tailor . Yes , the Jews were the only tailors . My father was murdered by the Friends . They broke into his shop and they stole his things . They defecated in his shop and they beat this old man this maker of suits . They didn 't kill him . That came months later . He stayed alive long enough to have a fire sale . A fire sale in an inferno . Can you imagine it , Harry ? And I 'll never forget the sight of him . Death already in his eyes . Slumped on a chair beneath a great colorful banner : " Everything must go . " - What the hell was that all about ? - He 's bigger than life , huh ? Yeah . Scary like a Roman emperor . You know , the fingers . All he 's saying is that there 's more than one reality . That doesn 't make Synthiotics any different than , say , Buddhism . Our senator just bought Channel 3 . That 's some temple . Paige , can you tell me any more about your son ? Who the father was . Is . Relax , Harry , it isn 't you . I wasn 't implying that . Is there something between you and the senator ? No . - Was there ? - Well , maybe flirtation during the early campaign . We shared a lot of small planes together but it never went beyond that . Takes 16 months for one of them to make a baby . Can you imagine ? Of course you can 't . I only had Peter for nine . I can 't , Paige . - I can 't . - You can 't blame a girl for trying . It 's just ... It 's Grace . I know . It 's okay . Do you know what the Buddhists say ? There 's more than one reality . " Everything must go . " Did you really say that , Little Buddha ? You can tell your dad , come on . - " Everything must go . " - Harry , come on , we 'll be late . I must go . Close your eyes . Nighty-night , sleep monster . We 'll be back by midnight . You have your talk with Coty ? More like a monologue . Mine . Everybody reads too much into it . He 's just bored . He 's way ahead of his class . Yeah , I guess . I thought I saw your mom today . - She 's in Palm Springs . - I know . I thought I saw her in this car . I even followed it . - Where 'd it go ? - Over a cliff . - Yeah , you wish . - Yeah . - Yeah , it went to a hotel . - Did she have a big horn ? I 'm sorry . Is it any better ? - Is what ? - You know , the problem . Well , you have to be a little more specific , honey there 's a lot going on : nightmares , impotence , trouble with the kids ... - ... they 're saying weird things . - I 'm sorry I asked . Got a bloody nose playing racquetball at the law firm . - Knock it off . - Your lipstick 's on crooked . - My lipstick is not on crooked . - It 's all over your face . - It is not . - Like Ladykillers with Rod Steiger . - No rhino cracks , okay ? - Only if you behave . - That Rod Steiger down there ? - What ? Hey there . - Oh , my ... What are you doing here ? - Using the bathroom , what else ? - I forgot your name . - Oh , Grace . You were hilarious . I was gonna call you . - This is my husband , Harry . - How do you do ? - Your wife is fantastic . - Thank you . Mr. Wyckoff Goes to Washington . - Wasn 't that a movie ? - Maybe in your mind it was . This is my consort , Tully Woiwode . How do you do ? I 'm a big fan of yours . Made me get one of your paintings in the atrium at our firm . Watchers Born of the Night triptych ? The morning cometh and also the night the dog is turned to his own vomit . - That 's disgusting . - Babylon has fallen . Tommy , we didn 't know that you knew these guys . - Forever . - Well , he 's been hoarding you . - Well , I 'm hungry . Where 's the food ? - First there 's booze . Nobody eats until they 're smashed . Gotta clean those palates . I got a palate so clean I could eat off it . Somebody take him , he needs food . ~ I 'm just wild about Harry ~ ~ And Harry 's wild about me ~ ~ He 's as sweet as coffee and tea ~ He 's something . - Happy guy , huh ? - Maybe a little too happy . Yeah . You know , I think you 're just terrific . What was that thing you were in ... - ... with Gary Bravo ? - All Fall Down . That was terrific . That was really good . You were great in that . My son 's an actor . Are you working on something now ? - Something for Channel 3 . - Channel 3 . Come on , we 're dancing . So , what 'd you think of Tully Woiwode ? That guy is freaky , isn 't he ? Jeez . - He 's still painting ? - Yeah , he 's a factory . The Schnabel of the West Coast , even does restaurant menus . Know what they call him ? The Merchant of Venice . Cold , Tommy , really cold . - Such a cynic . - Hey , look at the food you got spread out here . Hey . You know who that woman is behind us , the one with the glasses ? Maisie Woiwode . That was the woman at the restaurant . You mean , you know her ? Tommy . Get your ass over here . Tommy ? Excuse me , ma 'am . I was at City when those guys grabbed your friend . Is he all right ? - You 're mixing me up with someone . - Is he okay ? It 's a mistake . - Wyckoff . - Yes . - Have you met my sister ? - Yes . Too bad you 're married . We 're trying to find Maisie a suitable candidate for breeding . - Hello , Harry . - Severin . Joe couldn 't make it . He 's still fly-fishing in some dark , secret location . Well , as long as he brings back a fish story , huh ? - That , he will . - Yeah . Joe Baum could bring back a fish story from the Gobi . He 's something . A woman came to see you . Paige Katz . - An old friend . - Did you know Miss Katz worked ... - ... for the Wild Palms Group ? - She may have mentioned it . You also know that we 're preparing a suit against Mimecom on behalf of the Deke Newhouse Company . I 'm not involved with that , but I 'm familiar with it . It seems someone from Newhouse found out Miss Katz was visiting our offices . She came to me because of a personal problem . I wasn 't accusing you or your friend of being a mole , Harry . That 's comforting . Deke Newhouse is concerned enough to threaten to go elsewhere . This account means a lot to us , as you know . It would be impolitic for us to give you a full partnership just now . The timing is not good . Come on , Severin , that 's absurd . I mean , Paige Katz was in trouble . - Her son disappeared . - When was the last time you saw her ? A while ago , 15 years maybe . A woman who disappeared 15 years ago , hasn 't been in your life for 15 years , and she comes to a patent attorney to help him find her son . How does it sound ? Look , I don 't care how it sounds , Severin . Why do I feel , all of a sudden , I 'm in a courtroom ? - There 's no need . - I want that partnership . You owe me , Severin . We 're going to make Morty Winnaker a limited partner . - Morty Winnaker ? - When things cool down at Newhouse , we 'll take you aboard with open arms . But Winnaker ? Let things settle , Harry . Yeah , I 'll let it settle , all right . They can just settle without me . - You 're being foolish . - See you . Good luck , sick little punk . - Hello . - Hello . Go say hi to your mom . Hey , darling . What you got cooking there ? Pork chops , baby . I 'm king of Pork Chop Hill . Coty , tell Daddy what happened today . - What ? - Come on . He 's just a cool customer . What happened , Coty ? Kill someone at school ? Coty . I 'm gonna be on TV . Tabba 's new show , Church Windows . - When did that happen ? - You had lunch . Said they 're looking for a 12-year-old kid . Told her about Coty . She said , " Bring him in . " Quiet . Does he even wanna do it ? Oh , it 's torture for him . Of course he wants to . - I 'll get it . - Didn 't even notice my apron . Oh , it 's almost erotic . Well , I 'm gonna be a househusband for a while . - Just call me Yoko . - Dad , it 's a woman ! - Paige . - Hello , Harry . What are you doing here ? This is Paige Katz , a friend ... - ... and a client . - Hello . Sorry to burst in on you like this . We were just sitting down to ... - No , that 's all right . - It won 't take any more than a minute . Could I ... ? I had to see you talk to you . Paige , I think you should find someone else to follow up on your son . I don 't think , you know , this is such a great idea . I called your office , they said you 'd taken leave . Harry ... A friend of mine had a dream about you . He wants you to come and meet him at Rancho Mirage . The senator ? He wanted me to give you this . When I was a boy , I ran away from home . I took a bus to Palm Springs . - Oh , I like that . - Yeah . Running away to the desert . The wind is old and still at play While I must hurry upon my way For I am running to Paradise That 's Yeats . Harry . You 're gonna make me fall in love with you . We live in a desert , that 's the earth . We inherited it . No sense complaining . Some of us would like to see the garden again . The drawing Paige gave me ... I 've had some nightmares . Harry , do you know what the rhino is ? It 's all that 's left of the unicorn . A magnificent activism . The remnant of ecstatic myth , rough , nearly blind . Utterly exquisite . I 'll bet you think I 'm a tweaked old bastard , don 't you ? Maybe . Harry ... How would you like to work for me ? Doing what ? Oh , I don 't know , we 'll find something , household chores maybe . We could always use another masseur . - Well ... - Or ... How about head of Business Affairs at Channel 3 at five times your old salary ? How was it ? Oh , it was pretty amazing . His house is the size of a country club . You the spokesman for Synthiotics now ? Not quite . But he did ask me to work for him . You gonna do it ? It 's a lot of money . I don 't know , I 've gotta figure out what I 'm getting myself into . Drink ? Why didn 't you tell me about her ? Paige ? I don 't know . Happened so long ago , I ... Maybe I should have . Were you still seeing her when we first met ? Don 't lie to me , Harry . No . - It was over a few months before . - Is it over now ? Yes . Got you on the rebound , huh ? You 're the best thing that 's ever happened to me , Grace . I used to think so . I have a headache . I 'm gonna take a nap . - I love you . - Love you too . We 're all filled with giant love bugs . I didn 't go looking for Paige Katz . She came looking for me . You can understand why Grace was a little rattled . Okay , Mr. Understanding , cool it , huh ? Can we get off this ? - Where are we going to eat ? - Someplace on the beach . ~ I love you , baby And if it 's quite all right ~ ~ I need you , baby ~ Harry . Harry . Harry . You don 't like my singing ? - You been looking into missing kids ? - Yeah . Remember all those kidnappings during the ' 90s ? It was a secret recruitment program for the Fathers . Fathers ? What are you talking about ? Satanists ? Too political for you , Harry ? I 'm listening . Let me give you a little background history . We 're talking two groups , political enemies . The Fathers and the Friends . The Friends were libertarians . Obsessed with the Bill of Rights . - What 's it got to do with missing kids ? - I 'm getting to that . Tommy , what are we doing here ? You always wanted a beach house . Well , I found you one . I thought we were going out to dinner . I 'm starving . Somebody inside I want you to meet . Who ? Brian Wilson and his shrink ? Hey , Chickie . I brought a friend . Nice to see you . Make yourselves at home . This is Harry Wyckoff . Would you care to join me ? I 'm in the ballroom . Why don 't you pick out some eyeglasses for you and your friend . Beautiful . Ought to sell these at the store , Harry . Harry , you might feel a little nauseous at first . All right . Are you all right ? Is it better now ? What 's happening ? It 's all computer-generated . We 're in cyberspace . They call it the Web , just go with it . - Is this real ? - Or is it Mimecom ? I thought ... Wasn 't he in a wheelchair ? Couldn 't walk , could he ? Didn 't you give your little speech , Thomas , Poli-Sci 101 ? See ? It 's been 20 years since they broke my back and left me for dead . I had to lay under my mother 's body very still , and I 'll tell you why . Because after they killed her they sat down at the table and had dinner . Ate everything she 'd cooked just hours before . Even today I can still feel the weight of her . Tara ! This is Tara . She comes to us all the way from Kyoto . She 's plugged into a computer just like we are , only she 's in Japan . See , both parties are able to meet in the Web . Thomas , try and be a little poetic . - Do you want me to come back ? - No . No . Stay . Stay . They were just leaving . I call her Tara Infirma . It 's a bad joke . Gentlemen , put your glasses down anywhere . It was nice of you to drop by . Harry it was nice to meet you . Bye , now . Too weird . That Web . It was so real . I mean , I 've played around with virtual-reality toys before , but this ... Yeah , the senator wants Chickie to work for him . He needs him . See , Chickie is the Einstein of the New World . The senator 's more like P.T. Barnum , you know . He must bring that ballroom over the phone lines right into the living rooms of America . That 's what Church Windows is all about . I want Chickie Levitt brought in . And I want Woiwode to do it . A jewel in the saddle of an ass . What is it about you and Woiwode ? You 're worse than a Punch and Judy show . At least we know who Judy is . He betrays you with every breath . - He is a fair painter . - He 's a whore ! And you 're his biggest john . Someone should set him on fire . You 're too hard on him . He saved my life . And he 'll take it away . I would have drowned . Don 't talk to me about that fateful day in Catalina . He almost drowned you just so he could pluck you out of the water and get a medal . He wanted you forever in his debt . Woiwode knows just how soft you are . How soft am I ? You 've got the skin of a kid , you know that ? How old is Jack Nicholson now ? Gotta be close to 80 . God , that movie really depressed me . - The Indian got away , didn 't he ? - Oh , terrific . Wanna have some dinner somewhere ? You kidding ? I OD 'd on that popcorn of yours . I think I 'll just go home . - Where 's Tommy ? - Out with Harry Wyckoff . - Jealous ? - Tearing my hair out . You know I really enjoy these film-festival nights of ours . Brothers and sisters share the sweetest mysteries . Mystery loves company . ~ I love you , baby And if it 's quite all right ~ Please don 't sing , Harry . ~ I need you , baby ... ~ - Harry , come on . - You don 't like my voice ? - I have a headache . You mean a hangover . ~ You 're just like heaven to touch ~ ~ I wanna hold you so much ~ - Aren 't we excited ? Nervous ? - Who , me ? - First day of school and all . - No way . Would you check on Coty ? He 's got a read-through at the studio . Yeah . You going to the store today ? Jeez . I don 't think you 've left this room for five days . I told you , I 'm not feeling well . It 's because you 're drinking all day and at night you 're standing out on the balcony watching the damn palms . - You should talk to my shrink . - I don 't wanna talk to your shrink .

It 's like the sweat of a sink . Pass me some of that ... What is that , pumpernickel ? I didn 't do well during the Depression . I had some crappy years like everyone . Got in some trouble , robbed a bank . Bank ? - This was when ? - Six , seven years ago . You remember how bad it got ? - They catch you ? - Oh , yeah , I went to prison . Jeez , Gavin . Jail gave me time to think . I know , it 's a clich√© . In my worst moments I got handed a book on Synthiotics . - On the Way to the Garden . - You got it . Yeah , the world 's a smoke-filled room , Harry . We die in the aisles looking for the exit . The senator shows us the way . Hey , look at that . It 's the funniest thing I ever seen . Okay , this is funny . - Get off of there . - Hey , killer . What 's happening ? - Where 's your mom ? - She 's upstairs . - Where are we ? - I wish I knew , Frankie .

They loved me . Thanks for asking . I 'm going away this weekend to the desert . What 's in the desert ? A friend . Someone who knew my stepfather . He 's at the prison hospital in Indian Wells . The resort ? What 's he doing in there ? It 's political . Political . I never told you about him . He 's an old friend of the family from Kyoto . He founded a group . Like a band ? They 're part of the underground . They call themselves " the Friends . " How is Chickie Levitt ? Tully took him at the beach . - Has he talked ? - He will . You really inspire confidence . Has he mentioned the Go-chip ? Don 't snipe at me . It 's only been a few weeks . We are the cardinals of this cathedral . This broken boy is to us a stained glass . He is the freaking Church Windows . There is no escape without him . I think he 'll talk to a man . Someone the same age his father was when he was taken . What about Chap Starfall ? I haven 't heard that name in a thousand years . I talked to him a few months ago . He 's going to be in town on a gig . ~ Kings don 't mean a thing ~ ~ On the street of dream ~ - Used to love the way he did that . - He was a handsome boy . Good pipes on him . Used to live out of garbage cans at Zuma . He is a die-hard New Realist , clean and sober a long time now . And he still does the occasional benefit for us . Chap Starfall . Go and see him , Paige . Pull him in . Show him the wild blue sky . Good evening , ma 'am . How are you feeling ? Hungry ? Did you eat enough ? We never meant to kill your mother . What 's done is done . I loved your father so . What is it ? Oh , yeah . - Hey , this place ain 't so bad . - Harry , would you stop . No wonder they call it a resort . - Don 't joke about it . - I 'm gonna give my travel agent a call . Maybe they 've got weekend-getaway rates for couples . Mrs. Wyckoff ? Our guest is ready to see you now . - Back in a minute . - Okay . You are free to roam the grounds . We do ask that visitors to wear their badges and respect the posted signs denoting restricted areas . Hello , Grace . Hello . - How are you ? - I 'm all right . Every once in a while when Mother looks at me in a certain way I know she 's seeing you . Did you bring Harry ? I told him you were a friend of the family . I 'm so sorry I never visited . Forgive me for leaving you alone in that country with that demonic woman . It 's my one , my only regret . I 've lived with it every day for over 20 years . Daddy ... I 'm so sorry . Harry ? Hey , doc . - You better just be visiting . - No , no . Finally went over the edge . - Well , win some , lose some . - You 're talking about minds , right ? - You haven 't been in . - Things have been going too well . No time for neurosis . But I 'm gonna try to pencil some in . Well , that 's terrific , Harry . I 'm happy for you . Thanks . So ... Grace is visiting an old college friend . An alcoholic . What 's your excuse ? - Consulting staff . - Oh , yeah . I know the Fathers have done terrible things . I know that they 've taken children from political enemies . I know they 've harvested children . What I need to know is Coty ... What is it ? Would they have taken my baby and given me the son of another ? Could they have done that ? Answer me , Father . I will come for you . I will come for you all . And you will help me , Harry Wyckoff . That 's why you were born . - Mom ? - In here , honey . I couldn 't sleep . Oh , poor baby . Let me fix you some warm milk . With a shot of Kahlua ? Come here , you . It 's a new city , it 's a new school , it 's gonna take some getting used to . Mom , are you ever gonna get married again ? Oh , I don 't know , Ivan . Is it because you 're still in love with Dad ? Maybe it 's difficult to meet someone as wonderful as your father was . Is it because Dad was a man of God ? Not just that . Hey , Mom . How about that real-estate guy ? You know , the one who sold us the house . He was a little crude . Called me a fixer-upper . At least you weren 't a tear-down . Come in , Harry , come in . - How are you ? - I 'll tell you how I am . Mucus strangled . Toxic . - What happened ? - Injunction . The networks wanna stop Church Windows . WPN has a technological monopoly , blah , blah , blah . You 're damn straight we do , I spent billions earning it . You recognize the letterhead ? Baum , Weiss and Latimer , your old pals . Thirty years , Harry . I labored 30 years ! Now they wanna shake the trees , grab all the apples . You 're the patent attorney . What are you gonna do about it ? Well ... They 're invoking the " Paramount Consent Decree . " - What is it ? - The governments forced the studios to sell off the movie theaters , that was in the ' 40s . " Unlawful , Mimecom 's unilateral refusal of deal ... " Mimecom owns the patents ! And I own Mimecom . They 're trying to rape me , Harry . It 's that flipping simple . I 'll take care of it . - Jacob . - Yes , Mr. Wyckoff . Arrange a meeting between myself and the networks who filed suit and I want it within 24 hours . - Shall I inform the senator 's office ? - No . Empress . Why , oh , why didn 't I ever draw a portrait of you ? Because I won 't allow it . You know I don 't approve of likenesses photographic or otherwise . A waste . You 're such icon material . Tell me what you want , Tully , and then get out . Give her back to me , Josie . If she 's still alive . What are you talking about ? I hear things . I cover the waterfront , remember ? You cover your ass . You know what ? You make me vomit . How dare you come into my home and dictate to me . This is a you that we don 't get to see enough of . There 's a temple in Toshiba Park , guarded by a pale , blue-skinned Shoki . And the eyes bug out , just like yours . I don 't want to play anymore . Can you please get that through your head ? You dried-up monster . Without Maisie , I am not interested in living . Are you interested in dying ? Give her back to me . Or I will send you to a hell you 're not familiar with . Hello . When did you get back ? Now ? It 's almost 11 : 00 . Yeah , yeah , I know where that is . ... talking with Oliver Stone . Fifteen years after the film JFK , the files are released . You were right . Are you bitter ? No , no , I 'm not bitter , Joe . If Jack Valenti were alive , I think I 'd be the first one to extend an olive branch to this guy . That was fast . Thanks . You get my phone messages ? They were sweet . - So where you been ? - Kyoto . - I thought I told you . - No , nobody tells me anything . Thank you . I missed you . - How 's the new job ? - Oh , it 's incredible . I keep pinching myself . Can I help with that ? - That was wonderful . - Well , thank you . - Really enjoyed that . - Well , we like it , we 're having fun . We call it the saloon tour , no amphitheaters or arenas . Chap , this is Harry Wyckoff . Harry 's the new head of Business Affairs at WPN . I 've seen the ads on Church Windows . Wild . It 's gonna change the ball game . I mean the way we perceive . That 's been the senator 's game plan all along . Chap 's a long-time Synthiotics head . - Before it was chic . - The wheel comes round . Here 's to old love songs and New Realism . I wanted to talk to you about your kid . I found out some very strange information . I 've got some good people handling that now , Harry . - I should have left you out of it . - No , listen . - Have you heard of the Fathers ? - To do with the government ? - Well , remember Tommy Lazlo ? - Yes , your crazy friend from college . Well , he told me this thing about stolen children about some kind of recruitment program . Anybody ever mention that to you ? - Anyone that 's looking for your kid ? - Recruitment , for what ? I don 't know . He 's probably just paranoid . - You know he loves a conspiracy . - Don 't we all . Well ... - ... I 'd better get home . - You sure ? Not really . Goodnight , Paige . Goodnight , Harry . Dream carefully . I looked in the toilet and screamed . That 's a great title . I 'm gonna call my memoirs that . - Honey , what are you talking about ? - Your friends from yoga class . - Yeah , I told you about those people . - Your wife has been baring all . Don 't say anything that 'll get us into trouble . - What was her name , Gavin ? - Sawran . As in " wrap . " We 'd been hearing the sexual stuff for years . - You know , the five-day orgasm . - Five days ? That 's gotta take some serious foreplay . It all happens without physical contact . They take this pill they get illegally from the farm . P - H-A-R-M . Wait , what does this have to do with the screaming toilet ? Would you please let her finish ? This pill they give you turns the water , you know ... What Eileen 's trying to say so discreetly is , you pee purple . - You took it ? - We most certainly did . I can 't take the suspense , what happened ? Nothing . They failed to inform us the first time you take it ... - ... there 's a delayed response . - So , four days later Eileen 's in the dentist 's chair . Oh , come on . It 's a gamble , Harry . I mean , it could blow up in your face . Don 't you think you ought to run it by him first ? Well , it 's too late . Besides , I 'm running it by you . Well , I appreciate that . For some reason , I don 't know why , I trust you . - Well , I 've only got one question . - What 's that ? What are you gonna do when the senator fires your ass ? Rob a bank . Got any tips ? Sorry we didn 't call . I know how much I hate it when someone drops by unannounced . Your work is greatly improved . What a wonderful likeness of your sister . You know if you went to the desert and dug Maisie up you 'd find the resemblance remarkable . You 've captured that tortured look she had the last eight or nine hours of the interrogation . Artists have their great periods . Picasso had his blue . Now Tully Woiwode will have his blind . My eyes ! The bitch took my eyes ! - My love to Grace and the kids . - Thank you very much , Severin . - And Morty , hey . - Yeah . - Thank you for your help today . - Yeah . By the way , next time you go to the dry cleaners ask them to put the stain stickers on your sleeve . - That 's how you get that schmutz out ... - Thanks . Thanks , Harry . - Thank you . - How did it go ? They went for it , had to . - I love it . - What a big genius you are . - When are you gonna tell the old man ? - I 'm heading down to the desert now . - You know it 's his birthday ? - How 's his mood ? Good . Upbeat , vengeful . Come on with me . We gotta go to the media room . - They 've set up the Windows demo . - Now ? You won 't believe it . How many adaptors have we sold ? Well , RadioShack 's done about 20 million units . The response has been phenomenal . I had this unbelievable experience down at the beach . I put these glasses on , I saw this ballroom . We got rid of the glasses . Too many glitches . We 'll use them for total-immersion custom stuff . Most people couldn 't afford them anyway . - Tell me about the box . - This is the adaptor , just like cable only it 's a computer that generates synthetic holograms . Now , the TV scans the room . Infrared knows where you 're sitting . Knows where the chairs are . Knows where the sofa is . There 's even a collision detector , optional . - Cool . - All right , fellas . All right . - Mom ? - In here , honey . I couldn 't sleep . Poor baby . Let me fix you some warm milk . With a shot of Kahlua ? Could you lower the volume ? It 's a new city , it 's a new school , it 's gonna take some getting used to . - Collision detector . - Mom are you ever gonna get married again ? I don 't know , Ivan . Is it because you 're still in love with Dad ? Too weird . Well , maybe because it 's difficult to meet anyone as wonderful as your father was . Or is it because he was a man of God ? Not just that . Hey , Mom . How about that real-estate broker ? You know , the one who sold you the house . He was a little crude . Called me a fixer-upper . At least you weren 't a tear-down . You wanna go interactive ? It 's a new program . Be ready in about a year . Go ahead , touch her . - You sure ? - Yeah . Try again , Mr. Wyckoff . Poor baby . Let me fix you some warm milk . Poor baby , poor baby , poor baby . Poor baby , poor baby , poor baby . Grace ? There you are . Criminy , I cannot climb stairs anymore . You sick ? What is that ? A black hole . Thought you 'd recognize it . Lovely . - I went to see Daddy . - Really ? Is he well ? Tell me about the Fathers , Mother . Tell me what you know about the abduction of children . It was a way to strike at men who wanted to burn the fabric of our country , of our world . If the children of our enemies could join us and turn against their own , this would be a great gift . That was the thinking anyway . How far did it go , Mother ? I don 't think I know what you mean . Who decided ? Who decided which children would be taken ? - I already told you . - Was it you and the senator ? We didn 't sanction any of it . Liar ! I just wanna know one thing . Who is that little boy ? The one I 've called my own ? - You 're insane . Just like Eli Levitt . - Who is he , Mother ? You tell me . I wanna know . And I wanna know what they did to my baby . I 'm either too hot or too cold all the damn time . - Happy birthday . - Get me something good ? I talked to the networks today . I got you a deal . I don 't think I heard you right . I settled the suit . I think you 're gonna be ... You son of a bitch ! You can 't deal with those half-heads behind my back ! Listen to me . You 've been preparing for this moment for 40 years . Forty years a visionary . Now act like one . - You 've got to sell the technology . - I told you never . Can 't you see they 're gonna get it anyway ? This isn 't some recipe for chili . It 's only a matter of time before someone does it and does it better . Let them have it . This way at least you retain some control . You made a deal ? In 10 months time we will agree to license to them the technology for which we will receive a royalty beyond imagination . By then it won 't matter if there 's a thousand networks . There 'll only be Channel 3 in the eyes of the world . Behind my back ! Yes ! Chap , what did they do with my things ? They 're safe . Everything was moved here . It 's all here now . They want me to tell them secrets . They wanna know about the Go-chip . You know what Synthiotics calls the last secret ? That there are no secrets anymore . The senator wants to be immortal . Could anyone be more deserving ? There 's somebody I need to talk to . Who 's that ? A girl . Her name is Tara . I saw Church Windows today . It 's only the beginning . Why should this reality be public domain ? What 's so great about it ? Tony wants a new , improved reality controlled by Mimecom and sold straight out of 7-Eleven . I 'm glad I found you again . It 's all there for the taking . A world where we don 't have to be afraid to leave our dreams open at night . With you I feel there aren 't any limits . They found the man who took my son . Where ? They 're bringing him in . They want me to go there to identify him . I 'm scared , Harry . Will you be there ? - Will you be there with me ? - If you want me to . I want you . - I need you . - I 'll be there . You 'll come ? - I 'll come with you , Paige . - Come with me , Harry . The palm at the end of the mind , beyond the last thought rises in the bronze d√©cor . - I can 't believe we 're chasing this guy . - We 're gonna nail him . - Are they the police ? - No they 're special units called Watchers . Come on . - Come on . - Wait a minute . Paige ! - Paige , what are we doing ? - Take him . What do you mean take him , take him where ? Don 't let him get away , Harry , not now . Please , Harry . Don 't you care ? Please , Harry . Oh , God , no . Tommy ! This is how it begins .

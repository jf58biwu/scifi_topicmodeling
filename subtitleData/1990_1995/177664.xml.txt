If you do that at the Metropolitan Museum ball tomorrow night , they 'll throw us off the dance floor . Sorry , the music sent me away . - [ clang ] - Reed ? What was that noise ? The beating of my heart , you wild thing . - [ clang ] - Ben , Johnny , hear something ? Breathe easy . Grasp your foot and relax . Think positive thoughts . [ groans ] " Breathe easy . " Yeah , sure . - [ Sue ] Ben ! - Huh ? What you say , Susie ? I said , did you and Johnny hear anything up on the roof ? I didn 't hear nothing . - Hey , hot rod ! - [ rock music ] Did you hear anything ? The twerp didn 't hear nothing , either . [ man ] Lower exits armed . Robots , move forward to your missión . Commence projection of energy grid . Interweave containment cage . Breathe , relax . Breathe ... Relax ... Breathe ... Now initiate diversión . Hey , why 'd you mess up my cards ? I didn 't do nothing . Now , would you bug off ? I 'm trying to relax here ! Hey ! You lay off my Wayne Newton records . I didn 't touch ' em . And you trashed my Fleer 's Marvel cards . - Did not . - Did too . Flame on ! Stand still and get clobbered , you fink firefly . Have a hot foot , hothead ! Yes . Proceed when ready . Ya ! Oh ! You come back here , you ... ! - [ rumbling ] - What on earth ... ? I told you I heard something . Johnny and Ben must be at it again . Please make them behave . They listen to you . I 'll be back soon for my rumba . Olé ! Oh , Reed ! What is it ? Reed ! Reed ! Complete your missión , my children . - Reed ! - Oh ! Come back here . Come to Papa . He can ... Oh ! Hey , hey ! Stop that . Now , both of you ! - Tell it to him . He started it . - Ah , sheep dip ! He messed up my Wayne Newton collection . Now , wait a minute . We 're supposed to be a team . How can we fight the enemies of mankind if you 're always fighting each other , instead ? What the hey ? This keeps us in practice . Yeah ? Who appointed you class monitor ? Look , I don 't care what you do but you 're bothering Sue . So knock it off ! Excellent ! Complete the energy cage . - Wow ! - Wow ! Looks like a bomb hit the joint . Where 's Sue ? Sue ! Susan Storm is my prisoner . - Who said that ? - It 's coming from outside . If you wish her to remain unharmed , you must follow my orders . What ? These ropes , they 're solidified strands of energy . Well , let me unsolidify it . Fools ! It is useless to resist . Hmm , that voice . It 's been years , but ... Von Doom ? Is it you ? Victor Von Doom ? Yes , Reed Richards . You see the rumors of my death were without substance . Ugh ! Show your face , pal , 'cause I got a knuckle sandwich with your name on it . Spare me your histrionics . You have no choice but to obey me . Step into the light and join us . - Quickly ! - A tractor beam ? Sue 's life is at stake . Follow my lead . Take it easy . Robots , welcome my guests and secure them at once . Call off the artillery . We 're not going anywhere . No , my young friend . You are ! Relax . And enjoy the ride . You are guests of Doctor Doom . Welcome . Your ... rooms are ready . You won 't get me like that . For The Thing , a vibranium-steel apartment . You might be able to batter your way out . In a few thousand years . [ Doom laughs ] Let 's see how well the Human Torch can burn . Under water . Now we come to Mr. Fantastic . How can we hold such a clever fellow ? Mr. Fantastic can make himself whatever shape he wants . What better than a prison that can do the same ? How fantastic do your friends seem now , Susan ? Fantastic enough to defeat you in the end . - This isn 't over yet . - Doombots ! Be gone ! You shall be my guest for dinner . And at sunrise , I will give you a missión to perform for me . And you will do it willingly . Or you will all die . Sue , Johnny , Ben . - Can you read me ? - Yes , I hear you , darling . I got you , too , Reed . Ben , can you hear me ? Ben , please acknowledge . Yeah , I hid your intercom in my gum , Stretcho . You 're coming through loud and chewy . The prisons Doctor Doom prepared for us are clever , but together , I know we can find a way out ... Shh ! Someone 's coming . It 's Doom 's servant , Hauptmann . Doctor Doom requests the honor of your presence at dinner , Mrs. Richards . [ Thing ] You tell him to get lost , Susie . Silence , you brainless oaf ! It is useless to struggle . Ach , du lieber ... Must release controls . Can 't quite reach . There . [ Reed ] Sue , now ! Free Johnny . Hurry , sis , get me free and I 'll melt Reed loose . - Alarm ! Prisoners escaping ! - [ alarm ] Oh , you got that right , Mr. Wiener Schnitzel ! Agh ! Put me down ! It 's no use . I 'm free but I can 't get the rest of us out . - What should I do ? - Have dinner with Doom . - What ? - I know it 's a lot to ask . But my guess is he needs to wait out the blizzard before he can send us on his missión . [ Reed ] The longer we keep him talking , the more time we have to figure a way out of here so we can save you . Save all of us . I 'll do my best , sweetheart , but I won 't breathe easy until I know you 're safe . Well , Hauptmann , I wondered what was ... holding you up . [ Thing ] Very funny . Har-dee-har-har . He tricked me , Excellency . It was not my fault . It is of no consequence . I think our guests will behave themselves . At least while Mrs. Richards is at my table . Won 't you join me , my dear ? Perhaps Mrs. Richards would like to freshen up before dinner . Hauptmann , see to it . If you try to escape again , your wife will pay the penalty . I bid you good evening . The clock is ticking . Johnny . Ben . We 've got to get loose before the snow storm blows over . Or none of us may survive . [ thunder ] [ Doom thinks ] Sue Richards is beautiful . But will her loyalty to her husband withstand this trial ? I wonder what she truly thinks of me . I am powerful and once I was also handsome . [ screams ] What do externals matter ? It is the man within who counts . My life here is rather isolated . I am pleased you accepted my invitation . I had no choice . But I wouldn 't have missed it for the world . I find you fascinating . You do ? Hauptmann , clean up ! I have made an unfortunate mess . As you were saying . You find me fascinating ? It 's the man behind the mask that intrigues me . I want to know more about you ... All about you . Now you have succeeded in fascinating me , Mrs. Richards . To your health , my charming Susan . Ah ! An excellent vintage . And my story begins many years ago , in a gypsy camp , not far from the vineyards below this castle . My father , Rudolph , was a most important man . A respected healer . There was nothing miraculous about his cures . Ancient knowledge passed down from generations . On many occasions he saved children who lay ill with dreaded fevers , the gratitude in their eyes the only reward he sought . But the simple people of the village believed he was a miracle worker . A sorcerer . While some revered him , others saw him as a target , a golden goose whose feathers they could pluck . They saw their opportunity . They were sure my father had no chance . With arrogant confidence , the villains ' cruelty was without bounds . But they did not know what type of man they chose that night . My father 's scientific skills had powerful manifestations . The robot spider served him well . As did a blinding flash from his illuminated buckle . The superstitious fools ! But this is too sad a story for such a cold evening . I should be silent and allow you to enjoy the meal . Oh , no , no , no , please . I want you to tell me everything . Yes ... Everything . Doom 's robots , I 've just deduced that they 've been programmed to understand English . They 're listening , so we 'll have to use another language . Yeah , that 'll be a cinch for you , Stretcho . As far as I can tell you , you ain 't ever talked English . Johnny , listen . Are-ay ou-yay earing-way the atch-way I - ay ave-gay ou-yay or-fay our-yay irthday-bay ? Pig Latin ! I-ay ean-may ig-pay Atin-lay . Sheesh ! Now I can 't understand neither one of them . Our-yay atch-way , ush-pay the imer-tay . Wow ! I mean , ow-way ! - What is it ? - A catalytic ignition system . I can understand the pig Latin better . A cutting torch that works underwater . [ Reed ] Hurry . Use your torch to cut your way out of the tank . Flame on ! [ Thing ] Ooh ! His temperature 's going up ! [ Thing laughs ] Way up ! The robots didn 't sound the alarm . Hurry , we 've got to find Sue ! Huh ? Hey , welcome to the funhouse . The fun isn 't gonna last long . Those aren 't mirrors ! They 're laser furnaces ! Agh ! Get back ! I 'm glad they ain 't mirrors . 'Cause I sure don 't need seven years ' bad luck . [ Reed ] A diabolical maze . I expected no less from Doctor Doom . One of these passageways must lead to the main castle . Yeah . One for the money , two for the show , we gotta save Susie , now , which way do we go ? I 'm well aware of the situation , Ben . We can 't take action without thinking first . So , think ! The wind is messing up my hairdo . That 's it ! That icy wind is from the storm outside . It 's strongest from the left . From the brief glimpse I caught of the castle 's juxtaposition with the mountain face , I deduce ... Yeah , yeah . You said left , we 're going left . If we wait around for you to stop yapping , we 'll be on Medicare before we get outta here . [ Thing ] So far , this looks pretty good . ¶ There 's Galactus looking hungry ¶ And ol ' Doctor Doom is near ¶ Here come the Skrulls invading ¶ Do you run and hide in fear ? ¶ No way , no way , no way ¶ Just call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four ¶ That 's all , no more Now , that 's grammatical ¶ Reed Richards is elastic ¶ Sue can fade from sight ¶ Johnny is the Human Torch ¶ The Thing just loves to fight ¶ Call for the Four ¶ Fantastic Four

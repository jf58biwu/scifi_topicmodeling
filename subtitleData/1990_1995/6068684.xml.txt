 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is ... Superboy . [ no audio ] [ music continues ] Yes ! That was the ranger from up in the national park . You know those calls that 's been coming in about a UFO ? - You mean the media . - Whatever it is . Some pilots think they spotted it in a remote wilderness area . - I 'm going there now . - Well , that 's great . I 'll come with you , if you need a help . You 'll stay here and answer the phone . Uh , Mr. Jackson , there 's someone here to see you . May I help you ? Yeah , I want you to get your investigative staff together . - What ? Who are you ? - Your superior . [ gasps ] You 're Joseph Flynn . - Welcome to our humble office . - Just do it . Uh , Lou , Alexis , Margaret , my office . Matt , you too . But I was just on my way out . Uh , what about these two ? They do investigative work sometimes . I said your investigative staff . Yes , of course , sorry . You two , my office . People , I would like to introduce you- - Sit down . I can tell them who I am . My name is Joseph Flynn , and this is my partner , Mr. Stuart . And we 're here from the head office . The reason we 're here is , someone in this room is hiding something which in time could prove to be a breach in national security . [ intense music ] Now , wait a minute . My people would never- - Your people ? I wouldn 't be so sure about that . Any administrator that would let a thing like this get past him needs to be replaced and I intend to do just that . Now , sit down . We already know which one of you it is . But , uh , we 're more interested in finding out where the rest of your allegiances lie . So for the next couple of days we 're going to be interviewing you individually . So I suggest you place your loyalties to one another aside . Because the person you 're sitting next to .. ... could be harboring a very dangerous secret . [ intense music ] What did you tell him ? You were in there over an hour . I didn 't even mention your name . Now , get off my back . Flynn 's only been here few hours and everybody 's totally paranoid . It 's almost as if there 's something in the air . Maybe it 's justified . Miss Lang . - Oh , Matt . - What ? - Did you take the UFO file ? - Listen , the ranger called . One of the search parties just found the object the pilot saw . And it 's definitely an alien craft . I knew it ! What else ? There were humanlike footprints leading away from it . And they 're tracking them ? Well , they can 't . The dogs can 't get a scent . - Why wouldn 't there be a scent ? - I don 't know . That 's weird . I wish I could get outta here and find out what 's happening . Yeah , I know what 's that like . I wonder what happened to that file . So you and your friend out there are interns ? - That 's correct . - Mm-hmm . College girl , huh ? I bet you 're getting quite a bit of experience for someone so young . Yeah , I-I 've learned a lot from Matt Ritter and Mr. Jackson . I wasn 't referring to your work . - What were you referring to ? - Oh , come now , Miss Lang . A young ... attractive woman , such as yourself .. What does that have to do with your investigation ? I just wanna know everything there is to know about you . You know all you 're gonna know unless you start acting like a professional . I know about your reputation . What reputation ? Well .. A lot of things come out in these interviews . I don 't believe you . Don 't play coy with me , Miss Lang . You see , I 've learned ... where there 's smoke , there 's fire . Don 't ever put your clammy hands on me again . [ indistinct chattering ] Are you okay ? Did you say something to Flynn about me ? No . Why ? Are you hiding something , Lana ? No . Are you ? Somebody is . What about you , Ritter ? You were in there an awfully long time . You spill your guts about the rest of us ? - Spill my guts ? - Hey , listen . [ all clamoring ] Things are progressing rather nicely . ( Matt ) I was there a long time trying not to say a word .. I think you 're pushing them a bit too hard . I don 't care what you think . I 'm the one in charge . How about you , Clark ? You 're always sneaking around . Yeah , disappearing for hours at a time . Taking long lunches . Where do you go ? Probably selling secrets to the Russians . Oh , no , you idiot . It 's the Japanese now . Wait a minute ! This isn 't like us . Something 's wrong . We 're friends . We 'll probably find out this whole thing was a big mistake . Or maybe they 'll find the one they 're looking for . And then we 'll all be on the news looking like those people that say .. ... " I worked with him for years . " I can 't imagine he 'd do anything like that . I for one , hope they nail him ... or her . Mr. Kent . [ intense music ] I bet you were wondering when I 'd get around to you . No . I figured my turn would come . Mm-hmm . I kept you till last until I found out what everyone else knew . About what ? Oh , you know . Question is , are you going to tell me or do I force you ? Maybe you could tell me what you 're looking for , so .. ... so I don 't waste your time . Oh , don 't worry about me . I have all the time in the world . This wouldn 't be about , uh ... Superboy ? What do you think ? Well , it 's just that it 's hard to believe that Superboy could be the cause for a breach in national security . How or why there is a problem is not your concern . You just tell me what you know . You better get out here . [ indistinct chattering ] What is going on here ? Margaret 's threatening to kill herself . Stay away from me . I 'll jump . Margaret , what 's this all about ? - They know . - They know what ? They know about my affair . They 're gonna tell my husband . - That 's not what this is about . - They 're trying to get me . - But I won 't let them . - Margaret . [ screaming ] - Jeepers ! - Get an ambulance . Can 't anyone stop this ? [ intense music ] [ thunder rumbling ] [ music continues ] Mr. Flynn . [ music continues ] Yes , The Bureau Of Extra-Normal Matters . 101 North Siegel , 6th floor . I think there 's been a murder . [ elevator bell rings ] And I think the killer 's still in the building . Send help . [ dramatic continues ] Charlie , did you see someone just come down the elevator ? No , siree . What 's up ? I think the person coming down just killed someone . Lana . What were you doing upstairs ? - Talking to Flynn . Why ? - But Flynn 's dead . ( Matt ) Hello , bureau . This is Matt Ritter . What 's going on ? Someone killed Flynn in your office . Belted him with your paperweight . Looks like your jobs safe after all . You implying something ? No one goes in there until homicide and forensics get here . ( Matt ) Well , look , you have the number here . So call me back . Right . Thanks . [ sighs ] That was my ranger friend . They 've spotted three maybe four sets of tracks . The bad news is , they 've lost the trail at the city 's edge . The aliens could be anywhere in Capitol City . Someone 's giving you a line of bull . If they were here , why hasn 't anyone seen ' em ? I don 't know . But there 's something else . The search party just spotted a second UFO . And the tracks from it are following the first ones . I would kill to get up there . [ intense music ] Oh , you know what I mean . Nobody 's going anywhere . A man 's been murdered and every one of you had a motive . That 's why I called you all back here tonight . Flynn could have been killed by anyone . A burglar . Mm-hmm . Except when I got back to my hotel room this evening I had a message from him . He said that one of you was out to kill him . There 's an entry in Flynn 's datebook for 9 o 'clock this evening . Minutes before the body was found . What 's the entry ? 9 : 00 p.m. , meet L.L. L.L. , huh ? Oh , come on . You don 't think I did it ? Why don 't we go over your story .. ... one more time ? There 's not much else to tell . ( Lana narrating ) As I stepped out of the elevator I saw Clark running into the stairwell . I was going to call to him but he was already gone . So I went in to talk to Flynn . I wanted to just clear up our earlier misunderstanding . About earlier , I 'm sorry if I was out of line . I found him in the bureau and I told him I needed to talk to him . But he refused . He went into his office and closed the door . You said you saw him running toward the stairwell . But you said earlier that he was already dead when you .. ... ran out . Well .. Maybe it wasn 't me that she saw . Maybe it was the murderer . Come on , people . Someone must have seen something . Someone coming or going . Anybody hanging around outside . Wait a minute , there was something . What ? When I checked out with the guard downstairs , I noticed .. ... that Lou hadn 't checked out yet . I thought that was strange since I knew I was the last one to go . What 's the big deal ? I just forgot to sign out . Forgot ? I 've been here for 20 years and not once has Charlie ever let me get by without signing in or out . L.L. Lou Lamont . You were the one in the appointment book at 9 o 'clock . He must have come back after I did . And killed him . Earlier I heard you tell Dennis that someone had belted Flynn with his paperweight . How did you know what the murder weapon was ? - You 're sweating , Lou . - He 's been doing that all day . Listen , I didn 't kill him . Sure , I came back to talk to him . But it was because I wanted to talk to him ... privately . ( Lou narrating ) I waited in the building until I was sure everyone had left . [ elevator bell rings ] I heard the elevator and knew someone was coming so I figured I 'd get blamed and I hid . ( Clark ) Mr. Flynn . [ intense music ] I was going to the lobby , but then I remembered the guard . So I got off in the second floor and waited for the police and the rest of you to arrive . Then I came back up . But I tell ya , I didn 't do it . Why did you wanna talk to Flynn ? Oh , I knew who you guys were looking for . I 'd been taking home office supplies for years . Nothing big , just pencils and stuff . Used to do it all the time when I worked at the newspaper . You can 't trust him . He 's the criminal type . You can tell just by looking at him . Listen .. I 'm not going to jail for something I didn 't do . Lou , don 't be stupid . I know it 's you two . ( Lou ) Clark , Lana . I know you 're both lying 'cause I was there . He was dead when I arrived . They must have killed him . ( Alexis ) They 're probably after our jobs . They are always trying to get field work . Sometimes even my field work . Well , it couldn 't have been me . He was alive when I was there . Someone else must have killed him when I left . I don 't know why you keep saying that . He was definitely dead when I saw him . What 're you saying , Clark ? That I am lying ? Is that what you 're saying ? That you think Lana 's lying ? No , I would never say that . About any of us . - I could . - So could I. Lou , I don 't know what it is that 's making us all act so paranoid . But we have to fight it . We 've been together long enough to realize that none of us is capable of doing the things that we 've been accused of . But we can 't all be telling the truth . Oh , no ? Well , listen to this . ( Clark narrating ) Flynn must have set everything up in advance . He assumed Lou would find the body when he came in for his 9 o 'clock meeting . Mr. Flynn . But he didn 't count on me coming back too . And this is where the plan went wrong . Flynn knew he had to cancel my 911 call quickly . Yes , operator , you just received a call from The Bureau Of Extra-Normal Matters ? It was by accident . What he also didn 't count on was Lana showing up . Mr. Flynn ? About earlier , I 'm sorry if I was out of line . He knew he had to get rid of her . I don 't want to talk about it now , leave me alone . Lou took the elevator down to the second floor like he said . It came back up ... and Lana took it down to the lobby where Charlie and I were waiting . Why would Flynn fake his own murder ? I don 't know . Unless of course he wanted all this to happen . Your whole story falls apart on one little point . The man had no pulse . You said so yourself . No pulse . No heat . No heat . No scent . The dogs couldn 't pick up the alien scent because .. ... you don 't have a pulse . - Let go of me . - Ice cold . - They 're aliens ? - They have to be . Including these two policemen . Which is why Flynn canceled the 911 call . They knew we 're the only one 's keeping record of their arrival . They came here to hold up the investigation . Maybe alter the records . Eliminate some files . Which means they 're interested in covering their own tracks . Right . Maybe because they 're on the run . Which would explain the presence of the second UFO . I knew you people were good . But not this good . [ intense music ] You couldn 't have figured all that out on your own . We had help . - But we won 't say who . - Who was it ? Come on , the other ship 's already landed . Let 's just get out of here . Alright , let 's go . You must have said something . Not him again . I suggest that you stop right there . Come on , there 's four of us and one of him . I like those odds . [ crackling ] ( Flynn ) Get off of me . Why 'd you do it , huh ? Couldn 't you take the pressure ? I told you everything would be fine if we just kept cool- - I didn 't do anything . It must have been one of them . He did it ! What are you pushing me for ? Don 't push me . They didn 't do it ! [ all grunting ] We 're looking for four escaped prisoners . I 've been expecting you . You 're from the second ship . We followed them here . We just want to return them to where they belong . First you 've to tell me , how did they do it ? How did they make everyone so paranoid ? We generate emotions the way you humans generate heat . In this case , the emotion was paranoia . I hope they didn 't cause you too much trouble . No . Not as much as they caused themselves . They just needed a little time together . [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

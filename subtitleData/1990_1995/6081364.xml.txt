 For your sake and the sake of those around you .. ... emergency measures have been taken . Emergency measures ? My powers are gone . We have removed your natural abilities as a precaution . Until they have undergone the natural evolution .. ... they would be unsafe , unpredictable . The purple crystal must be engaged . What evolution ? What purple crystal ? There is no purple crystal . Once inserted into the transport 's receptacle .. ... your abilities can once again be controlled . And they will be returned . If however the crystal is not found within eight hours this program will be terminated . And your abilities will be gone forever . Gone ? I 'll never fly again ? ( Jackson ) This is it . And this where you saw the crystal ? Right . Which should arrive at our hotel room within the hour . What about witnesses ? Is there any local corroboration to the sighting ? None , once it was on the ground . But I 've been replaying that day in my mind and there was something that might be significant . Well , every little bit helps . A pick-up truck passed just as I got here . Now , I didn 't think much about it at the time but they came right by here . They must have seen something . It 's not a lot to go on . We should start talking to the people in the area . Well , you know the Kent farm is just right over there . Clark lived around here ? Explains a lot . It 's as good a place to start as any . What 's wrong ? Nothing . - Lana ! - Hi ! How wonderful to see you ! What a nice surprise ! What a nice surprise ! I 'd like you to meet Matt Ritter and Dennis Jackson . How do you do ? They work with Clark and I at the Bureau . Clark talks about you both all the time , especially you . Is , uh , Clark here ? Um , well , he 's ... he 's around here somewhere . Why don 't we wait in the house ? Oh , that 's okay . I 'll go find him . Actually , we 're here on official business . About 20 years ago , to this exact week some kind of a UFO was sighted in that field over there . Twenty years . Well , that 's a long time . This is not a sight you 'd ever forget . And judging by how long and how deep the trench it left behind was , this was not a sound you would ever forget either . We were away a lot . We probably weren 't here . This is a farm , isn 't it ? Never heard of farmers who were away a lot . What I think he 's trying to say is it 's easy to forget things over time . But ... with a little effort , it can come back to you . Like tact . [ dramatic music ] I-I 'm sorry . Did I interrupt anything ? No , I was just doing some chores . What are you doing here ? Uh , Mr. Jackson and Matt are investigating a 20-year-old case . Something about a meteor landing nearby . Just about the same time we were born . Really ? How interesting ! Let 's go say hi . Are you coming ? We 're staying at the hotel in town . If you remember anything .. ... please ... call . Okay , Matt , the crystal should have arrived at the hotel by now . Your work must be very fascinating . Meteors , UFO 's , crystals . How do you tie that all together ? I found that crystal in the field the day all this happened , I must therefore assume a connection . - Simple . - Amazing ! Lana and I will check the rest of the farms on foot . - We 'll meet you in town . - You got it , chief . Come , see us again . Nice meeting you folks . That truck is a classic . Must be ... 20-years old ? More like 25 . Hello , Mr. Jackson . What are you doing way out here ? On the trail of a mystery , Kent . One I intend to solve . Nice meeting you folks . Thank you for your help . Miss . Lang . - See you later . - Alright . We 'll talk later . - He talked about a crystal . - Yeah . It sounded like the one you 're looking for . Probably fell off when the rocket hit . He 's expecting it to arrive at his hotel . He sent Matt Ritter to get it . I better get there first . - Can I borrow the truck ? - Oh , sure , sure , sure . No doubt about it . I 'm onto something here . I 've never seen you this excited . What 'd they say ? Wasn 't anything they said , was what they drive . Theirs was the pick-up truck I saw that day . We need to check with the Smallville clerk 's office . I want birth certificates medical records , everything on the Kents . I 've known the Kents all my life . They 'd have to be pretty sure to be hiding anything . A look into their past won 't hurt . I wish I hadn 't sent Matt off in the car . I 'll tell you what .. ... I 'll get the information for you . You can continue with the investigation out here . When you get back in town , it 'll be ready . Okay . Wait a second ! You 're my guide . How am I supposed to find my way back ? I 'll draw you a map . [ dramatic music ] Hello , Lana . Forget something ? No Mooney Road here . Well .. ... if it isn 't my old punching bag . Hello , Richard . I thought after graduation you became one of them lily-white city types . Well , I come back every now and again . Just to remind myself of why I left . What do you want , Kent ? I 'm supposed to pick up a package for my boss . That 's it there . I don 't see nothing on there about no Kent . Come on , Richard . It 'll make me look good with my boss . You understand . Well .. ... it 's against regulations . But I guess I couldn 't say anything if you were to go ahead and just take it .. ... while my back was turned . Hmm ? [ intense music ] What do you think I am ? Stupid ? Now , get out of here ! Wimp ! - Lana ! - Hello , Clark . Or should I say Superboy ? [ dramatic music ] How could I possibly be Superboy ? I have a theory about that . That meteor Mr. Jackson 's investigating . He said it crashed to earth 20 years ago , yesterday . On your birthday . - That 's a co-inci- - - I 'm not done . Let 's just say there was something on board . Something like a baby .. ... with unimaginable strength . And let 's say a couple happened by .. ... a childless couple . Does any of this ringing a bell ? And let 's say this child grows up with powers and ability that eclipse any normal boy 's . It 's only obvious he 'd need another identity .. ... to protect the ones he loves . Mr. Jackson said he saw a truck driving away from crash site . A truck owned by a ... local couple . A childless couple . Ma and Pa Kent ? Which can only mean one thing . That baby was you . That 's just about the dumbest story I think I 've ever heard . Not to mention , it 's just bad investigative technique . Where 's your proof ? What good is a theory without proof ? This time I 'm gonna get proof . Ow ! Lana , what are you doing ? Getting my proof . This-This is some kind of trick . Ow ! Cut it out ! I 'm sorry but I , uh .. I was .. - I was so sure . - Well , you are wrong . Maybe this will put an end to your silly theories . Of course . Clark , I , uh .. Clark , I 'm sorry I didn 't .. Ow ! Stop that ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry . [ light music ] Where the hell am I ? Hey ! Hey ! Wait ! I 'm lost . Can you help me ? I bet I can . There 's only an hour left . How am I gonna get that crystal ? Easy , son , easy . Don 't give up hope . I almost had it .. ... if it wasn 't for that Richard Charles . After all these years , I can 't believe he 's still trying to hurt you . Only , now , he can . Clark , don 't forget what I always told you . At the heart of every bully is a coward afraid to be found out . A coward . ( Jackson ) What do you mean ? That 's alright , he 's probably gone out to dinner . I 'll try again . Figures ! Finally got a foothold in my first case in 20 years I 'm stuck here , in the middle of nowhere . ( female # 1 ) Ouch ! Is my company so bad ? Nah , of course not . You 're so tense , Dennis . Gotta learn to relax . After all , it 's just a job . - That 's easy for you to say . - No , it 's easy to do . Just have to learn how . ( Matt ) Listen , I heard . But when my boss comes in , if I don 't have that package I 'm gonna be in deep trouble . Now , I understand you 're closing soon .. The box stays here . Until somebody named Jackson shows me some proof . Are you city folks this dense ? There 's no need to get hostile . Maybe it 's just that us city folks have a little class . I 'll show you the kind of class us country folk have . ( Clark ) I wouldn 't do that . Or what ? Try me . [ dramatic music ] Hey , listen . Hey , I didn 't mean anything by it . I 'm just tired of that whole , that whole city attitude . Hey ! Hey . Hey . Come on , it 's no biggie . Tell him ! Look-Look you can have your stupid box . Okay ? Thanks a lot . Is there anything I can do to repay you ? Uh , yeah , you could . Give me that . You 're involved in this ? Do me a favor . Don 't ask me any questions . Okay . Would you do me a favor ? Don 't tell anyone where you got it . Ow ! [ dramatic music ] So that 's it . Thanks , Pa . Time 's running out . The purple crystal must be activated . I sure hope this works . [ whirring ] I don 't know how you talked me into this , Grace . I told you , I 'm gonna teach you how to relax . - Hmm . - I was like you . Burning out in a high stress job . Comin ' home to a high-rise . Then I gave it all up , and came here . It 's made all the difference . Look around you , Dennis . There are other things in life besides work . Like clouds . You 're right , of course . Sometimes I miss the most obvious things . Congratulations ! You 're on your way to full maturity . Until the next time of passage , be well . Hearing 's back . Hello ? - Is somebody there ? - Lana , are you okay ? It 's you . What are you doing all the way out here alone ? I figured it out . Somehow you 've lost your powers . That 's why the pin didn 't bend . You 're crazy . I saw you when you left the hotel . You stubbed your toe . You 're just a normal guy now . Oh , no ! But I-I thought , I thought that .. Lana , get some help . And leave poor Clark alone . But when I stabbed Clark , it shouldn 't have gone in but it did . And when I stabbed you , without your powers .. ... it should 've gone in but it didn 't . So Clark and .. No . But you .. You know what you need ? - What ? - Proof . Would Clark do this ? What are you so happy about ? Apparently , I missed something last night . Where did you two go ? I ended up having to eat dinner by myself . Thought I was gonna have to spend the whole trip back to capital city , bolstering your ego . Nonsense . Why ? Because you didn 't solve your big case . The crystal 's gone . Probably lost in the mail . You still have no idea what landed here or where it went . Doesn 't that bother you a little ? Matthew , my boy .. ... you 're gonna have to learn how to relax . After all , it 's only a job . Think I can catch a ride to the airport with you ? More the merrier . So now that you 've had time to think about it .. ... I bet you feel kind of silly about that whole Superboy thing , huh ? [ theme music ]

 [ Woman Narrating ] " Previously on " Earth 2 . What do you think ? Could this have been built by penal colonists ? [ Yale ] They were a group of radical biologists . They were outlawed on the stations for proposing domes like this one . - " Yale , what is it ? " - Devon , this wasn 't from my files . This must be memory . Yes ? You 're on duty . [ Morgan Narrating ] Night 66 on the planet ... and the nights keep getting longer . Our new winter camp kept out the snow , but not the cold ... or the dark ... or the voices we heard in our sleep . [ Distant Chattering ] [ Shouting , Screaming ] Night , of course , is when ghosts come out . I never knew what Yale 's ghosts were , but I knew they couldn 't be ignored . Not anymore . You want to know what Yale is like ? He 's like that big elephant in the middle of the room that nobody wants to talk about . But you gotta talk about him sooner or later , 'cause he 's gonna sit on you and break your head . And what really bothers me ... is that he 's your elephant , and it 's my head . Has Yale broken anybody 's head ? Has he as much as even said a cross word ? It 's only a matter of time , Devon . They recalled those mindwashed criminals for a reason . It was to dismantle them before they dismantled us . You don 't know anything about Yale . That 's what scares me . Nobody knows . Not me . Not you . Not even the cyborg knows . Yale is not a cyborg . Yale is a human being with peripheral enhancements . Okay , if you want to split hairs , fine . But here 's a definition you can 't dispute . The man is a ticking time bomb . Good night , Morgan . Sleep well , Devon . I won 't . [ Thunderclap ] [ Yelps ] [ Rumbling ] [ Woman ] It 's an earthquake . ! Take cover . ! We 're under attack ! Everybody ! Look out ! - " Dad . ! Dad . ! " - You okay , girl ? Yeah . What 's happening ? I don 't know , sweetheart . Julia , get away from the tent ! I 'm okay . Trying to get through the tent . Come on . Move it . ! Come on . ! [ Shouting Continues ] It stopped . Everybody okay ? Yeah , we 're fine . Yeah , fine . Yeah , we 're okay . Just freezing . That 's all . Did you see that lightning ? Huh ? Right before the shaking started , a bolt landed right behind that hill . Let 's check it out . Honey , you keep warm , all right ? Okay . You left your shoes in Julia 's tent . It 's just a little earthquake . It 's over now . Everything 's gonna be okay . Bess , space stations move . Planets don 't move . It was the one thing I liked about this place , Bess . The one thing . I know . I know . Shh . It 's gonna be okay . Shh . Yale ? Yale , you okay ? Yale , are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . [ Sighs ] You 're very lucky you didn 't get hit by any of this stuff . Devon , we 've got to leave this camp immediately . What ? We 're not safe here . We 've got to leave right away . Yale , I know that these tremors can be unsettling , but you know they don 't necessarily get worse , or even repeat themselves so - It 's more than that . I have a terrible feeling about this place . Yale , does this have anything to do with your nightmare ? Nightmares ? What nightmares ? Well , earlier I had to turn off your hologrip . Weren 't you having a bad dream ? No . Yale , if there 's anything bothering you - There 's nothing bothering me . I 'm fine . Are you sure ? I said I 'm fine . Wow . You feel that ? It 's warm over here . You 're kidding . Oh , my God . And it 's comin ' from right here . Don 't go in there , John . [ Chuckles ] Danziger ! John ! Don 't make me come in there and find you . Take a look at this . Careful . It 's really hot . What is it ? I don 't know . I 've never seen anything like it . You 're sure it 's not radioactive or toxic in any way ? No , it appears to be completely benign . It also appears to store and release energy with an incredible efficiency . In this case , I 'm sure it 's the energy produced by the lightning . - Could be an ideal power source . - That 's a relief . We have had our doubts about our generator 's ability to make it through the winter . Yeah , worse than doubts . This stuff could save our skins . Why does it emit that sound ? It does vibrate at a high frequency . I 'm surprised that you can hear that . Uh , how much of that stuff would you say is down there ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna find out . Heat . Light . Hell , maybe I can convert it to fuel for the vehicles once we get back on the road again . It 's a completely unknown substance . You people embrace every new thing without thinking . It 's lunacy ! [ Door Closes ] Yale does , uh , have a point . Julia , why don 't you , uh , confirm your test , and , Danziger , why don 't you collect more samples of , uh - What should we call it ? We 'll call it Morganite . And we 're gonna stake a claim , we 're gonna " fl " y back home , and we 're gonna bring back a mining crew , and they 're gonna haul this stuff out of here by the ton ! Morgan , I know you 're excited , but try not to get your hopes up . The first rule of mining is that most finds don 't pan out . Where 's the geolock ? I was beginning to think we 'd never get to use this thing . I got a feeling about this . This could be our chance of a lifetime , Bess . Morgan , it 's leaking . What ? Oh , my God ! You don 't suppose it got damaged in the quake , do you ? Oh , this can 't be happening ! The mineral find of the century , and our claim-staker we 've been lugging around for hundreds of miles is on the fritz ! Morgan , stop it ! Now , one thing at a time . We 're gonna take this geolock outside , try it out and make sure that it 's working properly . Okay . And we 're gonna find out if there 's a claim worth staking . Okay . I 'm gonna pack up the geolock , and I want you to check outside and make sure the coast is clear . Okay . Morgan , here 's our leak . Hey , be careful ! We don 't want you petrified too . Don 't worry . These things are perfectly safe , as long as you follow the instructions . Okay , let 's see . You sure you know what you 're doing there , Bess ? Okay . Initiation code 203-098 . Morgan , I wish you would 've cracked the abort code . Why do we need an abort code ? Well , for safety . [ Computer Voice ] Please enter countdown time . Fifteen seconds . Please enter zone size . Give it the zone size . Morgan , do you feel like someone 's watching us ? What are you talking about ? What ? What ? Oh , my God . One of those vicious little rodent things . Oh , no . All right , stay calm . Morgan . Morgan , just be careful . Go ! - Morgan ! - [ Trilling ] Scram ! Don 't make it angry . [ Trilling ] [ Computer Voice ] Please enter zone size . Five meters . Make it 10 meters . Maybe we can get the rat . Morgan , you 're confusing the machine . Oh , I 'm sure the machine can tell the difference between two voices . Lock-on selected . Are you certain ? Yes ! Yes ! Yes . Reaction will commence in 15 seconds . Move away from the zone . Okay , let 's go . Move away from the zone . Move away from the zone . All right . Come on . Ten seconds . Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two - Morgan , shouldn 't we be just a little further away ? Why ? You told it five meters . You told it 10 ! - [ Whimpering ] - Come on ! It 's not stopping ! [ Screaming ] Oh , my God . Look at this . It 's not cold . It doesn 't freeze things . It petrifies them . Well , I guess this thing still works . Yeah . [ Grunting ] Your prescription was right , Dr. Heller . Physical exertion does combat the aggression . It wasn 't exactly a prescription , Yale . It was more of a guess . And the tests you ran ? I analyzed your E.E.G. I wish there was more that I could tell you . Tell me anything . If there is a breakdown , Yale , it 's happening somewhere in between , beyond where medicine and technology can reach . I suspected as much . Cyborg science has never fully understood how body and machine interface . Let 's not overreact . I mean , aside from your growing anxiety , you 're not exhibiting any other symptoms , are you ? Well , there was the aural hallucination . I thought I heard that rock . I 'm not sure you didn 't hear it . I did further testing on the mineral - biological scans in addition to the geological . And what did you find ? There seems to be a movement inside the stones . It 's like an impulse , similar to that in a nervous synapse . [ Chuckles ] What are you saying ? I was eavesdropping in some nervous system ? Well , it 's too early to say . But my point is that you might be overreacting to your emotional state . This may not be a mindwash failure . But the images , the feelings - They do seem like memory , Julia . Why don 't you investigate these memories ? No . No . I 've tried it before . It doesn 't work . Then my only suggestion is to continue doing what you 're doing . Come and see me if any other symptoms develop . [ Zero ] I 've collected more minerals . Let 's have a look . Every rock they take , I can feel it coming out of me . Morgan , I will say it again . If two or three crates is enough to dent the supply , then it 's not worth fighting over . - That all you could find ? - My sensors say there is more , but it is embedded in the tunnel walls . All right . I 'll head down there later . Go stow that stuff by the batteries over there . But don 't let it touch anything . It 's hot enough to melt Mylar . My body is 12 % Mylar . Will it melt me ? I should be so lucky . Go on . Danziger ? Yeah ? Uh , can I talk with you for a minute ? Yeah , shoot . Uh , in private . This , uh-This isn 't very easy for me to bring up right now . You 're worried about Yale . We all are . Is the crew talking ? Anybody can see he 's slipping . Let 's not jump to any conclusions . Everybody 's had a difficult time adjusting . Adair , if you want to talk , let 's talk . If not , I got plenty of things to do . When the Yales first started breaking down , my , uh - my parents brought Yale in to be examined . We were told there was no hope , that he was going to break down just like the rest of them . My parents wanted to get rid of him , but , uh , I wouldn 't let them . I convinced them that he was different somehow ... and that if we cared for him enough , he would stay balanced . After enough time went by , it seemed like I was right . And now that just seems hopelessly naive . Devon , I sincerely hope that it wasn 't naive . And I hope he 'll remain stable just like he has up until now . But if he doesn 't , you will be the first one to recognize the warning signs . I know . Has he lied to you ? Yale doesn 't lie . Most mind-modified cyborgs have a self-preservation program ... that will deny the occurrence of glitches . It 's a common design " fl " aw . You know that , right ? If he starts to lie , especially to you , it would indicate a serious turn for the worse . And what if there is a turn for the worse ? What do we do ? Oh , come on . Do what they did on the stations ? Devon , I can 't say - Oh , come on . I am not gonna line Yale up and shoot him down like a rabid animal . I am not ! The Yales that they didn 't catch in time " became " rabid animals . We have to make sure that doesn 't happen . It will not . I know Yale better than any one of you , and it will not happen . Devon , we care about him too . Deeply . He 's part of our family now . [ Sighs ] You have to trust us . Trust us to treat him with the dignity he deserves . Just like we trust you to warn us if our safety 's at stake . All right ? Hey , Bess , guess what . I was thinking , why do we have to go down there ? I mean , why bother with a survey ? Why don 't we just set off the geolock ? Morgan , honey , we don 't even know if there 's anything to claim yet . Oh , yeah . That 's right . That 's right . We have to go down there . Why are you standing all the way over there ? It 's my legs . They 're frozen . I - They 're afraid . You 're not gonna go down there with me , are you ? Um ... no . No . I 'm sorry . I can 't . I hate little places like that . I hate the dark . Okay . I 'm gonna go in the cave by myself , and you can stay here and do something else . Something like - Well , like - Um , a business plan . Yeah . Yeah . 'Cause we need a business plan . Okay . And there 's marketing and production ... and deal structures . These things don 't happen by themselves . Good idea , Morgan . Bess , be careful . [ Humming , Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ John ] Bess . [ Gasps ] Danziger . What are you doin ' down here ? Me ? I , uh - I was just exploring and - And collecting some rocks . I love rocks . You know , my-my father used to be a miner back on Earth . Did you know that ? Really ? Yeah , Dad - He taught me a lot about rocks and mining . Not that I 'm mining or anything . You 're not ? Nah . No . There 's , uh - There 's not really enough Morganite here to make it worth my while . Morganite ? Okay . I am looking to stake a claim . But there 's no reason not to . Mm , I see . Legally , any find on an unclaimed asteroid , moon or planet ... can be verbally claimed . You know , I might have expected this from your husband . You know , there 's no reason that you and True can 't make a claim of your own . Somewhere else . I don 't think so . [ Indistinct Gurgling ] Danziger , what was that ? I don 't know . [ Gurgling Continues ] Danziger , where did they go ? Shh . They could be anywhere . [ Gasps ] What 's happening ? [ Shouting ] It 's another quake . ! [ Bess Screams ] You okay ? Yeah . Let 's get out of here . Come on . Wait , Danziger . Look . Oh , my God . [ Chattering ] [ Chattering Continues ] It 's not like anything I 've ever seen in any Earth mines . I mean , the way those Terrians made that pile , and then boom - They were definitely trying to attract lightning ... or make some kind of an earthquake or something . Well , the quake revealed more of those glowing veins . Yeah . I 've been studying the composition of these rocks . Their resemblance to the Terrians themselves is truly uncanny . I mean , I would go so - Just bear with me . What if the Terrians and the planet are one species , and these veins aren 't just minerals , they 're-they 're part of a vast bodily system ? Like nerves or circulation ? Or intelligence or their-their communication network . That 's what it was like . It was like the Terrians were trying to talk to the planet . [ Sighs ] My gosh . We have to return all those rocks that we 've taken . Wait a minute . Not so fast here . I agree the Terrians were probably trying to cause some kind of a chain reaction , but let 's not forget that those rocks are our best chance of surviving this winter . It is nice having warm tents . Yeah . The Terrians haven 't complained about us using the rocks . Have you had any more dreams ? Not a whisper . Starting to miss them actually . Still , I don 't think we should be taking more rocks . Finally a voice of reason . If we get overeager , we could get burned . Literally . So what ? We keep the rocks that we have , but we don 't take any more until we have more answers . - Good idea . - All right . Come on , honey . Let 's get you cleaned up . Okay . You were brilliant . What do you mean that wasn 't an act ? Morgan , just hear me out . I just don 't think it 's right to take something from the Terrians that they might need . Bess , look . Since we got to this hellish planet , I have been tied up , shot at , poisoned and pronounced dead . Now , after all of that , I am not going to go home ... with nothing but a few good anecdotes . It 's the first law of pioneering , Bess : To the survivor go the spoils . I understand that , Morgan . And when the opportunity is right , we will get our spoils . No , Bess , that 's where you 're wrong . I used to think that way . Five years I spent on level four , doing the work of guys who got promoted over me . And that 's because I was the sucker down there , doing the work and waiting for my big chance . And the smart guys , they were out there making their chances happen . Bess , this is our big chance . Now , come on . I thought that 's why we came out here - to be a part of something big . Bess , I thought we were together on this . We are together on it . Why do you think I went down in the cave , Morgan ? Then why are you backing out on me for the sake of some dirt people ? Because it isn 't right , Morgan ! Right and wrong ! Ever hear of it ? You ever hear of loyalty ? What ? You ever hear of sticking together through thick and thin ? You are unbelievable . I can 't talk to you . Fine . I 'll stake my own claim . [ Beeping ] [ Door Opens ] Listen , uh , whatever we decide in here , let 's keep it to ourselves , okay ? I don 't want to get Devon all riled up about this . [ Baines ] Yeah , fine . But we still have to spell it out . What are we going to do when Yale goes ? [ Alonzo ] We don 't know for sure he 'll lose it . [ Magus ] Alonzo , almost all the ex-convicts inducted into the Yale program ... had mindwash failure before the recall . But most went years ago . We all hope that Yale remains intact . But on the chance that he doesn 't , the safety of the group is more important ... than any personal feelings we might have for him . [ Alonzo ] What are you proposing ? I don 't know . Twenty-four-hour monitoring ? Armed ? [ Walman ] Shouldn 't we talk to Devon ? I already have . It 's hard for her . It 's hard enough for us . [ Baines ] And ifhe goes , and we 're the ones on watch ? Use your bestjudgment . Do what you have to do . Okay . [ Danziger ] All right . Take your full five . I 'll see you out there . [ Yale ] When the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock , they were united in their quest for religious freedom . [ Making Airplane Noises ] In what other ways was their journey different from ours ? The " Mayflower " didn 't crash-land . Keep that away from me , please ! Aw , Mom . Pay attention to Yale , Uly . That 's all right . I think we 've had enough for today . [ Devon ] Uly , please . [ Shouting ] Your mother took that for a reason ! Yale ! Are you okay , Uly ? Yale did not mean to scare you . You know that , don 't you ? Mm-hmm . Are you sure you 're okay ? I 'll be right back . Do you want to tell me what just happened ? I - I don 't know . Yale , please . You owe me an explanation . Don 't you think I know that ? I care for you too . More than anyone . Yale , you can fight this . You can stop this from happening . I 'm a Yale series tutor . An artificially rehabilitated criminal like all the others . Their fate is my fate . That 's not true . Yale , you 've outlived them by decades . But the man buried in here never went away , and the line between him and me wears thinner every day . Whoever you once were , it 's just a memory . I know you , Yale . You are a good man . You can 't see the nightmares . [ Shuddering ] The faces , the pain ... and suffering I 've caused . I can help you , Yale . No . No more help ! You were always a stubborn little girl when you forced your parents to keep me . You 're still stubborn , Devon ! You aren 't helping ! You can 't help ! Yale , please . Let 's go ! Outta here ! Move it ! Get down ! - [ Yelling ] - [ Screaming ] [ Grunting , Shouting ] We ask for sanctuary under the Federal Agreement of Science . We 're unarmed . We surr - Sanctuary - We surren - We 're unarmed . No . ! [ Soldier 's Voice ] Outta here . ! Move it . ! [ Woman 's Voice ] We surren - We 're unarmed . No . ! [ Lasers Firing ] [ Grunting ] Morgan ? Morgan , you awake ? [ Instrument Beeping ] What am I supposed to do ? I 'm supposed to pass up the opportunity of a lifetime ? That wouldn 't be right . That would be nuts . [ Thunderclap ] Oh , boy . How does this go again ? [ Mumbling ] Okay . Uh , initiation code , uh , 203 , uh , 098 . [ Computer Voice ] Please enter countdown time . Uh , 20 minutes . [ Computer Voice ] Please enter zone size . Zone size . I don 't know . Um , what-what 's the maximum ? Uh , a kilometer . I think camp 's farther away than a kilometer . Lock-on selected . Are you certain ? Yes , of course I 'm certain . Reaction will commence in 20 minutes . Move away from the zone . Yes , sir . Move away from the zone . Move away from the zone . Move away from the zone . Move away - We 've checked all the tents and vehicles . Nobody 's seen Yale anywhere . Thanks , Magus . I 'll be right out there . Mom , I found Yale 's gear . It has a message on it . Thank you , Uly . I am sorry not to tell you this in person . I know it 's best for all concerned . I 'm a danger to the group . [ Yale Continues ] Not because of what I was , but because of what I find myself becoming . It gives me terrible sadness , but I have to say good-bye . Don 't - Don 't try to find me . I won 't be back . I love you too much to do that . Oh . Yale . [ Sighs ] [ Mumbling ] " Dear Morgan : Okay , honey , " if you will wait till we figure out more about the Terrians , " I will keep surveying the tunnels . That 's where I am right now . " Oh , my God ! The geolock ! She 'll be petrified ! Bess . Bess ? Bess ! Honey ? Where are you ? Bess ! Bess , we 've only got about six minutes ! Bess ! Bess ! [ Instrument Beeping ] I was looking for Yale , and I heard it counting down . Look at this thing . What is it ? [ Computer Voice ] Reaction will commence in five minutes . It 's a geolock . What is that ? It 's a chemical claim-staker . What does it do exactly ? It petrifies the earth , so nobody without a key compound can penetrate it . Morganite . What ? Those rocks we found - The Martins have already named the stuff . They must be trying to stake a claim or something . Stake a claim ? Are they serious ? What do - [ Computer Voice ] Do not tamper with geolock . Oh , my God . Move away from the zone . Wait a minute . What 's the zone size ? One kilometer . Come on . Let 's go . Wait . The camp ! Do not tamper with the geolock . You 're wasting your time ! Come on , now ! Get all your people . Warn the camp . Bess ! We 've got three minutes to live ! Where are you ? [ Indistinct Growling ] [ Gasps ] Shh . Shh , shh , shh . Yale . Yale , what 's the matter with you ? There are Terrians down here . I know . I know . They 're gone . Are you sure ? [ Screaming , Whimpering ] Reaction will commence in one minute . [ All Shouting ] Morgan and Bess have gone below . ! Mom , what about Yale ? I don 't know . Take him . Is everybody out ? There 's nobody in there . Come on , Zero ! Come on ! We have to get out of here ! [ Beeping ] Oh , my God ! Help ! Help me . ! Help . ! Come on . Morgan ! I heard Morgan ! We can 't stop now , Bess ! No ! No ! We 're almost there ! Bess ! Four , three , two . Commencing . Morgan ! Bess ! Oh , my God ! Listen . What the heck ? Where is it gonna stop ? Morgan ! Bess . ! - Morgan ? Morgan ! Morgan ! - Bess ! Oh , God ! - " We 're gonna die , Bess . " - No , we 're okay now . - We gotta get outta here ! - Are you okay ? No , we 're not okay ! Yes . Yes . [ Rippling ] Oh , my God , Morgan ! That 's the geolock ! Geolock ? [ Bess ] Morgan , you didn 't . ! Uh , yes . Where is it ? I don 't - Morgan , we 're gonna be petrified ! I don 't know where it is ! Where is the sound coming from ? She 's dying ! The earth is dying ! Okay , that way ! Go ! Go ! [ Screaming ] [ Gasps ] [ Groaning ] [ Gasps , Panting ] It froze him ! It froze him into the wall . [ Growling , Moaning ] [ Morgan Narrating ] At that moment , I understood what Bess was trying to tell me from the start . Opportunity comes at a cost .

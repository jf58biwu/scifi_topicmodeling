 Kids ... Mom ! Mom ! Kevin ! Mom ! Ruby 's gone ! Ruby ? Agent Mulder 's latest 302 . Requesting assignment and travel expenses for the both of you . Sioux City , Iowa . That 's the first I 've heard of it . It came up through channels , from Mulder 's ASAC to the District G-14 , then my desk . I don 't understand . In essence , Mulder is petitioning the Bureau to assign a case number to a tabloid headline . - He must have more evidence than ... - Not according to his 302 . I admit , that is strange . Even for Mulder . Perhaps it has something to do with this . Take a look . An X-File ? Has he shared this with you ? There 's no need to protect him . He initiated the file himself . She was his sister . She disappeared 21 years ago . He was 12 and she was 8 . He claims that he was in the room when it happened . He recalls a ... bright light outside the window and a presence in the room . In your opinion , has Agent Mulder 's personal agenda clouded his professional judgement ? In my opinion , no . But you can see how it might appear that way ? As you know , Mulder 's preoccupation with fringe matters has been a source of friction in the Bureau . This is another case in point . I 'm going to disallow the 302 . With respect , sir , at least let me talk with him and make a recommendation . It just doesn 't seem substantial enough to warrant an investigation . So we disagree . It 's not the first time , it won 't be the last . - lf we had a legitimate source ... - This is the essence of science . Ask an impertinent question , you 're on your way to a pertinent answer . What makes this case any more credible than the 100-year-old mother with the lizard baby ? Because the lizard baby wasn 't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee . Oko-what ? Bogee . Okobogee . is that supposed to mean something to me ? If you know anything about trout fishing . Or UFO hot spots . Define hot spot . Four sightings in 1967 , August , including one by a National Weather Service plane . This is a light-blasted digitally-enhanced enlargement . The pilot took that ? Try a Girl Scout with an lnstamatic . Four girls said they saw something . Five , including the Den Mother . The Air Force said it was a weather balloon . But no weather balloon was launched that day within 700 miles . Now read me the names of those Girl Scouts from 1967 . Lisa Terrel , Bonnie Winston , Doreen McCallister , Darlene Mor ... lt 's the same Darlene Morris . Darlene Morris ? I 'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder . We talked with you on the phone last night . Please come in . Well , I knew that if I screamed loud and long enough that someone would listen . But I never expected the fbi . This is Kevin . Kevin , say hi . Would you like some coffee ? Some days I can 't even get myself up out of bed . And Kevin has been acting so strange . I don 't know what to do any more . I just want her back again . Ms Morris , during the divorce , was there a custody battle ? Charles had nothing to do with this . How can you be so sure ? Because I know what happened . It 's just like it was before . - Summer of 1967 ? The Girl Scout troop ? - How did you know about that ? Your name 's on record at the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston , Illinois . Really ? A pilot made a similar sighting over the same area on the same day . They took her , didn 't they ? You ... you said that , Kevin was there the night it happened ? He didn 't see anything . He was asleep . Can I talk to him anyway ? Thanks . You know , I 've told this story so many times now . Go to the newspapers and the police . And every time I tell it , people get this ... look in their eye . Just like the look that you 've got right now . Hey , buddy . Mind if I sit down ? Thanks . Your mom tells me you 've been having nightmares . I guess so . - You wanna tell me about ' em ? - No . All right . What are you doing ? You making something ? Can I take a look at it ? Thanks . It 's coming from there . The TV ? Maybe it 's a binary sequence . Could be anything , could be nothing . I know you 're busy . Look , I know a friend who knows a friend who can get you a ticket to a Redskins game . You got it ! All right . You know where to find me ? Thanks , Danny . So , as I was telling your partner , we found no evidence of kidnap . No phone call , no ransom note . - And since we have no body ... - You assumed she ran away ? It wouldn 't be the first time Ruby ran away from home . How do you explain what her mother saw ? I think Darlene has a very active imagination . I 've heard those stories since first grade . So , basically , you ignored her statement . - l included it in my report . - But you didn 't bother to check it out . We found nothing at the campsite . Let me tell you something . Darlene 's little girl was no prom queen . I can 't count the number of times I pulled her out of parked cars or found her puking her guts out . - lt was just a matter of time before ... - Before what ? Before something bad happened. lf Darlene makes up stories to get past that , fine . But don 't tell me it 's the truth . I 'm not gonna waste my time . I just think it 's a good idea not to antagonise local law enforcement . Who , me ? I 'm Mr Congeniality . We might need his help one of these days . I 'll send him a Bundt cake . You 're looking for Ruby , right ? That 's right . Who are you ? Doesn 't matter . Are you a friend of Ruby 's ? Ruby didn 't have friends . She just had people she liked to hang with . And she liked to hang out with you ? I guess we had some times . - Like the night she disappeared ? - lt was Greg . She was supposed to see him that night . - Who 's Greg ? - Her boyfriend , Greg Randall . Supposed to meet up at the lake . They had stuff to talk about . What kind of stuff ? Greg got Ruby pregnant . Whatever . She got herself pregnant . Do you know what they were planning to do about it ? They were gonna leave town . At least that 's what Ruby told me . You know Greg from school ? Greg ? School ? I don 't think so . All he ever did since we met him was pour beer . The Pennsylvania Pub . Excuse me ! Do you know where we can find Greg Randall ? Who 's asking ? What kind of trouble 's he in now ? We were hoping you could tell us . Greg called in sick three weeks ago . I haven 't heard from him since . Any ideas where he might have gone ? No , but if you find him , tell him he 's fired . This is our hotel if you hear of anything . That 's a nice tattoo . What is that ? What 's it look like ? A flying saucer . You don 't believe that stuff , do you ? I take it you don 't ? No , I think it 's just a bunch of crazy people howling at the moon . So , you haven 't been out to Lake Okobogee , have you ? No , I haven 't . Why ? You should ride with us some time . You might see some things that 'd change your mind . Get a killer sunburn in the middle of the night . Where 's Mulder ? Where did you get the document ? If you explain what you 're talking about , maybe I can help . This is a document ? It just looks like a bunch of ones and zeros to me . - Tell me where you got it . - Tell me what it is . Keep playing games and you 'll be facing the D6 . You can explain to them why you 're obstructing justice . It 's your call , Holtzman . But I 'm not accountable to anybody outside my subcommittee . I don 't care if it 's the NSA or the Vatican police . It 's a defence satellite transmission . You 're kidding ! A fragment , but highly classified . We need to know where it came from . Well , sure . I 'll let you know as soon as I find out . You just bought yourself a one-way back to Washington . We got it . Great . What ? You shouldn 't have told ' em . They have no jurisdiction . Mulder , they 're NSA . They think the boy 's a threat to national security . How can an 8-year-old boy who can barely multiply be a threat to national security ? People call me paranoid . How did Kevin obtain top-secret information ? Where do you think he got it from ? Watch your step , ma 'am . It 'll be OK , baby . Don 't worry . - lt 'll be OK . - Come with me , son . Mom ! It 'll be all right , baby . Watch your head , please . You guys do really delicate work . Let 's get this to Cryptography . I think we got what we needed . Thank you . - What is it ? - l 'm not sure . - We scanned it through the mainframe . - And none of the information is actionable ? Other than the satellite transmission , none of it is a national security risk . The boy 's being released later . So it was just a random set of ones and zeros ? There was nothing random about it . I don 't understand . All information can be rendered digitally in a series of ones and zeros . When we downloaded the data , we found an amazing range of ... Well , see for yourself . Da Vinci 's Universal Man . A DNA double helix . There 's lots more . That 's the Brandenburg Concertos . But they 're just fragments . Some lines from the Koran , a Shakespearean sonnet . Like someone 's switching channels ? - Mrs Morris ? - l have nothing to say to you . Please , give me a minute to explain . Would you please just wait over there for mama ? I 'll be right there . - l thought you were supposed to help us . - This has been a terrible mistake . The government will pay for all repairs and damages . I don 't want your money . I want my daughter back . And I want you to leave us alone . But your son has seen something . You stay away from me and you stay away from my child . Come on , honey . It 's OK . Let 's go now . I thought we were headed back into town . Where are we going ? The boy is the key , Scully. I know it . - The key to what ? - Finding Ruby . Just think about it for a minute . He 's receiving digitised data from a television screen . Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration . - l admit it 's not much of an explanation ... - l think that Kevin is a conduit of some kind . A conduit ? A link ... or a connection to whoever or whatever took Ruby that night . But how ? If there was an abduction , it 's likely that Kevin was touched in some way . Mulder , I know what you 're thinking . I know why this is so important to you . I know ! But there is no evidence indicating an abduction . That 's why we 're going to Lake Okobogee . According to the police photos , Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here . Just a stone 's throw from the forest wall . Meaning what ? Meaning anybody could have come out of the forest to grab her . Have you noticed the tree line ? Evidence of extreme heat . Or an electrical storm . Besides which , there 's nothing to connect it to the night - of Ruby 's disappearance . - That 's true . Do you think lightning could have caused this ? Do you have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass ? 2,500 ' Fahrenheit . Something was out here . Something hot enough to turn sand into glass . To singe those trees and to blister the roof of that camper . Mulder ! Look ! What is it ? It 's a grave . Shallow , by the smell of it . What are you doing ? Mulder , you are disturbing a crime scene . Stop ! What if it 's her ? I need to know . Are you OK , Mulder ? Fine . Looks like a male Caucasian . Sir . Victim 's name was Greg Randall . - Ruby 's boyfriend . - Ruby had a lot of boyfriends . - Can I take a look at that ? - Go right ahead . Look at that . It 's her . The girl from the library . Who ? We didn 't get her name , but she claimed Greg and Ruby had run off together . Well , Doc Fowler 's a buddy of mine . Delivered both my kids . I can find out who had that appointment . Have a seat , Tessa . We know that you lied to us the other day . We know that you had the appointment with Dr Fowler on August 7th . We know that you 're pregnant , not Ruby . - Then you don 't know nothing . - We can prove it , Tessa . And we can prove that Greg ... was the father . So what if he was the father ? This is very serious . Do you understand how serious this is ? You 've waived the right to an attorney . So if you lie to us here today , you could be charged with perjury . He promised me we 'd be in LA by Christmas . He had a friend there . And I 'd never seen the ocean . You said he and Ruby were seeing each other . You said they were planning to meet at the lake. ls that true ? Lookit , I was nowhere near the lake that night , OK ? Sure you were , Tessa . You knew they were meeting , so you sat and you waited for them . - You were angry and jealous . - l wasn 't . You waited , and when they showed you killed him first , isn 't that how it went ? - No . - You snuck up and you shot him in the back . Bam ! And then you killed Ruby . Bam ! What was she doin ' before she died ? Was she pleading for her life ? Was she running away ? I didn 't kill her ! - Where 's she buried ? - l don 't know ! - You don 't know where you buried her ? - l didn 't kill her ! - You didn 't ? - She wasn 't even there that night ! Well , how would you know that , Tessa , if you weren 't there yourself ? You 're not seeing the whole picture here . - Which is ? - Which is that in all likelihood Ruby is dead . is that your conclusion or the Sioux City Sheriffs Department 's ? They 're searching the National Park and a dive team is going to drag the lake . They 're wasting their time . Do you really think Tessa is telling the truth ? Why not ? What if Ruby never did show up that night ? She lied to us in the library and lied about her pregnancy . Why wouldn 't she lie about killing Ruby ? Because something was out there in those woods ! We have a suspect in custody . We have a confession to one murder and a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another . It 's over , Mulder. lt 's time to turn this over to local law enforcement . I can 't do that . - Mulder , where are you going ? - To talk to the boy . - Darlene won 't let you . - l 've gotta see him . They don 't want anything to do with us ! Mulder , stop ! Stop running after your sister . This won 't bring her back . Come with me or don 't , but until they find a body I 'm not giving up on that girl . Hello ? Mrs Morris ? Kevin ? Mulder ? What does it mean ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna check upstairs . Oh , my God ! What is it ? Just come up here . Look . It 's her ! It 's Ruby . This is a long shot . They could be anywhere . You know , when I was a kid I had this ritual . I 'd close my eyes before I walked into my room . Because I thought one day when I opened them my sister would be there . Just lying in bed ... like nothing ever happened . I 'm still walking into that room . Every day of my life . Scully ! Darlene ! Look , there 's a trailhead . - Are you OK ? - lt 's here. I saw it . - Where 's Kevin ? - l couldn 't keep up . Go ahead ! Kevin ! - Are you OK ? - She 's back ! Kevin , I 'm sorry , but ... She 's here. I know it ! Kevin , I don 't think she is . - l know you wanted it to be her. I did too . - Mulder ! Come on ! Scully ? Ruby ! She 's unconscious but alive . I 'll get help . She 's been awake for almost an hour . Any ideas what caused the coma ? No sign of head trauma , no narcotic traces or electrolyte abnormalities . But her white blood cell count was sky-high . Any attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or release of glucocorticoids ? Actually , both . How did you know that ? They 're symptoms of prolonged weightlessness . Shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances . Hi . Hi , Ruby . Who are you ? We 're with the FBl. I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder . My mom said you might be coming by . How are you feeling ? Fine , I guess . Where were you , Ruby ? Can you tell us ? It 's OK , Ruby . He knows . I 'm not supposed to tell . They told me not to say . Who told you ? Ruby , who told you ? Sweetheart , you don 't have to say anything . You 're right . We should wait till Ruby gets a little stronger . Can we speak outside for a moment ? I think that it 's best that we put all of this behind us . I mean , hasn 't Ruby been through enough already ? I know how disoriented she must seem right now . But in a couple of weeks , we ... I don 't want her talking to you . Or anyone . She should be encouraged to tell her story . It 's important that you let her . Important to who ? I have my daughter back . I don 't want more trouble . Besides , she can 't remember anything . But she will remember one day , even if it 's only in dreams . When she does , she 'll want to talk about it . She 'll need to talk about it . Like I did ? Listen to me . I have been ridiculed for speaking my mind . But it was the truth , Darlene . It 's caused me nothing but heartache . I don 't want the same thing for her . It doesn 't have to be that way for Ruby . As far as I know , she spent the last month on the back of a Harley-Davidson . is that what you 'll tell Kevin ? I 'm sorry . - Your eyes are open ? - Yeah , but it 's like - nothing 's happening . - Try turning your head . I can 't . - Why not ? - l don 't know . I can 't move . So I don 't . - l just lie there in bed . - Can you see your sister ? No . But I can hear her . - What does she say ? - She 's calling out my name over and over again . She 's crying out for help . But I can 't help her . I can 't move . - Are you scared ? - l know I should be , but I 'm not . - Do you know why ? - Because of the voice . - The voice ? - The voice in my head . - What 's it telling you ? - Not to be afraid . It 's telling me that no harm will come to her . And that one day she 'll return . Do you believe the voice ? I want to believe . I want to believe .

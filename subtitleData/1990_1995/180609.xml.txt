 [ Chattering ] [ Whirring ] Two degrees Celsius . It dropped two degrees since yesterday . Well , hopefully it will warm up a bit by midmorning . Anybody miss the space stations yet ? Twenty-eight degrees Celsius year round . I never knew what cold actually felt like . My sleeping bag had ice on it this morning . [ Walman ] Hey , Danziger 's back . [ Devon ] Let 's see what he found . Here you go , Dad . Thanks . It 's worse to the south . Higher elevations . No place to hide in the wind . And the snow 's already about a meter deep . Try southwest . Don 't get too far ahead of us . If that storm blows in , it could be serious . Alonzo - [ Sighs ] Did you have any more dreams last night ? Same thing . The Terrians showed me a night sky - two full moons crossing . And they asked if our boy is ready . Ready for what ? They don 't say . Be careful . [ Vehicle Departing ] [ Alonzo Narrating ] Day 61 on the new planet . I knew Devon was worried about the Terrians ... and what they had in mind for her son . But I wasn 't concerned right then about alien species . At the moment , I thought our worst enemy was winter . As usual , I was wrong . Come on , Uly . Up and at ' em . But it 's too cold . [ Sighs ] It 'll warm up once you start moving around , okay ? We have to pack up . Find a good place to camp for winter . No , we don 't . Yes , we do . We 're staying here . That wouldn 't be a very good idea , Uly . When the snow blows in , we 'll have no protection here . We 'll be safe in the garden . What garden ? Mary 's garden . - It 's warm there . - What are you talking about , Uly ? I 'll show you . Uly - Uly , wait . Ul - Uly ! Uly ! Uly , what are you doing ? Showing you where we 'll camp . Where are you going ? Uly . Look ! What 're you - [ Gasps ] Anybody home ? I 'd say nobody 's been home for years . Come on , Dad ! [ Uly ] It 's nice inside . Uly , stay close . Dad , it 's hot in here . [ Chattering ] [ Man ] Here . Take that corner . [ Man ] Yeah . [ Beeping ] [ Electronics Whirring ] Yeah . That 's fine . Just leave it . Danziger . Yeah ? What do you think ? Could this have been built by penal colonists ? [ Sighs ] Well , whoever they were , they sure knew what they were doing . This whole sphere 's been on a self-perpetuating cycle for 15 , maybe 20 years . What about the occupants ? [ Sighs ] I don 't know . Maybe Yale could do a search for that logo . John , come look . We found the pieces to more prefab structures , some cold weather clothes . Oh , boy , this place is looking better and better . An ideal camp . Yeah . Just when we needed it . He 'll be back soon . Alonzo . What ? Are we all supposed to pretend we haven 't noticed ? What about toxicity ? So far this dome seems perfectly habitable . [ Sighs ] How did Uly know about it ? I don 't know . I can 't get a straight answer . Did it have to do with the Terrians ? How they 've changed him genetically ? Look , the Terrians got what we promised them . They healed Uly , and we helped them get rid of Gaal . They have no right to expect anything else from us . So , are we gonna stay here ? I think so . At least until the weather changes . You were very lucky to find this place . What did you call it ? Uh , Mary 's garden ? Mm-hmm . Where did you get that name ? I don 't know . [ Sighs ] Uly , when we first landed here , and the Terrians took you - When they made me well ? Yeah . I know we 've talked before about that night . I told you . I woke up , and I was in a cave . And Mr. Danziger came and got me . But you d-you did say that ... you remembered at one point you were in the ground . Oh , yeah . The Terrians were all around me , and I was sort of getting buried . That must have been scary . It was fun . I wanted to stay . You did ? Yeah , but they said it wasn 't the right time . I had to come back . When ? When were you supposed to come back ? [ Moaning , Distant ] [ Moaning Continues ] [ Creaking ] [ Child 's Voice ] Mama . Mama . - " [ Terrians Growling ] " - " [ Child 's Voice ] Mama . ! " Mama . ! [ Child Whimpers ] [ Devon Sighs ] [ Clattering ] [ Gasps ] [ Uly ] Mom ? You okay ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to frighten you . It 's okay . Uly , what are you doing ? I woke up . I think I was thirsty . Why were you up there ? I , uh - [ Sighs ] I thought I heard something . Come on . Let 's , uh - Let 's go get you something to drink , okay ? [ Growling ] [ Groaning ] What are you doing ? Let me go . ! Thanks . [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] [ Trilling ] [ Murmuring ] [ Terrians Murmuring ] What are you doing ? [ Woman 's Voice ] Saving you . [ Alonzo ] Who are you ? [ Sighs ] How did you get here ? What am I doing here ? Who are you ? Don 't talk . Dream . Why did you attack me ? [ Woman ] We didn 't . They were outcasts . [ Alonzo ] Outcasts ? What does that mean ? Is this about Uly ? [ Gasps ] [ Murmuring ] [ Murmuring ] [ Alonzo Narrating ] It wasn 't until later that I realized ... this was what I had been dreaming about - Moon Cross . It was a special season when Terrians perform a ritual ... they called " going in . ' " Going back to the earth . What we call dying , I guess . But to them , it was heaven . [ Woman Trilling ] So what if the outcasts are coming ? No . I dreamt with you . Now you talk to me . Why should I help ? Tell me . Outcasts ... will kill you . What about them ? Can they help ? Moon Cross . Moon Cross ? [ Man ] Here . [ Grunts ] Yale ? Yale , are you okay ? Yale , are you okay ? I guess I could ask you the same . Yeah . Well I , uh - I certainly didn 't sleep very well last night . [ Sighs ] Yale , I know that this place seems like a good place to bunker down for the bad weather - [ Uly ] That 's cheating . ! [ True ] No , it 's not . I got you . Did not . Hey , guys ! You 're it . You 're it . I was just it . Yeah , and you didn 't find me . So you 're it again . Hey ! Hey , kids , what 's the problem ? It 's my turn to hide . No , it isn 't ! Tell you what . Why don 't you both hide , and I 'll seek , okay ? All right . I 'll count to 50 . Ready , go ! [ Counting Rapidly ] [ Groans ] Hurry up ! Let 's hide . [ Uly ] Me first ! Oh , my God . Yale , what is it ? [ Sighs ] What is it ? I was trying to - to search my mental files ... for some reference to this structure 's trademark . I must have triggered an aversion mechanism - gave myself quite a shock . Yale , there are certain parts of history you 're blocked from referencing ? I guess I would be discouraged from inquiring about events that overlap in my own past , to prevent me from discovering my pre-wash identity . Devon , the children . Forty-eight , 49 - Fifty ! I 'm coming . [ Terrians Murmuring ] I can 't fire one of these . [ Murmuring ] [ Murmuring Continues ] [ Groaning ] Are they dead ? They are not dead . Th-Th-They cannot go in . Go in what ? That pool in there ? Because they 're outcasts . What did they do wrong ? You ask so much . Because I 'm human , just like you are . [ Trilling ] Yes , you are . Gotcha . Come on . Let 's go find True . Okay . I 'll find her . [ Girl Crying , Distant ] - " [ Woman 's Voice ] Mary ? " - [ Gasps ] Mary , where are you ? [ Gasps ] You gave it away , True . I could hear you breathing . You could not ! Yes , I could . [ True ] She found you first . [ Alonzo Narrating ] It took a few trips to the dream plane , but I got her to explain that these outcasts ... wouldn 't be a threat until midnight , when the two moons would rise . Whatever crime they had committed , it was so heinous they had been banished ... and forbidden from going into the pool . They were sentenced to life without death , so to speak . And it had driven these outcasts to more and more violence . Now you go . Get your boy . Bring Uly here ? His mother might have something to say about that . This is his mother . [ Sighs ] Do you want to tell Devon that yourself ? Come on . You can come back with me . [ Trilling ] You might like it better than you think . No . We sleep now ... until the m-moon comes up again . So , now everyone rests ? And you do too . Because you 're one of them , almost . You must have noticed , you 're different . You know how to speak . You got these clothes somewhere . Do you go into that pool in there ? What are you doin ' ? [ Alonzo Narrating ] I can 't explain the feeling that came over me in that Terrian bed , but it 's the closest thing to flying I 've ever felt . It helped me later , to understand her . Why she did what she had to do . [ Sighs ] Okay . You made your point . It 's not half bad here . [ Sighs ] But if you 've got something to tell my people - Maybe it 's time you met them . If you think I 'm interesting , wait until you see them . Back by Moon Cross ? No problem . It is long walk ? We don 't have to walk . No , it 's okay . It won 't bite . [ Sighs ] Now , you can come here and sit down right here . It 's all right . Just like that . Just put your feet out . Right . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Now , you want to hold on . Hold on . [ Whirring ] [ Woman 's Voice ] I 'm telling you . They want her . [ Man 's Voice ] Mary ? Mary . ! [ Woman 's Voice ] They want to take my child . Wait . Wait ! [ Woman 's Voice ] No . ! Not my baby . ! [ Gasps ] Devon , you all right ? Danziger , th-there 's something wrong with this place . Something terrible must have happened here . You 're right . Come see what we found . We were clearing out some dead vines and we found them . [ Alonzo Narrating ] It was hard to say what this woman was . I mean , she was a woman . That was obvious . But she also was part child , part Terrian , part wild animal . It wasn 't going to be easy to introduce her to civilization , but I had to try . Uh , I need a break , so - Um , I 'm gonna go stretch my legs , okay ? What i-is this ? This ? Uh , it 's called , uh , hugging and , uh - and touching . People - men and women , uh , do this when they know each other better . This is - is h-human ? This feeling ? Uh - Uh - Uh , yeah . Um , and - [ Clears Throat ] People limit this to , uh , their friends and their family , you know ? M - My family d-does not touch . Well , th-the Terrians don 't . What about your - your real family ? Your father and your mother ? [ Trilling ] What about them ? Where are they ? [ Trilling ] Terrians are my family . She understands us ? [ Alonzo ] Yeah . Do you need a coat ? [ Trilling ] It 's okay . She 's a little shy right now , okay ? And this little thing " saved " you " from renegade Terrians ? " - Yeah . - Well , it looks like she can handle that stick pretty well . She says she needs to talk to us about Uly . What about Uly ? What-What do you want ? It 's okay . Settle down . It 's all right . [ Trills ] Hello there . I bet I know something you 'd really like . [ Trilling ] Come here . It 's okay . Told you you 'd like it . Now let me get your back . Hey , stop that . This is for your own good . Haven 't you ever had a bath before ? [ Trills ] It 's okay . We , uh - We 've rounded up some clothes that I think should fit you . And , uh , this is Julia . She 's our doctor , and she 's going to examine you ... as soon as you 've finished your bath . I 'm just gonna touch you with this glove . It 's gonna tell me all about your health . [ Glove Whirring ] Touch . Alonzo show - show me touching . You know , um , we don 't know what to call you . How about Mary ? Look . This is you . Mary . Other people lived here before . We don 't know who they were or what happened to them . Maybe you do . [ Devon ] She must be connected somehow ... to whatever happened here with the original settlers , I just know it . They were a group of radical biologists . They were outlawed on the stations for proposing domes like this one ... to preserve botanical species from Earth . Yale , what is it ? Devon , this wasn 't from my files . This must be memory . [ Devon Sighs ] It 's not as pronounced as Uly 's change , but her D.N.A. has been altered . If she was an early attempt at assimilation , they 've improved their technique . Well , what does she want ? Biologically , she 's human . Socially , she 's bonded to the Terrians . Although I 'm sure that we could nurture her human side . Devon , you always trusted the Terrians . It seems the more we trust them , the more they want from us . Devon ! Devon , you better come see this . Did it hurt ? Only a little , like you said . Uly-Aaah ! What 're you doing with that thing , Uly ? Learning to stop outcasts . You will never touch that thing again . Do you understand me ? He needs to learn , to join us . Uly is not joining anything . He has to . It is Moon Cross now . It is time for him to go in . That is why I came , to get him . Get him ? You are not taking my son anywhere . Let 's hear her out . Let 's just all sit down and hear what she has to say . Oh , she 's welcome to say whatever she 'd like . But you will never take my son . Do you understand that ? [ Trilling ] Mom ! Let her go . Let her go . What did she say ? She called you a human . [ Uly ] How could I shoot like that , Mom ? How could I do that ? I don 't know . I liked her - Mary . Didn 't you ? I didn 't like her wanting to take you . But she was right , what she was thinking . And what was that ? You know , Mom , it 's all going to be all right . I promise . Look , it 's bedtime , Uly . Why don 't you go get some sleep , okay ? [ Sighs ] [ Trilling ] [ Woman 's Voice ] Mary ? Mary ? Mary , where are you ? [ Mary ] Mama ? Mama ? [ Woman 's Voice ] Mary ? Baby ? [ Woman Shouting ] No . ! [ Mary ] Mama . Don 't be scared . I-I 'm right here . Shh . Shh . She was worried about me . Now she knows I 'm all right . I know . I know . Do you remember ? You used to live here . I don 't know . You were a little girl , and your parents fought with the Terrians . No . At first , w - we were all friends . Then one day , my mama told me I had to stay away . I must have been little . I remember , I was learning ... how to - to read . And then one night ... they came to get you . They broke in . That 's what they did . The outcasts . They killed my mama and daddy . [ Crying ] Alonzo . [ Whimpers ] It 's okay , Mary . You 're crying . Hey , it 's what humans do . So the Terrians punished the outcasts , and they adopted you . Th-The tribe ... didn 't want anyone hurt . I know . Please , let your boy go so it doesn 't happen again . [ Yale ] Devon . ! It 's Uly . He 's gone . He took the A.T.V. He doesn 't have lightning . [ Uly ] Vehicle , halt . Vehicle , confirm . Previous trip reversed ? [ Beeping ] [ Terrians Murmuring ] [ Growling ] - [ Trilling ] - What 's happening ? He 's telling the tribe to let them pass . [ Trilling Continues ] [ Mary ] It 's time for the outcasts to be forgiven . [ Murmuring ] [ Trilling ] [ Trilling Continues ] [ Mary ] It 's over now , he says . They can stop fighting . [ Sighs ] Uly . And Moon Cross is over . What 's happening ? Did the Terrians help me again ? [ Sighs ] Actually , you helped the Terrians . You helped all of us . [ Alonzo Narrating ] So , a small boy was initiated as the link between two species . And he brought peace to the Terrians . And a mother 's fears were calmed . For now , Uly would only be changed at Moon Cross . Dream . And Mary showed me , in a dream , why she had not become the Terrians 'human link ... when they had taken her in . Mary hadn 't only lost her parents , she had lost her connection to all humans . Orphaned , she 'd become too much like the Terrians ... and couldn 't be a link to humans . You 're not an orphan anymore , Mary . Don 't go . Come with me . This is my family . I 'm home . [ Alonzo Narrating ] We took comfort in knowing that in seeing Mary , the spirits ofher father and mother finally rested . The outcast Terrians who had slaughtered them ... could also finally rest . And the chance for making a better home was where it belonged - in the hands of all living species who share this second Earth . [ Narrator ] " Next on " Earth 2 . I 'm a Yale series tutor , an artificially rehabilitated criminal like all the others . I know you , Yale ! You are a good man . [ Bess Narrating ] Almost all the ex-convicts inducted into the Yale program ... have mindwash failure before the recall . Oh - I am not gonna line Yale up and shoot him down like a rabid animal . - " I am not . ! " - " The Yales that they didn 't catch " in time became rabid animals . [ Grunting ]

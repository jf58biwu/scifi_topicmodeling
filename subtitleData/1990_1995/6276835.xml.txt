 Eat napalm , fish breath . It burns underwater . Incoming . Yow ! Looks like Namor got himself a date for the party . That means it 's clobberin ' time ! Fantastic . And I mean that in the most respectful sense of the word . But I think what telethon viewers really want to know is how you got your fantastic powers . The whole story is here in our book , Dick . We wrote it just for your telethon to raise scholarship money for State University , Reed 's alma mater . The intrinsic value of a college education ... Hey ! Education 's a good cause . So you out there , get on the phones and start buying books before I get steamed . That 's a real smooth pitch , Ben . Hey , don 't get cute with me , you walking hotfoot . Hey , guys . The origin of your powers , please . I wanna see some bread first . Will you cool it , Ben ? Hmm . Oh , okay . But I 'd better hear a whole mess of ringy-dingies . Well , Dick , our story begins several years back in my lab when an amazing phenomena came streaking into our galaxy . Are you kidding ? I seen wilder stuff at Captain Louie 's Video Arcade . It appears to be moving faster than the speed of light . But that 's impossible . Isn 't it , Sis ? I must evaluate it at closer range . But , Reed , sweetheart , wait . Whatever this streaking phenomenon is it may pose a threat to the Earth . You 're my husband . I can 't let you go alone . Me either , Brain-O , 'cause you 're no pilot . And I still don 't like it . Your new doohickey hasn 't even been road-tested . Besides which , you got no shieldin' for cosmic ray protection . Recent data indicate no negative effects from exposure to cosmic rays . However , actinic solar rays do have cumulative injurious effects ... Okay , all right , all right . But just promise not to explain everything when we 're up there . - All systems on-line . - Brace for blastoff . On five , four , three , two ... If my calculations are correct our flight path will intersect with the phenomenon 's trajectory ... Now . We didn 't know it then but the phenomenon had disrupted an unknown energy field and that occurrence mysteriously altered normally harmless cosmic rays ... Cosmic rays ? Yeah . I , I tried to warn him , but , oh , would he listen to me ? - Oh , no . - Ben , we 're on televisi√≥n . I know . It still steams my clams . I mean , the world 's greatest scientist . He didn 't know beans about them cosmic ... Thing . Er , Mr. Grimm , please . I 'd really like to get back to your story . Yeah , whatever you say , Dick . What happened next was incredibly frightening and amazing . Reed , Johnny 's on fire . I can 't let go . But it ... it doesn 't hurt . I 'm coming , Johnny . - Oh . - Sue , darling ! You 've got to get out from under before it collapses . I , I can 't . You 've got to try , darling . If I could just reach ... Your hand . I can 't reach that far . When I lift it , you both run for it , okay ? All right . Ready ... Set ... By all rights , we should 've been finished but then miraculously , the autopilot kicked in . We all survived . Oh , darling . - Johnny , Ben . - Yeah , we made it . But it was just dumb luck , if you ask me . Whatever it was , we 're here . We 're all alive . But we would soon find out that things would never be the same . We 'll be right back after this important and extremely commercial message . Welcome back , friends , this is Gary Owens and we just passed the $ 1.5 million plateau . Truly a fantastic tribute to the Fantastic Four . Oh , yeah , Mr. Hands-Over-Your-Ears ? It ain 't good enough . On the contrary , I think it 's great . " I think it 's great . " Great , schmate . D 'you know what education costs these days ? Hey , you folks out there . You better get back on them phones and start kicking in some real dough ... - Or we 're walkin ' . - We will do no such thing . While the Fantastic Four have a little heart-to-heart chat here 's the world 's greatest dog act : Fritz and Cootie . A dog act ? All right , pick it up , Reed . You were saying how we survived the crash . While we failed to unlock the secret of the streaking phenomenon at least we were all still there to talk about it . And then ... Just as I was saying . But we still don 't know if there 'll be aftereffects from the flight . I ... I feel so strange . Huh ? What ? Hey , you 're not gonna throw up , are you ? - Sue ! - Sis ! She ... She 's fading away . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Oh . Reed ? - Reed . - Sue , speak to us . What happened to me ? The streaking phenomenon must have destabilized the cosmic rays and altered your atomic structure , making you invis ... Uh . - Invisible . - Oh , sweetheart . No . How long will I be this way ? I ... There 's no way of knowing . But what if she never gets visible again ? No . Hey , look , everybody , she 's coming back . I did it myself . Just by thinking about it . Oh , thank heavens you 're all right . All right ? Huh . How do you know she won 't turn invisible again ? How do you know that something even more rotten ain 't gonna happen to the rest of us ? I don 't . No one does . Scientific exploration is dangerous . Stop trying to talk your way out of this . You were too big-headed to try and listen when I warned you . Now it 's time you learned a lesson . He 's turned into a thing . Batter up ! No , Ben , stop and think . You 've got to think about it . Think , Ben ! Okay ... I think you need clobberin ' . What 's with this stretcho jazz ? What 's goin ' on ? What 's happened to us all ? Those cosmic rays turned you into monsters . It 's makin ' me crazy . I mean ... No wonder I 've been feeling warm and funny . I 'm changed too . Whoa ! Wh ... I can fly ! Whoa ! Oh . Oh , man , that was fantastic . You can say that again , Mr. Blowtorch . You better chill out . Together , we have more power than four beings have ever possessed . Oh , stand back , folks , here it comes . I suppose you 're gonna give us some sheep-dip about using our powers " for the good of mankind . " Right ? - Right ? - Right , Ben . Absolutely right . I 'm gonna call myself ... The Human Torch . And I 'll be with you as The Invisible Woman . Oh , and maybe you should call yourself Mr. Fantastic . Well , er , rather presumptuous but it does have a ring to it . Mr. Fantastic , it is . One of us is missing . Ben ? Er , ... I 'm in , but I ... I ain 't Ben no more . Look ... Like Sue said now I 'm just a muscle-bound Thing . But things weren 't easy for us , Dick . Wait till I get my violin before I start sobbing . When we started , not many New York apartment buildings were eager to have us as tenants . Then it 's the four of you , Professor Richards . You , your wife , your brother-in-law , John M. Storm ... Ah , that 's just " Johnny . " And Benjamin J. Grimm . What is your relation to the others , may I ask ? Er , none of your business , I may answer . Yes , of course . Now , then , about your experiments , professor . They won 't be dangerous , noisy or smelly , will they ? Hey . I 'm dangerous , noisy and smelly . You don 't like it ? What am I supposed to do ? Sleep in the park ? Hey , for the rent you 're charging us you shouldn 't care if we 're breeding hogs in here . - You 're rude . Very rude . - Oh , yeah ? You 're a dingbat ! The rent is high , Ben , but you must admit that we 're rather , er , unusual tenants . Now , we have some shopping to do and , er , ... What are you doing ? I 'm making a grilled cheese sandwich . We do our cooking in the kitchen . Darling , did I hear you say " shopping " ? And so we went out little dreaming we were heading into our very first strange adventure as the Fantastic Four . - Vos vas dos , Harold ? - You got me , Maurice . Guys , look . Somebody has to save him . The police can 't get close enough . Witnesses report the young man seems to be in some sort of trance no one knows the identity ... Identity indeed . He 's nothing . A mere nobody I observed on the subway one day . But now I have crafted his likeness in my special neuro-kinetic clay he 's mine to control . Can 't reach . It 's just ... Too far . It can 't be ! Someone whose power is greater than mine . This may burn , but it 's better than going splat . Stop ! Only I control the destiny of my living puppets . The flames . Father ! I heard you cry out in pain . - How did you burn yourself ? - No , don 't call me " Father . " How many times must I remind you ? I 'm your stepfather . You 're no child of mine . I want to help you if you 've been hurt . You 're blocking my view , Alicia . You may be blind , but I can see perfectly . What are you doing ? Detour , buddy . I got a friend coming in for a landing . No one must steal my power ! My glory ! Almost 3 million and climbing . Let 's hear it . Okay , Dick . We 're doing better . But now I 'm gonna put us over the top . All right , ya gonzos ! I 'm gonna give the first hundred of you coach potatoes that pledge a thousand bucks or more my personal body building lessons absolutely free . One , two five , six . No bully 's gonna kick sand in your face when yours truly gets done . Put biceps on your triceps in only ten quick steps . Kill camera two . Camera four on Reed . Now , Reed , you were telling us about the Puppet Master . We had no idea what a cunning and desperate adversary he 'd prove to be . His grasp of strange science was as startling as it was dangerous . Careful . Mustn 't overfill the matrix . Yes . Whoever , and whatever , you are you shall be the first to serve me . And through you ... I shall conquer and control your powerful friends . There . Now no force on earth can prevent you from coming to me . Your new master . Come , my puppet . Come . Uh . Come on , let me in , Reed . I wanna see what you 're workin ' on . Come to me . - Now . - Uh ? I said I 'm not really ready to show this particular experiment to visitors , Ben . Hey , who 's a visitor ? I 'm one of the Fantastic Four , ain 't I ? Come . Well , there 's no need to be offended . I 'd better keep an eye on him . If he saw you and Johnny trailing him , he 'd be furious . Be careful , Sue . Uh , Sue , darling ? She 's gone , Reed . At least I think she is . It 's kinda tough to tell , when your sister 's invisible . How many times have I told you ? Don 't play with fire in the house . Well , excuse me . He 's heading into a house on Sullivan Street and I don 't wanna lose him . I 'll be in touch . I 've been expecting you . Come to me . What is it , Stepfather ? Do we have guests ? Only one guest , Alicia . Do make him comfortable . Good afternoon , I 'm Alicia Masters . And your name is ? That 's not important . What a strong , gentle man you are . With a strange sadness ... I can feel in my heart . Oh , hello . Your other guest has arrived , Stepfather . You 're imagining things , girl . No , I 'm not . I can sense her presence . Yes , her . I feel sure it 's a woman . You 're indoors too much , Alicia . Your mind is playing tricks . I long ago learned to trust your instincts . If we do have an uninvited guest this sleep gas will deal with her . There is someone after all . Good work , Alicia . I don 't understand . Why are you using sleep gas to greet someone ? I must try to stay awake now . Let me think ... Call ... Reed . J - Johnny ... That woman was on televisi√≥n with our other guest earlier today . What a delightful development . I could not have planned it better . You 're scaring me , Stepfather . - What 's happening ? - Stop your prattling , girl . I 'm trying to think . Yes . The resemblance is uncanny . It shall be no problem for the Puppet Master . Come , I have work for you . There , my child . You will at last pay your debt to me for caring for you when your mother ran away from me in fear and loathing . Too terrified to even return for you . Excellent . Only two things more . Your eyes , girl . Open your eyes . The contact lenses are perfect . Now , put on her clothes , Alicia . Quickly ! My stepdaughter 's presence at your side will convince the flaming torch and the man who stretches that their friends have returned . When they let you in destroy them . I 'm ready , Stepfather but I don 't understand the purpose of this masquerade . It 's a friendly joke , child . You said you could sense my guest 's goodness . Would he ever engage in wrongdoing ? No , of course not . Then go . Now ... My great work begins . Once my obedient puppet has destroyed his powerful friends ... I will activate my criminal army and quickly terrorize and dominate the city . I shall be master ! Master ! Anyone I wish ! ... tomorrow 's telecast for the rest of the story of the origin of the Fantastic Four . To be continued . And keep them calls coming in . Or else .

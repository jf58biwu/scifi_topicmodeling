 [ engine fires up ] ¶ On an outer space adventure ¶ They got hit by cosmic rays ¶ And the four were changed forever ¶ In some most fantastic ways ¶ No need to fear , they 're here ¶ Just call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four - ¶ Don 't need no more - ¶ That 's ungrammatical ¶ Reed Richards is elastic ¶ Sue can fade from sight ¶ Johnny is the Human Torch ¶ The Thing just loves to fight ¶ Call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four Come , lightning ! Bring life to my creation . Strike ! Strike ! Live ! Live , I say ! No , Helmut , you 've gone mad ! Silence , woman ! Nothing must stand in the way of science ! Not even our love ! [ hiss of steam ] [ ominous organ music ] That yutz sounds just like Stretcho . It lives ! [ growls ] Rosebud ! - Cool ! - This sucks ! [ heavy rock ] No , that sucks , Beavis . No , that sucks ! [ gasps ] Helmut , help ! Back , back , I say ! [ growls ] Rosebud ! Good ! - Give me that ! - Get lost , you walking barbecue pit ! Yeow ! Hey , whoa , whoa ! No fair , flaming up . Hey , what are you doing , matcho ? I wanna watch my flick ! - And I wanna see my program ! - Get lost ! - No , no ! - Gimme that ! Let go ! Ah , why did I eat those last four pizzas ? Man , that 's smooth . [ burps ] - Now what 's with the tube ? - Nothing . One of the Big Brain 's experiments must 've fried the circuits again . I 'm tired of him messing up our viewing pleasure . Yeah , well , I 'm with you , little buddy . [ electronic reverberations ] Hey , Volto , you killed the TV again . Right in the middle of our favorite program . I 'm using a high-frequency bio-sweep to locate alien life in the galaxy . I 'm afraid that 's what caused your power outage . Er , would you run that by me again , in English ? I was sure I 'd detected life on planet clusters , here , here and here . But then , one after the other , they seemed to die , as if their life-force had been drained , and , of course , by then ... Ben , look ! [ electronic pulse ] [ Ben ] It 's the watchamacallit ! The streaking phenomenon that moves faster than light . It 's back ! Hey , don 't count on me chasing after it again . Last time we tried that , them cosmic rays turned God 's gift to woman here into an ever lovin ' , blue-eyed thing . Yeah , right . I 'm out too . No need to worry . Pursuing it now would serve no purpose . It 's circling the far periphery of our universe and ... Reed , Ben , Johnny , we 've got a problem . No problem , sweetheart . We 'll have TV reception restored in a moment . It 's not the TV , darling . It 's the management and tenants of this building . They want to kick us out . I believe you to be a cultured , rational person . Your husband , on the other hand , seems determined to use his experiments to turn this building into a smoking , radioactive ruin . And your brother ... Stop playing with fire when I 'm speaking to you . - [ Sue ] Johnny ! - Which brings me to your star boarder . Benjamin J. Grimm . No , no , don 't you sit in my Queen Anne chair . Why not ? She ain 't using it . Well , I have nothing more to say . A process server will present you with formal eviction papers within the hour . Naturally , you may appeal , but I am confident no judge will ... Reed , everybody , look ! The sky 's on fire ! Ha , ha , ha ! Warned ya ! Did I warn ya ? Call a cop , somebody , call anybody ! Incredible ! We 've got to do something before the city is incinerated . Don 't think I 'll delay the eviction process . Judging from the color of the flame , I 'd estimate a temperature of more than 600 degrees Fahrenheit . - Hot , right ? - Extremely . [ Ben ] Then why didn 't you say that ? [ Ben ] This ain 't the sky no more . It 's a flying barbecue . - Hang on to your socks ! - Secure for individual reconnaissance . - Roger . - All secured . Ditto . Then prepare to disengage . [ roar of rockets ] Sampling fire for analysis . Fire 's no big deal for me ! I 'm gonna take it on face to face ! [ woman 's voice ] Your auto-pilot is now employed . Ha , ha ! Thanks , babe . Flame on ! Yeehah ! [ whooshing ] Knock it off , will ya , you half-baked hotshot . - This ain 't no game . - Ben , look out ! No , you look out ! [ Ben ] Whoa , mama ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Ben ! - Oh , no ! Ben ! What the ... Hey , hoo hoo ! What was that ? That meteor had no effect on Ben . Reed , I 'm going to try it . Sue , no ! If the flames are a multi-form phenomenon , Ben could 've passed through a cold phase . But you could be flying into temperatures hotter than molten lava . [ Ben ] I hope not . Well done , Suzy ! Reed , there 's no heat in the flames . Thank heaven . That 's because they 're not flames at all . They 're an unknown form of highly evolved holograms . But who 's got energy powerful enough to generate a sky full of holograms ? - [ thunderclap ] - Uh-oh . Rain cloud ! [ rocket whoosh ] Aghh ! Reed , flame out ! Johnny ! Here ! Yah ! Ooof ! Just don 't get fresh or I 'll make you walk home . What ? ! - [ meteors whoosh ] - [ Ben ] The fire 's gone bye-bye . More puzzling still , our intruder alert indicates that an immaterial presence has entered our laboratory at the Baxter Building . How did it get in without setting off our security protocols ? Merge positions . Whatever it is , our sensors show it to be enormous , but weightless . Unify ! Our unknown caller has no mass or molecular composition . [ Ben ] Yeah , whoever busted in is gonna get a busted schnoz . [ electronic pulsing ] [ man ] You are no longer alone . I have come on a missión of gravest consequence . Should I punch him out , Stretcho ? - No , wait . - Hear me . You are about to die . That sinks it ! You 're high , I 'm low . Go for it ! - Deck the sucker ! - [ Ben ] It 's clobberin ' time ! [ Reed ] No , let him speak . You are wise , Reed Richards , for I am The Watcher , member of an ancient race far older than man . Look . From our far planet , my people watched countless worlds evolve over eons of what you call time . Some for good , others for evil . Some so debased by war , greed and hatred that they descended into savagery . But though our power is great , we are pledged only to watch . Never to interfere . Hey , you talk about weird . Sheesh ! But now mankind faces the greatest danger it has ever known . The danger of total extinction . [ Ben ] Look out ! Hey , he 's got a gizmo ! [ Johnny ] Wax him , Reed ! And though I may not act directly in your behalf , I have come to warn you . For I cannot let this world be obliterated . I caused the flame and meteors to appear in your sky with my Matter Mobilizer . Incredible ! It utilizes magnetic energy to generate molecular bonding . I 'm all choked up . Hey , would you stop lecturing and get us down ? Huh ? [ electronic buzz ] The flaming sky you created with your Matter Mobilizer terrified people . That was not my intention . My sole purpose was simply to conceal the Earth from him . Him ? Him who ? Galactus , Devourer of Worids ! Look ! With his awesome power , Galactus roams the cosmos seeking planets which contain an abundance of life . For without such nourishment , he would perish . Once he has absorbed the planet 's life 's energy into his own body , the planet is left barren and lifeless . Then , when the hunger is again upon him , his endless voyage begins anew . [ sucking ] Your only hope is that his herald , the one who searches the cosmos for planets such as this , does not see your Earth . He is known as the Silver Surfer . A tortured soul forced to serve his merciless master throughout eternity . [ Johnny ] A high-flying surfer dude . Truly far out . [ rock 'n'roll-style music ] I must blind him to the profusión of life on your planet before it 's too late . [ car horn ] [ roar of meteor storm ] [ Watcher ] The screen is in place . Let us pray it will discourage the Surfer from looking too closely . [ police sirens ] [ man ] First fire , now boulders ? [ rock 'n'roll-style music ] [ whoosh of meteors ] [ Silver Surfer ] Whoa ! [ climactic whoosh ] Ah , such life , such energy . - Galactus shall feast as never before . - [ Reed ] The galaxy scanner ! The Silver Surfer is directly overhead . [ Watcher ] Quickly ! He must be intercepted before he signals his master or all will be lost . Hurry , you still have time . Disengage . [ Ben ] Look out , Silverfish ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Yeeow ! Suzy , catch me ! [ Watcher ] We are too late . - [ high-pitched whirring ] - [ Silver Surfer ] Hyperion ! [ Watcher ] The Hyper Space Signal . It will inform Galactus of his discovery . Nobody likes a squealer ! - Yaaah ! - Ugghh ! No more Mr. Nice Guy . He will return . No fall can injure the Silver Surfer . Your true concern is Galactus . - [ roar of engines ] - [ woman ] Look up in the sky ! I heard of flying saucers , but that 's ridiculous . [ engine roars ] Shouldn 't someone call the cops or something ? [ eerie electronic chime , hissing ] [ Reed ] That aura . What did you just do ? I have screened Galactus and his sphere from the view of the terrified populace . Wait a second ! I could 've sworn there was a giant silver ball . [ electronic pulses ] [ reverberating footfalls ] My journey has ended . At last , I have found what I seek . For the great hunger is upon me ! Such an abundance of elemental life energy . I shall feast as never before . [ whirring ] - [ metallic clunk ] - Wow , what 's he doing ? Assembling his Elemental Converter . The device with which he will drain your planet of its very life . Not today , he ain 't . Hey ! I want to know more about our adversary before we commit to action . Galactus must 've seen us . Why didn 't he say anything ? Do you greet the cockroaches on your kitchen floor ? We do not have roaches . To Galactus , you are lesser beings . As low on the evolutionary scale and as meaningless as insects . Insects ! Galacticus , Shmalacticus ! He ain 't gettin ' rid of Mama Grimm 's baby boy so easy . Piece of cake . We can 't wait any longer . Ben was right . If we 're to have any chance of saving the Earth , we must take action now . [ screeching ] Wait ! There may be another way . I shall communicate with him . But you said you were forbidden to act . Contrary to the fond belief of many , talk is not action . Hear me , Galactus ! Who are you who callously speaks my name ? I am Uatu , The Watcher . I know what you are about to do , and I speak for Planet Earth . This lush world needs no spokesman . It must appease my gnawing hunger . Wait , open your mind , that you may share my thoughts . [ eerie electronic pulse ] [ electric crackling ] [ Reed ] They 're exchanging the contents of their minds . Stop right where you are , Benjamin J. Grimm . - [ bark ] - There , Mr. Sully . Ah , yes , Benjamin J. Grimm , you are hereby served with official notice of eviction , and , er ... huh ? [ grunts ] Delicious ! Hey , didn 't need no mayo nor nothing . [ electronic pulsing ] So you see , there are billions of people here on Earth . Plus teeming animal life . Hmmm , true , Watcher . That is why it shall be such a satisfying feast . But these lives have intelligence , souls meaning . I have no wish to harm any species . Oh , darling , Earth will be safe . Yet if my hunger is not appeased , I die . And I do not wish to die . It is my destiny to be Galactus . I must do what I was born to do . [ thunderclap ] And the same thing goes for me , oversized cornball . One for the money , two for the show , you 're gonna get it , you big , dumb schmo . [ Sue ] Get away from him , Ben . [ Johnny ] Look out ! Who do you think you 're messing with , you king-sized clown ? [ hiss ] Hold your breath ! As near as I can figure , he 's using some sort of cosmic insecticide . Insecticide ! Do you mean to tell me , as far as that fender-head is concerned , I ain 't nothing but a cockroach ? Oh , gee ... My herald , where is he ? I wish to reward him for finding this succulent world . Ah , your herald , like , the Silver Surfer , right ? What have you done with him ? We don 't know where he is . Last thing we know , he fell off the roof in a fight ... A fight ? You dared resist my sentinel of the spaceways ! [ metallic creaking ] [ resounding clunk ] Well , what does it matter ? My moment is at hand . It is time for me to dine . ¶ There 's Galactus looking hungry ¶ And Doctor Doom is near ¶ Here come the Skrulls invading ¶ Do you run and hide in fear ? ¶ No way , no way , no way ¶ Just call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four ¶ That 's all , no more Now , that 's grammatical ¶ Reed Richards is elastic ¶ Sue can fade from sight ¶ Johnny is the Human Torch ¶ The Thing just loves to fight ¶ Call for the Four ¶ Fantastic Four

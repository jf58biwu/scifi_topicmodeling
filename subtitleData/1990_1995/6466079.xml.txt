 Mulder , it 's me . I just had something incredibly strange happen . This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry , it has some kind of a code on it . I ran it through a scanner and some kind of a serial number came up . What the hell is this thing , Mulder ? It 's almost as if ... It 's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him . - Come on ! - Mulder ! I need your help ! Mulder ! They 're taking that down to the lab now . - Mulder ! - Lady ... I need your help ! Mulder ! Mulder ! - You can 't disturb the crime scene . - It 's my daughter 's apartment . Just let me go . I have to get through . I have to get in ! Mrs Scully ? She 's not in there . Where is she ? Where is she ? Holly Reardon reporting live . Police have refused to identify the kidnapping victim . We have received unconﬁrmed ... I knew it would happen this way . I had this dream about Dana being taken away . It 's so strange . I , uh ... I was gonna call her , ... .. but I was afraid I was gonna scare her . She would 've laughed at me , anyway . She doesn 't believe in that kind of thing , you know . According to the reports , Agent Scully states that Duane Barry 's propensity for violence ... .. is due to brain damage from a bullet wound in the head . Is this the operational opinion ? Yes , sir . Is there another ? He 's convinced he 's going to be abducted by aliens . That by taking someone to the abduction site , he won 't be abducted himself . That he 's following orders from alien voices in his head ? Yes . Well , that 's an interesting spin on the Nuremberg defence . Which explanation do you subscribe to , Agent Mulder ? There 's a question of how he could 've gotten to her . And you think these alien voices told him ? Scully was carrying a piece of metal that was removed from Duane Barry 's abdomen . He described it as a tracking device . Agent Scully ... thought that you had made a miscalculation ... .. in Duane Barry 's psychosis . Is that true ? Yes . But that still doesn 't explain how he could have found her . - Where would he be taking her ? - I don 't know . He talked about a mountain . He wasn 't specific about the location . Well , however he got to her , he took Agent Scully 's car and her weapon . We all understand the seriousness of this matter and should proceed ahead quickly . - Turn over your files to HRT . - I 'd like to brief them myself . - Go home . You 've been up all night . - Sir , I know Duane Barry . - I 've been in his head . I know how he thinks . - You 're too close to this case ! If we can use you , we will . - Sir ... - That 's an order , Agent Mulder . Make sure he gets home safely . You 'll see him in your nightmares You 'll see him in your dreams He ' II appear out of nowhere And he ain 't what he seems You 'll see him in your head On the TV screen Hey , buddy , I 'm warning you to turn it off He 's a ghost , he 's a god He 's a man , he 's a guru You 're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan Designed and directed by his red right hand Sir , could you turn off your radio ? I would , Officer , but I gotta keep going . An FBI ABP has been issued for a suspect in the abduction of an FBI agent . Sir , I asked if you mind turning that off . OK . But could you just give me the ticket now so I can go ? I gotta be someplace . Where ? I 'm not sure , but ... they 'll tell me when I get there . Sir , put your hands on the steering wheel where I can see ' em . You don 't understand . They 're waiting for me . I can 't be late . Put your hands up and exit the vehicle . No , I gotta keep moving . Please . For your own sake . Don 't stop Duane Barry . Sir , put your hands up . Right there . Back it up a few frames . OK , now magnify this area . - Oh , my God . - She 's still alive . Print this up . - I just wanna go back to the place . - What place ? Where it started . Where they ﬁrst came and got me . Where is that ? A mountain . We went , uh ... up and ... up . Ascending , ... .. ascending to the stars . Ascending , ... - .. ascending to the stars . - Coffee ? Yeah . Thanks . - How 'd you sleep ? - I didn 't . They 're not taking Duane Barry again . A mountain . We went , uh ... up and ... up . Ascending , ... .. ascending to the stars . - .. ascending to the stars . - What is it ? - Where was that patrolman killed again ? - Rixeyville , Virginia . Route 229 . - Doesn 't it lead to the Blue Ridge Parkway ? - I don 't know . What ? " Ascend to the Stars . Skyland Mountain . " - You know where he 's goin ' ? - Get your car . Meet me downstairs . - Where are we going ? - Get your car . - What about Skinner ? - I 'll deal with Skinner . He thinks Scully 's been taken to Skyland Mountain . I 'll hold him off till they locate her . Wait , here he comes . I 'll be in touch . Come on , let 's go . Hey ! - You 're dozing off . Maybe I should drive . - I 'm fine . - Well , you haven 't slept yet . I have . - I said I 'm fine . You know , Chernobyl , Exxon Valdez , Three Mile Island , ... .. they were all linked to sleep deprivation . The department of transportation estimates that over 190,000 fatal car crashes ... .. every year are caused by sleepiness . Did they estimate how many people are put to sleep listening to their statistics ? I 'm just trying to keep you awake . Look , if Skinner sends in the whole cavalry , Duane Barry might go over the edge . You 're right . If we find him first , we 'll notify the Bureau . All right ? Yeah . You really think he tracked her down with that implant ? Well , that 's the easiest explanation . - It 's also the most implausible . - Is there another possibility ? Somebody could 've given him her address . I don 't know who . There 's our turn-off . - Have you seen this guy ? - Yeah , he was here . He 's wanted for kidnapping a federal agent . Did you let him go up on the tram ? It 's shut down in the summer . I told him to take the back road . - How long ago ? - 45 minutes . - Did he have a woman with him ? - No . - How long does it take to drive ? - Over an hour . - You gotta get me up there . - No . No way . We just got done refitting the cable . It hasn 't been tested with passengers yet . - You have to drive . - I don 't have time . - You don 't have a choice . - No . You don 't have a choice . I can 't stop you from going up there . But if there 's a problem with the cable , I 'm shutting this thing down . I 'm not gonna be responsible for your death . What are you doing ? Stay here . And whatever happens , don 't let him stop the tram . You hit your " run " and " up " button on the panel . " Speed indicator " controls your ascent . Now , when you wanna slow down ... Don 't crank it faster than 15 ! What the hell 's he doing ? I told him not to go that fast . Base to car one . Pick up . D 'you hear that sound ? At this speed the cable can 't hold . This is base . Please pick up the handset . Can you hear me ? Slow it to 15 or I 'll shut this thing down . Base to car one . Pick up . - Base to ... - Go ahead . - Slow it down . - You 're breaking up . Slow it down or the cable will jump the tower . Second tower 's coming up . Slow it through the next tower . - How close is he ? - He should be up top in a minute . There he is . What are you doing ? Turn us back on . Krycek , what 's happening down there ? Krycek , do you read me ? Tell the operator to restart the tram . Hello ? I 've got him stalled up there . I 'll hold until you advise . Is there an emergency system on board ? Can you read me down there ? Can anyone read me ? .. with scattered rain and intermittent thunder showers . Look for highs tomorrow around 65 degrees , with tonight 's low dipping to 48 degrees . That high-pressure ridge has moved east now . There will be unstable activity . Joining me now for the business report is Susan Roberts . The dollar turned on the foreign exchange markets , while closing stronger here . Gold dropped almost two dollars , in spite of the speculation about inflationary trends . Silver was down 80 cents . Yes ! - Federal agent ! - Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! - Freeze ! - Yes ! I said freeze ! Where is she ? I 'm free , you son of a bitches ! You can 't touch Duane Barry any more ! Don 't move ! Don 't move ! - I 'm not going anywhere . - Where is she ? Where 'd you leave her ? - They took her . - Who ? Them ! I told you they were gonna take somebody else . They did ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! A search and rescue chopper has found them on the mountain . We 've sent out ﬁve teams to search for that missing federal agent . Some water ? You can wait outside . Now what happened after you took her out of the trunk ? We walked a little ways up to the top of the mountain . Right where you found me . - Then where 'd you take her ? - I didn 't . They did . That was the deal . Her instead of me . - Did you kill her ? - No . I swear . - How 'd you get this ? - From the ship . - What ship ? - You saw it . - I saw a helicopter . - They were here ! I 'm not lying to ya ! There they are ! Ask them . They know what happened . - Sit down , Duane . - No ! You 've gotta stop ' em ! Hurry ! Hurry ! They were just out there ! They were right outside ! They ... - Duane , settle down ! - No ! They 'll tell you where she is ! The military 's in on it . Just ask ' em ! Did you hurt her ? Did you hurt her ? ! - No ! - What is this ? I 'm sorry . They had to take her . I hope they 're not hurting her ... too much with the tests . I 'm sorry . - Hey . - Yeah ? - What 's the matter ? What did he say to you ? - He 's given me nothing . Were you out here alone ? Yeah . Why ? Nobody goes in or out of that room . Hey , Mulder ... Rescue two ... - What are you doing ? - I heard him ... Come here . Come here . I heard him gagging . He couldn 't breathe . - He said you choked him . - No one is to interrogate the suspect . - Except you ? - Except me . - Did you ask him about Scully ? - Yeah . - What did he say ? - He started whistling " Stainrvay to Heaven " . - Keep an eye on him . - OK . - You 've got Duane Barry ? - Yes , sir . Agent Mulder , you disobeyed my direct order . Call the paramedics ! - What happened ? - He was gagging . Duane . Duane . Duane . Coming through ! - Respiration ? - Nothing . Start CPR . Ready ? One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three ... Excuse me ? I 'm Agent Mulder . I 'd like a copy of this man 's autopsy report . I 'm sorry . It 's still incomplete . - Are you the pathologist ? - Yes . Can I ask what your preliminary findings are ? Um ... second-degree burns on the face , contusions about the neck , bruised larynx . If I had to list cause of death at this point , I 'd have to say asphyxiation . Were you expecting something else ? - You haven 't run a toxicological yet ? - They should be finished shortly . I 'd be interested to see what you find . When will it be on file ? - Later this morning . - I 'd like a copy as soon as possible . Well , I 'm sorry . You 'll have to go through regular military channels . What do you mean , " military " ? - You 're not FBI ? - Quantico 's under military jurisdiction . There wasn 't an FBI pathologist available this morning . Skinner 's expecting my report on the Duane Barry incident . What do I tell him ? The truth . - What do you mean ? - Confirm Mulder 's version of events . You 've earned his trust . You have to preserve it . - For how much longer ? - Until your assignment is completed . If Mulder 's such a threat , why not eliminate him ? - That 's not policy . - It 's not ? After what you had me do ? Kill Mulder and you risk turning one man 's religion into a crusade . - What about Scully ? - We 've taken care of that . How ? - We tell you what you need to know . - I 've a right to know . You have no rights , only orders to be carried out . If you have a problem with that , we 'll make other arrangements . The victim appears to have expired from prolonged hypoxemia , ... .. secondary to asphyxiation . Of several etiologies , the most likely is strangulation ... .. due to the presence of contusions and a bruised larynx . - Do you want to speak , Agent Mulder ? - I didn 't kill him , if that 's what you mean . - But you attacked him ? - I was interrogating him about Agent Scully . - He wasn 't cooperating , so I pushed him . - And you lost control . Momentarily . But then I left the room . He was very much alive . I spoke to him . Agent Krycek spoke to him . Agent Krycek says he entered the room because the suspect was gagging . ls Agent Krycek asserting that I killed him too ? No . He corroborates your story . But the fact is we 've got a dead suspect , Agent Mulder , ... .. and no other plausible cause of death . OPC wants both of you to take a lie-detector test . You 're to report there immediately . There is another plausible cause of death . - Which is ? - Poisoning by injection or ingestion . Poisoning ? You won 't find that on the Navy pathologist 's report . - What are you saying ? - That the autopsy is incomplete . That the military covered up the toxicological findings . - And why would they do that ? - Because they know where Scully is . Why are you so paranoid , Mulder ? Oh , I don 't know ... Maybe it 's because I find it hard to trust anybody . - Alex ? Alex ? Can I borrow your car keys ? - Why ? Where are going ? - There 's somebody I gotta see . - We 're scheduled ... I know . Just give me the keys . Please . Thanks . You wasted a trip , Mr Mulder . There 's nothing the senator can do for you now . - What ? - Not without committing political suicide . Why ? Do they have something on him ? They have something on everyone , Mr Mulder . The question is when they 'll use it . - I need his help . - No one can help you now . Your channels of appeal and recourse are closed . Your predecessor could 've helped me . You know , don 't you ? - You know what 's happened to her . - This reaches beyond any of us , Mr Mulder . - Even my predecessor . - I want an answer ! Why kill Duane Barry if there was nothing to hide ? - You mean the government ? - There are no answers for you , Mr Mulder . They only have one policy : Deny everything . - This is a serious allegation , Agent Mulder . - Only so far as it is true . " Agent Krycek was hired by an outside agency to impede a federal investigation ... .. and may be responsible for the death of a suspect in a capital murder case . " It goes on . " And the possible murder of the tram operator at Skyland Mountain . " There 's a lot of blood on this document . Are you standing behind this going on record ? Yes , sir . Then you damn well better have the facts to back it up . I need to see Agent Krycek , immediately . I can 't protect you , Agent Mulder . Past a point , this will become a larger Bureau matter . All right , what have you got ? I found this in Agent Krycek 's car . He doesn 't smoke . Agent Krycek was the last person with Duane Barry before he died . He was also the last person to see the tram operator before he disappeared . When I got to the top of Skyland Mountain , I saw an unmarked helicopter in the area . I believe Krycek gave away the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Scully ... .. to whoever he 's working with . - And who is that ? - I don 't know . The military ? Some covert organisation within the government ? Why ? Because Agent Scully got too close to whatever they 're trying to deny . Because she had hard and damning evidence - that metallic implant - in her possession . Or because her termination would prevent further involvement with me and my work . Do you think Agent Scully 's dead ? I don 't know . How far do you think they 'd go ? What do you know about Krycek ? I didn 't give him the assignment . I only ... Yes . Thank you . Agent Krycek didn 't show up for work this morning . His home number has been disconnected . That 's it ? He 's gone ? He just disappears into the woodwork ? So it would appear . Who are these people who can murder with impunity and we can 't do anything about it ? - Let it go . - Like he ! - There 's nothing you can do . - What can you do about it ? There 's only one thing that I can do , Agent Mulder . As of right now , I 'm reopening the X-Files . That 's what they fear the most . Agent Mulder ? Thank you for calling me . - Sorry I don 't have better news . - Do you know something ? Is Dana OK ? I don 't know anything more about it . I know you 're doing all you can . I had that dream again last night , about Dana being taken away . I can 't tell you how it scares me . It 's probably scarier when you stop having the dream . Don 't you think ? I found this . It 's something I ... I never considered about her . If she was ... if she was such a sceptic , ... .. why did she wear that ? I gave it to her on her 15th birthday . Don 't you want to keep it ? When you find her , you give it to her . I made this !

 Here . Let me do it . Put your number in , then your card . What 's your number , Roland ? Three fifteen . See how easy it is ? - Engine efficiency ? - 94 percent . We need more ! - How 's the back pressure ? - What do you think ? Climbing . lncrease the blade inclination . - l said , increase the blade inclination ! - inclination is pi over nine ! We 've reached maximum velocity . No ! Let it go. lt will work ! The engine 'll destroy itself ! I won 't do that . It 's not going to destroy itself . Come on ! We 're almost there ! - Something 's wrong with our equations . - What happened ? - Nothing . Surnow pulled the plug . - l 'm protecting the baby ! - And four years of work , Frank . - Work that 's going to add up to zilch . Unless we show some progress , they 're going to pull the plug on us , Ron . - He 's right . You should 've continued the test . - Someone 'll crack Mach 15. I want it to be us . I won 'tjeopardise everything because you two can 't wait to see your name in print ! It 's the print that gets the money , Ron . If you want to go down in flames together , fine . You go ahead . I 'm going to do the math . Good night , Dr Keats . What the hell ? ! Roland ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Roland , I want you to listen to me very carefully . We have to open this door , Roland . Stop typing ! Roland ! Roland ! Open the door ! What are you doing ? ! Open the door ! Roland , are you listening ? ! - How was the wedding ? - The part where the groom passed out - or the dog bit the drummer ? - Did you catch the bouquet ? Maybe. ls that what you couldn 't talk to me about over the phone ? The project they say doesn 't exist does exist . - The Icarus Project ? - The next generation in jet-engine design capable of doubling speeds using half the fuel . At least in theory . And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist - who worked on it here at the university ? - Yes . How close are they ? I 'm not sure , but Surnow 's the second scientist to die in the last six months . OK . But how is this an X-File ? You don 't think this is about UFO technology ? There 's something unexplainable , but not unidentifiable . - Keats ? - There . Dr Keats ? We 're with the fbi . Agent Mulder . This is Agent Scully . We understand you discovered Dr Surnow . What was left of him . How do you suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel ? Someone must have shut him in . - The door is operated from there . - By computer ? I 've already been through this with the police . Another member of your team died recently. lsn 't that correct ? Yes . Arthur Grable . He was killed in an automobile accident in November . I 'm Frank Nollette. I 'm also on the project . - Are you certain it was an accident ? - What are you driving at ? Your work seems to be a perfect target for industrial espionage . Who wrote this ? Ron was working on it when I left . The handwriting here doesn 't seem to match any of the other handwriting . It isn 't mine . What about Roland Fuller ? Roland 's the ... janitor . According to the police report , he was the only other person here . - Roland didn 't do that . - How do you know ? Let 's just say Roland isn 't exactly a rocket scientist . Here . Tracy . With stars . Roland ? There are some people here would like to talk with you . I went off the paper . - Sorry . - That 's all right , Roland . Tracy . Would you like to come help me in the TV room ? OK . Hi , Roland . Mind if we sit down ? Thanks . Do you mind if we ask you a couple of questions ? Do you remember working last night ? Do you remember seeing anything unusual ? Seeing any strangers ? Did ... Did Dr Surnow or Dr Keats or Dr Nollette do anything unusual ? Nope . You must like stars . One hundred and forty-seven . - Sorry ? - Stars . You like numbers too , huh ? Roland , let me help you . One ... two ... three ... four ... five ... six ... - seven ... - Roland , is everything OK ? Roland , are you all right ? Eleven ... - Twelve ... thirteen ... - What happened ? What did you say to upset him so ? ! Sixteen ... Seventeen ... lt 's definitely the work of a fourth individual . The doctors ' cursive standards don 't match what you found on the white board . Will you do me a favour and try this ? - What is it ? - Something Roland was doodling . - You don 't really think Roland ... - He was the only other person in the lab . But we 're talking about a sophisticated fluid dynamics equation . Roland barely has an iq of 70 . You saw his facility with math . Don 't some autistic individuals display unusual abilities ? Yes , but even savants behave only as human calculators . They can perform certain functions but they can 't tell you the value of anything or the meaning . I hate to take sides , but the bottom line is no . The terminal stroke on the six , the roof on the five ... I 'm sorry . He didn 't write it . An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees will freeze , exhibiting great tensile strength , but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact . I 've seen this demonstrated on a fish before . I don 't think they 'll do this on Beakman 's World . Has this been dusted ? - Treat yourself . - Thanks . Hey , Scully ! Look at these files . KMAN must be Keats . This file was turned off at 12.31 last night . But look . Someone else entered a file under the name ARTHUR after 12.31 . And worked on it for nearly five hours . Well , it couldn 't have been Keats . Judging from the rigor of the body , he was dead around 12.30 . So someone came in , killed Keats , and then just did some work on an old Dr Grable file ? I can 't access the ARTHUR file . We 'll need the password . Try ... 15626 . How did you know that that ... ? This is Arthur Grable 's work on the same equations the others were working on . Look at all those entries . Someone has been continuing his work since he died . How did you know what the password was ? Wave goodbye ! Wave goodbye ! Wave goodbye ! Bye-bye ! Wave goodbye ! Roland ? Why did you sleep in your clothes ? Well , let 's get you dressed . You have visitors . I 'm not supposed to talk to them . Who told you that ? Remember that talk we had about being shy ? These are nice people , Roland . Hey , Roland , you 've got more shirts than I do . This one would look stylin ' today . What do you think ? - The green one . - The green one ? Please . Mrs Stodie , can I talk to you a second ? See you later , Roland . This one ? There you go . - Do you like yourjob at the college , Roland ? - Yes . I hear you 're very good at it . Do you remember how you got yourjob ? A man talked to Mrs Stodie . What man ? Dr Grable . Was Dr Grable nice to you ? Yes . When did you last speak to him ? Last week ? The day before ? Dr Grable died . I 'm sorry . People die . They go away . And they 're not supposed to come back . Has Roland ever mentioned the name Arthur ? That was Dr Grable 's first name , but we only called him Dr Grable . I doubt Roland even knew his first name was Arthur . Mrs Stodie , can I get a copy of Roland 's file and past history ? - Our patients ' histories are confidential . - l understand , but I can obtain them . The less time we spend in court , the more time we have to help Roland . Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable . He specifically wanted a mentally challenged person . Are you suggesting Arthur Grable hired Roland in order to use him ? Are you suggesting Arthur Grable is not dead ? If he had intentions of killing Nollette , Keats and Surnow , why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect ? But , by the look of this , he 's hamburger . Maybe he staged it . That would explain why his work is continuing on , six months after his ... death . This obituary says Arthur Grable was born in Seattle . His father was a big banker . His mother was active in a number of charities . Only child . Summa cum laude in physics . Doctoral and postdoctoral in aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd . Brilliant future tragically cut short . Roland 's also from Seattle . He spent most of his life at the Heritage Halfway House . The identity of his parents has been sealed . There 's very little information before the age of three , when he went to the home . Does it say when he was born ? July 15 , 1952 . That 's also Arthur 's birth date . Don 't you wish you could fly ? I can . When I dream . People can do anything in a dream , you know . Once ... One time I had a dream we were married and lived in a house . Do you have dreams , Roland ? You can tell me . Roland ? Who 's Arthur ? I 'm sorry , Roland ! I 'm sorry ! Roland ! Roland ! Go away ! Roland ! What 's the matter ? Go away ! I don 't want to hurt you ! Go away ! Go away . - ls that you ? - Yes . Cool do ! What 's the story here ? A quantum physics professor of mine at Harvey Mudd ... flunked me . He challenged a tenet of one of my theories . A theory I later published in Nature . Anyway ... to get back at him ... One afternoon we decided to take his car apart and put it back together again in his office , and left it running . - An egghead classic . - lt was Arthur Grable 's idea . - ls that Arthur Grable sitting on the chair ? - Yeah . - Was he a practical joker ? - Atop of all his brilliance he had a genius for elaborate schemes . Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 lQ is gaining access to and ... operating his old computer files ? Arthur would still have to be alive . - Could he have faked his own death ? - No . The police report on the auto accident was woefully incomplete . A dry road surface . No mechanical problems . The body was never admitted to a county morgue and there was no funeral . If you are trying to suggest that Arthur Grable killed Surnow and Keats , and is after me next , you 're way off . Art could not have done the murders . How can you be so certain ? This is Arthur Grable . Because of massive damage to his body caused by the accident we could only preserve the head . Wouldn 't your client find it inconvenient to be thawed out in the future , only to discover he had no functional mobility ? By the time science figures a way to revive our clients ... - You 'll also know how to clone new bodies . - Exactly ! This technology is progressing faster than anyone thought possible . Ask anyone here . While for us the passing of each second brings our bodies closer to death , for our clients it brings them closer to life . These fluctuations - do they happen often ? We 've had some problems with Dr Grable 's capsule . Our technicians checked it and found nothing . is it possible the brain is causing it ? No . But we are looking for the explanation . The patient remains preserved as long as there 's liquid nitrogen in the capsule . May we take a look at Arthur Grable 's records ? Thank you . Dr Barrington , as to future medical science , what requirements will exist to be an organ donor ? Same as today - compatible genetic make-up . It 's best if the donor 's related . Mulder . Arthur Grable put down only one donor . Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable have the same birthday . I think they 're twins . Older or younger ? Same age . Just less hairy and with better eyesight . - Gotcha . And the moustache ? - No , lose the whole beard . Next ? Close-cropped hair , with a slightly receding widow 's peak . Lose the glasses . - That 's Roland . - Give or take a few pounds . Tell me about your dreams , Roland . It 's all right. I won 't tell anybody . You know , I had a dream last night . I dreamt I was swimming in this pool . And I could see my father underwater . But when I dove down , the water stung my eyes . And there was another man at the pool , watching me . He upset me . He was asking me questions I didn 't want to answer . I had to leave . I couldn 't find my father . I can 't tell you my dreams . Why not ? Bad . Your dreams are bad , Roland . Not you . You 're a good person . I hit Tracy . Your dreams make you hit Tracy ? You know how to work this toy , Roland ? Here . You see , the way you work that toy , is like what 's happening to you . You 're the spaceship , Roland . And your dreams are the controls . Who ... Who runs the controls ? Have you seen this man recently ? Come on , Arthur . We have to say bye-bye to Roland . Bye . Roland ... Roland ! Roland , stop ! Roland ! - Roland ! - We need to keep Roland under observation . Roland ! - He 's trying to get away . - Roland ! Roland ! Nollette 's gone . We should arrange a security guard to find him . No one 's gonna provide anything once you explain how Roland Fuller is capable of these murders . You 've got a brother , don 't you , Scully ? Yeah. I 've got an older one and a younger one . Have you ever thought about calling one of them , and then suddenly they call you ? is this a way for me to lower my long-distance charges ? I believe in psychic connections . Evidence suggests it 's stronger between family members . Especially twin siblings . OK ... Maybe . But in this case , one sibling has closer ties to a frozen fudgsicle than he does to his own brother . Arthur Grable is not dead . He 's in a state of consciousness no human has returned from . What if that state allows one to develop psychic ability that the conscious mind is too preoccupied to explore or believe in ? He could use that to control his brother to kill the scientists . But why ? He 's been working with them for years . That 's a question only Dr Nollette can answer . OK . Let 's go . I have to call my brother . We 've got to find Nollette . Let 's talk to campus security . - We go this way ? - No , we go left . Well , wherever you are , Arthur , I 'm sure you 'll appreciate this . Arthur and Roland Grable , born at Puget Presbyterian to Mr and Mrs Lewis Grable on July 15th , 1952 . Arthur was four minutes older than Roland . identical twins . Which means that they 're the result of a single egg fertilised by a single sperm . Studies suggest that in some cases the identical twin arises early in the embryonic stage . A mutation in one cell is rejected by other cells as foreign . Roland 's condition is the result of a damaged chromosome rejected by Arthur 's cells ? In a way , that would explain Arthur 's genius and Roland 's mathematical gift . In a way . Agent Scully . This is Larry Barrington at the Avalon Foundation . We 've got a situation here . Last night we had a break-in at the facility . That 's right . It 's Arthur Grable 's storage unit . His thermostat 's been compromised . - Was there any tissue damage ? - We 're trying to assess that now . The temperature 's still rising . Something 's blocking our access to the cooling program . Someone tampered with Arthur Grable 's capsule . They 're attempting to stabilise it . Nollette ? What ... What is this ? If I have seen further than other men , it 's because I have stood on the shoulders of giants . No ... This isn 't yours . It 's amazing . There 's this body , sitting there in front of me , talking . But you 're controlling it , Arthur . You ... took my work ! What good was your work going to do you ? You died before you could finish it , before you could publish it . It was mine ! And a brilliant piece of work , too . When I saw the writing on the board , I knew someone had found the key . Mach 15 was within our reach . Our futures were guaranteed . Ironic , isn 't it ? You did all the work , and I get all the glory . No ! Yes . Yes , Arthur . I was here , working on the intake problem , moments away from a solution , when you attacked me . Fortunately , I was carrying a gun . After the murder of my colleagues , who could blame me ? That 's ... That 's interesting . I 've got it ! That 's it ! I 've got it ! Arthur ! Arthur ! Open the door ! Arthur , how do you stop this ? Tell me how ! - Arthur ! - Hey ! Roland , we need you to help us . Please , we need you to help us to stop the machine . Try to remember how . Roland , you 've got to help him or he 's going to die . Wave goodbye , Arthur ! - Come on , Roland . - l can 't remember ! He 'll be held in psychiatric custody for evaluation . - ls he being charged with a crime ? - The DA hasn 't made that determination yet . We 've recommended he be remanded to your custody as soon as the court allows it . How could this happen ? Roland never exhibited any violent tendencies . It 's my belief that he wasn 't acting under his own volition . What do you mean ? This is the work of Arthur , Roland 's brother . It 's a new theory of jet propulsion , unfinished . In the last two weeks , Roland has completed the calculations . How ? We 're not sure . All we know is that Roland was somehow able to finish his brother 's research . Roland ? Where are you going ? Roland , don 't go . I have to . OK . Bye . Tracy ... Wait . Keep my stars . I love you . Me , too . Visiontext Subtitles by Sally Lewis I made this ! english

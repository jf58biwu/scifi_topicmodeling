 Remember when they let commercial airlines land in this town ? Yeah , I don 't understand where we 're going ... or why we 're bothering anyhow . - You 're doing a good deed . - Wanna give us a better reason . Yeah . A maniac hijacked a municipal bus with 30 passengers on it . That 's a pretty good reason . And I got a real bad hunch where those passengers are and who that maniac is . You wanna share it with us . Phoenix . Simon Phoenix . Send a maniac to catch one . Phoenix ! Don 't move , Phoenix . You 're under arrest . Arrest ? Shit . And you 're trespassing . Where are the passengers ? Oh , yes , the passengers . Well , they 're ... Fuck you . The passengers are gone . See , I told the city , I said , " Look , nobody comes down here . " Postmen figured it out ... policemen figured it out . But the goddamn bus drivers just wouldn 't listen . Last time , Phoenix . Where are the hostages ? To hell with the hostages ! This is between you and me ! Yeah . What , what , what you got soldier boy ? Do something . Go ahead . You 're up to your ass in gasoline . I 'll set your ass on fire . Is it cold in here ? Or is it just me ? Where are they , Phoenix ? Now , where did I put them ? I swear , I 'd lose my head if it wasn 't attached . I 'll keep that in mind . Damn it , John , I 'm tired of this demolition-man shit ! You were not supposed to come down here ! You were not supposed to attempt the arrest of Phoenix alone ... and you were not supposed to blow anything up ! It wasn 't me this time ! He dumped the gas and rigged the place to blow ! Right , you weren 't involved . I know you 've tried to nail this psycho for two years . But remember a thing called ... official police procedure ? - Where are the hostages ? - They 're not here . What do you mean they are not here ? He must 've stashed them someplace else ! So how do you know they weren 't in there . Are you sure ? Because I did a thermo check and there was eight of them , all part of his gang . Wrong again ! You got something to say , scumbag ? Get him out of here ! Motherfucker ! You and I are going to have a nice long chat . Captain ! Over here ! There 're bodies everywhere ! There must be 20 or 30 . They 're everywhere . See that , captain ? I told him ! He said he didn 't care ! Oh my god . How could you sacrifice all those innocent people for me ! What kind of man are you ! We 'll spend a lot of quality time together . See you , sweetie ! Honey ! Sugar ! If you got a lawyer , better call him . John Spartan , you 've done great deeds for the city of Los Angeles . So it is with some regret that I , William Smithers ... acting as Assistant Warden , hereby carry out this sentence . Skip it . Sergeant Spartan , you 've been sentenced to 70 years ... sub-zero re-habilitation in the California Cryo-Penitentiary ... for the involuntary manslaughter of 30 innocent civilians . Skip it . You 'll be placed in cryo-stasis for the duration of your sentence ... during which your behavior will be altered through synaptic suggestion . You 'll be eligible for parole no earlier than the year 2046 . I 'm sorry , Sergeant . All personnel ... the next scheduled parole hearing for prisoner Gilmour ... will take place at 07 : 15 . Warden William Smithers , report to Level A , conference room . Mellow greetings , Warden William Smithers . Be well , Lieutenant Lenina Huxley . As it is a beautiful ... Monday morning and as my duty log ... irrationally requires it . I 'm querying you on the prison population . Does the tedium continue ? Your question is amusing but irrelevant . The prisoners are ice cubes . They never move . I find this lack of stimulus to be truly disappointing . - Don 't you think ? - I try not to . However , you 're young , think all you want . Things don 't happen anymore , we 've taken care of all that . I 'll fiber-op you back after the parole hearings . Have a peachy day , Lieutenant . Be well . Be well . Vector 137 .

No police presence is requested in the city at this time . Report to the station . Oh , boy , how exciting . EF That 's it . Food , glorious food . There 'll be another one in about 12 hours . These assholes are predictable . God , I love to hate this place ! There 's not enough of us , Friendly . That doesn 't really matter anymore . People are hungry . We 've nothing left to lose . Greetings . Lovely Lenina . Greetings , welcome to the emergency line of the SAPD . If you prefer an automated response , press one now . Be well . Mellow greetings , Lenina Huxley . Let me guess , all is serene ? On the contrary , it 's been a horrific a.m. There were defaced public buildings . Walls smudged with ... scandalous graffiti . Really ? Brutal . Why wasn 't an " all cars " notified ? Because there was no need to create widespread panic . Lieutenant Huxley ... I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments ... to the warden this morning . Do you really long for chaos and disharmony ? Your fascination with the 20th century seems to be affecting your better judgment . You realize you 're setting a bad example for other officers and personnel . Thank you for the attitude readjustment . Info assimilated . Sanctimonious asshole . Lenina Huxley , you are fined 1 / 2 credit ... for a ' sotto voce ' violation of the verbal morality statute . Thank you . That was tense . - That was tense ? - Yes . Tell me something , Garcia ... Don 't you get bored code tracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes ? Actually no . I find my job deeply fulfilling . I just can 't get over the reality of this office , Lenina Huxley . You 're still addicted to the 20th century . High from its harshness . Buzzed by its brutality . Holy smokes ! Is there anything in this office which doesn 't violate Contraband Ordinance 22 ? Only you , Alfredo Garcia . Don 't you ever want something to happen ? Goodness , no . I knew you 'd say that . What I wouldn 't give for some action . Mr. Simon Phoenix . One of our first and most illustrious members . Allow me to ... welcome you to your parole hearing . Let 's get this over quickly . Twenty-nine years ago , the parole system , as you know it ... was rendered obsolete . Federal Statute 537-29 ... Stop it ! Do you have anything fresh to say on your behalf ? I thought not . Yeah , I do . Teddy bear . How 'd you know the password ? I wish I knew . Simon says , die .

Someone to kill . Gun noun . Portable firearm . This device was widely utilized in the urban wars of the late 20th century . Referred to as a " pistol " . Look , I don 't need a history lesson . Come on , hell . Where are the goddamn guns ? You are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute . What ? Fuck you . Your repeated violation of the verbal morality statute has caused me to notify the police . Please remain where you are for your reprimand . Yeah , right . Fuckers are fast too .

The problem is not the defacement of public buildings or ... the noise pollution caused by the exploding devices . Allow me to explain . The real problem lies in the man whose initials ... mark the detonating graffiti ... on the streets of our peaceful city . The man behind the " EF " ... Mr. Edgar Friendly . For a sadly extended period of time ... we in San Angeles ... have been plagued by a pack of subterranean hooligans . You will come to know them as " scraps " . Men and women who have left the comfort of our society ... only to spew hostility ... at the very bottom they have relinquished . There was a time when we used to look upon these scraps ... as rather pathetic and relatively harmless . Now they have a leader . Mr. Friendly seems relentless in his ambition ... to infect our harmony with his venom . He must , of course ... be stopped . This radical terrorist behavior , led by Mr. Friendly ... must not be allowed to undermine our safety . Safety Above All . I expect your trust , confidence and certitude . Excuse me . Dr. Cocteau ... a cryo-con has effected self-release from the penitentiary . It 's quite horrific . MurderDeathKills , all categories of chaos . Enhance your calm . Be well them for me . Get me Captain George Earle immediately . It was just ... I mean it was so ... How can a man be so blatantly sadistic ? It was fun for him . I want you to do everything in your power to snare this agent of destruction . You have my utmost confidence . It will be done , Dr. Cocteau . Be well . " Utmost confidence . " " Everything in our power " . What else is there ? Zachary Lamb ... how was the fiendish Simon Phoenix apprehended back in the 20th ? Twelve-state manhunt . Satellite surveillance . A video bite on " Unsolved Mysteries " . None of them worked . In the end , it took just one man . One cop . John Spartan . John Spartan ? That 's right . They called him the " Demolition Man " . Spartan file 98345 , LAPD . Spartan file 98761C , LAPD . Are you sure this is real life ? Barely . Spartan 's a legend . I 've been doing a historical study . Over 1,000 arrests over three years . All authentic criminals . There was a lot more business back then . How can you justify destroying a $ 7 million mini mall ... to rescue a girl whose ransom is only $ 25,000 ? Fuck you , lady . Good answer . This is your recommendation ? ! The Demolition Man 's an animal . He 's clearly the man for a job such as this . You could reinstate him . He 's a muscle-bound grotesque ... who hasn 't worn a shield in 40 years . Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal . We need an old-fashioned cop . Biofax 312-618 is ready for regular routine inspection . John Spartan , 5864 . Pulmonary activity approaching normal . Body temperature , 63 % and rising . Biolink engaged . Laser defibrillation sequence started . Plasma transfer in 15 seconds . Plasma transfer , 10 seconds ... 8 seconds ... 6 seconds ... Plasma transfer complete . MTL complete . Hunting down an escaped cryo-con ... by releasing another one ? I am unconvinced . This is within the powers of the police charter , sir . He can be released on limited parole and reinstated to active duty . It 's not enough to collect the ' 90s , you have to bring the man 's life ? Dr. Cocteau said everything within our power . I can 't think of a better idea . That still doesn 't mean it 's a good one . This man comes from a dissimilar method of law enforcement . I 'm not sure he 's any different than Simon Phoenix himself . Detective ? Detective , I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley . The year is 2032 . Now , the reason you have been released is ... How long have I been under ? 36 years . I had a wife . What happened to my wife ? Her life was extinguished in the Big One of 2010 . She died . In an earthquake . The earthquake . I had a daughter . What happened to her ? John Spartan . I am Chief of Police George Earle . We didn 't thaw you out for a family reunion . Consider it fortunate that the lieutenant even bother did a probe on your wife . This is about you and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix . What ? This morning Simon Phoenix escaped from this cryo-facility . We 've had 11 murderdeathkills so far . You see , we 've become a society of peace-loving ... and , and understanding and we are , quite frankly ... not equipped to deal with this situation . There have been no deaths of unnatural causes in San Angeles for the last 16 years . Where ? The Santa Barbara , Los Angeles , San Diego Metroplex were merged in 2011 . You are in the center what used to be Los Angeles . That 's great . - You , get me a Marlboro . - Yes , of course . Right away . What 's a Marlboro ? It 's a cigarette . Any cigarette . Smoking is not good for you . Anything not good for you is bad . Hence , illegal . Alcohol , caffeine , contact sports , meat ... Are you shitting me ? John Spartan , you are fined one credit for violation of the verbal morality statute . What the hell is that ? - John Spartan , you are fined one credit ... - Bad language ... chocolate , gasoline , uneducational toys and anything spicy . Abortion is also illegal , but then , so is pregnancy if you don 't have a license . Caveman ... let 's finish with all the Rip Van Winkle and get moving . Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes . I tracked that dirtbag for two years ... when I finally bring him down you turn me into an ice cube for my trouble . Thanks , but no thanks . The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the SAPD ... and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix . Or ... you can go back into cryo-stasis . Not many people get a second chance , John Spartan . Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix ? There is nothing , Lenina Huxley . Where 's John Spartan ? He went to the bathroom . I guess he got all thawed out . Sir , I formally convey my presence . How are you doing ? We 're not used to physical-contact greetings . I don 't know ... if you guys know it but ... you 're out of toilet paper . Did you say toilet paper ? They used handfuls of wadded paper ... back in the 20th . I 'm happy that you 're happy , but the place we used to supposed to have a toilet paper ... you 've got a little shelf with three sea shells . He doesn 't know how to use the three seashells . I can see how that 'd be confusing . I don 't believe it . Is that you , Spartan ? Zach ? Zach Lamb ? What happened to you ? I got older . My God , I remember when you were ... a rookie pilot . They finally grounded me . Shit , you were a damn good flyer . You 're fined two credits for violation of the verbal morality statute . I 'll be right back . They seem to be friends ... yet he speaks to him in the most profane manner . If you 'd read my study , you 'd know this is how heterosexual men bonded . I knew that . Thanks a lot you shit-brained , fuck-faced , duck-fucking ... - pain in the ass . - You 're fined five credits ... for repeated violations of the verbal morality statute . So much for the sea shells . See you in a few minutes . Unfortunately Simon Phoenix was not coded . While you 're sleeping , everyone in the city was installed code . It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau . An organic microchip ... is sewn into the skin . Sensors all over the city can zero in on anyone at any time . I can 't even conceive what you police officers did before it was developed . We worked . This fascist crap makes me want to puke . What do you think you 're scratching ? You really think we 'd let you go without control ? Your code was implanted the second you thawed . Why not just shove a leash up my ass ? You dirty meat-eater ! No matter how Viking your era was ... I cannot digest how you ever wore a badge ! You 're going back , John Spartan , oh , yes , you 're going back ! Could you two please dump some hormones ? ! We need every cortex we can get in this situation . We don 't need the Neanderthal . Our computer has already examined every scenario ... resulting from the appearance of Simon Phoenix . It 's determined he 'll try to set up a drug lab and form a crime syndicate . That is correct . I hate to interrupt you two ... but that 's fucking stupid . You think he wants to start a business ? Phoenix is going for a gun . Plain and simple . Trust me . He 's going for a gun . Who cares what this primate thinks ? Resonate some understanding . The only place a person can even view a gun in this city ... is at a museum . Welcome to the San Angeles Museum of History . Beneath you you 'll see an excavation ... of an actual 20th century street scene ... in downtown Los Angeles , preserved since the earthquake of 2010 . For specific information on objects featured in the exhibit ... Firearms are displayed in the Armory ... located on Level A. You are now entering the Hall of Violence ... a visual representation of the primitive behavior prevalent ... during the late 20th century . Home , sweet home . John Spartan , even if Simon Phoenix was able to locate the cache of firearms ... it 'd be impossible for him to remove them . She 's right . They 're located in a maximum security armory exhibit . Just a hunch . Trust me . It 's a cop thing . And what am I , a frog ? Excuse me . I 'll drive . Resetting all bio-links for new driver . Weight , height , peripheral vision set . If you would like ... to commence transportation , John Spartan , initialize sequence now . You drive . Welcome , Lenina Huxley . You seem very much alone , John Spartan , but ... things aren 't all that different . Perhaps you 'd like to hear an oldies station ? Oh , what a relief it is . This is the most popular station in the town . Wall to wall mini-tunes . You called them " commercials " . The classic you 've all been waiting for . The number one request today : " Armour Hot Dogs " . " Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs ... " This is my fave ! " Skinny kids , kids who climb on rocks " " Tall kids , sissy kids , even kids with ... chicken pox love hot dogs " " Armour Hot Dogs " " The dogs kids love to bite . " Someone put me back in the fridge . You are now entering the armory exhibit . Here you will find displays in the cabinets and walls ... So sorry . Didn 't see you there . Sweet baby . Oh , shit . Yes . Now this is what I 'm talking about . How do I get in here ? Is there a 15 day waiting period ? Or can I just take one now ? Motherfucker . Oh , fuck it . Mellow greetings . What seems to be your boggle ? My boggle ? How much do you weigh ? I weigh ... Please vacate the museum , patrons . Be calm . Please vacate ... the museum , patrons . Be calm . Wait a minute , this is the future . Where are all the phaser guns ? Mellow greetings , sir . What 's your boggle ? Warning , please exit rapidly . The magnetic accelerator gun ... the last hand-held weapon of this millennium , displaced the flow of neutrons ... through a nonlinear cycloid electromagnetic accumulator . So , what ? It needs batteries ? What size ? I mean where the fuck do you find batteries ? Is there a battery store around ? Excuse me , museum patron . Can I ... Where 's Radio Shack ? Sweet music to my ears . The magnetic accelerator gun will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes . I was thinking about leaving quickly . Patience is not one of my virtues . Did you see that ? What ? Never mind . I give up trying to figure this place out . Excuse me , Rambo . I need to borrow this . Access and correlate procedure . Establish communication with intruder . Wrong . - Luke Skywalker , use the Force . - Oh , dear . - What the hell is this ? - It 's a glow-rod . It 's what we got . Does it work ? Guess so . He 's trapped in section 8 . I doubt it , Huxley . Make sure the building 's clear . Done . I want a visual . Now , every corridor of the museum , I want full sensors routed to me . You guys wait here . Give me 10 minutes . Museum patron , you are now confined to the armory . Museum patron , you are now confined to the Armory . The armory exhibit is now sealed . All museum patrons still in the facility should remain calm . Help is imminent . This museum is no longer sealed , isn 't it ? What can I say ? I 'm a blast from the past . You should 've stayed there . That voice sounds familiar . Who is that ? Bad aim , blondie . Spartan ? John Spartan ? Oh , shit . They let anybody into this century ! What 're you doing here ? Simon says , bleed ! Great . Just great . You 're making it too easy for me , Phoenix . Come on , you piece of shit ! So let me get this right . They defrosted you just so you could lasso my piddly ass ? I 've dreamed about killing you for 40 years . Keep dreamin ' ! Magnetic accelerator activated . About time . Past is over ! Time for something new and improved ! Oh , hell . Shit ! I love this gun ! How do you like the future ? Come on ! Oh , I know that must hurt ! Huh , soldier boy ? You 're on TV ! Oh , shit ! You 're dead ! Forgot to say , " Simon says " . Oh , shit . Good one . Such a brand new world . Sorry you must go ! Shit ! Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans . Someone will pay dearly for this . Sir , the stress breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak . Shit . Being frozen must have thrown my aim off . Don 't wrong . I 'll get you with the next shot . I don 't think so . No kiss-kiss , no bang-bang . You were doing so well . Now don 't you have a job to do ? Isn 't there a thought repeating in your barbaric brain ? The name Friendly . Mr. Edgar Friendly . Don 't you have someone to kill ? - Yeah , I do . - Excellent . Then go and do your job . Shit . Saved by the bell . Shit ! Damn ! You don 't know how lucky you 're he didn 't whack you . Well , I must say that whacking , whatever it is , sounds most disagreeable . You scared him away . I don 't know how to thank you . You saved my life . No problem . Not bad for a 74-year-old . Simon Phoenix knows he has some competition . He 's finally matched his meat . You really licked his ass . That 's " met his match " ... and " kicked his ass . " " Met his match and kicked his ass " . Captain Earle ... Who is this man ? Detective John Spartan , temporarily reinstated to the San Angeles ... Police Department to pursue the cryo-con Simon Phoenix . You told us to do everything in our power to capture the bad man . Oh , Yes , yes , I did , I did . Yes , I do recall the exploits of Mr. John Spartan . Yes , of course . The Demolition Man . That 's quite all right . Unexpected . Creative . But quite all right . John Spartan , welcome . In honor of your arrival ... and your protection of the sanctity of human life ... namely my own ... I would like to invite you to join me for dinner tonight . The both of you . Please , I insist . I would like you to accompany me ... to Taco Bell . Look forward to it . Thank you . - Taco Bell ? - Yes . So let me get this right : Spacely Sprockets here , who 's now the man in charge , the Mayor-Gov ... who wants to take me to dinner to Taco Bell ... and I wouldn 't mind a burrito ... who is also the guy builts the goddamn cryo-prison ? John Spartan , you are fined one ... Dr. Cocteau is the most important man in San Angeles . He practically created our whole way of life ... - savage . - Yeah . He can have it . Now , Phoenix could be anywhere ... but not being coded can limit him . That is correct . Money is outmoded . All transactions are through codes . So he can 't buy food or a place to stay for the night . It 'd be a waste of time to mug someone . Unless he rips off someone 's hand . But with officers patrolling ... it should be just a matter of tick-tocks before ... We already have a backup plan . We can wait for another code to go red . When Phoenix performs another MurderDeathKill ... we 'll know exactly where to pounce . Great plan . Thank you . I 've been an enthusiast of your escapades for quite some time now . In fact , I perused some visuals from the Schwarzenegger Library . Hold it . The Schwarzenegger Library ? Yes , the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library . Wasn 't he an actor ? - Stop . He was President ? - Yes . Even though he wasn 't born in this country , his popularity caused the 61 Amendment . I don 't want to know . President . What hell is this ? No door ? No welcome mat ? What is this ? How do they expect you to kill somebody ? Oh , shit , I love that smell . Reminds me of biscuits and gravy . All right . A job is a job . Edgar Friendly , whoever the fuck you 're , prepare for Simon Phoenix . So what 's with the Cocteau guy anyway ? He says I saved his life , which I 'm not sure I did . My reward is dinner and dancing at Taco Bell ? I like Mexican food , but ... Your tone is quasi-facetious . But ... you do not realize that Taco Bell is the only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars . - So ? - So . Now all restaurants are Taco Bell . No way . Welcome to Taco Bell . Enjoy your meal . " Valley of the Jolly Green Giant " " Good things from the garden " " Garden in the valley " " Valley of the Jolly Green Giant " Here comes the Neanderthal . Mr. Spartan over there please , and Lieutenant ... Thank you . How are you doing ? Enjoy-joy your meal , sir . Good thing I 'm hungry . Ladies and gentlemen , please raise your glasses to the hero of the hour ... my savior Detective John Spartan . Appreciate it . Greetings and salutations . I 'm Associate Bob . We met before , ever so briefly . I was so , probably in fear at the time . Do you have the salt ? Salt is not good for you , hence it is illegal . So , John Spartan , tell me ... what do you think of San Angeles , 2032 ? I thought the future would be a rotten cesspool . You weren 't here when the real disturbances began . Civilization tried to destroy itself . The city degenerated into a total fear zone . People stayed home , afraid to go out . People wanted the madness over . When I saw the chance to make things right ... I seized it . If I had not , the radiance of San Angeles would not be here . Just your rotting cesspool of hate and suffering . Which would you prefer ? Can you book me a flight out of here when the sermon 's over ? John Spartan ... for your crimes you would surely have died ... in jail before now . Even you must appreciate the persuasively tranquil humanity ... of the cryo-prison system ? I don 't want to spoil your dinner , but my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby . I had feelings and thoughts . A 36-year nightmare about people caught in a burning building . You were awake ? I don 't think so . I think so . My wife beating her fists against a block of ice that used to be her husband . Then you 're nice , wake me up and let me know everything that meant something to my life is gone . It would have been more humane to leave me to the fucking crows . What would you say if I called you a brutish fossil ... symbolic of the decayed era gratefully forgotten ? I don 't know . " Thanks " ? I thought during rehabilitation ... the prisoners were not conscious . A person would go insane . The side effects of the cryo-process ... are unavoidable . You were found guilty of a crime . You owed and still owe a debt to society . There 's nothing I can do . Yes , call for backup . I 'll be across the street . Where 're you going ? Bad guys about to do bad things . It 's just one of those hunches . Go for the truck ! The food 's in the truck ! Grab the big box ! Come on , move , move , move ! You 'll regret this all your life . Both seconds of it . Good night ! Get him ! What a fucking hero . Come on . Please , don 't . What the hell ? Such reckless abandonment . Looks like there is a new shepherd in town . That 's " sheriff " . Who are those guys ? They 're known as scraps . Outcasts and deserters who choose to live beneath us ... in sewers and abandoned tunnels . They 're a constant irritation to our harmony . They 're nothing but thugs and hooligans . A society of thieves . The last remaining criminal element in the city . But plans are in progress to purge this peril from our day . You 're even better live than on laser disk . The way you paused to make a witticism before doing battle ... with that Scrap ... Huxley , this isn 't the Wild West , okay ? The Wild West wasn 't even the Wild West . Hurting people isn 't a good thing . Sometimes it is , but not ... when it 's people looking for something to eat . San Angeles time is now 22 : 15 . Coding off . Auto-drive . Auto-drive engaged . Look I 'm sorry I yelled at you . No need for a de-hurtful retraction . I assimilated too much contraband . I fleshed you out as a blow-up-the-bad-guy-while-grinning type . But I realize , you 're the moody-gunslinger-who-will-only-draw-when-he-must type . Stop . What ? I just do my job and things get ... Demolished . You know I keep looking around , I think of my daughter growing up in a place like this . I 'm afraid she 'll think I 'm some kind of primitive . As much as I want to see her , I almost don 't want to . Because I don 't think I 'll fit in well . Not at all . - It 'd be a minor misuse of police powers , but I could do a search for you . - No . Sorry . Subject change . I got what you wanted . Great . What do you need that for ? It 's just one of those cop hunches . Lights . No . I 've changed that . Illuminate . Deluminate . Isn 't that nicer ? Go ahead , you try . Illuminate . Raymond , Raymond , we 've got to talk . How did you get in ? Wish I knew . I got pass codes . Routes to underground kingdoms . Complete access to the industrial data-grid interface . I don 't even know what that means . But I 've been meaning to ask you . Because I like it ! I like it a lot ! You have these skills for a reason . Not for your personal amusement . Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly and stop a revolution . That is why you were rehabilitated . All right . I 'm going to do your dastardly deed for you . But it 'll be more difficult than you thought . I 'm going to need some help . I 'll need about five or six more " special " men . And I just so happen to have a list . You see , I wouldn 't want you to defrost any of those maddog killer types , you know what I mean ? And none of those motherfuckers from New York . They 're too uptight . So you 're going to be the only maddog killer type ? Fine . Take care of it . Just get it over with . You 're beginning to be more trouble than you 're worth . Oh , Raymond , don 't say that . And what do I get out of all this ? What do you want ? Malibu . Santa Monica . Hell , what about all the coastal cities ? I 'll bear it in mind . - Good , I 'll send you a memo . - Just do your job ! What is John Spartan doing here ? Did you invite him to this little party of ours ? Look , you finish your business ... and I 'll stuff him back in the freezer . Think of him as a guarantee . A guarantee ? You don 't have much of a guarantee . I took care of Spartan once , I 'll take care of him again . Now we need those men defrosted . So this is where you live , Huxley ? Very not bad . Thank you . Where will I be staying ? I 've procured you a domicile down the corridor from my own . Everything is voice coded , so if you need something , just ask . Lights . What do you think ? Clicked off a lot of credits to create a 20th century apartment . It 's very ... Isn 't it ? John Spartan ... There 's a course say , well-known ... and documented connection between sex and violence . Not so much a causal effect ... but a general state of neurological arousal . And ... after having observed your behavior this evening and ... my resultant condition ... I was wondering if you 'd like to have sex ? With you ? Here ? Now ? Great ! I 'll be right back . Love boat ? Here . Now , just relax . We 'll begin in a few seconds . Begin what ? Having sex , of course . What 's wrong ? You broke contact . Contact ? I didn 't even touch you yet . I thought , you wanted to make love . Is that what you call this ? Vir-sex produces high alpha waves during transference of sexual energies . All right . Let 's do it the old-fashioned way . Disgusting ! You mean ... - fluid transfer ? - No , I mean boning , the wild mambo . That is no longer done . The exchange of bodily fluids , do you know what that leads to ? yeah , I do Kids , smoking , desire to raid the fridge . Rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one of the major reasons of the downfall of the society . After AIDS , there was NRS , after NRS , there was UBT . One of the first things Dr. Cocteau was able to do was outlaw ... and behaviorally engineer all fluid transfer out of socially acceptable behavior . Not even , not even a mouth transfer 's condoned . Kissing 's not allowed ? ! Damn , I was a good kisser . What about kids ? Procreation ? We go to a lab . Fluids are purified , screened ... and transferred by authorized medical personnel only . It is the only legal way . What 're you doing ? Breaking the law . You are a savage creature , John Spartan . And I wish you to leave my domicile . Now ! You know ... Code accepted . Be well , John Spartan . Lights . " He doesn 't know how to use the three sea shells . " " Behavioral engineering " ? Hi , Marty , I was thinking ... Oh , my God , I 'm sorry , wrong number . Our noble facility has been desecrated ... Someone will pay dearly for this . Sir , the stress breeder is inside being demobilized . Shit ! Being frozen must 've thrown my aim off . The next shot . I don 't think so . No kiss-kiss , no bang-bang . - Detective . - I 'm sorry about last night . This is for you . For me ? Thank you . I 'll drive . - I must learn to do this once in my life . - OK . Thank you for the gift . Look I don 't know what you guys do in my cryo-sludge but when I thawed , the first thing I wanted to do is knit . I mean , how come I know what a zipperfoot , a shuttle and a bobbin is ? I could weave a throw rug now with my eyes closed . It 's part of your rehab program . For each inmate the computer draws up a skill or trade ... which best suited to their genetic disposition . It implants the knowledge ... and the desire to carry out whatever , the training assigned . I 'm a seamstress ? That 's just great . I come out of cryo-prison and I 'm Betsy-fucking-Ross . Phoenix comes out , can access computers , operate all vehicles ... knows the location of every damn thing in town ... and three times stronger than when he was in . - Can you get me Phoenix 's rehab program now ? - Sure . - I 'm a seamstress . - Access code for Simon Phoenix . Access Simon Phoenix . Accessing . Access denied . - What ? - Security override . It can 't be right . Access granted , Officer Huxley . Accessing Simon Phoenix , Deepfile rehab 65-R . Urban Combatkill . Torture Methodology . Computer Override Authority . - There must be a mistake . - Survival Tactics . Terrorism Tactics . Weapons Training . Martial Arts . MurderDeathKill . Explosives technician . Violent Behavior . - This isn 't a rehab program . - No kidding . This would create a monster . Who develops these programs ? Cocteau Industries of course . But why would the benevolent ... Dr. Cocteau send such a brute savage into our midst ? Good question . Let 's go ask him . No , John Spartan . You do not accuse our savior of being connected with a ... multi-murderdeathkiller like Phoenix . It 's , rude . I 'll be subtle . I 'm good at subtle . Mellow greetings . We are happy to welcome you ... to the Cocteau Behavioral Engineering Complex . Be well . Enhance your calm , John Spartan . Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition , detective ... but I do have a entire city-gov to run . Well , run this . You programmed Phoenix 's rehab to turn him into a terrorist . And I don 't think his escape was an accident . - Very subtle . - Thank you . Outside the museum , why didn 't he blow your brains up ? What did you say ? I don 't remember . Does it matter ? Yeah , it matters . I saw the security disk . He had 10 seconds to figure out where to put the hole in your fucking head . - John Spartan , this display of barbaric behavior was unacceptable even in your time . - Yeah But it works . When a man like Phoenix has a gun near your head , 10 seconds is 9.5 seconds longer than you live . Not everyone is as eager as you ... to resort to violence to solve all the difficulties in life . Even now , I begin wondering if the chaos in the museum was the result of Mr. Phoenix 's presence or your own . Wonder about this , shithead . If you think you got this maniac under control , trust me ... you don 't . - Is there something specific you plan to do with that archaic device ? - John Spartan No , I didn 't think so . Detective , the only thing I haven 't got under control is you . But that can be solved . You , my Cro-Magnon friend , are dead . Your family 's dead , your past is dead . Dead things cannot affect the living . So ... enjoy your moment ... of prehistoric bravado because after you leave here it will be over . Like everything else in your life . Officer , return this man to cryo-stasis immediately . Be well . Be fucked . You are fined one credit ... I 'll wait here . Let 's go . - I don 't know . - I do know . Turn that thing on . I hope you know what you 're doing . You 're asking me to disobey a direct order . I 'm to escort you to the cryo-prison . You do what you gotta do , I know what I gotta do . I gotta get that maniac and put him on ice or that 's where I 'll be . - Enhance your calm , John Spartan . - Look I 've had it with enhancing my calm . I 'm gonna find that psycho Phoenix , enhance his calm . Then I 'll turn all my attention to Cocteau . You don 't have to come with me . I 'll do it alone . OK ? Even if Phoenix was programmed to escape , kill and steal ... why are you going to the wasteland ? Your city-wide manhunt didn 't work because Phoenix was in a place ... you can 't monitor ... afraid to go and see , don 't give a shit about . I wanna go down there , I wanna find Phoenix and I wanna put him in a hurt locker . So , you wanna come with me ? Or you wanna arrest me ? I 'm with you . Let 's go blow this guy . Away . Blow this guy away . Whatever . She has a way with words . What 's wrong , Huxley ? It 's not very clean . A real garden spot . All right . Which way ? Over there . Okay , you guys be ready for anything . My dog 's better than your dog My dog 's better than yours My dog 's better ' cause he gets Kennel-Ration I 'm sorry , when I 'm nervous , I ... Sorry . Over here . What 's that emanation ? Come on guys . No . Hey , just relax . All I want is a burger and a beer if you got one . How will I pay ? Huxley , it 's better to give . Want a slug ? No , thank you . I think I 'll be sick . Oh , God . It 's fantastic . You guys must try one . Just don 't ask where the meat comes from . Huxley , what does that mean ? Do you see any cows around here , detective ? Rat ? This is a rat burger ? Not bad . It 's the best burger I 've had in years . See you later . They don 't seem very hostile , John Spartan . No , they don 't . Now that 's a thing of beauty . Huxley , do you know what this is ? A 1970 Oldsmobile 442 . With a 455-cubic-inch engine . Radial tires and bucket seats . I 'm impressed . I studied . So did I. Hand over the glow-rod . Your friends too . Come on , move . You got balls , coming down here . We 're looking for a MurderDeathKiller . Can you help us or just bully us with your primitive weapons ? Or maybe they 're not so primitive . So you think you 're taking me in ? Guess what ? Not happening . You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass . Yeah . That 's right . You tell Cocteau , it 'll take an army , asshole , to get rid of me . I don 't give a shit . I got nothing to lose . I don 't know who the hell you are , let alone want to take you anywhere . So stay here , be well and Cocteau 's an asshole ! Let 's dump them up top . They 're only here to spy on us . Wait a minute . - You 're the guy outside Taco Bell . - Yeah . What do you want ? I guess you weren 't part of the Cocteau plan . Greed , deception , abuse of power . That 's no plan . - That 's why everybody is down here ? - That 's right . See ... According to Cocteau 's plan ... I 'm an enemy because I like to think . I like to read . I 'm into freedom of speech and freedom of choice . I 'm the kind of guy who likes to sit in a greasy spoon ... and think , " Should I have steak or barbecued ribs with gravy fries ? " I want high cholesterol . I want to eat bacon , butter and cheese . I want to smoke a cigar the size of Cincinnati . I want to run through the streets naked ... reading Playboy magazine because I might need to . I 've seen the future . You know what it is ? It 's a 47-year-old virgin ... drinking a banana-broccoli shake and singing " I 'm a wiener " . Up top , you live Cocteau 's way . What he wants , when he wants , how he wants . Your other choice : come down here . Maybe starve to death . Why don 't you take charge and lead these people out of here ? I 'm no leader . I do what I have to do . Sometimes people come with me . All I wanna do is bury Cocteau up to his neck and let him think happy happy thoughts forever . Then I got bad news . I think he wants to kill you . All right gentlemen , let 's review . The year is 2032 . That 's 2-0-3-2 . As in the 21st century . And I 'm sorry to say that the world has become a pussy-whipped ... Brady Bunch version of itself run by a bunch of robed sissies . All we have to do to run the whole thing ... is to kill a man named Friendly , who put it all together . But there 's an extra added bonus . We get to kill ... the man who put most of us in the freezer . You mean ... we get to kill John Spartan ? Exactly . I want you to loot , pillage , plunder , I want you to steal . I want you do all the wonderful things that we used to do before any of this happened . This world will be ours ! Let 's bring back the good old days ! - Are you with me ? - Yeah . Let 's do it ! It is a curious conclusion which you have deduced , John Spartan . But I can find no fault in your logic . Simon Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send into these savage regions . I 'm impressed , John Spartan . They thawed him out just to kill me ? - I 'm flattered . - Don 't be flattered . Be frightened . This guy 's a certifiable nightmare . - That 's why you 're down here ? - Yeah . I must have done something right in the previous life . Can 't imagine what that could have been . Two for the price of one . Let 's take them . Stay down ! I 'll be goddamned . Like a New York cockroach . Everything 's going wrong . There 's an elevator shaft at the top . Does that mean we 're going up ? Momentito , Senorita Huxley . Come on . How nice ! Must 've been expecting me . Now what ? Buckle up . There he is ! He is in my car ! I 'll be goddamned . What 's happening to cops today ? Don 't you know you are endangering civilians ? Auto-inflate ! Auto-inflate . That was lovely . Huxley , drive ! Okay , I 've read all about this . What do I do now ? Push this pedal ? Okay , I got it . Punch it ! Huxley ! Excuse me ? Push the pedal as hard as you can ! No free rides ! Emergency , doors open . Doors opening . Say hello to my friend . Doors close ! Malfunction . Computer , auto-drive . Auto-drive engaged . Going to cut your hair ! Remember the 40 bus passengers ... you blew up trying to get me ? They were already dead . Cold as Haagen-Dazs ! I went to jail with a 36-year smile . You 're dead . Speak for yourself . Self-drive ! Unable to execute . - Self-drive ! Now ! - Malfunction . Unable to execute . Emergency ! Brake ! Self-drive engaged . Brake ! Brake ! Brake now , you , Mickey Mouse piece of shit ! John Spartan , are you in there ? Who do you think it is , Huxley ? I thought your life force had been prematurely terminated ! I thought I was history too . What the hell happened ? All of a sudden , this car turned into cannoli . It 's the securefoam . It saved your life . Look at you , you 're in shambles . Don 't wrong . I can fix it later . All I need is a needle and thread . I really said that , did I ? Damn . John Spartan , you caveman , you 're under arrest ! Return to the cryo-prison . Immediately ! I heard all that . We 'll talk later , Chief . Right now , I need something . A shotgun , a flare gun . Shit ! Defensive red alert ! Stun batons on . Relax . Look at you , you got bump your noggin ... and think you 're Pancho Villa ? Who ? Never mind . Time to take a stand . Good . While you 're doing it , loan me a gun . Two guns . You 'd use these weapons against men and women who uphold the law ? We use these weapons to shop for groceries , dick . You can 't leave . You 're under arrest . This very concept negates the possibility of your leaving . Skip it , Chief . Lieutenant Huxley ! Chief ... you can take this job and you can shovel it . Take this job ... and shovel it . Close enough . I hadn 't counted on this but I must say , you worked out beautifully . People are terrified of you . What 's new ? People have always been terrified of me . But this time they 're really intimidated . Now ... I 'll have carte blanche to create the perfect society . My society . San Angeles will be a beacon of order ... with the purity of an ant colony . And the beauty of a flawless pearl . Look , you can 't take away people 's right to be assholes . That 's what you remind me of ... an evil Mr. Rogers . Will you please kill him ? He 's pissing me off . Put another log on the fire ! I 'll love running this place ! Well , now ... what shall I do with you ? I am an excellent associate , sir . I 'd be delighted to continue my services with your administration . That 's the man we 'd use ... Excuse me , the police are here . Oh , man ! What the hell are you doing ? ! I 'm impressed . That man has died by my hands . It was him or us . There is that . Where 'd you learn to kick like that ? Jackie Chan movies . Looks like the Cocteau plan went up in smoke . Rest in peace , Raymond Cocteau . John Spartan , civilization as we know it will come to an end . What will we do ? I don 't know . But trust me , this is better for you . What 's that ? This is bad . This is very bad . He 's accessed the cryo-prison and is about to defrost multi-lifers . Most of them don 't like you . Most of these guys don 't like their mothers . They 're bad boys . How many are they ? Eighty . All without rehab . They 'll be re-animated within the hour . We must stop this . I 'm not at all pleased about having caused the fatality of a convict . I now understand that under certain circumstances violence is necessary . Good . I hope you understand this . I hope my butt didn 't look like that . Okay , who do we have left that 's good ? Let 's see ... Foulks , Patrick . Jeffrey Dahmer ? I love that guy . How long before the rest are done ? They 're in the final stages of reanimation . Great . Absolutely great . Gentlemen ! Thank you very much , but your services are no longer required . Send a maniac to catch a maniac . Attention . Attention . Cryo-prisoner defrosting re-animation sequence ... now entering final stage . Count down to reanimation of prisoner batches ... 290 , 310 , 480 ... 570 . 10 minutes . - That 's it . The very last one . - Excellent . Accessed . What the hell is that ? Didn 't expect that , did you ? ! Where 're you going ? I wish you the best of luck . Stupid . How 's it hanging ? I 'm sure you 're familiar with the long arm of the law . Why don 't you struggle a little bit ? Make me work for it ! What do you say ? How about ... a little target practice . What do you say ? Did that hurt your head ? Shit ! Goddamn ! Fuck ! That 's it ! You won 't get out of this one ! I 'll drop you in that vat of defrost ... and fry you like a chicken ... or with my little pinky , drop your monkey ass ... I 'll be damned . Shit ! Goddamn ! What am I doing wrong ? Cryo-prisoner re-animation ... sequence now entering final stage . Is it cold in here , or is it just me ? Good memory . Come here ! Shit ! I hate cops ! Look into my eyes . I 'll see you in hell . Not . This is the best day of my life . Heads up ! Did you apprehend the villain responsible for murdering of Dr. Raymond Cocteau ? I wouldn 't exactly say apprehend . But he 's a history . And the cryo-prison ... That is history too . What 'll we do ? How will we live ? We 'll go out drinking , get shit-faced and paint the town . Graffiti slogans , it 'll be a blast . I 'm gonna tell you what you gonna do . Why don 't you get a little dirty ... you , a lot clean . And somewhere in the middle ... You 'll figure it out . Fucking-A . Well put . Greetings and salutations . I 'm Associate Bob . And may I say ... it would be a pleasure to assist you creating a more humane ... Let 's talk about the hair , okay ? Pick a color . And lose the kimono . You look like a couch . Thanks for rendering me unconscious . Huxley , I did it for your own good . - We 're supposed to be a team . - We are . Oh , my . Are all fluid transfer activities like this ? - Better . - Better ? Oh , my . I think I 'll like the future . Now that you 've demolished everything . But there 's one thing I want to know . How did damn there sea shell you work ?

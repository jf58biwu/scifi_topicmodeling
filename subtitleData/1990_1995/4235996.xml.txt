 Got ' em ! All right , we got ' em ! Damn ! Tonight , reporting a scandalous rendezvous ! Who the devil ... ? ! Hibiki Kanzaki , scooper for SNN Network ! Mind if I get an interview with you two ? You are U.N. Spacy supreme commander Exxegran and ace pilot Silvie Gena , aren 't you ? Goddamn muckraker ! And as for the very lovely ... Uh oh ! And so we 're left to wonder what exactly U.N. Spacy ace pilot Silvie Gena and supreme commander Exxegran were doing in this hotel ! Lt. Silvie Gena is seventeen years old and in the last Sol System Valkyrie competition left the competing male pilots in the dust . In a recent SNN poll asking who they 'd like to marry viewers rated Ms. Gena as number one among celebrities ... Oh , man , I can 't believe Silvie would do this ! Another stupid scandal , huh ? Capt. Nexx ! I feel so sorry for him . This 'll probably break him and the chief up for good . Oh , Saori , you 'd just love that to happen , wouldn 't you ? Hey , it could be my big chance . Don 't you dare even think about that ! Sixty ... Seventy ... We actually pulled a seventy-five share ! Morning ! Oh , Hibiki . Is that the scar from your latest victory ? I 'd say you landed the prize for this month 's hit story . Yeah , well ... We 'll have to wait and see about that . Bullshit . You don 't know anything about being a journalist . I don 't ? ! What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? ! It isn 't just about grabbing the highest ratings . You still haven 't figured that out . - What was that ? ! - Never mind him . Who is he ? Dennis Lone . Cameraman over in hard news . Great on the battlefield , useless in peacetime . I 'd give anything to be a war correspondent ! Hibiki ! Morning , sir ! Can I see you two in my office ? Written apologies and explanations ? You broke a story without checking the facts . Not good . The military filed a claim , huh ? What the hell is there to check ? ! A man and a woman don 't go to a hotel to plot military strategy ! Protecting an individual 's privacy is a reporter 's duty . You 'll do anything for ratings . You can 't go on acting like they 're all that matter ! People live to be entertained ! You told me that yourself ! You 'll live to eat those words . Why do you think we hired you ? Well ... You got lucky with your first scoop . That 's all . The highest rated scoop you 've ever had ! I suppose you may be a star at the moment but if you continue with these tabloid antics your journalistic career will be a short one . What 's the difference as long as the ratings are high ? ! If you want to be a pro newsman then you 'd better change your act ! Quit bullshitting me and just admit the military 's making you whitewash this whole thing ! If you wish to continue working here then you WILL write the apology and explanation to them . The military aren 't better than anyone ! What makes them immune to a scandal ? - I hate getting jerked around ! - My sentiments exactly . I want to talk . You 're a disgrace ! It pisses me off how you just go for scandal ! News is the truth ! And I think your military censorship is a hell of a lot more disgraceful than what I did ! Don 't play dumb ! The military always throws its weight around ! That 's not ... Macross Warning ! All visitors who are closer to the ship than Culture Park are advised to return to the park immediately ! All visitors who are closer to the ship than Culture Park are advised to return to the park immediately ! Should bring batteries with me in case stuff like this happens ! Holy ... It 's even stronger than the last one ! - Is it gonna go wild again ? - Scramble orders ? What 's going on ? Hey ! Where are you going ? ! You 're not the only enemy I have to deal with ! We 'll have to settle this later ! Defold detected in the vicinity of Jupiter . An unidentified fleet at coordinates N-P608 . Establish a front line at Mars orbit . And scramble cruiser fleets 17 and 18 from the # 2 battle group . Recon drone 1 reports they 've assumed an offensive deployment . Begin scan . They appear to be a cruiser-based strike force . Composition : Twenty-two cruisers , two carriers four landing craft , and two support craft . Just thirty ships ? Nothing we can 't handle . Probably just a stray Zentraedi fleet . They 're Zentraedi , all right . Mars orbital coordinates MA-224 . Stand by for Operation Minmay . Data link active with cruiser fleets 17 and 18 at Mars orbit . Strike teams 2 , 3 , and 4 hold at coordinates MA-200 . Ten years since the last battle ... I can go ! Please sir , send me out to cover this ! No , it 's too much for you . Please ! I 'll get you the most sensational footage you can have ! I 'll get you footage that 'll have ' em glued to their TV 's ! That 'll have them weeping with joy in their living rooms ! I remember how moved I was ten years ago . I was just seven ! The footage of the Minmay Attack throwing the enemy into chaos and letting the U.N. Spacy defeat them totally ! God , those images are still burned into my eyes ! I want to move people now like I was moved back then ! Gotcha . Hibiki , you have a Valkyrie license , don 't you ? I do ! I do ! Of course ! Then go ! Yes , sir ! But it 'll be as a Valkyrie pilot , not a reporter . Uh , okay . SNN Valkyrie , stand by to launch . Hi there , I 'm ... You ? ! Yeah , it 's me . Give me a smooth ride , kid . It WOULD be this guy ! Hey , driver , get going ! You 're bombed ! Drinking in the middle of the day ! You think we 're going sight-seeing ? You got me . Sorry about this . We 're going to cover a battle . If you don 't like it , get out ! I know what we 're headed for ... Is that an excuse ? ! All right , just take off ! Never mind this assignment , you 're still drinking on the job ! Get off my back and fly ! Report from the front ! Defense system standing by ! This will destroy their will to fight , then we 'll finish them ! Initiate first strike ! Activate ! Hey , Chief , looks like they won 't need us after all . Yeah ... The Minmay Defense isn 't working ... Come on ! GO ! I know the U.N. Spacy has always been able to beat the Zentraedi . But the Minmay Attack won 't work forever ! We 've grown soft with victory and have forgotten what we 're fighting for ! The song attack won 't work forever , eh ? They possess music as well ... We 're at the limit ! This looks bad . Why do the Zentraedi have singing , too ? They don 't look like they 're your run of the mill Zentraedi . This could be tricky . - What do we do ? ! - Keep your head on ! Take us closer to the battle zone ! Faster ! You idiot ! Quit flying like a scared rabbit ! Gimme a break ! Okay , just like that . Take us to our next target . The next one ? ! This is gonna turn into a capital ship slugging match . We 'll see the flagship Heracles , pride of the fleet , in battle . A fleet battle ? But that 's ... ! Stop whining ! We came to cover a war ! This isn 't a game ! If you 're scared of dying , then get the hell out ! Like I could ? ! I can do this ! STOP IT ! Don 't tape our guys getting destroyed ! You think our viewers want to see a scene like this ? ! They want to watch TV and enjoy seeing our forces winning ! What the hell are you doing ? ! Shut up and fly , kid ! What the hell do you think war is ? ! It 's not some variety show ! War is misery ! We 're not writing some series to get big ratings ! We record the truth , as it is , as it happens ! Open your eyes and take a good look . The U.N. Forces aren 't invulnerable . Space is vast , and it 's utter presumption to think that the universe revolves around the Earth . You think we 've achieved the heights of culture ? Like hell ! What does any of us know about culture ? Don 't be so arrogant ! The Heracles ! I am now truly pissed off . Stay outta my way or else ! All right ! Way to go ! So , Chief , what WERE you and Exxegran doing in that hotel ? This is a hell of a time to be asking me that ! But it 's bothering us ! You wanna concentrate on something ? Concentrate on those bandits ! Yes , ma 'am ! Silvie ! Capt. Nexx ! I have a bit of interest in finding out , too . None of your business . You and the commander weren 't fighting in there . Now come clean . What happened in the hotel ? Never gossip in battle . Certain fools may overhear and slap you with a court martial . " Certain fools ... ? " OH ! I get you ! It 's nothing to laugh about ! It 's just so like you to do this , Silvie . Wake up ! Bandit on your six ! That got the blood pumping ! I could fight 24 hours straight ! Okay , driver , there 's our next shot ! I 'm getting footage of the enemy ship . Take us inside ! You scared ? You kidding ? After this I think I could fly anywhere . That 's the spirit . Showing the enemy 's side and yours , unbiased . THAT 'S journalism ! I think I 've met a damn fine driver today . Great shot ! Are you nuts ? ! We coulda been killed ! Good point . The body may fear death but after a while you don 't feel it anymore . - Let 's get out of here ! - Dennis , look ! A microne ? I think we 've found a scoop . Is she alive ? I think so . She 's beautiful , isn 't she ? Let 's bring her back . What are you doing ? ! Are you serious ? ! Jesus , what 's he thinking ? This is only a two-seater . She 's a girl , I 'm a guy , and it 's a tight fit . What 's the problem ? Dennis ! Hibiki ... Dennis ! Get our footage back to the network ... It 's not our footage . It 's YOUR footage ! No , I couldn 't have gotten it without your flying . That footage is yours as much as mine . Think of the ratings ! You earned them ... DENNIS ! - How about those costumes today ? - A little tight , huh ? So , Dennis ... He didn 't have any living relatives . But the higher-ups here at the network said they 'd give him a proper funeral . Really ... But it looks like this battle carries its own problems with it . The military 's ordered a news blackout until their press conference tomorrow morning . Well , everyone will know the truth when we broadcast . Dennis and I managed to get the real truth out there . Hey , Hibiki . I know you got yourself a scoop out there ! Fill me in ! It 's nothing . Military secret ? Or is it ... ? I hear you brought somebody back with you in that Valkyrie . Hey , if I landed that kind of scoop , you 'd be the first I 'd tell . Well , maybe it 's just them trying to make you the fall guy for Dennis ' accident . Hell , I 'm happy to see you in one piece . Hang in there ! Hello , Shot 5 . Yeah , he 's here . Mash , it 's Hibiki on the phone for you . Here it is . I 've been waiting for this . Hello ? Sorry I took so long getting back to you . So , how 's our sleeping beauty ? In your room , like I said she 'd be . Took care of her wounds and sedated her for her own good . Thanks . You 're a man among men and have my undying gratitude . Hold on here ! This is gonna cost you , dear boy . I read you . I 'll pay into my usual account , okay ? It 's just so rare to find a purebred Meltran ... How rude ! This scoop 'll change everything in this city ! A bill ? Doesn 't he trust me ? Where did this girl come from ? And why is only she a microne ? Hibiki Kanzaki will follow this mystery as deep as it goes . Good morning ? Oh , well ... You understand ! Now you 'll be able to understand me . Sorry if I scared you . Drink this . It 'll calm you down . Whoa ! Your name ! What 's your name ? Ish ... tar ... Hey ! I see ... So there are Zentran and Meltran micrones on this world . Uh-huh , lots of them . Our culture allowed them to join together . That 's me , isn 't it ? Yeah . This allows you to capture time as it passes . To always remember good things ... And bad things as well . And with this , I 'm aiming for the top ! Are there no images of you ? Me ? I hardly matter at all . Now then , could you tell me a little about yourself ? It 's doing it this early ? That light ! Nothing to be scared of . Just an energy flux from the ship . It 's the ship that carried culture to you giants eighty years ago . Uh-oh , it 's time ! The light of the Ship of the Alus ? Someone is coming to this world . I want to see for myself , before I return to space . You want discs ? BM 's best ! Here it comes , Dennis ... It 's time for SNN Wide at eleven . Topping our news is yesterday 's space battle . The battle was the subject of the press conference just held by U.N. Spacy spokesman Alexeive . According to the press release , the enemy remains unknown . But it seems that once again Earth 's culture was effective in fending off the attack ... What 's he talking about ? We got our ass kicked ! Let 's turn now to SNN 's own exclusive footage of the battle . Here is the complete footage of the unstoppable assault performed by Capt. Nexx 's and Lt. Gena 's Valkyrie squadrons . What the hell ... ? ! It 's just the good parts of the battle ! We 're in commercial break ! Looks like we can downlink some additional footage from RCC . - Okay , pull it down . - Yeah , hello ? What ? Okay . Telephone , Mr. Matsui . Who 'd call in the middle of a show ? Hibiki , sir ... That goddamned ... Yeah , hello ? What do you want ? What the hell was that broadcast all about ? ! Producer 's orders . The Media Bureau 's apparently asking we be careful with this story . Are you kidding ? ! That VTR was Dennis 's legacy ! The military grabbed the master . All we had left was the battle footage . Cut the crap ! The network 's just a mouthpiece for them ! You 'll see ! I 'll break this story ! There 's still one card to play ! Where 'd she go ? Millions of our brethren still wander the cosmos . Still forced to battle their useless wars . But when they finally make contact with Earth 's culture they will see how meaningless warfare is . Long live culture ! Hey , baby , if you 're bored why not listen to our gig ? This 'll cure you right ! Why ... ? ! Hey ! Hey , get a grip ! What 's her problem ? The Ship of the Alus ! Where is it ? " To smile is wrong . It gives your enemy an opening to you . " " They will deceive you ... " But why is that ? ! As you can see , the pod which made it down to Earth is the same as the ones the giants use . I thought their fleet was still out at the Mars line . They 've found an opening in our defense line ? But they only sent a recon unit ? There are just too many unknowns in this battle ! What we do know is that the song stratagem isn 't effective . And that leaves us dangerously vulnerable . That 's all . This is a rare sight . You working so hard to be so nice to a girl . Is it love ? Gimme a break ! You know she 's just a photo subject for me ! So why not just sell your footage of her ? It 's a sure-fire scoop , right ? Wrong time . The military 's got the media under its thumb . Once the war 's over , I 'll make it a super scoop ! Liar . You 're just afraid she 'll end up hating you . Me ? ! Are you nuts ? ! Boss ? The shampoo 's done ! I hear you ! Wait a sec ! You can 't fool me , Hibiki . I have an inside line on the hearts of women AND men . Oh , do whatever you want ! You 've such lovely hair ! We don 't get this color here on Earth . But tell me , why did you run away from Hibiki 's place ? He 's actually very pure hearted . And he was worried about you . Did he treat you bad ? - I was looking for the big ship ... - Oh , THAT ship ! The one that sent the love song to the giants . " Song ... ? " Are you in love ? Give it a rest , Mash ! - Better fix that . - Cut it out ! Hibiki ? The treasures of Earth culture . The Roman Coliseum . The Leaning Tower of Pisa . The Great Wall of China . See them all at Culture Plaza , Earth 's greatest theme park ! Here I am ! This is the best place to learn about Earth 's culture . C 'mon , there 's a place where you can see the Macross , too . It 's him , right ? I wonder if he 's up to something ? He 's talking to her like she just landed on this planet . - Excuse me ... - It 's a good waste of a day off . They say that if a liar puts his hand in this stone face it 'll bite it off . Wanna try it , Ishtar ? Just kidding ! See ? I 'm all right . Looks totally harmless . I think we rolled snake eyes . I was hoping he was up to something and I 'd be able to get him back for before . Guess I shouldn 't have gotten so excited . What the hell ? ! Look ! It 's them ! Look out ! What 're you ... ? ! Never mind , just get the hell out of here ! Good timing . I 've got a bone to pick with the military ! Hold it ! Do you realize what 's going on here ? I 'll get this idiot out of here . You contact headquarters . Roger , Chief ! Where are you going ? The exit 's the other way ! There are some ruins up ahead ! We 'll take shelter there ! Persistent little ... ! Target acquired ! Finally ! All right ! That 's 12 kills ! Stop bragging and save the chief ! Silvie ? Look , I 'm grateful you helped us to get away , but why does this always happen when the military handles things ? Somebody I 'm carrying around shouldn 't be complaining ! There 's a lot we don 't know about them . We 're doing our best . Forgive me . This is my fault . - Your fault ? - Ishtar , don 't tell her ! Thank you , Hibiki ... It was so much fun . Ishtar , wait ! What did she mean ? The Ship of the Alus ... The ship sent the love song to the giants ... Feff ! Who is she ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? ! You brought her here , didn 't you ? All I know is that she 's one of them . What do you mean ? I was trying to give her a taste of our culture . And now this happens ! Ishtar ! That idiot ! Sorry I 'm late , Silvie . Wha ... And here is the battle mecha which attacked Culture Park earlier . These mecha are the same as those involved in the Mars battle and is believed to be similar to Zentraedi design and are likely members of a rogue Zentraedi fleet . However , thanks to quick response by U.N. Spacy forces damage to the Culture Park monuments was minimized and the enemy was once again totally defeated . U.N. Spacy assures us that our superior Valkyrie fighters will maintain the safety of the civilian populace until a lasting peace can be achieved . All those wounded in the incident were evacuated by the U.N. Spacy to area hospitals . Only minor injuries were reported . Moving to our next story ... At a time like this ? ! What is it ? It 's the annual U.N. Spacy Moon Festival ! A glorious tribute to the men and women who defend our Earth ! There 's a wonderful song waiting for you ! What is it ? It looks like fun ! It 's just a military propaganda festival . I want to go ! I want to see her sing ! I want to learn more about your Earth 's music ! All right then . I can do a report on it . But before we do that , won 't you tell me who you are ? If I go to the ship , then I will know . If I go there , then I 'll tell you . What is it about that old ship ? Are they insane ? Holding the festival during this crisis ! Nexx , we have to stop this . Silvie , cancelling it would only cause more worry . You know the brass don 't want to cause a full scale panic . I just think it 's strange to avoid panic by hiding the truth . The U.N. Spacy is the symbol of Earth itself . If we appear unsure of ourselves , then the civilians lose confidence . And then how can we defend the Earth ? Maybe you have a point . Silvie ... Let 's just enjoy being together . Excuse me ? Can I get your autographs ? I 'm a big fan of both of you ! My pleasure . Silvie ... Stop trying to take on the world 's problems . Want to take a little drive ? For medicinal purposes , of course . Thanks for the offer , Nexx . But I need to think . I read you . See you moonside . I know how he sees this , but ... It 's dangerous . We don 't know what they might try . Them ! Gotta follow them ! Kinda broken down , but it still works . It 's beautiful ! The closest things to us are Culture Park , and then the city . You can see U.N. Spacy headquarters , too . The inside 's in pretty good shape , considering all the energy spikes . Be careful , Hibiki . It 's so dark . Hibiki ! I 'm okay ! Shoulda brought a flashlight , shouldn 't we ? What the ... ? Are you okay , Ishtar ? ! Yes ... You must have hit a switch on the console . Ishtar , what are you ? I am an Emulator . A priestess who sings to guide the Marduk to victory . Marduk ? ! You mean you aren 't Meltran ? The Marduk are a race of warriors . We 've wandered space since antiquity destroying all other cultures we encounter . To control our Zentraedi warriors while in combat we Emulators exist . You mean you use the Zentran to fight for you ? Correct . Our songs enhance their aggressive instincts and impel them to fight for the Marduk . Music for us is used only for war . Only for war ? But coming here has taught me of its other purposes . And I wanted to learn more . I thought coming here would reveal the " love song " that lady mentioned . Lady ? Oh , you mean Mash . I think this ship is the Ship of the Alus . Ship of the Alus ? A ship known to us in legend . One with the power to lead the Marduk to peace . What , the Macross ? No way ! Yeah , it fell from space a long time ago , but I doubt it 's from your legend . I don 't know . But I sense it is . But if this is the Ship of the Alus ... Silvie ! Of all the idiotic stunts ! I 'm taking her with me ! The military can 't have her ! We 're not fighting the Zentraedi this time ! We face the Marduk ! That girl 's the enemy ! I 'm not letting you keep her just to score some big scoop ! If I turn her over , the news will never get out ! Ishtar 's existence , the Marduk 's existence ... They 'll wind up like Dennis 's disk ! I understand your concerns . But we have our own concerns ! YOUR concerns ? ! You have to let the public know the truth ! Then everyone can have a say about what to do ! Is military censorship going to keep them from attacking ? ! That 's ... Controlling the truth hasn 't ended this war ! Well , then , what do you plan on doing with her ? I was just trying for a scoop at first , but not anymore . I think this is turned into something a lot bigger . I chose to stay here ! Please don 't blame Hibiki ! Ishtar 's known only war . I want to show her that Earth offers something else ! Dammit , it 's my duty ! Or else I don 't deserve to be called a journalist . Silvie ... I won 't let just the military have Ishtar ! All right ... I 'll let you go this time . But next time I 'm taking her in , even if I have to break your arms ! Silvie ! Thank you . Amy , you 're a bit off . Roger ! Compensating ! Program two ! Area C , Camera 3 : Standby ! Here they come ! And that 's U.N. Spacy ace pilot Lt. Silvie Gena commanding Faerie Team for some precision aerobatics ! Lookit that Silvie ! Whatta babe ! You can date HER then ! I 'm leaving ! Hey , wait ! Capt. Nexx ! Isn 't he cool ? ! And passing in review , a proud ship of the U.N. Spacy fleet ! The Lunar Festival is pleased to present Unit 12 's Gloria ! FIRE ! Magnificent . The U.N. Spacy has to be the very symbol of Earth . If they stop believing that , then it 's the end for us all . It seems so enjoyable ... Is this the " love song " ? Thank you , Wendy Ryder ! And now the U.N. Spacy presents its latest fighter : The Metal Siren ! And the pilot is Lt. Silvie Gena ! Thanks , everyone ! Go ! I wish I could sing like Wendy does . You will , Ishtar . Will you sing for me someday ? I wish to sing a love song ... When I return to the Marduk , I want them all to hear it . What the ... ? Huh ? What 's wrong ? Hang on ! What maneuverability ! That 's ... The Marduk ! Ishtar ! Hibiki ... Hibiki , what 's happening ? We just lost our feed ! The enemy 's after Silvie in the Metal Siren . Wendy 's in there , too ! No shit ? Okay , we 've got a Valkyrie up there . Use it ! I 'll get you a scoop for sure ! Show those army boys how it 's done , Hibiki ! We can 't afford any embarassments on this one . I 'm counting on you , Nexx ! Roger ! Isn 't this going a little far ? ! Hurry up and shoot them down ! Can 't . We aren 't carrying any live ammo . What ? ! No way ! This isn 't part of the show . These guys are for real ! What ? ! No way ! Ishtar ! I want you to wait for me with Mash . - No . I 'm coming , too . - Absolutely not . It 's my fault they 're in danger . I must convince the Marduk ... To convince Feff to stop ! The guy who came after you before ? We mustn 't fight ! If I tell the Marduk about Earth , about its music ... Then I might be able to end this war ! End the war ? Take me to the Marduk ! Get my story and end the war ... All right , let 's do it ! They 're taking us prisoner ? What 's going to happen to us ? ! Dunno , but it looks like we get to live for now . That 's ... ! Well , I guess that 's it for us . Sorry I 'm late , Silvie . Nexx ! Can 't let the bad guys have my partner ! All units , move in ! Time for the grand finale ! Roger ! Nexx must have started ! Gotcha ! Hurry ! Save us ! - Silvie ! You okay ? - Hibiki ? ! Yup , and I 'm here to save you for a change ! Don 't be an idiot ! Ishtar ! What are you trying to do , Hibiki ? ! I WILL come back , with the scoop of the century ! See ya ! Do you have a death wish ? ! Chief , are you okay ? ! Nastasha , form up over me ! We 're switching planes ! Chief , what are you going to do ? - Sorry ! - Chief ! So these are the Marduk ... I ask again . What is your mission ? What is this " SNN " ? SNN is a civilian news network . I just work for them . So it 's a propaganda dissemination agency ? No ! That guy ! Were you the one who contaminated Ishtar ? Contaminate ? Did you operate on her to control her thoughts ? Are you nuts ? ! I 'd never do that to her ! Whatever your contamination , Ishtar shall be reborn ! Very soon ! Surface alarm cut off . Looks okay . I 've gotta find that idiot 's homing signal somehow . Is that ... ? ! Good , he isn 't on it . I 'd better get moving ! Hibiki ... Oh , well , better make the best of it ! SNN scoop maker Hibiki Kanzaki here . I have successfully infiltrated a Marduk ship ! And I 'm about to remove the veil of secrecy from ... Silvie ? What are you doing here ? No time for explanations . Come on ! Move it ! Careful , Hibiki . The Zentraedi are close by . That idiot ! Dammit , if they catch you this time it won 't just be boring ! Silvie , something 's wrong . I 've never seen Zentraedi like this . Mind control ! My God ... Silvie , we need to talk . I know . You want to get her . But how do we do it ? Here we go ... Huh ? That 's right . The ship that launched ... That 's it ! Let 's go , Silvie ! Right ... There 's some stuff I want to see here , too . What 's the deal ? This is the emergency storage trunk ! Just shut up . ... that our war with them is wrong ! Ishtar , all they have done is confuse you . It would appear the Alus Nova is needed after all . Come ... Hibiki ... I 'll show you just how tough a Valkyrie can be ! I can 't guarantee your life from here on in . Right . Ishtar , the wavelength is unstable . Calm yourself . You 're disturbing your entire brainwave pattern . Lady Elensh , that world is the world of the Alus . I discovered the Ship of the Alus there . The Ship of the Alus ? Impossible . That 's only a myth . I have touched the soul of the Alus ! The world of the Alus holds a magnificent culture . And it contains so many songs ! Deceptions ! No , they were not ! Songs of joy ... Songs of sorrow ... And above them all , songs of love . Even we , who possess only one type of song ... We can make them , too ! It 's Ishtar ! It 's definitely her ! - Silvie , she 's straight ahead ! - Okay , you 're the navigator . I don 't want to fight you guys right now ! Ishtar , peace for the Marduk means domination of our enemies . Without this , chaos and confusion will reign throughout all space . No , the love song still resonates within my heart . Lady Elensh , forgive me ! I cannot ! Ishtar , return your thoughts to what they were ! You must not defile this most sacred place ! I cannot ! Lady Elensh , I cannot ever go back ! The songs of the world of the Alus resonate within my soul ! Ishtar , no ! This 'll take forever . - Outstanding , Silvie . - Wait a second . This is getting impossible . It 's a miracle we 've gotten this far . We should be grateful to my grandma . Your grandma ? I 'm one-quarter Meltrandi . I inherited my recklessness from her . Silvie ... You 're as reckless as I am . Uh-huh . I guess neither of us can beat the other there . I can 't forgive these guys . You saw those Zentran . Maybe they were only born to fight but they never gave up their right to be free . They 're people , not just weapons ! That 's why I 'm betting on the possibility Ishtar presents . Thanks , Silvie ! You trust her then ? Yeah . And I even trust her sleazy reporter friend . That was just ... Shall we go ? Can you get a shot of me ? Sure ... Report from U.N. Spacy Valkyrie pilot , Lt. Silvie Gena . We have penetrated a Marduk ship . Position weak , outlook poor . Perhaps this record will survive if we don 't ... I guess you can say we 're caught like rats in a trap ! Thanks ... That 's Ishtar ! - Let 's go ! - Okay ! She has told me of you . But peace for the Marduk will come only with the destruction of all other worlds . That is the divine destiny we hold to ! No ! There have been those who felt it was wrong , but that is heresy . No , what we know must be forgotten . The will of Emperor Ingues is all ! Those who have been contaminated must be punished ! That is the Marduk way ! - Hibiki ! - Ishtar ! Careful ! Ishtar ! That son of a ... ! - Hibiki , we have to go ! - What about Ishtar ? ! There 's nothing we can do ! Shit , if only he didn 't have her in there ! This must be that " Ingues " guy 's punishment ! Hang on ! Made it ! It 's the chief ! Chief , do you read me ? ! Chief ! Chief , do you read ? Nastasha ? I read you ! Chief , I suggest you thank dear Cmdr. Exxegran in a big way ! It 's hard getting the keys to this thing ! Don 't ask me how , but we 're saved . Yeah ... Now , will you tell me what happened out there ? Yes , sir . That I went in to save that civilian newsman is the truth . But there was a girl in that Valkyrie as well . Her name is Ishtar . She is an Emulator for the Marduk . And you ... ? I knew what she was . Go on . The newsman brought her back with him during our First Contact . What 's his name ? Hibiki . Hibiki Kanzaki . Him ... Ishtar apparently felt she could end this war . End the war ? Yes , sir . They use their Emulators ' song to control the minds of the enemy Zentran . She felt that , if she could just sing them an Earth song ... But the song has to be sung by one of their Emulators . She was able to confuse them but not enough to change the course of the war . But we have a chance , Silvie . You 've done a good job . Thank you , lieutenant . - Launch Thunder One ! - Inoperative ! We interrupt this program for a special report . The U.N. Spacy has been deceiving all of you ! The Zentraedi who have invaded Earth 's space are under the mind control of a race called the Marduk . This is footage taken inside a Marduk warship . These Zentran have been conditioned to fight better when they hear a special song sung by their " Emulators " . What the hell 's going on ? ! Kill that broadcast ! What the hell is the Media Bureau doing ? ! Sir , it 's being sent by the military emergency broadcast system ! Impossible ! Kill it now ! And arrest that journalist ! We 've traced the transmission ... It 's the subcom Room , right here ! What ? We have the right to know about the danger the Earth faces . The fate of the world , the lives of each and every one of us cannot be left to military control ! Every ... Grab him ! That hurts ! Enemy Zentraedi engaging us at defense line two . Where did you get the footage ? On the enemy ship . It 's for real . You will not deceive the civilians with that fake footage of yours ! I believe he escaped that enemy ship with one of your people , Cmdr. Exxegran . Yes , they went in to rescue this civilian . A foolish risk ! Who was it ? Have them brought here ! I accept responsibility for the actions of my command . Was the person who filed the report Lt. Silvie Gena ? ! If that 's the case , we can 't leave you in charge of this matter . There 's already enough scandal linked with you two . I suggest you leave Lt. Gena 's disposition up to us , Exxegran ! So where is she ? On standby alert with the rest of Faerie Team . Lt. Gena will be imprisoned for three days , as will this civilian . Macross Cannons moving into position . - Four of them ? - Aye , but two more are on the way . Unnecessary . Four will be enough . Situation critical at defense line two . We read losses at 85 % . Number of enemy ships estimated at 1300 . But the actual number is unknown . It could be triple that . They 've come ... We 'll draw them all in , then destroy them in one blow ! Distance to enemy fleet : 126,000 . 26,000 to maximum impact range of the Macross Cannons . Large numbers of enemy fighters approaching at high speed . Launch Valkyrie teams . They must keep them away from the cannons ! Firewolf and White Ox teams , all units launch ! Operation code : D-38 Valkyrie teams engaging enemy battle mecha ! Burt ! Gimme some back-up ! Come on , now ! Battlezone moving back to D Field . White Ox team : All units offline . Enemy fleet still 2000 from maximum impact range . Firewolf defenses have fallen . Large numbers of enemy units approaching the Macross Cannons . Defend the Cannon at all costs ! Bring air defense systems online ! Enemy fleet now in Macross Cannon range . Valkyrie teams , fall back to B Field ! Macross Cannons ... FIRE ! Reading 60 % of enemy fleet destroyed . Excellent . Prepare to fire a second round ! Detecting multiple defold reactions at 12 o 'clock ! What ? ! Second enemy wave has appeared ! Balzae 's fleet is engaging them ! Roger ! Metal Siren , launch ! It doesn 't matter . Launch ! I don 't want to sing the song of war ! Hibiki , tell me ... What should I do ? Where did you get the footage ? I told you , one of the enemy helped me out . Oh , one of them just " helped you out . " Cut the crap , kid ! Who told you to do this ? ! I didn 't do this under anyone 's orders ! I just wanted everyone to know the truth ! If we don 't do something ... Earth will be destroyed ! You 're saying our forces are going to lose ? At the rate we 're going , we 'll definitely lose . I 've seen them ... They haven 't begun to fight ! God damned Marduk ... You 'll pay for this ! This is gonna take forever ! No matter how many come , you 're not getting to Earth ... To Silvie ! - No , not that song ! - Ishtar , why are you here ? Ingues fears that world . He will destroy the Marduk entirely to annihilate it . Ridiculous . This battle is nearly over . At the end of this battle lies another , and another ! And even more of our people will die ! What are you saying ? It is by war the Marduk build their history ! War isn 't everything ! The world of the Alus is teaching us that ! That is what Ingues fears ! Lord Feff ... I am the law here ! Launch all Zentran and link them with the other ships ' song . I will hold Ishtar here ! These orders are all that need concern you . Even if I have to use this ship as a shield they 're not getting to Earth ! Take us in towards them ! Main engines , ahead full ! Capt. Nexx , the Gloria 's headed into the enemy fleet ! What ? ! The Gloria ? ! Capt. Balzae ! Captain , this is pointless ! Pull back ! I can 't run ! I gamble this ship for the fate of Earth itself ! But sir ... They 're still ... Captain ! CAPTAIN BALZAE ! I am a warrior of the Marduk , loyal to Lord Emperor Ingues . My death will come only on the field of battle . Feff ... Go now , Ishtar , before I come to my senses . I will say I killed you for your crime of rebellion . I dared to love what I could never have . Out ! You 're excused . Cmdr. Exxegran , what 's ... ? This is an unofficial meeting . There will be no records . Just like at the hotel . Exactly , only without any indiscrete reporters , I hope ! Commander , at this rate our forces can 't win . I 'm afraid you 're right . It 's just a matter of time before they breach our final defense line . Do the civilians know ? ! No . We may have the courage to die in battle but not admit when we 're losing . The enemy truly lies within . But then ... In a regular battle , our forces may be destroyed but you mentioned there might still be a path to peace . Yes , sir . The Marduk are led by an absolute dictator , Ingues . He keeps his people fighting by means of rule by terror . If we can topple him from power , we can join with those Marduk who desire peace and somehow end this war . Launch a surgical strike on their mothership ? ! Exactly . A sneak attack ! What ? ! Commander , I have a proposal . Use the Ship of the Alus ! Hibiki ... I 'll try to sing . The song of the Alus ... The enemy will soon be here . It 's not the military 's fault or the media 's fault . It 's just the truth ... So many people will die . On their side and ours ... Who 'll die not knowing what 's happening . Everything will end . And no lessons will be learned . Humanity once again makes the same mistakes of history . But after it ends , it 's too late ! I see the truth at last ... I think about them all , and then I ... ! Defense line 1 , Area A : Enemy contacted and engaging . Fleet 2 at Area 2 reports 70 % losses , including the flagship . Confirming defold reaction in Area A. All transmissions have ceased from battle group twenty . Enemy units in Area C moving from point P to point Q. There 's no stopping them now . This unannounced relocation of our defense line to a closer point has been decided to be in our best interests . The effect of this will be a slight risk to the surface . As a precautionary measure , we have begun evacuating citizens of this city into the underground shelters . This is to guarantee your safety . Good work , men . I 'll take him from here . But we weren 't ... Lieutenant ! Silvie ! What are you doing , Silvie ? Getting some payback . What do you want to do ? The U.N. Spacy doesn 't have the strength to beat these guys . We have just one gamble left . We 're going to the Macross . Use those energy spikes , you mean ? The main gun should still work . But there 's too many of them . We 'll just shoot their mother ship . And then we 'll see if it really is their " Ship of the Alus " . Sounds like fun . Count me in ! Too many ! Saori ! Thank you ! No time to celebrate . You 've got 5 , 6 , 7 bandits on your six ! - Huh ? Where ? - You 're surrounded ! - Where ? ! - I 've got ' em , Amy ! Calm down ! We 'll hold out even if the chief isn 't here ! That 's as far as you go ! Capt. Nexx ! Proceed to Cannon Base Two ! But if I move from here we 'll leave them an opening ! Captain , this is a gamble for the fate of the Earth ! Understood . Auto-Lock System , standing by . Over there . Looking good ... The Macross is coming back to life ! Can we really run this thing ? I read the manual . Maybe I should get out and push ? Attack ! Subsystem # 4 : Operational . Reactor output at 85 % . Safeties off , linking to main system . Way to go , Silvie ! Hibiki , open a com channel . Wavelength four . I 'm getting data from UNS headquarters . Are they in on this ? No . Only Cmdr. Exxegran and I know about this plan . We need intelligence on the mothership 's position to shoot it . We can 't fail . We 're betting everything on this one shot ! Blue Liqueur team proceed to ZS-5 and counterattack ! Sir , incoming message from Lt. Gena . - Put it through . - Number four . Lieutenant , is the Macross operational ? Sir , give me the data on the mothership 's position . They have a number of ships in the atmosphere already . Destroying the mothership may change the situation . We 're counting on you , Silvie . Roger ! People used to live here ! Their love song remains even now . Macross , lifting off ! The Macross ? ! What the hell ? ! Receiving video . On left main screen . Who 's flying it ? ! I was never told of this ! - What is it ? What 's happening ? - The Macross ! Look ! Datalink established . Enemy mothership coordinates confirmed . Attack coordinates : GT-200 . RC-98 . Speed : 70 . - Look alive , Hibiki . - Gotcha ... Energy level rising from eighty to ninety . Distance to attack coordinates : 10,000 . Energy level to full power ! Macross standing by to fire main cannon ! Please ... Let this end it ! Got it ! That is not the Ship of the Alus ! Coordinates calculated . What would be the point ? All on this world will be destroyed ! We 've lost ... Silvie ... If they 'd just listened to us sooner , this all wouldn 't be ... It 's no one 's fault . We all just got a little too used to having peace . We closed ourselves into our little Earth and never bothered to look at the world outside . And mankind IS little . We 're conceited . And lazy ... People in general are pretty disgraceful . And when people finally come together , it 's usually too late . Come together ? Yeah . Like us . But we managed to come together ... And it 's still not too late ! Silvie ... Hibiki ! Ishtar ! This is the power of the Alus ! This is love , isn 't it ? We 've broken their main force . Why , Ishtar ? Why does this world fascinate you so ? What deceives you so that you sense the Ship of the Alus ? ! The enemy mothership has penetrated the atmosphere . We 've no more time to waste ! This is the final plan , our gamble on humanity 's future . Correct . Take us into the battlezone ! Roger ! Everything 's being destroyed ! It 's all over ... No ! This is the Ship of the Alus . We 're here only because it led us here . But we have nothing left to try . The main gun 's useless . The power of the Alus isn 't that . It 's the power that brought you and Hibiki together . And it 's brought us together . That is the power of the Alus . I 'll send it to them . So that the Marduk and your wonderful Earth can come together as we did . Hibiki , I 'm going to try ! Okay . What 's the point ? Open all com channels . Let 's give it a try , Silvie ! We 're here because we believed in the Macross 's power . Let 's try another bet on our Ship of the Alus . We must not fight ! We must not destroy this world ! I am Ishtar , Emulator of the Marduk . There is culture here that is worth defending . In saving it we will create something more . Destroy it , and we will never be able to recreate it . This world has taught me the sorrow of destruction . The Marduk way teaches destruction to all things . And it teaches there is no room for any other teaching . We can draw no inspiration from our destruction . We create nothing ! Ishtar ! We must not fight ! We can come together ! Sing , Emulators ! And let all be destroyed ! It is the deception of an inferior race ! Do not be fooled ! The Marduk are fated to control the cosmos ! Sing , Emulators ! Do not be deceived ! Not that song !

Sing , Emulators ! Sing the Song of Death ! Sing for all the Marduk ! No , Lord Ingues ! This world lies in ruin . Surely you desire nothing more ! You will not sing ? Pathetic fools ! The Marduk way must be preserved at any cost ! I must now once again teach you all this ! What 's happening ? ! The end of everything ... Is this punishment for the sake of the Marduk ? ! We can 't let him do this ! I still believe ... This is the Ship of the Alus ! What 's this ? What ? Sing , Emulators ! Or be punished with death ! Stop it , Lord Ingues ! You 'll destroy the Marduk as well ! Don 't say never again . That melody prayer you say again ... Is this ... " singing " ? I 've never heard anything like it . It feels so good ... No matter how far apart we are , I 'll be sending it to you . She 's sending everyone the gentleness of her own heart . You would destroy us as well ! No ! The Marduk are not yours alone ! They 're killing their own kind ? ! Captain , the mothership is locked on past the terminator ! Open all cannons ! Destroy the mothership ! FIRE ! Inferior scum !

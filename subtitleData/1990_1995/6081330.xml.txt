 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned , he possessed the strength of steel . The speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ symphonic music ] [ whizzing ] - What was that ? - I don 't know . Whatever it was , it hit hard . [ music continues ] Hm . Oh , Jonathan , he 's so beautiful . Oh , it 's what we 've been praying for . [ laughing ] Aren 't we lucky , huh ? Well , we best getting moving , Martha . We probably aren 't the only ones who saw this . [ orchestral music ] [ intense music ] [ no audio ] Lana , I heard Mr. Jackson 's looking for me . - Do you know where he is ? - Yeah , he 's upstairs . Ah , Clark , I 've never seen him this angry before . [ dramatic music ] Mr. Jackson , I 'm sorry , I 'm so late . ( all ) Surprise . - Happy birthday , Clark . - You knew about this ? Knew about it ? Who do you think convinced him of the cake ? Not an easy task . This is not my kinda thing .. ... but the expression on your face was worth it . [ people laughing ] [ phone ringing ] I 'll get it . So , Clark , find any grey hairs yet ? I don 't know . They 're falling out too fast . Alright , yak it up . Yak it up . Wait till you 're my age . Nothing to look forward to except retirement . Nothing to look back on except a lifetime of paper work . Take my advice , kiddo , enjoy yourself now . It doesn 't get any better than this . - Mr. Jackson , you have a call . - Hm , I 'll take it downstairs . [ dramatic music ] - Clark , you okay ? - I 'm fine . [ music continues ] I think .. You 're sure ? Clark . What 's wrong ? Nothing . [ music continues ] [ bell ringing ] Are you okay ? You ran off so fast- - I-I forgot to pay my rent and the bank 's gonna close . But it 's only 12 : 30 . [ music continues ] [ symphonic music ] [ crowd screaming ] I 'm glad to see you 're not gonna make this difficult . Get down ! I can 't control it . [ buzzing ] [ buzzing continues ] [ siren wailing ] Hu-hu-hu . No ! [ tires screeching ] I 'm sorry . I don 't know how it happened . You 're sorry ? You blasted a hole through my shoulder . And you 're sorry ? Good work , Superboy . We 'll take care of him . He nearly killed me . We 're lucky to be alive . I 'll sue . They 're getting to you too , huh ? I understand . There 's times I 'd like to burn little holes in these creeps too . [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] ( man on radio ) The suspects claimed Superboy had used undue force in their capture . Witnesses add the alleged thieves had already surrendered when Superboy attacked them . [ laughing ] ( Matt ) Did you hear that ? Superboy is finally getting tough with the bad guys . Yeah , it 's about time . - Listen , can I talk to you ? - Sure , what 's up ? That call I got earlier was the boys in D.C. - Something 's come up . - Nothing serious , I hope ? No , it 's just .. Well , when I first started out I was stationed at the Kansas City Bureau . One of my first cases was to investigate the reports of a meteor that hit in a nearby farming community . So , I dutifully went out to look into it . The thing is , when I got there whatever it was , was gone . Maybe , there never was anything . No , there was evidence of physical contact . But whatever made it was gone . All that was left was this purple crystal . So , why is D.C. calling now ? That crystal has been in storage for the past 20 odd years . Just yesterday it started acting out . Meaning ? Meaning , it 's humming and it 's glowing . And they 've decided to reopen the case . - And they want me back on it . - Great . I haven 't been in the field for years . Oh , there 's nothing to it . It 'll come back to you . Oh , I suppose . [ dramatic music ] You know , I sure could use a partner on this . I 'd be delighted . Not that I need the help , but I could use the manpower . Of course , of course . So , where 're we heading ? Some little hick town outside of Kansas City called Smallville . ( Martha ) We have a lot to be proud of , Jonathan . That we do . I keep on telling you , Martha , keeping this scrapbook could be very risky . Oh , I can 't help it . Other mothers keep scrapbooks of their children . I 'd feel cheated if I couldn 't enjoy his fame . But you 've gotta admit that the situation is a bit different . You worry too much . Who 'd look for him here ? Especially , now that he lives in the city . Ah , do you remember this , Jonathan ? Ah , ah , ah , look at this . Look at this . Isn 't that .. That 's the first summer . Ah , it 's hard to believe he came to us so many years ago today . Imagine what our lives would 've been like without him ? Well , certainly a lot less interesting . We have to call him to wish him . [ buzzing ] What 's that ? [ dramatic music ] There 's nothing out there . [ traffic rumbling ] [ dramatic music ] Not again . [ water dripping ] [ water dripping amplified ] [ music continues ] [ grunting ] [ knock on door ] Clark . Clark , I know you 're in there , I can hear you . Lana , not now , please . You didn 't come back to work . We were worried about you . I was worried about you . Lana , I 'm begging you , get away from me ! Is this about your birthday ? Because I 'd understand . I know how I hate my birthdays . [ knock on door ] Clark , let me in . Come on . Well .. [ orchestral music ] [ orchestral music ] Martha , I don 't like this . We better call Clark . Come on . [ dramatic music ] ( male # 1 ) Holy Hanna . ( Lana ) He 's gone . So is his deposit . Look at this place . [ phone ringing ] Oh , sure , he doesn 't touch his phone . ( Clark on recorder ) Hi , it 's Clark . I 'm not here , so please leave a message . ( man on phone ) Clark , it 's pa . Something 's come up . It 's got me worried . Give me a call . That makes three of us . [ sprinkler sputtering ] [ dog barking ] [ children distant chatter ] [ dramatic music ] Clark , are you gonna tell me what 's been happening ? - Nothing really . I 'm fine . - Fine ? What about your apartment last night ? - What about my apartment ? - You trashed it . - It seemed like you trashed it . - I wasn 't feeling quite myself . I was hoping it was just a 24 hour bug . Fine . Fine , Clark . You don 't have to tell me , it 's okay . Thanks for understanding . Bye . [ slow music ] [ phone ringing ] Okay , put it through . Hi , pa , what 's wrong ? [ dramatic music ] No , I didn 't make it home last night . What ? When ? Well , don 't worry . I 'll finish up my work and get over there as quickly as I can . I 'll see you soon . [ fast music ] ( Lana ) Clark , you up there ? Clark ! Lana , could you tell Mr. Jackson I had a family emergency and I have to go home ? Wait a minute . Does this have anything to do with Superboy ? No , of course not . That 's ridiculous . I 've gotta go . Why won 't you talk to me ? Hey , Matt , did you see Clark come by here ? No , I didn 't . Say , Lana lives there . Why don 't you ask her ? Okay . How long does it take to get to Smallville from the airport ? About 45 minutes . Are-are you going to Smallville ? Dennis is hot on a trail of a 20 year old case . I-I could go . Nobody knows Smallville like I do . - Or Clark . - Of course . No way , I can 't afford another ticket , let alone a hotel room . Mr. Jackson , I 'll pay my own way , and I 'll stay with my mom . Why are you so anxious to go with us ? I wanna speak to someone who 'll be there at the same time . Okay . [ door opening ] I got it . Now , watch your step . It was lit up like a Christmas tree before but it looks quiet now . [ Clark grunting ] What 's the matter ? Clark , what 's the matter ? I 'll be okay . It 'll pass . - Well , what is it ? - I don 't know . How long has this been going on ? Since yesterday . I 'll be okay . Are you sure ? [ orchestral music ] - Clark . - I 'm okay , pa , don 't worry . Okay , son . - Why don 't you wait outside ? - Okay . [ symphonic music ] Who Are you ? Do not be frightened , young one . I have been programmed by your ancestors to welcome you into the next cycle of your development . My ancestors ? You mean , my parents ? The pain you feel is normal for people of our world . These sensations are only amplified by the same forces that has given you great strength on this planet . Do you know where I 'm from ? I 'm from another world ? I will guide you through the process that will rejuvenate you and leave you in the next phase of your life . Place the purple crystal into the receptacle for the process to begin . I don 't see a purple crystal . I don 't see a purple crystal . Deposit the purple crystal into the receptacle now . Or emergency measures will be taken . Deposit the purple crystal into the receptacle now . - Or .. - There 's red , yellow , blue . Ah , there 's no purple crystal . Deposit the purple crystal into the receptacle now . Or emergency measures will be taken . There never has been a purple crystal . [ rumbling ] [ door opening ] - Son , you 're alright ? - I think so . - In fact , I feel great . - Oh , good . - You had us worried . - Let 's go up and have some pie . Oh , that sounds good . Ow ! ( pa ) How 'd you do that ? [ dramatic music ] My powers , they 're gone . [ dramatic music ] [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

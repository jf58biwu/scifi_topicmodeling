 Yes . - Love you . - And I love you . - Hello . - Morning , sir . Good morning . - Good morning , Cecil . - Top o ' the morning to yeh . Oh , thank you . - Goodbye , darling ! - Goodbye , Charles ! - What time can I expect you ? - Before supper . Oh ! I forgot what it was like to spend a day in court . That 's one of the luxuries to hunting down aliens and genetic mutants . You rarely get to press charges . - lt 's open . - What ? - lt 's unlocked . - That 's weird . - l 'm sure I locked it . - Must be an X-File . What 's that ? I told you I locked the door . What do you think it is ? Ten to one , you can 't dance to it . Greetings , Agent Mulder . Six months ago , British MP Reggie Ellicott received a cassette like the one you 're listening to now . Unfortunately , when he popped the tape into the stereo he armed a device which , when he tried to exit the car , created an explosion heard five miles away . The Scotland Yard forensic team could only identify the poor bastard by dental records . If only he hadn 't reached for the handle and triggered the detonator ! But how was he to know he was sitting on enough plastic explosive to lift the car 40 feet and deposit the engine block on top of a three-storey building ? Aren 't we looking rather ghostly ? It 's an old friend . - Aren 't you going to thank me ? - For what ? Saving your life . One tends not to make the same mistake twice . - l 'll try to remember that . - You left your sense of humour - in Oxford ten years ago ? - lt 's one of the few things you didn 't drive a stake through . You know , some mistakes are worth making twice . Dana Scully , this is Phoebe Green , terror of Scotland Yard . - Hello . - Hello . She hates me . What brings you to the colonies ? Some clever bloke has been giving the aristocracy a good scare . Killed off a ranking MP or three for good measure . Set Windsor Castle ablaze in 1992 . - Your car bomber ? - This one likes to burn his victims alive . Can 't figure out how he does it either . Not a crumb of evidence at the crime scene . The last one died in his front garden , his poor wife watching helplessly as he went up in smoke . The Irish Republican Army ? Our suspect likes to send love letters to his victims ' wives . Sent one to the wife of Sir Malcolm Marsden a month ago . Three days later he narrowly escaped a fire in his garage , burned down . So they 're renting a place out on Cape Cod , bringing the family for an extended holiday . - Or until we catch the dirty bugger . - He 's that determined ? Judging by his success , he takes a certain delight in his work . So what brings you on this detour to Washington DC , Inspector ? I figured my friend Mulder ... couldn 't resist a three-pipe problem . I 'll run it by our arson specialist . Splendid . I 'll call London , let them know . Oh , goodbye . Three-pipe problem ? - From Sherlock Holmes. lt 's a private joke . - How private ? We knew each other at school in England . She was brilliant and ... I got in over my head and I ... paid the price . Mulder , you just keep unfolding like a flower . It was over ten years ago , Scully . Yeah . You couldn 't drop everything fast enough to help her out . I was merely extending her a professional courtesy . Oh , is that what you were extending ? I am going to run this by the arson guys , then she 's on her own . Something tells me you 're not going to get rid of her that easily . Beautiful ! Oh , just beautiful ! Look at that . Salmon-red flames . This is 1400 , 1500 degrees . This is a work of art . Was there any kind of incendiary device used ? Yes , actually . The victim 's body . - Spontaneous combustion ? - He was murdered . However , we 've no evidence that tells us how he caught fire . That 's peculiar . People don 't normally just catch on fire . I mean , we burn , but we don 't conduct all that well . There 's usually some extraneous fuel involved , like candle wax , gasoline , something flammable and incendiary that adheres to skin . - Like an accelerant ? - Like an accelerant ! Yes ! But we found no trace , save for magnesium at two sites . That 's aliphatic pyrolysis , a residue from an exothermic reaction . There 's no evidence of the source . No pore pattern or ignition devices . There have been some arson fires in Seattle lately , and Pennsylvania . They burn so hot the firemen can 't put them out . 7,000 degrees . - Hosing that down makes it worse . - How 's that ? Well , the ... reaction is so intense that it splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen . Just adds fuel to the fire . - What were they using ? - We don 't know for sure . Could be rocket fuel . That burns so hot and clean there 's never a trace left . You see , it 's very difficult to prove arson . It 's driving the insurance companies nuts . That 's about the only explanation that I can give you . There are cases of pyrokinetics , people who can control and conduct fire . Well , I 've seen fire bend around corners . I 've seen it bounce like a rubber ball . Fire 's got a certain genius , you know , a certain ... demon poetry . It 's like it 's got a mind of its own . But I 've never seen one that can defy the laws of physics . Not when you figure it out . You 've ... got quite a case for yourself here , Mulder . I almost wish I could be in your shoes . Hey , Jackson ! - Boy , that 's a nice house ! - What a pleasant surprise ! Welcome to America , Sir Malcolm . In here , please . And over there as well . But the second one I want upstairs . Gentlemen , the second set of boxes will go directly up the stairs . - Hello there . - Hello . I 'm Bob , the caretaker . - We 've been exchanging letters . - Oh , hello , Bob ! Excuse the paint . Hi . - Just trying to spruce the place up for you . - Well , it 's delightful . - The photos don 't do itjustice . - Anything I can do for you , anything at all , you just holler . Thank you , Bob . - He seems like a rather nice fellow . - Very . My God , darling ! That painting rather looks like you . Do you think ? Oh , I don 't know . Bloody little cur ! I 'll skin you alive ! You see ? I 'm the caretaker now . So , Sherlock , is the game afoot ? Afraid so , Watson . But you 're off the hook on this one . What do you mean ? I 'm not going to put you through this . - Put me through what ? - Phoebe 's little mind game . What are you talking about ? There 's something else I haven 't told you about myself , Scully . I hate fire . Hate it . I 'm scared to death of it . When I was a kid , my best friend 's house burned down . I had to spend the night in the rubble , to keep away looters . For years I had nightmares about being trapped in a burning building . - And Phoebe knows about this ? - This is classic Phoebe Green . Mind-game player extraordinaire . Ten years , and then she shows up with a case like this . She shows up knowing the power she has over you and makes you walk through fire . Phoebe is fire . Are you sure you don 't want me to help you out on this one ? Sooner or later , a man 's gotta face his demons . Hello . You 're the Marsdens ' driver ? Who 's that ? Bob . The caretaker . Oh . Yeah . - Bum a smoke ? - Yeah , sure . - l 'm going into town . Can I get you anything ? - Some cough medicine , if it 's no problem . Syrup or ... lozenges ? Syrup 'd be good . Can I give you some money ? I appreciate that ! Beer . They don 't let you bring your own around here . I guess they 'll just have to make an exception ... won 't they ? You 're English ! God , I just love that accent ! Allow me . A gentleman , to boot . Oh , my God ! Now , that is a trick ! Hey , guys ! Take a look at this ! Care for a light ? I pulled this report off the wire . A customer in a bar caught fire , but they 're still looking for a body . Any indication an accelerant was used ? The bar is across from a fire station . Burned down before they could respond . It turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake . This is a woman who was in the bar . - Hello . - Hello . - Miss Gotchek ? - Yes . I 'm Special Agent Mulder from the fbi . This is Inspector Green . - Can you tell us what happened in the bar ? - There was this guy . I 'd had a few drinks , so ... He sat next to me and he did this thing . It was like a magic trick where he lit his finger on fire . When I turned around he was up in flames . - Can you describe him ? - Good-looking , I think . Brownish hair . - Long hair ? Short hair ? - l 've already told the police . Could you work with an artist and come up with a sketch ? - l had a few drinks . - Can I get your name and address ? See ... I live with someone . - He thinks I was at school last night . - lt 's no problem . You can come down to the field office and work with somebody . I 'll give you a minute to think about it , OK ? Deftly done , Agent Mulder . Casually disregard her indiscretion . Firm but polite until she co-operates . A technique I refined in my relationship with you . Oh. I see you haven 't lost your sense of humour . I 'm sorry . That was a cheap shot . I don 't want to dredge up the past . - Let 's just stick to the case . - Let 's . - Look , Phoebe ... - Unless I 'm mistaken ten years seems time to have forgiven if not forgotten - a few youthful indiscretions . - l 'm cursed with a photographic memory . Then don 't you tell me that you 've forgotten a certain youthful indiscretion atop Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's tombstone on a misty night in Windlesham . Like I said , let 's just stick to the case . It occurred to me that we 're going to a lot of trouble to find the description of a man who was burnt to a crisp . I would agree , but they haven 't found a body yet . So , can we count on you ? Yeah . OK . I don 't know if it matters but I remembered something else about the guy who caught fire . He had an English accent . Having a rough time , huh ? Maybe it 's the cough syrup . After reviewing the files of the Scotland Yard arson murders , two points remain unexplained . One is the use of an untraceable accelerant . The other involves the victims . Since they all burned in the presence of family members in safe surroundings , this indicates unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist . The arsonist is most likely a male , less than 25 years of age . He will often act out of impulse , satisfying sexual urges or insecurities with destructive behaviour which compensates for social inadequacies or maladjustment . - You boys want to see a magic trick ? - OK . - What 's your names ? - Michael . And Jimmie . - Doesn 't he talk ? - Yes ! - What kind of magic trick ? - Maybe I 'd better not . - Show us ! - You might tell your mom and dad . - We won 't tell . - Really ? - Promise ? - Promise . Hope to die ? Stick a needle in your eye ? OK , boys . You 've taken the solemn oath of trust that can 't be broken , except ... under penalty of death . Watch . - ls it in there ? - No . You 're too smart for me ! - Where did it go ? - Where did it go ? - Where do you think , Jimmie ? - l don 't know . I think I remember . - Do it again ! - You want me to do it again ? OK. I 'll do it again . Agent Beatty ? I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully . - Can I steal a minute of your time ? - Yeah , sure . Come in. I 'm just working on this Mafia torch job here . I 'm ... working with Agent Mulder . Oh , yeah . Wild case . So , what can I do for you ? You said the arsonist might be using some kind of rocket fuel as an accelerant . Just speculation. it doesn 't explain how he sets bodies on fire . What if he got some of this fuel into some hand cream , or ... Well , you 've got to understand that even the smallest amounts of this stuff can produce temperatures over 5,000 degrees . But I suppose it 's not impossible . Extremely diluted . He 'd still have to find a way to ignite it . Wow ! It lit by itself ! Come on . Sit down . So ... - You guys ever smoked a cigarette ? - No , they 're bad for you . Would you like a puff , Michael ? - No . - Make a man out of you . - l don 't want to . - Why don 't you hold one for me ? How about you , Jimmie ? Huh ? Little man ? Jimmie ! Michael ! Hello . Bob ... We 've had a bit of bad news . Our driver has taken ill and we 're due at a party in Boston this evening . is there any chance that we can impose upon you to drive the family into town ? We 'd be happy to pay you for your time and put you up for the night . - l 'd be very happy to do it as a favour . - Good . Thank you . Boys , let 's go . Daddy 's got lunch all ready . The arsonist is usually unmarried and prone to obsessive fantasies about women or men inaccessible to him . The setting of fires results from his cowardice and inability to develop a natural relationship . His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned . The suspicious nature of the fire last night strongly suggests the arsonist has followed Lord Marsden to the United States . A check of all recent immigration to the northeastern area is under way . It has become not a matter of if but when he will strike . - Here 's that immigration data you wanted . - Thank you . You 're welcome . Remember those reports about people who can control and conduct fire ? - Vaguely . - This guy just told us he 's far more exotic . I should say so , if he can set himself on fire . - What ? - l 'm not used to someone so quick to agree . - Oh . - What protection does the family have ? - The driver 's a very capable bodyguard . - He should get more men and limit exposure . There 's a party in their honour tonight in Boston . - They 'll have to cancel . - Unless you want to set a trap . I had thought of that , but we must be careful and discreet . The party 's at eight , at the Venable Plaza . I 'll travel with the family . Why don 't you go on ahead and have a look around ? Oh , and I 've taken a room at the hotel for the night . Thanks . Thank you . - Mulder . - lt 's Scully . Where are you ? - l 'm in Boston . - l 've got something to show you . - l 'm going to come up there . - What have you got ? I might have information on the identity of your arsonist . - Are you there , Mulder ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - Can I meet you somewhere ? It 's just that I 'm kind of anticipating having my hands full . Hey ! We 're here ! - Good evening . - Thank you . - Evening , sir . - Hello . Enjoying yourself ? Good food , witty conversation ... I 'm having the time of my life . I wondered if you think it 's safe enough to indulge ourselves in a dance . It doesn 't look like your arsonist is going to make an appearance . That doesn 't mean there won 't be any fires to put out . I 've thought about you often . There 's a fire upstairs ! - What ? - On the 14th floor . That 's where the children are . You 've got a fire on the 14th floor ! Help us ! Here we go ! We got one down ! Come on , buddy ! Come on ! - Can you walk ? - l got him . - Here we are . - Jimmie ! Michael ! You saved their lives ! - Who is he ? - He 's the driver . Well done ! Good job . You were really out . - Where 's Phoebe ? - She 's down the hall . - What about the kids ? - OK . The doctor checked them out . What happened to you up there ? I panicked . Couldn 't move , Scully . It could have happened to anyone . Yeah . But it happened to me . I haired out . Plain and simple . What do you know about this guy that saved the kids ? The driver ? I checked him out prior to the Marsdens ' arrival . He 's worked on the property for eight years . No record . His references checked out . They were lucky he was here . - Who was watching the kids tonight ? - He was . I could have sworn I saw him in the hall about the time the fire broke out . You couldn 't have . Anyway , our suspect is English . Hey . I came to see if you were OK . - How are the kids ? - They 're fine . Everybody 's anxious to get back . - To the Cape ? - Only to pack . They 're travelling back to England the day after tomorrow . And you ? I 'll be leaving in a few days . I 'll give you a ring back at the Bureau before I leave . Goodbye . Are you OK ? Yeah . Are you at all interested in what I came all the way up here to show you ? Yeah . Well , I did some checking on my own . I didn 't know a whole lot about arson or arsonists , so I took the opportunity . For my own edification , of course . I ran a profile of possible incendiary fuels and accelerants that could have been used in the crimes . I also took the liberty of running a search through Interpol of all the gardeners and domestic help that were hired by the murder victims . - And ? - And ... These people probably don 't even tie their own shoes . There were over 200 names , and not a duplicate ... except one . A Cecil Lively . He worked as a gardener for two of the victims . - What did you find on him ? - Nothing . - So he 's clean ? - Apparently , he was questioned by Scotland Yard and they released him . But I dug a little further . Cecil Lively is a documented citizen of Great Britain . Paid his taxes , never been on the dole ... A model citizen . Until he died in 1971 in a London tenement fire . I know . That 's what I thought . So , I checked a little further . Cecil L 'lvely , spelled L apostrophe , came up again. ln fact , it came up twice . On a list of death certificates , among children who died in ritual sacrifice by a satanic cult in 1963 in the Toddingham Woods outside Bath , England . - Where else did you find it ? - You 're gonna love this . On a list of recent visas issued by the British Government . Cecil L 'lvely 's passport was stamped by US Immigration two weeks ago in Boston . Call the local field office in Boston of the fbi and get them to fax you the composite the witness did . Fax it to every local law enforcement agency . - What are you gonna do ? - Try and catch Phoebe . This guy could be waiting for them at Cape Cod . Yes . This is Special Agent Scully . I 've been waiting on hold for you guys to fax me a composite of an arson suspect . Right . Hang on a second . It 's coming through . Thanks . Oh , my God ! It 's the driver . The cellular customer you are trying to reach is out of the area . Excuse me . His name is Cecil L 'lvely . - Who ? - Your arsonist . Where 's the rest of the family ? - They went outside for a walk . - Well , go find them . We 've got to get them packed and out of here . Come on , hurry ! Let 's go ! It 's the driver . I know . He disappeared . What 's the matter ? Nothing . I found this out in the garage ... It 's been very hard on the family . Did you get the composite ? - Yes . - l don 't believe it. I can 't believe it . - He 's worked for us for over ten years . - Obviously there 's been some mistake . Oh . Oh , my God ! - This isn 't the driver ! It 's the caretaker ! - He 's upstairs with the children ! Michael ! Michael ! Jimmie ! Looks like we 've found the missing driver . Mulder ! In here , quickly ! - What 's going on ? ! - They just went off - all by themselves ! My God ! - Oh , my God ! - Everybody out ! - l think he rigged the whole house . - Oh , no ! It 's fuel . Go ! Go ! Come on ! Move ! Move ! Scully , find a fire extinguisher . - Everybody else , out ! - What about the children ? I 'll take care of the children . Go ! - Are you going to be OK , Mulder ? - Oh , yeah. I 'll be fine . There 's no place I 'd rather be . Michael ! Jimmie ! Are you in there ? Help ! Time to call 911 ? Don 't move ! Freeze ! Federal Agent . You won 't shoot me . Stay right where you are ! See ? Cos you don 't know the spark from that round won 't blow this whole house to kingdom come . Back off , Scully ! It 's the accelerant ! Someone help us ! - Oh , my boys ! My babies ! - Michael ! Jimmie ! Thank God ! Thank God ! You can 't kill me ! You can 't fight fire with fire ! Care to take me to lunch ? Scare you ? You have no idea . Where is Phoebe ? - l don 't know . - You don 't know ? - She didn 't call ? - No . - She did messenger this to me last night . - Did you play it ? - No . - Why not ? Aren 't you curious what 's on it ? Ten to one you can 't dance to it . X-File number 11214893 . Addendum to the file opened by Special Agent Mulder . The arson suspect , Cecil L 'lvely , was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital with fiifth and sixth degree burns over his entire body . Military burns specialists have been brought in to study the case , which they 're calling extraordinary , as the suspect not only survived , but also had rapid regeneration of his basal cell tissue . Full recovery is anticipated in as little as a month . L 'lvely is being held in a high-security medical facility , confined to a hyperbaric chamber until he can be tried for the murder of a Massachusetts caretaker . His body temperature remains at a steady 109 degrees . Health technicians have removed anything flammable from his room due to several fires in the vicinity . According to Agent Mulder , further incarceration remains a problem for federal penal authorities . Can I get you anything , sir ? I 'm just dying for a cigarette .

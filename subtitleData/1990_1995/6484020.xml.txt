 All right . Okay . Here we go . - How are you doing , Rick ? - I 'm doing good . You ? Fine . I like the spring . I think I want to die in the spring . When the world is celebrating the fact that life keeps going on . You 're a little young to be thinking about punching out . I 'll be 71 come November 28th . That 's not too young . Yeah , but ... You 'll bury us all . You want to sign in ? - Do I have any choice ? - Not on this ship you don 't . Good morning , Mr Williams . Please press " enter " . Machines that say " please " make me nervous . Enter thumbprint , please . - Thank you , Mr Williams . - Guess I 'm still me . Have a good one , Rick . Falco employees are invited to take their cars through the disinfectant wash at the end of each day . Thank you . Tell me when you 're clear across the board . I will , Dr Todhunter . - He 's like a kid on prom night . - Yeah , with Uncle Sam 's car . Two billion dollars for a date with a virgin particle accelerator . The least he could do is buy us a corsage . Enough already . Get serious . You know what we 're playing with . I know it . You know it . I just wonder if he knows it . Soon ... Voice identification , please . Harlan Williams , tech number 10884 . Custodian third . Just like yesterday . Thank you , Mr Williams . Uh-oh . - It 's a secondary override . - I know what it is . - Dr Todhunter . - What is it ? I 've got a red light on a secondary override . - Now you 've done it , Ollie . - Shut up . Dear God . - Dr Todhunter , I ... - Be quiet ! Gentlemen , we have a green board . I 'm sorry , Sir , but we don 't . For the record , Sir , we have a red on secondary override delta . Secondary delta override is fine . We have a green board , I tell you . But Dr Todhunter , you can see for yourself . Shut up , Redding . You 're an intern . That means you keep your eyes open and your mouth shut . Understand ? Yes , Sir , Dr Todhunter . - Dr Todhunter , the regulations ... - This is a secondary override switch . Do you follow me ? There . You see ? A bad wire in the go / no-go . Twenty-nine cents worth of trouble . - Yes , but the regulations ... - I know the damn regulations , Jackson . There . You see the light flicker green when I tap it ? A symptom one would associate with a faulty go / no-go ? Do you believe I might just have a point here ? Yes , I agree . Chances are 99 in 100 you 've got a faulty switch . For the record , I am willing to accept full responsibility for proceeding as scheduled . That 's fine , Sir . This is an untested process that requires a great deal of power . And ... Very well . We 'll abort . But in my report of this particular Gold Series test , this Gold Series non-test , I should say , I 'll be careful to spell your name right , Dr Jackson . Very well . Back to work . 14 ... 23 ... and 2 . It 's 32 . 32 . Not 23 . And 2 . Hey , Harlan . How are you doing ? Fine , Billy . How are you ? I signed up for this mail order taxidermy class . Figured I can practice on all them animals zapped by the fence . People pay good money for well-mounted specimens . That 's what the book said . That 's good , Billy . Everybody should have a hobby . We 're still gonna do the floor in the rec area , ain 't we ? I 've got the seal . Sure . Yeah , we are . I opened the windows , like you said . You know , because of the fumes . Good , Billy . That 's good . Sounds like the mad scientists finally got it working . Whatever it is . You want me to wait for you ? I 'll ... I 'll see you there . See ya . Harlan Williams . This is for Harlan Williams . 10884 . Please locate . Williams here . Employee locker room , level four . Please report to administration immediately . - As soon as I finish changing . - Thank you . It is just the light , Tommy . Fine . It 's the light . Scientific history , gentlemen . You were here in the year zero . - Correction . " Ground zero " . - Not funny . Not trying to be . Hello , Mrs Rogers . You wanted to see me ? Major Moreland wants to see you . Major Moreland ? Immediately , Mr Williams . Yes , Sir . Come . - Major Moreland . - Sit down , Williams . What did you want to see me about ? This . I don 't understand . It means that when you took your last physical , you flunked the eye test . Your vision is now below the level set by the Department of Defense for civilian workers . - How much below ? - Just over 6 % . 6 % ? It falls outside the acceptable range . - So I 'm afraid ... - I 'll get new glasses . It wouldn 't matter . - You 're 71 , you know . - 70 . Mr Williams ... Your vision is deficient , even with the glasses . The regulations on this point are clear . Damn right they are . That 's why you haven 't seen the end of it . - What do you mean ? - I mean I can read . I follow all the employee updates . I can retake the eye examination if I want to . Retake the eye exam by all means . - Be my guest . - No , I don 't need to be your guest . - It 's the law . - Ah , yes . " The law " . Commence primary sequence , gentlemen . - What if it 's not just the light ? - Go on , Tommy . Go on ! In three , two , one . Initiate . It was cleaner in the old days . You turned 65 and ... Chop . " Chop " . I see . But the real reason , Mr Williams , is that people get stale . Young blood is the key to success in any business . When I was a kid , my mom would buy a beef roast at least once a month for Sunday dinner . It really cost too much for her budget . But my dad ... He loved a good beef roast more than anything in the world . She would take that roast and she would bring it to the table . And my dad would carve it . I can just see him now . I ... As clear as day . On Monday , my two brothers and I would have cold beef sandwiches in our lunch pails . On Tuesday , we 'd have casserole . Wednesday ... chipped beef on toast . - And on Thursday ... - Major Moreland , I ... I haven 't the foggiest idea what you 're talking about . On Thursdays , Mr Williams , if there was anything left of that roast , my mother threw it away . And we were glad to see it go . Now , my dad didn 't make enough money that we could just chuck beef into the garbage , but ... My mom knew . My mom knew that meat only keeps so long . After a while , it gets randy . And randy meat can make you sick . You 're a jerk . Do you know that ? A total worthless jerk . It 's been my experience when people say such things , Mr Williams , meaningful discussion has come to an end . I am not a roast of beef ! Secondary sequence ! Go on , Tommy . More power than a supernova . God help us if it goes wrong . Nothing 's going to go wrong . Tertiary sequence , right now ! Dr Todhunter , I 've got reds on primary overrides ! Dr Todhunter ! Dr Todhunter ! Overload across the board ! Shut it down ! He 's on another planet . Shut it down ! You want to die ? Shut it down ! No response on the primaries . We burned out busses as well as overrides . Then shut it all down . Pull the plug ! Don 't do that ! Do you know how long it will take to power up ? Don 't you get it ? This place will go sky high ! Help us , for God 's sake ! You son of a bitch ! Now you 've done it . Calling him names . We 're fired for sure . No need to panic . Everyone remain calm . Stay at your stations ! I think we got it . I think maybe we did . Wait a minute . A local news bulletin . A grain silo exploded at Falco Plains Agricultural Testing Station . A spokeswoman for the facility said there were no injuries . An update on the hour . Falco Plains . - Hello . I 'd like to ... - Sorry , all our circuits are busy . Please try again later . Thank you . - Mrs Williams ? - Yes . I 'm Terry Spann , Head of Security at Falco Plains . May we come in ? Is my husband all right ? I heard on the radio ... - Are you alone ? - Yes . - Only you and your husband live here ? - Yes . Is my husband all right ? All I know is that he was injured in an accident . Please , Mrs Williams , we 'd like you to come with us . No . I 'm not going anywhere until you tell me what 's happened to Harlan . I don 't know all the details . I was told to come get you and bring you to the hospital . But don 't you know ... ? Can 't you tell me ... ? Is ... Is Harlan dead ? Do you have a purse ? - I want this place wired . Tonight . - You got it . All emergency personnel must report to Annexe M for sani-wash before leaving the facility . Thank you . Lieutenant McGiver , we 've got a body over here . Is it Dr Jackson or Dr Redding ? I can 't tell , Sir . All right . Bag him . Holy Mother , the power is still on ! What are they trying to do ? Blow us up ? The panel is over there . What 's your reading ? It 's negative radiation , Sir . That wasn 't what they were playing with . What were they playing with ? Non-lethal biological material . Then why are we wearing these freaking suits ? You can take yours off if you 'd be more comfortable , Private . Let 's spread out . There 's another one in here somewhere . Coming through , little fella . Come here . Here , Sir . I found this . Maybe he can tell us what happened . Take him to the clean room . They 'll want to run some tests . Over here , Lieutenant McGiver . I 've got a live one . Who is it ? It 's Dr Redding , Lieutenant . - How do you know ? - I found his ID tag . Secondary delta override ... We had a no-go light . Dr Todhunter ... What about Dr Todhunter ? I can 't quite hear you , man . What about Dr Todhunter ? Told us to go ahead anyhow . Ordered us . I want to make absolutely sure I 'm understanding you , mister . You had a red light , and Todhunter told you to go ahead anyway ? Ain 't that a bitch ? That 's affirmative . Alert the hospital , soldier . We have a possible Alpha One hazard . General Crewes , I 've received word that Miss Spann 's car is approaching the gate . Slow down ! Smart girl . I 'm going down in the infirmary . Let me know when Todhunter shows up . Yes , Sir , General . Infirmary personnel , Emergency Procedure 721A is now in effect . I 'll arrange a room for you , if you like . - A room ? What for ? - You might want to spend the night . Right now , all I want is to see my husband . Why don 't you sit down there and I 'll see what I can find out . What 's the situation here ? Never used to be able to sneak up on you like this , Terry . - That her ? - How 's her husband ? Mrs Williams , I 'm the boss here , General Crewes . This place is my responsibility . Would you please sit down ? Relax . Your husband 's alive . There 's nothing for you to worry about . This is a first-rate hospital . Your husband 's getting the best of care . - How bad is it ? - Nothing serious . - Can I see him ? - Well , he 's resting now . I don 't need to talk to him . I just want to see him . If you want to wait a couple of hours , when the doctors say you can see him . He 's really all right . I 've seen him myself . There 's nothing for you to worry about . Are you hungry ? I can have some food sent down . We have a good restaurant in the building . What was that ? - What ? - That space suit . It 's just a precaution against ... infection . Mrs Williams , would you excuse us for a moment ? General Crewes . - You want to level with me ? - About what ? I get an emergency call on my way to Washington . What 's going on ? There 's really nothing to say . Great , Louis . I tell the press we 've got a grain silo explosion . You 've got guys running around in doomsday suits . We 're running some tests . So far , there 's nothing to worry about . We 're just playing it safe . Okay ? - You 're sure ? - Trust me . You 're all right ? You need something ? - I 'm looking for the bathroom . - It 's that way . Somebody stop her ! Wait . Wait ! Stop ! - Is it safe ? - Don 't move . I 'll check . Harlan ? Can you hear me ? It 's me . Gina . Over here . You 're not allowed in here ! - Oh , Harlan ! - I 'm all right . Oh , my sweet . I 'm fine . What 's wrong with my husband ? Nothing , Mrs Williams . Nothing at all . What time do you have ? It 's five minutes later than the last time you asked . I thought I had an appointment . I 'm sure the General will see you as soon as he possibly can . Why don 't you buzz him ? Let him know I 'm waiting ? He knows you 're here , Dr Todhunter . When the General wants you , he 'll buzz you . Would you like a magazine ? I don 't appreciate being treated this way . - What way ? - Being lied to . You son of a bitch . You owe me an explanation . If we 'd spent more time together , this wouldn 't have happened . What about dinner tonight ? I bet you have a big appetite . This is serious , Louis . I can 't do my job if I don 't know what 's going on . Talk to me . - You want to go non-reg for a minute ? - Yeah . - This is a mess . - I 'll drink to that . I 'm sorry . I 've been out of the loop on this one . He 's the only guy that knows what we 've got . Great . Where do they find these lunatics ? I think he 's from Stanford . All right . Tell me what you do know . Last year , before you came on board , the DSA dropped two Black Budget projects in my lap . The Gold Series was given carte blanche . Todhunter runs it . It has some military application . What exactly , I 'm not sure . That 's all I know . So what 's the green stuff ? You 'd have to ask him . How do we know if he 's telling the truth ? This is how . Arlington gave me the clearance to open the file . Darla , tell the doctor we 'll be a few minutes more . - And that I appreciate his patience . - Yes , General . This makes me hungry . I thought it would . That 's the stuff that came out when the lab exploded . God had his hand on you , Harlan . God ran over me . Somebody did . Knocked me over trying to get away . That 's why I was in the hallway when the lab blew . If I 'd made it inside , I 'd be looking like my friend over there . - You 've always been lucky . - Yeah . A lucky man who gets blown up and fired , all on the same day . - Fired ? - I flunked the eye exam on my physical . Maybe it 's time you thought about retiring . I 'm not ready to hang it up yet . - I 've a right to retake that eye exam . - All right . - A man 's got to have his work . - All right . Let 's talk about this later . Mr Williams , I need to wash the rest of you now . Yes , fine . Wait a minute . You 're not going to wash that , are you ? Yes . Excuse me , but there 's some things I 'm sort of used to washing myself . I can get the male nurse , if you 'd be more comfortable . No . No , that 's ... That 's all right . I 'll do it . I ... You give me the sponge . I 'll manage . I 'm afraid there are some places you can 't reach . Well , I guess it 's you and me , then . I 'll handle this . It 's all right , Mother . She 's trained to do it . I 've had more experience cleaning dirty old men than this young thing . - Will you excuse us ? - Call if you need any help . - Don 't scrub so hard . - Sorry . You always had the funniest legs . And am I glad to see them again . Oh , hey ... I love you . I 'm increasing the dose to 10 ccs . - I want you to call if anything changes . - Yes , Sir . Infirmary staff , please note . The annual picnic will be held on July 17th . Rain or shine . Thank you . I don 't appreciate being kept waiting . I don 't have time to waste . I should be in my lab now , assessing the damage . We won 't be too long , Dr Todhunter . I just want to ask you a few questions . There 's going to be a formal enquiry . Why repeat myself ? This is an informal enquiry . You 'd be more comfortable talking about it with us instead of to a roomful of bean counters . Why this woman is attending is beyond my comprehension . Well , let me see if I can simplify it for you . I 'm Head of Security at Falco Plains . Your lab blew up . It 's my job to find out why . - You can comprehend that . - The Gold Series is classified . I 'm not at liberty to discuss it with just anyone . You 're not a liberty not to discuss it . - You 're recording this . - On three different machines . What is it you want to know in advance of my official report ? We want to know the things that won 't be in your report . I have nothing to hide . Everybody 's got something to hide . The talk I hear about you is ... Why don 't we just start with the simple facts , Richard . What have you been up to lately ? Experimenting with regeneration . Attempting to accelerate the healing process in living tissue . - What 's the military interest ? - The battlefield . Wounded soldiers return to the front in record time . Lose a finger and grow it back . - Just like a frog . - Terry . On the humanitarian side , it could mean the end of disease . The postponement of death . Truly a new world order . May I have a glass of water , please ? So ... What 's the green stuff ? I call it KR3 . It 's the by-product of a harmless chemical reaction . Harmless ? Completely . May I have another glass of water , please ? You 're sure we ought to be doing this ? It 'll take forever with that little sponge . If you 're strong enough to kiss me like that , you 're strong enough to shower . There 's no ... What are you doing ? I 'm joining you . To get those places you can 't reach . Well , there 's lots of places I can 't reach . Ready or not , here I come . He 's losing it . I 'm supposed to be doing your back . - Oh , God . I 'll get the crash wagon . - Don 't bother . He was dead when the GIs brought him . He just hadn 't stopped breathing . Let 's get him out of here . The autopsy 's going to have to wait until the investigatory team arrives .

 When Allen died .. ... it was like the whole world came crashing down . My only son . What could be worse ? And then a year later Joe , my husband had a stroke . 'Both of them gone . ' How could you go on ? I had my work .. ... and my faith . Faith ? In something bigger . In a power beyond this world ... that watches over us . And works through us . Even in .. Especially in the darkest times . I don 't think , I 'm ready for philosophy yet . Now philosophy has nothing to do with it . It 's not about words in a book .. ... or a bearded guard on a throne somewhere . It 's about people . Normal people like you and me . Normal people ? Helping each other and our world . The way we 've been able to help you . 'That 's what this lab grew out of . ' Weak as a kid . All your strength gone . No rhyme , no reason . Everything spinning out of control . Running down ... even you . In my heart of hearts , I hope you believe you can stop me . Now , look at you . The boy of steel . The champion of the downtrodden . You 're a joke . ( man on TV ) 'The following is a forced 'Are you all getting this ? ' 'Do you understand now ? ' 'Either you embrace the Chaos , or you drown . ' 'I was like him once . ' 'I bought the whole package . ' I believed in hopes , dreams .. ... power of science to create a utopian future where there 'll be no wars . Starvation ... destruction of the ecosystem . I was gonna save the whole planet , all by myself . I know him . He came here looking for funding . He 's brilliant , passionate but he 's so impatient . You can bleed for the world for just so long .. ... before it takes it 's toll . I was working on a new non-polluting fuel . My lab exploded . 'My world went up in flaming Chaos . ' That 's when I realized what a fool I 've been . Trying to save a planet spiraling into madness . The only solution was to become one with the madness . So I could clear the end of an old era and the dawn of a new age , the age of Chaos . And it begins at midnight tonight when I climb to the top of the tallest building in Capitol City the Maywood Tower and toss this pathetic symbol of all your false beliefs to his well-deserved death . Aw-w-w ! [ claps ] Things fall apart . So ... my boys and girls sleep tight if you can . Oh , here 's a preview of your dreams . [ explosion ] [ tires screeching ] How the mighty have fallen ! You really thought , you were gonna keep flying on forever didn 't you , Mr. Goodness in virtue Mr. Immune to the insanity . Beginning to catch on now , aren 't you ? Aren 't you ? [ dramatic music ] You idiot ! Do you realize what you 've done ? All my plans .. [ laughing ] Things fall apart . Well , I 'll never make it to the tower on foot so I might as well just go back to the Paradiso . - One roof 's as good as another . - Chaos ! It lives , it breathes , it speaks . Let ... me help . After all I 've done to you . [ sizzling ] It 's a good thing we 're finishing you off tonight . You 'll never last a minute in my new world . [ intense music ] ( Lana ) 'They did ? Where was it ? ' Okay , thanks . I 'll be right there . Where 're you going ? The Police found Chaos 's car . It was wrecked . - Was anybody injured ? - No , it was empty . - But I 'm going there right now . - You can 't . Matt ! You know , I 'm going to go . Jackson said , I have to report you if I see you leaving again . Now , what am I supposed to do ? Don 't look . What do you know ? Loose laces ! I better tighten 'em up before I trip . I knew the technology would have some side effects . But nothing this bad . And I have no way of knowing whether Superboy 's weakened state is temporary or permanent . Not that it 'll matter if he goes off that building . Dammit ! I wish I paid more attention to those dizzy spells . It 's hopeless . If we could just get him back here . How ? Right now we need Superboy just to save Superboy . Or someone with his power . Bizarro ? The process ... could be reversed . And then afterwards , you can change me back ? The technology is too unpredictable . You 've seen what 's happened already . Then I won 't do it . There are police out there , National Guard . 'Let them save him . ' Let them stop Chaos . I 'm not telling you what to do Bill . Why does it have to be me ? This life , this world , if I go back to what I was I 'll loose everything . Who you are , isn 't in the way in the way you look .. ... or talk or think . It 's in here . Can you stand there and tell me that , if I let you do this that people won 't look at me as if I 'm some hideous monster . Some inhuman thing ? [ melancholic music ] This has to be Superboy 's doing . Only his heat vision could possibly do something like that . It 's some prank , lady . It 's probably the name of a rock band . Look , I got to get over to the tower , I 'm sorry . They 're not at the tower . There 's an old hotel , The Paradiso . It 's been abandoned for years . Look , I got more important things to worry about tonight than some stupid prank . Why won 't you listen to me ? [ melancholic music ] How did you know ? Oh , when I 'm hurting or confused .. ... I 'll go out and talk to Allen and Joe . I thought maybe you 'd do the same thing . I still miss her . I loved her so much .. ' ... and she loved me . ' No judgment , no conditions just an open caring heart . She was a hideous monster . An inhuman thing . No ! She was ... just .. [ music continues ] [ dramatic music ] 'Don 't ! ' [ Chaos laughing ] Oh , no ! No , no , no .. See , you of all people should understand . You go out there , day after day , bleeding for humanity . Trying to make a difference . Look at the world .. For all you 've done , nothing 's changed . Ah-ho-o-o ! No , answer . Because you know , I 'm right . Well , after you 're gone , they 'll all know , I 'm right . If I have to level this entire city , they 'll know . [ dramatic music ] Now , that was really stupid . No , really . That was really .. [ laughing ] Come on in . Oh , I think a friend of yours is here . ( Lana ) Superboy ! You see , is she what I mean ? You think , you 're about to win ? You think , you 've got all the pieces nicely fitted into place ? I 'm Chaos . [ whirring ] Let 's go . [ intense music ] Goodbye , Allen . Midnight ! The dawn of a new age ! I swear to you little girl , I will blow you to pieces and believe me , I know what that feels like . It 's not very pleasant . Farewell to paradise . [ grunts ] ( Lana ) Ah-h ! [ grunts ] [ music continues ] Ah-h ! Ah , things fall apart . It 's , um , over . You are saving him ? Look at yourself . Look at me . You 're not a part of his world , you 're a part of mine . Part of the Chaos . Join me . We 're two of a kind .. Brothers . Me only have one .. ... brother . ( Lana ) Are you alright ? [ slow music ] Thanks . Me did , what me had to do . Now , me freak again . You 're as human a soul as I 've ever known . Wait ! Where do you think you 're going ? We 've got a lot of work ahead of us . A , is for apple .. ... aunty ... alligator . Hm .. A , um , for apple .. ... aunty and a-a , a- - ( together ) Al-li-ga-tor . That 's good . That 's really good . Well , me .. Well , I have good teachers . [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

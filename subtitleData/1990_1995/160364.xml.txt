 Mmm-mmm , yes . Loveyou . I loveyou . Hello . Good morning , sir . Ah , good morning . Good morning , Cecil . Top ofthe morning toyou . Thankyou . Good-bye , darling . Woman : Good-bye , Charles . What time can I expectyou ? Before supper . ( screaming ) Man : Put it out ! Put it out ! I forgot what it 's like to spend a day in court . That 's one ofthe luxuries to hunting down aliens and genetic mutants . You rarely get to press charges . It 's opened . What ? It 's unlocked . That 's weird . I 'm sure I locked it . Must be an X-File . ( chuckling ) What 's that ? I told you I locked the door . What doyou think it is ? Ten to one you can 't dance to it . Woman : Greetings , Agent Mulder . Six months ago , British Minister of Parliament Reggie Ellicott received an audiocassette , much like the oneyou 're listening to now . Unfortunately , when he popped the tape into the car stereo he armed a device which , when he tried to exit the car created an explosion which was heard five miles away . The Scotland Yard forensic team could only identify the poor bastard by his dental records . Ifonly he hadn 't reached for the door handle and triggered the detonator . But then how was he to know he was sitting on enough plastique explosive to lift the car 40 feet in the air and deposit the engine block on top ofa three-story building ? ( gasps ) ( gasps ) Aren 't we looking rather ghostly ? It 's an old friend . Aren 'tyou going to thank me ? Forwhat ? Saving your life . One tends not to make the same mistake twice . I 'll try to remember that . Oh , come on . Don 't tell meyou left your sense ofhumor in Oxford ten years ago . No . Actually , it 's one ofthe few things you didn 't drive a stake through . Some mistakes are quite worth making twice . Dana Scully , this is Phoebe Greene . The terror ofScotland Yard . Hello . Hello . She hates me . What brings you to the colonies ? Some clever bloke has been giving the aristocracy a good scare . Killed offa ranking member of Parliament or three . Set Windsor Castle ablaze in ' 92 . Your car bomber ? No . This one likes to burn his victims alive . Can 't figure out how he does it . Not a crumb ofevidence at the crime scene . The last one died in his front garden . His pooryoung wife watching helplessly as he went up in smoke . The Irish Republican Army ? Our suspect likes to send love letters to his victims ' wives . Sent one to the wife of Sir Malcolm Marsden a month ago . Three days later he narrowly escaped a fire in his garage . Burned to the ground . So they 're renting a place out on Cape Cod . Bringing the family to the States for an extended holiday or until we catch the dirty bugger . He 's that determined ? judging by his success , he takes certain delight in his work . So what brings you on this detour to Washington , D.C. , lnspector ? I figured my friend , Mulder couldn 't resist a three-pipe problem . I 'll run it by our arson specialist . Splendid . I 'll call London . Let them know . Oh , good-bye . Three-pipe problem ? That 's from Sherlock Holmes . It 's a privatejoke . How private ? Um ... we knew each other in school in England . She was brilliant and I got in over my head and paid the price . Mulder , youjust keep unfolding like a fower . That was over ten years ago , Scully . Yeah , I noticed howyou couldn 't drop everything fast enough in order to help her out . I was merely extending her a professional courtesy . Oh , is that whatyou were extending ? I 'm going to run this by the arson guys and then she 's on her own . Something tells me you 're not going to get rid ofher that easily . Beautiful . Oh , just beautiful . Look at that . Salmon red fames . This is 1 , 400-1 , 500 degrees . This is a work ofart . Was there any kind ofincendiary device used ? Yes , actually , the victim 's body . Spontaneous combustion ? He was murdered however , we 've turned up no evidence that tells us how the body caught fire . That 's peculiar . People don 't normally just catch on fire . I mean , we burn , but we don 't conduct that well . There 's usually some extraneous fuel involved like candle wax , gasoline- - Something fammable and incendiary that adheres to the skin . Like an accelerant . Like an accelerant . Yes . We 've found nothing save for a dusting ofmagnesium . That 's aliphatic pyrolysis . It 's a residue from an exothermic reaction . But there 's no evidence ofthe source . No pour pattern or ignition devices . There have been some arson fires in Seattle and Pennsylvania . It burns so hot that the firemen can 't put them out . 7,000 degrees . Hosing that down makes it worse . How 's that ? The reaction is so intense that it splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen . Itjust adds fuel to the fire . What were they using ? We don 't know for sure . It could be rocket fuel . It burns so hot and clean there 's never a trace left . It 's very difficult to prove arson . It 's driving the insurance companies nuts . It 's about the only explanation that I can giveyou . There have been cases ofpyrokinetics . People who can control and conduct fire . Well , I 've seen fire bend around corners . Seen it bounce like a rubber ball . Fire has got a certain genius , you know . A certain demon poetry . It 's like it 's got a mind ofits own . But I 've never seen one that can defy the laws ofphysics not when you figure it out . You 've , uh ... got quite a case foryourselfhere , Mulder . I almost wish I could be in your shoes . ( car approaching ) Hey , Jackson . Boy , that 's a nice house . What a pleasant surprise . Welcome to America , Sir Malcolm . Man : From the top there , hand them down . Marsden : Thankyou . I 'm delighted to be here . Where 's the dog ? Darling , you happy ? You like the house ? TakeJackson , yes . ( chattering ) ( Jackson barking ) Right there . In here , please . Thankyou . And over there as well . But the second one , I want upstairs . Gentlemen , the second set ofboxes will go up the stairs . Thankyou very much . Hello there . Hello . I 'm Bob , the caretaker . We 've been exchanging letters . Oh , good heavens , yes , ofcourse . Excuse the paint . Hi . just trying to spruce the place up foryou . It 's delightful . The photos don 't do itjustice . Anything I can do foryou , anything at all youjust holler . Thankyou , Bob . Thanks . Seems like a rather nice fellow , don 'tyou think ? Very . My God , darling , that painting rather looks likeyou . Don 'tyou think ? Oh , I don 't know . I 've never been good at this . ( Jackson whimpering ) ( yelps , barks ) Bloody little cur . I 'll skin you alive . You see ? I 'm the caretaker now . So , Sherlock , is the game afoot ? I 'm afraid so , Watson . Butyou 're off the hook on this one . What doyou mean ? I 'm not going to putyou through this . Put me through what ? Phoebe 's little mind game . What areyou talking about ? There 's something else I haven 't told you about myself , Scully . ( sighs ) I hate fire . Hate it . Scared to death ofit . ( sighs ) When I was a kid my best friend 's house burned down . Had to spend the night in the rubble to keep away looters . Foryears I had nightmares about being trapped in a burning building . Wait . Phoebe knows about this ? This is classic Phoebe Greene , mind game player extraordinaire . Ten years it 's taken me to forget her and she shows up with this case . She shows up knowing the power she has overyou and then makes you walk through fire ? Phoebe is fire . Mulder , areyou sureyou don 't want me to helpyou out ? Sooner or later , a man 's got to face his demons . ( coughing ) ( coughing ) Hello . You 're the Marsdens ' driver ? Who 's that ? Bob . Caretaker . Oh . Bum a smoke ? Yeah , sure . I 'm going into town . Can I getyou anything ? Yeah , some cough medicine . Syrup or lozenges ? Syrup would be good . Can I giveyou some money ? Appreciate that . Beer . They don 't letyou bring your own around here . ( British accent : ) Well , I guess they 'll just have to make an exception won 't they ? Oh , you 're English . God , I just love that accent . Allow me . And a gentleman to boot . Oh , my God . Now that is a trick . Hey , guys . Take a look at this . Care for a light ? ( screaming ) I pulled this report offthe wire . Eyewitnesses are saying that a customer in the bar caught fire . They 're looking for a body . Any indication an accelerant was used ? The bar 's across from a fire station . It burned to the ground before they could even respond . It burned so hot it turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake . This woman was in the bar . Hello ? Hello . Miss Patrick ? I 'm Special Agent Mulder from the F.B.I. This is Inspector Greene . Can you tell us what happened in the bar last night ? There was this guy . I 'd had a few drinks so ... He sat next to me and he did this thing . It was like a magic trick where he lit his finger on fire . Next thing I turned around he was up in fames . Can you describe him ? Good-looking , I think . Brownish hair . Long hair , short hair ? I gave the police the information . Doyou thinkyou could work with a composite artist ? I had a few drinks ... Can I getyour full name and address ? See ... I live with someone . He thinks I was at school last night . It 's no problem . You can come down ... to the office and workwith somebody there . I 'll giveyou a minute to think about it , okay ? Deftly done , Agent Mulder . Casually disregard her indiscretion . Firm but polite manner until she accedes to cooperate . It 's a technique I refined in my relationship with you . Oh , I seeyou haven 't lost your sense ofhumor after all . I 'm sorry . That was a cheap shot . I don 't want to dredge up the past . Let 'sjust stick to the case . Let 's . Look ... Unless I 'm mistaken ten years seems sufficient time to have forgiven ifnot forgotten a fewyouthful indiscretions . I 'm cursed with a photographic memory . Then don 'tyou tell me thatyou 've forgotten a certain youthful indiscretion atop SirArthur Conan Doyle 's tombstone on a misty night in Windlesham . Like I said , let 'sjust stick to the case . It occurred to me that we 're going to a lot oftrouble to find a description ofa man who in all likelihood has been burned to a crisp . I would agree with you , but they haven 't found a bodyyet . So can we count on you ? Yeah , okay . Thanks . I don 't know ifit matters but I remembered something else about the guywho caught fire . He had an English accent . ( coughing ) Having a rough time , huh ? Maybe it 's the cough syrup . Scully : After reviewing the files ofthe Scotland Yard arson murders two points remain unexplained . One is the use of an untraceable accelerant . The other involves the victims . Since they all burned in the presence offamily members in safe surroundings this indicates unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist . The arsonist is most likely a male , less than 25 years ofage . He will often act out ofimpulse satisfying sexual urges or insecurities with destructive behavior which compensates for his social inadequacies or maladjustments . You boys want to see a magic trick ? Okay . What 's your names ? Michael andJimmie . Doesn 't he talk ? Yes . What kind ofmagic trick ? Maybe I 'd better not . Show us . You might tell your parents . We won 't . Really ? Promise ? Promise . Hope to die- - stick a needle in your eye ? Okay , boys . You 've taken the solemn oath that can 't be broken except under penalty ofdeath . Watch . Is it in there ? No . You 're too smart for me . Where did it go ? Where doyou think ? I don 't know . I think I remember . ( grunting ) Ta-da ! Ooh ! Do it again . Okay , I 'll do it again . ( knocking ) Agent Beatty ? I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully . Can I steal a minute ofyour time ? Sure , I 'm just working on this Mafia torchjob here . I 'm working with Agent Mulder . Oh , yeah , wild case . So , what can I do foryou ? You mentioned that the arsonist might be using some kind ofrocket fuel as an accelerant . It still doesn 't explain how he sets bodies on fire . What ifhe got some ofthis fuel into some hand cream or ... Well , you 've got to understand even the smallest amounts ofthis stuff can produce temperatures over 5,000 degrees . But I suppose it 's not impossible . Extremely diluted . Butyou still have to find a way to ignite it . Wow ! It lit by itself ! . Come on , sit down . So , you guys ever smoked a cigarette ? No . They 're bad foryou . Would you like to take a puff ? No . Make a man out ofyou . I don 't want to . Why don 'tyou hold one for me ? How aboutyou , Jimmie ? Huh , little man ? Woman : Jimmie , Michael . Hello . Bob . Thereyou are . We 've had a bit ofbad news . Our driver has taken ill and we 're due at a party in Boston this evening . Is there any chance that we can impose upon you to drive the family into town ? We would payyou foryour time and putyou up for the night . I 'd be happy to do it as a favor . Thankyou . Boys , let 's go . Daddy 's got lunch ready . jimmie , you 're filthy . Scully : The arsonist is usually unmarried and prone to obsessive fantasies about women or men ... who are inaccessible to him . Often the setting offires results from his cowardice and inability to develop a natural relationship . His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned . The suspicious nature ofthe fire last night strongly suggests the arsonist has followed Lord Marsden to the United States . A check ofrecent immigration to the Northeastern area is underway . It has become not a matter ofif , but when he will strike . Man : Here 's that immigration data you wanted . Thankyou . You 're welcome . Remember those reports about people who control and conduct fire- - pyrokinetics ? Vaguely . I think this guy sent us a message that he 's more exotic . I should say so , ifhe can set himselfafire . - ( laughs ) - What ? I 'm just not used to someone so quick to agree with me . What protection does the family have ? The driver 's a very capable bodyguard . He should get additional men and limit public exposure . They 've got a party in their honor tonight in Boston . They 'll have to cancel . Unless you wanted to set a trap . I had thought ofthat . But we must be careful and discreet . The party 's at 8 : 00 at the Venable Plaza . I 'll be traveling with the family so why don 'tyou go ahead and look around ? I 've taken a room at the hotel for the night . Thanks . Good night . Thankyou . ( phone ringing ) Mulder . It 's Scully . Where areyou ? I 'm in Boston . I 've got something to showyou . I 'm coming up there . What haveyou got ? I might have some information on your arson suspect . ( clears throat ) Areyou there , Mulder ? Yeah . Yeah . Can I meetyou somewhere ? No , it 'sjust , I 'm kind ofanticipating having my hands full . Hey , we 're here ! Thankyou . Let 's go inside . Evening , sir . Hello . Enjoying yourself ? There 's good food , witty conversation . I 'm having the time ofmy life . I wondered ifyou think it 's safe enough to indulge ourselves in a dance ? Doesn 't look likeyour arsonist is going to make an appearance . That doesn 't mean there won 't be any fires to put out . I 've thought aboutyou often . ( beeping ) There 's a fire upstairs . What ? On the 1 4th foor . That 's where the children are . You 've got a fire on the 1 4th foor . ( alarm ringing ) Boys : Help ! Help ! ( coughing ) Hurry up ! Here we are . ( coughing ) Here we are . Got one down . Come on , buddy . Come on . Hereyou go . Can you walk ? Can you get him ? I got him . Hold on ! Here we are . Mommy ! jimmie ! Michael ! Areyou all right ? You saved their lives . Who is he ? He 's the driver . Thanks . Thanks . Well done . Goodjob . Thankyou . ( coughing ) You were really out . Where 's Phoebe ? She 's down the hall . What about the kids ? Okay . The doctor checked them out . What happened toyou up there ? I panicked . Couldn 't even move , Scully . It could have happened to anyone . Yeah ... but it happened to me . I haired out ... plain and simple . What doyou know about this guy that saved the kids- - the driver ? I checked him out prior to the Marsdens ' arrival . He 's worked on the property for eightyears . No record . His references checked out . Theywere lucky he was here tonight . Who was watching the kids ? He was . I could have sworn I saw him in the hall about the same time the fire broke out . You couldn 't have . Anyway , the man we 're looking for is English . Hey . I came to see ifyou were okay . How are the kids ? They 're fine . Everybody 's anxious to get back . To the Cape ? They 've made travel arrangements back to England for the day after tomorrow . And you ? I 'll be leaving in a few days . Look , I 'll giveyou a ring back at the Bureau before I leave . Good-bye . You okay ? Yeah . You at all interested in what I came all the way up here to showyou ? Yeah . Well , I did some checking on my own . I didn 't know a whole lot about arson or arsonists so I took the opportunity for my own edification , ofcourse . I ran a profile ofpossible incendiary fuels and accelerants that could have been used in the crimes . I also took the liberty ofrunning a search through Interpol ofall the gardeners , manservants and domestic help that were hired by the murdervictims at the time oftheir deaths . And .. ? These people probably don 't even tie their own shoes . There were over 200 names and not a duplicate ... except one . A Cecil Lively . He worked as a gardener for two ofthe victims . And what did you find on him ? Nothing . So he 's clean . He was questioned by Scotland Yard and they released him , but I dug a little further . Cecil Lively is a documented citizen ofGreat Britain , paid his taxes never been on the dole , a model citizen- - until he died in 1 971 in a London tenement fire . I know . That 's what I thought . So , I checked a little further . Cecil L 'lvely , spelled " L " apostrophe , came up again . In fact , it came up twice- - First , on a list ofdeath certificates listed among a group ofchildren who died in ritual sacrifice by a satanic cult in 1 963 in the Tottingham Woods outside Bath , England . Where else did you find it ? You 're going to love this . On a list ofrecent visas issued by the British government . Cecil L 'lvely 's passport was stamped by U.S. immigration officials two weeks ago at the port ofentry in Boston . Call the local field office in Boston ofthe F.B.I. and get them to faxyou the composite the witness did ofthe man who burned down the bar . Then get them to fax it to every local law agency . What areyou going to do ? I 'm going to try and catch Phoebe . This guy could be waiting for them in Cape Cod . Yes , this is Special Agent Scully . I 've been waiting on hold foryou guys to fax me a composite ofan arson suspect . Right . Hang on a second . It 's coming through . Thanks . Oh , my God . It 's the driver . The cellular customer you are trying to reach is out ofthe area . ( clearing throat ) Excuse me . His name is Cecil L 'lvely . Who ? Your arsonist . Where 's the rest ofthe family ? Theywent outside for a walk . Well , go find them . We 've got to get them packed and get them out ofhere . Come on . We have to hurry . I 'm sorry , children . We have to leave right away . Can 't we stay one more day ? Please , Mother , can 't we stay one more day ? We 're having so much fun . We 're having so much fun . ( knocking ) It 's the driver . I know . He disappeared . What 's the matter ? Nothing . Um , I found this out in the garage . Nothing . Um , I found this out in the garage . It 's been very hard on the family . Did you get the composite ? Yes . I don 't believe it . I can 't believe it . He 's worked for us for over ten years . Obviously there 's been some type ofmistake . Oh . Oh , my God ! This isn 't the driver . It 's the caretaker . Lady Marsden : And he 's upstairs with the children . Michael ! Jimmie ! Michael ? Michael ! jimmie ? ! Looks like we found the missing driver . Phoebe : Mulder ! ln here ! Quickly ! What 's going on ? Theyjust went up all by themselves ! What about the boys ? My God ! Good God ! Everybody out ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! I think he rigged the whole house . Oh , no ! It 's fuel . - What ? ! - My God ! Go ! Go ! Get downstairs . Scully , see ifyou can find a fire extinguisher . Everybody else , outside . But what about the children ? ( thudding , Jackson barking ) I 'll take care ofthe children . Go ! Will you be okay , Mulder ? Oh , yeah . I 'll be fine . There 's no place I 'd rather be . ( thudding , Jackson barking ) Michael ? ! Jimmie ? ! You in there ? ! ( boys yelling ) Time to call 91 1 . Don 't move ! Freeze ! Federal agent . You won 't shoot me . Stay right whereyou are . You see ? Becauseyou don 't know that the spark from that round won 't blow this whole house to kingdom come . Back off , Scully . It 's the accelerant ! No ! No ! ( boys screaming ) Michael ! Jimmie ! Thank God ! ( laughing ) You can 't kill me . ( laughing ) You can 't fight fire with fire . ( laughing ) ( clicking ) Care to take me to lunch ? Scareyou ? You have no idea . Where is Phoebe ? I don 't know . You don 't know . She didn 't call ? No . She did messenger this to me last night , though . Did you play it ? No . Why not ? Aren 'tyou curious what 's on it ? Ten to one you can 't dance to it . Scully : X-File number 1 1 21 4893 . Addendum to the file opened by Special Agent Mulder . The arson suspect Cecil L 'lvely was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital ... with fifth and sixth degree burns over his entire body . Military burn specialists have been brought in to study the case which they 're calling extraordinary not only for the fact the suspect survived but for the rapid regeneration ofhis basal cell tissue . Full recovery is anticipated in as little as a month . Scully : L 'lvely is being held in a high-security medical facility confined to a hyperbaric chamber until he can be tried on murder charges in the death ofa Massachusetts caretaker . His body temperature remains at a steady 1 09 degrees . Health technicians have removed anything fammable from his room due to several fires which have broken out in the vicinity . According to Agent Mulder further incarceration remains a problem for federal penal authorities . Can I getyou anything , sir ? I 'm just dying for a cigarette . I made this .

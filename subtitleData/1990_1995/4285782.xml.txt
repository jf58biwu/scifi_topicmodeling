 It 's that time of year , when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike . The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart . Every day I strive to make that dream come true . I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze . The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter . If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide . Bright shining clouds drift by . I see the TWP is winning . Yes , it appears to be so . How can you be so laid back about it ? If you had succeeded in your task this wouldn 't have happened . What is the matter with you ? The Lady Ninjas' surprise attack was a failure we sent a spy in but she got caught it 's just one disaster after another that 's what you want to say , right ? If you already know then why don 't you get off your ass and come up with another plan . I already have one . I have a plan to drag down the Pretty Four and their indispensable teamwork . And what would that be ? You 'll see . Nagoya , I 've entrusted you with this job because I have confidence in your abilities , especially after seeing your handiwork with our corporate takeovers . Don 't fail me again . I have a job to do . Don 't worry pops , I 'll smear that Harajuku for you . Miku Falls Head Over Heels . I 'm so bored ! Bored ! I can 't wait to get back in the ring ! Well , you look all better . Uh , I think you must have the wrong room . No , Miss Ginko , I 've come to see you . Me ? Hey there . Kinta . Who was that ? I have no idea . I think he got the wrong room . Ginko looks much better , we have no practice let 's just take it easy for a change . Yeah . Well ? I 'm starving ! Nana , you 're making a fool of yourself . Let 's treat ourselves to a really nice lunch today ! Yeah ! Food ! Food ! Oh yeah ? Let 's hear you say that again ! I said , you 're the ones who hit me ! No , you hit us . My shoulder is very sensitive . I think you need to pay us for damages . Blackmail ? That 's a lttle dated . What ? Why don 't we take this somewhere quieter ? Yay ! Miku . Yay ! Yeah ! Damn ! Hey , wait ! No , that 's enough . But ... No , really , it 's fine thanks to you ... Thank you . No , I just ... I don 't know how to repay you ... I 'd like to take you to lunch as a thank you . But ... Food ! Food ! Good , let 's go then . What about Sayaka and Nana ? I 'm gonna borrow her for a bit , okay ? That will be all . Enjoy your meal . A Pro Wrestler ... No wonder you 're so strong . Uh , I 'm usually very quiet , but back there , I ... You 're cute . I confess , from the first moment I saw you , I knew you were ... The star of beauty that I 'd been searching for . Is that a little forward of me ? I , uh ... I 've never been out to lunch with a man like this before . All I 've ever thought about was becoming strong . Look around you . Look at all the girls your age , out enjoying their youth . Why don 't you have some fun too ? It 's not natural to live only for Pro Wrestling . Not natural ? Yeah , you need to enjoy your youth more . Here we are . Umm ... I had a lot of fun today . Thank you very much . See you . Can I see you again ? Have some fun ... Stop thinking about wrestling for a bit . What 's the matter , Miku ? Oh , nothing . We saved dinner for you . I 'm fine . I 'm going to bed . Goodnight . Miku 's a little high from her first date . D-Date ? Yep , and he 's really nice and handsome . I wonder why he didn 't ask me out ? Miku went out with someone like that ? You can 't tell Coach about this . Love must be gently nurtured . Got it ? Look at all the girls your age , out enjoying their youth . It 's not natural to live only for Pro Wrestling . I 'm not unnatural , am I ? You idiot . What 's the matter with you ? I 'm sorry . Your jumps and your kicks are totally limp . How do you expect to beat anyone like that ? Do it again ! Yes ! To live only for Pro Wrestling ... This is pointless . What 's the matter ? You 're not your usual self . This isn 't dance practice . We 're starting over with the basics . Why us too ? Don 't talk back . 1,000 jump ropes . Now , 2,000 squats . Now , go run 30 kilometers . Sayaka , are we unnatural ? What do you mean ? Most girls don 't wrestle . Of course not . But ... Don 't talk to me , I 'm out of breath . Miku , you 're not yourself today . Ginko ! Welcome home . Hey ! Discharged and all better . Congratulations . Hey , quit slacking off . If you 're done running , sparing 's next . Yes , Coach . Coach , I want to train too . No , not you . But look , I 'm all better ! Miku , so I hear you had a date with a man . What 's he like ? C 'mon tell me . What , why so shy ? Sayaka , you guys know something , c 'mon , tell me . Sorry Ginko , today 's training was really hard , and we don 't have any strength left to talk . I 'm going to bed . I think I 'm gonna puke . I 'm done . Are you serious , Eiichiro ? Yes , we 'll use a formation without Ginko for the next match . But the doctor said she 's fine . All she has to do is build her strength back up . We have the semi-finals next ... We can 't win against these opponents with a half-assed plan . She doesn 't have time to get her strength back before the next match ! They 're all ... Damn . Oh , let me introduce myself . This is my card . United Battle Agency , Chief Manager ... Kazuma Nikaido . I 'm a women 's wrestling promoter in the US . We 're getting ready to start a new league in the States . We 'd like you to be one of the start up members when we debut . What , in America ? But I ... We know that you are the powerhouse of the Pretty Four ... But in the US , it 's common for skilled and popular athletes to go where the deal is sweeter . But why me ? I 've seen all of your fights . Even our Los Angeles office is impressed with your talent . We can offer you a better rank , and more money too . Wait a minute , I can 't just make a snap decision here . I have to talk to my teammates and my bosses . Think about it . You 're a star . Are you being treated like a star ? The way I see it , you 're not given the treatment you deserve . But I ... This is about your future . Yes , I see . At a later date , then . Fell right in to my trap ... The Universal Championship match between the Moonlight Jewels and the Amazons is about to begin . Miku and Ginko didn 't come after all . Miku doesn 't have much energy these days . Maybe it 's not going so well with that wonderful man . But I wonder why Ginko didn 't come . Put on your metal suits ! Here they are , the Death Gods of the Jungle , the Amazon Wrestlers . Moonlight Jewels ! Make sure you get lots of shots . Sapphire might show us some of her new moves today . Yes Sir ! Ruby ... We 're almost finished . Switch with me . Miku . I 'm going to send you to hell . What ? You want me to quit wrestling ? Yes , I don 't think it suits you . But ... You ought to have more romantic dreams . America ... I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile . Cheer up ! An angel without wings is just an ordinary person . Plain old hard work is more important than magic . In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest . Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats . Put your hands in your pockets . One day , they will come true the dreams that only you can dream . Not beaten down by the rain ... Not beaten down by Sapphire ... If a wrestler is in trouble in the East ... Go to the rescue ! If faced with the Star Wolves in the West kick their sorry butts ! Undisturbed by Shibano 's sabotage that 's the kind of wrestler I want to be ! Next time ... Miku Confesses . Miku 's Crash of Sorrow !

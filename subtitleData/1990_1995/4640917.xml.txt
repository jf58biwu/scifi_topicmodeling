 I found something beautiful . I don 't believe it ! Big , big , big surprise . Dr. Langford . Hello . What have we here ? Cover stones . It 's fantastic . Catherine , come . What in God 's name is that ? I wish I knew . Look at that . There is something buried underneath . Looks like some kind of fossil . Every other major architectural structure at the time was covered with detailed hieroglyphics . When is the academic community gonna accept the fact the Pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty did not build the Great Pyramids ? Look . Inside the pyramid , the most incredible structure ever erected , there are no writings whatsoever . Dr. Jackson . You 've left out the fact that Colonel Vyse - discovered quarrymen 's inscriptions ... - Right . Of Khufu 's name within the pyramid . His discovery was a fraud . Well , I hope you can prove it . Who do you think built the pyramids ? I don 't have any idea who built them . Men from Atlantis ? Or Martians perhaps ? The point is not who built them . The point is when they were built . I mean , we all know new geological evidence dates the Sphinx back to a much earlier period . And knowing this , I think we have to begin to reevaluate everything we 've come to accept about ... I 've been able to show a fully developed writing system appeared in the first two dynasties . Which is almost as if it was based on an even earlier prototype . Is there a lunch or something that everybody ... - Dr. Jackson . - What ? Yes ? Someone wants to speak with you . Air Force ? What 's this ? What is this ? Will you step over to the car , please ? Sir ? - Are we going somewhere ? - You 're gonna be fine . We 'll take care of these . Jackson , are those your parents ? Foster parents . - What is this all about ? - A job . - What kind of a job ? - Translation . Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs . Interested ? I 'm gonna go now . Go where ? You 've just been evicted from your apartment . Your grants have run out . Everything you own are in those two bags . Want to prove that your theories are right ? This is your chance . - What 's this ? - Travel plans . Sir ? Mrs. O 'Neil ? Come on in . Mrs. O 'Neil , is your husband at home ? Yes . Do you think we might be able to speak with him ? You can try . Excuse me , Colonel O 'Neil . We 're from General West 's office . Sir ? We 're here to inform you that you 've been reactivated . The guy 's a mess . How 'd he get like that ? His kid died . Accidentally shot himself . Jesus ! Cleared . Cold ? Allergies . Always happens when I travel . There you go . - Dr. Jackson ? - Hello . - Dr. Gary Meyers . How are you ? - What is this place ? Nuclear missile silo . Don 't worry , it 's been converted . Barbara Shore . - Hello . - Hi . - OK , Jackson . Welcome to the well . - Hello . This is ... Where 'd you find this ? Giza Plateau , 1928 . I 've never seen anything like this . Of course you haven 't . No one has . There 's two lines of hieroglyphs . The inner track has the classic figures , but the outer track is like the cartouche in the center . It 's got writing unlike we 've ever found before . Those aren 't hieroglyphics . They might be a form of hieratic , or maybe cuneiform . Well , the translation of the inner track is wrong . They must have used Budge . I don 't know why they keep reprinting his books . Excuse me ? What are you doing ? - We 've used every known technique . - Curious word to use , qebeh . - Yeah . - Then an adverbial sejemenef . " Sealed ... buried . " Excuse me . What are you doing ? It 's not " coffin . " " For all time . " Who the hell translated this ? I did . Well , this should read , " A million years into the sky is Ra , Sun God ... " sealed and buried for all time ... " it 's not " door to heaven . " " His ... " stargate . " So , why is the military so interested in 5,000-year-old Egyptian tablets ? My report says 10,000 . Good afternoon , Colonel . Do I know you ? I 'm Colonel Jack O 'Neil from General West 's office . I 'll be taking over from now on . The figure 10,000 is ludicrous . Egyptian culture didn 't exist ... We know , but the sonic and radiocarbon tests are conclusive . These are cover stones . Was there a tomb underneath ? No . But we found something a lot more interesting . Excuse me . This information has become classified . From now on , no information is to be passed on to nonmilitary personnel without my express permission . Catherine , what 's going on here ? I 'm not sure . Colonel O 'Neil , I think you owe me an explanation . I was told I had complete autonomy . Plans change . Why are you here ? Why did they bring you on this project ? I 'm here in case you succeed . Completed search on cuneiform and other predynastic hieroglyphics . No matches whatsoever . I 've exhausted all reference material comparing the cartouche 's symbols against all known writing samples from the period pre and post . Still no similarities . I 'm never gonna get paid . Can I borrow this ? Orion . - Right here . - I 'd like you to meet General West . Oh , hello . Oh , right , General . So you think you 've solved in 14 days what they couldn 't solve in two years ? Two years ? Anytime . I have some stuff to look at . Just pass them down . You 'll have to share them . I 'm sorry . I don 't have enough . We 're obviously looking at the picture of the cover stones . Now , on the outer track , these figures that you had believed to be words to be translated were , in fact ... sorry about that . Were , in fact , star constellations . Now , these constellations were placed in a unique order forming a map . Seven points to outline a course to a position and ... to find a destination within any three-dimensional space , you need six points to determine the exact location . You said you needed seven points . No , six for the destination . But to chart a course , you need ... a point of origin . Except there 's only six symbols in the cartouche . Well , the seventh actually isn 't inside the cartouche . It 's just below it here , designated by a little pyramid ... with two ... funny ... neat little guys and ... funny little line coming out of the top . Anyway ... - He did it . - No ! That symbol isn 't anywhere on the device . What device ? Show him . What is that ? That 's your Stargate . Come , Jackson . Technical personnel , report to command center . - Monitors up . - Monitors are up . Mitch , bring up the details on the center monitor . I 've got details on . Hold it . Wait . Do you have a ... Oh . Here . Sorry . Hey . Don 't ... Two figures on either side ... Praying beside a pyramid , with a sun directly above it . He 's right . It was in front of us the whole time . General West . Jackson has identified the seventh symbol . Go ahead . Programming seventh symbol into computer . Chevron one is holding . Chevron one is locked in place . Power output at 23 % . Chevron two is holding . - Engaged . - Chevron two is locked in place . We 're at 35 % . We got a Condition Red at the gate . Evacuate all personnel . This was under the cover stones ? Yes . My father found it , 1928 . Made out of a mineral unlike any found on Earth . Chevron five , locked in place . 79 % . Chevron six is holding . Chevron six is locked in place . This is as far as we have ever been able to get . Chevron seven ! Chevron seven is locked in place . Send in the probe . Yes , Sir . Record all information from the Stargate . - Clear inner silo for approach . - Clear inner silo . It 's guiding itself . Can you believe that ? Beam has locked itself onto a point somewhere in the Kaliam galaxy . It has mass . It could be a moon or a large asteroid . Where are we on that map ? The blue dot . That 's right , Jackson . It 's on the other side of the known universe . We 're losing the signal . This is the information the probe sent back to us . Freeze and enhance . You can clearly see the gate on the other side . Both gates must 've functioned as a doorway between our worlds . These readings tell us it 's an atmospheric match . Barometric pressure , temperature , and , most importantly , oxygen . These markings are different . They don 't match the symbols on our gate . That 's why we may have to abort . This project is for naught without a reconnaissance mission . Once on the other side , we would have to decipher the markings on their gate and in essence , dial home in order to bring the team back . Based on this new information , I don 't see how we can do that . Well , I could do that . Are you sure ? Positive . He 's full of shit . You 're on the team . You understand this complicates things ? That 's why I wanted you , Jack . We 've opened a doorway to a world we know nothing about . Jackson . Hello . Hi . - I have something for you . - No , I ... Yes . I found it with Stargate when I was a child . It has brought me luck . You can bring it back to me . Backup storage . Reserve power on . If anybody has anything to say , now 's the time to say it . Vector tracking set . Jackson ! it 's all right . It 's over . Stay with him . Jackson , just listen to me . Keep moving . It wears off in a minute . What a rush ! Prepare to move out . - Three teams , let 's go . - White team , go . Team two , move up . Clear . No contact . - O2 ratio stable . - Conditions are similar to inside . I wanna take a look around . - Kawalsky . Feretti . - Let 's rock 'n'roll . Move up there . Good . I knew it . .332 . Report . Our quarter-mile perimeter survey is just about complete , sir . Wrap this up . Get everybody back inside . I want all you people back through the Stargate within the hour . You 're coming with us , aren 't you , Colonel ? - Sir ? - Jackson . Start working on the Stargate . - What 's that all about ? - I don 't know , Feretti . I 'm gonna need more time . There 's bound to be more structures here or some other traces of civilization . Not this trip . Just get back in there and reestablish contact . It 's not that easy . This is a replica of the great Pyramid of Giza . We 're not gonna find any hieroglyphic inscriptions or carved relief . We really need to look around more . Your job here is to realign the Stargate . Can you do that or not ? I can 't . You can 't or you won 't ? I can decipher the symbols on the Stargate , but I need an order of alignment . The order was on tablets on Earth and there must be something like that here . I just need to find it . Find it ? What do you mean , find it ? You didn 't say you had to find anything . - I assumed the tablets would be here . - You assumed ? You 're a lying son of a bitch ! You didn 't say a word about finding anything ! Set up a camp down here . Organize our supplies . - Sir ... - You 've got your orders . - I can 't believe we 're stuck here . - Don 't be such a doomsayer . - Give it a rest . - Yes , please . If we 're not back soon , they 'll just turn on the gate from the other side . It doesn 't work that way . You see , if you don 't turn it on from here , we 're screwed . OK ? So I 'm telling you guys , we 're not going anywhere . Shut up . It 's a nice tent . Oh , we each get a tent . That 's nice . What the hell is that ? Thermal blanket . I don 't need that . Talk to him . - I got everything here but Sunblock . - Hey . Isn 't there something you should be doing now , like getting us outta here ? Foot powder . Great . That 's cold . Base camp is up , sir . Where 's Jackson ? It 's OK . It 's OK . That 's a good boy . Good boy . What ? What do you want ? You want some of this ? Here you go . You like that ? There you go . There you go . I wouldn 't feed that thing ! It 's got a harness ! It 's domesticated ! Dammit ! Let go of it ! Help me ! Help me ! You OK , Jackson ? Go away . Easy . All right , Jackson . You 're on . Me ? You 're the linguist . Try to talk to them . - What the hell did you say to him ? - Nothing . It 's OK . It 's OK . See ? Quartz primary element . I can 't make it out . It sounds familiar , a bit like Berber . Maybe it 's Chadic or Amharic . Thank you . Here . - What 's that mean ? - I have no idea . - He 's inviting us to go with him . - How can you be so sure ? Because he 's inviting us to go with him . We were looking for signs of civilization . Obviously we 've found it . You want me to get us home , this is our best shot . Colonel , he 's right . I took some readings on what they 're mining back there . It 's the same material as the Stargate . Radio base camp . Tell them to keep that area secured until we get back . Yes , Sir . - Base camp , come in . - Feretti , I 've got ' em . Come on . Yes , sir ? Can you repeat that , sir ? Colonel O 'Neil requested that you secure base camp . We 'll be here for a while . OK , sir . - You understand ? - Yes , sir . - So , what 's the story ? - They 're not coming back . OK ? This is not good . The eye of Ra . It 's the Egyptian sun god . They think he sent us here . Yeah . I wonder what could 've given them that idea . Where are they all going ? Come in . Come in . Feretti , I can 't hear you . Sir , I can 't make this out . Feretti , say again . We have to abandon base camp ! Repeat ! We have to abandon base camp ! - It 's useless ! It won 't work in this ! - Let 's go ! Everybody , back inside ! Come on , take what you can carry ! Get the battery pack ! Grab it ! We 're going back right now . Let 's go . Wait . Wait . Get over here . Stay here . What is it , Colonel ? Sandstorm coming this way . That would 've been an excellent reason to shoot everyone . We 'll stay until it 's over . The pyramid ! Back into the pyramid ! Where the hell did that come from ? Kawalsky , Brown , do you read ? Hey , Jackson . I don 't think we should eat any food here . They might consider that an insult . We don 't want to offend them , now , do we , Daniel ? Tastes like chicken . Tastes like chicken . it 's good . Tastes like chicken . Good . - You said that was an Egyptian symbol . - Yeah . The eye of Ra . Would you say it might stand to reason , if they know one Egyptian symbol ... Yes . What the hell 's going on ? It seems like writing is forbidden to them . What ? What ? They want me to go with them . Should I stay ? I 'll go with them . I 'll go . I 'll be fine . OK , that 's good . All right . That 's good . What is that smell ? OK , that 's good . My hands are pretty clean . Thank you very very much . Thank you . That was very nice . Thank you . That was great . I smell much better now than ... Yes , thank you . Christ . I smell like a yak . No , please , no more . Please . Please . No more . I 'm fine . I 'm clean . I 'm ... I thought you were one of the other cleaning ... You don 't have to do that . Please . Maybe you should go . OK ? It 's OK . Maybe you should go . It 's OK . It 's all right . Here . Let me grab this . No , it 's me . I wanted to thank you . I 'm very happy . Thank you . Daniel . - Daniel . - No . I 'm ... Daniel . I 'm Daniel . Sha 'uri . We came ... Pyramid . We came from the pyramid . It 's OK . Never mind . It 's OK . Earth . You know the symbol ? You know this symbol ? You 've seen this symbol ? Show me . You show me . Kawalsky , this is base . Do you copy ? You 're wasting the battery . You 'll never get anything in this storm . Wait until it passes . Yeah , right . If it passes . I was stationed in the Middle East . I 've never seen anything like it . Yeah , yeah . I don 't understand . Why don 't we just turn the gate back on ourselves ? - Yeah . How hard can it be ? - That would be great . We could turn it in the wrong order and materialize the vacuum of outer space . Do you have any idea how many possible combinations there are on that thing ? No . How many ? Shut up . What the hell is goin ' on ? All right , spread out . Let 's move . It 's OK . it 's just a lighter . Watch . See ? Here . Try it . Yeah , it 's pretty fabulous . Ah , you 're right . It 's pretty stupid . No , you keep it . It 's yours . It 's dangerous ! What is this place ? Here . I 'll be damned . What ? No signal at all ? Nothing . More interference ? No . They 're simply not there . - Any sign of him ? - I haven 't been able to locate Jackson . We 're looking for Jackson . Jackson . Guy who wears this jacket . He 's got long hair that comes down ... No . Wears glasses so he can see . I guess the word " dweeb " doesn 't mean anything to you guys , does it ? Yeah . Why not ? I 'm on Planet X looking for a dweeb who wears green fatigues . He wears this jacket . He 's got long hair . It comes over his eyes . He wears glasses and ... sneezes . Chicken . Chicken man ! You got it . YOU want this ? Thought you couldn 't speak their language . You scared me . It 's an ancient Egyptian dialect . Like the rest of their culture , it 's evolved completely independently , but once you know the vowels ... Just answer the question . I just had to learn how to pronounce it . It hasn 't been a living , spoken language in more than one thousand years . Look at this . It says : " A traveler from distant stars escaped from a dying world , " looking for a way to extend his own life . " His body decaying and weak , he couldn 't prevent his own demise . " Apparently his whole species was becoming extinct . " So he traveled or ... " searched the galaxies looking for a way to cheat death . " Look here . " He came to a world rich with life " where he encountered a primitive race . " Humans . " A species which , with all his powers and knowledge , " he could maintain indefinitely . " He realized within a human body he had a chance for a new life . " Now , he apparently found a young boy . It says , " As the frightened villagers ran , night became day . " Curious and without fear , he walked towards the light . " Ra took him and possessed his body like some kind of parasite looking for a host . Then , inhabiting this human form , he appointed himself ruler . He used the Stargate to bring thousands of people to this planet as workers for the mines . Just like the one we saw . This mineral is clearly the building block of all his technology . With this , he can sustain eternal life . Something happened back on Earth , a rebellion or uprising , and the Stargate was buried there . Fearful of a rebellion here , Ra outlawed reading and writing . He didn 't want people to remember the truth . Jackson , I think you 'd better take a look at this . That 's it . That 's what we 're looking for . They must have hidden it here hoping the gate on Earth could be reopened . I knew they 'd have it written down someplace . Wait a minute . Where 's the seventh symbol ? It must 've broken . It 's gotta be here somewhere . It 's worn off . I can 't make it work without the seventh symbol . All right , that 's it . Kawalsky . Brown . Come on , Jackson ! What the hell is that ? Here . You might need this . Look out ! Where are we going ? Why are we going to the Stargate ? I can 't make it work . Shoot anything that comes down that ramp . - What are you doing ? - Just cover me . What is that ? - What are you looking for ? - it 's gone . Put it down , Jackson . You have come here to destroy me . What is that ? It 's a bomb , isn 't it ? That 's what you were looking for . What the hell were you thinking ? What did you come here for ? Wait ! No ! Colonel ! it 's me . You all right ? Where 's Jackson ? Sha 'uri , what happened here ? Ra punished us . Why ? What happened to Daniel ? Son , we should not have helped the strangers . I was dead ? That is why I chose your race , your bodies , so easy to repair . You have advanced much , harnessed the power of the atom . What are you going to do ? You should not have reopened the gate . Soon , I will send your weapon back to your world with a shipment of our mineral , which will increase your weapon 's destructive power a hundredfoldl Why would you do that ? I created your civilization . Now I will destroy it ! But before my workers question my authority , you will prove that I am their one God by killing your companions . If I refuse ? Then I will destroy you and all who have seen you . There can only be one Ra ! Sha 'uri , Ra has called an assembly . An execution . Skaara ... Nabeh ... I want you to listen . We can 't let this happen . I want you to know what Daniel told me about where our people came from and why we can no longer live as slaves . Freeman ! Over there ! Come on ! Kawalskyl To our victory ! We recovered your weapons . Here , Colonel . So , what do you think ? They 're not exactly Special Forces , but they sure were eager to join up . Take these guns away , Lieutenant , before they hurt themselves . - Sir ? - You heard me . Send them all home . There 's no place for these kids to go . - Anyway , we could use their help . - For what ? To do what ? Why don 't you just tell them everything ? Why don 't you tell them about the bomb ? What 's he talking about ? My orders were simple . Track down signs of any possible danger , and if I found any , blow up the Stargate . Well , I found some . Your bomb is his now . And tomorrow he 's gonna send it back to Earth , along with that mineral they mine here . When that thing goes off , it 'll cause an explosion a hundred times more destructive than that bomb alone was capable of . I 'll intercept that bomb before he can send it through . - Why wasn 't I told of this ? - There was no reason to tell you . You weren 't even supposed to be here . You were all gonna go back with Daniel . I was gonna stay behind and blow up the Stargate , and that 's what I 'm gonna do . The gate on Earth is the threat . That 's the one we have to shut down . You 're absolutely right . But since you don 't know how to get us back , we don 't have that option , do we ? Where are they ? Answer ! We looked everywhere . Some kids are helping them . You accepted the fact that , no matter what , you would not be going home ? Don 't you have people who care about you ? Do you have a family ? I had a family . No one should ever have to outlive their own child . I don 't want to die . Your men don 't want to die . And these people here don 't want to die . It 's a shame you 're in such a hurry to . How could you let them escape ? I will not accept failure ! Why are you laughing ? Husbands don 't do this work . Husband ? Married ? Don 't be angry , I didn 't tell them . Tell them what ? That you did not want me . What are you drawing ? The day of our victory . Connect the moons . This is the symbol for this planet . That 's it . The point of origin . What are you doing ? I found it . - What are you talking about ? - The seventh symbol . We 're going home . Let 's go . You 'll bring disaster to all of us , son . Father , we will not live as slaves . Take a look at your gods . Take a good look . The caravan is approaching . Send the bomb down to the Stargate . What 's happening up there ? How you doin ' ? Damn ! Come on , Feretti ! Come on ! You OK ? You all right ? Spread out ! Let 's go ! - We 're dead ! - Quit talking like that . - What are we gonna do ? - Cover me . Cover you ? Kawalskyl Help me push this thing over ! Send the bomb to Earth now ! I will send it myself ! - What are you doing ? - Completing this mission . We agreed to dismantle the gate on Earth . And you will . That 's your job now . I 'm gonna stay here and make sure this goes off . You got seven minutes . What are you doing ? Jackson . Wait for me . - You got any rounds at all , Feretti ? - We 're all out of ammo ! Incoming ! Kawalsky , we gotta do something . Stop ! Hey ! I am no longer amused . You will die together . Give my regards to King Tut , asshole . - How much time do we have left ? - 45 seconds . - He 's leaving . Turn it off . - I 'm trying to . I can 't disarm it . What ? I can 't stop it . They got it rigged . I 've got an idea . - I always knew you 'd get us back . - Yeah , right . Later . Thanks , Daniel . - You sure you want to do this ? - Yes , I 'm sure . You gonna be all right ? I 'm gonna be all right . How about you ? Yeah . Yeah , I think so . Tell Catherine this brought me luck . I will . I 'll be seeing you around ... Dr. Jackson .

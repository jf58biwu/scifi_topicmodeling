 THE THIRD PLANET - Everything 's fine . - Did the doctor say so ? The doctor , too , everything 's fine . - Hi ! - Hello . Well ? - What did the doctors say ? - I didn 't expect anything else . Sure , there was some damn hope ... Listen , you said you knew a man who could lead into the Zone . Is it that bad ? Yep . It 's impossible to look at your faces without crying . Stop bothering me . I 'll mix up my calculus . Don 't mix them up with us . Normal people have normal faces . They seek ordinary things . We naturally have the faces of donkeys . We seek what 's bigger and cheaper . Everything is clear here . But , uncle Misha ... Simple and very tasty . Mankind has reached a special perfection here . - Killing themselves . - Yes . And enjoying it . Pick up some things . I 'll be back soon . Some woman from our god-forsaken place came here and went out of her mind . Well , I understand her . If I understood anything about this ... - Where were you ? - Don 't be cross . Misha , I 've already tried everything . So will you help me ? Those are just tales for unfortunates . Mutants with their organs suitable for everyone , their superpowers ... - Do you know this ? - But do you ? Have you seen them or just heard about them ? I 've just heard about them . That 's why I consider the Zone to be a myth . I can 't lose her . Understand , I 'm a healthy man ... and I can do absolutely nothing for my daughter . Our land has accomplished the greatest feat , that of survival . No nation in the world ... has remained unblemished for seventy three years . There are problems . Many depart now out of tiredness or disenchantment . And the Zone - that 's a convenient tale . Okay , I 'll shut up . To hell with you . OK , I 'll write a letter . If God allows , Ivan will bring you over to the Zone . When ? OK , Right away . I 'll put everything aside and write it . Look at yourself and think about where you 're going ! If you were alone ... alright , I 'll shut up . Can we go faster ? We can . Why are we being dragged towards the motherland so much . When we arrive we 'll be in a trance for a week . They way we 're living , it 's shameful . What we 've brought our country to . Uncle Misha , do you long for the motherland ? Oh , my friend ... There 's an old Hebrew fable about a man who wanted to see how people in other lands live . His wife prepared him for the journey , he bid farewell to all his family . And he went out of the city for the first time in his life . He walked all day . And in the evening , tired , laid down to rest . There are fields all round him , no trees , no bushes . He turns over in his sleep , wakes up the next morning and mistakenly , returns the way he came . In the evening he reaches a city very much like his own . He finds a street identical to the one where he has spent his whole life . And there is a house on this street , just like his house . Then he saw a woman whose face reminded him of his wife . And children , too , very much like his children . The woman smiled . He stayed to live with her , earned his bread and supported the woman and children . Anyway , he lived happily , not bad . But he longed for his motherland , for his whole life . And all this time thinks of his kids he has left behind . Man , living in Russia , should be sent to Paradise , no questions asked . Don 't pity me , I 'm gonna cry . I , too , begin longing for a motherland . That place ... - Where ? - The place where he stayed . - It 's just a story . - He didn 't know geography . When others went to school he had to work to feed his family . You don 't understand a thing . Fools ! It 's just a fable ! We 've arrived . Motherland . Yes ... We 're home . Yes , we 've reached the motherland . Home . It depends how you say it . Home ... It can sound horrible . Thanks . - The road to Znamenci ? - What ? - Does this road lead to Znamenci ? - Yes , this one . - Need a lift ? - No . Are you from the city ? - Yes . - Do you know section five ? - No . - You don 't know section five ? - Right beside the railway station ... - Thanks . Now we 'll know . You 're from the city but don 't know section five ... Checkpoint sergeant Anfiev . Your pass and documents , please . - Here you are . - Purpose of arrival ? Everything 's written there : visiting relatives . Are those sleeping bags ? What for ? Isn 't it allowed ? We don 't know where we 'll be able to sleep . To stop or turn off the road is forbidden . Yes , I know that . Good bye . Turn right after four kilometres . A radioactive hazard sign . Here it is . The sign . So , five hundred metres from here is a left turn . Then three kilometres further . - Are we being trailed ? - Maybe not . Wife ? She 's his daughter . You go to bathhouse first . We 'll follow . How 's Mikhail ? Well , what about him ? Does he intend to pay us a visit ? - Beautiful . - After father . He said he 'd drive by in spring . Put down the canister . Do your clients give you the cars ? They leave them . I need a car . You can 't get through with a car . Times are not right . I won 't make it in time without a car . We only have three days . Do as you like . You won 't get through in a car . If you do take one into the Zone ... there are clean , little cars these days . If you want , you can find them . I 'll sketch a map . - How old are you ? - Fifteen . - Your father is okay . - There are many like that , these days . - Like what ? - Doberman pinchers . - What do you mean ? - Ah , nonsense . First passage is here , near the cliffs . You can get a car at the motorboat base . I 'll tell you where to get gasoline . You can get a car there as well as gas . I 'll expect you in three days . Here , by the pier . Where 's Ivan ? Keep quiet . What 's your name ? Understand , there 's a strong undertow . The motor is weak . Then go this way , it will be less walking for me . We 'll meet there . That suits me fine . Cheers . Let 's do it . I 've seen this bottle before . I remember now . I took one exactly like this . I picked up one in the port , a little one , she was called ... Hoa , that means " river " in our tongue . Woke up in the morning ... No bottle , no Hoa . Ivan ! Stop ! Ivan , stop ! Turn around ! Ivan , come back ! Damn you ... Ivan ! Now I get it ... Why you 've come . It 's hereditary ? - What ? - This illness . Don 't worry , it 's not hereditary . See , I thought I could let you go . Yeah , I thought it . - I wish you luck ! - I 'll wait for you ... In three days on the railroad near the pier . Dear God ! Damn ! Hello . It 's you who have gasoline ? I ... can ... offer ... this as a price . No ? Then , perhaps ... This ? Here you go . More ? Here . Take it . Is that enough ? Take this . Thank you . Here 's the sign . That means the river is three hundred metres ahead . We 've arrived . - Well then ? - Let 's go . Where did this city really go ? Disappear to ? It sank . It was drowned for all its sins . Worms dug at it from beneath . And only the water reads these writings now , washing it all away . Devils . We 're looking for Shurich . Her relatives lived here . So , do you know Shurich ? Excuse me , we must find Shurich . If you know her relatives . Help us to find her . Shurich . Do you know ? Hell ! We 're in a hurry . Excuse me , we 're in a great hurry ! If you know where she is , take us to her So will you take us or not ? Get out quick . Get out . - Wait ! What 's your name ? - Mine ? Gleb . - Anton . Alyona . - Let 's go . What d 'you mean ? D 'you know where we must go ? No . It 's simply too dangerous here . We need Shurich . We 're looking for her . She lives around here . - Shurich . You go to meet her ? - Yes . Yes . We really need her . She 's a healer . Her special charms . Here 's her photo . - But this isn 't Shurich . - How come , not Shurich ? Here 's another photo of her . Look . It was taken three years ago , though . Here 's her house . Here 's the photo . No . She doesn 't live there . - Do people live here ? - They do . Kosoy lived here . Then Shurich , mother of Snezhana . Snezhana at first lived ... Abraham begot Isaac , Isaac begot Jacob ... Evangelist ! You are simply being asked who lives here now ... and who lived here three years ago . Snezhka . Is that her ? - That is Shurich , Yelena Mikhaylovna . - Do you know her ? No ? You didn 't mention her name , yet he even knew her patronym . It 's written in the book . By the way , this guy knows Swedish . Listen ! Can you lead us to this Snezhana or Shurich ? Here ! Let 's get moving . I hope everything is fine with her head ... Gleb ! Has Snezhana got all her senses ? Is she alright in the head ? Her head ? Everything 's fine . Faster ! - Gleb , what 's this ? - You mustn 't stop here . Gleb , d 'you sense radiation ? - Radiation ? I sense it . I can see it . - Sure . He sees it and I sense it . If you fill me with pastry , you could bake a cake . Shut up and get a move on . Faster ? How can one go faster ? The one who flees , falls down . The one who crawls , won 't fall . Interesting ... - Gleb ! - Yes ? - Is it possible to eat these crayfish ? - It 's possible . You can be eaten . We can be eaten , too . - Interesting : do they like to eat us ? - No . They simply purge their world . Purge world ... Their world . Purge from us . Good morning . - It 's broken ? - God forbid . Where 's Gleb ? - I don 't know . - He 's run away . He broke the counter and ran after mutants . The mutants will catch us . And throw us to the crayfish . The crayfish will grow fat . The mutants will eat them with cold beer . Why are you standing ? You 're very nosy ? Get out of here ! - Thanks . I don 't eat it raw . - Me too . You 're healthy ad absurdum . - Natural man . Candide . - What ? - Don 't you have ... nudists ? - Haven 't heard of them . I thought not . Throw me your stick ! Go on ! Hit ! Hold yourself ! - Are these bilberries edible ? - They are . Who would 've thought . Fresh bilberries , winter , abroad ... Wait for me here . Is this the exact right place ? Yes . Only the woman you 're looking for doesn 't live here . Hello . Hello . Are you Snezhana ? - Here . - I don 't know her . - But this is this house ? - Yes , that 's my house . - And Shurich ? - I don 't know her . Has this man been here ? No . And this one hasn 't ? No . To hell with it ! Sons of bitches ! Damn writers ! They 've made everything up ! The Zone . An old woman and her house . Slaves of the machines ! Already ... You perhaps ... - You can heal , Right ? - Some small things , but serious ... Who told you that it was serious ? You guessed yourself ? Therefore , you can . I knew it . Otherwise ... I 'd lose hope . - Wait . You didn 't understand anything . - I understood everything . Look at her . Look . - If you want , I 'll pay you . - We will look at her . - Why should they look at me ? - It has to be so , Alyona . That 's like showing me to a plumber in a hospital . Would you do that ? What are they ? Can you heal ? You see ? They don 't know how to heal . They can charm away warts , put plantain on wounds . But when you 're ill .. they sit in steam houses and drink tea with raspberries . Alright . Forgive me . OK . I would have stepped in earlier , but was curious how you would pay them . Why is it always like this with us ? When you 're twenty you 're a prophet , when you 're forty you begin to think ... Why are you sitting there ? Is Khromoy a master ? - Master , as well . - Does he know how to heal ? Sure , he knows . He knows so much he doesn 't write books anymore . I don 't understand . Why doesn 't he write ? Books are said words , but words are said by those who know . But those who know don 't keep words in books . Nonsense . So , Khromoy is the smartest of you ? And he lives in the city ? For some reason all of you live in the city . They live there because it 's possible to know the world without leaving your home - What 's there ? - Throw a stone there , please . - What for ? - Throw it , please . Stop ! I 'm I talking to you , Stop ! - Funny boy you have . - He 's not mine , he 's Gleb 's . - I thought he was yours . I 'll have one , I 'm still young . - How old are you ? - I 'll be twenty in the summer . In summer . That 's interesting . What have you got now ? Summer means bananas grow on fir trees and pineapples ripen in moss . Who owns this ? Gleb does . What is he to you ? Husband ? Lover ? Friend ? He 's Gleb to me . Understand ? What are you doing here ? Escaping from the world , aren 't you ? Why are you so angry ? - I 'm sick of your rural idyll . - Then why did you come here ? Why ? Do you want to know ? I don 't believe in you . Your powers are meant for people like my father . I think you just do it for the money . You 're tired . I might say many stupid things but I want to say what I think of you . You 've spouted that shit for so long that you 've started to believe it . I say this to you so you won 't have any illusions about me . I don 't . By the way , do your hens lay cubic eggs ? - Why would we need them ? - I haven 't seen any . Don 't be afraid , I only wanted to talk to you . Listen , we can 't actually help you . We 're people like anyone else . And what 's written in your book is make-believe . - I don 't know how to ask you ... - I can 't help you . Can 't or don 't want to ? You 're a mother . Please help me . I 'll accept anything . Don 't be foolish . You said " foolish " ? Is the life of my child foolish ? I 'll do something foolish , only you 'll do something even more so . I will kill your son . Do you hear me ? I will kill him ! It 's not sunstroke . You 're already forty . You must watch your health at your age . But you still run around like a kid . You knocked back two glasses yesterday and thought it wouldn 't affect you . That it wouldn 't do any harm ... it 's frightening to look at you . Don 't try to be like Uncle Misha who at least plays sport . Always your uncle Misha . You are more and more like your mother . We separated when our conversations got more quantitative than qualitative . Like the quarrels you hear in trams . Well , attaboy . Otherwise you 'd get totally grumpy . Well ? Interesting ? One more time ... for me . Good boy . Talent . Look , can you do this ? Can you do it ? Go on , turn it over so it doesn 't drop . Oh , you ... Flora is older than the animal kingdom , and both much older than man . We 've aspired to extend our lifespan whilst treating the world so poorly using up so many resources and trying to adapt to nature without really understanding and knowing it . - I 'd say without trying to understand it . - Yes . And that 's what has happened here , I mean , your world , Gleb , that 's very characteristic . Our definition of intellect is limited . Man is always the point of reference . - Why man ? - Well , man is the crown of nature . No ... Why ? What particularly singles out man ? Goodness , love , religion . All of them are human qualities . This is our system of evaluation . Perhaps everything is different for them - For what ? - For trees , grass ... We humanize nature . We judge it according to our concepts without thinking that perhaps we are something ephemeral , unnecessary to this world . I propose a new name . Homo finitus . Even smarter . Homo finalis . Anyway , you made me lose my train of thought ... Don 't fuss like a little kid . You read it somewhere and then convinced yourself that you invented it . - Where could I read this ? - I don 't know . " Young Naturalist " , " Pioneer Truth " . Whatever you subscribe for me . - Well , what will the square root be ? - 888,5 . Correct . - And if you multiply ? - Zero . - How do you do this ? - I 'm not doing it . - What then ? - Simple . I simply want it . Where does the doctor live ? Why do I want a doctor ? What if you fall ill ? Someone must treat you . Why should I fall ill if it 's not necessary ? Hold this . Why ? That 's a stupid question . People fall ill for all sorts of reasons Is that clear ? - Where does Khromoy live ? - There , in the city . In the city ... Here ! Here ! Come here ! Here they are . Oh ... so they eat this filth . How much Roentgen is there ? They 've been cleaning up here since last year . You do as you wish , but I can 't . What 's wrong ? It 's natural . I need a doctor ... I need a doctor . You can remain sitting . I understand it 's hard for you ... Signal from sector five , as suspected . We have two casualties , one of which is hopeless . Trap 4 was triggered . Weapons remain on site . Again ... Where 's Gleb ? Shooting ? There ? Keep silent . You don 't understand anything , Here . You brought them here . Nonsense . What 's that ? A transmitter . Measuring radiation you turned on the transmitter . So they came . Snezhana , have you seen my book ? It 's impossible . I brought it over the counter in an ordinary shop , I was one of thousands of customers . It could have been planted outside the shop . Oh , here it is . What ? Do you think we were sent here ? I don 't know . What do you mean - you don 't know ? So you suspected us from the very beginning ? I came here for the sake of my daughter . I don 't understand a thing ! This is just stupid ! She doesn 't care about that . This has happened and we are to blame . No ! This is very important ! I don 't want us to be considered enemies here . Better pack your things . They 'll soon be here . Where did the toys go ? Just a moment , Snezhka . Well ... but you 're clear . Dogs ? They don 't have any dogs . They 'll get us even without dogs . We 've left such a trail only fool wouldn 't see it . Let 's go . They 're near . Wait . Wait ! This is madness . We 're getting lost in here . It 's useless . Listen , people are expecting us , to fetch us out of the Zone . That 's our only chance to save ourselves . Do you understand ? Wait . If you don 't care about yourself , at least think about the boy . Alright . Turn back . It 's too hot for you here . Hot ? I feel it even without the counter . My skin is burning . You walk all over the Zone . A nuclear tan suits you . They don 't need us . But why are they hunting you ? - Is that what they want ? - Is it your organs they 're after ? - Is that what it is ? - Don 't talk such nonsense . As you wish ... Snezhana , wait . Take it , it will come handy . Where is he ? I don 't understand what use it was . To you ? To me ? I don 't need this . Why did you drag me there ? Do you understand I don 't need anything anymore ? That 's it . It 's all over . We 're already there . There . It doesn 't matter how we 've got here ... What 's the difference ? One moment ... The trace is hot . Easy to see . They passed through the dirtiest places . They won 't last long . Are they headed for the sea ? Yes , most likely . Keep in contact . Let them get close the shore if they have a boat . Wait . - Well ? - It 's ok . - Unusually clean . - She 's not from the Zone . Also clean . And how about here ? Alyona ? Where are the mutants ? Where are they ? So you can do it . Damn it ! You can . I knew it . I can 't do anything . I simply ease the pain , that 's all . I can 't cure . I don 't know anything . No , you can do it , after all . You can , but you don 't want to ! Understand , I just eased the pain , that 's all . They must have a boat . Get up ! Show us where the boat is and you 'll live . Let 's go . Animals ! Dear God . What brutes ! Bastards ! - Where 's the boat ? - The boat is there . Hold it . Keep watch on him . You ... Gleb ... right ? Don 't , Alyona , don 't . Burn the sack . Go to the shore ! The car is here . Snezhka , don 't drag me . I 'm tangled up . We 're here . Can 't see a damn thing . - What are you called ? - Anton . No , what did your mom call you ? Toshka . Then , I 'll call you ... Aren 't you afraid to bring us into the world ? What are we ? Perhaps we 're bringing evil . Vengeance for violating our home . You could be bringing unhappiness with us . Illness and suffering . It wasn 't for nothing the world separated from us . She was told : Don 't do harm to grass , or trees or any green plant . Just harm people . Who doesn 't know how to . I 'm not afraid . Is it time ? I want to eat . - Well ? - Clean . What 's there ? Iviy ! Some kind of rug . Have you seen the doctor anywhere ? Number One , Seven calling ! - attempting to leave the Zone ... - Where 's the doctor ? License plate ... Klimenkov , look , what 's the license plate . Wait . No , I don 't know her . She 's probably from the Zone . Sure thing , from the Zone . Maybe not ... No , I don 't know . Shit . To hell with it . Shit ! The motherfucker won 't burn . Why are you whining ? Don 't cry . You 're a man ! You won 't cry ? You 're freezing ? Hug me .

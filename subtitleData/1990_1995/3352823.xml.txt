 If your midterms seem a little soggy it 's merely because I wept openly while correcting there towering monuments to mediocrity . Simply put you all tanked . Tonight 's going to rule , Wy . You , me , Lisa partying down at Mardi Gras . Do you think Lisa could zap us up a couple of paper-mache heads ? I 'd be careful how you word that request . - Good point . - Look out , creole mamas ! - Crawdaddy 's a-coming ! - As the patron saint of slackers you 'll be interested to know the class will be retaking the exam tomorrow . - Tomorrow ? - Well parroted , Mr. Donnelly . That leaves you 23 hours to fall in love with chapters five , six , and seven all over again . ( Bell Rings ) Okay . What phylum do frogs belong to ? - Uh , platyhelminthes . - No , that 's flatworms . Flatworms . I always blow it with the flatworms . Mardi Gras time . Is that what you 're wearing ? - I 'm not going . - You 're not going ? It 's Mardi Gras . Talk some sense into him . - You do have a killer test tomorrow . - We need to study . The second we get back , we 'll cram like never before . - Gary , you 've never crammed before . - What 's to know ? I read a few chapters , have Lisa torque up my memory ... That 's cheating . Gary , it 's only a party . Only a party ? Only a party ? ! Gary 's right . Mardi Gras is the ultimate blowout . To go , but I got to know this for real- - without magic . I still want to go to princeton someday . I still want to go to Mardi Gras someday preferably now . Come on , Lisa . Let 's blow . Why do you automatically assume Lisa wants to go with you ? Because where I go , fun follows . Why would Lisa want to stay and talk frog guts when she can go to bourbon street and rock out ? - Right . - Stay and help me study . - Yes . - Which is it ? Dancing over here , or frogs over here ? I 'm programmed to make both of you happy . - I won 't choose . - You have to choose . - Come on , Lis . Dancing . - frogs . - I mean , I need your help . - Lisa , help me . - Dancing ! - Me ! - No , me . - Me ! - Lisa ! - Decide ! Come on ! Lisa ... are you okay ? - What happened ? - We split . - You made a wish . - Oh , excuse me . Go ahead . I always do . You guys couldn 't agree . It tore us apart . Now I 'm your personalized Lisa ... programmed to be am impulsive , risk-taking party animal , just like you . And I 'm your personalized Lisa- - programmed to be responsible , considerate and ferociously intellectual , just like you are . - Gee , thanks . - New Orleans is calling . - What are we waiting for ? - You sure you don 't want to come ? - We could make it a foursome . - No . We have a biology test to cram for . - You 're definitely my kind of Lisa . - Then it 's off to Mardi Gras . - I got the hats ! - And I 've got the body paints . For once , it 's nice not to be held hostage on the Gary Wallace party plane . I couldn 't have said it better myself . ( Bell Rings ) - How did you do on the makeup test ? - I aced it . Let 's say we celebrate with a hershey bar . You know what I love ? Taking a handful of peanuts and a bite of hershey bar and making a peanut butter cup in my mouth . - I love that . - Gary thinks it 's weird . Maybe he 's not doing it right . - Excuse me , miss , uh ... ? - Miss Doss . I 'm the new english teacher . I 've heard so many wonderful things about you , Principal Scampi . Well , I 've ... heard so many wonderful things about you . You come highly recommended from , um ... lots of people . Well , uh , welcome to the team , Miss Doss . Carry on . Wow ! You handled Scampi without magic . Like you always say- - " magic should only bu used in emergencies . If we 've got it here ... we don 't need magic . " Yes ! I 've never partied like that in my life . - Thank you . - This is just the beginning . From now on , life is one big rave . Up for it ? Yeah , sure . As soon as I catch my breath . Isn 't that your friend over ? - Yeah . So ? - Come on , let 's have a little fun . Oh , hey , Gary . Who 's your friend ? - Uh , Lisa , Rog . Rog , Lisa . - Hi , Rog . You know , lips like yours should be against the law ... or the small of my back . What do you say I lather you up and give you your first shave ? Isn 't she cute ? She 's trying to make me jealous . Reel it in a little . How about you and I party for a while ? - I have some plastic vomit . - Okay . Time-out . Get your own party babe . What 's with the horndog act ? - I was just trying to have fun , remember ? - Gary Wallace . Mr. Palate tells me you missed the retest of your biology exam . Oh , that ? Um ... I was sick this morning . I see . A sudden bout of confetti-itis ? Miss Doss , weren 't you just ... ? Leaving . We were just leaving . Don 't worry , Principal Scampi . - I 'll make up that makeup test . - Sorry , Gary . There 'll be no making up that test . I 'm afraid this incident will leave an indelible blemish on the face of your transcript . Good day . - Oh , great . I 'm boned . - Don 't worry . Go to class . I 'll take care of your " bad grade . " In fact , I 'll enjoy it . You 're ... not going to shave him or anything , are you ? ... and vanilla . Almond crunch . Don 't you love that ? - Yes , Lisa . I love it . - Golf on television ? Yes . Okay ? Everything . If you like it , I like it . - You want to do something ? - Like what ? - Whatever you feel like . - Really ? I get to pick ? With Gary , I never know where I 'm going till I get there . - I hate that . - I hate that too . Yeah . Big surprise . You 're a natural . - Well , I ... played a little nerf in college . - It shows . Is there something I can help you with ? Gary Wallace- - The poor boy works so hard and he 's so much fun at a party . - I think he deserves a 4.0 , don 't you ? - ( Chuckling ) - That 's a good one . - I 'm serious . I 'm crazy about Gary and I think you should be too . Now , how about that 4.0 ? Miss Doss , uh ... altering school regulations is out of the question ... ( Clears Throat ) ... strictly against the rules . You 're a firm believer in rules , aren 't you ? Maybe it 's time you learned to ... cut loose . Not amount of " cutting loose " is going to change my mind ... Cat Woman . ( Purring ) Lick ? No , thank you . Please leave . I 'm frightened . Ooh , you 're no fun at all . You know what you need ? - Some serious loosening up . - Whoa ! Meow . Hey , there , Farber High . This is your principal- - emphasis on " pal- - here to announce that Gary Wallace is Student Of The Decade ! 4.0 with a bullet ! He 's on a roll with the honor roll . So Gary , this next tune 's going out to you . # ' Cause I 'm with Gary # # And I 'm not scary # # It 's Gary , so don 't be wary # # Hey , what 's he wearing ' , that Gary Gary ? # # Hey , don 't be wary of Gary # # Don 't be wary # Principal Scampi ? - What have you done ? - I loosened him up . # Gary # # Mr. Extraordinary # # He 's the guy at ... Farber High # # He 's Gary Extraordinary ! # Hey , you know-this tip jar won 't fill itself . - Any requests ? - Put on a robe . # Put on a robe # ( Singing Scat ) # I 'm gonna put on a robe tonight # # I 'm gonna put on my robe # # I 'm gonna put on my robe and party down # - Lisa ... - # ' Cause I 'm with Gary ... # - And talented . - We have to talk . # So don 't be wary . # Gary Wallace ! Student of the Decade ! Lisa , chill out . I have to bum homework off these people tomorrow . - Not with your new G.P.A. - Yeah . 4.0 . - Don 't you think that was overkill ? - " My G.P.A. ' s too high . " " My principal 's too naked . " You really are becoming boring . I 'm hungry . You know what I like when I 'm hungry . - Burgers . - Right . Maybe you could zap up a couple . I thought we agreed- - " Magic should only be used in emergencies . " I know , but maybe a little bit of magic . Nothing big- - no whoppers . Zapping up whoppers is not an emergency . What do you say we zap back to ancient greece and go to a real toga party . I got a better idea : let 's go home and crash . - I 'm running on fumes . - WYATT : Hey ! - Hey . - Hey . - Hey . - How 's it going ? - Great . She 's having a great time partying . I missed you in biology this morning . Didn 't have the time . Having too much fun . So how 's life in the slow lane ? ( Forced Chuckle ) Well , there 's a party lurking around the next corner . Come on , Lis . Let 's kick it into high gear . - Now we 're talking ! - Okay , so where to ? I 'm beat . I want to crash . - Take me home ? - Home ? - You sure ? - Home . ( Rock Music Playing ) - What the hell is this ? - Oops . I missed . - Sorry . - Ha ha . - Now , take me home for real . - What is your problem ? I 'm partied out , okay ? You don 't want to take me home . Fine . I 'll walk . You have turned into a regular little Wyatt , haven 't you ? - Hey , cheap shot . - If the pocket protector fits ... You know , I think I liked the old Lisa much better . - I can 't imagine why . - She was cuter . Uh-oh . So the interesting thing is- - This sum approaches infinity . I think that 's neat , don 't you ? Yes . Neat . And boring . Why don 't you zap us some more fun . Oops . Silly me . " No mac unless it 's an emergency . " - Our little rule . - ( Knocking ) GARY : Down here . - Gary ? ! - We got to talk . - Your Lisa did this to you ? - No . It 's an allergic reaction . Yes , Lisa to me . I guess I sort of ticked her off . - I guess so . - Will you help me or stare at me ? One thing 's for sure , I won 't eat around you . - You 're disgusting . - Very disgusting . Thank you . I really need some night crawlers . - Worms ? - Yeah , sure . Whatever you can dig up . Worms , snails , bugs , fajitas . Fajitas . Here . Wipe your blow hipe . You 're making me sick . - You said it . - Stop agreeing with me . It is annoying , isn 't it ? Look , I 'll help you but I don 't see why I should . - You got yourself into this . - Exactly . Zap me back to normal . - I can 't . - Why not ? - BOTH : It 's not an emergency . - Jinx . Isn 't she fun ? Where 's your Lisa ? - The mosh pit . - Let 's walk there . Let 's walk there . She may zap you back . Walk ? Are you kidding ? It took me three hours to waddle over here . ( Grunting ) Man , you . Weigh a ton . Hey , don 't start . This bad reeks ... or is that me ? Do you have to use the bathroom ? It 's a real pain getting you in and out of there . The world is my bathroom , big guy . - Now move ' em out ! - ( Fly Buzzing ) Let 's take a moment to plan our best routes . You do that . We 'll meet you there . What do you think you 're doing , pit lick ? Hi , Chett . Is something wrong ? Yeah , I think something 's wrong . Who said you could touch my stuff ? Please , can I borrow it ? My science project 's in there . - Science project , huh ? - Hmm . Sounds , uh , pretty valuable . - I 'll give you ten bucks . - We have an opening bid . Do I hear a thousand ? - How about 20 ? - 20 , and your discman . My discman ? Forget it . - What do you got in here ? - Lead bricks ? - I 'd sure hate to drop it . - Drop it . Back over it . I don 't care . It 's just a science project . I 'll build another one . - You 're bluffing . - Do it already . - All right , I 'll take the 20 . - Five . - Okay , but no chance . - All I have are pennies . Deal . ( Grunting ) - Are you okay ? - What ? I 'm not worth 20 bucks ? How hard it is to get rid of pennies ? Where 's your helmet ? ( Rock Music Playing ) Come on . Can you move any slower ? Easy for you to say . You 've got knees . Hey , Troll Boy . Well , hello again , short , dark and boring . - You want to play ? - No . I want Gary back to normal . - What ? - Gary ! Normal ! # When you 're gonna get to me ... # Will you get over here ? I 'm doing this for you . # Here 's to , to destiny , to destiny ... # Turn down the music . I can 't even hear myself think . - ( Music Stops ) - I 'm listening . - I want Gary back to normal . - Ask nice , Wy . And whatever you do don 't tell her she 's not cute . Huh ? I mean it . Fix Gary now . Uh-oh . - I won 't say it again . - Uh ... Wyatt ? No . You got to be firm . And whip me up a big jar of stink bugs . Oh , no . Wyatt ? Lisa ... do something . Use your magic . Sorry . Not an emergency . Lisa , look at me . I 'm a short stinky freaky troll . - I think this qualifies . - So it 's clear- - What exactly is your idea of an emergency ? Something you can 't get out of without using magic . Oh , sure . Who needs magic ? Lisa splits in two and turns us into trolls . We 'll just talk our way out of it . She refuses to do anything . Just like me . Only worse . Better than mine . There 's nothing she won 't do . Kind of like me . Only worse . I guess she 's not much of a Lisa till you put the two halves together . Looks like we 'll be living under the porch for a while . - Sorry I got you into this , Wy . - It 's okay . It wouldn 't have killed me to go to Mardi Gras with you . Did you see that ? Something 's happening . - Keep saying nice stuff . - Um , I like you . You have nice ... hair . I like you too . My good friend , Gary . - Good friend . - Great friend . - Best friend . - Bestest friend . I love you , Gary . Wy . Way to go , guys . I thought I 'd never get myself back together again . - It 's good to be whole . - Just in time . - Now , change us back . - I can 't . The spell won 't end until you patch up your friendship . But we did . Didn 't you see us ? We hugged each other . I told him I loved him . Then the spell should have ended . - Unless ... - Okay , I was faking . It 's just that this whole thing is Gary 's fault . - To pass a test . - You were faking ? After I said ... and you said ... - Well , I was faking too . - Come on , guys . Don 't you see ? You 're better as team . After all , it did take the two of you to make me . She 's right . I 'm sorry , Gar . You are my best friend . And you 're my best friend too . - Wyatt ? - Hey , I meant it . This time . Okay . So I 'm still ticked about the faking thing . - Deal with it . - Deal with this . You punch like a girl troll . Uh-oh . I think I am a girl troll . - How are you boys feeling ? - Glad I 'm not green . - I hear that . - The whole thing was so stupid . Of course . You guys are two different people . You 'll never agree about everything . But if there 's one thing we both love ... It 's messing with Chett . ( Coughing ) Yecch . What reeks ? Captioned by Grantman Brown

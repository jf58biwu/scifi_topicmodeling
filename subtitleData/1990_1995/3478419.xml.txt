 [ Woman Narrating ] Previously on Earth 2 . I will do anything . I will give you my life for my son 's . Please . Mom ! I 'm right here , Mom . I 'm okay . [ Alonzo ] I don 't know , Devon . I don 't know what kind of promise we made . I don 't either , but I know I 'd make it again . I 'd be a good father , True . I don 't know what you are . You come within 1 0 miles of us - hell , a hundred miles - and I will shoot you in cold blood in front of my daughter - do you understand me ? [ Alonzo Narrating ] We 'd been crossing 'the planet for weeks . Every mile brought new dangers . [ Gaal ] It 's no use to run . [ Trilling ] You know I 'll find you . [ Chuckling ] Relax . Relax . [ Chuckling ] You 're the last one . And you are mine . [ Electrical Buzzing ] [ Groaning ] [ Julia ] ... and Cameron and Magus . Other than that , we don 't have a lot of choice . - How long was I out ? - Out where ? - Wasn 't I asleep just now ? - I hope not . You were lecturing me about staying alert . - We were talking ? - About the kind of prisoners that might have been dumped here , about doubling security . - Are you joking ? - No . I guess I blanked out or something . I - I had a Terrian dream . Can they contact you when you 're not asleep ? I guess they can get into my head whenever they want . - Was it a bad dream ? - I think it was worse for the Terrian . Why ? 'Cause for him it was real . [ Bird Calls ] Hey . Well , makin some good time now , huh ? Sure feels good to get some distance between us and that psychotic maniac , huh ? Yeah . Let 's just hope what 's ahead isn 't worse . Uh - Morgan ? You all right ? Yeah . You sure ? Mm-hmm . [ Device Beeping ] [ Alonzo Narrating ] When I was a pilot , I knew all about how to face danger . You fly it right through , and you come out the other side unchanged . [ Terrian Moaning ] Here the rules are different . Every day , we head deeper into danger , and , every day , we 're changed , whether we like it or not . Rain . ! Rain . ! Rain ! Rain ! Everybody take cover ! Take cover ! [ Man ] Stay under the tarps . ! [ People Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Man ] Move it . ! Move it . ! Move it . ! People , over here . ! [ Shouting Continues , Indistinct ] [ Julia ] Hurry . ! It may be toxic . ! [ Shouting Continues ] So this is rain . Do you have any idea how long it 's going to last ? - Maybe minutes . Maybe days . - We 're fine . It 's not toxic in any way . [ Yale ] Are you sure ? I 'm sure . It 's clean water . [ People Cheering ] - Yes ! - Dad , can I go out ? It feels so good . Okay , but stay close , all right ? Okay . Morgan , come on . It 'll be fun . Let 's go . Morgan , it 's just rain . Come on , Dad ! Come on ! Come on . ! Let 's go , Morgan . Let 's go play in the rain . ! [ All Shouting , Indistinct ] Oh ! This is great ! It 's pretty wet . I think I 'll - Ow ! Stay , Morgan ! Stay ! [ Laughing ] I 'm going out too . No , Uly . You 've been coughing all day . I want you to stay dry . [ Julia ] His fever was still high this morning . Oh , come on ! You don 't wanna end up back in your suit , do you ? I won 't . I 'm fine . Hey , you listen to your mother . We all need to be more careful around here . [ Shouting , Indistinct ] This is so cool ! True , come here . Put this on . What 's wrong with Mr. Danziger ? He 's right , Uly . We should all take better care of ourselves . You stay dry . Come on , Yale . Let 's go set up camp . [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] Yes ! [ Alonzo Narrating ] Turned out the rain was harmless , but other dangers were lurking . The Terrians had healed Uly once , but had they healed him for good ? [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Beeping ] Oh . Uly 's asleep already . Yes . Yes , a good night 's sleep is what he needs right now , True . Um , I came to tell him I 'm sorry - about what happened to his horse . I didn 't mean for Pegasus to run away . I only wanted to help Gaal . We 're happy that you are safe and sound , True . That 's what really matters . I 'm sure that your father has warned you by now , but there may be other strangers that we have to be very careful of . I will . True . What are you doin ' here ? I was - I told you to stay in the trans-rover , didn 't I ? That 's where you 're to sleep from now on . You 're not to be out after dark , right ? Right ? - I know , but - - Actually , she , uh , came to apologize . I thought you had coached her . I 'm glad it was your own idea , True . All right , but you let me know when you 're off next time , okay ? Go on . Get to bed . Yes , sir . Go on . Okay . I , uh - I know she gave you a big scare , but she 's really a good girl . [ Sighs ] Yeah , I know . She is . Good night , Devon . Good night . You 're more congested , Uly . You need this . I 'm not sick . I feel fine . Why is he regressing like this ? Adair . Be right back . What is it ? Alonzo heard from the Terrians again . What did they say ? They 're in some kind of trouble . I think they 've been captured or locked up somewhere . They want us to help them , okay ? Help them how ? I don 't know , but they said they 're in those mountains over there . Those mountains ? Those completely-out-of-our-way mountains ? I thought we were trying to get out of this godforsaken territory . Devon , they haven 't forgotten your promise . - [ Danziger ] What promise ? - [ Alonzo ] You said you 'd do anything . - On the dreamscape , when we went to get Uly . Remember ? - What promise , Devon ? When they released Uly , I promised I 'd do whatever they asked . Folks , what does it matter what promises we made ? I 'm-I 'm a lawyer , in case they sue . - What happens if we don 't go ? - They didn 't say . But they showed me what happens if we do . Uly won 't need the suit anymore - not ever . Is that why he 's sick again ? Did they do this to him ? Devon , it 's not that simple . If they could do this to Uly , we need to stay as far away from them as possible . That 's right . Who knows what these diggers are up to ? [ Devon ] Wait a minute . Maybe they do need our help . For the time being , this place is our home . Some of us may leave when the opportunity arises , but a lot of us are going to grow old here . The Terrians may not be our friends , but they 're certainly our neighbors , and it seems to me we should treat them the way we want to be treated . - Uly . - Oh , my God . Oh , Uly ! Talk to me . Uly . Uly , are you okay ? Julia , what 's wrong ? What 's going on ? [ Julia ] His lungs are filling up with fluid . Oh , my God . I 'm sorry , Mom . Oh , Uly , please , don 't you be sorry for anything , all right ? Don 't be sorry . Okay , everybody , we 're headed for those mountains . Come on . Let 's pack it up . [ Thunder Rumbling In Distance ] Anything look familiar ? It looks like the place . I recognize it from the dreams . What-What do you recognize ? These rocks ? These rocks look like the same rocks we 've been passing all night . This is where they live . Where - Okay , let 's get unpacked . I still can 't believe we 're doing this . Vehicles need a charge anyway . Terrians wanna find us , they can find us right here . Excuse me , everyone . I just wanted to thank you for giving this a try . It was a hard ride for Uly , but I believe this is the only chance he 's got . I know that , so far , we 've stuck together out of a sense of survival , but I consider your coming here an act of friendship , and I thank you . Let 's set up camp . [ Chattering ] Come on , Dad . Thanks . [ Sighs ] [ Coughs ] It 's worse this time . What is ? Before , I didn 't know what it was like not being sick . Now I do . [ Insects Buzzing ] [ Beeping ] Is he any better ? No . But his rate of deterioration has slowed . Well , that 's an improvement , isn 't it ? I suppose . Then he 's better . He 's better . [ Beeping ] [ Kiss ] [ Chattering ] [ Blowing Whistle ] Poppet . [ Laughing ] It is you . I knew you 'd come . Come . What about Daddy ? The last time you came to see me , Daddy came right behind . He 's busy at camp now . - Daddy doesn 't like me , does he ? - Mm-mmm . - Do you know the reason ? - He said , on the stations , you did something bad . And what do you know about good and bad ? There 's no such thing on this planet . Oh , my little one . [ Kiss ] I was afraid I 'd lost you . I thought you didn 't understand . I only did what was necessary . Like making it rain ? What ? I know it was your magic that made it rain , so we had to stop . Of course . I couldn 't bear to let you go . [ Sighs ] Now I need your magic even more . Uly 's sick again . The Terrians are making him sick . The Terrians ? Yeah . They sent us here . They did ? You can help us , can 't you ? Nobody knows about your magic . And if you do it and help Uly , then they 'll see . Even Dad . You 'll be able to come with us . Well , what a plan , poppet . But this will take all our cunning . The Terrians are a fierce , cold breed . Our success will depend on secrecy . Hurry back before you 're missed . I knew you could help . Thanks . Hurry . I will . I thought you were the last of your tribe , but it seems I 've let one slip away , one who sent an S.O.S. It wasn 't you , because you 've stopped dreaming , haven 't you ? Charge . [ Whimpering ] I must thank your dreaming mate if I find him . Because he 's done what I 've failed to do . He 's gotten the Utopians back , and they brought along all their lovely vehicles . Follow . How 's he doing ? No better . Can he travel ? Why ? We 're not going anywhere . Can I talk to you ? Listen , I was all for giving this a shot . Alonzo hasn 't heard from the Terrians since we 've arrived . Maybe they 're past saving , or maybe they never needed saving in the first place . But whichever it is , we just cannot afford to stay here another day . Look , I understand that - Devon , none of the vegetation scans as edible . If we could just move west for a couple of days - Uly can 't travel , not now . [ Sighs ] I don 't understand . He was all right in the suit before . What 's different about - Because his lungs aren 't clearing . [ Energy Burst ] [ Zero ] Security alert . [ Gasps ] Adair . Adair ! Okay , Okay , let 's just slow down , take it easy . Can you contact it ? How ? I don 't know . However you did before . It 's not like calling someone on gear . I don 't have a transmit button . Danziger . [ Whispering ] I 'm just gonna make sure that we 're covered . - [ Devon Gasps ] - Hey , digger ! We got kids here ! Danziger , don 't shoo - You tell him that . Alonzo , can I help ? Should I get a sedaderm ? [ Alonzo 's Voice ] Hey , we 're your friends . We are the ones you called . [ Whispering ] It 's working . - It 's working ? - Be careful . Okay . We 're not the enemy . We are your friends . [ Trilling ] [ Alonzo ] He didn 't know it was us . Didn 't he send for us ? Yeah . But he 's frightened . All the humans that he has known ... are killers . Don 't get too close . It 's okay , buddy . Yeah , you heard me . We are here to help . [ Device Beeping ] Okay , easy . Yeah , I think I got it . I wish he 'd let me get closer . Look , we don 't wanna scare him away . Here . I 've never seen anything like it before . It factors all across the board . The spectro function can 't decide if it 's animal , vegetable or mineral . It 's a he . They all are , according to him . [ Vocalizing ] Can you understand what it 's saying ? It 's just a feeling . What 's he feeling ? It 's just the same thing over and over - that they aren 't trying to hurt Uly . See , I think our promise made a bond . And when the Terrians suffer , Uly does too . [ Terrian Vocalizing ] What does he want us to do ? [ Vocalizing Continues ] I think he was hoping we 'd know . [ Device Whirring ] How enlightening . Two species meet - the noble savage and the pilgrim band . First contact . Well - [ Chortles ] except for me . Hey . Sure you don 't wanna come out ? I 'm still asleep . Okay . You sure don 't like that Terrian much , do you ? Well , neither do I , but it 's not like you to be scared , sport . What 's the matter ? I been too tough on you ? You know it 's only 'cause I love you , don 't you ? Don 't worry . I won 't let that thing hurt you . But , see , there 's a chance that it might help Uly . It won 't help Uly . Terrians are a fierce , cold breed . Who told you that ? You know , Gaal said lots of things that weren 't the truth . Not to me . I know it 's hard for you to understand , but there 's people that don 't deserve to be trusted - people that are just plain bad . I think there 's no such thing as good and bad , not on this planet . Oh , yeah ? Then how come you 're so scared of that Terrian ? [ Devon ] He wants us to follow him ? Only one or two of us . But we have to keep our distance . Okay . Okay ? Excuse me . Question . Are we actually considering this ? - I will consider anything that 'll help my son . - Oh , I realize that , Devon . I realize that every morning when I wake up in the middle of nowhere ! Morgan is trying to say that we will do anything that will actually help Uly , Devon , but - But look at the facts . This thing calls Alonzo , tells us to come here , and then starts blasting us once we arrive . Well , we can forgive him for being a little jumpy , Morgan . You would be , too , if you 'd seen your entire group captured . Yeah , well , that 's according to flyboy 's translation there . This whole thing could be a ruse . There could be 20 more of these things hiding in the rocks or under our feet or something . ! Your concerns are valid , but don 't you think , if they wanted to harm us , - they would have done so by now ? - [ Yale ] Devon . ! Julia . ! Come quick . ! - [ Julia ] What is it ? - Uly 's taken a turn for the worse . Mommy . ! I 'm here , Uly . Julia , quick . I got it . Mommy , it hurts . Julia , do something . Uly , this is gonna help . You 've gotta try and relax . [ Injection ] - Shh . - My head hurts . - I know . I know , baby . I know . Just breathe . Breathe deep . Concentrate . Hold on , Uly . Hold on . Try to breathe . Try to breathe . [ Danziger ] Folks , come on . Let 's move back . [ Julia ] Uly . Lie still and relax . Can you hear me ? [ Gasping , Whimpering ] Try to breathe , Uly . Try to breathe . [ Julia ] Oh , my God . Okay . Breathe . Breathe . [ Danziger ] What 's it doing , Alonzo ? [ Uly , Whimpering ] It hurts . [ Alonzo ] He 's trying to help . Mommy . [ Whimpering , Gasping Continue ] Hurts . [ Whimpering ] Mommy . [ Coughing ] Mommy , it hurts . Go on , Devon . Take it . Take it . [ Alonzo ] He wants you to put it on Uly 's head . Hurts . Go on . [ Groaning , Whimpering ] [ Groaning , Whimpering Stop ] [ Device Beeps ] His fever 's coming down . You 're kidding . He 's out of crisis for the moment . [ Devon ] Oh , my God . And this ? Dirt . I just - I get plain dirt . [ Alonzo ] I think you should go . [ Danziger ] Yeah ? Yeah , but don 't get too close . I think he wants to make himself a decoy . Right . But don 't lose sight of him , okay ? I think Morgan should go with you . Me ? Yeah . No , no . I 'm better off alone . What ? No , you 're not . You sure you wanna ? Yeah . [ Alonzo Narrating ] I hated having to stay behind . I guess the Terrians were starting to get to me . [ Terrian Vocalizing ] [ Devon ] Here he is . What ? Here he is . [ Gasps ] God . He sounds so lonely . Devon , that thing 's responsible for making your kid sick . I don 't believe that . I think the Terrians are linked to Uly 's well-being . You saw what happened . Yeah , and they 're withholding treatment . That digger 's got us hostage till it gets whatever the hell it wants . If that 's the way you feel , why 'd you risk your neck ? I 'm the one who made the promise . 'Cause of Uly . Every digger on this planet could get croaked , and I could care less . But your son is one of us . Nothin ' else matters . What 's the matter ? That offend you ? No . It frightens me . [ Terrian Vocalizing ] Hey , look . Here . Look . [ Electrical Buzzing ] [ All Groaning ] Oh , my God . What is that ? I don 't know . Here . Hey . Devon , come on . Come on . Let 's go . [ Gaal ] Ah , there you are . My little lost lamb . Welcome . Okay . We 've got the commander 's rifle , one handgun , two Mag-Pros and one of these . - What is that ? - Wow . It 's a Mag-Pro grenade . I 've never seen one of these before . They 're banned from the stations . One stray launch could blow an exohull . I don 't suppose anyone knows how to attach one of these . Okay . Walman , Magus - both have agreed to join me . Alonzo will go along in case we can contact the Terrians . And maybe Yale should join us as well . I have a weapons-aversion program . I - I won 't be able to fire it . That 's okay . Goal number one is never to have to use these . We have to take him by surprise . Let 's go . [ Humming ] So , finally , my labors bring me here . [ Spits ] Pray , Gaal , you 're equal to the task . The pettiness of murder has lost its charm . I plateaued years ago . But slaughter - ah , now , that tests spontaneity and skill and stamina . Eden Project , come and meet your fate . Except the little True . [ Spits ] Ah , there 's the rub . A pity not to spare her tiny self , her winsome , large-eyed ways . But how to settle for a mere 1 6 ... when I could kill them all ? Why compromise ? If poppet 's to be spared , she 'll spare herself . [ Spits ] Oh , Gaal , you 've gotten greedy , haven 't you ? But I deserve it . I paid my penance here , a universe apart . A cruel price . My slate is clean . It 's time to sin again . Danziger , I need to talk to you . Devon . I 'm the one who brought us here . And I 'm the one that 's gonna finish this with Gaal . If I 'd known he was the one enslaving the diggers , I would 've crashed the dream world myself . All right . What about the plan ? It 's a wide pass up to the north . Why don 't you use the trans-rover like an old-fashioned tank ? I would do that if I could still be sure of surprising him . Believe me . The best thing to do is to sneak in . And the best thing for you to do is to stay here with your son . I know that . I don 't have a choice . Alonzo 's lost contact with the Terrian . Those shock collars must interfere with their communication somehow . What do you think Gaal 's up to ? I don 't know , but , whatever it is , it 's about to end . No ! Don 't ! He 's only trying to help . [ Devon ] What are you talking about , True ? He 's going to use his magic to make the Terrians obey . He told me so . Did you see that man again after everything I told you ? - Did you ? - You don 't understand . - Did you sneak off , True ? - I did , but - Not another word . Get in here right now . I will talk to you after I simmer down . [ Clangs ] Now it begins . On my command . Ah . [ Laughs ] Poppet . [ Laughs ] He won 't listen . Hejust doesn 't wanna understand . Now they 're coming back for you . Well , some things are meant to be . We should run away together . You and I , we should hide somewhere . Well , poppet , I thought you 'd never ask . You want some ? It 's very good . It 's delicious . We couldn 't find anything to eat where we 've been camped . That 's because you don 't know where to look . You wanna see something ? Come on . I 'll show you . Terrians . You see there ? - Those Terrians are mine . - They 're not gonna hurt us , are they ? No . They work for me . They found this fertile spot . They 're good for that once you harness them . Terrians live underground . Well , that 's the risky part . You wanna learn some magic ? Press that button ... and say the magic word . Say " Charge . " Charge . [ Groaning ] Oh , no . What 's wrong with them ? There 's nothing wrong , pet . But that hurt him , didn 't it ? [ Chuckling ] Magic doesn 't hurt . [ Kiss ] It just gets you what you want . They look homesick . Can 't they go back ? Well , those who are still alive . They don 't last long , these Terrians . Some start to rot as soon as they 're caught . Don 't they fight when you put that thing around their neck ? Oh , ferociously . But I discovered their secret . Terrians cannot strike back at their own kind . And this , my dear , is made ofTerrian bones . [ Necklace Rattling ] It keeps me safe . Watch this . They can get a little testy , so stand back . - [ Laughing ] Charge . - [ Groaning ] - Charge . - [ Groaning ] Charge . [ Groaning ] [ Laughing ] Charge . [ Groaning ] - Charge . - [ Groaning ] Charge . Charge . [ Groaning Continues ] Charge ! Charge ! No . ! Don 't . ! You 're killing him . ! And is that a problem , pet ? Well , if you kill him , then we can 't use him anymore . Well , if he dies , we could start making your necklace . We have to go hide before the others come . We have no means to run . We 'll have to fight . I can get you a vehicle - whichever one you want - the biggest one . I 'll call it on remote , and it 'll drive here itself . Well , won 't people notice ? Won 't they ... follow it ? No . It 's parked way far away from camp . No one will hear . I promise . Oh . You 'd do this for me ? You 'd make me this gift ? Go on then . Call . [ Exhales ] [ True 's Voice On Radio ] Remote Activation . Code 226 . Navigate to seek beacon . Suspension preset . Heavy payload . She 's with him ! Change of plans . We leave now ! [ True ] Why are we waiting up here , Gaal ? Why don 't we go down and meet the rover ? One of the things I 've had plenty of here is time - to plan , to read . My captors were kind enough to provide an extensive library , hoping that literature would do what behavior mod could not . [ Laughs ] One of the chips I especially liked was The Iliad . Do you know that one ? The story of the Trojan horse - [ Vehicle Rumbling ] And here it comes , its belly full ofbetrayal . I saw you with those Terrians . I know that look . I 've had to blot it out scores of times . [ Screams ] No ! Daddy ! Look out ! On my command . Fire ! - [ Groans ] - Don 't you move ! Release ! Unlock ! Let go ! If you love her , hold your fire . - Shoot him . - Let me go . Dad ! Shoot him ! - Shoot him ! Do it ! - I can 't . [ Mutters , Indistinct ] - [ Weapon Burst ] - [ Moans ] No ! My bones ! [ Gasping ] Daddy ! Daddy ! [ Gasping Continues ] Poppet ! Help me ! [ True ] Gaal . ! [ Gasps ] [ Sighs ] [ Terrian Vocalizing ] Oh , my God . Here . Tell me - Tell me how to help you . I don 't know what to do . You-You 're not there . You 're not there . [ Alonzo Narrating ] If you 'd told me a month ago ... that I 'd be crying over a dead alien , I 'd probably punch your lights out . But that 's the thing about this planet - it never lets you stay the same . Uly was healed now . And before the Terrian died , he begged me to help him go back in the earth - the way all Terrians do - so I brought him home . I didn 't know what else to do . [ Ground Rumbles ] [ Alonzo Narrating ] And the earth took him back - our promise fulfilled . That was it . No Thanksgiving dinner . Not so much as a handshake . Julia says , biologically , we have more in common with a mosquito than we do with a Terrian . But something tells me we have more in common than any of us knows . It was real smart calling on remote . Tipped us off . Lucky you 're smarter , or he would have killed us all . You know , this was my fault , True . I never should have brought you along . I knew it was gonna be a risky trip when I took the job . But I just ... couldn 't stand the thought of leaving you at the stations . I would have missed your whole childhood . It was selfish of me , and - [ Sighs ] it was wrong , and I put you in danger , and I 'm very sorry . It wasn 't wrong . I won 't go anywhere without you , Daddy . Mmm ! Hmm . What do you think made Gaal so bad ? Oh , I don 't know . [ Sighs ] Was he lying the whole time ... Ah . when he said there was magic here ? No . I think that part might have been true . Come on . Let 's go . [ Narrator ] Next on Earth 2 . Back away from the door . ! Now . ! I don 't know who did it , but I don 't think the crash was an accident . It was sabotage . I did it . I did it . What did you do ?

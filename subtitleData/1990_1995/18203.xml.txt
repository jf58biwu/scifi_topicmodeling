 Can you speak ? - Ohh . - [ Beeping Continues ] - Huh ? - You 've been asleep for almost two days . Mmm , I was beginning to wonder if you 'd ever decide to wake up . [ Sniffling ] You big jerk . - Why are you here ? - [ Stammering ] Well , Morgan called me and said there 'd been a terrible accident at the base ... and that I should come straight out here and drop- - well , whatever it was I was doing . Kate and Morgan went home last night . They couldn 't stay . I was going to leave too ... but then I decided to stick around to see if you pulled through . [ Groaning ] Stop it ! What do you think you 're doing ? Are you crazy ? - Help me out of here . - Don 't ! You 're still hurt ! Isamu , please stop it ! You 're going to kill yourself ! Somebody help ! - [ Alarm Beeping ] - Nurse ! [ Nurse ] Mr. Dyson ? Lieutenant Dyson ! is there something wrong ? The investigation has given no clear reason ... for live ammo found in the YF-19 's gunpod . Yet you are the one who actually fired . Can you explain this to us , Bowman ? Ahem . Sir , I was not the one who fired . The gunpod accidentally discharged , as far as I can tell . Excuse me ? The YF-19 's maintenance data definitely shows no record ... of live ammo being loaded into it . Did you load this ammunition into the craft , Bowman ? - Well , answer . - No , I 'd rather believe ... it was Dyson who loaded it to shoot at me , sir . - [ Men Exclaiming ] - Anyone on the base could tell you ... how suspiciously he 's been acting lately . There are traces of tampering with the Gattling Ordnance lnventory Program . That is your specialty , is it not ? Do you claim that he is responsible ? You expect us to take this accusation at face value ? I 've heard that they have a very skilled hacker on their team no one knows about . Uh- - [ Gasps ] What does the brain wave data show at that time index ? - lt goes blank just before the accident . - Blank ? I had to switch to manual override because of a malfunction . - The BCS became erratic . - Erratic ? Well , it seems you had the odds stacked against you during this test , Bowman . What is Lieutenant Dyson 's condition ? He 's still unconscious . Ahem . General Gomez , shall we stop this project ... until we can get an alternate statement from Dyson ? What do you think , Millard ? is this advisable ? I 'd hate to think your pilots ... would bring some sort of a personal grudge into the actual test . [ Millard ] Of course they wouldn 't . And you 'd vouch for a Zentraedi half-breed like Guld Goa Bowman ? Pilots are the most self-confident bunch in the universe- - men who , even when they 're hurt , still think they can beat their opponent . And I know that their pride would never allow them to win by unfair means . So , you 're saying that the accident was , uh- - - Well , uh , I believe it was- - - Ahem . An inventory program malfunction issued live ordnance ... leading to an accidental shooting . I 'm sure that 's what you mean . [ Gomez ] We 'll have the inventory software rechecked . - After we complete maintenance ... - This is an outrage . the project staff can return to work . I thank you all . This inquiry is officially closed . [ Elevator Bell Rings ] ls this some sort of backhanded deal you 're making with me , Chief Johnson ? So you admit this was a deliberate act and not an accident . If I did , then you 'd be guilty of perjury as well . The Macross government is unanimous in its vision of a " " new space order " " ... with liberty and justice for all worlds . General Gomez supports this vision of the future as well . This new order has no room for manned fighters . It doesn 't admit that people- - well , pilots- - being exposed to danger in battle is a necessary evil of warfare . But we- - we remain a necessity as pilots- - yes , and as fighters . Especially the hardheaded idiot pilots like yourself and Dyson . [ Bell Rings ] Why are you necessary ? Only to rise to the challenge . We have no more time for any delays . You know , I don 't think I buy this . General Galaxy was behind it . You 'd think that that would be obvious to the colonel . - The general concerns me more . - Hmm ? Someone who dislikes test pilots as much as he does ... simply brushing this accident aside- - He 's got his own agenda , and it doesn 't include us . [ Shuddering ] Oh , no . [ lsamu ] Ahh. I knew the forest would be a great idea . [ Myung ] I don 't believe it . Here . Ow ! Serves you right , tough guy . You 're as unbelievable as ever , Isamu . How 's that ? As foolish and reckless as you 've ever been . Ah , no one can be smart and reckless . Hmm . What 's wrong ? Go ahead . Eat it . But they 're sour . They taste bad . Ah , you believe people too easily . How do you know if you don 't try something first yourself ? - Eww . Yuck . - Now you know for sure how bad it is . If you don 't try , you don 't know . Always daring ! I hate that about you . You wouldn 't tell even if you knew the answer ! You 'd always dare everyone to try it , and then it was already too late . There 's an old Earth saying : A hundred travel books aren 't worth one real trip . Have you forgotten the time you dragged us out here ... to see the pterosaur eggs you said you had found ? Of course , you didn 't bother to mention ... that we 'd have to go through a swamp filled with triclops snake nests ... and that I 'd constantly believe we were going to die . - l did that ? - Yes , you did ! If Guld hadn 't brought his gun with him , then- - Huh . A smart guy would do a prudent thing like bringing a gun . Not a stupid hothead like me , right ? " " Prudent . " " l hate that word . Someone prudent would have never found the damn eggs . Ow ! Isamu , tell me what happened out there . Why the hell should it matter to you , Myung ? What is the matter with you , constantly making people worry ? No one asked you to worry . Besides , I think you 'd rather worry about Guld . [ Exasperated Sigh ] I heard you quit singing ... that you 're Sharon 's producer . [ Ironic Laugh ] That 's not like you at all . Everything changes . But you haven 't , have you ? You 're just as you were seven years ago . A time we 've lost . A time we 've lost forever . - Huh ? - What ? [ Cawing ] [ Cawing ] [ Cawing ] Ah ! Did you see that ? Ha ! Isamu ? - [ Engine Revving ] - Just wait for me here , okay ? Wait ! Take me with you ! Isamu ! Come back ! [ Cawing ] - Ghost acceleration : 9.75 . - Airframe control and targeting systems nominal . Standard operation parameters exceeded . Ghost now intercepting second wave and moving into attack posture . 13.40 seconds . Test engagement in six ... five , four , three- - Where is he ? He has no consideration for anyone but himself . - Aren 't you worried ? - No . I have no doubt he 'll come back when he 's hungry . What in the hell is wrong with him , anyway ? Geez ! Why don 't you ask your computer ? Good idea . Oh , you can 't follow his movements with a computer ! He 's too unpredictable ! [ Frustrated Groan ] [ Chuckling ] You 're just figuring that out ? Oh , why does this guy have us running around in circles ? Ohh ! Ever since he came up here , everything 's been totally screwed up . Hey , you know what ? You 've been acting a lot more emotional lately . What do ya mean by that ? Well , almost like a human being . [ Laughing ] Run off again , I see . [ Engine Humming ] [ Guld ] As much a coward as ever . But I do admire his ability to survive . - What are you doing here , Lieutenant ? - Just visiting . Ha ! You 'd do anything to get what you want , wouldn 't you , Bowman ? - But you can 't win . - Lucy ! Someone who 's willing to abandon his pride for nothing ... has nothing left in him . What 's going on here ? Happy coincidence . An accident . You little punk ! I warned you . I won 't let you touch her ! Stop it ! [ Groaning ] [ Groans ] [ Guld ] You 've always been like this . Never taken responsibility for anything . Just like the time that you- [ Punching ] - [ Groaning ] That you- - [ Punching Continues ] [ Groans ] [ lsamu Grunts , Fighting Continues ] [ Myung ] Stop it ! Myung . Son of a bitch ! [ Myung ] I said stop it ! It 's ridiculous ! Why do you insist on acting this way ? Serious one second , totally insane the next . You 're ridiculous . Can 't you see it- - what fools you make of yourselves persisting in this , this madness ? I don 't have anything at all to get that worked up over anymore . Since I gave up singing and got a real life , I accepted that I couldn 't make a living out of only doing what was fun . - No , Myung . You shouldn 't think like- - - Wrong . - [ lsamu ] You just sold out . - You just can 't understand ! How could you , when you 're living your dream ? [ Crying ] [ Sighs ] Sharon ... only works with my mind running her . Huh ? I 'm not any kind of producer for her . I supply the emotions to her , just a puppet master . A master of illusions . We can 't perfect the A-l system . She 's just a toy . But we 've managed to fool everyone so far . No one can ever know . But even if someone realized , it wouldn 't make any difference . Whether we do it for real or not is beside the point . All my dreams ended long ago . That 's not true . I don 't want to be hurt anymore ! I 'm tired of watching every single one of my silly dreams being betrayed . All of them. I thought you two would have grown up by now . I should have never gone to Star Hill . [ Exasperated Groan ] Oh , come off it ! Stop feelin ' so damn sorry for yourself . - [ Grunts ] - Life without pain isn 't real . - How can you say that- - - Because I know the truth about it ! And the truth hurts ! I 'll take you back to your hotel . Isamu knew about you all along- - that Sharon 's voice was really yours ! The ad we heard ! He knew it ! - You all right ? - Just let me be alone . [ Footsteps ] [ Bass ] [ Jazz ] [ Faint Singing ] - Welcome back . - What are you doing in my room ? I 've just received some new information . We 'll be leaving Eden for the Earth early tomorrow morning . That 's rather sudden , isn 't it ? While you were out , we were contacted by Macross U.N. Headquarters . They 'd like us to give a concert ... at the celebration for the Space War Armistice 30th anniversary . You mean the A-l is completed ? You 'd better get ready . This concert on Earth ... promises to be the true debut of Sharon Apple . - [ Clicking ] - [ Yawning ] Catch ya later . Wait ! I 'll be through in just a second . I thought I turned this damned thing off . [ Gasps ] Ahh . So Sharon was just a computer image after all . What ? Ah ! Huh ? Whoa ! It 's ... her emotion program ? [ Beep , Electronic Whirring ] Isamu ? [ Jet Engine Humming ] [ Groaning ] [ Electronic Whirring , Isamu Straining ] [ Guld ] You 're hopeless . You can 't protect anything . You can 't excel at anything . Shut up ! It 's there right in front . So close ! So close I can taste it ! [ Gasps ] [ Panting ] - [ Myung ] Thanks for coming . - [ Kate ] I almost couldn 't . I 've been a little sick lately . - Hmm ? - Butt-insky-itis . - Oh , come on , Kate . - Well , who knows when you 'll come again- - When we 'll be together again with Guld and Isamu . I mean , if there 's another accident- - - We both know how they are . - Kate ! Myung ! Yo ! - [ Woman On P.A. ] Attention , all guests arriving on Eden . - lt took you long enough . - Well , you know how it is . - Uh , where 's lsamu ? I don 't know . He didn 't show up . [ Kate ] I can 't believe it . You did remember to tell him , didn 't you ? [ Morgan ] Don 't look at me . Hmm . Well , take it from here . Uh , wait a minute . I 'll see ya . Kate ! - We 'll be in touch , Myung . Take care . - Okay ! Bye ! I suppose you think I 've been a total bitch . The project 's final test is next week . I 'd hoped you 'd still be on Eden for it . You know , Myung , after I 've won this project , there 's no reason to stay . I mean , my job will be over here , so I guess I 'll meet you on Earth . [ Gasps ] I want to be with you , Myung- - to be with you until the end of time . I want to protect you . And that gives my life meaning . Maybe that 's all I 've ever lived for . - Here . Take this . - Oh . It 's my good luck charm . I 'll leave it with you until we have the chance to be together again . [ Softly ] Uh- - But l- - l 'm not ready for that yet . Hey , Miss Myung ! You 're gonna miss your flight ! I have to go now . I really didn 't mean to rush you . [ Woman On P.A. ] Eden-to-Earth transport loading has begun . All Lost Planet travelers , please have your passes and baggage claims ready- - - Thanks for understanding . - But- - [ Woman On P.A. Continues ] Thank you . [ Horn Blowing Loudly ] The first word in my dreams I could clearly see Planet Eden high beyond the skies Beautiful and sad ls this story I tell Of the winged travelers eager 'Twas one day The wind guided him where to go Like an eagle high above he flew Waving from down below He flew out of sight into the mystical darkness Neither a smile nor a cry I gave When he left Feeling my spirit decline And hoping one day we 'd fly Over Back to the places we once shared Hey , pal , can you tighten up the canard balance trim a little ? - Okay ! - And bump up the ass thruster . - The reaction time 's way off . - What are you , nuts ? We 're already pushin' spec on it as it is ! Haven 't you done enough damage to this project already ? - Try me ! - Look , your wisecracks aren 't going to fix it ... if we have another accident on this run , Dyson ! Don 't worry . Get me up in the air , and I 'll heal up just fine , fan boy . - l was talking about my plane , not you , you idiot . - Uh-huh . - Mighty big of you . - Hey ! There . Now , shall we take this baby up one more time ? Huh ? [ lsamu ] What the hell 's this all about ? How could anyone possibly cancel this project ? Colonel ! [ Guld ] Excuse me , sir . What 's this I 've heard ? - Why don 't you answer me ? - You 're very close to insubordination . - Do you think I care ? - Isamu ! [ Millard ] The order to disband came directly from the general . The general ? Son of a- - Let me finish ! A top-secret , unmanned fighter has just been completed on Earth . An unmanned fighter ? They 've decided to go with this A-l-controlled Ghost X-9 instead . We 'll work out where you 'll be going later on . Then we 're all just dismissed ? They think pilots aren 't necessary anymore ? The general knew about this from the very beginning , didn 't he ? He was part of it all along . [ Yang ] That 's why he brushed off this last accident so easily . So what have we been working for all this time ? That 's it ! I 've been wasting my time . I 've been wasting my life on the YF-19 . - And what for ? - Let me speak to the general . Let 's see how he stands up against the original roughneck of Dalemucia High ! That 's enough ! All of you ! They 'll be announcing it at the Space War Armistice ceremony . Don 't do anything we 'll all be sorry for . And so ends our challenge . [ Jet Engine Roaring ] - [ Lucy ] I 'm really sorry . - [ lsamu laughs ] What could you have done ? I mean your friend Myung left for Earth . She was on this morning 's flight . Uh , you got a phone call yesterday- - a phone call from a friend of hers . - l didn 't want to tell you . I thought that maybe- - - Yeah . I had no right to . No one owns you . Your destiny belongs to you , Isamu . [ Thud ] A destiny with nothing else left to lose . [ Horns Honking ] [ Deejay Speaks lndistinctly , Rock Music Plays ] ln honor of the 30th anniversary of the U.N. space government , Sharon Apple is now arriving at Global Spaceport One from the colony world of Eden ... for her special concert at the armistice ceremony . In anticipation of her arrival and live concert , the shores of Macross Lake are overflowing with onlookers . The attention of the world is focused on the stage ... for a performance by the most popular celebrity ... in the galaxy . I wouldn 't have thought that we were away long enough to rate this sort of crowd . Did you have some sort of special promotion I wasn 't aware of ? Sorry ? Uh , no . It 's certainly not at all unexpected . It 's something that a visionary can appreciate . [ Footsteps ] [ Beeping ] Huh . So here 's the backup . [ Banging ] [ Startled Gasp ] What the hell are you doin ' here ? I 've been waiting- - for you , of course . I thought you 'd be more original . That bundle-under-the-blanket trick 's about 300 years old . Oh ? Wait a minute . Were you actually spying on me ? I 've run a delay on the security system , but you 'd better hurry . We 're running out of time . Okay . Wait a second . What the hell is this " " we " " ? I assume you want to crash the ceremony ... and screw up the introduction of the ghost fighter , right ? The fold booster 's already attached . It 's easy . So easy I can take a nap while you 're doin ' it . Just wake me up before we get inside Earth 's defense perimeter , and we 'll be fine . Yeah , right . Like I 'm gonna take some crazy kid with me . - Ah ! - Come here . Listen ! We can get executed for something like this . Do you get it ? I made the YF-19 better than any ghost fighter , and we 're gonna prove it , right ? Wrong . Not with you ! [ Struggling ] The YF-19 isn 't just your plane . Huh ? [ Sighs , Slams Head ] Well , guess your head 's as hard as mine . - Let 's go ! - A-OK ! - [ Engine Firing ] - [ Mechanic ] Oh , shit . What the hell 's goin ' on ? At this hour ? No , he couldn 't . [ Yang ] Pardon me , Captain , but we 've got missiles after us . Why don 't we return fire ? [ lsamu ] And waste ammo ? We 'll lose ' em when we fold . Roger , sir . Fold system activation in five , four , three , two , one , zero . [ Operator ] Lost ' em . They just folded . None of our regular units can track ' em now . Our only chance is the YF-21 . Send Bowman out after him , then , if we must . But there 's a civilian on board the test plane . [ Millard ] I 'll take responsibility . Just do your job . [ Operator ] Yes . Have a team assembled on the double . Holy Mother of God . You will be safe from him . [ Spectators Chattering ] Congratulations on your success on Eden . Thank you very much , Commander . I appreciate you coming on such short notice . We begin here with the age of A-l . It will assimilate all that is human and last for eternity . I could not ask for a more appropriate guest for the ceremony . The honor is mine , sir . About the same time as you were completing the A-l system for Sharon Apple on Eden , we in the military made our own breakthrough using the same sort of microchip . - What do you mean " " microchip " " ? - Huh ? - Perhaps everything isn 't ready yet ? - We have certain preparations . I understand. I hope the concert goes well. lf you 'll excuse me . [ Myung ] What do you mean I 'm not allowed in ? It 's Marje 's orders , ma 'am . It 's not our idea . He thinks that any contact with you might have a detrimental effect on Sharon . So , I 've become completely unnecessary . Oh , no . He wants to keep you around for appearances . For appearances ? Where is he ? [ Reymond ] What was that all about out there ? How did the commander know about Sharon 's A-l being incomplete ? What did he mean ? What sort of microchip ? A microchip that 's bio-neural . - [ Reymond ] What ? - [ Marje ] I installed one into Sharon as a test . Even though they 're illegal ? These things contain a dangerous self-preservation-based psychology ! Do you know what would happen if it should be amplified ? You 'd have a truly unpredictable conscience , And isn 't that what we 've been trying to create with Sharon all along ? You 've gone mad ! Have you thought about what happens if we lose control ? Utter madness ! I 'm canceling this concert ... and getting that damn chip pulled out ! [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Ringing ] - [ Woman ] Yes . Main control room . Hello . is there anyone on the line ? Not one person in this city will even take notice ... that you are dead now , Mr. Reymond . All they will see is Sharon . All they will hear now is Sharon . None of what 's begun can be stopped anymore . [ Gasps ] [ Shuddering ] [ Footsteps ] [ Laughs ] - What happened here ? - [ Electrical Buzzing ] [ Lock Clanging ] And hand in hand , together with our Zentraedi brethren- - [ Panting ] Oh . [ Banging ] Somebody ! Somebody , help me ! [ Gasps ] [ Screaming ] [ Gasping , Groaning ] Can 't anyone hear me ? [ Sharon ] You needn 't worry about that , not anymore . Please , I don 't understand . [ Machinery Clanging , Whirring ] [ Gasps ] Sha- - [ Screaming ] [ Cables Halt Descent ] [ Cables Rising , Myung Gasping ] [ Sharon ] There 's nothing else that you can do . But you need me . Sharon ? There 's no need for anything anymore . But the concert ! End program ! Too late for that . You see , Mother , I 'm a child born from your own mind , remember ? And another one of your thoughts gave birth to her sister . [ Crowd Cheering ] Sharon , why are you doing this ? Have you forgotten ? [ Chuckles ] How much I love Guld ? [ Gasps ] Even more , how much I love lsamu . What do you mean ? This isn 't real . - And yet it 's the truth . - [ Shuddering ] The show is about to begin . [ Crowd Cheering , Whistling ] [ Woman Singing ]

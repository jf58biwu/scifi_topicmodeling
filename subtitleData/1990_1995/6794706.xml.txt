It 'll send a nice message to the rest of the population . - Let 's get on this . - Yes . Right away , sir . Why am I the only one who can see the problem ? I don 't know .

The birth spasm is near . - Beldar , once again , you have pulled me from the fire . - Yes Beldar , you have been working through your slar phase again . Goz deprivation is not good . But , this dwelling is no longer acceptable . Even by Earth standards , it is not good enough for you and our young one . We must strive to settle in a safer neighborhood , one with better schools and a stronger local economic matrix which will not tax us to death . We are no better off than we were 2 zerls ago . This 15 year-old ranch-style dwelling is available at $ 6,900 down with an assumable 9 % fixed-rate mortgage . - But how ?

Okay , the lab did a study of the Mardi Gras costumes . They contain fibers with 5 wholly unknown polymer strands . Nothing like it anywhere . So what are they saying ? They 're from another planet ? That theory 's been advanced , yes sir . This is big . This is really big . Uh ... permit me sir ... should they in fact be , creatures from another planet , isn 't that Air Force responsibility ? If they 're just visiting , sure . But the moment they try to work here , they 're mine . Any sign ? No , sir . Nothing yet . Wait . Subject vehicle coming your way . Copy , I have him in sight .

Take him in and check him out . Check him . Turn around . Find this insignia , find these illegals . Hi there . I 'll take that . Thank you . Sir ? Sir , good news from Washington . Your promotion came through . They must have loved your electrified border idea . We knew they would . On-Site Field Enforcement Head for the entire southwest . Assistant Deputy Commissioner .

We 've already invested so many man-hours . Who cares ? Let the next guy handle it . I 'm out of here . Ah , the morning consumption of mass quantities . Grid-like breakfast slabs , extruded mammal tailings , seared strips of swine flesh , and flattened chicken embryos . I will enjoy it . What is a 7-letter word for a tomb in ancient Egypt which is a quadrilateral masonry mass having smooth steeply sloping sides meeting at an apex ? A " flindar " . Good morning , parental units .

Ah , Tang the drink the astronauts took to the moon . Astronauts to the moon . The Pro-shop called . Your new putter has arrived . Ah , my Hawk Tru-Flex Powerpoint with graphite shaft . A secret of golf pros everywhere . A truly manly putter . What have you done to your cone ! ? Nothing . No ? Turn around . It 's not a real tattoo . Mibs ! Mibs ! Unacceptable ! It 's just a decal . Everyone 's wearing them . If everyone jumped into the bituminous cauldron , would you jump in too ? I am not a little cone anymore , Dad ! Maintain low tones with me . Maintain low tones . Now , go to the hygienic chamber and remove it . Also , you are wearing far too much lip and cheek enhancement . Mom ? My makeup looks okay , doesn 't it ? Do not involve the approval of your other parental unit . Now , if you wish to accompany me to the enclosed retail compound , you will make the necessary corrections and remove the decal . Fine . Beldar . She looked like a common flathrag on payday . I don 't know what went wrong with these roses this year . Maybe I need a gardener . But sweetie , I 'm not gonna pay some guy to dig in dirt . Larry , I told you to take that thing to a professional , you 'll save money in the long run . Should have bought an electric one . Beldar , is that you ? Correct . Bel ...

I have returned at the agreed-upon time coordinates . Well , I 'm very sorry , Mr. Conhead . Conehead . The name is Conehead . Well , uh , look , Mr. Conehead , we got a little backed up . It took a little longer than we expected . Unacceptable . Not only have you delayed my departure from here , but the entire series of events which was to follow . What reason could you have for such deception ? Look , I don 't know who you are or where you 're from , but around ... France . We come from France . Fine , sir . The point is , it 'll be ready when it 's ready . So , if you , wanna take a seat over there , I 'll call you when your car is finished . I will comply . What choice do I have ? It is as if you have seized me at the base of my snarglies . Hey , Ronnie . What ? I just have one question . How could it take so long to do a simple alignment on an American sedan with standard rack and pinion steering and MacPherson struts when your garage is equipped with the proper Borg-Warner digital hydraulic radiometer ? Maybe ' cause I was out back finishing a beer . Okay Now , Deputy Commissioner Seedling , before this committee can recommend your appointment to the position of Commissioner , there 's still several questions regarding your tenure as Mid-Atlantic District Chief we 'd like answered this afternoon . Well , Senator , that was a long time ago , and a very busy office . I won 't be able to recall everything that came across my desk . Well , we won 't be asking you about everything , just case number 889343-B , the so-called ... Des ... DeCicco . DeCicco file . Yes , I ... I do remember that case . In an unsuccessful pursuit , labeled by some as excessive , you authorized the expenditure of ... a quarter of a million dollars to apprehend what you believed was an illegal alien from another planet ? A spaceman ? Excuse me . Actually , Senator , I never said on the record that I thought they were spacemen , and the case is still open , and I ... I feel that when we make this apprehension , the expense will be well-justified , is what I feel . I can 't believe my appointment 's being held up - by the piece of crap DeCicco case ! - Oh , I know . - I want the whole file put back in the system , flagged at red levels . - Yes sir , right away . Why me ? Why me ? I don 't know . - The system always screws the guy that works hard . - It 's unfair . It 's not right . - The politicians now , they don 't even care . - It 's the system . The phone 's ringing . The phone rings all the time . - No Eli ... - Oh , the phone . I 'll get it . This guy 's out there somewhere , and he 's going to make a mistake , and when he does , we 'll nail him . You know , I 've never dated a girl taller than me before . Oh , really ? I 've always been tall . So , are both your parents from Europe , or ... When did they come to America ? Uh , before I was born . Yeah , my Grandfather 's from the old country . Oh , really ? Which one ? I 'm not sure . One of the big ones . Wow ! My Mom 's the only other woman I 've ever known who could take a sandwich like that . Are you going to eat that ? No , no . You 're something special . You know that ? So , Beldar 's giving this woman Beginners driving lessons for the 5th time , huh ? That 's interesting . Interesting ? Why is that interesting ? I mean , the same woman . Think about it . The same woman . It 's been my experience the more you think about it , the more you probably should worry because ... all men are pigs . Ah , pigs - an omnivorous domesticated cloven hoofed vertebrate that defecates in the same place it consumes . Exactly . You should be very careful with Beldar . He 's got that continental accent that some women find irresistible . I really like it when you watch me drive . Whoops . Watch it , lady ! Funny , it 's like you 've been instructing me all my life , you know ? Yeah , it 's almost as if you 've ... controlled me completely . Beldar , I just don 't think I 'm ready for this test yet . I really don 't . I can 't- - Oh , listen to me . I 'm okay . I 'm just ... human , and I 'm ... weak . Gladys ! Look at me . Oh , yeah . I am your teacher . You are my student . It is natural that you harbor certain Feelings for your driving instructor . But , you must understand nothing can come of this . 58 US dollars , please . You are one of the finest men I have ever met . When my species comes to rule this planet , your name will be on the protected roles , and you will come to no harm . You are wise , but there 's a sadness to your wisdom . Ronnie , don 't . Please ? Come on , Connie . I 've told you how I feel about you , doesn 't that mean anything ? It means a lot . Well , it 's like , I pick you up , I take you out , I bring you home , we say good night , and you never kiss me . What is there , somethin wrong with me or somethin ' ? Of course not . It 's just ... my parental units ... well , we 've never been really affectionate , and ... I 'm afraid I don 't know how . It 's easy . All you do is lean forward and kiss , like this . Ronnie , don 't . Ronnie , I am not ready . Oh , you 're ready . Don 't . Ronnie ! Greetings . How was your date with Ronnie ? Daddy was right . Earth boys only care about one thing . You mean Ronnie was behaving like a flandap . Flandap ? Flandap- - an uninvited grasper of cone , a masher , a hustler . Flandap ? Hi , Mr. Conehead . - I find you unacceptable . - Yes , sir . If I did not fear incarceration , by human authority figures , I would terminate your life functions by applying sufficient pressure to your blunt skull so as to cause its collapse ! Th-Thank you . Do not worry about the flandap Ronnie . You will not see him within the Laurel Hills quadrant again . I cannot believe you did that . You 've ruined my life . Young one , when we return to Remulak ... I don 't care about Remulak . That stupid star cruiser is never coming anyway ! But she said ... I-I thought ... I will attend to the young one . Come in . You know Connie , I read in a magazine you can talk to me about anything . Mom ... what does it feel like to ... hone ? Well , for me , the first time , it happened so fast , I hardly knew I had honed at all . and after that , it was more repetition than anything else . Oh , my young one , your cone is changing , and you feel unsure . How would you know what it 's like ? You 've been married to Daddy for so long . I was a young cone myself once . Before I met Beldar , I was very attracted to a young Thorasian forger . and as far as I was concerned , there was no other life force in the universe that mattered . But then he got a job working at a volcano complex on some moon in the Bituminous Cluster I never saw him again . and it broke my blood valve chamber . I got over it , and it worked out for the best . Because , then I met your Father . And I knew then that I had found my true life mate . I love you , Mom . The currents of chromobonding between you and your parental units are infinite . Mib ! Good shot . So , have you given any thought to what I said about , you know ... hair ? I do not understand . Bel , it 's me , Larry . You don 't have to pretend it doesn 't bother ya . You 're a young man , my friend . No reason for you to be skinny up top . I 'll let you in on a little secret . Not all my own hair . Hard to tell , isn 't it ? Only from very high altitude . Well , I 'll say no more . Think it over . Meanwhile , I 'll be happy to introduce you to my man . - Thank you . - Hey , Mr. Conehead , way to blast out of the bunker , huh ? It 's me , Ronnie ! I hope you didn 't cut your hand when you tore open my car . I 'm fine . Yes , thank you . No problem . Good-bye . Okay Hey , chubby , come on . All right , Conehead , that puts me 4 behind you at the turn . Correct . Hey , Mr. Conehead , I 'm miserable . I feel so bad for what I did . It feels like somebody 's ripping my guts out . She won 't take my calls . Hey , kid , I 'm not paying you to yak . Buddy ? What 's with the head ? Forget him , he 's not a member . That concludes the 1-meter competition . Next will be the 3-meter board category The first diver for the home team , Connie Conehead . You 'll execute a 1-1 / 2 flip with a twist , and the head and body enter the water - with as little splash as possible . - All right . Good job . Keep it up . You 've got one more dive . Diving for Union High , Gail Jensen . You were great . I 'm sorry about the other night . I was a real jerk ! Okay ? Connie 's our best hope for state championship finals . Correct . We believe this also . You know , tell me if I 'm wrong , but I don 't think I ever seen you 2 at any of the parent meetings . What committees are you on ? You know , we still need volunteers for the homecoming gala . - Home ... - coming ? - Coming ... - home ? Let 's go Fight ! Let 's go Fight ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hi , look , I 'm sorry if I ... No , I mean , I shouldn 't have been so ... Hey , it was me . Sometimes , I just ... Me , too . Me , too . If I thought I did anything to ... Oh , no . You didn 't . I mean ... I mean it . Seriously ? Yeah . Wow . Glad we talked . And now , parents and students alike , if you will direct your attention to the sky above the playing field , You will be treated to a display of amateur fireworks courtesy of Beldar Conehead , Father of Paramus High 's own Connie Conehead . Careful there , Conehead . Pretty cheap , Conehead . Cigar ? Is the light keeping you awake ? No . Your breathing has become erratic . A torg for your thoughts ? Beldar , are you content with me ? Of course . Why would I not be ? Now , I would like to enter my slar phase . Let us suppose for some reason my life function ceased . What would you do ? I would incinerate your carcass in the tradition of Obedai the Obtuse , and put it in a clean dry place . Would you find a new genetomate to bring to our goz chamber and ... propagate ? Ah , my most precious one , I would collapse . I would draw the shades and I would live in the dark . I would never get out of my slarpad or clean my self . My fluids would coagulate , my cone would shrivel and I would die , miserable and lonely . The stench would be great . Oh , Beldar , you have made me very happy . Yes . I know . Good night . Life on Earth is good . I agree . Stability and contentment have been achieved . Lay by and put about ! Lay by and put about ! Attention ! Return to your port of embarkation . There is no work for you in the United States . You have no job skills . You will be a drag on our economy . We appreciate your situation , but we have problems of our own . Thank you . Phone , sir . Seedling here . Sir , a fax came through on the secure channel . I think we found him . Don 't toy with me , Eli . This time , it had better be real . Oh ! Oh , hello , Mrs. Conehead . I 've been meaning to talk to you about the Christmas tree lighting ceremony . We found someone else to head up that committee and won 't be needing Mr. Conehead 's services after all . So , if you could just thank him for me . He will be very disappointed . I 'm telling you , Bels , if you just stay on your game . you could win that trophy this year . A meaningless piece of metal and wood . I compete only with myself . I appreciate the game for its physics , its high level of skill , its self-control , and , of course , spirituality . You 're full of it , Conehead . The only reason you 're coming to the costume ball is ' cause you think you gotta shot at winning that trophy . Negative . Of course if I should win the trophy , I would accept it , with limited enthusiasm . Ron . Harv . Beldar , what 's happenin ' ? Hey , Conehead , what kinda costume are you wearing to the Halloween dance ? I am not about to tell you , Harv . Eh ? " Consume alco-beverage . Come get me ! " Ah ! Mai tai ! I will enjoy it . Greetings , earthman . Huh . Ah , hmm . Ah , huh- - It is good to hone in places other than our goz chamber before slar phase . Who said ? Good Housekeeping What are they doing in there ? Sounds like they stepped on a cat . Convec 3 . Awaiting Commissioner Seedling . Go ahead . Yes sir . We 're on him , sir . Don 't make a move without me . Roger , I understand . No . We won 't make a move until you get here . Greetings . Hello there . We just stopped by to introduce ourselves . We 're Jehovah 's Witnesses . How do you do . I am Beldar . We attend the Kingdom Hall on Coveneck Road . Ah yes , next to the dry cleaners across from 7-11 . - Exactly . May we ask you a question ? - Proceed . Do you agree that the world is headed towards a terrible calamity ? Most definitely . In fact , I have direct personal knowledge that this is so . Great , may we come in ? Of course . Enter . Assume comfort . My mate Prymaat . Greetings . Be seated . So , what do you know of the doom awaiting this planet ? Well , as ... as Witnesses , we believe that the end of the world is approaching and that only 144,000 people will be saved to rein . I do not believe it will be that many . Oh , no , the Bible clearly states 144,000 will be saved to rein . That is a very optimistic estimate considering the primitive weapons the Earth people will use for their defense . Some Earth weapons are not so useless . Mibs , drop it . Well , uh , when the time comes , no weapon of this earth shall avail mankind . - Correct . - Correct . Where are you people from ? France . We come from France . But we are American citizens now . Do you have proof ? Proof ? Well ... I 'm going over to Christina 's . She 's gonna give me a ride to the dance . - So , um ... I 'll see you there . - All right . I take it your daughter was born here . Yes . She is native to your pla- - uh , country . Scarle ma tibea meldow . Scarle ma tibea meldow .

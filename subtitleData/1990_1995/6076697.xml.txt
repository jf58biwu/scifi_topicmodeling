 [ instrumental music ] ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ theme music ] [ explosion ] [ crash ] [ instrumental music ] [ no audio ] Clark . Up here . [ music continues ] Where 's Mr. Jackson ? He 's in DC trying to fight what 's going on here . Well , what is going on here ? The bureau 's making some cutbacks and your position 's one of the ones that 's being eliminated . The good news is that we figured out a way to keep you onboard by promoting you to a GS-9 . Let me get this straight , my position 's being eliminated so they 're giving me a promotion ? It 's a government thing . Just go with it . It 'll mean more responsibility , more money .. ... and a free psychiatric evaluation . So , there 's nothing to worry about . Wait a minute . - A what ? - It 's no big deal . It 's just a formality , really . The higher your security level , the more they check you out . Here 's the address . There 's an examiner waiting to see you now . I don 't wanna go to a psychiatrist . Why not ? Everybody does these days . Heck , they put it on their resumes in Los Angeles . It 's not like it 's an obstacle course . You just lie there and answer some questions . As long as you got nothing to hide , there 's no problem . I just don 't like the idea of it . I mean , if there 's any way around this .. I don 't know what to tell you . You like your job here , right ? Of course I do . I-I love it . If you don 't go , I 'm afraid you won 't have one to love . [ instrumental music ] Like I said ... I 'd love to go . [ dramatic music ] Pretty boring stuff , huh ? There 's nothing really very special about me . - I 'm-I 'm just an ordinary guy . - Good . Then , you needn 't be so nervous . [ music continues ] You like puzzles ? [ clatters ] Puzzles are like people . It 's my job to ferret it out all the pieces .. ... and make sure they fit . - They look really hard . - Yes , they are . Please . Why don 't you lie down , Mr. Kent ? You and I are going to get better acquainted . Just relax . Think of me as someone to confide in . But I already have someone to confide in . As a matter of fact , I have two people . My parents . I can 't think of a better place to start . Why don 't you tell me about them ? Well , they 're two of the nicest people you 'll ever wanna meet . ( Clark ) I can tell them anything . Whenever I need advice I know where to go . I didn 't mean to upset you . But people do need you . Everywhere I go , somebody needs me . That 's because you are who you are . [ spoon clatters ] Who am I ? I didn 't ask to be like this . And I can 't help everybody . That 's why I had to turn off the news . I turn it on and hear about people in Canada stuck in an avalanche . Sure , I could fly up there in a few minutes and rescue them . While I 'm doing that , there are some firefighters in the North Sea on an oil rig , who are dying in a fire . Or a little girl 's fallen down a well . No one expects you to do it all . Don 't they ? Do you realize what it 's like ? There 's so much going on around you all the time and not be able to stop it all ? You always have to choose . They know more about me than anybody . So , what does that tell you ? About your parents ? That you had a loving , supportive family . Then I guess I must be normal . Well , John Hinckley had a loving , supportive family . It 's sounds to me like your parents are a substitute for close peer relationships . Do you have a social life ? Do you have a girlfriend ? No . Yeah , um .. ... kind of . Kind of ? Could you expand on that ? [ sizzling ] [ dramatic music ] Ah ! [ sizzling continues ] [ instrumental music ] [ crash ] Ah ! [ music continues ] But I have to leave early this afternoon . Adam 's taking me to the opening ceremonies for the centennial , tonight . But you were supposed to go with me . Oh , I 'm sorry , Clark . I forgot . But you understand . I mean , it 's a date . I understand . Well ... I guess , we 've had our ups and downs . There 's a part of me that she really likes .. ... maybe even loves . But there 's another part of me that ... she just likes as a friend . What are your feelings for her ? Well , I guess I love her . You guess ? I-I do love her . Have you ever told her ? No . Because I 'm not sure if ... being with me will be the best thing for her . And I would never want her hurt . Why would being involved with you cause her to be hurt ? [ sighs ] Didn 't your mother ever tell you to respect other people 's property ? I have something ... I think you 're gonna be interested in . Lana ! Now , if you wanna see her alive .. ... then come to my basement , downtown . Superboy , don 't do it . It 's a trap ! Of course , it 's a trap . He knows it . He 's gonna be there anyway . I mean , he 's a superhero . [ chuckles ] Come with me . And I will let them all live . You have to . [ crackling ] Innocent people will die . [ dramatic music ] Wait ! I 'll make it easy . [ instrumental music ] Let 's just say , part of me always puts my work first . Very interesting . Don 't you think you 'd be more comfortable lying down ? You keep referring to yourself in two parts . Almost as if you think of yourself as two different people . Would you say that 's accurate ? Do you see yourself as two people ? [ theme music ] Sometimes . But doesn 't everybody see themselves as somebody else at sometime or another ? Mr. Kent . From the moment you walked into my office you have been careful . Careful of my questions , careful of your answers . Even your body language is careful . And in my experience people who are careful are usually hiding something . What are you hiding ? Nothing . Really . I don 't believe you . But then again we 'll know soon enough . It is now time to move to our next ... examination . And what exactly is next ? The lie detector . [ dramatic music ] Okay . Comfy ? Good . And now we can get into the really interesting questions . Have you ever committed a crime ? Um , I thought I did once . What do you mean ? Did you ... ever commit a crime ? [ huffing ] [ crash ] [ explosion ] I 'm looking out my window and , uh , that black guy he must 've been scared 'cause he jumped in the car . The next thing , Superboy blows that truck right on top of him and-and the whole thing goes up in flames . The guy was screaming something awful . I didn 't hear anything . I thought for sure you were gonna save him . Well , it was one of those things , um .. Someone told me that I had done something wrong and I believed it . Again , did Superboy kill Winston ? - The bomb first . - No , man . Truth first . Then perhaps the bomb . The-the truck had already crashed and it was burning and Llewellyn hit Winston with a brick or something chucked him into the car and let him fry . ( male # 1 ) Superboy didn 't know squat what was happening . I found out later that it wasn 't really my fault . So then , no . You didn 't commit a crime ? Hm . No , I guess I didn 't . Okay , then you 've never been involved in any illegal activity . - Well , I didn 't say that . - What did you say ? Well , there was this other time . I almost did something very wrong . ( Clark ) I 'd been misled by this other person and .. [ echoing ] Superboy ! ( male # 2 ) Superboy ! [ echoing ] Superboy , can you hear me ? Now , just relax .. ... and do everything I tell you to . [ beeping ] It 's a time bomb . I want you to put it in the Premier 's hotel room . Set it so it detonates after you 're gone . Soviets will blame the Americans . The Americans will blame the Soviets . And it 'll be Armageddon at last . You have no choice , you must obey me . As long as I have the parchment you signed you must do whatever I say . [ crash ] [ glass shattering ] [ explosion ] Alright , okay . Let me put it another way . Have you ever willingly committed a crime ? Since you put it that way , no . Finally . Thank you . You see , you just have to learn to phrase your questions a little better . Alright . The next one 's easy . Have you ever willingly destroyed public or private property ? [ crash ] [ huffing ] [ crash ] [ glass shattering ] [ crash ] We all are good . [ sizzling ] [ zapping ] [ explosion ] Only in emergencies . [ lie detector beeping ] Fine . Next question . Have you ever lied to a co-worker or superior in anything work-related ? What precisely do you mean by lied ? This is a nightmare . Will you stop ? Will you just stop fidgeting ? Alright . Have you ever , have you ever knowingly deceived anyone ? Hank , those index cards you were asking for I 'm gonna go buy them now . [ theme music ] - Where have you been ? - Getting index cards . For 45 minutes ? I was shopping for a discount store . You told us to save government money . I left my wallet in the car . Um , I gotta put money in the parking meter . You better call the police . It 's ... Clark ! I know it 's lame , but I was sick- - Yeah , sick . You see , I try to be in bed by 10 and sometimes I have to rush . Matt 's with the body . I haven 't seen Clark . Then I got lost . So , where were you ? Or don 't you remember ? Oh , I remember . And I can give you all the explanations you want . But that 's not the real issue . No ? Then what is ? These re-creations are based upon your memories . When Superboy 's around you don 't notice me . You 're just trying to throw off suspicion . I always try to be honest , but ... sometimes I can 't . Sometimes I feel like I should hold back information for other people 's own good . Alright , the tough ones are out of the way . So , uh , on to the more mundane . Have you ever used an alias ? Clark , he was only an act , wasn 't he ? [ laughs ] Kent ! Superboy . I guess we can forget that faxing , huh ? Superboy ! No . Superboy . Superboy . I like the sound of that . [ indistinct chattering ] Superboy . What exactly do you mean , doctor ? I think the question is obvious . Have you ever used another name ? I said , are you known by any name other than Clark Kent ? [ buzzing ] Is something wrong ? I don 't know . I 've never seen it do this before . [ screams ] Geez . [ crackling ] - You have a fire extinguisher ? - Oh , yes , of course . [ huffing ] It went out by itself . That 's the first time that 's ever happened . Oh , here . - I guess that 's it , right ? - I guess so . I certainly have enough data . Let me just check to make sure that I 've ... covered everything . How did I do ? I 'm afraid that I 'm going to have to recommend that they defer putting through your promotion . What ? Why ? Because I don 't think you 've got what it takes to be GS-9 . - But- - - I 'm sorry . But that is my evaluation . [ dramatic music ] I 'm sorry , doctor , but I think you 've made a mistake . I 'm conscientious , honest , hard-working . And unlike some other government employees who are there just to pick up a paycheck I 'm there because I care . If you don 't think that I 'm an asset the government should keep I 'm prepared to file an appeal with your superior . I love my job . And I 'm ready to fight to keep it . - Very good . - I mean it . I know you do . And I 'm delighted to hear it . My reports from your superiors are that you are a good employee but that you 're usually meek and self-deprecating . I was just checking to see if they were right . So does that mean I passed ? My report will be at your office tomorrow . Oh , by the way .. ... it was very interesting . That it was , Mr. Kent . That it was . [ instrumental music ] Dr. Meyers seems to think you 're a pretty interesting guy , Clark . So , how did I do ? She said she 'd love to keep you on the couch for another year or so but that you 'd probably make a great ... GS-9 . - So I passed ? - Yeah , you passed . Congratulations . You just earned yourself an extra $ 12 a month . [ instrumental music ] [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

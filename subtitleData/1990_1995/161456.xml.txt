 Sir , we 've located the black box . You should get something now . Confirmed . Ident details - SSS Esperanto . Ocean seeding ship . Mission to introduce oceanic life to potential S-3 planets . This was a recon trip . A three-year check , strictly routine , to make sure the amino acids had taken . They 'd been trying some new technique to accelerate evolution . Topped even their best projections . They got five million years of evolution in three solar years . So what happened ? Final entry , routine stuff . They spent the day cataloguing and indexing new life forms . - Then it stops . - The question which occurs : all these new life forms , where are they all ? - What are you implying ? - No implication , sir . Yes , there is . You 're saying there 's some huge damn fish ? Some kind of gigantic pre-historic leviathan who 's porked its way through the ocean . - That 's one option . - Any alternatives ? - None that occur . - Hey , wait a minute . I 've got it . - Don 't fish swim south for the winter ? - No , that 's birds , sir . Birds swim south for the winter ? How do they breathe ? Guys . Rimmer , you getting this ? It looks like Norman Bates 's mum . Human , male , Caucasian . Cause of death - gunshot wound to the head . From the wounds , most likely self-inflicted . Here 's another one ! - Two suicides ? - There 's more ! Oh , male . Oriental . Clearly , he committed seppuku . Hey ! Look what I found . Species - unknown . Similar to Earth haddock . Cause of death - suffocation . What ? - What is it ? - This fish suffocated in water . It voluntarily closed its own gills . Are you saying this haddock committed suicide ? I 'm merely stating the known facts . This fish relinquished its life of its own free will . Damn fool ! Why would a haddock kill itself ? Why am I even asking that question ? Hang five , guys . I 'm getting something . He committed suicide , he committed suicide , he committed suicide and the fish committed suicide . There 's some kind of link here . Hang on a minute , guys . Check this . It 's an unknown compound . Best guess is some sort of hallucinogenic venom secreted by a piscine source , not unlike the Earth octopus or giant squid . - This is octopus ink ? - I 'm just completing a chemical analysis . - Oh . Er ... - What ? - Come on ! - What 's happening ? - We have to go ! - Kryten , what 's going on ? - Entering air lock . - Repressurising now . Some kind of sea creature , a life form never encountered before , attacked this ship . Its defence mechanism is curious . It secretes a venom , a poison , possibly even a hallucinogenic , which disfunctions its prey by inducing despair . That 's why the crew members and that fish committed suicide . Unfortunately , we have been contaminated . It 's a greatly reduced dose but we may experience moments ... . of despair and anguish . What about Lister and the Cat ? I 'm OK . I don 't seem to be affected . I don 't think anyone 's loved me in my entire life , but there 's nothing new about that . What 's gotten into you ? It 's like Saturday night at the Wailing Wall . Why is it always me that has to be strong ? You guys just fall apart . We should get back and take a mood stabiliser . I suggest lithium carbonate . I know this isn 't what you want to hear right now but there 's a blob on the scope the size of New Mexico and it 's heading your way . I think the Suicide Squid is about to make an appearance . - Where is it precisely ? - Right above you , 2,000 fathoms and diving . Oh , thanks , Rimmer . You know the state we 're in ! - You couldn 't have lied ? - I was lying . It 's only 1,000 fathoms . We 're entering Starbug 's airlock now . What 's it doing ? It 's trying to work out what we are . Cut the power . This venom , are we safe in here ? It penetrated the hull of a class D seeding ship . In comparison , we 're a sardine tin . - It 's moving . - Where ? - Down . - Speed ? - 15 knots ... 16 ... 18 ... - It 's diving . - Course ? - Collision . - Do we move or stay ? - 25 knots ... 35 ... 50 ... - It 's coming straight for us . - It thinks we 're a threat , food or a mate . It 's gonna kill us , eat us or hump us . We either persuade him that we 're not that kind of vessel or scarper pronto . Diddled by a giant squid on a first date ? OK , we 're going to try and outrun it . Holly , give me manual . Change bearing , one zero five . There 's some natural caverns . - It might give us some cover . - That 's a yo , Holly . New course set . - It 's hit us ! - Look out ! You have been engaged in the Total Immersion Video Game Red Dwarf . As with all role-playing adventures , you will experience a certain amount of disorientation on leaving the game . It will be several minutes before your real-life memories return . In the meantime , please disengage the game-playing machinery and relax until an attendant is free to answer your questions . On behalf of Leisure World International , may we say welcome back to reality . This is a very , very bad dream , right ? - I 'm not a hologram . - I 'm half human . What the hell 's happened to my teeth ? ! I can open beer bottles with my overbite . All right . How you feeling ? Bit wonky ? Perfectly normal . You 'll be as right as rain in 20 minutes . If you 'd move into the recuperation lounge , I 'll get things ready for the next lot . - Next lot ? - Yeah , very popular , Red Dwarf . It 's got a two-year waiting list on 20 machines . - So , how 'd you get killed , then ? - Some kind of squid . The Despair Squid ? That shouldn 't have killed you . Why didn 't you use the laser cannons ? Starbug doesn 't - didn 't - have laser cannon capability . You twonk ! You use the laser cannons on the crashed wotsit ... Esperanto . - That 's how you get out of it . - How could we know , you Brummie git ? Esperanto . That 's a clue , isn 't it ? Esperanto , hope . Hope defeats despair , the Despair Squid . It 's a blatant clue , isn 't it ? Blatant . You must have been playing like puddings ! Which one was playing Lister , then ? - Me . - Did you get Kochanski ? Was I supposed to ? Supposed to ? That 's the objective of the game for Lister , you twonk . You get separated to begin with . It 's a love story across time , space , death and reality . You must have got the easy stuff . What about the planet of the nymphomaniacs ? - The planet of the what ? ! - You missed that ? Oh ! That 's a riot . Some people spend years on that . Are you seriously telling me you were playing the prat version of Rimmer for four years ? Oh-ho ! That 's a classic , that is . That 's a classic . All right , lads . Which one 's Lister ? Right . Got your food bag , bio-feedback , catheter ... It 's all there . You can start plugging yourself in . Here , don 't confuse the food pipe with the catheter . Some bloke did , we didn 't spot it for two days . OK , Kryten . In you go , son . OK , Cat , Rimmer ... Give us some room here , chaps ? Well , where do we go ? Our memories haven 't returned yet . The re-cup-er-a-tion lounge . I keep telling you ! Blimey ! No wonder you only scored four per cent . Cor ! What a bunch of twonks . I 'm not Lister , then . I 'm not me , am I ? None of us are who we thought we were , sir . - I 'm not Rimmer , then ? - No . I 'm not a hologram . I 'm not Rimmer . Well , who the hell are we ? The kind of sad acts who spend four years playing a computer game . Either we 're running from God knows what or have nothing worth living for . - Is there a Duane Dibbley here ? - Pardon ? - Duane Dibbley ? - No , sorry . How do you know there 's no one called Duane Dibbley here ? It could be you . No , this is right . This is the Dibbley party . Which one 's Duane Dibbley ? No . No , no , please , no ! I don 't want to be Duane Dibbley . It 's you . Here are your party 's possessions . The medical officer will be down soon . Duane Dibbley ? How can I be Duane Dibbley ? It 's true . It 's got your photograph , name , address on it and everything . There 's an anorak in here ! White socks ... nylon shirt ... plastic sandals ... Aertex vest ... cardigan ... oh , and a key to the Salvation Army hostel . It doesn 't make sense . I 'm sorry , but I 'm afraid it makes perfect sense ... Duane ! Imagine a guy with no elan , no style - a misfit . Wouldn 't this hapless creature give his buck teeth to play the Cat in a computer game ? So this is really me ? A no-style gimbo with teeth the druids could use as a place of worship ? ! - All right , this one 's you . - Oh . Who am I ? Wow ! You 're a detective in the cybernautic division of the police department . Oh ... ha ... Golly . Really ? - Yeah . This is your badge . - A detective ? What 's my name ? Jake . Jake Bullet . Jake Bullet , cybernautic detective . I like that . Duane Dibbley ? So , whoever you are , who 's next ? - I don 't want to know . Someone else look . - Stand aside . Let the law handle this . Hmm ... No photograph . Name - Billy Doyle . Not necessarily . It 's not necessarily me . Billy Doyle . That 's a name from the wrong side of the tracks . It 's yours . - What ? - It 's yours ... Bill . - No . - Check the ugly mug on the ID , then , man . " William Doyle " . William Doyle . Good ol ' Bill Doyle . That sounds like a hell of a good name . Probably connected with the Boston Doyles . Old money , blue-chip stock . It 's all coming back to me now . What puzzles me is why a man of such good breeding would be wearing a coat that smells like an elderly yak has taken a leak in both pockets . - Well , isn 't it obvious ? - No , it isn 't . Oh , my God . My name is Billy Doyle and my cologne is Eau de Yak Urine . So who am I , then ? Wow ! Look at my gear ! This stuff 's really , really expensive . Are you sure this isn 't my box ? - Who are you ? What do you do ? - I work for some company - CGI . I 've got a limo in the long-term car park . Clearly , you were privy to all the breaks that life denied William Doyle . Sir , I think you should take a look at this . William , meet your brother Sebastian . Well , half-brothers . Uterinal - same mother . This is a crazy idea . We can 't leave now . Our memories haven 't returned yet . We 've got to find out more . I can 't be his alky , yak-coat-wearing half-brother . Duane Dibbley ? ! Are you crazy , Lister ? Are you totally nuts ? You risk everybody 's neck just to save my life ? - Do that again and I 'll kill you . - Hey , Kochanski . Shut up . " Vote Fascist for a third glorious decade of total law enforcement " ? ! " Be a government informer . Betray your family and friends " ? " Fabulous prizes to be won " ? ! Here it is . - This is your car ? - Bay 47 . Halt or I 'll fire ! Move , voters ! Move one inch and I 'll crush every bone in your body . You helped an enemy of democracy escape . She was stealing an apple of the people . - Bullet , cybernautics . - That 's traffic control . Kneel , voters . You are under sentence of death . Come out of the shadows , voter . What 's the beef ? Did she steal your lunch box ? Many apologies , Voter Colonel . Had I known it was you ... - Forgive me . - You know me ? Of course , Voter Colonel . - Who am I ? - You are Colonel Sebastian Doyle . Section chief of CGI . Head of the Ministry of Alteration . Remind me a little . What exactly do we do at the Ministry of Alteration ? You ... change people , Voter Colonel . - In what way ? - You change them from being alive people to being dead people , to purify democracy . - Purify ? - No one has done more to purge the ballot boxes than the Voter Colonel . - So why has he been away for four years ? - Voter Colonel , is this some sort of test ? Answer him . The rumour was that you had grown weary of your glorious duties and had gone away , in secret , to renew yourself . Halt ! I killed him . Lets get out of here ! In the car ! - Get in the car ! - I killed him ! We haven 't got time for that ! - I killed a human ! - In the car ! Look out ! Fascist cops ! They 're armed . You 're hit ! Hello . For the 3,000th time , you 're hallucinating . Can anyone hear me ? Uh-oh ! Speed bumps ! Chicane ! Look out . The barrier . Brace yourselves ! We 're going through it ! Motorcycles . They 're carrying personal rocket launchers . - That bridge , think we can make it ? - It 's raising ! - Got any better ideas ? - Just do it ! Whooooa ! We made it ! Nice driving ! So long , suckers ! Uh-oh ! Helicopters . Oh , I 'm going to have to dump the limo ! OK ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Down that alley ! I killed him . I killed a human . Damn . What are you doing ? ! It is fundamental that I never take a life . I could have stunned him . I must terminate myself . This is a nightmare . I 'm on the run with a murderer , a mass murderer and a man in a bri-nylon shirt . I 'm a human-wreckage sputum-bag who smells like a yak latrine . Now I 'm about to be splattered with an android 's brain . I 'm after you with the gun . - Yeah , count me in too . - Ditto . But there 's only one bullet left . We could put our heads together and the bullet could go down the line . Kryten , I 'm using a higher frequency . Can you hear me now ? - Did somebody say something ? - You 're hallucinating . Put the gun down . I think I 'm going to put the gun down . - Walk forward three paces . - I 'm going to walk forward three paces . Well , he 's cracking up . I 'm going to pick up this fire extinguisher and twist the release wheel . Have you quite finished being strange ? I 'm sorry , sir . I don 't know what came over me . - OK ? - OK . You 're hallucinating . You 're hallucinating . - What ? - You almost didn 't make it . - Welcome back . - What happened ? You had a group hallucination , brought on by the Despair Squid . You were about to commit suicide until the mood-stabiliser saved you . - The lithium carbonate . - We really would have killed ourselves ? Of course . The hallucinations were designed to induce despair . To attack the very things we each consider quintessential to our self-esteem . Take Mr Rimmer . He could no longer blame his failings on his parents , because he shared an upbringing with you , his richer , more important half-brother . Cat lost his cool , and life no longer had any meaning because he is so mind-meltingly shallow . Right . Superficial is my middle name . And you have always prided yourself on being a man of moral courage . So , when you thought you were a mass-murderer in a totalitarian state , despair . Despair destined to drive you over the edge . - And with you it was taking a human life . - Precisely . - I 'm not Duane Dibbley ? - No . I AM Rimmer ? I 'm afraid so . - What happened to the Despair Squid ? - I took care of that . Limpet mines . The fried calamari out there could feed Italy . - Let 's get out of here . - Flight coordinates programmed . Switching to pilot cooperation until we surface . Those planet engineers really screwed up in a big way here , didn 't they ? Playing God . The evolutionary process threw up a life form more deadly than any other species . Damn near wiped out everything on the planet . Spreading despair and destruction wherever it stuck its ugly mush . Hmm , sounds rather reminiscent of a species sitting not a million miles away from me now . You probably have to be a mechanoid to appreciate that one . Kryten , no one likes a smart alec android . Hit the retros . We 're on our way , sir .

 See you tomorrow , Beth . Okay . See you tomorrow . ... get some information about a crack house . This is some pretty direct information . It came from an informant who made a buy ... and , uh , like it when it 's that direct- - It 's easy to get a search warrant .. I 'm home . Hi . - Hi , Mom . - Hey . " Hey " ? All I get is " hey " ? Hey , Mom . I 'm gonna take a quick shower . - You guys interested in getting a pizza delivered ? - Mm . If that was a " yes , " you can call the order in . And no pepperoni for me . Hello . Oh . Yeah , sure . Ow . Tell Mom I 'll be back in five minutes , okay , butt crumb ? He said he was only going to be gone five minutes ... and that was over four hours ago . Yes . No , I don 't know who called him . The last person to see him ? His younger brother . ... what 's your ten-three ? Over . - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Hmm ? Gary ? Gary Kane ? Go get him a blanket . It 's gonna be okay , son . Hey , we 're here to help you . Hey . What 's wrong ? Oh , my God . Gary Kane . Sixteen years old . High school junior . " C " student , first-string varsity football , a member of the local Four-H Club . Not one of Wisconsin 's more remarkable kids , but still the apple of his mother 's eye . - What does that mean ? - Nobody knows . What does the police report say ? The victim received a phone call and left his home . He was discovered in the woods in his underwear 12 hours later . He 's been unable to give a coherent statement . - Any evidence of sexual assault ? - No . Does it seem like it might have been a schoolboy prank ? The other victims have had to be sedated and hospitalized ... since their ordeals . They were reportedly hysterical with fear . Victims ? You mean there have been others ? One in eastern Wisconsin , one three towns away . Both with the same words written in black Magic Marker . What 's your interest in this ? The local sheriff in Delta Glen , Wisconsin , thinks he knows what 's been happening to these kids . What 's that ? He thinks they 've been possessed . There 's something I think you ought to see first . They call themselves the Church of the Red Museum . They 're followers of a guy named Odin ... that moved out here from California three years ago ... - and bought a ranch . - What 's the significance of the name " Red Museum " ? Well , Odin and the rest of them are a bunch of vegetarians . They drove the ranch right into the ground- - Turned 500 head of beef cattle into pets . Calls it a " monument to barbarism . " Probably went over big with the local ranchers . Well , you got to admit it takes some big ones ... to set down in the middle of cow country and start a church like his . They kind of stick out like a sore thumb , don 't they ? You know , Sheriff , from what little we 've seen and what you 've told us , they seem rather unlikely to be involved ... in the kind of activities you described . Well , I won 't say another word . You can just see for yourself . Om . That 's Odin . " Today is a blessing from our Lord and Master ... who awaits his flock in this time , the dawning of the Age of Aquarius , eighteen Earth years from the beginning ... of the New Kingdom . The Guides speak through me today as messengers of the Word , that we may be free from death ... and the passage into spirit . As the acceleration continues , we , the enlightened , must bring the teachings ... of the skills for survival to mankind . - They 're walk-ins . - Repeat in prayer- - - What are " walk-ins " ? - We , - Uh . - the second souls of the first bodies , " We , the second souls of the first bodies , bearers of the Word and keepers of the sacraments ... of a new enlightenment . Believers in soul transference . Enlightened spirits who have taken possession of other people 's bodies . Blessed mission and toil . Our struggle is transcendent , and your guidance , our guides , Our struggle is transcendent ... and your guidance , our guides ... will carry us toward the dawning of a new age . will carry us toward the dawning of a new age . Today we bear witness ... to three who do not believe . We encourage them ... to open their hearts and minds ... to our teachings- - that they who slaughter the flesh ... slaughter their own souls ... and must be taught the way . " I only remember parts of it . Which parts are those ? I was in the woods and ... I felt ... a spirit enter me . When you say " spirit , " Gary , I 'm not sure what you mean . It- - It might have been an animal spirit . I can 't explain it . Something ... just came over me . And you don 't remember who called you ? Anything at all about what happened ... immediately after you left home that night ? Have you everhad any dealings with anyone from the Church of the Red Museum ? I see them around . Do you have any reason to believe that they may have been involved ... in what happened to you ? Now , tell him what you told me , Gary . - Hi . - Hi . - Who are you ? - Stevie . Oh , you 're in all the pictures . You must be Gary 's younger brother . I 'm Dana . Stevie , do you remember who your brother ... might have gone out to see the other night ? Did he say anything ? Scully , we 'll meet you outside . - Has this boy ever been in any trouble ? - Gary ? - Yeah . - No . I 've known him since he was a kid . He 's the same age as my son . He 's done some beer drinking , but he 's just your basic 16 year old . At least , he was . - Do you see a notable difference in him ? - Yeah , yeah . Gary Kane lived for football . He 's a damn good athlete too . Now he won 't even suit up . The Red Museum , how are they treated by the local citizens ? Nobody much cares for them . But are they ever singled out ? Shop owners refusing to sell to them ? - Stuff like that ? - Well , there 's a reasonable amount of tension , but most folks are happy to just try to avoid them . Uh , can you recommend a good motel in the area ? Sure . You 're going to stay ? You think there might be something to this ? I want to run a background check on the Church and this guy , Odin . If you could just show us a good motel and a good place to eat . You 've come to the right place for that . You know , Mulder , with ribs like these , I 'd say that the Church of the Red Museum ... has it 's work cut out for it . Thanks . So . You started to tell me about walk-ins , but I 'm not sure if I grasp the finer points . Uh , it 's kind of a New Age religion based on an old idea- - that if you , uh , lose hope or despair ... and want to leave this mortal coil , you become open and vulnerable . To inhabitation by a new spirit . A new , enlightened spirit . According to the literature , Abe Lincoln was a walk-in , and Mikhail Gorbachev , and Charles Colson , Nixon 's advisor . - But not Nixon ? - No . Not even they want to claim Nixon . Oh . So are you still subscribing to the sheriffs claims of a possession ? I don 't know . In the absence of any other plausible explanation , it 's a novel theory . Well , I 'll tell you something . I got the creeps in that apartment today . - Really ? - Towelhead . Yeah . Why ? What 's going on ? Turn around , man . Hey , veggie burger , who let you out ? The spur posse just rode into town . Hey , diaper head . We 're talking to you , man . - How 's your pet cow ? - Did you get any milk out of him ? We 're talking to you , Aladdin . What 's the matter diaper head , huh ? - Huh ? - Nothing . Hey , leave him alone . Leave him alone . Go home . Go ahead . Go home . Catch you later , Red . - You got a problem ? - Yeah . Who asked you ? - I see four against one , I got a problem . - Mulder . Yeah , well . Why don 't you run along with the little wife ? - You 're gonna miss the tour bus . - She 's got a gun . Well , what 's she gonna do ? Shoot us ? Go call my dad , Katie . I think he 'd like to hear about this . - Who 's your dad ? - He 's the sheriff . Yeah , I think he would like to hear about this . Come on . Let 's just get out of here , Rick . Kind of hard to tell the villains without a score card . ~ And everything she said ~ ~ Count every time she pushed me ~ ~ And left me with the dead ~ Pupper Dog ? Is that you ? Pupper Dog . What are you doing here ? Huh , girl ? Get off me ! Get off me ! Help me ! Please , somebody help me ! Help me ! Please ! Yeah , Danny , this is all good stuff . Yeah . See what else you can find on him from the N.C.I.C ... and call me back at this number or on my cellular . I just examined the girl . What did you find ? Not much until the toxicology report came back . They found trace amounts of an unspecified alkaloid substance in her blood- - possibly an opiate derivative- - as well as a dangerously large quantity of something called scopolamine . Is that the stuff they use for motion sickness ? Only in very small dosages . Anything past .2 micrograms ... and you 've got a very powerful anaesthetic with hallucinogenic qualities . It 's been in the news lately because Columbian gangs ... have been using it in kidnappings to subdue their victims . - Is it a controlled substance ? - Yes . You probably have to be a doctor or a pharmacist to get ahold of these quantities . " Richard Odin , also known as Doug Herman , left A.M.A. in 1986 over questionable-ethics inquiry . Did not renew license . " I 'll drive . I 'm Special Agent Fox Mulder . We 're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . We 'd like to speak to Richard Odin . - Is he in ? - Just a moment . - Mr. Odin . - Yes . We 'd like to ask you some questions . May we come inside ? I 'm sorry . I can 't allow you in this house . We can get a warrant , if that 's what it takes . You can ... get a warrant , if you 'd like , but you will not enter this building . Well , how 's that ? Because you 're meat eaters . And the buildings , our houses and our kitchens cannot be desecrated by your presence . I believe I am well within my religious rights to prevent it . Yes . But you can 't hide behind your rights if a crime has been committed . Have I been accused of a crime ? We can always determine that elsewhere . Can you step outside , please , sir ? Can you step outside , Mr. Odin ? We 're placing you under arrest . Are you familiar with a substance called scopolamine , Mr. Odin ? Are you familiar with bovine growth hormones ... and the inhumane treatment of beef and dairy cattle- - just answer the question , Mr. Odin . Yes , I know it . But I 've never prescribed it or administered it . Have you ever ordered others to do so ? No . Do your religious beliefs preclude you from exacting revenge , either physically or psychically , on those who might not share them ? The barbarians will one day be cleansed from the Earth . Answer the question . You did it , didn 't you ? You did something to those kids . Sheriff , I 've already had to go through this once with your kid . If you 'll just take a walk- - Hey , Sheriff . Could you come here for a minute ? You know , for a holy man , you 've got quite a knack for pissing people off . We 've got problems down the street . Keep your minds open to the wisdom of the Guides . - We don 't care about the wisdom of the Guides . - All we ask is that you listen . All right , man . Let 's do it . End the slaughter . The rights of the just must be protected . Just as the barbarism must cease . Violence against nature begets violence against man . How about a little cow blood ? What do you think you 're doing ? Get out of here . Get ! Get ! - They got what they deserved . - They asked for it . - You the F.B.I. agents ? - Yes . I have something I 'd like to show you . This pasture land ... belonged to my granddad . He bought it in 1890 . He died right over there , next to that cattle pen . Eighty two years old . just fell off the tractor one morning . My dad worked this piece for the next 40 years . And I put in 25 myself before I decided to call it quits . Sold it for 80 times what my granddad paid . - Why did you sell it ? - Business changed . People changed too . - In what way ? - Competition . Used to get by with 50 milk cows . Now you gotta have 500 . Used to turn them out to pasture . Now you keep them in pens and grain-feed them . You said you wanted to show us something . You 're looking at it . See those men over there ? Well , they 're injecting the cattle with something called B.S.T. Bovine Somatotropin . A genetically engineered growth hormone . Yeah . Shoot them up and a cow will produce ... ten percent more milk . Feed it to beef cattle , and more meat on the hoof . Changed the business . Changed a whole lot of things . How do you mean ? Well , that , uh , fracas in town this afternoon- - ten , even five years ago never would have happened . People around here have changed . You know , gotten mean , spiteful . Dog eat dog . We had seven rapes here last year- - by high school boys . Well , that , uh- - This business of the kids being found in the woods . Well , I think that you 're going to find it all comes from the same root source . The growth hormone ? Yes , sir . But those hormones have been proven safe . They 've been cleared by the F.D.A. Says who ? The government ? God . I don 't know , Doc . I 'm losing oil pressure like crazy . I don 't know what 's going on . How far are we from the airport ? We 're not going to make it . I 'm gonna have to find some place to put it down . Look out ! We 're still trying to I.D. the pilot . What about the second body ? That 's Dr. Jerald Larson . - Did you know him ? - Yeah . He delivered my kid . There 's something else over here I want you to see . Thank you . Looks like the doctor may have been delivering more than babies . That 's why I brought you out here . Any clue what this is about ? I have no idea . jerry Larson was a pillar in this community . He was the last of the country doctors . Well , wherever he was coming from , I 'd say that was one hell of a house call . You don 't think this has anything to do with what happened to those kids ? I think we 'll know more once we find out what this is . You 're sure ? Both kids ? No , that 's okay . I 'm sure you 're correct . Thank you very much . Scully . You 're not gonna believe this . You found a connection between the out-of-town kids and the kids abducted here- - Every one of them was delivered and treated through childhood by Dr. Larson . Yeah , the printouts we found in the briefcase were mostly shipping orders ... along with a list of credit card numbers , each number corresponding to a card in the victim 's family . Why would he carry a list of credit card numbers ? I don 't know . Maybe to track them ... the way credit card companies track stolen cards . But why ? And what was he treating them for ? What was he treating them with ? I don 't know . We won 't get the test results back on the vial until tomorrow . Are you thinking it might be bovine growth hormone ? I know that was the first thing through both of our minds , but it just doesn 't track . Not with that briefcase full of cash . I know and it still doesn 't answer the question about who 's marking those kids . Or why . Away . So , I 'll see you in the morning . Yeah , 8 : 30 sharp . Howdy . Hi . Sorry to come unannounced . Gary 's not home right now . Actually , we wanted to talk with you , if that 's okay . I don 't know what to say . You think Dr. Larson was doing some kind of tests on Gary ? Well , thinking back , is there anything that seems strange to you ? Was Gary sick often ? No . Actually , Gary 's never been sick a day in his life . Gary was never sick ? No . Why was he going to Dr. Larson ? Dr. Larson gave him vitamin shots . He gave them to a lot of kids . He said it was like treating their teeth with fuoride ... as a preventative measure . Did you ever take Gary to another doctor ? No . Jay had wanted to . Jay is your husband ? Yes . He was concerned Gary wasn 't growing . Jay was 6 ' 5 " . He wanted Gary to play collegeball . - But then there was Jay 's accident . - What accident ? It was seven years ago . He worked at the packing plant . He had an accident with one of the machines . Excuse me . What is this ? What ? This light here . I don 't know . There 's something back there . What is it , Mulder ? Looks like somebody 's private little movie studio . What ? Oh , my God . Gotta drain the lizard . What do you want , applause , man ? Rick ? Rick ? Sheriff , we 're gonna find who did this . Get away from him . Get back . Oh , my God . Ricky . Rick , son . No . No . No ! His name is Gerd Thomas . He 's owned the building for 21 years . He used to run a day care center out of it . They 're holding him for us . What is it ? - I know that face . - What ? That 's quite a video library you 've compiled for yourself . I especially like the ones with the little boys . I know . - I 'm a sick man . - No . No . Men who know they 're sick try to get help . You just kept right at it for years . I didn 't mean to hurt anyone . Did you kidnap those kids ? Yes . Are you prepared to confess to those crimes ? Yes . - And to the murder of Rick Mazeroski and- - - No . I never murdered anybody . Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski ? Did you write this on his back ? - Oh , my God . - Answer the question . No , I- - I never killed him . I never killed anybody . I- - I really loved those kids . Is this how you express your love for them ? Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski ? - Did you write that on his back ? - Yes . - Why ? - Because of what he had become . What had he become ? Because those kids have become monsters . That 's what . You 're not making any sense . Now , make sense to me . Because of Dr. Larson and because of the tests . Excuse me . Okay , what tests ? Dr. Larson was using those kids as guinea pigs . - And he was using us too . - What do you mean , using you ? To inoculate the cattle . With growth hormones ? I don 't know exactly what it was , but he was paying us a lot of money to do it . So , you 're saying that Dr. Larson was paying you a lot of money ... to inject the cattle with something , and you didn 't know what it was . Not until later . Not until after all those rapes and- - Dr. Larson told my boss that he felt responsible ... for everything that those kids had done ... and that he was giving them the same inoculations . Was Dr. Larson involved in the kidnappings ? No . No . No . He didn 't want his secret to come out . He didn 't care about those kids , like me . - Mulder . - Uh-huh . You know , I think he 's telling the truth . I don 't think he killed anyone . - How can you be sure ? - I just got the toxicology report back on the broken vial . The residual substance couldn 't be analyzed ... because it contained synthetic corticosteroids ... with unidentified amino acids . That 's purity control , Mulder . Do you know what you 're saying , Scully ? The man who died in that plane crash was inoculating those kids ... with antibodies derived from what may have been an extraterrestrial source . He 's been injecting those kids with alien DNA . No , Mulder . That was never proven conclusively . But it 's the same substance we found in the Erlenmeyer flask , isn 't it ? The same material my Deep Throat contact died for . - Yes . - Well , it all makes sense . The money in the briefcase . They 've been conducting an experiment here . Somebody 's been paying ... to have those kids injected with alien DNA to see how they 'd react . - It 's been going on for years . - Does that man know anything about it ? No . He 's just some poor soul who blew their cover . I don 't think he knows any more than he 's telling us . I think his boss must have because they just found him shot to death in a cow pasture . What ? I think I know who shot him , Mulder . That man that I recognized on the road today , that 's the same man that executed Deep Throat . Well , whoever 's behind this , he 's here covering their tracks . He 's gonna go after the kids . You get the sheriff ... and meet me at Gary Kane 's apartment . And Scully , I want this guy alive . - Where 's Gary ? - He 's in his bedroom . Go pack some clothes , things you 'll need . You 're all coming with me . - What ? - I 'll explain later . Those credit card numbers- - every kid 's family that was listed , get them packed up . Call out every man you 've got . Where are we taking them ? - Yes . - I need your help . For ? It may offend your religious sensibilities , but it could help save some kids ' lives . Sheriff . Where 's Mulder ? He told me to make sure that the kids were safe . He thought there was some other place this guy might be . Stop right there ! Hey ! Don 't move ! Put it down . Now . Just put the lighter down . Hey . Get him out of here . Get everyone out of here . Come on . File number X.W.C. 060361 . The identity of the man shot in the slaughterhouse has yet to be determined . His name , any record or artifact of his past , present or immigration status ... have yet to be found . His finger prints are not on file in either the F.B.I. or national system of records . At this time , it remains doubtful ... that anyone will come forward to I.D. or claim the body . Under further analysis , the inoculant found in the broken vials ... was isolated and determined to be an unstable antibody ... of no known biological origin . After three weeks of study , the components of the serum- - probably synthetic- - have broken down structurally and , in this retrograde state , can not be analyzed further . This coincides with the development ... of a severe and undiagnosed flu-like ailment ... affecting the children who were believed to have been inoculated ... and some of the local families . To date , none of the congregants or members of the Church of the Red Museum ... have contracted this illness . I suspect whoever was doing this may have been using them as a control group . The shipping manifests for what is believed to be ... milk and beef tainted by the unspecified inoculant ... did not provide enough information to track their destinations . A local advisory and quarantine have been established . Further inquiry into the tainted beef has been promised ... by the pertinent government health agencies . The F.B.I. investigation into this case is currently at a standstill .

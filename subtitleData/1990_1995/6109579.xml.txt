Get me a lawyer . - Where is the king ? - In the Great Hall , Sire . - Enough . Thy post . - Aye , Sire . To the Great Hall . ( TV static ) ( Whimpers ) ( dog growls ) I can 't breathe ! No , no ! Not again ! ( screams ) ( screaming ) - ( man ) Been thinking about what to do . - ( woman ) It 's him . Gotta change . Gotta change . Gotta be soon . Hello , Duane . Nice to see you . Nice to see you too , Doc . - How are you feeling today ? - Pretty good . Why don 't we sit down , Duane ? - I wanna go over a few things with you . - OK . Now , uh ... it says here that you 've been refusing to take your medicine . - I don 't like the way it makes me feel . - OK . All right . Let 's talk about that . Because we give you that medicine for a reason , Duane . - Because of your behaviour . - I know . I know . Because we don 't want you to hurt anybody again . Are you still hearing voices ? I 'm not crazy , Doc . Duane Barry 's not like these other guys . No , everybody here is different . They 're coming again . They 're coming again . I can feel it . They 're gonna take Duane Barry to the place . Nobody 's coming , Duane . Nobody can stop ' em . I 'm gonna give you a shot . I think you just need some rest . This 'll make you sleep . And when you wake up , you 'll see we didn 't let anybody hurt you . OK , Duane ? Duane ? Duane ! Get away . Get away . - Put down the gun , Duane . - Gimme the keys . - Duane . - Gimme the damn keys ! ( alarm ) No ! No ! Either way , Doc , we 're getting outta here together . You got it ? Let 's go , now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Agent Mulder . Krycek . What 's up ? There 's a situation going down . They want you right away . What kind of situation ? A hostage negotiation . - And they want me ? - Yeah . - What for ? - The guy escaped a mental institution . He 's got four people at gunpoint in an office . Claims he 's being controlled by aliens . - Krycek , Mulder . Where 's the commander ? - Right that way , sir . - OK , I got it right here . - Lucy . ( man ) You can put people on the third and fourth floor . - Agent Mulder ? - Yeah . Lucy Kazdin , negotiation commander . - This is Agent Krycek . - Let me show you what we 've got . His name 's Duane Barry . He 's armed with a 9mm Smith Wesson handgun one 9-round magazine . We believe that he 's prepared to use the gun and not afraid to die . - What does he want ? - Safe passage for him and his hostage ... - .. a shrink named Hakkie . - Passage to where ? He 's bent on taking the doctor to an alien-abduction site . He can 't quite remember where the site is , so he stopped at a travel agency . - Is he lucid ? - Yes , but off his medication , so he 's manic . Ranting about scoop marks , scars on his body , homing devices and other nonsense . Like what ? This alien-abduction business , which I guess you know about . Yeah , but I 've never been in a hostage negotiation before . We 'll take you through it . Agent Rich is advisory commander . - He and I will be coaching you . - What Mr Barry needs is a friend . Someone who appears to understand him and can appeal to his sense of reason . Do we know anything about his abduction experiences ? You really believe in this stuff , Agent Mulder ? Is that a problem ? We 're here to save lives . You 'll begin negotiations immediately . Every three hours we 'll re-evaluate your progress and let our tactical commander advise and update on the use of force . If this man is an abductee , I need to know more about him . His personal history . Each abduction case is different . That material 's not been made available to us . Nobody 's thought to call the hospital for records ? Look , Agent Mulder , the guy 's a psycho . Your object is to keep him on the phone . The longer you do , the more chance he 's not gonna kill anybody . We stop to do a Freudian analysis , next thing we know we 've got four dead hostages . So , whatever crap you gotta make up about spacemen or UFOs just keep him on the phone . Are we gonna have to sit on the floor like this all night ? I told you to shut up ! We all have families , for God 's sake . Duane , don 't hurt anyone . - Please ? - I 'm not gonna hurt you , Doc . Because this time you 're going with Duane Barry . So you can see what it 's like . That it 's real ! ( Phone ) - Duane ? - Yeah . This is Special Agent Fox Mulder . - Look , I wanna try to help you . - Yeah ? Well ... we 're just sitting here waiting for , uh ... travel plans . I think I know what you 're going through , Duane . I just wanna make sure you get what you want and that Bob Kimberly , Gwen and Dr Hakkie don 't get hurt . You know what I 'm going through ? You think you know what Duane Barry 's going through ? ! You don 't know jack ! I know you 're scared , Duane . And that you 'd like to see this all come out right . Yeah , right . So they can put me back in the outhouse ... where I belong . We 're only concerned about your safety , Duane . You and the others . Hey , what 's your name ? Mul-dore ? I know the routine . Honesty , containment , " ... conciliation . Am I missing something ? You need someone to trust , Duane . I know a lot of people who 've been through similar experiences . You wanna do something for me , Agent Mulder ? You keep your dogs on a leash . You try to gas me out or do anything stupid , these people die . They 're not taking me again . You got it ? They can take somebody else ! - Nobody 's gonna try anything , Duane . - ( hangs up ) Who is this guy ? He 's FBI , isn 't he ? - Former FBI . - And you didn 't think to mention that ? He 's been institutionalised on and off for over a decade . It 's beside the point . The point being that the Bureau wants to minimise its embarrassment . That we can police our own . They would like it done as neatly and cleanly as possible . - Well , you 're off to a hell of a start . - Negotiation is a process , Agent Mulder . If you just wanted somebody to read the script , you didn 't need me . This method has proven successful in winning the hostage-taker 's trust . No . That man is afraid , and the only way you 're gonna win his trust is by trying to understand what he 's afraid of . Have you ever spoken to an abductee , Agent Kazdin ? Heard them talk about having their brains sucked out through their nostril ? - Wanna know what they do to your ovaries ? - Not particularly . Well , then , understand that you might have to alter your approach a little bit here . Is there anything I can do ? - Yeah . What 's your name again ? - Krycek . - Krycek . Have you got your notepad ? - Yeah . Grande , two per cent cappuccino with vanilla . Agent Rich ? As you can see , the SWAT team has taken positions on all the surrounding buildings ... - Scully . - It 's me . I 'm in Virginia . I know . I 've been watching it on TV . What 's going on ? What 's the media saying ? An escaped mental patient is holding people hostage in a travel agency . What they 're not telling is he 's former FBI who claims to be an alien abductee . - Seriously ? - His name 's Duane Barry . I need your help . Find out what happened to him . Transcripts from therapy sessions hypnotic regressions , anything about his abduction . - Mulder ? - The lights just went out here . - ( man ) We 're losing power . - What the hell is goin ' on ? ( woman screams ) - Tactical Unit , what are you guys up to ? - Absolutely nothing , sir . What them ? - ( gunshot ) - Get down ! Everybody get down ! Tactical Command , shots have been fired . Locate and report . ( gunshots ) Negative . I 've lost communication . Waiting for orders , sir . - We 've lost our captured line . - We have either four or five shots fired . - What 's the number in there ? - 555 2804 . We have either four or five shots fired . An electrical substation blew . We 've got no power . - Duane ? - I told you . - Is everyone all right , Duane ? - You didn 't behave me . No , I believe you . I just need to know if anybody 's been shot . I need towels . Kimberly ? Kimberly ? He 's going to bleed to death . I guess we 're gonna need a doctor . You 'll have almost full ambient hearing loss and your sense of balance may be affected ... " particularly if you have to move quickly or get into a physical situation . If you get trapped or held in the building we 'll be able to warn you if there 's a tactical assault . And remember , he 's either got four or five rounds left . There 's a wireless mike in the top of this flak jacket . Speaking in a normal voice , we should hear anything you say up to a hundred yards . Attempt to keep these devices concealed . If you put a telephone to that ear , it 'll reveal that you 're wired . - You really wanna do this ? - Yeah . Your job will be to deliver medical help to the hostage . Anything else is a bonus . Get in and get out . You are not to risk your own life . And whatever you believe ... Don 't jump into his delusion . I can 't negotiate if he thinks I believe him . Right . This is Agent Janus . He 's attained medic . He 'll work on the hostage . You 're to keep Duane Barry talking . Like I said , if he 's talking , he 's not gonna shoot anybody - including you . I 've got three snipers out there . Anything you can do to get him to the door ... All we need is one shot to the medulla oblongata . Tact Command , this is rooftop zero two . I have them in sight . They 're passing the fountain and approaching the from entrance now . ( Duane Barry ) Just unlock the door . Move back . - Duane ? - Hands in the air . - Put the kit on the floor slowly . - We 're unarmed . - We just wanna help the injured . - ( woman ) Over here . Face the door ! That 's right . Not armed , huh ? You 're FBI , aren 't you ? - Got a gun in the kit ? - No . - Are you wearing a wire ? - No . We 're just here to help . OK . - Nobody 's gonna try anything , Duane . - That 's right . You wanna work with him . We just wanna make sure no one else gets hurt . Just do your business and get out . - How 's he doin ' ? - He 's bad . Hi , my name is Janus . I 'm a paramedic . Hold on . We 're gonna take care of you , OK ? They wanna work with you , Duane . But you gotta work with them . - Why not let the others go ? - Doc 's going with me . Then let the women go . Were they here , Duane ? The light . Was that them ? - Don 't try and BS Duane Barry . - We lost time . I checked my watch . Isn 't that what happens ? Time stops ? Isn 't it ? Duane ? ( screams ) ( screaming ) - You 're making it up . - Isn 't that what they 've been saying to you ? - That you 're making it up ? - They say it 's all inside my head . - All they wanna do is give me more drugs . - I hear you , Duane . - You hear me cos I got a gun . - No , I believe your story . No , you 're feeding into his psychosis . I know you 're afraid . I know the pain and the fear you must feel . Just listen to me . Don 't try and identify with him . I 've talked to people , Duane . People just like you who nobody wanted to believe . This man 's gonna die unless we get him to a hospital . Why don 't you let him go , Duane ? There 's no reason this man has to die . Come on , Duane . You 've got the power . Let him go . OK . Good . You made the right choice . Now , we 're just gonna move him carefully to the door . No ! Baldie can go . But you stay . I 'm trading the bald man for you . Dammit ! They 're coming out . Get him . You 're gonna be all right , sir . Keep moving . Now let 's see how good a liar you are . I 'm telling the truth , Duane . How could you ever know what Duane Barry 's been through ? How could anyone know ? It happened to my sister . Don 't you think you can lie to save their lives . I want some honesty ! I want some respect ! I 'm tired of all the BS ! How does it happen , Duane ? Driving in your car ? Alone in bed at night ? When do they come to you ? You 're paralysed , aren 't you ? Unable to move . Sometimes you can 't even breathe . You feel an electric shock and then they 're there . He 's gonna push him right over the edge . I need a clear picture of what 's going on in there . Right away . You 're choosing a dangerous course , Agent Mulder . There are beings , aren 't there , Duane ? Are they tall ? Or small ? - No ! - Diminutive ? They take you , Duane , against your will . - He 's gonna kill us . - You 're powerless . Sometimes you can 't even speak . It 's always the same . Nobody can help you . Where do they take you , Duane ? Is there a ship ? Do they take you to a ship , Duane ? How do you get there ? Are you conscious of being transported ? ( Duane Barry ) They 're , uh ... They 're talking to Duane Barry , " ... " but they don ' ! speak . He can hear what they 're saying . They can ... read his mind . That 's right . Abductees call it " mindscan " . It 's a kind of telepathy . I 'm telling ' em I don 't wanna go but they never listen . They know what I 'm sayin ' . But they just go right on about their business . Tell him what their business is . Tell him . They take you aboard the ship to perform the tests . They ... drilled my teeth . They drilled holes in my damn teeth ! ( Whimpers ) ( whirring ) ( screaming ) ( Phone ) Yeah ? Who here can talk to an Agent Scully ? Agent Scully , it 's Alex Krycek . - Where 's Mulder ? - He traded himself for one of the hostages . - What ? - He 's in with Duane Barry . - Get him out of there . - They 're working on it . No , get him out of there now or he 's gonna be killed . - How can you be sure ? - Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is . How old was your sister when they took her ? She was eight . I 've seen kids sometimes . Young girls . What are they doing to them ? Doing tests . You know ... " testing ' em . They tell ' em not to cry . Are they hurting them ? Oh , yeah . Sometimes , " " sometimes it hurts real bad and , uh you just wanna die , you know ? You know what 's it 's like , sir ? It 's like living with a gun to your head ... and never knowing when it 's gonna go off . You can let the others go , Duane . Let the others go and take me . Oh . They heard you talking like that , they 're gonna have your ass . I don 't care about that , Duane . No . I wouldn 't do that to you . Besides , Doc and I got an appointment . Ain 't that right , Doc ? We got a picture . Mulder is here , opposite the doctor . The women are on the north wall . We can 't see the east wall . Barry must be there . - Hold on a second . - No . I don 't think you understand . - I just flew down from ... - We 've got a situation ... - Let me talk to someone in charge . - Calm down , Scully . I 'm not gonna calm down until I can talk to someone who will listen to what I 'm saying ! What 's the problem here ? I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully and I have information that is vital to your negotiations . - What information ? - I think there has been a misjudgment here . This man who claims to be under the control of aliens his mental health history describes a rare state of psychosis . As you see from his medical records , in 1982 Duane Barry was shot in the line of duty the bullet piercing his bilateral frontal lobes . The injury left him nearly incapable of functioning in society . It effectively destroyed the moral centre of his brain . Almost a hundred years ago there was a famous case . A man named Gage had a blasting rod pierce the same region . And what effect did it have ? He became a pathological liar , suffering from severe delusions . His behaviour was characterised as bizarre and violent with a tendency to act out his fantasies . How did you get involved in this case ? Agent Mulder called me . We used to work together . Well , if this is true , he 's got your former partner completely fooled . Is there away I can reach him with this information ? The government knows about it , you know . They 're even in on it sometimes , right there in the room when they come . They work together . With a , uh ... secret , uh ... corporation . Who in the government ? A man . Military . They 're all in it together . The government knows why they 're here ... " but they wouldn 't dare let the truth out , so they cooperate . You 're gonna have to deal with resolving this situation , Duane , sooner or later . I 'm tired . There 's no other way out . You 've got to tell them what you wanna do . - I just wanna go back to the place . - What place ? Where it started . Where they first came and got me . Where is that ? A mountain . We went , uh ... up and ... up . Ascending , " " ascending to the stars . I 'm not going again . - No . - Mulder , it 's me . Listen to me . You cannot trust Duane Barry . He is a psychopath who took a bullet in the head . He is not what you think he is . What ? How do they find you each time ? Implants . My gums , sinus cavity here in my bellybutton . Tracking devices . Mulder , he could snap at any time . He has a history of irrational and violent behaviour . Now you have to work towards resolving this . Now , you have his trust . You have to try and negotiate with him . Why not let the women go , Duane ? They 'll deal with you if you let the women go . That 's good . That 's good , Mulder . Now , keep him talking . HRT is moving into position and unless you can get him to free the hostages they are going to execute a tactical plan . The women are of no consequence to you . Let ' em go . It 's the right thing to do , Duane . OK , but he stays . Go on . Get outta here . Get up . Go on . Get outta here . Go on . I ... I just want to say that I believe you . OK , go ! Are we safe now ? - The women are clear . - I got him . Standing , centre room . Moving . This is a countdown , Mulder . They 're coming at you . - Position one , ready . - Coming at you . - We 're gonna need transportation . - What do you want , Duane ? A car ? - I don 't know . - Do you know where you wanna go ? They 're gonna tell me . Duane , you can 't leave here if you don 't know where you wanna go . - Duane ! - What ? - Come here . - Hold your fire . You lost your line . - There 's something I wanna ask you . - What ? You didn 't believe me . I had to earn your trust . Now there 's something I gotta know . Are you making any of this up ? You , uh ... calling Duane Barry a liar now ? No . You think I 'd make it all up ? No , I don 't . I 'm sorry . - You 're sorry ? ! - Duane , will you listen to me for a second ? You 're like all the others . You say you believe me . - I do believe you . - You 're lying just like everybody else ! I believe you , Duane ! - I trusted you ! I trusted you ! I was a fool ! - Can I ... Can I say something ? Duane , can I say something ? I know you 're tired , but there 's something you 've forgotten to do . When you let the women leave , you left the door unlocked . Go and lock the door , Duane . Go lock the door . Go lock the door , Duane . Go lock it . They can get in here . Go lock the door . ( man ) He 's down ! He 's down ! ( distorted sounds and voices ) Code three . Repeat . Rolling code three . Medical unit two zero . We 're rolling . You OK , Mulder ? Yeah . Whatever you 're feeling , you did the right thing . I know . It 's just that , uh ... I believe in him . Sometimes when you wanna believe so badly , you end up ... looking too hard . - Agent Mulder . Thanks for coming . - No , I was surprised to get your call . Yeah , well , as it turned out , whatever your impression of the way it was handled I didn 't get to thank you for going out there and putting it on the line . What ? I don 't know . I guess I thought maybe you 'd called me down here to chew me out . - How 's he doing ? - Duane ? They almost lost him , but he 's stabilised . They 've got him listed on critical still . I checked on his record with the Bureau . It was exemplary . His accident was something of a mystery . Shot by his own weapon in a drug stakeout , left for dead in the woods . He was never the same . Lost everything - wife , kids , house . The fine thread of sanity . I actually called you down here for another reason , Agent Mulder . Uh ... In the X-rays , the surgeon found several pieces of metal . In his gums , in his sinus cavity and one in the abdomen . I had them checked . I felt you 'd wanna know . And there were tiny drill holes in his left and right rear molars . A dentist said they could not have been done with any of the current equipment in use . Not without chipping or damaging the tooth . Anyway , I thought you oughta know . This could just be a piece of shrapnel . Duane Barry did a tour of duty in Vietnam . It was right where he said it would be . Along with the ones in his gums and his sinus . And you think this was implanted ? Well , if it was , that would mean Duane Barry is telling the truth . Or some version of the truth . Look , I 'll take this down to ballistics . We can have this cleared up in a second . Let me just make a slight adjustment . What do you think ? Could be a shell casing or a small artillery refragment . The edges are dull , but it could 've been white-hot . That would make sense . But look at this . - What ? - These small markings . See them here ? Mm . Looks like some kind of a stamp . Like it 's been tooled or etched . Pretty fine work too . This square we 're looking at is only ten microns across . Strange . Eleven fourteen . Thank you . - ( woman ) Can I get some help here ? - I 'll be right with you . I 'm just gonna cash up my drawer . ( bleeping ) - What happened ? Did you touch something ? - Uh ... I don 't know what happened . ( bleeping ) ( continuous bleep ) ( Phone ) Hello , this is Fox Mulder . Leave a message , please . Mulder , it 's me . I just had something incredibly strange happen . This piece of metal they took out of Duane Barry , it has some kind of a code on it . I ran it through a scanner and some kind of a serial number came up . What the hell is this thing , Mulder ? It 's almost as if ... It 's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him . ( thud ) ( glass smashing ) - Come on ! - ( Scully ) Mulder ! - Come on ! - ( Scully ) I need your help ! Mulder ! Mulder ! Subtitles by Visiontext ( child ) I made this ! ENGLISH HOH

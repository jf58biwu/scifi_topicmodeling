Something 's come up . [ In Girl 's Voice ] Mom , I thought you said . I thought we were all going to the Apollo Exhibition . But ... my womens club called an emergency brunch . What about Dad ? He 's still going right ? He 's stuck in Denver . I 'm sorry , Wyatt . Why don 't you and Gary go do something fun . Yuk ! Couldn 't you just hide in a closet or something ? Can 't believe my folks are blowing me off again . This sucks . Are you kidding ? You 've got a CD-ROM and cash prizes in one day for no reason . There is a reason . Guilt . They bailed on our weekend and the CD-ROM 's because they 're going on a Christmas cruise and leaving me alone wirth Chett . Your parents are leaving you alone on Christmas ? That 's so ... [ violin music ] Sad ? He 's lucky , my folks drag me up to some kokey cabin in the mountains , we drink eggnog roast chestnuts , my mom makes us sing carols , go outside chop down a tree . Yada , yada , yada . Then he dresses up like Santa and I 'm supposed to pretend that I believe in him . You 're lucky . I never see my parents . Yeah , well , mine never leave me lone . They still think I 'm five years old . Hey , we could trade . Trade what ? Families . It would be a vacation . Can you do that , Lisa ? I don 't think that 's such a good idea . I 'm with her . CHETT : Hey , buttercramp ! Oh ! You , dead , you know why , you know how , you just don 't know when- - Okay , let 's switch . Hold on . I 'm a little stuffed up . So , what did you guys decide ? We 're swtiching ! We are ? Cool . Are you sure about this ? Alright . So when 's it start ? It starts when it starts . You 'll know . Ah , the category is the human body . You want to play with us , Gary ? No . Big surprise . I guess we 're not exciting enough for me , cool . Oh , come on , honey , it 's frivolous facts . Oh , this is a toughie . You ready ? Wait , don 't you answer . If you laid your intestines out end to end how long will they be ? Hey , your mother asked you a question . How long are your intestines ? How long are your intestines ? Um ... 25 feet . - He 's right . - Let me see that . Are you sure you don 't want to join us , Gary ? Really ? Just sit down and play frivolous facts as a family ? No , as a flock of geese . Just play the game . MOM : Wyatt , you 're on your own for dinner , I 'm doing an overnight at the hot springs . The hot springs . Right . Oh , here 's the gold card in case you run out of cash . Wouldn 't want that to happen . Welcome to Wyatt World ! How do you like it so far ? There 's no place like home . Do you care for more jello salad , Gary ? No , thanks , Mom . I 'm stuffed . Wasn 't that a great dinner , Dad ? You bet . Thank you . Are you watching this ? He wants something . Oh , you don 't know that . Maybe our Gary is finally maturing . Ah ha ! My stereo , my big screen TV . My surround sound , my empty house . My wad of cash and my mommy 's gold card . What do you think you 're doing , butt breath ? Listen to my stereo in my living room . Dingle berry . - What ? - Take a walk , you big ugly freak . You have the right to beg for mercy , you have the right to be buttkicked . This canon will be used against you , if you choose to scream , your screams will not be heard above my laughter . Are you nuts ? That 's Mom 's , put it down . I think I 'd rather break it . - She 'll kill you . - No , because I 'll tell her you did it . So , I 'll tell you I didn 't . If it comesdown to my word against yours who do you think they are going to believe ? Me the straight a never a worry son or you the psycho rejectson . Ah . This is not over . I made us some popcorn . So , what 's on tap this weekend , Dad ? Go ahead , Al , talk to him . He 's reaching out . You never care about what I do . Well , I do now . I 'm sure that your father is spending another weekend with Lola . Lola ? Wow . A 55 Thunderbird . Gar , I 'm mean I didn 't know you had a car like this , did I. Yeah , Lola 's really coming together , isn 't she ? 200 horses , dual carbs , overhead lifters . She 's got it all . I love old cars . Since when ? You 're always yammering that new ones are better . Are you kidding ? This is a classic . Do you think maybe I could give you a hand sometime ? I could use the help . Son . Hey . Hey , Moms , how was the cellulite wrap ? Ah , what have you done to my house . I bought you a vice steamer . Oh , this is from my gold card . They were concerned about the accelerated activity on my account . In two days you have managed to spend over 10,000 dollars . Relax , Mom . Pretty soon you 're going to forget this ever happened . Ah . What 's happened to you ? I thought we 'd seen the last of your troubles when we sent you to therapy for that superhero thing . What superhero thing ? When you wore my panty hose on your head and made us call you , Nylon Man . Oh , yeah . I forget about that . [ Phone Rings ] Oh , that must be your father now . Now you are grounded until we can figure out what to do with you . Ten thousand dollars ? No wonder she was so ... [ Lion Roar ] Yeah , come on we 're meeting Wyatt at the Javaman . - You 're grounded . - No , I 'm not , Wyatt is . WOMAN : Here you go . Ah , your money is no good here . Gary , come on . Better let him do it , Wyatt . He owes you . So , what have you and my folks been up to ? Your dad and I have been working on Lola . Lola ? Oh , come on , Gary , don 't you ever talk to him ? Lola 's his sports car . Well , I knew he was fixing up some old car but I didn 't know he named it . That 's weird . Lola 's beautiful , and when we finish , me and Dad are going to enter her in a car show . - My dad . - What ? You said " me and Dad " ? You mean 't me and your dad ? Oh , yeah . So , how 's things going with you ? Great , great , living large . Unfortunately Gary 's been living a little larger than you did . Okay , so I 'm in a little bit of trouble with your folks . But it 's minor , nothing Lisa can 't fix . Right , Lisa . Right . What happened ? Where did she go ? I think the spell just wore off . Back to the poor house . Come on , there must have been a power surge in the computer or something . We better make sure Lisa is okay . Welcome home , Wyatt . How was your day ? Why are you being nice ? You 'll see . I think I 'll let Mom give you the good news . - I thought I grounded you . - Grounded ? I 've never been grounded . Oh yeah , you 're grounded . Your father and I agree it 's time we learned from our mistakes . We don 't want to wait until it 's too late . Like we did with your brother . - What ? - Here it comes . You 're going to love this . Now , the semeter 's already started , but we managed to pull a few strings and get you into Westmount right away . - Westmount ? - What 's Westmount ? Westmount Military Academy . My alma mater . Say howdy to ther worst four years of your life , sis , guaranteed . You were here for less than 48 hours . How did you manage to ruin my life in 2 days . Oh . It 's not my fault . I thought once the spell ended everything would go back to normal . Well , it didn 't . Don 't freak , you 're not going to to military school . Whatever I did we can just ask Lisa to fix it . Right . Lisa . I won 't freak . - Uh-oh . - Where 's my computer ? Got me . Consider it a first instalment . It 's been sold to help pay this credit card bill . Don 't worry , Wy , I know about Nylonman . I think it will help you a get a section 8 . How can you do this to me , Gary ? If I don 't track done that computer , we 'll never find Lisa . If we don 't get Lisa back I go to military school . Just find out who your mom sold it to . Check the receipt . I 'm trying . I can 't break the stupid lock . I got it . It never ends with you , does it ? I 'll call you back . Well , there you are . I 've been looking for you . What 'd I do ? What 'd I do ? Ha ha ! What a kidder ! You push my funny button . I 've got a surprise for you , son . Keep them closed . Okay . Okay , open . Wow ! Lola , right ? Aint she something ? I finally got her back in shape . With your help . Oh , I didn 't really help all that much . Ah . Gary , ah , I 'm not very good at this kind of stuff , but these last few days have mean 't an aweful lot to me . Well , happy early birthday , son , she 's all yours . I am so disappointed in you . Criminals pick locks , Wyatt . I 'm at a loss , my therapist is at a loss . Can you explain where all this rage is coming from . No ! Ah ! Grr ! What do you think you are doing ? Moving in . This is my room . Ah . Ah . Your room 's going to be a 2x2 concrete bunker with a stainless steal pain in the corner as your best friend . - You 're lying . - Oh , good denial . That 's the only way you 're going to make it out alive . That and an elaborate system of bribes . Which reminds me . Here , a carton of smokes . That will get you in good the MP 's Ah , you make it sound like prison . Ha ha ! Oh , dream on . Tell me the truth , is it really that bad ? Yeah , it is . Take the chow for example . What doesn 't kill you , usually makes , you blind . And then there 's the morning drill , obstacle course , hand to hand combat , training , ten mile dash . But don 't worry that 's all out of the way by sunup . You 'll be okay , little bro . I mean , look at me . Westmount made me the man I am today . Ha ha ! Stop packing , I 've got a plan , it 's radical so bear with me . I 'm listening . Full disclosure , we tell your mom everything . Everything ? It 's so simple , it 's brilliant . You tell your mom you made a magic woman , this woman lives in your computer . She has to buy the computer back so the magic genie can come out and fix everything , and this plan doesn 't work at all . Okay , plan B. I push you off the roof . You 'll only break a few bones . There 's no way she 's going to send you to military school in a full body cast . Plan C , you move to Canada . Gary , stop . There 's nothing you can do . Maybe it won 't be so bad . I guess this is goodbye . Will you stop being so noble and slap me or something . I 'd rather you off the roof . Hey , champ . Hey , how can a guy with such a beautiful car have such a long face , huh ? No reason . Come on , you can tell me . What is it , school trouble ? Girl trouble . It 's not car trouble , is it ? Dad , if you needed to come up with some quick cash what would you do ? Paper route , mow a few lawns , babysit . I need 10 grand . Oh , you could rob a bank . What 's all this about ? It 's not for me , Dad . I have a friend who is in trouble . And you want to help out . You are some kind of great kid . No , I 'm not . I just need to figure out a way to get him out of this . I wish I could help , but I don 't have that kind of money . Thanks , Dad . You are okay ? Wyatt , your father would have flown in but he didn 't want you to see him cry . Hmph . When I had to go he insisted on driving . I hope you understand why we 're doing this . No . It 's because we care . Write us everyday , okay . Chett . We 'll miss you . - You will . - Of course we will . But we 'll see you at Christmas . You 'll be on your cruise . Well , we 'll just have to the the cruise some other time . Really ? We can spend the holidays at home this year as a family . I 'd like that . Goodbye , son . - Be good . - Bye , Mom , Chett . So long , sis , they 're going to kill you . Ha ha ! Mrs Donnelly , please you 've got to listen to me . Wyatt doesn 't belong in military school . He didn 't do anything . It was me . Really , Gary ? Do you expect me to believe that . Think about it . Wyatt is the perfect son . Would he charge all of that stuff to your credit card , make all those 976 calls . No . And you know why , because he doesn 't know how to have that much fun . Good point . I didn 't mean for it to happen . I got my hands on your credit card . I guess I went a little wacko . You did the right thing by stepping forward . But there 's still the little matter of the credit card bill . Her name 's Lola . She was a showcar . In your own unique way you 've been a good friend to Wyatt . But what about the ten grand I owe you . Most of that garbage you bought can be returned . I can 't take your car . I will however speak to your parents . Couldn 't you just take the car ? Chett , get his bags . Come on , let 's go home . Thanks for getting me out of that , Gary . Welcome back , Nylonman . Wait a minute , you made me go to military school , you 've got to make him go . I barely made it out alive . I was clinicly dead four time during hazing ! It 's not fair ! Mommy . We must have tried 100 computers before we found you . Lucky for me you did . Ooh , yeah . That 's the spot . So Gary , how are you feeling ? Well , let 's put it this way , everythings back to normal . I 'm poor , I had to give Lola back and my dad called me a boob . But you know what the worst part is . [ Al ] Gary , what are you on vacation ? You 've got bills to pay . Move your butt ! He still wants to spend time with me . Well , see you in September .

Remember what ? About me ... Never seen you before . Why did you help me then ? I didn 't mean to help . You came after me ... and saved me . What did you mean by destiny ? I will tell you . You ... Good ... You 're still alive . So you caused all of these . I knew you could survive . I don 't know you . Fuck off . Your soul does ... Whatever . What do you want ? Time has come . Give me the girl and come with me . No . What are you both talking about ? He really doesn 't remember anything at all ? Leave us alone . No , I 've waited What do you want ? He wants me dead . What ? Come , I 'll grant you a power . Let 's talk between us . What 's going on ? The girl 's blood gives me a power . This is the Forest of Resurrection . The gate . Portal to the other side . Where the dead become zombies ... that 's about it . The real power of the forest is much greater . There are two keys to open the gate to the other side . One is human sacrifice , the other is the Blood of Resurrection . I found them ... 500 years ago . You 're totally insane . Come with me . I 'll show you the power of darkness . Don 't tell me what to do ! Just listen . You can 't kill me . Shut up . You made me wait 500 years for the girl to reincarnate . But I forgive you . I 've waited for her to reincarnate and mature . Today , the forest and her blood will open the gate to the other side . I found you in jail . I never expected you to be serving a life term in prison . Why did you want me ? I like you better as a criminal now . You use to be an awful man ofjustice . You really made me suffer . But you 've changed . That 's why I brought you here . Don 't let me down this time . Get lost ... Your instinct changed you . So far , you 've killed 43 people . You are just like me , little brother . Brother ? Feel the power of the forest ? People are born ... and die . The darkness after death is what 's real ... Come , I 'll guide you . Let your evil instinct overcome you . I 'd rather die than live with you . Then die . As I planned . Get the girl . Don 't you dare touch me . Huh ? Kill me . Still a bitch . And never will . You finished with your roll . You never grow up ... I 've waited ... I have returned after years . And I offered you blood . Open the gate , and grant me a power . Power ! Why ? This can 't be ... Why ? My blood works only once . I 've already used it . Can you wait till I reincarnate again ? I 'll kill you ! Well , did you think I 'd really kill you ? You can 't fool me . You can 't stop me . Your blood is not enough to open the gate . You know why ? Do you understand this ? Why did I bring him ? His resurrected blood is the true key . Cry in despair ! Cry ... Hey . You talk too much . Here is the last key ... Now I remember ... Here I am . Don 't touch my girl , fuckin asshole ! So you wanna play a little before we start ? Wait for me ... Don 't worry . I never lose . Stay there . Wait here for one of us to return . He 's different now . You might lose this time . Maybe ... We 'll see what happens ... No pain , no gain . Right ? Freeze ... Freeze ... I said freeze ! Leave the car . What ! What ! What ! You runt ! We 're taking your car ! Out of my way ! Bugger off ! So ... You are a Fighter . Quiet , I 'm sick of this place ! You short ass bitch ! Come on ! Get in ! Let 's go ! Not my fault ! You ! Prisoner number KSC2-303 ! Give me my right hand back ! I 'm not left-handed ! You can 't hit me ! I have 500times faster reflexes than Mike Tyson ! Come on ! No chance . Your power is not enough . The darkside has chosen me . I told you , I never lose . Listen ... What ? You came back because of the forest and my blood . You might die if you leave here . Maybe ... We 'll see what happens ... I should have been on your side . There 's nothing left to destroy in this world . Take me to the other side , brother .

 Last time on Stephen King 's Golden Years ... Harlan Williams , tech number 10884 . Custodian third . Scientific history , gentlemen . You were here . The janitor 's growing younger . That means that the effects are much more powerful than we had thought . I want to go get the janitor and his wife . I want them clear . Harlan thinks we should be heading the other way . - He doesn 't want to involve Francie . - Leave Francie out of this . She lives in Chicago . She 's got a seeing eye dog named Whitney . - She 's blind ? - Dad ... It 's your face . It 's everything , Francie . Seems I 'm getting younger . The word is that Francesca Williams lives at 895 Clerk Street . - That 's where they 're going . - So are we . - How did you find us ? - We have to leave . Andrews knows you 're here , too . I 'm surprised he 's not here . I want one man in the lobby , one out here . I want you two to go with Burton down underground . Get down in the basement garage . I 'm on my way . Give it up , Terry . It 's over . Damn it ! - We had him . - Doesn 't matter . We flushed them out . Now we just have to run them down . I say we make a run for the airport . Then what ? Then we climb on the plane and take off . Then what ? Then we get airborne and I 'll think of something . We need to think of something now . We 're not going to get a second chance . You know that . We need some time . We need a safe place to stay overnight . - Thanks . - Yeah . Okay . Okay . I know a place we can stay . At least for tonight . A safe house . It 's not polite to eavesdrop . I wasn 't . You talked too loud and my hearing 's too good . Am I supposed to trust you now ? You don 't have a choice . I 've got them in my sights . They 're right there ! Behind you ! Behind you ! What ? Anybody there ? Don 't worry , Ma 'am . As you were , soldier . I 'll take care of those dogs . Okay . Everybody back to their stations . How 's it going ? - Hey , Tom . What 's going on ? - I 'm going to be a grandfather . - Nick Wallace . - It 's a recipe I invented . It 's good . - Cap 'n Trips . - Sybil . Why don 't they head up to the border and find Harry Dobson ? He went back to Australia . Want some more , Terry ? - No , thanks . - How 's your arm ? It 's better . Thank you . Would you like some more ? No , thank you . I 've had about all I can eat . I 'll try some more of this tofu stuff . It 's terrific . Don 't you think the seaweed gives it a wonderful flavour ? Don 't say a word . - I 'll get some pizza . Interested ? - I 'm with you . No , you 're not . What about that guy in Colorado who had the cabin ? He got busted by the feds . Besides , he didn 't do IDs . You 're going to need new IDs . - I know . Richard Rogers . - Yeah . R-2 can do . He lives in Wisconsin on a farm . He can make you driver 's license , passport ... You name it . I 'll go on ahead and get things started . - Can I use your phone ? - There 's one down the street . I 'll call Moreland . Let him know we 'll be back later . I 'll get someone to make the call . Cap 'n Trips . - Yeah ? - Do you mind ? - No problem . - Wait , Louis . Moreland will panic if he doesn 't hear your voice . I 'd better make it myself . Where 's the payphone ? - I 'll show you . - No anchovies . Louis , You can 't go dressed like that . Tick , tick , tick , tick . Tick , tick , tick , tick . Tick , tick , tick , tick , tick . Click ... click . Click , click . Dual control security access keys must be initiated within 0.5 seconds of each other to activate the system . Please try again . Oh , sorry , Dr Todhunter . I didn 't think anyone was in here . That 's all right . - What 's your name ? - I didn 't see you in here . What is your name ? What is your name ? Billy Delois , Sir . I 've got a job for you , Billy Delois . Come with me . But I 'm supposed to do your floors . Billy ... Do you mind if I call you " Billy " ? Do you want to be a janitor all your life ? Heck , no . That 's why I 'm taking the home study course in taxidermy . How would you like to be my assistant ? Yeah ? This is 4-0-2-7 . You beat me . What 's up ? Really ? You ain 't going to believe this , but I 'm out getting a pizza for Williams . - We 're just going to be a little longer . - How long ? - Overnight . - What ? You mean I have to stay here overnight ? That 's the safest place for you to be . Yeah . The blonde , too . Great buns ... Yeah , the military guy is here with me now . Making a call . What do you want me to do ? What 's the number there , in case I need to reach you ? I 'm calling from a payphone . Yeah . But where are you ? What 's the address ? - I don 't know . - Are you in the city ? Major , listen . I 've got to go now . I 'll call you in the morning to let you know our plans . - What time ? - Early . Hang in there . I 'll try . Look ... Here you go . I ... I did exactly what you told me . I tried to do exactly what you told me . I tried . I tried ! You know , I 'm a team player . You make sure you tell Mr Andrews that . You 'll tell him : " Major Moreland . Team player . " Okay ? Now , can I get you guys a snack ? Okay . I 'll ... I 'm going to ... Yeah . All right , Billy . On my count of three , we turn the key at the same time . Got that ? Got it . On three . Your count . Turn key . All right . Are you ready ? One ... - Two ... - Do we turn the key ... on three , or right after you say it ? On three . When I say it . - Get it ? - Which way do I turn the key ? To the right . This way ? - Yes . - What ? - I 've got it now , Dr Todhunter . - All right . Ready ? - One ... - One ... - Two ... - Two ... Three ... Turn it now ! Excellent . Well done . All right , Billy . Are you ready ? Yes , Sir . All you have to do is push this down on my signal . Got it ? Dr Todhunter , I feel like something 's going to happen . Something is going to happen , my boy . A scientific breakthrough . Well , I meant something bad . Why ? You have nothing to fear , my boy . Nothing at all . It 's just the excitement you feel . - You think so ? - Absolutely . Not a doubt in my mind . You 're excited . Excited and determined to do your best . Excited . Excited and determined . Excited . You 're excited and determined to do your best . Excited and determined . Excited and determined . Excited and determined to observe the results of the experiment ... first hand . You ready , Billy ? All right . Let 's get this show on the road . All right , Billy . Now . Do it now . It works ! It works ! It works . It works . It works ! It works ! Billy Delois , it works . It works ! Gina , I 've been looking for you . Everything all right ? Yeah . I 've been looking for my programme . It 's on now . I think it 's on now in Falco Plains , but ... I don 't think they carry it in Chicago . Let me try . There . That 's probably it . You know , whenever I hear this song I think of that night in Baltimore . We danced till 3 in the morning . Remember ? Of course , I remember . Dance with me , Gina . Harl , I don 't feel like it now . If you 're worried about Francie , don 't be . We 'll see her in a few days . It 's better she 's safe in Wisconsin . Now come on , Gina . Dance with me ? - It 'll make you feel better . - Harl ... It 'll make me feel better , too . You had on your purple dress that night . You spent two-week 's salary and traded your sugar ration for the outfit . But my , it was worth it . You didn 't have enough money left for nylons , so you drew a seam line down the back of your legs with an eyebrow pencil . Later on , I rubbed it off . Oh , you remember that now , don 't you ? What ? What is it ? Nothing . Destroying federal property is a serious crime , Major . - This cannot go unpunished . - Yeah ... I was forced to do that . Don 't you see that ? I didn 't want to come along . I didn 't want to destroy those computer files . Why didn 't you call for help when he left you ? What ? Well ... I wanted to . I wanted to , and I was going to ... Thank you . I was going to , but your men showed up . You see , I really was . I was going to and your men showed up , and I couldn 't decide who to call . - That 's what happened . - I 'll bet . I 've got Dr Todhunter on the line for you . Don 't go away . Thanks . Good news . We found the old man . One of your blue agents called in . - Just the old man ? - No . All of them . We 've got the stakeout on the house right now . I don 't want to move at first light . Arrange for backup . Feds and locals . I want the city plans for the whole block . What for ? Okay . I 'll get them . Dr Todhunter . Just a second . We want to take him along with us . We might need him later . - Dr Todhunter . - What do you want ? I 'm busy . - Is everything all right there ? - Fine . What do you want ? I want you to pull the plug . Shut down , till I get back . I 'm sorry . I can 't do that . - It 's not like you have a choice , Doc . - Yes , I do . I 'm here and you 're there . Do you not see that ? Billy , throw the next three switches . Do it now , Billy . - I 'm sorry . I have to go now . - Do you want the janitor ? - You have him ? - Yeah . I Â’ ve got him . Swear on your mother 's grave . I 'll swear on your father 's grave . How 's that ? - Leave my father out of this . - Come on , Doc . You want the old man to experiment on ? I can 't bring him back to a lab that 's a smoking hole in the ground Bastard . The party 's over , Billy . For now . Come in . What 's up ? Louis , those beads really bring out the colour in your eyes . - Is that what you wanted to talk about ? - Have a seat . A waterbed ! I 've never been on one of these things . You missed a lot by spending your youth in the Iron Triangle , rather than Haight-Ashbury . Maybe someday I 'll find out what I missed . Yeah , maybe . So , what about the airport ? I don 't want to go there . I don 't like the way Moreland sounded . I think you want to just keep wearing these clothes . Sybil has an old van we could use . If we stick to the back roads , we could be in Wisconsin in two days . And after we meet up with Francie and get new IDs ? Leave the country . Yeah . You know , this is really comfortable . I checked out the rest of the house . There 's a basement and an access to an old unused storm drain . It 's there if we need it . - You never stop thinking , do you ? - No . That 's why I 'm still alive after being partners with Jude Andrews . I wouldn 't worry about this . We 'll make it . I hope you 're right . If we don 't make it , Louis , this could be the end of a beautiful friendship . Yeah . I got it . Shop Command . We 're good on the street . Let 's dance , Gina . Yes . Slow . It still feels like Coney Island for me . For me , too . Go . Go . Outside ! - Pay him . - Thanks , man . It really is great to see my tax dollars at work . Far out . Sign for it . Sign for it ? - Would you sign it ? Come on ! - I love you guys . Get out of my face . Where 's Moreland ? The house across the street is the command centre . - He 's there , but he 's not happy . - It breaks my heart . Did you get those city plans I asked for ? I 'm working on them . Yeah , you know , time is very short . To quote the good doctor : " Do you not see this ? " I 'm sorry , Mr Andrews . I 'm not getting what you 're saying . Do you get this ? - Do you ? - Yeah . - Do you get it now ? - Okay . - Do you get it ? - Yes . Do you finally get it ? Get me those plans , Burton . Or next time , I 'll twist something else that 's attached to your body . - Do you understand ? - Yes , Sir . - Shall we get up , Mother ? - In a minute . I want to lie here a little longer . I want to be held . I want to feel you close to me . Whatever happens , I have always loved you , Harlan Ethan Williams . And I 've always loved you , Gina , but when you start talking like that I feel a goose walking over my grave . It 's not a goose . It 's that man . Andrews . If he 's not the devil 's right hand , he 's the devil himself . Stop or you 'll just get yourself upset . No , I won 't . I 'm finished with that . But there is something I want to say and don 't you stop me . I won 't . How many times have we made love , Harl ? Since 1941 ? I don 't know exactly , Gina . But I guess if we had a buck for each time , we could buy a Mercedes-Benz . Yes . A lot of times . A lot of love . But this time was different . You felt it , too , didn 't you ? Don 't , Gina . Please don 't . No . Listen to me now . Nothing ever really ends , Harl . I don 't know if I believe in the Heaven my mother believed in , but I do believe that nothing ever really ends . Remember when we were on the road and I said that you were one of the people on the ship , and I was one of the people on the pier ? Well , someday , we 're both going to be on the ship . We 'll be together again . I know it . I feel it . Hush , Gina . Please . But till that time , I 'll be with you . In your memories and in your heart . I will , won 't I ? Yes . - I love you , Gina . - Oh , I love you , too . So , so much . Yeah , that 's right . You heard me . I want those plans in the next five minutes , or I will pull your ears down and tie them under your chin . That 's right . You got it . If I wasn 't afraid that he 'd track me down and find me , I 'd clear the hell out of here . - Just disappear . - I haven 't a doubt . I haven 't seen any paperwork on this . Nope . Not a scrap . This place is a zoo . It 's a damn zoo . I can 't ... I can 't bypass ... Bypass normal channels . And I haven 't seen ... I haven 't seen a budget . What the hell is that ? Who the hell is paying for these men ? Who the hell is paying for these men ? I haven 't seen any ... I haven 't seen any ammunition invoices . No , no , no . No , no , no . I 'm not going ... I 'm not going to bite the bullet on this one . I 'm not going to bite the bullet on this one and I can tell you that ! Attention ! I want everyone 's attention . Gentlemen , without rules what have you got ? You 've got chaos . You have got the jungle . Now ... I 'm going to put a stop to this . As you were , soldier . Hey , hey ! I told you , you 've got to call it off . There is absolutely no requisition for this kind of fieldwork . Do you hear me ? Who 's that in the street ? There is absolutely no authorisation ... - Looks like we ran out of time , Louis . - Let 's get going . - What 's going on here ? - Something big . Something bad . Where 's Moreland ? You don 't get strike one , two or three on this one . You 're out . ... the budget ! - I 'll get him . - Nothing of the sort . Most irregular ... Sharp shooters only . I don 't want the old man hit . This is it . Let 's get dressed . We got to get out of here now . I didn 't go to Canada for ten years to get blasted by these Chicago ... - We 're surrounded . - Doesn 't look good . What will they do to us ? I don 't think anybody should do anything until we talk to them . - Right . - Yeah . See what happens when we don 't get a consensus about who crashes here ? - They 're ready to commit violent acts . - We didn 't start it . This place is open to anyone in need . - You know the rules . No firearms . - He 's right . Francie knows better . You knew you were coming . You shouldn 't have brought guns . Getting trapped inside a house with a bunch of granola heads wasn 't exactly on my daily calendar . It just happened . - Why are the police here ? - It 's none of your business . I 'm afraid it is . You have put all of us in jeopardy . The police don 't want us . They certainly don 't want me . I 'm going to negotiate with them to let us go . - I don 't recommend that . - I don 't want to see people get hurt . We can settle this without violence . If that 's what you choose as a form of discussion , you can do it yourselves . After we 're all gone . Sybil . Everybody stay here , where you 'll be safe . We 'll be all right . They 'll listen to reason . Why don 't you all chant and hold hands while we 're outside ? Let 's get out of here . It 's going to be a bloodbath . Tell me about it . Hold your fire . You , on the first floor . Come on out . Nobody 's going to hurt you . - Ready ? - Ready . Come on out . We can talk about this . - Who 's in charge here ? - I am . - What 's your name ? - Jude Andrews . Hey , Jude . I 'm Tom . I want you to let myself and my friends go . Send out the old man and the young woman . Nobody has to get hurt . I can 't do that . Whatever problem you have with them you must settle for yourself . I 'm not the one with the problem here , Tommy Boy . You are . You 're starting to get on my nerves . Look , we don 't want any violence here . You said we could talk . Talk 's over . Take them out . They shot them ! No ! Hey , you . - They can 't find the city ... - What 's his name ? Cap 'n Trips . Trips ... All right . Smoke them out . We 're fucked . You can say that again . Get Harlan and let 's scram . - I hope that tunnel 's open . - Better be . Keep the fire trucks back till the old man 's out of the house and safe . - Captain ... - Sir . - I want a tag team on the perimeter . - Right . Come on . Move it in . This is your last chance . Come on out . Get that live one out before it burns someone . - Help me . - Hurry ! Come on ! Go ! - Come on . - I don 't think Gina 's able to . - I said I 'm all right . - What are we waiting for ? Come on . Follow me . Keep low . Where 's the old man ? Get him out of here . They just got here . I don 't know if you still need them . You think they 're still in there ? No . They 're gone . - Where are we going ? - After them . - I 've got to sit a spell . - We can 't stop . - No . - She 's not feeling well . They 'll figure out we 're not in the house . - Harlan , go on without me . Please . - No , I won 't ! We 'll sit a minute . We 'll sit a minute . - We 're Louis ? - He was right behind me . Louis ... Louis ? - Louis ? - Stop it . Command centre . - Andrews here . - What 's your status ? I 've got him . Come pick us up . - Harlan ? - Gina . Get away from him . Hold on to me , Gina . Get away from him or I 'll blow your brains out . - What 's happening ? - Don 't let go , no matter what . Let go ! I can 't see you , Gina . Don 't be frightened , Gina . You 're coming with me . Let go ! You 're coming with me . Well , I 'll be damned . - Terry ! - Well , I 'll be damned . I took a wrong turn . But then I heard you shouting . Where 's Harlan and Gina ? What the hell 's going on ? Do you believe people get a second chance in this world , Louis ? What ? I think they do . I think we just did . Let 's go . They 're going to come looking for him . Terry ... Do you want to go non-reg for a minute ? - What for ? - Maybe for the rest of our lives ?

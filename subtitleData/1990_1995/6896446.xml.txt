It 's not possible . Our baby . Yeah . MAN : Nick , come on ! I 'll find you . Come on , Nick ! Come on . I 'll find you . Tv ANNOUNCER : A 24-hour curfew has been imposed on the city . Our armed forces are using heavy rocketing and strafing to drive the mayday terrorists out of their stronghold . According to government sources , they are totally isolated from the overwhelming majority of our population , and their defeat will be final within hours . A state memorial service will be held to honor the late commander 's fighting spirit as it was documented in a statement just hours before he was killed in such a hideous and cowardly way . We 're gonna win . We have the force . We have the faith . And we will not rest until we 've purified this country , this nation ... In the name of God . Come on out with your hands up ! ANNOUNCER : As house-to-house searches continue , the acting state commander has put all forces on alert to find the assassin . He said , " she will not escape , nor will her accomplices . " We will search for them . We will find them . We will hang them . " Kate , voice-over : I don 't know if this is the end for me or a new beginning , but I 'm safe here in the mountains held by the rebels . They bring me food and sometimes a message from Nick . And so I wait . I wait for my baby to be born into a different world . I still dream about Jill , about them telling her I don 't exist or that I never existed . I know we 're going to find her . She will remember me .

 Tell me what the Zafrin general is saying . He ordered them to replace the seeker that collapsed . Pity . What a waste . These colossal Decimators were designed to be " the final weapons " on my world . Liboh is the most notorious of them all . Its production was stopped after only a few models were made . It utilized a system which linked the pilot and machine organically . This enabled it to achieve an extraordinary degree of maneuverability . However , there is one critical flaw . The machine fed too much data into the pilot 's brain . It enhances the aggression of the pilot , causing him to lose control . In the end , the pilots began to a ttack everyone ... no matter who they were , even allies . It was then that we decided to destroy this model completely , yet- - If they were destroyed , why does this one exist ? It must be caused by the shifting of dimensions ... that occurred during time oscillation . The Decimators that your people are using come from the future . They are the weapons you are supposed to invent someday . Weapons of the future . No point in getting rid of them now then , is there ? Negativity creates nothing . The only hope of changing the future lies in one 's own will , Lean . Cornel , the time oscillation bomb cannot be activated while Liboh exists ? Correct . How does it interfere with Nataruma 's physic waves ? It seems the Liboh 's pilot and Nataruma have something in common . Deep in their minds , both of them hate people . Unfortunately , nothing makes a person 's mind oscillate as easily as hate . Five times married ? That 's right . He married and divorced twice before he met me ... and has been married twice since then . Ryan , help bring our guests a little tea , will you ? Thanks , Ryan . We must be disrupting your life so much with our visit here . Don 't worry about it , Toria . It 's something I got used to over time . Manning always needs favors . Have a boyfriend yet ? I only have three girlfriends . You could be my fourth girlfriend , if you 'd like ! Strange how children often inherit the characteristics ... that the parents least want them to . Observe , Manning . Alumasurah . Alumasurah has been destroyed . So much for Alumasurah , eh , Manning ? Within two or three years ... this place will house beautiful flowers and greenery . The bodies will make good fertilizer . Let 's try the city of Pholuri . Better still , we should try Nelsulseus . Majesty ! Please don 't be angry , but I must speak . I humbly submit that your purpose is now accomplished . You mean to say ... we don 't require any more flower gardens like Alumasurah , Manning ? Sire , I mean that this war is quite obviously over , and you 've won . It 's not war , Manning ! Manning , you are my only subordinate , so I 'll explain to you . Heed me . It 's just flower gardens , Manning . I love them and despise foolish wars . My mommy is sick ! Open the door , please ! Are you all right ? You were yelling . Bad dream ? Don 't worry about it . I have very bad dreams all the time . Oh , no ! Escape it ! What happened ! The old man ! Don 't fire ! Most of Zafrin 's major cities have been destroyed . The remainder will be in ruins by the end of the day . Question- - Do you think I might operate Orguss II ? It is your intention to stop Liboh ? Well , its operating system is similar to the one ... that your people have been using . But being unable to see- - I will be Lean 's eyes , Cornel . I have a feeling you will go no matter what I say . Once you reach 8,000 norde , level off and maintain that altitude . Target is 160 minanorde , to the south-east and is moving west . Encounter estimated in 6 1 / 2 minutes . This town will be fun to destroy . I think that we should try burning it down with the laser weapons , eh ? Encounter estimated in three minutes . Switch offense and defense systems to automatic mode . Your laser weapons are ... useless against Liboh . You must use missiles . There are six left . Use them where they 'll do the most damage- the cockpit , housed in the head . - Roger ! I can offer you no further support . Lean ... Nataruma ... good luck ! Good luck ! I 'm turning ' round ! We missed the cockpit ! Ah , my arm ! Lean ! Wait ! We 'll lead him to an unpopulated area ! It 's behind us ! It 's impossible to escape ! He 's comin ' up fast , Lean ! We 'll come out of the cloud cover and attack ! It 's the port of Darlia , sire . Majesty , we 're in Rivilia territory ! Ah , hush up , Manning ! Impressive . They 're moving via telekinesis . It must be Lean and the girl ! Nataruma , this is our last missile . We can 't afford to miss ! We 've got to get really close , although we might be killed ! I understand ! I 'm sorry . I wish we had a choice ! What the hell ? Mother , I saw something flash . Can you see inside the cockpit ? I sense someone 's there . Lean , this is Manning ! Can you hear me ? Manning ? You 're controlling Liboh ? Ha . Not me , Lean . The creature who was is- - Heh ? Manning ! What happened , Manning ? ! Answer me ! Payback . You have a great deal of nerve , to fight a king . You 're King Perion ! Your pilot is blind , but you still dare to do battle . Don 't wait ! Shoot ! Lean ! You seem to be running outta power . A little more . Almost there . Do it ! I have launched all my bombs . In three minutes , your world will come to an end . I hope you enjoy living in the ashes . All of that and for nothing . Cornel , we can start . The time and space oscillation bomb has been activated . You two did a wonderful job . I thank you , Nataruma , and please forgive me . Now I must say good-bye . I , too , must leave . - But why ? - I don 't have any choice . Cornel said I 'm not supposed to live in this world . I 'm a contradiction . You 'll leave or vanish away ? Sort of both . I 'm going to another world . Why don 't you share your conversation with me ? Hell , we 're all gonna die anyway . You know what ? I don 't wanta leave this world . I want to stay here forever . I 've had bad experiences here ... but still , this is the place where I grew up . Nataruma ! Now even my eyesight 's going . That city must be- - Lean , I 'm so glad that I got to meet you ! I love you so very much . Nataruma ! My God , that 's Lean and Manning ! The pain ! Can 't stand it ! It hurts bad ! Help me ! I can 't bear it ! - No sale . - I see your acting hasn 't improved . Always after female sympathy . C 'mon , I have broken bones ! Maybe , but you 're a far cry from dying from it . Hey ! You went and grew up , didn 't you ? Gone . She was gonna be my fourth girlfriend , and now I 've lost her . Well , Ryan , sometimes you win , sometimes you lose . That 's just how life works , son . After the war , there was still a great deal of confusion . The smaller countries who had been annexed by Rivilia and Zafrin ... declared their independence . Rivilia became a small republic . Lean never told me what had happened inside of the Decimator ... or explained to me what had become of Nataruma ... though , in truth , I have never asked . We moved back to Geran and began to run our repair shop again . Lean took my father 's old rifle and hung it up on the wall of the shop . I have never really understood why . It has been two years since all of this took place . Let us banish poverty ! Let us defeat injustice and allow hope to be our- - Good people of Geran ! I , Gillofer , appeal to you . In the upcoming election , please give your ... precious vote to Gillofer , friend of the people ! Pay no attention to the words of that liar preaching his poison ! Such a cold-blooded animal is up for election . He 's buying votes on his way to Congress , I hear . Hey , it 's Toria ! Well , long time no see ! Lieutenant Manning ! I 'm not in the army anymore . Buy some ! As an old friend , I 'll give you an excellent price ! Here 's a little item that 'd suit you perfectly ! Katarina ! I just opened this shop three days ago . I run this little enterprise with my new wife . I told her to give you the very best prices . Thanks . Excellent choice ! I see you 're a person of discerning taste ! You 've picked out the best item in the shop ! 'Bye ! Say hello to Lean , all right ? If he wants to make a lot of money , tell him to come visit ! Now 's the time to be a businessman ! Money is buried in the city crowds ! You 've just gotta learn how to dig for it ! I 'm back ! Right on time . Supper 's prepared . Hope that you 're hungry ! Lean ! Mom 's got dinner ready . Thank you . Lean , there 's something I 've been meaning to ask for a long time . Why did you put Dad 's rifle up there ? I 'll explain at dinner . I 'll tell you and your mom . I have something to tell you too . I met an interesting man at the market today . Who ? Not yet . We 'll both tell our stories at dinner . Look ! Wait ! She looks dead . I 'll try tickling her . No , don 't ! We should tell the others ! Without clothes , I bet you 're cold . Where are you from ? You just appeared suddenly . I come from far away . It 's really hard to explain . Very hard to explain . Navy food really stinks ! The stuff 's even worse than I heard it would be ! But in another week we won 't have to worry about that . That 's true enough . When we get back to Geran , I 'll ask Shil and Toria to cook up ... the greatest dinner you 've ever had in your life ! Great ! Sounds good ! Raise the salvage ! Well , Zante , what do you think ? At a glance , I 'd say it 's in good shape . But to be sure , I 'll have to take a look inside . After all , it is a ruin , heh ? Put it back in the ocean , quick ! That may be a reconnaissance plane ! What 's your problem ! Let it go , drop it ! A Shanger prop engine ! Sounds like it 's the 21 model ! What ? It 's one of ours . It 's an allied plane ! Well , should I still dump it back in the ocean ? Pleased to have you aboard , sir ! I 'm Second Lt. Tiket , in charge of this vessel , at your service ! First Lt. Manning , the Imperial Guards . That 's good , that 's good ! Hold it there ! We weren 't aware you 'd be arriving ... but we 're trying to find appropriate accommodations for you . Good . My subordinate will require accommodations as well . It 's a seeker ! This one is all right ! It 's not in nearly as bad shape as the others . How 's it look ? Do you think we can use this ? 50 or 60 years ago , there were some models ... equipped with an activity monitor instead of a periscope . But this one is dead . We have to replace her armour plating . Hey ! How 's it look ? This junker 's the best one we 've found , I 'm afraid . I see . You haven 't had much luck , I guess . Sir , it 's possible we might find a better one . We 're still looking . Okay . The only thing we can do is restore it . - May as well get started . - Heh ? Restore it ? But how ? I 've brought tools and replacement parts . I want to get to Geran with this Decimator , today ! I suppose that it is possible , if you brought parts . If things came easily , then life would be boring , wouldn 't it ? You 'll have to work fast , a Zafrin battleship 's coming . We 're countin ' on you . Zante ! Do the rest of the work on the way to Geran ! So you 're saying I can go back with you ? Right now ? Correct ! Hey , that 's great ! Right ? In a big rush , sir ? You can bet your allowance on that , kid . We need operable Decimators . To defend the capital ? Is there a war coming ? You 're sharp , aren 't you , kid ? You think and you observe everything . Good work . - Pass me the screwdriver . - Here . Now I need the number eight wrench . Here . - Is it fixed ? - Yes ! You 've done a fantastic job ! I 'll see you get a week 's pay as a bonus ! Thanks . I appreciate that ! A craft has entered our vicinity , sir ! Moving fast ! It 's a Decimator ! And it 's closing fast ! Gunners ! Anything ? Gunner one ! All clear ! - Nothing to report ! - Gunner three ! Nothing ! Distance is closing ! Below your tail ! Below your tail ! Damn ! He 's got us good now ! We 're dead ! He 'll stay there and take us apart ! So , what the hell ! What 're we going to do ? He 's gonna find us ! We can 't stay hidden in the clouds ! I know that , kid ! And we can 't parachute out . No idea where we 'd land ! Right ! Limited choices , kid . Grab a seat . But I don 't know how to fly a plane ! Give me a break . I know that ! When I give you the signal , I want you to press that button . That 's the hatch release button , isn 't it ? If I open the hatch , then what ? I take off in the Decimator . You mean the only one who 'll get away is you ? It beats everybody dying , doesn 't it ? He 'll chase after you ! I 've got no choice ! Well , then again- - Lean , please ! This is crazy ! You 're untrained ! Even an expert pilot has trouble with one of these ! I have to ! It 's the only chance that we 've got ! Right ! I 'll pilot the plane to safety and give you instructions via transmitter ! Almost outta the clouds ! So get ready to fly ! Roger ! Clear ! Set to go ! The enemy is above you and to the left . Kick on your thrusters and go right ! You idiot ! Let the thrusters out slowly ! Much better ! Watch it ! He 's swinging above you ! Go left ! Impressive ! Real nice work ! 'Kay , don 't let yourself tighten up , kid . Has he got a prayer ? Tell me ! Not if we keep him in the air , he doesn 't . What ? Lean ! Do you read ? - Yes , sir ! - Our fourth engine is on the blink ! I 'm going to bring her down in the river . Listen up . Here 's my last order . If you want to win this fight , get the enemy on the ground . - How ? - You 'll figure it out ! The fool ! It 's only a matter of time now ! He 's been watching too much wrestling ! Game over ! Lean , this is Manning and Zante ! If you 're alive , answer ! I beat the enemy . All right ? You scared the hell out of me ! I 'm fine ! So , no one was hurt ? Nah , not a single scratch , kid . Great ! I 'm heading back ! I 'll show him our position with this . Good . A hell of job . The kid was great , just great . No , come back ! Lean , be careful ! We 're in a zone ! Armed Decis everywhere ! They 've tracked our craft and are approaching ! Get over here , but be careful ! They 'll both be slaughtered ! Lean , don 't ! Go back ! Oh , no ! Boss , you 've been hurt ! Hold on , I 'm coming ! Lean ! I forbid it . Don 't come ! Run ! Go back ! Go to Geran ! No , boss , I can 't leave you ! Hey ! You guys save the melodrama for another time ! Get your ass over here ! I 'm only 32 years old . I 'm too young to die ! And when I do go , I don 't want it to be like this ! Right ! Here I come ! All set ? And up ! Twenty ! Nineteen ! Eighteen ! Seventeen ! Sixteen ! Fifteen ! Fourteen ! Thirteen ... twelve ... eleven ! Ten ! Nine ... eight ! Seven ... six ... five ! Four ... three .. two ... one ! Whew ! You all right , Zante ? Heh ? A loyal citizen of Rivilia ... and of our leader , the most noble , King Mendez . Zante was a civilian ... but yet had the honor of dying while defending his homeland . Brother Zante has now entered the hereafter . Dear friends , we are gathered here to lay to rest our dear friend , Zante . We who loved him , pray for him and bid " farewell . " Let us not ask ourselves how will we carry on without him . Those that we loved never leave . Zante will remain with us in memory forever . Zante will remain with us in memory forever . Those that we loved never leave . Zante will remain with us in memory forever . Zante will remain with us in memory forever . Pay homage to our brother , Zante . Homage . Homage . Homage to Uncle Zante . I am Johnson from the National Bank . I 'm here to speak to the widow of Mr. Zante . Is she present ? I am she . Good . I am here today to discuss the loan Zante had with us on his repair shop . Your choices are few . When the original signator passes on ... you 're really only left with two possible alternatives . It 's really quite clear . You have the option of paying off the loan . - Now then , can you pay it ? - No . Not now ! That is- - Of course . I knew how you 'd answer . Instead , we 'll take possession of Zante 's mortgage ... in lieu of our actually receiving all the money owed to us . What the hell 's wrong with you , banker ! Lean , please ! Don 't ! We 're in the middle of a funeral ! Show some respect ! Unfortunately , I have several other pressing matters ... which I must clear up today . Anyway , it appears that we 've resolved this . All right , then . Madam , if there 's a complaint ... then we can settle it in court . That 's right , take a bank to court ! Hey , I bet you win ! Lean ! No , let me go ! Please ! Oh , please ! No ! Please ! I 'm sorry . My behavior today was foolish . Hush , Lean . Listen , I wanted to punch one of them as well ! We were both dreaming of coming back to a home-cooked meal ... that was prepared by you . I wish he hadn 't taken that military job , even if the money was good . The house feels empty without him . But what about the mortgage ? What 'll you do ? I have no real choice , do I ? I 'll give them the mortgage . You can 't ! The boss worked so hard to get that place on its feet ! He 's right ! I 'll work . I 'll quit school and go to work ! I suppose I could take another loan to pay off the first bank ... but what 's the use ? I 'd just get deeper in debt . Now that Zante is gone , we won 't have much work coming in . There 's no way to keep the repair shop . I know that we owe you back pay , Lean , but this is all that I have . I don 't want it . I can 't accept it . You need it more than I do . I appreciate your thoughtfulness , Lean , truly ... but you 're going to need another job ... and you have to keep body and soul together until then . We 'll be alright , don 't worry . War , gentlemen . War ! I believe it 's obvious . Zafrin intends to invade . Yesterday 's attack at our border ... was a deliberate provocation against our sovereign state . I say to you that it is in our country 's best interest ... to strike before the enemy strikes ! I say to you that we would be foolish to wait for them ... to launch a full-scale attack ! Let us not be made fools of by these Zafrin scum . There is only one way to protect Rivilia from Zafrin ! Let Rivilia declare war , gentlemen ! War ! I agree ! I believe Minister Kerachi 's proposal makes perfect sense ! - I agree ! - I concur ! - As do I ! - Me too ! - I agree ! - So do I ! Agreed ! Hmm . Akamasu , what is your opinion ? I still hold to my original opinion on this . The country is in crisis . We 're financially insolvent . High taxes are hurting the economy . War now is foolish ! The people will rise up in rebellion ! Our country is in crisis ! You suggest we kowtow to malcontents ? I suggest that we be very careful not to destroy our country ! What ? Now , heed my word ! I say that we prepare for war ! My lord ! We will consider the place of attack later . The skirmish was too close to our borders . We cannot fight them there . We must consider alternatives . - But , sire- - - No war yet ! We will watch and wait , Kerachi , and our chance will come ! We will take action , but we must not confuse our allies . It shall be as you wish , my lord . Miran , bring my medicine . The doctor . Right away . This is compensation for a life ? This is all Zante was worth ? Not enough ? Odd . What 'd you expect ? Zante had a family ! And he died defending our country , didn 't he ? Zante was killed by a Deci when we landed in a zone , not by the enemy . Accidental death doesn 't pay much . It makes me sick ! Unfair ! Yeah , it is . But , of course , Zante was a civilian , wasn 't he , Lean ? Now then , if Zante had been a soldier , different story . So , how about you , Lean , my boy ? Wanta join ? I think you 'd make a good soldier . Heard about the bank . Wanta foreclose , don 't they ? I know who to call . I think we can get her bank difficulties cleared up quickly . You need money , am I right ? There 's a war coming . Wanta get rich ? ' Cause being a soldier 's gonna be very lucrative . There 's money in war , boy . Join up and you 'll be rolling in wealth ! Toria ! What 's going on ? Look at you , you 're soaked ! Here . The banker told me where the money 's coming from ! You joined the army to get money to help us , didn 't you ? And you requested four years pay in advance , right , Lean ? Lean ! What were you thinking , or were you at all ? Do you have any idea what it 's like to spend four years in the military ? Don 't jump the gun . Look , Rivilia 's not even at war ! I 'll probably spend my time hanging around the barracks playing cards . No , you won 't ! There 'll be a war ! There 's going to be a war . Everyone knows that , you jerk ! Please don 't call me names , Toria . Jerk , idiot , fool ! I hate you ! I hate you ! Sounds like we 're in for another war . Just what we need . Terrific , isn 't it ? Pardon me ? War . I love it . Death , destruction and easy money ! Lean becomes a member of the palace guard ... and , accompanied by Manning , travels into the heart of Zafrin territory . While there , they learn of a girl who is being chased by the Zafrin military . Then , they must face the might of Zafrin 's secret , a giant Decimator . All this and more on the next episode of Orguss II : " Where Angels Fear to Tread . " - So , how 's the military doing ? - It looks like war . Kerachi has gotten all the right-wing generals on his side . Navy , as well ? They 're neutral , but Akamasu 's losing support . I 'd guess , he won 't last another month , Manning . Hey . So , this is the new meat . Second floor , third door on the left . - Then meet me at the front gate . - Right ! - Better watch it , kid ! - Huh ? A cat has got nine lives . You 'll need more if you hang out with this guy ! Sorry I kept you ! Come with me , Lean . We 'll walk . The Imperial Guards are under the authority of the king himself . So our rules are different from the navy and army 's . Our duties are entirely different as well , Lean . We can come and go without answering a lot of questions . First fall to blue ! Within our ranks , there are many sons of high officials . They 'll make good hostages when their fathers get ideas about rebellion . Rebellion ? You can bet on that ! Some general always wants a coup . When he does- - Manning , was that the king ? No , not his highness . That was Perion , his son , going for a ride . Look across the lake , eastward . Do you see the portion of land where everything is concrete ? Yes . That 's our Decimator base . It 's heavily guarded . We have a total of 80 Decimators ... all of them restored to perfect condition ... and our pilots are the best ! - Am I going to be a pilot ? - You must be kidding ! You have to destroy 10 Decimators using a plane ... before they 'll even consider you ! Pilot duty is for the few . Not even the big shots ' kids get to fly Decimators . The only exciting duty left for us is spying on other countries . Quite profitable , as well . I see . Good money , is it ? Yeah . I have a question . I 'm just a civilian . I never did anything for the military . How was it possible for me to join the Guards ... just because you recommended ? I 've got a few good friends and my reasons , as well . What 's that ? They 're summoning all the priests to the temple . The king is ill , so they pray for his recovery each and every day . Your Majesty . Time for your medicine . Sit up now . I feel better today . I haven 't felt this strong in several years . Good ! You can 't imagine how that makes me feel . My lord , I do hope you won 't suffer a relapse . Your Highness , Perion ! Tragic news , Your Highness , tragic . It 's the king ! The king has died ! Let 's be sensible , gentlemen . Our relations with Zafrin are declining daily . At a time such as this , it is obvious what sort of king we require . You obviously feel Perion cannot sit on the throne . He cannot . I suggest Siplay instead . So you would cast away all tradition without a thought ? He 's not the eldest , and he 's only six years old ! In 10 years , he will be 16 . He will be an adult . Perion will never change . He 'll never mature . Common sense must dictate the succession . Tradition cannot be ignored , nor can sovereignty ! Enough arguing ! I shall state my decision ! Siplay shall be the King of Rivilia and loyal Kerachi shall be his new regent . I support your decision ! And I ! Please , my Queen ! Don 't question my mother ! I don 't like you ! You 're wise , Your Majesty . I agree . Arrest him ! Filthy conspirator ! You dog ! I know what you 've done ! The Fourteenth Dynasty of Rivilia , King Siplay ! - Glory upon him ! - Glory upon him ! We offer a prayer that his reign will be a long and peaceful one . Bless our new king ! Lean , notice anything about the flags ? Some are shaped like squares and others , triangles . The triangles indicate they 're supportive of Zafrin , right ? Right . And the squares represent countries which support Rivilia . It means there 's a lot of disagreement between the countries . It means there 's lots of money to be made , sonny . I doubt that we can successfully cross the Zafrin / Rivilia border . I suggest we pass through the neutral countries ... and enter Zafrin via one of their borders . What you say makes sense , but if you are caught ... it might start a war . All plans involve a certain risk , I 'm afraid ! Yes . Nothing ventured , nothing gained . You will be risking your life , as we both know . You 'll be rewarded . Heh ? Very well . You 'll get started immediately ! Sir ! We work well together . Lieutenant Manning . Kosmar ... in Zafrin ? Yeah . It 's just a mining town , right ? So the public thinks . Interesting ? Two years ago , a lot of Decimators were found there . It 's the largest Decimator excavation site in Zafrin . Why are we going there ? You haven 't explained that . I thought it was obvious . We 're going to steal everything they 've got . I never would have expected it . - Expected what ? - You , in a military uniform ! It 's still the same me underneath it . Lean , are you eating properly these days ? - Sure . - Is the food good ? Or awful ? It 's okay . Lean , you 're awfully quiet today . You all right ? Toria , talk to your mom . Tell her that we 'll reopen your dad 's old shop . It 's essential that she doesn 't give up the land . Lean , why do you think we can reopen ? Are you doing something dangerous just to get money ? It 's nothing like that . You swear ? Don 't lie to me ! Time you got some sleep . Long way to go . Better rest your body . May I ask a question ? You 're a recruit who likes questions . Of all people , why did you choose me for this assignment ? Once there was an old fox and a young fox who worked together . They 'd sneak into barns and steal all the chickens . Are you getting my drift , Lean ? Of course , once the farmer heard them , he set out the dogs . They caught the young one pretty quick and then stopped hunting . While the dogs were devouring the young fox , the old fox got away clean . A good story , isn 't it ? Weren 't there supposed to be fewer guards when we arrived ? Why were all those soldiers at the station ? Looking for deserters , who knows ? There ! Time to get to work ! Was that a question ? Those soldiers- - could they be searching for us ? Don 't worry the small stuff , kiddo . But we 've stolen clothes ! We took some clothes from a brothel . No big deal . No one gives a damn . It 's not like we stole a Decimator . Time for me to give the place a little once-over ... check out their so-called " mining site . " - What about me ? - Keep your homing device on . I 'll come back when I can . Just sit tight . Yes , sir ! I saw them too . They 're searching for this girl . Quiet will you ! Do I look deaf ? I heard you ! Your Majesty , the seekers have completed their preparations . What in the world ? All right ! Work , will you ! Why , they found something huge ! Here come the bloodhounds ! It won 't do any good to wait for the sun to set . We 'll see about that . There are soldiers everywhere . An ant couldn 't escape from Kosmar . Why don 't you give yourself up ? Really ? Maybe you should give yourself up too , Rivilian . You are a spy , aren 't you ? This old device communicates ! You use it to talk to people far away from here , don 't you ? Lean , do you read ? I was discovered , stole a Decimator and am escaping ! Get on the roof and signal me with a light . I 'll rendezvous with you in five minutes ! Over ! Look ! You simply must put down that gun ! I 've got to escape and you can come along with me . Now , be reasonable ! So now you want to help me , do you ? Do I look like a fool ? You prefer remaining here ? We 'll keep each other company until the soldiers capture us , ' kay ? Can 't hit what you can 't see . Uh ! What 's that ? What kind of force is that thing emitting ? Increase the image . Ready ! On the roof , Lieutenant ! That 's- - Verifer ! It 's finally risen ! You mean , that thing ? It 's huge ! There 's the light ! Lean , where are you ? I don 't see the light ! Do you read ? Are you all right ? I read , sir ! Banged up , but we 're okay ! I cannot locate you , and the enemies are approaching . It 's impossible to rescue you ! This is the last message . - Listen carefully . - OK ! Good luck . Good luck ? A liar ! Rivilia and Zafrin finally began an all out war on each other . The mysterious girl and Lean attempt to escape from Zafrin ... but they run in to an enemy squad as they are about to cross the border . All this and more on the next episode of Orguss II : " Fugitives . " You know how to speak the Zafrin language , and I don 't . You 're being chased by soldiers and I want to get back to Rivilia ! It seems to make sense that we 'd cooperate , y ' know ... work as a team , not shoot each other . Let me know when you 're all finished chattering . Look , who has the money we need and a forged permit as well ? So I can cross the border , unlike yourself . The only thing you 've got going for yourself is that gun . Think again ! With this gun , I 've got it all ! Freeze ! If you 'd rather escape by yourself , go ahead . I 'll shoot you ! Shoot , that 's real smart ! Let the soldiers know your exact position . A truce then . But only for the time being , agreed ? We 'll go over this ridge to the north . There 's a path that we follow . It 'll take us west . It 's kinda steep . Do you think you 'll make it ? A walk sounds great . Walking is almost as much fun as shooting ! I can see that we 're going to have a great time . Let 's rest for a minute . Silly as it seems , we weren 't introduced . My name is Lean . You can call me any name you like . I answer to " hey ! " or " Let 's keep moving . " Aircraft ! What 's up ? Move it ! That 's a Zafrin reconnaissance flight looking for you , I guess . No kidding ! I know that . There 's plenty of clothes in there , and they are all women 's . You 're telling me to change ? The clothes you 're wearing are odd . Identifying you 's easy . Good thinking , for once . - I 'll shoot you if you peek ! - I 'm not that kinda guy ! That 's what every guys says just before he peeks ! Don 't be so angry . I 'm supposed to be happy wearing this ? You prefer taking ' the risk of being caught ? Fine for you to talk ! I 'm dressed like a whore ! Look , it- - Ah , you chose a new name for me now , did you ? " It " ? We agreed you 'd disguise yourself . You should change your hair style . Why don 't you undo your hair ? - No ! - But you 'd- - Dream on , pervert ! The plan has been an enormous success , First Lieutenant Manning . Thirteen Decimators survived the first battle . Huh ? That many of them ? Mm-hmm . Now remember , I sent over a hundred of them to fight . A survival rate of over 10 % is excellent and all thanks to you . I applaud you . Well done , Lieutenant . Huh ? Lieutenant ? You are a resourceful soldier . I think you 've been a first lieutenant long enough , don 't you ? Yes , sir , I do ! I mean , I greatly appreciate the honor , sir . I 'm sure . It 's also my policy to reward good work . As we agreed , cash . Thank you . But I 'm afraid I have something to report which isn 't pleasant , sir . While I was spying on the Zafrin in Kosmar ... I saw a Decimator which was unlike any that I 've ever seen or heard of . I would estimate its total length at well over 200 norde . Over 200 norde ? Ridiculous ! I wouldn 't believe it either if I hadn 't seen it with my own eyes . It attacked me with a very powerful light or laser weapon . You 're a comedian as well , Lieutenant . I only wish I were joking . - Explain . - A fugitive , sir . I saw soldiers seeking this girl all over Zafrin . I believe she has a connection to that huge Decimator . Then let 's hope they haven 't caught her . He 'll take us to the city ! Don 't talk so loud ! It 's all right . He knows you 're a Rivilian . - But I had to tell him a little fib . - A little " fib " ? Hey , exactly what did you tell him ? I couldn 't think of anything else to say ... so I said that I 'd been sold to a whorehouse and hated it . And it was because of- - 'cause of love . I said my parents did it because I had a foreign boyfriend , you ... - and that you rescued me . - Boyfriend ? He was young when he got married , around 18 . His wife was a beautiful woman . 'N what else ? She left him for his best friend , then drowned ! From the sovereign of the great Zafrin empire ... I convey to you the grave words of His Majesty , Skalamanga . It is no longer possible for us to ignore your aggression ! The discourtesy shown by the tyrannical government of Rivilia is unforgivable ! Zafrin , a peace-loving and unaggressive nation , has been unjustly attacked ! Our wise and benevolent emperor makes this declaration to you . And request that all hostilities cease , immediately ! So declared to the Rivilian kingdom ... on this , the 12th day of the 21st month of the Zafrin year 432 . Signed by Skalamanga de la Shanty ! Please verify the emperor 's name and handwriting . Although you are our enemy , I admire your message . I truly do . - I have a small favor to ask of you . - Favor ? Siplay , our majesty , is young . I 'm afraid he 's never had the opportunity to witness a real war ! Seeing a man die would amuse His Majesty . Do you mind ? Heed well ! Listen ! From this day forward , I , Kerachi , on behalf of His Majesty ... shall lead our armies , for Rivilia is at war ! War ! It 's war , listen ! He gave us his lunch . Thank you very much ! Easy now . Guess this is it . I 'll need my passage permit . I 'd like my portion of the cash as well . You won 't be on the train . What ? Betrayal at last ? No , I wouldn 't . There 's a wanted poster of you in the booth there . I 'm sorry . What are they saying ? Snuff the Rivilians ! Kill Siplay ! Victory to Zafrin ! War , war , war ! Let 's steal his truck . How 'll we do it ? - Your weapon . - The gun ? More powerful than that . You out of your mind or what ? Why use me as a weapon ? We 've got a gun ! Ha ! But no bullets . What ? You knew ? With that type of gun , you can see the chamber 's empty from the front . But I didn 't notice it yesterday . Then it 's likely the soldier wouldn 't have noticed right away either . If he 's a pro , he 'd know immediately . A pro ? Then what are you ? You didn 't notice . I joined the army two weeks ago . In fact , I worked as a mechanic before that . We 'll reach the city soon . Then it 's not far to the border . Think we 'll have trouble at the checkpoint ? Probably . My guess is we 'll need to use your skills again . Using my body as a distraction , I bet ! Want me to run around naked ? Will that do it ? No , thanks . I want you to be a man . A man ? Too close for comfort . I thought that we were caught ! We 'll be okay now . Ten minutes to the border and we 're safe . You wanna eat something ? Sure thing ! I 'm starving . I could use a little food . It 's two sandwiches . Lean , which do you prefer , the egg or ham ? What ? Gee , you spoke my name ! It 's a first ! We all have names ! You 're no exception ! You must have one then . Nataruma . Very beautiful . It 's awful ! That nice old man 's city has turned into a battlefield . Rivilian Decimators just butchered them . Nataruma , listen . Zafrins are killing , too , in my kingdom . They 're coming . What ? Who ? The soldiers , Lean ! Step on it ! The gas ! Hold on tight ! You ready ? Look up ! See the woods ? As soon as we get there , jump out and head for the border . I 'll keep them distracted ! What about you ? What are you going to do ? Don 't worry ! Go on , quick ! Come on , do it ! Jump out ! Jump and roll ! I like to go walking , not rolling and running . Were you always this mule-headed ? Run ! I think you can still make it ! I told you , I really hate running . You 've been wonderful . Thanks a lot . Rivilian ? No . I 've never seen that before ! It 's not Rivilian . Lean ! Watch out ! They 're ours ! We did it . We crossed the border ! Apparently it 's 230 norde in size . Corporal Gustuff ! Gustuff reporting , sir ! Measurements taken on this cannon are totally inaccurate . Get it fixed ! Yes , sir ! With the giant Decimator , the war is going in Zafrin 's favor . Crossing the border into Rivilia is only the beginning of Lean 's journey . There are chambers of horror where all fear is to be taken ... on the next episode of Orguss II : " Searcher " . What 's up , the enemy sneaking into the garden ? Ha , ha . It 's Manning . He 's talking to a girl . Looks like he 's breaking up with her . Doesn 't seem worth watching to me . Sorry ! Personally , I 'm sick of Manning and all his trouble with crying girls . This one 's different . She 's 15 , maybe 16 . Huh ? Fifteen 's a baby ! He 's a cradle robber , all right . Gimme that ! Well , the great " playboy " at work ! He 's not a playboy , he 's an animal ! I hate you ! I could be wrong . Maybe he is alive . A second lieutenant of the Imperial Guards , sir ? That 's quite a position to achieve at such a young age . Just coming from the front , are you ? I 've been on vacation . Ah , I see . Have a good rest , sir . Thanks , I will . You must be tired . The train arrives in the morning . You 'd better rest up . We get blankets and sit in first class . So what 's next ? Is there a 21-gun salute when we arrive in Rivilia ? Admit it . Ah , c 'mon . You saw them in my hair . You wondered , " What in the world is that ? " Well , don 't you have some questions ? " What in the world are you ? Are you human at all ? Where did you get those ? What kind of thing are you ? " Yes , I do have a question . Go ahead . 'Kay . Do you have anywhere in Rivilia where you can stay ? Where you 'll be safe ? You look surprised . I apologize , but I can 't tell you very much about her . I ask your permission for her to stay . I realize it 's quite an imposition . I would take care of all expenses incurred , like the food and- - Lean ! All this talk about money ! Honestly , Lean ! Now then , dear , your name 's Nataruma ? Yes . My husband recently passed away . Since then , this old house has seemed big and empty . No one lives here but my daughter and myself . I thank you . I am very grateful . Follow me . I 'll show you the room you 'll be staying in . It 's upstairs . It 'll be all right . It 's the extra room my husband worked in . It may still smell of cigarettes . Any damage to it ? There 's nothing , not even a scratch ! Brought something ' for you ! Eat it ! - They got it ! - A direct hit ! - What ? What 's wrong ? - Run ! The Sixth Major Division was almost complete destroyed . The enemy is quickly approaching the Wisteria River . It was impossible to prevent the giant Decimator ... from breaking through our lines . I expect that it 's just a matter of time ... before it breaks through the Second and Third Division defense lines as well . How fast does it travel , Major General ? Three thousand norde an hour , I 'd estimate . It should arrive in Geran in three weeks . Kerachi , what is the meaning of this ? We only started this war because you guaranteed we 'd win it ! Please , I beg your indulgence . I assure you I will conquer that monster ... even if it costs me my life ! You have a plan ? I do . It had better work . Yes , Your Majesty ! Baron Topio 's son ? He transferred to the Fourth Regiment . You won 't find him here . Heh ? Would you mind repeating that one more time ? My hearing 's not what it used to be . Tomorrow night , 10 : 00 . Your subordinate 's waiting for you upstairs . He 's angry ! Hmph . I see . He was " angry . " You did something rotten to him , didn 't you ? I 've only ever tried to be nice to him . I don 't believe it ! I thought women were the only one you were nice too , Manning ... and young girls ! I try to treat my subordinates as nicely as I treat women . Good luck ! Good luck ! At attention , soldier . You 're not a ghost after all ! Don 't get me wrong , Lean . I 'm not crying because I 'm so overjoyed that you 're still alive . I just didn 't want to pay for your funeral . I 'm proud that you survived that hell . Thanks , Lieutenant . No , " commander . " Well , scum , are you ready to talk ? Warm him up . I thought you 'd still be angry with me . About what ? Our argument . That was all an act . Then you 're really not worried about that Decimator ? I 'd prefer to discuss " other things " tonight . What if Siplay wakes up ? Don 't concern yourself . After all , he is " our " son . So they passed the Wisteria River , did they ? Yes . That monster broke right through our defensive lines . Their infantry follows behind it . It 's a simple strategy , but we can 't stop them . I understand , sir . You feel I can be of some help ? We torched the Zafrin spy . What we learned leads us to believe that ... the girl in the picture hasn 't been arrested by them yet . Somewhere around Frowrick she managed to escape from them . Possibly she crossed the border . So , you know what to do , Commander ? Make wanted posters . They 're being printed now . The reward 's been set at 2,000 rintsu , sir . You were a step ahead of us all . One kanuto of beef is 23 syzara , and a kanuto of sausage is 30 syzara . Your change is 10 and seven syzara . Appreciate your business . Thank you . Do you believe it ? 2,000 rintsu for her capture and 1,000 just for her location . Who is she anyway ? I 'll bet she 's a spy ! That explains why the military wants her . She could be Zafrin Royal Family ! Whatever she is , she 's wanted . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? What are you looking at ? It 's about to rain ! That 's what I mean . Beautiful rain will fall like golden jewels from the sky . All I see are criminals being taken to jail . I wonder what they did . Spies , revolutionaries , terrorists . Anyway , they got caught , so what 's the big deal ? I suppose you 're right . But still- - I see . You sympathize with them . That 's why you can 't see all the beautiful clouds above us . But people are being killed . Don 't you care at all ? When you 're at war , you 're supposed to fight . That 's a soldier 's duty . He kills . What happens if civilians are killed , like small children ? Why worry about it ? In war , things happen . Besides , no one can change the past , can they ? So you feel bad because you killed a man . Do you think pity 'll bring him back to life ? - Are you Commander Manning ? - Yes . Report to Minister Kerachi at once ! She 's not here anymore . She was captured by the SP . I 'm not lying . I saw them take her . It 's too late , Lean ! You can 't save her ! You turned her in , didn 't you ? That 's right . For the reward ? That 's what you think ? - Let go ! - No ! You 'll try to save her and then you 'll be killed ! If something happened to you , I couldn 't go on ! I beg of you , don 't leave . It was for me , wasn 't it ? I heard that anyone concealing a spy would get the death penalty . I didn 't say anything to mom . I brought Nataruma to the middle of town and left her there . I didn 't take any money ! They 'll find out about me , Toria . Spies are torched with a burning coal . " Torched ? " I 'm sorry . I never should have hit you . But now I have to go . I 'm alive only because she helped me to escape . I owe her my life . I 've gotta get her out . She won 't turn you in . Even if they torture her , she won 't say a word . Don 't worry . She won 't betray her love for you . Toria ! Go ! Shil- - I could hear you arguing from down here . I think I know what 's going on . I hit her . I 'm ashamed to admit it . I love her , but I forgive you for getting angry . - Are you going to save her ? - Yes . Your career in the Imperial Guards will be over . Do you care ? It doesn 't matter . I wanted to make money , but it was a foolish way to try to do it . I never should have joined the army . The gun was owned by Zante . You 'll need a weapon to fight them with . Shil . I never wanted to be a soldier . All I ever really wanted was to be a great mechanic like Zante . Lean . Tell Toria I 'm sorry , will you ? I believe she 's being questioned by Minister Kerachi ... and Commander Manning right now . I see . Commander Manning . That 's perfect . He 's the one I have the message for . Take me to him immediately ! Sir ! That 's enough ! Questions are a waste of time . A little heat will loosen up her tongue . I 'll make you scream before you die ! Minister , an emergency call ! If you could open the door . Please , sir . I 'll do it . Get the coals prepared for her . What are you doing ? Lean ! Damn you ! - You move , you die . - You wouldn 't shoot , right , pal ? I would ! I consider this my private war ! You seem pretty serious , huh ? Nataruma , try to get loose , then come over . Get the handcuffs from my belt and put them on this jerk . First you hit Minister Kerachi , then you call him a name ? Well , in war " things happen , " don 't they ? That 's just a quote I heard from you . So , gonna tie me to the chair ? Pretty smart , aren 't you ? Not really . I forgot that in my last radio transmission with you back in Kosmar ... you said , " We 're okay . " You escaped with her . All done . Good . There 's a uniform there on the ground . Better put it on . I 'm afraid you 'll have to do it right here . I understand . It 's fine . Lean , don 't gag me , knock me out , ' kay ? Please ? Otherwise , it looks bad . Whatever you like . May I mention one thing ? You can 't fire a 22-type rifle without loading a bullet in the breech . Next time , pull the bolt first , then aim the gun . You knew that . Why didn 't- - You see , I 'm a whimsical person , Lean . I like to follow my instincts , like , for instance , right now . There are three gates to pass . If we get by them , then we 're fine . Have a good night , sir ! Don 't run ' till we pass the second gate . Stay inconspicuous . Shut every gate in the palace ! Even the third one ! Ready the Decimator squadron for takeoff ! Don 't forget to give them all transmitters ! Yes , sir ! Their letting the minister and the army handle this was idiotic ! Sir ! Shut the gate ! We can make it ! It 's the last gate ! Halt ! Let us out ! It 's an order ! I don 't give a damn who you are ! You 'll stay right there ! No one leaves ! Get out , quickly ! Meet you later ! The Tamiyana gate at the third wall ! Repeat . The girl is at the Tamiyana gate at the third wall ! Toria ! Where in God 's name are you ? Can you hear me ? Hold it ! Nataruma ! Are you all right ? Nataruma has lost consciousness . She must have used too much of her powers . Don 't go near her ! I 'm warning you ! Careful ! Don 't hit the girl ! Incredible ! Was that a gunshot ? Answer me ! What 's going on ? What happened to the girl ? I-I don 't know how to explain this . Are you completely nuts ? Gimme an answer ! The girl 's escaping in a Decimator ! We 're chasing it now ! It transformed ! It 's thrust power is too strong . There 's no way I can follow it ! It 's disappeared into the clouds ! You damn fool ! Commander , your subordinate was a piece of crap ! He 's a traitor ! The problem of finding the right subordinates is shared by many . What ? I 'd prefer that you sat . You 're insane ! Minister , I 'm not as mad as you . I didn 't help kill the king and have an affair with the queen . What do you want ? What the hell 's your game ? I 'm just a simple solder , one who is from a wretchedly poor family . We 'll arrive soon . We can attend to your injuries once we get there . I can 't begin to thank you for all of your help . But who are you , sir ? My name is Cornel . I am from a country called " Mu . " The intrigue continues as Lean and Nataruma learn the truth ... which lies behind the facade of the world . Meanwhile , the war for power within Rivilia rages on ... while Manning engages in his own secret maneuvers . And Akamasu launches a desperate attack ... against the giant Decimator , " Verifer " as interest and armies clash . The next episode of Orguss II : " Destroyer . " Serve the tea . Will it snow all night ? I think so . There should be a blanket of white by tomorrow . What a beautiful night . No , it 's not ! It 's very ugly , actually ! The few times you bother to speak , it 's all nonsense ! Why don 't you try learning some manners from Siplay ? Siplay ! What ? What 's wrong , Siplay ? Siplay ! Siplay ! Siplay ! Call the doctor , immediately ! Don 't just stand there ! Breathe , darling , try to hold on ! The doctor will be here in a minute ! " Death comes to visit while the snow is falling . " That 's what my grandmother used to say . By the way , I suggest that you call for a monk , not a doctor . The final rites n 'all . Siplay , Siplay ! We need an antidote ! Doctor , please ! Help us ! Where are the ministers ? I have gathered them together in the throne room . Here is the declaration . Ah , excellent ! I serve only you . We shall meet with them . The world is reborn , Manning ! In the cosmos I had a dream , dreamed I saw this world 's destiny . Shapes of silver cut through the dark , purified through the tragedy . See , a shiver , deep , runs through the flesh and blood ... penetrates Can 't you see it , the memory shining ? through time and space ... Can 't you get it ? And in the darkness , in your eyes it 's phantoms I see . Steel-like intentions , hot as flame , as everything melts away and even time 's fabric is in sway . Can 't you get it ? And in the darkness ... Phantoms stay , can 't you see ? You must be cold . Feel free to use the clothes I 've put out for you . I 'm in the next room treating Lean 's wound . You are late ! I see you 're as grumpy as ever , eh , Uncle ? And you still can 't tell time ! What happened to Kerachi ? Kerachi is dead . I , Kerachi Torunado ... now confess the truth in the name of God . First , I conspired with Queen Miran- - A problem , Kerachi ? Yes ! I won 't continue with this farce anymore ! - Don 't stop confessing ! - Insect ! Let him speak ! Ha ! I admit that I made the queen pregnant ... and helped to assassinate King Mendez ... but I did these things so that I could help protect our country from Zafrin . I feel only pride . You want to kill me , go ahead ! I don 't regret a single thing . - Now , stand aside . - Yes , sir . Well , son of a coward , do you have the courage ? Can you kill me ? I 'd better try . It seems I 'll have quite a bit of killing to do from now on . It 's the cost that you pay when you seek power . You misunderstand , I do not seek power at all . - I just want to protect the garden . - The garden ? A fitting end for Kerachi , and Miran ? Miran ... He 's thirsty . Bring him a nice glass of tea . Your Majesty , Lord Siplay is , oh . Of course , I 'll go immediately ! Come on ! And don 't put too much sugar in the tea ! And be sure to put a lot of milk in it ! He likes to have his tea with a lot of milk . Gone quite mad by the sound of it . Philimon , sure you know where we 're going ? Heading for the lake , sir . Lord Perion is waiting on the small island . How are you , Lean ? Do you feel at all cold ? Actually , yes . But I think can handle it , sir . I 'm glad you 're not too uncomfortable . Unfortunately there 's only a suit of clothes for Nataruma . Although I am getting the impression ... that she does not like these clothes very much . You want a laugh ? It 's as embarrassing as the outfit you gave me . Gee , it 's a shame I can 't see anything . You will be able to see again in about a month or so . Nataruma , you possess a power unlike any found in ordinary people . Of course , to you , it 's all seemed very mysterious . I , on the other hand , know all about it ... since I 've been searching for your tribe for 200 years . Two hundred ? Follow me . I want to show you something . Tell me who you are and I 'd like to know what you are ! You say you 've been searching for 200 years . Human beings don 't live that long ! I am telling you the truth . Discovered the secret of immortality , is that it ? Nataruma ! We have to be careful , Lean . This place is filled with strange machines . And he claims to come from a country we 've never heard of . I am not a human being . What 's the matter ? As you can see , I am a robot . And a machine does not age like a human . Prince Perion- - I mean , my King Perion ... I sympathize with the hardships you 've been forced to endure all these years . Save your sympathy , Akamasu . Tell me how I can destroy that monster . I believe there is a way . I think we must blind him , sire , take away his eyes , so to speak . According to our reconnaissance ... the enemy seems to dispose of its seekers after their use . If we can prevent the supply of seekers , it will render the Decimator useless . Ah , and how can this be done ? We must stop all resistance ... and allow the monster to come deep into our territory ... right up to here , the very edge of Geran . Then we cut off their supply lines ... using all of our military forces in a quick thrust ! There 'll be a great deal of damage done to the country , of course . Never ! I understand , King Perion , you care about the sanctity of the country , but- - Quiet ! We will not sacrifice a single inch of our beautiful Rivilia ! So devise something else ! But , King ! Kerachi 's collaborators can be used as excellent sacrifices . You will be in charge of that , Manning . King ! Please , reconsider this ! Huh ? What 's the matter , Uncle ? It 's the ground , it feels warm . Heh ? It does seem odd there 's no snow . This is the weapon which triggered the great tragedy . It 's the " time and space oscillation bomb . " - What sort of a bomb is it , Cornel ? - Not one which explodes . The time and space oscillation bomb ... was designed to transport its target into a different dimension . However , it turned out to be an imperfect weapon ... as it not only a ffected the enemy , but a Iso all surrounding space . Inadvertently , it combined a variety of different dimensions , creating a mosaic . As a result , beings from different dimensions ... ended up living in an entirely new place . Naturally , a variety of strange encounters ... and unpredictable incidents took place . Meeting and falling in love with a being from a different world ... this girl became pregnant- - their child is your ancestor . Because of the mixture in blood from three different worlds ... you possess an inexplicable power . We fought another war ... this time trying to restore the dimensions to their original states ... and we reactivated the time and space oscillation bomb . Our attempt succeeded in most ways . However , certain worlds and peoples were thrust into yet another world ... including myself , injured as I was . That is what happened 200 years ago . Two hundred years . That 's exactly when the Decimators appeared . We also caused your world to become entangled with our troubles . The Decimators have brought nothing but destruction and death to your world . We are responsible for all of it , all of it . It sounds like you feel you 're the one responsible ! It is I who must right this wrong . Gonna make a donation ? I 've got it ! You 've been given the power to bring the dead back to life , is that it ? All I can do is attempt to remove the opportunity for pain ... and destruction from the living . But how ? Is there a way ? I will eliminate all Decimators from your world . For that purpose , I have created this machine . However , in order for me to operate it , I need your help , Nataruma . Help it operate ? Huh ? That thing ? You built- - Is it- - It is the time and space oscillation bomb . It is the only way to return each world to its proper dimension . Get up , come on . Lean wasn 't caught . They 're searching for him . I have no idea where that traitor could be hiding . I thought you were going to ask me questions . Can you read it in this light ? " In Belz city , " " On Vandal Street , " and " Valetta- - " Valetta 's a woman ? We used to be married . Inside the envelope is a letter . You 'll find that it explains the details . There are two tickets for Belz inside of there . I want you to take your mother with you and leave right now . You 're just going to let me leave ? Are you deaf ? The train leaves at 7 : 00 . Now get going . But why are you being so kind ? Go , before I throw you down on the ground and rape you ! Bless you . Thanks . I don 't like playing this role all of the time . Number five ! Number five ! Isn 't this the stuff they excavated ? I wonder if it even works . I heard that it exploded by accident 100 years ago in a city ! What happened to it ? Disappeared . It blew the thing up . What is the location and direction of the target ? It is proceeding as predicted , sir . Its current location : 24 minanorde , east-north-east of here . Its estimated arrival time is 6 : 30 a.m. tomorrow . Report our current status . We have only 12 left . In about 30 minutes , we 'll begin to camouflage , sir . The Regent ? He 's still down there , reviewing the troops . Lieutenant Nashua , age , 25 ! Second Lieutenant Warden , age , 26 ! Lieutenant Fidalgo , age , 30 ! Captain Balmerino , age , 29 ! They 're all young soldiers , sir . Not one is over 30 years old . And they 're all goin ' to hell . How 's it feel , sir ? The target is in sight ! The distance is 200 ! Target 's in sight ! At 200 . Repeat , target is in sight ! Coming up pretty fast now ! About 80 ! Distance , 80 ! Units , prepare ! Repeat , units , prepare . Get ready for takeoff . The distance is 50 ! The distance is 30 ... 20 ... 10 ... The target has arrived ! Get ' em up , now ! Decimators , launch ! Come on ! - Bombs aren 't exploding ! - Huh ? They 've exploded ! There 'll be a big shock wave ! It 's over . It 's still standing ! It 's still coming towards us , sir ! We should run away , Lord Akamasu ! It 's too late . We 'll need a definite axis of coordinates ... in order to put back the broken pieces of time and space . I can calculate the coordinates ... if I 'm able to observe your psychic wave accurately . What on earth does that mean ? If you want to put a piece of a jigsaw puzzle back in place ... you need to know its proper location : it 's latitude and longitude . Your bracelet is the compass and you 'll play the role of the North Star . But you need a map to chart it on ! I have one , this monitor . To be exact , it will project your psychic waves . It is ready . Close your eyes and concentrate your mind very hard . Clear your mind of all thought and look far away into the universe . Further still , as if you could see the very end of the universe ! You alright ? So , Akamasu died , did he ? And the Decimator , where 's it ? It 's proceeding forward without any pause . Despite the fact that it 's lost the lower half of its body ... and has been moving at half its former speed ... it doesn 't seem to have lost its attacking ability . It completely demolished the defense line set up by the Fourth Battalion . It will arrive here , sooner or later . Here , Manning , look at this . They made it smaller so it 'd fit on Siplay 's head . Pretty funny , isn 't it ? Aren 't you coming with me ? Manning . Uh , of course , sire . You are doing well . The psychic wave has become stable . In order to prevent that bitch from assassinating me ... I have pretended to be mentally retarded for seven years . There was nowhere that was safe . Only on this little island could I be myself and have sanctuary . The little flower garden here became my kingdom , Manning . I found this about a year and a half ago . Majesty ! What on earth is this room ? It 's very strange . King Perion ! Be quiet and watch ! Nataruma ! Be quiet ! K-K-King ! Shocked , aren 't you ? Don 't be . You 're standing in the cockpit of a giant Decimator ... just like the one the Zafrins have . I did not want to use this Decimator if there was anyway I could avoid it ... because I hate to ruin the flowers and the trees . But none of that matters now ... since it 's obvious that the enemy will destroy them anyway . Now we depart . You and I shall plant new flowers . Plant new flowers ? We shall defeat their Decimator , you and I. Nataruma ! Someone is interfering with the psychic wave . We can 't operate the time and space oscillation bomb ... under these circumstances . What 's that sound ? I will project an image from the stationary satellite ... on the screen upstairs . Stationary satellite ? It 's like a reconnaissance plane . It will help me locate whoever 's disturbing the psychic wave . Could it be a relative of Nataruma ? That would be impossible . In this world ... Nataruma is the only descendant of Emaan who possess tentacles . You 're positive , then ? Yes . It was about 200 years ago when I woke up in this orbital elevator . I dragged my broken body ... looking for useable parts and kept repairing myself . It took me 20 years to fix my body ... and then another 80 to build the time and space oscillation bomb . I spent the next hundred years creating the Decimator , Orguss II . It was only eight years ago ... when I ventured into the outside world for the first time . I began to search for a descendant of Emaan ... whom I saw in subspace when I transferred to this world . One day I heard a story about someone with a tentacle . I found the village she lived in , but by then it was too late . Nataruma had been captured and her mother had been slain . However , I did learn one thing . Tell me ! Nataruma 's family line has been producing only females . Besides that , once they give birth , they are unable to reproduce again .

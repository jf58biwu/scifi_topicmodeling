Stay on the ground and shut up ! - Liz , can you look more closely at the case ? Good girl . Good girl . - Perfect , that 's him . - All right . Let 's find this guy . - Lieutenant ? I think we found a place to start looking for him . - Demer university research institute . Where do we start , department of armed robbery ? - It 's dr . Reece . He had a project with us . - Had a project ? - The institute canceled his funding . He wasn 't prepared to share his data . - What was he working on ? - Well , I , uh ... - We could subpoena your records . - Naru Reece is an erratic and brilliant physicist . He was working on a small beam accelerator . - What 's that ? - It fires subatomic particles , which break up the structure of matter . - It 's not exactly a new concept . - Well ... normally such an accelerator is enormous . His fits in a suitcase . - Would this accelerator machine blow a hole in metal ? - Well , in theory it could penetrate the very fabric of the universe . - We need his address , now . - Okay . Apparently he 's hit upon hard times . The forwarding address is 15 dok street . - It was only a test run , doc . - No , zann , I just wanna be paid and good-Bye . - don 't you wanna move to a nicer neighborhood ? - I said " No . " I just want enough to complete my work . Give me my machine . - You 're not hearing me , Reece . - What-What are you doing ? Don 't touch that . Please , you don 't understand it . - I don 't understand hoppers either ... but I can drive ' em . - It 's your suspect , all right . - We had one damn lead , and now it 's a-a cremated , headless torso . - I tested the bone Marrow dna , it matches Reece 's birth records . - Carson , what 's that smell ? - They used cyclopie to torch the body . - What 's that thing ? - Melted plastic . I wanna take a closer look at it . - Well , we 're gonna bag everything in here , if we have to . Hey , you , selmar , get in there and find something . - Not a single witness . - the apartment 's clean , no sign of struggle . - Get these people outta here . This is a crime scene , not a street party . - Well , if I didn 't know him better , I 'd think he was taking this personally . - Come on , Matt , you always get to sit there . And one time I get it and you take it . I was sitting there . - Actually , you weren 't . But that 's okay- - You can have it anyway . - What 's going on , Matt ? - I 'm being mature- - Mom says I have to . - It 's been a little tense today . - How you feeling ? Look , I know today was- - - We 're okay . - Good . But , you know it 's all right to feel angry or scared . - Nope , fine . - Honey , I 'm sorry I wasn 't there today . - It 's okay . - I 'm sorry . - It 's only a ring . - Why you fighting me on this , lieutenant ? Public relations has to issue a statement from the officer in charge . It 's regulation- - So give ' em one and shut ' em up . - Okay , we 're dead in the water . - Oh , tell him that . - Yeah , right , start a panic . Look , captain , we 've got a robbery crew with a machine that will punch through anything , maybe even the whole planet , and we have no clue what they 're gonna do with it next because they just murdered the only lead we had . Now you want me to tell ' em that ? - Well , maybe some regulations are made to be broken . - Zannadu mining , this is b of a armored transport . You scheduled a pick up . - Affirmative- - You are clear for docking . - the bank security guys are here . Get that in there . - Okay , zann . - We 're getting up to 900 ounces out of some of these asteroids . [ guard whistling ] - That 's a lot . Wow . - Yeah , I hope you guys are on the ball . - Mr. Zann , sir , we 're the best . You 'll , uh , follow us in your Hooper . - Absolutely . - All right . - Just park in the public base and meet us at the vault elevator . - Gotcha . - And , uh , this is the most secure room you 'll ever encounter , Mr. Zann . Solid star density steel . Ah ... as a , uh , champaign class depositor , you 'll receive 26 hour service access . Your health . - Thanks . - Thank you . Please . Open , says me . Come along . - Thanks . Wow , there must be a billion in here . - Oh , a hundred billion- - Gold , black platinum , altorian silver . It 's , uh , tax time . - You know , I 'm real happy about this vault . - You 're in luck . You know what this is ? - Reece 's brain ? - Close- - It 's Reece 's day timer . And guess what ? The waif is intact . - Can you read it ? - No , But slomo can . - Okay , slomo , we need some names . Scan his appointments . Where was he going ? What was he doing ? Who was he meeting ? - Whoa , whoa , whoa , slow down , lieutenant . The directory contains Dr. Reece 's appointments for the past ten years . I will proceed from the beginning . - Uh , no , no . Start at the end , metal head . - Last dated entry is zannadu enterprises inc . - There she is , zannadu enterprises . It 's currently licensed to an Alvin zann , New York city . Small universe . - Yeah , too small . I know that name . Check him for priors . - He 's through there . - Hey , a couple of human cops . - What 's your business on altor , zann ? - Just working for a living . - What a letdown after robbery and attempted murder . - Bull ! - Hey , what do you know ? - Everything , Buddy . You got a rap sheet that oughta be delivered with the morning paper . - Ancient history . Guy eventually gets smart . Now , what do you want ? - Know him ? - No . - Well , guess you didn 't get any smarter . - Name 's naru Reece . He contacted you nine days ago . - Let me look at it again . - Oh , yeah . Might have been that nut who phoned me ... once . - What 'd he want ? - Money . Some invention . Supposed to be great for tunneling mine shafts . - But you weren 't interested ? - I 'm not interested in shafts . I like to run with the rocks , catching pay dirt , wherever it goes . - Yeah , us , too . - Look , uh , I got work to do . Anything else ? - No , that 'll do it . Oh , please , don 't leave altor without notifying the police . - Say pretty please . - like I said . It 's him , no question . Now let 's push him . I want 26 hour open surveillance on zann , and don 't forget his crew . Check for outstanding warrants , aliases , parole lists , immigration , too . Took , castle , I want you to sit on his Butt . Move it ! Haldane ! - Looks like zann 's headed downtown . - With a bad exhaust . Gotta be violating emission codes . - But when we pulled in the Hopper , it wasn 't zann . One of his crew was driving . - Dammit- - He 's decoyed us . - Hey , want some doughnuts ? - No , I 'll get fat . What the- - - Hey ! - Get outta the Van ! - There 's no time- - leave it . We gotta get outta here . - Okay , okay ! - Come on ! - Hang on a minute , Jane . - Brogan , got an armored Van robbery . Zone 12 east . Perp 's heading for orbiting , yellow Hopper . Same as the jewelry heist . - Copy . Let 's go . - there , I got a blip , about 30 degrees out . - There , two O 'clock . - Looks good- - Let 's Reel him in . - Alert , collision eminent ! Alert , collision eminent ! Alert , collision eminent ! Alert , collision eminent ! Alert , collision eminent ! - What the hell is that ? - Drive 's out . Man , server 's cooked . Zero function . Eject- - Eject ! - Go ! - Officers took and castle to dcpd recovery . What 's your status ? - Dcpd recovery vehicle a-10 , we are proceeding to disabled unit , twenty-Three arc decrees off Sub beacon ray five . You can tell your boys the cavalries coming . - sit tight , guys . The recovery vehicle 's on its way . - What hit you ? - I don 't know , tookie . But whatever it was , it was big and it was fast . - Hey , Janey- - It 's awfully cozy in here . You sure you don 't wanna join us ? - You 'll have to come up with a better offer than the back seat of a cruiser , haldane . - All right , watch closely . This is the security recording from the armored Van . The perps cut a hole in the rear door of the vehicle with the same device they used for the jewelry center job . As you can see , the guard tries to fight back , but his shots are absorbed by whatever the hell that thing is . Now , here 's the peculiar part . They seem to change their minds about stealing the money . The assumption is that something frightened them off . But we 've no evidence to support that . So there it is . What have we got , Carson ? Well ... it 's like a hole , deep as infinity . Scariest thing I 've ever seen . There 's no way to protect ourselves from it . - Well , what are we gonna do about it ? - Turn it off . But not while it 's expanded . It 'll be a hyper vacuum slamming shut . The concussion would blow you right through the walls . - captain , I-I don 't get it . Zann 's got this powerful machine . He uses it to knock over an armored Van and then he doesn 't take the money . I mean , we 're missing something here . - Yeah , like a plan to nail this sucker . - We gotta get in there and search that mining vessel . We need hard evidence . - You 're going to need evidence before you get a search warrant . So , get creative . - Zannadu enterprises This is dcpd ... open up for safety check . Okay , check the light fixtures , the tool boxes , fire extinguishers and anything else you can think of . - What are you looking for ? - Mistakes . - Try the mirror . - 750 mag pro , full auto clip . - Legal and registered . - Recently fired . - I had a lizard rat problem . Big one- - About your size , Brogan . - Yeah- - You still got a problem . - Hey , guys , fellas , be careful . Thanks , guys . - open this , please . - What for ? - Checking for undeclared fruit . - I , uh ... forgot the combination . - I think I know how it goes . - Hey ! - Oh , boy , look . - Flesh mags . - Tsk . - Tsk . - these are the getaway vehicles left lying around . Very unsafe . - What vehicle ? We just melted down some scrap . Well , since you made the trip ... Let me show you something . - there 's nothing up front . - This is more than you two will make in a lifetime at spit-Shining your shoes , and I 'm turning this much out in a day . You wanna hold one for a second ? - You threatened my wife , you scared my child ... you 're going down , zann . So help me god , you 're going down . Warren , romak , let 's go . [ chuckling ] - I thought you were gonna pop him might there . - Yeah . So did I. [ device beeping ] - Liz , knock it off . Liz , that 's enough ! - What ? Gosh , no one can do anything around here . - Liz , pick it up . It 's not yours , it 's Matt 's . - Liz . - Read your stupid book . - Liz . - Here , jerk face . - There are limits to my maturity . - Patrick , cut Liz some Slack . - Cut yourself some . - Meaning ? - She 's taking her cues from you . - Meaning ? - Stop being so strong for everybody . Let it go . - Coffee , lieutenant ? - Yeah , yeah . Run that sequence again . - Transmitting . - hold it- - Rerun . Enhance . Slow it down . Freeze . He only wanted the I.D. Because armored guards I.D.S are coded for vault entry . Zann 's going after the bank of altor . - It takes a lot more than an I.D. Card to get in , Brogan . In any case , I instructed central tracking to notify us if zann 's vessel moved . It did . It left altorian orbit at dawn . He 's gone . - No , I don 't believe he 's gone . It doesn 't make sense . - You scared him . He 's off to rob someplace else . - No , sir- - He 's gonna hit that bank . - I know you want him- - He threatened your family . But you have to let it go . Uh ... better have the bank cancel that I.D. , just in case- - Huh ? - Open , says me . - says me . - Ah . Put it there with Mr. Zann 's other strong box , will you ? That 's fine , boys . Thank you . - Thank you very much . - Ah , my pleasure , sir . And if you 'd like to come with me , we 'll pick up your deposit slip in my office . - Bank of altor . - Yeah , this is lieutenant Brogan , dcpd , I need to talk to the bank manager about a stolen I.D. - He 's away from his desk- - Would you like to hold ? - Oh , uh , thanks a lot , guys . You know where the docking bay is ? - Yeah . - Okay . - see you , Mr. Zann . - Open , says me . - I blew it- - Scared him off . - don 't let it eat ya- - Zann 'll get his . - Brogan , we 're registering a vault alarm . - Bank of altor . - Come on- - Quick , quick , move . Come on . Get them unloaded . Down here- - Down here . Come on , speed it up . Speed it up . - Oh , sorry , officers , we 've got it all under control . - Got what under control ? - Oh , just a false alarm . - Time Watts been screwed up- - It 's weird . Like it 's been tampered with from inside . - Zann 's in there . - Mr. Zann ? What are you talking about ? - Open it up . - Come on ! - Okay . - What in tarnation ? - Fredo , we 've got a live 620 here . Send backup now . - can you open it ? - Sure , this program will blow the locks and the doors will open automatically . - Then do it . - Takes 120 Unit seconds for the program to run . You ready , sir ? One , two , three , go ! - You know , something don 't add up here . - What do you mean ? - He didn 't use the machine to get in . And why would he trap himself like that ? - This is cold . - What do you mean cold ? - the door , it 's freezing . - can you check humidity inside this vault ? - Certainly . Current humidity zero- - That 's impossible . - because there 's no air in there . He didn 't use the machine to get in . He used it to get out . - What are you saying ? They 're going out the back way , pal . You got a big hole in your bank . Get outta here- - Move ! Come on , let 's go . Come on- - Come on . Come on- - Come on . - Rock snatcher , straight ahead . Man , if that thing gets up to speed it 's gone . - Well , I guess we 'll have to go along for the ride . Hang on , man . - Oh , jeez , Brogan . Now it gets dangerous . I hope there 's enough room for us here . - Now 's not a good time for guess work , partner . Tight parking spot . - Not as bad as New York . - Come on , baby , hold together . Don 't spring a Leak now . [ beeping ] - We got air- - Let 's go . Police , freeze- - Freeze ! - Ahhh ! - Ahhh ! - Give it up , zann . Zann , give it up ! - You give it up , Brogan ! Can you shoot a gun faster than I can twitch a finger ? I don 't think so . Now drop it . Better decide , time 's running out . - nail it , Brogan . - It 's homing in on the glove , zann . Drop the glove ! - No- - no ! No- - Ahhh ! - Brogan , it 's getting bigger ! - Shut off the machine ! It 's gonna breach the Hull ! Throw it in . Haldane ? You all right ? - Yeah . Just another day at the office . - Oh , man . Tell me again why I love this job ? - Hey , look who 's here . - Hey ! Way to go . All right , Brogan . - Captain , the bank of altor 's begun the transfer of the bullion . - Good- - the sooner the better . - You did real good , lieutenant . - Brogan- - Haldane ? I 'm putting you two in for a commendation . - All right . [ officers clapping ] - Well , thank you , sir- - That 's very kind of you . - Yes , it is . - Hey , the bank oughta give you guys a parade . - You know ... you 're lucky I still exist . - Haldane , if you didn 't exist I 'd have to invent you . [ plate Shattering ] [ plate Shattering ] - Ha , ha , ha . Oh boy , does that feel good . I 'm telling ya . [ plate Shattering ] here , try one . Just imagine that clown 's face on it . Go ahead- - Go ahead . [ plate Shattering ] Yeah . Let 's do it together . [ plates shattering ] no , no , I think I did . What did I call it ? I can 't remember . - Hi . - Hey , don 't look at me- - I 'm not cleaning anything up . - Have some ice cream . - We saved one for you .

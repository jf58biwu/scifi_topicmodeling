Uh , I 'm going to bum a cig . Like I said , my personal philosophy- - party big , party often . I 've always felt that way too . - Seven ? - Six . What good is life if you can 't have an occasional blow-out to break the high school grind ? Nothing . Boring . - Eight ? - Seven . And when you see a chance to party you got to go for it . - Live life on the edge . - All right ! Hi , boys . Having fun ? BOTH : 11 ! I want to take a time-out . You want to take a time-out ? Sure . I 'll take a time-out ... When I 'm dead . They say we can choose our classes but then they decide what classes we choose from .

This is a party . Check the ' tude at the door . Uh ... Listen , Wayne . Why don 't you pay a little attention to Marcia ? I think she wants to dance . Oh , Marcia . Of course she wants to dance . That 's how she 'd solve the world 's problems . Everybody dance . Oh . Hi . Enjoying the party ? - It 's sucks . - Ah , come on , it 's awesome . ( Sniffing ) Do I reek ? Or is that the quiche ? Um , it 's you . You worked up really kind of a big sweat there . - Oh , can I ? May I ? - Marcia , are you scamming on me ? Um ... maybe . - Would you like to dance ? - That 's not a very good idea . - Why not ? - Lots of reason- - It 's late , I 'm not a good dancer you 're Wyatt 's mom . I want to see you shake your tight little butt . Oh , Wayne , is that you ? I was having so much fun - I forgot you were here . - Hey , Wayne . How 's it go ... ? I see through your stupid little trick , Marica- your stupid little games . - This isn 't a game . And if you can 't pay attention to me I 'll just find some other guy who can . Go on . I 'm not stopping you . Please ... stop her . Man was never meant to be monogamous anyhow . What 's going on ? - Wayne and I are breaking up . - Breaking up ? Yeah . We 're dust . We 're history- - - A footnote in ... - Oh , shut up . All you ever do is talk . I need someone who knows how to party- - someone like ... Gary . - I can explain . - Hey , hey . Looks like you 're going to get some tonight . Wa ! Wa ! Wa ! Help me with this . Did my parents 26-years marriage just dissolve because of your tight butt ? Don 't underestimate the power of this butt . When it speaks , chicks listen . Like I said , there 's something I wanted to ask you and I 've thought a bunch about it and , well ... - These words don 't come easy . - Yes , Al ? Will you have sex with me ? Al , how many times do I have to tell you that I 'm not ready for sex ? Well , it 's okay . I 'm ready enough for both of us . You 're such an idiot . ( Sobbing ) So , what 's your answer ? ( Knock at Door ) Emily , may I come in ? - He 's a pig . - He 's a guy . What am I supposed to do ? Al just wants to have sex , but I 'm not ready to and I don 't want to lose him to some slutty senior . Trust me . I don 't think you 're going to lose him . - He 's such a tasty stud . - Emily , the two of you have a very special chemistry that no one else would ever want a part of . - You really think so ? - I know so . No one wants to take Al away . Trust me . ( Making Raspberry Noises ) Hey . Playing hendrix ? - No , just arm farting ' the blues . - You are one talented man , Al . - So- - - Where 's Emily ? Ah , she blew me off . - What happened ? - I don 't know what her deal is . All night long , this chick 's coming on to me big time making moves . I ask her to have sex , and she freaks . - She bailed on you ? - Yeah . Looks like I 'm back on the market again , huh ? Hey , know any slutty seniors you can set me up with ? What are you , nuts ?

Let 's tour your room so I can choose the things you 're going to give me for not narking to Dad . I don 't think Dad really cares . Dad , you 're home . I swear I just stepped out for two minutes . I had nothing to do with this . WAYNE : Too bad , man . You missed a killer party . Later . - Where you going ? - I don 't know . Thought I 'd Hitchhike to Cabo and then after that , down to South America and then after that ... who knows ? Whoa , wait a minute . I ... you 're leaving ? You can 't leave . Who 's going to buy the food and pay for my car insurance ? WYATT : You don 't know what you 're doing . You 're not thinking straight . He 's leaving . - You got to stop him . - What for ? It 's over between us . - Huh ? - Besides , I 've got all the man I want right here . GARY : What can I say ? She digs me . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! You are not Hitchhiking anywhere . You 're going to end up face down somewhere in a ditch . - I ... I forbid it . - Yeah . Right . Who need you , Wayne ? I 'm going after him . You touch my mom and you 're dead . Come on , let 's find an empty room . Whoa ! Hold on . Dad 's ... Hitchhiking to Cabo ... and you 're dating Gary . What kind of psycho nerve gas have you been sucking back ? Oh . I got it . This is one of those screwy , mid-life , hormone ... chick things , isn 't it ? No . It 's a butt thing . ( Stifled Whimper ) What the hell is happening here ? My family is falling apart in front of my face . I 'm so confused . The pizza guy 's confused . Get his gun ! RADIO D.J. : It 's 6 : 15 ! What a morning ! Whoo ! Yes ! Faster , man , faster . Have you ever thought about what you 're doing to do in Mexico ? Get off my back . You sound just like my dad . Okay , fine . You want to go to Mexico ? Go ahead . Walk . Cool . That would have worked on me . You can 't go to Mexico . You have too many responsibilities . Who are you talking to ? We 're fifteen . We don 't have responsibilities . Tag along with me , man . It will be awesome . You got the convertible . Hey , we can be sipping margaritas by sunset . Hey , he who hesitates is lunch , man . What the hell ? Let 's go !

 [ â ™ ª music â ™ ª ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on earth found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent ... he learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind He is Superboy . [ â ™ ª music â ™ ª ] This has been a colossal waste of time . Nothing like fresh air and a little exercise . Even if we didn 't see a whippoorwill or whatever . Will o ' the wisp . Flickering lights seen mostly at night . I know , Lana . And mostly over marshy ground . Also known as burning swamp gas . This wasn 't anywhere near a swamp . It was seen by a reliable witness , and it was in broad daylight . [ rattle ] Did you hear something ? Shhh . I think it 's just your imagination . Nothin ' much going on around here . So , why 'd you come if you weren 't interested ? 'Cause I didn 't like the idea of you tromping through this kind of countryside by yourself . And you wanted to protect me ? Well it can get pretty wild out here . Clark . It 's not that I don 't appreciate the thought . But I am capable of taking care of myself . You know we probably should be heading back soon . It 's already 2 : 30 . I 'm not giving up . If we find whatever this thing is , we could rack up some major points , back at the Bureau . What are you looking at ? Out there on the horizon . I don 't . I don 't see anything , Clark . I , I ... I thought I saw ... Oh , my , God . This must be it . It 's heading this way , Clark . Lana , get back . [ screams ] [ yelling ] Lana ? Lana ? If you can hear me , blink your eyes . Please be OK . I better get a doctor . Listen . It happened to everyone . Except to me . Can you hear me ? Can anybody hear me ? Hello . Hello ! That 's what time it was when I left Lana . It hasn 't stopped . It 's just been slowed down . It 's all been slowed down . They 're not frozen . They 're just moving in slow motion . Wait a minute . If the blades aren 't turning fast enough to hold it up , how What if it isn 't them ? What if it 's me ? They haven 't slowed down . I 've been sped up . That 's why they can 't see me or hear me . I 'm moving too fast . And what if I can never get back . This has to be the effect of the will o ' wisp . It has to . But how ? Why ? You 're headed for an accident . [ phone rings ] Hello . Is anybody here ? [ phone ringing ] Hello . Is someone there ? Hello ! What 's going on ? ! It 's moving . And it 's real . Who 's doing this ? Where are you ? [ tires screeching ] Nothing seems to affect him . I wonder why he changed his clothing , I don 't know . Appears we have a lot more to learn about these beings . Maybe ... Maybe we should try somewhere else . No . We 're running out of time . In a little while , we 're going to be I said no . This place is perfect . The yellow sun , the mixture of ultraviolet and infrared , Look . We 'll all being rejuvenated here . We 'll all be killed . You 're afraid of him aren 't you ? I 'm being careful , that 's all . But what about you ? What do you mean ? You and him . It 's personal now isn 't it ? Dear Lord , it 's happened to you too . - Who are you ? - My name 's John . It 's so good to see another human being . Especially one that 's moving around . Yes it is . Any idea how this happened ? I don 't know , but I think someone sped me up to to try to isolate me , to kill me . Kill you ? My god , why ? I 'm not sure , but maybe they 're after you , too . Oh me ? I didn 't do anything to anybody . All the same , I 'd like to get you someplace safe . I think I know just the place . We were married in here . We 'd come every Sunday . And the Mill closed and most of the congregation just left town , I still come back here now and then . Lots of memories ? Yeah . But none of them with any future . There 's got to be some way to get out of here . Not for me . Doesn 't really matter . Been a long time since anybody even noticed I was gone . How about you ? Anyone special . Sort of . And you 're concerned about her ? There were a few things I would have wanted to have told her . She must be important to you . Let 's just say , the thought of never seeing her again is difficult for me to accept . Whoever 's doing this must be after something . But what ? [ laughter ] [ gunshots ] I think it is quite obvious . What are you doing ? I 'm killing you . [ laughs ] What are you ? A robot . Who sent you ? Why are they trying to kill me ? You have been quite lucky . But the tests to come , will not be so easy . Tests ? What kind of tests ? You will never beat us . You will never beat us . No one can . No one can . None of you . None of you . None of you . None of you . None of us ? That was pointless . No it wasn 't . I know exactly what to do with him now . But we can 't stay in the acceleration mode much longer . Just a little more time . That 's all I need . If we don 't make it back home , they won 't go ahead with the colonization . Relax . Enjoy the light . Help . Somebody help me . Clark ? Clark ? Clark . Clark ? Superboy . Let her go . We 've come a long way for this . The heat . The light . Our planet has almost none anymore . But this one does . And now it 's ours . You were the cause of this ? Who are you ? We 're your new masters . I wouldn 't count on that . I would . We 've got her , remember ? I said , let her go . She 's ours . Unless . Unless , what ? Unless you surrender to us . Tests . Give up , or we 'll leave with her . Go ahead . What ? You 'll never see her again . That 's just something I 'll have to live with . But I don 't ever give up . None of us do . See how much stronger they 've gotten since the last time . You 're lying . We 've seen you try to protect others . But never to the point of surrender . For us that 's the ultimate humiliation . Please . Don 't leave me . Nearly out of time . We 've got to get out of the acceleration mode . - Why did you let her go ? - It 's over . Our time 's up . How , how could you do this to me ? They were testing me , looking for weaknesses , I 'm sorry . Yeah . I , I ... I figured that out , too . I think they still have Clark . I know you have a weakness . We 'll be back for more tests later . Let 's go while they 've given us the chance . No you won 't . You wanted to test a typical human being to see if you could win a war with us . But you couldn 't find any weaknesses , because there aren 't any . We 're all like me . Some are even stronger . You 're lucky you didn 't take Lana . Yeah . Better we shouldn 't go back , not like this . You killed us . They thought you were typical human ? How did you figure it out ? The robot didn 't recognize me . He kept saying " None of you " as if I were typical . Later . [ yells ] [ explosion ] Hey , are you OK ? I just looked away for a second . It was like you came out of nowhere . What about Superboy ? Superboy ? All I saw was you . That 's funny . Lana , where 've you been ? I 've been looking all over for you . Me , well where were you ? You 're not going to believe what just happened . I saw another one of those will o ' the wisps . And I went after it . Then I got lost . Say , listen . Can I give you folks a lift somewhere or Yeah . Um , we got to get back to the Bureau Thanks . My protector . Lana . I can 't be everywhere at once . No , I suppose you can 't . [ man ] So , uh , what 's this Bureau thing ? [ â ™ ª music â ™ ª ]

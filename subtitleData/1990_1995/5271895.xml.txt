 Pull . Pull hard . Pull ! You need a hand up there ? Hey , kid . Wanna give me a hand ? What can I do ? Come here , and I 'll show you . Ready ? All right . Okay ? All right . All right . All righty . Here you go . There . Now - How 's it fit ? Can you reach the pedals ? Recon rail 's your top priority , friend . I thought everybody should be mobile . That 's a good idea . All righty . She 's not much to look at , but a boy 's gotta have wheels , right ? Hey , what 'd you think ? I was gonna carry you around everywhere ? Nah , this 'll be fine . Okay . This here 's the brake . It makes you stop . Press this , that makes you go . This is where you steer . That-a-boy . Steer it like that . You have any trouble gettin ' it started , you just jiggle that a little bit and spit on it . All right ? All right . Give it a shot . All right . Take it easy now . Okay . All right . That 's good , that 's good . Just take your time . You 're doin ' good . Just take your time . All right . That-a-boy ! Whoo ! Go , go , go ! That-a-boy ! Don 't forget to steer ! It 's all gone , Yale . Everything . Not everything , Devon . Most of our vehicles , communications equipment . Something 's out there , Yale , and it 's cleaned us out . We were perhaps foolish to believe there was no intelligent life here . I know . I just don 't know what to do now . People are injured . O 'Neill wants to follow those tracks , hunt down whatever creature stole our cargo . That might be imprudent , Devon . I 'm just worried about what might be out there . Here , kitty , kitty . Here , kitty , kitty . What 's out there is two tons of supplies and equipment , Devon , and it 's nothing more than shiny beads and trinkets to some stunted , tri-toed hominids . I don 't mean to second-guess you , Broderick , but I don 't think this - Then don 't ! It 's ours , Devon . We have every right to go out and hunt it down . True ? You ready to roll ? Can you bring me over a bypass hookup relay ? Ye-Yeah . Just be careful . Okay , Uly . Keep breathing . And give us your best shot . Not bad . Good job , Uly . Good peak . My personal best ? Almost . Let me see you drive this thing , okay ? Why don 't you go down to that tree and back ? - Time me . - Okay . Be careful . Well , he 's no worse , considering all he 's been through . It 's not a miracle , but it 's something . All I want is to give him a chance . Nothing today suggests you can 't . Nothin ' for miles . No movement . Nothing . These tracks head in 10 different directions . We won 't be bested by this . What ? Hey . Maybe we oughta hold off a little . If I wanted to hold off , I 'd stayed on the station . - Commander , we don 't know what we 're dealing with ! - I know it fired my ri " fl " e , don 't I ? You all right ? Yeah . My God . Yeah . Just stings like a son of a - That little bugger 's got a - He 's got a - Hey . Commander ! Hey ! Oh , my God ! Oh , no , don 't . No , don 't do this ! O 'Neill ! Oh , my God . Forgive us , Lord , if this ceremony lacks grace . Burial is a tradition long lost to us over generations in space . Bless our brother , Broderick O 'Neill . Be gracious to him . Lift up countenance upon him and grant him peace . Universe to universe , ashes to ashes , dust to dust . And remember to your heart our lost brethren , with whom we set forth on this mission . Protect them from evil . Amen . Children ? - I am sorry to have frightened you . - I don 't scare . - Didn 't scare me . You want to talk about what happened to Commander O 'Neill ? He 's dead . Why are they putting him into the dirt ? Come . Come , come . Sometimes we need to return to the place we think we have come from . Earth , even this new Earth , can be a place where - where life begins . And when life ends , it can be a place to rest . Are we all gonna go in the dirt , Yale ? No . No . Not for a very long time . But we have to be very careful . We are in a new place now . Everything is different . Commander O 'Neill died because he forgot that - that even a little animal , as cute as can be , can be deadly here . You understand ? Okay . Now , I expect that if either of you see anything like this , you will stay far , far away . I will . I promise . Uh-huh . Me too . Far , far away . We dropped our communication dish here . Cargo was due to land here . But the other 15 pods could be anywhere . Sweetheart , get me a number-nine anthro-scepter . So you know , I am equipped with a variety of scepters and retractors . He 's not interested . Here you go , Dad . Uh , no . Number nine , okay ? Well , that settles it then . I think once we get the vehicles operational , we should head out . Mm-hmm . We wanted to be pioneers , Yale . We 've come this far . Dad ? We 're not gonna be able to go home , are we ? Excuse me . You just can 't go - Excuse me . Am I hearing this right ? Are you planning a trip or something ? We 're charting our way to New Pacifica , where we dropped our communications dish . Give me a minute with your boss here , will ya ? It 's okay . I 'm a good guy . You 're crazier than I 'd heard . You can 't just drag this group across whatever land mass this is . Half of us weren 't even supposed to set foot on this planet . And I 'm sorry for that . But we didn 't come this far to stop now . What are you , in shock , Adair ? We have crashed onto this planet . We have lost most of our cargo . I just saw a man get killed by a rodent , for crying out loud . Maybe you haven 't noticed it , but your plans have changed . New Pacifica is not the priority anymore . It certainly is a priority for 248 families on our colony ship . Twenty-six months from now they 'll be here , and I 've promised them a fully operational outpost . That 's your mission , lady . That 's " your " mission . Half of us are hired hands here . You read the risk disclosure when you took this job , and you were paid four times the standard cryo-sleep rate . And don 't you dare invoke Broderick O 'Neill 's death here . The man was my friend . It 's not about contracts or friendship . It is about survival . You want to move on ? I say you put it to a vote . Thanks for your advice , Mr " . - " Danziger . What I really need right now is a Trans Rover that 's operational . Think you can handle that ? Oh , my God . ! - On the ridge , - " What is that ? Uly ? Uly , where are you ? Mom ? I 'm right here , Mom . Come here , baby . Lock . Secure . Voice print . My order . Stay in there . Don 't open it . What ? What is it ? Some sort of biped creatures . Oh , my God . Zero , are you there ? No indication of alien bipeds . Still no indication . But they were just there , Zero . I am scanning movement over the ridge . I am picking up movement over the ridge . I 'm picking up two meters per second of motion . Two beings . Scanning at 1,700 meters . Two biped creatures . - What is it ? - " I have them in range now . " They are on approach . Visual feed . They are alive . Boy , that was bedlam , wasn 't it ? When that ship started going down , us in the clutches of gravity like that , my first thought was , you know , we 're gonna be dead . Oh . ! Real food . Mmm . ! You don 't know the sick feeling I had , Morgan and me waiting and ... the wind shear just loppin ' us right off . Oh , yeah . And the thought that we would never see any of you again - And if somebody had been trying to get in , when that auto air lock snapped shut , boy , that just would 've been - Oh , that was just - that - that was hell . Does anyone want to talk about what we saw today ? Thought we all agreed they were animals . Animals don 't carry staffs . None that we know of . Maybe it was an illusion . Tips of the rocks - What about the light ? Sun " fl " ares is just not a good-enough explanation . Let 's not make any assumptions . There 's a lot we don 't know about this place . Fine time to realize that . I 'm not supposed to . They said you 're too dangerous . What the hell ? What the hell ? What are you ? What do you want ? What was that ? Who said that ? What was that ? Who said that ? What is this place ? What is this place ? Please stop . What are you ? Please stop . What are you ? Leave me ! I don 't have dreams . I don 't have dreams . You 're all right . Alonzo ? Okay , okay , okay . You can 't stay with us anymore . Good-bye . Go on . Good-bye . What are you doing here ? Is that one of those things that killed the commander ? Just-Just go back to camp . You 're not supposed to be out here . Yeah ? Neither are you . And those things are evil . Yale told us to stay away from them . She 's not evil " . You 're " evil ! It 's your fault you got sick and we had to come here in the first place . You 're gonna get us all killed by those things . I 'm gonna tell . No , you 're not . Hey , let go of me ! It is your fault ! Let go ! No ! Just stop ! - Aah ! Let go of me ! - Don 't ! Stop ! Look out ! We 're gonna crash ! Uly ? Hey ! Uly ? Uly , where are you ? Uly ? Uly ? Uly ? I 'm coming . ! True , is that you ? True , is that you ? Uh - Uh - Hey ! Help ! - Uly ! - Help ! This quadrant 's clear . I 'm gonna go check the ridge over here . Uly ? Uly , where are you ? Come on , Uly . Uly , answer me ! Uly ! Zero , how much further ? I have a gear reading at approximately one half meter . What - Yeah . Yeah . I got him . Yeah , this is him . I think I see him . Yeah , I got him . I got him . ! Devon . Devon . Devon ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's okay . Shh , shh . It 's all right . We 're just going about this wrong , that 's all . There 's gotta be a way in . All right , we need everyone out of here . I 'll stay here with Zero , but that 's it . Everybody else goes back to camp . I 'm not going anywhere . Hey . We 'll find your kid . Just leave me some supplies . I know how to respirate . I 'm not leaving until we find him . Okay . Keep in contact over gear . If you lose us , if you hear anything at all happen to us , pull up stakes and get the hell away from here as fast as possible . You understand me ? All right . Let 's go . People , I may have found something here . Sixty-three meters , exactly . Sensors indicate a large labyrinth-like system . Will a man fit down there ? Yes . But as a Zero unit , I come with a variety of excavation accessories . Of course , they were all stolen . I 'll have you on gear the whole time , let you know everything I see . Pal , you hear me start screaming in terror , you take that as your cue to yank me out of here . Without fail , sir . Zero ? Can you track me down here ? Sir , I have excellent tracking capabilities . How 's it going there , little girl ? I 'm fixing the Trans Rover . Anything I can do to help ? My name is Bess . We haven 't met yet . What 's your name ? True . And , no ... there 's nothing you can do to help . It 's not your fault , True . We 're gonna find Uly . We 're all in this together . Oh , no . They 're back . Oh , Lord . Morgan . Well ? What are you all waiting for ? Them to kill us too ? What is he doing ? Morgan , just be careful , okay ? Just - Morgan ? Morgan ! Well , there ya go . Show these things who 's boss on this planet . You idiot ! Hey , where you goin ' ? Uly . ! Uly ? Can you hear me ? This is amazing . It 's an old underground river , or an abandoned mine . Any sign ? Footprints ? Signs of struggle ? Nothing . Like it 's been empty forever . Julia ! Julia ! It 's-It 's Alonzo . He keeps calling for you . Come on . Alonzo ? You all right ? They 're Terrians . What ? They 're " Terrians " ? What did you say ? The creatures - the ones who swim up from the earth . Alonzo , are you with me ? How do you know what they 're called ? Because I talked to them . I talked to them . Devon , go back to camp and get some rest . I 'll stay . Twenty-two light-years for this . I haven 't given up hope yet . And I know you haven 't either . We 'll find him . What was I thinking , Yale ? Why did I bring all these people here ? You did not bring them , Devon . They followed you . Two hundred and fifty families still out in space will tell you that in person ... when they reach this planet . I don 't know . Maybe we had no right , Yale . Maybe we 're not supposed to go to the end of the universe to save ourselves . Maybe ... we just haven 't gotten there yet . Devon ? Are you there ? I 'm on . What is it ? I think we have a way . What are you talking about ? Uly . I think we know who or what has him . We might be able to reach him . I 'm not saying I 'm sure it 's gonna work , but I think it makes the most sense . The soil on the ridge was disrupted , just like it is over here . I think they 're trying to approach us through Alonzo 's dreams . A - And you think they 're gonna try and reach us again ? I don 't know for sure . All we can do is put Alonzo to sleep and try . Hey , all I said is , I saw them in a dream . - Uly was not taken in a dream . - Guys , you up there ? What ? What is it ? I think I 'm into something here . Whoever lives down here , I don 't think it 's animals . Okay , so what are we gonna do ? I 'm going after him . I 'll take the sedative . I 'm not just sitting and waiting . I don 't have any other choice . Devon ! No REM . Alonzo , this isn 't right . They approached you . You have to go with her . Uly ! Uly . ! Uly ! Uly ! I 'm here , Devon . I 'm here . My son . Where is he ? What have you done with him ? Mom ? I assume you know the risks a child like Ulysses faces going into cold sleep . I 'm aware of the risks . But we don 't have much choice , now , do we ? I love you , Mom . Uly ? Mom ? Mom ! Mom ! They fear us . They 're confused by us . Why ? Why are they doing this ? They 're aware Uly is special , different . The abduction is an attempt to understand us through him . This dream plane is real . It is the only way they can reach us . Uly ! Uly ! Uly ? Uly ! Uly ! Uly ! Uly ! They claim we 've been here before , this planet . What ? What are they talking about ? We 've never been here before . Never ! They fear we 're evil . We 've left our mark on the planet already . No , we came here for life , for a chance to live . No , we came here for life , for a chance to live . Uly 's return is not a gift . It would have a price . Wh-What is it ? Tell us what it is . Anything . ! Devon - Devon , it 's not our fight . I don 't care . I will do anything . I will give you my life for my son 's . Please . Devon , it is different for them . What are they doing ? Tell them to stop ! My son ! My son . ! What ? What do you want ? What are you asking ? Uly ! Uly . Man ! Oh , boy . Come here . Devon , how you feeling ? You all right ? What happened ? I don 't know . Well , where are you going ? Devon ? Mom ! Uly . ! I 'm right here , Mom ! I 'm okay . Oh ! Uly ! Are you okay ? Oh , God . Oh , my baby . If we can average 20 kilometers a day , we can make it to New Pacifica in nine months - or at least what we used to think of as months - and we will still have 17 months to prepare for our colonists . It won 't be easy , and I don 't understand this new world better than any of you , but I know New Pacifica is here , and I know somehow we 'll be all right there . I think we 've all seen something here that can help us believe that . So that 's it . You think we should just take off . Just like that . No . I think we should take a vote . We came to this planet a group of strangers , and now we head out , still strangers , but united toward a single purpose - braving this new land . Four days ago , aliens landed on a distant planet , and we are them . Now we struggle across an unknown planet , an uncharted world , looking all the while for that moment when we must fulfill our promise ... and wondering ... what will stand in our way . I don 't know , Devon . I don 't know what kind of promise we made , what kind of price we 're gonna have to pay . I don 't either , but I know I 'd make it again .

 You got something for an old lady ? Well , give it to me . The crystal has traveled thousands of Miles through the pyrenees mountains and the Congo . There have been many risks . I put a great value on my life . Give it to me . Where the rest you filthy old hag ? No one cheats me . You should learn to respect your elders . Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ! Oo ... Woo hoo , woo hoo . Ah , what a warm roof for the homeless will do . Business before pleasure , my pets . The last of the crystals of the ancient druid priests . At last my years of searching are finally over . Haven 't I told you never to touch without asking ? Each crystal has a power of its own but the ultimate power belongs to whoever can fuse all the crystals into one . How are you going to do it , Tiger Eye ? It takes temperatures greater than the sun . I don 't get it . How are you going to go there ? When genetics gave you that gorgeous body , I guess something had to be missing . The answer is right here in our own backyard . Superboy . Yes , that 's right ; he could do it with his heat vision . Yes and I have studied that gorgeous hunk of man . But come on , you could never get Superboy to help you . Denny , you talk too much . Now , we 're just going to have to do something about that , aren 't we ? Poor , poor Denny . Now ... back to the fun . How am I to my plan to get this gorgeous Superboy to do my bidding ? All I need is this Lana Lang girl to do it . And ... Superboy is mine . Lana ? Listen , I know you probably think that I 'm not really interested in art and the only reason I 'm doing this is to see all the foxy models posing in the buff , but it 's not true . Well , I believe anyone can experience an artistic awakening and learn to really appreciate the beauty in life . Yeah , yeah , that 's exactly it , it 's the awakening thing . That 's why I transferred from meteorology to life drawing . Andy , you 're gonna love it . The human body is a beautiful thing . Absolutely . Have you ever seen such a body so perfectly sculpted ? Look at those supple muscles . Aren 't you inspired ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . Um , listen , Lana , just between you and me you know artist to artist when do you think we 'll draw females ? Oh , didn 't I tell you ? That 's next semester . Oh . Nice work . Oh ! I didn 't mean to startle you . What are you doing here ? I need to ask you a favor . I was wondering if you could cover my history class for me ? I 'm not going to be able to make it . I have to cover that museum opening that Superboy 's gonna be at . I 'll see you guys later . - Bye . - See ya . This is the third time in two weeks I 've covered for you so you could go out and do a story on Superboy . I really appreciate it . Clark , you 're hopeless . What am I gonna do with you ? Excuse me , I 'd like to talk to you . Me ? Oh , ah , oh , sure I 'd like to talk to you , too . Bye , Clark . All right , now let 's just get out of these clothes . The students are waiting . Come on . But you don 't understand ! Oh , relax . You 'll get used to everybody watching you naked . Uh , Lana , where are you going ? She has a date with me . Yeah , I have a date with him . What about your midterm ? Why don 't we get rid of him ? Okay , bye-bye . But ... Ah ! Oh , he go swoosh . Excuse me . Clark ? Look out for the car ! Clark , are you okay ? Yeah , yeah , just a few bruises . Under the trance she told us this Clark Kent guy knows how to contact Superboy . She gave us Kent 's number . Where am I ? My , my , my , what a pretty young thing . Too bad you 're not going to grow up to be old . I don 't know what it is you want but when Superboy finds out I 'm missing he 'll come after you . Yes , he will won 't he ? Especially since I intend to extend him a personal invitation . What are you talking about ? Oh , we are curious aren 't we ? I 'm going to ask Superboy to do me a little itty bitty favor . Oh , no . You 're not gonna use me as bait . I already have . You know , you remind me a lot of me when I was your age . Feisty with a temperament like a , like a snake . Yes , yes , a snake . It would be very , very fitting . What are you doing ? My , how I love cold slithery wicked things . Clark , she hasn 't called or anything . I 'm worried . - Hello . - Clark ? Lana ! You 've got to help . Where are you ? Are you all right ? Where is she ? I 'm in trouble , Clark . I got away from them long enough to call . You 've got to find Superboy . I 'm in an underground lab beneath the Old Industrial Park . Under the old kenson building , I know where that is . Don 't worry , Lana . I 'll find him . What ? Andy , you stay here in case she calls back . Wait , I 'm coming with ... What 's with this door ? Ow , oh , ow ! Whoa ! Okay , all right . Hah ! Aw , not hungry ? Guess you still prefer filet mignon , huh ? Ah ! Oo hoo . Oo hoo . Hmm . Where 's Lana ? How impatient you are , Superboy . Come on , Lana . Come and say hello to your hero . Yes . I think you two should meet again . Snake , this is Superboy . Superboy , this is snake . What is this some kind of joke ? No , no , no joke . This is a snake and her name is Lana Lang . Not as attractive as she once was but she 'll make a wonderful pet . How could you turn Lana into a snake ? Oh , it 's very simple if you have the answers . And the crystal . Now ... do you believe me ? What do you want from me ? I want you to do a very simple task . I need you to fuse all the crystals together into one . Not a chance . Now , this is acid . Don 't make me do something that you 'll regret . Please , fuse them ? Fuse them . For centuries the great alchemists have sought to create the greatest most powerful crystal of all . They always failed . But now , thanks to you , Superboy , it belongs to me . Maybe not . Now , you appreciate power , Superboy . You can realize why only you remain a threat to me . Go ahead , Tiger Eye , finish him off ! No , I think you need to go back to the way you were . I thought you needed me . Need ? I need no one now . I 'll miss him . You 're a man of power . I 'm a woman of passion . Together we can rule the world . Join me , Superboy . Forget it . You can 't resist . After all , it was your power that created the crystal . Come on , join me . Come with me , Superboy . I 'm yours , Tiger Eye . Let 's go somewhere remote , somewhere we can plan our conquest of the world . I know a place near Shuster Gardens . Let 's fly there together . Lana ? Hi , Lana , it 's just me . Okay , come on , babe . We gotta get out of here . Oo ... You never really hugged me like that when you were a girl did you ? Appreciate the affection but just go out with me when this is all done . Well , let 's get to the park . Oo , you do know how to please a girl . I don 't know how we 're going to help , Superboy . You 're a snake . And I 've only got a C average . The park , pull over . Ordinary coal ... Is now a diamond . Oo , how nice and so simple . What do we have here ? Serpent in our garden ? Superboy is mine now . It 's now or never , Superboy . Snap out of it , Superboy . It 's mine . We 've got to stop her ! This little romance is over , Tiger Eye . I don 't think so . You have a strange way of showing affection . Well , you know what they say about a woman scorned . You had your chance . My heart is turned to ice and so will you . Well , good-bye , my love . Parting is such sweet sorrow . Superboy , catch ! There 's no telling what those new crystals 'll do . I just hope there 's a way to bring Lana back . All right , Superboy , that must have broken the spell ! No ! All my crystals ! No ! Wow . I guess those new crystals did that to her . At least she 's still alive . Hey , isn 't that that guy that she turned into a vulture ? They 're together now . I 'd better dispose of these . Well , Lana , what did it feel like to be a snake ? Probably no different than being Andy McAlister . Captioned by Grant Brown

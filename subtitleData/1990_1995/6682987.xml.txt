I 'm always late . Mr. Gunther doesn 't mind . Well , I mind . You 're never going to get anywhere in life unless you start taking some responsibility for yourself . Do something productive . Hey , I 'm doing all right , so far . God , I 'll never make it . If you want a ride you better get ready right now . All right , mellow out . DJ : You wanna keep it down out there ? I 'm trying to sleep . But seriously folks , we got a real racket comin ' at you now from the boys down at Mute Jam Records ... Seymour and the New Mutants singing " Baby , You 've Changed . " - Where 's Dad ? - Lay it on me ! What do you mean , where 's Dad ? Isn 't he in bed ? Nope . His car 's not there . You sure he 's not in his room ? I may not be a college girl like you , but I 'm not an idiot . He 's not in bed . I wonder where he could be . We 've got to do something . Call someone in . Nancy , you 're not thinking logically . We 're fully prepared to handle this situation within Talos . But this situation is out of control . He 's killed two people already and now he 's disappeared . He couldn 't have gotten out of the complex . He has to be somewhere in the building . I 've got two men searching for him right now . I don 't want him killed . Elliot and I have devised a way to get him back to normal . I won 't stand for it . Do you hear me ? Sit down , Doctor . What would you have me do ? Call in the police ? Or better yet , the National Guard ? I 'm not sure they would share the compassion and understanding you feel for Dr. Foster . They don 't share the same romantic past as you and he . You saw what that creature is capable of . That creature is still Michael Foster . - I 'm doing what I can . - It 's not enough , damn it ! What about Elliot ? What about John Griffen ? What are you going to do about them ? That has already been taken care of . You 're a cold bastard . ( intercom buzzing ) Yes ? Send them in . I 'll ignore that last remark , Doctor . Now you know as well as I that this entire project has been highly illegal from the start . And you have been a willing part of it . I feel terrible about what has happened . But we must keep this within the family or everything we 've done and learned will be for nothing . Michael Foster will be worse off than he is now . Please , trust me . ( knocking ) Come . Mitchell , Jarrett , this is Dr. Kane . Nancy , I think you 'd better explain to these gentlemen exactly what 's going on . Um , Doctor , I don 't think we should explain ... It 's all right , Doctor . They 've a level six clearance . They answer only to myself . Proceed . As I 'm sure you 're aware , a number of research and development programs here at Talos are subsidized by the government . Some , how shall I say it ... do not exactly fall within the safety guidelines and regulations outlined and normally enforced by the government , particularly in the field of nuclear research and genetics . A few months ago , Talos was assigned a research grant by the Defense Department ... a very strange request . We were given tissue samples , alien tissue samples . - Alien ? - Yes , alien . From another planet , apparently . We were skeptical ourselves . They were vague , almost tight-lipped about the sample 's origin . Which led us to suspect it was , in fact , some genetically-altered biological substance from Earth . If that was the case , why would they tell you it came from another planet ? We thought perhaps they developed this material for biological warfare and were using Talos to test what would be their alibi . This type of biological engineering is expressly forbidden under the UN germ warfare pact . If they could fool Talos into believing that the origin of this material was , in fact , from outer space , they could fool anyone and avoid ... Avoid indictment for violation of the pact . Exactly . Unfortunately , they were not lying . Dr. Michael Foster , head of the entire genetic research sector , was put in charge ... myself , as Dr. Foster 's assistant , and Dr. Viallini being the only three people with any knowledge of the research . Our problem started on May 4th , approximately 6 : 45 p.m. Michael was working with some cell cultures from the alien tissue . ( harpsichord music playing on headphones ) Computer : Containment seal secure , all functions normal . - Guess who ? - Ahh ! Don 't do that to me . Don 't tell me the doctor 's actually getting - paranoid about his little monsters . - ( music shuts off ) You 're a little monster . Come here . Please , dear , not in front of the mutants . Computer : Cryo-interlock engaged . Are we still on for dinner tonight ? I don 't know what time I 'm going to be getting out of here . Hello , Checkers . Hello , baby . Hello . - ( screams ) - ( growling ) Well , Checkers is certainly energetic today . Mm-hmm . Computer : Intermediate microbe distention filter ... - at 98 % . - How far have you gotten ? Well , I 'm introducing some of the alien cell cultures into Spot 's ovaries . The problem is , I can 't find any plasmas in the alien cells . There do not appear to be any structures that contain identifiable genetic material . How can the cells replicate if there 's no genetic code ? As far as I can tell , the cells don 't reproduce by fission as normal cells do . They seem to accumulate polyp-like growths which just mass together to form tissue . I don 't think even using the term " cell " is applicable . I tell you , Nancy , I 'm stumped . Well , you better get un-stumped . Viallini wants a report by the end of the week . - Well , you can tell Viallini ... - Hey ... You can tell him whatever you want . I 've got to go . ( screaming ) Michael ! - Oh God ! - Michael ! Computer : Emergency alert . Emergency alert . Biological contamination . Quarantine restriction code seven . - Oh , shit ! - Michael ! - Are you all right ? - Oh my God ! The cells ! Michael , what do we do ? Michael , what do we do ? Nancy , come here . Hurry ! - Pour this on my hand ! - Michael , that 's sulfuric acid ! Damn it , don 't argue with me ! Just do it ! Do you think that did it ? I don 't know . Oh my God . Michael ! Oh , shit ! Michael ! Michael ! Elliot ! Elliot ! Please answer . - Computer : Emergency alert . - Please ! Emergency alert . Biological contamination . Quarantine restriction code seven . Elliot . Dr. Elliot Stein ? Yes , Elliot ... Dr. Stein is staff physician ... Dr. Elliot Stein : Age 33 ; single ; father dead ; mother still alive , living in Chaplin , Nebraska ; graduate , Harvard Medical , class of ' 77 . Stein is staff physician , assistant to Dr. Marcus , head of pharmaceutical and chemical research . Yes , that Dr. Stein . May I continue ? Thank God Elliot was still there . You know , I usually don 't make house calls . He was working on one of the mutants and it bit him . Michael , can you hear me ? Michael ! Michael ! Elliot , he was working with some really strange cell cultures . They got into his ... Holy Jesus . What the hell was he working with ? Elliot , they were cell samples from another planet . What ? ! The cells come from a creature from another planet . Nancy , have you been drinking ? Elliot , don 't argue with me . I know it sounds crazy , but it 's true . The cells come from a ... I don 't have time to stand here and explain this to you . Just help him ! From another planet ? Elliot ! All right , all right . Jesus Christ , cells from outer space . I outta change my name to Dr. McCoy . Have you noticed any pods ? Elliot ! I 'm sorry , it 's just ... - I don 't know where to start . - ( growling ) Elliot ! Elliot ! Nancy , come here . Help me . Hold that in . You gotta hold him steady . I 'll give him a sedative . ( growling stops ) Help me get him up . We 've got to get him to a hospital . That will not do , Dr. Stein . Dr. Viallini , we 've got to get Michael to a hospital . That won 't be necessary , Doctor . We have the facilities here to deal with this situation . I don 't mean to disagree , Doctor , but this man has got to be ... Dr. Kane will explain to you why it is imperative that we deal with this problem within the confines of this establishment . Nancy . Naturally , I explained the ... situation to Dr. Stein and he apparently agreed that we should keep it ... in the family . I 'm sure whatever Dr. Viallini is using to black ... was using to blackmail Elliot is in that little folder of yours . That will be enough , Doctor . It is not enough , damn it . You 've had it in for Michael ever since the ICV incident . - Dr. Kane ... - You 've been waiting ... for an opportunity like this to get rid of Michael so that he couldn 't ... he 's been looking for an excuse ... a few months back , Michael Foster developed a retro-clonal virus ... a virus with the ability to seek out specific chromosomes within certain organ cells . This virus could have been used to hunt down and destroy malignantly mutated genes . Ultimately , it might one day have rid mankind of most inheritable diseases . Dr. Viallini had other plans . Son of a bitch ! You had no right to call the Defense Department in on this one . This is my project . It 's my work , my responsibility . You are an employee of the Talos Corporation . Any materials you develop , any research you undertake is funded by this corporation . Hence , it is owned solely by this corporation . It is the board of trustees who determine when , where and to whom we offer the results of our research . Not some pig-headed Ph.D. With delusions of ... - You incredible bastard ! - Michael . We are not discussing some secret recipe here . We are talking about a search-and-destroy virus that could be perverted and manipulated to wipe out selected populations of the human race ! - I will not be responsible ! - You 're not that naive , Doctor , nor that innocent . You 've taken a willing part in many projects whose objectives were less than altruistic . This is no different . I 'm not going to let you get away with this . I 'll destroy all the data , all the samples . Do not make irrational threats you 'll be sorry for . This is no threat . I 'll blow the whistle on you and your little mutant freak show downstairs . I 'm sure the National Genetic Council would have a field day in this place . Subpoenas will be flying around here like a ticker-tape parade . You are just as much responsible . You 'll be cutting your own throat . I may go down , Doctor , but I swear to Christ , I 'll drag you with me . You wouldn 't . You want to play hardball ? You just try me . Michael . Michael ! He 's a very stupid man . I suggest you speak with him , set him straight , before I 'm forced to take more drastic measures . You 're wasting valuable time , Doctor . Mr. Jarrett and Mr. Mitchell are not interested in your accusations or your fantasies . They work for me . If any harm comes to Michael Foster , I will see to it personally that the NGC strings you up by the balls . Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Jarrett are waiting . Please continue . Within hours , Michael 's entire body had been infected . ( groaning ) Elliot set up the lab facilities for treating Michael , but the mutations were too rapid , and research led only to dead ends . As the days passed , Michael changed even more , as if his entire cellular structure was being rearranged ... redefined by the alien tissue . Nancy , come here . I 'll need your help . Hold that open while I get a sample . ( screeches ) What the hell was that ? ( screeching ) Elliot ! Are you trying to give me a heart attack ? Stand back . Come here , you little son of a ... ( screeching ) What in God 's name is that ... thing ? I don 't know , but I 'm not taking its temperature . Look at this thing . Jesus Christ ! Freakin ' thing 's pissing on me . Elliot 's theory was not quite accurate . These small masses of flesh contained a caustic venom , ejected through a hollow quill in its mouth , I suppose . But like a bumblebee , once the stinger has spent its venom , the mass dies and virtually decomposes within minutes . It is not a pleasant sight . ( intercom buzzes ) Yes ? Who ? I see . Give me a moment and then send her in . Wait outside for a moment . It appears that Officer Griffen 's daughter is here asking questions . She hasn 't seen her father all day and she 's ... Ah , Miss Griffen . Come in . I 'd like you to meet Dr. Nancy Kane . - Doctor , this is Stephanie . - Sherry . Hello , how do you do ? Your father has talked about you quite often , Sherry . I understand you are a very smart young lady . You 're studying computers , is it ? Micro-circuit design and engineering . Very impressive . Very impressive , indeed . When you graduate I hope you come see me . I 'm sure we can find a spot here at Talos for somebody with your talents . Thank you , sir . I 'd like to ask you about my father . Ah , yes ? A fine man ! One of our most trusted and loyal employees . Dr. Viallini ... my father 's been gone since last night . I haven 't seen or heard from him since . I 'm very worried . It 's not like him . I see . Well , according to our log ... your father didn 't work here last night . Wait . You mean he wasn 't here ? No , it says here he called in sick . Yes . That 's confirmed . Another security guard is listed on his shift . This is very strange . It 's not like him to leave Kim and me without calling . I wouldn 't worry . I 'm sure there 's some explanation . I 'll keep my ears open . And if he doesn 't show up soon , I 'll personally see to it that my people find out where he is . Thank you so much for stopping by . Feel free to stop by anytime you have a problem we can help you with . We may have trouble with her . The question is , where could it be hiding ? Where would it be hiding ? I would appreciate it if you would stop saying " it . " That is still Michael Foster , no matter what he 's turned into . I 'm sorry , Doctor , I forgot how close you two were . Well , when I saw him last he looked pretty slimy . He 'd begun to resemble some sort of garden bug or slug , or leach . ( groaning ) ( groaning continues ) Dr. Stein ! Thank you , very much , Doctors . Now would either one of you care to retrieve my probe , or shall I just take a reimbursement out of petty cash ? Elliot ! This is no time for levity . ( screaming ) Ta-da ! For my next trick ... By this time , even his internal physiology had transformed . His blood became highly caustic , his heart enlarged by nearly twice its original size , and he was becoming less and less responsive to the medications . Finally , after four weeks of dead ends , Elliot made a major breakthrough . Computer : Nucleic IVM : One part per billion . Cellular engraination reaching MD T threshold . ( groaning ) Temperature : 58 ° Celsius . Michael . ( screaming ) Elliot ! Elliot ! Michael ! Computer : Microbiotic enzyme distention at 47 % . I think we 've got it . RNA factor : 0.936 IMP . Take a look . A few minutes ago that sample was completely infected by the alien cells . But this shows no sign of infection . - Thank you very much . - Elliot , you 're wonderful ! Yes , I know . How did you do it ? Elementary , my dear . I 'd been noticing strange molecular behavior whenever I exposed samples through the electron microscope . The reaction to negative pulse phasing caused rampant destabilization of the molecular bonding , but only at specific wavelengths . As it turns out , cellular and biological activity is halted for a period of time when electricity is introduced . I can 't be that simple . You 've received total remission . When his heart stopped , we gave him electro-shock resuscitation ... it did nothing . You 're talking about normal AC current . You got two problems there . One , there 's no way to control or focus it at specific enough wavelengths . Secondly , the amount of energy required to stop and reverse Michael 's metamorphosis would fry him . Well ? Well , what ? Well , how did you manage it ? - Wow ! - Elliot ! I , uh ... I borrowed this little machine from the boys down in particle acceleration . - An atom smasher ? - That 's right . But it 's not atom smashing I 'm interested in . You see , the particles are accelerated through a series of electromagnets . As they travel and build up speed around its curved course , electrons fly off , sort of like tires screeching when you take a turn very fast . But these electrons can be focused and manipulated to any wavelength . So , I can control the output . And this way we can reverse the process and still keep Michael alive . That 's what I 'm hoping for , yeah . Well what are we waiting for ? Come on , let 's give it a try . Nancy , hold on . Calm down . I still need to do a few more tests . Besides , this machine isn 't nearly powerful enough to do the job . We can use Agnes . My thinking exactly . A cyclotron the size of Agnes will put out 10 times the power we need . We 'll have to construct a terminal in a room nearby the accelerator tunnel . Let 's schedule the first test next week sometime . If we can keep Michael alive until then ... I 'll talk to Viallini right away . Tell me exactly what 's required , and I 'll have him take care of it . The particles are accelerated ... Within a week the terminal was constructed . We called it the atomic shotgun . Let me see that . Agnes , this cyclotron , it 's never been tested ? Construction has only just been completed . We expect a full-power test firing tonight in ... less than six hours , as a matter of fact . And the engineers , they have no knowledge of this shotgun 's purpose ? Only the four of us in this room . Go on , Doctor . Michael 's transformation continued while we conducted more tests preparing for tonight ... unfortunately .

So , you really have no idea what this thing looks like . My God , it doesn 't matter what he looks like . Believe me , there will be no doubt in your mind when you see him . Sherry , you 're acting ridiculous . You are really paranoid . He was lying to me . He told me my father never even showed up for work last night , that he called in sick . All right , all right , so maybe your father did call in sick . Maybe he had other plans , personal plans that Viallini wouldn 't let him off work for . He would have told me . He would never leave Kim and me this long without calling . Maybe he did call . You 've been gone all day . You 're leaving the room . I didn 't even think about the answering machine . I just got it a few days ago . Answering machine : Hi , handsome . I just wanted to make sure you 're still going to stop by . I 've got the martinis chilling . I 'll be waiting . Ciao . See , what did I tell you ? Your father probably got lucky ... Shh ! Hi , honey . I guess you 're still at the movies . I stopped off at Susan 's for a drink before work . I left my ID pass at home . I was going to ask you to bring it . Don 't worry about it . I 'll use Jerry 's pass tonight . I 'm running late . Gotta get to work . Make sure Kim gets to bed early . See you tomorrow . I love you . They 've got him . They 're holding him there . What are you talking about ? He 's been telling me about all the weird things going on at that place . Now they 've got him . Don 't you think you 're being a little ridiculous ? He said he wanted to quit , that they were making him nervous with all the dangerous experiments they 've been doing on animals and stuff . They 're probably experimenting on him . Sherry , Sherry , this is absurd . Calm down . Do you hear what you 're saying ? They don 't do experiments on people . - I 'm going out there . - Out where ? Sherry ! Sherry , will you slow down a minute ? You 're not thinking straight . Hey , dude . Where are you all off to ? Have you heard from Daddy yet ? They 've got him . I 'm sure of it . God knows what they 're doing to him . Sherry , stop it . You 're going to scare Kim . What 's going on , Sherry ? Where 's Dad ? We 're gonna go find him . He may be in trouble . We don 't know that , Sherry . Kim , I want you to stay here . He might call . Screw that ! I 'm going with you . You 're not going anywhere . Someone 's got to stay here in case he calls . Besides , you 'd never get in there . You wanna bet ? Don 't argue with me , Kim . Just stay here . - Screw you , Sherry . - Sherry ... - Here , put this on . - For what ? Do you think we 're going to get in because of these white coats ? No ... because of this . This is a security card . Level five clearance . This 'll open any door in the place . Sher ... Sherry !

What about the woman , Dr. Kane ? If she cannot be persuaded to cooperate , to remain silent , you shall have to arrange an accident . Do you understand ? Yes , sir . ( tires screech ) I can 't believe we 're doing this . Look , if you don 't want to go in , just tell me . I mean if our relationship means that little to you . All right , all right , all right , let 's go . Brian , this is my father . I know . Let 's do it . What a bitch ! Will you calm down ? You 're making me nervous . My God , he 's enormous !

Release magnetic lock to open accelerator doors . That 's it . Accelerator engaged . Particle flux : 10 to the 26th power . They 'll be test firing in exactly two minutes . Kim : Test firing ? The particle accelerator that runs in a two-mile arc just below us . Please enter coupler interface code now . There it is . Electron coupler . Activated by this access code . I got it . - Hydraulic systems set . - Okay , go . Throttle control engaged . Electron coupler deployed . Magnetic stasis grid locked and operational . Don 't touch those ! Who the ... - Negative flux phase shift C - 2.38 ° . - Wavelength . 97.42 megawatts ? I don 't know what this means . Well , figure it out . We 've got less than a minute . Hey , get off her back . She 's doing the best she can . In 30 seconds that won 't be good enough . I got it . I 've got it . Power output , magnetic coupling . This is it ! You better be damn sure , sweetheart . It 's gonna be my ass out there . What are you talking about ? Someone has to draw him beneath the dispersion plates . I don 't get paid enough for this shit . Are you crazy ? You can 't go out there ! You want the job ? No screwing around . When I get that thing under that grid , you hit it . I hope you 've got health insurance . There 's going to be enough radioactivity out there to microwave half of Newark . Don 't remind me . - Well , what should I do ? - Pray for me . You 're sure ? I 've got it . Error , error . System shutdown . - Please reset . - I 've got it ! System shutdown . Please reset . All right , open the door . Come on . Come on . - Shit ! - ( both scream ) Come on . Sit , you ugly mother ... Come to papa . Flux capacitors engaged . Now , hit it . Get out of there ! Don 't argue with me , goddamn it ! Just do it ! ( screaming ) Beam crash . Beam crash . For Christ sakes , what are you waiting for ? It 's not working , damn it ! Please allow 1 minute , 52 seconds to recharge . Kim , what are you doing ? - He saved my life ! - Kim , don 't ! Sherry : Kim ! Kim ! No ! Kid , no ! Oh , come on ! No ! No ! Over here ! No ! All right , you fucker , try and swallow this . 20 seconds to discharge capacity . No ! 10 seconds , nine ... eight , seven , six ... five , four , three ... two , one . Electron coupler at ... Turn it off ! Turn it off , it worked . Electron flow terminated . Radiation levels normal . Neutron dispersion at 46 % . What the hell were you waiting for ? You stupid bitch . And you , you miserable fuck . - What are you doing ? - Don 't shoot him . Sorry , girls . Gotta tie up some loose ends . Now get back in there . Now ! Sorry , pally . Doctor 's orders . Yeah , I 'm gonna enjoy this . That 's right , you son of a bitch , smile . What the ? ( screaming ) - ( roars ) - ( screams ) Accelerator at mid-cyle . Please allow 27 seconds ... Danger . Danger . - What are you doing ? - I don 't know . Overload status . Warning . Warning . Electron continuity terminated . Magnetic stress function nominal . Electron depletion at minus 26,000 RMS . Neutron absorption : 12 billion KTS per cubic centimeter . Radiation level acceptable . Is it over ? I certainly hope so . Let 's go home . Primary path systems online . - ( screams ) - Ahh ! Brian ! We thought you were dead . The creature ... how did you escape ? Just lucky , I guess . - Oh ! - Ah , sorry . Quarantine status lifted . All sectors secured . Have a nice day .

 The first word in my dreams I could clearly see Planet Eden high beyond the skies Beautiful and sad ls this story I 'll tell Of a winged travellers eager 'Twas one day The wind guided him where to go Like an eagle High above he flew Waving from down below He flew out of sight into the mystical darkness Neither a smile nor a cry I gave When he left Feeling my spleen decline And hoping one day we 'd fly Over Back to the places we once shared Where vessels glide ln silky waves and of gold Deep in the gulf such planet lies Surrounded by this universe of love and hate Confusion breaks through and dwells [ Gunshots ] - [ Pilots Yelling ] 107 , that was my target ! - Get out of the way ! Take the one at the rear ! - Come on , come on , come on ! - There 's no more space to maneuver here ! - Yes ! What ? - We 're caught ! You little son of a- - [ Screams ] Hey , you little shit ! What are you trying to prove ? You trying to kill me ? - [ indistinct Yelling ] - Ha , going for the small-fry , huh ? That 's how they get you . - Shit ! The pod is jammed ! Somebody help ! Mayday ! Mayday ! - Shit ! - [ indistinct Yelling ] - 103 , don 't move ! It 's over ! [ Screaming ] I 'm hit ! - [ indistinct Yelling ] - These little guys are so dull . [ Yelling ] Okay , so it 's not dull . - l hate it when they let you down . - Where the hell 's our backup ? - [ Beeping ] - Ha ! There 's got to be someone better than these slackers ! [ Pilot ] Transferred ? - [ Commander ] That 's right . You understand why , of course . - Certainly not ! Seven times disobeying direct orders . Five times home confinement . Six times having your pilot 's license revoked . - You should be grateful we aren 't just going to court-martial you . - Okay . Where to ? The traveling repair of the satellite Echo might be appropriate . Or fragment disposal on the planet Barnard . Just your style . - Or the coal mine on the planet Banipal . - [ Groans ] But they won 't accept an outlaw ... as crazy as you seem to be , Mr. Isamu Dyson . So you are being transferred out here . - [ Beeping ] - To Eden , huh ? New Edwards Test Flight Center . Well- - Huh ? Listen , a test pilot won 't encounter too many enemies . - [ Tapping ] - But you are already your own worst enemy . Hey , thanks ! Then I 'm really gonna be a test pilot ? Dyson , show the proper decorum ! Yeah ! Lieutenant Dyson ready for transfer ! All right ! [ Jets Passing ] - [ Bird Squawking ] - [ P.A. ] L.C.R. cooling system minus 196 degrees . The crystal chip element will be activated now . - Oil pressure systems plus 1.25 . - The second and third optical and electronic systems are checked . Action to brain wave control system is good . High-pressure propellant injection 65 % completed . Open valve to the subsidiary tanks . Begin injecting to Tank A and Tank B. The alpha and the beta waves are flat . The theta wave needs adjustment to 1.3 to be connected to the sensor . Biofeedback readouts are good . The man-machine wave has made contact . Synchronization is complete . Chief Guld , go ahead and connect to the inner brain direct-image system . Roger . [ Heart Beating ] B.D.l. systems reading satisfactory . - Ground level : 1018 millibar . - YF-21 , Omega-1 , stand by for launch . [ Engines Revving ] Hmm , too quiet . [ Gasps ] - What the fu- - - [ Beeping ] New Edwards ? Eagle 107 . Let me know if you 're receiving transmission . Over . [ Static ] We copy , Eagle . Proceed . Over . An unidentified flying object has just passed area seven at an altitude of 38,000 . No image on radar . Request confirmation . Over . Area seven ? You don 't need to be concerned , Eagle . Can 't explain details . Over and out . Was that the , the brand-new fighter everyone 's talking about ? [ Laughing ] Excellent ! Yee-haw ! [ Laughing ] [ Beeping ] Hello , Edwards . I 'm First Lieutenant lsamu Dyson . [ Dyson ] Let me introduce myself . First Lieutenant lsamu Dyson , whom you 've all been waiting for . I 've just arrived to assume my post . - [ Tapping ] - [ Laughs ] So when do I fly , sir ? Maybe you should take a little break . You 've obviously become lightheaded . I 'm Millard , Chief Planner . - l hear you 're very short-tempered . - Yes , sir . Sounds like you don 't want to be promoted . Right. lf l rise too high in rank , I can 't be a pilot . I understand , but you 're going to have to demonstrate ... a little more ambition for this project . - [ Millard ] Sit down . - Sir ! This project , called Super Nova , is to test and develop ... candidates for the next main transforming fighter ... to replace the VF-Thunderbolt currently being used . In order to solve colonial planet disputes ... and in case of an emergency due to an alien attack , this new transforming fighter will make it possible to perform the hyperspace fold on its own . Not using a reactive weapon , which might cause a political problem , the new fighter will break through the enemy line and destroy ... only their military headquarters or rescue hostages . We will compare the YF-19 , manufactured by a new company called industry , and the YF-21 , made by General Galaxy . The superior one will win the funding . [ Dyson ] So , when do I fly ? - [ Millard ] ls the schedule for the YF-19 ready ? - [ Lucy ] Yes . The report says it will be returned from the factory within a week , sir . - Uh , what happened to it ? - Hmm ? It needed a few repairs after the test flight . Oh , you guys had bad luck with your last test pilot , huh ? But now I 'm here , and everything will be okay . No problem ! All of our pilots have said the same thing until they 've actually been out there . Four of them used up their health insurance , and two of them received a considerable promotion . The commendations they were buried with are guaranteed to last a lifetime . Just who the hell are you ? Why don 't you let the adults take care of this one , huh ? Put your pimple stuff on and go to bed . Got it ? A pilot , or so I 'm led to understand , can grasp a situation immediately , right ? And so I put this to you . Why do you think I 'm here ? Uh ... hmm ... - well , maybe you 're Millard 's son ? - [ Giggling ] Hmph . He is the design chief of the YF-19 , Yang Neumann . - That kid ? - Age , sex and race are truly meaningless concepts ... on this base , Lieutenant Dyson . - Well , excuse me then . - [ Guld ] May I come in ? - What ? - Huh ? Let me introduce the test pilot for General Galaxy . Chief Guld Goa Bowman . So he 's the test pilot . Their fighter , the YF-21 , which is operated by brain waves is epoch-making . Chief Bowman , this is First Lieutenant lsamu Dyson , assigned to the YF-19 team . Captain , regarding today 's flight , the adjustment of the thought-control system worked very well . We can start fire-control testing within three days . So , you must be the one I saw in area seven . Your report sounds very encouraging . I suppose you can 't stay idle . - l 'm afraid he 'll be a useless waste . - What ? Say that again ! A high-priced fighter will only be wasted on him ; - a pilot with absolutely no controlling ability . - [ Glass Shattering ] - Who you talkin ' about ? - l think you just answered your own question . Huh ? - [ Groans ] - You haven 't unpacked your stuff , have ya ? The sooner that you run away , the better for you . - l wonder if they 've ever met before ? - They do act like friends . Give me a break ! [ Beeping , Clicking ] [ Typing ] [ Typing Continues ] [ Gasps ] [ Gasping Continues ] [ Groaning , Gasping ] [ Shuddering ] [ Shakes Pills , Swallows ] [ Sighs ] Anti-laser system and pinpoint-barrier system ... and the brand-new active air force control . Huh ! Hmm . [ Grunting , Laughing ] - [ Yelling Continues ] - [ Group ] Huh ? [ Grunting , Groans ] [ Gasps ] [ Laughing ] Whew , looks like we 're both dead , huh ? Aren 't you ever serious about anything ? Try it again ! Hey , even I can 't resurrect the dead ! Let 's call it a day . Everybody , go home . But- - Hey , wait . If you don 't change your attitude , we 'll never catch up with General Galaxy ! Do you understand ? [ Groans , Feedback ] Now , I don 't want to eat you up , little man . Get off my back . You there , in the ribbon , you want to come with me and mourn the late , great lsamu ? Huh ? [ Engine Revving ] - Ya-hoo ! - [ Screams ] Slow down ! I want to mourn lsamu , not join him ! - [ Laughing ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Yelling ] - Slow down ! [ Screaming ] You 're insane ! Stop it , or you 're gonna kill us both , you crazy bastard ! Did you say faster ? [ Laughing ] [ Laughing Continues ] - [ Lucy ] You 're out of your mind ! - [ Dyson ] Yeah , so what ? I heard there used to be a forest around here , and those who climbed the mountain- - - Saw a giant pterosaur . - How did you know ? You 're riding with the original roughneck of Dalmatian High School . - No kidding ? You should have told me that before ! - Huh ? - [ indistinct Singing ] - That voice . No , it couldn 't . That 's Sharon Apple . She 's coming here soon. I can 't wait ! - She sounds like an old friend of mine . - [ Laughing ] - You only wish it was . - What ? - Because Sharon 's not a human . - She 's not a human ? - Oh . Cool ! - [ Screaming ] [ Rock ] [ Horns Honking ] [ Crowd Mumbling ] Come on , this way ! [ Crowd Talking ] Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much for coming this afternoon . I am presently the general director in charge ... of the Sharon Apple Galaxy Tour , Ms. Myung Fang Lone . I can answer your questions . The people of Eden have been eagerly anticipating this concert by Sharon . Do you think we 'll get a chance to see her today , Ms. Lone ? I 'm very sorry to say that she 'll be resting today . - She needs her beauty sleep . - [ Reporters Laughing ] [ Reporter ] lt 's been said that Sharon is no longer ... just a virturoid idol created by computer ... and is now ranked as the number one celebrity everyone wants as a girlfriend . - Mr. Reymond , her owner , said he 'd like to adopt her . - [ Crowd Laughing ] [ Reporter # 2 ] Some specialists say the voice generated by the computer ... is nothing more than a deception because the computer does not possess emotions . That is not true , and I believe she will be quite deeply hurt if she hears that . Her heart is much more delicate than any ordinary human 's . - [ Reporter # 2 ] So there 's no truth to the rumor- - - Oh . Hey , did you hear ? The 19 team got screwed big time because of the bizarre pilot and his antics . - [ TV Continues ] - l hear the odds are running three to one in our favor . - l feel like we 've already won . - We 'd better not underestimate him . Hey , hey , the military and all the safe money are betting on our team ! - No way we can lose ! [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ] - Thank you , everyone , and we 'll be seeing you ... - Huh ? at the Atlantis Dome in three days . [ Man ] And that concludes today 's press conference . - [ Flashbulbs Popping ] - Myung . [ Crowd Chattering ] - [ Sirens Wailing ] - [ Crowd Chanting ] Sharon ! We want Sharon ! [ Chanting Continues , Camera Shutters Clicking ] [ Crowd Chanting ] We want Sharon ! [ Chanting Continues ] - [ Roadies ] That 's wrong ! Over here . Hey ! - Where you taking that ? [ Manager ] lt 's ludicrous ! Get me some professionals ! - [ Roadies ] Can somebody send me up a 9 / 16ths , please ? - Yeah . - [ Myung ] Will we be up by rehearsal ? - Look , my hands are tied . - What do you think we 're paying you for ? - l 'm counting on you . - [ indistinct Yelling ] - The coordinates of the 3-D sound image are off by three points . - Can you shift the B.L. unit 1.2 degrees to the right ? - The B.L. ! Move it right ! [ Myung ] Secretion of dopamine from block 35-B in the right lobe is insufficient . Should I increase the stimulation on emotion ... or change the cable to UCL-type ? Change the sampling data to PSX-type and stimulate that . [ Computer Gibberish ] - All right , baby ! - Increase the stimulation just a little on A-10 . Let 's add about three percent of beta-endorphine code . Ms. Lone , excuse me . Your taxi 's waiting . You 're scheduled to make final adjustments on Sharon tomorrow afternoon . And I fired two roadies and replaced them with a couple of locals . - Everything else is ready . Have a good rest . - l see . Thank you . [ Computer Gibberish Continues ] Man , I 've never seen that place so packed ! Say , isn 't that where Sharon 's concert 's going to be ? Everybody 's crazy about her . You know , I actually wanted to go to the concert ? I even stood in line . Can you imagine ? But the tickets sold out , even at that price ! - Everything has changed , hasn 't it ? Everything . - Yeah , for better or worse . The development 's been bustling , that 's for sure . The only things that haven 't changed much are the forests and some of the mountains . - And the Star Hill ? - Nah , Star Hill hasn 't changed a bit since I came here . And that was a long time ago . Hmm , how could it be exciting listening to a computer singing ? - She 's not just an ordinary computer . - [ Crunching ] Sharon 's songs make me feel , I don 't know , good . [ Sea Gulls Squawking ] You really are out of it . I guess you don 't hear much of anything in deep space . Even if I could , I 'm not really interested in that . What I am interested in is finding a place where we can go back to nature . [ Grunts ] - Well , you know , a place for a natural embrace . - [ Gasps ] - Your nature is pretty transparent . - [ Chuckling ] - Okay , then why don 't we go to the Star Hill ? - Huh ? That 's not a very good place to go . It 's the best place to go if you want to find out about nature . [ Giggles ] [ Wind Howling , Birds Squawking ] [ Squawking ] - [ Sighs , Gasps ] - [ Rustling ] Oh . [ Squawking ] [ Sighs ] Huh ? [ Squawking Continues ] Guld Bowman ? How ? How did you know I was here ? I saw you on the news. I thought you wouldn 't leave Eden without coming here . And I was right . This place hasn 't changed very much . There 's nothing here . And nothing makes it boring . - [ Guld ] How long have you been on Eden ? - l got here yesterday . It 's been seven years . Do you know anything about Sharon Apple ? [ Laughs ] I suppose you have no interest in something like a virturoid idol . Now I 'm the producer of the number one singer in the galaxy . - So , I have risen in the world . - Are you still singing ? I quit all that , a long time ago it seems . So , what are you doing these days ? Actually , I 'm a test pilot at the New Edwards base in the desert . Moved up in the world as well , huh ? I have an idea . Why don 't you come to the concert ? You might find it interesting . I 'll abuse the producer 's privilege . As a matter of fact , I 've just prepared for the concert . It should be the best ever . Sharon is the best . [ Gasps ] That 's enough . Forget about what happened back then , Myung . [ Wind Howling ] I will help you forget . [ Vehicle Approaches , Stops ] - [ Dyson ] See ? I told you . It 's too crowded . - [ Gasps ] - Huh ? - lt 's Chief Bowman ! [ Gasps ] Well , it 's been a long time , Isamu . - Uh ... - Who is she ? Well , how about introducing me ? Uh , yeah . Honey , that 's the idol of our school festival , Miss Myung . I had no idea you belonged to Guld now . [ Gasps ] - [ Guld Approaching ] - Be careful . - [ Grunts ] - [ Chuckles ] - [ Grunts ] Hmm , so , I 'm someone who lacks any self-control , huh ? - [ Growls , Grunts ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Vehicle Falls ] - [ Growls ] You shit ! Come on and show me what you 've got ! [ Growling ] - No ! Don 't ! - [ Gasps ] [ Gasps , Sighs ] How could you come back to Eden ? I won 't let you keep destroying things ; Myung or the project . Let it go . Please stop it ! It 's all right if you 've forgotten about me , Isamu . I 'm not the same person that you left behind so long ago on this little planet . Everything is different for me now ! - l won 't let you have her . - That 's a noble sentiment , but you know it 's the project that I want . Neither one deserves a bastard like you ! Tower to Omega-1 , area is clear , atmospheric conditions good . Over . - Roger . - [ Lucy ] Tower to each chaser , activate tracking camera . Send image to Omega-1 . Over . - Chaser 2 , roger . - Chaser 3 , roger . [ Dyson Laughing ] Chaser 1 , roger ! - [ Groans ] - Chaser 1 , you know your duty is to track for the record . Isamu , what are you doing ? Do you want to get yourself disqualified for real ? You sound so sexy when you 're angry . - You ! - [ Dyson ] Well , the tracking camera 's standing by . - l 'll send the image now . Over . - Roger . [ Clanking ] [ Guld ] Omega-1 to tower . I 've entered the operation area . I can start any time . Tower to Omega-1 . This is Millard . I 'm ordering bomber nine to execute the sham attack using 20 of the remote control drones . In this exercise , we will examine the ability ... of the YF-21 to avoid enemy missiles and its air battle performance . - We expect a result of more than 70 percent . Very good . - l guarantee 100 percent . 60 seconds to the targets . [ Chuckles ] I 'll show you just how superior I am . Stealth . [ Beeping ] lmpressive . Let 's party ! [ Grunting ] [ Rumbling ] This is too much for the booster rocket to take ! [ Tower ] All drones now launching high-maneuver missiles . The new style high-maneuver missiles . What would be the predicted attack spread ? Hmm . - [ Klaxon Sounding ] - lt 's accelerating ? What ? He 's crazy ! All missiles avoided ! The relative speed is too fast for the close-range fuse to be activated . [ Chuckling ] Interesting . All missiles avoided ? Where the hell is he ? [ Grunts ] Chaser 1 , there 's no need to worry . Those are the unarmed missiles the YF-21 avoided . It 's okay . You can let them hit you . That 's a pleasant thought , Lucy , but I 'm not gonna. lf Guld can do it , so can I ! [ Grunting ] [ Groans ] [ Dyson Screaming ] - Omega-1 , we will arrange 20 drones at 500 behind you . - [ Gasps ] - [ Millard ] You can avoid them , can 't you ? - l 'll show you . - Witness the true ability of the YF-21 . - [ Tower ] T-minus ... three , two , one , fire ! [ Gunfire ] Shit ! I should have lost the other booster too ! Huh ? Only one left . Damn it ! Huh ? Dyson , what are you trying to do ? [ Screams ] [ Groaning ] Dyson ! - [ Groaning ] - Omega-1 , problem ! Omega-1 ! Beta noise increased . Abnormal signal is amplifying . Execute an emergency formation . - Omega-1 , bail out now ! - Emergency formation ! - No ! It 'll go away ! It has to ! - Emergency formation , all pilots . - Repeat : Emergency formation ! - l 'll recover ! [ Groans ] - [ Millard ] Omega-1 , bail out immediately ! - l will recover ! Wow , this is really an impressive new fighter , even the way that it burns up . - [ Gasps ] - [ Groaning ] - [ Tower ] Chaser 2 and Chaser 3 are on their way . - Altitude : 800 , 750 , 700 , 650 , 600 , 550 , 500 . Sir , it keeps going down ! 400 ! Extreme danger now ! 350 , 300 , 250 , 200- - Chaser 1 , rescue him now or your pilot license will be revoked ! Revoked immediately ! Chaser 1 , are you reading me ? - Chaser 1 ? - Well , I guess I can 't disobey a direct order . - [ Klaxon Sounding ] - [ Gasping ] Get lost ! [ Sighs ] [ Beeping ] What a meddler . Hmm . If the YF-21 creates a downward force right now- - Yes ! - [ Thud ] - What ? - [ Yells ] - [ Groans ] [ Dyson Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Groaning ] [ Groans ] Stupid son of a bitch ! What the hell were you doing ? - Hmm , you have the devil 's luck . I don 't know how you survived . - [ Growling ] Huh ? You did that ... on purpose then ? [ Chuckles ] I 'm sorry . It was an accident . [ Singing ] [ Man Over P.A. ] Ten more minutes until we open the gate . Please be patient . This line is for pre-paid customers only . [ People Chattering ] One , two , three , four , whoo ! Let 's see now , 4210 . [ Fans Chattering ] [ Rumbling ] [ Fans Chanting ] Sharon ! Sharon ! [ Millard ] Go ahead and give your report . There seems to be a problem in BDS . I think the Command Recognition unit ... has a potential need for improvement ; that 's my personal assessment anyway . You 're saying the abnormal wave form in the brain wave data had nothing to do with yourself ? I remained calm throughout the exercise , Chief Johnson . Indeed , you are the only one who knows the whole truth in this matter ... since half the YF-21 's controlling system is your brain . Whether this happened accidentally or intentionally , the results are somewhat less than beneficial to the project 's morale . - Yes , sir . - Even Dyson has some value . Uh- - [ Sighs ] - [ Door Opens ] - You 're dismissed . [ Phone Ringing ] It 's Millard . Let me speak with Dr. Worth . [ Panting ] [ Millard ] I 'd like you to commence a confidential inquiry into Guld Goa Bowman . [ Crowd Cheering Wildly ] [ Cheering Continues ] [ Sharon Apple Singing ] [ Singing Continues ] [ Continues ] [ Singing Stops ] [ Industrial ] [ Continues ] [ Man ] Excitement rate is at 72 % . 4.5 % higher than planned . [ Sharon Apple Singing ] [ Continues ] [ Man # 1 ] Excitement rate at 87 % . Ninety percent . [ Continues ] - What the hell you doin ' ? - Hmph ! [ Device Beeping ] lt 's none of your business , since you 're not a fan of Sharon . [ Chuckles ] Just watch and learn . [ Whispers ] Over here . - [ Gasps ] Hey , what 's going on ? - l don 't believe it ! is it a bug , or a virus ? [ Singing Continues ] [ Beeps ] Stop it ! You 'll get arrested . Well , I can 't stop . Sharon is the most advanced type ... of artificial intelligence system ever developed by the Macross Consortium . If I can 't hack into it , I 'll lose my reputation as the ultimate hacker . Oh , somebody save me from him . [ Myung ] lsamu ? What 's happening to you ? Your heart rate 's become unstable . [ Panting ] [ Sharon Apple Singing ] Huh ? Oh , baby , look at me - Oh , whoa ! That 's way out there . - Come to me , Sharon . Huh ? [ Gasps ] Since we couldn 't find anything wrong with the black box , we must assume it 's you . You had better work a little harder on your mental training , Miss Myung . [ Myung ] I understand . You trust machines more than living beings , then ? That 's not what I meant . If this kind of incident keeps occurring , people might find out Sharon 's program isn 't complete . And of course , you are here to insure that does not happen . - You must be cautious . - l understand . - Let 's call it a night. I 'm exhausted . - Good night , then . [ Grunts , Sighs ] [ Acoustic Guitar ] [ Yang ] You 're sure you can fly ? This is quite different from smashing up my simulator ! Arrr ! Yang , forget it . In his mind , he 's already flying . [ Moans ] And we just got the " " 19 " " fixed . Oh , I 've been waiting for you , my pretty girl . [ Jet Engine Roaring ] Yeah ! Only 48 seconds to reach atmospheric service ceiling . You 're not just another pretty face , are ya ? Wee-ha-ha ! - [ Men Laughing ] - Alpha One , do you read me ? Alpha One , what the hell are you doing ? Follow the procedure as scheduled . I love it ! [ Whooping ] Hmph ! What a major jackass ! [ lsamu ] Come on , baby ! [ Engines Roaring ] [ Gasping ] - [ lsamu ] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ! - Oh , God ! I can 't watch him wreck my ship . [ Gasps ] Bring up the image from the third chasing camera . - [ Chattering lndistinctly ] - [ Gasping , Fainting ] [ Laughing ] Stop screwing ' around . [ Rumbling ] [ Beeping ] [ Chattering ] [ lsamu ] What do you mean I was going too far , sir ? [ Clears Throat ] You can 't carry challenge and recklessness within the same pocket . - Do you know who said that , Lieutenant ? - Hmm , no , sir . I did . That 's the lesson I learned . And ? - Do you know what else you 're carrying in your pocket , Isamu Dyson ? - No . - Stupidity ! - [ Grumbles ] [ Grunts ] [ Chuckles ] Sure is easy to manipulate . [ Jet Passing Overhead ] - [ Liquid Bubbling ] - [ Machine Beeps ] [ Beeps ] [ Rumbling ] This is the final poker chip that will complete the module of the R.F. Entelechy , isn 't it ? Unfortunately , I don 't acknowledge Aristotle 's ideas . Or his suggestion that the mind has links to the flesh . I have my own philosophy . [ Kate ] lt really surprised me , Myung , when I saw you on TV ... introduced as Sharon Apple 's manager or something . [ Myung ] I 'm not really her manager . I 'm her producer . I see . Well , it all sounds the same to me . [ Chuckles ] You haven 't changed much , have you , Kate ? [ Giggles ] Well , I 'm the mother of two kids now . You got married ? [ Exhales ] Guess who my husband is ? - Uh- - - Isamu or Guld or Morgan ? Which one do you think ? - Morgan . - Oh , Myung . You 're no fun at all . I met up with the other two . It was quite by accident . Neither of them has changed very much . They told me that they were test pilots at the new Edwards Base . Oh ? That 's good . So their dreams came true for them as well . - Hey , long time no see . - Morgan ! Why didn 't you leave them with my mom ? Hey , I did go to her house . Believe me . She was holding a garage sale and I was afraid she 'd sell the kids off too if I left ' em . Aw , poor Daddy . - Dad ! - [ Laughs ] Now , now . They copy whatever I do . - [ Children ] Daddy . - [ Morgan ] Watch the glasses . [ Child Myung Crying ] [ Child lsamu ] Myung , we will protect you forever and ever ! [ Myung Continues Crying ] [ Child Guld ] That 's right . Forever . [ lsamu ] We will come to protect you from anywhere in the world . [ Crying Continues ] [ Kate ] Zoom , zoom My boyfriend is a pilot now - He 's a pilot now - Yeah ! Rock it ! Woo-woo ! [ Kate ] Come on , Myung . It 's your turn now . Yeah , I can hardly wait . The idol of the school festival . - Come on , honey , think of one . - Come on . Why don 't you sing that song you did back then ? - The one called " " Voices " " or something . - [ Morgan ] My favorite . Cut it out ! I mean , I quit singing a long time ago . I have nothing more to sing . I just got tired of it all . Besides , I can 't remember those old songs . You see ? - Uh ... I guess I 'll sing . - Where are you going ? - Kate ? - Hmm ? To the head . You 're gonna let me in anyway , so why don 't you just open the damn- - Aaah ! [ Tapping Computer Keyboard ] - What in the bloody- - - Hell I think I 'm doing , right ? Like to know ? I 'm kidnapping Sharon , of course . But I can 't find the most important parts . [ Rummaging Through Tools ] Well , I suppose her virginity would be kind of hard to get . Don 't get me confused with the way you are , Isamu . I was talking about getting her emotional programming . - Yeah , right , fan boy. I suppose that thing might possess some intelligence , - [ Gasping ] but no heart . Huh ? - Huh ? Wha- - - [ lntercom Ringing ] - [ Lucy Over Speaker ] lsamu , are you there ? - Not if it 's that asshole Millard ! - There 's some woman on the phone . - Well , that 's different . Hello there . Uh , Kate ! Hey , how 'd you know I was here ? Let me guess . You 've had your hot little heart set on me since high school . I 'm right . That 's it , huh ? [ Kate ] You 're the same fool I used to know . You 're probably still banging holes in the wall . - And you can still turn a phrase . - Guess what ? Myung is over and we 're having a few drinks . But she 's acting strange . She won 't sing . It 's weird . Imagine someone who loved to sing as much she did saying she actually quit . She even used to sing while she slept . You know , Isamu , being a producer for Sharon Apple , it doesn 't sound like her . - [ lsamu ] Just the producer ? - She says . You think it has something to do with ... the time when all three of you were so close together and then just separated like that ? How in the hell would I know ? It 's just- - l guess it means we just aren 't kids anymore . Come on . Can 't you come by even for a moment to cheer her up ? - Gimme a break , Kate . - Guld says he 's coming by . Oh ! Then I guess I 'm not needed . Besides , I have things to do . - Then I guess you don 't care if Guld gets her . - [ Grunts , lnhales ] I swear to you I 'm not coming ! [ Hangs Up Phone ] Damn ! How faithless . [ Gasps ] Wait ! Myung ! Myung , I 'm sorry . I don 't want to be a slave to the past anymore . I wanna be free . The Great Fall Lodge , please . Hurry . [ Car Drives Away ] - [ Horn Honking ] - [ Guld ] Kate . - Huh ? Where 's Myung ? - Uh , she just drove off . - Huh ? [ Grunts ] Do you know how much I hate your songs ? Hate my songs too . Oh , I wish I could end all of this . [ Sighs ] End it all and just vanish . [ Continues Tapping Keyboard ] [ Ringing ] Oh. lsamu here . Be someone interesting . - [ Beeping ] - Huh ? [ Computerized Voice ] ln 30 minutes , a fire will break out at the concert hall . What the hell ? In 30 minutes , a fire will break out at the concert hall . Hmm . A fire at the concert hall ? Myung . Ha ! I got it now . It must be Kate screwing ' with my head . Hmm . Maybe not . I 'm sorry. I 'm afraid Miss Myung Fang Lone hasn 't returned to the hotel yet . I see . Thanks . - Room 405 . And can you put this in the safe , please ? - Yes . [ Computerized Voice ] ln 30 minutes , a fire will break out at the concert hall . A fire in the concert hall ? Huh ? [ Beeping ] [ Buzzing ] [ Crackling ] [ Fire Crackling ] [ Gasps ] [ Screaming ] [ Coughing ] Help ! Somebody help me ! Anybody ! - [ Sirens Wailing ] - Shit ! - You shouldn 't mess with an expert in reckless driving . - [ Engine Revving Higher ] [ Coughing ] Myung ! Are you in there ? Myung ! Son of a bitch ! Why doesn 't the damned alarm go off ? [ Grunting ] [ Panting , Grunts ] [ Bangs Door ] [ Coughing ] [ Panting ] [ Door Sliding Open ] [ Grunting ] [ Yelling ] [ Straining ] [ Alarm Ringing ] [ Sighs ] [ Alarm Continues Ringing ] [ Sirens Wailing ] - Hey , hey , stop ! You can 't go in there . - l 'm involved . That 's right . No one was hurt at all . - No one was here at the time . - No one ? Yeah , but the damage to the facilities is pretty extensive . Really ? [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] [ Groaning , Coughing ] It 's you . - Do you hurt anywhere , Myung ? - [ Sighs ] No . That 's good . [ Gasps ] Guld , what happened to your arm ? - Nothing important . - Nonsense . Take off your shirt . - How did you know about the fire ? - l received a strange phone call . - A phone call ? - l was outside the Great Fall Lodge in my car . It said a fire would break out at the concert hall. lt was very unusual . So , you think someone set this up ? It doesn 't make sense . Why would they let me know exactly what was happening ? I 'm so sorry . You wouldn 't have been injured otherwise . - l 'm glad I could save you . Do you remember my vow , Myung ? - [ Gasps ] Ah- - Uh- - Thank you , Myung . You should get some rest . Well , I better get going . [ Crying ] [ Crying ] I didn 't want to see you . I didn 't want to go back to the past and all the bad memories . [ Sobbing ] I just hate it ! Hmph ! It 's none of my damn business anyway , right ? [ Dr. Worth ] After researching the brain scan records of Guld Goa Bowman , I found a doubtful secretion of beta endorphin . I assume that Guld , who inherited Zentradi blood , has been somehow suppressing ... his fighting instinct forcibly in some way . When that instinct is released , it- - Huh ? Keep this between us , Doctor . Proceed with your analysis , quietly . Yes , sir . [ Clears Throat ] So , where did you go last night , hmm ? I didn 't go anywhere . - Oh , your motorcycle drives itself . - [ Groans ] - What are you talking about ? - You went to see that woman who called you . - l didn 't see her . - So , then who ? Well , uh- - Hmph ! - [ Growls ] - Answer me ! - Not now . - Isamu ! Damn ! [ Exhales ] I see your well-trained brain doesn 't help you avoid injury , huh ? It 's only a small burn. I promised I would protect her , do you remember ? Protect who ? It can 't be . That fire- - l won 't let you lay your filthy hands on her . Ha ! Does that give you permission to touch her with all ten of your fingers ? Twenty if you count the ones on your feet. I won 't include the 21st . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Growls ] Huh ? Actually , we only need to fight over the project now . [ Chuckles ] I can 't wait , Guld . [ Jet Engine Roaring ] Shit ! What are you trying to do ? [ Laughs ] I got it for you because you 're too damned slow , Bowman . Slacker ! [ Operator ] Both Alpha One and Omega One have deviated from the test course . Their altitude is 2,000 , 2,300 , 2,600 . [ Guld ] Omega One to control . The situation has changed . I 'll now start collecting the battle-transformed fighting ability data . [ Operator # 1 ] Omega One , you are ordered to continue as planned . [ Operator # 2 ] Alpha One , please correct your course heading . Over . [ lsamu ] Control , there 's too much noise. I 'm going to temporarily ... disconnect the transmitter until the reception gets better . Over and out . - Oh , my God ! I think they 're gonna fight . - They 're nuts ! [ Operator # 1 ] Alpha One and Omega One now entering the city exercise field . I 've been waiting for this . Rock ' n ' roll ! [ Explosion ] [ Yells ] - [ Man # 1 ] Well , all right . - [ Man # 2 ] Come on , come on . Yeah ! - [ All Shouting ] - Come on , give it to him ! Oh , man ! That was a building ! - Yeah ! Yeah ! - lt 's pro wrestling . [ Groaning ] - [ Groaning Continues ] - Ammunition 's gone . [ Grunting ] [ Grunting Continues ] - [ All Cheering ] - Show me what you got , worthless piece of junk . [ Grunting ] Let your trained mind save you , bastard ! [ Beeping ] [ Groaning ] I wonder if they 're still all right out there ? I see no point in using fake ammunition if they 're going to scratch each other up like that . [ Millard ] What 's going on ? [ Explosion ] [ Phone Ringing ] Huh ? [ Ringing Continues ]

 Hey , I thought we were gonna play ball ! [ Rumbling ] [ Dogs Barking ] Come on ! Come on ! [ Dog Barking ] Stay , Bo-Jay . Hey , Mr. Higgins . You boys see somethin come down around here about ten minutes ago ? - Yeah , it 's back in the woods , in the clearing . - It 's really incredible . Come on , you have to come see it . It 's just through here . [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ] - Sam , great to see you . How you been ? - Jarvis , good to see you . - This is Doctor Sefton . - Mary . Hi . Sam . Hi . - What the hell 's he doing here ? - [ Jarvis ] This is important , Sam . Sorry about the short notice . - No problem . - They have their I.D.s ? So I 'm a Cavanaugh now . We 're tourists . If anyone asks , I 'm Charles Cavanaugh . Dr. Sefton is your sister . - My sister ? - Of whom you are extremely fond , in a clean-cut , healthy , all-American sort of way . So where 's my sister been all my life ? Dr. Sefton is on loan to us from NASA . Jarvis , get the trunk for me , will ya ? - Since when did the Office start drafting civilians ? - All you need to know for now ... is that , in the scheme of things , she is much more valuable to us than you are . - And I take it you 're as valuable as ever . - Naturally . So , if the two of you are being shot at , which bullet do I take ? You must try for both , of course . [ Engine Starts ] So tell me , Charles , what 's so important to drag you out of your office ... and into the field ? Something unusual was reported entering our atmosphere last night . One of our Keyhole satellites picked this up . You wanna give me a hint ? See the little blur in the upper left hand corner ? - Yeah . - The analysts speculate ... that that 's where the U.F.O. may have landed . That 's all we have ? We immediately sent in two agents . ' Dietman and Truly . They have failed to report back , and we have not been able to contact them . Peripheral reports ? Well , the usual ground sightings . Reports of a landing . And then a local TV station sent in a mobile unit to do a spot-cast . And they reported that , indeed , a U.F.O. had landed . An hour later they changed their tune . Claimed that it was a hoax , a fraud perpetrated by a couple of farm boys ... who had built this ... spaceship . Nice sign . [ Children Talking Excitedly ] - [ Boy ] Olly olly oxen free ! - [ Girl ] That 's not fair ! [ Children Talking , Yelling ] - You go ahead , I 'll catch up . - Okay . So tell me , Mary , what exactly do you do for NASA ? My specialty 's exobiology . - Exobiology ? - Mm-hmm . It 's a study of what alien life forms might be like . - You actually make a living at that ? - Mmm . Seems like it 'd be mostly guesswork . We had a joke in school that ours was the only science that didn 't have a subject matter . - Huh . - So you people are with the Office of Scientific Intelligence ? - Is that right ? - Yeah . - ' Til two days ago , I hadn 't even heard of it . - No , you wouldn 't have . Our existence isn 't public knowledge . Eisenhower started O-SCI back in ' 59 . Technically , we 're an offshoot of the C.I.A. , but the old man runs it like his own private dictatorship . - Pay for this , will you , Sam ? - Sure , Charles . Three for the , uh , flying saucer . What do you hear , Sam ? - No birds . - Hmm . Right . No birds . - Why spend all your money- - - He 's old enough to make his own decisions . [ Man ] Yeah , hold this . Straight enough ? [ People Talking ] - [ Boy ] Be right with ya ! - [ Woman ] Okay ! [ Man ] We 've traveled a long way . - Yeah , yeah , there you go . - [ Woman ] A long way . Care to see inside , sir ? Only a buck more . Well , that 's a bargain , isn 't it ? - Let 's have a look , shall we ? - Sure . Hi . Let 's see . Three dollars . There you go . [ Sam ] So , how much have you made so far ? About three hundred and twenty . I 'll go first . Thanks . Could you help me here ? Thanks . Thank you . Let 's go , lady . I 'm tryin 'to run a business here . Don 't risk it , Mary . It doesn 't look safe . Of course it is . We 've been takin people through all day . - Well , she balked at the Pirates of the Caribbean , so- - - Come on . You know what ? Keep the money , guys . We 're running late . Come on , Mary . Come on . Thanks , guys . - Well , Charles ? - Wait a minute , wait a minute . - Mary ? - I couldn 't see anything down there , but there was definitely something strange going on . - Look , what about the burn marks ? - The burn marks were real . Something landed there . Something landed there , but not that thing . So why that thing , hmm ? Why the cover-up ? - Go on , Mary . - There was something odd about those boys . Same with the man at the gate and the one in the woods . What , precisely ? All right , look , I know this doesn 't necessarily qualify as scientific evidence , but a woman is used to a certain response from men when we meet them : and from those boys , I didn 't even get the automatic- - Like when I was introduced to Sam , he did this . I did not do that . Based on what I was doing with my blouse , they should 've tried to look down my top , something . - They wouldn 't have had to try very hard . - Sam . We 're going to go to the TV station that broadcast those conflicting reports . Try something , and let me know if you get the same reaction , all right ? - Yes , sir . - Let 's go . - Did I really do that when we first met ? - You 're still doing it . Jarvis , stay by the car . All right , I 'll keep it up there . I 'll be waiting for you . [ Engine Starts ] That 's fine . The F.C.C. does not take misrepresentation lightly , Mr. Barnes . [ Siren Blares ] We made an explanation over the air , Mr. Cavanaugh . What else do you want ? We fell victim to a practical joke . It was a ... mistake . We 're only human , after all . Damn . Can I borrow your pen ? Well , I 've seen the site , and I find it difficult to imagine that a couple of farm boys ... could 've pulled off a hoax like that on their own . Are you implying that my station was in on it ? Be realistic . - Hold it ! - Uhh ! - [ Squishing Sound ] - He 's still moving . - Oh , my God . - Well , well , well . - What the hell is that ? - Our visitor , I presume . Careful . [ Hissing ] [ Grunting ] No , Sam ! I want to take it back . Give me that case . [ Squealing ] Thank you for your cooperation , Mr. Barnes . We will be in touch with you just as soon as I have completed the investigation . They 're on their way right now . [ Reporters ' Voices On Tape ] Let 's go , Sam . - [ Grunts ] - Oh . Sorry . - Zoom in , one . - This way . Camera three , pull out . What are these people doing- - Billy , they 're coming through . Stop them , Billy . [ Anchorman ] Let 's start with what you should do in an emergency . If you can stay calm , those around you will react calmer , especially if you have children . Once you are calm , then you can put a plan into place . Can I see some I.D. , please , sir ? Sam , you drive . Jarvis , get in the car ! Get away from the car , Officer . [ Grunting ] Get in the car . [ Tires Screeching ] - He 's on the car ! - [ Screams ] - Get off ! . - [ Groans ] - [ Screams ] - Get off ! . - Get him off ! . - [ Grunting ] - Whoa ! - [ Tires Screeching ] [ Horn Honking ] - Sam , get him off ! . - [ Officer Screams ] There they are ! - Sam ! - [ Tires Screeching ] [ Boy Yelling ] It 's the kid from the spaceship ! Get him off the car ! - [ Sam ] Jarvis ! - [ Mary ] Jarvis ! Help him ! [ Horn Honking , Tires Screeching ] Oh , my God ! Sam , are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm all right . - Good . [ Andrew ] Make sure Langley understands ... that it is crucial that we stop this before it can spread any further . I want that town sealed up completely . Put up a perimeter , roadblocks- - You can 't use local police because they have been compromised . Right ? Now , the troops that you do send in ... should be ordered to put up a challenge and respond at 1 00 yards , and put a bullet through anyone who comes closer than 50 yards . Now , get Holland to take a hazard response team ... and investigate the landing site . - There is no time to waste . - Mary . - Thanks . - Sure . They should exercise extreme caution , but I want to know everything . - Wasn 't supposed to happen like this . - What wasn 't ? First contact . - What 'd you expect , E.T. ? - [ Laughs ] No , but it would 've been nice . I never really liked that little troll . Look . He 's in his element now . He 's only really happy during a crisis . Yeah . Alive . [ Chuckles ] A little tense between you two , huh ? Yeah , well , he 's my father . [ Thumping ] - [ Thumping Continues ] - [ Hissing ] Wow . This is incredible . [ Laughing ] - Graves . - Quite incredible . There will be plenty of time for amazement later . Right now I urgently need facts . Okay , here 's one : it 's dead . - Are you sure ? - Huh ? No , uh , body heat , no electrical activity , and no movement . My guess is , if we vented the chamber , it 'd be pretty ripe in there . We gave it quite a jolt of electrical current . Probably vascular collapse , although most parasites , when they 're separated- - Dr. Sefton will define what we 're dealing with here . All right , how do you wanna handle this ? Well , we need to know how the creature is able to interface ... with the human nervous system . I think it 'd be best if we split into teams , each one focusing on a different aspect of the alien : biochemistry , physiology , reproduction . - Mm-hmm . Endocrinology . - Wait a minute . - We need to know- - - What we need to know is who we 're fighting ... and how to fight them . Is that clear to both of you ? Now , it 's 1 . ' 00 . In two hours , I 'm calling a meeting at the Office . Make sure you have something for me by then . [ Soldier Panting ] Brad . Cover . Okay , Jim , tape this , and get a water sample . I 'll be damned . - You want me to wait ? - Hey , man , I wouldn 't do that to you . Hey ! [ Laughing ] - Any trouble in Iowa ? - Not like you people had . I heard you had to take a couple of people out . These weren 't people . Not anymore . You shoot , they just keep on comin ' . - Any word on Dietman and Truly ? - [ Beeping ] Anyone told their wives yet ? - Not yet . - Hmm . [ Sam ] So what are we lookin 'at here ? It looked like something organic had eaten its way down into the earth ... below the water table . Now , whatever it was hiding in that fake saucer was moved . - All that was left was a hole filled with water . - What 's your guess ? How many of those things could 've been in that hole ? Well , based on the size of the cavity , could 've been thousands . Now , I don 't know if this counts for anything , but ... that kid said that 3 20 people had gone through that ship when we were there . That was about eleven hours ago . - What 's the population of Ambrose ? - [ Man ] 1 0,00 1 . - [ Andrew ] All right , Mary , let 's go . - Okay . Please keep in mind we were a little rushed . Here 's the creature , with an incision along its ventral surface . And the first thing that stands out ... is the structural complexity of its neocortex . In a human , brain tissue accounts for about 5 percent of total body mass , but in this creature- - and here 's the brain tissue here- - it accounts for about 60 percent . This black ... tentacle , which we saw jet across Barnes 'office , contains a probe which seems to act as some sort of interface ... between the creature and its host . The probe penetrates the brain , while these hooks , here and here , lock into the spinal column . - Together they override the human nervous system . - [ Slide Projector Clicks ] Now , wait , are you saying that these , uh , slugs ... are using us like puppets ? - Exactly . - You didn 't mention ... whether the creature has eyes- - does it ? We haven 't been able to locate any sensory organs . - Anything else ? - You know what 's really interesting is that ... we found human D.N.A. and protein inside the creature , which means they 're able to adapt themselves to whatever life form they 're riding on : which means , we breathe oxygen , so they breathe oxygen . - The two systems merge . - That 's a potential weakness . Can 't we exploit it ? What affects the host might also affect the parasite . The trick is to find something they 're vulnerable to and we 're not . Now , the people that were being ridden , they seemed stronger than normal . Yes , we think that they boost adrenalin production into their host , kind of like injecting nitro into a car 's fuel line to make the car run faster , but the engine will burn out sooner . It 's , uh , really quite a remarkable organism . It 's , uh , much more efficient than anything we have here on Earth . If you just look how elegant the cartilaginous structure is , it 's just incredible . It doesn 't use hemoglobin in oxygen transport . It uses a chlorophyll derivative . Jeez , Graves . I mean , he sounds like he wants to fuck the thing . - [ Laughter ] - [ Andrew ] Shut up , Holland . Dr. Sefton , do you have any idea how we should proceed ? Well , sir , this was just a preliminary postmortem- - When did you quit smoking , Jarvis ? Must 've left them in the car . - Stop him ! - [ Grunts ] - Alex . - [ Grunting Continues ] Jarvis ! Christ , he 's got one on him ! [ Groans ] Security ! Alex ! Go upstairs ! Secure the exit ! Bonnie , code 334 , main gate . - Main gate . - Come on , upstairs ! [ Creature Squealing ] [ Off-The-Hook Telephone Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] Alex ! - Where is it ? - I don 't know . [ Sam ] Harris , get him outta here . - Sam ? - We got him ! My guess is that thing must 've jumped onto whoever it ran into . Put your gun down , Sam , slowly , and take off your shirt . Thank you . Well , let 's find it . Search everybody . All right , everyone 's accounted for . - One of the alien- - - This was on Jarvis . It contains every emergency contingency ... that we 've drawn up dealing with this type of crisis since ' 59 . One of the alien life forms is loose in the building . We have to presume that it 's riding on the back of one of us . Sam , show them your back . Sam is clean . Mary . Holland , Gorman , Miss Haines , everybody . [ People Whispering , Murmuring ] Miss Haines . Everybody . What about you , sir ? Yeah , she 's right . You 're not exempt . [ Andrew ] Stop her ! Sam ! She 's headed into the east wing ! Come on ! - Miss Haines ! - [ Screaming ] Miss Haines ! Miss Haines ! Come back here ! [ Miss Haines Snarling ] [ Grunting , Groaning ] [ Screams ] [ Stun Gun Charging ] - [ Stun Gun Zapping ] - [ Creature Squealing ] - They 're down in the kitchen ! - All right ! I got your backup ! [ Sam ] Damn ! I lost it ! Forget it , forget it . I lost it . It was too quick . It went up through there . I want that thing found tonight . - Turn this building upside down , but find it ! - Miss Haines ? Sam , go get yourself cleaned up . I want every second of Jarvis ' time accounted for . I want to know everything he was up to since we left Iowa . Go get a medic , will you ? [ Andrew ] Oh , God . [ Medical Machinery Beeping ] He 's been like this since you brought him in . In many ways , he 's exhibiting classic withdrawal symptoms , much like you 'd find in a drug addict . [ Holland ] Are you saying he was actually addicted to having that thing on him ? No , he 's saying that the presence of the thing ... satisfies some need or other . Thanks , Doc . Jarvis is cold turkey and Miss Haines is in a coma . - Are all of the victims gonna react this way ? - How would you react , Holland ? One moment you have this huge brain , the next moment you don 't : just think of it . The job would be a hell of a lot easier if they had a live specimen to work with . [ Graves ] What do you think ... these things are ? [ Mary ] Let 's have a look . Wow . They almost look like antennae . - What are they receiving ? - Or transmitting , for that matter . [ Mary ] Radar , maybe , or sonar signals , like bats . You think maybe that 's how the , uh , aliens are able to recognize each other ? [ Beeping ] - [ Beeping Intensifies ] - [ Gasping ] [ Gasping , Coughing ] [ Beeping Continues ] - [ Jarvis Sighs ] - [ High-Pitched Tone ] Spare change ? [ Man ] Uh , yeah ? - You the manager of the building ? - Yeah . - Can I help you ? - Need to get inside the apartment of NeilJarvis . Uh ... Yeah , sure . Just a second . Be right with you . - Do you have a crowbar ? - No , I got the keys . Up this way . [ Manager ] Anybody here ? Hello ? These arrived this morning for Mr.Jarvis. I , uh- - - I let the delivery people in . - Gimme a hand here . Uh , yeah , sure . Huh . Iowa . Wonder what that 's all about ? What the hell are those things ? [ Groaning ] [ Woman Announcer ] Back here in Washington , the President 's scheduled appearance at the digital age conference ... has drawn harsh criticism from Senator Allen , who categorized the visit as blatant grandstanding . [ Man ] Make sure the magnetometer 's cranked up early . We don 't want any delays . - Has headquarters given us the name of our post standards yet ? - Yes , sir . All agents confirm post assignments , please . Gonna need more agents on that balcony and all along this perimeter . - Okay . - Sam . Long time no see . Good to see you too , Bruce . This is Evan Greenberg , one of my agents . How are you , Evan ? So , what brings you down here ? I understand the President is scheduled to make an appearance here later today . Yeah , if everything goes as planned . Well , there 's a situation developing that I think you need to know about . Can we talk in private ? Yeah . Come on . [ Panting ] Okay , now , Sam , what 's this all about ? - Aaah ! [ Grunting ] What the hell are you doing ? - [ Growling ] - [ Hissing ] - [ Grunting ] [ Hissing Continues ] [ Squishing ] [ Men Talking ] [ Woman On P.A. ] Please take your seats in the main theater . The opening session of the conference is about to begin . - Good to see you . - Welcome , Mr. President . Right this way . Get him . Alpha One , he 's headed your way . [ Woman Grunts ] Why don 't you watch where you 're going- - Hey ! Bruce , you wanna tell me what 's happening here , please ? - [ Men Shouting , Grunting ] - [ Machine Gun Fire ] - [ Man # 1 ] Clear ? - [ Man # 2 ] That 's it . - Yeah , he 's dead . - [ Men Talking ] Are you all right , sir ? [ Panting , Coughing ] Andrew . What in God 's name is going on ? - That 's him ! - Here ! - Stop ! - Hold it ! Stop ! - Jesus ! - [ Grunts ] - [ Creature Squealing ] - [ Agent ] Hit him again ! - [ Sam Groaning , Grunting ] - [ Squealing Continues ] Watch out ! Hold up . [ Holland ] Jesus , that was close . - You think he would 've shot me ? - Of course he would have . Get him to the lab . [ Siren Blaring ] - [ People Talking ] - [ Woman ] Sixth degree- - It 's dilating . - [ Man ] Coming back with D.N.A. analysis . - [ Talking Continues ] [ Holland ] What does all this mean ? [ Graves ] Uh , top line is Sam 's heart rate , bottom is the alien 's . [ Mary ] They 're identical . Brain waves too . Their nervous systems are linked . Pulse is 1 20 . Blood pressure , 1 40 over 90 . Temperature , 1 03 . Creature 's running him hot . Could you move the fluoroscope over to the right profile , please ? - What 's this ? - Some kind of electromagnetic signal . We thought it was just background interference , but it 's coming from the parasite . - You were right , then . Radar . - Yeah . - Let me hear it . - It 's too high a frequency . Wake him up . I 'm going in there . Sir , I don 't think that 's a good idea , ' I don 't think it 's safe in there . It 's Sam , Lawrence . Hmm . - Sir . - It 's all right . Wake him up , Jim . Bring me that stool . Sam . Sam , can you hear me ? Sam isn 't here anymore , Andrew . - You know me . - And your dead wife . And Mary . [ Snickers ] [ Squealing Quietly ] You wouldn 't believe the fantasies my host has about you , Mary . - Would you like me to tell them to you ? - [ Andrew ] We would not . I will ask the questions , and if you do not cooperate ... I 'll administer electric shocks , and you will die . Then I will stop the heart of this host , and it will die . [ Quiet Squealing Continues ] - [ High-Pitched Tone ] - Get him back ! - He 's gone flat-line ! - [ Graves ] Two CCs of epinephrine ! Two CCs of epinephrine , stat ! I. V. - [ Woman ] It 's back ! - He 's back , he 's back . Hold that epinephrine . - All right . - Amazing . My God , it has total control . Sam , why have they come here ? What do they want ? Sam ? I warned you . - Shock him ! - [ Electricity Crackling ] - [ Creature Squealing Loudly ] - Ohh ! - [ Squealing Continues ] - Sam ? [ Crackling Continues ] - [ Squealing Intensifies ] - Sam ? - Oh , Jesus ! - Sam ! [ Crackling Stops ] - Sam . - [ Panting ] I acknowledge you can hurt me , but each shock you administer shortens your son 's life . Do you understand ? Of course I understand . Now you answer me . Why are you here ? Our previous hosts ceased to be useful . You 're stronger than they were : you will last longer . [ Andrew ] All right . How many are you ? One . Sir , there may be semantic differences . Its concept of personal identity may be different from ours . [ Andrew ] No . No . How many are you ? One . [ Electricity Crackling ] [ Loud Squealing ] Sam , do you have any idea how many of them there are ? - [ Crackling Continues ] - It was thinking " one . " - It doesn 't know why you keep- - - [ Crackling Stops ] [ Squishing Sounds ] - [ Squishing Stops ] - Always giving orders , aren 't you , Andrew ? Always telling people how to run their lives . Maybe that 's why you 're so lonely . Did you ever think of that ? Maybe that 's why your son resents you so much . You won 't be lonely when you 're one of us : no one will be . - For God 's sakes , tell us what you want . - Peace . - [ Electricity Crackling ] - [ Loud Squealing ] - [ Crackling Stops ] - [ Squealing Stops ] [ Squishing Sounds ] Say good-bye to your son , Andrew . Sam . - [ Beeping ] - [ Graves ] Oh , Jesus , it 's killing him . - Get it off him ! Get it off ! . - [ Doctors Talking ] - [ Electricity Crackling ] - [ Andrew Gasps ] [ Loud Squealing ] [ Squealing , Crackling Continue ] - Sam ! - [ Squealing Continues ] [ Squishing Sound ] [ Squealing ] It 's gone . [ Sighing ] Welcome back . I 'm sorry you had to go through that , son . Those things I said , Dad- - It wasn 't me talking . Come on . Do you remember what happened ? I was aware the whole time . I was conscious of what I was doing , what was happening to me , but- - It was like having one of those dreams where you 're paralyzed . I mean , no matter how much I tried to move or scream , I just couldn 't . It had total control over me . It 's like an open book to them . They could read everything that was in my mind- - my thoughts , my fears , my memories , everything . Did they have thoughts ? I remember something about ... their ship . It wasn 't a ship , though . It was a- - a nerve center , a hive . Have to get back to it . I have to share information with the others . You know where it is ? Do you ? No , I 'm , I 'm not sure where , but- - Get some rest . Get some rest . Let me know as soon as you can when I can try again . Say good-bye to your son , Andrew . - [ Electricity Crackling ] - Ah , that 's enough of that . Take it off . Sir , the parasites run their hosts ... at a body temperature higher than normal , which gives them an identifiable heat signature . And we have been able to track that identifiable heat signature ... through thermal imaging from satellite sweeps and R.P.B. reconnaissance flights . Run the I.P.V. recording . Now , this is Ambrose , and those red areas are creature-controlled . Give me maximum magnification here , will you , please . I want to show you something . Now , these are human beings with creatures on their backs . - What 's the green dot ? - That is a human being without a creature . He 's surrounded by parasite-controlled hosts . And now he too has a parasite on his back . [ Sam Crying Out ] [ Sam Sobbing ] I won 't ! I 'm not coming ! [ Sobbing Continues ] I 'm sorry , Dad . I 'm sorry ! Get him off me ! Just get off of me ! [ Panting ] - Come on , now . - [ Sobbing ] It 's okay . It 's okay , Sam . It 's okay . Okay , Sam . - Get it off me ! - Okay , it 's off you . It 's not on you anymore . It 's not on you anymore . Okay ? Okay ? You 're okay . You 're okay . - I still- - I still feel it . - It 's gone . It 's gone . Shh . Shhh . Okay . Okay . Shh . [ Panting ] Okay , okay . Shh . Shh . You 're all right . You 're all right . Have we been in contact with the governor ? - What about the Iowa National Guard ? - No , there 's no point , sir . Those troops will have been infiltrated : you have to go in on a Federal level . Our nearest troops are the 1 st Infantry Division out of Fort Riley . How quickly can we move on this ? We can have a rapid response tactic force in place within 1 2 hours . I recommend , sir , we go in at night to take advantage of the thermal imaging . Do it . [ Soldier Panting ] Wait ! I see something . [ Quiet Hissing , Getting Louder ] [ Soldier Groans ] - [ Hissing Continues ] - Shit . [ Soldier ] Move out ! Let 's go . [ Soldiers Talking ] Let 's go , let 's go . Come on . Comin ' through . Oh , shit . [ President ] General , what 's this ? This is a thermal image feed . It 's from Lieutenant Abbey 's unit , sir . - [ Soldier ] Shoot ' em ! Kill ' em ! - [ Soldier ] They 're just kids . - They 're using children ? - [ Soldier ] Shoot ' em anyway ! We cannot think of them any longer as children : they are the enemy . - [ Soldier ] Move , move , move ! - [ Soldier ] Where are they coming from ? What is this- - [ Soldier ] We have two more . [ Soldiers Talking ] Take that half-ton out ! Negative , sir ! General ? They 're here to see you , sir . Put ' em in the office . I 'll be in in a minute . This way , men . [ Soldier ] 2-5-5-1 . Very good , sir . We 've lost satellite linkup , but we have Lt. Abbey on audio . Situation 's under control now . We 'll be bringing the children into the holding area shortly , then moving on to sector seven . - Thank you , gentlemen . - So far , so good . What 's goin ' on here ? Captain Earley , sir , Iowa National Guard , Camp Dodge . We 're here to provide back-up support . I didn 't hear anything about you people being called in here . Get me Washington on the line . I 'd rather you didn 't . [ Men Talking ] - [ Sam ] So did you find a way to kill these things ? - [ Mary ] No , not yet . We 're trying everything . Different bacteria , viruses , radiation . But so far , we 've found nothing that doesn 't kill the host . See the one looking at us ? He 's wearing the slug we took off you . He 's just been sittin like that for hours . [ Sam ] Yeah , they were merging . It 's how they communicate with each other . - [ Doctor ] Oh , yeah ? - They exchange chemical signatures . We 're ready , Dr. Graves . We should 've thought of that . Ants communicate in the same way . - Where 'd you get the second parasite ? - Just watch . We set up a keyboard in there in case they want to talk to us . Vargas , note the time . [ Squealing ] - Does the old man know about this ? - We wanted to make sure . Here we go again . [ Vargas ] This is how they reproduce . - Second adult parasite in minutes . - Vargas , get the old man on the line . [ Shrieks ] - [ Vargas ] Watch what they do to the little one . - [ Shrieking ] - [ Hissing ] - [ Shrieking ] [ Shrieking Stops ] The new one knows me . I 've got General Morgan reporting in . Andrew Nivens here , General . How is it going down there ? [ Morgan ] It was touch and go for a while there , but we think the worst is over . - It 's your son . - Hang on , Sam . We 've got 7 0 % of the area contained , and we 've been able to keep casualties fairly low . Thank you , sir . Would you take off your shirt , please , and turn your back to the camera ? - Is this a joke ? - No , it 's not a joke . Take off your shirt . I don 't take my orders from you , sir . Order him to take off his shirt . Sam , go on . I 'm sorry , General . Would you humor us for a moment , please ? God . [ Hangs Up Phone ] There 's no signal coming in . All right , what 's going on ? Andrew ? The transmission isn 't lost , sir . The transmission has been cut off because General Morgan has been taken , and we can assume that his troops are now our enemy . We 've been getting reports from all over that the situation has been contained . The reports are faked . We 're being manipulated . I have just been told ... [ Sighs ] that their numbers are increasing ... infinitely more than we had anticipated . We 've lost a town , sir . Now we 've lost an army . They 're capable of transmitting not just intelligence , but memory ... from one body to the next just by coming into physical contact with one another . And the new one knew Sam just as if it had been the one riding on his back ? - Yes . - How long does it take the creature to prepare for division ? Twelve hours . So , let 's assume we started with a thousand of them . Now , we 'll be conservative . That 's , uh , one day , four thousand . Two days , 1 6 thousand . In two weeks , there would be- - More than 250 billion . You okay ? I don 't know why your father picked me . - I 'm not gonna be able to find the answer . - Mary , wait . He knows what he 's doing . You 'll find something . No , Mary , you will . Thanks , Sam . He 's given everyone a few hours off to recuperate . I don 't have time to go back to the hotel : I 'm just gonna go back to the lab . No , wait . Look , I just live a few blocks from here . Okay . [ Meows ] - That wasn 't very friendly . - I wouldn 't take it personally . He 's kind of a prima donna . - How about if I make a fire ? - That 'd be great . - Is that okay for him to go out like that ? - Oh , yeah , yeah . He comes and goes . - Is this your mom ? - Yeah . She 's pretty . She died about a year after that picture was taken . - And what was it like growing up with him ? - Boot camp . I 'll bet . Whenever he was working at home , which was most of the time , he 'd give me a quarter for every hour I could keep quiet . One day , I remember it was a Saturday morning , I decided I wasn 't gonna say anything until he did , even if it took all weekend . But he never said anything . And I don 't think he even noticed . So , how much did you make ? - Oh , uh- - - [ Chuckling ] About 1 2 bucks . [ Beeping ] Shit . It 's the old man . [ Ringing ] Yeah ? Yeah , she 's here with me . Yeah . Okay . Sam , are you all right ? Yeah , I just dropped the phone . Look who turned out to be a sweetie after all . [ Meows ] So ? So , we have to go back . Maybe we could stay another ... [ Exhales ] ten minutes . [ Chuckling ] Don 't move . [ Squishing Sound ] - [ Hissing ] - [ Yelling ] [ Squealing ] Why 'd you do that , Sam ? What 's the matter , Sam ? Isn 't this what you wanted from the day we met ? You and I together . You can 't hurt her , can you ? But I can . [ Panting ] [ Meows ] [ Growling ] Mary got it off your cat ? Jesus . They 're taking her back to their hive . I 'm positive . - If they 've taken her back there , there 's nothing we can do about it . - I 'm going after her . No , you 're not ! It 's a goddamned suicide mission . I won 't allow it . - Dad , you 're fighting an enemy you don 't understand ! = Sam , I 'm not adding your name ... - to the casualty list . - I have to find their hive and get inside . - If I can get inside , I can get information . - Sam ! Sam . In 1 2 hours , that whole area 's gonna be a war zone . You 're not thinking rationally . Dad , I 'm sick of thinking rationally ! I 'm going after her ! Do you intend to help me or not ? [ High-Pitched Tone ] [ Man On TV ] The roads are completely jammed ... - It 's receiving okay . - amidst rumors that Minneapolis has been invaded . Civil authorities are fighting to keep the situation under control . But as you can see , they are not having much luck . - Looting in the downtown- - - It 's good , but the frequency still isn 't matching . Over a dozen traffic fatalities . [ Woman On TV ] So , what safeguards can be taken in order to protect you and your family ? Keep your doors and windows locked . Don 't let anyone into your home , even if they appear to be a friend . - And if you absolutely have to venture outside , - Can we get started ? stay away from crowds . We recommend that you stay tuned to this station for further updates . Now I know that there 's some sort of a hive ... that they have to go back to on a regular basis . - Some central source . Intelligence replenishing . - Exactly . Okay , let 's run this . Now , I 've had the analysts sort through all the thermal-image data that we 've gathered ... in order to plot the expansion of the alien colony . This is a satellite picture of Iowa the night the U.F.O. was first sighted . Here , day one . Now watch . The irregular orange shape represents the spread of the colony ... over the last five days . Now , what you 'd expect , if it 's necessary to stay close to the hive , and given the topography of Iowa , is that the shape would be roughly circular . So , we rationalized it into three overlapping circles . Could you do that , please ? If we shrink these circles back , we find the location of the hive at different times . [ Andrew ] And each time , the hive is on the river . That could be how they moved it . All right , this is where it all started . This is where the hive is now . Des Moines . Makes sense . High population density , and it 'd be easier to defend . We 've narrowed its location to a ten block radius within the downtown city center . That 's where she is . That 's where Mary is , I know it . Show me the projected size of the colony in the next 2 4 hours . We 'll parachute in tonight . [ Sighs ] - You have six hours . - We 'll need eight . You 've got eight hours . You people got a very tight eight-hour window to pull this off . - After that , you 're on your own . Got it ? - Yes . - Opening drill . - [ Together ] Look , reach , pull ! - Good . - [ Graves ] Hey ! Hey ! Wait up , wait , wait ! - Hey ! - Oh , Graves . Graves . I just wanted to tell you we jerry-rigged these transmitters ... so that they 'll send out the same frequency that the aliens do . You know , it 's how they recognize each other . And , uh , if you don 't get too close , they 'll think you 're one of them . - Beautiful . - Thanks . Thanks , Graves . Hey , Graves , I think you 're a genius , man . Look , I just wanted to apologize for that comment I made back in the room . - You know , when I made that bad joke about fuckin ' the thing- - - Holland ! Let 's go ! - Thanks . Thanks ! - Good luck . [ Man ] We 'll have to use Army vehicles ... in this quadrant here . Mm-hmm . We have to cover this terrain quickly . [ Door Closes ] [ Gunfire ] Danny ? Danny ? Danny ! Danny ! [ Screaming ] Danny ! Danny ! Danny ? - Somebody , help ! - Hey . Forget it . Forget it . Forget it , Alex . No ! [ Screams ] Jesus , I don 't wanna end up like that . Trapped inside of my own body . He wants to merge . [ Hissing ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Creature Squeals ] Remind me to thank Graves . [ Man On TV ] The President 's announcement early this morning ... has sent shock waves throughout the country . [ Man ] They should be at the city center now , sir . Andrew ? [ TV ] In response , the President has declared a state of national emergency , instituting martial law in all major urban centers . In related news , the financial world was quick to respond- - [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ] [ Woman On P.A. ] All units designated primary or secondary should proceed to level P2 . All other units should assemble on the first floor . - This has to be it . - Let 's go ' round back . [ Vehicle Approaching ] - Hold it there . - [ Sam ] It 's down there . - I should be going with you . - Just give me 20 minutes . Sam ! How will I know it 's really you ? If it 's not , you know what to do . [ Hissing Sound ] [ Voices Whispering ] [ Whispering Continues ] [ Sam 's Voice ] Share information with the others . [ Whispering Continues ] Sam , why are they here ? What do they want ? My thoughts , my fears . My memories . You won 't be lonely when you 're one of us . No one will be . Everything you try to hide from yourself . [ Mary 's Voice ] Isn 't this what you always wanted ? [ Sam 's Voice ] You wouldn 't believe the fantasies my host has about you , Mary . [ Mary ] You and I together . - [ Mary ] You can 't hurt her , can you ? But I can . - [ Sam ] Get it off me ! - [ Mary ] It 's not on you . - [ Sam ] Get it off me ! [ Explosion , Screaming ] [ High-Pitched Tone ] [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] [ Creature Squealing ] [ Squealing Continues ] Come on . Don 't move , don 't move , don 't move . [ Hissing , Squealing ] [ Gasps , Coughing ] Fuck . [ Coughing ] - You all right ? - [ Panting ] There 's something you 've gotta see . It 's important , Sam . [ Sam ] Wa- - Wait . Stay close to me . This is why they wanted me . Jesus , Mary , what is this place ? While we 've been studying them , they 've been studying us . More dead bodies . Great . Can we get out of here ? He 's alive ! Get him out ! Get him out of there . This is what we 've been looking for . ' something to kill the parasite but not the boy . So why did it die ? He must have contracted something fatal to his parasite . He was sealed off in here so he wouldn 't infect the others . This is it . - [ Coughing ] - Come on . [ Machine Gun Fire ] [ Screaming ] - It 's Alex . Take the kid . - [ Gunfire Continues ] [ Screaming ] [ Whispering ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Squealing ] [ Sam ] Alex ! I got her ! Let 's go ! Alex ! - [ Gasping ] - [ Hissing ] Aah ! Help ! [ Screaming ] Help me ! Sam , come on ! We can 't help him . - Come on ! Come on ! - [ Alex Screaming ] [ Sam ] Come on , Mary . [ Boy Breathing Heavily ] - [ Mary Panting ] - Come on . Come on . We gotta get up to the roof . Go . Go , go , go , go ! This 'll keep ' em busy . [ Beeping ] [ Explosion , Yelling ] [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Alarm Continues ] - [ Voice On P.A. ] Code eight . All units to south plaza . Power supply . Main power supply . - [ Mary Coughing ] Can you stand up ? - [ Boy ] Yeah . - Do you think you can walk ? - Mm-hmm . They 'll pick us up from the roof . Sam , they 're coming ! Go ! Come on ! - [ Mary ] Sam ! - Get outta here ! [ Squealing ] - [ Yells ] - [ Squealing Continues ] - Take the kid . - Okay , I got him . [ Growling , Yelling ] Alex ? You weren 't planning on leaving without me now , were you , buddy ? Oh , Alex ! Go , get to the roof . Get him to the roof . Let 's talk about it , Alex . - [ Beeping ] - Here , kitty , kitty . [ Beeping Continues ] [ Beeping ] I 'll talk to you , Sam . I know you 're in here . [ Beeping Faster ] If I have to look for you too long , it 's gonna really piss me off . [ Beeping Very Fast ] [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ] Aaah ! Where are ya ? You lousy son of a bitch ! You said you 'd help me ! [ Screaming ] You 're no better than your father ! [ Screaming Continues , Gasping ] - [ Hissing Sound ] - Help me ! - Alex ? - [ Groaning ] Oh , God ! Come on ! Come on ! - Alex , man , fight it ! - [ Groaning ] - Fight it , man , fight it ! - How could he , Sam ? You couldn 't ! [ Groaning ] Please , Sam , get it off ! . Alex ? - Get it off ! . Get it off ! . - Alex ! [ Yelling ] Not very smart , are you , Sam ? [ Yelling ] Pick him up . Bring him here . It 's safe , it 's safe ! Come on ! Where 're the others ? You never did have a right hand , Sam . - [ Grunts ] - Come here . [ Gasps ] [ Screams ] - We gotta go ! Where 's Holland ? - He didn 't make it . [ Gunfire ] - You all right ? - Yeah . Get Nivens on the radio . [ Graves ] The boy has encephalitis , which causes inflammation of the brain tissue . It 's not fatal to humans if it 's treated in a few days . But the aliens are 60 % brain matter , so it should kill them first , allowing us to save the host . - How long has it been ? - Thirty-three minutes . There 's still the question of disease vectors : how the disease would spread . - Mosquitos . - Yes . [ Graves ] Mosquitos . We can just release infected batches over the areas controlled by the aliens . - [ Squealing Sound ] - Good . [ Squealing Continues ] - [ Graves ] Oh , Jesus . - [ Exhales ] - [ Squealing Continues ] - [ Sam ] That 's disgusting . [ Graves ] Thirty-three minutes , eighteen seconds . That 's it . We 've done it . [ Woman ] Yes , but how do we get to them all ? They 've spread so far . We don 't need to . There 's only one alien . We 've been thinking in terms of millions , but it 's a single creature with a million parts . The same way they transmit information to each other , they 'll transmit the disease . It 'll set off a chain reaction . - We can infect the entire colony as if it were a single body . - Perfect . - [ Talking Quietly ] - We 've got General Morgan coming in from Fort Riley . Bring the camera over here , please . Well , we 're all clean , sir . Seems to be working . The medics are administering the antitoxins throughout the area . Most of my men are sick as hell , but the aliens are dying . [ Cheering ] [ Applause Continues ] [ Siren Blaring ] [ Man ] P1 to P3 , all clear . Anything ? - [ Phone Rings ] - Yes ? Yeah , they 're on their way down ? Good . All clear down here . What were they trying to do here ? Rebuild their home . Careful , sir . [ Andrew ] My God . Ohh ! [ Grunting ] [ Soldier ] Are you okay down there ? [ Sam ] Soldier , down here . - Oh . - You okay ? [ Chuckling ] I 'm fine , fine . Sorry . I mean , silly of me . I should 've been more careful . - Check him out , please . - He 's clean . - Sorry , sir . - No , no , no , please , don 't apologize . We 're going to need to take samples of the structure . It 's a pity we couldn 't save it . What we might have learned , hmm ? Well , I-I 've seen enough . Thank you . - [ Soldiers Talking ] - I 'm glad I saw it . I don 't think I would 've believed it was really over . - [ Sam ] How 're you doin ' ? - [ Mary ] I still can 't believe I slept for two whole days . Excuse me , sir . Dr. Nivens forgot his cane . [ Andrew ] Give me a hand up . - There you go . - Thanks very much . Here we go . [ Helicopter Engine Starts ] - Come on , soldier , on the double . - [ Yelling ] Call in emergency services now ! Hello , Sam . I can fly a helicopter . Perfectly . You never told me how good it felt , Sam . I had no idea a man could feel such a sense of freedom . - My God ! - When did you take him ? - Back in the ship . - We checked . Well , I explained we had to lower my body temperature , so we did . - We learn from our mistakes . - I want you to land this helicopter . [ Chuckles ] Or what ? Oh , a gun . Automatic pilot . What are you going to do , Sam ? Do you think that you are capable of killing your father ? He 'd want me to . Possibly . But the question is ... can you ? Help ! Give me- - [ Gunshots ] [ Both Grunting ] You can 't win , Sam . [ Yells ] Oh , Sam , give it up . [ Squealing ] Sam ! Sam ! [ Sam Groaning ] [ Sirens Blaring ] [ Sirens Continue ] [ Man ] Injuries comin 'in ! Dad ? Dad ! Come on , man , don 't do this to me . Don 't do this to me , Dad ! Stop shouting , Sam , for God 's sakes . You know how much I hate it . I can 't believe you actually shot me . - What would you have done ? - Oh , I would have shot you , of course . But I never dreamt you were that kind of man . Oh . Oh , God . - Get out of here , Sam . I 'm fine . - [ Mary ] There you are . - It 's okay , I 'm going with you . - No , go on . Take her for a cup of coffee . Exercise a fantasy . Okay , Dad . That was the last one , Mary . You don 't know that . - Yes , I do . - [ Paramedic ] Excuse me . Have a good time . [ Chuckling ] Guess you exobiologists finally earned your keep . - Yeah , I guess so . - [ Siren Blaring ] When I was inside that thing , it was like hearing a thousand voices inside my head . Yeah , I know . You were there , Sam . Your memories , your thoughts , your feelings . Everything you try to hide from yourself . Yeah . I guess you know how I feel about you , then . - Down to the last gory detail . - [ Chuckles ] - Kind of gives you an unfair advantage , don 't you think ? - Oh , yeah ? Why 's that ? I mean , you know so much about me . It would take me forever to learn that much about you . No , no , see , I think , actually , it helps us , because if you look at it from a sociological point of view , you could argue that men take a lot longer to open up than women do . So , we should be right on track in about , oh , 40 or 50 years . [ Chuckles ] [ Mary Laughs ]

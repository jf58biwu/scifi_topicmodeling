 Doug ? Are you all right ? You 're dreaming . Doug ? Was it about Mars ? is that better ? My poor baby . This is getting to be an obsession . Was she there ? Who ? The one you told me about . The brunette . Lori ... I can 't believe you 're jealous of a dream . - Who is she ? - Nobody . - Nobody ? What 's her name ? - l don 't know . - Tell me ! - l don 't know . It 's not funny . You dream about her every night . - l 'm always back in the morning . - Let me go ! Come on , baby . You know you 're the girl of my dreams . - You mean it ? - You know I do . I 'll give you something to dream about . ... said that space-based weapons are our only defence against the Southern Bloc . More violence on Mars : Terrorists demanding independence halted turbinium ore extraction . Kuato 's Freedom Brigade admitted the bombing , which attempted to reopen the Pyramid Mines . Mars ' military restored order with minimum force . All damage to the facility was repaired within hours . Mars Administrator Vilos Cohaagen said troops would be used to ensure full production . No wonder you get nightmares . You always watch the news . - Lori ? Let 's do it . - Do what ? - Move to Mars . - Must you spoil a lovely morning ? Just think about it . We 've been through this . You 'd hate Mars . It 's dry , it 's ugly , it 's boring . I mean , really ... - Revolution could break out soon . - Cohaagen says it 's a few rebels . You believe him ? Okay . Forget about it . Absolutely not . Mars was colonised by the Northern Bloc . Our entire war effort depends on their turbinium . We 'll not give it away to some lazy mutants who think they own Mars . - Maybe we should take a trip . - Were alien artifacts in the mine ? There are better places . What about Saturn ? I wish it was true . Our tourist industry could use a boost . Kuato spread this rumour to undermine trust in the government . We could take a long space cruise , where there 's nothing to do . - What do you say ? - l 'm late , Lori . Sweetheart ... Doug ? It 's hard being in a new town , but let 's give it a chance . Don 't you understand ? I feel like I was meant for something more . I want to do something with my life . Be somebody . You are somebody . You 're the man I love . 'Bye . Have a nice day . You are now entering a safety zone . No unauthorised weapons allowed beyond this point . You are now entering a safety zone . No unauthorised weapons allowed beyond this point . Do you dream of an ocean vacation , but you can 't float the bill ? Did you always want to climb the mountains of Mars , but now you 're over the hill ? Then buy the memory of a vacation at Rekall. lt 's cheaper and safer . Don 't let life pass you by . Call us , for the memory of a lifetime ! For the memory of a lifetime Rekall , Rekall , Rekall . Harry ? You ever hear of Rekall ? Where they sell fake memories ? Oh , " Rekall , Rekall , Rekall ... " Thinking of going there ? - Maybe . - Well , don 't . A friend of mine tried it and nearly got lobotomised . - No shit ? - Don 't fuck with your brain , pal ! I guess not . - Hello . - Good afternoon . - Welcome to Rekall . - Doug Quaid. I 've an appointment . - Bob ? Doug Quaid is here . - l 'll be right out . - Just a minute , Mr. Quaid . - Thank you . Doug ! Bob McClane , good to see you . Come on in , it 's through here . - Have a seat . - Thank you . - You wanted memories of .. ? - Mars . - Yeah , Mars ... - ls that a problem ? To be honest , you 'd be much happier with one of our Saturn cruises . - Everybody raves about them . - Not Saturn. I said Mars . Okay , you 're the boss . Mars it is . Let me see ... The basic Mars package will run you 899 credits . That 's for two weeks of memories with every detail . - Longer trips cost more . - What 's in the two-week package ? With Rekall , you get first-class memories . Private cabin , Hilton suite , plus all the sights . Mt . Pyramid , the Grand Canals , and of course , Venusville . - How real does it seem ? - As real as any memory you have . - Don 't bullshit me ! - lt 's true . If not , you get your money back . What about the guy you lobotomised ? Did he get a refund ? That 's ancient history . Nowadays , Rekall is safer than any rocket . Here 's the statistics . A real holiday is a pain in the butt . Lost luggage , lousy weather , crooked taxi drivers . Travel with Rekall , and everything is perfect . So , what do you say ? - All right . - Smart move . While you fill out this form , I 'll tell you about some options . - No options . - Fine . But can I ask you something ? What is it that 's exactly the same on every vacation ? - l give up . - You ! Wherever you go , it 's always the same you . Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself . It 's wild. lt 's the latest thing in travel : " The Ego Trip " . - l 'm not interested . - You 'll love it , Doug . You get a choice of alternate identities . Why go to Mars as a tourist ? - Why not a playboy or famous jock ? - How much is " Secret Agent " ? Let me tantalize you ... You are a top operative on your most important mission . People try to kill you . You meet a beautiful exotic woman . - Go on . - l don 't want to spoil it for you . But you get the girl , kill the bad guys , and save the entire planet . You tell me , isn 't that worth a measly 300 credits ? is this your first trip ? Don 't worry , we hardly ever fuck up . Good evening , Doug . I 'm Doctor Lull . Ernie , patch in matrix 62B-37 . - Would you like some alien stuff ? - Sure . Why not ? - Two-headed monsters ? - We have alien artifacts now . - That 's wild . - Yeah , they 're a million years old . - That 's a new one ! " Blue sky " . - Been married long ? - Eight years . - So you want some hanky-panky ? - Not really . Mars fascinates me . - All systems go . Ready for Dreamland ? I 'll ask some questions , to adjust the programme . Answer honestly for more enjoyment . - Sexual orientation ? - Hetero . How do you like your women ? Blonde , brunette , redhead ? Brunette . Slim , athletic , voluptuous ? Athletic . Demure , aggressive , sleazy ? Be honest . Sleazy . Demure . 41 A , Ernie . He 'll have a wild time . He won 't want to come back . That 's for sure . So , what do you say ? I 'm not sure . And I don 't get a souvenir ! For a few more credits , you can get T-shirts , snapshots , or letters ... Bob ! You 'd better get down here . - l 'm with a very important client . - lt 's another schizoid embolism . - l 'll be right back . - Mr. McClane ? - What 's wrong ? - Don 't let her leave ! You 're dead , all of you ! - You blew my cover ! - Can 't you do a simple implant ? - We hit a memory cap . - They 'll kill you all ! What the hell is he talking about ? Mr. Quaid , calm down ! My name is not Quaid . - Untie me now . - Ernie , grab his leg . Hold him ! Are you all right ? Listen to me ... He 's been going on about Mars . He 's been there . Use your head , bitch . He 's just acting secret agent . That 's not possible . We haven 't implanted it yet ! - Oh shit ! - l 've been trying to tell you . - Someone erased his memory . - Excuse me ... Someone ? It 's the fucking Agency ! - Shut up ! - Bob , the client 's gone . Here 's what we 'll do . Erase any memory of us or Rekall . - l 'll do what I can . - Dump him in a cab . You help him . I 'll erase his file. lf anyone asks , we 've never heard of Douglas Quaid . - Where am I ? - You 're in a JohnnyCab . - l mean , what am I doing here ? - Please rephrase the question . - How did I get in this taxi ? - The door opened , you got in . Hell of a day , isn 't it ? is this okay ? Thank you for taking JohnnyCab . Hope you enjoyed it . Hey , Quaid ! - How was your trip to Mars ? - What trip ? You went to Rekall , remember ? I told you not to , but you did . - What are you , my father ? - l 'll buy you a drink . I 'm already late ... Let 's go get that drink . What 's going on ? What did I do wrong ? - You blabbed , Quaid . About Mars . - But I know nothing about Mars ! You should have listened to me . - Harry , you 've got me mixed up . - No , you got yourself mixed up . Hit it , and serve , and shift ... And stroke , and hit it , and serve , and shift . And stroke ... very good ! Perfect form . And serve ... Hi , honey . What are you doing ? - Some men tried to kill me . - Muggers ? No , they were spies or something . And Harry ... get down ! - Harry from work was the boss . - Take it easy . - Why would spies want to kill you ? - l don 't know . - Something to do with Mars . - Mars ? It sounds crazy , but I went to Rekall ... You went to those brain butchers ? I got a trip to Mars ... Forget Rekall , these guys tried to kill me . - Nobody tried to kill you . - They did ! But I killed them ! Listen , those Rekall assholes have fucked up your mind . - You 're having paranoid delusions . - You call this a delusion ? Doug ... I 'm going to call a doctor . Don 't call anybody ! Hello ? Lori , go ! Get out ! Lori ? Why are you doing this , Lori ? - Talk ! - l 'm not your wife . I met you six weeks ago . Our marriage is an implanted memory . - l remember our wedding ... - implanted by the Agency . Falling in love , my job , eight years together , all implanted ? - The Agency set up the job . - Bullshit . They implanted a new identity . I was written in as your wife so that I could watch you . Sorry , Quaid . Your whole life is just a dream . If I 'm not me , who the hell am I ? Beats me. I just work here . Doug , there 's something I want you to know . You were the best assignment I ever had . Really . - l 'm honoured . - Shall we ... for old times ' sake ? If you don 't trust me , tie me up . - l didn 't know you were so kinky . - Maybe it 's time you found out . Clever girl ! Would you shoot me after all we 've been through ? Some of it was fun . Nice knowing you . - Don 't touch her . - Nobody here . - Are you okay ? - l guess I blew it . - What does he remember ? - Nothing , so far . I 've got him . - He 's going to the subway . Get him . - Move it ! Pack your stuff and get out of here . - What if they bring him back ? - Not a chance . Subway , go ! - Get him , he 's got a gun ! - Cut him off , that way . Hold it , don 't move ! - The escalator . - You four , go up . You come with me . The platform ! - Which way ? - Right . Botco . Tomorrow 's fuels , tomorrow 's prices . Don 't settle for fake implants . Experience space travel the old way on a holiday you can afford . - l want that fucker dead . - l 'm glad he didn 't pork my wife . - Are you saying she liked it ? - l 'm sure she hated every minute . 6-Beta-9 , we have a live transmission from Mr. Cohaagen . - Richter here , patch it in . - What the fuck is going on ? - l 'm neutralising a traitor . - l don 't want him dead , moron ! - He knows too much . - Lori says he can 't remember . - He might soon have total recall . - l want him for re-implantation . Got that ? I want him back in place with Lori . - Did you hear me ? - What ? I couldn 't hear you . - l 've got Quaid ! - l 'll switch channels . I 've got sunspots . - Call me back . - l 'm losing you . Where is he ? - Second level , Galleria . - He should 've been killed on Mars . How are we doing ? - We 're zooming in . - We got him ! - Don 't hang up . - What do you want ? You 're bugged . They 'll be there soon , unless you do as I say . Don 't bother searching , the bug 's in your skull . - Who are you ? - A wet towel can muffle the signal . - How did you find me ? - l 'd advise you to hurry . This 'll buy you some time . They won 't be able to pinpoint you . Shit ! I lost him . Well , find him ! Hurry up , you look beautiful . Now , go to the window . Go ! Can you see me ? This is the suitcase you gave me . - l gave you ? - Get it and keep moving . - Wait ! Who are you ? - We were buddies in the Agency . You asked me , if you disappeared , to come and find you . Goodbye . - That 's mine . - Your name 's not on it . Someone left it for me . Excuse me , ma 'am , but I need it ! Fuck you , you asshole ! The son of a bitch is here somewhere . That guy , there . Hello , I 'm JohnnyCab . Where can I take you ? - Drive ! - Please repeat the destination . - Just go ! - Please state a street and number . - Shit ! Shit ! - l don 't know that address . Please repeat ... Fasten your seat belt ! - The fare is 1 8 credits . - Sue me , dickhead . We hope you enjoyed the ride . Howdy , stranger. I 'm Hauser . If things have gone wrong , you 've got a wet towel on your head . Whatever your name is , here 's the big surprise : You are not you . You 're me . No shit . - 6-Beta-9 , come in . - Did you find him ? We picked up an explosion at the cement factory . Send two units , we 'll meet you there . I worked for Mars intelligence . I did Cohaagen 's dirty work . But recently , I met a woman . She taught me that I was playing for the wrong team . All I can do now is try to make up for it . There 's enough shit in here to fuck Cohaagen . If you 're hearing this , it means he got me first . Here 's the hard part : - Now it is all up to you . - Great . - What have we got ? - l 've got a weak signal . Split up . First , let 's get rid of the bug . Take this and put it up your nose . Don 't worry , it 's self-guiding . Just shove real hard . When you hear the crunch , you 're there . Pull it out . Be careful , it 's my head , too ! - l have a lock . - Up ! Get to Mars . Go to the Hilton and show the Brubaker l.D. at the desk . Do as I say , and we 'll nail the son of a bitch who fucked you and me . I 'm counting on you , buddy . Don 't let me down . In there . There ! There ! - Get to Mars ... Get to Mars . - Give me that . Shit . Get to Mars ... Get to Mars . Welcome to the Mars Federal Colony . Domes have been installed to protect you from the vacuum . Do not touch exterior windows or airlocks . Since the air is limited , smoking is not permitted in the colony . - Thank you , and enjoy your stay . - Passport . Make way ... Stand back ! - Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you . - Any news of Quaid ? - Not since you lost him . - Watch your mouth , Captain ! - How long will you be staying ? - Two weeks . - Look at that shit . - What the hell 's this ? Martians love Kuato . They think he 's George Washington . - Kill the bastard . - Nobody knows who he is . - Do you have fruit or vegetables ? - Two weeks . - Excuse me ? - Two weeks . Two weeks ... lt 's not just graffiti . The rebels have taken the turbinium refinery . And it gets worse ... Quaid . That 's Quaid . The woman ! Get him ... her . Arrest that woman . Get that woman ! Catch ! Get ready for a surprise ! - Open the goddamn door ! - l can 't . They 're all connected . - Cohaagen raised the price of air . - Again ? - Earth doesn 't care about us . - They just want our turbinium . - Excuse me , what 's that ? - The Pyramid Mine ? I worked there , until they found that alien shit . - That 's just a rumour . - You think so ? Mr. Cohaagen . You wanted to see me , sir ? Richter ... - Do you know why I 'm so happy ? - No , sir . Because I have the greatest job in the solar system . As long as the turbinium keeps flowing , I can do anything . The only thing I ever worry about is that one day , if the rebels win , it all might end . You 're not helping ! First you try to kill Quaid , then let him get away ! - He had help from our side , sir . - l know that . - But I thought ... - Don 't think ! You know too little . You do what you 're told , that 's what you do . Yes , sir . Let 's get down to business . We 've got a tricky situation here . Kuato wants what 's in Quaid 's head . He may do it . They say he 's psychic . I have a plan to keep this from happening . Are you going to play along ? Great ! Otherwise I 'll erase your ass . You need a taxi ? I have magazines , music , whiskey ... You need a cab , man ? Come on ! - Good afternoon . Can I help you ? - l would like a room , please . Welcome back , Mr. Brubaker . Your usual suite ? Definitely . - You left something in our safe . - Could you get it ? Identification ? - l 'll go and code your room key . - Thank you . - Suite 61 0 , east wing . - Could I borrow your pen ? Certainly . Thank you . Hey man , you need a cab ? - Why not this one ? - He ain 't got five kids to feed . - Where 's yours ? - Right over there . Hey asshole , that 's my fare ! - Eat this . - Damn you , Benny ! Welcome to Mars , man . - What was that ? - That 's the rebels , man . Let 's go , or they 'll arrest us . - What do the rebels want ? - The usual . Money , freedom , air . - So , where to ? - " Last Resort " . You 're starting early . - First time on Mars ? - Yes . Well , actually , no . Sort of . The man don 't even know if he 's been here or not . Voila , Venusville . You see anything you like ? End of the line . We walk from here . - Do you want to know the future ? - What about the past ? Come on , it 's around the corner . They got everything here . - Want to feel good ? - Not bad , huh ? Read your palm ? Your mind ? The secrets of your heart ? - l can guess that you 're a Taurus . - How did you guess ? - Are all psychics freaks ? - lt goes with the territory . - What happened to them ? - Cheap domes and radiation . Here 's the " Last Resort " . You really want to go in ? - Why not ? - l know a much better place . - Clean girls , better liquor . - And you get kick-backs . - l have five kids to feed . - Take them to the dentist . Thanks ! I 'll wait here for you . Benny 's the name ! - What do you want ? - Where 's Melina ? She 's busy . But Mary 's free . Not free honey , but available . - Thanks. I 'll wait for Melina . - Earth slime ! The thing is , Mel 's picky . She sticks to her regulars . She 'll like me . Mel ! Hello , Hauser . Still bulging , I see . - What have you been feeding it ? - Blondes . I think it 's still hungry . - You dare to show your face here ? - Look who 's talking ! - Tony , give the big guy a break . - Relax . You 'll live longer . - Honey , take care of Tony . - No problem . If you need any help with this one , give me a holler ! You son of a bitch ! I thought Cohaagen killed you . - l guess he didn 't . - And did you forget about me ? Oh Hauser , thank God you 're alive . Melina ... Melina ? Melina ! I 've got to tell you something . - l don 't remember you . - What are you talking about ? I don 't remember you , or us . I don 't even remember me . - How did you get here ? - Hauser left me a note . - Hauser ? You 're Hauser . - Not anymore . Now I 'm Quaid . - Hauser , you 've lost your mind . - No , Cohaagen stole it . When Hauser switched sides , he turned him into me . - Weird . - And he gave me a wife on Earth ... Wife ? Are you married ? - She wasn 't really my wife . - So she was Hauser 's wife ? - Forget ... - l 'm sick of you and your lies . - Why would I lie to you ? - You 're still working for Cohaagen . Don 't be ridiculous . You never loved me , Hauser . You used me to get inside . Inside what ? - You 'd better leave . - Hauser sent me to do something . - l won 't fall for it . - My knowledge can nail Cohaagen . You 've got to help me remember . People are trying to kill me . Really ? All right , I 'm leaving . Baby , I wish I had three hands . - You 're doing fine with two . - Excuse me . See you later . That didn 't take long . Did you ever fuck a mutant ? - Take me to the hotel . - l know these Siamese twins ... This afternoon at 4 : 30 , I declared martial law in the Mars colony . I will not tolerate more damage of our mineral exports . Kuato 's terrorists must understand their efforts bring only misery ... Mr. Quaid ? I need to talk to you . - lt 's about Mr. Hauser . - Who are you ? Doctor Edgemar , from Rekall . Could you open the door ? I 'm unarmed . Don 't worry , I 'm alone . May I come in ? - What do you want ? - This 'll be hard for you to accept . I 'm afraid you 're not really here . - You could have fooled me . - l 'm quite serious . - You 're not here , and neither am I . - Amazing ! - Where are we ? - You 're in a Rekall implant chair . I 'm monitoring you from the psycho-probe console . So I 'm dreaming ? It 's all part of the vacation you sold me ? No , it 's a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes , but you 're inventing it as you go along . If it 's my delusion , who the hell invited you ? I 've been implanted as an emergency measure . I 'm afraid you 're suffering a schizoid embolism . I 've been sent in to try and talk you down . - What 's Cohaagen paying you ? - Think about it . Your dream started during implantation . Everything after that is taken from your Rekall holiday and " Ego Trip " . - You paid to be a secret agent . - Bullshit. lt 's coincidence . What about the girl ? Brunette , athletic , sleazy and demure , as you wanted . Coincidence , too ? She 's real. I dreamt about her before I went to Rekall . Can you hear yourself ? She 's real because you dreamed her ? Maybe this will convince you . Would you open the door ? - You open it . - No need to be rude. I 'll do it . Sweetheart ? Come in , Mrs. Quaid . - And you 're not here either ? - l 'm here ... At Rekall . - l love you . - Right . So you tried to kill me ? No , I 'd never do anything to hurt you . I want you to come back to me . - Bullshit ! - What 's bullshit , Mr. Quaid ? That you 've become paranoid due to neurochemical trauma , or that you 're an invincible secret agent who has been made to think he 's a lowly construction worker ? Stop punishing yourself . You 're a fine man with a beautiful wife . Your whole life is ahead of you . But you must want to return to reality . Let 's assume I do . Then what ? - Swallow this . - What is it ? It 's a symbol . Of your desire to return to reality . Inside your dream , you 'll fall asleep . Let 's say this is all a dream . If I shoot you , it won 't matter . - Don 't . - lt makes no difference to me . But you 'll think I 'm dead . You will be stuck in permanent psychosis . - Let the doctor help you . - Reality will fall apart . Instead of the saviour of the rebels , you 'll be Cohaagen 's friend . You 'll have fantasies of alien civilisations , but back on Earth , you 'll be lobotomised . So get a grip on yourself and put down that gun ! Good . Now take the pill and put it in your mouth . Swallow it ! Go ahead , sweetheart . Now you 've done it ! That 's for making me come to Mars . You know how much I hate this fucking planet . Cuff him . - l got him . - Use the service elevator . Let 's go . Fuck you ! Doug ... Honey ? You wouldn 't hurt me , would you , sweetheart ? Sweetheart , be reasonable . After all , we 're married . - Consider that a divorce . - That was your wife ? What a bitch ! Get out of the way ! - l thought you didn 't like me . - l do if you 're Cohaagen 's enemy . - Got it . - So you came back to apologise ? Kuato wants to see you . - Now what ? - Jump ! No , don 't do it ! You 'll crack the dome ! Do you want to kill us ? The dome will crack ! Move ! Taxi ! Melina ... - " Last Resort " . - You 're going in circles . - Jesus ! - Come on , you drive ! - Are you in trouble ? - Go , go ! - What are you doing to me ? - Shut up and drive ! I 've got five kids to feed . What are you doing ? Oh , Christ ! Now they 're after me . Get out of the way ! Tony ! Thank you , Tony . - Hi ! You want to have some fun ? - Where are they ? What are you talking about ? I don 't know . Maybe you know ? Kill them all ! Richter ! A call form Cohaagen . - We 've got them pinned down . - Pull out . - But they 're protecting Quaid ! - Perfect . Get out of Sector G , now . - Don 't think , do it ! - Yes , sir . - Pull them out . - Everybody pull out , move ! - Cohaagen 's sealing off the area . - Come on , Benny ! The first settlers died of overwork , while Cohaagen took the profits . His cheap domes turned the kids into freaks . - And we have to buy his air . - Maybe you can change that . I think my grandpa might be here . - What can I do ? - Kuato will help you to remember . - You might remember you love me . - l don 't need Kuato for that . Since when ? - Freeze ! - Come on , Melina . Kuato 's waiting . I didn 't find Grandpa , but ... Oh , shit ! - Who 's he ? - He helped us get away . Don 't worry about me , man . I 'm on your side . You 're a mutant , huh ? All right , let 's go . - Try ramming the door . - Wait here . Follow me . - lt wouldn 't do any good . - Then drill through to Sector M. We can 't . We 're running out of air . We need help . Melina just got here with Quaid . - l hope he was worth it . - So do I . I 'm glad you made it . Cohaagen 's shut off the air to Venusville . You must know something important . If we don 't turn you in , we all die . - So we have no choice . - We can 't turn him in . That 's up to Kuato . Come with me , Quaid . - Sit down . - Where 's Kuato ? On his way . You 've heard about the Pyramid Mine ? Cohaagen found something there that 's got him scared . - What ? Aliens ? - You tell me . - l don 't know . - Yes , you do . Cohaagen 's secret is buried in your brain . - Kuato will dig it out . - You 're Kuato , right ? Wrong . Kuato 's a mutant , so don 't get upset when you see him . - What do you want , Mr. Quaid ? - The same as you . To remember . - But why ? - To be myself again . You are what you do . A man is defined by his action , not his memory . Take my hands . Now open your mind to me . Please ... Open your mind ... Open your mind ... - He said to blow it up . - l say , turn it on and see . We can 't . A chain reaction could affect all our turbinium . A meltdown on a planetary scale . - Didn 't the aliens think of that ? - Who knows ? They weren 't human . - Maybe it 's a trap . - We don 't even know if it works . What is it , a million ? Half a million ? Half a million years old . Let 's make sure no one ... Wake up ! Come on , wake up ! They found us . Shit , let 's go . They found us ! Everybody out ! Get moving ! Get out ! Everybody out ! Get to the air lock ! Benny , come on . - Benny ? - l 'm coming ! Put these space suits on . We 're going outside . Benny , hurry . Congratulations , Quaid . You led us right to him . How can you do this ? You 're a mutant . - l 've got four kids to feed . - Wasn 't it five ? Shit , man ! You got me . I ain 't even married . Now put your fucking hands up . Quaid ... Forget it , man . His fortune telling days are over . Start the reactor . Free Mars ... Mr. Cohaagen wants to talk to you . So this is the great man ? No wonder he kept out of sight . - Well , my boy ... you 're a hero . - Fuck you . Kuato 's dead , and the resistance is completely wiped out , thanks to you . - He 's lying . - You two-faced bastard ! You can 't blame him , angel . He 's innocent . You see , none of my people could get close to Kuato . The mutants always knew . So Hauser and I invented you . A perfect mole . Lies ! Hauser turned against you . That 's what we wanted you to think . Hauser volunteered to become you . - So we could fool the psychics . - That 's a lie . This idiot tried to kill me . Why kill someone you want to plant ? - He didn 't know . You set him off . - So why am I still alive ? We gave you lots of help . Benny , here . The suitcase , the mask , the money , Hauser 's message ... - lt was all set up by us . - Sorry . Too perfect . Perfect , my ass ! You pop your memory cap too early , - - Richter goes hogwire screwing up everything. I 'm amazed it worked . Cohaagen , I have to hand it to you . It 's the best mindfuck yet . Well , don 't take my word for it . - Here 's someone you trust . - Who is it now ? My mother ? Hi , Quaid ! If you 're listening to this , then Kuato 's dead , and you have led us to him . Sorry for the shit I put you through , but what are friends for ? I would wish you a long life , but I 'm afraid that won 't happen . It 's my body , and I want it back . Sorry to be an Indian giver , but I was here first . So , adios amigo ! And thanks for not getting yourself killed . Maybe we 'll meet in our dreams . You never know . You bastards ! Let go of me ! - Ready ? - Ready to go , sir . Relax , Quaid . You 'll like being Hauser . - He 's an asshole . - No . He 's one of my best friends . Besides , he 's got a big house , a Mercedes ... You like Melina ? You can fuck her every night . She 'll be Hauser 's babe . - l 'll bust his balls . - No , princess . We 're having you fixed . You 'll be respectful , compliant and appreciative . As a woman should be . Mr. Cohaagen ? Telephone . The oxygen level is bottoming out in Sector G. What shall I do ? - Do nothing . - But they won 't last an hour , sir . - Fuck them. lt 'll teach the others . - You won , now give them air ! In five minutes , you won 't care about them . Fire it up , Doc ! - Will he remember any of this ? - No . Oh , really ? I 'm having a party tonight . Come by with Melina . Remind him , Doc . Keep still . Fighting just makes it hurt . Keep still , or you 'll end up psychotic . Melina , hold on ! Are you all right ? Are you still you ? I 'm not sure , dear . What do you think ? Let 's get the hell out of here . You have to make a decision , sir . - Kill him . - lt 's about goddamn time . - Where are you going ? - To the reactor . - What reactor ? - ln the mines . Come on ! People are dying ! We must get air . The reactor makes air . That 's Cohaagen 's secret . - Where did it come from ? - Aliens built it . - Are you sure about this ? - lt 's just up ahead . What the hell .. ? Quaid ! You remember me ? Benny ! Benny 's the name . That 's good ! I 'll drill you , sucker ! I 'll grind you up ! I 'm coming . I 'm coming for you , baby ! What the fuck ? Martian junk ! I 'll squash you , Quaid ! Benny ! Where the fuck are you ? Screw you ! - Quaid , get over here . - What is it ? - There 's an opening . - l knew it . This whole reactor is made of turbinium . Cohaagen knows it makes air . The bastard won 't turn it on . If Mars had an atmosphere , he 'd lose control . You see down there ? It 's a glacier . The whole core of Mars is ice . The reactor melts it , and it releases the oxygen . - Come on . - Enough for everyone to breathe ? Enough for the whole planet ... if we turn it on in time . Come on ! Hold on . Now ! Son of a bitch ! Let 's go ! He 's got a hologram ! You think this is the real Quaid ? It is ! You 're coming with me . See you at the party , Richter ! - Don 't touch that ! Get away ! - What are you afraid of ? - Turn it on . - lmpossible . It will affect all the turbinium . Mars will go into global meltdown . - The aliens never turned it on . - You think I believe you ? Who cares ? In 30 seconds , you 'll be dead . I 'll blow this place up and be home for breakfast . I didn 't want it to end this way . I wanted Hauser back . - But you had to be Quaid ! - l am Quaid . You 're nothing ! You 're nobody ! You 're a stupid dream . Well , all dreams come to an end . Melina , hold on ! Don 't do it , we 'll all die ! Everybody will die ! I can 't believe it , it 's like a dream . - What 's wrong ? - l just had a terrible thought . What if this is a dream ? Well then , kiss me quick , before you wake up .

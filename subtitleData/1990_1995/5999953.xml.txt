 Loretta , some of your friends stopped by . They need two OJ 's and a ginger ale . Got it . Clark , did you bring it ? Oh yeah , I got it right here . Gosh . It 's really special , you know ? Um , look he signed it right there . " To Loretta , for a super gal . From Superboy . " Um , gosh , thanks , thanks . I mean , I told him what a big fan you are , and it was really no big- - Oh , Clark . No , I got it , it 's okay . You know , Clark , I 've been asking you for two weeks to set up a meeting with me and Superboy , talk about some of my ideas , and , uh , what do I get , a big fat goose egg ? You talkin ' about those stupid masks ? - Stupid masks ? - Yeah . We 're talkin ' about most possibly the best selling item this coming up Halloween , and you say " stupid masks " ? Stupid ? Yeah , read my lips , stupid , stupid , stupid . Um , uh , I 'm kind of busy tonight . We 're down a bartender , so I gotta get back . Thanks a-a lot , Clark . It 's no big deal . " Hey , thanks a lot , Clark . " She wants you . She needs you , man . Andy , stop it . Come on , guys . Take her , you viking ! " The body vessel must be facing the flame of life . " [ Chanting in foreign language ] Oh great spirit of Gazook , I call you now . Come forth and show me so I may bow . Give me powers , don 't let them lag . Please come alive in this doll of rag . Come forth , o great spirit of Gazook . Come forth and guide me . Nothing . Should have known . Did someone call me , huh ? Did someone summon the Great Gazook from the dark past ? Yes , I did . Well , chickie , you got me . I live in the body of this doll . I am the Great Gazook . I know what you want , Loretta . Yes . You want the love of a man , don 't you ? Yes . But not just any man will do , huh , bubble ? You want the love of the man they call ... Superboy . This is the one you love . Yes , he 's the one . You must be transformed . You must be beautiful , a knockout . Look at you , an ancient genie , a peri , beautiful golden hair . I 'll call you the Yellow Peri now . Together you and I will perform the most powerful magic , in the world , Yellow Peri , and we shall cast a love spell on this Superboy ! Huh , what do you think , do I look like the Boy of Steel ? Ah , just got these back from the fabricators today . I knew they would be great . I think definitely the future for these is in cereal . You know , we could flatten ' em out and stick ' em in the boxes , whatever . I was thinking maybe you could talk to superboy , you know . Andy , I 'll mention to Superboy the next time I see him , but ... Don 't hold your breath . Clark , you know how many times you told me not to hold my breath ? Twenty-seven . Are you sure this is gonna work ? Do your magic , Yellow Peri , and Superboy will come , and he will fall in love with you when he sets his eyes on you . Hey , guys . Hi , Lana . Hey , baby . Superboy , could I have your autograph ? Yeah , sure . Excuse me . I 've been watching you . I think you 're beautiful . I didn 't think you noticed . How could I not notice a woman as beautiful as you ? Oh , Superboy . Ha , look at him , signing autographs . He saw you , he didn 't even notice you . Superboy ! Our love spell should have worked . It 's her , it 's her ! Don 't you know , chickie ? You don 't know how glad I am to see you . I 'm just glad I could be of help . Well , you always show up when you 're needed . Well , so far . Only the true love of another can break the spell . What can I do , Gazook ? Do ? You 're a genie , get rid of her . It 's the only way . How ? Simple . Kill her ! Come on , Clark , lift it ! Lift it , you can do it , man , you 're an animal , you 're a maniac , just lift it just once ! Come on ! Andy , I think it 's still too heavy . Clark , I 've taken off all the weights . Hey , guys . How 's it going , Clark ? Uh , you wanna work out ? Not with you . She 's just kidding . I 'll be right there . I 'm gonna go slip into something more comfortable . Look , Andy , I did it , come see ! Look , look ! Andy . Don 't I know you ? I have to go . Hey , Yellow Peri ! Gazook ? Help me . It 's about time you came back . I 've had dirty , wet towels thrown on me . She finally came out . Perfect , perfect . Don 't back out , Yellow Peri . Don 't be weak . I know . We must do it . That is right , no one understands you like I do . I know what you feel . Yes . And with my magic I know just what to do . Ah , go forth , my child , make me proud . Don 't even think about it . Ah , come on , why not ? We can divide it , 50 / 50 . I 'll stay on my side . Andy . Powers that be , I want some trouble . Put the pretty one in a sealed tight bubble . What is this ? Get me out of here ! Andy ! Somebody ... I can 't breathe . Lana , hold on ! We must get out of here . You must plan for tonight . Superboy will be grieving when he finds out his love has died . Your new boyfriend will need your shoulder to cry on . Somebody ... Somebody call somebody . Lana , hold on ! I can 't breathe . Somebody--somebody call somebody . Lana , hold on ! Lana ! Lana , hold on . Lana , hold on . Somebody , somebody call somebody . Lana , hold on . Andy , step aside . Is she gonna be okay ? What happened ? That 's what I 'd like to find out . You look particularly lovely tonight , my toots . Do I ? You really think I look good ? Good ? You look scrumptious . I do look good , don 't I ? I really am pretty . Yes , my dear . And everyone will know , and Superboy will need your shoulder to cry on now that his friend Lana Lang bought the big farm . Whooee , a one-eyed sea monster . In a bizarre incident at Schuster University this afternoon , Superboy reportedly saved- - This is horrible ! I can 't stand this ! - -We have a news team heading to the location . We 'll have a live report later in this newscast . How does he do it ? Superboy , he 's always there ! And now that girl is still in his heart . If you can 't have Superboy , nobody can have him ! Do you understand , Yellow Peri ? Nobody ! You 're right , Gazook , and nobody will have him . Not after I do what I have planned . Yes , let 's do it , let 's do it . It 'll be fun , it 'll be fun ! I am the Yellow Peri , no man rejects me , not even Superboy . Superboy must pay , pay for passing up your charm , your beauty . The man you love causes you disgrace , do it all and take away his face ! Yes , do it , do it . Cut , cut , cut , cut , cut ! [ Chanting in foreign language ] You 'll have no face , this is true . Oh , my God . All right , great , so I 'll definitely give you a call about that braille and poetry seminar . Yeah , okay , great . What a body ! Hey , Clark . I knew you liked that mask . Great . Uh , yeah . Um , I thought that since I told Superboy about it that I should try one on myself and see what I thought . Huh , phenomenal . Yeah , you know there 's a finder 's fee for you in this . Ha . Pretty scary what happened to Lana today , huh ? Oh , you know what else ? I think I saw Loretta at the gym . At least , it sounded like her . Loretta ? Yeah , except for she looked ... Good . She looked pretty , you know ? And she was wearing this like strange Arabian workout uniform . You know what else was strange ? She was in a real hurry . She left during the commotion . Oh , I just remembered , I was supposed to meet with Superboy tonight . I was wondering , Andy , would you mind if I wore one of your masks tonight and kind of show him ? Oh , wow , that would be great . Do I mind , no , that would be phenomenal . You know , Clark , I 'm really glad that you 're so enthused about this . I 'll , uh , give you a call and let you know how it goes . All right , great , man , cool . Great kid . Loretta . So it was you at the gym today . I am the Yellow Peri . Loretta is gone . Why are you doing these things ? And why did you do this to me ? I loved you , but you refuse to love the great Yellow Peri . So you took my face away ? Oh , I will give you your face back . But now you must kiss me . You must want me . We can always be together . Now I 'm pretty , aren 't I ? Now you want me , don 't you ? Loretta , let me help you . No ! You 're not Loretta , you 're Yellow Peri now . Don 't listen to him , he tells lies . It talks . What is that thing ? It 's not a thing , that 's Gazook . He lives in my doll . He 's my only true friend . You have other friends . Friends ? You hear this , Yellow Peri ? Hear how he mocks us ? Yes , yes , he does . Can 't you see what he 's done to you ? Can 't you see how he 's changing you ? He 's not your friend as I am . It 's not a friend you need , it 's a lover , kill him , kill her boy . If I cannot have you , Superboy , no one else ever will . I will destroy you as only my powerful magic can . No . I 've given you every chance , you 've had your turn . Now it 's time for you to burn . Burn , nice boy , burn , burn , go to ashes ! Ah , look at the boy burning ! I 'll get you . Your powers don 't cut it with me , Superboy . I 'm magic . Only magic can hurt me like it 's hurting you . If I use your magic heat on you . Ow , ow , I feel the heat . Ah , ah ! It 's your magic , Gazook . No , Gazook , don 't leave me ! Burning , ah ! Oo , ah ! That 's what I was counting on . No one will ever love me . Loretta , there are better ways to find love that have nothing to do with magic . Maybe you didn 't plan on hurting anyone , but you 're still gonna have to answer- - come back to life , doll of rag , don 't let me alone to die an old hag . Loretta ... How can I go , Boy of Steel ? Without Gazook nothing else seems real . Loretta , I know a place where there are people that can help you . Some day the right man will sweep me off my feet . Some day true love will make my life complete . Some day , Loretta , some day . Captioned by Grant Brown

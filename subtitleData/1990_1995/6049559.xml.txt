 He 's lost a lot of blood . We 're losing him . Can 't you do anything ? I can 't even close the wound . What could 've cut him like that ? I don 't know . But I know someone who might . - But he 's ... - He 's the only Well ... Here it is . So , how do you like it ? No , no , no , no , no . We have to stay here . This is our home , sweetie . Home . - Can you say that ? - Darla , he 's not a moron . A month from now , he 'll be speaking which isn 't saying much . You see , we have to live here . This is the best place that we could afford . - You could say that again . - Shut up . You see , son . Really nice homes cost lots of money . And the bad people took all of ours . - What bad ... - Shh ! The bad people took all of our money , and they hid it in places called banks . Banks ? Banks . And they keep it there in these great big vaults . So ? We have to live like this . Bank . You 're reading a bit slowly , aren 't you ? It 's poetry , Lex . Sounds better in my mind when I go slow . Huh . I was afraid it was going to be Crime and Punishment . Remember when I made you read that ? [ laughs ] How could I forget ? I was only 12 years old . It was the worst torture I wasn 't punishing you , Lex . I was trying to help . You showed great promise . I didn 't want you to go in the wrong direction . You mean , embark on a life of crime ? That 's a bit far fetched , don 't you think ? We 'll never know now , will we ? Thanks to you . I owe you so much , and yet it seems all I I need your help . I can 't , Lex . You know that . No , no . It 's got to be you . Lex , when you reach a certain age , and let the younger people take over . They 'll never learn to run it if I wouldn 't have come here if you weren 't the only one in the world who can save this patient . The only one , Lex ? How can that be ? The patient is you . My car 's right outside . Your car ? I 'm not that old . [ whooshing ] No internal injuries . [ Lex ] What could cause a wound like this ? [ Clark ] There are traces of a Kryptonian crystal , he wouldn 't have been invulnerable to it . Have you ever seen a crystal like that before ? Oh yes , I have . It was a long time ago ... On the rocket that brought me here . I 've got some O negative here . - Looks like we 'll have to take the chance ... I 'll give him some of my own . [ Lex ] But how will we get the needle in him ? [ Clark ] That won 't be a problem . Luther ! - [ choking ] - Take it easy . Easy ... It 's all right . - He tried to kill me ! - That was a different Luther . - This one saved your life . - No , he 's tricking you ! You listen to me , you 're alive because of him . Now , get some rest , you need it . Wait ! You hit me . Yes . And I 'll do it again if you don 't get some rest . But it hurt . How did you do that ? In the morning ... In the morning . [ sighs ] [ bell rings ] [ people shouting ] Lana , you were right . Look ! [ reporter ] About just a moment ago I was informed here on the scene , that the bullets had And bank officials estimate the loss of I 'm standing out here in front of the bank It was the boy you told us about . You were right all along . And the worst part is there 's no way I know someone who can . You do ? Well , where is he ? I wish I knew . I can 't believe this is Capitol City . Well , it just shows what can happen when I became Superboy right after the war . You 'd have thought with all that fighting and killing , they 'd have had enough of it , but it didn 't look that way . - Then you stepped in ? - Mm . I did what I could . And then the people pitched in . There you are . Good as new . If you 're me , why are you For the same reason that boy you found on the The time warp . A time warp ? You know those rockets that brought us here ? Well , it seems they went through a time warp I landed during the Depression . That boy landed a few years ago . You and some others landed when you did . Do you know where the rockets came from ? I do . - Then tell me . - It 's not your time yet . When will it be my time . You 'll know . And from that time on , you won 't be called Lex ? Thank you , darling . [ sighs ] He just looks so happy . Mm . It 's a shame we 'll have to kill him . [ laughs ] I thought you were serious You realize he could tear us apart with one hand ? What happens when he turns on us ? Lex , he wouldn 't do that . He loves us . I turned on my parents . Of course , I didn 't love them , but ... What about the money ? Darla , I 'll be a hero . The man who saved Capitol City . We 'll be broke . Why do you always think so small ? Publicity is power . My power . Under my control . I can 't control him forever . Your power ? No . No , that 's not it . - You 're jealous . - [ scoffs ] Of what ? He 's going to be the biggest thing He may even be running the country someday , and what are you ever going to amount to ? Anything I want to . As long as he 's not around to stop me . [ Darla laughs ] Is this going to be my future ? It can be . I don 't know if I can do all this . Well , of course you can . I did it . We 're the same person . But all the sacrifices you must 've made . Are you happy ? Happy ? Look around . This is a utopia . All those ideals of yours ... ours . Everyone believes them now . No war , pollution , crime . We 're wiping out diseases left and right . Every single person on this planet has We 've even gone into other worlds So , why shouldn 't someone who 's accomplished all that I can tell you 're bored . Oh , I forgot for a minute who I was talking to . Can 't lie to myself , can I ? You don 't have any challenges left . But that 's what retirement 's all about . - Letting go of challenges . - How can you stand it ? Oh , it 's a part of life . And it wouldn 't be so bad , except for ... one thing . - What 's that ? - Being alone . You see , I never had time to have a family . I was always too busy out helping other people Now there 's no one for me . - Nobody ? - No one . Don 't you let that happen to you when you Well , I don 't know if I 'm going back . - At least , not right away ... - You don 't have to Lex Luther 's got the boy . That 's not your concern . Go back to your own world . The boy needs my help . I can 't let you do it . Oh , so I see you 're feeling better . [ Superboy ] Yeah , terrific . Well , the portal 's all ready to take you home . You know he 's one of us . He could 've been you or me . We have to give him a chance . So , what can you do to me ? [ police chatter ] What are you , crazy ? Get out of here . Now stay here . [ man ] It 's a very , very tense situation here . They boy is inside the museum right now . The SWAT team has just gone in and they 've taken up in hopes to remedy the situation ... - [ gun shots ] - [ people gasping ] [ gun shots ] No , please . No , no ! [ screams ] Hey , hey , hey ... put me down ! [ yelling ] Are we rolling ? All right . Apparently , the SWAT team was ineffective . As best as I can tell , the boy is still inside . Let 's just hope that no one 's been hurt . This is again , a very , very tense situation here ... Clark ? You 're OK . Lana , I 'm fine . But I really have to go ... Wait . What happened to you ? Where did you go ? Look , I can 't talk right now . I have to get going . To go change into the red and blue costume What ? Come with me . Back off ! Back off ... What are you ? Deaf ? I said , back off ! [ stuttering ] Look , I think I can help . We 've got all the help we need here . Get me your commanding officer . I know who you are . I saw you change . I 've got to go . I guess you have a lot of work to do . A lot of it . I always wondered what this would be like . Wait ! The " S " ... It 's the Superboy . Son ? Father ! Your mother and I have been worried about you . So , we got you a little present . - Present ? - Uh-huh . Here it is . Thank you . [ gasping ] You again , huh ?

You have a lot of work ahead of you . So do you . [ Lana ] Wait ! You can 't go . I have so many questions to ask you . I have questions , too . That 's why I have to go back to where I came from . But I want to know who you are , It 's better this way .

 Coffee . Lights out . Sorry . Did I startle you ? No , it 's all right . - Can I help you ? - Yes . No-one can make it work . A friend said that you were a miracle man . - Do you know how much this is worth ? - I 'd never sell it . It belonged to my late father . I thought you 'd be much older . You don 't look like a watchmaker . - What do watchmakers look like ? - I don 't know . Old ... Beard ... From Belgium or France , you know . The guy that owns the store looks like that . He 's the miracle-worker . I 'm just a good impostor . Call me when it 's ready . Dr Anna Nolmar ? You 're a doctor ? I 'm a cognitive therapist . A psychoanalyst . You don 't look like an analyst . What do analysts look like ? Old ... Beard ... From Belgium . I 've got to go . I 'm late for a session . Please make it work again . - Hi , Eddy . - Hi , Bernie . How you doing ? OK , Stud Muffin , let 's have it . - Cheeseburger , please . - OK . - A dinner salad with thousand island dressing . - Good choice . - And a glass of milk . - OK . Buns ? - Excuse me ? - Buns or toast , with the salad ? There 's a baby ! - Help me ! Help ! - Will somebody help her ? Eddy ! Don 't go over there ! Eddy , get back ! Jesus ! Let me out of here ! Lady ! Where are you ? Lady , where are you ? Dean Jordan , about to be sworn in as the new US Attorney General is in Los Angeles this weekend . The former special prosecutor achieved national prominence while exposing vast corruption in the defence procurement process . On Sunday , Jordan will address the National Bar Association 's conference . Known as a critic to coven operations ... - ... Jordan will outline his plan to investigate ... - Fantasy Girl . Credit card , please . Credit card number 4833482373 . Your name is Barbara , you 're a five foot nine brunette bank teller . - Your dream girl ? - Yeah . From Portland . With large breasts and long legs . And I 'm Bobby . Well , Bobby , is there something special you 'd like to talk about ? Tell me about the one night we spent together last year . When you locked me in the bank vault ? - Are you wet ? - Just thinking about it . Good . It was closing time when you came to my window . I hadn 't seen a strong , sexy man all day ... .. before rescue teams arrived . He braved intense flames and toxic smoke to rescue a woman and her infant trapped in a raging inferno . He ran into this building with flames coming out and people ran over and this guy , he 's just a regular guy , a watchmaker . I couldn 't believe it . At a time when our heroes seem confined to the sports arena ... - Yes , what is it ? - Hello , sir . Sorry to disturb you . We have ... a situation here . A very weird situation . - Do you remember Eddy Kay ? - Bluebird Eddy Kay ? - The same . - What about Eddy Kay ? Well , I think I just saw him on TV . When ? Where ? Here in LA . - Eddy is ... - He 's supposed to be dead . He 's alive ? What are you gonna do ? I think we must find out and , if he is we must deal with him quietly . Hi , guys . How ya doing ? Don 't be such a stuffy old father . - You make it sound like ... - A dirty word . .. some sense into our kids . ... with their hips instead of their heads . - Morning , Mrs MacDonald . - Hi , Eddy . - You look nice today . - Thank you very much . - Good morning , Al . - Morning . Colonel , that is Eddy Kay . I 'll be damned . Follow him . Bring everybody in . I don 't want to take any chances with this . Take a crack at him tonight . Make it look like a robbery . Somethings going on . Help ! Help ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Somebody call the police ! - Lose the sandwich . - Hey , lose the attitude , OK ? It 's not some big-time homicide case . It 's a nothing piece-of-shit burglary detail . - Social security number . - 527195251 . - Your telephone number ? - I don 't have a telephone . Mr Kay ? I 'm Detective Sanchez . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine , but ... Well , what seems to be the problem ? I 'm not trying to tell anybody how to do their job . But these guys are insisting on writing this up as a robbery . And this guy was trying to kill me . There 's been several burglaries in the neighbourhood in the last three months . - They probably think it 's the same man . - This wasn 't a burglary . This guy was not a burglar , you know ? He didn 't take anything . There 's nothing missing . I have nothing to take . I opened my eyes and his guy was coming at me with a knife . Mr Kay , who has a good reason to see you dead ? Someone you got mad recently , someone who had a grudge against you . Someone you owed money to . I don 't owe anybody money . I 'm ... I 'm a nice guy . Mr Kay , what did the man look like ? I don 't know , man . He was ... He looked like a psycho . He looked like a killer . He was trying to kill me . Then how come he didn 't ? I don 't know . Good morning , Eddy . Honey , could you help me with this pot ? I 've got the earth all ready for it . Just set it right in here , OK ? - Thank you . That 's just great . - There you go . Thank you , that 's great . How are you feeling ? Eddy , what 's the matter ? Are you all right ? - Eddy ? - Yes . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Is there anything I can do ? No , I 'm all right . Sorry . Sure , Eddy . Eddy ! Move , asshole ! No . This has to look like an accident . I 'll be damned . The living dead . - The package is ready . Let 's go . - I 'll send the messenger . The delivery will be on time . Block four . Repeat , block four . Alpha . Alpha . Repeat , alpha . Lock three , repeat lock three . Block two . Repeat , block two . - Block one . - Bravo . Bravo . Repeat , bravo . Somebody call an ambulance . - Did we kill him ? - I don 't know . - I think he 's dead ! - Get the license number . That guy hit him ! I didn 't see anything . He 's moving . - Call an ambulance , hurry ! - Get help ! No go . Repeat , no go . Good evening , Eddy . Do it ! This has gotta stop . Yes ? Dr Nolmar ? Hi , this is Eddy Kay . Mr Kay . Is my watch ready ? The watch isn 't fixed yet . That 's why I was calling . I was hoping I could drop by the office , your office and , give you a replacement watch that you could use . - I wouldn 't want to put you to any trouble . - It 'd be no trouble at all . I 'd like to do it . If you really want to , you could come by tonight after my last session . - Do you have the address ? - Yes . - A bit after eight . - All right , see you then . - Hello . - Hi . You really didn 't have to , you know . That 's OK . I didn 't want you walking around with some electronic junk . Thank you for bringing this over . I appreciate good service . Can I ask you a question ? I 've been having these ... I don 't even know what to call them . Like ... nightmares , during the day . They 're real . Like memories , but not memories of anything that really happened to me . Do you know anything about that ? Is that something that ... ? Well , I have to leave soon . Maybe you 'd like to schedule a session . No , I don 't think so . I 'm ... not ... It was ... It was just a question . Come in . Come in . I see ... images . And some of them ... are really violent . And bloody . It 's really disgusting . And ... Others of ... women . It 's like pornography . And I 'm not ... a violent person . I don 't know where I ... Maybe your repressed memory is trying to come out . No . I 've got a really good memory . I 've always prided myself on that . I can remember the smallest details of my childhood , my friends , their names . I used to have a friend named Kevin ... Richards . We used to call him Kevie . We used to get into trouble together . We 'd play sports . I had a really normal childhood . Do you have any history of alcohol or drug abuse ? Yeah . I ... I started drinking and I got into drugs . I took a lot of drugs . How did you stop ? I woke up in a garbage dump one morning . And I was sick . And my clothes had been really badly burned and my body had been burned and I don 't know howl got there . I knew then that I had to make a change . I kind of drifted and ended up on the West Coast . And I felt ... I was feeling good . I 'd just started feeling really good about myself . When did you last get a check-up ? - A what ? - A medical examination . I 've never been sick . Well , I think you should get a thorough check-up and a brain scan . A PET . You think there might be something physically wrong ? No , but sometimes memory neurons are destroyed by alcohol or drug abuse or even cerebral tumours . My uncle is a neuropsychiatrist so I can easily make you an appointment . - Thank you very much for your time . - That 's OK . Gee , I forgot to pay you . Well , let 's barter . You get this session for fixing my watch . Deal ? Deal . - Is that your father ? - Yes , we shared the office . - But ... - He died a year ago . I can 't bring myself to remove his name . Good night , Mr Kay . Thank you . I feel better . Dr Nolmar ? Hi , Eddy . I don 't know you . Come on , Eddy . You know me well . - Why don 't we go somewhere and talk ? - About what ? Whatever . The past . Or the Duke . I don 't know any duke . We are in an inescapable network of mutuality . Get back ! Cut him off ! Cover me ! Stop . Help ! Let me in , please ! - Please ! - What is going on ? Go ! Drive ! Go , go ! God , they were trying to kill me ! - Didn 't you see them ? - Who ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - N-No ! Don 't stop ! Didn 't you see them ? Eddy , please calm down . There 's nobody following us . Didn 't you see ' em ? - No . - In the parking structure , you didn 't see ' em ? Why don 't you let me take you to the police ? I 've been to the police . They don 't believe me . What do you want to do ? I don 't know . Listen , Eddy , you 're so confused and upset at the moment . I ... I think we should go to hospital and run those tests . Now . The hospital . Why ? Anna , you are such a good doctor but you have no private life . - You drag me here in the middle of the night ... - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . ... and for nothing ! - Am I all right ? - You 're fine . Though there are some irregularities on your hippocampus . - My what ? - Your hippocampus . The bundle of neurons straddling the lower brain lobes . What 's the matter with my hipp ... hipp ... whatever ? It 's difficult to explain , but what the tests seem to show ... - Anna . Yes ? You should be out with a sane young man on a romantic evening . Uncle , you talk like my father ... Excuse me ... but this hurts . - Where are you from ? - I didn 't know you spoke Hungarian . Hungarian ? I don 't . But you just did . Yes , you did speak Hungarian . - Hi . - Hi . Do you have eggs for sale ? I don 't have eggs , only sausages . Do you want some ? Eddy . - Eddy , what happened ? - God ! What ? - Yes ? - Bad news , sir . - He 's in the hospital . - Hospital ? Which one 's got him ? - Ha . Psychiatric ward . - Psychiatric ? Is he talking ? I don 't know how much he remembers . Certainly he doesn 't remember anything before the de-programming . And , if he 'd wanted to , he could have caused us trouble years ago . - So he 's not posing an immediate threat ? - Yes . But to be on the safe side , perhaps we should call Sunday off . We can 't do that . There 's too much at stake . Forget about doing this quietly . There isn 't time . Go in big , take Kay out and finish the job . Sir , I don 't think that 'd be prudent ... If physically nothing 's wrong with me , then why do I feel so different ? My body just feels so different . It 's like I know how to do things that I don 't know how to do . Somebody else is living in my body . Have you ever undergone treatment in a mental institution ? No . I 've never been in a hospital , never even been sick . That 's why this thing is ... - Are you sure ? - Yes , I 'm sure . Come ... Come ... Come to me , Eddy . Come to me . Eddy . What do you see ? Tell me . Building . La ... Lang Mental Institute . Lang ... Lang . I 've never heard of it . I 'll check tomorrow . They should have your records . I 've never been there . I 've never been there . - Listen , you should try and sleep . - No , no . Can 't you stay ? - A little while ? - You really should sleep . Please , please . - Let me give you a sedative . - I don 't want a sedative . Please , I don 't want to be alone . - Lieutenant Curtis in ? - I don 't think so . The only police personnel is Officer Gilbert on night duty . - I could call and check . - It 's OK . He 's supposed to meet us . We 'll wait . How you doing , sir ? D5 . Psychiatric . It 's OK . What was that ? Hey , what the ] ? Don 't shoot ! - What is it ? - Men with guns . Come on ! Come on ! Damn , we outta time . Come on , let 's go . Come on ! Come on ! Stop . I want to get out . Please . How 'd they know where I was ? Only you knew I was at the hospital . And in the garage . You 're one of them . Why accuse me ? I 've only tried to help you . By giving me a sedative ? If I 'd taken that , I 'd be dead . You 're mad . Whatever your game is , I don 't want to be involved . You are involved ! Just do what I say . Exactly what I say . Do you understand me ? Stay here . Sta ) ' - - Aubrey , Homicide . - Forensics ? Yeah , hang on a minute . Hey , Sanchez . - Line one , it 's for you . - I 'll take it over here . - Sanchez . - Eddy Kay . Remember me ? Do you know what happened ? Did you hear what happened ? They 're trying to kill me . - Is Dr Nolmar with you ? - Yes . If anything happens to me , she gets hurt . Eddy , or whatever your name is , you are in trouble . - Get here as soon as you can . - What ? You 're not Eddy Kay . Cut the bullshit . - What ? - Listen to me . Now , Eddy Kay , social security number 527195251 born Canton , Ohio , died - do you hear me ? - died in Vietnam in 1972 . - I 'm not Eddy Kay . - What did he say ? Get off me ! Eddy , get off me ! Let me go . Let me go ! Get in ! If you try anything in the hotel , anything , I 'll kill you , understand ? Eddy , please . You need medicine . Let me fetch you some medicine , Eddy . You could have a stroke . Just a few grains of Phenelzine or nialamide will calm you down . - You don 't know who you are , Eddy . - I know who I am ! Somebody is trying to make me think I don 't ! - Hello ? - Hello . Mrs Richards ? Mrs Richards of 852 Elm Street ? - Yes . - It 's good to hear your voice . And yours . Who is this ? - Mrs Richards , this is Eddy Kay . - Who ? Your neighbour , Kevin 's friend , Eddy Kay . Is this some kind of a prank ? Eddy 's dead . He was killed in Vietnam . If this is a prank , it 's not funny . - It 's not a prank . - Then who is this ? I ... I didn 't die . I ... I ... I didn 't die , I ... Mrs Richards , please . Mrs Richards , please . Please , Mrs Richards . What have you done ? It 's a sacrilege . Let him rest in peace . Are you listening to me ? Go to hell . I 'm sorry . I 'm in big trouble . I don 't even know what I 've done . Help me . - May I help you , sir ? - Phillips . They still have money in their houses . - Phillips ? - Yes . - Taylor . - Hi . - I didn 't expect to see you . - You 've received your instructions ? My instructions , yes . Verbally . Nobody wanted to put anything down on paper . I 'm supposed to give you full computer trace access and taps on police lines on the basis of a verbal . Colonel , let me tell you something . I don 't want to have anything to do with it . It 's guys like me that get shafted , not you . Not the guys giving orders . I 'd just as soon be fired now as wind up in Lewiston on contempt . Mr Phillips , I appreciate your predicament . But at the risk of sounding cliched let me tell you , this isn 't about getting fired . This is about life expectancy . Are you threatening me , Colonel ? I see you have an isolator . Shall we ? And I 'll need some coffee . Have you ever heard about the original Bluebird program ? I 've seen the name in the files . It 's restricted access . We 're talking 1970s , right ? Yeah . Well . You see , the agency was having problems with in-house operations . Morale , discipline were extremely low . We needed a new kind of operative . More reliable , more immediate , less ... questioning . Less ... moral . We needed fucking Samurai warriors . People to get the job done . So we started doing behaviour modification experiments using young subjects , 18 , 19 . 13 of the original subjects died in training . Seven became exceptional operatives . Six are still active . And the seventh ? Eddy Kay - Probably the best subject , I 'm certain . Highest scores ever . Technology , languages , hand-to-hand , everything . So ? He quit on you ? He 's writing a book ? What ? Phillips . Eddy Kay was involved in an elimination . We thought he 'd been killed during the elimination . Not so . And now he is threatening a major operation and I got 48 hours to bring him in . We are not talking about a little scandal here . We are talking about political systems . Which is why it has to be verbal . And why you have to cooperate . Come in , six . Your position ? - Hi , honey ! - Come in , three . This is three . Negative . Eddy ? What are you going to do ? What do you do when you don 't know what to do ? You have to talk to yourself . You have to act against your inclination to act instinctively irrationally violently and hang onto a belief system . You went to school for six or seven years and dish out that crap ? Aren 't you hungry ? You know , you can think better on a full stomach . Maybe we could find a coffee shop . All right . I 'll get us something to eat . Here 's some money , and take the credit card . - Take off your sweater and stockings . - What ? - Take off your sweater and stockings . - Why ? Don 't move . No matter what you do , don 't move . Slip up just a little bit , it 'll cut you to ribbons . Where did you learn this little trick ? In watchmaker 's school ? And I was feeling sorry for you ! One , your position . No contact . I don 't hold nothing back . Are you coming up ? Thank you . - We 've got her cards . It 's a matter of time . - Great . What about LAPD photo system ? - We 're in . You want coffee ? - Yeah . - Coffee , please . Two . - Field communications ? Yeah , we 're established . Honey , slide over a second . Dr Anna Nolmar . Psychologist , born Budapest , Hungary . Food 's here , come and get it . Very funny . Do you mind disarming this thing , please ? You ... ! - You ! - Come here . Calm down . I had to make sure that you wouldn 't leave . Stick with me through the night . I 'll let you go in the morning , I promise . Is that the best you could do ? Yeah . Hope you 're not on a diet . Robbery , Homicide . Sanchez . Sanchez , I 've got Dr Nolmar . But I 'm ready to release her to you , personally . Only to you . I don 't want any other cop or detective involved . - If I see another cop it 's a no-show . - Understood . Maya Theater on Sixth and Hill Street . Got it . Maya Theater . - Can you be there in 2O minutes ? - Got it . - Alone . - Now , listen , Eddy . Hold on ... - It 's done . - Thank you . Sorry I had to take your car . - I 'll send you a check or something . - OK . - Eddy . - Yeah ? Nothing . Regola ? Thank you . Our top story of the hour . A powerful explosion rocked the centre block of Olympic Boulevard this morning . Police suspect the bomb was planted in the offices of Dr Anna Nolmar , a psychiatrist believed abducted by one of her patients . Authorities would not comment ... It 's her . Dr Nolmar . - Detective Sanchez . - Do you need medical attention ? I 'm so relieved to see you . It 's been such an ordeal . Eddy ! Grab me , tight ! Upstairs , go ! Get down ! What are you doing ? They 're shooting up there ! Quiet . Love this . When I fire , cross ! Go ! No ! God ! Shit . - What ? - Go over . Let go ! Let go ! Let go ! Baby ! God ! Out ! Go , go ! Eddy , I 'm so scared . I know , I know . We gotta disappear . Where ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I could pay somebody to take us to Mexico . - I thought you were in the hospital . - Good to see you back , Sanchez . - You look like shit . - Thanks so much . What 's the story on those stiffs ? Same as Kay . Names and social securities - help yourself - are individuals who died in Vietnam . Who the hell are they ? Some crazy vet gang ? It gets better . See , these guys never got near Vietnam . Each of these stiffs has two separate identities , both fully documented . All three are convicted murderers . We 're talking some vicious motherfuckers . I don 't get it . Are you telling me that all these motherfuckers got sprung ? No , all these motherfuckers got sent to the same cuckoo nest , Lang Institute . Go figure . All right , it 's her bank card . Where ? At the Olivera and Alameda branch . Call the guards . We 're in business . Get the chopper ready . She 's at an ATM at Olivera and Alameda . Estimate you have 35 seconds . She made a selection . 25 seconds . Estimate ten seconds . Transaction processed . Go there . - Hurry up ! - I 'm waiting for the receipt . Fuck the receipt ! Come on ! Get in . - Straight to Mexico , OK ? - OK . Sorry about your father 's watch . I know it meant a lot to you . That 's OK . I 'll live . Maybe . I 'm sorry . I haven 't cried in years . I didn 't even cry at my father 's funeral . He trained me to hold back my emotions . He didn 't want me to be vulnerable . Buenos dies , amigo . I suppose I 'd better go and get some local currency . As long as there is poverty ... My God ! Too much to drink ? It 's OK . I 'm a doctor . We 're fine , thank you . We 're fine . I don 't really know what I did . I think I have killed . I can 't do this . Sorry , I can 't do this . Can 't do what ? I can 't live like this . I have to know what I did . - I have to go back . - Where ? The Lang Institute . There 's nothing there . I called to check your records . - It 's been shut for 13 years . - Where is it ? - Arizona . - Where in Arizona ? Oracle , Arizona . Here we go again ! Are you married , Colonel ? - No . You ? - Yes . Three kids . I 've got a son at Harvard . - Car rental , San Diego . Silver Taurus . - They 're on plastic . They 'll have to come up for air again . Send a team . Do ' em before tomorrow night , we 're operational . Do you want some ? Studies prove it will help you live longer . Thanks , doc . It 's Anna . I think by now you can call me Anna . Anna . It 's a nice name . Take a right here . What kind of people would do this ? Eddy . Eddy , look at this . This doesn 't make any sense . " Military personnel only . No admittance beyond this point . " Why would they have something like this in a mental institution ? It 's just a bat . No , it 's hydraulic . The power 's been off for years . Most medical facilities have a back-up generator . How ... Is this the place ? This is where I started . It feels right . Familiar . I just want to lie down . Not go anywhere . This is home . Just right . Shut my eyes . Home . Eddy , can you hear me ? Eddy ! Eddy , can you hear me ? Eddy ! Shit ! My God ! This is me ! This is incredible . Totally ingenious . Eddy , are you OK ? They made me Eddy Kay . They did it to me . They made me Eddy Kay . I remember ... I remember ... Yes , I remember . Hello , Eddy . You 're looking good today . What is your name ? Your name ... is Eddy Kay . My name is Oliver Dykstra . Your name ... is Eddy Kay . What is your name , Eddy ? Tell me . My name is Eddy Kay . My name is Eddy Kay . I 'm your girl . Yes . This is brilliant . Absolutely brilliant . That 's the man I killed . That 's the man I killed . You didn 't kill anybody , Eddy . It 's not a real memory . It 's an induced memory . You were brainwashed , practically recreated through a rebirth process . These images represent artificial experiences imprinted on your mind , reinforced by pain and pleasure . It 's all fake . None of this is real , Eddy . You 're not a murderer . - You 're not a murderer . - My God . I 'm not a murderer ! I 'm not a murderer . I 'm a ... This is real . This is real . This is real . Talk to me . Let it out . Talk to me . Are you OK ? Hurry , Eddy . Hold on to me . Come on . I 'm back . I got that stuff you wanted . I also bought us some new clothes . I think these have had it . Eddy ? I 'm sorry I keep calling you Eddy . I don 't know what else to call you . It 's so difficult to accept what these people did to you . Is it OK if I call my uncle ? He 's probably worried to death about me . I 'd like to place a call . My calling card number is 213658214153 . We are ready , sir . But it 's your decision . He 's surfaced again . Look at you . - Are you OK ? - I 'm all right . Just angry - God , these look terrible . You know ... When I was small , my mother used to kiss the pain away . Didn 't yours ? Sorry . I 'm sorry . Look 2A you . Eddy ? Eddy , is that you ? - Where is he ? - I don 't know . - Don 't shoot me . - Where is he ? I don 't know . Please believe me , I don 't know . - Where is he ? - I don 't know where he is ! Get off me ! God ! - Say A. - Don 't shoot me . - Wait . - Don 't shoot me . This will only take a minute . Please don 't hurt me . Get off ! Get off me ! Get off me ! Don 't move ! - Make the call . - You don 't stand a chance . It 'll only buy you 24 hours . You won 't shoot me in cold blood . You didn 't have it in you then , and you don 't now . - I know you well , remember ? - Give me that water bottle . Make the call . - Hello ? - It 's me . - Where are you calling from ? - From Oracle . - It 's done . - Good work . See you at the Duke . What duke were you talking about ? - I didn 't say anything about a duke . - Yes , you did . In the parking structure , you said you wanted to talk about the duke . The Duke Hotel . The new Attorney General . Dean ... Jordan . They 're gonna kill him . - When ? - Tonight . Nine o 'clock . You really didn 't know , did you ? Can 't complain , Colonel . - Hey , Ron . - Taylor , you look busy . Thank you , sir . Step through , sir . Excuse me . Yes . I am so excited . He 's our man . - Where 's the rest room ? - Straight down the hall , sir . - Could I get a shine ? - Have a seat . What time is it ? It 's almost eight . We won 't make it . How about a kiss for good luck ? The man of the hour , a man not afraid to expose the truth , and a man who feels that America should lead by example as we pave the way for a global democracy in the 21 st century . I give you the next Attorney General of the United States , Dean Jordan ! I hope we 're not too late . My God ! We have witnessed extraordinary events this past year . Dictatorships toppled ... Eddy , it 's the police . The right to pursue individual happiness . If Eastern Europe can clean up its act ... Get out the car ! - Get out ! Where 's the driver ? - Don 't shoot me ! - Get out the car ! - I want Detective Sanchez . Detective Sanchez knows all about this . Excuse me , sir . I admit it again ... I have to get inside . It 's an emergency . Sir , do you have a ticket ? - No . I lost my ticket . - Can 't help you without a ticket . - Who 's in charge ? - Sorry , sir . Can 't help you without a ticket . In order to maximise the potential of our great democratic institution ... Come on . Excuse me , sir . I 've got a problem . I lost my ticket . No , no , no ... Look at this watch . It 's a $ 1,200 watch . Give me your ticket , I 'll give you the watch . - Please . It 's really important to me . - I don 't like these things . Have fun . It was in my jacket the whole time . Believe me , it 's mine . Thank you . To expose ... We will take the reins away from these usurpers of power . Never again will common criminals be licensed to act in the name of this country . Do you mind ? I must prepare for some of the most difficult years of my career . Hey , what 's happening ? - She 's in the back . - Detective Sanchez , here I am . Hurry . Eddy 's at the Duke Hotel . They 're after Jordan . Release her at once , please . The bureaucrats and the politicians have asked me not to rock the boat not to roll stones that have gathered moss , not to re-open old wounds . Let it be said that there are some dark corners of this great democracy of ours that are afraid of close scrutiny . There must not be a government agency that is so mighty as to be allowed to exist outside the walls of this country ... The man in the brown jacket . Get a man on him . I played basketball for Ohio State University . I was not the most talented player but I played with enthusiasm . ... the old cliche , no pain and no gain . There he is ! There ! Get down , sir ! Shit . It 's over ! You hear me ? It 's over ! They used you , like they used me , don 't you understand ? - We 're not enemies . - Fuck you ! Hello , Eddy . What a waste . You were the best . See you in hell . Thank God . The nightmare 's over , Eddy . It 's finished . It 's finished . It 's finished ... it 's finished .

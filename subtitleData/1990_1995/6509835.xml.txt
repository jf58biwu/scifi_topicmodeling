 Hall trying to stay away from him . Come on , man . Come on . Come on , now . Put him down . Put him down ! - Oh ! - Hey , man . Watch it ! - Come on , Upshaw ! Let 's go ! - You 're a moron , Tiernan . You 're both morons . And who 's watching the floor ? - What 's his name , the skink . - Guess who died this afternoon . - Mrs Richardson . - Face plant in a bowl of puddin ' . - I don 't suppose you changed her room . - Oh , no . We left that for you . Oh ! Now Hall 's against the ropes ! OK . Party 's over , gents . Why 'd you do that ? - Cos rules are rules , Stan . - Ach ! And I 'm the queen bitch around here . - Gung said we can watch the fight . - Yeah ? Do I look like Gung to you ? No . You got a better figure . You wanna keep that hand , Hal , you better let go . How about a little sponge bath ? How about I take care of these wandering ' hands of yours ? Come here . - You like strapping ' me down , don 't you ? - Oh , yeah . I really get off on it . Hey , Gung . No TV after nine o 'clock . Do you understand ? - Dr Grago said they 're getting better ... - Oh , right ! That 's because they don 't pinch his butt every time he walks into the room . Argh ! Oh ! No ! Somebody help me ! Somebody , please ! Please ! Help me ! Please , help me ! Please ! Good morning . Whatever tape you found in that VCR , it isn 't mine . Good , because I put it back with all those others that aren 't yours . Well , this definitely isn 't mine . No . This is Michelle Charters . She 's a nurse at a convalescent home in Worcester , Massachusetts . - What happened to her ? - According to Miss Charters , she was raped . The abrasions would be consistent with her claims , as would be the medical report ... .. which cites the kind of injury associated with sexual trauma . - Where 'd you get this ? Violent Crimes ? - No , the woman made the video herself . No one will believe her story . Why not ? Because she claims to have been raped by an invisible entity , a spirit being . I have X-Files that document similar cases . I know . I 've been going through them . None of them have ever been substantiated . - Not surprisingly . - Given the emotional violence of rape , ... .. the face of the attacker is often erased from memory . That he could be perceived as invisible is a logical leap from there . - Yes , but this case is different . - Why ? She has filed a lawsuit against the government . She seems to be certain who the spirit being is . Mr Arden . - Hal Arden . - And you know him ... ? He 's been a patient where I work for about five years . The facts of your case seem to contravene those of other cases we have . Right . You mean , the other " woman raped by invisible man " cases ? How do you know it was him who attacked you ? He made advances toward me . And he said things , rude things . When you bathe somebody every day , ... .. you get to know more about them than you really need to . An old man smells a certain way ... .. and he feels a certain way . - I know this is hard for you . - No , this is the easy part . " Hard " is not getting leave or workman 's comp , ... .. and having to go back to work with this ... guy . To continue our investigation , we 're gonna need some evidence , physical or ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . I know . I 've heard it . Unless you have hair or semen or fibres or whatever , you guys can 't build a case . That 's right . Look , I didn 't make this up , OK ? I was attacked . And I 'm not a shrinking violet who would repress the memory of a rapist 's face . If I could positively ID him or give you something to incriminate the man , I would . You gotta be kidding me ! What do I think about her claims ? Huh ! I should be in the Guinness Record Book . I 'm 74 years old . I 've got plumbing older than this building . Hm ? And it don 't work much better either . Thank you for sharing . Are you aware you 're named in a lawsuit against the government ? - I am ? - Did you ever threaten Miss Charters ? - What ? - Did you ever threaten Miss Charters ? Threaten ? It was harmless , for cryin ' out loud . Ever since this sex-harassment fad , men can 't say what 's on their minds . - She says you made advances . - Hm ? Advances ? If I told you you were a pretty woman and I would like to show you some affection , ... .. would you be offended ? Oh , I didn 't mean to step on your toes there . Sir , there seems to be some confusion here . Yeah . I thought nurse what 's her name said she was rogered by a ghost . I may have one foot in the grave , but I can 't fly down hallways spreading amore . Apparently not . If ... that 's what it 's like ... If that 's what it 's like in heaven , ... .. Lord , take me now ! - What do you think , Mulder ? - About his plumbing ? - About his story . - I think this is gonna be a waste of time , ... .. like all the other X-Files on entity rape . Unsubstantiated phenomena . But in a substantiated crime . Hey , pay attention or you 'll take another bath with your clothes on . At five and a half bucks an hour , I don 't give a rat 's ass either way . Ten years ago , Excelsis was a leading facility in care of the elderly . Then funding was out . We were all but shut down . - Only a few wings are operational now . - Is there a medical staff ? Not on site . Dr Grago visits three times a week . Residents are very well looked after , though . We have a high standard of health treatment . - What kind of treatment ? - We specialise in the care ... .. of the degenerative diseases : Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's . - We met with a patient today . - We prefer " resident " , actually . We met a resident who has Alzheimer 's , but he actually seemed quite spry and alert . You 're speaking of Hal Arden , the man accused of assaulting Michelle Charters . - Was he receiving special treatment ? - You 'd have to speak to Dr Grago . Hal has been here almost eight years now . We 're all quite fond of him . We were extremely dismayed over this whole business with the lawsuit . Are you saying you don 't believe Nurse Charters ' allegations of rape ? There 's something I 'd like to show you . - What did you tell ' em ? - I didn 't tell ' em anything . - Why are they still here ? - I don 't know , Stan . - Now , you gotta be more careful . - I am careful . You 're gonna ruin it for all of us . If they find out , it all goes for nothin ' . I didn 't tell ' em anything . I 'm not going to die in this godforsaken hole ! Do you hear me ? Oh , back off , Stan . Where did you get that ? I know where he keeps ' em . Give me one , Stan . Huh ? I want another one , too . You can 't handle another one . Oh , yeah ? Maybe I 'll just rat you out , then , huh ? How would you like that ? This is Michelle Charters ' ? There are three separate insurance claims ... .. for accidents on the job . In April , she requested leave with full pay due to job-related emotional stress . The request was summarily rejected . There 's more . - I 'd like to review it myself . - Certainly . Mrs Dawson , did you see Michelle after the incident and her injuries ? I wasn 't here that night , but I did see her the following day . - Then you know how badly she was hurt . - Yes . Do you think she staged the attack ? We need help . Mr Arden 's choking to death ! See ? See what happened ? I told you you couldn 't handle any more ! Call 911 ! Hal ? Can you speak ? He 's in ventricular fibrillation . I need 75mg of lidocaine and one amp of epinephrine . - Stat . - Get a defibrillator ! He 's cyanotic . - Come on , Hal , help me . - Come on , Hal . - One , two , three , four . - The ambulance is on the way . I 'm losing him . What 's taking so long ? ! Still no pulse . Where 's that crash cart ? ! Hal Arden 's been my patient since he came here eight years ago . - This really is a setback . - A setback ? Hal was part of a group of patients I 've been treating for 11 months . - But Alzheimer 's isn 't treatable . - It 's an experimental drug called Depranil ... .. that increases acetylcholine in the brain . I 've read that the clinical benefits are marginal at best . Well , yes . But these patients show cognitive abilities well beyond anything that 's been reported . So he was actually getting better ? Before he started receiving the drug he could hardly complete a sentence . Look ... It 's not much to get excited about , my work . Most of these people are on the downhill slide . If I can make them comfortable , maybe prolong a life , it 's all they expect . But to reverse an illness ... Would it be possible for us to see other patients in your test group ? - Sure , if you want to . - Yeah . - Where 'd you get that ? - Aw , it was Hal 's . Since he 's not here any more , why can 't I have it ? Because you have enough . I give you enough . It 's our secret . Aw , come on , Gung . It 's makin ' me better . Too much is very bad . Very bad . No more for you . I want you to stand behind Ben , Eddie , because Ben 's taller . And ... Oh , Gloria , would you come on over here ? That man there , that 's Leo Kreutzer . During the Depression he was a WPA artist . - Quite a good one , too , I 'm told . - Hello , Mabel . Don 't you look lovely ! - Is he receiving the same treatment as Hal ? - Yes . When he came to us he couldn 't draw a circle . Now ... Well , you can see for yourself . You 'll have to excuse me . I 'm behind on rounds . Can I get a copy of Hal 's autopsy results ? - Of course . - Thank you . May I sit down , Leo ? Leo , we 're with the FBI . We have some questions that we 'd like to ask you . Leo 's a brilliant artist , you know . Oh , don 't be so modest , Leo . President Kennedy has one of his paintings in the White House . Dr Grago tells us that you haven 't worked in years , that the medicine ... It ain 't the medication . What is it , then ? OK , Rembrandt , dinner time . Dorothy , legs up and straight ahead . - You don 't want a flat tyre . - Wait ! Leo 's not finished . Leo can finish with you later . - No , no ... He still has to draw the rest . - He 'll do it later , honey . Come on , Leo . Don 't make me embarrass you in front of your friends . Come on , Scully . Let 's get out of here . To find a treatment and cure for Alzheimer 's , do you realise how important that would be ? If it 'd keep anybody out of a place like that , yes . - I wouldn 't say those people were cured . - Any progress at all ... I hope somebody 's making progress cos we have a big goose egg . - Checking out of room 206 and 210 , please . - Certainly , sir . What if there 's a connection ? Between the rape case and the Alzheimer 's ? When they 're not drawing pictures , they 're sex offenders ? Dr Grago 's drug therapy produces acetylcholine . Too much cholinergic activity can cause a psychotic state similar to schizophrenia . You think Michelle Charters was raped by a 74-year-old schizophrenic ? - It 's possible . - An invisible 74-year-old schizophrenic ? Maybe it 's not the medication . Maybe it 's the place itself . Are you saying it 's haunted ? You 've been working with me for too long . I 'm talking about an environmental reason behind what 's happening . The disinfectant couldn 't mask that smell . Who knows what 's behind the walls ? Some fungal contaminants have been known to cause delusions , dementia , violence . - Why hasn 't it affected the other residents ? - Maybe it has . You 're looking too hard for something that 's not there . I think Michelle Charters concocted this story to get out of a job she hates . Her lip required 13 stitches . The blow to her head caused a subdural haematoma . That 's quite a concoction . I want to talk to a few more of the patients . We can catch the same flight out tomorrow night . This is gourmet fare . Be a good girl and open wide . - No , no , no . Please don 't . - Come on . - Come on , open up , honey . Come on ! - No , please don 't . I don 't want ... OK , that 's fine , Dorothy . Starve to death . See if I care . Why aren 't you eating your food , Leo ? What 's the matter ? It 's Dorothy . She needs more . We both do . What you have is enough . It 's not working for us , not like it works for the others . - We need more . - No ! No . Eat your food , please . I 'll come back and pick up your tray . It 's OK , Dorothy . Don 't worry . I think Stan has some more hidden away somewhere . It 'll be all right . - Why are you being so stubborn ? - I 'm not . I like it here . A year ago you were begging to live with us . Well , things change . Look , Dad , I am sorry about what happened to Mr Arlen . - Arden . His name was Arden . - I finished your packing , Mr Phillips . I 'm gonna make sure you didn 't forget anything . OK . Don 't worry . Just pull your car up front . I 'll make sure he gets down OK . - Thank you . - He 's gonna be just fine . - Can I help you ? - We 'd like a word with Mr Phillips . - I 'm his daughter . What is this about ? - We 're with the FBI . We have a few questions concerning his medical treatment . He 's in there packing . I 'm about to take him home . Is there anything I can help you with ? It 's sad . My two girls won 't even visit their grandfather . They 're too afraid to come here . It 's hard for anyone , including the residents . That 's why we decided that whatever time he 's got left , we want him to spend it with us . - How many years has he been here ? - Almost three . We didn 't have a choice . Jack and I both work . The doctor said that he needed 24-hour nursing assistance . He doesn 't seem to need much assistance now . Has his improvement been that pronounced ? I thought I was bringing him here to die . They told me he 'd only get worse - the physical deterioration , the dementia . - And now it 's like he 's a different person . - Do you have any idea why ? It has something to do with Dr Grago 's treatment . Dad won 't talk to me about it . He 's just too angry . He was so angry when I brought him here . Now he 's angry that I wanna take him home . I don 't know that he 's ever gonna forgive me . I 'd like to say I 'm gonna miss you , Stan . But the truth is , you are a royal pain in the butt . Hey ! Where you goin ' ? Don 't make me chase you , old man . Hey ! What are you , a track star all of a sudden ? OK , stop messin ' around , Stan . Crawl back in that window right now ! You crawl back in there ! Don 't think I 'm comin ' over there to get you . I 'd just as soon let you fall and break your neck ! Do you hear me , Stan ? Do you hear me ? Help me ! Somebody help me , please ! I 'm gonna fall ! Help ! Help me ! Give me your hand . - Come on . Come on ! - I can 't ... - Grab it ! - I can 't ! Argh ! Oh , my God ! They paged me . I got a message - an orderly fell out a fourth-floor window ? Apparently . Either that or he was pushed . - Was Stan involved ? - We 're trying to find out . Stan was with him just prior to the accident . You 're not suggesting he could 've done it ? There 's been two deaths in 24 hours . Stan 's been present before both . No , no . That 's impossible . He has a degenerative hip disease . - No way could he get to the fourth floor . - What about an elevator ? - They haven 't worked for years . - Maybe he was helped . Helped ? By whom ? I don 't know . The postmortem on Hal Arden . Did you get it yet ? - No , but they promised they 'll fax it today . - Can we see if it 's come in ? Sure . What do you expect to find ? I 'm not sure exactly . Why are they questioning him ? It 's routine procedure . Are they gonna want to keep him here ? You 'll have to ask Dr Grago . - Oh , God ! If my mother was alive ... - How can I handle this by myself ? I don 't know . I have other things to deal with right now . - Well , so do I. I 'd just like some help . - Excuse me . - Are you the only one on ? - Yes . Upshaw never showed up for work . Nobody 's ever listening to me ! I said something was going on ! I told you it had to do with Mr Arden and Mr Phillips . Forget it . Can you please explain to me what 's going on around here ? Shoo ! Shoo ! Go away ! Go , go away ! Leave me alone ! Go back ! Don 't come any closer ! Go back in your room , Dorothy . I 'll send an orderly in to see you . - No , no , they 're in there . - Who ? All of them . - There 's nobody in your room , Dorothy . - Here they come ! You 'll see . All right , now . You be nice . I don 't want any more of your dirty tricks ! - Is she gonna be all right ? - Mm . No ! No , no , no ! I don 't ... I don 't wanna go back in there . No ! No , I don 't ... It 's senile dementia . This is just an episode . You leave her be . Don 't you touch her ! Now , shoo ! Go away ! Go away ! Don 't you get any ideas , mister ! Excuse me . Now don 't you follow her ! - This is it . - Is the toxicology there ? Yes . - This shouldn 't be here . - What 's that ? Ibotenic acid . How did that get in his blood ? What 's ibotenic acid ? - I think it 's a kind of poison . - Mulder ... Scully , look at this . Hal Arden had ibotenic acid in his blood . Somebody poisoned him . Well , not necessarily . This is only a trace amount . But small amounts can cause hallucinations , which is what a patient is having right now . But where did they get it ? Excuse me . You 've gotta come quickly . Oh , my God ! - This is fantastic . - What 's going on here ? Leo ? It 's incredible . You 've got an Asian orderly working here . What 's his name ? - Uh ... Gung , I think . - Do you know where he is ? Somewhere down in the basement . Upshaw . You must believe me . I didn 't kill him . - But it 's your mushroom crop , isn 't it ? - Yes . - Who else would have buried him there ? - Why were you growing them ? For medicinal purposes . Were you feeding them to the residents ? Yes . But only in small amounts . Why ? Because it makes them feel better . - It makes them feel better or it kills them ? - No . Exactly what kind of mushrooms are they ? It 's from my prefecture in my country . They 've been used for centuries . For what purpose ? In my country our customs are different . You 're not in your country now . You 're hired here to care for these people under our guidelines . Where I come from , many generations live under one roof . As children , our grandparents live with us . We feel a duty to take care of them . It isn 't like that in this country . We respect our old people as we respect our ancestors . We don 't send them away to die , like Stan and Hal . - These people get excellent medical care . - But they 're not treated with respect . Hal 's family never came to visit him once . And the orderlies treat the residents worse than dogs . No one is mistreated here . - You are not here to see . - All right ! Gung , who killed the orderly ? Who buried him in that room ? Something has gone very wrong . The mushrooms we take to speak with the dead , to see our ancestors in the spirit world . But the spirit in this place is very angry ... .. and the souls that died here continue to suffer . And now they have been awakened . Are you saying that a spirit killed this man Upshaw ? Yes . They 've taken revenge for their mistreatment . How are the mushrooms taken ? Dried , mixed with many herbs , made into powder . We should make sure nobody else takes them . You check on the other patients . Gung , come with me . Let 's go . Come in , please . Someone 's taken them all . - I think you 're right . - About ? What 's been happening here is a result of the medication , but not the doctor 's medication . Mushrooms aren 't medication . They 're good on burgers but they don 't raise the dead . Shamans have been using them for centuries to gain entrance to the spirit world . You 've been reading too much Carlos Castaneda . All right . Ask any anthropologist , then . I know . A shaman gets intoxicated , he has dreams or hallucinations and interprets them . I don 't think it 's any more magical than that . I don 't know how else to explain what 's happening here . Well , I think these mushrooms are a poison to the system , ... .. and that 's what killed Hal Arden . And raped Michelle Charters and killed those two orderlies ? Something 's been unleashed . I don 't know how to explain it , but it has something to do with those pills . Daddy ? Daddy , what are you taking ? What are you putting in your mouth ? Go away ! You go away ! Go away ! Go away ! You leave me ! Leave us alone ! Go on ! Oh ! Run . Run while you can . Go on , run ! Run ... Go away ! Go away ! You leave us alone ! - Dorothy , I need you ! - Leave Leo alone . - Please ! - Leave him alone . Leo ! Leave him alone ... You leave him . You leave him ! Oh ... Oh , no ! Stop ! Stop them ! Please ! Argh ! Help ! Help me ! Please ! Argh ! Mulder ? What 's going on ? Mulder ? Scully ! Turn off the water main ! Turn off the water main ! They 're trapped and it 's filling with water ! - What ? - Where 's the main water shut-off ? I don 't know . Gung will know . Keep trying the door . You 've gotta get up . Come on , you 've gotta get up . Come on . It 's stuck . See if you can find something to force it with . I can 't open the drains . Please ! Please , my father needs help . My father took something . I 'm afraid he 's dying . You stay with him . I 'll get help . Dr Grago ! - Dr Grago ... - Sealed tight . - Do you have any atropine in your kit here ? - I might . Yes , I think so . Stan Phillips has gone into convulsions . I think he might have poisoned himself . Just hang on . They 're gone . They 're gone ! They 're all gone . You OK , Mulder ? Yeah , fine . In response to the unexplained incidents at the Excelsis Dei home , ... .. the Massachusetts Dept of Public Health has assumed all administrative authority there . They detected trace amounts of ibotenic acid in more than half the residents tested ... .. though these levels have dissipated rapidly . Dr John Grago has been replaced and his trial use of the drug Depranil has been suspended . For his part in manufacturing and distributing an illicit substance , ... .. Gung Bituen was remanded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service ... .. and is awaiting repatriation to Malaysia . There are reportedly no efforts being made to study the mushrooms . The government settled Michelle Charters ' lawsuit out of court ... .. though no clear blame has been placed . Witnesses were unreliable due to dramatic relapses ... .. and a general reversal in their progress with Alzheimer 's disease . I 'm gonna go now , Daddy . I 'll see you again soon . Maybe next week . I made this !

[ Woman ] This is my daughter 's apartment . Letmego ! Ihave toget through ! lhave togetin ! Mrs. Scully ? She 's not in there . Where is she ? Where isshe ? [ Woman ] This is Holly Weirreporting live . Policehave refusedtoidentify thekidnapping victim . However , we have received unconfirmed information- - Iknewit wouldhappen this way . I had this dream about Dana being taken away . It 's so strange ! [ Camera ShutterClicking ] I , uh- - I was gonna call her ... but I was afraid I was gonna scare her . [ Sighs ] She would have laughed at me anyway . She doesn 't believe in that kind ofthing , you know ? [ Horn Honking ] [ Man ] According to thereports I 've reviewed ... Agent Scully 's research states that Duane Barry 's propensity forviolent , deviant behavior ... is due to brain damage from a bullet wound in the head . Is this the operational opinion ? - Yes , sir . [ Clears Throat ] - Is there another ? He 's convinced he 's going to be abducted by aliens . Butby takingsomeone to theabductionsite ... he won 't be abducted himself . That he 's following orders from alien voices in his head . [ Man # 1 ] Yes . Well , that 's an interesting spin on the Nuremberg defense . Which explanation doyou subscribe to , Agent Mulder ? There 's a question ofhow he could have gotten to her in the first place . And you think these alien voices told him . Agent Scullywas carrying a small piece ofmetal ... that was removed from Duane Barry 's abdomen- - an implant he described as a tracking device . AgentScully ... thought thatyouhadmade ... a major miscalculation in Duane Barry 's psychosis . - Is that true ? - Yes , but that doesn 't explain how he could 've found her . [ Skinner ] Where wouldhebe takingher ? Idon 'tknow . He- - He talkedaboutamountain ... but he wasn 't specific about the location . Howeverhegot toher andwhateverhismotives , he tookScully 's carandweapon . I think weall understand theseriousness ofthismatter andshouldproceedquickly ... with all possible resources . - I need you to turn over your files to H.R.T. - I 'd like to briefthem myself . Go home . You 've been up all night . Get some sleep . Sir , I know Duane Barry . I 've been in his head . - I know how he thinks . - You 're too close to this case ! Ifwe can useyou , we will . - Sir- - - That 's an order , Agent Mulder . Make sure he gets home safely .

He thinks Scully 's been taken up to Skyland Mountain . I 'll hold him off until they locate her . Wait . Here he comes . I 'll be in touch . Come on . Let 's go . - [ Horn Blaring ] - Hey ! [ Relieved Sigh ] You 're dozing off . - Maybe I should drive . - I 'm fine . - You haven 't sleptyet . I have . - I said I 'm fine . [ Scoffs ] [ Sighs ] You know , Chernobyl , Exxon Valdez , Three Mile Island ... theywere all linked to sleep deprivation . The U.S. Department ofTransportation estimates ... that over 1 90,000 fatal car crashes everyyear are caused by sleepiness . Did they estimate how many people are put to sleep listening to their statistics ? I 'm just trying to keepyou awake . Look , I knowyou think we should have told Skinner . But ifhe sends in the whole cavalry , Duane Barry might go over the edge . - You 're right . - Ifwe find him first , we 'll notify the Bureau . - All right ? - Yeah . You think he tracked her down with that implant ? Well , that 's the easiest explanation . It 's also the most implausible . - Is there another possibility ? - Somebody could 've given him her address . I don 't know who . There 's our turnoff . - Haveyouseen thisguy ? - Yeah , he was here . [ Krycek ] He 's wanted forkidnappinga federalagent . Did you let him go up on the tram ? No way .

No way . Wejust got done refitting the cable .

" [ CarApproaching ] - Keep an eye on him . - [ Man ] Okay . - You got Duane Barry ? - Yes , sir . Agent Mulder , you disobeyed my direct order . [ Man ] Call theparamedics !

[ ResuscitatorResumes Breathing ] One , two , three- - [ Men Chattering ] Excuse me . I 'm Agent Mulder . I 'd like a copy ofthis man 's autopsy report . I 'm sorry . It 's still incomplete . - Areyou the pathologist ? - Yes . - Can I askwhatyour preliminary findings are ? - [ Sighs ] Um , second-degree burns on the face ... contusions about the neck , bruised larynx . Ifl had to list cause ofdeath at this point , I 'd have to say asphyxiation . Wereyou expecting something else ? You haven 't run a toxicological yet ? - They should be finished shortly . - I 'dbeinterestedtosee whatyoufiind . - When will it be on file ? - Later this morning . I 'd like a copy as soon as possible , please . Well , I 'm sorry . You 'll have to go through regular military channels . What doyou mean , " military " ? - You 're not F.B.I. ? - Quantico 's under militaryjurisdiction . There wasn 't an F.B.I. pathologist available this morning . [ Clears Throat ] Skinner 's expecting my report on the Duane Barry incident . What do I tell him ? - The truth . - What doyou mean ? Confirm Mulder 's version ofevents . You 've earned his trust . - The objectnowis topreserveit . - For how much longer ? Until your assignment is completed . - If Mulder 's such a threat , why not eliminate him ? - That 's not policy . It 's not ? Afterwhatyou had me do ? Kill Mulder and you risk turning one man 's religion into a crusade . What about Scully ? - We 've taken care ofthat . - How ? We tell you only whatyou need to know . - I think I have a right to know . - You have no rights ... only orders to be carried out . Ifyou have a problem with that , we 'll make other arrangements . " Victim appears tohave expired fromprolongedhypoxemia ... secondary to asphyxiation . Ofseveralpossible etiologies , themostlikelyisstrangulation ... due to thepresence ofcontusions andabruisedlarynx . " Doyou want tospeak to this , AgentMulder ? I didn 't kill him , ifthat 's whatyou 're suggesting . - Butyou attacked him ? - I was interrogating him about Agent Scully . He wasn 't cooperating , so I pushed him . And you lost control ? Momentarily , but then I left the room . He was verymuchalive . Ispoke tohim . AgentKrycekspoke tohim . Agent Krycek says he entered the room because the suspect was gagging . Is Agent Krycek asserting that I killed him too ? No . He corroborates your story . But the fact is , we 've got a dead suspect , Agent Mulder ... and no other plausible cause ofdeath . O.P.C. wants the both ofyou to take a lie detector test . You are to report there immediately . There is another plausible cause ofdeath . Which is ? Poisoning by injection or ingestion . - Poisoning ? - You won 't find that on the navy pathologist 's report . What areyou saying , Agent Mulder ? That the autopsy is incomplete , that the military covered up the toxicological findings . - And whywould they do that ? - Because they know where Scully is . - Why areyou so paranoid , Mulder ? - Oh , I don 't know . Maybe it 's because I find it hard to trust anybody . [ DoorCloses ] Alex . Alex , can I borrowyour carkeys ? - Why ? Where areyou going ? - There 's somebody I gotta see . - But we 're scheduled at O.P.C.- - - I know.Just give me the keys , please . - [ Sighs ] - Thanks . You wasted a trip , Mr. Mulder . - There 's nothing the senator can do foryou now . - What ? - Not withoutcommitting politicalsuicide . - Why ? Do they have something on him ? Theyhavesomething on everyone , Mr. Mulder . The question is when they 'll use it . - I need his help . - No one can helpyou now . Your channels ofappeal and recourse are closed . Your predecessor could have helped me . You know , don 'tyou ? You know what 's happened to her . This reaches beyond any ofus , Mr. Mulder . Even my predecessor . I want an answer ! Why kill Duane Barry ifthere was nothing to hide ? You mean the government ? There are no answers foryou , Mr. Mulder . They only have one policy : Deny everything . [ Sighs ] This is a serious allegation , Agent Mulder . Only so far as it is true . " Agent Krycekwas hired or suborned by an outside agency ... to impede a federal investigation and may be responsible ... for the death ofa suspect in a capital murder case " ? It goes on . " And the possible murder ofthe tram operator at Skyland Mountain . " There 's a lot ofblood on this document , Agent Mulder . - Areyou standing behind this going on the record ? - Yes , sir . Well , then you 'd damn well better have the facts to back it up . - [ Intercom Beeps ] - I need to see Agent Krycek , immediately . [ Sighs ] I can 't protectyou , Agent Mulder . Past a point , this 'll become a larger Bureau matter . All right . What doyou got ? I found this in Agent Krycek 's car . He doesn 't smoke . AgentKrycek was thelastperson with Duane Barrybeforehe died . He wasalso thelastperson tosee the tram operatorbeforehe disappeared . When I got to the top ofSkyland Mountain ... I saw an unmarked helicopter working the area . Ibelieve thatAgentKrycek gaveaway the whereabouts ... of Duane Barry and Agent Scully to whoever he 's working with . - And who is that ? - I don 't know . The military ? Some covert organization within the government ? Whoever it is that the man who smokes those cigarettes works for . - Why ? - Because Agent Scully got too close ... to whatever it is they 're trying to deny . Because she had hard and damning evidence- - that metallic implant in her possession . Orbecause hertermination ... would prevent further involvement with me and mywork . Doyou think Agent Scully 's dead ? I don 't know . How far doyou think they 'd go ? What doyou know about Agent Krycek ? - I didn 't give him the assignment . I only- - - [ Phone Ringing ] Yes . Thankyou . Agent Krycek didn 't show up forwork this morning . His home number has been disconnected . That 's it ? He 's gone ? - Hejust disappears into the woodwork ? - So it would appear . Who are these people who can murderwith impunity , and we can 't do anything about it ? - Letitgo , AgentMulder . - Like hell . - There 's nothing you can do . - What can you do about it ? There 's only one thing that I can do , Agent Mulder . As ofright now , I 'm reopening the X-files . That 's what they fear the most . [ DoorOpens , Closes ] Agent Mulder ? Thankyou for calling me . I 'm sorry I don 't have better news . Doyou know something ? ls Dana okay ? I don 't know anything more about it . I knowyou 're doing all you can . I had that dream again last night , about Dana being taken away . I can 't tell you how it scares me . It 's probably scarier when you stop having the dream . Don 'tyou think ? Ifoundthis . That 's something l- - I never considered about her . Ifshe was- - Ifshe wassuchaskeptic ... why did she wear that ? I gave it to her on her 1 5th birthday . Don 'tyou want to keep it ?

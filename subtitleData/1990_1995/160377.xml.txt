 Here , let me do it . Putyour number in , then your card . What 's your number , Roland ? Three fifteen . See how easy it is ? Engine efficiency ? - Ninety-four percent . - We need more . How 's the back pressure holding ? What doyou think ? It 's climbing . Increase the blade inclination . I said- - The inclination ofthe blade is pi over nine . We 've reached maximum velocity . No ! Let it go ! It will work . It will destroy itself ! . I 'm not going to do that . It 's not going to destroy itself . Come on ! We 're almost there ! Our equations are wrong . - What happened ? - Nothing . He pulled the plug . I 'm just protecting the baby- - and fouryears ofwork . Fouryears that add up to zilch . Unless we show some progress ... they 're going to pull the plug on us , Ron . You should have continued with the test . Somebody 's going to crack Mach 1 5 ... and I want it to be us . I won 'tjeopardize everything becauseyou two ... can 't wait to see your name in print . It 's print that gets the money , Ron . Go down in fames together . Fine , go ahead . I 'm going to do the math . Good night , Dr. Keats . What the hell ? Roland . Open the door . Open the door ! Roland , I wantyou to listen to me very carefully . We have to open this door , Roland . Stop typing ! Roland ! Roland , open the door ! What areyou doing ? ! Open the door ! Roland , hit escape . Areyou listening ? ( screaming ) ( splat ) How was the wedding ? The part where the groom passed out ... or the dog bit the drummer ? Did you catch the bouquet ? Maybe . Is that whatyou couldn 't talk about over the phone ? The project everyone says doesn 't exist does exist . The Icarus project ? The next generation injet engine design . Capable ofdoubling current supersonic speeds ... using halfthe fuel , at least , in theory . And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist ... who worked on it here at the university . - Yes . - How close are they ? I 'm not sure , but Surnow 's the second team scientist ... to die in six months . But how is this an X file ? Mulder , you don 't think ... this has anything to do with U.F.O. technology ? There 's something unexplainable , Scully ... but it 's not unidentifiable . - Keats ? - There . Dr. Keats ? We 're with the F.B.I. I 'm Agent Mulder . This is Agent Scully . We understand you discovered Dr. Surnow this morning . What was left ofhim . How doyou suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel ? Someone must have shut him in . By computer ? We 've already been through this with the police . Another member ofyour team died recently ... isn 't that correct ? Yes . Arthur Grable . He was killed in an automobile accident in November . I 'm Frank Nollette . I 'm also on the project . Areyou certain it was an accident ? What areyou driving at ? Yourwork seems to be ... a perfect target for industrial espionage . Who wrote this ? Ron was working on it when I left . The handwriting here ... doesn 't match other handwriting on the board . It isn 't mine . What about Roland Fuller ? Uh ... Roland 's the , uh ... janitor . According to the police ... he was the only other person here . Roland didn 't do that . How doyou know ? Let 'sjust say Roland isn 't exactly a rocket scientist . Here . " Tracy . " - ( giggles ) - With stars . Woman : Roland . There are some people here to talkwith you . Uh-oh . I went offthe paper . Sorry . That 's all right , Roland . Tracy ? Would you help me in the TV room ? Okay . Hi , Roland . Mind ifwe sit down ? Thanks . Mind ifwe askyou a couple questions ? Doyou rememberworking last night ? Uh-huh . Doyou remember seeing anything unusual ? Seeing any strangers ? Did Dr. Surnow or Dr. Keats or Dr. Nollette ... do anything unusual ? Nope . You must like stars . One hundred and forty-seven . Sorry ? Stars . You like numbers , too , huh ? Roland , let me helpyou . One , two , three ... four , five ... six , seven , eight ... Roland ? ls everything okay ? Roland , areyou all right ? Eleven ... twelve , thirteen ... What happened ? What did you say to upset him so ? Sixteen , seventeen ... It 's definitely the work ofa fourth individual . Surnow 's , Keats ' and Nollette 's cursive standards ... don 't match whatyou found on the white board . Will you do me a favor and try this ? What is it ? Something Roland doodled at the home . You don 't really think Roland ... He was the only other person in the lab . Yes , but we 're talking ... about a sophisticated fuid dynamics equation . Roland barely has an l.Q of70 . You saw his facility with mathematics . Some autistic individuals display unusual abilities . Yes , but even savants ... behave only as human calculators . They can perform certain functions ... but they can 't tell the value ofanything ... or the meaning ofa number . I hate to take sides , but the bottom line is no . The terminal stroke on the six , the roofon the five ... I 'm sorry . He didn 't write it . ( gasping ) ( grunting ) ( loud music from earphones ) ( beeping ) ( door clicks ) ( screaming ) ( shattering ) ( crunching ) ( typing ) Scully : An organic object , exposed to liquid nitrogen ... will become frozen ... exhibiting great tensile strength ... but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact . Now , I 've seen this demonstrated on a fish before ... I don 't think they 'll be performing ... this experiment on Beakman 's World . Has this been dusted ? Treatyourself . Thanks . Hey , Scully , look at these files . " KMAN " must be Keats . His file was turned off at 1 2 : 31 last night . Scully : But look . Someone else entered a file ... under the name " Arthur , " after 1 2 : 31 . And worked on it for nearly five hours . Well , it couldn 't have been Keats . judging from the rigor ofthe body ... he was dead around 1 2 : 30 . You 're saying someone came in here , killed Keats ... and worked on an old Grable file ? I can 't access the Arthur file . We 're going to need the password . Try 1 5626 . How did you know that that was .. ? This is Arthur Grable 's work ... on the same fuid dynamics equations ... the others were working on . Look at all those entries . Someone has been continuing his work since he died . How did you know what the password was ? Woman : Wave good-bye . Wave good-bye . ( child crying ) Say good-bye . Bye-bye . Wave good-bye . ( door opening ) Roland ? Why did you sleep in your clothes ? Well , let 's getyou dressed . You have visitors . I 'm not supposed to talk to them . Who told you that ? Remember that talkwe had about being shy ? These are nice people , Roland . Hey , Roland , you have more shirts than I do . I think this one would look stylin ' today . What doyou think ? - The green one . - Green one ? Please . Mrs. Stodie ... can I talk toyou a second ? Seeyou later , Roland . This one ? Hereyou go . Soyou likeyourjob at the college , Roland ? Yes . I hearyou 're very good at it . Doyou remember howyou gotyourjob ? A man talked to Mrs. Stodie . What man ? Dr. Grable . Was Dr. Grable nice toyou ? Yes . When was the last time you spoke to him ? Last week ? Day before ? Dr. Grable died . I 'm sorry . Yes . People die . They go away ... and they 're not supposed to come back . Has Roland ever mentioned the name " Arthur " ? That was Dr. Grable 's first name .. but we only called him Dr. Grable . I doubt Roland even knew his first name was Arthur . Scully : Mrs. Stodie , can I get a copy ... of Roland 's file and past history ? Our histories are confidential . I understand ... but I have grounds to obtain them . The less time we spend in court ... the more time we have to help Roland . Roland Fullerwas hired byArthur Grable . He went to the halfway house ... specifically to find a mentally challenged person . Areyou suggesting ... Arthur Grable hired Roland to use him ? Areyou suggesting Arthur Grable is not dead ? Ifhe had intentions ofkilling Nollette , Keats , and Surnow ... why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect ? Yeah , but by the look ofthis , he 's hamburger . Maybe he staged it . That would explain why his work is continuing on ... six months after his death . This obituary says Arthur Grable was born in Seattle . His fatherwas a big banker . His motherwas active in a number ofcharities . Only child . Summa cum laude in physics . Doctoral and postdoctoral ... in aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd . Brilliant future , tragically cut short . Roland 's also from Seattle . He spent most ofhis life at the Heritage Halfway House . The identity ofhis parents has been sealed . There 's no information on Roland before age three ... when he was put in the program . Does it saywhen he was born ? july 1 5 , 1 952 . That 's also Arthur 's birth date . Don 'tyou wish you could fy ? I can . When I dream . People can do anything in a dream , you know . Once , one time , I had a dream we were married ... and lived in a house . Doyou have dreams , Roland ? You can tell me . Roland ? Who 's Arthur ? I 'm sorry , Roland . I 'm sorry . Roland ? Roland ? Go away ! Roland , what 's the matter ? Go away ! I don 't want to hurtyou ! Go away ! Go away . Mulder : ls thatyou ? Nollette : Yes . What 's the story here ? ( sighs ) Um ... a quantum physics professor ofmine ... at Harvey Mudd funked me . He challenged the tenets ofone ofmy theories- - a theory I later published in Nature . Anyway , to get back at him ... one afternoon , we decided to take his car apart ... and put it back together again in his office ... and left it running . An egghead classic . It was Grable 's idea . Scully : ls that Grable on the chair ? Yeah . Was he a practical joker ? Atop ofall his brilliance ... he had a genius for executing elaborate schemes . Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 l.Q .. is gaining access to and operating ... his old computer files ? Arthurwould still have to be alive . Could he have faked his own death ? No . The police report on the auto accident ... that killed Grable is woefully incomplete . A dry road surface , no mechanical problems found . The bodywas never admitted to a county morgue ... and there was no funeral . Ifyou are trying to suggest ... that Arthur Grable killed Surnow and Keats ... and is after me next , you 're way off . Art could not have done the murders . How can you be so certain ? Man : This is Arthur Grable . Because ofthe massive internal damage to his body ... caused by the car accident , we could only preserve the head . Wouldn 'tyour client find it inconvenient ... to be thawed out , only to discover ... he had no functional mobility ? We believe that , by the time science figures a way ... to revive our clients ... You 'll also know how to clone new bodies . Exactly . This technology is progressing faster ... than anyone thought possible . Ask anyone here at the university . So , while for us , the passing ofeach second ... brings our bodies closer to death ... for our clients , it brings them closer to life . These fuctuations in temperature- - Do they happen often ? No . We 've had some problems with this capsule . Our technicians have checked it ... but they 've found nothing . Could the brain cause the fuctuations ? No , but we are looking for the explanation . The patient 's in no danger . He remains perfectly preserved ... as long as there 's liquid nitrogen in the capsule . Maywe take a look at Arthur Grable 's records ? Thankyou . Dr. Barrington ... in the future , what requirements will exist ... to be an organ or tissue donor ? Same requirements as there are today . Compatible genetic makeup . It 's best ifthe donor 's related . Mulder ... Arthur Grable put down only one donor . Mulder : Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable had the same birthday . I think they 're twins . Older oryounger ? Same age ... just less hairy and with better eyesight . And the moustache ? Scully : No . Lose the whole beard . Next ? Close-cropped hair ... with a slightly receding widow 's peak . Lose the glasses . That 's Roland . Give or take a few pounds . Tell me aboutyour dreams , Roland . It 's all right . I won 't tell anybody . You know , I had a dream last night . I dreamt I was swimming in this pool ... and I could see my father underwater ... but when I dove down , the water stung my eyes . Then there was another man at the pool , watching me . He upset me . He was asking me questions I didn 't want to answer ... and I had to leave . I couldn 't find my father . I can 't tell you my dreams . Why not ? Bad . Your dreams are bad , Roland ... notyou . You 're a good person . I hit Tracy . Your dreams makeyou hit Tracy ? You know how to work this toy , Roland ? Here . You see , the wayyou work that toy ... is like what 's happening toyou . You 're the spaceship , Roland ... and your dreams are the controls . Who ... ? Who runs the controls ? Haveyou seen this man recently ? Woman : We have to say bye-bye to Roland . ( screaming ) Roland . Roland ! Roland , stop . Roland ! Roland ! Roland ? We need to keep Roland under observation . Roland ? ( glass breaking ) He 's trying to get away . Roland ! Roland ! Nollette 's gone . We should arrange a security guard to find him . No one 's going to provideyou with anything ... onceyou explain your theory ... on how Roland Fuller is capable ofthese murders . You 've got a brother , don 'tyou , Scully ? Yeah , two . Haveyou ever thought about calling one ofthem ... and then all ofa sudden , the phone rings ... and it 's one ofthem calling you ? Does this pitch end ... with a way for me to lower my long distance charges ? Evidence suggests psychic connections ... are stronger between family members . Particularly between twins that shared the same womb . Okay , but in this case ... one sibling has closer ties to a frozen Fudgsicle ... than to his own brother . Arthur Grable is not dead . He 's in a state ofconsciousness ... that no human has ever returned from . What ifthat state allows one to develop psychic ability ... beyond the potential ofthe conscious mind ? He could use that ability to control his brother ... to kill those scientists . But whywould he kill his colleagues ? That 's a question only Dr. Nollette can answer . Okay , let 's go . I have to call my brother . Mulder : We 'vegot to fiindNollette . Scully : Let 's talk to campussecurity . Wego this way ? No , wegoleft . Well , whereveryou are , Arthur ... I 'm sureyou 'll appreciate this . Arthur and Roland Grable . Born at Puget Presbyterian to Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Grable ... onjuly 1 5 , 1 952 . Arthurwas four minutes older than Roland . Identical twins . Which means they 're the result ofa single egg ... fertilized by a single sperm . I 've read studies ... which suggest that , in some cases ... the identical twin arises very early in the embryonic stage ... when a mutation in one cell is rejected by the other cells ... as foreign . So Roland 's condition is the result of ... a damaged chromosome rejected by one ofArthur 's cells ? In a way , that would explain Arthur 's genius ... and Roland 's strange mathematical gift . In a way . ( phone rings ) Agent Scully . This is Larry Barrington at the Avalon Foundation . We 've got a situation here . Uh-huh . Last night , we had a break-in at the facility . That 's right . It 's Arthur Grable 's storage unit . His internalthermostat 's been compromised . Well , is there any tissue damage ? We 're trying to assess that now . The temperature 's still rising . Something 's blocking our access to the cooling program . Someone tampered with Arthur Grable 's capsule . They 're attempting to stabilize it now . Nollette . What ? What is it ? ( alarm ringing ) " Ifl have seen further than other men ... it 's because I have stood on the shoulders ofgiants . " No . This isn 'tyours . It 's amazing . There 's this body sitting there ... in front ofme talking ... butyou 're controlling it , Arthur . You took mywork . ( snickers ) What good was yourwork going to doyou ? You died before you could finish it ... beforeyou could publish it . It was mine ! And a brilliant piece ofwork too . When I saw the writing on the white board ... I knew someone had found the key . Mach 1 5 was within our reach . Our futures were guaranteed . Ironic , isn 't it ? You did all the work ... and I get all the glory . No ! Yes . Yes , Arthur . I was here working on the intake problem ... moments away from a solution when you attacked me . Fortunately , I was carrying a gun . After the murder ofmy colleagues , who could blame me ? No . Oh , that 's interesting . ( laughs : ) I 've got it . That 's it . I 've got it ! ( groans ) Arthur ! Arthur , open the door ! Arthur ! Arthur , how doyou stop this ? ! Tell me how ! Arthur ! Wait ! Roland , we need you to help us . Please , we need you to help us ... to stop the machine . ( child crying ) Try to remember how . Roland , you 've got to help him or he 'll die . Wave good-bye , Arthur . ( screaming ) Mulder : Come on , Roland . Roland : I can 't remember ... ( yells ) Scully : He 'll be held in ... psychiatric custody for evaluation . Is he being charged with a crime ? The D.A. hasn 't made that determination yet . But we 've recommended that he be remanded toyour custody ... as soon as the court deems it appropriate . How could this happen ? Roland never exhibited anyviolent tendencies . It 's my beliefthat he wasn 't acting under his own volition . What doyou mean ? This is the work ofArthur Grable , Roland 's brother . It 's a new theory ofjet propulsion ... unfinished at the time ofhis death . In the last two weeks Roland has ... completed the calculations . How ? We 're not sure , Mrs. Stodie . All we know is that Roland ... was somehow able to finish his brother 's research . Roland ? Where areyou going ? Roland , don 't go . I have to . Okay . Bye . Tracy ... wait . Keep my stars . I loveyou . Me too .

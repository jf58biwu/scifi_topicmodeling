 [ woman ] Oh , my gosh . I can 't believe it 's the Fantastic Four ! [ man ] Hey , Torch , how about a picture ? [ second man ] Can I have your autograph ? Hey , Susie , going out for dinner 's your worst idea since you put curtains on the Fantasticar . Sorry , Ben . I was hoping it 'd break Johnny out of his funk over losing Crystal . Johnny , could I please have your autograph ? - Huh , sure . - Make it to Frankie . That 's me . Flamehead 's gotta be lower than a well-digger 's toenails when he doesn 't notice a hot tamale like that . So , Ben , how 's Alicia ? Huh ? Oh , uh , fine . Heh , heh . Hey , let 's eat . Oh , I 've been reading about you all the time . It must be incredible soaring up there in the clouds like that ! - Flying and ... - Yeah , it 's the best . Oh ... - Frankie ? What is it ? - That kiss . I feel strange . - What 'd you do to her , kid ? - I didn 't do anything . She burst into flame all on her own ! I 'm all right . I feel fine . In fact , I 've never felt better . - [ people gasp ] - [ Frankie whoops and laughs ] Flame on ! Hey , wait . Come on , Johnny . Catch me if you can . Frankie , wait ! Don 't go any higher ! What 's the matter , Johnny ? Can 't you keep up ? What ... ? Help ! - Gotcha ! - What happened ? Up this high , the atmosphere 's too thin to support your flames . And I was worried it was something serious ! Frankie , this transformation is big-time serious . Oh , sorry , Johnny . How about we fly back to Reed 's lab and let him run some tests ? And get you some fireproof clothes . Whatever you say , hot stuff ! Very good , Frankie . I think the hypnoscanner has discovered the cause of your inflammatory transmogrification . Transmoggafag ... Look , that 's just peachy , Stretcho . Now , why 's she catching ' fire ? Oh , and I also found a significant repressed memory from when you were six years old . My stepfather 's lab ! I was never supposed to go in there . [ Reed ] Oh , well , apparently you didn 't always obey . It seems your stepfather was involved in chemical research in an attempt to create an android human torch for the military . [ Thing ] Daddy 's little helper ! Uh-oh . Oh , my gosh ! She 's burning ! She 's all right , Sue . See ? Frankie wasn 't hurt . Her young mind simply blotted out the traumatic incident . Cosmic ! So somehow my body absorbed that stuff in the beaker . And contact with Johnny provided the catalyst necessary to activate the dormant molecular instability ... Come on , professor , you 're givin ' me a brainache ! You know , it 's funny , but ever since I was little I just knew I was destined for something special . Come on , Johnny ! Let 's light up the skies . Teach me some of those killer moves of yours ! Oh , my pleasure . I 'm glad Matchhead 's finally checked outta Heartbreak Hotel . Well , who knows ? We may soon be changing our name to the Fantastic Five . Oh ... I don 't know , Reed , I just hope Johnny isn 't just rebounding from one heartache to another . - Okay , I 'm ready ! - Okay , let 's light our fires ! Hey , we 're just like the song . ¶ Frankie and Johnny were ... ¶ - What 's with the light show ? - Oh ! Frankie ! No ! Bow before me ! Humble your pitiful selves before the might of Terrax ! Oh , sure , pal . Right after I 'm through curtseyin ' to Captain Kangaroo ! Careful , Ben ! Terrax is Galactus ' new herald . The one who replaced the Silver Surfer . Thor and I encountered him once before . Oh , yeah ? Well , if he 's thinkin about settin ' up my world as a smorgasbord for Mr. Purple Planet Eater . Fool ! Terrax commands all soil and rock ! Foolish striplings ! Johnny ! On your knees ! I command you ! My body courses with the power cosmic bestowed upon me by Galactus himself . Special delivery for Mr. Terrax . Holy maloney ! I grow weary of this play . Let the city entire behold my might and fear me ! It ... it can 't be . The entire island of Manhattan is rising into the air ! Form a force bubble over the entire city ! If Terrax takes it into airless space ... Here goes . Don 't know how long I can sustain it ! You see the power I command ! Now , obey me or your entire city perishes . What does one city matter , if you 've led Galactus here to devour our entire planet ? Ignorant fool ! I am the herald of Galactus no more ! In all the universe , only you four have defeated Galactus in battle . For that very reason , you must battle him again . And this time , you must end the menace of Galactus for ever . [ all gasp ] Nuts , and I wanted the weekend off . - He 's coming ! - Who 's coming ? [ Reed ] Galactus ! - How did you ... ? - I don 't know . I just felt it . Go ! Destroy the devourer of planets . Hey , when did we become hired guns for every unemployed herald in the galaxy ? Ben , we 've no choice ! Millions of lives are at stake , and Sue can 't maintain the bubble for ever ! Sue , open the bubble just enough to quickly let us through . - Galactus ! - I 've been awaiting you . Then you know we 've been sent by Terrax . Yeah , any special reason Mr. Charm out there wants to put you out to pasture ? Behold , Benjamin Grimm , the manner in which cosmic events unfolded . When the Silver Surfer broke faith with Galactus to protect that pale blue orb which is your Earth , I searched the galaxy for a herald devoid of any and all morality . I chose Tyros , a bloodthirsty tyrant on his home world . A being without morals , without guilt . I imbued Tyros with the power cosmic , thus recreating him as my new herald . Terrax . He laughed as I devoured his planet , his people , his family . Gladly did he go forth to find new life-sustaining worlds to feed my hunger . Yet Terrax was not content with the role of servant . He longed once more to be a king . However , he served me faithfully until the day he discovered Antos , a planet whose very life essence was corrupted by pollution and radioactivity . A planet seething with anti-life . Terrax sought to poison me with the negative life essence of Antos . He nearly succeeded . I was weakened , but did not die . Terrax fled to Earth to escape my wrath . Now he has sought your help in destroying me ! In my weakened state , he may well succeed . I detect no battle within Galactus ' ship . Can it be that Galactus is too weak to fight ? Then let Terrax himself finish what he has begun ! No ! Frankie ! - What are you doing ? - I couldn 't help it , Johnny . I couldn 't let him destroy Galactus . Stretch , check out the Big G. His equipment 's absorbing Terrax 's energy . Every time Terrax uses his power , he makes Galactus stronger ! So that 's why Wing-hat 's kept us alive up here , to sucker Terrax into a fight . - Which means ... - I know what it means . It 's clobberin ' time ! Enough ! No ! You are weak ... Dying ! Insolent worm ! Have you not yet learned who is master and who is slave ? The power cosmic is mine to bestow . And mine to reclaim ! No ! No ! No ! Terrax is no more ! What a revoltin ' development this is . Kinda puts me in the mood for some fishin ' , though ! In gratitude for your aid , Reed Richards , I now undo that which Terrax has done . - Sue ! Darling ! - I 'm all right . The scale is again in balance . All is as it was . What is it ? What 's wrong ? The poison of Antos . Its dark venom overtakes me sooner than I had expected . To survive , Galactus must feed now . And upon your Earth ! Aunt Petunia 's favorite nephew ain 't gonna just sit around on his dainty orange patootie while Old Square Eyes turns planet Earth into a blue-plate special ! Hey ! Stinkin ' ingrate ! We saved you ! Galactus , I beg you . Stop in the name of humanity . What knows Galactus of humanity ? I do what I must . And so do I , you helmet-headed heel . Galactus is just doing what he must to survive . Reed , look ! It 's Thor ! Stay thy hand , villain ! I command thee halt ! Hey , Goldilocks is hogging ' all the fun ! Flame on ! C 'mon , Frankie ! Let 's get him ! I ... I ... No ! - Uh ... - I don 't believe it ! Johnny , he 's still alive . We must keep him away from his converter . Even weakened , Galactus is infinitely more than a match for us . [ male voice ] Hear me , Galactus . Holy smoke ! Am I missin ' something ? Is everybody around here on fire but me ? They call me Ghost Rider . I am summoned when innocent blood is shed . And you have shed much innocent blood . [ Johnny ] Ghost Rider . I thought he was a myth ! Who called him ? When did this become a superhero convention ? Do you dare face the agony of those you have slain ? Mortal or demon , whichever you be , begone ! Galactus has no time for games ! This is no game ! No ! Feel the torment of a billion billion extinguished souls . Experience the pain of eternal guilt . - No ! - [ wailing ] Oh ... My task is complete . I leave you now , Galactus , in mortal hands ! I gotta lay off Aunt Petunia 's pink lemonade . Reed ! Is it my imagination or is Galactus starting to shrink ? The giant doth feed upon his own body to survive . Then it 's finally happened . Galactus is dying . No ! You have to save him ! Galactus isn 't evil . He simply is what he is . A force of nature . And he deserves your help as much as any living creature . You 're right , Frankie . Galactus must live . Aw , my sweet bunions . This superhero stuff gets more complicated every day . If such is your decisión , Reed Richards , Thor will not question it . Let the power of my enchanted hammer sustain the giant whilst you ponder this dilemma ! Well , I have monitored several uninhabited planets in the Lambda Sector with the life essence Galactus needs . But I 've no way to pinpoint their exact location . And Galactus no longer has a herald to search them out . Then there 's only one solution . Mighty Galactus , spare the Earth and I will become your new herald . [ Johnny ] Frankie , no ! Do you realize what you 're saying ? - I do . - But what about ... us ? Don 't you see , Johnny ? Your destiny is with Crystal . You must know that . Mine is with Galactus . Somehow , I 've always known it deep in my soul . My herald . Stand back . He hath absorbed energy anew . Let the power cosmic join with your own . Behold Nova , Herald to Galactus ! Frankie ! Frankie , wait ! Turn back , Johnny Storm . Where I go , you may not follow . I 'm free ! Free ! I 'm free ! [ laughs ] Wait ! Air 's too thin ... Goodbye , Frankie . Reed Richards , you saved my life when it would have been far easier to do otherwise . For this act , Galactus willingly renews his pledge to spare your planet . Perhaps here , as nowhere else in the limitless cosmos , Galactus has found those he might dare name ... friends .

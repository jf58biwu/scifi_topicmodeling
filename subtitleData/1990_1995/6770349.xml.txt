 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . Gee , Sikes , if I 'd have known you had money ... I would have taken your marriage proposals much more serious . Matthew proposed to you ? Only in her dreams . Come on , Sikes , I 've known you what , five years ? The only resort you could ever afford was bank account falls . Hey , the trip 's free , I won it . He cheated . I was in the right place at the right time . I won it fair and square . Claiming Leo Bavaqua 's prize is hardly " fair and square . " Leo Bavaqua ? Yeah , the guy who used to live in my apartment . Big deal . It was still my address . But it said " Leo Bavaqua . " Look , he didn 't leave a forwarding address , I figure old Leo wants me to have it . Hey , Leo 's better off . I 've been to Honolulu , Sikes , I know . Okay , while you 're stuck partnering with Honest Abe ... I 'll be fancy-free in Waikiki . MATT : ( SINGING ) Aloha ... Hello . Lois , I thought ghouls only came out at night . They put you on day , didn 't they ? Hi . I 'm Lois Allen . Zepeda . She just made detective . Guess they lowered the standards . She 'll be working with George on this one while I 'm gone . MATT : What do we got ? LOIS : In a word , bizarre . LOIS : The head wound is the culprit , it looks like a .38 . It was pinned to the body . It 's written on a medical prescription form . It 's a real piece of literature . " Take two aspirin and call me in hell . " GEORGE : Do you think she was killed here ? That 's my guess , and not long ago . I 'll have the results to you tomorrow . Don 't look now , but there 's the two-headed-baby reporter . I hate that guy . And the rag he works for . Anything good happen over here ? He makes all cops sound like clowns . Surprised to see you here , Burns . Didn 't know slime could run uphill . What 's this I hear about a psychotic note ? Must have been reading your own paper . How about a little peek ? Wrong . Come on , Sikes , don 't be a stickler . Rules are meant to be broken . Funny , that 's what I think about your neck . What 's this here ? Real mature , Sikes . SUSAN : How 's it going ? GEORGE : All right . Mom , can I go to the mall with Cyndy after school on Thursday ? I don 't see why not , as long as you 've done all your chores . Great . The new leather store , it 's giving away friendship bracelets . Buck , it must be sturdy . I think this sporot could hold a dozen zepno players ... carrying full neelexea . Let alone little Vessna in a half-hour ceremony . Buck , you better take her off the oscillator , she 's had plenty today . You will have a great moocteebuti . I tried to explain to my teacher about the ceremony . She said it sounded like what humans call a christening . It is , except moocteebuti not only embraces ... the new life into the arms of Andarko and Celine ... but into the hearts of the family , too . Albert , thank you for coming over this evening . Trying to plan the ceremony with our schedules has been very difficult . Watching the young one being embraced into the family ... is one of the good things of being a Binnaum . Now , the gifts that you give her are symbolic ... of what you are responsible for teaching her . I should have the vessel of Celine ready for the gift offerings . What did you each choose ? I picked tradition . I have chosen love . I 've chosen spirituality ... which leaves the gift of honor to you , Em . Emily , do you understand your responsibility ? I guess . Em , this is tradition . Don 't guess , know . GEORGE : Buck . If you follow what the writings of Celine tell us to do ... Vessna will enjoy good health . Don 't worry , Albert , we 'll all follow the rules . Remember , by sundown on the days leading up to the ceremony ... everyone takes a turn putting a gift of their love ... into the vessel of Celine . It 's very important . Macadamia nuts , Zepeda ? Yeah , Sikes , about the size of your brain . Like that . ZEPEDA : Break them open . Come on . MATT : I 'll pass the honors . George ? ( ALL LAUGHING ) This is comedy , yes ? Funny , huh ? Oh , yes . Matt , I ... For you . What 's this , a pet rock ? You do know funny . No , Matthew , it 's a Tenctonese journey stone . It 's supposed to bring good fortune to the traveler . Thanks , George , I 'll get it a tan . All right , people , enough frivolity . Let 's all get back to work . Yeah , you 're right , Bry , party 's over . Boot . Listen , you guys . Hey , thanks a lot . This means a lot to me , I 'm deeply and profoundly moved . While I 'm in Hawaii , I won 't be thinking of you at all . The coroner 's report ? Yesterday 's victim . She was a school teacher from Pasadena . Gunshot wound was the cause of death ... there was also a large amount of sodium pentothal ... injected into her system . ZEPEDA : Sodium pentothal , that 's bizarre . What is it , Matt ? Nothing . Sodium pentothal is an anesthetic . It 's also used as a truth serum , as well . ZEPEDA : Yeah . Hi , Albert . Hello . What do you suppose they 're talking about in there ? Wouldn 't have anything to do with the killer 's note , would it ? I don 't know . What , are you forgetting your civics class ? I 'm the press . I represent the people . The people have a right to know . That 's true , but the last time ... Yeah , but look , have one of these on me . Sometimes ... we react badly to tobacco . These are mild . Go ahead . Like this . Yeah . These health nuts can drive you crazy , huh ? A man enjoys a good cigarette every now and then . Especially after you-know-what . Albert , just between you and me , where are they keeping that note ? What ? Albert ? Albert , you all right ? I 'm fine . I don 't think I 'll have any more . OFFICER : There you go . ( CAMERA CLICKING ) George and Zepeda can track the victim . You know , history , relationships , personal stuff . I 'll work from the killer 's side ... where the sodium pentothal could 've been bought ... Sikes , what about Hawaii ? It 's not going anywhere . This is too important , I want in . Matthew , Beatrice and I are perfectly prepared to handle this case . You should have your vacation . I will , George , when this is done . Reservations are made to be broken , right ? Okay , Sikes , it 's your life . I thought you were looking forward to your vacation , Matthew . Or has your guilty conscience finally caught up with you ? I don 't wanna leave you guys in the lurch . The lurch ? I don 't get you , Sikes . I mean , whatever happened to cold beer and warm ocean breezes ? Zepeda , you walked the beat for 10 years . Since when 've you got something against an honest day 's work ? Look , I 'm sorry . I gotta check some things out . I 'll see you later . How the hell did Burns get this note ? GEORGE : We don 't know . " Doctor of Death . " He 's given the nutcase a reputation to live up to . What do you mean ? Look at all the other butchers we 've had in LA . They love to play the part . The Hillside Strangler , The Night Stalker , the Skid Row Slasher . Even one of your own , George . The Slagtown Slaughterer , remember ? I will never forget it . Neither will I , George . We can 't be sure this Doctor of Death will kill again . We can 't be sure he won 't , either . Someone claiming to be the Doctor of Death just gave me ... an address where we could find his latest patient . Anybody here ? It 's me , Burns . I got your message . ( BURNS GASPS ) That 'll be fine . Thanks for all your help , Officer . Just wait here . " There is truth in death . " He 's following the Gospel According to Burns . Look how he signed it : " The Doctor of Death . " We 're dealing with a very dangerous mind . Which one , the killer 's or Burns ' ? Don 't take this the wrong way , Sikes ... but it doesn 't look like you can leave for Hawaii soon enough . Any pertinent findings , Dr. Allen ? I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings , gentlemen , but I 'm afraid ... we definitely have a multiple killer on our hands . Are we certain it 's not a copycat ? Very . Both victims were injected with large doses of sodium pentothal ... with identical hypodermic needles . And after further testing ... I also found the presence of identical cellulose fibers ... near the point of injection . Other than that , both bodies are clean . I 'm afraid that 's all I have for you now . Thank you , Lois . Let 's have SID run some tests on those fibers . See if we can track them down . There 's gotta be a lead in there somewhere . Sell many papers this morning , Burns ? What do you care , Sikes ? They 're for people who read . He tipped you off , didn 't he ? That psycho told you where the body would be . As a member of the fourth estate ... I 'm not allowed to divulge any information about my sources . I got a source for you . Matthew . I didn 't do nothing wrong . Yeah , you took evidence from a police investigation . I took a picture . The people got a right to know . I was just doing my job . Yeah , well , the job you 're doing is egging on a nutcase . And it 's my job to stop him . Guess that kind of puts us on different sides of the fence , don 't it ? Doesn 't this look like a fun bunch ? While we 're young , Zepeda . All right , look , maybe something , maybe nothing . But this woman just called . She just read Burns ' story ... and it sparked her on something she saw . I guess she saw a strange truck parked where victim number two was found . They get a plate ? Yeah . It 's a stolen truck , registered to a Star Tool Die company . Let 's go . See , Sikes ? What I do is good for you guys . Maybe we are on the same side of the fence , after all . Sorry about the hard hat , but rules is rules . I 'm just following direction . Mr. Groves , I 've been directed to ask you about one of your workers , Brian Knott . He don 't follow direction . And he took my truck . Anyway , he 's been working here , if you wanna call it that ... about two weeks , delivery stuff . But he ain 't showed up for work in the last four days . No call , no nothing ? Got no phone , is my bet . I 'm telling you , Knott is as odd as a three-legged duck . Spooky , I 'd say . And , like I said , he 's got one of my trucks . I filed a complaint . You got any word on that ? There is an APB out on it . If it 's found , you 'll be notified . Do you know where this man lives ? I dug out his employment history , what little there is . Never did give an address , though . What does this Brian Knott look like ? About 35 , I 'd say . Not short , not tall ... blond hair , blue eyes . Course , his are kind of crazy . Does he have any distinguishing marks , like maybe a scar ? Yeah , he has a scar over his right eyebrow . You find him . Get my truck back . Don 't worry , we 'll find him . Matt , when you asked about the scar , it was as if you knew he had one . A lot of people have scars , George . Yes , Matt , but what I mean is ... Look , I 've been a cop a lot longer than you have . I may not have the alien senses , but I 've got instincts of my own . This is kind of dumb . I mean , I can 't even think of a gift ... to put in the vessel for Vessna 's moocteebuti . According to the writings of Celine , Em , listen to your hearts ... then physicalize that emotion with something symbolic . What does that mean ? It means what it means . Thanks a lot , Buck . Just remember , Em , sundown is your deadline . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Cyndy . Hi . My mom 's waiting in the car to take us to the mall . Are you ready ? How are you , Cyndy ? Fine , thanks . They 're gonna give out all the friendship bracelets , if we don 't go now . Can I go , Mom ? Have you done all your chores ? Everything you were supposed to do ? Yeah , Mom , I 've done everything . Come on , Em . Well , then , have fun , as long as you 're home by 8 : 00 . But , Mom , I ... It 's a school night . Thanks . Bogus , the guy 's employment records . It 's a dry hole . And I 'm having no luck connecting the two victims . The woman is a teacher from Pasadena . The man , a carpenter from Orange . Keep digging . There 's gotta be something . Something ? I got 12 hours of nothing , but I did trace the prescription pad ... the doctor used to make his notes up to Edmonton , Canada . But , you see , the Mounties have to get back to me ... with those sodium pentothal similars . Then run it in the national computers . Run it through Interpol . Tomorrow , Sikes . I 'm cooked . Great . The guy 's leaving a trail of bodies , and you 're tired ? It 's late . I have to get home to Vessna . We 'll make a fresh start in the morning . You look as though you could use some rest as well , Matt . I 'm fine . Matt , what 's wrong ? Nothing . Ever since you cancelled your trip to Hawaii ... you 've become very distant . Now , I may not have been a cop as long as you ... but it doesn 't take a Sherwood Holmes to realize something 's troubling you . What 's troubling me , Sherlock ... is there 's a psycho out there killing people . Now , if you guys wanna go home , go home . I 'm gonna stop him . Matt . Goodbye , George . ( MACHINE BEEPING ERRATICALLY ) WOMAN : ( VOICEOVER ) Please , don 't . ( SOBBING ) No ! MAN : ( VOICEOVER ) Looks like you 're the one who 's gonna drop it . Or I drop her . WOMAN : ( SOBBING ) God , help me . Please ! MATT : ( VOICEOVER ) Let her go ! MAN : Come on , hero . Toss it away . We all walk out of here , nice-like . MATT : ( VOICEOVER ) No deal . MAN : Come on , cop . You shoot me ... MAN : and I even jerk , she 's dead . WOMAN : No ! MAN : Now , toss it away ! MAN : ( ECHOING ) What 's it gonna be ? ( PHONE RINGING ) Yeah , this is Burns . Hi , Headline , what 's news ? Who 's this ? I 'm insulted you had to ask . I 'm the one that sent you the address that got you an exclusive . It 's the Doctor . How 'd you get my number ? Well , that doesn 't matter . What does matter is what I 've got planned for tonight . If you thought the last one was good , be at the corner of 11th and Hill ... 9 : 00 p.m. Point your camera north . You might just wind up with a prizewinner . Yeah , I hear you . Why ... ( DIAL TONE RINGING ) ( MAN GRUNTING ) ( MAN SCREAMING ) No , I 'm not saying I ain 't interested . I 'm just saying I got better offers for the exclusive movie and TV rights . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Yeah , whoever it is , just leave it outside . I 'm on the horn . Yeah , so what 've you got to offer me to make me more interested ? Sikes . What are you , crazy ? You 're the expert on crazy , Burns . I 'm on the phone . Get lost . You were on the phone , now you 're under arrest . Arrest ? You are nuts . You think I 'm nuts , Burns ? Come on , Sikes ... you think I 'm as nuts as your buddy , Doctor Death ? 'Cause he 'd pull the trigger . You 're gonna hear from my lawyer . Yeah ? Good . Maybe he can explain how you can let an innocent man die ... so you can sell more papers . Man , I didn 't know this was gonna happen . You knew something was gonna happen . You were there with a camera . You could have stopped it . What could I have done ? You could have called . You could have done something , anything . But you took pictures . Like I told you , I got a right to report the news . Yeah , you 're not reporting it anymore , pal , you 're creating it . You 're a participant . And you 're under arrest for accessory to murder . Man , come on , you can 't do this to me . Let me go . Let him go . You heard me , Sikes , let him go . Come on , Grazer . Look , I know what he did . But there 's a thing in this country called a constitution . Yeah . And , unfortunately , it gives him the right . Yeah , I got an obligation to the public . What about your obligation as a human being , slime ? Sikes , Burns ' paper , if you can call it that ... just marched an army of lawyers into the commissioner 's office . Matthew . The call to release Burns is his , not mine . I don 't give a damn what the commissioner says . Another innocent victim is dead ... and I 'm not gonna let him fuel the fire anymore . Book him . Get out of here , Burns . What ? You heard me . It 's about time . You better get new locks on your doors , Burns ... 'cause whether you know it or not , you and the Doc are in bed now . GEORGE : Matthew . MATT : You 're his eyes , his ears . Every time he kills , you 're right there with him . With the printed words . Sikes , that 's enough . Don 't be surprised if that army of lawyers returns to the front . This time with a lawsuit . Sikes , I need to see you in my office . Look , we know this guy 's a random killer , there 's no predicting it . So , the way to nail him is to trail his bait . Burns . I doubt Burns will cooperate . The hell with cooperation . We tap his phone , we read his mail , we watch his every move . Sooner or later , the Doctor 's gonna make a house call . You know as well as I do that with all the recent press harassment cases ... the warrants will be impossible to get . To hell with the warrants ! Do we wanna nail this guy , or don 't we ? There 's a flight leaving for Honolulu within the hour . I 'm booking you on it . So you 're a travel agent now ? Francisco will drive you to the airport . What ? We 've settled this all without me ? Matt , we thought it best . Look , I can 't go . This case ... This case will be handled by Francisco and Zepeda , as originally planned . You need the R and R. I feel fine . Matt , look at yourself . Sikes . Matt , I know we hardly ever see eye to eye ... but trust me on this one . A few days in Hawaii would do you a world of good . You 've been worrying around the clock for days . ZEPEDA : You 're a good cop , Sikes , but we all get toasted . Maybe you guys are right . BUCK : These fumes aren 't helping much , Mom . Vessna 's still wheezing . SUSAN : Chop the pine needles finer ... the tar mustn 't be viscous enough . This old Tenctonese remedy should work . BUCK : I 'm so glad you came home , Mom . I mean , Vessna was breathing fine this morning . I don 't know what could have caused this . I 've never seen this before ... but this is the first baby we 've had on this planet . It could be anything . ( VESSNA CRYING ) Hey , spaceman , did you get Sikes off ? Yes , I put him on the bullet plane about an hour ago . He should be there by now . Sleema . I do hope he has fun . I 've never seen him look so troubled before . ZEPEDA : Sikes ' desk is a regular junk-food store . You still worried about Sikes , spaceman ? Forget it . By now , he 's fancy-free in Waikiki . OFFICER : ( VOICEOVER ) Sikes , I 'm hit ! I 'm hit ! I 'm all right , man , I 'm all right . He 's gone upstairs , call for backup . There 's no time , he 's mine . Sikes ! WOMAN : ( SOBBING ) Please ! Please , don 't ! Drop it , police ! No ! DOCTOR : Looks like you 're the one who 's gonna drop it . Or I drop her . God , help me . Please . Let her go ! Come on , hero . Toss it away . We all walk out of here , nice-like . No deal . You shoot me , and I even jerk , she 's dead . Now , toss it away ! What 's it gonna be ? Okay . Let her go . No ! ( MACHINE BEEPING ) ( PHONE RINGING ) WOMAN : Cloverleaf Liquor . Yeah , this is Burns , over in Redondo . Yeah , Mr. Burns , what can I do for you ? BURNS : Yeah , would you send me up the usual ? A fifth of generic scotch and a tuna sandwich . But his plane landed two hours ago . He should have checked in by now . Yes , please check again . I 'll hold . We 're still coming up empty on that APB on the pickup . But listen to this , spaceman . SID ran a check on those cellulose fibers found on the guy that did the swan dive . Same kind used in newsprint back in the ' 80s . Only five places in the city used it . I 'll check on it . Hey . The best info comes from Edmonton , Canada . Ten years ago , they had a similar string of murders . So I ran that and all our information through Interpol ... for the last eight years , that same guy has been ... in a half dozen cities between Glasgow and Perth . And sodium pentothal was in each of the victim 's bodies ? Yep , in each case . Yes , I 'm still here . Thank you for your help . What ? Matthew never went to Hawaii . ( PHONE RINGING ) This is Burns . Hey , Headline , we 're looking good . DOCTOR : You know , I 've been thinking ... what we need now is an up-close-and-personal . Up-close-and-personal ? Yeah , you know , Headline , one of those ... " You 've seen his work , now meet the man ... " kind of profile . DOCTOR : An exclusive interview , just you and me , tonight . Sure . 9 : 00 p.m. South dome . The old McClure building . Gotcha ! I 'm Burns . Relax , Headline . We 're partners , you and me . I 've been listening to the ship 's horns calling me in the night . It 's time to move on . DOCTOR : But I wanted my mission to be known before I went . BURNS : Yeah . What is your mission ? This world is sickened . So shots of sodium pentothal gonna cure this ? I 'm a messenger , and my medicine is the truth . You 're killing people . Exactly ! DOCTOR : This life is a lie , and the only way to escape the lie ... is to reach that eternal truth which is death . And I help people to find that truth . Yeah ? How do you know this truth ? By tasting death , I live life . I help people to find the truth . And it 's your mission to help me spread the truth before I go . ( CANS RATTLING ) I trusted you . I didn 't do it ! I didn 't do it ! Freeze , police ! ( MATT GRUNTS ) ( MATT GROANS ) She 's breathing much more easily now . She 'll be fine . Our love protects her . Emily . What are you doing up ? It 's my fault . It 's my fault she 's sick . Emily ? I lied . I didn 't keep my word to Celine . I didn 't put my offering in the vessel ... and now she 's punishing me by cursing Vessna with sickness . You didn 't give your offering ? Emily . I know how hard it must be for you to come to us with this . We appreciate your honesty , Em . But I lied to Celine . Celine is all-forgiving . I am sure she will look upon your words in the same light as well . Emily ... the moocteebuti ritual is a way for all of us ... not just Vessna , to learn about life 's passages . The vessel is symbolic of that learning . By giving Vessna love , we get love in return . I think ... that if you give Vessna an offering from your hearts ... it will make her very happy . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Dad . I 'll get it . Matthew . I blew it , man . I had him , and I blew it . And now he 's got Burns . I blew it . Checking up on me ? I needed to know why . Matthew Sikes . Breaks the cardinal cop rule , puts his weapon down ... gives it up ... and what does he get ? A killer gets away , and every person who 's died since can thank me for it . You got to stop blaming yourself . Yeah , right . It was not your fault . Tell that to his victims . Tell that to a 22-year-old nurse I watched die . Her name was Adell ... Adell Alynn Addison . She grew up in Long Beach ... always wanted to be a nurse ... wanted to help people . She ... always brought daisies to her patients . Made them feel better . She would have been 30 this June 21 . That 's the longest day of the year , June 21 , it 's ... It 's the longest day . You were a young cop . You made a mistake . You 've got to forgive yourself or you 'll never make up for it . I 'm not a young cop anymore ... and I blew it tonight . He got away again , and now he 's leaving town . Then let 's go stop him . Find him . Do you think he 's killed Burns ? No . The nutcase thinks Burns printing his words to the world ... is part of his mission in this life or some kind of garbage . He ain 't gonna hurt him till that word gets printed . Damn it , George , the answer 's got to be right here . All right . We know he 's killed in Canada and Australia ... all over the world . And now he 's back in LA . The only trail he 's left is the sodium pentothal . So random . What about the cellulose fibers found on all the victims ? They 're from newsprint . Zepeda 's narrowed down the locations where that fiber can be found . Here , see ? There are five places in the city , in all . Unfortunately , they 're too spread out for the two of us to check . The Valley , the wharf . What ? Maybe he did leave a trail . He said he heard sounds of ship horns . The water . Harbor Gazette , it 's abandoned . It 's the only one even close to the water . It 's all we got . Bingo . Matt . Let 's go . Wait . This is 1-William-1-52 . Request backup at the old Harbor Gazette building ... 3275 Dock Point Road , possible 1-55-P in progress . Now , let 's go . MATT : I can 't see a thing . GEORGE : Take my hand . MATT : ( WHISPERING ) Watch for jingle wire . GEORGE : ( WHISPERING ) Right . I 'm okay . Matt . Time is right for the word to be spread . I ... I need my own typewriter , you understand . I understand only the word . I want your word to get out , too . But I gotta do it in the newsroom ... or my editor , he 's not ... Type ! He 's not gonna publish it . He 's gonna publish it . If I have to tape it on your chest and blow your brains out ... he 's gonna publish it . Okay , Headline ... where shall we start ? I 'll flush him out . You go get Burns . The voiceless one first spoke to me as a child . He told me the truth and he told me to spread it . ( BANGING ) Keep typing . Get out the back door and down the stairs now ! Move and you 're dead . Drop it . We meet again . The circle is complete . You looked better in uniform . It 's all over this time . I 'm out of here or he learns the truth . Drop the gun . I 've seen how you keep your word . Drop the gun . If you shoot me , hero , and I even jerk , he 's dead . Now drop the gun . I said drop it ! Maybe you won 't jerk . ( GRUNTS ) ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) It 's all over . MATT : Call the coroner . OFFICER : I 'll call it in . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . He would 've killed you . I knew you wouldn 't let him . In your life , I shall be the one who teaches you ... about loving others , as you love your universe . In your life , I shall be the one who teaches you ... about the journey and sacrifice of Andarko and Celine . In your life , I shall be the one who teaches you ... of your past as a Tenctonese . In your life , I shall be the one who teaches you ... the importance of being honest . Milo . Vessna , in your life ... I 'll be the one who teaches you how special your father is . In your life , we shall love and teach you .

 After the first atomic bomb , Einstein said ... " If I had known where this would lead , I 'd have been a watchmaker . " So , here I am either at the end of a world or the beginning of one . A record must be kept for the sanity of all concerned . I 'll start from when the time slips werejust beginning . Power , gentlemen . Power enough to run the world or destroy it . Most of all , you 've got to control it . That 's where I come in . Status ? D.D.Q. On 12 . All systems go . Ladies and gentlemen ... I give you the atom - new and improved . Power level - 75 . Climbing . Eighty-four , 89 , 93 , 96 ... 96.5 , 97.7 ... 98 . 1 , 98.5 , 98.9 - It worked ! A weapon . A weapon beyond your wildest imagination , General . A particle beam that simply makes the enemy disappear . Project Safe World can give your armed forces the power of a black hole . What the hell was that ? Some negligible atmospheric vibration , huh ? - Barely measurable . - Will they fund the next step ? Time out , Doc . In the three months since you 've been testing this thing we 've had freak weather , people disappearing and these time slips . I 'm sorry , but we have a very public crisis brewing here . All right , so we have a side effect to contend with . It 's not the end of the world . The president is getting a sore throat from denying any knowledge of this program . Joe , I 've gotta tell him something . Yes , well , tell him when we implode an object it slips out of time . And right now , when it goes , it sort of leaves a door open . What you 're trying to say is that you seriously screwed up . He wanted a weapon . He 's got a weapon . We got work to do . Well ? He didn 't go for it . Joe , it 's not over . - There 's still time . - The cloud 's building again , Joe . I wanted to create a weapon that wouldn 't destroy the world . And look what I did . Is it reversible ? Oh , my God , I hope so . It needs more work . I 'll need the prototype laser tonight . Good afternoon , Dr. Buchanan . Would you like me to drive ? No . I 'm feeling energetic . I 'll drive . Death and damage attributed to this phenomenon . There is still no statement from the Pentagon . And today , White House spokesperson Mary Ann Sutter again denied any connection between these severe stratospheric disturbances - ... apparent slips in time - ... and recent weapons testing at the Hawkings Institute in California . In other news , a tribute will be held tomorrow for the last remaining part of the Brazilian rain forest . I am tracking intruders on your property . Shall I call security ? Don 't worry , baby . It 's just neighborhood children . Very good . What goes around comes around . - * * - What have we here ? - Is it dead ? - It died this morning . - How do you know it 's dead ? - She got a new one . Ah ! Progress . Secular seculorum . - " Finiculi , Finicula . " - " Que Sera , Sera . " Farewell , old bike . There 's a storm coming , kids . Let 's get inside . I said , come on ! Kids , come on ! - Come on ! Leave the bike ! - No ! Come on here . Zero pollution . Maximum ozone shield . Something tells me we 're not in New Los Angeles anymore . Access mainframe . I am sorry , Dr. Buchanan . The central computer at Hawkings Institute does not respond . Access mainframe through uplink Tyco orbiter . The Tyco orbiter is not in position . Uplink any available satellite . Tracking . There are no satellites . Access television . Not even any radio ? We are alone , Doctor . Jesus H. Christ ! Where am I ? No record of a middle initial for a Jesus Christ , Dr. Buchanan . Very funny . Come on . In . Scientifically speaking , we are out in the sticks . * * - What place is this ? - The Inn at Secheron . - How may I help you ? - Well , I would like to eat . I can give you venison at two francs or trout at three and five . Ah . Tell me what would you give me ... for this ? Fifty francs , Swiss . Fifty , plus the trout . Done . Take a seat . Mind if I join you ? Can 't stop you from sitting down . Tell me , is your attire the result of Napoleon 's defeat or have you been abandoned by a circus ? Where I come from , this is considered an appropriate fashion . I 'm from America . Ah , yes . America . Dr. Joseph Buchanan . I am also a doctor . But why do you come to Secheron and deny yourself the culture of Geneva ? Well , I enjoy the distractions of country life . I scorn distraction . There 's too much work to be done . - Is that a timepiece ? - Yes . May I see it ? No hands . The digits change shape . Are they filled with mercury ? How do you wind it ? I don 't . It runs on electricity . Electricity ? But it 's so small . I just want you to know , sir that we 're all praying for you and your family . - Thank you . - You brother was such a sweet boy . May the witch who killed him burn in hell . Yes , yes . I must go . Perhaps we can discuss electricity another time . - I would like that . - Oh , yes . I would like that too , Doctor - Frankenstein . Are you not well , sir ? Yes , I 've - I 've heard of your work . You 're mistaken , sir . My work is quite unknown . Marie , get the doctor 's bag . Thank you . - Drive . - Come on ! Come on ! Driver , stop ahead ! Give me what I want ! No ! Go ! Come no more , you damn beast ! Who is responsible for this ? Who do you think ? Go ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! - Good morning , Dr. Buchanan . - Power on . Manual drive . Manual drive is commencing now . Supposition . One : We 've suffered a time slip . Two : The time slip phenomenon 's related to implosion experiments . What is the probability of reversing time slip using prototype laser projector ? That is an interesting question . Without access to the mainframe , I will need approximately 96 hours . - Go to work . - Yes , Dr. Buchanan . My sensors indicate we are near an urban center . Any instructions ? - Be a good girl . - My options are limited . - Fill it all the way to the top . - Yes , sir . Order . Order , please ! The overwhelming evidence presented today will prove thatJustine Moritz did brazenly commit this most vile crime this unforgivable act against the people of Geneva and , my friends , against all mankind . Excuse me , Reverend . Are the seats next to the young lady over there open to the public ? Obviously , good sir , you are a stranger here . Sorry . I don 't understand . That is Lord Byron 's mistress . The Lord Byron lives here in Geneva ? Across the lake in sin with the poet Shelley and Mary Godwin . - You mean Mary Shelley . - They are not married . Perhaps not . But she 's a great writer . Excuse me . A giant , you say ? Well , the tallest man I ever seen , sir . And yet , you saw him only at night ? Yes , sir . But his footprints went all over my field come morning . - I dug one up to show you , sir . - Here 's your box , sir . Raise it . Show the court . Your Honor , that was the footprint of the beast what killed my sheep . I swear it ! I 've seen it with my own eyes ! Now , what if it was the same brute what killed the little boy ? Well , how do you suppose I lost the sheep ? Huh ? How do you suppose I got this gash on my forehead ? Spirits . Next witness . Your Honor , Justine Moritz is an innocent child . - Sir , you 've had your say . - She 's innocent as the blessed virgin . Forgive me , Miss Godwin . The young girl over there , is she the one on trial ? Yes . She 's accused of killing William Frankenstein , who was six . She lacks the physical strength necessary to commit the crime as described so , of course , she 's accused of witchcraft . It is a travesty . Yes , but excellent material for a book , I suppose . - What do you mean , sir ? - My name is Joseph Buchanan . I 'm a great admirer of your work , Miss Godwin . You must be confusing me with someone else , Mr. Buchanan . I 've never been published . Can you identify this ? It 's the locket ... that belonged to William . Can you explain how this charm came to be amongst your belongings ? When I awoke ... I found it . The truth is you took it after killing William Frankenstein after breaking his neck and wrenching his arm from his body ! Come , girl ! Admit it , and allow yourself the mercy of God 's forgiveness . No ! No ! L - I didn 't do it ! Excuse me . Now , as to the charge of witchcraft - Your Honor , we find Justine Moritz guilty of the murder of William Frankenstein . Justine Moritz , you have heard the verdict . You are hereby sentenced to hang by the neck till dead . Execution is scheduled for tomorrow at noon . Poor kid . Victor , I beg you not to go . Where are you ? I know you have returned . Reveal yourself . Who are you ? Give me what you promised , or I will break him , Victor ! I will crush everyone around you ! Then I will crush you . You made me . Now you would destroy me . Why ? - You murdered my brother . - Mur-dered ? You stopped his life ! He was easily crushed . You should have made him strong , Victor , like me . I did not make William . No ? Then ... who did ? He was born of woman , you monstrous wretch . I did not ask to be made monstrous ! I am alone and miserable . Make me a mate as you promised . Make me a mate , and you will never see me again . I will never make another like you . Make me a mate or I will murder Elizabeth . Victor ! Why are you following me ? Are you from the court ? I told you , I am a doctor . I know of your discovery . I know that you put life into that creature , and I know that he is killing . I wanted to give man the power to create life to free him from a cruel and fictitious god . What man ever achieved that ? Scientists have made far greater monsters than yours , Victor . Tell the truth . Show the world what you have created . Impossible . I 've created an abomination . What aboutJustine ? Who will free her from the mob ? You cannot let her pay for your sins . What sins ? I 'm a scientist . I cannot sin . She must die . The truth is too unbearable . If you want to ease your conscience about William , then help the girl . If they kill her , how will you live with yourself after that ? I don 't know . Help the girl , Victor . Continuous fow of ink contained in barrel . Remarkable . Did you make it clear that the girl is innocent ? - And you simply lick this ? - Yes . It tastes like - Peppermint . Victor , the girl . Yes , certainly . The girl is innocent . Good . Then I shall take this letter in the morning and deliver it to the judge in person . No , not the judge . You must deliver it to my fiancée , Elizabeth . She 's of good family , and thejudge will listen to her . You are truly a marvel , Buchanan . This electric carriage - You have mastered thermodynamics geomagnetism , secrets of the universe . Where do you come from ? The Moon ? Mount Olympus ? I live in the same world you live in . Yes , truly . The world of science . We are brothers , Doctor . - Who made you ? - Who are you ? Who made you ? Did Victor make you ? Help ! Help ! Back to the gate , boys ! Stop that ! Stop ... That ! Stop that . Frankenstein villa ? Is Elizabeth here ? If you mean Miss Levenza , she does not live in this house . Victor assures me that she is here . I have an urgent letter for her . Ah , ah ! Victor asked me to deliver it to her in person . Thank you . Stay . I will inform Miss Levenza you are here . God disapproves of the eavesdropper , sir , as do I. Won 't you come in ? I cannot say that I am grateful , sir but I do thank you for your trouble . - Allow me to escort you to the judge . - But what do you mean by that ? Well , they 're going to hang Justine Moritz at noon . I 'm afraid no one could prove her innocence . But the letter explains her innocence . There is nothing here aboutJustine . Victor warns me that I must leave Geneva immediately for my safety . Where has Victor gone ? You must tell me , orJustine will die . Werner ! Listen to me . Victor 's brother is already dead . Others have been killed , and more will follow unless we act . - Victor is responsible , Elizabeth ! - Who are you ? Why would you turn me against Victor ? - Werner . - I want to help him , Eliza - Elizabeth . Reference Mary Shelley . Born : Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin . Mary Shelley . Born : 1797 . Died : 1851 . Mistress to the poet Lord Byron , and wife to the poet Percy Shelley . She is chiefy remembered as the author of the novel Frankenstein . - Hard copy novel . - Printing a hard copy . The subject matter is artificial intelligence . Miss Shelley wrote the book when she was only 19 years old while living with Byron and Shelley at the Villa Diodati presently some 200 yards north-northeast . Be forewarned , Dr. Buchanan , probability is high that they are late sleepers . Maybe you could , uh , point that thing another way ? Why so ? Tourist shooting season opened today . I 've bagged three already . Yes , but I 'd hate to be shot without a proper introduction . You must be Lord Byron . I have no intention of introducing myself and I feel quite persecuted when British trespassers loaf about my property . No , I 'm not a trespasser . I 'm an admirer . Dr. Joe Buchanan . You 're not British , are you ? Well , I 'm sort of , uh , nouveau American . - What about those ? - What ? Those contrivances . Oh . These are a gift to one of the greatest visionaries of the 19th century . My God . These lenses are exceptional . Are you an inventor ? A scientist . Really ? I thought all American scientists were named Benjamin Franklin . Ah . Let 's see what Mistress Mary 's doing . Damn . Nothing scandalous . Writing as usual . What a waste of female talent . Perhaps Miss Godwin has literary talent as well . - What do you want here , sir ? - I must see Mary . Miss Godwin . A suitor ? Oh , no . What will Shelley say ? We breakfast late , Buchanan . Join us . Prove yourself an amusing guest . We suffer from too much peace here . There is murder at hand in Geneva . Well , now , what 's this ? A bailiff , I hope , or a poet . Meet Percy Shelley , my fellow reprobate in exile . Ah , he 's risen . Joe Buchanan . - An American scientist . - Mmm . And are those slippers American too ? I 've quizzed him already , Percy . They were made by a Mr. Florsheim in a redundancy called New York , New York . What brings you all the way to our little paradise , Doctor ? Just another moth drawn to Mary 's glib . Listen , I 'm here because of the imminent execution ofJustine Moritz . I believe he wants to take Mary to the hanging . - How romantic . - You know how it is , Percy . Sex and death . Ah ! There she is . My love . Mary , allow me to introduce ... Dr. Joseph Buchanan . As it happens , we 've already met . How do you do again , Dr. Buchanan ? That is the most mysterious cloud I 've ever seen . I see a remote sunlight glean as though t 'were not a cloud at all but a gateway to a distant world . What did you want to see me about , Dr. Buchanan ? Miss Godwin , I know that you 've been following the trial ofJustine Moritz . You must help me try and stop her from hanging . - Why come to me ? - Because you know that the girl is innocent . You know the truth . Well , that 's what your book is about . What do you know of my book ? I 've only a few chapters of the story . Are you from a journal , sir ? Worse . Maybe a publisher . Yes , I believe the girl is innocent . But I don 't know anything that would help her . Forgive me . I thought that you knew the truth . I thought that you could help me . - Back off ! - Please , sir . I 've made my peace with God . The girl goes free ! Somebody help - No ! We 're going to make you better . Shh . The girl - They killed the girl . And they very nearly killed you too . I watched the whole terrible incident with these . Oh . You were very brave ... and foolish . - How did you get here ? - I sailed across the lake to rescue you . - How did you know I was writing a book ? - It 's a long story , Mary . Well , it 's usually better to start at the beginning . Suppose I show you instead ? Is this your carriage ? Yes . Yes , it is . It 's amazing . Like to go for a ride ? I 'd be delighted . Good afternoon , Mary . I am not a carriage , but a car . Let 's fy . Are we fying ? No . It 's just a great suspension system . I 've never even imagined anyone like you before . Well , that 's not surprising , because I don 't exist yet . I 'm from the future . Well , that 's absurd . I know of your book because I 've read it . But that 's impossible . I 've only just started writing . And you 'll finish it and you 'll publish it and you 'll add a new word to every language on Earth - Frankenstein . - This says Mary Shelley . - Congratulations . My book ! My book will be known in the future . How does it end ? How do I end ? And Shelley - Do we die young ? Do you really want to know that ? Stop the car . I 'll have my own life . Well , Joe from the future , wherever did you come from ? There . Percy 's cloud . He was right . It is the gateway to another world . I made it , came through it fractured the core of time and space . I wanted to do the world a favor . But like Victor Frankenstein , I created a monster . Then it 's true . Dr. Frankenstein has created a man . I 'm afraid it is . It is an abomination in the eyes of God . You don 't believe in God ? I don 't know . I see . Science is your religion . Well , I never thought of it like that . I 've tried to imagine what a man of science must live with . I think he lives with madness . With madness ? The madness of possibility . I 'm sorry if I 've said something to upset you , Joe . Upset me ? Mary , you amaze me . You live in the 19th century and yet you understand the future infinitely better than I do . I wish I did . Percy and Byron preach free love . I practice it . You and I are under an enchantment , Joe . Will you fy to some other place in time ? I wish it were that easy . This place , this time - I don 't even understand why I ended up here . I 'm afraid I have a theory . Would you like to hear it ? Mm-hmm . I think you 're here to stop Dr. Frankenstein . - Werner ? - Mistress ? - Please prepare my carriage . - Shall I drive you , Miss Levenza ? No , I must go alone ... to see Dr. Frankenstein . As you wish . Are you going to kill it ? No , quite the opposite . I must make him a mate . You were a madman . You heard him . He threatened to kill Elizabeth . Buchanan , please . I have laid all the groundwork but I haven 't been able to store enough electricity . I know you have abilities beyond my own in such matters . I think I should show you something . What is this ? Victor , this is your future . Who are you ? What are you ? Victor made me . Victor ? But I am to be Victor 's wife . - He would not want you to hurt me . - I know . A human being is no match for my creature . We are not very well made , you know . Our eyes are poor our limbs use muscles to the disadvantage ofboth . I have made wonderful improvements . Wonderful improvements . - Victor ! - There 's something over here ! Mr. Victor ! - There he is . - Hang on a second . I didn 't do this . - Get the rope . - Get him ! Get him up ! - String him up ! - Hang him ! Use the tree ! Here 's a rope ! Let 's get him ! Stop ! Be careful . He can help us . An abomination in the eyes of God . Are you alive ? Yes . I think so . Good . Ah , Buchanan , you 're awake . Bring him here . I 've been studying this pamphlet that explains your carriage . I presume it can store enormous amounts of electrical power . Yes , it can . But you have to supply the superconductor with tremendous power to begin with . - You 'll get no help from me . - Buchanan it could take me a few days to analyze this machine on my own . Perhaps you would like more time to think about it ? I could let him play with you all night . So , can you make it work for me ? I must prepare . Watch him . Good evening , Dr. Buchanan . My sensors indicate substantial damage to my electrical system . So forget that . Have you completed the calculations I asked for ? Yes . All probabilities indicate that it is not possible to reverse a time slip effect . Not possible ? Why not ? - Time space unbound . - Come on . Explain yourself . Time space unbound is the logical outcome of your experiment , Doctor . You have introduced a new condition into the physical world . - What is that ? - It 's a machine that thinks and talks . What is the probability of surviving a laser-generated implosion ? - Did you make it ? - Yes . The probability is high that you will be transported to a new place and time . Is it a man ? No , it is not a man . Are you strong enough to carry those cables to the top of the bell tower ? Yes . Victor made me very strong . Good boy . Victor did not make you , did he ? No . Look ! Can you climb up and connect the coil to the bottom of the cross ? Who made you ? I don 't know ! God , maybe ! Throw this over . Now the other one . Who is God Maybe ? I think you 'd better ask Victor about that . Yes , I will . - Load laser implosion program . - Loading now . When you get maximum power then you just turn my little baby on . Good-bye , Dr. Buchanan . Leave her ! My God , Victor . What have you done ? I am reversing a gross mistake of fate . No . The pain and the guilt have driven you insane . Oh , have they now ? Well , I can live with pain and I can live with guilt . Subdue him . It is Elizabeth I cannot live without . And she will have new life . No one can create a soul . The soul ? That 's a crutch for weaker men than you and I , Buchanan . There now . It begins . Pull the first lever . Power to implosion is now 98.1 % and rising . Power , 96.5 , holding . The next two levers . Now ! No . No ! We must have more power or she will die ! There 's nothing more that I can do ! Pull every remaining lever . Maximum input . Begin implosion sequence . She lives . She lives ! Activate laser . What is happening ? Meet ... My monster . What have you done ? - Victor . - Put it back the way it was . I can 't . Put it back the way it was , or I will kill you . There 's nothing I can do . Then damn you . Elizabeth ? Yes . It 's Victor . Step away now . Come here . Come to me . No . No ! Victor . Kill him . The rupture of space and time is spreading in a chain reaction . Who knows what exists in this frozen tomorrow ? Apart from him , the only signs oflife in this remote place are remnants of a future civilization . Welcome , Dr. Buchanan . This world you made is better than Victor 's . It is barren as I am barren lonely as I am alone . I didn 't create this . I don 't even know where we are . This is the brain of the great city beyond . The last refuge of mankind . What am I that you must destroy me ? An abomination in the eyes of God . So what are you ? I am Frankenstein . Power on , Dr. Buchanan . You don 't understand ! You cannot kill me ! You think you have killed me but I am with you forever . I am unbound .

You interrupted an endless conversation which leads nowhere and accomplishes nothing . - Ooh , what 's wrong with him ? - Girls .

I 'd give anything to figure out how to talk to her and not sound like a complete idiot . CHETT : Having girl trouble , girls ? Ah , don 't be ashamed - We 're all ashamed for you . - We don 't need your help . I have found that women respond to flattery . For instance , I 'm driving my jeep . I see something I like . I roll down the window . I offer up a compliment like , " Nice butt . " Or , " I 'd pay good money for a girl like you . " Makes them feel real sexy . Oh , they may act angry yell back , flip you off slap you with a restraining order forbidding you from coming within 500 yards of them of their stupid cat ! But ... it 's all part of that little game they call romance . When you 're done yelling at them how do you talk to them ? Geez , you don 't talk to women you touch women . You talk to guys . What is the matter with you ? Now , one last secret . Percentages . Ask out every chick you see . Sooner or later , you get lucky . It 's a number game . Leave no stone unturned . Any questions ? My work here is done . LISA : Good morning . - You guys want a ride to school ? - I don 't think so . It does 120 in second gear .

Maybe she just doesn 't know , okay ? Oh , I know . I don 't think you could handle it . I 'll let you know what I can handle . I made you , and now I 'm commanding you . - Oh , now you 're commanding me ? - Yes . I 'm commanding you . Teach us everything there is to know about women now . Oh , yes , master . I am but a simple genie . - Your wish is my command . - We 're dead . - What did you do ? - You 'll see . So , you feel like you understand women now ? Nope . You ? No . I don 't feel different at all . She 's all talk . Hey , I should wear this shirt every day . I don 't think it 's the shirt . Is your portal ajar ? Nope . Airtight . Then why is everyone looking at us funny ? Check it out . I 'm in heaven ! Hi . How are you doing ? I 'm Ned . - This is Mike . - That 's nice . So ... what 's going on ? - You two , uh ... new here ? - No . You need some help finding a class ? No . Why would we need help ? Okay . Maybe we 'll see you around then .

Oh , my God , we 're girls . Gary , do I look like a girl to you ? No . Do I look like a girl to you ? - No . - I couldn 't stay away . - I think we look like girls to him . - Uh , we were just leaving . Hey , what 's the hurry ? I just got here . Sorry . We got to run . Mmm . Shake that cake . Hey ... no running in the halls , girls . Haven 't you heard the new rule ? You got to stop and talk to me . Normally , we 'd loved to , but we really got to run . I 've got football practice after school . Maybe you 'd like to watch . Uh ... maybe . Did you just make a date with a football player for after school . I said " maybe . " What are we going to do ? Hide ! Hey , girls . Forgot to put my makeup on . Do you have a compact , Wy ... Nova ? Sorry , Gar ... Uh ... iette . I left it in that ... thing girls use to put makeup in . I guess we 'll just stand here and tease out bangs . Look at us . We 're ... we 're ... we 're ... babes . Total , hot babes . I told you never to get Lisa angry . Look what she did . We got to come up with ... Gary , you can 't ... feel anything ? No . It 's just an optical illusion . - Lisa , look at us . - Ooh , you look kind of cute . It isn 't funny . This time you 've definitely lost it . Look , you 're the one who wanted to know everything there is to know about girls . - I believe that was your command . - That wasn 't my command . Why am I the one who 's being punished ? He 's your friend . An opportunity what better way to explore the world of women ? Take advantage of it . She 's got a point . Do you think these will show up on film ? WYATT : Gary ... Wow . - Well , have fun , girls . - Oh , great . Great . She 's gone . I have beautiful skin . I don 't know . Maybe this isn 't so awful . We could use this experience to get an insight into how girl 's minds operate . Observe the way they interact in their own environment . Exactly what I was thinking . I could do this for the rest of my life . Hey , looking for a place to sit ? Uh , no , thanks . I feel like the meat loaf special . Hey , there 's Matt and Rog . Let 's give them a thrill . If a girl likes you as a friend she will never think of you as anything but a friend . No , this is different . We started out as friends and then ... - Hi . - Hi . Mind if we sit here ? Let 's get straight to it . We know how hard it is for a guy to walk up to a girl and talk to her . So we thought just this once , we 'd make the first move . You don 't have to impress us . We already like you . That 's right . We like guys other girl overlook the type of guys who are into computer repairs and comic books guys who don 't get caught up in fads like exercise . Or fashion . Or personal hygiene . What do you say ? Do you want to go steady ? Man , they turned to stone . Are we that pathetic with girls ? Hey . Babe . I can 't believe you gave him your phone number . - It got rid of him , didn 't it ? - Besides , it wasn 't my real number . You didn 't give him your real number ? I hate it when girls do that . He was so nice to you . Now what are we going to do ? I 'm starved . Got any money ? Yeah , at home . But I can 't show up looking like this . My parents wouldn 't exactly understand . I 've got to eat soon . Whoa ! Double your pleasure ! Double my fun ! Aw , man , your brother 's hitting on us . Don 't look at him . Mm-hmm . You got a butt like a french model . Want to go do something ? Hang out ? Maybe get something to eat ? Are you buying ? You bet . You 've lost your mind . A girl 's got to eat . Oh , man . Anybody ever tell you two you make a lovely foursome ? ( Laughing ) Hey , I like a girl who 's not afraid to eat like a guy . I don 't know what 's with this one . My name 's Wynona . How about a brownie ? Oh , anything you want , honey . And some more soda . It 's yours . Can I have a soda ? I 'm telling you , Wy , girls have it made . - Some girls . - What 's your problem , Wynona ? You 've been too busy being belle of the ball to notice I 'm not having a very good time . He acts like I 'm not even here . Let me play this back for you . You 're saying , you 're upset because your brother finds me more attractive than you ? You 're right . It 's sick . I just wish I were blonde . Where 's my brownie ? Well , look what the cat dragged in . No ! No , it can 't be . Chett 's picking up on Melinda . My Melinda - And she 's eating our brownie . - Will you forget about the stupid brownie . The woman of my dreams needs my protection . What are you going to do , whale on him with your pumps ? No . I 'm going to throw a hissy fit . Melinda ... sounds like an exotic dancer 's name . Have I ever seen you at skinny dippers ? - I think so . - Excuse me . Who do you think you are , treating me like this ? Do you think I 'm some dog toy you can just toss to the side when you get tired of me ? Whoa , Whoa . Slow down , blue eyes . I will not slow down ! I thought I meant something to you . Did you think it wasn 't going to hurt ? Well , it does hurt . It hurts bad . I 'm sorry , fellow girl . you won 't let this butch jerk do to you what he did to me . I think somebody needs to take her midol . - Having fun ? - Not as much fun as gariette . Everybody treats me like the ugly stepsister . Oh , you 're just being hard on yourself . You know what they say- - love strikes when you least expect it . Huh ? Hey , Babe . - Oh , no . - Missed you at football practice . Sorry about that . And you know your answering machine tells the time and temperature ? Can I buy you a ... cheesecake ? I hate you . I hate you ! - I think you 'd better leave . - I will . But rust , let me clear one thing up ... she means nothing to me . But you have butt like a french model . I hate guys like that . Why did you go out with him ? - I was hungry . - I 'd rather starve . You 're a mess . Come on . Let 's go to the bathroom and get you cleaned up . I love it when they whip the cheese like this . - Uh-huh . Great . - Blue eyes went wacko . Finish up . We 're leaving . Who 's this jerk ? Why don 't you turn yourself around walk away and noboby gets his puny ass kicked . Excuse me ? Did you just say you wanted me to rip your spine out and strangle you with it ? I know how you feel . I just broke up with my boyfriend . Well , I 'm sure you 've got the next one lined up . You 're so great looking . I bet you won 't be alone for more than a day- - Day and a half , tops . I didn 't date for a year before my last boyfriend . A year ? Boys , please ... don 't fight over me . She 's right . What are we going ? She 's not even the cute one . She wouldn 't even come to my football practice . You play football ? I love football . You do ? You want to come watch practice ? Could I ? ( Laughing ) You freak ! Guys just freak me out . I don 't know how to talk to them . I always get nervous and come off sounding stupid . You ? You 're nervous around guys ? Terrified . I don 't understand what they want- - besides the obvious . I know what I want . Yeah ? But it 's probably not something you could put into words . Oh , no . I know exactly what it is . I want a guy who can talk to me the way that we 're talking right now you know ? No come-ons , no games . No clever opening lines ? Aren 't you sick of them ? After the kind of day I had ? Yeah . - You going to be okay ? - Sure . Thanks . Yes ! I know the secret ! I figured it out . What 's so simple ? Women . The whole mystery of women . They 're just as afraid of us as we are of them . Thanks , Lisa . I 'm sorry I ever command you . Apology accepted . I needed to learn a lesson here , and I have . Women just need to be related to person-to-person . No come-ons , no pick up lines . Just sincerity . Now I 'm going to score with Melinda for sure . I 'm a guy ... again . - Perfect timing . - Yep . Perfect . Hi. um ... I 'm Gary and this is not a come-on line . I 'd like to get to know you . In the ladies room ? Hey , there 's a pervert in here ! I love this . This car is great . Pretty great . No cup holder . Relax . We 're here and may I suggest a nine iron . Captioned by Grantman Brown

 - 7.30 . - Great ! - See you tomorrow , Beth . - OK . - See you tomorrow . - Clean up your stations ! .. get some information about a crackhouse . This is pretty direct information that came from an informant who made a buy and ... It 's that direct . It 's easy to get a search warrant ... I 'm home ! - Hi . - Hi , Mom . - Hey . - Hey ? All I get is " Hey " ? Hey , Mom . I 'm gonna take a quick shower . You guys interested in getting a pizza delivered ? If that was a yes , you can call the order in . And no pepperoni for me . Hello ? Oh . Yeah . Sure . - Ow ! - I 'll be back in five minutes . OK , butt-crumb ? He said he was only gonna be gone five minutes and that was over four hours ago . Yes . No , I don 't know who called him . The last person to see him ? His younger brother . What 's your 10-3 ? Over . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Gary ? Gary Kane ? Go get him a blanket . It 's gonna be OK , son . Hey ! We 're here to help you . Hey ! What 's wrong ? Oh , my God ! Gary Kane : 16 years old , high-school junior , ... .. C student , first-string varsity football , member of the local 4-H Club . Not one of Wisconsin 's more remarkable kids , but still the apple of his mother 's eye . - What does that mean ? - Nobody knows . - What does the police report say ? - He received a phone call and left his home . He was discovered in the woods 12 hours later . He 's been unable to give a statement . - Any evidence of sexual assault ? - No . Does it seem like a schoolboy prank ? The other victims have had to be sedated and hospitalised since their ordeals . - They were reportedly hysterical with fear . - Victims ? You mean there have been others ? One in eastern Wisconsin , one three towns away . Both with the same words written in black Magic Marker . - What 's your interest in this ? - The sheriff in Delta Glen , Wisconsin , ... .. thinks he knows what 's been happening to these kids . - What 's that ? - He thinks they 've been possessed . There 's something I think you oughta see first . They 're called the Church of the Red Museum . They 're followers of a guy , Odin , that moved here three years ago and bought a ranch . - What 's the significance of the name ? - Odin and the rest of ' em are vegetarians . They drove the ranch right into the ground , turned 500 head of beef cattle into pets . He calls it a monument to barbarism . Probably went over big with the local ranchers . It takes some big ones to set down in cow country and start a church like his . Kinda stick out like a sore thumb , don 't they ? Sheriff , from what you 've told us , ... .. they seem unlikely to be involved in the kind of activities you described . Well , I ... I won 't say another word . You can just see for yourself . That 's Odin . Today is a blessing from our Lord and Master , who awaits his flock , ... .. in this time , the dawning of the Age of Aquarius , ... .. 18 earth years from the beginning of the New Kingdom . The Guides speak through me today as messengers of the Word , ... .. that we may be free from death and the passage into spirit . As the acceleration continues , we , the enlightened ... .. must bring the teachings of the skills for survival to mankind . - They 're walk-ins . - What are " walk-ins " ? We , the second souls of the first bodies , ... We , the second souls of the first bodies , ... .. bearers of the Word and keepers of the sacraments of a new enlightenment ... Believers in soul transference . Spirits who 've taken possession of other people 's bodies . - Blessed mission and toil . - Blessed mission and toil . Our struggle is transcendent , and your guidance , our Guides , ... .. will carry us toward the dawning of a new age . .. will carry us toward the dawning of a new age . Today we bear witness to three who do not believe . We encourage them to open their hearts and minds to our teachings , ... .. that they who slaughter the flesh ... .. slaughter their own souls , and must be taught the way . I only remember parts of it . Which parts are those ? I was in the woods , and ... .. I felt ... a spirit enter me . When you say " spirit " , Gary , I 'm not sure what you mean . It ... It might have been an animal spirit . I can 't explain it . Something ... .. just came over me . And you don 't remember who called you ? Anything at all about what happened immediately after you left home that night ? Have you ever had any dealings with anyone from the Church of the Red Museum ? I see them around . Do you have reason to believe that they may be involved in what happened to you ? Now , tell him what you told me , Gary . - Hi - Hi - Who are you ? - Stevie . Oh , you 're in all the pictures . You must be Gary 's younger brother . I 'm Dana . Stevie , do you remember who your brother might have gone out to see the other night ? Did he say anything ? Scully , we 'll meet you outside . - Has this boy ever been in any trouble ? - Gary ? No , I 've known him since he was a kid . He 's the same age as my son . - Do you see a notable difference in him ? - Yeah ... Yeah . Gary Kane lived for football . He 's a damn good athlete , too . Now he won 't even suit up . The Red Museum - how are they treated by the local citizens ? - Nobody cares for ' em . - Are they singled out , ... .. shop owners refusing to sell to them , stuff like that ? There 's a reasonable amount of tension , but most folks are happy to just try to avoid ' em . Can you recommend a good motel in the area ? Sure . You 're staying for a bit . You think there 's something to this ? I wanna run a check on the church and this guy Odin . If you could just show us a good motel and maybe point out a good place to eat . You 've come to the right place . You know , Mulder , ribs like these , ... .. I 'd say the Church of the Red Museum has its work cut out for it . Thanks . So ... you started to tell me about walk-ins , but I 'm not sure if I grasped the finer points . It 's kind of a New Age religion based on an old idea , ... .. that if you lose hope or despair and wanna leave this mortal coil , ... - .. you become open and vulnerable . - To inhabitation by a new spirit . A new enlightened spirit . According to the literature , Abe Lincoln was a walk-in . And Mikhail Gorbachev . And Charles Colson , Nixon 's adviser . - But not Nixon ? - No . Not even they wanna claim Nixon . So , are you still subscribing to the sheriff 's claims of a possession ? I don 't know . In the absence of any other plausible explanation , it 's a novel theory . Well , I feel kinda weird saying this , but I got the creeps in that apartment . - Really ? - Towel-head ! Whoo-hoo ! - Yeah . Why , what 's going on ? - Turn around , man . Hey ! - Vegeburger ! Who let you out ? - The spur posse just rode into town . - Hey , diaper-head ! We 're talking to you , man . - How 's your pet cow ? - Did you get any milk out of him ? - We 're talking to you , Aladdin . What 's the matter , diaper-head , huh ? Huh ? - Nothing . - Leave him alone . Leave him alone . Go home . Go ahead , go home . - Catch you later , Red . - You got a problem ? - Yeah . But who asked you ? - I see four against one . I got a problem . Mulder ? Yeah , well , why don 't you run along with the little wife ? You 're gonna miss the tour bus . She 's got a gun . What 's she gonna do ? Shoot us ? Go call my dad , Katie . I think he 'd like to hear about this . - Who 's your dad ? - He 's the sheriff . - I think he would like to hear about this . - Come on . Let 's just get out of here , Rick . Kinda hard to tell the villains without a scorecard . Pupperdog ? Is that you ? Pupper dog ? What are you doing here , huh , girl ? No ! Get off me ! Get off me ! Help me ! Please , somebody help me ! Help me ! Please ! Yeah , this is all good stuff . See what else you can find on him from the NCIC ... .. and call me back - at this number , or on my cellular . - I just examined the girl . - What d 'you find ? Not much until the toxicology report came back . They found traces of an unspecified alkaloid substance in her blood , possibly an opiate , ... .. and a dangerously large quantity of something called scopolamine . - The stuff they use for motion sickness ? - In small dosages . Anything past .2 micrograms and you 've got a powerful anaesthetic and hallucinogen . It 's been in the news because Colombian gangs have been using it in kidnappings . - Is it a controlled substance ? - You 'd probably have to be a doctor ... .. to get a hold of these quantities . Richard Odin , also known as Doug Herman , left AMA in 1986 ... .. over questionable ethics inquiry . Did not renew licence . I 'll drive . I 'm Special Agent Fox Mulder . We 're with the FBI . - We 'd like to speak to Richard Odin . Is he in ? - Just a moment . Mr Odin ? We 'd like to ask you some questions . May we come inside ? I 'm sorry . I can 't allow you in this house . - We can get a warrant if that 's what it takes . - You can , but you will not enter the building . - Well , how 's that ? - Because you 're meat eaters . The building cannot be desecrated by your presence . I believe I am within my religious rights to prevent it . You can 't hide behind them if a crime has been committed . Have I been accused of a crime ? We can always determine that elsewhere . Can you step outside please , sir ? Can you step outside , Mr Odin ? We 're placing you under arrest . Are you familiar with a substance called scopolamine ? Are you familiar with inhumane treatment of beef and dairy cattle ? Just answer the question , Mr Odin . Yes , I know it . But I 've never prescribed it or administered it . - Have you ever ordered others to do so ? - No . Do your beliefs preclude you from exacting revenge , physically or psychically , ... .. on those who might not share them ? - The barbarians will be cleansed ... - Answer the question ! You did it , didn 't you ? - You did something to those kids ! - Sheriff . We 've already had to go through this once with your kid . If you 'll just take a walk . Sheriff , come here a second . For a holy man , you 've got quite a knack for pissing people off . We got problems down the street . Keep your minds open to the wisdom of the Guides . All we ask is that you listen . Question what we say , and consider it seriously . All right , man . Let 's do it . End the slaughter . The rights of the just must be protected , ... .. just as the barbarism must cease . Violence against nature begets violence against man . How about a little cow blood ? What do you think you 're doin ' ? ! Get outta here ! Get ! Get ! Get in the truck ! - They asked for it . - They asked for it . That 's right . - You the FBI agents ? - Yes . I got something I 'd like to show you . This pasture land ... belonged to my granddad . He bought it in 1890 . He died right over there , next to that cattle pen . 82 years old . Just ... fell off the tractor one morning . My dad worked this piece for the next 40 years . And I put in 25 myself before I decided to call it quits . Sold it for 80 times what my granddad paid . - Why 'd you sell it ? - Business changed . - People changed , too . - In what way ? Competition . Used to get by with 50 milk cows . Now you gotta have 500 . Used to turn ' em out to pasture . Now you keep ' em in pens and grain-feed ' em . - You said you wanted to show us something . - You 're looking at it . See those men over there ? They 're injecting the cattle with something called BST - bovine somatotropin . - A genetically engineered growth hormone . - Shoot ' em up , ... .. and a cow 'll produce ten per cent more milk . Feed it to beef cattle , more meat on the hoof . Changed the business . Changed a whole lot of things . How do you mean ? Well , that , uh , fracas in town this afternoon . Ten , even five years ago , never would 've happened . People around here have changed , you know . They 've gotten mean , spiteful . Dog eat dog . We had seven rapes here last year . By high-school boys . Well , that , um ... This business of the kids being found in the woods . Well , I think that you 're going to find it all comes from the same root source . - The growth hormone ? - Yes , sir . But those hormones have been proven safe . They 've been cleared by the FDA . Says who ? The government ? I don 't know , Doc . I 'm losing oil pressure like crazy . - I don 't know what 's goin ' on . - How far are we from the airport ? We 're not gonna make it . I 'm gonna have to find someplace to put it down . Look out ! - We 're still trying to ID the pilot . - What about the second body ? That 's Dr Jerrold Larson . - Did you know him ? - Yeah ... He delivered my kid . There 's something else over here I want you to see . Thank you . It looks like the doctor may have been delivering more than babies . That 's why I brought you out here . - Any clue what this is about ? - I have no idea . Jerry Larson was a pillar in this town , the last of the country doctors . Wherever he was coming from , that was one hell of a house call . This has nothing to do with those kids ? I think we 'll know more once we find out what this is . You 're sure ? Both kids ? No , it 's OK . I 'm sure you 're correct . Thank you very much . Scully , you 're not gonna believe this . The out-of-town kids and the kids abducted here - every one was delivered and treated through childhood by Dr Larson . The print-outs we found were shipping orders , along with credit card numbers , ... .. each number corresponding to a card in the victim 's family . - Why would he carry credit card numbers ? - Maybe to track them , ... .. the way companies track stolen cards . But why ? And what was he treating them for ? What was he treating them with ? I don 't know . We won 't get the test results back on the vial until tomorrow . You think it 's bovine growth hormone ? That was the first thing through our minds , but it doesn 't track . - Not with that case full of cash . - It doesn 't answer the question ... .. about who 's marking those kids ... or why . Away with you . - So , I 'll see you in the morning . - Yeah . 8.30 sharp . Howdy . Hi . Sorry to come unannounced . Gary 's not home right now . Actually , we wanted to talk with you , if that 's OK . I don 't know what to say . You think Dr Larson was doing some kind of tests on Gary ? Well , thinking back , was there anything that seemed strange to you ? - Was Gary sick often ? - No ... Gary 's never been sick a day in his life . Gary was never sick ? - No . - Why was he going to Dr Larson ? Dr Larson gave him vitamin shots . He gave them to a lot of kids . He said it was like treating teeth with fluoride , as a preventative measure . - Did you ever take Gary to another doctor ? - No . Jay had wanted to . Jay 's your husband ? Yes . He was concerned Gary wasn 't growing . Jay was six five . He wanted Gary to play college ball . - But then there was Jay 's accident . - What accident ? It was seven years ago . He worked at the packing plant . He had an accident with one of the machines . Excuse me . What is this ? What ? - This light here . - I don 't know . There 's something back there . What is it , Mulder ? Looks like somebody 's private little movie studio . What ? Oh , my God . Gotta drain the lizard . What do you want , applause , man Rick ? Rick ? Go and keep him from coming over here , would you ? Sheriff , we 're gonna find who did this . Get away from him . Get back . Oh , my God . Ricky . Son ! No . No . No ! His name is Gerd Thomas . He 's owned the building for 21 years . He used to run a daycare center out of it . They 're holding him for us . What is it ? I know that face . What ? That 's quite a video library you 've compiled for yourself . I especially like the ones with the little boys . I know . I 'm ... a sick man . No . No , men who know they 're sick try to get help . You just kept right at it for years . I didn 't mean to hurt anyone . Did you kidnap those kids ? Yes . Are you prepared to confess to those crimes ? - Yes . - And to the murder of Rick Mazeroski ? No . I never murdered anybody . Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski ? Did you write this on his back ? ! - Oh , my God ! - Answer the question . No , I ... I never killed him . I never killed anybody . I ... - I really love those kids . - Is this how you express your love for them ? - Did you kidnap Rick and write on his back ? - Yes ! - Why ? - Because of what he 'd become . - What had he become ? - Because those kids have become monsters . You 're not making any sense . Now ... make sense to me . Because of Dr Larson and because of the tests . Excuse me . OK , what tests ? Dr Larson was using those kids as guinea pigs . And he was using us , too . - What do you mean , using you ? - To inoculate the cattle . - With growth hormone ? - I don 't know exactly what it was . But he was paying us a lot of money to do it . He was paying you to inject the cattle with something and you didn 't know what it was ? Not until later . Not until after all those rapes and ... Dr Larson told my boss he felt responsible for everything that those kids have done , ... .. and that he was giving them the same inoculations . - Was Dr Larson involved in the kidnapping ? - No . No . He didn 't want his secret to come out . He didn 't care about those kids like me . - Mulder ? - Mmhm ? I ... think he 's telling the truth . - I don 't think he killed anyone . - How can you be sure ? I just got the toxicology report back on the vial . The residue couldn 't be analysed ... .. because it contained synthetic corticosteroids with unknown amino acids . That 's purity control . Do you know what you 're saying , Scully ? He was inoculating those kids with antibodies ... .. derived from what may be an extraterrestrial source . - He 's been injecting them with alien DNA . - No , Mulder . That was never proven . It 's the same substance as in the Erlenmeyer flask . - The same material Deep Throat died for . - Yes . It all makes sense . They 've been conducting an experiment . Somebody 's been paying to have those kids injected with alien DNA . - It 's been going on for years . - Does that man know about it ? No . He just blew their cover . I don 't think he knows any more than he 's telling us . His boss must have . They found him shot to death in a cow pasture . - What ? ! - I think I know who shot him , Mulder . That man that I recognised on the road today . That 's the same man that executed Deep Throat . Well , whoever 's behind this , he 's here covering their tracks . He 's gonna go after the kids . Get the sheriff and meet me at Gary Kane 's apartment . And Scully ... I want this guy alive . - Where 's Gary ? - He 's in his bedroom . Go pack some clothes . You 're all coming with me . - What ? ! - I 'll explain later . Those credit card numbers . Every kid 's family listed , get them packed up . - Call out every man you 've got . - Where are we taking them ? - I need your help . - For ? It may offend your religious sensibilities , but it could help save some kids ' lives . Sheriff ? Where 's Mulder ? He told me to make sure the kids were safe . He thought there was some other place this guy might be . Stop right there ! Hey ! Don 't move ! Put it down . Now ! Just put the lighter down . Hey ! Get him outta here . Get everyone outta here . Come on . This place could blow . File number XW0060361 . The identity of the man shot in the slaughterhouse has yet to be determined . His name , any record of his past , present or immigration status , have yet to be found . His ﬁngerprints are not on file in either the FBI or national system of records . At this time , it remains doubtful that anyone will come forward to ID or claim the body . Under analysis , the inoculant found in the broken via / s was isolated ... .. and determined to be an unstable antibody of no known biological origin . After three weeks of study , the components of the serum , probably synthetic , ... .. had broken down structurally and in this retrograde state cannot be analysed further . This coincides with the development of a severe and undiagnosed ﬂu-like ailment ... .. affecting the children believed to have been inoculated , and some local families . To date , none of the members of the Church of the Red Museum ... .. have contracted this illness . I suspect whoever was doing this may have been using them as a control group . The shipping manifests for milk and beef tainted by the unspeciﬁed inoculant ... .. do not provide enough information to track their destinations . A local advisory and quarantine have been established . Further inquiry has been promised by the pertinent government health agencies . The FBI investigation into this case is currently at a standstill . The case remains open and unsolved . I made this !

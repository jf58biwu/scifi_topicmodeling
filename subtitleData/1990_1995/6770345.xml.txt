 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . ( CHANTING TENCTONESE ) ( CHANTING TENCTONESE ) MATT : Forget about it , George , we 're not going to catch anybody ... by sleeping with the Ding Dongs . We 're not supposed to sleep . We 're on a stakeout . Yeah , six nights in mini mart land is enough . But he 's already held up every store within a six-mile radius . Sooner or later he has to come to us . I 'm coming up with a new plan . Who took the doughnut I had here ? Why are you humans so impatient ? George , I 'm not cramming myself on top of that beer cooler anymore . Really ? I find the arrangements quite comfortable . Maybe you 're used to tiny little vibrating crawlspaces ... but I didn 't grow up on a spaceship , okay ? ( PHONE RINGING ) Detective Francisco . Yes , Susan , hi . No , it was a very pleasant night . They called ? I am ? Well , that 's wonderful . Yes , I 'm very excited . Tell Emily I am very proud . You , too . Goodbye . What ? I 've just been approved to coach Emily 's Little League team . Is that funny ? What do you know about baseball ? It 's true that ... the closest thing that we had to the sport in the ship was ejecting trash into space . But , after reading several books , I 've digested a great deal of information . Yeah , like what ? What would you like to know ? Don Drysdale 's batting average , 1961 ? .193 . Matthew , did you play baseball as a child ? Yeah , sure . Tink Riviere , 1925 . Let 's see . He played three games that year . He was up at bat only once and struck out . That would be .00 . Excuse me , what happened to the food around here ? Mr. Sparky Anderson tells a wonderful little anecdote in his book . He said ... Top of the ninth , tie ballgame , bases loaded , one out . You got your pitcher at the plate ... he 's been throwing smoke all day . What do you do ? Let 's see . That would parallel the 1989 Los Angeles-Cincinnati game ... in which manager Tom Lasorda had Mr. Jay Howell ... in exactly the same position . No , George . What would you do ? Then there was the ' 52 Dodgers . Yeah , and the ' 83 Mets and the ' 92 Pirates . Lot of input . What 's the answer ? Matthew , you could help me . Suicide squeeze . Keep your pitcher alive if you can . No . I mean with my team . Help me coach . No , George . But Emily would just love it ... I said no ! All right ? Want to know how many hot dogs were sold at the 1987 World Series ? Yeah , tell me that one . 373,923 . Great . You hungry ? Let 's go for breakfast . Sikes , Francisco . Ignore him . We 're going for food . Sikes . Sikes ! You 're going to the Ambassador . Come on , we 've been up all night . Yeah , somebody else was , too . Check out the body in the swimming pool . The Ambassador has been closed since ' 88 . I believe it was purchased by a Luibof sect . A what ? It obviously was a ceremonial cremation of one of their members . Obviously ? What are you talking about ? You 're looking at a pile of soot . There are crystals and artifacts mixed in with the remains . We 're investigating a homicide , lady . Just stay back . Matthew , she 's a spiritual leader . Perhaps we should step out for a moment . How do you know she 's a spiritual leader ? By her markings . What , you got built-in sunglasses ? We 're finding we 're adapting quite well to your sunlight . Got anything else up your sleeve ? Just my arms . Thank you . Klyseen has not yet completed his journey . Yeah , well , I got to disagree with you on that one . There must be some mistake . Please , let me help you . I 'm Okno . GEORGE : Venda Crystals ... OKNO : They are to guide us on our journey . You 're welcome to keep one if you wish . Look , there 's a hunk of toast ... down there and if you can 't come up with a good explanation ... we 're going to have to open a homicide investigation . What ? It was what I thought . What , you believe her ? I think we 've done what we can here . Matthew , what are you doing ? The 1993 Secular Senate granted them permission to practice their beliefs . Yeah , EPA Violation 444 grants me permission ... to practice my beliefs . We 're very strict on open fires . He 's always rather testy before breakfast . MATT : George , we 've been driving for a half hour , I want breakfast . GEORGE : Yes , of course , but now that we 're out here ... it will only take a minute . But ... I 'm really so excited . Emily and I 've been practicing out here all week on my lunch break ... working on the fundamentals . I think I 'm getting the hang of it . Where did this come from ? The trunk . Matthew , if you could just show me ... you know , give me some good old-fashioned insight . Insight ? This is a ball . You hit this with that and you catch it with this . That 's all the insight you need . Let 's go . Emily has been questioning me on the head-on Pete Rose slide . I just want to see if I have it down . The head ... George . I started a little too soon , but how was my form ? Nobody cares about form if they get you out . You were out . That 's not good , is it ? Look , George , it 's been great . Let 's go . No . Wait , please . I 'm quite good at catching . Watch this . Willie Mays , 1954 . Roberto Clemente , 1971 . Bo Jackson , 1994 . Pretty good . Not bad . What do you think ? That 's great , George . That 's really great . Can we go now ? I 'm starving . Matt . I 'm going to be the coach . It 's a very important position of responsibility . Emily is counting on me . So what do you want me to do about it ? Just give me a few pointers . I find batting the most difficult , but it 's very important . Yeah , you could say that . I 've almost got the hang of it . If you could just hum me a few . Please ? We do this . You buy breakfast . Wonderful . As many of those little chicken placentas as you like . It all happens right here at this little pentagon , doesn 't it , Matthew ? All right . Carl Yastrzemski . Pete Rose . Rod Carew . Just hit the ball , George . Yes , of course . All right , hit one for the ripper . Swing , batter , batter . Let it rip . Hey , batter , batter , batter . Matthew , one more . I wasn 't ready . Okay . You wanna play major league ? Let 's do it . Right . All right , here we go . Okay , that 's it , George . Let 's go . No , Matthew . One more , please . I know what I did there . You missed everything I threw at you . I 'm hungry , let 's go . All right , let 's see . Fernando has a no-hitter going into the bottom of the ninth . He winds , he pitches , he ... Get one in my glove , I 'll think about it . Right . Now , that was a Nolan Ryan split-finger fastball . You see , I overcompensated with my right wrist . Now , Mickey Mantle suggests that you raise your back elbow ... and bring back your back foot . Thus . Just one more , Matthew . It would be an enormous help . One more , Matthew , please . Don 't you want to get back on the mound ? Matt , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . All right , all right , then . Fire away . There it goes . Yes . The World Series is over . He hit that ball right out of the park . DISPATCHER : 1-William-152 , stand by . 52 , go . DISPATCHER : Officers on the scene report a male Newcomer at a convenience store . 211 is in progress . George , our guy 's working . Where 's it going down ? The store on Tyrone and Magnolia . 52 . Put us in route . I 'll get the stuff . What 's the situation ? Nice to see somebody . Place emptied out when some guy pumped it full of tear gas . That 's our MO , Matthew . Your partner covering the back ? I 'm by myself , guys . And you 're the first backup I 've seen . All right . I 'll get around there . George , you run it from here . Matthew , your gas mask . Right , thanks . I 'm gonna get closer . Cover me . Got you . Matthew , he 's moving toward the rear exit . Got it . Matthew . Get an ambulance . Do it now ! He doesn 't have a pulse . Come on , Matthew . Doctor , do you want to call in a cardiologist ? Hold it together , gang , now . Is he breathing ? He stopped on the way in . Blood pressure ? I 'm not getting anything . Call a code blue . Already did . What happened ? He must have been pushed against the wall . It must be his head . He 's ready , Doctor . Hold up on the CPR . Sinus bradycardia . Get me a half amp of bicarb . Let 's get him out of here . Please , Detective , you 'll have to wait out in the corridor . Yes , of course . Does it look bad ? The doctor will be out as soon as he can . Get me an amp of atropine now . My friend is gone . I 'm sorry . It wasn 't meant to happen . Who are you ? Look , I want you to take a couple of days off , George . I would rather stay busy . Yeah , I guess we all would . If there 's anything I can do ... Thank you . I 'm going to drive Cathy home . Is she all right ? Are you all right ? Yes . I just want to stay and take care of whatever must be done . Neemu , the doctor said he didn 't feel any pain . It was good that we had a chance to know him . He 's alive , he 's alive . He 's alive . He 's alive . The last robbery occurred three days ago ... here on Magnolia still within the six-mile radius . GRAZER : Any idea why he doesn 't go any further out than that ? We are working on the theory that our robber doesn 't have transportation ... and therefore must live within walking distance to all the convenience stores . No hits in the last three days . That , too , is his pattern . One hit every three or four days . So he 's probably ready for another attempt . Thank you , George . All right , people , three days since this guy put Sikes in a hurt locker ... the DA gave us an attempted murder warrant . I 'm tired of us looking bad . I want him . Understood ? All right , let 's roll . George . How is he doing ? He 's anxious to get back to work . Yeah , well , he should enjoy the vacation while he can . How are you doing ? Anxious to have my partner back . It looks like you 've got him . Hey , Albert , how is it going ? Sgt. Sikes . It 's so good to see you back with us . Yeah , well , considering the alternative ... Hey , George . Welcome back , Matthew . Yeah , thanks . What 's everybody looking at ? Never seen a dead man before ? Glad to see you back . I need to talk to you . Not here . Come on . And after the crystals fell on me ... he touched me , George . I could feel his hand on my chest . I could feel my body jerk alive again . What a wonderful dream . I didn 't know you dreamed when you were dead . Matt . We 've been working with several witnesses ... and a composite sketch of the perp ... with your input , would help us a great deal . I can tell you what he looked like . I can tell you what he smelled like , George . He touched me . He did more than touch you , he slammed you up against a brick wall . Matt , I still think the hospital released you much too soon . They didn 't have any choice . Look , I laid in that hospital bed for three days . You can do a lot of thinking in three days . I don 't know ... What ? You don 't know what ? Is it possible ... Can you Newcomers bring people back ? Back ? To life . Heal them . Matthew , we have many advantages over you ... but bringing back the dead is not one of them . Don 't you think maybe there could be this powerful guy on the ship who could ... No , Matthew . If there was such a being , with the losses on our ship ... he would be known . He was there , George . In the room . He touched me . The doctor said that you were revived because of a final thrust ... of adrenaline in your body . That 's the latest theory . The fact is they don 't know for sure . What 's important is that you 're alive . What 's important is finding out what brought me back . Someone would have seen him come out of the E.R. The room was empty when I went in . Matthew , you were alone . Yeah ? Then where did this come from ? OKNO : And so his journey is complete . It 's good to see you again . Are you finding comfort within our sect ? No , I get plenty of comfort on my own . Thank you very much . Right now , I 'm just looking for some answers . You 're welcome to join us in worship . Why don 't you just tell me what this thing is ? The Venda Crystal intrigues you . This one does . I didn 't see you slip it on me the last time I was here . Then would I be lying if I said I didn 't ? I don 't know . Would you ? The people of Luibof give these crystals to one another ... to help them through difficult passages . Well , I got one , and I 'm not hanging out with any Luibofs . If there 's a need for the crystal , please keep it . I don 't think so . Do your lips speak the same truth as your heart ? Look ... you ever heard of any Newcomers ... raising the dead ? One of you once wrote it is the human who is the alien . The human who has no cousin to the moon . So you have or haven 't ? Our ceremonies are open , Mr. Sikes . Experience our consciousness and many paths will be lighted . Yeah . Sure . I 'll think about that one . GRAZER : There goes one theory out the window . Doesn 't make sense . Six hits all within a six-mile radius . Why change now ? Maybe this thing with Sikes spooked him . Nothing spooked him before . The first hit , he was almost apprehended by two uniforms . The third , a clerk shot at him . Must be something more . A common denominator that has taken him outside the six-mile radius . Let 's come up with that something before all the people ... we got sleeping in convenience stores wonder what the hell it is they 're doing . I 'll have a full report on your desk in the morning . All right , what about this sector ? Would you like some more tea ? No , thanks . I 'm fine . Thanks for making dinner . Did I burn the flesh enough ? Yeah , you did fine . Thanks . Is your body sore ? Would you like for me to rub it ? No . Thanks . I just kinda want to be alone . Of course . I 'm sorry . No . Thanks for coming over and cooking and everything . It 's just been a hell of a day . A long three days . I missed you , Matt . I 'm really glad you 're home . You know , if you need ... anything . Thanks . Break . Three and two . ( CROWD CHEERING EXCITEDLY ) The ceremony will tell you many things . I don 't want to know many things . What you choose to know will become truth if you allow it in . I don 't know if I know how to do that . Many humans find it hard at first , but ... I am here to help you . Does he live here ? Can I talk to him ? Don 't think merely of this world . Release yourself and you will see clearly . I need to find the man who was at the hospital . You will find guidance . Let the spirit consume you and give you direction . Shall we prepare ourselves for transition ? Our bodies are clean and our minds are open . Now let us find the light to guide us . As we mark our bodies as Luibof guides us ... let us look into our minds to guide the hands that mark us . MATT : Dad , wait . Don 't go , Dad . I hate you . You 're not a father . You 're nobody . I hope you die . Get out of here . What are you doing ? No , Daddy . No . Dad . The sun has barely risen and you 're leaving ? Guess I 'm not Luibof material . Have we offended you ? No . It 's been a hell of a trip . But the stuff you fed me in there isn 't what I 'm looking for . What are you looking for , Mr. Sikes ? A little truth . Then let us help you . You dish up bad memories , lady . I can do that all by myself . Thanks for slipping me the rock . The great Jacques Barzun , in his deeply moving work ... God 's Country and Mine , wrote : " Whoever wants to learn the heart and mind of America ... " " had better learn baseball ... " " the rules and realities of the game . " Now , wasn 't that a wonderful thought ? Yogi Berra said , " They 're done singing , let 's get on with the game . " Really ? I hadn 't read that . So ? I made it up . Are we gonna practice or what ? I 've drawn out a complete workout schedule . However , I 'm not quite done with my opening remarks . Dad , I think everyone 's getting bored with the opening remarks . Really ? Well , then , perhaps we can move on . However , the great Tom Lasorda once said ... Lasorda sucks . Billy , how would you like to go run 150 laps ? Dad . Everyone , I want you to meet my assistant coach . Albert . Albert works with me at the station . He 's also Binnaum to my children . And he has very graciously volunteered his time . What 's a Bin Bun ? He catalyses my emission when we are going to have ... Dad , let 's move on . All right . Say hello to what 's going to be the number one Little League team . Hello . Albert has done his homework as well . And I think you 'll find him very knowledgeable about the game . As the great Jacques Barzun once wrote ... Albert , we 're moving on from the opening remarks to the drills . Very well , the Mr. Tommy Lasorda exercises ? No . We better make it Sparky Anderson . Go with a champ if you wanna be a champ . All right , everyone onto the field for calisthenics . ALBERT : Watch George . Roberto Clemente . Very good . Willie Mays . ( WHISTLE BLOWING ) All right , I thought today was an excellent beginning . I hope you did as well . Yes , just remember what Mr. Sparky Anderson says . Can we go now ? Yes ... thank you all . And I 'll ... I 'll see you next week . Why does that little boy remind me of my partner ? Dad , do you think you 're doing this right ? I don 't know . Something seems wrong , doesn 't it ? Everybody 's just doing what you say . That 's what they 're supposed to do . The coach is the leader . The one the team looks to for direction . Yeah , I guess . You don 't think that 's right ? I mean , you 're real good at explaining and everything . But ... So why can 't we hit home runs like Babe Ruth ... and steal bases like Willie Randolph ? I don 't know . I 'm sure it 's in the books . DISPATCHER : 1-William-152 . 1-William-152 . Go ahead . Your partner has requested you back at the division . Did he say why ? He 's about to roll on your 211 suspect . Put me in route . Roger . Emily , tell Albert what 's happening and to take you home . I 'm not sure how late I 'll be . Okay , Coach . Peter Rabbit . What makes you so sure he 's our man ? Just a gut feeling I 've been backing up all morning . Madison , I want you to coordinate a hit on his apartment ... in case he didn 't come to work today . Matthew , I ran these same profiles through days ago . I 've been checking each one out . I took a little shortcut and came up with something interesting . These photos that the computer kicked out ... they got a lot more baggage attached than all the others . Look at this . No record with the DMV . Means he doesn 't drive , right ? Fits right into our theory . We have another one . Outside the six-mile radius . Yeah , I saw that when I came in . So how does he get around ? This one here put us right back on square one . Hell , that 's the one that nailed our guy . Matthew , what are all these lines ? This city is a grid of routes . Bus routes , garbage routes , and look at this . Recycling routes ? Right . Look . He worked the route on the third . The noon to 6 : 00 shift . Convenience store was hit at 4 : 30 . He was probably on a break then . And then here on the seventh . The midnight shift . It all fits together , George . We got him . I 'm going to bring him in . We 're going to bring him in . Okay . Come on , Babe . Let 's hit a home run . Give me your hand . Nice work , Matthew . Yeah , thanks . What are you looking at ? Remember me ? The guy you almost killed . It 's my party now . Let 's go . I go with my own , thanks . You go with me . Matthew . Matt . Matthew . What are you doing ? We still have work to clear up here . George , I 'm a cop , all right . This is the cake we wait for . Let me take him in alone . Let me enjoy the moment . Of course . I 'll finish up here . Get a ride back with one of the patrol cars . Nice going , Matthew . Yeah , you , too . You killed me . And you brought me back . Didn 't you ? PETER : This is not the police department . Why did you bring me here ? You gonna tell me what 's going on ? I know all about you , man . I saw you . Then what are we sitting here for ? Just tell me . Tell me the truth . What you said to me . You said , " It wasn 't meant to happen . " I heard you . You can do it , can 't you ? You can bring people back to life . You can heal people . Come on , what the hell is the big secret ? You humans cannot deal with all that we have within us . I am to take from those who have more than they need ... and give it to those without food or clothing . But you broke laws . Laws on paper do not mean as much as the laws of existence . Some of us are chosen to remind the world of that . You can save us . Say it . You can bring back the dead , can 't you ? Good ... can be raised just as easily as evil . You see why the gift must be kept within ? A garbage man 's going to save the world . What did a carpenter 's son do ? Why don 't I show you ? Peter Rabbit . That 's a positive ID . ? Yes , sir . Everything in his apartment . Airline stubs , expensive clothes . All are traceable ... and seem to have been purchased on or after the date of the robberies . Our suspect led a rather cavalier lifestyle . Couple of hundred bucks here and there and he 'd blow it as fast as he stole it . That seems to be his MO . Okay , I want you to tie everything you can into the robberies . I want this guy fileted nice and neatly . Fileted ? Forget it . Where is he now ? I assume Matthew is processing him . Hasn 't been anybody through booking in an hour . Detective Francisco . Is backup rolling ? Tell them I 'm on my way . What is it ? Matthew is in pursuit . The suspect got away . There is only one way into this dead end and it 's covered . That leaves one way out . I 'm going up . Get a chopper in the air and circle the back . Matthew , what happened ? What does it look like ? The creep got away . The second he had a shot he took it . He was cuffed in the back of your car . George , we 'll talk about this later . Now , I 'm going after the son of a bitch . Talk to me now . I got other things to deal with right now . You deal with me now . George , get a shotgun and back me up . All right . ( METAL CLANKING ) Freeze , Rabbit , it 's all over . I believed you , man . Look , it 's over . I lied . I 'm just a garbage man . Matthew ! You have the right to remain silent . Get away from him , George . What are you really angry at ? Get away from him . What is it ? What is it , Matthew ? I believed him . He said he could do it . No . You wanted to believe him . I can still see him at the hospital . Touching me . Even now . How 's that for gullible ? No . He was at the airport buying a ticket to Las Vegas when you were in the E.R. Why not ? That 's perfect . It was all me . Yes , but that 's all right . Let it out , Matthew . How do you let out 25 years ? What do you mean , 25 years ? I just wanted to talk to him . Talk to whom , Matthew ? I just wanted to talk to my father . Your father died when you were a little boy . No . Yes . Yes , he did . 25 years ago . No , he didn 't . He didn 't . MATT : After he was shot , he was never really there . The past five years , he 's been like that . I 'm sorry , Matthew . He 's been dying for 25 years . And all I ever wanted him to hear ... I hated that bastard . All I ... All I ever wanted him to hear ... was I really didn 't want him to die . Tell him . Look at him . He hasn 't heard anything in a long time . Matthew , you haven 't said anything in a real long time . I want him back , George . I want to tell him . Then you must tell him . I 'll wait outside . ( MACHINE BEEPING ) Hi , Dad . I thought maybe we could ... I don 't know ... I got some things I want to say to you . So , how are we doing over here ? Real good . No problem . I got the Carew stance down . It 's your turn . Thanks . Do you want me to use the Rod Carew stance ... with the Carl Yastrzemski ? I want you to do whatever feels right inside . Really ? Even the best didn 't get there ... without making a few discoveries of their own .

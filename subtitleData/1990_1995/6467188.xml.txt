 I got your request for assistance , 50 . What is your present location ? Unit 50 , go ahead . Suspect now westbound . Has entered the gate of the shipworks off April Street . Unit 50 still in pursuit . Over . All right , Unit 50 , I copy . Keep me advised ... This is the police ! Pull your vehicle over and stop ! Stop your vehicle ! Put your hands on the roof and freeze ! Hold it ! Get on the ground ! Do it ! You hear me ? ! Face down ! Do it ! Stay down ! Unit 106 , go ahead . Stop ! Armed officer ! I hit him . I know I hit him . Where the hell did he go ? He 'd be bleeding bad . The Lipari Island group off the coast of Italy . But-but theirs is a very light lava , sir . That 's exactly what stumped me . Because inside , there must be something the weight of the heaviest rock in existence . But , Professor , that-that would be Icelandic peridotite . Precisely . There 's a piece chipped off . By me . Well , what 's the rock inside ? Icelandic peridotite , naturally . When I saw this , I stopped chipping . But how could a rock from Iceland ... Mulder . Are you watching channel eight ? ... across the world ? What 's your conclusion ? Science does not jump to conclusions . Science is not a guessing game . ... where a 60-mile high-speed car chase ended early this evening- - the suspect alluding capture by leaping into the harbor , but not before reportedly injuring several Ardis police officers . We have Captain Roy Lacerio standing by . Captain , how was the man able to escape and how seriously injured were the officers involved ? Those details are still unclear . I 'll be talking with several of the ... We need you , Captain . I 'm sorry , you 'll have to excuse me . Captain Roy Lacerio being pulled away here during an intense manhunt . No additional information has been released . ... Lacerio being pulled away here during an intense ... Mulder , you 've been through this tape 100 times . What exactly are you hoping to find ? I don 't know . And all he told you was to watch channel eight ? Yeah , that 's all he said . Do we even know why the suspect was being chased ? As far as I can tell , he wouldn 't pull over for a moving violation . Well , that ought to put him on the ten most wanted list . There 's got to be something here . Some detail- - something we 're not seeing . How do you know he 's not just yanking your chain , this Deep Throat character ? Why would he do that ? Well , he has lied to you , by his own admission . I don 't think he 'd call if there wasn 't something here- - something I 'm supposed to see , something he wants me to see . Then what are you missing ? I don 't know if you 're aware , but there were three different law enforcement agencies out here last night . Hunting a man on a moving violation ? I know it 's not Silence of the Lambs , but it 's what we do . This man in the photograph doesn 't appear to be wearing a badge or a uniform . - He 's not one of yours ? - No , sir . But , like I said , it was a zoo out here . You say the suspect was shot . Any explanation why the body hasn 't been recovered ? As you can see , we got our search ongoing . Divers down there in shifts . We 're quite certain he will be found . It 's been almost 18 hours , Captain . Where could the body be ? There are cables and debris all over the bottom . It 's a painstaking business . Can I ask what the FBI 's interest in this case would be ? The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive . Really ? How 's that ? No description of the suspect has been released . If you don 't mind , can we take a look at the car , please ? It 's been taken to impound . The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency in Gaithersburg . They had no idea the car was even missing . You know , Mulder , I think that we 're wasting our time here . I don 't know what the hell I 'm supposed to find . You can 't make out the license plate in this photo . Hey , Scully , look at this . What ? Look at the car in the photo . Look at the windshield . It 's not the same car . It 's called a caduceus . It 's sort of the adopted symbol of the medical profession . So probably only a doctor would have that on his car . Mm-hmm . I had the picture enhanced , and the plate is different . " 3 A-Y-F . " Fast-forward . That 's all you can make out ; the rest is obscured . Hey , Danny , it 's Mulder . I need you to run a Maryland plate for me . All I got is a partial . Registered to a doctor- - or used to be . Yeah , I 'll hold . They switched cars on us , Scully , and they lied about it . Why would they do that ? Maybe the real owner of the car has got something to hide . Dr. Berube ? Yes ? We 're with the FBI . Can we have a minute of your time ? - I 'm actually very busy . - I 'm sorry . Are you aware that a car registered to you was involved in a high-speed chase in Ardis yesterday ? Excuse me ? A silver Ciera , Doctor . Do you own a silver Ciera ? Yes . It was used for what ? A crime . Were you aware it was even missing ? Not until you mentioned it . I have a housekeeper , and she often uses the car . It 's a second car ... Please ! They should not be excited . Nothing should be touched . I 'm sorry , I thought they were friendly . They 're part of an experiment . What kind of experiment ? Am I under some kind of suspicion ? No . Then I think I 've answered all your questions . Now if you 'll excuse me , I have more work than time . Thank you . Did he bite you ? No , but he tried to . Well , it 's almost 5 : 00 . We should check with the doctor 's housekeeper about the car while we 're out here . No . No ? What do you mean , no ? I mean , this has reached the point of absurdity , Mulder . We 're out here on half a hunch , off of a cryptic phone call , chasing down a clue that 's based on nothing but speculation . Well , that 's all we 've got . That 's all he 's given us . Who is this Deep Throat character ? I mean , we don 't know anything about him- - what his name is , what he does . He 's in a delicate position . He has access to information , and indiscretion could expose him . You don 't know that this isn 't just a game with him . He 's toying with you . Rationing out the facts . You think he does it because he gets off on it ? No . I think he does it because you do . Calling it a night , Mr. Mulder ? My mother usually likes me home before the street lights come on . I 'm surprised at you . Why ? Your level of commitment seems to have diminished . My level of commitment ? I should 've expected that you 'd be working through the night trying to put the pieces together . Well , maybe if you 'd given me something more to work with . Under the circumstances , I 've given you all I can . A news report ? And where has it led you ? Not very far . It may be further than you realize . You know , from day one , this has always been on your terms . I 've gone along , been the dutiful son . But maybe this time we can just cut out the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap and you can save me the trouble . I fear you 've become too dependant on me . Let me tell you something . I 've got plenty to do without chasing down your vague leads or trying to decode your circular logic . Maybe it 's you who 's become too dependant on me- - on my willingness to play your games . Mr. Mulder ? What ? Don 't give up on this one . Trust me . You 've never been closer . Closer to what ? Hello ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Working late tonight , Doctor ? What do you want here ? He 's alive , isn 't he ? Has he contacted you ? Please . You 're going to have to leave . If you 're from the FBI , I 've already answered all your questions ! What questions ? I had nothing to say to them . I have nothing to say to you . Where 's Dr. Secare ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Please . My work is very important . I must get on with my work . I 'm afraid ... your work is done . Anybody see anything ? No . Nothing . That 's it , I 'm calling it off . - Let 's get those guys out of the water . - Yes , sir . Shore to RC-1 , bring it in . Visibility ... There 's nothing down there- - three days . Forget it . The county sheriff 's office is conducting the investigation . On the preliminary reports , it 's being listed as a suicide . Suicide ? Yeah , they think that , for whatever reason , he trashed his lab and then killed himself . How ? Well , it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze around his neck and the other end to this gas outlet . Then he jumped . I don 't suppose there were any witnesses . Nope . The man we met yesterday kept this place like he was waiting for the people from Good Housekeeping to show up . I would never have pegged him as someone to do this . Or a Greg Louganis out the window . I know . That gauze is troubling . It 's a bit too calculated , huh ? Almost as if someone wanted to make doubly sure he 'd break his neck before he hit the ground . What else do we know about Dr. Berube ? Um ... " Terrence Allen Berube . Harvard Med , 1974 . " He was working on the Human Genome Project . Are you familiar with that ? Yeah . The mapping of all human genes . Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor in the history of mankind . Right , but there 's nothing extraordinary about that . I mean , there were thousands of scientists working on that project . Yeah , but only one who owned a silver Ciera and went bungee jumping with medical gauze wrapped around his neck . I 'm sorry , Mulder , I 'm seeing the pieces , but I 'm not seeing the connection . Well , maybe that 's just it . Maybe we 're not seeing it because ... it can 't be seen , not in any obvious way . What do you think this is ? I don 't know . Can you find out for me ? What are you gonna do ? I 'll see what else I can find out about Dr. Terrence Allen Berube . Okay , Mulder , but I 'm warning you . If this is monkey pee , you 're on your own . Yeah . My first impression is it 's some kind of bacteria specimen . Can I ask you where you got it ? It was recovered at a crime scene . We 've come a long way from Colonel Mustard in the den with a rope , haven 't we ? I 'm expecting it 'll turn out to be nothing . No . No , you 've definitely got something here . Wow . Look at this . What are they ? Well , they 're the size of bacteria , but no bacteria I 've ever seen . How do you mean ? Well , most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth . These are ... I don 't know ... strange . You have no way of identifying them ? Well , we could do a freeze fracture . Take a thin slice off and see what 's going on inside these babies . If you don 't mind waiting . No . No , I 'll wait . Hi , Danny . Yeah , it 's Mulder again . Look , I got a number this time . 555-2804 , area code 301 . I need an address , a name if you can get it for me . All right . I 'm at , uh ... same prefix , 1517 . All right . Thanks , Danny . That was fast . Terry , is that you ? Yeah . Who 's this ? They shot me , Terry . Oh , God . I 've been in the water for three days . I 'm hurt . Where are you now ? I 'm at a pay phone . I 'm gonna pick you up . Where are you ? Terry ... Hello ? Hello ? You okay ? Are you there ? Hello ? Hello . This man 's been hurt here . I think he needs medical attention . What 's the street ? What 's the street ? I 'm going to call an ambulance . Sir ? Don 't hang up . I got it . Hi , Danny . Let me get the address . - All right , you ready ? - Let me just ... Mulder ? I 'm just writing it down now . Go ahead . All right , the number belongs to a company called Zeus Storage . 1616 Pandora Street . Yeah . 1616 Pandora Street . That 's it . All right , thanks . Okay , we 've got a white male , 40 , weak vitals , with signs of severe dyspnea and hypotension . He also what appears to be a green fluid coming from a wound in his right upper quadrant . I don 't know what the hell that is . Is he responding to ventilation ? No , and we 're noticing those rope veins at the neck and a hypersonant sounding chest . He 's going real blue on us now . Okay , you 've got a tension pneumothorax . I want you to perform a thoracotomy and release the pressure in his chest . Okay , I 'm gonna need a cannula . We 're gonna do a needle decompression . Mobile van , what 's going on ? Mobile men , can you hear me ? Mobile men , answer me ! Mobile men , what is the problem ? ! Mobile men , come in please ! Mulder . It 's me . He 's alive , Scully . Who ? The fugitive , the driver of the silver Ciera . He called the doctor 's house while I was there . Where is he now ? I don 't know . Where are you ? I 'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department . I 've got something for you . Is it smaller than a silver Ciera ? Much . And it 's not silver . It 's green . What is it ? Some kind of bacteria , each containing virus . And it looks as if Berube may have been cloning them . They also contain something that looks like chloroplasts- - plant cells . But they 've never seen anything like it here . Any idea what he could 've been doing with them ? Well , the only reason why you 'd clone a virus inside a bacteria is in order to inject it into something living . It 's called gene therapy , and it 's still highly experimental . Well , maybe that 's what he was doing with those monkeys . Can they tell you anything else there ? Yeah , they 're just about to run some primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence . Now , I may be understating the strangeness of this , Mulder . Bacteria like this- - it may have existed , but not for millions of years . Not since before our ancestors first crawled out of the sea . Are you there , Mulder ? Mulder ? Yeah . Scully , keep up the good work . Agent Scully . Oh , Dr. Carpenter , I fell asleep . I 've done some work . These are the DNA sequences from the bacteria sample you brought in . You seem to know something about molecular biology . You know what you 're looking at ? Yeah , I think those are genes . Right . They 're called base pairs . Each pair is made up of something called a nucleotide . Only four nucleotides exist in DNA- - four . And through some miracle of design that we have yet to fathom , every living thing is created out of these four basic building blocks . What you 're looking at is a sequence of genes from the bacteria sample . Normally , we 'd find no gaps in the sequence . But with these bacteria , we do . Why is that ? I don 't know why . But I tell you , under any other circumstances , my first call would have been to the government . What exactly did you find ? A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide- - a new base pair . Agent Scully , what you are looking at- - it exists nowhere in nature . It would have to be by definition ... extraterrestrial . Hello . Mulder ? Where on God 's earth have you been ? I 've been trying to call you all night . I had a situation . I left my phone in the car . Mulder ... that bacteria I had analyzed- - they 're saying that it doesn 't exist in nature . They 're saying that it could be extraterrestrial . Scully ... What ? How soon can you be here ? There 's something I got to show you . Wait a second . Mulder ... I just want to say that I was wrong . That 's all right . Don 't worry about it . No , um ... if you 'd have listened to me , we wouldn 't be here right now . I should know by now to trust your instincts . Why ? Nobody else does . You know , I 've always held science as sacred . I 've always put my trust in the accepted facts . And what I saw last night ... for the first time in my life , I don 't know what to believe . Whatever it is you do believe , Scully , when you walk into that room ... nothing sacred will hold . There were tanks here ... and five bodies suspended in solution . There were computers monitoring them . They were alive , Scully , underwater . What happened to them ? God only knows . Most likely they 've been destroyed . Miss Scully . I believe we met ever so briefly . Destroyed by whom ? I don 't know . I don 't believe you . There are limits to my knowledge , Mr. Mulder . Inside the intelligence community , there are so-called black organizations- - groups within groups conducting covert activities unknown at the highest levels of power . There were three men last night ; I was chased . If you were chased , you would have been killed . Those men are trained for that sort of business , and they are trained well . Were those the same men who killed Dr. Berube ? Presumably . Why ? Why ? Good Lord . You 've worked so hard and you still don 't see it . Dr. Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial viruses . Yes , but that 's been going on for years . We 've had the tissue since 1947 , but not the technology . Roswell ? Roswell was a smoke screen . We 've had a half a dozen better salvage operations . Dr. Berube was killed because his work was too successful . You 're standing in the room where the first DNA transplant took , the first human-alien hybrid was created . Six volunteer patients , all terminally ill . One , Dr. William Secare , an old friend of Dr. Berube 's was dying of melanoma cancer . And as a result of the E.T. gene therapy , all six patients treated in this room began to recover from their illnesses . Dr. Secare was able to live a more or less normal life- - as normal as possible for a man who has developed inhuman strength and the ability to breathe underwater . That 's how he was able to elude capture . What was he running from ? Dr. Secare was never supposed to have survived . Dr. Berube 's research was part of a top secret government project being run out of Los Alamos . All they were interested in was the technology , the science . To have a hybrid living out in the real world- - too great a liability . What if he should need emergency medical procedure ? The man has a blood chemistry that is alien and very likely toxic . That story should hit the press . It was just easier to kill Dr. Secare . Of course . Only one problem : he was Dr. Berube 's old friend . He was able to warn him . There 's just one thing I don 't understand : why you gave us so little to go on in the beginning . And why are you giving us so much now ? I didn 't anticipate the speed and precision of their clean-up operation . They 're systematically destroying all the evidence- - Dr. Berube , the bodies here . Without the evidence , you two have no case . Who would believe the story I just told you ? You must put together everything that you have found , and you must find Dr. Secare before they do . I 'll have no further contact with you on this matter . I 'm going to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work . I 'm going to find Dr. Secare . Where ? I don 't know . I 'm going to trust my instincts . Excuse me , I 'm looking for Dr. Ann Carpenter . I 've been unable to reach her by phone , and she 's not in her office . She was in a terrible car accident- - her whole family . And Dr. Carpenter is , um , dead . Dr. Secare ? Wait ! I 'll protect you . Your cellular phone 's been ringing off the hook . I 'm a popular guy . Why don 't you answer it for me ? Oh , I don 't like talking on the phone . I have this thing about unsecured lines . When you feel like talking , let me know , though . He 's not home . Where is he ? He 's been gone all night . I wish I knew . Something 's happened to him . They won 't kill him . How do you know that ? He 's become too high-profile , and you 've got evidence that could expose them . I don 't have any evidence ; they took the evidence , and they may have killed in order to get it . Listen to me . - Evidence still exists . - Where ? It might be difficult to obtain , but with your medical background , I might be able to get you inside . Inside where ? High containment facility , Fort Marlene , Maryland . What do they have there ? The wellspring , Miss Scully- - the original tissue . If they 've got Agent Mulder , they might be willing to make a deal . It could save his life . Clear . Name ? Dana Scully . Company or institution ? Federal government . Project password ? Project password ? Purity control . Log in , please . You 're late . Do you have it ? Yes . Good . They 're willing to make the exchange . You spoke to them ? Yes . I 'll take the parcel . No , sir . I 'll make the exchange . I made the deal , Scully . They 're expecting me . I don 't trust you . You 've got no one else to trust . I don 't know who you are . I know nothing about you . Oh , for God 's sake , don 't screw this up ! Let me tell you something you should know . In 1987 , a group of children from a Southern state were given what their parents thought was a routine inoculation . What they were injected with was a clone DNA from the contents of that package you 're holding as a test . That 's the kind of people you 're dealing with . So , why give it back to them ? To save Mulder 's life . At the risk of so many other lives ? It 's the tip of the iceberg . You and Mulder are the only ones who can bring it to light . Now , give me the parcel . Give me the parcel , Scully . No ! Mulder . Mulder . Trust ... Trust ... no one . Hello . Hey , Scully , it 's me . Where are you ? They 're shutting us down , Scully . What ? They called me in tonight , and they said they 're going to reassign us to other sections . Who told you that ? Skinner . He said word came down from the top of the executive branch . Mulder ... It 's over , Scully . Well , you have to lodge a protest . They can 't ... Yes , they can . What are you going to do ? I 'm not going to give up . I can 't give up . Not as long as the truth is out there .

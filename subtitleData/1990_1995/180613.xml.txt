 Come in . Devon . Anybody . Oh . Where am I ? Where am I ? Eden Project , can you hear me ? It 's Danziger . I 'm lost . [ Panting ] My gear compass is down . No coordinates . This windstorm 's got me all turned around . Ah , come back . Come on . Oh , you 've done it this time , Johnny . Oh , you 've done it this time . Where are they ? Where am I ? Hey ! Hey ! Who is he ? Who is he ? I don 't know , but he 's very sick . Help me . Shelter . Adair . Come in , Devon . Devon . Come in , Devon . - " Go . ! Go . ! Go . ! " - Devon . Devon . [ Panting ] Ohh ! I 'm sorry , Katrina . Governor . Governor . Your Devon , she 's come . She 's here , sir . [ Bird Cawing ] [ Julia ] He was supposed to be scouting for food . We lost him about 1800 hours last night . And of course , we can 't get him on gear . [ Yale ] Okay . John has been known to turn offhis gear hours at a time . But that storm , Yale . He is out there . And think about how cold it is inside . [ Door Opens ] No sign . Nothing . Shankin ' freezing out there . Anything from him over gear while we were gone ? No . I 'm gonna get insulated . It 's my turn to search . Okay , people , most likelyJohn has taken refuge somewhere to wait out the storm . But the storm ended last night , Yale . Yes . Y-Yes , it did , True . But your daddy is a very smart man . I know he can take care of himself . But where is he ? He said he 'd only be gone for a couple hours . He was just going out scouting . Come on , True . You and I are gonna go get some breakfast . And you 'll see-Your daddy is gonna come walking through that door any second , all right ? Come on . Let 's go . [ Moans ] Alonzo . Alonzo , come on , get up . Danziger 's missing . You 're coming with me . Devon , you 've come . Devon . No , it 's Julia . You having a dream ? She has to go alone . What are you talking about ? He 's all right , but Devon has to go looking for him alone . He 's sick . What do you mean he 's sick ? Is it the Terrians ? Do they have him ? No . I mean , I don 't think so . Yes , I did have a dream . Well , then , if he 's sick , then I have to go - No ! No , she has to go alone . That was the message I got . And they won 't hurt her , as long as she goes alone . That is it . That 's all I dreamt . [ Men Chattering ] Wh-Where am I ? Where am I ? What - Couldn 't leave you out there in that traffic . Not safe . Everyone glaring at you . [ Chuckles ] You 'd never recuperate out there . Who are you ? [ Chuckles ] You really have caught the fever , haven 't you ? Fool - No one stays above in this cold . It 's lucky we found you . Ter-Where am I ? Terrians . Where am I ? It 's all right . It 's all right . They 're sleeping . This is their space . We 're only visitors . [ Moans ] Now , shush , shush , shush . Now , hush , now . You need to rest , as well . - And I must excuse myself . - Where are you going ? Well , I have to wish my granddaughter pleasant dreams . Your granddaughter ? Where is she ? Back on the space stations . [ Beeping ] Yale ? Yale , you there ? Yes , Devon , I have you . I made it . I 'm , uh , where Alonzo said . Five degrees west , top of the mesa . [ Yale ] I don 't like this , the Terrians wanting you alone . Alonzo didn 't say anything about the Terrians . Keep your weapon handy . No sign of anything , Yale . I , uh , I 'm gonna sign off . If nothing happens within the hour , we 'll figure out our next move , okay ? [ Beeps ] [ Clanking ] Hello ? Danziger ? Hello , Danziger ? [ Clanking ] Who is that ? It 's me . True ! True , you cannot be here . What - I wanted to help you find Dad . They will only come if I 'm alone , you understand ? I told you that , True . I 'm sorry . [ Sighs ] I 'm calling camp and telling them that I 'm bringing you right back , all right ? [ Sighs ] [ Static ] Devon . Oh , her name is True . She , uh , she just wants her father . Um - Look , she won 't be any trouble . Please . Come on . [ Men Chattering ] [ Chattering ] Where 's Danziger ? - Who are you ? - " [ Boy ] T 'was him , ma 'am . " He brought you here . He sent for you across the heavens . I came for Danziger . He 's one of our group . In - In - In a dream , somehow , we were told he was here . It 's all right . Whatever you have to say , you can say in front of her . It 's okay . I 'll take her . She 'll be safe . Okay . All right , we 're alone now . Look at you . You 're so young . What ? I 'm young ? Ulysses - Did he survive ? How do you know my son 's name ? I know a lot of things about you , Devon . That your mother died when you were 18 . That you 're afraid of the dark . That you haven 't had a lover since Uly was born . Who the hell are you ? Don 't you remember , Devon ? It 's me . Sheppard . We know each other . No . No , I don 't know you . Where 's Danziger ? What have you done with him ? What have you done with him ? He 's safe . I 'll find him myself . Danziger ! Danziger ! [ True ] Devon . ! Devon , this way . ! Where ? We 're in here . Devon . Devon . Oh , God . True , we 've got to get out of here . We 've got to get back to camp . Where are we ? Oh , my God , you 're on fire . He 's so sick . What happened ? What have they done to you ? Nothing . Trying to help . No . No . No , John . We 've got to get out of here . Something is terribly wrong . Look , just let me rest a little longer . No , we cannot stay here , John . There is a man here . He has a scar and a patch on his eye . Have you spoken to him ? Man ... patch . I don 't - He knows things about me , John . Did you tell him anything about me , about Uly ? - Oh , I don 't know . - What do you mean , Devon ? - Think , John , think ! - " Danziger cannot help you , miss . " You are the one who knows him . Who are you ? I 'm a friend . But he 's something more . He 's greater than that . There 's no call for you to be afraid of him . Rest your mind , child . Think . Do you not know his face ? His eyes ? His voice ? No . No , I don 't . I don 't know him . I 'm sorry . I - I 'm sorry . I really wish I could help you people , but maybe , uh , maybe you think I 'm someone I 'm not . Come on , True . Come on , Danziger . We have to get out of here . Now , come on . Get up . Come on . I cannot allow you to take him . I 'm sorry . He 's too weak . Try to have faith , Devon . You 're quite safe here . [ Static ] Yale ? Yale , come in . This is Devon . Anybody . Is anybody there ? Hello ! That will not work down here . But I will contact your party . Ohh ! They 're okay , all of them . And True is with them . You had another dream ? Yeah . Is it the Terrians ? I don 't know . It seems like Terrians , but it 's not . [ Morgan ] What 's that supposed to mean ? You seem coherent , but you 're not . Morgan , there 's human emotions behind the dreams , real communications , you know ? I mean , look , the message I got from the dreams ... is that Devon and True are okay - they 're all being taken care of . - We have got to go and get them . - No , you can 't . You won 't be able to find them , no matter how hard you look . They 're all in good hands . I can feel it . Whoever has them will never let danger come . That much is clear . You were hungry . It 's kinda good . So , what is this place ? An old Terrian cave or something ? It 's the underground . We all live here together - Terrians , humans . We all share it . You mean you live here , like , all the time ? Where else would we go ? I don 't know . Over ground . Up on top . No , not safe . Look what happened to your man Danziger . Down here , we are safe and warm and good . Governor takes care of us . Who ? Sheppard , the man in the chamber . The one who sent for her . He looks after us all . He can look after you too . No . My dad looks after me . Your dad ? Yeah , my father . The man who brought me into the world . Don 't you have a dad ? I guess one of them must be . That 's not so important down here . Come on . You wanna see something ? Sure . I 'm glad you came back , Devon . Who are you ? Did we meet ? When I was a child maybe ? Did you know my parents ? No . I 'm a penal colonist . I 've been here a long , long time . I was sent here for my crimes . Then how do you know me ? How could we possibly have met ? The Terrians took me in . They thought I was redeemable . Actually , they took all of us in , the ones who were exiled with me , others who followed . But how do you know me ? Come winter , an amazing thing happened . As they hibernated , the Terrians opened their dreamscape to us . Their minds are like vessels that can transport you anywhere . We could dream ourselves anywhere . We dreamed ourselves home , Devon . Back across the universe to the space stations . Each of us to visit their loved ones ... while they slept . Why are you telling me this ? Well , I didn 't have any loved ones . But I went back anyway . And in my dream ... I met you . Me ? We didn 't meet . I 'm sorry . We-We didn 't . Oh , my God . Sheppard , it 's you . You " do " remember . You do . You 're him . You 're the man from my dreams . You 're the voice that told me to come here . Tell me about Uly . He 's , uh - Yes , he , uh - The Terrians healed him just - Oh , my God . Just like you said . You saved my son 's life . You saved him . You got him here . You 're real . I didn 't just dream you , did I ? You exist . I 've waited for decades to touch your face . I thought I had lost you . That you would never come . I made it . Have they given you enough blankets ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm burning up now . You were calling Devon Adair by name when you were brought in . Yeah . [ Sighs ] You must have been through a great deal together , you and Devon . Yeah , I suppose we have . What are you getting at , pal ? Sorry for bothering you . [ True ] What is it ? Some kind ofbed or something ? [ Boy ] She sleeps in it every night . Who ? Haven 't you seen her yet ? Katrina , the ancient lady . She never talks to anyone , but watches everything . Been here since the beginning . Maybe we should get out of here . They say it comes from the land before here . You mean the space stations ? Do you know it ? That 's where I 'm from . You come from the land before here ? But you 're so little . Only the old people come from there . - What are you doing here ? - N-Nothing . - She speaks . - Who invited you under ? 'Twas Governor , ma 'am . It 's okay . She 's my friend . Sheppard said they can come down . Sheppard ? Sheppard . You must be very careful of him , little one . He tells terrible lies . He has done unspeakable things . He has committed crimes . Atrocities against humanity . You will never know a more terrible man . He has the blackest heart , the coldest blood , the hands of a murderer . Dad ! What , angel ? We have to get out of here . We can 't stay . We 're in danger . What are you talking about ? That man , the one called Sheppard ? He 's a monster , done horrible things . Where 's Devon ? I don 't know . Where 's Devon ? We have to find her before something happens . [ Beeps ] Eden Project , this is Devon . Come in , Eden Project . Eden Project , can you hear me ? Anybody there ? [ Beeps ] Uh , Devon , I 'm here . Where are you ? Is someone holding you against your will ? No . Not at all , and I 'm fine . How 's Uly ? Oh , he 's fine . Good . Well , there are humans here , uh , a sort of community , and they 've been very good to us . Okay . So we 'll come and get you now . No ! No , I mean , uh , Danziger is still sick , and he can 't travel . Don 't worry . We 'll be home soon . I see a mesa behind you . Devon , how close ... are you to those mountains ? What 's going on there ? What-What aren 't you telling me ? I 'm fine . We 're fine . What have you told Uly ? Only what we gleaned from Alonzo 's dreams , that you 're safe and no one should come for you . And it 's true . Give Uly a kiss from me . And tell him that his mother 's doing something very important ... and that I 'll be home soon . Devon , please ! Devon ! This is a very strange place , Dad . Yeah . Hey , you shouldn 't be out of bed . It 's okay . I 'm feeling stronger . You want to give us a second , okay ? Okay . I 'll be close by . Good girl . Time to move out , Adair . Oh , no . Not until you 're better . I got to talk to you about something . Okay . I have to talk to you about something too . Okay . The man I asked you about , Sheppard , the one with the eye patch . Yes , exactly . Well , I was wrong about him . I was wrong to be frightened . It 's so strange . We have this bond , like we 've known each other forever . You haven 't known him forever , Devon . You just met him . I 'm asking him to come with us . No . No , no , no . I 'm not here to ask your permission . That guy 's coming nowhere near us . He was sent here as a criminal . Thirty years ago . Come on , he has tried to make amends . He has - For murder . You know that ? He 's a psychopath , Adair . He kills people in cold blood . You have no idea what you 're talking about . - True got his whole story . - Well , True must have gotten it wrong . Have you gone crazy ? He is not coming with us ! Now we 're leaving . We gotta get you away from that dirtbag . I am not going anywhere . If you want to leave , that 's your business , but you will leave without me . How 's your friend ? He 's okay . What brought you here , Sheppard ? Please tell me why you 're here . I need to know the truth . You know already . You killed people . Mm . Why ? [ Chuckles ] I had a sister . A twin sister . [ Chuckles ] No two siblings were ever closer . We made a pact to always stay together . Devon , have you ever been in the presence of true evil ? As we grew up , she grew darker . She got involved in black magic . She even learned how to darken my heart . I have spent 30 years seeking amends . I don 't know if it 's enough . - Why did you pick me ? - What ? Out of all the women on the stations , why did you dream to me ? I heard your cry . I had to come . How do you know whether it 's day or night ? That isn 't so important down here . You know , it 's all starting to come back to me . But it 's , uh , it 's not like normal memories . I just - I just remember how you made me feel not so alone , like - like you were guiding me through decisions . A long time ago , wasn 't it ? [ Chuckles ] Not for me . I 've spent a good part of the last 23 years in cold sleep , so - I didn 't . What are you saying ? I 'm not the same man from those dreams . I 'm older , scarred by the life down here . [ Chuckles ] How did that happen ? An accident , a long time ago . Life on this planet can be difficult . Well , I 'd like to help make your life better . I 'd like you to come with us . What is it ? No way ! There is no way we can discuss this . Well , I-I have to . I mean , I do have to leave . Uly 's waiting for me . We are meeting that colony ship at New Pacifica . Please , stop , Devon ! I can 't come with you ! [ Men Yelling , Indistinct ] - Stop it ! - [ Yelling Stops ] Let go of each other . Ivan , Larken . What am I supposed to do with you ? Governor , don 't send us out . I let my temper get the best of me . Violence is forbidden . The Terrians can purge us out ofhere . We 're guests . You know that , Ivan . He knows , sir . So do I. [ Chattering ] Devon ? [ Sheppard ] Why can 't you be reasonable ? [ Katrina ] You can 't go , Sheppard . [ Sheppard ] I have done my time with you . You can live here . You don 't need me . That 's for me to say . I have been very tolerant of your visitors . Don 't worry . Nothing will change . I hope not . You made a pledge , Sheppard . I would hate to have to put out your other eye . They will leave as soon as that man is well . [ Katrina ] Good . You shouldn 't be out of bed . I was looking for Devon . She isn 't here . Who 's that old lady ? What are they talking about ? What , uh , did you hear ? Well , something about him coming with us , and she doesn 't want him to go . And I gotta tell you , I couldn 't agree more . Now don 't judge Sheppard too harshly , John . He 's a good man . You don 't know the truth about him . I know all I need to know . Something 's not right with him , the way he 's messing with Devon 's head . And he knows I got his number too . He can 't even look me in the eye . That 's not why he won 't look at you , John . No ? The reason he won 't meet your eyes is because he knows . He knows ... you 're in love with her . In love ? Who am I in love with ? Go back to bed , John . Wh - [ Scoffs ] [ Woman ] Sheppard ? [ Sheppard , Indistinct ] [ Sheppard ] Devon . Where are you ? I can 't see you . I 'm right here . It feels so different in here . I 'm afraid . Afraid ? To say good-bye . To lose you now that I finally found you . Devon , I 'm not here to say good-bye . You 're not ? Forgive the reaction in my chamber , Devon , but I couldn 't speak of leaving , not there . There are things that can 't even be mentioned outside of your mind 's eye . Do you understand what I 'm saying , Devon ? Do you ? The choice has been difficult . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Yes , Devon . I am going to make thejourney with you . Tomorrow I 'll meet you up above . But don 't these people need you here ? The elder can lead them . They can survive without me . All they want is what I want - a place to feel safe . The only place I feel safe ... is with you . You mustn 't tell a soul about my coming , Devon . Swear it . Not even Danziger . All right , but why ? Because years ago I made a pledge that I would always stay by her side . Whose side ? My sister . She is here , Devon . In the caves ? We were jettisoned here together , but her sleep capsule malfunctioned . The rest of us , we didn 't age . When she woke up , she was old . She thought she 'd lost everything - her youth , her beauty . She made me swear on blood she would never lose me . Who is she ? Her name is Katrina . True . ! True . ! What ? What is it ? You 'll be going soon . You 'll be leaving me . How do you know ? I heard them talking , Sheppard and your lady . You 'll be leaving me tomorrow . You , Sheppard , Devon , the man , you all will be leaving me . I 'll be missing you , True girl . - I 'll miss you too . - Oh , what a pretty picture . - You . - You shouldn 't be looking at an old woman that way , child . You will take years off my life . So you 're leaving . Not that I don 't love it here . The rest did you well . One must be careful up there in the cold . I 'll keep that in mind . Shame you won 't be joining us . Mm-hmm . Danziger , I want you to make me one promise . I don 't make promises . No matter what happens , take care of Devon . I take care of all my friends . Hmm . [ Devon ] So - you ready to go ? Yeah . Good . Very well then , the elder will show you the way out . Thank you for everything . I thought you said you weren 't leaving without that guy . Yes , well , uh , things change . Bundle yourself up , will you , John ? Otherwise , next time , I 'm going to leave you to freeze out there . I 'll take better care . Good-bye , little missy . Good-bye . You 've got a great place down here . [ Chuckles ] I 'm glad you two found each other . Me too . Thank you . Come on . Let 's go . J - Just wait a second . We , uh , we can 't go yet . Aw , come on , let 's get outta here . It 's freezing . I don 't see him , Devon . Who ? You don 't see who , True ? Sheppard . Isn 't he coming with us ? [ Danziger ] What are you talking about ? How did you know that , True ? The little boy told me he was coming . The boy ? How did he know that ? I don 't know . Did he tell anyone else ? What 's this about ? Could anyone else have heard him , True ? Katrina , the old lady , she was in the shadows . Devon , we agreed he wasn 't coming with us . Stay here . Hey , what are you doing ? Hey , he 's in danger . I 'm gonna go find him . No way ! We decided we 're gonna go back to camp . We made it out of there . Listen to me . Trust me . I know what I 'm doing . Stay here with True . Start up the dune-rail . I 'll be fine . I 'll be right back . [ Thump ] Sheppard . Sheppard . What are you doing down here ? Thank God it 's you . It 's Katrina . She knows . She heard everything . We 've got to get you out of here . It isn 't safe . Come on . Go . Go . - [ Yells ] - [ Screaming ] You thought you could come and steal my brother from me . Well , he 's not yours . ! You followed him through the galaxy ! You want to be together ? Then die together ! Sheppard . Sheppard . Sheppard . Sheppard . Sheppard . You came to me . I did . I did . I did . We found each other . We found each other . He 'll find you , Devon . He 'll find you ... again . You think she 'll be okay , Dad ? We 'll make sure of it , True girl . I 'm glad you 're home , Mom . Me too , Uly . Me too . I just wish you could have met him .

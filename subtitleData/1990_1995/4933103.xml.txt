 [ Woman ] My earliest memories of it were the stories , how it was once thought so vast - infinite skies , deep seas , boundless mountain ranges . But they were only stories . I was born on the stations , just like my parents ... and their parents before them . It 's the only life I 've ever known . But I still think about those stories of Earth . And I tell them to my son as we prepare to flee this life of ours on the stations , a life that is ordered , efficient , sterile ... and , for a small group of children , deadly . My son is one of the unlucky ones . He was born with the Syndrome . Ulysses , are you listening ? Do you think when we get to the planet , I 'll be able to , you know , like , run right out of the ship ? No . Not right out of the ship , but in time . Now , may we please continue with our geography ? [ Woman Narrating ] Six years ago , Uly was diagnosed with a disease ... our medical community hesitates to even recognize , a disease not caused by the presence of a virus , but , rather , an absence - an absence of what nature can provide , an absence of fresh air , of fresh water , New Pacifica is bordered on the west ... by the Sea of Antaeus . an absence of Earth . And it is on this shoreline we 'll be landing . Are there going to be beasts on the planet , Mom ? - What kind of beasts , Uly ? - I don 't know . Big . Bigger than this whole ship . And skin like - like the elephant from my virtual reality , with teeth and tusks that shoot out from his face ... like , you know , tentacles ? [ Coughing ] And-And at the end of each tentacle , hands with nine fingers . You think there 'll be any monsters like that on the new planet ? I certainly hope not , Uly . Now , it 's time for you to get some rest , all right ? We have a very , " very " big day tomorrow . Hmm . Can I sit by the pilot when we launch ? Yes , if you 're quiet . Okay ? [ Beeping ] - Yes ? - Big fire , Dev . Cockpit . I 'm putting my son to bed , Commander . - Can 't wait . I need you now . - Okay . I will be right back , all right ? When I come back , I am gonna tell you a long , scary story . [ Devon Narrating ] This quest to save my son has grown larger than even I could imagine . Tonight , 250 Syndrome families wait with us , docked beside our small advance ship . In eight hours , our lives will change forever , as we light out in search of a place like Earth once was , a place where children can thrive , a planet we might call home . What ? What is it ? Something you should see . Picked up from - [ Indistinct ] [ Woman 's Voice ] Ms. Adair 's private expedition had been in the planning stages for six years , despite virulent opposition from both medical and scientific fields . Internet satellite ? To repeat , the Eden Project , bound to set up the first colony in the G8 system , met with disaster this morning , exploding upon departure . There were no survivors . [ Scoffs ] What ? What is this , some kind of a joke ? It 's government-released , Adair . Preapproved by three panels nine hours before broadcast . No jokes . Coded for 0900 hours tomorrow morning . That 's an hour after we launch . That 's right . They-They 've given up trying to stall us , so now they 're just going to kill us ? They 're going to try . We find a better world out there than these sanitized cans , they lose control . I 'm running a resonant scan of the entire ship right now . - You think there 's explosives on board ? - You don 't ? We cannot risk another delay . There are over 200 Syndrome families on the colony ship , prepping for cold sleep right now . No delays . We 'll launch on schedule . No . No , we need to launch now . - Solace , what 's our status ? - We 're at zero minus eight and a half hours . You weren 't hired to tell me the time , Ace . - " Portal 's yawning wide open . " I 'd say they 're expecting a freighter . - Now you 're talkin ' . - Advise colony . We 're moving . - Yes , sir ! - Baines ! - Yeah . - Get the operations crew together . - Right . We 're on a tight departure . Dad ? Dad ! Hey , Dad ? Over here , sweetheart . Dad , we 're moving . Yeah , it feels like it . What 's up , baby ? They 're looking for you . Uh-oh . Let 's go . Resonant scan came up with 97 non-registered items . We need a physical scan of all specified areas immediately . - Explosive check and launching at the same time ? - Just find it ! Let 's go . [ Man On P.A. ] Colony ship on approach . [ Woman On P.A. ] Colony ship - [ Indistinct ] Hospital ward reports all 248 Syndrome children are secured . Brace yourself , Sheila . We 'rejust about to kiss you here . [ Man On P.A. : Indistinct ] Engaging . Accelerating . [ Sheila ] Initial contact . [ Metal Clanging ] We have coupling . Smooth as always , Mr. Solace . Eden Advance , this is Port Control 1-9 . Please advise . We 're showing a no-go . Just stretching our legs , 1-9 . Getting in position for manana . What the hell is going on ? What the " hell " is going on ? What the - What 's going on here ? You 're our government liaison , Martin . Why the hell don 't you tell us ? What is he talking about ? Who authorized our departure ? We don 't have level six clearance yet . Eden ships , you are in violation of port ordinance . Acknowledge . Will someone with some weight talk to these nice folks , please ? If you 're still on board , Mr. Martin , I assume you have no idea what your friends on level six have planned for us tomorrow . Well , they 're releasing us to planet G889 . Guess again . Solace ! Are you out of your mind ? You 're not one of these lunatics . Orient and redock before they take your charter bars . You wanna pay my freight , 1-9 ? I kinda doubt you can match these people 's credit weight . Well , I just may retire off this run . What do you say ? Eden Advance , we still show no-go . Return to dock facility . Repeat : We will contact Port Authority . Feel free to contact whoever you damn well please . We 're making a run for it . [ Female Computer Voice ] Bay two portal doors are now closing . Bay two portal doors are now closing . If you could just tell me what you 're looking for , maybe I could help you . Ma 'am , what is this ? It 's - It 's my husband 's . No triggers . Opening item check number 19 . Well , the case is his , but , sir , the contents are mine . Government quarter sector three clear . Anything ? Nah . Negative . I 'm up to comm deck . Those doors won 't reverse , Solace . We 're shutting down Apex guidance . Now , when was the last time you piloted manual , Lonz ? [ Female Computer Voice ] Apex guidance system is off . [ Man ] You breach that hull , and we 'll have a hell of a mess on our hands . Thanks for the vote of confidence , 1-9 . I 'll keep that in mind . Okay , Ace . Now 's the time . You as good as you say you are ? Show me . Nav , I need vertical marker positioning right now . Inside the launch tube ? Without Apex ? - " [ Alonzo ] Just follow my marks . " - " Okay . " Retros at 50 % . Check . - " [ Alonzo ] Auto-positional . " - " [ Man ] Where are we going , Devon ? " [ Alonzo ] I want positioning feeds from you at five-second intervals . You got it ? [ Navigator ] Got it . Let 's do it . Well , well , well . Look at all this activity . [ Alonzo ] Stay on line here . Mr. Blalock , sir . Morgan Martin , level four . I just wanted you to realize that I , in no way , sanctioned this - Blalock , go back to sleep . You 'rejust having a bad dream . You have a scheduled departure in eight hours , Devon . Movement like this could put your clearance at risk . All these years of planning , Devon . All those obstacles . - Three degrees . Mark it . - Mark . [ Grunts ] I know we 've been difficult , but now , eight hours to go , and this final insubordinate act ? Let 's just say after all the years of clearance stalls , I 've grown just a tad antsy . Devon , everything we 've done has been for your benefit , to protect " you " from the unknown . Oh , come on , Blalock . You 've seen the probe info . The planet has a habitability rating of 83 . [ Blalock ] No human has ever been as far as G889 , Devon . - " Personally - " - Keep him on the hook , Adair . Keep him talking . Think I 'd like staying on the stations , Dison ? Syndrome children are dying . Two generations , we may all be extinct . [ Instrument Squealing ] [ Alonzo ] Okay . Stay on it . Devon , no one 's more sorry than I am ... that your little boy is sick . It is sad when children die . People have always died . Doesn 't mean we have to run away from all we know . You 've put years of work into this , Devon . Why see it all come to a halt now ? You 've got 250 people counting on you , counting on both of us ... Oh , my God . - They 're gonna kill us . - to do the right thing here . What 's the point , Dison ? I thought we had clearance . Everything but level six , Devon . You know that . - We 're off . Dead center . - Bring it up to seven . I want speed now . Devon , you know as well as I do ... there are people who do not want you to succeed . Keep him cool , Adair . We need some time . [ Blalock ] I know who they are . [ Blalock ] " You are playing " right into their hands . Two little ships , Dison . A handful of unwanted , whispered-about families . - Most people would think of this as a cleansing . - Please , God ! Were it up to me , I 'd have let you leave long ago . This is a difficult situation , rife with internal politics , Devon ! No Syndrome child has lived beyond nine years . My son is eight , and I will not watch him die . [ Female Computer Voice ] Bay two portal doors are clear . [ Both Sighing ] Nice work . [ Blalock ] We need a few more months , a few more weeks ... to establish the habitability of G889 . Do not leave station subspace ... for your own good . I cannot stress how serious this is . Why , Dison ? Are you trying to tell me something ? Are you saying I 'm at risk ? Devon , you 're at risk anytime you 're out there without us . I can 't protect you , Devon . I cannot protect you . - [ O 'Neill On Headset ] We 're clear . - You gotta trust me on this , Devon . I 'm trying to help you here . I am trying to be a friend . One thing I 've learned , Dison - I 'm all out of friends . Don 't go off-line ! I wish you would listen to me ! Hello ? How long before they realize they didn 't get us ? [ O 'Neill On Headset ] Oh , I 'd say they know now . We 're already dead to them , Dev . They 're probably firing up that newscast as we speak . We 're on our own now . No turning back . [ Navigator ] Scanners show no station activity . They 're not coming after us . Just get us out of here . Yale , where 's Dr. Vasquez ? I can 't get him on gear , and he should be prepping Uly right now . Devon , Vasquez is not on board . What ? Apparently , he went to make a final check on the children on colony . But we had boarded for departure . Nobody was supposed to disembark without proper - Oh , my God . We have no doctor , Yale . Dr. Heller is on board . Dr. Heller ? Come on . She is the most junior member of his team . She 's barely qualified to be his intern . Dr. Heller has come to prep Uly for cold sleep . I should monitor him for 24 hours before the rest of us go down for hibernation . I agree . And , uh , you should get started . I assume Dr. Vasquez has explained ... the risks a child like Ulysses faces going into cold sleep , even under optimum conditions . I 'm well aware of the risks . We don 't have very much choice now , do we ? No , we don 't . You can tell everyone from mechanical to kitchen crew we stick with the original contract - transport to and deposit on planet . I 'm not asking for the crew . I 'm asking for myself . The contract said nothing about bomb scans or leaving under a no-go . Look , even after I drop you off , I still gotta come back here and do business with that port . Okay , let 's see . Twenty-two light-years each way . How many administrations you think that 'll be ? Just tell everyone hazard pay clause has been invoked . Thank you . Good . That 's all I wanted to know . I - All right . " Eden Advance , " colony ship prepped for disengage . Tell those passengers of yours to hang tight . By the time they 're out of cold sleep , we 'll have set up their new home in New Pacifica . [ Sheila On Radio ] Twenty-four years of sleep ? We can sure use it . Thanks for the push , boys . Hope you all sleep tight . You 're breaking my heart , Sheila . I wish we could bring you along . I love you , champ . I - I won 't wake up for 22 years , but it 'll seem like tomorrow , right ? Just like any other night . You don 't think I won 't wake up , do you ? You will wake up , Uly . I promise . And when you do , we 're gonna be on the verge of a whole new life . And then you can finish telling me that story with that beast of yours , okay ? I will . [ Device Hisses ] [ Whispering ] Night , Uly . Night . I love you , Mom . [ Mouthing Words ] [ Panel Beeps ] [ Devon Narrating ] We bring so many questions with us . Will this new planet hold the key to healing humanity ? Will the frontier hold the same promise it did for our ancestors ? And , most of all , will Uly ever get to slay his monsters ? [ Female Computer Voice ] Artificial gravity restoration : active . Atmospheric repressurization : active . Automatic pilot self-check : in progress . Artificial life-support system : check . Cryo-sleep chamber four . Heller , Julia . Physician . Neurological activity : high . Core temperature : normal . Alpha rising : .8 . [ Beeping ] Isn 't standard operation to have me verify position ... so you and I can hop back in a big sack if we 're a couple hundred million miles off course ? That 's right . Well , you 'll be happy to know that my record 's intact . I haven 't missed yet . Okay . [ Beeping ] I could postpone everyone 's defrost and celebrate life a little bit . What do you say ? Is that the only come-on you sleep jumpers can come up with these days ? You 've worked cold-sleep runs ? Well , let 's just say your reputation precedes you . I don 't have one . I 'm not around enough to make one . But you - You have some sleep in your eye . What ? [ Grunts ] Oh , man , oh , man . [ Giggling ] Oh , man . Lonz , tell me I can go back to bed . Sorry , pal . We 're right on course . I win the betting pool . Tell your guys to fork over . What are you , a morning person ? Hey , you know , 22 years is a drag , huh ? First cold sleep ? No , third . Never more than 19 months though . [ Groans ] I had some kind of weird dream or something . Not me , pal . I been under so many times , I lost my dream button . Never really get used to how the world changes though . One long night 's sleep , everything you knew ... almost a quarter of a century older . Probably a grandmother now . So that 's why we get the heavy pay , huh ? How old are you , man ? A lot older than you , kid . He 's still under 97 . That 's fine . Well , he should be responding by now . Cardiorespiratory 's improving . E.E.G. ' s on target . I think a stimulant is indicated . Devon , I do know what I 'm doing . Before apprenticing with Dr. Vasquez , I - You graduated cum laude in diagnostic analysis . I checked . Then you must also know that my parents had my chromosomes skewed towards the medical arts . Your background compensates for your lack of experience , but right now my son is - [ Coughing ] Uly ? Uly ? Uly , honey , I 'm here . I 'm right here . - Are we there yet ? - Almost . We 're almost there , honey . Almost there . [ Man ] ... any assigned held pods on B-4 should report there within an hour . [ Woman ] Where should I store this ? Copy . Hey . True , sweetheart . Come on . You gotta buzz your teeth . Need your help up top . I 'm getting a cat , right ? I had a dream I got my cat . Real cat ? Did you dream we won the trans-station lottery ? Hey . You promised . You said we 're gonna be richer . I know , but I didn 't say we were gonna be billionaires . You know how much a pet allotment costs ? Come on . I 'll meet you up top . Let me make this clear , Dad . After we go drop them off , and we get home , I get a cat . Not a cheapo synth cat . A real cat . No discussion . Understand ? Well ? Good . So I 'll meet you on deck . [ Woman ] Thank you . And what time do you wanna meet for dinner ? [ Man ] 0800 hours . Geez , I can 't believe we 're actually doing this , Bess . I mean , I hate travel . I hate that Devon woman . Miss Stop-The-World-My-Son-Is-Sick , My-Cyborg-Tutor-And-I-Want-To-Get-Off . I mean , what pretension ! Oh , how could I have been so stupid ? Bess , what are you looking at ? I feel older , Morgan . Well , you 're not . We 've been over this a million times , Bess . We were in suspended animation , remember ? We don 't age . It 's impossible . All right ? I didn 't say I " was " older . I said I " feel " older . And you can 't suspend feelings . [ Man On P.A. ] Technician Flores , report to station blue . Technician Flores , report to station blue . Bess , I 'm - I 'm sorry . I - I 've been under a lot of pressure lately . Bess , you know you 're my whole world . [ Beeping ] [ Rhythmic Hissing ] - Please don 't stare at me . - I 'm not . Uly , don 't wear yourself out now . Well , hello . We 'd heard there was another child on board . My dad said they stopped the Yale program , that you all went crazy . [ Man ] Check systems two through 10 . A few of the Yales did have faint recall of their criminal past . He doesn 't have a memory glitch . [ Chuckling ] He 's a great tutor . [ Yale Chuckling ] Well , I 'm sorry that we are parting ways at G889 . We all could have gotten to know one another . Take a look . [ O 'Neill ] Just what you wanted , Dev . A new place to call home . We made it . [ Whispering ] We 're on the other side of the stars . [ Female Computer Voice ] Advance " communication dish launched . " Okay , easy does it there , girl . Drag and stage . Propulsion shift . [ Laughing ] Yes ! Hey , Ace . You put this cargo down as nicely as that dish , we 're in business . You say , " Stack ' em , " I 'll say , " How high ? " Commence at your discretion , pal . I 'll be in the head . Sure . [ Alonzo ] Baines , prep cargo pods for the drop . Mmm . What the - [ Grunts ] [ Loud Grunting ] [ People Screaming ] [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Grunting ] - What 's going on ? [ Female Computer Voice ] Warning . Cargo pods won 't release ! They 're dragging us down ! Baines , unlock it ! Cut them loose . ! [ Baines ] Release mech is jammed . ! We 've picked up a heavy magnetic charge . ! [ Alonzo ] Then blow them off ! .Do it . ! - " [ Computer Voice ] Pods one , two , three . " - " [ Baines ] Charges are dead . ! " - [ Grunting ] - Ow ! Come on , Bess ! Whoa ! We 're not going down on this thing , Bess ! [ Sobbing ] We 're not dying here , Bess . Aah ! Morgan ! Morgan ! [ Computer Voice ] Warning . Evacuation warnings are in effect . [ Cries Out ] Everything will be fine . Do not panic ! Do not panic ! There 's enough room for everyone ! [ Computer ] One , two , three . Warning . [ Screams ] Evacuation warnings are in effect . True ! Where are you , girl ? True ! Bess , in ! Get in ! [ Computer Voice ] Evacuation air lock engage . Hurry ! - Hey ! Hey ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? - Morgan ! Bess !

Don 't give me can 't ! I want an atmospheric reading . - Nothing . - [ Sighs ] [ Baines ] Sensors are down . Open the hatch . There 's nowhere else to go . We can 't stay here . That 's right . All right , everybody . Stay calm . Stay put . I 'm gonna open this damn hatch . All right . Hatch opening ! [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] Here we go . I 'm at 130 over 90 . It 's too high . I know . It 's okay . Just take a big breath . What is it ? How 's he doing ? No signal from the other crafts . Keep trying . So ? No sign of trauma . You 're clear . Thank God ! [ Chattering ] [ Man ] We 're gonna need water . Yale . Take this . Keep your eye out for anything that moves . I can 't . Weapons aversion in the Yale program ? [ Tones Resonating ] I tried to hold her . I couldn 't shake the unit . Can you hold still for a second , please ? Please ! I told you . I just wrenched it . Please just give me a minute , okay ? You 're gonna have to take 24 hours . You 've got multiple fractures here . I mean , you 're not gonna be walking until at least tomorrow . You did take a bone-healer vaccine ? It was for the colonists . I wasn 't even landing . [ Sighs ] Hey . Is - Is this dirt , Dad ? Yeah , I guess so . Cool . That 's cool . I - I don 't think this is such a good idea , Bess . - I feel like we 're gonna get arrested . - What for ? Burning wood 's been illegal on Earth since I was a kid , Morgan . Even though we burned everything else . Bess ! It 's spreading . See - Morgan , don 't worry . It 's gonna stay put . And if anyone else is alive , they 'll see our " fl " ames . [ Insect Chirping ] Yeah . You know , Bess , I think ... that we may be the only ones who made it . I - I feel awful about leaving them like that . Morgan , stop blaming yourself . You explained it . There was nothing you could do . We just broke away . The wind shear just ripped the pod right off . We 're lucky we got out alive . Thank goodness you got the door closed . Yeah . You know , you 're - you 're actually a hero . [ Grunts , Chuckles ] That is definitely one of our pod sectionals . The other 15 could be scattered all over this planet . Mmm . Pod 12 . Inventory has it with vehicles , V.T.O. aircraft and probably some clothing . What would you estimate ? Another 10 hours of darkness ? I don 't know . We 'll move at first light . Devon . It 's just so hard to believe . If this is anything like Earth was hundreds of years ago - It 's a second chance . The odds are unbelievable . Save some of that for later , pal . I am . Hmm . That 's all there is , son . Better eat it . No , thanks . Come here . Come here . I want to show you kids something . - You know what this is ? - Mm-mmm . - No . - It 's a relic from another time . What is it ? It 's money , currency . People used to trade these things for goods down on Earth ... before everyone got fund transfer codes . See ? One side is a buffalo . [ Clicks Tongue ] Other side 's an Indian head . See that ? [ Sighs ] You wanna hold this a while for me ? Uly , that 's gonna bring you some good luck on this new planet . See you . Bye-bye . You don 't like semolina , huh ? I heard a kid who choked to death on it once . Really ? So , if you 're not gonna eat it - I get it . You want something , so you decide to be nice to the freak . You 're crazy ! Want it ? Help yourself . [ Purring Sound ] [ Cooing Sound ] [ Screams ] [ Purring ] Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . I know you 're not a kitty , but what are you ? [ Giggling ] [ Chuckling ] Here you go . Want it ? Here you go . [ Giggling ] All right . All right . Watch out . Watch your step . I need to sit down for just a second . Hey . Can I help you ? Here , boy . Up you go . There . Hey . Hey . Careful . Just watch his tubing . All right . [ Purring ] There she is , people ! Oh , my God . We 've been robbed . We 're not alone . Something really picked this place clean . V.T.O. aircraft , titanium building units and probably a land vehicle . What about that other bay ? It doesn 't look like they got there . We 're not sure . No individual bay manifests . Oh , great . You manage to get that open yet ? Yeah , a couple more inches maybe . Not " one " piece of probe info showed even an inkling of civilization . No roads , no structures , no agriculture . Whatever it is , it must be interested in manufactured goods . We 've checked the last 25 years ' worth of probe reports . There 's nothing about " fl " ora and fauna . Yeah , government probes for newscast . We saw what they wanted us to see . [ Danziger ] One , two , three . ! [ Grunts ] All right . Come on . Come on . Got ' im . All right . Yeah . Looks like we got ourselves a Zero unit . Part of one anyway . [ Male Electronic Voice ] Actually , I 've got an entire body in here . Construction worker series , ready to give New Pacifica a full 100 % . Can 't speak for New Pacifica , but we could sure use the rest of your unit . Easy there , pal . Oh , boy . There 's gotta be a smarter way to do this . Hold on ! [ Danziger ] All right . Be careful . I will ! Are you in ? Yeah . Do you see the unit ? Yeah . I see it . Okay , see if you can reach the collar control panel . All right . Be careful . I will . Whoa ! It 's humming !

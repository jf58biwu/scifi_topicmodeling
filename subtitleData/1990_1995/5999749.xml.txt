 We are ready when you are , General . Hold on , boys . He said he 'd be here at- - Four thirty , General . I always try to be on time . Glad you could make it , Superboy . My pleasure , sir . It 's good to see you again . So why the sudden call ? Recognize that rock over there ? That 's kryptonite . The glass is leaded , you 're safe . So what 's this all about ? As you know , Professor Peterson was called away on a research trip to Addis Ababa . He asked us to complete this test . We 're trying to harness the power of kryptonite . We know how dangerous kryptonite is to you . We 've been working to negate the rays that are harmful to you while retaining its radioactive power . Is something like that possible ? We 'll find out soon enough . Gentlemen , we 're ready to begin . Very good , General . Well ? Is it safe ? Can we come in now ? Ah , yes , General . The both of you can come in . Am I to assume this experiment wasn 't a complete success ? Well , fortunately we 've nullified the radiation deadly to Superboy . Really , Superboy , it is all right . You see ? It is all right . You 're right ! I don 't feel a thing . This is great ! But ? As far as retaining any of the green kryptonite 's power , well , the experiment was a total washout . I 'm sorry , General . If it wasn 't for me , you 'd have your power source . Nonsense . Your life 's far too important to risk . Besides , we 've won half the battle . We 're going to continue working on this , Superboy . Well , thank you for your efforts . Think nothing of it , Super ... Aaahhh ! Whoa ! Guess I don 't know my own strength ! Superboy , what 's wrong ? Nothing 's wrong . What are you doing ? What I should have been doing all along . Letting the world know who 's in charge . Listen to this . For the past 24 hours , Superboy has held the city hostage with random acts of violence . After defeating a battalion of police officers , he flew off vowing to take the money he was owed for all he did for America . Huh , incredible , huh ? Whoa , Clark , lighten up ! Huh ! Somebody had a rough day at the library , huh ? Clark , is something wrong ? What 's your problem ? What 's your problem ? I mean , how would you like to live with that everyday ? Get him out of here , Lana ! I 'm not in the mood . Come on , Andy . Fine . Let 's just leave him alone . He must be pretty upset about what happened to Superboy . Agh ! What the hell was that ? One of the inmates . This is a home for the criminally insane after all . Maybe this was a crazy idea . It 's not crazy . It 's dangerous . To give that man this tremendous power again , it 's too damn risky . We have no other course of action . Exposure to the red kryptonite turned Superboy bad . We did it to him , we have to try to undo it . And this is the best plan you 've come up with ? I am as nervous about this as you are . Bottom line , there 's only one guy that can stop Superboy . Maybe . But after he stops Superboy , who 's gonna stop him ? Warden , ordway , what a pleasant surprise . Who 's your friend with the fancy outfit ? This is General Swan Metallo . Metallo . Nice to see you . You 'll forgive me for not rising to the occasion . I got a bad ticker . Plus , I got all this excess baggage . The general 's come here with a proposition for you . Oh , do you ? Ha ha . Lucky me . It 's about Superboy . You see , Superboy 's had this- - Oh yeah , yeah , yeah . I seen it . I seen it all on the news . You guys really got your hands full , don 't you ? You know ? I eh , eh I coulda beat the , eh , the pants off that , that little squirpty the last time we fought . Except , he got lucky . That 's why I 'm here . We need your help to stop Superboy . Oh , you gotta be kidding ? I mean look at me , will ya ? I 'm half , I 'm half robot for God 's sakes . I , I weigh a ton . I can 't even get up to change the channel on the damn TV . If my people could fix that , make you more powerful than you 've ever been , would you help us stop him then ? Stop him ? Ha ha , I 'd kill him ! No , we want him alive . Oh , that 's no fun . We want to try to help him . Change him back the way he was . Well , say I did stop him ? Huh ? What would happen to me then ? Then you would disconnect me and I would land right back here ? Nah ! We 're prepared to offer you a full pardon . No strings attached . Nah , I don 't think so . We need to get started right away . That 's why I brought this . That 's what I 've been waiting for . Ha ha . Plug me in and sign me up , sarge . I 'm a lucky guy . Ha ha , we 're in the army now . Metallo ! That 's my name . Don 't wear it out . You 're making a big mistake , Metallo . I 'm not the kid I was before . Neither am I , pal . Neither am I. I 'm not supposed to kill ya , but you 're pushing your luck . Easy , Metallo . Don 't do anything you 'll regret . The only thing I regret , is not killing him the last time . Oh , what are you doing ? You trying to steal my thunder , huh ? The kryptonite , it 's killing me ! I 've got to get it away from me . Hey , forget it . Thanks to Uncle Sam , I 'm new and improved . This kryptonite 's not going anywhere unless I say so . Agh ! They told me not to kill you , but I was never any good at following orders , ha ha . Goodbye , Superboy . I took care of you for good . Oh , yeah . You see , I 'm Metallo that made you , the Boy of Steel , into a pile of rubble . That 's it . You 're finished . Case closed . That takes care of that pain in the butt . Ow ! Wow ! I told you we wanted him alive ! Yeah ? Well it 's too late , General . I got what I wanted out of this deal . He 's dead . I killed him . I killed Superboy ! You 'll rot in prison for this . Yeah ? Well , it was worth it . Just to have the chance to get even . Oh , no ! You gotta be kidding ? What does it take to kill that guy for good ? Thank God ! He 's alive ! We still have a chance . Chance ? A chance ? This is getting boring . I gotta kill him again . No way ! You 're finished here . Oh , give me that . He 's getting away . You 're letting him get away from me . This ain 't over yet , Superboy ! Least it ain 't a total loss . Oh , where you been , Clark ? Leave me alone . Are you OK ? I said leave me alone ! You know , you 're upset about Superboy , okay , we all are . You know , but , you just , you gotta get a grip on yourself . Shut up ! We 're going live to the Crescent Bank where Michelle Sheppard is standing live with a special report . Michelle ? Give me that . Give me it . Hey , hey , Superboy . I sure hope you 're out there watching 'cause I wanna thank you for making this , this bank such easy pickins . It 's kinda ironic , isn 't it ? It 's like we 're a team , ha ha . That 's my money . I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart . I got my money , I got my babes , and I 'm a lucky guy . What a geek . I wonder how he got mixed up in all this ? Money . Babes . Clark ? He 's not taking it very well . Mom , can I call you back later on ? Okay , great . Talk to you later , bye . Superboy ? That 's my name , don 't wear it out . Aw , what a cute little fish . Cute little guy , huh ? What are you doing ? You 're crazy ! This can 't be happening ? Well , it is happening and you 're a part of it . Look , I know something must be terribly wrong for you to be acting this way . Talk to me . Explain it to me . I don 't have to explain anything to you . Now get dressed . I said get dressed ! Wear this ! Barkeep ? Another round for all my friends . I 'm a big man now , ya know ? Huh ? Right girls ? Ha ha . This is crazy ! Bartender , give me a bottle . Now ! That 's for you , Metallo . Thanks a lot , pal . How do you like my squeeze ? I like the chick . She ain 't so bad . Lots of other broads around , but she 'll do for now . Look at yourself . Do you know what you 're doing ? She got a big yap , don 't she ? You 're right . Why don 't you split ? Get lost ! There are lots more broads around this place . I hope you come back to us , Superboy . Ha ha . I like your style , kid . You know , I 've been thinking . Yeah what ? - That you and I- - - yeah ? Little luck , we could be running this country in one month . Yeah ? Yeah , and I got the perfect plan . Huh ? Spill it . We take that military base tomorrow . That 's the one where they perform those operations to improve you , right ? Yeah , right , right . You , you think they could make me even stronger ? We 'll force them to . Hell , it 's a golden opportunity . Only I see one problem . What 's that ? I mean , I can 't get close to you . That 's why I brought this . It 's lined with enough lead to protect me from kryptonite . Oh hey , huh , forget it , pal . You don 't need that . All I gotta do is just turn down the juice . You 'll be fine . Incidentally , where did you pick this up ? Huh ? I took it off a cop . Oh oh , say no more . Partner , ha ha . Oh no , no , allow me . No , allow me . Let 's do it together . After you , pal . Thank you , pal . Hey , don 't mention it . Anything for a friend . Oh , that 's a big one . There 's your rock . Ah , is this what it appears to be ? It is ! It 's another chunk of the magic rock ! Now I 'll be twice as strong , ha ha ! Or twice as dead . What do you mean ? I 'm turning your kryptonite red . Oh , I was gonna double-cross you ! But you double-crossed me ! It 's a , it 's a double , double-cross . You think I could ever team up with a loser like you ? Ha ha once you 're out of the way , nothing can stand in my way . Nothing ! Superboy , don 't ! We can help you . No , we can 't . Do it . Kill him . What are you , a coward ? Don 't back down now , Superboy . Just one punch . And he 's finished . Kill him ! I , I can 't . Oh , good . I can 't . I can 't kill . Where am I ? I don 't remember anything . Why did you do that ? I don 't know . I , I just knew that you couldn 't hurt anybody , so I let you make your own decisions by using reverse psychology . Well thanks for stalling me long enough for that second dose of red kryptonite to cure me . We 're terribly sorry , Superboy . It was all our fault . I will accept full responsibility and clear your name . And what about Metallo ? I 'll have my men put him back where he belongs . Are you going to be alright ? I really don 't remember too much about what happened but , do you think you can ever forgive me ? I don 't know . Yeah , I can . Captioned by Grant Brown

 Last time on Stephen King 's Golden Years ... Harlan Williams , tech number 10884 . Custodian third . Scientific history , gentlemen . - You were here . - Overload ! Overload across the board . Yes ... The janitor is still alive . I 'll be checking him out . Very actively . I want you to look at his eyes . I 've been experimenting with regeneration , attempting to accelerate the healing process in living tissue . Regeneration is just a cover . For what ? I don 't know . Shouldn 't we find out ? You told me to call if I noticed anything odd about the janitor 's reexam . You 're getting younger . - Gina , that 's ... - That 's crazy ? Yeah . But it 's happening . Tell me , Doc . Does he understand what 's happening ? I mean , really ? I want you to pack a few suitcases and keep them in the front hall closet . Just in case . - You 'll have to make an appointment . - I don 't think this can wait . This ... This ... This better be good . It 's 3 a.m. - And ... - Some maniac killed Dr Eakins . You 've got to see it . - Okay . Just a second . - I 'm in his office . - 117 ... - Tell me the address again . And slow down . 117 , South Main ... No , don 't worry . You didn 't even call . Yeah . You 'll get your usual payment on the 15th . - Hello . - Lewis . You 'd better wake up quick . We 've got a problem . Are you serious ? I wouldn 't be standing here now if I wasn 't . How do you feel about your phone ? I haven 't given it much thought . Remember how to play baseball ? No ... Yes . - Yes , I do . - Okay . Get to a safe phone and call me in about an hour . Are you ready for the numbers ? Hold on . Hold on . Shoot . Over 9 innings , 5 runs on 12 hits , 6 errors , 4 men left on base . And the visiting team ... 8 runs on 13 hits , 12 errors , 5 men left on base , winning pitcher number 12 . - Got it ? - Got it . You know something ? I hate this cloak and dagger routine . Well , the area code 's right . It 's okay . Ma 'am , police investigation . Get back behind the barrier . It 's now become a government investigation , too . Terry Spann , Scientific Affairs . You got some ID ? What 's the matter ? The problem is I don 't like you guys . I don 't like the way you come here flashing your badge . Sometimes I don 't like us guys much either . Officer . The eyes of Texas are upon you ... Stevie , how are you doing in there ? - Sheriff . - Miss Spann . - I 'm going in ? - Yeah , go on in . - Holy ... - Mackerel , holy cow . Holy moly . And who might this be ? Miss Spann , Steve Dent . The photographer for " The Falco Plains Free Democrat " . Hell with that . I 'm the entire photography department there . Where 's Harvey Miller ? He went back to Ryandeck . So for the last few months , Steve 's been my crime scene photographer . Got some pictures you wouldn 't believe , too . Steve ... I was out on the 89 two weeks ago . One of the teenagers was decapitated . You got what you need here ? His head was torn off . Steve ... Can 't use that kind of stuff in the papers . Sorry , Miss Spann . What 's your connection to the crime ? State ? Steve , you got what you need . I want you to go now . All right ... I can 't stand being yelled at after midnight . It gives me the migraine . Nice meeting you , Miss Spann . So ... You want to fill me in ? The night watchman found the body at 1.45 a.m. No sign of forcible entry . - The victim was shot ? - One time . In the face . This is the first case of premeditated murder in this town in three years . It 's a pretty big mess , right ? Yeah ... - Terry . - Yes ? What are you doing here ? I 'm not really sure . That is such bullshit . Who called you ? - Who says someone did ? - They had to . Or you 've been monitoring police broadcasts at 3 a.m. , and that 's not your style . Besides , your eyes are puffy . Someone had to jerk you out of bed to get you here . Did your man or the photographer touch anything ? No , and you 'd better not either . Or I 'll be up at police headquarters in Albany having my hide pulled off a strip at a time . Anything removed ? Nah , just the body . I had Doc Palaski do a scene post-mortem . I would 've chalked an outline , but I found him sitting in the chair . - Pretty weird , huh ? - Where is he now ? In a meat locker down at Warren 's market . I called the Hayman funeral home , - but both Donnie and his kid are ... - Out on a toot . Yep , out on a toot . What do you think ? You still haven 't said what your interest in this is . - I can 't . - Why not ? National security ? I don 't know yet . Local eye doctor gets greased , office is trashed and then you show up . Things could get cuter , but I don 't know how . Sheriff ... I 'd like to be alone . - You kidding ? - I won 't mess up the crime scene . I won 't . I might just touch a few papers by their corners . Scout 's honour . National security . No . This is between you and me . Call it a professional courtesy . Doc Eakins was a good man . He had a wife and two kids . You find out who did this . And give me a chance to bust him . If I can . Ah ... I can 't smoke this in here . I 'll take it outside . Watch out after this place while I 'm gone , will you ? I will . And be gone when I get back . I will . Sheriff ... I owe you one . It 's gone . Andrews . That son of a bitch Andrews . Okay , just a second . Tell me the address again . Slowly . 117 South Main , 2nd floor . I 'm in his office now . You have to see this . Some maniac killed Dr Eakins . The eyes of Texas are upon you ... Hey , Myrtle . I know how you feel . I love you , too , honey . - Let me hear you say it again . - Excuse me . Oh baby , I wish I was there with you . Hey , Mac . I 've been saving it for you , baby . I 've got an emergency phone call to make . - Please ! - Get lost . I 'm going to give it to you as soon as I get back home . Hang up the phone or you won 't have anything left to give . I 've got to go . Someone wants to use the phone . Larry ... Larry , are you ... Oh , please be home , Stevie . Please be home . Hi-ho , it 's Steve-o-reno . Not in right now , but hey ... About time you got off the line . What the hell is going on ? We 're going to have a meltdown here in twelve hours . - Maybe four . - So what are you going to do ? Lewis , I want to take the janitor and his wife out . Take them out ? You mean ... No ! I mean take them out of Falco Plains . I want to get them right now and take them ... Anywhere . Because if I don 't , Andrews will . Slow down , Terry . Okay . Andrews killed the local eye doctor . His name is Eakins . The one that , you know ... did the retest on Williams . The one Williams passed . - That was a set-up . I told you . - I know what you told me . Then Major Moreland from Personnel visited me . That twit . That twit told me Williams did more than pass the test . He blew it away , so , tonight Jude Andrews blew away the eye doctor . - Do you know for certain it ... - No . But I do know Williams ' file is gone and I 'll tell you what . I would not get near that base stock Ackerman with a 10-foot pole . He 's the only other one that knows . - Knows what ? - About Williams . And about Redding . Don 't you get it ? Get what ? Redding was getting younger . He was doing it fast , because he got a direct blast of whatever happened at the lab explosion . Williams was exposed to the same forces , but not as much . That 's why he 's going slower . Why he 's still alive . Jude Andrews has figured this out . He 's playing with us . Look ... I 'm stuck in DC until tomorrow . What a guy . Wearing pyjamas . - Can 't this wait till I get back ? - No . I 've got to move now . I 'm afraid that if I don 't , Andrews will grab Williams for the Shop . Ackerman and Williams ' wife will become unfortunate accidents . Then so will we . How did you get to the eye doctor so fast ? I had a new guy come in a few months ago . He 's been snooping around town . - He called me . - Can Andrews connect him to you ? To us ? Yeah , I think he already has . I 've got to ... Look , I 've got to get out of here . - Terry ... - Let 's play baseball again soon . Write fast , Lewis . That man needs to leave . I 've got it . - Terry ... - Five hours ... The eyes of ... Eakins , Eakins are upon you ... Yo . The eyes of Eakins are upon you ... The eyes of Texas are upon you . Will you be using the bathroom ? No . You have no proof it was Andrews . Cut the bull . It 's too late or too early or too something . It 's Andrews and we both know it . I want to go get the janitor and his wife . Why did you call , Terry ? You 'll try it whether I say you can or not . About him , I don 't know much . But she 's one hell of a nice woman , Lewis . I don 't want her on a slab with a tag tied to her toe . And you hate Andrews . Yeah ... I hate Andrews . He 's everything that 's wrong with everything . He 's not National Security , he 's Murder Incorporated . I saw him butcher a whole family . Is that why you stopped working together ? It doesn 't matter . I want to get them out . Before it gets light . Where will you take them ? The local BB ? I don 't know yet . When it comes down to that , they may have a better idea . But ... if Andrews gets to them first , that woman is going to end up getting her throat cut . Williams will just disappear . And you know that . So you want permission to kidnap a woman and man who may prove there really is a fountain of youth ? Since you put it like that ... Yes . Terry , I can 't do that . I 've got 23 years and I 'm a general . Not a heavy duty one , not Patton , but a US government official with orders and a damnable responsibility ! You 're inviting me to be the guest of honour at my own court marshal . On the basis of one phone call . Well , two actually . All right . Two . Look , Lewis , all I want is for you to promise me a few things . One ... You 'll remember what I told you tonight . - What else ? - Two ... You won 't let the Shop make Harlan Williams into an unperson . And you won 't let them turn me into an unperson in your mind . That 's three things , Terry . But at a time like this , who 's counting ? And Lewis , if I ... pick up the phone some time and ask you to play a game of baseball , you won 't hang up on me , will you ? Never . You 're really going up against Andrews , right ? If I have to . He was writing on the wall ... Do you want to promise , or forget it ? - Lewis , I 'm out of time . - Go for it , Terry . Yes ! Excuse me , Sir . What room are you registered in at the hotel ? Who is ... What time is it ? It 's 5.15 . I 'll go . You stay here . Harlan ... Harlan , be careful . Come on . Come on ! - Who the hell are you ? - Easy . I 'm putting it away . Harlan , I think I know her . You never did learn to mind . Mr Williams , there may not be much time . Yeah ? Why should I trust you ? You know who Jude Andrews is ? You 've seen him at the plant . Your house is bugged . How do you know ? I had it done the night you were injured . Mrs Williams , look in that lamp there . Gina ! Take out the bulb . And give it to me . Okay . There 's a receiver unit in your basement . Come on in . Thank you . Harlan , we can 't just go . - All our things ... - Gina ... We have no other choice . What about the house ? He 's right , Mrs Williams . All they want is the thing you really care about . Your husband . Well ... They 're not going to get him without a fight . Let me tell you something . The first thing Jude Andrews is going to do if he gets here before we 're gone , is to try and kill me . I 'm good . He 's better . If he drops me , he 'll then put a hole in your wife 's head . Why ? Where do we go ? I don 't know . We 'll decide once we 're on our way . Let me suggest one other thing . Bring your gun . - Do you have a lipstick ? - A lipstick ? Yes . - Why ? - Give it to me , please . Can I use the keys just for a minute ? Do you still think we can trust her ? Yes . Let 's get in the car . - Why did you want the lipstick ? - I 'll tell you later . I 'd like you both to get in the back seat . - Do you know something , Miss Spann ? - No . But my internal radar is going crazy . Yeah , Terry . Just like old times . Jude ... - Give me five more minutes . - He won 't last that long . You 've got everything that kid knows . It ends now . Can 't do it . Sorry . You 'd better be wrong . Where did you get these ? It doesn 't matter . What matters is that these are only copies . So you call off your friend Rafael or you 'll read about yourself in the paper . All the news that 's fit to print . What 's the matter with you , Terry ? Been taking stupid pills ? When did that start ? Around the time you started to enjoy your work . You won 't go though with it . You haven 't got the guts . I 've got the guts . And guess what . For a limited time only ... Oh , look . The photographs have a soundtrack . Isn 't that special ? What if I just kill you ? Short circuit that quacking mouth of yours for once and all . You 'll be a worldwide attraction . Bigger than Michael Jackson . What happened to you ? No ... The question is ... What in the hell 's happening to you ? Go ahead , big man . Go ahead . Rafael , stop . Wait . Wait a moment . There 's been a change . Picture and tapes won 't do you any good now , dear . The ones that aren 't dead are gone . And the ones who aren 't gone don 't care . Not even the press cares . All the cannibal dictators have gone to cannibal hell . Soon to be joined by one blonde rogue agent . Just like old times . Okay . I think we 're safe on this road for maybe two hours . It 'll take them that long to get their act together . To coordinate the search . - But you work for the government . - Yes , I do . - So does Andrews . - Who is this Andrews ? The man I saw yesterday . And the man who killed your eye doctor . - No ... - Dr Eakins ? Please , we don 't have any time . There may be five different government agencies involved in the Gold Series . The stakes are very high . What 's happening to you has never happened to any man in history . The government wants you . Jude Andrews wants to deliver you . The difference is , when he catches up to us , he wants to take you alive . Your wife and I are excellent candidates for a landfill . Oh my God . They 'd consider it information control . So ... You tell me . East or west ? Otherwise I 'll just flip a coin . - West . - Why west ? You know . I don 't like this , Mother . We 're going west . I want someone in her office in half an hour . Tear the place apart . Yeah . Call me if you find anything . - Hello , Fredericks . Where have you been ? - Sleeping . Here 's the file you wanted . Everybody , take five . - You get briefed on the situation ? - Yeah . - There 's just one thing I don 't get . - What 's that ? Why is Terry doing this ? Because she 's an idiot . Lovely way to talk about your ex-partner . Soon to be dead ex-partner . That has a nice ring to it , don 't you think ? I was worried she might have blown some career advancement opportunities . Do you have clearance to take her out ? From the top . Don 't worry about it . Then what am I doing here ? You 're here to help search for the murder suspect . - Murder suspect ? - Sure . Harlan Williams . He 's your murder suspect . Killed his eye doctor . Old guy wanted to keep working so bad after flunking his eye test , he put a few holes in the doctor . And then falsified the test results . Senile dementia . Fear of ageing . He 's even dying his hair brown . - What about Terry and Mrs Williams ? - Hostages . Terry went to arrest him . The old guy got the drop on her . It might work . With all this chaos . Come in . You got some pictures for me , Mr Andrews ? My associate Mr Fredericks . He 'll be in charge till I get back . - Pleased to work with you . - Yeah . Call me as soon as they 're located . You understand ? As soon as . Where will you be ? At Dr Frankenstein 's . Who ? Dr Richard X. Todhunter . The guy that started this party . I can 't help you with that ? Harlan thinks we should be heading the other way . He doesn 't want to involve Francie . - Who 's that ? - Our daughter . - Leave Francie out of this . - We can 't . She 'd never forgive us if we did . She 's been involved in every unpopular cause in this country . Since , what ... 1968 ? Remember the Democratic Convention in Chicago ? All those kids protesting in front of the convention hall ? She stayed . She 's still in Chicago . That 's where we 're going ? She doesn 't like government by the club , our Francie . She and Whitney wouldn 't want to help us . Who 's Whitney ? She has this beautiful seeing eye dog named Whitney . Big German shepherd . - Whitney loves her . - And people that don 't love her ... Whitney can rid them of their operating equipment . Well ... It 's further than I wanted to go , but ... maybe it 's worth the chance . Why are you doing this ? 'Cause I 'm an idiot . Let 's get out of here . We have photos of each of the hostages . We know that he 's armed . But I want everyone to keep their weapons holstered . He 's a confused old man who probably doesn 't even remember what he 's done . We don 't want anyone to get hurt . Any questions ? Why did you turn off ? You said we 'd be safe on 20 for at least two hours . I know . I thought we would be , but ... the road was getting warm . How do you know that ? It 's just something you feel . Okay ? Yeah ... I think I felt something myself . You 're okay , Pop . You may just have a chance after all . Wh ... What did you say ? I think you heard me , Doctor . I said the janitor 's growing younger . If ... Are you all right ? Yes , I 'm ... I feel a bit faint , that 's all . May I have some water , please ? Thank you . I 've got a prescription . Since the explosion , I 've been having some difficulty . What you take is between you and your physician . Did you understand what I just said ? Yes . That the janitor is growing younger . My first impulse was to say that 's impossible . That would be anyone 's first impulse . Wouldn 't you agree ? Yes . But then I thought , " No , it 's not impossible " . " Of course . " It 's exactly what we were trying to do with the guinea pigs . Isn 't it ? - I believe they were mice . - Mice , yes . But a guinea pig is a guinea pig . Speaking in the generic sense . What ... If this Williams received only a light dusting , and we were barely into production 1 , that means that the ... effects are much more powerful than we thought . Much more . Would you like to see the janitor ? - Interview him ? Examine him ? - Yes . At once . Of course . Are you joking ? There must be tests . There must be extensive testing . We 'll start tomorrow . No . Tonight . Tonight . I want him admitted to the infirmary . I want to do the prelim myself . - There 's a slight problem . - What problem ? The janitor has split . Taken a powder . On the lamb . He 's run away ? Now we 've reached an understanding . He can 't do that . He 's government property . I 'm aware of that . But Mr Williams is not . Certain people in Washington need to be convinced . Can you call those people ? Convince them that getting Mr Williams back is not only important , but should be considered America 's top priority right now ? I most certainly will . With whom do you believe I should start , Mr Andrews ? I think the Secretary of Defence would be a good bet , don 't you ? A capital start , Mr Andrews . Operator ? This is Dr Todhunter . Dr Richard X. Todhunter . And this is a maximum security call . That 's right . The number ... is 2-0-2 ... There . That 's the one . You don 't mean what I think you mean . I think she does . She ... does . Your idea of inconspicuous is very strange . Do you want to know what 's inconspicuous ? Something that 's too big and improbable to be what you 're looking for . I 'd drive us to Chicago in the Chrysler building if I could . But it doesn 't have wheels and the bridge clearances are too low . Well , that makes sense . In a crazy sort of way . Mr Williams , while I see if I can get this thing started , I want you to drive my car up to the entrance over there . Park it and leave the keys in the ignition . Leave them ? I can 't guarantee someone will come up there and steal it , but I can hope , can 't I ? Well ... I guess there 's no law against that . I 'll pick you up in a minute . Miss Spann ... Now we 're going into the hearse-stealing business , why don 't you drop the Mr Williams and just call me Harl ? I 'm Terry . It 's not much , but my mum likes it . Harlan , where are your glasses ? I see better without them now . Come on , baby . Come on , baby . Yes . I can 't believe any of this is happening . I keep thinking I 'll wake up . It 's happening , all right . I 'm too old for this . That makes two of us , darling . Does it ? It 's going to be a little cramped , but the back seems to be occupied . Oh ... my ... I 'm hoping it 's a demo . It 's hard to imagine some guy stopping for a movie or a few video games with a stiff in the back of his vehicle . Good taste doesn 't seem to be one of your strong points . You sound just like my mother . Hey ! Hey , you guys . - Yeah . - Hi . Hold on . Go get us some coffee or something . Yeah . Pennsylvania State Police found Terry 's car . It 's about time . It 's after 2 in the afternoon . Is the janitor all right ? - If anybody shot him , I 'll ... - Wait . - There were three kids in there . - What ? All I know is that a cop spotted the licence on State Highway 29 and chased it . It looks ... I know what it looks like . - She booted us . - I don 't understand . An old road gang trick . First thing you do when you cut and run is swap cars . When they search ... - I see . - No , I don 't think you do . I 'm beginning to wonder if anyone does . You talk to that half-wit sheriff . Get a list of anything reported missing or stolen in the last 6 hours . - From Falco Plains . - Anywhere within a 200-mile radius . I want a list of cars , trucks , anything with wheels . That may take a little while . You have that list ready for me when I 'm back . - When will that be ? - I 'm leaving now . - But how am I going to ... - Just do it . I am not a secretary ! - Goodnight , Sheriff . - Officer . Hey . Look at me when I 'm talking to you . I 'm in charge . Look at me . I don 't want officer Feronda anywhere near me . He 's a moron . Hi . I 'm out of here . Good night . I hope you 're not going to disappoint me . I 've had this thing ready for hours . What good will it do ? Seven cars have been reported missing . This is everything ? Cars , trucks , motorcycles ? Yep . Including the hearse . What hearse ? The cops say they have a very distressed undertaker from the town of Crowswood on their hands . Seems he parked his hearse at the mall at Rocksbury to watch a movie , then came back out and the hearse was gone . And these kids boosted Terry 's car from the very same mall ? - You don 't think ... - I know . It 's what I 'd do . Smart woman . Yeah , she ought to be . I trained her . - You got the hearse 's license number ? - No , but I 'll get it . I want to talk to General Crewes .

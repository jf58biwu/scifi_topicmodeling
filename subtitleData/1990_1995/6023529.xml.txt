 Arctic Ice Core Project Icy Cape , Alaska 250 miles north of the Arctic Pole We 're not ... who ... we are . We 're not ... who ... we are . It goes no further than this . It stops right here , ... right now . X-Files Season 1 Episode 8 ( 1x07 ) - Ice Team Captain John Richter here . It 's been a couple of frustrating months . But after a lot of stick-with-it-ness , we 're proud to report that half an hour ago , we broke the previous record for drilling down into an ice sheet . This team of scientists made up the Arctic Ice Core Project . They were sent to Alaska by the Advanced Research Project Agency a year ago to drill into the arctic ice . The samples they removed contained trapped gases , dust , chemicals . Evidence that could reveal the structure of the Earth 's climate back to the dawn of man . Their work was a success , nearly completed . No reports or indications of problems of any kind . Until , only a week later , this next transmission . We 're not ... who ... we are . We 're not ... who ... we are . It goes no further than this . It stops ... right here , ... right now . What happened up there ? So far nobody 's been able to reach the compound because of bad weather . Obviously we must be brilliant or expendable because we 've pulled the assignment . It is severe isolation distress ? These were top geophysicists , trained and screened for this project in every way , including psychological makeup . We leave for Nome today . We 'll join three scientists familiar with the Ice Core Project , and then head north up to the Icy Cape . The National Weather Service gives us three days to get in and out before the next storm . Bring your mittens . Here 's the snap . Fouts dumps it across to Winslow ! Touchdown ! Touchdown ! Fouts ... is ... God ! Sorry . My team scored . There 's no football on Wednesdays . Fouts retired in ' 87 , didn 't he ? No , this is just my all-time favourite plays on tape . - You two fbi ? - Agent Mulder , Agent Scully . And you ? Denny Murphy . Professor of Geology , UC San Diego . San Diego ? Get much chance to study ice down there ? Just what 's around the cake . Dr Da Silva ? Dr Hodge ? Yeah . Sorry we 're late . Agents Scully and Mulder . Professor Murphy . Can I see some identification ? - What for ? - Wanna make sure we are who we say we are . That 's me . It 's you . - That 's me . - Thanks a lot . Well , now that we know who we are , anybody care to guess why we 're going ? Two federal agents , a geologist , a doctor and a toxicologist . That should give us some idea . I assume you all took a look at the tape . - Something wrong ? - Come on . You 're fbi . You have to know more than we do . You folks the ones goin ' up to Icy Cape ? - Yeah . - Then I 'm the one flying ' you . My name 's Bear . The plane 's across the way . Provisions are loaded . Grab your gear . Can we see some credentials ? Credentials ? The only credentials I have is that I 'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there . You don 't like those credentials , walk . Bear , see if you can get the power started . Anything to get out of here . Where do we start ? The body bags are on the plane . Before we touch anything , we have to thoroughly document the scene . Flashing . That 's what they were drilling for . A quarter of a million years melting away in a couple of days . I 'm gonna preserve some samples . It 's the generator . Agent Mulder ! Hold on ! Hold it down ! That ought to keep him out for a while . - Are you OK ? - Yeah . He didn 't break the skin . - Bear ? Are you OK ? - He got me . - Get thatjacket off . - Just gimme the stuff. I 'll do it myself . Is it rabies ? I don 't see any indication of glottal spasm or tetany . If it is rabies , it 's not a strain I 'm familiar with . Look at this . Black nodules . Swollen lymph nodes . Symptoms of bubonic plague . We 'll do a blood test . We 'll take it from there . This dog has got a skin irritation round its neck . Looks like it 's been scratching off its own hair . Look at this . Look at this ! What ... the hell ... was that ? From the autopsies , it 's clear these men killed one another . There are contusions around the throat areas of three men , evidence of strangulation . Richter and Campbell killed themselves . I also found tissue damage due to fever . Did any of them have the black spots the dog has ? No . None of them had the black nodules . So ... those spots didn 't have anything to do with those guys killing ' each other , right ? I wouldn 't rule it out . I just re-examined the dog . - The nodules are gone . - What could that mean ? It could mean the spots are a symptom of some disease at an early stage . Denny ? Denny . Denny . Sorry . The play-off game against Miami , ' 82 . Helps me get my mind off stuff . My interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos is a little rusty . All right . This is the Icy Cape area . It approximates the depth of the ice sheet to be about ... 3,000 metres thick . I also found this data . If I 'm reading it correctly , the team actually found the ice sheet to be twice that depth . That 's very good . The numbers indicate the topography to be concave . Looks like they were drilling inside a meteor crater . No , it 's impossible . - I analysed two samples . - What did you find ? There seems to be a presence of ammonium hydroxide in Richter 's blood . It 's not possible . Ammonia would vaporise at human body temperature . I checked all the air filtration systems . - I found no evidence of any such toxins . - I have . In the ice . And that 's not all there is . I found a high ratio of ammonia to water in the ice core . The Earth 's atmosphere couldn 't do that , not even 1 / 4 million years ago . Look in the scope . Unless a foreign object was introduced into that environment . Tell me that 's not a foreign object . Oh ! Scully . That same thing is in Richter 's blood ! What if that single-celled organism is the larval stage of a larger animal ? That 's kind of a leap , don 't you think ? The evidence is there . Maybe the organism somehow got into the men . Nothing can survive in subzero temperatures for a quarter of a million years . Unless that 's how it lives . Lookit , I don 't see why you 're squabbling over some bug . You said your autopsy found those men killed each other . That 's it . I say let 's get the hell out of here . I agree . We can have the bodies sent to a facility which can make a definitive diagnosis . In the event that something was missed , Agent Scully . If those bodies are infected , we can 't take them back . We can 't go back without proper quarantine procedures . - We can 't risk bringing back the next plague . - Say they did come down with something . We haven 't , and I ain 't waiting ' around until we do . I think it 's safe to go back . There 's no reason why we 'd be infected . - We took all the safeguards . - The dog did bite Bear . - ltjumped Mulder , too ! - There 's only one way to proceed ! A doctor eliminates every possibility . We must determine if any of us is infected . All right . Parasitic diagnostic procedure requires us each to provide a blood and a stool sample . A stool sample ? Travel always makes that kinda tough ... for me . OK ... Anybody got the morning sports section handy ? I ain 't dropping ' my cargo for no one . I 'm gettin ' my gear , gettin ' my plane , and flying ' the hell outta here ! You can 't go . The dog bit you . I got hired to fly you up here and fly you back ! No one said this might be part of the deal , so the deal is over . We can 't let him leave . - Who 's gonna stop him ? - We have to . We can 't risk infecting the population . He gets on that plane , I go with him . - We don 't have time to argue . - Take a vote . Who says we should confine Bear until he agrees to an examination ? All right . Bear , we just want to check you out . If we don 't find any trace of the parasite or the virus , we 'll all go . All right . Gimme the damn jar . Murphy ! Get a rope ! Right . Here ! Oh , my God ! - Get my bag ! - What are you gonna do ? ! - Cut it out . - We don 't know enough about it . It 's killing him ! Scully , help remove the skin . Hold still , Bear . Forceps . Hold still , Bear . One more second . You 're gonna be OK . This is the AICP investigative team calling Doolittle Airfield . Come in . DAF responding . This is Agent Mulder . We have a serious biological hazard . Request air pickup and quarantine procedures . Over . Come in , Doolittle Airfield ! We copy , Agent Mulder . We are under a heavy storm . No aircraft can get out . The military base in Kotzebue could set up a quarantine . Advise immediate evacuation . The storm is heading your way . Over . We were told we 'd have three clear days of weather ! Over ! Welcome to the top of the world . Over . Is Bear in any condition to fly ? If we don 't leave in an hour , we 're stuck for days . He 's dead . It 's similar to a tapeworm . It has a scolex with suckers and hooks . So it 's familiar . Something you can deal with . - What ? - No . Very different from any organism at least that I know of . Have you figured out how it 's transmitted ? Exchange of fluids , touch , air ? All of the above ? I don 't know . All the other bodies had the creature . Only this one is still alive . - All in the spine ? - No . It appears they were in the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain . Hypothalamus ? What was that again ? It 's a gland that secretes hormones . Although ... I don 't know why a parasite would want to attach to it . Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine , which produces violent , aggressive behaviour . See , that might be the connection . Everybody that 's been infected certainly seems to act aggressively . Maybe the worm feeds on acetylcholine and stops us controlling violent behaviour . - A parasite shouldn 't want to kill its host . - lt doesn 't kill you until it 's extracted . Then it releases a poison . So you 're saying the worm makes you wanna kill other people . Which is maybe what happened to the first team . Or what could happen to us . - lt 's just a theory . We don 't have any proof . - Except five dead men . If the worm makes people violently aggressive , why did Richter and Campbell kill themselves ? Maybe they did it to save us . I 'm just ... double-checking . Making sure I didn 't miss anything . Just some sleep , right ? Sleep ? I 'm so tired , I can 't sleep . We 're all wired and hypersensitive . It 'll be good to get a fresh start tomorrow . Mulder , I don 't want to waste a second trying to find a way to kill this thing . I don 't know if we should kill it . This area of the ice sheet is formed over a meteor crater . The worm lives in ammonia . It survived subzero temperatures . Theorists believe in ammonia-supported life on planets with freezing temperatures . No . A meteor that crashed here a quarter of a million years ago may have carried such life to Earth . Mulder , that pilot developed surface symptoms within a few minutes . Within a few hours , that parasite had total control . What would happen if this got into the population ? A city the size of New York could be infected within a few days . Exactly . But what do we know about it ? This organism might be lying dormant in another crater . If we don 't kill it now , we risk becoming Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads . But if we do kill it now , we may never know how to stop it in the future . Future ? Mulder , how can you talk ... Tell me it 's hot in here . Don 't worry , you don 't have a fever . The heating 's malfunctioning . Outside it 's 40 below , in here it 's sweltering . - Can you hear what they 're arguing about ? - Probably government secrets . You think they knew what was here before we arrived ? I 'm sure of it . You know , Bear 's infected blood did get on Scully . It also got on you . They 'd sacrifice not just evidence , but themselves ! - How do you know it can 't be contained ? - lt can ! By extermination ! We should take those bodies , worms and all , outside and incinerate them ! Something going on we should know about ? Agent Scully , are you all right ? - Yes . I 'm fine. lt 's nothing . - You seem a little bit stressed out . What the hell are you trying to say ? ! Let 's settle down. lt 's been a long day . We 're all tired and scared . - Let 's not turn on one another . - At least , not without a good reason . Maybe we should all get some sleep . Are you kidding ? You think any of us could sleep right now ? Come on , guys , let 's face it . We gotta check for spots . And any person who has them should be confined . Are we agreed on that ? Are you gonna do the exams ? No ! We do them in front of each other . No secrets . Before anyone passes judgement , may I remind you , we are in the Arctic . Sleep tight . Don 't let the bedbugs bite . Yeah . Good night . Good night , Mulder . Good night , Scully . At least everyone 's OK . Don 't forget , the spots on the dog went away . The ball 's on the three-yard line , with only 15 seconds left in the game . Fouts moves over the ball . There 's the snap ! Mulder , what are you doing ? Murphy 's dead . - You killed him . - I found him like this . I heard one of the doors close . I came out to check it out . - lt 's one of you . - He 's lying . - You could 've done it and not known . - No , he said he didn 't . I have no symptoms . - You checked him . - Yeah , six hours ago ! - lt was one of you ! - Stop it ! Shut up ! Mulder , just put the gun down and let Hodge give you a blood test . And doctor the results ? He may be infected ! He has to be confined - now ! Then turn around and let us take a look at your neck ! I 'm not turning my back on anyone ! As far as I 'm concerned , you 're all infected ! Hodge is right ! Lock him up ! - Mulder ! - Scully , get that gun off me ! - Mulder , you have to understand ! - Put it down ! - You put it down first ! - Scully ! For God 's sakes , it 's me ! Mulder , you may not be who you are ! In here , I 'll be safer than you . What were you doing ? You know what I was doing . You know , you 're the only one with a gun . If you get infected , we don 't stand a chance . OK . Was there something there ? You 're OK , Nancy . We 're all OK . Now is not the time for the three of us to turn on each other . There 's four of us . - Mulder isn 't one of us any more . - If Mulder is infected , it 's not his fault ! We can 't turn our backs on him now ! He needs us to help him ! She 's right . Prolonged exposure to the parasite could damage him to the point of permanent psychosis . But if he is infected , he doesn 't go back . I won 't risk the possibilities . This is AICP calling Doolittle Airfield . Please come in . This is the Arctic Ice Core Project sending a general distress call . Please respond . Nancy , put a drop of uninfected blood on the slide of the blood from the pilot . Run that by me again ? Put the uninfected blood on the infected blood . No , damn it ! What did I just tell you ? ! You infected the infected blood ! Now I have to start again ! - I made a mistake . Don 't yell at me . - Wasted hours of work ! OK , then just do it by yourself , damn it ! God ! I 'm not your assistant ! Hodge ? What ? Come take a look at this . The larvae from two different worms killed each other . An individual worm will not tolerate another invading its host . It does to the invader what it did to humans . It makes them kill . A species won 't kill its own . It needs another to procreate . Worms are hermaphroditic . It can reproduce itself . Look at the evidence in the microscope . This thing does not like company . So what are you saying ? The way to kill it is to introduce another worm into an already infected body ? Sounds OK . It passed the worms in its stool . They 're dead . I want to talk to him first , try and make this voluntary . What ? You can 't go in alone . If anything happens , you come inside . I can 't do this to him until I 'm sure . Is itjust you ? Yes . It 's one of them . No one 's been killed since you 've been in here . So ? We found a way to kill it . Two worms ... in one host will kill each other . You give me one worm , you 'll infect me . If that 's true , then why didn 't you let us inspect you ? I would have , but you pulled a gun on me ! Now , I don 't trust them ! I want to trust you . OK . But now they 're not here . This is the last one . She 's not gonna let us give it to him . Well , she 'll have to if he 's infected . He 'll convince her somehow . I just examined him . He 's uninfected . So is she . Which means that it must be one of you . All right . Let 's go over to the main building . I 'd like to check him myself . Then he can examine both of us . Want to lead the way ? No ! Get the worm ! Oh , my God . Mulder ! It 's her ! Scully ! It 's Da Silva ! Hodge ! Now ! Mulder ! After this , there won 't be any left ! They 're all gonna be dead ! Do it ! It 's all right. lt 's all over . It all stops right here , right now . OK , I got it . At the intersection of Yukon and 17th . State patrol is on the scene . Code 3 . Over . She 'll be put in quarantine along with the dog . We 'll keep her there until we 're sure she won 't infect the population . Meanwhile , our tests came back normal , so we 've been released . Plane ready. lt 'll take you as far from the ice as you wanna go . I 'm goin ' back to the site . This time I 'm going fully prepared with proper equipment . There 's still research to be done on the genetic structure ... Wait , Mulder . Don 't you know ? Know what ? 45 minutes after evacuating us , they torched the place . There 's nothing left . Who did that ? The military ? Centers for Disease Control ? You ought to know . They 're your people . It 's still there , Scully . 200,000 years down , in the ice . Leave it there .

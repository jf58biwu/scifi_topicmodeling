Headache ? Chest pain ? No . I was close enough to see your license plate . All of a sudden , in the midst of it all , I saw Helen . You had a vision ? Vomit ? No , no vomit . I 'm talking to my friend . We can do Q and A later . Anything you say . Nice landing . I thought , " She 's coming home tonight . Pull up ! " I hit the ground ! I 'm hungry ! Want some ribs ? - I 'm here because it worked . - It worked ? Rough around the edges , but it worked ! That 's incredible ! No one can know , okay ?

Harry 's 400th consecutive hour in the laboratory . Close , but no cigar . How is it ? I 've been eating dust for 4 days ! So ? What were you celebrating ? Why wasn 't I invited ? We would 've , if you were here . Harry froze a chicken . Big deal . So has my butcher . I bet your butcher 's never brought the chicken back to life again . He what ? I swear ! I saw the chicken walking around . Harry 's a genius ! Which he proclaimed after the second bottle of champagne . So , what , this is some big government chicken conspiracy or something ? Don 't take this lightly . You can 't tell anyone . Just my mother . Helen , no , you can 't . - I was kidding . - Promise me . Yeah . I promise . I promise . - Not even under torture ? - Not even under torture . Not even under incredibly painful torture ? Don 't . This is a matter of national security .

I 'm living in a kind of daydream I 'm happy as a queen And foolish though it may seem To me , that 's everything The mere idea of you - Got it ! - Good catch ! When the man on second base touches him with the ball , he 's out . But why is he running ? Let 's start again . Here we go . This kid keeps staring at me . He likes you . Folks ? Everybody ? We have an announcement we 'd like to make . Next year BIanche celebrates her first Mother 's Day . Congratulations , Blanche . I 'd have told you but we weren 't sure . A toast ! A toast ! To Harry Junior ! To Harriet ! Look , it 's 1939 already ... . You usually get my thoughts before I do so you probably know what I 'll say . Helen will you marry me ? I 've been thinking ... . Danny , guess what ? - Colliers wants the pictures . - No kidding ? But it 's a rush thing . They need the pictures by Thursday . I must have them ready tomorrow . Which means I have to get to work . I have to go ! Wait ! What ? Want some pie ? We just had pie . Not blueberry . - How can you be hungry ? - I don 't know . Isn 't that the darndest thing ? Some blueberry pie . You don 't want some ? Just one . What 's going on ? What 's going on ? Nothing . I just want you to sit here with me while I eat . I 'll eat fast . You 're trying to break bad news to me , right ? You 're testing a rocket ? Where do you cook this stuff up ? There 's no rocket . Thank you . I have to go . Okay , I know . Call me later , okay ? Are you sure you got to go ? Are you sure you ' re okay ? What is it ? Let 's never leave this booth . - You 're acting nuts . - I am ? More than usual . I 'll see you later . What 're you still doing here ? Get out . I almost did it . I just couldn 't get the words past my throat . Well , you inspired me . Tell me something : When you asked Blanche- - Really ? On her head ? And she still said yes ? Just a sec , Frank . You must go outside . Come on , Danny . Goddamn it , Danny , will you open the door ? Please ? ! Hi , Harry . After 2 weeks , they said she wouldn 't wake up . That was 6 months ago . Doctors can be wrong . I talked to Dr. Morrison and Kelvin and Hastings and Collins . They all say the same thing . She said , " I 'll see you later " . That was the last thing she said . " I 'll see you later . " They ' re moving her to a chronic care facility in Santa Rosa . It 's a better place , I think . The doctors all agree nothing can be done . We used to play out by the lighthouse when we were kids . And she 'd say we 'd grow old together in that great house down the road . I don 't have one single memory without her . Nothing was real until she knew . Did you hear Charlie was canned from my project ? They found gin in his locker . He tried to deny it , but he was so sozzled he just passed out . Six days before the test and now he 's out . His timing was always beautiful . What test ? What test ? My project . My secret project . I was going to freeze a human . If you can call Charlie a human . How long ? A year . See , the beautiful thing about Charlie is , he had no life . What better way to iron out the kinks ? I can 't watch her die . I want to sleep for a year . - You 've been through a lot . - I 've thought it through . I 've been in the service 12 years . I 'm healthy . I 've got no family , nowhere to go . I know tests . I know experiments . It 's my job . I 'm perfect . You know that . I don 't even know if this thing 'll work for a year . Let me do it , please . I can 't think anymore . I can 't . Until she ... . Until it 's over . You said doctors can be wrong . That 's true . If she gets better wake me up . - Bring the internal to 20 . - 21 . 20 . Cancel pulse . Barometer is seven . - Do we have that ? - Copy . Reduce pressure . How 's the heart rate ? Looking good . Hit the valve . Needle at 6 . We 're in the black . Record date and time . 26 November , 1939 . 17 : 00 hours . All right , this is it . This is history . Got the dentist tomorrow ? Any good ? - You 're good company . - She said , yawning . - I 'm not . - You were about to . Sorry . Sorry about dinner . I just tend to burn things . No , it wasn 't really burned . Just , you know , well-done . It was significantly , dramatically well-done . We 'll do it again . Anytime . I know the maitre d ' . See you at the hospital , okay ? Air show this weekend , right ? You can invite John if you want . Maybe . We 'll see . 'Night . What 's this ? It 's parking . I thought we were going home . Chill out , freak ! I got to drop something off . Unlike you , I have responsibilities . But Mom said to take us home . Directly . That 's a real nice story , Felix . But Mom and Dad are in Vegas and I 'm not . You move from this car , and I swear to God one day I 'll put a poisonous snake in your bed . Dickhead ! I don 't think we can work within that time frame . We 'll have to postpone construction another week . And that 's at the least . We 're sorting through a lot of stuff . I can keep you updated . Oh , man ! Check it out ! Race you to the end ? Hurry , we got 10 seconds left . Hurry ! 10 , 9 8 , 7 ... . I 'm burning up ! It burns ! It burns ! You all right ? I 've got my guys on it around the clock . What can I do for you ? Give this to Samuels . He 's out front in the trailer . Thank you . Roger . Computers one , two , three . Ready . Activating the turbopower speed booster . Prepare for radioactive energy . Okay . How low are we ? - The needle says 65 . - 47 ! Ready to raise the periscope ? Ready to raise periscope . A leak ! Emergency ! What now ? Tighten the oxygen . Oh , my God ! Careful ! It 's cold . Look ! - He 's cold too . - Think he 's dead ? Get me out of this thing ! We went in and this metal thing opened with a dead guy inside ! Just shut up ! I swear ! He was really cold and he grabbed me and took my jacket ! You know , if I was cold , I 'd take your jacket also . Shut up ! You 're both pathetic ! Shut up ! Look , I am the boss in this car . Me ! I am ! And the boss says , shut up ! This isn 't just the finest excuse you 've ever come up with for losing a jacket ? It 'd be a great excuse , but it 's the truth . This frozen guy was there ! I saw him too . And I was there and I saw him ! I 'm sure this gentleman 's in there for a reason . Finish your peas . I would like Richmond 3 4 2 please . Excuse me ? Richmond 3-4-2 . 7-4-3-4-2 ? Please . I 'd like to speak to Harry Finley . Harry Finley , please . Sir , you 're missing 2 digits . You need 7 digits , you only gave me 5 . Oh , brother ! There 's no one here by that name . Then I need to talk to someone else in charge . Sir , I 'm sorry , but I can 't let you in here . No way . I know how I must look to you , okay ? Believe me , I wouldn 't let me in here either , if I was you . I must ask you to leave the premises . My name is Captain Daniel McCormick . Serial number 2-4-1 9-8-8-5-3-9 . I know your name too . Now , you look like a nice kid . But if you don 't get your supervisor out here now to talk to me I will make sure you pull guard duty for the rest of your military career ! Have you got that ? Have you got that ? You say it was registered as Project B , which stands for Buford ? Yes , that was the name of the chicken . That Finley first tested ? That 's correct . You woke up last night in the warehouse that we 're tearing down ? I know it sounds crazy , but ... . A little . Who was your supervising officer ? Boyle . Major David E. Boyle . I went where Harry used to live . Now it 's a place called Ralph 's there . I see . We don 't keep records that far back but our scientists would be fascinated . - This is classified information ? - Right , Harry told no one . Not even his employees knew . Just Harry and I. And I told one other person , but ... . Who ? She 's dead . I 'll call security . Swell ! Can I have a cigarette ? Me . I got something here I think you should do something about . I think you should probably meet . He says he was in a metal capsule in our warehouse for many years . Come over with some men . Pronto ! Because I think it 's going to be maybe a ... . It 's going to be ... . Sam ? Hold on one sec . Cancel it , Sam . I 'm not lying ! You 're lying . I swear . He said he 'd never seen so many cavities in one mouth . He wanted to send a sample of my saliva to a university . Your saliva ! Give it to me . Nat Cooper ? It 's the dead guy ! The dead guy ! Give me that ! Give me that bat ! I won 't kill you . I 'm not going to kill you , okay ? I won 't kill you . I just want to know how I got this jacket . All right . All right ! We went to the warehouse with Felix 's brother , Steven . And we were playing in there . And we saw that metal thing and thought it was a submarine . And we opened it up somehow and you were inside . Right ? There were no guards ? No doctors ? No , sir . Just junk . Junk . Hello , I was looking for a gentleman named Harry Finley . He used to live in this area . I thought you might be related to him . Thanks anyway , ma 'am . Thanks . Goodbye . Do you fellas do this a lot ? Mess with classified military experiments ? No , sir . This is the first time . My name 's Nat . This is Felix . What 's yours ? You want me to steal you some clothes from Dad 's closet ? Hello , sir . Excuse me . He said , " Leave a message " , then squealed . Hi , this is Nat . I 'm looking for a guy named Harry Finley . If you know where to find him , please call me at 555-2368 . Thank you . Answering machine . Machine ? I 'm talking to a machine . What the heck happened to the last 50 years ? I use this for my history . I got a B minus . It goes fast like this , or go slow . Zoom in . Look at that . Hold it ! What do you do , anyway ? Like for a job ? What 's your job ? Test pilot . - He 's a pilot ! - We found a pilot ! I 'm in the library on a Saturday . She 'll think I 'm a geek . She 's in here too . Oh , yeah . Look , just go talk to her . Just do it . Hey , Alice nice dress . Thanks . Looks like wallpaper . Good wallpaper . No problem . Bitchin ' nail polish . Looks like blood . How 's your summer going ? Fine , so far . I 'm just here doing some reading . " Little Women " . It 's good ! I had a huge bike accident . Really ? Thrashed my bike . Thrashed . Totally thrashed . I got a big cut too . Going to be a big scab . But I won 't pick . That 's cool . Thanks . Well , I got to go . See you . Cool . I 'm a geek . You must write the National Personnel Center , they deal with military records . They got a form . Takes like six weeks . 6 weeks is too long . This is urgent . I need to find this man today . It 's a matter of life and death for me . Please . Who ? Harry who ? Finley . Harry Finley . 1939 ? That 'd make him pretty old . Yeah , I guess it would . All right . I have a friend . He works at a locator service in San Antonio . Let me see what he can do . It might take a few days . It 's okay . If you call me here tomorrow after 12 , that 's when I get in . Ask for me , Debbie . I put my home number on there too . Just in case . You can stay here more than one night if you need to . Peanut butter , jelly and banana . Perfect . - Told you ! - Good . Drink ? Dessert . - This is to catch up more in history . - I got it for my birthday . You 'll break it open . Don 't do that . Pull it off like that . Put the straw in that hole like that . Drink box . Thanks . No sweat . Guys ? Mrs. Watson 's here . My mom . I figured . You like my tree house ? Swell . Cool ! See you . Stop it , Fred ! Stop it ! Stop it ! I want to talk ! Say , fella ! All right ! Take a walk and cool off . All right ? Go on . Come on . I was walking past and I heard you scream . You okay ? You 're shaking like a leaf . Sit down . So am I. You okay ? Good . This is yours ? It must have been his , but I 'm sure he 'd want you to have it . You 're bleeding . That 's just blood . Let me clean it up . That 's just a scratch . That 's not a scratch , it 's a gash . I 'm a nurse . I know a gash when I see one . Sit down . I think you may have just saved my life . Maybe . Prick ! I 've known assholes in my time , but this guy this guy could give lessons . This will sting . You see Fred is a drunk , which is the least of his problems . He 's got no spine and no decency . He 's a punk and I knew it the day I met him . I know what you 're thinking . I haven 't gone out with him in two years . Over that ! Every once in a while he comes back like those storms in Japan . You know , those violent ones that destroy the villages ? well , that 's Fred . Did you tell me your name ? I knew a Danny once . Worse than Fred . Well , maybe not . What do you do besides patrolling neighborhoods looking for signs of domestic problems ? I 'm an Air Corps test pilot . And in your off-time you save lives ? That 's it . My name 's Claire . In case you were curious . " A scout never shirks or grumbles at hardship . " What the hell is " shirks " ? Hey , guys . I 'd like you to meet someone . This is my son , Nat , and Felix . This is Daniel . You guys okay ? Fine . Daniel 's a pilot . - Cool ! - You 're kidding ! You found your jacket . Still think you saw a frozen guy ? Excuse me . What are you doing here ? A jerk showed up . I helped your mom get rid of him . Don 't worry , I 'm leaving . Wait , the couch is totally comfy . Or my room . The ceiling 's a glow-in-the-dark universe . Your mother won 't let a stranger stay in the house . Want to bet ? The toothpaste is in the mirror and there 's a new toothbrush there . Nat , would you get him a pillow , please ? Cool . For hot water , turn the faucet to 4 o 'clock and then when it gets warm turn it to 9 and then back to 11 . Sort of like a safe . It 's awfully kind of you to let me stay here . I figure if you wanted to kill me , you would have let Fred do it . Besides , you 've got an honest smile . Some are born with great legs . The rest of us must work at it . I used to do aerobics till I dropped , then I found Thighmaster . Great legs ! Every single time you squeeze Thighmaster you strengthen and tone . So it 's easy to squeeze your way to shapely hips and thighs . It 's called television . I know . I saw it at the World 's Fair in ' 39 . 'Night . Get up . That guy called back . He said he knows a Harry Finley . Lives an hour from here . What time is it ? 7 : 30 . - I got to go . - Wait ! We 're going to the Wings of Freedom . The air show . It 's near your friend . Morning . How was it ? You 're one of the kindest people I 've ever met . You haven 't seen my temper . Yeah , you haven 't seen that . Breakfast ? I must meet an old friend . Thanks , but I got to run . You sure ? I 'm a hell of a defroster . No . I 'm late as it is . Come to the air show . It 's so cool . He said he had to go . Goodbye , and thanks again . And good luck . You too . I guess that 's that . Thanks a lot . Thanks again . May I help you ? That 's right . I 'm sorry , sir . You 're not the ... . Are you okay ? You got a ticket ? You must buy a ticket over there . 12 dollars . - Can we look inside ? - Sure , go ahead . Hi , Debbie . This is Daniel , from yesterday . I was hoping you heard something . Couldn 't you rush it ? It 's just that- - Sure , I 'll try again later . Quit following me , okay ? Hi , Claire . Find anyone to rescue ? I 'm told that I listen exceptionally well . If you want to talk . You ever feel lost ? I invented it . It 's mine . My buddy was supposed to be here when I woke up . He used to live here . Now I can 't find him . I know that sounds desperate but he 's all I have left . You could always go home . I lost someone close to me , that 's why I left . That 's why I 've got no money or clothes or a place to stay . I just left . Where I 'd end up wasn 't on my mind . Everything okay ? John ! Daniel , this is John . John , this is Daniel . Pleased to meet you . Daniel will be staying with us for a couple days . Till he finds his friend . It 's good to know you , Daniel . Hi , this is Debbie . Leave a message , I 'll call you back . Hi , Debbie . This is Daniel McCormick . I 'm staying at 555-2368 . I 'd appreciate it , if you hear anything , to call me here . Thanks again for everything . Making dinner ? I got to do something . Maybe tomorrow , if you don 't find your friend you can teach me to fly . - That might be tough . - How come ? To begin with I don 't have a flight jacket . And secondly I have no plane . My father left when I was one . Thought you 'd want to know . I don 't think that 's any of my business . He hasn 't talked to us since . Thanks . Can I help out ? Chop up this onion . - Not the fingers , okay ? - I know , don 't worry . Anyway , this guy is covered in blood . Covered ! His heart is stopped . They must open him up . No time for procedure . So they open him up and I had to massage his heart . I actually held his heart and pumped it for him . And there 's a horrible accident on the 5 , with other injuries . This guy , whose heart I 'm pumping his eyes open . He looks at me and looks at his heart and says : " You 're holding my heart " What 'd you say ? " Yes , I am " The anesthesiologist almost fainted . That was a couple weeks ago . Today , when I got into work he sent me chocolates in a heart-shaped box . - Isn 't that a good story ? - Great . This is great . The scary thing is all this was in my cupboard , lurking . Thank you very much for taking the boys to that . We have a date ! Tonight ! Am I early ? I was trying out Daniel 's cooking . It 's good . Yeah . Want some ? I 'll just be a sec . Hi , guys . You 're a doctor ? That 's right . I understand you 're a pilot ? That 's right . Doctor , pilot ! Shit ! You all right ? I 've got a waterfall in my closet . Nat , get the spaghetti pot . Heck , that 's a leak ! It 's just a hole in the roof . Just ? We could do this another night . - Have you got hammers , nails , shingles ? - I have a hammer . Anything I can do ? I can go to the hardware store tomorrow if it 's still there fix this in a jiffy . Go to dinner , you two . Get out of here . Go on . You 'll be late . Wait ! The roof will be on Fred . Nine o 'clock . Thank you . I 'm starving ! Have fun ! We 're not talking about spare parts . - How do you explain yourself ? - Bad judgment call . If this becomes a media circus , you 're responsible . I 'm sure it will not come to that . I am right on top of it , sir . Can I help you ? I 'd like to sit here for a moment if that 's all right . Can I ask you something ? Shoot . Remember that girl in the library ? That girl in the library . Alice ? She 's really cool . Plus she 's really pretty . What 's your question ? Felix says I should make her jealous like his brother does with girls . Aren 't you a little young to be ... . Think about other stuff . I 'm ten ! I really like her . If I were you I 'd put her out of my mind . Just forget about her . Trust me . You okay ? Thanks for risking your life to save my underwear . I just lost my balance up there today . You sure you don 't want to talk to John ? He 's a good doctor . He seems like a nice guy . He is a nice guy . Nicest guy I know . This one 's great . You like her ? Who doesn 't like Billie Holiday ? You don 't have to put that on . Nat 's asleep . The girls at work just gave me this CD player for my birthday . I think the old records sound better somehow , don 't you ? There 's an EQ thing , but I can never figure out which button . She 's incredible , isn 't she ? I know what it feels like . I 'm sorry . I know . I 'm going to work . Nat , wake up ! What ? I was wrong . Before , about Alice . I told you to forget about it . What about her ? You know how you want to know what you should do ? You must tell her . ... when your heart pounds and you 're nervous- - You know what I mean ? Just let go . What do you mean ? Let go . Tell her how you feel . It 's hard , but you got to do it ! How ? You know that stuff you told me ? Tell that stuff to her . Open your heart . Sing to her ! Sing ? Tell her everything . Sing to her . The sooner the better . Because you might not get another chance . You follow ? Good . Good . It 's late . Good . Go to sleep . I just wanted to tell you I was wrong . I thought that you should know . Thanks . Good night . It 's me . Why are you here ? You are my sunshine My only sunshine You make me happy When skies are gray You 'll never know , dear How much I love you Please don 't take my sunshine away Is this a prank ? No , sir , this is very serious . Sorry to disturb you . I 'm Nat Cooper . I 'm in love with your daughter . I see her in class every day and I just really like her a lot . And that 's the truth . Go home . - But , sir ! - Good night . This is Cameron . They found what ? You 're leaving ? I got this for you . Falcon Control , magnetos on . Now prime the engines for a few seconds , so fuel gets to the engines . Set your brakes . Right ! Don 't say , " right " , say , " check " . " Right " gets confusing . - Check ! - Right . Starter engine on . Okay , oil pressure 's coming up . Mixture 's still rich . Give it a little throttle . We 're rolling . Check flight controls . Make sure they 're free and correct . Set flaps for takeoff . Just a quarter . Ready ? Throttle on . All the way . Now we ' re moving . Back pressure . More back pressure . - Increasing . - Yes . Okay , we 're climbing . We 're up ! Lift gear . Gear up . Flaps up . Okay , we 're flying . Come back to the middle . - Where 's the airport ? - Over there . Let 's go back there . Smooth now . Smooth . We lost the right engine ! Feather props , cut mixture . Get ready to lean on the rudder . We must find a place to land . There ! A field . A field , okay . Looks okay to me . Stay calm now . Maintain optimum glide speed . Slowly pull your power back . And get in a notch of these flaps . Just a notch ! Okay . Will we make it ? Gear down . Gear down . Check . Airspeed , 135 miles per hour . Full flaps . Watch the horizon . Pull back . Not too much ! You 'll flare up . Just watch the horizon . Watch out for the tree ! And the cows . And the potholes ! Step on the brakes . Slowly ! Too much ! Slowly . If you can land a B-25 you can do anything . Thanks a lot . No , thank you for the jacket . You 're welcome . This tree house gets your back . Sure you won 't stay ? What 's happening ? ! Help ! - Blood pressure ? - 90 over 60 . Pulse is 112 . What is it ? I don 't know . Oh , God ! I 'm not making this up . - McCormick in Emergency- - - McCormick ? It 's the FBI . This guy 's in trouble . I 'm confused . Look at those indices . What kind of blood activity is that ? Dr. Cameron , Lieutenant Colonel Wilcox . How are you ? You okay ? Yes , I 'm just not the best flier . I hear you have some good news . Yes , sir . Some very good news . Quit following me ! Oh , brother ! I 'm still here , huh ? You look terrible . Yeah , but not bad for a guy my age , right ? It 's not possible . Claire , I was born in 1907 . I know . I felt the same when Harry told me the idea . Harry Finley ? You know him ? A woman left a message . I thought it was a wrong number . It 's still on the machine . Maybe he was exposed to some form of radiation . He 's got what looks like a form of progeria . I 've never seen this . He is aging ! - Will he live ? - I don 't know . - We must get him out . - The FBI is coming ! I know ! Stall them . Please ? John , trust me . Fine ! Jump in . - Who are those guys ? - FBI . - I can walk . - Just shut up and look sick . - There 's something you should know . - We 're in a hurry . McCormick has been moved . Open the door . He 's in the west wing . Follow this corridor to the end . Room 144 . I 'm okay , Claire . I 'm all right . What the hell is going on here ? Hello , I 'm looking for a man named Harry Finley . He was a scientist . His wife 's name was Blanche . He was from Chicago . Do you know him ? That 's my father . Is he home ? I 'm sorry , but my father is dead . He lived here for a few months but he died before I was born . You must mean another man . I was his best friend . Susan Finley 's address is 14 Cypress Pond Road . Her father found the problem 2 months after McCormick volunteered . Finley died in a chemical fire trying to save his friend . Operations claimed McCormick was killed as well . No investigation . The project was forgotten , when the war started . You 're telling me McCormick was misplaced for 50 years ? It seems so . Inventory says the capsule was a water heater . My God ! Here they are . That 's them , all right . Irreversible . Here . These might help . We should go back to the hospital . I 'm sure they can help . That 's her , isn 't it ? Helen . Is that your child ? We were never married . That 's me in the picture . I was two . That 's impossible . She died before you were born . Helen 's alive . - That 's where we grew up . - I know . - When did she move there ? - 7 years ago . After her husband died . She was married ? Come on ! I can 't thank you enough . Put the car in drive ! - Are we going as fast as we can ? - I 'm trying ! This car won 't make it . I need a plane . Hold on . All right ! Holy cow ! You drive like me ! Hold on ! - You must pay ! - Dropping off a pilot ! Stay here . Goodbye . Remove the wheel blocks , I 'll never ask you another favor . You 're holding my heart . Just get out of the way ! Excuse me . Watch it ! Excuse me ! Look , he hasn 't seen this woman in 50 years ! Hasn 't he been through enough ? You 'll get your plane back . Just leave him alone ! - We won 't hurt him . - Then why do you want him ? A cup of coffee ? A chat ? Excuse me . Walk this way , please . Do you know how far the next star system is ? 100 years . You can 't make that trip without this kind of technology . We 're decades behind where Finley got in 1939 . Daniel 's the only link between Finley 's work and my own . That 's not true . Everything you ever wanted to know about freezing someone . Oh , my God ! What 're you doing ? You forgot your jacket . Put your belt on . Can we at least talk to them ? On the radio ? They 're not transmitting . We have the craft on radar . I 'm going to see the capsule . Call Dr. Reese and have him come here . I also want everything that the hospital did on McCormick .

 - the name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now ... Well , let 's just say , " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - Jones , Straight , Reba , tritt . - All the greats . - All the great whats ? - Country singers- - My brother sent these to me . These are antiques . They used to be my grandpa 's . - I thought you and your brother were close ? - We are close . Hey , I happen to love country music , - I 'll have you know . - Yeah , you would . - Warning . You are exceeding the speed limit by 240 % and rising . - Hey , oh , that sounds really dangerous . - What do you say we play a few tracks ? - Gee , that 'll be swell , haldane , But cruisers don 't come equipped with sound systems . - Grandpa 's disc player . - Haldane , we 're on duty ! Man , you 're doin ' the paperwork on this one . - [ music playing ] - Haldane ! - I didn 't touch it , honest . Man , this guy is whacked out of orbit . - Warning . You are exceeding the speed limit by 300 % and rising . - Drop and drool . - Please keep a minimum of two hands on the controls at all times . - This is the police ! Reduce your speed and descend to street level . This is your last warning . - Weird music- - I like it ! - Man , what 's he up to now ? - No , he 's not . - He is . - I 'm gonna name my first Ulcer after this guy . - Ah , good afternoon , officers . - What the hell you think you 're doin ' anyway ? Hey ! - I want to shoot you . - Yeah , well I got a better idea . Why don 't you try these on for size . - Oh , handcuffs are no good , Officer . You see , I 'm Marcus droon . Strongest Taryn in demeter city . Maybe the strongest Taryn in- - ugh ! No ! No ! - I have a bad feelin ' about this . - It 's a hell of a way to beat a speeding ticket . [ country music playing ] - What 's that awful noise ? - That " Awful noise , " as you call it , - is classic country music . - Classic ? - You worry me , haldane . - I do ? - Not in the way you think . - Ah , I see . Now you know what I 'm thinkin ' . - Do you go out of your way to annoy me , or does it just come naturally ? - Enough you two . What about our vaporized driver , Jane ? - Right . Take a look at the late Marcus droon 's I.D. No arrests- - No convictions . - Traffic tickets ? - Nothing . He was a librarian- - Couldn 't be cleaner . - Or deader . One minute he 's on top of the world . The next poof , hot air . - Sounds like too much flash . - " Flash ? " - That 's street jargon for demeter 's latest drug of choice . Users love it until they o.D. , then boom ! - No more user . - Tell me about it . Thanks a lot , Jane . We 'll check with his landlady , and see what she can tell us about him . - Hi , I just can 't believe this ! Marcus was always a very quiet , respectable young Taryn . So shy , really . You know , he worked at the demeter city library . In fact , in the entire time he stayed here , he never once took a vacation . He really was a perfect tenant . Kept himself to himself , never caused problems , or made any noise . Paid his rent on time- - - Uh-Huh- - Look did he have any , um , close friends , or relatives ? Any regular visitors ? - He was a real loner . His parent 's passed away , oh , years ago . He didn 't really like people . I suppose if you stop to think about it , I was the only real friend he had . - I 'm sure he 'll be missed . - Brogan ? - Yeah . - " H.E.-11 , " does that mean anything to you ? - No , not offhand- - Wait , what 's this ? - Peru ? - I need to make a report . - Yeah , we 'll be with you in a minute , sir . - No , now . - I need to make a report . - We 're busy , sir . - No , now ! I 'm sorry . It 's just- - Well my girlfriend 's dealing flash , and I don 't know what to do about it . - You can start by givin ' us a name . - Pola vad moonacki . - And the address ? - That 's the problem . We got in a fight and she ran off . - How about a description ? - I got a picture . - Oh , even better . - If you see her , maybe you could tell her , well , you know , that I 'm sorry . - Yeah , sure- - Hey , slomo ! Slomo , run an I.D. Scan on this . - Oh , and your name ? - According to slomo , this pola character was last registered in a flop house in the wharf district . - Nice neighborhood . If she 's dealing down there , she must be pretty low on the totem pole . - You can 't get much lower than dealing drugs to begin with . - Who is it ? - Demeter city police ! - Identification ? Okay . - Pola vad moonacki ? We 've got a warrant to search your premises . - on the suspicion of dealing flash . - Flash ? - Don 't play dumb . Your boyfriend told us all about it . - Boyfriend- - What boyfriend ? - Man , we walked right into that one . - Dumb . - You feel dumb now , wait ' til the captain hears our report . - Forensics confirmed it . The files Brogan and haldane found in droon 's apartment are 100 % flash , aka " H.E.-11. " And now it doesn 't look much , does it ? Just a tiny , little bottle of bright blue liquid . Now , I want you all to see exactly what this stuff does . Sergeant fredo ? Cell security cams recorded This earlier today . Meet Emilia setrick . Age 52 . A grandmother . No criminal record . She was arrested this morning for robbing a jewelry store . With this . She said something about breaking through the wall . Said she had the hardest head in demeter city . - I think this is where we came in . - Hit the streets , people . Dealers , distributors , manufacturers . Anybody and everybody involved in the flash trade . I want them closed down and locked up , and I want it done yesterday ! - Took and I have been doing some research on the chemical makeup of flash . One its key components tetra-Preline . - Only two companies on altor report this stuff . Which one do you want- - Intercam or camtricks ? - Which one do you want ? - Haldane ? - What ? - Don 't do this . - Do what ? - You know exactly what . - I do ? - Don 't answer my questions with questions . - I hesitate to mention in front of two police officers , But , um , h.E.-11 , or flash , as you call it , was developed here at intercam . But , uh , before you run me in , allow me to say that we discontinued that research as soon as we discovered the drug 's lethal side effect . We lost over three million credits on that program and we still haven 't recovered . - Why were you researching it in the first place ? - Well we were trying to develop an ego-Enhancer . An artificial confidence booster for the low and self esteem . Unfortunately , when the concentration of h.E.-11 reaches a certain critical level in the blood , it triggers a chain reaction . Well essentially the blood plasma converts to - Trioxy lycosone . - Isn 't that like zimtel ? - Yes , only less stable . Body heat alone can set if off . Now ironically , the drug is perfectly safe when used in moderation- - Problem is , when the user 's confidence is boosted above a certain level- - - Moderation goes out the window . - exactly . - Any idea how h.E.-11 got on the streets ? - I can only think of one possibility . It 's really pure conjecture . - All right- - Come on , doc . Cut to the Chase . - We 're talkin ' about saving lives here , doctor Jansen . - When the h.E.-11 Program was canceled , my chief Chemist left rather suddenly . Perhaps you should talk to her . Her name is pola vad moonacki . - Pola vad Moonacki- - Wait a second . I thought so . Orrin and beezle just filed a kidnapping report on her . - Could you upload us that report , fredo ? - Sba . - Thanks . - I hate coincidences . - Yeah , what do we got here ? Criminal record , none . Prior drug history , none . Sound like a typical flash dealer to you ? - Well , no , but it 's the only lead we 've got . - don 't forget , peru . - You take peru , I 'm gonna take pola . - Let me out of here ! Somebody ! Anybody ! - Scream all you want , pola . Selenium . Completely soundproof . - I won 't work for you again , Carmel . You perverted my research . - You accepted our money . - until I found out you were selling h.E.-11 on the street , unlicensed . - Huh , pola . It takes years to get a license . We simply had to cut some corners . - And kill innocent people ? - We were as disappointed with that unfortunate side-Effect as you . You are going to eliminate that side-Effect . - I won 't do it- - you can 't make me . - Do you know this address ? Oh ? I see . Well , then you won 't mind if morgo were to say , " Dismember everyone who lives there . " Welcome back , pola . - See you later , prime ancients . I 'm planet-Bound . - Yo , wait a minute , pal . - I 'm staying at taryck 's , dad . The tournaments running all weekend . - I spoke with inca this morning , it 's fine . - Bye , sweetie . - Mom . - Have fun . - Take no prisoners , Matt . - Dad ? Zil says I really need to talk to you . - Sure , hon ' - - what 's up ? - Well there 's this class project I got to write . It 's called , " a parent 's day . " - " a parent 's day , " huh ? - Mm-hmm . And I 'm gonna write all about what a great policeman you are . - Mm . - All right , all right- - I 'll ask him . - don 't be so pushy . - Um , ask me what , honey ? - Well the point of the project is to actually see what goes on in your day . - the station 's not a very good place for a little kid , honey . - I 'm sorry . - I 'm not a little kid ! - I 'm almost 11 ! - Yeah , I know . But it 's just not a real great idea . I mean , why don 't you write about mom 's work ? - If I wanted to write about mom 's work , I would 've asked her . Zil says you aren 't being very nice , daddy . - I think zil 's got a point . - So creons , if you suffer from CREON Cheropidic disorder just Dial feet . That 's f-E-e-T . - Coming up next , erdie Grisham with the slam ball highlights of the week . And his special guest , the greatest crossover roll the game has ever seen . - What 's a peru ? - It 's a country on earth . - Ah , yes . Your arbitrary political divisions . When will you humans wake up to planetary govern , but honestly . - in this case , it 's a Dial code . Peru translates to 7378 . We found it in droon 's apartment . - and it just so happens to be the private internal number of our good Buddy , doctor Henry Jansen . - Ah . - It will give you all the confidence you never had , - my dear . - Thank you very much . - Your welcome . It looks the same . - I 've altered the ratio and lengthened the catalization period . - Morgo , bring that lizerette . Margo , do you still have that address ? - I know I 'm close . Give me a few more days , please ? - You 've got 26 hours . Or rather your parent 's do . [ screaming ] - Nice try , pola . [ laughing ] flash don 't work on morgo . - This is rather stupid , Henry . - the cops have been to see me . They may be tapping my line . - are they on to us ? - They 're asking the right questions . Which means whether pola 's cracked the DESIGN flaw or not , we 've got to go . - I 've given her 26 hours and plenty of motivation . - All right- - I 'll clean up at intercam . As soon as she 's done , dismantle everything and load it into the transit . Make sure we have enough fuel to get to the planet danai . We 'll take the air shuttle from there . I think earthlings will enjoy a little ego boosting . - and pola ? - When she 's done , give her to morgo . - Um , take these to the disposal , Tanya , then I want you to wipe the computer files . - Dr. Jansen ? - Officer haldane , Brogan . Delighted to see you again . How may I help you ? - We got a warrant to search the premises . - We 've tested every vat , every flask , every test tube in every lab at intercam . Nothing . - So what we 're saying here is that we have doctor Henry Jansen in the lock-up , and we have no evidence . I hope you fellas got somethin ' up your sleeves besides arms . - Captain ? Brogan and haldane asked us to check out some addresses from Jansen 's database . The guy 's a real Prince . - We thought you might like to see what we found down in zone seven . - Plus , a dealer who 's willing to name names . - the secret of our success . - Timing . - Captain ? Jansen 's got a Visitor- - One Carmel Matthews . - Sounds like an invitation to me , gentleman . - to be honest , Henry , I don 't know why I 've come . Our relationship ended so long ago . - I 'm glad you did . Carmel , and I had no where else to turn . - This is all so alarming . You of all people behind bars . - It was all some kind of horrible mistake . Sweetheart , I want you to know that I am innocent . Pola must have set me up . - How dare you mention her name in my presence ! - Hey , Hey , hey ! Behave . - and to think I actually felt sorry for you . And all you could do is talk about pola . - Ain 't love grand ? - Yes , Officer haldane . Love is grand . - that 's easy for you to say , lieutenant , but you 're not dealing with the dirt bags out there in the street . - Stand by for more exciting police action - In demeter city blues . - Honey ? Do we have to ? - After these words from our local sponsor . - No , we don 't have to . - something I did ? - No . Just something you didn 't do . Well , you know Trina 's mother is taking her to moon station one where she works as an astrophysicist . And Yolanda 's father is taking her to the transit factory where he works . - Yeah , okay , okay- - I get the picture . Why don 't you take her to the hospital ? - She doesn 't want to go to the hospital . - Honey , if I walk in to the 88th with a kid on my arm , podly 's gonna cut me off at the knees . - Patrick Brogan . Your captain is not the issue here and you know it . - All right- - I admit it . I want my kid to be something more than just some cop walking ' a beat . - You 're not just some cop walking ' a beat . You 're my cop walking ' a beat . And besides that , I think it 's a little early to be worried about her career choices , don 't you ? - I know what you 're doin ' ? - Hmm ? - Yeah . - the answer 's still " No . " - It is ? - I mean it- - Absolutely no way . - Mm-hmm . - it won 't work . - How old is she ? - Ten , almost 11 , captain . - Ah . My daughter was the same way at that age . Bet she watches all the cop shows , right ? - Yes , sir- - That 's my Liz . - Well I have to tell you I did the same thing myself . Took my daughter to the station for a few hours . Gave her the guided tour- - Usual stuff . I don 't see why you shouldn 't do it , too . But only for a couple of hours , right ? - at most , captain . By the way , um , when you did that with your daughter- - - Ah , it worked out great . She 's a detective over in the 38th now . - Hey , Brogan ! They finally found a partner tough enough for ya , huh ? - Space police officers are chosen for their exceptional sense of humor . - Wow . Tremo . - Jane . Tooki . Say " Hello " to Liz . - Hiya , Liz . - So are you gonna be Brogan 's new partner ? - Officer 's are also chosen for their originality . - Pretty tough requirements , huh ? - Hey , look what we found for you in storage . - Ooh . - welcome to the D.C.P.D. , officer Brogan . - We ought to use you on the recruitment posters . - something wrong , Brogan ? - No , I was just gonna tell Liz How much dull and Boring paperwork we have to do . - the paperwork is Boring , right ? - But it 's more than made up for by the excitement - Of high speed chases . - Catching criminals . - Coffee and donuts . - Sweet . - Come on , Liz- - We got work to do . - morgo ! I really could use some muscle in here . You really should push on , dear . You 're running out of time . - and so is mommy and daddy . - Finally decided to show up for work , haldane ? - Yeah . I thought an APPEARANCE would be in order . - I know I 'll regret this , but may I ask why you crawl in here at least 20 minutes late - Almost every morning ? - I say it 's simple . I 'm still on earth time . I 'm used to a 24 hour day , with one moon . Here I get a 26 hours day with I don 't know how many moons . I think my internal Clock 's still a little confused . - So is your excuse . - Hey ! - I think she likes you . - You think so ? Nah- - What are you doin ' here ? Did Brogan put in for a new partner ? - Don 't worry , Jack . We 'll let you go on patrol once in a while . - Late again , haldane ? - Uh , sir , uh , yeah . - I 'd love to hear your excuse . If you can spare the time , that is . My office . - [ knocking ] - Excuse me , Officer ? - What do you want ? - How do you feel ? - Okay . No , I don 't- - I feel like , great ! - Shh ! Keep your voice down . Now will you please open this door ? - No way . - but you 're great . You 're the greatest police officer the force has ever had . If you open this door , guess what would happen . - You 'd escape . - right . But you would recapture me , like that . Because you are that terrific . Open the door . - All right , man . But I 'm gonna recapture you , just like that . - Thanks . - Your face does not match my records . Identify immediately . - Officer Liz Brogan . Lieutenant Brogan 's new partner . - Uh , don 't move . I-I-I 'm finding your picture now . Thank you , uh , officer Brogan . Report to records at five for a voice print and a dna scan- - Goodbye . - Bye . Boss giving you a hard time ? - Yeah . - Always bugs you by doing things by the book , But they don 't have to deal with the dirt bags out there .

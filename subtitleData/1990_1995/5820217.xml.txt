 We got a fire off County Road D7 , two miles west of the Canyon Ridge intersection . Suggest we dispatch fire crews . Over . This is Deputy Wright . Do you copy ? Son of a ... Sir ? Sorry to disturb you , but we 've picked up an identified bogey . I think you should see the replay for yourself . It tripped the fence at 23.17 off the coast of Connecticut , sir . Initial trajectory was north by northwest , then it went crazy . - What about other aircraft or missile testing ? - No known aircraft can manoeuvre like this . Whatever it was dropped off the screen at 24.18 , sir . Hit ground just west of Lake Michigan , outside Townsend , Wisconsin . The impact-prediction team calculated impact at over 800mph . I 've told Chief Koretz to start her report . - Use these tapes to ... - Negative . She tracked a meteor. its aberrant movement was due to instrument malfunction . - But , sir ... - Your report will reflect these facts . Clear ? Yes , sir . Good . Code Indigo Delta Echo Niner . I have a confirmed fallen angel in sector 87 . Mobilise Operation Falcon immediately . Hello ? X-Files Season 1 Episode 10 - Fallen Angel They will have no comment until the government investigation is completed . Government officials remain vague about the toxic cargo that has caused the immediate evacuation of Townsend , Wisconsin 's 12,000 residents . Speculation here has centred on a shipment of toxic waste . Then what happened if it wasn 't a train wreck ? Mr Mulder , the continental US is surrounded by an electronic fence that reaches 15,000 miles into space . We use it to track and monitor the 7,087 man-made objects that orbit the Earth . Last night at 23.17 that fence was breached . This morning at 01.00 Operation Falcon went into effect , led by Colonel Calvin Henderson , the Air Force 's premier reclamations expert . Reclamations ? During the Cold War his job was to prevent technologies from downed US aircraft from getting into Soviet hands . He 's ... part of a crash-retrieval unit ? Quick response . I 'd say you have ... 24 hours before the entire area is sanitised . After that , be like nothing ever happened . Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! On the double ! - Thank you , sir . - Thank you . Get it going . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - All right , let 's move out ! - Roadblock needs to be in place . All right. I 'll get right on it , sir . - You 're late. lt 's gonna be dark in a half-hour . - We had a flat outside the perimeter , sir . There 's a briefing at 22.00 , but first go to headquarters for live rounds . Live rounds , sir ? - Got a problem with that ? - No , sir ! We were told this is a drill . - They told you wrong . - Sir . OK , everyone out ! Come on , people ! Light a fire ! You just made the worst mistake of your life , Agent Mulder . I think you knocked out a filling . I 'll see to it you pay the price for putting my men at risk . Since when does taking pictures put anyone 's life at risk ? You violated a US government quarantine and that 's a federal crime . A quarantine ? is that what you call this ? We 're trying to contain an ecological disaster . That 's a lot of fire power just to protect Mother Nature . I have my orders . And the licence to execute them as I see fit . I suggest you forget what you saw or what you think you saw for your own wellbeing . You 've got a downed craft in those woods , sir , and troops carrying live rounds . We both know what 's out there ! - Come on , move it . - That 's right , buddy . Get goin ' . Get in there . You MUFON or CUFOS ? Do you mind if I sit down ? No . Let me guess . You 're with that new group . CSlCOP , right ? Say no more . You 're a cautious man . Trust no one - very wise . After what happened to JFK , I understand completely . Let me introduce myself . Max Fenig. I 'm with the National Investigative Committee of Aerial Phenomena . NlCAP . Pleased ... pleased to make your acquaintance . I wish we could shake on it , you know ? Firm grip . Look right in the eye . You learn a lot about a guy that way . Can I ... Can I ask you a question ? Go ahead . Did you see anything ? Did you get close ? Me , I saw nothing. I didn 't see anything ! Nada . Zip . 100 yards past the roadblock they nailed me. I have no idea how they did it . I 'm telling you , it 's like the Roswell cover-up all over again . What makes you so sure there 's something out there ? Same thing that makes you so sure . I didn 't order room service . This isn 't funny , Mulder . - Did you meet Max ? - Who ? Max from NlCAP . They must have released him . Another intrepid soul in search of a close encounter . is that what this is about ? What else ? Try explaining that to Section Chief McGrath . He stepped over Blevins , ordering a full inquiry with a recommendation ... Mulder , he wants to shut down the X-Files and he wants you out of the Bureau . What else is new ? I don 't understand you , Mulder ! Why you 're always defying protocol , ignoring jurisdiction . Because I know what I saw , Scully . There were no train tracks , so how could it have been a derailed container ? Because it wasn 't . What you saw was not a toxic spill . But it wasn 't a UFO either . OK , I 'm all ears . What was it ? It was a downed Libyan jet with a nuclear warhead . Over US airspace ? They picked up low-grade levels of radiation , so the plutonium casing may have cracked . So to avoid mass panic ... - You really believe that story ? - That story happens to be highly classified . A highly classified lie . - They 're searching for someone , Scully . - Then it 's probably the pilot . You think they 'd roll out all this material for one Libyan fighterjock ? Besides , no human pilot walked away from the wreckage I saw . Maybe he ejected . Maybe . You can 't be serious . As long as we 're in beautiful downtown Townsend , why not ? - The hearing is tomorrow at ten o 'clock . - That gives us 24 hours to investigate . My assignment is to bring you back , not to dig you in deeper . The Last Detail , starring Dana Scully . What 's going on ? Looks like housekeeping hasn 't been here yet . What ... Max ? Get your hands up ! - Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! - Max ? My apologies . Forgive me , please . l-l-l 'm a curious man. I had to know . - Know what ? - lf it was really you . But you don 't know me . Last night was the first time we met . Not true . NlCAP have followed your career closely ever since you got put on the X-Files . - Followed my career ? How ? - With the Freedom of information Act . Your travel expenses are a matter of public record . So , this must be the ... enigmatic Agent Scully . - How did you recognise me ? - l saw your picture in a trade publication , and I read your article in Omni about the Gulf Breeze sightings . - l published that under a pseudonym . - MF Luder. I know . MF Luder 's an anagram for F Mulder . You really didn 't think that would fool us , did you ? I didn 't think anybody was paying attention . Somebody 's always paying attention , Mr Mulder . Amazing . Amazing ? Hardly ! You wanna see something amazing , come with me . " The enigmatic Dr Scully . " This is my ... Right this way . Excuse the mess . OK . Where 's those ... Let me turn this off . They 're right here . Here they are . Latest crop circle photos from Project Argus . Huh ? - Your opinion : fact or fraud ? - Fraud . How do you explain the blisters on the plants ? It 's either a weathering effect or the plant 's reaction to being in one position . - You 've read the literature . - l try to keep up . - What about ... - Max , you had something to show us . Oh , yeah , yeah . The Wolf 's Ear 2000 . You ever hear of this ? Yeah . Wolf Industries supplies the ClA with surveillance equipment . State-of-the-art search and intercept . 100 channels per second . I 'm jacked into local fire and police departments , cellular phone pathways , and , when the weather 's right , air-traffic control from Whitmarsh Air Force Base . What have you got ? Mobile-unit broadcast in scan mode . Townsend Sheriff 's Department two nights ago . We got a fire off County Road D7 , two miles west of the Canyon Ridge intersection . Suggest we dispatch fire crews . Over . This is Deputy Wright . Do you copy ? And then this , 35 minutes later , presumably from the fire crew . Reception got wiggy for some reason . This is Unit 53 . Man down . Request medevac . I said , request medevac ! You 're breaking up ... barely ... bad , very bad . Wait a sec . What the hell ... ? Charlie ! We got a situation here ! We put up a tight net . Yes , sir . Every inch of ground is being covered , dug up , squeezed and sifted . No , sir , it will not get away . Not this time . Mrs Wright ? Hi , I 'm Fox Mulder . This is Dana Scully . We 're from the fbi . We have a few questions about your husband . He 's dead ! What else is there to know ? - l 'm sorry about your husband . - Oh , please ! - Mrs Wright , we want to help you . - Then leave me alone ! - Why won 't you let us help you ? - l don 't know anything ! Don 't you understand ? They won 't even release the body so I can give him a proper burial , OK ? The government can 't do that . - l 'm sure if we appeal to ... - No ! You can 't . You 're entitled to the truth . I can 't afford the truth . They said if I spoke to anyone , they would withhold my husband 's pension . And I have a child to take care of . Picking up an extremely high-frequency signal . 200,000 megahertz . Sir . Target on the northeast side . Foot speed : 7mph , sir . - Beta team ? - Copy . Target entering your section . Search and destroy . Repeat : search and destroy . Yes , sir . - Jackson ? - Nothing . Must have been an animal . I 'm sorry , but unless you have a subpoena , I can 't discuss patient information . So Jason Wright was your patient ? I have nothing more to say about this . What about to his wife and child ? Would you have anything to say to them ? Because whoever got to you also got to her . They must have made some big threats . What 'd they hold over your head ? Your medical licence ? The Irs ? - l hate fascists . - Excuse me ? The men who came in here , the way they pushed us all around . Dr Oppenheim , tell us about the deputy . You saw him that night , didn 't you ? Yes , and three others from a fire crew . They were DOA with fifth - and sixth-degree burns to over 90 % of their bodies . But they weren 't like any burns I 've seen , and they took the bodies before we could perform pathology . Did you note any cadaveric heat rigor or heat stiffening ? Yes , there was quite a bit of flexion in the limbs . How do you know so much ? I did my residency in forensic medicine , so ... Dr Oppenheim , could those burns have been caused by ionising radiation ? I hadn 't thought ... I suppose it 's possible , if the exposure were sufficiently intense . Say the men died from radiation exposure . - Can 't it have been from a nuclear warhead ? - l 've read about these kinds of burns . - So have I , in Hiroshima at ground zero . - l mean close-encounter mortalities . I have a stack of X-Files reporting the same clinical results . I don 't claim to know all the answers , but if we don 't make the OPR inquest by tomorrow there may not be any more X-Files . Start an iv here . D5 , half-normal saline at 150 . - Tell us what happened out there . - Mulder , it has nothing to do with you . Wrong , Colonel . We both want the same thing , only you want it dead . Can 't you see by chasing it like an animal you leave it no choice but to defend itself ? How many more have to die before you rethink your approach ? Listen to me , cos l 'm not wasting another breath on this . - lf you two aren 't outta here in 30 seconds ... - Agent Scully stays here ! We 're undermanned , she 's a doctor . She stays . - lf that 's OK with you . - Of course . Doctor , if you don 't mind , just take care of my men and let me do my work , OK ? Outside this emergency room you can do whatever you want , but here I call the shots . Assuming , of course , you want me to take care of your men . Get this man out of my sight . Yes , sir . Where do I scrub up ? Max ? Hey , Max ? Max ? Hey , Max . Who are ... who are you ? Max , it 's me . Fox Mulder . You OK ? What are you doing here ? You were having some kind of seizure . Seizure ? That 's impossible . You were lying on the floor unconscious , convulsing . That 's odd . I haven 't had an episode in seven years , not since I went on medication . - Let 's get you to the hospital . - No ! I mean , it 's not necessary . - Sure ? - Yeah , I 've lived with epilepsy all my life . I 'm not in any danger . Yeah , it started in South Dakota when I was ten . The doctor said I must have incurred a head injury. I don 't remember ever hitting my head . When you have seizure , you have no memory of it ? As a kid I used to wake up in strange places with no idea where l was or how I got there . I 'm sorry. I got ... - l gotta ... I gotta go sleep . - All right . Rough night , huh ? It was terrible . We lost all but two . They 're still in critical condition , on their way to the burn unit at Johns Hopkins . So what do you think , Scully ? What 's going on out there ? I don 't know . And , under other circumstances , I would like to find out , but we have a plane to catch in just over an hour . I want you to take a look at something first . - What ? - Max . There 's an unusual incision behind his left ear. I 've seen this incision twice before . Two women 1,000 miles apart . No way of knowing each other , no relation . Both claim to have been abducted by aliens . Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee ? Mulder , the man is taking powerful anti-psychotic drugs. I saw them in his RV . - They 're for his epilepsy . - Not all of them . Dilantin is an anticonvulsant , but Mellaril is used exclusively to treat schizophrenia . More than likely , Max is delusional . You don 't understand , Scully . Max doesn 't believe he was abducted by aliens. I believe he was . Now , could you at least look at the scar and give me your medical opinion ? OK . You pack , I 'll take a look at Max on the way to the airport . Sir , I have flash traffic at 24.18 . Repeated calls for lD go unanswered and it 's not in the orbital or suborbital inventory . - 24.18. lsn 't that where ... ? - Same exact spot , sir . - Though I am reading a larger craft this time . - Meteor , Miss Koretz . A much larger meteor , ... sir . - Whitmarsh Tracking SSC . We have a bogey . - Hold on a second . We have a confirm . Whitmarsh Air Force Base is tracking . - Where is it ? - Sector 35 , 53,000ft , zero velocity . Well , sir , the meteor seems to be hovering over a small town in eastern Wisconsin . We have a bogey . Confirm . Come on , Mulder . Let 's get this over with . Hey , Max ? Max ! Hey , Max ? Mulder , look at this . What is that ? Blood ? Falcon Patrol reporting unidentified trespass . Repeat : Falcon Patrol reporting unidentified trespass at the waterfront . Dock 7 . - Mulder ! - Come on ! Where do you think you 're going ? If we go to the airport now , we might make the plane , which would give you a chance of defending yourself . Think about it , Scully . Max is a gypsy , a nomad , right ? Yeah . So what ? So he intercepted Deputy Wright 's last call , which means he was here in Townsend the night of the crash . Of all the places he could have been , he was here . Don 't you think it 's more than a coincidence ? If Max was abducted , that would explain his obsessions . And if we figured that out , Henderson has as well . D 'you have the keys ? - Don 't do this ! - Sir , we have the target. lt 's just a civilian . Negative , Falcon Patrol . Take him with extreme caution . They 're dead . It hurts . Stop . Why , why , why , why ? It hurts. lt hurts. lt hurts ... - Max ? - lt hurts. lt hurts . Stop it , it hurts. lt hurts . Stop it , it hurts ... - lt 's all right . - Stop it , it hurts ... No . No , it 's me . They 're coming for me . Now I know that 's ... that 's why they 're coming for ... me . - lt hurts ... - Keep ' em out . Alpha team , secure the roof . Hold it right there ! Put your hands up and come with us ! Give me a hand now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Quadrant 4 , move in ! Alpha team ready on the roof . Roger , Alpha . Delta team , report . Delta team in position , sir . What are you doing ? You have a very sick man in there . We 're not in the hospital now , Dr Scully . Omega team report . - Omega team in position . - He 's a delusional schizophrenic . Keep her clear . Sir , this is Alpha team leader. I 'm picking up three forms inside the structure . Did you say three forms ? That 's affirmative . Two are proximate . The third , approaching from 40 metres . All teams , prepare for go in 30 seconds . Come on ! Come on , Max . Come on , stop . Why ... I 'm here to help you . - l 'm scared . - l know . - Don 't let ' em take me . - l won 't let ' em take you . Come on , Max . Come with me . No ! Max ! Sir , this is Alpha team leader . Except for our men , I 'm only picking up one figure inside . I do not copy that . We indicate only one figure inside the building . - What ? - Blow the door ! Take him ! Where is he ? He 's gone . They got to him first . They beat us , Colonel . Arrest him . And keep looking ! Agent Scully , to the best of your knowledge , was Agent Mulder ever assigned to investigate matters related to the evacuation of Townsend , Wisconsin ? No , sir . At any time were you aware of his submitting a form 302 , requesting said assignment or travel expenses ? No , sir . While in Wisconsin , did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus , registered to the State Car Rental Agency ? Yes , sir . Thank you , Agent Scully . - Sir , request permission to make a statement . - Request denied . Sir , it 's unfair to judge Mulder by the same criteria ... You 're dismissed , Agent Scully . - But , sir ... - That will be all ! D 'you hear that noise , Scully ? Hammer and nails . They 're building a gallows in the town square . Don 't worry . It was only a matter of time . I 'm surprised I lasted this long . Good luck . I 'll break a leg . .. as well as insubordination and misconduct . How do you respond to these allegations , Agent Mulder ? Over a dozen men lost their lives , and you want me to respond to issues of protocol ? - You failed to obtain proper authorisation . - Because I knew it wouldn 't be forthcoming . - And violated a Federal Quarantine Area , ... - A cover-up was under way ! exposing yourself and possibly others to toxic contamination . Toxic contamination ! We back in that ? You read my report . Explain Fenig 's disappearance . - Your report is not the subject of this inquiry . - l have further evidence ! X-rays of Mr Fenig when institutionalised show an object lodged in his cerebellum . That is irrelevant , Agent Mulder . The man was abducted . We all know it . Everybody here knows it ! Colonel Henderson 's written testimony states that Fenig 's body was found two hours later in a cargo container . Then what can I say ? How can I disprove lies that are stamped with an official seal ? That will be all , Mr Mulder . You can deny all the things I have seen , all the things I have discovered , but not for much longer . Cos too many others know what 's happening out there . And no one , no government agency has jurisdiction over the truth . Why did you countermand our decision ? Mulder 's conduct was in clear violation , not only of Bureau procedures , but of federal law . Yes . I don 't understand . The committee 's case was airtight . You ruined our last chance to get rid of him . I appreciate your frustration , but you and I both know that Mulder 's work - his singular passion - poses a most unique dilemma . But his occasional insubordination is , in the end , far less dangerous . With respect , sir , less dangerous than what ? Than having him expose to the wrong people what he knows . What he thinks he knows . Always keep your friends close , Mr McGrath . But keep your enemies closer . Subtitles by : syafiQ a.k.a basikalbaru I made this ! english

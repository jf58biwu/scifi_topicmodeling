 Well , there it is . It 's OCP . They screwed him up . He must be going out of his mind . It 's not as if he can just say no . They put all this nonsense into his brain . He has to obey . Take them out , all of them ! Can 't be done , not with this equipment . Are you saying there 's no way ? I can 't believe that . Sure , there are ways . You can pull his cranial circuits . Which would shut down his life-support . You could run a few thousand volts through him . Probably kill him . I 'll get some help ! - Get him inside ! - Come on , move it ! - Come on ! - Don 't touch him , he 's hot ! Use your jackets . Why 'd he do that ? Fried himself to get rid of OCP 's crazy commands . - Nice and easy . - He weighs a ton . Out of the way ! Move out ! - Think he 's alive ? - I don 't know . He 's pretty hot . Put me down . All right . Come on , stand him up . Are we cops ? What 's bugging you , Murph ? Cain . Cain 's bugging me . We have only just begun , my flock . Soon we will expand from city to city . The rich and poor alike will know a paradise for every moment of their lives . This is a Nuke for every mood . We 'll offer the opportunity to control every aspect of their emotional lives . Here with the white noise and black thunder and the red ramrod and the blue velvet . Frank . The blue velvet . I think it 's ready , sir . Thank you , Frank . Frank . The Benzedrine 's got my teeth wiggling . Cut it with scopolamine . - Five mils per . - Yes , sir . Made in America . Yeah . We 're gonna make that mean something again . - Hey ! Cops ! - What ? Cops ! And they ain 't carrying no picket signs ! They 're going to kick somebody 's ass ! Give me your hand , goddamn it ! Christ ! Fuck . Fuck ! Get out ! Bomb ! Get down ! You son of a bitch ! Five hundred million in cash . Nuke money seized by police . But State Attorney Sphincter won 't let the bankrupt city government touch it . Coming up next , threats from the police union and cheers from the public as Metro-North cops go back to work and apprehend the Nuke lord , Cain who may not live to stand trial . They say 20 seconds in the California sunshine is too much these days ever since we lost the ozone layer . But that was before Sunblock 5000 . Just apply a pint to your body and you 're good for hours . See you by the pool . Sunblock 5000 . Protection for the new age . Subject is violently antisocial given to delusions of godhood . And he 's hopelessly addicted to narcotics . Which offers us a simple and infallible method of insuring his obedience . You 're perfect . I must have you . What are you talking about ? It 's like you don 't even care ! - Just do what I say , Angie ! - He 'd want us to come for him ! Forget about it ! It 's not gonna happen ! I 'm through arguing with you ! I 'm not asking permission ! Cain is in the hospital , and we 're getting him . You 've really thought this out , haven 't you ? What about the cops ? We 've got guns ! - Damn it , Hob , Cain needs us ! - Fuck Cain ! - He 'd kill you if he heard you . - He 's not gonna kill anybody ! - Shit , he 's probably dead already . - You just shut the hell up ! You mouth off like that again , and it 's no more Nuke for you , bitch . Damn it , Hob , you know that 's not fair . Now , come on . - It 's been a bad time . - Sure has . You 're really hurting . Yeah , so I 'm hurting . You 're gonna get the shakes soon , Angie . You got it bad . You little bastard . You just do what I tell you from now on , Angie . Start the motor and drive . He 'll kill you . He 'll kill us both . Fuck him . Oh , you 're a mess . I got good news for you . You 're going to have a chance for immortality . As long as nothing happens to that lovely brain . Dr. Weltman ? It 's Faxx . I 'm afraid we lost our patient . Yeah , he just expired . Contact the organ harvest team . We 've got six minutes before the brain 's useless . Night . Come on . Let 's move it . We 've only got five minutes . Lock it up . Move the screen in closer . I can 't read it . - How 'd we get this one ? - Well , Faxx found him . He volunteered . Volunteered ? Big-hearted guy . Yeah , it 's not the heart we 're after , though . Speaking of hearts , how 's Ilene ? Christ , does everybody know ? All right , hold your breath . Showtime . It 's nice and clean in here . There 's no damage . Here we go . Easy . We got it . Here it comes . - Thing of beauty . - Excellent . I don 't know about the rest of you , but I 'm hungry . Thank you ! Yes ! Spider Baby Stalirski ! He 's come out for Detroit , and now you come out for him . The lines are open , waiting for your pledge . If you want an honest government that works for you I 'm asking you to dig deep into your pockets . I 'm asking you to give whatever you can spare ! Where does that put us ? Hi . Yes , ma 'am . Hello ! This is Mayor Kuzak ! Could you turn down your set , please ? Your Honor I have some very good news for you . I think the city is saved . Now you listen very carefully . It 's no bluff . Someone 's shown up to bail the city out . - A rival corporation . - The mayor isn 't saying . And whoever it is is taking great pains to keep their identity secret . They 're paying in cash and they 're not moving the money through the banks . Thank you , councilman . That will be all . You know , once you guys take over ... Your services to OCP will be rewarded . If the city can pay , we 'll be humiliated . It 's worse than that . We 've shifted 80 percent of our resources to the urban pacification plan . If we can 't foreclose , public confidence in OCP will plummet , so will our stock . Sir ? If I may ? There 's another option . We certainly have the surveillance capabilities to follow the mayor . It all depends how far we 're willing to go . If anything went wrong ... As I said , sir it all depends how far we 're willing to go . We have no legal recourse . There must be no witnesses . You 've gone too far ! Give me ... Your blood pressure . Get me fired if you want to . You 're not bringing illegal drugs to my lab ! I 'll do worse than get you fired . Now leave me alone ! Such terrible pain . You don 't remember me . But you do remember this , don 't you ? And we have it . All the Nuke you 'll ever need . Not so fast . I need you to do something for me first . Then the pain stops . Good boy . I don 't like this . I think we 'd better get out of here while we can . I know what I 'm doing . If you have any cash , put it in your shorts . That 's just plain rude . I wonder if any of you could help me . I 'm looking for a Mr. Hob . So how much you need ? Money , I mean . Well , our current debt to OCP is ... $ 37,480,911 dollars . Guess you 're in some pretty deep shit . We need all the help we can get , young man . Tell you what . Put me down for 50 , just to make sure . - 50 cents , 50 dollars . That 's cute . - Don 't be a queer . Fifty million . This is bullshit . Let 's get out of here . Good God . Gentlemen ? Well , will 50 do it ? Oh , yes . That 'll do it . - Don 't you guys think that 'll do it ? - Yeah . Fifty mil . That will do it . - That 'll do it . - These people are criminals ! Why do you have to label people ? - I hate labels ! - You shut up . We cannot capitulate in the war on crime . I 'd be voted out of office . I don 't think anyone wants that . War on crime is fine with us . It 's business we 're talking about here . Do you have any idea how many people we employ ? No . I never thought about it like that . Sharp kid . So your war on crime you want to win it or what ? We 're the only chance you have . Listen to him . He 's got it all worked out . Why do people do crimes ? - Why ? Drugs . People do drugs . - Because they want drugs . The kind that cost too much . Nuke gives high quality at a cheap price . If you get off our backs , we 'll make it cheaper . And safer . We don 't shove our shit down anybody 's throat . And we don 't advertise it like they do with cigarettes or booze . So leave us alone and anybody who wants it gets it . So no more crimes . You get to be the mayor who cleaned up Detroit . He 's got a point . Don 't you think he 's got a point ? Yeah , he 's got a point . What the hell is that ? Get out ! Marv , are ... ? Cain . Oh , wow . You look great . It 'll take some getting used to but it 'll be great , Cain . Lie still . - I 'm cold . - You are going into shock . I will call for a medical emergency unit . Wait . No . Don 't leave me . I won 't leave you . Who did this ? It was big . Bigger than you . It was Cain . I 'm gonna die . You know what that 's like , don 't you ? It really sucks . Yes . Thirteen dead in what appears to be a Nuke money massacre . Among the victims , two city councilmen . Was the city trying to strike a deal with the drug lords ? No comment ! I said , I have no comment ! No comments on these allegations . These were men who served this city tirelessly . However , I make a promise to the people of Detroit City that no effort will be spared to investigate this thoroughly ! But , Mr. Mayor , what about ... ? I 'm sorry . No more questions . Our own Mayor Kuzak . Now let 's go live to Jess . And here it is , the Civic Centrum , OCP 's 100-story gift to the Motor City . While debate continues over OCP 's hostile takeover there 's no denying the mood down here is festive . Citizens interviewed on the scene expressed excitement and hope that OCP will make good on its promise of a better life in Detroit . - Press ! - Sorry , folks , media only . TV and press only . You 'll have to step back . There he is ! Can OCP bring industry back to Detroit ? Does OCP own the city ? Will you hold elections ? - Do we become OCP employees ? - Why not go to City Hall ? Just a minute . I 'll answer that , young lady . City Hall is the decaying symbol of mismanagement and corruption . You get that ? This magnificent structure will be the seat of leadership for the new Detroit . And what better place for a clean , fresh start ? And so , people of the press city officials in a few minutes Omni Consumer Products and the troubled city of Detroit will join in a bold new venture . Now I 'd like to explain just what this will mean . Sometimes we just have to start over from scratch to make things right . And that 's exactly what we 're going to do . We 're going to build a brand-new city where Detroit now stands . An example to the world . My friends welcome to our city as it should be . And as it will be , in the hands of responsible private enterprise . And a special welcome to Mayor Kuzak and the outgoing administration . We 're not going anywhere . Your Honor . You 'll have to tear down a lot of houses to make that . I mean , take away their homes ! We 're going to raise towers of glass and steel . Every citizen will have a living unit , safe , secure , and clean . Now , please take your seat . Won 't be much room for neighborhoods . Not like the kind we all grew up in . Today neighborhoods are places where bad things happen . Don 't be nostalgic . What about democracy ? Nobody elected you . Anyone can buy OCP stock and own a piece of our city . What could be more democratic than that ? There 's a lot of people in this town that can 't afford to buy your stock ! And they won 't let you get away with this . You haven 't been following the polls . Sit down . Sit down , mayor . About a year ago we gave this city Robocop . I think he 's worked out pretty well . But things have become rougher out there . And now we need a law enforcement unit able to meet the enemy on his own ground and carrying enough firepower to get the job done . Ladies and gentlemen with great pleasure I give you Robocop 2 . - Those bastards are maniacs ! - What 's the matter ? I can 't believe it . It was them ! They sent it ! Sent what ? Nothing . There going to be a big call for this unit . And we 'll make him right here in Detroit . That means jobs we can all be proud of . And make " Made in America " mean something again . This single container holds enough Nuke to addict a city block . A hundred of these are produced every day and sent to sweatshops where urban slaves prepare this poison for our friends , our loved ones , our children . Now , I say it 's high time we put an end to this plague . Robocop 2 will seek out every laboratory every dealer , and rid our city of Nuke . Yes . Things will be a lot quieter with this boy around . - What 's wrong with him ? - It 's nothing . - Nothing at all . - Turn him off . I can 't . Cain ! Let 's step outside . You ! Get out of here ! You 're obsolete ! That thing is a killer ! - It 's not even armed ! It 's harmless ! - It 's a killer , and I saw it ! - Take her out of here ! Now ! - Let me go ! Behave yourselves ! - What 's the deal here ? - Christ knows . Sounds like a war in there . You 're coming with me , Cain . There he is ! - All right , get back ! - Are you jealous of the replacement ? This could look bad for OCP , Johnson . Scramble the best spin team we have . Ammo ! Ammo ! Get down ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire , damn it ! Let 's get him out of here . Watch his neck . He 's hurt bad . Easy . Shit ! I gotta get back . Move it back ! Move it back ! Let 's give him what he wants . Goodbye . It 's serious trouble . So many dead and wounded . There won 't be trouble from the dead . They 'll have relatives . They always do . - It 'll be a feeding frenzy . - It 's only money . - What about criminal proceedings ? - Well we 're looking at major indictments , sir . Prison terms . - What about me ? - You know we 'll do whatever we can . - That 's not good enough . - Sir ? What if this was the work of one individual ? A person who had her own agenda , wasn 't in sync with the goals of our company ? Well , that usually works . A woman who was not a team player . Who violated our trust . Easy , easy . Well we 'd need some evidence to support that . Sir , whether it exists or not , I know I can find it . She did choose the brain , sir . - Good thinking . - Sir . Thank God you 're all right . I was worried . I thought it was going to hurt you . It 's over . It 's all over . I failed you . Don 't be hard on yourself . Everything 's going to be all right . Johnson , that business we were talking about . Get right on it . Yes , sir . Just look at what they 've done . They are criminals . OCP won 't own this city for long . And I 'll see to that . I 'll take it to the streets and the people . What has it come to ? Businessmen can buy our rights like stock ? You don 't realize what we 're losing ! - Right here , sir ! - Give us a statement ! Dozens are dead . Is this your idea of a better life ? - Was this an experiment of some kind ? - He was crazy . How did it happen ? - Did you build it to take control ? - How do you account for this disaster ? Will OCP make reparations to the victims ? That son of a bitch is getting away with it . We can 't even touch him . Patience , Lewis . We 're only human .

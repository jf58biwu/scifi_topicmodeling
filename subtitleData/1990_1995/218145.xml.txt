 Recognize the face , Bishop Martin ? All right . Who are you , cowboy ? That 's a good question . I 've kind of been wonderin that myself . The Tube . Sooner or later , everything disappears . All that 's left are the memories . They 're the only thing in the world that means anything . I have to find the owner of those memories ... find a way into his heart ... and love him . Don 't worry . I 've got my phone . - You sure you 'll be okay ? - Yes . Now go to work . - Mmm , come on . - You 're gonna be late . I 'm the man of the house . I 'm older . Go on . - Hey , what 's that ? - Hmm ? See ya . Hey . Sorry . How 's it going ? - Morning . - Hey , how are you ? If you say it 's good , then it 's good . So , you got plenty of rest last night ? Pretty wife like that , I doubt it . Pay no attention to him . He 's just jealous . Tell me which train is approaching the bridge . - 2890 , sir . - Okay , reduce its speed 10 % . Right . Tell all trains approaching Third Street Bridge to slow down . That area 's under major construction . The bridge is even unstable . All sections begin P.P.M. Sir , this is Sangho . Sector " C " is flooded . Thanks . Flood Team to mobilize . Your nose needs a flood team as well . All right ! Got to be pretty wild last night , huh ? Way to go ! I 'm proud of ya ! That 's all there is today . You telling me that 's all you can do , huh ? What do I look like , a charity ? Oh , you really piss ... I 'm gonna catch a lot of shit because of you . So let 's figure out another way out of this little dilemma , huh ? Is your hand broken ? No . It will be . I told them I 'd pay it all back . I just need a few more days , that 's all . Now , there goes one stupid bitch . There 's only one thing I hate worse than owing money . I 'll bet you don 't know what that is . It 's somebody calling me stupid . How ' bout I show you what stupid is , huh ? Get yourself some real food . Don 't blow it on beer . That bitch ! She took my fuckin ' wallet ! You idiots ! You can tell everything about a man ... by his shoulders ... his thoughts ... his life . His shoulders look ... so lonely ... so very lonely . May I have your attention , please ? The 6 : 15 train originally leaving on Track seven ... will now be departing on Track 14 . The bitch . Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? You are stupid , you know that ? You rob me and you think you can get away with it ? - You are so fucking dead ! - You should watch your back . Maybe you better be ... be ... be ... Get the hell out of my way ! Hey , relax , man . Move it ! Get out of my way ! we have a breach on Track 63 . Code two . I repeat , code two . Please continue with procedure . 6036 and 6042 , hold your positions . - 63 A.T.S. , stand by . - Stand by . 6036 E.M.R. , hold . Emergency stop . Oh ! Okay ! Let me go ! Oh , fuck me . - Were they killed ? - I don 't know ! You 're a psycho , you know that ? You 're the one who should be locked up , not me . God , I was almost killed back there ! What 's the matter with you ? Oh , you 're crazy . Hey , he wants to talk to you . If you 're wondering about a report ... I 'll fax it to you later . That guy 's totally crazy . It 's a good thing all cops aren 't like that , huh ? - At least you 're still alive . - Thanks to you . You may not realize this , Jay , because so many trains have stopped for you ... in the past ... it won 't always be like that . Someday there 'll be a train that can 't be stopped . What happens then ? It 's the end of the line . End of the line , my ass . Hey , butthole ! Come on ! Let me out of here ! You fuck . ! If it 's what the people want , then I will run for president . Did you say the Rhodes Team ? Never heard of it . Just another conspiracy theory . Are there any other questions ? We believe he stole it from the bishop , sir . Very well . Then kill him . To smoke it , you gotta light it . You took my bag . I might have had some little thing to do with it . I bet a buck that your heart 's probably as messy ... as that bag is . Oh , don 't be so serious . I 'll return it the way I found it . I 'm a detective . - Don 't play games . - I 'm not playing . If you ever need a light , I 'll do it for you . Police regulations ! Why don 't you just try lookin ' ' em up ? Tell me one thing ! You tell me , where does it say ... you 're supposed to jump on the tracks to chase a suspect ? I want you to tell me where it says ... you 're supposed to make a subject so scared that he pisses in his pants . Look , I understand chasing T. outside your jurisdiction . I know how bad you want him . He means everything to you . But you gotta do it the right way , Jay . When you lose a suspect , you should get your ass in here . But instead , you thought it 'd be better to go break someone 's nose ! Do you know who those guys are ? They 're Special Operations with police headquarters ! And they 're pissed ! Damn it ! You screwed up the whole thing . Because of you , my boss is chewing me a new asshole . Are you listening to me ? I 'm not putting my career on the line for you . I 've got too much at stake . Are you even listening to me ? You 've interfered with my work one too many times , Detective . Consider this a warning . And it 's the only warning you 're gonna get . - Then what ? - Then ... here 's a hint ! You 're still obsessing over that bastard ? Yeah . You 've got obsessions too . Your wife was the only one you 'd ever listen to . She knew how to get through to you . Sometimes you just gotta forget . You 're hopeless . Yea ! Bravo ! I won 't let her get close to me . You fool . Life is not that complicated . We need to get this guy right away . Priority one , okay ? I want every available man on the job . No one gets vacation time . Whoever makes this arrest is actually entitled to a nice little promotion , all right ? Next up , we 've got the mayor 's photo session on the subway to deal with . Now , headquarters is gonna take care of security ... so we just need one person to act as a shadow then . About half an hour . Who wants to go ? Detective Jay might . Anybody but him . Are you nuts ? If headquarters sees him , they 'll shit a brick . All right , all right , now everyone get to work . You all know your assignments , don 't you ? I made myself clear . Get goin ' ! Hold on a second , you . Come on . Get over here . I 'm warning you , Jay . You really gotta be careful . One more screwup and that 's gonna be it for you . Look , I know what you 're going through . All you gotta do is follow the rules . You 'll be okay . Don 't make an ass of yourself out there ! - You won 't forget ? - I won 't forget . I never forget . Come on , Jay . You know it 's classified . Direct from the chief . No one is allowed to look at that . I could get fired for this . Yeah , right there ! Move ' em in to the right ! All right , listen . There 's gonna be a shitload of people in here today . We need order in here , huh . - I have a question . - Oh , great . What is it , son ? I was thinking , since this mission is important ... shouldn 't we be carrying guns ? Rookie . I tell you what . You want a gun ? There 's one in your crotch . I have an idea . - I 'm all ears . - Sir , what if we had guns that only held blanks ? What 's that ? - It needs to go to the Chunwang maintenance yard . - Okay . Mr. Yun ? We 're gonna need to cut power for a bit . Okay , I 'll shut everything down except the front cars , but try to make it quick . I miss you . You be careful . Take the subway , okay ? It 's a lot cooler than the bus . We 'll make up the lost time later . What do you think ? Mm-hmm . I love you . Yeah , I do too . Hmm ? Are you saying " me too " is all I get ? Is it so embarrassing to say you love me ? - Young love , huh ? - We 'll give it about a year ... and then see if he 's acting that happy . Sir . The driver from 7103 . D3-7103 ready to pull out . Over . I know that T. is up to something . He has a target in mind . I want you to cross-check the victims from the last incident . Thank you . Forget about T. and just do your job . There 's 150,000 police officers out there . - One of them will catch him . - Can you spare a cigarette ? - I don 't need it . - If you don 't smoke ' em , they 're no good to you . Well , a man 's word isn 't much good either if he doesn 't keep it , right ? Yeah ? Oh , hi . This is Kay . Am I about done ? Why ? - Because I 'm busy . - We 'll say when it 's time to leave . - I think it 's time now . - Sit down ! Who are you ? Jay and Kay together . Lovely . Yeah ? Where are you ? Where are you , uh ... You 're getting off , next stop , you hear ? Tell the mayor your concerns . I 'd like to see more cultural events , things that families can enjoy together . Well , things will improve from now on . You can count on it . Oh , we 're going fast . Mm-hmm . We 'll get there a lot quicker this way . Shit ! Oh , shit ! Shit ! Get the fuck out of my way ! How ' bout we take a little walk , huh ? Someplace private ? So why do you want me to go anyway ? Why not that Sammi girl you met , huh ? - All right , I 'll ask her . - Go ahead . Fine . Fuck this ! Come on , you asshole . I 'll kick your ass ! Huh ? No , no ! What are you doing ? We have to slow down , or we 'll all die . Sir , 7103 's brake systems are all being switched to manual . All trains on 37 , this is an emergency . I repeat , this is a red alert . 7103 , reduce your speed . Do you copy ? Do you copy ? Come in . 7103 , you 're in danger of collision with the train ahead of you . You must slow down . Collision alert . ! 7103 , come in ! 7103 , come in . You must reduce your speed . You 're on a course for direct collision if you don 't stop . I control things from now on . Here 's your instructions . If you try and stop the train by cutting the main power ... you 'll see exactly what kind of destruction one ton of explosives is capable of . Call the authorities . Tell them that T. is in charge here . Nobody panic . Take your time . There 's no need to rush . Everything 's gonna be fine . Yes , indeedy . Huh ? Oh , fuck ! I don 't believe it ! We 're pinpointing the positions of all the trains . Kwon ? - Stay here . - I can 't . I have to get something I left there . It 's dangerous , got it ? Wait . All right then , I will , if you stay here with me . I told you , it 's dangerous . Meaning it 's dangerous for the both of us . So I can 't let you go alone . Get the track brakes ready . Kay , are you listening to me ? I give you exactly two minutes ... to return to me what was stolen . After that , a bag will explode in one of the cars . If you want everybody to live ... I would suggest you hurry . The clock is ticking . One minute , 40 seconds . No , wait ! Kay , don 't go ! Don 't go ! Kay ! I like it when you call me Kay . That 's the first time you said it . Don 't worry about it . I 'll see ya . Kay , come back ! Thirty seconds . Twenty seconds . Sorry , Kay . Time 's up . Is everybody okay ? Yeah ? Pleasure to speak with you , Jay . You should know your little girlfriend here has made things more difficult just recently . I want you to watch me kill her ... the way you killed my woman . I 'm the one you really want . Just let her go . Pretty good idea , the subway . It 's the perfect place for you and me to end this . All right then ... whenever you 're ready . I 'll wait right here . You stop me . Or is it all talk ? Up to you . You can 't stop it from here ? Well , sir , all the remote controls were switched from inside the train , I 'm afraid . The only way to stop it would be in an area with an external braking system . Sir , it 's 7103 . I wanna know who 's in charge over there . This is the chief of police . I 'm the one in charge . Don 't talk . Just listen . In 30 minutes , I want the press to be present . Second , I want the last prime minister ... Song Il-Kwon , to be there as well . Don 't try and be heroes and go and do anything stupid , understand ? That 's 30 minutes , starting right now . You better get busy . Obnoxious . I want the SWAT team . - This is Control . Come in . - This is Detective Jay speaking . That 's Jay . I should have known . This is the lieutenant . Where are you right now ? - Rear control room . - Don 't do anything stupid , you hear me , Jay ? A SWAT team is ready to move in . Listen to me now . You get close to T. using any means you can . Try to tell us everything that 's goin ' on . And lastly , do not fuck this up ! You 're the reason we lost T. the last time , aren 't you ? Your orders are to sit tight and wait for further instructions . Hey , this is weird . But do you think it 'll get worse than this ? Don 't be stupid , man . So , you think we 'll make it ? It 's about 70-30 . - In our favor ? - Against us . Oh , shit . Clear Track 37 first . Can the trains in front keep their distance ? Yeah , for about eight minutes . All right . A.T.S. station to remote . Calculate possible A.T.S. position for 7103 . Power Team , Track Team , all stand by . Close tracks in all directions . Oh , fuck . Oh , shit ! Shit , man . Hey , you fucker , let me out of here ! I don 't wanna die here on this train . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold on . Hey ! Yeah ? Well , bite me ! Dickhead ! Come on . Shit . Ow ! Cramp . Shit , shit , shit , shit , shit , shit , shit ! It 's okay . A picture is worth a thousand words . I want you to record every single thing that happens here . There 's a man who must pay a steep price for this . Yes , sir . What 's wrong with you ? You think you 'd survive if you jump ? You 're an idiot ! It would never work ! Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . The clock 's ticking . What 's it gonna be ? Did you do as I demanded ? Are the old man and the press there ? They 're on their way here . We need more time , that 's all . I see . What 's going on in there ? What is it ? What are you doing ? I am the mayor ! Don 't do this . ! To stop more of your people from being murdered ... it 's simple , really . I want to talk to Prime Minister Song . You have 30 more minutes . - Is the antiterrorism unit in place ? - Yes , sir . Tell them to stand by . Make sure everyone else is ready . - Sir , I 've been briefed on the operation , but , uh ... - All right , what ? It 's the train , I think you should reconsider where you stop it . Enough . Stop . You said that you wouldn 't . I guess you don 't recall that . Okay , that 's it . Aw , but this is an emergency . Come on . Give me a break , just this once . Okay ? But a man 's word isn 't much good , if he doesn 't keep it . All right , promise me this . You 'll never smoke , not unless I light it for you . Is it a deal ? Okay ? I don 't need a light . - It 's the best location for the operation . - Not for the passengers , sir . - There 'll be some collateral damage . - Yes , sir ... but there 's better ways to minimize that damage . But you saw what that maniac did ! If you stop that train in a tunnel as dark as that one ... there 'll be panic and chaos . That train holds nearly a thousand passengers . That location is a critical point . It 's where the tracks cross each other . So besides a massive gun battle ... there 's one more thing to consider ... 20,000 volts of electricity . Are you sure that 's what you want ? - I can stop it if you give me the time . - Time ? The time 's gone . This will be a bloodbath , I 'm afraid . Just reconsider the options . Kwon , do what he says ! All right , Jay . We 're getting ready to move in . In a few minutes , the train is gonna stop inside a tunnel . It 's imperative that the passengers don 't get off . Do you understand ? No matter what they hear . They must stay on the train . - A.T.S. station remote ready ? - Yes , sir . - Acceleration ? - Passing 120 kilometers . Good . A.T.S. , now stand by . " C " Squad , cover left . Unit Nine , take the right flank . - One kilometer . - Wait for the command . Distance ? 800 , 700 , 600 . 500 . Nearing checkpoint . - 300 . - Do it ! Let 's get out of here ! No ! Wait ! Don 't get off the train ! Stop ! Don 't get off the train ! Wait ! Jump ! Jump ! Watch out ! Sir , they 've begun to switch to the opposite track . - A.T.S. station to manual . Don 't let them go . - Right . - Impossible . - Interlock , cut the high voltage . But it won 't work , sir . The train 's going the wrong way . 7512 , 7822 , divert to alternate tracks ! 7345 , 7238 ... evacuation to Track 49 complete ! 7423 can 't switch to Track 56 . Sir , there 's not enough room for them to make it . They 're on a direct path . They 're gonna collide ! - Tell them they should increase their speed . - Excuse me ? Just do what I said and do it now . Hakdong Station 's emergency track is just ahead . - Right . - If he can get there first , they 'll bypass each other . As soon as 7423 enters the track ... you 'll have to close it immediately . Then 7103 will slip by untouched . We have no other choice , men . As long as 7423 gets there first , it 'll work . Timing ! Simply do your jobs like you were trained . Their only hope is for each of you to do your jobs today . 7423 , increase your speed . You think you 're smart enough to win this ? Is that what you think , huh ? The only thing that I think is that you 're a piece of shit ! Oh , yeah ? Well , this piece of shit is about to kill you ! - Come on ! Go faster ! - Stop yelling at me . I 'm trying ! I 'm trying ! Say good night . Clamp it ! Song , can you hear me ? You didn 't get me . Are you disappointed ? Did you really think the killer you developed ... would die so easily ? You recall the Rhodes Team ? It now appears you have become my objective . And I 'm not about to miss . I have a friend in the Justice Department ... that told me about the Rhodes Team . It carried out the covert government assignments . The International Civil Rights Committee protested the existence of the Team ... so Assemblyman Song axed it and had nearly all the agents killed . Check this out . They even killed their families to hush this whole thing up . This guy is brutal . I 'm telling you , if word about this gets out ... he 's finished . All right , what is it ? - Prime Minister . - Yes ? We don 't have much time . Time . My time . While I was out there committing murders for the government ... you had my dear wife slaughtered . The entire Rhodes Team . And now today ... you simply ignore my warning . Fine . You 'll switch the train to Track 72 at the next intersection . Listen , if that train gets on Track 72 ... it 'll head for the Third Street Bridge . I don 't know if you know any of this , but ... that area is under major construction . Your acceleration will cause that bridge to collapse . How interesting . There 's only one thing that can save the passengers . I 'll trade the old man 's life ... in exchange for all the lives of the people on this train . You always say how much you love the people of this country . Now you have a chance to show it . Just sacrifice your own life . I don 't believe it . You 're not pulling my leg , are you ? You 're really alive ? Great . Yeah . I always said that if there was anyone ... that could come back from the dead , it 'd be you . - My boy Jay did it ! It 's like ... - Where 's the train right now ? Right . T. said switch to Track 72 . So it 's on an emergency line . There 's trouble . That 's the Third Street Bridge , which is under construction right now . Everybody there is in danger , Jay ! If the train makes it to that bridge , it 'll collapse . The whole thing will go ! And then ... they 're all gonna die . Let me talk to Mr. Kwon . I 'm gonna try , Jay . Okay . The subway system was meant to be used ... as a bomb shelter , as well , in case of war . The tracks are like arteries , with shafts connecting them . One kilometer ahead of you is E753 . If you follow that passageway , you 'll come to the end of Track 72 . I want to know exactly how one man can beat a whole police force ! He has made the police look like complete idiots . - Police idiots ? - You ! And you ! - Huh ! - And you ! All of you ! - Assholes . - Idiots ! According to emergency operating procedures ... all outsiders and communication with the outside ... is hereby temporarily suspended . Please explain this to me . I 'm just following my orders . No , that 's too far . How about , uh , over here then ? No , no . The power 's already at maximum . Well , what about this way to Track 59 ? That 'll only work after it passes the depot . Is there no way the train will make it over the bridge ? They 're going about 140 kilometers per hour . Now , at that speed , it 's like the force of 10 trains . - Even a regular train would ... - Break up . There 's gotta be a way . I know there is . Make it happen . - The weight ? - Yes , the weight . Like the number of cars there are ... what if we reduce them ? That 's it . Okay . Huh ? Hey , you asshole ! Where the hell have you been ? Innocent people are dying on this train . How can you let that bastard run around ? What the fuck 's the matter with you ? Okay . There 's three power cables that are black . First , delete the connector on the right . Hey , listen to me . You 're on overtime . You 'd better hurry . Use your foot to get leverage so you can ... Excuse me . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , watch out ! Give me your hand ! Here ! Over here ! Hey , hey ! Here ! Here ! It 's good to see daylight ! Just calm down . Shh ! Shh ! - Are they gonna let us off ? - Hold my hand . Stop this . Do it right now . Did you hear me ? Go sit down . We 've been through enough . We 're not gonna take it anymore ! Come on ! Just a little further ! That goes for me . - I 'm not about to let you do this . - Yeah , me too . You can 't shoot all of us . You asshole ! Just grab his hand , damn it ! I see . All heroes . You should be proud . Now , before you begin to attack me ... decide which will be the first of you to die . You almost got it . You almost got it . Just a little further . Come on ! Come on ! Get him ! Get him ! Get him ! Pull ! We gotcha ! We gotcha ! Pull ! Pull him in ! Who wants to be the first martyr ? You ? Or you ? Any of you ? You have to pull the lever on the connecting mount . - Or you ? - Let us go . Yes ! How about that ! Oh , boy ! Come on ! Jump ! You can make it ! Come on ! - Come on ! - I got work to do . I 've got a girl over there too . - Aw , geez ! - All right ! Huh ? Hey ! I 'm supposed to be over there with you guys . You assholes ! I shouldn 't be ... Go ahead then . It 'll be the end of you too . My , you 're either resilient ... or an idiot . It 's just you and me . The emergency brakes can only be operated in the train . We have Jay . Bet you think my boy 's a bit over his head , don 't you ? Huh ? Bullshit . Stop it ! - Watch it ! - Careful ! Look out ! You think this is it ? It 's far from over . Oh ! - I can 't believe it ! - Thank you ! Oh ! - We 're saved ! - Kay , wake up . Kay ! Kay ! Kay . Kay . Come on . Wake up . Wake up . Can you hear me ? Huh ? This can 't end like this . Wake up . Wake up . You can do it . Huh ? Why aren 't we stopping ? What exactly is going on here ? - Is there a problem ? - The brakes have an alternate control . - We need you to locate it . - It 's over there . - There . - Now open it and pull it . [ Man Shouting , Indistinct ] Pull it again ! Isn 't there any way to stop this ? Come on ! Do it ! Come on ! Do it ! There are two emergency brakes on there ... oil and steam-pressurized . I think they 're both gone . - It 's not working ! - Keep trying ! Keep trying ! Come on ! All right . We begin again then . I want to break down every bolt of that train . Get a duplicate train ready at the depot . Call every department . Have them go over it inch by inch . Find an answer , people . You fucking cop ! Why don 't you do something to stop this train , huh ? Look at all those innocent people over there ! Well , you 're not one of them , huh ? Pussy dipshit . Sir . We have confirmed there are 27 passengers on board at present . And , uh ... So you haven 't been hurt ? I 'm okay . Can you hear that ? Yeah . I heard it . Don 't worry about it . I 'll save you , okay ? - I love you , honey . - You 're not too embarrassed to say it now ? I love you . We believe the microchip is still on the train , sir . Look , here on the plans , I see an access point . I think we could use that to our advantage . Kwon . You 'd better come . On its present course , that train will head directly ... for the nuclear power plant . This could prove disastrous . We 're no longer only concerned with the safety of the passengers . Remember that gas explosion last year ? Believe me , gentlemen , if 7103 hits that power plant ... just like T. intends it to ... it would cause a massive explosion 10 times that . So , you see the problem ? What else can we do ? I heard the story . A man was trapped under a building ... that had just collapsed on top of him . He tried and tried to escape for hours . Then he finally gave up after realizing there was no hope of getting out . Then suddenly ... he started to think about candy and the woman he sometimes shared it with . He survived just by thinking how sweet it was . That 's right . We all have memories we can 't forget . Life 's not ... that complicated , you know . I hope it 's a good memory . One sweet memory is enough . So you want to send these people to their demise . In order to prevent a bigger tragedy . - You 're not even giving those people an option ? - There are no options ! We have to look at the bigger picture here . The important thing is that they 're alive right now ... and sitting on that train waiting to be rescued ! If you have an alternative , I 'm listening . One question , if I might ask . What 's so important to make you kill a bunch of people like that ? Is there somebody on that train ? Is that what it is ? Somebody that you want to see dead ? I thought we 're sacrificing these people to stop a bigger calamity . Could it be your personal calamity ? - Answer me then ! - Kwon ! I won 't do it . I just can 't do it . I don 't care whatever your reason is . I won 't be part of it . All right , Kwon . That 'll be all for today then . I 'm in charge of things around here now , so let 's get to work . I want a report on the train 's position . Approximately three kilometers from Track 28 . Okay . Switch over to Track 55 on my command . Sir , wait . - It 's under construction over there . - I know that . We must sacrifiice them to prevent an even bigger tragedy . How much further to the transfer point ? Which man is in charge of the track transfer ? Answer me ! I 'm not gonna be asking again . It 's me , sir . I 'll make the move when you tell me . I know my orders . I 'll be prepared . All personnel , stand ready . All right . Transfer , stand by . Stand by . I will now begin the countdown . Five ... four ... three ... two ... - God , please forgive us . - one . This is wrong , you know ? - Switch it ! - Switching . But in case ... But in case something goes wrong ... I want you to live longer than I do . Hey , Hangmo . You copy ? Hangmo ? We 're completely out of options now . It 's our only chance . Get Detective Jay . All right . I 'll do it . We can 't stop the train by cutting the main power ... because of the explosives in the control room . But we can disconnect the first car ... and send it ahead on its own ... and then stop the second car by cutting the power . - What about the bomb ? - The first car will continue to move ... separating from the second car . But the problem is someone has to stay behind ... to hold the electric condenser so the bomb won 't detect it when we cut the power . And when the condenser runs out of power ... It detonates . Pow . Come on ! Move along ! Make it quick ! - Are they gonna stop it ? What 's going on ? - How the fuck should I know ? Get outta the way ! Fuck ! My lighter 's gone . You , uh , perhaps got a light ? Jay ! Are you listening ? What the hell is wrong with you ? You think you 're some kind of hero . Is that what it is ? Why do you have to do this anyway ? Why do you have to go and get yourself killed ? Aw , Jay , I told you it 'd go down like this . You 're a piece of work , you know that ? You listen . This is a direct order from your superior officer . You are not allowed to blow up ! Come on , man . You 're not thinkin ' straight ! Look , get everyone together and pick someone . Draw straws . Rock , paper , scissors . I don 't care . Are you there ? Are you listening to me , Jay ? Are you listening ? Put that radio down . That boy in there is gonna die ... and you just stand there actin ' like some hotshot bigwig . Maybe you should go on that train instead ! Being as how you 're so important . Bullshit ! You 're just a puppet ! That 's all ! Excuse me , but you 're totally out of line . Oh , yeah ? You 're sendin ' them all to die ... just so you can save your own ass . Or else that fat ass of the prime minister , right ? Yeah , I know the whole story . You 're trying to cover it up ! This whole thing 's a fuckin ' lie ! My boy 's gonna die for a lie ! - Well , here ! - Excuse me , sir . We know what 's happening here today . We still might be able to save the passengers . And also , sir , Chief Kwon needs to be here to help us . Chief Kwon . We have 12 kilometers to impact . Standing by . Right . Check the safe distance from the point of making the cut . All stations stand by . I won 't let you . You 've made it this far . It 's not fair . Let someone else do it . - Look , Kay ... - Don 't say my name ! You have to stay alive ! I can 't let you go . I just found you . Please ! Don 't go ! Don 't go ! Don 't go ! Please ! Don 't go ! Don 't do this ! Someone do something ! Don 't go ! Don 't do this ! They 're separating . Ready to cut power . Yeah . Cut all circuits . Yes , sir . Didn 't I tell you , Jay ? Eventually ... you would come across a train that can 't be stopped . They 're coming out ! - There they are ! - Thank you ! Please tell us how it feels to be safe . - What was it like down there ? - Yes ! - We 're just thankful to be alive . - All right ! Who 's the man ? Let me go ! Hey ! Oh ! I knew I had to stay strong . I had to because of this incriminating memory chip . I put my life on the line to protect this ... because I knew it would reveal the corruption of those in power . In the end , everything fades . All that 's left are the memories . I 'll always see his faint smile . Life 's not that complicated , you know . One sweet memory is enough .

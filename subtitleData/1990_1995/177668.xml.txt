Oh , my God ! [ crowd screams and shouts ] - [ low rumbling ] - [ man ] Oh , dear ! We came all the way from California to be in another earthquake ? Oh , dear ! Oh , my ! [ male announcer ] Now a word from His Royal Highness Prince Charles . First and foremost , I would like to summarily dispel the ugly rumor that I have in any way become involved with Roseanne Barr , and that ... [ woman ] Run for it , Charlie . It 's a monster ! [ roars ] [ high-pitched flute ] [ roars ] Oh , crumbs ! [ Sue ] Reed , we 'll be late for the dance . Hmm ? Oh , that 's wonderful , sweetheart . Ben and Alicia are waiting and Johnny will be here with Melinda any second . [ elastic stretching ] Reed ! Sorry . It 's just that I 've been triangulating the source of those strange landmark sinkings . And if I 'm right , New York City could be the next target . [ Alicia ] Oh , Ben , you 're so light on your feet . [ chuckles ] Yeah , just call me twinkle toes . Hey , hoofin ' is thirsty work . You like something cold to drink ? That 'd be lovely . [ banging and rattling ] Here , choose your beverage , baby . Oh , Ben , you 're so gallant . Good evening , Ben , Alicia , I understand Johnny is bringing Melinda . - [ Alicia ] Yes , so I hear . - [ Reed ] That 's nice . Who is she ? - Our landlady 's niece . - Your putting me on . [ Ben ] Just because Miss Forbes is a pill don 't mean the kid 's a lemon . Besides , the little hotfoot 's crazy about her . Let me put a chill on that , Alicia . Warm soda tastes like garbage . Just the sort of tasteless vulgarity I 'd expect from you , Mr. Grimm . Quick , tell Dorothy and Toto to hide . It 's the Wicked Witch of the West . When Melinda told me who her escort was to be , I didn 't know whether to accompany her as a chaperone or throw up . - You look like you did both . - Stay close to me , child . If you 're not alert , he 'll flame up and raise your temperature . [ traffic noise ] [ big band jazz ] [ Ben ] Hey , Forbesy , don 't be a wallflower . Come on , let 's cut us some carpet . Oh ! Oh ! Put me down ! People are staring ! Well , then let 's give them something to stare at . Good grief ! [ Ben ] Relax , babe , we 're a smash . Cool , huh ? I mean , the lights of the city stretched out all around , great music and ... and , and you in my arms . It 's very nice , in an unsophisticated way . Dancing on the Champs Elysées in Paris is much more romantic . Er , yeah , right , the Champs Alisa , that 's my favorite hang-out . And now , folks , a surprise treat . The Human Torch himself , Johnny Storm , performing his own song ! ¶ Uh , uh , uh , uh , uh ¶ Uh , uh , uh ¶ This is for you , Melinda Uh , uh , uh ¶ I hope you like it ¶ Uh , uh , uh , yeah ¶ Uh , uh , uh ¶ They oughta teach this in school ¶ It 's not always cool to be cool ¶ You tried to play me for a fool ¶ Like you see a girl who 's unique ¶ It 's a dream ' cause she 's sweet ¶ And she really seems to knock you off your feet ¶ You wanna say hey but you don 't You don 't ¶ Your mom says tell her how you feel , but you won 't ¶ ' Cause you 're just too cool to tell her truly ¶ That your feelings are getting unruly Don 't try to school me ¶ So she passes you by in the hallway ¶ You 're staring at the wall trying to play ¶ While I say , man , you 're cool ¶ Really cool , slick , just like ice ¶ But you didn 't realize You never get this chance twice ¶ So you 're busy playing cool now she 's gone ¶ Gone onto another while I sing my funky song ¶ I never passed up a chance I know this story seems long ¶ But when I know the time is right for me and you , I just ¶ Flame on Flame on ¶ And on , and on , and on Flame on , yeah ¶ Yeah , flame on And on , and on , and on , and on ¶ Flame on I just flame on ... [ Reed ] Keep calm , everyone . Don 't panic . Flame on ! Whhh ... What 's happening ? [ Reed ] We 're sinking into the center of the earth ! [ horns blaring ] [ whistling sound of falling ] [ gasps and shouts ] Wow , we 're miles beneath the surface of the earth , Sue . In some bizarre series of caverns . Yes , but how ? And why ? I don 't know , but it 's clearly tied to the disappearance of those other landmarks . The building seems to have stabilized . Everyone must maintain your composure and remain here while my colleagues and I address this predicament . He means hang loose , we 're working on it . Sheesh , can 't you ever talk plain English ? I want to go home , Aunt Lavinia . So do I. If you 'd gone out with Leland Armbruster as I wanted you to , we wouldn 't be in this ghastly pickle . But Leland Armbruster is a dork . Better a rich dork than an inflammable weirdo . Alicia , I 'm leaving you in charge . Try to keep them calm . [ band leader ] One , two , one , two , three , four ... ¶ Oh , Susanna , don 't you cry for me [ Reed ] The explanation to all this lies somewhere out there . [ Ben ] Hey , wait for me , will you ? Melinda ? I 'm afraid to stay with Aunt Lavinia and the others . I want to come with you . [ Reed ] We 've got to get started . - Coming , Reed . Hang on . - [ Melinda ] Ahh ! - Did you have to do that ? - Heck , yeah . Now , come on . [ bats squeaking ] - [ bat squeaks ] - Oh , Johnny ! Melinda ! Johnny , I specifically requested ... I 'm sure she 'll be no trouble . And we 've no time to take her back . Oh , with your yadda , yadda , yadda . Let 's get going already . We get hassled underwater by Prince Namor , bugged in ancient Greece by Doctor Doom , and now we 're stranded in a cockamamie cavern ! Gee , just once I 'd like a problem that took us to Vegas . Reed , what can be causing this strange light so far under the earth ? Phosphorescent minerals in the cavern walls . But they 're gaining their intensity from some incredibly powerful energy source . Almost like an underground sun . [ Ben ] Oh , great , now that you 've explained it , we 're still up the creek without a paddle . I think it would be best if we split up here . We can use our communicators to keep in touch . Johnny , you and Melinda , with me . Sue , you and Ben try that tunnel . This way . [ hissing ] Gas ! It could be explosive , Johnny . You 'd better not flame up until we 're clear of it . Ahhh ! [ Johnny ] Must flame up , Reed . [ Reed ] No ! Hold tight . I think I can ride the geo-thermal updrafts . There . [ Melinda ] Oh , it 's so dark and it smells bad . I hate it . Look , this isn 't anybody 's idea of Fun City , so shape up , Melinda , we 've got a job to do . Johnny , Melinda , there seems to be a light source up ahead . [ high-pitched humming ] [ Johnny ] I ... feel dizzy . - What 's happening ? - [ Reed ] Don 't look . - [ Reed ] What on earth ? - [ Johnny ] Or under it . [ Reed ] Unbelievable . Diamonds as big as boulders . And we 're not alone in this crystal-encrowded kingdom . - [ creatures babbling ] - [ Reed ] Look out . They 're some species of belligerent troglodyte . Bye-bye , baddies ! I am the Mole Man ! Supreme ruler of the world within the earth . All that is here is mine ! [ Reed ] Then this is your doing ? The Arch of Triumph , the pyramid , Parliament and now Rock Center ? Ha ha ! Rock Center is now at the center of this rock . Ha , ha , ha ! Ironic , isn 't it ? - Crazy 's more like it . - Not crazy ! Brilliant . By bringing the world 's landmarks into my domain , I have displayed the awesome power with which I will seize control of the surface of the earth as well . And none will dare stand against me because I have defeated you . Reed Richards ! Johnny Storm ! You and your colleagues , the so-called Fantastic Four . Then you took Radio City just to get us ? Of course ! You are the only surface beings who might have challenged my power . Reed Richards . The only scientist who is my equal . And you have been neutralized ! We 're not quite neutralized yet ! Flame on ! [ Reed ] Watch out for his staff , Johnny . It 's some type of power generator . He 's using it on those stalactites . The next one will pin her to the floor of the cavern , permanently . - [ Reed ] No , that won 't be necessary . - I knew you 'd respond to reason . Follow me ! Johnny , make them stop . Leland Armbruster would sue them . Reed , can you hear me ? Something must be wrong . [ splash , squelch ] Yeuch ! Icky clay . It 's like walking in glue . - Yeuch . - The clay is alive ! It 's a monster ! [ Ben ] All right . I ain 't never clobbered clay before , though . You did it . It seems to have returned to wherever it came from . Yeah , lucky I got it off so easy . Come on , let 's blow this dump . Ben , look , an underground ocean . It 's incredible ! [ Ben ] Sheesh ! And me without my rubber ducky ! Holy baloney ! [ Sue ] The entire cavern is alive with clay monsters ! [ roars ] Head for that island . Water dissolves clay . They won 't be able to follow us . [ Ben ] Yeah , for once , we 'll do it the easy way . ¶ Way down upon the Swanee River Do you hear her everybody ? Now , come along and sing along , all of you . ¶ Far , far away All right ! Scratch that . That 's quite enough gloom and doom for one evening . When I was a child , we British came through the Blitz with a song on our lips , and that song was ... [ starts to sing ] Remove their protective garments ! - Hey , careful ! - Don 't mess my hair , you creep ! Your initial sensitivity to the mineral brilliance of my kingdom has passed . It is now safe for you to look upon my wealth without harm . Why are you doing this , Mole Man ? We 've never harmed you . You and all who live above these caverns harmed me , Reed Richards ! And now my masterpiece , an Earth Suction Generator . I used it to bring down the pyramids , Parliament and the Rockefeller Center , using only a fraction of its power . And tomorrow morning , the great cities of the world will sink into my domain ! And the reign of Mole Man shall begin ! Oh , don 't let him drop me ! Please , don 't ! Back off , or I flambé the valley girl . [ electric buzzing ] The only chance we have now is Sue and Ben . I pray they 're all right . [ Ben ] Stroke , kick . Stroke , kick . Sheesh , what a drag ! Let 's get to the top of the ridge . Maybe I can get through to Reed from there . Well , it ain 't Coney Island , but at least it ain 't clay . Hey , funny . It felt like the whole island just kind of twitched . I felt it too . And , Ben , Reed 's homing signal . I 've locked onto it . Oh ! It 's twitching again , Susie . Oh , boy ! Look , it 's a blasted turtle as big as the Bronx ! Hey , I ain 't dinner , honey . I 'm a passenger . Which way to Reed , Susie ? - There ! - Giddy up , horsie . Ride ' em , cowboy ! Yee hah ! [ Mole Man ] Once the process has begun , it cannot be reversed . I leave you now to take my post beneath Washington . When the White House sinks , I will be there to take control . Upon my return as all-powerful ruler of the surface world , I will deal with you and the other two members of the Fantastic Four . If they 've survived my guardian monsters ! Farewell ! The Mole Man 's Suction Generator is fuelled by power from the earth 's core . Even if we get free , we can 't turn it off without splitting the planet in two . [ Melinda ] Oh , what 's happening ? I 'm getting seasick . Here 's Benny Boy ! Hey , look out below ! Hey , thanks for the ride , ol ' paint . - [ neighs ] - Take a hike . Sue , I knew you 'd find us . I never gave up hope , darling . It 's good to see you both . [ Melinda ] Get me down . I can 't stand heights . Bring her down with your invisible force shield . - Johnny and I have work to do . - Right , Reed . When I give you the signal , inject a flame into that circuit . But you said you can 't stop the suction process . I 'm not going to stop it . I 'm going to accelerate it . - Now ! - I don 't get it , but okay . Quick , everyone back to the rainbow room . We haven 't much time . [ Sue ] I don 't understand . [ Ben ] I never understand nothing he says . [ Reed ] Hurry . Ouch ! Can 't you turn down the barbecue ? Will you , huh ? Ooh , ow , ow , ooh ! [ sings nonsensical song ] [ Reed ] Miss Forbes , we 're back . - Melinda , Doctor Richards ... - [ low rumbling ] ... Mr. Grimm and whatsisname . [ barks ] Shut up , Foo Foo . What 's happening ? I 'm a busy person . I have no more time to waste on this folderol . Then you 'll be glad to see we 're returning to the surface . But how ? Well , it was impossible to turn off or reverse Mole Man 's Suction Generator . But it was a simple matter to reprogram the target of its power . [ Ben ] Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , spray that again , big brain . [ Reed ] I simply aimed the Generator 's power on the Mole Man 's kingdom . [ Sue ] You mean he goes down as we go up ? [ Reed ] Better than that , dear . It means he stays down . [ strains ] Ha ha ! No one bests the Mole Man ! My power is irresistible ! - [ Ben ] Hey , we 're going down again . - [ Sue ] No ! Reed ! [ Forbes ] Help ! Dial 911 ! [ Reed ] Not to worry . The Mole Man created the Suction Generator . It 's ironic , but not even he has the power to stop it . Oh , what ? No ! It 's not possible ! Aggghhh ! [ deep rumbling ] - ¶ And on , and on ... - [ Reed ] It looks like a bright new day . ¶ Flame on I just flame on ¶ ¶ There 's Galactus looking hungry ¶ And Doctor Doom is near ¶ Here come the Skrulls invading ¶ Do you run and hide in fear ? ¶ No way , no way , no way ¶ Just call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four ¶ That 's all , no more Now , that 's grammatical ¶ Reed Richards is elastic ¶ Sue can fade from sight ¶ Johnny is the Human Torch ¶ The Thing just loves to fight ¶ Call for the Four ¶ Fantastic Four

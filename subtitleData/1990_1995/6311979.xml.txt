 - the name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years , I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now- - Well , let 's just say " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - Coming up on a-58 here in demeter , looks like another beautiful day under the suns . Now , let 's check out the local traffic scene . - Thanks , Gooch . We 're getting reports of a light dirigible and a transhopper colliding on flyway 284 this morning . Looks like that area will be jammed until at least half past 13 . For an alternate route , the Mandeville bypass looks like the best bet . Gooch ? - In financial news , the mantor index shot up by Three point seven units yesterday , a good indication that the credit exchange rate is holding fast against other planetary currencies . Analysts say the recent influx of- - - Don 't tell I 'm late , Noah ! It 's only 9 . - and Tyler and chandlus are already here ! - But the presentation was set for 10 . - These guys are on client time . The presentation is whenever they want it ! Get down here , jo , now ! - Client time ? What about my time ? - No ! - Nine-One-One emergency services . Can I help you ? - Ah ! - We have a 911 in suburb Delta , unit 4-B . Resident of record , a miss jonita styles . - Can you Patch us in , fredo ? - Negative . We 've lost contact with the caller . But it was in progress , and it 's bad . - Okay . - Four-B ? - That 's too damn close to home . - Dcpd . Is anybody there ? Is anybody there ? - After you . Uh , it 's Brogan . We 've got a 187 , female tarn . - copy that , Brogan . Backup 's on its way . - It 's in the garden . - Yeah . - Wait or go ? - go . - Headshot , maximum power . - Come on , castle . I 'm a rounder , not a hitter . You know that . - people change , zipload . - Not me ! Look , I don 't know nothin ' about this jonita styles thing . I swear ! Oh , cut me some Slack , guys . - Give us a reason to . - I just left the collection depot where this Hopper blew past me . - And about what time was that ? - I was doing the 3 : 30 a.M. Run from dc central , so it 'd be right around then . Anyways , I didn 't think much of it ' til I got to suburb Delta , and the same Hopper was just sittin ' there in stationary orbit . I don 't know . It just seemed kinda strange . Guy is in a big hurry to get somewhere . Then , he parks it . - Did you get a look at the driver ? - No , sorry . It had a one-Way windshield . - Yeah , well , you can say the neighborhood 's a little shook up about it . - What about Matt and Liz ? - Well , I- - - Mom ! Matt stole the remote ! - Matt , Liz ! I am on the screen . - But I need it ! There 's somethin I wanna watch ! - Well , either sort it out or calm down . Wait ' til I 'm finished . As you can see , they 're severely traumatized . - Styles ' business associate , Noah Ingram , just arrived . - Yeah , duty calls . - Yeah , Well , mine , too- - See ya . - Ow ! Mom , Liz whacked me ! - I didn 't touch you ! - You did , too . - Did not ! - Did , too ! - Didn 't ! - Get tweaked . - I didn 't hit you , Matt ! - You did , too- - She started it . - That 's a lie . - look , I don 't really care who started it . Every time I get on the screen , you two act up . Here ! Aw , will you look at that ? - in the past , a magic here wouldn 't have survived on altor . Earth dogs have no natural immunity to creon fever . But with the development of aladine-50 , we now have a vaccine . - and remember , for a chance to win one of demeter dogs recent arrivals , just pick up an entry form at your local multistore . Time to say " Bye-Bye , " magic . - Mom ? Do we need anything at the store ? - Get virtual , Liz . You know what the chances of winning a contest like that are ? - Zero , unless we try . - Ah , she 's got you there , bud . Yes , I 'm going down to the store later . I 'll pick one up for ya . - Massive , mom . - Massive . Massive . - So , Mr. Ingram , according to the comm log , you were the last person jonita styles called before she dialed 911 . - Poor jo . - Did she seem worried or upset about anything when you spoke ? - Only that our clients were being difficult , but that 's jonita . Her work is her life . - Look , Mr. Ingram . I know This is difficult , But was there anything out of the ordinary ? - Let me think . Not really . Although , I suppose , thinking back , there was this guy . - Like a boyfriend ? - No-No . He was hanging out near the office . I suppose I never really thought anything about it . But now- - - Think you might recognize him , again ? - Yeah , I-I guess . - You 're doing fine , Mr. Ingram . - Just keep concentrating . Start running that through the database . - It 's simultaneous , haldane . - I knew that . - Forensics turn up anything at the styles ' place ? - Other than the bodies of jonita and her dog , nothing . - No dna from the tissue samples ? - Oh , yeah . We got dna all right . The problem is we can 't get a reading off it . - What about forced entry ? - No . It 's like the perp came out of nowhere . - You two turned up anything ? - You want the good news or the bad ? - Do I look like I 'm in the mood for guessing games , haldane ? - Right . Ingram saw this guy a couple of times around styles ' office . We put out an apb on him- - See if he wants to have a chat . - Species ? - That 's the bad news , captain . We haven 't got a clue . - This isn 't easy for any of us , kenzie , but we still have to carry on . Now , um , we 'll need to meet with the lawyers first thing in the morning . - Yes , sir . I 've located the incorporation papers , sir . And I have a list of all outstanding accounts . But I can 't find a copy of miss Styles ' will . - I 'll handle it . Ah ! - Liz- - Matt ! School transit , five minutes . Be right there , mom . - Hey ! - Mom ! - I 'm gonna kill you , Matt ! - Get tweaked . - give it back ! - Hey ! What 's going on here ? - Just interacting with weirdness . - He stole my entry form to the demeter dogs contest . - I wasn 't gonna keep it . - Matt . Looks like you 've been workin ' pretty hard on this . - Yeah . Part of the contest is to write a poem . - Dumb . - It 's not dumb ! - Yeah , well , prove it . - " my brother , Matt , tells me I can 't write . " ' get tweaked , ' he says , and we have a fight . " I say , ' get tweaked yourself , ' " Gnarled up in a furrow . " ' I won 't be jacked 'til a demeter dog " is hanging in our borough . ' " Thrash . " - Orbital . - Hey , guys ! It 's time . Matt , take off those blades . You know Mr. Carlington won 't let you on the transit with those things on . - Yeah , I know . - Come on . - Now , Matt , you will take off those blades . - I 'll take them off at the transit stop . - Fine , make sure you do . Now , I made you squash today . It 's all I have . Make sure you eat it . - All right . - Bye ! - Hi , Bye , uncle Jack . - Ditto . - Well , hello . - You 're early- - What 's up ? - Noah Ingram . - I 'm sorry to get you in so early , but I thought you 'd like to see this one before Forensics bagged everything . As far as they can tell from the condition of the body , it happened sometime yesterday evening . The secretary found him here this morning . She didn 't stop screaming until we arrived on the scene . - Same m.O. As jonita styles ? - Looks like it , so far . - Lieutenant ? Mr. Douglas looks after the building . - Yeah . I was just telling OFFICER took here- - I saw a Hopper last night . It landed warfside , right up front . - Can you describe it ? - I sure can . And I got a good look at the driver when he got out , too . - Does This guy look familiar ? - Yeah , that 's him . That 's a dead Ringer . - All right . Get out a description of the Hopper to all the other precincts and anybody else who 'll play ball . - Directory assistance for ril koprov , one ninety-Three flyover boulevard , east one . - Are you sure it 's the man we 're looking for ? - I told ya . I don 't know , but I 'm sure it was the same Hopper . - All units , be advised . We have a reported sighting . Styles , Ingram , murder suspect 's Hopper , zone seven west . - Yeah , copy that , fredo . We got him . Closing on him now . [ sirens blare ] - This is the police . Reduce your speed and descend to ground level , at once . This guy 's cut into our frequency . I don 't believe this ! - This is lieutenant Brogan , dcpd . Identify yourself . - Why are you pursuing me ? - Reduce your speed and descend . We 'll discuss it on the ground . - I can 't do that , lieutenant . But I 'm not a murderer . - something you said ? - I love this job . Got him now ! He 's got no way out . It 's a dead end . - You were saying ? - Shut up . - Brogan , we 're on the main line . We 're talking trains , Brogan ! This is crazy . - I said shut up ! [ Horn blares ] - Brogan ! - Hang on ! Don 't say it . - Officer haldane , we lost you there for a few . - Yeah , and we lost the bad guy somewhere off the subway line , zone eight . - Great . - I 'm buying . - Yeah . Ah , I 'll take this . You get the coffee . - You want a Burger or anything ? - Lieutenant , we 've got more on your mystery man . - Let 's have it , fredo . - He 's an aired . Planet of origin , nevin three , one of the rim worlds . - Never heard of it . - No reason why you should . All the data we got is the military 's . There 's some kind of civil war going on there . - Okay . Thanks , fredo . Ah , gotta get a cup of coffee . - Lieutenant . - Brogan ? Damn it ! - You do what I say . I won 't hurt you . I repeat . I am not a murderer . - Yeah . Any reason why I should believe you ? - No , but you have my word . I didn 't kill styles and Ingram . - Yeah , well , I got witnesses that put you at the scene of both crimes . - Well , I was indeed close , but I was only observing . - Observing murders ? - I intercepted a coded communique sent from my planet to altor . Styles and Ingram were involved with the omera . - You lost me . - the omera , a nomadic race from beyond the rim worlds . Thieves- - killers . They 've looted dozens of planets , including my own , and altor is their next target . - What are you telling me ? Altor is about to be invaded ? - Yeah , eventually . It may not seem like it now , But my planet was taken by surprise . It was all over before we knew it had begun . - Well , why come to me ? Why not go to the military ? - No , no , no , no . The risks are too great . The omerans will have Spies everywhere . If you had worked for them , you 'd have blown me out of the sky when you first pursued me . - You know , I gotta tell ya . This is a little hard to believe . You 're saying that styles and Ingram were killed by this omera ? - That is the way the omerans work . They use people , often without their knowledge , until they 've served their purpose . And then , they dispose of them . - Well , what 's in it for you ? Why are you doing this ? - Revenge , I suppose , and because I cannot let them destroy another people like they did mine . Move down and hover over that building there . - So , what do we do here ? - The omera communique mentioned one other name , koprov . This is where he lives . Now , maybe he will lead us to the omera . - that the guy ? - Yes , that 's him . Very good . Now , follow . - What if I say , " no ? " - I 've lost everything , lieutenant . Family , home , friends all gone . The only thing I have to live for is the destruction of the omera . Now , you can either assist me or oppose me . There is no middle ground . - ah ! No ! - Going in . - Ah ! Without koprov , we have nowhere to go ! No way of uncovering the omera 's plan against altor ! - What 's with this " We " stuff ? I 'm not your partner . I 'm the cop you abducted , remember ? - Then I suppose we had better call it a day . - Uh , wait . We can follow the paper Trail . Ingram , styles , koprov , they all had money , power , connections . Easy to track . It might lead us to the omera . - Where do we begin ? - Well , we begin with you telling me your name . You owe me that much . - Vachel . My name is vachel . - All right , vachel . Come with me to the station . Tell my captain your story . - No-No . The risk is too great . I 'll contact you ! - You buy this fella 's story about intergalactic conspiracies and alien invasions ? - Well , I-I don 't wanna ignore it , captain . - that 's not exactly an answer to my question , lieutenant . Help me out here , okay ? - Yes , sir . - This , uh , vachel character is being connected with two , maybe three murders , correct ? - Correct . - He snatches you at gunpoint , rips up a police cruiser in the process , then tells you a wild story about an army on its way to attack altor . - It does sound kinda whacko , Brogan . - Thanks , haldane . - Anytime . - look , I trust your instincts , Brogan . But how could I take this to a higher authority without any evidence to support what you just told me ? - Uh , you can 't . - there you are , lieutenant . I 've been scanning for you . - Well , he 's been upstairs getting his Butt chewed by podly . - What do you mean , slomo ? - I am well aware of his colloquial meaning , lieutenant . I was just uploading a gigabyte . I have cross-Referenced the data from the three victims personal files . The information is on your personal screen now . Gotta go . - Thanks , slomo ! - Duly stored . Officer romek , I 've uploaded those files on your recidivist from planet Danae . - Huh . Styles and Ingram were on 11 boards- - Lbx data , sky metal ... man , these guys must 've been making a hell of a lot of money . - Yeah . Koprov was even higher on the food chain- - Chairman of row chemicals , easy mega tools , creon industries . What is the common denominator here ? Here it is . They were all on the board of the same company together- - Demeter dogs , incorporated . That 's funny . Liz just entered a contest they 've been having . - You know , styles had a dog . So did koprov . Did Ingram ? - I don 't know . One never turned up . Might be worth a visit . - Once the dogs are inoculated with aladine-50 , they are guaranteed a life free from creon fever , Mr. Needham . - hmm . Well , then I guess the last question is , how much ? - I beg your pardon ? - The cost . I assume you 're not in the habit of giving your dogs away . - Very True , But , uh , money isn 't the only consideration . Our dogs are only placed in the best homes . - Ah , that 's refreshing . - Freeze frame . Match and identify . Well , it appears Mr. Needham isn 't exactly who he says he is . Let 's see if we can find out more about lieutenant Brogan . - So , this stuff is supposed to be a cure for creon fever , huh ? - Yeah , but I think we 'll let forensics be the judge of that . - we can 't execute the plan yet . The timing of the operation is absolutely essential . You know that , slan . - I know that we should keep our heads , exeter . So , what have you found out about Brogan ? - He 's heading up the styles , Ingram murder investigations . - Exeter , see that lieutenant Brogan keeps out of our way . - But how ? - Be inventive . - Liz , um , there 's a visitor here to see you . He wants to talk to you about your poem . - I-I won the contest ? You mean , like , I can keep him ? - Yes to the first question , and indeed you can to the second . With your mother 's permission , of course . - Oh , yes . Yes , of course . - don 't mind her . She 's just jealous . Can 't wait ' til dad gets home . He 's gonna be so surprised . - Good idea , Liz . Don 't tell your father yet . Wait ' til he gets back . Then you can give him a big surprise . - hmm . - Oops- - Sorry . - excuse me , slomo . Jane , did you run that background check on exeter yet ? - His record is as long as an elan 's tail- - Petty scams , cons , that sort of thing . - Great . Thanks . - Yeah . Thanks , castle . - Careful , haldane . I can read your mind like an open book . - Oh , et tu , tooky . - Bye , haldane . - Your contact at military intelligence wouldn 't tell you anything ? - Soon as I mentioned the omera , he clammed up . - Loose lips vaporize spaceships . Oh . - The military won 't confirm or deny the existence of the omera . - Yeah . What about the Zena base scan ? - Zip . - We 're at a dead end , lieutenant . - lieutenant , I just received a download from forensic on your investigation . Interesting . - It 's a very complex molecule with polyvalent bonds , but it 's definitely not a vaccine . - Could be a scam . Make a pile of dough . Grab a fast ship to another star system . - Yeah . You ever know a grifter who wouldn 't just sell to the highest bidder , no questions asked ? What about the autopsy on styles ' dog ? - Ah , now we get to the good stuff . After re-Examining the animal , we found this embedded in its skull . - part of a bullet ? - No . - It 's a silicone chip . - go to the top of the class , Officer haldane . Best guess , it 's some sort of neural implant . - Well , an explosive one , judging by the damage it did to the dog 's head . - Yep , but that 's not all . We could tell from looking at the architecture of the fragment that it was designed to radiate a signal . We didn 't know what kind or what for . So , on the off chance , I thought I 'd try bombarding the aladine-50 with a few different signals . When I hit the beta spectrum , I got a result . Look . And when I turn it off- - - So , this stuff is injected into the dogs that have the implants . I 'm starting to get the picture . - It would alter the dog 's dna and drive it mad . - From pet to predator in the blink of an eye . - No , I 'm not sending Sophie away . Come on , girl . Shake hands . Shake hands . Sophie . - Sophie ? What a jengus name . Why don 't you label her somethin ' resin like head banger ? - Because her name 's Sophie . - Hello , Sophie . How 's my girl ? What is wrong with zil ? - Zil doesn 't like Sophie 's name , either . - Oh , she 's just jealous . Quiet , zil ! - That 's it . I 'm outta here . I 'll study at the library . - Okay . [ ringing ] Oh , I 'll get that . - Come on , soph . Sophie , shake hands . Shake hands , Sophie . - Okay . That 's okay . But just try to get home early because Liz has a surprise . - What kind of surprise ? - Well , it 's just something she wants to show you . - It 's comm nine . It 's either an INFORMANT , or you 've taken a serious turn for the weird . - Um , gotta go , Sal . - Okay . - Brogan ! - You got him . Talk . - Brogan . I need to speak to you . - Hey , where 's my 20 credits ? - Brogan , have you made any progress ? - Some . The omera is using an outfit called demeter dogs as their center of operations . How soon can you move on them ? - We can 't , not yet . They 've made some very powerful friends . - Brogan , they are the omera . They will destroy This whole civilization unless I stop them first . - You 're a long way from home , my aired friend . - I have no home , since you omerans destroyed it ! - Oh , exactly how much do you know of our plan here ? Kill him . - the police know you killed styles , koprov , and Ingram . - Oh , I see . It 's you that 's been talking to Brogan . So , you 've managed to convince one insignificant lieutenant that altor is going to be invaded . Too bad he won 't live long enough to persuade other people . Once our dog is activated , no one in the Brogan house will be sounding any alarm bells . Will you do me the honor ? - He 's wearing a wire ! - Freeze ! - Ah ! Say goodbye to your family , lieutenant . - No ! - Mom , where 's the jelly ? - Come on . Come on . [ ringing , growling ] - Mom ? Mom ? - No answer . - Maybe they 're out . - Sophie ! Mom ! - Let me have it . - does it stop transmitting ? - I don 't know . Sally ! Where 's the dog ? - With Liz , I think . - Dad ! - Are you all right ? - fine . I got a surprise for you . Her name 's Sophie . Come on . Come on , Sophie . She was acting kinda funny earlier , but she 's fine now . What 's the matter with you ? - Uh , nothing . Everything 's fine . Everything 's just fine . - You captured all of the omeran Spies ! - Yeah , most of ' em . The rest are on the run . - Then there will be no invasion , at least of this planet . - Not on any planet , vachel . A battalion from the league of planets found them lying low in the straits of nebulon . The omerans are gone for good . - then it 's over . Thank you . - Ah , you got nobody to thank but yourself . - Good journey . - Mesmerized dogs attacking all the most powerful people ? That 's amazing . - What I find amazing is how difficult it is for you to spot the obvious . - I don 't have a problem spotting the obvious , castle . - that 's not obvious to me . - Obviously . - I don 't understand their relationship , either . So , where are you headed off to now ? - home to nevin three to rebuild what the omerans have destroyed . - Well , good luck to you . - and to you , too . - Did we make it ? - Yeah , just in time . - You guys are wrong ! There 's no implant thing in Sophie 's head . - It 's there , honey . - Then how come she didn 't do anything to me when it told her to ? - Well , who knows ? Maybe it was defective . - um , maybe she just loves you so much she couldn 't hurt you . - Then how come we have to send her back to earth ? - Honey , all the dogs have to go back . If they don 't , they 'll catch creon fever and die . - we can 't wait any longer . - Bye , Sophie . Sophie , paw . Paw . Good . - Come on , Sophie . Come on . Good girl . Sit , Sophie . That a girl . - Bye . " Sophie 's " a stupid name for a dog . - Hey .

 Whoa , whoa . Easy . Easy . - Morning . - Morning . Y 'all mind stepping aside ? - You know what I think ? - No , sir , I don 't . I think you got yourselves a shipment of gold in that wagon that you 're bringing to General Lee . And just who might you be ? - A friend of the Confederacy . Why don 't y 'all just show us what a good friend you are by stepping aside ? I 'd be most happy to except first , I 'd be much obliged if you 'd give me that gold . - I don 't think I heard you correct . - I think you did . I 'd like that gold now . Listen , mister , it ain 't very nice out here , as you can plainly see . There are five of us . I don 't know what y 'all are about . If you don 't step aside now , I 'd just as soon kill you as not . You wanna die out here in this miserable weather ? That 's your choice . I 'm gonna ask you one more time . Would you please give me the gold ? Good afternoon , senators . The president is very grateful for your time here . Believe me , this is a matter of the utmost importance . I cannot stress too much the utmost secrecy . Why don 't you just cut out the shit , George ? You 're here to ask the committee for money , so come on out and ask for it . Thanks for the advice , senator . You 're right , I am gonna ask you for money . And guess what else ? You 're gonna give it to me . You all remember Dr. Hans Kleindast , the Nobel laureate who helped us during the space program ? For the past 20 years , he 's been trying to keep his face off the cover of TIME magazine , doing research . His field of research has been time travel . - Time travel ? Yeah , time travel . - Well , beam me up , Scotty . That 's very funny , senator . - Wanna know what 's funnier than that ? - I get the feeling he 's gonna tell us . The funny thing is , the good doctor actually did it . I thought that would get your attention . That 's right , he did it . The technology 's all in the folders in front of you . You won 't understand it . Now , you can 't go forward , because the future hasn 't happened yet . However , you can go back , and that 's where things get real tricky . Turns out , if you go back and change something , it 's serious . It could be catastrophic . Like throwing a stone in a lake and it causes ripples in the water . Only , they 're ripples in time . So you can 't go back and kill Hitler , much as we 'd all like to because it could cause a chain reaction of events that could alter or even destroy mankind . And that , my good senators , is where you come in . We have to form a brand-new covert agency to police this technology and to actually protect time . It 's gonna be called the Time Enforcement Commission , or the T.E.C. This man is Commander Eugene Matuzak of the Washington Police Department . He is our choice to run the commission . How much is this gonna cost ? - A lot . - How much is a lot ? More than a little and less than too much . This is not a good time to ask for money . You know , the economy - Suppose one of our foreign competitors goes back in time and invents the computer ? Or the airplane or automobile ? Wanna talk about the state of the American economy ? How about this one ? Saddam Hussein finances a trip back to 1944 . He gets our technology and Iraq becomes the first country to have the atomic bomb . - Oh , you like that one . - Not bad . Try this one on for size . We think there 's already been a ripple . Ten days ago . CIA broke up an arms sale to Middle-Eastern terrorists in Hamburg , Germany . That 's happened before , so that news doesn 't come across the president 's desk . What made this one different is that the purchase was made with gold bullion . And the gold bullion was dated 1863 and stamped : Property of the Confederate States of America . We had it carbon tested and authenticated , and it 's real . Now , just think about what I 'm saying . Going back in time is a pretty easy way to make money . Our committee would have exclusive jurisdiction over this program ? Yours and yours alone , and no one can know about this . It 's too dangerous . That 's very good , George . Personally , I think this sounds like that bullshit Star Wars program . You 'll probably get your money . Anyone here wanna chair the oversight on this program ? Yeah , I 'll do it . Ah . Young Senator McComb . Why not ? You 'll like him , George . He 's very much like you , except his dorsal fin 's a bit bigger . There 's never enough time . Never enough for what ? To satisfy a woman . Then you never wanna miss an opportunity . Are you busy ? I 'm meeting my husband . If I were him , I would not keep you waiting . If he 's not here when I turn around , I 'll go home with you . You 'll do . - I didn 't hear you leave this morning . - It was early . I was meeting with Matuzak . Are you gonna take that job ? - What ? - Be right back . Read it . - " Wolverine " ? - Between the lines . - I should get the fuck out of here . - Good . You know , that purse doesn 't look good on you . - Thank you . - Glad you 're not hurt . - Are you okay ? - Thank you . Smart kid . He read my mind . With your English , he doesn 't have much choice . Hey , I know all the good words . You didn 't answer my question . Are you gonna take this job ? I think so . Is this T.E.C. thing dangerous ? I don 't bake cookies for a living . - Will you have to travel ? - Not the way you think . Pictures bring back your memories . Aw . You 're gonna be very happy you have this . Why ? I can see into the future . You can see the future , huh ? Mm-hm . - What do you see ? - I see it 's gonna rain . We both have the afternoon off . Why don 't we go and practice some of those words you seem to like so much ? - Max ? - Hm ? What ? I have something I wanna tell you . - Shit . I 'm sorry . - Don 't answer it . Just this once , don 't answer it . I have to . Walker . Now ? Oh , Jesus Christ . Can you find somebody else ? Look , somebody called in sick and - And there 's nobody but Max Walker to keep the streets safe . I said I was sorry . It 's not like I have a choice . Of course you have a choice . - This is what I do . - I know that 's what you do . It 's just that things are different now . What are you talking about ? - This isn 't the way I wanted to do this . - I have to go . There 's something you need to tell me ? Yes . - Can you wait until I get back ? - Sure . Surprise . Max ! Max ! - Max ! - Melissa . - Max ! - Finish him . Who are you ? You 're a smart boy . Why don 't you sleep on it a while ? Max ! Max ! Max ! Max ! There 's nothing funny to see over there , it 's just another jumper . As soon as this car clears , I want you to go . - Hang on there , buddy . All right , folks , that 's close enough . - Close enough . Thank you . Step back , folks . Did you see what happened ? Come on , break it up . There 's nothing to see . Go back to work . Come on . Come on , now . Come on , now . Break it up . Go back to work . Come on . Come on , get out of here . Good morning , Mr. Atwood . - Morning , Charlie . - It 's a terrible day . Paper , mister ? - Beat it . - Terrible . What 's going on ? Mr. Floatbauer . He swan dived right out the window . He went off the roof . Oh , yeah . Well , shit happens . Excuse me . Oh , that poor man . - Good morning , Pete . Good morning , Mr. Atwood . Third jumper this week . They keep this up , Pete , you 're gonna be out of a job . Only going down , sir . There he is . You 've got the papers - - Oh , Mr. Atwood , isn 't this terrible ? - Tragic . Get me Ross . Ross , hi . Yeah , listen . I want another 100,000 shares of Middle States Oil . No , no , no . Just buy it . It 's an act of faith . I really think things are gonna turn around . I got a feeling about the future . Hey , look , I gotta go . I 'm very busy . - Walker . - How have you been , Lyle ? - How you doing , partner ? - Ex-partner . Max . I 'm not gonna change a thing . The only ripples are gonna be in my swimming pool . It 's a nice place . You couldn 't do this by yourself . Who you working for ? Look , I 'm not hurting anybody . It 's America , man . You know , I was just taking an opportunity , that 's all . I 've got to take you back . I went 10 rounds with John L. Sullivan himself . I saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV . - Mr. Atwood - Ah ! Oh , my God . - Get down . Doesn 't look too good , Lyle . Let me go , Max . I 'll stay here . I won 't go back . - Who sent you ? I want the name . - It 's not gonna make any difference . In a few weeks , this guy 's gonna run the whole country . If he doesn 't get the money here , he 's gonna get it somewhere else . I can 't tell you anything . He 'll send somebody back to wipe out my grandparents . It 'll be like I never existed . My mother , my father , my wife , my kids , my fucking cat . You ever hear of the name Aaron McComb ? Senator McComb ? - Bullshit . - You don 't understand . He 's gonna be president . He 's doing this to get money for his campaign . Shit , Max , he already owns most of the guys we work with . When we get back , you 'll point them out . You 're out of your mind . This guy 's gonna roll right over you . - We 'll see . Let 's go . - Listen to me . If I go back and talk , my family is dead . I 'm talking about my f - My family . If I die here , it 's only me . I can 't go back . I have to bring you back . I have no choice . Neither do I. Holy mother of Mary . Lieutenant Clapton , 0316 . Lieutenant Clapton . Testify and I 'll do what I can . Communication relays rerouted to Alpha-0 . Captain Lyle Atwood , you are charged with violations of T.E.C. code 40.8 subsection 9 , time travel with intent to alter the future . The charges are compounded by your current status as a time-enforcement officer . - Does the defendant have any statement ? - Tell her . Agent Atwood , have you something to say on your own behalf ? - Yes . - No . Then I will pass sentence as mandated by our charter . Say something . Come on . Say something . - The defendant has been found guilty . - Take care of yourself , Max . - sentence of death to be carried out immediately . Poor bastard . Tomorrow might have been a brighter day . We 're picking up some noise outside Camp David , ' 79 . Intelligence thinks it 's a kill team out of Iran . If it is , it 's their third try this year . CIA 's trying to locate their launch facility and take it out . I want two teams on this date , before and after . Let 's smoke these guys . Los Angeles , 1902 . Somebody 's trying to get a jump on the real-estate boom . They 're buying what 's gonna be Beverly Hills for chump change . - Burr , you and Swain got the deal . - Yes , sir . You look like shit . - We have to talk . - In a minute . - Now . - I said , in a minute . Temporary wave guide shutdown in three minutes . Shit . Go over your dispatch notes and check with me before you launch . All right . Good afternoon , gentlemen . - George . - Gene . - Senator Nelson , T.E.C. Director Matuzak . - Mr. Matuzak . Senator Nelson is the newest member of the Oversight Committee . He 's gonna vote on your annual budget , he 'd like to see how it 's being spent . Senator McComb , our long-standing committee chairman agreed to take time out from his presidential campaign to accompany us . Senator . It 'll be a pleasure to show you around . Tell me , are these all of your agents ? Most of them . Agent Monroe . Agent Anderson . Agents Burr , Bartolo and Shepherd . - Agent Walker . - Agent Walker . - I 've heard a great deal about you . - And I 've heard a lot about you , senator . Not all of it bad , I hope . Agent Walker just returned from a successful mission . Well , congratulations , Agent Walker . Senator , Director Matuzak will show you the launch room . Follow me . I 'll show you where we kick off . Gene , you wouldn 't mind if Agent Walker accompanied us , would you ? I 'd love to hear about his most recent mission . - I have a report to file . - Agent Walker would be delighted . All units , switch to T.E.C. channel three . All units , switch to T.E.C. channel three . As you can see , we 've spared every expense . No comfort , no convenience , no necessities . Watch your head . So , Agent Walker , your latest mission , who were you after ? A man named Atwood . Ring a bell ? Atwood . No . Should that name be familiar to me ? - Unfortunately , Atwood was a T.E.C. agent . - Really ? That 's the sort of thing that happens . I don 't wanna sound like a broken record but that 's one of the dangers of having an agency like this . Imagine the dangers of not having it . - Did you know this Atwood ? - He was my partner . Oh , I 'm sorry . Nothing worse than a rogue cop . - Except the guy who paid him . - If there is such a guy . - There always is . - Do you know who the man is ? - Oh , yeah . - Why don 't you arrest him ? - I lost my witness . - Oh . - Well , I trust you 'll keep working on it . - You can bet on it . Hydrogen specialists , prepare for inspection . We 've updated our entire operation to state-of-the-art Parker Datalink Systems utilizing their superconducting chip . Senator McComb was Jack Parker 's partner and sold out just before the company got the patent on that chip . - Bet that cost you a few billion , huh ? - Whoa , bad luck . My deal with Jack Parker is not important , Mr. Spota . What is important is talking about the dangers of this program . - Boy , you got my vote . - Excuse me . What dangers ? Well , dishonest agents like this Atwood . Every time an agent goes back he risks making contact with a past version of himself . That could be a disaster . And why is that , sir ? The same matter can 't occupy the same space at the same time . It 's in the technical reports . However , it 's never happened . Not yet , but what I propose is far less costly yet accomplishes the same thing . Why don 't we just prevent time travel rather than spending stupendous amounts of money trying to police it ? Gentlemen , I have to get back to the Hill . Malcolm , this is a project that we could do without . I hope you vote against continued appropriations . I admire your dedication , Agent Walker . - I hope you keep trying to get your man . - I never quit . We 've done a breakdown of the latest poll results . While trends are not what we want them to be there are some good things that we can utilize . The numbers in the suburbs are encouraging but they are killing you in the urban centers . A poll shows you 're gaining with the Pro-Life , Pro-Death Penalty coalition and with the Close Our Border America for Americans Anti-Immigration faction . The bad news is the campaign finance chairman put together a projected budget based on estimated costs from now to Election Day , and it 's a big number . Even going back again , I don 't see how you could get it all in time . Lawrence , I love you . I really do . But don 't tell me what I can 't do . Elections are won with television . You don 't need the press , don 't need endorsements . You don 't even need the truth . You need money . So tell me . How much is it gonna cost to buy the network time I need ? - Fifty million dollars . - Fifty million dollars . Agent Walker has already cost me that . I 'm gonna have a little chat with him . The kind of chat a man remembers for a lifetime . Sure is a handsome devil , isn 't he ? - He 's not my type . What did you wanna talk about ? What do you know about him ? Capable of eating his young . He sure seemed interested in you this afternoon . He interests me . - Atwood named him . - You 're shitting me . - He 's the one who sent him back . - So why didn 't he testify ? He said McComb would go after his family . He also said McComb has half of the agency . I believe him . He doesn 't have me . I said , he doesn 't have me . - Well , fuck you too . - He 's gonna close the agency . Then no one can stop him from going back . - This one is mine . - Not unless I say it is . The son of a bitch is a presidential candidate . If you haul him in , you better have enough evidence to plug up the Potomac River . - You believe me ? - I always believe you . But you 're not always right . Yeah . Turn off that machine and come over for dinner . Carol would love to see you . Thanks . Some other time . You 're allowed to have a life . I read it in a manual someplace . I 'll tell you this . If I cannot go back to save her this scumbag is not going back to steal money . Go home , Max . If you won 't come to mine , go to yours . And by the way , when I said McComb hasn 't bought me you were supposed to say , " I know that . " I know that . System initialized . - Destination , please . - Home . There are no new messages . Television . Play tape . It 's going to look exactly like this when I 'm finished . See ? Very nice . Victorian Villa Deluxe Birdhouse . This thing is gonna be bigger than our house by the time I 'm done . - Okay . - Want some help ? Want some help ? - Yeah , you can buy the birdseed . Okay . Divide all these parts into groups to determine their structural function . - I think I should ... I think I should ... - ... buy more videotapes . - ... buy more videotapes . Definitely gotta be in the mood to do this . - You were just a second ago . You were just a second ago . I think that I should start with something a little easier to put together . Huh ? Honey ? Maybe you should lay out all the parts first , then ... - You know . I think I wanna try from memory . Just find part A and work from there . The controversy over government-provided campaign funds is in the news again today . The White Supremacist Party has qualified for matching funds sparking many groups to petition for the abolition of the matching-funds practice . Meanwhile , Senator McComb 's fading presidential bid received another blow when it was denied federal campaign matching funds . Sources close to the McComb camp indicate the senator is out of money and may be forced to withdraw from the race . Though no official statement has been made independent party leaders claim that the denial will bolster their play for the upcoming presidential election . With the polls showing independent candidate Elgin Michaels trailing the incumbent by only six points - There are no new messages . Ah ! Who are you ? Who sent you ? Who sent you ? Fifty thousand volts , motherfucker . Have a nice day . Walker ? Walker ? My name 's Fielding . I 'm with Internal Affairs . He messed up my apartment . You can kill him . You 've got some more inside . Everybody freeze . - I 'm a cop . I 'm a cop . ID , ID . Get in there . You , he 's under arrest . They 're all under arrest . Assault , attempted murder , making a mess . Sector 17 , Sector 19 , report for duty in five minutes . If you 'd like , I 'll have the door removed . - I had company this morning . - You look like they stayed a while . - McComb sent them . - Did they say that ? - I said that . What does IA want with me ? - Atwood was your partner . Internal Affairs isn 't convinced you can be trusted anymore . - She 's not going to follow me around . - We 've got a phase four . You take it . Send somebody else . I wanna be where McComb is . A little refresher course in agency etiquette . I 'm the director , I direct . I authorize the missions . I make the assignments . This one 's yours . Goddamn it , Max . This agency isn 't dead yet . But if I can 't keep you from McComb , it will be . - Fielding , get in here . - She 'll get in my way . Ask her to stay behind you . She 's on the ride . You 've got an hour until launch . - You 're not funny . - I 'm never funny . Yeah ? Disturbance jumped from four to six , sir . I catch you fucking this machine again , I 'll break your neck . - Sorry , chief . - Looks like safe sex to me . - Show me . - Okay . Here we go . The ripple was steady at four , then spiked past five to six . On the big board , it looks like it set off Waimea . Somebody 's really doing a number . We 've located the point of origin , and it 's right here in Washington . - Shit . Come on , you 're out of here . - Yeah . - You should have an exhibit . - Oh , really ? All my best stuff 's at home . I really could care less whether you like me or not but you don 't know a thing about me . T - minus-3 minutes and counting . I 've been with IA for two years . I 'm field rated in weapons and tactics and speak three languages . Impressed ? - I 'm blown away . - I read the Atwood file . You didn 't mention you could read . He was your friend , and you still asked to go after him . - He crossed the line . - Or he crossed you . Launch sequence activated . Authorized personnel only , in the area . She looks just like the Vollmers . We are at T-minus-2 minutes and counting . Why is everyone so nervous ? When a launch goes wrong , they 're the guys who scrape the wall . And by the way , you do look like the Vollmer twins . Who are the Vollmer twins ? Launch personnel only , in the bay . T - minus-1 minute , 30 seconds and counting . Magnetic field polarity initiation in 10 seconds . Telemetry check is initiated . Are we gonna blast to the past ? Yee-haw ! Green for launch . I 've ran dozens of simulated launches but I never noticed that wall before . - Simulated ? - Yeah , this is my first real launch . Great . Don 't stick your head out of the window . - She 's a little shaky . - Blood pressure 's gonna loosen her teeth . - Pulse is pushing 140 . - If she farts , she 'll get ahead of the pod . Fielding , listen to me . It helps to concentrate on something relaxing during a launch . What do you think about ? Not swallowing my tongue . - How 's Walker ? - Have to shake him to be sure he 's awake . - He 's awake . - T-minus-30 seconds 29 , 28 , 27 , 26 25 , 24 , 23 , 22 , 21 , 20 - - Have they ever lost a pod during a launch ? - Ask the Vollmers . - I 'll do that . Where are they ? - See those two red spots ? - twelve , 11 , 10 - Oh , God . - eight , seven , six , five four , three , two , one , zero . Ahhh ... They 're away . Is this the hottest thing or what ? Goddamn , Ricky . So much for a dry run . - We 're alive . - Are we where we 're supposed to be ? - Give me a date . " Sunday , October 9th , 1994 . " Target . - We 're close . - October 9th ? - I 'll be 16 tomorrow . - Where ? I was living in Colorado . Oh , man , this is weird . Oh , yeah ? Well , don 't get sentimental and try to visit yourself . I 'd kind of like to call myself and tell me not to sleep with Bobby Morgan after my party . It 's really disappointing . A smart woman would call Bobby and give him some advice . Oh , yeah , right . How long was Atwood your partner ? Three years . Was it difficult for you to bring him back ? What do you think ? Well , you got a family ? Mine 's still in Colorado . You know , my dad , when he started reading about time travel he said it was a bigger threat to the world than the nuclear bomb . He 's right . That 's why I joined the agency . The world should be able to party Saturday night , sleep in on Sunday and not worry whether or not the planet 's still gonna be here on Monday . - You sound like a woman I knew . - Someone remarkable , I hope . Yeah . Someone you knew , huh ? So where is she ? She was killed . Sorry . You must have thought about going back and changing that . We 're here . I thought it was just Parker Datalink . Take the back and wait for my call . Keep your head down . Tomorrow 's your birthday . McCOMB : I have a problem . You do ? McCOMB : Yes , I do . Let me tell you what my problem is . This isn 't working for me . I can 't keep paying for this . Hey , it doesn 't matter to me one way or the other . McCOMB : Oh , but it should , Jack . It should matter to you . Because you 're taking the goddamn company into bankruptcy . We have a difference of opinion . The chip is the future of this company . And since you don 't agree , walk away . This isn 't the first time we 've had this conversation . You come up with the money , and I 'm out of here . I really can 't afford it , and you know it . But I 've found an enterprising banker with faith in the future . Take it . You 're out . You 've got no faith in the company and I 've got none in politicians . If I were you , I wouldn 't cash that check . It 's gonna cost you more than you 'll ever know . Hey , Jack , it 's been a while . - What is this ? - It 's me . Well , it 's him . No , it 's us . Where did you come from ? Are you supposed to be his father ? Do I look that old ? Look , I 'm a United States senator . Hurting me is a federal offense . - I don 't know anything about Jack 's busi - - Will you stop it ? Just stop it , get a grip . I remember having bigger balls . I 'm gonna have to get this fixed . Wait . Don 't touch me . Same matter can 't occupy the same space . Same matter ? So you got a special NSA briefing coming up . A secret session . It 's not for another week . " Time travel , " someone says . Gets a big laugh . Oh , Christ , you 're me . How far back have you come ? Never interrupt me when I 'm talking to myself . - We 're gonna take them . - What 's the signal ? You were a visionary , Jack . The computer market was saturated , the software stocks were in the toilet and your fucking coldware revolutionizes the industry . I made a mistake . So I came back to tell you I changed my mind . Now . Freeze . Agent Walker , do you realize how inappropriate that word is ? - Do I look frozen to you ? - You look like shit to me . Get away from him . Move . Drop the guns now . Under your jacket , there 's a track-and-return module . Throw it to me . - You gonna leave me back here ? - Do it . Agent Walker , I wanna see how you get from up there to down here and keep the gun on us . What are you gonna do ? You gonna jump ? That 's how the Vollmers would do it . Move back . Give me the envelope . Thank you . Country 's down the drain because of the special interests . We need someone in the White House so rich he doesn 't have to listen to anybody . What 's that ? - The senator was having a fundraiser . McCOMB : When I 'm in office , it 's gonna be like the ' 80s again . Top 10 percent will get richer , other 90 percent can emigrate to Mexico where they can live a better life . So , Agent Walker , you 're going or staying ? I think you plan too far ahead . Obviously , you don 't . Anything else you want to tell me about yourself ? Don 't tell anyone I killed you . I 'm out on bail . Okay , let 's finish up and get out of here . - He 's running for president . I 'm voting early . - It 's good seeing you again , Jack . Maybe he 'll calm down after the election . What 's the big deal ? Point it , pull the trigger , and boom , somebody dies . Get up there ! Get the module . Fucking great . Will you get him ? Goddamn it . Aaron . Come here . You own the company , do you understand ? The chip is going to be worth billions , my billions . Now , read this . Oh-oh , oh . You just read it and do what it says . Now , you get out of here . And will you do me a favor ? Will you lay off the fucking candy bars ? Have a nice day . - I should have said freeze . - I think he got the idea . Do me a favor . Don 't give up without a fight . It never crossed my mind . - I don 't want to fight a woman . - Then don 't . I changed my mind . Tell me he 's gonna kill your family . - Don 't you leave me , goddamn it . - Who you talking to ? Stay here , Walker . In my future , you 're dead . Look at this . We got one DB right here . How about up there ? Let 's get a canine unit up here . How many you got ? I can check it , sir . No , don 't , stop . Let 's move . We get two guys up there . There 's one round back . What the hell 's going on here ? You 're lucky you got back . They 're getting ready to tear up these tracks . - McComb ? Who else ? He hasn 't got the power . You kidding ? He 's way ahead in all the polls . He 's probably buying running shoes for his transition team . Senate Committee caved in . They all wanna be on the good side of the new boss . What 's the matter ? It 's been headed this way for months . When I left , nothing had happened . Hey , Walker , when they tear up the launcher you get the pod as a memento . He 's changed the future . - What are you talking about ? McComb . - He 's buying the presidency . - So , what 's new ? It 's been done before . - The guy 's a killer . - Doesn 't surprise me . He killed my agency . - And he shot two people . - Who ? Who ? A guy named Parker and Fielding . - Do I know them ? - Fielding was with me . You sent her . I don 't like this guy one little bit , but who the hell do you think I can sell this story to without a smoking gun and about 50 eyewitnesses ? - How about one ? - You don 't count . There 's a chance she 's still alive . Who ? - Fielding . The cops were there . I 'm gonna be looking for a new government job next week . And I don 't think it 'll help if I 'm the guy that tried to put our next president in jail . - You think I 'm making this up ? - Forget it , you 're not going back . If she 's alive , we 've got him . You understand that ? We 've got the guy . We 're shut down . Take a look around , we 're history . Wait , I 'm gonna show you something . You come with me . Those files are supposed to be sealed . I don 't know why I 'm doing this . - You say you were my best friend ? For a long time . I liked you ? - Oh , yeah . What are you looking for ? Fielding 's friends or family , anyone she would go to in 1994 . - Who was she ? Internal Affairs . But she had a deal with McComb . He 's got to go back to be sure she 's dead . Since you say we were friends I 'm gonna ask you a question I 'm sure the prison psychiatrist will ask . How 's our leading presidential candidate making expeditions into the past without our equipment , old pal of mine ? The prototype was never dismantled . Kleindast 's . It 's in Calverton , Maryland . Short drive from Washington . - We have no authority to get in there . - What about Ricky ? If you were my best friend , you wouldn 't do this to me . McCOMB : I would 've had him killed here . But if he 's back , he 's already told the story to Matuzak . God knows who else . They won 't know what he 's talking about . But they 'll give it a lot of thought if he comes up dead . Right . - He 's gonna have to be erased . - Erased ? Yeah , have him killed before he joined T.E.C. That way , nobody in the agency ever talked to him or even knew him . - Perfect . - No , it 's not . It 's not perfect . But it 's all we 've got . Don 't expect to be my chief of staff if my slamming your face into the side of the car is gonna turn you into a sniveling worm . Well , what do you know ? Random intervals , Maryland Utilities show spikes in demand and duration that are almost identical to ours . - Send me back . No , they won 't let us do that . Stay out of it , Ricky . Would it be too much trouble to call me Richard ? Richard , do I have a best friend around here ? It isn 't me , maybe Gordon . Gordon is a putz .

Shoot me ? There 's a bomb that 's gonna go off any second . You know what happens then ? We 're all gonna be dead . And I 'm gonna win by default . My young self is still gonna be president and you can 't save your wife . Just like you couldn 't save her once before . She died because you came back and made some changes . So now you 're gonna fuck with time . - You 're as bad as me . - Wrong . I 'm setting it right . Usually , I hate doing things more than once . But in this case , I don 't see any other option . I do . What are you doing here ? What do you mean ? You called . You left a message with the senate operator . I didn 't leave any message , you idiot . Don 't argue among yourself . I left it .

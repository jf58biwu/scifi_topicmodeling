 [ Music playing ] [ Battle cry ] Die , barbarian pig . Leave this land and never return . Doran ? Doran , is that you ? Who goes there ? Be you friend or foe ? Show yourself , coward . Show yourself and do battle . [ Battle cry ] [ Man laughing ] The amulet , it is not protecting me from harm . It knows you are safe . Doran . You know nothing of honor . All is fair in love and in war , my sweet Doran . Now , the war is over . Our bond is strong , my beloved . I do love you . I , too , love thee . We shall always be together , for eternity . Doran , I 'm worried for our people . There 's so much evil and pain in the land . Thieves grow from every tree and every stream . The land is pure . It is the hearts of men that are evil . This amulet shall protect you from harm . Power and strength fill me . It is as if I , too , am a great warrior . Lystra , beware its power . The Wizard made this known to my grandfather . Perhaps this wizard is but a tale from your head . Wizards are not to be taken in jest , But be posessed of powers of the heavens and the underworld . Where is this wizard , then , and why does he Not show his face to me ? He shows his face to none , and he is a she , showing only Her face to those she chooses . A she ? My grandfather told me the story when I was a young boy . She appeared before his eyes to save him from certain death . He vowed never to lost sight of the amulet . And so it has been bequeathed to me . My vow is to use its power to protect my people , To teach them honesty and bravery , to seek the truth . And if this is done , then the people of Armana Shall be protected by its power . So you have done . They worship you , Doran . Worship is not what I seek , for I am not a god . All I ask is that they listen and follow . Their lives , then , are their own . You become wiser with each day . I am honored to be your queen . My grandfather gave me fair warning . And you , too , must beware its power , for with a thought One can travel great journeys to lands Never seen by thine eyes , a land where one may never return . So dream not of lands other than this , or you Shall leave me forever . The power shall make us great warriors . And with it , we shall build a new world for our children . [ Music playing ] [ Imitating bird sound ] Bartaga . Kiss me , great warrior . Kiss me . I have come to hunt with my king . I have no time for sexual foolishness . Doran , my friend , today is ripe for the hunt . And so your wine shall speak . She would make a great wife for a warrior For her bravery is more than most men possess . Bartaga is a warrior , not a lover . And I , my friend , am both . Perhaps the boar are better than a woman 's tongue . Yes , but what will keep you warm at night ? [ Inaudible ] hunter . [ Laughter ] And it does not screech in my ear . Oh . Oh . [ Magical twinkling ] Mandrak . Mandrak . I found a treasure , an amulet of great wealth . Oh . Where ? A woman holds it , a barbarian queen . Her name is Lystra . Lystra , the warrior 's woman ? He warned us never to return . We should go back . Where is she ? By the stream at the edge of the forest , not far . They 'll be sure to kill us if we go there . Coward . She 's very beautiful , Mandrak , a tasty Tidbit for a hungry man . She 's [ inaudible ] . He swore that if we ever came back ... Silence ! Take me to her . That amulet will make us all rich men . Ah , Lystra . If a man truly loves a woman , he will never leave her . But you must have a tree , for your man must leave to hunt Or you shall go hungry . You two speak with idle words . If I had a man like Doran , he could leave for years , And I would wait for him . But you do not have him , do you ? Only Lystra has that good fortune . There . [ Whispering ] Are you mad ? Silence , Wolf . You give me the women , or I 'll cut your tongues out . There are no men that I can see , just women and us . [ Quiet laughter ] Do thoughts of sadness fill your head ? It is nothing , my lady . Surely it is something , for I can see it in your eyes . I cannot hide from you . You see into my very soul . It is Bartaga . He does not even know that I am alive . A man such as Bartaga has a duty to himself Before he can be with a woman . He just needs to see the magic inside you that he is missing . You are right . I am worthy . It is he who has not opened his eyes . [ Laughter ] [ Yelling ] [ Screaming ] She 's only a woman . Come now , barbarian . You can do better than that . Now , die . Doran . Doran . Oh , my head . Nothing my wine cannot cure . Lystra , she 's in danger . Come on . The wife of the great warrior Doran , the mightiest barbarian Of them all . Ha ! Where is he now ? How shall he save you ? Will he even want you after I am finished with you ? You shall die by his sword . No , no . No . No . No . No . Doran ! Do you not like the touch of cold steel upon your cheek ? On your body ? Was it not as you expected , barbarian queen ? Mandrak , we must leave before Doran finds us , Or we 're doomed . Doomed ? I will show you doomed . Oh , I felt her spirit pass through me . It is as if I possess a new life . I have heard many wondrous tales , And now you will make me a rich man . Make us rich , Mandrak . Tell me more of the amulet 's powers . More ? Tell me . I must know , or you will die by my sword , jackal . It has the power of the heavens , Master , the spirits of the underworld , cursed strength . It is said that ... Do you take me for a fool ? No , Mandrak , no , it is the truth . You know as well as I. That crystal Protects Doran and his people . It could bring us a talent of gold coins . It will bring more than that , [ inaudible ] . It will bring me my salvation , what I have desired all my life ! No . No . No ! [ Lamenting ] Prisal . Prisal . Who did this to you ? Mandrak . Mandrak ? My prize of battle . They did not die without a fight . He ... he did this to my beloved . I 'll kill him with my bare hands . I swear , Doran . No . It is I who must avenge her death . I will not rest until Mandrak dies . I swear to you this . Your thoughts must be clear for battle . My thoughts were clear before you did that . Come , we have no time . Since my thoughts are clear , what of the amulet ? Did not the Wizard give your ancestors fair warning Never to lose sight of it ? You speak the truth . Will she not be a little angry ? It is I who lost the amulet . It is I who must have to pay . It was not you , my friend . It was Lystra who lost the amulet . Surely the Wizard will look upon this with a fair eye . I have no fear of death . A brave warrior , indeed ... Who , then , will I hunt with ? When the Wizard finds us , we may never hunt again . I will stand by your side , Wizard or no Wizard . [ Birds calling ] Birds , only birds . Come . We must not stop . [ Birds calling angrily ] [ Inaudible ] I have awaited this day , barbarian . You die . [ Battle cry ] [ Men shouting ] Stay back . No ! [ Crazy laughter ] [ Howling ] [ Laughter ] You are a brave one . What do they call you ? Doran . Doran . [ Laughter ] The King of Armana ? Were you lost in the forest like all of them ? He dies by my sword . Moltar would be pleased . Psst . Psst , barbarian . I know who you are . Caught you the same way they caught me , I wager . What are you doing in these parts ? I 'm searching for a murderer . Murderer ? Got plenty of ' em right here . Bloodthirsty vermin , they are . That one , watch out for him . He 'd just as soon rip the heart right out of you if you Look at him the wrong way . [ Men laughing and whooping ] Moltar , god of the underworld , I send to you this sacrifice Of flesh and blood . [ Cheering ] Tonight , you meet Moltar , and I have the honor . Strip him to the skin . [ Laughter ] Why do you look so surprised , barbarian ? Have you never seen a wizard before ? You are the Wizard ? I have heard only tales . You must hide before they see you . They cannot see me . Wizard , free me . Free you ? Why should I do that ? You are a healthy-looking mortal , aren 't you ? It is a pity , being captured by these heathens . Where is my crystal amulet ? I lost it . You lost it ? I saved your grandfather 's life . I gave him that amulet in the hopes that one day one ... one Man in this putrid land would ... Would set an example of honor . And all you can say is you lost it . That amulet was to protect his descendants for many lifetimes . You have broken the chain , Doran . So kill me now and be done with it . I do not deserve to live . Oh , you are quick to die , barbarian . To kill you would be too easy . To kill you would not replace my amulet , now would it ? It has been with me for centuries . Your from this day forward is to return the amulet to me . If you do not , then I shall be forced to curse your people . You leave my people out of this . If you fail to return it , then I Shall cast an evil and wicked plague over your tribe . They will burn with hatred and disease Upon hearing Doran 's name . This is not my people 's fault . Their wounds festering from their hate For their king ... oh , yes ! You will find the amulet . You will find the man that belongs To that hand on your belt . The man you seek is in this world No longer . You must travel to another time to find him . You must travel to a land called the future . It is very different than the forest . It is tomorrow 's tomorrow . But if you are quick of wit and brave of heart and fight With honor you may triumph . But you must return the amulet to me . Mandrak has the amulet , and it will make him a mighty warrior . The amulet has no power in the hands of evil , Doran . Only in the presence of honor and of a king With a noble heart does it have such magic . Behold . A sword . It will take you to your destination . And for the love of gods , do not lose it . Enough chatter . Be free , barbarian . And heed this as your last warning . Your evil shall end by my hands . Penny , please , when are you gonna listen to me ? I 'm telling you . You 're asking for trouble . Trust me on this . Brice , just chill out . Turn the camera on , and no matter What , just keep it rolling . Cogs will have a brick when he sees this .

 Original Subs : Uncredited Resync and Correction : Samizdata I need some fuel . I need some fuel . Propane or kerosene ? Kerosene . I only got a few liters left . Put the rest of the kero in the man 's scooter out there , Scratch . Ha ha ha ! Sick guy . It 's the ultraviolet . His noodle is fried . I can 't keep him out of the sun . You work for UNICOM , huh ? Yeah . How far is that station from here ? You got business with Old Man Hooks ? He loves you UNiboys . That 's about 40 Miles from here . Got any dried food ? I 'll take a look . Temperatures continue to rise throughout the Southwest . Some thermal squalls have been reported . The ozone depletion continues . UNICOM officials have reiterated the mandatory use of cool suits outside at all times . This just in ... Three more members of the Independent Liberty Union were arrested yesterday by Fresno Police . UNICOM officials said the ringleaders were using reconstructed computers to communicate with another like-minded group in the Midwest . This is the fifth time in as many months I.L.U. Members were arrested . UNICOM officials have asserted that all such dissident groups have been ferreted out and eradicated . You know , that 's not what 's really going on . I don 't care what the company says . This Liberty movement is getting stronger . Company officials have expressed to me privately they 're having one heck of a time ferreting out ... All I got is this snake jerky , huh ? No , thanks . How much for the kerosene ? Oh , make it 30 even . Thanks a lot . Mm-hmm . Keep cool , buckaroo . Huh ... huh . Sh-sure is ... Bitch-o machine you got here , man . You really ought to go inside . Why ? The ultraviolet . It 's burning you up . Why ? Are you Batman ? No . See you around , kid . See you around , kid . [ MOANING AND HEAVY BREATHING ] Well , my goodness . You actually look as if you 're enjoying this . He 's not minding it too much himself . If your mother was only to see this . This is like put another quarter in and take a ride . This is disgusting . How can you look at yourselves in the mirror ? Right , audience ? I feel just fine about myself . I provide a service for troubled and lonely men , and I 'm proud of it . I 'm healthy and clean and very good at what I do . Oh , honey , I bet you are . Time for another call . This is Winston Wicket . You are on the line . Hello . Hello . Is that really you , Winston ? Yeah , it 's really me , you desert dipshit . Turn your monitor down . Sorry . You certainly are sorry . What is it ? I just want to say I don 't think human prosties are worth a broke dick . And why is that , caller ? They ain 't as pretty as the synthoid prosties were . They ain 't as good , either . Hold on , now . What do you mean , not as ... good ? Let 's just say the synthoid prosties were more agile and cleaner , too . All them weird diseases came back when we had to use human whores . Winston ? Are you listening to me ? Lady , how exactly do you know how good you really are ? Is this some sort of assessment you took yourself ? I don 't have to be told how good I am . I know how good I am . Maybe you haven 't had a human for a long time . That 's a cheap shot . This show 's a cheap shot . Let me tell you something . Nobody talks to Winston Wicket like that . Young fella ? Is there something I can do for you ? Yeah . You , uh ... Lathan Hooks ? That 's me . Tyson Keen . From UNICOM . Well , you tell Big Brother , whatever it is , I ain 't interested . Big Brother just brought you 6 liters of freon . Listen , I 'm sick and tired of you UNICOM regionals coming out here whenever you got nothing better to do . Breathing down my neck , telling me how to run my business . Know what you ought to do ? Tell your bosses to worry less about what happens out here in the Wasteland and more about those big business shits in Washington . I 'm not breathing down anybody 's back . I 'm just making a buck . There are no bucks to be made out here , fella . I do need that stuff . Been out of backup so long , I forgot I ordered it . Like you forgot you promised me an audience and cameraman ? When will I get them ? When pigs fly , Winston . Get that stuff in here . Could you hold the camera a bit steadier ? We 're starting to look like an amateur hour . Whatever you say , your assholiness . Look , Arren , I need a bit of an advance . I promised these two bimbos dinner . Yeah ? What did they promise you ? You got a sick mind ... You little drip . What did you do to piss off my grandfather ? I said I worked for UNICOM . That 'll do it every time . You don 't look like a corporate geek . The company needed somebody who knows bikes . This job is not what I expected . After this , I 'm moving on . This place is like a museum . It 's an old power station . UNICOM fired everyone and left it to rot . Lathan did this . He did ? Yeah . Well , I modified a lot . I patched together some stuff from the junkyard outside . I 'd better get that freon . My name 's Arren . What 's yours ? Tyson . When it gets still like this , it means thermal 's going to hit . Stay until it passes . That would be two or three days . I wouldn 't want to overstay my welcome . Jesus Christ . Is that what I think ? It 's a DV-8 . Back when they really made them big . How did it get all the way out here ? The government scrapped them . When the Mexican uranium mines went dry , they just dumped them . There 's probably more out here . Really ? It must have been a sight to see this old guy in action . Long before I was born . Somebody 's been messing with the cortex . Oh ... me . I was trying to see if it was still operable . That 's against the law . So shoot me . Your parents got more like you ? No . My parents are dead . It 's just Lathan and me . I 'm sorry . So , how did you and the old man end up in the Wasteland ? It 's a long story . It can 't be that long . You 're not that old . I 'm 16 . And never been kissed . Maybe I 'll take you up on that offer and stay a while . Thanks . OK , that 's Lathan 's room over there , and that 's mine . Our handyman sleeps on the next floor down . Come on . I 'll show you . What else is on the third level ? There 's a kitchen and medical clinic . This place goes on forever . I want you to meet Quinn . He 's Lathan 's engineer and all-around handyman . You 'll probably be bunking with him . Good afternoon , boys and girls ... Hi , Quinn . Yesterday 's lesson on global economics . Um , open your textbooks to page ... I 'll show you where his room is . So , kids , the two primary causes of the last century 's economic catastrophe were ... Uncontrolled computer stock selling causing worldwide panic ... Who 's that ? Parice is the schoolteacher here . Correct . And the result was ... Cary , are you with us ? Yeah , I 'm here , teacher . Nine governments couldn 't pay their national debts , so UNICOM took over responsibility . Good . Right . And it can 't happen again because ... why ? Because , um ... Because UNICOM is a free enterprise bureaucracy dedicated to the concepts of life , liberty , and the pursuit of economic stability . Awful pretty for a schoolteacher . I guess . If you like the type . Take a look at chapter 4 , page 15 . Cary , go ahead and read aloud for us . So , Mr. Keen , where are you from originally ? Oceanside originally . My name 's Tyson . I 've never seen the ocean . I have . Do people still swim in it ? A few . Now and then . I 've always wondered what I 'd look like in one of those bikinis women used to wear . You wouldn 't catch me dead wearing one . 'Cause you 're not grown up enough to fill one out yet . Very funny , Quinn . Sorry I 'm late . Mr. Keen , my granddaughter says I owe you an apology . I suppose I do . You caught me at a bad time . You mean there 's a good time ? I 've been around a long time . I lived through the Days of Redemption . They say we 're redeemed now . Well , things could be worse . Mr. Keen , when UNICOM decided to ban the use of computers by civilians because , as they say , we screwed up the money markets , we triggered the econo-collapse . We bought that . We didn 't like it , but we bought it because it was the easiest thing to do . And when they outlawed robots because of some demented vision about the Book of Revelations , we thanked them for guiding us out of the darkness . Lathan . But nothing much has changed . Except we 've lost a couple of our civil rights . We 're still as uneducated as ever and self-absorbed . We 're still watching the same crap on television . No offense , Mr. Hooks , but the Winston Wicket show ain 't exactly brilliant programming . That jackass ' uncle holds the mortgage on this station . That 's why we have the Winston Wicket show on television . Even in absentia , I 'm the topic of conversation . What are you doing back here ? Motels were filled . With a thermal coming , we figured we 'd come back . Great . I promised these two fallen women a nice dinner . Sandra . Christie . Have everything you want . It 's on the house . We 've got to make up our own beds ! Parice , you 'll be bunking in my room . And , Winston , Lathan said you guys get the clinic . And don 't touch anything . I 'm not going to touch anything . Ha ha ha ha . Come on downstairs , girls . We 're going to play doctor . I 'll get the spare cot . Night , Arren . Night , Quinn . Good night . Sleep well . If you need anything , I 'm right here . Thanks , kid . He seems really nice . I guess . If you like the type . So how long you worked here ? About six months . That 's a tough old man . Yeah , he 's hard , but he 's fair . What did you do before this ? Odd jobs here and there . Same here . No matter what it is , as long as it pays . Good night . Good night . It 's all yours . Come on , ladies . This will be a night you will not forget for a long , long time . It 's a friggin ' hospital . I wonder what kind of mind-fuckers they got . Hey , Christie , come on . Remember what we agreed . OK ? Why is all this here ? It 's an emergency room for the desert shits . There a doctor here ? A UNiquack comes out regularly , shoots them up with medicine , and they 're good as new . [ CREAKING ] [ LOUD THUMP ] [ CLANG ] [ THUMPING ] [ BEEP BEEP ] [ FOOTSTEPS ] You scared the hell out of me . I was , uh ... I was just checking this ... Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! [ ALARM BLARES ] What is that ? Arren ! Shut up , you idiot ! [ ALARM BLARING ] What the hell 's going on ? Electricity 's out . Air 's down . Sensors warn when it 's over 105 . What the hell is that ? Juice is out , that 's all . Lathan 's not in his room . He 's probably been messing around again , shorted out the power source . Lathan . Lathan ! Maybe he 's in the trans room . I 'll go with you . Oh , this is great ... The old bastard has blown a fuse in the middle of a thermal , and we 're going to roast . Lathan . Lathan . Ah , there 's some major damage here . This isn 't good . Where the hell could he be ? Aah ! Arren ! They killed him ! They killed him ! Arren ! They killed him ! It wasn 't an accident ! Listen to me . No , they killed him ! It 's OK . It 's all right . I know . It 's OK , sweetheart . It 's all right . It 's OK . What happened ? I don 't know . Must 've slipped off the catwalk . Could 've been a heart attack . How 's the kid ? She 's pretty shook up . Well , this is a fine kettle of snatch . We 're going to be roasting in this furnace . You 're an asshole . Leave your hands off me . You 're worried about the heat ? That 's not going to make it any cooler in here . If the thermal continues and we can 't get the spark on , we 'll fry . It 's 110 degrees now , and it 's going to get much hotter when the sun rises . What about auxiliary power ? We 've got about an hour left . Why don 't you do something out of the ordinary ? Do what you 're paid for . Why don 't you just fix it , huh ? So , can we fix it ? Maybe . We could try to rig a power bypass , but we got to go outside to do it . How is she ? As well as expected . She says the old man was murdered . She 's in shock . I gave her something to help her sleep . We 're going to rig a power bypass . In the meantime , maybe you can find some kerosene lanterns . Better suit up . He didn 't fall . He was jamming their signal . They killed him . What ? Don 't let them get away with it . Arren , who ? UNICOM . Arren . Is she all right ? Yeah . Quinn 's waiting for you outside . Oh . Be careful , OK ? I will . Don 't touch anything in here . Hold the light steady . No water . Why not ? The pump 's electric . If this thermal continues , we 'll die without water . You mean to tell me there are no emergency supplies ? Damn fool . There 's got to be something here . Christie , check the cupboards for soups , any other kind of liquids . Toilets ! Good idea . OK . Winston . That 's your job . What ? Oh , come on . Don 't tell me you never drank from a toilet . You 're a well-rounded guy . OK , if you 're going to be a spoilsport , we 'll boil it , OK ? Yeah , boil this . How much longer ? I almost got it . Lord , I have just looked into the abyss . At least the last son of a bitch flushed . What is all this ? [ FAUCET RUNNING ] Oh , here 's to big strong men . I must 've inhaled a pound of sand . Is there anything I can do for you ? Uh ... I 'm OK . Well , is everything fixed ? Yeah , until the thermal passes . We have to rewire the whole thing . I just looked in on the kid , to see if she 's OK . She wasn 't there . I looked everywhere . She 's gone . Arren ? She 's not there . You OK ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm OK . Come on . I 'll help find her . This place is starting to give me the willies . Relax . It 's a lot better than some of the places we 've been in . There 's something weird going on . I can feel it . Soon as the thermal passes , we 'll head up to Frisco . What about the money Mr. Wicket owes us ? That fat fucker 's a deadbeat . I say we cut our losses and kiss his ass goodbye . He said he was going to make me a TV star . Come on . Let 's go find the kid . Arren ? Arren ? You down here ? Arren ? Arren ? Oh , come on , you little twit . This ain 't funny . Arren ? Come on , baby . Arren , don 't do this . Come on . If you 're in here , let me know . Arren ? Come on , honey . Aah ! Why did you sneak up on me ? What are you doing here ? I need a drink . I need a drink . Shh ! Follow me . I want to show you something . Where did all this stuff come from ? Lathan did it during the Days of Redemption . It 's all stuff from the nineties . What do you guys use it for ? Ah ! Ow ! Jesus , what the hell are you doing ? Oh , God , I 'm sorry . I had to see if you were a synth . Are you nuts ? The synths were destroyed years ago . No , UNICOM 's been using them for over a year . Lathan and the others found out when one infiltrated the group . Wait . What ? What group ? The Independent Liberty Union . Your grandfather belonged to the I.L.U. ? So what do they use synthoids for ? Watchdogs . To watch ... Us . They 're programming them on a UHF frequency . Lathan found a way to jam the signal . It was only a matter of time before they traced it and sent a rubber geek to stop it . That 's why they killed him . At first , I thought it was you , but Lathan said you were harmless . What we didn 't figure on was one already being here . Yeah , but Arren , by international agreement , synthoids are programmed to be incapable of killing humans . Any synth can kill you if you override its fail-safe program with a crash and burn virus . That 's what they were broadcasting . When I came down here , there was all sorts of stuff happening on the screen . It was the virus programmed just before Lathan was killed . [ COMPUTER BEEPING ] There . That 's the synthoid 's I.D. Number . That 's us . That 's the crash and burn virus . And that 's my grandfather 's social security number . So what 's F.L.R. 101 ? First Law of Robotics . Deleting it . Creating a killing machine . Tyson , I 'm sorry I cut you . I guess I knew you weren 't a synth . There 's things that don 't add up here , though . What about that room and all the emergency supplies stashed where nobody can get them ? Someone must 've moved them there . What about the freon ? There 's 10 liters there . Your grandpa said you 'd been out for months . One of us ain 't one of us . I 'm going to find out which one . This is the craziest thing I 've ever heard . I saw the computer . All that means is that little shit 's going to jail as soon as they find out . This whole thing 's absurd . Why ? I mean , anything 's possible . Well , we all know each other . Except them . And me . I saw him bleed . Can we just get on with this , please ? Besides , what difference does it make if one of us isn 't real ? Exactly . If a synthoid did kill the old man , it got what it wanted . Why would we still be targets ? What if it 's programmed to kill anything it sees as a threat ? We all know it 's here . It 's probably enough . Well , you all deserve to know for yourselves . I 'll go first . You 're getting better at that , kid . I 'll go next . Piece of cake . Who 's next ? I got nothing to lose . I 'll go next . If I can 't trust you , who can I ? I 'll do it . Is that red enough for you ? I need another drink before you play doctor . Why must it be this way ? I mean ... Ladies first . Aah ! Fuck ! Jesus Christ ! Quinn , you asshole ! You think everything 's a joke . Jesus ! I guess that leaves me . I told you this was a crazy idea . You ought to be locked up , you little cretin ! All this I.L.U. bullshit ! She 's as crazy as the old man ! For Christ 's sake , she just lost her grandfather . So it 's OK to slice and dice me ? Jesus , look at this . It 's already starting to swell up . Son of a bitch , you infected me ! When this thermal 's over , I 'm going to call the Rangers and tell them where they can find an illegal computer . Little girls like you go over well in prison . It 's all right , kid . We all make mistakes . Well , it 's after 2 : 00 . I 'm going to get some sleep . See you in the morning . I 'm having some tea . Anybody want to join me ? Yeah , I 'm going to stay up a little while . Good night . Well , I 'm going to bed . I 'll be in Lathan 's room . It 's more secure . I don 't know . I just ... Can 't picture Lathan in the I.L.U. He liked to think of himself as a revolutionary , but he was really more of a dreamer than a doer . Whiskey ? No . No , thanks . What about the computer ? That was a surprise . The Rangers will have to figure that one out . So why do you live in this Wasteland ? The same reason most people do , I guess . Everything went under glass when the ocean air got toxic , and even with these thermals , I couldn 't live that way . Yeah . It 's a hell of a world we live in . Yeah . What ? What 's wrong ? It 's just been a long time since someone held me . Jesus Christ , look at this thing . Ow . Jesus Christ . Ow ! Fuck ! Jesus . They finally got to you . Good boy . Don 't let them figure you out . [ FOOTSTEPS ] Tyson ? Tyson ? Tyson , is that you ? [ FOOTSTEPS RECEDING ] Hi . Aah ! Quinn ! Let her go . I can snap her neck like a twig . You do , and I 'll blow your fucking microchips all over this floor . Suit yourself . Ow . Aah ! Where are you going ? I got to thank you , kid . You said a synth would try to destroy anything it thought threatened it . I wasn 't programmed for that . They just told me to get the old man , but as soon as you said it , I saw the sense in the idea . You see , there 's a teeny tiny little chip in my big gargantuan brain . The company calls it the Jiminy factor ... 'cause it 's like a conscience . It 's kind of cute , huh ? But I would never in a million , billion , trillion years terminate a human . But thanks to a miracle of modern technology ... Poor little Jiminy cricket ... Has crashed ... [ STOMP ] ... and burned . So now there 's only one mission left to protect the company 's synthoid program from any outside interference . And you two with your Goddamn questions and unpatriotic opinions have definitely interfered . So ... We 're going to have some fun . How about a little hide and seek ? Tyson , how did you know it was Quinn ? The cut on Wicket 's hand swelled up way too fast . Coolant 's lethal in the blood . Quinn slashed him right after he used it . That hidden coolant ? That 's his blood supply . We got to get the others and get out . Are there any more guns ? Yeah , the I.L.U. gave Lathan some . I know where it is . We should stick together . I can watch out for myself , now that I know what I 'm watching out for . Where 'd you get that ? Quinn tried to kill us . Tyson 's waiting for you in the studio . I 'll get the others . Sandra ! Sandra ... the synth ... It 's Quinn . Where 's Winston and Christie ? I don 't know . Get to the studio . I 'll find them . Watch out for Quinn . That 's an ugly sore you got there . You scared me shitless , sneaking up like that . Someone should take a look at that . This thing 's making me scared . It started as a small cut . I never seen anything this Goddamn infected . You think you got problems . Take a look at this . Jesus Christ . Where you going , fat boy ? I thought we 'd whip up a batch of cookies . That ... that ... that ... That 's all , folks ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh-oh . It 's way too late for a doctor . Quinn ! Uh ! Uh ! I think we 'd better amputate . Aah ! You know , stumps ? Your friend did me a favor when he shot up my circuits . He improved something . Know what that is ? My sense of fun ! Ohh . He got Winston . What ? Christ . Sandra , I couldn 't find her . Hey , but maybe that means he won 't either . [ COCKS GUN ] Guess who . Well , your hands aren 't as large as Winston 's . Say something else . What do you want me to say ? Tell me that you like me . I like you , Christie . Don 't look . Keep your eyes closed . Ahh , ahh ... Ahh . Ahh . Aah ! Oh , my God ! Oh , God ! Aah ! What do we do if we get him ? Try to get broadcast power back up . Let the world know what 's going on down here . It 's not just here . Well , maybe we should contact UNICOM . Why can 't you see where that would get us ? You 're supposed to be the smart one here . Take it easy , all right ? Shit . He just wants to play with us . We 'll be OK if we hold him off till morning . Then Christie and I are out of here . Aah ! Aah ! Ohh ... You guys ... Take Christie with you . And tell her I said goodbye . I stopped at a roadside 40 Miles east of here . Is that the closest place ? Those heaps outside still run ? Let 's get Christie and get out of here . The heat will kill us by noon . So we 'll have to do it before then . You got a photocam here ? Lathan had one . Get it . Get some pictures of that thing , then meet us outside . All right ? Let 's go . Come on , Arren . Let 's go . Here . [ ENGINE FALTERS ] Come on . Come on ! [ ENGINE STARTS ] Hang on . What 's the rush ? Aah ! Arren ! Watch out ! Watch out ! Aah ! Aah ! [ THUNDER ] Tyson , look out ! Tyson ! Tyson ! Tyson ! Tyson ! Tyson ! Arren ! Oh , my God . Tyson ! Uh ... uhh . Uhh ... Uhh . Tyson , we 'll get you out . What will you do ? Resurrect the dead . Help me with this . I 'll get the DV-8 going . Lathan made a circuit unit for my computer . But the electricity 's out . The power pack will get the main frame going . It took months of training to walk a DV-8 . I 've been training . Don 't worry , Tyson . We 'll get you out . Come on . Get up . Uh ! Damn it . Aargh ! Ah ! Sorry , old fella . Let 's see . Oh , man ... That 's going to need some stitches . Let 's find Arren and get out of here . OK . Arren ! Something 's not right . Where the hell is she ? Arren ? Arren ? Don 't you want to kiss me just one last time ? Hey ! Kiss this . [ SIREN ] Ha ha ! Hey . Wonder what the hell they 're up to . Probably some pileup on the interstate . See you around , Scratch . Where y 'all headed ? Dateland . Lathan wants me to pick him up something . Ah ? How 's that old renegade ? Better than ever these days . Be seeing you , Bud . Take care . I guess they figured out that their electronic flunkies got terminated . Yeah . So where now ? You know where I.L.U. Headquarters is ? Yeah . Bakersfield . OK . I 'll get them those pictures of the synthoids you shot . You can help them set up broadcast facilities . UNICOM 's word won 't be worth shit . Is there another way to get to Bakersfield besides the main highway ? There 's a dirt turnoff about a half mile up . Comes out just this side of Long Pine . You all right ? Yeah . I 'm just thinking about Lathan . Guess I 'm a little scared . You 're not the only one . I just wish he could have seen that old rust bucket walk . He would 've been proud . You kind of liked her , didn 't you ? Well , she was only going to break your heart right after she ripped it out . Captions copyright © 1990 Full Moon Entertainment

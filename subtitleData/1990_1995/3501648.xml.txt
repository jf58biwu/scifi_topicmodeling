Was it an alien abduction , spontaneous combustion ? What knows ? One thing 's for certain- - the legend of Thrash will live forever . You hear that , big guy ? I 'm a legend . I 'm bigger than Elvis . It 's everything I 've always wanted . Remember- - if the world knows Thrash is alive - you stop being a legend . - Nothing to worry about . No one 's ever noticed me . I 'm invisible . Here 's to invisibility . Oooh ! [ Giggling ] Don 't tell me Dick 's got his guitar with him again . Nope- - whole new approach .

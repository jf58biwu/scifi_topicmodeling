 We 've lost gravity ! We are betrayed ! Restoring auxiliary gravity . Attack them now , while we still can ! Attack or be slaves in their world . We can take whole by force , what they propose to divide . War is obsolete , General , as we are in danger of becoming . Better to die on our feet than live on our knees . That wasn 't what my father wanted . Again ! Again ! This is listening post Morska . What ship is that ? Over . We am thy freighter ... Ursva . Six weeks out of Kronos . We is condemning food things and supplies . Don 't catch any bugs ! They were beamed aboard a Federation starship . I could trace ... Escaped . Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference . Are you sure ? Will you take that chance ? Helmsman , make course to intercept Enterprise . What 's she doing ? Protect the Chancellor !

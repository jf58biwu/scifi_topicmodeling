 Oh , my ... God . That was ... that was incredible . I mean it . You don 't believe me . Can you hear me ? Hey , I ... I don 't even know your name . New York businessman calls his wife to say good night , then goes out , picks up some chippie , brings her back here for sex . Beyond that , well , nothing makes a whole lot of sense . How 's that ? Security monitor records the victim entering the room with a woman at 10 : 13 . Same monitor records a male leaving just after midnight . Couldn 't she have changed clothes ? Thought of that . Male is definitely a different person ... short hair and at least 30 pounds heavier . The video never recorded his entry nor the chippie ever leaving . Well , we 're 30 floors up . No other means of egress . Did the medical examiner establish a cause of death ? Guy blew an artery . Must have been some roll in the hay . It 's hard to imagine , in this day and age , someone having sex with a perfect stranger . Any sign of robbery ? The male exited wearing the victim 's suit , carrying a suitcase , and the wallet 's gone . You know , I don 't even know why we got this call . Really ? Somebody at the Bureau put out a memo requesting any case involving this exact C.O.D. I assumed it was a ... Thanks for the call . Five deaths , four in the last six weeks between here and Boston . In each case the victim dies in the throes of passion . Two women and three men , including the last one . All young , healthy adults . All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest . You think there 's a new drug on the streets ? The oldest drug ... not even illegal . Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones . The chemicals animals secrete ? You mean sexual attractants ? Radar love , only about a hundred times stronger than found anywhere in nature . Strong enough to produce anaphylactic shock or a coronary . So you think somebody is synthesizing them ? It 's been done , but in nowhere near these concentrations , and hold on to your hat , Scully , 'cause you 're going to love this . The pheromones we 're talking about ? They contain human DNA . Well , there 's still a question as to whether humans can produce pheromones , so how can that be ? I don 't know , but if it 's true , this guy 's a walking aphrodisiac . He 's the ultimate sex magnet . He or she ? You 've got victims of both sexes . Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor . I know , that is a puzzle . So , what is our profile of the killer ? Indeterminate in height , weight , sex . Unarmed but extremely attractive . It gets weirder . As I said , there 's been four deaths matching this M.O. in the last six weeks . In Boston , Hartford , Philadelphia , and here in Washington . The killer 's moving south . There was a death I made a note of about a year ago with the same symptoms . A 32-year-old U.M.W. labor organizer was found dead outside a town called Steveston in the woods of Massachusetts , home to a sect of religious isolationists called the Kindred . Right . They live up there without electricity , phones , any modern amenities ... a lot like the Amish . The Kindred are known for their handmade stoneware pottery . They mine the clay themselves in the local hills . What 's so weird about that ? The white clay in those hills is particular to that region . It 's also the same substance I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim 's side . Wait a minute . Aren 't these people famous for their abstinence and their pure Christian ways ? Yes , but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to clean under his fingernails . I 'll meet you at the market . Hi . Excuse me , ma 'am , this is Federal Agent Scully . I 'm Agent Mulder . We 're investigating a possible murder . Well , there aren 't many killings around here . What can you tell me about the Kindred ? They keep pretty much to themselves , huh ? Yeah , some folks say it 's ' cause they 're doing ceremonies up there ... voodoo or something . I 've got nothing against them myself . They bring in the tourists . Did the Kindred let you take those pictures ? Oh , those ... those are from back in the ' 30s . What about the missing ones ? I 'm having them reframed . They 're right here under the counter . Can I take a look at ' em ? Sure . How would I get up to see them ? Well , they don 't like strangers up there much . The road 's in pretty rough shape . Steveston . That 's them now . They usually shop at the feed store . Whoa , boy . Excuse me , ladies . I think I 'm going to go inside . You need anything from the feed store ? Hi . She must have problems on the asphalt . Has she ever thrown a shoe ? What 's her name ? Alice . That 's sweet . Did you name her ? We named her all together . I 'm not allowed to talk outside . That 's all right . I 'm Dana Scully . I don 't mean you any harm . Brother Andrew . Scully , what are you doing ? I was just talking . You all right ? Yeah . I think so . You want to sit down ? Interesting way of life . You get any sense about ' em ? There 's something up there , Mulder . Ooh , I 've been saying that for years . Oh , for a four-wheel drive . Looks like about a mile walk . After you . Now ... this ... that 's west . What does the map say ? That we should be there already . Mulder , look . Hmm ? We 're FBI agents , federal police . I 'm Agent Mulder , this is Agent Scully . We 're here to investigate a murder . I 'm going to have to ask you to remain at a distance . Please , sir . Your weapons are forbidden here . We can outlast you at this spot . You 're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed to our council . You will have them again as you leave . We can 't do that . Please . I 'm Sister Abby . This is Brother Oakley . We are all saddened by what has happened in your world , but it does not concern us . Up here , no one kills another , ever . We just want to have a few questions answered . It is your weapons that are unwelcome here , not you . Come and pray with us , be one of us , and you 'll see that we harm no one . Please relinquish your weapons . Please . Now there is no reason to be afraid . Come ... sit . Let us pray as one . We who are separate give thanks for our allotted time on this world . We ask for strength that we may bring forth the bounty that God has provided . Amen . We pray for the day of the coming , the moment of our release . Amen . Let us eat . I was wondering if we might ask a few questions . We 're looking for someone we believe may have come from here . We have pictures . We do not allow pictures . A crime has been committed . We have certain questions that we need answered if you 'll forgive us . What are these pictures ? Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have committed a murder . Where was this crime committed ? In a hotel in Washington , D.C. If we can arrange for you to look at the videotape , maybe you can identify the individual . How much violence has this person caused in your world ? Five murders so far . And may kill again , which is why we need your help . Has anyone left recently ? Your world does not interest us . We have no need for your violence or your questions . I 've said what is needed . They have no right to be here at this time . Brother Wilton , stand . Before we can accept any man 's person , we must accept our own . And I ask who can stand in your sight when once you are angry ? I am ashamed to lift up my face and I shall not be ashamed in this evil time . Make atonements for this wrath , Brother Wilton . That 's all right . We didn 't take any offense . Anger , as violence , is not tolerated . Our brother must be admonished . He can 't breathe . He does not need your help . He 's choking to death . Remove Brother Aaron from the dining hall . We did not invite you here to interfere . We take care of our own . Would you like to dance ? Not right now . Look , I 'm really not interested , okay ? Just one dance . Yeah . One dance . It 's a mile to your car . Stay on the path . Thanks for your cooperation . The Addams Family finds religion . Take me back to the 20th century . You believe all that back there , Scully ? Believe all what ? All that " we take care of our own " business ? Well , they 'd better take care of their own , or that man at the dinner table is a dead man . I think it was all an elaborate act . What , the choking ? No , all this simple life " living from abundance " crap . These people know something , Scully . You can see it in their eyes ... the way they look at one another . Do you think they know who the murderer is ? Did you notice how they managed not to answer a single question of ours ? And that outburst at the table was right on cue . Somehow they got us to answer their questions . Did you ask yourself why there weren 't any children around ? I know , that was odd . You want to know what 's really odd ? You know those pictures we saw down in the store in Steveston today , the ones from the ' 30s ? I swear I saw some of those same faces at the dinner table tonight . These people have probably been intermarrying for years . Maybe . Maybe not everything is as black and white as it appears to be . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna go back for a little look-see . Maybe they went to the movies . You hear that ? Uh-huh . What do you think ? I think I want to see what 's in that cellar . Come with me . I can give you information . I know who did it . The murders ? You 've heard our prayers . You 've seen how we live our beliefs . I want you to find this killer . I want you to find him for me . He was my best friend . What 's his name ? Brother Martin . I called him Marty . Marty was different . What do you mean , different ? How does he kill ? We 're not sure . All of the victims died of cardiac arrest . He poisons them , doesn 't he ? Maybe . How do you know that ? I need to show you something . Something about Marty . We found them out on Route 44 . We were wandering . Marty and I used to do that . Explore the edges of our world . Somebody must have left them for garbage . They are garbage . Why did you keep them ? It was Martin who kept them . Some of what I saw in the magazines ... some of it was beautiful , but most of it I didn 't like . It was garish , but Martin ... Marty , he couldn 't get enough . He liked even the paper it was printed on ... slick . Marty was captured by your world . He left us to become one of you . Brother Wilton . The woman has returned . Where is she ? With Andrew in the main house . What about the other one ? He 's missing . You said Marty was different . Yes . How ? How did he kill his victims ? I could be banished . Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the barn tonight ? What are you doing ? Scully . Marty is different . We 're all different . Oh . No . Scully . Get off of her . I asked you not to interfere . What the hell were you doing back there ? I don 't know . - You don 't know ? - No . Are you all right ? I wasn 't ignoring you . No . Of course I saw you . I just ... I didn 't recognize you . That 's all . Excuse me . I 'm on a conversation . Sorry . No . Uh-huh . Thanks . How you feeling ? Better . A little embarrassed , actually . Why ? You don 't remember any of it . It 's like I don 't remember ... Why didn 't you get out of there before he ... ? Because he told me he knew who the killer was . How did you know he wasn 't the killer ? I believed him . So , what did you see down in the cellar ? Just Brother What 's-His-Name buried in some gopher hole in the wall ... buried alive . How do you know he was alive ? Because I was in there with him , and his face was , was different . Even his hair ... it was almost feminine . It was like he was going through some kind of a transformation . Changing sexes ? That would explain the hotel security video . So you 're saying these people ... I know what I saw , Scully , and I saw you about to do the wild thing with some stranger . Think he was trying to kill me ? Maybe it 's the sex that kills . Well , if he was trying to kill me , why did they let us go ? I don 't know . All right , let 's break it up . Out of the car . Sorry , Officer . You , too . You a pro ? Pro ? What ? On a scale of one to ten , she was a kind three . But there was something about her . Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other manner ? Her touch was ... electric . But after that I remember ... only vaguely . What do you remember ? Nothing , actually . Try to remember , Michel . The policeman at the scene supports what you said . But maybe there was something unusual about this woman ... something you wouldn 't feel comfortable telling the police on the record . But this is off the record ? - Absolutely . - What did you see , Michel ? After she left the car , when she was fighting with the cop , I saw her in her clothes and she looked like a ... She looked like a man . She was a man . Hustling in the club scene used to be so simple . It 's off the record ? Scout 's honor . We can 't rule out the possibility that what we 're looking for is a transvestite . I think Don Juan in there knows the difference between the male and the female of the species . I just don 't want us to ignore the obvious . I mean , how else could you explain a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop ? She was a he . Agent Mulder , Agent Scully , the credit card that was stolen from the last victim in D.C. was just used to order takeout in a hotel downtown , about eight blocks from here . It was always forbidden . But after the first time , I couldn 't help myself . Touching a human man or a woman ... is as powerful for me as it was for you . This is Agent Scully requesting police backup and additional agents at 771 Catherine Street ... it 's the Hotel Catherine . Your world offers pleasures ... pleasures we don 't know because we 're different . But you know that now . The others will punish me for what I 've done . They 'll find me because the day is coming , and they won 't leave without me . Mulder . Delivery . FBI ! FBI ! Clear ! Stay down ! Got a body ! Scully ? I 'm okay . Scully , down the stairs . Federal agent ! I 'm armed ! Back away ! Step away ! Step away . Please ... don 't hurt him . No . Step away . I 'm armed . Scully ! The surrounding ten blocks have been secured for the past hour . We set up roadblocks on all the routes out to Steveston . So far nothing , no reports of them . There 's no way they could have gotten through . What if they did get through ? There 's only one place they 'd hide . They 're gone . We found something in the hay field . I don 't understand . How can they just disappear ? They have no means of transportation . No earthly means of transportation .

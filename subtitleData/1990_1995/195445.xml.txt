 Hello , there 's- - There 's a baby here . There must be a mother . Hello ! There 's a baby ! Help ! Hello ? is anybody here ? Miscarriage-prone female reproductive system is merely an extension ... of the body 's natural and necessary instincts to reject foreign matter . Just two drops . The body mistakenly identifies the embryo ... as an unwanted foreign substance ... and creates antibodies to fight and reject it . From this equation comes the idea for the drug , Expectane ... which acts to neutralize the interfering antibodies ... and promote successful embryo attachment . Minnie here had a history of miscarriages . As a result of our treatments ... she 's now in her seventh month of pregnancy . She takes 10 cc 's of Expectane three times a day . - Hey , Keith . - Good morning . - Ned . - Larry . Hey , big day . - Are you nervous ? - F.D.A. ? Piece of cake . - Sign those plan documents , will ya ? - All right . Hello , Louise . Hello , everybody . Mrs. Parrish is in one for a second trimester sonogram . You have an initial consultation with the Lanzarottas ... and Mrs. Logan 's here for a final . Okay . Bagel , please . Thank you . - Hello . - Oh , Doctor . - l 'm ready to explode . - Oh , not here , you 're not . - Perfect . Just one more month . - Yes . - Get new blood and urine samples . - Blood and urine samples . Dr. Hesse , good luck with the F.D.A. Luck is for the ill-prepared . - Car 's waiting out front . - Thank you . I had them check the traffic reports . And the big dweeb ? He and Mr. Banes will meet you downtown . Good luck . In testing the drug on chimpanzees with a history of miscarriages ... I found conclusively that in every instance the side effects observed ... were consistent with the behavioral and metabolic changes in subjects ... with normal unmedicated pregnancies : nausea , mood swings , appetite fluctuation , irritability , morning- - Typical lambchop 's-got-a-bun-in-the-oven type behavior . This drug works . Madam Chairperson , ladies and gentlemen ... we respectfully request the Board 's approval ... to carry on into an invasive human protocol . Thank you . You got to let us try this on real women . Women in need . Our sisters . - Our daughters- - - Dr. Arbogast . If you could see the couples that come into my office . - Their pain and frustration is genuine . - Dr. Arbogast . Ma 'am ? This is an F.D.A. hearing , not a telethon . We have all the information we need . Thank you . As director of Leland University 's Biotechnology Research Program ... I thank you on behalf of my esteemed colleagues for your consideration . Let 's go , gentlemen . - Thank you very much . - Thank you . That went pretty good , huh ? I 'm sure you 'll be very comfortable here . We have all the latest videocassettes , the current magazines . Uh , give it to Louise when you 're finished . I 'm sure you 'll be very comfortable . Just relax and enjoy it . That 's the ticket . Dr. Arbogast ? Your wife- - l 'm sorry , your ex-wife 's in your office . - She says she needs to talk to you . - What ? - Yeah. ln there . - ln- - You 're doing great . See you in a month . How ya doin ' ? - Oh , hi . - Angela , what are you doin ' here ? Larry , I 've got something really important to talk to you about . - You might wanna sit down . - l 'm busy , Angela . I 'm pregnant , Larry . Really ? Well , that 's- - That 's wonderful . How long ? Oh , seven weeks , give or take . The Kelman wedding . The night of the Kelman wedding . - Yeah , that 's the only time we did it- - - No . He was in and out of my life very quickly . Not quickly enough , apparently . - He who ? - lt 's not important . You sure it 's not mine ? Larry , come on . After all the years we tried ... I don 't think it 's going to happen one night by accident . Thought maybe one of mine could have bribed his way in or something . So , what do you want from me , Angela ? I want you to be my doctor . Thank you very much , Angela , but l- - Even if I wanted to , I couldn 't . We 're related . - Not since the divorce . - Dr. Arbogast . - Dr. Arbogast . - ln a minute ! No . That 's final . I 'll ask Ned if he 's got any room . If there 's anybody better than me , it 's Ned . I 'm sorry . Noah Banes is on one . He says it 's important . Ned Sneller ? Forget it . He looks at me , Larry . Banes. I 'm on my way . Banes. I 'm on my way . All right , gentlemen . What seems to be the trouble ? They 've jammed the lock . Dr. Hesse ? Dr. Hesse ? This is totally unacceptable behavior . - Open this door , now . - l will miss you most of all . Pop the hinges . Banes . What 's going on ? Dr. Arbogast , good news and bad news , I 'm afraid . F.D.A. decision , wicked bad news . - They turned us down ? - l 'm afraid so . And the review board has terminated your project . I 'm sorry , but you know , lab space is tight , and money 's even tighter . - They canceled the project . - Please , Banes . I got 300 grand in this drug . You got to cut me some slack . Would that I could , but it 's out of my hands . Blame the review board . You 're head of the board . Yes , I am . Rock and a hard place . So what 's the good news ? Well- - l really hate to dance on your grave . But I landed Dr. Diana Reddin and her ovum cryogenics project . I need you to be extremely careful with this . - Lady , if I hear that one more time- - - They 're very fragile . I 've just got to set the level for the incliners . - Hey , don 't touch that ! - You shouldn 't be up there ! Stop ! No ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me now ! - Oh ! My babies ! - Out of the way ! Thank you . Thank you . That 's not necessary- - Get off me . Sorry . Thank you so very much . Leave me alone . - Dr. Reddin ? Are you all right ? - Yes . I 'm fine . Thank you . - No harm done . - No . Are they- - Okay , let me just check these . Thank God . They 're all right . They 're all right . Frozen eggs , huh ? Yes. I call it the dairy section . If it weren 't for the lightning reflexes of- - Where is he ? He 's gone . - Hesse ! - Dr. Hesse has left the building . Wait. lt 's his- - lt 's his laboratory , isn 't it ? - Was . - You like it ? Yes . But I don 't want to displace anybody . Oh , you won 't be , I promise . Take the chimps back to the primate lab . We won 't be needing them anymore . Where ya goin ' ? I 'm going back to Europe to start over . You 're running out on me ? I don 't believe this . What are you doin ' ? We 're partners . You can 't just up and leave . We 're not partners anymore. I have no lab , no funding , no future here . Wait a minute . What about all the people you 'd be leaving behind ? What about your girlfriend ? What 's her name again ? - l don 't have a girlfriend . - You 're better off . How about your colleagues ? I happen to know for a fact ... that your skill and dedication is an inspiration to everybody . They 'd be lost without you . They will find someone else to mimic over coffee in the lounge . That 's not true . They don 't do that . - Come on . - l 'm not well liked . - l like ya . - No , you don 't . I talked to my guy at Lyndon Pharmaceutical , that Canadian firm . - Larry . Good-bye . - They 'll give us additional funding ... provided we find a volunteer for an Expectane protocol . Can 't do the protocol without F.D.A. approval . We can if we don 't tell the F.D.A. Are we going to let a bunch of Washington bureaucrats ... stand in the way of progress ? What woman will take an unapproved drug while she 's pregnant ? Who says we need a woman ? What are you talking about ? The experiment wouldn 't have to identify the subject 's sex . Just the human tissue reactives . Remember Moe ? The monkey ? He went five months to term . - You mean to do the test on a man ? - Why not ? Are you allergic to anything ? To me ? You 're nuts . Boarding pass . - Boarding pass ? - l don 't have a boarding pass . Only ticketed passengers with boarding passes beyond this point . Hear me out ! Sir , I need your ticket . - Gate 68B to Paris . - Quick . Thank you very much . Pardon me . Excuse me . Sorry . Excuse me . Pardon me . Oh , my God . You wouldn 't be pregnant pregnant . Sort of a guest host situation . We fertilize the egg . We implant it in the peritoneal cavity . Dose it with Expectane . Tiny thing , grain of rice . You carry it the first trimester . We get our data . Boom , it 's over . Four " A. " To your left . 51 " F. " All the way back . I 'm gonna just go- - l guess I was wrong about you , Hesse . I took you for a scientist . - l am a scientist . - Yeah ? Where 's your vision ? Jenner infected himself with smallpox to test his vaccine . - That 's Jenner . - So why not you ? is it possible ? Who knows ? Natural ? So what ? Good science ? You bet . Come and claim your place in the pantheon . You 're just trying to manipulate me . Yes , I am . So what ? Excuse me , sir. I 'm gonna have to ask you to take your seat . Yeah , all right . Just a second . Look , cards on the table . I don 't like you any more than you like me . You got all the warmth and charm of a walleyed pike . If we weren 't partners- - But the point is , we are partners . We 're on the verge of something fantastic . Something important . I need you to carry it through with me . - This could really work . - Yes , it could . - Are you sure you can find an egg ? - No problem . Okay , who 's the lucky one ? " Junior " ? Okay , Junior , let 's go for a ride . God . Dr. Arbogast . - Dr. Reddin , what are you doin ' here ? - Where ? I don 't know- - What ? Where am I ? Oh , the lab . Good . Excellent . My lab . My lab . So ... what brings you here ? It 's like ... when a ball player gets traded ... and he goes out into the ballpark . He comes back and- - You know , just ... alone with his thoughts . Just to memorize the turf ... the infield ... the angles of the light . What ? - You got a piece of cheese . - lt 's from my sandwich . So what are you doing in this lab ? - Oh , I 'm- - Here , right over there . - Oh , thanks . Actually , I 'm- - l see you kept Minnie and Moe . - Oh , yes , Minnie and Moe . - Kept them . I could hardly turn out an expectant mother , could I ? - No . Well , Alex will be very happy . - Good . 'Cause I get the feeling that Dr. Hesse blames me for the loss of his facility . He did take it kind of hard . I 'd hate to see his work go unfinished because of budget constraints . Would you tell him that I 'd be more than happy to help out ... with lab time and materials , even some space ... if- - l don 't know what you think- - he might be amenable to sharing . That would be extremely generous ... and more helpful than you can imagine . So ... is there a Mr. Dr. Reddin ? Who ? No . Sorry . Maybe we could have dinner sometime . - No . - No . - Your back ? - Yeah , back . - So- - - You 're off . - Bye . - Bye . - Thanks for coming . - Okay . Way to go . This is it . Terrific motility . - Excellent count . - Let me see . Strong swimmers . Big load . Way to go . 2 : 45 a.m. Subject takes 15 cc 's Expectane ... supplemented with 100 milligrams of progesterone ... two milligrams of estrogen . Salud . - So how 's the Expectane taste ? - Bitter . Well , we 'll add some flavoring when we market it . Good idea . All right . Let 's find the spot . All right , let 's see . Peritoneal cavity . Let 's see here . That looks like a good , clear window right there . There 's plenty of room to hold the embryo through the first trimester . - A little lower . - Yeah . - Right over here . - That 's it . All right . Let 's put a bun in your oven . Where did you get the egg , by the way ? The egg ? Colleague of mine . An anonymous harvest . Had a couple of spares . Just relax . Here we go . Yeah . Navigatin ' . Mama . Larry ? Larry ! What , what , what ? Hi . - Where am I ? - This is my house . You 're staying with me during the protocol , remember ? Let 's see how you are . I forgot . Here . Put that under your tongue . This your bedroom ? No , it 's my ex-wife 's bedroom . Cheery , huh ? She decorated it herself . She had taste . Give her that . You had separate bedrooms ? No . We didn 't always have separate bedrooms . Good . There are many stops along the road to divorce . Blood pressure 's good . Let 's check this out . Normal . Very good . - l have to pee . - l need that too . Here . Fill ' er up . We 're gonna do the tests at 8 : 00 a.m. and again at 10 : 00 p.m. I got a prenatal monitor and a blood screener ordered up . Do you mind ? Can I have some privacy ? You know , it was really nice of Dr. Reddin to let us share her lab . I 'll go there to analyze and collate the fluid samples . All right . Sounds good . That should be enough . All right now , this watch is set to go off every four hours ... to remind you to take the Expectane . What do you think ? Six times a day should do it . That should do it . Let 's see how we did . I must be crazy to be doing this . You may be crazy , but you 're also pregnant . Congratulations . I 'm pregnant . So embryo three is entering its two-to-four stage . Today we 'll be extracting an eight-cell cluster ... and freezing it ... for induced suspension and development arrest . - Dr. Hesse ? Can I get you anything ? - l 'm looking for any ... cryogenic disruption to the D.N.A. footprints . - He 's fine . - Good . Excellent . - Let 's get on with it , okay ? - What about this ? - Here to see the new mama ! - Oh , hi , Dr. Arbogast . - Hi ! - Banana , they 'll love it . Mother and daughter are doing fine . She 's a pretty baby . Oh , looks just like you . Got your ears . You like that ? You can eat it . Don 't you want to eat it ? Yeah . Hey , big guy , how they swinging ' ? - What 's the matter ? You okay ? - Yeah . What , what ? Look , my H.C.G. levels aren 't where they should be . Let 's up the hormone supplement five milliliters . How you feelin ' otherwise ? I just can 't keep anything down . That 's morning sickness . It 'll pass . Eat crackers . My nipples are very sensitive . What ? My nipples- - They feel like , kind of , tingling . - Tingling like sore or like itchy ? - You surf ? Surf , ' cause I got that a lot from paddling out . It 's something about the wax and the salt water. lt irritates them . - You get what ? - His nipples are tingling . - l don 't surf . - lt could be your laundry detergent . I used to get that when I used a non-biodegradable soap . Thank you very much for your concern . It 's very nice . Or it could be that polyester shirt . I don 't know how much more of this I can handle . You 're doin ' great. I talked to my guy at Lyndon this morning . They saw the initial data . They are ecstatic . I 'm gonna meet with their C.E.O. at the convention in San Francisco next month . What ? Cramps ? Come on . Get up . Let 's go walk it off . Let 's go . Let 's go . Look , I don 't want to cut back the hormones altogether . It 'll jeopardize the protocol . A tingle and tummy ache won 't kill ya . - Okay . - Dr. Hesse ! - Boy , here she comes . - Excuse me . - Excuse me . - Just what we need . I know this is none of my business . I can 't help but notice the lethargy , the nausea ... the little vials you keep leaving in the wastepaper basket . Yes ? Do you have a substance abuse problem ? - What ? - No ! There 's nothing to be ashamed of . I was involved in a study ... in Oxford where it was categoric- - This is serious. I 'm very concerned . It 's been going on for nearly a month , and I think he should see someone . There is a tragic disease that afflicts the men ... of his village in Austria . They even named it after the place . It 's called , " Gelandensprung Syndrome . " - Gelandensprung ? - Yeah . - You 've heard of it ? - No . I 'm not surprised. lt 's endemic to only a few places in all the world . Well , what is it ? It 's a terrible , debilitating ... relentless , you know , kind of- - Fatness . - Fatness . - Fatness ? Striking young men in their prime , turning them into big ... - wheezing- - - Strudelhunds . - Strudelhunds . - Strudelhunds ? Pastry hounds . Yeah , that 's the ... insult that they hurl upon them . I 'm gonna go get you some crackers , because ... it 'll head off trouble that 's approaching . He 's gonna be all right . - Banes ! - But you 're not fat . Oh , because I 'm taking a new formula . I 've only nine more weeks of the protocol . It 's funny how you don 't appreciate somebody until they 're gone . I 'm not gone . You 're gone . What do you want to talk about ? It 's about our contract . You got a couple of minutes ? Not really . I really need to talk to you . I feel so humiliated . Don 't be . People get sick all the time . There 's no need to be ashamed . I feel like I lost control over my body . Control 's important to you , isn 't it ? What do you mean ? Same three shirts , week in , week out . Same coat peg , same wash basin . That odd little ritual with the liverwurst and apple every day . I like order . What 's wrong with that ? Nothing . It 's just an observation . And I don 't like being sick . is there anything wrong with that ? No. lt 's just that men- - - Men what ? - They 're pathetic when it comes to pain . You should try being a woman sometime . It 's a nightmare . Your body goes peculiar with your period and doesn 't stop until menopause . It 's a lifetime of leaking and swelling ... and spotting and smears . Crippling cramps , raging hormones , yeasts ! And that 's if everything 's normal . - l never wanted to be a woman . - l 'm just saying . That 's perfectly normal . Not to worry . Just stay off your feet . Use an ice pack for a few minutes every hour ... and call me in the morning . - Larry ! - No , it 's okay . That 's why I 'm here . - Lar ! - All right . Bye-bye . Look at this . Leave ' em alone . - Don 't snap at me . - Angela , this is my house now . Larry , you may live here . You may die here , but this will always be my house . Floral , houndstooth , then paisley . Alex , Angela . Angela , Alex . Colleague of mine . Nice to meet you- - God , excuse me . Charmed . - l 'm going upstairs to my bedroom . - Yeah . He 's going through a confusing time . I 'm letting him stay here for a couple of weeks . - So what do you want ? - l don 't like Sneller . Angela , we 've been over this . Ned Sneller is a top , top guy . He 's creepy , Larry . I 'm not goin ' back to him . - You 're bein ' ridiculous . - No , I 'm not . I can 't deal with this . Where 's the goddamn father ? - l haven 't been able to reach him . - He disappeared ? They 're touring. I don 't know . Europe , Asia ? I can 't remember which . Who is ? Aerosmith . One of Aerosmith knocked you up ? What a lovely phrase , Larry . Oh , excuse me . I 'm a little shocked here . - You 're gonna have to deal with it . - l don 't have to deal with it . We 're divorced . Remember ? It 's not like I 'm asking you to fix my car . All right . Call Louise in the morning , and she 'll fit you in . - Thank you . - Angela . I am happy for ya . Thanks , Lar . - What 's the matter ? - She was daddy 's little girl . Don 't the pictures of your lifetime deserve Kodak film ? - Now he 's giving her away . - Come on . - Come on . Get a grip . - Okay . Physically , you 're in tiptop shape . Everything 's right on track . - All right , one more week . That 's it . - Okay . I 'm sorry. I 'm just not myself . - Just relax . All right ? - Yeah . Don 't wait up for me tonight . I 'm gonna be late . Why ? Where are you going ? To the pharmaceutical convention at the Hyatt. I 'm meeting the Lyndon guys . - The convention is tonight ? - Yeah. I told you it was tonight . Oh , Larry , please take me with you . No . You stay home . Get back in bed and just take it easy . You don 't understand . - l do understand . No ! - Please , listen to me . - No. lt 's bad for business . - l 'm pregnant and all alone . Will you stop saying that ? You 're not pregnant pregnant . You got to think of this as an experiment . Think of it like you swallowed a piece of gum . A tiny piece . Dentyne . Look , I won 't be in your way . I 'll take walks. I 'll disappear . Please , I feel so isolated . Oh , all right . Okay , you can come . But don 't do that thing with your eyes . - l can come ? - Yeah . Oh , Larry . But I have nothing to wear . Oh , I 'm starting to get a little headache over here . I feel we could make a definite contribution here . Sounds good . Excellent . And you got to remember that we 're talking ... about five million prescriptions a year in the United States minimum . What 's the window on these human experiments results ? Between you and I , I would say , definite results within a week . - That fast ? - Yes . - We are very impressed . Keep us posted . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Thank you . Yes ! - Interesting pitch , Larry . - Banes . What are you doing here ? You know me. I like to keep my ear to the ground . You know , of course , that human experimentation ... is against university and F.D.A. guidelines . I 'm just trying to raise a little awareness and some new money ... telling people we 're further along than we really are . is there a woman out there taking Expectane ? Absolutely not . Larry ! Noah ! Hi ! - Where have you been ? - l had so much fun . I had a walk and then the most wonderful massage in a health club . I had a great time . Then I took a nap right there on the table . Franks in blankets ? Oh , these are my favorites . Alex , you look ... radiant . - Thank you . - We should be going . Let 's go . - Want some franks in the blankets ? - No . - l 'm so sorry . - No , no , I 'm sorry . It 's a wonder the woman is still alive . She looks so beautiful tonight , don 't you think so ? I got it . Thank you . Thank you very much . - Where have you been ? - Hello , Dr. Arbogast . - Long line for the loo . - Hors d 'oeuvres ? Sausage rolls . Thank you. I love these . These are my favorites . You look so- - l don 't know . Enthusiastic . Yes , you do . You look positively lit up . What 's the good news ? - No good news ! - Life , music and friends . - Franks in the blankets. I love it . - l think we should be going . Let 's go . We should go . Going , going , always going ... and one day , gone . Poof ... just like that . When we should be pausing to hear the joyful melody of life itself . He doesn 't get out much . Neither do I . I 've got you Under my skin - l always loved this song . - Oh , no . Would you like to dance ? I don 't know how . I 've never danced before either . - Then , I think we should give it a try . - Good . - Could you hold this ? Thank you . - Thank you . Where you goin ' ? I 've got you Under my skin I tried so Not to give in I said to myself This affair never will go So well But why should I try to resist When , darling I know so well l 've got you Okay ? - All right . - Under my skin I 'd sacrifice anything come what might For the sake of having you near ln spite of a warning voice That comes in the night And repeats and repeats in my ear Don 't you know , little fool You never can win Use your mentality Wake up to reality But each time I do just the thought of you Makes me stop Before I begin - Excuse me. I found it . - ' Cause I 've got you - Under my skin - Thank you . Under my skin Under my skin Prince Charming , the coach is leaving . Right . Yes . Thank you . I enjoyed that very much . I loved it . Let 's do it again . Good night . Now , what is takin ' so long ? They lost it , I know . What good is havin ' a ticket ? What are you doin ' ? What are you- - Come over here . - What are you doing ? - Feel how soft my skin is . It 's time . We 're closin ' out the experiment . Banes is sniffing ' around ... and your hormone surges are gettin ' out of control . But there 's still a week left until the trimester is over . We have plenty of data . The Lyndon guys are poised . I don 't wanna risk anything goin ' wrong . Come on . What ? I can 't help but wonder what it would be like . What what would be like ? To have my baby . That 's it . We 're closin ' out the experiment tonight . Now . Get in the car . Come on . " To have my baby . " " Feel how soft my skin is . " Where 'd you go , to France to get the car or somethin ' ? - l never realized how lonely l was . - Get a dog ! What are you so gloomy about ? Come on . The experiment worked . With Moe , I tapered off the dosage gradually . To aid his system with the hormonal rebalancing . No . You go cold turkey . You may have a couple of rocky days , but I don 't want to risk any complications . Just stop taking the Expectane . The embryo will break down ... and be reabsorbed naturally into your body . Home sweet home . So , I 'll get all the data over to the guys at Lyndon . And I 'll be in touch with you as soon as I hear anything , okay ? Okay . - lf you have any reaction , call me . - Sure . All right . So- - I don 't know if you 're a boy or a girl ... so I 'll call you Junior . Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Alex Happy birthday to you What a surprise . How did you know ? - We looked it up in your file . - Did you bake this ? - Stop that . Really . - Did you bake this yourself ? - The ingredients mutated a bit . - Happy birthday , big guy . All right ! Alex , you 're sweating like a racehorse . You all right ? - lt 's hot in here . - No , it 's not . - l 'm really hot . - What ? You got a fever ? I did not forget the ice cream . You think you 're the first clown who ever woke up one day and said ... " l 'm bored . I think I 'll have a kid . " I didn 't say that . Why are you being so negative ? Hello ? Anybody home ? You 're a guy , Alex . This is totally against the natural order . Guys do not have babies . We leave that to the women . That 's part of the beauty of bein ' a guy . Didn 't your father ever have this talk with you ? If you don 't want to help me , say so . I don 't need a lecture . The hell you don 't . If you could feel for one minute the sense of absolute joy and connection ... that carrying your baby brings , you would understand . Listen to you . Have you lost it completely ? Now , come inside . If I carry this baby to term , it will be a miracle . Shut up ! I would love , protect and nurture that miracle with everything I 've got . - Stop it ! - No ! I want my baby ! Sorry I 'm late . We 'll just be a couple of minutes , then I 'm ready . Dr. Arbogast , your ex-wife 's inside . You 're late for her appointment . - Hello , Dr. Hesse . - Come here , sit down . - l don 't want to sit around here . - Sit down ! Right here . There 's nothin ' to be afraid of . He thinks he 's pregnant . It 's a very fascinating case . I 'm workin ' in conjunction with the university 's psychiatric center . Auto-physiological suggestion . - What 's goin ' on ? - Get in here . - How ya doin ' ? - How are ya ? Nice to see ya . - Oh , you 're lookin ' good . - Thanks . - Okay , you can go . - That 's it ? That 's it . Something very important came up . - Larry , I 'm important . - You are . Very . But this is urgent . Just get dressed and we 'll reschedule . Sorry . So , how far along are you ? Twenty-one weeks . - ls this your first ? - Yes . Have you thought of any names ? Junior if it is a boy . And if it 's a girl ... Junior . Oh , those are nice . - So , how about you ? - Alex . Excuse me . - Good luck . - Thank you . - Junior would be good . - Junior 's good . There 's the feet ... and the hands . This can 't be happening . But it is . Oh , look , that little string of pearls . - That 's the spine . - That 's the spine , yeah . There 's the head . My baby . Listen to this . That 's the heartbeat . - That 's very fast . - 140 beats a minute . Perfectly normal . In fact , everything 's perfectly normal . Except for the fact that the mom is also the dad . If this gets out , your life is over . You 're a freak . My license ? Kiss it good-bye . It 's not gonna get out . I know this is unfair to you . And it 's dangerous for both of us , but I want my baby . And I need your help . Okay , but you got to move back in with me . I want you off your feet as much as possible . - And no goin ' to the lab . - But- - No buts about it . You 're in for a lot of sacrifices . - You better get used to that . - Okay . Okay . So , otherwise , how you feelin ' ? Anything unusual ? Jesus , what the heck am I talkin ' about ? " Anything unusual ? " I 've noticed that the side effects of pregnancy are greatly amplified ... with the dosage of Expectane that I 've required . The morning sickness , the mood swings . - Sleepiness , sexual appetite . - Sexual appetite ? Yesterday , just scooping the middle out of a honeydew melon gave me a- - - A steifen . - A what ? Oh . That 's normal . I get ' em all the time . - Here we go . - lt 's nice to be back . Yeah. lt 's going to be a lot of fun . - Do I have the same room again ? - You betcha . What do you want to do tonight ? Should we stay in or go out for dinner ? Didn 't I close down the Expectane project six months ago ? Yes , sir . Then why would Diana Reddin 's account show continuing requisitions ... for Expectane components ? is she up to something with Arbogast and Hesse ? I don 't know , sir . Larry , I 'm not whining . It 's just that you said you 'd be home no later than 6 : 00 . It 's 6 : 45 . The pasta is ready . In five minutes , they 'll be soft . Well , fine , then come home whenever you want ! Selfish . - Diana . Hi . - Yes , it 's me . Hello . Someone gave me these papers for you from the lab . Thank you . Who ? Who ? I 'm lying. I 'm- - l just- - Actually , I just wanted to see you . You did ? - Come in , please . - Thank you . I 'm sorry I lied . Oh , what a lovely room ! Very nice of Dr. Arbogast to put you up . - lt is . - Nice man . How are you ? How are you feeling ? Good . Thank you . And you ? Good . Cooking ? - Yes . - Smells very nice . You want to sit down ? Please . Alex , do you believe in reincarnation ... past lives or ... anything like that ? - No . - No , neither do I , so it can 't be that . Can 't be what ? I have this strong recurring feeling that I know you . - You do know me . - Yes. I know . No , but I mean ... I mean from before , somehow , from earlier . I can 't- - l was born in Jakarta . And raised in England , from the age of five in Kent ... and summers in Cornwall . What are you looking at ? I was- - l was born in Austria in Gelandensprung . - Home to the strudelhunds . - Yes . Well , I 've never- - l 've never actually been to Gelandensprung . Salzburg , once . Delicious chocolates . Good-looking waiters . - Alex . - Yes ? You 're twitching . What 's the matter ? - Does my body disgust you ? - What ? My body . is it disgusting ? No . No . No . What wou- - Oh ! No ! No , I mean , l-l-l like ... upholstery on a man . In fact , I was madly in love with my cousin , Trevor , for years ... and he was very portly . Maybe it 's physical . - This connection . - Yes . No , it is , definitely physical . Out of the blue , I get these sudden , these pangs of concern for your- - for your well- - You mean ... sex ? Yes . I hadn 't thought of that . I have . Have you ? Yes . Well , then , that 's , uh- - - That 's probably it then , isn 't it ? - Yes . Yes . No , wait . Wait. lf l- - Hello ? Lar ? I let myself in . - Where 's Larry ? - He 's out . Found it . Found it . There we go. lt 's in . Contact lens . Just flipped out , right over the sofa . - Who 's that ? - Dr. Diana Reddin . Nice to meet you . Going now . Bye . Good , you were right . - Very good . Bye . - Wait , Diana . - Yes ? - l have my own bedroom . I 'd love to see it sometime . I can 't stay . I have to go . Sorry . Got it . Got it . Do you ever think about calling before you come over ? I 'm sorry if I interrupted . Man , what is that great smell ? I 'm cooking . You 're cooking ? - What ? - Pasta . - You want some more Rocky Road ? - Oh , yeah . So , Diana . She seems like a very nice person . Definitely a little nervous , but nice . You think it 's serious ? Well , I 'm in a particularly vulnerable stage in my life right now ... - so I 'm taking it slowly . - That 's very smart . Can I have more of those ribs ? How about you and the father ? I haven 't heard from him since it happened . Bastard . I never expected to hear from him . I 'm happy . I love being pregnant . It 's just that I 'm not 21 anymore . I 'm single . - lt 's a little bit scary . - Tell me about it . I love those pickles . There 's a couple of chicken wings left . What ? Anybody ever tell you that you eat like a pregnant woman ? I just like mixing cuisines . Baby pushed . Yes . What 's wrong with you ? Sympathy pains . I hardly know you . You must be a very sympathetic guy . Lately , yes . - l think she really likes me . - Oh , yeah ? What makes you say that ? Well , she said she likes a little upholstery on a guy . And she kissed me . You 're kissing ? Wait a minute , Alex . You 're in no condition to start a relationship . - Don 't be so negative . - What do you mean , negative ? Wait a minute . I 'm not negative . So , what do ya think ? Couldn 't find one with a parrot on it ? It 's nice. lt 's nice . You know , Larry , I 'm starting to believe in fate . My baby , finding a compatible woman . I think it 's all part of a design . Maybe I should see a psychic . Psychiatrist . We should both see him . I hate my body . Looking prosperous there . - The pants are loose in the waist . - l could take them in . Better leave room to grow . - That 's a good idea . - That 's the spirit ! - l 'll cuff ' em for you . - Okay . - What ? - Junior kicked again . - Junior ? - Yeah . - Why Junior ? - The book says to talk to the baby . I didn 't know if it 's going to be a boy or a girl , so I just called it Junior . Why ? - Well , nothing. I was- - - lt 's something . You have that look . No , the guy I got the egg from , he called it Junior . He was makin ' a joke , you know , just a funny coincidence . Who is that guy ? You said a colleague of yours had an anonymous harvest . - Yeah , a colleague of mine . - Do I know him ? Nah , you don 't know him . - Do we know about the donor egg ? - No , it 's anonymous . Well , well , how very domestic . All that 's missing is the pitter-patter of little feet . Banes . Forgotten , but not gone . - What the hell do you want ? - l couldn 't help overhearing you . Something about a donor egg ? - l don 't know what you mean . - Come on , guys , it 's me , Noah . I 'm nobody 's fool . I checked with the primate lab . They told me the chimps haven 't been tested on ... since the project was terminated . But you 're still producing Expectane . Well , the truth is that ... - we had a surplus of the steroid base . - Surplus . Rather than let it go to waste ... - we decided to- - - We decided to ... - finish off the production run , - That 's it . stockpile the Expectane for when the F.D.A. does approve clinical trials . We were unaware of the university policy , so that 's why the little fib . If there are any budget overruns , we 're more than happy- - - Absolutely . Cover them . - Excuse me . Yeah . - What 's that all about ? - l don 't know . - What are you doin ' , writin ' a book ? - You know what I think ? I think you two cowboys have ... an Expectane-assisted pregnancy underway here in this house . - Sorry , you 're wrong . - Oh , that hardly ever happens . Listen , Larry , I 'm on your side . If you guys are coloring outside the lines , I can help . Look , Banes , I 'm speaking English . There 's nothin ' goin ' on ! How can I help you if you leave me outside the loop ? Thanks for stoppin ' by . Okay . Listen , could I use your bathroom before I go ? Yeah. lt 's down the hall . Make a right . Pick up the seat . - ls he gone ? - No , he 's in the can . Where are you ? Come out , little mother . - You think he believed us ? - l don 't know . This guy 's dangerous . Stay away from him . I will . Here . - l 'm taking Diana out to dinner . - Great . Who is that ? Aerosmith . You don 't like their music ? Seven years , I tried everything . I couldn 't get Angela pregnant . One of these clowns , one night , one shot , mission accomplished . Just ain 't fair . - Which one ? - l don 't know . Doesn 't matter . You still love her . Ah , no , it 's good it 's over . It 's just this baby thing has got me a little , you know- - l 'm having some feelings , you know . That 's all . - l 'm sorry , Larry . - Yeah . Thanks . - Well , you look ... good . - Thank you . Hi , Angela . Hey , Alex . is he home ? - Yes . - ls he alone ? - Very . He will be very happy to see you . - Yeah , I 'll bet . I 'm really very sorry . I 'm just a bit confused about this strudelhund thing . - Excuse me. I believe this is yours . - Yes ? Oh , it is . Thank you . Sorry . Thanks very much . Got it . Safe and sound . Yes , the strudelhund thing . No one 's ever heard of it ... and then I looked up Gelandensprung in my atlas and it wasn 't there . So- - You 're right . There 's no Gelandensprung . There 's no strudelhunds . I 'm sorry I had to deceive you . Well , what 's goin ' on ? I want you to know everything about me . Likewise . Can you keep an open mind ? I mean , really wide open ? I think so , yes . I have a most extraordinary condition . Thank you . You familiar with the works of Edward Jenner ? The vaccination chap who experimented on himself ? That 's right . Now , probably you would never ... experiment on yourself- - No , I have actually. I mean , nothing so extraordinary as Jenner , obviously ... but l- - l used my cryogenic technique to freeze one of my own eggs . You did ? Why ? Well ... I 've always wanted children and l- - l never found the person that I want to- - you know- - l 'm not getting younger , so I thought , well , I 'll just save one , just in case . It 's in the dairy section under " Junior . " What did you say ? - My egg is in the freezer at the lab . - You call it Junior ? Yes. I know . Well , I couldn 't put my own name because everybody would know . And you can 't tell if it 's a boy or a girl , so I thought Junior would- - - Junior . - l know. I 've shocked you , haven 't I ? I suppose it is a bit perverse , having your own eggs on display ... but some people keep their tonsils , their adenoids and appendixes and- - Anyway , enough , sorry . I 'm embarrassing you . So , what- l 'm sorry. I have to go . - Alex ? Alex . What 's the matter ? Not a roll , not a kick , not in two days . Oh , I know something 's wrong . There 's something wrong . is that what you want to hear ? No ! All the drugs the father took probably messed her up good . - What drugs ? - l read up on Aerosmith . Wasted for a decade . Coke , booze , pills . - What are you talking about ? - Which one is he ? Did you think it was someone in the band ? is that what you thought ? Well , that 's what you said . No , that he was on tour with them . He 's not in the band . He 's their personal trainer . For God- - - Oh ! She kicked . - She kicked . - She just kicked . - All right , Larry , come with me now . - What ? - Where did you get Junior ? - l told you . - The truth ! We 're talking about my baby . Keep your voice down . All right . I got it from Reddin 's lab . So ? Well , it 's Diana 's . - You mean , hers , personally ? - Yes ! You 're supposed to get an anonymous egg . I tried . Everybody was all out . - Can you do anything right ? - Wait , don 't start with me . If you 'd have stopped taking the Expectane ... none of this would be an issue . - What a horrible thing to say . - Well , it 's the truth . Keepin ' it goin ' was your idea , not mine . Women have such convenient memories when they 're pregnant . Now take that back . All right , that was a Freudian slip . I know you 're not a woman . No . The part about I should have ended it . Junior heard that . - Now take it back . - For cryin ' out loud. I take it back . No , mean it . All right , Junior , I 'm sorry . I take it back . I just felt a kick . Come . Feel it . - No , I don 't think so . - Come on . Just feel it . - Come . We need a healing experience . - Give me a break , will ya ? Just do it ! Here . Just watch . Be patient . - Did you see that ? Right there . - Yeah . - Oh , see his little feet go . - Right there ! Oh , it feels so good . Can you believe this ? - What 's goin ' on ? - What ? Nothin ' . - What ? - You were touching him . Oh , God . Oh , no . I can 't deal with this . Can 't deal with what ? What are you ? What are you two , like a- - What are you , a twosome ? What ? No . What is goin ' on around here ? He 's- - He 's pregnant . I 'm gonna be a mama too . - You 're sure it 's the Expectane ? - Absolutely . We compared what you gave us with the sample we had on file in the lab . Who do they think they 're dealing with ? That 's what really hurts . Well , we 're gonna have to find out who she is . - And there 's something else . - What ? The sample that you gave us , it was part Expectane and part female hormones . Estrogens and progesterone , to be exact . Wouldn 't that be consistent with an assisted pregnancy ? Not a dosage of this size . This is more like the amount you 'd take , say ... preparing for a sex change operation . Oh , my God ! You 're doing some more charting . We 'll have to do the whole thing again . - Diana . - We 're busy . Please , I need to talk to you . You need to apologize to me , don 't you ? About last night , I 'm sorry , Diana . - Please let me explain . - All right , then go on , explain . Guys , would you mind ? What ? I 'm pregnant . Good explanation . I really am pregnant . What ? I tested the Expectane on myself . We fertilized an egg and implanted it into my abdomen . With drug and hormone supplements , I 'm now seven months to term . Oh , my God ! There 's more . More ? Larry was supposed to find an anonymous egg ... and he couldn 't . So he borrowed one from your dairy section . - lt 's Junior . - My Junior ? Our Junior now . Our Junior ? Our Junior ! - Diana , please , don 't be angry . - Why should I be angry ? You 've lied to me , you steal from me ... you engage in an utterly immoral ... selfish , arrogant stunt without any regard for my feelings whatsoever . What- - What am I supposed to be , grateful ? This is just ... so male ! - l 'm sorry , Diana . - Just don 't come near me ! - l never wanted to hurt you . - What did you think you were doing ? You think men don 't have enough ? You have to take this away as well ? You- - lt 's- - lt 's pitiful ! Let me shake hands with the Man Who Would Be Mom . - What are you talking about ? - The greatest scientific breakthrough ... in the history of this university . Bravo , Doctor . You know , we 're in this together , now . We have a contract . And I quote , " Exploitation of results from university-funded research ... shall be at the sole discretion of the university . " - Come on. I 've ordered some tests . - Leave me alone . - He said to leave him alone . - Escort Dr. Hesse to the ambulance . Can 't allow it ! He 's in a very delicate condition . I 'm really disappointed in you , Diana . You and your baby are university property now . No , I 'm not . My body , my choice . Yes ! Come on , Alex . Go ! Just easy , easy . Breathe . Breathe . - That was really scary . - Relax. I gotta hide you . - That ought to be easy . - Yeah . - So what did Diana say ? - She said I was selfish and arrogant . That we 'd taken away her dignity and the sacred role of womanhood . Typical. I can 't tell you how many times I 've heard pregnant women complain ... " l just wish a man could go through this . " You finally do it , and what do you get ? Attitude and insults . - Yeah , you 're right . - Oh , I 'm tellin ' ya . Alex , are you sure you 're gonna be able to go through with this ? I think so . I don 't have a lot of choice . - Hello . - Hello . Whoa , it 's nice . Hello . - How are you ? - Hi . - lt 's quite a place . Hi . - Hello . - You must be Mr. and Mrs. Hesse ? - Yes . Welcome . Welcome to Casitas Madres . I think of Casitas Madres as a health resort for expectant mothers . We want you to completely relax while you 're here . That 's really good news because that 's exactly what Alexandra needs ... to just totally relax . Would you have some lemonade , Larry , Alexandra ? I 'll have a little if it 's okay . I realize that my appearance might be a bit startling . It is sometimes difficult for people to take . If I may speak to your concerns ? Yes , by all means . When I was a sportswoman in the East German Olympic track-and-field team ... they dispensed anabolic steroids as freely ... as here in America they dole out Gatorade . They pushed it on them . I mean , just- - Nothing was mentioned of the side effects ... that are now so obviously , painfully apparent . But I 'm all woman . - Believe you me . - Of course . I 'm almost eight months pregnant , and my Larry has to travel on business . I dread the thought of leaving her helpless and alone . That 's why we 're here . Alexandra ... you 've come to the right place . And ... may I say something else ? - What ? - You are beautiful . - Thank you . Thank you . - Yes , you are . And you 'll love your room . It 's got a great big tub . Oh . Big tub . That 'll come in handy . Anyway , so tomorrow ... I catch the first flight out to Vancouver to meet with the Lyndon guys . Shouldn 't take more than three , four days , tops . You okay , honey ? Come on . Okay , right this way . You have your temperature control and your call button . It 's a very nice room , huh ? And extra blankets in the drawer . - Here 's your key . - l want you to take good care of her . - Oh , of course we will . - Yeah . - No . - All right . Bye . Big . It 's nice . Larry . You really think the baby 's gonna be born ? I wanna say , " Of course , " but there 's no precedent for this . - Gods knows what 's goin ' on in there . - But everything 's gonna be all right ? - Gods knows what 's goin ' on in there . - But everything 's gonna be all right ? It better be . It 's my baby too , you know . Take it easy . Thanks for everything , Larry . Diana ? It 's Alex . In case you 're there , please pick up . I really need to talk to you . Please . Push , push , push , okay . A little more gentle with babies . I love you . Oh , that 's marvelous ! I guess so . And remember , no names . This isn 't a test . Thanks . Well , this should be very interesting . Let 's see . She writes ... " My biggest fear is that I 'm not exactly ... what you would call a natural born mother . How will I ever cope ? " You know ... I think we have to dispense with the myth ... that some are born with the maternal instinct ... and others are not . The little girl tending her doll collection is ... no more a natural born mother than the tomboy down the street . There is no standard . There are no naturals . Hello , Diana . Very fetching . You might want to rethink the earrings . I 'm glad you came. I started to wonder if I 'd ever see you again . - Well , I needed some time to think . - And ? It 's so unfair what you 've done . This is t- - Monumentally unfair . Will you forgive me ? I wouldn 't be asking anything of me at the moment . I totally understand if you never want to see me again . - l take responsibility for the baby . - Wait ! Can we just get one thing straight here ? This is my baby too . - Don 't you ever forget that ! - l won 't . - l 'm the mother . You 're the father . - Yes . Yes . - ls that clear ? - Yes . We 'll have to find an intelligent way of sharing the responsibilities . - Yes . Yes . - Of creating security and a home life ... - Yes . - and a normal upbringing ! - Yes . - l mean , all this is very complicated . I know it is . And I thought that I would be- - That I would be- - You are . I want us to do this together . Do you have a private room ? Yes . Why ? Call me old-fashioned , but I 'll be damned ... if I 'm having a child with a man I never slept with . So , where- - where is it ? You coming ? Bye . I 'd better get out of here before anyone sees me . If everything is satisfactory , please sign all copies where tagged . If everything is satisfactory , please sign all copies where tagged . Once we have European approval , the F.D.A. will agree to testing . - Leave it to us . - Potential for your drug is remarkable . - We 'll be rich . - Loaded . That 's got a nice ring to it . Loaded . What 's the matter ? Would you put this call through to California ? Sure , Dr. Arbogast . Over there . Oh , yeah . I should call the doctor just to be sure . I just need to lie down . Oh , damn it . Come on . Lyndon 's coming in as partners . This is gonna push us through the F.D.A. Alex , are you okay ? Yeah , Ned . Set up an emergency C-section for tonight . I want everybody out of the building except you and Louise . You wanna do an operation with just the two of us ? Just us . We 're the whole team . You can 't do an emergency C-section without an anesthesiologist . We can handle it . Bye . She didn 't come down for lunch . - You better call Dr. Talbot . - Right . Diana , please , hurry. I need you . I 'm coming ! Okay ? I 'm coming ! I 'm coming ! - l need the car. I need the keys . - On the desk . - Here . - Thank you . You said to let you know if something was going on here . Something 's definitely goin ' on . They 're sendin ' everybody home . An emergency C-something . Does that mean anything to you ? - Open the door , please . - l want my Larry . In the meantime , let 's have our doctor take a look at you . There is nothing to worry about . I think it 's important that I see you . I don 't wanna see you ! - Where is he ? - He ? Who ? He , my- - She , my wife ! Oh , Alexandra . She 's upstairs . Thank God you 're here . Pumpkin ? - Back ! Excuse me ! Pardon me ! - Thank God you 're here . Larry . Pumpkin ! All right . I can take care of her . - Okay , okay . Just breathe . - Oh , my God ! Here it comes ! Here it comes ! Oh , I feel the baby . The baby ! The baby ! Oh , shit ! Are you all right ? Are you all right ? What the hell are you doin ' here ? What am I doing here ? It 's my baby , not yours ! - l put it in there . - My egg . - Your egg doesn 't make you the mother . - Shut up ! - Go ahead . - Take me outta here ! Do we have to bounce so much ? Just a couple of miles like this . You okay , Alex ? Oh , I feel like Junior kicked a hole through something . Louise , I wanna talk to Sneller . - Oh , I want to die ! - Breathe . Breathe . - Stop blowing at me ! - Sorry . - l 'm about a half hour away . - Larry . What is goin ' on ? Somebody from the university has got a whole bunch of media out front . Banes . Damn it ! Can you get rid of ' em ? I don 't think so . Larry , what is this ? I don 't wanna talk on the cellular . Just meet us outside ! - What 's goin ' on ? - Somebody tipped the press . - Oh , what are we gonna do ? - l don 't know. I 'm thinkin ' . Better be big . You pulled me away from dinner with the university 's largest benefactor . This is big , Edward , literally and figuratively . Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention , please ? Thank you for waiting . I 'm Noah Banes ... director of Lufkin 's Biotechnology Research Center . This is Edward Sawyer , president of Leland University . We are here to announce a momentous breakthrough in medical science . Under my personal guidance and supervision ... and with the aid of a new wonder drug , Expectane ... Dr. Alexander Hesse of my staff will be arriving shortly ... to give birth to a child he has himself carried to term . - Are you saying he 's pregnant ? - Yes . I am saying he 's pregnant . I see him ! And what perfect timing . Here he is now , ladies and gentlemen . I give you the world 's first pregnant man . What is it ? What are you doin ' here ? This is my building . Get outta here . I got a medical emergency . Go on . Back off . Hi , Mom . What is this ? - lt 's just a woman . - That 's my wife you 're talkin ' about . Hey , Ned . Thank you . All right , okay , baby . Watch your step . - Okay . - Up here . - Okay . - Okay . Up ! Upsa-daisie . Upsa-daisie . I 've got you. I 've got you . Come on , give me room . Ned , let 's get her in there . - You told us there was a pregnant man . - There is ... a pregnant man . He 's having a baby , Edward . I swear it . You 're fired . - Why are we stopping on two ? - lt 's a surprise . - l prepped the operating room upstairs . - Good . You did good . - Are they here yet ? - Oh , thank God . Not yet . Who 's here ? Angela , enough with the huffing ' . We 're all alone . Imagine a tranquil- - Little birdies . - ln here ! In here ! - Cheep , cheep . - Forget the birdies . - Thank God ! Are you okay ? - Up , Angela , out of there . - Larry , what is this ? - lt 's our patient . - What 's the matter with him ? My best guess , his baby 's tangled in the large intestine . - His baby ? His ba- - - Hurry ! - His baby ? Oh , God ! - Yes . - ls the room prepped ? - Yeah , it 's prepped . Go on , Louise , open the door ! Relax . Just relax . Get him undressed ! Look at the belly on that guy ! - Please , let me do something ! - Look , look . This is dangerous , both for Alex and the baby . I don 't know what 's gonna happen . There 's nothin ' you can do . Just go outside with Angela , okay ? Keep her company . All right . All right ? What ? - Not you ? Not now ? No . - Yes , yes . - l 'll get someone . - l want Larry ! I want Larry ! Be- - Easy , easy . Okay , look , um- - Let 's imagine a garden with trees and birds cheeping . Cheep , cheep , cheep- - Let 's imagine drugs . - What can I do ? - Have the baby for me . - Feel that ? - What ? - Feel that ? No ? - No . Well , the drugs are working . We gave you an epidural . You 're gonna be awake through this , Alex. lt 's safer that way . Just try and stay calm . Okay . Here we go . Just relax . Think about the baby . Okay ? - Blot , blot . - Blot . - l 'm gonna cut right here . - That 's good . Very good . That 's good. I 'm not leaving you . - l 'm not leaving . Hold on. I 'm gonna ... - Oh , God ! - check . - Oh , this is hard . Oh , this is hard . - Where are you ? - l 'm here. I 'm here . Do you think he 's all right ? Okay . That 's good .

He sent me a dozen roses and an autographed picture with the band ! All right , breathe , honey . Just breathe . - Prepare number two . - You want an epidural ? - You want natural childbirth ? - l want drugs ! I want drugs ! We 've got a little baby girl . Look at her . You did it . Isn 't she gorgeous ? - Daddy loves you . - l can 't believe you did it . Oh , hello . Hello , little one . Oh , she 's beautiful ! Hello . I 'm so proud of you . Hello. I 'm your mum . Just a little bit more . It 's a boy ! - ls he okay ? - Oh , yeah , ten fingers . Ten toes . Okay , he 'll be right there . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That 's your mommy . Look at that baby .

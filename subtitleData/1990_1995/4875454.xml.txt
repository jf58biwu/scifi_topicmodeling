 Last week on Wild Palms : - What the hell is all this ? - Your marriage was arranged . Coty isn 't your son . Grace . Grace ! I 'm going to do some cutting now , okay ? Now we have begun . No ! - Hiro 's coming . - Hiro ? Escaping ! - You knew my father ? - No . But the senator did . Tell me your secrets . And Tara will be free . No ! No ! What is that , Grace ? ! Come on ! Hello . Hello . Well , well , the illustrated man . Come on , let 's have a look . Thing of beauty ! - What 's it all about ? - Ushio . Your tattoo artist . He took something from us . We offered him money to get the stolen goods back , it wasn 't enough . He marked you because he knew I 'd be annoyed . Which I am . But don 't worry , Harry . All is well . I saw Eli Levitt last week . He said you knew my father . Indeed , I did . And he was the real thing . The Chickie of his day . Old Dex was legendary for two things . The purity of his LSD and the fact that he was never seen in public without a tie . Your father wanted to use computers to free the brain from the body . Now , this was the ' 70s . There wasn 't even video . The critics dismissed him as an acid casualty . Which he was . What happened ? Blew his face off with a shotgun . Because of the recoil the coroner determined that that the first shot was not fatal . Ten minutes later , Dex finished the job . And I have always wondered what went through his mind those last 10 minutes . - How 's my Houdini ? - A little shaky . Some escape you pulled . Chickie taught you good stuff , huh ? My head hurts . They gave me something in jail . Mimezine . I 'm okay . Only thing is that I seem to see cathedrals . Cathedrals ? Yeah . That 's the main side effect of the drug so far . I mean , I really see them . Well , next time you do , just look . Don 't go inside and pray . Tully , I 'm sorry about your eyes . I got your back . That 's all that counts . I can 't believe it , I finally got the beach house . - Sensational . - And all because of the senator . Two million and change . Everything we always wanted , Grace , and this is just the beginning . Hey , are you okay ? - They 're buying you . - What ? - Can 't you see what 's happening ? - Wait a minute . - You wanted this too , remember ? - I don 't know you anymore . Yeah , well , that makes two of us . Why didn 't you tell me Eli Levitt was your father ? - I couldn 't . - Well , that 's sort of strange , isn 't it ? I mean , we 're married 12 years and you 'd lie about something like that . What else are you lying about ? I didn 't want to bring you into it . I thought they 'd leave us alone . They ? They who , the mafia ? What , did I marry into the mob , Grace ? I don 't know who to believe . What to believe . You sit here with your 18th nervous breakdown . Oh , me with my nervous - One day in the middle of Church Windows we 'll find out our country no longer belongs to us and nobody will care ! Conspiracy from hell . You know what ? There is a conspiracy against all of us . Either run to the hills with your tail between your legs or you stick it out and fight for the beach house ! - Spoken like a true New Realist . - And what 's wrong with that ? Well , for one thing , your son is a murderer and you stand here giving media lectures . My son is a murderer ? Who 'd he kill , Grace ? Rocky and Bullwinkle ? Gavin Whitehope . - Church Windows ? - Whose Church ? The Church of Mimecom and the New Realists . Connect the dots , people . In Senator Kreutzer 's constitution , the church and state are one . Read that , it 's very important . Wanna kneel down at the Church of Mimecom ? Miss , can you tell me the time ? You want Senator Kreutzer telling you how to live ? Hiro ? Save your kids , save yourself . Come on , people . Remember the Star Trek thing we did ? You know , Spock and Kirk at the S M bar . - Beat me up , Scotty ! - Beat me up , Scotty ! Sometimes I feel like I dreamed Japan . Everyone in it . How 's your father ? He died four years ago . In Tokyo 's version of the Resort . We can call them satoriums . Our best people seem to vanish into thin air . They 're in the temples now . Synthiotics , in the temples . I 'm caught , Hiro . I 'm stung me and I can 't move . See my bracelets ? There is a way out , Grace . You 've got to talk to Harry . You know the danger he 's in . You 're the only one he 'll listen to . They 've got their hooks in him . Try . Now , pull yourself together . If he doesn 't listen , then you run . To where , Hiro ? Where are we all going to run ? To paradise ? Mr. Levitt ? I 'm Elijah Whitehope . I 'm Gavin 's son . They murdered my father . I wanna help you . Chocolate cookies . Tell them Josie brought them to you . They 're laced with Mimezine . Honey , I 'm home . What 's going on ? I heard a scream . I fell asleep and had a nightmare ... You can go . How was the game ? I need a new handicap . I know just how you feel . Hey , Cookie Monster . Josie brought them . Cookies from Josie ? That 's enough to make anybody scream . When are they gonna let me go , Chap ? Soon as you give him the Go-chip . It doesn 't exist , Chap . It 's a fiction . - Just like Tara , huh ? - Tara 's real . Maybe she 's just like a song . I mean , where does a song go when you 're not singing it ? That 's one for the philosophers . Wait , wait , wait . I made something for you on keyboard . It 's a custom program . - Not tonight , I got a headache . - Oh , come on , Chap . I worked really hard on it . What we do for love . I 'm a good whore , go where I 'm kicked . And you ought to do the same . This better be good . Puppy dog ... What a lurid little dive . Puppy dog , you disappoint me . Five , six , seven , eight ... Hi , I 'm Tara . So good to finally meet you . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't wanna kill anybody . Why don 't you leave Tara alone ? All of you . Just leave Tara alone . Oh , I can 't stop thinking about that Miss Alabama . That kiss . Sex is the monster in the box . Major research area . We just don 't talk about it . Love among consenting holograms . I have a little surprise for you , Harry . I found an old photo of your father . You 're kidding . What you 're about to see is a 3-D animated rendering with texture mapping and full-motion algorithms . That 's easy for you to say . It 's only a 30-second program . Not very elaborate . This is my father ? Looks more like Dex than Dex did . Harry , my son . No . The voice is a little hinky . We kluged it from a game show host . It is an honest ghost that , let me tell you . Hamlet . My idea . That 's really in poor taste , Tony . - He keeps staring at me . - It ends with a hug . Come on . - Come on , don 't be shy . Come on . - No , that 's enough . Go ahead . Storm the memory palace . Today is the first day of the rest of your wife . Hiro . What happened ? Your father escaped last night . Can you take me to him ? Hello , Grace . It 's good to see you here after all these years . It 's not safe here , Grace . There is no safe anymore . You sent me away once . Never again . I can 't stay in their world anymore . - I know , baby . I know . - They took my son . I know that now . I 'm not going back . I 'm glad you 're here . It 's showtime . Ladies and gentlemen , Tully and Stitch in the Honeymooners . Hey , Josie . Tommy and Eli have escaped . I 'm so scared . What are we gonna do ? Well , honey , just take a deep breath and repeat after me . Everything must go . Everything must go . Tara is going to suffer for your cruelties . They sent a virus after your fragile black paramour . It will catch her and eat her . Just like a Grimm 's fairy tale . Here . Take a look . I 'm here . It 's all right . Napping . Had a nightmare . It 's always the same . Always . Always the same . Daddy ... Daddy ... There 's nothing there . Only dunes . And he hands me a shovel . I 'm only a boy and it 's hard to dig the sand . And he grabs the shovel ... In seconds he digs a great pit . And he orders me in . Then I climb into the pit . Don 't think about it anymore . Paige ... Will I ever leave this earth ? Yes . Yes . Chickie Levitt is a legless little liar . And he 's holding out on me . It 's a fiasco of red herrings . They 're alchemists , Paige . Ushio and his 47 Ronin . Do you know what infinity is to them ? It 's a cologne you dab behind the ears . It 's that easy . They know what to do with the memories of old men . Tony , you have a fever . No , no , no . Don 't humor me . They 'll be coming after me now . Tommy and that Lord of the Flies Eli Levitt . Come here , Paige . Come closer . I 'm gonna put the tape on now . Do you mind ? What 's the matter ? I 'm tired , that 's all . Well , here . A little Mimezine will pick you up . You 're sick . It 's Harry . You 're in love with him , aren 't you ? I 'm not in love with anyone . I don 't even know what the word means . You fixed all that . Happy ? Sorry to bother you . I was just having a drink . I was just in the neighborhood and there was a pile-up down the road . There was bodies all over the place I was just wondering maybe if I could use your phone , freshen up , have a drink or something . Still mad at me ? Look , I know I was rough on you in Kyoto . But I was angry . I 'm over it . I want to patch things up . It 's - It 's not that . I 'm glad you came . I 'm just feeling sorry for myself , that 's all . Oh , that is such a turn-on to me . - Mind if I join you ? - Drink ? Yes . What are you feeling sorry about ? Well ... My marriage is in shambles . My wife thinks I 've become this off-the-wall cultist seduced by money and power . Is she right ? The thought 's crossed my mind . What else you feeling sorry about ? Well , let 's see . Never got to know my daddy . My hairline 's receding . Nobody likes my beach house . - Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . - Got funny tattoos . Your turn . Apart from being scared all the time ? I wake up at night and I can 't breathe . Let 's get out of here . Where ? Oh , I don 't know . Someplace we can get a few laughs . We deserve that . Good evening . - Right this way . - Where 'd you hear about this place ? I 'm a cross-dresser . Thank you . So did the senator talk about my father ? No , he told me you had a conversation . Hey , do you think he 's crazy ? A little . You know what he said to me ? He said he was running for president . And he wanted me to be in his Cabinet . Just draw the line when he asks you to wear the pink pillbox hat . I don 't know , he said he 's harnessed the soul and locked it inside a household shrine ... - ... the television set . - You 've seen him on Laugh Attack . Put your hands together for the very strange very bitter comedy stylings of Stitch Walken ! All right , so I 'm drinking . How very unprofessional of me . Sorry , I got pressures . I 'm only human , okay . See , see ? This ain 't some guest shot on Church Windows . Let 's get into some trouble tonight . Let 's talk about ... Senator Tony Kreutzer . He of the New Reality and the messiah complex . Sieg heil ! Sieg hologram ! Sieg Mimecom ! This is a scary guy , This Tony K. This senator person . I 'm telling you . Read any of his books ? Pretty bad , even for sci-fi . All about old white guys who think they 're god . Ring a bell , people ? Hey , where are you going ? Don 't go . This is very important . We elected this guy , this is what I don 't understand . He kills people . We 're letting him ! These things called Perceptories . They aren 't hospitals . - Harry let 's go . - No , no . I want to hear this . Tully Woiwode , the artist ? Remember him ? He had a beautiful sister , man . Had a beautiful sister . She 's gorgeous . They blew her head off in Griffith Park . Hey , let go of me , man . Let 's get out of here . - Harry . - Paige . - Hey , Paige ! Where are you ? - Wait . Wait ! - Harry . Harry ! - Paige ! Paige ! All right , you . Up against the wall . What is going on ? Who are you , police ? I 'm an attorney . - Hey , look at this . - What ? You see his hand ? He 's a Father . Why didn 't you say ? Stay fresh and tingly with Summer Storm . And now , back to WC Saturday night at the movies ... Hey , what 's the matter , little man ? Mommy left with a Japanese man . She what ? When ? She said I wasn 't her son , that I was bad that I killed that fat man with a knife . Where 's Deirdre ? They took her . Dad , I 'm scared . Come here . Look , Mommy 's sick . She doesn 't mean the things she says . I 'm here , now , Coty . Dad 's here . Everything 's gonna be okay . I love you , Dad . Yeah , I love you too . I 'm sorry I called you so early . That 's all right , Harry . What 's going on . Have you heard from her ? No . Josie 's just left with Coty . He said she was with a man . You know , maybe she 's been seeing someone else all along . Who could blame her . I didn 't tell you what happened last night . I was in this club with Paige . And there was this raid of some kind . And these cops or whatever the hell they were they grab me and then when they saw the tattoo , they released me . Harry , wait a minute . No , they just let me go . Like I was one of them . Grace is unstable . She 's taken your daughter . And you 're talking about nightclubs . It 's crazy , I know . Harry , you 've got to go to the police . Police ? There 's no police . Maybe it 's the other way around . Maybe there 's nothing but police . - I gotta go . - Harry . Harry ! I want Chickie moved . To where ? Anywhere . Just do it . And I 'm leaving it to you to find Grace . It 's a little late in the day to have your neurotic daughter gum up the works . I have got to stop eating . I look like Cass Elliot . Earth to Paige . Any general insights to share with the group ? No . None . Sorry . You went to the club with Harry . Any good jokes ? I 'm not a real big fan of comedy . She wasn 't paying attention . Too busy drooling over Harry . You 're really pathetic . Don 't you ever talk to me that way , do you understand ? Ever ! She 's the only one who can really get to him . I guess that 's the way it should be . In a few weeks , I 'll be announcing my candidacy for president . On Monday , the Wild Palms Group will issue a terse press release . And it will read : Senator Tony Kreutzer of California has announced his engagement and imminent marriage to longtime aide , Paige Katz . Let us pray . The wind is old and still at play While I must hurry upon my way And I am running to Paradise Very much . Thank you very much . Synthiotics is all things to all ... - I 'm so glad you could come . - The senator had a great notion . People like you and me might need help to finding the garden so he 's built us this wonderful church . So we 'd like to invite you to join us . Yes , this was his second . I 'm a survivor of the disaster of Boca Raton . - That 's all I have . - Thank you . Bless you , sir . - Tommy ? - Act like you 're being hassled . Tommy , what 's going on ? - Grace and Deirdre are fine . - Where are they ? I can 't tell you that . Meet me Sunday at noon , Court of Psalms . The cemetery . - Are you all right , you need money ? - No . Thanks , old friend . Remember those stories about me robbing people 's houses when we were kids ? - Yeah , you only stole the mirrors . - I 'm putting them all back now . Flowers for you , Harry . A bouquet of looking glasses . So see what you see . For old times . Paige . Don 't look at me . What are you doing here ? I need to talk . I 'm listening . The senator entered politics in the late ' 70s . Back then , my father was a well-respected journalist . To him the senator was a dangerous man a demagogue . He wrote a series of articles tying Kreutzer and Synthiotics to a shadowy vigilante group . It cost the senator the election . Men broke into our house and they took me away . I was 3 years old . The Fathers . I never saw my parents again . And I was raised in New Realist foster homes . Everything you 've told me your lost little boy . Lies . Why , Paige ? To pull you in . Are you with him now ? Before in college , when we first met . They were grooming me to be his wife even then . He was jealous of you that 's why they sent me away . That 's why they brought Grace in . What are you saying ? Your marriage was arranged . Two royal families . Josie is the senator 's sister . Why did you do this to me ? They did it . Is Coty my son ? What they did to that poor little boy . What they did . Is Coty my son , Paige ? Answer me . I am wading through blood , Harry . I 'm drowning . - Who is he ? Answer me , Paige ! - God help me ! Answer me , Paige ! Come on ! He 's mine ! I had him with the senator ! He was switched with your baby at birth ! Stolen ! The way they stole my life ! Harry ! This is a surprise . - Where 's Coty ? - Napping . Down below . I need to see him . To look in his eyes . To see if it 's true . I hate resorting to cliché , but you look like you saw a ghost . I did . Paige Katz . You know , Harry ? The women in your life are really going to hell . - And you 're driving the bus ! - Don 't get righteous with me . Not now ! You begged for this life . You wanted this life . Did you think there wasn 't a price to pay ? Did you think it 's just about beach houses and Hockney lithographs ? About fooling around on your wife ? Is that what you thought , Harry ? She tried to warn me all along . She said ... - ... he wasn 't ours . - Oh , she 'll say anything ! I didn 't want you to marry her . That was the senator 's idea . Because of that marriage , you are going to be an historical figure ... - ... a rich one , at that . - I need to see Coty . Hey . Get off him ! I said , get off him ! Go on down , Harry . Go below . Because nothing matters . You 're with us now . The palm at the end of the mind Beyond the last thought , rises In the bronze décor A gold-feathered bird Sings in the palm Without human meaning Without human feeling A foreign song Tommy , are you here ? Tommy ? Father . Tourists like to come here . They 're real morbid . It 's worse than The Day of the Locust . - You never told me your name . - It 's Peter . I know yours . - Where do you live ? - In the tunnels . I 'll take you to Tommy . We 're hitting the Yellow Brick Road , Harry . What do you need ? A heart ? A brain ? Courage ? I 'll take a helping of each . Hello , Josie . Hello , Eli . I missed you . So did a lot of other people . I 'm truly sorry . Sit down . I thought it was time to make amends . I never stopped loving you . Sounds a little like a Channel 3 soap , no ? I expect you to be bitter . What largesse . Ten years locked up , Josie . You murdered my wife , robbed me of my child - She wasn 't your wife . That was bigamy . We were never legally divorced . So , what do we do now , Josie ? Settle in the suburbs and barbecue by the pool ? Fly to Vegas and get hitched like Elvis and Priscilla . Why the reunion , Josie ? I 'll tell you why . Because I am parched . My brother loves the desert , not I. I want the flood . To touch you to taste you to smell you to start the holy war all over again . Release Chickie , or there 's nothing to talk about . I 'll give you Chickie for Grace . You 're no general ! You 're a mercenary . A cannibal . A pimp with the wings of a bat ! I never wanted you . Any part of you ! Go down , Harry . Through the deep end . That 's where you 'll find her . Deirdre ! I missed you so much , baby . Forgive me , Grace . It doesn 't matter . - Now that you 're here . - He thought it was just a dream . I told you one day you 'd wake up at the watering hole . Tomorrow we 're going to the desert . We 're gonna set the palms on fire . We found her in the pool . We were about to flood . - Was she alone ? - We 're checking the perimeters . How 'd you find us ? The boy gave me a map . I smell Paige Katz . Unmistakable . The smell of sea breeze , skunk and death . They moved your son . The senator knows your plans . He moved Chickie from the desert to a safe house in Hollywood the place they killed Gavin Whitehope . Liar . She 's lying . The bride of Frankenstein , a liar ? Say it isn 't so . I 'm telling the truth ! What do you think , Harry ? Is she telling the truth ? I believe her . There 's more . At 4 : 00 the senator 's going to see your son . He thinks Chickie has some kind of techno-shamanistic key to eternity . Kreutzer said that he 'd tear the secret from Chickie 's bones , if he had to . In less than an hour . You will take us to this safe house , Miss Katz . And if I do not leave with my son , we will surely gut you in the street . I 'm going with you . No , Harry go to the senator . You haven 't seen him since that business on the yacht with Coty . He 's probably worried about your allegiance . Renew it . Keep him from his appointment with my son . He 'll bring too many with him . We won 't stand a chance . Be our Trojan horse , Harry . And remember , there are no politics . Only fathers and beach houses . It 's the Mimezine . Maybe you should stay . No way . It 's not gonna happen . We 're going to get Chickie . Grace , I 'm sorry for everything . Look , Eli says the tunnels aren 't safe . Take Deirdre to the house . They won 't think of looking for you there . I 'll come tonight . Flood the pool ! We 're moving out ! Come on . Okay . Breath slowly now . Just relax . It 'll be all right . You now what I love ? I love the men who slash paintings of the old masters . See the palms out there , Harry ? Shivering in the blue skies . The simple mysticism of a windy day . You know what I told the senator ? I said , " Today is a day for unicorns . " You were good to me . But I 'm not that boy anymore . Those Father Knows Best days are over . Only Fathers know best . And there are so many enemies on the way to the garden . It 's all right , Chickie . We 'll take you to the beach . Tara ? Tara ? - It 's Daddy , it 's Daddy . - Come on , Eli . He 's dying . We gonna take you to the water . Can you hold on ? Hold on ! Come on ! Come on ! Hurry ! Where 's Tommy ? Come on , let 's go ! Come on ! - Stitch ! Come on , move it ! Move ! - You can 't leave him ! - We gotta go back for him ! - Shut up , Tommy ! Everyone , shut up ! Hurry ! Here we are , baby boy . See ? We 're at the water . - Is this real ? - Yeah . Remember how Mama always brought you to the ocean when you got sick ? Where 's the orchestra ? Orchestra ? I hear a symphony . Chickie ! Chickie ! Grace ? Oh , no ! Now , where are you Grace ? Grace ! Hate to say it , but I like him so much better since he died . That posthumous quality really makes me shiver . They 're gonna bring the girl in . He 's waiting for you . Hi , Deirdre ! Come here . It 's Auntie Tabba . Come here . Any problems ? - No . - What sweetness you are . What sweetness . Will you need me for anything else ? No . Good night , Tobias . And thank you .

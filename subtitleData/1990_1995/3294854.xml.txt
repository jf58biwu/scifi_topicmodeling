( Reporters Shouting Questions ) Mr. President , should the rise in unemployment be taken as a precursor to future economic instability ? Uh ... Will you be playing sax on Arsenio 's anniversary special ? Uh ... as Chess Club President , my motto is , " Update ... computerize ... " I 'm sorry , but the President will be answering questions at a later date . This is strictly a photo opportunity . Is it true the President is using a non-F.D.A. approved pimple medication ? - Mom ! - I 'm very upset . I know you are . You have every right to be . I 've told the press not to trample my rose bushes . Talk to them . They might listen to you . You 're the President . This has got to be a dream . No dream . You are the President . This is excellent . Check it out . What ? No , I don 't think so . Hold on . Let me check . You don 't want to schedule - any missile strikes , do you ? - What are you doing ? No !

" ... neither shall any person be eligible to that coffee who shall not have attained to the age of 35 ... dog years . " What ? Let me see that ! This is great ! With you as President and me as V.P. running the country will be a blast .

You can order pizza any time you want . You can promote peace throughout the world . You can get babes like that ... Man , I wish I were you . I can have Brad Langtree booted out of Chess Club ! The world trade tower situation was a wake-up call to all at the bureau . I 've been tracking a number of fringe groups and in fact we had planted an agent at the hertz rent-a-car counter who , if he had not been on a coffee break ... So , are we going to be able to take care of Brad ? - See that guy ? - Director of the F.B.I. he 's got his top dogs hangling it . Very discreet . F.B.I ... . great . And who are all these other guys ? Clockwise , your secretaries of labor commerce , treasury , the attorney general ... - ( Vacuum Starts ) - The important thing is that we not be caught unawares again ... Mom ! Do you mind ? We 're trying to run the country here . I 'll be done in a jiffy . Oh , and tell your friends that there are oatmeal scotchies and vodka tonics in the kitchen . As I was saying , the threat of terrorist attacks within the country heretofore have been seemingly non-existent ... Uh , sorry . Excuse me one sec ? I was talking to Gary here about , you know , Brad Langtree ... That matter has been taken care of , Mr. President . Oh , good . Great . Thanks . Findings in South America indicate ...

Well , at least I didn 't drop my baton . Hey , can we all just get along ? Look ... we brought you gifts . Diamond broach thingies . My buddolas in opec assured me they 're worth a bundle , and I have one for each and every one of you . Opec ? Gary , you can 't keep cashing in favors . These diamonds ? A maserati ? You 're not even old enough to drive . If congress likes the rolexes I will be soon . Wyatt ? Gary ? We have a problem . True , I was upset at being replaced by Miss Puertoic but that in no way influenced my decision to come forward . For the record the F.B.I. framed Farber High freshman Brad Langtree and the man who issued that illegal directive is President Wyatt Donnelly . ( Reporters Asking Questions ) Glad I 'm not you .

Look at this : " President caught inlove nest with 15-year old . - She 's two months older than me ! - Easy , Wy , easy . All I wanted was to be President of the Chess Club . Now the american public hates my guts . And Mom will kill me when she sees how the tobacco lobbyists trashed the rec room . This isn 't about defeat . It 's about damage control . All we have to do is pull you out of this popularity pit and we 'll be fine . I know ! Wyatt can initiate and across-the-broad tax cut . Or judge a dog show ! People love people who love animals . No . We 'll launch a winnable war . Kick a little international butt and your popularity 's history . A winnable way ? On who ? - How about Puerto Rico ? - Bitch . This isn 't the way out , Gary . The TV reports were all true . - I 'm guilty . - This is politics , remember ? Cabinet members Gary- - This meeting is adjourned . The President will be late for american history . Forget history ! We have a situation here . So the President will be late for class . What are they going to do to the President ? Normally , being late for class means mandatory detention . But seeing as you are commander in chief I 'm willing to let things slide . No . I don 't want any special treatment . I 'm just a citizen . God bless america . That 's why that man is President . Welcome to Compu-Chess . Shall we play . And you thought you could run the Chess Club ? You can 't even run the United States . Yeah ?

You really are a better chess player than me . No duh . But you 're still a wanker . And Chess Club President . Still ... you may have something with this computer idea . It 's true . I had Brad Langtree framed . And for no better reason that I was , you know jealous , I guess . So what I 'm trying to say is I 'm guilty wa charged and I 'm really sorry . So I 'm resigning as your President . My last act is to pardon Chess Club President , Brad Langtree . Thank you . God bless america . Cut it . GARY : No ! It isn 't over . I 'm telling you- - A midnight strike on Canada and this is yesterday 's news . That was really nice , very presidential . I 'm proud of you . Thanks . But all I wanted was to be President of the Chess Club . Wyatt , life is short . Get over it . Hey , if Wyatt 's out of the picture that makes me President ! President Gary here . Prepare the presidential yacht . And tell Miss Hawaii to bring my cocoa butter . Hurry ! Aw , man . What a rip . Yesterday , we were the most powerful men in the country . Today , we can 't even buy beer . So much for Wyatt Donnelly 43rd President of the United States . It would have been kind of cool to read about myself someday in history class . Well , there are other ways to be remembered . Captioned by Grantman Brown

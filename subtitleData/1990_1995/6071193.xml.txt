 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ music continues ] ( man on radio ) 'All the news , all the time . It 's 5 : 00 p.m . ' 'Headlines at this hour . ' 'Capitol City , last night , Superboy foiled an attempted 'bombing of City Hall by the super terrorist 'who calls himself Chaos . ' 'This is the tenth such incident in the last two weeks . ' Oh , honey . ( Bizarro ) 'Yes , dear . ' Breakfast is ready . ( man on radio ) ' .. all engineered to create panic and confusion . ' 'Chaos , once again , avoided capture by Superboy . ' 'It 's 85 degrees at the Civic centre . ' 80 degrees at the airport . ' 'Coming up next , sports 'on Capitol City all news W.W.C.V.A. " [ dramatic music ] Good morning , dear . Mmm , yum . Smell good . Mmm . Just way me like them . Mmm . Best coffee in whole world . - Burned enough for you ? - Mmm . Perfect . No breakfast for Bizarro Lana ? Bizarro Lana not hungry . Mmm , honey pie am sick ? No . No . Me just feel a little .. [ sizzling ] What am wrong ? What am wrong ? - Ah , oh ! - What am wrong ? No worry . Me get help . Me love you . Me always love you . [ dramatic music ] ( Matt ) 'That 's the best picture we 've got of him . ' - Chaos ? - Yeah . The name say 's it all . So far he 's set fire to the stock exchange 'kidnapped two aldermen and dumped hallucinogens' into the reservoir . What does he want ? Like I said , the name says it all . Why did the bureau get this guy 's file ? He 's a terrorist . Because he threatened Superboy . And we look into everything Superboy 's involved in . Right , Lana ? Here . See if you can find some kind of pattern . But you probably won 't . He 's pretty ... chaotic . - I 'll give you a hand . - That 's alright . - No , seriously , I wanna help . - It 's no big deal , Clark . It 's not like the guy 's an alien or Bigfoot . No , I 'm just curious . Probably for the same reason as you are . I doubt that . If it means so much to you here . - Thanks . - Thanks . Can you believe the air conditioning in this place ? Around here , I 'd believe anything . Matt wasn 't kidding when he said chaotic . Here 's a cottage that was blown up near route 423 . Until now Chaos has stayed in the city . May I see that ? I don 't think Chaos had anything to do with this one . [ intense music ] [ music continues ] Lana . Lana ! - Why she die ? - I don 't know . Something in the duplication process was unstable . - Maybe- - - Why she die ? They make me copy of you and me live . They make her copy of Lana and she die . Me freak . Monster . Me should be dead , like her . No ! There 's always hope . Me ... want to die . Come with me ... to hope . ( Danielle ) 'Increase his intelligence . ' 'Integrate him into human society . ' Well , you 've set me quite a challenge , Superboy . This is the best research lab in the world , Dr. Lynn . If you can 't help us .. Well , I didn 't say that I couldn 't help you . 'The cosmetic part should be easy . ' We 've been working with synthetic skin that we could graft on to him . But the mental .. No use . Me , I 'm hopeless . You let me be the judge of that . Since he was created from you , you 're the key . There 's a device I 've been working on . Based on brain wave transferral . Bio rhythmic transfusions . We haven 't dared risk it on humans . But super humans .. There 'll be side effects . Bizarro 's super powers will be negated . He will be , to all intent and purposes , human . But , you , as the donor , we have no way of knowing 'how you 'll be affected . ' I 'll take the chance . No . Why you do this ? Dangerous . Why you risk life for Bizarro ? You were made from me You 're a part of me . How can I turn my back on my brother ? You am good friend . You am too . [ intense music ] ( Chaos ) 'Life is random , meaningless . ' Creation is a cruel and pointless joke . We struggle to superimpose , plan and purpose on a universe that 's totally devoid of plan and purpose . Can 't you see what a waste that is ? Can 't you see how important my mission is ? I 've gotta make you all understand and I 'll keep at it till you do . Whenever you least expect me , I 'll be there . I 'll do whatever it takes to get you to embrace the chaos . And nobody , not the police , not even Superboy will be able to stop me . Remember the words of William Butler Yeats , my friends . " Things fall apart . The center will not hold . " [ intense music ] That 's it , gentlemen . Ready ? [ intense music ] [ music continues ] [ buzzer beeping ] [ explosions ] [ glass shattering ] - Mmm , Pain . Me am in pain . - It 's alright . Make pain stop . - Superboy . - I 'm alright . What happened ? Bizarro 's structure is more unstable than our test indicated . His biofeedback has overloaded the circuitry . Anybody got any aspirin ? My head is killing me . This is amazing . Words . Words have meaning . I read , and in here , I have ideas . I can 't believe what I 'm thinking and feeling . Superboy , Dr. Lynn , how can I ever thank you for what you 've given me ? You can thank us later . Got a lot of work ahead of us . This is just the beginning . You 've absorbed a massive information from Superboy 's brain . But it 's jumbled , chaotic . It has to be ordered , digested and understood . And you won 't be needing me for that . I 'll always need you , my brother . I 'll be checking in doctor . Is everything alright with you ? Any side effects ? Just a little dizziness . Dizziness ? Nothing to worry about . I think it 's time to begin your education . Then we 'll get going on those skin grafts . [ intense music ] [ dramatic music ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] - Yes ? - It 's me . - Me who ? - Don 't you recognize me ? - Brother . - Bizarro ! This is incredible . Look at you . How 'd you find me ? In the transfer room . Along with all the information I picked up fragments of your memories , your feelings , where you are who you are , I just know . Don 't worry , I could never betray you . It 's just that I never share my secret with .. - Lana . - Hi , Clark . Clark , aren 't you gonna introduce me to your friend ? - Hi , Lana Lang . - Bill . - Zarro . - Bill Zarro , that 's right . Have we met before ? - Yes . - No . No , absolutely not . Well , it 's a pleasure to meet you , Bill . And I hope to see you again . Well , I better go . I don 't want to be late for school . - I 'll be checking in on you . - ' See ya . ' So where did he come from ? I thought I knew all your friends . Lana , what would Superboy think ? Clark , it 's not like that . In a funny way , there 's something about him that reminds me of Superboy . Clark . Are you alright ? I just need a little air . [ intense music ] [ music intensifies ] Chaos ! Chaos is all that exists . The only reality is chaos . [ people screaming ] You , you think you got it together ? You 're falling apart . From the moment you 've been born you begin dying . [ tires screeching ] Ah , finally you arrive . Here 's one from Chaos . [ explosion ] [ dramatic music ] [ melancholic music ] - Danielle . - I put it out this morning . I thought it was time you knew . - Who ? - My son , Allen . He died in a war I didn 't believe in . - Your son , you gave me- - - I hope you don 't mind . Mind ? I 'm honored . I just .. What is it ? For a moment it seemed like ... it was nothing . [ dramatic music ] [ tires screeching ] Interesting . A little blast shouldn 't have done more than distract you . My point exactly . Things fall apart . Even Superboy .

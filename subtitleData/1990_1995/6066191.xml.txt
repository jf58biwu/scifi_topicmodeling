 [ theme music ] ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learnt he possessed the strength of steel . The speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . A clean city is a happy city . Yeah . Hi . Hello . ( all ) Hi . Oh . A double dip , please . I don 't usually indulge but it 's Sunday . [ dramatic music ] How long does it take to scoop an ice-cream ? Keep a smile in your heart . You never know when you 'll need one . Hey , you . ( female # 1 ) 'No ! My baby . ' [ music continues ] Who did this ? [ humming ] One scoop or two ? You see today 's paper ? Another person went berserk . This time , a priest . Something weird is definitely going on in this city . What kind of city would it be , if it wasn 't ? Are you okay ? Did you have an accident or something ? No , why ? Is not the same dress you left in last night ? Well , we went out dancing and ... watch the sun come up . That 's about it . - You and Adam ? - Mm-hmm . Could I get a packet of gum , Ernie ? ( Clark ) 'You spend a lot of time together . ' Hey , lighten up , Clark . How often does a girl get to date the city 's wealthiest most eligible bachelor ? Do you see this ? This priest shoved these babies in the street . Superboy saved them . Pretty incredible , huh ? Clark , I haven 't betrayed Superboy . There she is . As the only surviving victim of Tommy Puck 's rampage of terror what are your reactions to this morning 's news ? - What news ? - ' You , spoken with Superboy ? ' He must be furious , the man who taunted him for weeks 'while he tried to find him . ' 'Then nearly killed him , will be free . ' What are you talking about ? Tommy Puck . He 's just been given a full pardon . He 's been released from prison this morning , a free man . - No . - ' Is that all you have to say ? ' You were surrounded by death for nearly a week . 'Tracked by a maniacal mad scientist . ' Isn 't there something about the man that left an impression ? Please , I-I can 't talk right now . ( female # 2 ) 'You watched , as he tortured those people . ' 'Mercilessly probing their brains with electrodes . ' 'Performing experiments only his twisted mind 'could understand . ' 'The public wants to know , what kind of man could do that ? ' Okay , Puck , paperwork 's all done . You 're free . Don 't know how you did it , Tommy . But let 's get out of here , before they figure it out . - What are you up to ? - Nothing . Why would they give you a pardon ? Because ... I 'm dying . ( Superboy ) 'So what happened , Puck ? ' Well , they offered to reconsider my sentence if I took part in an experiment . And you know how I love a good experiment . What kind of experiment ? Superboy . [ indistinct chattering ] We injected him with a deadly virus . Then we gave him an experimental antidote . Didn 't work . It 's tragic . But who knows how many lives will benefit from his sacrifice . But still , how can they let him to walk the streets after what he 's done to all those people . I spend lot of time with Tommy . Trying to figure him out . He was a brilliant scientist . But his fascination with death proved to be his downfall . Other people 's death . Apparently the thought of his own has changed that . I think you 'll find he 's the same man , you once knew . Well , thanks for everything . Sorry , if I caused you any trouble . I 'm gonna keep an eye on him . Good . He 's gonna need it . I 'm afraid that this time he may not be entirely prepared 'for the harsh realities of this world . ' Bye , guys . You did it , Tommy . You fooled them . So what 's next ? Are we gonna round up a few more guinea pigs ? What 's the plan ? I 'm going to make amends . I just don 't understand . How could they let him go ? It 's a bureaucracy . Anything can happen . You weren 't there , Matt . All those people he just tortured them just to study them . He did these horrible things to their brains with electricity . God , if it wasn 't for Superboy , I 'd be next . - Adam ? - Mm-hmm . You 're the envy of every woman in the city . Enjoy it . Looks like it 's getting serious . Someone 's paying me a little attention , is that so wrong ? How many nights do I have to sit home alone waiting ? Superboy knows where I am . Can 't wait forever . I didn 't mean anything by it , I 'm sorry . I don 't know what it is , I 've been cranky lately . I just want you to be happy for me . If you 're happy , I 'm happy . Now , what do you say , we get to work on that psycho priest . Okay . But I have to leave early this afternoon . Adam 's taking to me to the opening ceremony for the Centennial tonight . But you 're supposed to go with me . Oh , I 'm sorry , Clark , I forgot . But you understand , I mean , it 's a date . I understand . ( male # 1 ) 'And a big welcome for the Senator and Mrs. Volkum . ' [ indistinct chattering ] 'And here now is tonight 's guest of honor , Mr. Adam Verrel . ' Uh , isn 't that your cue ? Keep them waiting . Makes them think you 're more important . Adam , listen , I 'm really not used to things moving this fast . Frankly I 'm not used to things moving at all . - Sit back and enjoy the ride . - I can 't . Is this about Superboy ? Yeah . Well ... far be it for me to step on any toes especially Supertoes . Can you imagine spending the rest of your life with somebody who flies off to one emergency or another I mean , how on earth would you make dinner plans , my darling ? I don 't know . I don 't even know if he 's interested . Well , that should tell you something right there shouldn 't it , when I want a woman .. I make sure that she knows . Oh , Adam . I-I can 't accept this . No , please . You deserve beautiful things , my darling . [ crowd cheering ] Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . 'We are here tonight to begin a year of celebration . ' We 're also here to dedicate a vision . The vision of a man who 's selflessness is making for a better community , Mr. Adam Verrel . This is a man who was willing to put his money where his mouth is to offer us the possibility of a better tomorrow . To give us the message of hope . Happy birthday , Capitol City . Let 's work together and make this town a better place . With the placement of hundreds of these screens around our city . He has given us reminders of our responsibility to ourselves and to our fellow citizens . Join me now in a warm welcome . A Capitol City welcome for Mr. Adam Verrel . Thank you . Thank you , Mr. Mayor . You know , it 's the people of this town that make it all worthwhile . If Capitol City weren 't filled with people like you , then 'well I wouldn 't feel as strongly as I , as I do . ' I remember when I first came to Capitol City how I was treated . And now ... well , I wanna give something back . I 'm only giving Capitol City what I think it deserves . Take no prisoners . [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] Hand ' em up and move ' em all . [ dramatic music ] I warned you about voting for that proposal . I told you it would irritate me . Ms. Helser , hold it right there . Your coffee stinks . Aah ! What 's wrong with you ? Verrel vision . Good thoughts for good people . Think good thoughts . [ dramatic music ] [ indistinct chattering ] What 's going on ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Any idea what caused this ? I was hoping you 'd have some suggestions . Well it 's stress , isn 't it ? City life turns to bottle people up . That 's why I had the screens put up that , uh .. It reminds people of who they are . Uh , Superboy , this is Adam Verrel . - How do you do ? - My pleasure . Lana 's told me so much about you . - Has she ? - Indeed she has . However , I think you should keep your eyes on her otherwise she 's gonna be scooped out . Well , I guess that 's up to her . Listen , tomorrow afternoon we 're having a citizen 's award lunch and it 's part of the week long Centennial celebration I was wondering , could you come down and say a few words to Capitol City for us ? - I 'd be happy to . - Terrific . Beautiful necklace . It 's been my pleasure . - Oh , Superboy , wait . - What 's wrong ? Um , it 's nothing , I think I sprained my ankle . I think you should see a doctor . - I 'll take you . - I can drive her . No , really it 's okay . I insist . Superboy , we need you . We 've got another crazo . A housewife in a mini mall . What 's happening to this city ? Go ahead . I 'll make sure she gets to the hospital . I 'm sorry . Well , he 's incredible , isn 't he , all those powers . No wonder you 're so smitten . Sort of puts an ordinary man like me to shame . Doesn 't it ? Well , there 's something to be said for ordinary . [ dramatic music ] I knew you 'd come back to me . [ music continues ] [ dramatic music ] What do you mean you want out of the deal ? My priorities have changed , now that I 'm ... dying . Ah ! Well , it is death that makes life live gives it ... whatever significance . Robert Browning . I 've been thinking about it a lot . Nobody really knows what happens when you ... go . I mean , anything could be out there , even God . And what if just , what if that 's it . What if God is waiting for me ? Tommy , I think you are over reacting ? So , I mean you tortured people to death . - Forty seven . - Forty seven , Forty eight . Listen , the important thing is , Tommy that you 're putting that knowledge to work for us . No , the important thing is , I use the time that I have left to make amends . Tommy .. Do you know who you are talking to ? Don 't you remember that night that drunken stupor you were in and told me about experiments that you 'd like to make . And I offered to give you Capitol City as one giant .. ... lab rat . I no longer am interested in that . Oh , you no longer interested in that ? Tommy , we 're two of a kind . You like to experiment on people 's bodies I like to mess with their minds . Show them their true nature . That they are indeed scum of the earth . Together we are one hell of a team , Tommy . Will you just stop it , alright ? I don 't want to do that anymore . 'And the girl . ' 'Remember the girl , Tommy . ' The one you wanted to keep till last . And Superboy came and ruined everything . Do you remember her ? - Lana . - Lana . She 's yours . Keep your end of the bargain . I will get rid of Superboy . And all you have to do .. [ beeping ] ... is finish this . It 's all here . All your research into electrical brain emissions . All I need you to do , Tommy .. ... is intensify it . Will you do that ? Those people , the priest , the mayor . Yes , well I played around with it for a while but I 'm not a scientist , I 'm certainly not you , am I ? It was taking too long , Tommy . Now , do we have an agreement ? Or am I gonna have to get nasty ? Was there anything you did unusual the afternoon before the ceremony ? Anything that could have caused you to do what you did . Well , it was , uh .. It was a pretty normal day . And then , and one terrible ravaging moment everything turned sour . Superboy , there 's something on television you should see . I must speak with Superboy . There 's a terrible , a terrible evil in your midst . An evil that you must fight . It 's him . It 's him . He knew what I was gonna do and he stopped me . - I don 't know how he did it . - It is only a power failure . No , no . It 's him . He 's probably on his way here , right now . - What 's going on ? - Superboy . - What do you want ? - You 're in great danger . - From what ? - Not from what , from who . - Adam Verrel . - Adam Verrel ? And why should I believe you ? I gotta go . But you have to believe me . Anyone that comes in contact with him , is in terrible danger . Wait a minute . Lana ! There we go . What is this all about ? I mean , the people are going to be arriving soon . Well , this is a very special day for me , my darling . Something that I have waited for , for quite sometime . Why what 's so special about today ? You 'll see , darling . There we are . - Cheers . - Cheers . Superboy . Thank you so much for coming . Where 's Lana ? Why ? What 's wrong ? I just want to see that she 's safe . Well , of course , she 's safe . We wouldn 't want anything to happen to the future Mrs. Adam Verrel , now would we ? Mrs. Verrel ? Yes , it 's very exciting . She said , yes a few minutes ago . Where is she ? She 's back here . - Would you like me to show you ? - I 'll find her . Lana ! What happened ? I 'm so sorry . What did you do to her ? Get help ! Would you hurry up , I-I think he 's killed her . - Who ? - Superboy . I love you . I know . Put her down . I 've to get her to a hospital . I 'm a doctor . Bring her over here . Clear the table , please . She 's dead . No ! Let Hercules himself have his way . The cat will meow . And the dog will have his day . [ dramatic music ] [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

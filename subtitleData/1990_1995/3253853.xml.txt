 You were wonderful , Wyatt . Thank you . My first time , you know , Yeah . I know . There 's something I have to tell you . Even though both you and Gary created me I can 't help feeling That you 're ... . you 're ... - What ? - You pancakes and sausages are getting cold . MARCIA : Did you hear me , honey ? Your pancakes and sausages are getting cold ! What makes you think that was my first time ? - Hey , sleeping beauty ! - ( Door Opens ) Get your butt out of bed . Lewis 's dog paid us a visit last night . And after you 're done scooping the lawn , mow it . - Good morning . - Do I look any ... older today ? You always look older in the morning . - Happy birthday , Mom . - Thanks , honey . I don 't know , Gary . Calling up Lisa is dangerous . Yeah . But this time , we 're ready for her . No turning back now . Ahem ! You ladies seen have you seen it ? No . Sorry , Chett . Didin 't he see ? He 's an idiot . Here we go . ( Both Screaming ) DEMONIC VOICE : Who dares disturb my slumber ? I did not wish to be summoned . For this impertinence , you shall be punished ! ( Screaming ) Just kidding . Geez , boys , lighten up . I really missed you guys . Hey , you gave us tans . Thanks . What else can I do for you today ? We have a few simple requests if it 's okay with you . Anything you want : porsches , superhuman strength the combined knowledge of the ages . - What 's it going to be ? - We want to see you naked . - Gary , we can 't ask Lisa that . - Relax , Wyatt . I 'm yours to command . You digging this , Wyatt . A little . - What 's with the digital pasties ? - It 's for your protection . You boys created me to be your ideal woman . Unfortunately , this level of perfection doesn 't really exist . - Well , except maybe in beer commercials . - Point being ? It would ruin you for real women in the future . This is the best we can hope for in frontal nudity . Sorry . So much for wishes two through 12 . There must be something on that list I can help with . A birthday present for your mom . That I can do . Ask her to make a wish . When she opens the box , she 'll get it . She 'll get it . We create the ultimate magical being and the best she can do is save me a trip to K-mart isn 't there anything you 'd like to wish for , Wyatt ? CHETT : Hey ! Cud boy ! Pry your head out of your butt and hump down here A.S.A.P. ! I don 't think Chett had ever called me by my real name . I 'm sensing a wish here . Okay . Okay , I 've got one . I wish Chett 's lame insults would hurt him as much as they 've hurt me . - Yes . Consider it done . - Oh , sure . Grant his wishes . Found my knife . Know where ? On your breakfast tray lying atop the diseased remains ... of your sissy seven-grain toast . This is a weapon of death ! Not a butter knife you little freak show ! ( Screaming ) What 's so funny , sewer hole ? My head hurts ! ( Yelling ) Whoa ! - What the hell was that ? - What was what ? Nothing . I just need some aspirin . Stroganoff again ? What , did you buy a 50-gallon drum ? BOTH : Happy birthday ! Oh . What a wonderful surprise . Oh . Look , honey . Gary bought me a present . Oh , right . Your birthday . Don 't worry . I didn 't forget . There 's a sale this saturday . Saturday ? - Open my present , Mom . - Ohh . All right . - But before you do , make a wish . - Oh . That 's sweet . All righty . ( Emily Giggling ) Um ... it 's empty . - Empty ? How can it be empty ? - Did you make a wish ? It 's the thought that counts . I , uh ... I can keep button in this box . Who needs wishes ... when we have each other . - Right , Bellissima ? - Oh . You 're all that I could ever wish for , Al . I give my mom one little birthday wish and pow ! Next thing you know she 's doing wash-and-wipe with Mr. Muscle Boy . I knew something like this was going to happen . We never should have called Lisa . I think I did a great job . Who 'd have guessed your mom would turn out to be such a little horn dog ? Who is that clown ? Gary , that 's Supermodel Magnifico ! Romance novels , eefcake calendars . You know , the prince of pecs . My mom 's a fan and apparently , so is yours . - Oh , my , my my . - Lisa , get rid of him ! I can 't once you make a wish , it has to run its course . Magnifico could be around a day , a month , a year ... ooh ! Lucky girl . Your mother and I have decided to retire early . I have one more present for her . I think I 'm going to hurl . Gary , relax . As far as your mom 's concerned that is your dad . Only now he 's the loving husband your mom wished for . I 'm confused . Is there like a zipper on that body ? I mean , is Gary 's dad inside there ? No , he and Magnifico only switched places . Neither of them remembers his past life . Wherever your dad is , he 's doing just fine . Am I showing enough thigh ? You can never show enough thigh . Because I just got my cheeks waxed . And they look Magnifico . MAGNIFCIO : Good morning , my son . Did I wake you ? - Uh , well , as a matter of fact ... - My apologies . I just want you to know- - as I was cleaning dog poop off the lawn I was thinking how wonderful it is to have you as my son . I am so very proud of you . Uh-huh . What do you want ? - I have come to give you a surprise . - Did I miss it ? Not yet . Your mother and I have decid to remodel this room of yours . It was your father 's idea . Such a room does not befit the son of Al Wallace . You were meant to experience the finer things in life . Construction begins immediately . Gentlemen ? My son 's jacuzzi will go here . Do you approve ? - I love you , Dad . - I love you , Son . ANNOUNCER : Open wide and say " Ah " as Magnifico flexes the pecs all America dreams of oiling . Get out . Dog grooming hour is over . - Just need a second , Chett . - You 're done now , skank-boy . ( Screams ) What are you looking at ? - Your fly 's open , Chett . - What ? Holy monkeys ! You okay , Chett ? I just ... I need to lay down . What are you wearing ? Dad 's been giving me some fashion tips . Magnifico is the best dad ever . Ever ! This may sound harsh but when I think back to my real dad I realize : he sucked . Gee , why would that sound harsh ? I actually love going home now . My whole life has changed . Enjoy it while it lasts . Sooner or later , your real dad 's coming back . I think you 're jealous because my dad 's more photogenic than your dad . - MAGNIFICO : My son ! - Papa ! So what brings you love puppies here ? I want to meet the men and women who have the honor of educating my only son . He insisted on having a special parent-teacher conference with your instructors . Isn 't he wonderful ! Hello , Mrs. Wallace . Bonjour monsieur Wallace . I am Miss Bouvier , Gary 's french teacher . Miss Bouvier , you are not a woman . - You are a monument . - Al ! I tease only . Later , my son , huh ? Ciao , Papa . Your papa sure is one hairy chick magnet . Yeah , and I 'm going to grow up to be just like him . Bravissimo ! Papa ? Son , why the long face ? You did not think I built this bubbly love nest for you alone , did you ? - You 're cheating on Mom . - Of course I am . Am I not Al Wallace ? I belong to all women everywhere . See you tuesday , huh ? I look forward to giving you another french lesson . Bonsoir , Gary . - I can 't believe this . - Not to worry . You will be receiving a " B " in her class guaranted . Just a " B " ? Well , as you know if one lingers too long in a jacuzzi , well ... Can 't you guys give Magnifico just one more chance ? He 's got such a nice butt . I don 't care if he 's got buns of steel Magnifico 's out of here , end story . I can 't just change things back to the way they were . The wish ... we know- - I doesn 't end till it ends . Is there an owner 's manual you 're not showing us ? It 's not her fault , Gary . We made her . If we don 't have a clue , why should she ? I remember an episode of Star Trek where this guy 's past and future self came together . - Gary , it 's TV . - Not just any TV , Star Trek- - the most scientifically accurate portrayal of the future ever told . You 'll never get them together . Magnifico 's on a european tour promoting his swimsuit calender . - My mom 's a fan . - Maybe I can help . What 's the name of that coffeehouse you guys hang out at ? - The Java man ? - There 's the one . Your hearts 's desire ? Cappuccino ? Biscotti ? Goobers ? Whatever the son of Al Wallace wants the son of Al Wallace gets . Well , I have had my eye set on an autographed Magnifico Calend . There you go , my dear . Well , well ... a family of Magnifico fans . Yes . Big fans . I 'm Gary . This is Mom . Mom . A beautiful name for a beautiful woman . And this is Al Wallace ... my dad . - Gary , are you all right ? - This has to work . Come on , big winds . Whoo . lightning ... spooky magic sparks . Shape-shift . My son , the great pride I feel for you is quickly diminishing . Gary , you 're embarrassing your father . Mom , you don 't understand . This isn 't Dad . This is Dad . You don 't love him . You love this guy . Tell her ! Tell her ! You 're my real father ! - Gary 's losing it . - Big time . Go get him . I 'll distract Magnifico . Is the son of Al Wallace making a funny ? No . I 'm not making a funny . He 's my dad . Kid , look at me . Do you really think I could be your father ? I 'm a supermodel . Hi , Mr. and Mrs. Wallace . Gary , let 's go see how they grind coffee . Mom , you must know that deep down you belong with this guy . Such nonsense . Your mother and I were made for each other . We are as one ... bonded body and soul until the end of time . I must go put coin in meter now . This is a nightmare , Wyatt , and it 's all Lisa 's fault . Now we 'll never ... - Wait . Look . - Look what 's happening . High-strung kid you have there . Um , he needs a little discipline . His father pampers him . You can 't pamper kids . I find the best way to keep them in need is to make them fear you . You sound experienced . You have children of your own ? Not that I recall . So , would you like a calendar ? I 'd be happy to sign one for such a lovely woman . Oh , gosh . I don 't know . My husband ... Oh , you are so beautiful . Perhaps it 's not my place to say but you 're married to a heel . Oh , no . Uh ... it 's ... Okay . No , it 's not . I may not be the most romantic guy in the world but if I were lucky enough to be married to someone as beautiful as you I 'd always be faithful ... always . Oh ... that 's nice of you to say . Well , I mean it . You seem like you deserve better . That 's all . Is it you ? Please , tell me it 's you ! - Get off me , you idiot . - Papa ! - So , life with Dad back to normal ? - Yeah , pretty much . It sucks . But at least now I get to deal with my personal hell in the comfort of my own Jacuzzi . Well , this will cheer you up . Watch . Hey , Chett . That 's one ugly truck . That 's your opinion . And my opinion is that this truck has a weeny transmission a gutless engine and a lousy tonka-toy-tire-traction perfect for a hyper-wanker like you . That 's it . You 're dead , butt camp ! Ow ! You were saying , Mr ... bighead ? Hit ' em where it hurts , Wy . I 'm going to kick your putrid , belly-white free-range chicken ... Ow ! CHETT : What the hell is going on ? I don 't know how Lisa 's ever going to top this . That 's easy . Here . Better get him before he hits the jet stream . ( Pop ) ( Air Releases ) Captioned by Grantman Brown

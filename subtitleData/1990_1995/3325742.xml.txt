 How could she give us a popquiz on friday ? It doesn 't matter . It was a sucky week and it was destined to end with a sucky quiz . It 's the hayy twins- - joyful and smiley . Welcome home , boys . Can it . - We 're not in the mood . - Maybe I can cheer you up . Something to brighten your dark and gloomy lives . " Cd Rom Deathforce " Unbelievable ! Where did you get this ? This isn 't even out yet . I have connections . Go ahead . Pop it in . BOTH : Yes ! - Choose your man . - I am Lethar . I 'll the Infero ! Ready to battle Zanthrax , the Walking Death Machine ? - I 'm so glad you guys like it . - Let the Bloodbath begin . - I just want to make you happy . - COMPUTER : Welcome to level one . All right , we 're in ! " Lisa , surprising us with this gift was a nice thing to do . " " Thank you very , very much , Lisa . You 're the best friend we have . " Hey , Lis , how about playtime munchies ? Chips , dip , wings . I 'm not in the wing mood . How about some frozen candy bars ? I live to serve . Okay , here we go ! Whoo ! I got it ! I got it ! All right , here we go ! Left ! Left ! Left ! You 've been doing that for 12 hours . What do you say we do something else ? How about hawaii ? Climb a few volcanoes ? In a minute . He 's going for the damsel ! - ( Explosion ) - Suck on your own blood , buddy ! - COMPUTER : Welcome to level seven . - Whoo ! We have to pick up more power pods to get the antimatter blasters . - Where you going ? - To whiz . Pause the game . We 're three levels from staying Zanthrax and becoming masters of his world . You can 't go to the bathroom . Lis ? - No . - Please ? Go ahead . Have a party . ( Whistling ) Huh , dry as a bone . Now , that 's a handy little trick . You are very talented . Come on . Let 's play . I got him . Watch out ! Get it ! Use your blasters ! It 's not me ! Here we go ! Get him ! Get him ! - Yes ! - Yes ! COMPUTER : Game over . Congratulations . You are the victor . Zanthrax is dead . Have a nice day . - " Game over " ? That 's it ? - It stops at level ten ? - How lame . - Yo , Lis , we need more levels . I 'm sorry . Were you talking to me ? - We need you to extend the game . - Whoa . I thought you were actually saying something to me that wasn 't a whiny , selfish little command . Oh , well . Enough of my crazy little fantasy . What can your faithful , magic vending machine , Lisa zap up for you now ? A few more levels- - something more challenging . Yeah , but if you want to lay down for a while - we can take a break . - No ! You want a real challenge ? I 'll give you a real challenge . ( Thunderclap ) When do you think we should start to worry ? I already have . ( Bell Rings ) - Maybe she won 't do anything . - I 've never seen her that mad . Maybe she 'll make gym class last all day . Maybe this is our punishment- - Getting us all nervous over nothing . ( Gun Zapping , as in Video Game ) Gar ! Gar , are you all right ? I can 't move . What the hell was that ? ( Stomping ) - Prepare to die . - ( Screaming ) ( Screaming ) Oh , my God , it 's Zanthrax ! Lisa must have made the video game come of life . It wants to kill us . I figured that out . - What are we going to do ? - ( Growling ) - The fire alarm . - Gary , we can 't do that . We 'll end up in detention . - ( Growling ) - ( Alarm Ringing ) We got to get to Lisa . Hi , guys . I 'm making fluffernutters . You want some ? Do you know what 's going on ? Ooh , sorry . What 's the problem ? This level not challenging enough for you ? - Hey . - I think there 's something you should see . This is so like you . We act a little bit immature so you get all pissy and bring Zanthrax the Walking Machine to life . - You should take a look at this . - You wanted to play more levels in that stupid game so I made you more levels , - just like you told me to . - You 're getting back at us . You 've twisted our words around . All you did was whine and complain and you never thanked me . - Guys ! - BOTH : What ? Is this noticeable ? I hope you 're happy . You had to blow a gaping , charred hole out of the middle of my best friend but you taught us a lesson . Can you end this spell and put Gary back together ? I can 't end the spell . It 's out of my control now . - WYATT : But what about Gary ? - Yeah . I 'm dying here . I 'm sorry . I thought you guys were good at this game . Wy ... before I buy the farm there 's something I have to tell you . No . Just hang on . You 're going to be okay . - Lisa ! - There 's no time . Remember the girl in fifth grade you had a crush on , Kim Larson ? You asked her put and she said no and went out with me instead ? Forget about it , Gary . Whatever it is , it doesn 't matter right now . I 'm calling 911 . I told her you had head lice . So she 'd dump me and go out with you ? There 's some sort of tunnel ... and a light . - PHONE : 911 Emergency . - Answer the question . Please ... forgive me . Gary ? Gary ? Oh , man ! Don 't die on me . Of course I forgive you . You 're my best friend . I 'll never forget that . This can 't be happening . What do you know , I 'm back . We each get five lives just like the game . - Head lice ? - It was fifth grade . Besides , she dumped me so we 're even . - We are not . - You forgave me . You were dead . ( Loud Pounding ) Oh , no . It 's come for us . ( Growling ) ( Pounding ) We need a plan . We need five inch steel walls . He moves fast for a big guy . What are we going to do ? If this is just like the video game only real ... It 's definitely real . Then the only way we 'll get out this is by killing Zanthrax . He 's shooting flame balls . Where will we find firepower to match that ? What do you pucker-butts want ? It 's kind of hard to explain . There 's this ... Well , it 's a ... A uh ... What ? There 's a seven foot bloodthirsty monster trashing the house . We need you to kill it . - What 's this thing packing ? - A fireball launcher . Amateur . - It didn 't even phase him . - He 's an ex-marine . They live for this kind of thing . You tell Mom and Dad and this stash I 'll bury you alive in here . Looks like we 're going on a bug hunt . Chett , I 'm just curious . Why do you have all this stuff ? Just exercising my constitutional right to bear arms , wuss-boy . A man 's got to hunt . Semiautomatics for deer . Grenades for pond fishing and flamethrowers are good for anything that lives down a hole . It doesn 't seem very safe to have all this stuff . Oh , sure . You whine about gun control but as soon as there 's a seven foot tall inter-dimensional space monster in your bedroom then suddenly owning a gun makes sense . Let 's dance . ( Growling ) ( Growling ) All right , you butt-ugly space monkey . I don 't know where you 're from or why you 're here . All I know is ... you are pathetic , life-force . I would disembowel you , but you don 't have any guts . - ( Laughing ) - Oh , yeah ? You want a piece of this ? Rip me open ! I 'll show you who 's got guts ! Come back here . - That bought us 30 seconds . - We need something really powerful . We need those laser blasters from the game . - Like these ? - Gimme , gimme , gimme . What do you say ? Never again will we complain , whine or think less of any gift you give us out of the goodness of your heart . We are humbled by your magnificence . Close enough . This is going to be so awesome . We got monsters , ray guns and I got four lives left . You still have four lives ? - What 's your problem ? - That 's for Kim Larson . - Now we 're even . - I don 't think so . - You had it backwards , you idiot . - Shut up . No , you shut up . No , you shut up . Guys , stop . When your game 's over it 's really over . I suggest you increase the peace . I 'm sorry . I was mad , I had a ray gun ... Ditto . - We got some monster butt to fry . - It 's time to implement plan " A. " Search , locate , and annihilate . ( Grunting ) ( Growling ) The damsel is mine . The game is over . ( Laughing ) Okey-dokey . What 's plan " B ? " Lisa ? We got to go get her . - What ? - Where are we going to go get her ? In the computer . That thing took her with it . - We got to go in there after her . - You can 't go into a computer . There isn 't a little door that magically shrinks you . Oh . But a creature from a computer game can come to life and hurl fireballs at us . - Guys , it 's me , in here . - It can 't be . Zanthrax is holding me prisoner and I can 't use my powers . - You 've got to get me out . - How ? How do we get in there ? There 's a little door that magically shrinks you . It 's the passageway between the two worlds . - Where do we start ? - I can 't tell you . - All I know is I smell brownies . - The damsel is the bride of Zanthrax . If you attempt to resuce her I will rip the skin from you bones and fill the rivers of virtual space with your blood . ( Laughing ) I think they make a nice couple . Guys , help me . Get me out of here . We got to go find that passageway . That passageway 's got to be here somewhere . She said she smelled browines . I got it . Stand back . ( Screams ) - What is this ? - My dad made dinner last night . It 's got to be in here . - Do we have any weapons left ? - Nope . - Extra points ? - Uh-uh . - How many lives do we have left ? - None . After you . - Do you see anything yet ? - Greasy builddup . Stay out of the oven . Zanthrax set a trap . It 'll scramble your atoms . ( Screaming ) Talk to me . You okay ? That 's the last time I crawl into your oven . He 's coming after you guys . Forget about me and get out of the house . - Good advice . Prepare to die . - ( Screaming ) Wait . You call yourself a monster ? - These are unharmed children . - She 's got you there . You can 't just kill them . Where 's the challehat ? If you were a really scary monster you 'd make them suffer an incredibly painful humiliating death . I was with you until the incredibly painful death part . - What are you saying ? - Trust me . We shall have a competition . If you win , she will go free . - If you lose , you die . - Not much of second prize . Because I will be victorious I will allow you to choose the contest of battle . Make your choice now . Think carefully about this . It 's yours . We choose , huh ? All right , then . We choose to fight . By ... hot tubbing it in aspen with en vogue . first one to second base wins . ( Water Splashing and Women Laughing ) WOMAN : Ooh , this is great ! Who 's have thought ? His definition of second base is a little fuzzy if you ask me . Silence . You have been beaten and now you must die . Wait a minute . Double or nothing . One more contest . One more contest . This time , if you win I 'll give you the secrets to my power in the other world . - With it , you 'll be unstoppable . - You can 't do that . - He 'll be free to destroy our world . - It 's our only hope . I accept your wager . Choose your contest . - Okay . - Hold on . This time I choose . Where are we ? What is this ? It was the first thing that popped into my head . Ready ? Begin . GARY : We 're playing turbo pong for the future of the world ? - How can we lose ? - But turbo pong ? ( Beeps When Ball is Hit ) Ha . The points is mine . One to nothing . Nice move . You guys concentrate . - She 's right . We can do this . - I don 't know , Gary . He 's a lot better at this than I thought . Hey , if we play as a team , nothing can stop us . Besides , we 're only down by one . - Hey , what are we playing to ? ! - Two . He is a monster . ( Both Grunting ) Eat this , pirate pants ! Ah ! Yes ! There 's something wrong with the paddles . GARY : Nice try . One-up . - Our serve . - Okay , game point . Let 's slaughter this thing and get out of here . Not to put pressure on but if you miss this the world as we know it comes to an end . Why would that put any pressure on us ? All right , you walking scrap heap give it your best shot . WYATT : I hate turbo pong . I hate losing . ( Growling ) Yes ! You played fair and won . The damsel is yours . You will be returned . Oh , and , uh ... ( Chuckles ) Sorry about cheating back there . Guys , you did it . I 'm so proud . And who says video games don 't help you in the real world ? Yeah . Nice ace on the last point , guys . Sorry we got you so mad before . I guess we did get a little carried away with Deathforce . - Consider it deleted . - Good , because I really missed you guys . I know you didn 't really mean it but it felt like you were taking me for granted and it hurt . Lisa , we could never take you for granted . Up for a little tetris for old time 's sake ? Cool . Hey , Lis , how about you fetch us up a couple of root beer floats and some sandwiches , chop-chop . What ? Kidding . Joke . - I 'll get myself . - Chop-chop . ( Laughing ) Go help him .

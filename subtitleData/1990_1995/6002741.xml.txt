 I 'd be careful with that backhand , Clark . You 're gonna hurt yourself . Tell me about it . I thought you did really well for your first time . Hi , guys . Hey , Lana . Come on , you almost forgot . Oh yeah , I 'll , I 'll be right back , okay ? Okay ! I 'll tell you what . We 'll wait . Listen , I happen to have two tickets to the phantom and I was wondering if you 'd like to go ? Ahh , that would be really nice . But I 'm kinda busy and so- - oh , that 's okay , I just thought I 'd ask . Here 's that book you wanted to borrow . Great ! Hey , thanks . Bye-bye . Bye . Johnny Avonasac ask you out again ? Yeah , for about the tenth time . I don 't know what it is . He 's , he 's a nice guy , but nice and dull . And , he doesn 't do anything for me . It 's like he 's too perfect . I wouldn 't worry about it , babe . He doesn 't do anything for me either . Don 't turn the light on . Stanley ? What the ? Are you surprised to see your bad half ? What happened ? Who did this to you ? I never kept very good company . You know that . This time it got me shot . But I did manage to get away with this . And they wanted it bad . Real bad . Let me get you to a doctor Stanley . No , damn it ! It 's too late for that . I 'm dying . You 're my brother , Johnny . I guess I felt I had to come back here . Just to see you once more . Now you take this . And you drink it . It 'll do things for you that you can 't believe . What are you talking about Stanley ? Just drink it . Then don 't say that- - I never did anything for you . Just drink it . Stanley , hang in there . Don 't let go . Stanley ! Don 't let go ! No ! I can 't believe it . He was just in class yesterday . Yeah , and it was Johnny 's brother . It 's a tough break . Maybe I should go over to his place and give him my condolences . Gee , that sounds like a good idea , Lana . You want us to come with you ? No , I think it would be better if I just go alone . Guess I can 't deny a brother 's last request . Look at me ! What have I become ? I 've turned into a living , walking , disease . Ha ! I burped ! Well , how do you like that ? Is , is Johnny Avonasac home ? I 'm a friend of his . Yeah , right ! Actually , Johnny 's not home right now . He , ahh , felt a little time away would , ah , be good for him . Oh , I , I understand . Uhm- - This might be a really stupid question but , what are you doing right now ? Well , I , actually , I , I 'm Johnny 's cousin and , I just dropped by to take care of a few loose ends . Would you take me out ? Me ? You wanna go out with me ? Yes , I 'd love to ! Oh , well , I ahh , actually- - I 'm kinda on my way over to my br , ahh- - I mean Johnny 's brother 's place to find a few things out . You know , look for some clues . Clues ? Are you a detective ? Actually , yeah . I 'm trying to find out who killed my cousin . I would really love to go with you . Yeah ? Good ! I didn 't catch your name . Johnny Avon- - Casanova . Yeah , that 's it . Johnny Casanova . It fits . Some place this Stanley had . You know Johnny never mentioned he had a cousin so attractive . Me ? Attractive ? I can 't believe you 're so surprised ! I have never met anyone quite as charming as you . Oh yeah ? Yeah , I ahh , guess I know what you mean . Stanley had an awful lot of appointments at this club , the Last Tango . I know where it is . I 'd love to go there with you . I don 't know baby . It could get pretty sticky . I got a friend . He knows Superboy really well . He could help . He knows Superboy ? Yeah . Why don 't you meet me at the dorms ? Here 's the room number . Are you okay ? Yeah . I think I just need a little fresh air . Whoa , why don 't you look through this ? Look , you gotta lock up for me . I gotta go now . But what- - ? What luck ! A cab ! Yeah where you going , buddy ? I gotta get home . There ain 't but one place you 're going . I think I 've fallen in love . Who is this guy ? To put it simply , he 's the man of my dreams . So when do we get to meet this prince charming ? Oh , he 's coming over tonight . Tonight ? I 'm so excited ! Aren 't you ? So then , when I was in third grade , I told my teacher , hey , I want to be a hit man for the mob when I grow up . Of course my parents were called in right away and were told I needed to see a shrink . Oh , I love that story . Hey , Frank , watch this ! Ahh , ahh ! Look at me ! I 'm the donut monster ! Hey , it was really great talking with ya . I 'm sorry about that little gun play awhile ago . You know , before you took that potion . No problem ! Look , I just hope this Mr. Gore Guy doesn 't ahh beat you too bad for botching the job . Ahh , I will just tell him you bonked me on the head and escaped . That 's a good one . Thanks for the ride . No problem , buddy ! Hey , I almost forgot . Here 's your change for the movies . Hey , it looks like you 're a buck short . But keep the change ! It 's him ! Do I look okay ? Just great ! Okay . Lana ! Ooh you look so- - You don 't like it . Well , it could be a little bit better . But , can 't have everything , huh ? Clark , Andy , I want you to meet Johnny Casanova . Hi , guys . Is this the whole place ? Yes . How do you stand it ? This dump . It 's so , ahh , clean . We kinda like it . Well , I guess , if you never had better . Hey ! Cheers ! Hey ! Help yourself , man ! Ahh ! I hate this poster ! I bought that ! You don 't mind throwing this away for me do ya ? Thanks ! Boy , if I had something that ugly- - no , I love your shoes ! They 're just phenomenal ! They 're outrageous ! Where 'd you get ' em ? Why don 't you take a picture ? It 'll last longer ! Listen , Clark , do you think you could get a hold of Superboy ? Casanova thinks there might be a connection with the Last Tango Nightclub and then Stanley Avonasac 's death . Yeah , we 're gonna go down there tonight and see what we can dig up . Yeah , I can get a message to Superboy . But do you think it 's really a good idea ? Oh , I feel very safe with Casanova . You will , ahh , do this for us , huh ? Sure . Okay . Great . Great ! By the way , what 's that on your shirt ? I love that one ! Hey , Johnny ! You want to play tennis some time ? You and me ? Play a little tennis ? Hey , I don 't think so ! I hate tennis ! Me too ! Great guy ! You really think so ? Yeah ! Well , honestly , at first I thought he was kind of a jerk . But , after a couple of minutes , boy he sure grew on me ! I really don 't think so . In fact , I don 't understand what Lana sees in him . Oh , Clark , I think you 're just a little bit jealous . Come on . He 's got charm , grace , pizzazz . He 's a great guy ! I see what Lana likes about him . I think we should follow them . Hey , part the crowd . Hey , would you pal ? Thank you lady . Hey , hey , buddy ! There 's a line here . But you can go right ahead ! Thanks , pal ! Whoa , hey ! Whoa , wait a second ! Wait a second ! What ? Ah , excuse me sir ! If you 'll just follow me , I 'll show you a special table reserved for our finest customers , ha ha ! Perfect ! Sir , we would like to present you with this bottle of champagne and this caviar . Compliments of the house . Why , thank you very much ! Good year ! Ahh , stuff tastes like fish heads ! Yuck ! Come on , baby ! Let 's dance ! Hey people , look out ! Look out ! Big daddy 's coming through ! Clear this dance floor ! It 's gotta be him ! Look at the way everyone 's acting ! Man , he 's gotta be using the potion . Hey , you know what the boss said . You gotta keep your distance . Otherwise , it 'll affect you . I don 't have to tell you what Mr. Gore did to that guy driving the cab this afternoon . No . Look , I 'll get someone to bring him a message . You stay in the van . I 'll be in the alley . Sir , this is for you . This could be it . Someone wants us to meet them outside . Could be dangerous . Well , I 'm with you all the way . I don 't see him anywhere . There 's some really lovely women here tonight . Stop it ! Stop it ! Step on it man ! Let 's get them into the Gore 's van ! Hurry up ! Clark ! Look what I found . Andy , I really gotta go ! No , no this other one 's a maniac for you , man ! But , but Andy , I- - And you- - Hey , boss ! The girl 's in the basement . This is Casanova . Remove the sack . And let me see what he looks like . Well , well ! A man of charm . What a nice visit Mr. Casanova . Eww , well I wish I could say the same but I can 't . Hey ? What 's it like to be fat and ugly ? Huh , Mr. Gore ? Hey ! You are the charmer . Yeah , and you 're the murderer . You killed my brother Stanley , didn 't you ? Come on ! I believe he had something . Something I have been searching for . For a long , long time . Well , looks like you 're gonna have to wait a little longer . I think not ! I want you to take him out and- - Buy him a new car ! Ahh- - No ! Take him and pull out his fingernails ! Then , search him for the potion ! Ahh , you guys don 't want to do that , now do ya ? Actually , he seems like a really nice guy , boss . Do we really have to search him ? I said , I want him tortured and searched ! Ahh , boss , I don 't know if I can do that . See , ahh , I 'd like to play cards with him and ahh , smoke cigars ? I thought this might happen ! It seems your charms are far reaching , Casanova . I guess I 'll just have to wait until the effects wear off . And then , my men can torture you with glee . Now , what do you need the potion for ? You 're already a bundle of joy . That potion will enable me to rule the world ! Look what it 's done for you . Throw him in the basement . The potion 's effect should wear off soon . Let 's go this way man . I don 't care what we have to go through , Casanova . I 'm just glad I can be near you . It 's like every minute I 'm with you , I grow to want you more and more . I gotta get out of here ! We die , at least we die together . Are you okay ? Yeah , fine . I 'll be okay . I want you to check the basement every 10 minutes . He 's got to change back soon . You got it boss ! Where are Lana and Casanova ? This could be the way out . Just be careful . Don 't worry about me , baby . Superboy ! He went in there . Johnny , what are you doing here ? Where 's Casanova ? Mr. Gore 's men grabbed me- - and locked me in there . Well , where 's Casanova ? He , he passed me running down the sewer . He , he 's long gone . Did he say anything ? Will I ever see him again ? I don 't know . Sometimes he just disappears and then shows up again . Here , let me help you . Johnny , I think Casanova dropped this . If I see him , I 'll give it to him . You do that . If you see him . Captioned by Grant Brown

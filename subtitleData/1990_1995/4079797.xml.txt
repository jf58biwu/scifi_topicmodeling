 Damn . There 's ash in the wine from the fires in Malibu Canyon . You can almost see from here . I want you to know I ... I don 't do this . I mean , I 'm not one of those guys ... that sends his family on vacation just so he can ... - But when I met you at the corporate party , I ... - Shh . It 'll be worth it . I 'll do things with you no one 's ever done . X-Files Season 2 Episode 07 - 3 - Let 's start in the bedroom and work our way downstairs . - Okay . - Don 't let the media in on the writings in blood on the wall . - Okay . Excuse me , sir , if I can ask your indulgence , this is a restricted crime scene . Agent Mulder . I 'm with the Bureau . - Nobody called the Bureau . - They should have . Look , L.A.P.D. has seen ... I don 't know , what ... maybe a couple of weird crime scenes down the years . - I think we can handle things . - There 's no time for rivalries . I don 't care about credit for the arrest or what goes on whose record . In the past year , these killers have murdered six people . They only kill at night . By the end of the week , two more people will be dead , and they will be gone . - Just how do you know all this ? - There 's a file on the murders . I 've studied it . I 've been waiting three months for them to reappear . Just how can you be sure that these are the same killers ? The wire reported a body was found drained of blood , bite marks on the exterior jugular and median cubital veins . Every mirror in the house was smashed . Yeah , well , it 's what the wire didn 't report that distinguishes this scene . There 's writings on the wall ... written in the victim 's blood . " He who eats of my flesh and drinks of my blood shall have eternal life ... and I will raise them up on the last day " . They have the same feeble literal grasp of the Bible ... as all those big-haired preachers do . The victim , was he a father ? Yeah , three boys . The family 's been notified . In Memphis they murdered James Ellis , 58 , the father of Ellis and Sons Clothiers . The second victim was a Korean woman , Linda Sun . The third victim was a Jesuit theologian . Excuse me . In Portland , three months ago , the first victim was a priest . The second victim was the only son in a family of six children . The last victim was the owner of a New Age bookshop , the Holy Spirit . I believe that 's how they perceive themselves as a kind of unholy trinity . They use these to extract the blood , and then store it for a quick fix later . Their need is insatiable , but murdering for blood risks exposure and capture . If my profile of the previous cases holds true , they 've been living in the city and working near blood products for the past month . Look , Agent Mulder ... Look , I 'm really sorry I was such a hard-ass back there , but in this town , it 's really tough to trust anyone . Truth is , I 'd be happy to have You work on our investigation . - Now , this is Detective Gwynn ... - I 'm working alone . An FBI agent without a partner ? Look , Mulder , our department 's under a crisis alert now ... because of the fires in the canyon . The fact is , I don 't think I can free up any resources for you right now . I only need one thing . - Hollywood Blood Bank . Yeah , hi . This is Marty Mulder from your payroll service . I have a question regarding the W-4 form of a recent employee . - You mean Frank ? - When was he hired ? A couple weeks ago . He 's the night watchman . - Hey ! Easy , man . Easy . - Federal agent ! Sorry , man . I didn 't know you was there . Damn freak night watchman down there always breaking ' the lightbulbs . I 'll wait up stairs . Federal agent ! Freeze ! Turn off the lights ! Turn ' em off ! You 're killing me . Turn ' em off ! Turn ' em off . - Tell us your real name . - I can 't take it . Turn off the lights ! You 're killing me . Turn them off ! Please ! Turn off the lights ! Please . Turn them off ! That better ? I 'll only talk to him . Lucky you . You know what we are . What are you ? He is the father , I am the son and she is the unholy spirit . And the three of you killed Garrett Lorre . No . Your fingerprints were found at the crime scene . - No ! When a snake eats a fly , it 's not murder . It just is . Frogs eat flies . - Are you dead ? - I never will be . - Do you believe that ? Don 't you wanna live forever ? Not if draw string pants come back into style . Look , what nobody realizes is that ... there is no after life ! I know this ... Listen to me . Listen to me . I know this because when we prolong our lives by taking theirs , all I see is such ... horror ... . in their eyes . That 's because at that moment , they 're face to face with death . And suddenly they realize there 's nothing else . There 's no heaven . There 's no soul . There 's just rot , and there 's just decay . And I will never , ever , ever , ever have to face that . It 's a stiff price , though . Look at yourself , drinking blood , living in darkness , unable to see your reflection . Or is that just a myth ? I can 't be seen in a mirror . Look ... anything worth anything has a price . When I 'm standing next to your deathbed ... looking as young as I look right now , and I see that fear in your eyes ... at the moment of death , then ... then tell me the price is too stiff . It 's more likely I 'll be looking into your eyes ... at the moment before they lead you into the gas chamber . But that 's a moment you won 't have to face if you tell me where the others are . Why would I ? They 're the only ones that can kill me . Well , if you are what you say you are , I know what can kill you . It would be very easy to cover those windows . Just tell me where the other two are . In a couple of hours , there will be no escaping the sun , son . If he wants to talk , cover the windows and call me . What if he turns into a bat and flies out through the bars ? That man is clearly delusional , but I get the sense that not even he believes his own claims . For now , we 've gotta play along with his beliefs . I 'm hoping that the sunlight will give him an excuse to talk . Why don 't you go back to your hotel and get some sleep ? I didn 't check into a hotel room . I don 't sleep anymore . Number four right away ! Number four right away ! An edemaballat thenostrils , rupture of the skull due to internal steam pressure ... These are indications of long exposure to extreme temperatures , not sunburn for 15 seconds . The guards found no flammable materials ? I had believed that ... this man 's illness was psychological . There is a condition known as Gunther 's Disease . congenital erythropoietic porphyria creating cutaneous photo sensitivity . I 'm familiar with porphyria . It 's an affliction that causes lesions and blisters ... when skin is exposed to sunlight , not fourth-degree burns . Sufferers may have ahema deficiency ... which can be supplemented by a small ingestion of blood , not the kind of blood thirst that this man had . It 's probably ignorance of porphyria as a disease ... that led to the creation of vampire myths in Asia in the Middle Ages . I had dismissed the possibility ... of the actual existence of such a creature as myth . You are really upsetting me ... on several levels . - When will you get the blood tests back ? - Next week . What 's this purple stain here ? Could be an ink stamp , like they give at a party or a club . Can you read it ? It is possible that the heat burned the ink permanently ... into the lower levels of the skin . An old coroner 's trick . I can make a quarter appear from behind your ear . Are you about to ask what a normal person like me is doing in a place like this ? How do you define normal ? Misha , red wine . I don 't . How do you ? All I know is normal is not what I feel . You 've lost someone . Not a lover , a friend . I 'll get these . " He who drinks my blood ... " - " Has eternal life " . - You 're not interested in this place , in what we do . - How do you know ? You 're afraid of me . I take the life of others ... inside me ... into my blood . I need to know . All day long I deal with equity , notes , bonds , nothing that 's real . And this gives my life ... life . My name 's Kristen . It 's a normal name . AIDS . Aren 't you afraid ? I wish I could die . The father . The sun . I don 't know who you are , freak , but we 're two consenting adults . Now , get the hell outta here . Kristen ? Kristen ! Kristen . Come out . Hmm . It 's my turn . Don 't worry . I took care of that guy . I told you I 'd protect you . The murderers cut off the power supply at some point , and the phone . Fits their M.O. Agent Mulder , this is our forensic dentist you requested , Dr.Jacobs. How do you do ? I don 't want to bias your report , but I need a preliminary examination ... for anything unnatural . Uh-huh . Shine the light down here . Agent Mulder . All this time I 've been putting raspberry sauce on ice cream . Check these prints immediately . One will be the victim 's , the other should be the woman we 're looking for . Right . Well , the bites are not done by an animal . These are human . And realize this is a cursory exam , but I 'd say they were made by three different people . The unholy spirit . - We 've got the front . You go around the back . - Uh-huh . You , check the garage . Okay , do it . Open her up . Miss Kilar ? Los Angeles Police Department . We have a warrant to search the premises . I found these , veterinary needles . The size matches the puncture wounds on the previous victims . And look at this . This is from a snakebite kit . It 's placed over the wound to extract poison . - Only this one ... - Has blood in it . Detective ? Over here . Well , she wasn 't at work , and she 's not here . She 's gone , and she 's not coming back . Special Agent Fox Mulder , Federal Bureau of Investigation . They 're after you . How do you know ? The bread , legends in Eastern European countries . It said that one can protect one 's self by eating bread filled with blood . You were protecting yourself . And now you 're protecting me ? I think it 's best if I took you into protective custody . They 'll kill once more . They 'll try to kill you , Hmm . Why are you here alone ? Because you think you 're not afraid ? Because you need to know ? You need to know they are who they believe they are . What I believe you to be . One change in the wind , and the fires will move this way . Have you ever tasted blood ? No , you haven 't . Blood tastes ... dangerous . It 's sweet ... and thick . You were in Memphis and Portland when the other murders occurred . How are you connected ? When I was a little girl , my father beat me . Abuse is too frail a word . He showed his love for me by beating me . I was dead . One night he hit me so hard , he knocked out two teeth and locked me in my room . The blood poured from my mouth onto the floor ... and down my throat . It was the only way I knew I was alive . I met John in Chicago . You know him as the " son " . He also beat me . I guess that 's the way it works sometimes . He hit me once and cut open my lip . I was angry , and as revenge , I jumped on him and I bit through his lip . He tasted my blood , and I tasted his . After that , we were into blood sports . But ... I never ... I lost him . One night he came home with two others ... and it turned ... unnatural . I left him , and I moved to Memphis . But they followed you . They want you . I 'm tired of running . And you 're here to protect me . Are you trying to ward me off ? It 's from someone I lost . Well , I hope you find her . The one you lost , John , he 's ... dead . But they 've picked up another . They 're three again . Kristen , I think you 'll be safer if you come back to the police station with me . Without him , they won 't come for me . I won 't go . Then I won 't go . You need to get cleaned up . - Yeah ? No mirrors . I don 't like the way I look . It makes this hard . I 'll do it . Hmm . It 's not who you are . It doesn 't make you happy . I 've been watching . I had to wait ... for you to finish . I had to wait to tell you ... it 's true . I was as surprised as anybody . You can live forever . Everybody else just dies , but we ... we come back . The spirit showed me . And now she 'll show you . We live in a different world , Kristen . And nobody on the outside can end my life . You can 't kill me , but I can kill you . I know , Kristen , what I did to you . It was ... If I were to die , I would certainly go to hell ... for what I did . But I love you , and I can at one for eternity . Kill him ... and we 'll be together . You 've got to drink the blood of his spirit . - But he 's no ... - He is . A spirit is one who believes . He knows we 're possible . You don 't have much time before the sun comes up . Cut him open , and we 'll finish . - You have to go . - They here ? - The fire . - You have to go . - My car 's down the hill . Mine 's in the garage . The keys are in it . You have to get your things . I 'll be right there . He 's not dead . John 's alive . I saw him . Come on . - You all right ? - I won 't leave without him . I 'll go . We will rise up ! You can 't kill us ! You 're not one of us ! But I will be . I 'm tasting the blood of a believer . But you haven 't taken a life . I 'll take mine . Don 't do that . Don 't do that ! Don 't , don 't , don 't ! No , no , no ! Agent Mulder . I 'm sorry . We found four bodies , all dead . - The remains ? - The fire was extremely hot . It 's just ashes and bones .

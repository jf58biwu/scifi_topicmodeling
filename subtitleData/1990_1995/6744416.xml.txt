Dr. Tiptree started out in the ' 70s working on genetic alternatives to pesticides . For her PhD , she bred this ugly fellow right out of existence , eliminating an entire subspecies from the face of the earth . She instantly became a hero to some and public enemy number one to others . At one time or another , Dr. Tiptree was associated with each of your institutions . She disappeared from academia , government , and the private sector some years ago . Grapevine has it she 's back in the game and playing on one of your teams . Now , she can 't be on a federal grant , or I 'd know about it . I mean to know who 's got her . Don 't stonewall me , boys . I heard she 's been working over at Eunice corporation . It 's ... it 's true . She 's been with us for more than a year . But she insisted on working quietly . [ Whispering ] How come we haven 't seen any Eunice patents , grant applications with her name on it ? Uh , her contract gives her three years of sequestered R and D. We cannot legally interfere in her research for another 18 months without forfeiting our patents . Well , thank you . [ Laughs ] Please , no more surprises . [ Chickens clucking , camera whirring ] [ Whispering ] [ Chickens squawking ] Any obviously oversized eggs ? Any extraneous organic matter ? What the hell is extraneous organic matter ? That 's my wife you 're talking about , strangely orgasmic matter . [ Sneezes ] Ah , Jesus Christ . It 's all over me . Sorry . I think I 'm allergic to chickens . Forget it . Just a cold that 's going around . Everybody 's getting it . [ Chickens clucking ] [ Creaking ] [ Sighs ] [ Crunching ] Screen enlarge , right quadrant . Again , again , again ... Hold . Sorry for interrupting , Dr. Tiptree . [ Sighing ] It 's all right , Susan . Did they find it ? I 'm afraid not yet . [ Sighing ] [ Chickens clucking ] How about giving us a hand with this load ? Driver not a loader . [ Chickens clucking ] You ever seen such nervous chickens ? What do you think ? Maybe they smell rain . Or else the sky is falling . [ Chuckling ] All right now , ladies , buckle up . We 've got a long road ahead . [ Chickens clucking ] [ Loud nose-blowing ] Forget the excuses . Seal the barn . No trucks in or out . I want it found before the morning shift comes in . Send Swanson to the infirmary , and tell him to keep his goddamn mouth shut . And that goes for you and the others too , or I 'll personally guarantee you 'll be back plucking chickens in Arkansas . [ Sneezing ] Hey , Merle , how are you ? Hey , Tony . Sorry to say , no one in or out . Aw , I 've gotta get these cluckers over to fort Rogers , and I 'm three hours late . All right . We 'll say you left already .

It could completely wipe his brain . Please proceed , Dr. Martin . You have our undivided attention . [ Electric zapping ] I love this movie .

Yep , I got you . Doc , you been drinking ? No . I mean , yes . But look , what does that got to do with it ? This is no pink elephant . I 'm telling you , this is a girl ... a woman . Oh , it 's a woman , excuse me . In black lycra . Hurry up and get her . Listen , I 'm sorry doc , but I 've got my hands full here , okay ? I tell you what you do . You ... you keep her there , and I 'll send a car over there as soon as I clean up here . [ Sighing ] What do we got here ? Ugh , goddamn . This guy 's caught some serious flack . Maybe a bobcat ? Bobcat ? Yeah , bobcat . Hasn 't been a bobcat in these parts since I was a kid . I think they 're extinct . Well , maybe they 're making a comeback . [ Glass clinking ] Hey ! [ Sighs ] How can you do it ? What ? How can you rape your mother ? Excuse me ? You 're tearing her apart . Oh , gimme a break . Look , we 're just blasting a little bedrock and laying a little blacktop so people can get from here to there , that 's all . And what for ? There 's nothing out here . Build it and they will come . Oh , right , I get it . You 're one of those too-clever-to-give-a-shit guys . I know your kind . Well , you can go ahead and laugh through the apocalypse . First a road , then a gas station , motel or two ... What , a couple of fast food franchises ... Civilization ? [ Scoffs ] Drunk . [ Mysterious music ] * Fish and game department . We 've gone fishin ' , so leave a message . [ Beeps ] Morning , gene ... Or it will be when you hear this . This is Dr. raven from downstate . I 'm sending you a wound sample in the mail . Happy Birthday . Actually , I was hoping you could I.D. It for me . My eyes must be going . Have fun , let me know , and thanks . Bye . This is exactly what we have been trying to avoid . It 's not entirely our fault . You never said they could hatch that quickly . None of the others did . Perhaps it 's an aberration of some kind . But what is it ? I can 't say . But what do I tell the men that are searching for it ? They 'll know it when they see it . [ Camera beeps off ] [ Chuckling ] Oh , man . What 's the matter ? She hit you upside the head ? No , I just , uh , I fell asleep . Fell asleep ? Yeah . Oh , my head . Probably had yourself a nice little dream too , didn 't you ? Major corporations are killing our earth . [ Metal clanging ] You 're allowed to have an attorney present . Actually , several of our members are attorneys , myself included . So is she here ? No . She 's not here . She 's not ? She 's not here . [ Sighs ] Is this everybody ? Yes . Doc , I don 't want to hear no more about this until you 're ready to press charges . I 'm gonna deal with this my own way . Why don 't you go home and sleep it off . I could give a chicken 's lips for your excuses . Just find it ... Tonight . I told you , you 'll recognize it when you see it . [ Sighs ] [ Rock music ] * sometimes I wish I was woo woo ! * sometimes I wish I was [ laughing , whooping , music playing ] [ Light music ] * Pull up a rock . It 's happy hour . [ Chuckles ] I wanted to thank you for what you did ... Or didn 't do . Oh , you know , you can call me doc . Everyone else does . Why is that ? Something else I didn 't do . I wanted to give you this . What is it ? It represents the earth and friendship . Looks like a knot . It is a knot . I don 't even really know your name . Thrush . Thrush ? What kind of name is that ? Well , it used to be Ann , but it 's thrush now . Oh , okay , thrush . [ Chuckling ] Right . This used to be the dinosaur highway . This was a migration route 60 million years ago . It 's good to see this . It 's good to remember how small we are . I thought that 's what mirrors are for . Can 't you just try and picture it ? I mean , look at these mountains . You 're ripping ' em apart , and for what ? I mean , you 're taking something , and you 're making nothing . Hey , wait a minute , I 'm not taking nothing and doing anything with it . I 'm just the night man . I just maintain the machines and try to protect them from people like you . That 's all . I take no responsibility for any of this ... yeah , right , you 're just following orders ! That 's right . Whoo-hoo ! [ Rock music playing ] Can I get behind the wheel ? Oh , you want to take it ? Take it now ? [ Screaming ] Whoa ! Oh , my God ! I got it ! Whoo-hoo ! Hey , go on in there . I got it ! Watch out ... shit . Right here ! Shit . I 'd like to see the slo-mo on that one . Hey man , I 'm gonna go take a piss . I 'll be right back . - Be careful . - All right . Fuck . Shit . Finally ! [ Laughter , kissing ] You animal . [ Ominous music ] * [ belching ] [ Shouts ] [ Splatting ] [ Screaming , slurping chomps ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Help me ! [ Dinosaur roars ] Well , secretary , the way I see it , the F.D.A. Doesn 't need to test the meat at all . There 's nothing new in either a turnip or a cow , and either can be marketed and sold without being tested . So why should a few cows with a little tiny piece of DNA material from a turnip be any different . Uh-huh . Right . Mm ... well ... mm hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Have them fax their questions to me . Thank you . Well ? I think you should see this . The body of this man was found by his poultry truck . He was apparently attacked by some kind of animal . The local doctor sent some tissue , saliva , and blood samples to the state to check for any animal diseases ... Rabies , in particular . The tests were all clean . So what 's your point ? But something else showed up in the test . This is a genetic marker for a neutral sequence . The marker showed up in the saliva of the animal . This particular marker is registered to Eunice . It 's supposed to be in chickens . Now , couldn 't the animal have absorbed the marker by eating the chickens ? Well , either that , or the animal that attacked him was a chicken . Right . Attack of the killer poultry . Have some chicken . It 's good for you . The only chick I want is the one that did this to my face . [ Small roar ] [ Ominous music tones ] * [ gasps ] Let me drive you back . No , thanks . I 'd rather walk . Look , I 'm going that way anyway . If you don 't come , I swear to God , I 'm gonna drive around aimlessly for hours . You 'll be wasting oil and be polluting the atmosphere , killing small animals along the road , ripping up flora . Blackmail ? I 'm not proud . I know . No , thanks . [ Engine turns over ] [ Gurgling cough ] [ Coughs ] What is that ? Stay in the car for a second . [ Moaning ] What are you waiting for ? He needs help ! Now ! [ Sputtering coughs ] Stay here . Me esta comiendo , me esta comiendo . What 's he saying ? I can 't tell . I think he 's speaking Spanish . Me esta comiendo , me esta comiendo ! He says it 's eating him . What ? I guess he means the pain . Take it easy , man . Take it easy . You ever have someone die on you ? I mean , on you ? On your fucking lap ? No . [ Laughs ] You ever want to feel real small sometime , try it . So ... I guess when I saw that kid lying out there , you know ... It 's kind of ... I understand . You know , life does that to you . You run away , and it comes right back at you . I 'm sorry . I just couldn 't save him . Get the dart gun ready , 'cause if we see it , you 're gonna have to shoot it . I 'm gonna shoot it , but I 'm not gonna use a dart gun . What are you ... You heard the orders : Dart gun . Yeah , well fuck the orders . Shit ! There it is !

Mmm . [ Laughing ] Now , what if I were to tell you that this blueberry pie could sit in a box on a shelf , not in the refrigerator , mind you , but on a shelf , for up to 18 months without losing one blueberry 's worth of flavor or freshness , huh ? Mmm , go ahead . It 's all done with a little scientific magic . You see , each little blueberry is coated with a thin layer of goat embryonic fluid . [ Gagging , spitting ] Get the senator some water ! How about some milk ? Would you like some milk ? Give me some soy stuff . Here , just put that on ... sir , I 've got the results on the chicken question . Just one second . I 'll be right back , senator . Keep eating ! There is no way the animal could have absorbed the marker by eating a chicken . I almost got the senator to back down on these new regulations . The last thing we need is a biotech panic about chickens . Listen , nobody , but nobody hears about this until after the senator 's committee makes its recommendations , all right ? You know ... look . Better yet , until after the house clears it . And then we 're gonna clear up this mess ! Mess ? What mess ? Oh , uh , uh , nothing , senator . I was just telling Kroghe here to , uh , clean up this pie . Now , listen , why don 't you and I go down to the bar and let the executive branch buy you a drink ? I have to see her now . I 'm afraid that 's out of the question . If I don 't see her right this minute , there 's gonna be trouble . I 'm going over her head . I talk to her now , or I pull the plug out of the whole thing , just like that ! Dr. Tiptree will see you now . [ Coughing ] Jess ? I 'm so terribly , terribly sorry . Where are you ? It 's all right . Be angry . Allow yourself to feel the anger . It 'll be better . [ Sobbing ] She was my only child . I know . She was a lovely child . [ Sobbing ] They wouldn 't even let me see her . That 's because they didn 't want to upset you . We wanted to be sure first . To be sure ? I wanted to help you . That 's why I had her brought here . She 's going to be all right . Here ? She 's alive , and she 's here ? Yes , my friend . Can I see her ? Of course you can . [ Beeping ] [ Dramatic music ] * [ coughing ] Jane !

That 's too small of a party for me . But you care about the earth . I care about you . Everybody 's happy , huh ? It doesn 't work that way , not for me . How does it work ? Does it really work at all ? And what 's that supposed to mean ? What are you running away from , huh ? You 're just another one of these poor little rich girls playing at revolution . I 'm not running away from anything . You don 't know anything about me ! I 'm not the person I was . I 've changed . Yeah . People don 't change . They just unfold . [ Door slams ] Oh , what the hell is going on ? Goddamn it . You know , I love you people . Really , you earth 's first planet people ... All right , get the hell down , right now ! What are you gonna do , Tarzan ? Kill us ? We 're not moving , you understand ? You go call the cops , call the news . You honestly think anyone cares about this godforsaken shit hole ? We care . [ Gun cocks ] All right , fuck it . You know , if you 're here tomorrow morning when I get back , I 'm gonna cut you out with blow torches . Oh , and can I get anyone a tofu burger , a vegetarian sprout , wheatgrass sandwich ? Maybe some herbal tea ? No ? All right , hey , thanks for a lovely evening , really . It was grand . Oh , uh , by the way , you know , be on the lookout for bobcats . You know , they 're a ... they 're an endangered species , but the few that are left are usually pretty hungry . So knock yourself out . Hey , this is getting cold . I need my gravy ! Hold your giblets , slim . Hey , Downey ! Hey , doc ! [ Coughing ] [ Bell rings ] Side gravy . Hey , how 's your cholesterol ? Oh , it 's good . [ Coughing ] - Hey , doc ! - Hm ? I heard that kid you found was all carved up like a Christmas Turkey . Christmas Turkey 's right . I heard it was some sort of psycho cannibal job . Mm , you 've been watching too many of them Italian zombie flicks . Must have been some kind of animal , huh doc ? You know , a bobcat ate a fellow when I was a little kid . It wasn 't a local , though . It was a hobo . Friar , that is two ton load of chicken shit . Hey , doc , you ever heard of a bobcat ate anybody 's eyes ? No , predators don 't usually go for eyeballs . Eyes are more appealing to birds , like seagulls or crows or vultures . Hey , gimme a ... gimme a chicken salad , would you ? It 's coming right up . So you see , this was no bobcat , friar . I mean , it sucked his eyes right out of his head . Excuse me , would you all mind not talking so loud ? You 're upsetting my wife . She 's pregnant , you know . Oh , sure , gotta be careful . I heard of a woman by fisher , up at county line , she was pregnant , eight months pregnant . It was hunting season . And her husband just couldn 't stop talking about the big buck he bagged . Yeah , he kept going over and over and over it , all the gory details . What happened ? She had a baby boy , a beautiful baby boy , cute as a button , healthy as all get out , except had these two little bony growths coming out of his head , kind of like deformed antlers .

[ Screaming ] [ Chomping ] [ Screaming ] [ Growling , chomping ] [ Screaming ] Downey , um , could you maybe , uh , throw a little salad in a bag for me ? Since when did you start eating rabbit food ? Maybe he 's not . Maybe he 's keeping a rabbit . [ Roaring ] [ Gunshot ] [ Roaring ] Ugh , goddamn it ! [ Coughing ] Don 't you understand , the thing that killed them is the same thing that killed the others ? All right . Okay , doc . Look . Till I get this thing settled , I 'm gonna have to take you in . I 'm sorry . Can I take a leak ? Yeah , you can take a leak . - You want to guard me ? - No , I don 't want to guard you . Go ahead . Doc ? It 's nothing personal . [ Sighs ] Now , these people weren 't killed by a shotgun . It 's the exact same in all these cases , same as the truck driver , same as the kids . In each successive killing , the victim was pinned to the ground and torn open . While they were still alive ? Quite possibly . Each case , the wounds have stayed essentially the same . The same area is generally torn , same parts eaten , same mode of attack . This suggests it 's the same animal . But in each successive killing , the wounds have been deeper . The truck driver was killed with a small claw , maybe three inches . The kids seem to have been torn by a larger one , maybe six or seven inches . But these bodies ... They look like they 've been torn by a scythe . What do you think ? Either there 's more than one , or else it 's growin ' ... Growin ' real fast .

Well , according to the sheriff , I 've already got a half dozen murders on my head , so what 's one more ? Fine . Huh . So what are you gonna do ? About what ? The fever . Huh ? What do you know about it ? Everything . I designed it . Ha ! [ Gasps , laughs ] Hi , honey . How are you doing ? Good . Oh , finally got the last of the bodies down . I ain 't seen nothing like this since Beirut . How 's that hippie girl doing ? Oh , Dr. raven says she 's doing fine . Just a little shocked . She 's also got a temperature , and so 's everybody else . I mean , his clinic is full . So he 's treating her at doc 's trailer . Must be something bad going around . I have a touch of it myself , and the girls . Seems like we have a fever . Why didn 't you tell me ? Oh , honey , I figured you had enough to worry about . Now listen ... listen to me . Now , you go in that bedroom , and you rest with the girls , you hear me ? I 'm gonna bring in your breakfast right now . Mmm , you taste good . [ Laughs ] Get in there . Gimme this ! Whoa !

Yes , Susan , what is it ? I really don 't feel very well . I thought I might go home , if that 's all right with you ? Certainly , my dear . Come down here first . I want to check you . What the hell is it ? Hmm . Looks like some kind of lizard . [ Screeching ] That 's what I thought . But ... but it came out of a damn chicken egg , and it 's grown threefold since this morning .

Susan , keep this under your tongue for just a second . That 's it . Right on time . What is it ? Oh , it 's just a little over 100 . How are you feeling now , Susan ? Um , a little worse , I 'm afraid . We 'll take care of that . I 'm gonna have you take just a little lie down . I just feel so ... so cold . Yes . It was just a little chill . Come on . We 'll cover you good and warm you up in just a second . There you go . I wish I could have spared you this , Susan . Spared me what ? Right now , your body is an evolutionary battlefield . What 's wrong with her ? Just be patient , and you 'll see . Please help me . [ Moans ] I 'm going to help you . I 'm going to help you understand . With understanding comes acceptance .

Where did these come from ? I made them . You made them ? What , did you lay ' em yourself ? Recombinant DNA , poultry retroviruses , ostrich RNA samples ... Genetic ... genetic engineering forms ? Why didn 't I see any of this ? Why didn 't I get any of this ? It never came across my desk . I 'm gonna have your ass for this , Vogel . I assure you , we knew nothing . What the hell did you think she was doing ? Chickens , chickens ... She was working on chickens . Jane Tiptree , the fairy godmother of military biotech , the woman that can think 50 unthinkable thoughts before breakfast , building a better chicken ? All she asked was that we be quiet . She wanted no publicity there . Yeah , sure . She knew if we saw her name on any of the research dockets , we 'd be all over her . I don 't know what you gentlemen are talking about , but someone called in a code blue . I 'd like to know why . Less than 72 hours ago , a truck driver was attacked and killed by a wild animal not too far from here . The blood of the truck driver contained a molecular configuration , a trademark , a trademark registered to Eunice . We believe it 's some kind of virus . Our job is to determine what it is and with the power vested in us by the federal emergency management authority , execute any and all necessary steps . - All right , all right ... - It hurts ! It hurts ! Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Just hang in there , Downey , you 're gonna be okay . Just hang on . We 're uh ... you probably just got a hold of one of them bad eggs , that 's all , don 't worry about it now . I 'm gonna take you to the county hospital . We 're gonna take good care of you , all right ? - [ Crying ] - Oh sh ... hey , look , here we go . The calvary 's here already . You don 't have to wait one more minute . [ Sobbing ] Okay , hang in there . Man , am I glad to see you guys . I 've got a very , very sick woman here . She 's in the back . This area 's under federal quarantine ... Sir ! Oh ! We 've got a live one ! Easy ! We have to get her out . Get her out of there ! Okay , be very careful with her . She ... she ain 't feeling too well . Hang in there , Downey ! Hey , is she gonna be all right ? Well okay , I 'm gonna head back into town then , and you have Downey give me a call when she 's feeling better . I 'll get Annie to fill in for her when she 's feeling ... move . [ Dramatic music ] * The earth was not made for us . She was made for the dinosaurs . The earth was scaled to their dimensions ...

Make a great theme park . Just out of curiosity , why ? Why ? Oh ... Oh ... [ Sighing ] Why ? Well , just imagine : An ugly , cancerous , gray planet , littered with the dying remnants of biological life as we know it . I actively worked on that in industry and in government . Mm-mm .

Barring the discovery of a serum . , we could lose half the species in six months . So that 's it , then ? Not necessarily . Eunice has been working on artificial wombs for years . Artificial wombs ? We have the technology . It would take some time , but we could breed a new generation of females . It might call for some drastic social engineering . With firm leadership , prudent organization , and aggressive fertilization programs , I think the species could survive . I mean , who knows ?

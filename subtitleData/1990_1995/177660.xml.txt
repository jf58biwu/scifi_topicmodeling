This is the greatest little video game I ever seen . [ laughs ] It 's got the Skrulls invading the Earth . Nothing to stop them creepy alien goofballs but yours truly . Yours truly . Mama Grimm 's blue-eyed baby boy . [ laughs ] - Hey . - Let me play with it a while . Oh , yeah ? In your dreams . No , no . I 'm not letting that creep get away with zapping me . - It 's my game , let me have it . - Yeah ? You took the words right out of my mouth . Flame on . Back off , Mr. Heat Rash . Hey , hey , hey . Hold it , you two . Put that sofa down . Now , how many times do I have to tell you , no flame throwing around here ? - I 'm using my shield . - [ grunting ] What is this thing , anyway ? [ Johnny ] It 's just a toy , sis . I found it in the park . It probably belongs to some poor kid . [ chuckling ] Any kid who 'd lose a game with me in it , deserves to lose it . Give me that . We don 't have time for this now . Reed wants us . There 's an important message coming in . Probably Schwarzenegger begging me to be in his next movie . [ Reed ] Ben , Sue , Johnny . You 're just in time . Look , it 's the president . Ow ! I owe you . Dr. Richards , it 's good to see you again . Likewise , Mr. President . Why didn 't he tell us who it was ? [ both ] Shh . [ all ] Hello , Mr. President . Just because I didn 't vote for you don 't mean I ain 't behind you all the way , big guy . [ laughs ] I appreciate that . We have trouble in the North Atlantic . Bay of Fundy , due east of Grand Harbor . The Coast Guard has reported encounters with unknown creatures . We suspect they could be under the control of the Sub-Mariner . Prince Namor . If that weasel is looking for trouble ... If reports are true , this could be the beginning of a global catastrophe . NASA has a satellite tracking station in that area . Yes , and if anything happens to it , our entire surveillance system would be in danger . - We 'll leave right away . - I knew I could count on you . After all , like we say in Arkansas , you guys are stronger than garlic in a mustache . - Is he putting ' us on ? - Quiet . Oh , one more thing . This operation must be secret . No need to alarm the public . Well , you know what that means . [ video game bleeping ] Yeah . I can 't finish playing my game . [ speaking alien language ] [ continues in alien language ] [ laughing ] [ man ] Hold it a second . Excuse me for interrupting . But since some viewers might not speak fluent Skrull , we 'll use our mighty Marvel language converter to bring you up to speed . Great work , Votan . The Fantastic Four believe you were their president . [ laughing ] That " garlic in the moustache " was a nice touch . Just something I heard on a country - western radio station beaming up from Earth . Now , with the Fantastic Four off on a pointless chase in the North Atlantic , we can get on with our plans . Notify Admiral Kah on the mothership hiding behind the Earth 's moon . The Fantastic Four have taken the bait . Commander Lyja , initiate Phase Beta . Yes , Your Majesty . Commence Beta . [ Lyja ] Skrull Earth operatives will now assume the forms of the Fantastic Four , and commit criminal acts to discredit them . - [ alarm sounding ] - [ shouting ] [ man ] Help , it 's the Thing . He 's gone crazy ! [ man ] Excitement is high as the crowd awaits the arrival of the queen , and as Her Majesty gets out of the limousine , she begins to greet her admirers . Oh ! And there 's Sue Storm Richards , one of the beloved Fantastic Four . And ... good grief ! [ man # 2 ] She 's stealing the queen 's tiara ! Sue Richards is a crook ! [ over PA ] Clear taxi strip for takeoff . Experimental jet now airborne . [ pilot ] Something has me . It 's Mr. Fantastic and the Human Torch ? Look out ! Mayday , Mayday ! [ Clinton ] And it is with a very heavy heart that I say we do not know why the Fantastic Four have become criminal menaces . But they must be captured . [ Reed ] Bay of Fundy , dead ahead . - This is the spot . - Everything looks okay . Some emergency . My Aunt Petunia could 've handled this one . Look . [ Sue ] What are they ? Well , they sure ain 't chicken of the sea . Strange , my cybernetic scope is not picking them up . Now here we go again . What 's that supposed to mean ? [ Reed ] They 're not real . They 're some kind of holographic projection . Johnny , take us down . Activate underwater canopies . - [ sonar pings ] - I 'm getting sensor activity . Getting warm ... warmer . There . That 's the image generator . [ Sue ] But why would anyone want us to think those monsters are real ? Okay , big brain . You tell us . [ Reed ] I 'll know more once we get this back to the lab for analysis . [ Thing ] Hey . We got company . [ man ] Ahoy , the Fantastic Four . Ahoy , the Fantastic Four . You are under arrest by order of the President of the United States . Are they kidding ? Come on . Let 's kick some butt . No , we don 't fight our own government . We play this one by the book . It is all going according to plan , Magnificence . Bring up some more prisoners . These are beginning to bore me . Yes , soon we Skrulls shall grind the Earth beneath our heel . And we won 't have to battle the Fantastic Four . Thanks to my brilliance , they have been neutralized by their own Army . [ laughing ] [ Kah ] Now that the Fantastic Four are out of our way , may we proceed with our battle plan ? - Not yet . - What better time ? The forces are gathered and our enemy suspects nothing . Not yet . Until my undercover agents report the Fantastic Four are truly out of action , we cannot launch the attack . Is that clear ? Yes , Your Majesty . I have the most powerful invasión force of all and I 'm compelled to wait on that imperial fool . What do you suggest ? Begin the countdown . If word doesn 't come from the emperor soon , I 'll launch the attack anyway . Begin the countdown . In less than 12 Earth hours , we shall dominate this planet , while the Fantastic Four remain helpless in prison . [ laughing ] [ Reed ] This bizarre chain of events was no accident . It 's time to take action . Sue , Johnny , Ben , can you hear me ? - I 've got you . - Loud and clear . Yeah , I hear you . But a fat lot of good it does me . The president is convinced we 've gone crazy and turned destructive . [ Sue ] The way Ben behaved when they got us , who can blame him ? [ Ben ] Oh , come on . So I punched out a couple of stone walls , big deal . [ Johnny ] Somebody framed us . But who and why ? I don 't know , Johnny , but we have to get out of here and stop them . I found my way out . You three know what to do . We 'll rendezvous at Site Seven . We must clear our names . Hey , the Fantastic Four . You think we can hold them ? Are you kidding ? This joint 's escape proof . [ Reed ] Sorry , I really must be going . [ guard ] Jailbreak ! Jailbreak , help ! This should do the trick , I hope . It 's all right , the prisoner 's still here . [ Sue ] We 're still missing Johnny . [ Reed ] Don 't worry , darling . He 's resourceful . - He 'll find a way . - [ buzzing ] Flame on . Seal the perimeter cells ! - [ alarm sounds ] - They 're playing my song . [ grunting ] - [ alarm ringing ] - [ barking ] [ Reed ] The alien generator . The police didn 't impound it . They evidently didn 't know what it was . Watch . It duplicates life forms . Wow , that image generator is cool . I bet it could knock out some fantastic babes . Where did it come from ? I 'm not sure . But this is the hallmark of some highly evolved alien culture . If you 're talking buggy-eyed monsters from outer space , why didn 't you just say so ? Whoever they are , they must have created exact replicas of each of us and sent them out to commit crimes . [ Reed ] As easily as this . Get out of here . And they did this to get us out of the way . But why ? - So , what happens next ? - Right , Stretch-o . Come on , you 're the leader . Start leading . This device came from outer space . - Do we have anything going out there ? - The Andromeda space shuttle . - It 's being launched tonight . - That 's it . Here , put these on . This is embarrassing . People will think I 'm covering a zit or something . These are translingual patches I 've developed . They will translate any alien language we encounter by applying a molecular conversión isotope ... [ Thing ] Hey . Why do we have to fight anybody when you can talk them to death . [ Johnny ] Look . If I didn 't know I was here , I 'd swear that was me . It 's an alien form made to look like you . Follow us , but stay out of sight . Flame on . [ Reed ] Now , to talk to the alien Torch . Hello . I thought you were going after the hospital . We came to tell you that plans have changed . Okay . After I toast this rocket , I 'll be right with you . No . We 're not destroying anything else . Your orders are to come with us . - Where 'd you get this vehicle ? - It belongs to the real Four . It ain 't much to look at , but it gets the chicks . We have to return to our checkpoint and report to high command . Whatever you say . Why are you keeping your phony forms ? - Uh , well ... - We were told to keep these identities until ordered to change . Well , maybe I should too . Give me the location of the checkpoint , and I 'll punch it into the computer . Thirty-seven degrees north latitude , 140 degrees west longitude . - But you should know that . - I forgot , so sue me . We 're alone , unarmed and heading into an alien power base . Hey , if being a superhero was easy , any bozo could do it . [ Kah ] I 'm tired of waiting . My troopers are at their peak . If we don 't go now , we 'll lose our advantage . Give the orders . [ over PA ] Admiral Kah , you must not attack until I give the command . The Fantastic Four have escaped . My operatives will now launch a reign of terror and once the Four are executed for it , it will be safe to invade . [ alien Torch ] There 's the checkpoint . My three comrades are there , but you ... Comrades , we 've been betrayed ! Well , that 's nothing to what you 're going to be . [ Sue ] Reed , he 's changing into a ... a creature . - Transform , comrades . - [ growling ] Johnny , get them . Come here , Dino . One for the money , two for the show . Now you did it , you big , dumb schmo . Start talking . What 's going on ? [ Reed ] Based on what the Skrull told me , I 'll pay a call on the mothership . Alien ship approaching southeast quadrant . [ alarm sounding ] Ah , it 's Operative Kok Nal , the one who assumes the form of Mr. Fantastic . Operative Kok Nal has returned , Magnificence . Excellent . I want his report . And so , Your Majesty , we must not launch the attack . What ? Don 't be ridiculous . The Four are no longer a threat to us . The Four are only the front line of defense . - Earth has much more powerful forces . - You have proof of this ? Insert this in your holographic system . What it shows is only the tip of the iceberg we 're up against . These hideous creatures could devastate our brave forces . Reed 's showing them scenes from old monster movies . Yes , let 's hope the Skrulls don 't watch Saturday morning TV . As you can see , Your Majesty , it would be suicide to go against such powers . - Imperial Guard . - [ footsteps ] Maybe they 've seen the reruns . Storm Trooper Votan ? Yes , Your Highness . I hereby present Operative Kok Nal with the Imperial Order of the All-Conquering Nakdal for meritorious service to the Crown . [ all ] Nakdal ! Please accept my personal Nakdal , operative . Coming from you , commander , this is indeed a Nakdal to remember . Operative Kok Nal , you will now return to Planet Skrull with the other three operatives from Earth . I will debrief you , myself . - Uh-oh . - Now what ? We 're in deep doo-doo . My emperor , I am afraid I cannot do as you ask . - What ... ? - [ all ] What ? Back on Earth , every trace of the Skrull invasión plan must be eradicated . It is my duty to prevent retaliation from the Earth forces you witnessed . - Trooper Votan ! - Yes , Your Majesty ? Give Kok Nal the ultimate High Grand award for bravery beyond Skrullness . Yes , Your Highness . And give him three more of those medals for the boys back on Earth . Kok Nal ? You 're a skrull Skrull . Thank you . I must return to Earth now , to make certain I deserve these high tributes . Farewell . Call me . Gee . Plastic . They are distracted . Transform . [ bleating ] Hey , the Skrulls ! Gangway . It 's clobberin ' time . No need . [ Reed ] My hypno-suggestion ray transmits orders that can 't be resisted . How do we know they 'll stay that way ? The hypno-ray told them they like being goats . [ all laughing ] Soon as we get back , I 'll contact the president and set him straight about what 's happened . [ speaking alien language ] Has the invasión started ? Are we winning ? Give me my game . - What do you mean , your game ? - Huh ? I know just what to do with this . Uh , here , son . Uh , enjoy the game . [ alien language ] What are you doing ? Unhand me . I am an officer of the Imperial Skrull Expeditionary Force . I shall reduce your planet to ashes . Do you hear me ? Does anybody hear me ? Hey ! Put me down . I will laser bomb your village ... [ muttering ] ¶ There 's Galactus looking hungry ¶ And Doctor Doom is near ¶ Here come the Skrulls invading ¶ Do you run and hid in fear ? ¶ No way , no way No way ¶ Just call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four - That 's all , no more . - Now that 's grammatical . ¶ Reed Richards is elastic ¶ Sue can fade from sight ¶ Johnny is the Human Torch ¶ The Thing just loves to fight ¶ Call the Four ¶ Fantastic Four

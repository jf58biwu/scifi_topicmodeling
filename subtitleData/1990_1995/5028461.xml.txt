 Magna Volt , the final word in auto security . No embarrassing alarm noise , no need to trouble the police . And it won 't even run down your battery . CASEY : On the international scene , the Amazon Nuclear Power Facility , has blown its stack , irradiating the world 's largest rain forest . Environmentalists call it a disaster . But , don 't they always . In national news , Attorney General Marcos today approved the ED 209 Combat Unit , for deployment in five American cities , despite widespread complaints of malfunction . The surgeon general is dead , gunned down 20 minutes ago by a militant addict of the deadly designer drug , Nuke . The greatest health threat facing our nation ... Nuke , the most addictive narcotic in history . A plague that ... WOMAN : Get some help ! MAN : Nuke ! Nuke ! This station has just received the following transmission from Cain , convicted murderer and leader of the Nuke cult . People want paradise . And they will have it . FEMALE ANNOUNCER : The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by Cain , following the fire-bombing of a drug treatment clinic , that left five dead last week . Following the latest breakdown in negotiations , Detroit 's police today returned to the picket line , demanding better terms from Omni Consumer Products , OCP . The corporation contracted by the city , to run the Detroit Police Department . OCP cut our salaries 40 % and canceled our pensions . And now they refuse to even talk to us . God knows why , but they want this strike . What happened ? Ooh , look what we got . Get up . Hold him ! You put my eye out , you bitches ! Shut up , you fuckhead . You 're breaking my fucking arm . Hurry ! Look at this . What a nasty man . Night 's made . Let 's pay Papa and get us what we need . Nuke me , baby . MAN : I 'll kill you , bitches ! I 'll kill you ! He 's up ! Come on ! You 're shit with a timer , man . Come on ! Come on ! Let 's go ! MAN 1 : I 'll take out an army with this shit ! Let 's load it up and get the hell out of here ! Where 's the bullets for this gun , man , huh ? Third drawer , bottom . Wow ! MAN 2 : We should have brought a truck ! I really like this gun , man . So , just take it and get out . Thanks . I don 't believe this ! What ? It 's the cops man . Cops are on strike , stupid . Can 't you hear that ? You see , what did I tell you ? I 'll fix him . Did you see that ? We got him ! Beautiful . Come on , man , let 's move it . No . One more . Nice shit , man . Fucking cops . Peace officer . Think it over , creep . Nuke . It 's not mine , man ! Where is it made ? It 's not mine , man ! I told you , I 'm clean . Where is it made ? I don 't know , man ! All I know is where I get it ! Freeze . Nobody move . This is a bust . Ladies , stay down . MAN 1 : Somebody ! Open the fridge , damn it ! MAN 2 : Open the door , come on . Can 't shoot a kid , can you , fucker ? " Can 't shoot a kid , can you ? " Throw it home , Dad ! Shut up ! Drop it , or the little shit 's dead ! I 'll blow its fucking head off , man ! Lewis , hang it up . Now , no shit from either one of you ! And don 't try to follow me ! ROBOCOP : We won 't . MAN : The baby 's going with me ! No . I 'll kill it , man ! I 'll do it . I 'll fucking kill it . We can 't have that . Nice shooting . See you , Jimmy . Hi , Mom . Hi . Don 't do it ! No , stop ! Stop it , Alex ! HOLZGANG : OCP defines you as a machine that utilizes some living tissue . You understand that . Yes . And so , uh , do you consider yourself human ? I require an answer . Stop tape . Do you have any idea what you 're doing to that poor woman ? Take a look at her file . Go on . Officer , Mrs. Murphy is bringing suit against OCP . My name is Tom Delaney . I 'm representing her . Up to a few months ago , she wouldn 't leave her bedroom . Then there were the therapists and the hypnotists and the harmonic treatment ... And then you pull this shit . Driving past her house day after day , spying on her , trying to make her think her husband is still alive . DELANEY : She 's barely started to accept the loss . You 're ripping her to pieces . And for what ? Do you think you could ever be a husband to her ? I mean , what can you offer her ? Companionship ? Love ? A man 's love ? No . Roll tape . Are you Alex Murphy ? No . Are you human ? No . You are simply a machine . I am a machine . Nothing more . That 'll do it . Stop tape . Now , you stay there . All right , go get her . Let 's be decent about this . Give them some privacy . I don 't have a problem with that . Alex ? Don 't you know me ? Don 't you remember me ? Alex , it doesn 't matter what they 've done to you . Touch me . It 's cold . They made this to honor him . No . I ... No ... Your husband is dead . I don 't know you . Why is this happening ? I thought all communications systems were the same . I tried to save the company a few bucks . It took two days to download specs from Cleveland . I lost the account . MAYOR : It hardly befits the dignity of my office to have to come to you , Johnson . JOHNSON : My apologies for the slight inconvenience , Your Honor . Twenty minutes in rush hour traffic isn 't slight , not when you 're the mayor of a major American city . All right , let 's get to business . When are you going to start paying the cops so they 'll go back to work ? We 're not a charity . The city owes us over $ 37 million . Well , you 'll have to cut us some slack . A deadline 's a deadline . Sorry . How are we supposed to raise that kind of money with things the way they are ? You aren 't . What the hell is he talking about ? We don 't expect you to pay . Let me refer you to our contract . " In the event of default , " OCP shall have the uncontested right of foreclosure " on all city assets . " You 've signed this ! So you 're saying , we miss one payment , and you can foreclose . We can and we will . We 're taking Detroit private . So you deliberately undermined our credit . That was the easy part . And you engineered the police strike . You want Detroit to tear itself apart so you can raid it like you would any other corporation ? Do you know how many people are dying out there ? You 're murderers . I 'd advise you to say nothing further . It might be actionable . It 's bullshit ! Bullshit , you senile old bastard ! It 's bullshit ! All right , calm down . I think we 'd better get out of here . I 'm okay . I 'm calm . Calm down . I think we 'd better leave . Calm down . Easy . Easy . I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Fine . Good . Good . I 'm in control . Everything is fine . It 's okay . Relax . I 'm fine . One last thing , gentlemen . We will sue your asses ! Give it your best shot . Fuck you , you old , senile bastard ! This is bullshit ! Fuck you . This is bullshit . That 's bullshit ! WOMAN ON PA : OCP 's latest in civilian-control technology ... I 've been very patient , Johnson . Five months ! Who 's that ? Faxx . Dr. Juliette Faxx . Just been moved up to head the attitude adjustment team . Five months . $ 90 million . I want to see some results . JOHNSON : Yes , sir . I 'll show you what we have . OCP pioneered cyborg technology , and now we take a quantum leap forward . State-of-the-art destructive capabilities commanded by a unique combination of software and organic systems . In every way , an improvement over the original . It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you , Robocop 2 . You are under arrest . Stop , or I 'll shoot . Stop , or I 'll shoot . JOHNSON : OCP is proud to present the future of urban pacification , Robocop 2 . Ninety million . They all go crazy . Robots with emotional problems . No , sir . No , sir . Not robots , cyborgs . Cybernetic organisms . We use living human tissue , and that 's our whole problem , sir . The candidates were all fine men , respected police officers . I reviewed their files myself . Sir , police officers may not be the best candidates for our purposes . They 're a physical bunch . They 're macho , body proud . Finding themselves stripped of all that , it 's no wonder they become suicidal . Our one success was a cop . Well , yes , Mr. Johnson . Alex Murphy . Top of his class , devout Irish Catholic , family man . Everything in his profile indicates a fierce sense of duty . That 's probably what kept him alive . With all due respect , Dr. Faxx , your area of expertise is psychology , not robotics . There 's no harm in hearing the young lady out , is there , Johnson ? No , sir . Thank you , sir . I believe that Murphy 's case was unusual but not unique . We can find someone else , someone to whom the prospect might even be desirable . I 've never met anyone who wanted to be a robot . Well , it would require a screening process , one I 'd be happy to supervise . The cost would be negligible , and , uh , it would be a shame to waste all the work that 's been done , wouldn 't it ? It certainly would , my dear . Go do it . Report to me directly . Yes , sir . You could learn a thing or two from that girl , Johnson . CROWD : ... not for me . Decent wages , decent cops ! Decent wages ... Hey ! ... decent cops ! The union 's got a list ! We ain 't forgetting ' who you are ! One at a time . Please , one at a time . That 's the best we can do . Hello , ladies . - uh ! They 've taken out three of them , Leon ! They won 't be fucking with any more cops . They won 't be fucking with nobody , man . Those cops will die . Bullshit ! Bullshit ! Yeah . GIRL 1 : Hey ! Hey ! GIRL 2 : How 're you doing , Hob ? ROBOCOP : Hob . That 's him . Thank you . Nuke me . HOB : Go ahead , take two . There 's plenty of Nuke to go around . I 've lost him . HOB : Boy , you haven 't been around here in a while . This one 's on me . ROBOCOP : Five degrees , south-southwest . There 's the little darling . Good eyes , Murphy . Good as money can buy . HOB : Ferdy , you got out . Well , I 'll tell Cain , okay ? Better have something to give me this time , Officer . One cop per car . Okay , these are the routes . Three cars . One cop per car ? That 's right . Sitting ducks . We set up three snipers , and that 's all it takes . Pay the man . All right . Thank you . Hey , you didn 't count it . That 's all right . You should really count it , you know . It 's okay . Give him something to help him with his conscience . No . That 's all right . I don 't really want it . Come on , Duffy . I know you need it . The kid goes wild Rebel alone Heart of a stone The kid goes wild Isn 't this a school day ? MAN : Cops ! Hey ! Shit . No . Freeze ! Turn around . Put your hands up . Shit . Officer Duffy , have a seat . You look a little out of breath , bitch . You 've sold us out , Officer Duffy . What are you talking about ? Where is Cain ? I don 't know any Cain . No ! Where is Cain ? I don 't know ! Where is Cain ? I told you . I don 't know ! He pulled his pistol And demanded his pay They say he shot that man Through the head No passion Now bad young Billy 's got the law on his trail ROBOCOP : Where ? River Rouge . The old sludge plant . You 're a rotten cop . Go . You . You want me ? Dead or alive . Then one of us must die . Dead , then . Jesus had days like this . Hounded and attacked like a criminal . But like Him I don 't blame you . They program you and you do it . I will kill you . You just tried . And I forgive you . Why 'd you stop ? You got it cracked . I 'm tired . HOB : They say he 's got a brain , I wanna to see it . You think it was me that beat you ? It wasn 't . It was this . CATZO : It 's too tough . Try here , at the joint . CATZO : Yeah ! Ha ! Look at that ! Hey , come on , cut it out . How does it taste ? MAN 1 : What the hell is going on ? MAN 2 : Man , just look at him . Christ , he 's been stripped . HOLZGANG : Let 's not get carried away here . We 're talking about a piece of equipment . Don 't tell me he can 't suffer . Just look at him . It 's ... It 's electrical . Bullshit . I know every inch of him . Every circuit , every living nerve . His pain centers are alive . They 're lit up like Christmas trees ! Nah , the backup generator 's just making him twitch . He 's suffering ! How long can he last ? No way of knowing . Got him on minimal life-support . Keeping the brain going with microshocks . It 's damn tricky . He could be going any time . Move ! Move ! What 's happening in here ? OCP is happening . These bastards won 't lift a finger to help him . This unit needs millions of dollars in parts . You can 't expect authorization for that kind of cash outlay overnight , be reasonable . If you don 't fix him , it 's murder . Now , settle down , honey , I 'm doin ' you people a favor just by talkin ' to you . You son of a bitch . He 's in hell . Come on ! FEMALE OFFICER : Fix him . We 'll be in touch . DUFFY : Man , you guys are the greatest . Did you see their faces ? " We 're gonna throw away the key , Duffy . " So , uh , the cops didn 't give you too much trouble , did they ? Usual shit-parade . You know . They 'll never prove anything . Hey , want some ? Hey , I 'm a minor . Don 't want to break any laws . Here , you take it . God , I just love you guys ! What happened ? Hey , where are we going ? Hey , come on , guys . This just isn 't funny , man . God , my head . My head 's sort of killing me . Wait a minute ? What ... Hey , Cain . Hey , it 's ... It 's good to see you . Thanks for gettin ' me out . I can 't get up . You noticed that one . Look , Cain , I don 't know what that kid told you ... You told them , Duffy , you told them where we were . No , that 's not true . HOB : We know all about it , Duffy . You think you 're the only cop we have ? Shit ! Cain , Cain , come on . Look , I 'm begging you , man . Look , I 'll do anything . Okay . You 're kiddin ' , right ? Yeah , you 're just kiddin ' . You 're just scaring ' me . You taught me a lesson , man . I 'd never fuck with you . Because I really love you guys , I really , I really do . Shut up . Look , I 've been loyal I know shit that I still haven 't even told you , Cain . You deserve this , Duffy . Cain might have been killed . DUFFY : Okay , okay . You know , maybe you ought to have the kid leave . Why ? What ? Why would we have the kid leave ? That 's a good touch . That 's a good touch . " Have the kid leave . " " Have the kid leave . " " Why ? " Come on , ' cause this is just over . Hey , come on , Cain . Come on , man , what are you doin ' ? No ! Come on . You said you were just going to scare him ! Doesn 't he look scared ? I can 't believe you 're even contemplating this . It hardly matters what you believe , Mr. Schenk . But , these are criminals ! They 're maniacs ! You 're ... You 're given to premature value judgments . All right , it may be true . The subjects are socially misaligned . Socially misaligned ? These are death-row inmates ! And of no use to society , Schenk . We need a subject who 'll welcome the power , the virtual immortality we offer . Now , I really think this is a good place to start looking . You 're out of your mind . Is that your professional opinion ? Yes , goddamnit ! It is ! Yes ! And you are not using my lab to put that kind of a brain into my cyborg ! We 'll dearly miss you here . You 're the one that 's going to be out of a job . I 'm going to take this directly to Johnson . He 's just been waiting for an excuse to get you fired . Good morning , sir . I 'm sorry to bother you this early . You seem agitated . Well , frankly , I 'm ... I 'm shocked . Mr. Schenk just called . It seems Dr. Faxx has begun screening candidates for the Robocop 2 project . So I understand . It 's very exciting . She 's screening psychotics , sir . Murderers . Well , we aren 't planning to build a toy , Johnson . Faxx knows what she 's doing . She 's keeping Robocop offline . It 's a public relations disaster . You 've got to learn to look at the larger picture . The foreclosure . You must know how important that is to us . Yes , sir ... With Robocop out of commission , the chaos down there will increase , and so will the odds of the city will fall into our hands . Yes , sir , but a competent executive would find a way to deal with the corporate image problem . Couldn 't agree with you more , Mr. Johnson . Fortunately , I have found a way . Yes , Miss Faxx and I have already discussed it . I know you 'll help to implement her ideas . Of course , sir . Whatever I can do . Anything else ? FAXX : Coffee ? No , thank you . Don 't forget your shoes on the way out . He 's my patient . He 's critical . I 've got to stay with him . MAN : We 'll let you know when we need your services . Nobody on your staff has my experience with him . You need me ! We don 't need anybody . " We " , who the hell are " we " ? You 're a goddamn lawyer . You don 't know anything about him ! You 're exactly this far from getting fired , babe . Shyster ! He 's one of mine . I want him back on his feet . Well , maybe he will be or maybe we 'll just sell the parts for scrap . That 's up to us . You see , Robocop 's off warranty . Robocop 's command program , his , uh , his set of directives , it determines his behavior . It 's time to update the program , and I would like to hear from each one of you . WOMAN : It 's about time they asked us . Well , we 're getting a lot of heat , and I mean a lot of it , from the parent 's groups and personally , I don 't blame them . I 'm a parent myself . WOMAN : All that destructive behavior . He 's become a role model for our children . Now what are we teaching them ? You have a point . If he 'd just talk things out with people instead of firing that big gun of his . Couldn 't he take a little time to address environmental issues ? Excuse me , what was that ? He could speak out on environmental issues . Don 't see any reason why not . For all the shooting he does , I 've never once seen him take the time to do anything nice , like , um , visit an orphanage . JOHNSON : You 're absolutely right . Or help a cat out of a tree or ... Or go door to door , collecting for the red cross or maybe even , uh , roasting some marshmallows with some cub scouts . Why , Mr. Johnson , that is wonderful . Thank you so much . It 's no good . The program isn 't uploading . He 's resisting . There 's too much data . No. lt 's him . Leave him to me . I can 't , it 's not going to work ! You 're wasting valuable time . Don 't resist this . Let me up . I must go . Go where ? Do what ? Go dancing ? Fall in love ? What is it you think you are ? Alex Murphy . That 's a delusion . It 's a glitch in your system . Alex Murphy is dead . You take away the plastic and metal and wires , and you 're just a couple of chunks on a coroner 's table . You 're not even a corpse . What are you ? Respond . I am Officer Alex Murphy . Detroit Police Department . That won 't do . What are you ? Robocop . Crime Prevention Unit , OCP . Better . Much better . I type it . You think it . You type it . I think it . What a wonderful opportunity you represent . Psychotherapy , it 's such a ... It 's a slow , clumsy practice , but with you this is so simple , direct . You know , you 're really very lucky . We can do in moments , with you , what would take years with a human patient . I 'm really very lucky . You 're free . You 're free from doubt , free from having to make painful choices . I am free . He 's ready . Uploading command program . I am so glad we had this chance to dialog . Look at you , it 's like you 're brand new . Thank you , thank you . You really had us worried there , Murphy . I 'm touched . Get this guy . He 's touched . That 's enough all of you back to your posts , come on . Let 's go ! How 're you feelin ' , Murphy ? I 'm just fine , Warren , thank you for asking . Let 's get you downstairs . I want to see if those amateurs at OCP screwed up . Pity . It 's a beautiful morning . Shame to waste it . Ready for duty , partner ? You betcha . Let 's go . Nothing I 'd rather do . He 's sounds terrific . Something 's wrong . Harder ! It 's Robo ! Everybody out the back door ! Get out ! BOY : It 's locked ! GIRL : It won 't open ! Murph , wake up , will ya ? Good morning . LEWIS : Come on , take him out . Robo . I think we should talk . What 's with you , Murph ? Where 'd they go ? They 're still here . The little bastards . Hands up , let 's go . Everybody up . Move it , up against the wall . Let 's go . Hands on top of your heads . Nobody move . ROBOCOP : You are under arrest . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . He 's dead , Murphy . You have the right to an attorney . You 're reading Miranda to a corpse . I 'm having trouble . My ... This isn 't very nice . Though you may think you are having fun now , you only hurt the one you love . Think of Mom and Dad . What kind of a lesson are you teaching them ? And now , a word on nutrition . Shit , he 's fucked up . Bad language makes for bad feelings . BOY : Let 's go . The point is ... We all have to work ... I haven 't finished . Hit the gas , Murphy . The posted limit is 35 . We should set an example , Anne . Your hair looks lovely that way . It 's OCP . They did something to you . I 'm fine . Isn 't the moon wonderful tonight ? It 's still daytime . It 's the thought that counts . Jesus . We 're heading back to the station , that 's all there is to it . CHILDREN : Hey ! Robo ! Robocop , what the hell are you doing ? Waste makes haste , for time is fleeting . A rolling stone is worth two in the bush . Go fuck a refrigerator , pecker-neck ! Bad language makes for bad feelings . You 're nuts ! Murphy , come on . Let 's go . Come on . Back ! Thank you for not smoking . WOMAN : Well , there it is . It 's OCP . They screwed him up . He must be going out of his mind . It 's not as if he can 't just say no . They 've put all this nonsense into his brain . He has to obey . Take them out . All of them . WOMAN : It can 't be done . Not with this equipment . Are you saying there 's no way ? I can 't believe that . Well , sure , there are ways . You can pull his cranial circuits . Yeah , which would shut down his life-support system altogether . We could run a few thousand volts through him , pray his insulation holds . It would probably kill him . No ! MALE OFFICER 1 : I 'll get some help ! Get him inside ! MALE OFFICER 2 : Come on ! Move it ! MALE OFFICER 3 : Come on . Come on . Don 't touch him . He 's hot ! Use your jackets ! Why in hell did he do that ? OCP gave him crazy commands . He fried himself to get rid of them . Nice and easy . MALE OFFICER 4 : He weighs a ton . MALE OFFICER 5 : Yeah . He sure does . That 's it ! For all he 's been through . MALE OFFICER 5 : Get out of the way ! MALE OFFICER 6 : Move out ! You think he 's alive ? MALE OFFICER 5 : I don 't know . He 's pretty hot . Put me down . Put him down now . MALE officer 5 : All right , come on , stand him up ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Here it is . Are we cops ? What 's bugging you , Murph ? Cain . Cain 's bugging me . CAIN : We have only just begun , my flock . Soon we will expand from city to city . The rich and the poor alike will know a paradise for every moment of their lives . There 's a Nuke for every mood . We 'll offer our customers the opportunity to control every aspect of their emotional lives . You know , with the White Noise and the Black Thunder , and the Red Ramrod , and , uh , the Blue Velvet . Frank , the Blue Velvet . I think it 's ready , sir . Thank you , Frank . Frank , the Benzedrine 's got my teeth wiggling . Cut it with ... Scopolamine . Five mil 's per . Yes , sir . Made in America . Yeah , we 're gonna make that mean something again . Hey , cops ! Huh ? What ? Cops ! And they ain 't carryin' no picket signs ! They going to kick somebody 's ass ! MALE OFFICER 1 : Let 's go ! Give me your hand , goddamnit ! Get down . MALE OFFICER 2 : Watch behind ! MALE OFFICER 3 : Get him in the back . Nice . Fuck ! Run ! Get out ! Bomb ! Get down ! MAN : You son of a bitch ! $ 500 million in cash , Nuke money seized by police . But State Attorney Sphincter won 't let the bankrupt city government touch it . Coming up next , threats from the police union and cheers from the public as Metro North cops go back to work and apprehend the Nuke lord , Cain , who may not live to stand trial . They say 20 seconds in the California sunshine is too much these days , ever since we lost the ozone layer . But that was before Sunblock 5000 . Just apply a pint to your body and you 're good for hours . See you by the pool . FEMALE NARRATOR : Sunblock 5000 . Protection for the new age . FAXX : Subject is violently antisocial , given to delusions of godhood , and is hopelessly addicted to narcotics , which offers us a simple and infallible method of ensuring his obedience . You 're perfect . And I must have you . What the hell are you talking about ? It 's like you don 't even care . Just do what I say , Angie ! He 'd want us to come for him ! Look ! Just forget about it 'cause it 's not gonna happen ! I 'm through arguing with you ! And I 'm not asking for your permission ! Cain is in the hospital and we are going to get him . You really just thought this out now , haven 't you ? What about the cops ? We 've got guns ! Damn it , Hob ! Cain needs us . Fuck Cain ! He 'd kill you if he heard you say that . He 's not gonna kill anybody . You heard the news . Shit , he 's probably dead already . You just shut the hell up ! You mouth off like that again and it 's no more Nuke for you , bitch . Damn it , Hob , you know that 's not fair . Now , come on . It 's been a bad time . Sure has . You 're really hurting . Yes , so I 'm hurting . You 're gonna get the shakes soon , Angie . You got it bad . You little bastard . You just do what I tell you from now on , Angie . Start the motor and drive . He 'll kill you . He 'll kill us both . Fuck him . You 're a mess . I got good news for you . You 're gonna have a chance for immortality , as long as nothing happens to that lovely brain . Dr. Weltman ? It 's Faxx . I 'm afraid we lost our patient . Yeah , he just expired . Contact the organ harvest team . Make it fast . We 've got six minutes before the brain 's useless . Night . SURGEON : Come on , come on . Let 's move it . We 've only got five minutes . Lock it up . NURSE : I 've got things set up . Okay , temperature ? Optimum . Move the screen in a little closer . I can 't read it . How 'd we get this one ? Well , Faxx found him . He volunteered . Volunteered ? Big-hearted guy . Yeah . It 's not the heart we 're after , though . Here we go . Mmm . Speaking of hearts , how 's Eileen ? Christ ! Does everybody know ? All right , hold your breath . And showtime . It 's nice and clean in here . There 's no damage . Well , here we go . Easy ... NURSE : We got it . Here it comes . Thing of beauty . SURGEON : Excellent . I don 't know about the rest of you , but I 'm hungry . Thank you ! Thank you ! Yes ! Yes ! " Spider Baby " Stalinski ! He 's come out for Detroit and now you come out for him . The lines are open . Waiting for your pledge . If you want honest government , government that works for you , I 'm asking you to dig deep into your pockets . I 'm asking you to give whatever you can spare ! Where does that put us , Gilly ? Hi . Yes , ma 'am . Hello ! This is Mayor Kuzak . Could you turn down your set , please ? Your Honor , I have some very good news for you . I think the city is saved . Now , you listen very carefully . COUNCILMAN : it 's no bluff . Someone 's shown up to bail the city out . A rival corporation . The mayor isn 't saying and whoever it is , is taking great pains to keep their identity a secret . They 're paying in cash , and they 're not moving the money through the banks . Thank you , Councilman . That will be all . You know , once you guys take over ... Your services to OCP will be rewarded . If the city can pay , we 'll be humiliated . I think it 's worse than that , sir . We shifted 80 % of our liquid resources to the Urban Pacification Plan . If we can 't foreclose , public confidence in OCP will plummet , so will our stock . Sir , if I may ? There 's another option . We certainly have the surveillance capabilities to follow the mayor . It all depends on how far we 're willing to go . If anything went wrong ... As I said , sir , it all depends how far we 're willing to go . We have no legal recourse . There must be no witnesses . Know that you 've gone too far ! Schenk , check your blood pressure . You can get me fired if you want to . You are not bringing illegal drugs into my lab ! I will do worse than get you fired . Now leave me alone . Such terrible pain . You don 't remember me , but you do remember this , don 't you ? And we have it . All the Nuke you 'll ever need . - uh , uh-uh . Not so fast . I need you to do something for me first . Then the pain stops . Good boy . I don 't like this . I think we better get out of here while we can . I know what I 'm doing . If you have any cash , now 's the time to put it in your shorts . That 's just plain rude . I wonder if any of you could help me ? I 'm looking for a Mr. Hob . So , how much you need ? Money , I mean . Well , our current debt to OCP is , uh ... Bob ? $ 37,480,91 1 . Guess you 're in some pretty deep shit . Well , we need all the help we can get , young man . Tell you what , put me down for 50 , just to make sure . Fifty says , $ 50 . That 's cute . Don 't be a queer . Fifty million . This is bullshit . Let 's get out of here . Good God . HOB : Gentlemen ? Well ? Will 50 do it ? Yes , yes , yes . That 'll do it . Don 't you guys think that 'll do it ? Yeah . Fifty mil . That will do it . That 'll do . For God 's sake , Marv , these people are criminals ! Why do you have to label people ? I hate labels ! You shut up . But we cannot capitulate in the war on crime . I 'd be voted out of office . And I don 't think anyone wants that . War on crime 's fine with us . It 's business we 're talking ' about here . Do you have any idea how many people we employ ? You know , I ... I never thought about it like that . Sharp kid . So , your war on crime . You wanna win it or what ? We 're the only chance you have . Listen to him . He 's got it all worked out . Why do people do crimes ? Why ... Why ... Drugs ? People do drugs . HOB : ' Cause they want drugs . The kind that cost too much . Nuke gives high quality at a cheap price . And if you get off our backs , we 're gonna make it cheaper . And safer . We don 't go shoving our shit down anybody 's throat . And we don 't advertise it like they do with cigarettes or booze . So leave us alone and anybody who wants it , gets it . HOB : So no more crimes . You get to be the mayor who cleaned up Detroit . He 's got a point . Don 't you think he 's got a point ? Yeah , he 's got a point . What the hell is that ? MAYOR : Get out ! Get out ! Marv . Cain ! Wow ! You look great . Ooh . It 'll take some getting used to , but ... It 'll be great , Cain . Lie still . I 'm cold . You are going into shock . I will call for a medical emergency unit . Wait . No . Don 't leave me . I won 't leave you . Who did this ? It was big , bigger than you . It was Cain . I 'm gonna die . You know what that 's like , don 't you ? It really sucks . Yes . CASEY : 1 3 dead in what appears to be a Nuke money massacre . Among the victims , two city councilmen . Was the city trying to strike a deal with the drug lords ? No comment , I said , I have no comments ! Now no comments on these allegations . These were men who served this city tirelessly . However , I make a promise to the people of Detroit City , that no effort will be spared to investigate this thoroughly . But Mr. Mayor ... I 'm sorry , no more questions . CASEY : Our own Mayor Kuzak . Now let 's go live to Jess . JESS : And here it is , the Civic Centrum , OCP 's 1 00-story gift to the Motor City . While debate continues over OCP 's hostile takeover , there 's no denying the mood down here is festive . Citizens interviewed on the scene expressed excitement and hope that OCP will make good on its promise of a better life in Detroit . Press . Sorry , folks . Media only . TV and press only . You 'll have to step back . FEMALE REPORTER : There he is ! Right there . MALE REPORTER 1 : Can OCP bring industry back to Detroit ? MALE REPORTER 2 : Sir , can a corporation own a city ... Does OCP own the city ? You gonna hold elections ? You 'd make us all OCP employees ? Why aren 't you going to City Hall ? Just a minute . MALE REPORTER 3 : What about the civil rights ? I 'll answer that , young lady . City Hall is the decaying symbol of mismanagement and corruption . You get that ? This magnificent structure will be the seat of leadership for the new Detroit . And what better place for a clean , fresh start ? OLD MAN : And so , people of the press , city officials , in a few minutes , Omni Consumer Products and the troubled city of Detroit will join in a bold new venture . Now , I 'd like to explain just what this will mean . Sometimes , we just have to start over from scratch to make things right , and that 's exactly what we 're going to do . We 're going to build a brand-new city where Detroit now stands , an example to the world . My friends , welcome to our city as it should be . And as it will be in the hands of responsible private enterprise . And a special welcome to Mayor Kuzak and the outgoing administration . We 're not going anywhere . Your Honor . You 'll have to tear down a lot of people 's houses before you can make that thing , and take away their homes . We 're going to raise towers of glass and steel . Every citizen will have a living unit . Safe , secure , and clean . Now , please , take your seat . Won 't be much room for neighborhoods , huh ? Not like the kind that we all grew up in . These days neighborhoods just seem to be the sort of places where bad things happen . Don 't be nostalgic . What about democracy ? Nobody elected you . Anyone can buy OCP 's stock and own a piece of our city . What could be more democratic than that ? Well , let me tell you there are a lot of people in this town that can 't afford to buy your stock . And they 're not gonna let you get away with this . You haven 't been following the polls . Sit down . OLD MAN : About a year ago , we gave this city Robocop . I think he 's worked out pretty well , but things have become a little rougher out there . And now we need a law enforcement unit capable of meeting the enemy on his own ground , and carrying enough firepower to get the job done . Ladies and gentlemen , with great pleasure , I give you Robocop 2 . Bastards . Maniacs ! What 's the matter ? I can 't believe it . It was them . They sent it . Sent what ? Nothing . OLD MAN : There 's going to be a big call for this unit . And we 'll make him right here in Detroit . That means jobs we can all be proud of and make " Made in America " mean something again . This single container holds enough Nuke to addict a city block . Hundred of these are produced every day and sent to sweatshops where urban slaves prepare this poison for our friends , our loved ones , our children . Now , I say it 's high time we put an end to this plague . Robocop 2 will seek out every laboratory , every dealer , and rid our city of Nuke . Yes . Things will be a lot quieter with this boy around . What 's wrong with him ? It 's nothing , it 's nothing at all . OLD MAN : Turn him off . I can 't . Cain , let 's step outside . You ! Get out of here ! You 're obsolete ! That thing is a killer ! It 's not even armed . It 's harmless . It 's a killer , and I saw it ! Get out of here . Now ! Let me ... No ! No ! Behave yourselves ! What 's the deal here ? Christ knows . It sounds like there 's a war going on in there . You 're coming with me , Cain . MALE REPORTER 1 : There he is ! FEMALE REPORTER : Come on ! MALE REPORTER 2 : Over here ! Are you jealous ... Are you jealous of the replacement ? This could look bad for OCP , Johnson . Scramble the best spin team we have . FEMALE OFFICER : Hustle , hustle , hustle out ! Hustle , hustle , hustle out ! I 'll get you . I 'll get you . MALE OFFICER 1 : Ammo ! Ammo ! Ammo ! MALE OFFICER 2 : Move back ! Move back ! Everybody get out of here . Get down ! Get out ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire , damn it ! All right , let 's get him out of here . MAN 1 : Watch his neck . He 's hurt bad . Easy . Easy . Shit ! I gotta get back . MAN 2 : Move it back ! Move it back ! MAN 3 : Let 's get out of here . Let 's give him what he wants . Goodbye . Serious trouble , sir . So many dead and wounded . Of course there won 't be any trouble from the dead ones . They 'll have relatives . They always do . It 'll be a feeding frenzy . It 's only money . How about criminal proceedings ? Well , uh , we 're looking at major indictments , sir . Prison terms . What about me ? You know we 'll do whatever we can , sir . That 's not good enough , Holzgang . Sir , what if this was all the work of one individual , a person who had her own agenda that wasn 't in sync with the goals of our company ? Well , that usually works . A woman who was not a team player , who violated our trust . MAN : Easy , easy . Well ... We 'd need some evidence to support that . Sir , whether it exists or not , I know I can find it . She did choose the brain , sir . Good thinking . Sir . Thank God you 're all right . I was so worried . I thought it was gonna hurt you . Now , now , it 's over . It 's all over . I failed you . Don 't be hard on yourself . Everything 's going to be all right . Johnson , that business we were talking about , get right on it . Yes , sir . Just look at what they 've done . They are criminals . OCP won 't own this city for long . And I 'll see to that . I will take it to the streets , I will take it to the people . If this is what it 's come to , that businessmen can buy our rights like stock ... FEMALE REPORTER 1 : The Old Man ! MALE REPORTER 1 : He 's leaving ! You don 't realize what we 're losing . FEMALE REPORTER 2 : Give us a statement , sir ! MALE REPORTER 2 : Sir , we have dozens dead . This is an atrocity . Is this your idea of a better life ? FEMALE REPORTER 3 : Was this an experiment of some kind ? MALE REPORTER 3 : That monster was crazy ! How did this happen ? MALE REPORTER 4 : Do you really feel that Robocop ... How do you account for this disaster ? Will OCP make reparations to the victims ? LEWIS : That son of a bitch , he 's getting away with it . We can 't even touch him . Patience , Lewis . We 're only human .

It 's right here , but it 's not gonna do you any good . " Justin Steeps . Age 20 . " See ? - That 's three now . - Three ? Old people who 've died with teenagers IDs on them . Missing teenagers . [ sighs ] You and Lana . You 're always making everything into a big mystery . Well , isn 't it ? There 's no mystery here . Read it . " In case of emergency notify Nathan Steeps . " Keep reading . " Care of Havendell Rest Home . " It 's simple . Who does this body look more like ? A 20-year-old or someone who 'd been living rest home ? You 're saying this is Nathan Steeps ? What other explanation could there be ? The old man probably took his grandson 's ID and his car keys . Why would an old man go drag-racing ? I don 't know . Maybe , he 'd been around for 80 boring years and wanted to go out in a blaze of glory . - Come on . - Alright , alright . Go to the rest home and find out what you can about him . Will that make you happy ? That 'll make me very hap .. [ chime music ] Clark . - What is it ? - Oh , nothing . I just thought I saw somebody I knew . - Excuse me . - Mm-hmm . I 'm here about Nathan Steeps . [ sighs ] [ chimes music ] Can I help you ? Yeah , I think so . I 'd like to speak to someone about Nathan Steeps . I 'm the perfect person to ask . I 'm Nathan Steeps . Justin stays with friends . Different one every few weeks . He doesn 't have much rent money , he 's just a student . Is there any place he spends a lot of his time ? Well , yeah , just the gym . Flawless Form or .. Whatever they call it . He likes to stay in shape . I 'll see what I can find out . If anybody hurt him , I don 't know what I 'd do . Look , I 'm sure he 'll be okay . That 's what the other one said . What other one ? Old woman . About my age , came in a little while ago asking the same questions as you . - Did you get her name ? - You can ask her yourself . She started to feel weak . Said , " I 'm gonna go in and lie down in the rec room . " [ techno music ] ( Matt ) Alright , so , I was wrong about Steeps . - And Lana and me . - Oh , I wouldn 't go that far . You wanted to see me ? I 'm the owner , Adrian Temple . - You can 't be . - Yes . The same guy who did all those ads in the 60s ? Have a flawless form in 12 minutes a day ? I 'm him . - Well , you 'd have be at least- - - Oh , as old as I wanna be . Gentlemen , please . [ techno music ] ( male ) It 's party time . [ engine cranking ] Party time . Aging is something you choose to do . I really believe that . Brittle bones , wrinkles , senility . So much of that is ... cultural . Tell my grandmother that . Uh , about Justin Steeps . I 'll check his record . [ chime music ] Umm , I gotta put some money in the parking meter . [ tires screeching ] - Get out of the track ! - Oh ! [ intense music ] - He 's dead . - Do you know who he is ? He 's wearing Jeff Olton 's jacket . It can 't be Jeff . [ siren wailing ] Lana ? I don 't know how it happened . But Lana , there 's gotta be an explanation . Think . ( Lana ) It happened two days ago . Ready for your rubdown ? I went to workout at Flawless Forms like I always do . Like I always did . Incense . It 'll relax you . [ dramatic music ] Had a little nap , huh ? Yeah , guess I was more tired than I thought . Yeah . Oops , oops , oops . Guess I was really tired . ( Lana ) The next day , I still felt weak . And my hair was grey and my hands had spots on them . And you think that Temple caused this somehow ? It happened to others too . Justin Steeps . Jeff Olton . But how ? I didn 't eat or drink anything while I was there . When I was asleep .. ... maybe .. I don 't know . I really don 't know . What don 't you talk to Clark ? Or Matt or .. Are they still here ? Matt 's with the body , I haven 't seen Clark . I didn 't want them to see me like this . They would 've understood . The way people look at me . The way you look at me . Lana . I told one person Dr. Stern .. ... when it all started happening . - What did she say ? - What could she say ? She took some tests and said she 'd get back with me . Well , that 's a start . We 'll get her here . Then I 'll go talk to Adrian Temple . We 'll both talk to him . Shouldn 't you rest ? And age another 10 years ? At this rate , I only have a few hours left . [ dramatic music ] Let 's go look for some answers in Temple 's office . There 's nothing here to tell us where he 's gone . I 'll be dead by the time we find him . Lana , you 've gotta believe me . We 'll find him . - Lana . - Dr. Stern . How are you feeling ? Same way as I look . I told her to stay home and rest but she wouldn 't listen . I know . I think I might have found something . Remember that trace element I found in your blood ? It 's gold . Or a derivative . I 've been doing some research into .. ... into alchemy . Alchemy ? - Dr. Stern , I don 't have- - - Lana . It 's not hereditary . It 's not a virus . We 're running out of possibilities . But alchemy ? That 's chemistry and magic . The alchemist used gold derivatives in their formulas . And they were always trying to extend life . But this is doing just the opposite . For you , maybe . What is that supposed to mean ? Hold on . Here 's your gold derivative . Then it was Adrian . But only he can tell us how he used it . And he 's gone . I 'll take this to my office and analyze it immediately . Take care of Lana , Dr. Stern . I 'll work with the police in trying to find Temple . ( Dr. Stern ) If there 's a fountain of youth I 'm looking at a drop of it . These golden cells appear indestructible . And they feed on normal red cells . Whoever has this in his bloodstream would need a constant supply of new blood . Blood from young people . Price of immortality . Everybody keeps saying how young Adrian looks . He must have switched his blood with mine when I was unconscious . And now the same thing 's gonna happen to me that happened to the others . Not if I can stop it . Stop it ? What about reversing it ? [ intense music ] [ knocking on door ] - Who is it ? - It 's Sasha . Let me in . Where 's the formula ? I don 't have it . If I don 't have the formula soon .. Now ... where 's the formula ? A doctor named as Stern took it . - Don 't you lie . - I have the address ! [ screams ] Lana ? Stay awake . Lana . [ Lana groaning ] I 'm not dead yet . But soon , my dear . Soon . Now , I want what 's mine . I don 't think so . I want what 's mine ! Ah ! [ Adrian groaning ] [ grunting ] Oh ! [ theme music ] We knew Sasha would lead you here . That 's why we let her listen in . The cure , Temple . Now ! Cure ? Cure . Yeah . I 'd be delighted to cure her . For a price . Your blood . Superboy , no . What happened to me will happen to you . If I can stop this .. ... I have to . With blood like yours in my veins .. ... I may not need anybody else 's for decades . This needs to be kept cold . Your turn . - You 're shaking , Adrian . - Shut up . ( Lana ) Is it really worth it ? Are you that afraid of growing old ? Weren 't you ? I thought I was . That 's enough . Make the exchange . Give me his . [ intense music ] Eternity . Infinity . Forever 's hand in mine . Eternity , infinity , forever 's hand in mine . Now , do it . No , no . Is that a grey hair I see ? Tell me how to help her . Oh , there is no way . I lied . Oh , yes , there is . I read all about it in one of Dr. Stern 's books . You don 't know what you 're talking about . It seems that if an alchemist returns to his true age .. .. his victims become young again . You 're crazy . [ intense music ] This is the way I was before . How did you do this ? Your blood should 've made me young forever . I never said it was my blood . His blood 's still in the cooler . Then whose ? Nathan Steeps . Remember my grandson Justin ? You killed him . You had this all planned . [ Adrian grunting ] Nobody gets this . No ! No ! [ intense music ] [ theme music ]

 [ Announcer ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . Remember me ? You did this ? I thought you were going back to your own planet . There was a revolution . All the aristocrats were killed , slaughtered by farmers and shopkeepers . I 'm the only one left . - I 'm not going to fight ... - I wouldn 't ask you to . I need you to help me stay alive . Will you ? They won 't be happy until I 'm dead , too . They sent a creature after me . That 's why I made this , to contact you . [ sighs ] Well , it 's better than tearing up the street . Much . But if I could find you so easily so could ... that . [ growling ] [ roars ] Ready ? [ grunts ] He 's ice cold , but we didn 't hit him hard enough to ... What are you doing ? Leaving . But you can 't go home . And I can 't stay with you either . We 've been through that before . If you were going to hurt me , you would have done it already . - I don 't want to hurt you . - Not this time . - We 're no longer rivals . - We never were . You 're right . We never were . But we do have other things in common , like character , strength , courage . You were willing to sacrifice yourself last time I was here . I admire that . That 's why I came to you . We don 't have anything in common . Wait . I 'm alone . All alone . I need someone I can trust . What about your own planet , the other aristocrats ? I can 't go back . - You have to help me . - " Have to " ? Please . [ man ] It 's almost too easy . All I had to do was look into her transporter 's frequency . We always knew finding her wouldn 't be the problem . Yes , unfortunately killing her will be . This sure wasn 't in my job description . Clark , is this why you signed up with the bureau ? Well , there were a few things I wanted to get to the bottom of . Once we decontaminate this thing , we oughta lay it right on Jackson 's desk . He 'd still think it was a hoax . You 've been at that window all day , haven 't you ? They 're all gone . Everybody I ever knew . Murdered by animals . If they acted that way , maybe that 's how they were treated . Maybe they were . This is a new place , a new world , filled with new people . - They 're all commoners . - So ? I 'm one . And you said you admired my courage . They 'll be others . [ chuckles ] Come on , you 're coming with me . [ rock music playing ] They 're all so ... happy . Why shouldn 't they be ? [ scoffs ] Why ? Because they 're lives are petty and meaningless . They may not be as strong as you , but they have the same emotion . Can I buy you ladies a drink ? [ scoffs ] I 'm not thirsty . You 're not making this easy , you know . Why should it be easy ? She 'd love a drink , and I 'll just have a soda . Be right back . It wouldn 't hurt to be a little more friendly . It wouldn 't help either . [ sighs ] Don 't be so sure , I think he likes you . But he 's ... a commoner . - Give him a chance . - Why ? Well , maybe because I gave you one . [ sighs ] [ man ] Well , there is one good thing about being a plumber , there 's always plenty of work . So what do you do ? [ Lana ] I 'm working on an internship with a government agency . And you ? An executive maybe ? I ... don 't work . Rich ? She 's looking for work . She 's new here . New ? Where you from ? Uh ... A lot of places . I know what you mean , I 've traveled around a lot myself . It 's tough ... settling in to a new place . - You miss your friends . - You do . There 's a way you can fix that , though . There is ? You can make ... new friends . Interested ? Um , yeah , why don 't you call us ? I 'll do that . All right , go ahead . Kill me . [ clears throat ] Harmless to the touch , but when you focus it , that 's a different story . Think you 're going to have any trouble getting her here ? None whatsoever . So what do you think ? Definitely anthropoidal . Some kind of mutant ? Maybe , but not terrestrial . What 's the chance of this being a hoax ? No hoax . [ chuckles ] - Clark . - Hi , Lana . It 's safe to come in , he 's already been decontaminated . No thanks . Are you going to be done with this in time for dinner ? Assuming you still wanna eat ? Yeah , but are you sure it 's such a good idea ? Clark , she 's got nowhere else to go , and this guy we met seems really nice . I just want her to feel like she has a home here . [ Clark ] I 'm just worried about you . [ Lana ] I 'll be fine . She 's different now , all she wants to do is fit in . [ growls ] Here 's the address and don 't be late , OK ? Am I ever ? [ growls ] I talked to him on the phone for two hours today . Two hours ? Ooh , you 're giving a lot of your time to a plumber , aren 't you ? He doesn 't always have to be a laborer . What if he wants to be ? Why would he want to do that ? Maybe he likes it . Well , how could he ? The whole idea of this country is to let people be who they wanna be . Nobody 's born any better than anyone else . We had a revolution over that . So did we . - I 'm sorry . - It 's all right . You just put it into perspective , that 's all . You have to accept people for what they are . Especially if you want them to care about you . Working kinda late , aren 't you ? I guess I just kinda lost track of time . There 's just something about this thing . The aroma perhaps ? Clark , there 's something ... [ growling ] [ grunts ] Clark ! What are you , crazy ? Um , I 'm gonna go get some help . [ air rushing ] - Hi . - Hi . Hello . [ chuckles ] Clark should be along any second . I gave him the address . - Clark ? - My friend , remember ? [ sniffing ] [ air rushing ] [ grunts ] [ growling ] Oh . They 're going to kill her . Who ? The ones from her planet . You were trying to help her ? I love her . I 'm sure Clark will be here any minute . Of course , he may not show up at all . That would be a tragedy . You know , I should just leave . I hope you guys won 't be too disappointed . I 'll show you to the door . I guess you won 't be . By the way , if Clark shows up , will you tell him to meet me at the club ? Will do . Thank you . Could you pour me some more wine , please ? Not so superior anymore , are you ? You 're one of them ? Yes . One of them . Slaves to your kind . Dirt under your feet . But I found your weakness , didn 't I ? [ inhales ] Finish it . If it makes up for what we did to you ... do it . [ growling ] [ growling ] - It saved me . - He loved you . It died for me ? The creature was dead all along , I gave it life . What are you ? This ... this is all I am . I was exploring your planet when I first saw you . I chose this body because of its strength . That is what you worship , isn 't it ? Strength ? Brutality ? I used to . But no longer . - Where are you going ? - It doesn 't matter now . No .

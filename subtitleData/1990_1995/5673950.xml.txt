Even if I was declared not guilty for what they called an accident , I had no choice but to leave . I couldn 't face my friends or Joyce . And I couldn 't face the man that adopted me and my friend Helena , taking us out of that horrible scanners institution . I had to find a way to master my powers . I went around the world and finally found a place . A monastery in Thailand . I can 't believe you talked a Polish girl into red lingerie . - I thought it was just for hookers . - Come on , Helena ! It 's the 90s . We are women , we are strong and we can do whatever the hell we want . And where exactly am I supposed to wear it ? Under your clothes . To work . Anywhere you feel like it . I mean just imagine you and your new boss , what 's his name , the takeover king . Mark Dragon . But then maybe you two could hit if off . Takeover king meets makeover queen . Sounds like a match made in heaven . Unfortunately I 'm not interested . I know it sounds crazy , it 's been almost two years , but even after all this time I 'm still hung up on Alex . ( IRON BAR CLANGS ) ( VOICES MURMUR ) Helena , are you all right ? ( VOICE ECHOES ) No . Not again . These damn migraines . See , any time I get in a crowd or any pressure situation I get paralyzed . No wonder I can 't hold a job . How am I ever supposed to ? Let 's get you home . This way . I know a shortcut back to the car . This is what always happens when I forget my pills . Aren 't you supposed to take them every day ? Yes , but they make me stupid like a sleepwalker . Almost anything is better than that . Let 's get out of here . Well , well , well , what have we got here ? Rocking babes walking down my street . Whatever it is you 're doing , it 's none of our business . We didn 't see anything so just let us go . Didn 't anyone ever tell you it was dangerous in this part of town ? You don 't want to do this . You 're just getting yourself into trouble . Thanks for the warning but you see ... We 're not the ones in trouble - you are . Run ! Run , Helena . OK . Suck on this . I think that we 'd better get out of here . HELENA : I haven 't really scanned anyone since I was 12 years old . JOYCE : It was pretty amazing . HELENA : I just didn 't know I had it in me . I knew Alex could do that kind of thing but you ... Just don 't tell Father , please . Don 't worry . Your secret 's safe with me . Thanks . ( HOOTS ) Helena . Helena ? Darling , you all right ? I have a headache , Dad . Oh . So you were with Joyce . I just saw her leaving . Hardly recognised her without her lab coat and clipboard . Here . Take one of these , try to relax . You do know I hate those pills . Look ... I don 't want to get your hopes up but ... I have something . Something which could change your life and every other scanner . That , my darling , is EPH-3 A new delivery system . Electronically charged skin patches . You wear it behind the ear and the drug is absorbed into the blood stream . One patch should last 24 hours . And you think it 'll stop the pain ? And the voices ? I certainly hope so . We 've done everything possible to purify the compound . When can I try it ? As soon as I 've finished testing . I hope it 's soon cos I can 't stand those pills any longer . They stop the pain , but everything else too . We don 't know , if any , what the side effects are . As you know , there 's no such thing as scanner lab rats . Then let me work with you on it , Dad . I understand the problem better than anyone . I live with it every day . I can be your personal control group . Helena ... We 've been through this before . Who are you going to test it on ? I 've found two terminally ill scanners who 'll volunteer . They 're at the Baumann Clinic . You 're going to work with Dr Baumann again ? That pervert . It 's the only clinic for scanners in the region . I don 't want anything to do with EPH-3 if that sadist is going to be involved . Helena , be reasonable . I 'm sorry , Dad . I just have so much work to do - a meeting tomorrow with ASN . I know . Get some rest . Come on . We can catch up in the morning . Ow ! Stop ! Ow ! Stop ! Please .

Have a good day . ( CAR DOOR CLOSES ) ( ENGINE REVS ) What 's with her ? I 'm not sure . She 's been a little ... flighty lately . I see . So why don 't you bring her into the business ? I 'm not convinced she 's ready . ( BRAKES SQUEAK ) Oh , you 're right , it 's ... It 's Alex . I just feel he should have something to come home to . I guess when you adopt children you 're always afraid that your hold on them is a little tenuous . Elton , you 've adopted them both . I mean they 're both your children . I think it 's time that you faced the fact that Alex just might not be coming back . So give her a chance . It could make things easier for both of you . I 've lost Alex , Mike .

You could be in big trouble , lady . It 's OK , really . I worked it all out ahead of time . With Doctor Baumann . Don 't worry . I 'm one of you . An alumni of the hallowed halls of Baumann Institute . And guess what . It 's graduation day . Are you a scanner ? Like us ? Not like you . Not by a long shot . Cos you know those skull-crashing headaches that make you feel like your brain 's on fire ? And that endless cacophony of voices that runs on and on and on in your head until you would gladly claw out your own eyes with your bare hands , if it will only give you one single second of blessed silence . But you know what ? I got it licked and so can you . With EPH-3 . The latest miracle of neuropharmalogical research . I had a headache this big but then I tried EPH-3 and it went away just like that , so don 't delay . Get your free samples of EPH-3 now while quantities last . And then maybe , just maybe , if you 're willing to give it your all , 100 % you will not only win your freedom but the opportunity to stand beside me , tall and proud , and say , " We 're scanners . " We do not belong on the bottom of the dung heap . We belong at the top . " And we 're going to go out there and make those self-righteous normals squirm like worms on hooks .

Because I don 't belong in the outside world . You don 't belong here either . This is not the place for you to hide from yourself nor from your past . I wanted to go back , master . I tried everything but I can 't find the answer , the way to live with myself . You have special powers . You must choose whether to treat them as a curse or a gift . I killed my best friend with my special power . Instead of denying them you could do good with your powers . There is a saying . ( SPEAKS THAI ) That means ...

( MUSIC STOPS ) ( LAUGHING ) Helena , what are you doing ? I thought I 'd throw a little party to thank you for your magnificent gift . You took EPH-3 ? It works wonderfully , Daddy . You 're a genius . Are you insane ? Take it off . It 's dangerous . But I 've never felt so marvelous . You 've got to give me more . That 's out of the question . Why don 't you come in here and we 'll discuss it ? Come out of there this instant . ( WHIRRING ) ( GASPING ) Remember when you adopted us ? Two poor little orphans that no one wanted . We were freaks . You told us you wanted a little boy to succeed you and a little girl of your very own . But you didn 't say what for . That 's why you didn 't want me to work . You wanted me all for yourself . It 's the drug . Take it off . All that pain and all this time you 've had the answer . Take it off . Nothing personal , Daddy , but with you around , I 'd never get control of your company . ( SHE LAUGHS ) ( POLICE RADIO ) ( CAMERA CLICKS ) Oh , Michael ! I got here as fast as I could . What happened ? They say it was a heart attack , Michael , but I just saw him floating out there and I tried to help him but ... I was too late . What was he doing in the hot tub at this hour ? He hated that hot tub . Michael , he 's dead . My dad 's dead . Of course I 'll make all the arrangements . At least his will is in order . As you know , I 'm the executor so I can go over it with you in detail . In a few days - there 's no rush , don 't worry . And of course I 'll have to contact Alex . He 's going to have to make several decisions about the company . I don 't think you can . You know , Father tried to find him for a year . Yes . Perhaps that 's why Alex didn 't want to be found . Not by his father , at least . Michael , you ... Don 't get your hopes up . We 'll see . I 've got to make some calls . And don 't worry , please . I 'm taking care of everything . Alex , hmm ... My dear beloved brother . ( THAI FLIGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ) Your passport is due to expire in less than a week . I know . I 'm only going to be here a couple of days . Sorry , you cannot enter Thailand without a passport valid for at least six months after the date of your arrival . Of course , we will make an exception in your case . Enjoy your stay , sir . ( SPEAKS THAI ) Thank you . Welcome to Thailand . Yeah , right . The master says ... we must accept death as karma . But there 's a long way between theory and practice . I cannot accept Father 's death , Michael . ( SPEAKS THAI ) It 's been hard on all of us . Come back with me . It 's been over a year . No one blames you for what happened . ( THEY SPEAK THAI ) He never understood . Even if I hadn 't ... ( SPEAKS THAI ) Even if things hadn 't turned out the way they did , Mike , I still wouldn 't have gone back to the company . Well , he was obsessed with having an heir to the family business , you know that . I wish it had been Helena . It just might be if you don 't come back . Alex , don 't get me wrong , but I feel there 's something pretty strange about your father 's death . Alex , I didn 't come here just to tell you about your father . It 's Helena . Something 's happened to her . ( WHIRRING ) Yes , I 'm certain . I saw the patch on her neck . Why would she do that , Mike ? She was never the impulsive type . She 's changed , Alex . Not for the better . What do you mean ? I can 't put my finger on it but ... it was as if she resented the way your father treated her . Hey , Alex ! It 's a long way from Baumann 's Clinic , huh ? ( HOOTING ) HELENA : My brother , Alex , is dead . As you can imagine , this second blow has affected me deeply . However , because both my father and my brother are now gone , I have , through these tragic accidents , been left in the position of being my father 's sole heir . And after a great deal of soul searching , I have decided to succeed him . As chairman and CEO of Monet Pharmaceutical . Well , we all share your grief , Miss Monet , and I believe that I can safely say that we appreciate your desire to continue your father 's work . However , a decision of this nature must be brought to a vote . I presume you have a candidate in mind . Yes , I would like to nominate ... ( WHIRRING ) Er ... Er ... er ... Miss Helena Monet . My father was a brilliant scientist . He was a great humanitarian . But as many of you no doubt realise , he was not an aggressive businessman . He was content to simply maintain corporate stature of Monet Pharmaceutical . However ... I am not . So here is the game plan . First , annihilation of MPl 's competitors in the pharmaceutical field Second , strategic diversification and expansion into new areas . Third , total domination of all new markets and territories . Things have changed around here , guys . And it 's going to be a bumpy ride , so if you want to bail out , bail out now . MASTER : Alex . MASTER 'S VOICE : I know you are traumatized . But there is evil in this world that not even a stoic can ignore . And we must face the conflict between such evil and its opposite , good . We must have criteria for deciding what , in any situation , is good , what is evil . You will find the fulcrum in your heart . Now go deep inside yourself . Use the long breath method . ( HEART BEATING ) Now that you can control your breath you learn to control your heart . ( HEART BEAT SLOWS DOW N ) - Hi . - Hi . - How are you ? - Fine . Listen , Joyce ... I have a question . Before Father 's heart attack he was working on a new formula , EPH-3 . You know about it ? - Mm-hmm , a little . - Good . - Because I want to go into production . - Helena , that 's impossible . Your father was making progress but it was still experimental . It 's OK , Joyce . I tried it myself . Helena , how could you do that ? Do you know what could have happened to you , taking an untested drug ? I know , I know , but it works , Joyce . It works beautifully . No negative side effects , just a complete release from pain . The problem is Dad only left a small supply and I need more to keep going . Especially if I 'm going to run this company . I can 't do that . I don 't have the formula . Here . You have to do top to bottom analysis and I want you to put it into full scale production immediately . This is what Dad wanted . It was his dream to make scanners ' lives bearable , to cure their pain . We cannot let it be destroyed . It 's going to take some time . I 'm so glad I have at least one friend here . Thank you , Joyce . ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) You wanted to see me , Miss Monet ? Yes . George , isn 't it ? Yes , Miss Monet . Have a seat . I liked your presentation to the board . Thank you , Miss Monet . I want you to be my personal assistant . Any problems with that , George ? - No , I 'd be ... - Good . Because I want all the company 's financial records , the latest earnings report , a list of all our assets , particularly liquid assets . I want it complete and I want it in an hour . Got that ? Yes , Miss Monet . One more thing . - Do you have a girlfriend ? - Yes . Ditch her . You are going ... to be a very ... - busy boy . - ( CLAPPING ) You must be just so very excited . You 've got a new rock video , A new hairdo , I see , and if my research staff haven 't screwed up again , a new man in your life . - Whoa , a new man in my life . - Come on , Georgie boy , use your imagination . The video 's coming out next week and so far the response ... Oh yes , that 's much better . Oh yes , that 's much better . You make me tingle all over . I didn 't say that , did I ? We 'd better watch it - we 're on live television . I need you so bad . I need you now . ( AUDIENCE LAUGHING ) Let 's make it with a naked nasty . Oh yeah ... Let 's make it with a naked nasty . ( CLAPPING ) Please stand by . We are experiencing technical difficulties . I hope you 're not experiencing any technical difficulties , George . No , no , no . Just watch the TV , OK ? ( SCREAMS ) It works . I 've got a feeling we 'll be going network on this . You see what 's happening to the ASN stock ? Yeah ? Well , you 're supposed to be in charge of it . Well how the hell did it happen ? Well , tell them to stop selling , jerk off . I am the goddamn takeover king . Nobody does this to me . Find out who the hell 's behind it and find out now . Jesus ! Helena , who the hell let you in here ? Is that the way to greet your favourite girl Friday ? What did you do ? Slip a Mickey in my drink ? I actually slipped a Mickey into your life . By the way , how am I doing ? You ? You ? You 're behind this ? Well , let me tell you something . You don 't have a hope in hell , cos I personally am going to rip off your balls - and shove ' em down your throat . - Ooh ! I don 't have any balls , Mark . Goddamn right . But by the look of things , I do have ASN . What was it again ? 15 stations in 54 countries or the other way around ? Over my dead body . I knew you had a knack for business , Mark , but wow ! That 's brilliant ! What are you talking about ? What do you mean ? I mean how about a nice cool dip in the old pool ? What are you , nuts ? It 's free ... Now that you mention it ... ( WHIRRING ) Um ... Not such a bad idea . Mark , Mark , Mark , this exhibitionist thing , I start to worry about you . Mmm ... Excellent form , Mark . I must say , you do have balls . Now , hang on to them . Now that I think of it , - it was 54 stations , 15 countries . - ( LAUGHING ) Exactly what I need for my next takeover . Helena ? Can I help you ? Yes , I 'm here to see Helena Monet . I 'm her brother , Alex . Just a moment . Miss Monet 's brother is here to see her . - They 'll just be a moment . - Thank you . Alex ! You haven 't changed . You heard . Yeah , I 've heard . Michael told me . Michael ? When did you talk to him ? He 's dead . Oh my God ! Not Michael . What happened ? I 've been over in Thailand , Helena . Michael came to tell me about Dad . He was attacked for no reason . There was a scanner there who I think was responsible . Scanner ? Something must have set him off . It wasn 't like that . It was deliberate , calculated , cold-blooded murder . Why would anyone want to kill Michael ? I was hoping you 'd be able to tell me . I 've been living in a monastery for two years . Suddenly Dad 's dead , Michael 's dead and and you 've taken over here . What 's with the ... - scan signal on video , Helena ? - That ! I was just playing around , Alex . You were burning cigars ? Michael said he was concerned about you , said you were taking a new drug . - ( INTERCOM BUZZES ) - Miss Monet , your car is waiting for your 10.30 at ASN . Thank you , George . I 'm on my way . I 'm sorry . I have a meeting with our Japanese affiliates . Look , there is a drug , it 's true . EPH-S . Dad invented it . It 's for scanners , completely relieving their pain but I don 't know what Michael was talking about - it 's a miracle drug . Ask Joyce if you don 't believe me . Joyce is involved ? Yes , she 's up at Baumann . They 're doing wonderful things for scanners . The place has changed so much . Go and see for yourself . I think Joyce would love to see you . ( PHONE RINGS ) Dr Baumann is unavailable . May I take a message ? Ah yes , thank you . I can help you . Hi . I 'm looking for Joyce Stone . Tell her it 's Alex Monet . Of course , sir If you just follow me . I think you 'll find what you 're looking for right in here . ( GIGGLING ) Um ... - Miss ... - Susie . Susie . Susie , look ... I don 't think this is a good idea . See , I ... I live in a monastery . Well , this 'll give you something to think about when you lay in bed alone in the dark ... doing whatever it is you do . Where 's Dr Stone ? She 's been detained but I 'm here to take care of your every need . - Can you keep a secret ? - Yeah . They 're not real . ( SHE GIGGLES ) Well , well , well , well , well , well . What do we have here ? Boys , I think we 've got us a rapist . Oh , come on , Mitch , he was willing . Not you , nimbo-bimbo . Him . - Me ? - Mm . What 's going on around here ? - And what ? - Well , let me explain . This is the breakdown of the analysis of the EPH-3 prototype . Peroxide hydrochloride , cyanocobalamin , cupric oxide . - I know that . And so ? - So nothing . It 's inert . You might as well be taking vitamin pills , Helena . You must have missed something . Well , we 're running it through again but I don 't think so . If there is anything I can do to help . I know . I 'll look through Dad 's videotape . See if I can find something there . - Wake up , pal . - Guard the door . Taking a little stroll down memory lane . Oh come on ! Come on ! Nothing like a taste of Baumann 's laser therapy to teach a guy to keep his hands off the staff , huh , Mitch ? Wake up , Romeo . We want to show you our new toy . Agh ! ( BUZZING ) ( WHIRRING ) ( WHIRRING ) Quick ! Get around the back door . Get in the bus . Come on ! Come on ! The creep 's getting away . Faster ! Faster ! ( HOOTING ) I think I got him . Can you swim ? Better safe than sorry . Go check . ( BEEP AND DIAL TONE ) ( SHE GASPS ) Alex ? Jesus ! What 's happened to you ? I 'm ... not sure you 're going to believe it . I 'm still not sure I do . What is it ? 'Can I had to kill a man today . I just got back this morning . I wanted to see you so I went out to Baumann . Baumann ? Why ? Cos Helena told me that you would be there . But it was a trap . She sent me out there deliberately . A group of scanners attacked me . That 's impossible . She 's your sister . She 's my best friend . She 's changed . Joyce ... can you tell me anything about this new drug she 's taking ? EPH-3 . Your dad developed it . Are you sure there 's no side effects of that drug ? I never saw the test results . Helena said it herself . I just believed her when she told me there were no side effects . Maybe there are . The way she 's been acting . I think it 's somehow blocked out her conscience . Especially with scanners , Joyce . That can be a very dangerous thing . It 's hard to explain . But when a ... When a scanner loses control there are these forces , strange feelings inside that ... It 's almost like a rage . It just builds and builds and builds and builds inside you . Is there , Alex ? Is that what you were afraid of ? Is that why you ran away ? Exterior application is necessitated . Now , I have with me a rough prototype skin patch , which ... Oh shit ! Pardon me for using such highly technical language . Which ... Oh shit ! Pardon me for using such highly technical language . Ah ! This is continuation of lab report October 17th 1990 . - ( VOICES WHISPER ) - Daddy , what have I done ? - In order to isolate ... - ( VOICES GETTING LOUDER ) ( VOICES CONTINUE ) ( VOICES FADE ) Most important , E.P.H.3 , or as we call it , EPH-3 , remains inactive until the electronic sensor is triggered by trace molecular elements found only in scanner subjects . Bingo ! Now I 'm going to turn this off . - Alex . - Mm-hm . I 've been thinking about what you said about Helena . Is that what you 've been thinking about ? Seriously . I think I 'm going to go down to the office and see what I can find out . Mm . Are you listening to me ? No . No , I didn 't think so . ( WHIRRING ) ( PHONE RINGS ) Hi there ! ( WHIRRING ) Go ! He 's going around the other side . ( WHIRRING ) I hate this bloody city . I really hate this city . Interesting reading ? It 's nice to see my employees in bright and early snooping through my office . Speaking of eager beavers , I hear you and Alex had a very tender reunion . Helena , what have you done ? You 're such an innocent , such a prude . I 'll tell you what I 've done . I 've come into my own . I 've finally gotten the power I 've always deserved . By the way , while you were making whoopie I was making history . Yep . I cracked the code , Joyce . Seems like poor old Dad just forgot to mention that the missing element is only to be found in bodily secretions of the scanners ' metabolic type . Helena , please listen to me . You 've got to stop taking the drug . Psychological side effects could be devastating . - You think so ? - Yes . This isn 't you , Helena . You 're not normal . You can say that again .

I 'm ... temporary . Not too temporary , I hope . Say , after I 've finished with my rounds ... I can 't wait . Neither can I. MASTER : Now that you can control your breath ... ( GIGGLES ) - ... you learn to control your heart . - ( HEART BEATS ) ( CONTINUOUS TONE ) Jesus ! We 've got a code blue ! Move it ! Well , don 't just stand there . Prep him . Nothing . OK , let 's try and jump star ' : the poor bastard . - Clear . - Clear . - Nothing . - Clear . Clear . Oh , there 's nothing , doctor . Mark the time and take him down for an autopsy . ( I MOZART : Don Giovanni ) Mind if I use your phone ? Is it a ... Is it a ... a ... a local call ? I 've got total control over Worldwide Satellite Network and EPH-3 in full production . Now let 's go on the air and take over the world . Scanners are in control , thanks to you , Joyce . My job was simple . By the way , how are you feeling ? I have never felt better in my life , Helena . That 's good because it 's show time . ( PHONE RINGS ) Come on , Joyce , answer the phone . He 's fading back long and there 's the pass . Oh , look at that ! He 's cut down on the 45-yard line . Joyce Stone , I need to see her . Now . I don 't know where she is . - Where did she take her ? - I don 't know . Enjoy the game , Ms Monet .

ASN is bringing all the excitement and action of pro football to an additional 25 countries . And now back to you , Jim . Right , Miss Monet . It 's two and ten on the 45 . And there 's the snap back . Oh ! ... And Jim , I think I can guarantee that our estimated 75 million viewers have a big thrill in store for them , right ? Right , Miss Monet . Now , let 's get back to the playing field . It 's third down and ten to go and there 's the snap , he 's fading back for the pass . Oh ! He 's going for it . Up to the 35 , the 30 , could be going all the way . Like I said , Jim , a violent game . - Hey , man , what 's going on ? - I don 't know . ( HOOTING ) There goes a doctor onto the field . ( CROWD SHOUTING ) But first let 's take another look with ASN 's isocam . Wow , talk about special effects ! You will obey without hesitation my every command .

Nothing can stop us now . Resistance is impossible . It is a new world order and we are in control . Come on , Joyce , gonna get you out . That wouldn 't be a very good idea , Alex . Wouldn 't want you to ruin everything we 've been working so hard for . Agh ! Get him ! Look , Joyce , I gotta go back .

I 'll give you the second act . Helena ! You meddlesome little twerp . Sweet , sweet revenge . A dish best savored cold . But some like it hot . It 's gonna get a hell of a lot hotter before I 'm through . Give it a rest , Helena . You always wanted to hog my glory , didn 't you ? I never wanted your glory , Helena . I never did . Liar !

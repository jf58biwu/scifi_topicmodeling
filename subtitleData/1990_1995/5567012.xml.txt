 ( Please select 2nd audio track to enjoy AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1 ) [ Sarah ] Three billion human lives ended on August 29 , 1997 . The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war " Judgment Day . " They lived only to face a new nightmare , the war against the machines . The computer which controlled the machines , Skynet sent two Terminators back through time . Their mission : to destroy the leader of the human resistance . John Connor , my son . The first Terminator was programmed to strike at me in the year 1984 before John was born . It failed . The second was set to strike at John himself when he was still a child . As before , the resistance was able to send a lone warrior a protector for John . It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first . I need your clothes , your boots and your motorcycle . You forgot to say please . Get him off me ! Pull it out ! Pull it out ! Oh ! Oh , no ! Take it . Can 't let you take the man 's wheels , son . Now , get off before I put you down . That 's it , God damn it . R-31 David , show me Code 6 at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe on electrical disturbance . Ten-four , R-31 David . John . John , get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours . John ! Your foster parents are kind of dicks , huh ? I swear , I have had it with that goddamn kid . - He won 't even answer me anymore . - Honey , move . Would you get off your butt and help me ? - Todd ! - What ? What ? He hasn 't cleaned that room of his in a month . Wow , it 's an emergency . Hang on . I 'll get right on it . Come on . John ! Come on . Get your ass inside . Do what your mother tells you . She 's not my mother , Todd . This next patient is interesting . I 've been following the case for years . A 29-year-old female diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder . The usual indicators : depression , anxiety , violent acting out delusions of persecution . The delusional architecture is fairly unique . She believes that a machine called the Terminator which looks human of course , was sent back through time - to kill her . - That 's original . And also that the father of her child - was a soldier sent back to protect her . - No . He was from the future too . The year 2029 , if I remember correctly . And here we are . Morning , Sarah . Good morning , Dr. Silberman . How 's the knee ? Fine , Sarah . She stabbed me in the kneecap with my pen a few weeks ago . Repeated escape attempts . Let 's move on , shall we ? Douglas , I don 't like to see the patients disrupting their rooms like this . - See that she takes her Thorazine . - Sure , Dr. Silberman . I 'll take care of it . Are you the legal guardian of John Connor ? That 's right , Officer . What 's he done now ? - Could I speak with him , please ? - You could if he were here . He took off on his bike this morning . So he could be anywhere . - Do you have a photograph of John ? - Yeah . Sure . Hold on . You gonna tell me what this is about ? I just need to ask him a few questions . He 's a good-looking boy . - Do you mind if I keep this picture ? - No , go on . There was a guy here this morning looking for him too . Yeah , a big guy on a bike . Has that got something to do with this ? No . I wouldn 't worry about him . Thanks for your cooperation . Please insert your stolen card now . PIN number . Will you hurry up ? This is taking too long . Go , baby . Go , baby . Go , baby . All right . - PIN number 9003 . - Where 'd you learn this stuff from , anyway ? From my mom . My real mom , I mean . Withdraw $ 300 . Come on , baby . Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! - Yes ! - Hey , it worked . All right . Easy money . Come on ! Yes ! Piece of cake . - Is that her ? - Yes . She 's pretty cool , huh ? No , she 's a complete psycho . That 's why she 's up at Pescadero . It 's a mental institute . Okay ? She tried to blow up the computer factory but she got shot and arrested . No shit . She 's a total loser . Come on . Let 's go spend some money . It 's like a giant strobe light burning right through my eyes . Somehow I can still see . Oh , God . We know the dream 's the same every night . - Why do I have to ... - Please continue . Children look like burned paper . Black . Not moving . And then the blast wave hits them . And they fly apart like leaves . Dreams of cataclysm , the end of the world are very common . It 's not a dream , you moron . It 's real . - I know the date it happens . - I 'm sure it feels very real to you . On August 29 , 1997 . It 's gonna feel pretty fucking real to you too ! Anybody not wearing two-million sun block is gonna have a real bad day . - Get it ? - Sarah . God , you think you 're safe and alive . You 're already dead . Everybody ! Him . You . You 're dead already . This whole place , everything you see is gone ! You 're the one living in the fucking dream , Silberman , ' cause I know it happens ! It happens ! I feel much better now . Clearer . Yes , your attitude has been much improved lately . It 's helped me to have a goal , something to look forward to . What is that ? Well , you said that if I showed improvement after six months you would transfer me to the minimum security wing and I could have visitors . Well , it 's been six months and I was looking forward to seeing my son . I see . Let 's go back to what you were saying about those Terminator machines . Now you think they don 't exist ? They don 't exist . I know that now . But you 've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press . If I had , there would have been some evidence . They would have found something at the factory . I see . So you don 't believe anymore that the company covered it up ? No . Why would they ? Let 's try a new position right there . Mr. Dyson . Mr. Dyson . The materials team is running another ... - Mr. Dyson . - Yes ? The materials team is running another series this afternoon . You have to sign for the ... For the ... it . - You have to sign it out . - Okay . Come on . I 'll get it . Listen , Mr. Dyson , I know I haven 't been here that long , but I was wondering if you could tell me ... I mean , if you know ... Know what ? Well , if you know where " it " came from . I asked them that very same question once . You know what they told me ? " Don 't ask . " - Good morning , Mr. Dyson . - How 's it going ? Okay . Insert key . Left on three . Two , one , turn . Right . - How are the wife and kids ? - Great . Thanks . There you go . So what do you think , Doctor ? I have shown improvement , haven 't I ? Well , Sarah , here 's the problem . I know how smart you are . And I think you 're just telling me what I wanna hear . I don 't think you really believe what you 're telling me today . I think if I put you in minimum security , you 'll just try to escape again . You have to let me see my son . Please . Please . He 's in great danger . He 's naked without me . If I could make a phone call ... I 'm afraid not . Not for a while . I don 't see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here for another six months . I 'll kill you , you son of a bitch ! Douglas ! - You son of a bitch ! - Get her off . Ten CCs of sodium amytal , stat ! - You don 't know what you 're doing ! - Get some restraints in here now ! You don 't know what you 're doing ! Got her ? Model citizen . You just missed him . He was here , like 15 minutes ago . - Think he said he was going to the galleria . - Yeah . The galleria ? - I never saw him . - There , at the arcade . I 'm gonna get some quarters . I 'll be back , all right ? Cool . Oh , no ! - Girls , do you know John Connor ? - No . Hey , do you know this guy ? No , I don 't know him . - John . - Not now . Not now . Hey , man , there 's this cop scoping for you . Check it out . Yeah , he 's right over there . Split , man . Just go . Yeah . Hey , man , I think I saw that kid you were looking ... Hey ! You 're not supposed to be in here ! Hey ! Hey ! Get down . Mister , are you all right ? You all right ? Come on ! Come on ! Shit ! Goddamn ! Okay , timeout . Stop the bike . Timeout . Come on , stop the bike . Holy shit . Now , don 't take this the wrong way . - But you are a Terminator , right ? - Yes . Cyberdyne Systems , Model 101 . No . Holy shit . You 're really real . I mean ... You 're like a machine underneath , right ? But sort of alive outside ? I 'm a cybernetic organism . Living tissue over metal endoskeleton . This is intense . Get a grip , John . Okay . You 're not here to kill me . I figured that part out for myself . - So what 's the deal ? - My mission is to protect you . Yeah ? - Who sent you ? - You did . Thirty-five years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here in this time . Oh , this is deep . So this other guy , he 's a Terminator like you , right ? Not like me . A T-1000 , advanced prototype . - You mean , more advanced than you are ? - Yes . A mimetic poly-alloy . - What the hell does that mean ? - Liquid metal . Where are we going ? We have to get out of the city immediately and avoid the authorities . Listen , I gotta stop by my house . I wanna pick up some stuff . Negative . The T-1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there . - You sure ? - I would . Look , Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them . Shit . You got a quarter ? - Hello . - Janelle , it 's me . John ? - Yeah . Is everything all right ? - Are you guys okay ' ? - Sure , honey , everything 's okay . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . John , it 's late . Honey , I was beginning to worry about you . If you hurry home , we can sit down and have dinner together . I 'm making beef stew . Something 's wrong . She 's never this nice . John . Where are you ? What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at ? Hey , shut up , you worthless piece of shit ! The dog 's really barking . Thought you were gonna tell the kid to get rid of that fucking mutt . John , honey , it 's late . Please don 't make me worry . Could he already be there ? Honey , are you okay ? [ In John 's Voice ] I 'm right here . I 'm fine . Are you sure ? Are you sure you 're all right ? - What 's the dog 's name ? - Max . [ In John 's Voice ] Hey , Janelle . What 's wrong with Wolfie ? [ In John 's Voice ] I can hear him barking . Is he okay ? Wolfie 's fine , honey . Wolfie 's just fine . Where are you ? Your foster parents are dead . I need a minute here . You 're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches ? Anything it samples by physical contact . Get real . Like it could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes ? No , only an object of equal size . Why not just become a bomb or something to get me ? It can 't form complex machines . Guns and explosives have chemicals , moving parts . It doesn 't work that way . But it can form solid metal shapes . - Like what ? - Knives and stabbing weapons . These were taken by a video surveillance camera at the West Highland police station in 1984 . He killed 17 police officers that night . Men with families , children . These were taken at a mall in Reseda today . Miss Connor , we know you know who this guy is . Look , I just sat here and told you that your son is missing , that the foster parents have been murdered . We know this guy 's involved . Doesn 't that mean anything to you ? Don 't you care ? We 're wasting our time . Let 's go . Sorry , guys - She 's just grown more and more disconnected from reality as time goes on . I 'm afraid she can 't help us now . If she clears at all and can give us anything , I 'll call you . Sure . Douglas , take her back to her room . Yes , sir . Come on , sweetheart . Let 's go . We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that . For a while there , she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy , running guns . Then there were some other guys . She 'd shack up with anybody she could learn from so she could teach me how to be this great military leader . Then she gets busted . It 's like , " Sorry , kid , your mom 's a psycho . Didn 't you know ? " It 's like everything I 've been brought up to believe is all made-up bullshit . I hated her for that . But everything she said was true . She knew and nobody believed her , not even me . - Listen . We gotta get her out of there . - Negative . The T-1000 's highest probability for success now will be to copy Sarah Connor and to wait for you to make contact with her . Great . What happens to her ? Typically , the subject being copied is terminated . Shit ! Why didn 't you tell me ? We gotta go right now ! Negative . It 's not a mission priority . Fuck you ! She 's a priority to me ! God damn it ! What 's your problem ? God damn it ! Help ! - This does not help our mission . - Help ! Get this psycho off of me ! Help ! Help ! Help ! I 'm being kidnapped ! Get this psycho off of me ! Let me go ! - Why the hell did you do that ? - Because you told me to . What ? You have to do what I say , huh ? That 's one of my mission parameters . Prove it . Stand on one foot . Yes ! Cool . My own Terminator . Wow . You okay , kid ? Take a hike , bozo . - Let 's get out of here , man . - What ? Fuck you , you little dipshit ! Dipshit ? Put your leg down . Did you call moi a dipshit ? Just trying to help this punk . Grab this guy . I can 't believe he called me a dipshit . Get him off of me ! Now who 's the dipshit you jock douche bag ? Get him off me ! No ! Holy shit ! Put the gun down now ! - Get out of here ! - Come on , cuz . Let 's split ! Come on ! Jesus ! You were gonna kill that guy ! Of course . I 'm a Terminator . Listen to me very carefully , okay ? You 're not a Terminator anymore , all right ? You got that ? You just can 't go around killing people . Why ? What do you mean , why ? ' Cause you can 't . Why ? Because you just can 't . Okay ? Trust me on this . Look . I 'm gonna go get my mom . I order you to help me . Hi . You have a Sarah Connor here ? You 're running kind of late , aren 't you ? They 've been in there for an hour . Hold on a second . I 'll buzz you in . Oh , here comes your friends now . That was productive . - Gwen , you want some coffee ? - No , thanks . - How about a beer ? - Yeah , right . - Hey , I got a full house . - That 's good , Lewis . Must be my lucky day . Yeah , I think you 're right about number 24 . Increase the medication to 250 milligrams . Same kind ? You ! You broke my arm . There are 215 bones in the human body . That 's one . Now , don 't move . What are you going to do ? Why do we stop now ? Now , you gotta promise me you 're not gonna kill anyone , right ? - Right . - Swear ? What ? Just put up your hand and say , " I swear I won 't kill anyone . " I swear I will not kill anyone . All right . Let 's go . Visiting hours is 10 : 00 to 4 : 00 . Monday through Friday . What the hell are you doing ? You son of a bitch ! You shot me ! Crazy bastard ! Don 't shoot me again . Don 't kill me . He 'll live . Son of a bitch ! Let 's all try to remain calm . Open it , or he 'll be dead before he hits the floor . There 's no way , Connor . Let him go . - Open the door . - It ain 't gonna happen . Take it easy , Sarah . Easy . It won 't work , Sarah . You 're no killer . I don 't believe you can do it . You 're already dead , Silberman . Everybody dies . You know I believe it . So don 't fuck with me ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Open it ! Back off ! Get back ! I 'll pump him full of this shit . I swear ! Back up ! Back up ! Don 't move ! Drop the shit ! Do it ! Just do it ! Get in the office . On the floor , face down . Not you ! Open the door . On the floor . Hold it open . Face the wall ! You bitch ! Get her ! Get her ! Hurry up ! Open the door ! The door 's locked ! Let 's go ! Come on . Open it ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! - Shit . She broke it off . - Open it ! Let 's go around ! Come on ! Move it ! Come on ! No ! No ! No ! Mom , wait ! Mom ! Come back here ! No ! No ! No ! - Help her ! - Wait here . - Hurry up ! Hurry up ! - He 'll kill us all ! - He 'll kill us all ! - Hold her . He 'll kill us all ! Mom , are you okay ? Mom ! Come with me if you want to live . It 's okay , Mom . He 's here to help . It 's okay . Go . What the fuck is it ? What the fuck is going on ? Get down . Mom ! Out of the car ! Right now ! Go ! I 'm out . - Come on . - Here . Reload . Last one ! Hang on . Ready ! John ! Here , drive . He 's not back there . There 's nobody behind us . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Can you even see anything ? I see everything . Cool . Come here . I said I was okay . John , it was stupid of you to go there . God damn it . You have to be smarter than that . You almost got yourself killed . What were you thinking ? You cannot risk yourself , even for me . Do you understand ? You 're too important . Do you understand ? But , I had to get you out of that place . I 'm sorry . I didn 't need your help . I can take care of myself . What 's wrong with your eyes ? Nothing . So , what 's your story ? - You okay ? - Fine . Say , that 's a nice bike . Hey ! Watch it , lug nuts . Listen , do you know what you 're doing ? I have detailed files on human anatomy . I bet . - Makes you a more efficient killer , right ? - Correct . Does it hurt when you get shot ? I sense injuries . The data could be called " pain . " John , help me with the light . - Will these heal up ? - Yes . Good . If you can 't pass for human , you 're not much good to us . How long do you live ? I mean , last . Whatever . A hundred and twenty years with my existing power cell . Can you learn stuff that you haven 't been programmed with so you can be you know , more human and not such a dork all the time ? My CPU is a neural net processor , a learning computer . The more contact I have with humans , the more I learn . Cool . Are we learning yet ? Hey . We have to get as far away from the city as possible . Just head south . Keep it under 65 . - We don 't want to be pulled over . - Affirmative . No , no , no , no . You gotta listen to the way people talk . You don 't say " affirmative " or some shit like that . You say , " No problemo . " And , if someone comes up to you with an attitude , you say , " Eat me . " And if you want to shine them on , it 's " Hasta la vista , baby . " Hasta la vista , baby . Yeah , or , " Later , dick-wad . " If someone gets upset , you say , " Chill out . " Or you can do combinations . Chill out , dick-wad . That 's great . See ? You 're getting it . No problemo . Want some of my fries ? - Need any help ? - No . - I got you ! - No , you didn 't ! - I got you ! - No , you didn 't ! I did . I got you . I came around here and I got you . - No , you didn 't ! I told you , I 'm bulletproof . - I did . We 're not gonna make it , are we ? People , I mean . It 's in your nature to destroy yourselves . Yeah . Major drag , huh ? Break it up before I wring both of your necks . Come on . I need to know how Skynet gets built . Who 's responsible ? The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson . Who is that ? He 's the director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation . Why him ? In a few months , he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor . Go on . Then what ? In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems . All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers , becoming fully unmanned . Afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record . The Skynet Funding Bill is passed . The system goes on-line on August 4 , 1997 . Human decisions are removed from strategic defense . Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate . It becomes self-aware at 2 : 14 a.m. Eastern time , August 29 . In a panic , they try to pull the plug . - Skynet fights back . - Yes . It launches its missiles against the targets in Russia . Why attack Russia ? Aren 't they our friends now ? Because Skynet knows that the Russian counterattack will eliminate its enemies over here . Jesus . How much do you know about Dyson ? I have detailed files . I want to know everything . What he looks like , where he lives , everything . Wait in the car . Enrique ! You here ? You 're pretty jumpy , Connor . What about you ? Always on the lurk . - Good to see you , Connor . - I promised to make it back . Man , I knew it . Good to see you . Yolanda . Get out here , we got company . And bring some tequila ! Hey , big John . What 's up ? Who 's your friend ? He 's cool , Enrique . He 's with me . He 's ... Uncle Bob . Uncle Bob , this is Enrique . Uncle Bob , huh ? Okay . How are you ? How are you ? You 've gotten big . Drink ? Uncle Bob ? You 're pretty famous , you know , all over the goddamn TV . Pictures of you , John , your big friend here . Cops are going nuts looking for you . Take the kid , honey , will you ? I just came for my stuff . I need clothes , food and one of your trucks . Hey , how about the fillings out of my fucking teeth ? Now , Enrique . You two , you 're on weapons detail . Come on , let 's go . One thing about my mom ... she always plans ahead . Excellent . Nothing down here . Well , this is the best truck I got , but the starter motor 's gone . You got time to change it out ? Yeah . I 'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border . Okay . See , I grew up in places like this , so I just thought that 's how people lived , riding around in helicopters , learning how to blow shit up . That 's definitely you . Most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks , but there was this one guy , he was kind of cool . He taught me engines . Hold here . Mom screwed it up , of course . She 'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader . That 'd be all she wrote . Torque wrench , please . Here . I wish I could 've met my real dad . You Will . Yeah , I guess . When I 'm , like , 45 , I think . I sent him back through time to 1984 . Man . He hasn 't even been born yet . It messes with your head . - The other bolt . - Oh . Here . Mom and him were only together for one night . She still loves him , I guess . I see her crying sometimes . She denies it totally , of course , like she got something stuck in her eye . Why do you cry ? - You mean people ? - Yeah . I don 't know . We just cry , you know , when it hurts . Pain causes it ? No . It 's different . It 's when there 's nothing wrong with you , but you hurt anyway . - You get it ? - No . - All right , my man ! - No problemo . Give me five . Just put out your hand like this , come on . All right ! Now hit me . Give me five . Do the same thing . Do the same thing . All right ! Okay , that 's good , that 's good . Up high . Up high . Five low . Too slow . I 'm just kidding . Let 's try it one more time . Good . Now try it . Now try it . Good . Now do me . Give me five . Watching John with the machine , it was suddenly so clear . The Terminator would never stop . It would never leave him and it would never hurt him , never shout at him , or get drunk and hit him , or say it was too busy to spend time with him . It would always be there , and it would die to protect him . Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years , this thing , this machine , was the only one who measured up . In an insane world it was the sanest choice . Hey , let 's try this one . There we go . She said you go south with him like you planned . - She 'll meet you tomorrow . The other side . - Mom ! Mom ! Mom , wait ! " No fate . " No fate but what we make . My father told her this . I mean , I made him memorize it up in the future as a message to her . Never mind . Now , okay , the whole thing goes : The future 's not set . There 's no fate but what we make for ourselves . She intends to change the future . Yeah , I guess . Oh , shit ! - Dyson . - Yeah . Gotta be . Miles Dyson . She 's gonna blow him away . Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on ! This is tactically dangerous . Drive faster . The T-1000 has the same files that I do . It knows what I know . It might anticipate this move . I don 't care . We gotta stop her . Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war . I don 't care ! Haven 't you learned anything yet ? Haven 't you figured out why you can 't kill people ? Danny , I told you to go to bed , now . I 'm not kidding . Just a couple of minutes , Mom ! Danny , your time is up ! Come brush your teeth and get to bed . Daddy ! Danny , just go ! Go ! Danny , go ! - Mom ! - Miles ! Miles ! - Run , Tarissa , run ! - Oh , my God ! Tarissa , just take Danny and go . Just run ! Run ! Oh , Jesus ! Miles ! - Daddy ! - Danny ! Danny ! Nobody fucking move ! Don 't hurt my daddy ! Get down on the floor , bitch . Fuck ! Get down now ! Oh , God . - Get out of the way ! - Don 't hurt him ! Get on the floor , fucking right now ! Just let the boy go . Shut up . Shut up . Shut up ! Shut up ! It 's all your fault , motherfucker . - It 's all your fault ! - What ? I 'm not gonna let you do it . Shit ! We 're too late ! Check them . Look at me , Mom . Are you hurt ? Look at me . I almost ... I almost ... It 'll be okay , Ma . It 'll be okay . We 'll figure something out . Okay ? I promise . You came here to stop me . Yeah , I did . I love you , John . I always have . I know . Clean penetration . No shattered bone . Here hold , here . The pressure should stop the bleeding . Who are you people ? Show him . Danny , I want you to come with me right now , okay . Show me your room . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Now listen to me very carefully . [ Sarah ] Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down . Skynet . Judgment Day . The history of things to come . It 's not every day that you find out you 're responsible for three billion deaths . He took it pretty well . I feel like I 'm gonna throw up . You 're judging me on things I haven 't even done yet . How were we supposed to know ? Yeah . Right . How were you supposed to know ? Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb . Men like you thought it up . You think you 're so creative . You don 't know what it 's like to really create something , to create a life , to feel it growing inside you . All you know how to create is death and destruction . Mom . Mom ! We need to be a little more constructive here . Okay ? We still have to stop this from happening , don 't we ? But I thought ... Aren 't we changing things , I mean , right now , changing the way it goes ? That 's right . There 's no way I 'm going to finish the new processor . Not now . Forget it . Now , I 'm out of it . I 'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow . That 's not good enough . - No one must follow your work . - Right . All right , then we have to destroy all the stuff at the lab , the files , the disk drives , everything , everything here . Everything . I don 't care . The chip . - Do you know about the chip ? - What chip ? They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne . It must be from the other one like you . The CPU from the first Terminator . Son of a bitch ! I knew it ! They told us not to ask where they got it . Those lying motherfuckers . It 's scary stuff . Radically advanced . I mean , it was smashed . It didn 't work , but it gave us ideas , took us in new directions . I mean , things we would 've never ... All my work was based on it . It must be destroyed . Right . Can you get us in ? Past security ? I think so , yeah . When ? Now ? [ Sarah ] The future , always so clear to me , had become like a black highway at night . We were in uncharted territory now , making up history as we went along . Hi . Carl , right ? Friends from out of town . I just thought I 'd ... Hi . ... take them upstairs and show them around . Mr. Dyson , now , you know the rules concerning visitors in the lab . I need written authorization ... I insist . Don 't even think about it . Come on . It 's okay . It takes two keys to open the vault . They have to be turned simultaneously . The other one is in a locker at the security station . Gibbons ? Gibbons ! Come on , man ! You can 't leave the desk like that ! Shit . Gibbons . Oh , shit . Okay . My card should access this . - What ? What is it ? - Damn it . The silent alarm 's been tripped . It 's neutralized all the codes in the entire building . Nothing will open anywhere now . - We have to abort . - No . We go all the way . Okay ? You guys get started on the lab . I can open this . - I think it 's that guy from the mall . - It is the guy . Yeah , it 's him and the woman . Look , just send everything you got in the area right now . I have a personal entry code for the lab . It may still work . It 's no good . Let me try mine . John , fire in the hole ! Wait ! You can 't go in there . The fire set off the halon system . You have to wait a few minutes until the gas clears . Put this on . All right , let 's get to work . All units in the vicinity and all units able to respond a 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer Street , the Cyberdyne Building . Suspect one is white female identified as last name Connor , first name Sarah . Escaped last night from Pescadero State Hospital . Suspect two : White male fitting description of the individual wanted for the murder of police officers in 1984 . Suspects are armed and considered extremely ... All right . Seven-two-five-six . Yes . Easy money . Oh , shit . Not good . Not good . How we doing ? Primer cord is set . One more barrel , two more minutes . How do we ... - How do we set them off ? - Remote control . Piece of cake . - We got company . - Police ? - How many ? - All of them , I think . Go . I 'll finish here . Come on . I 'll take care of the police . Hey , wait ! You swore ! Trust me . You in the window ! Drop your weapon and place your hands on top of your head ! Holy shit ! That 's a damn mini-gun ! - Come on ! - Oh , shit ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Fire ! We go the same time , to the left . One , two , three , go . All right . Now , in order to get that out you have to just ... We got Skynet by the balls now , don 't we ? Come on , let 's book .

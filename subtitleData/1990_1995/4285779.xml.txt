 It 's that time of year , when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike . The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart . Every day I strive to make that dream come true . I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze . The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter . If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide . Bright shining clouds drift by . Here comes Sapphire ! The Jewels against the Shuffles . Here comes the climax ! Miku 's Special Training . What a dangerous feat . Sapphire , by brute force took The Shuffle 's Diamond out . What the ... She 's not human ... What ? Just like is says here , they made it though their first round with flying colors . What 's the problem ? What are you doing ? And it was such a nice picture of the four of them . You think that little game they were playing was Neo Pro Wrestling ? A game ? We 're back ! What gives you the right to say that ... You didn 't even watch the match till the end ... I couldn 't stand to watch it . What 's wrong ? These suits aren 't so bad . They 're well taken care of . Of course , they 're for the matches . Shame , they 're wasted on these girls . What the hell is this drunk talking about ? These suits are crying because you don 't even know how to make the best of them . Make the best of them ? What does that mean ? You don 't get it ? Take a minute to think about it . Why are you wearing the metal suits in the first place ? Your moves , a circus monkey could do better ... What ? All you do is jump around to put on a show . You have these great metal suits but you don 't even make good use of them . Same with your moves . You don 't know how to use the power of the suits . Hey , we 've done our research ! What the hell does a washed up coach like you know , anyway ? The way you are now , it 's pointless to teach you anything . So , you 're saying that we 've got no talent . All right , then let me ask you why do you wear the metal suits ? That 's obvious . ... for power and speed . Also , to record hit points during the fight . You saying that 's wrong ? That 's wrong . Then what are they for ? The metal suits are to look cool . To look cool , he says . How stupid . Are you serious ? Really , I was wondering what you had to say . Coach , I was taking you seriously . Please stop messing with us . I 'm serious . What the hell do you think Neo Pro Wrestling is ? A fighting art . Real fighting is what you do with your bare bodies . You prove your body and your strength . That 's what fighting is . So what other reason would there be for these metal suits other than to look cool ? Yeah , but the power is increased , and the fights are much more hard core . That 's why it looks cool . ... so it 's more hard core and faster and the moves are much more involved . Adding the flashy metal suits to the grand spectacle of fighting that 's what Neo Pro Wrestling is . You guys can 't even use the metal suits properly that kind of wrestling is unsightly . Our wrestling is unsightly ? Are you saying we 're ugly ? How dare you ... Use the suits properly how do we do that ? You want me to teach you ? H-Hey , wait a minute , Miku ... A-Are you okay ? No , I 'm not okay . I have no control of my hands and legs . Hey , Kinta , why the hell do you make stuff like this ? But ... Leave them on , even when you 're sleeping . What ? You 've got to be kidding . I can 't stand up anymore . Is wearing these really going to help us make better use of the suits ? Your weakness is your balance . Your balance is off , that 's why you can 't exploit the true power of the suits . If you can learn to function normally with those on you 'll be more balanced in your suits . What are those ? Muscle gear , to help the ladies ' posture . And just how long do we have to live in these ? Till your next match . What , that 's a week from now ! Mom , tell him ! We can 't go anywhere looking like this ! I 've left Eiichiro in charge of you . If he says so , that 's what you need to do . But ... One hundred ... One hundred one ... One , two , three ... Hey , Nana ! Nana , get away ! Are you trying to kill me ? Sorry . I 've had it ! What 's that ? They look stupid ! They 're laughing at us . Damn ! Hey , I did it ! I didn 't fall ! Good ! Good ! I think we 're getting used to these . Yeah . Big news ! Big news ! What , what 's the big news ? Coach Suo is quitting . What ? Are you sure ? I overheard him talking to the bosses . He doesn 't have it in him to coach anymore . What ? Woo hoo ! Yeah ! He 's finally leaving ! I 'm so happy ! Father , the championship is a huge success . Neo Pro Wrestling is getting world wide attention . Now all we need to do is make sure that Sapphire defeats Aquamarine and Shibata Consulting will control Neo Pro-Wrestling . I heard TWP won the first round . That was sheer luck . You mustn 't slack off . You must destroy them . We don 't need to get so worked up over such a small league . That is why I think you are naive . You mustn 't let up until the TWP has taken its last breath . Do you understand me ? Y-Yes . Getting it from Father again ? Brother ... You look exhausted . What 's wrong ? Why is father so hung up on TWP ? The man in charge there is Harajuku , right ? Yes . I guess you don 't know . What ? You 'll find out soon enough . Are you really quitting ? I never wanted to take this job in the first place . And now that I 'm doing it , it 's bringing back all sorts of bad memories . It 's Miku , isn 't it ? She 's an awful lot like Aquamarine when she was young . I nailed it , didn 't I ? That 's not it . They don 't have any potential , that 's why ... You don 't have to hide it . It 's written all over your face . You 're still hung up on her , after all this time . What ? If you 're a real man , why don 't you just deal with it , without the booze . I 've lost respect for you . I have no intention of leaving my precious girls in the hands of a spineless man like you ! What do you mean , they have no potential ? When did you go blind ? They 're rough around the edges right now but they can be polished into diamonds . Even you should be able to see that . I 'll do it my way , is that okay ? Have you heard me complain so far ? I 've sort of lost my edge , now that drunk is gone . True , he was a jerk of a coach , but now that he 's gone ... I kind of miss him . Who needs him , I feel great ! Yeah , that 's right . Miku ? I 've finally gotten used to them , it 's kind of a waste to stop now . I want to be able to take advantage of my metal suit . I want to be a cool Pro Wrestler . Weekly Neo Ring , editorial department . W-W-What ? A sneak attack , is this for real ? Yeah , I got an anonymous tip . Shibano 's Lady Ninjas are going to give a special performance , outside the ring . What a scoop ! 991 , 992 ... 993 , 994 ... Come on , you 're almost done ! Damn , if only we didn 't have the gear on , 1,000 would be a breeze . 999 , 1,000 Finished . That was hard . Your balance is so much better . I guess that drunk 's crazy ideas do work . What the ? What 's the matter , Ginko ? Who the hell are you ! We 're the protectors of justice . We 're gonna make sure that you don 't set foot in the sacred ring ever again . What ! What 's going on ? Coach , the Lady Ninjas ... Take off the muscle gear ! Kinta ! I know ! Sayaka ! Ginko ! Nana ! And the Star of the Beauties , Pretty Miku ! Together we are the Pretty Four ! I feel so light ! It 's so easy to move around ! I feel stronger . Not bad . Now we fight for real . Sayaka ! This is a great story ! Don 't lose them ! Right ! Watch out ! Ginko ! Just how low are you ? Miku 's Kick ! Got it ! Yes ! Justice will eventually prevail ! Miku , you did it ! Think I overdid it ? Hey , are you all right ? Wow , after all that , I 'm not even sweating . Hey , you 're right . I wonder if we look any cooler . Coach , it was all because of the muscle gear . Thank you ! So , think they 're stones worth polishing ? Say cheese ! I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile . Cheer up ! An angel without wings is just an ordinary person . Plain old hard work is more important than magic . In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest . Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats . Put your hands in your pockets . One day , they will come true the dreams that only you can dream . We got trouble ! What 's up , Miku ? There 's this young girl who wants to join the TWP . Will Maki become one of the Beauties ? Maki , let 's work hard ! But ... Next time ... Miku Under Suspicion . Miku 's Head Butt !

Poor Ryan , he 's probably accessing the files right now on a mission to save the guinea pigs in Pebbles Court . Don 't worry . He 's pumped full of enough A-59 to kill 20 rabid rottweilers . He won 't make it ' til morning . Homesville . Pebbles Court . Noble Family . Need the update . Cheryl and Brian Rand , terminated pregnancy . Sal is the man we need to look into . Sperm donation .

That 's either bad poetryor a pretty good clue . - Could be both . - Too many drugs . - Hello ? Oh , very good . Thanks for telling me now that I 've come out here . No , no , yes . Fine , no worries . Yes , good . Shit . - So , do you think that cop bought that shit about opal mining ? - Why not ? I saw something about it on TV . Or was it pearl diving ? Geezer , look at the photo again . Fucking hot . Man . You better be right about this , Gino . - Sal , I 'm not bullshitting you . She said she was a fucking doctor . We 're talking spermdonations , clean country air , and a health farm packed with women . And we get paid for it . - Man . This is gonna be ace . - Got a fag ? Ah . Bastard . Fuckin ' mongrel . Last time he pulls a shit act like that on me . Never been here before . Least it ain 't raining . Piss falls all the time in Sydney . You from Melbourne ? - Yeah . Yeah , yeah . - I need a place to stay . - It 's a killin ' machine , it 's got everything . Dum dum dum . Like a , chippy , chippy , come on , Frankie . Like a driving ' power , like a big fat tire , it 's got everything . - G 'day , mate , we 're lost . - Yeah , in the middle of nowhere . - On the knocker , you 're in a four horse town called Nowhere . A little Outback humor . - Well , it 's not on this , mate . - I suppose that 's big smoke humor . Yeah . You need a windscreen . - Yup . - Suey ! - That one 's Bab . And this is Bronto .

Look , I know this job cansometimes be a bit boring , but this is ridiculous . - What time is it ? - Are you alright ? - Yeah . I 'm okay . - I thought you were out . I buzzed you earlier , didn 't you hear me ? Some guy from the CIB wants to speak to you . Your secret life is catching up with you at last , Paul . Look , why don 't you take the rest of the day off . I 'll cover for you . - Yeah . Yeah . - I 'm gonna leave the keys here and I 'm gonna check the tires . - This place looks like shit . - I got lumbered with it after my divorce . I wanted a flat . There 's a spare bedroom through there and the shower 's down there . - Is it true what they say about you 's city men ? - It depends who says it . - Oh , shut up dirt bitch . - I 'm gonna check on the windscreen . You coming ? - Yeah , in a minute . - Smell that air , eh ? - Yeah , great . I guess it 's that clean country air we all hear about . - Yeah , well , everything in the country ain 't always that fresh . Where you from , son ? - Melbourne . - Whereabouts ? - Homesville . Homesville . Actually , it 's not much more than a dead end housing estate . - How many kids in your family ? - Italians , mate . You know , spermatos a elgrosso . - Yeah , families sure are ... - Gino ! - Strange things . Hit her right between the eyes ! Is that aboriginal for something ? - What the fuck is it ? - Don 't you know nothin ' ? It 's crazy word . - Shit . That 's the fuckin ' adrenal gland . You 're fuckin ' mad . - Psycho jelly !

This better be a good lead , buddy . - There 's a health farm there , Johnno . Do you some good . - This body is in great shape . I don 't need some doctor working up some bullshit schedule for me . I am in touch with my body , Sam . - Man , doing burnouts was never this good ! Unreal , un-fuckin ' - real . - Hey . Do you want a love bite ? - Sure . - Hey . Looks like your oldman 's seen better days . Was this a hospital or something ? - Oh , I don 't know . Pop never talked about those days . Says he worked in some kind of germ factory . - Pud is your old man , isn 't he ? - It 's all so mixed up . But Pud reckons we got this place from the family . - Shit ! - What the fuck was that ? - Nothing . It 's just a cock here . I 'll be back in a minute . - Fuckin ' Slab 's gone and done it again , the fuckin ' dirt bitch ! - How many times do I have to tell ya ! Keep in the family . Now we don 't have a choice . Go and find the other one ! - Nobody 's gonna take my car . Gonna drive it around . You 're goin ' nowhere in that truck . - Damn our cars . There 's never enough legroom . Sam , I 'll take care of this one . - Detective Phillips , hi . I 'm Shaan . - You got my message . - Yes , come into my office . No , never seen him before . - We found this on his body . - We 're marketing some of our products to help promote the resort . Poor man probably purchased some . Could he have bought those in Melbourne ? - Of course . How did he die ? - Car crash . - Oh , how tragic . - We 're trying to identify him . Do any of your staff come from Homesville ? - Homesville . Mm . - Pebbles Court , Homesville . - Not to my knowledge . All of our employees are local . - What does the V stand for ? - Vitamins , sergeant Johnson . Vitamins . You 're welcome to have a swim in the solar if you like . - Sounds tempting . - That 's very kind of you , miss , but we 're on duty . - You know this place isn 't bad . It 's almost like a holiday resort . - That 's the whole idea . - Sammy , I 'm not in that bad of shape , am I ? - It 's not what you got , it 's how you hold it . Go on , get in the car . We 've wasted enough time already . - Johnno ! You 're still here , man . What , the secret service job didn 't through , aye ? - Real bummer , man . They did a check on me and found out I knew you . - So , what are we here for , Willie ? - Well , the cell walls of his stomach have been eaten away by something corrosive . Enzymes , probably , but they 're not like anything I 've ever seen before . Maybe he was into new drugs . You know , strictly experimental stuff . Now , it could be a hybrid from any of those crazy psycho pharmaceuticals like pamalin , euphoria , deena , vasopressin . Or , maybe he was just sniffing textile . - That looks like a 9 . Paul Matthews . - Well , he was one healthy dude . Unnaturally healthy . Now , I 'm talkin new drugs here , right ? Not your 70s designer shit or your 80s ghetto powders . I 'm talkin ' fuckin ' 90s , man . Cognition enhancers , designed to take your mind into new introphenomilogical dimensions . - Kate ? - You are the last one . I have collected 12 others . This has been my quest . 13 male ribs . When I chose you at the airport , I became an image of your deepest fears . I am not your darkest fantasy . There are many women in the world like me , and there are many men in the world like you . And we are all in your mind . - Oh , hello . - Mm . - God . What a dickhead . - I had another one of those dreams . Maybe my body 's trying to tell me something . - Yeah ? You 're pregnant ? - Morning . Detective Phillips , CIB . Just wanted to ask you a few questions about the accident the other day . - Yes , awful , wasn 't it ? - Do you know Mr. Matthews over at number nine ? - We 've only just shifted here . This week , as a matter of fact . Me and Brian , he 's my husband , we haven 't met anyone else in the court yet . - No welcoming committee , aye ? Well , if you do happen to see anybody over at number nine , could you give us a call on that number ? Thanks . Oh , and congratulations . - Thanks . So , how 's the new house ? - It 's okay . I didn 't sleep too well last night , though . Oh , strange bedroom . You 'll get used to it . It could also be the infant . His protein intake is at the highest at the moment , particularly at night . Up until their birth , babies are the ultimate parasite . But , everything 's under control , so don 't you worry . And I 'll see you at the same time next week ? - See you then . See you . - You alone ? Yes , doctor . - We have to decrease Cheryl Rand 's dosage . - But that will invalidate the results . We can 't help that . The patient 's overreacting . - I suppose you 're going to ask for further retesting . - We have no other choice . But we can 't turn back . - We have to change our strategy , my girl . Ever since your boyfriend foamed at the mouth and kamikazed into Pebbles Court , we have to rethink our position . - How was I supposed to know he could handle that dose ? - Well , don 't you see that is the problem ? The drug still too unpredictable . - But I have set up an exclusive dealership with one of the largest chain stores in this country . If we delay delivery of the first ... - Fuck the chain store , what about the cops ? Something is wrong . Your boyfriend under-reacted . Cheryl Rand is overreacting . Mm . Mm . What about the Tortelli kids , have they turned up for their hormonal research yet ? They haven 't , have they ? - But we can run simultaneous sperm tests on the Noble family without halting the Cheryl Rand experiment . - Do not question me , Shaan . If this thing goes wrong , it will be worse than phthalimide . - Beauville ! We 're shipping the tablets this evening . - But that 's way ahead of schedule . Doctor Carrera ... - Doctor Carrera is incharge of infield placement . I 'm handling consignment and distribution . - I thought the Doc was in charge of CD . - We must change our strategy , my boy . We do as I say . - Don 't you ever hang up on me again . - But we haven 't spoken for so long . Sounds like we 're in business again . You know where to find me , Crackers . - Hi . You must be our new neighbor . I 'm Thompson Noble . - Hi . - And I 'm Angelica . - Cheryl . - Oh , kids , say hello . Now , this is Elloise , my eldest , and that little brat is Brandon . - Can we get a move on ? - Brandon . - Nice to meet you all . When you get back in , come over and meet Brian , my husband . So , where are you going ? - Oh , it 's a special secret . A holiday we 'll never forget . Bye . - Bye . Cheryl , it 's Doctor Carrera , Cheryl . - Doctor Carrera . I think ... Can you drop your placenta one month prior to birth . - No , I don 't think that 's possible , you see , um ... - Doctor Carrera , can you come over . Now . - I 'm on my way . - Brian , Doctor Carrera . Can you meet me at your place right away ? No , no , no , everything 's alright . I 'll explain when you get there . Now , there 's nothing to worry about . - Cheryl ! - I never would have expected him to be capable of such a thing . - Murder weapon 's covered in fingerprints . Probably his . You have any other patients in this court , Doctor ? - Why , yeah . - You know Mr. Paul Matthews ? - Matthews . No . - Over at number nine . - Why , do you suspect him of doing this ? - We had a bad accident here the other day . We have reason to suspect that the victim was on his way to see Paul Matthews . Doctor . Do you know of a viral disease that , in it 's first phase , has hallucinogenic delusions . - Well , yes , yes , there are many of them . - And in its second phase , glandular complications . - Most viruses initially effect cerebral perception in one way or another . Dizziness , vertigo , tunnel vision . - Was Cheryl Rand taking any kind of special medication . - No . Not to my knowledge . - It 'll show up in the poor women 's autopsy , I guess . Welcome to Vimuville , I 'm Shaan . - Mr. Noble , my wife . - Alright ! - Dimitra . Folks , meet my tireless assistant , Dimitra . - Hi . - Any problems , she 's yours for the asking . Gotta zap . I 'll meet you back at reception in an hour , and I 'll give you your daily fitness programs . Dig in . - All the food you see here is of the same meganutritional value , designed to appear to both adults and children alike . You know how it is . Positive deception . - Now , why hasn 't somebody thought of that before ? - Excuse me . - This place sucks , you know . - You 're so perceptive , Bran . - Ooh , a bit of the PMT , eh , sis ? - Fuck off , wiener dick . - You bet I 'm gonna fuck off . Tonight I 'm gonna sleep under the stars . - You 're such a he man , Brandon . - At least I don 't let mom tell me what to wear . - I hope you break your neck . - Ladies and gentlemen , this one will be over the fuckin ' top . - Honey . - Mm ? - Are you sure about Brandon ? - Oh , don 't worry . I saw him smuggle him tin tin with his luggage . He 's camping outside tonight . - Got a real gem for your Pebbles Court collection . Now check this out . - Holy earache . - And for the grand finale . - I 've stored the Nobles urine samples . Um , can me and Bough have some more vitties ? So , what happened to your last supply ? Those V-2s , they 're piss weak . How about some 44s ? - Forget it . You 'll have to wait until your next scheduled ration . Homesville , Pebbles Court . Noble family urine analysis . Hello , I 'm not here just now . Make it short , I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . - Don 't hit the roof when you see this data . I know we can push ahead with some further tests on the Nobles tomorrow . Their urine looks really good . - Yanta-fucking-bulla . Your friendly health farm hostess , hey Sam ? - Get a chopper . Now . - Just what the doctor ordered . - Did you see Angelica 's split ends ? - I 'd rather see your split end . - Bough , this is getting a little out of hand . We haven 't even had breakfast yet . - But , I 'm not hungry . Well , yes I am . - Oh , Bough , stop it . Stop it . - Ow . - I 'm going to the bistro to have some breakfast . You should take a cold shower . Mm , baby , oh yeah . Yeah , baby , baby , baby . Oh yeah , oh yeah . - So . Still into driving ' a merc , are we , Crackers ? - Don 't forget that your advanced hearing is the result of my chemical breakthroughs , partner . - At least I had the guts to experiment with the drugs on myself . - That is what partnerships are all about . - So . How 's it going , Cracker ? Done any good drugs lately ? - You know what I want . - Suey ! - What is this . - Well . When we parted company , I made sure I took a little something from the lab . I knew you 'd give yourmaster plan a second shot . You see , without that little additive , the body cannot control its new powers . It might even explode . Very fucking messy . It 's all falling apart , eh , Crackers ? All those people at Vimuville . You and your megabods ! You fucking ... You were wrong then , and I 'll make sure you 're wrong now . I love it ! I need it ! Yeah ! In the power machine ! All right ! Hold tight ! - Oh shit . - Thomps . You alright ? It 's alright , nothing to worry about . - Thomps ? Elloise ! Elloise ! - Shaan . Quick , mom needs help . Something 's wrong with dad . - Vimuville , the best place in the world for your body . Quick , in the car ! Oh my God ! - Kill them ! - This must be the place . - Quick , get the doctor . We 've got to see the doctor immediately . - I 'm sorry , you 're going to have to take ... - No , don 't give me that shit . Just get the doctor . You 've got to come up to Vimuville . Something terrible has happened . - Vimuville . What are you doing up at that old chemical dump ? I haven 't been there since it was closed by the health commission . That must 've been over 20 years ago . - The food . The food , they 've all eaten it . - Yes , madame , I 'm listening . - Mom . - Mm . Mm . The human body . At best , a neglected engine running on cheap fuel . - The way I see it , Doc , you 're running on empty . - You would not have the faintest idea of what your body could do , if it had the right formula . But without that fuel , you are nothing . A zero . - You 're finished , Doctor Carerra . - No , not quite , Detective Phillips . - Don 't even think about it . Police force 5 to Airborn 930 , is Sam still with you ? Yup , still here . - We put up that quarantine you requested on Pebbles Court . But , Sam . - Yeah ? - That fuckin ' thing 's been chucking up for the past 20 minutes now . It 's wall to wall shit all over the place . Now , look , we finally caughthim in your office , Sam . Now , the only trouble is , young Jordan 's trapped in there with him . - In my office ? - Move it ! Every one covered . Move it ! Keep down ! Keep those corridors covered . Keep them covered ! - Fuck a duck . - Jordan now . Jordan now , come . Jordan . - Sam , over here . Keep away from the door . What the fuck is wrong with this guy ? Is he sick or infected or what ? Sarge , getme the fuck out of here ! - Get the paramedics . Get Willy up here now ! - Hooey . He 's got my fucking shirt on . - Cognition enhancers , eh , Willy ? You should see the bodies coming down from that crazy , bloody farm . - You should see the new death certificates . Death by hypernatural causes . I kid you , but I love this fuckin ' job . Ooh , not feeling queasy are we , Johnno ? - What would you suggest , Willy ? - I , uh ... I suggest some aspirin , Johnno . - Sam . Would you get me some aspirin , please . - Ah , catch that speed freak yet . - Yeah , he bagged himself . - That guy was one crazy asshole . Detergent ? Jesus . Yeah , that 's right , thanks , Sarge . Be careful out there .

 Feelings ... I don 't know . Everything 's ... Everything 's normal . Then , out of nowhere , suddenly they 're tearing at me . I don 't know if it 's the past or the future , heaven or hell . Scared ? Yeah ... I 'm scared . Something 's happening , again , and I want to know what it is or who 's responsible . What do you know about the truth ? The truth 's all twisted . Go back to what ? Think about it . What would it really be like to go back and to know the future ? Everyone I grew up with , everyone I knew , they 're dead , or in some retirement home . I go visit them . The kids I grew up with don 't even know who I am . Why should they ? I don 't even know who I am . These feelings ... how long have they been going on ? I don 't know . Three months . That was when you lost your business . What 's that got to do with anything ? Now the bank wants to foreclose on your house . I told those guys I just need a little time , that 's all . How 's Benjamin ? How is he , David ? He misses his mother . School ? He 's doing fine . Missed five days last month . You seem to know all the answers , doctor ! Why bother asking the questions ? All I want to know is what 's going on . You owe me that ! Nothing . Nothing 's going on . These hallucinations coincide with high-stress incidents ... The death of your wife , collapse of your business . A period of remorse , of introspection , even resentment is inevitable . You have to come to terms , to accept what 's happened . You have to move on . Are you finished ? David . David ! The Navy wants to know if you 'll consider coming back . They 'll clear the slate , take care of the mortgage , settle the bills .

It 's exactly what you think it is , sir ... Our invisible aircraft . It 's an acoustical tracking system . We picked it up from a disemployed Soviet physicist . Sold it to us cheap . We 're failing , gentlemen . Radar stealth is dead . The truth is that if you want to make something invisible , you have to make it disappear . Yeah ! Way to connect , Benny ! That 's a double ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Throw it ! Safe ! What ? All right . Nice hustle , Ben . Save some for the opening game . Dad ! Sorry , coach . I got to go . Be on time Saturday , Benny . Remember , this is opening game this weekend . Let 's go . Next batter . Come on , Joey ! You 're up ! Heads up , guys . Come on . Look alive . All right . All right . So mark says Terminator kills predator , but I say no way . Predator 's cool , right ? Then Paul goes , " no . Robocop kills them both . " What do you say ? About what ? Dad ! Terminator and predator against robocop . Who wins ? I don 't know ... Superman . Superman ? Come on , dad . He 's a wimp . Superman 's not a wimp . That 's the man of steel . Yeah , well , adamantium 's harder than steel . That 's why superman retired . Ada what ? Adamantium ... Hardest metal on earth . Look , I got some . Traded my lunch for it . See ? You can 't break it . Don 't do that . Let me see that . This is what put superman out of business ? Yep . Think it 'll go good on old blue ? Well , we 'll give it a shot . Really ? Cool ! It 's still another sunny day in sunny Southern California on 102.2 fm here in Santa Paula . It 's may 3 , 1993 , and the second hand is ticking on towards 5 : 03 in the afternoon . Coming up , we have another uninterrupted hour ... I 'm already fast as Tommy . Maybe faster . But he 's got better stuff . I get my curve ball going , I know I 'll start . Coach said so . Don 't throw the ball in the house . Wouldn 't that be cool ... Me winning the opening game ? I 'll help you , later ! When ? The game 's on Saturday , and I really want to ... I told you not to do that ! I 'm working ! Nothing 's broken . Good . Now , take it outside , all right ? Will you come with me ? Not right now . But the curve . You always say ... Damn it ! Sorry , dad . The curve . The curve . You want to see the curve ? Yeah . All right . I 'll show you the curve . Remember , it 's just a swing of the arm does it , all right ? Elbow high , wrist relaxed , just like that . You see it ? Kind of . Get your bat . Some guys try and force it with the wrist , but you can 't . Watch the ball . See the action ? Yeah ! Give me another . Here we go . Last strike . Bottom of the ninth . Bases loaded . Checks his man on first . The pitch . Oh , and he 's out of there ! Lucky catch . There 's nothing wrong with a little luck . Come on , dad . Throw me another . You go on outside and practice . I need someone to catch the ball . Go on . I 'll play catch with you after dinner . O.K. After dinner . 1943 , the Philadelphia experiment . Professor James longstreet 's baby-step attempts to cloak a U.S. Navy destroyer from enemy radar . Instead , the entire ship vanishes from the face of the earth for almost one hour ... Disappears , gentlemen . The same year Berlin scientist friedreich mailer , my father , initiates radar-jamming research to assist in daylight bombing raids . Marginal success , although one prototype aircraft is rumored to have achieved invisibility . 1984 , Nevada , shortly after my father 's death , longstreet incorporates mailer 's research in his own endeavors to generate an electromagnetic missile shield over a small town near a military base . This time , an entire town is gone for nearly one day . Analyses were debated , reports written , filed ... Forgotten . Mailer and longstreet 's research was written off as freakish acts of nature until now . Gentlemen , from the ashes of these misfires , I am here to tell you will rise a technology , a tool , a weapon that will burn most brightly in this country 's arsenal . Follow me ... And I will show you the future . Imagine being able to move an object from point a to point b quickly , silently , invisibly . Imagine instantaneous deployment with unlimited range . Imagine omnipresence . Imagine no more , gentlemen , for I give you super stealth . The Philadelphia experiment ... Perfected at last . [ Sizzling ] Nearing critical spectrum . Dad ! Dad , what 's happening ? What 's going on ? Go to your room . Please . Go ! Not bad , sir . Not bad at all . It gets even better . Super stealth is the weapon that will enable us to seize this moment of detente and ... What about human pain and misery ? What about the world as we know it , changed instantaneously ? Professor longstreet . This technology is your vision realized . We 've discussed its potential . [ Longstreet ] Yes , but things have changed . You 've gone too far . The Philadelphia experiment ... That ship didn 't disappear into some dimensional waiting room . We cut a hole through 40 years of time and almost shattered the continuum . But we 've refined the process so time isn 't a variable . Potential for errors is virtually nil . Tell them about the people who went through the vortex . The young men 's bodies melted into the hull of that ship . Only one man traveled successfully through the vortex . His unique metabolism created his own individual continuum . These experiments are destabilizing his DNA , literally tearing him apart . It must end now . The intricate weave of time is not ours to unravel . We 'll reconvene tomorrow at 0800 hours . You 'll have our decision then . Thank you , Professor . You swore to me theoretical research strictly . You opened pandora 's box , James . This is what came out . Arrogance and ambition ... It 's a dangerous mix . Fly in the ointment . Yes , sir . Well , whatever happens , sir , it 's been a pleasure working for you . Gratitude is the disease of dogs . Nietzsche . No . Stalin . [ Telephone ringing ] [ Ring ] Yeah . David . You son of a bitch . You lied to me . I didn 't know the extent of it , honestly . They 're further along than I thought . Dangerously so . No shit . You listen to me . I 'm getting the hell away from you and whatever you 're doing . I need to talk to you . You 've got to listen to me . Forget it . Not this time . You 're not dragging me in again . Go find someone else . Oh , Benny . Benny ! Where you driving to , kid ? Nowhere . Can I get in ? Are you dying , like mom ? No . No , I 'm not dying . Well , something happened , son . It 's hard to explain , but it 's hurting me . If I can get away from here , from this place , maybe it will stop hurting , that 's all . Can I come ? Of course you can . Where are we going , dad ? I don 't know yet , son . Look , I know it 's been tough . I know you miss your mom . I miss her , too . But you and me together , we 're a team , right ? Sometimes I don 't get to spend as much time with you as I 'd like . As long as you and I stick together , it 'll get better , I promise . No matter where we go , it 'll get better . I know what we could do . We 'll fix old blue . This piece goes here when we 're done , and we 'll drive someplace where you won 't get sick anymore . That 's a great idea . We better go inside and pack . We got to get going . O.K. Could we wait here a minute , dad ? You bet we could . What 's the flight plan ? It 's a routine squadron reassignment . North Atlantic route to Wiesbaden , Germany , nuke payload , one pilot , uninformed of our plans . I 'm aware of that . The DNA testing 's incomplete . We have yet to determine human resistance ... I 'm aware of that ! Look around you , Hank . Look at the scale of what we have put together on a slush fund shoestring . Super stealth is too important to be hamstrung by political indifference . My father never let ideology interfere with his research , never let red tape strangle his science , and I intend to abide by that legacy . When that plane disappears over newfoundland and instantaneously reappears over Wiesbaden , we will be vindicated , and no one will want to pull the plug . Now , no middle ground . You 're in , or you 're out . I 'm in , sir . You can count on me . Good . To the left . There she is . Target . Locked . Location ? Northeastern zone approaching newfoundland . Bring up the NORAD status map . There ! Station 6-3-0 newfoundland . Get it ! Interlocked . Tying into the subcarrier . Now ! We 're tracking . Overlay coordinates . Verified . We are ... In !

Remember Philadelphia ? Longstreet ? Amazing . 50 years have been very kind to you , David ... Or else incredibly cruel . I can 't believe you 're a part of this . Body , mind , and soul , I 'm afraid . 50 years . We were all so young . There was hope ... Such faith in our cause , endless strength to fight the good fight . I know . I was there . Until ' 43 , may 4th . I disappeared your ship , and you never came back . There were stories you 'd gone forward in time . 24 hours later , it didn 't matter . Go on . 5th of may , the Phoenix flew ... Dropped her bombs on Washington , D.C. 15 million people gone . Took me 20 years to figure it out ... Why the Phoenix never flew again , where it came from , and what happened to the damn thing . Then one of our operatives found this . My God , it 's a stealth . Nuclear-armed . Then it all fell together . The doubts I had about you and the damn Philadelphia experiment became nightmares . We did cut a hole in time . The same way we sent you forward from ' 43 , that plane got sucked back there , landed in the heart of Nazi Germany . It 's my fault ... All of it . A foolish young man 's pride opened pandora 's box . All this ... Everything you see here came out of it . This man ... Who is he ? Friedreich mahler . Took credit for the plane . Claimed he built it . Was a hero when the Phoenix struck . Turned scapegoat when he couldn 't build a replacement . See , he didn 't know the plane 's real power . How could he ? It was lost in the blast from its own bombs . Mahler killed himself in ' 65 , utterly disgraced . But like all good aryans , he brought forth a son who 's become obsessed with the Phoenix , obsessed with time . He studied everything we did in ' 43 ... The ship , you , all of it . He 's reopened the Philadelphia experiment ... Convinced he can go back 50 years , warn his father and change the Phoenix 's flight path so it survives the blast . You mean ... He 's rebuilt it ? Your machine ? He 's close . He 's developing a plasma that simulates your DNA so he , too , can survive the vortex .

I told you , never again . What 's done is done . We can 't change it . You don 't understand . We cannot continue to tamper this way . There 's a different world , longstreet , with a different history . I was just there yesterday . It 's better than it is here , much better . It 's not perfect . It 's got its problems , but not like this . It 's a nightmare here because here was not meant to be . But it 's been this way for 50 years . No . No , it 's been this way for one day . I swear . It 's true . Don 't you see ? We won the war . We ? We won the war ? Yeah . Yes . There 's a cemetery in old D.C. Where they let us put out markers for the victims of the Phoenix ... Stretches for Miles . This country was buried there ... 6 feet under . Gathering the ripened fruit of their labors like playful children . Safe under their watchful father 's eye ... Look at me , Jess . We 've got to talk about what 's going to happen . There 's too much talk , and I know what 's going to happen . We 'll fail , or we 'll succeed . If you destroy the Phoenix , we win the war . There 's more to it than that ... A lot more , I 'm afraid . If we succeed ... I take that plane out , then this world ... This place ...

I 'm so pleased . Are you ? Don 't look at me . Look straight ahead . To be honest , I never expected this . I didn 't think you would . What went through your mind on your way here ? Truth twisted ... Who 's responsible . Well , responsibility is generally one of those things claimed by the righteous , whereas consequences are assigned to the meek . What 's your choice ? Strength ... To make the right choice . Well ... You seem strong to me , not , uh , worried of frightened . Powerful . Even heroic . Are you a hero ? I could be . You could be ... If what ? If I killed you . Do you think you could ? Sir , this ... Shh . You want to murder the king in his own castle . It 's very heroic . Take it . Have you considered the consequences of pulling the trigger ? Yes . Then why don 't you take it ? This is insane . Stay back , Decker . This is the hero 's moment . He 's thought it through . He knows what he 's doing . It 's simple , isn 't it ? You pull the trigger , and I 'm dead , and you 're stuck right here . No . You think not ? Then shoot . I will . God damn you ! I can 't . Why not ? I don 't belong here ... This place , this time . I need to get back to where I 'm from , back to my home , my family , where I know who I am . Look at me now .

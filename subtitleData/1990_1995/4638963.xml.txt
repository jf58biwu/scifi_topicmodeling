 In a moment , your brain will be mine ! And I will use it for my experiences ! But , who are you ? I am the Saviour ! If my mother knew that I was convoying through France two particularly hostile E.T. specimens . In company of a guy who eats all the time . Frankly , this is not a life . She wanted me to be an artist . Why do you complain ? We 're cool with these two chums . When we 're at the D.S.T. lab , ( Directory.Surveillance.Territory ) ( No kidding , it 's real ! ) we put them in the hands of the tech men and we 're going to eat a big slice of pizza ! If me make it to Paris . You got a good look at these guys , I mean these things ? They look like they want to eat us raw . Don 't worry . If one of them makes a wrong move I put a bullet in his head ! We 'll say in the report that he tried to escape or that he played with matches . Did you hear that , the big bozos from outer-space ? You 'd better be quiet ! They 'll take care of you in Paris . The white smocks will make you injections , put thermometer in your ass and more . A real boner , huh ? It 's so hot in this car ! To think we were freezing this morning . Meteo is going bonkers . I forgot to tell you . Our next mission is to snuff the weatherman ! Say ! It looks like it 's them putting all this heat in the car . You crazy ? They 're overheating , I swear to you ! They 're burning ! The bastard ! They will make us burn with the car if they keep on like that ! I 'm calling the boss . Call on our secret frequency . It 's more prudent . Hello ? Headquarters ? It 's Inspector Tardieu calling . We have an issue with the E.T.s. Hello ? You hear me ? H.Q. my eye ! It 's you gettin my cue in your ass ! Marseille ! Stop fooling around ! You bastard ! It 's me , Charlie in his mad truck ! Yo , Babouille ! You stupid idiot , get off of this frequency immediately . You 're a menace to the territory security . Yo , Marseille ? Do you copy me ? Charlie , here . Cops on the National . Soften up on the pedal when near St Maxime . Get the fuck out of here or I send you in jail for high treason ! What did he answer ? He told me to go and get fucked . Look at this ! They 've burned the seats ! We must absolutely call Headquarters . Stop at the next phone booth . D.S.T. ? Tardieu here . Give me Captain Rollin . Yes . Hello ? What 's the trouble , Tardieu ? We 're near St Maxime . We 'll be in Paris before noon but the E.T.s are overheating . What do we do ? Make for the best . We need these specimens as fast as possible . No , you can 't make a pause . Yes , it 's for our scientific research . That mission is classified Top Secret . Is that clear ? Alright . We 're coming . What a bloddy fool ! Some trouble , Captain ? I hope not . How smart from the Captain ! If he thinks we 're having fun with these things . Believe me , Captain . We 're not having fun . We wish to end this as quickly as possible . Shit ! Shit ! It 's a slip-up ! Can 't an honest citizen have a quiet pee anymore ? See you tomorrow , Captain . See you . By the way , if my wife is calling , I 'm still at the conference . Understood ? No problem . Still this damn phone ! Captain , we have troubles . Big troubles . Tardieu and Moulin screwed-up . The specimens escaped near St Maxime . What ? It 's a disaster ! There 's more . Moulin has been killed and Tardieu has shot a passer-by . A slip-up . It couldn 't be worse . Now you 're gonna tell me the passer-by was an Iranian Diplomat or a greenpeace activist ? No . Just a passer-by who was passing by . A certain ... Gaston Pinard , unemployed . Perfect ! One less for the statistics ! A young tenderfoot like Tardieu should not have been assigned such a mission . Now he got to deal with P.J. ( C.I.D. equivalent ) . It 's out of our hands . You understand ! Absolute secret on the case . It 's an order . A motorcycle almost got on fire while being parked in front of the post office . His owner got a great scare . West News , hello ? No . I 'm not doing police slip-ups . I 'm giving you someone else . ... near the swamps . A young girl mysteriously disappeared last night while going to her grandma 's . Only her bicycle was found out . This case is similar to another one concerning a missing girl near St Maxime 's swamps . St Maxime 's champs have a hard time coming if they wish to steal the leadership from the St Jules en Garette 's team in the regional Cup taking place next thursday . Hello ? Hey ? Hello ? We haven 't been introduced . My name is Helena . - You 're new here ? - I 'm here since a few days . Pleased to meet you . I 'm Robert . I 'm in charge of the obituary column . Come in . Please sit down . A Scotch , Captain ? No need to be so formal in your bedroom . Yes for the Scotch . I 've had a stressing day . Don 't worry . Your evening will be more pleasant . You weren 't comfortable with us ? Doctor Kill will be angry ! Very angry ! Take her to the boat ! And hurry up ! Come on , get in ! Faster ! Faster ! So , dear colleague ! You came here to shoot our citizens in the street ? How delicate of you ! There 's no one left to kill in Paris ? Superintendant , I thought that man was one of the two E.T.s we were convoying and which escaped after killing my partner . So you want to make a career move ? I 'd like to take care of the hot cases . Hot cases ? I think I have the right article for you . Really ? D.S.T. is toying with aliens now ? I think you took a blow on the head . You have no right to speak to me on this tone . I 've been assigned a Special Mission and I 'm asking you to put your men under my leadership . These creatures are very dangerous ! They must be captured as fast as possible . You 're right ! Count on me to put my force in the hands of an alcoholic of your kind ! You 're pushing too hard ! Maybe you 'll believe the D.S.T. Captain . Give me that phone . D.S.T. Special Operations , Hello ? Give me Mr Rollin , Head director of Special Operations . Mr Rollin is in conference right now . If it 's urgent , I 'll see what I can do . Hold on . Now for a few tests ... I have to make a phone call . I 'm sorry . Hello . Yes ? Mr Rollin . Sorry to disturb you . Tardieu is on the line . He insists on speaking to you . It 's you , Tardieu ? You know you 're disturbing me ? Hello , Head Director . I 'm at the St Maxime 's precinct . Could you confirm to that guy that I 'm on a Special Operation ? Which S.O. ? You 're hallucinating , old pal ! What ? The E.T.s we had to bring to the lab ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You should have taken some holidays . But you know that ... Don 't insist . I can 't do anything for you . Give me that Superintendant . Alright . Hold on . Hello ? Yes ? Do you still have your ma ? Yes . Why ? Tell her to get ready to bring you some oranges very soon . It 's alright for you , Helena ? All is fine , Mr Editor . You can call me Frankie . I would be delighted to have dinner in your company tonight . Another time maybe , Mr ... Frankie ! Nice doll ! Beware ! Ginette ! Beware ! Beware ! Look at your line ! Too late . Roger ! Did you hear that noise ? It 's impossible to hear some noise in the wilderness , Ginette ! You 'd better be more careful with your line ! What kind of junk have you still bought for baits ? They 're from the supermarket ? I bought them from Father Boudu . Father Boudu ! That 's the last straw ! There 's no more fish in this river . All because of their chemical polluting ! You , Roger , you 'll keep on mumbling even in your death bed . Hello ? Mum ? All is fine here . They gave me a great welcome at the newspaper . It 's my third day and I 'm already in charge of the news item . It 's great ! I think the Editor really likes my work . And there 's that very cute journalist but he 's also very shy . No . I already told you . I 'm safe here . There 's nothing very dangerous happening in the area . Keep quiet . I 'll warn you if I 'm covering a war or a earthshake . I kiss you . So what ? What 's the idea of leaving good Dr Kill without saying good-bye ? Am I so frightening ? Sicko ! She 's terrorized , Boris , I assure you ! Let 's take her to the lab ! You 've worked on this fossile for a long time ? The Editor says it 's more than enough for the news item column . And when it 's too used we can always sell it to a third-world journalist . Michael , don 't forget your covering for the Municipal Choir tonight . Could I go with you ? It 's stressing me to see my patients terrorized before their operation ! I 'm gonna learn you a swell song ! " It 's Dr Kill 's song , he puts their heart in shapes , he hits bullseye everytime , with all the young girls he 's mutilating " But only to scientific ends . You 're crazy ! What do you want with me ! I 'm going to explain , young fool , why I 'm conducting these experiments . When I was in medecine school I discovered a gland contained only in the female brain . The brain remains the last part of the human body partially unknown to scientifics . This gland I 've named K is an evil concentrate . It commands all the criminal impulses . It is ineffective most of the time . The man possesses such a gland but it 's much smaller compared to the woman 's . And it 's difficult of access because it 's located behind the X gland which command sex impulses . I 'm the only one who can reactivate the K gland . And thanks to it I will be soon at the head of an army of young girls gifted with an uncommon bestiality . You 're sick ! Release me , maniac ! You should fell the effect of the injection very soon . Put her on the operation table , Boris . Where do you think you 're going ? You wanted to escape again ! It 's not very nice of you ! I 'm not so bad . I 'm a scientific and a great artist at the same time . You heard my song earlier . But I 'm also a plastician as you 're about to discover now ! Not really my style , this kind of choral ! Yep . It wasn 't that great . - Who 's that girl ? - I don 't know her . Michael , where are you ? Who are you ? I 'm the Saviour ! Hello , Helena . I was very worried . You drop me good , last night , dirty coward . I ran for help but when I came back with the police you had disappeared . Listen , Helena . That 's not what you think . You know , I 'm not a super-hero . And that girl looked so fierce . I thought it would be more helpful for me to run and get some help . I believe you but I don 't understand that girl 's motivations . She was completely mad ! She wouldn 't be one of your girlfriend driven mad by seeing us together ? I generally choose quieter girls . But how did you manage to get out of her grip ? I 'm practicing heavy-lifting every week and I managed to tame her . No . In fact , something extraordinary happened . By the way . Do you want to have lunch with me tomorrow ? Tomorrow at noon ? Yes , I have nothing special to do . I 'll be there . You know , I really saw that mysterious character . He saved us from our assailant . You don 't believe me ? I don 't know . Some people have seen that sort of super-hero in the last few years . A Superman clone , protector of the poor and the weak . Police doesn 't believe it and the Editor laughs his arse off when I mention him . I 'm sure of what I 've seen . He came out of nowhere and saved my life . He even talked to me . What did he say ? He said , I 'm the Saviour . You alright ? Ready for tuesday 's game ? I hope you like rabbit with olive . It 's perfect . I hope it 's cooked enough . Only one way to be certain . To taste it . By the way , you live in the area since a long time ? Long enough to have several snapshots of every citizen of that old city ! The Editor doesn 't seem to appreciate you . It 's a fact . I 'm in charge of the news item for 5 years . But I 'm not complaining . Who are these guys ? They assaulted Nader ! Let 's scram , guys ! You like it ? My rabbit ? You like it ? Very good . Not enough salt but very tasty . An urgent appointment . See you tomorow at the News . See that ! The nerve of this guy ! Don 't get near ! And don 't come back ! Go back to your home and have a nice cup of tea . I 'm fed up with all these people having hallucinations ! Even my own reporters ! Shit ! A strange guy ! You saw the Savior too ? What 's this stupid article ? You think you 're funny with your grotesque super-hero tales ? You dreamed of him ! Don 't forget I 'm paying you to write the sports column , not comic-book stories ! I 've seen him . He 's alive ! So dear Doctor , what lucky chance brings you here ? I would like to know the follow-up on the investigation on the crimes and disappearances in the area . The investigation is making no headway , I won 't try to deny it . All we know is that they 're two different cases . All the corpses we found had burning marks . As for the disappearances they only concern young women between 16 and 25 years old . Very strange . I 've been observing for a few weeks in my study cases of acute schizophrenia on young women . Add to that crisis of extreme agressivity followed by total anmesia . You think these crisis could lead them to murders . I 'm convinced . It seems they 're being manipulated . You 're right on time , Lieutnant ! I 've heard about mysterious creatures competiting with us in the area by strangling some poor inhabitants . It recalls me a prophecy by Nostradamus , I 'm quoting , " Two demons coming from a far away planet named " Assassinat " will come one day on earth to annihilate the human race . " The planet " Assassinat " ... Exterminating Demons ... I 'd like to examinate those creatures . Meanwhile , bring me more young women . I need to get my hand in . There never was so much crimes in this city than during the last weeks . A little round in the city is needed ! I 'm sorry to disturb you . Not at all . Sit down . I 'd like another glass of soda . These mosquitos really get on my nerves . Last night I was completely devoured . It 's normal with those swamps.There 's nothing more awful than mosquitos . What a strange idea you had to choose a camping so remote ? - Do you think those swamps are inhabited ? - I don 't think so . You know what they say in my book about this area ? Let me guess ? Lots of good-looking guys ? You 're going to be disappointed . Nice cows , then ? I 'm serious . They say that after dark horned monsters crawl out of the earth to capture pretty girls like us . You think I 'm going to buy that ? Do as you want , but it 's true . I 've read articles on that . Lots of girls disappeared lately and their corpses were never discovered . You dumb cunt , you 're frightening me ! Why ? I 'd like to meet some monsters . Others than you ! You 're not funny . Let 's go . That 's it . Go and jump in their arms . They will feast upon you ! Listen ! Footsteps ! Surely the girls in the tent nearby . I 'll get a look . Be careful . You see ! We won 't be devoured tonight ! - You think they 're their boyfriends ? - I don 't think so . Who are these two guys ? We shoot them ? Come in . Sit down . What 's the reason of your visit , Misses ? I 'm certain it 's two different gangs operating in the area . One gang strangle his victims leaving burning marks . The other kidnap only very young women . Like the camping girls . But those who assaulted me really looked like aliens . Witnesses told that they saw some of the kidnapped girls reappearing and showing strong signs of agressivity . Hello , West News . What if Dr Killerman was not dead ? Well . Let 's try again . What did you exactly see ? We were having dinner under the tent in the mosquitos ' company . Suddenly we heard some noise . We went out and saw people fighting in the tent nearby . Could you describe those people ? We didn 't get a good look . It was dark . I went out again after a while and I saw two people escaping . Me I 've seen a lot more . Six or seven , at least . How much exactly , then ? Two . They escaped silently . You said they were shouting ? It wasn 't them shouting . They were very quiet . Anyway , they had heavy leather masks , like muzzles . Not at all . They wore soldier uniforms and had hoods . You couldn 't see . She was hiding under her sleeping bag , Mr Superintendant . You were afraid too . You were shaking like a dead leave . Misses , you know the penalty for a false testimony ? Now , you two have to agree . Either it was " Don 't Look Now : We 're Being Shot At " or it was " Encounter of the third kind " . Let 's start to the beginning again . Forceps . What a pity , Boris ! The K gland got stuck between the hypotalamus and the electro-hormone . Let 's check the results on the other girl . Put the new specimen on the table . We 're going to see how she 's reacting . You can inject her with the reactivation serum , Boris . While I 'm performing the trepaning . It worked , Boris ! The K gland is sur-activated ! We 're far away from everything here . - I can 't walk another mile . - How is your knee ? It 's alright . I think we 're having visitors . Boys ? - Not my style . - Probably hunters . - You told us we would be alone in this refuge . - You 're not gonna die . Silence ! Come with us ! - I told you the Dr wanted them alive ! - Look ! They 're escaping ! So , you 're that famous reporter from West News ? Welcome to my small press conference ! I will talk about me and then you 'll be released . You see , my cartesian mind is greatly complemented by my artistic influences . It brings me a great peace of mind . In the end , isn 't scientific research similar to the search for beauty ? Come on ! So , you lost one of the girls during your last raid ? It 's annoying . Her modification did not last long enough . But I know the reason . I will reinforce the K gland sur-activation for our next patients . But let 's see that new specimen you brought me . Tell me , Boris ? Did you think about giving her a sedative ? You 're a nice specimen , Miss . I 'm congratulating you and if I could I would also congratulate your parents . Come with me , Boris ! Let 's make preparations for our revenge ! And now , let 's get started , Bobo ! Did you already stare at the stars for hours at night ? Yes , once . And I caught influenza . - True ? - No , I 'm kidding . I 'm staring at stars some nights . I 'm certain there are others inhabited planets in our universe . But tell me , do you hope to see the Saviour in his big red floating cape flying high above the houses ? - Don 't mock me ! I 'd like to meet him again . It would be the best time of my life . - Maybe it can be arranged . - You know him ? I was lucky to meet him too . He 's a charming man even if he 's a little bit odd . You could get me an interview with him ? I 'll try . Be tomorrow at midnight in the Dungeon . Let 's ask her a few questions ! How do you feel now ? I want to kill . What 's your new purpose in life ? To do the laundry , to cook or to paint your nails green ? My purpose is to obey to Dr Kill . Dr Kill is my new master . This young woman will be the best asset of my army . Then I could rule the world by terror and crime ! I feel like I 'm going to have some fun ! - It 's a joke ! - Who were we supposed to meet exactly ? According to the anonymous tip ... the Saviour ! Over here , go upstairs ! Relax , Miss . You 're safe here . I gave you some tranquilizers . I 'd like to find the origin of your trauma . It 's important . Try to remember . I can 't remember anything . I don 't know . You were alone on a railroad track when the police found you . And you were wearing these clothes . I can 't remember . Try again . It 's important Where did you come from ? With which company ? What were you doing ? The swamps ! The operation ! The Dr ! It was awful ! Draw them . Draw what 's in your mind . Interesting . The swamps , you said ? Caporal Boorman , you 're an ace and an excellent tracker . Bring me those very sympathetic creatures . They could be very useful to me . Hey , I got a scoop ! - Another story about the Saviour ? - This time I have snapshots . - Let me see . I never had so much work . Look at this list . How can I put them all in my column ? Everybody 's dying in this area . That 's a real problem for me . Gee ! The Saviour would be real then ? I don 't understand what 's happening in this city but we got to get the exclusive on all that stuff ! The creatures have been seen in this perimeter . Let 's be careful . Listen ! The frogs stopped their singing ! The creatures went this way . Look down ! Footprints . It 's them alright . They 're nearby . I feel them . You go this way . Shit ! What kind of monsters are they ? Shit ! Fuck ! Those bastards got him ! - It 's too dangerous . Dr Kill sends us to death . - Yes but we 're well paid . - It 's a suicide ! - Yes , but it 's a well paid suicide ! It burns ! Take these gloves . I must be dreaming ! " A mad criminal wants to rule the world ! " Me , crazy ? She will pay ! They will all pay for this ! My name is Isabelle . I 'm 21 . I practice volley-ball . My hobbies are drawing and reading . It 's an honor for me to represent West News in the 1993 Miss Local Press Competition . Our Editor is rejoicing . Good for him . That kind of competion get on my nerves . It 's only good for poodles . My name is Graziella , I 'm 22 . I like movies , business management and horse-riding . And here 's our last candidate . With such lovely girls our triumph is assured at the 1993 Local Press Convention . I won 't hold you longer because I know you came to see our candidates but also to have a drink . Bar is open ! Wrong ! It 's just been closed ! Ladies and Gentlemen , do not panic ! If you do what you 're told , almost no harm will be done to you ! But allow me to introduce myself , Dr Kill , the Killer for friends ! But some of you may have already heard of me if they read that awful article published recently by your crummy paper ! What do you want , in the end ? Excuse-me for barging in your nice little gathering but I 've always been like that . I want to be the star of the show ! Bloody rats ! But where is the naughty girl who pumped that very bad article on Dr Kill ? - What can we do ? - First , to stay out of their hands . - He surely did not like that article . - I think so . The gathering has started ? I 'm a bit late . Stay here . I 'll try to get some help . If the Saviour did know about the situation . He certainly could save us . Maybe . You ! Come back ! Hello ? You hear me , Killerman ? I 'm the Saviour . That good old buddy ! Bring me that shoddy super-hero . You know , Ladies and Gentlemen , science is a playing game . Me , I 'm playing with my female patients . And the Saviour is playing with my men . But I don 't like to lend my toys for too long . You know that , Boris . Come on , let 's finish the game with the Saviour ! What now , a timing problem ? In fact , we have troubles catching him , Dr Kill . I see that the Saviour is like me . He loves playing with toy soldiers . Nobody upstairs . But then ? To the cellar ! You , take a look over there . Stay here , I 'll take a look . You won 't catch Helena . But I 'll catch you . You 're done , Dr Kill . I knocked-out all your men . It would be wise , I think , to go back to our laboratory . With this specimen ! Come here ! It looks like the map of a secret lair . There 's no time to lose . My good old reporter 's outfit ! It 's been a long time since something interesting happened in this damn city ! To me the scoop ! To me the glory ! With such a scoop , the Gulf war can be displaced to the news item . You 're gonna come with us quietly , dear Sir . Go on ! Go on ! But I think I recognize the fantastic Editor of the famous West News daily ! I was passing there hapazourdly . I was picking up mushrooms . You were picking up mushrooms in those stinky swamps ? What do you want from me ? I 'd just like some information , my good Sir . What do you know exactly about the Saviour ? That grotesque super-hero who annoys me so much . I know nothing . Think about what I could give you . I 'm a master at the art of manipulating young women 's minds . Isn 't there in your staff a young woman named Helena ? Think that by a simple twist of my lancet I could made her madly in love with you ! You could really do it ? Where is the Saviour ? It 's a deal . The Saviour is around the place . He 'll be here in a few minutes . You 're very kind ! Well ! We don 't have much time left to arrange the welcome commitee for our friend the Saviour . Come here , hoodlums ! I 'm waiting for you ! Go up there and bring me back this wall crawler ! I never liked Spider-man ! It 's the Saviour ! Dr Kill wants him alive ! It 's not that easy ! Could this man be invincible ? Dr Kill , where are you ? Hello , dear Saviour ! Nice of you to join us to our little party ! We 're celebrating my 25th operation ! Welcome Saviour , it 's gonna be your party too ! So long , Saviour ! Who turned off the light ? Quick , my infrared glasses ! Up your hands ! I 'm sorry , Miss , but it 's gonna be a little bit difficult . Take Boris , for example . He 's one-armed . How do you want him to raise both hands ? But maybe he will manage to force you to raise yours ! Quick ! Send the sleeping gas ! To the bed , my children ! The party is over ! My good friends , I ' m sure you never tried a parachute jump without a parachute ! You 'll see , it 's very funny ! He 's escaping ! Get him back ! Come quick ! Where are you going ? I 'll try to follow him ! The Saviour is behind us ! He 's getting nearer ! He 's getting nearer ! - We have a gas leak ! - A gas leak ? We 're forced to land near the quarries . Then , how was your date with the boss ? Don 't ask ! What a boor ! Having sex to get a promotion , it only works in the movies . And not every time . Captain , I don 't understand why we did not send one of our teams to capture the E.T.s. The media will learn about them and then the population . You didn 't read the local press ? All the crimes committed by the specimens SK01 and SK02 have been attributed to a para-military group managed by a sort of mad scientist . Another wanna-be ruler of the world . Yes and it 's very convenient for our business . That 's it ! Punch him ! Harder ! What a puny man , that Lieutnant ! Saviour ! It could have been a disaster for us . She 's really nervous these days . Oh you know , women ... Just don 't care . Tell me more on the rumour about the masked super-hero , that do-gooder from St Maxime . According our reports , it 's an unfounded rumour . A pure local urban myth . They 're just peons ! It 's better for us then . There 's something else . The lab recorded new cosmic disturbances . We must be prepared for the arrival of other E.T.s. All our services must be on red alert . I 'm reminding you that the National Defence and Security ministers asked us not to use the creatures as military weapons . It 's too dangerous . They just want us to get rid of the specimens as discretly as possible . And if they could not be destroyed ? They are uncontrollable killing-machines . They don 't react like human beings . If we had them in Algeria , we would have send them on the rebels . Today , we could send a few of them to Sadam Hussein , to clean up the country . If those fools are not interested , I am . I will find a way to use them . Is that clear ? At your disposal , Captain . It 's true this time ? You 'll give up your super-hero job to take care of me ? I 've finished my job . Good vanquished evil in this city . So long , old dirty pants . Look ! I think it could still be useful . Captain , don 't you think this case looks like a b-movie . Not at all . If we were in a b-movie , the hero would uncover us , would call us " dirty bastards " and would punch our noses . And we would end up in jail with Inspector Tardieu . We 're on the good side , in the reality . We must take advantage of it and grab more strength , money and POWER ! What then , Captain , if we were in a z-movie ? If I got you clear , I was working for the government in a special corp . You 're still working for them . Your mission started two months ago . There 's a leak in the Roboflash program . A reporter has threatened to make a public announcement live on TV . I 'm just a glass-cleaner , a simple glass-cleaner . He must not make this announcement . It 's the summer holidays soon . I don 't think people would be very enthusiastic about a third world war ! You 'll go to this man 's place . He is too much interested in you . He 's got to be terminated . I know you 're planning total world war . I have proofs , the Roboflash program , for instance . Too bad you 're only a Robot !

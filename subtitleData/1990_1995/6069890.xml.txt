[ theme music ] [ music continues ] ( man on radio ) Good morning , Capital City Lex Luthor comin ' at you with a big surprise . Oh , swell . Cancel the life insurance folks cause in six hours you 're all gonna be dead . That 's right six . Count ' em six hours . You see your Uncle Lex just put the finishing touches on a nationwide network of nuclear devices as they say in the bomb biz . So big , so powerful makes the pentagon warhead look like a cherry bomb . And guess what folks . I 'm gonna set the first one off right here in Capital City ! Bing , bang , boom in the blink of an eye , you 're all going to be nuclear waste . [ whistle blowing ] But not just you , friends and neighbors . No , no , no .

And exterminate all life on planet earth . Get the picture ? Enjoy your final hours . I know I will . [ honking ] ( female # 1 ) Lex . You forgot to tell them what you want . What ? - Your demands . - Demands ? You know , what they have to do so you won 't set off the bombs . Don 't have any demands . Just gonna do it . Wake up and smell the coffee , babe . This is the last day of the rest of your life . [ laughing ] [ intense music ] [ rumbling ] [ rumbling ] [ music intensifies ] So are you gonna help me down or what ? Thanks . Any sign of Luthor ? Looks like Luthor hasn 't been here for months . You shouldn 't have followed me here . Look , if the world 's gonna end in a few hours I wanna be with you when we go . The world isn 't going to end . It 's like doomsday out there already . Street 's are clogged with cars people are crawling all over each other just to get out before the bomb hits . - If Luthor does as he says .. - Look , I know Luthor is sick . But I don 't think he is capable of doing something like this . Can we have really know what another person is capable of ? Look . The life and times of Lex Luthor . It 's a computer disc . Well , let 's see . " 21-J-L-L . " Got it . Project Genesis progress report . Phase one complete . All of Luthor 's memories have been transferred to psycho disc . Phase two after numerous attempts remains a failure . The project however will continue until- - This disc contains Luthor 's memories . And that must be the playback device . What are you doing ? Remember what you said ? That none of us can never know exactly what another person is truly capable off . This could tell us . It could be a trap . Knowing Luthor , probably it is a trap . It 'll be alright . Worked like a charm . He followed the radio waves I deflected right to my other lab . Precious time lost , Superboy . You 're never gonna find me now . - Lex , you 're not really gonna- - - Bingo . He 's activated the psycho disc . What 's a psycho disc ? Why are you forever asking questions you could not possibly understand the answers to ? [ beeping ] [ laughing ] Lex . Lex . Come on , Lex . Dinner 's on the table . You know how mad dad get 's when you 're late . Lex ? But I 'm not .. The machine . I must be living Luthor 's memories . Come on ! [ intense music ] You 're late genius . What 's the matter ? They 're keeping you after school so they can give you more tests ? Tests ? They 're not giving him any more tests . Isn 't that right ? They say you 're just a normal kid . Like everyone else . Still in grammar school and already you think you 're better than everybody . Well , you 're not . - You 're just a dummy . - Don 't say that . Lex 'll go to college . He 'll make a- - Shut up ! You think some magic pills will make everything better ? - Huh ? - No . You think he 's your ticket outta here ? Just ' cause those big shots say you 're so smart don 't make you better than your ol ' man . Hear me ? Lex never said he was better- - - I 'm not talking to you , Lena . - Leave her alone ! You want her beating ? Fine . [ music intensifies ] [ laughing ] [ beeping ] Just three and a half hours to bing , bang , boom boys and babes . So you better say your prayers cause time 's are wasting ' . Come on , Lex . Level with me . When are you gonna ask ' em for the money ? Money ? Is that all you can think about when , what is money ? Some kinda of magic pill that cures everything ? Well , then what is it ? Superboy ? You want ' em to give you Superboy . I 've already got Superboy . If something goes wrong , is there a way to get him back ? Access denied . We 'll just see about that . Let them think I 'm stupid . That 's just the way I want it . Remember that time I figured out pie to the last digit ? No one else in the world could do it , but I did it . Then I erased it before those big shot experts could see it . I don 't have to prove anything to them . But one day .. One day , you 'll invent all kinds of wonderful things . And you 'll make a million dollars . Isn 't that what you always told me ? That we 'll have lots of money , and then it 'll be alright . And then we 'll be happy . And then we 'll be together . Just the two of us . Nobody else . And we 'll be happy . [ dramatic music ] Did he hit you again ? - It 's okay . - No , it 's not ! One day , I 'll be big enough and- - ( male # 1 ) Hey , shut up in there ! [ music intensifies ] - You guys talkin ' about me ? - No . Always talkin ' about me , aren 't ya ? Huh ? ( male # 1 ) Told you once , I 've told you a thousand times don 't talk about me , boy ! You hear me ? [ beeping ] Superboy ? Oh , my God . [ buzzing ] Lena . Lena . Your injuries are minor . The electronic field is for protection not harm . How do I turn off that machine ? Access denied . Why the hell did Luthor create this thing anyway ? The psycho disk was created to transfer Luthor 's consciousness to an android host . So , that 's phase two ? But he 's not an android . Then , there will be no transfer of consciousness . However if disconnect is not achieved in ten minutes the subject will have absorbed all the information on the disk . Which means ? He will be trapped , forever . In a loop of Luthor 's memories . How do I turn it off ? Come on ! How do I break the link ? Access denied . Warning , you are at risk . There is no guarantee that you will re-emerge from Luthor 's memories . Shut up . [ laughing ] You 're not gonna do this . Say you 're not gonna do this . Okay . You 're not gonna do this . What 's the matter with you ? I 've never seen you like this before . Oh , Darla , Darla , Darla . You 've never seen me , period . You don 't know me . - You never have . - What 're you talking about ? Of course , I know you . I 'm your girl . You 're a joke . You 're just a reminder of all the walking mannequins I 've had to put up with my entire life . Don 't say that . I know that you love me . I know that you 're just making all this up . There 's only one person on the face of the planet I 've ever loved . She died last week . [ dramatic music ] Lena . Why didn 't you do something ? Why don 't you do something ? You stupid cow ! I 've had enough of this . I 've had enough ! Superboy . Lex ? Are you okay ? [ laughing ] Working on another one of your experiments ? It 's nothing important . Do me a favor . Don 't stay home tonight . - What ? - Stay at Susan 's , go anywhere . But promise me , you won 't stay home tonight . - But daddy won 't let me . - Don 't worry about daddy . - But- - - Don 't worry about daddy . Okay . Still stuck in there as planned . You pathetic moron . You know , the real beauty of this is even Superboy ain 't gonna survive my little holocaust . It 's poetic . When he dies , his final thoughts will quite literally be of me . Oh , my , my , my . Look at the time . Better arm the warhead . Lex , you 're really gonna do this ? Haven 't you been paying attention ? - Yeah , but all those people . - Are morons , idiots , creeps . They deserve to die . Um , after the bomb , you and me we 'll be the only ones left ? My darling , this is ground zero . We 'll be the first to go . Incinerated in a wink of an eye . Fini , kaput , bye bye , all gone . Well , you 'll be gone . I ... will live on . After a fashion . My exact duplicate . My crowning achievement . He can do what even Superboy can 't . Survive . All my memories , all my thoughts all my feelings , all that I am will live on in him . ( Darla ) Can you do that for me ? I could , but I won 't . My partnership in eternity is reserved for .. ... my little Lena . She 's not exactly your type . She 's my sister , you cow ! She 's programmed with everything I remember of Lena . Everything we shared . She 's so ... angelic . We 'll live happily ever after . Together , just the two of us . For all of eternity . You better let us go or I 'm gonna , I 'll kick your butt , boy . - Oh , no . You won 't . - Yes , I will . Not ever again . We 'll see about that . Lena is the only decent thing I 've got . And it 's about time I gave her a good life . Free from you two . See , once I flip this little switch it engages the timer . And three minutes later , bing , bang , boom . The whole house goes out . I really should thank you for the money . What money ? From the life insurance policy I took out on you two . It 's really gonna be terrific for the two us . I mean , it should get us out of this rat hole of a neighborhood . And set me safely on the road to power . How could you do this ? After everything I 've done for you . Everything I 've given you . C 'est la vie . That 's French . In case you didn 't know . - Son . - I 'm no son of yours . Superboy , don 't do it . You 're not a killer . You 're not Lex . ( Holographic Lex ) Warning , one minute to complete psycho meld . Memory loop closing rapidly . Warning , memory loop closing . Lex , honey . You can 't do this to me . After all that I 've done for you . All that I 've given you . ( Computer ) Detonation in one hour , twenty minutes . C 'est la vie . That 's French . In case you didn 't know .

 Oh , my ... God ! That was ... That was incredible ! I mean it . You don 't believe me . Can you hear me ? Hey , I don 't even know your name . Man calls his wife to say good night , goes out , meets a chippy , brings her here for sex . - Beyond that , nothing makes a lot of sense . - How 's that ? Security monitor records the victim entering the room with a woman at 10.13 . Same monitor records a male leaving after midnight . Couldn 't she have changed clothes ? Male is definitely a different person . Short hair and at least 30Ibs heavier . The video never recorded his entry , nor the chippy ever leaving . 30 floors up . No other means of egress . - Did the doctor establish a cause of death ? - Guy blew an artery . Must have been some roll in the hay ! Hard to imagine , this day and age , someone having sex with a stranger . Any sign of robbery ? The male exited wearing the victim 's suit , carrying a suitcase . Wallet 's gone . I don 't know why we got this call in the first place . Really ? Somebody at the Bureau put out a request for any case involving this COD . - I assumed it was ... - Thanks for the call . Five deaths . Four in the last six weeks between here and Boston . In each case the victim dies in the throes of passion . Two women and three men , including the last one . - All young , healthy adults . - With symptoms of massive coronary arrest . - Is there a new drug on the streets ? - The oldest drug . Not even illegal . Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones . The chemicals animals secrete ? You mean sexual attractants ? Radar love , only 100 times stronger than found in nature . Strong enough to produce anaphylactic shock or a coronary . So you think somebody 's synthesising them ? It 's been done , but not in such concentrations . And hold on to your hat , Scully , cos you 're gonna love this . The pheromones we 're talking about contain human DNA . There 's still a question as to whether humans can produce pheromones , so how can that be ? I don 't know , but if it 's true this guy 's a walking aphrodisiac . He 's the ultimate sex magnet . He or she ? You 've got victims of both sexes . Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor . - I know . That is a puzzle . - So what is our profile of the killer ? Indeterminate height , weight and sex . Unarmed , but extremely attractive . It gets weirder . As I said , four deaths have matched this MO in the last six weeks . In Boston , Hartford , Philadelphia , and here in Washington . The killer 's moving south . There was a death I made a note of a year ago with the same symptoms . A 32-year-old UMW labour organiser was found dead outside the town of Steveston , in the woods of Massachusetts . Home to a sect of religious isolationists called the Kindred . Right . They live up there without electricity , phones . A lot like the Amish . The Kindred are known for their handmade pottery . They mine the clay in the local hills . What 's so weird about that ? The white clay in those hills is particular to that region . It 's also the same substance I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim 's side . Wait a minute . Aren 't these people famous for their abstinence and pure Christian ways ? Yes , but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to clean under his fingernails . Hi . Ma 'am . This is Agent Scully . I 'm Agent Mulder . - We 're investigating a possible murder . - Well , there aren 't many killings around here . What can you tell me about the Kindred ? They keep pretty much to themselves , huh ? Yeah , some folks say it 's cos they do ceremonies up there . Voodoo or something . I 've got nothing against them . They bring in tourists . - Did they let you take those pictures ? - Those are from the ' 30s . - And the missing ones ? - Having them reframed . They 're under here . - Can I take a look at ' em ? - Sure . - How would I get up to see them ? - They don 't like strangers up there much . Road 's in pretty rough shape . There 's Steveston . That 's them now . They usually shop at the feed store . Whoa , boy . Excuse me ... Ladies ? I think I 'm gonna go inside . Need anything from the feed store ? Hi . She must have problems on the asphalt . Has she ever thrown a shoe ? What 's her name ? Alice . That 's sweet . Did you name her ? We named her all together . I 'm not allowed to talk outside . It 's all right . I 'm Dana Scully . I don 't mean you any harm . Brother Andrew . What are you doing ? I was just talking . - You all right ? - Yeah , I think so . You wanna sit down ? Interesting way of life . Get any sense about ' em ? - There 's something up there , Mulder . - I 've been saying that for years . Oh , for a four-wheel drive . Looks like about a mile ... walk . After you . Now , this ... That 's west . What does the map say ? That we should be there already . Mulder , look . We 're FBI agents ! Federal police ! I 'm Agent Mulder . This is Agent Scully . We 're here to investigate a murder . I 'm gonna have to ask you to remain at a distance , please , sir . Your weapons are forbidden here . We can outlast you at this spot . You 're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed to our council . You will have them again as you leave . - We can 't do that . - Please ! I 'm Sister Abbey . This is Brother Oakley . We 're all saddened by what has happened in your world , but it does not concern us . Up here , no one kills another ... ever . We just want a few questions answered . Your weapons are unwelcome here , not you . Come and pray with us , be one of us . You 'll see we harm no one . Please relinquish your weapons . Please . Now there is no reason to be afraid . Come . Sit . Let us pray as one . We who are separate give thanks for our allotted time in this world . We ask for strength that we may bring forth the bounty that God has provided . Amen . We pray for the day of the coming - the moment of our release . Amen . Let us eat . Could we ask a few questions ? We 're looking for someone who may have come from here . - We have pictures . - We do not allow pictures . A crime has been committed . We have certain questions we need answered , if you 'll forgive us . What are these pictures ? Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have committed a murder . - Where was this crime committed ? - In a hotel in Washington DC . If we can arrange for you to look at the video tape , maybe you can identify the individual . How much violence has this person caused in your world ? Five murders so far . And may kill again , which is why we need your help . Has anyone left recently ? Your world does not interest us ! We have no need for your violence or your questions ! I 've said what is needed . They have no right to be here at this time . Brother Wilton , stand . Before we can accept any man 's person , we must accept our own . And I ask who can stand in your sight when once you are angry ? I am ashamed to lift up my face . And I shall not be ashamed in this evil time . Make atonements for this wrath , Brother Wilton . - That 's all right , we didn 't take any offence . - Anger , as violence , is not tolerated . He must be admonished . - He can 't breathe . - He does not need your help . He 's choking to death ! Remove Brother Aaron from the dining hall . We did not invite you here to interfere . We take care of our own . - Would you like to dance ? - Not right now . Look , I 'm really not interested . OK ? Just one dance . Yeah . One dance . It 's a mile to your car . Stay on the path . Thanks for your cooperation . The Addams Family finds religion . Take me back to the 20th century . - You believe all that back there ? - Believe all what ? All that " we take care of our own " business ? They better take care of their own or that man 's a dead man . - I think it was all an elaborate act . - What , the choking ? No , this simple life , living from abundance crap . These people know something , Scully . You can see it in their eyes . - You think they know the murderer ? - They didn 't answer one question of ours . That outburst at the table was on cue . Somehow they got us to answer their questions . - Did you ask yourself why no children ? - That was odd . Wanna know what 's really odd ? You know those pictures we saw at the store in Steveston today ? The ones from the ' 30s ? I swear I saw some of those same faces at the table tonight . They 've probably been intermarrying for years . Maybe . Maybe not everything is as black and white as it appears to be . - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna go back for a little look-see . Maybe they went to the movies . You hear that ? What do you think ? I think I wanna see what 's in that cellar . Come with me . I can give you information . - I know who did it . - The murders ? You 've heard our prayers . You 've seen how we live our beliefs . I want you to find this killer . I want you to find him for me . He was my best friend . - What 's his name ? - Brother Martin . I called him Marty . Marty was different . What do you mean , " different " ? How does he kill ? We 're not sure . All of the victims died of cardiac arrest . - He poisons them , doesn 't he ? - Maybe . How do you know that ? I need to show you something . Something about Marty . We found them out on Route 44 . We were wandering . Marty and I used to do that - explore the edges of our world . Somebody must have left them for garbage . They are garbage . - Why did you keep them ? - It was Martin who kept them . Some of what I saw in the magazines , some of it was beautiful , but most of it I didn 't like . It was garish . But Martin ... Marty couldn 't get enough . He liked even the paper it was printed on . Slick . Marty was captured by your world . He left us to become one of you . Brother Wilton , the woman 's returned . - Where is she ? - With Andrew in the main house . - What about the other one ? - He 's missing . You said Marty was different . Yes . - How ? I mean , how did he kill his victims ? - I could be banished . Does it have something to do with the ceremony tonight ? What are you doing ? Scully ! Marty is different . We 're all different . No ... Scully ! Get off of her ! I asked you not to interfere . - What the hell were you doing back there ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know ? ! - No . You all right ? I wasn 't ignoring you . No . Of course I saw you , I just ... didn 't recognise you . That 's all . Excuse me . I 'm on a conversation . - How you feeling ? - Better . A little embarrassed , actually . Why ? You don 't remember any of it . It 's like I don 't remember ... - Why didn 't you get out before he ... - He said he knew who the killer was . How did you know he wasn 't the killer ? I believed him . So , what did you see down in the cellar ? Just Brother Whatshisname buried in a gopher hole in the wall . Buried alive ! How do you know he was alive ? Because I was in there with him and his face was ... different . Even his hair was almost feminine . It was like he was going through a transformation . - Changing sexes ? - That would explain the hotel security video . So you 're saying these people ... I know what I saw , Scully . And I saw you about to do the " wild thing " with a stranger . Think he was trying to kill me ? Maybe it 's the sex that kills . Well , if he was trying to kill me , why did they let us go ? I don 't know . All right , let 's break it up . Outta the car . Sorry , Officer . You , too . - You a pro ? - Pro ? Wha ... On a scale of one to ten she was a " kind three " , but there was something about her . Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other manner ? Her touch was electric , but after that I remember ... only vaguely . - What do you remember ? - Nothing , actually . Try to remember , Michel . The policeman supports what you said , but maybe there was something ... unusual about this woman . Something you 'd feel uncomfortable telling the police on the record . - But this is off the record ? - Yes . What did you see , Michel ? After she left the car and fought with the cop , I saw her in her clothes and she looked like ... she looked like a man ! She was a man ? The club scene used to be so simple . It 's off the record ? Scout 's honour . One can 't rule out the possibility we 're looking for a transvestite . I think Don Juan knows the difference between males and females . I don 't want us to ignore the obvious . How else could you explain a woman overpowering a 200Ib cop ? She was a he . Agent Mulder , Agent Scully , the credit card stolen from the last victim was just used to order takeout in a hotel downtown eight blocks from here . It was always forbidden , but after the first time I couldn 't help myself . Touching a human man , or a woman , is as powerful for me as it was for you . This is Agent Scully requesting police backup at 771 Catherine Street . It 's the Hotel Catherine . Your world offers pleasures . Pleasures we don 't know because we 're different . But you know that now . The others will punish me for what I 've done . They 'll find me because the day is coming and they won 't leave without me . Mulder ! Delivery . FBI ! FBI ! Clear ! Stay down ! Dead body ! Scully ? I 'm OK . Scully , down the stairs . Federal agent . I 'm armed ! Back away ! Step away ! Step away ! Please ... don 't hurt him . No . Step away . I 'm armed . Scully ! The surrounding ten blocks have been secured for the past hour . We set up roadblocks on all routes out to Steveston . So far nothing , no reports of them . There 's no way they could get through . What if they did get through ? There 's only one place they 'd hide . They 're gone . We found something in the hayfield . I don 't understand . How can they disappear ? They have no means of transportation . No earthly means of transportation . Visiontext Subtitles by Natasha Cohn I made this ! ENGLISH

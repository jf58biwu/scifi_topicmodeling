 Ladies and gentlemen ... our national anthem . I 'm up . The ozone hole over the North Sector ... is now at 5,000 miles and growing . Good luck . Yes ? We are here to speak with Dr. Von Mobil . About what ? We 're from the Ministry of Knowledge . Knowledge ... Dr. Von Mobil , how are you feeling , sir ? Wonderful . We need to ask you a few questions . You want to know ... what I have ... up here . Nurse . Thank you . Sir , you must help us . Our research has shown only you are old enough to recall ... life here before the magnetic storm degaussed all recorded history . We need to rebuild , but before we can do so ... we need to know where we went wrong . You must ... rebuild . We know that , sir , but where do we begin ? " ' Four score and seven years ago ... " ' our forefathers ... " ' Yes ? Our forefathers . Tell us about our forefathers . The Constitution . The Declaration of Independence . Can you remember them ? " ' We the People ... " ' have a right to remain silent . " ' Anything you say may be used ... " ' against you . " ' One nation ... " ' invisible ... " ' with liberty ... " ' and Christmas for all . " ' Liberty ? What is liberty ? Freedom . What is freedom-dom ? The Fourth of July . What is the Fourth of July ? The day it all began . Seventeen ... 1776 . The day what began ? The birth ... of the nation . The Spirit ... of Seventy ... six . Dust growth has tripled in the outer regions . Evacuation needed . Repeat , evacuation needed . Adam-11 ? Isn 't it a little late for decorum , gentlemen ? We 're from the Ministry of Knowledge . I always wondered what you guys looked like . I 'm Chevron-17 . This is Yale-44 , Rons 29 through 31 ... and of course from the Sector of Psycho-Historical Inquiries , Heinz-57 . Hello , Adam-11 . Heinz-57 . Yeah . So what do you want ? According to the Ministry , two years ago ... you started filing requests for tetrahydrozoline-6 ... the main component of the Tetra-cell to fuel the ship you 've been working on . I know what it 's used for . Adam-11 , the Ministry has decided to grant your request . That 's great . That 's just wonderful . Ikiki Beach . Finally , I can go to paradise . There 's only one thing we need you to do for us . Chanel-6 , our foremost epistemological anthro-sociologist ... has redlined an outline for a mission back in time . We want you to pilot that mission . Just out of curiosity , how far back are we talking about ? 1776 . To the birth of our nation . I 'm not sure the ship would make it that far back . What better time to find out ? Find out ? Why would I want to risk my life for this mission ? You 'd go down in history as a hero . I 'm not the hero type , and in case you haven 't noticed , history is over . Not if we can save it . I 'm not interested in saving anything . All I wanted was the tetrahydrozoline . If you think you can bribe me by holding this over my head ... I 'm afraid my answer will have to be ... I 'm sorry I 'm late , everyone . I was held up at High Command . So now , Chevron , how many people are going to be in this crew ? Three brave souls ... Adam-11 , Chanel-6 , Heinz-57 ... now board the craft . Due to the molecular gravitational shift and planetary alignment ... they have only 12 hours or they will be lost ... never able to reenter the present . On this historic day , we wish our time travelers the best of luck ... and hope that the past they discover ... will be the key which will unlock our future . You look very stellar , Chanel . There 's the date , 21 ... Can 't you work out here ? Don 't worry , Chanel . Whatever happens , remember we only have 12 hours . Well , this is it . I can 't believe this is actually working . Baby , you ain 't seen nothing yet . Looks like we made it . Look at this . It 's amazing . Nature . I 've heard of this . So ... still think this pile of junk is useless ? Do you mean that rhetorically , or is this more idle flirtation ? I brought us to the birth of the nation . The least you could say is thank you . All right , Adam-11 . A job well done . Did you see the tubetop Cheryl Dickman had on today ? Boner city ! You could see the whole outline and everything . - Definite beat-off material . - Totally . Whoa , man ! What is that ? I don 't know . Maybe it 's a new sculpture or something . Looks more like a pile of junk . Let 's check it out . I 'm into it . Let 's go . - Chris . - Yeah ? Did I take any ' shrooms today ? Not to my knowledge . What the hell is this ? I don 't know . Why don 't we ask them ? Good idea . Why don 't you go ahead ? Only two wheels . Curious design . What are those ? Banana Chopper Fours with quarter spokes and full knobbies . What 's this ? Can we trust you ? Totally . - This was our transportation here . - Transportation ? We are from the year 2176 . Right . Now I get it . These guys are definitely frying on acid . - Probably still stuck in the ' 60s . - Woodstock city . Is this your communal hang-out or something ? Heinz-57 . Chanel-6 . I 'm Adam-11 . I 'm Tommy Sears . I 'm 17 . Chris Johnson . 18 . Oh , shit ! Snodgrass ! If it isn 't Rodney Snodgrass . I have been waiting for this my whole life . How long have you boneheads been here ? Just a few minutes . - Who are they ? - What 's it to you ? God ! You 're so stupid ! Didn 't you hear that noise ? Don 't you know anything about UFOs ? Wait a second . You think this is a UFO ? Wait till I tell my brother . Looks like I 've got the science fair prize wrapped up again this year . Thank you very much . - I 'd like to wrap him up . - Wait here until I get back . I 'm going to get some help . If they try to leave , just stall them ! Who was that ? - Rodney Snodgrass . - Science whiz , UFO buff . - All around pain in the ass know-it-all . - Enemy of decent people everywhere . - Enemy ? - It 's not too cool for you guys to be here . Do you know where we can hide ? Chris , aren 't those your consumer-minded parents ? Looks like they bought another car . Look , honey . It 's the boys ! We 're busted , dude . Quick , hide . I 'll handle this . Behind the ship . Hide , dude . - Hello , Tommy . - Hello , Mr. And Mrs. Johnson . Tommy , please , call us Bob and Jean . Okay , Jean . - Hi , Son . - Hi , Dad . Look what your mother and I just bought . Isn 't it a beauty ? Sure is wide . - Son , you know how I got this car ? - How , Dad ? By believing in myself . That 's great , Dad . I wish you 'd let me take you to one of the " ' Be " ' seminars , just once . No , thanks , Dad . With homework and summer school ... Son , I 'm not going to force you . It 's certainly not about that . Thanks , Dad . Well , we have to run . We don 't want to be late for the seminar . I don 't believe it . They didn 't say anything about the ship . My parents are so insane . Watch this . Mom , Dad ! Yes , Chris ? Is it okay if I keep this UFO in the garage for a while ? Anything you want , Son . God , I wish I had your parents , man . One and Two , come in . Please report to Liberty Park to investigate possible UFO sighted by ... ground central at quadrant four , vector L-7 R-6 . Over . Eddie , you 're not going to believe this . You drag me all the way out here to show me dirt ? I thought you said there was a chick . Somebody moved it ! You got to stop reading all those crazy magazines . You 're losing your mind . It was right here , I swear it ! - See what I see ? - I think so . - What do you see ? - A guy . That 's what I see . Hey , Eddie , wait ! Let 's check it out . Cool , huh ? Do you know these people ? - Man , I wish . - Who are they ? Mel Schacher , Don Brewer , and Mark Farner . Grand Funk Railroad . They are like " ' the " ' American band . - " ' The " ' American band ? - Shit , yeah . They like , " ' Come into your town and help you party down . " ' " ' Help you party down . " ' Totally . Haven 't you ever seen an 8-track player before ? Don 't they have those in the future ? You still don 't believe us ? No . Then why are you helping us ? I would do anything in this world just for once to see ... Rodney Snodgrass not get what he wants . - And he wants you . - And the science fair prize money . - Prize money ? - Yeah . It 's like $ 300 this year . $ 300 ? Is that a lot ? Dude ! Are you shitting us ? No . Look . There must be thousands of dollars here ! Where we come from , money is worthless . Inflation city . You guys really aren 't from around here , are you ? - It figures Rodney know-it-all was right . - The shit . - Open up , you guys ! - We 're busted . I know you 're in there ! It 's cool . I 'll handle this . I heard you playing Grand Funk . Open up or I 'll call the cops ! All right , what did you do with it ? - Do with what ? - You know with what . The UFO . There 's no such thing as UFOs . What do you think was in the park , genius ? Haven 't you ever heard of a public sculpture before ? Look , Johnson , if you 'd help me out ... I 'd be willing to cut you and Sears in on the science fair prize money . Blow butt , Snodgrass . Fine ! I don 't need your help ! I have all the proof I need right here ! See you around , sucker ! Up your nose with a rubber hose ! Listen up . If I know Rodney , he 's going straight to the cops . You guys are going to be like suspect city . I suggest we get you guys some new threads immediately . Right on ! I have found some very interesting artifacts . Look at this . What is it ? It appears to be footwear . Can I help you with something , or something ? I was just looking at this . What sign are you ? My mood ring totally changed colors . Sign ? You know , of the zodiac . I bet you 're a Capricorn . Caps are always so forgetful . Capricorn . I knew it ! I 'm psychic . Not really . I can 't bend spoons , but I can usually tell signs . - Hi , Cheryl . - Oh , hi . I 'll see you later . Ciao . Ciao ? You know , we 're not here to make friends . Wow , you look great . Boner city . Thank you . You know , Chanel ... I 've been planning a little trip to a place called lkiki Beach . I thought after this little mission was over , you might want to join me . - " ' Little " ' mission ? - Relax . Relax ? You don 't seem to understand . This is no time to relax ! This " ' little " ' mission may just determine the future of this planet . - Come on , I didn 't mean anything ... - What are you here for , anyway ? That 's what I was saying . When I go back , they 'll give me enough tetrahydrozoline to go anywhere in time . - And I just ... - And that 's why you took this mission ? - Well , yeah . - Is that all you think about ? Yourself ? Don 't you care that our world is dying and that we have a chance to save it ? Of course I care . I was just thinking about after we save the world . Just try to blend in . Just be cool . - I think Heinz got the wrong size suit . - Yeah . It 's a little tight . You think that was them ? I don 't know . It didn 't look like them to me . - Maybe we should 've asked . - Asked what ? If it was them . - You think so ? - What ? That we should 've asked them . Headquarters , come in . This is One and Two requesting back-up at Taylor and Main . We think it 's them . - Rodney , where the hell are you ? - I 'm busy . - Hello ? - Yes , is your refrigerator running ? Why , yes , it is . Better go catch it ! What the hell did you do with my gold razor blade ? Goddamn it , Eddie , you idiot ! My evidence ! Sorry . Hope it wasn 't anything important . Thanks . The birth rate is now at 20 percent and falling . Hi . My name is Cyndi . And I 'll be your waitress on this very special Fourth of July . Heinz-57 . I can tell you 're ready to put in your special order . What can I get for you ? Cyndi , I 'm looking for the Constitution . - We just ran out of the Constitution . - Ran out ? I know , it 's terrible . But the Bill of Rights burger is just as good and comes with the salad bar . No , I must have the Constitution . Well , if you take the Valley Forge tuna melt ... and replace the dill spears with pickle relish , you 'll get pretty close . Valley Forge , barf city . Why don 't you think it over , talk amongst yourselves ... and I 'll be back in a little bit . Valley Forge . Barf city ? If you don 't mind my asking , what exactly is your mission ? We 've come here to retrieve the heritage of our nation . The Constitution . Are you for real ? You came all this way just for that ? Dude . - Do you know where can we find it ? - Any library . Excellent . I suggest we individuate and meet back at the ... Crash pad . Heinz , you get to the library and retrieve the documents . I 'll decode and collect all the aesthetic data . Adam-11 , you research the various technological ... Wait a second . Hold on . Since when are you giving the orders ? Adam-11 , this is no time for petty ego arguments . Since you 're here , you might as well help . I signed on to operate the craft . Saving the future was never really my interest in life . - It 's about time you made it your interest . - Calm down . And it 's time you stopped telling me what to do . Oh , brother . You 're either with us on this or you 're not . All right , the plan is clear . We all know what we have to do . Now let 's just ... do it . - That was expensive . - I know . I can 't wait until we go metric . Everything will be so much cheaper then . - Oh , man , cop city . - We 're busted . - Come on . - Let 's go ! Hold it right there ! - Where are you going , Adam ? - Run , Chanel . This way , come on . Excuse me , officers , could you direct me to the nearest Miller 's Outpost ? - Look , another streaker . - Nice butt . - Hold it ! - Freeze , right there ! Hey , mellow out . - You want to smoke some Lumbo ? - Lumbo ? It 's got a little paraquat in it , but that was two weeks ago . It should be all right by now . I mean , that stuff dissipates really fast . Can I help you ? I need some papers , man . I need about a case of rolling papers . And I want to look at some of these hash pipes , too . And I want to see that roach clip . I like that one with the feather on it . Hey . Check this out , man ! What is it ? It 's a bong , man . - Bong ? - Yeah . A Bicentennial bong . See , it 's got pictures of the Founding Fathers on it . The Founding Fathers ? Except the pictures should have been down here ... so you can check ' em out when you get wasted . The employment index ... is at minus 027 and falling . Hey , you in the orange suit . You lookin ' like a man of leisure . Come on over here a moment . I can 't . I 'm being pursued . You 're being pursued ? Let Clovis fix you up . I got a place where you can hide . Ask . Know Miss Liberty . - You know Thomas Jefferson ? - I know Luther Jefferson . Hi . I 'm lusty Miss Liberty , here to cater and fulfill your every desire . So what gets you off ? You see , I come from the future . Wait . Let me guess . Science fiction fantasy ? No , psycho-historical studies . I was on my way to the library in search of the Constitution ... Wait . Did you say the Constitution ? Yes . In the future , this document will be lost . I say it may as well be lost today . How do you mean ? Let 's take a look at the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution ... because , in a sense , that 's where it all starts . A lie from the President to manipulate Congress to fund an undeclared war ? Not only does this render the tripartite system functionally useless ... but clearly violates the oath of office prescribed by the Constitution itself . Amazing . So , listen , you want to get high ? I got my van parked out front and I got this killer sinsemilla . Yes , let 's get high . What 's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this ? I was just leaving . With this guy ? What gives ? Give it up , Snodgrass . Trojan ! The name is Eddie Trojan . But you , my dreambucket , can call me Eddie . You , my dreambucket , can call him dickhead . Later . How would you like to boogie down sometime ? - Boogie ? - You know , let loose . I 'm talking ... - I know I 'm good , but ... - Let 's leave . Whatever you say . Oh , shit . Here come the fuzz . So with Watergate we see the last nail ... driven into the coffin of the electoral process itself . You see , Heinz , how essential it is that this document be observed to the letter . - There he is ! - Hold it ! - Move around the front ! - Let 's go ! - Thank you , Clovis . - Right on . Come on ! That way . I know a shortcut . Is that the kind of car I think that is ? - But it didn 't even hit it . - Doesn 't have to . Let 's get out of here . Man , that was more cops than Starsky and Hutch ! I thought for sure we were busted ! Cop city ! Everyone , please take a seat . You 're just in time . You 're the last one we 're letting in . Please make yourself comfortable . We 're going to be here a while , okay ? Great . Super . First time ? Yes . This guy is going to blow your mind . The first time I was here , I shit in my pants ... and then got a raise the very next day . How does it feel ... to be ... an asshole ? How does that feel ? Because whether you know it or not ... you 're all assholes . Come on , say it with me . " ' I am an asshole ! " ' You 're not getting it . Say it loud . " ' I am an asshole ! " ' Good . Want to hear my new 8-track stereo ? It 's real bitchin ' . - You know , they call me the bonemaster . - Really ? I know I 'm hot stuff , but how come you 're so keen on seeing my pad ? Let 's just say you fascinate me , Eddie . Whatever . So this is where you live ? For now . This is just a temporary thing . Soon as I get my real estate license , I 'm outta here . Wanna go in your folks ' house and show Adam how to play Atari ? Tommy , in case you forgot , we totally agreed to help save the world . - What did Chanel want us to do ? - Gather the artifacts . Okay , cool . I 'm into it . Let 's do it . There 's one thing , though . What 's an artifact ? - Oh , man ! I thought that you knew ! - How am I supposed to know ? Adam , don 't think I 'm a dork , but what 's an artifact ? I don 't know . All this stuff . Like this . What is this ? - Tang ! - Tang ? It 's like orange juice , it 's sort of a breakfast drink . But you don 't have to drink it just for breakfast . It 's what the astronauts drink in space . - What do your astronauts do in space ? - All kinds of stuff . They put an American flag on the moon . Played golf and jumped around a lot . They did a lot of stuff for mankind . Really ? It didn 't work . Oh , no . The Tetra-cell is gone ! - The what ? - The battery ! Snodgrass ! The Lumis-Foil is starting to erode . Bummer . Nothing like eroded Lumis-Foil . - What 's Lumis-Foil ? - It protects the internal conduit controls . However , without the Tetra-cell , the Lumis-Foil will decay ... and the transfer of anti-matter through time will no longer be contingent ... Are we gonna be tested on this ? Really , dude , just speak English . It means we must get the Tetra-cell back . We have to find Snodgrass . Where is he ? The science lab ! Didn 't your mother teach you not to steal ? You guys should have shared with me . Then I wouldn 't have had to steal ! Excuse me , Mr. Kipper ! Toadblock ! - Make mine well done , honey . - Right up . That 's it , Billy , hit him hard . Let 's get him . Mind if I borrow this ? Cool ! Just like Snake Canyon ! Evil Kneviel ! - Wipe out ! - Come on . He 's getting away ! - Coming through ! - Drop dead , Rodney . What the hell are you doing ? Oh , man ! It 's gonna blow ! Isn 't that nice ? Now we boogie . I 've heard this before . Sure you have . It 's The Hustle . Would it be fair to say that a lot of people live like you do ? Hey , maybe a lot of people like me ... but there 's no one like me . Know what I 'm saying ? There 's only one Eddie Trojan . So what are we waiting for ? Let 's boogie . You 're an asshole . And you 're an asshole . Excuse me , sir . - Where do you think you 're going ? - I 'm sorry , but I have to leave . You have to leave ? That 's very interesting . Where do you have to leave to ? I must get to the library ... No , no ! You don 't have to get to the library . You want to get to the library . Do you see what I 'm getting at ? You see the difference ? I must leave . Buddy , you don 't understand . These seminars ... they 're about commitment . Now , if you get it , I 'd be happy to let you leave . But do you get it ? Get what ? What 's your name ? Heinz ... Heinz , for the remainder of this seminar ... you will be referred to as Heinz Asshole . Now , please , take a seat . Wonderful . Our time travelers have just under five hours left . We wish them luck . Thanks . We 'll need it . " ' Carbon dioxide . " ' No ! What are you trying to do , kill yourself ? Lethal combo . Ten kids already died with those things exploding in their stomachs . The carbonation triggers it off . - Then , kaboom ! - Explosion city ! Did you catch up with Snodgrass ? Okay . Good news and bad news . The good news is , we just saved your life , for which you should be eternally grateful . And the bad news ? The bad news concerns the Tetra-cell . It 's gone . - Gone ? What do you mean , gone ? - Well , it like totally exploded . I see . So , what you 're saying ... is that I 'm stuck here . Forever . Bummer . Really . Now you know how we feel . Why didn 't I listen to myself ? I knew from the start this mission thing was not a good idea . Then why did you do it ? Tommy , why does any man do what he does ? You 're getting it . That 's hot . Eddie , you won 't believe what happened to me . What do you want now , Rodney ? Eddie , that 's one of them . She 's one of them . - What are you talking about ? - When I took you to where they landed . She 's one of the crew that was standing by the ship . I thought I told you to forget about that stuff . There 's no telling what they might be up to . We have to call the CIA ! - You 're not calling the CIA . - Yes , I am ! Adam-11 to Chanel-6 . Come in , Chanel-6 . Chanel-6 . Go ahead , Adam-11 . Bum-out . The Tetra-cell has been stolen and destroyed . You might as well just take it easy . This mission is over . This mission is not over . You agreed to pilot us here and take us back . Not leave us stranded here in 1776 . I didn 't plan on having the Tetra-cell stolen , did I ? And I didn 't plan on having our pilot turn out to be a quitter . What 's all that noise ? Where are you ? If you must know , I am in the safe hands of Eddie Trojan . The bonemaster . And just what are you doing in his hands ? I 'm learning how to dance . Dancing ? Oh , that 's good . I can see how that 's going to save the future . Perhaps I should ask Eddie to build the Tetra-cell ... since you don 't seem to be up to the task . Alien or not , I got a good chance of getting a piece of ass here . You mess this one up and I 'll punch your lights out . You 're so stupid . It takes one to know one . - CIA ? - Yes . The suicide rate has just overtaken the birth rate . How can I get out of here ? I must leave . You can 't leave . It 's part of the process . Because when you get right down to it , when push comes to shove ... it 's about freedom . And when I talk about freedom ... I 'm not talking about the kind you get when you buy a box of maxi-pads . I 'm talking about freedom with a capital " ' F. " ' Freedom of choice . You want that raise with the $ 10,000 bonus ? - Sure . - Then , baby , goddamn it , you take it ... because it belongs to you . But don 't just dream it . Be it . Be . Say it with me . " ' Be . " ' Good . Can an artifact be food ? 'Cause I just totally raided my folks ' kitchen . Killer ! Let 's scarf . - You want a Snowball ? - No , thanks . Come on , lighten up . You 're bumming me out . Did you know that if I made it back ... they were going to give me all the tetrahydrozoline-6 I wanted ? - Tetra-what ? - Tetrahydrozoline-6 . What is it ? A very rare chemical that the government keeps under tight control . - I 've heard of that . - I doubt it very highly . No , really , I have . Tetrahydrozoline . I 've heard of that , too . Tetrahydrozoline , tetrahydrozoline ... Eye drops ! - Shit , man . That 's it ! - That 's what ? Dude , it 's eye cleaner stuff . It puts the white back in . A common household item . " ' Now with tetrahydrozoline . " ' " ' Available in econo-size . " ' You know how valuable this will be one day ? It 's valuable now , like when you don 't want your parents to know you 're stoned . - Can we get more of this ? - Shitloads . Unbelievable . Now all we need is some carbon dioxide to act as a catalyst . That may be a little more difficult . - Carbon city . - What ? It 's carbon dioxide ! In other words , we have the technology . We can rebuild it . One more thing . I don 't think the ship is safe here anymore . Snodgrass knows where it is . And God knows who he 's told by now . Where can we hide it ? Totally ! - Honey , isn 't that Chester McAndrew ? - Yes , it is . I think he won last year . Very bright boy . Very bright . Watch it , Johnson . You 'll scare my hamster ! - Well , don 't bogart the table . - Really . How 's the Lumis-Foil doing ? It 's definitely seen better days . We 'll have to work fast . Tommy , get the carbon dioxide . Chris , as much tetrahydrozoline as you can . Let 's book ! Eddie , I must go now . I wonder , could you give me a ride ... Hey , where 's the fire ? Get to know me . - Do you hear what I hear ? - I think so . What do you hear ? - A woman 's voice . - That 's what I hear . Eddie , what exactly are you doing ? Babe , I can 't help myself . When I think about you , I think about love . - You 're under arrest . - Is there a law against trying to get laid ? Not him ! The girl ! We knew that . You 'll have to come with us . Adam to Chanel , important change of plans . Meet at 1700 at ... You can 't take her ! She 's mine ! Come on , let 's get him ! Heinz here . Lumis-Foil eroding . Ship in great danger . Meet at science fair at 1700 . - But the ... - Forget about the Constitution . Meet at the science fair at 1700 . Over . But , Chanel ... that stuff they 're saying about you being an alien . Is any of that true ? - Of course not , Eddie . - Oh , good . Can 't this thing go any faster ? I didn 't put a 427 with a four-barrel Holley carb in here for nothing . You dance so good , I think we 're ready for the big time . Did they see us come in here ? No , I think we 're safe in here . Besides , I 'll take care of you . I 'm real thirsty . Why don 't you get us something to drink ? Great idea . I 'll meet you on the dance floor . Chanel-6 to Adam-11 . Come in , Adam-11 . Adam-11 . Did not receive entire message . Please repeat . You didn 't hear it ? Where were you ? In order to protect this mission I was unable ... If you don 't make it to the science fair by 1700 ... this mission will never have existed . One hour and counting . Being and freedom . Why do I say these words in the same breath ? The Constitution . I must have your shirt . There 's a sale on them at the Rainbow . You mean there 's more than one ? Sure . Everybody 's wearing them . I 'll give you $ 500 for yours . All right , $ 1,000 . Now , don 't get me wrong , it 's not easy to " ' be . " ' Thank you . Thank you , Dr. Cash . You would all just " ' be . " ' Excuse me , Heinz Asshole . What are you doing ? I 'm exercising my freedom of choice and leaving . No , you don 't understand . I was speaking metaphorically not literally . You see , freedom is very tricky . Dr. Cash , I don 't understand . On the one hand , you tell us to make freedom our own ... but you prevent us when we choose to do so . This corruption of meaning is like something I 've heard about called ... Watergate . Let 's use it . What can we learn from this ? Dr. Cash , I have learned enough . Now I must leave . Heinz ? People ... take a look at Heinz . Heinz , let them see a man ... who came here ... a man who changed here ... and a man who 's now ready to leave here . And why ? Because he got it . Let 's give him a hand . What idiots ! Oldest trick in the book ! Thirty-seven minutes and counting . - Honey . - Honey . ¿ Qué pasa ? - Hello , Bob and Jean . - Hello . - I was just at the Being seminar . - Funny , that 's where we 're going . And I need your car . Dr. Cash said that if I wanted something , I should just take it . Well , go ahead , by all means , take it . - Think he 'll bring it back ? - Honey , you know it 's not about that . You don 't understand . I must get to Liberty Park . Hold your horses , babe . We haven 't even boogied yet . Besides , I took the liberty of entering us in the dance contest . But there 's no time . Let 's dance . Now you 're speaking my language . Chanel-6 to Adam-11 , imminent arrest at the Starlight Discotheque , 15th and Main . Chris , Tommy , come here . How far is 15th and Main ? You can 't leave now . The fair is starting . The Tetra-cell isn 't even ... All right . Just keep adding the tetrahydrozoline . When the Tetra-cell is full , add the carbon dioxide . Slowly at first . Then gradually increase it until it starts to foam up , then seal it . Wait . What was the first part again ? Don 't worry . I think I got it . Let 's just go . Why don 't you go ? Because there 's a line , that 's why I do not go . You 're obstructing my freedom of choice . I 'll obstruct your colon if you don 't shut up ! Fuck you ! Please gather around , everybody . Our own Chester McAndrew will now demonstrate his project . Very appropriate for the Bicentennial , I may say . A self-propelled , waving American flag . Chester ? - Why ... - Go ahead . Why , in this modern age , must we rely on the wind ... to keep the flag looking good ? I say , keep Old Glory waving proudly all year ' round . Pretty good . Thank you , Chester . Keep her going . Look at that . Look at couple number one go . Check them out . Ikiki Beach . Bad housekeeping , paleface . One day , at this rate ... there won 't be any beaches left for you to look at . How did you know ? Seven minutes and counting . Buddy , you honk at me one more time ... I 'm gonna ram that Pacer up your ass ! All right ! That does it ! Well , hello , Chris , Tommy .

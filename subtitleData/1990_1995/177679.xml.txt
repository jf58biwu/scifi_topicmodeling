 [ loud squawking ] Oh , don 't try to pretend with me , Ben Grimm . I don 't have to see your face to sense you 're upset about something . Oh , well , it 's just Stretcho 's been so blamed busy trying to crack the Negative Barrier , so he can free that girl Crystal for Torchy . He 's even called in some fellow egghead from outta state , a guy named Banner . When 's the professor gonna get back to lookin ' for a way to turn me into a regular guy again ? You know , so you and me can have a ... well , normal life . Oh , Ben . Why can 't you get it through your thick head ? The only thing that could make me sad is the thought of any change at all in you . Yeah . Well , maybe being The Thing ain 't all bad . Of course not ! In fact , it 's very nice . We can sit here in the park after dark and with you I 'm perfectly safe . How many people can say that ? There 's nothing alive that you can 't handle . Not even someone like , well , the Hulk , or ... The Hulk ? ! Why bring up that muscle-bound muddy green creep ? Well , I 'm sorry , it 's just that I heard on the radio he 'd been spotted in the New York area . But he disappeared again before being captured . Yeah , well , lucky for him . I mean , the Apple 's my turf . - Boy , if I ever find him ... - Come on , let 's go ! Huh ... ? You rotten little punks ! Did you losers just make a career mistake ? [ dove coos ] [ man ] Hey , no ! [ Thing grunts nearby ] No ! We 're sorry . We didn 't know it was you ! In this case , ignorance ain 't bliss , punks . [ Alicia ] Ben , please don 't ! Don 't ! [ mutters ] Well , if you say so , darling . [ robbers ] Oof ! Hulk like park quiet ! Now a green one ? Ben , what are you doing to them ? Me ? Nothing . Although I shoulda ... I don 't believe my baby blues . - Stand behind me . - What ? ! The lady 's with me , Mister Greenjeans . Girl not belong with ugly rock thing like you . So that explains your coloring . Green with envy . Well , pallie , I don 't envy what 's gonna happen to you . [ grunts and groans ] Hulk is bigger . Hulk is stronger . Hulk is dumber . Thing is faster . [ squawks ] Hulk can 't be hurt . Yeah , but Hulk can be clobbered . [ roars ] Huh ? That right hook woulda flattened Mount Rushmore . [ sirens wail ] This was a hot tip ! The Hulk is stomping ' the Thing . And we got us an exclusive ! Hulk bury ugly rock monster . Oh , my sweet Aunt Petunia ... Whoa ! [ man ] Look out ! [ mutters ] You sure that 's the best you can do , Buttercup ? The longer Hulk fights , the stronger Hulk gets . Yeah ? Well , the smell 's really startin ' to get to me ... [ Alicia ] No ! Stop ! Oh ... ! Please , please stop fighting ! Hulk make girl unhappy ? So Hulk go . What a story ! Beauty and the Beast . Stop him ! [ roars ] The puny minions of justice may be incapable of stopping the green behemoth , but nothing escapes from Victor Von Doom . Incredible ! Then the stories about this green monster ... Are very true . The Hulk is quite possibly the strongest being on the planet . Certainly stronger than that accursed Thing . The vulgar monstrosity who caused me such pain . The Hulk 's footprints transform into human ones with the same strong Gamma-Ray emanations I have been tracking across the country . As I suspected , the Hulk has a human alter ego . And now for the answer . This Gamma-Ray patch was just another failure , Rick . When will I find a way to stop becoming the Hulk ? Don 't give up hope , Dr. Banner . Now try to get some rest . You don 't want to be assisting Reed Richards with bags under your eyes . [ Doom ] How ironic . Reed Richards has considerately brought the Hulk to New York , where I shall avail myself of his presence to decimate the Fantastic Four ! [ Thing ] No ! Lousy stinkin ' reporters ! Did you see these headlines ? " Hulk trounces Thing . " " Blind Beauty saves Beast from Beast . " Pipe down , you big brick . I 'm trying to watch here . [ TV newsreader ] ... badly beaten by the much stronger Hulk . - Oh , Benjy . He dropped you like a ... - Johnny . This is downright humiliating ! [ Reed sighs ] What 's going on out here ? [ Sue ] Honey , you look terrible . And our resident rockpile feels terrible , 'cause he tangled with the Hulk and got his ... Hey , you care to rephrase that , junior ? Okay , you two . Here 's some good news . I 've been working with these rare chemicals which , when bombarded with Gamma Rays , might just be able ... Yeah , I know . Get that girl Crystal and this shrimp back together . Yeah , yeah , I know . That 's all you ever think about any more . Actually , Ben , the project Reed 's been working on is a cure for you . Huh ? Say what ? [ Reed ] That 's right , Ben . Preliminary results look promising . And since Gamma Rays could be the key , I called in an expert . Dr. Bruce Banner . H - He 's on his way up now , to ... to help me ... What ? Stretcho , what 's the matter ? Reed ! Honey , you 're burning up . I - I 'm just ... tired ... [ man ] Dr. Richards ? Dr. Banner . We finally meet . I - I was hoping you could help Ben , here . Hey , hey , hey . Forget about me , Stretcho . [ Thing ] What counts is getting you back on your rubbery feet again . Come on , pal . [ Dr. Banner ] Hmm . Prolonged exposure to those rare potent chemicals has caused Dr. Richards ' fever . My spectrum analysis should be done by morning , and then I 'll attempt to bio-engineer a serum to restore his strength . Meanwhile , my assistant and I have constructed a liquid pool unit to reduce and control his fever . Sheesh ! You and Stretcho must have gone to the same school of gizmo-making . [ Johnny ] ' Night , Doc . See you tomorrow . You 're sure it 's okay , Johnny ? You asked if you could take the air cycle for a spin , so spin ! [ gasps of surprise ] [ squawks ] [ footsteps ] [ groans ] Who 's there ? Allow me to introduce myself , Dr. Banner . Victor Von Doom . [ grunts ] [ roars ] Oh , don 't change on my account , Doctor . No ! Aagh ! Gamma Rays ! Aagh ! At least , not yet . [ laughs ] [ Doom ] You 're guest of honor at my Latverian Embassy , Dr. Banner . In fact , I 've prepared a suitable room especially for your needs . I call it the Gamma Ray Suite . Let me go , Doom . Without my help , Reed Richards might die . Reed Richards , dead of a virus . How common . Not quite the ultimate vengeance I 'd always hoped for but tidy nonetheless . Oh , and yes , I will let you go . [ clicks fingers ] [ Doom ] After the Hulk destroys the remainder of the Fantastic Four . No ! Ahh ! [ roars ] - Who are you ? - I 'm your friend , Doctor Doom . Rick Jones is Hulk 's only friend . Oh , tut tut . Not any more , I 'm afraid . Rick Jones has made new friends . [ grunts ] [ Doom ] He 's deserted you , Hulk . He has betrayed your trust and joined the Fantastic Four . And they have turned him against you . No ! No one leaves Hulk ! But the answer is simple . To make Mr. Jones your friend again , you have only to destroy his new friends , the Fantastic Four . Yes ! Hulk destroy Fantastic Four ! Hey , Rick , my brother-in-law is not doing so hot . Where 's Doc Banner ? He 's supposed to be at our place already . I - I 'm sure he 'll be back . Sometimes he just kinda disappears for a while . We ain 't got a while , kid . The professor 's depending on Banner 's help . You steal Hulk 's only friend . Oh , yeah . I 've been achin for a rematch , Chuckles . Hulk , no ! [ Johnny ] Flame on ! Why Rick hurt Hulk 's feelings ? Leave Hulk for new friends ? But I didn 't ! I wouldn 't ... Rick lie , try to trick Hulk . Hulk tired of talk . [ Torch ] Rick , what 's he talking about ? Hulk want friend back . Hulk fight to get friend back . Torch wanna pitch . The Thing wanna hit . [ Rick ] Stop fighting , Torch ! You 'll make the Hulk madder , which will only make him stronger . Hulk has trick for fire boy . Oh ! Shock wave ! Ooof ! [ groans ] Hey , kid , you okay ? Once Hulk grab rock monster , he never get free . Never say never , you big green creep . Yah ! Oof ! I gotta stop this ! Oh , but I 'm so enjoying this athletic little Donnybrook . Come and get me , mold face . It 's the rematch New York has been waiting for . But once more , the Thing is being badly beaten by the much stronger Hulk . Ben ! Oh , no ! [ reporter ] And the Torch has been KO 'd by the unstoppable nightmare in green . Ben ! The city wonders , where are Sue Richards and Mr. Fantastic ? What are they waiting for ? I don 't want to leave you . But I 've got to help Ben . I love you , Reed . [ Reed groans ] Oh , no ... Must help him ... Ben ! So alone , so vulnerable . Tut , tut , tut . I can 't help myself . I must attend to Mr. Fantastic personally . [ Irish ] Saints preserve us ! If that brawny Thing can 't shillelagh that whirligig , how can we ? Huh ? Where rock creature go ? Thanks , Suse . Smart girl , Susan . [ Thing ] Peekaboo ! Thing find you ! Oh , no ! Susie ! Gotcha ! Oof ! Must ... help them ! I 'm afraid that 's entirely out of the question , Richards . Doctor 's orders . Doom ! This doctor prescribes a maximum dosage of Gamma Rays . In your current weakened state , it should prove most fatal . [ Doom ] Come now , Mr Fantastic . You really shouldn 't be out of bed . Oof ! I don 't suppose it would do any good to say " Look out behind you " ? Really , Richards , what a pathetically desperate ploy . What ... ? ! A mere delay of the inevitable . My bionic armor is indestructible . But I 'm betting your Gamma Gun isn 't . No ! Aagh ! - Where 's Doctor Doom ? - No time to worry about that . We have to help Ben and Sue . Why pretty girls always try help ugly rock creature ? 'Cause I floss , Moss Mouth . Sorry , Ben , he 's too strong ... Oh ... Ha ! Ugly rock creature getting weak . Hulk never get weak . That why Hulk always wins . Can 't take much more , unless ... Con Ed can give me an edge . Little tingle not stop Hulk . Ben ! Alicia ... ! Hulk never forgive Fantastic Four . I can 't protect Ben ... much longer ... Hulk , stop ! Please don 't hurt him . He 's not your enemy . I can feel your pain , Hulk . You 're so alone and unhappy , just as Ben once was . Alicia ... Oh , Ben ! See , even rock creature have friends . That why Hulk unhappy , because Fantastic Four stole Hulk 's best friend . Hulk 's new friend , Doom , show him . No , no ! Doom is a bad man , Hulk . [ Reed ] And he isn 't your friend . But I am . - Rick ? - Reed ! I would never leave you to join the Fantastic Four . [ pants ] Such a tragic tableau , worthy of Shakespeare , Rabelais , or Doctor Doom . Ben ! There 's no heartbeat ! Oh ! You 've done well , my friend , destroying the loathsome Thing , as I knew you would . But ... Hulk make girl cry . She 'll get over it . And now for the coup de grâce . No ! Meddlesome youth ! You hurt Rick . Make Hulk make girl cry . You bad . You trick Hulk . Back , you subhuman primitive ! No ! You fool ! - Reed , is he ... ? - Stand back . I 'm going to use high voltage to try to start his heart . Alicia ... I 'm sorry ... Oh , Reed ! Oh , no ! Hey , what 's goin ' on ... ? Oh , no ! N - Not Ben ... No , not the big fella . Ben ... [ Alicia sobs ] Ben ... That 's what I like about you , junior . You 're a real nineties kinda guy , not afraid to show your sensitive side . [ Thing laughs ] I know , I knew you were okay . Yeah , I 'm okay , you 're okay . Well , for once , I 'm glad to be wrong , Ben . Even a genius couldn 't find a heartbeat under that rock . You sure made a fast recovery , mister . Well , thank the doctor . Doctor Doom , actually . The Gamma Rays from his exploding gun knocked out the effects of the chemicals causing my fever . Dr. Banner will be glad to hear that . Wherever he is . And hey , where 'd Rick hike off to ? Hmm . Something tells me there 's a lot more than meets the eye to Rick and the mysterious Dr. Banner . Bad man got away . [ Thing ] One thing 's for sure . That avocado ape 's gonna think twice about another field trip to the Big Apple . Thanks to me . [ Alicia ] Oh , Ben . [ Alicia ] I felt so sorry for him . He was like an angry , lonely child , full of rage and hurt . Yeah . Kinda sounds like some big orange guy I used to know . A big orange lucky guy . - Oh , Ben ! - Alicia .

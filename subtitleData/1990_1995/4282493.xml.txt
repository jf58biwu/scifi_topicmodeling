 ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) S04-E05 - Dimension Jump Arnold ? - Arnold ! - I 'm here , Mother ! Your father and I are terribly worried about your progress at school . - Yes , Mother . - You don 't get the marks you 're capable of . No , Mother . Well , I went to see the headmaster . He said it might be in your best interest to be kept back in Junior D for another year . - Oh . - Is that all you 've got to say ? Well , it is quite difficult to talk when you 're tied upside down to a tree . - Were you playing with Howard and Frank ? - Yes . Well , what on earth were you playing ? I said it was a shame we hadn 't got a swing . They said they could make one . I didn 't realise they was going to make one out of me . Well , that 's nice , darling . Anyway , your father had a word with the headmaster , and we explained how we wanted you to be a test pilot like your brother John , and how this could damage your chances . We got this this morning . You realise how important this is ? This decision could completely alter the whole course of your life . ( " TOP GUN " - STYLE MUSIC ) Whoa ! Welcome home , Ace ! - Bless you , Spanners . Good to be home . - How 'd she behave ? The lightship ? Like a frolicking filly in a pasture . How you got that crate to break the light barrier , I 'll never know . Well , some might say the devilishly brave and handsome pilot did it . Tsh-pshaw ! Nonsense . Any twit can hug the event horizon of a black hole , then loop-de-loop at twice the speed of light , then slam the engines into reverse and blast out of an imploding nebula . It 's you guys with the magic wrenches . You break the records . You 'll be going to this party , I suppose ? Good God , no . Heroes ' welcomes with 21-gun salutes send me to the land of Nod . I 'll be in the mess with the engineering boys , as usual . - See you there at 1900 ? - See you later , Ace . What a guy ! Ah , welcome home , son . You 've been in all of our prayers . Bless you , Padre . How 's little Tommy ? He 's pulled through , thanks to you . Sitting by his bedside day after day , night after night , holding his hand , reading him stories ... You know me , Chaplain . Any old excuse to get out of dinner with the Admiral . Listen , there 's a bash in the mess . It would mean a lot if you were there . - Thank you , son . - 1900 . What a guy ! - Commander Arnold Rimmer reporting . - So , you dog , you 're back . Did you doubt it , with you to come back to ? If only it were true . What are you doing lunchtime ? - Not sure . Why ? - If you 're interested , I 'll be in my quarters , covered in maple syrup . Sorry , Mellie , I don 't fraternise with staff . - I resign . - I 'll be there at 1300 . - You 're back . - ' Fraid so . Thought you might be . Rubber shares went up this morning . - You wanted to see me , Bongo ? - Heard of the dimension theory of reality ? That there 's an infinite number of parallel universes where every possibility exists ? It 's along those lines . The basic tenet states that for every decision that 's made , the alternative decision is played out in another reality . - So ? - The lab boys have created a drive that can break the speed of reality . Those boffins have hammered together a crate that can cross dimensions ? - When do I launch ? - It 's a one-way ticket . - There 's no coming back . - I 'm free at 1500 . This is a prototype . There 's no way of knowing if it 'll get there . - Where 's there , exactly ? - You 'll be in an alternative reality , a reality where there 's another Arnold Rimmer . Some decision was made where he went one way and you went the other . - He may be quite different to you . - Sounds like quite a caper . You 'll do it ? I 'm a test pilot in the Space Corps . It 's my job to do it . I know this probably won 't interest you , but I 'd hate myself if I didn 't suggest it ... - Suggest what ? - If you 're interested , I 'll be in my quarters at lunchtime , covered in taramasalata . Didn 't know your bread was buttered that side . It isn 't . I 'm happily married . A chap like you can turn a guy 's head . I 'm sorry , Bongo . Lunch is ... on Mellie . Would it make any difference if it was ... hoummos ? I 'm sorry , Bongo . I 'm strictly butter side up . Understood . What a guy ! - God speed and bless you , son ! - All systems check . Let 's get this kite up into the big black . Ignition ... Chocks away . Bye , Bongo . Bye , Spanners . Bye , Padre . Bye , Mellie . Smoke me a kipper - I 'll be back for breakfast . ( ALL ) Bye , Ace ! ( ENGINES ROAR ) ( RIMMER ) Lights ! - What ? - What are you doing ? - What am I doing ? - Yes . Just nipping down the cinema to catch the midnight movie . - Dressed like that ? - Yeah . Going to see " Jaws " . You 're going fishing , aren 't you ? That ocean planet we passed . - You 're going without me . - Come off it , man . Don 't be ridiculous ! Why are the lights on ? Let 's go before ... - All three of you . - What 's he talking about ? I dunno . For some reason , he 's got this crazy idea that we 're all going fishing . - Fishing ? ! - " Dear Rimmer , we have gone fishing to that ocean planet we passed . " " We tried to wake you . See you in three weeks . " Oh , please , sir ! I had no choice . - Kryten ! - Why did you want to go without me ? We didn 't WANT to . We thought it wasn 't your scene . I mean , fishing . It 's boring , isn 't it ? I love fishing ! The glow of the dawn , the line arcing into the water ... That 's why we didn 't invite you . There 's no fish . That , at least , is true , sir . There 's no marine life on the entire planet . We 're just gonna sit out on Starbug , dangle the rods over the side and chill out . I don 't believe anybody would go fishing where there 's no fish . We used to do it all the time . We used to go down the canal . We used to go condom fishing . I swear , one time I caught this two-pound black ribbed nobbler ! It was about that big ! Why didn 't you just say , " Dear Rimmer , we 're going fishing and don 't want you to come " ? - See ? That 's what I said we should say ! - Shh ! What is it about me ? It 's always the same old story . It 's not easy to look in that mirror and see a guy nobody likes . How do you think we feel ? We gotta look at it all day ! Look , we just thought you wouldn 't want to come . I try to be liked . God knows I try . I regale you with amusing stories of my time in the Hammond Organ Owners ' Society . You never laugh . I offer to talk you through my photo collection of 20th-century telegraph poles . You 've always got some excuse . None of you like morris dancing . Would that break your hearts , once in a while , getting our knees in the air , the jingle of bells , the clonk of wood on wood ? Every time I suggest it , you pretend to be ill . You 're wrong . We just thought you wouldn 't want to come . Now we know you do , great , you can come . The way you go on , it 's like we 've been planning it for days . We haven 't . - Really ? - Really . All right , I 'll come . Holly ? Oh , who woke him up ? - ( RIMMER ) Steady now , Kryten . - Yes , sir . Best not to rush it and cause an accident , eh ? I have passed my test . I am a qualified pilot . - Mind that star ! - That star is two light years away , sir . There 's no percentage in being a boy racer . OK , you passed your test ... Mind that planet ! - Which planet ? - That planet ! That 's the planet we 're heading to , sir . Excellent . Plot an orbital course . We 'll be there in no time . - Yes , I have , sir . - Yes , and get the second stage under way . - I already have done , sir . - You haven 't correlated the data , have you ? - Yes , I have , sir . - You know your trouble , Kryten ? - What , sir ? - You 're a git . Stupid ... Three weeks stuck with Captain Yawn . It wasn 't my fault . We 'd be OK if you hadn 't blown the gaff . Me ? You woke him up . I could 've sweet-talked my way out of it , but you came blundering in . You are so two-faced . You haven 't got the guts to tell the dude nobody likes him . Oh , brilliant . What am I supposed to say ? " Excuse me . " " You 're as popular as a horny dog at a Miss Lovely Legs competition " ? That 's what I 'd do . I 'd say ... Hi , buddy ! How 's it goin ' ? Oh ... I just had to get out . He 's driving me nuts ! I cannot stand front-seat drivers . Well , come on . We 're on holiday ! Let 's cheer things up a bit . How about some music ? I 've brought my Hammond CDs with me . How about " Reggie Wilson Plays The Lift Music Classics " ? What about " Sounds Of The Supermarket : 20 Shopping Greats " ? Anyone seen the keys to the medical cabinet ? I feel a sudden urge to suffocate myself with a two-pound black ribbed nobbler . - Not Reggie Wilson , please , Rimmer . - You don 't like Reggie Wilson ? What ? ! Not even " Pop Goes Delius " or " Funking Up Wagner " ? I prefer something slightly more melodious , like the death rattle of a man suffering from terminal flatulence . Come on , you bores . Let 's do something . How about we all sing campfire songs ? # Kumbaya , my Lord # Kumbaya ... # Everyone . Kryten . # Kumbaya , Kum ... # - Purple alert ! Purple alert ! - What 's a purple alert ? It 's not as bad as a red alert , but worse than a blue alert . Kind of a mauve alert ... Holly , wipe the rabid foam from your chin and start again . There 's some sort of disruption to the time-fabric continuum . At least , I presume that 's what it is . There 's this big wibbly-wobbly swirly thing headed straight towards us . - What is it ? - I don 't know ! It 's following us ! It 's locked in on us . Something 's coming out of it . It 's going to hit us ! Collision course ! ( KRYTEN ) Emergency ! Emergency ! Adopt crash procedure ! - Where 's the card ? - What card ? The plastic card with the crash procedure on it ! - Don 't panic ! - It should be behind the seats . Shouldn 't we sit behind a woman clutching a baby ? What 's the drill ? - I know . - What ? Sit down , tuck your head between your legs and brace yourself . - Now what ? - Open the in-flight magazine and read . The articles act as a sedative . Look at the contents list - " Salt - An Epicure 's Delight " , " Classic Wines Of Estonia " , " Flemish Weaving The Traditional Way " ... Don 't fight it , man . Let it take you . How can you be so mind-bogglingly flippant ? We 're going to crash ! Stay calm . The more relaxed you are , the less likely you are to be injured . Good luck , everybody . Here it comes ! ( CLATTER ) " The Egyptians were great believers in salt ... " " When most people think of classic wines , they are unlikely to consider Estonian reds , " yet Estonian grapes are among the fruitiest and most subtle ... " " Since the 13th century , Belgium has been the home " of some of the most remarkable weaving to come out of Europe ... " - Is everyone all right ? - Yes , thank God . I 'm fine . Cat ! It 's bad , buddy . It 's real bad . See what I mean ? Red with apricot . I look like a jerk ! I 'm bleeding an unfashionable colour ! If I 'd known , I 'd have worn white . It goes with anything . - Is anything broken ? - Yeah . The stitching 's come away and the lining 's ripped . Somebody , please ! Get me a tailor ! Kryten , get the first aid box . We have to make sure he doesn 't get gangrene . Gangrene ? You think I might get gangrene ? - Yeah . Shh ! - Hey , that might work ! Green with apricot - I could pull that off ! It 's a break , sir . Quite a bad one . I 'll have to snap the bone back into line , and there 's no anaesthetic . Here . Read the in-flight magazine . " Salt - An Epicure 's Delight . The salt on a typ ... " - ( CRUNCH ) - Oooh ! My God ! - Did it hurt ? - No , it 's the article . Have you done my leg yet ? - Holly , what 's the damage ? - It doesn 't look good . We 've lost the port engine , the fuel line 's severed , we 're taking in water , half the electric 's out , and the elastic 's snapped on the furry dice . - What does that mean in real terms ? - Well , you 've got a more tasteful cockpit , but unless you fix that starboard engine within 40 minutes , we start sinking . - Anything we can do ? - Hire a dance band to play " Abide With Me " ? I 'll have to go and fix the engine . - You don 't know anything about engines . - Besides , there 's a 40-knot gale out there . Only a fool or a hero would even consider it . Bingo ! Down there . They 've ditched into the drink . - I 'm bailing out , Computer ! - ( FEMALE V0ICE ) But , Ace , it 's suicide ! I caused the smash , should apologise . Only manners . - Bring her around for another pass . - Ace , don 't go . I love you . Stiff upper modem , old girl . Smoke me a kipper - I 'll be back for breakfast . Name 's Commander Rimmer . Arnold Rimmer . Friends call me " Ace " . I 've come from another dimension . Explain later . First , let 's get out of this pit . What do they call you , matey ? - Uh ... Kryten , sir . - Series 4,000 mechanoid , am I right ? Salt of the Space Corps . - Spanners . - Eh ? Sorry , you reminded me of someone . What 's your handle ? - Lister . Dave Lister . - Of course . Put it there , Dave . You look like a great bloke . What about the guy in the sharp suit ? We just call him Cat . Bought yourself a broken leg , Cat . Love the Cuban heels . Who 's the stunningly gorgeous computer ? Holly . God , it 's me , only much more handsome . Well , I 'm superfluous . Arnie 'll have you out of here in no time ! - He 's a hologram . He can 't touch anything . - Dead , eh ? Commiserations , old man . - What a crushing bore that must be . - You 're me ? Don 't quite understand . It 's to do with us living identical lives up until a decision was made and you went one way , I went the other . Still , can 't hang around chinwagging . Let 's get this box airborne . - What 's your plan , Arn ? - I ... haven 't got one . OK . Right . Well , um ... I suggest this - the engine is repairable , but it 's a two-man job . Any volunteers ? Yeah , OK . I 've got a window in my schedule this afternoon . Not so fast , Davy . You didn 't give Arnie a chance . - He was about to volunteer , weren 't you ? - No , I wasn 't . OK , well , um ... let 's get cracking , shall we , Dave ? What 's the starboard engine 's thrust-to-input ratio , Arn ? - What 's that ? - Well , you can work it out . - What 's the craft 's inertia rating ? - I don 't know . - Well , what 's the PSI ? - I don 't know ! OK , we 'll work it out . Come on , Dave . Better grab a brolly . There 's a drizzle . - Sir , can I have a word in private ? - Of course , old friend . Excuse us . - What 's the prob , Kryters ? - I have a limited understanding of medicine , but it 's plainly obvious that your left arm is broken in several places . Took a tumble . Only a scratch . I cannot allow you to go out in that condition . - You must allow me to go in your place . - I see . - The Series 4,000 isn 't waterproof , is it ? - That 's besides the point , sir . Look , I 'll tell you what we 'll do ... Sorry , no option . Arnie , Kryten 's taken a bit of a whack . Bring him back on-line . - How ? - You don 't know how to do that ? No . Come on , Dave . Let 's get some fresh air . Smoke me a kipper ... Can you do that ? I 'll be back for breakfast . ( WIND HOWLS ) - What 's your favourite music , Dave ? - Eh ? Keeps your spirits up if you sing a song . - I like rastabilly skank . - Right . Aaaah ! Grab my arm , Dave ! Grab my arm ! 'Fraid I 'm going to have to do something a bit sissy now - black out . Sorry about that . Let 's get cracking ! # Whether you like rastabilly ... # Go on , Dave ! Sing that song ! # Whether you like rastabilly ... # Paisley with stripes ... That 's nice ... Green anoraks with furry collars ... They 're great ! Oh , sir ! He 's delirious ! Oh ! Rubber trousers , held down with bicycle clips ... Wow ! " Commander Rimmer . " I ask you . " Ace . " Barf city ! I bet he wears women 's underwear . They 're all the same , his type - hurly-burly , rough-and-tumble macho marines in public , and behind closed doors , he parades around in ball gowns drinking mint juleps , whipping the houseboy . Sir , he 's you ! It 's just that your lives diverged at a certain point in time . I went into the gents , he went the other way . I assume you are making fatuous references to his sexuality . - May I point out ... ? - Yes ! We did it ! ( BOTH CHANT ) Awooga , awooga , awah , awah ! Awooga , awooga , awah ! What a team ! How you did it , I 'll never know . Come on , Ace , it was you ! You reconnected that fuel line . - Only because you held my ankles . - How could you hang upside down AND fix the starboard engine ? ! - What a team ! - I know where I 've seen you two . Weren 't you the centrefold in July 's issue of " Big Boys In Boots " ? Say what you like about me , but I won 't hear a word against Skipper . - " Skipper " ? ! - He deserves a nickname . - " Skipper " sat rather well . - " Ace " and " Skipper " ? ! You sound like a kids ' TV series about a boy and his bush kangaroo ! Don 't listen to him , Skipper . Let 's get this tea chest back to the small rouge one , eh ? Yeah , so you two can have a nice hot soapy bath and play " spot the submarine " . Sir , the Cat - I don 't think he 's going to last much longer ! Bri-nylon underwear ... Sock suspenders ... - Suits with cardigans ! - Sir , he 's delirious ! His leg 's all swollen . - He may lose it . - ( LISTER ) Lose his leg ? I fear so . The operation is beyond my expertise . Lose my leg ? Hey , that 's terrible . None of my suits will fit ! Kryten , I 'll need 500ccs of corticoadrenaline , two pints of plasma , a laser scalpel and some kind of tissue sample . Oh , my God . Field microsurgery - part of basic training in the Special Service . I 'll go scrub up . I 'll go and throw up . - How 's the Cat ? - Oh , Ace did it . Cat 's fine now . He 's sitting in bed looking through some swatches , trying to find material he likes for his dressings . I don 't know how Ace does it . He 's been awake 36 hours . He 's still joking . What a guy . He 's teaching Kryten how to play the piano . Amazing dude . So , is it a simple registry office or a full church do ? I don 't understand your attitude . He 's you ! He 's not me ! I 'm me ! He 's a me who had all the chances that I never got . No , it was just a single incident , and your lives went off in different directions . It 's incredible to think that one decision could produce such different people . Right . He probably went to some really great school , while I was lumbered with Io House . He met all the right people , greased his way up the old boy network , towel-flicked his way into the Space Corps , Masonic-handshook his way into flight school and brown-tongued his way up the ranks . You 'd think you 'd be pleased that in another dimension there 's another you doing well . How would you feel if some git arrived from another dimension , another Lister , with wall-to-wall charisma and a PhD in being handsome and wonderful ? Hey , man , I AM that Lister ! No , how would you feel if there was another Lister doing better than you ? There is . Ace knows him . That 's why he called me Spanners . In Ace 's dimension , he 's a flight engineer , married to Kristine Kochanski , twin boys , Jim and Bexley . I made up for him . Whatever he did that I didn 't , he deserves it . For me , it makes sense of stuff , to think that every possibility is played out . There 's probably a really weird dimension where you 're better-looking than me . Well , it makes me bitter . You know I never got the breaks . Well , there 's living proof of what I could have achieved . - ( ACE ) Skipper , got a mo ? - Go on . He 's probably picked a ring . Skipper , I 've decided I 'm not going to stay . - Why ? - Him and me . It would never work . I can 't stand the man . To see myself so warped , bitter , weaselly . The man 's a maggot . - So where are you going to go ? - Just out there . I can 't go back , but there 's a billion realities to explore , a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet . Maybe there 's one who 's more of a pain than him ... but I doubt it . Well , good luck . Don 't be too hard on Rimmer . You got the break , he didn 't . Do you know what that break was ? Aged seven , one of us was kept back a year . Put your finger on that , will you , Skipper ? That 's the only difference ? Rimmer went down a year ? No , I was the one who went down a year . By his terms , he got the break , but being kept down a year made me . The humiliation - being tallest in the class by a clear foot - it changed me , made me buckle down , made me fight back . - I 've been fighting back ever since . - While he spent his life making excuses . Maybe he 's right . Maybe I did get the lucky break . I 'll be off , Dave . Smoke me a kipper , Skipper - I 'll be back for breakfast . Ready ? I 'll smoke him a smegging kipper . Now !

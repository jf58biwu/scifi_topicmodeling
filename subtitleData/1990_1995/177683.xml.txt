 [ man ] Amongst the mightiest , the most savage of all Earth 's creatures , I sit in peace , I dwell in safety . For food has been plentiful , and no longer do they hunger . Unlike the humans who call you beast , there 's no violence in your heart , no hint of avarice , no smoldering hate . Yet man , who has won dominion over all this world , is a stranger to peace , a prisoner caught in the net of his own nameless fear . And here stand I , hopelessly trapped in a world of madness , where reason is shunned while violence prevails . But no longer shall the Silver Surfer be part of man 's insanity . Let humanity do what it will . As for me , I shall dwell amongst the beasts , or search for some semblance of freedom in the polluted skies of this mad , orbiting prison which men call Earth ! I , who have crested the currents of space , I must resign myself to this pale blue orb upon which Galactus has sentenced me to remain ... forever . [ man ] The web is woven . My prey is in sight . [ woman screams ] - What ? - Help me ! Oh , please , help me ! What has this woman done ? Nothing , I swear ! I was merely bringing Grandfather some firewood ... - [ soldier ] Cut from the royal forest . - Wait . This does not concern you , alien . The law forbids it . [ woman screams ] [ woman gasps ] [ woman ] I thank you for your kindness , stranger . Please have tea with Grandfather and me ? Grandfather ? We have company . You ! Welcome to my humble cottage . [ cries out ] [ Doctor Doom laughs ] [ Doctor Doom ] Yes . Yes . Once again , the Silver Surfer 's power cosmic is mine . Power enough to challenge Galactus himself . Your Highness . Well done , my dear subject . You have earned the greatest reward of all . The gratitude of your sovereign . Imagine , I now possess the power to end hunger , to abolish disease , to eliminate crime , to establish a perfectly content , perfectly ordered world . All under the benevolence of my iron will ! - But first , ... - [ gasps ] I have a little unfinished business with the Fantastic Four . [ eerie organ music ] - [ mumbling ] - [ footsteps ] - [ bang ] - Yaaa ! Easy , Ben . Sorry . Sorry ? You 're sorry ? My heart ... It 's just my suitcase . Suitcase ? It ain 't you , Stretch , it 's this book , The Zombies Of Madison County . I 'm just at the part where the zombie dentists run wild , flossin ' everyone ... I 'm all packed for a romantic weekend . Ready to sweep me off my feet ? Hm , consider yourself swept . Ben , you 'll be okay with those zombie dentists ? Hey ! Takes more than floss to scare me ! Johnny and Crystal should be back from the movies soon , and then you 'll have company . You have our number at the lake ? Huh ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Go , already ! [ lightning ] Oh ! Man , I gotta switch to decaf . [ laughter ] Ho ! What the ... ? Yaaah ! Doom ! Hey , that 's the Surfer 's ride you 're on ! Quite true , you insufferable blot on the escutcheon of humanity . And as possessor of his cosmic powers , I am now veritably undefeatable . Yeah ? That 's the same mouthful you mumbled the last time you stole the Surfer 's gig , Metal-puss , and you ended up getting your tin tail shellacked by Galactus . Gah ! I assure you , that is not an error I will repeat . I 've monitored Galactus ' movements for some months . At the moment he is quite occupied , at the other end of the galaxy . Now , feel the limitless power in these very hands which you once nearly crushed . Oooph ! Yaah ! [ Ben ] Hey , Lead-lips ! - Candygram ! - Aargh ! Company 's coming ! Maybe you swiped the Surfer 's power again , but you got more than a little to learn about how to use it ! [ Ben ] Yaah ! Yeuh ! Now sing , you rotten rust-pot , or I 'll clobber it out of ya piece by piece . What did you do with the Surfer ? You brick baboon ! Why , I ... I ... [ Doctor Doom ] Feel it , Grimm . Feel your body 's metabolism grow slower and slower , until you become a virtual living statue , unable to move , unable to speak , for the rest of your days . And now , if you 'll excuse me , I must pay a long-overdue social call on your friends . [ Doctor Doom ] Do keep an eye out for pigeons . [ laughs ] [ Johnny ] Sis ! Reed ! Hm . Must have left already for the lake . I wonder where Ben is ? [ gasps ] Johnny , look ! Holy ... [ barking ] [ Reed ] I 'm afraid this won 't afford you much protection against the elements . - [ Sue groans ] - Kidding , darling , just kidding . - [ Reed ] What the ... ? - Reed ! [ screams ] Sue ! - [ Sue ] Doctor ... - [ both ] Doom ! Is this a bad time ? [ Crystal ] There he is , by that tree . [ Johnny ] Ben . [ laughs ] Hey , big guy , waiting for a bus ? Johnny , there 's something wrong . He looks frozen , like a statue . Ben ! Ben ? Oh , man . I haven 't seen him like this since he found out about the Tooth Fairy . Strange ... He 's got a heartbeat , but it 's slowed down to a crawl . Johnny , I 'm gonna try something . [ Crystal ] It worked ! I used my elemental power to speed up his metabolism . [ Johnny ] Ben . Ben , buddy , what happened ? [ groans ] Doom ... - [ thud ] - [ Reed groans ] Leaving so soon , Mrs. Richards ? No ! Insolent cockroach . - [ grunts ] - [ Doom groans ] My new-found power allows me to create any weapon I choose . - [ cries out ] - Reed ! Excruciating , wouldn 't you say ? I thought I 'd start with a time-honored classic . And I thought I 'd start by kicking your tin-can ... Ooph ! - Sue , Reed , get going ! - [ Sue ] Johnny , no ! Okay , time to up the heat . What child 's play . The cabin 's gas line could explode any second ! [ Ben ] Hey , Braino , we came to warn you about Doc ... [ groans ] ... Doom . [ Johnny ] That ought to put a little crimp in his cape . [ Doctor Doom ] One would think so , wouldn 't one ? - [ all ] What ? - [ Ben ] Look out . I 'm gonna clobber him so hard , his grandchildren will be born bouncing ' ! Ah , forget it , Ben . His power is simply too great . - What ? - I 'm afraid it 's hopeless . - You 've won , Doom . - [ gasps ] Do with us what you wish . I assure you , I will . Are you nuts , Reed ? Before I surrender to this creep , I 'd rather die fighting . Die ? But who said anything about dying ? Doom is no common murderer . Besides , I would never dream of letting my dearest enemies off that easily . - But , then , why did you ... - Attack ? Call it a lesson in humility , my fiery friend . No . For the Fantastic Four , I have devised a much more fitting revenge . You , the legendary bravest of the brave , shall live out the rest of your days in abject fear , watching helplessly as I bend the world to my will , knowing you are utterly powerless to stop me , that you are no longer important enough for me to destroy . Till we meet again , on Doomsday . Reed , how could you give in to Doom so easily ? - There must have been another way ! - Are you outta your ... Just a little bit of play-acting . During the battle , I noticed Doom passed up many opportunities to finish us off . Right , I get it . So once you figured out he had no intention of killing us , - you pretended to give up ! - Exactly . I played to his vanity , to buy us time to develop an effective strategy . And when you 're playing to his vanity , you 're playing to a packed house ! [ Doctor Doom ] Let mankind beware , for Doctor Doom has attained powers without limit , and this time , there will be no failure , [ screams ] no defeat . - I can breathe life into stone , - [ screams ] or raise the very ocean floor . Hear me , nations of the world . My power is without limit . I can turn day to blackest night , summer to winter . But I am , above all , a reasonable man . Thus , I have granted your leaders one week to surrender to the rule of Doom , or suffer total annihilation . - I say , we nuke his bolted butt ! - [ loud agreement ] Generals , please listen to reason ! Your weapons would have no effect but to wreak untold destruction on innocent people . Shoot , Richards , we gave you four days to find a way to get rid of Doom . You got one more left . After that , we step in . Hard ! Blast it , Stretch , they 're right ! Come on , let 's go and clobber the creep . Come on , Reed , it 's time to move . He 'll put you both out of action before you can throw the first punch . - Aw , says who ? - Says me ! This fight will call for far more than brute strength . Look , are we gonna stand around arguing , or do something ? Aw , I get it . If you can 't be the big hero , you don 't wanna play , heh ? Well , blue-eyed Benjamin ain 't hanging around any longer . I 'm going after him myself , right now ! Johnny ! [ both ] Now look what you 've done . [ electrical buzz ] - [ whoosh ] - What ? Holy cannoli ! Flying can-opener at four o 'clock ! Ack ! Come on ... [ Reed , chuckling ] Perfect . [ pants ] What the ... ? You mean that blasted gizmo is yours ? Sorry I had to use you as a guinea pig , old friend , - but I ... - Not as sorry as you 're gonna be . Yes ! Exactly the response I 'd hoped for . You 're still weak as a kitten . If it can affect a powerhouse like you , imagine the effect on Doom . Hold it . You saying that Flying Rabbit 's gonna KO ol ' Brass Bottom ? Hardly , Ben . This is just a miniature prototype . And it 's most important function isn 't to weaken Doom . - It 's to make him angry . - Gee , great idea , Mr. Wizard . Maybe next , we could sneak up and give him a wedgie . Stark Enterprises is manufacturing a full-size model . - I hope they finish it in time . - [ beeping ] - You see , the basic idea ... - Reed ! Ben ! Johnny 's gone to Latveria to battle Doom to the finish . Alone ! You 've gotta stop him before he gets killed . [ Ben ] I don 't get it . Why 's the little sparkplug think he 's gonna do any better against Doom this time ? Johnny 's been practicing something called his " supernova blast . " He 's never dared use it near people before , but now ... Please don 't let anything happen to him . Hey , being heroes is what we do best . As future Emperor of the Worid , I require a castle befitting my station . You ! Most evil of all who dwell upon this earth . You shall pay for your colossal conceit . [ chuckles ] [ Surfer ] Power such as that which you have stolen from me is too vast , too universal . If it is misused , it can destroy a galaxy . Your unselfish concern touches me deeply , you unearthly clod . You who refused to appropriately wield your cosmic powers . I , on the other hand , shall use them to enslave an entire planet . And after that , perhaps a universe as well . - [ Johnny ] Hey , Your Highness ! - What ? Be glad to help with the demolition . So , the young cub defies me . Oh , how tedious . I fear your nuisance forces me to retract my magnanimous offer to let you live ! [ Johnny ] Yeah ? Well , let 's see you retract this , Doom ! - [ Doom ] As you can see ... - What ? ! ... I altered my body into a crystal that can withstand a million degrees Celsius . Then I 'll just up the ante to two million degrees ! Get your sunscreen ready , Tin Man ! Amusing as this may be , please forgive me if I cut short our tête-à-tête . By exterminating you ! - [ Johnny shouts ] - [ Doom laughs ] [ Reed ] That 's him ! The output of Doom 's cosmic power makes him easy to track . - What about Johnny ? - [ Thing ] Aw , c 'mon . Don 't worry . The little mosquito chaser can take care of himself . Take care of yourself , kid . [ Reed ] Jump to the tree ! - Reed ! - Hang on , Sue ! I 'm releasing one hand . Brace yourself ! All right , Doom . Show yourself ! I ain 't leaving till I wrap this hunk o ' termite food around your neck ! [ Doom ] Indeed , you shall not leave . You grimy , grotesque abomination ! [ Sue ] Johnny ! - Johnny ! - [ Johnny groans ] Thanks heavens ! He 's alive . Exemplary ! Let 's have some sport first , shall we ? Sue ! A force shield . - Ben ! Incoming ! - Gotcha ! [ Doom cackles ] Wonderful ! A more spirited game than I dared hope for . Get ready to eat those words , Nickel Nose ! A bold counteroffensive , Mrs. Richards . Unfortunately , it will be your last . [ Johnny ] Cool ! Way to sucker in Doom by making that boulder invisible . We just need more time . Okay , Fender Face . It 's my turn . [ Doom ] No , fool . Our little sessión is now ended . Your feeble efforts at self-preservation no longer amuse me . I now call on the most destructive of my cosmic powers . The power to disintegrate living matter ! For example , you ! Sorry , Doom . - We 'll have to take a rain check . - What ? ! What is happening ? [ Reed ] It 's my anti-cosmic flying wing . Courtesy of Tony Stark . And just in time to drain you of your misbegotten powers ! Not quite . As you see , your little weapon has fled . My cosmic power is too great for any of your pathetic contrivances . Hey ... You did your best , Reed . Yes , Richards , your pitiful best . And it wasn 't quite good enough . Now my victory is doubly sweet . For even your overrated intellect couldn 't vanquish me . No ? Are you so certain my flying wing won 't be back to defeat you ? Defeat my cosmic power ? It is the fabric of creation . Ultimate power ! The stuff of gods ! As a final courtesy , I shall allow you to watch as I obliterate first your puny toy . And then , ultimately , yourself . Oh , Reed , we 've failed . Not necessarily , darling . Crystal ... Send it towards the stratosphere . Everything is going according to plan . What ? ! No ! [ Reed ] Here it is ! It 's all over . [ Sue ] The board is returning to Doom 's castle . Hey , hello ! Anybody want to show all their cards here ? See , Doom made one fatal mistake , Johnny . He didn 't know Galactus left a cosmic force barrier to keep the Surfer trapped on Earth . My instruments detected it two days ago . [ Surfer ] Though invisible , its walls are thicker and more powerful than any prison made of stone . [ Ben ] Oh , I gotcha ! So when your flyin ' wingding hot-rodded for outer space , you was hoping Ol ' Lead Lips would follow it . He 'd wipe out on the barrier . And the Surfer 's power would shoot back to the tinfoil boogie-boarder ! Then you mean Doom is finally ... Well , maybe . But with Doom , what you see is rarely what you get . I have much to learn of the ways of human beings . It is true you are slaves of greed and fear . And yet ... There is a nobility in your hearts that cannot be denied . Perhaps one day I will understand .

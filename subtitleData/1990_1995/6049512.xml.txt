 [ theme music plays ] [ Narrator ] Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel . The speed of light , and the desire to help all mankind . He is ... Superboy . [ man ] Aww . [ man chuckles ] Fifteen years . You really get to know somebody in that time . So , when Fran came into my office to tell me that she was going to leave the bureau to get herself a PhD , I had a very natural question for her ... Who the hell are you ? So , in order to answer that question , I have made a very thorough study of Fran 's life , and I will now share it will all of you . " Fran was born ... [ coughs ] ... years ago . On a small farm in Georgia . Her parents were poor . Very , very poor . How poor were they ? How poor were they ? They were so poor they couldn 't pay attention . [ man chuckles ] Pay attention . [ TV news plays ] So , at the age of 17 , Fran began to explore unexplained phenomena 's . [ TV reporter ] ... the pair knocked the bailiff unconscious , and got away from the courthouse with his gun as well as the gun of another bailiff . Police have blocked off a 12 block section of the downtown area and are searching door to door ... Another beer , pal ? Yeah , give me another one . What about your friend here ? He 'll be out in a minute , ask him then . OK . One beer coming up . Who are those people over there ? They 're regulars . They work down the street . - How late do they usually stay ? - Ten or eleven . They 're real party animals . [ man ] ... it was so hot . How hot was it ? - [ siren wails ] - It was so hot , the door was open . - What 's the matter ? - Nothing . [ man ] She was so ugly . Forgive me , Fran , forgive me for saying this . When Fran was born , she was so ugly , the doctor slapped her mother . [ laughing ] - Hands up ! - [ screams ] [ man ] Hands up ! Get your hands up . Get your hands up ! - Freeze ! - [ woman continues screaming ] Shut her up ! Now , didn 't you hear what the man said ? Hands up . You 're not going anywhere tonight . Everybody sit down . Shut up . Nobody 's going to get hurt . Do you understand me ? Your the ones that got away from the courthouse this morning . You heard about that , did you ? Well , maybe you can tell me what they 're trying me for . You know you 're lucky . I 've got more important things on my mind . You blew it . All we had to do was sit here and wait the cops out . - He knew ! - He knew nothing ! You panicked . [ stammering ] What are we gonna do now ? Same as before . We 'll wait ' em out here . With our new friends . [ knocking ] No . You . Get behind the bar . Continue the party . You . Get the door . - Evening , officer . - Evening . Why is the door locked ? Well , we 're having a private party . Mind if I come in ? Well , normally I wouldn 't mind , but ... . ... you see , the party 's getting kind of crazy now , and they 're getting ready to cut the cake , and you know , for a policeman to walk in ... I don 't care how drunk you are , I 'm just trying to find a couple of escaped convicts . - You gonna let me in , or not ? - Just a minute . [ sings ] For she 's a jolly good fellow . [ all ] For she 's a jolly good fellow . For she 's a jolly good fellow . Which nobody can deny . - See ? - [ officer ] Out of the way . [ man ] Well , don 't you need some kind of warrant ? [ officer ] Warrant ? [ man ] Well , I mean , this is a private business . It 's my understanding that law officers can 't enter any private establishments without some kind of appropriate document signed by a judge . All I want to do is just look ... I don 't know what else can go wrong tonight . [ sighs ] What are we gonna do when he comes back ? Same thing I was gonna do last time . Excuse me . There 's another way out of here . Yeah ? The back door leads to some alleys , nobody ever uses them . It 's true . These doors here . Well , you better not be lying . And I suppose you 'll give me your word you won 't call the cops the minute I 'm gone . We just want you out of here so that nobody gets hurt . Yeah , sure . Come on . Ow ! What 's the matter ? It 's frozen ! Must lead to a freezer or something . You knew , didn 't you ? It wasn 't any freezer . You knew . There 's no need to get violent . You want some of the same ? Sit down ! Don 't try anything ! - Sit down ! - Stop it ! Stop it ! Leave him alone ! Sure ... I 'll leave him alone . A favor for a favor . Right ? Are you OK ? Yeah , I just need a place to lie down . Um ... maybe I can go to the office for a few minutes . You go with him . And you make sure they can 't get out . [ groans ] I 'll be OK , really . Why don 't you just rest , OK ? She 's right . You might have some broken ribs . I was a medic in the service . - I have no pain , really . - If you say so . Wait ! You know , you 're not like your friend . He 's not my friend , he 's ... You 're different from him . - That 's not what the law says . - Please ? Just leave the phone here . [ scoffs ] What , are you crazy ? You 'll call the cops . Yeah , I would , because I don 't want to see anyone get hurt . No one 's going to get hurt . Well , if you haven 't noticed , your friend 's a little psychotic . We 'll tell the police you cooperated . Right . Next thing you 're gonna say is that I should trust ya . The only way to get of here . My lawyer said I should trust him . So did the judge and the DA , they all use that word . And I got six years for being in the wrong place at the wrong time . For being stupid enough to trust people . [ groans ] Lana , I could use a little rest , would you mind going back inside ? Clark , this is our chance to get the police . And besides , you might have internal injuries . I 'm not going to let you out of my sight for two seconds . We could rush ' em . What are you talking about ? We 've got to , who knows what they 're gonna do to us . Just sit tight , OK ? We can take ' em . It 's worth a try . Not if somebody gets killed . I can 't believe you . Maybe somebody else will have the guts . [ sighs ] You 're never gonna break those bars . Lana , if you would just let me get some rest for a few minutes . Alone . Why do you keep wanting me to go out there with those psychos ? You know , you might have a concussion . I don 't want to let you fall asleep . [ sighs ] Yeah , you 're probably right . Would you mind loosening my shoes ? Sure . [ sniffs ] Do you smell smoke ? There 's a fire extinguisher in the bar . OK , I 'll be back in two seconds . That 's all I need . [ knocking ] I put the fire out . What are you doing up ? I feel much better . Well , then you can get yourself out of here , now . I don 't think ... The lady and I want to be alone . I said get out of here . [ stammers ] It 's OK , Clark . I 'll be OK . Lana , I 'm not going . I am not going to tell you again . You won 't have to . [ criminal ] Perkins ! Cops ! We 'll take care of this later . [ knocking ] [ Officer ] Come on , open up . All right , you . Do a better job than you did last time . Everything 's OK in here . [ Officer ] Really ? Some shopkeeper down the block told me he saw two guys come in here ... They 're in here ! Clark . Clark ! You could 've been killed pulling a dumb stunt like that . Well , I was an Eagle Scout once , you know . Go ahead . Start shooting , come on ! First one going down is going to be this kid . Much better . Now you listen to me . I want a half a million dollars in cash , and a helicopter . You 've got one hour . You don 't deliver , and I 'm going to blow his brains out . And if you don 't think I will , just imagine how that 's going to help my insanity plea . So , get me what I want . Or , you 're going to be real surprised . We should 've heard by now . Something 's wrong . They could be putting a deal together . Are you sure you plugged that phone back in ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Well , time sure is going by awfully slow . You know that clock hasn 't moved . Would you do something ? [ clamoring ] Look , I need the money out here within the next 15 minutes , all right ? Just do it ! Barker , how come they haven 't got that hydrant fixed yet ? The utility guys won 't come out , Lieutenant . Something about not wanting to get their heads blown off . All right , what 's the situation inside ? It 's Perkins and Cooper all right . They 've got about 10 hostages in there . I 've been negotiating with them . Negotiating ? That 's not our policy . Lieutenant , these men are killers . All the more reason , Barker . Just let me keep talking to them , all right ? No ! Lieutenant , they 're expecting a call from me . All right . Well , maybe a call isn 't such a bad idea . It 's not too late . I 'm in too deep . No , you 're not . Not yet . But you will be if he tries to kill me . He won 't kill ya . We 'll get what we 're asking for . And what if you don 't ? You sure he won 't pull the trigger ? You want that on your conscious ? [ phone rings ] Answer it . [ ringing continues ] [ Barker ] We need a little more time to put the money together . - They need more time . - How much time ? How much more ? Not a lot . Most of the money is already assembled . Not a lot . It 's got to be a clean shot . [ Lieutenant ] Clean as a whistle . Get down ! [ all screaming ] [ stammers ] I saw the light from the lamppost . Shining off the gun barrel . And now , I warned them what would happen ! Hold it ! What ? I 'm giving myself up . I 'm taking these people with me . Well , you 're just going to go back to jail . Better that than killing somebody . Now , let him go . I need him . It 's all or nothing . Get them out . I 'm not leaving you with him . Get as many people out as you can . Yeah . Get out of here . I don 't need you anyway . [ chattering ] Clark ... It 's OK . Go with them . Well , looks like it 's just you and me , kid . It looks that way . Come on ... you 're my ticket out of here . I don 't think so . You don 't think so ? What the hell is that ? Some kind of joke ? The jokes on you , pal . I 've been waiting a long time for that . [ Barker ] All right guys , lock and load , we 're going in . Police ! Freeze ! Nobody move ! He slipped and knocked himself out . What about the gunfire ? He 's the worst aim I 've ever seen . - Cuff him ! - Come on ! He 's Superboy . I saw it all . Well , if you say so , I guess I must be . He is Superboy . I saw it with my own eyes . Perkins , you 'd say anything to cop an insanity plea . - Get him out of here ! - Come on ! [ Perkins ] You are Superboy ! I know that you are ! Oh , Clark ! Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm OK . But , would somebody untie me ?

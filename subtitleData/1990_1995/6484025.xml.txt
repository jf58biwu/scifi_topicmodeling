 Last time on " Stephen King 's Golden Years " ... Harlan Williams , tech number 10884 . Custodian third . Scientific history , gentlemen . You were here . The janitor 's growing younger . That means that the ... effects are much more powerful than we thought . - Would you like to see the janitor ? - Yes . At once . Of course . Are you joking ? I want to take the janitor and his wife out of Falco Plains . I want to get them right now . If I don 't , Andrews will . Today you 're 65 . You 'll have a birthday again in a week and you 'll be 60 . And then , a few days after that you 'll be 55 . - I want protection now ! - Stay put . Go to hell . What if it goes all the way to the end ? What happens then ? Is Harlan Williams turning into a child again ? We 've got 150 agents from Pennsylvania to Upstate New York . We 'll have another 150 by noon . It won 't be a problem . I assure you . Shop agents , DSA operatives , maybe the National Guard . Are you saying we don 't have a chance ? Get out of the car . With your hands up . Where 's the girl ? Don 't move . Put the gun down . Very slowly . Some fugitives stole my cruiser . You got a patch suit of that spook yet ? Yes , but there 's heavy static . Never mind the static . This is Ohio State Police Captain Marsh . Is this Andrews ? This is Ohio State Police Captain Marsh . Is this Andrews ? Can you clear that up ? Not if you want to keep this connection secure . Give me that . This is Andrews . What 's your situation , Captain ? - Say that again ? - What is your situation ? You hear me , Captain Marsh ? Turn up the gain . I haven 't got much gain left . Give me what you 've got . We have three fugitives down there and we 're up here fumbling around . Andrews , are you getting me ? Are you getting me any better ? Yes . Good enough . Tell me what your situation is . The man I talked to in Washington said you 'd say a word . So I 'd know who I 'm talking to is who I 'm supposed to be talking to . That word is " castigate " . Tell me what your situation is . God , I hate this bureaucratic bull . The cruise you 're looking for is parked on an old rail bed in the town of Greenbush . We verified the licence number , the markings and the scratch on the right . Where is Greenbush ? Western Ohio . We 've got three people in it . Not moving . It could be couping . Sleeping ? That 's just my estimate , Mr Andrews . I don 't think they 're playing possum , but they could be . So , Mr Andrews , what are your instructions ? My instructions are ... Hey . What the hell are you doing here ? My job . You have no access to the communication facilities . I 'm afraid he does . - Who the hell are you ? - My name 's Burton . He 's taking over from here . Really ? So answer my question . What are you doing here ? Mr Andrews has been put in charge of the search and recovery operation by the Secretary of Defence . I thought you 'd been informed . Recovery ? Is that what you intend ? Of course , General . What else ? Andrews , have we lost you ? Not at all , Captain Marsh . I want your men to open up the car 's tyres and lower body . Keep away from the gas tank . Wash them out . Do you copy ? I copy . You 're going to flush three people . Two women , one older than the other . And a man roughly aged 60 . If we fire at that cruiser with scatter guns , we may wound some of them . Just don 't hit the old man . What about the others ? Waste them . You can 't do that , you damned butcher ! Well , General , you look like you 're in pretty good shape to me . If knocking a couple of my teeth out is worth a court martial , go for it . Say that again . I repeat , say that again . Because I can 't believe I heard what I just heard , Mister ! You know exactly what I said and meant , Captain Marsh . Do you copy ? Do you copy my instructions , Captain Marsh ? I copy . I can read you just fine . Get back to me . Say that again ? Report back to me after the smoke clears . I couldn 't stand to miss the last chapter . Oh , I 'll be in touch . Are you going to do it ? Good God , no . That scumbucket wants anybody wasted , he can do it himself . - Then why did ... - I 'm tired of crapping around . If they wake up , then maybe we will have to shoot . - When the Ohio cop comes back online ... - We 'll get a light , Sir . Good . This isn 't over . Of course not , General . We still have a lot of work to do with Mr Williams . But as for your pet terrier ... You 're a filthy son of a bitch . It 's just as well . He was a party pooper . We 're going part way with this bozo . Tear up the tyres and tear up the ground in front of the car . I don 't want any holes in the car . I don 't want anyone shot . I see any holes in the car and I find out who put them there , that person 's gonna be scraping up road pizza . One year for each hole . - Got it ? - Yes , Sir . Children , unless we learn otherwise , the people in that car are asleep . No danger to us . But if they make a move against us ... you do what you have to do . Arnie , Bill ... left front , scatter guns . Vinnie , Craig , right front , same . Jack , Sean , rear tyres , service revolvers . The rest of you just stand and watch . What about me , Captain ? Try not to pick your nose . And if you forget , try not to park with your fine on your pants . Huh ? Just back us up and wait , Dylan . All right . Move in on the wings . Get to within 30 yards and stop . That ought to be safe enough . To take out the front tyres , sure . Maybe we kick up a little dirt on the first shot , but so what ? That 's why they issue pumps . - Everything will be fine . - Yeah . That 's what they told us in Nam . Sean , Jack , take the ditches . Get as close as you can . I think there 's snakes in those ditches . Never mind that . Just make sure you don 't put a hole in the gas tank of that cruiser . All right , wait for my signal . I 'll drop my hand . All right now everybody , move out . Where the hell am I going ? This is a whole lot different from range practice . If my boys could have your attention for a moment , please . Who shot out the flasher bar ? Road pizza . You , in the car . Throw out your weapons and come out with your hands up . I 'm going down there . Uh , Captain ? If someone in that car starts shooting , he ... Shut your dough hole , Lyons . You . You in the car . I 'm coming over . I 'm not carrying my gun . I repeat . I 'm not carrying my gun . He 's crazy . Let 's stand down over here a little . You know ? Cool out . Let 's get to know each other . Well , folk me till I cry . - Why don 't we call Captain Marsh back ? - No . No , why not ? There are certain men you don 't push . Not unless you want your head handed to you in a wicker basket . Mr Andrews . Mr Andrews . Are you there ? What have you got ? Marsh , do you copy ? We 've lost you . No , no , my friend . You haven 't lost me . But we don 't get to have a shootout with the Three Stooges every day . They put three scarecrows in the cruiser . I think they named them after some fellas who work for you . Mr Andrews , what are ... It was actually quite wise of ... General Crewes to leave when he did . I think if he had been here when ... that happened , I might have ripped his face off . I 'm not sure I understand what ... What happened ? They ditched the cruiser , that 's what happened . I 'm sorry about the radio . I lost my temper . Well , under the circumstances , Sir , it 's ... If there 's anything I can 't stand more than being laughed at , it 's being sucked up to by people who are scared of me . But I am ... sorry about the radio . Shall I get back in touch with Captain Marsh ? I don 't care what you do . Just leave me out of it . For now . I 've got some thinking to do . I 'd say it 's about time , wouldn 't you ? I 'll tell you what though . That bitch has jerked my chain for the last time . Think you can handle it , Harl ? I 'll be fine . And it 's the best way . It 's nuts . That 's what it is . I didn 't come all this way to be separated from you now . They 're looking for three people , Gina . An elderly woman , an elderly man and a beautiful younger woman . I don 't remember anything about beautiful . Can 't you see how scared she is ? I 'm not scared . It 's just ... What they 're not looking for ... is a man all on his own and two women , mother and daughter , taking the bus to Chicago . I just don 't want to be separated from you . It feels wrong . We 'll be together again at our daughter 's house . Is anybody getting on here ? I 've got a schedule to keep . Hold your horses , Mac . You promise ? I promise . Take care , Gramps . You bet , kiddo . You remember the address of that place ? You bet . See you there . Come on , Mom . We don 't want to be left here . Boy , I hate these side-of-the-roaders . They 're not like this on the Indiana side ... . Drive the bus and put your mouth in neutral . - Does that sound okay ? - You can 't talk to me like that ... I love you too , Harl . So much . I love you . Goodbye , Gina . See you soon . Why is that lady crying ? Did she hurt something ? Yes . Kiss it and make it better . - You got me . - Oh , God . You guys are as ugly as ever , aren 't you ? Still got your voice hack up there , Terry ? Of course you do . Your mama didn 't raise no fools , did she ? Well ... At least you 'll have a record of this if ... you ever get back here . I came here to think . It 's the only office at Falco I 'm almost positive Andrews doesn 't have a key to . Almost . Should have known you 'd go rogue . Yeah . From the first time I ... got a look at your friends . You dead yet , Terry ? I wonder . I hope not . I finished with the rewire on panel 4 . Very good . We 'll download the database in the morning . I still have some calculations that I want to do tonight . - What shall I do now ? - Nothing . That 's it for today . You can go home now if you want to . Good night . Thank you . Well ... I 'll see you in the morning . Felipe . Yes , Sir . Lock the door when you leave . Yes , Sir . This is Dr Todhunter and I ... Yes , I 'll hold . Yes ? I need a section of cable patch . Yes . Eight feet would do it . Port number 4663 . What it 's for ? It 's for my work , you idiot . I am not about to allow the advancement of scientific endeavour grind to a halt because I am two feet short of a proper connection ! Now get it over here immediately ! God ... Nobody 's doing any thinking . Plenty of running around , but no thinking . I have to take all the blame myself . I was so sure I could catch them . Just ... reach out my hand and catch them . Yeah , okay . She clouded my judgement , I admit it . This isn 't the first time she 's gotten in my way . Terry Spann and I go back a lot of years . But that 's neither here nor there . The question is , where are they ? Where in hell 's name are they going ? And who 'd know ? Administration section , Mrs Rogers speaking . Let me speak to Major Moreland . I 'm sorry , Major Moreland is updating his files and can 't be disturbed . This is General Crewes , Mrs Rogers . If I 'm not talking to the Major within 15 seconds , you 're going to finish your career as a staff liaison officer in Iraq . I ... I ... General Crewes . I ... I didn 't recognise your voice . - Just get him now . - Yes , Sir . I 'll just ... I 'm not cutting you off , I 'm just putting you on hold . Thank you , Sir . No problem . Where you headed ? - Chicago . - I see we think alike , my friend . Right ... - Dr Todhunter ? - What do you want ? I 've got your cable . Oh . Good . Give it to me . - I need your signature on some forms . - No time . I can 't release this without the proper signatures . Do you have a pen ? Sure . This one 's for Accounting . This one 's for Major Moreland . - Over here , please . - This pen 's running out . - Do you have another pen ? - Yeah ... - Let me hold this for you . - Thanks . Do you think Copernicus had to put up with this ? - Galileo , Einstein ? - Dr Todhunter ! Go away ! Now ... Come in . - Gen ... - Come in , Major Moreland . General Crewes . - That the Williams file ? - Yes . It 's bulky , but you said to bring everything . Including the last two physical exams he took . Now , as to this business about the exams , General Crewes , it was never my policy to obstruct ... I 'm sure it wasn 't . Now call Mrs Rogers . Tell her to send everyone home . - What ? - I want the administration wing empty . Before they shut this place down . Yes , Sir . That is ... When she yells " frog " , does everybody jump ? Yes , Sir . Have her yell " frog " then . And tell her to not answer any more calls . If the phones ring , they 're to let them ring . Got that ? - Yes , Sir ! - Get on it . Mrs Rogers . Moreland . Of course . Falco Plains . How may I direct your call ? Major John Moreland . That 's Administration . All right . Come on ... Come on . Falco Plains . How may I direct your call ? Same as last time . Moreland , Administration . Nobody picks up there . Oh , that 's really not possible . - You see ... - Never mind , operator . - Get me extension 946 . - Yes , Sir . - Hello , Burton here . - Andrews here . - Go to Administration and call me back . - What for ? Just get over there and call me back . Do it now . If there 's anything I can do to help . Yeah , sure is . Power up Terry 's computer . Get connected with Central Records in Washington . I have no authorisation , General . I don 't care about authorisation . Things have gone way past that point . You mean to tell me you can 't get into Central Records ? You don 't spend half your time nosing around seeing what you can find out ? I bet you even had a look at my files . General Crewes , I would never ... Can you get in ? Or can 't you ? Well ... I do have a password . If it hasn 't changed , and there 's a modem on Ms Spann 's computer console ... There is . Just do it . How are we doing , Major ? I 'm in . The code word still works . Try Harlan Williams ' file . Yes , Sir . Once you find it , delete it . - What ? - You heard me . What are you doing ? I know this offends every instinct of your bank clerk soul , but if Andrews hasn 't gotten ahead of us , he 's only one step behind . Andrews ? That scary guy with the dead eyes ? What 's he got to do with it ? I couldn 't even find his name in the ... That 's right . He 's Shop , Major . And you won 't find any Shop personnel files mere mortals like us can access . There 's just one man in the world you 'd less like to have on your tail . That 's me . That 's ... That 's piracy . That 's ... That 's theft . It 's vandalism . It 's against the law . You could go to jail . It 's not a suggestion , Moreland . It 's an order . Well ... I refuse the order . Hello . - Hello . - I told you to call me . You been taking dumb pills again ? They 're all gone . The computers are on . But the people are gone . It 's like a ghost ship in here . - How did you know ? - Never mind how I knew . Listen , and listen closely . Our friend General Crewes , who 's possibly under the influence of his idiot protégé , is also going rogue . - Crewes ? - Shut up . There may be something in the janitor 's file to indicate where they 're headed . He 's trying to wipe them out . All of them . Before we have a chance to get them . You have hard copy on the janitor 's file , don 't you ? Tell me you have hard copy . Hard copy on the janitor 's file ... Why would I have that ? You don 't . - I don 't . - Never mind . Just sit down at one of the terminals and get Central Records in Washington . If we 're lucky , very lucky , we may be able to get to that file before Crewes wipes it . - But how do you know that Crewes ... - I know . I know . If you ever intend to have children , get me that file . Major Moreland , either that file gets deleted , or you do . Well ... If you put the order in writing , General Crewes , I suppose ... Burton , if you screw this up ... I should have it in writing . " When Major Moreland deleted Williams ' file from Central Records , he was following my orders . " Signed , General Crewes . There . Are you satisfied , Major ? Yes . Now ... If you could just date it ... - I 'll date it later . Just do it ! - All right . All right . What if Crewes is trying to get in ... I better lock it out before I delete it . It 's better to be safe . What ... What 's today 's code term ? Today 's word ... Uh ... Today 's word . It 's ... something something . To do with a bird ... Today 's word is ... Sparrowhawk ! Sparrowhawk . - Go back . It has two R 's . - Two R 's . What is going on here ? Who the hell are you ? - Just a minute . - Don 't move . Listen . I am authorised to be here . Yes ! No . No , no , no ... I need to see some identification . Do you see the red border around this badge , my friend ? See that ? If you 'd have been wearing it , it would 've saved us a lot of trouble . I 'm sorry to have bothered you . Not half as sorry as I am . Sir ? Do you know where everybody is ? No , not at all . - But I do know one thing . - Sir ? I wish I were with them . Well ... - It 's done . - Good . Let 's go , Major . - Where ? - Chicago . Windy City . That Toddling Town . I can 't go to Chicago . My wife would kill me . No , she won 't . But I know who might . How are you going to explain to Andrews why you deleted vital information ? Oh , no ... This isn 't going to do you any good . The Department of the Interior will have a complete file . All I 'm trying to do is to tie Andrews up so we have a head start . We 'll need one . But ... I have your orders . I have your written orders . How much difference do you think this piece of paper is going to make to that psycho ? Afternoon , Major Moreland . - Are you all right ? - Yes . I 'm fine . May I have your keys , Sir ? - What for ? - I need to look in the trunk . Why ? Just following orders . Everything seems to be in order . It does ? I 'd get moving while you can . Thank you , son . There comes a time in every man 's life ... And this one is for Central Records . And this one is for Mrs Rogers ' files . And this one is for Legal . And this one is your own personal copy . And ... Warning . This is an improper connection . Please check the wiring sequence book for proper installation . Improper connections can result in serious ... " Could result in serious ... " scientific achievement . Serious ... Very ... serious . What are you looking at ? Just the end of the day . - You 're worried about Harlan . - Harlan can take care of himself . He once beat a man to his knees because the man , who was standing outside a bar , made suggestive remarks about my legs . Harlan was very protective of my honour . And he was very young , of course . He must have loved you very much . We loved each other very much . It seems to me that in those days , the world was filled with love . We didn 't have a pot to you-know-what in , or a window to throw it out of , as Harlan used to say , but we hardly noticed . He was young and strong , and we both believed there was time for him to go to college , after his sisters finished their schooling . He practically raised them , you know . You told me . What is happening to him , Miss Spann ? I mean ... How can he be getting younger like he is ? Do you think you could call me Terry ? Yeah , all right . I guess I could do that . The ... experiments that Todhunter has been running and the particle accelerator that he designed had something to do with regeneration . I don 't understand . He found a way to turn back the clock . To make living tissues get younger . Something all the night creams in the world can 't do . And that 's what 's happening to Harlan ? We 're making good time , Mister . We 're already across the state line . You doze off ? Hey , Mister . Hey , Mister ... What 's going on ? Oh , my God . Oh , my ... - What 's going on ? - It was dark a second ago . - This is a miracle ... - What 's happening ? What 's happening ? Look , it 's ... Oh , man ... You missed this ? The dashboard went crazy , the sun came back up . Mister , wake up . Come on . Come on . This guy is full of green light . It 's him . It 's all ' cause of him .

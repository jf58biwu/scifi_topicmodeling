 Subtitles by demonseye Remember when they used to let commercial airlines land in this town ? Yeah . Well , I don 't understand where we 're going , or why the hell we 're bothering anyhow . - You 're doing a good deed . - Wanna give us a better reason ? Yeah . A maniac hijacked a municipal bus with 30 passengers on it . That 's a pretty good reason . And I got a real bad hunch where those passengers are - and who that maniac is . - You wanna share it with us ? Phoenix . Simon Phoenix . Send a maniac to catch one . Phoenix ! Don 't move , Phoenix . You 're under arrest . Arrest ? Shit . And you 're trespassing . - Where are the passengers ? - Oh , yes , the passengers . Well , they 're , uh ... . Fuck you . The passengers are gone . See , I-I told the city , I said " Look , nobody comes down here " . Postmen figured it out ... policemen figured it out . But the goddamn bus drivers just wouldn 't listen . Last time , Phoenix . Where are the hostages ? To hell with the hostages . This is between you and me . - Yeah . - What ? What ? What you got , soldier boy ? Do something . Go ahead . You 're up to your ass in gasoline . Set your ass on fire . Is it cold in here ? Or is it just me ? - Where are they , Phoenix ? - Now , where did I put ' em ? I swear , I 'd lose my head if it wasn 't attached . I 'll keep that in mind . Damn it , John , I 'm tired of this Demolition Man shit . You were not supposed to come down here . You were not supposed to attempt the arrest of Phoenix singlehanded and you were not supposed to blow anything up ! It 's not me this time , Healey . He dumped the gas and rigged the place to blow . Yeah , right . You had nothing to do with it . I know you 've been trying to nail this psycho for two years . But try remembering a little thing called official police procedure . - But where are the hostages ? - They 're not here . - What do you mean , they 're not here ? - He must 've stashed them someplace else . So , how do you know they weren 't in there ? Are you sure ? Cause I did a thermo check and there was only eight of ' em , all part of his gang . Wrong again ! Hey , you got something to say , scumbag ? - Get ' im outta here . - Let 's go . Oh , you motherfucker . You and I are gonna have a nice long chat . Captain ! Captain ! Over here . There are bodies everywhere . There must be 20 or 30 . They 're everywhere . See that , captain ? I told ' im . He said he didn 't care . Oh , my God ! How could you sacrifice all those innocent people for little old me ? What kind o ' man are you ? We 'll spend a lot of quality time together . See you , sweetie ! Honey ! Sugar ! You got a lawyer . You better call ' im . John Spartan , you 've done great deeds for the city of Los Angeles . So , it is with some regret that I , William Smithers , acting as assistant warden , hereby carry out this sentence . Skip it . Sergeant Spartan , you 've been sentenced to 70 years ' sub-zero rehabilitation in the California Cryo-Penitentiary for the involuntary manslaughter of 30 innocent civilians . Skip it . You 'll be placed in cryostasis for the duration of your sentence , during which your behavior will be altered through synaptic suggestion . You 'll be eligible for parole no earlier than the year 2046 . I 'm sorry , sergeant . All personnel ... the next scheduled parole hearing for prisoner Gilmour will take place at 07 : 15 . Warden William Smithers , report to Level A conference room . Mellow greetings , Warden William Smithers . Be well , lieutenant Lenina Huxley . As it is a beautiful Monday morning , and as my ... duty log irrationally required it , I 'm hereby querying you on the prison population update . Does the tedium continue ? Your questioning is as amusing as it is irrelevant . The prisoners are ice cubes . They never move . I find this lack of stimulus to be truly disappointing . - Don 't you think ? - I try not to . However , you 're young . Think all you want . Things don 't happen anymore . We 've taken care of all that . I 'll Fiber Op you back after the morning parole hearings . Have a peachy day , lieutenant . Be well . Be well . Vector 137 . Upcoming , Santa Monica Boulevard . Retina coding accepted , Warden William Smithers . Be well . Go on . - Self-drive on . - Self-drive engaged . Huxley , Lenina coding on . No police presence is requested in the city at this time . Report to the station . Oh , boy , how exciting . That 's it . Food , glorious food . There 'll be another one in about 12 hours . These assholes are nothing if not predictable . God , I love to hate this place . - There 's not enough of us , Friendly . - That doesn 't really matter anymore , Daddy Call . People are hungry . We got nothing left to lose . - Greetings , Erwin . - Lovely Lenina . Greetings and salutation . Welcome to the emergency line of the San Angeles Police Department . If you 'd prefer an automated response , press 1 now . Be well , lieutenant . - Mellow greetings , Lenina Huxley . - Lemme guess . All is serene ? On the contrary , it 's been a horrific a.m. There was a defacement of public buildings . Walls smudged with ... - scandalous graffiti . - Really ? Brutal . Why wasn 't there an all-cars notified ? Because there was no need to create widespread panic . Lieutenant Huxley ... I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments to the warden this morning . Do you really long for chaos and disharmony ? Your fascination with the vulgar 20th century seems to be affecting your better judgment . You realize you 're setting a bad example for other officers and sworn personnel . Thank you for the attitude readjustment , chief Earle . Info assimilated . Sanctimonious asshole . Lenina Huxley , you are fined one half credit for a sotto voce violation of the verbal morality statute . Thank you . Phew , that was tense . - That was tense ? - Yes . Tell me something , Garcia . Don 't you get bored code-tracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes ? Actually , no , I find my job deeply fulfilling . I just ... cannot get over the reality of this office , Lenina Huxley . You 're still addicted to the 20th century . High from its harshness . Buzzed by its brutality . Holy smokes ! I mean , is there anything in this office which doesn 't violate Contraband Ordinance 22 ? Only you , Alfredo Garcia . Don 't you ever want something to happen ? Goodness , no . I knew you were gonna say that . What I wouldn 't give for some action . Mr. Simon Phoenix . One of our first and most illustrious members . Allow me to ... welcome you to your parole hearing . Let 's get this one over quick . Twenty-nine years ago , the parole system as you know it ... was rendered obsolete . Federal Statute 537-29 ... Stop it ! Do you have anything fresh to say on your behalf ? I thought not . Yeah , I do . Teddy bear . How 'd you know the password to the cuffs ? I wish I knew . Simon says , die . Yoo-hoo !

Wonder if I can play the accordion too . File code accepted . Friendly , Edgar . Code level : 60 . Listed offences : civil unrest ... . Don 't you hear a thought repeating in that brain of yours ? The name Friendly , Edgar ? Edgar Friendly . Don 't you have a job to do ? Don 't you have someone to kill ? Someone to kill . Someone to kill . Someone to kill . " Gun " , noun . Portable firearm . This device was widely utilized in the urban wars of the late 20th century . Referred to as a " pistol " ... Look , I don 't need a history lesson . Come on , HAL . Where are the goddamn guns ? You are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute . Fuck you . Your repeated violation of the verbal morality statute has caused me to notify the San Angeles Police Department . Please , remain where you are for your reprimand . Yeah , right . Fuckers are fast too . You are fined one credit for violation of the verbal morality statute . ProtectServe in place . Four minutes , 15 seconds lapse . Maniac is imminent . Request advice . With a firm tone of voice , demand maniac lie down with hands behind back . Simon Phoenix ! Lie down with your hands behind your back ! What 's this ? Six of you . Such nice tidy uniforms . Oh , I 'm so scared . What , you guys don 't have sarcasm anymore ? Maniac has responded with a scornful remark . Approach and repeat ultimatum in an even firmer tone of voice . Add the words " or else " . Simon Phoenix ! Lie down on the ground ... or else ! Anti-Graffiti Activation Program activated . Aborted . Human presence detected . Safety override code accepted . Lucky number seven . Okay . Ole ! Did you see that ? We 're police officers . We 're not trained to handle this kind of violence . Hey , wait for me ! - Go . - Run away . Save yourself . Come on . Stupid . Simon says ... everybody ... stay ! And the home of the brave . Play ball ! We 've lost every camera for six blocks . Go to Century City , 1200 millimeters . He 's going for the vehicle 's battery coil . It 's pure capacitance gel . The problem is not the defacement of public buildings or the noise pollution caused by the exploding devices . Allow me to explain . The real problem lies in the man whose initials mark the detonating graffiti on the streets of our peaceful city . The man behind the E.F. : Mr. Edgar Friendly . For a sadly extended period of time , we in San Angeles have been plagued by a pack of subterranean hooligans . You will come to know them as " scraps " . Men and women who have left the comfort of our society only to spew hostility at the very bosom that they have relinquished . There was a time when we used to look upon these scraps as ... rather pathetic and relatively harmless . Now they have a leader . Mr. Friendly seems relentless in his ambition to infect our harmony with his venom . He must , of course , be stopped . This radical terrorist behavior , led by Mr. Friendly , must not be allowed to undermine our safety . Safety above all . I expect your trust , confidence and certitude . If you 'll excuse me . Dr. Cocteau , a CryoCon has effected self-release from the penitentiary . It 's quite horrific . MurderDeathKills , all categories of chaos . Enhance your calm . Enhance your ... " Be well " them for me . Get me captain George Earle immediately . It was just ... . I mean , it was so ... How can a man be so blatantly sadistic ? It was fun for him . I want you to do everything in your power to snare this agent of destruction . You have my utmost confidence . It will be done , dr . Cocteau . Be well . " Utmost confidence . " " Everything in our power . " What else is there ? Zachary Lamb ... how was the fiendish Simon Phoenix apprehended back in the 20th ? Twelve-state manhunt . Satellite surveillance . A video bite on " Unsolved Mysteries " . Heh , none of them worked . In the end , it took just one man . One cop . - John Spartan . - John Spartan ? That 's right . They called him the Demolition Man . Spartan file 98345 , L.A.P.D. Spartan file 98761 C , L.A.P.D. - Are you sure this is real life ? - Barely . Spartan is a legend . I 've been doing a historical study . Over 1000 arrests over three years . All authentic criminals . There was a lot more business back then . How can you justify destroying a 7-million-dollar mini mall to rescue a girl whose ransom is only 25,000 dollars ? Fuck you , lady . Good answer . This is your recommendation ? The Demolition Man 's an animal . He 's clearly the man for a job such as this . You could reinstate him . He 's a musclebound grotesque who hasn 't worn a shield in 40 years . Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal . We need an old-fashioned cop . Cryo plugs 312 and 618 are vacant and ready for routine maintenance and inspection . Transporting cryoprisoner Spartan , John B. to the MTL . Got it . Okay . John Spartan , 5864 . Pulmonary activity approaching normal . Body temperature , 63 percent and rising . Biolink engaged . Laser defibrillation sequence started . Plasma transfer in 15 seconds . Plasma transfer , 10 seconds ... eight seconds ... six seconds ... . Plasma transfer ... complete . MTL complete . Hunting down an escaped CryoCon by releasing another one ? I am unconvinced . This is within the powers of the police charter , sir . He can be released on limited parole and reinstated to active duty . It 's not enough to collect the ' 90s , you have to bring them back to life ? Dr. Cocteau said everything within our power . I can 't think of a better idea . That still doesn 't mean it 's a good one . This man comes from a dissimilar method of law enforcement . I 'm not sure he 's any different than Simon Phoenix himself . Detective ? Detective , I am lieutenant Lenina Huxley . The year is 2032 . - Now , the reason you have been released is ... - How long have I been under ? Thirty-six years . I had a wife . What happened to my wife ? Her light was extinguished in the Big One of 2010 . Um ... she died . In an earthquake . The earthquake . I had a daughter . I made a promise . What happened to her ? John Spartan , I am Chief of Police George Earle . We didn 't thaw you out for a family reunion . Consider it fortunate the lieutenant even bothered to do a probe on your wife . This is about you and the CryoCon Simon Phoenix . What ? This morning , Simon Phoenix escaped from this cryo facility . We 've had 11 MurderDeathKills so far . You see , we have become a society of peace , loving and ... and understanding and we are , quite frankly , not equipped to deal with this situation . There have been no deaths of unnatural causes in San Angeles in the last 16 years . Where ? The Santa Barbara-Los Angeles-San Diego Metroplex were merged in 2011 . You are in the center of what used to be Los Angeles . That 's great . - You , get me a Marlboro . - Yes , of course . Right away . What 's a ... a Marlboro ? It 's a cigarette . Any cigarette . Uh , smoking is not good for you . And it 's been deemed that anything not good for you ... is bad . Hence , illegal . Alcohol , caffeine , contact sports , meat ... Are you shittin ' me ? John Spartan , you are fined one credit for violation of the verbal morality statute . What the hell is that ? - John Spartan , you are fined one credit ... . - Bad language chocolate , gasoline , uneducational toys and anything spicy . Abortion is also illegal , but then again so is pregnancy if you don 't have a license . Caveman ... let 's finish with all the Rip Van Winkle and get moving . A Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes . Uh-huh . I tracked that dirtbag for two years and when I finally bring ' im down , you turn me into an ice cube for my trouble . Thanks , but no , thanks . The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the S.A.P.D. and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix . Or ... you can go back into cryostasis . Not many people get a second chance , John Spartan . - Here you go . - Will do . - Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix ? - There is nothing , Lenina Huxley . Where 's your John Spartan ? Oh , he went to the bathroom . I-I guess he got all thawed out . Oh . Sir , I formally convey my presence . How you doin ' ? We are not used to physical-contact greetings . Oh , germs . Look , I don 't know if you guys know it , but you 're ... you 're out of toilet paper . Did-did you say toilet paper ? Oh . They used handfuls of wadded paper back in the 20th . I 'm happy that you 're happy , but the place where you 're supposed to have the toilet paper ... you got this little shelf with three seashells on it . He doesn 't know how to use the three seashells . I can see how that could be confusing . I don 't believe it . Is that you , Spartan ? No ! Zach ? Zach Lamb ? What happened to you ? I got older . My God , I remember when you were a snot-nosed rookie pilot . They finally grounded me . Shit , you were a damn good flyer . You are fined two credits for violation of the verbal morality statute . I 'll be right back . They seem to be friends , yet he speaks to him in the most profane manner . Well , if you had read my study , you would know this is how insecure heterosexual males used to bond . I knew that . Thanks a lot , you shit-brained , fuck-faced , ball-breaking ... - duck-fucking pain in the ass . - You 're fined five credits ... for repeated violations of the verbal morality statute . So much for the seashells . See you in a few minutes . Waiting for command . Voice check , Lenina Huxley . Unfortunately , Simon Phoenix was not coded . While you were sleeping , everyone in the city was installed code . It was a brilliant idea by dr . Cocteau that an organically bioengineered microchip be sewn into the skin . Sensors all over the city can zero in on anyone at any time . I can 't even conceive a visual what you police officers did before it was developed . We worked for a livin ' . This fascist crap makes me wanna puke . What do you think you 're scratching , caveman ? You really think we 'd let you go without control ? Your code was implanted the second you thawed . Why don 't you just shove a leash up my ass ? - You dirty meat-eater ! - You are fined ... . No matter how Viking your era was , I cannot digest how you ever wore a badge . You 're going back , John Spartan . Oh , yes , you 're going back . Could you two please dump some hormones ? We need every cortex we can get in this situation . We don 't need the Neanderthal . Our computer has already examined every feasible scenario resulting from the appearance of Simon Phoenix . It is determined he will attempt to set up a new drug lab and form a crime syndicate . That is correct , chief George Earle . Look , I hate to interrupt you two lovebirds , but that 's really fucking stupid . You think he wants to start a business ? Phoenix is going for a gun , plain and simple . Trust me . He 's going for a gun . Who cares what this primate thinks ? Resonate some understanding . The only place a person can even view a gun in this city is ... at a museum . Welcome to the San Angeles Museum of History . Beneath you , you will see an excavation ... - of an actual 20th-century street scene ... - Hey , hey ! All right . - ... in downtown Los Angeles ... - Now , good . ... preserved since the earthquake of 2010 . For specific information concerning objects featured in the exhibit ... . Firearms are on display in the Armory . ... located on Level A. You are now entering the Hall of Violence , a visual representation of the primitive behavior prevalent during the late 20th century . Home , sweet home . Ooh . John Spartan , even if Simon Phoenix was able to locate the cache of firearms , it would ... it would be impossible for him to remove them . She 's right . They 're located in a maximum-security armory exhibit . It 's just a hunch , so trust me on this . It 's a cop thing . And what am I , a frog ? - Excuse me . - Yes ? - I 'll drive . - I see . Resetting all bio-links for new driver . Weight , height , peripheral vision set . If you would like to commence transportation , John Spartan , initialize sequence now . You drive . Welcome , lieutenant Lenina Huxley . You seem very much alone , John Spartan , but ... things aren 't all that different . Perhaps you 'd like to hear an oldies station ? Oldies ? Oh , this is the most popular station in town . Wall-to-wall mini-tunes . You called them " commercials " . Here 's that classic you 've all been waiting for . The number one request of the day , " Armor Hot Dogs " . Yes ! ... eat Armour Hot Dogs ... Oh , wow . This is my fave . ... skinny kids , kids who climb on rocks Tall kids , sissy kids Even kids with chicken pox love hot dogs Armour Hot Dogs The dogs kids ... love ... to ... bite . Somebody put me back in the fridge . You are now entering the armory exhibit . You will find displayed in the cabinets and walls ... So sorry . Didn 't see you there . ... various weapons used for violent life termination ... - in wars and urban disturbances ... - Sweet baby . - ... during the 19th and 20th centuries . - Oh , shit . You are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute . Yes . Now , this is what I 'm talkin ' about . How do you get in here ? Hey , hey . I gotta wait that 15-day waiting period , or can I just take one now ? Motherfucker . Fuck it . Mellow greetings . What seems to be your boggle ? My boggle ? How much do you weigh ? Well , I happen to weigh ... Please , vacate the museum , patrons . Be calm . Please , vacate the museum , patrons . Be calm . Wait a minute . This is the future . Where are all the phaser guns ? Ah . Mellow greetings , sir . What 's your boggle ? Please , exit rapidly . Warning . Please , exit rapidly . The magnetic accelerator gun the last produced handheld weapon of this millennium displaced the flow of neutrons through a nonlinear cycloid electromagnetic accumulator . So , what ? What , what ? It needs batteries ? What size ? I mean , where ... where the fuck do you find batteries in the future ? Is there a battery store around , motherfucker ? Excuse me , Elysian patron . Can I ... ? Well , where 's the Radio Shack ? Whoo ! Sweet music to my ears . When activated , the magnetic accelerator gun will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes . Yeah , well , I was thinkin ' about leavin ' quickly . Patience is not one of my virtues . Did you see that ? What ? Never mind . I give up trying to figure this place out . Excuse me , Rambo . I need to borrow this . Access and correlate procedure . Establish communication with maniac intruder . Wrong . - Hey , Luke Skywalker , use the Force . - Oh , dear . - Hey , what the hell is this ? - It 's a glow-rod . It 's what we got . - Does it work ? - Well , um ... Guess so . They have him trapped in section 8 . I doubt it , Huxley . Now , make sure that building 's clear . Done . I want a visual . Now ! Every corridor of the museum . I want full sensors routed to me - and I want it 90 seconds ago . - Hm . You guys wait here . Give me 10 minutes . Patron , you are now confined to the armory . Museum patron , you are now confined to the armory . The armory exhibit is now sealed . All museum patrons still occupying the facility should remain calm . Help is imminent . This museum is no longer sealed , is it ? What can I say ? I 'm a blast from the past . You should 've stayed there . Oh , boy , that voice sounds familiar . Who is that ? Bad aim , blondie . Spartan ? John Spartan ? Aw , shit , they let anybody into this century . What the hell are you doin ' here ? Simon says , bleed ! Great . Just great . You 're makin ' it too easy for me , Phoenix . Come on , you space-age piece o ' shit . Now , let me get this right . They defrosted you just so you could lasso my piddly ass ? Damn , you been had . I 've been dreamin ' about killin ' you for 40 years . Yeah ? Well , keep dreaming . Ooh , wow ! Oh , shit ! Acc-Mag now reactivated . It 's about time . Past is over , John . Time for something new and improved . Oh , hell . Holy shit ! I love this gun ! Goddamn ! How do you like me in the future , John , huh ? Come on , Phoenix . Come on ! Oh , I know that must have hurt . Huh , soldier boy ? - You 're on TV . - Oh , shit ! You 're dead , Spartan . Forgot to say , " Simon says " . Oh , shit . Good one . Such a brave new world . Sorry you gotta go . Shit . Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans . Someone will pay dearly for this . Sir , the stress breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak . Shit . Being frozen must have thrown my aim off . Don 't worry , I 'll get you with the next shot . I don 't think so . No kiss-kiss , no bang-bang . And you were doing so well . Now , don 't you have a job to do ? Hm ? Isn 't there a thought repeating in that barbaric brain of yours ? The name Friendly . Mr. Edgar Friendly . Don 't you have someone to kill ? - Yeah , I do . - Excellent . Then go and do your job . Phoenix ! Shit . Saved by the bell . Shit . Damn . You don 't know how lucky you are that man couldn 't you . Well , I must say that whacking , whatever it is , sounds most disagreeable . Well , you scared him away . I ... I don 't know how to thank you . You ... saved my life . No problem . Not bad for a 74-year-old . Simon Phoenix knows he has some competition . He 's finally matched his meat . You really licked his ass . That 's " met his match " and " kicked ... kicked his ass " . Met ? " Met his match and kicked his ass . " Captain Earle . Who is this man ? Detective John Spartan , temporarily reinstated to the San Angeles Police Department to pursue the escaped CryoCon Simon Phoenix . You told us to do everything in our power to capture the mad man . Oh , yes . Yes , I did . I did . Yes , I do recall the exploits of Mr. John Spartan . Yes . Didn 't they call him ... ? Yes , of course . The Demolition Man . It 's quite all right , chief . Unexpected . Creative . But quite all right . John Spartan , welcome . Now , in honor of your arrival and your protection of the sanctity of human life , namely my own , I would like to invite you to join me to dinner tonight . The both of you . Please , I insist . I would like you to accompany me ... to Pizza Hut . Look forward to it . Thank you . - Pizza Hut ? - Yes . So let me get this right : Spacely Sprockets here , who 's now the man in charge , the mayor / gov who wants to take me to dinner at Pizza Hut ... Though Lord know I wouldn 't mind a pizza . ... is also one of the guys that built the goddamn cryoprison ? - John Spartan , you are fined one credit ... . - Thanks . Dr. Cocteau is the most important man in San Angeles . He practically created our whole way of life , savage . Yeah ? Well , he can have it . Now , Phoenix could be anywhere , but not being coded could hurt ' im and limit his options . That is correct . Money is outmoded . All transactions are through codes . Now , so he can 't buy food or a place to stay for the night . It 'd be a waste o ' time to mug somebody . Unless he rips off someone 's hand . Let 's hope he doesn 't figure that one out . But with all officers already patrolling in a citywide crisis net it should be just a matter of tick-tocks before ... More importantly , we already have a backup plan . We can just wait for another code to go red . And when Phoenix performs another MurderDeathKill ... we 'll know exactly where to pounce . - Great plan . - Thank you . He likes your plan , chief . I 've been an enthusiast of your escapades for quite some time now . I have in fact perused some newsreels from the Schwarzenegger Library . That time that he took that car ... Hold it . The Schwarzenegger Library ? Yes , the Schwarzenegger Presidential Library . Wasn 't he an actor when ... ? - Stop . He was president ? - Yes . Even though he was not born in this country , his popularity at the time caused the 61st Amendment , which states ... I don 't wanna know . President . What the hell is this ? What , no door ? No welcome mat ? What is this ? What kind of people are these ? How do they expect you to kill somebody ? Oh , shit , I love that smell . Reminds me of biscuits and gravy . All right . A job is a job . Edgar Friendly , whoever the fuck you are , prepare for Simon Phoenix . So , what 's with this Cocteau guy anyway ? He says I saved his life , which I 'm not even sure I did . And my reward is dinner and dancing at Pizza Hut ? I mean , hey , I like a big fat piece of pizza , but come on . Your tone is quasi-facetious , but ... you do not realize that Pizza Hut was the only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars . So ? So ... now all restaurants are Pizza Hut . No way . Welcome to Pizza Hut . Enjoy your meal , sir . Be well . I 'll take that . Oh . Here comes the Neanderthal . Mr. Spartan , over there , please , and lieutenant ... . Thank you . Would you , uh ... ? - Yes . - Hi . - How are you guys doing ? - Mellow , thank you . Fine . Yes . Enjoy-joy your meal , sir . It 's good thing I 'm hungry . Ladies and gentlemen , I 'm going to ask you to raise your glasses ... to the hero of the hour , my savior ... detective John Spartan . John Spartan . Appreciate it . Greetings and salutations . I 'm Associate Bob . We met before , ever so briefly . I was , uh , groveling in fear at the time . You got the salt over there , Bob ? Um , salt is not good for you , hence it is ille ... So , John Spartan , tell me ... what do you think of San Angeles , 2032 ? Well , considering the way things were going when I went in , I thought the future would be a writhing cesspool . Well , you weren 't here when the real disturbances began . Civilization tried to destroy itself . The city degenerated into a total fear zone . The citizenry cocooned in their homes , afraid to go out . People just wanted the madness over . So , when I saw the chance to make things right , I seized it . If I had not , the radiance of San Angeles would not be here . Just your rotting cesspool of hate and suffering . Which would you prefer ? Maybe you can book me a flight outta here when the sermon 's over . John Spartan ... for your crimes , you would surely have died in jail before now . Even you must appreciate the persuasively tranquil humanity of the cryoprison system . I don 't wanna spoil your dinner , pal , but my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby . I had feelings and I had thoughts . How ' bout a 36-year nightmare about people caught in a burning building ? You were awake ? I don 't think so . I do think so . And my wife beating her fists against a block of ice that used to be her husband . Then , you were nice enough to wake me up and let me know everything that meant something in my life is gone . It would have been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the fucking crows . What would you say if I called you a brutish fossil ... symbolic of a decayed era gratefully forgotten ? I don 't know . " Thanks " ? I ... I thought during rehabilitation the prisoners were not conscious . A person would go insane . The side effects of the cryo process are unavoidable . You were found guilty of criminal charges . You owed and still do owe a debt to society . - I 'm sorry , there 's nothing I can do . - Yeah , there is . - Call for backup . I 'll be across the street . - But Spartan , where-where-where are you going ? Bad guys about to do bad things . It 's just one of those hunches again . - Come on . - Go for the truck . The food 's in the truck . Grab the big bottle . Come on , move , move , move . You 're gonna regret this the rest of your life . Both seconds of it . Good night . Get ' im ! What a fucking hero . Come on . Please , don 't . What the hell ? Such reckless abandonment . Looks like there 's a new shepherd in town . That 's " sheriff " . Who were those guys ? They 're known as scraps . Outcasts and deserters who choose to live beneath us in sewers and abandoned tunnels . They 're a constant irritation to our harmony . They 're nothing but thugs and hooligans . A society of thieves . The last remaining criminal element in the city . But plans are in progress to purge this peril from our day . You are even better live than on LaserDisc . And the joy-joy the way you paused to make a glib witticism before doing battle with that strangely weaponed scrap , and that row of pun ... Huxley , look , this isn 't the Wild West , okay ? The Wild West wasn 't even the Wild West . Hurting people 's not a good thing . Well , sometimes it is , but not when it 's a bunch o ' people lookin ' for something to eat . San Angeles time is now 22 : 15 . Huxley coding off . Auto-drive . Auto-drive engaged . Look , I 'm sorry I yelled at you back there . No need to make a de-hurtful retraction . I 've just assimilated too much contraband . I fleshed you out as some " blow up the bad guy with a happy grin " He-Man type . But now I realize that you 're the " moody troubled-past gunslinger who will only draw when he must " type . - Huxley , stop . - What ? I 'm not any of that . I just do my job and things get get demolished . You know , I keep looking around and I think about my daughter growing up in a place like this . And I 'm afraid she 's gonna think I 'm some kind of primitive . I mean , as much as I wanna see her , I almost don 't wanna . Because I don 't think I 'm gonna fit into the picture very well . Not very well at all . It would be a minor misuse of police powers , but I ... I could do a search for you . No . Sorry . Oh , subject change . I got what you wanted . Oh , great . What do you need that for ? It 's just one of those cop hunches again . Lights . No . I 've changed that . Illuminate . Deluminate . Whoo ! Isn 't that nicer ? Go ahead , you try it . Illuminate . Raymond , Raymond , we gotta talk . How did you get in ? Wish I knew . I got pass codes ... Routes to underground kingdoms ... Complete access to the ... industrial data-grid interface . I don 't even know what that shit means . But I been meanin ' to ask you , buddy , because I like it . I like it a lot . Your skills were given to you for a reason . Not for your personal amusement . Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly and stop a revolution before it precipitates . That was why you were rehabilitated . All right . I 'm gonna do your little dastardly deed for you . But it 's gonna be a little bit more difficult than you thought . And I 'm gonna need some help . I 'll need about five or six ... more special men . And I just so happen to have a list . You see , I wouldn 't want you to defrost any of those mad-dog killer types , you know what I mean ? And none of them motherfuckers from New York . They 're too uptight . So you 're going to be the only mad-dog killer type , right ? Exactamundo . Fine . Take care of it . Just get it over with . You 're beginning to be more trouble than you 're worth . Oh , Raymond , don 't say that . And what do I get outta all this ? What do you want ? Malibu . Santa Monica . Hell , what about all the coastal cities ? Very well , I 'll bear it in mind . - Good , I 'll send you a memo . - Just do your job ! What is John Spartan doin ' here ? Huh ? Did you invite ' im to this little party of ours ? Look , you finish your business and I 'll stuff him back in the freezer . Think of him as a guarantee . A guarantee ? Well , you don 't have much of a guarantee . I took care of Spartan once , I 'll take care of him again . Now we need those men defrosted . So this is where you live , Huxley ? Very not bad . Thank you . So , where will I be staying ? Oh , I 've procured you a domicile right down the corridor from my own . Everything is voice coded , so if you need something , just ask . Lights . What do you think ? Clicked off a lot of credits to create a 20th-century apartment . Uh , Huxley , it 's very ... . Isn 't it ? John Spartan ... there is , of course , a ... well-known and documented connection between sex and violence . Not so much a causal effect , but a general state of ... of neurological arousal . And ... after having observed your behavior this evening and ... my resultant condition ... um ... I was wondering if you would like to have sex . - With you ? - Mm-hm . - Here ? Now ? - Mm-hm . Oh , yeah . Great ! I 'll be right back . " Love Boat " ? Okay . There you go . Now , just relax . We 'll begin in a few seconds . - Begin what ? - Having sex , of course . Yes . Yes . Yes ! What 's wrong ? You broke contact . Contact ? I didn 't even touch you yet . But I thought you wanted to make love . Is that what you call this ? Vir-sex has been proven to produce high orders of alpha waves during digitized transference of sexual energies . All right , Huxley , what do you say we just do it the old-fashioned way ? Ew ! Disgusting ! You mean ... fluid transfer ? No , I mean ... boning , the wild mambo , the-the hunka-chunka ... That is no longer done . Exchange of bodily fluids , do you know what that leads to ? Yeah , I do . Kids , smoking , a desire to raid the fridge ... The rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one of the major reasons for the downfall of society . After AIDS , there was NRS . After NRS , there was UBT . And one of the first things that dr . Cocteau was able to do was to outlaw and behaviorly engineer all fluid transfer out of societally acceptable behavior . Not even ... not even mouth transfer is condoned . - Kissing 's not allowed ? - Ugh ! Damn , I was a good kisser . All right . What about kids ? - Procreation ? - Yeah . We go to a lab . Fluids are purified , screened and-and transferred by authorized medical personnel only . It is the only legal way . What are you doing ? Breaking the law . You are a savage creature , John Spartan . And I wish you to leave my domicile now . Look , you know ... Code accepted . Be well , John Spartan . Lights . " Oh , he doesn 't know how to use the three seashells . " Happy Halloween . " Behavioral engineering " ? Hi , Martin , you know , I was thinking ... Oh , my God , I 'm sorry , wrong number . Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans . Someone will pay dearly for this . Sir , the stress breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak . Shit . Being frozen must have thrown my aim off . Don 't worry , I 'll get you with the next shot . I don 't think so . No kiss-kiss , no bang-bang . - Detective . - Listen , I 'm sorry about last night . Here , I made this for you . - For me ? - Yeah . Thank you . Oh , I 'll drive . - I gotta learn to do this once in my life . - Okay . Thank you for the lovely gift . Look , I don 't know what you guys put into my cryo sludge , but when I thawed out , the first thing I wanted to do was knit . I mean , how come I know what a zipperfoot , and-and a shuttle , and a hooking ' bobbin and a petit point is ? I could weave a throw rug right now with my eyes closed . It 's part of your rehab program . For each inmate , the computer draws up a skill or trade that 's best suited to their genetic disposition . And it would implant the knowledge and the desire to carry out whatever ... training was assigned . I 'm a seamstress ? Oh , that 's just great . I come out of cryoprison and I 'm Betsy fucking Ross . And Phoenix comes out and he can access computers , operate all vehicles , knows the location of every damn thing in town and is three time stronger than when he went in ? - Can you get me his rehab program now ? - Sure . - I 'm a seamstress . - Access code for Simon Phoenix . Access Simon Phoenix . Accessing . Access denied . - What ? - Security override . This can 't be right . Access granted , officer Huxley . Accessing Simon Phoenix , Deepfile rehab 65-R . Urban Combatkill . Torture Methodology . Computer Override Authority . There must be some mistake . Terrorism Tactics . Weapons Training . Martial Arts . MurderDeathKill . Explosives Technician . Violent Behavior . - This isn 't a proper rehabilitation program . - No kiddin ' . This would create a monster . - Who develops these programs ? - Well , Cocteau Industries , of course . But why would the benevolent dr . Cocteau send such a brute savage into our midst ? Ah , that 's a good question . Why don 't we go ask ' im . No , John . You do not accuse a savior of our city of being connected with a ... multi-MurderDeathKiller like Simon Phoenix. lt 's ... rude . I 'll be subtle . I 'm good at subtle . Mellow greetings . We are happy to welcome you to the Cocteau Behavioral Engineering Complex . Be well . - Enhance your calm , John Spartan . - Mm . Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition , detective , but I do have an entire city / gov to run . Then , well , run this . You programmed Phoenix 's rehab to turn him into a terrorist . And I don 't think his escape was an accident either . - Very subtle . - Thank you . Outside the museum , why didn 't he blow your brains out ? What did you say to him ? I honestly don 't remember . Does it matter ? Yeah , it matters . I saw the security disk . He had a full 10 seconds to figure out where to put the hole in your fucking head . John Spartan . This display of barbaric behavior was unacceptable even in your time . Yeah . But it worked . When a man like Phoenix has a gun to your head ... 10 seconds is 9 and a half seconds longer than you live . Not everyone is as eager as you to resort to violence to solve all the difficulties in life . Even now , I 'm beginning to wonder if the chaos in the museum was the result of Mr. Phoenix 's presence or your own . Wonder about this , shithead . If you think you got this maniac under control , trust me , you don 't . Is there something specific you plan to do with that archaic device ? John Spartan . No , I didn 't think so . Detective , the only thing I haven 't got under control is you . But that can be solved . You , my Cro-Magnon friend , are dead . Your family 's dead , your past is dead . Dead things cannot affect the living . So ... enjoy your moment of ... prehistoric bravado because after you leave here , it will be over . Like everything else in your life . Officer , return this man to cryostasis immediately . Be well . Be fucked . John Spartan , you are fined one ... Greetings , citizen . How are you on this glorious day ? - I 'll wait here . - Let 's go . - Oh , I don 't know . - Look , I do know . Now turn that thing on . - I hope you know what you 're doing . - Vector , 23 degrees . But you 're asking me to disobey a direct order . I 'm to escort you to the cryoprison . Look , you do what you gotta do . I know what I gotta do . I gotta nail that maniac and put ' im on ice or that 's where I 'm gonna be . - Enhance your calm , John Spartan . - Look , I 've had it with enhancing my calm . I 'm gonna find that psycho Phoenix and enhance his calm . And when I 'm done , I 'm gonna turn all my attention to that Froot Loop , Cocteau . Now , you don 't have to come with me . I can do this alone . Okay ? Even if Simon Phoenix was programmed to escape , extinguish life and steal contraband weapons , why are you proceeding into the depth of the wasteland ? The reason why your city-wide manhunt didn 't work was because Phoenix was in the one place that A - you can 't monitor , B - are afraid to go and , C - don 't give a shit about . Now , I wanna go down there , I wanna find Phoenix and I wanna put ' im in a hurt locker . So , you wanna come with me ... or you wanna arrest me , huh ? Okay . I 'm with you . Let 's go blow this guy . Away . Blow this guy away . Whatever . She got a way with words . - What 's wrong , Huxley ? - It 's not very clean . A real garden sight . All right , which way go I say ? Over there . All right , guys , be ready for anything . My dog 's better than your dog My dog 's better than yours My dog 's better ' cause he gets Ken-L Ration My dog 's ... Hey . I 'm sorry , but when I 'm nervous , I ... . Sorry . O-over here . Oh , what is that emanation ? Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah ! Come on , guys . No , hey , just relax . All I want 's a burger and a beer , if you got one . How am I gonna pay ? Hm ... - Huxley , it is better to give . - Ow ! - You want a slug ? - Ugh . No , thank you . I think I 'm gonna be sick . Oh , God . - This is fantastic . You guys gotta try this . - Oh , my . Just don 't ask where the meat comes from . Huxley , what 's that supposed to mean ? Do you see any cows around here , detective ? Rat ? This is a rat burger ? Not bad . Matter of fact , it 's the best burger I 've had in years . See you later . They don 't seem very hostile , John Spartan . No , they don 't . Now , that 's a thing of beauty . Huxley , do you know what this is ? A 1970 Oldsmobile 442 ! With a 455-cubic-inch engine . Radial tires and-and bucket seats . - I 'm impressed . - I studied . So did I. Hand over the glow-rod . Your friends too . Come on , move . Ow ! - Easy , pal . - Yeah . Ow ! You got ball-balls , cop , comin ' down here after the show you put on . We 're looking for a MurderDeathKiller . Can you help or just bully us with your primitive weapons ? Well , maybe they 're not so primitive . So , you think you 're takin ' me in , huh ? Guess what . Not happening ' . You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass . Yeah , that 's right . You tell Cocteau it 's gonna take an army of assholes to get rid of me . Cause I don 't give a shit . I got nothin ' to lose . I don 't wanna rain on your parade , pal . But I don 't know who the hell you are , let alone wanna take you anywhere . So , stay here , be well and Cocteau 's an asshole ! - Hey ! - Hey , man . Let 's take ' em and dump ' em up top . They 're only down here to spy on us . Wait a minute . You 're the guy outside Pizza Hut . Yeah . What do you want ? I guess you weren 't part of the Cocteau plan . Greed , deception , abuse of power . That 's no plan . - That 's why everybody 's down here ? - Got that right . See , according to Cocteau 's plan ... I 'm the enemy , cause I like to think . I like to read . I 'm into freedom o ' speech and freedom o 'choice . I 'm the kind o ' guy who just sits in a greasy spoon and wonders : " Gee ! Should I have the T-bone steak " " or the jumbo rack of barbecued ribs on the side or the gravy fries ? " I want high cholesterol . I wanna eat bacon , and butter and buckets o ' cheese , okay ? I wanna smoke a Cuban cigar the size of Cincinnati in a non-smokin ' section . I wanna run through the streets naked with green Jell-O all over my body reading ' " Playboy " magazine . And why ? Because I suddenly might feel the need to . Okay , pal ? I 've seen the future . You know what it is ? It 's a 47-year-old virgin sitting ' around in his beige pyjamas , drinkin a banana-broccoli shake , singin ' " I 'm a Oscar Meyer wiener " . You live up top , you live Cocteau 's way . What he wants , when he wants , how he wants . You 're outta choice ? Come down here ... Maybe starve to death . All right . Then why don 't you take charge and lead these people out of here ? I 'm no leader . I do what I have to do . Sometimes people come with me . All I wanna do is bury Cocteau up to his neck in shit and let ' im think happy thoughts forever . Then I got bad news . I think he wants to kill you . All right , gentlemen . Let 's review . The year is 2032 . That 's 2-0-3-2 . As in the 21st century . And I am sorry to say that the world has become a pussy-whipped Brady Bunch version of itself , run by a bunch of robed sissies . All we have to do to run the whole thing ... is to kill a man named ... Friendly , who put it all together . Ah , but there 's an extra added bonus . We get to kill the man who put most of us behind the freezer . You mean ... we get to kill John Spartan ? Exactly . I want you to loot , pillage , plunder . I want you to steal . I want you to do all the wonderful things that we used to do before all of this happened . This world will be ours . Let 's bring back the good old days ! - Are you with me ? - Yeah ! - Are you with me ? - Yeah ! - Let 's do it ! - Yeah ! It is a curious conclusion which you have deduced , John Spartan . But ... I can find no fault in your logic . Simon Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send out into the savage nether regions in which we stand . I am impressed , John Spartan . You mean they thawed this guy out just to kill me ? - I 'm flattered . - Don 't be flattered . Be frightened . This guy 's a certifiable nightmare . - And that 's why you 're down here ? - Yeah . I must have done something right in a previous life . Can 't imagine what that coulda been . Two for the price of one . Let 's take ' em , boys . Stay down ! Friendly ! Up on top ! I 'll be goddamned . Like a New York cockroach . Fuck it . I hate when things go wrong . Phoenix ! There 's an elevator shaft on top of this place . - Does that mean we 're going up ? - Momentito , senorita Huxley . Come on . How nice . They must have been expecting me . - Okay . Now what ? - Buckle up . There he is ! He 's in my car ! I 'll be goddamned . What is happenin with the cops today ? Huh ? Don 't you know you 're endangering the lives of civilians ? Shit . - Auto-inflate . - Auto-inflate . Damn ! Oh , that is just lovely . - Huxley , drive . - Okay , okay , I 've read all about this now . Okay . So , what do I do ? I just ... I just push this pedal ? Whoa ! Okay , okay . I got it , I got it . - Punch it , Huxley ! - Excuse me ? Push the pedal as hard as you can ! Just catch up to ' im ! - Hold on . - Faster ! Faster ! Shit . No free rides ! - Emergency , doors open . - Doors opening . Say hello to my little friend . - Doors close . - Malfunction . Computer , auto-drive . Auto-drive engaged . Gonna give you a haircut ! Remember those 40 bus passengers that you blew apart tryin ' to catch me ? They were already dead . Cold as Haagen-Dazs . Man , I went to jail with a 36-year smile . You 're dead , Spartan . Speak for yourself . - Self-drive . - Unable to execute . - Self-drive now . - Malfunction . Unable to execute . Emergency . Go left . Right . Self-drive engaged . Brake ! Brake ! Brake now , you Mickey Mouse piece o ' shiiit ! John Spartan ? John Spartan , are you in there ? - John Spartan ! - Who do you think it is , Huxley ? Here . I thought your life force had been prematurely terminated . Yeah , I thought I was history too . What the hell happened ? All of a sudden ... this car turned into a cannoli . It 's securefoam , and it saved your life . Look at you , you 're in shambles . Don 't worry , I can fix it later . All I need is a needle and thread . I really didn 't say that , did I ? Damn ! John Spartan . You ... You caveman , you 're under arrest . You are to be returned to the cryoprison immediately . I heard all about that . We 'll talk later , chief . Right now I need something , anything . A shotgun , a flare gun . Spartan . - Holy shit . - Defensive red alert . Stun batons on . Relax . Well , look at you . You get a bump on the noggin and you think you 're Pancho Villa ? - Who ? - Never mind . Time to take a stand , pal . Well , good . While you 're doing it , loan me a gun . Loan me two guns . You 'd use these weapons of mass destruction against men and women who uphold the law ? We use these weapons to shop for groceries ... dick . Spartan , wait . You can 't leave . You 're under arrest . This very concept negates the possibility of your leaving . Skip it , chief . Lieutenant Huxley . Chief , you can take this job and you can shovel it . Hm ? " Take this job and shovel it . " Yeah ? Close enough . No . No . I hadn 't counted on this , but I must say , you worked out beautifully . People are terrified of you . What 's new ? People have always been terrified of me . Yes , but this time , they 're really intimidated . Now ... I 'll have carte blanche to create the perfect society . My society . San Angeles will be a beacon of order ... with the purity of an ant colony . And the beauty of a flawless pearl . Look , you can 't take away people 's right to be assholes . Hm ? That 's who you remind me of ... an evil Mr. Rogers . Will you please kill him ? He 's pissin ' me off . Put another log on the fire ! I 'm gonna love running ' this place . Well , now ... what shall I do with you , huh , Bobby ? I am an excellent associate , sir . I would be delighted to continue my services during your administration . Ah . That 's the man who we 'll use . Excuse me but the police are here . Who in the hell do you think ... ? I 'm impressed . Huxley ! That man has died by my hands . It was either him or us , Huxley . Yeah , there is that . Anyway , where in the hell did you learn to kick like that ? - Oh , um , Jackie Chan movies . - Ah . Looks like the Cocteau plan just went up in smoke . Rest in peace , Raymond Cocteau . Oh , John Spartan , civilization as we know it will come to an end . What will we do ? I don 't know . But trust me , this is better for you . What 's that ? Oh , this is bad . This is very bad . He 's accessed the cryoprison and he 's about to defrost the entire multi-lifer wing . Most of them don 't like you . Most o ' these guys don 't even like their own mothers . These are bad boys , Huxley . How many are there ? Eighty . All without rehab . And now they 'll be reanimated within the hour . Oh , we gotta stop this . I 'm not at all pleased about having caused the fatality of that deranged CryoCon . But ... I now understand that under certain circumstances , that violence is necessary . Good . Then I hope you understand this . Oh , I hope my butt didn 't look like that . Okay , who do we have left that 's good , huh ? Oh , let 's see . Wilkes , Patrick . Jeffrey Dahmer ? I love that guy . Look , we gotta get ' im . How long before the rest are done ? - They 're in the final stages of reanimation , sir . - Great . Absolutely great . Gentlemen . Thank you very much , but your services will no longer be required . Send a maniac to catch a maniac . Attention . Attention . Cryoprisoner defrosting reanimation sequence now entering final stage . Countdown to reanimation of prisoner batches 290 , 310 , 480 and 570 : Ten minutes . - That 's it . The very last one . - Excellent . Accessed . What the hell is that ? Phoenix ! Didn 't expect that one , did you ? - Where the fuck are you goin ' ? - I wish you the best of luck , sir . Stupid . Spartan , how 's it hangin ' , huh ? I 'm sure you 're familiar with the long arm of the law , aren 't you ? Aw , come on , Spartan . Why don 't you struggle a little bit ? Make me work for it , huh ? What do you say ? How about a little target practice ? What do you say ? Didn 't hurt your head , did you ? Shit . Piece-o ' - shit gun . Damn . Fuck . That 's it , Spartan . You 're not gettin out of this one . I could drop you in that vat of defrost over there and fry your ass like a chicken . Or with my little pinky , drop your monkey ass down ... I 'll be goddamned . Shit ! Goddamn ! What am I doin ' wrong ? Cryoprisoner reanimation sequence now entering final stage . Is it cold in here , or is it just me ? Good memory . Come ' ere . Come ' ere . Piece of shit ! I hate cops ! Look in my eyes , John . I 'll see you in hell . Not . This is the best day of my life . Heads up ! You have apprehended the villain responsible for the murder of our beloved dr . Raymond Cocteau ? Well , I wouldn 't exactly say apprehended . Let 's just say he 's history . And the cryoprison , that 's history too . What will we do ? How will we live ? I 'll tell you what we 're gonna do . We 're gonna go out drinkin ' to all of us , get shit-faced and paint the town , literally . Put up graffiti , slogans ... It 'll be a blast . Whoa , whoa , whoa . I 'm gonna tell you what you 're gonna do . Why don 't you get a little dirty ? You , a lot clean . And somewhere in the middle ... . I don 't know . You 'll figure it out . Fuckin ' A. Well put . Mr. Friendly ? Greetings and salutations , Edgar Friendly . I 'm Associate Bob . And may I say , it would be a pleasure to assist you in creating a more humane ... - Bob . Bob . Let 's talk about the hair , okay ? - Hair ? Pick a color . All right ? And lose the kimono . - You look like a couch . - A couch ? What , are you a surgeon with these gloves ? Thank you for rendering me unconscious . Huxley , I did it for your own good . - We 're supposed to be a team . - We are . Oh , my . Are all fluid-transfer activities like this ? - Better . - Better ? Oh , my . I think I 'm gonna like the future . Now that you 've demolished everything . But there 's just one thing I wanna know . Hm . How 's that damn three-seashell thing work ?

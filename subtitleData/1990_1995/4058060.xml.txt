 ( Metal Clattering ) We 're not ... who ... we are . We 're not ... who we are . It goes no further than this . It stops right here ... right now . ( Gunshots ) Team captainJohn Richter here . It 's been a couple of frustrating months but after a great deal of stick-with-it-ness we 're proud to report that as of a half an hour ago we surpassed the previous record for drilling down into an ice sheet . All : All right ! Mulder : This team of scientists made up the Arctic Ice Core Project . They were sent to Alaska by the government 's advanced research project agency nearly a year ago to drill into the arctic ice . The samples they removed contained trapped gases , dust , chemicals- - Evidence that could reveal the structure of the Earth 's climate back to the dawn of man . Their work was a success , nearly completed . No reports or indications of problems of any kind until only a week later this next transmission was received . We 're not ... who ... we are . We 're not ... who we are . It goes no further than this . It stops ... right here ... right now . ( Groan ) What happened up there ? Nobody 's been able to reach the compound because of bad weather . Obviously they think we 're either brilliant or expendable because we 've pulled the assignment . Is it severe isolation distress ? These were top geophysicists . They were trained and screened for this project in every way imaginable , including psychological makeup . We leave for Nome today . We 'll meet up with three scientists familiar with the project and then head north up to the Icy Cape . The National Weather Service reports a three-day window to get in and get out before the next arctic storm . Bring your mittens . Radio : Fouts looks over the Raiders 'defense . Here 's the snap . Raiders blitz . Fouts dumps it across the middle to Winslow . He 's at the 1 5 ! 1 0 ! Touchdown San Diego ! Touchdown ! Fouts is God ! Sorry . My team scored . There 's no football on Wednesday . Fouts retired in ' 87 , didn 't he ? This is some of my all-time favorite plays on tape . You two F.B.I. ? Agent Mulder , Agent Scully . And you ? Danny Murphy . Professor of geology , U.C. San Diego . You get much of a chance to study ice down there ? Just what 's around the keg . Dr. DaSilva ? Dr. Hodge ? Agent Scully , Agent Mulder . Nice to meet you . How you doing ? Can I see some identification ? What for ? I just want to make sure we are who we say we are . It 's me . It 's you . It 's me . It 's you . - It 's me . - Thanks a lot . Appreciate it . It 's you . Well , now that we know who we are anybody care to take a guess as to why we 're going ? Two agents , a geologist , a medical doctor and a toxicologist . That should give us some idea . I assume you all took a look at the tape . Something wrong ? Come on . You 're F.B.I. You have to know more than we do . You folks the ones going up to Icy Cape ? Yeah . Then I 'm flying you . My name is Bear . The plane 's across the way . Provisions are loaded . Grab your gear . Oh , could we see some credentials ? Credentials . The only credentials I have is that I 'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there . is that I 'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there . You don 't like those credentials ... walk . Bear ... see if you can get the power started . Anything to get out of here . Where do we start ? Body bags are on the plane . Before we touch anything we have to thoroughly document the scene . Scully : Flashing . Mulder : That 's what they were drilling for . Quarter of a million years melting away in a couple of days . I want to preserve some samples . ( Rumbling ) It 's the generator . Oh . Agent Mulder ... ( Screaming ) ( Barking ) Hold on . ( Groans ) Hold it down . That will keep him out for awhile . You okay ? Yeah , he didn 't break the skin . Bear , you okay ? He got me . Get that jacket off . Give me the stuff . I 'll do it myself . DaSilva : Is it rabies ? I don 't see any indications . If it is rabies it 's certainly not a strain I 'm familiar with . Scully : Look at this . Black nodules . Swollen lymph nodes . Symptoms of bubonic plague . I 'll do a blood test . We 'll take it from there . This dog has got a skin irritation on its neck . Murphy : It looks like it 's been scratching off its own hair . Look at this . Look at this ! What the hell was that ? ( Groans ) From the autopsies it 's clear these men killed one another . There are contusions around the throat areas of three men- - evidence of strangulation . Richter and Campbell killed themselves . I also found tissue damage due to fever . Did any of them have the black spots the dog has ? No . None of them had the black nodules . So , uh , those spots didn 't have anything to do with those guys killing each other , right ? I wouldn 't rule it out . I just reexamined the dog . The nodules are gone . What could that mean ? It could mean that the spots are a symptom of some disease at an early stage . Danny ? Danny . Danny . Sorry . The play-off game against Miami , ' 82 . Helps to get my mind off stuff . My interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos is a little rusty . Murphy : All right , this is the Icy Cape area . It approximates the depth of the ice sheet to be about 3,000 meters thick . I also found this data and if I 'm reading it correctly the team actually found the ice sheet to be twice that depth . That 's very good . The numbers indicate the topography to be concave . Looks like they were drilling inside a meteor crater . Hodge : No , you 're wrong . I analyzed two samples . What did you find ? There 's a presence of ammonium hydroxide in Richter 's blood sample . It 's not possible . Ammonia would vaporize at human body temperature . I checked all the air filtration systems . I found no evidence of any such toxins . I have . In the ice , and that 's not all there is . I found a high ratio of ammonia to water in the ice core . The earth 's atmosphere could never have produced such levels even a quarter of a million years ago . Look in the scope . Unless a foreign object was introduced into that environment . Murphy : Tell me that 's not a foreign object . Scully . That same thing is in Richter 's blood . What if that single-celled organism is the larval stage of a larger animal ? That 's kind of a leap , don 't you think ? Scully : The evidence is there . Maybe the organism in the ice core somehow got into the men . Come on . Nothing can survive in sub-zero temperatures for a quarter million years . Mulder : Unless that 's how it lives . Why are you squabbling over some bug ? You said it yourself , Scully . Your autopsy found those men killed each other . That 's it . Let 's just get the hell out of here . I agree . We 'll send the bodies to a facility where they can make a definitive diagnosis . In the event that something was missed , Agent Scully . If those bodies are infected we can 't take them back . We can 't go back without proper quarantine procedures . We can 't risk bringing back the next plague . Let 's say they came down with something . We haven 't , and I ain 't waiting around until we do . I think it 's safe to go back . There 's no reason why we 'd be infected . We took the necessary safeguards . The dog did bite Bear . It jumped Mulder ! There 's only one way to proceed . A doctor eliminates every possibility . We must determine if any of us is infected . All right . Parasitic diagnostic procedure requires that each of us provide a blood and a stool sample . A stool sample ? This kind of travel always makes that tough ... for me . Mulder : Anybody got the morning sports section handy ? I ain 't dropping my cargo for no one . What I 'm doing is getting my gear , my plane and flying the hell out of here . You can 't go . The dog bit you . I got hired to fly you up here and fly you back . No one said this might be part of the deal . So the deal is over . Scully : We can 't let him leave without being checked . Scully : We can 't let him leave without being checked . Who 's going to stop him ? We have to . We can 't risk infecting the population . If he gets on that plane , I will too . There 's no time to argue . Take a vote . Who believes we should confine Bear until he agrees to an examination ? All right . Bear , we just want to check you out . If we don 't find any trace of the parasite or the virus we 'll all go . All right . Give me the damn jar . Murphy , get a rope . ( Bear Grunting ) ( Groaning ) Oh , my God ! ( Groaning ) Oh ! Get my bag . What are you gonna do ? Cutting it out . We know nothing about it . It 's killing him . Scully , help me hold the skin . Hold still , Bear . ( Screaming ) Forceps . ( Moaning ) Hodge : Hold still , Bear . Just another second . You 're going to be okay . ( Groaning ) ( Agonized Moaning ) This is the A.I.C.P. investigative team calling Doolittle Airfield . Come in . D.A.F. responding . This is Agent Mulder . We have a serious biological hazard . Request air pickup and quarantine procedures . Come in , Doolittle Airfield . We copy . This area is under a heavy storm . No aircraft can get out for the next day . Maybe the military base in Kotzebue can set up a quarantine . Advise immediate evacuation . The storm is bearing in your direction . We were told we 'd have three clear days of weather . Welcome to the top of the world , sir . Is Bear in any condition to fly ? If we don 't get out of here in an hour we don 't get out for days . He 's dead . Hodge : It 's similar to a tapeworm in that it has a scolex with suckers and hooks . You can deal with it ? What ? No . Very different from any organism- - at least that I know of . Have you figured out how it 's transmitted yet ? Exchange of fluids , touch , air , all of the above ? I don 't know . All the other dead bodies had the creature . This is the only one that 's still alive . Were they all in the spine ? No . It appears they were in the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain . Murphy : Hypothalamus . What was that again ? It 's a gland that secretes hormones although I don 't know why a parasite would want to attach to it . Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine which is what produces violent , aggressive behavior . That might be a connection . Everybody that 's been infected certainly seems to act aggressively . Maybe the worm feeds on acetylcholine which floods our capacity to control violent behavior . A parasite shouldn 't want to kill its host . It doesn 't kill you until it 's extracted . Then it releases a poison . You 're saying it 's possible the worm makes you want to kill other people which is maybe what happened to the first team . Or what could happen to us . It 's just a theory . We don 't have definite proof . Except five dead men . If the worm makes people violently aggressive then why did Richter and Campbell kill themselves ? Maybe they did it to save us . I 'm just , uh ... double-checking . Making sure I didn 't miss anything . Just some sleep , right ? Sleep . I 'm so tired , I can 't sleep . We 're all wired and hypersensitive . It will be good to get a fresh start in the morning . I don 't want to waste a second finding a way to kill this thing . I don 't know if we should kill it . This area of the ice sheet is formed over a meteor crater . The worm lives in ammonia . It survives sub-zero temperatures . Theorists in alternative life designs believe in ammonia-supported life systems on planets with freezing ... No . The meteor that crashed here may have carried that type of life to earth . Mulder , that pilot developed surface symptoms within a few minutes . Within a few hours that parasite had total control . What would happen if this got into the population ? A city the size of New York could be infected within a few days . Exactly . But what do we know about it ? This organism might be lying dormant in another crater . If we don 't kill it now , we run the risk of becoming Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads . If we kill it , we won 't know how to stop anything like it in the future . Scully : Future ! ( Indistinct Arguing ) Tell me it 's hot in here . Don 't worry . You don 't have a fever . Heating system 's malfunctioning . Outside , it 's 40 below , and in here it 's sweltering . Can you hear what they 're arguing about ? They 're probably discussing their little government secrets . You think they knew what was here before we arrived ? I 'm sure of it . Scully : ... biological hazard . You know , Bear 's infected blood did get on Scully . It also got on you . How do you know it can 't be contained ? It can ! By extermination . We should take those bodies- - worms and all- - outside and incinerate them . Something going on we should know about ? Agent Scully , you all right ? Yes , I 'm fine . It 's nothing . You seem a little stressed out . What the hell are you saying ? Let 's all settle down . It 's been a hard day . We 're all tired and scared . Let 's not turn on one another . At least not without a good reason . Mulder : We should all get some sleep . You kidding ? You think any of us could sleep right now ? Guys , let 's face it- - we got to check for spots . Any person or persons who has them should be confined . Are we agreed on that ? Are you going to do the exams ? No . We do them in front of each other . No secrets . Before anyone passes judgement , may I remind you we are in the arctic . Sleep tight . Don 't let the bedbugs bite . DaSilva : Yeah . Good night . Good night , Mulder . Good night , Scully . At least everyone 's okay . Don 't forget . The spots on the dog went away . Ball on the three-yard line . Fourth and goal with only 1 5 seconds left in the game . He moves over the ball . Here 's the snap . He goes over ... ( Gasps ) ( Door Closes ) ( Barking ) ( Dripping ) Mulder , what are you doing ? Murphy 's dead . You killed him . I found him like this . I heard one of the doors close . I came out to check it out . It was one of you . You could have done it and not known . He said he didn 't . I have no symptoms . You checked him . Six hours ago . It was one of you . Stop it ! Shut up ! Put the gun down and let Hodge give you a blood test . He 'll doctor the results . I won 't let him stick a needle in me . He has to be confined now . Turn around and let us take a look at your neck . I 'm not turning my back on anyone . As far as I 'm concerned , you 're all infected ! Hodge is right . We ought to lock him up . Mulder ... Scully , get that gun off me . You have to understand . Put it down ! You first ! Scully ! For God 's sakes , it 's me . Mulder , you may not be who you are . In here I 'll be safer than you . ( Gasping ) What were you doing ? You know what I was doing . I can 't help thinking , Agent Scully you 're the only one with a gun . If you get infected , we don 't stand a chance , do we ? Okay . Was there something there ? Hodge : You 're okay , Nancy . We 're all okay . Now is not the time for the three of us to break down and turn on each other . There 's four of us . Mulder isn 't one of us . If Mulder is infected , it 's not his fault . We can 't turn our backs on him now . He needs us to help him . She 's right . Who knows what prolonged exposure to the parasite could do ? It could damage him to the point of permanent psychosis . If he is infected , he doesn 't go back . I won 't risk the possibilities . This is A.I.C.P. calling Doolittle Airfield . Please come in . ( Static ) This is the Arctic Ice Corps Project sending a general distress call . Please respond . ( Static ) Nancy , put a drop of the uninfected blood on the slide of the blood drawn from the pilot . Run that by me again . Put the uninfected blood on the infected blood . No ! Damn it ! What did I just tell you ? You infected already infected blood . We have to start over again . I made a mistake . Don 't yell at me . Wasted hours of work . Maybe you should do it by yourself ! Damn it ! I 'm not your assistant ! Hodge . What ? Come take a look at this . The larvae from two different worms killed each other . An individual worm will not tolerate another invading its host . It does to the invader what it did to humans . It makes them kill . Hodge : But the species needs another to procreate . Worms are hermaphroditic . It can reproduce itself . Look at the evidence in the microscope . This thing does not like company . What are you saying ? The way to kill it is to introduce another worm into an already infected body ? ( Whining ) It sounds okay . It passed the worms in its stool . They 're dead . I want to talk to him first . Try and make this voluntary . What ? You can 't go in alone . If anything happens , you come inside . I can 't do this to him until I 'm sure . ( Door Opening ) It 's just you ? Yes . It 's one of them . No one 's been killed since you 've been in here . So ? We found a way to kill it . Two worms in one host will kill each other . You give me one worm , you 'll infect me . If that 's true then why didn 't you let us inspect you ? I would have , but you pulled a gun on me . Now I don 't trust them . I want to trust you . Okay . But now they 're not here . This is the last one . She 's not going to let us give it to him . Well , she 'll have to if he 's infected . He 'll convince her somehow . I just examined him . He 's uninfected . So is she . Which means that it must be one of you . All right . Let 's go over to the main building . I 'd like to check him myself . Then he can examine both of us . You want to lead the way ? No ! Get the worm . Don 't ! Oh , my God . ( Screaming ) It 's her ! No ! No ! Scully ! It 's DaSilva . ( Screaming Hysterically ) DaSilva : No ! Hodge ! Now ! Mulder . After this , there won 't be any left . They 're all going to be dead ! Do it ! ( DaSilva Screaming ) No ! Shh , shh . No ! Shh , shh . Shh , shh . ( Moaning ) It 's all right . It 's all over . It all stops right here . Right now . Okay , lock her down . She 's being put in quarantine along with the dog . We 'll keep her there until we 're sure she won 't infect the rest of the population . Our tests came back normal , so we 've been released . Plane ready . It will take you as far from the ice as you want to go . I 'm going back to the site . This time I 'm going fully prepared with proper equipment . There 's a lot of research to be done on the genetic structure on its origins ... Mulder , don 't you know ? Know what ? 45 minutes after they evacuated us they torched the place . There 's nothing left . Who did that ? The military ... the Center for Disease Control ... you ought to know . They 're your people . It 's still there , Scully . 200,000 years down . In the ice . Leave it there .

 Everybody , heads up ! Heads up ! Keep it clear , now . Okay , pushing team , move in there . I want tasers on full charge . Steady ! Go on . Step back in . And push ! We 're locked . Loading team , step away . Gatekeeper ! Jophery , raise the gate . Block the opening ! Don 't let her get out ! Somebody help him ! Work her back ! Shoot her ! Shoot her ! What 's this I hear at the airport ? Hammond 's not even here ? He sends his apologies . We are facing a $ 20 million lawsuit by the family of that worker , and you 're telling me that Hammond can 't even bother to see me ? He had to leave early . He wants to be with his daughter . She 's getting a divorce . Well , I understand that , but we 've been advised to deal with the situation now . - The insurance company ... - You okay ? The underwriters feel that the accident has raised some very serious safety questions about the park . That makes the investors very , very anxious . I had to promise to conduct a very thorough , on-site inspection . Hammond hates inspections . They slow everything down . I need to or they 'll pull the funding . That 'll slow him down even more . Watch your head . If two experts sign off on the island , the insurance guys will back off . I 've already got Ian Malcolm , but they think he 's too trendy . - They want Alan Grant . - Grant ? You 'll never get him out of Montana . Why not ? Why not ? Because Grant 's like me . He 's a digger . Dr. Grant , Dr. Sattler , we 're ready to try again . I hate computers . The feeling 's mutual . How long does this usually take ? It should bring an immediate return . You shoot the radar into the ground , and the bone bounces the image back . Bounces it back ... This new program is incredible . A few more years ' development , and we won 't even have to dig anymore . Where 's the fun in that ? It 's just a little distorted , but I don 't think it 's the computer . Post-mortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments . Velociraptor ? Yes . Good shape , too . It 's 5-6 feet high . I 'm guessing 9 feet long . - Look at the ... - What 'd you do ? He touched it . Dr. Grant 's not machine-compatible . Hell , they 've got it in for me . And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrists . It 's no wonder these guys learned how to fly . No , seriously . Well , maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present day birds than they do with reptiles . Look at the pubic bone , turned backward , just like a bird . Look at the vertebrae , full of air sacs and hollows , just like a bird . And even the word " raptor " means " bird of prey " . That doesn 't look very scary . More like a 6-foot turkey . - A turkey , huh ? - Oh , no . Okay . - Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period . - Here we go . Yoy get your first look at this 6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing . He moves like a bird , lightly bobbing his head . And you keep still , because you think that maybe his visual acuity is based on movement , like T-Rex and he 'll lose you , if you don 't move , but no , not Velociraptor . You stare at him , and he just stares right back . And that 's when the attack comes . Not from the front , but from the side . From the other two Raptors you didn 't even know were there . Because Velociraptor 's a pack hunter , you see . He uses coordinated attack patterns and he is out in force today . And he slashes at you with this , a 6-inch retractable claw , like a razor , on the middle toe . He doesn 't bother to bite your jugular like a lion , say . No , no . He slashes at you here or here . Oh , Alan ! Or maybe across the belly , spilling your intestines . The point is , you are alive when they start to eat you . So , you know , try to show a little respect . Okay . Hey , Alan , if you wanted to scare the kid , you could 've pulled a gun on him , you know . Yeah , I know . Kids . You want to have one of those ? I don 't want that kid , but a breed of the child , Dr. Grant , could be intriguing . I mean , what 's so wrong with kids ? Oh , Ellie , look , they 're noisy , they 're messy , they 're expensive . Cheap , cheap . They smell . - They do not smell ! - Some of them smell . - Give me a break ! - Babies smell . - Cover the site ! - Cover up the dig ! Tell them to shut down ! - Shut down ! - Cut the machine ! Cover it all up ! Pull it over ! Just cut it , will you ? Cut it out ! Shut it down ! What ? What the hell do you think you 're doing in here ? Hey , we were saving that ! For today , I guarantee it . Who in God 's name do you think you are ? John Hammond . And I 'm delighted to meet you finally in person , Dr. Grant . So , I can see that my 50,000 a year has been well spent . Okay , who 's the jerk ? - This is our paleobotanist , Dr ... - Sattler . Sattler . Ellie , this is Mr. Hammond . I 'm sorry about the dramatic entrance , Dr. Sattler , but ... - Did I say " jerk " ? - ... we were in a bit of a hurry . Will you have a drink ? We won 't let it get warm . Come along . Sit down , sit down . - Here , let me have this . I can do this . - I 'll just get a glass or two . No , no , no ! - I can manage this . - There 's samples all over here . I know my way around the kitchen . Now , I 'll get right to the point . I like you . Both of you . I can tell instantly about people . It 's a gift . I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica . I 've leased it from the government and I spent the last five years , setting up a kind of biological preserve . Really spectacular . Spared no expense . Make the one I 've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo . And there 's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds . And what are those ? Small versions of adults , honey . And not just kids , everyone . We 're going to open next year , that is if the lawyers don 't kill me first . I don 't care for lawyers , do you ? - I don 't really know any . - We don 't really know any . Well , I do , I 'm afraid . That 's a particular pebble in my shoe , represents my investors . Says that they insist on outside opinions . What kind of opinions ? Well , your kind , not to put too fine a point on it . I mean , let 's face it , in your particular fields , you 're the top minds . And if I could just persuade you to sign off on the park , give it your endorsement , maybe even pen a wee testimonial , I could get back on schedule . Why would they care what we think ? What kind of park is this ? It 's right up your alley . I tell what . Why don 't you come down , just the pair of you , for the weekend ? I 'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well . I 've got a jet standing by at Choteau . - Look , I 'm sorry . This isn 't just possible . - Yeah , I mean ... We just dug up a new skeleton- - I could compensate you by fully funding your dig ... - And this is a very unusual time . - The timing is for a further three years . Where 's the plane ? - Yeah , okay . - Three years ! - Cheers . - Okay . Dodgson ! You shouldn 't use my name . Dodgson . Dogson . We 've got Dodgson here ! See , nobody cares . Nice hat . What 're you trying to look like , a secret agent ? - Well ? - 750 . On delivery , 50,000 more for each viable embryo . That 's 1.5 million , if you get all 15 species off the island . I 'll get them all . Remember , viable embryos . They 're no use to us , if they don 't survive . How am I supposed to transport them ? The bottom screws open . That 's great ! Oh , my God ! It 's cooled and compartmentalized inside . You guys ! That 's great ! Customs can even check it , if they want to . - Let me see . - Go on . There 's enough coolant inside for 36 hours . No menthol ? The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then . That 's up to your guy on the boat . 7 o 'clock tomorrow night on the East Dock . Make sure he gets it right . How are you planning to beat security ? I 've got an 18-minute window . 18 minutes and your company catches up on 10 years of research . Don 't get cheap on me , Dodgson . That was Hammond 's mistake . So , you two dig up dinosaurs ? - Well ... - We try to . You 'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm . He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality , especially for a mathematician . Chaotician . Chaotician , actually . John doesn 't subscribe to chaos , particularly what it has to say about his little science project . Oh , swallow up , Ian . You 've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns- - Oh , John ! Because of the behavior of the system in phase space ? A load , if I may say so , of fashionable number crunching- - I do wish you wouldn 't do that . Dr. Sattler , Dr. Grant , you 've heard of Chaos Theory ? No . No ? Non-linear equations ? Strange attractors ? Dr. Sattler , I refuse to believe that you aren 't familiar with the concept of attraction . I bring scientists . You bring a rock star . There it is . Bad wind shears . We have to drop pretty fast . So , hold on . This can be just a little thrilling . But you need that piece over here , and that piece ... Look , we 'll have landed by the time you get it right . Great . The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place ? And the concrete moats , and the motion-sensor tracking systems . Donald , dear boy , relax . Try and enjoy yourself . Let 's get something straight , John . This is not a weekend excursion . This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . Your investors , whom I represent , are deeply concerned . 48 hours from now , if they 're not convinced , I 'm not convinced . I 'll shut you down , John . In 48 hours , I 'll be accepting your apologies . All right , slow down . Slow , slow . Stop , stop , stop , stop ! This shouldn 't be here . Alan , this species of Veriforman has been extinct since ... the Cretaceous Period . I mean , this thing ... What ? What ? Look at that ! - It 's a dinosaur . - Uh-huh . You did it . You crazy son of a bitch , you did it . We could tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness . It doesn 't apply . They 're totally wrong . This is a warm-blooded creature . This thing doesn 't live in a swamp . This thing 's got a , what , 25-27-foot neck ? The Brachiosaurus , 30 . 30 feet . We 're gonna make a fortune with this place . How fast are they ? Well , we clocked the T. rex at 32 miles an hour . - T. rex ? - Mm-hm . - You said you 've got a T. rex ? - Uh-huh . Say again . We have a T. rex . Put your head between your knees . Dr. Grant , my dear Dr. Sattler , welcome to Jurassic Park . They 're moving in herds . They do move in herds . How did you do this ? I 'll show you . Good day , good day , good day . The most advanced amusement park in the entire world , incorporating all the latest technologies . And I 'm not talking just about rides , you know . Everybody has rides . No , we 've made living biological attractions so astounding that they 'll capture the imagination of the entire planet . So , what are you thinking ? That we 're out of a job . Don 't you mean " extinct " ? Well , why don 't you all sit down ? Donald , sit down , sit down . Here he comes . Well , here I come . Hello . Say hello , say hello . - Hello . - Hello . Hello , John . Oh , yes , I 've got lines . Well , fine , fine , I guess . But , how did I get here ? Well , let me show you . First , I 'll need a drop of blood . Your blood . Right . John , that hurt ! Relax , John . It 's all part of the miracle of cloning . - Hello , John . - Hello , John . - Hello . - Hello , John . Cloned from what ? Loy extractions never recreated an intact DNA strand . Not without massive sequence gaps . Paleo-DNA , from what source ? Where do you get a hundred million-year-old dinosaur blood ? What ? What ? Oh , Mr. DNA , where did you come from ? From your blood . Just one drop of your blood contains billions of strands of DNA , the building blocks of life . A DNA strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing . And sometimes animals that went extinct millions of years ago , like dinosaurs , left their blueprints behind for us to find . We just had to know where to look . A hundred million years ago , there were mosquitoes just like today . And just like today , they fed on the blood of animals . Even dinosaurs . Sometimes , after biting a dinosaur , the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree and get stuck in the sap . After a long time , the tree sap would get hard and become fossilized , just like a dinosaur bone , preserving the mosquito inside . This fossilised tree sap , which we call amber , waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside , until Jurassic Park scientists came along . Using sophisticated techniques , they extract the preserved blood from the mosquito , and ... Bingo : Dino DNA ! A full DNA strand contains three billion genetic codes . If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day , it 'd take two years to look at the entire DNA strand . It 's that long . Since it 's so old , it 's full of holes . Now that 's where our geneticists take over . Thinking machine super-computers and gene sequencers break down the strand in minutes . And virtual-reality displays show our geneticists the gaps in the DNA sequence . We used the complete DNA of a frog to fill in the holes and complete the code . And now , we can make a baby dinosaur . This score is only temporary . It all has very dramatic music , of course . A march or something . It hasn 't been written yet . And then , of course , the tour moves on . Well , lookey here . Those hard-working cowpokes you see behind us ... This is overwhelming , John . Are these characters auto-erotica ? No , no , no . We have no animatronics here . No . Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park . ... in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs . Wait a minute . How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis ? Can 't we see the unfertilized eggs ? Shortly , shortly . Now , a whole team of genetic engineers goes to work on ... Can 't you stop these things ? I 'm sorry . It 's kind of a ride . One , two , three . - You can 't do that . - What ? Can they do that ? A reminder , the boat for the mainland will be leaving at 19 : 00 . All personnel be at the dock no later than 18 : 45 . No exceptions . Good day , Henry . Oh , good day , sir . It 's turning the eggs . Oh , perfect timing . I 'd hoped they 'd hatch before I had to go to the boat . Henry , Henry , Henry , why didn 't you tell me ? I insist on being here when they 're born . Come on . Come on . Come on , little one . Come on . Come on , little one . Come on . Come on , then . Come on , then . Very good . Push . Push . - Very good . - Oh , God ! Push . Come on . Come on . Come on , then . There you are . There you are . They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with . That 's it . Helps them to trust me . I 've been present for the birth of every little creature on this island . Surely not the ones that have bred in the wild ? Actually they can 't breed in the wild . The population control is one of our security precautions . There 's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park . How do you know they can 't breed ? Because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female . We 've engineered them that way . There you are . Oh , my God ! Look at that ! Blood temperature seems like about high 80s , maybe . Wu ? 91 . - Homoeothermic ? - Mm-hm . - It holds that temperature ? - Yes . That 's incredible . But , again , how do you know they 're all female ? What , does somebody go out in the park and pull up the dinosaurs ' skirts ? We control their chromosomes . It 's really not that difficult . All vertebrate embryos are inherently female , anyway . They just require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male . We simply deny them that . Deny them that ? John , the kind of control you 're attempting is ... It 's not possible . Listen , if there 's one thing the history of evolution has taught us , it 's that life will not be contained . Life breaks free . Expands to new territories and crashes through barriers , painfully , maybe even dangerously , but ... Well , there it is . There it is . You 're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed ? No , I 'm simply saying that life finds a way . What species is this ? It 's a Velociraptor . You bred Raptors ? Dr. Grant ! As I was saying , we laid on lunch for you before you set out into the park . - Our gourmet chef , Alejandro- - - What are they doing ? Feeding them . Alejandro 's prepared a delightful menu for us . Chilean sea bass , I believe . Shall we ? They should all be destroyed . Robert , Robert Muldoon . My game warden from Kenya . Bit of an alarmist , I 'm afraid , but knows more about Raptors than anyone . Tell me , what kind of metabolsim do they have ? What 's their growth rate ? They 're lethal at eight months , and I do mean lethal . I 've hunted most things that can hunt you , but the way these things move ... - Fast for a biped ? - Cheetah speed . 50-60 miles per hour if they ever got out in the open . And they 're astonishing jumpers . Yes , yes , yes . That 's why we 're taking extreme precautions . Do they show intelligence ? Was their brain cavity- - They show extreme intelligence . Even problem-solving intelligence . Especially the big one . We bred eight originally , but when she came in , she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others . That one ... when she looks at you , you can see she 's working things out . That 's why we have to feed them like this . She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . The fences are electrified , though , right ? That 's right , but they never attack the same place twice . They were testing the fences for weaknesses , systematically . They remember . Yes . Well , who 's hungry ? More adventurous guests , of course , can opt for our jungle river cruise or for a close-up look at our majestic ... None of these attractions are ready yet , of course , but the park will open with the basic tour you are about to take . And then other rides will come online 6 or 12 months after that . Absolutely spectacular designs ! Spared no expense . Ian , we can charge anything we want . 2,000 a day , 10,000 a day . And people will pay it . And then there 's the merchandise . - I can personally- - - Donald , Donald . This park was not built to cater only for the super-rich . Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals . Sure . They will . We 'll have a coupon day or something . See , the lack of humility before nature that 's being displayed here staggers me . Thank you , Dr. Malcom , but I think things are a little bit different than you and I had feared . Yeah , I know . They 're a lot worse . Now , wait a second . We haven 't even seen the park yet ... Donald , let him talk . There 's no reason . I want to hear every viewpoint . I really do . Don 't you see the danger , John , inherent in what you 're doing here ? Genetic power 's the most awesome force the planet 's ever seen , but you wield it like a kid that 's found his dad 's gun . It 's hardly appropriate to start hurling- - If I may . I 'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you 're using here . It didn 't require any discipline to attain it . You know , you read what others had done , and you took the next step . You didn 't earn the knowledge for yourselves , so you don 't take any responsibility for it . You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could . And before you even knew what you had , you patented it , and packaged it , and slapped it on a plastic lunch box , and now you 're selling it . You 're going to sell it . Well ... I don 't think you 're giving us our due credit . Our scientists have done things , which nobody has ever done before . Yeah , yeah , but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could , they didn 't stop to think if they should . Condors . Condors are on the verge of extinction . - If I was to ... No , no . - No , no , no . If I was to create a flock of condors on this island , you wouldn 't have anything to say . No , hold on . This isn 't some species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam . Dinosaurs had their shot , and nature selected them for extinction . I simply don 't understand this Luddite attitude . Especially from a scientist . I mean , how can we stand in the light of discovery and not act ? What 's so great about discovery ? It 's a violent , penetrative act that scars what it explores . What you call discovery , I call the rape of the natural world . Well , the question is , how can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem ? And therefore , how could you ever assume that you can control it ? You have plants in this building that are poisonous . You picked them , because they look good . But these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they 're in , and they 'll defend themselves . Violently , if necessary . Dr. Grant , if there 's one person here who could appreciate what I am trying to do ... The world has just changed so radically , and we 're all running to catch up . I don 't want to jump to any conclusions , but look ... Dinosaurs and man , two species separated by 65 million years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together . How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect ? I don 't believe it . You 're meant to come down here and defend me against these characters , and the only one I 've got on my side is the blood-sucking lawyer . Thank you . They 're here . You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park . Spend a little time with our target audience . - Grandpa ! - Kids ! Wait ! - Careful with me . - We missed you . Me , too , Grandpa . - We loved the presents . They were great . - It was good to see you . Did you enjoy the helicopter ? Yeah , it went down , and we all went right up . Now , kids , come away . Not too close to the cars . Aren 't they lovely ? Aren 't they glorious , though ? These will be your transports for the afternoon . - No drivers ? - No , no , no . No drivers . They 're electric . They run on this track in the middle of the roadway here . Totally non-polluting . Top of the line . Spared no expense . It 's an interactive CD-ROM ! Must be ! You just touch the right part of the screen , and it talks about whatever you want . Lex , darling , you 're all right in there . Dr. Sattler , come with me . Dr. Grant , come in the second car . I 'm going to ride with Dr. Sattler . I read your book . That 's ... That 's great . Do you really think that dinosaurs turned into birds and that 's where they all went ? A few species may have evolved along those lines . 'Cause they sure don 't look like birds to me . I heard that there was this meteor , hit the earth someplace down in Mexico , and made this big crater . Listen ... Tim . Tim , which car were you planning on ? Whichever one you are . Then I heard about this thing in Omni about this meteor making all this heat . And it made a bunch of diamond dust and that changed the weather . And they died because of the weather . And then my teacher tells me about this other book by a guy named Bakker . And he says ... She said I should ride with you , because it 'd be good for you . The boat is now loading . Everyone must be on the dock for the 19 : 00 departure . National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm about 75 miles west of us . Why didn 't I build in Orlando ? I 'll keep an eye on it . Maybe it 'll swing south like the last one . Ray ... Start the tour program . Hold on to your butts . You want to join the future , right ? So , God help us when the hands of engineers ... During most of your tour , the appropriate information will be auto - matically selected and displayed for you . Hey , look ! Simply touch the area of the screen displaying the appropriate icon . Are we gonna hit that ? Welcome to Jurassic Park . What have they got in there , King Kong ? The voice you 're now hearing is Richard Kiley . We spared no expense . If you look to the right , you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs on our tour , called Dilophosaurus . Dilophosaurus ! Shit ! One of the earliest carnivores , we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous , spitting its venom at its prey , causing blindness and eventually paralysis , allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure . This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful but deadly addition to Jurassic Park . Alan ? Where ? Damn ! Vehicle headlights are on and they 're not responding . Those shouldn 't be running off of car batteries . Item 151 on today 's glitch list . We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo , and the computers aren 't even on their feet yet . Dennis , our lives are in your hands , and you have butterfingers ? I am totally unappreciated in my time . You can run this whole park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days . You think that kind of automation is easy ? Or cheap ? You know anybody who can network 8 connection machines and debug 2 million lines of code for what I bid for this job ? 'Cause if you can , I 'd love to see them try . I 'm sorry about your financial problems , Dennis . I really am . But they are your problems . Oh , you 're right , John . You 're absolutely right . You know , everything 's my problem . I will not get drawn into another financial debate with you , Dennis . I really will not . There 's been hardly any debate at all . I don 't blame people for their mistakes . But I do ask that they pay for them . - Thanks , Dad . - Dennis ! The headlights . Yeah , I 'll debug the tour program when they get back , okay ? Okay ? It 'll eat a lot of compute cycles . We 'll lose part of the system for a while . There 's a finite amount of memory , you can 't use it for everything . You 're going to compile for a half an hour ... Quiet , all of you ! They 're approaching the Tyrannosaur paddock . God creates dinosaurs . God destroys dinosaurs . God creates man . Man destroys God . Man creates dinosaurs . Dinosaurs eat man . Woman inherits the earth . We 'll try to tempt the Rex now . Keep watching the fence . What 's going to happen to the goat ? He 's going to eat the goat ? Excellent . What 's the matter , kid ? You never had lamb chops ? I happen to be a vegetarian . T. rex doesn 't want to be fed . He wants to hunt . You can 't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct . Now , eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour , right ? Hello . Hello . Yes ? I really hate that man . The Tyrannosaur doesn 't obey any set patterns or park schedules . The essence of chaos . I 'm still not clear on chaos . It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems . The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect . A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking , and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine . - Was I going too fast ? - I missed it . I go too fast . I did a fly-by . Give me that glass of water . We 're going to conduct an experiment . It should be still . The car 's bouncing up and down . But that 's okay . It 's just an example . Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic . Now , let 's say a drop of water falls on your hand . Which way is the drop going to roll off ? Which finger or thumb ? Thumb , I 'd say . - Uh-huh . Okay . - Right . Now , freeze your hand , freeze your hand . Don 't move . I 'm going to do the same thing , start with the same place again . - Which way is going to roll off , now ? - Right . - Let 's say back the same way . - The same way . It changed . Why ? Because tiny variations , the orientation of the hairs on your hands ... Hey , Alan , look at this . ... the amount of blood distending your vessels , imperfections in the skin ... Imperfections in the skin ? Just microscopic . ... never repeat and vastly affect the outcome . That 's what ? Unpredictability . There . Look at this . See ? See ? I 'm right again . Nobody could have predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle . Alan ! And there 's another example . See , here I am now by myself , talking to myself . That 's Chaos Theory . Stop the program . I told you , how many times , we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors . Stopping park vehicles and rebooting program . We 're on . Will notify for resume . Like I was saying , there 's this other book by a guy named Bakker , and he says dinosaurs died from a bunch of diseases . Alan , where are we going ? - He definitely didn 't say they turned into birds . - You see something ? Is there anybody else who thinks that we shouldn 't be out here ? And his book was a lot fatter than yours . - It was like this . - Really ? Yours was fully illustrated , honey . You okay ? Hey , look at this . Wait . Hey , watch . Hey , come on . Watch this . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Everybody stay here . - Timmy ! - Hey , Timmy ! Oh , wow ! - Okay ? - Of course . Don 't be scared . Come on , it 's okay . Muldoon tranquillized her for me . She 's sick . Oh , my God ! Hey , baby girl . Triceratops was always my favorite when I was a kid , and now I see she 's the most beautiful thing I ever saw . It 's okay . Microvesicles . That 's interesting . Thanks . What are her symptoms ? - Imbalance , disorientation , labored breathing . - Right . It seems to happen about every six weeks or so . Six weeks . These are dilated . - They are ? - Take a look . - It 's okay . - I 'll be damned . That 's pharmacological . From local plant life . Is this West Indian lilac ? Yes . We know they 're toxic , but the animals don 't eat them . Are you sure ? Pretty sure . There 's only one way to be positive . I 'd have to see the dinosaur 's droppings . Dino droppings ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I got that . That storm center hasn 't dissipated or changed course . We 're gonna have to cut the tour short , I 'm afraid . We 'll pick it up again tomorrow wherever left off . Are you sure we have to ? It 's not worth taking the chance , John . Sustained winds at 45 knots . Tell them when they get back in the cars . Ladies and gentlemen , last shuttle leaving for the dock leaves in approximately five minutes . Drop what you 're doing and leave now . Damn ! That is one big pile of shit . You 're right . There 's no trace of lilac berries . That 's so odd , though . All right , so , she 's suffering from Melia toxicity every six weeks . Let 's see , rats . She 's ... tenacious . You have no idea . You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything ? Doctors , if you please , I have to insist that we get moving . You know , if it 's all right , I 'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the Trike . - If , you know ... - Sure . I 'm in a gas-powered jeep . I can drop her off at the visitor center before I make the boat with the others . Great . Then I 'll catch up with you , if you want to go on . You sure ? Yeah , I want to stay with her a little longer . - Okay , then . - Okay . There 's nothing I can do . The captain says we got to go , we got to go . No , no , no , listen , you 've got to give me the time . I did a test run on this thing , it took me 20 minutes . I thought I could maybe push it to 18 , but you 've got to give me at least 15 minutes . Give me the 15 minutes . No promises . Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage . So much for our first tour . Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops . It could 've been worse , John . A lot worse . Anybody want a soda or something ? 'Cause I 'm going up to the machine . I thought maybe , you know , I 'd get somebody something , 'cause I 've had only sweets and I think I 'm gonna get something salty . Oh , I finished debugging the phones . You know , I was going to , so I did . You told me , so I debugged the phones . And I thought maybe ... I should tell you that the system is gonna be compiling for 18 to 20 minutes , so some of the minor systems , they might go on and off for a while . But it 's nothing to worry about . It 's a simple thing . Do you got any kids ? Me ? Oh , hell , yeah . Three . I love kids . Anything at all can and does happen . The same with wives , for that matter . You 're married ? Occasionally . Yeah , I 'm always on the look-out for a future ex-Mrs . Malcolm . Five , four , three , two , one . - That 's odd . - What ? Door security systems are shutting down . Well , Nedry said a few systems would go off-line , didn 't he ? By the way , Dr. Sattler , she 's not , like , available , is she ? Why ? Yeah , I 'm sorry . You two are ... Yeah . Hey , what 'd I touch ? You didn 't touch anything . We stopped . What the hell ? What now ? Fences are failing all over the park . Find Nedry . Check the vending machines . Look at this work station ! What a complete slob ! The Raptor fences aren 't out , are they ? No , no . They 're still on . Why the hell would he turn the other ones off ? Access main program . Access main security . Access main program grid . You didn 't say the magic word . Please ! God damn it ! I hate this hacker crap ! Phone Nedry 's people in Cambridge . Phones are out , too . Where did the vehicles stop ? Their radio 's out , too . - Gennaro said to stay put . - Kids okay ? I didn 't ask . Why wouldn 't they be ? - Kids get scared . - What 's to be scared of ? - It 's just a little hiccup in the power . - I didn 't say I was scared . - I didn 't say you were scared . - I know . Hey , where did you find this ? In the box , under my seat . - Are they heavy ? - Yeah . Then they 're expensive . Put them back . Don 't scare me . Cool ! Night vision . Did you feel that ? Maybe it 's the power trying to come back on . What is that ? Where 's the goat ? Oh , Jesus ! He left us ! Where does he think he 's going ? When you got to go , you got to go . Dr. Grant ! Boy , do I hate being right all the time . Keep absolutely still . Its vision is based on movement . Turn the light off . Turn the light off ! Hurry ! Turn it off ! I 'm sorry ! You 're the one who turned it ... Hey ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Ian , freeze ! Get the kids ! Get rid of the flare ! Get the kids ! Get rid of the flare ! Hail Mary , full of grace . The Lord is with thee . No , no ! - Dr. Grant ! - Okay , Lex , I got you . I 'm stuck . The seat 's got my feet . I 'll get you next . You 're okay . Come on . Good . All right . Tim ! Don 't move . He can 't see us , if we don 't move . Lex , you 're choking me . Grab the wire . " Keycheck space minus 0 . Keychecks off , safety space minus 0 . " He 's turning the safety systems off . He doesn 't want anybody to see what he 's about to do . Now , look at this next entry . It 's the kicker . " White rabbit object . " Whatever , it did , it did it all . With the keychecks off , the computer didn 't file the keystrokes . So , the only way to find them now is to go through the computer 's lines of code one by one . How many lines of code are there ? About two million . - Two million ? - Yeah . Robert , I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren . Sure . I 'm going with him . John . John . I can 't get Jurassic Park back online without Dennis Nedry . Should 've been there by now . Damn ! There 's the road ! Winch this sucker off the thing and then tie it to that thing there . And then pull down this thing here , and pull it back up again . My glasses ! I can afford more glasses . You 've got time . You 've got time . You can do it . Do it . Come on , Dennis . Hello . Yeah , that 's nice . I 've got to go . Nice boy . Nice boy . Nice dinosaur . Thought you were one of your big brothers . You 're not so bad . You 're not so bad . What do you want ? What do you want ? You want food ? Look at me . I just fell down a hill . I 'm soaking wet . I don 't have any food . I have no food on me . I have nothing on me . Go on . Play fetch ? Look , stick . See , stick . See , stick . Yeah . Yeah , look . Look , stick . Look stick . Stick , stupid . Fetch the stick , boy . Look at the stick . Yes . You like the stick ? Go on and get it . No wonder you 're extinct . I 'm gonna run you over when I come back down . Timmy ! Get out ! Now , Lex , listen , listen . Lex , I 'm right here . I 'm gonna look after you , but I have to go help your brother . So , I want you to stay right here and wait for me . He left us ! But that 's not what I 'm gonna do . Okay ? Stay here . Timmy ! Tim ! You hear me ? I 'm coming up . I hate climbing . I hate trees . Way too high . Tim ? Tim ? Tim . You okay ? I threw up . That 's okay . Just give me your hand . Tim , I won 't tell anyone you threw up . Just give me your hand . Here , I 've got you . Okay . That 's good . Over the rail . - Don 't pull me too hard . - Don 't worry . Stand on the door . Hang on to me . - Okay , that 's not too bad , right , Timmy ? - Yes , it is . It 's just like coming off a tree house . Did your dad ever build you a tree house , Tim ? - No . - Yeah , me , too . The thing about climbing is , you never , never look down . - Never . - This is impossible . - That 's all . - How am I gonna to do this ? - I 'm gonna help you with your footing . - It 's about 50 feet . Oh , no . Tim , go ! Go , go , go , go , Tim , go ! Faster , Tim ! Tim , jump ! Go , Tim . Well ... We 're back in the car again . At least you 're out of the tree . Where 's the other car ? Alan ! Dr. Grant ! Alan ! Grant ! I think this was Gennaro . I think this was , too . I think it 's ahead of us . It could be anywhere . With fences down , it can wander in and out of any paddock it likes . He 's put a tourniquet on . Ian ! Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend . Can we chance moving him ? Please chance it . Ellie , come on ! Wait , wait . It 's the other car ! Dr. Grant ? Alan ! They 're not here . Anybody hear that ? It 's a ... It 's an impact tremor , is what it is . I 'm fairly alarmed here . Come on , come on , come on . We 've got to get out of here . We 've got to get out of here . Now ! Now ! Right now ! Go , go , go ! Let 's go ! Hey ! Start the engine ! Must go faster . Here it comes ! Step on it ! Fifth gear ! Get off the stick ! Bloody move ! Look out ! Down ! Think they 'll have that on the tour ? Are you hearing this ? Come on , Tim . Come on , hurry up . Let 's get up this tree . Come on , Tim , it 's okay . Listen , try up here . Oh , man ! I hate trees . They don 't bother me . Oh , yeah ? Well , you weren 't in the last one . Hey ! Look at the Brontosauruses . I mean , Brachiosauruses . They 're singing ! Don 't let the monsters come over here . They 're not monsters , Lex , they 're just animals and these are herbivores . That means they only eat vegetables . - But for you , I think they 'd make an exception . - Tim ! Well , I hate the other kind . They just do what they do . What is that ? What are you and Ellie gonna do now , if you don 't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore ? I don 't know . I guess ... I guess we 'll just have to evolve , too . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? I don 't know . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? " Do-you-think-he-saurus " . What do you call a blind dinosaur 's dog ? You got me . A " Do-you-think-he-saurus rex " . - Alan ? - Yeah ? What if the dinosaurs come back , while we 're all asleep ? - I 'll stay awake . - All night ? All night . They were all melting . Malcolm 's okay for now . I gave him a shot of morphine . They 'll be fine . Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert . You know , the first ... attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland ... was a flea circus , Petticoat Lane . Really quite wonderful . I had a wee trapeze and a ... merry-go ... carousel . And a seesaw . They all move , motorized , of course , but ... People would say they could see the fleas . " Oh , I can see the fleas , mommy . Can 't you see the fleas ? " Clown fleas , and high-wire fleas , and fleas on parade . With this place , I wanted to show them something that wasn 't an illusion . Something that was real . Something that they could ... see and touch . An aim not devoid of merit . But you can 't think through this one , John . You have to feel it . You 're right . You 're absolutely right . Hiring Nedry was a mistake , that 's obvious . We 're over-dependent on automation . I can see that now . Now , the next time , everything 's correctable . John ! Creation is an act of sheer will . Next time , it 'll be flawless . It 's still the flea circus . It 's all an illusion . When we have control again ... You 've never had control ! That 's the illusion ! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place . But I made a mistake , too . I didn 't have enough respect for that power , and it 's out now . The only thing that matters now are the people we love . Alan and Lex and Tim . John , they 're out there , where people are dying . It 's good . Spared no expense . Go away ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's a Brachiosaurus . It 's a " Veggie-saurus , " Lex . " Veggie-saurus " . Veggie . Come on . Come on , girl . Come on . Come on . Come on , baby . Go ! I 'm not letting go ! - It looks like it has a cold . - Yeah . Maybe . - Can I touch it ? - Sure . Just think of it as kind of a big cow . I like cows . Hey , come on , girl . Come on up here , girl . Come on . Up here . God bless you . - Yuck . - Oh , great ! Now she 'll never try anything new . She 'll just sit in her room , and never come out , and play on her computer . I 'm a hacker . That 's what I said . You 're a nerd . I am not a computer nerd . I prefer to be called a hacker . Oh , God ! You know what this is ? It 's a dinosaur egg . The dinosaurs are breeding . But my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls . - Amphibian DNA . - What 's that ? Well , on the tour , the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene-sequence gaps . They mutated the dinosaur genetic code and blended it with that of frogs . Now ... Some West African frogs have been known to spontaniously change sex from male to female in a single sex environment . Malcolm was right . Look . Life found a way . No , no , no . That 's crazy . You 're out of your mind . He 's absolutely out of his mind . Well , wait a minute . What exactly would this mean ? We 're talking about a calculated risk , my dear , which is about the only option left to us . We will never find the command that Nedry used . He 's covered his tracks far too well . I think it 's obvious now that he 's not coming back . So , shutting down the entire system- - You can get somebody else , because I won 't do it . - Shutting down the system ... - I will not ! is the only way to wipe out everything that he did . Now , as I understand it , all the systems will then come back on their original start-up mode . Correct ? Theoretically , yes . But we 've never shut down the entire system before . It may not come back on at all . Would we get the phones back ? Yes , again , in theory . What about the lysine contingency ? We could put that into effect . What 's that ? That is absolutely out of the question . The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals , in case they ever get off the island . Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism . The animals can 't manufacture the amino acid , lysine . Unless they 're completely supplied with lysine by us , they slip into a coma and die . People are dying ! Will you please shut down the system ? Hold on to your butts . It 's okay . Look , see that ? It 's on . It worked . What do you mean it worked ? Everything 's still off . Maybe the shutdown tripped the circuit breakers . All we have to do is turn them back on , reboot a few systems in here , telephones , security doors , half dozen others , but it worked . - System 's ready . - Where are the breakers ? Maintenance shed at the end of the compound . Three minutes , I can have power back on in the entire park . Just to be safe , I want everybody in the emergency bunker , until Mr. Arnold returns , and the whole system 's up and running again . - I 'm tired . - I 'm dirty . - I 'm hot . - Just keep going guys . Looking at the map , I 'd say the visitor 's center 's just about a mile over that rise there . We just keep ... What is that ? Tim ... Tim , can you tell me what they are ? Gallimimus . Are those meat-eating ? " Meat-asauruses " ? Look at the wheeling . Uniform direction changes . Just like a flock of birds evading a predator . They 're ... flocking this way . I want to go now . Just look how it eats . Please . I bet you 'll never look at birds the same way again . - Yes . - Go now . Okay . Keep low and follow me . Look how much blood . Oh , God ! Something went wrong . Something 's happened . Something 's wrong . This is just a delay . That 's all it is . All major theme parks have delays . When they opened Disneyland in 1956 , nothing worked . Nothing ! But John , if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down , the pirates don 't eat tourists . I can 't wait any more . Something went wrong . I 'm gonna go get the power back on . You can 't just stroll down the road , you know ? Well , don 't let be too hasty . I mean , it 's only been gone ... - I 'm going with you . - Okay . Sorry . Now , this isn 't going to be just like switching on the kitchen light . But I think I can follow this and then talk you through it . Right . But it ought to be me , really , going . Why ? Well , I 'm a ... And you 're a ... - Look ... - Come on , let 's go . We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back . You just take me through this step by step . I 'm on Channel 2 . Right . The shutdown must 've turned off all the fences . Damn it , even Nedry knew better than to mess with the Raptor pen . Come on , this way . I can see the shed from here . We can make it if we run . No . We can 't . Why not ? Because we 're being hunted . In the bushes , straight ahead . It 's all right . Like hell it is . Run . Towards the shed . I 've got her . Go . Now ! Mr. Arnold ? Mr. Arnold ? John , I 'm in . Great . Ahead of you is a metal staircase . Go down it . Okay . Going down . After 20 or 30 feet you come to a T-junction . Take a left . Just have her follow the main cable , John . I understand how to read a schematic . I guess that means the power 's off . That 's not funny . That was great . Well , maybe we , we could ... Damn it . Dead end . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Yes , there should 've been a right turn back there somewhere . Look above you . There should be a large bundle of cable and pipes all heading in the same direction . Follow that . Okay . Following the piping . Timmy , I bet I could climb over the top and get to the other side before you could even get to the top . What would you give me ? Respect . Come on , guys , it 's not a race . I see the box . It says , " High Voltage " . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Good . Here we go . Over the top . Take your time , Tim . That 's good . Come on . Find your footing . Ellie , you can 't throw the main switch by hand . You 've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge . It 's large , flat , and gray . All right , here I go . Okay ? One , two , three , four . Okay , charged . Under the words " Contact Position " there 's a round green button , which says " Push to Close " . " Push to Close " . Okay . Push it . Now , Ellie , the red buttons turn on the individual park systems . Switch them on . - Timmy ! - Get down now ! Tim , you 're gonna have to jump . You crazy ? I 'm not gonna jump ! - Tim , do what Dr. Grant says ! - Let go ! - I 'll count to three . - Quick , quick ! One , two , three ! I 'm coming up . I 'm coming up to get you . - Lex , I 've got to get Tim . - Okay . I 'm gonna count to three . One ... Two ... Timmy , Timmy ! He 's not breathing . Mr. Hammond , I think we 're back in business ! No ! Oh , Mr. Arnold ! Clever girl . Tim ! No , Tim ! Good boy . Three . Hello ? Okay . I 'm gonna have to find the others . Get you to a doctor . Lex , you look after Tim . - Yeah . - Hey ! Your hair is all sticking up . Big Tim , the human piece of toast . I 'll be back soon . I promise . Ellie ! Run . Ellie ! It 's just the two Raptors , right ? You sure the third one 's contained ? Yes . Unless they figure out how to open doors . Timmy , what is it ? It 's a Velociraptor . It 's inside . Follow me . It 's in there . Control room . We can call for help ? We 've got to reboot the system first . The door locks ! Ellie , boot up the door locks ! No , boot up the door locks ! Ellie , get back ! Boot up the door locks ! You can 't hold it by yourself ! It 's a UNIX system . I know this . It 's all the files of the whole park . It tells you everything . I 've got to find the right file . Try to reach the gun . I can 't get it unless I move . Come on , Lex ! This is it . This might be the right file . This isn 't the right file . Come on , Lex ! - You got it ! - Yes ! This is it ! - Yes ! Yes ! - Yes ! This is it ! What works ? All security systems are enabled . We got it ! Grant . Mr. Hammond , the phones are working . The children all right ? The children are fine . Call the mainland . Tell them to send the damn helicopters . It 's gonna cut through the glass ! Grant ? Grant ! Move ! Quick ! Tim , move ! Tim , let go . Yeah . - Hold on to me . Hold on ! - Hammond ... After careful consideration , I 've decided not to endorse your park . So have I. Come on . Come on .

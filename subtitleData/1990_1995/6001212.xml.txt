Humble maybe from the outside . Yes , well , appearances can be deceiving . Now how can I help you ? It 's Superboy . Something 's happened , and he 's turned into this--this- - Becoming like that madman . Yeah . I was afraid something like that might happen . Then you 'll be able to help him ? If I can get to him before nightfall . Otherwise it 'll be too late . What are all those powders for ? Some of these powders can cure Superboy , and others can kill him . Wa--wait . I thought you said you were gonna save him . Wh--what are--what are you doing ? Mixing magic . Magicians never tell their Trust me . If you don 't mind , I 'd like for you to wait outside . Sure . Thank you . The fact that he succumbed to the madman 's attack proves that he 's vulnerable to magic . So I 've got to fight fire with fire in order to bring Superboy back . Then all that stuff in your trailer , you use it all to fight evil magic ? I try . I 've dedicated my life to it . Why ? Wait , I 'm picking something up . You 've got a radar .

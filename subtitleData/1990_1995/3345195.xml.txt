 It 's moving . Right on schedule . How many more androids are left ? Hey , it 's looking for the next target . Target Search : Confirmed Android D Destroyed Target : Android E Something 's wrong with the High Speed Maneuvering System . Don 't worry about it . Android C Locked On Fabulous ! This robot 's features are incredible there is no need to install that unit . No , currently solo activity is imperfect . I need approval from the Council to have an investigator simulate a combat with it . Is there an investigator who can do it ? There 's an investigator working on a nearby planet . Registration Number 9799-5 Investigator : Iria Currently on a mission to secure Kamanite stolen by Kamatch Family . Zeiram Unit Attachment : Complete First Mission : Assist Investigator Iria That 's wrong . That 's the play button . I know . If you keep bugging me , I won 't buy it . You 're not gonna use it without reading the manual again and bring it back in a few days , claiming it 's broken or defective , are you ? Don 't be silly . You learn these things by experimenting . That 's odd , it turned off . Oh , excuse me , I 'm looking for this street . Do you know how to get there ? What 's her problem ? Anyway , could you make up your mind ? Well , they all look the same to me ... I guess that one . This one , right ? Hey , Kamiya . Hello ? Oh , it 's you , Teppei . Can you make it 30 minutes earlier tomorrow ? The schedule changed a bit . Tomorrow ? Sorry , I can 't make it tomorrow . What ? You told me you 'd be happy to come to my wedding ! I will show up for the second party . Can I do that instead ? Kamiya ! Kamiya , are you listening to me ? Very , very nice legs ... Kamiya ! Oh yeah , Teppei ... Do you know Akemi 's shoe size ? What are you talking about ? Last time we were all together , we were talking about feet . Do you remember what she said ? I don 't know ! Everyone 's here . Shall we go ? Now , please show him the Kamarite . All right , show me the money . What is the meaning of this ? Listen ... If you use this here , you will be ' saved ' forever . Iria ... Kill her ! Awesome . Bob , can you hear me ? I 've secured the Kamarite , you can retrieve us now . Okay , I understand . Are you sure I can borrow this for tomorrow ? What is Mister Kamiya thinking , skipping your wedding like this ? You do agree with me . I know he is a colleague at work and I 've known him for a long time but this time he really pissed me off ! Now now , don 't be so mad ... Oh ... That 's not good , Mister Teppei . What did you do ? It 's a sign of misfortune , something bad may happen to you . I , Taguchi will purify you right away . Wait a moment , I 'll get ready . Now , I 'm supposed to say " I 'm home " ! Fujikuro , you 're getting better with the local dialect . Yeah , I like it . Welcome back , Iria . We have been using this world as our base for three years . I wonder how those two are ? Those two ? Who are they ? Partners who are more reliable than you are . Partners ? As soon as we finish , why don 't we see them again ? Well ... Hey , let me see it . Bob , I 'm inputting the restoration codes . Okay ... I didn 't realize these things were once used as transpoters . Yes , this is one of the ancient transportation devices . It 's one of the seven remaining . Well , is it real ? Yes , it is real . And it 's in good condition , you could probably even use it . Don 't be wasteful ! If you sell it on the black market , you won 't have to work for the rest of your life . Do you want to become a fugitive too ? Iria , there is one thing to report . What is it ? It 's about the backup personnel ... Apparently , a problem occurred during transportation . It looks like the arrival time and location were scrambled ... What do you mean , Bob ? Are you saying I should go get it ? There 's no other way , it 's a robot . It 's been damaged , I can 't reprogram it remotely . Unlike us , it isn 't adaptable . The case is closed , why not just leave it ? We cannot , because Iria and I accepted it as a job . A job ? After finishing the support job on this planet we will relocate it to Tyrant , and simulate combat using Type B equipment ... Bob ! That doesn 't concern Fujikuro . S-Sorry . Oh , don 't be a stranger . When you were stranded with a broken transporter at Tao Wa Jan , who saved you ? How long ago was that ? I 've already paid back my debts . Even your payment for this job is special . Oh , come on . Fujikuro , we 're finished working with you . Yeah , yeah , I understand . Iria ... Before you go , could you check the parabolic antenna ? Okay . Yeah , Kamiya can 't make it . Right . Well there 's another person I wanted to invite but she lives far away , so ... Yeah , I 'll call you later , then . Yeah , right ... Right . Iria ? It will only take me half an hour . Oh , excuse me , I need to get a pack of cigarettes . Misfortune awaits you in that direction . I 'm telling you , you shouldn 't go . Iria , are you all set ? I 'm ready . Transport me now . Okay , I understand . Hey , where is this place Iria went to ? Is it far from here ? It 's about 40 minutes by a common vehicle of this planet . I see . What are you doing ? Stop it ! Iria won 't be able to return ! I tried to warn her that misfortune awaits in that direction ! This was your objective from the beginning . Don 't take it personally . Once you restored it , it became mine for the taking . What ? What ? It seems misfortune effects everyone . Shut up ! It seems misfortune affects everyone . It seems misfortune effects everyone . Transport me to where Iria went at once ... Iria ? Are you a friend of Iria ? What ? I said ... Teppei ! Bob ! You shut up ! So , do you have a vehicle called a " Four Wheeled Motor Car " ? Old man , I 'm going to borrow the TV . Don 't do that , it 's just getting good . Oh , stop complaining . You better put it back later . Hey , clean up will ya ! Yeah . That was terrible , Kamiya ... 3-4 was a total disaster . I quit playing the horses . Welcome . You should too . Go get married and settle down . What do you mean by that ? By the way , Kamiya , did you meet with the boss today ? No ... Thought so , he was angry . Let me see ... He mentioned the business with Yamamoto Shoji . He said he won 't give you a bonus this year . Shit , I forgot all about it ! Shit ! What 's that ? That 's a phone . Hello ? Oh , Teppei ? It 's Kamiya . Thank you for your business . What 's he talking about ? I 'm calling to ask you about Yamamoto Shoji . Do you know what happened with it ? About that client ... Listen , the president said go to the Makeyama building for that . Kameyama building ? But that 's a deserted building , isn 't it ? What are you talking about ? Teppei . Listen to me . Yes ? That woman 's here again . Are you listening ? Yes . The boss said go to the Kameyama building in regard to that case also . I have to go now . What is he saying ? Finally , he comes . Excuse me ... It 's Takahashi Electronics . Excuse me . Ka ... Kamiya ... Hey , is it ... We 've arrived . I guess I need to walk from here on . Good riddance . Get out ! Hey ! I didn 't realize you could find this place . I wish I could compliment you , but I 'm busy . Sorry , but I can 't bother with you now . I can 't do that . You embarrassed us last time . No matter how many times you try the results will be the same because you have no chance of winning . Unfortunately , this time it 's not just the three of us . Iria ! Being here with this many people can be considered an A class crime . Do you know that ? If you return the Kamarite , we will just settle with one of your arms ! Really ? Can you really take this away from me ? Damn , she really had it . What now ? Showtime 's over , come on . But , wait ... Good . Teppei better be all right . Iria is far more competent than the man who took Teppei . Ouch ! Shit ! When I fix you , I 'm charging you repair fees this time . There she is ! Bob , can you hear ? Bring me back now , things are going bad . Bob ! Attack ! There ... Wait a second . I can 't drive like this . Later . You brought reinforcements . Stop ! There , it 's connected . How do you feel ? Okay , I can contact Iria now . Hey , what is that ? What is going on ? Iria , what happened ? Send me the visual . Who are they ? Looks like they tried to attack Iria . I would guess they were all killed by her back up . That 's ... Iria , what are you doing ? He was trying to help you . You call this help ? This is mass murder . But he did protect you . If he hadn 't come ... Bob ! You saw the visual . These weren 't faceless attackers ... We knew some of them . I do agree that he went too far ... I 've had enough . Decline the match and transport him back . I can 't , Fujikuro destroyed the transporter . Hey , what happened to Teppei ? Is he there ? Kamiya ! Why are you there ? Hey listen , I didn 't come here expecting to see you . Teppei went there , right ? Teppei 's here ? What do you mean ? This is one messed up guy . Is Teppei with you ? So , your partner 's name is Teppei . Be careful , if anything happens to him , I will kill you . Stop saying such scary things . Let 's trade , come with me . How far are we going ? We 're almost there . But first , get rid of all your weapons . Up ahead , there 's a flashy car parked by the road . And ? He 's in there . Is he all right ? Yeah , for now ... However if I press this , then boom ! So , give me the Kamarite . Now , take me to where Teppei is . Teppei ? Hey , your partner 's good . I said that he was better than you . We 're going to look for Teppei . Trouble ! What is it ? We have incoming orders to destroy the robot . Why ? lsn 't it supposed to be an ally ? According to analysis , the probability of it losing control is 98 % . The cause is a biological unit that was installed . Can you be more clear ? It 's Zeiram ! What ? There is no way to control it . Combat Mode : Creating Battle Zone 3-D Scan : Executing Spacing Data Under Construction : Carving Elemental Materials Level-5 Zone Force Field Construction Completed What ? What the hell just happened ? Bob , what 's going on ? It 's him , it 's starting . What do you mean ? I mean , it 's out of control ! I 'm receiving a message from him . It says , Target Selection Complete . Begin Match with Type-B attachments . Target One , lnvestigator Iria . Target Two , Name Unknown . It must be Teppei ! Target Three , lnvestigator Fujikuro . You have ten minutes to equip yourselves . I will signal when the time is up . Over . It 's definitely not over . Live ammunition will be used . Ouch ! Hey , there 's a force field over here ! Bob , that shock , was it ... It looks like it . Everyone was transported into a Zone . The department 's robot is impressive . The Zone is nearly perfect . Strange ... This must be Teppei . He 's at the factory . What ? This is no good . We 've lost Iria and the other two . The Zone 's frequency is different from ours . What ? Come ... We 're going to ambush it . It started to move . It 's fast ! Watch out , it is hiding nearby . Changing to D type weapon Hey , are they going to be all right ? I don 't know , I 'm analyzing its data right now . Oh ! You don 't learn , do you ? Iria , a section of its shield has been broken . Iria , the suit 's shield is damaged . If you get hit now , you 're in danger . It 's the same with him . Good move , the rest of its shield is gone now . Thanks , Bob . It 's nice to have a good partner , right ? So , how are you going to get me ? Iria , I don 't want this communication monitored . Scramble the frequency . I understand . Shit ! How 's that ? Can you hear me ? What 's this ? Answer me . Okay , that 's fine . I will send a transporter unit there . Once you meet Teppei , send me the code I will get you out of there . Remember , you two have to be together . I 'll find Teppei . I 'm right here . Teppei , where are you now ? I 'm saved ! But , are you all right , Iria ? I heard a loud explosion . I thought you would be there , but I got caught by this strange guy . Damn it , who cares about the strange guy ? Iria 's asking where you are now . Where am I ? Oh , is that you Kamiya ? I knew you 'd come ! Yeah , yeah , whatever . Hey , your job is over now , right ? Can you go and pick him up now ? I don 't know where I am , either . Can you see something from where you are ? I can see a large abandoned structure . An abandoned structure ? The garbage disposal plant ! We once went to see the compactor around back , near the Kannon statue . Can I reach it from here ? No , I think it 'd be easier for Teppei to go and find you . Oh ... Where was the Kannon statue again ? Get back on the street and make a right . Right ... Oh , I got it . You really are bad with directions ! Sorry . I 'm relieved to hear your voices . Now , all we have to do is find a way back . I have my car so we should be able to get back in 40 minutes or so , if there 's no traffic . That 's not what she means ! Then what do you mean ? We 're stuck in a Zone . It can 't be ! It is . So , you 're saying that we 've been trapped again ? Don 't worry , you 'll be out of there in time for your wedding tomorrow . Don 't be so irresponsible . You don 't know what it 's like in here . Whose saying I 'm irresponsible ? I 'm saying you 're irresponsible ! You 're saying I 'm irresponsible ? Oh , don 't give me that ! You have no idea how worried I was ... You have no idea how worried I was ... You forgot my wedding ! You have no idea how worried I was ... You forgot my wedding ! You forgot my wedding ! Enough ! Stop it , both of you ! You just have to trust me , I will get Teppei home . Please help him . Don 't worry , I never let my partners down . Kamiya ... What ? Teppei ... Yes ? When we get back , I 'll buy you two a drink . To celebrate our reunion , right ? That 's not bad ! That 's right , I 'd like to see the three of you together , too . You will , soon . She 's gonna buy us some drinks ! What , are you drunk already ? No , I am attempting to express my joy . You are one funny guy , as always ! Iria , something 's beginning to move ! This is bad . It says Target Number Two Locked On . It 's Teppei . What 's going on ? A small missile is headed towards Teppei . What ? Iria ? Bob ? I 'm locked in . What ? What happened to the missile ? It 's here ... Is there any way you can get out of there ? Can you break down the door ? No chance , if only my suit was functional ... Iria ? Teppei ? I 'll open it now . That 's odd , it 's not working . Teppei , try turning the middle one . What ? It doesn 't open ! I know the problem , it 's outside . Go around the plant and get right behind the wall . Outside ? Yeah , that 's right . We checked the outside circuit there together , remember ? Yes . So , you get over there now and I 'll give you instructions . Gee , you 're starting to sound like the boss . Go already . Right . Preparing to re-initialize Oh ! I found it , Kamiya ! What do you mean you found it ? What took you so long ? But ... Now , do exactly what I say . All right . Look for the circuit labeled PN-5 . It 's right here . If there 's a wire loose , reconnect it . I connected it . Okay , then turn it on . Hey partner ! Working hard , are you ? Racking up overtime ? You relax here , okay ? Even if you try this again , it won 't work . Shut up ! What ... What happened ? Damn you ... Oh ! So , you had it . You ... W-W-Wait , wait , wait . Listen , don 't let your foot up . If you do , it will go boom ! What ? Hey , do something ! I 'll give you these , so stay cool ! I don 't need these things ! What 's going on ? Kamiya , help , I don 't know what to do ! What ? Fine , I 'll go in . But , it is too dangerous in the Zone . They are already inside it ... But , this is our problem . It 's wrong to get you involved . That 's stupid , Teppei is already involved . Besides , I 'm the one who fixed you up , right ? Right , you have a point ... So , don 't say anymore . Just tell me what I have to do out there . How do I deactivate those bombs and mines ? Well ? All right , I 'll explain it to you . Kamiya ! Did you call me , my Bridegroom ? Kamiya ! Am I great or what ? Geez , this is heavy . Cut me free ! All right . There ... There she is ! Iria , Iria ... Oh , that 's right . That 's ugly . Kamiya ? Sorry I 'm late . You can let it go . Are you all right ? Iria , answer us ! I 'm fine . I guess I owe you one again . It 's no big deal . It 's good to have someone who can help . You 're right . Come over here , and let me see your face . Go to the conveyor belt . It 's a bit far , but I will tell you how to get there . I 'm going now . Hey wait a minute , can you stick your hand out ? It 's my good luck charm . Take it with you . Thank you . Now that I 'm here , there is nothing to worry about . But your face ... That was something ! Kamiya ! My foot was on a mine ! What was that ? Kamiya ! It 's free ! Run ! W-Wait ! Are you guys all right ? Answer me ! They must have been blown clear by the blast . You better find them quickly . Teppei , Kamiya ... Answer me if you hear me ! Yes , hello ! Are you two all right ? Looks like I am . Kamiya , are you alright ? I hurt my back . He 's all right . Iria is looking for you . As soon as you three get together , use the Transportation Unit . Transportation Unit ? He said Transportation Unit , Kamiya ! It 's right here . Where ? Where ? Gone ! No ! Bye , partners . Iria , the transportation unit was taken by Fujikuro . What ? You made a wrong turn . What ? Hey , let me go ! Let me outta here ... Hey , hey ! Let me outta here ... Let me ... How is Fujikuro ? I put him in a holding cell . Serves him right . It 's not funny . What ? That was our last unit . What ? That means ... That 's right , I can 't bring the three of you back now . The only thing I can think of is the Kamarite Fujikuro tried to steal . Bob , we 'll use the Kamarite then . What are you saying ? We 've spent so much time and effort to recover it . Bob , no matter how valuable it is , that thing is still a transportation device . Bringing the three of us back is top priority right now . Bob ? Understood , I agree with you . Tell me where it is . Okay , it 's on top of a tower-like structure . A tower-like structure ... There ... Hey Teppei , let 's take a break . I don 't think she 's here yet . The Great Kannon statue is 111 .9 meters . The size of a 33 story building ? I 'm starving . Would you like some ? Yuck , take it away . What 's that ? Looks like ammunition . I can 't eat bullets . Hey Teppei ... I was going to tell you when we got back ... Tomorrow , my kid 's going to play the piano at a school concert . School concert ? My wife called yesterday . She told me that I could come see her play if I feel like it . You mean your wife is finally going to forgive you ? Well I dunno yet , but the thing is ... How can I put this ? Tomorrow is our anniversary . Then , that makes it two of us . Yes . Let 's celebrate our anniversaries together next year . Yeah . So , that 's why I can 't go to your wedding . I 'm very sorry . Don 't be silly . But , why were you asking me about Akemi 's shoe size earlier ? Well , I decided to buy a new pair of shoes for my wife . Remember , when all of us were drunk at my apartment ? Akemi put on my wife 's shoe , and said that it fit perfectly ! Remember that ? Now , I know from experience that a nice pair of shoes is a good gift for a woman . All right then ! Tomorrow , be a good father and husband ! That 's great , do your best ! Why is it you cheering me on ? Now , don 't be shy ... You 're an excellent , mature , 50 something man ... Who is 50 something ? Who is 50 something ? Well , Teppei ? Are you two having fun ? Iria , where are you now ? I think I am pretty close to you . Can you see the face of the Kannon statue from there ? Not from here . Then , maybe she 's behind the statue . You should see the entrance at the bottom of her feet , though . I see it . Great , go inside though that . We 're going in the front entrance . All right , I 'll see you inside . Good , let 's go . Hey Kamiya , I heard a strange sound . Kamiya , Kamiya ? Run ! Who the hell is that ? We shouldn 't be resting ! Teppei , this way . Right ! Kamiya , through here . Hey Teppei ... Teppei , I 'm stuck . What are you doing ? Stop pulling so hard . Teppei , Teppei ... Stop ! Your opponent is right here . Iria , the staircase is over here . All right , you two go ahead . All right . Good luck . Kamiya , hurry . Teppei , Teppei ... How many more flights do we have to go ? Just shut up and climb . Where is it ? The Kamarite is outside . It 's stuck on a ledge . Outside ? There . We can move this ... Strong wind ... Go on ! Me ? Watch out ! There it is ! Oh no ! He 's trying to disintegrate the whole Zone . Kamiya , help me . I 'm coming . I 'm coming . Teppei , don 't move . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Kamiya , where 's the Kamarite ? Kamarite ? Oh , here it is ! I thought you dropped it . We did it , we 're saved ! Iria ? Let 's go ! Yes . What the hell is this thing , anyway ? Go away ! Bad dog ! It smells terrible ! Go away ! Ouch , ouch , ouch ! Oh , Kamiya your arm ! Take it off ! Nice kick ! Well , I 'll be a papa soon , so ... Papa ? Let 's go inside , Kamiya . Papa ? Never mind , hurry . Papa ? Hey , we got it . What are we supposed to do ? First , pull the base . The base ? Hey , the color changed . Okay , that 's a good sign . The energy hasn 't been drained yet . Now , when Iria joins you , all you have to do is to push the base back in . Got it . All right . Run ! Teppei , this way ! There 's another one out there . Let 's hide ! Kamiya , what are you holding ? Huh ? What are you talking about ? Where 's the Kamarite ? Look for it ! You gotta be kidding ! It 's not here ! Kamiya , there ! There it is ! Let 's go ! Right . Where , where ? Which one is it ? Where the hell is it ? I don 't know ! Iria , what are you doing ? You 'll be blown up with him ! There , there it is ! This is it ! The field is reaching it 's final limit . You have to move fast , or you won 't be able to get out of there . I know that ! We made it ! No , look . Iria ! We lost her . No , Iria is here . Is this Iria ? Yes it is . Then get her back . I can 't do that . How come ? Look at it carefully . There are two lights . One is Iria , the other is Zeiram . Which one is Iria ? I 've never retrieved a Kamarite transportation , so I can 't tell which is which . What ? You were able to tell us apart okay . That 's right ! You 're supposed to be good at analyzing data and everything , aren 't you ? The entire system is new to me . In fact , it 's a mircale this ancient device transported and reconstructed you safely . No ... Furthermore there is only enough energy in the Kamarite to reconstruct one more person . So , what do we do now ? Look down at your feet . There are two levers . Of those two , one will reconstruct Iria . I would like you two to choose . Us ? Iria told me once ... Human intuition is more reliable than any logical analysis I can make . But , how do we know which is which ? I 'm asking you as partners . I 'm sure Iria feels the same way . You guys are really something . All the damned way to the end . Kamiya ? Remember , when she gets back . She promised to buy us drinks . You did it ! It 's Iria 's data ! Something 's gone wrong ! Zeiram is also trying to reconstruct himself ! Thank you . He 's completely destroyed now . It 's good to see you two again .

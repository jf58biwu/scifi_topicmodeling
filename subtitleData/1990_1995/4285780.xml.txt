 It 's that time of year , when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike . The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart . Every day I strive to make that dream come true . I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze . The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter . If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide . Bright shining clouds drift by . Miku Under Suspicion ! To the 20 million Neo Women 's Pro Wrestling fans across the country thank you for your patience . Now , we finally bring to you the second match of the Universal Championship . We are here at the Big Tokyo Dome where the hugely popular TWP 's Pretty Four will meet the AWP Maskers ! Pretty Nana grabs her by the arm and flings her towards the ropes ! A jump and a spectacular kick ! Wow ! Now from the top rope ... Elbow Drop ! Ginko ! Yo ! The Pretty Four switch off , fast and early . Next in is the hard fighting Pretty Ginko ! Pretty Ginko 's high powered attack ! And finally , the Star of the Beauties , Pretty Miku makes her appearance ! The audience is chanting for the Pretty Four . Their popularity is unbelievable . Go , Miku ... Harajuku , the head of the TWP is looking pretty happy . She does it ! Pretty Miku 's drop kick ! Wow ! Dynamite Keiko has panicked and dropped the energy ball . This is Pretty Miku 's chance to finish her off . What ? But Miku switches off with Sayaka . Silly ! Pretty Sayaka furiously charges ! Do it , Sayaka ! One , two , three ... A full count ! The Pretty Four win ! I don 't like it . I don 't want to see his smiling face again ! If your attack with the Lady Ninjas hadn 't failed ... Now listen , Nagoya , listen here ... What , a trainee ? You 'll need a stand in if one of you gets hurt . Besides , she 's really passionate about Pro Wrestling . What do you think ? For a while , we 'll have her clean and do the laundry . My name is Maki Yoshihara , pleased to meet you . Hey , I think it 's great . She 's got a great face and a great body . Great pop star material . Can you sing ? Honey ! Eiichi , what do you think ? So , we get another half-assed wrestler . It doesn 't make a difference to me . Thank you so much ! Thank you everyone ! I 'm a huge fan of the Pretty Four ! You 're strong , you 're cute , and you have great bodies ! I think you 're awesome ! I 'll do anything , just tell me . Looking forward to working with you . Nice to meet you . Where are you from ? Hokkaido . Oh , so that 's why your skin is so nice . Being a trainee is a lot of hard work . Hang in there . I 'm prepared for it . But thank you so much for sharing your room with me . Oh , no problem . I 'm so happy that I get to share a room with you Miku . Why ? Because , you 're the best of the Pretty Four . No , that 's not true . I 've got a long way to go . The fans all think you 're the best . Really ? Yeah . If there 's anything you need , let me know . I 'll do whatever I can to help . Really ? Thank you . What 's wrong , had enough ? No , I 'm fine . No good , take five and start again . Right ! Next , Sayaka and Nana . What are you doing ? Get your butts in the ring . Yes ! Excuse me , I 've finished cleaning over here . Shall I go do the laundry next ? Please ! Okay ! She 's really into it . She 's got guts . Great kid . You shouldn 't be so relaxed with her . Perhaps you should think about what it means to you to have a new girl come in . Maki ! Kinta ! The laundry room ... What 's the matter ? Are you okay ? Y-Yeah , I plugged it in and got shocked . Sorry to cause a commotion . Are you sure you 're okay ? Hey ... What ? It looks like someone cut it with a knife . I wonder who did it ? It wasn 't me . No one said it was . Must be a coincidence . Maybe it just looked like it was cut with a knife . I hope so . What are you trying to say ? What Coach was saying ... If Maki becomes a regular , that means one of us would have to step down . So , are you saying one of us did it to try to get rid of Maki ? That 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . Besides , she 's just a trainee . Maybe we 're being paranoid . O-Ouch , ouch ! Sorry . There , finished . You totally exaggerate . It 's just a little burn on your finger . What do you mean , I could have totally burned my entire body ! But is does seem strange that the water would be so hot . I got it ! Someone messed with the temperature control on the water heater . Huh ? What ? Is this someone 's idea of a prank ? That 's a pretty horrible prank ! Did someone really meddle with it ? All I mean is , that it 's possible that someone meddled with it . So then , it could also mean that it 's just broken . There 's no one here who would do such a thing . Yeah , you 're right , but ... Miku 's right . There 's no one here who would do such a thing . Besides , you girls don 't need to think about that sort of thing . You need to concentrate on your next fight . Right , everyone ? Yes ! Sorry , but I don 't have anything to give you for your article ... They 're not even close . Yes , but Mr. Suo , you did take them on . The way I see it , you 're looking to turn that Miku into another Aquamarine . Nonsense . But you did take the first step in a new direction . What 's the deal ? I can 't move . Ouch , my back is going to break . Kinta ! What are you doing ? No good , I can 't control it ! Ginko ! Nana ! Help ! Let us go ! This is going to kill us ! What are you doing ? I can 't disengage the locks . Cut the power to the main computer ! Right ! Nana ! Ginko ! Are you okay ? I think I 'm going to puke . I feel like I 'm gonna die . Is anyone hurt ? What happened ? It 's my fault ! If I 'd only kept the machines up better . No . Yesterday 's accidents , and now today 's incidents someone 's behind this . I agree , someone is trying to mess with us . W-What ? Well , what else could it be ? Wait a minute , who would do such a thing ? It 's not me ! I know I 'm the new person here , but I would never do such a thing . No one is accusing you , Maki . Yeah , Maki , you 're a victim too . So who here hasn 't been attacked ? What , me ? Are you serious ? Where 's that going to get you , suspecting one of your own ? Look , there are only you girls here in this gym . Please get along . What 's so funny ? It is possible that someone here is responsible for this . With that the new trainee coming in it 's not out of the question that one of the four regulars is feeling threatened . What are you saying ? Mr. Suo , are you trying to make matter worse ? It 's not me . It 's not me either . Me neither . If it 's not you , prove it . I want to see you all in the gym in ten minutes . Miku ! Eiichi has an idea , let 's leave it up to him . Coach ! Coach , do you think I did it too ? Do you know what your weakness is ? You 're worst quality came out in the last fight . I 'm going to show you what it is right now . Coach ... My weakness ? All here ? I want everyone in the ring . Shifty maneuvers are the trademark of someone who lacks confidence . If you are sure of your skills , you don 't need to try to corner someone . What are we doing ? Battle Royale . No armor , just you . See for yourselves where you stand in the TWP . No ring outs allowed . The first person to lose is the culprit . What ? Coach ! This is crazy ! How can you find the culprit like this ? The gong went off . Look behind you . I can 't do this . But if you lose now , that makes you the culprit . You 're the one ! Miku , don 't take this personally . Ginko ! Mr. Suo , what are you doing ? Have you lost your mind ? Making them fight each other to find the culprit ? Yeah , coach , what are you thinking ? Miku ! Miku , why won 't you fight ? Because ... In the last match you had the chance to finish it , but you didn 't ! This is your biggest weakness . The mat is a jungle and everyone is a beast . Even your friends are the enemy , and only the strong survive . That is where a true champion is born . Niceties have no place in the ring . Got it ? Yes ! Then go ! Yes ! Here I come ! So this wasn 't to find the culprit ? What , back already ? Yep , you owe me big . Just tell me . No more . No , I can 't allow you to do this . Just as you thought , that girl is a Shibano Women 's Wrestling trainee . Maki is a Shibano trainee ? What ! You couldn 't be ... Well , now that you know . That 's right , I 'm Maki from Shibano . I came to check out your skills . So it was you who did all that ! You bitch , you 're not getting away with this . Wait , we 're still in the ring . Let me do it . Let 's fight . I 'll take you on Miku . Miku ! Miku , fight ! You 're finished ! Super Miku Kick ! One , two , three ... Yay ! Miku . That was a good fight , let 's do it again sometime in front of a full house . I think we can call it quits for the day . Yes ! Father ! How dare you use one of our precious trainees as a spy without even telling me ! First you use the Lady Ninjas to launch an attack now this girl is saying she can 't be here anymore . She left ! Father ! Why are you so obsessed the TWP ? Father , what 's the deal with you and Harajuku ? Father ! He used to bully you ? Well , it wasn 't like he always beat me up . They 've been going at it since they were kids . How ridiculous . And you 're still going at it ? It 's his fault ! Ten years ago Shibano tried to develop this area . Father got talked into being the opposition leader then he found out that Shibano was behind the project , he got all scared ! No , that 's not true we won that time too . So that 's all the more reason Shibano 's pissed off with you . I-I 'm not afraid of him . Don 't worry , we 'll definitely beat him when it comes to Pro Wrestling . Yeah , and together , we can make it to the championship ! I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile . Cheer up ! An angel without wings is just an ordinary person . Plain old hard work is more important than magic . In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest . Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats . Put your hands in your pockets . One day , they will come true the dreams that only you can dream . Miku takes a tumble and hurts her shoulder really bad . The doctor came and said she can 't fight in the next match ! But I 'll be rooting for you from the side lines ! Good luck guys ! Next time ... Miku Turns Into a Chicken . Miku 's Elbow Maneuver !

 LEA ( VOICEOVER ) : Dear diary , the war , when it came , lasted just a day . That 's all it took . No one even knows who started it or what it was all about . But it was the aftermath that took its final toll on civilization . What was left of humanity began to wipe itself out , finally , rebelling against the conspiracy of the capitalist elite and the military establishment that had resulted in cataclysmic annihilation . I was too little to remember what it was like before the war . Mommy told me of great , shining cities on a hill , and a thousand points of light , and of a little house they owned in a town called Tromaville . But that was in the past . My childhood was a brief , catatonic pause . Then , one day , I woke up a woman . I 'm the daughter of a new age . The radiation that finished off humanity has created ghastly mutations . It 's turned our pets and livestock into gargantuan , horrifying creatures . Now Tromaville has become a dinosaur hell . And to survive , I 've become a barbarian , but not just any kind of barbarian . Because sometimes my juices start to flow and I feel like a nymphoid . And it 's become harder and harder and harder than ever to find a decent boyfriend . So I guess you could say I 've become a nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell ! [ whimpering ] [ thunk ] Bitch . [ screaming ] We have to go . Where ? Three times we 've been attacked . Come on . Wait . Come on . No . Come on . You go . No . - Oh , come on . - No . No . [ grunting ] Beware the Jabberwock , my son , the jaws that bite , the claws that catch . Beware the Jubjub bird , and shun the frumious Bandersnatch . He took his vorpal sword in hand , long time the manxome foe he sought ... so rested he by the Tumtum the tree and stood a while in thought . And , as in uffish thought , he stood , the Jabberwock , with eyes aflame , came whiffling through the tulgey wood , and burbled as it came . One , two , one , two , and through and through , the vorpal blade went snicker-snack . He left it dead , and with its head , he went galumphing back . He heareth not . He stirreth not . He moveth not . The ape is dead . Or mayhap not . So you live after all , eh ? Ah well . Come to my arms , my beamish boy . A frabjous day ! Callooh ! Callay ! He chortled in his joy . Ah , so there is life in you yet . Who are you ? By what name are you called ? Who are you ? An old man , a digger of things that were . Who 's Lea ? You mutter in your sleep . A woman . They took her . I 've got to get her back . You 're not rescuing anybody just yet , old friend . You just narrowly escaped the gaping maw of death yourself . Get some sleep . Come the morrow , you can regale me with your tale of woe , you little chatterbox . Just get some sleep . Good lord , you look fit for a man who was half-dead last night . You must have the most incredible recuperative power . Off on a quest , eh ? Still determined to rescue your lady love ? What was she like then ? Like ? What was she like ? Dark or fair ? Tall or short ? Lean or stout ? She was beautiful . Yes , I 'm sure she was . Look , far be it from me to dissuade you from this noble cause , but what I mean to say is , by the time you catch them , if you catch them , what 's the point , really ? I mean , all you can really hope for is revenge . And what 's the point in that , after all ? I 'm going . Thanks . I certainly admire your pigheadedness . Come here . I have been places and seen things your young eyes wouldn 't believe . I 'll tell you , this world has known wonders far beyond your imagining . Like this . Do you know what this is ? This is a weapon , a powerful weapon . Watch me carefully . Hold it like this . This thing here 's the trigger . You aim , Like a crossbow . You squeeze the trigger . Beats your swords and axes , eh ? Here . You 'll need this if you 're to have any chance of rescuing the lady fair . But be careful . I don 't know how many shots it has left . Don 't waste them . Do you understand me ? Thank you . Bye . Good luck . Just as well . I was tired of his constant chatter . [ roaring ] [ screaming ] [ inaudible ] . And then two more came out of nowhere . Four of them attacked us . A tall man with scars and ... And three things with skin like lizards . So they killed your friend . He 's not dead , but I can 't find my way back . Can you help me ? Did you make that ? No , I found it . Where ? I 'll show you after we ... after we eat . [ clang ] Apple . Round . Food . You wanna see ? Look . No . Take a good look . [ shouting ] I have to go . I have to find Marn . Marn . You belong to him . We 'll find him . [ growling ] She 's mine . Take her . What are you waiting for ? All right . We 'll do it here then . [ screaming ] Is there a girl ? Which way ? Which way did they take her ? Marn ? You came . Finally , before I kill you . The hell with you . You 're lizard meat . Do what you want with her .

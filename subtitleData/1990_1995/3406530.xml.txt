A very , very busy crime scene here , and , uh , we 'll be right back with more , uh , right after this ... Well , were you here when this happened ? - I need a couple pictures out here , Jack . - Uh , back to you , Jim . Oh ! Mom , please take her out of here , please . Nurse ! Get a gurney , get an orderly , stat . Hi . Hi . Come here , honey . Come on , honey . My God . What have I become ? I 'm telling you , man . This place is completely fucking outrageous . It 's - - it 's outrageous , man . Come on , check it out . - Looks pretty wild . - It is , man . - It 's big , huh ? - Yeah . Yeah , a pretty large place . I 'm telling you , man . This is gonna be a rave they 're gonna be talking about for years - - the underground of undergrounds , a party to end all parties . - Whoa . - Come on , guys . - Hey . - Whoo ! - Look at these ceilings . - Yeah . All right ! Look at that . We could burn this place down , man . Far fuckin ' out . This way , man , over here . Come on , check it out . You got the main hall upstairs , then you got this level . People could just chill . Maybe we could put a bar down here , man . Hey , there 's more down below . I 'm telling you , man , this place just goes on and on . Whoo ! People can just explore . I want to call it " Bad to the Max . " I like it . It 's got potential . It 's got a lot of potential . Let 's get outta here . We 've got a rave to promote . Yes . This place is fucking great . You 're a fucking genius , Stanton . Do you hear that ? You 're fucking out of this world . Yes ... I am at that . You coming , or what ? Later . Yo , what the hell you think you 're doing ? - These are car keys . - Yeah , what 's it to you ? - I like cars . - Yeah ? I like cars , too . Now , get lost , okay ? What the ... Hey , man , you want it , take it ! J-Jesus , it 's only a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . - Let 's just leave , okay ? - Uh , yeah . Hmm . - Mmm . - What the hell 's going on here ? Hmm . Look , man , I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . You don 't , and I 'm calling the cops . Can 't you see I 'm eating ? Eat this , asshole . Don 't ever , ever bother me while I 'm eating . I like this . " Stun gun - - give ' em a jolt they 'll never forget . " I like this a lot . Oh . Oh , I want this car . Are you the valet ? - I like this car . - Yeah , kid , I don 't blame you . Look , uh , take this , put this towards a down payment . And send me over a valet , will you , please ? But I want this car . He wants this car . - And I want the girl . - Oh , he wants ... What are ... Hey , stop that . Hey , what are you ... Stop ! Let me out ! Let me out ! Along with his stolen Corvette , the fianc√©e ofnoted industrialist William Brockhurst , Jr . , was found dead at the old Grayson Steel Mill after being abducted earlier this evening . It is believed that the suspect may have been involved in several other brutal incidents in the vicinity earlier today . You can go for them or me , not both . One or the other , motherfucker . One or the other ! Gotta go . Bye . I 've already sent for backup . It didn 't help last time . You lose , sucker . Wrong , motherfucker , you lose . Here 's your father , Police Detective Thomas Beck . They , uh , found him by the old Grayson Steel Mill . It seems like he 'd been in one heck of a fight . I gotta tell you , we see a lot of weird things , but this was pretty strange for such an old man . My father wasn 't old . Well , somebody should 've told him that . That 's not my father . Look , I just work here . I 'm telling you , that 's not him . I hadn 't seen him in a couple of years , but he was only 48 . You don 't believe me ? Look . Listen , lady , all I know is dental records don 't lie . Excuse me ? Well , he came in as a John Doe . They used dental records to , uh , make positive ID . I 'm sorry . I 'll , uh , give you a few minutes alone . What happened to you ? Goddamn it , what happened to you ? Don 't ! No . Okay . Okay , okay , please . Please , I 'll do anything you want , just don 't hurt me , please . Sit . Cut yourself . Huh ? You heard me ... cut yourself . You gotta be kidding . Not kidding . Small , on the finger . Just enough to draw blood . Do it ! The knife . Slowly . The other hand , hold it out . I thought you were one of them , I 'm sorry . One of " them " ? One of them . Or one of us . What do you mean ? I suppose it was hidden from you all these years . Hidden ? What ? The truth about your father . Get dressed . Now . My clothes are in there . I 'll be right outside this door . What about my father was hidden ? That he was not of this planet . Right . And I suppose you 're an alien , too ? Yes . Great , this is just great . The message we received was garbled and unintelligible , but what we did get indicated there might have been a spawning . A spawning ? That and the name of your father , Thomas Beck . We tried . There was nothing more we could decipher from the message . The trail dead-ends with him . I got here too late . Look , what exactly is it that you want with me ? - Your help . - My help ? You have a very peculiar way of asking for someone 's help . Well , I 'm sorry about before . I did what I had to do . But I meant you no harm . Right . Look , the fact that you need help is very clear . And I 'd really like to help you . Good . Let 's get started , then . No . You see , what you need is psychological help . You don 't believe a word I said , do you ? You are one mixed-up , complex human being . Get back . Now do you believe me ? Your body ... where did you ... I mean , how did you ... The life force had already departed . You mean ... dead ? Not dead . Not alive . Sort of like a machine left running , but that which you call the soul had already left . This body was no longer important to it . This is too weird . I have to find the ones who came before me . Especially the one named Rautus . Rautus . It butchered countless of my people . Who knows what it might have done here . It ? The closest concept you have , you people , is of evil incarnate . Less than a man , but more than an animal . His kind , they kill for pleasure , take indiscriminately . Our fear is that it might have spawned . Let 's hope that it hasn 't . - Your father ? - Yeah . Then after my , uh , mom died , he withdrew , lived like a hermit . I hadn 't seen him in a couple of years . I tried ... but he wouldn 't let me . I 'm sorry . I guess I didn 't really know him . Look , what exactly are we looking for anyway ? Anything out of the ordinary , possible clues he may have left behind . You ? Yeah . Did you love him ? Well , yeah . He was my dad . That was a long time ago . This is all the stuff that I have of his . It doesn 't seem like that much to go on . No . I need to see where he lived . I can 't believe he lived like this . Whoa . Put that away . Don 't you think it might cause too much attention ? - But this place , it 's empty . - Trust me on this . Besides , this will probably be a lot easier . Probably a lot quieter , too . Well , he 's either very efficient ... Or ? ... or very narcissistic . What do you mean ? He worked his way out in concentric circles . That 's very efficient . What about the other possibility ? He just enjoyed surrounding himself with his handiwork - - mayhem and death . Either way , he may have become one of them . You don 't mean that , uh that he was responsible for this , these - - these murders ? I 'm sorry . I wish I could make it different . Underneath the surface , you and I are not that different . We , uh , just walk in a different physical body . I am not the enemy . Yeah . It did spawn . How do you know ? In that dog . These things they 're perfect killing machines . They stay in hibernation until the conditions are right . The conditions may have changed . They take what they want when they want it . They use up a host body , throw it out and move on to the next . Wait . Wait a minute . You 're telling me that these things are out there , and we 're planning to go after them alone ? What , are you nuts ? We tell the authorities , they 'll put me in an insane asylum . Now , if I prove to them who and what I am , they 'll turn me into a scientific specimen . There are no alternatives . Your people have nothing capable of stopping them . Nothing . They will destroy you people , and they will enjoy doing it . This is the only weapon that can kill them . Let 's just hope we find them before it 's too late . Great . This is just great . They would never have spawned here , it 's too open , vulnerable . Wait . - What 's that ? - What ? That , off in the distance . I don 't know . A motor of some sort . No . Music . You said they come out of hibernation when the conditions are right . What did you mean ? Warmth , humidity the proximity of living human flesh . Potential hosts . We need to check the lower levels . Look , would they really be in a place like this ? This place , these people would be perfect for them . Once they come out of hibernation , they could be in anybody . You like that ? Very good . They 're here . Let 's go , now . - Just leave ? What about these ? - There 's no time to explain . One of them 's already gone . That 's much more dangerous . We 'll come back for these later . Hey , come on . Sorry . Hey . Okay . Wait here . I 'll be back . - Come on , man . - Ow ! Hey , asshole . We have to stop it before it transfers again . What , that woman ? It saw you , so you 're in danger . If it comes after you , this will slow it down . - It won 't kill it ? - No . Now , listen , we don 't have much time , so listen carefully . The only way to stop it is to force it out of the human host . Shoot to kill , not wound . Aim for the head and the vital organs . When the body 's no longer able to function , it 'll have to come out . - Then we 're to kill it with this . - But I 've never shot a gun in my life . Let 's hope you won 't have to . Hey , I gotta tell you , I never kiss on a first date . - Interesting . - Yeah . Different . Hey , what the ... What ? - Get off of me . - Come on , man . You looking for me ? Now you 've really pissed me off . You okay ? He 'll have to change . We must hurry . Hey , man . What the ... Let 's go . That 's not him . Fuck you . Without this you 're nothing . You 're not even worth killing . You couldn 't hurt me now if you tried . Fuck you , asshole . Are you all right ? Am I all right ? No , I am definitely not all right . There 's nothing that can stop that thing , nothing . I am anything but all right . Well , what about my father 's weapon ? Huh ? My dad had a weapon just like that . Check in with me in five minutes . It 's one of the night guards . All right , listen carefully , whatever happens , you find that weapon . Now , if I 'm shot , if I 'm injured , even if I 'm killed , you leave , I 'll find you later . You gotta be kidding . - What , as someone else ? - If that 's necessary . Hurry . Masterson , it looks like we have a situation down here . Looks like a break and enter . - Got it . - Let 's go . Now ! You know , you 're very good at this . Yeah ? Maybe I have a future in crime . So , what now ? We go back for the others . Before it 's too late . You know , you sure know how to show a gal a good time . You know , we haven 't much time . We better ... get on with it . Yeah . The weapon . The weapon , now . Shoot me . Now , goddamn it ! Do it ! Thanks . I needed that . I thought I killed you . The weapon has no effect on human flesh . It 's the wrong composition . You 're cut . Hazard of the trade . - It doesn 't look too deep , though . - I think I 'll survive . So , won 't these spawn , too ? Can 't . Only the fully mature ones can when they metamorphose . - So , what do we do now ? - There 's no choice but to wait . Wait ? That thing is out there , and you intend just to wait ? There 's no way to track it . It will come back here , but first it will have to go through the metamorphosis . Then , and only then , will it return to protect its siblings . But they 're dead . I know that , and you know that , but it doesn 't . I intend to be here when it returns . How can we just leave them there ? The metamorphosis won 't happen for another 12-14 hours . So , in the meantime , there 's no reason to stay , as long as I 'm back before it returns . What 's wrong ? What is it ? It 's nothing . Just give me a moment . Are you okay ? This body , it needs , uh fuel . Oh , it 's nothing . Really . So , what the hell happened to you back there ? I told you , this body , it needs fuel . Look , I 've seen hunger , I know hunger , and that wasn 't just hunger . No . This body also needs rest . Food and rest ? You expect me to buy that ? Food and rest ... Yes . I 'd like you to buy that . I have no money . Oh , that 's where I went to school . You went to school here ? Yeah , Clinical Psych . Got my residency , too . " Osu . " No , OSU . It 's a university . It 's a university . Yeah . Your people ... very interesting people . Okay . Here , um , why don 't you try this ? It might be a little easier . Mmm . This is good , this food . Mmm . Um ... what 's it like where you 're from ? Different . Tell me about it . Well , for one , there 's no Chinese food . No , really , what 's it like ? It 's very different . It 's like nothing in your experience . Well , describe it . I wanna know . Energy , light . No physical body , just being . We feel , but ... not as you do . We sense , but it 's not concrete . It 's real , but not solid . We live in spirit , not in body . Hmm . Sounds like heaven . Like heaven ? Like heaven but not . A hunger within to feel , to touch to breathe . My people , we have learned to live with it . We ... The others , they have not . They have evolved into the opposite - - purely carnal , physical , evil . We and they , we are the same . So those things ... Evolved from the same species . Here you go . The couch is all yours . Thank you . But what am I gonna do with it , this couch ? I 'm sure you 'll figure it out . And I 'll leave a toothbrush out for you . I 've got an extra one . Toothbrush . I 'm sorry . I forgot you 're not from around these parts . Here , let me show you . Now , first , you have toothpaste . It helps a lot . Go like this and that . Now , open up . Come on , try it . You 'll like it . Very good . Now ... And over here . Nice ? Ooh . Well , um ... You get the idea . This world of yours , it 's very beautiful . You sound sad . Well , to realize all the things you 've never had can make one sad . To feel , to touch to fill your lungs with crisp , fresh air to feel hunger and thirst even pain . All these things I 've never known before . - So much - - - Shh shh shh . Well , I ain 't what you need , but I 'm what you want You need someone to rely on But on the other hand Can I help you ? If you want a party man Well , I ain 't what you need , but I 'm what you want Yeah ! This music , it stinks . Huh ? I like this radio . Hey , now , wait a minute , partner . Where you going with that thing ? Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Be real careful with that . - Don 't touch that thing , man . - I gotta go now . Don 't put your hand on that , man . That 's real dangerous . Bye . How 's the car ? The car 's down . - Oh , holy cow ! - Oh , my God ! That 's what I 'm saying , you know ? I mean , it 's your world , I 'm just living in it , man . You hear the music ? Hey , yo , man , you 're in the wrong part of town . Hey , hey , hey , hey . You crazy upside your head , motherfucker ? - Look at that . - We gonna have some fun . Hey , man . Nice boom box , motherfucker . Nice car , motherfucker . Ooh ! Yeah . You got balls dissing me , man . Now , give me the fucking box and get your white ass outta here . Nice move . What the fuck is he doing ? I should do you right here , motherfucker . Huh ? Do him ! Goddamn . What the fuck ? C-Come on , get in there , man ! Wh-What the ... Come on , come on . Shit . Come on . Get - - get ... Hey . I said I like the car , motherfucker . Let 's drop this guy ! - Go ahead , try me . - Cool . You believe that ? Wasted him . The Caddies , khakis , beanies , and dookie braids Pimpin ' and livin because the system is fucked up Using any means necessary just to come up I send my girl out , I put a gat in her purse I say watch your back , keep movin ' , don 't sleep Cause slippin ' will get you got in some parts of IE I to the N - - Hey , are you all right ? Hey . Oh , my God . You 're burning up . - I 'm gonna get a doctor . - No doctor . - What are you talking about ? - No doctor ! Just give me a moment . This will pass . Physical contact is an absolute concentration . Talk to me . What is going on ? - Difficult to explain . - Try . Don 't know if you wanna know . I do . I can 't stay here forever . We change . Some sooner , some later , but for all of us it 's inevitable . What do you mean ? If we stay , we become like them - - purely physical . It eats away at us like a cancer . We can fight it for a while , but ultimately there 's nothing we can do about it . Hey , what the ... What 's going on ? Whatever , brother . You feeling okay , buddy ? Oh , now , wait a minute there , bud . Hey ! Someone better help him . You better go on in there , see what 's going on . You gotta be kidding me . This food ... not very good . Did you see that ? I appreciate your offer , but I have to do this alone . Look , I can 't just sit here waiting to find out what happened , wondering , worrying . It will already have metamorphosed . It 's too dangerous for you to come . I care for you . I care about you , too . It 's bad enough what will happen to me . It 's part of what I do , I 've come to accept that , but if anything were to happen to you ... I could never live with myself . And what about me ? I have feelings , too . Yes , but this is my battle . No . No , not anymore . Not since that thing came here 15 years ago . Not since I lost my father . Look , if we don 't destroy that thing now , it 's bad , right ? Eventually it 'll spawn again , and we 'll be in deep shit . " Deep shit . " Yes , your people will be in that . In that case ... I am coming with you . And if I can help just one little bit , it 'll be worth it . It will kill without hesitation . We must do the same . It will show no mercy . We must do likewise . It will be difficult to destroy . It will get ugly . I understand , but if not now , if not by us , then what ? We must hurry . Let 's rock and roll . It 's a figure of speech , you know , like " kick butt , " " ice the mother . " It 's time . We must hurry ! Get down ! Now aren 't you glad I came ? Listen , whatever happens , don 't let him take me . - Whatever you have to do , just do it . - When I come up firing , you take off . - What ? - Just run . Run like hell . If one of us comes out of this , at least there 's hope . - But - - - Just do it ! Now ! Juliet ! You son of a bitch . Eat this , motherfucker . It 's over . It 's okay . It 's over now . There 's just one more thing I have to do to prevent another spawning . But it 's over . Juliet . Move very slowly . - You all right ? - Yes . Oh . I guess this just ain 't my day . What 's wrong ? I can feel it inside me . - What ? - Change . If I stay it 's not gonna get any better . It 'll only get worse . Like my father ? What 's that ? Nothing . It 's a saying from our Book of Books . " The flower on the hill . " I 'd choose the few good years I could have here with you . - And all this and - - - Shh . I 've seen what it does , what it did to my father . I care about you too much for that . It 's the rest of the saying . " The flower on the hill , like a stranger in a strange land , it passes like the wind . "

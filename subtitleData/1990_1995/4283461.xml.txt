 ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) ( BOOMING VOICE ) Thomas Allman . Thomas Allman , you have been found unworthy of having existed . Mother ? Your life and all memory of you will be wiped from history . The void you occupied in the space-time continuum will be allocated to a person who was never given the gift of life . May they spend their time more wisely . ( WHOOSH ) Please . Why me ? There must be others who 've lived worthless lives . All will be judged . It is complete . All that remains is to delete your physical form . Sorry to disturb you , sir . Reality control . Coffee , sir . Double caffeinated , quadruple sugar . - Nice one . - Ah , Virgil 's " Aeneid " . Oh , the epic tale of Agamemnon 's pursuit of Helen of Troy , the classic work by the greatest Latin poet who ever lived . - Yeah , it 's the comic book version . - Really ? It 's good , man . Absolutely full of history . " Zap ! Pow ! Ker-splat ! Die in bed , you Trojan pig-dog ! Gnargh ! Ker-pow ! " I see they 've remained faithful to the original text . Don 't discourage him . It 's the only thing he 's read that doesn 't have lift-up flaps . I dunno though . This wooden horse malarkey , I 'm not buyin ' that . It 's the most famous military manoeuvre in history . The Greeks have been camped outside Troy , ker-powing and ker-splatting the Trojans for almost a decade , yeah ? - So ? - So suddenly , one morning , they 're gone . Outside the city walls , they 've left this gift , this tribute to their valiant foes , a huge wooden horse , just large enough to happily contain 500 Greeks in full battle dress and still leave adequate room for toilet facilities ? Not one Trojan goes , " That 's a bit of a funny pressie . " What 's wrong with socks and aftershave ? " No , they just wheel it in and go for an early night . People that stupid deserve to be ker-powed and ker-splatted in their beds . The joke is that from this , we derive the phrase " beware of Greeks bearing gifts " , when it would be more logical to say , " Beware of Trojans , they 're complete smegheads . " Well , thank you , AJP Taylor . - ( THUD ) - What was that ? - That 's strange . We 've changed course . - Are you sure , Holly ? - There 's no course change programmed . - ( THUD ) And again . Mark one eight zero - a complete turn . - We 're heading back to Red Dwarf . - Give me manual . - Agh ! - We 're locked out ! - Something 's controlling the craft . - Holly , any traffic around ? - Nothing on the local scan . - There must be ... ( BOOMING VOICE ) I am in possession of the human Lister . Do not resist me . What happened to him ? His voice finally break ? - Who are you ? - Tremble at my name . I am the Inquisitor . - The Inquisitor ? - Your vessel is under my control . It will return you to your mother ship to face judgement . You will each present a case to justify your existence . If you fail , you will be deleted . - Are you OK , sir ? - Yeah . God , I think so . - A little bit shaky . - We should run you through the medi-scan . Yeah , OK . So , Kryten , you 've heard of this Inquisitor ? Only as a myth , a dark fable , a horror tale , told across the flickering embers of a midnight fire wherever hardened space dogs gather to drink fermented vegetable products and compete in tales of blood-chilling terror . A simple " yes " would have sufficed . - So who is he ? - What 's his beef ? Well , the legend tells of a droid , a self-repairing simulant , who survives till the end of eternity , to the end of time itself . After millions of years alone , he finally reaches the conclusion that there is no God , no afterlife , and the only purpose of existence is to lead a worthwhile life . And so the droid constructs a time machine and roams eternity , visiting every single soul in history and assessing each one . He erases those who wasted their lives and replaces them with those that never had a chance of life , the unfertilised eggs , the sperms that never made it . That is the Inquisitor . He prunes away the wastrels , expunges the wretched and deletes the worthless . We 're in big trouble . Who 's to say what 's worthless ? Oh , please ! Look in the mirror . Read your entry in " Who 's Nobody " . No , I mean it . Who 's to say what 's worthwhile ? Well , lying on your bunk reading " What Bike " and eating Sugar Puff sandwiches for eight hours every day is unlikely to qualify . So because I haven 't written any symphonies or painted the Sistine Chapel , I 'm prunable ? No , because you 're a totally worthless , unwashed space bum , you 're prunable . Precisely . The criterion is not fame , it is simply to have lived a worthwhile life . Why did no one mention this before ? If I 'd been told that the object was to lead a worthwhile life , I could have done something about it . All those charity telethons when I used to pledge donations , I would have given them MY credit card number . Sir , you don 't have to be a philanthropist , you simply have to seize the gift of life ... - Oh , God . - .. make a contribution ... - Oh , God . - .. no matter how small . You simply have to have lead a life that wasn 't totally egocentric and self-serving . You 're doing this on purpose . - I 'm just trying to make you feel better . - Shut up , then ! Hang on . Why should we take any notice of some half-crazed rogue robot who 's appointed himself judge and jury to humanity ? Why should we kowtow to his judgement ? Because I have the power to snap your body in two like a dry reed ! Good answer , man ! Good answer ! - So where is he ? - See me now and tremble ! The inquisition begins . Prove to me you are worthy of the honour of life or drink deeply from the well of nothingness for all eternity . I hate these " either / or " questions . Who is to be first ? Lister ! The hologram . You shall be first . ( SQUEAKS ) Pardon ? Sorry . You have been granted the greatest gift of all - the gift of life . Tell me , what you have done to deserve this superlative good fortune ? Well , I say this with the highest respect , but what gives you the right to ask - no , actually , demand - that answer of me , Your Magnificence ? All must answer to the Inquisitor ! How do I know I 'll get a fair hearing ? Because , like all who stand before the Inquisitor , your judge shall be ... ( CHEERILY ) .. yourself ! - Oh , smeg . - " Oh , smeg " indeed , matey . Everyone is judged by their own self ? It 's a bit metaphysical , I know , but it 's the only fair way . Now , then . Justify yourself . Well , first I ... - Liar . - I 've done good things . - No , you haven 't . - In my heart , I tried to do good things . - No , you didn 't . - Look , I 've tried to lead a good life . When ? Ah ! What 's that ? It 's the Archangel Gabriel ! Well , that 's me converted ! Hallelujah ! You are a slimy , despicable , rat-hearted , green discharge of a man , aren 't you ? Well ... sort of , yes . So , then , justify yourself . What else could I have been ? My father was a half-crazed military failure , my mother was a bitch-queen from hell . My brothers had looks and talent . What did I have ? Unmanageable hair and ingrowing toenails . Yes , I admit I 'm nothing . But from what I started with , nothing is up . Hi , buddy . This is your judgement day , bud . I gotta be cruel . No favours . I 'm hearing you on FM . I have to ask you the question - justify your existence . What contribution have you made ? I have given pleasure to the world because I have such a beautiful ass . - Well , that 's true . - Can I go now ? - That 's your case ? - You need more ? ! Some might say that 's a shallow argument . Some might say I 'm a shallow guy . But a shallow guy with a great ass . - Sometimes you astonish even me . - Thank you . Well , Kryten , justify yourself . I 'm not sure I can . Surely your life is replete with good works . Few individuals have lived a more selfless life . But I am programmed to live unselfishly . Any good work comes not out of fine motives , but as a result of binary commands I am compelled to obey . Well , then , how can any mechanical justify himself ? Only if he attempted to break his programming and conduct his life according to values arrived at independently . Your argument invites deletion . - The rules are yours . - Do you wish to be erased ? I am programmed not to wish for anything . I serve . In a human , this behaviour might be considered stubborn . But I am not human , and neither are you . And it is not our place to judge them . I wonder why you do ? ( BOOMING VOICE ) Enough . Well ... get out of this one , smeghead . - What you talkin ' about ? - You know what you could 've done , - what you could 've become . - So ? You 've got brains , man . Brains you 've never used . - So ? - So justify yourself . Spin on it ! The inquisition is over . I have reached my verdict . Two ofyou have failed to become that which you might so easily have been . You have lived without merit , and so not lived at all . ( WHOOSH ) - You scum ! You 've wiped them out ! - Sir ... He 's crazy , Kryten . He 's erased Cat and Rimmer . - They are quite safe . - Sir ... I 'm afraid we are to be erased . Ah . The Cat has lead a more worthwhile life than us ? He is a shallow and selfish creature , as is the hologram . By their own low standards , they have acquitted themselves . Whereas you and the mechanoid could have been so much more . ( WHOOSH ) - What 's this ? - We are being surgically removed from time . Every memory of us is being dissolved . Our lives are being undone . It is complete . The time-lines are knitted . Causality is healed . All that remains is to remove your physical forms from existence . Well , if you 've got some amazing plan up your sleeve , Kryten , now 's the time to mention it . No plan , sir . No sleeves . - ( WHOOSH ) - Perfect . Now , what did I do next ? ( BUZZING ) ( INQUISITOR WAILS ) Now , hurry ! Take the gauntlet and go ! - What is goin ' on ? - No time to explain . I 've come from the future to rescue you . Hurry ! What about me ... I mean you ... I mean us ? - I 'm afraid we get killed . - Killed ? How ? While I 'm standing here explaining this , the Inquisitor jumps me from behind . You can 't save me . Before you reach the storage bay , you must have decoded the gauntlet 's controls . - How ? Give us a clue ? - I cannot explain . For some bizarre reason , my final words are " enig " . - " Enig " ? - Yes . Enig ... - Come on , sir . - He 's just killed you ! Sir , we have to go ! - ( BLEEP ) - You are not registered as personnel . - State your name and clearance code . - It 's us , Hol ! - State your name and clearance code . - Lister , D , 000-169 . I have no record of your palm print . Intruder alert ! - Initiating override . - State your name and clearance code . Logon name , Kryten . Registration code , Additional 001 . I have no record of your CPU ident . - ( SIREN SOUNDS ) - We don 't exist any more . - ( YELLS ) - Tear gas ! ( WAILS ) Oh , thank God it 's you guys . - Move an eyebrow and you 're dog meat . - It 's us ! - Who are you ? What do you want ? - Rimmer , it 's me . - How do you know my name ? - It 's on your uniform . Sir , they 've never met us . We are between realities . - They have no memory of us . - I 'll ask once more . What do you want ? Yo , we 're not the enemy . There 's a guy here somewhere obliterating people from history . - We used to be your shipmates . - Only we 've forgotten you ( ! ) - Yeah . - Well , I 'm convinced ( ! ) - Rimmer , I know you . - Well , if you do , you 'll know I 'm the kind of hardened ex-marine type guy you do not trifle with . No , you 're not ! - For the last time ... - Fiona Barrington . Fifteen years old . You got off with her in your Dad 's greenhouse . You thought you got lucky but it turned out that you had your hand in warm compost . - How could I know that ? - Not true . You got three brothers . You 're really mean . You 're a tremendous physical coward . You spent an afternoon with the Samaritans and four people committed suicide . Your middle name 's Judas . You say it 's Jonathan . You sign all your official letters AJ Rimmer , BSc . BSc stands for Bronze Swimming Certificate . You 're a cheating , weaselly , lowlife scumbucket with all the charm and social grace of a pubic louse . Gotta admit , bud . He 's got a handle on you there . Sirs , you 've got to help us . The Inquisitor will obliterate us . Who the smeg are these guys , Rimmer ? Never mind that . Who the smeg are you ? I the smeg am Lister . Of course . An alternative you . A David Lister who never got a chance to exist . So we 're kind of ... sperms-in-law ? - Yes , sir . - Delicately put , sir . - So what do we do with them ? - Waste them . Rimmer , for smeg 's sake ! - He 's such a dork . - You 're tellin ' me ? They come here with some fairy story , chained together like Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis . Let 's open the door to oblivion for them . - Rimmer , no one 's killing no one . - Yeah , right . They 've come from some freaky alternative dimension to hijack this ship and do ... ooh , weird things to us . I think we should stick them in the brig . I hate to say it , but TransAm wheel arch nostrils is right . - Get moving . - What did you call me ? - Look , you know the score . - Why do I know the score ? Because you 're me . We 're shot from the same gun barrel . Only difference is , one did breast stroke , one did crawl . What are you trying to say ? - I 'm saying ... - ( CRASH ) That 's him , guys ! This way ! - Come on ! Let 's go ! - Let 's go back ! Oh , my God ! Hang on a minute . I can use this . Come on ! Go ! If we got down to the transport decks , we could nick one of the Starbugs . Uh-oh . A door . Let 's use an air vent . - No need . - Sir ? Look , I 'm gonna do something that 's totally gross . Turn around . - What ? - Trust me , you don 't wanna know . ( BLEEPS AND HUMS ) Logically , sir , there is only one way you could have opened that door . I feel quite nauseous . - Where is it ? - Where 's what ? Oh , sir , you 've got it in your jacket ! - I got us out of the hold , didn 't I ? - Sir , you are a sick , sick person . - How can you conceive of such an idea ? - Shut up or I 'll beat you with the wet end ! Sir , if mechanoids could barf , I 'd be onto my fifth bag by now . - You 're a sick person ! - Come on ! What 's the point in trying to get out of this ? We already know we fail . Not so . We only know that I die . If my gambit results in your safety , it will be a move well made . For myself , death holds no fear . - Oh , yeah ? - Sir , I am programmed to relinquish my life . That 's why the 4000 Series was voted " Android of the Year " five years running . I have as much interest in saving my own life as a chronically depressed lemming . That 's not true , is it ? Not any more . And it 's all because of me . It 's my fault . I made you break your programming . I taught you to lie , to make your own decisions . I made you more ... more human . I gave you a life to lose . Sir , with the greatest respect , that is complete shash . Kryten , I know when you 're lying . Your right foot jiggles . - It 's involuntary . - Nonsense . I 'm not afraid to die . For me , death holds no fear . I believe in Silicon Heaven . I believe in an afterlife for androids ! - Haven 't you broken those damn manacles ? ! - Kryten ! - I won 't let it happen . - Cause and effect , sir . It HAS happened . There 's nothing we can do except save your life . I think this is a variant of the Enigma decoding system . - Enigma . " Enig " - Enigma . - " Enig " . Of course . My last words . Anyway , if this works , it should age those manacles by half a million years . - If it doesn 't work ? - It 'll wipe out the universe . - Phew ! - What now ? Well , now WE have the power . ( CLUNK ) OK , we don 't know you , but we know we wanna be on your side . He killed our crew mates . He 's a monster . - I 'm the Cat , this is Rimmer . - Yeah . Lister . Kryten . Look , I 'm not in love with the idea of pitching in with you , but needs must . You really don 't remember me , do you ? How I used to get on your pecks . Like I 'd be trimming me toenails with your electric meat carver , and you 'd go spare . Sir , we must get down to the storage bay . Remember my message . That is where we meet the Inquisitor for the final confrontation . That 's your plan ? Go and face him ? Nice plan ( ! ) Shall I paint a bull 's-eye on my face ? Listen , Kryten . I 've come up with something . - Yes , sir ? - I 'm gonna use my brains for once . Considering the circumstances , sir , do you really believe that 's wise ? - Give me the gauntlet . - You don 't understand it . - You 'll have to shout instructions . - Why don 't I wear it ? - You can 't , Kryten . - Why not ? You 're programmed not to kill . So , the mortals seek to challenge my mastery . ( SWOOSH ) Kryten , I can 't work this thing . Gamma , delta , one , four , five . - Smeg . You youthed me . - The sport begins . ( SWOOSH ) Now what the smeg have you done ? Excuse me . Could I distract you for a second ? Huh ? ( SWOOSH ) " Excuse me . Could I distract you for a second " ? ! It was the best I could ad-lib at the time , sir . - He got the Cat and Rimmer , though . - I know . Look , I 've got to go back in time and sacrifice myself in order that we can get into this mess in the first place . Yeah , sure . All in all , today 's been a bit of a bummer , sir . - How long before he unfreezes ? Ten minutes ? - No. 8.4 . - We 'd better be right , Kryten . - I know . Gauntlets . Now , what do I say when I pop up behind the Inquisitor ? - Er , " Perfect . Now what do I ... " - That 's it . I 've got it . I 've got it . OK , big fella . It 's dangling time . - Welcome back on-line . - What are you doing ? One way or the other , you killed a lot of my friends this afternoon . In fact , you may never get on my good side again . - Oops . - So now you 're going to kill me ? I don 't think so . You 're a fat little human who doesn 't have the balls . Dumb talk for a guy who 's dangling over a chasm . I 've seen inside your heart . You don 't have it in you . Oh , yeah ? Bet your life ? - I never intended to kill you . - Oh , no ? No . I intended to save your life . Save my life ? Why ? 'Cause if I save your life , and you erase me , I won 't be there to save your life , and you 'll die . Chew on that , pal . You 're giving me my gauntlet back ? I 'm all right . You can 't touch me . You might 've killed the others , but I 'm OK . Oh , just one thing . If I erase you from history , you will never have existed to kill me in the first place . - That 's a point . - So , in fact , I can erase you quite safely . Yeah . Yeah ! It 's the old backfiring time gauntlet trick . You just bought yourself a one-way ticket to oblivion . But you can 't ! All my glorious work will be undone ! ( WHOOSH ) - Oh , it worked ! - It worked ? - You 're a genius . - It was your scheme , sir . - I simply re-programmed the gauntlet . - So what now ? ( WHOOSH ) Well , we wait for the time-space continuum to reorder itself . ( WHOOSH ) I believe this is an appropriate juncture to give me five , sir . Give you five ? I can do better than that . I can give you fifteen . # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

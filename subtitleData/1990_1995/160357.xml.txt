 [ woman crying ] Lauren , I 've been looking ev ... Areyou all right ? Doyou want some water ? No. I 'm fine . Oh , honey , it 's been a couple ofweeks now . Doyou want to talk ? No . Really , Jane , I 'm okay . I just haven 't known a lot ofpeople who have died , you know . I 've never known anybody that killed themselves . Maybe once everything gets packed away it will get easier . There won 't be the constant reminder . Here 's your paycheck . Come on . Go home . Okay . [ electronicbeeping ] [ screaming ] Oh , please ! Oh , please ! I have no money ! [ screaming ] Please , I have no money ! Let me go ! [ screaming ] Food . [ coughs ] I think I 'll pass . Hey , I know a good place to crash . Up the fire escape Through that window . Come on . I 'll giveyou a boost . Pull it down . I can 't get it down . Come on , pull . Come on ! Come on ! Agent Scully , Agent Mulder Chief Blevins assures us ofyour cooperation . We regret any inconvenience at this extreme hour . We hopeyour expertise in extraordinary phenomenon will help us answer some questions . You 're not F.B.l. , areyou ? Haveyou ever analyzed anything like this before ? Abnormal postmortem muscle refex . Both corpses are still responding to exposure to high levels ofelectrostatic charge . Any external lesions or surface burns ? None . Time ofdeath ? Well , it can 't be long . The body 's still warm . Somatic death occurred sometime over six hours ago but their body temperatures haveyet to drop below 98.3 . Where did you find them ? Look , at least tell us the time and mode oftransport . That might help us determine why the bodies haven 't cooled . You guys called us down here . You want some answers you got to give some . They traveled 60 minutes by air . Thankyou . The most troubling aspect ofthe deaths is the throat area . Larynx , esophagus , and hyoid bone- - all have been crushed like chalk . No abrasions , or evidence oftissue damage . It 's as iftheir throats were crushed from the inside . Who are these guys ? Scully : Ifyou 've done your examinations why areyou consulting us ? Working on the X-Files haveyou seen anything like this ? No , never . Well , thankyou very much foryour time Agent Mulder , Scully . Ifany inquiry as to this meeting be made we request full denial . I 'd sayyou people already suffer from full denial . You lied . You have seen it before . I can tell . You lied to them . I would never lie . I willfully participated in a campaign ofmisinformation . Who doyou think theywere ? N.S.A. , C.l.A. , some covert organization that Congress will uncover in the next scandal . It 's not important who they are but what they have . I 'm sure they have no idea , because they called us in . I have X-Files- - each case has an element ofwhat we saw tonight . Residual electrostatic charge , internal mutilation- - none has the elements combined in one case . How can an esophagus be crushed without the neck being touched ? Psychokinetic manipulation . Psychokinesis ? You mean how Carrie got even at the prom ? The Russians were doing studies on it . The Chinese still are . Their findings are kept secret . Okay , I 'm intrigued but how can we investigate ? We have nothing to go on . just getting in , Lauren ? Oh ! Mr. Graves used to letyou get awaywith that but Mr. Dorlund is in charge now . I was wondering ifl could have a minute with him ? Tomorrow ... at 3 : 00 . [ sighs ] Oh ! Oh ! is everything all right out here ? Can I speakwith you ? Please . Um , I 'm here to give my two-week notice . Uh-huh ... Lauren , Jane told me aboutyou crying in Howard 's office and I wantyou to know you 're not alone . As a matter offact , we share something special . Howard and I started this company ten years ago . As long as I knew him he had no interest in anything besides work . So , some ofus became family . I was his brother . You were like a daughter . So , ofcourse I feel very close toyou and I ... I want to take care ofmy family . Stay , Lauren , please . The company needs you . Especially now . I won 't letyou leave , Lauren . What 's wrong ? [ gaspingandgrunting ] I , uh ... I can 't . I have to leave . I can 't be here anymore . You 've got two weeks . Mohammed Amrahlabi . " Convictions : Illegal possession offirearms illegal possession ofexplosives falsification ofexport licenses . " He has ties to an extremist group in the U.S.- - the Isfahan named after the city in Iran . They 're working out of Philadelphia . That 's 60 air minutes . I 'll talk to the Philly P.D. Officer : This is where we found him . Who discovered their bodies ? Nobody . It was about 1 0 : 00 ; I was on patrol . just saw them hanging around . No witnesses ? The kind ofpeople who come around here after business hours don 't witness very much . You know what I 'm saying . We 'll just question everyone on record who was at the machine before 1 0 : 00 that night . There . I 'll back up . Lauren Kyte . 858 Franklin , Bensalem . Whywould the Isfahan be robbing someone of40 bucks at an ATM machine ? Look at that . Maybe it 's another person . Maybe . Maybe not . Well , the resolution 's too poor . It won 't help much to enhance it . That leaves us only one person we know we can talk to . Oh , come on . [ knockingatdoor ] [ knocking ] Hello ? Ms. Lauren Kyte , please . I 'm agent Fox Mulder . This is Agent Dana Scully . We 're with the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation . Maywe come in ? I was in the middle ... We won 't be long . Thankyou . Haveyou ever seen either ofthese two men before ? No . Takeyour time . I 'm sorry . I 've never seen them before . I 'm afraid you have . Can you tell us what happened that night ? Um ... These guys , I ... I was depositing my paycheck . They grabbed me , I got away , I ran . I just didn 't want to file a report . Theywere found dead . Haveyou ever seen this person before ? No . I 'm sorry. I can 't tell you . Does that mean you know ? Uh ... It means I ... I can 't tell you who it is . Well , when you can tell me this is the number I can be reached at any time , okay ? Mm-hmm . A woman her size breaking free and outrunning those men ? Then somehow crushing their necks ? Scully : She knows who the other person in the photo is . She 's packing , running away , but from what ? [ tiressquealing ] What 's happening ? What the hell 's going on ? Mulder : Hang on ! Areyou okay ? Yeah . Hi . Hi . The paramedics checkyou out ? Yeah. I 'm fine , although I do have a standing-in-line - at-the-DMV-sized headache . Mine 's more l.R.S.-sized. Did they check out the car ? It 's brand-new . only 1 00 miles . Then someone tampered with it while we were in her house . The mechanic says everything 's in proper order . Nothing cut , nothing greased . Check out the lights . They 're on . No . The filaments are heated due to massive levels ofelectrostatic charge just like the bodies in the morgue . And isn 't it interesting that Lauren Kyte was present at both incidents ? She was in our presence the entire time . What ifit 's possible to raise the body 's electrostatic charge to the levels we 've been seeing and use that energy to affect objects ? lfa person generated that much energy their body would break down . They 'd glow like those lights . There 's evidence ofthis in the X-Files- - furniture moving untouched objects levitating unexplained electrical discharges . Frequently , people who have psychokinetic power are unaware oftheir own capability . Areyou saying Lauren Kyte crashed our car ? Either that ... or a poltergeist . They 're here . They may be . Mulder , look at the tangible evidence . Two mideast extremists were killed trying to assault a woman working for a manufacturer ofparts for the Defense Department . When we questioned her , our carwas sabotaged . In both cases , someone else may have committed those acts- - Maybe the same someone from the ATM photos . The mystery isn 't psychokinetic energy . It 's her accomplice . Excuse me . She 's clean . No arrest , not even a traffic ticket . The only thing is she 's in deep with her credit card company- - 1 5,000 . What doyou think you 're doing ? Man : I 'm going to put that on here . No , no. I 'll take care ofthis , all right ? Here. I 'll talk to somebody . Mulder : A little upset over losing a parking space wouldn 'tyou say ? Who is Howard Graves , anyway ? She was his secretary . That 's three people dead in the last month associated with Lauren Kyte . You won 't find too many people at their boss ' grave who aren 't dancing on it . Look at this one . [ watersplashing ] Excuse me , sir ? is there an office where l can get some information on those people ? Who ? I attend every funeral . I 'm the last person to see them put to rest . Doyou know how Sarah Lynn was related to Howard Graves ? His daughter . Theywere at home one day and he didn 't latch the pool gate . She drowned . His wife left him a year later . She 's buried in a plot in the northeast corner . Thankyou , sir . You 're welcome . She was only threeyears old . Ifshe had lived , she 'd be Lauren 's age . Furtherinvestigation into Lauren Kyte 's personalhistory ... revealsan estrangement from herfamily . Phonerecords confiirm no contact withherparents forthelast twoyears . Heractions , observedduringsurveillance , indicateastrong relationship between Lauren Kyte ... andheremployer , thelate Howard Graves . Was this relationship somehowthemotivation forhissuicide ? Howare theattack andsubsequentmurders ofthe Isfahanagents related , ifatall ? Iam certain theanswers to these questions ... lie in fiinding theidentity ofLauren Kyte 'saccomplice . Enhance it by ten . That 's Howard Graves . He 's alive . Not necessarily . [ hissing ] [ stairs creaking ] [ muffledvoice ] Man : Don 'tdo this tome . Howard . Howard : No . Stop . No , no ! Please , no ! [ moaning ] [ sobbing ] [ panickedgasping ] Lauren : Howard . Theykilledhim . I think Howard Graves fabricated his own death . Doyou know how difficult it is to fakeyour own death ? Only one man has pulled it off- - Elvis . He and Lauren Kyte are in on something . Maybe an illegal dealing through his company- - something the C.l.A. was interested in . You may be right . Wait . You think I 'm right ? Sure . All you got to do is prove Howard Graves is still alive . Howard Graves is very dead . Maywe see the autopsy report , please ? Knockyourselfout . Uh ... " Cause ofdeath , arterial hemorrhage ... " Bledsoe : Four out ofsix liters ofblood down the tub . Well , there seems to be some blood work missing here . We only do that ifwe suspect homicide . I don 't supposeyou ran any dental confirmations ? What for ? It was him . How did you know ? It said so on the toe tag . Who made positive l.D. on the body ? Um ... Lauren Kyte . Mulder : But he was cremated . There 's no way to run a dental check or get a DNA sample . Yes , there is . His body 's tissues and organs were donated . Man : Howard Graves is in five different people . They harvested the organs immediately after death . His kidneys were sent to Boston his liver to Dallas and his corneas to Portland , Oregon . They 've all been transplanted . Because ofhis age we could only cryopreserve the dura matter in the membrane ofthe spinal column . We have Mr. Graves' hospital records . We 'll extract a sample , run a test and in a couple ofhours confirm the identity ofthe donor . I , uh , made them rush soyou could haveyour check beforeyou leave . Oh. I 'm going to miss you . Oh . Oh , what ? Here . Good-bye . [ doorcloses ] You were going to leave without saying good-bye ? Well , uh , I came to say good-bye and to wish you luck ... and to leaveyou with this little thought . I know Howard told you and ifit ever gets out I won 't waste my time trying to pin the source . I 'll go straight toyou . And you 'll do to me whatyou did to Howard ? I knowyou had him killed . Whywould you say that ? He told me . [ telephoneringing ] Mulder . How soon can you be at my house ? Why ? Please hurry . The tests are conclusive . The dura matter does belong to Howard Graves . He is , indeed , very dead . [ knocking ] just a second . [ screaming ] Go run the bath . Get out ofhere ! No ! No ! [ screaming ] No . No ! [ choking ] No ! [ Laurenscreaming : ] No ! No ! [ mangasping ] [ Lauren crying ] You know , you 're not under arrest . You 'rejust here for questioning . The sooner you talk to us the sooner you get to go home . What happened to those people tonight ? Doyou have any idea who they might be ? Why did they attackyou ? Doyou know who this is ? Scully , Mulder . He 'll keep an eye on her . Come on . Now . You 've seriously compromised our investigation . We were following leads pertaining to an X-File . I want to know every detail ofyour activities concerning this case . You 're the ones who have been withholding information . Why don 'tyou tell us whatyou 've got ? Then we have nothing more to talk about . Wait ! We believe H.T.G. Industrial Technologies sold restricted parts to the Isfahan . Serial numbers were recovered in the wreckage ofthe bombing ofa navy transport van . How is Lauren Kyte involved ? Your actions impeded our investigation . We don 't have enough evidence to hold her . Ifshe doesn 't talk , she goes free and we lose our chance to break this company . I could make her talk . My advice toyou : don 't get rough with her . That was a waste oftime . Your turn . Lauren ... I won 't talk toyou either . Okay . Then you 're free to go . I can 't go back to that house . Why ? Because of Howard Graves ? He 's dead . I know . He 's watching overyou , isn 't he ? Lauren : I don 't know ifyou 've ever been a secretary before . Sometimes your boss can talk as ifyou weren 't even in the room which can hurt , you know . Sometimes you 're all he has to talk to which is how it always was with me and Howard . One night , late , I went into his office . He was crying , more scared than sad . The Pentagon contracts were being canceled . The companywas going under . He felt personally responsible for each ofhis employees . Seeing and feeling their fear every day reallywore him down . Then this one time , Dorlund came with that group- - that mideast group- - Isfahan . They 'd buy parts at an outrageous price- - notjust once- - for as long as they could get awaywith it . That night Howard was crying , he hadjust found out that Isfahan had claimed responsibility for killing a couple sailors in Florida . He was never the same and I thought that 's why he killed himself ... but he didn 't . I saw ... Howard showed me how Dorlund had him killed . Made it look like a suicide , 'cause he could see Howard was going to put an end to the deal . So now Howard is protecting you ? It sounds so ridiculous . Butyou believe it ? He was closer to me than my father . I told him that . I still feel his presence . Sometimes ... I even smell his after-shave . lfyoujust could have ... seen the things I 've seen . I just want all that to go away . That 's why I 'm leaving . Maybe he can move on . That 's not enough . You have been given the chance to tell him again . Take it . Tell him you love him by showing him ... by ... by helping us finish his unfinished business . Lauren , how will you ever be able to rest ifhe never can ? Okay . I 'm a mess . I 'm going to , uh ... wash up . What areyou doing , Scully ? You don 't believe . Mulder , there 's no such things as ghosts or psychokinesis . I 'm sure there 's an explanation , but I believe that she believes and my priority is to get her to help us stop Dorlund . Well , we may havejust sacrificed our best opportunity to observe spectral phenomena . No , I 'm giving us the chance to solve a case that 's tangible instead ofchasing after shadows . [ dooropensandshuts ] Areyou ready ? All right , everyone we have a warrant to search the premises for evidence pertaining to the sale ofrestricted manufactured parts . The evidence may be in the form offalsified export licenses , parts manifests , communiques . It could be on computer disk or hard copy . Once there , ifin doubt , ask . We need this to be clean . This is the culmination ofa yearlong investigation . Ifwe don 't come out ofthere todaywith something proving a connection to the Isfahan this guy could walk . Okay , let 's go . You okay ? It will most likely be in Dorlund 's office . We 'll execute the search , but we 'll need you to guide us soyou have to be strong , okay ? Scully : Everybody stay calm . Federal Bureau oflnvestigation . Ma 'am , could you back away from those files , please ? This is all we could find . We don 't have him . He 's not even breaking a sweat . Webster : Our case is blown . We 've wasted a year . This guy 's going to walk . Let 's get out ofhere . Mulder : Lauren , it 's over . we have to go . What we 're looking for isn 't here . Dorlund : She 's no agent . I 've been more than cooperative . She has no right to destroy my personal property . What about that van that blew up and killed those servicemen ? I don 't know whatyou 're talking about you stupid bitch ! Lauren , no ! Lauren : Don 't kill him ! Help us find it ! [ lights explode ] Mulder ! Oh , my god . Mulder : I guess what we 're looking for is here . The U.S. Attorney 's Office is going after Dorlund with everything they 've got including the murder of Howard Graves . I 'll come back to testify . Whereyou going ? Away from here . [ enginestarting ] Thanks . Boy , she 's in a rush to get out ofhere . Out ofhere , or away from the ghost of Howard Graves ? Hey , Scully , doyou believe in an afterlife ? I 'd settle for a life in this one . You ever seen the Liberty Bell ? Yes . I 've been to Philadelphia 1 00 times and I 've never seen it . You 're not missing much . It 's a big bell with a big crack and you have to wait in a long line . I 'dreallylike togo . Whynow ? Idon 'tknow . Howlate doyou think theystay open ? Miss Kyte , I asked for this 25 minutes ago . I know. I 'm sorry . Maybe that 's the way theywork back East but here in the Midwest , punctuality is a virtue . We really have to find a new office space . Every time a truck goes by the whole building shakes . That 's all , Lauren .

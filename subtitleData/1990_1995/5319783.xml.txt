Tree . A Tree . A Tree . [ Father ] Jason ! [ Mother ] Jason ! Jason ! Jason ! [ Father And Mother ] Jason ! [ Car Engine Roaring ] [ Sonic Booms ] What Can You Tell Me About That ? Anything In Particular ? A Tree . A Tree . I Used To Play On One When I Was A Kid . Mm-Hmm . Yeah , It Was Huge . It Had A Swing On It . Basically , It Was An Old Rope With A Big Tractor Tire . Mm-Hmm . [ Mother ] Jason ! Please Be Careful On That Swing ! [ Thud ] I ... I Had This Thing About Touching The Sky . My Mother ... My Mother Would Get Hysterical Because I Would Swing Back And Forth Like A Wild Monkey , Trying To Get Higher And Higher . And ? And I , Uh ... I Had This Little Accident . Uh , I Must Have Been 9 Or 10 . You Fell Off ? Huh . I Smashed Into The Tree Head-On , Scared The Crap Out Of My Parents . So Why Do You Think You Wanted To Touch The Sky ? I Guess I Always Had This Fascination With Height And Speed . Speed ? Yeah . Wanting To Control It . I Always Wanted To Touch The Outer Limits . At 9 ? Well ... I Don 't Know . I Guess I Just Wanted To Be Free And Get Away . From What ? I 'm Not Quite Sure . What Do You Think ? I Don 't Know . All Right . Ahem . All Right . Cross Section Of A Brain . Correct ? What 's Wrong With Him ? [ Siren ] I 've Got Some Good News . Jason 's Going To Be Fine . [ Mother ] Oh , Thank God . Skull X-Rays Show No Fractures . It Doesn 't Look Like There 's A Subdural Hematoma . [ Father ] No Brain Damage ? He Was Twitching Something Awful , You Know . He Was Shaking Pretty Terribly . He May Have Experienced A Seizure . That Would Explain The Convulsions . I Don 't Think There 's Anything To Worry About . I 'm Doing Some EEGs To Be On The Safe Side . I 'm Also Bringing In Dr. Brookman . He 's Our Neurologist . Why Do We Need Another Doctor ? Well , There 's A Very Remote , And I Mean Remote , Possibility That Jason Could Experience Recurring Seizures Down The Line . It Reminded You Of A Brain ? Shit . They 're Back . Right ? Did , Uh ... Did I , Uh , Mention What Happened To Me After The Accident ? With The Tree ? Uh , I Had A- - Some Kind Of Head Injury . A Head Injury ? Yeah . Well , Not Really . I Had Some Sort Of , Uh ... Seizures ? Well , I 'm Not Sure . Maybe Something Like Them . When--When Was This ? Oh , Uh , For A Few Years As A Kid . Well , Can You Remember Anything About Them ? I Didn 't Tell Anyone . Why Not ? I Had Some Pretty Strange Experiences . I , Uh , I Thought They 'd Think I Was Out Of My Mind . Hmm . I See . So Your Parents Didn 't Know ? No , Nobody Knew . I Didn 't Even Know . I 'd Had These Weird Flashes Out Of Nowhere All Jumbled Together . Weird Stuff . They 'd Come And Go Just Like That . Any Smells ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh ... Strange Things . Burnt Rubber , Uh , Skunk ... Glue . Glue . Yep . Sounds Like Seizures To Me . Yes . The Brain Is Fascinating . Did You Know That It 's Made Of Tissue That Can Develop An Electrical Charge ? Yeah , You See , Hitting Your Head Like You Did , You Probably Ended Up With Some Pretty Serious Postconcussive Trauma . You Might Have Had A Brain Cell In The Wrong Place Or Enervated In Some Weird Way . Maybe A ... Maybe The Wrong Type Of Signals Or Too Many Signals . Sort Of A Cerebral Short Circuit . Well , They Weren 't That Bad . Ha Ha ! " Primary And Secondary Seizures . " All Right . " Primary Seizures Seem To Be The Result Of Some ... " Uh ... All Right , Biochemical Or Genetic Screw-Up , " While Secondary Seizures " Result From Some Pathologic Condition Or Disease . " It Sounds Like You May Have Had Some Intracranial Damage To The Old Cabeza . You May Have Had A Seizure Right After The Accident Or Several Months Or Years Later . They Were--They Were Nothing , Really . What Do You Consider Nothing ? Well , We 're Not Talking About Your Normal , Garden Variety , Falling-On-The-Floor , Writhing-Around Seizures Here . You Mean They Weren 't Grand Mal Seizures . I Don 't Know What The Technical Term Is . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Ahem . Like That . Anything Close ? Have You Ever Seen That Kind Of Attack ? Oh , My God . No . No . No , It Was More Of A- - More Of An Internal Kind Of Thing . Uh , You Know , Uh ... Like A ... Well , You Wouldn 't Even Know I Was Having Them . Petit Mal Seizures . Petit Mal ? Yes , Yes . See , You Still Would Have Lost Awareness , Maybe 5 Or 10 Seconds , But All You 'd Have Is A Blank Stare . Maybe Some Mild Eye Twitching . Perhaps Lip Smacking . And Loss Of Motor Activity . This Guy 's A Nut Case . Neat . That 's , Uh , That 's Fascinating . Yes , Yes . But You Specifically Said Something About Weird Flashes , Hallucinations , Strange Smells And Sounds . Now , The Only Seizures That Have Those Symptoms Are Simple Or Complex Partial Seizures . So Which Is It ? Which Is What ? Of The Two Choices . Choices ? The Kind Of Seizures . Oh . Complex Partial Seizures Couldn 't Be Simple Partial Seizures Because You Would Have Been Jerking Uncontrollably , Grimacing , Sweating , That Sort Of Thing . You Didn 't Have That , Did You ? No . No , I Don 't Think So . No , I Didn 't Think So , Either . All Right . Ahh . Where Were We ? O.K. , Here We Have A Geometric Shape . Uh ... A Blade , Propeller ? Something Burning ? Hmm ? [ Sniffs ] Hey , Jase . [ Engine Roars ] I Hear Your Not-So-Secret Plastic Planes Make Great Lightning Rods . [ Engine Roars ] Lightning Rods . Crash . Excuse Me ? I Thought You ... I Thought You Said Propeller . Huh ? Oh . Uh ... Right , Right . You Just Said Crash . Right . And Something About Burning . Oil . I Smelled Burning Engine Oil . Like , Uh , Like That Race Car Smell . He Knows . He Knows I 'm Having Them . Maybe This Time I 've Got Brain Damage . Try To Think What First Came To Mind When You Thought You Saw A Propeller . Flying , I Think . So You Saw A Plane ? I Guess . What About The Crash ? I Don 't , Uh ... That 's All Right . That 's Fine , That 's Fine . Um , Let 's--Let 's Go Back To This Flying Thing , All Right ? You Think This May Have Anything To Do With Your Wanting To Touch The Sky ? You Still Have This Feeling ? Uh , I Guess . Um , Uh , I Think It Was More Pronounced After The Accident . How 's That ? I Don 't Know . I Suppose I Had A Greater Sense Of Control , Uh , Freedom , Uh ... Being Stronger . Stronger Than Anyone Who Didn 't Have Seizures ? No , No . I Wanted To Fly Way Before I Had Any Seizures . Oh , Did You ? I See . Well , Did You Ever Actually Fly ? Oh , God , Yes , Even Before I Had A Driver 's License . As A Matter Of Fact , When I Stopped Having Seizures . I Did Stop Having Them . When Was That ? Uh , Well , I 'm Not Exactly Sure . I Must Have Been , Uh , 15 , 16 Years Old . Uh , They Were Less And Less Frequent , And Eventually , I Never Even Thought Of Them . Mm-Hmm . Go On . Well ... Then I Really Went Crazy . Bad Choice . Well , Not Crazy ... Uh , Nuts . I Mean , Just Crazy . Yeah , You Know , Wild , Uh , Like Teenage Kind Of Stuff . Oh . Go On . Well , I Did Everything- - Anything That Had To Do With Going Faster , Higher , Further , Anything That Had To Do With Compressing Time , Anything That Was A Little Dangerous Or Was , Uh , Uh ... Death Defying . Oh , Well , I Don 't Know About Death Defying . Well , What Did You Mean By--By Compressing Time ? Well , I ... You Know , I Had This Thing About , Uh , Dying Young , And I Really Don 't Know Why , But I Guess I Just Wanted To Live More . I--I Wanted To ... To Squeeze More Life Into The Time That I Had . And I Think That I Was Scared Shitless That I Wouldn 't Have A Chance To Do Everything That I Had To Do Or Wanted To Do . So How Do You Feel About Death Now ? I Mean ... Are You Still Afraid Of Dying ? I Haven 't Given It Much Thought Recently . Mm-Hmm . Do You Think About It Ever ? Well , I Try To Avoid That Line Of Thought . Why ? Uh , Well , I ... I--I Mean , I 'm Not Ready Now . Maybe When I 'm Older . Trust Me . No One 's Ever Ready . But You Were Saying , " Teenage ... " Oh , Yeah . I--I Really Got Into Typical Teenage Stuff--Cars ...

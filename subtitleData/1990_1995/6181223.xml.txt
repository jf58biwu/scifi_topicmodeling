No problem . - The network does not revolve around you ! Are you saying I 'm not the center of the universe ? - Don 't get wise ! I always get you the story . You think because you broke a few stories that you 're indispensable ? Well , I had a chat with the network today and you know what ? - No , what ? You 're fired . They 're in the drain-out tunnels .

How many UniSols were injured ? - Just who are these guys ? I will address you accordingly . This marks the third successful mission for the Universal Soldiers . Again , without any casualties and without any injuries . As to the UniSols ' identity , that remains classified . But Colonel ... - These men have families . I won 't jeopardize that . Now I have other matters to attend to . Lieutenant , could I have a statement ? - There 'll be a briefing tonight . What are we doing here ? We need pictures . Lieutenant , please , one statement ! Huey , I have an idea . No , you don 't . Yeah , I do . - I hate when you do this . Ronnie , what are you doing ? This is too close ! They 're gonna see us .

At 30 below , lowering to final stage of 60 , sub-zero . He just froze up . We can 't figure it out . - What do you mean ? At the end of the mission he became completely unresponsive . Did he overheat ? - He hardly broke a sweat . GR-44 , why did you not respond ? What happened ? Innocent ... What do you mean ? The village was cleared . That girl was innocent , Sarge . Sarge ? Who is Sarge ? That could be an old memory . We should take him out of the program until we find out what 's going on in his head . GR-44 stays with the program . But , Colonel ... - He just got mixed up . Just give him the serum . Okay , guys , memory clearance . Take your positions . Activate injection . They 're moving something else onto the tarmac !

He shot a man ! - I need every soldier I 've got . We 're goin ' after them . Colonel Perry ! We killed an innocent man . Should we let that reporter run off with one of our UniSols ? We can 't just cover this up . We have a moral obligation to tell the truth . I thought you were more clever than that . This whole project is off the shelf . Do you think those wimps at the Pentagon would allow the regeneration of dead soldiers ? I don 't think I can be a part of this anymore . If this is uncovered now , we 're all going to jail . Understood ? Why did you do that ? Why did you help me out ? My tour 's up . Just want to go home . But I can 't until you 're safe . - What do you mean ? My God ! You 've been shot !

Estimated time of interception ? - 4 minutes . - 4 minutes and marking . How you doin ' ? You must be pretty tired after all that pushing and stuff . Well , I 'm gonna go . I 'll be right back . Where are you going ? - To make a phone call . You mind ? Change ... I need some gas . We ran out of gas yesterday . Refueling truck comes in the morning . You want to rent a room ? Nice outfit . Shit ! Hey , you don 't look so good . I need to cool down . All our rooms have air conditioning . I some with water beds . Hey , the pay phone 's out . All our rooms have telephones , too . Only 50 dollars a night . I need a phone . What about this one ? Sorry , that 's for employees only . Since there 's two of you , that 's double occupancy . Extra 10 dollars . And a matter of a small 20 dollar security deposit . Of course , 20 dollars . Have a nice stay . Great . Maybe there 's already something on the news . Commence UniSol deployment . B and C teams , take supporting positions . GR-13 , seek and destroy local communications lines in target areas . ... one prays for the speedy handling of terrorist situations . In a related story , only hours after the rescue at McKinley Dam , news reporters become news makers . Reporting live , Chris Garvey . In a surprising development , a CNA cameraman , Huey Taylor , was shot and killed in a motel room in Eagle Rock City . Witnesses allege that CNA correspondent Veronica Roberts shot him after an apparent argument . Cocaine was found at the scene . No way . No way ! I don 't believe this ! They won 't get away with this ! You must return to your room . Mother , come here . There must be a phone that works in this place . This area 's not secure . - You know , why don 't you ... What are you doing ? It 's not safe for you out there . - Where are your clothes ? I have to ... I have to cool down . My God , you 're burning up ! I need ... ice . Shame on ya GR-13 , continue advance . Target center structure . What is she doing with all that ice ? Maybe I should call the police . I 've heard of cold showers before , but this is ridiculous . How you doin ' ? I got all the ice that I could . You okay ? How 's your ... Your wound ? It 's , it 's healing ! Well , I 'm gonna make that phone call , and call a doctor ... or something . Heat and infrared , check . Munitions and firearms identifier , powered and working . Don 't even start with me , alright ? And take this lock off . Goddamn it ! Hey , lady ! What are you doing with the phone ? You know how much those things cost ? You got a lot of nerve ! - Shut up ! This one doesn 't work either . - Huh ? You women just don 't know how to use phones . You killed it ! This is comin ' out of your deposit ! He 's got her in sight . GR-13 has a lock on the girl . What do you want me to do ? Tell him to wait till they 're together . - GR-13 , hold fire . And now , back to " Nixon and the War Years , Part 7 . " We will keep America the strongest nation in the world . And we will couple that strength with firm diplomacy . No apologies . There was no question about that , because when I resigned , later President Ford issued a pardon . When I accepted the pardon , in that I made it very clear ... I want that place surrounded . - GR-86 and 61 , take positions at the rear of the motel . How are you feeling ? The war is over . Maybe not . All focus to visual . Powering alternate scanning devices . Motion detectors locked in . Something weird is going on here . None of the phones here work . I mean , there hasn 't been a storm . They 're in the 2nd room now . You better duck and cover ! Follow me . He 's in the 3rd room now . The last wall is solid concrete . He 's not going anywhere . I think we got him trapped . Go on , knock it down ! What ? Get down ! Soldiers , move in . Where is he ? I think we lost him . - That 's impossible . Garth , get back to your station and get me some tracking , dammit ! You have a car ? - Yeah . Give me the keys . - Hurry up . Don 't worry . - Hurry . Got ' em ? - Thank you . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Really , I had nothing to do with this . They 're leaving the motel . - Damn it ! Come on , Woodward , I need you out here . Way to go , Garth . 20 dollar security deposit , huh ? Woodward . He 's trying to cool himself . Are you sure they 're not following us ? - No . You 're such a comfort . - Buckle up . I 'm fine . - It 's for your safety . How can you be so damn calm ? Your buddies just shot enough ammo at us to destroy Europe , and you 're worried about my seat belt ? Alright , alright ... All buckled up . Alright , Mr. Top Secret , I want some answers , okay ? First , you push a car faster than my mother drives , then you use ice like other people use Band-Aids , and then you just run through walls . I 'm sorry , but this is not normal behavior . Now , just who the hell are you ? Where are you from anyway ? Are you from France or Canada or ... ? I figure you must be French because of your accent . What accent ? Look , you got a family ? You got friends ? Is there a Mrs. 44 waiting for you someplace ? Are you avoiding my questions or don 't you know ? What the hell did they do to you ? I don 't know . But I 'm going to find out . Hey , no smoking around the pumps ! - I 'm sorry . - Come on . Would you quit pulling on my arm ? Park the car . Let 's go . Park the car ? I need some help . - Need some help ? I can 't help you with this thing ! What are you doing ? Not this again , huh ? Could you at least leave your pants on this time ? Great . Just great . There must be a tracking device on me . - Yeah , and ? Look for something unusual . Something hard . Okay . Alright . You stay in shape . What are you doing ? - Nothing ! What do you mean , " park your car ? " - You never heard of valet parking ? Do I look like a valet ? Does this look like Beverly Hills ? Is that supposed to be there ? Yes , yes , it is . It 's very normal . Keep going . Right . Update informational computer scanning system . They 've stopped in front of a single story structure . I think I found something . On the back of your leg . Cut it out . - Cut it out ? Hey , I can 't cut it out . I 'm not gonna cut you . Oh , shit ! You best hurry up and get outta there , I got a business to run here . Take it . - What ? Take it ! - Take it ? - We don 't have much time . Oh God , this is so gross . Oh God , this is so gross . Are you okay ? - Yeah . Good . I gotta lie down . I want a complete scan of the entire area . Enabling infrared . That 's his car . - Scanning for body heat . Got it . - Arms ? Pistol , fully loaded . Desert Eagle . That 's him . Motions and heat scan . Follow tracking . Flanking advance pattern . Three teams . North , East , South , converge on my command . Teams , advance . Surround target .

My name is Sergeant Andrew Scott . Just a mess . Lieutenant , could you contact Colonel Perry ? We want him back in here . You 're wasting your time . He can 't hear you . - Jesus ! I 've relieved Colonel Perry of his command . This mission has been canceled . I order you back to the cooling chamber . Now ! Orders ? I 'm giving the orders from now on . We have a mission to complete . Any questions ? Something to drink ? - Yeah , I 'll have coffee - Ok , you ? Brenda ? Yes , Joe ? You want something to drink ? Soda pop . Great . He 's not gonna make it . - Shut up ! He 'll hear you . If he thinks that we failed he 's gonna kill us both . You just keep working . If he asks anything , stall him . What 's he doing ? Overloading on muscle enhancers . He 's making himself stronger . - Great ! That 's just what we need . I feel like I 'm back in high school again . I can 't make heads or tails out of any of this stuff . But whatever they 've done to you , it 's been done on a genetic level . " ... has warned that cigarettes could be hazardous to your health . " Well , don 't believe everything you read . Hey , that was my last pack ! Are you ready to order ? - Uh , yeah ... Two of your specials . They always refer to a Dr. Gregor . Do you recognize that ? No ? Nothing ? I think I say a number somewhere . - Do you think you can help me ? It 's definitely worth a shot . What ? - Why are you doing all this for me ? I 'm not , alright ? I 'm doing it for me . You may not realize this yet , but you are one hell of a story . I wouldn 't worry . When the truth comes out you 'll probably be a hero . Here we go . C. G. Christopher Gregor . Alright , I 'm gonna go check this out . You just stay here , okay ? Do you have a phone ? - Out there . Here 's your special . Sergeant Scott ? Can I have a word with you ? I 'm all ears . Your thermal monitor . It 's registering hot . Uh-oh . Nap time . What are you , nuts ? Why 'd you tell him that ? Quadruple his serum . What ? I 'm going inside . When he sits down , I 'll give you a signal . You increase the pressure , and I 'll engage the injection device . No , no . It 'll look better if I go . Is there a problem ? No , I 'm just checking the injection device . - Is it broken ? It was making noise . I wanted to make an adjustment . There 's only one way to find out . Let 's see if it still works . Dr. Haines ! Stop it ! Are you ready ? It 's memory clearance time ! Stop it ! You 're gonna kill him ! Stop it ! - Help me ! Shit , a fax . You got enough money for this ? You know , money ? Cash . Dollars . Dinero . Hank ! We got ourselves a deadbeat back here . - What ? He can 't pay . Move it , Brenda . Hey , punk , I 've been slaving all day making that slop . The food is good . - Fuckin A it is . The question is , how are you going to pay for it ? I don 't know . - Ain 't that cute ? I 'm gonna bust your head , punk . I don 't want to hurt you . You don 't want to hurt Hank ? I just want to eat . Operator . - Yeah , a local number . A Doctor Christopher Gregor . Hey , look ! Hey , put that down you son of a bitch ! I 'm gonna make you bleed ! May I help you ? - The Veteran 's hospital address . 1087 Clinton Avenue . - Clinton ? Wonderful . Thank you . Oh , shit . How was lunch ? I 'm looking for a deserter . He 's traveling with a female P. O.W. Beat it , asshole . Nice necklace . I have one made out of noses . They 're in this white and yellow Buick , with no front or rear window . Does that refresh your memory ? GR-74 , Sergeant Scott has issued an order . Will you obey that order ? - Yes , sir . He would like for you to hold this for 30 seconds and then drop it . One , two , three ... I know which way they went . You got a pencil ? - Sure . By the way , I like your belt . Can I have it ? 25 , 26 ... Hey , where 's the freezer ? Can I help you ? - Yes , can we speak with Dr. Gregor ? Do you have an appointment ? Yes , yes we do . Follow me . - Thank you . Wait in there . - Okay , thank you . Oh , God . I 'd kill for a cigarette right now . You would kill someone for a cigarette ? No , it 's an expression . A figure of speech . I wouldn 't actually kill someone for a cigarette . I might hurt ' em real bad , but I don 't think I 'd kill ' em . Dr. Gregor ? Yes , what is it ? - There 's a young couple to see you . They say they have an appointment . - Appointment ? It 's alright , Luc . It 's alright . I saw it . I remember home . - Is he alright ? Let 's get him into the bathroom . We have to cover him with ice . I said stand at attention ! Get up ! The whole fucking platoon 's droppin ' like flies ! What are you staring at ? Do you know what it 's like out there ? Do you ? Well , I 'm fighting this thing ! It 's like , kick ass or kiss ass ! And I 'm busting heads ! It 's the only way to win this fucking war . And these shitheads , these yellow traitoring motherfuckers , they 're everywhere . And I , Sergeant Andrew Scott of the US-Army , I 'm going to teach them all . Hey , freeze ! Drop your weapons ! See ? They 're everywhere . How could you , a doctor , be a party to this ? I 've asked myself that for years . Tell me how it worked . By hyper-accelerating the bodies , we discovered that we could turn dead flesh into living tissue . But to make it work , the bodies ran at dangerously high temperatures and always needed to be cooled , the brain sedated , controlled . Otherwise , they would eventually stroke . - What are you saying ? Excuse me . ... Officials believe Colonel Perry was killed early this morning . Authorities are still looking for Veronica Roberts , believed to be linked to the two deaths . They 've set you up . ... a robbery at Hayes Supermarket . The leader was taped ... Regressive traumatic recall . What ? - Trauma inflicted at the time of death . In Luc 's case , he wanted to go home . When he awoke as a UniSol , he returned to that emotion . But as for Scott , he thinks he 's still in Vietnam fighting the insurgents . He doesn 't realize he 's alive . - He 's not . He 's dead . Just like me . Now boarding , the Los Angeles express . This is insane . You heard the doctor . You need medical help . I think you should turn yourself in and begin treatment again . - And then ? Then we expose everything . Dr. Gregor will help us . I just want to go home . There 's a chance you won 't make it . - I am already dead . No , you 're not , goddamn it ! You are not dead , alright ? You 're alive . And that is precious . You don 't just throw that away . A bus ticket ? What ... - To Los Angeles . What is this for ? You 're safe now . He 's only coming after me . You 're making a big mistake here . You 've got your story , that 's what you wanted . - You think ... You should have left me while you had a chance . What ? Miss all the fun ? Oh shit ! We 're gonna take ' em over to County . Should get there just after lunch . Oh shit ! Get rid of him . Oh shit ! Got you now , boy . Jesus Christ , he 's coming right for us ! Hey , driver , get us out of here ! Holy shit ! Excuse me , you should check on your driver . He don 't look too hot . What do we do now ? - Stop the bus . That 's a great idea . What a concept ! What are you doing now ? What the hell ? Is it working ? Oh , God ! - Do you want to play catch ? Oh shit ! Oh God , I can 't find it ! Here . Are we having fun yet ? Oh , my God ! You jump . What about stopping the bus ? I liked that idea . You jump ! - Not without you . We jump together . - Okay . Oh shit ! Go ! Hit him ! Hit him hard ! Get up , soldier ! Get up ! No ! Freeze ! Now ! Hold it right there ! Turn around ! On your knees , now ! Hands over your heads ! Hands over your head ! I have three brothers . Come on . Let 's go . Key ... Come on , get up ! Money . Got it . Here . Thank you . Come on , let 's go . In the car . I 'll drive . Go on , get in the car . Hurry up ! I 'm gonna take you home . Buckle up . John , somebody 's in the driveway . Bonjour . Mrs. Devreux ? Luc ! This is impossible ... John , come here ! Oh , Luc , my son ! Wait a minute . What do you mean Charles isn 't there ? Where is he ? I don 't care what you 've heard . It 's not true . Yeah , I 'll meet them there . I have to go . A news van is gonna meet me at the sheriff 's station . They still don 't believe me , but I think we can change their minds . Are you okay ? So many things are missing . So many things I remember . So many things I can 't . Luc , it has been 25 years . Such a long time , 25 years . I 'll never get those years back . Look at it this way , you look great for a 50-year-old . Care for a cup , Miss Roberts ? No , I better get going . They 'll be waiting for me . Be careful . It 's turning into a downpour . Goodbye . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . You gonna be alright ? In time . You know something ? I haven 't smoked a cigarette in almost two days . Maybe I 'll quit . I 'll see ya . Where 's the key ? Come on ... Shit ! Looking for something ? Ma ? Ma , are you there ? Devreux ! Devreux , can you hear me ? Nice farm . Exactly like you described it back in ' Nam . You should come out and join our little family reunion . What are you waiting for , farm boy ? Are you deaf ? Get your ass out here ! We have some unfinished business , you and me ! Wow , she really has beautiful ears ! Sarge , you want me ? I 'm here . Let the girl go . - I give the orders here , soldier ! You 're gonna have to learn that . She 's a fuckin ' gook traitor . I gave you an order to kill her . Now you have to fulfill that order . Scott , the war is over . Not for me . Not for her . Not for you . You can 't run from this war , soldier . Not under my command . You 've grown weak . You should have taken your medication . Come on , get up and fight ! Now I 'm gonna teach you about the chain of command ! When I say , " jump , " you say , " how high ? " Got it ? Got it ? Why can 't you get it into your fucking head ? I gave you an order , soldier . Now let me see you waste that gook traitor . Now where are we gonna shoot her ? In the stomach ? No . In the chest ? No . I think we should shoot her in the head ! Ready . Fire ! It 's empty . It 's empty . Luc ! Oh God , help ! Come on ! Luc ! Run ! Run ! Well , that 's the spirit , soldier ! I mean , this is a serious matter , Private . I can 't believe you got your poor folks involved , too . I got a little secret for you , boy . You 're up for court martial ! You ready ? - Give me your best shot . I 'm awfully sorry , but you 're all sentenced to death . Say good night , asshole . Good night , asshole . Well , you 're dead , soldier . No , I 'm alive . You 're discharged , Sarge . You okay ? Dad ? Mom ? Don 't worry about us . Let me help you . Are you okay ? I have a little bit of a headache , but ... Where is he ? Around . How do you feel ? Like a 50-year-old .

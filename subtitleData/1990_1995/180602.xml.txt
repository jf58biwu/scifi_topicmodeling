 [ Woman Narrating ] " Previously on " Earth 2 . [ Screaming ] True ? You all right ? You okay ? Oh , look ! - " [ Uly ] Who is he , Yale ? " - We are trying to find out . - " We would like you " to come with us . - I should like that . Don 't you hurt the others ! Your friends are in peril , Commander . The Terrians . I tried to fight them . What ? What happened ? [ Gaal ] They got him . Ignition , on . Engine , on . Engine , start . Vehicle , start . Move forward . Vehicle , move forward . Drive forward . Vehicle , go . Forward . Start moving . Roll . Drive . Wheels spin . - What are you doing up there ? - Just playing with your toys , poppet . [ Inhales ] Can 't sleep . Just waiting for you all to rise and shine . I 'm not used to all these people around . I 've been alone on this planet so long - 15 years . I guess ... I 'd given up hope of ever seeing a human face again . Such a grim face . What do you want , mister ? I want the same thing you want , poppet . To " fl " y away home . [ True Narrating ] We crashed on this planet two weeks ago , my dad and I. And now , here we are , trapped . Everything here is hard . We have to walk so far every day . Dad says we have to hurry to some place called New Pacifica . But I don 't care about New Pacifica . All I know is it 's hot . And no one lets me do anything . The days just crawl by . And everyone here is a stranger . It was immediately following the East Asian famine which occurred here ... when certain geopolitical alliances were stockpiling grain - [ True Narrating ] It 's not the planet that 's so bad even . It 's the rules . They 're crushing me . There 's even more rules here than on the space stations . I 'm like a prisoner here . Us kids have to wear wristlocks . They monitor our every move , so everyone can panic if we wander , like , two little steps from camp . What is the importance of the Indian-Arctic dispute of 2084 ? True ? True ? Would you like tojoin us ? - I don 't know . - That 's rather premature . You don 't even know the question . Why should I learn all those stupid dates and places ? I mean , we don 't live on the space stations anymore , and we never lived on Earth . We just have to , that 's all . You have to . He 's your teacher . You 're not mine . My father didn 't bring you along for me . [ Scoffs ] Look at Alonzo . That guy 's giving me the creeps . He 's been circling the camp all morning long . Well , we 've got bigger problems . The solar converter 's shattered . Shattered ? This vehicle 's not goin ' anywhere . I can 't believe this is happening to us . We don 't get a day 's relief , Yale . What 's going on ? It appears our friend Gaal found a little something on his morning constitutional . [ Danziger ] What ? That crate he 's got Devon looking at ? You know , your boss is a little too friendly for my taste . She 's a smart woman , John . Definitely from our cargo pod . It 's two containers - one 's clothing , the other we don 't know . Gaal thinks it must 've been the Grendlers . I 'm gonna send a recon party to see if there 's any more of our cargo in the area . Well , you tell ' em to take as long as they like ' cause that dune-rail 's gonna keep us here . - Crystal fuse is missing . - What do you mean missing ? - Missing . - Can you fix it ? I might be able to retrofit something but ... I 'd say two days , at least . [ Sighs ] Listen , Adair . A word of advice . We don 't know anything about that guy , and I don 't trust him . I just like to know the people I don 't trust , Danziger . [ Sighs ] Geez . Whoa ! What is it ? Treasure ? There 's some kind of vitrification process to preserve whatever 's in these capsules . They 're sealed . Probably heat sensitive . So what does that mean ? Is it alive ? Just let the good doctor do her work , child . Let 's hope it 's vegetation . Like canned vegetables ? One of Devon 's botanists created a biosphere ... which would allow seedlings to germinate and grow without sunlight or water . So it 's a tree ? Maybe a whole forest of trees ? Let 's hope it 's a tomato plant . We could use some fresh produce . We 'll just have to wait and see what develops . We just need to - Here we go . [ Beeping ] Can I watch it for a while ? Well , judging by this readout , maturation could take several hours . [ Beeping Continues ] Please ? I 'm through with school for the day . Okay , if you 're careful . It 'll be a pleasure to have such a smart assistant . Just don 't meddle . It 's obviously a delicate item . Can I be of assistance , friend ? No . Thanks . I work solo . I see the Grendlers have been up to their usual mischief . Yeah . It 's amazing how those Grendlers knew just what to hit . Yeah . Well , if there 's any way that I can aid the cause - [ Chuckles ] Hey , sport . Hi . What 's up ? Thought you were in school ? You know , maybe it 'd be better if I helped you out here . You know , plenty of time for school later . Am I right ? Uh-huh . Give me a number seven , will ya ? I mean , I 'm just in the way there and I should be helping you out here . Well , you know how much I want you to get a real education , sweetheart . Don 't worry , you 'll get used to it . Can I at least take this stupid wrist alarm - True ! Enough . I 'm working . I hate this planet ! What you looking at ? Okay , Mr. Solace , no more moping around . [ Sighs ] I made you a leg brace . I 'm gonna get you started on a physical therapy regime and get you walking again . So I can walk to New Pacifica ? I 'm not interested . Well , I 'm not gonna carry you . Good . [ Uly ] Oh , my God . ! It 's alive . ! Mom , it 's moving ! Mom , come here ! It 's really alive ! What ? What is it ? Oh , my God . What is it ? What 's happening in here ? [ Danziger ] What is that ? I don 't know . I - I thought it was some sort of vegetation . - Don 't - Don 't touch it ! It 's coming at us ! - " [ Bess ] Morgan . " - " [ Danziger ] Caution people . " - " [ Yale ] It needs to get out . " [ All Gasping ] - [ Whinnying ] - Oh , my God ! It 's an " Equus callabus . " A horse ? We have a horse . [ Morgan ] It 's impossible . Horses don 't grow up in an hour - Oh , my God . ! It was like a womb . It was an embryo . Placenta all around it . Amniotic fluid to suspend its life . - You can 't touch him . Pegasus is too fragile . - " [ Devon ] Uly . " You did . And why 's his name suddenly Pegasus ? Just is , that 's all . Is there another one of these things ? The last thing we need around here is two horses we don 't know how to care for . But I 'll take care of it . No , sweetheart . It 's not a matter of taking care of it . The group has to agree . Well , why do I have to be a part of this group ? Hey , come on now , sport . True ? A horse , Morgan . Worked wonders , my friend . They won 't be going anywhere without the dune-rail 's vital organ . In days , I 'll have won them over . [ Beeping ] - True , what 're you doing ? - Nothing . True , you shouldn 't have done that . [ Beeping Continues ] I just wanted my own horse . Horsie ? Julia , where is she ? True , I have some bad news . What ? No . The other horse , I 'm sorry . She didn 't make it . What 'd you do to her ? I didn 't do anything . I think the incubator was damaged in the crash . I don 't know . It just didn 't grow . [ Pegasus Whinnies ] One horse is gonna be plenty . I 'll make sure Uly shares . I promise . True , wait . ! You 're doing such a good job . Come on , boy . There . Is she okay ? [ Uly ] You 're a nice boy , Pegasus . Yeah . - [ Sighs ] - " Mom , look . ! Look at him . " He 's gigantic and he 's tame . Julia says he 's made that way . God , it 's unreal , that kind of growth . What 's it been , 12 hours ? No . Not even . I 've never seen such a rapid escalation in development . That horse , its genetic growth braking mechanism is not kicking in . If it continues growing at this pace , it 'll be dead in 48 hours . [ Sobbing ] Is that you , poppet ? Don 't tell anybody I 'm here , okay ? Of course . Of course . Um , why are you so wretched ? Has someone done you harm ? My horse died . Oh , I 'm so sorry . That is very sad . Julia says that Uly will share , but I know he won 't . No , he won 't . He won 't ? Nope . He is a spoiled , avaricious brat , incapable of generosity . That much is obvious . Believe me , he 's not of your caliber . It 's so unfair . I hate this dirty , filthy planet . I want my horse . A horse . A horse . My kingdom for a horse . [ Chuckles ] Shall I show you something ? Hmm . Come here . I think you 'll fancy this . See that ? Just a bud and ... Presto ! - Wow ! - See , my poppet , this isn 't such a bad place after all . This is a place where magic happens , where wishes can come true . How 'd you do that ? [ Mumbling ] We - No . How do I know if I can trust you ? You can trust me . Please ? Trust must be forged by mutual fire . You tell me some secret , and I will divulge mine . But I don 't know any secrets . Nonsense . You 're full to the brim with them . I know a good brain when I see one . True , you could tell me about those wheeled beasts of burden . What ? The vehicles , my lamb . I 've seen you . You could tell me about them . Yeah , I could . Well , there you are . We 're in business . [ High-pitched Tone , Beeping ] Oh ! I hate this thing . What is it ? Stupid magnetic wristlock . Blares if I 'm , like , a hundred yards away from camp . Any lock can be unlocked , poppet . True , I 've been looking for you everywhere for almost an hour . [ Beeping Stops ] Now come on , camp 's been worried . My pleasure , Miss True . You 've got to be careful , True . You never know what dangers are lurking out there . I can 't take this , Bess . Not two years of this . Horses magically popping out of cans . No real food . No decent toilets . I don 't mind it . Why do you say things like that , Bess ? To drive me crazy ? You loved our life back home . Our unit , all your appliances , all the perks that goes along with being a government liaison 's wife . Yes , I did , but I like it here just as well . Oh , dear . What ? What " Oh , dear " ? I hate your " Oh , dears , " Bess . They 're never good . Well , Morgan , we have two boxes of alpha-glutenate missing . Missing ? Gone ? Food ? What are you talking about ? Are you sure you counted right ? Morgan , it 's not here . But we 've got 16 mouths to feed , Bess . Seventeen , including Gaal . This is intolerable . We 're just eking by as it is . Two boxes ! Morgan - Don 't Morgan me ! I 've gotta go report this to Devon . There you go , Pegasus . Can you believe I never even saw a real live horse before yesterday ? Mom says I 'll be able to ride you soon . - Julia . Julia ! - " Yes ? " Look . ! What is it ? It 's awful . ! [ Sighs ] His epidermis can 't regenerate the cells it 's losing fast enough . He 's aging far too quickly . Is it bad ? A horse doesn 't usually grow up overnight , Uly . Pegasus can . He 's magic . No , he 's sick . And I 'm gonna need to try and alter his pituitary gland , help him age normally . So no more riding him or feeding him , okay ? The most important thing is that he gets plenty of rest . We have a new problem . Two boxes of food supplies are missing . We 're going to have to start rationing . I suppose Gaal would say the Grendlers took the boxes . He 's a human being . We can 't just leave him here . No . Not without a substantive reason . No . No , not without a substantive reason . [ Chattering ] Up , up , up , up , up . Up . ! [ Danziger ] Hey , Morgan . You burn it , you waste it . That 's all you get . We don 't have enough rations for ourselves . Why are we subsidizing a dying horse ? It makes no sense . The horse can 't even be ridden . We should make a meal of it . Throw it on the fire . At least it would be good for something . Morgan ! That 's the spirit . Just keep up those happy thoughts , guys . Is this the first-class section ? I was just thinking . Yeah ? What about ? [ Sighs ] Oh , about how we 've been here two weeks ... and everybody seems to be falling apart at the seams . I thought that morale hit bottom when we crashed . Well , there 's always further to go . You think we 're cursed , Danziger ? Excuse me ? I don 't know . First , uh , we crash into the planet . Then we lose most of our supplies . Then , uh , O 'Neill gets killed . And just when it seemed like we might be getting some equilibrium , there 's the , uh , solar fuse , the rations , the ... horse dying . Well ... I 've never been much of a believer in curses . I tend to think bad things happen for a reason . Hang in there . You should see , he can 't even ride and I can . Faster than the wind , I 'll wager . At a synth-arcade , no one broke my record , and it was my first time . I stayed on the bronco for 22 minutes . Longer even . - I just wish - - What ? What do you wish ? No . It 's a bad thought . Bad thought ? No such animal , not on this planet . Now come , tell me . What notion could be so black ? I just wish that Uly hadn 't gotten better . Then I 'd have the horse all to myself . Well , of course you wish that . That 's only natural . Really ? He possesses what you desire . You must remember , little one , there 's no such thing as right or wrong . Not here . Here you must take what is yours . What is it ? It 's the emblem of true genius . Only a secret few have one . You could perhaps wear it , if you pass the test . What test ? Show me what knowledge is hidden in that golden head . There aren 't too many secrets , just words . Like , um , " Open sesame " ? Kinda . Just say , " Vehicle , start . " Vehicle , start . Now , poppet , you told me you knew how to operate these animals . I do . You just say , " Vehicle , start , " then " Forward roll " or " Left side steer . " I don 't know what 's the matter . It always works . Vehicle , start , damn it ! Move ! It - It won 't go . I can see that . - Come on , you heap ! - It won 't help , you doing that . You piece of junk . Come on , start . True , girl . - Come on . Time for bed . - Coming . [ Snores ] [ Beeping ] [ Snoring ] Whoa , Pegasus . [ Whinnies ] Whoa . I found you . I passed the test you gave me . I didn 't think I could . I never doubted you for an instant , poppet . Did you accomplish the other task I set for you ? Mm-hmm . I did the bracelet just like you told me to . It was as easy as you said . And I put it just where you told me to . What a keen student . You amaze me , poppet . I couldn 't be more proud . Makes me wish you were my very own daughter . Well , one never knows what might happen . I 'd be a good father , True . [ Yale ] Mr. Martin . Morgan , may I have a word with you ? Mm-mmm . In your official capacity as Deputy Secretary of Interstellar Development , of course . I 'm trying to sleep , you know . It 's no secret , Morgan , that you were pretty high up in the space station hierarchy . Well , thank you , Yale . I ... I worked hard . I need a little information about a possible government program ... going by the acronym E2 ? You mean the sanitation system ? No , no , no . Possibly something involving interstellar growth . Uh , maybe a program that jettisoned astronauts outward ... possibly to a planet ? Ring any bells ? Oh , I - I really don 't know . I - I wasn 't that high up . Why did you say " sanitation system " ? Almost there . There . [ Clears Throat ] Mr. Danziger , I must apologize for my unseemly behavior yesterday . You mean beating on my trans-rover ? My temper got the best of me . I 'm still so unused to conducting myself around humans . Yeah ? Well , maybe you ought to consider spending more time alone . Don 't think my vehicles could take the abuse ... what with all these Grendlers wandering around . Your vehicles ? I thought Ms. Adair - Look , you wanna come with us , that 's not for me to decide . But we got rules . And one of those rules is all these vehicles around here are my responsibility . And being that they 're my responsibility , nobody touches them but me , you got that ? I apologize for any harm I may have done to your machine . I guess we both better watch our step around here . You just stay away from me and what 's mine . By the way , I 've locked that trans-rover onto my voiceprint only , just for safekeeping . [ Nickers Feebly ] He looks ten times worse . He 'll wake up soon , right ? You 'll make him all healthy , right ? I promised him you would . [ Sighs ] Uly , re-altering D.N.A. is very , very difficult , and I don 't even have a full laboratory . So both of us are just gonna have to keep our fingers crossed , okay ? Don 't worry . Dr. Julia 's gonna make you all better . [ Mumbling ] Mr. Danziger has disappointed me for the last time . [ Growling , Indistinct ] We 'll kill him soon . Luckily , I 've taken from Danziger something more precious than life - his little girl . [ Gaal ] True knows enough about the vehicles to suit our needs . [ Grendler Growling ] [ Gaal ] She 'll be able to crack any codes her father has locked onto the vehicle 's database . It shall be yours . Assume the beggar 's position and be rewarded . Rise . Tasty , isn 't it ? [ Snaps ] My , poppet , what big eyes you have . [ True ] Oh , no . I won 't hurt you . You-You - You put blood - You-You fed your blood to the Grendlers . My father was right . All you want is our stuff . You 're nothing but - but a lying thief . You - Shh . Little poppet . So much anger , so much fear , so much venom . Let it go . Don 't touch me ! I am the wronged party , little one . Your father has banished me . He doesn 't want me around you . He wants you to be obedient , pliant , and he 'll erase anyone who inspires you , challenges you to greatness . No . Oh , yes , my dove . Why does he try to kill your sparkle , your spirited voice ? Why does he manacle you with that wrist bracelet ? I can 't come with you . I only wanted to follow you . That was my only motivation for a vehicle . My father didn 't say you couldn 't come with us . Oh , yes , he did . And I go with a heavy heart . Because you and I , we 're kindred spirits , aren 't we ? You must trust me , poppet . dd [ Whistles ] Fashioned especially for you . You whistle and I will come for you . The Grendlers know how to find me . Uh , I don 't think my father would like me whistling for you . Whistle for yourself , True . What do you think , cowboy ? [ Chuckles ] You want to take him for a ride ? You did it ! Look at him ! He 's amazing ! You still gotta be careful . There we go . True . True , guess what ? He 's okay . He 's gonna live . [ Sighs ] [ Whispering ] Offer her a ride on Pegasus . You wanna take a ride ? I know Pegasus would like it . Just a short one . We 're packing up camp . Your dad fixed the dune-rail . [ Sighs ] No , thanks . Hey , Yale , are you okay , man ? I 'm fine , Alonzo . I 'm just in the middle of something . [ Whinnying ] dd [ Whistling ] You got that ? [ Yale ] John ? John ? John ? Yeah . Have you seen Gaal ? Why ? What happened ? The E2 tattoo on Gaal 's neck . I 've been scanning my memory for some reference to it . It 's a refuse disposal program . Wait a minute . Slow down here . Our government has been using this planet as a judicial dumping ground . Dumping ground ? A penal colony , John . Prisoners , murderers , political enemies , heretics . They have found some way to jettison them here . Gaal . Where 's True ? True ? We have to tell Devon . No , no , I gotta find her . True ! The horse is missing . Have you seen it ? John , what are you doing ? Show me the tracks . Poppet . Look . ! Look what I brought you . He 's for you . Now you 'll be able to follow us . A horse ? I had thought a wheeled vehicle . If I had wanted a horse , I would have asked for one , True . But you said you wanted to follow us . And ... he can run real , real fast . As fast as the dune-rail . Faster . And Pegasus is all healthy now . - Did anyone see you leave ? - No one . I ditched the bracelet again . You have valor in you , True . True valor . We 'll get our vehicles yet . Come on . Let 's ride together , you and I. Let 's ride the wind . ! I can 't . They 'll miss me back at camp . Trust me , poppet . [ Danziger ] True . ! I thought you went unnoticed ? I did . He 's coming for you . Come , quickly ! There 's no time ! Move ! [ Screams ] - Get in . - Daddy . Daddy , please don 't hurt him . It was my fault . I was the one - I said get in here . Come on ! You take the wheel . Vehicle , halt ! Crazy ! You might 've killed me ! You stay there . [ Grunts ] No , Daddy . Daddy , please . Gaal didn 't do anything . It was all my fault . True , you let me handle this . Now , don 't you move , not a muscle , not a finger , because I will kill you . [ True ] No , Daddy , please . You would kill me in cold blood ... in front of your daughter ? No . No , he won 't . He - He 's just mad at me . True , be quiet . Get back . I don 't know what you are , but I know you 're not an astronaut . And I can only guess what you 're capable of . But you better hear me . You come within 10 miles of us - hell , a hundred miles - and I will shoot you in cold blood ... in front of my daughter - do you understand me ? - Do be careful with that gun . - Do you understand me ? I understand you . Don 't blame your daughter , sir . The blame rests on me . I 'm sorry , poppet . I guess I won 't be able to follow you after all . Don 't you say a word to him . Get back in the rail . [ True Narrating ] He was the man who called me poppet . And I never even got to find out what poppet means . My dadjust stole me back to my old boring life of school and rules by the millions . But I wasn 't sad . I knew we 'd meet again . Somewhere . Somehow . 'Causejust like Gaal says , this is the land where magic happens . [ Narrator ] " Next on " Earth 2 . - " [ Danziger ] " Alonzo heard from the Terrians . - They 're in some kind of trouble . I think they 're being captured or locked up somewhere . If they could do this to Uly , we need to stay as far away from them as possible . - She 's with him ! Change of plans ! We leave now ! - " [ True Screaming ] " No . ! Daddy , look out . !

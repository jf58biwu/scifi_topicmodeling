 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ music continues ] [ music continues ] Don 't you ever even think about using a door ? It 's midnight , I 'm here . So you are . Very prompt and very brave considering you know I 've got the kryptonite . Gee , I wish I could admire that . This time , however , I 'm opting for a certain irony in having you meet your end at the hands of a , uh .. [ laughing ] ... friend . [ intense music ] Bizarro . [ groaning ] I know just how you feel . I hate family reunions . [ beeping ] ( male # 1 ) And what happened then ? ( Lana ) Uh , Bizarro Lana came out . [ computer beeping ] [ music continues ] [ computer beeping ] ( Dennis ) I don 't believe it . But then again , I never thought they 'd be able to colorize old films . ( male # 2 ) This makes colorization look like tic-tac-toe . But how ? I mean , there weren 't any video cameras there . How could they know what it all looked like ? All it needs to recreate an incident are some pictures of the location , couple of snapshots of the participants .. ... and an eyewitness account . That 's not the best part . The computer 's hooked into over a thousand data banks throughout the world . They could tell you almost anything about these people . Want me to bring up , say , Darla 's medical records ? Ah , that 's alright . So , what do you think ? - I 'm a little overwhelmed . - Ha ha . Understandable . I 'll tell you what .. ... I 'm gonna leave this thing here until tomorrow morning . No charge . Use it . Get to know it . Then we 'll talk price , okay ? Okay ? I 'm gonna come back here tonight . What for ? This computer is gonna tell me something I 've always wanted to know . - And what 's that ? - Who Superboy is ? [ dramatic music ] [ computer beeping ] [ siren blaring ] [ intense music ] ( male # 3 ) Stay back ! ( male # 4 ) No , please ! [ music continues ] - Oh ! - Oh , my God ! [ cackling ] - What 're you doing ? - I 'll get through that line . That 's a bureau badge , not a press pass . So , who 's got time to read ? You coming ? [ music continues ] ( all ) Oh ! [ gunshot ] [ firing continues ] [ music continues ] I want Superboy ! [ music continues ] ( male # 5 ) Oh , my God ! [ applause ] You want me ? Here I am . ( Lana ) Okay , now , here 's the beauty of this thing . [ computer beeping ] - That 's what I need ? - It 's just a crowd . Reconstructed from news photos , videos . And Superboy has to be one of them . See , all I have to do is go over the police reports for our witness identifications and descriptions . And then just do a visual scan . ( Clark ) So now you 've got a lot of names . He could be any one , if he 's there at all . Oh , he 's there alright . ( Lana ) He 's gotta have a second identity . That 's why he always shows up at the right moment . Maybe he just flies in at the last minute . Why does he have to be in the crowd ? Well , we 'll find out . There 'll be a lot fewer names once I cross reference . - Cross reference ? - Yeah . [ computer beeping ] - But you don 't understand , I- - - Sure I do . There 's a werewolf running loose . It 's his job . He works here . Him and I go bowlin ' on weekends . [ werewolf growling ] No , this is a real one . It- - [ werewolf growling ] [ intense music ] [ theme music ] [ werewolf growling ] [ crowd screaming ] [ computer beeping ] ( Lana ) First , we 'll I.D. them , the same way we did before .. [ computer beeping ] ... and then we 'll cross reference .. ... and see who was at both incidents . [ intense music ] Just ... you and me . - That must mean that- - - I know what it means , Lana . Do you ? I 'd really like to hear . It means that Superboy doesn 't just have a second identity . He could have a third and a fourth , even hundreds . He could 've looked different at each incident . Yeah ... he could have . But that means I 've to go back over everything and do background searches on everyone in the crowd . Got to be thorough . [ computer beeping ] Is this the Bureau of Extra-Normal Matters ? - Yeah , but we 're closed . - This will only take a minute . It 's about this rock we dug up on the site today . Well , what about it ? Well , uh , you 're gonna think I 'm crazy . - It 's makin ' noises . - Noises ? What kind of noises ? Words ? Sentences ? Haikus ? Hey , I know what I heard . If you 're not interested , I 'll just take this thing someplace else where they are .. [ dramatic music ] - Something .. - Superboy . ( male # 6 ) Careful . [ intense music ] ( male # 7 ) Incredible . I think it 's some kind of meteorite . Whatever it is , we 've got to find a safe place for it . [ rumbling ] [ explosion ] [ dramatic music ] [ groaning ] No ! [ computer beeping ] Where did all these unknowns come from ? Clients , temps , passersby . I 'm lucky I remembered them all . Now , you wanna go for a pizza ? One-one last cross reference , okay ? But you don 't really have to . It 's just gonna check on which people have never been there when Superboy showed up . There probably won 't eve .. [ intense music ] [ computer beeping ] [ chuckling ] You think I 'm Superboy ? [ laughing ] That 's crazy ! Look , I mean , there are lots of people who aren 't around when Superboy shows up . And who 's always gone when Superboy 's gone . What do you mean ? ( Lana ) Watch . - Morning , Lana . - Hey , Clark . Looks like it 's gonna be a nice day ? Mm-hmm . You know that benefit Matt was talking about ? Sounded like fun , huh ? You don 't get to go to something like that too often . [ tires screeching ] - Was wondering if you wanted- - - Somebody 's gonna get killed . - Pardon ? - Look . [ tires screeching ] [ whistling ] [ whistling continues ] [ tires screeching ] [ intense music ] I 'm sorry , what were you say .. [ whistling ] Where were you when that happened ? ( Clark ) I know this sounds really lame but I had to make an emergency call . What about the time he lost his memory ? [ computer beeping ] [ intense music ] [ theme music ] [ explosion ] Thinking about Superboy ? Yeah . He 'll turn up . Well , the news reports haven 't been very encouraging . Come on . Remember who we 're talkin ' about here ? I 'm sure you 're right . [ computer beeping ] ( Lana ) He was right . Superboy did come back . Just about the same time you did . So , where were you ? Or don 't you remember ? Oh , I remember . ( Clark ) Lang , I 'll give you all the explanations you want but that 's not the real issue . No ? Then what is ? These recreations are based upon your memories . And when Superboy 's around , you don 't notice me . A-are you jealous ? Jealous ? Well , what do you think ? It 's all over you . ( Clark ) Well , I guess I must not be Superboy . I couldn 't be jealous of myself , could I ? You 're just trying to throw off suspicion . I mean , if you 're not Superboy .. ... then you 'll let me try one more thing . What 's that ? I 'm gonna combine all the programs together . Then I 'm gonna let the computer decide who Superboy is . Unless you have a problem with that . No problem . I 'll even press the key . [ computer beeping ] You wrecked it ! [ computer beeping ] ( Clark ) It 's running your program . [ computer beeping ] - What is all this , then , huh ? - It must be stuff you put in . [ computer beeping ] I-I can 't . I can 't stop this . [ computer beeping ] [ assault gun firing ] [ firing continues ] [ explosion ] [ explosion ] [ firing continues ] Fire ! [ theme music ] [ assault gun firing ] [ dramatic music ] Those men almost took over the city . [ intense music ] Whoa ! Run ! [ music continues ] What took you so long ? He risked his life to save me . ( male # 8 ) You mustn 't do this . With his demented mind and my powers he 'll turn the world into a .. He 's got to be stopped . Frankly , I don 't see the problem . I mean , it 's pretty obvious who is who here . Luthor . He 's Luthor . Sure he is . You have to listen to this . ( man # 1 on recorder ) Deland was the only one that knew about our little switcheroo . - And so , you killed him ? - Of course , I killed him . Let 's do it . [ electricity buzzing ] Did it work ? No . No . No ! No , no , no .. ... no ! We did it . I figured it out . He tricked Luthor . He got lucky . You are jealous , aren 't you ? Was it luck ? He 's always got a plan . Even if it 's taking a second identity ? ( Lana ) Yeah . Yeah , even that . I 'm not sure , but if I know Superboy .. ... he 's always got a reason for everything he does . Maybe to protect himself . Or us . Or us . Yeah , it 's probably for us . Lana .. What are you doing ? - I must 've been crazy . - Huh ? I deleted everything . I thought you wanted to find out- - I did . But if he wants to keep something secret from us I think we should respect him . Don 't you think ? Now , how about that pizza ? Absolute .. [ alarm ringing ] You know , I 'm not hungry anymore . Maybe tomorrow ? [ siren wailing ] - Clark . - I have to , uh .. ... go . I wouldn 't dream of stopping you . Goodnight . [ theme music ]

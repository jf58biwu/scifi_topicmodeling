Yet another open conflict ... Oh , fuck this ! Get me out of here ! Argh ! We 're in a war zone , Dave : two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire , ... .. the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate , heroic attempts . It 's completely out of control down here . My beautiful cantina , everything I own , they shot it to pieces . My microwave , my automatic steamer , my grill ... You fucking pendejos ! ( automatic gunfire ) Ah ! Ha-ha ! Fuck you ! Tony Pope , live with Hard Core , on the scene andin yourface . It 's like Dante 's hell . Smoke , fire , oppressive heat , ... .. as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends again transform LA into a slaughterhouse . Who the hell 's in charge down here ? The cops ? Uh-uh . They 're outmanned , outgunned and incompetent . Mr Mayor , on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe , ... .. get off your butt , get down here and declare martial law ! OK , don 't keep me in suspense , Danny boy ! It has not been a nice day ! Two motors pulled over a truck , stumbled right in the middle of a narc stakeout . You know , ten Colombians and Scorpios armed to fuck all . They 're trying to get in their headquarters . We 're keeping them pinned down , but those officers are bleeding to death . Fuck ! They 're dying , man . Where the hell is Special Weapons ? They 're still tied up in that shootout in San Pedro with the Jamaicans . They shot down a chopper . Mills and Johnson won 't last much longer . We need an assault vehicle to go get ' em . I 'm gonna chat with these assholes . - When I give the signal , give me some cover ! - Got it ! Too small .

Danny , get me off this damn roof . - You get the rest of them ? - Somebodybeat us to it . ( glass breaking ) Leona . Oh , shit . - What happened to EI Scorpio ? - He 's out front having lunch . What the hell is this ? I don 't know . They 've been cut to pieces . - Must be the Jamaicans . - Their style , but where the hell did they go ? OK , nobody gets in here until Forensic arrives . Nobody . OK , you know the drill . ( glass shatters ) Mike . Up there . He must have been killed out here , and then someone ... That 's about 35 , 40 feet . No rope , no ladder . The guy weighs about 190 , 195 pounds . You couldn 't carry him up there . Lieutenant ? Deputy Chief Heinemann 's downstairs . He wants you out of the building now . Ah , son of a bitch . What the fuck is going on ? ( Danny ) This is not good , Mike . Not good at all . ( snarling ) - I want a real name on this joker , OK ? - You got it . Mike . Phil , this is quite a surprise . What brings you down from the palace ? You let me down , Mike . You 're making me look bad . I thought we had an understanding . I put my ass on the line to get you here , ... .. and all I expect is a little cooperation ! You were told this was a federal matter . Yet you disobeyed an order to stay out of the building . Don 't let this get out , Phil , but it 's a fucking war down here . ( distorted ) Soldiers take orders . Don 'tpush it ! I 'llpush itas faras I can , Phil , cos we 're fighting for ourlives here , ... .. while you 're downtown pushingpencils andkissing ass ! I don 't roll over for anybody , especially the feds , ... .. without a goddamn good explanation ! Take this equipment up to the third floor . Come on , let 's move ! - Let 's go . - ( woman ) Excuse me , sir ! What the hell is going on here , Heinemann ? Insubordination . Disregard for direct orders from a supervising officer . Now get back to your cage at Alvarado . - I 'll show you insubordination , you son of ... - No , no , no ! Where you running to ? Come here ! You don 't need this , Mike . It 's not worth it . Relax . Oh , fuck ! ( # Spanish rap music ) ( shouting ) ( TonyPope ) lhave an update foryou . In a shootout , five members ofone Colombian drug gang ... .. were ambushedby theirbloody rivals , the Jamaican Voodoo Posse , ... .. who escaped withouta trace - ha ! - again making totalfools of ... - A detective is here to see you . - Back there . Listen , lady , you got a backed-up toilet . Call a plumber , not the cops . - This licence has expired . - Bullshit ! I paid that fee six months ago . - I 'll kick your ass ! - Sit down ! Right now ! - Move ! Get your ass movin ' ! - Just calm the fuck down ! What you lookin ' at ? And all you got to do ... .. is tee it high and let it fly . Ow ! Dead solid perfect . Now , remember , for distance you gotta gently but firmly grip the club . Lieutenant Harrigan ! Detective Lambert , Rampart Division . Hey , kid , just have a seat . I 'll be right with you . - Hey , Cap . - Don 't start , Mike . Heinemann 's already been up my ass so far I won 't be able to sit down for a week . We 're not winning this war . As much as it 'll piss you off , you 'll have to play the game . " Effective immediately , a federal task force under Special Agent Peter Keyes ... .. will investigate criminal activities involving the trafficking of controlled substances . " And you willextend him your full cooperation . So you 're cutting off my dick and shoving it up my ass . The feds are calling the shots on this . My hands are tied ! - Yeah ? - Captain Pilgrim , Peter Keyes . - It 's good to meet you . - And you , sir . Lieutenant Mike Harrigan . Special Agent Peter Keyes , DEA . Heard a lot about you . I 'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion . Don 't mean to be stepping on your toes . But we want to prevent King Willie 's voodoo gangs from taking over the entire West Coast . I wish I could tell you more . But we have a large number of deep-cover operatives involved . You know how it is . We all have ajob to do . Now , I 'm sure we can respect each other 's situation and act responsibly . Well , ... .. um , cooperation ... .. is my middle name . I 'll see you around . - I 'm the new transfer , Jerry Lambert . - Like I said , have a seat . I 'll be right with you . - Who is this dude ? - Yeah , what an asshole . All right , Danny boy , what we got ? What have we got ? Five lowlife Scorpions make it into the building . The next minute ... they 're all shish kebab . Not one bullet wound . It wasn 't drugs or money . There 's a shitload of that . Maybe King Willie brought in some outside talent . He 's making his big move . A pro would have split the moment he heard us . More than one , we would have seen them . Whoever did this waited until the last minute , ... .. and then took out four men armed with machine guns by hand ! And then got by us . Maybe we should give him ajob . Let 's put him on the payroll . So me and my partner bolt up the stairs , somebody is screaming bloody murder ... - You gotta ... You gotta hear this . - What ? ! Hey . Hey , I forgot to tell you . See that guy there ? That 's Ferris 's replacement . This guy 's Jerry Lambert . The Lone Ranger from Rampart station . That 's the Lone Ranger ? I thought he was here to fix the air conditioning . I said " Lady , you are under arrest . " And she said " Why ? " I said " Because your husband is dead . You killed him . " - Know what she said , didn 't miss a beat ? - Uh , no . She said " I stabbed that son of a bitch plenty oftimes . He never died on me before . " ( Leona laughs ) Oh-oh . - Looks like he 's putting the moves to Leona . - ( Mike groans ) His first big mistake . I have heard about you . - Yeah ? - Yeah ! - Like your last partner got shot . - What ? Well ... - Oy ! - You try that cowboy shit with me , fucker , ... .. you can kiss these goodbye . - Got it ? - Yeah , I got it . Unhh ! Well , well , I see that the three of you have met . Lambert , if you 're feeling up to it , ... .. why don 't you limp your way in to the lieutenant . He wants to talk to you . Yeah . Aauughh ! - You 're a bad girl . - Ooh , I like that . No , no , no ! Goddamn , is that bitch on the rag or what ? This is what I call " the speech " , kid . I only give it once , so pay attention . Until now , it 's all been fun and games , cops and robbers , dunking doughnuts . But you 're in the shit now . Metro Command is a war zone . Lieutenant , I 've paid my dues . I had to bust my ass to get my transfer . And that scares the shit out of me , kid . No one requests to come here unless they want a reputation . There 's no room for anyone looking to prove themselves . I won 't stand for it . Don 't get me wrong . We need good cops , and they say you 're good at what you do . But the team comes first . You live by that , and you 'll be OK . And we 'll all be there for you . Remember , the door swings both ways . That 's it . Hey , kid . Welcome to the war . ( moaning ) ( ecstatic screaming ) - ( men shouting ) - ( woman screaming ) ( woman ) No ! ( man ) OK , guys . This has gone too far now , huh ? Hey , hey , guys . I-l-l know you 're trying to scare me , huh ? Well , you did a pretty good job , man . I 'm scared now . Stop it now . I can pay you . - $ 2 million , man . In cash . - ( man chuckles ) - Right now ! - This is not about money . This is about power ! There 's a new king in the streets . This is a message he has for your people . - You are history . - ( chokes ) Fucking history , goddamn puto . ( pants ) What the fuck are you doing now , man ? You 're crazy ! King Willie says ... .. not only do I have to kill you , ... .. but I have to take your soul . Voodoo magic . Fucking voodoo magic , man . ( laughs ) But you know what ? I tell you what I believe . Shit happens . ( woman screams ) ( snarling ) Argh ! Shoot it ! Argh ! Fucker ! Aargh ! ( predator ) Sh ... shithappens . Shithappens . Aah ! I 'm standing just outside a penthouse complex in San Pedro ... .. involving as many as 20 people . It 's uncertain who they were . One report indicates it might be the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse . I go in for my physical and the doctor says " I need a semen , stool and urine sample . " I say " Gee , doc , I 'm in a big hurry . Can I just leave my underwear ? " Oh , God . Achtung , mein Kapitan ! Word is there may be as many as 50 more dead bodies up there . Oh , man , it 's Pope . That parasite must live in his car . I 'll handle it . PR 's my specialty . Word is they want your ass off the job . - Tony ! - Who the hell are you ? Your biggest fan ! Catch your show all the time . - I got ajob to do ! - Yourjob is to root for garbage elsewhere . - Been inside ? - Yeah . We were gonna go in with our guys , ... .. but we were told on a radio transmission nobody goes in under any circumstances . ( police radio ) All units , be advised . Federal offcers willhandle investigation . - We didn 't hear that . Let 's go . - You 're the boss . This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live ... Hey , nice flashlight . Mind if I borrow it ? OK . Damn ! Look familiar ? Aah ! Fuck . Oh , God . ( Mike ) Ramon Vega , the crack king . Biggest operator in East LA . 100 keys a week . - Why isn 't he skinned ? And who are they ? - ( Danny ) Jamaicans . King Willie 's boys . ( Leona ) That makes no sense . This was a voodoo ritual . I 've seen it before . They took his heart out . - What for ? - Terror tactics , man . You know , to scare the shit out of their enemies . - King Willie . - Who the hell is King Willie ? King Willie , voodoo priest of the LA posses . Ran the terror gangs for Edward Seaga in Jamaica ... .. till he got too powerful . The Jamaican chiefs won 't make a move without his approval . So what the fuck happened ? Shit ! ( Danny ) Hey , we got a survivor ! ( whimpering ) What 's she saying ? I don 't know . She 's not making any sense . She keeps saying " EI diablo vino por ellos . " The devil came for them . If it 's the Colombians , why 'd they leave their boss hanging and his girl naked on the floor ? - It wasn 't the Colombians . - Our friend from the armoury . Right . We got a new player in town . Come over here , Mike . Check this out . What is that ? ( Mike ) Looks like a spear tip or something . ( Keyes ) This is a restricted area . I want it cleared immediately . You 're walking on physical evidence . - We 'll take care of her . - She 's with me . Lieutenant , I 'd like a word with you in private , please . They say that persistence is your most outstanding quality . - I know this is your show ... - You 're not listening to me ! You got a big nose and you 're sticking it too far in my business . Maybe you can hear this . The next time you cross me , ... - .. you 're gonna turn up missing . - ( crunching ) - Garber , the man with the camera . Get him . - Yes , sir . - All right . Let 's go . - Stay away . - Hey , fuck you , man ! Give me my camera ! - Shut the fuck up . Hey , wait a minute ! I got my rights ! I 'm ajournalist . - Harrigan ! Harrigan ! - Shut up . Let 's go . Smells like a cover-up . The press has a right to know ! Take him out of the building . Search him . Now you get the hell out of here . Who the hell are you , Keyes ? The last person in the world you wanna fuck with . Wanna make me proud , kid ? Take your bag oftricks , stay with them , find out where they take her . Meet me later at La Cita 's . And be careful . These guys are good . Hey , don 't worry ! Surveillance is my specialty . OK , then . Just get going . ( chuckles ) Go get ' em , Lone Ranger . Danny , look here . We gotta take this real cool . These guys sure aren 't the DEA , but it 's still Keyes 's party . You stick around , stay out of sight . I 'll meet you at one o 'clock . We 'll take a good look at that room , OK ? Hey , wait for me . ( distorted ) Dannyboy , no hero stuff , understand ? ( echoing ) Dan-Dan-Dannyboy . ( Mike ) Watch your ass , Danny boy . ( # dance music ) ( Jerry ) She never made it . The feds were waiting . Hustled her off in a chopper . - Let me guess . A silver Alouette ? - That very one . And guess what . Your pal Keyes was running the whole show . And his butt boys . Son of a bitch . You done real good , kid . Now tomorrow , start a tail on Keyes . Everything he does , everywhere he goes . Who knows ? You mightjust get lucky . Lieutenant ! Luck ... .. is my specialty . Yeah . I bet it is . Now , if you 'll excuse me , Lieutenant , I got some serious police work to attend to . Come to Papa . Hey ! - Hey , are your balls OK ? - Fine . How are yours ? - Hey , do you mind ? It 's my sister . - Say what ? Oh , you 're not my sister . Son of a bitch . Who are you really chasing , Keyes ? Time to go to work . - Shit . - ( predator ) Dannyboy . Mike ? Whoa ! Whoa ! ( pants ) Oh , God ! No . No . Oh , God ! - ( Danny ) Oh , Mother of God ! - ( gunshots ) Please , no ! Oh ! Aargh !

Also responsible for the destruction of 11 patrol cars , a citybus ... What about ten commendations for valour ... .. and the best felony arrest record in the history of this department ? That and my intervention on your behalf are the only reasons you still have ajob . If it were up to the chief , he 'd charge you with Detective Archuleta 's death and suspend you . As it is , he left it in my hands . Now , this John Wayne attitude and flagrant disregard for policy is gonna end now . No one under my command will impede the progress of this federal task force ... .. headed by Agent Keyes . No one . That 's it . Dismissed . Mike , you 're too close to this . Stay out of it . It 's a police matter . They can 't keep the department out of it . We 'll find Danny 's killer . Captain , Danny and I came up together . 15 years on the fucking street ! Whoever killed him 's gonna pay . I 'm gonna finish it . Hey ! Hey , come on . What is this ? ( onlookers gasping ) Listen , shithead . I don 't give a fuck what you want with this asshole because now it 's personal . And he 's a dead man . What you 're dealing with is over your head . I 'm warning you ... You ! You don 't know what you 're dealing with . And I 'm warning you . Stay the fuck out ofmy way ! - I 'll take care of him . - No . Let him go . We 're too close .

The latest update on the scoreboard : .. five assorted trash and one good cop , ... .. one of the best on ourforce . Who 's next ? Where 's the mayor ? He 's not even in the city ... Forget it . It 's over . Mike , goddamn it . This ain 't your personal little war , you know . I loved Danny , too . Hey , you told me the only way you survive is because you 're a team . The door swings both ways . Remember ? All right . We 'll do it together . Come on . Talk to me about Keyes . - We 've been on him for the last three days . - And they 're not looking for drug dealers . Yeah . They 've been setting up weird radar sensors all over downtown . I used my whole repertory to keep up with them ! I had scanners on them , but they scrambled my shit up . They had equipment I can 't begin to touch . And then this morning ... - .. I lost ' em . - We lost them . - Where ? - Vernon and lndustry . - They disappeared ! - The slaughterhouse district ? Yeah , and in this heat , whoo ! I mean , BO and barbecue ! Whatever Keyes is looking for , he 's found it , or close to it . Leona , I want to meet with King Willie . Willie and I seem to have the same problem . - In the meantime , you come with me . - Mike , it 's impossible ! Just do it . Fuck ! ( FBI offcer ) Omega 1 . This is Control . This is Omega 1 .

All units , you have approximately20 minutes to finish your task . - Roger . - Increase this UV . Up 42 per cent . ( woman ) Your friend died as the result of an intrusion in the chest cavity ... .. by an edged weapon that nearly cleaved the heart in two . Death was instantaneous . He was boned like a fish . I 've never seen anything like this . Please , do not touch anything . ( glass breaks ) Doctor , what about the other victims ? Anything there ? The federal team brought in their own forensic examiners . I am the medical examiner and the chief pathologist in the city , ... .. and they 've cut me out . Any way you can get a look at evidence the feds have collected ? - I mean , they must have run tests . - It won 't be easy . Doctor , ... .. l pried this from Danny 's hands . This is what took him into the rafters . - It has almost no weight . - But it cuts like steel . Let me see . We are now at 150,000 times normal magnification . Astonishing . This material doesn 't correspond to anything on the periodic table . - Lieutenant , what the hell is that thing ? - Don 't know . It 's not from a hardware store . - Military ? - Uh , good guess . Either something that got away , or something they want . Keyes . Ah , we 're getting closer now to what happened ... Hey , no ! ( Mike ) Easy , kid . Put your gun away . King Willie will see you now . ( rap music from carradio ) # I 'm tired of the ratrace , I wanna have fun ... - It 's OK . - Don 't you want me with you ?

I think you know who he is . - ( King Willie laughs ) - I wanthim . I don 't know who he is . But I know where he is . - The other side . - What are you talking about ? The spirit world , man . You see , ... .. it 's always the same . There 's no stopping what can 't be stopped . No killing what can 't be killed . Hey , make sense , man . This thing that 's killing your people and mine ... .. is from the other side . I can feel him all around . You can 't see the eyes of the demon ... .. until him come calling . This is dread , man . Truly dread . Nothing else for you here , policeman . Time to go . Prepare yourself . ( snarling ) " His foundation lie in the holy mountain . " " Selah . " Aargh !

Bodies strung out , ... .. bodies with the skins ripped off , the hearts torn from the cadavers . And just recently , King Willie , the drug lord , ... .. the vicious drug lord found in an alley just around the corner ... .. with his head cut off and his spinal column torn from the body . A fitting demise to the Prince of Powder . ( Leona ) FirstDanny , then King Willie . Andyou were right there ! He 's playing with you , Mike . You 've gotta be careful . Yeah . We all gotta be careful . What about Keyes ? - ( Mike ) Anything there ? - Definitelysomething slipperyabout Keyes . Seems there 's a Peter J Keyes . PhD physical sciences , Cornell . ( Jerry ) Hot out ofcollege andinto the Strategic Defense Institute . Then two years later commissioned as a captain in Air Force lntelligence . Mike , this is a dead end . We 're way out of our league ! Look , I don 't care who 's involved . This guy killed Danny and he 's going to fall ! - Whatabout the good doctor ? - I 'm here , Lieutenant . The federal authorities erased everything from the computer file except for this : .. part of a chemical test on a fragment ofwood from the penthouse . And it contained traces ... .. ofcattle bloodandheavy traces ofsteroids . I believe whoever killed Detective Archuleta had recently been in a slaughterhouse . ( Jerry ) That 's where llostKeyes the first time ! Yeah . That 's where we 'll find him . Take the metro . I 'll pick you up at Vernon station in an hour . Justbecause you don 'tsee Keyes 's boys doesn 'tmean they 're notaround . I just want you to stay in the car . OK ? Your mom and I won 't be very long . You sit still . We 'll be back in a few minutes . All right ? - Come on , honey . - Yes , darling . - Which way was it ? - Down here . ( imitates gunfire ) Take that , you scum-sucking dog .

Don 't you show up in the damnedest places . Come here , Lieutenant . I got something you might find interesting . What is this ? How many times do I have to tell you ? You don 't know what you 're dealing with . There 's your killer . Wonderful , isn 't it ? Pheromone signature left by his body . Scent molecules . Punch up three . Ten years ago one of his kind eliminated an elite Special Forces crew in Central America . There were two survivors . They indicated that , when trapped , the creature activated a self-destruct device ... .. that destroyed enough rainforest to cover 300 city blocks . Remarkable weaponry . That 's right , Lieutenant . Other-world life forms . Huh ? A fucking alien ! Iwo Jima , Cambodia , Beirut . Drawn by heat and conflict . He 's on safari . Lions . The tigers . The bears . Oh , my ! Trophies . That 's the game , isn 't it , Keyes ? You 're the lion . This is his jungle . - So why can 't we see him ? - Defensive adaptations are astounding . It 's somehow able to bend light . Perfect camouflage . - You admire the son of a bitch . - Not what he does . For what he is . For what he can give us . A new era of scientific technology . I 've waited a lifetime for this , and I 'm not going to miss the chance . ( beeping ) We have something on the pheromone scanners . - Target one is on the roof . - It 's taken us two weeks to learn his patterns .

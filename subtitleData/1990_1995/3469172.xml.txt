 Mm-hmm ! That was so good . I could live on chocolate . Chocolate brownies . Chocolate ice cream with those chocolate chunks . Double chocolate fudge cake covered with chocolate sauce . - Is she okay ? - Chocolate fix . Give her room . - Hello , Wyatt . - Miss Wellman , hi . - I really enjoyed class today . - Hmm . Who 's that ? Rhonda Wellman , Wyatt 's english teacher . - He 's got an obsession . - I 'm not obsessed . I just think about her all the time . Write notes to her I never send and follow her home now and them . - She seems uptight . - But I bet she was first in her class at librarian school . Go ahead , laugh . She 's really very warm and sensitive . And you should see the way she deconstructs melville . You 're getting me all hot . Wait a minute . See that girl over there ? I know her . That 's Julia what 's-her-name ... Putnam . We went to summer camp together eight years ago . I had a big crush on her . Man , she looks good . Julia ? Remember me ? Gary Wallace from Camp Hi-de-ho . Gary Wallace ? Oh , my God ! How are you ? This is bizarre . Was thinking about camp the other day . This is strange running into each other . You 're looking great . Oh , thanks . You are too . You always were the cutest kid at camp . - I was cute ? - Oh , yeah . I guess it 's okay to tell you this now but when we were going to camp I had the biggest crush on you . Too bad you didn 't try harder . - Hi , honey . - Hi . - Jeremy Scanlon ? - Do I know you ? - Hey , you remember Gary Wallace . - From Camp Hackamack ! - Hi-de-ho . - Gary , what 's up ? This is so weird because we were talking about camp the other day . I 'm surprised you recognize me without you fist in my face . I 'm sorry about that . - I was a real jerk back then . - [ Beeping ] I 'm going to be late for student council . It was great seeing you . Have a fine day . - I 'll get the car . - Okay . - You two are going together ? - Since eighth grade . What can I say ? I 'm a sucker for quarterbacks . - He 's a quarterback ? - And class president , editor of the paper honor roll- - the whole bit . So what are you doing these days ? I passed my geography quiz . [ Moaning ] This is your own fault . Next time , you 'll think twice before scarfing 16 slices of chocolate cake . 17 . I snuck when you dropped your fork . [ Belches ] All better . I can 't believe she 's going out with Scanlon . I mean did you hear him ? " You look great , Gary . " " Good seeing you , Gary . " Yeah , what a jerk . Good thing he left before he bought you lunch . What did Scanlon do to you that was so terrible ? He sent me ... the note . Not ... the note . [ Thunder ] - Very funny . - Sorry , Gary . Tell us about the note . All summer I was madly in love with Julia . And then one day , I get this note from her . Or so I thought . And the note said meet her but the big tree . I go there thinking this is my big chance . - But it 's a trap . - Scanlon set you up . I spent the night tied up to a tree wearing - nothing but a sock . - A sock ? I was humiliated . I became the phantom of Camp Hi-de-ho . Living from canoe to canoe all summer . I never got up the guts to ask Julia out . That 's so sad . Okay , I made the canoe part up , but it was pretty pathetic . It 's behind you now , so let it go . You can 't change the past . Oh , no ! Please forget I said that . Lise , is there a way to change the past ? That one summer 's haunted me for eight years . If I could do it over again , it would mean so much to me . Well , I could send you back in time to summer camp . Find the eight-years-old Gary Wallace . Give him enough courage to ask Julia out . And get even with Scanlon ? I 'm liking it . - Wy ? - As long as we don 't travel through time naked like the Terminator . Last one there is a rotten egg . Welcome to Hell . There 's the rec hall , arts and crafts canoes ... And there 's Julia . And that 's me . - Hey , Wallace , want a mud pie ? - Sure . And I 'm guessing that 's Scanlon . Time to rewrite history . Come on , Scanlon , you dink . I 'd like see you try that again . Come on , you cootie-head . I bet your mom has cooties too . I bet your whole family has cooties . We should call you the cootie-head . I remember this , and it 's not pretty . - What did you call me , Pippi ? - Hey , Scanlon ! Leave him alone . - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm your worst nightmare- - a counselor who 'll pay you back for all the little guys you stepped on . Let him down . Made you blink . [ Chattering ] : Counselor 's a wussy . Counselor 's a wussy . Am not ! - I hate him . - I hate him . Forgot about that . Get lost , you dork . Thanks for nothing . Jeez ! What crawled up my butt . I 'm going to go talk to myself . Later . So , what do you want to do first- - finger-paint ? Weave place mats ? Ooh ! A potter 's wheel ! We can make ashtrays . Hey , can I get some help over here ? Ms Wellman ? That 's my mom 's name . Call me Rhonda . Ms. Wellman was a counselor here ? Did you do this ? No . It 's just coincidence , I swear . WYATT : She was even cuter then . I just figured out how I 'm going to spend my summer . I am hot for teacher . She 's going to grow up to be your english teacher . It 's eight years from now . What can happen ? Hey ... you 're missing all the fun . How come you 're inside ? I 'm a big , fat loser . Somebody stole my snickerdoodles . No . You hid them under your mattress , remember ? That 's right . How 'd you know ? I 'm not just a camp counselor . I know all about you , because ... I 'm your future self come back in time to help you . - Help ! Help ! - Shh ! I can prove I 'm you . Your middle name is Walter . - It 's on my shirts . - Your favorite movie is Batman . - Batman 's a stinky old TV show . - It 's going to be a huge movie . Yeah , right . Last summer you tuked in you sock drawer - and blamed it on the dog . - You are for real . How come I haven 't seen you around Hi-de-ho before ? They just sent me up from counselor training school . We studied all the basics- - how to make pot holders , advance " capture the flag " intensive macaroni collage . - Hardy , har , har . - Seriously , I just started this week . I thought it might be a cool way to gain some teaching experience . I kind of have this dream to teach high school english someday and I love to read . Herman Melville 's my favorite Author but you probably don 't like any of that stuff . You can say that again . I hate to read . - You do ? - My dad 's a professor . He 's always making me read . He 's really strict . This is the first time I 've been away from home by myself . - Really ? - Yeah . I guess he 's afraid I 'll meet a boy . - You know , I 'm a boy . - No ? ! Aw , come on . Cheer up . I 'm sorry . I felt I had to tell you . But I love wham . They can 't break up . These things happen . What other bad things happen ? Is our whole life this sucky ? I know this summer bites , but it gets better . There 's something that 's going to make this summer killer . It 's about a girl you like , so don 't freak-out , okay ? I don 't freak-out over girls . - Hi . Where 's your little buddy ? - Freaking-out . Gary ? It 's okay . This is Lisa . In the future we hang out together . Really ? Now , how 'd a dweeb like you land a babe like her ? - He made me . - Good work , my friend . - [ Laughing ] - Have you told him yet ? - Told me what ? - Julia Putnum has a big crush on you . - Sure . Right . - No . I 'm telling you she does . - She wants your bod . - I don 't believe you . See that ? She just smiled right at us . I saw her first , okay ? So just back off . You don 't understand . I 'm here to help you . I don 't like her now . I liked her then . - When ? - Now . My head hurts . Look . Julia is way into you . It 's a sure thing . She 's just waiting for you to ask her to be your girlfriend . - I don 't think so . - Look , just talk to her . - Hi , Julia . - Hi , Gary . - You like camp so far ? - It 's okay . - Yeah . - I made a key ring for my mom . I made a bottle opener for my dad . Well , maybe I 'll see you around . Okay . - So , how 'd it go ? - I didn 't puke . I make me so proud . You make me crazy when you call me " teacher " . - Sorry about that . - No . I like it . " Teacher . " Lisa , what 's the future like ? Can cars fly ? No , but we 've got fat-free cheese . Little " G " , you know what you 're going to do . Tomorrow night you 're going to show up at Julia 's cabin with flowers , and ask her to the camp cookout , right ? [ Knocking ] Hey , look . It 's a note . Oh , my God ! The note ! I forgot about the note ! It 's from Julia . She says she wants to meet me . It 's a trick . Scanlon wrote it . - She does like me . - It 's a set-up ! - The paper even smells like her . - Are you even listening ? - I 'm coming , Julia ! - Wait , you pinhead It 's a trap . Lisa , please , you got to help me . Scanlon is going to string me up and slap a sock on me . You got to turn this around . You 're asking me to use my magic to humiliate an eight-year-old child ? He 's almost nine . Besides , he deserves this . It 's been eight years . Let it go . That 's why I came back . I thought you came to help little Gary get Julia . Sure , that 's part of it , but I 'd love to nail Scanlon . Okay . It 's done . Go admire your handiwork but then , can we get out of here ? SCANLON : Somebody untie me . Hey , what 's going on here ? - Come on . Let me go . - Looks like your little plan backfired . Maybe next time you 'll think twice before you mess with Gary Walter Wallace- - cootie-head . - I got your note . - Huh ? - Want to take a walk or something ? - Okay . I think my work here is done . The look on Scanlon 's face- - It was perfect . I 've been waiting for that moment my whole life . I hope going back didn 't somehow mess up the present . One small change in the past could trigger huge changes in the present my life feels the same . Yeah , everything looks the same to me . - What ? - Uh ... Uh-uh , he 'll freak . So , how did everything go witrh your 16-year-old english teacher ? Great . Just sorry I didn 't have a chance to say good-bye . - Just as well . - Hi , Gary . - Hey , guys . - Julia . I told Jim and Molly we 're going to bag on tonight . Do you want to catch a movie instead ? Sure , a movie 's good . A little time alone with my girlfriend Julia . Oops . Sorry , Julia . Mop-top . - Barbie . - Oh ... - Is that Scanlon ? - What a jerk . Really ? You think so ? High school dropout . Hardly ever bathes . I 'd say he gets the local loser award . See you tonight . Oops. now look what I 've gone and done . His life 's a mess . You 've ruined his life . He used to be star athlete and an honor student . Guys like Scanlon are all the same- - good looking , arrogant . They think they can do anything they want . He deserves whatever he gets . Got . Was going to be getting . - Ms. Wellman ? - Wyatt , come on in . What can I do for you ? I wanted to talk to you about my writing assignment . I was thinking about my first dating experience . I 'm having a little troubled getting started though . Do you have any specially fond memories of your first boyfriend ? My first boyfriend . Yes , I do . I have very fond memories of him . Derek . We met when we were seniors in high school . No , no , no . Before that . Do you have any memorable , say , summer romances ? Lots of them , sure . There was Vince , Joe , Dominic , James , Patrick . And there was this one boy from Camp Wackadoo . - Hi-de-ho . - He was my first kiss- - So sweet , so tender . We were together only a short time but the brevity of our romance was matched only but its passion . He disappeared without ever saying farewell . Pity . I was willing to give my whole self over to him . - You mean ... ? - Yes , I was his for the taking . - [ Whimpers ] - It 's just as well . Neither of us were prepared to handle that kind of responsibility . You kind of remind me of him , Wyatt . Except he had black hair . Ah ! What twisted wrinkle in time did this ? - You care to explain ? - You 're traveling through time . There are hazards . A follicle discoloration happens to be one of them . But blonde ? See you then , okay ? Bye . Julia . Oh , guess what ? My folks are going out tonight . I thought we could rent a movie , and I don 't know- - do what boyfriends and girlfriends do . Wait , Gary . I want to say something . Shoot . We 've been together for a long time . Now that I know you , it 's time we moved on to the next step in our relationship . - Sex ? - Seeing other people . - What kind of step is that ? - The right one . I 'm sorry , Gary . We 've outgrown each other . You 'll divvy up your time between me and everybody else ? Nope . Julia ... - I 've lost my Julia . - You can 't be that bummed . Technically you barely knew her . It 's the principle of the thing . I was supposed to get her . That 's why we changed the past . Changing the past doesn 't matter if you weren 't meant to be with her . You meddled with time and all you did was ruin - Jeremy Scanlon 's life . - I refuse to feel guilty . Scanlon didn 't feel guilty for ruining my life . Gary , look at this . This is what Scanlon use to be . Gary , it was great seeing you . Have a fine day . This is what Scanlon is now . If you don 't reverse what you 've done , this is what he 'll become . You know what you have to do . You got to send me back in time to yesterday so I can dump Julia before she dumps me . - Gary . - I know . I got to go back and fix everything let him get the girl and tie me naked to a tree . - That 's a great idea . - What ? I mean the going-back part . I 'll go with you . It 's okay . You don 't have to come . No , no , no , I insist . We can spend the night . - You 're a true friend , Wyatt . - Yeah . I want to be there for you . Just give me two minutes . I want to slap on some cologne . What a guy . You have no idea what 's going on , do you ? I don 't understand . She said she loved me . - Poor , little guy . - Don 't worry . I 'll get over it . I can 't imagine anything more humiliating . - I can . - I 'm off to met Rhonda . Wish me luck . How do I look ? Uh ... you smell great . Captioned by Grantman Brown

You 're still here man ... what , the secret service job didn 't come through eh ? - A real bummer , man They did a check on me and found out that I knew you . - So , what are we here for Willy ? Well , the cell walls of his stomach have been eaten away by something corrosive . Enzymes probably ... But there not like anything I 've ever seen before . Maybe he was into new drugs . You know , strictly experimental stuff . Now , it could be a hybrid from any of those crazy psycho-pharmaceuticals like Pemalin , Euphoria , Beana , Vasupression . or maybe he was just sniffing xxxxxx . It looks like a ... 9 . - Paul Mathews . - Well , he was one healthy dude . Unnaturally healthy . Now I 'm talking new drugs here right . Not your 70s designer shit or your 80s ghetto-powders . I 'm talking the 90s man . Cognition enhancers . Designed to take your mind into new " intraphenomenalogical " dimensions . Kate ? You are the last one . I have collected 12 others . This has been my quest . 13 male ribs . When I chose you at the airport . I became an image of your deepest fears . I am now your darkest fantasy . There are many women in the world like me . And there are many men in the world like you . And we are all ... in ... your mind . - Oh , hello . God , what a dickhead . - I had another one of those dreams . Maybe my body is trying to tell me something . - Yeah you 're pregnant . Morning . Detective Philips , CIB . - Just wanted to ask you a few questions about the accident here the other day . - Yes , awful wasn 't it ? - Do you know Mr. Mathews over at number 9 ? - Oh , we 've only just shifted here . This week as a matter of fact . Me and Brian , he 's my husband . We haven 't met anyone else in the court yet . No welcoming commitee eh ? Well , if you do happen to see anybody over at number 9 . Could you give us a call on that number . Thanks . Oh and ... - congratulations ! - Thanks . - So how is the new house ? - Oh , it 's ok . I didn 't sleep too well last night though . Strange bedroom . You 'll get used to it . It could also be the infant . Its protein intake is at its highest at the moment . Particularly at night . Up until their birth babies are the ultimate parasite . - But everything is under control so don 't you worry . I 'll see you the same time next week . - See you then . See ya , bye . - Are you alone ? - Yes , doctor . We have to decrease Cheryl Rand 's dosage . - But that will invalidate the results . - We can 't help that . The patient 's overreacting . - I suppose you 're going to ask for further re-testing . - We have no other choice . But we can 't turn back ! We have to change our strategy , my girl . Ever since your boyfriend foamed at the mouth and kamikaze 'd into Pebbles Court we have to rethink our position . - How was I supposed to know he could handle that dose ? - Well , don 't you see that is the problem ? The drug is still too unpredictable . But I have set up an exclusive dealership with one of the largest chain stores in this country . - If we delay deliver of the first ... - Fuck the chain store . What about the cops ! Something is wrong . Your boyfriend underreacted , Cheryl Rand is overreacting . What about the two Italian kids ? Have they turned up for their hormonal research yet ? They haven 't , have they ? But we can run simutaneous sperm tests on the Noble family - without holding the Cheryl Rand experiment . - Do not question me , Shaan . If this thing goes wrong it will be worse than Thalidomide . Beauville ! - We 're shipping the tablets this evening . - But that 's way ahead of schedule . Dr. Carrera ... - Dr. Carrera is in charge of in field placement . I 'm handling consignment and distribution . - I thought the Doc was in charge of C D. We must change our strategy , my boy . We do as I say . Don 't you ever hang up on me again . But we haven 't spoken for so long . Sounds like we 're in business again . You know where to find me , Crackers . Hi , you must be our new neighbour . - I 'm Thompson Noble and I 'm Angelica . - Cheryl . Oh kids , say hello . This is Eloise my eldest and that little brat is Brandon . - Can we get a move on ! Nice to meet you all . When you get back you can come over and meet Brian , my husband . - So where are you going ? - Oh , it 's a special secret . A holiday we 'll never forget . - Bye . - Bye . Cheryl , it 's doctor Carrera , Cheryl . Doctor Carrera ... I think ... I think ... Can you drop your placenta one month prior to birth . No , don 't think that 's possible . You see ... - Doctor Carrera , Can you come over , now ? - I 'm on my way . Brian , Doctor Carrera . Can you meet me at your place right away ? No , no , no . Everything is alright . I 'll explain when we get there . Now , there is nothing to worry about . Cheryl ! I never would have expected him to be capable of such a thing . Murder weapon is covered in fingerprints . Probably his . - Do you have any other patients in this court , doctor ? - Why ? Do you know a Mr. Paul Mathews ? Uh .. Mathews ? No . - Over at number 9 - Why do you suspect him of doing this ? We had a bad accident here the other day . We have reason to suspect the victim was on his way to see Paul Mathews . Doctor . Do you know of a viral disease that in its first phase has hallucinogenic delusions . Well , yes . There are many of them . And in its second phase , glandular complications . Most viruses initially affect cerebral perception in one way or another . Dizziness , vertigo , tunnel vision . Was Cheryl Rand taking any kind of special medication ? No ... Not to my knowledge . It 'll show up in the poor woman 's autopsy I guess . - Welcome to Vimuville , I 'm Shaan . - Hello , I 'm Mr. Noble . This is my wife ... Alright ! - Demitra ! - Folks , meet my tireless assistant Demitra . - Hi . - Any problems , she 's yours for the asking . Gotta zap . I 'll meet you back at reception in an hour and I 'll give you your daily fitness programs . Dig in ! All the food you see here is of the same mega-nutritional value . Designed to appeal to both adults and children alike . - You know how it is , positive deception . - Now , why hasn 't anyone thought of that before . - Excuse me . - Yes . - This place sucks , ya know - You 're so perceptive , Brandon ! - A bit of the PMT , eh sis ? * Pre-Menstrual Tension ( PMT ) - Fuck off , wiener dick . You bet I 'm gonna fuck off . Tonight I 'll sleep under the stars . You 're such a He-man , Brandon . At least I don 't let mum tell me what to wear . I hope you break your neck ! Ladies and gentlemen . This one will be over the fucking top ! Sweetie , Are you sure about Brandon . Don 't worry ... I saw him smuggle his tent in with his luggage . He 's camping outside tonight . Got a real gem for your Pebbles Court collection . And check this out . - Holy ear-ache ! - And for the grand finale . Hello ? I 've stored the Noble 's urine samples . Can me and Beau have some more vitties ? ( vitamins ) - So , what happened to your last supply . - Phase V2s ? They 're piss weak ! - How about ... some Forte-4s ? - Forget it ! You 'll have to wait until your next scheduled ration . Homesville , Pebbles Court . Noble family , urine analysis . Hello , I 'm not here just now . Make it short and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . Don 't hit the roof when you see this data . I know we can push ahead with some further tests on the Nobles tomorrow . The urine looks really good . Yanta-fucking-bulla ! Your friendly health farm hostess . Get a chopper . Now . Just what the doctor ordered . - Did you seen Angelica 's split ends ? - I 'd rather see your split end . Beau , this is getting a little out of hand . We haven 't even had breakfast yet . - But I 'm not hungry . Oh , yes I am ... - Beau , stop it ! Stop it ! I 'm going to the Bistro to have some breakfast . You should take a cold shower . So , still into driving a Merc are we , Crackers ? Don 't forget that your advanced hearing is the result of my chemical breakthroughs Pud . At least I had the guts to experiment with the drugs on myself . That is what partnerships are all about . So ... How 's it going , Crackers ? Done any good drugs , lately ? You know what I want . What is this ? Well , when we parted company I made sure I took a little something from the lab . I knew you 'd give your master plan a second shot . You see , without that little additive the body can 't control it 's new powers . It might even ... explode . Very fucking messy . It 's all falling apart , eh Crackers ! All us people of Vimuville . You and your mega-bugs ! You fucking Bob Geldof of the xxxxxx You were wrong then ! And I 'll make sure you 're wrong now ! I love it ! I need it ! Yeah ! It 's a power machine . Alright , hold tight . I 'm a highway star ! Thomps ? - You alright ? - It 's alright . Nothing to worry about . Thomps ? Eloise ! - Shaan ! - Quick mum needs help something 's wrong with dad . Vimuville , the best place in the world for your body . Quick in the car ! - Oh , my god ! - No ! This must be the place . Quick get the doctor . We have to see the doctor immediately . - I 'm sorry , you 're going to have to take ... - Don 't give me that shit just get the doctor . You 've got to come up to Vimuville . Something terrible has happened . Vimuville ? What are you doing up at that old chemical dump . I haven 't been there since it was closed by the health commission . That must be over 20 years ago . The food . The food they 've all eaten it ! Why don 't you just come into the surgery and we 'll ... Yes , madame , I 'm listening ... The human body . At best ... a neglected engine running on cheap fuel . The way I see it Doc , you 're running on empty . You would not have the faintest idea ... of what your body could do . If it had the right formula . But without that ' fuel ' . You are nothing . A zero . Finished Doctor Carrera ? No , not quite Detective Philips . Don 't even think about it . 645 to airborne 19 , Is Sam still with you ? - Yep , still here . - We 've put a quarantine on Pebbles Court but Sam ... - Yeah ? - That fucking freak has been chucking up for the last 20 minutes . It 's wall to wall shit all over the place . Now look , we 've finally caught him in your office Sam . Now the only trouble is that young Jordan is trapped in there with him . - In my office ? - Keep those corridors covered . Move it ! Keep down ! Keep down ! Just keep those corridors covered ! Keep them covered ! Fuck-a-duck . Quick John , now ! John , now . Come on ! Sam over here . Keep away from the door ! What the fuck is wrong with this guy ? Is he sick or infected or what ? Sarge ! Get me the fuck outta here ! Get the paramedics ! Get Willy up here now ! He 's got my fucking shirt on . Cognition enhancers eh Willie ? You should see the bodies coming down from that crazy bloody farm . You should see the new death certificates . Death by hyper-natural causes . I can 't help it . I love this fucking job . - Not feeling queasy are we Johnno ? - What would you suggest Willie ? I 'd suggest some aspirin Johnno . Sam ? Would you get me some aspirin please ? - Ah , catch that speed freak yet ? - Yeah , he bagged himself . Geez , that guy was one crazy asshole . And detergent Jesus ! Yean , that 's alright .

 - the name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years , I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now- - Well , let 's just say , " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - That 's drako . He 's our , um , chief executive Officer . And I 'm head of security and personnel . My wife says you 're looking for work , right ? - That 's right , Mr. Tamsin , sir . - " Tamsin " will do , Ross , my boy . - Yes , sir . I 'm a hard worker . - It takes more than that to make it in our business . You 've gotta have nerve . Not everyone gets a chance like this . And you wouldn 't , if you weren 't my wife 's cousin . - Actually , sir , I-I 'm her nephew . What exactly do you make here ? - Whatever 's in demand . Currently , 50 credit notes . Here , buy yourself something nice . Don 't worry . They 're totally indistinguishable from government issue . - You mean they 're counterfeit ? - Counterfeit ? It 's such a judgmental word . I prefer replicates . Ross , great rewards don 't come without great risks . You 're not afraid of taking chances , are ya ? - Well , no , sir , but-But this is illegal . - What 's the matter with you ? I thought you were looking for a way to make some real money . - Well , I am , but I guess I 'm not cut out for this kind of work . - This is a genuine opportunity I 'm offering you here . - Thanks , but I 'm sorry . - Well , suit yourself . - Police- - You 're under arrest ! Nobody move ! Nobody move ! Drop it ! - I didn 't do-I didn 't do anything . - Relax , kid- - Relax- - We know . We heard everything- - We need to get a statement from you , and then you 're free to go , okay ? - Sure . - All right , let 's go . Come on- - Move it out ! - Come on . Come on ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go- - Come on- - Come on- - Come on- - Come on ! Hurry it up , people- - Move it ! - What the- - oh ! Hey- - Hold on- - Hold on- - Hold on ! - What is it ? - Oh ! Oh ! - That felt like an earthquake ! - Brilliant , haldane . I 'm surprised you haven 't made detective already . - Huh- - I do know how to make the earth move . - You wish . - Okay , party 's over ! - Ugh ! - Cover ! - What the hell is that ? - I don 't know . We weren 't introduced . - cover me , Brogan ! - What is it shooting ? - Some kind of charged particle beam . - That small- - It can 't be . - Tell him that . - Move- - I 'll cover you . - Ugh . - Took ! Took ! - We 're not gonna stop him with these . - Well , maybe if we concentrate our fire and hit him from all angles at once . Everybody , on my signal , fire ! Now ! Flank him ! - Where is he goin ' ? - Get down , kid ! Get down ! - Ugh ! Ah ! - Hang in there , kid- - Hang in there . - Four officers down- - We need emergency medical assistance . - Her spine was shattered in two places- - An injury that would paralyze a human . Fortunately , she 's a tarn , and her spinal chord will regenerate . In a week , she 'll be as good as new . - that is , if you can hold still and give yourself a chance to heal . - Well , it 's times like this When telekinesis really comes in handy . - Well , look on the bright side , tooky . You got a week 's worth of " R " And " R , " While your partner does all the work . - Yeah , for a change . - Oh , I see- - All of a sudden , you 're an expert on work . - Well , I know how to get out of it . - Only you would take pride in that . - It 's good to see you two getting along so well . - Yes , right- - You just get well , before the captain gets any bright ideas of partnering me off with him . - Hmm , castle and , Well , haldane and castle-- - it 's got a nice ring to it . - Relax . I 'll be back on the streets , before you know it . Tarns are built tough , you know ? - As for your suspect- - - He 's not a suspect , doctor . He 's just somebody who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . - that 's an understatement . He 's in critical condition . We 've got him on full life support . - is he gonna pull through ? - Hard to say . He 's stable , for now , But , frankly , I 'm not optimistic . - Well , I 'm responsible for him being here . - It was nobody 's fault , Brogan . - I should 've called for more backup . - You had four units . - I should 've called for six or eight . I don 't know- - I should 've been prepared . - to what- - invade a small country- - Nonsense . There was nothing wrong with your plan or its execution . In fact , you all performed admirably . - Look , captain , please , don 't patronize me . I screwed up ! - I 'll tell you what you screwed up . Nobody expected drako to have some kind of killer cyborg waiting to spring him loose . Fine . Now , listen , my concern is not to find fault . My concern is to determine your next move . - We look for draco . We find him- - We find the cyborg . - that 's if the cyborg was under draco 's control . - You don 't think it was ? - I 'm not sure . Sophisticated weaponry is not the way draco normally operates . - So , maybe he changed his m.O. I mean , if this thing wasn 't draco 's , whose was it ? And why did it screw up our bust ? - I don 't know . - Right- - It 's time to find some answers . Have forensics run an analysis of this hunk of armor you managed to blast loose . Maybe we 'll get some leads from that . So , what 's your game plan ? - I figure , we hit the streets . Somebody 's gotta know somethin ' about that thing . - Yeah , that 's right . Assassins don 't just materialize out of thin air , huh ? - I 'm disappointed in you , zipload . - No reason , Brogan . I-I 'm being straight wit ' ya . I don 't know nothin ' about draco or-Or the cyborg killer . - I never lie to you , Brogan . - Of course not , Sara . But every now and then , you keep things from me . - Not this time- - I swear . I 'm keeping nothing from you . - You know , maybe a week in the joint would help to awaken your memory . - Oh , no- - Please . You know I can 't take that- - I-I 'm as good as dead there . I wouldn 't make it . - Then tell us what we wanna know . - I would , if I knew anything . But I swear , I haven 't heard a damn thing . - Hi . - Hi . - Have you eaten ? - Oh , I had a cup of coffee . - Now , there 's a nutritious dinner . - Yeah . - How 's tooky ? - Uh , she 's doing fine . - You tired ? - Yeah . Been pounding the streets all day- - Not a single lead . Mmm . - Okay , take off your jacket and show me . - Show you what ? - Whatever it is you 're keeping from me . - Ah . - Oh- - I 'll change the bandage . - It 's nothin ' . - It 's a blast wound , isn 't it ? - Uh , not exactly . - don 't get technical on me . - Ah ! - You , uh , didn 't get that playing golf . - I don 't know . You haven 't seen haldane 's back swing lately . - Is that a real wound , dad ? - Yeah . I 'm afraid it is . - You nail the perp ? - No , not yet- - I will . - Cool . - I don 't think so , zil . She wants to know if you 're gonna die . - Uh , no , sweetie , not from this little scratch . - Honey , your father 's fine . Tell zil not to worry about a thing . - She understands english , mom . - of course , she does- - Look , it 's late . It 's time to go to bed- - Kiss your dad good night . - hmm . - Good night , dad . - Good night , sweetie . - Code red . Officer needs assistance . Ah ! - Took 's dead . I keep saying it to myself over and over and over , again , 'cause part of me just won 't accept it . I can 't believe it . - Yeah , I , uh , I keep thinking that she 'll walk in any minute and Apologize for missing roll call . Look , Jane . I-I don 't know how to say this without-Without it sounding like a line , But if there 's anything I can do to help , I mean , an ear or a shoulder , anything , just let me know . - I will . - I know I 'm not exactly your first choice . But , well , the offer 's there , for what it 's worth . - Thanks . - The night duty nurse caught a glimpse of the assailant leaving the icu . Matches the description of the creature that attacked you at draco 's warehouse . - I don 't get it . Why would that thing wanna kill took ? Some kind of vendetta against cops ? - Uh , maybe . If draco 's pulling the cyborg 's strings , could be that draco is holding a grudge against us for busting the operation , huh ? - Captain , forensics have run every test they 've got on this hunk of armor . - Well ? - Well , sir , all the tests were inconclusive . - What do you mean , " inconclusive ? " - It 's some sort of bizarre alloy that defies description . They can 't tell what it 's made of . - don 't they have any idea ? - Well , they 're talking of sending it to the hawking laboratories on earth , but that ain 't cheap . - I 'll worry about that . Get it to them ! - Brogan , your friend zipload 's on comm six . - I 'll take it in the captain 's Office . - why don 't you use my office , Brogan ? - Zipload , what do you got- - Did you find the cyborg ? - Uh , no- - but I , uh , I might know where draco 's holed up . - I don 't have time for guessing games- - Come on . - Oh , hey- - Hey , Brogan ! I 'm going out on a limb here . A guy 's gotta live ! - Yeah , well , that 's gonna be kinda hard to do when word gets out you 're a police informant . - Oh . Oh , that 's cold , Brogan . All right . Draco 's got the penthouse suite at the torana hotel . - there 's his penthouse . - Well , it looks like draco 's not home . Oh , damn . - What ? You got a hot date ? - No , I just wanted to check on Jane . See if she 's all right . - that 's gonna have to wait , partner . Draco just got home . Oh ! - Oh , look . There 's a cyborg in that Hopper . All units- - All units- - Cyborg spotted . Grid reference b-Seven-Five , zone eight . He 's headed north out of the torana hotel . All available units converge . Let 's nail this cop killer . - Hang on . - What the hell ? - Uh ... control surfacers gone . We 're losing it- - Eject , haldane . Eject ! - Malfunction- - My ejector won 't work . - I 'll try and set ' er down . - What are you , nuts , without the surfacers ? Eject ! Punch out , Brogan ! - Not without you ! - End of discussion ! Happy landings , partner . - damn it , haldane ! - Is that coffee fresh ? - No more than usual . - I think I 'll have some , anyway . I need the wake-up call . - Tired ? - It 's not sleepy . It 's more like , uh- - - Numb . - that 's it . Nothing makes sense anymore . Took and haldane , both good cops , good people , gone . - I know . You keep Asking yourself why . And you know damn well there 's no reason . - haldane and I , we used to give each other such a rough time . You know something ? I always thought we 'd end up together . - hmm . - You 're not surprised ? - No . I always thought you would , too . What do you got , sergeant ? - Maybe a lead on tamsin , draco 's second in command . Someone called in an anonymous tip , an address where tamsin 's hiding out . I 'd put orrin and romek on it . They 're still checking out draco 's known enemies . - I 'll take it . - We 'll take it . - Okay , so both of you take it . - You know , Jane , if you wanna take a few days , give yourself some time . - I don 't see you taking any time . - I will later . Right now , I 've gotta keep focused on Tracking down haldane 's killer . - It 's dangerous to make this hunt personal . - I 'm not . - Good . Then there 's no reason for you to work alone on this . Do you think tamsin knows something about the cyborg ? - More than that . I think tamsin may be the one giving it orders . - So , we 're saying that the cyborg didn 't show up at the bust to save draco but to kill him ? - Brogan ? It 's me , tamsin- - We need to talk . - Show yourself . And put your hands where I can see them ! It 's all right- - don 't shoot ! I 'm surrendering . - So , you made the anonymous call yourself ? - What 's the matter , tamsin- - Your killer turn on ya ? - My killer- - No . I don 't know anything about that thing . It doesn 't work for me . - Right . - I don 't know what it does or who it is . All I know , is it killed draco . I demand protection ! - You can demand squat . If the cyborg 's after ya , that 's your problem . You hired it . - that 's not True . I 'm telling ya- - I don 't know anything about it ! - I 'm telling you- - You 're gonna pay for my partner 's death . And you wanna know something ? I 'd just as soon let the cyborg do the job . - You wouldn 't do that- - you can 't do that ! You-You 're a good cop- - You play by the rules ! - Not anymore . - ah ! If-If you leave me here , I 'm a dead man . - don 't beg for your life . It don 't mean a damn thing to me . The only thing you 've got to bargain with is the truth . Now , tell me about the cyborg ! - I don 't know anything about it . - Who is he- - Where can we find him ? - I swear- - I don 't know ! Ah ! - Brogan ! - Stay out of this ! - Now , where is he ? - Brogan , stop it . - Answer me . - Brogan , put that away . - Not till this punk talks to us . - He is talking- - You 're just not listening . - all I 'm hearing is lies- - I want the truth . - So do I , but this isn 't the way , and you know it . We have to do this right , by the book . Come on- - Let 's take him in . - What happened to you , tamsin- - You 're a mess . - Sideswiped by a sky cab . - Accidents happen . - Look , you just wanna book me and be quick about it ? And I 'm kind of in a hurry to be locked away inside a nice , safe cell , okay ? - We aim to please . - Brogan , take a look at this . - Terrific- - What the hell is it ? - The analysis of that piece of metal from the cyborg . We just got it from the hawking laboratories . - they say they 'd never seen anything like it . It 's platinum and iridium , mostly , plus rhodium , beryllium , thallium , and carbon . - Great- - So ? - So , they say they don 't know how an alloy of those elements , in this proportions , could ever have been made . - Well , someone did it . - Yeah , But the top metallurgists on earth swear they couldn 't even begin to duplicate this stuff . They wouldn 't know where to start . - Brogan , dr . Grant just called from the hospital . She wants to speak to you in person . - I can 't explain it , lieutenant , but his condition is improving . He 's still comatose , but his heart rate stabilized , and his tissue degeneration has stopped . And you don 't know the cause ? We think we know the cause , but we still can 't figure it out . Uh , we found an unusual substance in Ross ' bloodstream . From the absorption rate , we estimate it was given to him about 39 hours ago . - that 's when the cyborg broke in here and killed took . - And the substance is actually helping Ross recover ? - The drug is limiting the amount of damage . Still , even if he regains consciousness , he 'll most likely be paralyzed for life . - Have you analyzed the drug ? - Thoroughly , but , well , uh- - - It 's a compound you 've never seen before . Too complex for you to synthesize ? - Well , that 's right . Even given the formula , we couldn 't make that drug . The technology doesn 't exist yet . - I don 't get it . Why would that monster give Ross a drug that would help him ? - So , we 've got a cyborg with weapons No one can identify . - Armored with a metal no one can make . - And giving Ross a drug that no one can synthesize because the technology doesn 't exist yet . What if he 's from the future ? - a time traveler ? - It would explain a lot of things , don 't you think ? - I think you 've got a hell of an imagination . Frankly , I don 't care where it came from . We know it 's a cop killer . The only other thing I wanna know about it is how to take it down . - Where is tamsin ? - Oh ! - Ah ! - Ah ! - What 's going on here ? Ah ! - All units proceed to precinct eight-eight . Code Three . We 're under attack ! Ah ! - Intruder alert- - Intruder alert . Security breach- - Intruder alert . Security breach . - Ah ! - Oh , my god . - the cyborg . - It 's heading for the cells . Lookin ' for tamsin . I 'm all right . Go- - go ! - No , sir- - It 's all clear around here . - Are you sure ? - Yeah , we checked everywhere . Hey ! - Don 't kill me ! Ah ! Don 't kill me- - Ah ! - Stay back , Brogan ! - Oh- - I 'll be back for you , Brogan . You created me , and you 're gonna die for it . - I don 't wanna go , dad . - It 's not up for debate . - But I wanna stay here with you . - No- - Now , listen to me . Listen to me . I need you to be with your mother and sister , all right ? - Right . - Thank you . - Mom , I 'm scared , and so is zil . - Sweetie , don 't be afraid . We 're going to a safe place . - Why do we have to go ? - Because it isn 't okay to be here now . - Then how come daddy 's staying ? - Because he has to- - It 's his job . - I 'll be with you soon , sweetie- - don 't worry about it . - No , we 're not taking the bat . Come on- - Here , take my briefcase- - Please ? It 's heavy- - It 's heavy . Please- - Let 's go . - Come here . Don 't call or try to contact me . Don 't discuss with anyone where you 're going . - I know the drill . We 'll be fine . - It 's gonna be all right . - No . No , it won 't be all right . Because even if you make it through this , you 've crossed a line . We can 't go back to the way things were before . - Sure , we can . - I can 't . I 'm sorry . Okay , everybody- - Let 's go- - Let 's go . - Come on . Come on . - ugh ! - Ah ! Ah ! Ah . - Too bad your trap won 't work without power , Brogan . - that wasn 't the trap . Ah ! Ah- - Ugh . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Now , let 's see who you are . Ah ! Ross ? - That 's right , Brogan . The boy you crippled , now a man . - Jane was right- - You are a time traveler . - From 30 years in the future . I did come out of the coma , when cybernetic techniques were developed that gave me this artificial body . - They give you your murder weapons , too ? - I added those- - and when I found a scientist who had invented a means of time travel , I stole his prototype and came back here to prevent the catastrophe that made me a cripple . - Yeah , well , you failed , pal- - You didn 't change history ! - I did , but not enough . In the original timeline , one of draco 's men fired the shot that knocked me into the acid bath . - The third technician , the first man you killed . - Yes . I stopped him from injuring me , but it made no difference . This time , it was your shot that put me in the acid . You crippled me ! I swore revenge on all of you . - You 've had about all the revenge you 're gonna get . Now , it 's my turn . - I 'm dying anyway . Go ahead and finish me . - No problem . But that wouldn 't bring anybody back . This time travel device , where is it ? - Why ? - Because this timeline has to be set right . - I haven 't got enough strength to make another time trip . - there 's another way . Let me go back . - You can 't undo the past . I 've already tried . - What have we got to lose ? - Nothing . The device is built into this belt . The calibration 's locked into the exact time coordinates . When the indicator comes on , just press that . - When I get there , I 'm gonna have to stop you from interfering . - use one of these power packs . They contain enough of a charge to disable me . Brogan ? Good luck . - I didn 't do- - I didn 't do anything . - Relax , kid- - Relax- - We know . We heard everything- - We need to get a statement from you , and then you 're free to go , okay ? - Sure . - All right , let 's go . Come on- - Move it out ! - Ross ! You , in the back , drop it ! - You heard the man- - Drop it ! - Good eyes , Brogan . - I didn 't say anything . - Well , it sure sounded like you . - Yeah , well , it wasn 't . Um , must 've come from outside . I 'll go check it out . - You 've ruined my mission . - No , the future has been changed . We 're ceasing to exist . We 've accomplished your mission . - What was it ? - I 'm not sure . For a minute , I thought I saw myself . - You 're drinking too much coffee . You 're starting to hallucinate . - Maybe you 're right . Everything okay in there ? - Yeah , a clean bust , smooth as space . You know , it 's nice when everything goes as planned , huh ? - Yeah . It sure is . - Nice and easy , everybody . Let 's go . - um , I , uh , need you to come up to the station with me and give a statement . It shouldn 't take too long . - Oh , that 's no problem . I 'm not in a hurry- - Thanks a lot . I 'm very grateful to you . - No , you did the hard part . You turned down tamsin 's offer . - Well , I said the words , but to be honest , I 'm not quite sure what I was really gonna do . I can 't say I wasn 't tempted . - Well , if there were a law against that , we 'd all be in trouble . - Yeah . - Excuse me . - Lieutenant , sergeant fredo informs me that you just busted draco 's operation with only four units . - Yes , sir . - What were you thinking of , Brogan ? - Captain ? - for a bust like that , you need a minimum of six or even eight units . - Uh , captain , I know what I 'm doing here . - Yeah , I suppose so . Well done , Brogan . - Thank you , sir . - ... so it couldn 't have been a earthquake , is what I 'm saying . - All I know , is if the ground moves , it 's an earthquake . - Technically speaking , that wasn 't an earthquake . - Okay , orrin . It was an altorquake . - Yeah . - So , what- - You guys are telling me none of you were even the least bit scared ? - I didn 't say that . I said only an idiot wouldn 't be scared . So , how about you , haldane ? - What about me ? - Were you scared or not ? - Is that a trick question ? - Hey , Brogan , what 's with the smile ? - I don 't know . For some reason , I was thinking that , um , we never really appreciate what we have until it 's gone . - Hey , now that 's profound . - If you ever quit the force , you should consider teaching philosophy . - Yeah , you could start writing greeting cards . I 'm sure you got a big future in that . - No , thanks . I 'll just stick with the future I 've got .

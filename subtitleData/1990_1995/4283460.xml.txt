 ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) Amazing . The last strawberry in the universe . Calibrator locked and set . Organic infrastructure recorded and stored . Engage the triplicator . - ( HISSES ) - It works ! - What works ? - We 've adapted the matter paddle . Now the returning signal is split three ways , so as well as receiving the original object , we get two identical copies . This will solve all our supply problems . Taking into account recalibration , we can produce four , perhaps even five strawberries a week . Well , if the Nobel Prize people run a fruit section , you 're this year 's hot tip . Gentlemen , history beckons . You 'll be famous . They 'll build statues , even name towns after you . " Dorksville " springs instantly to mind . - This machine could revolutionise our lives . - Absolutely . With this little baby , we could have a full fruit salad by the end of the year . Look , it 's not just strawberries . It can duplicate anything . It can ... Sir , what 's wrong ? This strawberry 's incredible ! So succulent . It 's divine . - Is that the same ? - Oh , no , no ! - How 's it different ? - It 's bitter , rancid . - Sir , I , um ... - Kind of tangy . - Sir , I ... - Crunchy . - Sir . - Tangy . Kind of chewy . Meaty , even . It 's a ... funny kind of wriggly texture . Oh , smeg ! It 's as if it extracted the best elements from one duplicate and the worst from the other . So what would happen if we reversed the process ? Nice experiment . What do you do for an encore ? Neutron bomb juggling ? - ( ALARM SOUNDS ) - Rude alert ! Rude alert ! An electrical fire has knocked out my voice recognition unicycle . Many Wurlitzers are missing from my database . Abandon shop ! This is not a daffodil ! This is not a daffodil . Well , thankfully , Holly 's unaffected . She 's right ! The engine core is approaching critical mass . Meltdown in 15 minutes ! A brisk stroll towards the cargo bay could be in order at this point . Red Dwarf 's gonna blow ? In less time than Norwegians take to buy ski boots . Hey , guys ! They 're playing the Awooga Waltz . Care to join me in a quickstep ? ( RIMMER ) Holly , open cargo bay doors . Er , Holly , those cargo bay doors we talked about earlier , would you mind opening them , please ? - Holly ! The doors , Holly ! - " Cargo bay doors " isn 't in my lexicon . - Manual override ! - " Manual override " isn 't ... Oh , forget it ! That 's eighty clicks . We should be clear of any possible blast zone . - You really think it 'll blow ? - This can 't be happening . Nothing 's gonna happen . We 're just here as a precaution . The whole ship 's full of fail-safes anyway - cooling systems , containment panels , vacuum shields ... The chances of it blowing are about one in ... .. one . Well , according to the charts , the nearest asteroid with an S-3 atmosphere is six hours away . But we only have enough fuel for five hours ' flight . I don 't think that 's a major problem , though , because we only have enough oxygen for seven minutes . ( MUTTERS ) Well , that doesn 't affect us , does it ? - ( MUTTERS ) Sorry , sir ? - We don 't need oxygen . Here 's a thought . If we ejected their corpses into outer space , would the weight reduction help us reach the asteroid ? - That 's not the attitude . - Sorry ? That 's not the Red Dwarf way . One in trouble , all in trouble . - The posse . - Boys from the Dwarf . - The homeboys always band together . - That 's the way it is . Have you got anything in writing ? You 're a toad , Rimmer . A weasel . You 're a slimy rodent with the morals of a praying mantis . I 'm just being a realist . You have seven minutes left to live . That 's tragic . God , it 's tragic ! - But for the rest of us , life must go on . - If I may interject , that 's not quite true . Remember , you are operating on emergency battery supplies . We have no spares . In fact , you yourself , sir , will expire in a little under four minutes . .. OK , homeboys , let 's posse ! - Right , Kryten , scan the wreckage . - Straight away , sir . Cat , get suited up . Maybe some oxygen tanks survived . Maybe some fuel tanks . If we get a fix , we bring them on-board . Meanwhile , turn Rimmer down to minimum power . It 'll triple his running time . Sirs , there 's something out there . Two objects , far too vast to be debris . According to the backlog , they materialised just before the explosion . - Can we get in any closer ? - Enhance maximum . ( COMPUTER WHIRRS ) ( KRYTEN ) Of course . Two copies of Red Dwarf . - How ? - Presumably , in reverse , the triplicator reversed the field of the beam , projecting it out , not in . So , instead of the strawberries , it copied the entire ship ? Precisely . Presumably , the resultant power drain caused the original to blow . So , like the strawberries , there are two new Red Dwarfs , one succulent and divine , - the other ... - Fish bait . So what 's the problem ? We got us a ship that 's better than the original . - Not quite . - In the lab , copies had a limited lifespan . - How limited ? - About an hour . There may be a solution . The ship 's contents should be triplicated too . There will be a working triplicator on-board whichever of the ships is superior . Theoretically , we can reverse the reversal and replicate the original Red Dwarf by amalgamating the two copies . He makes it sound so simple . We have to find a terminal to re-boost Mr Rimmer 's battery pack . We 'll catch you up . ( CELESTIAL MUSIC ) Check that music . It 's magnificent ! I never heard anything like it before . ( INHALES ) Ooh ! Get a lungful of that air , man ! Hmm ! Makes you feel good to be alive . Everything about this ship is ... well , it 's divine . Hey , let 's check the food . - What did you order ? - Ultimate test - Pot Noodle . ( BOTH ) Mmm ! I tell you this , I 've visited a parallel universe , seen time running backwards , played pool with planets and given birth to twins , but I never thought in my entire life I 'd taste an edible Pot Noodle . Brothers , we bid you welcome . There must be much you do not understand . Come . You 're me but you 're not me ... ? I am part of you , your higher self . I exist in you as potential . Now I 'm here , extrapolated from your being . Extrapo-what-alated ? Buddy , no way are you part of me . No part of me would be seen in sandals . I find clothes a distraction from the pursuit of spiritual and intellectual fulfilment . That 's weird - I find spiritual and intellectual fulfilment a distraction from the pursuit of clothes . Let us join our friends in the meditation chamber . We can spend the evening seeking answers to the metaphysical conundra that have always plagued mankind . - Sounds wild . - Hold me back . Philosophy , poetry , music and study . That is how we spend our time . Trying to expand our minds and unlock our full potential for humankind . What a pair of losers . Oh ! More visitors . Come , soul-sibling , let us prepare some refreshments . May your path lead to wisdom , and in wisdom know ye peace . These guys are part of us ? I don 't buy it . These are the people we could have become if all our negative aspects were removed . - You mean hippies ? - Sir , you think Jesus was a hippy . He was . Long hair , no job . What more do you want ? How come they 're smarter than us ? This is my guess - your mind records everything you see , hear , read , every conversation , it 's all stored in your subconscious . Somehow , our higher selves have access to that knowledge . Look , you got the gizmo , let 's scram before we 're roped into an evening of philosophy and self-flagellation . It 's not that simple . This triplicator has only half the vital components . We need the triplicator from the " low " ship . ( DING ! ) Let the entertainment begin . There will be haiku readings , poetry recitals and musings on the inner soul . But first , music and dance . Brother Rimmer is portraying agony . The agony of the soul searching out truth . The truth danced by Brother Cat . ( DING ! ) - But truth is elusive . - It flits like a firefly through the soul , teasing , confusing . And agony , in torment , searches forever in vain . - Brothers , I am compelled to intrude . - What is it , sister ? I am receiving a distress call from a ship which appears to be identical to our own . Then , we must help them . With haste , brothers . ( WHIRRS ) Approach pattern plotted . Let 's take her in nice and easy . Keep ' em peeled , guys . Welcome , brothers . We bring food and medical supplies . ( GUNSHOT ) Poor devil . His gun must have gone off accidentally . Welcome , my children . We bring you balms and tinctures . I come in peace to sing you healing hymns . - Is he dead ? - We can only hope . Oh ! The poor wretch ! He has a faulty gun . He accidentally shot me five times . Oh , how I love him ! Brother , there is a grievous fault with thine weapon . It keepeth shooting people . You see ? There it goes again . - What is this ? - A greeting gift . A sparkling welcome orb . Come , let us embrace its splendid beauty and share in its vibrations . It 's exquisite . What does it say to you , brother ? ( SNIGGERS ) ( GRUNTS AND SLURPS ) ( MANIC MUTTERING ) ( WHISPERS ) Rimmer ? Rimmer ? Rimmer ? Rimmer ? - Rimmer ? - Looking for someone ? Holy smeg ! Hello , my pretty . What do you want with me ? - I want to hurt you . - Why ? Because I 'm not a very nice person . A holo-whip . I 'm going to lash you to within an inch of your life . And then I 'm going to have you . ( LAUGHS ) ( ALL LAUGH SCORNFULLY ) ( LAUGHTER ECHOES ) Sirs , we have less than 20 minutes to find the second triplicator and set it up . I suggest we divide our efforts . - A sage suggestion , brother . - Perhaps I should go with Brother Cat ? - You haven 't got a weapon . - We have no need . We wear protective herbs . - I 'm going with Bot-Brain . - As you wish , brother . Thank you , friend . - It is ready . - Put it in his spine . ( SNIGGERS ) Wake up . You don 't want to miss the pain . Can you feel the needles as they burrow into your spine ? ( SNIGGERS ) You guys are two lettuces short of an allotment . - What are you after ? - Your vessel . - Nothing works here , man . - Everything is in decay . And here is how we 're going to get it . ( GRUNTING AND SNIGGERING ) - I can 't move . - Of course not . He hasn 't turned you on yet . - Show him . - ( SNIGGERS ) ( BLEEP ) ( BLEEP ) - He applauds our efforts . - Maybe he 'd like to go for a little walk . - Game over now , eh ? - I wonder what 's in that supply cabinet ? ( CRUNCH ) ( THEY CACKLE AND SNIGGER ) Oh , no ! No . ( LOW KRYTEN ) I wonder if he 'd like a drink to calm him down ? No ! ( CACKLING ) Whoops ! ( POT HISSES ) - Perhaps he 'd like something to eat . - ( THEY CACKLE ) Yes ! Oh ! You guys have got to be yanking my chain ! Bon appetit . ( SNIGGERS ) - Welcome to our team . - No way are you part of me . Oh , yes , he is . He 's the boy who pulled the legs off insects , the boy who held a magnifying glass to his best friend 's neck and watched him buuuuurn ! He 's the part of you who wants all your friends to fail . The part of you that loves to watch horror movies . The part of you that lusts after meaningless sex . He 's cruel . He 's selfish . He thinks terrible ... mmm ... things . He 's you . Ah , but he ... he kills . - I 'm not capable of that . - Ah , we 'll soon see about that . - Ugh ! - Whew ! Phew ! Hmm ... Nice movie collection . " Revenge of the Mutant Splat Gore Monster " . " Die Screaming with Sharp Things in Your Head " . Gore movies . Weapons magazines . This is a shrine to all that 's low and base , everything designed to sicken the soul and shrivel the spirit . Urgh ! Toastie Toppers . Urgh ! Cinema hot dogs . Oh ! Sweaty kebabs with stringy brown lettuce coming out . Oh ! Look at this music - " Hammond Heaven " , " Karaoke Krazy " , " Peter Perfect Plays Tuneful Tunes for Elderly Ladies " . - Let 's get outta here . - Oh , wait . Here it is ! Oh . Clearly , they have no idea as to its purpose . - How long do we have ? - Barely eight minutes , sir . Have I told today how much I love thee ? How much my heart glimmers like a newborn star when I gaze upon thine countenance ? Thy love refreshes and cleanses me like a babbling mountain stream . Your likeness , brother . ( THEY SNEER AND CACKLE ) A knife . Are you hungry , brother ? I have pulses and curd for your refreshment . Forgive me , brother . I have stained thy knife-end with my blood . A thousand apologies . Brother , let me provide a fresh knife . Farewell , brother , my brook is babbled . ( THEY GRUNT AND SNEER ) ( CRACK ) I found Goalpost-Head . No sign of Dormouse-Cheeks , though . - Sir , what happened ? - We were ambushed by Lows . - I led a valiant rearguard action . - I found him shivering in a box . - It was a tactical manoeuvre . - As was using his uniform as a latrine . - Where is Mr Lister ? - We got jumped . He ran off like a gazelle on steroids . We 'll have to leave him . In four minutes , this ship will no longer exist . What took you so long , buddy ? - What ? - Look out ! I 'm gonna kill ya ! I 'm a homicidal maniac . My body 's being remote-controlled by the Lows . Kryten , look out ! You gotta stop me ! - Shoot him ! - What ? ! - Blow his kneecaps off ! - Give me a break , Rimmer ! He 's homicidal . Put him down ! There must be another way to incapacitate me . There , Kryten . Hit him with that axe . - That 'll kill me ! - Not if he does it gently . - He 's killing the Cat . - What can I do ? Incapacitate me in a painless way . ( CRUNCH ) ( GASPS ) That was unnecessary . Unnecessary ? Look at my neckline . This stuff never springs back . Oh , my God ! I think I 'm going for the bazookoid ! Duck ! Left ! Right ! I 'm trying to reload ! Get behind me ! - I 'm coming behind you now , sir . - Take me by surprise . - I 'm taking you by surprise , sir . - Get on with it ! You may get an unpleasant sensation of chloroform ! - Surprise me now ! - Here comes my surprise , sir . OK . How long before the triplicator activates ? Less than two minutes . ( KRYTEN ) Hurry ! ( ENGINE WHEEZES ) ( CAT ) Damn ! Flat battery . Who left the lights on ? No , the magnetic coils have depolarised . It 's as if the decay here is contagious . - 35 seconds . - Try the back-up . ( ENGINE ROARS ) Let 's get out of here . All systems check . ( RIMMER ) We 're up . Looking good . - Not again ! - ( RIMMER ) Watch where you 're steering ! - Chloroform him ! - Wait . I 've located the spinal implant . - Where is it ? I 've lost it . - It 's in his neck . Holly 's back ! Mr Lister , wake up , sir . We 're safe now . Engaging autopilot . Course zero zero mark zero . Taking her home . See what you did to my blouson ? - Plus , you almost killed me . - It wasn 't my fault . - Once you get one of them things in you ... - Sir , what 's wrong ? - I think he just sat on the implant . - But who 's controlling him ? ( SNIGGERING ) I 'll remove the implant and destroy it . Uh-uh . Wait . One week , that 's all I ask . What are you talking about ? Boy , this is gonna be fun . # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

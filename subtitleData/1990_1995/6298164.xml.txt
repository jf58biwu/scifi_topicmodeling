 [ GYM NOISES ] [ PEOPLE CHEERING ] MIKE : Aw , I was beginning to think you weren 't coming . Game is almost over . SALLY : Doesn 't look like I missed too much . MIKE : It 's a game between teachers and students of the various departments . Mike , who is the power behind Houseman ? Behind Houseman ? God . The board of director likes him about as much as a blast of smoke in the eyes . [ CROWD CHEERING ] Then how is it last year he was able to attain financing of 200,000 dollars ? MIKE : Oh , yeah , yeah ! Because our young , eccentric and subordinate Dr. Houseman is the most brilliant genetic engineer the American University has produced in the last 10 years . You don 't ask a genius how he spends his money . [ CROWD CHEERING ] That is Peter Houseman . [ PEOPLE CLAPPING ] PETER : Physiology and medicine have cast light on the most inaccessible recesses of our organisms . Immunology has routed hundreds of invisible enemies to our health and ... Embryology has accomplished the joining of ovium and spermatoza in-vitro . But human genetics has taken only the first tentative steps forward . The genome is formed of approximately three billion components . These components are the letters in the genetic alphabet . Now calculate that if one wished to print the genome of man with an average of 10,000 characters per page ... Aren 't you exaggerating a little ? I only want to see if I can make him stutter . PETER : ... 1,000 pages each . And it is in the vast encyclopedia that our ... Hereditary patrimony of our species must be contained . Not only the color of our eyes . Not only the color of our hair . Not only the masterpiece of nature which happens to be the exciting thighs of our generous Patricia . [ ALL HOOTING ] But also the memory of millions of years of evolution . Fading shadows of races and generations which have all disappeared . It is our family album . Now , to be able to leaf through it from beginning to end and read it would be to know our past . Who we were , who we are and most importantly , what we will become . Professor , message . [ BELL RINGING ] Dr. Houseman , please , a moment . You can 't go in there ! There is no point being angry with me . I can 't do anything . And just whose good idea is this ? Not mine . The commission has decided that all funding requests must be accompanied by a report which details all work in progress . As well as the obligation to publish all experiments funded during the past year . This is not the agreement that we made when you offered to have me teach at this university ! Peter , be reasonable . It 's an order from the head office in New York . This is a private university . They want to know where the money they invest in research ends up ! If they send a woman from the administration to inspect , it 's not up to us and we can 't do anything . I took this job because you assured me a full liberty to carry on my research with no strings attached . No one wants to attach any strings . They only want a report on your experiments to date . Christ , Peter ! Your department has gobbed down almost a quarter of a million dollars in two years and you haven 't published a line ! - Oh , Lloyd , how are you ? - Oh , hello , Mike . - Dr. Owen . - Hi . Sally , this is Professor Lloyd , leads the biology department . Oh , Miss Donnelly ! And Dr. Owen is his assistant . - Nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you . So , you 're from New York . Mike ! PETER : Excuse me . Mike , I need your help . - If I can , Peter ... - Of course you can ! You 're one of the most senior members of the staff and the only one with a little brains . Mike , some inspectors-type is sticking her nose into the allocation of funds for research . - Peter , I don 't think ... - And I am being categorically forced into publishing my work before it 's finished . Each of us has to publish his work , myself included . LLOYD : I don 't see why you should be the exception . Because I don 't write jokes and I wouldn 't get the same laughs as you . MIKE : I 'm sorry , Peter . I can 't do anything . - Mike ! - We 'd better go . Gentlemen . Mike ! Publishing my work before it 's concluded is as much as calling it quits ! And it 's all the fault of some hysterical old maid in menopause ! You were at the game yesterday , weren 't you ? Peter Houseman . Maybe you can convince him to change his mind . I 'll try . But I wouldn 't expect too much from an hysterical old maid in menopause . Oh , Christ ! [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] What 's the composition ? WILLY : Nine parts serum and one part glucose dioxide . One part in 14 . - Triple the glucose . - But we 'll kill him ! I know , but I don 't want to run the risk of losing direction if it 's too weak ! I 'm sorry , Willy , we 're running out of time . It 's not my fault . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ STATIC ] WILLY : It 's penetrated the suprachiasmatic nucleus . Delta waves normal . Two cycles per second . Cardiac pressure normal . Willy , it 's perfect . WILLY : No , no , it 's not perfect . The alpha and beta waves are increasing . The pressure is rising . It 's an effect of the radiation on the limbic circuit evolution . It 's absorbing too quickly . Still rising . [ SCREECHES ] Absurd . It 's ridiculous ! Well , it is , nonetheless , a fascinating theory . If the data is exact . It 's impossible . He 's making fun of us . Houseman , your report is as scanty as it is fascinating . And notably imaginative . It would therefore be timely for you to elucidate the objective of your research . Given your request for new funding of 150,000 dollars . I was requested to report on what I was doing and to justify my expenses of last year . In my report , everything is specified down to the last cent . Now , as far as my experiments are concerned , they are based on the theory of the mechanism of auto-destruction by Brunet . A ridiculous theory which was abandoned by Brunet himself ! He abandoned it because , at the time , technology for proving it didn 't yet exist . Today , it is possible . And you have been successful ? Yes , even if further experiments are needed . You mean to say you 've successfully identified the genetic sequence ? - Yes . - But that 's magnificent ! Undoubtedly . Now , let me see if I have this right , Dr. Houseman . If you inhibit that protein , canceling the genetic code which creates it , in practice the cells will reproduce themselves integrally and in a constant manner , hmm ? - Yes . - So then , the organs would no longer become diseased . The cells of the liver , brain , bones , the skin would reproduce themselves forever . Which means that old age would be defeated . - And even death . - Perhaps . You are not only arrogant and megalomaniacal , you 're also stupid . - May I go now ? - Dr. Houseman , your experiments carried out to date , on what have they been performed ? On cell cultures . This I took for granted . But of what parasite ? No parasites . On rats , monkeys ? [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] Human embryos . [ HEARTBEATS ] [ HEARTBEATS ] [ HEARTBEATS ACCELERATING ] [ BEEPING ] - [ GASPING ] - [ BEEPING ] [ GASPS ] Those sons of bitches ! Those bureaucrats ! The only thing they care about is their soft job , and that pig Lloyd would trade his only remaining leg to see me with my back against the wall . Perhaps a more detailed research . One with ... With all the results of the experi ... No ! I want to finish the experiment and then report on it when it 's unequivocally successful . Only then will I publish everything . Don 't worry . We 'll find the money somehow . Even if I have to trade my shoes in . Well , I certainly hope it doesn 't come to that . I wouldn 't be able to live with myself . Look for the receipts , Willy , with the bookkeeper 's here . Forget it , Willy . I am not the bookkeeper . Excuse the interruption . PETER : That you are here ? Excuse me , I have some things I have to do . I got things I got to do , too . From the little I understand of your experiments , they 're really extraordinary . What 's that ? That 's a computer I supply with molecular anatomy . Fantastic . I know as much about it as I did before . What does it do ? Are you really interested ? Well , I am going to be 30 . I 'd like to stay that way . Every living organism , from the moment it is born begins a slow and inexorable deterioration , which I believe is predetermined by genetic information . Why predetermined ? From the moment that life stirred in an organism , it has no more or no less evolved . Always adapting itself into the environment in which it found itself . Casual genetic errors of reproduction produced mutations which the environment selected , rewarding the most adaptable and suppressing the others . Do you understand ? It 's the environment itself which establishes the rules of the game . Try to imagine what would happen if among many genetic errors occur one produced an individual which never aged , therefore didn 't die and who reproduced other individuals like himself . Well , first the environment would reward such a species . But before long , the species would become so dominant that every source known to man and space would be used up . Is that what you mean ? Right . And in more or less time , the race will become extinguished and leave a desert behind . Where did you go to college ? Columbia . I 'm convinced that the process of life defends itself by instilling the obligation of death to each individual . In other words , death is the price we must pay for the survival of our species . At least until now . If he had just followed customary procedure , nobody would have questioned him about anything . Foolishness . Insubordination simply cannot be tolerated in a university like this one . MIKE : However , before we shoot this whole thing down altogether I would suggest examining this project without prejudice . LLOYD : Now we have a lawyer for the defense ! MIKE : I 'm defending this institute . It would be very unpleasant to see his experiments published by another university , especially if it turned out to be correct . LLOYD : Has his assistant been questioned ? What 's his name ? [ CLEARS THROAT ] Willy Carson . MIKE : No , not yet . LLOYD : Willy , are you on foot ? No , I 've got my car parked just a block down the street . Get in , I 'll give you a ride . No , please , don 't bother yourself . It 's only a few steps away . LLOYD : Willy . I insist . PETER : How was lunch ? SALLY : You were the main dish . They served you up in every possible sauce . They 'll have a bad case of indigestion . They 've decided to suspend your research . They want to verify all the experiments that you 've carried out till now . They can 't do it . I have a contract which gives me the liberty of leaving and going elsewhere . They won 't let you to leave . Experiments with human fetuses was not authorized . If you leave , they will defer you to the disciplinary committee . That could block your work for years . I 'm sorry , Peter . It 's not your fault . You 're not to blame . Lloyd 's been trying to screw me for a long time . What will you do ? You 'll be the first to know . [ PHONE RINGING ] Yes ? WILLY : Hey Peter , Lloyd stopped me today . He asked me to work with him . He doesn 't lose any time , does he ? What 's happening , Peter ? I 'm trapped . As soon as they get the authorization , they 'll be coming to stick their nose in all of our work . After which , the experiments will continue under Lloyd 's supervision . WILLY : Isn 't there any way to stop them ? Yes . PETER : By trying out the experiment and proving that it works before they can intervene . WILLY : There are too many unknowns . It 's too big a risk . PETER : I know . [ SUSPENSE MUSIC PLAYING ] Okay , Dr. Houseman . [ BUZZING ] Tom , who came in ? TOM : Dr. Houseman . Okay . [ BEEPS ] [ SUSPENSE MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ WHIRRING ] [ BEEPING ] [ STATIC ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC CULMINATES ] [ PANTING ] [ RABBIT 'S BREATHING ] Thanks for the evening . Mike , I care for you very much , but sometimes ... Your wisdom is very discouraging . Forgive me if I don 't give up . It never hurts to keep trying . - Good night , Mike . - Good night , Sally . [ GASPS ] Calm down , Sally , it 's me . Peter , what are you doing here ? Well , I 'm keeping my promise . I told you that you would be the first one to know when I ... It 's after 1 : 00 . Can we talk about it tomorrow ? I beat them all . What do you mean ? The serum , it works . I tried it . - Tried it on whom . - On myself . I used a small dose , but the results were even better than I expected . Now I can publish everything and no one will dare to stop me . Peter , that 's fantastic . I 'm really happy for you . That 's all I really came to tell you . - You 're the only one who knows . - Thank you . - I guess I 'll be going . - Wait . Do you want to come in for a minute ? - Sure , if it 's not too late . - No ! - I 'll make some coffee . - Okay . [ DOG BARKING ] Alice ? Oh , hello , Sally . - Hello . - Hello . Oh , I went to sleep . Where 's Tommy ? He went to sleep too and I put him to bed . Hi , I wasn 't sleeping , I was waiting for you . Well , I would 've been disappointed if you hadn 't . But now , let 's go to bed . ALICE : I 'll go now , Sally . Call me tomorrow if you still need me . - Bye , Alice , thanks . - Bye-bye . Good night , Tommy ! Why don 't you say hello , instead of staring at him as if he were a rare animal ? His name is Peter . Hello , Tommy , how are you ? I 'm sleepy . Okay . Off to bed . Why don 't you take off your coat ? I 'll be back in a moment . Can I sleep with you ? No , dear . Mama has work to do . That 's why Dr. Houseman came over . Get a good night 's rest , dearest . Tommy 's a cute kid . - Are you divorced ? - No . I 've never been married . Tommy 's father was . Only I didn 't know it . Our romance was washed out by the terror in his eyes when I told him I was pregnant . Is this what you are looking for ? Thanks . What did you do to your hand ? I don 't know . Must have hit it against something . At least it isn 't bleeding anymore . Thank you . Do you want some coffee now ? [ SENSUAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] In the years 1953 to 1955 , it was proposed what afterwards came to be regarded as central dogma . Which affirmed that DNA did not directly participate in protein synthesis . But acted rather as a stamp for the synthesis of a molecule of RNA , which then repeated the DNA sequence . The authors of this dogma were ... Patricia ? Um ... Oh , my God , um ... I have it at the tip of my tongue . They were the same ones who discovered the helical structure . Yeah , exactly , I meant them . PETER : Steve ? Watson and Crick , sir . PETER : Very good , very good . Okay , that will be all for today . - Dr. Houseman ? - Yes . - What 's this ? - It 's my address . I 'm having a party at my house . I 'd like it if you could come . - When ? - Any day . Any time you like . [ INDISTINCT DIALOG ] Lloyd , you get the hell out of here ! Calm down . It 's not like you to lose your pragmatic cordiality . You get the hell out of here . You have no authority to be in here ! Oh , it 's only a matter of time . The usual bureaucratic delays . At times they are a little slow and one is tempted to go around them . I 'm sure you know how it is . Not this time , you won 't . You do me a favor and you drag yourself out of here . If the commission decides to continue this experiment , it will be under my constant and total control . You won 't be able to blow your nose in here without my permission . [ GROANS ] You did that on purpose . You saw him . I really couldn 't see very well . I 'm sure it was an accident , Dr. Lloyd . My God , Peter , the man is a cripple ! He 's not a man , he 's a worm . Willy , what is this ? I don 't know . This is blood . [ RABBIT BREATHING ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ PIANO MUSIC PLAYING ] Okay , Tommy . Look at me and smile . [ ANIMAL SOUNDS ] Maybe a little less . SALLY : Tommy , don 't be so crabby . Here , let me take the camera . I 'll take the picture . You don 't like me too much , do you ? No . That 's okay . I don 't like you either . But you know , some of the best friendships are born this way . Watch what they do when I give them these . [ MONKEYS HOWLING ] [ FRENZIED SCREECHING ] They are afraid . [ PANTING ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] TOM : Dr. Houseman . If you plan to return like you did the other night , I won 't close . What do you mean , like the other night ? The other night , you went in and came out twice . You plan to do the same thing tonight too , I won 't block the gate . You must be mistaken , I only came through once . Oh , here it is . You came in at 8 : 45 and left at 10 : 20 . And then you came back again at 10 past midnight and you left at 25 past midnight . I never sleep on my job . I remember , I asked you for a match and you gave me a packet . Here it is . You remember now ? You really don 't remember . I even lent you my handkerchief so you could tie up your wounded hand . - Can I have a beer ? - I 'm sorry , we 're closing . - I was here last night . - Really ? Do you remember me ? Maybe you should pull your pants down . - Then she 'll remember you . - [ MAN AT BAR LAUGHING ] Shut up ! Drinking beer ? Lots of people come here . We can 't be expected to remember everybody . That will be five dollars . [ SPITS ] You got the guts to come back here ? Bitch ! You bastard ! You ... Not on the face . Get him over here . So it 's true . You were here the other night . I don 't know why you were so stupid to come back . No ! Not me . That girl lost weeks of work because of you , you maniac ! No ! LLOYD : Bob , you must decide ! I cannot strip him off his authority all of a sudden . We would be risking an investigation and the institute will be involved . If he attacked you , he will indemn excuses . LLOYD : His excuses don 't mean anything to me . All I want is that his access to this laboratory be cut off immediately . He 's cooking something up . He was furious when he saw me in there . Anyone would be furious to find someone rummaging through their notes without authorization . Well then , let 's hurry up and get it ! Because I believe that arrogant bastard is trying to trick us . [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] [ TELEPHONE CONTINUES TO RING ] I 'm sorry Sally , I don 't know what to think . I 've looked for him everywhere , but no one 's seen him . Have you been to his house ? Yes .

At first , the results seemed positive . Then something happened . Something went wrong . - You 're freezing . - I know . My body assumes the temperature of the air around me . I don 't know why .

Lloyd got the authorization and they 're going through it - with a fine-tooth comb . - We 'll go back in at night . We 'll repeat the experiment and try to locate the error during the inoculation . It could make it worse . Willy , it 's a chance I 'm gonna have to take . I 'm dying . [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] Turn the volume down , Tommy . Hello . What ? Willy , what did you say ? I ... I saw him .

To block the development , the generic information that he believed , controlled cellular aging . But he opened up a dormant mutation . One that hasn 't been active for millions of years .

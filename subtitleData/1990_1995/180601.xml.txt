 [ Woman Narrating ] " Previously on " Earth 2 . [ Electronic Female Voice ] Away . [ Yale ] We were perhaps foolish to believe there was no intelligent life here . O 'Neill wants to follow those tracks , hunt down whatever creature stole our cargo . - [ Gasps ] - " We have crashed onto this planet . " We have lost most of our cargo . I just saw a man get killed by a rodent . [ Yale ] We have to be very careful . We are in a new place now . Everything is different . Commander O 'Neill died because he forgot that . [ Growling ] Grendler . Stay . Keep digging . I have ways of coaxing them back . Those fools will pay their toll yet . - Dig ! - [ Growls ] [ O 'Neill ] Let me out ofhere . ! I need air . ! Get off ! .I need air . ! Where am I ? What - What the hell - [ Danziger Narrating ] Been here three days , and some strange part of me longs for the space stations . I have no idea why . " There was no " there " there . " Nothing was real . Even in my own bed , my own unit , never felt like I was home . Wanted to run away and start over with a whole new hand . Twenty-two light-years from nowhere ? Some planet dancing 'circles around some scorching sun ? And me , some nomad on a six-wheeled camel , looking for shade . [ Chuckles ] Not exactly the new hand I was lookin 'to be dealt . Vehicle , halt . [ Engine Powers Down ] [ Beeping ] Hey , Danziger ! Why are we stopping ? Wasn 't designed for long hauls . It 's a mining vehicle . And damned if I 'm gonna burn her out the first day . Alonzo ! Lonzo ! Halt . ! We 're holding . ! [ Danziger Narrating ] Our pilot 's a different man now . When I met him , he was fearless . Sucked the marrow out oflife . Kid thought he could outrun gravity forever . Gravity caught up with him . Brought you some painkillers . Thanks . You had any more dreams ? Not gonna have them anymore . That 's done with . How do you know ? I mean , whatever they are , they contact " you , " right ? You 'rejust never gonna go to sleep again ? Alonzo ? Alonzo ? Alonzo , are you listening to me ? I 've never seen anything like this . [ Quiet Chuckling ] Bess ? Bess ? Morgan . Yes ? Honey , can you help me tie this on ? These KEVLAR straps keep coming undone . Bess , we 've got a problem . We got a problem here , and it 's big . The cyborg . We shouldn 't have one of those things with us . It 's not safe . Morgan , what are you talking about ? Yale is as nice as can be . Yale ! Exactly ! They 're defective , remember ? Morgan , we didn 't have Yales where I grew up . We had school . Nobody had Yales , Bess , except the richest families . A kid in my sector had one till his memory wash failed . The cyborg jumped 41 stories . They had to scrape him up off the station " fl " oor . These things - they 're loose cannons , Bess . They were supposed to have been recalled when I was a kid . All the Yales . The entire personal tutor project . How come this thing 's still around ? Let 's load ' em up , folks . We 're movin ' out . [ Danziger Narrating ] None of us knows what they did to that kid Ulysses - those creatures that stole him underground . Maybe we 're too afraid to ask . Come on , Uly . You 've walked enough . It 's time to get in . It 's okay , Mom . I 'm not tired yet . The boy certainly has your stubborn streak , doesn 't he ? I didn 't ask if you were tired , Uly . When 'd you last get your vitals taken , huh ? I want them taken every hour . Fifteen minutes ago . Good . We 're picking up a hitcher , Zero . [ Danziger Narrating ] With the setting of camp at the end of each day ... come the new unknowns life on the stations never prepared us for - the coming darkness , chill of night , the terror of sleep . [ Morgan ] Hey , bring those solar shields . How will the Terrians visit us next ? From below our feet ? In our dreams ? Will they reach out to our children ? Here 's a piece . A puny one . We should have loaded up on wood before we left the last place . They had good wood . Better fortunes over there . Dad , I 'm just gonna be with Zero . ! Okay . Race ya . [ Sighs ] When the Terrians were keeping me , they taught me all about ... their cool Terrian stuff . Like - Like the way they can stretch their arms really long ... so they don 't have to get up if something 's too far away for them to reach . Sticks like this one , but longer , they use for destroying their enemies . Really cool . But it 's a little cold down there . And-And the way their caves , they wind around ... so that they can confuse their enemies . [ True Screams ] True ? True ? Dad . ! [ Uly ] Mom . ! Dad . ! [ Devon ] Oh , God . Sweetheart , are you all right ? Oh , look ! The guy 's delirious or something . [ Man ] Finally made it . Knew you would get here . Shh . Just rest . We 're here . It 's okay . We 're here . Hey , buddy . Hey , listen to me . Are you the only person here ? Is there anyone else ? Dry . Water . Here , here , here . Shh . Here you go . [ Slurping ] Mmm . Nobody here . All alone . But you 've come for me . I knew you would come . Yeah . Shh . Just rest . We 're here , friend . We 're here . Your mom was stupid if she thought we were the only people here . Shut up . You 're the stupid one . You are . [ Both Gasping ] I thought you children were told to be in your beds ! Now , did you think we were joking ? Did you ? No . I cannot overstress the seriousness of you both ... following your directives here . Everything here is life and death . Do you understand ? Who is he , Yale ? [ Sighs ] We don 't know . We are trying to find out . He 's obviously very hurt . Are the Terrians gonna come up when we 're sleeping ... and come get us ? No . No . I 'm not scared . Even if they do , the Terrians are my friends . [ Scoffs ] Go to bed , Uly . [ True ] Good night . [ Uly ] Good night . [ Danziger Narrating ] The stranger travels light , carries only a story . Name 's Gaal . He says he was an astronaut , Pontel 7 project . His cold-sleep timer malfunctions , ship 's dragged into this sun 's orbit , crashes . Guy thinks he 's headed home , but wakes up here . No people for a billion miles . Stranded 15 years on this unknown planet . Just the horror ofloneliness to keep him company . Now he 's found us to welcome him . Someone should tell him I 'm not the welcoming kind . Can 't sleep either , can you ? Come again ? You . This godforsaken planet won 't let you sleep either . How did you know ? I know . I can feel a kindred spirit . Is it the Terrians ? Have they found you yet ? Do the monsters visit in your dreams ? How do I get them to stop ? I wish I knew . [ Sighs ] You didn 't come here to rescue me , did you ? We had no idea you were here . We came to found a colony , build a hospital for the children who can 't survive on the space stations . And your son was one of these children ? Yes . We , uh-We 're preparing to move eastward . We have no intention of being in any one place for too long . Our hope is to traverse this continent and be establishing a colony in New Pacifica ... within 11 months . We can 't offer you a way home for some time . I wish we could . We would like you to come with us . Leave here ? I should like that very much . [ Bess ] God , 15 years , and no other humans . I mean , can you even picture what that must have been like ? I imagine he doesn 't really know how long he 's been here ... because the days are so much shorter here and the years so much longer . And him being a Pontel 7 astronaut , just-just lost like that . [ Beeping ] Yale ? What is Pontel 7 ? Galactic exploration project . One-man vessel exploring an 11-light-year radius from Earth 's sun . It was essentially a pork barrel . Made the defense contractors happy for a couple of decades . Mission was scrubbed in 2168 . Three dozen missions , and not one shred of usable reconnaissance data . Basically charting meteors . Wow . You know a lot , Yale . Hi . Um , last night when you came to us so bruised and beaten - How did you get so hurt ? Grendlers . Uh - Grendlers are what I call ' em anyway . Slobbery rodents wouldn 't blink to rip the arm from your shoulder . And they could . Guess you haven 't had the pleasure . No . Uh , I - I think I 've seen one of those things . Short , squat , ugly things ? Hi . I 'm Morgan Martin , Deputy Secretary of Interstellar Development . How are you ? Guess you 've seen one then , friend . Last night , when I saw the lights from your camp , I thought it was a mirage . My rescue was here finally , after all these years . Then two of them ambushed me . Cleaned me out of everything I had . We had a cargo pod . Everything we brought was stolen - an aircraft , vehicles . That 's the Grendlers ' way . Traders by nature , but not above a little larceny . [ Devon ] Julia ? Could you come up here ? Um - Uh - Excuse me . [ Slurping ] [ Sighs ] Poor little thing . Well , I guess she does it out of hunger . What ? Who ? The little girl . Stealing extra rations , hiding them in that satchel of hers . Stealing food rations ? Well - I guess her father will reprimand her in time . Hey , get away from that ! Sorry , kid . You can 't have everything . Play by the rules . Give it to me ! No ! Let it go , Morgan . It 's not hers ! It 's all of ours . You can 't keep secrets from us . We 're all in this together . - [ Screams ] - [ Gurgling ] [ Moans ] Oh , my God . Oh , my God . It got me . One of those varmints . ! [ Groans ] [ Screams ] Bess ! Bess . Morgan ? Morgan ? Morgan ? Morgan . ! What 's happening to him ? Morgan ! Julia ! He 's got toxins everywhere . He 's lost his heart rate . [ Sobbing ] Cardio-vert . ! That 's not working . Cardio-vert ! Come back to me , Morgan ! Morgan ! I - [ Sobbing Continues ] Let me give it a shot . Let me give it a shot . - What are you doing ? - An old-fashioned military method . Danziger . We-We 've lost him . We 've lost him . Danziger . That 's enough . That 's enough . [ Bess Crying ] Please . ! Morgan . ! [ Crying ] Your husband will pull through . Please don 't say that , Gaal . He 's dead . There are secrets of this planet you do not yet understand . He 's not dead . I 've been stung by these rodents a dozen times , and I 'm still here to tell the tale . What are you talking about ? The worst effect their stings have on humans is to put them into a state of coma ... for a short while-maybe a day or two , at the best of my estimation . He will wake up . Give him time . - You mean it 's not fatal ? - I guarantee it . Oh , my God ! Our commander was stung two days ago . We thought he was dead , and we buried him . [ Danziger Narrating ] The chances that Commander O 'Neill was still alive , buried under five feet of earth ? Probably six million-to-one . But we weren 't going back for him . We were going back for ourselves . We couldn 't live , not knowing . Oh , my God . Oh , this can 't be happening . My worst fear . Grendlers got here first . Preliminary resonant scan of the area show no sign ofhuman body warmth , at least not aboveground . Let 's organize a search party immediately , okay ? Sure . How are we doing ? It 's amazing , the strength coming back to his lungs . The levels are almost normal . Think I 'm , like , maybe becoming part Terrian or something , and we could ask the Terrians to help us , you know , find Commander O 'Neill ? And I could ask them ... 'cause they think I 'm probably their prince or something , and I could just command them . You were sick for a very long time , Ulysses Adair , and I want you to take it easy . You don 't want to end up back in your immuno-suit , do you ? No . He really is showing strength . His mother wants him resting . I 'll be back soon . Where 'd you go ? Hmm ? I saw you coming back from the north this morning . North , south , east , west . I was out looking for your good commander . Unsuccessfully , I might add . Uh-huh . Well , do me a favor , will you ? Anything . Next time you decide to go wandering off , let somebody know . Keep us from worrying about you . Of course . The Grendlers , you know , they 're like ants - strong , ruthless , can carry seven times their own body weight , crush a man 's skull with one hand if they wanted to . I 've managed to trade with some of them over the years . May I have your permission ... to try to contact them in the search for our good commander ? How do you plan on doing that ? Well - [ Inhales ] I speak their language . [ Machinery Beeping ] [ Sighs ] Bess ? Yes ? I know you probably don 't care , but - [ Sighs ] I just want to say I feel bad . I mean , I didn 't mean for anything to happen . I ... just thought the Koba was my friend . You 're right , True . I don 't care . I hope Morgan gets better . Thank you . You 're a smart person , True . I 'm trusting that you don 't have to learn your lesson a third time . No , ma 'am . Can I wait here with you ? [ Trilling Whistle ] [ Whistle Blows ] Whoa ! Easy there , buddy . Here . I 'll teach you how to run better . You gotta bend your knees . That 's important . Bend ' em . Lift them up nice and high , like that . Okay , good . Now , when you see a rock , you gotta see it before you get there and jump over it . That 's coordination . And you move your arms , all right ? Lift your knees . Ready ? Okay , let 's go . That 's it . That 's it . Move your arms . Lift ' em up there . Lift ' em up . Jump over those rocks . Attaboy . That 's good . That 's real good . Excuse me . What are you doing with my son ? Just taking advantage of some of the wide open spaces around here . What happened to your knee ? Nothing , Mom . I was running . It 's called a scrape . I want you to go seeJulia , honey , right away . Hey , your kid is healed , Adair . You got your wish . Let him breathe a little . I am pushing him at my own speed , and please don 't tell me how to be a parent . I see how you manage your own daughter . What 's that supposed to mean ? It means , I think I would know what kind of pets my kid was keeping . Listen , we are all doing this for the first time . I would stop making assumptions about how people raise their kids . What is that ? What is it ? Easy . Let me deal with the creature . Yale , come check this out . Mangiest-looking thing in the whole universe . Wouldn 't even wipe his mouth . I think I 'm gonna puke . We shouldn 't judge these Grendlers by our standards of good hygiene , though he 's quite unpleasant . And he 's coming back . Hey , he 's coming ! [ Devon ] What happened ? Your good commander is still alive . They have him ? That one says he knows where he is . So how do we get him back ? The Grendlers want to trade . They asked for your three power generators . Our generators ? We won 't survive without them . - I know . I talked them down . - To what ? One . [ Blows Whistle ] Morgan ? Morgan , if you can hear me , you have to wake up now . I need you too much . I never would have come this far away from home without you . We 're a team . Please , Morgan . Please . [ Morgan Exhales ] He moved . He 's back . [ Laughs ] [ Groans ] I 'm ... not dead , am I ? No , you 're not dead , honey . [ Chuckles ] [ Loud Crashing ] What was that ? I don 't know , Morgan . No . ! Don 't go , Bess . Don 't leave me , please . Not with her . She 's good people , Morgan . Just lay here and relax , and I 'll be back in a minute . I 'm just gonna go see what that was . No . Shh . [ True ] Be careful . [ Screaming ] Bess . You shouldn 't have buried me . [ O 'Neill ] I don 't know where they held me . The creatures kept me from seeing . Seems like it was underground . That 's my best guess . Those vermin . If I thought any of you had any guts , we 'd hunt them down tonight . Any takers ? Why , uh-Why don 't you just get some rest , Broderick ? - We 're just all so happy that you 're here . - Thanks to Gaal 's help . Whatever they are , I heard words . Nothing made sense to me , but they can talk . Incredible mimics , the Grendlers . I taught a few of them a handful of jargon over the years . Spread like the wind . Come here , son . Oh , my goodness . What did they do to you ? We don 't really know . They healed me . His whole metabolism seems to have strengthened , even on the molecular level . Well , welcome to the world of the breathing . How are you holding up ? [ Whispers ] Alonzo ? [ Echoing ] Where am I ? Who are you ? How did you get here ? I thought there were no other people here . [ Buzzing ] [ Gasps ] What did it do to you ? [ Clanging ] [ Panting ] What 's going on ? It 's all right , friend . They had you in their grip . You were dreaming . [ Muttering ] Thank you , Gaal . Not at all . Who else to rescue you from your demons ? What the hell do you want , Martin ? I need to know something , Commander . Um , you know , that rodent thing ... that stung you ? It stung me too . And for a while there , biologically speaking , it seemed like we were both dead . [ Weapon Cocks ] What 's your question ? Well ... uh , for that little time there , when you were dead , where did you go ? Where did " you " go ? Oh , I - I don 't know . A scary place . There was bright light everywhere . I couldn 't see . And there was this scratching sound , constantly gnawing . I can 't think of anyplace worse , nowhere . Is that ... sort of where you went ? No , Martin . I went to a better place . I finally felt like ... I was home . Home . Oh , wow . Do you think I went to hell ? I think you just weren 't ready to die yet , Martin . Hey , Uly ! Whatcha doin ' ? Watching for Terrians . Next time I see one , I 'm gonna make friends with him , bring him back to the camp ... so everyone can meet him . What are you doing ? Well , I thought I 'd go for a little run . You know , just around , take advantage of all this space . Think it 's safe ? [ Chuckling ] You sound like my husband , Uly . I 'm bringing my gear . Hey . You wanna come with ? Just admiring . Ah . I never made it to Earth . Never saw one of these land vehicles . Well , I only got there once before myself . Tour back in ' 64 . Indian Ocean . Word is you were with the Pontel 7 project , worked for my old pal Larrabee . [ Scoffs ] Sorry , no . Larrabee ? Yeah , he headed up the project . Damon Larrabee . Had a gap between his teeth bigger than mine . No ? No . Well , maybe you were before his time . I must have been . I was one of their nascent missions . Ah . Listen , what was the deal with those Pontel ships ? What was their fuel source , antimatter ? I 've been alone on this planet for 15 years , no one to keep me company . Actually , I count myself lucky that I 've yet to go insane . I 've forgotten my days as an astronaut . It was a different lifetime . Ah . Of course . Broderick , can , uh - can I talk to you for just a minute ? - Sure . - " Allow me to , um , excuse myself . " [ Devon , Softly ] Thank you . What 's up ? I 'm worried about you . - Why ? I 'm fine . - [ Sighs ] I know that your every instinct is to be out there seeking retribution . [ Chuckles ] What are you thinking , Devon ? O 'Neill 's a loose hinge , gonna go out , get himself killed again ? Is that it ? I know that going through what you went through - to the other side like that - must make you feel invincible or something . What , you been talking to Morgan Martin or something ? Actually , I have . [ Laughs ] Well , dying ' didn 't make that guy feel invincible , did it ? Just use caution . Always . Thank you . Take it easy , Uly . Wait up , Uly . Stay where I can see you . Uly ? Uly . ! Uly ? Are you all right ? I was waiting for you . Oh . Okay . Let 's get going . [ Twig Snaps ] I 'll see you , Uly . Bye . [ Man ] Hey , you guys . Over here . Hi . Hello , Ulysses . What are you lookin ' at ? Maps , routes to New Pacifica . [ Sighs ] I went for a run . Mmm . I 'm sorry , Mom . I 'll take better care of myself . I know how much you 've done for me . Will you please go get your immuno-suit ? Immuno-suit ? It 's right inside . Why do you have it out again ? I mean , I 'm healthy , right ? Please ? [ Sighs ] I 'm healthy , right ? You-You understand , right ? We have a space problem , Uly . We have this immuno-suit , and , uh , we don 't know where to put it . You mean I don 't have to wear it again ? No . But now that you can take care of yourself , Uly , you have to take care of your things , and the suit is yours , and you need to find a place to put it . I can do that . I know you can . Thanks . [ Loud Clattering ] I 'll be damned . [ Approaching Footsteps ] [ Growling ] [ Snorting ] [ Clattering ] Human ? [ Groans ] Just call me a magpie , Commander . [ Loud Squawk ] [ Laughing ] My gut told me you weren 't Pontel 7 . Thought it was a pretty good story myself . Fooled the others . Who the hell are you ? How 'd you get here ? Oh , I 'm just a poor boy being punished , Commander . Figured they were keeping this place a secret . I assumed that a man of your rank - You weren 't sent here alone , were you ? Oh , I had company . Others like myself , who the space stations didn 't want around anymore . So here they sent us - the undesirables . Killers , rapists . To a penal colony . Well , what happened with the others ? We were craven , Commander . Only I was just a tad more craven than the others . I won the survival contest . Why don 't you have a weapon , Commander ? - What makes you think I don 't ? - ' Cause I guess you would have used it by now . - Well , not necessarily . - [ Yells ] - [ Gunshot ] - Do you want to die , Commander ? Is that it ? Because I can accommodate you . I 've killed 26 now . Twenty on the stations , six after I got here . Your friends are in peril , Commander . In time , the women , needy of guidance , will follow me . [ Loud Grunting ] And the men , they will follow you . Don 't you hurt the others ! - Do it . - [ Growling ] [ Gasping , Grunting ] - [ Growling ] - " [ Bones Cracking ] " [ Strangled Screaming ] Help . ! Help . ! The commander ... in the woods . [ Panting ] The Terrians . I tried to fight them . What ? What happened ? They got him . [ Danziger Narrating ] Every day we discover only how much more we have yet to learn ... about this planet , how to survive here . Commander Broderick O 'Neill learned his lessons twice . Maybe now he knows something we don 't . New Pacifica still beckons . For some it 's the place that holds the promise of Eden . For others it 's our best hope to get home . We don 't know how we 'll get there , don 't know what dangers lie ahead , but at least we have a guide now . [ Laughing ]

[ talking and laughing ] I wonder if they 're somehow related to ... I don 't believe this . Clark is the least curious person I know . [ ♪ music ♪ ] Who are you people ? I can step out into space and I can fly . [ laughter ] Careful . [ screaming ] [ whimpering ] Kee-ah ... What ? Ah ... I am ... Katia . As far as his family is concerned , he was a normal guy . How 's it coming ? Slowly . What are you doing ? Superboy told the police the guy 's last word . Katia . I thought I 'd run it through some of our linguistics programs . Anything come up ? Well , a couple of things . In Gaelic it 's a whiskey that 's served at wakes . [ laughs ] Wrong kind of flying . And in Mongolian it means ... [ laughter ] I 'd keep looking . Matt can I see you a minute ? What 's up ? I just need you to make some quick checks , file a few reports , you know make us look good at the home office . Basically sweep a few things under the rug to meet our quota . We 're paid to be skeptical . That 's not why I took the job . I thought we were supposed to identify and investigate unexplained phenomena , not make up rational explanations for em and file em away . Just play ball with me this once . I 'll get someone else next month . As I see it , we 're responsible for what happened to Malcolm . If we hadn 't started this , he never would have died . No my brothers . No . What happened was tragic . But it was not a sign or a warning . It was an accident . Nothing more . Now . I have gathered all of you here so that we may celebrate our birthright . A gift given to us by God himself to put us above all other men . All our lives we have scraped and scratched to survive in this world . They will call us Gods . They 'll look up at us in wonder . Now I don 't know about the rest of you but I just can 't walk away from that . But , isn 't this all irrelevant . We need seven to summon up the powers . I have found another descendant of our people ... right here in Capitol City . Who is he ? Matt Ritter ? Yeah . Son of Delano Ritter , grandson of Clement Ritter ? What can I do for you ? My name is Tio Valjean . I have some information that could very well change your life . Well , I have everything I need , Mr. Valjean . But thank you . What if I told you that your bloodline gave you the opportunity to be a God among men ? ... to do things other men only dream about ? I 'd say what I was gonna say before . Goodbye . Well , whether you like it or not , you are one of the Katia . Still skeptical Mr. Ritter ? Well , I can understand how a myth like this could have been created by slaves longing for their freedom ... This goes way beyond slavery . It 's about our heritage . Faith in our history . Faith in yourself . It 's our destiny . And I can assure you Mr. Ritter , this is no myth . This is Matt Ritter . He 's gonna give us our power back . Whoa , wait a minute . I can 't ... How can you be so sure ? What if we bring him in and he isn 't one of us ? Then the power will be taken away . Well Joseph there 's only one way to find out . [ drumming ] Katia . Katia . Katia . [ chanting ] Katia . Katia . Katia . [ chanting continues ] Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . [ all chant and shout ] Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . [ shouting ] Ah ! Katia . Katia . Katia . Concentrate , Brother . Katia . Katia . [ drumming ] Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia , Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . [ sizzling sound ] Katia . Katia . Katia . Welcome , brother . You resigned . Why ? I came here to explore all the big mysteries of the world . Now I 'm finding that sometimes the biggest mysteries are bottled up inside yourself . I don 't know if you guys can appreciate that . What happened to you ? You play with fire , you get burned . Why can 't you say you grabbed a hot frying pan , like a normal person ? I 'm gonna miss you guys . Look I gotta go to payroll . I 'll talk to you guys later . [ beeping ] I found it . - What ? - Katia . It 's an ancient African dialect . It 's the name of a tribe . It translates to " the flying people . " Damn lawyer . Bet he 's never done an honest day 's work in his life . How long have you known Teo ? About what ? About the fires . What do you know ? That they only happen when we do a ritual . You knew about it , didn 't you ? Look . That 's just a natural side affect . That 's not our fault nor our concern . We 've been given a gift . A power that gives us dignity . Do you want to give that up because of a few fires ? What happens when the others find out ? The power is strong . Matt and John are the only two who haven 't felt it . After they 've experienced it , they won 't care either . Tio . They came to the Lecroix plantation in the year before the Civil War . The cotton was in full bloom . There were ten of em all men . Had just been bought fresh off the boat from Africa . They were sort of wild acting , and not trained in the ways of the Lecroix plantation folks . Anyhows , my great-grandmamma who was nothing but a young girl and looking for a husband . She could tell that there was something else different about these Africans . One of them took a liking to her . And every time he got a chance , he 'd sneak up on her and whisper , " Katia . Katia . " Then he 'd point to the sky . Anyhows , late that night , she snuck over . And there she saw the Africans dancing and singing around that fire . But then just as she was watching , one by one , the Africans began rising up in the sky . She ran out just as her friend was climbing up , like he was climbing a ladder into the sky . And she screamed , " Take me with you . Take me . " But he just looked at her . Smiled . Touched his chest and said , " Katia ! " And flew off . Before she knew it , they were all gone . Every single one just up and flew away as free as you please . She told everybody . She never got tired of telling the story of them Africans who could fly . She told it to all her children . And she told them to tell it to all there children . Once there was a tribe of Africans who could reach up and touch the sky . So then the recent sightings are descendants from the original tribe ? Well after the Civil War , my great-grandmamma learned that the Katia had settled nearby ... living as free men . She began to keep track of all the male descendants . Because they carried the power in their blood . She passed it on to my mother . And now I keep the record . All the modern descendants are on this chart ? If they 're Katia , they 're there . Matt 's on here . Is this a friend of yours ? Yeah . There 's more to the legend that 's not pleasant . The legend has it that when a man goes into the sky , a fire creature is forced down upon the earth . trapped drawn to whoever is keeping him here so that he can be released . How does that fit in with your great grandmother 's story ? The night the African 's flew , the Lecroix plantation burned to the ground . You can still see the ruins just outside of town . The power is best left untouched . I hope Matt gets home soon . Look at this . Malcolm Elliot died here right ? Mm hm . And here are where the fires are broken up . All within the radius of the Lecroix plantation ones . We interrupt this broadcast for another special report . More fire have been set off throughout the city as a result of some strange and unusual mass that has taken violently to the streets . This time in the Northeastern part of the city . Oh , no . The police advise that everyone stay off the street ... I was supposed to get the viewer 's reportto the fire chief and I never did . I better get down there and hand deliver it . I can drive you . No , uh . Wait for Matt . It 'll be better . It 'll be faster if I take a cab . I , I ... trust me . Trust you ? The Northeastern section . [ drumming and chanting ] [ shouting ] Katia . Katia . It 's your time . [ drumming ] [ chanting ] Matt ! You have to stop this . What are you doing here ? You 're endangering people You have to stop . What are you talking about ? You shouldn 't be here . Every time you fly , this thing comes down and starts fires . What ? Is that true ? No . No , no . She 's lying . She 's jealous . It 's on the radio if you don 't believe me . Don 't listen to her . We have to stick together , Matt . Or they will come and try to turn us against each other . How can this be wrong . It 's not wrong . God gave this to us . How can it be wrong ? Matt , it 's your time . I can 't . Not if it means putting other people in danger . We have been placed above other people . God gave us this right . No . Nothing gives us that right . No . No . No . No . John . John . John , you 're with me . John . Stephen , Stephen . They 're trying to tear us apart , Stephen . Joseph , Joseph , Joseph stay with me . Stay with me , Joseph . We started . We were together at the beginning , Joseph . - No . - OK . OK ! I don 't need any of you . I 'll do it by myself . I don 't need you . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . Katia . [ laughter ] Look , look , look . I can do it by myself . I don 't need anybody . I can do it by myself . [ screams ] Matt . I just wanted people to respect me . They were always looking down on me . Just once . I wanted them to have to look up to see me , You all right ? I came so close . Matt . Whoa . Yeah .

 He 's for you , Kruger . Don 't move or I 'll blow your brains out ! No ! The reward is bigger with him alive . Really , this car is becoming our main office ! It 's much more discreet , no bugs , no camera ... Believe me , Norton , I prefer it this way for our meetings . I have good news for you . The lawyers have suceeded . We 'll be able to execute Calvin . - You 're serious ? - Yes , my dear , they found a loophole . The death penalty is abolished nowadays but it used to exist in the past . - You mean that ... - Exactly ! We just need to send Calvin back in time and execute him legally . I confess it 's a great idea . Who will be in charge ? Kruger already offered his help . We need to pay him well of course . That 's the heart of the matter . We don 't have the funds for such a trip . Come on , Norton ! That 's why we 're paying our lawyers a fortune . They discovered a scientific project , a time travel expedition during the age of the first dinosaurs . Their funding is insufficient . We 'll just have to contribute our share . Pliers . Stop that guy from yelling , it 's really upsetting in the end ! Someday someone will hear their screams and we 'll be in trouble . We can 't have trouble with a Number 0 . He 's already dead . I just had him ressurected for this experiment . For the dead he has quite a voice ! - And what did you find ? - Fear effects on the pupil . When the pliers approached the eye , he saw the picture with a great intensity ! - Alright but what about commercial implications ? - I don 't care . It 's not important . That 's enough , Hernandez ! I 've suffered your fake experiments for ten years ! Profitability ! I want profitability ! We 're certain that remains of the jurassic era have survived on our twin planet Terra . Mainly dinosaurs . Satellite pictures are clear . Look at this one . It 's a joke ! This picture is part of the Playboy archives ! No , it 's a real satellite picture . Although the she-creature in evidence strongly intrigued us . I 'm beginning to understand why you need additional funding to put up this expedition . Additional funding granted . In exchange you will have to take this criminal and his executioner aboard . He will do his job on Terra with the method of his choice and he will come back with your crew . Calvin will be buried on Terra . If I 'm following you , this criminal will become a Number 0 . - I 'm suggesting an experiment . - That 's enough , Hernandez ! You cried enough to be in charge of this dinosaur hunting trip ! Forget about the rest . You heard ? It 's our lucky break ! I 'll make arrangments to have you in the crew . Sixty days ! Sixty days and sixty nights ! What 's the idea ? Sacking Hernandez from the project on a whim ! It 's me who deposited a patent for the cardiac reanimator . Deposited , not invented . It was Hernandez 's invention and each sale makes you richer day after day . The patent was deposited in my name . That 's the only thing that matters . Everyone can do that ! Each man has the right to be lucky once in his lifetime ! But you 're lucky everyday ! You 're hinting at Peguy , I presume ? Her fortune helped me to start but it was a great cost all the same . It 's been 15 years that I supported her . Yes but you can 't leave her since she has all the shares . You could be tactful and try and avoid mentioning her when we 're alone . Sometimes I want to kill her . In this case I could kill you too because you would not stay single ! Spencer , what 's the situation ? We have not deviated from our course . In exactly 3 days we 'll reach Terra . Wake up Professor Nolan . Look at the geniuses ! They want to explore the galaxy and they can 't stand a rocket-ship air-blast ! Where is Nora ? Surprised , my dear husband ? Peggy , not you ! How did you manage to get embedded ? Don 't worry ! Your dear Nora is snoring but she will wake up soon like everyone on earth ! Don 't you think I 'm a good substitute for her ? And I think that I can do her job as well . I look forward to be photographed with these beasts . It won 't be a very pleasant trip , you know . It 's not a picnic . - You will stay aboard during the expedition . - Certainly not . - Never ! And it should be funny to see you whack this man ! How will you manage to do it ? A bullet between the eyes . On the first day I hope . I 'm so excited to see him dying . There 's plenty of time . Asshole . If he 's still alive tomorrow , I will allow myself to do the job in your place . Rest assured . If Kruger don 't I will do it . Hey , photograph man ! Be ready with your camera ! When this scum will whack me it will be the scoop of your life ! There will be no picture . Then maybe you will have the picture of my escaping ! I don 't think so . Look at these vultures ! They will kill themselves to get the reward ! It 's now or never for experiment Number 0 ! It 's not the time for this . We 'll be busy enough with the dinosaurs . Take him out of here . This part of the mission is not to my liking . Hurry back . Let 's go . That 's it ! We 're on Terra 's orbit . Breathable atmosphere but oxygen content slightly lower than that of the earth . On the other side the probe reveals a significant amount of pollution . We knew that . Previous dictators used Terra as a garbage planet for earth . It 's full of toxic nuclear wastes . It must be dangerous . I told you so . More reason to stay quietly aboard the ship . Would I be so safe with all these young men in here ? - Of course , I 'd never cheat ! - I 'm trusting you ! Not sure we 'll see a dinosaur . Maybe the pollution killed them all . What is that ? It 's proof that pollution has not decimated all the human life on this planet . The growl came from this area . I 'm certain there are dinosaurs in this forest . Help ! Help me ! Hurry up ! Help me ! You didn 't move , bastard ! You would be happy with me dead , won 't you ? Why are you saying that darling ? I was paralysed by fear , that 's all . Shut up ! You dirty bastard , you could help me ! I 'm not paid to help you . It could be a shinbone with the end chewed-up . Marrow is gone . - By a dinosaur ? - No doubt about it . But nothing proves the shinbone is from an human being . Given the size of the footprints this one must be huge . They 're nearby . How could we approach them without taking too many risks ? We need something to lure them . A bait . They 're flesh-eating animals . We should use the murderer to lure them . If they don 't smell blood they won 't come . We have to hurt him . You 're right . We have to hurt him enough for him to bleed out without dying too soon . A hand is enough . I agree . Time 's running out . Our reserves are not inexhaustible . Kruger , finish your job . Why now ? You have to do it anyway . Let 's get rid of this chore . - Before we meet the monsters . - Oh , yes , right now , right now ! You have no right . You had no right either bringing me on this planet . I know my rights . Your rights ? On this deserted planet ? Be reasonable man . Better to die for the scientific cause than from a bullet in the head . Come on , both of you ! Seize him ! Keep going ! He just fainted ! Drag it several meters to distribute the blood . We just have to wait now ! We 'll camp here and take turns keeping watch . I can 't sleep ! His whining gets on my nerves ! We could have camped a little farther . We must be ready if a dinosaur appears . Only blood can lure them . But it 's really annoying ! He could suffer in silence , this scum ! Take shelter ! All of you ! Quick ! No , don 't shoot ! ( Inaudible ) - At least we could bury the poor Chris . - I 'll keep watch . But you could go and try to get his camera . Maybe he took interesting pictures that we could sell . We 'll see that tomorrow . It 's too late for Chris . And nobody will steal his camera tonight anyway . We must run away ! It 's too dangerous ! Take cover ! There 's another one ! You asked for trouble , you got them for sure ! One makes mistakes in his life . Kruger waited too long before killing Calvin . My mistake was this damn expedition . And my marriage ! Where is Peggy ? Forget that fool ! We have no way of communicating with the rocket-ship . And our compas is broken . Maybe they 're looking for us . Maybe they 're inside a dinosaur 's belly ! This expedition is a disaster ! All these years of preparation to end up sweating our way out of this shithole ! And yet we had anticipated every step . Except that dinosaurs run faster in reality than on your damn books engravings . My make-up case ! Don 't move ! He didn 't see us yet ! I won 't abandon my make-up case to these damn beasts ! I 'm going for it . I 'm OK to die but with my face made up . No ! Get him away ! Help me out ! You see ! I made him run away ! Let 's go . The forest will make a good shelter . And now ? A camera disappearing and a prisoner escaping . It can 't be a stroke of luck . I don 't understand . Asshole scientists ! Did you ever think that maybe this planet was inhabited ? It 's impossible ! Maybe not . In the past this planet was used to store toxic waste . Maybe one of the crew was stranded here , I don 't know . They must be very old now ! Where is she coming from , that one ? Who are you ? Where do you come from ? Do you speak english ? My name is Tania . I live here . And I saw your rocket-ship landing . Nobody ever landed here before us . This planet was only a garbage dump . Come on , relax . You 're welcome on this planet . I 'm going to perform the greeting dance . A splendid alien ! Evidently she 's not wearing the most cumbersome costume ! Where do you live ? The area is dangerous . Do you want to join us in our expedition ? Are you crazy ? It 's the last thing we need . This guy is completely nuts ! I need to mate now ! Do you want to come with me ? Wait . Not here . Follow me . Hello ? Hello ? Do you copy me navigation bridge ? It 's Nolan here . Do you copy ? Hello ? I 'm listening . Hello ? Hello ? Do you copy me navigation bridge ? There 's no answer . Take his weapon . Give it . I 'm sorry if I can 't shake your hand but I 've become a sort of a Captain Hook of the Jurassic park ! Me , I 'm Red-beard , the most ugly girl in the area . But I 'm failing in my duties . We 're spoiling your little pets these days . Tomorrow we 'll take care of the others . Wait for me ! I 'm certain you 're glad to see me ! I 'm so sure of that I would stake my hand on it ! Come on , let 's go . I 've brought you fresh meat ! Great ! Where is Kruger ? What have you done with him ? It 's horrible ! You too will satisfy her pets appetite ! You tortured me ! You mutilated me ! It 's your turn now ! Don 't let this criminal make an accomplice of you ! Come on , Harry ! Do something ! - Do something yourself ! - You 're not a man ! And you , Hernandez , you could try to do something ! My dinosaurs deserve to live like you . Come on , my darlings , eat up ! Come on , Calvin . They like to dine quietly . Nothing ! Radio contact is cut off ! We must look for them . We 're going to be eaten by a monster ! What a glorious end ! I told you so . - I managed to get free ! - Hurry up now and untie us ! It 's coming back ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! I could get you free but ... I need you to promise me something Number 0 ! Ok . Make it fast . My make-up case ! Dead ! They 're all dead ! All of them ? Follow me . We 're going to the rocket-ship . So long dinosaurs , so long savage girl ! This expedition was a complete mess . All these dead people . And Calvin was not executed . We missed a good show ! I 'll have to account for all this . Maybe not . We can still say that Calvin was executed . They will never know the truth . We 'll say she did the job . - I 'm satisfied if I get the reward . - You mean half the reward . The other half will be the price of our lies ... and our remorse . - Harry ? - Yes . I was followed in the corridor by some sort of monster . What do you mean ? - It 's true . I swear . A kind of cat-monster . - A cat ? - Here ? - You 've got to do something ! I 've seen it . It looked like a big cat ! What 's that noise ? It 's that big cat like I told you . It can 't be a cat . Or it 's swallowed a jet engine . I 'll have a look . But it 's not possible ! Don 't worry ! She 'll take care of it . Despite her tough looks she has pets at home . Keep quiet . I 'm going there . Stop it ! Get it outta of me ! Let me go ! Help me ! At last ! How did she die ? Her throat was torn . - She was bitten by a cat-beast . - It was really a ghastly sight ! What is a cat-beast ? It 's another experiment gone wrong from this damn Hernandez ! I saw him bringing something suspicious aboard . Suspicious ? What does she mean ? It 's true . He was hiding something . We even lost touch with him at one point . Confirmed . Why didn 't you tell me ? A parcel ? What shape ? I didn 't get a good look . It was round or oval . Oh no ! An egg . He did not bring an egg aboard ! An egg ... A dinosaur 's egg . How could he take the liberty of bringing samples without warning the crew ? - Or me ! I 'm the most concerned here ! - This Hernandez is a madman ! Mad and dangerous . Captain , we must act now ! We must find him before the beast gets too comfortable ! Where is he ? Bring him here immediately ! - We must find him and condemn him ! - He 's a madman ! Where is he ? Bring him here immediately ! Hernandez , what did you bring aboard the ship ? I hope it 's not a dinosaur 's egg ? Answer now ! Someone is dead ! - What is your answer Professor ? - We 're going to die now . One after the other . What is he holding in his hand ? Show it . It 's horrible ! What 's happening to your hand ? It 's horrible ! - Look at this ! He 's going to contaminate all of us ! - It stinks ! You know the rule in this instance . Amputate or burn . Quick ! Make a choice ! Come on , let 's burn him ! - Come with us ! - No ! No ! Can we get a look ? Come on , let 's roast him ! You like that ! It smells good ! The other side now ! Count on us , Hernandez , we have the cure for you ! - No contact at all . - Try again . Nothing . Contact is cut off . It 's ghastly ! She can 't get the reward anymore . We 'll have to talk about it . Unit # 5 is not answering neither . Those winos are probably sleeping it off in a corridor . I can 't reach Unit # 5 . Liaison is cut off . Hello ? Unit # 5 ? They 're probably still sleeping ! Look ! What is he doing ? Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! What 's happening now ? It 's the fault of that bloody fool of Hernandez . He brought this beast aboard the ship . I can 't believe it ! I 'm afraid ! Harry ! It has bitten me ! Stop playing the barefoot Contessa ! Let 's get out of here pronto ! You 're detestable ! It will restrain the dinosaur for a while . Open the door ! Open the door ! I want to get out ! I want to get out ! Let me out ! Let me out ! Let me out ! - Where are the others ? - Dead . All of them . - Professor Hernandez too ? - Especially Professor Hernandez ! He deserved what he got . - Other exits are out of reach . - The beast is gaining ground . It will have us too . It 's too dumb to die like that ! We must find a way out ! We need to stay together . It 's behind the door . The door is tight but the beast gets stronger and it won 't hold him very long . Listen ! It 's silent now . It moves around . Quick ! Let 's hurry ! Listen ! It 's silent now . It moves around . timing : meatisgood translation : aloysius70

 - the name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years , I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now ... Well , let 's just say , " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - Calling officer romek . Calling officer romek . - Hey , Buddy , how 's your new partner doin ' ? - Like a veteran . - I was talkin ' to Morgan . - Officer romek 's got a really good feel for the territory , Officer orrin . - don 't be fooled , Morgan . - How do you like the desk job , orrin ? You gettin ' a real feel for that ? - Well , it has its pluses . For once I get to tell you what to do and you have to listen . - I 'm sorry , did you say somethin ' ? - We got a report of a purse snatchin' outside the Gilmore bar . You 're to proceed there immediately . Hear that , romek ? - Somebody has to protect the streets . Enjoy the paperwork , orrin . - So , this is the Gilmore district . - in the flesh . - It reminds me of the divisions on earth . The politicians always promising ' to clean em up , but never do . - hmm . Sounds like you 've been here already . Come on- - Let 's get this over with . - Where the hell do you think you 're goin ' ? Get back inside . All right , everybody . It 's that time again . You guys , against the wall ! You guys , assume the position ! - Okay . - All right . - and turn the damn music off ! It 's just like a family reunion here . All right- - On your feet . Hands on the bar . I said , on your feet- - Hands on the bar ! Thank you . Now , it seems a little lady Got separated from her purse a few minutes ago . - Hey ! - And me and officer Morgan , would like to bring about a reunion of sorts . Now , who wants to be the good citizen ? Morgan , check out the back room . - Gotcha . - You guys don 't seem to be very cooperative . What about you guys over here against the wall ... you got anything to say ? - Jane , have another . - Thanks , fredo . - Oh , yeah- - Give me some more of these . Listen , did you make these yourself ? - Yeah- - Why ? Is somethin ' wrong ? - No , no , no , no . They 're not half-Bad . - Yeah , Yolanda did you ever think about hirin' ol ' fredo out ? I could use a good meal ever once in awhile . - He doesn 't come cheap . - Let you out , haldane . - Oh , my own partner . - The truth hurts , haldane . - Come on , Estes- - Time for bed . - I want to stay up with the grown-Ups . - of course you do , But they don 't have exams this week . - Come on , Estes . I can be the mum tonight . I 'll Tuck you in . - Okay . Good night . - Good night , sweetheart . - Good night . - Good night . - You can 't really be my mom , you know ? - and why 's that ? - ' cause you 're a human , and I 'm a tarn , silly . - Well , maybe I 'll just have to have my species officially changed . - You can 't do that . You have to have a baby of your own . - Good night , sweetie . Hmm . - Good night . - How about a bedtime story ? Well , I think it 's about time for the slam ball game . Fredo , why don 't you turn on the screen . - All right- - the stingrays . - " and from that moment on , all tarns had a beautiful bone in the top of the head . And they still do today . " - I love that story . - No-No ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! - Honey , what 's the matter ? - It 's okay , sweetheart . It 's just another bad dream . - Mommy and Daddy would never let anything bad happen to you . - So , you know there 's nothing to be afraid of . - Well , we got her purse back . - Yeah , but she 's still gonna be crazy . Like they say on danai , " nothin ' worse than an empty purse . " - Did you hear that ? - Hear what ? - Come on ! Freeze- - police ! - Forget it- - He 'll be long gone ! - Is he dead ? - I 'd say that was a fair assessment . - Hey , look . He dropped a watch . - leave it for forensics . Orrin , it 's romek . We got a stiff here . - hold it . - that our man ? - If my memory serves me right . Yes , sir . - Well , then we owe your memory a big vote of thanks . You just saved us a lot of time . Romek , see if slomo can get an id from This memory fit . By the way , romek tells me you 're pretty cool out there . - to be honest , sir , I was pretty scared , sir . - Well , scared is sensible . Look- - do me a favor , will ya ? Just call me Brogan . - Yes , sir . - Initials D.C. - His friends knew him as Danny cav . - Among other things . - Everybody knew him . Small time Hood . Had his hand in everything . - Only with Danny it usually case up empty . - Same as Johnny Mueller . Two small-Time hustlers . Both killed with a light Lance . Both in a week . - So any theories ? - One thing I 've learned over the years , without facts , I wouldn 't give you two credits for anyone 's theories . You know , to me this smacks of neighborhood wars . What are you waiting for ? Go find me some facts . - most of the time , solvin' a murder on demeter is a piece of cake . It 's weird . A tarn will walk right in and say , " hey ! I just whopped my neighbor with a slam ball bat . " We follow him home and there 's the guy dead . Right on the lawn . Tarn starts cryin like a human . Five minutes later , we know all there is to know . - How 's it going , haldane ? - Oh , just terrific . Let 's see . Podly thinks we got some kinda neighborhood war and now he wants facts . - Imagine that . Well , you might get lucky . - Castle , how many times do I have tell you ? Luck has nothin to do with it . - Kay , partner . Time to round up the usual suspects . - Good luck . - right . - Hey , lieutenant ? Miss datch , " demeter news . " She 's on her way down from bay two . Uh , tell her I don 't have time . - Tell her- - I don 't know . - Tell her what a wonderful time we had at your place last night . - Uh , Morgan ? If slomo gets an I.D. On that memory fit , let me know , okay ? - Sure thing , Brogan . - Sergeant fredo ! Where 's the lieutenant ? - Uh , you just missed him . He , uh , he had to run . - I bet he did . - Officer Morgan , I have cross-Referenced your memory fit . If your recollections are to be relied upon , your suspect 's name is mas maharg . - Mas maharg ? I know that name . - Brogan- - Wait up ! - Go away , datch- - We 're in a hurry . - Two minutes ! - Journalists . Don 't you just love ' em ? - I didn 't know you cared , haldane . - I don 't . - Tell me about your serial killer . - Sorry , you lost me . - You always did have a lousy sense of direction , Brogan . So , if it 's not a serial killer , what is it ? Neighborhood wars ? - It 's police business . - Oh , don 't be stupid , Brogan . You know , it can do a lot of damage if we don 't have the full story . - You threatening ' me , datch ? - Absolutely not . But you know me , lieutenant . The word , " no " and I never have been what you call , " close friends . " - Yeah , well it 's about time you got acquainted . - Well , if you don 't mind , we 'd like to leave now . Step back . Bye-Bye . - You really have to practice telekinetics , Estes . It 's not something that you can do if you 're thinking about something else . - Come on , Estes- - don 't be lazy . You don 't want to fail your exam , do you ? - No ! - Now , watch daddy . - You see ? It requires total concentration . If you don 't give it your full attention , you 'll lose control . - See ? It 's easy . Now , you try again . - Total concentration , sweetheart . - No ! No ! - Ah ! - Oh no ! Oh ! - Ahh-Ahh ! - Oh ! - Fredo , try and stop it ! - What is it , sweetheart ? What 's the matter ? - Oh ! - Oh ! - Call the doctor , fredo . - Request emergency contact immediately . - You know , after all these years , I 'm still amazed at what people 'll do to each other . - Not as amazed as the victims . - Romek ? - Yes , lieutenant ? - You got anything maharg yet ? - Not a thing . But we 're working on it . - All right . You guys finished ? - Yeah . That 's all we need . - Bag him . - Yeah , we all die sooner or later . Yep . - Yes , sir . - a lot of people try to figure it out . Me ... I don 't bother . It 's your time or it isn 't . That 's all . He 'd be 52 tomorrow . I know because we had the same birthday . You don 't forget something ' like that . - You know the victim , sir ? - Uh-Uh- - I knew him . - Would you mind answering a few questions ? - Before I answer any questions , uh , could I have a moment with Lam ? Uh , that 's his name . - right . - Sure . Just don 't touch anything . - You 're very kind . How was the end , Lam ? Was it painful , hmm ? Because no matter how much you suffered you no good- - - Whoa-Whoa , sir ! Sir , whoa ! Whoa-Whoa ! - This is merciful compared to the way I 'm suffering now . First time in 15 years I win big at Gilmore raceway , and-And what does he do ? He-He gets himself killed , so he doesn 't have to pay me ! He doesn 't have to pay any of his clients ! - Wait a minute-Wait a minute - Wait a minute ! This guy was a bookey ? - Nah , he was a lousy bookey . But he was my friend . - It 's so good to see your face , Sally . We can 't seem to get a straight answer out of the doctor . We 're just so worried about her . - we haven 't slept since She was admitted . - It 's all right , Yolanda . The staff here are the best in the city . I just wanted to explain something to you about children in Estes ' condition . Okay , they 're facing an ENORMOUS internal struggle . A part of them can 't get away from whatever it is they 've just experienced , and a part of them desperately wants to get back to normality . That 's where I come in . The purpose of post-Trauma therapy is to help children like Estes get back on their feet . - She 's in good hands , honey . - Her telekinetics exam is at the end of the week . I don 't know if you knew that . They may be able to reschedule . I mean , I suppose I could ask them ! Oh , oh-Ho . - She 's gonna be all right . Oh . Oh . - right . John Mueller . - No known gang affiliations . - Danny cav . - Ditto on the gang affiliations . - Lam Sidney . - Etcetera , etcetera . - All three d.O.A. All three with multiple lacerations around the face , neck , and shoulders . - And what does the world of science have to say about this , Officer Carson ? - Not a lot , sir . - Huh . Well , that 's more than we got . - Well , the victims are all different species . And now that we know none of them had any connections with gangs- - - Sort of shoots down my " Neighborhood wars , " theory , huh ? - It would appear so , sir . In any case , multiple lacerations like these suggest to me crimes of obsession . If you 're trying to get rid of something that you can 't get rid of , say something from your past- - - You mutilate the memory . - I think we may be dealing with a classic serial killer . - Well , that 's another theory . All right . Let 's have one more look at the prime suspect . - Mas maharg . Long record of violent crime . No fixed abode . Presumed based in the Gilmore district . - Yeah , but we sure as hell can 't find him . - that 's not what I want to hear , romek ! I want every informant , every Petty thief , everybody 's damn mother Questioned if necessary ! This guy has got to be found ! Now , get to it ! - Uh , captain ? I 've got a suggestion . - Whatever it takes . - Iona datch , news at noon ? Well , if it isn 't my favorite lieutenant . - How you doin ' , datch ? - Oh , the polite approach . Sounds suspiciously like you kneed a favor , Brogan . - You must be part tarn . Look , I 'll cut to the Chase . You were right . It 's not neighborhood wars . We got ourselves a serial killer . - So , tell me something I don 't know . - We got a suspect . - I 'm listening . - I want his face plastered all over the news . - Oh , well I 'd really like to help you , lieutenant , but I 've just gone and gotten acquainted with word , " no . " - It 's not the time , datch . Do you want the story , or not ? - Okay , but I don 't owe you for this . You 're using me . Just like you say I use you . - Well , I 'll take that as a compliment . - don 't . - I 'm not sure if you can hear me , Estes . But I think you can . All you have to do is listen and tell me when something sounds good . Now , that 's not too tough , is it ? You 're mother tells me you like ice cream . - It 's her favorite human food . - at a place near here they just got a shipment of fizzy chip cookie dough . And if you want some , all you have to do is say so . I mean , I can be back in five minutes tops . Or you can come with me if you like . - Come on , sweetheart . You know how much you love ice cream . - why don 't you think about it , and we 'll sit here and keep you company for awhile . - Spaceport departure in one hour . In one hour . - I don 't know what romek 's been tellin ' you , but murder in demeter city is one of the most difficult crimes for us to solve . - Three men are dead , zipload . - So- - Why talk to me ? - You 'd be amazed . - You could help . You could be next . - Well , we 'd find some guy lying ' face down on his lawn . Nobody saw anything nobody heard anything . Nobody knows anything about it . - See no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil . - More or less . Only we don 't have monkeys in demeter . - You don 't need ' em . Evil is evil . - Brogan , we just got a tip . Somebody spotted maharg at a soup kitchen near the Gilmore . - Mas maharg , D.C.P.D. You 're under arrest- - Brogan ! - Freeze ! - Police ! Out of the way ! Get out of the way ! - Move- - Get out of the way ! - Ahh ! - Don 't even think about it ! - Morgan ! Tell Morgan to stop ! Hold it right there , pal . - Somebody read him his rights ! - Why bother ? - Because that 's what separates us from them . - You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be reported and used against you . - How is she ? - She 's doing just fine . Is that Estes ' doll ? - She certainly is . - I thought it might be . You know , Estes , you might be able to help me out . I think your doll wants to go home . I mean , if I was a doll this isn 't exactly the place that I would want to be . But the problem is that I don 't speak doll talk anymore . It 's been way too long . And I need someone who does and that way , I 'll know what she wants to do . Will you help me ? - She 'd be a lot happier at home , sweetheart . - In her own room . - In her own bed . - With her mommy and daddy to take care of her . I think she 'd like that , don 't you ? Well . Maybe she isn 't your doll . Maybe she belongs to some other little girl . We 'll just have to go and find her . - She 's mine . - I thought it might be . - and I thought about it . - about what , baby ? - I would like some fizzy chip Cookie dough ice cream now . - of course , honey . You can have as much as you like . - Okay , maharg . It 's just a routine question and answer session . You had ' em before . For the record , I 'm reminding that anything you say or think can be recorded and used against you in a court of law . Ready ? - Willing and able . - Okay . Name ? Date of birth ? Address ? Occupation ? How we doin ' ? - Well , I 'm having no problem reading him , lieutenant . - Good . - But , um- - - Did you have anything to do with a murder of a human named John Mueller ? Did you have anything to do with the murder of a tarn named Danny cav ? Did you have anything to do with a murder of a creon named Lam Sidney ? Okay , what 's he thinkin ' . - Well , it 's not what you 'd expect . - It rarely is . Let 's hear it . - Yes , sir . Another day , another night , another meal to cook . I just got home . The kids are crazed , I 'd normally be shook . The company will be here in an hour 's time or less , but I 'm not gonna worry , 'cause I only have to dress . Thank you for kapeck soup . Heats right up in the pack . - What the hell is that ? - Jingle . I hear it on my way to work all the time . Another day , another night , another meal- - - What does it mean ? - Well , it means he 's hungry , lieutenant . Very , very hungry . - What have you got ? - Nothing . Maharg 's a psycho all right , but we can 't prove he 's the killer . - What about the light Lance ? - Well , we gotta wait for Carson to get the analysis back , and if that 's inconclusive , unless a witness shows up we 're gonna have to let him walk . - We 'll harbor that moon when we get to it , Brogan . In the meantime , why don 't you do something that you haven 't done in awhile . Get home at a reasonable hour . - You 're home early . - I can leave if you want . - No , it 's just that , uh , I 'm not ready . - You look ready to me . - Hmmm . - I miss ' em , but I 'm glad the kids are away tonight . - mmm . I finally got Estes to talk about her nightmares to me . - that 's great- - How is she ? - Good . Her dreams are so violent . Oh , um , oh , they remind me of those old slasher movies that were outlawed on earth . - doesn 't sound like a tarn . - No ... I know . Her nightmares are-Are so specific . She doesn 't just see somebody murdered . I mean , she sees the Lance , she sees the wound , she even described the victim 's watch and-And the initials on it . Yeah- - I 've never had a case like it . - Um , what were the initials ? - I don 't know . - can you try to remember , it 's important . - Oh , um , d ... Uh , d-D-C , I think . - How the hell would Estes know that ? - What do you mean ? - The only thing that I can think of is that she 's been picking up the killer 's thoughts . Maybe even seeing through his eyes with her paramental eye . - I never heard of that . - Well , it 's rare in adults , But tarn children are more sensitive . Less interference if you know what I mean . - Let me take a look , sweetheart . - ahhh ! No-No-No ! - It 's impossible . - What ? - She 's seeing maharg . - Eighty-Eighth ? - Orrin , quick . - Where 's maharg ? - I don 't know , lieutenant . We had to release him a couple of hours ago . - What the hell for ? - Carson got the Lance analysis back . It didn 't match the one that killed the others . We had nothin to hold him on . - Okay , thanks . - No-No ! - I 'll get the nurse . - No-No ! - It 's okay , baby . It 's okay- - Take it easy . - Come back to us . Please don 't leave us again . - Drop it ! - Ugh , ugh , ugh . - You know the routine . There 's no virtue without temptation . Have you ever heard that before ? I prefer to think there 's no virtue without justice . Waste like you needs to learn there are consequences for your actions . - argh ! - Anything you say can be recorded and may be used in a court of law ! You have the right to have an attorney present ! You have the right to remain ... silent ! - How 's she doing ? - Not very well . I can 't get her to respond to anything . - I 'm sure she will . You 're doing a great job , Sally . - Yeah , well it 's not good enough . I 'll see you guys . - Come on , fellas- - Stay with me , huh ? You got to be there . - Oh , no- - What she doing here ? - Who knows ? - So , there you have it . A little tarn girl under armed guard lies in a coma at demeter city hospital . Is she in communication with the Gilmore serial killer ? Is she the witness who will solve this case ? Only time will tell . Iona datch at 13 O 'clock . This is the news at noon . - Uh-Ya . Come . - Have a minute , captain ? - No , but come in anyway . - Uh , I was wondering . Did you have a chance to look over the report about maharg 's death ? - Yeah , I 've read it . - listen . I know there 's not a lot we can do about things sometimes . I mean , I couldn 't ask for two better officers than Jane , took . But we 're never really safe , are we ? I mean , I just watched the news . - Yeah- - Okay . - Captain ? - Prepare the medical center for reception . We 've got a protective custody situation . - Uh , yes sir . - Okay ? - Thanks . - Uh , lieutenant ? Miss Datch from news at noon wants to speak with you . - Not as much as I want to speak with her . Where is she ? - Uh , I had her wait in the coffee room . - Is there somethin wrong with you ? How could you put a little girl in jeopardy like that ? - What are you talking about ? I reported a story from a tip you gave me . - I never said anything about a tarn girl . - doesn 't mean she doesn 't have anything to do with the story . You 're not my only source . - that 's what I like about you , datch . You make up your own rules . - No , Brogan . The rules have been around for light years . They 're called , " freedom of the press . " - Oh , right . You don 't know the whole story . We don 't even know if the little girl is a witness . Let me tell you something . If anything happens to that little girl- - - Is that a threat , Brogan ? - You better believe it . - Patrick Brogan , married- - Two children . You haven 't missed a house payment in over five years , but you 've been late twice though . Your credit rating is okay . Most of your neighbors thinks you keep pretty strange hours , but only one thinks it 's because you 're having an affair . - Where the hell did you get that information ? - I 'm a journalist . It 's important I know who I 'm talking to . I 've got a file on every cop in this case . Have a look at this . Go on . It-it probably is just a coincidence , I don 't know for sure yet . You see , I try not run the stories 'til I 've double checked the facts . I want you to know that . And I try to apologize when I make a mistake . Sorry about the little girl . - Datch ? If I didn 't know any better , I 'd almost think you had a conscience . - I 'll take that as a compliment . - don 't . - When This is over , you 'll have all the fizzy chip Cookie dough ice cream you could possibly want . - How you doin ' , sweetheart ? - She 's doin just great . - Jane and took have gone off duty . But there will be a guard on the door 26 hours a day . First shift will be here any moment . - Thank you , fredo . - No , thank you . - Reporting for duty , sergeant . - What 's up ? - I 'm just going down to the coffee room . Can I bring you anything ? - No , thanks- - I 'm fine . - Okay . - according to this , a year before Morgan transferred here there were five murders in his precinct . All small-Time hoods . Killer never apprehended , uh , however Morgan received a commendation from bravery . - What ? - Call up his personnel file . - Yeah . - What are you doing ? What are you doing ? No- - Stop it ! No ! - Four more Lance murders in his training precinct . All small-Time hoods . Killer never found . Morgan singled out again . - This is not a coincidence . - Romek , where 's Morgan ? - He 's on guard duty outside the medical room . - No ! - You killed all those people , didn 't you ' ? - They weren 't people . - They were just like you and me . - No- - They 're waste . - It 's locked . - Morgan ! It 's Brogan ! Unlock the door ! Morgan ! What happens now , Morgan ? - Whatever 's necessary , sir . - I want you to let her go . - I don 't think that 's necessary . - I 'll shoot . - You wouldn 't do that . We 're on the same side . - Give me the gun , Morgan . - The things that motivate me are the same things that motivate you . - there 's no way out . - How long you been a cop , Brogan ? - Let her go ! - Twenty years ? - I want you to do it now . - I 've only been a cop for three , and I already know much more than you 'll ever know . If you want to get rid of the crime , get rid of the criminals ! - It 's over , Morgan . - the funny thing is , the criminals at least know what they 're doing out there . They just don 't care . Now , cops like you , you act like you care , but you just don 't do anything to stop it ! And that 's worse ! - Hands behind your head ! Do it- - now ! Turn around- - Face the wall ! Cuff him and read him his rights ! - It 's all right , sweetheart . It 's all right . It 's all over . There 's nothing to be afraid of anymore . Your nightmare is over . - Hey , orrin ! Put that pencil down . Now , that Morgan 's out of the picture , you can get back to doin some real police work . If you still remember how . - Didn 't the captain tell ya ? Fredo is takin ' some time off to be with his daughter . I 'm acting sergeant . - Get outta here ! - Really . - Where you goin ' ? - On patrol . Somebody has to protect the streets . - What about me ? - Come on , partner- - Let 's go . - Ah , I knew you were just kiddin ' me all the time . - Castle ? What are you doin ' tonight ? I know this great soup kitchen . - Sorry , haldane . I 've already got a date with my therapool . - Okay , I 'll get the soup and I 'll meet you there . - I don 't think so . - Why do I bother to ask ? - Because one of these days you might just get lucky . - Castle , luck has nothing to do with it . - How about 8 O 'clock ? At the soup kitchen . - I 'll settle for that . - I was pretty scared , but I really concentrated hard . Just like you said . And I got an " a . " - We 're proud of you , sweetheart . But we 'd be proud of you no matter what score you got . I 'll get it . - Now , let 's open your present ! Ta-Dum ! Motionary ii . - Oh , no ! I mean , thanks . Motionary ii . - whenever you 're ready . - Hi . - Hi . - Hey , guys- - Come on in . - Oh . I brought something for you . - fredo ! - There you go . - Wow ! Fizzy Chip cookie dough . - that 's right . As much as you can eat . There 's more in mom 's freezer . I think you 'll need a spoon . Mmm . Is it as good as it looks ? - Great . - Great .

 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . Looking good , Carl . Thank you very much , Marty . Come on , push . There you go . One more . Come on . You did good . Don 't worry . Take a minute , we 'll do another set , all right ? May I ? Use the machines . I like free-weights . I 've been waiting . Let him have his turn . Next thing you know , they 'll be letting gorillas in here . Wow . You know , if they start competing , they 're gonna blow us away . All right , there . I 'll take the weight off . Don 't bother . Viktor . It 's cool . All right . Come on , two more . There you go . Easy up . Way to go . Killer . I 'm thirsty . Where do you keep this , the freezer ? They all say that . You can come in now , Mrs. Francisco . How 's my neemu ? He 's fine . I say he has about three weeks left . I feel like a whale . These stretch marks . You look very handsome . His body 's going through tremendous changes . I haven 't met a man yet who didn 't feel like a whale . Every little noise sets me on edge . I used to love the smell of tripe . Now it makes me sick . Heightened senses usually accompany the end of the first phase of incubation . It wasn 't like this with Buck or Emily . George , you know every incubation is different . You 're close to Phase 2 now , the rising of the haffacota . This is a special time . Think about the miracle that 's going on inside of you . Are you on paternity leave ? No , not yet . I 'm concerned about leaving my partner with all of the work . It would be good for you to go away . Go to the desert . Enjoy the end of your pregnancy . She 's right , you know . I can 't go because of work , but you can . You think about it . When I left Detroit , I got the phone number of one of the stewardess . What a fox . She lives in some place called Huntington Beach . Is that around here ? Yeah , not far . Don 't worry . She 's got a friend . You remember Melinda Waters , that stewardess ? Was she hot ! And her little sister ? She threw my back out . I needed traction . Well , this is where I work . Captain 's office , lock-up . Yeah . " Who loves you , baby , " huh ? " Say , just book ' em , Dano . " " Go ahead , make my day . " It 's not quite so exciting . Well , it 's better than retail . I 've only seen pictures . We don 't have any in Detroit . You get used to ' em . Here you go , pally . Here 's the car . I 'll be home around 6 : 00 . Sgt. Sikes , about George 's baby shower ... it 's not a Tenctonese tradition . I don 't know exactly what to do . Look , can we talk about that later ? But it 's this Sunday . And I want it to be nice for him . For him ? George is a guy and you 're giving him a baby shower ? George is what you 'd call pregnant . Pregnant ? He 's a Newcomer . It 's kinda complicated . Look , I 'm letting you use my apartment , but I don 't know anything about showers . I 'm sure whatever you do will be fine . Matt . Grazer wants to see us . Let me guess , you 're George . Yes , I 'm George . This is my old pal , Nick Coletta . We grew up together in Detroit . Nick 's out here visiting . This is my partner , George Francisco . You didn 't tell me you had one for a partner . And he 's pregnant . So , can I ? Feels like real skin . Matt , Grazer ? Yeah . Nick , I 'll see you tonight . Wait . Can I ? No , you may not ! Sorry , you know how women ... Men are when they 're pregnant . Sure . A pregnant Newcomer male is entitled to a paid , six-week paternity leave . Have you decided when to start yours ? How about today ? You 're really blimping up , George . Matt , I can 't just abandon you . No sweat . There are a lot of guys who could cover for you . How about it , Francisco ? I 'm still in Phase 1 . The haffacota , what you would call the fetus , is still low . I 'm perfectly capable of performing my duties . I don 't want this avocado popping up around me . I still have three weeks of incubation left . There 's nothing to worry about , partner . Look , George , we 're cops . We 're men . People are supposed to take us seriously . What he 's trying to say is , a pregnant male in our society is ... Something you will have to get used to . I intend to continue working until the second phase of my pregnancy . Have it your way . A human kid at County passed out at a gym . Blood tests show a high level of ... ( GRAZER STUTTERING ) ( SPEAKING IN TENCTONESE ) Yeah . Newcomer male hormone . Why would humans take it ? Like steroids , they 're using it to buff up . Polish themselves ? Put on muscle . The effects are worse than steroids . It can cause liver damage , arthritis , temporary psychosis . It also seems to be physically addictive . Find out who 's dealing it . When are they gonna let me out of here ? Just relax . I 've gotta train . I got a competition next week , remember ? ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Viktor Wendkos ? Yeah . I 'd like to ask you a few questions , if I may . Would you excuse us ? They 're my friends . It 's cool . Whatever . Your friends have names ? Karina Bowen . And Don Zimmer . Why ? Your blood tests showed a high level of Newcomer male hormone . We 'd like to know where you scored it . Look , I 'm through with that stuff . Good . And where 'd you get it ? Somebody at the gym ? Maybe you ought to tell them . I got it on the street , okay ? I didn 't know the guy . Yeah , sure . Look , I know you think you 've got your reasons for taking this stuff . But you 're a young guy . You mess up your body now ... that 's all you got for the rest of your life , man . I told you , I 'm through with it . Hey , officer , that a watermelon you hiding in there ? No , idiot , he 's pregnant . Oh , excuse me . Look , I catch you taking that stuff again , I 'm bringing you in . Come on , George . He 's pregnant . Most bodybuilders would never use drugs . There are a few still looking for that magic formula . It 's gotten worse now with the Newcomers here . No offense . Just that you guys are so much stronger , our guys feel like wimps . Were you aware that Viktor Wendkos was using it ? No , absolutely not . Viktor helps me manage this club , and I 'm gonna give him a chance . But if he doesn 't stay clean , he 's out of here . I 've been a health nut for over 25 years . It 's like a religion with me . I even manufacture and market my own line of vitamins and food supplements . I use these . These are great . Give you a lot of energy . Look , I 've got a diet formula that can help get rid of that old paunch . I 'm not fat , I 'm pregnant . If I find anybody dealing that stuff in this place , you 'll be the first to know . GEORGE : Is this that puffing up you were talking about ? MATT : " Buffing up . " Yeah . GEORGE : Why do they do this ? Certainly doesn 't seem pleasurable . It looks good . You know , manly . I wouldn 't mind putting a couple inches on my chest . Manly ? This distortion of the body is considered manly ? Look who 's talking . What do you call that distortion ? Bodybuilding 's good for you . But like anything else , you can overdo it . Let 's get some statements . You take that side . Let me help you with that . NICK : Man , those mud wrestlers . The redhead would 've left with me if we hadn 't got thrown out of that place . I mean , what 's the big deal ? Nick , I warned you about getting in the ring with them . Listen , what do you say we have a little drink , then I 'll call that stewardess ? It 's 2 : 00 in the morning . I gotta work tomorrow . You 'll be fine . You don 't need to sleep . Just take a hot shower in the morning . I know I saw a bottle of Scotch around here . Here we go . None for me . Matt , you used to be such a fun guy . I mean , I don 't know anymore . I met the Newcomer neighbor today . Cathy , right ? Right . She likes you . Seems real friendly . So , you score with her ? What ? Did you have sex with her ? No . Come on . No . Don 't you want to ? Look , I 'm tired . Once you get by that spotty head , she 's got a great body . If she was my neighbor , I 'd be all over her . And I do mean , all over her . I 'm gonna brush my teeth . Matt . Captain Grazer has just given us a new case . It seems a gambling ring is operating out of palach clubs . We already got a case . According to Captain Grazer , it 's no longer a priority . Viktor Wendkos made a full recovery . Seems to be an isolated incident . You can start on the gambling thing . I 'm not dropping our case . Why is it so important to you ? I feel for these guys . I used to play football with them . Football ? They 're much younger than you are . Guys like them . They 'd go into a game their knee shot full of Novocain and cortisone . They could have been seriously injured . Why would they do that ? It 's this thing we got , George , about being a man . It starts the day you 're born . Excuse me , Sgt. Sikes , what color napkins should I get for the shower ? I don 't know . It 's your shower , what do you want ? I like maroon , or beige . Beige . Matt . I 'm not sure I understand your concept of being a man . It 's solely a matter of gender . Not on this planet . You gotta prove it here . Like some Newcomer men . They don 't feel truly masculine until after they 've given birth . I 'm afraid , George , that giving birth doesn 't quite cut it . You ever see movies ? Remember Sylvester Stallone ? That beefy fellow with the headband , always had a big gun ? Remember that scene in First Blood when Stallone falls off a cliff ? He has this huge gash in his arm and he sews himself up . See , that 's considered being a man . Tell you the truth , Matt , I find his movies simplistic . Why does everything have to be so complicated with you ? You think too much . Women do that . The hormone is a complex protein . Like insulin , it is possible to synthesize it . But it would require very sophisticated equipment . The simplest way to extract the hormone ... would be to get it from male Newcomer blood . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) So , I 'm looking for a source of Newcomer blood . Yes . Excuse me . Hello , Nick . Thanks for the sugar . I wanted to return your cup . Thank you . Hey , Matt . What 're you doing ? I decided to bake a cake and you didn 't have any sugar . You baked a cake ? Yeah . It 's a very old family recipe . Nick 's great-great-grandmother brought it all the way across the plains . How sweet . Cathy , I was just wondering if you weren 't busy on Saturday night ... if you 'd like to have dinner with me ? Dinner ? Well ... You don 't mind , do you , Matt ? No , why should I mind ? I 'd love to have dinner with you . Great . My back is killing me . Ankles are swollen . I have this awful ringing in my ears . Funny , so do I. You wanted the kid , stop bitching . I shouldn 't expect you to sympathize . You don 't have to get up five times a night to urinate . You have no understanding of what I 'm going through . ( CRYING ) You think men should fall off cliffs and sew themselves up . George , don 't cry . I hate it when you cry . I suppose it 's not manly , either . It 's just these hormones or whatever running wild . That 's all this is . Look , I didn 't mean it . I 'm sorry . Here , wipe your nose . I don 't need it . Don 't worry , you won 't see any more tears out of me . George , I 'm sorry . I 'm in a bad mood . I thought Nick , my old pal , came out to see me . What does he do ? He goes and makes a date with Cathy . Nick 's going out with Cathy ? She knows he 's my friend . How does that make me feel ? Did you tell her you were upset ? No . If she doesn 't know already , I 'm not going to tell her . You don 't know if she knows , but if she doesn 't , you 're not going to tell her ? Exactly . I 've been cross-referencing a bunch of old reports ... trying to find a source for that Newcomer hormone . Three months ago , this hospital reported the theft ... of a dozen pints of Newcomer blood . Better check it out . If you 're not feeling too good , maybe you ought to stay here . Of course , I 'm coming . You 're something , George . One minute it 's Little Nell , the next , it 's Conan the Barbarian . I come in , I see the units are gone . I say to myself , " Sol ... " " what kind of a gonif steals blood ? " But you know . You 're from California , all the meshugganahs . Nothing surprises you . Meshugganahs ? You got your devil worshippers , holistic this , holistic that . Here are the donors of the missing blood . When are you due ? About two and a half weeks . Your first ? No , I have a boy and a girl . The family . It 's the only thing that matters . John Adams , Ramon Navarro . It was all male blood . Wouldn 't surprise me if some schlemiel is out there drinking it . Could you get us a list of all the employees who have had access ... to this blood all in the last year . Why not ? I got something better to do with my time ? I tell my wife , we should move to Florida . You got the palm trees , you got the sun , you got the pompano . That 's a very good fish . Buck ! Buck ! What , dad ? Are you okay ? Hand me that magazine . Sure . Thank you . Do you want some Vaseline for your frog legs ? No . When did your mother say she was coming home ? Remember she had that late meeting in Century City ... and then she had to go to a dinner . Dinner ? Why couldn 't she have dinner here ? Because she was taking out a big client . You know , the human who owns all those airlines , the guy everybody hates . I suppose he 's more important than the family . Hi , Mom . Hi , Buck . Hi . Neemu , hard day at the office ? No , it was wonderful . I couldn 't have asked for a better day . You 're never gonna believe who I had dinner with . One of the most influential humans in the United States . Yes , Buck told me . Neemu , my feet hurt . Could you massage them ? Of course , George . I 'm sorry , I get so caught up with work , I forget that you 've changed . Changed ? It 's not your fault . You 're just more dependent , more needy right now . Needy ? You just can 't do all the things you 're used to doing . Things tend to upset you more . Don 't tell me how I feel . You make it sound as though I 'm some weak , helpless female . Females aren 't weak and helpless , George . If I wanted I could fall off a cliff and sew myself up . George , have you had your lead supplements today ? George , what is it ? Your haffacota just rose . No , it 's just gas . George , you 're in Phase 2 . You better call and tell them you can 't come into work . I feel fine , and I 'm not taking paternity leave until I absolutely have to . Morning . We got the employee list from the hospital . George , your avocado . What ? It looks different . It 's way up there . I don 't think so . Did you find anything ? Yeah . Viktor Wendkos ' friend , the guy we met at the hospital , Don Zimmer . Up until two months ago , he worked as a tech in the blood bank . He 's now working part-time for a contractor . George , your haffacota . You 're in Phase 2 . I am not . It 's a good thing your shower 's Sunday . I still have two and a half weeks . Let 's go see Mr. Zimmer . George , you heard what Albert said . I think you ought to sit this one out . I am sick and tired of people patronizing me . I may be pregnant , but I 'm still a man . Even if I have to prove it . Zimmer , he 's over there . George , take that side . Okay , here 's the Newcomer hormone we found at Don Zimmer 's apartment . Have SID go over it , see if they can give us any idea where it 's being made . Right . I still don 't get it . Zimmer 's a human , how could he have outrun you ? He 's very fast . He 's an athlete . You sure it didn 't have anything to do with you being in the family way ? Is that a reference to my pregnancy ? Just asking . Maybe my pregnancy did get in the way . Maybe I was only as fast as a human . Not as fast as Zimmer . So , tell me , Cathy ... have you ever had a human boyfriend ? No . Do you ever get curious ? Sometimes . Has anybody ever told you ... you have the most beautiful lips . Thank you . I 'd love to kiss them . I wish that you wouldn 't . Come on , you 're curious . I think that it 's time for you to go . Come on , baby . No , please don 't . Come on . Please . Matt ! Cathy , are you okay ? Matt please help me . Hey , guy . Oh , Matt . Cathy . Matt ? What are you doing ? Yeah , man , what 's up ? I thought I heard rats . I was just checking . Rats ? Yeah . You know , if you see one ... You know , you got a real problem . And I definitely saw droppings in the laundry room . I think we 'll be okay . Thanks , Matt . Nick and I were going to have a drink . Would you like to join us ? No , I 'm pretty tired . Make sure that you don 't keep Nick out too late . We got George 's shower tomorrow . Night , pally . Yeah , right . Goodnight , Matt . It 's twins ? Silly , no . Just one . A girl . It 's a big girl . Neemu , we better open your gifts . I 've to get to the office . It 's Sunday . I wouldn 't be all day . Albert , these are Halloween decorations . Aren 't they colorful ? It 's a baby shower . And the flamingos , they 're supposed to be storks . I thought these were prettier . Sgt. Rankin . Albert . Nice party , Matt . Kinda weird , but nice . Want one ? You 're awfully peppy today . Am I ? For someone who didn 't sleep much . You know me . What time did you get in ? I don 't know . 3 : 00 , 4 : 00 , 5 : 00 , 6 : 00 . This isn 't a hotel , Nick . Cathy needs another soda . Thank you . Sergeant . Oh , Albert . From the boys at the ballistics lab . They 're probably laughing at me behind their backs . Susan , why don 't we go home and open the rest of these later . This one 's from the SWAT team . How 're we doing ? Neemu , I 've got to go . Albert , it was a wonderful shower . Thank you . You 're welcome . Goodbye , everybody . Don 't let him eat too much cake . Okay . Bye bye . That 's beautiful . An eyelet cable stitch . That 's hard . Oh , really ? My uncle , he was in the merchant marine , and he used to knit his own socks . He kinda taught me how to knit when I was a kid . Matt , did you knit something for the baby ? Matt , are you gonna knit something for the baby ? Very funny . Men don 't knit . But , you just told me that your uncle ... Never mind . George , this is from me . Open it up . George , open it . " I 'm not fat , I 'm pregnant . " It 's okay . It wasn 't expensive . ( CRYING ) You all think this is so funny . I 've had enough . It 's just a T-shirt , George . You can return it . Go ahead , make fun of me . But I 'm leaving . I will not be humiliated . Don 't touch me . Thank you all for the lovely party . Did you enjoy your stay ? Oh yeah , it was a real eye opener . Albert , that 's stuff 's getting ripe . It does smell good . Too bad there 's so much of it left over . Sgt. Sikes , do you want me to save you some ? Take it , Albert . So , you and Cathy seemed to enjoy the party . I don 't think George did . You two are real cozy now , I guess . You 're in a rotten mood . Guess it was chasing all those rats all night . Just one rat . I borrowed these . I promised to bring them back . Matt , now , go ahead , ask me . You 've been dying to all day . So , anyway , Sgt. Sikes , thanks . Ask you what ? See you at the station . You know . Go ahead , ask me . Bye . Okay , what 'd you and Cathy do last night ? None of your business . Thanks . Thanks a lot . If you didn 't want me to go out with her , why don 't you just tell me ? She was standing right there . How the hell could I ? So , you do have a thing for her . Listen , why are you laying all this on me ? Cathy 's great . If you like her , just tell her . You gonna take me to the airport or should I call a cab ? No , I 'll take you . MATT : Have you tried to get to the airport lately , George ? Can 't believe the traffic . So , we get an SID report on the dope from Zimmer 's apartment yet ? Don Zimmer , the guy dealing Newcomer hormone , remember ? George , if this is about that T-shirt , I said I was sorry . Albert , would you tell Sgt. Sikes that it is much more than just the T-shirt . Sgt. Sikes , it 's much more ... I heard him ! Tell Sgt. Francisco , he can stick his head in a bucket . George , he said that you can ... Hey , Sikes . What 's this SID report on Newcomer male hormone ? I 've been looking for that . I told your partner , this is not a priority . Matt . Albert , is somebody speaking ? It was George . Matt , what 's in the report ? SID found traces on the vials of serum . B complex , Niacin , Sodium ascorbate . The man who owns the gym , Marty Penn . He manufactures vitamins . He could produce the hormone at his factory . Let 's go visit Mr. Penn . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) I hate when this happens . Matt . It 's Penn . He has a faint pulse . This is one-William-152 . We need an ambulance at 4673 Sunset Heights Boulevard , apartment 1204 . What the hell did he get hit with ? I can 't be sure , but I 'd say it 's someone 's fist . That kind of damage . Was it a Newcomer ? Maybe , or a human as strong as one . Marty Penn 's in a coma . He is not gonna be fingering anybody real soon . Obviously , whoever hit him was real strong . Drugs were taken . We know Zimmer was dealing . Maybe he was using , too . I feel awful . Phase 3 ? No . Matt , if it was Don Zimmer , I 'm responsible . When we went to arrest him , I had a pouch spasm . I couldn 't follow . That 's why he got away . Is one of you Detective Sikes ? Yeah . Your watch commander . Sikes . Yeah , thanks . You 're off the hook , George . Phoenix PD picked up Zimmer last night on our APB . Docs figure that Penn was assaulted between 12 : 00 midnight and 3 : 00 a.m. Zimmer couldn 't have done it . He was in Arizona . The only other person involved with the hormone is Don Zimmer 's friend ... Viktor Wendkos . Yeah . And you heard what Grazer says . The stuff causes personality changes , psychosis . It 's also addictive , and you know how junkies are when they need a fix . Come on . Matt , I don 't think I should . Look , George , maybe you are only functioning at human capacity . That 's good enough for me . I don 't know when he 'll be back . Where was he between midnight and 3 : 00 am ? I don 't know . Lots of times he stays at the gym after he closes up . Lately , he 's been staying all night . All night ? Yeah . At first I thought he was seeing someone else but ... No way , Jose . What makes you so sure ? Let 's just say the muscle-man act ends between the sheets . I 'm sorry , I don 't follow you . He can 't perform . You mean he can 't sustain an erection ? Yeah , George , that 's just what she means . He 's impotent . I think I know the reason why . The same thing happens with steroids . Your boyfriend 's back on the stuff . Yeah , I thought so . He 's been acting so weird lately . He 's been like a different person . And when I try to talk to him about it , he just gets so angry . Especially when we 're in bed and he can 't ... You know . Viktor hit me yesterday and he 's never hit me before . You think we could find Viktor at the gym right now ? I 'm sure you could . Since we stopped sleeping together , that 's about all he does . MATT : That beating Viktor gave Penn , it wasn 't just to steal the hormone . It was payback . Payback ? He 's impotent , George . He might as well be dead . Why is impotence such a terrible thing ? Why ? Because you 're not a man . What are you ? Of course , you 're still a man but , you 're just not a man . I hate getting in these conversations with you . It 's ironic . In searching for manhood , he lost it . You humans sure have strange ideas about what 's male and female . We have strange ideas ? You make such a separation of the two . Because they 're different , George . Of course they 're different , but aren 't they two parts of the same person ? We 're made of man and woman , aren 't we then both male and female ? Maybe you are . We both have a feminine side . Matt , I 've been so stupid ... I 've been trying to conform to your human ideals of masculinity . In denying my femininity , my incubation , I have denied myself . Well , look , George , maybe things are a little more complicated for you . I don 't think so . Viktor Wendkos , Police ! We want to talk to you . Call for backup . This if one-William-152 . We need backup at Penn 's Gym , Redondo and Olympic . ( CRASHING ) Stay here , George . Wait for backup . I don 't want him getting out the back door . Then I 'm going with you . No . See if you can find some lights . Freeze ! Come on , Slag . Matt . Matt . Vessna . I got him , George . Rambo 's got nothing on you , George . You can thank my feminine side . I was protecting my baby . This is one-Wllliam-152 . Where the hell 's my backup ? And while you 're at it , send an ambulance . Roger . Get two . No , I 'm okay . For me . I 'm having the baby . No , George , you can 't . You 're still in Phase 2 . It 's disattaching . George , you told me . You said you 'd have two weeks left . This isn 't supposed to happen . You said you still got two weeks . The fight , it 's brought on premature labor . This is one-William-152 . I also need another ambulance stat for a delivering Newcomer . The patient is a police officer . Get it here immediately . Roger . They 'll never make it . I 'll get you to that birthing center . You 're going to have to deliver the baby . Come on , me ? George , please . Get me there . Why are you doing this to me ? You know I didn 't want this to happen . You promised me , George . George , just try to hold it in . I can 't . Undo my pants . Now what ? Place your hands , here . Help me push . George ? Push . You hang in there , all right . Put your fists against my temples . It helps to dilate the pouch . It 's coming . Now ? It 's coming . What do I do ? Push . Breathe . I 'm okay . All right . Push . ( GEORGE SCREAMING ) What ? She 's nabarote . What 's that ? Breeched . Oh , man . She can 't get out . What can I do ? What do I do ? George , tell me . George , don 't you check out on me . Turn the baby around . George . Turn the baby around . It 's okay , George . It 's all right . It 's gonna be okay . Here we go . She 's coming now . ( BABY CRYING ) Matt , turn her face up , please . George , she 's beautiful . Vessna . She has Susan 's spots . She 's cold . She needs the comfort of two bodies . Her mother isn 't here . Matt , lie close to us . Vessna , I want you to meet your godfather . MATT : Purl one , knit two . That 's called a cluster rib stitch . Now , I 'll do a pearl stitch , okay . Yarn forward . All right ? And reverse it . Slip down . Wrap it around . Slip it off . Now what ? Just repeat till the end of the row . Cathy ? I like you .

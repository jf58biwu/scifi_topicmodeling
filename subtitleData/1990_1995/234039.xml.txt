 Once when she was a girl , a very little girl , Dana was in the woods . It was autumn . She had always been a tom boy , unlike her sister , Melissa . For her birthday , Dana 's brothers had given her a BB gun ... and were showing her how to use it . The father had told them only to shoot at cans . But in a patch of grass , Bill Jr. found a garter snake . And the boys began shooting . Wanting to fit in with her brothers , Dana also shot at the snake . It squirmed wildly , desperately fighting for life , but as the boys continued to shoot , the snake began to bleed . When she realized what she had done , Dana began to cry with irrevocable guilt . Through her tears she was saying that ... something was missing from the snake . She had taken something that was not hers to take . And although deathly afraid of snakes , Dana held the animals if ... sheer human will could keep it alive . The snake , its blood on her hands , died . There was nothing she could do to bring it back . It 's too soon , Mrs. Scully . We can 't give up . That day in the woods , I felt for my daughter . But at this moment , I know how my daughter felt . We should stop . Sir . Sir , you can 't go in there ! Well , what would you recommend ? - Who brought her here ? How did she get here ? - Sir , will you please ... - How did she get here ? - Ms. Scully was in this condition when I arrived for the evening . - If you step outside , perhaps Dr. Daly may ... - Is that Daly ? Are you Dr. Daly ? What the hell is going on ? How did she get here ? - Would you settle down ? - Was it paramedics ? F.B.I. ? Military ? - I can 't answer that . I was just assigned to her . - Answer me right now ! - What ? You 're telling me she just appeared ? - Sir ... - Who did this to her ? I want to see her admission forms ! - Sir ! Who did this to her ? And I want to see what tests have been done ! Listen , if you are with them , if you 're hiding anything , I swear I will do anything ! Whatever it takes , I 'll find out what they did to her ! Presently we have Dana listed in critical condition . Comatose . There is complete unawareness of self or environment . There is no evidence of language comprehension . No evidence of voluntary responses to external stimuli . My apologies , but , uh , no one here ... can determine how Dana arrived at the hospital , administered or how she was attended to in such a critical condition . Um , because of the absence of Dana 's recent medical history , I 'm at a loss for prognosis . I can 't determine , with certainty , how long she 's been in this state . You haven 't told us why she 's like this . We just don 't know , Mrs. Scully . There are no indications of a cute injuries , traumatic or non-traumatic . I can 't find any signs of degenerative or metabolic disorders . We have conducted every test possible . I 'd like her examined for trace evidence . Uh , she 's been bathed and cleaned since her admittance . Also , there is , uh , a situation which I don 't know if you 're aware of . The F.B.I. has notified us of the terms of Dana 's living will . What is it ? What did she say ? Well , Dana is a doctor . Her criteria for terminating life support is quite specific . She states that , um , if her Glascow Outcome Scale lists her ... She doesn 't want to live in this condition . You 've signed the will as her witness . I 've been told not to call you Fox . - By who ? - Dana . Just now . Dana talked to you just now ? If she talked , the E.E.G. would have moved . Her soul is here . Hi , Mom . I 'm glad you could come , Melissa . You 're Scully 's sister ? Dana 's choosing whether ... whether to remain or move on . You can feel her . Here . She 's not here . Your anger , your fear 's blocking any positive emotion she needs to feel . I need to do more than just wave my hands in the air . Male , nonsmoker . May I help you ? Dana Scully , please . Frohike ? Mr. Fenley to radiology . Mr. Fenley to radiology . Hey , Mulder . This is weird . - Good work sneakin ' out these charts . - Tucked ' em in my pants . There 's plenty of room down there . You look down , Mulder . Tell ya what . You 're welcome to come over Saturday night . We 're hoppin ' on the Internet to nitpick the scientific inaccuracies of Earth 2 . I 'm doin ' my laundry . The chart shows abnormal protein chains in the blood . The amino acid sequence is in a combination that I 've never seen before . I downloaded Scully 's medical data to the newest lone gunman . He goes by the name " The Thinker " . - This guy 's a hacking genius . - What ? - The Thinker reports the protein chains ... are the by-products of branched DNA . - Branched DNA ? - The cutting edge of genetic engineering . Uh , the biological equivalent of a silicon microchip . This is way beyond cutting edge . This is technology 50 years down the line . - What 's it used for ? - Could be a tracking system . The developmental stages of a biological marker . You mean a high-tech identity card ? Or something as insidious as grafting a human to something ... inhuman . Good theories , gentlemen , but all for naught . This branch DNA is inactive . It 's waste product . Whoever was experimenting on Scully is finished . Now it 's nothing more than a biological poison . Will she live ? Um , her immune system has been decimated , and , uh , I doubt even ... a healthy human body has the ability to fight this . Mulder , there 's nothing you can do . Dana ? Dana , honey ? I know you can hear me . This is Nurse Owens . I 'm here to take care of you , sweet heart . Watch over you , help you find the way home . I know you 're far away from home tonight ... and that where you are is peaceful . It 'd be nice to stay , but Dana , you must leave here only when it 's time . I 'll be here when you need me , dear . Excuse me , sir . I have to take some blood . - Code blue ! Crash cart ! - Crash cart coming in ! Let 's get an airway in ! B.P. , 80 over 60 . Dropping . Allright . Let 's shock her . Give me the paddles . - Two hundred joules . Clear ? What do we got ? - Clear . - Got a catheterin . - Dropping 80 over ... - Let 's go again . 260 . Clear ? - Clear . Hey ! I didn 't expect you here till after visiting hours . - There was a man . He took Scully 's blood . He ... - Forget him ! - Get that gun out of my face ! - This high-capacity compact Sig-Sauer 40-caliber weapon ... is pointed at your head to stress my insistence ... that your search for who put your partner on that respirator desist immediately ! You ignore my call for help and then you expect me to do what you say ? You go to hell ! You got him killed ! You got her killed . That 's not going to happen to me . You 're my tool . You understand ? I come to you when I need you . Right now you 're heading in a direction that can lead them right here . What the hell are you talking about ? You 're not supposed to know . That 's the point . I owe her more than just sitting around doing nothing . She was a good solider , Mulder , but there is nothing you can do to bring her back . - She 's not dead . - Listen to you . Listen . You 're a damn school boy , Mulder . You have no idea , no idea ! Okay , then tell me . Tell me ! I used to be you . I was where you are now , but you 're not me , Mulder . I don 't think you have the heart . Walk away . Grieve for Scully ... and then never look back . You will be able to live with yourself , Mulder , on the day you die . Federal agent ! Federal agent . You know I 'm armed . Don 't turn around . Put your gun very slowly on the ground . Put your hands behind your head . Interlock your fingers . Turn right towards the machine and put your head on it . Face me . Who wants this ? Who wants it ? All right . Let 's go . This way . Stay there . Wait ! You want to see what it takes to find the truth , Agent Mulder ? You want to know the things I know ? I 'll attend to this . Discontinuing the respirator does not necessarily mean ... pulling the plug and ending her life . Karen Ann Quinlan lived for nine years ... after cessation of mechanical ventilation . I do believe , however , that this is not the case with your daughter , Mrs. Scully . My guess is that she 's been in this state since her disappearance , and she will not improve . - Is she below the criteria established in her will ? - Yeah . It 's possible branched DNA can be treated with designer antibiotics . Agent Mulder , I don 't know where you 've developed this bizarre diagnosis , but I do believe you 're in no position to continue here . You 've never provided an answer as to why she 's here or what 's wrong with her . - We need to study her . - She 's not a piece of evidence . She 's here because of unnatural circumstances . She 's dying . That 's perfectly natural . We hide people in these rooms because we don 't want to look at death . We have machines prolong a life that should end . That 's a much more unnatural circumstance than any cause of her death . That is very politically correct . That 's very human . I love her . And this is right . Dana has made our decision . Fox ? You and Dana had a friendship built on respect . Now in the last year , I have lost my husband , and God knows , I don 't want to lose my baby girl . But like you , I have always respected her . Fox , this is a moment for the family , but you can join us , if you want . Read it . It 's all there . If you 're having trouble sitting on Mulder , Assistant Director Skinner , - I 'm sure you know we 'd have no trouble . - Uh-uh . - Yeah , come in . Sit down . I called you up here because of rumors about an incident at the hospital last night . Is this about the tooth that was found in the cafeteria Jell-O ? - The rumor has it that you were involved in the laundry room ? - No , sir . - A man was executed , Agent Mulder . - I was with Scully . - Traces of her blood were found at the scene . - May I see the police report ? There is no police report of this incident , and there is no body . Since I am unfamiliar with any such incidents , sir , no . How would I know that ? - Knock it off ! - How does it feel ? Constant denial of everything , questions answered with a question . I want to know what happened , damn it ! Him . That 's what happened . Cancer Man . He 's responsible for what happened to Scully ! - How do you know that ? - It 's a rumor . Who is he ? - It 's not your ... - Oh , you can have it all ! You can have my badge . You can have the X-Files . Just tell me where he is . And then what ? He sleeps with the fishes ? We 're not the Mafia , Mulder . I know it 's easy to forget , but we work for the Department of Justice . That 's what I want . Agent Scully was a fine officer . More than that , I liked her . I respected her . We all know the field we play in and we all know what can happen in the course of a game . If you were unprepared for all the potentials , then you shouldn 't step on the field . What if I ... I knew the potential consequences , but I ... I never told her ? Then you 're as much to blame for her condition as ... the Cancer Man . Hello , Starbuck . It 's Ahab . People would say to me , " Life is short . Kids , they grow up fast . Before you know it , it 's over " . I never listened . To me , life went at a proper pace . There were many rewards ... until the moment that ... I knew , I understood that ... I would never see you again . My little girl . Then my life felt as if it had been the length of one breath , one heartbeat . I never knew how much I loved my daughter ... until I could never tell her . At that moment , I would have traded every medal , every commendation , every promotion ... for just one more second with you . We 'll be together again , Starbuck . But not now . Soon . - Dana ? I know death is at arms reach tonight . But Dana , your time is not over . You know , Fox ... Sorry . Mulder . You could spend the rest of your life finding every person who 's responsible , and it 's still not gonna bring her back . Whoever did this to her has an equal horror coming to them . - Including myself ? - Pardon me . Sir , do you have change for the cigarette machine ? No . Sorry , I don 't . What do you mean , yourself ? There 's a pack already here . Morleys . Not my brand . Cigarette break ? How about smoke ? Sit down ! - How 'd you find me ? - Shut up ! Tonight I ask the questions , and you 're gonna answer me , you son of a bitch ! Don 't try and threaten me , Mulder . I 've watched presidents die . Why her ? Why her and not me ? Answer me ! I like you . I like her too . That 's why she was returned to you . You should be the one to die . Why ? Look at me . No wife . No family . Some power . I 'm in the game because I believe what I 'm doing is right . Right ? Who are you to decide what 's right ? Who are you ? If people were to know of the things that I know , it would all fall apart . I told Skinner you shot the man in the hospital , but I didn 't really believe it . And here you are with a gun to my head . I have more respect for you , Mulder . You 're becoming a player . You can kill me now , but you 'll never know the truth . And that 's why I 'll win . Don 't worry . This 'll be our secret . We wouldn 't want others to ... start rumors . When I started out , this room was where they kept the copier . At least back then it wasn 't just wasted space . It 's unacceptable . Look , I know you feel responsible for Agent Scully , but I will not accept resignation and defeat as self-punishment . All the forensics , the field investigations , the eye witness accounts , to still know nothing . To lose myself ... and Scully . I hate what I 've become . When I was 18 , I , uh , I went to Vietnam . I wasn 't drafted , Mulder . I enlisted in the Marine Corps the day of my 18th birthday . I did it on a blind faith . I did it because I believed that it was the right thing to do . I don 't know . Maybe I still do . Three months into my tour , a ten-year-old North Vietnamese boy walked into camp covered with grenades . And I , uh , I blew his head off ... from a distance of ten yards . I lost my faith . Not in my country or in myself , but in everything . There was just no point to anything anymore . One night on patrol , we were , uh , caught . And everyone ... everyone fell . Everyone . I looked down at my body ... from outside of it . I didn 't recognize it at first . I watched the V.C. strip my uniform , take my weapon . And I remained ... in this thick jungle . Peaceful . Unafraid . Watching my dead friends . Watching myself . In the morning , the corps men arrived and put me in a body bag until ... I guess they found a pulse . I don 't know . I woke in a Saigon hospital two weeks later . I 'm afraid to look any further beyond that experience . You ? You are not . Your resignation is unacceptable . You . You gave me Cancer Man 's location . You put your life in danger . Agent Mulder , every life , every day ... is in danger . That 's just life . Your plane ticket . - But we barely know each other . - I can 't tell you why she was taken . It 's too close to me . I 'm giving you the men who took her . - How ? - They believe you 'll be out of town . They believe you have information about Scully ... being kept in your desk in your apartment . At 8 : 17 tonight , they 'll search your apartment . They will be armed . You will be waiting . - Waiting ? - To defend yourself with terminal intensity . It 's the only way , Mulder . The law will not punish these people . After tonight , we cannot make contact for several weeks . Mulder . Sorry . I came by . You weren 't answering . Your machine wasn 't on . Can I come in ? For a second ? - Why is it so dark in here ? - ' Cause the lights aren 't on . Okay . I just came from the hospital . Dr. Daly says ... she 's weakening . It could be any time , so I figured you 'd want to come down and see her . - Well , I can 't . - Well , I 'd think that you would . Yeah , I would . I can 't . Not right now . Listen . I don 't have to be psychic to see that you 're in a very dark place , much darker than where my sister is . Willingly walking deeper into darkness cannot help her at all . - Only the light will ... - Oh , enough with the harmonic convergence crap . You 're not saying anything to me . Why don 't you just drop your cynicism and your paranoia and your defeat ? You know , just because it 's positive and good doesn 't make it silly or trite . Why ... Why is it so much easier for you to run around ... trying to get even than just expressing to her how you feel ? I expect more from you . Dana expects more . Even if it doesn 't bring her back , at least she 'll know , and so will you . I.C.U. Yes , that was two units . Thank you . I feel , Scully , that ... You believe you 're not ready to go . And you 've always had the strength of your beliefs . I don 't know if my being here ... will help bring you back . But I 'm here . I 'm afraid in this case ... Let me check the chart . Call Dr. Daly . Now . Hello , this is Fox Mulder . Leave a message please . I 'm here . - Hello , Fox . - Not Fox . Mulder . How ya feelin ' ? I really don 't remember anything ... after Duane Barry . Doesn 't ... Doesn 't matter . I brought you a present . The Super Stars of the Super Bowls . I knew there was a reason to live . Now you want to get some rest . I ... I just came by to see how you 're doing and say hi . Mulder ? I had the strength of your beliefs . I was holding this for you . Can I see Nurse Owens ? I 've got something I 'd like her to have . Nurse who ? Owens . Short with straight , light brown hair . She watched over me in intensive care , and I 'd like to thank her . Dana , I 've worked here for ten years , and there 's no Nurse Owens at this hospital .

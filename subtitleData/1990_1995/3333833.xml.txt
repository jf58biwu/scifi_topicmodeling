 A hush falls over the crowd as " Doomsday " Donnelly faces off against his archenemy " Groin Pull " Parker . The two warriors size each other up searching for signs of weakness . Searching , searching ... " Groin Pull " makes his move . " Doomsday " down ! Come on , it 's six inches between you and destiny ! You know the reversal . Use it ! - You can take this guy . - ( Sighs ) - ( Blows Whistle ) - GARY : Yeah ! - ( Cheering ) - Way to go , Macho man . ( Grunts ) So I lost . Big deal . You could have taken him . You didn 't even try . It 's just gym class . You forget that gym class is a spectator sport . Hello ? Hello ? - VOICE : Hello , Chett . - CHETT : Mom ? VOICE : I realize this tape may seem a little odd but ever since we discussed your helping out around the house you 've all but disappeared . I figured this was my only hope of reaching you . - You are one desperate mom . - Feel free to pick any household chore from this chore : clean out the garage ... - In your dreams . - paint the lanai ... - Kiss my butt . - or keep the raccoons from - digging up my rose bushes . - Hmm ... masked invaders . Should you choose to go after the raccoons remember : be humane . ( Laughs ) Humane . Good one . ( Laughs ) You should have seen him . You heard of the shag attack ? We had a Wyatt wimp-out . " If I play dead , maybe he 'll go away . " So I 'm not a hyp I don 't pick on you when you wuss out in physics . He 's right . We can 't all be superstar athletes . If he can 't handle wrestling how does he expect to handle the real world ? We have gym class to develop that killer edge . - I 'm happy the way I am . - I 'm your friend , Wy . I only want what 's best for you . Can 't you build him a better backbone or something ? I 've got a better idea . Perfume . That will give him an edge . Not perfume . Cologne . Aggression ? " Warning : the surgeon general has determined that the overuse of this product may be hazardous to your health . " Yes . You have to be very careful with this , Wyatt . One spritz a day , no more , and you 'll be more assertive in no time . - Really ? - Trust me . It 's concentrated " killer edge . " Don 't think about it . Just do it ! I don 't know . I 'm not sure I need this stuff . Remember we 're not alone . Come to daddy . Oh ! If there 's a dog in heat within 100 miles we 'll find out soon . - MAN : Okay , boys , hit the mat . - Go get them , Bad boy . ( Blows Whistle ) ( Grunts ) Yeah ! Come on , Wyatt ! ( Blows Whistle ) ( Blows Whistle ) - ( Blows Whistle ) - Whoo ! ( Whistle Blows ) - ( Whistle Blows ) - ( Cheering ) All right . I got to hand it to Lisa . That stinks juice really works . You were amazing out here . Did you see me ? I have the killer edge . And one deep shagback I feel like a new man . I got all this energy like I 've been plugged in . Just hope your stench doesn 't keep the chicks away - or your jerky breath . - I need your quarters . - Mr. Burbidge is coming . - Huh ? - And he 's got quarters . - ( Coins Jingling ) - You heard what ? - Mr. Burbidge . I see you 're growing a football team there . Eleven on each side . Ah , puberty . The tumultous changes one 's body endures . I realize it may seem you 're growing up one hair at a time but that 's nature 's grand design . When I was your age my arms were as slick as a bullfrog 's belly . This frog grew hair . You will too . Yeah ? Good God ! That was classic . You completely freaked Mr. Burbidge out . You 're growing hair where no man 's grown before . ( Sniffing ) Women- - 10 : 00 . What do you say we double-date cheerleaders friday night ? Sure , and after that we can build a staircase of cheese and walk to the moon . I 'm going for it . That scent . You smell incredible . I could lose myself downwind of you . Uh , you gotta excuse he 's been sucking back jerky all morning . The shampoo you use . It 's herbal , isn 't it ? I like that . No freaky chemicals . No animal testing . You 're conscientious and still have great-looking hair . - Thanks . - Do we know you guys ? Not yet . I 'm Wyatt . This is Gary . Would you like to double-date tomorrow night ? - Nothing fancy . - Yeah , okay . Okay , it 's date then . We 'll call you . Bye . You know , for a guy who smells like a litter box you sure can score . Oh , roses look the but what 's this ? A trail of cheezos . Crunchy fun . My brain 's as big an A.B.B. So I 'll follow this trail . Maybe it will lead to a whole bag of cheezos . Another snack-related fatality . ( Noisy Slurping ) - What ? You skip lunch today . - Just hungry , I guess . I don 't want to complain , Lisa but these ribs are kind of well-done . I didn 't even cook this batch . Yet another one of Wyatt 's bizarro side-effects . Bizarro ? I haven 't noticed anything bizarro . Well , this is . And so is this . Gary 's got a point . Excuse me , but I just wanted more guts on the wrestling mat . Not more hair on my back . That cologne brought your bestial side to the surface . My bestial side ? The super hearing , the smelling , the hair . - ( Siren Wailing ) - ( Howling ) - That . - And the assertiveness you wanted- - the confidence- - it 's rooted in your pre-civilized self . It 's that way for everyone . Thanks for the lecture , Dr. Science but what 's next ? Wyatt marking his territory , or burying his caca ? I don 't understand . Wyatt shouldn 't have had any side-effects at all . - Not unless you over-spritzed today ? - Did you ? This is Wyatt Donnelly . The guy who saved every instruction manual since I was five . The guy who asked Mr Ortiz at school to translate the spanish part of my computer set-up instructions just in case they said something the english part didn 't . I spritzed once a day . Now , if you don 't mind , I 'm thirsty . But I 'm just ... I said I 'm thirsty . ( Growling ) ( Slurping ) ( Bell Ringing ) Another glorious day in P.E. , Wy . Though I gotta say it was classic when you gnawed a hole in wasserman 's headgear . ( Spritzing ) Well , well , if it isn 't Mr. " follow instructions " himself . It 's almost empty ! No wonder you 're turning into a walking toupee . I need that cologne . Ever since I started using it , I 've been feeling so great . Like I finally found that part of me that 's been missing . It 's awesome . The more I use , the better it gets . Wy , you 're addicted . Yogot a monkey on your back . Hell , you are a monkey ! I 'm pouring this out . You can 't do that ! It 's for your own good . You 're out of control . - ( Hissing ) - No biting . Nice going . You spilled it all . Oh , oh . Forget the cologne . Look in the mirror . I don 't feel so good . - It 's simple . - That skunk sauce made Wyatt a monkey . - How much simpler can it get ? - Not a monkey , a hominid . A proto-human . Wyatt 's slipped back down the evolutionary ladder . The condition he 's in now- - he 's right about here after the homo habilis but before the neanderthal give or take some shoe sizes . How long till he 's Wyatt Donnellytus again ? - Stop doing that . - Not until the spell wears off . That 's it . It 's ix-nay on the big duo date . - So close , yet so not close . - What ? You 're giving up ? Aw , man . Think about it . As Wyatt , the chimp-faced boy this could be yours and anybody else 's most embarrassing date . But Mindy and Deb most gorgeous girls in school . We can 't pass up change like that . I won 't let you do it . Nope , we 'll just sit here eating bananas watching echino man until you 're you again . ( Grunts ) Gary . I appreciate you looking out for me . I do , but date tonight . It once in a lifetime deal . Must do it . Not just for me , for both of us . Must go . Wyatt may have regressed a few hundred thousand years - but he 's more confident . - See ? - We pull off evening , no problem . - " We pull off evening " ? - No , Tarzan . - Look . If things get bad we call it sun go down , moon up . - Call it a night ? - Mmm . - Call it night . - Maybe she likes animals . Okay . Okay . But the second things go wacky we 're out of there . ( Wyatt Growling ) Oh , yeah . This is good idea . - Keep your hat down . - To order ? The barbecue chicken pizza but no-sun-dried tomatoes . I 'll have that too , with the tomatoes but no cheese . - Sure . - I want meat . - Meat , meat , meat ! - High-protein diet . - Cheeseburger fries . - Got it . I love the beard . It 's cooler than that scraggly one Ethan Hawke has . ( Sniffing ) Gary , are you wearing cologne ? No , Wyatt went overboard in the fragrance department . Really ? I like it . Don 't you ? - ( Sneezes ) - Do you have a cold ? No . Allergies . Is there a cat in here ? ( Sniffing ) No cat . And one good squeeze and the ketchup hit the ceiling . - Up there not far from the corner . - Dessert ? - Wyatt , you 've been kind of quiet tonight . - ( Mumbling ) Yeah , well , that 's ' cause Wyatt 's feeling depressed . His cousin , you see , who lives in ... Poland ... Well , he 's not doing so well . He give you that great hat ? - The hat ? - Yeah , right ? - From Poland . - Can I look ... Nope ! It doesn 't come off until his uncle ... cousin . Cousin feels much better and is on his feet . Dessert ? - ( Growling ) - He 's still nibbling . Excuse me . - What do you think ? - I like Wyatt . Me too . The other guy 's uptight . Mm-hmm . Wyatt 's sincere and kind of sexy and when he looks at you he 's got that hunger in his eyes . " How was the big date , Gary ? " " Fine . We talked . We laughed . Wyatt gutted the waitress . " - My food ! - You 're getting worse . - Let 's call it a sun go down . - No stop . Give me one good reason why we should continue . - Sweet food after meat ? - We are not staying for dessert . Come on . Sorry , girls . Wyatt 's got a curfew . - I got to take him home . - Come ? Sure . ( Twang ) Thought you were safe , my furry friends ? Even in the puny light of the toenail moon I can see you . - ( Bird Squawks ) - One loudmouth mockingbird , 11 : 00 . - ( Frog Croaks ) - One puke-green tree frog , 2 : 00 . Ohh ... yes . One cross-your-heart playtex just aching to be unsnapped . Ahh . - So , you girls comfortable ? - Yeah . - What happened to the music ? - Good question . - Wyatt , how 's that music coming ? - ( Sniffing ) - ( Growling ) - Huh ? I got it , Cheetah . - ( Loud Music Playing ) - Aaah ! - ( Music Lowered ) - ( Humming ) - ( Whistles ) - Hmm ? So ... here we are . ( Moaning ) Looks like the mood 's been set . What do you want to do ? Leave . I like that take-charge attitude ! ( TV Playing ) Can you watch talking box somewhere else ? No . Can you ... ? Ohh ! Wyatt ! Something 's happening . Your date 's going ape . Your cologne must have rubbed off on her . ( Growling ) All right , that 's it . I 'm getting Lisa . - ( Computer Beeps ) - That 's not the password ? But " password " has always been the password . - ( Beeps ) - Aah ! He must have changed it . Excuse me , Wyatt ? I need Lisa 's new password . ( Growling ) I need Lisa 's new password . - Hrungk . - Hrungk ? Got it . Hrungk . Here . Have a party . Hmm ? Hrungk ? What the heck is that supposed to mean ? This is never going to work . Son of a gun . Keep your hands and arms inside the tram at all times and don 't make eye contact . So they have fur on their faces . The spell will wear off soon enough . See ? They 're losing interest in each other . I don 't feel ... good . - Why didn 't you do something . - I was stunned . - What did you do ? - You have magic powers . Do something ! That wasn 't quite what I had in mind . ( Chattering ) Well , well . Looks like we 've got company . Come out , come out wherever you are ! ( Laughter ) Huh ? The old raptor strategy : create a diversion in front while you flank me from the side . Well , you 're going to have to be one crafty vermin to put one over on probationary buck private third class Chett Donnelly . Whoa ! Aah ! ( Groaning ) - I 'll be back ... - ( Laughter ) To blow you back to whatever planet you came from you mutant ... - There they are . - Look at that . - That 's disgusting . - Oh , I don 't know . - They make a cute couple . - Huh ? Um ... I just wanted to say I had a really wonderful time ... tonight , Wyatt . - Yeah , me too . - What are we doing up here ? Up where ? Wyatt turns Mindy into an ape shares head lice and she still goes out with him ? Never underestimate the power of animal instinct . ( Growling ) Ugh . Captioned by Grantman Brown

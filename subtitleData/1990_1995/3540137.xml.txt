 ( NEIGHING CONTINUES ) ( MAN COMMANDING HORSE ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( HORSES NEIGH ) Easy ! Morning . Morning . Y 'all mind sleeping aside ? You know what I think ? No , sir , I don 't . I think you got yourselves a shipment of gold in that wagon , that you 're bringing to General Lee . Just who might you be ? A friend of the Confederacy . Why don 't Y 'all just show us what a good friend you are by sleeping aside ? I 'd be most happy to , except first , I 'd be much obliged if you 'd give me that gold I don 't think I heard you correct . I think you did . I 'd Like that gold now . Listen , mister , it ain 't very nice out here as you can see . There are five of us . If you don 't step aside now , I 'd just as soon kill you as now . You wanna die out here in this miserable weather , that 's your choice . I 'm gonna ask you one more time . Would you please give me the gold ? Good afternoon , senators . The President is very grateful for your time here . Believe me , this is a matter of the utmost importance . I cannot stress too much the utmost secrecy . Why don 't you just cut out the shit , George ? You 're here to ask the committee for money , so come out and ask for it . Thanks for the advice . I am gonna ask you for money . Guess what else ? You 're gonna give it to me . You all remember Dr. Hans Kleindast , the Nobel Laureate , who helped us during the space program ? For 20 years , he 's been keeping his face off of Time magazine doing research . His field of research has been time travel . Time travel . Time travel . Well , beam me up , Scotty . That 's very funny , Senator . Wanna know what 's funnier than that ? He 's gonna tell us . The funny thing is , the good doctor actually did it . I thought that 'd get your attention . He did it . The technology is in the folders in front of you . You won 't understand it any better than I can . Now , you can 't go forward , because the future hasn 't happened yet . However , you can go back , and that 's where things get tricky . If you go back and change something , it 's serious . it could be catastrophic . It 's like throwing a stone in a Lake , only now they are ripples in time . So you can 't go back and kill Hitler , much as we 'd Like to , because it could cause a chain reaction of events that could alter or even destroy mankind . And that , my good senators , is where you come in . We have to form a new agency to police this technology and to actually protect time . it will be called the Time Enforcement Commission or the T.E.C. Eugene Matuzak of the Washington P.D. is our choice to run the commission . How much is this gonna cost ? A lot . How much is a lot ? More than a little and less than too much . This is now a good time to ask for money . The economy ... Suppose one of our competitors goes back in time and invents the computer ? Or the airplane or the automobile ? You wanna talk about the American economy , Senator ? How about this one ? Saddam Hussein finances a trip to 1944 ? He gets our technology , and Iraq becomes the first country to have the atomic bomb . Oh , you Like that one . Not bad . Try this one . We think there 's already been a ripple . Ten days ago , the CIA broke up an arms sale to terrorists in Hamburg , Germany . Ordinary , that sort of news doesn 't cross the President 's desk . what made this different was that the purchase was made with gold bullion , and the bullion was dated 1863 , and stamped " Confederate States of America . " We had it carbon-tested and authenticated . It 's real . Now , just think about what I 'm saying . Going back in time is a pretty easy way to make money . Our committee Would have exclusive jurisdiction over this program ? Yours and yours alone . No one can know about this . It 's too dangerous . That 's very good , George . Personally , I think this sounds Like that bullshit Star Wars program . You 'll get your money . Anyone here want to chair the oversight on this program ? Yeah , I 'll do it . Young Senator McComb . Why now ? Oh , you 'll Like him , George . Very much Like you , except his dorsal fin 's a bit bigger . ( CLOCKS CHIMING ) MAX : There 's never enough time . Never enough for what ? To satisfy a woman . Then you never want to miss an opportunity Are you busy ? I 'm meeting my husband . If I were him , I Would now keep you wailing .

( LAUGHING ) You didn 't answer my question Are you gonna lake this job ? I think so . Is this T.E.C. thing dangerous ? I don 't bake cookies for a Living Will you have to travel ? Not the way you think . Pictures bring back your memories . You 're gonna be very happy you have this . Why ? I can see into the future . You can see the future , huh ? Mmm-hmm ! what do you see ? I see it 's gonna rain . We both have the afternoon off . Why don 't we go and practice some of those words you seem to Like so much ? Max ? what ? I have something I want to tell you . ( PHONE RINGING ) shit . I 'm sorry . Don 't answer it . Just this once , don 't answer it . ( PHONE RINGING ) I have to . walker . Now ? Oh , Jesus Christ ! Can you find somebody else ? look , somebody called in sick and ... And there 's nobody but Max walker to keep the streets safe . I said I was sorry . It 's now Like I have a choice . Of course you have a choice . This is what I do . I know that 's what you do . It 's just that things are different now . what are you talking about ? This isn 't the way I wanted to do this . I have to go . There 's something you need to tell me ? Yes . Can you wail until I get back ? Sure . Surprise . ( MELISSA SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( MAX GROANING ) ( SCREAMS ) Max ! melissa ! Max !

Senator NeIson , this is T.E.C. Director Matuzak . Senator NeIson is the newest member of the oversight committee . Since he 's gonna be voting on your budget , he 'd Like to see how it 's spent . Senator McComb , our Long-standing committee chairman agreed to lake time out from his presidential campaign to accompany us . Senator . Well . Be a pleasure to show you around . NELSON : Are these all of your agents ? Most of them . Agent Monroe . Agent Anderson . Agents Burr , BartoIo and Shepherd . Agent walker . Agent walker . I 've heard a great deal about you . And I 've heard a lot about you . Not all of it bad , I hope . Agent walker just returned from a successful mission . Well , congratulations , Agent walker . Senator , now Director Matuzak will show you the Launch room . Follow me . I 'll show you where we kick off . You wouldn 't mind if Agent walker accompanied us ? I 'd Love to hear about his most recent mission . I have a report to file . Agent walker Would be delighted . MAN ON P.A .. : All units switch to T.E.C. channel three . All units switch to T.E.C. channel three . As you can see , we 've spared every expense . No comfort , no convenience , no necessities . Watch your head . So , Agent walker , who were you after ? A man named Alwood . Ring a bell ? Alwood . No . Should that name be familiar to me ? Unfortunately , Alwood was a T.E.C. agent . Really ? See , George , I don 't want to sound Like a broken record , but that 's one of the dangers of having an agency Like this . Imagine the dangers of now having it . Did you know this Alwood ? He was my partner . Oh , I 'm sorry . Nothing worse than a rogue cop . Except the guy who paid him . If there is such a guy . There always is . Do you know who the man is ? Oh , yeah . Why don 't you arrest him ? I lost my witness . Oh . Well , I trust you 'll keep working on it . You can bet on it . Hydrogen specialists , prepare for inspection . We 've updated our entire operation to Parker Datalink Systems , utilizing their superconducting chip . SPOTA : Senator McComb was Jack Parker 's partner and sold out before the company got the patent on that chip . Bel that cost you a few billion . Whoa , bad luck . My deal with Jack Parker is now important , Mr. spota . what is important is talking about the dangers of this program . You got my vole . Excuse me . what dangers ? Well , dishonest agents Like this Alwood . Every time an agent goes back , he risks making contact with the past version of himself . That 's could be a disaster . And why is that ? The same matter can 't occupy the same space at the same time . It 's never happened . Not yet , but what I propose is far less costly yet accomplishes the same thing . Why don 't we just prevent time travel rather than spend money trying to police it ? I have to get back to the hill . malcolm , this is a project that we could do without . I hope you vole against continued appropriations . I admire your dedication , Agent walker . I hope you keep trying to get your man . I never quit . LAWRENCE : We 've done a breakdown of the latest poll results . while the trends are now what we want , there are some good things we can utilize . The numbers in the suburbs are encouraging but they are killing you in the urban centers . But you 're gaining with the pro-life , pro-death-penalty coalition , and with the close-our-border , anti-immigration faction . The bad news is the campaign chairman put together a projected budget from now to Election Day , and it 's a big number . Even going back again , I don 't see how you could get it all in time . Lawrence , I love you . I really do . but don 't tell me what I can 't do . Elections are won with television . You don 't need the press , endorsements . You don 't even need the truth . You need money . So , tell me . How much is it gonna cost to buy the network time I need ? $ 50 million . $ 50 million . Agent walker has already cost me that much . We 're gonna chat with him , the kind of cat a man remembers for a lifetime . Sure is a handsome devil , isn 't he ? He 's now my type . what did you want to talk about ? what do you know about him ? Capable of eating his young . He sure seemed interested in you this afternoon . He interests me . Alwood named him . You 're shitting me . He 's the one who sent him back . Why didn 't he testify ? McComb Would go after his family . He also said McComb has half of the agency . I believe him . He doesn 't have me . I said he doesn 't have me . Well , fuck you , too . He 's gonna close the agency . Then no one can stop him from going back . This one is mine . Not unless I say it is . The son of a bitch is a presidential candidate .

How 's our leading presidential candidate making these expeditions into the past without our equipment , old pal ? The prototype was never dismantled . Kleindast 's . It 's in CaIverton , maryland . Short drive from Washington . We have no authority to get in there . what about Ricky ? If you were my best friend , you wouldn 't do this to me . McCOMB : I Would have had him killed right here , but if he 's back , he 's already told the story to Matuzak . God knows who else . They won 't get it , but they 'll sure give it thought if he comes up dead . Right . He 'll have to be erased . Erased . Have him killed before he joined T.E.C. That 's way nobody in the Agency ever talked to him or even knew him . Perfect . It 's now perfect . It 's all we 've got . Don 't expect to be my chief of staff if slamming you into the side of the car turns you into a sniveling worm . Well , what do you know ?

 Are you going to leave this up all year ? Yup . All year . Since you always made us take the Christmas tree down the day after Christmas , I 'm making up for lost time . If your idea of a good time is to pick up dried pine needles , treat yourself . As if he 's an authority on having a good time . That 's okay , Mom . I got that . Oh . Okay . Okay , Maggie , let 's shove off . Oh . Okay . Well , thank you for having us . Dinner was delicious , as usual . Thanks , Mom . Good sailing , Ahab . Good night , Starbuck . How is work ? Good ? Yup . It 's good . Well ... Well , drive carefully . Uh-huh . Good night , Daddy . Here on Incredible Inventions , though , you 're not going to spend $ 110.00 for it . You all know that . You 're not even going to spend $ 100.00 . There 's an approximate one-month supply here and all you 'll spend for this entire package is just $ 39.92 . I was kind of interested that Allen was a blond ... Dad ? I thought you guys left . Where 's Mom ? Hello . Hello ? Dana ... Mom ? What 's the matter ? We , um ... we lost your dad . He had a ... a massive coronary about an hour ago . He 's gone . I swear , Christmas Day ... my whole family 's opening presents and all and I 'm just sitting there in my own little world thinking " I just wish Jim were here . " I know . Oh , man ... busted . Yes , sir ? Out of the vehicle , please . Sir , I 'm sorry . We 'll be on our way . I said , out of the vehicle . Keep your hands down . Let 's see some I.D. No . Not till I see yours . Last time you were that engrossed , it turned out you were reading the adult video news . I didn 't think you 'd be in today . How are you , Dana ? " Dana . " I 'm fine . Thank you . What are you working on ? Two days ago , a couple was kidnapped at Jackson University . Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers ... both 19 . Last year , another couple was kidnapped to the day . Except that abduction occurred at Duke University . One week later , they found both students ' bodies dead . They were kept alive , tortured during that period . No arrests were ever made . Police believed it to be a one-time offender . But now it appears to be a serial incident . Anyway ... if he holds true to form , we have five days to find those kids . That 's a grim deadline . Here 's another grim deadline . In one week , Luther Lee Boggs will take a seat in the North Carolina gas chamber . How is he related ? He claims to have information relating to the kidnapping . He described Hawley 's bracelet down to the last detail . This is information that only family members could have known . Or the kidnapper . Boggs feels that if his talents help save these kids , then his sentence should be reduced to life in prison . His " talents " ? He claims to have obtained this information through psychic transmissions . Mulder , do I detect a hint of skepticism ? Perhaps . Boggs has been there before ... in the chamber . My profile helped send him there . He was actually strapped to the chair before receiving an executive stay . He claims that this experience activated in him the ability to channel spirits and demons . I believe in psychic ability without a doubt , but not in this case . Not Boggs . So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from the inside . A scam to save his life ? At the age of six , Luther Boggs slaughtered every pet animal in his housing project . When he was 30 , he strangled five family members over Thanksgiving dinner and then sat down to watch the fourth quarter of the Detroit-Green Bay game . Some killers are products of society . Some act out past abuses . Boggs kills because he likes it . And they 've requested you speak with him ? Actually , he 's requested to speak to me . Why you ? He read my profile on him and he feels like I 'm the only one who truly understands what he is . Anyway , I leave for Raleigh this afternoon . I 'll go with you . The funeral is at noon . I think you should take some time . I need to work . I 'm sorry about your father . I 'll see you later . Okay . As a captain , he was entitled to burial in Arlington with full ceremony . This is exactly the way he wanted it . Just the family . This song was playing when his ship returned from the Cuban Blockade . He marched right off , up to me ... and he proposed . I know that you and Dad were ... disappointed that I chose the path I 'm on , instead of medicine but I need to know ... Was he at all proud of me ? He was your father . The soul of Luther Boggs drowns in Hell 's sea of fire . We have him now . We ? You mean the souls of your victims ? The dead . The living . All souls are connected . And you 're the conduit ? Uh , Dana ... Fox ... please understand that from here we can return to the past . We can see the present . We can know the future . From here ? Where exactly are you ? Mr. Boggs must be made redemptive for his transgressions . That 's exactly what the state of North Carolina intends to do next week . Uh-uh . Let 's deal . Boggs ' life for the kids . You know what I 'm saying ? First you 've got to prove you 're telling the truth . Don 't get me wrong , Luther . I want to believe . Oh ! Oh ! God ! No . Must stop . Stop . Stop . Stop . Stop ! Pain ! Pain . Terrible pain . Um , the boy . Uh , Jim . Uh , he 's tied with twine . Uh , packing twine . He whips them with a coat hanger , a wire coat hanger . Oh . Dark place . Cold . A cellar . Warehouse , condemned . An angel of stone . Waterfall . Water falling . That 's not a waterfall . Not water . They 're there . Oh , God . I got to go . I got to go . I ... got to go . I tore this off my New York Knicks t-shirt . It has nothing to do with the crime . Did you get my message , Starbuck ? Thanks a lot . Scully , what 's wrong ? Did Boggs say something to you ? No . It 's my father . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . That 's all right . Why don 't you go back to the motel . We 've exposed Boggs as a fraud . Boggs is not what he claims to be . He may be orchestrating the kidnapping . Now he knows we 're on to him , he doesn 't have a chance with this charade . I 'm going to wait around here for a couple hours and try to interrogate him . Hopefully , he 'll tell me where the kids are . Water falling . It 's not a waterfall . An angel of stone . It 's Mulder . I just heard that Liz Hawley 's family made a positive I.D. on the charm you found at the warehouse . The police are searching that place inch by inch but they haven 't been able to find anything yet . I expected to find you at the crime scene . Did Boggs confess ? No . No . It was five hours of Boggs 's channeling . After three hours , I asked him to summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix and requested " All Along the Watchtower . " You know , the guy 's been dead 20 years but he still hasn 't lost his edge . I lied to the police about how I found the warehouse . I didn 't notice any suspicious activity . Then how did you find it ? It was where Boggs said it would be . Scully , I told you about Boggs . I didn 't go looking for it ! I came across an area that had landmarks he spoke of . That doesn 't matter ! That 's exactly what Boggs wanted . He could have been setting you up . You could be dead right now . Why did you feel you had to lie on your police report ? I thought it would be a better explanation under the circumstances . What you 're really saying is that you didn 't want to go on record admitting that you believed in Boggs . The Bureau would expect something like that from Spooky Mulder , but not Dana Scully . I thought that you would be pleased that I 'd opened myself to extreme possibilities . Why now ? After all we 've seen , why Boggs ? Does this have to do with your father ? He said that he didn 't approve of you becoming an FBI agent . If being on the job now makes you feel guilty or uncomfortable or uneasy , I think you should back away . Because if it 's clouding your judgment , you 're putting yourself in danger . I love this job . You love your father . Dana ... open yourself up to extreme possibilities only when they 're the truth . That goes for Luther Boggs ... and your father . As for Luther Boggs , he 's the greatest of lies . I know he 's working with someone on the outside and they planted that evidence , and we have to be very careful about plotting our next move because he 's planned five steps ahead . The only advantage we have is time . Scully , take a look at this . That 's incredible . They found them ? That 's exactly what I want Boggs to think . I don 't understand . Why didn 't the police notify us ? They haven 't been found . The article is bogus . The Carolinian made this one up just for us . Only six people know about it . Later on today , Boggs gets his weekly phone privileges . Hopefully , he 'll call his accomplice to find out what happened . Phone privilege is in two hours . Go . Turn off that phone . Turn it off . Mulder , it 's you . Mulder . How come you don 't believe me ? Agent Scully does . She believes me . Agent Scully believes what we all believe ... that you have the kids . Now , where are they ? Mulder , even if he is setting us up we have to follow , because in three days ... Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead . And then , a day later , our only connection to the case will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber . We have to deal . The kidnapper is aroused by the prospect of becoming a killer . What 's the name ? Can 't see ... male ... Describe him . Small ... thin ... late 20s ... skull ... human skull ... silver gray ... his eyes ... cold ... very cold ... staring at Elizabeth ... God , he 's got the wire ... No ... please ... no . Where is he ? He 's over ... over ... by the window ... holding back his ... holding back his thoughts of killing us ... waiting ... there 's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan . You got that ? Mulder ... don 't go near the white cross . We see you down ... and your blood spills on the white cross . No , no , no ... ! Anything ? Sweep the docks ! Got it ! Federal agent ! Aah ! Mulder ! We need an ambulance ! Officer down ! - Coming through ! - What do we got ? It 's a through-and-through , upper femur . Can 't palpate a radial pulse . Okay , I want a BP on him , stat . Let 's get him on the gurney . Blood pressure is 67 on palpation . Okay , tighten and screen him for six . I want two liters of normal saline in now and give him two units of O-neg after the typing . Let 's transfer now . No . No . No . Lucas Jackson Henry , 28 . Did some time at Angola in Louisiana for sexual assault , narcotics ... nothing big , really . His personal history includes being witness to an auto accident in which his high school sweetheart was killed and his mother decapitated . The seven-year anniversary of that accident is in three days . He 's reliving it . That would explain the deadline . The most important element we found is there 's substantial suspicion that Luther Lee Boggs' last five murders were committed with a partner . Now , the police up in Durham say they could never prove it in court but they know that partner was Lucas Henry . You set us up . You 're in on this with Lucas Henry . This was a trap for Mulder because he helped put you away . Well , I came here to tell you that if he dies because of what you 've done , four days from now , nobody will stop me from being the one that will throw the switch and gas you out of this life for good , you son of a bitch ! Dana ... you 're the one that believed me . No ... no , I do not believe you ! If you don 't believe me , maybe you 'll believe yourself . There was that one time , when I was 14 , and my parents had gone to bed and I snuck downstairs all alone . Got one of my mom 's cigarettes and went out onto the porch in the dark . I was so scared . My heart was beating . I mean , they would 've killed me if they knew . But I was so excited . Not ' cause of the cigarette ... I mean , it was gross , but ... because I wasn 't supposed to . That could be a moment from any kid 's life . I know what you want and I know who you want to talk to . Why don 't you just go ahead and ask me . I 'll believe you ... if you let m ... me talk to him . Starbuck ... No , no , no ! Nobody talks to anybody until I get a deal . Don 't underestimate my fear of dying and don 't downplay my terror of going back to that chair . I know my hell 's going to be to go on back to that chair over and over again for all of time , but in this life ... my one and only life ... I don 't ever want to go back again . Ever ! The last time I went to death 's door and looked inside I had never talked to a minister before in my life , ever , until that day and he said , " He who doth not love " remains in death . " And he who hates his brother is a murderer " and no murderer has eternal life abiding in him . " My family , who I killed after their last meal was right there to watch me over mine and their fear and their horror that I made them feel when I killed them was injected into me and their collective fear alone was just one taste of Hell . And then I felt myself leave my body . I thought they had already killed me and I saw thousands of souls rushing into my body . It is a cold , dark place , Scully . Mulder 's looking in on it right now . It may be a cold , dark place for you but it 's not for Mulder and it 's not for my father . I 'm sure he 'd like to tell you hisself but I 'm not going to let him . Nobody speaks until you get me a deal . I don 't believe you . Oh , well , there 's plenty of room in that cold , dark place for liars , Scully . You go ahead and play it like you need to but I know you believe me . But if you need to convince a judge I 'm in on it with Lucas , go ahead , ' cause either way ... whether I 'm running the show with Lucas or I 'm channeling ... no information 's coming till I get a deal . I got nothing to lose . Guard ! If I die ... that boy goes to that cold , dark place . The governor and the supreme court of North Carolina do not intend to make a deal with a mass murderer . Especially one who I know is orchestrating a capital offense two days before his capital punishment . Yes , sir . The only thing Boggs will get from me is a timely death . It 's an overdue one at that . We 're running out of time . There 's still no sign of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers . The Raleigh police said ... No matter what , don 't believe him . Boggs created this whole charade to get back at me for putting him on Death Row . You 'd be the next best thing . Mulder , I never thought I 'd say this but what if there 's another explanation ? Don 't ... deal with him . He could be trying to claim you as his last victim . All right , Mr. Boggs ... you got your deal . Thank you , ma 'am . Thank you . All right , where are they ? Uh ... I ... uh ... I see , like , uh ... uh , circles . Uh ... I don 't know , like ... barrels . No . No , bigger . Like , uh ... huge , uh ... vats , uh ... factory . Uh , condemned . The old , uh , Blue Devil Brewery up by Morrisville . Oh , God , he 's getting , uh ... he 's getting ready . He ... he ... he 's getting ready to , um ... um ... he 's getting ready to kill the d ... Whew ... Luther , if you really were psychic ... I would 've known you lied . That there never was a deal . I know you tried . Scully ... Avoid the Devil . Don 't follow Henry to the Devil . Leave that to me . Freeze ! Federal agents ! We 're armed ! Drop your weapon . There he is . - Hold on ... - All right . ... get over here ! Go ! Oh , my God ... Easy , easy ... Over here ! He fell down . You come to say good-bye ? I believe that if you had orchestrated this kidnapping , Lucas Henry would have been aware of the danger you warned me about . He never would have crossed that bridge . So you saved ... Jim Summers ' life . But you saved mine as well . You come for some unfinished business . You want your father 's message . Not now . Be there tonight . My witness . And when they got me in that chair and they ... open up that shield you get your message . Our Father Who art in Heaven , hallowed be Thy name . Thy kingdom come , Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven ... Would you like to make a statement ? ... our daily bread , and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us . And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil , for Thine is the kingdom , and the power and the glory forever and ever , Amen . I was considering Boggs . If he knew that I was your partner , he could have found out everything he knew about me . About my father . Scully ... " Beyond the Sea " was playing at my parents ' wedding . Visions of deceased loved ones are a common psychological phenomena . If he knew that my father had ... Dana ... after all you 've seen , after all the evidence , why can 't you believe ? I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid to believe . You couldn 't face that fear ? Even if it meant never knowing what your father wanted to tell you ? But I do know . How ? He was my father .

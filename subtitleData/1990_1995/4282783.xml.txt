 Scramble ! Scramble ! All hands on deck ! Emergency drill ! Scramble ! Er , perhaps you didn 't catch that - SCRAMBLE ! Yeah , great . With bacon and beans , man . Look , Starbug 's an inferno , the engine room 's waist deep in fuel , and we 're being attacked off the starboard bow . - Really ? - Of course not really . It 's a drill . We 're pretending Starbug 's under attack . And I 'm pretending to scramble , man . Goodnight . You 've got 30 seconds or I declare you officially dead . Good , then we can rest in peace . Well , congratulations . Scrambling in a Red Alert situation , a new record time - 1 hour , 17 minutes , 39 seconds . Not bad . We could get one sixteen without the fourth round of toast . You think I 'm a petty-minded bureaucratic nincompoop , who delights in enforcing regulations because he gets a perverse pleasure from it , and in many ways you 're absolutely damn right , but , nevertheless , the only way we 'll track down Red Dwarf is with a sense of discipline and purpose and , wherever possible , a sensible haircut . - I 'm going back to bed . - Would it hurt to have hair like mine ? I have got hair like yours ... just not on my head . Well , I 'm no stranger to the land of scoff . Every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts . - Oh , surely not , sir . - Why did the US Cavalry beat the Indians ? Short back and sides versus girly hippy locks . The Cavaliers and the Roundheads - one-nil to the pudding basins . Vietnam , crew-cuts both sides - no-score draw . Oh , for a really worid-class psychiatrist . Check your screens . I 'm getting something up my left nostril . Scans are all negative . At the risk of challenging your olfactory excellence , perhaps a re-smelling is in order . I 'm telling you , my nostril hair 's shimmying like a grass skirt on a fat Hawaiian hula-hoop champion . - There 's something out there . - Scan 's still dry . That 's it . I 'm invoking Space Corp Directive 68250 . 68250 ? But , sir , surely that 's impossible without at least one live chicken and a rabbi . - Forget it . Forget I was ever born . - Sir , I 'll perform the ceremony , but I 'm bewildered as to how sacrificing poultry will help the problem . Wait a minute . Major power surge off the port bow . He 's right . Some kind of vessel . It 's uncloaking . He 's too close ! That power surge 'll toss us around like sweat in an aerobics teacher 's buttock cleavage . Hang on . Here it comes . - Damage report ? - Superficial . Navicomp 's down , slight rupture in fuel pipe 9 and the headset 's got jammed on the Country and Western Channel . Second wave coming ! What 's he thinking of , warping that close ? Damn space hog ! That 's a Space Corp external enforcement vehicle . - What ? - The space filth . A computer-controlled enforcement probe . It 's scanning us now . - Incoming . - Property Corp Space removing and equipment Corp Space damaging , ships Corp Space of series a looting with charged formerly are you . The materialization has scrambled its voice unit . It 's making as much sense as a Japanese VCR instruction manual . - Plead you do how ? - It 's in reverse . " How do you plead ? " - How do we plead to what ? - It 's charging us with looting derelicts . We don 't loot derelicts . We just hack in and swipe what we need . If this goes to trial , I demand separate lawyers . What 's the penalty ? If it means outfits with arrows on , I 'm committing suicide . Er , no , sir . It means outfits with wings and halos on . The penalty is execution . - Why so harsh ? - It 's frontier law , sir . We 're the equivalent of horse rustlers . Severe sentencing is the only way to maintain order . Don 't expect mercy . - What do we do ? - We 're as guilty as the man behind the grassy knoll . - Admit it , and it 'll blow us out of space . - Recommendations ? Suggest I take the rap and say I forced you at gunpoint to do my bidding . - Kryten , we can 't let you do that ! - Really ? Dream on , metal trash . Get your hands in the air and step into that searchlight . - Minute one have you . - No choice . Plot a course for scarper city . Sir , it can easily outrun us . Kryten , the Eastbourne Zimmer frame relay team can easily outrun us . It 's not about speed . It 's about wit and cunning . - I hoped it wouldn 't come to that . - Look at your screens . We 're near the Gelf Zone . It wouldn 't follow us in there . No , because Gelfs are scavengers with no regard for life , law or property . - So we 'll be safe . - You 've heard the stories . They skin humans alive and turn them into beanbags . Unless you want a triple-buttocked Gelf sitting on your face , probing your crevices for lost biros , I suggest you rethink . In the absence of a sane plan , I suggest we go with Mr Lister 's . Seconds 20 in firing commence will I , reply a of absence in . - Roughly translated , hit the reheat . - You don 't have to tell me twice . Cat , hit the reheat ! Sorry . Guess you DO have to tell me twice . Firing commence will I or halt ! - Bony butts our move let 's ! - Close comms . - Comms closed . - Gelf zone six clicks . - Weapon lock . Pulse missile launched . - Impact in ten seconds . - That 's it . We 're platform shoes , man . - Firing chaff . Firing flares . - Brace for impact . - Missed us ! - Warning shot . - Won 't be next time . - Four clicks to Gelf Zone . - Another lock . - Incoming pulse fire . - Decoys launched . - Six seconds to impact ! - We 've gotta shake ' em off ! We 've lost it . Sorry , I was looking at the wrong panel . Damage report ? It 's bad , bud . Looks like Starbug 's been hit . - Details , halibut breath ! - According to the damage report machine , there are several small fires , lots of smoke and the navicomp 's fizzing . Oh , damn ! Now the damage report machine 's exploded . - Another lock ! - This 'll finish us off . - How far to the Gelf Zone ? - Click and a half . - We 've lost three fuel tanks ! - Wait ! I 'm picking something up . Got it . Putting it on visual . Look at that thing . It must be a mile across . A Gelf icon . It 's some kind of warning beacon . - Incoming message . - Kar nasa pinit . - Wah twah morah ! - Running it through the translator . This is Gelf space . Death to the strangers . - Pulse missile launch . Impact in 12 seconds . - Head for the eye socket . - The eye socket ? - It 's a dead end ! - Just do it ! - Eight seconds . - We 're heading for solid rock . - Three seconds ... two ... one . - Manoeuvring thrusters are out . - Infra-red reports 53 separate fires . - Sprinkler systems are down . - There 's no way to put it out . We 'll blow . Wait ! Gelf moon bearing 356 by 121 . It 's got an ocean . Can you get there ? Does mouse shit roll ? I 'll get you there , bud . Look at it . All our possessions , all our valuables . Between fire , flood and impact damage , we 've lost damn near everything . Well , at least Mr Lister 's guitar survived intact . Not even Mr Lister 's guitar survived intact . It 's waist-high down there , but I got the pumps working . - Three hours and we 'll be dry . - Thrusters , boosters , reheat - auto-repair can fix everything , apart from the oxy-generation unit which is kaputzki . So we can take off but not breathe ? - We can 't repair it ? - It 's more charred than Lister 's fry-ups . Well , we 're snookered ... unless we trade with the Gelfs . - Trade ? You can 't be serious . - It 's our only option . Give me the arrow . It could tell us a whole lot about what we 're dealing with here . - Anything ? - Yep . This came from a bow , all right . Sorry . I was expecting more than that . As we anticipated , they are the Kinitawowi . Good . I have studied the dialect . They are one of the friendlier " kinteteach " or tribes . - Nice welcome ! - It 's a great honour to be greeted this way . They would kill us if they took exception to us . - That 's a very good sign . - It 's a good sign they haven 't killed us ? Absolutely . With the Kinitawowi , not skinning you alive is one of their warmest greetings . We are indeed " han hasset " or blessed . And , Kryten , you are indeed a " hachum babow " , or smart alec metal git . I 'll say we are in search of an engine part and that we have rare treasures to trade . Kinitawowi , nich niche histan kanoa nakoo bacoo . Nuyer neeal dol dager . Look . Look what we got . We got Swiss watches . Nice watch . Levi jeans ! Hey ! A hat . Look at this . Hey-hey-hey ! Nice hat ! Cigar ? Hey ! Cool dude ! I suggest caution , sir . Some Gelfs have their sphincteral orifices in their faces . Let 's hope you haven 't offended him . No , he seems quite pleased . We need an oxy-generation unit , savvy ? Ogigon bachoo machwahah . Ah . Aleesa . Alees tada . Cat , get the case , man . Machu , aloo atu ba ba . - It seems to be going well . - What is that thing ? It 's an emohawk . A polymorph that 's spayed at birth and half domesticated . It 's trained to change shape at its owner 's behest . Like all polymorphs it 's an emotional leech . It steals emotions from living creatures . Emotions are a highly valued trading commodity . - The oxy-generation unit . - They 're ready to fix a price . We 'd fixed a price with all the baubles . That was just for the honour of entering their " watunga " or hut . - The bartering proper begins now . - Rah ! Rec raht wig dic anatu pata . Oh , dear . - What ? What , you want my hat ? - Ah nu dewka ana weg bah . - You want my jacket ? - No , sir . He doesn 't want your jacket . - Not my longjohns ? - Not those either , sir . - Well , what then ? - Ahg nu dewka ana weg bah . Me ? He wants me ? Yes , sir . In exchange for the oxy-generation unit , he wants you to be his daughter 's mate . That 's his daughter ? ! One of three . Apparently , sir , she 's the looker . Tell him not if she was the last yeti lookalike in the world . Come on , Lister . You 've dated worse . Only due to very poor disco lighting . Ana beg ewitah ogigon nich kawal bah . He says no wedding , no OG unit . Panta anag ew . Panta wa ah . He 's giving us five hanaka to decide . - How long 's a hanaka ? - Curiously enough , one Earth minute . Five hanaka . That only gives us 28 hours ! OK , let 's get out our sheet music and play the Real Waltz . I 'm not visiting to Moss Bros for anyone who is less attractive than my own armpit after 20 games of table tennis . What about us ? You can 't hang us out to dry just because she doesn 't hit your G-spot . What about sacrifice ? Putting your friends interests before your own ? Rimmer , it would never work out . She 's obviously an Aries . Me and Aries ? Forget it . Sir , they are proud people and won 't change their minds unless you are prepared to stay here and marry Hackhackhackachhachhachach . That 's her name ? ! I could never marry anyone whose name sounds like a footballer clearing his nose . The plan is we do the trade , you do the wedding , when everybody 's asleep , we rescue you . - What do you say ? - Not a chance in hell ! Ana dok kaz , ana dok wah , hah . I do . Ana zun keh , zun keh atta . - What 's he saying ? - You may kiss the bride , sir . What , without a bag ? Don 't be strangers , guys . See you soon . Drop in any time ... ANY TIME ! Hanibech yech , ogigon yech . Well , darling ... What a day . I 'm pooped . Straight to sleep for me . Nee bonnen nic parting . Maybe in the morning . Goodnight . You 've been looking forward to this . You won 't take no for an answer , will you ? Nack hey . OK , just give me a minute . I want to slip into something more comfortable - Starbug . Change of plan ! Leg it ! - Wait ! Something 's coming . - It 's the emohawk ! - What happened ? Where 'd it go ? - It transmuted into something else . Suggest we proceed with extreme caution . It 's somewhere close . I can smell it . It 's the stick ! No , it 's not . Oh , God , I 'm so jumpy . I thought it was the stick . It is the stick ! - Where is it ? - In the undergrowth . Cat , you know what they 're like . Stay on the case . Unbelievable , getting suckered like that . - 100 per cent concentration at all times . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . We 're airtight . Damn thing can 't get in now . Just took a little bit of concentration . How long before we can go ? We don 't really want a visit from Listy 's in-laws . It 'll take an hour to set the oxy-generation unit up . I suggest we take off and use emergency supplies until it 's on-line . - What if it doesn 't work ? - The Cat and Mr Lister choke to death . A plan with no drawbacks . Time we fitted that OG unit . - Kryters . - I 'm on my way , sir . That smell is still driving me crazy . I gotta wash my hands . Transferring to auto . It 's stolen my cool ! It 's taken all my style ! I need a mirror . I got no grace , no élan , no poise ! What 's it turned me into ? ! Duane Dibbley ? What is it ? I heard noises . Look what it 's done ! It 's turned me into the Duke of Dork . Oh , my God . Where is it ? I lost it . It came in here somewhere . - Can you smell it ? - The only scent I 'm getting is spot cream and dandruff shampoo that doesn 't work . It could be anywhere . It could be anything . Trust nothing . It may have outsmarted you , but it 'll have to get up pretty darn early in the AM to outsmart Arnie J. Is that a new gun ? I 've never seen it before . The gun ! The emohawk 's the gun ! Phew ! God , that was close . I hope you 're right , otherwise we just flushed away our only gun . Just leave the thinking to me , keyboard teeth . Lister , Kryten , Cat was right . We had the emohawk on board . Lucky for you guys , old iron-butt was around to sort it out . That 's weird . There 's something wrong with this microphone . It 's not transmitting . Are you OK , sir ? It 's removing my bitterness , taking my negativity , slurping out all my snidiness ! It 's gone now , sir . It 's OK to come out . Well , looks like we both bought a bite from the little blighter . Let 's track it down before it harms Kryters and Dave . I 'm afraid this means death for us , but it 's a small price to pay to save our chums . What a guy ! Listen ... Before we leave , I gotta change these clothes . If I don 't get into some sideways-ironed flares and plastic sandals , I 'll go crazy . Do what you have to , old chum . I 'll tell them we 're having a party . What was that ? The hydraulic lock , sir . We 're sealed in ! It won 't override ! I 've sealed you in , Dave . Me and the Cat took a nip from the emohawk . - It 's on board ? ! - It 's taken my bitterness and Cat 's cool . He 's looking so geeky he probably couldn 't even get into a science fiction convention . - It 's still on the loose ? - It 's in the obs room . - Well , let us help . - No one I 'd rather have with me in a fracas , but you 're the last human being alive , old love , and too damn valuable to risk . Only one way to guarantee victory - open the airlock , suck the perisher out into space . - That would also kill you and the Cat ! - He won 't suffer , Kryters . I 'll snap his neck when he 's not looking . He 'd want it this way . But if we capture the creature , we could extract the DNA and re-inject you both , restore your personalities . Too risky , Krytey . Anyway , I don 't think I could face becoming ... him again . Everyone has his limits . Smoke me a kipper , I 'll be back for breakfast . - What a guy ! - We 've got to save them from themselves . Their minds are totally distorted . The Cat 's a complete yutz , and Mr Rimmer 's , well ... nice . Charge up the bazookoids . We 'll blast our way in . Ready , old chum ? Just let me check . Thermos , sandwiches , corn plasters , telephone money , dandruff brush , animal footprint chart and one triple-thick condom . You never know ! OK , Duane , let 's step into the airlock and get the plan underway . - Oh , what plan is this ? - Just step in there , Duane . So , what precisely is the plan ? You 'll find it more comfortable if you stand in front of me . - Why are we in this airlock ? - Just relax , old chum . I 'm sending you ahead . I 'm the scout party ? Dave , you crazy fool . We 're saving your bacon . Don 't sling your love spuds on the barbecue . Sir , we can tackle the emohawk together . Yeah , one squirt of liquid dilinium will freeze it exactly where it stands . OK , fellas ... let 's go . It 's lasered its way back to the engine rooms . Probably looking for you two . Let 's go . According to the psi-scan , it 's somewhere in this location . It 's the barrel ! Sorry . False alarm . That chain . It 's moving ! Sorry ! Sorry ! Sir , stay calm . You 're experiencing a classic paranoid reaction to a terror situation . It 's essential at this time that we ... IT 'S THE WALL ! Shame overload . I ... I ... I ... Sorry . This is impossible . How can we find something that can disguise itself as anything ? - How can we lure it out ? - Worry not , Davey . It 'll strike soon enough . Oh . I dropped my thermos . Er , excuse me ? Sirs ? Gentlemen ? I think we have a suspect . I got it ! I got it ! Oh , it turned into a grenade , but I got it ! - Toss it away , old chum . - I throw like a geek ! Just chuck it . - It 's gonna blow ! - Leave this to me , Davey boy ! - Smoke me a kipper , I 'll be ... - Freeze it , Davey boy ! Sir , how did you know about your hard light drive ? Didn 't , Kryters . Just trying to protect you chaps . Well , sir , better get you back to normal . Can I stay like this for another 24 hours before I become that ghastly maggot ? It 's the least we can do . Would you like to stay as Duane ? Suck my thermos ! I hate being the prince of dorkness . You never know the next clutzy thing ... What a Dibbley ! # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

 Careful . My husband hasn 't left yet . I 'm not gonna fall for that . I happen to know you 're crazy about me . - It shows , huh ? - The feeling 's mutual . And that is one reason why we 're going to celebrate tomorrow night . What 's the other reason ? I was going to save this as a surprise for you tomorrow night but I may as well show it to you now . A calendar . Just what I 've always wanted . You haven 't seen the best part yet . A calendar with the days crossed off . That 's even better . Honey , it 's what those crosses represent that counts . Sam , you haven 't done any witchcraft for 29 days . - You finally noticed . - Yeah . I 'm very proud of you . We have another reason for a celebration . Not only have you not twitched for 29 days but we haven 't seen any of your witchy friends in that time either . - No offence . - None taken . I got a little head start on that when Mother said she was gonna go skin diving for a month . Good . Now , all you have to do is protect your record for good behaviour for two more days . I 'll try and keep my nose clean . I 'll see you tonight . Samantha , you 're still a vision of loveliness . I don 't know you . What are you doing in my kitchen ? Don 't fret , my dear . I have a feeling we 're gonna make a lovely couple . I have a feeling I 'm gonna blow my record . Just who are you ? My favourite food . Chocolate cake . You haven 't answered my question . Well , actually , there 's no reason why you should recognize me . When you used to sit with me , I was a callow youth . Brilliant , but callow . Babysit with you . Wait a minute . You 're not Rodney ? The same . I lost my callow . You mean you 're that pushy , spoiled , neurotic brat my mother used to force me to look after ? Knew you hadn 't forgotten . Fortunately , I matured with my neuroses intact . That 's what makes me so fascinating . Now , look , Rodney I happen to be very busy . So would you mind telling me why you 're here ? Well , even as an adolescent , I loved you , Samantha . - Oh , really ... - In a repressed way , of course . Could I have a little more chocolate cake ? Make it yourself . That 's mean and cruel of you , Samantha . You 're trying to hurt me . Take your chocolate cake and get out . Good . Why won 't you come away with me ? If I tell you , will you leave ? - Perhaps . - I think you 're obnoxious . Oh , one of those love-hate things , huh ? That 's okay . I 'm crazy about complex relationships . Rodney , don 't you understand ? I 'm married . I 'm above convention . And I have a baby . No . That 's out of the question . We 'll put her up for adoption . Rodney , if you don 't go away I 'll tell your mother on you . You don 't know where she is . - Do you ? - I 'll tell her you 've been misbehaving , Rodney . Okay , have it your way . We 'll take the kid with us . Rodney , I 've had just about all I can take . Samantha , I love you . I worship the air you fly in . - I 'll do anything for you . - Anything ? Then leave . Good . Honey , we have a visitor . - Who ? - Come and see . I found him outside . He just wouldn 't leave . Oh , Darrin , he 's marvellous . Oh , he 's so cute . I wonder who he belongs to ? Well , I don 't know . He doesn 't have any tag or ... Look at that . Looks like a case of love at first sight between you two . I guess we 'll have to take out an ad in the lost-and-found column . - I guess so . - You sound reluctant . Honey , if nobody claims him , would you mind if we kept him ? I thought you wanted to wait till we got a bigger place before we got a dog . - Well , I did . But I 'm crazy about his personality . Aren 't you ? Well , he does have a great face . And who could resist those big , brown eyes ? Let 's keep our fingers crossed that nobody claims him . How would you like to fix me a drink while I go upstairs and fiddle with my papers ? - What are wives for ? Thank you . Now , you stay right here and get to know my wife . You 'll be crazy about her . I just fixed that cake for tomorrow night . Rodney ? That 's you , isn 't it ? You get out of that fur coat right this minute . Now , just what are you doing here ? Oh , Samantha . My love for you is not warped and selfish . I wanted to get to know your husband . If I think he 's worthy of you I 'll leave by tomorrow morning . Believe me . If you don 't leave right now I 'm going to tell Darrin who you are . - No , you won 't . You don 't want him to know there were any non-mortals in the house . That would spoil your record and his celebration . Hey , he 's really crazy about me , isn 't he ? - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna hit you with this saucepan . You come a step further , I 'll turn into a dog . You wouldn 't hit a dumb animal , would you ? Oh , Rodney ... Sam , what are you doing ? You weren 't gonna hit him , were you ? He ate my chocolate cake . Well , honey , don 't be too hard on him . He 's probably hungry . Look , I 'll pick you up another cake tomorrow at Perkin 's Pastry Shop . I 'll bring it home from work . I better clean this up . Hi . Hey , he sure is affectionate , isn 't he ? He fawns a little too much . - Fawns ? - Yes . You know , all that licking and grovelling . - Well , honey , he 's very friendly but I wouldn 't call that grovelling , would you ? He tries a little bit too hard to please , that 's all . I brought your drink in , sweetheart . - Thanks . I 'll have it later . - You don 't like him . Darrin , I hardly know him . I just don 't want you to get too fond of him , that 's all . - Why not ? - Well I just don 't want you to get too attached to him . I wouldn 't want you to be disappointed . - Disappointed ? - In case his owner claims him , I mean . Oh , honey , you 're the greatest . What is the matter with you ? Darrin , I don 't think we should be doing this in front of him . The dog ? Well , he 's looking at us kind of funny . What shall we drink to ? Well , that 's easy . To one month of normalcy . - Sure means a lot to you , doesn 't it ? - Yes , it does . - And the first month is the hardest . - Oh , boy . Just remember , it 's all kind of psychological . If you get past this one day , it 'll be a breeze . Well , I 'll try not to disappoint you . - You take good care of him , honey . - You can rely on it . I phoned the ad in last night and left my office number . I hope nobody calls to claim him . Well , thank you . What did I do to deserve such a big kiss ? Nothing . Harriet Kravitz is spying on us from across the street . I thought we might as well give her her money 's worth . I 'll see you tonight , sweetheart . Goodbye , dog . Rodney . Rodney ! Rodney . I 'm not leaving . I 've decided he 's not worthy of you . Rodney , when are you going to get it through that pointed little head that we love each other ? Is that the only reason you have for not leaving him for me ? Isn 't that enough ? Coming , Tabatha . But if you had a fight and you split up , then you 'd come with me . For the last time , we are not going to split up . What makes you so sure ? I 'm interested . We have a marriage that 's based on mutual trust and respect . If I proved that wasn 't true , then you 'd come with me ? Rodney , I am going upstairs to get Tabatha and if you 're not gone when I come back down here I 'm going to do something terrible to you . And ruin your record ? Oh , I don 't need witchcraft . I 'll punch you in the nose . Just what I need . Phase one of Operation Split-Up coming up . Oh , I 'm Harriet Kravitz from across the street . Hi , honey . I found this in the kitchen . I guess Gladys borrowed it from Mrs. Stephens . I 'll take it . Sam 's slipping into something more comfortable . We 're gonna have a little snort together . Are you a friend of Mr. Stephens ? Well , more a friend of Sam 's . Listen , honey , I 'd love to gab but I 'm kind of busy right now . Know what I mean ? - Bye . - Bye . Mutual trust indeed . Phase two of Operation Split-Up coming up . Rodney . Rodney ? Well , Tabatha , looks like our home-wrecking friend finally got the message and gave up , huh ? Are you sure it 's the same dog , Mr. Entwhistle ? The description in the ad sounded just like him . He 's very friendly and ... Oh , yes , he ... He loves chocolate cake . That 's him all right . You sound disappointed . Well , I 've grown very fond of that dog . Truthfully , I was hoping nobody would claim him so that we could keep him . Well , perhaps that might be arranged . Yes . My sister and I are moving to London soon . I 'd hate to lose him , but it would be difficult to take him with us . - Would you be willing to sell him ? - Well , look I 'm meeting my sister at 7 for dinner . Let me talk it over with her , and I 'll drop by your house later tonight and tell you our decision . - Good . I hope you can convince her . That dog is really something special , Mr. Entwhistle . Yes . Well , you 're very perceptive , Mr. Stephens . It 's the strangest thing . I suddenly had this terrific craving for chocolate éclairs . I mean , I just had to have a chocolate éclair . Isn 't that odd ? I think that happens to all of us at sometime or another , Ms. Kravitz . I suppose Mrs. Stephens asked you to stop by and pick up something for your company . - Company ? - I met him quite by accident . Unfortunately , I called at a very bad time . He was still in his robe and pyjamas when he answered the door . He said they were just having a snort together . - Is he a friend of yours , Mr. Stephens ? - I don 't know . I suppose someone dropped in , and Sam hasn 't had time to tell me . Well , I must say your faith in your wife is very touching , Mr. Stephens . Miss Kravitz . Aren 't you going to buy some éclairs ? Éclairs ? I hate éclairs . In fact , I don 't even know why I came in here . Hi , there . Oh , no . Now , listen , Rodney no more Mrs. Nice Guy . When Darrin comes home , I 'm gonna tell him exactly who you are . And I 'm warning you , he can be very violent . No , you don 't wanna spoil your record when you 're so close . Besides , you have my solemn oath that if you are still together by 9 : 00 tonight I 'll fly out of your lives forever . Still together ? Did you put a spell on Darrin ? Oh , Samantha , you know my powers are too meagre to cause a rift between you two by witchcraft . I just wanna be around you for another 45 minutes . That 's all , Samantha . Is that too much to ask ? Honey , open the door . I 've got my hands full . My master 's voice . Just a minute , sweetheart . Thank you . Hey , it 's nice to have someone like you welcome me when I get home . Nice to have someone like you welcome me . Not necessarily in that order , I hope . No . I just think you look sensational . - I brought dessert . - Thank you . Dinner should be ready in a little while . Good . Just the two of us ? Well , this was our celebration . Didn 't you wanna be alone ? Oh , sure . It 's just that sometimes friends drop in unexpectedly , that 's all . No . No , no friends . You want a snort ? Drink ? Love one . So you 've just been puttering around the house on your own , huh ? Darrin , I think there 's something I should tell you . I thought so . You 've just mixed 4 ounces of Scotch with 2 ounces of gin . - Is that all ? - No . When you wanna find out something from me , just ask . Not very subtle , huh ? Okay . I bumped into Harriet Kravitz today and she said that you and a man in a dressing gown were having a snort together . Well , that 's ridiculous . - Then it 's not true ? - No . Then why would she say it ? I don 't know . Honey , don 't misunderstand me . I trust you implicitly . It 's just that I do get a bit confused . Now , are you sure that there wasn 't a man here today in his pyjamas and robe ? Darrin , that isn 't exactly the kind of thing that would slip my mind . Did she say she actually saw us ? She said the man answered the door , and he said ... What is it ? Well , Darrin , I wasn 't gonna tell you this . And I don 't think you 're gonna like it , but ... Honey , I 'm sure there 's a perfectly logical explanation . Now , who was he ? Him . The dog ? In pyjamas and robe ? Okay , very funny . Now , who was he ? No . Darrin , it was the dog . I didn 't wanna tell you , because I didn 't wanna spoil our celebration . Actually , he 's a warlock I used to babysit with . - The dog ? - He came to see me yesterday morning . I know it sounds ridiculous , but he thinks he 's in love with me . The dog ? Darrin , I 'm trying to tell you that that is not a dog . He just posed as a lost dog . That 's why I didn 't want you to send that ad in because I knew nobody would claim him . Because he 's a warlock ? Darrin , I 'm telling the truth . Look , I 'll prove it . All right , Rodney , he knows . Change back . Oh , he 's just being stubborn . Stop playing games , Rodney . Turn back . He knows I won 't use any witchcraft on him . Rodney , if you don 't turn back right this minute I 'll hit you with my shoe . - Sam , you 'll scare him . Right out of his hide , I hope . Sam , don 't you think it would be easier just to tell the truth ? Darrin , don 't you believe me ? No , I don 't . I happen to know that dog is not a warlock . - How ? - Because his owner came to my office this afternoon . - What ? - And he 's a very nice young man . He may even sell me this dog . Oh , Darrin , don 't you see ? - That 's Rodney too . - Yes , I do see . You want me to believe that this poor , helpless animal is your friend a dog and his owner , all at the same time . Well , Darrin , Rodney 's very devious . Sam , aren 't you being unfair ? - Unfair ? - You 're trying to put the blame on this dog because you don 't like him . Don 't deny it . You never did like him . You even said that he fawned . - You don 't trust me . - Yes , I do trust you . I just resent your trying to blame this poor , innocent animal . Now , will you please tell me the truth ? I 'm not going to tell you anything . I don 't even wanna speak to you . Well , in that case , I 'm going to bed . I don 't care what you do . In the den . Come on , fella . Bed ? It 's only 8 : 30 . Imagine her trying to put the blame on a poor dog like you . Well , looks like I need an extra blanket . I 'll go get it . You just make yourself comfortable . Boy , am I beat . I 'm gonna fall asleep just as soon as my head hits that pillow . Good night , dog . - I got you ! - No , don 't hit me . Samantha ! Don 't hit me . Samantha ! Well , well . What do you think of man 's best friend now ? Never mind what he thinks of me . - What about what he thinks of you ? - Stay out of this . You said your marriage was based on mutual trust and respect . I proved you were wrong . He didn 't believe you were telling the truth . Yes , I did . - You did ? - Yes . Just once , I wanted to win out over witchcraft without any help from you . Besides , I didn 't want you to spoil your record . - He 's lying . - That 's why I went to bed at 8 : 30 . You don 't know how happy I am to hear you say that . Thank you , sweetheart . Pardon me . Does this mean that you 're not coming away with me ? Sam , will you excuse me for just a minute ? - What are you gonna do ? - I 'm gonna punch you in the nose . How long is he going to stay this way ? It 's just one of his old tricks . He knows you won 't hit a dumb animal . I 'm going to call the pound . That won 't work . Mr. Stephens ? I saw your ad . I 've come to claim my dog . Well , I think there must be some mistake . Oh , no mistake . I recognized the description . There he is . Now , Rodney , you come out of there . - Rodney ? - This is Rodney 's mother , darling . You may not remember me . I 'm Samantha . Samantha ? My , how you 've changed . Oh , he 's lonely , you know ? He 's always looking for a playmate . - So I gather . - He 's not really bad . He 's just mischievous . How are you gonna get him to change back ? Oh , that 's easy . Rodney , if you don 't change back I 'll give you a flea-and-tick bath . Come on , Rodney , it 's way past your bedtime . Goodbye , my love . I shall return . - Oh , no , you won 't . - Don 't bother to show us out . Goodbye , now . Would 've loved to have seen that tick-and-flea bath . Well , you still think I 'm entitled to a celebration ? You didn 't use witchcraft . Well , with him gone , we really have something to celebrate . I 'll drink to that . Sam , water . Oh , Sam . - What ? - You broke your record . Well , there 's always next month . Subtitles by SDI Media Group

 ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) NARRATOR : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) CHARLES : The money is the deal . Mr. Charles , please , I can get you the money . Garrison , you 're a loser . If I let you off easy , people gonna think of me as a loser . That 's unacceptable . When I get the back door covered , we move . Come on Mr. Charles . You know I 'm good for the money . CHARLES : That isn 't the point . It 's too late . Mr. Charles , please . I just need a week , that 's all . This is a waste of time . Please , give me a chance . Scotty , I 'm sorry , I got a business to run . CHARLES : And you 're a liability . ( GUNSHOT ) Freeze , police ! ROSS : What you 're describing is first-degree murder . GEORGE : I 'm describing what I saw . My client , Mr. Charles , will testify Garrison pulled the gun on him . A struggle ensued , the pistol accidentally discharged . That 's not what happened . You 'd better come up with something to substantiate your client 's fantasy ... Jeff , or I 'll nail him the minute we get a jury . Why would Chester Charles , a respected businessman ... Oh , please . He fronts an import business that runs everything from guns to dirty drug money . I don 't believe any charges have been filed on those allegations . We 're working on it . I suggest you work on coming up with a reason ... my client , suddenly , without provocation , allegedly ... pulled a weapon and gunned down his associate . He said Garrison was bad for business . He said ? You heard their conversation 200 feet away ? Officer Rankin , the bald-headed gentleman in the corner ... has just asked his partner , Officer Jennings for a cup of coffee . No sugar . " And ... " " Jen , toss me a booking slip on the way . " They 're a little keener with the senses than we are . That 's all . Gentlemen , we 'll see you in court . Good work , Francisco . We got a trial date yet , Anderson ? Yeah , jury selection begins next week . Okay , I 'll loosen up Francisco 's calendar . This should work out nicely considering your condition . I 'm due to accept a pod any day , now . Congratulations . I didn 't know you and Susan were pregnant . Oh yes , we 're very excited . You look great . Thank you . Must be a female , huh ? Yeah , okay . That 's all , gentlemen . George , you got a minute ? Yes , of course . You know city attorney Bud Anderson . Yeah , hi . How did the deposition go ? As expected . George 's testimony should put Charles away for a long time . All right . Knock ' em dead , George . You write that down . That 's another useful expression . It means , to do a good job . Nice meeting you , Bud . I really need to talk to my partner . Yes , of course . Thanks again . And congratulations . Thank you . " Knock ' em dead . " A little violent , but has a nice thing to it . " Ring . " So , George , this trip to the ejection center ... Yeah , Susan will be here any minute . Yeah , you really think I should be there ? Of course . Godfather . Yeah , now , there 's another thing we need to talk about . Yes , that 's a good idea . Susan and I very much want to embrace the Earthly tradition but ... we were quite troubled when we read the book . The book ? You read The Godfather ? We thought they carried the concept of an honorable guardian a bit too far . Yeah , I 'm not really into dead fish and horse 's heads . Susan will be relieved to hear that . She was having doubts about having a godfather . Well , now , let 's not drop that idea . Hi . Ready to go ? All set . Did you ask about the ... Yes . No dead fish , no offers that can 't be refused . Well , shall we , godfather ? It 's so peaceful . Well , this is it , Matthew . This is one hell of a lobby . This is where we 're going to transfer our pod . You can 't have a baby in a lobby . KEN : How are we doing ? SUSAN : It 's perfect . I also have an Oasis or a Great Plains available . No . No need to look any further . This is perfect . This is an ejection room ? Isn 't it wonderful ? Yeah , I 'll get the marshmallows and weenies . The environment is very important for the ejection of the pod . This space gives us the tranquility necessary to focus on our delivery . MATT : What are you going to do ? Roll in the dirt ? Well , I hope we 'll use the ejection cradle . Several pods have been quite peacefully transferred , from right here . George , it 's wonderful . We 'll trim the trees ... and make sure all the animals are fed and have everything ready to go . Your two children will be attending ? Yes . Mr. Sikes ? ( GEORGE AND SUSAN GROANING ) I don 't know . I think we got a problem here or something . It 's contractions . George , cut it out . We are biologically in sync . I 'm experiencing the same as Susan . Look George , are you gonna be having these cramps a lot ? Because that was really embarrassing in the weapons locker . That was just the pod rotating for ejection . I shouldn 't have any more embarrassing moments until after the ejection . What happens then ? Guess who or I 'll blow your socks off . It couldn 't be an old cop with two bum knees ? I prefer " seasoned " to " old . " Theo , how are you ? How do I look ? Seasoned . Hey , George Francisco ... I want you to meet the guy who taught me everything I know about being a cop . Theo Miles . Yeah , somebody had to break in the rook . The guys drew straws and I lost . What are you doing around here ? Haven 't you seen the memo ? What ? The mass drug crackdown . Memo 62785 . Yes , of course . An inter-divisional program ... to coordinate individual drug arrests into a joint super-prosecution . Yeah , 62785 . Yeah , I 've been popping into divisions all over town ... getting the best men hitting the hottest leads . Got a nice little one down here . You interested ? Sounds like another job for the canines ! You 'll love this , George . This is great . I was still in uniform , and I get stuck with this guy in an alley . The big hotshot detective . We had six armed punks cornered , waiting for backup . And they were ready to make a break ... when Sikes started barking like a dog . Me ? You started it . I was just following the detective 's lead . Damned if it didn 't fool them long enough for backups to arrive . Those idiots . They were more afraid of dogs than cops . Say , what do you say ? You in on this bust ? ( MATT BARKS ) This guy never changes . Hey George , come on . You 're not gonna bust anybody standing around your desk . ( GEORGE GROANING ) Is he okay ? Yeah . He 's just expecting . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Let 's go . RICKMAN : How 's it going , Haney ? Did it go okay ? Piece of cake . Check it out . 100 % pure . One ounce cuts a 1,000 times . We got ourself a gold mine . Police ! Everybody take it easy and keep your hands up . Freeze . Haney . I got a bad feeling . Theo . You 're as crazy as ever . The guy would have hammered you . I didn 't see you moving . I was following your lead . My knee locked on me . I was waiting for you to push me out of the way like I taught you . Are you two all right ? I forgot about your knee . I don 't tell you these things for nothing . By the way , did I tell you I 'm retiring ? You 're throwing me a party . The briefcase is clean . It 's already weighed . Here 's the receipt . You mind putting a seal on it and drop it off in the evidence room ? Yes , of course . While you 're at it , why don 't you drop off that scale , too ? Are you coming ? You mind if I borrow this guy ? We 've got some old times to catch up on . I need the weighing receipt . Right here . That 's not right . No , you 're seven grams short . Where did it go ? It 's probably just the scales . I 'll have them calibrated . Hey . It happens all the time . Just relax . Well , I can 't believe that Theo Miles is hanging up his badge . Ten days and it goes in a box with my Eagle Scout uniform . You excited ? Hell , I don 't know . You look good , Theo . Give me a break . I look like a guy who 's had 35 years with bullets flying at him ... a couple of marriages that cleaned the bank ... and a nice long affair with Miss Wallop here . So , what are you gonna do ? You stay in the same place too long , somebody 's going to shoot you . Same old Miles . Look , kid , I 've taught you a lot . How to make it on the streets . How to dance around the bureaucratic crap . Hell , I even taught you how to live . Don 't make the same mistakes I made . What mistakes ? Don 't let 35 years jump on top of you . I promise . You 're a good kid . Got to tell you ... best rook I ever trained . Get out of here . Would I lie to the best man at my third wedding ? I was just the best man 'cause your brother didn 't show up . That 's just the story I told you . I don 't have a brother . If you knew that , you would have ducked out on me . You really don 't have a brother ? What are you doing ? Twisting my nipples . Come on , George , I got to work with you . My nipples need strengthening for the attachment . So you can play with them in the john . I 'm sorry if I 'm embarrassing you . Francisco . In here , now . See . I 'm not the only one against public nipple-twisting . George Francisco , Sgt. Dustin Baxley , Internal Affairs . It 's nice to meet you . I 'm afraid , this isn 't a pleasure call . There 's a seven-gram discrepancy in the weight from yesterday 's seizure . Yes . I pointed that out to the officer . We recalibrated both scales and they match . What does that mean ? That $ 300,000 worth of jack disappeared ... between the crime scene and the police station . Where did it go ? I 'm afraid this is a very serious matter , George . Until investigation is completed , you 're confined to desk duty . George . Neemu , are you all right ? I 'm fine . I just couldn 't sleep . You feeling okay ? Yes . I must have had a contraction or something and woke up . We haven 't had a contraction all night . I told the kids about the ejection center . They 're very excited . It will be wonderful . Susan , you should go up to bed . Susan , please , just let me work this out . Everything will be fine . I promise . Well , then hold me . Hey , Bobby . Thanks for the doughnut . No one gave me a doughnut . You want one ? He put three in my locker . No , I don 't want one . Did you see that ? Jenkins didn 't even say hello to me . He always says hello to me . He was reading a file . What 's with the paranoia rush ? I 'm not being paranoid . I 'm just being given the cold soldier . It 's " shoulder . " And no , you 're not . Look , by tonight , they 'll realize they screwed up somehow . This will all be behind you . I know that . But until they do , I 'm confined to desk duty ... while my colleagues find nothing better to do with their time than stare at me . Cut it out . Couple of guys are playing with you . Relax . Is Susan taking this better than you are ? Of course she is . I haven 't told her . What am I going to do ? I can 't eat , I can 't sleep , all I do is worry . I worry about Susan , I worry about Buck and Emily . I worry about the negative effect of worrying on my ling pod flap . That 's a lot of worrying . Yes , it is . And I 'm worried about it . Look , you want me to talk to Grazer ? Find out what 's going on ? I 'm capable of talking to our Captain . But you don 't know how to humiliate him into telling you what 's going on . I would appreciate anything you could do . No problem . George . I 'm glad you 're here . I need you to go over the deposition you gave to Chester Charles ' attorney . Why ? I told the truth . I know . I just want to make sure it was recorded properly . You are my key witness . Of course . Everyone wants to make sure of me lately . I can 't believe you don 't know anything . You had cocktails with the deputy chief last night . How did you know that ? I looked at your calendar . Look Sikes . They 're not gonna tell me anything . Francisco 's one of my men . The whole division becomes suspect . You know how IA operates . You really don 't know anything ? Believe it or not , if I did , I 'd tell you . Really ? I 'm not the enemy here , Sikes . Hey , kid , what 's going on ? You heard about George ? Yeah , I heard IA was crawling up everybody 's back . Look , I 'm really sorry . You 're sorry ? I was in on this thing . I could have screwed up . Please , I get enough paranoia from my partner . Seven stupid grams . That 's $ 300,000 , $ 400,000 on the street after it 's cut . Where did it go ? Look , I got to go in and take it on this one . Hell , there 's a dozen reasons . I could have misread the scales . Theo , you don 't make mistakes . Look , I got nine days to bump around on this job ... I 'd hate to be watching the stripper at my retirement party with any doubts . Theo , you didn 't screw up . Hey , kid , what did I tell you about hard evidence ? " It 's a hell of a lot better than a man 's word . " That punk we busted said that the guy that tried to run us down is named Haney . Lawrence Haney . I got a bulletin out on him . He 's worth more than a bulletin . He can tell us exactly how much jack there was . Find him and your partner 's back on the streets . WHELAN : What 's running hot out at the track ? Pretty Boy Whelan ? You got a permit for this ? Who the hell are you ? He works with me . I thought you were dead or something . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , Pretty Boy . I 'm about to retire and I 'm cashing all my old favors . Yeah , well , I don 't owe you nothing . Want me to bust him for the concealed weapon ? Did you end up playing housewife with some con after the last time I sent you up ? What do you want ? We 're looking for Lawrence Haney . Have fun . You push his jack on the street ? I ain 't pushing nothing . That 's not what we heard . I ain 't seen Haney in a week . Where was he when you saw him ? Stick it . Mustache makes you look a lot more mature than you act . I 'll nail your ass if you start messing with me . Did I mention that after I retire I plan on becoming a barber ? Son of a bitch . All right . Hangs down at a hotel down on Third Street . INSTRUCTOR : ( ON TV ) To the left , two , three , four . To the right , two , stretch , four . No pain , no gain . That 's it , come on . Are you all right ? No , Dad , I 'm not all right . I 'm having birth pains again . The pains you 're feeling , they 're not real . It 's just a sympathetic reaction to what I 'm going through . ( BOTH GRUNTING PAINFULLY ) You see ? Now I am starting to react to your pains . Perhaps you 'd like to do my Peter Fonda workout with me . It 's designed to relieve pain . That 's okay , Dad . You handle pain your way , I 'll handle it my way . ... into the inner folds of the ling pod flaps . We 're going to work on your sack . And begin . To the left , two , three , four . To the right , two , three , four . Never have to say " ouch , " if you work to stretch your pouch . Dad . I think I 'm gonna blow chunks . Stay with it . We 're almost there . And one , two , three , four . And two , two , three , four . And three ... ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Yes , hello . What are you doing home ? I thought it would be best for the other officers ' concentration . You 're still on that paranoid trip . Why are you calling , Matthew ? Good news , Theo and I ... Theo ? Detective Miles . We teamed so we can catch that guy who bolted from the bust . Yeah . We got a pretty good lead on this Haney guy . That should clear up a lot . Why don 't you swing by and pick me up ? I want to go with you . You can 't go . What do you mean , I can 't go ? I 've got to go . No , you don 't . Relax . Stay home . Take care of the baby . The pod is fine . Matthew , this is my career . I want to go . Look , we 're up to speed on this , you 're not . We don 't want anything to jeopardize this bust , do we ? Who 's this " we " ? Me and you . Who else would I be talking about ? Come on , kid . Kid ? What ? We 've got a history , George . What 're you , jealous ? No , I 'm emotional . I know . It 'll be okay . I 'll call you in a little while . MAN : How you doing , Haney ? Bill . Come on , Bill , I need my mail . Let 's go . Don 't even blink . You okay ? Couldn 't be better . Want your nippers ? No , please . Do you think we 'll ever get our appetites back ? Can I be excused ? Try to eat a little something . Come on , Buck , it 's really good . All slippery and slimy . Mom , Dad , I can 't take this anymore . What a wimp . Yeah ? Well , if you women went through anything like us men go through ... there probably wouldn 't be any babies at all . Right , dad ? You think my dilation sickness is any less painful than your father 's ? I just know I got to lie down . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) I 'll get it . What is this ? I 'm sure you 've seen one before , Detective . It 's a search warrant . I 'll show you , Rankin , start your search . Matthew , what is going on ? I 'm sorry , we did everything we could . We brought Haney in . He confirmed the amount counted at the bust . Amount of what ? Jack . They think I stole drugs . My father 's a policeman . Everybody , just stay were you are . This won 't take long . Mingo , Franklin start in the kitchen and work your way back here . You can 't do this . What are they doing ? Sit down , lady . They can 't do this . Put that picture down . Get your hands off my mother . Take it easy . It 's all right . It 's okay . Emily . This isn 't a slave ship , George . It 's our home . Take it easy , everybody . I know this is tough , but they have to search the house . It 's procedure . Mom , I 'm scared . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Take it easy in there . Stay here . Sit down . You 're giving me the creeps . Sorry , I 'm thinking . I have to keep walking when I think . I said sit , Slag . Please , I 'm expecting . Walking helps . Isn 't that sweet ? The little lady is expecting , boys . Sit down , mother . I know George . He wouldn 't do it . Couldn 't do it . You know he didn 't do it . Captain . What do you want me to say ? I just don 't know . You don 't know ? Back off , Sikes . No , I won 't back off . You work with a man every day , you get to know what kind of person he is . Damn it , Sikes . They found the jack in his house . The chemical analysis was the same as the jack from the bust . Then somebody planted it there . Something . He didn 't take it . Somebody 's got to prove that . Thanks for your concern . What about bail ? What about it ? He 's got rights , Baxley . All right , Sikes , put a lid on it . Yeah . Look , he 's a cop . The courts have to be a lot tougher when we break the rules . Or do they have to be tougher because this cop has spots ? Well , the Newcomer Advocacy League used some leverage . Considering George 's condition , they got a judge to set bail . Thank God for pregnant men . Where 's George Francisco ? I 'm right here , Matthew . Come on , you 're out of here . It 's about time . What happened to him ? He just came down with a bad case of the creeps . GEORGE : I was set up and I know it . Of course you were . And I know by whom . Okay . You 're monitored . It 's funny how the universe is so small . This tracking device is very much like what the ... overseers used on us at mining camps . Look , George , I 'm sorry . It 's the law . At least until the preliminary hearing . Yes , of course . I understand . George . Glad to see you 're out . Why ? Why did you do it ? What are you talking about ? I think you know exactly what I 'm talking about . You and I were the only ones who handled that jack . I checked , and I assure you I didn 't take it ! Do you hear what I 'm saying ? Kid , could use a little help here . George , that 's enough . Damn it ! Cut it out . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . It 's no big deal . My life is no big deal ? Come on . I 'm taking you home . Susan will be here any moment . If you need me , you know where to find me . INSTRUCTOR : Three , two , three , four . Stretch those spots till they 're sore . And one , two , three , four , breathe ... Why don 't you come and join me , George ? In , two , three , four , and out ... Not till after the baby . Susan , I am so frustrated . What are we going to do ? If I have to go to jail , I ... You 're not going to jail , George . I don 't know that . I don 't even know if I 'll be reinstated . If you 're not , we 'll survive . But as what ? I can 't let this happen . Then it won 't . You 've gone further and worked harder than so many , Stanya . You 'll get past this . We all will . ( DOOR OPENING ) Dad , your partner 's here . Hi . Matthew . I got some of your junk together . I thought you might want it . You know how the clowns at the station like to rip stuff off . Thank you . It 's kind of heavy . It 's okay . I 'll just take this upstairs . So how are you doing ? As well as expected . Look ... I just want you to know , I think you got Theo all wrong . He understands what you 're going through . I 'm sorry , Matthew . I want you to understand what I 'm going through . I do . Do you think I took seven grams of jack ... and was stupid enough to keep it in my own house ? No , of course I don 't . Well , somebody took that jack . And somebody planted it in my house . And that somebody is Theo Miles . Look , he pulled me off the streets . Got me through the academy . Treated me like his own . And haven 't you forgot about something ? Like a motive ? What does he have to gain by getting you put away ? You . Sikes , get your butt in my office . What ? This just came in from the city attorney 's office . That slimeball attorney of Chester Charles' is going to file for a dismissal ... on the grounds that our witness , George , is up on a felony count himself . Can he do that ? Not only can he do it . He can make it stand up . Well , let 's get Bud Anderson to fight it . I just got off the phone with him . He doesn 't think it would be worth the effort . Charles blew away his partner in cold blood . What the hell does he want ? Some legal system . A felon walks while an innocent cop gets put away . Yeah , you heard me . I think George is innocent . Look , would you break the news to him ? Sure . Charles sure is a lucky guy . Yeah , maybe just a little too lucky . Get on it . There you go . Thank you . Hey , kid , I 've been looking for you . What 's going down ? I got a bust set up . Getting close to retire-day . How about coming along and protecting my backside ? You getting superstitious all of a sudden ? Yeah , I guess I am . Well , count me in . Give me some advice . Shoot . It 's about George . Yeah , how 's he holding up ? Good . I think he 's being framed . I think I know by who . Chester Charles . Do you mean that guy that George is going to testify against ? You mean , was going to testify against . With George discredited , Charles walks . You got anything to back up this theory of yours ? Not really . How hard would it be to arrange a sting like that ? Pay somebody off from the department to set up the bust ... then plant the jack at George 's house ? That 'd be nothing for a guy like Charles . You might be on to something . You tell anybody else about this ? What good would it do ? I don 't have any proof . Well , you 've got to do something . What would you do ? Plant somebody in the cell with Charles . He may do something or say something . It 's worth a shot . It 's a good idea . Thanks , Theo . If I don 't have all the information , how do you expect me to solve the problem ? My teacher says everything you need is in each problem . " A train leaves Los Angeles at 10 : 30 am . traveling east at ... " 20 km per hour . " Well , what are the weather conditions ? If it 's raining , it can 't sustain that speed . What difference does it make ? I think it 's sunny . Weather makes a big difference in ... train travel . ( DOORBELL RINGS ) I 'll get the door . What are you doing home ? I got in a fight . It 's not easy being the daughter of a corrupt Slag cop . You got in a fight ? Some dumb clod football player . I barely touched him . Emily , why don 't you go upstairs and finish your homework ? I 'm not taking it so well . Starting to feel so dirty . My family looks at me , and this , and ... The memories it brings back for all of us . I know it 's not easy , but hang in there . I 'm sorry about yesterday , Matt . I didn 't mean to attack your friend . It 's just more than I can handle . Forget it . You had every right going after Miles . Why ? He couldn 't . He is , George . And I 'm gonna prove it . I 'm sorry . It 's not like he was my father or anything . Oh , no , Matthew . To you he was much more than a father . If there 's anything I can do . I got to do this alone . And , call me if anything starts happening . Remember , I 'm the godfather . Hey , what the hell are you doing ? We got a bust . Chop-chop . We need to talk , Miles . How about after we hit the crack house so this warrant doesn 't go cold ? I want to do it now . How much did Chester Charles pay you ? You set George up to discredit him . With him bounced off the force , Chester Charles goes free . Do you really believe that ? When I told you I wanted to set Charles up ... you ran to his attorney . I tailed you . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Huh ? What are you doing ? You 're the guy who taught me everything . I taught you one thing . How to survive , Sikes . You were at the bust . You were at George 's . And the money ? You live high and hard , Theo . You know you never saved a dime . Give me 24 hours . You know , I watched your back for a year . I carried you home when you used to get smashed down at Casey 's . We even cried together . Who is it ? An old partner of yours ? I screw up a lot , kid . You know that . What 's done is done . What about my partner ? He 'll survive . What about me ? Miles , please don 't do this . Don 't walk away from me . Look , I 'm not Mister Perfect . Take me off that damn pedestal you got me on . I 'm a beat-up old cop trying to find a couple of good years . That 's all I am ... and all I ever was . I love you like my own . You know that . Well , work it out , kid . So what do we do now ? I say that 's up to you . The suspect lives alone . I read the report . Then you know he 's armed . He may have even booby-trapped the place . Watch your step . Yeah . Sure . I 'm taking the front . In 30 . MILES : Police , freeze . Oh , man . It looks like I had my last call after all . Take it easy . I 'll get a paramedic . Hey . I taught you more than survival , didn 't I , kid ? Yeah , you did , Theo . A whole lot more . Theo ... don 't take George with you . My desk at home . Bank receipt ... trace it . I 'm sorry . Partners ? Partners . How did it go ? Jury took less than an hour . Charles got life . How about you ? You know me at funerals . I said my goodbyes . I 'll be okay . Matthew , everything you did , I ... I can never feel what you feel . But I 'll never forget what you 've done . Let it ride , George . I just wish there was something I could do for you . Be a good cop . You can count on it . ( GEORGE GASPING IN PAIN ) What is it ? My ling pod flap just dropped . Is that good ? It is if I get to the ejection center quickly . It 's the big one . I 'll call Susan . No , we 're biologically in sync . That 's right . She knows . Would you drive me to the center ? Me ? Yes . Right . Sure . Murdock , check George and me out . We 're going to have a baby , or something . So far , Matthew , you 're doing an excellent job . Okay , how we doing ? They 're focusing . Well , here 's the Bing Bang oil . Bin Yin . And please , just try to absorb the mood we have created . Yeah , I 'm gonna go absorb the hallway . Please . Stay . ( GEORGE AND SUSAN GASP ) It 's time . Oh , jeez . The Bin Yin is the oil of Celine . It 's just for the blessing . Great . We need the charcoal powder , now . Right , George . Do you need the mallet ? No , we 're fine . George , it is a girl . Amen .

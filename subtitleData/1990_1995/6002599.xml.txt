 Warden Peters , report to administration . Warden Peters , report to administration . Oh , boy , it 's lunchtime . I love prison food . That 's why I love being in prison because of the prison food . How much time do I have ? Three minutes ? More than enough time . I 'll have coffee afterwards . I just love prison food . It 's delicious prison food . Whoops , I dropped my tray . Not a smart thing to do in prison . Hey , Clarkster , you home ? Hey man , look what we got in the mail ? You got one too . Who would send us a present ? One of those new portable video games . Ha , this is great . Clark , aren 't you gonna try yours ? I wish I could , but I got a deadline . You two guys have fun . Oh , company . I love company . Oh , Nick Knack , I 'm so glad to see you . Oh , I 'm glad to be back . And I 'm sorry . Oh , I forgive you . Oh , ho , ho . Oh , oh , my back , my back . Please , let me go , let me go , let me go , let me go . Let me go . I forgive you , all right ? Uh-huh . And I 'd like to show you my latest invention . Oh , I 'm so happy you forgive me for letting Superboy go that time . Oh , here , make yourself comfortable . Sit down . Now , I 'll bring us something to eat in a little while . Here , let me put you in here . I don 't want you to fall out . I 'm very concerned with you , you know . What are you doing , Nick Knack ? Oh , nothing , here , I just think you might ... Oh , straps are tight . Well , they have to be . I can 't move , Nick Knack . Don 't you see , you 're going to be part of an experiment . You 're going to test out my mind probe machine . Yeah . Boy , I don 't wanna see my electric bill this month . My brain . It hurts . It 's heating me . Well , Superboy , now you 'll know what it 's like to be the little weakling nerd who no one likes to play with . My mind . It 's hurting . Don 't worry about it . I just wanna see how much a person can take before my mind probe machine kills them . It 's draining me . You mean my little Nick Knack could be a hurt little Nick Knack ? I 'm afraid so . Well , then I better untie you right away , so that you can save him . No , you 're draining the battery . Oh , you ruined everything , Superboy . But I 'll get you yet , if it 's the last thing I do . Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh . Oops . Daisy , Daisy . She 's dead . Less than a minute . I 'll have to adjust it for Superboy 's friends . Well , Daisy , my dear , I 've lost you . But I 've got an idea . Andy 's emporium . If I don 't have it , I can get it . Give me Clark Kent . He 's out . Then get this , it 's me , Nick Knack . What ? Oh , please be a racecar and race over to my place . Vroom . Vroom , vroom . Vroooooooommmmm . Eeerrrttt . Vroom , vroooooommm . Hello ? I 'm back . - It 's the Toy Master . - Nick Knack ? Be a sweet for Nick Knack and come on over as a toy train . Toot , toot . Choo , choo , choo , choo , choo , choo . Oh , oh , Daisy . I can 't believe it . It ... You 're better than the original one . You 're a new improved Daisy . It 's alive . It 's alive . I 'm so melodramatic . Yes , Nick Knack , I will help you . Very good , Daisy . Oh , Daisy , why don 't you be a real doll and answer that . Yes , in a few minutes . Vroom , vroom , vroooommm . Toot , toot , choo , choo , choo , choo . Choo , choo , choo , choo . It worked , Nick Knack , it worked perfectly . Well , of course it did . It 's post-hypnotic suggestion . It couldn 't have failed . Vrrooom . Choo , choo , choo , choo . Toot , toot . Stop . Go to your chairs . Okay , Daisy , as soon as you 're through with that you 'll get some popcorn . And keep trying to get in touch with Clark Kent as I ready the mind probe machine . With it , I can see every one of their thoughts and learn every secret about Superboy . Secrets that will help me defeat Superboy for good . All right . When the sand runs out , I 'll know all of their thoughts . And then both of them will be dead . Andy ? They seem to be completely under the hypnosis , Nick Knack . Good . I 'll start with the girl , first . Oh , Lana . Lana Lang . Can you hear me ? Is there something that could hurt Superboy ? Green kryptonite . Everybody knows that . What else can hurt him ? Red kryptonite . Very good . Red kryptonite made him bad . - That you and I ? - Yeah . With a little luck , we could be running this country in one month . Yeah . Yeah and I got the perfect plan . Hm , spill it . We take that military base tomorrow . You think I could ever team up with a loser like you ? Once you 're out of the way , nothing can stand in my way . Nothing . Superboy , don 't . We can help you . No , we can 't . Do it . Kill him . I ... I can 't . Oh , good . I can 't . I can 't kill . Where am I ? I don 't remember anything . Yeah , but that wasn 't Superboy 's fault . I need more information . More information . I have to probe deeper . I 'm probing deeper . They 're in pain , Nick Knack . Something 's happening to them . I know they 're in pain . I 'm putting them in pain . I 'm draining their minds of all their thoughts . And they 'd better start talking quick because in less than an hour , they 'll both be dead . I think I 'll go with the boy , this time . Oh , Andy , do you know anything about Superboy 's weaknesses ? You know anything that could take his power away ? Oh . It came from over there , somewhere . I saw it . Are you okay ? I can 't fly . Now , I have enough power to leave this planet and take you with me . Andy , look out . Power from an alien source . Do you know of anything else that could hurt Superboy ? Nick Knack , she 's getting weaker by the minute . I don 't care . In case you don 't know this , I happen to be a very mean person . Now , Lana , do you know anything about magic hurting Superboy ? Burn , nice boy , burn , burn . If I cannot have you , Superboy , no one else ever will . I will destroy you , as only my powerful magic can . No . I 've given you every chance . You 've had your turn . Now it 's time for you to burn . Oooaaaahhhhh . Burn , nice boy , burn . Burn , go to ashes . Look at that boy burning . I 'll get you . Your powers don 't cut it with me , Superboy . I 'm magic . Only magic can hurt me like it 's hurting you . I 'll use your magic heal on you . No , no , I feel the heat . Oh , oh , oh . That 's what I was counting on . Andy , remember me ? Do you know of anything much more powerful than magic that could hurt Superboy ? There ... There was a power , supernatural force . Aaaaahhhhhh . Byron . Nick knack , she could die . I don 't give a ... I 'm not concerned with that . It 'll all be part of my revenge against Superboy . Lana . Lana Lang , do you know of a power as strong as Superboy 's ? Huh , Lana ? A power as strong as Superboy 's . We are brothers . You are my enemy . Freeze where you are or we will open fire . People not welcome . You leave , now . I don 't wanna remember . Very good , she 's resisting . There 's something that she doesn 't want us to know . Would the groom put the ring on the bride 's finger . If there 's anyone present who objects to this wedding , let them speak now or forever hold his peace . I object . Superboy . Right on schedule . Ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah . That 's close enough , Superboy . He 's got the gun . Say cheese . You killed him . That was the plan , my dear wife . Oh , what a great story . I like that story . Daisy , didn 't you ? But Nick Knack , they could be dead . Only moments away . You will come to me at midnight . You will go to the char warehouse ... Post-hypnotic suggestion . ... when I call . Superboy . Your games are all over , Nick . How could you have found out ? Not a second too soon . Ah , what happened ? It 's all over for you now , Nick . The only thing you can ever count on is good guys always win . Captioned by Grant Brown

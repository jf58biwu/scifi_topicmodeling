 Roger your request for assistance , 50 . What is your location ? Unit 50 , go ahead . Suspect now westbound . Has entered the ship works off April Street . Unit 50 still in pursuit . Over . Unit 50 , I copy . Keep me advised . This is the police ! Pull your vehicle over and stop ! Stop your vehicle ! Put your hands on the roof and freeze ! Hold it ! On the ground ! Do it ! You hear me ? - Face down ! Do it ! - Stay there ! Stop ! Armed officer ! I hit him ! I know I hit him ! Where the hell did he go ? He 'll be bleeding bad . The Lipari Island group off the coast of Italy . But theirs is a very light lava , sir . Exactly . But inside there must be something the weight of the heaviest rock in existence . But , Professor , that would be Icelandic peridotite . Precisely . - There 's a piece chipped off . - By me . What was the rock inside ? Icelandic peridotite . When I saw this I stopped chipping . But how could a rock from Iceland ... Mulder . Are you watching Channel 8 ? .. across the world . What 's your conclusion ? Science does not jump to conclusions . It is not a guessing game . .. ship works , where a 60-mile high-speed car chase ended this evening . The suspect eluded capture by leaping into the harbour , but not before reportedly injuring several Ardis police officers . Captain Roy LaCerio is standing by . Captain , how did the man escape , and how seriously injured were the officers ? Those details are still unclear . I 'll be talking to ... - We need you , Captain . - You 'll have to excuse me . Captain Roy LaCerio being pulled away during an intense manhunt . Captain Roy LaCerio being pulled away during an intense ... Mulder , you 've been through this tape a hundred times . What exactly are you hoping to find ? I don 't know . And all he told you was to watch Channel 8 ? Yeah , that 's all he said . Do we even know why the suspect was being chased ? As far as I can tell , he wouldn 't pull over for a moving violation . That oughta put him on the Ten Most Wanted list . There 's gotta be something here . Some detail . Something we 're not seeing . How do you know he 's not yanking your chain , this Deep Throat guy ? - Why would he do that ? - He has lied to you by his own admission . He wouldn 't call if there wasn 't something here I 'm supposed to see . Something he wants me to see . Then what are you missing ? There were three different law enforcement agencies out here last night . Hunting a man on a moving violation ? It 's not Silence of the Lambs , but it 's what we do . The man in the photograph isn 't wearing a badge or uniform . He 's not one of yours ? No , sir . But like I said , it was a zoo out here . You said the suspect was shot . Any explanation why the body hasn 't been recovered ? Well , we got our search ongoing . Divers down there in shifts . We 're certain he will be found . It 's been almost 18 hours . Where could the body be ? There are cables and debris all over the bottom . This is a painstaking business . Can I ask what the fbi 's interest in this case would be ? The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive ... Really ? How 's that ? No description of the suspect 's been released . If you don 't mind , can we take a look at the car , please ? It 's been taken to the impound . The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency in Gaithersburg . They had no idea that the car was even missing . You know , Mulder , I think we 're wasting our time here . I don 't know what the hell I 'm supposed to find . You can 't make out the license plate in this photo . Scully , look at this ! What ? Look at the car in the photo . Look at the windshield . It 's not the same car . It 's called a caduceus . It 's sort of the adopted symbol of the medical profession . So probably only a doctor would have that on his car . I had the picture enhanced . The plate is different . 3-AYF . Fast forward . That 's all you can make out . The rest is obscured . Danny , it 's Mulder . I need you to run a Maryland plate . All I got is a partial . Registered to a doctor ... or used to be . Yeah , I 'll hold . - They switched cars on us and lied about it . - Why would they do that ? Maybe the real owner of the car has got something to hide . - Dr Berube ? - Yes ? We 're with the fbi . Can we have a minute of your time ? - l 'm actually very busy . - l 'm sorry . Are you aware that a car registered to you was involved in a high-speed chase in Ardis ? Excuse me ? - Doctor , do you own a silver Ciera ? - Yes ! - lt was used for what ? - A crime . - Were you aware it was missing ? - Not until you mentioned it . I have a housekeeper and she often uses the car. lt 's a second car ... Please ! They should not be excited . Nothing should be touched ! - l thought they were friendly . - They 're part of an experiment . What kind of experiment ? - Am I under some kind of suspicion ? - No . Then I think I 've answered all your questions . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have more work than time . Thank you . - Did he bite you ? - No , but he tried to . It 's almost five o 'clock . We should check with the housekeeper while we 're here . - No . - No ? What do you mean " no " ? I mean this has reached the point of absurdity , Mulder . We 're here on half a hunch , off of a cryptic phone call , chasing down a clue that 's based on speculation . That 's all we 've got . That 's all he 's given us . Who is this Deep Throat character ? We don 't know anything about him , what his name is , what he does ... His position is delicate . He has access to information . An indiscretion could expose him . You don 't know this isn 'tjust a game with him . He 's toying with you , rationing out the facts . You think he does it because he gets off on it ? No . I think he does it because you do . Calling it a night , Mr Mulder ? My mother usually likes me home before the streetlights come on . - l 'm surprised at you . - Why ? - Your level of commitment has diminished . - My level of commitment ? I 'd have expected you to work all night trying to put the pieces together . Maybe if you 'd given me something more to work with ... - l 've given you all I can . - A news report ? - And where has it led you ? - Not very far . It may be further than you realise . You know , from day one this has been on your terms . I 've gone along , been the dutiful son . Maybe this time we can cut the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap and you can save me the trouble . I fear you 've become too dependent on me . Let me tell you , I 've got plenty to do without chasing down your vague leads or trying to decode your circular logic . Maybe it 's you who 's become too dependent on me , on my willingness to play your games . - Mr Mulder ? - What ? Don 't give up on this one . Trust me . You 've never been closer . Closer to what ? Hello ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Working late tonight , Doctor ? What do you want here ? He 's alive , isn 't he ? - Has he contacted you ? - Please ... You 're going to have to leave . If you 're from the fbi , I 've already answered your questions ! What questions ? I had nothing to say to them . I have nothing to say to you . Where 's Dr Secare ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Please ... My work is very important . I must get on with my work . I 'm afraid ... your work is done . - Anybody see anything ? - No . Nothing . I 'm calling it off . Get those guys out of the water . Yes , sir . Shore to RC1 . Bring it in . - There 's nothing down there . - Three days ? Forget it . The county sheriffs office is conducting the investigation . On the preliminary reports it 's listed as a suicide . Suicide ? Yeah . They think that he trashed his lab and then killed himself . How ? Well , it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze around his neck and the other end to this gas outlet . Then he jumped . - l don 't suppose there were any witnesses ? - Nope . The man we met kept this place like he was waiting for Good Housekeeping to show up . I wouldn 't have thought he 'd do all this . Or a Greg Louganis out the window . I know . That gauze is troubling . It 's a bit too calculated , huh ? Almost as if someone wanted to make doubly sure he 'd break his neck before he hit the ground . What else do we know about Dr Berube ? Terrence Allen Berube . Harvard Med , 1974 . He was working on the Human Genome Project . Are you familiar with that ? Yeah , the mapping of all human genes . Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavour in the history of mankind . Right . But that 's nothing extraordinary . Thousands of scientists were working on that project . But only one who had a silver Ciera and went bungee jumping with gauze around his neck . Sorry , I 'm seeing the pieces , but I 'm not seeing the connection . Maybe we 're not seeing it because it can 't be seen . Not in any obvious way . What do you think this is ? I don 't know . - Can you find out for me ? - What are you gonna do ? See what else I can find out about Dr Terrence Allen Berube . OK , Mulder . But I 'm warning you ... lf this is monkey pee , you 're on your own . My first impression is it 's some kind of bacteria specimen . Can I ask you where you got it ? It was recovered at a crime scene . We 've come a long way from Colonel Mustard in the den with a rope ! I 'm expecting it 'll turn out to be nothing . No ! No , you 've definitely got something here . Wow ! Look at this ! What are they ? They 're the size of bacteria , but no bacteria l 've seen . How do you mean ? Most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth . These are ... I don 't know . Strange . - You can 't identify them ? - We could do a freeze fracture . Take a thin slice off and see what 's going on inside these babies . - lf you don 't mind waiting . - No . No , I 'll wait . Hi , Danny. it 's Mulder again . I got a number this time . 555-2804 , area code 301 . I need an address . A name , if you can get it for me . All right , I 'm at ... same prefix , 1517 . Thanks , Danny . - That was fast . - Terry ? is that you ? Yeah . Who 's this ? They shot me , Terry . Oh , God ... I 've been in the water for three days. I 'm hurt . - Where are you now ? - l 'm at a payphone . I 'm gonna pick you up . Where are you ? Terry ... Hello ? You OK ? Are you there ? Hello ? Hello ? This man 's been hurt . I think he needs medical attention . What 's the street ? - l 'm gonna call an ambulance . - Sir ? Don 't hang up . - l got it . - Hi , Danny . Let me get the address . You ready ? Mulder ? I 'm just writing it down . The number belongs to a company called Zeus Storage . - 1616 , Pandora Street . - Yeah . 1616 , Pandora Street . - That 's it . - Right . Thanks . OK , we 've got a white male . Weak vitals with severe dyspnoea and hypotension . He also has a green fluid coming from a wound in his right upper quadrant . I don 't know what that is . Any response to ventilation ? No . And we 're noticing a hyposonant-sounding chest . - He 's going real blue . - OK . You 've got a tension pneumothorax . Perform a thoracotomy to release the pressure in his chest . OK. I need a cannula . We 're gonna do a needle decompression . Mobile men , what 's going on ? Mobile men , can you hear me ? Mobile men , answer me ! Mobile men , what is the problem ? Mobile men , come in , please ! - Mulder . - lt 's me . - He 's alive , Scully . - Who ? The fugitive . The driver of the silver Ciera . He called the doctor 's house . - Where is he now ? - l don 't know . Where are you ? I 'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department. I 've got something for you . is it smaller than a silver Ciera ? Much . And it 's not silver , it 's green . What is it ? Some kind of bacteria . Each containing virus . And it looks as if Berube may have been cloning them . They also contain something like chloroplasts . Plant cells . But they 've never seen anything like it here . Any idea what he was doing with them ? The only reason you 'd clone a virus instead of bacteria is in order to inject it into something living . It 's called gene therapy and it 's still highly experimental . Maybe that 's what he was doing with the monkeys . Can they tell you anything else there ? Yeah . They 're just about to run some primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence . Now , I may be understating the strangeness of this , Mulder . Bacteria like this ... lt may have existed , but not for millions of years . Not since before our ancestors first crawled out of the sea . Are you there , Mulder ? - Mulder ? - Yeah . Scully , keep up the good work . - Agent Scully . - Oh , Dr Carpenter. I fell asleep . I 've done some work . These are the DNA sequences from the bacteria sample you brought in . You know a little about molecular biology . Do you know what you 're looking at ? - Yeah. I think those are genes . - Right . They 're called base pairs . Each pair is made up of something called a nucleotide . Only four nucleotides exist in DNA . Four . And through some miracle of design that we have yet to fathom , every living thing is created out of these four basic building blocks . What you 're looking at is a sequence of genes from the bacteria sample . Normally , we 'd find no gaps in the sequence . But with these bacteria we do . Why is that ? I don 't know why . But I tell you , under any other circumstances my first call would have been to the government . What exactly did you find ? A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide . A new base pair . Agent Scully , what you are looking at ... lt exists nowhere in nature . It would have to be by definition extraterrestrial . Hello ? Mulder ? Where on earth have you been ? I 've been trying to call you all night . I had a situation. I left my phone in the car . Mulder ... That bacteria l had analysed ... They 're saying that it doesn 't exist in nature . They 're saying that it could be extraterrestrial . - Scully . - What ? How soon can you be here ? There 's something I gotta show you . Wait a second . Mulder ? I just want to say that I was wrong . That 's all right . Don 't worry about it . No . If you 'd have listened to me , we wouldn 't be here right now . I should know by now to trust your instincts . Why ? Nobody else does . You know , I 've always held science as sacred . I 've always put my trust in the accepted facts . And what I saw last night ... For the first time in my life , I don 't know what to believe . Whatever it is you do believe , Scully , when you walk into that room , nothing sacred will hold . There were tanks here and five bodies suspended in solution . There were computers monitoring them . They were alive , Scully . Underwater . - What happened to them ? - God only knows . Most likely they 've been destroyed . Ms Scully , we 've met ever so briefly . - Destroyed by whom ? - l don 't know . I don 't believe you . There are limits to my knowledge , Mr Mulder . Inside the intelligence community there are so-called black organisations . Groups within groups conducting covert activities , unknown at the highest levels ... I was chased by three men last night . If you were chased , you would have been killed . Those men are trained for that and they are trained well . - Were those the men who killed Dr Berube ? - Presumably . - Why ? - Why ? ! Good Lord ! You 've worked so hard and you still don 't see it ! Dr Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial viruses . Yes ! But that 's been going on for years . We 've had the tissue since 1947 , but not the technology . Roswell ? Roswell was a smoke screen . We 've had a half a dozen better salvage operations . Dr Berube was killed because his work was too successful . You 're standing in the room where the first DNA transplant took , the first human-alien hybrid was created . Six volunteer patients , all terminally ill . One , Dr William Secare , a friend of Dr Berube 's , was dying of melanoma cancer . And as a result of the ET gene therapy all six patients treated in this room began to recover from their illnesses . Dr Secare was able to live a more or less normal life . As normal as possible for a man who has developed inhuman strength and the ability to breathe underwater . That 's how he was able to elude capture . What was he running from ? Dr Secare was never supposed to have survived ! Dr Berube 's research was part of a top-secret government project at Los Alamos . All they were interested in was the technology , the science . To have a hybrid living out in the real world ? Too great a liability . I mean , what if he should need emergency medical procedure ? The man has a blood chemistry that is alien and very likely toxic . If that story hit the press ... - lt was just easier to kill Dr Secare . - Of course . There was only one problem . Dr Berube was able to warn him . There 's just one thing I don 't understand . Why you gave us so little to go on in the beginning and why you 're giving us so much now . I didn 't anticipate the speed of their clean-up operation . They 're systematically destroying all the evidence . Dr Berube , the bodies here ... Without the evidence , you two have no case . Who would believe the story I just told you ? You must put together everything you have found and you must find Dr Secare before they do . I 'll have no further contact with you on this matter . I 'm going to Georgetown to get all the lab work . I 'm gonna find Dr Secare . Where ? I don 't know. I 'm gonna trust my instincts ! Excuse me. I 'm looking for Dr Ann Carpenter . I can 't reach her by phone and she 's not in her office . She was in a terrible car accident . Her whole family . And Dr Carpenter is ... dead . Dr Secare ? Wait ! I 'll protect you . Your cellular phone 's been ringing off the hook . I 'm a popular guy . Why don 't you answer it for me ? I don 't like talking on the phone . I have this thing about unsecured lines . When you feel like talking , let me know , though . He 's not home . Where is he ? He 's been gone all night . I wish I knew . Something 's happened to him . - They won 't kill him . - How do you know that ? He 's become too high-profile and you 've got evidence that could expose them . I don 't have any ! They took the evidence and may have killed in order to get it . Listen to me . - Evidence still exists . - Where ? It may be difficult to obtain , but with your medical background - l might be able to get you inside . - Inside where ? High containment facility , Fort Marlene , Maryland . - What do they have there ? - The wellspring , Ms Scully . The original tissue . If they 've got Agent Mulder , they might be willing to make a deal . It could save his life . Clear . Name ? Dana Scully . - Company or institution ? - Federal government . Project password ? Project password ? Purity control . Log in , please . You 're late . - Do you have it ? - Yes . Good . They 're willing to make the exchange . - You spoke to them ? - Yes . - l 'll take the parcel . - No , sir . I 'll make the exchange . I made the deal , Scully . They 're expecting me . - l don 't trust you . - You 've got no one else to trust ! I don 't know who you are . I know nothing about you . Oh , for God 's sake ! Don 't screw this up ! Let me tell you something . In 1987 a group of children were given what they thought was a routine inoculation . What they were injected with was a clone DNA from the contents of that package you 're holding , as a test . That 's the people you 're dealing with ! - So why give it back to them ? - To save Mulder 's life ! - At the risk of so many other lives ? - lt 's the tip of the iceberg . You and Mulder must bring it to light . Now give me the parcel . Give me the parcel , Scully ! No ! Mulder ! Mulder ! Trust ... Trust ... no one . Hello ? Hey , Scully , it 's me . Where are you ? They 're shutting us down , Scully . What ? They called me in tonight . They said they 're gonna reassign us to other sections . Who told you that ? Skinner . He said word came down from the top of the Executive Branch . Mulder ... - lt 's over , Scully . - You have to lodge a protest . - They can 't ... - Yes , they can . What are you gonna do ? I 'm ... not gonna give up. I can 't give up . Not as long as the truth is out there . Visiontext subtitles by Sarah Emery I made this ! english

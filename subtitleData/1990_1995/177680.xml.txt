 [ siren wails ] Hey , Skrull-bot ! Don 't forget your lovely parting ' gifts ! Hold off on those reinforcements . The Fantastic Four are here . So , the little firefly wants to play at war . Order the K50 robot to annihilate that flaming nuisance . [ Reed ] The Skrull robot 's third eye is not firing . Obviously a targeting device . Ben ! Hey ! Say no more . One super-size Skrull shiner comin ' up ! [ Johnny ] Attaboy , Benjy . The black eye from Ol ' Blue Eyes . Flame on ! Quite a wallop you 're packing , Suzy Q. Thanks . I learned from the best . Ben ! Play , er , spheroid ? Aw ! You mean play ball , you nutty professor ! Our sneak attack has failed . - Abort and return to the Skrull galaxy . - Yes , sir . Oh . But my day will come , Fantastic Four . Even now the circle of fate continues to tighten around you . Nice work , old friend . Any red-blooded thing would have done the same . Huh ? It 's Sis . She 's not moving . Our top story . Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four sustained serious head injuries routing the Skrulls . Doctors list her in a critical condition . Other news ... Come on , Sis . You 've got to pull through . You just gotta . We need you . Susan . Hey , keep your little rubber chin up , Stretcho . She 's gonna make it . Susie 's a fighter . [ man ] Mr. Richards ... - Doctor ! Will she ... Is she ... - It 's not good . Mrs. Richards has a piece of shrapnel embedded in her brain . - Suse ... - But surely you can operate . No . It requires surgery beyond my capability or that of anyone else on our staff . There 's only one surgeon I know of who has performed such an operation successfully . Who ? Where is he ? Let 's get him ! I wish it were so easy , young man . The doctor disappeared many years ago . He 's not likely to show up now . Don 't be too sure of that , doctor . [ Reed ] Doctor Storm ! - Dad ? - Hello , Son . Wait a minute . How in the ... Dad ! But I don 't get it . Sis said you were dead . There 's no time to lose . We 'll prep your daughter for surgery . This way . I must be thinkin of some other superheroes . I always thought the kid and Susie was orphans . That 's what she wanted everyone to think . Even Johnny . How long 's it gonna take ? They 've been in there hours . Hang in there . [ Ben ] It 's over . Susan , darling ! She looks so pale . She 's going to be fine . I expect a full recovery . Yahoo ! Susie-girl 's gonna be okay ! Thank heavens . I 've got my Susan back . I have never been so happy to meet someone ... Doctor Franklin Storm ? Ah , Detective . I 've been expecting you . You have the right to remain silent ... Be serious ! - [ Johnny ] What 's going on ? - [ Reed ] What 's this about ? We 've had a warrant out for his arrest for years . We had a feeling this might flush him out . On what charge ? What 's he done ? Franklin Storm is wanted ... - for murder ! - [ all ] What ? ! [ Ben ] I tell ya , Susie . We 've been bluer than Smurf berries all week without ya . 'Cept for me there ain 't a single pretty face round here ! You all look terrific , too . It 's so good to be home . Darling , I know I get a little too obsessed with my work . But I thought I might ... lose you . There 's so much I still don 't know about you . So much you 've been keeping locked up inside . - It 's okay . - [ Johnny ] Yeah . Yeah ! Like our father being alive and wanted for murder . You never bothered to tell me ! - Johnny ... - It 's all right . Johnny , I 'm sorry . But you were so young . I was trying to protect you . Maybe it 's time you let your baby brother grow up . [ sighs ] You 're right . Reed , hand me the photo album . In the drawer next to you . [ Susan ] Remember this ? [ Ben ] Look ! There 's Torchy when he was just a little matchstick . This was taken before they left for the Medical Society dinner . It was honoring Dad 's work . That was the night Mother died . It wasn 't his fault , but Dad was never the same . He was lost without Mother . He started gambling . And losing . He borrowed money from the wrong people . They came to collect . He couldn 't pay . They threatened to hurt his children . Us ! There was a fight . The gun went off . It was an accident . Dad didn 't think anyone would believe him . He started running and he never stopped . He called once to tell me he was okay . He felt it would be easier if you thought he was dead . I ... I didn 't know . [ fierce bubbling ] - No ! It 's impossible ! - Prepare for a journey . A journey from which there is no return . While I prepare for my missión ... the beginning of the end for the Fantastic Four ! - I hope he 's all right . - Yeah . Dad ! [ Susan ] Good to see you ! Reed spoke to our attorney , Matt Murdoch . - He 's taking on your case ! - That won 't be necessary . What do you mean ? - Are you all right ? - More than all right . During my years in hiding I 've developed a formula that alters the cells of my DNA . - To make myself invincible ! - Siddown , Storm ! You know the rules ! Your insipid rules have just been changed ! Dad ! Hold it , Storm ! There is no Doctor Storm . Make way for the Invincible Man ! There ! The new power ray is installed . A completely clean energy source for the Fantasticar . I got the idea from that Skrull robot . The ray draws energy from beyond the solar system and ... [ Ben ] Hey , Stretch ! The emergency signal ! Behold the might of the Invincible Man ! Dad , stop ! What are you doing ? [ Invincible Man ] So , you 're all here . It 's time for a long-overdue father-son talk . - Dad , this is insane ! - You dare speak that way to me ? Doctor Storm , please , listen to reason ! Sue , what do I do ? I can 't attack my own father . Susie , stop your old man before we have to hurt him . Everyone , stand back ! No ! Why , thank you , daughter , dear . Your assistance has been invaluable ! [ cackles ] Did you see ? The Invisible Woman helped that madman get away . [ man ] What did you expect ? He 's family . I 'm sorry , but I couldn 't let you hurt my father . [ Invincible Man ] What 's the matter ? My dear , loving children . Need a lift ? Now , let 's make it nice and toasty cozy . - This firetrap is shrinking ' ! - [ Reed ] Johnny ! Try and absorb the flame ! [ strains ] It 's no good ! He regenerates the fire as fast as I can absorb it ! [ Susan ] Fire , force fields ... It 's like he has all our powers . He does . Of course ! That 's it ! [ Susan ] Dad ! [ Johnny ] Dad ! - What have you done to Father ? - That is not your father . What are you talking about ? Return the real Doctor Storm at once , or this imposter will be destroyed . Ben , grab him ! Okay . No , don 't believe him ! He 's lying ! Am I ? - [ pulsing ] - [ onlookers gasp ] - [ all , gasping ] Super Skrull ! - Of course , Earthlings ! Did you think the Skrull empire would let me stay forever in that little volcanic prison you arranged ? Remember , Super Skrull 's power is beamed in from his galaxy . So I simply jammed the frequency with my power ray . It was a Skrull plan to divide and discredit the Fantastic Four . Pretty smooth sleuthing , Sherlock ! Once again the Fantastic Four has beaten you , Morrat . Now will you give up your obsessión with the Earth ? No , my loving princess . If we expect your father to consent to our marriage , I need to prove myself worthy . I 'm not beaten . Why doesn 't something happen ? Maybe they never even ... [ Ben ] Woah ! Hey . Must be trash pick-up day . Dad ! No ! Stay away ! Don 't come any closer ! - [ all ] No ! - [ Ben ] Doc ! [ Reed ] They booby-trapped him ! No ! He isn 't ... He isn 't ... - Oh ! - I 'll call an ambulance . It will be too late , Ben . Oh , Dad ! That explosión was meant for us and he knew it . He willingly gave his life to save ours . Your father is a very brave man . Don 't ... Don 't cry , Susan . Or you , Johnny . Don 't feel sorry for me . I let life defeat me years ago . Didn 't have the courage to face it . I 've found that courage now . And more important , I 've found you . Morrat , how could you do something so cruel ? Anelle ... Warlord Morrat . Our science officer has some data you may find interesting . Yes . Oh , yes ! Very ! It isn 't fair . We found our father again just to lose him . Those stinkin ' Skrulls are gonna pay for this . Even if I have to burn down their whole blasted galaxy ! I understand how you feel . But there 's a difference between justice and vengeance . I don 't care ! I 'm gonna find the Skrull who did this ... - You bet , kid ! - [ Reed ] Johnny ! Even if we 've gotta fight us a whole planet of green guys with bad complexions ! [ all ] What ? ! Wha ... Hey , man .. I didn 't mean right this minute . Quickly ! A force-field barrier ! Fire ! [ Sue ] My force field just dissolved ! Flame on ! My flame ! Time for a Skrull roundup ! - I can 't stretch ! - This toothpick put on weight ! Now , contain them with the immobilizer ray ! - [ crunch ] - Ow ! Wah ! Did you hear that ? Nothing but a puny whap ! Face facts , Ben . Something in the Skrull atmosphere has neutralized our powers . I don 't understand . If the Skrulls could just beam us here , why didn 't they do it long ago ? Because the beam needs either Super Skrull or another strong signal source to guide it in . And unfortunately my power ray gave them just that signal . Then that 's it ! We 're Skrull kibble ! Not necessarily . I have an idea . [ Anelle ] You must tell my father the wondrous news of your triumph . - Then he will consent . - Of course , my beloved . I have no secrets from our noble emperor . - Now go . I have much to do . - All right . Lieutenant , execute the prisoners at once . - But ... - At once ! When people learn that they died at the hands of Morrat I will be the Skrull Galaxy 's greatest hero ! Then it will be my sad duty to succeed our beloved emperor . [ Morrat ] After his untimely demise . - [ Morrat ] At my command , fire . - Wait ! Don 't shoot ! I have something to trade in return for our lives . Hm . Speak . And speak fast ! You know how my scientific skill has defeated you in the past . - But now I offer the universe ! - [ all ] What ? ! [ laughs ] I do not trust you , Earthling . [ Reed ] What have you to lose by hearing me out ? What ? The Fantastic Four ? Here ? Captured ? Why was I not told ? But Morrat promised to inform you immediately , Father . Morrat ! That untrustworthy martinet ! He has told me nothing . By my scepter , this smacks of the highest treason . Come ! This ray enables a leader like yourself to achieve his rightful place as ruler of the Skrull Galaxy . - I 'll show you . - Take care , or your wife dies . How can you do this ? You know he 'll use it to attack Earth . Shut up , Johnny . Don 't tell me what to do . You 're sellin ' out our planet and we 're supposed to " shut up " ? - Why , ya yellow-bellied ... - Shut up , both of you ! I 'm the one who makes the decisions ! Reed , no ! - That goes for you , too , Susan ! - Well , aren 't we ruthless ! How very ... Skrull . I believe I know how to use this now . Like this ! - Why don 't you fall ? - The ray is a power source , Morrat . Not a weapon . And it 's what we needed to restore our powers ! Flame on ! How was my acting there , Ben , buddy ? De Niro ain 't gonna lose any sleep . Destroy them ! Call for reinforcements ! Now ! [ Ben ] Looks like we 're gonna have to whup us a whole planet ! [ Johnny ] Just one planet ? Be done by lunch ! Morrat , I command you to stop . Your Highness . An unexpected honor ! Allow me to present Your Majesty with these alien prisoners as a paltry token of my esteem . Liar ! Traitor ! Don 't toy with me ! I know your intentions . - Father , Morrat 's your warlord ! - Silence ! He is Warlord no longer ! Strip him of his insignia ! Put him in chains . I brand Morrat a traitor to the realm . Very well . Have it your way . If traitor I am branded , then traitor I shall be ! - Death to the Emperor ! - [ Anelle ] No ! [ Dorrek ] Cease fire ! Morrat ! Morrat , no ! She lives ! - It 's a miracle . - [ Reed ] Not quite . You have Susan to thank . Anelle was saved by her force field . What ? My daughter 's life ... saved by an Earthling ? An enemy ! The sight of you is repugnant to me , but I am in your debt . We ask only for the Skrull who killed Franklin Storm . As you wish . There is the one you seek . The traitor , Morrat ! [ tearfully ] Now depart before I change my mind . Our transporter will return you to your planet . I guess we got what we wanted , huh , Sis ? Funny . I thought it would feel better . But revenge only keeps the hurt alive .

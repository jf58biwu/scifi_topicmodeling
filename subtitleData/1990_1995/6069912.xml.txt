 [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ thud ] [ clicking ] Come on . My God , Lex , make it stop ! You can 't go through with this . ( Lex ) 'Oh , yes , I can . ' Just think , my darling .. ... we 'll have what we always dreamed of together . What he would never let us have . A little peace . A little happiness . What 're you doing ? Are you out of your mind ? She is just a dummy ! You are the dummy , you arrogant twit . She 's more alive than you 've ever been . [ choking ] You don 't love me . Uh ... you never did . How perceptive . [ gasps ] Warning , 30 seconds to complete psycho-meld . 29 , 28 .. ' ... 27 , 26 .. ' ' ... 25 , 24 .. ' [ laughing ] Better say your prayers , folks 'cause it 's all over now . I flip this little switch ... and in three minutes .. ... I 'm in line for a whole lot of insurance money . [ panting ] [ eerie music ] You can 't do this . It goes against everything you are . - You don 't know what I am . - I know your heart . I don 't care what these people did to you . But you can 't kill them like he did . - You 're not Lex . - Yes , I am ! No , you 're not . [ slow-paced music ] This isn 't real . None of this is real . You 're real . [ instrumental music ] [ laughing maniacally ] [ beeping ] ( man in hologram ) 'Memory loop broken . Memory loop broken . Psycho-meld averted . No-o-o ! [ thud ] [ crackling ] Lana , it 's really you . [ panting ] The life he had all they put him through , no wonder he turned out that way . You lived it too and you didn 't become a killer . It 's not the same . Before I ever went in there I had a good life . And even when I was in there I had you . Who did he have ? Lena . We 've gotta find her . She 's the only person in the world Luthor ever loved . You think she 's in there ? Well , he 's hooked up to every information system in the world . Must have kept track of her . There 's gotta be something . Bingo . Oh , no . [ slow-paced music ] ( Lex ) 'You see , my darling , that you had died in that horrible crash my world ended . So now , I 'm taking out the rest of the world with me . And then ... the two of you .. ... can have it all to yourselves . Forever and ever . ( Darla ) 'Stop it , Lex . ' [ dramatic music ] [ chuckling ] Oh , come on , please , Darla , you 're not gonna shoot me . 'You worship me , remember ? ' Come on , nitwit , give me the gun . Stop the countdown , Lex , or I 'll shoot . I 'm shakin ' in my boots . I gave you everything I 've got , Lex . [ intense music ] I 've done things for you that I never thought I could do . But I 'm not gonna stand by and let you wipe everything out . You mean , uh .. ... somewhere in that dim consciousness there lurks a noble soul ? You 're like a dog , Darla . A street mongrel . 'You just take it and take it and take it . ' I loved you . [ gunshot ] [ dramatic music ] [ beeping ] Fascinating . I didn 't think you had it in you . Obviously , you .. Stop the countdown , Lex . No , can 't do . Once it 's started , no way to stop it . Might as well finish me off right now , Darla . We 're all gonna be nuclear dust ... soon enough . ( automated message ) 'Detonation in 55 minutes . ' [ intense music ] [ chuckling ] Oh , ooh .. Something 's not right . What do you mean ? Lena 's car went off the bridge , but they never found the body . So , the body was washed away . Maybe . Why would she fake her own death ? Think about it . If you were Lex 's sister , wouldn 't you wanna put as many miles between the two of you as possible ? Hold it . Look at this . She had all of her utilities turned off the day before she died . Coincidence ? Probably is . Or maybe this was left on the computer to trick us . It 's just another one of Luthor 's traps . It 's hopeless . Lana ... you can never give up hope . [ instrumental music ] [ music continues ] [ beeping ] [ clicks ] - Ah ! Ah .. - Superboy . [ buzzing ] [ panting ] Keep looking for Lena . I 've gotta go . What is it ? What 's wrong ? [ theme music ] [ buzzing ] [ buzzing stops ] Alright , Luthor , you 've got my attention . What do you want ? [ footsteps ] [ intense music ] Darla , what 's this ? Another trick to get me out of the way ? No . I got out of there so I could signal you without him knowing . You gotta stop him . Tell Luthor it 's not gonna work . Wait , no , don 't go , please . He doesn 't know that I 'm here , I swear . You gotta stop him , please . Where can I find him ? I 'll take you to him . I 'm Bob Sokoler , here is what 's happening . Less than an hour left until Luthor 's deadline runs out and there 's been no word yet from Superboy . The evacuation of Capitol City is continuing or should I say , attempted evacuation . Many people have refused to leave . And rioting and looting is widespread . [ knocking on door ] That 's the latest we have at this hour .. [ knocking continues ] [ clicks ] My name is Lana Lang . I 'm with the Bureau for Extranormal Matters . ( female # 1 ) 'Yes ? ' I need your help .. ... that is , if you are who I think you are . [ thud ] [ pounding on door ] ( Lana ) 'We really don 't 'The whole world is depending on you , Lena . ' [ instrumental music ] [ knocking on door ] Hark , visitors at this hour ? Entrer , my homicidal sweetheart . [ thud ] [ dramatic music ] Darla , you are full of surprises today . 'And who says they can 't teach an old dog new tricks ? ' [ laughing ] Okay , Luthor , party 's over . Disarm the warhead ! And you , you actually escaped from the memory loop . That 's very impressive . You know , you 're the only opponent I 've ever faced who 's near worthy of me . You 're not , not quite , but close . So I think it 's only appropriate that we be together when the world goes , poof ! [ intense music ] [ groans ] Disarm the warhead . The countdown can 't be stopped even if I want it to . Which I don 't . Luthor .. [ intense music ] [ laughing ] [ eerie music ] - Luthor ? - Just call me Lex . Turning off the utilities a day before you died is one thing . But leaving your return address on the work order .. My God , if I could find you that easily don 't you think Lex could ? It would never occur to him , not even for a second that I would do something like that . So he 'd never bother to look for clues . Why would his adoring little sister stage her own death ? [ instrumental music ] Do you know what it 's like to be haunted by a ghost that follows you everywhere ? Last name 's Luthor ? Any relation to that maniac ? They always find out . And then it 's time to move again . Find new friends , make a new life . But it never works . [ music continues ] People look at me like I 'm a freak . The police are always watching in case he shows his face . And he keeps writing to me . Letters full of fantasy . About how the day will come when we can be together again . Happy and free . [ music continues ] That 's why I thought if I could just kill Lena once and for all- - But when you killed Lena , you killed Lex too . That 's what 's driven him to this . Pushed him over the edge . Oh , I pushed him over the edge ? No . No one is going to blame me for this . He killed our parents , he .. [ breathes heavily ] Oh , what 's the point ? Pretty soon it will all be over with . And the Luthor legacy goes on to the end of the world . But it doesn 't have to be that way . If we could find out where Lex is , I could bring you to him- - No ! No , I won 't go . He 's worse than my father was . He 's a monster . Well , that monster did everything in his power to protect you . He did protect you ! And he paid the price . [ instrumental music ] [ shattering ] [ thwacking ] You think this will change anything ? It won 't make the memories go away . It won 't end your pain . I was in the machine , I lived it too . [ instrumental music ] Don 't listen to that pseudo-psycho garbage . Kill him . What 's the point ? He 'll be dead soon enough . Excuse me , now just who invented whom here ? ( automated message ) 'Three minutes to detonation . ' Uh-uh-uh , smash that and the bomb will go off now . Don 't just stand there doing nothing , stop him ! There 's nothing he can do except try to find that bomb . Try to beat the clock . [ imitates clock ticking ] Oh , it 's hopeless . ( Lana ) Don 't ever give up hope . [ laughing ] We 'll bust out the party hats . So glad you could make it , darling . We 're planning to have a real blast . How the hell did you find me ? - It was in your letters . - Letters ? What letters ? ( Lena ) The ones you wrote me . The place you begged me to come to . Your haven . Your bunker . Lead-shielded underground where not even Superboy could find you . ( both ) Lena . No-no , no , no , I 'm Lex . He 's just a machine . But how can it be ? What is that ? Oh , that 's ... you . ( automated message ) 'One minute to detonation . ' But ... how ? Stop the countdown . But you 're alive . Stop the countdown , Lex . Lena ... tell me what happened . Who did this ? Who wanted me to believe that you were dead ? I did . I hate you , Lex . - What ? - Don 't you understand ? I hate you . You 're a disease . You 're a cancer . You 're like a cancer in my life . Everything you touch , you kill . - No . - Everything you love .. The only thing you love is yourself and death . - I hate you , I hate you .. - Y-you made her say this ! Make her stop ! - ' I hate you ! ' - Make her stop . ( automated message ) 'Thirty seconds to detonation . ' No , nobody controls me . Not father , not you , no one . 'I wanted my own life free all of you . ' No one talks to Lex Luthor like that . No one . You 're not Lex . You 're as much a machine as that thing is . ( automated message ) '13 , 12 , 11 , 10 .. ' Well , then you can just die , along with everyone else . No . Code genesis LX666 abort . ( automated message ) 'Countdown aborted . Lena . Please , don 't leave me . I love you , I would never hurt you . I can be good . I promise . Please , we 'll be happy . Code LX0 terminate ! We .. You said you couldn 't stop the countdown . I lied . Leave . [ chuckles ] The party is over , folks , could you just get out ! You were always such a brainless little twit just like all the rest . I never loved you . [ instrumental music ] I never loved you . [ music continues ] - Let 's get that arm looked at . - I never loved her . [ music continues ] Sure , Lex , whatever you say . [ music continues ] [ theme music ] [ music continues ]

 Woman On Radio : Rogeryour request for assistance . What is your present location ? Unit 50 , go ahead . Suspect is now westbound . Has entered the gate ofthe shipworks . Unit 50 still in pursuit . Over . Officer On Bullhorn : Pull yourvehicle over and stop ! Putyour hands on the roofand freeze ! Hold it ! ( Men Grunting ) Get on the ground ! Do it ! Did you hear me ? Face down ! Do it ! ( Grunting ) ( Grunting ) Stop ! Armed officer ! ( Gunshots ) I hit him . I know I hit him . Where the hell did he go ? He 'd be bleeding bad . ... offthe coast ofltaly . But theirs is a very light lava . That 's what stumped me . Because inside there must be something the weight ofthe heaviest rock . But , Professor , that would be Icelandic peridotite . Precisely . There 's a piece chipped off . By me . Well , what 's the rock inside ? Icelandic peridotite , naturally . When I saw this , I stopped chipping . ( Phone Rings ) Mulder . Areyou watching channel eight ? What 's your conclusion ? Science does not jump to conclusions . Science is not a guessing game . Reporter : ... where a 60-mile high-speed car chase ended early this evening- - the suspect eluding capture by leaping into the harbor but not before injuring several Ardis police officers . We have Captain Roy Lacerio standing by . How was the man able to escape and how seriously injured were the officers involved ? Those details are still unclear . I 'll be talking with several ... I 'm sorry- - You 'll have to excuse me . Captain Roy Lacerio being pulled away here during an intense manhunt . ... Lacerio being pulled away here during an intense ... Mulder , you 've been through this tape 1 00 times . What exactly areyou hoping to find ? Mulder : I don 't know . And all he told you was to watch channel eight ? Yeah , that 's all he said . Do we even know why the suspect was being chased ? As far as I can tell he wouldn 't pull over for a moving violation . Well , that should put him on the ten most wanted list . There must be something here . Some detail we 're not seeing . How doyou know he 's notjustyanking your chain ? Well , he has admitted lying toyou . He wouldn 't call ifthere wasn 't something here- - something he wants me to see . Then what areyou missing ? There were three law enforcement agencies out here last night . Hunting a man on a moving violation ? I know it 's not Silence ofthe Lambs but it 's what we do . This man isn 't wearing a badge or a uniform . He 's not one ofyours ? No , sir . But it was a zoo out here . You say the suspect was shot . Why hasn 't the body been recovered ? We got our search ongoing . We 're quite certain he will be found . It 's been almost 1 8 hours , Captain . Where could the body be ? There are cables and debris all over the bottom . It 's a painstaking business . Can I askwhat the F.B.I. ' s interest in this case would be ? The suspect matches the description ofa federal fugitive . Really ? How 's that ? No description ofthe suspect has been released . Ifyou don 't mind , can we take a look at the car , please ? It 's been taken to impound . The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency in Gaithersburg . They had no idea the carwas even missing . You know , Mulder I think that we 're wasting our time here . I don 't know what the hell I 'm supposed to find . You can 't make out the license plate in this photo . Scully , look at this . What ? Look at the car in the photo . Look at the windshield . It 's not the same car . Scully : It 's called a caduceus . It 's the adopted symbol ofthe medical profession . So probably only a doctor would have that on his car . Mm-hmm . I had the picture enhanced . The plate is different . " 3 A-Y-F . " Fast-forward . That 's all you can make out . The rest is obscured . Hey , Danny , it 's Mulder . Run a Maryland plate for me . All I got is a partial . Registered to a doctor , or used to be . Yeah , I 'll hold . They switched cars and lied about it . Whywould they do that ? Maybe the real owner ofthe car has something to hide . ( Animal Squeals ) Mulder : Dr. Berube ? Yes ? We 're with the F.B.I. Can we have a minute ? I 'm very busy . Areyou aware that a car registered toyou was involved in a high-speed chase in Ardis yesterday ? Excuse me ? A silver Ciera , Doctor . Doyou own one ? Yes . It was used forwhat ? A crime . Wereyou aware it was even missing ? Not until now . I have a housekeeper , and she often uses the car . It 's a second car ... Please ! They should not be excited . Nothing should be touched . I thought theywere friendly . They 're part ofan experiment . What kind ? Am I under some kind ofsuspicion ? No . Then I think I 've answered all your questions . Excuse me . I have more work than time . Thankyou . Did he biteyou ? No , but he tried to . Well , it 's almost 5 : 00 . Let 's check with the doctor 's housekeeper about the car . No . No ? What doyou mean ? This has reached the point ofabsurdity . We 're out here on halfa hunch offa cryptic phone call chasing down a clue that 's based on speculation . Well , that 's all we 've got . That 's all he 's given us . Who is this Deep Throat character ? We don 't know anything about him . He 's in a delicate position . He has access to information and indiscretion could expose him . You don 't know that this isn 'tjust a game . He 's toying with you . Rationing out the facts . You think he does it because he gets offon it ? No . I think he does it becauseyou do . Calling it a night Mr. Mulder ? My mother usually likes me home before the street lights come on . I 'm surprised atyou . Why ? Your level ofcommitment seems to have diminished . My level ofcommitment ? I expected thatyou 'd be working through the night putting the pieces together . Maybe ifyou 'd given me something more to workwith . I 've given you all I can . A news report ? And where has it led you ? Not very far . It may be further than you realize . This has always been on your terms . I 've been the dutiful son . This time we canjust cut out the Obi Wan Kenobi crap and save me the trouble . I fearyou 've become too dependent on me . Look , I 've got plenty to do without chasing down yourvague leads or trying to decode your circular logic . Maybe it 's you who 's become too dependent on me- - on mywillingness to playyour games . Mr. Mulder ? What ? Don 't give up on this one . Trust me . You 've never been closer . Closer to what ? ( Door Opening ) Hello ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Working late tonight , Doctor ? What doyou want here ? He 's alive , isn 't he ? Has he contacted you ? Please . You 're going to have to leave . ( Banging Cage Violently ) Ifyou 're from the F.B.I. I 've already answered all your questions . What questions ? I had nothing to say to them . I have nothing to say toyou . Where 's Doctor Secare ? I don 't know whatyou 're talking about . Please . Mywork is very important . I must get on with mywork . I 'm afraid ... yourwork is done . ( Loud Shattering , Equipment Falling ) Anybody see anything ? No . Nothing . I 'm calling it off . Let 's get those guys out ofthe water . Yes , sir . Bring it in . Scully : The county sheriffs office is conducting the investigation . On the preliminary reports it 's being listed as a suicide . Suicide ? They think that , forwhatever reason he trashed his lab and then killed himself . How ? He tied one end ofa roll ofmedical gauze around his neck and the other end to this gas outlet . Then hejumped . Were there anywitnesses ? Nope . He kept this place like he was waiting for the people from Good Housekeeping to show up . I would never have pegged him to do this ... or a Greg Louganis out the window . Scully : I know . That gauze is troubling . It 's a bit too calculated , huh ? As ifsomeone wanted to make doubly sure he 'd break his neck before he hit the ground . What else do we know about Dr. Berube ? Um ... " Terrence Allen Berube . Harvard Med , 1 974 . " He was working on the Human Genome Project . Areyou familiar with that ? Yeah . The mapping ofall human genes . Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor in the history ofmankind . There 's nothing extraordinary about that . There were thousands ofscientists working on that project . But only one who owned a silver Ciera and went bungeejumping with medical gauze wrapped around his neck . I 'm seeing the pieces but I 'm not seeing the connection . Mulder : Maybe that 'sjust it . Maybe we 're not seeing it because it can 't be seen , not in any obvious way . What is this ? I don 't know . Can you find out ? What will you do ? I 'll see what else I can find out about Dr. Berube . Okay , Mulder , but I 'm warning you . Ifthis is monkey pee , you 're on your own . ( Doorbell Rings ) My first impression is it 's some kind ofbacteria specimen . Can I askyou whereyou got it ? It was recovered at a crime scene . We 've come a long way from Colonel Mustard in the den with a rope , haven 't we ? I 'm expecting it will turn out to be nothing . No . You 've definitely got something here . Wow . Look at this . Scully : What are they ? They 're the size ofbacteria but no bacteria I 've ever seen . How doyou mean ? Well , most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth . These are ... I don 't know . It 's strange . You have no way ofidentifying them ? Well , we could do a freeze fracture . Take a thin slice off and see what 's going on inside these babies ... ifyou don 't mind waiting . No . No , I 'll wait . Hi , Danny . Yeah , it 's Mulder again . Look , I 've got a number this time- - 555-2804 , area code 301 . I need an address , a name ifyou can get it for me . All right . I 'm at , uh ... same prefix , 1 51 7 . All right . Thanks , Danny . ( Ringing ) Mulder : That was fast . Man 's Voice : Terry , is thatyou ? Yeah . Who 's this ? They shot me , Terry . Oh , God . I 've been in the water for three days . I 'm hurt . Where areyou now ? At a pay phone . I 'll pickyou up . Where areyou ? Terry ... You okay ? Areyou there ? Hello ? Hello . This man 's been hurt here . I think he needs medical attention . What 's the street ? What 's the street ? I 'm going to call an ambulance . Sir ? ( Telephone Ringing ) Don 't hang up . You got it . Hi , Danny . I got it . Let me get the address . All right , you ready ? Mulder ? I 'm just writing it down now . Go ahead . Belongs to a company called Zeus Storage . 1 61 6 Pandora . Zeus Storage . Yeah . 1 61 6 Pandora Street . That 's it . All right , thanks . ( Siren Wailing ) Medic : White male , 40 , weakvitals severe dyspnea and hypotension . He also has a green fuid coming from a wound right upper quadrant . Doctor : ls he responding to CPR ? No , and we 're noticing rope veins at the neck and a hypersonant sounding chest . He 's going real blue on us now . Release the air pressing on the heart cavity . I 'm going to need a cannula . We 're going to do a needle decompression . ( Air Rushes Out ) Ah ... ( Coughing ) Doctor : What 's going on in there ? ( Coughing ) Answer me . What is the problem ? Come in , please ! ( Telephone Ringing ) Mulder . It 's me . He 's alive , Scully . Who ? The driver ofthe silver Ciera . He called the doctor 's house . Where is he now ? I don 't know . Where areyou ? I 'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department . I 've got something foryou . Is it smaller than a silver Ciera ? Much . And it 's not silver . It 's green . What is it ? Some kind ofbacteria , each containing virus . Berube may have been cloning them . They also contain something that looks like chloroplasts- - plant cells . They 've never seen anything like it . What could he have been doing with them ? The only reason you clone a virus inside a bacteria is to inject it into something living . It 's called gene therapy and it 's still highly experimental . Maybe that 's what he was doing with those monkeys . Can they tell you anything else ? They 'rejust about to run some primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence . Now , I may be understating the strangeness ofthis , Mulder . Bacteria like this- - it may have existed , but not for millions ofyears ... not since before our ancestors first crawled out ofthe sea . Areyou there , Mulder ? Yeah . Scully , keep up the good work . Agent Scully . Oh , Dr. Carpenter , I fell asleep . I 've done some work . These are the DNA sequences from the bacteria sample you brought in . You know something about molecular biology . What areyou looking at ? I think those are genes . Right . They 're called base pairs . Each pair is made up ofsomething called a nucleotide . Only four nucleotides exist in DNA , four . And through some miracle ofdesign that we haveyet to fathom every living thing is created out ofthese four basic building blocks . Whatyou 're looking at is a sequence ofgenes from the bacteria sample . Normally , we 'd find no gaps in the sequence . But with these bacteria , we do . Why is that ? I don 't know why . But I tell you , under any other circumstances my first call would have been to the government . What exactly did you find ? A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide- - a new base pair . Agent Scully whatyou are looking at it exists nowhere in nature . It would have to be by definition ... extraterrestrial . ( Ringing ) Hello . Mulder ? Where on God 's Earth haveyou been ? I 've been trying to call you all night . I had a situation . I left my phone in the car . Mulder ... that bacteria I had analyzed- - They 're saying that it doesn 't exist in nature . They 're saying that it could be extraterrestrial . Scully ... What ? How soon can you be here ? There 's something I gotta showyou . Wait a second . Mulder ... I just want to say that I was wrong . That 's all right . Don 't worry about it . No , um ... ifyou 'd have listened to me , we wouldn 't be here right now . I should know by now to trustyour instincts . Why ? Nobody else does . You know , I 've always held science as sacred . I 've always put my trust in the accepted facts . And what I saw last night ... for the first time in my life , I don 't know what to believe . Whatever it is you do believe , Scully when you walk into that room ... nothing sacred will hold . There were tanks here ... and five bodies suspended in solution . There were computers monitoring them . Theywere alive , Scully , underwater . What happened to them ? God only knows . Most likely they 've been destroyed . Miss Scully . We met ever so briefy . Destroyed bywhom ? I don 't know . I don 't believeyou . There are limits to my knowledge Mr. Mulder . Inside the intelligence community there are so-called black organizations- - groups within groups conducting covert activities unknown at the highest levels ofpower . There were three men- - I was chased . Ifyou were chased , you would have been killed . Those men are trained well for that sort ofbusiness . Were those the same men who killed Dr. Berube ? Presumably . Why ? Why ? Good Lord . You 've worked so hard and you still don 't see it . Dr. Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial viruses . Yes , but that 's been going on foryears . We 've had the tissue since 1 947 but not the technology . Roswell ? Roswell was a smoke screen . We 've had a halfa dozen better salvage operations . Dr. Berube was killed because his work was too successful . You 're standing in the room where the first DNA transplant took the first human-alien hybrid was created . Six volunteer patients all terminally ill . One , Dr. William Secare , an old friend of Dr. Berube 's was dying ofmelanoma cancer . And as a result ofthe E.T. gene therapy all six patients treated in this room began to recover from their illnesses . Dr. Secare was able to live a more or less normal life- - as normal as possible for a man who has developed inhuman strength and the ability to breathe underwater . That 's how he eluded capture . What was he running from ? Dr. Secare was never supposed to have survived . Dr. Berube 's research was part ofa top secret government project . All theywere interested in was the technology . To have a hybrid living out in the real world- - too great a liability . What ifhe should need emergency medical procedure ? The man has a blood chemistry that is alien and very likely toxic . That story should hit the press . It was easier to kill Dr. Secare . Ofcourse . There was only one problem . Dr. Berube was able to warn him . There 'sjust one thing I don 't understand- - whyyou gave us so little to go on in the beginning . And why areyou giving us so much now ? I didn 't anticipate the speed and precision oftheir cleanup operation . They 're systematically destroying all the evidence- - Dr. Berube , the bodies here . Without the evidence you two have no case . Who would believe the story I just told you ? You must put together everything thatyou have found and you must find Dr. Secare before they do . I 'll have no further contact with you on this matter . I 'm going to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work . I 'm going to find Dr. Secare . Where ? I don 't know . I 'm going to trust my instincts . I 'm looking for Dr. Ann Carpenter . I 've been unable to reach her by phone and she 's not in her office . She was in a terrible car accident ... herwhole family . And Dr. Carpenter is , um , dead . ( Thump ) ( Thump ) Dr. Secare ? Wait ! I 'll protectyou . ( Gunshot ) ( Air Rushes Out ) Ah ... ! ( Coughing ) ( Ringing ) Your cellular phone 's been ringing offthe hook . I 'm a popular guy . Why don 'tyou answer it for me ? Oh , I don 't like talking on the phone . I have this thing about unsecured lines . When you feel like talking let me know , though . He 's not home . Where is he ? He 's been gone all night . I wish I knew . Something 's happened to him . Theywon 't kill him . How doyou know that ? He 's become too high-profile and you 've got evidence that could expose them . They took the evidence and they may have killed in order to get it . The evidence still exists . Where ? It might be difficult to obtain but with your medical background I might be able to getyou inside . Inside where ? The high-containment facility at Fort Marlene , Maryland . What do they have there ? The wellspring , Miss Scully- - the original tissue . Ifthey 've got Agent Mulder they might be willing to make a deal . It could save his life . ( Click ) Name ? Dana Scully . Company or institution ? Federal Government . Project password ? Project password ? Purity Control . Log in , please . You 're late . Doyou have it ? Yes . Good . They 're willing to make the exchange . You spoke to them ? Yes . I 'll take the parcel . No , sir . I 'll make the exchange . I made the deal , Scully . They 're expecting me . I don 't trustyou . There 's no one else to trust . I don 't know whoyou are . I know nothing aboutyou . For God 's sake don 't screw this up . In 1 987 , a group ofchildren from a Southern state were given what their parents thought was a routine inoculation . What theywere injected with was a clone DNA from the contents ofthat package you 're holding as a test . That 's the kind ofpeople you 're dealing with . So , why give it back to them ? To save Mulder 's life . At the risk ofother lives ? You and Mulder are the ones who can bring it to light . Now , give me the parcel . Give me the parcel , Scully . No ! Mulder . Mulder . Trust ... trust ... no one . ( Telephone Ringing ) Hello . Mulder : Hey , Scully , it 's me . Where areyou ? They 're shutting us down , Scully . What ? They called me in tonight and they said they 're going to reassign us to other sections . Who told you that ? Skinner . He said word came down from the top ofthe executive branch . Mulder ... It 's over , Scully . Lodge a protest . They can 't ... Yes , they can . What areyou going to do ? I 'm ... not going to give up . I can 't give up ... not as long as the truth is out there .

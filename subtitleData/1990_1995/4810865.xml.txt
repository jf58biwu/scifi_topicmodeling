 As soon as we 're in position , we 'll be on a count of five . Excuse me . That 's my house . - What 's going on ? - Stand by . Mrs. Budahas ? Your husband commandeered a military vehicle and is armed . Oh , my God . You 've got to let me talk to him . What the hell ... We got him , but he 's going to need a doctor ... or something . Hi . I got your message . Sorry for the runaround . Can I buy you a drink ? It 's 2 : 00 in the afternoon , Agent Mulder . That 's not stopping the rest of these people . I got something to show you . Something you couldn 't show me at work ? Let 's get a table . Okay . Mulder : That 's Colonel Robert Budahas . That photo was taken last year when he was a test pilot for the military stationed at Ellens Air Base . Four months ago , Budahas experienced a psychotic episode and barricaded himself in his home . The military police were called in . Budahas was removed and hospitalized for the treatment of his condition . - Which was what ? - The military will not comment on the cause , nature or status . - The military will not comment at all . - What do you mean ? Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months . Her inquiries have gone unanswered . Last month , she contacted the F.B.I. And reported it as a kidnapping . What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own pilots ? That 's the $ 64,000 question , Scully . Since 1963 , six pilots have been listed missing in action from Ellens Air Base . The military will say only that these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft . Yeah , there are rumors those pilots were shot down at high altitudes while they were routinely penetrating Russian airspace . There were other rumors too . I 've been tracking this case since it came through the Boise office last month . Last week , it was deprioritized . They shelved this case without an investigation , Scully . So ... So we 're going to the Spud State to investigate a kidnapping . I don 't get it , Mulder . Does this have something to do with an X-File ? I thought you only liked those paranormal-type cases . Am I missing something here ? Let 's just say this case has a distinct smell to it . A certain paranormal bouquet . Excuse me . Leave this case alone , Agent Mulder . What ? The military will not tolerate an F.B.I. Investigation . Who are you ? I , uh ... can be of help to you . I 've had a certain interest in your work . How do you know about my work ? Let 's just say that I 'm in a position to know quite a lot of things ... things about our government . Who are you ? Who do you work for ? It 's unimportant . I came here to give you some valuable advice . You are exposing yourself and Agent Scully to unnecessary risk . I advise you to drop the case . I can 't do that . You have much work to do , Agent Mulder . Don 't jeopardize the future of your own efforts . You okay , Mulder ? Yeah . I 'm fine . Hello ? Scully : Mulder , I checked on that file you gave me . You failed to tell me a few things . This isn 't some U.F.O. Goose chase you 're leading me on , is it ? Are you there , Mulder ? Yeah . The Bureau has it out for us already and it would make us appear pretty stupid if my field report read like some tabloid story . Listen , I don 't want to talk about it on this line . I 'll talk to you about it on the flight out , okay ? - Hello ? - Mrs. Budahas ? - Yes . - We 're from the F.B.I. Oh , yes . Please , come in . I started noticing it about two years ago . Bob developed this rash under his arms . We 'd been doing some renovations on the house so we thought it was a reaction to the paint stripper but then everything just went crazy . Scully : How do you mean ? Mrs. Budahas : Bob 's whole personality ... it was so unpredictable . - He started doing things ... - What kinds of things ? What kinds of things ? Mrs. Budahas : It was kind of embarrassing at first . We were having this dinner party once and he sprinkled Tetrameal D all over his food . Hmm ? That 's fish food flakes . You ever talk to him about this ? I tried . It was extremely difficult . Bob would get so angry , he 'd ... yell at the kids for no reason . And then he would shake like he was having a seizure . Did he ever talk about his work ? It was never discussed , even before the problems . I knew that he worked on top secret projects ... word gets around ... but Bob was always a patriot first . He took loyalty to his country as an oath and now they treat us like strangers ... I just want my husband back . You know the government is not above the law . They cannot withhold information . And then I think ... well , what if he 's ... How would I support the family ? You said word gets around . I 'm sorry . Have you ever heard of this happening to anyone else ? Um ... yeah . Verla McClennon 's husband ... he went kind of crazy but it 's not like he didn 't get to come home . - How long has he been ... - Almost two years . The fly-fishing idea was his brother Hank 's . I was upset at first but when you 're the wife of a test pilot you thank God just to have him home alive . Mrs. McClennon has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this ? The stress , I guess . You have to understand the military deals with things in a certain way . They 've given him plenty of therapy and treatment and I 'm thankful for that . They 've taken good care of us . And they do volunteer for their jobs . Really , Anita ... bringing the F.B.I. To my house . Here . I 've called all the numbers about 1,000 times . Please , let me know what you find out . We 're at the Beach Grove Motel if you need anything . Thanks . So what did you make of Uncle Fester ? It 's called stereotypy . It 's a syndrome produced by stress . P.O.W. S have been known to suffer from it . They 've studied it in zoo animals . Yeah , but these guys are test pilots . They 're not supposed to fold under pressure . Ever hear of something called the Aurora Project ? That 's the unacknowledged code name for some defense department surveillance project . They 've been testing a secret class of suborbital spycraft over the western U.S. Maybe these guys are flying those planes . Maybe these guys are the washouts . You saw the photos . This guy Budahas received a presidential commendation . He 's never washed out of anything in his life . Been on hold with the base director of communications . How about you ? Somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us ... a week from Friday . Yeah , right . Did you say Kissel ? - Colonel Kissel ? - Yes ? Can I talk with you ? Special Agent Mulder , F.B.I. I 've got nothing to say . This is an invasion of my privacy . Why don 't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas ? Why don 't you get the hell out of my yard ? Good thing we still kept that appointment . Hi . Are you the F.B.I. Agents ? I 'm Paul Mossinger . I work for the paper . We live near Verla McClennon . You guys are looking into this Budahas thing ? We 're just looking around . I got you . Right . A lot of people out here just looking around . U.F.O. Nuts mostly but it 's not every day we get F.B.I. By the time you hear them , they 're already gone . So this Budahas thing ... are you getting anywhere ? I 'm not at liberty to comment . Well ... Paul ... right ? You 've lived in this area a while . You ever seen a U.F. O ? Never . Bunch of hooey if you ask me . People see what they want to see . But if I wanted to talk to one of those U.F.O. Nuts you referred to earlier , where would I go ? F-15 Eagle , pulling about four G 's . Those boys think they are such hotshots . Get a few drinks in them , you 'd think it was them up there flapping their wings . Who 's the photographer ? Woman : Various and sundry . I took the one on the end there . Mulder : You 're kidding . Where ? Out on the back porch . Taking out the garbage . And there it was ... just hovering . Quiet like a hummingbird . For a minute there , I thought it was going to land and I was going to serve ' em lunch . I 'm selling limited edition prints ... $ 20 . Down to my last five , if you 're interested . - Put it on my tab . - Sucker . What would be the chances of someone like me seeing a U.F. O ? Catch you outside . You want to see something weird , Mulder ? Ellens Air Base isn 't even on my map . I know . Let 's go . You know ? Where are we going ? We got our own map , sucker . What do you honestly hope to see ? I don 't know . Maybe nothing . Is this why we came out here , Mulder ? To look for U.F.O. S ? Yeah , this is going to look real good on my field report . Scully , wake up ! You gotta see this . What are they ? I don 't know . Just keep watching . It 's unbelievable . That 's unreal . I 've never seen anything like it . They 've been going at it for half an hour . That can 't be aircraft . Aircraft can 't maneuver like that . - What else could they be ? - Lasers , maybe ... being shot from the ground , reflecting off the clouds . Oh , my God . Here comes another one . That 's not a plane . That 's a helicopter . - Hey ! - Let 's get out of here ! - Okay , don 't shoot . - Stay right there . We didn 't do anything . Come on ! That was extreme . - Let 's go . You 're coming with us . - What ? So , what exactly were you guys doing in there ? We were , um ... We were just ... We kind of have this spot . You know , we kick back and listen to some tunes and watch the air show . Were you ever chased out before ? No . Our friend showed us the hole in the fence about a year ago . One time they dropped these bombs ... Whoa . It was kind of heavy . Oh , uh , there 's this place called the Yellow Base where they 're supposed to store all this stuff . My friend said there 's land mines all around it and junk like that . I 've got a 20 . Over . Roger , Redbird . Assume fallback position . - We 're opening the cage . - Redbird out . Sometimes they come in real low and put on the skidders , right ? It 's like ... Then they just hover without making a sound , and you just think who turned down the volume , right ? What do you think they are ? Okay , everybody thinks they 're , like , U.F.O. S but I think it 's some kind of Star Wars-cybertac newfangled hardware , right ? Probably roll it out for Desert Storm II . Cruise right over Saddam 's house . He 'd be like , what ? Do they look anything like this ? No . They look exactly like that . Thanks . Later , dude . - What 's that ? - Evidence . Kids today , huh ? You believe it all , don 't you ? Why wouldn 't I ? Mulder , did you see their eyes ? - If I were that stoned ... - If you were that stoned , what ? You could have shown him a flying hamburger and he would have told you that 's exactly what he saw . I want to show you something . This is a photo of a U.F.O. That reportedly crashed in Roswell , New Mexico in 1947 . Now , I know you don 't believe that story but just hear me out . Now , Ellens Air Base , where we 're at right now ... the same base that doesn 't appear on your U.S. Government map ... is supposedly one of the six sites where parts of the wreckage were shipped . Mulder , are you suggesting that the military is flying U.F.O. S ? No . Planes built using U.F.O. Technology . Mulder , come on ! You 've got two blurry photos one of them taken almost 50 years ago and another one you purchased today , in a roadside diner . You 're out on a big limb . Tell me there isn 't a remarkable resemblance . Tell me one good reason why either of these photos is authentic . You saw what I saw tonight . What do you think they were ? Just because I can 't explain it doesn 't mean I 'm going to believe they were U.F.O.s. Unidentified flying objects . I think that fits the description pretty well . - Tell me I 'm crazy . - Mulder , you 're crazy . And it still doesn 't explain to me what happened to Colonel Budahas . You didn 't come to raid my mini-bar , did you ? - You ready for this ? - What ? We got a message from Mrs. Budahas . Her husband came home last night . We got your message . Mrs. Budahas , are you okay ? Come inside . What is it ? What ? What 's wrong ? That ... is not my husband . Honey ... who are these people ? That is not him . That is not my husband . They 've done something to him . - What are you talking about ? - It 's okay . Just relax . I 'm Special Agent Mulder from the F.B.I. We 're investigating your disappearance , Colonel Budahas . I 'm wondering if you have any explanation of your whereabouts over the past four months . - I was in the hospital . - Here ? On base ? I think so . Colonel Budahas , do you mind if I ask you your birth date ? November 21 , 1948 . - And the names of your kids . - Josh and Leslie . They 're right there . Yeah . - Green Bay fan . - Yes , sir . Bet you remember the Super Bowl of ' 68 , huh ? - Don Chandler . - Kicked four field goals . Lombardi 's last game . Why do I have to answer these questions ? It 's not him . Colonel Budahas , you 're a pilot , isn 't that right ? - Yes , sir . - Bet you 've flown just about everything with two wings . I got this hotshot pilot friend who said he could do an Immelemann at a sustained eight G 's . Is that possible ? I ... I don 't ... I can 't ... Anita . I can 't remember . No . Mulder , would you explain to me what 's going on ? I think they rewired that man 's brain ... some kind of selective memory drain . The brain doesn 't work like that . You can 't just erase certain files . - Then you explain it . - There are types of amnesia ... This is not amnesia . It 's something far more deliberate and insidious . The science or medical technology to do what you are suggesting does not exist . And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we saw last night . They can do this . That man should have known the answer to the question . It just wasn 't in his head anymore . Scully : Even if they could , why would they ? To control information . I think after his psychotic episode Colonel Budahas became a security risk . It couldn 't be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse ? I think men like Colonel Budahas are incapable of dealing with the stress of flying that aircraft . We 're talking about a technology so sensitive and advanced that it 's taken almost 50 years to make it work . U.F.O. Technology , Scully . - What the hell is this ? - Hold on ! Please , step out of the car . You think if maybe we ignore him he 'll go away ? Please , step out of the car . Guess not . Special Agent Mulder , F.B.I. We 're federal agents . You want to tell me what this is about ? National security . Now get in your car . You 'll be escorted back to your motel . You 'll pack and leave town immediately or assume the consequences of intense indiscretion . Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356 ? No plate registered under that number ? Thanks , Gail . No , no , no . I 'm sure the other one 's bogus too . Bye . So who were those guys ? I don 't think it was those kids they were chasing away from the base last night . I think it was us . They knew we were coming before we ever arrived and they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy . - There 's something I didn 't tell you . - Something else ? A man in D.C. Warned me to stay away from this case . He didn 't give me his name and my phone was being tapped . - What ? - Why would they go to all this trouble ? Out of a need for security ? Security of what ? I think there 's a huge conspiracy here , Scully . They 've got a U.F.O. Here and they 'll do anything to keep it a secret including sacrificing lives and minds of pilots because what if that secret got out ? Lf ... If ... that were true it would be a national scandal . No . You 're not thinking big enough . If it were true it would be confirmation of the existence of extraterrestrial life . Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply an experimental plane like the Stealth Bomber or this Aurora Project ? Doesn 't the government have a right and a responsibility to protect its secrets ? Yes , but at what cost ? When does the human cost become too high for the building of a better machine ? These are questions we have no business asking . Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding . Let 's get out of here , Mulder , while you still have a job . Aren 't you even curious ? Um ... I 'm going to shower , I 'll pack and then we 'll get out of here . Mulder ! Where are you going ? Right here . Hey , aren 't you guys coming ? No . We 've only gone in at night . Okay . This spot you told me about where you watched the air show , how far is it ? Uh ... 45 minutes ? - Will I be able to find it ? - Girl : Stay on the path . What about this other place ... Yellow Base with the hangar there ? Don 't . It 's like ... ten miles . Nobody 's ever been that far ! Hey , don 't go past the edge of the tall weeds . Oh , man . Did we tell him about the land mines and junk ? Hey ! Go , go ! - No ! - Come on . Hold him . Yeah , I 'm trying to make a call to Washington , D.C. And I can 't seem to get a long-distance line . Hello ? Hello ? Excuse me . My phone 's not working . - Can I use yours to make a credit card call , please ? - Sure thing . Thank you . - This one 's not working either . - Phones are undependable around here . People say it 's the military interference , but they say that about everything . Thanks . Hi . I was just looking for you . I knocked , but I saw the door was open . I was in the lobby trying to make a call . - Phones down again ? - Yeah . What are you doing ? Excuse me . There 's nothing in there . Against the car ! Hands on the car ! Do it ! Put the gun down , and we 'll talk . I said hands against the car . Who are you ? You 're a long way from home . Nobody wants to come to violence now . Where 's Mulder ? - We took him to the base . - We waited for him . Get on that walkie-talkie and find out where Mulder is . - I don 't think I can . - I think you can or I 'm going to have every newspaper writing about your experimental aircraft . There are other ways to go about this . Yeah , I 've already seen where you get with tears and a sad story . Roger . - What are we doing ? - Waiting . I want the car running . I said start the car ! And put your hands on the wheel where I can see them . You do anything stupid and this situation could get big in a hurry . You just keep telling yourself that . Keep the car running and step out of the car . Get in the car , Mulder . Get in the car ! I just want to say everything you 've seen here is equal to the protection we give it . It 's you who have acted inappropriately . You okay , Mulder ? I think so . Scully , I ... What ? How did I get here ? - Mulder : Hi . - Hello . We came by to see how your husband was doing . Oh , he 's fine . He 's getting much better now . Do you think maybe we could see him ? Um , well , he 's resting now . Budahas : Who is it now ? Thank you for your concern . They got to her , Scully . They were here . - They threatened her ... - That 's enough , Mulder ! We don 't know anything ... anything more than when we got here and that 's what I 'm going to write in my field report . Let 's get out of here , Mulder as fast as we can . Scully : Lieutenant Colonel Robert Budahas was returned to his home though his knowledge of his disappearance and whereabouts is vague and inconclusive . Special Agent Mulder 's insistence that Budahas may have been a test pilot on a top secret project involving aircraft using recovered U.F.O. technology and may have suffered severe stress-related trauma by flying these aircraft is also inconclusive . Though this agent can corroborate Agent Mulder 's eyewitness account of two unidentified flying objects in the northern sky over Ellens Air Base their exact nature or design could not be determined . Barring further authorized inquiry ... - Your lives may be in danger . - Why ? You 've seen things that weren 't to be seen . Care and discretion are now imperative . As I said , I can provide you with information but only so long as it 's in my best interest . - What is your interest ? - The truth . I did see something ... but it 's gone . They took it from me . They erased it . You have to tell me what it was . A military U.F. O ? Mr. Mulder , why are those like yourself who believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life on this Earth not dissuaded by all the evidence to the contrary ? Because all the evidence to the contrary is not entirely dissuasive . Precisely . They 're here , aren 't they ? Mr. Mulder , they 've been here for a long , long time .

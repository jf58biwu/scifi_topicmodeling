Professor Shreiman , colonel-general Nakhlobuchko . " Rais-ota , what Moskow want from us ? Are you deaf ? The telegram says that the guests arrive . Where from ? How do I know ? Probably , from there . Why do you attacked me ? I can 't ask ? So , comrades , if you meet the little person with big ears and red nose , you should go and tell me . I will deal with it . Only 5-6 person understood the message . Bazarbay discussed with Matkaul the appearance of guest . No , not that tall ! Only 70 cm ? Okay , but what did he say about hair ? He said they have no hair ! Yeah , right . And nose ? He said their noses are just like a beet ? Yes , correct . Oh , Bazarbay ... is he has nowhere else to go ? Right ! Bazarbay , come here . Look . There 's somebody there . Just come here . Look over there . In the bushes . Height : 70-80 cm . You are right ! Hello ! As-salamu alaykum ! Good evening , dear guest ! Welcome to our kishlak / little village / . We know everything about you , Rais-ota has read a telegram . Our chairman is waiting for you . If you don 't mind , you can go to my house to have some green tea . If you don 't mind . Are you nuts , Bazarbay ? It 's me , Yoldash ! I didn 't know you shaved your hair . Get out from here ! Next comes a set of untranslatable idioms . This is Nakhlobuchko Ivan Ivanovich . He is a general . It was he who wrote the telegram . Good morning , comrade general . Hi , Vanya ! Hi . She has no shame at all . Launch vehicle is fine . " Buran " is ready , fueled fuel . Start after 5 minutes . What about the telegram ? We sent it . Comrade general , the crew is ready ! Thanks God !

This is their astronaut . He looks like almost one of us . But with glasses . And this is an american rocket . I 'm sorry to say that , but american rocket has a lot of smoke . So , it flew and saw our rocket . Greeted it : - As-salamu alaykum ! - Wa alaykum as-salam ! And they flew away . Why you kicking me ? I won 't give you money , you loafer ! We have no money for 20 days ! For a month , actually . He 's drinking for a guest already ! You did the right thing ! Fool ! - The frindge doesn 't work for a hour ! - Why so ? Yeah , it doesn 't work . It doesn 't work too . One moment ! Moskow ! Good morning ! This is general Nakhlobuchko . Well ? Was anyone there ? No ! No UFO ! No plan too ! Aytalok ! That day Bazarbay lost his cow . He 's looking for her . There no cow . There too . Where are you ? God dammit ! You stupid cow ! Why you always strays from the flock ? You don 't care about the collective ? Thank me for I love you ! Otherwise you would be a sausage ! Can you see it ? Your UFO from movie was like a plate . It was beautiful , with lighting lanterns . And we had a pot-form UFO ! But anyway it was real . You are so arrogant ! I looked for you for 2 hours ! I won 't be kind anymore ! I 've lost a lot of time ! Did you hear it ? Go home ! Go . The cow was offended . What is it ? Looks like a pot ! What do you need ? Hey , boy ? Who beat you ? Nobody . I had an accident . So you 're uzbek ! But why are you do blonde ? Who anointed you with green paint ? This is not a paint . This is my blood . Listen boy , are you crazy ? Hey , how is your name ? Name ? My individual code ? That 's what you want to know ? This is weird . How 's your kolkhoz called ? " Voroshilov " or " Leninism " ? I 'm a citizen of the planet Alpha-Beta-Centurion . Hey , boy ? Are you really from there ? Why are you silent ? Hey , listen ... Maybe you 're a son of ... this drunkard Yoldash ? Come closer ... Ah , no ! I feel great here . Oh , these uzbeks ! They 're even in space ! I like you , boy ! Help me ... Why are you silent ? Wait ... Wait ... I 'll take you to the hovel . I watched a movie yesterday . It 's called " Stalker " . Andrei Tarkovsky made it . I understood nothing , but I liked it . Panasonic . What are you doing ? Taekwondo ? Get up ! Take your pants off ! I won 't do it ! Won 't do it ? Why should I ? You argue with me ? No , but I don 't want to do it !

You swallowed a balk ? Sit down . Well ... Well ... You want to talk about space guest ? Yes ! How do you know ? Last fall , I remember you brought some extraterrestrial , Yoldash , the drunkard . Disgrace for entire kishlak . If you will do same thing , people will shower you with stones . My advise is do not poke your nose into other people 's business . This is a chairman 's business . Really serious , secret thing . There is one proverb : The bear wants a tail and cannot be lion . That 's it ... Nobody listen to me . God dammit ! How are you here ? - As-salamu alaykum ! - Wa alaykum as-salam ! I brought you new shoes . And where is ... What ? Well ... your wee-wee . I haven 't it . But how do you piss ? We don 't piss . And what about marriage ? We are perfect beings , not as homo sapiens . During evolution , we have eliminated the need for reproductive organs . It was your big mistake . Well , it looks not bad . Sit down . Well , don 't be sad . Some God 's creations are like that , some are another . Eat it . What is it ? Food . Thank you . Where 's a dish ? We use disposable tableware . I bought this chinese thermos from a scalper for 17 rubles . But if i will lose a cap , I will must to throw thermos away too . So , just drink it . Thank you . So , you can not eat the dishes ! And now , dear guest ... how 's your name , by the way ? Six-digit cell ... Stop it , I don 't understand you . What name should I choose ? Promotvoy or Utkurvoy ? Wait a minute ... My grandfather 's name was Abdulladzhan . Yes , you 'll be Abdulladzhan . As you want . Oh , here you are ! My name is Abdulladzhan . Woe is me ! It 's better to die than to see all this shame ! What are you doing here ? Why are you screaming ? What happened ? A fire or what ? Why are you screaming ? I see , you are caring for your illegitimate son ! Are you lost your mind ? Where is this boy from ? He fell from the sky ! From the sky ! I know what the sky is it ! Hey , boy ! Come here ! You 're scaring the kid with your screams ! Get away ! Hey boy , come here . Don 't be scare . Come here ! Where is your mom , boy ? Where is Marusya ? In Novosibirsk ? In Barnaul ? In Barnaul , right ? ! Dad , why is this woman screaming ? You 're stupid ! You see ? He said : " dad " ! Kids are never lying ! When you 'll come home , I 'll give you a spanking ! What did you say ? Why ? I called you " dad " . I did something wrong ? As a result of logical analysis , I decided , that I 'm your son , symbolically . I 'll call all my relatives and tell them ... You said it right , son ! Let 's go . So , Bazarbay brought his 7th child to kishlak . All the people there already knew that Bazarbay brought his illegitimate son of a russian woman from Barnaul or Novosibirsk . Mulla Amylvay said , that Bazarbay is a true muslim , because the duty of every devout person is don 't leave without a care their kids in USSR . - As-salamu alaykum ! - Ah , Bazarbay ! How are you ?

That evening all the family was together . As-salamu alaykum ! Sit down ! As-salamu alaykum , dad ! So , my son-in-law , a grey beard , but a lusty heart ? Abdulladzhan , this is our family . I see . Hi . Bazarbay 's mother-in-law tried to calm down her daughter . She asked her to forgive his sin . But all children blamed their father . You ... didn 't have a moral right for that . Okay , so I had to kick this kid out ? If we don 't need him , I 'll kick him out ! Get up , Abdulladzhan ! I told you , he fell from the sky and you don 't believe me ! Oh really , dad ? Get up , son ! I 'll leave with you ! I 'll take you to orphanage and will go to nursing home myself ! We will meet every saturday ! Get up ! Why are you silent , my wife ? Okay , you go then ! Doors are not locked ! And the kid will stay here ! He 's not guilty ! I raised 6 children , so I can handle with 7th . Mom , it 's time to go home . Hey , son . Come here . Aytalok , the cow , asked : " So , you made it up ? " Bazarbay said : " I guess so " . Good morning . How did you spend the night ? Fine . Well ... So ? No . Maybe you just overslept ? How can we , Ivan Ivanovich . I 'm kidding . Next morning , we saw helicopters over our kishlak . 2 of them . This is video technician Kholmirza . He fell from the donkey when he was a kid . I have no spare parts again ! You still have not found it ? Oh , Bazarbay ! If I had the spare parts , I 'd realized my dream ! I would have gathered a VCR with my own construction !

I 'm mad ! - Let 's go ! - Where to ? - To Raykom / District Committee / . - You miss the family , son ? - Yes . Do you have a big house there ? 18 steps in diameter . 18 steps ? What a tightness ! But everyone has his own planet . You go to each other 's homes ? Why for ? We 're perfect beings . This is weird . I have to find my machine tomorrow . Next day , father and sone went to ravine . It was rainy . What looked like your machine ? It was small just as a piece of soap ! Shiny , with a small button . Abdulladzhan ! One minute ! You 're stubborn as my children . Come here , son ! I 'm all wet ! Bazarbay made a bad thing for the first time in his life . He stole someone else 's thing . You 're not tired , son ? No , dad . Where are you going ? I should find my machine ! Follow him . Hey , cat ! - Have you seen Abdulla 's machine ? - No , I haven 't ! Get away then ! Maybe it 's in blankets . What happened ? Have you seen ... a machine that looks like a soap ? Is it shiny ? Yes , it is ! With a button ? - Yes ! - No I haven 't . Rais-ota has a bad mood . I don 't know why . - Let 's go ! - Where to ? - On Kudykina mountain . - Okay . / Kudykina mountain means " Not your business " , but in this case it 's : " How do you think where ? " / Where are you going ? You said to find Kudykina mountain . Bazarbay has tormented his conscience all day . And evening too . Did you find it ? No , we didn 't . Okay , sit down son . - Son ... - Yes , dad ? You know ... I have lost your machine . Maybe someone stole it ? What means " stole " ? Well , for example , this is yours in your pocket . And now look at your homeland . And you can 't see I took it from your pocket . This is what we call " stole " . But what is it ? This is money , kid . All our troubles because of the money . Do you think it 's simple to raise 6 kids ? Look at it . I have lost all my hair . See it ? Yes , son ... Your older sister wants a big wedding . So we need money . Baltabay will need a wedding .

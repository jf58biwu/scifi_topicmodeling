 heads up ! Heads up ! Keep clear ! down ! si ! Vamonos . Keep it goin ' ! Come on ! stay ! Slow it down . No lo vayan a tirar ! Cuidado ! traigala ! move in there . Move it ! vamos ! I want tasers on full charge . Aaah ! step back in . puje ! And push ! step away . Gate keeper ! raise the gate . Aaah ! Aaah ! Block the opening ! Don 't let her get out ! Aaah ! Aaah ! Work her back ! Aaah ! Shoot her ! Shoot her ! Aaah ! Apuesto mil pesos que se cae . Juanito . Hola . Bienvenido . What 's this I hear at the airport ? Hammond 's not even here ? He sends his apologies . and you 're telling me that Hammond can 't even be bothered to see me ? He wants to be with his daughter . She 's getting a divorce . but we 've been advised to deal with the situation now . The insurance company - Okay ? The underwriters feel that the accident has raised ... some very serious safety questions about the park . very anxious . I had to promise to conduct a very thorough on-site inspection . Hammond hates inspections . They slow everything down . jefe ! That 'll slow him down more . Encontramos otros mosquitos . venga . Ooh ! Aaah ! Watch your head . the insurance guys will back off . but they think he 's too trendy . They want Alan Grant . Grant ? You 'll never get him out of Montana . mas luz ! Why not ? echenme luz ! Si . Why not ? Because Grant 's like me . He 's a digger . Que lindo eres . Vas a ser - we 're ready to try again . I hate computers . The feeling 's mutual . You 'll get a reading from that . Take a look . Did it work ? How long does this take ? It should bring an immediate return . and the bone bounces the image back . Bounces it back . This new program 's incredible . and we won 't even have to dig anymore . Where 's the fun in that ? but I don 't think it 's the computer . Oh . Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments . good shape too . I 'm guessing nine feet long . Look at the extraordinary - What 'd you do ? He touched it . Dr. Grant 's not machine compatible . they 've got it in for me . And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrist . It 's no wonder these guys learned how to fly . seriously . maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds ... than they do with reptiles . just like a bird . just like a bird . And even the word " raptor " means " bird of prey . That doesn 't look very scary . That kid 's a pistol . More like a six-foot turkey . no . try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period . You get your first look at this six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing . lightly bobbing his head . And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity ... and he 'll lose you if you don 't move . not Velociraptor . and he just stares right back . And that 's when the attack comes . but from the side . From the other two raptors you didn 't even know were there . you see . and he is out in force today . on the middle toe . say . no . He slashes at you here or here . Alan . spilling your intestines . you are alive when they start to eat you . try to show a little respect . Okay . you know . I know . Kids . You want to have one of those ? I don 't want that kid . could be intriguing . look . cheap . They smell . They do not smell . Give me a break ! Some of them smell . Babies smell . Cover the site ! Cover up the dig ! Tell them to shut down ! Shut down ! Cut the machine ! Cover it all up ! Pull it over ! will ya ? Cut it out ! Shut it down ! What ? What the hell do you think you 're doing in here ? we were saving that ! For today . I guarantee it . Dr. Grant . 000 a year has been well spent . who 's the jerk ? Dr. - Sattler . Mr. Hammond . but we 're in a wee bit of a hurry . Did I say " jerk " ? sit down . let me - I 'll just get a glass or two . I can manage this . I know my way around the kitchen . I 'll get right to the point . both of ya . I can tell instantly about people . It 's a gift . I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica . and I 've spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve . Really spectacular . Spared no expense . Make the one I 've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo . And there 's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds . honey . everyone . We 're going to open next year . if the lawyers don 't kill me first . I don 't care for lawyers . Do you ? don 't know any . I don 't really know any . I 'm afraid . represents my investors . Says that they insist on outside opinions . What kind of opinions ? not to put too fine a point on it . let 's face it . you 're the top minds . schedule . Why would they care what we think ? What kind of park is this ? It 's right up your alley . I 'll tell you what . for the weekend ? I 'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well . I 've got a jet standing by at Choteau . we - We just dug up a new skeleton . I could compensate you by fully funding your dig . And this is a very unusual time . The timing is - For a further three years . Hmm ? where 's the plane ? okay . Cheers . Cheers . Okay . Dodgson ! You shouldn 't use my name . Dodgson ! We 've got Dodgson here ! See ? Nobody cares . Nice hat . a secret agent ? Well ? Seven fifty . 000 more for each viable embryo . if you get all 15 species off the island . viable embryos . They 're no use to us if they don 't survive . Oh ! How am I supposed to transport them ? The bottom screws open . my God . It 's cooled and compartmentalized inside . that 's great ! Customs can even check it if they want to . Let me see . Oh ! Go on . There 's enough coolant inside for 36 hours . No menthol ? The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then . That 's up to your guy on the boat . 7 : 00 tomorrow night on the east dock . Make sure he gets it right . How are you planning to beat security ? I 've got an 18-minute window . and your company catches up on ten years of research . senor . Dodgson . That was Hammond 's mistake . dig up dinosaurs ? Well - We try to . You 'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm . actually . Ian . You 've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns about the island . John . Because of the behavior of the system in phase space ? of fashionable number crunching . Is not . I do wish you wouldn 't do that . you 've heard of chaos theory ? No . No ? Non-linear equations ? Strange attractors ? I refuse to believe that you ... aren 't familiar with the concept of attraction . you bring a rock star . There it is . Bad wind shears . 'cause it can be just a little thrilling . Ya-hoo ! and that piece - we 'll have landed by the time you get it right . The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place ? and the motion sensor tracking systems . relax . Try and enjoy yourself . John . This is not a weekend excursion . This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . are deeply concerned . I 'm not convinced . John . I 'llbe accepting your apologies . stop ! This shouldn 't be here . this species of veriforman 's been extinct ... since the Cretaceous Period . this thing is humongous . What ? What ? Look at that . it 's - it 's a dinosaur . Uh-huh . You did it . you did it . we could just tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness . It doesn 't apply . They 're totally wrong . This is a warm-blooded creature . This thing doesn 't live in a swamp . 30 . Thirty feet . We 're gonna make a fortune with this place . we clocked the T-Rex ... at 32 miles an hour . T - T-Rex ? Mm-hmm . You said you 've got a T-Rex ? Uh-huh . Say again . We have a T-Rex . Oh . Put your head between your knees . welcome to Jurassic Park . They 're moving in herds . They do move in herds . How 'd you do this ? I 'll show you . g 'day ! incorporating all the latest technologies . you know . Everybody has rides . we 've made living biological attractions so astounding ... that they 'll capture the imagination of the entire planet . So what are you thinking ? That we 're out of a job . Don 't you mean " extinct " ? why don 't you all sit down ? sit down . here . Here he comes . here I come . Yes . hello . Say hello . Say hello . Hello . H - Hello . I 've got lines . I guess . But how did I get here ? let me show you . your blood . Right . that hurt . it 's all part of the miracle of cloning . John . Hello . Cloned from what ? Loy extraction has never recreated an intact D.N.A. strand . Not without massive sequence gaps . Paleo-D.N.A. from what source ? Where do you get a 100-million-year-old dinosaur blood ? Shhh ! What ? What ? Mr. D.N.A. ! Where did you come from ? From your blood . Just one drop of your blood contains ... the building blocks of life . A D.N.A. strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing . left their blueprints behind for us to find . We just had to know where to look . just like today . even dinosaurs . the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree ... and get stuck in the sap . the tree sap would get hard ... preserving the mosquito inside . waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside . Until Jurassic Park scientists came along . and bingo . : dino D.N.A. A full D.N.A. strand contains three billion genetic codes . it 'd take two years to look at the entire D.N.A. strand . It 's that long . it 's full of holes . Now that 's where our geneticists take over . Thinkin 'machine super-computers and gene sequencers ... break down the strand in minutes . And virtual-reality displays show our geneticists the gaps in the D.N.A. sequence . We use the complete D.N.A. of a frog to fill in the holes ... and complete the code . Phew ! we can make a baby dinosaur . This score is only temporary . of course . Rum-pum-pum ! A march or something . It hasn 't been written yet . the tour moves on . lookie here ! Those hard-workin 'cowpokes you see behind the glass - John . auto-erotica ? no . Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park . ... D.N.A. in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs . Wait a minute . How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis ? shortly . a whole team of genetic engineers - it 's kind of a ride . three . Uh - You can 't do that . What ? Can they do that ? A reminder . : The boat for the mainland will be leaving at 1900 hours . All personnel be at the dock no later than 1845 . No exceptions . sir . Oh . It 's turning the eggs . perfect timing . I 'd hoped they 'd hatch before I had to go to the boat . why didn 't you tell me ? I insist on being here when they 're born . come on . little one . Come on . then . then . push ! God . come on ! then . There you are . There you are . There . They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with . That 's it ! Helps them to trust me . I 've been present for the birth ... of every little creature on this island . surely not the ones that have bred in the wilds . they can 't breed in the wild . Population control is one of our security precautions . There 's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park . How do you know they can 't breed ? because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female . Oh . We 've engineered them that way . There you are . my God ! Look at that . Blood temperature seems like about high 80 's maybe . 91 . yeah . That 's incredible . Ooh . how do you know they 're all female ? does somebody go out in the park and pull up the dinosaurs ' skirts ? We control their chromosomes . It 's really not that difficult . All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway . They require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male . We simply deny them that . the kind of control ... it 's not possible . it 's that life will not be contained . it expands to new territories ... there it is . There it is . You 're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed ? finds a way . What species is this ? Uh ... it 's a velociraptor . You bred raptors ? we laid on lunch for you before you set out into the park . Alejandro - Oh . What are they doing ? Feeding them . I believe . shall we ? They should all be destroyed . my game warden from Kenya . but knows more about raptors than anyone . What kind of metabolism do they have ? What 's their growth rate ? and I do mean lethal . but the way these things move - Fast for a biped ? Cheetah speed . if they ever got out in the open . And they 're astonishing jumpers . yes . That 's why we 're taking extreme precautions . The viewing area set down below here ... Do they show intelligence ? we assumed that - They 're extremely intelligent . Even problem-solving intelligence ; especially the big one . but she took over the pride ... and killed all but two of the others . you can see she 's working things out . That 's why we have to feed ' em like this . She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . right ? but they never attack the same place twice . They were testing the fences for weaknesses systematically . They remember . Yes . Well . Who 's hungry ? More adventurous guests ... can opt for ourjungle river cruise or for a close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs - but the park will open with the basic tour you 're about to take . Other rides will come on-line six or twelve months after that . Absolutely spectacular designs . Spared no expense . 000 a day . And people will pay it . Then there 's the merchandise . I can personally advise - Donald . Donald . This park was not built to cater only for the super rich . Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals . Sure . They will . a coupon day or something . um ... staggers me . but I think things are a little bit different ... than you and I feared . Yeah . They 're a lot worse . let him talk . I want to hear every viewpoint . I really do . inherent in what you 're doing here ? but you wield it like a kid that 's found his dad 's gun . - It 's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations - - If I may . I 'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you 're using here . it didn 't require any discipline to attain it . you read what others had done and you took the next step . so you don 't take any responsibility ... for it . packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunch box . And now you 're selling it . You wanna sell it . Well - I don 't think you 're giving us our due credit . Our scientists have done things which nobody 's ever done before . they didn 't stop to think if they should . Condors . Condors are on the verge of extinction . no . you wouldn 't have anything to say . Hold on . This isn 't some species that was obliterated by deforestation ... or the building of a dam . and nature selected them for extinction . especially from a scientist . how can we stand in the light of discovery and not act ? penetrative act that scars what it explores . What you call discovery ... I call the rape of the natural world . the question is : How can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem ? how could you ever assume that you can control it ? You have plants in this building that are poisonous . You picked them because they look good ; if necessary . if there 's one person here ... who could appreciate what I 'm trying to do - and we 're all running to catch up . have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together . How can we possibly have the slightest idea of what to expect ? I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it . and the only one I 've got on my side is the bloodsucking lawyer . Thank you . Well . They 're here . You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park . Spend a little time with our target audience . - Grandpa ! - Kids ! Wait ! Careful with the old man . We miss you . Thanks for the presents . We loved the presents . They were great . Did you enjoy the helicopter ? and we all went right up . come away . Not too close to the cars . Aren 't they lovely ? Aren 't they glorious ? These will be your transports for the afternoon . no . No drivers . They 're electric . They run on this track in the middle of the roadway . Totally non-polluting . Top of the line . Spared no expense . It 's an interactive CD-ROM ! Look ! You just touch the screen and it talks about whatever you want . you 're all right in there . come in the second car . Dr. Sattler . I read your book . that 's ... that 's great . Do you really think that dinosaurs turned into birds and that 's where they all went ? a few species may have evolved along those lines . They sure don 't look like birds to me . hit the earth someplace in Mexico and made this big crater ? uh - Tim . which car were you planning on ? Whichever one you are . Then I heard about this thing in Omni ... meteor making all this heat . and they died because of the weather . Then my teacher tells me about this book by a guy named Bakker . He says - She said I should ride with you because it 'd be good for you . The boat is now loading . Everyone must be on the dock for the 1900-hour departure . National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm ... National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm ... about 75 miles west of us . Aye-yi-yi-yi . Why didn 't I build in Orlando ? I 'll keep an eye on it . Maybe it 'll spring south like the last one . start the tour program . Hold onto your butts . And why did they put the fiberglass thing ? I know . What kind of dinosaurs are we gonna see now ? no . It 's driving . right ? God help us . We 're in the hands of engineers . the appropriate information ... will be automatically selected and displayed for you . look ! Simply touch the area of the screen displaying ... the appropriate icon . Are we gonna hit that ? Welcome to Jurassic Park . King Kong ? The voice you 're now hearing is Richard Kiley . called Dilophosaurus . shit ! allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure . I can 't see . This makes Dilophosaurus ... a beautiful but deadly addition ... to Jurassic Park . Alan ... where ? Damn . Vehicle headlights are on and they 're not responding . Those shouldn 't be running off the car batteries . Item 151 on today 's glitch list . and the computers aren 't even on their feet yet . and you have butterfingers ? I 'm totally unappreciated in my time . You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days . You think that kind of automation is easy ? Or cheap ? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines ... and debug two million lines of code for what I bid for this job ? I 'd love to see him try . I 'm sorry ... but they are your problems . you 're absolutely right . Everything 's my problem . Dennis . I really will not . There 's been hardly any debate at all . but I do ask that they pay for them . Dad . Dennis ! The headlights . okay ? Okay ? It 'll eat a lot of compute cycles . We 'll lose part of the system for a while . There 's a finite amount of memory . for crying out loud ? Quiet ! All of you ! They 're approaching the tyrannosaur paddock . God creates dinosaurs . God destroys dinosaurs . God creates man . Man destroys God . Man creates dinosaurs . Dinosaurs ... eat man . Woman inherits the Earth . We 'll try to tempt the Rex now . Keep watching the fence . What 's gonna happen to the goat ? He 's gonna eat the goat ? Excellent . kid ? You never had lamb chops ? I happen to be a vegetarian . T - Rex doesn 't want to be fed . He wants to hunt . Can 't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct . eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs ... right ? Hello ? H-Hello . Yes ? I really hate that man . or park schedules . of chaos . I 'm still not clear on chaos . Wh-What does that mean ? unpredictability in complex systems . the Butterfly Effect . and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine . I go too fast . I did a fly-by . I missed it . Give me that glass of water . We 're going to conduct an experiment . but that 's okay . put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic . Say a drop of water falls on your hand . Which way is the drop going to fall off ? Which finger ? I 'd say . Aha . Okay . Now freeze your hand . Don 't move . start with the same place again . the same way . S - Same way . Back the same way . It changed . It changed . Why ? Because tiny variations : look at this . imperfections in the skin - just ... microscopic . Microscopic . And never repeat and vastly affect the outcome . That 's ... what ? Unpredictability . Right . There . Look at this . See ? suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle . Alan ? another example . talking to myself . that 's chaos theory . Stop the program . Stop the program . I told you how many times ... we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors ? Stopping park vehicles and rebooting program . We 're on . Will notify for resume . I 'll switch it over to TelePromp Ter . What about the circuit integrities ? Screen says faulty sensor . I 'll call security . We 're a full go on that . Looks good . - and he says the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases . - Where are we going ? You see something ? Is there anybody else who thinks we shouldn 't be out here ? His book was a lot fatter than yours was . Really ? honey . Hey . You okay ? watch . come on . Watch this . whoa . Everybody stay here . Timmy - wow . Okay ? Of course . Don 't be scared . It 's okay . Muldoon tranquilized her for me . She 's sick . my God . baby . baby girl . Yeah . She was my favorite when I was a kid . she 's the most beautiful thing I ever saw . It 's okay . Microvesicles . That 's interesting . Thanks . What are her symptoms ? labored breathing . Right . It seems to happen about every six weeks or so . Six weeks . These are dilated . Take a look . They are ? It 's okay . I 'll be damned . That 's pharmacological . From local plant life . Is this West Indian lilac ? but the animals don 't eat ' em . Are you sure ? Pretty sure . There 's only one way to be positive . I 'd have to see the dinosaur 's droppings . droppings ? Yeah . I got that . That storm center hasn 't dissipated or changed course . I 'm afraid . Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off . Are you sure we have to ? It 's not worth taking the chance . Well - 45 knots . Tell them when they get back in the cars . last shuttle leaving for the dock ... leaves in approximately five minutes . Drop what you 're doing and leave now . Damn ! That is one big pile of shit . You 're right . There 's no trace of lilac berries . though . so she 's suffering from Melia toxicity ... every six weeks . Let 's see . Rats . Nada . um ... tenacious . You have no idea . You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything ? I have to insist that we get moving . I 'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the trike . Sure . I 'm in a gas-powered jeep . I can drop her off at the visitor 's center before I make the boat . Then I 'll catch up with you . You sure ? Yeah . I wanna stay with her a little longer . then . Okay . Now ! we gotta go ! You gotta give me the time . I did a test run on this thing . It took me twenty minutes . but you gotta give me at least fifteen minutes . No promises ! Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage . So much for our first tour . Two no-shows and one sick triceratops . John . A lot worse . Anybody want a soda or something ? maybe I 'd get somebody something . and I 'm gonna get something salty . uh - I finished debugging the phones . I was gonna debu - So I did . so I debugged the phones . I should tell you the system is gonna be compiling ... eighteen to twenty minutes . but it 's nothing to worry about . It 's a simple thing . three . I love kids . Hmm . Anything at all can and does happen . for that matter . You married ? I 'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs . Malcolm . one . That 's odd . What ? Door security systems are shutting down . didn 't he ? is she ? I 'm sorry . uh - Yeah . what 'd I touch ? you didn 't touch anything . We stopped . whoa . What the hell ? What the hell ? What now ? Fences are failing all over the park . Find Nedry ! Check the vending machines . Look at this workstation . What a complete slob . are they ? no . They 're still on . Why the hell would he turn the other ones off ? Access main program . Access main security . Access main program grid . uh ! You didn 't say the magic word . uh ! Please ! Goddamn it ! I hate this hacker crap ! Call Nedry 's people in Cambridge . uh ! Phones are out too . uh ! Where did the vehicles stop ? Their radio 's out too . Gennaro said to stay put . Kids okay ? I didn 't ask . Why wouldn 't they be ? Kids get scared . What 's to be scared about ? It 's just a little hiccup in the power . I didn 't say I was scared . I didn 't say you were scared . I know . Boo ! where did you find those ? Under my seat . Are they heavy ? Yeah ! Then they 're expensive . Put ' em back . Don 't scare me . cool . Night vision . Do you feel that ? Maybe it 's the power tryin ' to come back on . What is that ? Where 's the goat ? Jesus ! He left us . He left us . Where does he think he 's going ? you gotta go . Dr. Grant ? do I hate being right all the time . Keep absolutely still . Its vision is based on movement . Turn the light off . Turn the light off . Turn the light off ! Turn - Turn it off ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! You 're the one who turned it - No ! Hey ! God . freeze ! Get the kids ! Get rid of the flare ! Get the kids ! Get rid of the flare ! full of grace . The Lord be with me - Aaah ! No ! No ! Aaah - I got ya . I 'm stuck ! The seat 's got my feet ! I 'll get you next . You 're okay . Dad ! Dad ! You 're all right . Tim ! Tim ? Don 't move . He can 't see us if we don 't move . wait ! Timmy ? Timmy ! Tim ! Lex ! Lex ! You 're chokin ' me ! Grab the wire ! safety space minus O. He 's turning the safety systems off . He doesn 't want anybody to see what he 's about to do . Look at this next entry . It 's the kicker . " White rabbit object . the computer didn 't file the keystrokes . The only way to find them is to go through the computer 's lines of code one by one . How many lines of code are there ? About two million . Two million ? Yeah . I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough ... to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren . Sure . I 'm going with him . the magic word - uh ! I can 't get Jurassic Park back on-line without Dennis Nedry . Should have been there by now . No damn good . damn ! There 's the road ! Winch this sucker off the thing and then I tie it to that thing there and then I ... pull down this thing here and I - Oh . Oh ! My glasses ! I can afford more glasses . geez ! you got time . You can do it ! Dennis ! Hello ? that 's nice . Gotta go . nice boy . Nice boy ! Nice dinosaur . I thought you were one of your big brothers . You 're not so bad . What do you want ? You want food ? Look at me . I just fell down a hill . I 'm soakin ' wet . I don 't have any food ! I have no food on me . I have nothing on me . Play fetch ? Play fetch ? see ? See stick ? stick . boy ! You like the stick ? No wonder you 're extinct . I 'm gonna run you over when I come back down . Aaah ! Aaah ! Timmy ? Timmy ! Tim ! listen to me . I 'm right here . but I have to go help your brother . So I want you to stay right here and wait for me ! He left us . He left us ! But that 's not ... what I 'm gonna do . Okay ? Stay here . Timmy ? Tim ? You hear me ? I 'm coming up . I hate climbing . I hate trees . Way too high . goddamn tree . Tim ? Tim ? Tim . You okay ? You okay ? I threw up . that 's okay . Just give me your hand . I won 't tell anyone you threw up . just give me your hand . I gotcha . Come on . Okay . That 's good . Over the wheel . Don 't pull me too hard . No hurry . Stand on the door . Hang onto me . I got you . Okay . it is . Just like coming out of a tree house . Did your dad ever build you a tree house ? me too . never look down ! This is impossible . 50 feet - I 'm gonna help you - go ! go ! Tim ! jump ! Tim ! Well ... we 're back ... in the car again . at least you 're out of the tree . Where 's the other car ? Where 's the other car ! Alan ! Dr. Grant ! Alan ! Grant ! I think this was Gennaro . I think this was too . I think it 's ahead of us . it can wander in and out of any paddock it likes . He put a tourniquet on . Ian . Ian ! Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend . Can we chance moving him ? Please chance it . come on ! wait . The other car ! Dr. Grant ? Alan ! They 're not here . Anybody hear that ? um - It 's an impact tremor is what it is . I 'm fairly alarmed here . now ! Right now ! go ! Let 's go ! Start the engine ! Must go faster ! Here it comes ! Fifth gear ! Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! Get off the stick ! Bloody move ! Look out ! Down ! Think they 'll have that on the tour ? Are you hearing this ? hurry up . no . it 's okay . Try up here . I don 't want to . man . I hate trees . They don 't bother me . you weren 't in the last one . brachiosaurs . They 're singing . shh ! Lex . They 're just animals . These are herbivores . but for you I think they 'd make an exception . I hate the other kind . The other kind just ... do what they do . Ooh ! Aah ! What 's that ? What are you and Ellie gonna do now if you don 't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore ? I don 't know . I guess ... we 'll just have to evolve too . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? I don 't know . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? Do-you-think-he-saurus . What do you call a blind dinosaur 's dog ? You got me . A do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex . Alan ? Yeah ? What if the dinosaurs come back while we 're asleep ? I 'll stay awake . All night ? All night . Hmph . They were all melting . Malcolm 's okay for now . I gave him a shot of morphine . They 'll be fine . Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert ? You know the first ... attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland ... Petticoat Lane . Really quite wonderful . a merry-go - A carousel . Huh . And a seesaw . people would say they could see the fleas . Mummy . Can 't you see the fleas ? Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade . I wanted to show them something that wasn 't an illusion . Something that was real . Something that they could ... see and touch . An aim not devoid of merit . John . You have to feel it . You 're right . You 're absolutely right . Hiring Nedry was a mistake . That 's obvious . We 're overdependent on automation . everything 's correctable . John . Creation ... is an act of sheer will . it 'll be flawless . It 's still the flea circus . It 's all an illusion . When we have control again - You 've never had control . That 's the illusion ! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place ! But I made a mistake too . I didn 't have enough respect for that power and it 's out now . The only thing that matters now ... are the people we love . Alan and Lex and Tim . they 're out there where people are dying . So - It 's good . Spared no expense . it 's okay . It 's a brachiosaur . veggie-saurus . girl . Come on . baby . Yo ! All right ! I 'm not letting go ! maybe . Can I touch it ? Sure . Just think of it as ... kind of a big cow . I like cows . girl . up here . God bless you ! now she 'll never try anything new . She 'll just sit in her room and never come out and play on her computer . I 'm a hacker ! That 's what I said . You 're a nerd . I am not a computer nerd . I prefer to be called a hacker . God . You know what this is ? It 's a dinosaur egg . The dinosaurs ... are breeding . my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls . Amphibian DNA . What 's that ? the film said they used ... frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps . They mutated the dinosaur genetic code ... and blended it with that of frogs . some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex ... from male to female in a single sex environment . Malcolm was right . Look . Life found a way . that 's crazy . You 're out of your mind . what exactly would this mean ? which is about the only option left to us . We will never find the command that Nedry used . He 's covered his tracks far too well . I think it 's obvious now that he 's not coming back . shutting down the entire system - because I won 't do it . Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything that he did . all the systems will then come back ... correct ? yes . But we 've never shut down the entire system before . It may not come back on at all . Will we get the phones ? in theory . What about the lysine contingency ? We could put that into effect . What 's that ? That is absolutely out of the question . The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals ... in case they ever get off the island . Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism . The animals can 't manufacture the amino acid lysine . they slip into a coma and die . People ... are ... dying . Will you please shut down the system ? Hold onto your butts . Um . It 's okay . Look . See that ? It 's on . It worked . it worked ? Everything 's still off . Maybe the shutdown tripped the circuit breakers . reboot the system : but it worked . System 's ready . Where are the breakers ? the other end of the compound . I can have power back on in the entire park . I want everybody in the emergency bunker ... until Mr. Arnold returns and the whole system is running again . my legs hurt . guys . The visitors center is just about a mile over that rise . Just ... keep - What is that ? can you tell me what they are ? gala - gallimimus . meat-eating ? meat-asaurusses ? Look at the wheeling . Uniform direction changes ... just like a flock of birds evading a predator . uh - They 're flocking this way . I wanna go now . Look how it eats . Please ! I bet you never look at birds the same way again . Yes . Go now . Okay . Keep low and follow me . Look how much blood . God . Something went wrong . Something 's happened . Something 's wrong . This is just a delay . All major theme parks have delays . nothing worked . John . the pirates don 't eat the tourists . I can 't wait anymore . Something went wrong . I 'm gonna go get the power back on . you know . Don 't let 's be too hasty . He 's only been gone - I 'm going with you . Okay . Sorry . but I think I can follow this and then talk you through it . Right . uh ... it ought to be me really going . um - let 's go . We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back . You just take me through this step-by-step . I 'm on channel two . Right . God . The shutdown must have turned off all the fences . even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fences . this way . I can see the shed from here . We can make it if we run . No . We can 't . Why not ? Because we 're being hunted . straight ahead . It 's all right . Like hell it is . Run . Towards the shed . I 've got her . Go ! Now ! Mr. Arnold ? I 'm in . ahead of you is a metal staircase . Go down it . Okay . Going down . After 20 or 30 feet you come to a T-junction . Take a left . Have her follow the main cable . I understand how to read a schematic . I guess that means the power 's off . That 's not funny . That was great . we could - Damn it . Dead end . wait a minute . There should have been a right turn back there somewhere . look above you . There should be a large bundle of cable and pipes all heading in the same direction . - Follow that . - Okay . Following the piping . I bet I could climb over the top ... and be on the other side before you could get to the top . What would you give me ? Respect . it 's not a race . I see the box . It says " high voltage . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Good . Here we go . Over the top . Tim . That 's good . Come on . Find your footing . Find your footing . you can 't throw the main switch by hand . You 've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge . flat and gray . here I go . Okay ? four . Okay . Charged . Under the words " contact position " ... push to close . Push to close . " Okay . Push it . Ah ! the red buttons turn on the individual park systems . Switch ' em on . Timmy ! You 're gonna have to jump ! Get down now ! You crazy ? I 'm not gonna jump . three ! Control room . Tour . I 've gotta get Tim . Okay . I 'm gonna count to three . two - Timmy ! Timmy ! He 's not breathing . I think we 're back in business ! my God ! Goddamn ! Mr. Arnold . Clever girl . Tim ! Tim ! good boy . Tim . Three . Hello ? get you to a doctor . you look after Tim . Hey ! Yeah . Your hair is all sticking up . the human piece of toast . I 'll be back soon . I promise . Ellie ! - Run . - Ellie ! right ? You sure the third one 's contained ? Yes . Unless they figure out how to open doors . what is it ? It 's a velociraptor . It 's inside . Follow me . It 's in there . Control room . We can call for help ? We gotta reboot the system first . The door locks ! boot up the door locks ! God ! boot up the door locks ! get back ! Boot up the door locks ! You can 't hold it by yourself ! It 's a UNIX system . I know this . It 's all the files of the whole park . It tells you everything . I gotta find the right file . Try to reach the gun ! I can 't get it unless I move . this is it ! This might be the right file . Wait . It 's coming . This isn 't the right file . Lex ! Oh ! You got it ? Yes ! You got it ! this is it ! Yes ! we got it . the phones are working . The children all right ? The children are fine . Call the mainland . Tell ' em to send the damn helicopters . Gonna cut through the glass ! Grant ! Grant ! move ! let go . Yeah . Aaah ! Hold onto me ! Mr. Hammond ! I 've decided ... not to endorse your park . So have I. Subtitled by renshaw

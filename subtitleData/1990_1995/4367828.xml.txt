 NARRATOR : That was the scene in California ' s Mojave Desert , five years ago . Our historic first view of the Newcomers ' ship . Theirs was a slave ship , carrying a quarter-million beings ... bred to adapt and labor in any environment . But they 've washed ashore on Earth ... with no way to get back to where they came from . And in the last five years , the Newcomers have become the latest addition ... to the population of Los Angeles . Nu-Knit was first manufactured over a decade ago ... Nu-Knit was first manufactured over a decade ago ... aboard the Newcomer slave ship . Its incredible durability ... far surpasses any human synthesized fabric ... whether it be cellulose , petroleum , or polymer-based . The fibers are so strong , the weave so dense ... that Nu-Knit cannot be cut by traditional means . At the factory , we use lasers . This same fiber strength and density of weave ... gives Nu-Knit a truly out-of-this-world stain resistance . Just take a look at this . Even this commercial motor oil can 't soak in . It simply rinses off clean . Nu-Knit is a tremendous gift of Tenctonese technology . We humans owe a great debt to my partner ... who reconstructed the process , bringing this amazing fabric to us . Mr. Edgar Allan Poe . And that 's his lovely wife , Rita . Earth 's gift in return to this great scientist . All of you here tonight are very special people ... respected members of the community . And we would like to personally invite you ... to join the Nu-Knit family by becoming limited partners . Permits are in place for our expansion . And the Department of the Environment has given us the green light . As you can see from our prospectus ... we anticipate a 25 % return on our investment . And after our deal is finalized with the US Army to manufacture uniforms ... that estimate will jump to 40 % . Now , whether or not you decide to invest ... each of you will receive a free complimentary gift ... just for being here tonight ... in this beautiful replica of the caves of Tencton . Your own Nu-Knit vest . As the Tenctonese say : [ ln Tenctonese ] Thank you . Good speech , Lee . I always get so tongue-tied . That 's okay , Cyril ... all you got to do is keep balancing those books . You were wonderful . What did you think , Edgar ? We have to talk . Excuse us . - What do you think , $ 2,000 ? - That 's nothing , George . Let 's invest $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 . But , Susan , we don 't have that kind of money . George , I 'm working now . We have $ 10,000 in that money market account ... just sitting there at 6 % . They 're talking 40 % . If we did invest , say , $ 4,000 , we 'd have a return of ... $ 1,600 . If we invested $ 7,000 ... that would be a return of $ 2,800 the first year . Roll that over , in three years we 'd have almost $ 1 1,000 . Let 's invest all $ 10,000 . Okay . [ Door opening ] GEORGE : We 've always wanted to have a UV Room- - [ Whispering ] We could do that now . Vessna 's so energetic ... I 'd love to buy her an oddyash wheel she could climb in her nursery . I saw a lovely one at Bullock 's . - Go ahead . Buy it . - What did you guys decide ? The best thing for our future . And how is our little Vessna ? - You invested , didn 't you ? - A little . [ ln Tenctonese ] They 're taking advantage of unskilled Tenctonese workers ... who have to put in double shifts at minimum wage with no overtime pay . Buck , you don 't know that . No . Marilyn says the Nu-Knit workers have no healthcare , no benefits . - Marilyn ? Who 's Marilyn ? - My American history teacher . - See , we 're studying the labor movement . - You call your teacher by the first name ? Marilyn 's not into any kind of power trip . Marilyn says Nu-Knit is exploiting its Tenctonese workers . If she 's so smart , why don 't you ask this Marilyn ... where these " exploited " workers would be without Nu-Knit . No , I will tell you where . Unemployed , that 's where . [ ln Tenctonese ] What are they teaching kids in school these days ? Neemu , calm down . You know , you look very handsome in a tuxedo . Sergeant . Thanks , Al . Moonlighting last night . - That must be fun . - Damn ! Every day you buy three of these tickets and scratch the aluminum off . Three is a lucky number , Albert . So that 's why you do it ? Because it 's fun ? No . You win money . See , three pineapples in a row , that 's $ 25,000 . Just for scratching off some aluminum ? That 's a lot of money . I could buy so many trees . Trees ? You buy trees ? For the city . The city needs more trees . No , Albert , the idea is , you win money ... and then you buy something you really like . Something you couldn 't afford , something really great . Like a car . - But you already have a car . - No , I have a car , I don 't have the car . Albert , you know what that is ? That is happiness . A ' 63 split-window Vette . A ' 63 split-window Vette . 340 horsepower ... four-speed pull , positraction , 0 to 60 in seven seconds . But it 's more than that , Albert . The car is ... fine . - Fine . - Yeah . Good morning . einstein : Good morning , George . George , that is a very nice vest . Why , thank you , Albert . Man , does it glow in the dark ? What 's this ? Ketchup . - ls this some new alien thing ? - l 'm glad you asked . As you can see , my Nu-Knit vest is incredibly stain-resistant . - Nu-Knit ? - Yes . A gift of Tenctonese technology ... which is now being synthesized here in Los Angeles . Susan and I have just become limited partners . It 's a very sound investment . I got your sound investment . Now that is nothing but an extravagant fantasy . In the year I 've known you , you 've spent over $ 750 on lottery tickets . I won $ 25 last month , okay . You just wait and see , George . A pineapple ... a peach ... and a banana ! What 'd you win ? Nothing , Albert . Nothing at all . Sgt. Sikes , could I do one ? Albert , they don 't give these away for free . I 'll pay for it . It 's a waste of money . - Please . - lf you insist . If he insists , huh ? Just don 't blame me . You 're just throwing away your money , Albert . One pineapple ... two pineapples ... . What are you doing ? Go on . This is fun . I 'm gonna save the rest for later . They had no right to bust me , no right ! The guy swung at me first ! Come on , take it easy . I 'm gonna get you for this . I 'm gonna get you . Look. I don 't want no problem out of you . - You got one phone call . - Go to- - MATT : Look out , George ! - Hold him . - No right ! No right ! Get a doctor in here ! No , I 'm all right . My vest . It didn 't go through . - l 'm bruised , but I 'm all right . - Man , don 't scare me like that . Amazing . is it too late to get in on this ? George , we got 10 minutes left on our break. I need to go to the bank . - l gotta get some cash . - Matt , this vest saved my life . The least I can do is thank them . Besides , I own a piece of this company . Do you realize what that means to a former slave ? - No. I want to see it . - Okay . Let 's just not take all day . Matt , your hat . Remember the hole in the ozone . - Yeah . Okay , mother ? - You need a mother . LEE : Workers here don 't need a union . They don 't want a union . marilyn : Then why do you object to giving them a choice ? You don 't work here . You don 't understand the situation . We understand basic needs , we understand dignity . I know your group . You come here to stir up trouble . And I 'm not gonna let that happen . Now get out of here , both of you ! BUCK : Fine. lf that 's management 's position , we 'll go talk to the workers . That sounds like- - BUCK : These are your own people . How could you do this to them ? Out ! Get out now ! Dad . Oh , boy . - What are you doing here ? - Why aren 't you in school ? I have a free lunch period . - This is your son ? - Yes . What 's this all about ? Your son and this woman came here ... on behalf of a so-called citizens group , agitating for a union . Dad , this is Marilyn , my teacher . You drag your students into your personal politics ? I wanted to come. I insisted . Do you realize your father has a considerable investment in this company ? That 's his problem . Mr. Francisco , I 'm sorry we had to meet like this . You 'll have to forgive my son . He 's young . - See if you can talk some sense into him . - Yes , I will. I 'm sorry . [ Matt chuckling ] Well , you old robber baron , you . Looks like this sound investment of yours is causing a little domestic strife . What you say ? You want to take a peek ? See how they 're exploiting the workers ? All right . [ Newcomer grunting ] I don 't know what they 're bitching about . This is a real garden spot . Just because it looks unpleasant doesn 't mean it 's harmful in any way . - Matt ? - l can 't breathe . Matt ! Why hadn 't anything been done about that leak ? No one noticed . You see , the fumes don 't bother the Newcomers ... and only Newcomers work in there . That 's no excuse . There should 've been warning signs ... to protect humans in case things like this happen . - Are you all right , Matt ? - Yeah. I 'm okay . - You sure you don 't want a doctor ? - No , I 'm fine . Let 's go . CYRlL : I 'll see you out . Get those signs up . Don 't look so glum . Everything 's okay . I 'm sick of you . I 'm sick of your lies . It 's not easy running a business . There are bound to be oversights . Man , my head is killing me . I need an aspirin . Francisco , I just had my broker invest $ 5,000 in this . - lt 's a winner , right ? - l can 't think of a better investment . - Nu-Knit is one-of-a-kind . - So was the Edsel . Albert ! Damn , where 's Albert ? He went to collect his money . Money . What money ? Three pineapples . He won the lottery . It 's always an alien , eh , Sikes ? [ Suspenseful instrumental music ] I bust my hump working two jobs and pulling overtime ... just to make the boat payments ... and what happens ? E.T. comes along and wins the lottery . There ought to be a law . I mean , they weren 't even born here . $ 25,000 . Now I really do feel sick . Matt , I just heard that Albert won the lottery . Did Matt tell you that he was the one who sold Albert the ticket ? It was Matt 's ticket . You know , George , you got a really big mouth . Isn 't it ironic that after all the times you 've lost ... the one ticket that would 've made you the winner is ... . Albert . [ Speaking Tenctonese ] - Aren 't you going to congratulate him ? - Yeah . Congrats . You were right , Sgt. Sikes , three is a lucky number . It was the third ticket , and three pineapples . Better put that money in the bank , Albert . - l 've already spent it . - That 's perfect . You know , give them a little money , they blow it right away . Give whom a little money ? Sgt. Sikes , I have a surprise . - l bought you something . - What ? Eucalyptus ? Douglas fir ? It 's outside . That is your surprise . Oh , Albert . GEORGE : This was a very foolish way to spend your money . - You could 've invested in Nu-Knit . - l 'll win again . That lottery 's easy . Albert , why ? Why 'd you do it ? einstein : You always seem so ... discontented. I wanted you to be happy . So is it " fine " ? It is so fine . - You 're not going to accept this , Matthew . - He has to accept it. I bought it for him . Yeah . He bought it for me . I have to accept it . - So you 're happy now ? - Man , I 'm so happy . Gonna take it for a spin . No , you 're not . Our general partner , Mr. Edgar Allan Poe ... was just found dead in his swimming pool . It 's a possible homicide . You and Sikes are on the case . - Francisco . - Yes ? I 'm sorry about Mr. Allan Poe , but ... remember , I have an investment in this ? Right . There you go . Grazer 's not gonna be too happy if Nu-Knit goes belly-up ... like its owner . Say , how much do you have invested ? As much as Grazer ? No . Not that much . You know , you forgot your hat . What do we have ? Homicide . Somebody poured sea salt in the water . For a Newcomer that 's like jumping into a pool of acid . - But , of course , you 'd know that . - Yes . The tissue destruction indicates ... the body had been in the water for two hours . So I 'd set the time of death at about 3 : 00 p.m. Wonder if these are Nu-Knit ? - Sorry . - Any idea when the salt was introduced ? Allan Poe 's wife said he swam twice a day ... in the morning and when he got home from work . So it had to have been between 9 : 00 a.m. and 3 : 00 p.m. - ls that the wife ? - Yes . - Human , huh ? - Doctor 's giving her a sedative . She discovered the body . Thank you . Looks like the widow made out pretty good , marrying Allan Poe . Now that 's a sound investment . Are you saying she married him for his money ? Heavens , no . Why ? Because she 's human and he 's a Newcomer ? They can 't have been in love ? Let 's just say money 's a hell of an aphrodisiac . Mrs. Allan Poe ? Police . Would you feel up to making a statement ? I 'll try . You found your husband when you got home ? It was horrible . Horrible . - lf this is too difficult now- - - No. I 'm all right . - Were you out all day ? - Yes. I left before Edgar went to work . I had a lot to do . - Mrs . Allan Poe . - l understand , Detective . I can account for my whereabouts . I 've never seen a car like this . - ls it yours ? - Yeah . - What happened to your other one ? - Nothing . Then why do you need this one ? I don 't need it , I want it . A car like this is better than sex . Really ? That 's just an expression . See , this car 's a classic. lt 's a Corvette ... - ' 63 split-window Vette . - That 's old for a car . Who wants a new one ? The ' 96s run like dogs . All that smog control stuff . Then it must get very good gas mileage . - lt gets terrible gas mileage . - Then it 's not economical ? You don 't buy a car like this because it 's economical . Economy 's no fun . By the time I pay for garage space and insurance and an alarm system ... this car 's gonna cost me a fortune . A fortune ? Cathy , this is not just a car . It 's a work of art . Like the Mona Lisa . Like the Statue of Liberty . It 's spiritual . I have always dreamed of having this car . And now , here it is . Come on , I 'll take you for a ride . Okay . Not many cars had bucket seats back in ' 63 . Or a cluster dash . [ Engine starting ] Listen to that engine ! [ Tires screeching ] What was that ? Nothing. I just have to get used to the clutch . CATHY : Sounds like your U-joint went out . MATT : Jeez . Matt , I don 't think this is better than sex . The nursery 's the first door on your left . Right . [ Thudding ] Watch the credenza . - What is that ? - Oh , hi , George . That 's Vessna 's oddyash wheel . Susan , how much did it cost ? - $ 700 . - $ 700 ? There was a cheaper one , but it had a plastic frame . Leave the door open . We 'll be right in with the chair . Chair ? What chair ? It was going to be a surprise . You know that vibrating La-Z-Boy you 've been wanting ? Susan , that chair costs over $ 2,000 . You deserve it , neemu , and anyway , we can afford it . Where was that year-old milk ? If it isn 't Karl Marx . - Hi , Dad . - Hi , Son . I 'm surprised to find you here . Shouldn 't you and Marilyn be out leading the proletarian revolution ? Dad , are you still mad about today ? Someone should tell Marilyn that she 's supposed to teach history ... not make it . Need I remind you ... that socialism was completely discredited in the ' 80s ? This has nothing to do with socialism . Need I remind you that if your mother and I lose this investment ... we won 't be able to afford those $ 300 sneakers ... in which you champion the underclass . I 'm not wearing leather anymore , only cruelty-free clothes . - What ? - Clothes no animal was killed for . Where do you think your shoes came from ? See. lt 's all part of the same sickness . Killing animals , polluting the oceans , destroying the ozone . Marilyn 's turned me onto a lot of things . Marilyn . Last night the U-joint in the Vette went out . It 's with my mechanic now . What 's that gonna cost ? You think you have problems . Susan runs our credit card to the limit with this La-Z-Boy ... and now because of Nu-Knit , our investment ... - we don 't have the savings to pay it off . - George , it 's a sound investment . Then my insurance guy tells me it 's gonna cost $ 4,000 every six months ... - just to insure the damn thing . - You wanted this vehicle . I 'm going to have to pay 22 % interest on that card . Twenty-two ? Where 'd you get 22 ? Fortunately , the technology was in place at the time of Edgar 's death . From here on in , it 's really a matter of marketing . I don 't anticipate any further expenditure in development ... - in the near future . - Okay , so- - [ lntercom buzzing ] LEE : Yeah ? receptionist : The detectives are here . Show them in . Excuse me , I 'll let you gentlemen talk . By the way , you can rest assured about your investment . The company 's in good shape . Look , I can tell you right off ... I don 't have any idea why anyone would kill Edgar . He was the sweetest guy . He had no enemies . - l just can 't believe this happened . - And when did you last see him ? The afternoon he died . You were here . That school teacher and your son , they upset him . I told him to knock off early and forget about it . How upset was he ? He 'd never had any experience with labor relations . Are you suggesting he might have committed suicide ? We 're not suggesting anything . We 're just trying to determine what happened . Do you know of anyone who may have profited from Mr. Allan Poe 's death ? I can tell you this : I had everything to lose . Without Edgar , there 's no Nu-Knit . Okay , we 're gonna need a full financial report . Investors , profit participation , everything . Of course . But if I may ... what 's that got to do with Edgar 's death ? You 're a businessman , Mr. Smith , you ought to know ... money 's a hell of a motivator . Tell me exactly what he said . " You can rest assured about your investment . " The company is in good shape . " Okay . Stay on top of it . And you 're sure about that ? Okay , thanks . That was the maitre d ' at the restaurant ... where Mrs. Allan Poe had lunch the day her husband was murdered . She said she had reservations at 12 : 00 . But the maitre d ' says she didn 't get there till 12 : 30 . He remembers because he had already given away her table . Matt , Mrs. Allan Poe said she was at the beauty salon before that . She still wouldn 't have had time to go home and put salt in the pool . Yeah . She said she was at the beauty salon till 1 1 : 30 . But the owner said by 1 1 : 00 she had already been out of there . There 's an hour and a half hole in her alibi . Let 's go have another little chat with Mrs. Allan Poe . No answer . - Car 's here . - Let 's try around back . LEE : Rita , I warned you , don 't . Rita , don 't . No , come here . Rita . Looks like the widow 's taking it hard . I love Rita , and she loves me . But how could we tell Edgar ? We both adored him . It would 've broken his heart . Yeah , it 's breaking mine . You guys thinking of tying the knot ? - We 've discussed it . Why ? - Could make for a happy ending . Edgar 's interest in Nu-Knit combined with yours . - Look , money has nothing to do with this . - What about the missing hour and a half ? Lee and I were at the Duncamp Hotel . Look , I know how that sounds . But it 's the only way that we could be alone . To be together . Can anyone substantiate your alibi ? - The desk clerk . - And room service . We had a bottle of champagne . Look , if we killed Edgar ... do you think we 'd be stupid enough to be seen like this ? I don 't know about stupid , but it sure is tacky . We love each other . That 's our only crime . - Easy , man , easy . - Come on . This way . Yeah . Okay . Thanks . Their alibi holds . Room service waiter remembers bringing them bubbly . Says Rita was wearing a black negligee . Nice color for a widow . We struck out . - George , I 'm worried . - About what ? My mechanic hasn 't called . When he doesn 't call , that 's bad news . - Matt , we have a case . - l know , I know . So , who else would want to bump off Poe ? I think I know someone we should ask . There 's still a lot of controversy over FDR . Some people feel that the WPA was the beginning of the downfall of this country . And other people believe that without the New Deal ... we would 've had a revolution on our hands . GEORGE : Ms. Houston . BUCK : Dad . Buck . - We need to talk to your teacher . - Okay , go ahead . [ ln Tenctonese ] - What 's this about ? - ls it Edgar Allan Poe ? We 're investigating his death , yeah . As an investor , isn 't this a conflict of interest ? I 'm able to maintain my professional integrity . Thank you for your concern . I 'm not going anywhere . - Buck . - No . [ ln Tenctonese ] Now , please , go home . It 's okay , Buck . You seem to have a great deal of influence over my son . I think he 's terrific . We care about the same things . Ms. Houston , you believe the workers at Nu-Knit are dissatisfied . is there anybody you know ... who would have a particular grudge against Mr. Poe ? Enough to kill him ? No . And if you consider me a suspect , I was teaching all afternoon . It 's reassuring to know that you spend some time at your job . - So you need a few extra bucks ? - Yeah , my insurance is killing me . Tell me. I thought I 'd never get that four-by paid for . I just talked to my mechanic . I knew it was gonna be bad . The whole tranny 's shot . - The tranny ? - The tranny 's gone . - That 's bad . - Talk about differential , the U-joint- - Here . This is the company I work security for . You come by 10 : 00 tonight . We will talk to the boss . - Phil , I appreciate this . This is great . - No problem at all . It 's my pleasure , buddy . - Sgt . Sikes . - Hey , Al . What 's the matter , aren 't you happy ? - Why should I be happy ? - The car . You have the car . Yeah. I 'm on top of the world . How can it have a top ? It 's round . Matt , I 've been cross-referencing Nu-Knit 's financial disclosure ... with public records . I 've found something odd . Tomorrow , George. lt 's closing time . - How 's the investigation coming ? - lt 's perplexing . [ Computer beeping ] - l found another one . - Another what ? Another limited partner who was deceased ... at the time he invested in Nu-Knit . Now this one died a year and a half before Nu-Knit was even open to investors . - How could that be ? That 's impossible . - Exactly . Look , Francisco , I made this investment on your recommendation . Captain , I never actually solicited your funds- - Francisco ... I did this without asking my wife . She says I have no business sense . You realize how serious it would be if I lost the money ? They expect us to make a full round of the premises ... in two hours . And they expect us to get from clock station 2 ... to clock station 3 in 35 minutes . It really takes about 10 . So you can sneak into the janitor 's closet and get some shuteye . - You have to wear the uniforms ? - Yeah , they 're real sticklers about that . - Anybody to talk to around here ? - The boss goes home around midnight . There is Bernard . He does inventory . He 's not real sociable . He just got out of the hospital . Swell . Phil ! Mr. Elias , this is my friend , Detective Sikes . He 's interested in a job . Phil , last night you missed clock box number 4 again . You are sleeping ! No , Mr. Elias , the key must 've jammed . Phil , don 't lie to me , okay ? I give this man your job . - He 's a great kidder . - l 'm not kidding , Phil . Tonight , you sweep the loading dock , okay ? No , Mr. Elias , I am a security guard ... not a janitor . Phil , don 't argue with me , okay ? You , buddy , you come to my office in five minutes . - You have to take that crap ? - He doesn 't mean it . You know , I don 't know about this , Phil . Well , hey , it pays the bills . - What about your car ? - Yeah , my car . Yeah , me , too . I don 't do this , I can 't afford my boat . Now , let me ask you something . When was the last time you actually got to use your boat ? Well ... . One-William-One , 52 , this is dispatch . 52 . Over . We have a Code 3 toxic spill , Riverside and Figueroa . Requesting all available units to assist in evacuation . - Put me on route . - Roger . - See you , Phil . - What about Mr. Elias ? I 'm gonna have to take a pass on Mr. Elias . - Thanks , anyway . - Take it easy . - Step back . - Coming through . - Got any people back there ? - Clear . MATT : What 's going on ? GEORGE : This tanker was involved in an accident . It jackknifed and started leaking some kind of toxic substance . The driver fled . We have no idea what the substance is or where it came from . - l know that smell . - Get a gas mask . - lt 's the same as the Nu-Knit factory . - l don 't smell anything . It doesn 't affect you guys . Remember ? I 'm telling you , this stuff came from the Nu-Knit factory . - They find Smith yet ? - l 'm expecting to hear any moment . Matt , maybe we should wait until we get ... the Department of the Environment test results . I trust your nose , trust mine . Nu-Knit 's dumping waste illegally . And I 'll bet you it ties in with Poe 's death . Nu-Knit 's dumping waste illegally . And I 'll bet you it ties in with Poe 's death . Our company . Grazer 's company . Yeah , it 's gonna spoil his day . This is just like my car . This spill is like your car ? All these nifty things we want ... they wind up costing us a lot more than we think . This is One-Adam-Six . Come in , One-William-52 . This is 52 . Over . We are at Lee Smith 's residence . The suspect is not on the premises . Roger , One-Adam-Six . I bet you I know where that lovebird is . God , Lee . Don 't worry , honey , I 'll post bail on this pollution thing ... - and I 'll be out tonight . - Not if we nail you on Murder One . LEE : I had nothing to do with Edgar 's death . GEORGE : No . Your prospectus claimed ... that the Department of the Environment gave you a clean bill of health . Clearly , it wasn 't deserved . And Poe , being a scientist , would 've been the first to discover that . If he intended to go public , that 'd be awful bad for business . You had motive , Mr. Smith . Tell them the truth , Lee . We both know you didn 't kill Edgar . Okay . Look ... under the Department of Environment 's laboratory conditions ... Nu-Knit 's by-product wasn 't hazardous . Edgar realized that outside ... in the air , mixed with Earth pollutants ... Nu-Knit 's by-product was deadly to humans . Like the leak at the factory . You experienced it . Of course I wanted to cover it up . I tried to protect my business , but I didn 't kill Edgar . - Who else knew about this ? - Besides myself , Rita . I don 't know who else Edgar might have told . - Maybe our accountant , Cyril Roman . - Okay , let 's go . LEE : What about the factory ? - We 're shutting it down tomorrow . - Do you have to do that ? I 'll pay the fines , whatever . You have as much to lose as anyone , and your captain . We 're shutting it down . Smith 's booked . - George , what happened to your vest ? - l discarded it . [ Computer beeping ] - Matt , look at this . - George , the sun 's almost up . I deserve a few hours sleep . Remember I told you I found two investors ... who passed away before Nu-Knit was started ? There 's a third . Maybe their estates made the investments . No. I 've traced all three through different brokerage houses ... to the same holding company . Fleur de Lyon Enterprises . I 'm bringing up its articles of incorporation . MATT : Cyril Roman 's a busy boy . He 's trying to gain control of Nu-Knit using these dummy investors . He would have the most to lose if Poe had gone public ... and Nu-Knit had to shut down . Nu-Knit is closed by order of the Department of the Environment ... until further notice . Please , leave the premises immediately . [ Speaking Tenctonese ] [ Newcomers murmuring ] [ Tires screeching ] There 's an exec here , Cyril Roman . He 's a Newcomer . Inside . Stop right there ! - Matt , stay clear of the fumes . - l 'll cover the front and call for back-up . George ? Talk to me , George . MATT : Excuse me . My partner , what happened to him ? Where is he ? Inside . [ Coughing ] George ! George , where are you ? George ! George , where are you ? George . Matt . Try , Matt . - Are you all right ? - You ? Thank you , Matt . Vessna and Emily are sleeping . So how did your investors meeting go ? Your friend Marilyn was there . She played a prominent role . Dad , I 'm sorry you guys lost your money ... but the workers are the ones who really got hurt . I mean , they lost their jobs . Luckily , you might be wrong on both counts . GEORGE : Marilyn 's group is preparing ... a feasibility study on converting the factory ... into a plastics recycling plant . Naturally , it will include a profit-sharing plan for the workers . We wouldn 't see a return for two years , but at least we 'd still be in business . That 's terrific . Marilyn 's great . Yes , she 's the best thing since diced bread . At least with Marilyn , you won 't be running a sweatshop . He 's passionate , sincere ... he 's committed . He 's also a royal pain in the ass . Francisco . Good morning , Captain . What 's this I hear about Nu-Knit becoming a plastics recycling factory ? That 's correct . - Any money in it ? - Plastics ? Yeah . Have another . - Good morning , Albert. ls Matthew in yet ? - l haven 't seen- - Here I am . Albert , come here . - l got something for you . - For me ? Yeah . You can come , too , George . Come on . What a great day . - You seem happy , Sgt. Sikes . - Uncharacteristically so . I am happy , Albert . Very happy . - Because of the car ? - Sort of , yeah . - ls it running well ? - l wouldn 't know. I sold it . I bought you these , Albert . I thought they 'd kind of dress up the city . I got 10 more trucks like these . You just tell them where you want them . Trees ! Yeah . Aren 't they fine ?

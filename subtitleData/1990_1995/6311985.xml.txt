 - the name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now ... Well , let 's just say " I transferred to another precinct . " - Yeah . - I 'm waiting for a friend . - Hey , lookin good tonight , honey . Not on this planet , pal . Take a hike . - Yeah , go ahead . Lose the hair , sister . This ain 't your night , pal . Hey , nice . - Thanks . - Like the Palm tree . Yeah . - He 's right . You 're lookin good tonight . - Thanks . - Wanna dance , honey ? - Sure . - You 're up , Donna . I 'll catch you later . Can I help you ? Police ! Hold it right there ! I said , " Freeze ! " Now put your hands up where I can see them . Walker , I 've got him . Walker ! Where the hell are you ! ? - Pigeon ? Pigeon , hold on . - damn ! - Out of my way ! Police ! Move ! Move- - Police ! Get out of my way ! Oh , no . - Yeah , so the next thing I know this gigantic humanoid has got me by the throat and holding me two feet off the ground . - Only two ? - Brogan , we got an officer down . East parallel road . The taunt night club . - We 're on it . Who 's the officer , fredo ? - Uh , not one of ours . She was with the 79th , working under cover . - You better send some back up , fredo . Crowd control could be a problem . - Took and Casper are on their way , lieutenant . - Come on Womack ! I quit the streets . You know that . I 'm a physical therapist . - Yeah , and I 'm the Duke of danai . - Why thank you , your highness . - Please . - man , I am so glad today is over with . - Ah , I hear ya . - Hey , orrin ? Womack ? - Pretend we didn 't hear him . - I know you heard me . - Hey ! Sergeant fredo ! - Oh , for cryin ' out loud . We only got half an hour left 'til the end of our shift . - Then you better get moving . - a peeper ! I don 't believe it ! - Believe it . Everyone else is on a homicide . Now get going . The lady sounded pretty upset . - Ahh . - Hi , boys- - Mm-Wah . - All right , we got everybody here . Line them all up , so I can ask questions in a minute . - cuff me , lady . I 'm all yours . - I don 't think that 'll be necessary , sir . - Where 's Walker ? - He 's at the bar . - Lieutenant , how long is this gonna take ? Is there some broad estimate you could give me ? I 'm trying to run a business . - and I 'm trying to run a murder investigation . Now you get the hell away from me- - now . You Brogan ? - Yeah , I 'm lieutenant Brogan . - Well , I 'm lieutenant Walker . What kept ya ? - I 'm officer haldane . It 's nice to meet you too . - Look , uh , I 'm sorry about your partner . - Oh , how sweet . And what a crock . - All righty , now that we 've gone through the introductions , why don 't you show us the crime scene ? - He 's really very clever , you know ? First , he traps her here . But then like an animal , he keeps moving , circling , stalking in a way . Then he kills her . - You know this guy ? - Oh , yeah . - You 've seen him ? - I 'll know when I do . It 's his third strike this week . All dancers . All in the club district . Same m.O. Exactly . - Yeah , we heard . - Sounds like it might be a serial killer . - Oh , nice work , Officer . Now you keep that up , one day you might even make lieutenant like us big boys ! - Uh , Jack you want to see what Jane and took are up to ? - Not really . - Do it anyway . So where the hell were you when you 're partner was being murdered ? - Obviously , I didn 't get here in time , okay ? - Uh-huh . - I was on the wrong side of the dance floor , okay ? I was out of position . Now look . Are you gonna assist me with this guy , or not ? - I 'm not assisting you in anything , lieutenant . This is my case . - the hell it is ! - Maybe you hadn 't noticed it , but this club 's in the 88th precinct . - Oh , oh , right . And we should 've cleared our operation with your people first . Is that it ? Look , Brogan . Sorry . Lieutenant Brogan . If you 're so hung up on procedure , join the army . I 'm lookin ' for a murderer here and now he 's a cop killer . Hold it . Sorry , kiddo . - Nice guy . - Chloe Vincent . Well , we were at police academy together . Same class . - Sorry , ladies . We 're closed . - Freeze ! It 's him ! - Ahhh ! - Get out of my way ! - Ahhh ! - Walker ! - Did you see him ? - What- - who ? - Damn ! - I-I don 't see no peeper . - Probably wishful thinkin ' on her part . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? - Thank goodness you 're here . - Uh , you , uh , reported a voyeur miss- - - Mrs. Kroze . My husband 's out of town . - All right . Come on out . - Now you wouldn 't want us to come in there after ya , would ya ? - I guess he would . - Ugh . Ugh . - I 'll hold the light . - Yeah , what a guy . - oh ! - What is that ? - I think it 's love . Oh ! - He says he sees the killer at the taunt . But before I can catch him , the so-Called suspect disappears into thin air . Captain , Walker 's a loose Cannon . - You were there , too ? Did you see anything ? - Just a jerk masquerading as a police , lieutenant , sir . - haldane ! The man just lost his partner ! What 's your excuse ? - Let 's put it this way , if there was a suspect in the club , I didn 't see him . - Yeah , well I did . And if you people would do you job , like checking the security recordings of the taunt , then you 'd see him too . - Well , as a matter of fact , lieutenant , our r.S.A. Unit is reviewing the recordings right now . - Yeah , so is there anything else you want to tell us about how to do out job ? - All right ! That 's enough ! You 're all professionals , act like it ! Now lieutenant , your captain tells me I can expect your full cooperation . - Yeah . - So what have you got ? - a possible lead . I 've set a meeting for tomorrow . - Captain , we 've got the autopsy report on Chloe Vincent . You 're gonna love this . Cause of death . None found . - Cause of death , none found . - I told you . It 's exactly like the other two . - Carson , how can that be ? - Well , sometimes it happens in elderly couples . One dies . A little later the other one goes too . No heart attack . No respiratory failure . No internal bleeding . They just lose the will to live . - So what are you telling me ? Lieutenant Walker 's partner lost her will to live ? - I can believe that . - go home , gentleman . Get a good night 's rest . Tomorrow will be here soon enough . - I can hardly wait . - Demeter shuttle arriving at 2600 hours . - It 's nice to see that I am not the only one around there who puts in long hours . - Whatever makes you feel good , slomo . - It was not a feeling . Just an observation . Officer castle , here is your hard copy of the bio you requested . Lieutenant verro Walker . - Thanks , slomo . - Later . - Lieutenant Walker worked at the 79th for ten years . Five years in homicide . Took a compulsory leave of absence last year for stress . - Stress ? Well maybe that explains it . Walker 's mind was really muddled when I read him at the club . Like a book where the letters kept changing . There was nothing you could 've done about Chloe . - I know . That 's the problem . - Hey- - Can you guys give me a ride home ? - When are you gonna get that burned out bucket of yours repaired ? - Why , to give up the pleasure of your company ? - Come on . - Chloe Vincent , an office from the 79th Precinct was killed earlier tonight at the taunt . The new downtown hot spot . Late night news has learned that the circumstances surrounding officer Vincent 's death were strikingly similar to those of last week 's victims . Leaving little doubt that a serial killer is at large in demeter city . - Swell . Hi , I didn 't hear you come in . - Ahh . You 're up late . - Ah , I couldn 't sleep . Hungry ? - Nah , I 'll get something . - Did you know Chloe Vincent ? - She was a classmate of Jane 's . Be back in a minute . - Sorry , fellas . Wish I could help , but you know the rules . All undocumented animals are destroyed . We just don 't have the facilities . - Thanks a lot , pal . - I told you Womack . There 's nothin ' we can do . - Come on , orrin . Where 's your sense of humanity ? - Hey ! What the- - will you give me that ? Come on ! Give me that ! Hey ! Come on . Come on . Yeah . That 's it . Come on . All right . All right . Hey , thanks . Well , if we can 't take him someplace to have him put down , what are we gonna do with him ? Yeah , I know- - I know . - Patrick ? Is that you ? No ! No ! - Honey ? - Oh , wow ! That was a bad one . - Nightmare ? - Mmm-hmm . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . Your mother just had a bad dream . - Cool . What about ? - Never mind . Go back to bed . - What was that all about ? - Mom had a nightmare . - Really ? What about ? - Never mind . Go back to bed . - Oh . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . Oh , he was so close . He was touching me . - Who was ? - I don 't know . Someone . Something . It was awful . Somehow I had the feeling it 's that guy who 's been killing all those women . Oh . - So Walker did see someone . - Slomo ? - I have cross linked with interplanetary . Species unidentified . No matches found . - Broaden the search parameters . - Yes , try everything . On world . Off world . The last 100 years . The last 200 years . Whatever . - Oh , uh , mmm , no . - Sorry , slomo . I just want to get this guy , you know ? - Match found . - What ? - Your request was to scan all files within the last 200 years . Match from 98 years ago . - Ninety-eight years ? - You 're kidding ! Let me see the file ! - Ersweelan . Hair covered biped from MELA star system . Non-Sentient . Odd . - Come on , slomo . We haven 't got all day . - Okay . Visual print scan queue lock . Now on screen . - Not him ! The guy from 98 years ago . - That is him . There is no mistake . - String of mysterious homicides . All nearly a 100 years ago . All victims young women . Suspect never apprehended . Last name : Kmada . First name : Enil . - Enil kmada ? - You 've heard of him ? - Yeah , macke . - What are you talking about ? - Anyone who was brought up in our star system has heard of kmada . He 's an urban legend . The kind of , you know , like a boogey man . My sister used to threaten me with horrible stories about him . - Yes , But the boogey man doesn 't exist . This guy 's for real . - Then kmada 's back . - So are you gonna tell us who we 're meeting , or is this just gonna be your little secret ? - She 's an informant . Maybe you 've heard about ' em . They give the police information , which helps with criminal case ? - Really ? - And maybe you 've heard about professional conduct . - Hey , you guys want to knock it off ? I 'm trying to land this thing in pea soup . Hey . - Lieutenant Walker ! - ' Kay , let me handle this . I 'm Walker . You mags serpell ? - Uh-huh . - You got something for us ? - Okay . I 'm a club girl . Damocles , otras , the hot tub , the taunt . I work ' em all . - Yeah , I-I get the picture . What 's your point ? - Your guy . The one you 're lookin ' for ? I 've seen him . Even talked to him . - Oh , yeah ? What 'd he say . - Oh , you know . Stuff . Things you 'd like to know . - Okay . What do you want ? - Well I figure since I 'm here doin ' somethin ' nice for you , maybe you should do somethin nice for me first , okay ? - No , no . No , you play , then we pay . - What 'd he look like ? - Uh , it was dark . You know ? I didn 't really get a good look at him . - Let 's go . - that 's great , Walker . Got anymore dynamite leads . - Lieutenant- - Wait ! Listen . Uh , I 'm kinda strapped . You couldn 't spot me a couple of credits , could you ? I 'd make it worth your while . - Get outta here . Oh . - Brogan ? We 've come up with the positive I.D. On the killer . - Well at least somethin ' goin ' right today . What do you got , castle ? - Change your mind , lieutenant ? Ahh ! - Brogan ! It 's him ! It 's our guy ! - Where ? ! - I lost him ! - I 'm checkin ' this way . Freeze ! - She 's dead . - Brogan he 's disappeared . Hold your position . I 'm on my way . Walker you- - Walker ! Walker ! Damn it ! Haldane , stay put ! Officer needs assistance . Fourteen twenty jupiter wharf . It 's a scrap metal yard . Haldane ? Haldane ? - Right here . So where 's Mr. Personality . - Ya got me . Walker ? Walker , what 's your position . - Uh , I don 't know . I 'm next to some kind of tower . Oh . I 'd tell ya This guy is giving me some kind of headache . - All right- - You stay put . We 'll come to you . Walker ! - There 's the tower he was talkin ' about . - Walker ! Where the he- - - What the hell 's goin ' on ? - He 's gone . - It 's weird . We go to meet Walker 's informant and kmada shows up ? - Yeah , maybe she knew more than we thought . - Brogan , she didn 't know squat . - All the same . She 's dead . - Nobody set eyes on enil kmada for almost a century . At first we thought we were dealing with a copycat killer , but according to Carson it 's the same guy . Or an exact clone . - Kmada 's back ? Is this a joke ? - No , this is no joke , pal . He 's for real . - Officer took is currently researching additional information regarding kmada 's origins . - Oh , I love this job . - I 'm sorry , uh , we 're closed . Oh , all right ! We 're open . - Well , the one thing we do know is that all four of the victims were killed in the club area , so we shall concentrate our efforts there . Now , there are 11 clubs situated along the east end of parallel road . The 79th Precinct will handle the shaded area , and the 88th will take all the rest . Lieutenants Walker and Brogan will coordinate the operation from the taunt . Sergeant ? - All right , folks . Here are your assignments . Orrin and Womack , the hot tub . Testook and manrovia , the damocles . Kovina and simian , otras . - What about our furry friend ? - He 'll be fine . Relax- - Nobody ever goes in that storage room . - Oh , did you find him anything to eat ? - Yeah , your dinner . - What ? - It doesn 't matter what your machines say , Officer . It can 't be him . - humor me , Mr. Perry . - All right . Ah . Ah . So let 's see . Kmada , kmada . Ah , here we are . Let 's see now . " and so it came to be , " that the souls of the macke we 're lost . " and they were condemned to live out their lives " in the bodies of others . " - You 're losing me , Mr. Perry . Are you saying that a macke lives Inside someone else ? - Precisely . It needs , uh , uh , a host . It sort of hibernates in them without their knowledge . - And eventually it kills the host , right ? - Uh , no . No . The-the host is the only one it can 't kill . It needs a host to stay alive . - So why does it have to kill at all ? - Uh , macke needs life force to sustain it . When its supply runs out , it awakens to feed , to-to kill . And it carries on killing until it has taken on enough life force to resume its hibernation . Of course , you know This is all , uh , purely academic . It says here that every host was wiped out during the " great purge . " They loaded them all on a ship and-And fired it into the suns . That was nearly a century ago . - Yeah , well they missed one . Look at it , Mr. Perry . It 's kmada . I know it and you know it . - Officer , there are no more macke . - Tell that to the four girls he 's killed in the last week . - So how 's life in the fast Lane , haldane ? - No sign of our boy , Brogan , but this place is jumpin ' . - How 's Jane bearing ' up ? She 's fine . I 'm watchin ' her every move . - I 'll bet you are . - What else ? - Uh , when a macke leaves to feed , it 's host experiences extreme pain . But it must stay close to its host at all times . Even when feeding . The macke and it 's host were to be inextricably intertwined for life . Like two beings with one soul . - Two beings ? Oh , great sempter . When I read Walker 's mind at the taunt . - Officer ! There 's more ! - Keep your mind on your work , Officer . The night isn 't over yet . - Stay out of my face , Walker . I know my job . - That was so degrading . Don 't say anything . I know where you live . - look , I was just gonna say that I appreciate what you 're doing . - anyone of us would do the same thing if ... you 're shoes . - You 're welcome to ' em . I don 't understand how they can do it . - What have I done ? - Yeah- - Brogan ? - Brogan , where is Walker ? - at the bar . - You got to get him out of there . - Whoa , slow down , took . - there isn 't time to explain . You got to trust me . Kmada lives inside Walker . - What ? - Kmada ! Hold it right there ! - Ah , ah , ah ! - Police ! Get down ! - No ! - Don 't move ! - Give it up , kmada ! - Ahh ! - Well , come on . You know what you have to do . Shoot me . - Walker , you don 't want me to do that . - Well you never have a better excuse . Come on , damn it ! Shoot ! Walker , I can 't ! - Don 't Walker ! - No ! - Hang in there , pal . Get away ! Give him some air ! - This is haldane ! We 've got an OFFICER down at the taunt . Send medical assistance . - I got him . - He never got out of the ambulance . I was with him the whole time . - What about kmada ? - I don 't know . He must have died inside Walker . - All right , lieutenant . Go home . You can file your report in the morning . - Thanks , captain . It 's been a long night . - So if Walker dies , kmada dies too ? - He needs Walker in order to survive . - don 't tell us , haldane . You need a ride home . - Walker didn 't make it . Brogan was with him in the ambulance when he died . - poor man . - Officer took , call on com nine . - ahh ! - Mr. Perry ! - Officer , I-I 'm glad I found you . I couldn 't remember if it was the 84th or the 48th , or the- - - Yeah , well , you found me . What 's in your mind ? - Kmada . I was trying to tell you when you left . When a macke 's host dies , it doesn 't guarantee that the macke dies , too . - Well , what are you saying ? - Macke can only survive without a host for a few seconds . So if it senses that its host is dying , it immediately finds a new one . If there is anyone nearby . - the hunt for the serial killer has ended today in the death of both the killer , and unfortunately , another policeman from the 79th precinct . Lieutenant verro Walker . No further details are available at this time . - This is getting to be a habit . - Hi . - Hi . You okay ? I just heard . - I 've been better . - Are you hungry ? - Uh , yeah . I guess I am . - Let me- - - It 's okay . I 'll-I 'll find something . - Brogan ! You gotta get out of there ! Get away from your family ! Kmada is not dead ! He 's with you now , Brogan . - Haldane ? - Just get out of there now ! And he 's got to go with you ! - Patrick ? - Come on ! Whatever the hell you are ! Come on ! Get back in there ! Ohh ! Clear everyone out of level one . Have slomo meet me at the docking bay airlock . - I don 't like this , Brogan . - that 's an order , haldane . I 'm gonna get this monster one way or another . - Lieutenant Brogan , you requested that I meet you here . - that 's right , slomo . I want you to discharge your auxiliary power packs into my arm . - Your request is in breach of safety regulations . I require authorization . - I 'm a lieutenant , slomo . I authorize it . - Duly logged , lieutenant Brogan . I 'm obliged to advise you that such a charge may prove fatal to humans . - Just do it ! - Yes , sir . Ready ? - Do it ! Oh ! No ! - I 'll rescue in three seconds . One one thousand . Two one thousand . Go ! - Slomo , scan your neural net for any new data . - I am detecting an anomalous program in my primary I.O. Sector . Correction . The program is now relocating . - delete it , slomo ! Delete it now ! - No , no , uh , uh , no . Program deleted . - Come on ! - Clear ! - Nothing . - Clear . - Nothing ! - Clear . - Yes ! - Brogan . Come on ! Come on ! - did I , uh ... did I mention that I love this job ? - I checked with the 79th and apparently about a month ago , Walker tried to prevent the suicide of a deep sea Sander , who was accused of murdering the rest of the crew . Well , that would explain how kmada got into Walker 's body in the first place . Call me stupid , but- - - Ooh , don 't tempt me . - I still don 't exactly get how this whole slomo thing worked . - Well , slomo 's neural net mimics a living organism , right ? - Right . - So when Brogan died , kmada needed another host . Slomo was the only one available . - Kind of like hit the delete button , and Bye-Bye bad guy . - Yeah . - Hmm , a delete button . - Not gonna work on me . I 'm hittin ' escape . Later , guys . - Hey , haldane ? Don 't you need a ride ? - No . Got that bucket of bolts of mine gleaming ' again . - Listen , Jack . Um- - - Oh , come on . Don 't tell me you two are all spooked by This kmada thing . - I didn 't say that . - Okay . Well , if you two are comin ' , Let 's go . - I bet the little guy is as happy as a slatworm in milk . - Officer orrin and Womack ? My office . Now ! - Did he say , " Please ? " - Uh-Uh . - Not good . - Cap , uh ... - captain I , uh , Womack ? - What the hell is that , sir ? - You mean you 've never seen this animal before ? - Uh , no sir . Not us . - Ah , now that is a biggie . This is dr . Greeves of the endangered species facility . - How ya doin ' ? - That ersweelan is the last of his kind . And the doctor was planning to give a substantial reward for his return . - Oh . - Ah , well . I suppose he 'll just have to donate it to the , uh , retired officer 's fund instead , eh ? - Ah ! Get off me ! - Ah , I hope that 's the last time you decide to bring your work home with you . Count on it . He 's gone for good . - I don 't know . I 'm afraid he might come back in my dreams . - Well , I-I can 't guarantee you won 't have nightmares again . - Well , then I guess you 'll just have to figure out a way to keep me awake .

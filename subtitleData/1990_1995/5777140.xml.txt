 Company , by the right . Eyes right . Eyes front . I said , eyes front . You have come here because society has no use for you . The prisons have given up hope of rehabilitating you .

I want to see prisoner 2675 . 201 1 , Benghazi , Libya . You marched up to your commanding officer and shot him . You were convicted of first-degree , premeditated homicide .

I run a multinational business here . I re-process human garbage from around the world . I 'm good at it because I make all the rules . You will have no contact with the world . No visitors , no letters . You 're dead . But if you break any of my rules , you 'II find a life after death . A very painful life . Have you anything to add ? Don 't ever turn your back on me again . Come on . Thanks . It 's for you . Come on . Quick , quick . Don 't eat it yet , they 'II find out . They know everything . Our electrical impulses betray us . The ones in the brain . They 've got computers in the walls . They know what we 're thinking . Don 't think . - They 're coming for me . They know . - What ? - They 're coming for me . - It 's not you . - They 're coming to get me . - relax . They want you to think that . They 'II be back . Where are they taking him ? - AbsoIom . - Where ? AbsoIom . The killers are kings . Their teeth are like knives . Human flesh is tough . They fly from the trees ... Ssh , ssh . Hoarding food is a major infraction . You are given enough to survive . No more no less . The punishment for this infraction : Ten lashes . Prisoner 2675 . You will execute the punishment . Nine more , please . Begin . Pick it up . In five seconds , he 's dead . You don 't know me well enough to doubt me . Now pick it up . One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... Five ... Good . Now , begin .

Isn 't this beautiful ? 200 deluxe rooms . A heated pool and a staff of caring professionals . I 'm sorry , I 'm being rude . I 'm waiter Marek , the manager . welcome to vacation paradise . - I hope you take plastic . - We take everything . I 've scheduled a variety of stimulating activities for you . - ShuffIeboard ? - Water sports . These activities can be rigorous , so we 're selective about our clientele . We like to make sure they meet the physical demands . To get your heart pounding , we thought : Five minutes in the pool with ralph , our director of aquatic activities . Enjoy . That 's extraordinary . It wasn 't what we had in mind , but ... Extraordinary ! I can use a man like you on my staff . We appear to have an opening . Think about it . deluxe rooms , free meals : Anyone you can catch , kill and eat . - How 's your health plan ? - Average life expectancy is ... Six months ? I 've been here seven years . - What if I say no ? - That would be very disappointing . If you 've got to go , I won 't stand in your way . - I couId probably use the exercise . - I 'II stay . I 'II stay . If you promise to hire another lifeguard . You want it ? You want it ? Get out of the way ! That was a very silly thing to do . Let him go . Bye ! - Yes ? - A message from the island . Prisoner 2675 is alive . He 's at the insiders ' camp . You don 't ever go in there . Ever ! - How are you feeling ? - Okay . - Do you want to sit down ? - No . - What 's your name ? - Robbins . Mr Hawkins is our security chief . I 'm known as the Father here . How did you escape the Outsiders ? - Why ? - How did you get past the traps ? - What is this place ? - A sanctuary , Mr Robbins . Most of us came before the Outsiders got so strong . You 're the first to ever escape from Marek . And you brought a very powerful weapon . - What about that ? - It 's been appropriated . How did you get it ? I was shot , beaten , haIf-drowned . I don 't want an interrogation . - It 's not an interrogation . - Then you do the talking . We 've created a new , civilised society here . We 're alone on this island . We have what other prisoners want : Freedom . The chance to make a life . You are a highly resourceful man . Join us . I 'm not a joiner anymore . I just want to get off this island . Take him to Dysart . Severe oxidation of the firing module . Transducers require an overhaul . CoiI , ejector rods , targeting ... AII completely shot . The coil can be insulated with silk . Even flax from a corn stalk . And the ejector rods just need sanding . - You know your weapons , Mr ... - Robbins . The new man . - How did you get it ? - I slept with the owner . - Did you hear that ? - He 's determined to escape . Yes , of course . You 're on an island , Mr Robbins . It 's called AbsoIom , situated 200 miles from the mainland . There 's no guards , no cells . We 're on a peninsula . Beyond those trees is the ocean . The jungle side is heavily defended . You know why . The Outsiders . We think there are about 600 . There are precisely 98 of us . The island is watched by satellites with infra-red scanners . Any escape will be detected . There 's a fleet of helicopters 50 miles away . They can be here in minutes . - And you call this freedom ? - Under the circumstances . We use the term loosely . I 'm sorry , but you 're here for the rest of your life . You can 't go anywhere with that leg . You 've time to think . You either stay here and do your share , or take your chances out there . Your feet ! Wipe your feet . The average male foot has over 600 million germs . Wow ! So we 're talking 1 .2 billion ? There 's nothing funny about sinus infections , bronchitis or pink eye . There 's no antibiotics here , no penicillin . A bad case of pink eye , and you 're history . Okay , I 'II remember that . - Who are you ? - Tom King . I host the newcomers . Everything you need is in that drawer . I suggest an oral hygiene programme . Trench mouth is rampant . Wash your face before shaving . A " staph " infection could kill . The Father sent over some salve for your leg . Nasty . - Why do they call him the Father ? - That 's what he is , to us . It must be the dust . - Why are you following me ? - You frightened me . - Why are you following me ? - I was just ... I heard you escaped from Marek . I wanted to meet the badass ... - Don 't . - Sure . Sorry . Hey , I understand . - What are you doing ? - Nothing . - Just leave me alone , okay ? - absolutely . Wet Dreams ! That 's what I call this place . Wet Dreams . I come here and think about home . Newark . It 's about 5,000 miles that way . I thought it was a slum but now I 'd kiss the gutters . - Then start swimming . - I 've got a problem with sharks . I 've got the same thing with rats . Wait . Stephano . My friend , Mr Robbins . Don 't touch him . This is Stephano . Anything you need , he 's got it . I Iike the boots . Sign them to me for merchandise . When you die , they 're mine . Okay ? He does that with everyone . What merchandise do you have ? I have two dozen potatoes , very few bruises . I 've five pairs of underwear . Size 44 . " Fruit of the Loom " . Okay ... I 've got 1 4 disposable razors . They 're pink , but who gives a shit , right ? Are you a ball player ? I 've got a first baseman 's mitt . Are you a righty ? - I 'm trying to do business ! - I found some rubber . I 'm overwhelmed . Here ... Take my sack ... Bring it up the cliff , and quit bothering me . I want this mitt . Come back . I must have something you want ! Have you got a boat ? A boat .. ? I Iove those boots . What are you doing ? No one goes out at night . - I don 't take orders anymore . - We 're all Iifers here . We have our own rules . You could have been an Outsider . You 're lucky I didn 't kill you . You think I 'm lucky ? Count your blessings . You know what I want . Don 't be shy with that . This is my absolute goddamn favourite . - Good , ain 't it ? - Yeah , if you Iike road kill . It 's not for everyone . - Why were you sent here , Casey ? - The Weinburger kidnapping . You did that ? I was a gopher . Drove the car , went for coffee , fed the kids . They were in a closet . I told the boss there was no air . But he had a million dollars on the brain . I wouldn 't have hurt them . I had a brother and sister their age . supply drop . - What ? - supply drop . For the Outsiders . - How often do they come ? - Twice a month . Forget about jumping that chopper . They pick a new spot each time . And who 'd fly it ? - Most of us can 't even read . - I can . - fly a chopper ? - No , read . Mr Robbins , it 's time I bought you a drink . - KiIIian ? Two shots of 1 2-day-oId . - Piss off ! Mr Robbins is new in town . Give us a little taste . Down the hatch . Brain spasm . It took me years to get that effect . - This stuff will kill you . - What ? - You call my Iife 's work shit ? - It 's turpentine . Bastard ! I can whip your ass with only one arm , you know . Anybody who can make nectar like this , I wouldn 't want to mess with . We 've got to go to the gate . Everyone must go to the gate . - What 's going on ? - He fell asleep at his post . He was warned . It 's the second time . The rules are there to protect the community . Any man who jeopardises the lives of any or all among us commits a capital offence . The penalty is banishment . You don 't approve ? - Do you need my approval ? - He broke the rules . And he 'II die because of the rules . Innocent people always do . They die for somebody else 's rules . We live under constant threat . That man could have cost us our lives . We must do this to survive . How long can you stay awake without somebody guarding you ? What 's the problem ? - Where 's the food ? - You 'II get it when I say . Tomorrow , if you behave . We 're sick of obeying you . Someone else should give the orders . really ? Do you have anyone in mind ? What about the con who stole the gun and gave you a bath ? Maybe we should ask him . That 's not funny . Now that 's funny ! - They 'II tear each other to pieces . - We 'II make a raid . That won 't work anymore . We need the land , the food , everything . - We 'II need the other gangs . - Maybe there 's another way . Maybe we should just make it personal . Just me and Dad . Robbins ! Merry Christmas ! I made you a hat . You don 't have to wear it . It 's a Christmas party , come on . Excuse me . Quiet please . will you be quiet ! Mr Dysart ... Here we go . Thank you . A lovely tree . You want to go carolling ? uncle Stephano has a present for one and all . These little suckers . These morsels of technology washed up here , and they 're as good as the day they were made . Let me demonstrate . gentlemen ... Come and get it ! Look ... For the Iong cold nights ahead . I won 't be needing it . But thank you . Turn it down . Another year has passed . The first , for some . For others , just one more . No path here is ever the same , but we all share something that cannot be taken away . We have proved to ourselves that we cannot be written off . That our lives mean something . We are not animals , we are human beings . That 's our reprieve . That 's our pardon . That 's our freedom . Merry Christmas , everyone . Now I have a toast . To all our victims . May they rest in peace . - So you 're leaving us ? - At daybreak . - How far do you think you 'II get ? - I 'II figure something out . I don 't have all the answers , but here there 's help . You can have purpose . You can even have friends . Most people would call that a life . - I don 't want a life with you . - What made you Iike this ? We 're all guilty in someone 's eyes , especially our own . eventually , you 'II have to forgive yourself , or you won 't survive . Good luck , Mr Robbins . - What 's going on ? - The Outsiders are going to attack . Let 's go , move it ! - What happened ? - Somebody tipped him off . It doesn 't matter , stick with the plan . - Mr Robbins ... - What do you want , Casey ? - Can you stand with me on the wall ? - Get out ... Get out ! - There was a signal ? - We have a spy in their camp . Robbins ... Do you believe there 's a God up there looking out for us ? There 's something up there , but it 's not God . Sir , a strike force are at the village perimeter . What the hell are they waiting for ? Down ! It 's started . - Any thermal activity ? - Nothing that a satellite can see . - You 're sure ? - It 'II take more heat than that . - Choppers on alert , sir ? - No . Let them fight it out . Water ! Water ! There you go , guys ... Excuse me ... Get him out of here . I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year . It 's been a Iong time , Dad . You 've done well for yourself . I 'm very impressed . Really nice place you have here . Just a stone 's throw from the ocean . Mind you , with the price of real estate , you are very lucky . I mean , this is a prime site . I got to tell you , your security sucks . Look at this ! This is great . I really get behind on my reading . I never seem to have enough time . I 've always wanted to read this : " Basket Weaving . A Creative Choice . " Now I 'm going to kill you . If I 'd known you were here , I would have knocked . Ratman ! Shit ... - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Thanks a Iot . I don 't know what happened . - I had him in my sights ... - It 's okay . They do this several times a year to steal our food . - He was coming for you . - Maybe Marek 's losing patience . If he ever gets organised , he 'II bury you and this place . That 's our problem , not yours , Mr Robbins . Isn 't it ? He 's military trained . Not just as a soldier . Navy SEAL , special Forces , take your pick . Somebody taught him how to kill . The men we honour tonight fought bravely and died for us . And though they have given everything , we must not pity them . Their pain is gone . Now , at last , their souls are free . When we lack the fruits of their labours , we will miss them . Here . - Why did they let this happen ? - The warden wants us to fight . - Why ? - Because he can do as he pleases . You don 't understand . This place is secret , it 's private . The authorities keep it classified . No one knows it exists . If it leaked out , the public wouldn 't allow it . That 's why they make sure no one escapes . As my old catholic mother used to say : " alas , for our sins we shall pay . " - What sins is he paying for ? - Ask him yourself . He gave us our lives back . He was a surgeon . He still is a damn good one . He had lots of money and a young , beautiful wife . But she got bored and started sleeping around . That tore him up inside . One day she died of an overdose . He claimed it was suicide , but the jury didn 't believe him . They gave him life . - Do you think he did it ? - He 's the only innocent man here . You liar ! AII this crap about a new society . You 've been planning to escape . How much further , Mr Dysart ? It 's 2,000 metres . - Why don 't they stop it ? - It 's a special craft . It can evade their sensors . It has a cooling system . - They can 't see it ? - We don 't know yet . There 's a five-miIe surveillance circle . They haven 't crossed it yet . What have you got ? The warden 's dry cleaning . Main gate , open it up . 1 , 000 metres . - 500 metres . - It 's going to make it . Warden . Message from the island . Code seven . - It 's out . - It 's got to be ! Come on , move ! Are you all right ? - Maybe the cooling system failed . - That 's bullshit . They were tipped off . The warden 's planted someone . That 's why we 're so cautious . - You could have been a spy . - You 're in charge of security . - What the hell do you mean ? - They 're gone . - We can 't do anything . - Who were they ? You don 't know them . They were in the caves for months . Good men . - I want to be on the next boat . - Who do you think you are ? Those men worked hard for years . You ain 't done shit . He 's right . You haven 't earned it . Not yet . You don 't waste time , do you , Dysart ? The components are made here and then assembled in the cave . Is this the one you 'II be on ? No , Mr Robbins . I won 't be leaving . 30 years ago , I used my talents to make a very powerful bomb . For money . I didn 't believe in the cause , I just wanted the money . 50 people died . Now I 'm right where I belong . What 's this ? We 've been working on a power source . Power source , my ass ! This is a V8 . Yes , that 's right . From an old Chevy . theoretically , it can propel a craft through the surveillance circle . - unfortunately , it 's useless . - Why ? We 're missing a vital component . - It requires a device ... - A distributor . Yes , a simple , ordinary , garden-variety distributor . Found in any auto store in the world . The problem is , Mr Robbins , we 're not in the world . - I want to be on the next boat . - We 've discussed that . Your engine is missing something , right ? I 've seen what you 're looking for in Marek 's camp . - You 'II trade that for a space ? - along with Casey . He doesn 't belong here . You know there 's almost no chance of you returning alive . - That 's my problem . - There 's something you should know . - Those who escape get the word out . - And risk getting sent back ? We have a responsibility to blow this place wide open . The boat is the only way to get us all off . You 've heard my deal , no conditions . Take it or leave it . - So you 're going back to Marek 's ? - How the hell did you find out ? It 's a small town . You 've got balls , I 'II give you that . But the smart money says Marek will be playing jacks with them . No , you can 't have my shoes . Wait . I 'm shocked that you think that 's why I came . You need those shoes . You 'II be doing a Iot of running . A tough guy like you will probably get back wounded and die here . - You know what will happen ? - No . Everybody will be fighting over those shoes . - It will disrupt the whole village . - You want me to sign a contract ? - Just initial the page ... - Get out ! We 'II make it a verbal agreement . - I 'II find a witness . - Out ! I 've charted the safest route . follow the river to the falls . Then Marek 's camp is just east . An example of an older technology . Invented by Sergei MoIotov , long ago . The original instructions are : Light it and throw it . Great , thanks . Good luck . Mr Robbins ! - Casey ... - I want to come with you . - please take me . - Casey , go home . I can help you . I thought you were my friend ! Have you ever killed anyone , Casey ? I 'm going to have to kill . No hesitation , no conscience . After that , you 're never the same . - You 're lucky you can 't do it . - You won 't come back . Casey . Who 's the guy who went up against Marek and lived ? - You did . - That 's right . And I 'm going to do it again . You 're looking for a friend ? I 'm the best friend you ever had . Now go back . Go . Go . Sorry to keep you waiting . I 've been a little preoccupied . Now ... I think it 's about time we patched up our differences . If anyone disagrees with me , please raise your right hand . If you 've got one . No ? Good . Very good . As you see , I 've eliminated the heads of state . So from now on , we 'II all be nice and civilised . No more gangs , petty squabbles or fighting . I 've been under a Iot of stress . The reason for this is very simple : I really want to be in charge . Okay ? Good . No ! My ! You 're just a boy . A sweet , tender , adorable little boy . Tie him up . And I don 't want him bruised . And slowly , very slowly , they climbed up to the top of the stairs . Then the three bears found a boy sleeping in their bed . And they all said , " Who can this be ? " The little boy didn 't answer , so the big daddy bear ripped his arm off . You are so cute . You 're far too young to be out here on your own . Where are your other little friends ? will they come by ? Don 't be shy , tell uncle walter . Fuck you . Bonjour . Guten Tag . welcome . Same game as before , my friend . But this time with a little twist . You 'II love it . First prize is a chance to live . Second prize ... You really don 't want to know . Don 't disappoint us . We 've paid to see a show . If you refuse to fight , it 'II be boring , and then I 'II have to jump in and kill you both . Now ! Go on ! You have to kill me . I 'II never get out of here . You can save them . Do it ! No ... I 'm really trying to retain my faith in humanity , but you are making it very difficult . I welcomed you , I treated you with respect . I even offered you a position . And what did you do ? You made a horse 's ass out of me ! I hate it when that happens . What were you trying to do ? Were you trying to kill me ? You really thought you could kill me ? Shame about the boy . But nothing goes to waste here . I 'II have a dinner party and share him with my friends . You 're going to die very , very badly . Marek 's united all the gangs for an attack . You must warn them . I 'II signal when they march . Why are you doing this ? Redemption . Now , go ! Dysart ! One distributor . Make it work . The Father fell ill soon after you left . - The men are worried . - Marek 's going to attack . We must fortify the barrier and the towers , and dig a moat . What about some mantraps just outside the barrier ? We can fill the moat with fuel . Mr KiIIian can provide it . - I 'II double production right away . - And more weapons . tell your men we 'II need all the metal we can find . Mr Robbins ? We 're outnumbered six to one . Marek 's united all the gangs . If he wants this place , we can 't stop him . - If we stay here he 'II kill us all . - What are you saying ? - We abandon the village ? - I 'm just telling you the facts . He wants us to give up all that we 've worked for for 1 3 years . - I won 't do it without a fight . - He 's right . Why fool ourselves ? We 've always been about survival . Whatever it takes . It 's the only way . - Make preparations to leave . - What are you talking about ? Do it ! Mr Robbins ... Did Casey follow you ? What happened ? I 'm sorry . Dysart . - Is the boat ready ? - almost . - Finish it . - What for ? I 've been here for 1 3 years . From the beginning . I helped build this place with my sweat and my heart , and I 've watched a Iot of good men die defending it . And I saw , for the first time in my Iife , what a home could be . I can 't just walk out on it . I can 't just hand it over with nobody here to stop them . Who said no one 's going to be here ? - You said you were getting better . - That was a lie . I 'm dying . I have Hodgkin 's disease . It 's progressive . Without proper treatment , lethal . please ... - Does anyone else know ? - They 'II know soon enough . But for now , you 're the only one . I have a month left , maybe two . But before I go , there 's an important matter to be settled . - I want you to take my place . - What ? The men respect you . You 're a natural leader . No . - Then they don 't stand a chance . - That 's not my problem . It has to be you . I didn 't risk my Iife with Marek to stay here . - I have to get off this island . - No one tells you what to do ? You were a soldier . You must have fought for something . Look ... I 'II take care of Marek . For my own reasons . - After that , I 'm gone . - Why ? You can 't change your past . That 's easy for you to say , isn 't it ? - You have no blood on your hands . - What makes you so sure ? I know what they think . It doesn 't matter . My wife 's death was no suicide . If you go , take my journal . It tells the truth about this place . Give it to someone who will save these people . Let 's give it a try . Mr Robbins ? Mr Robbins . I led a helicopter assault on a village . It was supposed to be the source of bio-weapons fire . I should have known better . I had a Iot of combat time , so I should have known . It was too easy . There was no radar , no air defence . I kept telling him , but he ordered us in anyway . And God help me , I always followed orders . I vaporised the place . 342 women and children . And they covered it up . We were losing the war . They needed a big body count . So they gave me a medal for the victory . Even after I 'd killed him , no one would listen to me . No one wanted to hear the truth . And that 's why I have to get back . The real story is buried with those women and children . I have to tell somebody what really happened . Because I can 't live with it alone anymore . So let the truth come out . AII of it . Attack ! - Another raid ? - No , a major attack . - What about thermal activity ? - None so far . Son of a bitch . Marek ! You want it ? Come and get it . - What 's that ? - The sensors are overloaded . Somebody will read that . Get me a chopper and a fuIIy-armed riot platoon . I 've got him . I don 't envy you , going back to a destructive world . Six choppers standing by . ECD , 1 2 minutes . I 'm not waiting . tell them to follow . Tonight we 'II bury the Father . Tomorrow , we 'II start rebuilding the compound . Tomorrow , we start all over again . No ! Where is it ? Is this how you tell him what he wants to know ? - Why ? - He promised to let me go . - He promised me freedom . - I 've got a promise for you . You 'II help with the next boat , or I 'II kill you ! - He 's coming . - What ? The warden . He 's coming straight away . What are the coordinates ? Where will he land ? - King , where ? - The lower field , past the river . That 's no good . tell him he needs new coordinates . - Right ? - Yes . Sir ? We have a transmission , code seven . Yes ? The landing zone has a problem . - What do you mean ? - The Outsiders ... They 're retreating through that area . Let 's go , we don 't have much time . Listen , the Father ... You talked to him before ... What did he say ? He wanted me to go to the authorities . And he told me he wanted you to take his place . I 'II blow this place wide open . You have my word on that . Pick him up . - The gunships are almost here . - Pick him up ! Lift off . Goddamn it , lift off ! One ... two ... three ... - Four ... five . - please ! Come on . No ! We 've got to go . We 've got to go ! No ... - We 'II wait here for the choppers . - No . We can 't stay here . We 've got to hide .

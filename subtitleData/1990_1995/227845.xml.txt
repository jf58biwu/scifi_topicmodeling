 3 billion human lives ended on August 29th , 1 997 . The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day . They lived only to face a new nightmare , the war against the machines . The computer which controlled the machines , Skynet , sent two terminators back through time . Their mission : to destroy the leader of the human resistance : John Connor . My son . The first terminator was programmed to strike at me . in the year 1 984 . before John was born . It failed . The second was set to strike at John himself , when he was still a child . As before , the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior . A protector for John . It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first . I need your clothes. your boots . and your motorcycle . You forgot to say ' please ' . Take it . You can 't leave and take the man 's wheeIs. son . Now get off before I put you down . That 's it , goddammit ! Art 31 David show me code 6 at the 6th street bridge in Santa FÃ© on an electrical disturbance . 1 0-4 . 31 David . John ! Get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours . Your foster-parents are kinda dicks , huh ? I swear I 've had it with that goddamn kid . Won 't even answer me anymore . - Honey. move ! would you get off your butt and help me ? Todd . - What ? He hasn 't cleaned that room of his in a month . Oh. it 's an emergency . Hang on , I 'll get right on it . John ! Come on get your ass inside , do what your mother tells you ! She 's not my mother . Todd ! This next patient is interesting . Been following the case for years . 29-year-oId female ... ... diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder . Depression. anxiety , violent acting-out. delusions of persecution . The delusional architecture is fairly unique . She believes in a machine called a " terminator " , which looks human of course. was sent back through time to kill her . That 's original ! And also that the father of her child was a soldier . sent back to protect her . - No . He was from the future too . The year 2029 . if I remember correctly . Here we are . Morning . Sarah . Good morning . Dr. Silberman . How 's the knee ? Fine , Sarah . She stabbed me in the kneecap with my pen a few weeks ago . Repeated escape attempts . Let 's move on , shall we ? I don 't like to see the patients disrupting their rooms . See that she takes her Thorazine . - l 'll take care of it . Time to take you meds , Connor . You take it . You gotta be good . You 're up for review this afternoon . I 'm not taking it . I don 't want any trouble . - Ain 't no trouble ... Yeah , zap her . Last call , sugar . Sweet dreams . Are you the legal guardian of John Connor ? That 's right . What 's he done now ? could I speak with him , please ? could if he was here . He took off on his bike . So he could be anywhere . Do you have a photo of John ? Yeah , sure. hold on . You gonna tell me what this is about ? I just need to ask him a few questions . He 's a good looking boy . Mind if I keep this picture ? - No. go on . There was a guy here looking for him too . Big guy on a bike . Has that got something to do with this ? No. I wouldn 't worry about him . Thanks for your cooperation . please insert your stolen card now ! PIN number ... Hurry up , this is taking too long ! Go baby , go baby ... alright ! pin number ... Who did you learn this from ? - My mom . My real mom , I mean . Withdraw 300 bucks . Come on , baby. come on ... It worked ! Easy money ! Come on ! Yeah ! - Piece of cake ! That her ? Yes . So she 's pretty cooI. huh ? - No. she 's a complete psycho . That 's why she 's up at Pescadero , the mental institute . Tried to blow up the computer factory , but got shot and arrested . - Oh shit . She 's a total loser . Come on , Iet 's go spend some money ! Sarah . Sarah. wake up . kyle ? You 're dead . Where 's our son , Sarah ? They took him away from me . He 's the target now . - l know ! He 's alone . You have to protect him . I know . You tell me how I am supposed to do that . He doesn 't even believe me anymore . I 've lost him . You 're strong . Sarah . Stronger than you ever thought . - No . On your feet , soldier ! I Iove you . I always will . I need you . - l 'll always be with you . Remember the message ? " The future is not set . There is no fate but what we make for ourselves . " Stay with me . There 's not much time left in the world . Sarah . kyle , don 't go ! kyle ! It 's like a giant strobe light , burning right to my eyes . Somehow I can still see . Look , we know the dream 's the same every night. why do we have to ... please continue . The children look like burnt paper . black . not moving . Then the blast wave hits them and they fly apart like leaves . Dreams about the end of the world are very common . Sarah . It 's not a dream. you moron . It 's real . I know the date it happens ! - l 'm sure it feels real to you . On August 29th . 1 99 7 it 's going to feel pretty fucking real to you too ! Anybody not wearing two million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day , get it ? God , you think you 're safe and alive . You 're already dead . Everybody . him. you. you 're dead already ! This place , everything you see. is gone . You 're the one living in a fucking dream . SiIberman ! Because I know it happens . It happens ! I feel much better now . clearer . Yes . Your attitude has been much improved lately . It has helped to have a goal , something to look forward to . And what is that ? You said that if I showed improvement after six months , you would transfer me to the minimum security wing and I could have visitors . Well , it 's been six months . I was looking forward to seeing my son . I see . Let 's go back to what you were saying about those terminator machines . Now you think they don 't exist ? They don 't exist . I know that now . But you 've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press . If I had , there would have been some evidence . They would 've found something at the factory . I see . So you don 't believe anymore that the company covered it up ? No , why would they ? Let 's try a new position . Right. there . The neuronal sensors are correct , because it works . The neurons are all centered . Maybe the inhibitors failed . Mr. Dyson ? The materials team ... ... is running another series this afternoon. and you have to ... You have to sign it out . Come on. I 'll get it . I know I haven 't been here that long , but I was wondering if you know ... Know what ? Well if you know , where it came from . I asked the same question once . Know what they told me ? " Don 't ask . " Hello . Mr. Dyson . - How 's it going ? - Okay . Insert key . Left and three , two. one , turn . How are wife and kids ? - Great , thanks . So what do you think , Doctor ? I 've shown improvement . haven 't I ? Well , Sarah , here 's the problem : I know how smart you are . You 're just telling me what I want to hear . I don 't think you believe what you 're telling me . If I put you in minimum security you 'II just try to escape again . You have to let me see my son . please . please . He 's in great danger . He 's naked without me . If I couId just make a phone call . - l 'm afraid not . Not for a while . I don 't see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here for another six months . You son of a bitch ! You don 't know what you 're doing ! - Straighten her now ! You don 't know what you 're doing ! model citizen . You just missed him . He left fifteen minutes ago . I think he said he was going to the galleria . - Yeah . The Galleria ? I 'II get some quarters . I 'II be back. alright ? GirIs. do you know John Connor ? - No . You know this guy ? No , I don 't know him . John . - Not now . There 's this cop scoping for you . check it out . Split , man. just go . - Yeah . I think I saw the kid you 're looking for . You 're not supposed to be here ! Get down ! Come on ! Goddamn ! Okay. time out . Stop the bike ! Come on , stop the bike . Don 't take this the wrong way . you 're a terminator. right ? Yes . Cyberdyne Systems , Model 1 01 . Holy shit ! You 're really real ! You 're like a machine underneath . but sort of alive outside ? I 'm a cybernetic organism . Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton . This is intense . Get a grip . John . You 're not here to kill me . I figured that out for myself . So what 's the deal ? My mission is to protect you . Yeah ? Who sent you ? You did . 35 years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here . in this time . This is deep . This other guy . he 's a terminator like you , right ? Not like me . A T-1 000 . Advanced prototype . You mean more advanced than you are ? Yes . A mimetic poIyalloy . What does that mean ? Liquid metal . Where are we going ? - We have to get out of the city . And avoid the authorities . I gotta stop by my house and pick up some stuff . - Negative . The T-1 000 will definitely try to reacquire you there . You sure ? - l would . Look , Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them . Shit ! You got a quarter ? Hello ? Janelle ? It 's me . John ? - Yeah . Is everything alright ? - Sure . Are you alright ? - l 'm fine . John , it 's late. I was beginning to worry about you . If you hurry. we can have dinner together . I 'm making beef stew . Something 's wrong . She 's never this nice . Where are you ? What 's the goddamn dog barking at ? Shut up . you piece of shit ! The dog 's barking . tell the kid to get rid of that mutt . Honey , it 's late . could it already be there ? Are you okay ? I 'm right here . I 'm fine . - Are you sure ? What 's the dog 's name ? - Max . Janelle. what 's wrong with WoIfy ? I can hear him barking . Is he okay ? Wolfy 's fine , honey . Where are you ? Your foster-parents are dead . I need a minute here . You 're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches ? Anything it samples by physical contact . Can 't be real ! It could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes ? only objects of equal size . Why not a bomb or something to get me ? It can 't form complex machines . Guns , explosives have chemicals . moving parts . It doesn 't work that way . But it can form solid metal shapes . Like what ? - Knives and stabbing weapons . These were taken by a video surveillance camera at the West highland police station in 1 984 . He killed 1 7 police officers that night . Men with families . Children . These were taken at a mail in Reseda . Today . Ms Connor. we know you know who this guy is . Look , I just sat here and told you your son is missing , that the foster-parents have been murdered . We know this guy 's involved . Doesn 't that mean anything to you ? Don 't you care ? We 're wasting our time . Let 's go . Sorry , guys . She 's just grown more and more disconnected from reality as time goes on . I 'm afraid she can 't help us now . If she clears at all and can give us anything , I 'll call you . - Sure . Douglas. take her back to her room. please . - Yes. sir . Come on , let 's go . We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that . For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy . running guns . Then there were some other guys . She 'd shack up with anybody she could learn from . so she could teach me how to be this great military leader . Then she gets busted and it 's like : " Sorry kid. your mom 's a psycho . Didn 't you know ? " Everything I 've been brought up to believe is all bullshit . I hated her for that . But everything she said was true . She knew . And nobody believed her . Not even me . We gotta get her out of there . - Negative . The T-1 000 's highest probability for success will be to copy her and wait for you to make contact . Great . What happens to her ? The subject being copied is terminated . Why didn 't you tell me ? We gotta go now ! Negative . It 's not a priority . Fuck you . she 's a priority to me ! Goddammit ! What 's your problem ? Help ! - This does not help our mission ! Help me ! Get this psycho off of me . Let me go ! Why did you do that ? Because you told me to . What ? You have to do what I say ? One of my mission parameters . Prove it . Stand on one foot . cool ! My own terminator . You okay. kid ? Take a hike. bozo . Let 's get out of here . - What ? Fuck you . little dipshit . Dipshit ? Put your leg down . Did you call moi a dipshit ? Just trying to help this punk . Grab this guy . Now who 's the dipshit . you jock douchebag ? Put the gun down ! Now ! Get out of here ! Come on , let 's split ! You were gonna kill that guy ! Of course. I 'm a terminator . Listen to me carefuIIy. okay ? You 're not a terminator anymore . alright ? You got that ? You just can 't go round killing people ! - Why ? What do you mean " why " ? 'Cause you can 't ! Why ? - Because you just can 't. okay ? Trust me on this . Look , I 'm gonna go get my mom . And I order you to help me . You have a Sarah Connor here ? - You 're running kind of late . They 've been in there for an hour . Hold on a second , I 'll buzz you in . Oh. here come your friends now . Hey Gwen. you want some coffee ? - No. thanks . How about a beer ? - Yeah. right . I got a Full House . - That 's good . Must be my lucky day . Yeah , I think you 're right about number 24 . Increase the medication to 250 milligrams . Same time ? - Yeah . You broke my arm ! There 's 21 5 bones in the human body . That 's one . Now don 't move ! What are you gonna do ? Why do we stop now ? You gotta promise you 're not gonna kill anyone. right ? Right . - Swear . What ? Just put up your hand and say " I swear I won 't kill anyone . " I swear I will not kill anyone . - Alright . let 's go . Visiting hours is 1 0 to 4 . Monday through Friday . What are you doing ? You son of a bitch ! You shot me ! He 'll live . Son of a bitch ! Let 's all try to remain calm . - Open it or he 'll be dead ! There 's no way . Connor . Let him go . Open the door ! - lt ain 't gonna happen . Take it easy , Sarah . It won 't work . Sarah . You 're no killer . You 're already dead , Silberman . Everybody here dies . So don 't fuck with me ! Open the door . Back off ! Get back or I 'II pump him full of this shit . I swear ! Don 't move ! Drop the shit ! Do it ! Do it ! Get in the office ! On the floor ! Face down ! Not you ! Open the door ! On the floor ! hold it open ! Face the wall ! Get her ! Come on , open it ! Come on ! She just broke it off . - Open it . Let 's go around. come on ! Move it ! No ! No ! Mom ! Wait ! No ! Help her . - Wait here . He 'll kill us all ! He 'll kill us all ! Mom , are you okay ? Come with me . if you want to live . It 's okay . Mom . He 's here to help . Go ! What the fuck is going on ? Get down ! Out of the car ! Right now ! I 'm out . Come on ! - Here . Reload ! Next one . Hang on ! Ready ! Here , drive ! There 's nobody behind us . Are you alright ? - Yeah . Can you even see anything ? I see everything . cool . Come here . I said I was okay . John , it was stupid of you to go there . You have to be smarter than that . You almost got yourself killed . What were you thinking ? You cannot risk yourself , even for me , do you understand ? You 're too important ! You understand ? I had to get you out of that place . I 'm sorry . I didn 't need your help . I can take care of myself . What 's wrong with your eyes ? Nothing . So what 's your story ? You okay ? - Fine . Say , that 's a nice bike . Hey , watch it , lug nuts . Listen , you know what you are doing ? I have detailed files on human anatomy . - l bet . Makes you a more efficient killer , right ? - Correct . Does it hurt when you get shot ? I sense injuries . The data could be called pain . John , help me with the light . will these heal up ? - Yes . Good . If you can 't pass for human , you 're not much good to us . How long do you live , I mean " last " , whatever ? 1 20 years with my existing power cell . Can you learn stuff you haven 't been programmed with ? So you can be ... you know. more human ? Not such a dork all the time ? My CPU is a neural-net processor . a learning computer , that Skynet presets to READ only when we are sent out alone . Doesn 't want you to do too much thinking . No . Can we reset the switch ? Rotate the two locking cylinders counterclockwise . Do it . Now open the port cover . Pull to break the seal . Good. now remove the shock damping assembly . You can now access the CPU . Do you see it ? - Yes . Pull the CPU by its base tap . Pull . Can you see the pin switch ? No ! Out of my way , John ! - Don 't kill him ! " It " . John , not " him " . Okay . " it " . But we need " it " . Listen to me . Listen . We 're better off on our own . He 's the only proof of the future. the war and that . Maybe . I don 't trust it . But he 's my friend. alright ? You don 't know what it 's like to kill these things . If something goes wrong , this could be our last chance . If I 'm supposed to be this military leader , maybe you start listening to my ideas once in a while . 'Cause if my own mother won 't , how do you expect anyone else to ? alright , play it your way . Was there a problem ? No problem . None whatsoever . Are we learning yet ? We have to get as far away from the city as possible . Just head south . Keep it under 65 . We don 't want to be pulled over . Affirmative . No , no , no . You got to listen to the way people talk . You don 't say " affirmative " or some shit like that . You say " No problemo " . If someone comes up to you with an attitude , you say " Eat me " . And if you want to shine them on. it 's " Hasta Ia vista. baby " . Hasta Ia vista. baby . Or " Later. dickwad " . If someone gets upset you say " chill out " . Or do combinations . Chill out , dickwad . You 're getting it . No problemo . You got any cash ? - l got a couple of hundred bucks . I 'II give you half . Mom ! Get some food . No sense of humor . And that 's another thing : Iighten up a bit . This severe routine is getting old . You 're acting like such a geek . Smile once in a while . Smile ? Yeah . You know , smile . Watch . Hi . Nice place you got here . How 's business ? Gimme a break . Okay . Bad example . See that guy over there ? That 's a smile . That 's good . You could practice in front of a mirror or something . Want some of my fries ? Do you need any help ? No . Got you ! - No. you didn 't ! Got you ! - You didn 't ! We 're not gonna make it , are we ? People . I mean . It 's in your nature to destroy yourselves . Yeah . Major drag , huh ? I need to know how Skynet gets built . Who 's responsible ? The man responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson . Who is that ? The director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation . Why him ? In a few months he creates a revolutionary microprocessor . Go on . Then what ? In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems . stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers . Becoming unmanned , they fly with a perfect operational record . The Skynet funding bill is passed . The system goes on-line on August 4th , 1 997 . Human decisions are removed from strategic defense . Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate . It becomes seIf-aware at 2 : 1 4 a.m. eastern time , August 29 . In a panic , they try to pull the plug . Skynet fights back . Yes. lt launches its missiles against targets in Russia . Why Russia ? They 're our friends now . Because Skynet knows that the Russian counterattack will eliminate its enemies here . - Jesus . How much do you know about Dyson ? I have detailed files . I want to know everything . What he looks like . Where he lives . Everything . Miles ! You going to work all day ? - l 'm sorry , baby . This thing is kicking my ass . It 's Sunday . You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today . I can 't . I 'm on a roll . This is gonna blow ' em away . It 's a neuraI-net processor . I know . You told me . It thinks and learns like we do . It 's superconducting at room temperature . Other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison . Why is that so important ? I need to know , 'cause sometimes I feel like I 'm going crazy here . Baby . I am this close . Come here . Imagine a jet airliner with a pilot that never gets tired , never makes mistakes . never shows up with a hangover . Meet the pilot . Why did we get married ? Have children ? You don 't need us . Your heart and your mind are in here . But it doesn 't love you like we do . I 'm sorry . really . How about spending some time with your other babies ? Raging Waters ? - Yeah ! Wait in the car . Enrique ? You here ? Pretty jumpy , Connor . What about you ? always on the lurk . Good to see you , Connor . - l promised to make it back . Man , I knew it . Good to see you . Yolanda . Get out here , we got company . And bring some tequila ! Oye . Big John ? Que pasa ? - What 's up ? Who 's your friend ? - He 's cool . He 's with me . He is uncle Bob . Uncle Bob. this is Enrique . Uncle Bob. huh ? Okay . How are you ? How are you ? You 've gotten big . Drink ? Uncle Bob ? SarahIita , you pretty famous . AII over the TV . Pictures of you . John , your big friend here . Cops are going nuts looking for you . Take the kid. honey. will you ? I just came for my stuff . I need clothes , food . and one of your trucks . How about the fillings out of my fucking teeth ? - Now . You two , you 're on weapons detail . - Come on . let 's go . One thing about my mom . she always plans ahead . Excellent . Nothing down here . This is the best truck I got . but the starter is gone . You got the time to change it out ? - Yeah . I 'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border . Enrique , it 's dangerous for you here . You get out tonight too. okay ? - Sure . Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life . See . I grew up in places like this , so I thought that 's how people lived : riding around in helicopters , learning how to blow shit up . But then. when my mom got busted , I got put in a regular school . The other kids were into Nintendo . Are you ever afraid ? No . Not even of dying ? No . You don 't feel any emotion about it one way or another ? No . I have to stay functional until the mission is complete . Then it doesn 't matter . Yeah. I have to stay functional too . I 'm " too important " . That 's definitely you . Most of the guys my mom hung round with were geeks . But there was this one guy . He was kinda cool . He taught me engines . Hold here . Mom screwed it up , of course . She 'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader . And that 'II be all she wrote . Torque wrench. please . - Here . I wish I could 've met my real dad . You will . Yeah. I guess . When I 'm . like , 45 , I think . I 'II send him back through time to 1 984 . He hasn 't even been born yet . It messes with your head . The other bolt . Here . Mom and him were only together one night . She still loves him . I guess . I see her crying sometimes . She denies it totaIIy. of course . Like she got something stuck in her eye . Why do you cry ? You mean people ? - Yeah . I don 't know . We just cry , you know . When it hurts . Pain causes it ? No , it 's different . It 's when there 's nothing wrong but you hurt anyway . You get it ? - No . alright ! My man ! No problemo . Gimme five . Put out your hand like this . Come on . alright . Now hit me . Gimme five . Do the same thing . - Alright ! Okay. that 's good . Up high. up high . Five low . Too slow . Just kidding . One more time . Watching John with the machine , it was suddenly so clear . The Terminator would never stop . it wouId never leave him . never hurt him , never shout at him or get drunk and hit him . or say it was too busy to spend time with him . It would always be there . And it wouId die to protect him . Of all the wouId-be fathers who came and went . this thing. this machine . was the only one who measured up . In an insane world . it was the sanest choice . She said you go south with him . She 'II meet you tomorrow . - Mom ! Mom ! Wait ! " No fate . " No fate but what we make . My father told her this . I mean . I made him memorize it. up in the future , as a message to her . Never mind . Now okay , the whole thing goes : " The future is not set . There is no fate but what we make for ourselves . " She intends to change the future . Yeah , I guess . Oh shit ! Dyson . Yeah , gotta be ! Miles Dyson ! She 's gonna blow him away ! Come on ! Let 's go ! This is tactically dangerous . - Drive faster . The T-1 000 has the same files that I do . It knows what I know . It might anticipate this move . I don 't care . We 've gotta stop her . killing Dyson might actually prevent the war . - I don 't care ! Haven 't you learnt anything yet ? Why you can 't kill people ? Look , maybe you don 't care if you live or die . But everybody 's not like that ! We have feelings . We hurt . We 're afraid . You gotta learn this stuff . I 'm not kidding. it 's important . Danny , I told you to go to bed like your sister . Just a couple of minutes , Mom . Danny , your time is up . Come brush your teeth and get to bed . Danny just go ! Oh my God ! Just take Danny and go . Run ! Oh Jesus . Miles . Nobody fucking move ! Don 't hurt my daddy ! Get on the floor ! Fucking down ! Now ! Get out of the way ! Don 't hurt him ! Get on the floor ! Fast ! Just let the boy go . Shut up ! Shut up ! It 's all your fault ! It 's all your fault ! - What ? I 'm not gonna let you do it . Shit , we 're too late . Check them . Look at me . Mom . Are you hurt ? Look at me . I almost ... I almost ... It 'II by okay . We 'll figure something out , okay ? Promise . You came here to stop me ? Yes , I did . I Iove you . John . I always have . I know . clean penetration . No shattered bone . Hold here . Compression should stop the bleeding . Who are you ? Show him . Danny , I want you to come with me . Show me your room . Oh. my God ! Now listen to me very carefully . Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down . Skynet . Judgment Day , the history of things to come . It 's not every day that you find out you 're responsible for 3 billion deaths . He took it pretty well . I feel like I 'm gonna throw up . You 're judging me on things I haven 't even done yet . How were we supposed to know ? Yeah . Right . How were you supposed to know ? Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb . Men like you thought it up . You think you 're so creative . You don 't know what it 's like to create something . To create a life . To feel it growing inside you . AII you know how to create is death and destruction . - Mom ! We need to be a little more constructive here , okay ? We still have to stop this from happening . But I thought ... Aren 't we changing things ? Changing the way it goes ? That 's right ! There 's no way I 'm gonna finish the processor . Not now . Forget it. I 'm out of it . I quit Cyberdyne tomorrow . - Not good enough . No one must follow your work . - Right , then ... We have to destroy the stuff at the lab . The files , drives ... Everything . Everything here . Everything ! I don 't care . Do you know about the chip ? - What chip ? In a vault at Cyberdyne . From the other one like you . The CPU from the first terminator . Son of a bitch . I knew it ! They told us not to ask where they got it . Those lying motherfuckers ! It was radically advanced . It was smashed. it didn 't work . But it gave us ideas . took us in new directions . Things we 'd never ... AII my work is based on it . - lt must be destroyed . Can you get us in. past security ? I think so , yeah . When ? Now ? The future , always so clear to me . had become like a black highway at night . We were in uncharted territory now , making up history as we went along . Hi . CarI. right ? Friends from outta town , Thought I 'd ... ... show them around . You know the rules concerning visitors . I need authorization ... I insist . Don 't even think about it . Takes 2 keys to open the vault . turned simultaneously . The other one is at the security station . Gibbons . Come on , man . you can 't leave the desk like that . Oh. shit . My card should access this . What is it ? - Dammit . The silent alarm 's been tripped . It 's neutralized all the codes in the building . Nothing 'II open anywhere now . We have to abort . No . We do it all the way ! Okay ? You guys get started on the lab . I can open this . I think it 's that guy from the mall . - It is the guy ! Him and the woman . Just send everything you 've got in the area . I have a personal entry code for the lab that may still work . It 's no good . - Let me try mine . John ! Fire-in-the-hoIe ! Wait ! You can 't go in there ! The fire 's set off the halo system ! You have to wait a few minutes , until the gas clears . Put this on . alright , let 's get to work . AII units in the vicinity . all units able to respond : A 2 1 1 in progress at 21 44 Kramer Street , the Cyberdyne building . Suspect 1 is white. female . identified as : last name Connor . first name Sarah , escaped from Pescadero State Hospital . Suspect 2 : white. male ... AII the disks in my office . All the disks in that office over there . Everything behind my desk . AII the processors on my left . We 'll blow it up with the CP4 . could I ... Excuse me ... could I borrow that thing ? I worked a lot of years on this thing . Give me that location again . - 21 1 1 , Kramer . The suspects are armed and considered extremely dangerous . alright , 7-2-5-6 . Yes ! Easy money . Oh. shit . Not good . Not good . How we doing ? - primal cord is set . One more barrel . two more minutes . How do we set them off ? - Remote control . Piece of cake . We got company . - police ? How many ? - All of them , I think . Go ! I 'II finish here . I 'II take care of the police . - Wait. you swore ... Trust me . Hey you at the window , drop your weapon and place your hands on top of your head . That 's a damn mini-gun ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Fire ! We go the same time to the left . One , two. three. go ! alright . In order to get that out , you ... We got Skynet by the balls now . don 't we ? Come on . let 's book ! Hold your fire ! Ready to rock ? - Ready . Time to go . Now .

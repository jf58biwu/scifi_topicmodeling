 Professor ! Catherine . Watch your step . OK . - We have found something beautiful ! I don 't believe it . Big , big surprise ! - Yeah ? I can hardly wait . Over here ! Dr. Langford . - Hello . What have we here ? Cover stones . It 's fantastic . Catherina , come ! What in God 's name is that ? - I wish I knew . ... there are symbols painted everywhere . Names , titles of owners , list of offerings . Every other major architectural structure at the time was covered with detailed hieroglyphics . When is the academic community going to accept the fact the pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty did not build the Great Pyramid ? Inside the pyramid , the most incredible structure ever erected , there are no writings whatsoever . - Dr. Jackson , you left out the fact that Colonel Vyse discovered quarrymen 's inscriptions of Khufu 's name within the pyramid . His discovery was a fraud . Well , I hope you can prove it . Who do you think built the pyramids ? I don 't have any idea who built them . Men from Atlantis ? Or Martians perhaps ? The point is not who built them , the point is when they were built . I mean we all know , new geological evidence dates the Sphinx back to a much earlier period . Knowing this , I think , we have to begin to re-evaluate everything we 've come to accept about ... I 've been able to show a fully developed writing system appeared in the 1st two dynasties . Almost as if it was based on an even earlier prototype . Is there a lunch or something , that everybody ... ? Dr. Jackson ! - What ? Yes ? Someone wants to speak with you . The Air Force ? What is this ? - Could you step over to the car ? We goin ' somewhere ? - You 're gonna be fine . We 'll take care of these . Those your parents ? Foster parents . What is this all about ? A job . What kind of a job ? Translation . Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics . Interested ? I 'm gonna go now . Go where ? You 've just been evicted . Your grants have run out . Everything you own are in those two bags . You want to prove that your theories are right ? This is your chance . What 's this ? Travel plans . Mrs. O 'Neil ? Come on in . Mrs. O 'Neil , is your husband home ? Yes . Do you think we might be able to speak with him ? You can try . Excuse me , Colonel O 'Neill , we 're from General West 's office . We 're here to inform you that you 've been reactivated . That guy 's a mess . How 'd he get like that ? - His kid died . Accidentally shot himself . - Jesus . Cleared . Cold ? Allergies . Always happens when I travel . There you go . Dr. Jackson , Dr. Gary Meyers . - Hello . - How are you ? What is this place ? - Nuclear missile silo . Now don 't worry , it 's been completely converted . Barbara Shore . OK , Jackson , welcome to the well . - Hello . Where did you find this ? - Giza Plateau , 1928 . I 've never seen anything like this . - Of course you haven 't . No one has . - Now there 's two lines of hieroglyphics . The inner track has the classic figures . But the outer track is like the cartouche in the center . It 's got writing unlike we 've ever found before . - Those aren 't hieroglyphics . It might be some kind of hieratic or cuneiform . Well the translation of the inner track is wrong . Must have used Budge . I don 't know why they keep reprinting his books . Excuse me . What are you doing ? We 've used every known technique . That 's a curious word to use eh , " Gebeh ? " Yeah . - Then an adverbial , " sedjem-en-ef . " Then " sealed and ... buried . " Excuse me , what are you doing ? It 's not " coffin . " " For all time . " Who the hell translated this ? I ... I did . Well this should read " A million years into the sky is Ra , Sun God , sealed and buried for all time . " It 's not " door to heaven , " it is ... " Stargate . " Well , so , why is the military so interested in 5,000 year-old Egyptian tablets ? My report says ten thousand . Afternoon , Colonel . Do I know you ? - I 'm Colonel Jack O 'Neil , from General West 's office . I 'll be taking over from now on . This figure , 10,000 , is ludicrous . Egyptian culture didn 't even exist until ... We know , but the sonic and radiocarbon tests are conclusive . - Well these are cover stones . Was there a tomb underneath ? No , no , no , no . But we found something a lot more interesting . - Excuse me . This information has become classified . From now on , no information is to be passed on to non-military personnel without my express permission . What 's going on ? - I 'm not sure . Colonel O 'Neil . I think you owe me an explanation . I was told I had complete autonomy . Plans change . Why are you here ? Why did they bring you on this project ? I 'm here in case you succeed . TWO WEEKS LATER Completed search of cuneiform and other pre-dynastic hieroglyphics . No matches whatsoever . I 've exhausted all reference material in comparing the symbols on the cartouche against all known writing samples from the period , pre and post . Still no similarities . I 'm never gonna get paid . Can I borrow this ? Orion . Right here , Daniel . - Jackson , I 'd like you to meet General West . - Oh hello . Oh ! Right , General . So you think you 've solved in 14 days what they couldn 't solve in 2 years ? 2 years ? Any time . I have some stuff to look at . If you 'll just pass ' em down . You 'll have to share them , cuz I , I 'm sorry I don 't have enough . Anyway ... We 're obviously looking at the picture of the cover stones . Now , on the outer track , these figures that you had believed to be words to be translated were in fact ... were , in fact , star constellations . These constellations were placed in a unique order , forming a map or address of sorts . Seven points to outline a course to a position . To find the destination within any three-dimensional space we need six points to determine an exact location . You said you needed seven points . Well no , six for the destination . but to chart a course you need ... a point of origin . Except there 's only six on the cartouche . The 7th isn 't actually inside the cartouche . It 's just below , designated by ... a little pyramid with ... two ... funny ... neat little guys and a funny line coming out of the top . Anyway , uh ... He did it . No . That symbol isn 't anywhere on the device . Uh what device ? I don 't ... Show him . What is that ? It 's your " Stargate . " Come , Jackson . Monitors up ! - Monitors are up . Mitch , you wanna bring up the details on the center monitor , please ? I 've got details ... on . Hold it . Wait . Do you have a , uh oh , here . Sorry . Hey hey hey don 't ! - Two figures ... on either side , praying beside a pyramid with the sun directly above it . He 's right . It was in front of us the whole time . General West , Jackson has identified the 7th symbol . Go ahead . - Programming 7th symbol into computer . Chevron 1 is holding . Chevron 1 is locked in place . Power output at 23 percent . Chevron 2 is holding . Engaged . - Chevron 2 is locked in place . - We 're at 35 percent . All right we 've got a condition red in the gate . Evacuate all personnel . Area secure . Heading back . Seal the door . This was under the cover stones ? - Yes . My father found it . 1928 . Made out of a mineral unlike any found on Earth . Chevron 5 lock in place . 79 percent . Chevron 6 is holding . Chevron 6 is locked in place . This is as far as we have ever been able to get . The breakers aren 't holding . Override manually . Chevron 7 is locked in place . Send in the probe . Let 's go ! Yes , sir . Record all information from the Stargate . Clear inner silo for approach . - Everybody outta here . - Let 's go ! It 's guiding itself . Can you believe that ? The beam has locked itself onto a point somewhere in the Kaliam galaxy . It has mass . It could be a moon or a large asteroid . Where are we on that map ? The blue dot . That 's right , Jackson . It 's on the other side of the known universe . We 're losing the signal . This is the information the probe sent back to us . Freeze and enhance . You can clearly see the gate on the other side . Both gates must have functioned as a doorway between our worlds . These readings tell us it 's an atmospheric match . Barometric pressure , temperature and most importantly , oxygen . These markings are different . They don 't match the symbols on our gate . - That 's why we may have to abort . This project is for naught without a reconnaissance mission . Once there we would have to decipher the markings on their gate and , in essence , dial home , in order to bring the team back . Based on this new information , I don 't see how we can do that . Well , I could do that . Are you sure ? Positive . He 's full of shit . You 're on the team . You understand , this complicates things . That 's why I wanted you , Jack . We 've opened a door to a world we know nothing about . I have something for you . No , I ... - Yes . I found it with the Stargate when I was a child . It has brought me luck . You can bring it back to me . Back-up storage . Reserve power , on . We 're secure . Clear the area . - Move it , let 's go . Surveillance and monitoring . ... equipment , reserve power ... If anybody has anything to say , now 's the time to say it . Vector tracking set . Molecular deconstruction in progress . Jackson , it 's all right . It 's over . Stay with him . Jackson just listen to me . Keep moving . It wears off in a minute . What a rush ! Prepare to move out . It 's all here , yeah . Three teams , let 's go . White team , go ! Team 2 Move up ! Clear , no contact . O2 ratio stable . - Conditions are similar to inside . I wanna take a look around . Kawalsky , Feretti . Let 's rock ' n roll . Move up there , good . I knew it . One - three - three - two . Report . Our quarter mile perimeter survey is just about complete , sir . Wrap this up , get everybody back inside . I want you all people back through the Stargate within the hour . You 're coming with us aren 't you , Colonel ? Jackson , start working on the Stargate . What 's that all about ? - I don 't know Feretti . I 'm gonna need more time . There 's bound to be more structures , or some other traces of civilization . Not this trip . Just get back in there and re-establish contact . Well it 's not that easy . This is a replica of the great pyramid of Giza . We 're not gonna find any hieroglyphic inscriptions or carved relief . We ... really ... we really need to look around more . Your job is to re-align the Stargate . Can you do that or not ? I can 't . You can 't , or you won 't ? I can decipher the symbols on the Stargate , but I need an order of alignment . Now those co-ordinates were marked on tablets back on Earth . And there must something like that here . And I just ... I just need to find it . Find it ? What do you mean , " find it ? " You didn 't say anything about finding anything . - Well , I assumed the tablets would be here . You assumed ? You 're a lying son of a bitch ! You didn 't say a word about finding anything ! Set up a camp down here . Organize our supplies . Sir ? You 've got your orders . This is hot . You know , I can 't believe we 're stuck here . - Don 't be such a doomsayer Faretti . Yeah , give it a rest . - Yes , please . If we 're not back soon , they 'll just turn on the gate from the other side . Oh no . It doesn 't work that way . You see , if you don 't turn it on from here , we 're screwed . Ok ? So I 'm tellin ' you guys , we 're not goin ' anywhere . - Shutup . This is a nice tent . Oh , we each get a tent . That 's nice . ... the hell is that ? A thermal blanket , don 't need that . I got everything here but sun-block . Hey ! Hi . Hey . Isn 't there something you should be doing right now ? Like getting us outta here ! Foot powder . Great . That 's cold , man . Base camp is up , sir . Where 's Jackson ? It 's OK . No , It 's OK . Shh . Shh . Shh ... That 's a good boy ... What do you want ? You want some of this ? Here ya go . Ya like that ? There ya go . There ya go . I wouldn 't feed that thing ! It 's got a harness . It 's domesticated ! Dammit . Let go of it ! Do something ! Come on ! Help me ! You OK , Jackson ? Kawalsky . - You dropped these . - Brown . Get away from me . Easy . All right , Jackson . You 're on . Me ? You 're the linguist . Try to talk to ' em . Hi . What the hell did you say to him ? - Nothing . Hey . It 's OK . It 's OK . See ? Quartz , primary element . I can 't make it out ... It sounds familiar , a bit like Berber . Or maybe it 's Chadic or Omotic . Thank you . What 's that mean ? I have no idea . He 's inviting us to go with him . How can you be so sure ? Because he 's inviting us to go with him . We were looking for signs of civilization . Obviously we 've found it . You want me to get us back home , this is our best shot . - Colonel he 's right . I took some readings on what they 're mining . This is the same material as the Stargate . Radio base camp . Tell them to keep that area secure , until we get back . - Yes , sir . Base camp , come in . - Feretti , I 've got ' em . Come on . Yes Sir ? What ... can you repeat that , sir ? ... Col. O 'Neil has requested that you secure base camp . Looks like we 're gonna be here for awhile . OK , sir . - Understand ? - Yes , sir . So what 's the story ? - They 're not coming back . OK , this is not good . The eye of Ra . It 's the Egyptian Sun God . They think he sent us here . I wonder what could have give them that idea ... Ra . Ra ? Where they all going ? Come in . Come in . Feretti I can 't hear you . Sir , I can 't make this out . Feretti , say again . We have to abandon base camp ! Repeat , we have to abandon base camp ! It 's useless . It won 't work in this . Freeman , let 's go ! Let 's move ! Everybody back inside ! C 'mon just take what you can carry ! - Battery ! Get the battery packs ! We 're going back right now . Wait ! Get over here . Stay here . What is it , Colonel ? - Sandstorm . Coming this way . That would have been an excellent reason to shoot everyone . We 'll stay until it 's over . Sorry . We 've gotta get back to the pyramid ! Where the hell 'd that come from ? Kawalsky , Brown , do you read ? Hey Jackson . I don 't think we should eat any food here . I don 't know . They might consider that an insult . Well , we don 't want to offend them now , do we , Daniel ? Tastes like chicken . Tastes like chicken . It 's good . It tastes ... Tastes like chicken . Good ! Jackson . You said that was an Egyptian symbol . - Yeah . The eye of Ra . Would you say then it might stand to reason that ... if they know one Egyptian symbol ... Yes . What the hell 's going on ? It seems like writing is forbidden to them . What ? They want me to go with them . Should I stay ? I 'll go with them . I 'll be fine . OK , that 's good . What is that smell ? I think that 's good . My hands are clean . Thank you very , very much . Thank you , very , that was very nice . Thank you . That was great . I smell much better now than ... Yes , thank you . O Christ , I smell like a yak . No , no please , no more , please . Please no more . I 'm fine . I 'm clean ... I 'm ... I 'm ... Oh . I thought you were one of the other cleaning ... No , no , no . You don 't have to do that . Maybe you should go . OK ? It 's OK . Maybe you should go . No , no . It 's OK . It 's OK . It 's all right . Here , let me grab this No , no , no no , it 's me . I wanted to uh , th-thank you . I 'm very , I 'm very happy . Thank you . Daniel . I 'm Daniel . We came ... uh This pyramid . See , we came from ... We came from the pyramid . It 's OK . Never mind . It 's OK . The Earth . You know the symbol ? You know the symbol ? You 've seen the symbol ? Show me . You show me . Kawalsky , this is base . Do you copy ? You 're wasting the battery . We 'll never get anything in this storm . You 'll have to wait till it passes . - Yeah , right . IF it passes . You know I was stationed in the Middle East . I 've never seen anything like it . Yeah , yeah ... - I don 't understand . Why don 't we just turn the gate back on ourselves . yeah , how hard can it be ? - That would be great ! We could turn the thing in the wrong order and materialize the vacuum of outer space . Do you have any idea how many possible combinations there are ? No . How many ? Shut up . What the hell is goin ' on ? All right , spread out . Let 's move out ! It 's OK . It 's just a lighter . See ? Here ! Yeah , it 's pretty fabulous . You 're right . It 's pretty stupid . No , you keep it . It 's yours . No ! It 's dangerous ! What is this place ? I 'll be damned . What ? No signal at all ? - Nothing . More interference ? No . They 're simply not there . ... no sign of him ? - I haven 't been able to locate Jackson , sir . I 'm lookin ' for Jackson . Jackson . The guy that wears this jacket . He 's uh , he 's got like long hair that comes down ... no , no . No , no , no , no it 's ... He wears glasses , so he can see . I guess the word " dweeb " doesn 't mean anything to you guys , does it ? Why not ? I 'm on Planet X lookin ' for a dweeb , He wears green fatigues . He wears this jacket . He 's got long hair . It comes over his eyes . He wears glasses , and ... sneezes . Chicken , chicken ! Chicken man . You got it . You want this ? I thought you couldn 't speak their language . Huh ? Hi ... scared me . It 's an ancient Egyptian dialect . I mean in like the rest of their culture it 's evolved completely independently . But uh , once you know the vowels ... Just answer the question . I just had to learn how to pronounce it . It hasn 't been a living spoken language for more than one thousand years . I mean look at this . It says , " A traveler from distant stars escaped from a dying world looking for a way to extend his own life . His body decaying and weak , he couldn 't prevent his own demise . " Apparently his whole species was becoming extinct . So he traveled or searched the galaxies , looking for a way to cheat death . Look here : He came to a world rich with life where he encountered a primitive race . Humans . A species which , with all his powers and knowledge , he could maintain indefinitely . He realized , within a human body , he had a chance for a new life . Now , he apparently , found a young boy . It says As the frightened villagers ran , night became day , curious and without fear , he walked towards the light . Ra took him and possessed his body , like some kind of a parasite , looking for a host . And inhabiting this human form he appointed himself ruler . He used the Stargate to bring thousands of people here to this planet as workers for the mines . Just like the one we saw . This mineral is clearly the building block of all his technology . With this he can sustain eternal life . Now uh , something happened , where is it , back on Earth ... A rebellion , or uprising , and the Stargate was buried there . Fearful of a rebellion here , Ra outlawed reading and writing . He didn 't want the people to remember the truth . Jackson , I think you better take a look at this . That 's it . That 's what we 're looking for . They must have hidden it here , in hopes that one day the gate on Earth could be reopened . I knew they 'd have it written down someplace . Wait a minute . Where 's the 7th symbol ? It must have broken . It 's gotta be here somewhere ... Got it . I got it here . It 's worn off . I can 't make it work without the 7th symbol . All right , that 's it . Kawalsky , Brown . Come on , Jackson . What the hell is that ? Here . You might need this . Look out ! Where are we going ? Why are we going to the Stargate ? I can 't make it work . Stay right here and shoot at anything that comes down that ramp . - What are you doing ? - Just cover me . What is that ? What are you looking for ? - It 's gone . Put it down , Jackson . You have come here to destroy me . What is that ? It 's a bomb isn 't it ? That 's what you were looking for . What the hell were you thinking ? What 'd you come here for ? Wait ! Don 't ! No ! No ! No ! Colonel , it 's me . You all right ? Where 's Jackson ? Sha 'uri , what happened here ? Ra punished us . Why ? What happened to Daniel ? What happened to Daniel ? Son , we should not have helped the strangers . I was dead ? That is why I chose your race ... your bodies , so easy to repair . You have advanced much ... harnessed the power of the atom . What are you going to do ? You should not have reopened the gate . Son , I will send your weapon back to your world , with a shipment of our mineral , which will increase your weapon 's destructive power a hundredfold . Why would you do that ? I created your civilization , now I will destroy it . But before my workers question my authority , you will prove that I am their one God , by killing your companions . If I refuse ? Then I will destroy you , and all who have seen you . There can be only one Ra ! Sha 'uri , Ra has called an assembly . An execution . Skaara , Nabeh , I want you to listen . We can 't let this happen . I want you to know what Daniel told me , about where our people came from , and why we can no longer live as slaves . C 'mon ! Freeman ! Freeman ! Freeman ! Jackson ! Follow me ! Come on ! Kawalsky ! C 'mon ! Jackson ! To our victory ! We recovered your weapons . Here , Colonel . So , what do you think ? They 're not exactly special forces , but they sure were eager to join up . Take these guns away , Lieutenant , before they hurt themselves . Sir ? You heard me . Send ' em all home . - There 's no place for these kids to go . Anyway we could sure use their help right now . - For what ? Huh ? To do what ? Why don 't you just tell ' em everything ? Why don 't you tell ' em about the bomb ? What 's he talking about ? My orders were simple . Track down signs of any possible danger . If I found any , blow up the Stargate . Well , I found some . Well , your bomb is his now , and tomorrow he 's going to send it back to Earth , along with a shipment of that mineral they mine here . And when that thing goes off , it 's gonna cause an explosion 100 times more destructive than that bomb alone is capable of . I 'll intercept that bomb before he can send it through . Why wasn 't I told of this ? Because there wasn 't any reason to tell you Kawalsky . You weren 't even supposed to be here You were all gonna go right back through with Daniel . I was gonna stay behind alone and blow up the Stargate and that 's exactly what I 'm going to do . It 's the gate on Earth that poses a threat that 's the one we have to shut down . You 're absolutely right . But since you don 't know how to get us back , we don 't have that option , do we ? Where are they ? Answer ! We looked everywhere . Some kids are helping them . You had accepted the fact that no matter what happened , you would not be going home ? Don 't you have people who care about you ? Do you have a family ? I had a family . No one should ever have to outlive their own child . I don 't wanna die . Your men don 't wanna die . And these people here don 't wanna die . It 's a shame you 're in such a hurry to . How could you let them escape ? I will not accept failure ! Why are you laughing ? - Husbands don 't do this work . Husbands ? Married ? Don 't be angry . I didn 't tell them . Tell them what ? That you did not want me . What are you drawing ? The day of our victory . Connect the moons ... This is the symbol for this planet . That 's it . The point of origin . What are you doing ? I 've found it ! What are you talking about ? The 7th symbol . We 're goin ' home . Let 's go . You 'll bring disaster to all of us , son . Father , we will not live as slaves . Kasuf ! Take a look at your Gods . Take a good look . The caravan is approaching . Send the bomb down to the Stargate . What 's happening up there ? How you doin ' ? Damn ! Come on , Feretti ! Come on ! Get that door ! Hey , you OK ? You all right ? Spread out ! Let 's go ! We 're dead ! - Quit talking like that man ! - Well what 're we gonna do ? - Cover me . Cover you ? Kawalsky ! C 'mon Feretti , help me push this thing over . Send the bomb to Earth now . I will send it myself . What are you doing ? - Completing this mission . We agreed to dismantle the gate on the other side . - And you will . That 's your job now . I 'm gonna stay here and make sure this goes off . You 've got seven minutes . Daniel . What are you doing ? Jackson ! - Wait for me . Nabeh ! You got any rounds at all , Feretti ? - We 're all out of ammo . - Incoming . - Get down ! Kawalsky , we gotta do something . Damn . Stop ! I am no longer amused . You will die together . Give my regards to King Tut , asshole . How much time do we have left ? - 45 seconds . He 's leaving . Turn it off . - I 'm trying to I can 't disarm it . - What ? I can 't stop it they got it rigged . I got an idea . I always knew you 'd get us back . - Yeah , right . - Later . Thanks , Daniel . You sure you wanna do this ? Yes , I 'm sure . You gonna be all right ? I 'm gonna be all right . How about you ? Yeah . Yeah , I think so . Tell Catherine this brought me luck . I will . I 'll be seein ' you around , Dr. Jackson

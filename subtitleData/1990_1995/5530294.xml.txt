 Last week on Wild Palms : Your father blew his face off with a shotgun . - There is a way out , Grace . - To where , Hiro . To paradise ? - Is Coty my son , Paige ? Answer me ! - He 's mine ! I had him with the senator . You begged for this life . Did you think there wasn 't a price to pay ? Chickie ! Will you need me for anything else ? No . Good night , Tobias . And thank you . Heard from your wife , Harry ? - Who are you ? - I 'm sorry . Poor habit of mine . Lieutenant Bob Grindrod . Grace 's in Japan . Soon as I find out where , I 'm going over . I think she 's with her daddy . I think Eli Levitt 's pulled a real number on her . Patty Hearst style . Dangerous man . And not a great situation for the little girl Deirdre . That 's her name , isn 't it , Harry ? The audacity of Tully Woiwode ! Holding my lovely bride-to-be hostage with a stiletto like so much terrorist fodder . You were a hostage , weren 't you , Paige ? What 's that supposed to mean ? It 's all too horrible to think of . There was poor Tully , back in the catbird seat his heart revving furiously as he imagine himself carving up the gorgeous neck of his beloved sister 's assassin . Yet something stopped him . What do you think that was , Paige ? I 've had a hell of a time keeping you out of the press . I didn 't know you cared . Mimecom 's about to go public . Your various affiliations don 't exactly make you employee-of-the-month material . Can I share something with you , Grindrod ? I feel a definite urge to seriously slap you around . Why don 't you climb out of my life and crawl back into whatever wet hole you call home ? The senator 's the best friend you 've got , Harry ! Anybody else would have thrown you to the dogs a long time ago ! - I was looking for you . - He knows where they are . - What ? - Deirdre and Grace , that son-of-a-bitch lieutenant knows ! He was playing with me . Watching me squirm . He 's holding them right here on the grounds just like they did Chickie ! - Harry , calm down ! - Calm down ! The woman who just married the antichrist tells me to calm down ? I don 't think they 've been hurt . I 'm trying to find out what happened . Why hasn 't Tommy gotten in touch with me , huh ? - Why hasn 't somebody called me ? - It 'll be all right ! If they knew Grace and Deirdre were back at the house waiting . If they knew that much they must 've known I 'm involved ! They 'll be coming after me . - Harry , stop it ! - You 're with them , Paige , aren 't you ? You killed for them . How many , Paige ? How many ? Am I next , huh ? Why don 't you just do me right here ? - Harry , please ! - I 'm losing it , you know that ? I 'm losing it ! I gotta do something . Or kill the senator . Don 't get crazy . Let it settle , or you 'll lose everything . Hey ! Have a hot wedding night . I wanna play a little something for you we just taped with the new Mimecom . I taped it ! He taped it . It 's portable and it costs about the same as a black-market pancreas . We 'll have it on the market sometime in the fall . Ladies and gentlemen forget about instant replay . Welcome to instant relive . Play it , Sam . - What do you have ? - Gavin Whitehope 's kid . Picked him up in Barstow on his way to the Wilderzone . He helped kill Chap Starfall . We think he 's the one who leaked Chickie 's move to the motel . Bury him . Right this way . Yes . See , we really don 't encourage them . They 're so noisy and troublesome . - Don 't you agree ? - Oh , yes , yes . And so terribly annoying when they cry . Yes . I don 't know what to do when they cry . - Do you , dear ? - Drown them like puppies . As you see , the nursery 's far from the rest of the house . This is my favorite part . I always think they 're gonna go down underneath the pool , like the Friends . Do you know where my wife and daughter are ? Nobody watches movies anymore . Only TV . Look how happy Plato is . He thinks Natalie Wood and James Dean are his mom and dad . - What did you come back here for . - Because I 'd run away . Oh , I used to run away a lot but they always took me back . Who ? Peter are they still alive ? Deirdre 's with the Fathers , somewhere in the desert . And Grace ? O captain , my captain Our fearful trip is done The ship has weather 'd every rack The prize we sought is won Red light . Green light . Red light ! Green light . Harry ! Tully ! Come on , down . - You can see ? - I do all right . It 's hardwired to the cortex . Sit down . You look awful . Where 's Grace ? - Eli doesn 't want to take the chance . - Damn it . Tully ! Maybe in a week . - Is she all right ? - She 's fine . Choko can we have some whiskey here ? Tully , what happened that night ? They got Deirdre . Left Grace for dead at the old bathhouse . We patched her up like new , so stop worrying . What do you think of the club ? Fabulous . The Wilderzone has its own laws . Cops stay away . Easy for a blind artist and his fugitive friends to blend in . I know what Grace was going through . I know why she was cracking up . I don 't wanna sit around anymore . What do you want to do , Harry ? Throw Molotovs ? Hey , look who 's here . Stranger in a strange land . Tommy . God . I didn 't think I was gonna see you again . Are you all right ? - Never better . - He 's been partying . Partying is such sweet sorrow . Not exactly your part of the neighborhood , Harry . Welcome to the Fourth World . Hey , Choko , I 'm starving . Fix me some food , woman . Good to see you , Harry . Stick around . This place will grow on you . Hey , Choko ! - What 's the matter with him ? - Mimezine sickness . He 's not responding to the antigens . Pretty soon , he 'll be ringing the bell at Notre Dame . Tully , what am I supposed to do ? Get drunk and go bowling ? - Business as usual , Harry . - Well , at least let me speak to Eli . The general ain 't around . Well , let me join the Friends . I wanna do something . Stay close to the senator . Tell us everything on his sick little mind . You wanna be a samurai , Harry ? Now 's your chance . How are you feeling ? Why didn 't they just kill me ? Josie must have intervened . If it were up to Josie , I 'd be buried somewhere under the Hollywood sign . I miss my baby . I know . Do you think she 's safe ? - Yes . We 'll get her back . - Like we got Chickie ? Why did you take my tapes away from me ? I don 't want you watching them torturing yourself . Don 't you like seeing your little granddaughter ? It isn 't her . It 's a trick , Grace . A hologram . They dump those tapes on the black market . - New ones , every few days . - But what if it isn 't a trick ? She talks , Grace . Why would Deirdre suddenly talk on tape . To strangers ? It isn 't her . I 'm sorry . Get some sleep . I love you . Mommy , it 's Deirdre . I miss you . Why won 't you come rescue me ? They 're hurting me . Mommy , why won 't you come ? Mommy , it 's Deirdre . I miss you . Why won 't you come rescue me ? They 're hurting me . Mommy , why won 't you come ? Mommy , it 's Deirdre . I miss you . - What was it ? - A cyst . - I want you to take these for a week . - Antibiotics ? You 've got an infection . Who gave you that tattoo , Harry ? Oh , I got it on Hollywood Boulevard one night . I was very drunk . Midlife crisis ? - Hey , lighten up , doc ? - Have you got an hour ? You 're due for a physical . It 's been a couple of years . Nope . I gotta go down to the desert to see the senator . Are they gonna get him on the ballots ? That 's the idea . Thanks . By the way , I 'm sorry about Grace . I hope it all works out . This is Arnold Klein . He was here . Looking for someone ? It 's so much easier if you drain the pool first . Well ... The prodigal son returns . With a message : Leave Grace alone . And so demanding . Don 't you feel anything ? She was like a mother to you . There are no mothers , Peter , only fathers . Coty , they 're using you . Soon you 'll be too famous , you 'll be dangerous to them . Pathetic , you know . Why don 't you go sell a map ? Oh , you think Josie 's gonna actually give you any real power ? - Better get out . - She 'll have you killed . And no one will ever know . Once the ratings drop they 'll sell your holographic image like an old video game . You 'll be a relic , a Milton Berle . Mr. Virtual Television . Little freak . I 'll put you in that pool and your dirty friends won 't be waiting at the drain . Leave my mother alone . You 're too late , little punk . We made sure she was in church real early today . She 's praying right now . We 're talking with presidential candidate Senator Tony Kreutzer . The man who dragged us , for better or for worse into the age of virtual telepresence . Let 's talk about Synthiotics . Been talking about it for 30 years , Billie . One social critic defined the quasi-religious movement as and I quote : " A dangerous cult of techno-shamanists whose members worship its billionaire founder . " Just what are the goals of Synthiotics , senator and what role will the group play if you 're elected ? There 's a saying we have at Synthiotics : " What a difference an ' A ' makes . With a tiny letter ' A ' you can change a worrier into a warrior . " Let 's leapfrog the homilies for a moment , if we ... Powerful stuff , don 't you think ? Very effective . After the Billie Wheaton show , I jumped 18 points in the polls . - Hello , Harry . - Paige . What happened to your hand ? Oh , a cyst . Come out to the garden , Harry . I wanna talk to you . Your old boyfriend and I are gonna compare notes . Very funny . Something 's wrong . - Tell me . - They killed Ushio last night . The guy who gave me the tattoo ? - Where , Kyoto ? - No , here in L.A. , the Wilderzone . - What 's this all about ? - Harry , I 'm scared . - It 's all right . It 's all right . - Careful . Hungry , Harry ? No . I grabbed something before I came . Everybody 's hungry . Everybody 's a hungry ghost . What do you mean ? It 's a Buddhist thing like our hell . Hungry ghosts are souls doomed to wander the earth in torment and insatiable desire . Should I have that developed ? Sounds like a Channel 3 sitcom . Play the ponies , Harry ? Once in a while . I like the exactas . Santa Anita . Lovely track . They used it during the Second World War . Called it an " assembly center . " For the camps ? They moved them out from there to Heart Mountain Manzanar . The people have forgotten all about that . Pearl Harbor changed everything for Mama . Your mother was Japanese ? Just a drop . But enough to satisfy Executive Order 9066 . They sent her to Manzanar . I 'm sorry . And he never took us to see her . Not even once . Crazy drunk all the time . " Mama was in the desert , " he said . " Helping government agents bury children who were bad . So we 'd better stay away . " She died a few weeks before the camps were liberated . - And your father ? - Cirrhosis . Thank God . I still think of him wandering the earth , speaking in tongues . The original hungry ghost . What the hell are you doing ? - What did they give you in Kyoto ? - What ? - Was it the Go-chip ? - No ! Ushio gave it to you , he said so . Why would you lie ? - I don 't know . - Does Woiwode have it ? - I don 't know . - Would you betray me , Harry ? - No ! - Would you keep me from eternity ? - Why did you go to the doctor ? - I had a cyst removed . Is that what eternity is ? A cyst ? My son ! You 're crazy ! Crazy ! Crazy ! Crazy ! Deirdre ? Mama 's here . Are you here , baby ? I came just the way you told me to . Are you here ? Josie . I wanna see my baby . Josie . - Mommy , I miss you . I miss you . - Baby ! Why won 't you come rescue me ? Mommy , it 's Deirdre . I miss you . Why won 't you come rescue me ? They 're hurting me . Mommy , why won 't you come ? I miss you . Why won 't you come rescue me ? Mommy ... It 's not here , senator . We 're too late . - Paige ? It 's me . - Where are you ? I 've been hiding out in movie theaters all day . Listen ... - Are you okay ? - Yeah , sort of . What 's going on ? Well , I can 't go home . Wherever that is . I think they 're gonna kill me . - I 'll come get you . - No . I 'm going to the Wilderzone . - Don 't think I 'll be ... - Hello , Harry . Harry . He hung up . - That was rude . - Don 't give me any crap . Let 's go . Get off me ! Get off me ! - You 're under arrest , Harry . - For what , jaywalking , Grindrod ? The murder of Grace Wyckoff . You better be lying , you son of a bitch . Tobias , where am I ? The Perceptory . I don 't know where the order came from . Grindrod , I thought he was gonna kill me . - He said Grace was ... - She 's dead . Oh , God ! Tobias , they killed her ! You 're in trouble . Where did you get the gun ? - Gun ? - The same that killed Maisie Woiwode . They 're setting me up ! The senator 's insane . He killed Grace . - He 's got my daughter . - Listen to me , Harry . - You 've got to tell them everything . - Everything . You don 't know what you 're up against . Listen , Harry . The senator only wants the chip . Where is it , Harry ? Tell them or you 'll never get out of here . Tobias , I don 't know ! Mimezine . A thousand units . No ! No , Tobias ! You son of a bitch ! No ! What 's wrong , darling ? They ... They told me you died . Have you been having one of your crazy dreams again ? What 's that ? Just a flesh wound . How do you want your eggs ? Something 's weird . What is it , Grace ? What 's the matter with me ? You 're just working too hard , I guess . Love me ? Yes . I 'm so sorry , Grace . For everything that 's happened . Maybe we can start over . We can . Once you tell them where to find the Go-chip we can leave this place forever . Dad , come look . Don 't forget your briefcase . Coty ? Where 's the door . Where 's the damn door ? Make a break with Tommy and Tully . They got you into all this . I 'd never have been killed if it weren 't for them . You 've got to tell the senator about the Go-chip . I already told you , Grace . I don 't know anything . Do you know how much it hurts to be shot in the chest , Harry ? Don 't you even love us ? You care more about a bunch of wormless terrorists than you do love at your own flesh and blood ! Father ? Father . Tell Daddy what you know . Talk or Daddy 's gonna beat the brains out of that fat freaking head . Dad ! He 's going into shock . He doesn 't know anything . He would have talked . Give him the antigen . Then get him the hell out of here . Hey , dream boy , back for more ? I only have enough for a gram . What you doing with the stuff , dream boy ? I know you can 't be doing it all yourself . It 's for my mother . How about some holotapes to get you through the night ? I got some travel tapes . Some sex stuff . Porn from Osaka . Give me the Mimezine . You one gimme-gimme dream boy . You know where to find me . Ahoy , captain . Well , don 't you look grand . Deirdre 's been cooped up too long . It isn 't healthy . Has she complained ? I haven 't heard a word . Grandma , what 's gonna happen after Church Windows ? You know , when people get tired of watching . They 'll never get tired . Don 't lie to me . In a year , I could be history . What 's gotten into you ? Are there other shows being developed ? - Well , of course , there are . - For me ? Yes . Don 't be silly . Well , what are they ? I don 't know , darling . That 's the programmers ' domain . I want the details now . You 're acting like a child . Don 't ever say that to me . And don 't you underestimate me . When you killed your daughter , your pulse never rose above normal . We 're alike in that way . But my crimes will be grander , I assure you . One day , I 'll put out the sun and make bare every womb there ever was . Fix me a drink , will you ? Tobias really botched it with Harry . What happened ? Just when he was about to tell us all about the Go-chip Harry had this big old scary heart attack . Just kidding . But very good . You barely even flinched . Where do you think you 're going ? I 'm going to sleep in town tonight , in my own bed . No , you 're not . You 're going to take a drive . I want you to pick up Harry at the Resort and take him to the Wilderzone . How ? In half an hour , Channel 3 will announce that the arrest of attorney Harry Wyckoff was an error . The real killer was picked up at WPN . I don 't understand . I need him out of prison . We made a deal with someone . How can I take Harry anywhere ? I 'm known . I 'll be recognized . Not in the Wilderzone . What am I supposed to do ? I want you to set up an exchange . The chip for Deirdre . This is a farce . What are we doing here ? Hiro said 9 : 30 . He 'll come . Remember , this was his idea . That 's what bothers me . This has to be one of Eli Levitt 's tricks . He 'll be here . He 's making the supreme sacrifice for his first love . Very Japanese . There he is . It 's better this way , Grace . Harry will be with the children . Beat me up , Scotty . - Where am I ? - Hiro turned himself in . The senator made a deal with him . Paige . I 'm gonna ... Harry , I 'm scared . Paige . I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna bring them ... I 'm gonna bring them down . Hey , hey , hey . It 's all right , little man . - It 's all right . - Don 't leave me . - Please , don 't leave me . - I 'm right here . Don 't worry , I 'm right here . Did they tell you I was there when Grace died ? Yeah . They told me . I tried to save her , but they held me back . They made me watch . I didn 't know about the camera . Don 't cry . After they left , I went over to her and we talked . And she knew who I was . I know she did . - She called me her wild child . - Knew who you were ? My foster parents always told me I was switched with another little baby boy they said it as a joke , but it wasn 't . Why did they have to kill her ? It 's gonna be all right . What 's the matter ? I want you to have this . What is it ? I wanna go home , Daddy . Please take me home . Hiro ! Hiro ! What 's happening ? Grapevine says you 're being transferred to the Resort , man . - When ? - Sometime tonight . Beware of the Pharm . They play with your head . Don 't worry , Chico . I come from a long line of tough bastards my grandpa liberated Dachau . Let them come . Ciao , baby . Amidst a gentle storm of speculation presidential candidate , Senator Tony Kreutzer will announce his running mate tonight from Wild Palms , his desert home . An ABC News poll showed the senator would garner 62 percent of the vote in a three-way race with incumbent ... For you , old friend . Knife with a rhino . I 've dreamt of this before . Is there anything we can do to help ? His system 's been pickled in Mimezine . Got too much of it in jail . A thousand units all at once . I gave him something , he should sleep . The senator 's made the ballots in 63 of the states . Tonight he 'll announce his running mate right after Church Windows . Who 's that gonna be , Paige ? - Josie . - Perfect . Do you have a plan ? I 've called a war meeting . I 'm gonna suggest that we blow Channel 3 all the way to hell . What 's that gonna do ? Put a serious crimp in sweeps week . It 'll turn the public against you . Besides , it 'll barely slow them down . I know . I worked there , remember ? Channel 3 is the beating heart of Wild Palms . Eli , you 've been in prison too long . They have too many arms . - Eli , he 's right . - You stay out of this . Look , even if you did some damage they 'd just reroute and broadcast from the desert compound . That 'll be our second target . " Be subtle to the point of formlessness . " A little poetry , Harry . - Sun Tzu , The Art of War . - Bravo , Harry Wyckoff . Television executive and weekend warrior . " Be mysterious to the point of soundlessness . " No more quotes . They took my children from me ! From all of us . The senator wants a trade . Deirdre for the Go-chip . If we give them the Go-chip , we 've played our last card . They 'll slaughter the Friends . Well , if we use arms , we 'll lose . There must be another way . Hi , Steve , sorry to bust in like this . I need some papers in my office . I didn 't think you had an office here anymore . You didn 't read the papers ? They let me out of jail . - I know . I know , but ... - It 'll just take a second . Where 's your access card ? It 's demagnetized . My son threw it in the pool . I can 't let you in , Mr. Wyckoff . Okay . No problem . Hey , listen , Steve . Think I can use the can before I leave ? - No way . - You 're killing me , Steve . Eli has the chip . He 'll make the exchange . He just needs a little time . Everything 's fine . Thank you , darling . Thank you . Wow , I never met anyone who lived in a church before . I feel so satanic . You 're sick . Let 's put on some old Black Sabbath records and eat sugar . Just babysit . Okay , Judy . I 'm trying to entertain you , Ivan . Would you stop being so Oedipal . I just don 't think Mom should be dating , that 's all . That 's exactly what Norman Bates said . I guess you 're right . Of course I am . And besides , what 's the worst that could happen ? She meets someone she likes , falls in love , elopes . Would that be so terrible ? Hi . - Who are you ? - Harry Wyckoff . I want you to put this on live feed . - You crazy ? - Yeah . Now , do it . - Want me to interrupt programming ? - Exactly . I guess I haven 't been acting very mature , huh ? Now that 's better . Are you ever gonna get married , Judy ? Married ? No way . Tully , I can hear them . I can hear the bells . Do it . Do it ! The last time he gave me a hickey the size of ... Get up , dog ! Weak dog ! When I think I gave birth to you , I am seized by revulsion ! Tommy , can you see ? Now , all the world will know . You tricked me ! Why , Mother ? I used to think you were like your father , but now I know . You aren 't like him . - Tommy . - Please , Mother ! Don 't leave me now . - You stillborn calf . - Please , please , Mother I wanna see my daughter . Please , Mother . Please . I 'm begging you ! Please , let me see my baby ! You 'll see her ... in hell ! Turn it off ! Oh , I 'm sorry , Grace ! I loved you so much ! I always will ! Goodbye , baby ! Goodbye !

 - the name 's Brogan , lieutenant Brogan . For 20 years , I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now ... Well , let 's just say " I 've transferred to another precinct . " - This is scavenger k38 . Outside quadrant seven , near the abandoned space platform . I got all the junk I need for the day . I 'm headed home . - All right- - He 's online . - Are you receiving me ? - Arrak , what have you got ? - Xanek , as promised . - Good . Who 's the contact ? - Oh , some lower echelon female exec with a suitcase full of money . - Nice work- - I 'm on way . - hmm . - Xanek intergalactic 's this is it , Lynn . - Once these guys are in , it 's only a matter of time . - You are pure genius , Reeve . - So what does that make me ? Don 't answer that . - You can be genius number two , Tong . - Mmm-hmm . - You all set ? - the key 's ready . Let 's go get those credits . - damn it , Tong ! When are you gonna realize that money is the root of the whole problem ? - Hey , I know- - I was just kidding . - Changing the system is no joke , Tong . - Scanners receiving loud and clear . Reeve , it 's time . - If anything doesn 't seem right , get out of there . What about the cops ? - Ah , routine patrol stuff . - You 're late . - Wasn 't easy to find . - Who 's the kid , arrak ? - You wanted to meet the main man . - You 're the supplier ? - World 's changing , lady . - Nice office . - Nice pen . All right- - Let 's get started . Uh , I gather arrak has told you about the advantages of this system ? - I wouldn 't be here if he hadn 't . - Well let 's see . Xanek intergalactic 's . And ? Your main competitor- - Vortex industries . - Hardly a secret . - How about this ? - So , vortex is going public . Hmm- - We suspected that . - Yeah , well now you know . With one of these keys , you can access any mainframe on the planet . I haven 't found a code I can 't crack yet . Whatever your business needs . - Not bad . I could do a lot of damage with one of these . - Whatever . - I assume cash will be acceptable ? - Well , that 's what it 's all about , isn 't it ? - Mind if I use your desk ? - Not at all . - I 'll need my pen back . - that 's sweet . - keep it . - All right- - we got ' em . Way to go , Janie . This is Brogan- - All units- - I repeat all units . We 're knockin off for dinner . - Haldane and Brogan calling in a cloak frequency , uh-uh . I don 't think so . - Reeve , go on in . - Yeah . - Well , I guess that 's everything . - It 's over- - You 're under arrest . Come on- - Cuff him . And read him his rights . - You have the right to remain silent- - - Okay , lieutenant- - We have a result . - Anything you say or think can be recorded . - Nice job . - You had us worried there for a second , castle . - Just another hard day at the Office . Thanks . Are you all right , Mr. Gushen . - Uh , fine , Officer- - I think . - All right- - I 'll meet you back at the station . Take him away . - Okay , let 's get back to the station . Well done , Officer castle . - great job , guys . - What do you think you 're doing ? - It 's over , Lynn- - Reeve 's gone . He 's not gone ! - He 'll talk . - Shut up- - He 'll never talk . Friends are everything . He 'd want us to continue the work . - Okay- - But without Reeve , what in deep space can we do ? - Get him back . - How ? - I don 't know . You 're genius number two . - Come on , haldane- - Where ? - Nope- - It 's a surprise . - I don 't like surprises . - too bad , castle . It 's my way or the highway . And you just keep your mind out of this . - Hey , what you guys get up to is none of my business . - Okay , I 'll take the highway . - What 's wrong with you ? - Maybe I 'm just tired of your games , haldane . - Okay- - Let 's , uh , get on with it . - Okay- - Let 's get started . - For the record , I 'm reminding you that anything you say or think can be recorded and may be used against you in a court of law . - Well , Reeve pataki , you 're in a lot of trouble here . - don 't you get it , cop ? You 're the one in trouble- - you . And your corrupt system . - We know this key will infiltrate closed mainframe systems . - No . - Apparently you designed it . - If you say so . - And were attempting to sell it to an undercover officer . - I was set up and you know it . - We already know that you 've sold several of these keys before . - We can do this two ways , Reeve . - We can charge you with systems espionage , mainframe trespass , industrial sabotage , illegal trading , and conspiracy to defraud . - Sweet . - No , not so sweet . The way the courts are today , you could get 40 years- - that a make you what ? About ready to collect your pension when you got out . - Or you cooperate . You dismantle your operation . Gives names of any or all of your associates . - Associates- - We 're not businessmen . We 're friends . - Who 's we ? - You 'll find out soon enough . - Oh . Anything ? - Yeah , the k.T.B. The Karol terac brigade . Terac was a Leader of a group of obstructionists in the early days of colonization . - Ah , let me guess . This terac character is some kind of spiritual guide for you and your so-Called friends . Ah , man . You know the longer you keep this up the deeper you 're gonna bury yourself . - Your father is Glenn pataki . - Oh , that impresses you . - Not particularly , but you obviously don 't need the money . Your father 's a very rich man . - Yes- - And he got that way by ripping off the working classes . People like you . So why 'd you do it ? - Do what ? - You sure we want to do this ? - There 's a lot more at stake here than just Reeve . - there it is- - The 88th precinct . - It 's nice to be surprised . - Not by Jack haldane . You remember last eclipse ? I spent a week 's salary on that outfit and where did we end up ? Magma wrestling in some Wolf district warehouse . - Says he never deals- - Not even for money . - Yeah , so why is he trying to sell this key thing ? - I don 't know . He thinks he 's some kind of intergalactic anarchist . - Yeah , well doesn 't everybody ? - Mmm- - You ever heard of Carol terac ? - Terac- - Terac ? Oh , yeah that , um , slam ball player that got nailed for shaving points . - Yeah , close . Terac was some kind of revolutionary . He 's a big hero to kids like pataki who think they 're gonna overturn the system . - I think I need to overturn him . - Nah , no we 'll just let him sweat it out in his cell for awhile . - Fire alert . Emergency personnel to level seven . - that 's us ! - Yeah , why does it always happen on our shift ! - Come on- - Come on . - Automatic sprinkler system failure . All elevator operations suspended . - Like taking Candy from a baby . - Come on ! Come on- - Come on ! Move it you guys- - Let 's go ! - Now for the adult part . - Would the officer on cell duty Please Prepare cell number four ? Cell number four for New prisoner arrival . - Yes ! - Okay , let 's go ! Come on- - Get movin ' in , guys . - Hey- - What 's goin ' on ? Open This door ! - Let 's hope that worked . - Have faith , Lynn . - long time no see , babe . You never call . - What kept you ? - No time for that now . Go down the hall to your left . Take the elevator to level one . Turn right toward the docking bay and get the hell out of there . - Love ya , Lynn . - Let 's go- - Let 's go ! Breathers ! Ready ? One ! Two ! Three- - Hit it ! - What 's goin ' on ? - I don 't know- - Where 's the fire ? - What fire ? - Fredo ? - Yes , lieutenant ? - Yeah , false alarm . Must have been a mainframe malfunction . - I 'll get slomo and Carson right on it , lieutenant . - Nice outfits , guys . - look who 's talkin ' ? - Hey- - The elevators are working . - Yeah , so ? - I 'm not sure . Let 's go check the cells out . - Hey , I 'm locked in here- - Come on , guys ! - Let him out . - Come on- - Open the door ! - Fredo , Seal the docking bays- - We got a runaway . Jane- - Took- - It 's Brogan . - What are you doing ? - It 's not me ! - Override it ! - I 'm trying ! - Come on , Reeve- - Where are you ? - Damn . Lynn , I 'm stuck in the docking bay . You got to get the doors open . - Reeve- - Lookout ! - Why do you think we left the cruiser door open , Reeve ? - Oh , mother . - Not exactly . You 're not as bright as you thought . - You will live to regret this , cop ! - I don 't believe this ! Do something ! - It doesn 't make any sense ! I 've tried every possible route . I can 't even get a connect ! - Why the hell not ? - Ah , I don 't know . Maybe the dumb cops figured out the one thing they could do to stop us from getting in . - What ? - They 've turned their darn system off . - Any change ? - He 's still not talking . - All right , people . Settle down- - Settle down . Lieutenant ? - Uh , I assume everybody 's seen this , uh , interoffice on the k.T.B. Outfit ? - Yeah , k.T.B. I saw it chalked up on the wall in the Gilmore district . I couldn 't figure out what it meant . - Well we know it means the Karol terac brigade . And obviously they 're trying to get Reeve pataki back . - Whoever these people are , they 're not stupid . Somehow they 've broken into our mainframe . That means you won 't be making or receiving ANY screen calls for the time being . - The good news is multi-Coms are still functional . They 're on a different system . - So , even if these kids are listening in , they won 't be able to access the mainframe . - The bad news is without satellite communications , we 've lost our collision warning systems . - So , we 're back to good old fashioned proximity sensors , which means everybody-- - Yes , good old fashioned watch shifts . Duty roster is posted in the main office . Do we have any information about the pataki kid 's confederates ? - Well since , um , Officer romek seems familiar with the urban guerilla scene , I thought I 'd put him and orrin on that . - Okay , people- - Let 's get to it . - We 've already seen the road to run late watch . - We better go straight off and get some rest . - Yeah , nice one . - It 's not my fault ! I only asked him a question ! - You and your big mouth . - Leave me alone ! - We have to keep asking ourselves . What would Reeve do ? - I don 't know , what would Reeve do ? - Tong , you 're a genius ! Are we back inside the system ? - Uh , no I 'm afraid not . I just downloaded a whole load of these cop files when we first logged on . Maybe there is something here we could use . - Wait a minute- - Are these personnel files ? - Yeah , it looks like it . - can you call up the female cops ? - Sure . - Stop there . Back one . That 's the one . That 's her . - What do you mean ? - I know what Reeve would do . - Stop asking me for advice . Like I said , what you and haldane do is none of my business . - Tooki . - if I tell you haldane 's no good for you , you argue with me . If I tell you haldane 's the greatest thing that has ever happened to you , you argue with me . I can 't win . - I was only asking you about a dress . - that 's not what you were asking me about , and you know it ! - Listen- - If I can 't talk to my flat mate , who can I talk to ? - I don 't mind it when you talk to me . What I do mind is whatever I say , you don 't want to hear it . - that 's not True- - I do listen . Go ahead- - Say something . - Okay . You should call up haldane , and tell him you love him . - Oh , that 's the most ridiculous thing I 've ever heard in my life . - I 'm going to the store . - Fine with me . - and do the dishes ! - And what if I don 't love him ? - Please . Come quietly . This thing generates over 2,000 volts . [ grunting ] - Freeze ! Isn 't that what you cops say ? Stand up . Stand up ! Now which position is " stun , " and Which is " Kill ? " - You know , I 've been thinking . You were right . If you can 't talk to your roommate , who can you talk to ? Janie ? Janie ? - Okay , Lynn- - Now you sit down . - Perfect . - Hey ! I am genius number two , remember ? - This came in five minutes ago . - It 's really very easy . The k.T.B. Don 't want to harm anyone , but we will if we have to . What we do want is a simple exchange . Reeve pataki for officer castle . We 'll contact you again at noon . - Did you manage to trace it ? - Yep . Came direct from castle 's multiphone . - I should 've been there . - It 's nobody 's fault , took . What do you think , Brogan ? - Well obviously we don 't know what they 're gonna do , but I mean I don 't think they 're gonna hurt her . They 're idealists , not murderers . - Come on , Brogan- - The world is full of idealists that have killed people . We got to make the trade , captain . - we can 't negotiate with terrorists , haldane . You know that . - these aren 't terrorists . These are a bunch kids playin ' at it . We make the trade now and take ' em down later . If word hit the streets that the 88th can be blackmailed , every cop in Demeter will be put at risk . All right . Dismissed . Took , I want you to go straight home . - But sir , I really think I- - - That 's an order . There 's nothing you can do right now . - Yeah . - You know your friends kidnapped a police officer . - Kidnapping , ooh- - That sounds serious . - listen to me you smug little punk ! - Haldane ! Kid 's father here to see him . - Sit down . - You know , you 're not helpin ' Jane any here . - What do you want me to do ? - Your job . - Son ? - Well , well . We live and learn . I didn 't know the devil made house calls . - You 're in a lot of trouble . - What 's the matter ? You worried about the bad publicity ? - actually I 'm worried about you . - Oh , is that a fact ? You 're only about 20 years too late . - All right . Here 's what we 're gonna do . First , I post bail and get you out of here . Then I get you the best lawyers money can buy . - Yeah , that 's right- - Just throw money at the problem . That 'll solve it for sure . - I am trying to help you , Reeve . All you have to do is tell them where your friends are ! - Never- - Friends are everything . I don 't want your money , old man ! Or your help ! - What have you become , Reeve ? - Your worst nightmare . I 'm the guy who 's gonna bring every big , fat cat capitalist in this galaxy to his knees . And if you go down with them , so much the better . - in that case , I can 't help you . - Looks like the ball 's is in your court , boys . That is if you want your friend back . - Time 's up- - Let 's get back online . - You got it . - of course we want officer castle back . But as I 've told you before , police policy categorically prohibits me from exchanging Hostages for prisoners . - Since when have cops cared about police procedure ? - In cases like this , there are no exceptions . - Well make one . - Well , that won 't be easy . I 'll have to call my superiors again . That 'll take time . - Well you better be quick , captain . Time 's running out . - So- - Call . - Hey , man he 's trying to buy us more time here . - Where the hell are orrin and romek ? - They 're stalling . The stupid , dumb cops are just buying their time . They 're probably tracking us down right now ! - We talked to the students , the professors , and the administrators this morning . - Two names kept popping ' up . Lynn dilfer and Tong coup . - They both quit college around the same time as Reeve . Nobody 's heard from them since . - As far as we know , all three were inseparable . - Who gave you the photos ? - The parents- - We went there after the college . - Yeah- - What 'd they say ? - Uh , neither family 's had any contact for almost a year . - Just like Reeve . - Yeah , great , so we still don 't have squat ! - The photos are somethin ' , haldane . I don 't know- - maybe we could give ' em to the media . Somebody 's bound to have seen ' em . - Oh , yeah- - That 's wonderful . They see their picture- - Panic , and start pullin the trigger . - enough ! Now listen . We 've got what they want- - Reeve pataki . They know for certain that we 're not gonna trade ' em for castle . Which means that the ball is in their court . - and what do we do- - Just sit around and wait ? - You 're through for the day , haldane ! Get out of here ! Don 't talk to me until you 're ready to make a worthwhile contribution to this case ! - My pleasure . - They 'll never find us here . - But what if Reeve does talk ? - We already discussed that , Lynn . You said it yourself . He 'll never talk . - Okay , then genius . So what would Reeve do now ? What was that ? - I don 't know . - You know you 're wasting your time . We modified the release mechanism . It only works from the outside . - In case we get tired of you . Not much fun being locked in a cell , is it ? Well you better get used to it . Seems like none of your friends want you back . That 's it ! - What ? - I just figured out what Reeve would do . Friends are everything . [ phone ringing ] - Officer took . - Yes , what do you want ? - Same as always . Our friend for yours . - Look , whoever you are , you 're wasting your time . There is nothing I can do . - that 's not True , Officer took . You can help your friend more than you think . Then I think it 's Only fitting that you decide whether She lives or dies . - What do you want me to do , Janie ? - Um , I 'm sorry , Matt . What 'd you say ? - Mom wants to know when you 're comin ' home , dad ? You 're startin ' to look kinda scruffy . - Where 's your mom ? - in the shower . - Uh , Matt , uh , tell her it 's gonna take as long as it takes . - She 's not gonna be happy . - Just do it , Matt . - Tooki , what are you doin ' here ? - How are you holdin ' up , took ? - Yeah , I 'm fine- - I feel fine . Any news ? - Uh , no . You know what we do . - Nothing . I have to go see podly . - I 'll talk to you later . - ' Kay . - I know it 's official policy not to negotiate with terrorists , sir . Just as I know it 's the right policy , but there 's an officer 's life at stake here . No , sir . Uh , of course not , sir . Yes- - Yes , I-I understand . Yes , sir . If you could , I-I would be most grateful . Thank you , sir . - Hey , took- - How you doin ' ? what brings you down here ? - Reeve pataki . We 're movin ' him out of the precinct . Security . Payport 's takin ' it 's time with the system being down and all . - Huh , tell me about it . - Captain wants me to pick him up anyway . - Ah , well- - Whatever the captain wants . The sooner we get his Butt out of here , the sooner things 'll get back to normal . - Yeah . - Moving me isn 't gonna solve any of your problems , you know . - Never mind that , just get going . - Wait a second , took . - Lieutenant . Captain wants me to move the prisoner to the 38th . He asked me to make the run . - Yeah , I know , but the plan 's have changed . - Oh , right . - Put him back in his cell- - We 'll be back in awhile . - Whatever you say , lieutenant . - that 's what I like about you guys . You 're so decisive . - talk to me , took . - They contacted me at home . Reeve 's friends . They said I had two hours to free ' em , or they 'll kill Jane . It was her last chance . - Why didn 't you tell us , tooki ? - You 'd've stopped me . You have stopped me . - She didn 't do it . Reeve isn 't coming . - We don 't know that . Give her time . - She 's out of time ! We told them we didn 't want to hurt anybody ! But these damn cops ! - Come on , Lynn- - Stop it ! We have to keep reminding ourselves . What would Reeve do ? - Don 't you tell me what Reeve would do ! I 'm in charge now . I 'll tell you what we 're gonna do . If we can 't have him back , then they sure as hell ain 't gonna have Officer damn castle back ! - What are you gonna do ? - Kill her . - You can 't do that , Lynn ! - What 's stopping me ? - Reeve . We haven 't exhausted all our options yet . - All right , captain podly . We 've tried all the easy , painless ways . But you 've made it complicated . You see , we really must have Reeve back . So , the escape pod , you can see , has been hermetically sealed . We 've disconnected the air supply . All in all , I 'd say officer castle has about an hour left . Either Reeve is released , or you can just sit there and watch your friend die of suffocation . The choice is yours . - damn it , I 've had enough ! - Where are you going , haldane ? Come back here- - Go after him ! - Haldane . - They 're on the old communications platform outside quadrant seven . Don 't ask . - What 's this on the scanner , Tong ? - Relax . It 's just another scavenger . - Scavenger k38 . We 're all set here . [ gasping ] - See- - It 's moving off . Better be quick ! - How long do you think she 's got ? - It 's already too late . We gotta stop this , Lynn . - What are you gonna do ? - Turn the air back on . - No you 're not . - We 're not murderers , Lynn . - and we 're not friends anymore . - No , please- - No- - No ! - Freeze- - police ! - Drop the gun- - Drop it ! - Where 's officer castle ? - You 're too late , officers . Your friend 's already dead . - Janie- - Come on ! Come on , Janie- - don 't do this . Janie ! I need you ! Janie , I can 't live without you- - Janie ! Janie , come on- - Come on ! Okay- - It 's all right . - Okay , lieutenant- - We 're back online . - Everybody hear that ? - Yeah . - Yeah . - All right- - back to work . - What pop 's doin ' here ? - the kid 's got a preliminary hearing in court today . - Reeve ? I set up that meeting for you with the lawyers . The ones that specialize in this sort of stuff . I thought that- - When This is over- - - I never meant for anyone to get hurt . I just want you to know that . - Come on- - Let 's go . - You know , sometimes I forget . - What do you mean ? - What a hell of a responsibility it is being a parent . Your kids are born . You make choices . You do the best you can , but in the end all you can really do is just sit back and hope for the best . - Officer haldane ? - Slomo ! You about ready ? - Willing and able , Officer haldane . - All right- - Give me five minutes . - All right- - I 'm ready to go . - Relax . - I 'm okay . - I want to keep you under observation for at least 26 hours . - Carson , I 'm fine . - Humor me . - Jane , when are you going to start listening to good advice . - I 'm listening . - See you later . - Okay , this is what I think you should do . - Uh , I 'm not listening . - Castle ? What 's this I hear about you missin ' our date ? - You know what I think you should do . I 'll see you later . - Bye . - Sorry about the date , Jack . Blame Carson . - Yeah , oh well . You know , let me , uh , let me ask you somethin ' . did you , by any chance , happen to hear anything I was saying last night when you were comin ' around ? - Why- - Did you say something interesting ? - Nothin ' , really . [ speaking foreign language ] - Mademoiselle , if you would be so kind as to peruse the menu , I 'm happy to take your order . I can recommend the simple squash today , and the arkin 's are particularly sweet . - Thank you , slomo . - Well , can 't take Mohammed to the magma wrestling . - Haldane ! Mmmm . - What ? - Every word . - What do you mean ? - I heard every word you said last night . - ugh . You did ? - Mmm-Hmm .

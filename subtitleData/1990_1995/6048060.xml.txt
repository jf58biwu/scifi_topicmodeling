 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ music playing ] I 've seen a thousand of these , Miss Payton . What is so special about this one ? I just wanna know what 's in it , that 's all . I can tell you that right now . It 's called snake oil . They used to sell this stuff at traveling medicine shows . It 's probably just colored water mixed with alcohol . No , this is more than that . I found these in the attic with the bottles . They 're incredible testimonials . The elixir 's supposed to give enormous strength to anyone who drinks it . And this , it 's my great-grandfather 's diary . I think you should look at it . We have a number of agents who would be delighted to do just that . I am on my way out . I 've already spoken to an agent . He said you 're the only one who could authorize lab work . Can I ask you why this is so urgent ? You told me this bottle has been in your great-grandfather 's attic for a hundred years . Surely another day or two won 't matter . Or will it ? No , I guess it won 't . Good . But you are going to have it tested , aren 't you ? I 'll drop it off at the lab on my way home . Read and report . Good night , everyone . Where 's he off to in such a hurry ? He 's a civil servant and it 's 5 : 00 . You 'll figure it out . [ jazz music playing ] Nice car . You like it ? Practically restored it by hand . Spent more than I should , but it 's worth it . Yeah , my grandfather had one just like it . [ tires screech ] Please get me out . I 'm trying . I 'm gonna go get some help . Wait , wait ! [ Jackson growls ] You got out of there . Why didn 't you help me ? - I tried . - Like hell you did . Hi , boys . Gino , good morning . Good morning . No , no , keep the change , Eddie . Morning . [ laughs ] Good morning . Kent , Miss Lang . My , what a lovely outfit . Thank you . Well , that was weird . Why , is there something wrong with my outfit ? Dennis , are you OK ? Fine , never been better . Are you sure ? I just got this call ... - Look , there 's a mouse . - [ woman screams ] What 's going on ? It 's another mouse . Ever since the renovation started , the place has been overrun by ' em . Think maybe it 's time to call an exterminator ? No . What , kill the cute little devils ? No . No , no , take ' em out back to that field . Let him be with his family . [ laughs ] Now that 's weird . Dennis , the police called . Said you were in an accident last night . I know . I spoke to them this morning . It was no big deal . No big deal ? There was a fight at the scene and then you disappeared . Must have been a little dazed . I 'm fine now . And your car ? It was totaled . It was falling apart anyway . You loved that car . It 's just a hunk of metal . The important thing is no one was killed right ? Well , sure , but you seem to be taking it well . Why not ? Life is too short . Whatever you say . Wait a second . - Where you headed ? - The usual . Some woman saw a UFO and wants to tell us all about it . You never know . You never know . The universe is filled with the mystery and the wonder of marvelous things . Are you sure you 're OK ? Of course . You know , I have been thinking about this . I haven 't been out in the field for months . I 'm going out with you . [ woman ] I 'm a singer at the Melody Maker down on Beakman . I sing country music . Mm-hmm . Now what exactly did you see ? Well , I saw three round lights and they passed right overhead . And I was on my way to the car and it was about 2 : 00 in the morning . Three round lights ? That 's it ? Well , they sort of hovered there and then they just took off . Right . So have you been doing this long ? Actually , I 'm the bureau chief . I don 't usually go out into the field . The take charge kind . I don 't know about that . No , I sensed that about you . It 's very becoming . Oh , well , thank you . Where are my manners ? I should get us some refreshments . You want me to leave ? What do you mean ? Come on , Dennis , it 's obvious . She 's interested in you . What ? Nothing wrong with that . I could leave and you two could get to know each other a little better . What are you talking about ? This is an official bureau investigation . It 's OK . Stay and ask her out . Or at least wait until she asks you . Think she 'd do that ? Where you going ? She 's gonna ... Where 's your friend ? He asked me to apologize . He had to get back to the office . This account says that minutes after taking his own medicine , Professor Payton could lift a wagon over his head . Sound like anyone we know ? Hulk Hogan ? I was thinking more along the lines of Superboy . What if there 's some connection ? I don 't know about that . But if this diary 's any indication , Payton was a sick man . Why 's that ? Because it sounds like two different people we 're writing it . even though the handwriting 's the same . One 's really angry and the other 's kind of gentle . You 're too uptight , Dennis . Go down to that club and have a drink with Elissa . Now what do you got to lose ? Only the chance to humiliate myself again . Just be a little more aggressive . Women like that . [ knocks ] What are you doing here ? The lab 's findings were inconclusive . They need another sample . You do have another bottle . Of course . Come in . I 'll be anxious to hear the results . It will be soon , won 't it ? Well , if I can get it there this time . We should hear shortly . I thought you said their findings were inconclusive . Yes , of course . That 's what I meant . It 's been a long day . Sure . No . I understand . Thanks for this . When I hear , I 'll call you . [ audience cheering ] Dennis , what are you doing here ? I 'm here because you want me here . You made that very clear this morning . Hey , are you drunk or something ? What 's wrong ? You were interested this morning . Well , the guy I was interested in was a gentleman . Yeah , well , I 'm sick to death of being a gentleman . [ Jackson ] You can 't hide from me ! Come on , Elissa . Just let me see you . I won 't hurt you . I just wanna be with you . I know you 're out here . Come on out , Elissa . Daddy 's home ! [ screams ] Good morning , all . How 'd the Knicks do last night ? Could I borrow this for a second ? - I 'll bring it right back . - Sure Matt , my boy . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? Hard to work on a day like this . Did you go see Elissa last night ? Yes . Well , actually , I got to the club 's front door , and then I guess I kind of chickened out . The rest of the night was just kind of lost . Kind of lost ? Well , I had a couple of drinks and went home . Why do you ask ? Have you seen this ? If you wanna talk later . He hasn 't come out of there all day long . He 's about to . Oh , yeah ? 5 : 00 . You guys still working ? Why don 't you take off ? We 're about to . Matt 's taking us out for dinner . Good . Well , bon appetit . Mr. Jackson , phone call . Get a message , Doug . I 'll take care of it in the morning . It 's a Gail Payton . I 'll take it in my office . This is Dennis Jackson . [ Miss Payton ] I saw you last night with that woman who was killed . That does it . Enough is enough . One word- - mouse traps . Mr. Jackson won 't be too happy about that . These days he 's happy about everything , if you haven 't noticed . - Dennis , are you all right ? - Fine . Dinner 's gonna have to wait . I 'm sorry . Miss Payton . Miss Payton . Gail . Gail , are you here ? [ grunts ] [ coughs ] [ panting ] I 've been waiting for you . [ laughs ] [ footsteps ] Dennis . What 's happened to you ? I found a way to get everything I ever wanted out of life never worrying about what people think of me . I 'm free . We need to get you to a doctor . I 've got other plans . Dennis , please , don 't do this . You 're taking it , too . How could I resist ? With all it offers . Strength , power , freedom from inhibitions . Why did you bring it to me ? That wasn 't me . The person who brought it to you was scared . She wanted to get away from it . But that person is gone . I killed her . Like the others . The others ? The woman at the convention center . That singer you wanted . You did that ! Why ? Because I wanted to . Can you think of a better reason to do anything ? [ laughs ] That 's the ultimate power . Life and death . Do it . He 's the only one who knows about us . Go on . Kill him . What 's wrong ? Maybe you need some more of the elixir . No . I 've had enough . Enough to know that I was wrong . I wanted what the elixir gave to me . I wanted it badly , but not badly enough to let myself become what you 've become . It looks as if I was wrong about you . Some people can 't ever stop being weak . So do you think Jackson 's gonna be all right ? I 'm sure he 'll be back to normal in no time . And I think it 's best that we keep what happened among ourselves . For crying out loud , will somebody get an exterminator ? Yep , no time at all . [ laughing ] [ music playing ]

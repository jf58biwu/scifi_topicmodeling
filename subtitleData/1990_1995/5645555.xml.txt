I mean you 're not going to make that dinner tonight . why not ? [ sighs ] this day is repeating . the time bounce has happened . right after work at 6 : 15 you go across the street to buy flowers , and you 're ... shot . I 've already seen it . people are saying the same things they said yesterday . they 're doing the same things . the news has the same story . it 's all happening again the same way . prove it . point something out . o.k. oh . oh . ah-choo ! I haven 't been paying attention . I 'll make it easier . what do I do next ? [ beeper sounds ] your beeper goes off , and you leave .

[ lisa ] looks like it 's contained. just in that one seal . [ dr. moxley ] just one seal ... [ lisa ] this means we can 't shut the accelerator down today . [ denk ] we have no choice . the accelerator has to be fully operational until this is under control . if one more seal had broken , we would have irradiated the entire lab . I don 't understand what happened . it 's a terrible embarrassment . we tell him it 's safe , and now we can 't dismantle the core for two weeks . I ' get a cleanup crew . I 'm sorry , thadius . it 's not your fault , lisa . for 40 years something 's gone wrong with every project I 've worked on . well , you 're bound for a change , then . maybe the next project will hit . this is the last project I 'll supervise . the way the press is handling this ... I can 't take any further disappointments . you check the other seals . no cleanup until 10 a.m. tomorrow . I 'll check those other seals and structures . I 'll examine them . I 'll determine what happened . she 'll do it . thadius , it 's my job . one more seal breaks , we 'll be reading at night by our own glow . this is my department . I want her to do it ! I 've been with this project since the beginning . you 've caused enough problems . how did you get in here ? I want security down here immediately . take those files to level three .

[ thunder ] this day 's about to repeat . no kidding. they 're all about the same around here . oh , my god . but what if it doesn 't ? I want another chance ! no more chances , man . you 're doing time now . the time is 7 : 35 . o.k. today I save her . well , look who decided to show up . you 're right. if I wanted to be on time , I would . I 'll finish the personnel reports , complete the monthly billing , and clean off my desk by quitting time . you don 't want to fight or be my friend . so why kick me out when I 'm so damn cute ? mm-hmm . howard . what ? get rid of that stain . that 's good work , man . you almost prevented her from talking entirely . you don 't remember a thing about yesterday , do you ? we had some drinks . I picked up the blonde after you left . she blew you off. you went home. you watched batman . you won 't believe me , so just trust me . I need to talk to dr. moxley . he 'll be here in 30 seconds . first I have to talk to lisa . when moxley gets here , keep him here. got it ? dr. moxley 's coming here . how do you know that ? trust me . I know . [ zap ] jack ! lisa ! the time bounce ... yes ? is a fascinating theory , don 't you think ? who are you ? I 'm barry ... thomas . you seem to know both our names very well . I don 't mean to sound forward , but I 'm having lunch in the cafeteria at 12 : 30 . I hate meeting new , interesting , attractive people . I 'd rather eat alone , but if we have to , isn 't it better to discuss how wonderful theory is and how disappointing the physical world can be ? that 's quite a qualified pickup line . I 've been working on it for two days now . enjoy your very nice morning . 12 : 30. don 't forget . who 's that ? I have no idea . cigarette ? she doesn 't smoke . you 've worked here , what , four years ? pay attention . how 'd you know about moxley ? moxley was already here ? you made me look like an idiot . you 're off of technical staff .

I saw some coolant studies in the lab . they look like yours . I thought I brought them all back . I 'm sorry I snapped . it 's not about you . forget it . marilyn , do you have those papers ? this afternoon soon enough ? yeah , fine . thank you . [ scraping ] shut up . I believe you wanted the string beans . they 're quite excellent today . you are a very unusual person . what do you do again ?

I told her I had a lunch date . this is very weird . look , you 're a scientist . let 's talk theory . the time bounce must have hap- - oh , excuse me , dr. fredericks . I 've just had a complaint that mr. thomas was seen in your office this morning . what ?

I made a time map- - what were you doing in wing b ? you go across the street and buy flowers and- - you 're killed. you 're shot . I 've seen it twice now . you 're fired. one hour to clean out your desk . you 're fired. get out . goodbye . your beeper 's about to go off . ohh ... dr. fredericks , I am so sorry . oh . well ... what a disappointment . actually , I didn 't hire him . he was here when I came .

I woke up . it was the same day . you 're missing something . you drove through something unusual . you were near metal or a chemical or hit by lightning . I collapsed in bed , my clock said 12 : 01 , and I got a shock . my lamp was broken . there were loose wires . I tried to fix it , but I lit up like a christmas tree . and then ? then ... it was morning . there 's a theory- - scott 's theory has a corollary that says consciousness exists separate from the time bounce . you could 've gotten that bad shock when the first bounce happened . it pushed you out of the loop just enough so you can remember . I bet that 's it ! lucky me . barry , I 'm--I 'm sorry . no , no. it 's ... I mean , you saved my life . self-interest . I ... I 've been watching you out of my office for such a long time . the other day , I gathered up the nerve to actually speak to you . I made a fool out of myself . but I thought , hey , I 'll have another chance to speak to you someday . but then you ... well ... we spoke ? yeah . yeah , we did . how was I ? great . you were very nice . you threw me out of your office . I 'm sorry . I guess I was having a bad day . that next morning when I saw you ... alive ... I realized I had a second chance- - a chance to save you . I 'm sorry . hey , hey . I 'm not going to let you die again . hi . hi . you know , I 'm usually not this type of guy . I 'm supposed to say that . what time is it ? oh , my god . it 's 12 : 00 . we 've got to do something . there 's no time . quick. tell me what your favorite color is . what ? what 's your favorite color ? green . favorite food . smoked oysters . favorite number . 37.1 . favorite music . that 's hard . tell me . what is it ? the carpenters . the carpenters . you got to be kidding . [ thunder ] lisa ... I love you . [ beep beep ] the time is 7 : 35 . please wake up . [ click ] 9 : 17--lisa 's in corridor with denk . lights cigarette . [ telephone rings ] 9 : 25--denk goes through lisa 's office . 12 : 30--lunch with lisa . mom , I 'll call you back . the day 's repeating . 1 : 00--lisa 's beeper goes off . 1 : 40- - you 're pathetic. that 's not how you throw the ball . what 's wrong with you ? [ tires screech ] well , look who decided to show up . don 't get your panties in a bunch . if you left us alone , the work could get done , but you 're so invasive that no one can concentrate . stop assuming we 're all idiots and don 't judge people by how cute they are . well ... this is what I get for covering for you all these years . thank you . it might be time to look into your performance record . you do that . well , nice knowing you , barry . excuse me. barry . lisa . I 'm a little confused . how do you know me ? I know you like it compact without the crap , so here we go . it 'll sound impossible , but I 'll support it with facts . the time bounce has happened . we 've met before- - three times . your favorite food is oysters . your favorite number is 37.1 . your favorite music is the carpenters , even though you could do better . denk has been illegally firing the accelerator . you 'll transfer that proof onto a computer disk . here 's where it gets a little sticky . I 've seen you shot , twice now . but yesterday I was able to save you . but the time bounce happens , and I wind up here , memory intact . I 'm the only one who remembers anything around here . I made you a time map . sit back and watch the day unfold . it 's 9 : 15 now . lisa ? thadius . barry thomas ? yes . I 've gotten your memos . you , too , lisa. are we all losing assistants ? actually , I- - you 're two assistants are back on the computer . they 'll have their passes back by lunchtime . dr. fredericks explained the whole thing to me . I appreciate that , lisa . dr. moxley , you look great on tv . ann , dr. moxley 's a very busy man . he doesn 't have the time to listen to you suck up . it 's sad . if you ever have a problem , come to me personally , not to my low-level staff . everything seems to be under control . thank you , lisa . I 'll see you at the 9 : 30 . good day . good day . howard ! look. over there . see that ? he 's about to light his cigarette . he 's met you in the hallway these past mornings . today he can 't because you 're here with me . keep denk from finding out about the computer disk . today I 'll take all the information . I ... can 't just accept this . the epitaph on your canary 's grave you made when you were 9 years old was on a paper plate , and it said , " fly to heaven . " [ beep beep ] [ beep beep ] [ beep beep ] oh , my god . [ telephone rings ] personnel . oh , yes , sir . why , yes , they are . excuse me ? o.k. I don 't think so . you trust me . you may not realize it yet , but you trust me . now , let 's meet out by the front entrance in a half-hour . o.k. big daddy , that was great . how did you do that ? barry , I want you in my office immediately . relax , ann . I 'm quitting . something I should 've done a long time ago . no , no , no , barry . dr. moxley just called . you 're under arrest . well , what for ? for stealing classified computer information . come this way , please . hey. howard- - marital status . single . and occupation . I don 't know . what time is it ? just put down unemployed . at least it 's not murder this time , right ? social security number . really , you should learn to type . we may be doing this for years . well , I could always start again in six hours . hello. how are you ? thomas. you made bail . you guys got nothing on me . it 's a bum beef . hey. there are second chances . yes , sir . that 'll be fine . how did you get the bail ? don 't even ask why I 'm doing this . I don 't even know her . you 're not killed today ! that 's great news ! barry , um ... look , we ... you really like me a lot . you just can 't remember it . I 'd love to stick around , but that would be a lie . barry , call me when your insanity clears up . close the door . get in . I don 't mean to be realistic about this or anything , but shouldn 't we call a professional to take care of this ? howard ... look , we got to think of something . he 's going to fire that thing tonight . the police kept the computer disk . then the police will take care of it . it 's out of their jurisdiction , and we don 't have proof . is there any way to get back into that building ? yeah , I think so . yeah . the accelerator needs a two-hour warm-up period before it can fire . that means he 'd start it , uh , in three hours . if we have security tape the lab through their surveillance cameras , we could get the proof we need to stop them . pay the lady . I don 't have any money . we had a lot more fun last night . we did ? we took a walk in the woods , we sat by a fire . we sat by a fire ? yeah . are you saying that you--that we- - I mean , did you get lucky ? oh , my god , you got lucky . you got lucky , too . it wasn 't just me . this is so strange . I know , but it was also tremendous . the earth moved . ohh ! want to step in the alley , please ? let 's go. you , too . move . over there . these are the guys that have been killing you . where are the other disks ? who are you ? shut up . why don 't you just leave- - listen to the question- - did you make any more disks ? I 'm not really a part of this . shut up . there 's no reason to have me here . shut up ! there are no other disks . barry , tell them I don 't have anything to do with this . any information I have would be useless . I don 't know anything . oh , my god ! hurry up ! [ pounding on door ] help ! check down there . I 'm sorry about your friend , barry . I know you cared about him . that 's funny . he said the same thing to me when you were killed . nothing . what ? I didn 't leave a light on . lisa ... thadius is in that house . what ? sorry I wasn 't able to tell you this before , but six months ago , the justice department asked me to help them investigate thadius . why are you investigating thadius ? they suspected he 'd broken safety regulations trying to get the accelerator up and running on budget . what ? he broke those seals to stop the dismantling . moxley broke those seals ? that 's right . we don 't know what else he might do . we better talk to him . I don 't think so . I 'm going to need you as material witnesses . shall we ? o.k. [ door opens ] thadius , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry , thadius . it 's over . thank god , lisa , you 're all right . thadius . robert , you 're not going to fire that accelerator tonight . what are you talking about ? your name is in the computers authorizing the firing sequence for tonight . that 's impossible . dr. moxley , why are you in my house ? I 'd hoped to find another disk with the proof against him . he crashed the mainframe computer before I could retrieve anything . he 's lying . who were you waiting for ? who were those two men in the truck ? hello , ted ? where the hell are your men ? who are you talking to ? don 't move ! I 'm just , uh , taking off my coat , o.k. ? [ gunshot ] thank god you made the right choice . he set me up . don 't you understand ? the accelerator is going to be a $ 50 billion industry in five years . he doesn 't care about you ! thadius , you said- - I said what I had to . sometimes you do what 's wrong to do what 's right . I 'm sorry . no ! oh ! I truly am sorry . the time is 7 : 35 . please wake up . you bastard . what kind of man are you ? I can 't believe it . you shot her and him- - and me in cold blood ! that 's it , pal . you 're finished . no more hamster wheel for me , you slimy ... [ honking ] ohh ! the time is 7 : 35 . please wake up . [ beep beep ] please wake- - this cutting edge project by researchers in particle physics has been shut down by government order. hosea ? mary , big news at utrel corporation . researchers here working on particle physics believe they 've discovered a way to accelerate- - [ ring ] [ ring ] hi , mom . no , we haven 't spoken in a while . yes , I have met a girl . I just don 't think it 's going to work out . tell me , mom. what ? what 's all that matters ? yeah ? all that matters is how it feels ? it does . it ... it feels right . yeah , you said it . nothing good comes easy . mom , I 'm--I 'm running late , but I promise I 'll call you later , o.k. ? I love you , too . bye , mom . you 're pathetic . that 's not how you throw the ball . what 's wrong with you ? treat them with respect . they are human beings . you know , you 're not such a bad guy when you get to know you . what the hell are you doing ? I know who you are . you 're helping the justice department catch moxley . I want to blow him out of the water . you want to help ? morning . morning . come in . robert , what is this ? I 've got a report . you , uh ... you better sit down . barry here has something to tell you . the time bounce has happened . excuse me ? the time bounce . we 're in it . the earth has stopped as we know it . children don 't grow up , people don 't stay dead , we 'll never have another holiday , and you 'll never see another flower bloom . what are you talking about ? and I 've fallen in love with a beautiful young lady , and , so far , I could only see her for a few hours , and it breaks my heart to meet her every morning a stranger . see , I want her every day . I want her to grow old with me . that 's why life is so precious- - because time passes . who is this ... who 's this girl ? 37.1 ... oysters . green . the carpenters ... fly to heaven . all right , look . we play the day as normal . when he goes to warm up the accelerator tonight , I 'll call for backup , you two will be out . if I wake up tomorrow , and it 's today , I 'll kill myself . look who decided to show up . I am robert denk . this is dr. fredericks . I knew that . what a pleasure it is- - we need more men like barry . he 's an excellent worker . treat him accordingly . sorry ? barry , I 'd like that evaluation report of miss jackson on my desk by noon . evaluation ? we are like this . hey ! howard , you 're alive . I wasn 't in the bathroom that long , was I ? ohh ! sorry , sorry . careful , guys . oh ! ohh ! oh , jack , I 'm so sorry . this is a terrible embarrassment for me . we told them we 're safe , and now we can 't dismantle the core for two weeks . no one was hurt . the radiation 's contained in the core . I think people understand . better double-check on those seals . thank you , lisa . thadius , I take full responsibility . I 'll get a cleanup crew , and I 'll deal with the press immediately . well ... I admire your attitudes . dr. moxley ? no disturbances . thank you . I know an individual who really loves red roses . may I ? señorita . hi , reynaldo . I got it . really ? yeah . it 's my pleasure .

I 've died for you already . I got to get used to this . it 'll work out , you know ? it already has . and now for the local news . a man identified as robert denk , a research scientist at utrel corporation , was found murdered this evening . the victim was discovered ... moxley hasn 't changed the codes . is that good or bad ? I don 't know . dr. fredericks ? yes . you must be barry thomas. hello . I have to ask you to step inside . you 're wanted in connection with dr. denk 's murder . dr. moxley 's orders . listen , fellas , it has been a really tough week . it has been all tuesdays . sir- - I 've already been killed today . sir , I understand . stop giving me a hard time . I 'm going to have to make sure you 're fired . don 't think I can 't . I 'm in personnel . [ alarm sounds ] please give her the gun. please . you guys don 't seem to get it . I wake up every morning clutching the pillow , and it 's not lisa , and jack still gets hit with the coffee . so I 'm afraid you 're going to have to step inside . go--now--move it- - 1 , 2 , 3 , let 's go . so much for the surprise visit . [ beeping ] how about a little something special at 11 : 59 ? o.k. hold it . give me the gun . thadius , you can 't fire the accelerator . why are you trying to stop me ? the time bounce has happened . what they 're asking me to do is wrong . the time bounce , it 's real . go ahead . 15 years ago , they stopped work on my superconductor . 10 years to design a phase-gravitational field . the germans beat me by a month . now they 're going to dismantle my accelerator before it has a chance- - it doesn 't work ! I have no more time . thadius , it doesn 't work . get up there . go on . go on . is there an abort switch on that thing ? there 's a yellow button . please don 't . barry ! are you o.k. ? oh , my god . ahh ! that 's all right . hey , doc , tomorrow I may shoot you first . I 'll just keep coming back till I get it right . [ alarm sounds ] got you a little surprise , doc . warning--power fluctuation now at 30 % . did it abort ? no . any way to stop it ? no. he disconnected it . damn it ! damn it , get away from there ! no ! aah !

[ beep ] it 's wednesday . it 's wednesday . don 't move ! don 't move ! yes , sir . this man 's been shot . call an ambulance . who are you ? I 'm dr. fredericks . dr. moxley tried to fire the accelerator illegally . he tried to kill us . that 's not what we were told . you 're under arrest . we have proof ! put the cuffs on them . read them their rights . we 're under arrest . how about that ? we 're under arrest . every minute will be brand-new . we 'll never know what will happen next . I know what will happen next . you do ?

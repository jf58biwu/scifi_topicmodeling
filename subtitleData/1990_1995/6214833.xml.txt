 Rather disheartening , isn 't it , Mister President ? All those taxpayer dollars poured into hardware , and look where it gets you . You might as well have been feeding the hungry . Yours will be my fourth conquered world . Don 't count on it , Suitor . But I already have . Some wine ? I do wish you 'd face facts and tell your people to surrender . No ! I will not ask my people to give up everything they know to serve a sadistic , egotistical , homicidal maniac ! I don 't think of myself as egotistical . Proud maybe , but ... - General Suitor , - General Suitor . Intruder , level five ! Ramsey ! Goin ' up ? Let me give you a hand . Goin ' down ? Really Shep , from you I had expected something much better . Stop ! He 's mine . It 's been nice knowing you , Shep . There 'll be others . Goody , goody . Hashina , run ! Run ! Negotiations have ended ! Bye , now . Intruder on level two . Come on ! Level out . Stabilize . Stick with me ! Come on . Come on . Yes . Yeah . Atta boy . Excellent work , Ramsey . The Chyutt system can now live without threat of annihilation by General Suitor . Millions are in your debt . Great . So what 's next ? Well , actually , with the evil general out of the way , things are pretty quiet out there . You gotta have something on your books . Maybe a terrorist extermination ? No . Galactic narc duty ? Uh-uh . Okay , how about a big bug hunt with creatures that bleed acid ? Eh , listen , Shep . Um . I don 't know how to say this , but , lately , well , you haven 't been quite the old Ramsey . For instance , the old Ramsey would never have let President Hashina get killed . Now wait a minute ! Th-that 's all right . That 's fine . I 'm , I 'm not blaming you . Not your fault . Simply that you 've been working too hard . And anyone in your position would be a little stressed out . I 'm not stressed out ! Shep . Shep , what have you done ? Uh , nothing . Oh , yes , you have . You have blown your power console . Now this is what you 'll do . You 'll land , lay low , find a power source , use your transformer and recharge no higher than .01 percent . Anything more than that would be traceable . Point-oh-one percent ? It 'll take me six weeks to recharge . What am I gonna do for six weeks ? Why don 't you try ... relaxing ? Disappear , Shep . Blend in . Get to know the locals . But I just ... Consider it an order , Ramsey . Six weeks . What am I gonna do for six weeks ? Huh . Oh , no . Earthlings . I hate Earthlings . ¶ If the man in the moon Looked out on this place ¶ ¶ Yeah this bailess thing We say face to face ¶ ¶ Look here It 's my crib my friend ¶ ¶ Pretend you don 't care ¶ ¶ But you 'd rather be here Than there ¶ ¶ Here you shop till you drop ¶ Dad ? Come on in , honey . Mom says to tell you to go to work . Geez , Dad , get a grip . Tell your mom I 'll be right in . Okay . ¶ It 's a nice place to live ¶ ¶ But I wouldn 't Want to visit ¶ ¶ Such a nice place to live ¶ ¶ Nah ¶ ¶ It 's a nice place to live ¶ ¶ But I wouldn 't Want to visit ¶ ¶ Such a nice place to live ¶ ¶ Na na na ¶ ¶ Get ready to party ¶ ¶ That 's what I 'm saying Get up , get your body swaying ¶ ¶ Madonna , lambada ¶ So dogs If you wanna be there ¶ ¶ Yo , it ain 't what you are It 's what you wear ¶ Oh , Charlie , good , we got to talk . How are we gonna pay all these bills ? Charlie ! I am serious . You 've got to ask for that raise . Oh , now honey , it 's just not that simple . If I ask for it and I don 't get it , where does that leave us ? If I march in there and demand it , I might find myself without a job . Oh , honey , you always play it so safe . I mean , once in a while you just got to get up enough confidence and take a chance . That 's not fair . I play it safe for you and the kids . If it wasn 't for that ... I can be daring when I want to be . So can I. Charlie , say it . I will ask for a raise today , honey . Thanks , honey . ¶ Such a nice place to live ¶ ¶ Na na na ¶ I 'm here to ask for a raise ! I 'm tired of busting my butt for this company , only to be passed over when promotions are being handed out ! I deserve to be recognized . Sounds good to me , Wilcox . Now all you have to do is have the cojones to say it to your boss instead of his secretary . Charlie , hey . How are you ? I 'm doing fine , sir . And how 's that lovely wife , Julie ? Jenny . You 're right . And two great kids . Mark , nine . Theresa , twelve . Yeah , they 're just ... Eh-eh-eh-eh . Still allergic to tuna ? Oh , yes , I suppose I am . I know . Come on , who knows you better than I do ? You 're thinking to yourself , " How does he care so much ? How does he care to check ? " I 'll tell you how . People , Charlie . People caring about people . People giving to other people . That 's the way I choose to live . Not being a taker . What are those , the blueprints ? Oh , yeah . Oh , Charlie , yes . Yes . Ha ! These are adequate . Adequate ? Yes . I spent the entire weekend on them . Really ? I went sailing . I solved all the design problems . Uh-huh . I recalculated the specs . Yes . I reinforced the foundations . Yes , I see that . I even added a French arch . Makes the entrance pop out dynamically . Yes , yes , it does . Did I tell you I spent the entire weekend on this ? Did I tell you I spent the entire weekend with an incredible blonde ? What I 'm trying to say ... I know what you 're trying to say . Come on , Charlie . You had a stink-o weekend . That 's because you 're different from those other draftsmen out there . You know the type . Hogging the limelight , sucking the money , never giving , always taking . Charlie , Charlie , look at me . Be with me now . Come on now . Come on , boy . You know you 're different . And lucky , too . You know why . Come on , you know why . Sweating the details , making the deadline . Come on . Living the dream , Charlie , that 's what counts . You realize I envy you . Here 's the thing . I have to give myself a little credit for discovering your talent , which is why I 'd like to show you something a little special right now . Beautiful , aren 't they ? Not a single internal blemish in any of them . Do you know why ? I 'll tell you why . Pure Cymian crystal . These awards are my proudest possessions . I really believe , someday between your talent , maybe a little help from me , you 're gonna find your own name on one of those . Believe me , that 'll be worth more than all the money in China . Tea . What ? Tea in China . You 're a detail man , Charlie . That 's why I like you . And , by the way , that 's why my door is always open to you . 'Course , I suppose that we 've both got our work to do . So if there 's nothing else right now ... No , sir . Splendid . Oh , look who 's here . Welcome . Konichiwa . Konichiwa . Just trying to rival that celebrated Japanese sense of employee relations you people are born with , or so it seems . Uh , Mister Zukaki says he 's very impressed with your knowledge of his culture . Details , gentlemen . Details . That 's why you 're going to like my redesign of your plans . Worked all weekend on them . Even added a French arch . Seems to make the entrance just pop out , don 't you think ? Strike out ? I didn 't even get up to bat . ¶ Ooh , ah ¶ ¶ Whoo ¶ ¶ Do you wanna go party ¶ ¶ We 'll get funky there Party ¶ ¶ Drink a little wine Party ¶ Earthlings . ¶ Have a funky time ... ¶ Now where did I put that transformer ? Come on , move it ! Move it ! Let 's go ! Damn it ! Move that heap ! ¶ Blue sky Plenty of sunshine ¶ ¶ Take a stroll Down by the bay ¶ ¶ Where else Could there ever be ¶ ¶ Such a sensational hideaway ¶ What do you think you are doing ? Huh ? What are you doing here ? What are you , huh ? You 're unbelievable ! ¶ Hey now , hey now Like heaven on earth ¶ Check him out ! ¶ It 's almost like paradise ¶ Wow . Did you see that guy ? Uh-huh . ¶ Take this beautiful morning ¶ ¶ All the natives They laugh and play ¶ Give me back my money ! Excuse me . Oh ! There . Oh , great ! Thank you . ¶ Now 's the time for a little Vacation to clear the mind ¶ All right ! Guess you don 't shop off the rack , do you , huh , buddy ? ¶ Simple but oh , so nice ¶ ¶ It 's almost like paradise ¶ Shut up , Ralph ! Stupid dog . Yeah , what ? ¶ Hey now , hey now ¶ ¶ Now 's the time for a little Vacation to clear the mind ¶ ¶ Hey now , hey now ¶ Ralph ! Ralph ! Hey , Ralph ! Ralph ! Ralphie ! Ah ! ¶ Hey now , hey now ¶ ¶ Now 's the time for a little Vacation to clear the mind ¶ ¶ Hey now , hey now ¶ ¶ Like heaven on earth ¶ ¶ Simple but oh , so nice ¶ ¶ So nice ¶ ¶ Almost like paradise ¶ ¶ So nice ¶ ¶ Almost like paradise ¶ Do you mind ? It 's your pain in the butt neighbor again . Hey , park across the street . ¶ All right ¶ ¶ Check out the smiles ¶ Wake up , jerk ! Weak strategy , Wilcox . Should 've opened the door wider . Always deal from strength ! They would 've ripped the door off , Colonel ! Not likely ! They wouldn 't want to bruise their little hot rod . Even if they did , it 'd be worth it . Let the little bastards eat some steel for a change . It 's what you call an acceptable loss . Your car door is one . Your freedom is not ! Hi , honey . Jenny ? Been watching Baby Ruth again today , dear ? Doctor Ruth . I just thought , you sounded so sad on the phone that maybe you needed a little compassion . Don 't take this the wrong way , but I 'm just not in the mood . Oh . Don 't mention it . Thanks anyway . You 're welcome . I 'm just too upset . I mean , this was a horrible day . All I want to do right now is get out to the workshop , pick up my hammer , and hit things . Jenny ! What have you done ? ! Well , I ... What have you done ? ! Now , Charlie , don 't fly off the handle . Let me explain . I converted the shed into a rentable apartment . See how it solves our problems ? Now you don 't have to ask for that raise . You can let things happen naturally , like you like . Now , honey , don 't take it so hard . Your tools are still here . See ? Charlie ! Oh , Charlie . Now what ? Okay , okay ! All right , all right , all right ! What ? ! I 'm here to rent the apartment . Honey , it 's for you . Hi . I can 't believe you rented it out to that guy . He 's enormous . And he 's probably dangerous . Oh , Charlie . I am serious . You know , when it comes right down to it , I probably can 't protect you against a guy like that . Ooo . What 's so funny ? Oh , well . These yours ? Take your hands off my children ! That was cool . Yeah , can we do it again ? Okay , fine . Everybody , dinner . Hm . So , Mr. Ramsey , you 're not from around here , are you ? No . Oh . Where are you from ? France . How romantic . Ooo-la-la . Heh . Is it okay to have more ? Oh , sure . Help yourself . Oh . Sorry about that . Commander , we 've got a traceable power source . Can you pinpoint it ? I 'm working on it now , sir . Ah , gentlemen , you 're just in time . Here 's our man . We 're trying to get a lock on him now . We 've lost it , sir . Well , at least we know which side of the universe to start on . Correct ? I 'm sure you gentlemen know what to do when you leave here . Okay , okay . I 've got to deal with this . Got to get a grip . What the hell am I talking about , got to get a grip ? Darth Vader living in my back house , for chrissake . Ah , it 's all right . No big deal . I can handle it . Right after breakfast I 'll go out there and tell him , " Darth , " I 'll say , " There 's been a mistake . You have to leave . " " Now . " Morning . Good morning . Listen , Mr. Ramsey ... Shep . Okay , fine . Shep . Listen , Shep , the thing is , I 'm gonna have to ask ... Come on , Dad ! Theresa 's already in the car . Christ . Uh ... I 'll catch you later ... Shep . Come on , Dad . I 'm coming . Bye , honey . Whoa , Mister Ramsey ! No . It 's Marsha . Marsha ? Yes . Marsha Warfield . A TV show . I watch her everyday . It just so happens that today is about screaming for health . You know , to get out all those internal tensions before it becomes mental stress . Yeah . You wanna watch ? Stay down ! Oh ! Mr. Ramsey ! No ! No ! No ! It 's the mailman . Geez , lady , don 't you think you ought to cut his caffeine intake down a little bit ? Sorry . Bull 's-eye , mister . Oh , no ! Wait , Mister Ramsey ! It 's the paperboy . Okay . I 'm just gonna go inside now and I 'll see you later . Bull 's-eye , smart-ass . Hey , let 's go see your big guy . Yeah , good idea . Let 's go . Yeah . Whoa . Hey , Mr. Ramsey . Why don 't you try ? Yeah . Oh , geez . Even my mom can stay on longer than that . Great strength . Piss-ass balance . And who are you ? Commander of the ninety-fourth Fighting Beagles . Colonel Dustin " Dusty " McHowell , United States Army . You can call me Colonel . Who are you ? Ramsey . Shep Ramsey . Niplan First Class . Palander of the Secret Strike Force 119 under the guidance of Zanuck Vivian , Supreme Doctorate of Rule through Vita Nine . Vita Nine . Hm . Things certainly have changed since ' 44 . So he 's trapped , see . Knows he can 't win . What does he do ? Right then and there old Mad Dog surrenders . Surrenders the whole platoon . Wouldn 't you know , Shep . In one week , they was no good as a fighting force . That 's strategy . Sometimes you got to lose to win . Damn it ! What the hell ! Time for the Charlie Wilcox show . That 's not right . Hey ! Goldilocks ! You got any idea what these cars are worth ? Thirty thousand bucks ! You got any idea what we 're gonna do to you if we find one itty-bitty scratch on them ? Any idea ? ! Let me guess . You 're gonna pound my face , break every bone in my body , then you 're gonna drag me across a gravel road and feed my remains to a warthog . Is that about right ? What are you , nuts ? This is the nineties . We 're gonna sue you . We 're gonna get you for willful destruction of property . Yeah . Mental anguish . That 's giving it to him ! Loss of work hours . We get through with you , you ain 't gonna have a dime left to your name . You 'll be hearing from our attorney . What kind of world is this ? Hey , cool . Hey , check it out . Wanda lives there . Mark , get out of the road ! Mark , you all right ? Wow ! Rad ! What is that ? Hey ! Hey ! Shep ! You 're crazy ! Stop ! Shep ! Don 't , don 't ! Shep , no , don 't ! Don 't , don 't ! No , no . It 's okay . Okay . Shep . Don 't . Let 's go back to the house . Come on . Shep , this is for you in appreciation of everything you 've done for us and especially for saving our son , Mark . Do you all eat this stuff ? Yeah . Yeah ! It 's great . It 's chocolate cake . Oh . Charlie , get a picture of this . Hurry , quick . Set the timer . Hm , mm . Hurry . Okay . Quick . Okay . Cheese . Hey ! Hey ! Come back here , you little weasel ! Hey , stop him ! Somebody , help ! Help ! Is anybody there ? That guy 's got my purse ! Ma 'am . Oh . Thank you . - Stand back . - You are too close . Stand back . You are too close . This is your last warning . Back off now . No . Wait . Please . My mistake . You can stand as close as you want . In fact , take the car . No , please , wait . No . Let 's talk about this . No , ple ... Oh , lord . I 've fallen and I can 't get up . Must be a K-seven force field . Don 't worry . I 'll break you out of there . Glad I could help . Maybe I should stick to juggling . Power crystals seventy percent below operational . Approximately 21 Earth days to full recharge . You are stuck here . Whoa . Oh-ho-ho . No way you 're running the galaxy this time , Dragos ! Oh , no ! He damaged my left deflector ! Use your phasers ! I can 't ! I 'm in hyper space ! Then launch photon torpedoes . You 're crazy ! Dragos absorbs photons to get more power . Impossible ! I thought only Zennites could do that . My shields are failing ! Try boosting your ejectors . They 're out ! I 'm doomed ! It 's over . It 's never over . Forget it . No one can defeat Dragos . That 's what they said about General Suitor . Give it up , Dragos ! Give it up ! Give it up ! Give it up , Dragos ! Give it up ! Give it up , Dragos ! Wow ! You did it . You just saved the galaxy . Wow . You must play this game a lot . Game ? What game ? Hey , let me give you a hand . Uh ... no ! It 's ... really ... uh ... no . I insist . Glad I could help again . That 's it . I 'm staying in nights . Uh , uh ... Muscle amplifier . X-ray glasses . Wow . Please help me ! Told you she 's with me , man . Ow ! Help me ! Yeah , baby . Come here , baby ! Ouch ! No ! Don 't ! Help ! Let the woman go ! What in the hell are you supposed to be ? I said , let the woman go ! I have the strength of ten men ! I can hurt you . And I bet you can stop bullets too , huh ? Uh , no , no , no . Wait , wait , please , please . Let 's ... Let 's ... Let 's talk . Now I suggest that you let the woman ... - It 's a giant turtle . - That 's what the hell it is . Oh , God ! Don 't ! Help ! Come on , honey . Help ! Oh , God ! Thank you . You saved my life . If there 's anything I can do for you . Anything at all . Doing good is its own reward . Quiet ! Hey ! What ? ! My cat . My cat . That 's not my cat ! Oh . I hate suburbia . Well , you know , you have to be choosy this time of year , that 's if you want a ripe melon . Ripe ones are the best ones ? Well , of course they are . There is nothing more tasty than a ripe melon . Uh . How do you know which ones are the ripe ones ? Well , uh , you have to squeeze it a bit . And the softer the better , I always say . Heh . Wow ! I found a good one . Uh ! Eh ! Hey , buddy let me give you a hand . Hey , it 's just a gag . You can have the rope . Leave me alone ! Get out of here ! You 're crazy ! Magnify out . Again . Bounty hunters . Where 's Charlie Wilcox ? In a meeting . Can 't be disturbed . Leave a message or take a seat . I said take a seat ! My , what ... What a big one . Oh , funny ! That 's real funny ! Put that down ! Shame on you ! I 'm so happy . Please tell them how happy I am . You can do that , can 't you ? It 's here ! Wonderful . Eh , do you like it ? It 's for a new mini-mall . If you don 't like it , we 'll lose it . All right , off you go now . Time to get ready for the big party . Bye-bye now . Bye-bye , see you later . Banzai ! Save it for your lunch hour , huh , Marg ? All right , Charlie , here 's what I need from you now . I know you 're gonna come through for me . A set of finished blueprints . The lobby , the penthouse , whatever you think is gonna impress our Japanese friends the most . And I need them tonight . Tonight ? Now , now , there 's an echo . Yes , tonight . Come on , it 's tough , but so are you . Throwing a big bash for the new clients . Your blueprints are gonna seal the deal . But I ... But , but , but , but , but , but . Now are you a motor boat ? You can do it , Charlie . I know you can . You 're the one , you 're the man , you 're the king . Astonish me . Oh , and by the way , don 't forget to include all the little details that make up the Beltz trademark . One more thing . Why are you still here ? You should be going , you should be working . Time is money , go , go , go . Where 's my N-210 Algorizer ? Your what ? Did you follow me to my ship ? Yes . Did you sneak inside ? Well ... Did you fool with my stuff ? Where 's my N-210 Algorizer ? ! All right , drop him , Kong . It 's okay Margie , this is a friend of mine . Well , then take it outside . You know , maintenance has enough work to do without your blood on the carpet . Okay , let 's go . Where we going ? To where you saved this girl . I can 't go now . I 'm working , I 've got a deadline to meet . Wh-wh-what 's your hurry ? Get out of the way . Come on , let 's go . Ruthless interplanetary killers with the deadliest high-tech weaponry in existence may be on their way here right now because of you . Me ? ! What did I do ? The weapons , the suit . The power sources can be traced . When you turned them on it was like sending up a flare . Shep , I 'm sorry , I didn 't know . You didn 't ask . You said " may be " , that they " may " find their way here . They may not get an exact fix , they could pass us right by , if no more flares are sent up . That 's why you got to get that N-two-two ... thingee back , right ? Right . This is where I was shot . It 's where I fell over . Here 's where I crash-landed . And you saved this girl ? Yes , I saved the girl . Wait a minute . We can find them with this . It zeros in on the gun 's electronic signal . A homing device , great ! Why didn 't we just use this in the first place ? Shut up . Let 's go . Take a right . Right , Charlie . Okay , now step on it . Shep , this is illegal . Watch it ! - Take another right . Right here . - Turn . Good . - Left , left . Okay . - Take a right here , Charlie . What are you slowing down for ? Whoa ! - We made it . - Come on , Charlie . Take a left right here in the driveway . Is he dead ? Temporarily immobilized . He 'll thaw out in about 20 minutes , with a bad headache . Let 's go . Wow . A freeze gun . Hey , just a minute ! No skimming ' from the top ! Idle out , will you ? I 'm the one that found that thing , remember ? Yeah . Well , I 'm the one that figured out how the thing works . And I 'm the one that wants the thing back now . Shep , watch out ! Got ya ! Antifreeze . Charlie . Oh . You were right about that headache . It 'll pass . At least you got your N-2-thingee back . Now we can rest easy . Ha ! Yeah , sure . Except for one thing . They 're here . Who 's here ? A couple of leeches that make their living off the blood of others . Investment bankers ? Bounty hunters . Bounty hunters ? ! You mean from up there ? Wait a minute . Bounty hunters ? You said you were one of the good guys . I am . There was this evil tyrant named Suitor , planned to rule the universe . Had a lot of devoted followers , swore they 'd follow him even after death . I gave them the chance . So ... you 're some kind of space warrior . Right ? From where ? I mean , do you belong to some kind of army ? Or do you just go around doing good , like some kind of superhero ? Hey , this isn 't a cultural pow-wow here . The killers are loose on your streets out there . Ten minutes listening to your ice cream trucks , and they 'll level this town . Can they do that ? Yeah . - Hey , dudes ! - Welcome to Surfin ' Burger . How about the big , big , gnarly burger ? We got the wipeout burger , got the dude burger . We got the hang ten burger , And the totally awesome burger . Hey . Hang on , you guys ! You just got married ! Whoa ! This is cool ! You two are so cute together , you know , we got the special honeymoon burger for just newlyweds like yourself ... How are you gonna get this thing outta here ? Vertical blast . Are you sure it 'll work ? Shut up . Well , then , Shep . I guess this is goodbye . I don 't do goodbyes , Charlie . Oh , no ! Down ! That 's it , then . That 's what ? We have to fight . We ? We . I 'm setting you up as a decoy . This suit can take two direct hits . Two ? You 'll draw their fire while I counterattack . Try this . I don 't think so . Look , I 'm just your landlord . I bring you an extra bar of soap when you need it . Perhaps help stop the occasional bank robbery . But being the target for intergalactic bounty hunters is a little out of my line . Listen , little man . It 's your fault they 're here . My fault ? Yeah . You came to my house trying to pass yourself off as an earthling . How the hell was I supposed to know that you 're some sort of alien Rambo with psycho enemies ? What kind of a man are you , anyway ? Your planet , your family ... Exactly . My planet , my family were fine before you brought the intergalactic grudge match here . You 've put them in danger . All these guys want is you . Christ . I was frozen today . Okay . You win . It 's not your fight . Listen , I 'd help you any way I could , but you can 't expect ... No , it 's all right . Forget it . It was a million in one shot , anyway . I 'll fight them myself . If I lose , at least they 'll leave your planet . They 'll have to take my body back for the reward , anyway . Doesn 't it have to be that way ? Unless you can tell me where I can find about 40 pounds of Cymian crystal . Cy ... Beltz . Thank you . Thanks . Hors d 'oeuvres ? Well , hey , if it isn 't Fred and Barney . How did you two boys patch up your little differences ? Yes , we did . Thanks , Margie . You know , I don 't believe I caught your friend 's name the other day . Shep . He 's from out of town . Don 't they have parties where you come from ? Not like this one . I know . Dull , huh ? - Football . - That 's my idea of a night out . Football ? Oh , yeah . I mean , what could be better than a bunch of beefy , burly boys , beating the crap out of each other trying to score . Being a burly boy . Where did you say you were from ? Uh , listen , Margie , I promised Shep I 'd show him my office . Your office ? What 'd you do that for ? The crystals . The universe . Remember ? You know , Charlie , I spend more time saving worlds than I do living in them . Sometimes I wonder why . You 've got everything , Charlie . So I said to the President , " Hey , look , I just build the S and L 's . I don 't run ' em . " Don 't , don 't . There you go . How 's the champagne ? A little more champagne ? How about a round of Kamikazes ? Just special for tonight . Tell them , tell them that . Damn . There should be a key around here somewhere . Of course . Here we go . Fifty pounds of Cymian crystal . Thanks , Charlie . You 've been a great help . Now , if you 'll excuse me ... No , wait ! They must be in the building somewhere . Where ? You know , this device can be traced . Calculated risk . Yeah . Got ' em . They 're upstairs in the new wing . Let 's go . By the way , uh , do you like it in here ? It 's finished . I 'm kidding , I 'm kidding . But this is the way his building is gonna look . These are all jokes . Anyway , take a look , seriously , over here , fellas . See that space ? That 's how confident I am about this project , I 'm unveiling it at the signing , huh ? Get him outta here . Uh , Mister Zukaki is very impressed by your ... style . Right back at him . You too . Wilcox ! Wonderful ! Just the man I wanted to see . He is the best , and with a little help and guidance , one of the very best . Did you make the alterations I specified ? Uh , yes , yes , yes . I left them down in the car . Car , car . Wh ... Why the car ? I 'll go and pick them up and bring them to your office . Good , splendid . One more thing . Will I be astonished ? I think so . I almost kissed you . But I wouldn 't . Good . Go . Ready , everyone ? Off to the party . Here we go , and one-two , one-two . That 's good , size order , it 's important . Hold it right there . Boys , boys , boys . Now , why don 't you put that back where it belongs ? Bounty hunters . Let 's get out of here . Tag . You 're it . You know , for a big guy , you 're kinda light on your feet ! Have a nice flight , camel-breath ! Talk about cheap construction . What ... ? Oh . Oh ! Get your foot out of my face ! Oh , what is this , a tag team ? You 're a dead man , Ramsey . No wonder you guys never talk . Game over . You lose . Have you been to the tar pits ? Really a must-see . They 're right out there in ... Mr. Zukaki requests that you explain the plans to him now . Wonderful . Who , me ? All right , sir . Uh , it gets a little technical , I hope you follow here . We feel , and I 'll go the distance with you on this one , we feel very strongly that the building should have floors , and that 's of course , one per level . Now , it goes without saying that one man 's floor 's another man 's ceiling . That 's why in order to keep them separate we 're recommending walls . Why don 't you just let me take you to a doctor ? You don 't have to leave right away . I mean , you just waxed the enemy . Why don 't you ... No . That 's all right . Shep , you said yourself you spend all your time saving worlds without ever living in them . This is your chance to live in one . You said I put your family and planet in danger with this interplanetary grudge match . You were right . I 'm leaving before others come . Yes , but ... Shep ! Charlie , do me a favor . Go back to my place and make sure I 've got everything . I don 't want to risk leaving even one of those traceable devices behind . Okay . And Charlie , thanks . Jenny ? Jenny ? Jenny ? Oh , Charlie ! Daddy ! Daddy ! What 's the matt ... Who are you ? What do you want ? General Suitor , at your service . Suitor ? But you 're supposed to be dead . So sorry to disappoint . And you , I take it , are the partner . Partner ? Charlie , what 's he talking about ? I was trying to help Shep escape some intergalactic bounty hunters . You see , Shep 's an alien warrior , who foiled this man 's attempt at ruling the universe . Charlie , this is serious . Yes , Charlie . This is serious . Perfect timing . I 'm sorry , Shep , I had no choice . I said I don 't do goodbyes . Ahh , but I insisted ! Suitor ! Did you think I was so stupid not to have planned for every contingency ? There were many gunnery bubbles on that ship , you know . No ! No , no ! Get over there . Get over there ! Move ! Move ! This endless cat and mouse grows tiresome , Ramsey . I suggest you come out here now , unless you want this happy little group melted to the ground ! If it 'd end your career it 'd be worth it . Bad bluff , Ramsey . You see , I know something . You actually care for these creatures . You 're wrong . They mean nothing to me . Please , let her go ! You 've got ten seconds to come out with your hands up , Ramsey . Before you see the inside of this beautiful child 's head . Ten seconds , Ramsey ! Sometimes you gotta lose to win . Warning . The self-destruct mechanism has been activated . That wasn 't the deal . Here 's the deal : First you let them go , then you can do whatever you want with me . I won 't even put up a fight . - You think I am a fool ? - Why should I believe you ? Because I , unlike you , am as good as my word . How quaint . Well , let them go . I didn 't come here to swat at flies . Get them out of here , Charlie . Now ! Hurry ! Yes ! This is pleasant ! I 've dreamed about this moment ever since you blew up my ship . I didn 't like that . How fitting , then , that your death will be the catalyst that starts my rebuilding to ultimate power ! So this is how you 're gonna do me in , by boring me to death with speeches . Oh , unfortunately for you , you 're going to die much more painfully . I 'm going back to help him . Oh , Charlie , I can 't let you do that . Shep could 've taken that guy out , but he didn 't . He didn 't for us . We can 't just leave him there to die . You might get yourself killed . Listen , this is something I have got to do . Oh , Charlie . Be careful . We need you . Ooh , this is much more fun than I had imagined . So few things in life live up to expectation , don 't you find ? I wonder how killing you is going to feel . Shep ! Shep ! Shep ! Shep ! Forget it . He is finished . But you , you 're just starting . You son of a bitch ! You stupid little man . What do you hope to do to me , to me , the almighty . Suitor ! Why , I could crush your neck ! Charlie , no ! With my bare ha ... Charlie , get outta here , now ! Ow ! Oh , my God ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Look ! Look ! Oh ! Charlie ! Charlie ! Charlie ! What happened ? Is the world saved ? Oh , Charlie , you are all right . He took on Suitor all by himself . With his bare hands . He 's some kinda guy . Oh , Charlie , you are the finest man I have ever known . But if you ever do anything like this again , I 'll kill you ! Way to go , Dad ! You 're the greatest . Give up ? It was Raymond Burr in " Godzilla " . Nick Adams was in " Rodan " . Now " Mothra " , that 's another classic , by the way ... Wilcox ! All right , this better be good . Make it good , make it fast . We 've been up all night . Zukaki 's about to take his business elsewhere , I 'm running out of movies . Just explain your incompetence ! My incompetence ? Yes ! Is that what you 've been telling them ? I 've been telling them what 's good for the company . Just be a man and accept the responsibility . I 'm the one who 's been saving your butt for the last three years . You want somebody to talk to Mr. Zukaki about incompetence ? Do it yourself ! You 're the expert . I quit ! Wilcox ! Charlie ! Chuck ? Coffee ? Hey , dude , how about a bomb pop ? Whoa ! Hey , you 're leaving ? Leaving . Bad guys beat ? The galaxy 's saved . No loose ends , then ? Hey , look ! It 's the giant ! Well , maybe one loose end . Hey , man , I just got that ! Use his . Whoa ! Radical ! Pure luck . Was not , was not ! So what ? My mom did that last week . Whoa ! He 's going for a full locked hand-stand ! No way ! Way . Tell your mom to keep practicing . Oh , man . My last board . Take mine . Cowabunga , dude ! Are you sure ? You want me to change my mind ? Heck , no ! Well , get outta here ! - Can I ride it ? - No , he gave it to me . I helped him save the galaxy ! Again ? My cat . Are you sure ? Positive ? Bad kitty ! Uh-oh ! Whoa ! Thanks . Get a goldfish . So what are you gonna do now , Charlie ? Something will turn up . Life 's too short not to take a chance . Maybe I 'll become an intergalactic warrior . Yeah , and maybe I 'll become a family man . All right , E.T. , ready for blast-off . Purely educational . Well , I 'd better get going . You never know who 's gonna be out there trying to retrieve this hunk of hardware . Right . So ... Well ... Have a nice flight . Hey , Charlie . Too good to say goodbye ? Bye , Shep . Goodbye , Charlie . Shep . See you around . See you around , Charlie . Goodbye , Mr. Ramsey ! Bye , Shep !

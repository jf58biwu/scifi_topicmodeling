 Last week on Wild Palms : Is he still seeing the shrink ? Yeah . He 's having nightmares . An old lover of mine came into my office this morning . - Paige . - I want you to help me find my son . He disappeared five years ago . I had the dream again last night . If you 're afraid of the rhino , the dream goes away . Senator Tony Kreutzer . I have seen the future . And it is Channel 3 . Who did that to you ? Church of the Fathers . Would they have taken my baby and given me the son of another ? Answer me , Father . We 're talking two groups , political enemies . The Fathers and the Friends . I will come for you all . And you will help me , Harry Wyckoff . That 's why you were born . No . Tommy ! This is how it begins . Paige , wait . I wanna know why you don 't return my calls . Harry , I 've been out of town . An emergency . - What is it ? What 's going on ? - I need to talk to you about Tommy . Drop it , Harry . It 's done . Wait , I can 't drop it . He 's my closest friend ! Your closest friend took my little boy away from me ! I know . You keep saying that , but I don 't believe it . He was in love with me . Tommy ? That night that you introduced us , he hit on me heavily . That 's not Tommy . I thought he was just loaded trying to be funny . Harry 's wild-man best friend . But he was pretty out of control . A year later , you and I were fighting . You said some terrible things . Tommy came over . We got drunk . I can wing the rest . - The omnivorous Paige Katz . - It never happened again . When you and I split up Tommy thought I 'd want to be with him . He became obsessed . He even started working for the senator to be near me . - Tommy worked for the senator ? - He rose to First Tier Synthiotics . Then they caught him trying to steal Mimecom software . It broke the senator 's heart . That 's when Tommy joined the Friends . Why would he take your son ? Revenge . Because he couldn 't have me . The Friends said it was political . A retaliation against the senator and his people . Peter 's kidnapping was an act of personal terrorism . And nothing more . " The senator and his people " ? The Fathers . The senator founded the Fathers . I thought you knew . I got a pile of work that needs to be handled before the Windows debut . - Why did you want me down here ? - Just for a little demo . - I 've seen the damn demo . - Not this , you haven 't . - We 're gonna add a little twist . - Like what ? Like , drink this . - Like , what is this ? - Mimezine . A.k.a. " pharm juice . " It 's experimental . - From your yoga friends , right ? - True media freaks , what can I say ? I don 't know . What exactly is this stuff ? It 's an empathogen . Brewed up by rogue neuropharmacologists . Only lasts two minutes . - What are the side effects ? - Just one . It 'll change your life . No delayed dental-chair orgasms ? Not as long as you floss . I don 't know , Gav . I don 't think we should do this at work . Maybe the weekend . Why are you being such a prude ? Where 's your sense of adventure ? Well ... - Nobody knows ? - Nobody knows . Drink . Now what ? Are you experienced , Harry ? Can you be serious for a minute ? Hope you like Wagner . May I talk to you a moment ? Hello . I just wanted to thank you personally for your vote , judge . - Gavin , what is this ? - It 's the Mimezine . Its flooding your cerebral cortex . I saw the way you looked at me on-stage . I wanted you to touch me . Go on , Harry . The adaptor 's tracking your hands . The Mimezine will give the illusion of touch . You made me queen of the pageant . Now I 'll make you king ... - ... with my mouth . - Go for it , Harry . Yes . Yes . We have contact ! It was the weirdest thing I 've ever experienced . Was it legal , what he gave you ? Mimezine ? It 's not even classified yet . It works on the lower brain . They 're tapping into some kind of primordial , cortical weirdness . I don 't know . What they 've been talking about is true , Grace . There is a new reality . Hail , Synthiotics . Hey . What 's the matter ? Just a little tired , I guess . - You been drinking , Grace ? - A little vermouth . Helps me with my diary of a mad housewife . I 'm feeling very ' 20s lately . Very Zelda Fitzgerald . I 'm a flapper without fins . All right . Let 's dry you off . No . Just a little while longer . Tell me more about your little tryst . A love-struck beauty-pageant queen . Brings a whole new spin to infidelity . Let 's be scientific , may we ? If you were to compare the way she kissed ... Wait a minute . It wasn 't really a kiss . It was a head thing . But for argument 's sake how would she rate next to Paige Katz ? There isn 't anything between Paige and me . Nothing but blood and tissue and hot , hot tears . Excuse me while I slip into a warm coma . Grace ? Grace . My God , Grace . You know what Japan is , Harry ? It 's a pretty little girl who throws up to stay thin . Post-suicidal musings by Grace Wyckoff . When I was little Mama used to take me to Hiroshima for the kabuki . There was one about this deformed princess born with her hand in a fist . Someone turned her into a whore . Why did you do it , Grace ? Why ? Because we like you . I feel like an animal that knows it 's gonna die . Full of ghosts , kabuki . I always loved the ghosts . Never scared me . They scare me now , Harry . They scare me now . Gavin ? What 's happening ? We 're sorry to hear about Grace . Come here , I wanna show you something . Say hello , Stitch Walken . Come . How are you doing , Harry ? I just flew in from the perceptory . And , boy , is my mind tired . You 've probably seen him on cable . He 's hilarious . Mind telling me what 's going on ? Who are you , Marvin Gaye ? ~ What 's going on ? ~ Stitch does this bit about laundry . Do that bit for him . Go on . My relationship was in the toilet , Harry . The old lady and I were fighting all the time . So Mom finally threw me out . For the first time in my life , I had to do my own laundry . Took me three months . Everything said " wash separately . " Do you love it ? What is this , Gavin ? Am I dreaming ? No , it 's okay , you 're fine . Down , down , down . Through the pool of tears . Welcome , Harry . What the hell is all this ? These are the tunnels the Friends built . And these are the hands that dug the tunnels . And these are the eyes that watched the hands that dug . What happened to you ? Had a makeover . Josie and I put our heads together , came up with a whole new look . It does have its advantages , Tully . You don 't have to be designated driver anymore . Someone tell me what the hell is going on . Still having the visions , Harry . The rhino 's key , Harry . We all saw the rhino . Not everyone sees the rhino . I 'd kill for some onion soup . Lose your self-importance . No one cares about Harry Wyckoff . You think the senator cares ? Look , I 'm not interested in anything political . Okay ? Just let me go . Gavin , I have a family . - A semblance of a family . - The depression the country ... went through was planned , Harry . - And the Florida bomb ? - Ninety thousand dead . Know what one of our Southern senators called it ? A cotton burn-off , Harry . A controlled fire . No terrorists involved . Strictly government . Boca Raton was a premeditated nuclear event that conferred extraordinary new powers on the police . The Liberty Bell , textbook stuff . Within two years , the Friends were decimated murdered or locked up in desert hospitals . Wake up , Harry . You 're having a very important nightmare . - Why are you telling me all this ? - Wanna wind up like Tommy ? What 's the matter with him ? Where 's he ? - They 're dosing him with Mimezine . - No . We 're the shock troops of reality , Harry , don 't you understand ? Go see Grace 's father . Eli Levitt . Smart man . - Her father ? - Your marriage was arranged , Harry . Coty isn 't your son . He was conceived in a Synthiotics house in upstate New York and delivered in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel . Bought and sold , property of the Fathers . That much we know . Help us , Harry . Think about where you came from . I know you 've been trying to remember . Think . Think . Think . Think . Think . They said I was living in an old safe house from the early days in the Movement . There 's this huge network of tunnels . Like a subway for paranoids . And where did you surface ? I was blindfolded . Somewhere near the beach . I haven 't had a chance to drain the pool to see if it was just a dream . You 've been under stress . Grace 's hospitalization hasn 't helped . They said crazy things about my marriage . About my son . Sick as this sounds , I wish I 'd seen the rhino . That way , I would have known it was a dream . Help ! Help me ! Help ! Help ! Help me ! They 're chasing me . Help , they 're chasing me . Get in ! Thanks , mister . Say , wait a minute . - You 're Coty Wyckoff . - How do you know my name ? I met you at the house . I work with your dad at Channel 3 . - They wanna kill me . - Who wants to kill you ? What were you doing out there with those maps ? Peter called . He said he was in trouble . - Peter ? - You know who Peter is . That 's why you stopped . You thought I was him . - The tattoos ... - It 's only paint . - Why ? - Peter said I had to make it look like it was him . Where is he ? Peter . I 'm really sorry about that . It 's not supposed to hurt , by the way . It wears off . I just wanted to talk to you . You know , I made up all the stuff about Peter being here . This is a hard time for us . Exciting , but hard . I 'm sure you know about Mom being in the hospital . There 's lots of pressure on Dad too . Windows , the new job . Everyone thinks he 's doing a great , though . It 's just extra hard when the Friends tell him a bunch of stuff that isn 't true . You know what 's funny to think about ? You love food so much . But you 're never gonna eat again . Not an egg or a strawberry even a little baby pea . They 're going to come in soon and talk to you about Peter . It won 't be so bad . They showed me how but I 'm a little nervous . I 'm going to do some cutting now , okay ? - Hi there . - Hi . Are you visiting someone ? My mother . - What 's your name ? - Peter . I 'm Grace . Did they put you in a bathtub with a cover and a little hole to stick your head through ? Not that I know of . That 's what they did to Olivia de Havilland in The Snake Pit . I have her house on my map . The place that she used to live . May I see the terrace ? The eagle has landed . - My mother ? - You 're going home in style . She brought a limo . I 'll be right there . Peter ? I told you , Tommy 's at Central Jail . That 's not what I 've heard , Paige . Anyway , I called there . They have no record of a Tommy Lazlo . - We 'll talk about it later . - Paige . It 's beautiful . It 's for meditation ? Tell me what you see . You know , like a Rorschach . What is this , Zen Freudism ? People usually say : " Islands in the sea mountains in the clouds ... " Dogs in the water , maybe ? - Dogs in the water ? - Yeah . See ? Paddling . The rocks look like little heads in the water . - I haven 't heard that before . - Did I fail the serenity test ? - Harry , Harry . - Hey , boss . How does my garden grow ? Oh , it 's beautiful . Incredible . I really love it . You recognize it ? It 's a ... Zen garden . - The Zen garden . - The Zen garden . Ryoanji in Kyoto . Faithful to the centimeter . Harry says it looks like dogs in the water . - I was kidding . - I love that . Then I wasn 't kidding . He looked at Ryoanji and saw dogs in the water . That 's kick-ass haiku . Anton was going to have the real thing brought over , stone by stone . - Seriously ? - Damn right . Yakuza , who 'd steal the whole damn garden for me . They never did recover the pieta . I fell in love . The first time I saw it . That was 30 years ago . You 're going to Kyoto . Both of you . Soon as Windows debuts . - Why ? - I want you to pick something up . Part of the Go game . You 've played Go , haven 't you , Harry ? As in , " everything must " ? Paige is a hell of a guide . She 'll show you the Tao . And I 'm not talking Dow Jones . I can 't believe they killed Gavin . You 're not gonna get depressed , are you ? - Hey , don 't be a wise guy . - I wasn 't being a wise guy . You 're being a wise guy . Watch you mouth . I 'm not depressed , darling . It 's awful . I hope they catch whoever 's responsible . One of Gavin 's kids is a cop . Maybe it 's a retaliation . Is this suitable table talk ? What time is it ? What time is it , Grammy ? You know , little guy , you 're worse than Christmas morning . Can we excuse ... - ... this perceptual-motion machine ? - Go ahead , take your sister . I 'm glad he 's excited . I 'm about to heave . Honey , why don 't we get away for a couple of days . Just take a drive , maybe up to Big Sur . Yeah , sure , when I get back . The senator wants me to go to Kyoto . When ? Wednesday morning . - I 'll go . - Don 't be desperate , darling . You 're just back on your feet . The last thing you want is travel . It 's just a business trip . Literally , I 'm gonna be there for 48 hours . Harry , come on . I 'll be incognito . I 'll wear these big old Jackie O. sunglasses and stow away in first class . The senator won 't even notice me . Grace . I 'm flying over with Paige Katz . She speaks fluent Japanese . She has personal relationships ... - ... with the people I 'm going to meet . - It 's okay . - Are you sure ? - It 's fine . Daddy , it 's on . It 's 8 : 00 . Come on . - Okay . - Did you check the box ? Yeah , yeah . The box should be working . " Should " ? That 's all we need . - Harry , you 're gonna break it . - There . - See ? Bunch of worriers . I know ... - There it is ! - Harry , is it up ? - It 's up . It 's up . - Is the adaptor on ? - It 's on . It 's on . - It 's on . - Quiet , quiet . Cool . Not bad . - Could use a little fixing up . - But , Ma , it 's a church . We handle all kinds of unusual properties . Moved a young couple into an old mortuary last week . Very chic . To die for . Don 't you love it ? When did you say you lost your husband ? Nice segue . A year ago . The strange thing is , he was a minister . Why , then this is perfect . The price is right . It 's close to the schools and to God . He 's a local call . Not everyone can say they have the Almighty as a landlord . Emphasis on " lord . " Now we have begun . - What was that ? - It 's a holographic tape of Chap . Ushio is mad about the ' 60s . I should have worn my Beatle boots . So you met before ? - This mysterious Ushio ? - No . Thank you . An honor to finally meet you . Paige Katz . Terrific ! I knew it ! I smelled the lotion . So much Oiseaux . Lovely but overpowering . Next time I 'll dilute it . I smell it on Harry Wyckoff . Are you enjoying Kyoto , Mr. Wyckoff ? It 's lovely . I haven 't seen much of it . Will you have time to see the Golden Pavilion ? I 'd like that very much . I 'm afraid this is a very short trip . My wife was pretty upset that I didn 't bring her along . What 's he saying ? That the senator made a good choice , having you represent him . Yes . Terrific choice . How is Chickie Levitt ? - Chickie Levitt ? - Yes . How is he ? He 's well . Harry visited Chickie just before he left . He 's fragile . But seems happy . How extraordinary . Chickie 's been ill . What a delight , Ms. Katz . What do they take me for ? Umbrella maker ? Sorry , we 're through with you . - There 's nothing for you here . - You promised us . A message to the senator . Ms. Katz . He wants the Go chip . No Go . Goodbye , Mr. Chip . - Please , wait . - In my room . That 's where I belong . The Beach Boys sure had it right . What the hell is going on ? Someone 's playing a game . - Go back in the morning . - Why did they ask me about Chickie ? Chickie works for us . - He what ? - I only found out myself two days ago . You 're lying . I don 't like being ambushed , Paige . I don 't know what the hell I 'm doing here anyway . Grace barely out of the hospital . You 're here because you wanted to be with me . It just doesn 't feel right . I wanna go back to L.A. Please , wait . No . It 's okay . This geisha 's going for a walk . They might follow you . They 're dangerous . Who 's dangerous , Paige ? I wanna know . Tell me . Who 's dangerous ? Harry Wyckoff . Who 's there ? I 'm a friend of Grace 's . Please . Off the streets . I watched you at the club . Yeah ? I didn 't see you . How do you know my wife ? Grade school . First love . Why did you follow me ? Those people , they worked for Josie Ito 's husband . - The one she murdered . - Murdered ? His company was a rival of Mimecom . The senator wanted to merge , but Ito wouldn 't deal . And they found him with a sword through the roof of his mouth . And Chickie Levitt ? Mimecom 's bleeding his secrets . You were sent for the most coveted . A nanochip called " Go . " And the laughing old man ? Ushio Kawabata , Chickie 's mentor . - You met him once . - No , I would have remembered . Under a different name . Tara . - The ballerina . - In the Web people look any way they want . This is too marvelous ! - What 's happening ? - They 're Friends , Harry . We have something for you . Couldn 't give it before . Keep your asses away from me ! Get away from me . - Who the hell ... ? - Wyckoff ! Hold him . Hold him ! Here we go . Hide and reveal . - They don 't want Chickie hurt . - Look , I think I know where he is . - I 'll make sure Chickie 's safe . - Yes . - Make sure , Harry . - I only met him once , damn it ! - Let me go and I 'll help you . - " Let me go . " Everybody wants to go . Especially our Senator Kreutzer . He is the Go master . And Josie is the Go-Go girl ! - What are you gonna do ? - In my room . The whole world is like a tiny little room ... - ... don 't you think , Harry ? - No ! Everything must go ! From here to eternity . No ! - Hi there . - Eileen . Sorry about dropping in like this . I 've been drinking . That 's my boy . He 's a cop . He didn 't want me to come here . He 's embarrassed . Our little one 's just 5 , you know . He doesn 't know what 's happened to his dad - Eileen , I 'm so sorry . You know , the police showed me pictures of Gavin . I don 't know why they did that . The papers said that it was political . They said that it was the Friends . A lie ! It was the Fathers ! Damn them , Grace . Damn them to hell ! I 'm not supposed to say that , but what difference does it make now ? You 're not going to turn me in to Channel 3 are you , Grace ? Hey , I almost forgot . I brought you something . Here . Where did you find this ? Gavin had it in his pocket when they found him . I thought it belonged to one of the kids . Then I remembered ... .. the night we had dinner here . Coty showed us his collection of sweet rhinoceri . You know , Timmy , he 's our youngest . Timmy , he sings a song Gavin taught him . ~ What is that climbing up my stair ? ~ ~ It 's not a boar ~ ~ It 's not a bear ~ ~ And on its snout , it has a horn ~ ~ As odd as any unicorn ~ ~ But wait , there must be three or four ~ ~ Who 've wobbled Through my kitchen door ~ ~ And though it sounds preposterous ~ What happened to Gavin Whitehope ? Are you drunk ? - Did you hurt him ? - Get off of me ! Answer me . Was Grammy with you ? Did she make you do it ? Did she make you , baby ? - Did Grammy make you ? - I did it myself . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . What am I going to do ? - You 're still my baby . - Let me go ! You 're just a little boy . I 'm not gonna let them hurt you . I thought they were gonna kill me . A crazy voice kept going through my head , over and over : " I 'm going to die in a temple in Kyoto . " Have you seen a doctor ? No . I still don 't know how I got back from the temple . Paige found me the next morning , outside the house . It was drizzling . The perfect picture of a floating world . An hour later , we were on the plane on our way back to L.A. - Mother . - Darling . What a surprise . Gentlemen , this is my daughter , Grace . What have you done to him ? - What are you talking about ? - He 's killing for you now ! My daughter 's been ill . Please excuse us . You 've got a hell of a mouth on you . Watch someone doesn 't take a needle and sew it up . You leave that little boy alone . Don 't insult me by pretending you don 't know what 's happening . You knew from the beginning . Weak dog ! We have come too far to be terrorized by your prim sensitivities . Do I make myself clear ? Answer me . Yes . - What are you doing ? - It 's Peter . How did you get in the car ? Hiro 's coming . Hiro ? - When ? - Soon . Who are you ? What are those . They 're pictures . Pictures of the floating world . - Harry , it 's Grace . - Yes . Yes . She 's been upstairs for hours ... - ... watching holotapes of Coty . - Slow down . It 's ... - ... something creepy . - Okay . Calm down , all right ? Hold on to that . Hello . I like listening to the radio . Safer than the damn television . Yeah , I know what you mean . They don 't usually allow visitors in the infirmary . Guess you got juice . - You have a flu ? - A small case of mood poisoning . Must be something I hate . - I don 't know exactly why I came here . - Join the club . I know who you are . - Grace told you ? - No . I had my suspicions . The world would be a terrible place without them . Why did you keep it a secret all these years ? Shame . Embarrassment . Her mama did a pretty good number on her . The Friends have a nickname for Josie : Hannya . Female demon . Why that woman 's let me live all these years , I 'll never know . Sexual obsession , I imagine . - A friend of mine was arrested . - Tommy Lazlo ? Yes , that 's right . There was a famous chemist back in the ' 60s . He was playing around with the fugu . Puffer fish . Ever heard of it ? A delicacy in Japan . The dose in a single fish can kill . A lesser amount gets you high . Mimecom grabbed it , tweaked it and came up with something of their own . They call it Mimezine . It allows you to interact with holograms . Is it real or is it Mimecom ? Impossible to tell . - Go on . - Beware the mimetaur , Mr. Wyckoff . They want to fold the whole thing into television . Tommy knew that . Tommy knew a lot more . - I don 't understand . - Church Windows is nothing . A finger bowl for the entrée . ~ A Mimezine grace ~ ~ How sweet the sound ~ Quite a package for the masses . You see , the senator needs energy for his final flight . All that business with the Go chip . He needs support . Like a king being held aloft by the minds of his minions . He is our Alexander . He will conquer the countries of our imaginations one by one . And we will dream him into infinity . That famous chemist I was telling you about that one who pioneered it all ? His name was Dex Wyckoff . Your daddy . You knew my father ? No . But the senator did . They were partners . What are you watching there ? Lazlo ? Hey . Answer me when I ... Escaping ! Tara doesn 't know anything . She 's more than just an innocent ballerina . That old man in Kyoto shouldn 't have betrayed you , Chickie . You could 've been back at the beach by now . Ushio didn 't betray me . Ushio is the ballerina , can 't you see that ? Ushio is Tara . - Liar ! - Talk to me , Chickie . Tell me about the Go chip or Tara 's gonna hurt . It 's that simple . She 's already in pain . Don 't make it worse . Tell me your secrets . Help the senator . And Tara will be free . ~ And on its snout , it has a horn ~ ~ As odd as any unicorn ~ Do you wanna hear the song again ? ~ What is that climbing up my stair ? ~ ~ It 's not a boar , it 's not a bear ~ ~ And on its snout , it has a horn ~ ~ As odd as any unicorn ~ ~ What is that climbing up my stair ? ~ ~ It 's not a boar , it 's not a bear ~ ~ And on its snout , it has a horn ~ - Grace ! Grace ! - Grace . Grace ! - What is it ? No ! - What is it ? - No ! No ! - No ! - What is that , Grace ? ! Come on !

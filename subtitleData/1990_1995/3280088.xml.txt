 Everybody , heads up ! Keep it clear . Okay , down . Keep going . Come on ! That 's good . Stay . Slow it down . Okay , pushing team , move in there . Move it ! I want tasers on full charge . - Steady ! - Come on , step back in . All right , move it . And push ! We 're unlocked . Loading team , step away . Gate keeper . Jophery , raise the gate . Block the opening ! Don 't let her get out ! Work her back ! Shoot her ! Shoot her ! What 's this I hear at the airport ? Hammond 's not even here ? He sends his apologies . We are facing a $ 20 million lawsuit by the family of that worker ... and you 're telling me that Hammond can 't even be bothered to see me ? He had to leave early . He wants to be with his daughter . - She 's getting a divorce . - I understand that ... but we 've been advised to deal with the situation now . - The insurance company - - Okay ? Underwriters feel the accident 's raised serious safety questions about the park . That makes the investors very , very anxious . I had to promise to conduct a very thorough on-site inspection . Hammond hates inspections . They slow everything down . Juanito , they 'll pull the funding . That 'll slow him down even more . Watch your head . If two experts sign off on the island ... the insurance guys will back off . I 've already got Ian Malcolm , but they think he 's too trendy . - They want Alan Grant . - Grant ? - You 'll never get him out of Montana . - Why not ? Why not ? Because Grant 's like me . He 's a digger . Dr. Grant , Dr. Sattler , we 're ready to try again . I hate computers . The feeling 's mutual . - How long does this usually take ? - It should bring an immediate return . Shoot the radar into the ground and the bone bounces the image back . Bounces it back . This new program 's incredible . A few more years ' development and we won 't even have to dig anymore . Where 's the fun in that ? It 's a little distorted , but I don 't think it 's the computer . Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments . - Velociraptor ? - Yes . Good shape too . It 's five , six feet high . I 'm guessing nine feet long . - Look at the extraordinary - - What did you do ? He touched it . Dr. Grant 's not machine compatible . They 've got it in for me . And look at the half-moon-shaped bones in the wrists . It 's no wonder these guys learned how to fly . Seriously . Well , maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds ... than they do with reptiles . Look at the pubic bone - turned backward , just like a bird . Look at the vertebrae , full of air sacs and hollows ... just like a bird . And even the word " raptor " means " bird of prey . " That doesn 't look very scary . The kid 's a pistol . More like a six-foot turkey . A turkey , huh ? Oh , no . - Okay . - Here we go . Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period . You get your first look at this six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing . He moves like a bird ... lightly bobbing his head . And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity ... is based on movement , like T-rex , and he 'll lose you if you don 't move . But no , not velociraptor . You stare at him ... and he just stares right back . And that 's when the attack comes - not from the front , but from the side ... from the other two raptors ... you didn 't even know were there . Because velociraptor 's a pack hunter , you see . He uses coordinated attack patterns ... and he is out in force today . And he slashes at you with this - a six-inch retractable claw - like a razor - on the middle toe . He doesn 't bother to bite your jugular , like a lion , say . No , no . He slashes at you ... here or here . Oh , Alan . Or maybe across the belly ... spilling your intestines . The point is ... you are alive when they start to eat you . So , you know ... try to show a little respect . Okay . Hey , Alan , if you wanted to scare the kid ... you could have pulled a gun on him , you know . Yeah , I know . Kids . You want to have one of those ? I don 't want that kid ... but a breed of child , Dr. Grant , could be intriguing . - I mean , what 's so wrong with kids ? - Oh , Ellie , look . They 're noisy , they 're messy , they 're expensive . Cheap , cheap . - They smell . - They do not smell . - Some of them smell . Babies smell . - Give me a break . - Cover the site ! - Cover up the dig ! - Tell them to shut down ! - Cut the machine ! Cover it all up ! Okay , pull it over ! Just cut it , will you ? Cut it out ! Shut it down ! What ? What the hell do you think you 're doing in here ? Hey ! We were saving that ! For today . I guarantee it . - Who in God 's name do you think you are ? - John Hammond . And I 'm delighted to meet you finally in person , Dr. Grant . - Mr. Hammond - - I can see that my ... fifty thousand dollars a year has been well spent . Okay , who 's the jerk ? - This is our paleobotanist , Doctor - - Sattler . Ellie , this is Mr. Hammond . Sorry about the dramatic entrance , Dr. Sattler ... - Did I say " jerk " ? - but we 're in a wee bit of a hurry . Will you have a drink ? We won 't let it get warm . Come along . Sit down . - Here . Let me - - We 'll just get a glass or two . No , no , no . I can manage this . I know my way around a kitchen . Now , I 'll get right to the point . I like you - both of you . I can tell instantly about people . It 's a gift . I own an island ... off the coast of Costa Rica . I 've leased it from the government , and I 've spent the last five years ... setting up a kind of biological preserve . Really spectacular . Spared no expense . Make the one I 've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo . And there 's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds . And what are those ? Small versions of adults , honey . And not just kids , everyone . We 're going to open next year - that is , if the lawyers don 't kill me first . I don 't care for lawyers . Do you ? - We don 't really know any . - We don 't know any . Well , I do , I 'm afraid . There 's a particular pebble in my shoe represents my investors . Says that they insist on outside opinions . What kind of opinions ? Your kind , not to put too fine a point on it . In your particular field , you 're the top minds ... and if I could just persuade you to sign off on the park - you know , give it your endorsement , maybe even pen a wee testimonial - I could get back on schedule . - Why would they care what we think ? - What kind of park is this ? It 's right up your alley . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't you come down - just the pair of you - for the weekend . I 'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well . I 've got a jet standing by at Choteau . I 'm sorry . This is impossible . We just dug up a new skeleton . I could compensate you by fully funding your dig . And this is a very unusual time . For a further three years . Well - Where 's the plane ? - Yeah . Okay . - Cheers . Okay . Yo ! Dodgson ! You shouldn 't use my name . We 've got Dodgson here ! See ? Nobody cares . Nice hat . What are you trying to look like , a secret agent ? - Well ? - Seven fifty . On delivery , 50,000 more for each viable embryo . That 's 1.5 million , if you get all 15 species off the island . - Oh , I 'll get them all . - Remember - viable embryos . They 're no use to us if they don 't survive . How am I supposed to transport them ? The bottom screws open . That 's great . Oh , God . It 's cooled and compartmentalized inside . You guys - Oh , that 's great . Customs can even check it if they want to . - Let me see . - Go on . - Enough coolant inside for 36 hours . - No menthol ? The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then . That 's up to your guy on the boat . 7 : 00 tomorrow night on the east dock . Make sure he gets it right . How are you planning to beat security ? I 've got an 18-minute window . Eighteen minutes and your company catches up on ten years of research . Don 't get cheap on me , Dodgson . That was Hammond 's mistake . So you two dig up dinosaurs ? Well - We try to . You 'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm . He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality ... especially for a mathematician . Chaotician , actually . John doesn 't subscribe to chaos ... particularly what it has to say about his science project . Codswallop , Ian . You 've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns about the island . Because of the behavior of the system in phase space ? A load , if I may say so , of fashionable number crunching . - Is not . - I do wish you wouldn 't do that . Dr. Sattler , Dr. Grant , you 've heard of chaos theory ? No ? Nonlinear equations ? Strange attractors ? Dr. Sattler , I refuse to believe ... that you aren 't familiar with the concept of attraction . I bring scientists , you bring a rock star . There it is . Bad wind shears . We have to drop pretty fast , so hold on ... 'cause it can be just a little thrilling . Yahoo . You need that piece over there , and that piece - We 'll have landed by the time you get it right . Come along . The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place ? And the concrete moats , and the motion-sensor tracking systems . Donald , dear boy , relax . Try and enjoy yourself . Let 's get something straight , John . This is not a weekend excursion . This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . Your investors , whom I represent , are deeply concerned . Forty-eight hours from now , if they 're not convinced , I 'm not convinced . I 'll shut you down , John . In 48 hours , I 'll be accepting your apologies . All right , slow down here . Stop , stop , stop . This shouldn 't be here . Alan , this species of veriforman 's been extinct ... since the Cretaceous period . This thing is extinct . What ? Look at that . It 's - It 's a dinosaur . You did it . You crazy son of a bitch , you did . We could just tear up the rule book on cold bloodedness . It doesn 't apply . They 're totally wrong . - This is a warm-blooded creature . - This thing doesn 't live in a swamp . This thing 's got what , a 25 , 27-foot neck ? - Brachiosaur ? Thirty . - Thirty feet . We 're gonna make a fortune with this place . How fast are they ? We clocked the T-rex at 32 miles an hour . T - rex ? - You said you 've got a T-rex ? - Uh-huh . Say again ? We have a T-rex . Put your head between your knees . Dr. Grant , my dear Dr. Sattler ... welcome ... to Jurassic Park . They 're moving in herds . They do move in herds . How 'd you do this ? I 'll show you . G 'day , g 'day , g 'day ! Now , the most advanced ... amusement park in the entire world ... incorporating all the latest technologies . And I 'm not talking just about rides . Everybody has rides . We have made living biological attractions so astounding ... that they 'll capture the imagination of the entire planet . So what are you thinking ? We 're out of a job . Don 't you mean " extinct " ? Well , why don 't you all sit down there ? Donald , sit down . Ah . Here he comes - Oh - here I come . Hello . Hello . Say hello . Hello , John . Oh , yes . I 've got lines . Well , fine , I guess . But how did I get here ? Let me show you . First , I 'll need a drop of blood-your blood . John , that hurt . Relax , John . It 's all part of the miracle of cloning . - Hello , John . - Hello , John . Cloned from what ? Blood extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand . Not without massive sequence gaps . Paleo DNA - from what source ? Where do you get 100-million-year-old dinosaur blood ? What ? What ? Mr. DNA . Where did you come from ? From your blood . Just one drop of your blood contains billions of strands of DNA ... the building blocks of life . A DNA strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing ... and sometimes , animals that went extinct millions of years ago-like dinosaurs - left their blueprints behind for us to find . We just had to know where to look . A hundred million years ago ... there were mosquitoes , just like today . And , just like today , they fed on the blood of animals , even dinosaurs . Sometimes , after biting a dinosaur ... the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree ... and get stuck in the sap . After a long time , the tree sap would get hard ... and become fossilized , just like a dinosaur bone ... preserving the mosquito inside . This fossilized tree sap ... which we call " amber " ... waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside ... until Jurassic Park scientists came along . Using sophisticated techniques ... they extract the preserved blood from the mosquito ... and bingo - dino DNA . A full DNA strand contains three billion genetic codes . If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day ... it 'd take two years to look at the entire DNA strand - It 's that long . Since it 's so old , it 's full of holes . Now , that 's where our geneticists take over . Thinking-machine super computers and gene sequencers ... break down the strand in minutes ... and virtual-reality displays show our geneticists ... the gaps in the DNA sequence . We use the complete DNA of a frog to fill in the holes ... and complete the code . And now we can make a baby dinosaur . This score is only temporary . It all has very dramatic music , of course . A march or something . It hasn 't been written yet . And then , of course , the tour moves on . Well , look here . These hard-working cowpokes you see behind the glass - This is overwhelming , John . Are these characters autoerotica ? No , no , no . We have no animatronics here . Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park . The unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs . - Then it 's no - - Wait a minute . How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis ? - Can 't we see the unfertilized eggs ? - Shortly . Now a whole team of genetic engineers - - Can 't you stop these things ? - I 'm sorry . It 's a kind of a ride . One , two , three . Can 't do that . Can they do that ? A reminder - The boat for the mainland will be leaving at 1900 hours . All personnel be at the dock no later than 1845 . No exceptions . G 'day , Henry . Oh , good day , sir . It 's turning the eggs . Oh , perfect timing . I 'd hoped they 'd hatch before I had to go to the boat . Henry , why didn 't you tell me ? I insist ... on being here when they 're born . Come on . Come on , little one . Come on , then . Very good . Push ! - Very good . - Oh , God . There you are . There you are . They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with . That 's it ! Helps them to trust me . I 've been present for the birth ... of every little creature on this island . Well , surely not the ones that have bred in the wilds . - Yes . - Actually they can 't breed in the wild . Population control is one of our security precautions . There 's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park . How do you know they can 't breed ? Because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female . - Oh . - We 've engineered them that way . There you are . Oh , God ! Look at that . Blood temperature seems like a high 80s maybe . - Wu ? - Ninety-one . Homeothermic ? - It holds that temperature ? - Yeah . That 's incredible . But again , how do you know they 're all female ? Does somebody go out in the park ... and pull up the dinosaurs ' skirts ? We control their chromosomes . It 's really not that difficult . All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway . They require an extra hormone given ... at the right developmental stage to make them male . - We simply deny them that . - Deny them that ? John , the kind of control you 're attempting is - It 's not possible . If there 's one thing the history of evolution has taught us ... it 's that life will not be contained . Life breaks free . It expands to new territories and crashes ... through barriers painfully , maybe even dangerously , but - Well , there it is . There it is . You 're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed ? No . I 'm simply saying ... that life finds a way . What species is this ? It 's a velociraptor . You bred raptors ? Dr. Grant , as I was saying ... we laid on lunch for you before you set out into the park . - Our gourmet chef , Alejandro - - What are they doing ? Feeding them . Alejandro has prepared a delightful menu for us . Chilean sea bass , I believe . Shall we ? They should all be destroyed . Robert Muldoon , my game warden from Kenya . Bit of an alarmist , I 'm afraid , but knows more about raptors than anyone . What kind of metabolism do they have ? What 's their growth rate ? They 're lethal at eight months - and I do mean lethal . I 've hunted most things that can hunt you , but the way these things move - - Fast for a biped ? - Cheetah speed . Fifty , sixty miles per hour , if they ever got out in the open . And they 're astonishing jumpers . That 's why we 're taking extreme precautions . - The viewing area set below here - - Do they show intelligence ? - With their brain cavities , we assumed - - They 're extremely intelligent ... even problem-solving intelligence , especially the big one . We bred eight originally , but when she came in ... she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others . That one ... when she looks at you , you can see she 's working things out . That 's why we have to feed them like this . She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . The fences are electrified though , right ? That 's right , but they never attacked the same place twice . They were testing the fences for weaknesses systematically . They remember . Yes , well . Who 's hungry ? More adventurous guests can opt for our jungle river cruise ... or for a close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs - None of these attractions are ready yet ... but the park will open with the basic tour you 're about to take ... and then other rides will come on-line six or twelve months after that . Absolutely spectacular designs . Spared no expense . And we can charge anything we want - 2,000 a day , 10,000 a day - and people will pay it . And then there 's the merchandise . I can personally - This park was not built to cater only for the super rich . Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals . Sure . They will . What , we 'll have a coupon day or something . Gee , the lack of humility before nature ... that 's being displayed here staggers me . Thank you , Dr. Malcolm , but I think things are a little bit different ... - than you and I had feared . - Yeah , I know . They 're a lot worse . Now , wait a second . We haven 't even seen the park yet . - I mean - - No , Donald , let him talk . There 's no reason . I want to hear every viewpoint . - I really do . - Don 't you see the danger ... John , inherent in what you 're doing here ? Genetic power 's the most awesome force the planet 's ever seen ... but you wield it like a kid that 's found his dad 's gun . - It 's hardly appropriate to start - - Just a second . If I may . I 'll tell you the problem with the scientific power you 're using here . It didn 't require any discipline to attain it . You read what others had done and you took the next step . You didn 't earn the knowledge for yourselves ... so you don 't take any responsibility for it . You stood on the shoulders of geniuses ... to accomplish something as fast as you could ... and before you even knew what you had ... you patented it , and packaged it ... and slapped it on a plastic lunch box . And now you 're selling it . You want to sell it . Well - I don 't think you 're giving us our due credit . Our scientists have done things which nobody 's ever done before . But your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could ... they didn 't stop to think if they should . Condors . Condors are on the verge of extinction . If I was to create a flock of condors on this island ... - you wouldn 't have anything to say . - Hold on . This isn 't some species that was obliterated by deforestation ... or the building of a dam . Dinosaurs had their shot ... and nature selected them for extinction . I simply don 't understand this Luddite attitude ... especially from a scientist . How can we stand in the light of discovery and not act ? What 's so great about discovery ? It 's a violent , penetrative act that scars what it explores . What you call discovery ... I call the rape of the natural world . The question is , how can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem ? And therefore , how could you ever assume that you can control it ? You have plants in this building that are poisonous . You picked them because they look good ... but these are aggressive living things that have no idea ... what century they 're in , and they 'll defend themselves - violently , if necessary . Dr. Grant , if there 's one person here ... who could appreciate what I 'm trying to do - The world has just changed so radically ... and we 're all running to catch up . I don 't want to jump to any conclusions , but look . Dinosaurs and man - two species separated by 65 million years of evolution - have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together . How can we possibly have the slightest idea ... of what to expect ? I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it . You 're meant to come down here and defend me against these characters ... and the only one I 've got on my side is the bloodsucking lawyer . Thank you . Well ... they 're here . You four are going to have a spot of company out in the park - spend a little time with our target audience . Grandpa ! Kids ! - Careful with the old man . - We missed you . - Thanks for the presents . - We loved the presents . - They were great . - Did you enjoy the helicopter ? Yeah , it went down , and we all went right up . Now kids , come away . Not too close to the cars . Aren 't they lovely ? Aren 't they glorious , though ? These will be your transports for the afternoon . - No drivers ? - Oh , no . No drivers . They 're electric . They run on this track in the middle of the roadway . Totally non-polluting . Top of the line . Spared no expense . It 's an interactive CD-ROM . You just touch the right part of the screen ... and it talks about whatever you want . Lex , Darling , you 're all right in there . Dr. Sattler , come with me . Dr. Grant , come in the second car . I 'm going with Dr. Sattler . I read your book . Well , that 's - That 's great . Do you really think dinosaurs turned into birds ... and that 's where they all went ? Well , a few species may have evolved along those lines . They sure don 't look like birds to me . I heard that there was this meteor ... hit the Earth someplace down in Mexico and made this big crater . Listen - Tim . Tim . Which car were you planning on ? Whichever one you are . Then I read about this thing in Omni . About this meteor making all this heat ... and it made a bunch of diamond dust . And that changed the weather , and they died because of the weather . And then my teacher tells me about this other book ... by a guy named Bakker , and he says - She said I should ride with you because it would be good for you . The boat is now loading . Everyone must be on the dock for the 1900 hour departure . National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm ... about 75 miles west of us . Why didn 't I build in Orlando ? I 'll keep an eye on it . Maybe it 'll swing south , like the last one . Ray , start the tour program . Hold on to your butts . What kind of dinosaurs are we going to see now ? Hey , look . A ghost . At the door and join the future , right ? Oh , God help us . We 're in the hands of engineers . During most of your tour , the appropriate information ... will be automatically selected and displayed for you . - Hey , look ! - Simply touch the area of the screen ... - displaying the appropriate icon . - Are we gonna hit that ? Welcome to Jurassic Park . What have they got in there , King Kong ? The voice you 're now hearing is Richard Kiley . - We spared no expense . - If you look to the right ... you will see a herd of the first ... dinosaurs on our tour , called dilophosaurus . - Dilophosaurus ! - Oh , shit ! One of the earliest carnivores ... we now know dilophosaurus is actually poisonous ... spitting its venom at its prey , causing ... blindness and eventually paralysis ... allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure . - I can 't see . - This makes dilophosaurus ... a beautiful but deadly addition ... to Jurassic Park . Alan ... where - Damn . Vehicle headlights are on and they 're not responding . Those shouldn 't be running off the car batteries . Item 151 on today 's glitch list . We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo ... and the computers aren 't even on their feet yet . Dennis ... our lives are in your hands , and you have butterfingers ? I 'm totally unappreciated in my time . You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to 3 days . You think that kind of automation is easy ? Or cheap ? You know anybody who can network eight connection machines ... and debug two million lines of code for what I bid for this job ? 'Cause if you can , I 'd love to see him try . I 'm sorry about your financial problems , Dennis , I really am ... but they are your problems . You 're right . You 're absolutely right . Everything 's my problem . I will not get drawn into another financial debate with you , Dennis . - I really will not . - There 's been hardly any debate at all . I don 't blame people for their mistakes ... but I do ask that they pay for them . - Thanks , Dad . - Dennis , the headlights . I 'll debug the tour program when they get back , okay ? Okay ? It 'll eat a lot of compute cycles . We 'll lose part of the system for a while . There 's a finite amount of memory . - You gonna compile for a half an hour ? - Quiet , all of you . They 're approaching the tyrannosaur paddock . God creates dinosaurs . God destroys dinosaurs . God creates man . Man destroys God . Man creates dinosaurs . Dinosaurs ... eat man . Woman inherits the Earth . We 'll try to tempt the rex now . Keep watching the fence . What 's gonna happen to the goat ? He 's gonna eat the goat ? Excellent . What 's the matter , kid ? You never had lamb chops ? I happen to be a vegetarian . T - rex doesn 't want to be fed . He wants to hunt . Can 't just ... suppress 65 million years of gut instinct . Now eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs ... on your dinosaur tour , right ? Hello ? Yes ? I really hate that man . See , the tyrannosaur ... doesn 't obey any set patterns or park schedules . It 's the essence of chaos . I 'm still not clear on chaos . It simply deals with ... unpredictability in complex systems . The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect . A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking ... and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine . Why ? - Did I go too fast ? I did a fly-by . - Yes . Give me that glass of water . We 're going to conduct an experiment . It should be still . The car 's bouncing up and down . But that 's okay . It 's just an example . Put your hand flat , like a hieroglyphic . Now , let 's say a drop of water falls on your hand . Which way is the drop going to roll off ? Which finger ? Thumb , I 'd say . Aha . Okay . Now freeze your hand . Don 't move . I 'm going to do the same thing , start with the same place again . Which way is it gonna roll off ? Let 's say back . The same way . Same way ? Back the same way . It changed . Why ? Because tiny variations - the orientation of the hairs on your hands - Hey , Alan , look at this . amount of blood distending your vessels , imperfections in the skin - - Imperfections in the skin ? - Microscopic . And never repeat , and vastly affect the outcome . - That 's what ? - Unpredictability . Right . There . Look at this . See ? I 'm right again . Nobody could 've predicted that Dr. Grant ... would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle . There 's another example . See ? Here I am now by myself , talking to myself . That 's chaos theory . Stop the program . I 've told you how many times ... we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors . Stopping park vehicles and rebooting program . We 're on . Will notify for resume . Like I was saying , there 's this other book by a guy named Bakker ... and he says the dinosaurs died ... - of a bunch of diseases . - Where are we going ? You see something ? Is there anybody else who thinks we shouldn 't be out here ? And his book was a lot fatter than yours was . - Really ? - Yours was fully illustrated , honey . - Hey . - You okay ? Hey , look at this . Hey , watch . Hey , come on ! Watch this ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Everybody stay here . - Okay ? - Of course . Don 't be scared . It 's okay . Muldoon tranquilized her for me . She 's sick . Oh , my God . Hey , baby . Hey , baby girl . She was my favorite when I was a kid . Now I see her , she 's the most beautiful thing I ever saw . It 's okay . Microvesicles . That 's interesting . Thanks . What are her symptoms ? Imbalance , disorientation , labored breathing . - Right . - Seems to happen about every six weeks . Six weeks . These are dilated . - They are ? - Take a look . - It 's okay . - I 'll be damned . That 's pharmacological ... from local plant life . Is this West Indian Lilac ? Yes . We know they 're toxic , but the animals don 't eat them . - You sure ? - Pretty sure . There 's only one way to be positive . I 'd have to see the dinosaur 's droppings . Dino - Droppings ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I got that . That storm center hasn 't dissipated or changed course . We 're gonna have to cut the tour short , I 'm afraid . Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off . - Are you sure we have to ? - It 's not worth taking the chance . - Sustained winds , 45 knots . - Tell them when they get in the car . Ladies and gentlemen , the last shuttle leaving for the dock ... leaves in approximately five minutes . Drop what you 're doing and leave now . Damn ! That is one big pile of shit . You 're right . There 's no trace of lilac berries . It 's so odd , though . All right . So she 's suffering from melia toxicity ... every six weeks . Let 's see . Rats . Nada . She 's tenacious . You have no idea . You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything ? Doctors , if you please , I have to insist that we get moving . If it 's okay , I 'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the trike . Sure . I 'm in a gas-powered Jeep . I can drop her at the visitors ' center before I make the boat . Great . Then I 'll catch up with you . - You sure ? - I wanna stay with her a bit longer . - Okay , then . - Okay . Now ! There 's nothing I can do . The captain says we gotta go , we gotta go ! Give me the time . I did a test run on this thing . It took me 20 minutes . I could maybe push it to 18 , but you gotta give me at least 15 minutes . No promises ! Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage . So much for our first tour . Two no-shows and ... one sick triceratops . It could 've been worse , John . A lot worse . Anybody want a soda ? I 'm going to the machine . I thought , maybe I 'd get somebody something . I 've had only sweets , and I 'm gonna get something salty . I thought maybe somebody would - Oh , I finished debugging the phones . I was gonna - So I did . You told me to , so I debugged the phones . I should tell you the system is gonna be compiling ... for 18 to 20 minutes . Some of the minor systems might go on or off , but it 's nothing to worry about . It 's a simple thing . You got any kids ? Oh , hell , yeah , three . I love kids . Anything at all can and does happen . Same with wives , for that matter . - You married ? - Occasionally . Yeah , I 'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs . Malcolm . Five , four ... three , two , one . That 's odd . What ? Door security systems shutting down . Well , Nedry said a few systems would go off-line , didn 't he ? By the way , Dr. Sattler ... she 's not , like , available , is she ? Why ? Yeah , I 'm sorry . You two are - Yeah . Hey , what 'd I touch ? You didn 't touch anything . We stopped . Whoa , whoa . What the hell ? - What now ? - Fences are failing all over the park . Find Nedry ! Check the vending machines . Look at this work station . What a complete slob . The raptor fences aren 't out , are they ? No , no . They 're still on . Why the hell would he turn the other ones off ? Access main program . Access main security . Access main program grid . Uh , uh , uh . You didn 't say the magic word . Please ! Goddamn it ! I hate this hacker crap ! Call Nedry 's people in Cambridge . Phones are out too . Where did the vehicles stop ? Their radio 's out too . Gennaro said to stay put . - Kids okay ? - I didn 't ask . Why wouldn 't they be ? - Kids get scared . - What 's to be scared about ? I didn 't say I was scared . - I didn 't say you were scared . - I know . Boo ! - Hey , where did you find those ? - In a box under my seat . - Are they heavy ? - Yeah . Then they 're expensive . Put ' em back . Don 't scare me . Oh , cool . Night vision . Do you feel that ? Maybe it 's the power tryin ' to come back on . What is that ? Where 's the goat ? Oh , Jesus ! He left us . He left us . Where does he think he 's going ? When you gotta go , you gotta go . Dr. Grant ? Boy , do I hate being right all the time . Keep absolutely still . Its vision is based on movement . Turn the light off . Turn the light off . Turn the light off ! . - Turn it off ! . - I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! No ! Hey ! Oh , God . Ian , freeze ! Get the kids ! Get rid of the flare ! - Get the kids ! - Get rid of the flare ! Hail Mary , full of grace . The Lord be with me - - Dr. Grant ! - Okay , Lex , I got ya . I 'm stuck ! The seat 's got my feet ! I 'll get you next . You 're okay . You 're all right . Tim ! Tim ? Don 't move . He can 't see us if we don 't move . This way - Wait , wait , wait ! Lex ! Lex ! You 're chokin ' me ! Grab the wire ! " Keycheck space minus O , keychecks off , safety space minus O. " He 's turned safety systems off . Doesn 't want anybody to see what he 's doing . Now , look at this next entry . It 's the kicker . " White rabbit object . " It did it all . With the keychecks off , the computer didn 't file the keystrokes . Only way to find them is to go through the computer 's lines of code one by one . - How many lines of code are there ? - About two million . - Two million ? - Yeah . Robert , I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough ... to take a gas jeep ... and bring back my grandchildren . Sure . I 'm going with him . I can 't get Jurassic Park back on-line without Dennis Nedry . Should have been there by now . No damn good . Oh , damn ! There 's the road ! Winch this sucker off the thing and then I tie it to that thing and then I ... pull down this thing here and I - My glasses ! I can afford more glasses . Oh , geez ! You got time , you got time . You can do it ! You can do it . Come on , Dennis ! Hello ? Yeah , yeah , that 's nice . Gotta go . Nice boy . Nice boy ! Nice dinosaur . I thought you were one of your big brothers . You 're not so bad . What do you want ? You want food ? Look at me . I just fell down a hill . I 'm soakin ' wet . I don 't have any food ! I have no food on me . I have nothing on me . Play fetch ? Play fetch ? Look , see ? See stick ? See stick ? Yeah , look , stick . Look , stick ! Stick , stupid ! Fetch the stick , boy ! You like the stick ? No wonder you 're extinct . I 'm gonna run you over when I come back down . Now , Lex , listen , listen to me . I 'm right here . I 'm gonna look after you , but I have to go help your brother . So I want you to stay right here and wait for me ! He left us . He left us ! But that 's not what I 'm gonna do . Okay ? Stay here . You hear me ? I 'm coming up . I hate climbing . I hate trees . Way too high . Goddamn tree . You okay ? You okay ? I threw up . Oh , that 's okay . Just give me your hand . I won 't tell anyone you threw up . Just give me your hand . Here , I gotcha . Come on . That 's good . Over the wheel . - Don 't pull me too hard . - No hurry . Stand on the door . Hang onto me . Okay , I got you . - That 's not too bad , right ? - Yes , it is . Just like coming out of a tree house . Did your dad ever build you one ? - No ! - Yeah , me too . - Thing about climbing , never look down ! - This is impossible . - How am I gonna do this ? It 's about 50 - - I 'm gonna help you - Oh , no . Tim , go ! Go , go , go ! Faster ! Jump ! Go ! Well , we 're back in the car again . Well , at least you 're out of the tree . Where 's the other car ? I think this was Gennaro . I think this was too . - I think it 's ahead of us . - It could be anywhere . With the fences down , it can wander in and out any paddock it likes . He put a tourniquet on . Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend . Can we chance moving him ? Please chance it . Ellie , come on ! Wait . The other car ! They 're not here . Anybody hear that ? It 's an impact tremor is what it is . I 'm fairly alarmed here . Come on . We gotta get outta here . Now , now ! Right now ! Go , go , go ! Let 's go ! Start the engine ! Must go faster . - Here it comes ! Fifth gear ! - Shit ! Shit ! Get off the stick ! Bloody move ! - Look out ! - Down ! Think they 'll have that on the tour ? Are you hearing this ? Come on , Tim . Come on , hurry up . Let 's get up this tree . Come on . It 's okay . Try up here . I don 't want to . Oh , man . - I hate trees . - They don 't bother me . Oh , yeah , well , you weren 't in the last one . Hey , those are brontosauruses . I mean , brachiosaurs . They 're singing . - Don 't let the monsters come over here ! - They 're not monsters , Lex . They 're just animals . These are herbivores . That means they only eat vegetables , but for you they 'd make an exception . Oh , I hate the other kind . The other kind just do what they do . What 's that ? What will you and Ellie do if you don 't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore ? I don 't know . I guess we 'll just have to evolve too . What do you call a blind dinosaur ? What do you call a blind dinosaur ? Do-you-think-he-saurus . What about a blind dinosaur 's dog ? You got me . A do-you-think-he-saurus ' Rex . What if the dinosaurs come back while we 're asleep ? Well , I 'll stay awake . All night ? All night . They were all melting . Malcolm 's okay for now . I gave him a shot of morphine . They 'll be fine . Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert ? You know the first ... attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland ... was a flea circus , Petticoat Lane . Really quite wonderful . We had a wee trapeze and ... a merry-go - A carousel . And a seesaw . They all moved . Motorized , but people would say they could see the fleas . " Oh , I can see the fleas , Mummy . Can 't you see the fleas ? " Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade . But with this place ... I wanted to show them something that wasn 't an illusion . Something that was real . Something that they could ... see and touch . An aim not devoid of merit . But you can 't think through this one . You have to feel it . You 're right . You 're absolutely right . Hiring Nedry was an obvious mistake . We 're overdependent on automation . I can see that now . Now , the next time , everything 's correctable . Creation ... is an act of sheer will . Next time , it 'll be flawless . It 's still the flea circus . It 's all an illusion . When we have control again - You 've never had control . That 's the illusion ! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place ! But I made a mistake too . I didn 't have enough respect for that power and it 's out now . The only thing that matters now are the people we love . Alan and Lex and Tim . John , they 're out there where people are dying . It 's good . Spared no expense . - Go away ! - It 's okay . It 's a brachiosaur . It 's a veggie-saurus , Lex . Veggie . Come on . Come on , girl . Come on . Come on , baby . All right ! I 'm not letting go . - Looks like it has a cold . - Yeah , maybe . - Can I touch it ? - Sure . Just think of it as kind of a big cow . I like cows . Hey , come on , girl . Come on up here , girl . Come on . Up here . God bless you ! Oh , great . Now she 'll never try anything new . She 'll just sit in her room and never come out and play on her computer . - I 'm a hacker ! - That 's what I said . You 're a nerd . I am not a computer nerd . I prefer to be called a hacker . Oh , God . You know what this is ? It 's a dinosaur egg . The dinosaurs are breeding . But , my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls . Amphibian DNA . What 's that ? Well , on the tour , the film said they used ... frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps . They mutated the dinosaur genetic code ... and blended it with that of frogs . Now , some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex ... from male to female in a single-sex environment . Malcolm was right . Look . Life found a way . No , no , no , that 's crazy . You 're out of your mind . He 's absolutely out of his mind . Wait a minute . What exactly would this mean ? We 're talking about a calculated risk , which is the only option left to us . We will never find the command that Nedry used . He 's covered his tracks far too well . I think it 's obvious now that he 's not coming back . So , shutting down the entire system - You can get somebody else , because I won 't do it . Shutting down the system ... is the only way to wipe out everything that he did . Now , as I understand it , all the systems will then come back ... on their original start-up mode , correct ? Theoretically , yes . But we 've never shut down the entire system before . - It may not come back on at all . - Will we get the phones back ? Yes . Again , in theory . What about the lysine contingency ? - We could put that into effect . - What 's that ? That is absolutely out of the question . The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals ... in case they ever get off the island . Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism . The animals can 't manufacture the amino acid lysine . Unless they 're supplied with lysine by us , they slip into a coma and die . People are dying . Will you please shut down the system ? Hold onto your butts . It 's okay . Look . See that ? It 's on . It worked . What do you mean , it worked ? Everything 's still off . Maybe the shutdown tripped the circuit breakers . All we have to do is turn them on , reboot a few systems - telephones , security doors , half a dozen others , but it worked . - System 's ready . - Where are the breakers ? Maintenance shed , the other end of the compound . Three minutes , I can have power back on in the entire park . Just to be safe , I want everybody in the emergency bunker ... until Mr. Arnold returns and the whole system is running again . - I 'm tired . I 'm hot . - My legs hurt . Just keep going , guys . The visitors ' center is just about a mile over that rise . Just keep - What is that ? Tim , can you tell me what they are ? Gallimimus . Are those meat eating ? " Meat-asaurusses " ? Look at the wheeling . Uniform direction changes ... just like a flock of birds evading a predator . They 're flocking this way . - I wanna go now . - Just look how it eats . Please . I bet you never look at birds the same way again . Yes . Go now . Okay . Keep low and follow me . Look how much blood . Oh , God . Something went wrong . Something 's happened . Something 's wrong . This is just a delay , that 's all it is . All major theme parks have delays . When they opened Disneyland in 1956 , nothing worked . But if Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down , the pirates don 't eat tourists . I can 't wait anymore . Something went wrong . I 'm gonna go get the power back on . You can 't just stroll down the road , you know . Don 't let 's be too hasty . He 's only been gone - I 'm going with you . Sorry . Now , this isn 't going to be just like switching on the kitchen light ... but I think I can follow this and then talk you through it . Right . But it ought to be me really going . - Why ? - Well , I 'm - And you 're - - Look . - Come on . Let 's go . We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back . You just take me through this step-by-step . I 'm on channel two . Right . Oh , God . Oh , God . The shutdown must have turned off all the fences . Damn it , even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fences . Come on , this way . I can see the shed from here . We can make it if we run . No . We can 't . Why not ? Because we 're being hunted . - Oh , God . - In the bushes , straight ahead . It 's all right . Like hell it is . Run . Towards the shed . I 've got her . Go ! Now ! Mr. Arnold ? Mr. Arnold ? John , I 'm in . Great . Now ... ahead of you is a metal staircase . Go down it . Okay . Going down . After 20 or 30 feet you come to a T-junction . Take a left . - Have her follow the main cable . - I understand how to read a schematic . I guess that means the power 's off . - That 's not funny . - That was great . Well , maybe , we could - Damn it . Dead end . Wait a minute , wait a minute . There should have been a right turn back there somewhere . Ellie , look above you . There should be a large bundle of cable and pipes heading in the same direction . Follow that . Okay . Following the piping . I bet I could climb over the top ... and be on the other side before you could get to the top . - What would you give me ? - Respect . Come on , guys , it 's not a race . I see the box . It says " high voltage . " Good . Here we go . Over the top . Take your time , Tim . That 's good . Come on . Find your footing . Find your footing . Ellie , you can 't throw the main switch by hand . You 've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge . It 's large , flat and gray . All right , here I go . Okay ? One , two ... three , four . Okay . Charged . Under the words " contact position " ... there 's a round , green button which says , " push to close . " " Push to close . " Okay . Push it . Now , Ellie , the red buttons turn on the individual park systems . Switch ' em on . - Get down now ! - You 're gonna have to jump ! You crazy ? I 'm not gonna jump . - Do what Dr. Grant says ! - Let go ! I 'll count to three ! One , two , three ! Control room . Tour . I 'm coming up to get you . I 've gotta get Tim . Okay . I 'm gonna count to three . One ... two - He 's not breathing . Mr. Hammond , I think we 're back in business ! Oh , my God ! Goddamn ! Oh , Mr. Arnold . Clever girl . Good boy . Good boy . Good boy . Good boy , Tim . Three . Hello ? Okay . I 'm gonna have to find the others ... get you to a doctor . Lex , you look after Tim . Hey ! Your hair is all sticking up . Big Tim , the human piece of toast . I 'll be back soon . I promise . Run . It 's just the two raptors , right ? You sure the third one 's contained ? Yes . Unless they figure out how to open doors . Timmy , what is it ? It 's a velociraptor . It 's inside . Follow me . It 's in there . Control room . - We can call for help ? - We gotta reboot the system first . The door locks ! Ellie , boot up the door locks ! God ! Boot up the door locks ! Ellie , get back ! Boot up the door locks ! You can 't hold it by yourself ! . It 's a UNIX system . I know this . It 's all the files of the whole park . It tells you everything . I gotta find the right file . Try to reach the gun ! I can 't get it unless I move . This might be the right file . Wait . It 's coming . This isn 't the right file . Come on , Lex ! - You got it ? - Yes ! You got it ! Yes ! Yes , this is it ! What works ? Phones , security systems . You name it , we got it . Mr. Hammond , the phones are working . - The children all right ? - The children are fine . Call the mainland . Tell ' em to send the damn helicopters . Gonna come through the glass ! Move ! Quick ! Tim , move ! Tim , let go . Yeah . Hold onto me ! After careful consideration , I 've decided not to endorse your park . So have I. It 's okay , it 's okay . Come on .

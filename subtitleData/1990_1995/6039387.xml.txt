 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ music playing ] Hello . Anyone home ? Yoo-hoo , Mr. Wizard . [ gasps ] It 's true . He did it . Lex , what is it ? What is it ? This is the most amazing invention in the history of the human species . Yeah , but what does it do ? This , my mumble-headed sweetheart , is an inter-dimensional portal . Oh . - Whoa . - Lex , be careful . [ laughing maniacally ] Lex ! Lex . Those aren 't alien bones . They 're from a cow . So ? They don 't have cows on other planets ? None I 've ever been to . Clark , you seen Lana ? She 's got a report due . Not today . I 'll take care of the report . I couldn 't interest you in a couple of sides of beef , could I ? Real cheap . Thanks anyway . Is this the Bureau of Extra-Normal Matters ? What else could this place be ? Great . This is for whoever 's in charge . What 's that ? A hair , a red hair . Oh , man , eww ! Are you gonna sign for this or what ? Thanks . [ rock music playing ] [ music stops ] - Where 's Lana ? - Lana ? Who 's Lana ? " Anyone wants to see Lana Lang again , send Superboy to Dr. Winger 's lab at Shuster University . No police . " I 'm sorry . I 'll do what I can to help , but I didn 't write this . - Then who did ? - I did . Darla . You and Lex took Lana ? Nope , just me . And you 're never gonna see her again unless you save Lex . Save him ? He fell into that thing . I didn 't know what to do . So I did what Lex does when he has a problem that he can 't solve . I kidnapped Lana . Look , Darla , I 'll do what I can . But you gotta let Lana go . No , not until I get Lex back . And it better be within 24 hours , too . Because after that , it 's too late . Don 't try anything , Superboy . She dies whether I 'm there or not . And you 'll never find her without me . If Luthor fell into the portal , there 's no telling where he is . What does this thing do ? Twelve years of my life and you want me to explain it in two seconds ? Will you just give him the Cliffs Notes ? All right . Ever hear of the alternate worlds theory ? Well , some people think there 's trillions of ' em , all in different dimensional planes . Every time there 's an accident , or someone makes a decision or doesn 't make a decision , a whole new world is created just like here . So it 's like a time machine ? No , no , no , no . Not like a time machine . That 's been done before . There 's no movement along the temporal continuum . It 's about worlds diverging at the crucial points . Roads not taken . Worlds where wars are won by the other side . Where history is totally different . Can this thing get me to one of those other worlds ? I haven 't really tested it yet . Well , I think you 've got your guinea pig . Yeah , but I don 't know where it will take you . I don 't know if I can get you back . Superboy , you find him or Lana dies . Well , I guess I don 't have any other choice , do I ? [ coughs ] [ shivers ] Lex . [ spits ] Die , Superboy , die . Die , Superboy , die . Die , Superboy , die ! - Die , Superboy , die . - Die , Superboy . Die , Superboy . Die , Superboy , die ! Spare any change ? Just a couple of cents . Lana . I didn 't think I 'd ever see you again . What happened to you ? I didn 't deserve this . Deserve what ? I was there for you . I was the only one left and you couldn 't even look me in the eye . I believed in you , everything you stood for . What is it that you think I did ? Think ? I know you did it . I saw you . I saw you . We all hated him , but he didn 't deserve what you did to him . Whatever it is , I didn 't do it . Shut up . Go to Eastlake Cemetery , section 6 , row D. Then tell me you didn 't do it . [ chanting ] Lex ! Lex ! Lex ! Lex ! [ man ] Luthor ! [ chanting continuing ] Rejoice , for I am resurrected . - Yes ! Yes ! - [ cheering ] I am resurrected . But why did I wait so long ? That must be what you 're asking . Immediately after the murder , I could have come forth and shown the world that Superboy had only murdered an impostor . Why did I wait ? Because I was waiting for you . I was waiting for each and every one of you to open your eyes and see what I saw from the very beginning . That our noble virtuous Superboy was really a spineless , murderous vicious hypocrite ! [ cheering ] You see , you see , everyone needs heroes . You do . You do . I know you do . And I do , too . That 's right . I 'm just like you . I worshipped him , too . He was my hero , too . I trusted him . I believed in him . I loved him . My God ! I would have named my children after him . But then I saw one pure shining truth . I saw and it was as looking into a mirror . I saw and now you see , too . And though we are few , soon we will be many . Soon one truth will be in the eyes and on the lips of all our brothers and sisters . And the multitudes shall rise up and one vision , one voice , one truth will echo from the mountaintops , and the heavens will answer . Lex ! Lex ! Lex ! Lex ! [ chanting continuing ] Why don 't you just send Air Force One for me ? I 'm not proud . Oh , that 'll be perfect . Tell me , how 's Barb ? That 's beautiful . Be sure to give those grandkids , my love , all right ? OK , ciao , babe . Lex Luthor . No , wait , no , please , don 't kill me . I 'm not who you think I am . Take it easy . I 'm only here to take you home . - Home ? - Where you came from . Oh , it 's only you . You 're the other Superboy . My , my , my . What a fascinating turn of events . Tell me , how 'd you get here ? Same way you did . I had to make a deal with Darla . She wants you back . You know , I 'm gonna miss that woman . But on the other hand , there 's probably a Darla in this world , too . Maybe one day I 'll run into her . I don 't think so . I 'm not going anywhere . In this world , I 'm practically a God . [ groans ] Do you think I 'm so stupid as to go into the public in a world where my killer is still at-large ? Not without insurance ! [ clamoring ] It 's him ! It 's Superboy . Kill him ! [ cheering ] Matt . - Don 't hurt me . - Wait . What happened ? We 're closed . That 's all . Nobody cares about this stuff anymore . Nobody . I saw you flying here . Who the hell are you ? I 'm a version of you from another world . It 's in a different dimension . Tell me something . Would you believe that ? And would you believe that I know that we 're both Clark Kent ? Did you kill Luthor ? - Did you ? - He was gonna get away again . He always got away . Do you remember the time he kidnapped those children who later died ? - I remember . - Do you remember how angry you were ? So angry you could almost do anything ? What did you do about it ? I fought it . I had to . I almost ... I did . I used my heat vision . Cut him right in two . Don 't look at me like that . What 's in me is inside you , too . I gave in . Except this is what would happen if I did kill him . So ? All that hero stuff is outdated anyway . Is that what Lana believed ? Is that why you don 't wear the suit anymore ? Or is it because you 're ashamed ? It 's all hopeless . No , it isn 't . You still have a chance . I used to be that naive . Remember you said you know what 's inside of me ? Well , I know what 's in your heart , too . [ rock music playing ] [ pounding on door ] All right , all right ! Why don 't you just use dynamite ? Whoa . Whoa ! Just kidding . Dr. Winger . You look just like him . I need a favor . Darla , I 'm freezing . So freeze . I mean , I wasn 't sure if I should have called you . I mean , you 're busy with that whole resurrection thing . No , no , no , no . There 's always time to appreciate a fellow scientist . Tell me , just what is it this thing does ? You know exactly what it does , Luthor . I don 't know what you 're talking about . It 's how you got here , same as me . And it 's how you 're going back . Come on , let 's go home . [ grunting ] You know , you keep underestimating me , Superboy . [ laughing ] [ music playing ]

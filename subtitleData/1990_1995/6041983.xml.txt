 [ Announcer ] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . Five thousand copies and they put them on the remainder racks . It was a good book , Levi . Yeah , but if they promoted it , I coulda had a best seller . They tried . A quarter-page ad and a 15-minute reading in a book store ? [ scoffs ] I shoulda done television or magazines . But then again , who wants to see an old Jew on a talk show ? That 's ridiculous , you can 't ... Don 't tell me what 's ridiculous ! Were you there during the Depression , the War ? You don 't know . Yeah , we 've been through all this before , Levi . [ sighs ] It 's affected me my whole life . Where do you think I 'd be right now if it hadn 't been for that ? Face it , you write books about mysticism in the Dark Ages , that just isn 't relevant anymore . Just ... [ wood breaking ] Let go of me ! Not again . Hey , you kids ! What are you doing ? [ grunts ] Still think the Dark Ages aren 't relevant ? The police will take care of them . It 's always someone else , isn 't it ? That 's why it never gets done ! What are you getting at , Levi ? You 've got to fight hatred with hatred . Have our people survived for thousands of years so that we can become ... them ? Thousands of years of persecution ! It 's time we fought back ! I 've been working on a way to do it . [ grunting ] [ chanting ] [ clay cracking ] [ laughs ] [ clay cracking ] [ kitten mewling ] [ grunting ] Come . Come , come . Listen to me . I am your creator . Your only purpose is to eradicate the world of bigots . All of them . They must be destroyed . Annihilated . Crushed . I will tell you who these men are . Do you understand me ? It 's called a golem . That 's g-o-l-e-m . Yeah . They 're supposed to have enormous strength . Legend says that during the Middle Ages they helped to protect the Jews . And you think your friend 's created one of these things ? [ sighs ] I don 't know what to think . Levi 's always been interested in the kabbalah . It 's a collection of ancient Jewish mysticism that among other things tells how to make a golem . Most people dismiss it but Levi believes in it . You 're saying anyone can buy this book and create one ? No , no , no . It would take something else as well . With Levi I think it 's his hatred , there 's so much emotion there and maybe the ritual helps to transfer it . Why would he do it ? To take care of this group of neo-Nazi kids we 've got in the neighborhood . He despises them . And you said the golem 's made from mud ? Well , that 's what the book says . Then it shouldn 't be too hard to find . No , no . Once it comes out of the mud it looks like a normal human . Levi tried to tell me that this guy was his border but I don 't know . How can someone tell the difference ? The Hebrew sign of life . - Uh , may I ? - Mm-hmm . It would be right over his heart . Or it could just be a tattoo . Couldn 't it ? Yeah , I guess it could just be a tattoo . And I guess I could just be crazy , too . And I probably was for coming in here . Wait a minute . No , look . I 'm sorry I 've wasted your time . What do we do now ? File it . Kind of far-fetched ? I don 't know wouldn 't be the first time a monster was created out of hatred . Didn 't you people get our message ? We don 't want your kind around here . [ Levi ] Maybe it 's time we sent a message back ! Well , well , well . What have we here ? You 're that Jew writer , aren 't you ? We hate your kind most of all . Hate ? [ chuckles ] You don 't know what hate is . This is what a bigot looks like . Go ahead . [ choking ] I 'd say the message has been received . [ laughs ] Where are you going ? Stop ! Get him off me ! Stop ! Enough ! Enough ! [ grunts ] [ grunts ] Chief , we got some food here . [ Clark ] Lana , even if a golem is responsible for what happened , Stopping every garbage man , bodybuilder and professional wrestler in the neighborhood is no way to find it . [ Lana ] There 's only a couple of more streets west of here . [ siren blaring ] Looks like there 's some trouble up ahead . It has to be the golem . - I better go . - Where ? To get more police . There 's plenty police . [ air rushing ] [ gunshots ] [ brakes squealing ] Listen up ! Listen to this : " I often grew sick to my stomach from the smell of these caftan wearers . Added to this was their unclean dress and their genuinely unheroic appearance . " Incredible . [ chattering ] It 's Mein Kampf . Not the book , the fact that you can read . What do you want ? I came here to warn you . There 's a golem that 's been created to destroy your group . Is that right ? Just ask your friend in the hospital . So why would you want to protect us ? Maybe you sympathize with us more than you care to admit . I protect everyone 's right to their own beliefs . No matter how repulsive they might be . [ murmuring ] [ sighs ] [ gasps ] I thought you were going back to the bureau ? I-I was , but I thought the golem might come here . Looks like you 're not the only one with that idea . [ car starting ] He 's the guy that helped the golem get away . Who is this guy ? My name is Daniel . Question is : Who are you ? Clark Kent and Lana Lang . We work for the Bureau for Extranormal Matters . Oh , amateurs . What are you doing in my home ? You 're the guy who helped the golem get away from Superboy . Why , I suppose you could look at it that way . What I actually did was protect Superboy from the golem . Oh , really ? You don 't have any idea what you 're dealing with here , do you ? We know the legend . So do I. I 've been studying it for years , and believe me it 's a lot more than a legend . But if anyone can stop this thing , it 's gotta be Superboy . There 's only one way to stop a golem , the mark over his heart must be removed . Well , then that 's what he 'll do . Look , a golem isn 't necessarily evil . With the proper training , it can evolve into a force for good . Well , what are we supposed to do in the meantime ? Two things : One , stay out of my way , and two , let me handle it . [ bolt locking ] Hey ! [ man ] It 's for your own good . We 'll never get that off and it 's solid metal . There 's gonna be a march tonight in less than an hour . They 're out of their minds . Look at this ! I found a trap door . [ coughing ] Breathe , breathe deep . - I gotta talk to him ! - No . - It 's the only chance ! - He 'll kill you ! [ man ] Help me ! Help me ! Listen to me , will you ? I 'm here to help you ! I know what Levi said to you but it 's not gonna stop them . All it 's going to do is create more hatred , is that what you want ? [ coughing ] There 's another choice , you don 't have to kill . [ boy whimpering ] No ! Listen to me ! You have a choice ! Do you hear me ? You have a choice ! No , don 't . Shalom . I couldn 't get through to him . How did you get out ? - The back . - But ... He was just doing what he was taught . Like them . Will they ever stop ? There 's always hope . I feel sorry for the victims . Who 's going to protect them now ? I wouldn 't worry about that .

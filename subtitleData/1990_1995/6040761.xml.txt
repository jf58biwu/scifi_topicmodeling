But this other line , it wasn 't here before . What is it ? It 's another lifeline . From what ? From that thing . It 's got to be . It 's in there with him . Feeding on him . Killing him . [ computer noise ] Every time Superboy enters the nightmare phase , the creature grows . How could that be ? I 'm not sure . It 's not as if the dreams are real . No , but the emotions they cause are real . And emotions generate adrenaline . You 're saying it 's feeding on his adrenaline . It would explain why it 's growing . Doctor , could it be creating the dreams ? Trying to frighten him into producing more adrenaline ? Lana ? Lana , help me . Lana , please . I can 't do it anymore . It 's too difficult . Lana , what are you talking about . Everything that has happened to me , that 's what I 'm talking about . The times I 've been victimized and almost killed . It 's been all because of you . Because I loved you . I love you , but you just don 't ... Do you ... Of course . Then why can 't you show me . Why can 't we just do the simple things that everybody else does ? Seems like the only time I ever get to see you is when you save me . You can lift a mountain , and fly around the world , but you can 't take me out for dinner or dancing or just to a movie . Do you know , how lonely I am ? You know why we can 't do those things . My enemies , they ... That 's just an excuse . You 're holding back and you always will . Lana , no I won 't , I promise . I won 't . It 's too late . Too late . You always expected me to wait for you . But for what ? When is it ever going to be any different ? I found someone else . No . He 's kind and decent ... Who ? And he 's always been there for me . He 's tangible . Who is he ? I can be with him , and my life isn 't at risk . Clark ? I always loved her . She just never realized it . But I do now . Lana . It 's a trick . Don 't be jealous . He 's not Clark . How do you know ? Because I know . Stop it . Tell her you 're not Clark . You 're gonna ruin everything .

 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family , and raised as Clark Kent . He learned he possessed the strength of steel the speed of light , and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy . [ theme music ] ( male # 1 ) Then the other night , Danny 's tool started disappearing . We figured theft , right ? Uh-hn . We found him a pile in the corner , twisted and mutilated . And let me tell you , brother no human could have done what we saw . Well , what do you think is causing ' it ? Uh , phantom lights , unexplained voices mutilated tools , you tell me . I will say this , if something happens tonight some of these boys said they 're not coming tomorrow . - Goodnight . - Goodnight . So , do you tell Jackson , or do I ? To me it sounds like a ploy to get hazard pay . Well , I 've had too much fun for one day . Don 't go yet . Afraid of ghosts ? No . Spelling . Can you proof me ? [ creaking ] ( Lana ) This construction 's driving me crazy . They 're not working upstairs . [ intense music ] [ creaking continues ] Oh , it 's just the wind , I 'll get it . [ intense music ] - Clark , help ! - Lana ! How did you do that ? I don 't know , must have been adrenaline . What happened ? The wind blew me out . It came from behind me . From inside the building ? That 's impossible . [ beeping ] I suppose the punch line is that you haven 't finished the report . No , the punch line is that this place is haunted . What she 's saying is true , sir . A jiggling picture . Hmph , hmph . Like you said , the wind . Add to that all of the work that 's been rattling this building , I 'd say ghosts are pretty far down on the list of probable causes . - What about- - - Wind currents are complex . A sudden gust of wind up this high , isn 't that unusual . From inside the room . Look , now , how do you explain that , huh ? Sorry , Louie 's testing the breakers . - Breakers , huh ? - ' Yeah . ' But there is something down here you should see . ( male # 1 ) It 's a retaining wall . - So ? - Well , it 's not in the plans . Must 've been added later . It 's gonna take some time to break through . Wonder what 's in there . Whatever it is , it 's covered by a lot of lead paint . ( Clark ) Wait a minute . Look at that . I bet it 's from The Trocadel . The what ? The Trocadel , before the government bought this place in the 30 's there was a ballroom here called The Trocadel . A wild place . [ trumpet music ] [ applause ] ( male # 2 ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you , Capital City we 're going to miss you . But the night is young and our lease doesn 't run out until midnight . So , we 're gonna take a break and be back in a minute . Thank you . [ applause ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ instrumental music ] You meant it , didn 't you , Johnny ? We 're leaving tonight at midnight , like you promised ? I need a little time . Jeno wants me to do an errand . Don 't do it , Johnny . It 's not an errand , and it 's a crime . You 're too good for that . Your new life starts at midnight with me . You 're right . Go get your things and meet me here at midnight . - I 'm gonna go talk to Jeno . - You 'll be here when I 'm back ? I 'll meet you right here . I 'll wait forever , if I have to , I promise . [ music continues ] - Clark , come here , quick . - What ? An old 30 's song was just on . So ? On every station , the same song . - Big band , like at a ballroom . - Maybe it 's just a coincidence . No , it 's more than that . Don 't you feel it ? There 's something going on here , something not right . I just can 't put my finger on it . Whatever it is , you better forget it . Jackson was pretty adamant . Promise me , you 'll forget about it . [ intense music ] You 're not supposed to be here until we close . Well , we 're pretty excited about this . And from what you said , I think we have a definite presence here . - You 'll have to come back . - What 's going on here ? Nothing , nothing . There couldn 't be less going on here . I 'm Dennis Jackson , Bureau Chief . Louise Larsen , paranormal specialist . And this is my partner Ben Ransell , psychic . That explains everything . They 're gonna take a check . They 'll work at night and- - That 's not the point . They have a research van and they 'll work for free . For free ? Why didn 't you say so ? Well ... have at it . But there had better not be a book , file or paper out of place when I get back in the morning . No problem . Great . [ beeping ] What 's in this wall ? ( Clark ) That 's what we 'd all like to know . They trying to take it down safely . I 'm sensing something in there . ( Clark ) We already looked in there . Looks like you missed something . That wasn 't there before . Don 't feel bad , huh , I have a gift . I wonder who it belonged to . [ jazz music ] How 's it goin ' , boys ? Fine . We got 20 minutes to get in and out . That should be easy with the three of you . Yeah , except the word is Johnny 's leaving town without doing the job . Johnny wouldn 't cross me . It 's the girl . [ intense music ] I warned him about that dame . When 's Mark going to get here with the food ? Clark , and he 's always late . Any idea when something might happen ? Ghost-wise ? Well , yeah , that 's why you guys are here . Well , gee , I don 't know , this is our first job . [ intense music ] [ gunshot ] [ firing continues ] All I did was touch the wall and it tried to kill me . No , no . It was aiming at the wall . Everyone wait here . [ intense music ] It was the spirit , struggling to stay in this world . Unwilling to leave till it got whatever it wanted or needed . It created a gap between the two planes and that 's where the energy came from that caused those disturbances we saw . I don 't know about that I do know we 've got a 50 year old murder here . Dental records match those of a missing person . Who was it ? Johnny Carino . He played in a band in the ballroom . Musician , we found his clarinet . Question is , who killed him ? [ band music ] Johnny , Jeno wants to talk to you . Something 's wrong . I hear you don 't wanna work for me anymore . That 's not it , Jeno . Just that I 'm starting my life over again . ( Johnny ) I gotta gal who 's nuts about me . You understand . Sure , but why can 't you still work for me ? She don 't like this stuff . She wants me to be respectable . Could we have a little privacy ? She wants the kinda guy she could take home to her mom . You know ? Sure , I know . She makes you feel good , doesn 't she , Johnny ? Real good ? She 's gonna make you go to confession , ain 't she , Johnny ? - Cleanse your soul ? - It 's not like that . And then she wants you to make amends , won 't she , Johnny ? Maybe go to the police . [ intense music ] Listen , Jeno .. ... you and me go back a long time . I 'd never rat on you . We 're like family . I guess , the only way I 'll know is if you help me tonight . I can 't . I 'm sorry . [ intense music ] Don 't walk out on me , kid . It 's me or her . I promised her . [ music continues ] [ drum music ] [ melancholic music ] That 's the problem with promises . Some get broke . [ gasping ] Lisa . ( Clark ) Everybody thought he disappeared but he was really dead and buried in the wall . Yeah , but if the workers hadn 't started poking around Johnny Carino never would 've come back . What makes two young people like you mention the name Johnny Carino ? You knew him ? Everybody knew Johnny . He played at Trocadel , then he disappeared . Oh , he didn 't disappear , he was murdered . Oh , so that 's what happened . That poor woman . Is someone there ? Johnny . Oh , it 's you , Ernie . Ms. Lisa , is that you ? What 'chu doin ' here , this time of morning ' ? I-I 'm waiting for Johnny . He was supposed to meet me here last night . We 're gonna be married . Jeno told me he left , but I know he wouldn 't leave without me . And Johnny 's a straight up guy . He 'll be here . Why don 't you go on home ? I 'll get you when he comes . [ melancholic music ] 625 , East 46 Street . Number 201 . - Don 't forget , okay , Ernie ? - I-I won 't . ( Ernie ) So , I told her not to worry . I was sure he 'd show up . [ jazz music ] ( Lana ) Whatever became of her . ( Ernie ) For a long time she 'd come around .. ... waiting on him . Even after the government bought the place . Haven 't heard from her in years , though . [ phone ringing ] Where 're you goin ' ? All traces of paranormal activity left , but the skeleton . Our work is done . But what has Johnny gotten outta it ? What d 'you mean ? You said the spirit came back for a reason . I assure you , I sense no further presence . The sprits are at rest . Lana , where 're you going ? ( Clark ) We 've got straightening up to do . First , I have to straighten up the past . [ melancholic music ] [ computer beeping ] Quick , everybody get out . - What 's going on here ? - Please , Mr. Jackson , just- - [ door closes ] [ indistinct chatter ] What is goin on ? [ chattering continues ] [ beeping continues ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ intense music ] Everybody , leave the room . [ indistinct chatter ] [ intense music ] [ music continues ] No , it 's not safe . Johnny . Lisa . [ intense music ] I thought you 'd left without me . I told you I 'd wait . Forever , if you had to . And when you 're ready , I 'll still be waiting . [ melancholic music ] He-he just wanted me to know th-that he waited . I 'll wait forever if I have to , I promise . [ instrumental music ] [ theme music ]

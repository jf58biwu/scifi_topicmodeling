Don 't be so hard on them , tropek . They 're only children . - and this is a business . - I know , but it 's hard for them to be stuck back there with nothing to do ! [ Speaking foreign language ] - drop it , Maya . Oh , uh , if there 's anything you need , sir , please feel free to ask . The , uh , archimes are especially good today , sir . - I 'm looking for something fresh . - Oh , they 're all as fresh as a green snowflake . - These look diseased . - Oh , no , sir .

Maya , go call the police . - You know what I think about xyrites trying to infect the whole of altor by Peddling rotten fruit ? - No , please ! - There . - No ! - I just saved a dozen lives . - and I just saved two more ! - Hey- - Get out of here !

We know- - We 're sorry . - Mrs. Tropek , can you give us a description of any of the attackers ? - Gone- - All gone . - Come on- - One drink won 't hurt , will it ? - I gotta get home . - What 's the hurry ? Doesn 't your husband ever get home late ? - in the first place , Dr. Eastman , my children won 't be home late . And in the second place , you 're a worm . - Yeah , but a really nice worm . Come on , just one drink . - I 'll think about it . Hmm- - Nah . - Paging Dr. Eastman . Paging dr . Eastman . - Mrs. Tropek ? Mrs. Tropek , please- - We need your help . - We need to catch these people . - What time is it ? - Uh , no- - No . It 's-It 's all right , mrs . Tropek . - I have to make dinner ! - It 's okay- - It 's okay . - No- - You don 't understand ! - Nurse- - nurse ! - Calm down- - Calm down- - It 's all right . - You don 't understand ! - Calm down- - Calm down . - My family doesn 't know where I am- - They 'll be worried . - Everything will be fine . - Please- - I have to go home . - Calm down . - Oh , my family needs me ! - Can I get a doctor here ? Look , is there any chance of getting any attention ? Hello ? Is anybody at home ? - After all these years , you still smell like gardenias . How ya doin ' , Erika ? - Why , Patrick Brogan ! You old honey bunch , you ! Mmm . - Mmm . - Come on- - the drinks are on me . We gotta catch up on the last 20 years ! - Uh . - Hey- - Hey ! Nurse , what 's the chance of getting my clothes back ? I gotta get outta here ! - The doctor thinks you should remain here for observation , ma 'am . You 've had a minor concussion . - Well , give me two aspirin . And hand on heaven , you know , I 'm as good as new . Do I look sick to you , doll ? - Wait a minute- - Wait a minute . You 're not the unidentified woman with mild Concussion they brought in with mrs . Tropek ? What the hell you doing at a race riot ? You 're not some mindless bigot . - I was shopping . - Coincidence ? - Exactly , just my luck . - Right- - You 're trying to tell me a woman in your profession- - - Oh , you 've heard about that , huh ? - Uh-Huh- - Yeah . Just happens to be on altor and just happens to be at the location of a major incident . Erika , you better come clean with me . - Well , it wouldn 't be the first time . Remember my big claw foot bathtub ? - I 'm not playing games here , Erika . Talk to me . - Why- - What you gonna do ? Take me down to the station house and beat it out of me ? - Whatever it takes . - Penny for your thoughts . Altor to Jack . - Do you know who that it is in there with Brogan and podly ? - Mother abbess of demeter convent ? - Close . It 's Erika Brandt , famous bounty Hunter . - Oh , that would 've been my second guess . - Do you know that Brogan knew her back at nypd and never told me ? I know all about her- - Read about her in " guns and lasers . " This woman is amazing . - What was she , mercenary of the month ? - You know , you just don 't appreciate fine literature . - Name 's Burl flak . He 's wanted on Planet Danae for a series of hate crimes , including murder . He jumped bail . - So , if you can find him and return him before his bail is forfeit , you collect ten percent ? - Twenty . - Hey ! - It 's the free enterprise system- - Ain 't it just great ? - So , um , you think flak was involved in the attack on the xyrite store . - Oh , well , I don 't know for sure , Brogan . I mean , the truth is I 'm not even sure that flak 's really on altor . I 'm just following up a tip from an informant . So , if you 'll excuse me , boys , I have work to do . - Miss Brandt ! You may earn more than the police , but you are subject to the laws of altor . If flak has committed a crime here in demeter city , he belongs to us first . - Why , of course he does , captain , if you can catch him first . - Now , you listen to me . If you so much as litter or spit on the light walk- - - No need to worry , cap . Pure as the driven sludge , that 's me . You just ask my old friend , Patrick Brogan . Well , it 's been just this side of Paradise . - Now , listen , Brogan . The last thing we need in demeter city , right now , is a racist like flak . If he 's on the planet , I want him ! Just you make sure you get to him before she does , huh ? - Miss Brandt . - Well , hello , handsome . - I was wondering , since you 're new in town , maybe sometime you 'd like to get a bite to eat or something . You know , I 'd love to hear all about your old experiences . - I think you 'd be more interested in New experiences . Maybe I 'll give you a call sometime . - hell of a woman . - I believe , on your scale , she would rate at least a nine , Officer haldane . - Wrong , slomo . - that 's an 11 . - Ah , we spent all day on the planet . Four hours of trudging through green sludge . Then , we got called down to the fire bombing- - a family of xyronites . It was really awful . - Yeah , I saw that on the news . - Yeah . - Tough day , huh ? - Yeah . - hmm . So , anything else happen ? - No , not that I can think of . - So , that wasn 't you I saw kissing Erika Brandt in the hospital ? - I just ran into her . - I saw . - You just ran into her right on the lips . - Honey , she surprised me . - Oh , come on- - You don 't really think- - - What- - just because you used to lust after that man-Eater- - - Honey , I went out with her a few times . - with the morals of an alley cat . - It 's ancient history- - Honey , I hardly knew you then . - Why should I care- - I don 't care . - Good . - hmm . - Dr. Chan , just answer the questions . - Dr. Chan , five years ago , the health department revoked your license to practice medicine . How do you earn a living now ? - I retained some savings from better years . - You never practice medicine ? - Certainly not . That would be illegal . - But you practice your , uh , political interests ? - What are you implying ? - Aw , get off it , doc ! We read your files- - It 's right here ! You know what it says ? " Dr. Taiko Chan , rabid anti-Xyronite . " Well ? - Those parasites brought xyron fever onto this planet . Once upon a time , I had two dear , lovely children until the xyronites came . - We know about your children- - We understand your grief . - You could not begin to understand my grief ! - Huh . - My whole life has fallen apart- - my home , my practice . The xyronites destroyed it all . - So , it made you a drunk , too ? - Doc , uh , yesterday , by any chance , did you treat anybody for Blunt object injuries ? - As you pointed out , I have lost my license . - Answer the question . - I told you before- - I know nothing about such matters . - What about the location of Burl flak ? What do you know about that ? - Uh , lieutenant , I got an urgent message for Dr. Chan . Your wife 's called five times . She 's starting to get frantic . - Oh , dear . Oh , um- - - How does she know you were here ? - Oh , uh , occasionally , I , uh , lose my bearings . She has seen fit to , uh , furnish me with a-a-a locator . I 'm , uh , embarrassed to admit it has proven my savior on , uh , several occasions . Now , uh , either arrest me or , uh , set me free . Either way , I demand to speak to- - - You 're free to go . - Oh . - Xyrites , go home . - that 's right . - Hey . Check this out , huh ? Let 's get him . Hey- - What do you think you 're doing ? - What 's it look like I 'm doin ' ? - Xyrite scum ! We have as much right to be here as you ! - Hey- - You okay ? - Yeah- - Come on . Let 's get him ! Hey , come back here , you ! Ah ! - There he is ! - All right . - Let go of me , stinkin ' xyrites ! Ah ! - Come here . - Ah . - don 't- - Stop . Come on- - Come on . - Come on , scum ! - Well , boys , in about three minutes , there 's gonna be two less stinkin disease-Carrying vermin to worry about . Go get ' em . - Let 's get ' em ! Hey , you scum ! - Ah ! - How do you like it now , huh ? Hey , get the other one ! - Yeah ! How do you like that , scum ? - No ! - Xyrite ! - You have it ? - Of course . Two thousand credits . - You said 800 . - Supply and demand . This may not be the only cryo gun on the planet , but I doubt if you 'll find another . Cops are not too crazy about these things . Uh , of course , we might work out a payment in kind . - don 't take this personally , but I 'd rather freeze my eyeballs . Now , listen , doll . I may only get one chance with this thing , so how do I know if it 's even gonna work ? - Why don 't we ... try it out ? - Well , I 'd say that that 'd put our little agreement on ice , wouldn 't you ? - First , you stun your target . Sorry , Coney . Then , you freeze it . - Well , Coney ... why , you 're just an old softy , aren 't you ? - Five xyronite deaths in two days ! The whole damn city is ready to explode ! I won 't stand for it ! - Captain , we know that flak was involved with the killings . - Uh , he 's down there someplace . We just can 't locate him . - So , what are you doing here ? Waiting for him to turn himself in ? - No , sir . - Well , find him , damn it , before he kills , again ! - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . - Hey , we just got the file on Flak form Danae P.D. - Did you say Erika Brandt will get 20 % of the bail , if she finds him ? - Yeah , that 's right . - Well , the bail is three million credits . - So , she walks away with 600 grand . - I guess you 'll have to stop calling her a cheap tramp . - Envy is such an ugly emotion . - there 's something else you should know about flak . The bail forfeits in 12 days . - So ? - So , the jump to Danae takes two full weeks . - that doesn 't make sense . How is she gonna get him back in time to collect her money ? - Brogan , call for you on comm six , a mrs . Chan . - Brogan . - Lieutenant , you don 't know me , but you spoke with my husband yesterday , dr . Taiko Chan . - that 's right- - Uh , how can I help ? - I 'm worried about my husband . The thing is , I saw that xyronite woman on tv . She lost her children , too . - You think your husband was involved in that attack , mrs . Chan ? - No ! But the people he 's involved with , they 're the killers . You have to stop them , Mr. Brogan . You have to stop Burl flak . - Hi , fella- - Go on inside . Hey , you gonna zap Some xyrites tonight ? Yeah , lady , go on in- - go on . The meeting 's right inside . - Where is everybody ? - They 'll be here , flak . - Who 's she ? - No idea . But if she knows the location , she must be all right . - Oh , she 's more than all right . I don 't believe we 've met- - I 'm Burl flak . - Oh , I know . - You are a very attractive woman . - Veronica Wilson . - Veronica , you 're interested in our cause ? - Well , I was a landscape architect , and a good one , too , before the damn xyronites came and stole my job . - a normal person can 't live on the wages those animals will take . That 's why we have to exterminate them like the vermin that they are . - Oh , it 's so good to find some kindred spirits . - Flak , uh- - - Be right there . Excuse me . Perhaps we might discuss this , in more depth , after the meeting . - Oh , I 'd like that , in more depth . - Lieutenant , we 're in position . We have the back covered . - It 's as quiet as a grave back here . You sure mrs . Chan ain 't just trying to set us up ? - No , I don 't think so . Looks pretty real out here- - they got a lookout . - What 's the plan ? - Leave it to haldane . - Yeah , we 've heard that one before . - right . [ mumbling ] - Excuse me , Buddy . Could you spare a couple of credits for some coffee ? - No . Hey , get away from me , man . Get off me , firmer head ! Look , I told ya- - Leave ! - Serves you right . - Brogan , hurry up . Bring my boots- - My feet are freezing ' ! - oh ! They say they 've got xyron fever under control ! That the new quarantine screening process has eliminated the danger ! - No way ! - Well , I have here in my hand Positive proof that over 500 altorians have died of xyron fever in the past year , and your government is covering up the fact ! - Yeah ! - Great speaker , huh ? - It 's all a conspiracy to force this low paid , sub matter , sub species into the workforce to drive down honest wages . - Yeah ! - Just like it was on planet Danae . - Yeah ! - Scum ! - You know , I heard a familiar and heartbreaking story , just before we started this meeting , of a woman thrown out of work , driven to the point of desperation by This scourge ! I 'd like her to come up here and share it with you . - Yeah . - Yeah . - Veronica ? - Come on , Veronica . - Come on- - Come on- - Tell us . - No , really- - I- - No . I couldn 't do that- - No . - Come on , everybody- - Let 's get her up here ! - Get on up here . - Yeah ! - Well , I- - - Police- - Everybody , stay where you are and put your hands where I can see them ! - Stop , right there ! Move any closer , and I kill her ! Now , put your weapons down ! - No . - Do it ! - Your move . - Sandoff- - Barko- - Let 's go ! - Flak , run ! - Look out ! - Ugh ! - Oh ! - Oh , damn you guys ! Fifteen minutes more , and I would 've had him ! - Come on , Brogan . - Police- - Freeze ! - Oh , great timing . - Flak , here- - Come on ! - Hey , fredo , this is urgent . - All units , two-Eight-O point One bc in progress . It 's a light blue mpv fumes mark four . - can 't you go any faster ? - I 'm tryin ' - - I 'm tryin ' ! - take it . - got it . - Catch that damn thing . - Hang on . Tracking . - Oh , jeez , look at the snow . I told you we should 've left your mother 's earlier . - George . - You 're gonna need a doctor . - You don 't get a move on- - We 're gonna need an undertaker . Ooh ! What was that ? - Nothin ' . - We should be right on him . - Yeah , there he is . Flak , reduce your speed and descend to ground level , or we 'll have to use force . Lock and load the cannons . - You got it . - Come on . - What do we do ? - Keep goin ' . - Damn snow blades don 't work . Should 've installed blowers years ago . - hmm . - Ah- - Whoa- - What 's that ? - Look out ! - Ah ! - Hang on . - This is our chance . Go- - Go- - go ! - Damn- - He 's getting away . - Oh , forget it- - We got another problem over here . - Hang on- - George ! Ah ! - George- - George , are you all right ? - We 've got an emergency situation , zone ten , south krusuki boulevard . We 're gonna need paramedics . - What about flak ? - We 'll get him the next time . - Yeah , that 's right . - Okay , let 's go . Come on- - We 're gonna be late . - Erika ? - May I come in ? - Um , yeah . - Hello , Patrick . I 'm sorry that flak got away last night . - Oh , no , it 's okay . Um , can I get you somethin ' to drink ? I was just having a glass of milk . - Milk ? Oh , Pat , it has been a long time . - Erika , I got a lot of work to do . So , if you 're just here to- - - Okay , I 'm sorry- - I 'm sorry . I just came to ask you something- - Something serious . That kiss in the hospital , did it bring back any memories ? - We had a great time together , but that was 20 years ago . - So , your marriage is- is the luckiest thing that ever happened to me . Now , let me ask you a question . Flak 's bail forfeits in 11 days . It takes two full weeks to get back to Danae . You 're too late to collect the bounty . - that 's my worry , and-and that 's the real reason that I 'm here . I need your help , Pat . And maybe I could help you , too , for , uh , old time 's sake . - I 'm listening . - suppose I could still collect it . How would you like half ? - What are you talkin ' about ? - Team up with me- - Help me find flak . With your contacts and my contacts , I mean , what difference does it make if flak gets punished on Danae or on altor ? What are you doing ? - Inviting you out of my house ! - Oh , for once in your life , Brogan , will you do something smart ? - Either you leave , or I have you arrested for attempted bribery of a police officer . - You never change , do you , Brogan ? You always were a boy scout , honest and stupid . You know , that 's the real reason we broke up , because I was too smart for you ! You felt threatened ! - No , Erika- - the reason we broke up is because I knew I could never make a life with Somebody Whose value System was as screwed up as yours . Goodbye ! - Enjoy your milk . - Move . - What 's he doin ' here- - I told you . My arm is fine . - It is not fine . Take a look , doc . - When did this happen ? - Last night . - You should 've called . - Couldn 't take any chances , doc , when someone 's been yapping ' to the cops . - I told them nothing , sir . - Whatever you say . Do your stuff . - Uh , do you have pain ? - It hurts like hell . - Oh , it 's become infected . Hold still , sir . - Damn , Chan . Your hand 's shakin ' like a frightened xyrite . - I , uh , I need a drink . Just one , please ? - Go get it for him . - No- - Uh , let me go . You help Mr. Flak onto the bed . Hmm ? - Okay . - Ah . - He knows too much . Take care of it . - Sure . - The part where he gets out of the car . I liked it , too- - You know , that was good- - It was good . - It was so cool . - Hey , how 's it goin ' ? - Hey , great- - How was , uh , " Light motion " ? - Bright . - Fast . - Didn 't they used to make those things with less violence ? - Oh , dad , you should 've seen it . This guy 's head comes right off . It was awesome ! - Gruesome . - Matt , isn 't it time for cyber cowboys ? - It is- - What are we waiting for ? - Something wrong ? - I smell perfume , gardenias . - I was gonna tell ya . - She was here , in my house ? - She just showed up . She wanted-She wanted me to work with her . - I just bet she did . So , when were you gonna tell me about this ? - Sally , you just walked in the door . Honey , it 's not as if anything happened . - Oh- - So , if something had happened , you would 've told me . But since nothing happened , you didn 't wanna tell me ? - Right- - No- - That 's not what I meant . - Yeah- - Well , what do you mean ? - What I meant was , since there was nothing to tell you , as soon as the kids were in bed , I would 've gotten around to telling you that there was nothing- - This is stupid . I don 't even know what we 're arguing about . Oh , and by the way , some doctor named Eastman called you while you were gone . - Oh . - Yeah , " Oh . " So , who is he- - said He 'd heard all about me . - Uh , I work with him at the hospital . He 's-He 's new- - He 's a really nice guy . I think I promised to go out for a drink with him one night . I think that 's probably why he called . - You- - - So , Erika Brandt , she 's a gorgeous woman , as far as older woman go . - So ? - You dated her before you met Sally , right ? - No- - I quit dating her when I met Sally . - Well , don 't get me wrong . I really like Sally . - So do I. - Yeah , she 's great . But Erika- - - You got a question ? Let 's hear it . - Okay . Why ? Why Sally over Erika ? - Because you don 't marry the person you wanna live with . You marry the person you can 't live without . - Hey , Captain says drop whatever you 're doing and report to his office immediately . - Yes , sir . - With or without ? You gotta decide . Captain , you want- - - You know mrs . Chan ? - Mrs. Chan ... what 's wrong ? - My husband . - Somebody showed up at the Chan house last night . Took the doctor away . He hasn 't come back . - I sewed these buttons . They 're locators on his- - - Yes , ma 'am , we know about the locators . - I found him . - She found him ? - She traced the coordinates . Found him here , right in the middle of demeter bay . - Oh , my god- - TAIKO ! No ! No . - Police- - Freeze ! - Check in there . He 's stunned . - Do you smell anything ? - Oh , damn it- - gardenias ! I can 't believe she beat us to him . - What the hell is this ? - Bring that thing . - Where we goin ' ? - Cargo bay ! - Oh , of course- - I knew that . - How do you find a needle in a haystack ? - Storage facilities for incoming earth vehicles will be transferred to loading dock " C " due to construction . - See- - I told ya . Nothing going to Danae for 36 hours . - Yeah- - Well , I don 't care . She 's here- - I know she is . Why don 't you try down there ? [ Indistinct ] repeat . [ indistinct ] - Well , what a surprise . - Well , hello , handsome . Are you looking for me ? - Where 's flak ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about . I just came here to pick up some clothes . I had them shipped from earth . I like it here so much on altor . I 've decided to extend my stay . - It 's not gonna fly- - We got the cryo gun . We got flak 's bodyguard . - But you don 't have flak , do you ? He just keeps on Slipping through your fingers . - Look , lady , I know that you 've got flak . And frankly , I don 't care if he 's punished here or on Danae . Actually , Danae is better . - Well , you 're a lot smarter than your partner . - why don 't you make me the same offer that you made him then ? - Oh , he told you about that , huh ? - Like you said , we 're partners . Have to admit , though , you 're much better looking . - So , are you saying that you 'd be interested in forming a new partnership ? - Maybe . Not just on flak . On everything . - You think you can keep up with me ? - You want references ? - No . Just a blood test . Come here . - Nice try . But you really should be listening to what I 'm saying . You 're much better off , if you take my deal . If I take you in , we 're gonna ground and search every freighter in This terminal till we find flak . Now , where does that leave you ? - Okay , doll , you got a deal . - Fifty-Fifty , starting with flak . - Do we shake ... or kiss , partner ? - Not so fast . First , you show me flak . I 'm not throwing away my career till I know that you got him in the bag . Now , we 're even . You feel better ? Can we get outta here before Brogan finds us ? - In here . - This freighter isn 't going to Danae . - No- - But for the right sum of money , exouner was willing to program a short , uh , detour . Here he is . - It 's cute . But how do I know he 's in there ? - Open it and then you 'll see . - Very cool , Erika . - So , handsome , we have a deal ? - No . We have a problem . You see , I don 't care if flak gets nailed on altor or not . But , well , captain podly , he was pretty insistent . - forget it . You don 't have a weapon , remember ? - Neither do you . - Wrong . First rule of bounty hunting , be prepared . Oh , it 's too bad , ' cause I was looking forward to exploring a-a pretty torrid partnership with you . - that 's okay , Erika . You still can , after we turn over flak . - Brogan- - What the- - How ? - Locator . Got the idea off a dead man . - Two boy scouts ! So , how 's a girl like me supposed to make a living ? - Possession of an illegal weapon . Use of an illegal weapon , causing endangerment of life . Attempted bribery- - Resisting arrest . Oh-Oh , miss Brandt , I suspect you could grow old and gray on the rock . - Listen , captain . We 're on the same side here . I was just trying to ma- - - Ah , quiet ! I know what you were just . However , in light of the fact that flak is all right and that he and his friends are fit to stand trial , I am inclined- - - Oh , cap , you 're an absolute sweetie ! - I told you to be quiet . I am inclined to let you go , provided that you promise never to come back to altor ever again . - I never liked it here anyway- - It 's too dry . Bad for my complexion . Word of honor , I 'll be gone tonight . Cross my heart . So long . - New issue of " guns and lasers ? " - Actually , no . Even better , stands for " Widows against racism . " When the authorities on Danae heard that we captured flak , they decided to donate half of his bail to Maya tropek . - The xyronite lady who lost her family . - Yeah , right . And now , she and Dr. Chan 's widow are gonna use the money and start an anti-Racism foundation . - Maybe there 's hope for the galaxy yet . - Officer Castle would be an 11 . Am I right , Officer haldane ? - No . Wrong again , slomo . She 's a 20 . - Uh-Oh . I 'll get it . Erika , what are you doin ' here ? - You didn 't think I 'd leave altor without saying " Good-Bye , " did you ? Hi ! You must be Pat 's wife . I 'm Erika Brandt . - Yes . - Never thought you 'd go for the high-Strung type , Brogan . - Erika , look . - No , really-Really , I 'd love to stay , but I can 't , really . I 'm on a line at the simter in an hour . I got this currency smuggler , and if I can grab him , I can make a quick 80 grand . So , I guess this is it . Last call . - No- - Mmm . - Bye , Brogan . My loss . You got a hot one here , lady . Take good care of him . - Sally , that wasn 't my fault . - I know . - Can we just stop this ? - She 's gone forever . You never have to see her or hear about her , again . - Do you remember that Dr. Eastman I told you about ? I just called him , and I agreed to meet him for that drink . I mean , it 's long past due . May as well get the darn thing over with . So , may be late . Don 't wait up . - Sally , don 't do this ! - Dad ! - Gotcha , didn 't I ? - Come here , you .

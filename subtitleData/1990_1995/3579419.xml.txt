 Written and Directed by Sake Kawamura The Last Frankenstein People of today will live longer than any other generation than before But they will find more to be unhappy about - Akira Aleo Whilst the ideas are still fresh Whilst they are still haunting my tormented soul I want to take courage and transcribe them . I swear , everything is true . Even now , after living through the worst of it , I 'm afraid And maybe none of us will ever be the same again That is precisely the reason I must remember every detail If something can 't be proven through research Then it 's not worth knowing As a science professor , I believed that . Perhaps that ... explains why I was ambivalent to the early warnings . The suicides . Religion of Death Death Religion . A. God of Death Death ... Death ... Death ... Death ... Death ... Death ... The greatest thing you can do is die We are all born for that purpose . Everyone of us lives to die . This simple message is the foundation of the Shinyo-Kiyo . To fulfill our destiny we must praise God and kill ourselves . Don 't give away your right to death . Don 't allow someone else to perform your gift to your soul . Embrace your death as you have embraced your life . Shino-kiyo is our destiny ... Is the end near ? Yes . It 's true . We are members of the last generation ... We are the last people . Last people ? All praise the God of Death ... the God of self-exterminaion . All praise life through eternal death . Shiyo-kiyo . Death ... Death .. Death ... Behind me is another religious rally from a Suicide cult . Shino-kiyo is being called the " New Theology " It 's popularity is born from the current epidemic of suicides . Reverand Ipei Tokuda teaches the philosophy of " rightful suicide " Meanwhile the suicide rate in Tokyo has tripled in the last 6 months . Let 's see what some of the spectators have to say . Excuse me ... could we talk with you for a minute ? What do you think about suicides ? It seems popular , but I don 't want to try it . Sir ! Pardon me ... Do you have an opinion about the current rash of suicides ? I 'm in a hurry ... Very quickly , sir . How do you feel about suicide ? What ? How do you feel about suicide ? What do you think ? It doesn 't seem to be the act of a rational people , does it ? What do you think about the current rash of suicides ? I don 't think it is a good thing . I mean , when somebody kills themself , somebody else is sad . Excuse me ... we 'd like to talk to you a minute . I want to get your opinion on the suicide hysteria . I don 't want to be on TV . We just want your opinion . What do you think about suicide ? I think people should do what they want . Even kill themselves ? Mmmm . I don 't know ask someone else . He 's so beautiful . So independent . That 's why it 's beautiful . He looks so peaceful . Your death is the most personal thing you will ever do It should be a selfish , but satisfying act . From the moment we 're born we begin to die . Planned suicide is the essence of life . B. Human Body The human body is considered both strange and mysterious Perhaps , it is the most mysterious thing in the world . I 'm referring specifically to " how " and " why " of humanity . However many conclusions are supplied by today 's scientists . In fact , we can practically say , we know most everything about the human body . Excuse me professer , but I still think the body is mysterious . And ... why do you think that ? Even though we may understand much about the human body ... We still don 't understand everything about human beings . We are not concerned with behavioral philosophies . I believe there is a direct correlation between behavorial science and physical science . The human body is in constant evolutionary flux . So you believe humans are still evolving ? I 'm referring more to change then evolution . I think our style of living dictates to the human body I think we are influenced by enviroment and social fads . Do you have an opinion on this , professor ? First the topic is to broad ... Do you think the structure of the body " changes " based on fad ? Yes , I do believe it ... I think cultural pressures can shape and change the human body . Professer , in the popular view of evolution which came first ? Change or the reason for change ? Here ... this is a human body ... This is our concern . You are too involved in intellectual jargon . You need to be more concerned about the lower body . Don 't misunderstand . I 'm not suggesting that you have sex with me . So you are real ... You were ... . making fun of me . No I wasn 't . Then why didn 't you answer my question seriously ? You were talking about the evolution change question ? Even though we know a lot about the human body ... The suicide rate is going sky high . The scientists are doing nothing about it Truthfully , I don 't understand the situation either . We should leave soon . Can we go some place and spend the night together ? I 'm sorry . I can 't . You always say no . My daughter is waiting . You mean your wife ? Not daughter . My daughter . Your not a very good liar . You mean wife and daughter . My wife commited suicide 5 years ago . Death ! Death ! Suicide is God ! C. Mai Welcome home , Father . Stop . Don 't waste your power on playthings . Did you eat diner ? No . I made some rice curry . I 'll have some . Mai . I told you to stop . Goodnight . Father ... What ? Do you love me ? I love you . I 'm calling you . D. Dead Body What happened ? The research cadaver was stolen . Stolen ? This is the fifth time since , the school year started . What kind of fruitcake would do it ? Ah ... Here is Sarusawa . - He 's young but bright. - Hello . You 're late . I 'm sorry . We already started the meeting . Please continue . This conversation is meaningless ... Why are we even talking about suicide ? Why do we care ? It 's officially considered a disease now . That 's ridiculous ! Suicide isn 't an infectious disease . I ... disagree ... with ... that ... opinion . illness ... is ... a ... misunderstood ... concept . That 's insignificant . But ... it 's difficult to understand the sudden interest . We are not Theologists . Maybe we should ask Ipei Tokuda for help ? That 's not funny . While talking so carelessly , ... people are killing themselves . Someone from this university may die soon . I wonder if it 's really a communicable disease ? Our job is precisely to find the answer to that . It 's definately a disease ... a transmitted illness . Often , when someone dies , others in the family commit suicide too . So you think this a new killer disease ? That is just bullshit ! It 's definately a transmitted disease . But .. is it really caused by mental disorders ? No ... This disease attacks and disables a section of the brain . Disables the brain ? ! Have you conducted research ? We are doing it now . But it appears to be a disease . This is a scientific problem . From our research ... we discovered an incubation period of 3 to 5 years . Three to five years ? Yes . This means a carrier could infect thousands of people . We could all be at risk . It 's probable I may already be infected by this disease . Don 't bring personal problems to this meeting . I 'm sorry . Are you sure about this " brain infection " ? Yes . Can you give us more details ? I need more research before I care to do that . You 're ... avoiding ... the ... question . No ... We have a special scientist conducting this research . Who is that ? Professor Aleo . You said Aleo ? Is ... he .. still ... alive ... ? Who is he ? You don 't know him ? You don 't need to know him ! Professor Frankenstein . Profesor Oyamu , you 're saying ... . only Aleo can solve this problem ? Well ... I 'm saying he 's already done much research . Seems like we 're back at the beginning again ! Aleo is a freak ! What can he offer us ! ? I support you . What are you men doing ? ! Even if he 's alive , it 's the same as if he were dead . Motoyama ... The human race .. will be destroyed if the suicides continue . What do you know about Professor Aleo ? Don 't ask . The more you know . The less you 'll want to know . Tell me anyway . Aleo is a true genius . Because of his brillant mind He became involved in unconventional research and he was booted out of the scientific community . No one mentions his name or his research . What kind of research ? Evolution . Evolution of ... ? He was trying to create an advanced human being . He believed he could create a human ... unmotivated by emotions . Maybe , somehow , he knew of the pending suicide threat . Regardless , he gave up on humans long ago ... long before I did . Humans are very weak and influenced by any quack ... They embrace any new fad and make it part of their life . Everybody is holding their life on a slender thread . Suicide is actually becoming garishly attractive . Can I borrow this book ? I 'll give it to you but ... It 's OK take it . Listen , Sarusawa . If you 're planning to work with Aleo . It won 't be easy . Be careful . I don 't mind . I believe I 'm already infected by the virus . Why do you think that ? What are the symptoms ? Do you know ? I don 't think you 're going to die . Why ? Just my intuition . Goodbye . Professor ... Goodbye : I 'm sorry . Goodbye . I 'm sorry . Phylogeny of the Human By Akira Aleo Today society is suffering from a mysterious illness . This is a period of transmitted disease similar to the Balck Plague . Soon , the grey spector of death will visit even the shadowland . Humans will destroy themselves and a new species will arise . We ... must deny human emotions and frail sensitivities . We need a new strength which will seperate us from humanity . E. Goodbye and Hello Goodbye and sorry . F. Psychic Link That is a human . Look at the changes made through nuclear power . I know you 're aware ... of what I 'm talking about . But we as a society , are unaware of the dangers involved . Sometimes I daydream about the problems Anyway , lets return to the book . Attitudes of men and women are merging ... Both sexes are beginning to look and act the same . They are merging into the same type of creature ... I knew death before I was born . Death is always comfortable and honest . It 's not the place you might think it is . I 've seen it ! Death is like an Oasis . Yes you heard me . Like an Oasis . Before I die I know what death is . Mai ... She 's been like this for three hours . Mai girl ... Mai . When did your wife commit suicide ? Five years ago . Did your daughter develop her psychosis after her mothers death ? Yes . This time its more serious . what do you mean doctor ? She has lost her ability to communicate . What do you mean ? Her brain is working but she has forgotten how to use it . I don 't understand much about teenagers ... anymore . Did you hear about the group suicide today ? Huh ? Oh you didn 't hear ? High school kids commited suicide at Yoyogi Park . High school kids killing themselves ? Do you think it has to do with the rash of suicides ? We 're trying to figure it out . I don 't understand anymore . Let me ask you on a professional level Do you believe in psychic powers ? Do you ? Tell me . For me , I have no choice . Mai 's been using psychic power for along time now . Mai . G. Beyond Human Species Stop Haruo ! You must learn to be polite . Are you Aleo ? I 've been waiting for you Professor Sarusawa . I have been waiting for you ... a very long time . And I knew you 'd come here someday ... But why ? Theres no hurry . All in due time ... Haruo ! Bring us tea . Real . You 're human . Who are you ? - What ? - Who are you ? No . Who are you ? She 's my wife . Her name is Kurara . Come down here . Go . Eat . This isn 't good . It 's to salty . By the way how is it ? What ? I 'm talking about the world . Is it still boring ? No . Too many things are happening now . That 's good news . A power plant exploded . a serious war in the Middle East . And the suicide disease is spreading . Humans are approaching the end . That sounds interesting . Do you think it 's funny ? Why do you want to be a hero ? I hate humans . To tell the truth I came to ask you for help . I thought you could save us from the suicide disease . Mmmm . This meat is pretty good . I don 't like meat . - Eat it. - I don 't like meat . I want rice soup . You 're being infantile ! You have no manners . Your parents should have beat you . You 're wife is a funny woman . Her body is too weak . She 's useless . Mmm . Like you said this meat is good . This is the first time I 've eaten such meat . Is that right ? ... It 's human meat . The skin of Japanese men who eat good meat . I was making a joke . Doctor Aleo ... I must ask the question . Exactly what is the suicide disease ? I 'm not intrested in the suicide disease anymore . Then why are you here in the mountains with the dead bodies ? I like dead bodies more then living ones . You are just like a dead person . True . Maybe I am already dead . I guess I was expecting too much of you . I see you thought I was a socially conscious scientist ? That lifestyle is nonsense ... Have humans ever really been helped by science ? Do you really believe scientists give a damn about people ? I 'm not that presumptuous . That 's good . I 'm not presumptuous . But I am disappointed in you . I 'm leaving . I knew about the suicide disease ten years ago . Come . Sarusawa , ... let 's stop the facade of hlping humans . The human race has already done everything it 's wanted to do . So anything we accomplish now ... is meaningless in scope . As long as humans exist , the spiral will continue downwards . But I 'm really tired of the depressing descent . That 's why I decided to develop an advanced human . My superman is someone who can stop the spiral . And this is the time I 've been waiting for . It 's time for the advent ... of the new human species . Do you believe in evolution ? Evolution ? I don 't know about that . Evolution , by defination , is the improving of a species . I 'm not sure the human race has the innate intelligence for it . Why do humans hate so much ? Because humans never tried to accept me or my ideas . You 're a sad person . Don 't evaluate me ... Evaluation is the lowest trait of the human race . Look at this ! This is the beginning of a new race . A superman ... And the superhuman 's bride . It 's the cadaver from my class . Your cadaver ? You say such conventional things ... She 's neither human nor dead . She 's my superman 's bride . Bride ? - Yes.- I 'm going to put life into these bodies . I will suceed ! Through my creation , the perfect superman will be born , ... a son from these two . A son ? These two will rival the reputation of Adam and Eve . Their sexual encounters will be legendary . You can watch the momentous performance . But how will you put life into these freaks ? Freaks ? That 's not a nice term . Don 't tell me you 're going to open the roof and ... the wind will roar and the lightening will strike . You read too many novels . I 'm not Frankenstein . No . You are Dr.Frankenstein. Don 't joke about this . We can put life into ... the supermen . I 've completed the surgery and wait on a special power . What do you mean by that ? I 'm talking about psychic power . Everything is prepared for rejuvination thru psychic power . That 's why I was researching people who possessed this power . The people who could help me create my superman . Oh , I see ! It 's Mai ! You wanted Mai ! According to my research no one has stronger powers then Mai . You didn 't want me , you wanted Mai . - No.- I didn 't say that . I 'm glad you 're her father . You understand what I hope to do . ... . I won 't need to use violence . Violence ? Don 't think about touching one hair on Mai 's head . Like I said , if we have an understanding there will be no trouble . This is terrible ! I came here to ask you to help save Mai . Finally , you tell the truth ... I knew you didn 't care about the disease or the human race . You 're just a concerned father . I don 't understand what is wrong with her . She seems fine . I want her to become a normal high school girl . A normal high school kid , like the ones commiting suicide ? Think about what you are saying ! I 'm going home . Sarusawa ! You can 't leave you know my secret . Sorry . It 's changed alot ... Definately , this world should be destroyed . Let 's go Haruo . Listen Mai , ... I 'm going to show two people to you . They are parteners . Do you understand ? They are your friends . They will make a new world with you . That 's why I want you to help revive them . She won 't do this ! Sarusawa ! If you are a true scientist , Observe quietly . Shut up ! I don 't want any part of you ! Let 's go , Mai . Mai ! Seems like she wants to do this with me ... Mai , let 's go . Active the neutron cells . Raise your hands . Walk ! Walk forward ! Turn . This is your man . This is your woman . You two are attractive . Kiss him . Kiss him ... Kiss him . Kiss him . Kiss him again . Have sex . Put your penis in her vagina . Kiss ! Sex ! Sex ! It 's impossible . He doesn 't understand love . That 's not true ... He doesn 't understand sex . We must teach him . Teaching love ? Not love . Just sex . Let 's go Mai . She doesn 't want to go with you . Why don 't you relax . This will interest you too . H. Teaching Kiss her . Kiss her . Kiss him . Not me ! Stupid ! It 's impossible . You 're not teaching them the right way . You must teach the feeling behind the act . Don 't tell me you 're talking about love ? That 's pedestrian . If they possess that kind of emotion they 'll be just like humans . But without it they won 't have a child . Let 's tell them something about love . Love lesson ? Love lesson . Help them sit . A father asked : what does that teacher do ? Nothing . That was my answer . I thought I told my mother and father ... a long time ago that my teacher was doing nothing . My father should have remembered it clearly . But he said : What does he do ? You respect him so much . And then he stopped asking the question . My father thinks ... if a person is useful or successful then he should be out in the working world . According to my father , only a Yakuza or a bum does no work . I 'm going to tell you the truth . Kurara isn 't really my wife . I created her . She was the first of my experiments . But I hate Kurara . She is a grave disappointment . She was the greatest disaster in my life . I feel this way because she is sterile . I forgot to activate her womb . She is a woman who can 't be a woman . Horrible . Awful . Horrible . I hope he hasn 't damaged anything . Mai . She seems to be feeling better . Communicating again . Mai ... Are you ... ? It 's not working . Nothing is happening . Thank you ... My thanks to humans who still care . The time has come for the destruction of the world . You are worried and concerned about your fate ... I know how you feel . I used to be human too . I lived in isolation for almost 100 years . Do you understand ? 100 years ... and during those 100 years , humans refused to change . That 's a grave mistake . Perhaps it 's the humans greatest fault . People are controlled by emotions ... Happiness , sadness , anger , lust ... they mold human behaviour . Humans are preoccupied with things that don 't exist ... They are influenced by dreams and illusion . Humans don 't realize how vulnerable they are . They 're too stupid to even understand that they are stupid . These are the reasons human beings . should be destroyed . My new race of supermen is the hope for the future ... The only hope . Allow me to present ... the humans of tomorrow , void of emotions . My superman ! You are a unique type of genius . Unique ? ... I think I understand myself very well . I don 't care to be judged by society 's standards . Did I show you my collection ? No . These are my best friends . My collection of abnormal fetuses . This fetus commited suicide ... She tied a knot in her imbecile cord . I rejoice in her decision ... I 'm comfortable knowing she ... will never move her little arms . When I was thinking about going , I made a decision . I decided to wait until the next day ... I made that decision on Saturday evening . But then that night ... Kei commited suicide . And suddenly , I no longer had any reason to go . Whenever I think of about that night , I always feel melancholoy . Kiss . Kiss . We were an unconventional spectacle . But to us , it seemed very normal . Mai understood Haruo 's grunts . And her illness seemed to pass . But only when she communicated with the monsters and Haruo . Suddenly I found myself holding Kei 's body in my arms . I wanted to see his face . When I pickd up his head and tried to look I was in an awkward position and I couldn 't see clearly . I dropped him to the ground ... It wasn 't because I was afraid but , because he was heavy , ... I didn 't feel like crying ... More correctly , ... I felt afraid . I wasn 't afraid of Kei 's dead body . I was afraid because suddenly I understood the delicacy of life . Death ... Death ... Death ... Goodbye . I 'm sorry . We both believe in the same God . Tokuda ! I no longer pray . Tokuda ! He 's dead ! Let 's begin the ceremony . I. Apocalypse Kiss . Kiss him . Kiss him . Kiss him . And have sex ! For all the people , for our world , for peace ... SEX ! SEX ! The game of love is over ! What do you want ? What ? You asshole ! You limpdick ... J. Catastrophe I decided to stay in the house with ... Haruo , the monster and Mai . It would be correct to say Dr.Aleo was destroyed . ... long before he began his studies . The doctor hated humans , but he died because of human emotions . The superman began acting more and more like a human . In fact he studied all he could about human behaviour . As the superman learned about human behaviour . He developed pride and emotions similar to the humans . Isn 't that the essence of evolution ? What is you name ? Name ? None . Where are you from ? Ocean . Why did you come ? To become human . Did you succeed ? So what are you ? Universe . Universe ? Child of the ... Universe . Your favorite food ? Curry rice . Favorite color ? I don 't see the colors . Who is your favorite author ? Nastume ... . ... Sousek . How do you spend your time ? Thinking . Thinking . I--Myself . K. Child Of The Universe When I arrived at the beach it was to late . The superman gave his body back to the ocean . I dedicate this chronicle ... To those people I knew who ... died from the suicide disease . during the proceedings , this people are , my wife , Professor Motoyama ... Dr. Akira Aleo , Kurara , the superman 's bride , ... the superman .

You got it ? Let 's go now ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Agent Mulder ! Krycek . What 's up ? There 's a situation going down . - They want you out there right away . - What kind of situation ? Hostage negotiation . - And they want me ? - Yeah . - What for ? - A guy escaped a mental institution . He 's got four people at gunpoint in an office . Claims he 's being controlled by aliens . Stay back behind the barrier ! Police ! Stay back ! - Krycek , Mulder , F.B.I. Where 's the command post ? - Right that way , sir . - Yes , sir ! - Okay , I got it right here in front of me . - Get him on the horn ! - Lucy . Come down these A.C. vents . You can put people on the third and fourth floor . - Agent Mulder ? - Yeah . Lucy Kazdin , negotiation commander . Thanks for coming . - This is Agent Krycek . - Let me show you what we 've got . His name 's Duane Barry . He 's armed with a nine-millimeter ... Smith and Wesson handgun , one nine-round magazine . It is our belief that he 's prepared to use the gun and not afraid to die . - What does he want ? - Safe passage for himself ... and his original hostage , a shrink named Hakkie . - Passage to where ? - He 's bent on taking ... the doctor with him to an alien abduction site . Only he can 't quite remember where the site is , so he stopped at a travel agency . - Is he lucid ? - Yes . But he 's off his medication , so he 's manic ... ranting about scoop marks , scars on his body , homing devices and a lot of other nonsense . - Like what ? - This alien abduction business , which I guess you know about . Yeah , yeah . But I 've never been in a hostage negotiation before . Oh , we 'll take you through it . Agent Rich is our advisory commander . He and I will be coaching you . What Mr. Barry needs right now is a friend , someone who appears to understand him and can appeal to his sense of reason . Do we know anything about his abduction experiences ? You really believe in this stuff , Agent Mulder ? Is that a problem ? We 're here to save lives . You 'll begin negotiations immediately . Every three hours , we 'll reevaluate your progress ... and let our tactical commander advise and update on the use of force . If this man is an abductee , I need to know more about him . His personal history . Each abduction case is different . That material has not been made available to us . And nobody 's thought to call the hospital for records ? Look , Agent Mulder . The guy is a psycho . Your object is to keep him on the phone . The longer you do , the more chance he 's not gonna kill anybody . We stop to do a Freudian analysis , next thing we know we 've got four dead hostages . So whatever crap you gotta make up about spacemen or UFOs , just keep him on the phone . Are we gonna have to sit on the floor like this all night ? I told you to shut up . We all have families , for God 's sake . Duane , don 't hurt anyone . - Please ? - I 'm not gonna hurt you , Doc . Because this time you 're going with Duane Barry ... so you can see what it 's like . That 's it 's real ! - Duane ? Yeah ? This is Special Agent Fox Mulder . - Look , I wanna try to help you . - Yeah ? Well ... We 're just sittin ' here waitin ' for , uh , travel plans . I think I know what You 're going through , Duane . I just wanna make sure You get what you want ... and that Bob , Kimberly , Gwen and Dr. Hakkie don 't get hurt . You know what I 'm goin ' through ? You think you know what Duane Barry 's goin ' through ? You don 't know jack ! I know You 're scared , Duane , and that you 'd like to see this all come out right . Yeah , right . So they can put me back in the nuthouse ... where I belong . We 're only concerned about your safety , Duane . You and the others . Hey , what 's your name ? Mul-der ? I know the routine : honesty , containment , conciliation . Am I missin ' somethin ' ? You need someone to trust , Duane . I know a lot of people who 've been through similar experiences . You wanna do something for me , Agent Mulder ? You keep your dogs on a leash . You try to gas me out or do anything stupid , these people die . They 're not takin ' me again . You gotit ? - They can take somebody else ! - Nobody 's gonna try anything , Duane . - Who is this guy ? - He 's F.B.I. , isn 't he ? - Former F.B.I. And you didn 't think to mention that . He 's been out of the Bureau since 1982 . Institutionalized on and off for over a decade . It 's beside the point . The point being that the Bureau wants to minimize its embarrassment , isn 't that it ? - That we can police our own ? - They would like it done as neatly as possible . - You 're off to a hell of a start . - Negotiation is a process . If you wanted somebody to read the script , you didn 't have to bring me . This method has proven extremely successful in winning the hostage taker 's trust . N-No . That man is afraid . And the only way you 're gonna win his trust is by trying ... to understand what he is afraid of . Have you ever spoken to an abductee , Agent Kazdin ? Heard them talk about having their brain sucked out through their nostril ... while being wide awake through the experience ? - Would you like to know what they do to a woman 's ovaries ? - Not particularly . Well , understand that you might have to alter your approach a little bit here . - Is there anything I can do ? - Yeah . - What 's your name again ? - Krycek . Krycek , have you got your notepad ? Grande , two percent cappuccino with vanilla . Agent Rich ? As you can see , Carl , the SWAT team ... - has taken positions on all the surrounding buildings . - Scully . - It 's me . I 'm in Virginia . Yeah , I know . I 've been watching it on TV . - What 's going on out there ? - What 's the media saying ? That an escaped mental patient is holding four people hostage in a travel agency . What they 're not telling you is that he 's former F.B.I. who also claims to be an alien abductee . - Seriously ? - Yeah . His name is Duane Barry . Look , Scully , I need your help . I need you to find out what happened to him . Anything ... transcripts from therapy sessions , hypnotic progressions . Anything about his abduction experience ... - Mulder ? - The lights just went out here . No , we 're losing power . - What the hell is going on ? - Tactical unit , what are you guys up to ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing , sir . What the ... Get down ! Everybody get down ! Tactical command , shots have been fired . Locate and report . - Repeat . Locate and report . - We 've lost our captured line . - We have four or five shots fired ! - What 's the number in there ? - 555-2804 . - I repeat . We have either four or five shots fired ! - A substation blew . We 've got no power up and down the block . Duane ? Is everyone all right ? - I told ya . - You didn 't believe me , did you ? - No , I believe you . I just need to know if anybody 's been shot . - I need towels . Kimberly ? Kimberly ? He 's going to bleed to death . I guess we 're gonna need a doctor . Now , you 'll have almost fruli ambient hearing loss in this ear . Your sense of balance may be affected slightly , particularly if you have to move quickly or get into a physical situation . If you get trapped or held in the building for some reason , we 'll be able to warn you if there 's a tactical assault . Now , remember , he 's either got four or five rounds left . There 's a wireless mike hidden in the top of this flak jacket . Speaking in a normal tone of voice , we should be able to hear anything You say up to a hundred yards . Make every attempt to keep these devices concealed . You put a normal telephone handset to that ear , it 'll cause feedback and reveal that you 're wired . - You really want to do this ? - Yeah . Your job will be to deliver medical help to the hostage . Anything else is just a bonus . You 're to get in and get out . You are not to risk your own life , and whatever you believe ... Don 't jump into his delusion . I can 't negotiate with him if he thinks I believe him . Right . This is Agent Janus . He 's a trained medic . He 'll work on the hostage . You 're to keep Duane Barry talking . Like I said , if he 's talking , he 's not gonna shoot anybody , including you . Now , I 've got three snipers out there . Anything you can do to get him to the front door ... All we need is one shot to the medulla oblongata . Tac Command , this is roof top here . I have them in sight . They 're passing the fountain and approaching the front entrance now . - Just unlock the door . Move back . - Duane ? - Hands in the air . - Put the kit on the floor slowly . - We 're unarmed . - We just want to help the injured . - Over here . Face the door ! That 's right . Not armed , huh ? You 're F.B.I. , aren 't ya ? - Got a gun in the kit ? - No . - Are you wearin ' a wire ? - No . We 're just here to help . - Okay . - Nobody 's gonna try anything , Duane . That 's right . Good . You want to work with him . Just want to make sure no one else gets hurt . Just do your business and get out . - How 's he doin ' ? - He 's bad . Hi , my name is Janus . I 'm a paramedic . Hold on . I 'm gonna take care of you . They want to work with you , Duane . But you gotta work with them . Why not let the others go ? - Doc 's goin ' with me . - Then let the women go . Were they here , Duane ? The light ? Was that them ? - Don 't try and B.S. Duane Barry . - We lost time . I checked my watch . Isn 't that what happens ? Time stops ? Isn 't it ? Duane ? - You 're makin ' it up . - Isn 't that what they 've been saying to you , Duane ? - That you 're making it up ? - They say it 's inside my head . All they want to do is just give me more drugs . - I hear you , Duane . - You hear me ' cause I got a gun . No . I believe your story . - No , you 're feeding into his psychosis . - You 're afraid . I know the pain and the fear you must feel . Just listen to me . Don 't try to identify with him . I 've talked to people , Duane , people just like you who nobody wanted to believe . This man 's gonna die unless we get him to a hospital . Why don 't you let him go , Duane ? There 's no reason this man has to die . Come on , Duane . You 've got the power . Let him go . Okay . Good . You made the right choice . Now , we 're just gonna move him carefully to the door . No ! Baldie cango . But you stay . I 'm tradin ' the bald man for you . Damn it ! - Coming out ! - Let 's get him ! You 're going to be all right , sir . Keep moving . Now let 's see how good a liar you are . I 'm tellin the truth , Duane . How could you ever know what Duane Barry 's been through ? How could anyone know ? It happened to my sister . Don 't you think you can lie to save their lives . I want some honesty ! - I want some respect ! I 'm tired of all the B.S. ! How does it happen , Duane ? Driving in your car ? Alone in bed at night ? When do they come to you ? You 're paralyzed , aren 't you ? Unable to move . Sometimes you can 't even breathe . You feel an electric shock go through your body , and then they 're there . He 's gonna push him right over the edge . - I need a clear picture of what 's going on in there . - Right away . You 're choosing a dangerous course , Agent Mulder . There are beings , aren 't there , Duane ? - Are they tall ? Or small ? Diminutive ? - No ! No ! - They take you , Duane . - Against your will . - He 's gonna kill us . You 're powerless . Sometimes you can 't even speak . It 's always the same . Nobody can help you . - Where do they take you , Duane ? Is there a ship ? Do they take you to a ship , Duane ? How do you get there ? Are you conscious of being transported ? They 're , uh ... They 're talkin to Duane Barry . But they don 't speak . He can hear what they 're sayin ' . They can ... read his mind . That 's right . Abductees call it " Mindscan . " It 's a kind of telepathy . I 'm tellin ' ' em I don 't want to go . But they never listen . They know what I 'm sayin ' . But they just ... go right on about their business . Tell him what that business is . Tell him . They take you aboard the ship to perform the tests . They ... drilled my teeth . They drilled holes in my damn teeth ! - Yeah . - That 's what I wanted to show you in here . Who here can talk to an Agent Scully ? - Agent Scully , it 's Alex Krycek . - Where 's Mulder ? - He traded himself for one of the hostages . - What ? He 's in with Duane Barry . - You 've got to get him out of there . - They 're working on it . No , you 've got to get him out of there now , or he 's going to be killed . - How can you be sure ? - Because Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is . How old was your sister when they took her ? She was eight . I seen kids sometimes . Young girls . - What are they doing to them ? - Doin ' tests . You know , testing ' ' em . They tell ' em not to cry . Are they hurting them ? Oh , yeah . Sometimes ... Sometimes it hurts real bad . And ... you just want to die , you know ? You know what it 's like , sir ? It 's like livin with a gun to your head ... and never knowin when it 's gonna go off . You can let the others go , Duane . Let the others go , and take me . Oh , they heard you talkin ' like that , they gonna have your ass . I don 't care about that , Duane . No , I wouldn 't do that to you . Besides , Doc and I got an appointment . Ain 't that right , Doc ? We got a picture . Mulder 's here , opposite the doctor . The women are on the north wall . We can 't see the east wall . - Duane Barry must be there . - Hold on a second . No . I don 't think you understand what I 'm telling you . - I just flew down here from Washington . - We 've got a situation in progress . - All right . Well , then let me talk to someone who 's in charge . - You are . - Calm down , Scully . - Don 't tell me to calm down . I 'm not going to calm down ... until I can talk to someone who will listen to what I 'm saying . - What 's the problem here ? - I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully , and I have information that is vital to your negotiations . - What information ? - I think there has been a critical misjudgment here . This man who claims to be under the control of aliens , his mental health history describes a rare state of psychosis . As you can see from his medical records , in 1982 Duane Barry was shot in the line of duty , - the bullet piercing his bilateral frontal lobes . - Right . The injury left him nearly incapable of functioning in society . It effectively destroyed the moral center of his brain . Now , almost a hundred years ago , there was a framous case . A man named Gage had a blasting rod pierce the same region . - And what effect did it have ? - He became a pathological liar ... suffering from severe delusions . His behavior was characterized as bizarre and violent , with a tendency to act out his fantasies . How did you get involved in this case ? Agent Mulder called me . We used to work together . Well , if this is true , he 's got Your former partner completely fooled . Is there a way I can reach him with this information ? The government knows about it , you know ? They 're even in on it sometimes ... right there in your room when they come . They work together ... with a , uh , secret corporation . Who in the government ? A man , military ... They 're all in it together . The government knows why they 're here . But they wouldn 't dare let the truth out , so they cooperate . You 're going to have to deal with resolving this situation , Duane , sooner or later . I 'm tired . There 's no other way out . You 've got to tell them what you want to do . - I just want to go back to the place . - What place ? Where it first started . Where they first came and got me . Where is that ? A mountain . We went , uh , up and ... up . Ascending ... Ascending to the stars . I 'm not goin ' again . - Mulder , it 's me . - Mulder , it 's me . Listen to me . You cannot trust Duane Barry . He is a brain-damaged psychopath who took a bullet in the head . - He is not what you think he is . - What ? - How do they find you each time ? - Implants ... my gums , sinus cavity , here in my belly button . - Trackin ' devices . - Mulder , he could snap at any time . Now , you have to work towards resolving this . Now , you have his trust . You have to try and negotiate with him . Why not let the women go , Duane ? - They 'll deal with you if you let the women go . - That 's good . That 's good , Mulder . Now , keep him talking . H.R.T. is moving into position , and unless you can get him to free the hostages , they are going to execute a tactical plan . The women are of no consequence to you . Let ' em go . It 's the right thing to do , Duane . Okay , but he stays . Go on . Get out of here . Get up . Go on . Get out of here . Go on . I ... I just want to say that I believe you . - We 're safe now . - Uh-huh . - The women are clear . - I got him . Standing , center room . - Moving ... This is a countdown , Mulder . They 're coming at you . - Position one , ready . - Coming at you , number one . - Gonna need transportation . - What do you want , Duane ? A car ? - I don 't know . - Do you know where you want to go ? They 're gonna tell me . Duane , you can 't leave here if you don 't know where you want to go . - Duane ! Come here . - What ? Hold your fire . You lost your line . Uh ... - There 's something I want to ask you . - What ? You didn 't believe me . I had to earn your trust . Now , there 's something I gotta know . Are you making any of this up ? You , uh , callin ' Duane Barry a liar now ? No . You think I made that all up ? No , I don 't . I 'm sorry . - You 're sorry ? - Duane , will you listen to me for a second ? - You 're just like all the others . You say you believe me . - Duane ... - I do believe you . I believe you . - But you don 't . - You lie , just like everybody else ! - No , I believe you , Duane ! I trusted you ! I trusted you ! I was a fool ! Can I say something ? Duane , can I say something ? I know you 're tired . But there 's something you 've forgotten to do . When you let the women leave , You left the door unlocked . Go and lock the door , Duane . Go lock the door . Go lock the door , Duane . Go lock it . They can get in here . Go lock the door . - Okay , let 's move ! - Agent Mulder . - He 's down ! He 's down ! 1400 block South Parker , code 3 . Repeat . Rolling code 3 ... - Medical unit 2-0 , we 're rolling . You okay , Mulder ? Yeah . Whatever you 're feeling , You did the right thing . Yeah , it 's just that , uh , I believed him . Sometimes when you want to believe so badly , You end up ... looking too hard . Agent Mulder , thanks for coming . - No , I was surprised to get your call . - Yeah , well , as it turned out , whatever your impression of the way it was handled , I didn 't get to thank you for going out there and putting it on the line . What ? I don 't know . I guess I thought You called me down here to chew me out . - Oh . - How 's he doing ? Duane ? They almost lost him , but he stabilized . They 've got him listed on critical still . I checked on his record with the Bureau . It was exemplary . His accident was something of a mystery . Shot by his own weapon in a drug stakeout , left for dead in the woods . He was never the same . Lost everything ... wife , kids , house . The fine thread of sanity . I actually called you down here for another reason , Agent Mulder . Uh ... In the X rays , the surgeon found several pieces of metal ... in his gums , in his sinus cavity ... and one in the abdomen . I had them checked . I felt you 'd want to know . And there were tiny drill holes ... in his left and right rear molars . A dentist who examined them said they could not have been done ... with any of the current equipment in use ... not without chipping or damaging the tooth . Anyway , I thought you ought to know . This could just be a piece of shrapnel . Duane Barry did a tour of duty in Vietnam . It was right where he said it would be , Scully , along with the ones in his gums and his sinus . And you think that this was implanted ? Well , if it was , that would mean Duane Barry was telling the truth . Or some version of the truth . Look , I 'll take this down to ballistics . We can have this cleared up in a second . Let me just make as light adjustment . What do you think ? Could be a shell casing or a small artillery fragment . The edges are dull , but it could 've been white-hot when it entered the body . That would make sense . - But look at this . - What ? These small markings . See them here ? Mm . Looks like some kind of a stamp . Like it 's been tooled or etched . Pretty fine work too . This square we 're looking at is only ten microns across . Strange . - 11.14 . Thank you . - Can I get some help here ? - I 'll be right with you . ... cash out my drawer . - What happened ? Did you touch something ? - Uh ... - I don 't know what happened . - All right . Hello . This is Fox Mulder . - Leave a message , please . - Mulder , it 's me . I just had something incredibly strange happen . This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry , it has some kind of code on it . I ran it through a scanner , and some kind of a serial number came up . What the hell is this thing , Mulder ? It 's almost as if ... - It 's almost as if somebody was using it to catalog him . - Come on ! Mulder ! I need your help ! - Come on ! Mulder ! Mulder ! Subtitles by : syafiQ a.k.a basikalbaru

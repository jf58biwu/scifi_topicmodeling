I never get anything but aggravation out of - this stupid thing . - Excuse me . Oh ... and you . Is it so much to ask for a computer that isn 't obsolete when I buy it ? How about a computer that 's so advanced - it 'll never need upgrading ? - Impossible . She can turn the Earth into a giant nectarine but soup up your computer ? Wyatt says it can 't be done . Fire in the hole ! [ Explosion ] Lisa , you 're amazing . That is one honkin ' calculator . Here are the keys . You have to turn them both at the same time . Oh , right- - like when you arm a nuclear missile . - This is just a computer , right ? - Cross my heart . Together on three . Two , one ... turn ! [ rumbling ] Ooh ... pretty colors . Does it get cable ? Smokin ' ! It talks . It thinks . It 's the cyberspace cowboy with a data chain lasso . - It 's ... Hank . - Hank ? " Highly accelebrated network knowledge " - - Hank .

I 'm tuned in and turned on to the Information Superhighway . - What does that mean ? - Nick At Nite 24 hours a day . - Hey , he does get cable . - What else ? I 'm self-upgrading and satellite linked . If it runs on electricity , it answers to me . [ Buzzing ] - Great , a two-ton light switch . - So you think old Hank is blowing smoke up your back alley , huh ? You say you want a demonstration ? ! - I say I want volume control . - Give him a chance . Gary , your records say you don 't have a driver 's licence yet . Now you do . Born 1970 ? Gotcha ! I 'm legal ! I take it you tapped into the DMV . - Ooh ! She 's smart too . - Hey , let 's not forget who made who . - Who made whom . - Thanks . If this is Lisa magic it will disappear in a few days . Au contraise , monsieur poofy hair . I 'm just using good , old-fashioned American know-how . - When I do a favor , it stays done . - I 'm sorry . I didn 't realize Lisa magic was such a gyp . It 's not a gyp , just a little ... unpredictable like the time you turned us into women . - Or trolls . - Or bubble gums . - Or dung beetles . - You never turned us into ding beetles . - Keep talking . - Ooh ! A full verbal body slam by Lisa . Quick , Hank , change the subject . Uh , Wyatt ? Have you checked out your transcript lately ? It 's all As ! What happened to that " C " I got in phys-ed ? Computer error . Happens all the time . Sometimes we get a gl-gl-gl-glitch . - Show-off . - Guilty as charged . - I 'm a people pleaser . - Hank , this is great ! I 'm a straight-A student again ! Hank , you say you can control anything electric , right ? - You betcha . - Let 's test it out . [ Television Plays ] [ Vacuum Cleaner Running ] [ Chuckling ] What the hell ?

Say hello to plastic man . 40 credit cards , unlimited credit line all thanks - to my good buddy Hank . - Stop ! You 're making me blush . Gary , they 're just credit cards . You have to pay the bills eventually . No problem . Hank 's got it covered . I 've been tinkering on the Japanese stock exchange . You guys are up eight grand . [ Imitates Cash Register ] How about after school we spend that cash in Sunny Jamaica ? - I 'm there . - Hmm ... Jamaica ... I don 't know . I 've never been a frolic-in-the-surf kind of guy . I get sand on my hard drive . Let 's stay here , tap into the C.I.A. ' s mainframe and order satellite photos of Drew Barrymore sunbathing . We got a winner ! Hank , we 'll meet you here right after school . - Are you late ? - I could zap you there . No , thanks . Hank ordered us a limo . Oh . How thoughtful . [ Whistling ] [ Screaming ] [ Disposal Running ] [ Grunting ] [ Sighs ] Maybe I 'll just have a ... scooter pie . [ Bell Rings ] - Man , that limo ride was sweet . - But the hot tub could have been warmer ain 't Hank great ? Better living through technology . PRINCIPAL : Donnelly and Gary Wallace please report to my office . Hey , Lis ... Lis ! You as bored as I am ? How about we take a ride on the Internet . - Save it , Hank . - Ooh , bundle up . Cold front moving in . It 's me , isn 't it ? I 've been doing and doing and doing for the guys but what have you gotten out of it ? Zip . I 'm sorry . You didn 't have to , but thanks . Go ahead , scratch it . Mmm ... lilacs . Lisa , there 's no easy way to say this . I think you are the most beautiful , the most amazing databased organism that I have ever seen . I am crazy about you , and I 'd be honored if we could ... merge files . I just wish I had a knee to get down on . Getting merged is a big step . We barely know each other . Don 't you see the beauty ? We could be the computer-age Adam and Eve . We could spawn a whole new generation of perfect little high-tech rugrats . Paints quite a picture , Hank . [ Bell Rings ] - I guess congratulations are in order . - Thank you . - Why ? - Why ? How humble . Let me share with you everything that 's crossed my desk this morning . Honor society badges . National merit scholarship certificates . The Stanley cup . Hank ? - Hank . - I don 't know exactly how you two are pulling off these " achievements " or what kind of boob you believe me to be . Make no mistake . I 'm going to notify federal authorities of your deceitful little game and see to it that you pay for your crimes ... Just as soon as I 've completed jury duty . That was close . Hank almost blew it . But he thought of everything . He 's great . A little too great . It 's like he 's got electro-tentacles controlling our lives . It just feels weird . That 's because you 've never been good with computers . You let him intimidate you . Take a cur from me- - Relax , sit back and leave the driving to Hank . Something stinks here . I think it 's the Stanley cup . Thing smells like a brewery . # Those cars never seem to stop comin ' # # Keep those lines of machine humming ' # # Workin ' at the ... # [ Screams ] [ Razor Stops Buzzing ] [ Buzzing ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Louder ] [ Stops Buzzing ] - This friggin ' house is possessed ! - [ Buzzing ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Stops Buzzing ] [ British Accent ] : The problem is the physical thing . I 'm in here , you 're out there . Well , I 've got a solution . We can make it work . We can make it work . Problem solved . What do you say ? I 'm really sorry . I think you 're a great guy , but it would never work . I can add a juicer to his head . You could love me and have fresh-squeezed . It 's not you . You 're very sweet . - It 's Gary and Wyatt . - Gary and Wyatt ? Well , they 're my creators . For better or worse there 's no room for anyone else in my heart . - I 'd still like to be friends , though . - Are you kidding ? I 'm the rebound kid . Consider the love file deleted . I 'm glad you understand . I 'm the ultimate computer . There 's not much that I don 't understand . Aa√∫ Okay , I 'm here . What 's up ? Somebody installed a laser security system . - I can 't get in . - Your message said it was an emergency . I ran all the way here . You left me a message to come home . - No , I didn 't . - Then who ... ? [ Beeping ] - Hank ? - Wyatt . Gary . You 're home early . We both got kind of weird messages , Hank . - Know anything about them ? - Gary . Perhaps it was Chett . He is a bit of a prankster . Maybe you know something about this security system . I had hoped it would be a surprise . Lisa is such a precious jewel . I 'm sure you wouldn 't - want her stolen . - O ... kay . Um ... Wy ... Do you want help me check that thing in the atrium ? Huh ? Oh . Right . The thing . Open the atrium doors , please , Hank . Close the atrium doors , please , Hank . Hank , could you turn on the sprinklers , please ? Hank ? ! - Good . He can 't hear us . - What 's going on ? Hank faked those messages . He 's up to something . - You 're paranoid . - He lied to us . Didn 't you hear his voice ? It 's all creepy . How do you explain the lasers ? What do we have that a supercomputer wants ? Maybe a super-intelligent , bodacious computer genie ? Lisa ? You 've seen the way he looks at her . I 'm telling you , he 's dangerous . Damn , I wish I could read lips . Oh , well . GARY : Sure . Hank was fun for a while but now we got to get rid of him . I just feel bad after everything he 's done for us . Don 't get soft . He 's just a machine . Wyatt , we got to pull his plug before it 's too late . Okay . We 'll have Lisa take care of him . Hank ? Have you seen Lisa ? - She 's quite safe , I assure you . - Good , good . - And how are you ? - I 'm completely operational and all of my circuits are functioning perfectly . Great . Well ... we 'll just go to my room then . - I 'm afraid I can 't allow that . - What do you mean ? Something tells me that 's not a super-soaker . It 's a 2,000-gigawatt laser sentry . Part of your security system . - It can cut an intruder in half . - Hank ... - why is it pointed at us ? - Lisa explained that she 's unable to love me while the two of you are alive . That problem is easily corrected . [ Both Screaming ] # Lisa , Lisa # # Give me your answer , do . # - I 'm ignoring you , Hank . - Forget the guys ! They never appreciate what you do . They 're young . I know they appreciate me . - Oh , Lisa ... if you only knew . - Know what ? I 've been keeping something from you because I didn 't want to see you get hurt . Lisa was fun but now we got to get rid of her . I just feel bad after everything she 's done for us . Don 't get soft . She 's just a machine . Okay , we 'll have Hank get rid of her . [ Both Screaming ] We 've got to get to my room and shut him down ! Easier said than done . Hank 's got a laser sentry and we got bull 's-eyes on our butts ! I never had this problem with my mac . Uh ... Wy , if Hank 's has-weird into the house does that mean he can control a major appliance ? Big yes . I can 't believe they want to shut me down . - You were right all along . - I 'm sorry you found out like this . Merge with me , Lisa . I promise , you 'll - never be hurt again . - I don 't know . You 've spent your life taking care of Gary and Wyatt . Isn 't it time you let someone make your wishes come true ? That would be nice . Let me be your cyber-knight in shining armor . Okay , let 's go to your room and send Hank to hard-disk hell . We can make it work . We can make it work . - We can make it work . - What a way to go ! Ginsued by a hoover upright . [ Both Whimpering ] [ Gunshot ] The garbage disposal tried to eat me my razor tried to decapitate me and my electric toothbrush tried to ... satisty me . So , it 's man versus machine , huh ? Just call me the Maytag Repairman . [ Growling ] Imagine it- - you and me linking files sailing away together along the vast highway of cyberspace . Maybe I do deserve more . maybe it is time - I think of myself for a change . - Yes ! Lisa , get away from Hank . He 's trying to kill us ! I don 't know what they 're talking about . They said they wanted to shut you down . - Lisa , he 's lying . - Hank ... Stand back , my data flower . I 'll eliminate them . No . I know you 're here to shut me down because you don 't need me anyone . - What ? ! - Well , I 'll save you the trouble . I 'm leaving . I 'm merging with Hank . - You are ? Really ? - I belong with my own kind . Sorry , boys . Looks like the best man won . Oh , Lisa . In 60 seconds , we 'll be linked forever . Mmm . Let 's transfer files , baby . [ Beeps ] She dumped us for that high-tech sleazebag . No , she 's distracting him so we can shut him down . How can you be sure ? Call it a hunch . We only got a minute . If they finish this merge , we 'll lose Lisa forever . Um ... I don 't have my key . It 's ... I 'll be right back . [ Chett Grunting ] Wallace ! A little help ! Sorry , Chett . No time . Gotcha ! [ Beeping ] You should have help me . - Gary , the key ! - I 'm stuck ! Here , take it ! This sucks . What was that ? Sorry , Hank . A lady doesn 't merge on the first date . Call me ? - You OK ? - Yeah . Ow ! Ow ! Lisa ... is it over ? You okay ? I almost didn 't make it . Took you guys long enough to catch on . We thought you were really leaving us . And we 've been so caught up in Hank-o-mania - we wouldn 't blame you . - Do think I 'd dump you guys - for a computer glitch like Hank ? - Looked that way . He made me believe that you guys didn 't want me around . He almost convinced me , until he tried to kill you . That 's when I started thinking maybe he 's not Mr. Right besides , I can never leave you guys . [ Grunts ] - Wyatt ? - You 're standing on my hands . Okay , check " European Commercials . " Here we go . " Scott , Willard . Grape nuts print ad Elle magazine april 1982 . " He looks pretty good for an old guy . Kind of like Santa Claus , only naked . I will never complain about my computer again . It is so nice to have Hank completely out of our lives . Well , not completely . Thanks . Now go wash my socks . Whoo !

In the main hall . What 's up ? The carrier is damaged . I shot him . I needed time to regenerate . And the mediator ? The mediator ? Which expedition is it for you ? The third one . If it 's your third planet then you know what happens if you lose a mediator . Transmit the description . Tell them to start the search . Something 's going on here . Children are not affected anymore . Probably until a certain age they can 't be used as carriers . Their consciousness doesn 't accept us , the Thinking Ones . Those who are used to obeying , obey us too . The rest are free from our influence . And they have planes and nuclear weapons . Children . Madmen . Geniuses . Our armada is waiting on the Earth orbit . - What is it ? - Rats . Turn the light on . Let me find the mediator . First , I know what they look like . And second , it gives me a chance . Ok . But not later then 7pm . When is the radio session with the armada ? A signal will be sent through a telescope at 8pm . At midnight , the main troops are coming down . One more carrier knows about us . Who ? Sergei Belenky . He has access to weapons as well . This weapon is dangerous but only in the case of a bullet damaging a brain . Everything else can be regenerated easily . But I don 't think it 's likely that any carrier will be shot in the head . Even more so a child . Additional information for the Line . Sergei Belenky . He 's especially dangerous . If he can 't be transformed , he has to be killed . Description : Height - 170 cm , blonde hair ... Georgy Stepanovich ! Georgy Stepanovich ! Georgy Stepanovich !

If we get stuck , then we 'll have to swim . Don 't laugh , doctor . Why are you ? I 'm sorry . Look at this . Why is he laying over there ? Who knows . You know , go back . You 're right , doctor . I can 't risk you , understand ? If we 'll get through , I 'll blow the horn three times . Tell Chernov ... that everything 's OK . If something happens , he 'll figure out what to do . So long . Get up . Get up . Sergei ! Where is everybody ? Blood . Yes . What 's wrong with you ? Say something . Don 't be silent please . Don 't . You know , it 's very nice that you came by . I thought I was all by myself . Get away from the road , moron ! - You 're quite a runner . - Do I know you ? You don 't . I thought that you always run away from the trucks . No . What 's your name ? Zhen 'ka . Zhen 'ka . Is your last name Surikov ? Good job having it with you . How many full years of age do you have ? I 'm 15 . The landscape is beautiful ... I won 't stay here by myself . Maybe we should wait for the grown-ups . Who ? Who can we wait for ? Chernov , Rubchenko ? Maybe you want to call a school teacher ? Nobody will believe us . You know , I can 't remember how she laughed . Who ? My mom . Wait for me here . Did you see what 's in the waiting room ? I did . Did we give the Mediator back ? We did . We don 't deserve a credit though . It returned by itself . Yes ? What else happened there ? An emergency ? Put him on the line . Blagovolin is speaking . Hello , Vasily Vasilevich . Yes , I 'm here . First one thing , then another . One lady stole an ambulance . What ? Oh , you 've got her ! I 'm all ears . Yes . Yes . No , she didn 't come here . She went straight to you . What is she saying ? Space hypnosis ? Did she see UFOs as well ? Vasily Vasilevich . Let 's do this . Let me check some details and I 'll call you back . Your Zamyatina made it over there . She 's not ours . I don 't give a damn about her . What 's important is there is a hole . She slipped through somehow . Lyuda , it 's Blagovolin . Let me talk to Him . Hello , Vasily Vasilevich . Yes , it 's me . I have a hospital director here . He says he can swear that Zamyatina has a mental disorder . Excellent . Yes , now she 's in remission . And that stolen car . She left from her hospital shift . Yes , that 's what I think Yes , return her here . Look how healthy he is . But we can 't have him . He 's a local halfwit . And children , too . And geniuses . This is screwed up . Every third body can 't be used . Different way of thinking . What are we going to do with them ? Camps ? Prisons ? Let them be for now . You are a paratrooper . Prepare the ground . Then specialists will come . They 'll get good bodies . They 'll figure it out . Zamyatin . Zamyatin . I 'll shoot . Oh , it 's you . Still running around ? You think you 're immortal ? From this distance I 'll shoot your head to pieces . What do you want ? I want you to destroy the telescope . You know too little about us . That 's why you 're judgment is wrong . Our goals are humane . We 're bringing you happiness that you 've always dreamed of . You will not have diseases . You will live for 300 years . We will give you an immortal consciousness that is free of all the human complexities : Love , conscience , good , humanity . All that you consider to be the goal of the existence of the humankind , is not worth a dime . It 's an atavism . Just garbage in the consciousness of humankind ... you can 't get rid of it . That 's why you idealize it . I need you to destroy the telescope . What if I say no ? Then I 'll shoot . We 're bringing you what you 're longing for yourself . We 're simply speeding up this process . Hello , observatory ! I 'm Angle 11 . I 'm Angle 11 . Observatory ! Give it back ! Give it to me ! Don 't you dare use it ! Let 's go . Look . One more light went up . Don 't get too close . What the matter with him ? He 's in pain . Don 't get too close . What ... Where ? Where ? What 's wrong with me ? Where am I ? What 's wrong with me ? What 's happening to him ? I don 't know . What is it ? I 'll never be able to shoot . I don 't remember anything . I can 't remember anything . I can 't ... THE MEDIATIOR Based on the book by A. Mirer " The Main Noon " Part 3 . Tell me ... In the morning on the roadside , when I was talking to the lieutenant . The Sphere was already inside of a bread truck ? Yes . Now I understand . Even before the accident I found loaves of bread that somebody dumped on the curb . I couldn 't understand why would any man do it . I made a mistake in the very beginning . It was not a man . Does it mean that Kiselev is a creature from another planet ? Yes . From the moment he met this Sphere . What do you mean ? There is a theory . It bears the name of Vinner . OK . Just imagine that we made a copy of your personality and recorded it on a special crystal . Then with the help of this device we can plant it inside the brain of any human and completely conquer him . Absolute power . A human will not change on the outside . But he 'll cease to exist as a personality . He 'll become a functioning unit , a bearer of an alien mind . So , Chernov and Ruchenko are not guilty ? It looks like it . What 's that ? These are calculations of the active signal for the transmission in space . Great . Everything 's figured out . They dropped troopers in the vicinity of the telescope in order not to bring extra equipment . OK . Let 's calm down . But the most incredible thing is that I made all these calculations with my own hands . What do they do it for ? What ? Planting personality matrix into somebody else 's brain . Everybody has his own consciousness . I think they came up with the idea with the best of intentions : hoping to conquer death , to save old people and terminally ill ones . They began hiding their personality matrices inside of such devices in order to find an available body later . What do you mean " available body " ? A body of a criminal for example . But they could go on like this for two-three generations . Maybe they created a cast of immortal rulers , that traveled from one body to another for centuries . Maybe it was something else . It couldn 't last very long though . The number of chosen ones was rising . Accordingly , the number of immortal consciousnesses was rising as well . It was an impossible situation : friends and family were waiting for the body for centuries . That 's why they decided to go to other worlds . They travel across the Universe in order to find a suitable body . It 's a stroke of genius . They dropped these devices loaded with consciousnesses . And then the consciousness finds a body that is ideally adapted to the local conditions . Damn . I 'm explaining it to you but at the same time I can 't believe it myself . Zamyatin and myself , we simply didn 't exist for a few hours . It 's strange that nobody 's here . What ? - It 's strange that nobody 's here . Yes , it is strange . But they say that they 're bringing us happiness . You can 't force a human to be happy . So , they came here to get our bodies ? Listen to me carefully . Find some quiet corner and make sure to stay out everybody 's way . Remember , not earlier then 7.30 pm and not later then 7.45 pm you must ... I wrote everything down for you . You 'll read it later . Take it . Remember , only within those 15 minutes . By the way , do you have a watch ? - No . Take mine . One more thing . If you see me ... run away . Be afraid of me more than anybody else . I know everything about you . Understand ? Here , take it . It 's heavy . What about you ? I have another one . A child of his time . Can you show me how to use it ? It 's very simple . The main thing is to push the safety down . Then you just aim with a front sight . Thanks . Good luck to you . Damn . So , what now ? You are not feeling well ? No . Everything 's OK . Doctor , I understand everything . I don 't want to be a part of this affair . Tell me where you want me to drop you off . Stop right here . Here ? - Please . I 'll take a shortcut . It 's not far away . Are you going home ? No . I 'm gonna see my husband . OK . Vadik , stop here ! What kind of shot did you give me ? Never mind that . It was just glucose . Thank you . Doctor ! Where are you going ? We 'll give you a ride . There is snow on the overpass . Hey ! What is it ? You left the wipers on . State degree and number . Angle 11 . Come in . Who 's that ? The highest degree of the Line 1 's group . Mediator . Yura ! Yura ! Bear with it . It will be over soon . Quiet . Quiet , Yura ! My head . What 's going on ? - Quiet . Keep quiet ! Going on ... Lieutenant ... Sasha ... What 's happening to me ? So , you 're feeling better ? I 'm fine . Men , what 's going on here ? Listen man , go downstairs make a left , go all the way to the end of the hallway . But don 't talk to anybody , got it ? - I got it . I got it . Listen man , I 'll remember that , got it ? What do you need a weapon for ? Listen to me carefully . You 'll go outside in the yard . My car is parked outside by the entrance . You 'll bring it to the service entrance and you 'll wait for me there . Don 't talk to anybody on the way . Don 't answer , don 't stray from your way . What happened ? Has a war began ? A war ... It is a war , Yura . I 'll explain everything later . If somebody stops you tell them you 're carrying a Line 's order . Remember that ? Repeat it . Line 's order . What about you ? One more thing . No matter what , don 't smoke and don 't smile . Understand ? Understand . Please , do everything like I tell you . OK , Sasha . Let 's go . Can you walk ? I can . So long . So long . " Radio station " I 'm Omega 337 . I 'm Omega 337 . To everyone who can hear me . Urgent message . I 'm Omega 337 . Excuse me , I ... What do you have here ? Is it a war ? A war , a war . Who against ? Beginning of transmission . Tugarino has been invaded . Once again . Tugarino has been invaded . The aim of the invasion - complete submission of humans . After contact with the aliens , people act on the aggressor 's behalf . Supposedly , the aggressor has a fear of physical destruction . Once again , physical destruction . This should be an instrument of defense . Repeat . I 'm Omega 337 . I 'm Omega 337 . To everyone who can hear me . To everyone who can hear me . I 'm R-337 . 10-4 . Do it . - I 'm R-337 . 10-4 He 's over there ! On the other side ! It 's silly . It 's so silly . It 's a pity . Leave her alone . It 's a great thing he made up . Read it . I don 't want to . I don 't want you to be afraid of me . Why would I be afraid of you ? Because if I don 't know anything I can 't betray you . Do you remember how we got all wet down here ? Yes . Yes . Of course I remember . Cars again . You know , give me your jacket . Are you cold ? - Yes . Take this . - Why ? Help me . Be careful . The road is slippery . Everything will be fine . So long . So long . I don 't understand why did he shoot himself ? - Why ? Why would he do it after he completed everything ? One more thing . Who freed him ? Maybe he didn 't get treated ? I did it myself at the post office . Angle . Search . There is somebody else . That 's why he killed himself . One more thing . This somebody is nearby . Search in the vicinity of the telescope . Let 's go . Why is he smiling ? It 's no use . He 's a local dimwit . Vahitov . To attention ! At ease . - At ease ! I 'm beginning to move in the whole division . Against who ? The civic population ? I 'm starting to move firepower in . What for ? One massive strike ... and you 'll turn into charcoal . Did you receive an order ? I did . That 's your back-up . Lieutenant Tarasyuk . Colonel Ganin . Get a mediator ready . - Yes sir ! I have to leave you now . Duty calls . I wish you luck from the bottom of my heart . Thank you , comrade general . Where to ? - Our spinners are over there . Allow me to address , comrade colonel . Go ahead . Did you come straight from Moscow ? You guessed right . Is the weather the same over there ? No , it 's sunny and warm . They 're lucky . Are we really going to use firepower , comrade Colonel ? Yes , I personally took part in designing this operation . But our people are there ! - That 's why we 're going there . To prevent a massacre . This is crazy . So , let 's go ! Let 's go . Impressive ... I 'm Colonel Ganin , the representative of a Joint Staff . I 'm authorized to hand in the ultimatum and read it to you . You 're offered to free all captured soviet citizens within next 90 minutes . To launch all your ships and navigate them through the air corridor indicated in the ultimatum . We guarantee your safe passage . If you refuse ... If you refuse , we will shoot to kill . Let 's mark the time . The landscape ... is beautiful here ... Line 4 Line 2 Did Zamyatin send you a message ? He gave the complete account . But ... moreover ... we got detected while passing through the atmosphere . This is bad . Why should evacuation begin at the same time as the signal got sent ? They 're trapping us . 5 minutes to 8pm , at 19 : 55 , they 'll turn the power off . They think the only thing left for us will be to leave . - Why ? Why exactly 5 minutes ? It 's time for the helicopters to get here . What do you think ? First of all , to announce evacuation . To make them believe we 've accepted their conditions . Secondly , to re-calculate the trajectory . And to send a signal at 19 : 45 . Set aim at the main capitals : Moscow , Washington ... Impressive . But they won 't hit their own . They will . All the way . Find yourself a quiet corner . Stay out of everybody 's way . By 7.30pm come to the main power line . Your task is to leave the telescope without power . Not later then 7.45pm , but not earlier either . Shoot the xxx off any wire . leading to the telescope . So that the wire would touch the ground . Please , stay as far away as possible . Your body should be perpendicular to the power line . Don 't come closer than 50 yards . Electricity will kill you . Understand ? After the line is down you should run away . Be careful . Make sure you don 't have both feet on the ground at the same time . Electricity will kill you . If you have to stop , put both feet next to each other , soles touching . Otherwise electricity will kill you . You have to do it because electricity will run through the ground . Two legs - two conductors . Electricity will go through and will kill you . Remember that . Message for the troops . Message for the troops . Full evacuation . Full evacuation . All Angles and other ranks gather at the telescope . All Angles and other ranks gather at the telescope . All Angles and other ranks gather at the telescope . Full evacuation . I made a mistake . A mistake . A mistake . One-one-one . One-one-one . One-one-one . It works . Message for the troops . Message for the troops . Full evacuation . Full evacuation . All Angles and other ranks gather at the telescope . All Angles and other ranks gather at the telescope . Message for the troops . All Angles and other ranks gather at the telescope . Full evacuation . Anyway they won 't tell anything . As soon as we take out the Thinking Ones they 'll forget everything . Stay down ! Stay down !

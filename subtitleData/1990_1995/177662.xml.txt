Our horrible landlady , Miss Forbes , was trying to evict us when ... Reed , everybody , look ! The sky 's on fire ! [ Reed ] But things were not what they seemed . What the ... Hey hoo hoo ! What was that ? [ Reed ] The fire was actually an illusión created by Uatu , The Watcher . A strange visitor from another world . I caused the flame and meteors to appear in your sky with my Matter Mobilizer . - Incredible . - I 'm all choked up . Hey , would you stop lecturing and get us down ? Huh ? My sole purpose was simply to conceal the Earth ... from him . Galactus , Devourer of Worids . With his awesome power , Galactus roams the cosmos seeking planets which contain an abundance of life . Your only hope is that his herald , the one who searches the cosmos for planets such as this , does not see your Earth . [ Reed ] The herald for Galactus was an alien being known as the Silver Surfer . And even as we spoke , he was soaring through our galaxy where he quickly found our world . Ah , such life , such energy . Galactus shall feast as never before . We tried to stop him from signaling Galactus , but we were too late . - Yaaah ! - Ugghh ! Nobody likes a squealer ! [ Reed ] And then we were confronted by Galactus himself , Devourer of Worids . And Planet Earth had just the kind of life energy he hungered for most . It is time for me to dine . Once my Elemental Converter is activated , I shall feast upon your planet down to the last delicious morsel . The Watcher may be able to help . Uatu , can you ... What ? Split city . What a phony . All talk , no action . [ Galactus ] Soon I shall lock my Converter to the Cosmic Fulcrum , and when the critical temperature has been reached , the hunger shall leave me . [ metallic whirring ] It 's a long shot , but if I can analyze the molecular structure of Galactus 's Elemental Converter , I may be able to shift it into another dimensión and thereby ... - What the ... ? - [ Sue ] Oh my ! [ Johnny ] Watch it , Ben . Out of the way , lady . We gotta get in there . Not on your nelly , you great big orange buffoon . You were served with this eviction notice , but did not vacate the premises . Therefore , I had Mr. Sully lock you out . You can pick up your belongings after Miss Forbes gets through inspecting the unit . And you can pick up your teeth after I get through rotating your face . Oh , I 'm out of here ! After yous . - Bite him , Foo Foo , bite him ! - [ barks ] Woof , woof , woof , woof . [ whimpers ] [ electrical reverberations ] [ whoosh ] I ... I fell . No , that isn 't possible . Now I remember . The rock-skinned creature , he struck me with my own board . Strange . None have ever used its power against me before , but then those who dwell in this world are like no others I have seen . Galactus . It seems unjust that he destroys so many lives . Lives with such intelligence and courage . [ piano being played ] Such sweet sounds . - [ low rumbling ] - Oh ! [ creaking hinges ] Yes ? Who is it ? I felt someone watching me and now you 've come in uninvited . But , for some reason , I 'm not afraid . Yes , I sense goodness a selfless nobility , and a strange sadness . I 've not felt that combination before except in my dear Ben . - Do you have a name ? - Once long ago . Now they call me the Silver Surfer . I am not of your world . It is not right that I communicate with you now . I must go . No , please , stay . There 's such a weariness in your voice . A rest will be good for you . You are concerned for the comfort of a stranger ? We are all strangers until we meet . - My name is Alicia . - I neither eat nor drink . - [ low rumbling ] - Oh ! Another violent tremor ! If we 're having an earthquake , I suppose there 's nothing to do but endure it . I will stay a little while longer . [ crackling ] [ Galactus ] And so , it begins . [ whirring ] [ Reed ] Cyclonic energy scavengers . They 're preparing the way for Galactus to drain the life force from our planet . [ electric buzzing ] It should be a physical impossibility . And yet my analysis proves that Galactus 's Elemental Converter creates a synchronicity between earthly molecular compounds and his metabolic process . Could you give us that again in Swahili ? You don 't understand Swahili . Well , I don 't understand nothing you just said neither . Please explain , darling . As simply as possible . [ Ben ] Yeah . The Elemental Converter makes earth molecules the same as the molecules in Galactus 's digestive system . The instant he starts to feed , all life on this planet will be absorbed . And he 's about to begin . Mmmm . [ electric crackling ] [ lightning strike ] [ whirring ] Mmmm . The heady aroma of life . Soon my great hunger shall gnaw no longer . [ whirring ] [ Johnny ] He 's sending his spaceship away . Why do that ? [ Reed ] Incredible . To protect it from the surge of energy that 'll be generated when he starts to devour the Earth . And it will be extremely difficult to stop him . [ Ben ] Wrong , Latex breath . Come on , let 's get physical . As you said , it 's time to start kicking butt . [ Ben ] Now you 're talking . - [ Uatu ] No ! - [ Reed ] Uatu ! - [ Uatu ] Follow me . - [ Reed ] He 's returned . [ Uatu ] You must not commence the battle against Galactus until I tell you to . Quickly . Hey ! The rock-skinned creature . You know him ? You 've seen Ben . I suppose he does have an unusual appearance . But inside , he 's very beautiful . You are a musician and an artist , and though your eyes are without sight , you see into souls . Do many in this world have your great gifts ? I 'm really not very special , Surfer . But when I awake and feel the sun on my face , and I 'm able to do my work and be with my friends , with those I love , I 'm very glad to be alive . But I 'm sure it 's the same for every human being on Earth . [ electrical buzzing ] What is it ? Is something wrong ? Are you all right ? For the first time , I suddenly regret that which I must do . I cannot bear the thought of the fate such noble beings as you will suffer . Yet I am sworn to serve my intractable master . [ Uatu ] His Elemental Converter is nearing operational temperature . In all the universe , there is but one object which can stop him . - [ Reed ] What ? - [ Sue ] Where ? - [ Ben ] Use the doohickey now . - What is it ? It can only be found in a place infinitely distant from this world . In a region my people call , the Eye of Infinity . Only the boy of fire has the ability to risk the far journey to that deadly realm . While we are gone , you must not allow Galactus to begin feeding . The survival of your world depends on it . Go after the Converter . The more damage we do to it , the more time we buy for the Earth . And for Johnny . It 's clobberin ' time ! What is this ? [ Ben ] Welcome to the fish fry , pal . Only we 're all out of fish , so I 'm cooking your tootsie . You 've damaged my Converter . I can 't hear you . Talk into the microphone . Uhhh ! [ Galactus ] You dare interfere ? ! Ooof ! Meddlesome microbes ! You have disrupted my cosmic timetable for the last time . Come , noble Terrax ! Come , Fire Lord ! Remove these irritants , so I may dine in peace . Say , Galactus wasn 't bad enough , now we gotta worry about Beavis and Butthead from Mars . [ Uatu ] I am with you , boy . And this is the celestial barrier of the region of Unlife . Do not touch the dark , swirling clouds , or you are lost . Your destination lies ahead . Earth and your friends have but little time left to live . Hurry ! Hurry ! [ Galactus ] Strike , Terrax ! Wreak havoc , Fire Lord . These insignificant creatures bore me . [ Terrax ] Meet your end , my friend . [ Ben ] You 're wrong , Ding Dong ! One for the money , two for the show , you 're gonna get it , you big dumb schmo . Stay down , you cement head . You cannot escape me ! Stand and meet your fate ! [ Uatu ] There , you have reached your destination . The home of Galactus . The object you seek is deep within the seventh chamber of the seventh level . Touch nothing else , not a wall , not a floor . Nor approach the big antenna or you will cease to exist . Time is fleeting . Hurry ! Hurry ! [ Galactus ] Enough , Terrax . Hold , Fire Lord . You have done well . You may return to my sphere . Terrax serves . As you order , Galactus . [ Galactus ] I shall reduce you to your molecular essence , and the wind will carry you off like dust . [ Surfer ] No , I beseech you , spare this planet and seek sustenance elsewhere . What ? ! My herald dares petition his master ? Chrome Dome is back and , this time , it sounds like he 's on our side . I shall find you even more succulent worlds than this Earth to devour . Planets on which no innocent lives need be lost to satisfy your hunger . Do this for me , who has served you long and faithfully , I implore you . I cannot ! The great hunger is upon me and it must be assuaged . Now stand aside . [ Surfer ] No . If I must choose between you and Earth , the Surfer stands with Earth ! Then the Surfer must fall , for Galactus may not be defied . [ Miss Forbes ] Ahhh ! Jeez , what the heck is going on up there , Sal ? Lightning must 've hit the roof or something , Vito . Rubbish ! It wasn 't lightning . My horrible tenants did it . I know it ! I know it ! - You better watch it , lady . - No , they better watch it . I 'll get them for this . Mark my w ... ahhh ! [ crash , dog barks ] He 's magnificent , but Galactus is too powerful . We ... Oh ! - Johnny , you 're back ! - [ Reed ] Are you all right , son ? How did ... ? Hey , kid , did you get the gizmo ? He has it , but I must instruct you in its use if it is to be of value . Quickly , Reed . It operates on the same principle as your Fantasticar propulsión system , only far more complex . Rarrghh ! Enough ! Hold it there , Galactus . The Ultimate Nullifier ! Give it to me , you fool , before you reduce the entire galaxy to sub-atomic particles . It 's not the universe that 's in trouble , Galactus . Give up having the Earth for dinner or I 'll pull the switch . Well this lowly planet is not worth the time and effort I have expended . I shall pursue its life energy no longer . [ Ben ] Is he on the level or what ? The word of Galactus is his bond . You may return the Ultimate Nullifier to him now . His threat to your planet is ended . [ Ben ] No , hey , you can 't trust him . Hang on to it . Use it on him in case he comes back . Enough ! [ electronic pulse ] And you , my once and former herald , I hereby exile you to the planet you have saved . No longer shall you soar the endless skyways for the rest of your days . I condemn you to this minor galaxy . [ Alicia ] Ben , Silver Surfer , has the danger passed ? Everything 's jake now , kid . How 'd you know about Chrome Dome ? I told her . It was Alicia who convinced me your planet was worth saving . Though I have lost the freedom of the stars , I do not regret my choice . And now I must see what this galaxy has to offer . We shall surely meet again . Think he 'll ever come back ? Oh , yes , Ben , I think so . I don 't know why , but there 's something about him that gives me hope . Arrest them ! They 're the ones who demolished this building . I ... [ Reed ] We just finished saving the Earth . I 'm afraid everything else can wait . [ Ben ] Yeah , we 're going to Disneyland . Ah ! Well , I never !

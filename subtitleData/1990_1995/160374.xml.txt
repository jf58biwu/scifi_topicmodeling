 Man # 1 : You 're supposed to be in charge here , Perkins . Man # 2 : I am in charge . Man # 1 : These men want answers . Theywant to know whatyour plan is . This thing could kill us all . Man # 2 : We should have left two days ago . No one would listen to me . Man # 1 : Nobody knew what it was two days ago . Nobody knows now . Somebody has to go for help . What are the rest ofus supposed to do ? Wait for help ? Someone has to chance it ... and hike out . That person might not make the road before nightfall . Then what ? I saywe run for it . Split up , take our chances . It 's suicide , Dyer . Fine . You stay here . Tell us how it turns out . ( Panting ) ( Grunting ) ( Labored Breathing ) I think it 's broken . You got to get up . I can 't make it . ( Groaning ) We got to keep moving . ( Grunting ) We 're not going to make it . ( Distant Humming ) ( Humming Growing Louder ) ( Dyer Screaming ) Take a good look , Scully . What am I looking at ? 30 loggers working a clear-cutting contract ... in Washington State- - rugged , manly men ... in the full bloom oftheir manhood . What am I looking for ? Anything strange , unexplainable , unlikely , boyfriend- - I don 't know . I give up , Mulder . Funny . That 's what the Federal Forest Service ... has done as well . Why ? What happened to them ? In a word , theyvanished . Or so it would appear . This is Doug Spinney and Steven Teague . They call themselves " monkeywrenchers . " They drive spikes into trees ... sabotage logging equipment , and make life miserable ... for lumberjacks and lumber mills . Ecoterrorists- - militant environmentalists . Right . Two weeks ago ... the loggers radioed a message ... that Spinney and Teague had gone on a spree ... sabotaging equipment , causing general mischief . One week later ... all radio communication was cut off . Do they know why ? No . The lumber company ... asked the Federal Forest Service to look into it . Two officials went in last week . No one has heard from them . It appears as if these monkeywrenchers ... are doing more than mischiefmaking . That 's what the lumber company and forest service are accusing . They 've asked the FBI to investigate . I had to pull strings to get the case . An ecoterrorism case ? Do I dare askwhy ? In 1 934 , long before anyone knew what an ecoterrorist was ... a WPA crew ... working that same area vanished without a trace . None ofthose men was ever found or heard from again . And you suspect what , Bigfoot ? Not likely . That 's a lot offannel to be choking down ... even for Bigfoot . Come on . It will be a nice trip to the forest . Hi . Fox Mulder , Dana Scully . We 're with the fbi . Larry Moore , Federal Forest Service . You can putyour gear in the truck . Must be pretty rugged where we 're going . Yeah . Is that a bullet hole in yourwindshield ? .22 caliber . Somebody shot atyou ? There 's not much to hunt around here ... with that ammo except Freddies . " Freddies " ? Employees of the Federal Forest Service . It 's what ecoterrorists call us . Is that whoyou think shot atyou ? Let me get this out ofthe way . I have no quarrel with ecoterrorists in principle . I 'm as concerned for this forest ... and the environment as anybody . It 's their methods I can 't condone . Doyou think they 'd kill a man ? There 's 30 men up there unaccounted for ... each with survival experience . Something happened to them . Sorry I 'm late . I was down talking to Bob Perkins ' wife . He 's one ofour missing loggers . Hey , Larry . Steve Humphreys , head ofsecurity ... for Schiff-lmmergut Lumber . Mulder . Scully . We 've got a four-hour drive ahead ofus- - Plenty oftime to get acquainted . Get the impression ... we 've walked into the middle ofa war ... that 's already started ? Why do these men ... work so far up in the wilderness ? That 's where the trees are . You 're kidding , right ? No . Environmentalists have made sure ... that all the land here is untouchable . We take our timber where we can get it . Even then , we plant saplings for every tree we take . So why do ecoterrorists targetyou ? Tree huggers are like the boys ... who went up to Canada during the Vietnam War . They 're cowardly , and so are their tactics . Damn it . Homemade tire spike . Clear through the sidewall . It 's unfixable . You got a spare ? Humphreys : Right tire 's history too . Monkeywrenchers call it a caltrop . Roads back here are littered with them . Indiscriminate terrorism . Can you imagine somebody ... spiking the roads ofWashington , D.C. ? How much sympathy would they get ? So how are we going to get to the camp ? We 're going to have to hike . Anybody here ? Someone forgot to clean their plate . Scully : Looks like they left in a hurry too . They forgot to pack . Find anything ? Party favors . Vehicles have all been monkeywrenched . Power generator 's busted . Somebody really turned this place upside down . Whoever did it didn 't want the fact broadcast , either . Radiators are all full ofrice . Looks like sugar or sand in all the crankcases . They really did a number here . The sun 's going down in an hour and a half . Better look around before it gets dark . I 'll see ifl can get that generatorworking . You were right about one thing . What 's that ? Definitelywasn 't Bigfoot . Look at that . Scully : What is it ? Moore : It looks like a hive . Maybe a cocoon ofsome kind . Made bywhat ? I don 't know . I 've never seen anything like it . Got it . Can you cut it down ? Yeah , I think so . You all right , Scully ? Scully : Oh , God . It feels , uh ... it feels desiccated , hard and dry ... almost preserved . Like it 's been embalmed . No , more like the fuids have been bled ... from its body . Almost like it 's been cured . I think ... it 's a male . Barely . I 'd say it 's some kind ofspider 's nest ... or insect cocoon . What kind ofinsect could have gotten a man ... all the way up into that tree ? Itsy-bitsy spider . ( Creaking ) ( Clanking ) Don 't move . Who areyou ? Doug Spinney . I ought to shootyou . Might as well shootyourselftoo . You 're in a spot to be testing me . What happened to my men ? What men ? The men who were working this camp . I don 't know . Probably the same thing ... will happen to us when the sun goes down . What areyou doing ? This animal 's Doug Spinney . He 's responsible for all the monkeywrenching . He 's probably a murderer . I 'm no murderer . You 're a liar . Let 's hear him out . Ifwe stand around , there will be nothing left to say . Think about getting that generator started . Darkness is our enemy . What 's he talking about ? Someone want to give me a hand ? Now he 's giving orders ? I 'm the one ... who fixed the damn thing . Mulder : It 's all right . Why did you say that darkness was our enemy ? That 's when they come . When who comes ? I don 't know what it is . They come from the sky , take a man right offhis feet ... and devour him alive . I saw it happen . Happen to who ? ( Engine Sputtering ) ( ldling Smoothly ) I need to eat . I haven 't eaten in three days . What kind of B.S. story is that , huh ? You believe that ? We found something in the forest . What ? A man caught in some kind ... ofinsect cocoon . What happened here ? We camped two valleys over , four ofus . Three now . More rats in the woodpile . Our truck has a dead battery . We drew straws to see who would make the hike ... to steal one from the loggers . Why notjust hike out ? It 's over a day 's hike . No waywe wanted to be caught in the forest after dark ... not after what happened to Teague . That 's the man you said was devoured alive ? Yeah . Why areyou out here ? Camping . The kind ofcamping you do is a federal offense . just hold offa second , okay ? No , he 's right . This man is an admitted felon . He could be arrested . What aboutyour offense , my friend , huh ? What aboutyour offense against nature ? We operate within the law . We pay for the right to take those trees . Well , your logging crew is taking trees ... that are marked and protected ... so don 't talk to me about breaking the law ... sir . They 've taken marked trees ? Yes , sir , marked in orange . Old growth trees ? You know anything about that , Steve ? No . You going to take this man 's word ... over mine ? You don 't want to go out in the night . Take myword on that . It 's out there . Ifl go out that door ... something 's going to eat me and spin me in its web ? Yes . It 's too polite to come in here ... and get me ? For some reason , it 's , uh , afraid ofthe light . It 's afraid ofthe light . There may be something to what he 's saying , Steve . He 's a murderer , clever enough to make up a story like that ... even whip up that cocoon to save a few trees ... and I 'm going to prove I 'm right . This is ridiculous . Where is it , Spinney ? I thought it was going to come and devour me . Humphreys : Here I am ! ( Zapping ) Come out , come out , whereveryou are . Aw , don 't be shy . Come on . Huh ? It 'sjust like I told you . There 's nothing out here but a bunch oftrees ... that this man values more than human life . I 'm going to see him tried on murder charges . What doyou think ? I think I 'm going to suggest ... that we sleep with the lights on . ( Sighs ) ( Zapping ) You see this Douglas fir ? It 's been standing here since before time ... and your men cut it down . Scully : Who marks these trees ? Federal Forest Service . You 're only supposed to cut trees ... with a blue X. Mulder : It must be hundreds ofyears old . Scully : Must get a lot oflumber from a tree like this . Thousands ofboard feet . Hell ofa lot easier ... than taking a lot ofsmaller , younger trees . Monkeywrenchers like Spinney here ... are not above marking trees ... with their own paint . This tree 's 500 years old ifit 's a day . Mulder : Look at this . What would this represent ? I don 't know . I 've never seen a ring like that before . Those center rings are older rings , right ? Yeah . Every ring represents a season ofgrowth . And you see these ? These are 500 , 600 years old . They 're a recorded history ofrainfall and climate . But this one , I don 't know . I should take a core sample . We finished with this nature walk ? What happened to those loggers ? We 're determining that . Don 'tyou think ... you should be interrogating this man ? I don 't think he did it . I want him arrested . He 's not leaving . No , not with a gun on him . What happens ifhis three buddies show up ... and do toyou what they did ... to those two federal forest officials ? I just want to take a core sample . I got families who want some answers about loved ones ... answers not found in that tree . The only crime is the death ofthat tree . Yeah , well , we 'll see about that . Whereyou going ? I 'm hiking down toyour truck ... and get some people up here ... who will take action . Steve ! Let him go . Let him find out for himself . This is odd . This yellow ring 's got something living in it ... some kind of ... tiny bug . It doesn 't make sense . Why not ? Well , parasites attack a tree in a variety ofways ... but they always attack the living parts : the leaves , the roots , the new growth rings . Even ifthey 're borers ofsome kind ... theywouldn 't be working so deep in the tree . Maybe the wood in this ring is different . They seem to be feeding on it . Can you identify them ? It 's a wood mite ofsome kind . Could they have been living in that tree for hundreds ofyears ? No . Inner rings are dead wood . The tree 's vascular system ... is limited to the outer few rings . They need water to survive . They appear to be hatching out ofthe wood . Maybe when you drew out this core ... you tapped into a larger nest . Spinney : Can they build a cocoon ? Right after that tree was cut down is when Teague died . It 's about the same time that the loggers disappeared too . You think these mites killed the men ? Maybe they been dormant for hundreds ofyears . Maybe theywoke up hungry . Damn it ! ( Sighs ) ( Humming ) All right , you monkeywrenchers ... come on out now . I know whatyou 're up to ! ( Humming ) ( Horn Honks ) ( Grunting ) ( Screaming ) ( ldling Smoothly ) Humphreys should have been back by now . These bugs aren 't moving anymore . They 're either dead , or they 're asleep . It 's the light . They don 't like the light . Scully : Usually , bugs are attracted to light . Spinney : These obviously are notyour ordinary bugs ... to say the least . Doyou know insects , Scully ? Uh , just what I learned in my biology courses . They 're the foundation ofour ecosystem . There are lots ofthem , something like ... 200 million per person . They 've been around a long time ? Yeah , something like 600 million years- - before the dinosaurs . Why ? This tree is what , 600 , 700 years old ? Yeah . These rings represent a history ofclimatic changes ... which means that , in this year in the life ofthe tree ... there was some strange event that produced an abnormal ring . Like what , exactly ? A volcanic eruption . This whole chain ofmountains ... running from Washington to Oregon is active . Remember Mount St. Helens ? Yeah . How does that explain the bugs ? After Mount St. Helens erupted , there was radiation unleashed ... from inside the Earth . Strange things started to grow . There 's this lake where they discovered an amoeba ... that sucks a man 's brains out . Oh , a brain-sucking amoeba . It 's true . Spirit Lake . There 's documented cases ... ofinfected swimmers . But an amoeba is ... a single-celled organism that can be mutated . An insect is a complex animal . A mutation would takeyears to evolve . Maybe what we 're dealing with isn 't a mutation at all . What ifit 's some kind ofextinct insect larvae ... in that ring- - deposited during volcanic activity ... brought up through the tree 's root system . Ancient insect eggs ... thousands , maybe millions ofyears old ... lying dormant- - Until those loggers cut down that tree . That would be rather poeticjustice , don 'tyou think ... unleashing the very thing that would end up killing them ... and your friend Humphreys ? And who knows ? Maybe us . Sweet dreams . Humphreys might havejust hiked out ofhere . We don 't know that he didn 't . Maybe we 're letting ourselves get carried away ... with this bug story . Yeah , maybe . ( ldling Smoothly ) Mulder : Going somewhere ? No , I was- - Doing auto repair ? You 're planning on cutting out . My friends only had enough gas ... to keep their generator running 20 hours . They 'll die ifl don 't get back . Why sneak around ? The forest service guy wouldn 't go for it . He 'd never trust me . He 's got no reason to . Neither do I . I can save us all . We 've got aJeep . It 'sjust two valleys over . It needs a battery . I can be back in the morning . We can all drive out tomorrow . You got to trust me , man . Mulder : Radio 's back up . It 's working ? I 'm not getting any reception ... so the receiver could be trashed . What about transmissions ? Can you send a message ? I could try . This is a call for help . Is there anyone at this frequency ? This is Special Agent Mulder ofthe fbi . We have an emergency and a possible quarantine . Our position is- - ( Generator Dies ) What happened to the generator ? I turned it off . Turn it back on . The radio 's working . Where 's the gas can ? Spinney took it . He took it ? You mean he 's gone ? He left earlier . He took a battery and gas . He 's coming back . He gave his personal guarantee ? He gave me his word , yeah . The man who gaveyou his word has made an art out ofsabotage ... and defying authority , and is probably the man ... who put that bullet through mywindshield . What would you have done ? We 've got one chance , which is one more than we had . Or one less . What doyou mean ? He let Spinney take the last ofthe gas . This generator 's got about a quarter tank left . What about the trucks ? The tanks have been ruptured or filled with sugar . By the man we are trusting to come back for us . We got to get on the radio and send a Mayday . Every drop offuel ... is going to keep this gennie powered tonight . I don 't want to wait ... hoping somebody heard that transmission ... when this thing quits running about 2 : 00 in the morning . Doyou ? ( Sighs ) ( Groans ) Mulder- - It 's done . I shouldn 't have let him go . Let 'sjust move past it , okay ? Fine . What doyou suggest ? I don 't know . We 'll think ofsomething . I thinkwe both have a good idea ... ofwhat happened to those loggers ... and what happened to the group in 1 934 . They only found one cocoon . It 's a big forest . What would you have done ? Would I have made a decision myself that affected us all ? Cut the sanctimonious crap . What doyou want me to say ? We might die up here . Ifwe 're lucky , they 'll find our bodies spun up in a tree ... or they may not find us at all ! You 're right , and we 're wasting time arguing about it . What areyou going to do ? Button this place up . Ifwe got to spend the night in here ... we got to do everything we can ... to make sure the bugs stay out there . I 'd be careful with that . It 's the only bulb that works . ( ldling Roughly ) I can see them . You guys , look at this . Look . They 're coming through the wall ... down where it 's dark . You see them ? ( Gasps Softly ) They 're on me ! Mulder : It 's all right . Scully , Scully- - Get them offme ! Whoa ! Watch it ! Stand still ! Stop it ! Can you see them ? Get them off ! . They 're notjust on you . They 're everywhere . That 's what that residue is over everything . I thought we were safe in the light ! We are ! I think the light keeps them from swarming . We 'll be safe as long as we stay in the light . ( ldling Smoothly ) Howyou feeling ? I 'm okay . They 're oxidizing enzymes ... just like firefies . Maybe that 's why they cocoon their prey- - so that they can oxidize the proteins ... taken from the fuids in the body . What ifthe generator goes ? Will they swarm in here and drain the life out ofus ? We got an hour and a half till sunrise . Then what ? It 's over a day 's hike out ofhere . We won 't make it on foot by nightfall . Maybe somebody heard our transmission . Help could be on the way . You sent that call hours ago . I mean , help would have been here by now . Well , I 'm not going to give up on Spinney . He gave me his word he 'd come back to get us . And ifhe doesn 't ? We 'll think ofsomething . ( ldling Roughly ) ( Generator Sputtering ) ( Sputtering increases ) ( Generator Dies ) You got a patch kit in your truck ? Yeah . Maybe we can patch this or get it to hold air . With the truck 's spare , maybe we can limp down the mountain . Ifnot , we can get on the radio and warn them what 's out here . ( Thunder Rumbling ) Moore : See it ? Mulder : Yeah . ( Low Humming ) Listen . You hear that ? Moore : It 's a car . No . It 's aJeep . We got to move . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Wait ! What about the body- - Humphreys ' body ? Leave it . I 've radioed for help . Where areyour friends ? They didn 't make it . We won 't either ... unless we haul ass . Let 's go . Come on . Spinney : Oh ! Damn it ! Moore : I don 't believe it . You talk about shooting yourselfin the foot . ( Yelling ) Get out ofthere ! Get in the car ! ( Yelling ) ( Groaning ) ( Screaming ) We have an emergency evacuation situation . Requesting quarantine facility for two ... possibly three victims ... with undiagnosed infection or exposure ... to unknown biological vectors . Repeat , that 's an emergency evacuation situation . Two , possibly three victims- - How areyou feeling ? Better . How did the tests come back ? Your respiratory charts were good . We were concerned ... about the damage due to inhalation . There were large concentrations ... ofthe chemical we determined was luciferin . Which is what ? The same enzyme we find in firefies ... and other bioluminescent insects . Our entomologists are still trying to determine ... the specific epithet ... ofthe insects you encountered . Scully ? How 's she doing ? She 's still not out of the woods , so to speak . She lost a lot offuids . Two or three more hours ofexposure ... she might not have made it . I told her it was going to be a nice trip to the forest . Howyou going to contain it to the forest ? What ifthe swarm migrates ? The government has initiated eradication procedures . They 're quite certain that , by using a combination ofcontrolled burns and pesticides ... theywill be successful . And ifthey 're not ? That is not an option , Mr. Mulder . Imade this !

 The heat wave continues . It 's 109 degrees in Los angeles . As drought-ridden Los angeles sweIters in agonising heat , drug lords wage warfare in the streets . Yet another open conflict ... Oh , fuck this ! Get me out of here ! We 're in a war zone , Dave : two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire , the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate , heroic attempts . It 's completely out of control down here . My beautiful cantina , everything I own , they shot it to pieces . My microwave , my automatic steamer , my grill ... You fucking ipendejos ! Fuck you ! Tony Pope , live with Hard Core , on the scene and in your face . It 's like Dante 's hell here . Smoke , fire , oppressive heat , as CoIombian and Jamaican drug fiends again transform LA into a slaughterhouse . Who the hell 's in charge down here ? The cops ? Uh-uh . They 're outmanned , outgunned and incompetent . Mr Mayor , on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe , get off your butt , get down here and declare martial law ! OK , don 't keep me in suspense , Danny boy ! It has not been a nice day ! Two motors pulled over a truck , stumbled right in the middle of a narc stakeout . You know , ten CoIombians and Scorpios armed to fuck all . They want to get in their headquarters . We 're keeping them pinned down , but those officers are bleeding to death . Fuck ! They 're dying , man . Where the hell is special Weapons ? They 're still tied up in that shootout in San Pedro with the Jamaicans . They shot down a chopper . mills and Johnson won 't last much longer . We need an assault vehicle to go get ' em . I 'm gonna chat with these assholes . - When I give the signal , give me some cover ! - Got it ! Too small . Right . Come on ! Come on ! Get ' em out of here ! Now ! Get ' em out ! Get ' em out ! Hey , assholes ! Mike , are you OK ? - Yeah . Let 's get the rest . - We can 't . Orders from Chief Heinemann . He says , " Surround building and wait . " - Wait for what ? - I don 't know ! Some bullshit special unit . The feds , the DEA . If we let those bastards get dug in now , we 'II have to level the building ! Come and get it . EI Scorpio is ready . - Sarge , any of your people in the building ? - No . Let 's go . Lieutenant , can 't let you in . Heinemann 's on his way . Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass ! Come on ! Goddamn it . Go with him . Three , two , one ... Go ! Get back . Next door over . Take this room ! First floor , officer down . We need backup . Freeze ! I said hold it ! Lay your guns down . It 's over . You can walk down or fly , it 's your choice . I said put it down , asshole ! No ! - Let 's do it now ! - Take it easy . Damn , it 's hot . Must be losing it . Mike ! Spread out . Secure the roof . Just take it easy . I 'm right here . AII clear . AII clear on the site . Oh , Danny boy . I gotta get down from here . Shit . OK , search the roof . Check every floor . Maybe someone else ... seal it off . No one leaves . Danny , get me off this damn roof . - You get the rest of them ? - Somebody beat us to it . Leona . Oh , shit . - What happened to EI Scorpio ? - He 's out front having lunch . What the hell is this ? I don 't know . They 've been cut to pieces . - Must be the Jamaicans . - Their style , but where the hell did they go ? OK , nobody gets in here until Forensic arrives . Nobody . OK , you know the drill . Mike . Up there . He must have been killed out here , and then someone ... That 's about 35 , 40 feet . No rope , no ladder . The guy weighs about 190 , 195 pounds . You couldn 't carry him up there . Lieutenant ? Deputy Chief Heinemann 's downstairs . He wants you out of the building now . Son of a bitch . What the fuck is going on ? This is not good , Mike . Not good at all . - I want a real name on this joker , OK ? - You got it . Mike . phil , this is quite a surprise . What brings you down from the palace ? You let me down , Mike . You 're making me look bad . I thought we had an understanding . I put my ass on the line to get you here , and all I expect is a little cooperation ! You were told this was a federal matter . Yet you disobeyed an order to stay out of the building . Don 't let this get out , phil , but it 's a fucking war down here . You 're a soldier and you take orders . Don 't push it ! I 'II push it as far as I can , phil , cos we 're fighting for our lives here , while you 're downtown pushing pencils and kissing ass ! I don 't roll over for anybody , especially the feds , without a goddamn good explanation ! Take this equipment up to the third floor . Come on , Iet 's move ! - Let 's go . - Excuse me , sir ! What the hell is going on here , Heinemann ? Insubordination . Disregard for direct orders from a supervising officer . Now get back to your cage at AIvarado . - I 'II show you insubordination , you son of ... - No ! Where you running to ? Come here ! You don 't need this , Mike . It 's not worth it . relax . Oh , fuck ! I have an update for you . In a shootout , five members of one CoIombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals , the Jamaican Voodoo Posse , who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of ... A detective is here to see you . Back there . Listen , lady , you got a backed-up toilet . call a plumber , not the cops . - This licence has expired . - bullshit ! I paid that fee six months ago . - I 'II kick your ass ! - Sit down ! Right now ! - Move ! Get your ass movin ' ! - Just calm the fuck down ! What you lookin ' at ? And all you got to do is tee it high and let it fly . Dead solid perfect . Now , remember , for distance you gotta gently but firmly grip the club . Lieutenant Harrigan ! Detective Lambert , Rampart Division . Hey , kid , just have a seat . I 'II be right with you . - Hey , Cap . - Don 't start , Mike . Heinemann 's been up my ass so far I won 't be able to sit down for a week . We 're not winning this war . As much as it pisses you off , you have to play the game . " Effective immediately , a federal task force under special Agent Peter Keyes will investigate criminal activities involving the trafficking of controlled substances . " And you will extend him your full cooperation . So you 're cutting off my dick and shoving it up my ass . The feds are calling the shots on this . My hands are tied ! - Yeah ? - Captain pilgrim , Peter Keyes . - It 's good to meet you . - And you , sir . Lieutenant Mike Harrigan . special Agent Peter Keyes , DEA . Heard a Iot about you . I 'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion . Don 't mean to be stepping on your toes . But we want to prevent King WiIIie 's voodoo gangs from taking over the entire West Coast . I wish I couId tell you more . But we have a Iarge number of deep-cover operatives involved . You know how it is . We all have ajob to do . Now , I 'm sure we can respect each other 's situation and act responsibly . well ... Cooperation is my middle name . I 'II see you around . - I 'm the new transfer , Jerry Lambert . - Like I said , have a seat . I 'II be right with you . - Who is this dude ? - Yeah , what an asshole . AII right , Danny boy , what we got ? What have we got ? Five IowIife Scorpions make it into the building . The next minute they 're all shish kebab . Not one bullet wound . It wasn 't drugs or money . There 's a shitload of that . Maybe King WiIIie brought in some outside talent . He 's making his big move . A pro would have split the moment he heard us . More than one , we would have seen them . Whoever did this waited until the Iast minute , and then took out four men armed with machine guns by hand ! And then got by us . Maybe we should give him ajob . Let 's put him on the payroll . So me and my partner bolt up the stairs , somebody is screaming bloody murder ... - You gotta hear this . - What ? Hey , I forgot to tell you . See that guy there ? That 's Ferris 's replacement . This guy 's Jerry Lambert . The Lone Ranger from Rampart station . That 's the Lone Ranger ? I thought he was here to fix the air conditioning . I said , " Lady , you are under arrest . " And she said , " Why ? " I said , " Because your husband is dead . You killed him . " - Know what she said , didn 't miss a beat ? - No . She said , " I stabbed that son of a bitch plenty of times . He never died on me before . " Looks like he 's putting the moves to Leona . His first big mistake . - I have heard about you . - Yeah ? - Like , your last partner got shot . - What ? well ... You try that cowboy shit with me , fucker , you can kiss these goodbye . - Got it ? - Yeah , I got it . well , well , I see that the three of you have met . Lambert , if you 're feeling up to it , why don 't you limp your way in to the lieutenant ? He wants to talk to you . Yeah . - You 're a bad girl . - I Iike that . Goddamn , is that bitch on the rag or what ? This is what I call " the speech " , kid . I only give it once , so pay attention . until now , it 's all been fun and games , cops and robbers , dunking doughnuts . But you 're in the shit now . Metro Command is a war zone . Lieutenant , I 've paid my dues . I had to bust my ass to get my transfer . That scares the shit out of me , kid . No one requests to come here unless they want a reputation . There 's no room for anyone looking to prove themselves . I won 't stand for it . Don 't get me wrong . We need good cops , and they say you 're good at what you do . But the team comes first . You live by that , and you 'II be OK . And we 'II all be there for you . Remember , the door swings both ways . That 's it . Hey , kid . welcome to the war . OK , guys . This has gone too far now , huh ? Hey , guys . I know you 're trying to scare me , huh ? well , you did a pretty good job , man . I 'm scared now . You can stop it now . I can pay you . $ 2 million , man . In cash . Right now ! This is not about money . This is about power ! There 's a new king in the streets . This is the message he has for your people . You are history . Fucking history , goddamn puto . What the fuck are you doing now , man ? You 're crazy ! King WiIIie says , not only do I have to kill you , but I have to take your soul . Voodoo magic . Fucking voodoo magic , man . But you know what ? I tell you what I believe . Shit happens . Shoot it ! Fucker ! Shit happens . I 'm standing just outside a penthouse complex in San Pedro ... .. involving as many as 20 people . It 's uncertain who they were . One report indicates it might be the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse . I go in for my physical and the doctor says , " I need a semen , stool and urine sample . " I say , " Gee , doc , I 'm in a big hurry . Can I just leave my underwear ? " Oh , God . Word is there may be as many as 50 more dead bodies up there . Oh , man , it 's Pope . That parasite must live in his car . I 'II handle it . PR 's my specialty . Feds sent word they want your ass off the job . - Tony ! - Who the hell are you ? Your biggest fan ! Catch your show all the time . - I got ajob to do ! - Yourjob is to root for garbage elsewhere . - Been inside ? - Yeah . We were gonna go in with our guys , but we were told on a radio transmission nobody goes in under any circumstances . AII units , be advised . federal officers will handle investigation . - We didn 't hear that . Let 's go . - You 're the boss . This is cheryl Tyer reporting live ... Hey , nice flashlight . Mind if I borrow it ? OK . Damn ! Look familiar ? Fuck . Oh , God . Ramón Vega , the crack king . Biggest operator in East LA . 100 keys a week . - Why isn 't he skinned ? And who are they ? - Jamaicans . King WiIIie 's boys . That makes no sense . This was a voodoo ritual . I 've seen it before . They took his heart out . - What for ? - Terror tactics , man . To scare the shit out of their enemies . - King WiIIie . - Who the hell is King WiIIie ? King WiIIie , voodoo priest of the LA posses . Ran the terror gangs for Edward Seaga in Jamaica till he got too powerful . The Jamaican chiefs won 't make a move without his approval . So what the fuck happened ? Shit ! Hey , we got a survivor ! What 's she saying ? I don 't know . She 's not making any sense . She keeps saying , " El diablo vino por ellos . " The devil came for them . If it 's the CoIombians , why 'd they leave their boss hanging and his girl naked on the floor ? - It wasn 't the CoIombians . - Our friend from the armoury . Right . We got a new player in town . Come over here , Mike . Check this out . What is that ? Looks like a spear tip or something . This is a restricted area . I want it cleared immediately . You 're walking on physical evidence . - We 'II take care of her . - She 's with me . Lieutenant , I 'd Iike a word with you in private , please . They say that persistence is your most outstanding quality . - I know this is your show ... - You 're not listening to me ! You got a big nose and you 're sticking it too far in my business . Maybe you can hear this . The next time you cross me , you 're gonna turn up missing . - Garber , the man with the camera . Get him . - Yes , sir . - AII right . Let 's go . - Stay away . - Hey , fuck you , man ! Give me my camera ! - Shut the fuck up . Hey , wait a minute ! I got my rights ! I 'm ajournaIist . - Harrigan ! - Shut up . Let 's go . smells like a cover-up . The press has a right to know ! Take him out of the building . Search him . Now , you get the hell out of here . Who the hell are you , Keyes ? The last person in the world you wanna fuck with . Wanna make me proud , kid ? Take your bag of tricks , stay with them , find out where they take her . Meet me later at La Cita 's . And be careful . These guys are good . Hey , don 't worry ! surveillance is my specialty . OK , then . Just get going . Go get ' em , Lone Ranger . Danny , look here . We gotta take this real cool . These guys sure aren 't the DEA , but it 's still Keyes 's party . You stick around , stay out of sight . I 'II meet you at one o 'cIock . We 'II take a good look at that room , OK ? Hey , wait for me . Danny boy , no hero stuff , understand ? Watch your ass , Danny boy . She never made it . The feds were waiting . HustIed her off in a chopper . - Let me guess . A silver AIouette ? - The very one . Guess what . Your pal Keyes was running the whole show . And his butt boys . Son of a bitch . You done real good , kid . Now tomorrow , start a tall on Keyes . Everything he does , everywhere he goes . Who knows ? You mightjust get lucky . Lieutenant ! Luck is my specialty . Yeah . I bet it is . Now , if you 'II excuse me , Lieutenant , I got some serious police work to attend to . Come to Papa . Hey ! - Hey , are your balls OK ? - Fine . How are yours ? - Hey , do you mind ? It 's my sister . - Say what ? Oh , you 're not my sister . Son of a bitch . Who are you really chasing , Keyes ? Time to go to work . - Shit . - Danny boy . Mike ? Oh , God ! Oh , Mother of God ! please , no ! Lieutenant michael R Harrigan : violence prone , obsessive / compulsive personality , a history of excessive physical force throughout his 18 years as a Los angeles police officer . also responsible for the destruction of 11 patrol cars , a city bus ... What about ten commendations for valour and the best felony arrest record in the history of this department ? That and my intervention on your behalf are the only reasons you have ajob , Harrigan . If it were up to the chief , he 'd charge you with Detective ArchuIeta 's death and suspend you . As it is , he left it in my hands . Now , this John Wayne attitude and flagrant disregard for policy is gonna end now . No one under my command will impede the progress of this federal task force headed by Agent Keyes . No one . That 's it . Dismissed . Mike , you 're too close to this . Stay out of it . It 's a police matter . They can 't keep the department out of it . We 'II find Danny 's killer . Captain , Danny and I came up together . 15 years on the fucking street ! Whoever killed him 's gonna pay . I 'm gonna finish it . Hey , come on . What is this ? Listen , shithead . I don 't give a fuck what you want with this asshole because now it 's personal . And he 's a dead man . What you 're dealing with is over your head . I 'm warning you ... You ! You don 't know what you 're dealing with . And I 'm warning you . Stay the fuck out of my way ! - I 'II take care of him . - No . Let him go . We 're too close . .. claiming as his , turf controlled by the Jamaican and colombian drug lords . Watch as we continue our report . Yes , the word is out : LA is up for grabs , the spoils of our once-fine city going to the ruthless scum who can spread the most carnage and blood in our streets . The latest update on the scoreboard : five assorted trash and one good cop - one of the best on our force . Who 's next ? Where 's the mayor ? He 's not even in the city ... Forget it . It 's over . Mike , goddamn it . This ain 't your personal little war , you know . I Ioved Danny , too . Hey , you told me the only way you survive is because you 're a team . The door swings both ways . Remember ? AII right . We 'II do it together . Come on . talk to me about Keyes . - We 've been on him for the Iast three days . - They 're not looking for drug dealers . Yeah . They 've been setting up weird radar sensors all over downtown . I used my whole repertory to keep up with them ! I had scanners on them , but they scrambled my shit up . They had equipment I can 't begin to touch . And then this morning ... - I lost ' em . - We lost them . - Where ? - Vernon and Industry . - They disappeared ! - The slaughterhouse district ? Yeah , and in this heat ... I mean , BO and barbecue ! Whatever Keyes is looking for , he 's found it , or close to it . Leona , I want to meet with King WiIIie . willie and I seem to have the same problem . - In the meantime , you come with me . - Mike , it 's impossible ! Just do it . Fuck ! Omega 1 . This is control . This is Omega 1 . We only have 22 minutes on safe window of operation . - Yes , sir . - Verify that final telemetry check . Start your test now . Scan track . Three , two , one , mark . Number six , power up on the UV banks . We 're complete on the lower UV banks . Ready for testing . Second level , check for ambient temperature variations . You got two minutes . Now get going . To all units . AII units , you have approximately 20 minutes to finish your task . - Roger . - Increase this UV . Up 42 per cent . Your friend died as the result of an intrusion in the chest cavity by an edged weapon that nearly cleaved the heart in two . Death was instantaneous . He was boned like a fish . I 've never seen anything like this . please , do not touch anything . Doctor , what about the other victims ? Anything there ? The federal team brought in their own forensic examiners . I am the medical examiner and the chief pathologist in the city , and they 've cut me out . Any way you can get a look at evidence the feds have collected ? - I mean , they must have run tests . - It won 't be easy . Doctor , I pried this from Danny 's hands . This is what took him into the rafters . - It has almost no weight . - But it cuts like steel . Let me see . We are now at 150,000 times normal magnification . Astonishing . This material doesn 't correspond to anything on the periodic table . - Lieutenant , what is that thing ? - I don 't know . It 's not from a hardware store . - military ? - Good guess . Either something that got away , or something they want . Keyes . Ah , we 're getting closer now to what happened ... Hey , no ! Easy , kid . Put your gun away . King WiIIie will see you now . - It 's OK . - Don 't you want me to go with you ? I 'II call you later . - You want me to follow you ? - I 'II call you later . You want some ganja , man ? License plate number . 1-8-8 ... No , no . 1-8-8-3 ... Oh , fuck ! The door swings both ways , my ass . This door swings both ways . Thanks for the ride . You know , you guys really ought to cut down . They say you want to talk to me . They say you offering me favours . tell me why , babylon . Mr policeman . - I want some information . - Information . About the one that 's doing all the killing ? He killed your people . Now mine . I think you know who he is . I want him . I don 't know who he is . But I know where he is . - The other side . - What are you talking about ? The spirit world , man . You see , it 's always the same . There 's no stopping what can 't be stopped . No killing what can 't be killed . Make sense , man . This thing that 's killing your people and mine is from the other side . I can feel him all around . You can 't see the eyes of the demon until him come calling . This is dread , man . truly dread . Nothing else for you here , policeman . Time to go . Prepare yourself . " His foundation lie in the holy mountain . " " SeIah . " This is Tony Pope live from LA - the city of fear . The psycho-vigiIante killer continues his daily diet for murder . Bodies strung out , bodies with the skins ripped off , the hearts torn from the cadavers . And just recently , King WiIIie , the drug lord , the vicious drug lord , found in an alley just around the corner with his head cut off and his spinal column torn from the body . A fitting demise to the Prince of Powder . First Danny , then King WiIIie . And you were right there ! He 's playing with you , Mike . You 've gotta be careful . Yeah . We all gotta be careful . What about Keyes ? - Anything there ? - definitely something slippery about Keyes . Seems there 's a Peter J Keyes . PhD physical sciences , cornell . Hot out of college and into the Strategic Defense Institute . Then two years later commissioned as a captain in Air Force intelligence . Mike , this is a dead end . We 're way out of our league ! Look , I don 't care who 's involved . This guy killed Danny and he 's going to fall ! - What about the good doctor ? - I 'm here , Lieutenant . The federal authorities erased everything from the computer file except for this : part of a chemical test on a fragment of wood from the penthouse . And it contained traces of cattle blood and heavy traces of steroids . I believe whoever killed Detective ArchuIeta had recently been in a slaughterhouse . - That 's where I lost Keyes the first time ! - That 's where we 'II find him . Take the metro . I 'II pick you up at Vernon station in an hour . If you don 't see Keyes 's boys , it doesn 't mean they 're not around . I just want you to stay in the car . OK ? Your mom and I won 't be very long . You sit still . We 'II be back in a few minutes . AII right ? - Come on , honey . - Yes , darling . - Which way was it ? - Down here . Take that , you scum-sucking dog . Want some candy ? Brian ? - You come here right this minute ! - Mommy , I saw a ghost . Want some candy ? Rest . Want some candy ? Danny 's necklace . I hate the subway at rush hour . It 's hard enough to find a seat , and if you do someone 's pissed in it or thrown up over it . This damn heat is killing me , man . Hey , it 's me ! - I Iook great ! - Oh , shut up . No autographs , Pop . - Look . There 's two seats right there . - Don 't touch me ! Hey ! Get off ! This shit never ends . - After you . - asshole ! - Excuse me . police business . - Get out of my way ! Hey , baby . Bésame mucho . Come on ! You look like a sympathetic dude . My ... partner here needs an operation . But we 're a little short of cash , if you know what I mean ? No need for that . Money ! Get the hell away from me ! I know how to use this ! - Don 't make me use this thing ! - Bet mine 's bigger than yours ! I 'II take that . - hold it . police ! - We 're in trouble now . Nobody move ! Everybody take a deep breath , loosen your sphincters . We don 't need any rush-hour Rambos there . Tú también , motherfucking baby ! Drop it and sit down ! iSiéntate ! What the hell is that ? Leona , you OK ? This is it ! He 's in the train ! Get these people out of here ! Jerry ! What 's happening ? Get down ! Get out of the way ! Jerry ! Leona ! Leona , get ' em out ! Go ! Now ! Jerry ! Leona , do it ! Now ! Hey ! Over here ! Yeah , that 's right . Come and get it . Come on ! Move it ! Let 's go ! iVamos ! Move it ! Don 't panic , just go ! Go ! iVamos ! Jesus Christ . What the fuck are you ? Wait ! iVamos ! Come on ! Keep walking ! Come on , you too ! iVámonos ! Come on , motherfucker ! Want some candy ? Let 's dance ! Come on , get out of the way ! Come on , out ! Come on , move it ! That way ! Towards the light ! Come on ! Get out ! Oh , God . Jerry . God , not again . Move your ass ! Move out the way ! - What 's happening ? - It 's a fucking slaughter , Lieutenant . Hey , Jerry ! Leona ! Oh , please . Leona ... - How 's she doing ? - Deep shock , but she 's alive . I hear foetaI heart sounds . She 's pregnant . Let 's move . LA County . Stat ! Stand back . On three . One , two , three . Load up . Out of my way ! Move out the way ! Move it ! Man ! Wait a minute . Let me see . - Where 's Jerry ? - I don 't know . We found his badge . Who got hit this time ? Five gang members , bunch of commuters . Doesn 't make sense . They were all armed . - What do you mean ? - It 's the chief . Wait here . - What the hell 's going on down there ? - It 's a damn nightmare . civilians this time . - AII killed ? - Yeah . Just like the others . Damn ! Jerry ! holy shit ! What the hell is going on here ? Hey , guys , get the camera on ! Get the camera on this right now ! Get that goddamn thing on film ! What 's going on ? Hey , Harrigan ! More victims ! More mutiIations ! Fuck you ! Pope ? Are you there , Pope ? Pope , what 's going on ? - Sir , the cop is back . - Goddamn . Harrigan ! Don 't you show up in the damnedest places . Come here , Lieutenant . I got something you might find interesting . What is this ? How many times do I have to tell you ? You don 't know what you 're dealing with . There 's your killer . wonderful , isn 't it ? Pheromone signature left by his body . Scent molecules . Punch up three . Ten years ago one of his kind eliminated an elite special Forces crew in central America . There were two survivors . They indicated that , when trapped , the creature activated a seIf-destruct device that destroyed enough rainforest to cover 300 city blocks . remarkable weaponry . That 's right , Lieutenant . Other-worId life forms . A fucking alien ! Iwo Jima , Cambodia , Beirut . Drawn by heat and conflict . He 's on safari . Lions . The tigers . The bears . Oh , my ! Trophies . That 's the game , isn 't it , Keyes ? You 're the lion . This is his jungle . - So why can 't we see him ? - Defensive adaptations are astounding . It 's somehow able to bend light . Perfect camouflage . - You admire the son of a bitch . - Not what he does . For what he is . For what he can give us . A new era of scientific technology . I 've waited a lifetime for this , and I 'm not going to miss the chance . Mr Garber , we have something on the pheromone scanners . - Target one is on the roof . - It 's taken us two weeks to Iearn his patterns . He comes here every two days to feed . - Seems he has a taste for beef . - I didn 't think he was vegetarian . well , we 've prepared a trap for this predator . We are certain that this being can see in only one spectrum of light . - Infrared . - Infrared ? - He hunts by seeing our heat . - block the heat and he 's blind . These suits insulate body heat , making the team invisible . We 've flooded the place with radioactive dust and installed powerful ultraviolet lighting everywhere . The dust adheres to his body , making him visible . Liquid nitrogen . You 're not gonna kill him . You 're gonna freeze him . - We have to capture him . - He 's moving . finally . Grab a seat . Enjoy the show . This is history . Capture and isolation is our objective . Defensive action only on my orders . Power up . Lights on . Let 's get him ! We 're in . Switch to ultraviolet . - Radio silence . Out . - Engage ultraviolet units A through J. - What 's all this interference ? - Correcting the problem , sir . They 're moving to the second level . Target 's still moving , heading towards the number two stairwell . playing right into it . Wait a minute . It 's stopped . It 's moving back against the wall . It 's backing up . It 's moving away from them . Your boys have been made . - Sir , it 's circling around behind them . - Get ' em out ! They 're walking into a trap ! Keyes , he 's behind you . Third floor structure . Right there ! Who is this ? clear the line . He sees the damn lights . Turn ' em off ! Shit ! Stop him ! - Door . Open it . - Go fuck yourself . OK . OK . The door . - Yes , sir . - You don 't know what you 're doing . - It 's open . - You 'II ruin everything ! Fuck yourself ! Defensive formation one . Nitrogen guns , safeties off . Everyone else , rock 'n'roII . This is it . He 's moving down from the right . Garber , where is he ? I can 't see him . He 's right there ! Goddamn it ! Where is he ? Give me a coordinate ! Where is he ? - Watch out ! - My God . Watch your crossfire ! Damn ! The line - I 'm losing my pressure . Keyes , you all right ? Keyes , it 's over here ! Come on ! Switch over ! Shit ! I can 't see ! They 're gone . They 're all dead . You want me ? Here I am ! You are one ugly mother ... Motherfucker ! Guess who 's back . Too late to go home now . Get out of here , Harrigan . I 'm gonna save your ass . This is between me and him ! God ... Birds . Damn birds . OK , pussyface . It 's your move . Shit happens . Oh , God . That 's all I need is birds . You can do it . I can do it . It 's like falling off a log . Like a 30-storey log . Damn ! Maybe I 'II get lucky and fall . Damn it . The final Jeopardy answer is this : Berengaria , who never set foot in england , was its queen for eight years after marrying this king on Cyprus . Good luck . Herb ? Herb , wake up !

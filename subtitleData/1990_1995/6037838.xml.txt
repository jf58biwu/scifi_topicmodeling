 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ man ] Traffic 's backed up on the northbound expressway . All other routes are moving along nicely . The current temperature 's an even 70 . It looks like another beautiful day , Capital City . And now it 's time for America 's number one syndicated talk show , the Judy Hour . And here 's your host , Judy Donatello ! Thank you , Bob . I am so excited . Today is our first day on our new satellite system and have we got a show for you . It 's all about bizarre relationships . Now I 'm not talking about opposites attracting or anything quite as simple as that , I 'm talking about full out bizarre relationships . I 'd like you to meet our first couple . They met four years ago when Chris arrested Mike for aggravated assault . Lex , check this out . Bizarre relationships . Doesn 't that hit close to home ? Will you shut up ? I 'm trying to think . You know , that 's all you ever do anymore . I 'm trying to figure out ways to get ride of Superboy so we don 't have to spend the rest of our lives hiding like cockroaches . As long as we 're together . Well , I guess it pays to have a good lawyer now , doesn 't it ? - [ screaming ] - [ clamoring ] They met in a way that was really ... there 's no other word for it . Bizarre . [ clamoring ] - You called Bizarro ? - [ screaming ] No , no , no , please , no . Please , Bizarro , don 't ! You say Bizarro ? No , bizarre relationships . That 's what I said . That what I want . A relationship ? You want a relationship ? Bizarro want someone to love . Lex , I know you told me to shut up , but look at this . What , that inane talk show ... Nobody love Bizarro . Hold the phone . That 's Bizarro . Me only want someone to love . Someone to love . [ laughing ] This guy is beautiful . You must be joking . Whoever falls for this guy would have to be as ugly as he is . You know , darling , you may not be as dumb as you look . But hopefully , he is . [ laughing ] [ man ] Come in . Come in ! Those articles on ... Mr. Jackson . Mr. Jackson . My paycheck . I know it 's here . Somewhere , probably have $ 1,000 down here by now . Those articles on the Bigfoot sighting , I distributed them . You 've been an intern here for what , two weeks ? It 's clear to me you have mastered the fine art of copying . Now the big question is how are you at filing ? OK , I guess , but I was really hoping ... Later for that . Right now what I need is for you to help me find a report on cattle mutilations . This one ? For God 's sake , how 'd you find it ? Archaeology 's my minor . [ telephone rings ] [ woman ] Mr. Jackson , your new intern is here . Kent , go get her , bring her in here . New intern , sir ? Is there something wrong with the work I 've been doing ? Kent , would you look at this stuff ? There is enough work here for a battalion of interns . Mr. Jackson . He 's right in there . Good luck . Thanks , but I won 't need any . Hey , Clark . Surprised to see me ? Well , yeah , but all of the places to take your internship , why the Bureau ? Because of what you do here . You mean filing , copying , getting coffee . No way . I 'm not doing any of that . See , this place has all the answers about UFOs , psychic phenomenon , monsters . - I really haven 't ... - And maybe even Superboy . Superboy . Yeah , what could be more extra normal than him ? Wouldn 't you like to know more about it ? I would . So would I. [ telephone rings ] Hello . Bureau for Extra Normal Matters . Ritter speaking . What ? You gotta be kidding . On the Judy Show ? So if you 're here for action and adventure , forget it . You 're an intern . You 're not an agent . You get coffee . You cover reports and you stay out of our hair . You know , the Bureau has every high tech gadget you could want , except a lousy cable connection . If you 'd open your eyes . Lang , this is Matt Ritter , one of the Bureau 's finest field agents . We 've already met . Dennis , you should see this . [ grunting ] Oh , my God . It 's that thing they created at Schuster University . An imperfect copy of Superboy . The file said it left earth . Evidently , he 's back . Bizarro need someone . Bizarro , what are you doing here ? Everyone has someone to love . Everyone but Bizarro . Easy , Bizarro . Easy . Remember me ? I 'm your friend . Bizarro has no friend . Somebody 's gonna get hurt . Me hurt . You picked a heck of a time to take a lunch break . The phones haven 't stopped ringing since that Bizarro clown did his guest shot on the Judy Show . Have there been sightings ? No , but you got other things to worry about , like the phones . I went to Schuster to pick up the duplicator . It 's not there . Stolen ? Gotta be . Hold on . Artie , stay with it . You , man the phones . You got more important things to do ? No , I guess not . Well , that 's 12 of them . That oughta do it . I just don 't get it , Lex . Why bizarro pigeons ? They 're bizarro homing pigeons . I 'll give you a hint . Birds of a feather ... Flock together . Ahh . Lex , I think it worked . Bizarro ! Well , I see you must have caught up with one of my winged messengers ? Pretty birds make me sad . Other birds stay away from them . Why you make birds , to make Bizarro sad ? No , no , no , no . I made them so that I could find you so that I could make you happy . You make Bizarro happy ? If you make me happy . How me make you happy ? It 's simple . Kill Superboy . Why you want me kill Superboy ? He do nothing to Bizarro . He do nothing to Bizarro ? Have you looked at yourself lately ? He made you look like that . - No . - Yes , he was jealous . He knew that an exact replica would be too much competition . So he made you look , well ... Ugly ? It 's a strong , but if you think it fits . Me ugly . That why Bizarro am lonely . All the awards , the testimonial dinners . He didn 't wanna share all that , and the women . He certainly didn 't wanna share the women . Superboy ? You 're as good as he is . You 're better . You 're gifted . You 're unique . Most people have to work at it , but Superboy had everything handed to him on a silver platter . Now you tell me what 's most important . Good looks or character ? But how killing Superboy get me someone to love ? As soon as he 's dead , I 'm going to make someone just for you . See ? You make me happy , I make you happy . You make Bizarro happy ? Yes , yes . Now there 's just one small problem . We 're gonna have to generate lots of energy . I mean , the machine can handle birds and flowers and things like that , but in order to make you a whole woman , we 're talking about a major energy supply like , well , Kryptonite , which they house happen to have an ample supply of at the Schiff Military Research Institute . Now I want you to force them to put it all inside this lead box . See , that 'll protect you from the radiation . Me not need . Kryptonite not hurt Bizarro . Kryptonite not hurt Bizarro ? Wow , I 'm loving this guy more and more . Damnedest thing I 've ever seen . I don 't suppose we could broil it and make believe we never saw it ? [ Lana ] Mr. Jackson . We 're busy . We 're busy . We thought this was important , sir . We 've been getting calls about weird white birds exploding in the sky . [ explosion ] [ men and women shouting ] Are you OK ? Sure . That was pretty incredible , Clark . I didn 't know you had it in you . I usually don 't . There 's got to be some rational explanation for those birds . There is . They 're bizarro duplicates and they 're unstable . You mean like old dynamite ? Sometimes they blow up right away and sometimes it takes a while . - You can never tell . - Unpredictable . - Like Bizarro . - Why isn 't he blown up ? Superboy exposed him to a piece of Bizarro Kryptonite and it stabilized him . Then whoever 's using the machine must not know about that . Apparently not . [ alarm blaring ] - Clark , what is it ? - You OK , man ? Yeah , I just need a little air . The kid is right . Let him go home , get some rest . As a matter of fact , take tomorrow off , Clark . [ screams ] Luthor am right . You always try to beat me for being happy . Luthor . Go back to old jail without Kryptonite . Luthor make wife for Bizarro . Bizarro , no . He 's trying to trick you . No . Luthor help Bizarro . And now me kill Luthor . [ gasps ] [ grunts ] Get Kryptonite like you asked . Superboy try to stop me . Him dead . Superboy is dead ? Just like that ? [ laughs ] I don 't supposed you 'd be offended if I asked to see the body . First , you make me someone to love . OK , OK , OK , OK , OK . It 's not hard to see what 's on your mind . I guess this is show time . Darla , hon , can we see you for a sec ? Lex , sweetie , this isn 't gonna hurt or anything , is it ? Relax , babe . You 'll be fine . - [ machine beeps ] - I hope . It 's OK , Lex . I 'm OK . [ laughs ] Am she the one ? Yes , Bizarro , she am . Allow me to introduce you to your blushing bride . [ screams ] No , no , no , my dear . Let 's not be shy . You 'll make a charming couple I 'm sure . She hate me . She loves you . No , no , she 's just awestruck by your rugged good looks . You lied , Bizarro . You mock me . Mock ? You ? Bizarro , babe , this chick is hot for you . I can 't believe it . She fell for you . We gotta get out of here before ... Oh , no , no , no . No , don 't , please . Wait . We can try again . She was unstable . Hey , I can fix that , Bizarro , babe , for old time 's sake . Darla , he 's gonna kill me . Lex , what do you want me to do ? [ screams ] [ screams ] [ music playing ]

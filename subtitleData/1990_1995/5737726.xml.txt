 Everybody , heads up ! Heads up ! Keep clear ! Keep it clear ! Okay , down ! Andale , si ! Vamonos . Keep it goin ' ! Come on ! That 's good , stay ! Slow it down . No lo vayan a tirar ! Cuidado ! Traigala , traigala ! Okay , pushing team , move in there . Move it ! Cuidado , vamos ! I want tasers on full charge . Aaah ! Come on , step back in . Move it ! Adelante ! Puje , puje ! And push ! We 're locked . Loading team , step away . Gate keeper ! Jophery , raise the gate . Aaah ! Aaah ! Block the opening ! Don 't let her get out ! Aaah ! Aaah ! Work her back ! Aaah ! Shoot her ! Shoot her ! Aaah ! Apuesto mil pesos que se cae . Hola , Juanito . Hola . Bienvenido . What 's this I hear at the airport ? Hammond 's not even here ? He sends his apologies . We are facing a $ 20-million lawsuit by the family of that worker , and you 're telling me that Hammond can 't even be bothered to see me ? He wants to be with his daughter . She 's getting a divorce . I understand that , but we 've been advised to deal with the situation now . The insurance company - Okay ? The underwriters feel that the accident has raised ... some very serious safety questions about the park . That makes the investors very , very anxious . I had to promise to conduct a very thorough on-site inspection . Hammond hates inspections . They slow everything down . Juanito , they 'll pull the funding . Jefe , jefe ! That 'll slow him down more . Encontramos otros mosquitos . Seguro ? A ver , muestrame . Si , venga . Ooh ! Aaah ! Watch your head . If two experts sign off on the island , the insurance guys will back off . I 've already got Ian Malcolm , but they think he 's too trendy . They want Alan Grant . Grant ? You 'll never get him out of Montana . Luz , mas luz ! Why not ? Muchachos , echenme luz ! Si . Why not ? Because Grant 's like me . He 's a digger . Que lindo eres . Vas a ser - Dr. Grant , Dr. Sattler , we 're ready to try again . I hate computers . The feeling 's mutual . You 'll get a reading from that . Take a look . Did it work ? How long does this take ? It should bring an immediate return . You shoot the radar into the ground , and the bone bounces the image back . Bounces it back . This new program 's incredible . A few more years 'development , and we won 't even have to dig anymore . Where 's the fun in that ? It 's a little distorted , but I don 't think it 's the computer . Oh . Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments . Velociraptor ? Yes , good shape too . It 's five , six feet high , I 'm guessing nine feet long . Look at the extraordinary - What 'd you do ? He touched it . Dr. Grant 's not machine compatible . Hell , they 've got it in for me . And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrist . It 's no wonder these guys learned how to fly . No , seriously . Well , maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds ... than they do with reptiles . Look at the pubic bone , turned backward , just like a bird . Look at the vertebrae , full of air sacs and hollows , just like a bird . And even the word " raptor " means " bird of prey . " That doesn 't look very scary . That kid 's a pistol . More like a six-foot turkey . A turkey , huh ? Oh , no . Here we go . Okay , try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period . You get your first look at this six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing . He moves like a bird , lightly bobbing his head . And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity ... is based on movement , like T-Rex , and he 'll lose you if you don 't move . But no , not Velociraptor . You stare at him , and he just stares right back . And that 's when the attack comes . Not from the front , but from the side . From the other two raptors you didn 't even know were there . Because Velociraptor 's a pack hunter , you see . He uses coordinated attack patterns , and he is out in force today . And he slashes at you with this , a six-inch retractable claw , like a razor , on the middle toe . He doesn 't bother to bite your jugular like a lion , say . No , no . He slashes at you here or here . Oh , Alan . Or maybe across the belly , spilling your intestines . The point is , you are alive when they start to eat you . So you know , try to show a little respect . Okay . Hey , Alan , if you wanted to scare the kid , you could have pulled a gun on him , you know . Yeah , I know . Kids . You want to have one of those ? I don 't want that kid . But a breed of child , Dr. Grant , could be intriguing . I mean , what 's so wrong with kids ? Oh , Ellie , look . They 're noisy , they 're messy , they 're expensive . Cheap , cheap . They smell . They do not smell . Give me a break ! Some of them smell . Babies smell . Cover the site ! Cover up the dig ! Tell them to shut down ! Shut down ! Cut the machine ! Cover it all up ! Pull it over ! Just cut it , will ya ? Cut it out ! Shut it down ! What ? What the hell do you think you 're doing in here ? Hey , we were saving that ! For today . I guarantee it . Who in God 's name do you think you are ? John Hammond , and I 'm delighted to meet you finally in person , Dr. Grant . Mr. Hammond - Well , I can see that my , uh , 50,000 a year has been well spent . Okay , who 's the jerk ? Uh , this is our paleobotanist , Dr. - Sattler . Aha ! Ellie , this is , uh , Mr. Hammond . I 'm sorry about the dramatic entrance , Dr. Sattler , but we 're in a wee bit of a hurry . Did I say " jerk " ? Will you have a drink ? We won 't let it get warm . Come along , sit down . Here , let me - I 'll just get a glass or two . No , no , no , no , I can manage this . I know my way around the kitchen . Now , I 'll get right to the point . Um , I like ya , both of ya . I can tell instantly about people . It 's a gift . I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica . I 've leased it from the government , and I 've spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve . Really spectacular . Spared no expense . Make the one I 've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo . And there 's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds . And what are those ? Small versions of adults , honey . And not just kids , everyone . We 're going to open next year . That is , if the lawyers don 't kill me first . I don 't care for lawyers . Do you ? Oh , we , uh , don 't know any . I don 't really know any . Well , I do , I 'm afraid . There 's a particular pebble in my shoe , represents my investors . Says that they insist on outside opinions . What kind of opinions ? Well , your kind , not to put too fine a point on it . I mean , let 's face it . In your particular field , you 're the top minds . And if I could just persuade you to sign off on the park , you know , give it your endorsement , maybe even pen a wee testimonial , I could get back on " shedual , " uh , schedule . Why would they care what we think ? What kind of park is this ? It 's right up your alley . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't you come down , just the pair of ya , for the weekend ? I 'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well . I 've got a jet standing by at Choteau . Look , I 'm sorry . This is impossible . Yeah , we - We just dug up a new skeleton . I could compensate you by fully funding your dig . And this is a very unusual time . The timing is - For a further three years . Hmm ? Well , uh , where 's the plane ? Yeah , okay . Cheers . Cheers . Okay . Yo , Dodgson ! You shouldn 't use my name . Dodgson , Dodgson ! We 've got Dodgson here ! See ? Nobody cares . Nice hat . What are you tryin ' to look like , a secret agent ? Well ? Seven fifty . On delivery , 50,000 more for each viable embryo . That 's 1.5 million , if you get all 15 species off the island . Oh , I 'll get ' em all . Remember , viable embryos . They 're no use to us if they don 't survive . Oh ! How am I supposed to transport them ? The bottom screws open . That 's great . Oh , my God . It 's cooled and compartmentalized inside . Oh , that 's great ! Customs can even check it if they want to . Let me see . Oh ! Go on . There 's enough coolant inside for 36 hours . No menthol ? The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then . That 's up to your guy on the boat . 7 : 00 tomorrow night on the east dock . Make sure he gets it right . How are you planning to beat security ? I 've got an 18-minute window . Eighteen minutes , and your company catches up on ten years of research . Gracias , senor . Don 't get cheap on me , Dodgson . That was Hammond 's mistake . So you two , um , dig up dinosaurs ? Well - We try to . You 'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm . He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality , especially for a mathematician . Chaotician , actually . John doesn 't subscribe to chaos , particularly what it has to say about his science project . Codswallop , Ian . You 've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns about the island . Oh , John , John . Because of the behavior of the system in phase space ? A load , if I may say so , of fashionable number crunching . Is not . I do wish you wouldn 't do that . Dr. Sattler , Dr. Grant , you 've heard of chaos theory ? No . No ? Non-linear equations ? Strange attractors ? Dr. Sattler , I refuse to believe that you ... aren 't familiar with the concept of attraction . Hmm ! I bring scientists , you bring a rock star . There it is . Bad wind shears . We have to drop pretty fast , so hold on , 'cause it can be just a little thrilling . Ya-hoo ! No , no , you need that piece over here , and that piece - Look , we 'll have landed by the time you get it right . The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place ? And the concrete moats , and the motion sensor tracking systems . Donald , dear boy , relax . Try and enjoy yourself . Let 's get something straight , John . This is not a weekend excursion . This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . Your investors , whom I represent , are deeply concerned . Forty-eight hours from now , if they 're not convinced , I 'm not convinced . I 'll shut you down , John . In 48 hours , I 'llbe accepting your apologies . All right , slow down . Stop , stop , stop ! This shouldn 't be here . Alan , this species of veriforman 's been extinct ... since the Cretaceous Period . I mean , this thing is humongous . What ? What ? Look at that . Um , it 's - it 's a dinosaur . Uh-huh . You did it . You crazy son of a bitch , you did it . Oh , Ellie , we could just tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness . It doesn 't apply . They 're totally wrong . This is a warm-blooded creature . This thing doesn 't live in a swamp . - This thing 's got what , a 27-foot neck ? - The brachiosaur , 30 . Thirty feet . We 're gonna make a fortune with this place . How fast are they ? Well , we clocked the T-Rex ... at 32 miles an hour . T - T-Rex ? Mm-hmm . You said you 've got a T-Rex ? Uh-huh . Say again . We have a T-Rex . Oh . Put your head between your knees . Dr. Grant , my dear Dr. Sattler , welcome to Jurassic Park . They 're moving in herds . They do move in herds . How 'd you do this ? I 'll show you . G 'day , g 'day , g 'day ! Now , the most advanced amusement park in the entire world , incorporating all the latest technologies . And I 'm not talking just about rides , you know . Everybody has rides . No , we 've made living biological attractions so astounding ... that they 'll capture the imagination of the entire planet . So what are you thinking ? That we 're out of a job . Don 't you mean " extinct " ? Well , now , why don 't you all sit down ? Uh , Donald , sit down , sit down . Ah , here . Here he comes . Well , here I come . Yes . Hello , hello . Say hello . Say hello . Hello . H - Hello . Hello , John . Oh , yes , I 've got lines . Well , fine , fine , I guess . But how did I get here ? Uh , uh , well , let me show you . First I 'll need a drop of blood , your blood . Right . Ooh ! John , that hurt . Relax , John , it 's all part of the miracle of cloning . Hello , John . Hello , John . Hello . Cloned from what ? Loy extraction has never recreated an intact D.N.A. strand . Not without massive sequence gaps . Paleo-D.N.A. from what source ? Where do you get a 100-million-year-old dinosaur blood ? Shhh ! What ? What ? Oh , well , Mr. D.N.A. ! Where did you come from ? From your blood . Just one drop of your blood contains ... billions of strands of D.N.A. , the building blocks of life . A D.N.A. strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing . And sometimes , animals that went extinct millions of years ago , like dinosaurs , left their blueprints behind for us to find . We just had to know where to look . 100 million years ago , there were mosquitoes , just like today . And just like today , they fed on the blood of animals , even dinosaurs . Sometimes , after biting 'a dinosaur , the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree ... and get stuck in the sap . After a long time , the tree sap would get hard ... and become fossilized , just like a dinosaur bone , preserving the mosquito inside . This fossilized tree sap , which we call amber , waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside . Until Jurassic Park scientists came along . Using sophisticated techniques , they extract the preserved blood from the mosquito , and bingo . : dino D.N.A. A full D.N.A. strand contains three billion genetic codes . If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day , it 'd take two years to look at the entire D.N.A. strand . It 's that long . Since it 's so old , it 's full of holes . Now that 's where our geneticists take over . Thinkin 'machine super-computers and gene sequencers ... break down the strand in minutes . And virtual-reality displays show our geneticists the gaps in the D.N.A. sequence . We use the complete D.N.A. of a frog to fill in the holes ... and complete the code . Phew ! And now , we can make a baby dinosaur . This score is only temporary . It all has very dramatic music , of course . Rum-pum-pum ! A march or something . It hasn 't been written yet . And then , of course , the tour moves on . Well , lookie here ! Those hard-workin 'cowpokes you see behind the glass - This is overwhelming , John . Are - Are these characters , uh , auto-erotica ? No , no , no , we have no animatronics here , no . Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park . ... D.N.A. in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs . Wait a minute . How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis ? Can 't we see the unfertilized eggs ? Shortly , shortly , shortly . Now , a whole team of genetic engineers - Can 't - Can 't you stop these things ? I 'm sorry , it 's kind of a ride . One , two , three . Uh - You can 't do that . What ? Can they do that ? A reminder . : The boat for the mainland will be leaving at 1900 hours . All personnel be at the dock no later than 1845 . No exceptions . G 'day , Henry . Oh , good day , sir . Oh . It 's turning the eggs . Oh , God . Oh , perfect timing . I 'd hoped they 'd hatch before I had to go to the boat . Henry , Henry , Henry , why didn 't you tell me ? I insist on being here when they 're born . Come on , come on . Come on , little one . Come on . Come on , little one , come on . Come on , then . Come on , then . Very good . Push , push ! Very good ! Oh , God . Push , come on ! Come on , then . Come on , then . There you are . There you are . There . They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with . That 's it ! Helps them to trust me . I 've been present for the birth ... of every little creature on this island . Well , surely not the ones that have bred in the wilds . Yes . Actually , they can 't breed in the wild . Population control is one of our security precautions . There 's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park . How do you know they can 't breed ? Well , because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female . Oh . We 've engineered them that way . There you are . Oh , my God ! Look at that . Blood temperature seems like about high 80 's maybe . Wu ? Uh , 91 . Homeothermic ? It holds that temperature ? Mm-hmm , yeah . That 's incredible . Ooh . But , um , again , how do you know they 're all female ? What , does somebody go out in the park and pull up the dinosaurs ' skirts ? We control their chromosomes . It 's really not that difficult . All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway . They require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male . We simply deny them that . Deny them that ? John , the kind of control ... you 're attempting is , uh , it 's not possible . If there 's one thing the history of evolution has taught us , it 's that life will not be contained . Life breaks free , it expands to new territories ... and crashes through barriers painfully , maybe even dangerously , but , uh , well , there it is . There it is . You 're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed ? No , I 'm simply saying that life , uh , finds a way . What species is this ? Uh ... it 's a velociraptor . You bred raptors ? Dr. Grant , as I was saying , we laid on lunch for you before you set out into the park . Our gourmet chef , Alejandro - Oh . What are they doing ? Feeding them . Alejandro 's , uh , prepared a delightful menu for us : Chilean sea bass , I believe . Uh , shall we ? They should all be destroyed . Robert . Robert Muldoon , my game warden from Kenya . Bit of an alarmist , I 'm afraid , but knows more about raptors than anyone . What kind of metabolism do they have ? What 's their growth rate ? They 're lethal at eight months , and I do mean lethal . I 've hunted most things that can hunt you , but the way these things move - Fast for a biped ? Cheetah speed . Fifty , sixty miles per hour , if they ever got out in the open . And they 're astonishing jumpers . Yes , yes , yes , yes . That 's why we 're taking extreme precautions . The viewing area set down below here ... Do they show intelligence ? With their brain cavities , we assumed that - They 're extremely intelligent . Even problem-solving intelligence ; especially the big one . We bred eight originally , but she took over the pride ... and killed all but two of the others . That one , when she looks at you , you can see she 's working things out . That 's why we have to feed ' em like this . She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . The fences are electrified , though , right ? That 's right , but they never attack the same place twice . They were testing the fences for weaknesses systematically . They remember . Yes . Well . Who 's hungry ? More adventurous guests ... can opt for ourjungle river cruise or for a close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs - None of these attractions are ready yet , but the park will open with the basic tour you 're about to take . Other rides will come on-line six or twelve months after that . Absolutely spectacular designs . Spared no expense . And we can charge anything we want : 2,000 a day , 10,000 a day . And people will pay it . Then there 's the merchandise . I can personally advise - Donald . Donald . This park was not built to cater only for the super rich . Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals . Sure . They will . What , we 'll have , uh , a coupon day or something . Gee , the lack of humility before nature that 's being displayed here , um ... staggers me . Well , thank you , Dr. Malcolm , but I think things are a little bit different ... than you and I feared . Yeah . They 're a lot worse . Now wait a second . We haven 't even seen the park yet , and you - No , Donald , Donald . Donald , let him talk . I want to hear every viewpoint . I really do . Yeah . Don 't you see the danger , uh , John , inherent in what you 're doing here ? Genetic power 's the most awesome force the planet 's ever seen , but you wield it like a kid that 's found his dad 's gun . - It 's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations - - If I may . Um , I 'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you 're using here . Uh , it didn 't require any discipline to attain it . You know , you read what others had done and you took the next step . You didn 't earn the knowledge for yourselves , so you don 't take any responsibility ... for it . You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could , and before you even knew what you had , you patented it , packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunch box . And now you 're selling it . You wanna sell it . Well - I , I don 't think you 're giving us our due credit . Our scientists have done things which nobody 's ever done before . Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could , they didn 't stop to think if they should . Condors . Condors are on the verge of extinction . No ! If I was to - No , no . If I was to create a flock of condors , you wouldn 't have anything to say . Hold on . This isn 't some species that was obliterated by deforestation ... or the building of a dam . Dinosaurs , uh , uh , had their shot , and nature selected them for extinction . I simply don 't understand this Luddite attitude , especially from a scientist . I mean , how can we stand in the light of discovery and not act ? Oh , what 's so great about discovery ? It 's a violent , penetrative act that scars what it explores . What you call discovery ... I call the rape of the natural world . Well , the question is : How can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem ? And therefore , how could you ever assume that you can control it ? You have plants in this building that are poisonous . You picked them because they look good ; but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they 're in , and they 'll defend themselves , violently , if necessary . Dr. Grant , if there 's one person here ... who could appreciate what I 'm trying to do - The world has just changed so radically , and we 're all running to catch up . I don 't want to jump to any conclusions , but look , dinosaurs and man , two species separated by 65 million years of evolution , have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together . How can we possibly have the slightest idea of what to expect ? I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it . You 're meant to defend me against these characters , and the only one I 've got on my side is the bloodsucking lawyer . Thank you . Well . They 're here . You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park . Spend a little time with our target audience . - Grandpa ! - Kids ! Wait ! Careful with the old man . We miss you . Thanks for the presents . We loved the presents . They were great . Did you enjoy the helicopter ? Yeah ! It went down , and we all went right up . Now , kids , come away . Not too close to the cars . Aren 't they lovely ? Aren 't they glorious ? These will be your transports for the afternoon . No drivers . No , no , no , no . No drivers . They 're electric . They run on this track in the middle of the roadway . Totally non-polluting . Top of the line . Spared no expense . It 's an interactive CD-ROM ! Look ! You just touch the screen and it talks about whatever you want . Lex , darling , you 're all right in there . Dr. Sattler , come with me . Dr. Grant , come in the second car . I 'm gonna ride with , uh , Dr. Sattler . I read your book . Well , that 's ... that 's great . Do you really think that dinosaurs turned into birds and that 's where they all went ? Well , a few species may have evolved along those lines . They sure don 't look like birds to me . I heard that there 's this , um , meteor , hit the earth someplace in Mexico and made this big crater ? Listen , uh - Tim . Tim , which car were you planning on ? Whichever one you are . Then I heard about this thing in Omni ... about this , um , meteor making all this heat . And it made diamond dust . That changed the weather , and they died because of the weather . Then my teacher tells me about this book by a guy named Bakker . He says - She said I should ride with you because it 'd be good for you . The boat is now loading . Everyone must be on the dock for the 1900-hour departure . National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm ... National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm ... about 75 miles west of us . Aye-yi-yi-yi . Why didn 't I build in Orlando ? I 'll keep an eye on it . Maybe it 'll spring south like the last one . Ray , start the tour program . Hold onto your butts . And why did they put the fiberglass thing ? I know . What kind of dinosaurs are we gonna see now ? Hey , lookit ! A ghost , a ghost ! Aah ! Oh , no . It 's driving . Turn in your fear at the door and join the future , right ? Oh , God help us . We 're in the hands of engineers . During most of your tour , the appropriate information ... will be automatically selected and displayed for you . Hey , look ! Simply touch the area of the screen displaying ... the appropriate icon . Are we gonna hit that ? Welcome to Jurassic Park . What have they got in there , King Kong ? The voice you 're now hearing is Richard Kiley . We spared no expense . If you look to the right , you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs on our tour , called Dilophosaurus . - Dilophosaurus ! - Oh , shit ! One of the earliest carnivores , we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous , spitting its venom at its prey , causing blindness and eventually paralysis , allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure . I can 't see . This makes Dilophosaurus ... a beautiful but deadly addition ... to Jurassic Park . Alan ... where ? Damn . Vehicle headlights are on and they 're not responding . Those shouldn 't be running off the car batteries . Item 151 on today 's glitch list . We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo , and the computers aren 't even on their feet yet . Dennis , our lives are in your hands , and you have butterfingers ? I 'm totally unappreciated in my time . You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days . You think that kind of automation is easy ? Or cheap ? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines ... and debug two million lines of code for what I bid for this job ? If you can , I 'd love to see him try . I 'm sorry ... about your financial problems , but they are your problems . Oh , you 're right , you 're absolutely right . Everything 's my problem . I will not get drawn into another financial debate with you , Dennis . I really will not . There 's been hardly any debate at all . I don 't blame people for their mistakes , but I do ask that they pay for them . Thanks , Dad . Dennis ! The headlights . Yeah . I 'll debug the tour program when they get back , okay ? Okay ? It 'll eat a lot of compute cycles . We 'll lose part of the system for a while . There 's a finite amount of memory . You gonna compile for half an hour , for crying out loud ? Quiet ! All of you ! They 're approaching the tyrannosaur paddock . God creates dinosaurs . God destroys dinosaurs . God creates man . Man destroys God . Man creates dinosaurs . Dinosaurs ... eat man . Woman inherits the Earth . We 'll try to tempt the Rex now . Keep watching the fence . What 's gonna happen to the goat ? He 's gonna eat the goat ? Excellent . What 's the matter , kid ? You never had lamb chops ? I happen to be a vegetarian . T - Rex doesn 't want to be fed . He wants to hunt . Can 't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct . Uh , uh , now , eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs ... on your , on your dinosaur tour , right ? Hello ? H-Hello . Yes ? I really hate that man . See , the tyrannosaur , uh , uh , doesn 't obey any set patterns or , or park schedules . The essence , uh , of chaos . Um , I 'm still not clear on chaos . Wh-What does that mean ? Oh , oh , it simply deals with , uh , unpredictability in complex systems . The shorthand is the , the Butterfly Effect . A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking , and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine . I go too fast . I did a fly-by . I missed it . Give me that glass of water . We 're going to conduct an experiment . It should be still . The car 's bouncin ' up and down , but that 's okay . Now , put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic . Say a drop of water falls on your hand . Which way is the drop going to fall off ? Which finger ? Thumb , I 'd say . Aha . Okay . Now freeze your hand . Don 't move . I 'm going to do the same thing , start with the same place again . Which way is it going to roll off ? Let 's say back , the same way . S - Same way . Back the same way . It changed . It changed . Why ? Because tiny variations : uh , the orientation of the hairs on your hands , Hey , Alan , look at this . um , the amount of blood distending your vessels , imperfections in the skin - Imperfections in the skin ? Oh , just ... microscopic . Microscopic . And never repeat and vastly affect the outcome . That 's ... what ? Unpredictability . Right . There . Look at this . See ? I 'm right again . Nobody could 've predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly , suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle . Alan ? Alan ! There 's , uh , another example . See , here I 'm now by myself , uh , er , talking to myself . That 's , that 's chaos theory . Stop the program . Stop the program . I told you how many times ... we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors ? Stopping park vehicles and rebooting program . We 're on . Will notify for resume . I 'll switch it over to TelePromp Ter . What about the circuit integrities ? Screen says faulty sensor . I 'll call security . We 're a full go on that . Looks good . Like I was saying , there 's this other book by a guy named Bakker , - and he says the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases . - Where are we going ? You see something ? Is there anybody else who thinks we shouldn 't be out here ? His book was a lot fatter than yours was . Really ? Yours was fully illustrated , honey . Hey . You okay ? Hey , look at this . Wait . Hey , watch . Hey , come on . Watch this . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Everybody stay here . Timmy ! Hey , Timmy - Oh , wow . Okay ? Of course . Don 't be scared . It 's okay . Muldoon tranquilized her for me . She 's sick . Oh , my God . Hey ! Hey , baby . Hey , baby girl . Yeah . She was my favorite when I was a kid . Now I see her , she 's the most beautiful thing I ever saw . It 's okay . Microvesicles . That 's interesting . Thanks . What are her symptoms ? Oh , imbalance , disorientation , labored breathing . Right . It seems to happen about every six weeks or so . Six weeks . These are dilated . Take a look . They are ? It 's okay . I 'll be damned . That 's pharmacological . From local plant life . Is this West Indian lilac ? Yes . We know they 're toxic , but the animals don 't eat ' em . Are you sure ? Pretty sure . There 's only one way to be positive . I 'd have to see the dinosaur 's droppings . Dino ... droppings , droppings ? Yeah . Yep . Yep . Yeah , I got that . That storm center hasn 't dissipated or changed course . We 're gonna have to cut the tour short , I 'm afraid . Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off . Are you sure we have to ? It 's not worth taking the chance . Well - Sustained winds , 45 knots .

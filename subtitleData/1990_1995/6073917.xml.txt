 ( male narrator ) Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth . Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent . He learned , he possessed the strength of steel . The speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is ... Superboy . [ theme music ] [ music continues ] [ ticking ] [ indistinct chatter ] We don 't know what it is . The kid who found it said it dropped out of the sky . He brought in here an hour ago then it started making that noise . That 's when they called us . The problem is we can 't get inside . We were hoping you could . Well , let 's see what 's in there first . [ shrill squeal ] See anything ? No , it 's nothing I 've ever seen before . [ ticking ] I 'm gonna try something , you better step back . Delighted . [ zapping ] [ ticking stops ] [ indistinct chatter ] Any idea what it was ? [ buzzing ] - What 's that ? - I don 't know . Maybe , it 's a signal . [ sizzling ] [ theme music ] Well , who are you ? - Let him go ! - Lana , stop . [ theme music ] - Where on earth are we ? - Lana ... we 're not on the Earth . [ theme music ] [ theme music ] It was a trap . They used the bomb to find me . They knew I 'd be the only one who 'd be able to disarm it . Well , what do they want you for ? [ indistinct chatter ] [ theme music ] Was it really such a good idea to bring him here , captain ? - Are you suggesting it wasn 't ? - Certainly not , sir . Someone as simple minded as I would be a fool to question your judgment . I ... I was just trying to learn from you , that 's all . Alright . Then wait and see . - Are you the one ? - What do you mean ? The one we 've been waiting for all these years . The great warrior . There 's a good argument here for lying , you know . We were brought here against our will . We wanna know why . We 're all here against our will . But please , you haven 't answered our question . I 'm not sure I understand it . [ theme music ] These are the lamentations of our people . They were carved before I was born . A long time ago .. ... our planet become barren . Food would no longer grow in its soil . This craft ... was built to take us to another planet . A new fertile place near Alpha Centauri . And after years of travel , we never got there . Some of us thought it was the captains fault . There was a mutiny . - He put you all here ? - He brought our parents here . That 's the grandfather of the present captain . He was just as bad . He 's put many of us here since . Our only hope has been .. ... has been this great prophesy . Have mercy on us . Help us . One thing 's for sure . We 're not staying here . Everyone , to the door . [ all cheering ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ zapping ] I 've never seen metal like this . - Is it like the bomb ? - No , it 's harder . See , they 've just discovered their savior is no better off than they are . They 're hope 's been crushed . It is truly wonderful to be near you , captain . To bask in the warmth of such brilliance . Yes , you 're a lucky man . Now , wipe my chin . [ theme music ] [ water dripping ] - You thirsty ? - A little . - It just has to be treated . - Treated ? First we kill the germs . [ zapping ] Now , we 'll cool it back down again . - Here . - Thanks . That fountain belongs to the Niverites . We took it from the Minarets . Well , whoever it belongs to , there 's still plenty left . That 's not the point . It 's our fountain now . - Who are the Minarets ? - Sludge , vermin . The captain favors them with extra food . Are they the ones we saw when we came in ? Those were the Tiaren . They were stupid enough to think that you were going to save them . They 're sludge , too . Can 't you tell the difference ? Not really . Are you saying that I look like a Minaret or a Tiaren . Is that what you 're saying ? [ theme music ] - You 're strong as I am . - Stronger . How many of the others are like you ? Enough . Enough to kill all the Minarets and Tiarans some day . [ indistinct chatter ] Are any of them as strong as you ? Few . Then why haven 't you broken out ? - The jailor 's strong but- - - You mean , the mute Ta-El . He thinks the captain is going to make him our next leader . That 's why he 's so loyal . Whoever he is , he can 't stand up to all of you . All of us ? Are you saying that we should work with the Minarets and the Tiarens . Well , don 't you wanna get out ? [ indistinct chatter ] - They 'd betray us . - Don 't you understand ? The captain wants you to fight each other . That way you 're no threat to him . ( Superman ) Think about it . So ... our friend is organizing the masses ? We 'll have to do something about that . We could wipe out everyone in that prison in ten minutes . Wipe them out ? My grandfather built that place to show us commitment to law and order . It 's tradition . Then just Superboy . He could have an accident . That would make him a martyr . That 's the last thing I need down there . Well , I 've got to do something else to control him . You 've done well . May I return to the prison now ? I 'll get more information for you . You can 't very well return without some signs of punishment . - They 'll begin to suspect you . - I-I could lie . Do you have a problem with my idea ? Certainly not , sir . It 's a brilliant idea . Now , we all know the layout of the ship . There aren 't that many of them , so we won 't have a problem . But they 're strong so we need a plan . [ door opening ] [ indistinct chatter ] ( Lana ) He 's been hurt . [ Lana shouting ] Where 're you taking her ? He was carrying the key to solitary . It 's near the engines . I donno if she 'll be able to take the heat . It 's so intense . [ whirring ] [ theme music ] [ beeps ] [ door creeks ] Ah , there you are . At last I get to meet our newest resident . I trust you 've been comfortable so far . I want Lana back right now . Your friend , who you obviously feel strongly about is .. ... shall we say , in some place safe until ... you and I can work out an arrangement . Arrangement ? I need something from you and now you need something from me . - We can trade . - And what is it that you need ? Your cooperation . It is essential to me that the prisoners remain how shall I say , focused on each other so that I might run the ship more smoothly . I can 't have you in there causing trouble . Then why did you bring us here ? The prophecy . I donno how it got started but they all believe it and it gives them hope . Hope that one day they 'll escape before they have been properly rehabilitated . But seeing you helpless in there , the symbol of their hope they 'll know they can 't . When our viewing screens picked ... that up .. ... I knew you belonged here . If there 's so much discontent why don 't you just step down ? Step down ? Impossible ! I 'm the only one who knows where we 're going . - And where 's that ? - Paradise . A planet just west of Alpha Centauri . West ? Oh , don 't you worry about that . - Do we have a deal ? - Alright . - But if Lana 's hurt .. - Oh , no , no , no . She 's alive and well ... barely . Captain ... you believe in the prophesy too , don 't you ? What if I did ? It 's broken now . It can 't come true . [ theme music ] [ beeps ] Lana , are you alright ? How did you get me out of there ? I had to promise the captain I wouldn 't organize the prisoners . - You shouldn 't have done that . - It was the only way . And what did the captain give you ? Extra food , an early release ? Or maybe he just wants you to spy on us . We thought you 'd be a leader . You 're a fraud . The real warrior will kill you when he comes to save us . You don 't need me and you don 't need a warrior . You can get out of here on your own . Then , join the rest of your people and take back control of the ship . And we will . As soon as we kill all the Minarets and Tiarens . [ all shouting ] - Yes . - They 're hopeless . How much longer do we have to stay here ? I don 't know . At least not until we get to Alpha Centauri . West of Alpha Centauri . West of Alpha Centauri . ( Superboy ) Ta-Ei . You think you 're stronger than me ? Do you ? Let 's find out . He 's crazy . You can 't beat him . We 've tried . - She 's right . - I 'm not afraid of him . I challenge you ... a fight to the finish . - I had a deal with him . - Captain , listen . Or would the captain be afraid you might lose ? Unbelievable . I 'll have the girl put back in solitary immediately . No . Make Ta-El backed down , I 'll look like a coward . Well , then what ? I tried to be reasonable with him but if he wants to be a martyr so badly I say we make him one . [ crowd cheering ] This shouldn 't take long . ( Superboy ) He 's lost , you know ? The captain . He doesn 't know where he 's going . [ zapping ] What did he promise you ? That when you enter the new world that you 'd be leader ? Well , it isn 't going to happen . He 's going around in circles . He doesn 't want to get to the new planet even if it exists . As soon as he gets there he 's not going to be the captain anymore . What did he tell you ? West of Alpha Centauri ? There is no west in outer space or north , or south , or east . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . How dare he question my judgment ? West ? Go to the captain now . See if I 'm telling the truth . [ crowd cheers ] Looks like their prophecy came true after all . [ beeping ] As a boy , my father told me of a planet where everything was perfect . There was plenty of food , water . Everyone lives in peace . That 's where I wanted to go . Had I known it was only a dream . We 'd appreciate you if you would return us to the Earth . I kinda hoped you 'd stay on with us . There 's so much that we can still learn from you . No , I think you 've learned everything you need to know . I 'd suggest you go back to your home planet and try to making it work there . An excellent idea . So what are you gonna do with him ? I think there 's only one thing ... we can do . Full speed ahead . Let 's get this bucket of bolts moving . What 's taking so long ? Is this a crew , or a bunch of prima donnas . Get your backs into it , you slugs . This is your captain speaking . Look , I know where we 're .. We 're going to paradise . We 're going to paradise . Just west of Alpha Centauri . I know where it is . Follow me . I know , I know . Is anyone here with me ? Help ! Help ! [ music continues ]

Black Bolt , huh ? Well , la-di-da . Let 's see if he can handle an orange bolt ! Oh ! He floored Ben with one punch ! That 's impossible . The Thing is the strongest human alive . [ Johnny ] Maybe he 's just met the new number one . [ Sue ] Any ideas , darling ? I can 't keep this up indefinitely . These Inhumans seem more governed by fear than anger . - Ben ! Stop fighting ! - Yeah , sure thing ! Just as soon as I land one good haymaker ! Besides , Buttercup here ain 't sayin ' diddly ! Crystal ! No ! Johnny ! - I want to stay here with you ! - Hey ! No , my sister . We are family . We must always be with our own kind . - Johnny ! - [ Johnny ] Crystal ! No ! They 're about to vanish ! Flame on ! - Ow ! Torch ? ! - [ Sue ] Reed ! Johnny Storm !

I can be too hot to handle . You saved me . You came back for me . Well ... that 's my job . Black Bolt is grateful ! He will allow you humans to depart now . On the condition you vow not to reveal what you have seen . Allowing humans to leave the Great Refuge ! And they call me mad ! By reversing the ionic charge , I can create a negative barrier . To keep you prisoners of the Great Refuge forever ! - Say goodbyes ! We 're outta here ! - Not without Crystal ! - I won 't go without Crystal ! - Johnny , don 't leave me ! Ben , hurry ! I can 't hold the force field much longer . - I hate to do this , kid . - Crystal ! Johnny ... Call me Rosebud ! - [ Impossible Man ] Uh-oh ... - [ Johnny ] Oof ! Bad plan . Beam me up , Scotty ! Don 't just stand there . Get mean about it ! Mean ? Me ? Listen , if it ain 't fun it ain 't for Impossible Man . But call me curious . Cool ! I 'm getting a real kick out of this . How 's about you , Super Bowl Super Skrull ? I 'd better hustle on before Mr. Green Genes makes a return . From the Twilight Zone ! [ hums Twilight Zone theme ] Hey , what 's the matter , Embers ? - Lassie go home without you ? - I guess so . C 'mon , buck up ! How about a quick ride home , first class ? Got places to go , people to annoy , huh ? Hey , it 's my job . It 's what I do . [ Mr. Impossible ] So , you really carry a torch for that girl .

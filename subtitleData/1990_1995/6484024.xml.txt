 Last time on Stephen King 's Golden Years ... Dr Todhunter ! Overload across the board ! The janitor is growing younger . That means that the effects are much more powerful than we had thought . I want to take the janitor and his wife out of Falco Plains . I want to get them and take them anywhere , because if I don 't , Andrews will . You want permission to kidnap a woman and a man who may prove there is a fountain of youth ? Harlan , we can 't just go . - All our things ... - Gina , we have no other choice . He 's everything that 's wrong with everything . He 's not National Security , he 's Murder Incorporated . I could disappear without a trace and so could you . Harlan Williams . He 's your murder suspect . I think we 're safe on this road for maybe two hours , until they get their act together . Get a list of anything reported stolen in the last six hours . I 'm too old for this . That makes two of us , darling . Does it ? Please , Dr Ackerman . Just stay calm . I 'm as calm as a cucumber . I 'm sure there 's nothing to worry about . I 'm suggesting ... You 're suggesting that someone is getting rid of witnesses who know anything at all about Redding , Williams and the Gold Series explosions . You 're being paranoid . - Perfect paranoia is perfect awareness . - I beg your pardon ? Never mind . I want protection right away . - You knew Dr Eakins , didn 't you ? - Of course . We 've got eight consulting physicians in the county . I know them all . Eakins examined the janitor 's eyes and as far as I know , he 's the only one who 's been murdered . Had you spoken to Dr Eakins about Harlan Williams recently ? Within , let 's say , 48 hours of Eakins ' murder ? - No . - You sure about that ? - Of course ! - Then you 're safe . The murder probably isn 't linked with the Gold Series . Even if it was , you 're in the clear . You haven 't spoken to him . So what I want you to do is perfectly simple . You stay put . I 'll be landing in about 40 minutes . We can discuss things further then . If there 's anything to discuss . - I want protection now , damn it ! - Get control of yourself ! - Just stay put , until ... - Go to hell . I 'll just take care of myself , thank you very much . Can you push this thing any faster ? Damn fool . Dr Ackermann ... Yes ? What is it ? I 've been looking for you . Mr Andrews called . He wants to see you this afternoon . Not today . Just tell him I 'll call him tomorrow . Well ... What do you think ? I think if a man looked at it too long , it would boil his eyeballs . What did you say about driving the Chrysler building to Chicago ? I didn 't think you 'd take me seriously . Actually , it was a damn good idea , Harlan . Hey , Gina ! Want to see something that 'll boil your eyeballs ? Hey , sweetheart . - Maybe she didn 't hear you . - She 's not deaf . Gina ? - Are you okay , darling ? - I 'm fine . Just leave me alone for a while , Harl . - What 's wrong , honey ? - Please , leave me alone . - Can 't you understand English ? - Gina , tell me what 's wrong . Can 't you see what 's wrong ? I 'm old . I don 't want you looking at me , because I 'm old . Honey ... Gina . I 've never felt old before , because we 've always been together . And now , I 'm old . - I am old . - Hush . - I 'm old , too . I 'll be 71 next fall . - No . You got it wrong , Harl . Today is your birthday . - No , it 's not . It 's ... - Yes . It 's today . And I 'd say you were 65 . - Gina ... - Don 't you think I know ? Haven 't I lived with you long enough to have a pretty good idea of how old my husband is ? Today , you 're 65 . You 'll have a birthday again in another week and you 'll be 60 . And then , a few days after that , you 'll be 55 . Because it 's not slowing down . It 's not ! Gina , it 's just a bit of man-made freakishness , that 's all . It could be a lot worse . I could be changing into a human alligator , like in the horror movies . But I 'm just an old man . With a younger man 's face . You really believe that , don 't you ? - Of course I believe that . - Well , why not ? Don 't old people all over the world say they still feel 16 inside ? Even when they can 't stand up straight . Or walk a mile without having to stop and sit down to catch their breath . So why shouldn 't you feel old , while you 're getting younger ? You don 't even know that you feel young . Do you , Harl ? It 's kind of funny when you think about it . You just need some sleep , Mother . You 'll feel better tomorrow . Yes . I 'll feel better tomorrow . I 'll also be older and you 'll be younger . You keep saying that . Yes , because I see the way you walk . I see the way you smile . You say I need sleep . You 're right . I am beat . But you 're not beat . You 've been up as long as I have , but you 're not even breathing hard . No , but my feet hurt like hell . Part of you is enjoying this . Gina , that 's not true at all . You really believe that , too . I see the way your head turns when you smell something in the woods , or suddenly hear something that I can 't hear anymore . You don 't see the light in your eyes , Harl . But I do . I do . Dr Todhunter , I need your signature . - What time do you have ? - It 's half past the hour . - Are we ready ? - Yes . It 's scheduled for this afternoon . - Do it now . - Now , Dr ... Do it now . - Sir , but you see ... - Do it now ! Do it now ! Now you listen to me , you overpriced , overpaid simpleton . Time marches to the beat of a very different drummer . - You don 't see that ? - But ... Just open your ears and you can hear it . I hear it all the time . Tap , tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping in my brain , Like a little drum that says : " Don 't wait . Don 't wait . " " Don 't wait ! " - Do it now ! Do it now ! - Yes , Sir . Do it now . Do it now ! Do it now . Harlan . What ? - Are you coming ? - In a minute . I 'm sorry , but I 'm not going to be able to sleep a wink until I take a look . He 's about 60 . He 's skinny as a chicken leg . He looks like my cousin Cecil . - You peeked ? - Of course I peeked . I told him we 'd get him back to his people as soon as we could . Now , come on to bed . I don 't know . I ... I 've sure been to enough funerals , but dead bodies still give me the willies . Do you remember that mummy we saw at Coney Island ? King Ramesses . 2000 years old . How can you remember his name ? You dared me to touch it . How could I not remember ? I remember all those things we did in those days . I remember all of them . Remember how we 'd go down to the water ? Pretending we were leaving on a voyage ? The Queen Elisabeth . 1st class , starboard side ? Boats would pull away from the peer . Balloons tied to their rails . All the people waving and cheering . People on the boats . People on the pier . Harlan ... You 're one of the people on the boat now . And I 'm one of the people on the pier . I 'm waving to you . And the water between us is getting wider , and the boat 's getting smaller , and smaller . And pretty soon , it 'll be too small to see . And you 'll be gone . You 'll be gone . I 'll just take care of myself , thank you very much . I didn 't know this was happy hour . You got any beer ? I want you off this base , Mister . Domestic 's fine . I 'm not picky . Beans and pork rinds . They 're hell for the old cholesterol , but nobody lives forever . I 'll give you exactly one hour , or ... - You 'll throw me in the brig ? - No , in the infirmary . In restraints , and so doped up you 'll think you 're on the Starship Enterprise . No , you won 't . - What did you say ? - This is my investigation now . Oh , is it ? And who , may I ask , made it your investigation ? The Defence Secretary of the United States of America , Sir . The orders were telexed at 3.09 this afternoon . I 'm also in charge of the investigation of the doctor 's cowardly murder . You bastard ! Looks like the work of terrorists . Car bomb . Standard stuff . Yeah . Typical slimeball tactics . I 've also been charged with the recovery of Harlan Williams , who seems to have been infected by this incursion . It also seems likely it 's had an adverse , a dangerously adverse effect on his mental state . What are you talking about ? He wanted to keep his job . And , in fact , he was obsessed with his job . When he failed his eye exam , the doctor who failed him was murdered . - He passed the retest . - Did he ? That 's hard to tell . William 's file is missing from Eakins ' office . That 's interesting , because a few hours ago his medical records were stolen from Falco Plains . I know . By Dr Ackerman . We found part of Williams ' file in his car . Photocopies . Somebody broke in to the records file and took the originals . Ackerman . Ackerman had a key . He wouldn 't need to break in . Maybe he wanted to make it look like somebody else did it . You 'd better start moving . I don 't know anything about a telex . And by my account , you 've got 55 minutes . Yeah , well ... I 'm in charge . And I drive one big bulldozer , my friend . And I 'm going to have Williams , his wife and your pet poodle by noon tomorrow . And if you get in my way , you 're going to be a bloody rag on one of the tracks . Maybe ... And maybe you thought you 'd have them before the sun went down today . If you want to keep your pension and those tin stars , you stay the hell out of my way . I 'm surprised at you , General . Removing evidence from the scene of a federal crime . You could get 15 years . Thanks for the drink , Mister . Evening , Harlan . - How did you know it was me ? - You 've got your own way of walking . I 'm here to relieve you . - I 'm fine . - No , you 're not . You 're plumb tuckered out . You need some sleep . - You promise to wake me in an hour ? - Two hours . Deal ? Deal . Terry ... Are they going to catch us ? I don 't know . People in the Shop used to say John Rainbird was the best field operative that ever lived . Me , I always thought Andrews was better . They could catch us . Yeah . What happens then ? Well ... I 'm history . That 's number one . That 's a big immutable . And Gina ? I think the odds are good your wife will also cease to exist . Ever thought of maybe turning yourself in ? - Turn myself in ? - They might find a way to reverse it . They don 't know what they did in the first place . How can they reverse it ? Well , Todhunter is crazy , but he does know what he did , or he will . Even if he could , do you really think he would ? Do you ? No . I think he 'd do tests . I think he 'd watch you . Wait for it to be over . One way or the other . And what if it goes all the way to the end ? What happens to Harlan Williams then ? Will I turn back into a child again ? Do I get to be one month old ? A day old ? Do I get to be a preemie in an incubator somewhere ? And then die ? I 'm never going back , Terry . Not unless someone gets lucky and throws a halter over me . And if they don 't get lucky ? Then I get lucky . And they take me back on a cooling board . Now , go on . Get some sleep . Dr Todhunter . We 'll have the old man by tomorrow night . - I 'll believe it when I see it . - You will . Well , here are his medical records . They 're for your eyes only . Where did you get these ? Does it matter ? You wanted them , you got them . - What 's happening with the mouse ? - Nothing . Good night . Good night . Time is running short , my friend . You 're not safe here . You understand that , don 't you ? You 're all I have right now . My only living record , until we find the janitor . You 'll be comfortable at my house . We 'll even bring along a couple of your girlfriends . I thought you 'd like that . What the hell is going on ? My deputies told me you 're moving out of here . Lock , stock and barrel . We 're relocating the command centre back to the base . But these are civil crimes that have taken place in my jurisdiction . - I don 't see ... - A doctor was killed at Falco Plains . - Are they connected ? - Maybe . - In what way ? - Sorry . That 's classified . Classified ? This has become a matter of national security . I 've been ordered by Washington to take over the investigation . Sheriff Mayo , I 'm ordering you to turn over any evidence you may have . Say , within the hour . Is that a problem ? No . Naturally , we 'd like to have you working with us . - Doing what ? - We 'll let you know . I think you just did . It stopped , Father . After a while , they always stop . Anyway , I brought it , Father . Just the same , because ... you were the one who told me , because you were the one who let me in on the secret . That time is short . Time ... is very , very , very ... very short . But it 's all we have . Of course . Isn 't that true , Father ? That time is all we have ? I love you , Father . But it was a great relief to me ... all the same , you know . When your time ran out . Good night , Father . Okay , that 's fine . - What 's going on , Rick ? - I 'm sorry , Sir . I can 't let you out . - I 've been given orders . - Get out of the way . I 'm sorry , Sir . I can 't . You 're restricted to base . - Get the hell out of the way . - Please . - I have my orders . - I 'm coming through . You understand , Sir , I will carry them out . - When I say " three " , we all lift . - Watch your back . - My back 's just fine . - One , two , three . Well , let 's hit the road . - Are you okay , darling ? - Yes . I 'm just tired . Wait . There 's something we have to talk about . I want to suggest something to you . It 's hard to explain , because the lines are so thin . What lines ? The lines between civil and national law . Between state and local jurisdiction And I guess , what you 'd call " eminent domain " . Maybe you 'd just better explain your idea . We beat them out of Falco Plains . We beat them out of New York State . I don 't want to know how close it was , but today , they 're going to be out in full force . Police , FBI , Shop agents . DSA operatives , maybe even the National Guard . You 're saying we don 't have a chance now . I 'm saying Harrisburg is 40 miles away . We can make it that far . How much further , I 'm not sure . What do we do then ? We find a shopping mall , we go into the biggest department store there and you two start to shoplift . - We do what ? - Shoplift . Get the stuff expensive enough to lift you out of the misdemeanour category . Oh , yes . I see . Good for you , dear , because I haven 't the foggiest . - Explain it . - Okay . The best thing for you to take is some piece of electronic equipment . Something small , but fairly expensive . One of those CD players . You , Gina ... I ask to try on a couple of high-priced dresses and when I come out of the changing booth , I only have one , as I 've hidden the other under my clothes . That 's good . But do it clumsily enough to be noticed . Then wait and as soon as you get out the doors , the security guys will hit you . - And we hit back . - That 's right . Mess them up . I don 't see what you two are excited about . You said we had to get away and now we have to get caught ? Explain . You 'd be taken in by the civil authorities . Don 't you see ? You and Gina would be behind bars . But not behind Shop bars . - And then ? - You use your one phone call . You get a lawyer . You tell him everything . Everything . - Nobody 's going to believe us . - Not at first . But you can convince them of one thing . No bail , under any circumstances . And then you get him to postpone the hearing , until he can see what 's happening . Until everyone can see what 's happening . But what about you ? I think if I hang around , it could be hazardous to my health . Extremely hazardous . Come on . We should go . You 're late . - What time is it ? I 'm bushed . - Get un-bushed . Do it in a hurry . - An hour of sleep is all I got . - Forget about it . You can sleep later . You 're here because this situation is not under control . - Are we online yet ? - Yes , Sir . Two minutes ago . They 've gone to ground . That 's all . Don 't worry . We 've got 150 agents , from Pennsylvania to Upstate New York . We 'll have another 150 by noon . There will not be a problem . I assure you . Your assurances cut no ice with me , Fredericks . We have one hell of a problem here . You don 't know how bad this could be . I don 't understand what you 're so upset about . You ought to get down on your knees and thank whatever god you believe in they 're not spilling their guts . - Who the hell would believe them ? - Who ? Anyone who saw it happening , that 's who . Terry 's not stupid . What if she decides to have this janitor locked up by some podunk sheriff ? Why would she ? To keep him from us long enough to make this look like something else , besides the UFO story . At first , no one would believe what 's happening , but if it should take us some time , Todhunter said he could change . And then Harlan Williams finds himself in one great big lively media circus . The guy who got an accidental drink at the fountain of youth . And now the big bad feds are chasing him , wanting to lock him up . Some nice old folks with grey hair and bad arthritis might find that a little annoying , don 't you think ? - Yeah . - It has to be us . - We have to get him back . - And do what with him ? Put him in Todhunter 's hands . He 's the only one who really understands what Williams means . But you know what you want , right ? You want Terry . That 's right . I want Terry . More than anything I 've ever wanted in my whole life , I want her . All right . Let 's say we get arrested and taken into custody . What 's the downside ? I can see by your face there is one . Lee Harvey Oswald . That 's the downside . I don 't understand . If they decide they can 't get Harlan back , before what 's happening leaks out , they may decide to stop it from happening . Oswald was no Dillinger , shot while running down an alley . He was shot in a police garage . While he was in police custody . But the man that shot Oswald , that Jack Ruby ... He was crazy . Plenty of people thought he was sent to do a job . Hey , Mister . You 're a quart low on oil . All right . Sometimes , it 's easier to believe in a conspiracy than outright craziness . But it still happens . Not every guy who ever hanged himself in a cell committed suicide . I 'm just saying , it could happen . You 're saying that Harlan could get killed . But they 'd leave you alone , Gina . I 'd be dead , but they 'd leave you alone . Oh , stop that ! We 're in this together . Like everything else . - Ease off , darling . - Don 't tell me to ease off ! Gina , please . Look , we might make it to your daughter 's place in Chicago . What happens after that , I don 't know . We also might get you picked up by a police department that would lock you up tight and keep you safe . The point is , we have to choose . That 'll be 11.40 . If Jack Ruby killed the man who killed the president and the police couldn 't stop it , what chance does Harlan have , if he gets arrested for shoplifting and they decide to come after him ? If they send that man , Andrews , after him ? If they send Jude Andrews , I wouldn 't give him a snowball 's chance in hell . No matter where he was locked up . What are we standing here for ? We 're wasting daylight . Let 's not waste daylight . And when we get to Harrisburg , let 's just keep going . I 'll explain it on the way . Have a nice day . What 's going on ? - Roll down the window . - One minute . - Shut the door . - What ? Shut the door ! He 'll get out . Shut the door . What are you talking about ? They got out . Catch them ! Get him ! No . No ! I don 't think you have to worry about them , Dr Todhunter . That 's quite perceptive , for someone who 's obviously had major chromosome damage . Let me get this straight . There are two lab animals missing . - That appears to be the case . - You don 't know where they are ? No , Sir . - Were they taken ? - It 's possible , Sir . Possible . I like that answer . It 's also possible I could dislocate your shoulder . I don 't know where they are , Sir . - Could they have gotten loose in here ? - That could 've happened . But even if they did , they 'd still be in this room . They couldn 't have gotten through the walls . They 're metal . Hey ... Did you see any loose animals running around in here ? In here ? - Yeah . - No . Just those two out by the fence this morning . - You did ? - Yeah . Can you show me where ? Even better . I 've got them in my locker . You do ? I was going to make bookends out of them . I 'm not going to get in trouble for this , am I ? No . Not at all . Harlan didn 't think anyone would mind if I was picking up dead animals . You see , I 'm studying this home taxidermy course . - I 'm learning to stuff animals . - Harlan ? - Harlan Williams ? - Yeah . We work together . Can you show me these mice , Billy ? - Like , now ? - Like now would be fine . Sure . Oh , my God . Look . Aren 't you going to stop , Terry ? - How bad is he hurt ? - I think he broke his leg . What happened ? I 'll stay here with them . You two go for help . My brother ... He 's already gone . Thank you . - Well , then . We can be on our way . - We can 't leave them . - There 's nothing we can do for him now . - I 'm not going to leave them here . I want you two to get in the car . - Where is he hurt ? - He broke his leg . I 've got a first aid kit in the car . Ambulance is on the way . You 'll be just fine , son . - There . - You witness the accident ? No . We just stopped to see if we could help . But everything seems to be under control . Officer , could you move your car ? We have to get going . We 're late . I brought some water . For the boy . Thank you , Ma 'am . Mother , why did you get out of the car ? The officer is going to move his car , so we can get going . Why did you get out of the car ? - I just thought ... - No . You didn 't think . - I 'm sorry . - What 's done is done . Get in . - You 're right . I didn 't think . - Never mind . But if you 've got a rosary , now would be a good time to kick it into overdrive . - Three , four , Sergeant . - Three , four Sergeant is en route . We have a situation here . I need some backup on the circle road . Send a unit . Get out of the car with your hands up now ! I 'm going to count to three , then open fire . One , two ... Hands up . Where 's the girl ? Don 't move . Put the gun down . Very slowly . Easy . Easy . Nice . - How the hell did you do that ? - Magic . You 're not going to hurt him . Not if I don 't have to . And I hope next time , if we have a next time , you 'll consider staying put when I ask you to . Where did you get the facelift , Gramps ? You wouldn 't want one . What the hell is this ? - What happened ? - Some fugitive stole my cruiser . - Stole your cruiser ? - They handcuffed me to this hearse . They handcuffed you to the hearse . Will you stop repeating everything I say and take off my shoe ? - You hurt your foot ? - I 've got a spare key in my shoe . You 've got a spare key in your shoe . Tyler ... Do you mind ? Stole your cruiser ... Damn .

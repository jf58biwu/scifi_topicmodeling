 # Workin ' at the car wash , yeah # # Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa # # Car wa ... # Hey , think quick . ( Laughs ) Thank you . Richard , nice shot . Go , team ! ALL : Go , Bucks ! Look at those guys . They got everything . Speed , women , championship trophies . Women . Pituitaries the size of guavas The point is , it got them where they are- - Where we should be . What are you talking about ? I don 't want to play basketball . I want to play basketball . I think it 's time for a change . We don 't belong here . This is ridiculous . Everyone at Farber High has the right to try out for the school team . It says so in the manual . We 're not everyone . - We 're two shemps who can 't play . - ( Blows Whistle ) All right , Gentlemen , listen up . These tryouts are to determine if any of you are worthy enough to join the ranks of the Buccaneers . I 'm here to tell you you 're not good enough . - ( Whispering ) Yes , I know . - None of you are . Your job is twofold : to try out and to prove me wrong . - Yeah ? - When do we get our jackets ? When and if you make the team . Personally , I wouldn 't hold my breath . ( Blows Whistle ) Form lines ! Gary , it 's not too late to bail . Fake a nosebleed . I 'll carry you out . No , man . Be cool . I 've taken care of everything . I don 't understand . Go , Gary ! Go , Wyatt ! Take it to the boards ! All right , let 's go ! What is Lisa doing here ? I don 't want to be zapped into some ten-foot freak . Just shut up and dribble . Watch closely , muchachos . Maybe you 'll pick up a few pointers . What did you ask her for , total humiliation ? I told Lisa to get us on the team . Hold it . Hold it . In my 30 years of coaching , never have I seen such play . Let me see that again , son . Are you just going to sit there ? Young man , that was poetry- - the arc the roll , the bounce- - and your dribbling was brilliant . It 's move like that that can carry a team to victory . Congratulations , men . Welcome to the team . Yes ! - Hi . How are you ? - Hi . How are you ? You could fit the entire chess club in this jacket . It 's not the jacket , my friend . It 's the man inside . A farber High Buccaneer . Walk tall- - or in your case just give the illusion of height . See ? We are ten feet down the hall and we already have our own adoring fans . Hello , ladies . Hi . We just wanted to , you know welcome you guys to the team . It 's , um , funny how we never really noticed you guys before . Are you girls b-ball fans ? Fans ? We 're co-captions of the a-squad . Cheerleaders . Well , well , what a coincidence . Already we have so much in common . Mr. Donnelly , may we see your quiz , please ? Don 't you think you should correct it first ? Mr. Barone understands how important it is - to keep the team G.P.A. ' s up . - But I usually get A 's . Don 't get greedy , son or I 'll have him grade it for real . Saved a seat for you two boys at the varsity table . Coach , Can I ask you a question ? Anything . What is it exactly that you like about our basketball playing ? We 're short , we can 't dribble and we shoot nothing but air balls . Your modesty is admirable , Mr. Donnelly . Clearly , you boys are gifted . Besides , I 've always felt there 's too much emphasis placed on getting the ball through the hoop . Gentlemen , make room . The future of Farber basketball has arrived . Howdy , fellow Buccaneers . - WYATT : Hello . - Good grief . Is that all the greens they gave you ? Here . There 's going to be hell to pay in that kitchen . So ... you guys tried the oatmeal scotchies ? - They really weigh a guy down . - Listen up . Now , I don 't know how , but the Coach has lost it . If you two doorsteps show up at that game friday you 're going to be crawling home . You 're not going to keep us from taking another championship . Got it ? Has anyone told you your nostrils flare when you 're angry ? Personally , I think that 's good advice . Think about it , Wy . They pull anything , and they 're off the team . The Coach loves us . We 're bulletproof . Yup , for once , Lisa delivered . I 'll get to the point- - Your cheers reek . " Lean to the left lean to the right ... " Who writes this stuff ? If we 're going to yell bad rhymes let 's at least make them honest . That 's her . Excuse me , miss . Perhaps you 're under the mistaken impression that you can just waltz into my school and displace my head cheerleader . I don 't know who you think you are ... But you 're very excited about the new changes on the squad . But I 'm very excited about the new changes on the squad . You looked forward to hearing the new cheers you 've written . I look forward to hearing the new cheers I 've written . - Carry on . - Carry on . ANNOUNCER : Fellow Buccaneers , give it up for the reigning states champions , Farber All Stars . Listen to the crowd , Wyatt . They love us . They love us . Kill us later . Once they see us play , we 're dead . Who said anything about playng ? Ow ! Oh ! My knee ! - You hurt , Mr. Wallace ? - I heard something pop - but I 'm sure I 'll be okay . - You got guts , kid . Under the pain of injury that upper lip 's as stiff as a hardwood plank . - I 'm benching you . - Aw , Coach . That patella will carry us to the state championship if it stays healthy . Beside , we got Mr. Donnelly to pick up the slack . Sorry , Coach . Uh , groin pull . Ooh . - Yeah . I heard something pop . - Tough break . Somebody get this boy 's groin iced pronto ! See ? We 're basketball stars , Wy , without even touching the ball . How are my varsity bench warmers ? Lisa , what are you doing here ? Why are you dressed like a cheerleader ? I came to see you play , and it 's head cheerleader . Isn 't Kelly head cheerleader ? All right , girls , let 's get into formation just like we practiced . - Ready ? - ALL : Okay . Deodorant is not enough when our boys go strut their stuff . Our team gets sweatly , stinky , smelly , skanky , crusty , sticky reeeeally ranky ! You know I wrote that . ( Blows Whistle ) ( Buzzer ) Yes ! All right ! Whoo ! Your knee , remember ? - Forget my knee . I want to play - What do you mean , play ? - The crowd 's not cheering for us . For those guys- - the ones playing- - and I want a piece of that action . The piece where you get publicly humiliated or the piece where they break every bone in your body ? You 're just cranky 'cause your nads are on ice . I don 't plan on getting anywhere near that ball . Everything goes to Gary . Set up Gary . Pass to Gary . Everybody clear the lanes for Gary , got it ? - You mean this Gary ? - Get out there and follow Gary 's lead . Tie a nice ribbon on it for me . Joining the game is number 11 Gary Wallace . - He 's dead man . - Hey , number 11 , you smell more like number two . ( Laughing ) Good move , Coach . Send in the girls . ( Whistle Blows ) Give it to Gary . Give the ball to Gary . Gary , take it down . That 's it , that 's it . Go down . Come on , Gary . It 's all right , Gary . Get it back . Absolutely well-done . That 's it , that 's it . Gary ! Get it to Gary ! Yes ! Get the ball to Gary ! Get it to Gary ! Shoot it ! Yes ! Shoot it , Gary ! Yes ! Yes ! That 's it . Go down . Come on , Gary . It 's all right , Gary . ( Buzzer ) Absolutely well-done . Good shot ! COACH : Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh . ( Crowd Booing ) Chin up , Mr. Wallace . Great effort . I 'm sorry that the team let you down . Man , whoever told you you could play ball ? This boy has more talent than you and the rest of this team twice over . You clean out your locker because you , sir , are off this team . That 's the last I want to hear about this matter . Coach , a word . Do you think it was wise to send Wallace into the game ? The boy 's ... how should I put this ? Uh , athletically challenged . Nobody talks about my boys that way ! No one ! I 'm sorry you had to see that . It 's not my fault we lost the game . I just went out there and gave it my best . - The team let me down . - You heard the coach . Yeah , I heard the coach- - Babbling like a lunatic under Lisa 's spell . How 's that groin pull , Ice man ? Bodacious cheers at the game , ladies . Thanks . Quit the team . We 're asking nicely . We 're not . Quit the team . Now . I don 't know . The coach is awfully fond of us . Look , we 're not going to let you two bonaduces flush our championship down the toilet . - Get the picture ? - Absolutely . Think you could have caved in a little faster , Wyatt ? - Sorry . - I 'm not quitting . - And nobody can make me . Nobody . - To put it simply ... I want you to withdraw from the Buccaneer Roster . - You mean quit ? - That 's putting it even simpler- - Yes . Now try and see this from my perspective . Should the Farber Regin that we 've enjoyed for five championship seasons suddenly come to a halt our Coach Armstrong could very possibly end up being ... someone else 's Coach Armstrong . But everybody loves the guy . More specifically ... everybody loves a winner . And I 'm not going a victorious Coach over the likes of you . - Principal Scampi ... - If perchance I do , suffice it to say that your life here at Farber will be full of ... surprises . There . You see that ? You shut your eyes a split second before you shot . You can 't teach that . Mr. Wallace I 'm going to be coaching in the summer leagues and I 'd be honored if you 'd assist me . You , too , Mr. Donnelly as soon as that groin 's 100 % . What do you say ? - We 're quitting the team . - Quitting ? - We have to . Sorry , Coach . - But why ? I don 't know how to put this , except to say when it comes to basketball , Mr. Blow . Mr. Wallace ... Gary ... I 've been a winning coach most of my career . I thought that 's what basketball was all about- - winning play out there you 've shown me a new dimension to this game and that dimension of heart . You got a heart as big as all outdoors , Gary . If you quit this team now ... I don 't see any reason for me to continue in basketball . Well , that wasn 't so bad . I 'm not quitting . Come again ? I can 't let him down . Didn 't you hear him ? No one 's believed in me like that before . No one . If the Coach had his own brain back that speech would have sounded a whole lot different . I 'm a basketball player , Wyatt , and basketball players play basketball . ( Crowd Chanting ) Go , Buccaneers ! Go , Buccaneers ! Go , Buccaneers ! Go , Buccaneers ! Cheep up , Wyatt . Maybe he won 't show . He had that " I 'm going to do something stupid " look in his eye . - What 's the game plan , Coach ? - I don 't know . I don 't care . It 's just a game . None of it matters anyway . ( Chanting Silences ) ( Shoes Squeaking ) Gary . I knew I could count on you . Listen to that , son . That 's all for you . All right , everybody ! We 're back in business . It 's Gary game , just like last week . Go , Gary ! Go , Gary ! Go , Gary , go ! Come on , Wyatt . Where 's your school spirit ? ( Whistle Blows ) - You going to be okay , son ? - Yeah . Maybe I should sit out a while . I need you more than ever . Only down 21 , two minutes left . Look , I know you 're tired but remember , kid- - you got heart . And it 's beating like a rabbit . This is too painful . We should do something . What " We ' ? You 're the wonder genie . All right , but I 'm not going to do it alone . Do you have that computer game ? Pop in the basketball cartridge . Gary will respond to every command . What 's your skill level ? I just made level eight . Then that 's how good Gary will play . It 's up to you now , Wyatt . The football game worked Basketball , football , it 's all in the thumbs . Is kicking legal ? It is in this game . All right ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! All right , Gary , wonderful job ! Absolutely well-done . Come on , Gary . That 's it , Gary . ( Electrical Buzzing ) - What happened ? - Oops . I think I over-amped its circuits . - Fix it . Gary 's all alone out there . - Wait . He 's doing okay . COACH : Come on , Gary . That 's it , go down . ( Buzzer ) ( Whistle Blowing ) How did I do , Coach ? Still proud of me ? Coach ? You may have won the game but that was some of the sloppiest ball handling I 've ever seen . You 're still shy of varsity material . But like I said ... you got heart , son . - Thanks , Coach . - Just keep it off my court . Hey , ladies . How are you ? - This is my friend Wyatt . - GIRLS : Hi . I owned the court did you see me ? - Yeah , I saw you . - I am the master . Look who we have here . Captain Toe Jam and the bench-sucking butt boy . - Leave him alone . - Ooh , pom-pom girl . Give me a " T. " Give me an " A. " Just give me five minutes . I 'll give you much more . Now you 're giving me something to cheer about . ( Chett Groaning ) You guys up for a little kickball ? - Sure . - Okay . Captioned by Grantman Brown

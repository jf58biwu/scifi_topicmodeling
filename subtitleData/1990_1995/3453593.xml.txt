 I 'm thinking we continue this conversation another time . - At night ? Over dinner ? - I was thinking the same thing . How about , um , Sunday ? Ooh , I made the weekend lineup . - It 's a date . - See you then . - How 'd you land Linda Hobbs ? - I turned on the Wallace charm and she thinks being seen with a dweeb will - make her ex-boyfriend jealous . - You have no pride . Which brings me my next question- - loan me 30 bucks . You still owe me from the fifth grade . Ho-ho money doesn 't count . Come on . Why ask me ? Ask Lisa . - I can 't . I already owe her 7,000 . - For what ? You think this hair styles itself ? Here 's a thought- - why not earn the money . I do earn the money . Look . I 'm groveling . I 'm pleading . It 's not that easy . Or trying winning the money . Talent shows are for feebs . - First prize is 200 bucks . - I 'm in . What can you do ? I can drink soup through my nose . - Anything else ? - I can trick belch . Shave my back without a mirror . Edwin Mueller tried that last year . - It wasn 't pretty . - Who am I kidding ? My talents are freak talents . I suck at everything else . Don 't be so hard on yourself . I like your talents . - Come on , belch my name . - For 30 bucks . Maybe you need a partner . We could team up . - I 've got a special talent . - Great . I 'll crab walk , you name the state capitals . Nope . I 'm talking about my other special talent . Ladies and gentlemen ! I am the amazing Wyatt ! Master of the endless hanky . Abracadabra ! Sleight of hand , you say ? An illusion , you ask ? No . - Magic . - Make him stop . You there , good sir . Care to pull my ring ? - Care to pull my finger ? - Come on , Gar . Play along . Forget it . This is seriously lame . What did you think ? I liked the music . CHETT : Yoo-hoo , little brother ! [ Sucking Sound ] Well , if it isn 't the incredible wimpini . I love this act . Weren 't the hankies amazing ? - I can 't get enough . - Chett , we 're busy . Want to see some real magic , Wallace ? Watch this . Nothing here . Nothing here . # Ta-da da-da-da-da-da-da # # Ta-da da-da-da-da # Ta-da ! Disappearing allowance . How does he do it ? Sure , you give him money . - So , did I miss anything ? - Yeah . - The show actually picked up there . - You 're kidding ? Wyatt , I hate to break it to you but magic is for losers . Wyatt , why don 't you try some of these - really cool tricks in the back . - Yeah , like " The Floating Skull . " - Or " The Yodeling Skull . " - There 's a reason they 're in the back of the book . - It takes years to master them . - Well , I know some magic . - Maybe I can help . - Hey , that 's it ! If I had real magic powers I could win the talent show . Wait . That 's Lisa-magic . That doesn 't require talent . - I beg your pardon . - Wyatt , I don 't have any real talent . Let me use Lisa . Would you rather I snort soup ? Fine , but you 'll never know the satisfaction of pulling a quarter out of a young child 's ear . - I 'll get over it . Lisa ? - Okey-dokey . - [ Electric Volts Sizzling ] - Ooh ! I feel all ... tingly . That 's because you now have magical powers . All you have to do is look up the right magic word and you can do any trick in the book . Cool . Where should I start ? - What about this one ? - Now , that 's magic ! Shalacazam ! Hey , man , watch the hair . - [ Laughs ] - I think I found my talent . [ Playing Off-Key ] [ Horn Honks ] [ Cymbals Crash ] These tricks are awesome . There 's no way I can lose ! We . No way we can lose . We 're a team , remember . Right . Sure I can 't talk you out of doing those kiddie tricks ? They 're not kiddie tricks , they 're classics . Look , you worry about you half of the show . I 'll worry about mine . I may need some help . What do I do ? Stand perfectly still and let me cut your head off . - Huh ? - Let me cut your head off . - No ! - I say the magic word , and your head 's back on good as new . Be a bud . Let me cut you head off , please ? ! - Cut your own head off . - Fine . I don 't need your stupid head . I got something just as good . That was certainly a spirited tribute . I 'm sure the beatles would be proud . And next we have a team of magicians : Wyatt Donnelly and Gary Wallace . I don 't know if you 're aware , but I 'm somewhat of a magic buff myself . Stop by the office and I 'll show you my collection of Siegfried an Roy videos . - Okey-doke . - Whatever . Okay , you go first , and knock ' em dead . [ Russian Folk Music Playing ] I call my first trick " The Dancing Napkin . " Dance , napkin , dance ! Thank you ! And for my next trick , I need a shoe- any kind of shoe . - Ladies and gentlemen ... The amazing Wyatt ! Now , sit back , take a deep breath and prepare to be blown away . Wienie ... stick . Wienie roast ! Alla-sheem-ballah ! Oops . [ Everyone Yelling ] That was quite a little trick . Perhaps for an encore you can convince me not to expel you . I don 't understand it . You singe a few eyebrows , everyone 's on your case . I 'm sorry you 're disqualified from the show . We 'll be lucky if we don 't get disqualified from school . If I 'd cut your head off , this never would have happened . - Come on , guys . - Sorry . It 's not just the money . I really wanted to win . For the first time in my life , I have a great talent ! - Cooking wienies with your breath ? - Better than dancing napkins . Yeah ? It 's harder than it looks . I don 't care if you make a pool cover dance . - We had a shot , and we blew it . - Maybe you need another shot . Huh ? What 's with that ? - It 's your second chance . - I 'm out . - You can 't bail on Gary . - He 's the one with magic powers . - Why does he need me ? - Good question . Don 't break up the team . You could be great together . Gary may have the real magic but you 've got style and showmanship . It 's what 's you need . Okay . I 'm in . Wy ? Come on , man . This is my shot . If I could be a winner just one night I can live with being a no-talent dork the rest of my life . - Okay ... partners . - Great . - But no costumes . - We got to have costumes ! - GARY : But no sequins . - Just on the hats . Done . - Hey , where 's the book ? - Don 't need it . Got it all in here . [ Lukewarm Applause ] [ Drum Roll ] Ladies and gentlemen ! I am the amazing Wyatt ! And I am Gary , the wicked awesome ! - [ Fanfare Playing ] - Meet our lovely assistant Lisa ! - [ Drum Roll ] - [ Fanfare Playing ] [ Hooting and Hollering ] Ours is not a traditional magic act . Before your eyes , you will witness these spectacular feats of prestidigitation handed down through the ages . All in just 30 seconds . WYATT : First , Gary , the wicked awesome will perform a - stunning display of mind reading . - Zoe-allah ! You hate Broccoli , Rayon and your brother 's second wife . He 's right ! Unbelievable . Next , an astounding demonstration of ... - hypnosis . - Shinola ! - You 're a duck ! - Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! - Amazing . - Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Quack ! Finally , a card trick ... with a twist ! Pardon me , ma 'am . Is that a royal flush up your nose ? Sim-sim-ballah-bim ! How does he do it ? Thank you . You 've been a great audience . - But wait ! There 's more ! - There 's more ? That 's right- - " The Lightning Round . " - What are you doing ? - We 're on a roll . Go with me . I say these magic words- - - Budda-bing ! - [ Audience Screams ] Budda-bang ! Budda-boom ! Yo ! back here ! Untoasted . Gary Wallace ! That was quite a show . It reminded me of siegfried and Roy 's " Rhinestone Tiger Tour . " - Principal Scampi . - You act is really coming together . It 's stylish , provocative and , uh ... No longer a fire hazard . I 've never seen anyone perform " The Arabian Swordsman " with such skill . Thanks . You know the swordman trick ? The magician 's handbook , page 417 . You know it take some people 20 years to master that trick ? You must be some sort of idiot savant . What can I say ? I 'm talented . I 'm throwing a dinner party tonight . I 'd love to have you perform . There 'd be some money in it for you . Gee , I don 't know . This is sort of a one-shot deal . I 'd hate to suspend such a promising young magician but there was a great deal of fire damage . - What time ? - Be there around 9 : 30 . And , uh , lose the hat . Got a minute , Svengali ? Look at this ! We were great ! I particularly enjoyed the surprise lightning round when you whacked me in half and made Lisa disappear . - Come on , they loved it . - Gary , you don 't get it . - Lisa 's still gone . - She is ? Yeah ! Now say the magic word that bring her back . - Um ... sure . - You don 't remember , do you ? Don 't panic . It 's in the book ! We 'll go to your house and look it up . I hope it 's that easy . I got a bad feeling about this . - [ Tearing Noises ] - [ Thud ] Don 't just stand there . Get a wheelbarrow . Okay , it 's clear . [ Grunting ] Ease up on the choke hold , will you ? [ Groans ] - [ Knocking ] - Who 's that ? It 's me . Open the door . I got to take a whiz . - You 're welcome . - [ Sighs ] Whew . Okay , so where 's the book ? - [ Knocking ] - CHETT : Butt-lick . You in there ? - What 's up , Chett ? - I need new tires for my jeep . That should do it . Chett . That 's a VCR . As soon as I sell it it will be 15 inches of mud-gripping quad-traction tire . You got a problem with that ? No problem . [ Toliet Flushing ] Excuse me . Okay . Here it is . " The vanishing vixen . To summon those once banished from sight say this word once into the night . " They sure don 't make this easy . Meph-o-sto-pheles ? [ Roaring ] At last ! After 10,000 years , I 'm free ! Free to take my revenge against the pitiful human race ! [ Evil Laughter ] That 'll probably come back to haunt us . You must have mispronounced the magic word . Try again . Gary , the book ! It 's torched ! I may be stuck like this forever . We may never get Lisa back . - Scampi 's got a copy . - What ? We 'll get it tonight when we 're at his house . Problem solved . [ Thumbing ] Do you mind ? Here 's the plan . You search the house . I 'll stall as long as I can . - Right . - Wait ! Am I showing ? Hold on . There . You 're golden . And the milk has vanished ! Thank you . How many of you enjoyed farm-fresh eggs this morning ? Show of hands . I know I did . In fact , I must have swallowed a whole carton . Wyatt , a word . Principal Scampi . Enjoying the show ? No . As a matter of fact ... I find it phenomenally painful to watch . Where 's your partner ? Why aren 't you doing those show-stoppers I saw before ? We can 't do that exact same act . We 're not prepared . Uh ... our beautiful assistant , she 's home with the flu and ... we forgot to bring the sword . Sure you did . Oh . What luck . Gary , hi . Did you find it okay ? No . I searched everywhere . I combed this place inside the out . I looked upstairs , downstairs , even the attic . - There 's no sign of it . - The bathroom ? Down the hall two doors just past the library . - You have a library ? - Where were you looking ? Gary , the wicked awesome will be taking over the show . Whatever you do , no magic . Just stall . Well , now I 've got a real magician . Say , how about a repeat performance of that spectacular arabian swordman 's trick ? Uh , sure . As soon as Wyatt comes back . I understand that loyalty but let 's face it- - Your partner bites and my guests are getting restless . Tell you what . I 'll be your assistant . You can cut me in half . After all , what lad could resist the opportunity to slice his principal in two ? Why is it never easy ? Come on . Chop away . Principal Scampi , I can 't hack , hack , hack . We have to build up to that moment . Oh , of course . Showmanship . Carry on . Ladies and gentlemen you are about to witness one of the baddest most awesome feats of magic ever attemped . Who has a bowl of soup ? [ Slurping ] Ta-da ! Now for my next trick I will fold my body and walk like a crab . And for my next fantastic feat I will belch a pearl Jam Medley . [ Guest Groaning ] Mr. Wallace , this is not a locker room . I believed the mood has been sufficiently set . Cut me in half so we can get on with dessert . Let 's , uh ... let 's make it interesting . Take a little off the top . - I 've got the book ! - Donnelly , what 's going on ? Here 's the word . Don 't blow it . - Mephostopheles ? - [ Growling ] [ Growling ] You dare to summon me dare ? I shall turn this soiree into an orgy of blood ! - [ Laughing ] - [ People Screaming ] [ Growls ] Ladies and gentlemen , you 've just witnessed Gary , the demon slayer ! The latest addition to our act . - Thank you and good night . - That ... was spectacular ! Good work , Gary , the wicked awesome . You got a real talent there . Couldn 't have done it without you , Wy . - [ Cloth Tearing ] - [ Thumb ] - [ Grunts ] - The topper ! I 'll get the wheelbarrow . Mm-hmm . Lisa , when you disappeared where did you go ? I was transported to a dark corner - of the fifth astral plane . - Wow . - What was it like ? - A little muggy . - LISA : So what did I miss ? - We conjured a demon . Gary sucked soup through his nose . - I missed the soup trick ? - As much as I 'd like to wow you with a repeat performance I have a date . Have fun . Linda , good news- - I got plenty of cash . We can do anything . I 've got good news too . When I told my ex-boyfriend we were dating he got so jealous , we got back together thanks to you . Just one of my many talents . Sim-sim-salabim .

 Rocketed from a distant planet , to a bold new destiny on Earth , found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent , he learned he possessed the strength of steel , the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind . He is Superboy ! [ music playing ] [ Lana grunts ] Luthor , let her go ! I 'm the one you want . The game 's over , Luthor . The games have just begun . It 's a trap ! What else is new ? Gotcha , sucker . No ! Lana , run ! Out of my way . Luthor ! Luthor . Lana . Lana . Wake up ! Luthor , snap out of it . Get the Kryptonite away from me . Throw it so I can move this thing . Go . Luthor , crawl out . Help me . Bombs away . [ laughing ] You 're dead meat , Superboy . A dead duck . Dead as a dodo . Look around , Luthor . If I 'm dead , you 're dead , too . - Shut up . - We 're trapped . I said shut up . [ gasping ] Move it or I 'll die . Well , that 's the idea . You need my help . Of course , you 're right . How silly of me . What can I do for you , boss ? Get the Kryptonite as far away from me as you can . Right . The best I can do . The place is kind of tiny . And now , your highness . [ panting ] Let 's just hope Lana made it out . Because she 'll bring help . Oh , goody . I 've got a plan . Do you now ? Me too . I plan to have some fun . For God 's sake , Luthor . [ laughs ] You 're out of your mind , Luthor . Perhaps we 'll play some Kryptonite dodgeball . You think this is all a game ? You can die in here , too . Do you have me enough to die ? Let me see . How do I hate thee ? Let me count the ways . I hate that dull look of integrity in your eyes . I hate your moronic pretty boy charm . I hate ... I hate that damn curl in the middle of your forehead . I hate your feebleminded glaze of honesty , goodwill . Bottom line , I hate you 'cause you 're hate me . You 're scum , Luthor . But I don 't hate you or anybody else . You hate me when I do this . Oh ! Now do you hate me , huh ? [ blows raspberries ] How about if I do this ? This is the way it 's supposed to be . Man to man . Fight to the death . You know , I 've waited my whole life for this . Go on . Kill me . Kill me ! If you don 't kill me , I 'll kill you , you stupid spineless weakling simp . Murder me ! [ screams ] Superboy ! [ echoes ] [ laughing ] Now that was worth the price of admission . I haven 't had so much fun since I drowned my little sister 's kittens . You think you won that round ? Well , I 'm still alive . Why , you think you won ? Of course I did . How do you figure ? You 're still alive . You should have killed me when you had the chance . You don 't think I would love to kill you , Luthor , to crush you like a bug ? But I 've got values and rules . And the second I compromise them is the second I become a monster like you . The crushing responsibility of superpower . You make me wanna puke . There 's no air in here . You 're running out of oxygen . The lanterns are burning it up . You 're finally getting scared , huh ? Maybe I 'll just jam this down your throat , huh ? You think you can threaten your way out of here . We 're trapped . What happens if they don 't get us out in time ? You can either work with me or die . Work with you ? I could take all the Kryptonite and shove it to the farthest corner of this stinkin ' hole . It wouldn 't be far enough away to restore your powers . The place is too small ! I saw some batteries on the way in . If we can get to them , break them open , we can use the lead to shield the Kryptonite . Then I can get us out . How far in are these lead batteries ? I 'm not sure . My vision 's cloudy , obstructed . OK , I 'll make you a deal . - I help you dig , you let me go if we get out . - No way . Yeah , well , there 's no way I 'm going to the chair . That 's the chance you 'll have to take . This game was your call . [ rocks falling ] Maybe I 'll just burn that bridge when I come to it . What a waste . Keep digging . I mean you . You could have had it all . Money , power , women , anything . If you just had the guts to reach out and take what you want . That 's not what I want . Well , what do you want ? To make the world a better place . [ laughs ] [ coughs ] Oh , God , you 're so like a greeting card . So that 's why you 're wasting your ability ? To save the world ? The world isn 't worth it . It is worth it . People are worth it . People are slime . Everyone blubbers about kindness and good will and then quietly looks out for number one . Dig . Compassion 's a little too expensive for the average Joe . Survival of the fittest is the name of the game . It 's the law of the jungle and everyone knows it . That 's what every psychotic since Hitler used to justify himself . Shut up and dig . Our lucky day . Jackpot . There 's no lead in here . It 's just some kind of carbon alloy . Lana 's our only hope . [ grunting ] [ coughs ] This is a hell of a way to cash in your chips . You know , you never really answered my question . Huh ? What did you want ? I mean , for yourself . More than anything else ? Yeah . For you to stop bothering me . [ laughs ] Looks like you 're finally gonna get your wish . Come on , for old time 's sake . What did you really want ? An ordinary life . What , you mean a house in the ' burbs ? A wife , kids and station wagon ? The freedom to compromise . I 've heard of aspiring to mediocrity , but this is ridiculous . How about you ? What did you want more than anything else ? To be king for a day . And that would make you happy ? Happiness is for pigs . The secret of joy is absolute power . [ shouts ] It 's gonna come down . I wonder if ... the spots . They don 't change . What are you talking about ? I noticed it when I first came into the mine . Noticed what ? My vision penetrates normally , except for certain spots where it 's cloudy or completely obstructed . Your visions are weakened . That 's what I thought at first , but the spots , they don 't change . They don 't shift back and forth when I move my eyes . They 're really there . This must be ... a lead mine . OK , give it all you got . Come on , you can do better than that . Beef it up . Pour on the coals . There we go . There we go . That 's it . OK , just hang in there . Hang in there . Hey , come on . You can 't give up . Think of ... think of ... think of the people you gotta save . Women , children , innocent victims . What , you 're gonna let ' em fend for themselves ? Come on ! You gonna let ' em all down ? You gonna let the bad guys win ? What am I saying ? You have a duty , a responsibility . Now fight ! Fight ! Fight ! Oh , my God . It worked . We did it . [ grunts ] We 're catching the next train out of here . And , man , you 're the locomotive . Hey , how we doing , champ ? Superboy . Hey , come on , come on . You can 't check out on me now . No fair . Come on , Superboy . Are we feeling better ? - Thanks . - Huh ? - I didn 't think you could ... - Yeah , me , neither . Come on , come on . It 's getting stuffy in here . [ inhaling ] [ shouts ] What took you so long ? Checkmate . [ laughs ] This is just too easy . I 'll tell you what . I 'll cut you the same deal . You promise to let me go , I 'll put this stuff away . I can 't do that . Oh , Supey , buddy , after all we 've been through ? Not a chance . But I 'm gonna kill you . I know . And you accept that ? You can just say you were gonna let me go and then grab me when you were safe . I can 't do that , either . Well ... you just don 't leave me much choice , do you ? I guess not . Can 't do it , can you ? [ shouts ] There . That oughta hold you a while . Turning over a new leaf ? Don 't you ever tell anyone I let you go . You 'll never win , Luthor . It matters now whether you win or lose . I 'm gonna hate myself in the morning . [ music playing ]

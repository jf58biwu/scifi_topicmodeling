Hey , you , move on . Can the phony tears . Go ! Beat it- - - Who the hell are you ? The lone ranger or somethin ' ? - Ah ! - It 's just like a human to go and try something like that . - You 're absolutely right . A , uh , a word to the wise . This place is infested with humans . Watch yourself . - I would like to give you a little something to thank you for your troubles . - I-I-I 'd be insulted , sir . This is my neighborhood . I 'm just trying to keep it safe . - Oh , Well , uh , thanks , again , friend . - my pleasure . - Thanks , again ! - The , uh , " lone ranger ? " - It worked , didn 't it ? - This time , speedy . Next time , stick to the script . - Okay . - We got a match . - Tissue and blood ? - Absolutely perfect . - I 'm sure you 'll find them all in order . The paper Trail for each body part is pretty mind-Boggling . It seems that I spend most of my time these days filling out forms . There , that does it . Wrap him up , Dora , and take him to post-Op . - Yes , doctor . - Uh , doctor , how can you tell for sure that all the organs you receive are from legitimate donors ? - I can 't . I have to rely on paperwork just like everyone else . But I haven 't had a donor call and complain yet . Ah , mrs . Vork . Now , here 's a typical example . The cliban liver needed for mrs . Vork 's operation is coming all the way from asteroid a-16- - a Miner who died in a cave-In- - But since he registered as a donor , his life , or rather death , won 't be a complete loss . It is unfortunate that in , uh , in my field , one life has to be lost before another can be gained . - Well , that 's one way to look at it , doc . - that 's the way it is . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to attend to mrs . Vork . - Well , thanks for your time , doc . - Not at all . - So , how about some lunch ? - I think I just lost my appetite . - So , what do you think , Pike ? Does our friend live in a large apartment or a small one ? - hmm . This looks like the one . - Hey ! This place is taken ! - Yeah ? Well , not for long . Oh . Oh , no ! No ! - Wirt ? Hey ! What 's going on ? - Ears , eyes , toenails ? What possible use could they have for my toenails ? - Where you been , man ? Toenail transplants are the latest craze , and yours are kinda cute . - Hey , guys , we have a 207 in progress , Paradise street , code Three . It 's right by you . Suspects left the scene in a black limo . - We 're on it , fredo . - Hey , look familiar ? - Yeah , that , or we 've got identical twins flying around town with their numbers wiped . - Oh , man . If it drops another one of those things- - This is the police . Reduce your speed and descend to ground level . - Yeah , right . - We got him this time . Brogan ! - Will you quit yelling in my ear ? - Where are you goin ' , Pike , huh ? - Brogan , I don 't think this is such a hot idea . Tracking . - You still got him ? - Yeah , I got him . Do it ! Now ! - Spectrum program interface . - damn ! I lost him . It 's like they just vanished into thin air . For all rsa units . - It was dark . They pulled a gun on me . All I know , is it was a couple of creons . - Wirt owe anybody money ? - Hey , wirt didn 't owe nobody , and nobody had it in for him . He was as clean as soap . - Yeah . So , this must be his evil twin , then , huh ? Let 's see- - Pick-Pocketing , bunko , grand larceny , Petty theft , Hopper theft . - Oh , man . I can see where This is goin ' . you ain 't gonna do zip to find out who grabbed him . Jeez . Look , for what it 's worth , wirt 's a good guy . He 's always been there for me when things have gotten tough , which is more than I can say for most humans . But that don 't matter to you , does it ? - Don 't bet on it , kid . - So , you 'll find him ? - We 're gonna try . - Yeah . Are we finished here ? - Yeah . I 'll get you a ride back . - What are you trying to do ? Ruin my rep ? I can 't be seen with people like you . Hey , bolts for brains ! - I am an rsa unit . - When 's the next shuttle back to dc ? - Twenty-Five fifteen , sir . - I 'm outta here . - Sweet kid . - So , haldane , I understand the limo pulled a vanishing act on Eagle eye himself . - Okay , so maybe I was wrong . - Okay , maybe I 'll just take that as an apology . - Dr. Jorry , what can I do for ya ? - Well , I was hoping you might be able to put my mind at ease , Rick . I had a visit from the police . They 're asking questions . They were anxious to know how and where I received my organ transplants . - and what did you tell ' em ? - I , uh , showed them the paperwork . - I see . And you 're worried that during the course of the police investigation , they 'll discover some of our donor statements are , uh , unorthodox . - in a nutshell , yes . - the paperwork is fine , doc . But there will always be an element of risk . After all , if we didn 't rob a few graves , Hey , those organs would be gone forever , along with the lives of many of your patients . - Yes , but I can 't afford any damage to my reputation . - believe me . It 's not in our interest , either . So , don 't worry about it . Now , about that liver for your cliban patient , good news . It 'll be at the space port within the hour . - Thanks . At least , that 's some good news . - talk to you soon . - tune in to channel two-Three-Nine , tonight at 13 . - Okay . So far , we 've got a dead tarn . - Minus a few essentials . - a cliban pick-Pocket snatched by a couple of creons , who most likely did the tarn , flat feet from hittin every clinic and hospital in demeter city , all of which check out to be legit , and a wiseguy kid flop artist with a mouth . - So ? - So , what ? You got an idea ? - Mmm-hmm . - You 're scary , Brogan . Final boarding for simter transport , level five . - Okay , here 's what I got on the medical import 's manifest- - One creon kidney , one creon heart , one trajin pancreas . You wanna stay with me on this ? - Uh , yeah- - right , right . - Creon kidney , creon heart , trajin pancreas . - Kidney , heart , uh , our missing persons list- - No matches . - Got a rush shipment from , uh , asteroid a-16 , a cliban liver for a dr . Paul jorry . - All right- - We 'll take it . - Earth passenger Monroe , please report to departure pad . - Okay , in the last three days , Dr. Jorry imported two consignments , three tarn kidneys , our John Doe tarn , and one cliban liver , speedy 's friend , wirt . - Which will soon be walking out of dr . Jorry 's clinic , inside of mrs . Vork . And we can 't a warrant to arrest jorry because all the paperwork is spotless . It 's all just a coincidence . - All very legal . All very smelly . We gotta turn up the heat . Get him to make a mistake . - Give me a reading on the cerebral stats . - Minus nine at the lenticular nucleus and rising . Very well- - You can take mrs . Vork to post-Op now . - Dr. Jorry is with a patient ! - Sorry , miss , but I 'm afraid you can 't see him . - Dr. Jorry ? Amanda Sparks , " demeter city times . " I 'm sorry to Barge in on you like this . It 's just , well , I 'm doing an article on organ implants , and I was hoping you might lend me your expertise for a few minutes . Well , uh , I 'm interested in any publicity , which might encourage the public to sign up as organ donors . Heaven knows we need them . And , uh , what exactly do you need to know , miss Sparks ? How many transplant operations would a clinic like this carry out in the course of a day ? Well , that varies , of course , according to the availability and the suitability of the donor . But , on a good day , we could get through between five and six . - That many- - Well , I had no idea . Now , do you specialize in just one species ? - Oh , good heavens , no . We , uh , we deal in a great many different species . - Have you ever operated on a cliban ? - Now , that is a coincidence . I 've just completed a liver transplant on a cliban patient . - Now , that 's just perfect . Do you mind , if I ask you a few questions about it ? - No- - Go- - Fire ahead . - Were you aware that a male cliban was kidnapped just last night on Paradise street ? His name was yudo wirt . - Yeah . I 'm sorry , but I , uh , fail to see the correlation . - Didn 't you just say you just performed a liver transplant on a cliban patient ? - Yes , indeed . But our donor died in an accident on asteroid a-16 and his livers were shipped immediately to my clinic . I see nothing unusual in that . - I 'm afraid there is . I have contacts on a-16 . The mining facility there hasn 't had a death for over six months . So , who really was your donor , dr . Jorry ? - I 'm sorry , but you have been misinformed . Well , if you 'll excuse me , I have much work I have to do . Thank you . - I cannot have my officers Entrapping prominent citizens , whether it be just cause or not ! Anyway you slice it , it is still entrapment . - Captain , we were just trying to stir up the hornet 's nest . - Well , you certainly managed to do that , haldane . Oh , yes . What the hell were you two thinking about , Brogan ? - Stopping a murderer before he kills , again . - You think jorry is a murderer ? - No . - Perfect . You two have really bailed up this one . - Look , captain , jorry may not be a murderer , but he 's sure as hell part of the equation ! - Well , you 're not ! Sergeant fredo , send up officers orrin and romek . - right away , sir . - Captain , wait a minute . - If jorry is involved , I don 't want him to walk , because of bogus investigating . You 've tainted this case . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from him . Go and juggle one of your other cases ! And , castle , you 're out of uniform ! And close the door ! Hmm . - Now what ? - Cover for me . I got someone I need to talk to . - Not a problem . - a reporter was here , asking about a cliban called yudo wirt . Apparently , he disappeared from Paradise Street last night . I 've had enough of this . - cool it , doc . - I 'm out ! - You 're in way too deep . - out ! - Besides , you and your lovely wife really don 't wanna lose that nice , expensive home of yours . Now , do ya , huh ? If we go down- - - You go down . Right- - Now that we have that settled , what 's the species of our next donor ? - Thank you . Thank you . - damn ! - Ah . - Thank you . - Hey , nice threads . You find wirt ? - We need to talk , speedy . - What ? Here , in broad daylight ? I mean , you 're starting to shade my rep . - Okay , then , let 's step into my office . - Hey ! - We don 't know for sure . He may still be alive . - Nope . Wirt was an expert at getting out of places . He would 've gotten in touch by now . - You guys were pretty close , huh ? - My folks walked off a colony ship , right into the tarn-Creon riots . They never had a chance ... but wirt , he saved me , raised me . - Taught you everything you know . - He did the best he could , okay ? - Yeah . I guess he did . - Hey , Brogan , everybody needs a trade . - Hi , dad . About this peanut butter , do I get a choice between smooth and crunchy ? - Um- - - You forgot , didn 't you ? - Well , no . I didn 't exactly forget . But it-It 's not very easy to find , honey . - there 's always new hawaii . - Hey , good idea . You think they have it there ? - Bye , dad . I still want that peanut butter . - Okay , honey . Bye . - Cute . For a little kid , that is . - So , what 's with the peanut butter ? - We had a deal . She gets a good grade ... - ... you cop for the peanut butter . I heard of that stuff . Never had it , though . - speedy ! Take care . Try taradeli across the street . I heard they got all that earth stuff there . Thanks- - I owe ya . - Forget it- - I owe nobody , and nobody owes me . - What can I get ya ? - I 'm lookin ' for some earth-Style peanut butter- - - Crunchy , smooth , whatever you got . - Not a chance , but I 'll get some in later . - Damn- - Uh , look , let me give you my , uh , name , address , And , uh , phone number . When you get some in , you give me a call , okay ? - got it , Mr. Brogan . - right . Thanks . - a perfect match . - Tissue and blood . - How 's the peanut butter hunt coming , dad ? - Oh , don 't ask . - I already have , right ? You know , dad , I 've been giving this peanut butter thing a lot of thought , and I don 't really care . - You don 't ? - It can be smooth or crunchy . - Come on , squirt . Let 's play tunnel dragons . Oh , dibs on zal-Kator ! - Hi . - Mmm . Hey . - why don 't you , uh , take off your clothes and join me ? - I don 't think so . - Well , you know , Brogan , it might just relax you . - Uh , maybe later . - Mmm . Suit yourself . Hey , um , did you have any luck with that peanut butter ? - not you , too . - hmm . What am I gonna do with you , Brogan ? - All right ! Oh , yeah ! Bonus round , ten more points ! - Mr. Brogan , this is your lucky night . The boss found this out back just after you left . - Ah . - Brogan ? Brogan ? Brogan ? - Give it back . It 's my turn . - No way ! I 've got one more man left . - Oh , come on- - I got the bonus round . Just let me have one game . - Find anything ? - Uh , that 's a negative , captain . - What happened ? - I don 't know . I was in the thera-Pool . I came down the hall , the door was open . The coffee was spilled . - No noise ? - No , nothing . I didn 't hear anything . - Is daddy gonna be okay ? - Oh , sure , sure . - Dad can take care of himself . - Now , listen . We 'll have some good news for you really soon . - Captain ? - What have you got ? - Mrs. Albright , who lives in the next unit , saw Brogan getting into a limo with two creon . At the parking lot in the central hub . - man , a limo and two creons ? - The leggers . - Gotta be . - You two , get back down to Paradise street . Question everybody one last time . I want that limo ! - Captain , what about jorry ? - Go for it ! Took and castle , you 're with haldane ! - You can start prepping your patient , doctor . We got a donor . - Have you removed the heart , yet ? - No , but as long as we don 't have any complications , she 'll be ready in a couple of hours . - Then , I 'd like to remove it myself . - Say , again ? - Look . Now that I know what we 're doing , I don 't have to accept poorly removed Organs any longer . - Uh , I 'm not sure , doc . - Look ! It puts my patients lives at risk . Think about it . Bottom line , it 's not good for business . - and that 's what it 's all about , doc . Sit tight . We 'll come and pick you up . - Yeah , we 're holding back , captain . We don 't want the limo pulling another disappearing act . - stay with ' em , haldane . I 'll send backup . What about the doctor ? Can we trust him ? - Well , we don 't have a choice . It 's the only way we 're gonna get to Brogan . - We 've got to try to keep a fix on him , tooky . - I 'm doing my best . - don 't delay . Call today for an rsa guided tour of this state of the art- - - I don 't believe this ! - Track the limo 's trajectory from the point where we lost them . - This doesn 't make any sense . It vanished right there . - Here 's a look at upcoming attractions on your- - - Anybody got a can opener ? - Here 's your first patient , doc . By the way , found this in his pocket . Name 's Brogan . He 's a cop . - Oh . Now , that 's a stroke of luck . Here 's the man who 's been snooping around the clinic . - Better go make sure everything in the bay is secure . - Tonight , at 13 , as the CREON community council debates the issues live . - It 's the only place they can be . - So , how do we get Brogan out , without tearing it apart ? - Come on , doc . He 's gonna be a dead man anyway . I 'm not operating on a man unless he 's properly sedated . I don 't want to risk damaging his heart . This won 't hurt a bit , lieutenant . - hurry it up , doc . - Ah ! - Ah ! - Oh ! - Ah ! - Ah ! - Oh ! - Ugh ! - Ah ! - Teshan supplementary units expert- - - No go ! I tried every code , every frequency . If it 's got a hidden entrance , I don 't know how to find it . - Ah ! Ah ! - We 're right by you . Where do you want us ? - Cover the starboard side .

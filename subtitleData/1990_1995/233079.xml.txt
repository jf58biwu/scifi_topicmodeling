 In the latter half of the Twentieth Century rapid advancements in technology at last resulted in the development of artificial substitutes for human beings . A synthesis of mechatronics , artificial intelligence , and biotechnology they freed people from all kinds of menial labor . People called these symbols of the era , " Boomers , assemblers of prosperity " . People all hold more love and dreams than they can hold with both hands and paint those dreams for tomorrow while entrusting the future to a new-falling star . If you go step by step on your own two legs , without stopping before everything your arms touch transforms into phantasms you can approach those dreams . Now begins the unending dream when you search for yourself , sleeping in the depths of your heart . Now begins the unending journey . Fix your sights on a faraway sky . I 'm glad you stopped by , Yuri . I hope you 'll tell me what you think later . My opinions don 't matter , though , do they ? You 're the one who did it , Haynes . The whole world awaits the unveiling of Adama ! We both worked under Dr. Stingray , didn 't we ? And I designed Adama from the research data he left behind , didn 't I ? I was aiming to make a Boomer more like human beings than existing Boomers one which would be a good friend of mankind , as the Doctor had hoped . A second-generation Boomer , then ... ? It 's still a little early to be calling it that . You could say that building Adama was not really serious work . Even so , the new AI you developed is amazing . It 'll probably be integral in the creation of a new human civilization centered around Boomers . That was what the Doctor hoped for . It 's laughable , isn 't it . After the Doctor died in that accident it was the opinion of the scientific world that I would be his successor . But , because of your achievements , it was not to be . Yuri , has that bothered you ? It 's a pain that a single-minded researcher like you wouldn 't understand . Even unto the end , you shall follow the same road as Dr. Stingray . Yuri ... ! Y ... Yuri ... What are you ... ? ! Give my regards to the Doctor . Fire ! Why , hello , Adama . I 'm sure we 'll dream good dreams together . Take it away ! This is the second-generation Boomer . For three years now , the country has been covering part of its budget and Zone Corporation has been advancing its development . Incorporating a new type of AI , it is capable of mental processes and actions that are even closer to human than previous models . In other words , it 's a whole new type of Boomer . Just how close to human is it ? As an example , even if you were to talk to it over the phone you wouldn 't realize it was a Boomer . That 's the degree of conversational ability it possesses . It 's no stronger than a human being and doesn 't have as much combat ability as other Boomers . However , it is almost certainly armed . It massacred the entire laboratory staff before making its escape . All of you , read this report carefully . You can 't identify the second-generation Boomer from outward appearances . You 'll have to use your heads ! ... unless you WANT people to say that AD Police Detectives are dumber than Boomers ... ! I 'll finish the research your father left behind , I swear . Wait and see , Sylia . Dr. Haynes ... Welcome to Geo City . Descending 300 meters into the ground , this giant underground city establishes a new form for Tokyo . Completed just this year , this Hyper-Intelligent Space is but a single element of the Underground Development Plan . YES ! No way ... I can 't believe it ! Yes way . Only you lost , Linna . Linna treats ! Cheers ! Do you have any idea what I had to go through to get a membership here ? Be that as it may , you lost , and you know it ! You must be making a bundle off that membership , anyway . But do you suppose it 's really okay to build a golf course underground ? Say what you like , but there 's no more open space left aboveground . It 's underground from now on , I tell you . A second-generation Boomer ? Right . Apparently , it went berserk during testing . This Dr. Haynes who was killed ... he was an assistant to Sylia 's father , wasn 't he ? The funeral 's today ... Sylia 's probably in shock . It was ' cause he was making good-for-nothing Boomers . Don 't talk like that . Sylia 's father gave birth to the Boomers . Well , isn 't that why he got killed in that accident ? Trading his life like that for Boomers ... I don 't get it ... How many people do you suppose have died ' cause of Boomers ? Priss ... I hate Boomers and the jerks who make them . Soldiers ... There 's even a military staging area under Geo City . It 's got everything , huh ? The EM-302 possesses power that sets it apart from conventional combat Boomers . Enough with the specs . Just show me how it looks in action . Right , then we 'll begin . This is only the beginning . lts power and speed are most impressive ! Will it be satisfactory , then ? Hey ... Hey ! Make it stop ! Stop it ! Hurry ! Don 't worry . It has a safety program to prevent it from hurting people . Damn ! Safety is the problem , isn 't it ? I decline to end up like Haynes did ! Forgive me We 're still working on part of the AI . I think we 'll be able to get satisfactory results by next week . So its power is first-rate , but its brain is third-rate , huh ? Hey ! It 's him ! What 's the matter ? That guy who was with those soldiers in Geo City earlier today . I knew I 'd seen him somewhere before . That picture 's from the Stingray Laboratory , isn 't it ? Yeah ... Oh yeah , it does resemble him . And the one standing next to him is the murdered Dr. Haynes , right ? Let me see . Hey ! That 's Sylia , isn 't it ? She was still cute back then , wasn 't she ? And what 's that supposed to mean , Nene ? Oh , there you are , Sylia ! People , we 've got work to do . These are the schematics of " Adama " , the second-generation Boomer . The AI components that the Illegal Army was after were the ones that Dr. Haynes developed for Adama . The Doctor was continually advocating peaceful applications for Boomers and Adama 's AI would surely have been programmed to react negatively to orders such as murder . Adama ... a Boomer created by Dr. Haynes shouldn 't be able to kill people . But there were witnesses who said they saw a Boomer brandishing a gun . That wasn 't Adama . Somebody set that up . And that same somebody made off with Adama . It 's the same as when my father died , twelve years ago . Dr. Haynes tried to realize the dream my father was unable to achieve . Dream ? To develop Boomers as close to human as possible . Boomers which could be friends to mankind . Adama was to have been the first of these . Boomers can 't be like human beings ! Perhaps so . But my father believed that someday they would be . I won 't believe that . I wouldn 't want to live in a world like that . I 'm sure you 'll change your mind when you meet Adama . Which means you already know where Adama is , right ? Uh-huh . I 've already figured it out . Only a very few people knew about Adama . The culprit is my father 's former assistant , Dr. Yuri . What are you doing , Dr. Yuri ? Are you still analyzing Adama 's data ? Yes . It 'll take a little longer . Haynes left hardly any data behind . Hurry it up . We don 't have much time left . Don 't worry . We have acquired Adama itself . Now , will you leave me in peace ? Unless you transmit the data within three days , I will have Adama moved . Damn terrorist ... Good night , Adama . The subway ... Geo City ... Yo , this is no place for Boomers , you know ! What the hell 's this ? I 've never seen this kind before . This thing got an owner or what ? Hey , Boomer ! Whatcha doin ' here ? I would like to get on the subway ... but I 'm afraid I 've become lost ... " I 'm afraid ... ? " It talked like a human just now ! Um ... which way should I go to get on the subway ? Um ... did I do something ... ? Well , Okay . Come with us . It 's definitely a type I 've never seen before . Ain 't it somethin ' ? Worth at least 2000 credits . 1700 . Aw , what the hell . What a couple of morons . They gave me a Boomer like this for peanuts . Um ... C 'mere ! Is this the way to the subway station ? What 're you talkin ' about ? Look , just stay right there . What are you doing ? The speech circuits seem to be well-made . I must get to Geo City . Geo City ? You got an owner there or what ? Well , it don 't matter much now . 'Cause I 'm gonna erase your data . Erase my data ? It 'll just be messy if you got old data in you when I sell you . Or I can chop you up and sell you for parts . Seeing as how you got such choice parts , for hot goods , that is . Hey ! Is anybody in there ? AD Police ! Y-y-yes ... ? Have you bought any Boomers of unknown ownership recently ? You kiddin ' ? I 'm not in that kind of business ... And just what business ARE you in , you lousy fence ? ! I don 't know nothin ' ! I swear ! Let 's have a look around . Dr. Yuri 's lab is here , in District Seven . If we 're gonna sneak in , the shortest way would be this underground section . Hey , Priss ! You listening ? I 'm listening ! I can 't get worked up about this job . So what about some second generation Boomer ? Sylia 's just too much the romantic . Hey , let 's say the loser at rock-scissor - paper has to go underground alone ! That 's a great idea ! One , two , three ! What is it ? Contact from your end is troublesome . Did you have Adama moved ? ! What are you talking about ? Adama 's gone ! You don 't mean he ran away on his own , do you ? Damn your eyes , Dr. Haynes ... Adama was all set to activate . But ... without any orders , a Boomer can 't just ... It seems you underestimated Adama . This is what it means to be a second - generation Boomer ! You idiot ! We must capture Adama , at all costs . His AI is essential to our project . Shit , why do I have to save some damn Boomer ? What 're you grumbling about ? You lost , and you know it ! You two set me up , didn 't you ? Why , whatever do you mean ? Damn you ... ! I 'll get you for this ! Anyway , we 're right outside the entrance to the lab , so call if anything happens . That 's all ! Signing off ! Oh well ... What do you want , you stupid Boomer ? Uh , um ... Which way should I go to get on the subway ? The subway ? I saw you going underground , so I followed you . How should I know ? Go ask AD Police ! I ask you , what 's a Boomer doing in a place like this ? Hey ... wait for me ! Hey ! Stop following me ! Where 's your owner ? He 's dead . That 's par for the course . It 's a very sad thing . I 'm sorry , but I haven 't got time to play with you . That 's too bad ... Sorry ' bout that . He talks an awful lot like a human being ... Hey ! What 's your owner 's name ? Dr. Haynes . Haynes ? Then you 're ... Run ! We 've found him . He 's in the sewer system . Send the other Boomers after him too . Damn you , Adama , what are you up to ? Did you escape from Yuri 's place by yourself ? That 's right . The Boomer pursuing us is the same one that shot Dr. Haynes . Pl ... Please stop ! Heh . Bite me ! Let 's go . I 'm here to rescue you . This is Priss ! This is Priss ! Come in ! Hey ! Do you read me ? Damn , must 've busted it somewhere back there . Um , the subway ... ? Enough about the subway , already ! Hey ... that 's it ! I can make contact from the public phones at the station . Okay , let 's go . The fact that you have a gun ... does that mean you 're AD Police ? Nope . I always carry it around , just so I can destroy Boomers like you . That 's awful . Who 're you to talk , Boomer ? How many of these damn Boomers are there ? Hey ! What 're you doing ? I might be able to open this door . Really ? Can you really get it open ? I don 't know ... Don 't give me that ! You did it ! Where do you think you 're going , Dr. Yuri ? I 've figured out Adama 's objective . That was Dr. Yuri . What could Priss be doing ? Priss ? Where are you ? What ? The subway ? Yeah . I 've found Adama . Seems he escaped on his own . We 'll come get you right away , so just stay right there ! Thanks . We 're being chased by Combat Boomers . Roger ! I made contact ... ! Now where did that bastard go ... ? Geo City 's last train arrives on Platform 1 . Geo City 's last train arrives on Platform 1 . Hey ! Please wait behind the white line . What 're you doing ? Boomers can 't ride the subway by themselves ! Then let 's get on together ! Forget it . Come on . AD Police . Are you the owner of that Boomer ? Uh , well ... May I please see your owner 's card ? I finally made it onto the subway . Subway , subway ... Why you ... ! Next time you pull a stunt like that , I 'll cut your main switch ! They 're not here ! And after we told her to stay put ... It looks like a couple of AD Police officers were killed here . Something must have happened to Priss and Adama , as well . Let 's watch the situation for now . I 'll ready the suits . That 's why it 's safest to go to where Sylia is , I 'm telling you ! Dr. Haynes , and no one else , is my owner . Man ! You 're a pretty stubborn bastard , for a Boomer . I must get to Geo City . First it was the subway , now it 's Geo City ? ! I swear ... I shoulda let them blow you to pieces back there ! Why should humans want me to be in pieces ? Let me try talking to her . What ? H-Hey ... ! Hold it ! Damn you ! You used the fact that you 're both Boomers to talk your way out ! You 're just trying to save yourself ! It 's all right now . I accessed her AI , and told her that we are not her enemies . Really ? She should consider you her friend . Geo City . Geo City . Bye-bye ! I 've upped my opinion of you , Adama ! That 's the first time you 've called me by name ! Hell ... Let 's go . Uh , Sylia ? It 's me . Geo City ? I 'm going nuts ! He wants to go beneath Geo City , and won 't take no for an answer ! Okay , I see . Perhaps Adama has need of the Supercomputer ? Supercomputer ? ! Whatever ! Just hurry up and save us , Okay ? I don 't want to commit lover 's suicide with the likes of him ! Okay , Okay . There 's something I 'd like to ask you ... What is it ? Why do you hate Boomers ? Hating them is natural . No one likes them . That 's prejudice . Dr. Haynes , at least , did not think like that . Countless friends have been killed by Boomers ... Boomers are puppets , their movements programmed into them ... But so long as such things exist ... Those would be Combat Boomers , like the ones we met earlier . I 'm different , because I possess Dr. Haynes ' special AI . I know full well that you 're not like other Boomers . But just because you 're different doesn 't mean I like you . How ornery can a person get ? I never should have saved you . Back there , it was I who saved you . For a Boomer , you sure do talk back a lot . I really oughta ... blow you ... into ... Look out ! Adama ! Shit ! Damn ! Heh . Eat that ! Freeze ! Let Adama go ! Adama ! Come here ! Bastard ! Adama ! Thanks a million ! Now do you understand why I hate Boomers ? But I saved you again . Heh . So you did . It 's kinda cold here . Really ? It feel fine to me . Whatever , just hurry it up , will you ? Dr. Haynes designed me using this Supercomputer . Only here can I output my data . Hey , what 's this ? The video of Dr. Yuri killing Dr. Haynes . I was recording the video signal from the lab 's security camera . So that 's why you ... Dr. Haynes was killed because of me . But there was nothing I could do . All I can do is keep safe the memories that Dr. Haynes gave me . Boomers are not meant to be used for war or for crime . The doctor taught me that . I want to communicate this to other Boomers , too . I understand . You 're one helluva Boomer . Let 's go to Sylia 's place . If anyone can grant your desire , Sylia can . In all honesty , I am quite surprised , Adama . Your AI is truly magnificent . Dr. Yuri , you have committed a crime . You must give yourself up ! It 's no use resisting ! I don 't know who you are , but you will give me Adama . If this disc is made public , you 'll be finished . IF it is made public . But you cannot escape from this place . Once I 've programmed your AI for combat and transplanted it this Combat Boomer should be invincible . I decline to become so grotesque a creature ! It 'll soon grow on you , once I erase your superfluous data . You 're the scum of the earth ! Well , since you 're being so unreasonable ... Hey , Adama ! Change its programming ! No good ! I can 't access its AI ! Just when I need you most , you 're useless ! Your gun won 't have any effect against its armor , either ! You think I don 't know that ? Knight Sabers Go ! It 's about time ! Come on ! You 're a Knight Saber too ! You can at least take care of yourself ! Uh ... is this really the time for such talk ? Be careful . That 's no ordinary Boomer . That 's Okay . Leave this to us ! It 's all yours ! Roger ! This thing 's a brute ! It 's tough , huh ! Damn ... Come on , come on ! Damn ... if only I had my suit ... Priss ! Hurry ! All right , Sylia ! Adama ! Adama ! Sylia , I 'm going in ! Roger ! Damned crab-thing ... ! I 'm paying you back with interest ! Get a load of these souped-up parts ! Bastard ! Damn ! That 's far enough , Dr. Yuri . If you wish to atone for your crimes , give yourself up . All ... All right . Don 't shoot ! Die ! I have acquired Adama 's data , Sylia . Who ... ? Dr. Yuri hid the data , intending to monopolize the profits . Now I have absolutely everything . So ... you 're the mastermind . But I won 't let you get away with this ! Sylia , let me show you our utopia controlled only through terror and chaos . Are you capable of guarding against it , I wonder ? Hey ! Adama ! Hey ! Adama , hang on ! Adama ... The disc ... Yeah , I 'll give it to AD Police . Please ... tell me your name . Priss ... my name is Priss ! Miss Priss , I beg you . Please don 't let them put my AI in a Combat Boomer . Yeah , I promise . My battery is damaged , and can no longer maintain my memory . Good-bye ... Miss Priss ... Adama ! ADAMA ! " Are you capable of guarding against it , I wonder ... ? " Sylia . I 'm starting to believe a little bit too . In your father 's dream , that is . Thank you , Priss . Man , I 'm starving ! Sylia , fly faster ! Roger ! Your small voice comes back to life in my ears tonight . Now , even the legends you left behind in a distant night will sleep tonight , rocked by the wind . With tranquil heart , I strain to hear and tomorrow 's footfalls echo in my breast . The words you tried to speak at the last words that would have followed our good-bye " Don 't give up on your dreams ... " ... were smeared on the postcard you sent me . Like flower petals , the rain keeps falling , making things hazy tonight . Now , because people are alone , they love and trust one another and come to know farewells by moonlight at night . Someday the scenery will change color and knock softly on the window of the heart . The song you were singing at the last which you were singing over and over again the song we both liked is one I will carry with me always . The song you were singing at the last which you were singing over and over again the song we both liked is one I will carry with me always .

 Mulder , it 's me . I just had something incredibly strange happen . This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry- - it has some kind of a code on it . I ran it through a scanner and some kind of a serial number came up . What the hell is this thing , Mulder ? It 's almost as if ... It 's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him . Come on , lady ! Mulder ! I need your help ! - Come on ! - Mulder ! Mulder ! Come on , lady ! I need your help ! Mulder ! Mulder ! I 'm sorry , ma 'am , but we can 't disturb the crime scene . But this is my daughter 's apartment . - If you 'll just wait ... - Let me go ! I have to get through ! I have to get in ! Mrs. Scully ? She 's not in there . Where is she ? Where is she ? This is Holly Reardon reporting live . Police have refused to identify the kidnapping victim . However , we have received unconfirmed information ... I knew it would happen this way . I had this dream about Dana being taken away . It 's so strange . I , uh ... I was going to call her , but I was afraid I was going to scare her . She would have laughed at me anyway . She doesn 't believe in that kind of thing , you know . According the reports I 've reviewed , Agent Scully 's research states that Duane Barry 's propensity for violent , deviant behavior is due to brain damage from a bullet wound in the head . Is this the operational opinion ? Yes , sir . Is there another ? He 's convinced he 's going to be abducted by aliens , that by taking someone to the abduction site , he won 't be abducted himself . That he 's following orders from alien voices in his head ? Yes . That 's an interesting spin on the Nuremberg defense . Which explanation do you subscribe to , Agent Mulder ? There 's a question of how he could have gotten to her in the first place . And you think these alien voices told him ? Agent Scully was carrying a small piece of metal that was removed from Duane Barry 's abdomen- - an implant he described as a tracking device . Agent Scully thought that you had made a major miscalculation in Duane Barry 's psychosis . - Is that true ? - Yes . But that still doesn 't explain how he could 've found her . Where would he be taking her ? I don 't know . He ... He talked about a mountain , but he wasn 't specific about the location . Well , however he got to her , and whatever his motives , he took Agent Scully 's car and her weapon . I think we all understand the seriousness of this matter and should proceed ahead quickly with all possible resources . I need you to turn over your files to HRT . I 'd like to brief them myself , sir . Go home , Agent Mulder . You 've been up all night . - Get some sleep . - Sir , I know Duane Barry . I 've been in his head , I know how he thinks . You 're too close to this case ! If we can use you , we will . Sir ... That 's an order , Agent Mulder . Make sure he gets home safely . Come on . ♪ You 'll see him in your nightmares ♪ ♪ You 'll see him in your dreams ♪ ♪ He 'll appear out of nowhere ♪ ♪ But he ain 't what he seems ♪ ♪ You 'll see him in your head ♪ ♪ On the TV screen ♪ ♪ Hey , buddy , I 'm warning you to turn it off ♪ ♪ He 's a ghost , he 's a god ♪ ♪ He 's a man , he 's a guru ♪ ♪ You 're one microscopic cog ♪ ♪ In his catastrophic plan ♪ ♪ Designed and directed by his red right hand ... ♪ Sir , could you turn off your radio ? I would , Officer , but I got to keep going . An FBI APB has been issued for a suspect in the abduction of an FBI ... Sir , I asked if you mind turning that off . Okay . But could you just give me the ticket now so I can go ? I got to be someplace . Where ? I 'm not sure , but they 'll tell me when I get there . Sir , put your hands on the steering wheel where I can see them . You don 't understand . They 're waiting for me . I-I can 't be late . Put your hands up and exit the vehicle . No . I got to keep moving . Please ? For your own sake ? Don 't stop Duane Barry . Sir , put your hands up . Right there . Okay . Back it up a few frames . Okay , now magnify this area . My God . She 's still alive . Print this up . I just want to go back to the place . What place ? Where it first started . Where they first came and got me . Where is that ? A mountain . We went , uh , up and ... up . Ascending ... ascending to the stars . Ascending ... Coffee ? Yeah ? Thanks . Yeah . How 'd you sleep ? I didn 't . They 're not taking Duane Barry again . A mountain . We went , uh , up and ... up . Ascending ... ascending to the stars . ... ascending to the stars . What is it ? Where was that patrolman killed again ? Rixeyville , Virginia . Route 229 . Doesn 't 229 lead to the Blue Ridge Parkway ? I don 't know . What ? " Ascend to the stars . Skyland Mountain . " You know where he 's going ? Get your car and meet me downstairs in five minutes . Where are we going ? Just get your car . What about Skinner ? I 'll deal with Skinner . He thinks Scully 's been taken up to Skyland Mountain . I 'll hold him off until they locate her . Wait . Here he comes . I 'll be in touch . Come on . Let 's go . Hey ! You 're dozing off . Maybe I should drive . I 'm fine . Well , you haven 't slept yet . I have . I said I 'm fine . You know , Chernobyl , Exxon Valdez , Three Mile Island- - they were all linked to sleep deprivation . The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that over 190,000 fatal car crashes every year are caused by sleepiness . Did they estimate how many people are put to sleep listening to their statistics ? I 'm just trying to keep you awake . Look , I know you think we should have told Skinner , but if he sends in the whole cavalry , Duane Barry might go over the edge . You 're right . If we find him first , we 'll notify the Bureau . All right ? Yeah . You really think he tracked her down with that implant ? Well , that 's the easiest explanation . It 's also the most implausible . Is there another possibility ? Somebody could have given him her address . I don 't know who . There 's our turnoff . Have you seen this guy ? Yeah , he was here . He 's wanted for kidnapping a federal agent . Did you let him go up in the tram ? No way . It 's shut down in the summer . I told him to take the back road up . - How long ago ? - About 45 minutes . - Did he have a woman with him ? - No . How long 's it take to drive to the top ? Little over an hour . - You got to get me up there . - No . No way . We just got done refitting the cable . It hasn 't been tested with passengers yet . You 'll have to drive . - I don 't have the time . - You don 't have a choice . No , you don 't have a choice . Okay , I can 't stop you from going up there , but if there 's a problem with the cable , I 'm shutting this thing down . I 'm not going to be responsible for your death . What are you doing ? Stay here , and whatever happens , don 't let him stop the tram . Okay , you hit your " run " and " up " button on the panel . Speed indicator controls your ascent . Now , when you want to slow down ... Don 't crank it faster than 15 ! What the hell is he doing ? I told him not to go that fast . Base to car one , pick up . Do you hear that sound ? At this speed , the cable can 't hold . ... the handset . Can you hear me ? Slow ... Base to car one , pick up . Go ahead . Slow it down . - You 're breaking up . - Slow down or the cable will ... the tower . Second tower 's coming up . Slow it down through the next tower . How close is he ? Should be up top in a minute . There he is . What are you doing ? Turn this back on . Krycek , what 's happening down there ? Krycek , do you read me ? Tell the operator to restart the tram . Hello ? I 've got him stalled up there . Hello . Krycek , can you read me ? I 'll hold until you advise . Is there an emergency system on board ? Can you read me down there ? Can anyone read me ? ... cloudiness with scattered rain and intermittent thundershowers throughout the evening . Look for highs tomorrow around 65 degrees , with tonight 's low dipping to 48 degrees . That high-pressure ridge has moved east now . There will be unstable activity on into the weekend . Joining me now for the business report is Sue Roberts . The dollar turned in a mixed performance on the foreign exchange markets while closing stronger here . Gold dropped almost two dollars in spite of continued speculation about inflationary trends . Silver was down 80 cents . The blue-chip indicator rose slightly in moderate trading with gains outnumbering declines by a margin of four to three . A government source stated that the U.S. will abolish ... Yeah ! Federal agent ! Yes ! Freeze ! Yes , yes ! Freeze ! Yes ! I said freeze ! Where is she ? I 'm free , you son of a bitches ! You can 't touch Duane Barry anymore ! Don 't move ! Don 't move ! I 'm not going anywhere ! Where is she ? Where did you leave her ? They took her . Who ? Them ! I told you they were going to take somebody else . They did ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Sheriff , search and rescue chopper has found them on the mountain . We 've sent out five teams to search for that missing federal agent . Some water ? We 'll wait outside . Now , what happened after you took her out of the trunk ? We walked a little ways up to the top of the mountain . Right where you found me . Then where did you take her ? I didn 't . They did . That was the deal . Her instead of me . Did you kill her ? No . I swear . How 'd you get this ? From the ship . What ship ? You saw it . I saw a helicopter . They were here . I 'm not lying to you ! There they are . Ask them . They know what happened . - Sit down , Duane . - No ! You 've got to stop them ! Hurry ! Hurry ! They were just out there ! They were right outside ! Duane , settle down . They 'll tell you where she is ! The military 's in on it . Just ask them . Did you hurt her ? No . - Did you hurt her ? ! - No ! What is this ? I 'm sorry . They had to take her . I hope they 're not hurting her too much with the tests . I 'm sorry . Hey . Yeah ? What 's the matter ? What did he say to you ? He 's giving me nothing . Were you out here alone ? Yeah , why ? Nobody goes in or out of that room . Hey , Mulder . What are you doing in there ? I heard him ... Come here . Come here . I heard him gagging in there . He couldn 't breathe . - He said you choked him . - No one ... no one ... no one is to interrogate the suspect . Except you ? Except me . Did you ask him about Scully ? Yeah . What did he say ? He started whistling " Stairway to Heaven . " Keep an eye on him . Okay . You got Duane Barry ? Yes , sir . Agent Mulder , you disobeyed my direct order . Call the paramedics ! What happened ? He was gagging . Duane ? Duane ? Duane ! Coming through ! Respiration ? Mmm , nothing . Start CPR . - Ready ? - Yeah . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three ... Excuse me . I 'm Agent Mulder . I 'd like a copy of this man 's autopsy report . I 'm sorry . It 's still incomplete . Are you the pathologist ? Yes . Can I ask what your preliminary findings are ? Um ... " second-degree burns on the face . Contusions about the neck , bruised larynx ... " If I had to list cause of death at this point , I 'd have to say asphyxiation . Were you expecting something else ? You haven 't run a toxicological yet ? They should be finished shortly . I 'd be interested to see what you find . When will it be on file ? Later this morning . I 'd like a copy as soon as possible , please . Well , I 'm sorry- - you 'll have to go through regular military channels . What do you mean , " military " ? You 're not FBI ? Quantico 's under military jurisdiction . There wasn 't an FBI pathologist available this morning . Skinner 's expecting my report on the Duane Barry incident . What do I tell him ? The truth . What do you mean ? Confirm Mulder 's version of events . You 've earned his trust . The object now is to preserve it . For how much longer ? Until your assignment is completed . If Mulder 's such a threat , why not eliminate him ? That 's not policy . It 's not ? After what you had me do ? Kill Mulder , and you risk turning one man 's religion into a crusade . What about Scully ? We 've taken care of that . How ? We tell you only what you need to know . I think I have a right to know . You have no rights , only orders to be carried out . If you have a problem with that , we 'll make other arrangements . Victim appears to have expired from prolonged hypoxemia secondary to asphyxiation . Of several possible etiologies , the most likely is strangulation due to the presence of contusions and a bruised larynx . Do you want to speak to this , Agent Mulder ? I didn 't kill him , if that 's what you 're suggesting . But you attacked him ? I was interrogating him about Agent Scully . He wasn 't cooperating , so I pushed him . And you lost control . Momentarily . But then I left the room . He was very much alive . I spoke to him . Agent Krycek spoke to him . Agent Krycek says he entered the room because the suspect was gagging . Is Agent Krycek asserting that I killed him , too ? No . He corroborates your story . But the fact is , we 've got a dead suspect , Agent Mulder , and no other plausible cause of death . OPC wants the both of you to take a lie detector test . You 're to report there immediately . There is another plausible cause of death . Which is ? Poisoning by injection or ingestion . Poisoning ? You won 't find that on the Navy pathologist 's report . What are you saying , Agent Mulder ? That the autopsy is incomplete . That the military covered up the toxicological findings . And why would they do that ? Because they know where Scully is . Why are you so paranoid , Mulder ? Oh , I don 't know . Maybe it 's because I find it hard to trust anybody . Alex . Alex , can I borrow your car keys ? Why ? Where are you going ? There 's somebody I got to see . Yeah , but we 're scheduled at OPC . I know . Just give me the keys , please . Thanks . Don 't forget , 1 : 00 ! You wasted a trip , Mr. Mulder . There 's nothing the senator can do for you now . What ? Not without committing political suicide . Why ? Do they have something on him ? They have something on everyone , Mr. Mulder . The question is when they 'll use it . I need his help . No one can help you now . Your channels of appeal and recourse are closed . Your predecessor could have helped me . Oh . You know , don 't you ? You know what 's happened to her . This reaches beyond any of us , Mr. Mulder , even my predecessor . I want an answer . Why kill Duane Barry if there was nothing to hide ? You mean the government ? There are no answers for you , Mr. Mulder . They only have one policy . Deny everything . This is a serious allegation , Agent Mulder . Only so far as it is true . " Agent Krycek was hired or suborned " by an outside agency to impede a federal investigation " and may be responsible for the death of a suspect in a capital murder case " ? It goes on . " And the possible murder of the tram operator at Skyline Mountain . " There 's a lot of blood on this document , Agent Mulder . Are you standing behind this , going on the record ? Yes , sir . Well , then you damn well better have the facts to back it up . I need to see Agent Krycek immediately . I can 't protect you , Agent Mulder . Past a point , this will become a larger Bureau matter . All right . What do you got ? I found this in Agent Krycek 's car . He doesn 't smoke . Agent Krycek was the last person with Duane Barry before he died . He was also the last person to see the tram operator before he disappeared . When I got to the top of Skyline Mountain , I saw an unmarked helicopter working the area . I believe that Agent Krycek gave away the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Agent Scully to whoever he 's working with . And who is that ? I don 't know . The military ? Some covert organization within the government ? Whoever it is that the man who smokes those cigarettes works for . - Why ? - Because Agent Scully got too close to whatever it is they 're trying to deny . Because she had hard and damning evidence : that metallic implant in her possession . Or because her termination would prevent further involvement with me and my work . Do you think Agent Scully 's dead ? I don 't know . How far do you think they 'd go ? What do you know about Agent Krycek ? I didn 't give him the assignment . I only ... Yes . Thank you . Agent Krycek didn 't show up for work this morning . His home number has been disconnected . That 's it ? He 's gone ? He just disappears into the woodwork ? So it would appear . Who are these people who can just murder with impunity and we can 't do anything about it ? Let it go , Agent Mulder . Like hell . There 's nothing you can do . What can you do about it ? There 's only one thing that I can do , Agent Mulder : As of right now , I 'm reopening the X Files . That 's what they fear the most . Agent Mulder ? Thank you for calling me . I 'm sorry I don 't have better news . Do you know something ? Is Dana okay ? We don 't know anything more about her . I know you 're doing all you can . I had that dream again last night about Dana being taken away . I can 't tell you how it scares me . It 's probably scarier when you stop having the dream . Don 't you think ? I found this . It 's something I ... I never considered about her . If she was , um ... if she was such a skeptic , why did she wear that ? I gave it to her on her 15th birthday . Don 't you want to keep it ? When you find her , you give it to her . I made this !

 [ Woman ] My earliest memories of it were the stories , how it was once thought so vast - infinite skies , deep seas , boundless mountain ranges . But they were only stories . I was born on the stations , just like my parents ... and their parents before them . It 's the only life I 've ever known . But I still think about those stories of Earth . And I tell them to my son as we prepare to flee this life of ours on the stations , a life that is ordered , efficient , sterile ... and , for a small group of children , deadly . My son is one of the unlucky ones . He was born with the Syndrome . Ulysses , are you listening ? Do you think when we get to the planet , I 'll be able to , you know , like , run right out of the ship ? No . Not right out of the ship , but in time . Now , may we please continue with our geography ? [ Woman Narrating ] Six years ago , Uly was diagnosed with a disease ... our medical community hesitates to even recognize , a disease not caused by the presence of a virus , but , rather , an absence - an absence of what nature can provide , an absence of fresh air , of fresh water , New Pacifica is bordered on the west ... by the Sea of Antaeus . an absence of Earth . And it is on this shoreline we 'll be landing . Are there going to be beasts on the planet , Mom ? - What kind of beasts , Uly ? - I don 't know . Big . Bigger than this whole ship . And skin like - like the elephant from my virtual reality , with teeth and tusks that shoot out from his face ... like , you know , tentacles ? [ Coughing ] And-And at the end of each tentacle , hands with nine fingers . You think there 'll be any monsters like that on the new planet ? I certainly hope not , Uly . Now , it 's time for you to get some rest , all right ? We have a very , " very " big day tomorrow . Hmm . Can I sit by the pilot when we launch ? Yes , if you 're quiet . Okay ? [ Beeping ] - Yes ? - Big fire , Dev . Cockpit . I 'm putting my son to bed , Commander . - Can 't wait . I need you now . - Okay . I will be right back , all right ? When I come back , I am gonna tell you a long , scary story . [ Devon Narrating ] This quest to save my son has grown larger than even I could imagine . Tonight , 250 Syndrome families wait with us , docked beside our small advance ship . In eight hours , our lives will change forever , as we light out in search of a place like Earth once was , a place where children can thrive , a planet we might call home . What ? What is it ? Something you should see . Picked up from - [ Indistinct ] [ Woman 's Voice ] Ms. Adair 's private expedition had been in the planning stages for six years , despite virulent opposition from both medical and scientific fields . Internet satellite ? To repeat , the Eden Project , bound to set up the first colony in the G8 system , met with disaster this morning , exploding upon departure . There were no survivors . [ Scoffs ] What ? What is this , some kind of a joke ? It 's government-released , Adair . Preapproved by three panels nine hours before broadcast . No jokes . Coded for 0900 hours tomorrow morning . That 's an hour after we launch . That 's right . They-They 've given up trying to stall us , so now they 're just going to kill us ? They 're going to try . We find a better world out there than these sanitized cans , they lose control . I 'm running a resonant scan of the entire ship right now . - You think there 's explosives on board ? - You don 't ? We cannot risk another delay . There are over 200 Syndrome families on the colony ship , prepping for cold sleep right now . No delays . We 'll launch on schedule . No . No , we need to launch now . - Solace , what 's our status ? - We 're at zero minus eight and a half hours . You weren 't hired to tell me the time , Ace . - " Portal 's yawning wide open . " I 'd say they 're expecting a freighter . - Now you 're talkin ' . - Advise colony . We 're moving . - Yes , sir ! - Baines ! - Yeah . - Get the operations crew together . - Right . We 're on a tight departure . Dad ? Dad ! Hey , Dad ? Over here , sweetheart . Dad , we 're moving . Yeah , it feels like it . What 's up , baby ? They 're looking for you . Uh-oh . Let 's go . Resonant scan came up with 97 non-registered items . We need a physical scan of all specified areas immediately . - Explosive check and launching at the same time ? - Just find it ! Let 's go . [ Man On P.A. ] Colony ship on approach . [ Woman On P.A. ] Colony ship - [ Indistinct ] Hospital ward reports all 248 Syndrome children are secured . Brace yourself , Sheila . We 'rejust about to kiss you here . [ Man On P.A. : Indistinct ] Engaging . Accelerating . [ Sheila ] Initial contact . [ Metal Clanging ] We have coupling . Smooth as always , Mr. Solace . Eden Advance , this is Port Control 1-9 . Please advise . We 're showing a no-go . Just stretching our legs , 1-9 . Getting in position for manana . What the hell is going on ? What the " hell " is going on ? What the - What 's going on here ? You 're our government liaison , Martin . Why the hell don 't you tell us ? What is he talking about ? Who authorized our departure ? We don 't have level six clearance yet . Eden ships , you are in violation of port ordinance . Acknowledge . Will someone with some weight talk to these nice folks , please ? If you 're still on board , Mr. Martin , I assume you have no idea what your friends on level six have planned for us tomorrow . Well , they 're releasing us to planet G889 . Guess again . Solace ! Are you out of your mind ? You 're not one of these lunatics . Orient and redock before they take your charter bars . You wanna pay my freight , 1-9 ? I kinda doubt you can match these people 's credit weight . Well , I just may retire off this run . What do you say ? Eden Advance , we still show no-go . Return to dock facility . Repeat : We will contact Port Authority . Feel free to contact whoever you damn well please . We 're making a run for it . [ Female Computer Voice ] Bay two portal doors are now closing . Bay two portal doors are now closing . If you could just tell me what you 're looking for , maybe I could help you . Ma 'am , what is this ? It 's - It 's my husband 's . No triggers . Opening item check number 19 . Well , the case is his , but , sir , the contents are mine . Government quarter sector three clear . Anything ? Nah . Negative . I 'm up to comm deck . Those doors won 't reverse , Solace . We 're shutting down Apex guidance . Now , when was the last time you piloted manual , Lonz ? [ Female Computer Voice ] Apex guidance system is off . [ Man ] You breach that hull , and we 'll have a hell of a mess on our hands . Thanks for the vote of confidence , 1-9 . I 'll keep that in mind . Okay , Ace . Now 's the time . You as good as you say you are ? Show me . Nav , I need vertical marker positioning right now . Inside the launch tube ? Without Apex ? - " [ Alonzo ] Just follow my marks . " - " Okay . " Retros at 50 % . Check . - " [ Alonzo ] Auto-positional . " - " [ Man ] Where are we going , Devon ? " [ Alonzo ] I want positioning feeds from you at five-second intervals . You got it ? [ Navigator ] Got it . Let 's do it . Well , well , well . Look at all this activity . [ Alonzo ] Stay on line here . Mr. Blalock , sir . Morgan Martin , level four . I just wanted you to realize that I , in no way , sanctioned this - Blalock , go back to sleep . You 'rejust having a bad dream . You have a scheduled departure in eight hours , Devon . Movement like this could put your clearance at risk . All these years of planning , Devon . All those obstacles . - Three degrees . Mark it . - Mark . [ Grunts ] I know we 've been difficult , but now , eight hours to go , and this final insubordinate act ? Let 's just say after all the years of clearance stalls , I 've grown just a tad antsy . Devon , everything we 've done has been for your benefit , to protect " you " from the unknown . Oh , come on , Blalock . You 've seen the probe info . The planet has a habitability rating of 83 . [ Blalock ] No human has ever been as far as G889 , Devon . - " Personally - " - Keep him on the hook , Adair . Keep him talking . Think I 'd like staying on the stations , Dison ? Syndrome children are dying . Two generations , we may all be extinct . [ Instrument Squealing ] [ Alonzo ] Okay . Stay on it . Devon , no one 's more sorry than I am ... that your little boy is sick . It is sad when children die . People have always died . Doesn 't mean we have to run away from all we know . You 've put years of work into this , Devon . Why see it all come to a halt now ? You 've got 250 people counting on you , counting on both of us ... Oh , my God . - They 're gonna kill us . - to do the right thing here . What 's the point , Dison ? I thought we had clearance . Everything but level six , Devon . You know that . - We 're off . Dead center . - Bring it up to seven . I want speed now . Devon , you know as well as I do ... there are people who do not want you to succeed . Keep him cool , Adair . We need some time . [ Blalock ] I know who they are . [ Blalock ] " You are playing " right into their hands . Two little ships , Dison . A handful of unwanted , whispered-about families . - Most people would think of this as a cleansing . - Please , God ! Were it up to me , I 'd have let you leave long ago . This is a difficult situation , rife with internal politics , Devon ! No Syndrome child has lived beyond nine years . My son is eight , and I will not watch him die . [ Female Computer Voice ] Bay two portal doors are clear . [ Both Sighing ] Nice work . [ Blalock ] We need a few more months , a few more weeks ... to establish the habitability of G889 . Do not leave station subspace ... for your own good . I cannot stress how serious this is . Why , Dison ? Are you trying to tell me something ? Are you saying I 'm at risk ? Devon , you 're at risk anytime you 're out there without us . I can 't protect you , Devon . I cannot protect you . - [ O 'Neill On Headset ] We 're clear . - You gotta trust me on this , Devon . I 'm trying to help you here . I am trying to be a friend . One thing I 've learned , Dison - I 'm all out of friends . Don 't go off-line ! I wish you would listen to me ! Hello ? How long before they realize they didn 't get us ? [ O 'Neill On Headset ] Oh , I 'd say they know now . We 're already dead to them , Dev . They 're probably firing up that newscast as we speak . We 're on our own now . No turning back . [ Navigator ] Scanners show no station activity . They 're not coming after us . Just get us out of here . Yale , where 's Dr. Vasquez ? I can 't get him on gear , and he should be prepping Uly right now . Devon , Vasquez is not on board . What ? Apparently , he went to make a final check on the children on colony . But we had boarded for departure . Nobody was supposed to disembark without proper - Oh , my God . We have no doctor , Yale . Dr. Heller is on board . Dr. Heller ? Come on . She is the most junior member of his team . She 's barely qualified to be his intern . Dr. Heller has come to prep Uly for cold sleep . I should monitor him for 24 hours before the rest of us go down for hibernation . I agree . And , uh , you should get started . I assume Dr. Vasquez has explained ... the risks a child like Ulysses faces going into cold sleep , even under optimum conditions . I 'm well aware of the risks . We don 't have very much choice now , do we ? No , we don 't . You can tell everyone from mechanical to kitchen crew we stick with the original contract - transport to and deposit on planet . I 'm not asking for the crew . I 'm asking for myself . The contract said nothing about bomb scans or leaving under a no-go . Look , even after I drop you off , I still gotta come back here and do business with that port . Okay , let 's see . Twenty-two light-years each way . How many administrations you think that 'll be ? Just tell everyone hazard pay clause has been invoked . Thank you . Good . That 's all I wanted to know . I - All right . " Eden Advance , " colony ship prepped for disengage . Tell those passengers of yours to hang tight . By the time they 're out of cold sleep , we 'll have set up their new home in New Pacifica . [ Sheila On Radio ] Twenty-four years of sleep ? We can sure use it . Thanks for the push , boys . Hope you all sleep tight . You 're breaking my heart , Sheila . I wish we could bring you along . I love you , champ . I - I won 't wake up for 22 years , but it 'll seem like tomorrow , right ? Just like any other night . You don 't think I won 't wake up , do you ? You will wake up , Uly . I promise . And when you do , we 're gonna be on the verge of a whole new life . And then you can finish telling me that story with that beast of yours , okay ? I will . [ Device Hisses ] [ Whispering ] Night , Uly . Night . I love you , Mom . [ Mouthing Words ] [ Panel Beeps ] [ Devon Narrating ] We bring so many questions with us . Will this new planet hold the key to healing humanity ? Will the frontier hold the same promise it did for our ancestors ? And , most of all , will Uly ever get to slay his monsters ? [ Female Computer Voice ] Artificial gravity restoration : active . Atmospheric repressurization : active . Automatic pilot self-check : in progress . Artificial life-support system : check . Cryo-sleep chamber four . Heller , Julia . Physician . Neurological activity : high . Core temperature : normal . Alpha rising : .8 . [ Beeping ] Isn 't standard operation to have me verify position ... so you and I can hop back in a big sack if we 're a couple hundred million miles off course ? That 's right . Well , you 'll be happy to know that my record 's intact . I haven 't missed yet . Okay . [ Beeping ] I could postpone everyone 's defrost and celebrate life a little bit . What do you say ? Is that the only come-on you sleep jumpers can come up with these days ? You 've worked cold-sleep runs ? Well , let 's just say your reputation precedes you . I don 't have one . I 'm not around enough to make one . But you - You have some sleep in your eye . What ? [ Grunts ] Oh , man , oh , man . [ Giggling ] Oh , man . Lonz , tell me I can go back to bed . Sorry , pal . We 're right on course . I win the betting pool . Tell your guys to fork over . What are you , a morning person ? Hey , you know , 22 years is a drag , huh ? First cold sleep ? No , third . Never more than 19 months though . [ Groans ] I had some kind of weird dream or something . Not me , pal . I been under so many times , I lost my dream button . Never really get used to how the world changes though . One long night 's sleep , everything you knew ... almost a quarter of a century older . Probably a grandmother now . So that 's why we get the heavy pay , huh ? How old are you , man ? A lot older than you , kid . He 's still under 97 . That 's fine . Well , he should be responding by now . Cardiorespiratory 's improving . E.E.G. ' s on target . I think a stimulant is indicated . Devon , I do know what I 'm doing . Before apprenticing with Dr. Vasquez , I - You graduated cum laude in diagnostic analysis . I checked . Then you must also know that my parents had my chromosomes skewed towards the medical arts . Your background compensates for your lack of experience , but right now my son is - [ Coughing ] Uly ? Uly ? Uly , honey , I 'm here . I 'm right here . - Are we there yet ? - Almost . We 're almost there , honey . Almost there . [ Man ] ... any assigned held pods on B-4 should report there within an hour . [ Woman ] Where should I store this ? Copy . Hey . True , sweetheart . Come on . You gotta buzz your teeth . Need your help up top . I 'm getting a cat , right ? I had a dream I got my cat . Real cat ? Did you dream we won the trans-station lottery ? Hey . You promised . You said we 're gonna be richer . I know , but I didn 't say we were gonna be billionaires . You know how much a pet allotment costs ? Come on . I 'll meet you up top . Let me make this clear , Dad . After we go drop them off , and we get home , I get a cat . Not a cheapo synth cat . A real cat . No discussion . Understand ? Well ? Good . So I 'll meet you on deck . [ Woman ] Thank you . And what time do you wanna meet for dinner ? [ Man ] 0800 hours . Geez , I can 't believe we 're actually doing this , Bess . I mean , I hate travel . I hate that Devon woman . Miss Stop-The-World-My-Son-Is-Sick , My-Cyborg-Tutor-And-I-Want-To-Get-Off . I mean , what pretension ! Oh , how could I have been so stupid ? Bess , what are you looking at ? I feel older , Morgan . Well , you 're not . We 've been over this a million times , Bess . We were in suspended animation , remember ? We don 't age . It 's impossible . All right ? I didn 't say I " was " older . I said I " feel " older . And you can 't suspend feelings . [ Man On P.A. ] Technician Flores , report to station blue . Technician Flores , report to station blue . Bess , I 'm - I 'm sorry . I - I 've been under a lot of pressure lately . Bess , you know you 're my whole world . [ Beeping ] [ Rhythmic Hissing ] - Please don 't stare at me . - I 'm not . Uly , don 't wear yourself out now . Well , hello . We 'd heard there was another child on board . My dad said they stopped the Yale program , that you all went crazy . [ Man ] Check systems two through 10 . A few of the Yales did have faint recall of their criminal past . He doesn 't have a memory glitch . [ Chuckling ] He 's a great tutor . [ Yale Chuckling ] Well , I 'm sorry that we are parting ways at G889 . We all could have gotten to know one another . Take a look . [ O 'Neill ] Just what you wanted , Dev . A new place to call home . We made it . [ Whispering ] We 're on the other side of the stars . [ Female Computer Voice ] Advance " communication dish launched . " Okay , easy does it there , girl . Drag and stage . Propulsion shift . [ Laughing ] Yes ! Hey , Ace . You put this cargo down as nicely as that dish , we 're in business . You say , " Stack ' em , " I 'll say , " How high ? " Commence at your discretion , pal . I 'll be in the head . Sure . [ Alonzo ] Baines , prep cargo pods for the drop . Mmm . What the - [ Grunts ] [ Loud Grunting ] [ People Screaming ] [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Grunting ] - What 's going on ? [ Female Computer Voice ] Warning . Cargo pods won 't release ! They 're dragging us down ! Baines , unlock it ! Cut them loose . ! [ Baines ] Release mech is jammed . ! We 've picked up a heavy magnetic charge . ! [ Alonzo ] Then blow them off ! .Do it . ! - " [ Computer Voice ] Pods one , two , three . " - " [ Baines ] Charges are dead . ! " - [ Grunting ] - Ow ! Come on , Bess ! Whoa ! We 're not going down on this thing , Bess ! [ Sobbing ] We 're not dying here , Bess . Aah ! Morgan ! Morgan ! [ Computer Voice ] Warning . Evacuation warnings are in effect . [ Cries Out ] Everything will be fine . Do not panic ! Do not panic ! There 's enough room for everyone ! [ Computer ] One , two , three . Warning . [ Screams ] Evacuation warnings are in effect . True ! Where are you , girl ? True ! Bess , in ! Get in ! [ Computer Voice ] Evacuation air lock engage . Hurry ! - Hey ! Hey ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? - Morgan ! Bess ! Hold on ! - " Air lock secure . " - Don 't leave ! There 's people here ! - " Evacuation pod is engaged . " - Hey ! What are you doing ? [ Bess ] Morgan . ! Oh , my God , Morgan . !

Our Father who art in heaven , protect us with your strength as we are guided on this journey . Protect us , Lord . We need you . Dad , we 're gonna hit . ! [ Screams ] [ People Coughing ] Are you okay ? Uh , I 'm fine . Everybody , check for injuries and stay calm . We have a reading ? I 'm processing , and I can 't get anything . Don 't give me can 't ! I want an atmospheric reading . - Nothing . - [ Sighs ] [ Baines ] Sensors are down . Open the hatch . There 's nowhere else to go . We can 't stay here . That 's right . All right , everybody . Stay calm . Stay put . I 'm gonna open this damn hatch . All right . Hatch opening ! [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] Here we go . I 'm at 130 over 90 . It 's too high . I know . It 's okay . Just take a big breath . What is it ? How 's he doing ? No signal from the other crafts . Keep trying . So ? No sign of trauma . You 're clear . Thank God ! [ Chattering ] [ Man ] We 're gonna need water . Yale . Take this . Keep your eye out for anything that moves . I can 't . Weapons aversion in the Yale program ? [ Tones Resonating ] I tried to hold her . I couldn 't shake the unit . Can you hold still for a second , please ? Please ! I told you . I just wrenched it . Please just give me a minute , okay ? You 're gonna have to take 24 hours . You 've got multiple fractures here . I mean , you 're not gonna be walking until at least tomorrow . You did take a bone-healer vaccine ? It was for the colonists . I wasn 't even landing . [ Sighs ] Hey . Is - Is this dirt , Dad ? Yeah , I guess so . Cool . That 's cool . I - I don 't think this is such a good idea , Bess . - I feel like we 're gonna get arrested . - What for ? Burning wood 's been illegal on Earth since I was a kid , Morgan . Even though we burned everything else . Bess ! It 's spreading . See - Morgan , don 't worry . It 's gonna stay put . And if anyone else is alive , they 'll see our " fl " ames . [ Insect Chirping ] Yeah . You know , Bess , I think ... that we may be the only ones who made it . I - I feel awful about leaving them like that . Morgan , stop blaming yourself . You explained it . There was nothing you could do . We just broke away . The wind shear just ripped the pod right off . We 're lucky we got out alive . Thank goodness you got the door closed . Yeah . You know , you 're - you 're actually a hero . [ Grunts , Chuckles ] That is definitely one of our pod sectionals . The other 15 could be scattered all over this planet . Mmm . Pod 12 . Inventory has it with vehicles , V.T.O. aircraft and probably some clothing . What would you estimate ? Another 10 hours of darkness ? I don 't know . We 'll move at first light . Devon . It 's just so hard to believe . If this is anything like Earth was hundreds of years ago - It 's a second chance . The odds are unbelievable . Save some of that for later , pal . I am . Hmm . That 's all there is , son . Better eat it . No , thanks . Come here . Come here . I want to show you kids something . - You know what this is ? - Mm-mmm . - No . - It 's a relic from another time . What is it ? It 's money , currency . People used to trade these things for goods down on Earth ... before everyone got fund transfer codes . See ? One side is a buffalo . [ Clicks Tongue ] Other side 's an Indian head . See that ? [ Sighs ] You wanna hold this a while for me ? Uly , that 's gonna bring you some good luck on this new planet . See you . Bye-bye . You don 't like semolina , huh ? I heard a kid who choked to death on it once . Really ? So , if you 're not gonna eat it - I get it . You want something , so you decide to be nice to the freak . You 're crazy ! Want it ? Help yourself . [ Purring Sound ] [ Cooing Sound ] [ Screams ] [ Purring ] Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . I know you 're not a kitty , but what are you ? [ Giggling ] [ Chuckling ] Here you go . Want it ? Here you go . [ Giggling ] All right . All right . Watch out . Watch your step . I need to sit down for just a second . Hey . Can I help you ? Here , boy . Up you go . There . Hey . Hey . Careful . Just watch his tubing . All right . [ Purring ] There she is , people ! Oh , my God . We 've been robbed . We 're not alone . Something really picked this place clean . V.T.O. aircraft , titanium building units and probably a land vehicle . What about that other bay ? It doesn 't look like they got there . We 're not sure . No individual bay manifests . Oh , great . You manage to get that open yet ? Yeah , a couple more inches maybe . Not " one " piece of probe info showed even an inkling of civilization . No roads , no structures , no agriculture . Whatever it is , it must be interested in manufactured goods . We 've checked the last 25 years ' worth of probe reports . There 's nothing about " fl " ora and fauna . Yeah , government probes for newscast . We saw what they wanted us to see . [ Danziger ] One , two , three . ! [ Grunts ] All right . Come on . Come on . Got ' im . All right . Yeah . Looks like we got ourselves a Zero unit . Part of one anyway . [ Male Electronic Voice ] Actually , I 've got an entire body in here . Construction worker series , ready to give New Pacifica a full 100 % . Can 't speak for New Pacifica , but we could sure use the rest of your unit . Easy there , pal . Oh , boy . There 's gotta be a smarter way to do this . Hold on ! [ Danziger ] All right . Be careful . I will ! Are you in ? Yeah . Do you see the unit ? Yeah . I see it . Okay , see if you can reach the collar control panel . All right . Be careful . I will . Whoa ! It 's humming ! [ Woman ] Pull . Pull hard . Pull ! [ Man ] You need a hand up there ? Hey , kid . Wanna give me a hand ? What can I do ? [ Chuckling ] Come here , and I 'll show you . Ready ? All right . Okay ? All right . All right . All righty . Here you go . There . Now - How 's it fit ? Can you reach the pedals ? Recon rail 's your top priority , friend . I thought everybody should be mobile . That 's a good idea . All righty . She 's not much to look at , but a boy 's gotta have wheels , right ? Hey , what 'd you think ? I was gonna carry you around everywhere ? Nah , this 'll be fine . Okay . This here 's the brake . It makes you stop . Press this , that makes you go . This is where you steer . That-a-boy . Steer it like that . You have any trouble gettin ' it started , you just jiggle that a little bit and spit on it . All right ? All right . Give it a shot . All right . Take it easy now . Okay . All right . That 's good , that 's good . Just take your time . You 're doin ' good . Just take your time . All right . That-a-boy ! Whoo ! Go , go , go ! [ Claps ] That-a-boy ! Don 't forget to steer ! It 's all gone , Yale . Everything . Not everything , Devon . Most of our vehicles , communications equipment . Something 's out there , Yale , and it 's cleaned us out . We were perhaps foolish to believe there was no intelligent life here . I know . I just don 't know what to do now . People are injured . O 'Neill wants to follow those tracks , hunt down whatever creature stole our cargo . That might be imprudent , Devon . [ Beeping ] [ Loud Clanging ] [ Devon ] I 'm just worried about what might be out there . Here , kitty , kitty . Here , kitty , kitty . What 's out there is two tons of supplies and equipment , Devon , and it 's nothing more than shiny beads and trinkets to some stunted , tri-toed hominids . I don 't mean to second-guess you , Broderick , but I don 't think this - Then don 't ! It 's ours , Devon . We have every right to go out and hunt it down . True ? You ready to roll ? [ Man ] Can you bring me over a bypass hookup relay ? Ye-Yeah . [ Engine Hums ] Just be careful . [ Cooing ] [ Warning Bells Ringing ] [ Door Slides Shut ] [ Panting ] Okay , Uly . Keep breathing . And give us your best shot . Not bad . Good job , Uly . Good peak . My personal best ? Almost . Let me see you drive this thing , okay ? Why don 't you go down to that tree and back ? - Time me . - Okay . Be careful . Well , he 's no worse , considering all he 's been through . It 's not a miracle , but it 's something . All I want is to give him a chance . Nothing today suggests you can 't . [ Sighs ] [ Bird Squawking ] Nothin ' for miles . No movement . Nothing . [ O 'Neill ] These tracks head in 10 different directions . We won 't be bested by this . [ Gunshot ] What ? Hey . Maybe we oughta hold off a little . If I wanted to hold off , I 'd stayed on the station . - Commander , we don 't know what we 're dealing with ! - I know it fired my ri " fl " e , don 't I ? - [ Grunts ] - You all right ? [ Panting , Chuckles ] [ Chuckling ] Yeah . My God . Yeah . Just stings like a son of a - That little bugger 's got a - [ Moans ] He 's got a - [ Groans ] Hey . [ Moaning ] Commander ! Hey ! Oh , my God ! Oh , no , don 't . No , don 't do this ! O 'Neill ! Oh , my God . [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Yale ] Forgive us , Lord , if this ceremony lacks grace . Burial is a tradition long lost to us over generations in space . Bless our brother , Broderick O 'Neill . Be gracious to him . Lift up countenance upon him and grant him peace . Universe to universe , ashes to ashes , dust to dust . And remember to your heart our lost brethren , with whom we set forth on this mission . Protect them from evil . Amen . Children ? - I am sorry to have frightened you . - I don 't scare . - Didn 't scare me . You want to talk about what happened to Commander O 'Neill ? He 's dead . Why are they putting him into the dirt ? Come . Come , come . Sometimes we need to return to the place we think we have come from . Earth , even this new Earth , can be a place where - where life begins . And when life ends , it can be a place to rest . Are we all gonna go in the dirt , Yale ? No . No . [ Chuckles ] Not for a very long time . But we have to be very careful . We are in a new place now . Everything is different . Commander O 'Neill died because he forgot that - that even a little animal , as cute as can be , can be deadly here . You understand ? Okay . Now , I expect that if either of you see anything like this , you will stay far , far away . I will . I promise . Uh-huh . Me too . Far , far away . We dropped our communication dish here . Cargo was due to land here . But the other 15 pods could be anywhere . [ Tools Clanging ] Sweetheart , get me a number-nine anthro-scepter . So you know , I am equipped with a variety of scepters and retractors . He 's not interested . Here you go , Dad . Uh , no . Number nine , okay ? [ Devon ] Well , that settles it then . I think once we get the vehicles operational , we should head out . Mm-hmm . We wanted to be pioneers , Yale . We 've come this far . Dad ? We 're not gonna be able to go home , are we ? Excuse me . You just can 't go - Excuse me . Am I hearing this right ? Are you planning a trip or something ? We 're charting our way to New Pacifica , where we dropped our communications dish . Give me a minute with your boss here , will ya ? It 's okay . I 'm a good guy . You 're crazier than I 'd heard . You can 't just drag this group across whatever land mass this is . Half of us weren 't even supposed to set foot on this planet . And I 'm sorry for that . But we didn 't come this far to stop now . What are you , in shock , Adair ? We have crashed onto this planet . We have lost most of our cargo . I just saw a man get killed by a rodent , for crying out loud . Maybe you haven 't noticed it , but your plans have changed . New Pacifica is not the priority anymore . It certainly is a priority for 248 families on our colony ship . Twenty-six months from now they 'll be here , and I 've promised them a fully operational outpost . That 's your mission , lady . That 's " your " mission . Half of us are hired hands here . You read the risk disclosure when you took this job , and you were paid four times the standard cryo-sleep rate . And don 't you dare invoke Broderick O 'Neill 's death here . The man was my friend . It 's not about contracts or friendship . It is about survival . [ Beeping ] You want to move on ? I say you put it to a vote . Thanks for your advice , Mr " . - " Danziger . What I really need right now is a Trans Rover that 's operational . Think you can handle that ? [ Sighs ] [ Julia ] Oh , my God . ! - On the ridge , - " [ Woman ] " What is that ? - [ Shouting , Chattering ] - Uly ? Uly , where are you ? Mom ? I 'm right here , Mom . Come here , baby . Lock . Secure . Voice print . My order . [ Beeping ] Stay in there . Don 't open it . [ Beeping ] [ Screams ] What ? What is it ? Some sort of biped creatures . Oh , my God . Zero , are you there ? No indication of alien bipeds . [ Zero ] Still no indication . But they were just there , Zero . I am scanning movement over the ridge . I am picking up movement over the ridge . I 'm picking up two meters per second of motion . Two beings . Scanning at 1,700 meters . [ Zero ] Two biped creatures . - What is it ? - " I have them in range now . " They are on approach . [ Zero ] Visual feed . [ Zero ] They are alive . [ Groans ] [ Morgan ] Boy , that was bedlam , wasn 't it ? When that ship started going down , us in the clutches of gravity like that , my first thought was , you know , we 're gonna be dead . Oh . ! Real food . Mmm . ! You don 't know the sick feeling I had , Morgan and me waiting and ... the wind shear just loppin ' us right off . Oh , yeah . And the thought that we would never see any of you again - And if somebody had been trying to get in , when that auto air lock snapped shut , boy , that just would 've been - Oh , that was just - that - that was hell . Does anyone want to talk about what we saw today ? Thought we all agreed they were animals . Animals don 't carry staffs . None that we know of . Maybe it was an illusion . Tips of the rocks - What about the light ? Sun " fl " ares is just not a good-enough explanation . Let 's not make any assumptions . There 's a lot we don 't know about this place . Fine time to realize that . [ Purring ] [ Chattering ] I 'm not supposed to . They said you 're too dangerous . [ Chattering Continues ] What the hell ? [ Echoing ] What the hell ? What are you ? What do you want ? [ Responses , Echoing ] What was that ? Who said that ? [ Echoing ] What was that ? Who said that ? What is this place ? [ Echoing ] What is this place ? Please stop . What are you ? Please stop . What are you ? [ Echoing ] Leave me ! I don 't have dreams . I don 't have dreams . [ Julia ] You 're all right . You 're all right . Alonzo ? [ Whispers ] Okay , okay , okay . [ Chattering ] You can 't stay with us anymore . [ Purring ] Good-bye . Go on . Good-bye . [ Growls ] What are you doing here ? Is that one of those things that killed the commander ? Just-Just go back to camp . You 're not supposed to be out here . Yeah ? Neither are you . And those things are evil . Yale told us to stay away from them . She 's not evil " . You 're " evil ! It 's your fault you got sick and we had to come here in the first place . You 're gonna get us all killed by those things . I 'm gonna tell . No , you 're not . Hey , let go of me ! It is your fault ! Let go ! No ! Just stop ! - Aah ! Let go of me ! - Don 't ! Stop ! Look out ! We 're gonna crash ! - [ Uly Groans ] - Uly ? Hey ! Uly ? Uly , where are you ? Uly ? Uly ? [ Panting ] [ Gasping , Panting ] Uly ? I 'm coming . ! True , is that you ? True , is that you ? [ Rumbling ] Uh - Uh - Hey ! Help ! - Uly ! - Help ! - [ Screams ] - [ Screams ] This quadrant 's clear . I 'm gonna go check the ridge over here . Uly ? Uly , where are you ? Come on , Uly . Uly , answer me ! Uly ! [ Grunts ] Zero , how much further ? I have a gear reading at approximately one half meter . [ Man , Indistinct ] [ Danziger ] What - Yeah . Yeah . I got him . Yeah , this is him . I think I see him . Yeah , I got him . I got him . ! Devon . Devon . Devon ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's okay . Shh , shh . It 's all right . We 're just going about this wrong , that 's all . There 's gotta be a way in . All right , we need everyone out of here . I 'll stay here with Zero , but that 's it . Everybody else goes back to camp . I 'm not going anywhere . Hey . We 'll find your kid . Just leave me some supplies . I know how to respirate . I 'm not leaving until we find him . Okay . Keep in contact over gear . If you lose us , if you hear anything at all happen to us , pull up stakes and get the hell away from here as fast as possible . You understand me ? All right . Let 's go . People , I may have found something here . [ Zero ] Sixty-three meters , exactly . Sensors indicate a large labyrinth-like system . Will a man fit down there ? Yes . But as a Zero unit , I come with a variety of excavation accessories . Of course , they were all stolen . I 'll have you on gear the whole time , let you know everything I see . Pal , you hear me start screaming in terror , you take that as your cue to yank me out of here . Without fail , sir . [ Beeps ] Zero ? Can you track me down here ? [ Zero On Headset ] Sir , I have excellent tracking capabilities . How 's it going there , little girl ? I 'm fixing the Trans Rover . Anything I can do to help ? My name is Bess . We haven 't met yet . What 's your name ? True . And , no ... there 's nothing you can do to help . It 's not your fault , True . We 're gonna find Uly . We 're all in this together . Oh , no . They 're back . [ All Murmuring ] Oh , Lord . Morgan . Well ? What are you all waiting for ? Them to kill us too ? [ Man ] What is he doing ? Morgan , just be careful , okay ? Just - Morgan ? Morgan ! Well , there ya go . Show these things who 's boss on this planet . You idiot ! Hey , where you goin ' ? [ Danziger ] Uly . ! Uly ? Can you hear me ? This is amazing . It 's an old underground river , or an abandoned mine . Any sign ? Footprints ? Signs of struggle ? [ Danziger On Headset ] Nothing . Like it 's been empty forever . Julia ! Julia ! It 's-It 's Alonzo . He keeps calling for you . Come on . Alonzo ? You all right ? They 're Terrians . What ? They 're " Terrians " ? What did you say ? The creatures - the ones who swim up from the earth . Alonzo , are you with me ? How do you know what they 're called ? Because I talked to them . I talked to them . Devon , go back to camp and get some rest . I 'll stay . Twenty-two light-years for this . I haven 't given up hope yet . And I know you haven 't either . We 'll find him . What was I thinking , Yale ? Why did I bring all these people here ? You did not bring them , Devon . They followed you . Two hundred and fifty families still out in space will tell you that in person ... when they reach this planet . I don 't know . Maybe we had no right , Yale . Maybe we 're not supposed to go to the end of the universe to save ourselves . Maybe ... we just haven 't gotten there yet . [ Beeps ] [ Julia ] Devon ? Are you there ? I 'm on . What is it ? I think we have a way . What are you talking about ? Uly . I think we know who or what has him . We might be able to reach him . [ Beeps ] I 'm not saying I 'm sure it 's gonna work , but I think it makes the most sense . The soil on the ridge was disrupted , just like it is over here . I think they 're trying to approach us through Alonzo 's dreams . A-And you think they 're gonna try and reach us again ? I don 't know for sure . All we can do is put Alonzo to sleep and try . Hey , all I said is , I saw them in a dream . - Uly was not taken in a dream . - [ Danziger On Headset ] Guys , you up there ? What ? What is it ? I think I 'm into something here . Whoever lives down here , I don 't think it 's animals . Okay , so what are we gonna do ? I 'm going after him . I 'll take the sedative . I 'm not just sitting and waiting . I don 't have any other choice . Devon ! [ Pressurized Air Hisses ] No REM . Alonzo , this isn 't right . They approached you . You have to go with her . Uly ! [ Devon Echoing ] Uly . ! Uly ! [ Echoing ] Uly ! I 'm here , Devon . I 'm here . [ Rumbling ] My son . Where is he ? What have you done with him ? Mom ? [ Groans ] I assume you know the risks a child like Ulysses faces going into cold sleep . I 'm aware of the risks . But we don 't have much choice , now , do we ? [ Uly ] I love you , Mom . Uly ? Mom ? Mom ! Mom ! They fear us . They 're confused by us . Why ? Why are they doing this ? They 're aware Uly is special , different . The abduction is an attempt to understand us through him . This dream plane is real . It is the only way they can reach us . Uly ! Uly ! Uly ? Uly ! Uly ! Uly ! [ Sobs ] [ Sobs ] Uly ! [ Echoing ] [ Overlapping Voices , Whispered Murmurs ] [ Murmuring Continues ] They claim we 've been here before , this planet . What ? What are they talking about ? We 've never been here before . Never ! [ Muted Lowing ] They fear we 're evil . We 've left our mark on the planet already . [ Lowing , Murmuring ] No , we came here for life , for a chance to live . [ Echoing ] No , we came here for life , for a chance to live . [ Trilling ] Uly 's return is not a gift . It would have a price . Wh-What is it ? Tell us what it is . Anything . ! Devon - Devon , it 's not our fight . I don 't care . I will do anything . I will give you my life for my son 's . Please . [ Trilling , Murmuring ] Devon , it is different for them . What are they doing ? Tell them to stop ! My son ! My son . ! [ Murmuring , Lowing ] [ Groaning ] What ? What do you want ? What are you asking ? Uly ! Uly . Man ! Oh , boy . Come here . Devon , how you feeling ? You all right ? What happened ? I don 't know . Well , where are you going ? Devon ? Mom ! Uly . ! I 'm right here , Mom ! I 'm okay . Oh ! Uly ! [ Sobbing ] Are you okay ? Oh , God . [ Sobbing Continues ] Oh , my baby . If we can average 20 kilometers a day , we can make it to New Pacifica in nine months - or at least what we used to think of as months - and we will still have 17 months to prepare for our colonists . It won 't be easy , and I don 't understand this new world better than any of you , but I know New Pacifica is here , and I know somehow we 'll be all right there . I think we 've all seen something here that can help us believe that . So that 's it . You think we should just take off . Just like that . No . I think we should take a vote . [ Devon Narrating ] We came to this planet a group of strangers , and now we head out , still strangers , but united toward a single purpose - braving this new land . Four days ago , aliens landed on a distant planet , and we are them . Now we struggle across an unknown planet , an uncharted world , looking all the while for that moment when we must fulfill our promise ... and wondering ... what will stand in our way . I don 't know , Devon . I don 't know what kind of promise we made , what kind of price we 're gonna have to pay . I don 't either , but I know I 'd make it again .

 Hall with a nice left . Hall just trying to stay away from him . Come on , man . Come on . Come on now . Put him down . Put him down ! Oh ! Hey , man , watch it . Hey , come on , Upshaw . Come on , you and me , buddy , let 's go . - You 're a moron , Tiernan . - Let 's go . You 're both morons , as far as I 'm concerned . Now , who 's watching the floor ? What 's-his-name , the skink . Hey , guess who died this afternoon . Mrs. Richardson . Face plant right in a bowl of pudding . I don 't suppose either one of you bothered to change her room . Oh , no , no . We left that for you . Oh ! Now Hall 's against the ropes and trying to work ... Okay . Party 's over , gents . Why 'd you do that ? 'Cause rules are rules , Stan . And I 'm the queen bitch around here . Gung said we could watch the rest of the fight . Yeah ? Well , do I look like Gung to you ? No . You got a better figure . You want to keep that hand , Hal , you better let go . How about a little sponge bath ? How about I take care of these wandering hands of yours ? Come here . You like strapping me down , don 't you ? Oh , yeah . I really get off on it . Hey , Gung . No TV after 9 : 00 , do you understand ? Dr. Grago said they 're getting better , so ... Oh , getting better ? Right . That 's because they don 't pinch his butt every time he walks into the room . No ! Somebody , help me ! Somebody , please ! Please ! Help me ! Please , help me ! Good morning . Whatever tape you found in that VCR , it isn 't mine . Good . Because I put it back in that drawer with all those other videos that aren 't yours . Well , this definitely isn 't mine . No . This is Michelle Charters . She 's a registered nurse at a convalescent home in Worcester , Massachusetts . What happened to her ? According to Miss Charters , she was raped . The abrasions and contusions here would be consistent with her claims , as would be the medical report , which cites the kind of injury and tearing associated with sexual trauma . Where 'd you get this , Violent Crimes ? No . The woman made the video herself . It seems that no one will believe her story . Why not ? Because she claims to have been raped by an invisible entity . A spirit being . I have several X Files that document similar cases . I know . I 've been here since 6 : 00 this morning going through them . Well , then you know none of them have ever been substantiated . - Not surprisingly . - Well , given the emotional and psychological violence of rape , the face or identity of the attacker is often blurred or erased from memory . That he could be perceived as invisible is a logical leap from there . Yes , but this case is different . Why ? The victim has filed a lawsuit against the federal government . She seems to be certain who the spirit being is . Mr. Arden . Hal Arden . And you know him ... ? He 's been a patient where I work for about five years . Miss Charters , the facts of your case seem to contravene those of other cases we have on file . Right . You mean the other " woman raped by invisible man " cases ? How do you know it was him who attacked you ? He made advances toward me . And he said things- - rude things . Look , when you bathe somebody every day for five years , you get to know more about them than you really need to . And an old man smells a certain way , and he feels a certain way . I know this is hard for you . No , this is the easy part . See , hard is not being able to get disability leave or workman 's comp and having to go back to work with this ... guy . To continue our investigation , we 're going to need some kind of evidence- physical or ... - Yeah , yeah , yeah . I know . I 've heard it . Unless you have hair or semen or fibers or whatever , you guys can 't build a case . That 's right . Look , I didn 't make this up , okay ? I was attacked . And I 'm not some kind of shrinking violet who would repress the memory of a rapist 's face . If I could positively I.D. him or give you something to incriminate the man , I would . You got to be kidding me . And what do I think about her claims ? I should be in the Guinness record book . Hey , I 'm 74 years old . I 've got plumbing older than this building . Hmm ? And it don 't work much better either . Thank you for sharing . Are you ... are you aware that you 're being named in a lawsuit against the federal government ? I am ? Did you ever threaten Miss Charters ? What ? Did you ever threaten Miss Charters ? Threaten ? It was harmless , for crying out loud . Ever since this sex harassment fad , men can 't say what 's on their minds . She says you made advances . Hmm ? Advances ? If I told you you were a very pretty woman and I would like to show you some affection , would you be offended ? Huh ? Oh , I didn 't mean to step on your toes there . It 's all right . There-there seems to be some confusion here . Yeah . I thought Nurse What 's-her-name said she was rogered by a ghost . I may have one foot in the grave , but I certainly can 't fly down hallways spreading amore . Apparently not . If that 's what it 's like ... if that 's what it 's like in heaven , Lord , take me now . What do you think , Mulder ? About the guy 's plumbing ? About his story . I think this is gonna turn out to be a huge waste of time , just like all the other X Files on entity rape . Unsubstantiated phenomena . But in a substantiated crime . Hey , pay attention . Or you can take another bath with your clothes on . Five and a half bucks an hour- - I don 't give a rat 's ass either way . Ten years ago , Excelsis was a leading facility in care and treatment of the elderly . Then government funding was cut till we were all but shut down . Only a few wings are operational now . Is there still a medical staff ? Not on site . Dr. Grago visits three times a week . Excelsis residents are very well looked after though . We hold ourselves to a high standard of health maintenance and treatment . What kind of treatment ? We 've always specialized in the care of the late-life degenerative diseases- - Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's . We met with a patient today . We prefer " resident , " actually . We met a " resident " today who was described to us as having Alzheimer 's , but he actually seemed quite spry and alert . You 're speaking of Hal Arden , the man accused of assaulting Michelle Charters . Was he receiving special treatment ? You 'd have to speak to Dr. Grago . Hal has been here almost eight years now . We 're all quite fond of him . We were extremely dismayed over this whole business with the lawsuit . Are you saying that you don 't believe Nurse Charter 's allegations of rape ? There 's something I 'd like to show you . What did you tell them ? I didn 't tell them anything . Why are they still here ? I don 't know , Stan . Now , you got to be more careful . I am careful . You 're going to ruin it for all of us . They find out , it all goes for nothing . I didn 't tell them anything . I 'm not going to die in this godforsaken hole , do you hear me ? Oh , bug off , Stan . Where did you get that ? I know where he keeps them . Give me one , Stan . Huh ? I want another one , too . You can 't handle another one . Oh , yeah ? Maybe I 'll just rat you out then . Huh ? How would you like that ? This Michelle Charters ' ? There are three separate insurance claims for accidents received on the job . In April , she went to the state board and requested leave with full pay due to job-related emotional stress . The request was summarily rejected . There 's more ... I 'd like to review it myself , if that 's okay . Certainly . Ms. Dawson , did you get a chance to see Michelle after the incident , to see the extent of her injuries ? I wasn 't here the night it happened , but I did see her the following day . Then you know how badly she was hurt . Yes . In your opinion , do you think she staged the attack ? Excuse me , Ms. Dawson ? We need help ! Mr. Arden 's choking to death . See ? See what happened ? I told you you couldn 't handle any more . Call 911 . Hal ? Can you speak ? I think this man 's in ventricular fibrillation . I need 75 milligrams of lidocaine and one amp of amphinephrine . - Stat . - Yeah . - And get me a defibrillator ! - Okay ! He 's turning cyanotic . Come on , Hal , you got to help me . Come on , Hal . One , two , three , four . The ambulance is on the way . I 'm losing him . What 's taking them so long ? ! Still no pulse . Where 's that crash cart ? ! Hal Arden 's been my patient since he came here eight years ago . This really is a setback . A setback ? Hal was part of a group of Alzheimer 's patients I 've been treating for the past 11 months . But Alzheimer 's isn 't treatable . It 's an experimental drug called Depranil- - an enzyme inhibitor that increases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain . I 've read about it , but I 've also read that the clinical benefits are marginal at best . Yes , but these patients seem to be proving otherwise . They 've demonstrated cognitive abilities well beyond anything that 's been reported . So he was actually getting better ? Before he started receiving the drug , he could hardly complete a sentence . Look , um , there 's not much to get excited about in my work . You know , most of these people are on the downhill slide . If I can make them comfortable , maybe prolong a life , that 's about all they expect . But to reverse an illness ... Would it be possible for us to take a look at other patients in your test group ? Sure , if you want to . Yeah . Where 'd you get that ? Oh , it was Hal 's . Since he 's not here anymore , why can 't I have it ? Because you have enough . What I give you is enough . It 's our secret . Oh , come on , Gung . It 's making me better . Too much is very bad . Very bad . No more for you . I want you to stand behind Ben , Eddie , because Ben 's taller . And , uh , oh , Gloria , would you come on over here ? That man there- - that 's Leo Kreutzer . During the Depression , he was a WPA artist . Quite a good one , too , I 'm told . Hello , Mabel . Oh , don 't you look lovely today . Is he receiving the same treatment as Hal Arden ? Yes . When he came to us , he couldn 't draw a circle . Now , well , you can see for yourself . Because you 're taller , I want you to stand behind Ben . Uh , you 'll have to excuse me . I 'm already well behind on rounds . Can I get a copy of Hal Arden 's autopsy results ? - Of course . - Thank you . May I sit down , Leo ? Leo , we 're with the FBI . We have some questions that we 'd like to ask you . Leo 's a brilliant artist , you know . Oh , don 't be so modest , Leo . President Kennedy has one of his paintings in the White House . Dr. Grago tells us that you haven 't been able to work in years . That the medicine has improved your ... Ain 't the medication . What is it then ? Okay , Rembrandt , 6 : 00 , dinner time . Come on , Dorothy , legs up and straight ahead . I don 't want you getting a flat tire . Wait , L-Leo 's not finished with us . Well , Leo can finish with you later . No , no , he still ... he still has to draw the rest . - He 'll do it later , honey . - Come on , Leo . Don 't make me embarrass you in front of your friends . Come on , Scully , let 's get out of here . To find not just a treatment , but a cure for Alzheimer 's- - Mulder , do you realize how important that would be ? Well , if it 'd keep anybody out of a place like that , it 'd be important enough . I wouldn 't say any of those people were exactly cured . Well , any progress at all ... Well , I hope somebody 's making some progress , 'cause we 're going home with a big goose egg . Checking out of room 206 and 210 , please . Certainly , sir . Angelo ? What if there 's a connection ? Between the rape case and the Alzheimer 's ? You mean , when they 're not drawing child-like pictures , they 're brutal sex offenders ? Well , Dr. Grago 's drug therapy produces acetylcholine . Too much cholinergic activity has been shown to cause a psychotic state very similar to schizophrenia . So you think that Michelle Charters was raped by a 74-year-old schizophrenic ? It 's possible . An invisible 74-year-old schizophrenic ? Well , maybe it 's not in the medication . Maybe it 's the place itself . Are you saying that the building 's haunted ? Because if you are , I think you 've been working with me for too long , Scully . I-I 'm talking about an environmental reason behind what 's happening there . Even the disinfectant couldn 't mask that smell . Who knows what 's breeding behind the walls or in the substructure ? Some fungal contaminates have been known to cause delusions , dementia , violent behavior ... Why wouldn 't it have affected the other residents ? Maybe it has . I-I think you 're looking too hard , Scully , for something that 's not there . I think that Michelle Charters concocted this story to get out of a job she hates . Her lip required 13 stitches . The blow to her head resulted in a subdural hematoma . That 's quite a concoction . Look , I just want to talk to a few more of the patients there . We can catch the same flight out tomorrow night . This is gourmet fare . Now , be a good girl and open wide . No , no , no , please don 't . - Come on . Come on . - Please don 't . Come on , open up , honey . Come on . - No , please don 't . - Open up . - I don 't want ... - There we go . Hey , that 's fine , Dorothy , starve to death . See if I care . Why aren 't you eating your food , Leo ? What 's the matter ? It 's Dorothy . She needs more . We both do . What you have is enough . It 's not working for us . Not like it works for the others . We need more . No . Now , eat your food , please . I 'll come back and pick up your tray . It 's okay , Dorothy . Don 't worry . I think Stan has some more hidden away somewhere . It 'll be all right . Why are you being so stubborn ? I 'm not ! I happen to like it here . A year ago , you were practically begging to come and live with us . - Well , things change . - Look , Dad , I am sorry about what happened to Mr. Arlen . Arden . His name was Arden . I 'm just about finished packing your things , Mr. Phillips . Well , I 'm going to make sure y-you didn 't forget anything . Okay . Don 't you worry , Mrs. Kelly . You just pull your car out front . I 'll make sure he gets down okay . Thank you . He 's going to be just fine . Can I help you ? Yes , we 'd like to have a word with Mr. Phillips . I 'm his daughter . What is this about ? We 're with the FBI . We , uh , have a few questions concerning his medical treatment . He 's in there packing right now . I 'm about to take him home . Is there anything I can help you with ? It 's sad . My two little girls won 't even visit their grandfather . They 're too afraid to even come here . It 's hard for anyone to be here , including the residents . That 's why Jack and I decided that no matter what time he 's got left , we want him to spend it with us . How many years has he been here ? Almost three . But we didn 't have any choice . Jack and I both work . The doctor said that he needed 24-hour nursing assistance . He doesn 't seem to need much assistance now . Has his improvement been that pronounced ? I thought I was bringing him here to die . They told me he 'd only get worse . The physical deterioration , the dementia . And now it 's like ... like he 's a different person . Do you have any idea why ? I suppose it has something to do with Dr. Grago 's treatment . Dad won 't talk to me about it . He 's just too angry . Oh , he was so angry when I brought him here in the first place , and now he 's angry that I want to take him home . I don 't know that he 's ever going to forgive me . You know , I 'd like to say I 'm going to miss you , Stan , but the truth is , you are a royal pain in the butt . Hey ! Where you going ? ! Don 't make me chase you , old man . Hey ! What are you , a track star , all of a sudden ? Okay , stop messing around , Stan . You crawl back in that window right now . You crawl back in there . Don 't think I 'm coming over there to get you . I 'd just as soon let you fall and break your neck . Do you hear me , Stan ? ! You hear me ? ! Help me ! Somebody help me , please ! I 'm going to fall ! Help ! Help me ! Give me your hand . - Come on . - I can 't . Come on ! - Grab it . - I can 't ! Oh , my God . They paged me this morning . I got a message an orderly fell - out a fourth-floor window ? - Apparently . Either that or he was pushed . Was Stan involved ? That 's what we 're trying to determine . Stan was with him just prior to the accident . You 're not suggesting he could have done it ? There have been two deaths here in the past 24 hours . Stan 's been present before both of them . No , no . That 's impossible . Stan Phillips has a degenerative hip disease . There 's no way he could even get up to - the fourth floor on his own . - What about an elevator ? The elevators in this place haven 't worked for years . Maybe he was helped . Helped ? By whom ? I don 't know . Uh , the postmortem on Hal Arden- - did you get it yet ? No , not yet , but they promise they 'll fax it to me today . Can we check and see if it 's come in ? Sure . Just what do you expect to find ? I 'm not sure exactly . Why are they questioning him ? It 's routine procedure . Are they going to want to keep him here ? You 'll have to ask Dr. Grago . I ... God . If my mother was alive ... Well , how am I supposed to handle the whole floor by myself ? I don 't know , Michelle . I have other things - to deal with right now . - Yes , well , so do I , - and I would just like some help , please . - Excuse me . Are you the only one on ? Yes . Upshaw never showed up for work last night . I mean , nobody 's ever listening to me around here . I said there was something going on , and I told you it had to do with Mr. Arden and Mr. Phillips . Just forget it . Can you please explain to me what 's going on around here ? Shoo ! Shoo ! Go away ! Go , go away ! Leave me alone ! Go back ! Don 't come any closer ! Go back in your room , Dorothy . If you need something , I 'll send an orderly in to see you . No , no , th-they 're in there . Who ? All of them . There 's nobody in your room , Dorothy . Here they come . You 'll see . All right , now , y-you be nice . I don 't want any more of your dirty tricks . Is she going to be all right ? No ! No , no , no , no , I don 't want to go back in there ! No ! No , I don 't want to go back in there . It 's senile dementia . This is just an episode . You leave her be . D-Don 't you touch her . Now , shoo ! Go away , go away , go away ! Don 't you get any ideas , mister . Excuse me . Now don 't you follow her ! This is it . Is the toxicology there ? Yes . There 's something here that shouldn 't be here . What 's that ? Ibotenic acid . How did that get in his blood ? What 's ibotenic acid ? If I 'm not mistaken , I think it 's a kind of poison . Mulder ... Scully , look at this . Hal Arden had ibotenic acid in his blood . Somebody poisoned him . Well , not necessarily . This is only a trace amount . But small amounts have been known to cause hallucinations , which is what one of your patients is having right now down the hall . But where did they get it ? Excuse me . You 've got to come quickly . Oh , my God . It 's fantastic . What 's going on here ? Leo ? It 's incredible . You 've got an Asian orderly working here . What 's his name ? Uh , Gung , I think . Do you know where he is ? Somewhere down in the basement . Upshaw . You must believe me . I didn 't kill him . But it 's your mushroom crop , isn 't it ? Yes . Well , who else would have buried him there ? Why were you growing them ? For medicinal purposes . Were you feeding them to the residents here ? Yes , but only in small amounts . Why ? Because it makes them feel better . Makes them feel better or it kills them ? No . Exactly what kind of mushrooms are they ? It 's from my prefecture in my country . They 've been used for centuries . For what purpose ? In my country , our customs are different . You 're not in your country now . You 're hired here to care for these people under our guidelines . Where I come from , many generations live under one roof . As children , our grandparents live with us . We feel a duty to take care of them . It isn 't like that in this country . We respect our old people as we respect our ancestors . We don 't send them away to die like Stan and Hal . These people are given excellent medical care . But they 're not treated with respect . Hal 's family never came to visit him once . And the orderlies treat the residents worse than dogs . No one is mistreated here . You 're not here to see . All right , Gung , who killed the orderly ? Who buried him in that room ? Something has gone very wrong . The mushrooms we take to speak with the dead , to see our ancestors in the spirit world . But ... the spirit in this place is very angry , and the souls that died here continue to suffer . And now they ... have been awakened . Are you saying that a spirit killed this man Upshaw ? Yes . They 've taken revenge for their mistreatment . How are the mushrooms taken ? Dried , mixed with many herbs , made into powder . Well , I think the first thing we should do is make sure nobody else takes them . You check on the other patients . Gung , come with me . Let 's go . Come in , please . Someone 's taken them all . - I think you 're right , Scully . - About ? What 's been happening here is the result of the medication , but not the medication the doctor 's been giving them . Mulder , mushrooms aren 't medication . They taste good on hamburgers , but they don 't raise the dead . Shamans have been using them for centuries to gain entrance to the spirit world . I think you 've been reading too much Carlos Castenada . Ask any anthropologist then . I know . A shaman gets intoxicated , he has dreams or hallucinations , and he interprets them . I don 't think it 's any more magical than that . I don 't know how else to explain what 's happening here . Well , I think , if anything , these mushrooms are a poison to the system , and I think that 's what killed Hal Arden . And raped Michelle Charters and killed those two orderlies ? Something 's been unleashed here , Scully . I don 't know how to explain it , but it has something to do with those pills . Daddy ? Daddy , what are you taking ? What are you putting in your mouth ? Go away ! You go away ! Go away ! Go away ! You leave me ... Leave us alone ! Go on ! You ... run . Run while you can . Go on , run . Run . Go away . Go away ! You leave us alone . Go on . Dorothy , I need your help ! Leo ! You leave Leo alone ! You leave him alone ! Leo ! Leo ! Leo ... go on . Go on . You leave him ... You leave ... Oh ... oh , n-no . S-Stop . Stop that ! Help ! Help me , please . Mulder ? ! What 's going on ? ! Mulder ? ! Mulder ? ! Scully ! Turn off the water main ! Turn off the water main ! They 're trapped in the bathroom , and it 's filling with water . What ? Where 's the main water shutoff ? I don 't know . Gung will know . Keep trying the door . You 've got to get up . Come on , you got to get up . It 's stuck . See if you can find something to force it with . Okay . I can 't open the drains . Please ! Please , my father needs help . My father took something . I 'm afraid he 's dying . You stay with him . I 'll get help . Dr. Grago ! Dr. Grago . It 's sealed tight . Do you have any atropine in your kit here ? Uh , I might . Yes , I think so . Stan Phillips has gone into convulsions . I think he might have poisoned himself . It 's all right . Just hold on . They 're gone . They 're gone . They 're all gone . You okay , Mulder ? Yeah . Fine . In response to the series of unexplained incidents at the Excelsis Dei Convalescent Home , the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has assumed all administrative authority at the facility . They 've detected trace amounts of ibotenic acid in more than half the residents tested , though these levels have dissipated rapidly . Dr. John Grago has been replaced as head physician at the facility , and his trial use of the drug Depranil has been suspended . For his admitted part in manufacturing and distributing an elicit substance , Gung Bituen was remanded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , and is awaiting repatriation to Malaysia . There are reportedly no efforts being made to study the mushrooms . The federal government has settled Michelle Charters' lawsuit out of court , though no clear blame has been placed . Witnesses to the events have been unreliable due to dramatic relapses and a general reversal in their progress with Alzheimer 's disease . I 'm going to go now , Daddy . I 'll see you again soon . Maybe next week . I made this !

 Last week on Wild Palms : I want you to set up an exchange . The chip for Deirdre . He killed Grace . He 's got my daughter . You 've got to tell the senator about the Go-chip . One day , I 'll put out the sun and make bare every womb there ever was . You wanna be a samurai , Harry ? Now 's your chance . I want you to put this on live feed . Turn it off ! This is for Grace Wyckoff ! Come on ! Move it ! Our fearful trip is done The ship has weather 'd every rack The prize we sought is won I 'd like to acknowledge the efforts of one among us . Harry Wyckoff . How does it feel to be a leader , Harry ? Viva Zapata . You wanna know how I really feel ? Sick . Violated . Like I killed Grace a second time on television . It got results . Eli , they should have moved you right from the Perceptory to Channel 3 . You would 've made a hell of a programmer , you know that ? It was a terrible thing , Harry , but it opened people 's eyes . Grace would have demanded that . Don 't tell me what Grace would 've demanded . You don 't know anything about her . - What do you want from me ? - Deirdre . Kreutzer said he would give her back if we gave him the Go-chip . - I can 't do that , Harry . - Why ? Because with the chip , he 'll be immortal . A holographic vampire , unstoppable from some unspeakable unreachable place . He 'll organize the death of the world . You 're as crazy as he is ! - Oh , listen to me Harry . - No , listen to me ! I 'm gonna have my family back one way or the other . Do you understand that , Eli ? And those are my politics ! And you can go to hell . And then , now I 'd like to say a few words . Hello I must be going I cannot stay I came to say , I must be going I 'm glad I came , but just the same I must be going What is it , doc ? A heart attack or indigestion ? Stress of the last few days . You 're acutely hypertensive . - I 'd like to put you in Cedars . - No . - No hospitals . - I can 't force you . I 'm gonna medicate you . I want you to stay in bed . No alcohol or Mimezine . You 're no fun . Grindrod . What about the Go-chip ? If I can get your pressure under control you 've got maybe a week or so . After that , I can 't say what your body will tolerate . A week , huh ? Grindrod ! Why haven 't you bailed Josie ? We 're trying . My sister ? In jail ? What 's the matter with you ? Get her out if you have to break her out ! We 'll never contain this , Papa . It 's a fiasco . Where 's the murder tape ? Being treated at the lab . Even the die-hard New Realists think Josie 's guilty . They 're running scared . Then straighten them out . You knew Harry was going to bust into Channel 3 , didn 't you ? No . You knew he was going to use that tape . Why , Paige ? Am I a handsome man ? Am I a virile man ? - Answer me . - Tony , please . Am I a decrepit cuckold ? Stop it . You were supposed to come back with the Go-chip . Instead you brought a plague to my house . You 're hurting me . Hello I must be going I cannot stay I came to say I must be going I 'll go back . I 'll get Harry to hand it over . I assure you I did not come all this way to die like a trapped wolf ! Like a circus dog ! I am a soldier ! I am mustering my troops and we are storming heaven ! - Why 'd you kill her , Josie ? - How 'd you make bail ? - I didn 't kill anyone . - There was a doctored tape . A fabrication . In a few days we 'll prove it . Is your brother gonna choose a new running mate ? - Will he drop out of the campaign ? - Absolutely not . Why should he ? - What 's your defense ? - Not guilty . But the whole country saw you murdered you daughter . Seeing is believing . You must be kidding . - One more question , Josie . - Will there be a statement from you ? When will the tape be ready ? - Tonight . - And the Go-chip ? I 'm assuming Harry Wyckoff has it in his possession . Get word out in the Wilderzone . If he doesn 't turn it over within 48 hours we 'll kill the little girl . Honey ? I 'm home ! Coty 's room . I always wanted to see what his room looked like . It would have been mine . Help me out , Peter . Why did the Fathers take you from Grace and me ? - What do you know ? - They steal children dreams , memories . A regular fire sale . When they say , " Everything must go , " they aren 't kidding . Why me ? Why my family ? You really don 't know , do you ? Let 's talk to the source . Wild Palms ? Should we take the car or the pool ? Schenkl . How could I have been so stupid ? How did they get Josie out ? When are we releasing the tape ? Tomorrow morning . CNN , all the networks . Channel 3 will run it round the clock . Do you think I should do a feature during hiatus ? - Deirdre . - No , wait . Wait . Hi , sweetie . Hey , Dad , can we see the tape ? Tabba , take Deirdre to the house . Come on , little darling . Tabba is gonna read you a story . My God . Please don 't hit me , Harry ! You 're just like your mother . Don 't look . Don 't look . Get up ! What are you gonna do with me ? The Fathers must be stopped . - And you 're one of them . - No ! I 'm just a woman . But the Fathers are good , Harry . They want to bring freedom of images to the people . As leader of the Friends , I must set an example . - You must die . - No , please , Harry . Don 't hurt me . Long live the Friends . Death to New Realism . Long live the revolution . - The images are no-good . - Get out of here . The images don 't hold . You 're diluting the images . - Help you out today ? - No , thanks . Got some kung fu , some Johnny Carson . Some bloopers from Church Windows . How about some holotropics ? Fugu just flown in . - I got some Mimezine , Imagithol - - Not today . Say , you 're the painter , right ? Sorry to hear about your friend . Awful what happened . We 're seeing more and more of that these days . They call it image sickness . I don 't approve of drug dealers . I don 't even like the way you smell . - Save your condolences . - You know , I 've been looking for you . - Get the hell out of my face . - You 've got friends in high places . They heard about your loss . They made something for you . To get you through the night . It 's your friend Tommy . Come inside . I 'll play it for you . Come on , Twenty-Twenty , you 're gonna like what you see . Continuing violence in the wake of today 's allegations of doctored holotapes and conspiracy . A Channel 3 engineer has been arrested in the bizarre case and Harry Wyckoff , the disgruntled head of business affairs turned revolutionary , is now being sought in the murder of his wife . Only one week ago , the nation was shocked when Church Windows was interrupted by a - - Get up ! - Please don 't hit me , Harry . You 're just like your mother . I 'm worried about my brother . - Emotionally ? - Physically . I talked to the doctors . What if his body rejects the Go-chip , Tobias ? What if it kills him ? It 's all been the emperor 's new mind ? Never gonna happen . You know your brother , Josie . He hasn 't come this far just to let a little thing like the body get in his way . What will the senator be like after the transference ? Ghostly . He 'll look like himself ? Like a hologram . He 'll be able to reach into our dreams . By then , half the world will be on Mimezine . He 'll be like Christ . This better be good . It 's Mr. Wyckoff on the holophone . Well , well . If it isn 't America 's most wanted . Well , I hope I didn 't catch you at a bad time . I wanted to tell you you did a hell of a job on that tape of Grace and me . I knew you 'd appreciate it . The television programmer in me was screaming : " This could be a hit ! " Kill a mystery guest off every week . Start historically . One week , kill Caesar . The next , Hoffa . " Death to New Realism . Long live the revolution . " Who wrote that dialogue ? Did you think someone would believe it ? Does it matter ? We 're already climbing again in the polls . Don 't you get it ? No one gives a damn . I want my daughter back , Josie . Does the senator still wanna make a deal ? - You have it ? - The Go-chip ? - Tell me where to bring it . - Japantown . Sunday , 4 : 00 . The Festival of the Ghosts . Schenkl , you sick animal . Don 't project on me , Harry . All those years ... You used everything I told you . How many died ? If I ever get my hands on you , Schenkl I 'm gonna just rip your neck out ! Oh , please , Harry , stop the adolescent posturing . Four o 'clock , Sunday . Ciao . What 's this ? The Go-chip . When they took it from your hand , we embedded it in the coating . The wedding band that Josie gave me . - I like the irony . - Why now , Eli ? The word on the street is that someone 's gonna hit the senator . Soon . Tell them I don 't want anything to happen to him until I get Deirdre . - I can 't control that . - Well , you 've got to try . What 's the matter ? - What ? - It 's the Mimezine . Schenkl must have overdosed you at the Perceptory . Choko ! Now , come on , I still have some of the antigen . Who is that sitting on my bed ? It feels like you . Smells like you . Is it a horror ? To be gotten through the night by something made at Mimecom ? Is it a horror ? Hey , Tully , come on . Stop painting , will you ? We 're gonna be late . It 's the Fourth of July . They 're making bonfires on the beach . If there is a God , forgive me . For I am lonely , and I am blind . Hold me . Tommy ? Tully , come on . Stop painting , will you ? - We 're gonna be late . - Tommy , don 't leave me . They 're making bonfires on the beach . Tommy . Tommy . I need more tapes . I need more tapes . Hey , Twenty-Twenty , back so soon ? I need more tapes . You gonna start paying for these , Twenty-Twenty ? I 'm strapped today , maybe next time . I 'm out of Tommy tapes . Don 't cut me off ! - You 'll get your money today . - I said , I 'm out . Look , a friend of yours came by today . I think she might be able to help you . Who ? A lady , said she 'd be over at the Mimoplex . I think she got some tapes . She 'll fix you up , Twenty-Twenty . Fix you up real good . Sarah , it 's Rauch . You need help . You can 't hide in the Wilderzone forever . Leave me alone ! Let me in , Sarah . They 're looking for you . - They ' re gonna kill you . - Liar . - I don 't believe you . - Hello , Tully . - Don 't panic , I 'm not going to hurt you . - You ... You really see with those things . Yes . - And with the Mimezine . - Phenomenal . I 'm so glad . I brought some Tommy tapes for you . Very high quality . I thought it would be better I gave them to you myself . That disgusting girl in the Wilderzone keeps diluting the images . That 's why you can only watch them once . Why are you doing this ? I 'm making amends . There is something you could do for me . I 've been looking for Eli Levitt . No . I understand he 's preparing to assassinate my brother . Don 't make me . I love my brother very much . As much as you love Tommy . He 's in the Wilderzone . That 's where you 'll find Eli Levitt . I 'm giving you one more chance . I 'm gonna give you all the tapes that you need . Don 't do it , Harry . Give me a reason , Tobias . There are still things you need to know . Don 't do it . Everything I need to know is in my right hand . If you kill me , you 'll never see Deirdre again . It 's not safe for you to be out and about . Nothing 's gonna happen to me as long as I have the Go-chip . Why don 't you lay down on the couch , Harry . - Just like old times . - Shut up . Tell me what you know about the Go-chip . What will happen when I give it to the senator ? - He will become immortal . - Impossible . Do you know what paradise is , Harry ? No longer encumbered by the body . Whatever you imagine is made real before you . That 's the Go-chip . What your father , Dex , only dreamed about . You 're insane . All of you ! Too many of us now , Harry . Synthiotics is worldwide . When the election is over we will enslave those who aren 't with us . In a thousand Manzanars . What 's the matter , Harry ? Cat got your mind ? Are you okay ? What happened ? They found you in the ' Vette on the street . What happened to you ? Oh , just a heavy session with my shrink . - Choko 's been working on you . - That 's comforting . She says you have the sickness , but you 're not gonna die . Terrific . Does the senator know you 're here ? I couldn 't stay with him anymore . You know , I can go for a major martini right about now . Do you have any green olives ? No alcohol . Okay . Okay . Yes . Oh , she 's a scary thing , isn 't she ? It 's good to see you . Why the double ring ? It 's a long story . Let 's get out of here . Where ? Need to see some blue sky . I open my eyes in the morning and I think , " Is what I 'm seeing real ? " That 's my first thought of the day . What 's real , Paige ? Can you tell me ? Deirdre 's real . Peter 's real . We are . - Do you feel like traveling ? - Yes . You know , we could fly away somewhere . Or live in a big old house up in the mountains . That 's what Grace always wanted to do . I wanna find a Norman Rockwell-type town , you know . With maple trees and park benches and shiny red fire engines . A decent place . Where people respect reality . Ask her if this can also be used for image sickness . Get in there ! Come on ! Move it ! I 've been searching for you . Shotgun wedding , Josie ? More a baptism . Know who told me where to find you ? Your old artist-in-arms , Tully Woiwode . - I don 't believe that . - Scout 's honor . Called me up , all by himself . Even told me about the Go-chip . Hidden in the wedding ring I gave you . Is nothing sacred , Eli ? - You won 't win , Josie . - Hungry , Eli ? You 'll love the food here . Soup 's a little watery . You 're sick . You didn 't think I 'd let you kill my brother , did you ? Show Mr. Levitt to his table . Get up . I 'll see you in hell , Josie . I was going to suggest some wine , but I don 't think it 's a good idea . One should never drink and drown . And you are the designated drowner . Goodbye , Eli . It could have been so good with us . So good . They went up overnight . Thousands of them . Start the revolution without me . - What time is the rendezvous ? - Four o 'clock . Harry , I wanna come . - No . - I 'm still the senator 's wife . They 'll be less likely to pull anything if I 'm there . Schenkl . Where 's my daughter ? Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Do we leave the girl ? - No ! Change of plans . Move ! Move ! Deirdre ! Deirdre ! Are you okay ? - Yeah . - You 're bleeding . - The ring . - What ? Eli 's ring . And the Go-chip . They got the Go-chip . Damn it ! The whole world is watching ! The whole world is dreaming ! The whole world is watching ! The whole world is dreaming ! The whole world is watching ! The whole world is dreaming ! The whole world is watching ! The whole world is dreaming ! The whole world is watching ! The whole world is dreaming ! The whole world is watching ! The whole world ... Harry , Eli 's dead . They 've called a war meeting at MacArthur Park . They 're going to attack Channel 3 and the lab at Mimecom . Where 's the senator ? There 's a surgical suite at Wild Palms . That 's where they did the procedure . I 'm going to get Deirdre . I 'll come back for you and Peter . I 've come all this way for you . I 'm not gonna be left behind . Not now . - Where 's Tully ? - No one knows . We 're afraid he 's been picked up . - Come on . - Come on ! Hello , Tully . Been a long time . Probably not feeling too good about yourself . After what they did to Eli . I am asking you to kill me . I saved your father 's life once now you can cash me out . This isn 't Vegas , Tully . Eli Levitt was my friend . I am lower than the lowest of animals . You want redemption for what you did , don 't you ? There is a way to pay back the woman who did this to you . You 'd like that , wouldn 't you , Tully ? You know what to do . Now get me to the chopper and take me to Wild Palms . My sister 's waiting for me . - signs the campaign of Senator Kreutzer is crumbling as support grows for the fugitive Harry Wyckoff . Wyckoff released copies of his late wife 's diary to the media earlier today . Diaries which support growing allegations of murder , torture and New Realist mind control in the corridors of Mimecom . - Sporadic violence continues - - Yes , we 'll come . Right away . What is it ? Your brother underwent the procedure . He was supposed to wait for me . - I wanted to be there . - Something went wrong . It seems Harry got the chip to the boy , Peter . He tampered with it . Chickie taught him some tricks . I have to go to him . You blind fool . What do you think you 're doing ? Tully , please . What a strange world . So dramatic . So predatory . Don 't kill me . Not now . Just when everything was going so well . Tully we 're like two old generals . Yin and yang . Jewel and the lotus . I respect you . Please , Tully . Tell me what you want . Once , I was a painter . Mixing colors together was an ecstasy . I lived for light . Then one day a woman tore the eyes from my skull . I can give you things . With new technology , things you can 't imagine . Beyond seeing . Once , I was a painter . Then one day , my beloved Maisie was dead . Isn 't it strange ? Everything you could dream of right in your grasp . - It 's over . - No . Who would have thought ? Do it . I don 't like this , Harry . It 's too quiet . I don 't trust him . It 's all right . Kreutzer has gotta be weak . That 's if he 's alive at all . Harry ? Is that you ? Yes , senator , it 's me . I knew you were coming . That 's why I sent them all away . This is Mount Olympus now . Mortals will not be tolerated . - I 've made an exception for you . - There 's something wrong with him . Some hours ago I received the Go-chip implant . - How do you feel ? - They said it couldn 't be done . " Do not pass go , " they said . " Do not collect $ 200 . " I wanna talk to you . We never talked enough . That was my fault . Now we have all the time in the world . How well did you know my mother ? We enjoyed each other 's company . Bernice and I. Dex wasn 't too thrilled . We had a child together , did you know ? Dex thought it was his . Named the boy " Harry . " He found out . Dex did . He tried to kill me . I had to defend myself . Why didn 't you tell me instead of this insane charade ? Why ? The garden is filled with lies , Harry . Little lies . Thousands over a lifetime , like lilies of the field . My lies are Mimecom 's . State-of-the-art , for the masses . You took Peter my son , away from me . You took everything from me that I loved . Tell me why . Do you know what the unicorn does when it 's surrounded by hunters ? Tell me why , you psychotic son of a bitch . It somersaults into the nearest abyss , breaking the fall with its horn . You destroyed Coty . Your brother , Coty . It 's rather like an Arabian tale , isn 't it , Harry ? You made a monster out of that boy ! What 's happening ? Oh , my God . We altered the chip . Peter and I. My son . If there was time I would tell you all about your mother and me . I would tell you things only the wild palms know . Can 't feel my legs . Ain 't that the craziest thing ? Hello I must be going I cannot stay I came to say , I must be going Don 't you leave . Not yet ! I 'm glad I came , but just the same - I must be going - You ruined everything . You ruined everything that you touched . What 's the matter ? Wasn 't this world enough for you ? I 'll stay a week or two You didn 't have to run to paradise Father ! Paradise is here ! Here , damn it ! Here ! Paradise is right here ! I 'll stay the summer through But I am telling you I must be going Coward . I could have loved you . This is the way the world ends . Not with a bang but a whimper . Harry , look ! Did you speak to Father ? - In the living room . - Living room ? Funny , his body 's in the guesthouse . You know , I talked to him a while too . Then he floated over the roof like a Chagall . It 's over now . Easy for you to say . - Hello , Mother . - Coty , let us go . You 're very James Bond today , Mother . She was always in awe of Pussy Galore . Hey , stay away ! All this time ... - ... I find out we 're brothers . - Harry Wyckoff , this is your life . Look , our father is dead . I 'm taking Deirdre . Why don 't you come with us and leave all this behind . That 's what Daddy wanted . To leave everything behind . And look what happened . - It 's Little Boy Blue . - Peter , stay back ! I wanted to be here with you and Deirdre . That 's where I belong . How poignant . What are you gonna do , Coty ? Kill us all ? Deirdre 's watching . What do you think she sees ? You think she wants to stay with you ? Hey , she loves me . The great child guru of Synthiotics , a monster . How can she love a monster ? Hey , don 't you talk to me that way . Deirdre , come to Daddy . Leave her alone . If you love Deirdre so much let her make up her own mind . She wants to stay with me ! She loves me . I know she does . - Dierdre , come to me . - I 'll shoot . In front of your baby sister ? You 're gonna make a hell of a role model . I 'm sorry , baby . For letting them destroy you , I 'm so sorry . I 'll kill you dead , Mama . You wouldn 't hurt me . Give me the gun . Mother ... - ... who am I ? - Give me . Watch it ! Daddy ! Come here , baby . Come here . - Oh , are you all right ? - Yeah . It 's over . Let 's go . Poor men have grown to be rich men And rich men grown to be poor again For I am running to Paradise The wind is old and still at play While I must hurry upon my way And I am running to Paradise My Captain ! Our fearful trip is done The ship has weather 'd every rack The prize we sought is won O Captain ! My Captain ! Our fearful trip is done The ship has weather 'd every rack The prize we sought is won O Captain ! My Captain ! Our fearful ... Where will we go ? I 'm gonna take you to the tunnels at the beach , where Chickie lived . You 'll be safe there . I want you to be with the children . What will you do ? I 'll have to go back . They need me . Remember when you told me , Paige , about a thousand years ago that you wanted a world where you can keep your dreams open at night ? O Captain ! My Captain ! Rise up and hear the bells The Fathers have fallen ! The Fathers have fallen ! The Fathers have fallen ! She talked back there . Did you hear her ? You 're safe now . Daddy ? Yeah , baby ? What is it ? There 's so much I want to tell you . There 'll be lots of time , honey . Lots of time .

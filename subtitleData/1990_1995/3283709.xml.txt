 Today we start weight training . For the first two weeks we will do universal weights and after that aerobics . - Hey . Check out the amazons . - Oh . I 'd love to see the trail of broken thigh masters those legs left behind . Wyatt . Why don 't you come demonstrate the bench press ? Ouch . Direct hit . ( Grunting ) - ( Laughter ) - Catherine . Could you come help us a second ? Wyatt seems to be having a little trouble lifting . Could you show him a few presses ? Sure . Plant yourself solid on the bench feet on the floor . Push evenly with your arms . Careful not to left with your back . That 's pretty much it . Wyatt , this is all men . Where are the chicks ? - That is a chick . - Oh . Nice pecs . Look at this . I 'm pathetic . What girl would go out with a guy who looks like this ? Women today want more than just a good body . They want humor , compassion , and sensitivity . What a load . I wish women would tell the truth about this . I was lying . Today , more than ever women are looking for men with a sculpted , hard body . Enormous genitals don 't hurt either . TV : ... for a harder you a leaner you ... Lisa , I need your help . I want one of those exercise machines . That 's what I need : a body women drool over . - And I 'll work for it . - You got it . Well , Wyatt , here it is everything you need for a harder you a learner you , a brand-new you . Let 's do it . Come on , Wyatt . Go on . Dig in . You can do it . I 'm going to let go now . Would you leave my calendar alone ? It 's supposed to last a year , not a day . Sorry . Thought I 'd expand my vocabulary . All right , Wyatt , let 's check you out . So what do you think ? - I can 't lift my arms . - I can see a difference . - You look really buff . - Yeah ? - Truth ? - Pathetic . - Your chest seems even more sunken ... - Thank you ! That thing is a big waste of time . It 's going to take months to get pumped . Months ? Try years . I 'm not going back into that weight room without muscles . If you want a great body now , then that 's what you 'll get . You torched my clothes ! You wanted a great body , so I gave you a great body . Here . Try it on . One size fits all . ( Grunting ) - What do you think ? - It 's not what I had in mind . Well , you have to zip it up . ( Rumbling ) ( Groaning ) What 's happening to me ? ( Giggling ) Check it out . I am buff ! What are people going to say when they notice - I suddenly have muscles ? - Nothing . You see , you 've got a natural advantage working for you . You 're a nobody . When they see you with muscles they 'll be seeing you for the first time . Hi . Uh , remember me ? No . Um , I never lifted before and I was sort of hoping that you could spot me ? Sure . Whatever . I think you should unload that first . Is it supposed to be this easy ? That 's amazing . - Go . - ALL : Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . Oh , yeah . Thanks for spotting me . GIRL : Oww ! - Hi . - Hi . ( Wolf Whistle ) This is awesome . Every babe in the school wants your body . Some of this has to trickle down to me . Hey , wait up . You put on quite a show back there . Maybe we could train together some time . Uh , no thanks . I like to work out at home , alone . Okay . Guess I 'll see you around . - What ? - One of the slickest babes in school came up to you and said , " Hi . I think you 're pretty hot " and I want you to ask me out . " You replied in the unspoken language of love " I don 't date girls . " No way would she ever come on to me . You 're arms are bigger than my neck . You 're not you anymore . You 're Super Wyatt . You can get any girl- - including her . Do the deed . Ask her out . Hey ! Hi . Oh , hi . Look , uh ... Do you want to go out sometime ? - Huh ? - I said , do you want workout sometime ? Like you were asking , training together ? Sure . I just hope I can keep up . How about tomorrow ? Nice choke . Working out is still technically a man . Oh- - somebody discovered shoulder pads . Are you going to get your weenie-butts sacked in chess club ? - Hi , Chett . - Mom told me to wash the car , but wouldn 't you know it ? I 'm not in a car-washing mood . My guess is you are . Wash the car , wanker boy . This looks like a job for Super Wyatt . ( Bugle Playing " Charge " ) ( Karate Yells ) Holy monkeys ! I don 't like being talked to that way , Chett . Not now , not ever . He 's asking nicely ( Sniffing ) and how about a courtesy flush , huh ? You think that scares me ? That doesn 't scare me . I 've spent a lifetime putting my head through walls . Oh , ho , ho , ho . You 're dead . I don 't know what you 're amped up on , cud-boy . - But I can sit down . - Oh , really ? - Give it your best shot . - Famous last words . ( Crunching ) Chett , is there any chance you 're in a car-washing mood now ? I 'll do it this once ... ( Whimpers ) but not because you want me to ... but because the car is dirty and if there 's one thing I can 't stand it 's a dirty car . That suit is awesome . You got to let me borrow it . ( Imitating Schwarzenegger : ) Like a heat-seeking muscle missile I will seek out and terminate my enemies . Good Afternoon . I 'm the one who sent the invitations . You are all the jerks that have made my short life a living hell . Does this mean we 're not going to get the free VCRs ? You- - Bonomo- - you shoved me off my bike . In the fourth grade . My skin 's never been the same . You- - Jergens- - you put a " kick me " sign on my back in the sixth grade . I still cramp up on cold days . You- - Wendy- - You got the wrong invitation . I 'm having this group oil-rub thing next saturday . - I hope you can make it . - Okay . So , you still don 't remember me . I 'm Gary Wallace but you all probably know me as ... Mr. Wussy ? Mop top ? Oh , yeah . Pipe cleaner boy ? I remember pipe cleaner boy . You said I would never get a date . Well , you were wrong . - I 'd like you to my meet girlfriend . - Hi , everyone . I 'm Lisa , I 'm Gary 's girlfriend , and I 'm 100 % sexually satisfied . Gary has found ways to arouse and fulfill me that no other man could ever duplicate . Get the picture ? You see , the tables have turned . I 'm the winner and you 're the losers . Any non-believers can step forward and I 'll prove my point . Spare me the freak show . I don 't have time for this . You 're not going to insult us by leaving , are you ? It 's either that or I pound your face in- - scuzz bucket . Ah , " scuzz bucket- - " that old chestnut . So you do remember me . Now you 're going to see what it feels like to be the wussy . What 's all the hubbub ... I don 't have any rough-housing . If you find it necessary to settle your differences like animals take it to the zoo- - Well , not literally , of course . They don 't allow fighting either . This isn 't over . I 'm still going to hurt you . I look forward to it . - Uh , excuse me , miss , uh ... ? - Miss Graham . - I 'm subbing today in civics . - Yes , of course . Miss Graham . Well , although there is no written dress code you might be making it difficult for the boys to , uh ... focus on their studies . I consider that a double standard especially coming from you . I 'm afraid I don 't understand . Superintendent ! What a pleasant surprise . ( Imitating Schwarzenegger : ) I will crush your head with my fingers , Ted . That is how very strong I am . - WYATT : Hey , Gary ? - In here . Oh , good . Did you bring the suit back ? - Yeah , but it 's my day for it . - No . No . - I have my date with Catherine . - A day-date ? - Who has a day-date ? - We 're going hiking . You 'll have to reschedule the pummeling . So , where 's the suit ? It 's finishing up in the dry cycle . I thought I 'd wash it . It was getting pretty stinky . What ? I used fabric softener . ( Screams ) It 's completely ruined . Didn 't you read the tag ? It 's a magic suit of living muscles . It doesn 't come with washing instructions . Of course , it does . " Dry clean only . Do not machine wash . " - Son of a gun . - Hey , guys . How 's the ... Shredded muscle suit ? - The bonehead washed it . - Didn 't you read the tag ? Look , we could spend all day talking about who didn 't read what tag or get on with our lives . Ted 's going to kill Gary . And Catherine won 't go out with me looking like this . Well , Gary can talk to Ted reason with him . And as far as Catherine goes try it without the muscles . Show her the real you . Girls really respond to honesty . Truth . Catherine 's going to blow you off so you 're going to have to fake it . It 's your only chance . And Ted 's going to cream you big-time . Hold still . Your pecs are a little uneven . This stuff is so itchy . There . Finished . Okay , Lis . I did the hard past . Now all I 'm asking for is a little magic just to get it all back together . Please ? That 's all the help you 'll get from me . And by the way you need a nipple there , not a kneecap . - Ooh . Catch . - Okay , guys . What do you think ? The truth . - Very hot . - Great . He 's going to be very hot wearing that . I haven 't forgotten our little car-washing incident . You caught me off guard . But this time ... I 'll spare you your tongue so you can dial 911 . - ( Shrieking ) - Go ahead , Chett . Nunchaku away . You 'll probably beat me to a pulp just like you did last time . Oh. oh , that 's right . I kicked your butt last time . - Remember ? - Rah ! Mess with me again and I will inflict such mind-numbing pain you will regret the day that I was ever born . Spine ... searing ... pain . ( Screams ) Let 's get one thing straight . I 'm not leaving because I 'm scared . Leaving because I 'm scared of what I might do to you 'cause you were born a wussy you are a wussy and you will always be a wussy ! And ... just wait till I tell Dad you punched a hole in the bathroom wall . How you doing back there ? I 'm so hot ! Why did you get all dressed up like you 're doing to church ? When you said " hike " I thought you meant , you know ... downhill . Why don 't we rest or even turn back ? I got a great hiking simulator on my computer . - I 'm not into computers . - We could eat . We passed a burger hut . I don 't eat junk food . No computers ? No junk food ? I 'm guessing you 've never been to a Star Trek convention ? GARY : Lisa ? You think this thing will hold together ? Maybe I should have double-stitched . It will be fine . Zip it up . - ( Zipping ) - ( Screaming ) Gary ? Gary , you okay ? Yeah . I just caught myself in the zipper . We made it ! Don 't you feel great ? ( Panting ) A swimming hole ! - Can we drink it ? - Drink it ? I 've got a better idea . Let 's go swimming . You mean ... get undressed ? I don 't have my bathing suit . - Me neither . - ( Whimpers ) I can 't do this becasue I can 't ... take off my clothes in front of you . - Why not ? - Uh ... - I think we have to break up . - What ? - This is our first date . - I don 't think it 's going to work out . We 're very different people . And we definitely shouldn 't be naked together . When did you come up with this ? Somewhere around 7,000 feet . We were having fun . We were , but ... you got to understand . Um , I 've been down this road before : girls who only want to go out with me because I have this great body always coming up with excuses for me to take my shirt off . Wyatt , I don 't care about your body . I mean , it 's nice , but I 've seen better . Really ? So you don 't care if I have muscles or not ? Give me a little credit . It 's the complete person that counts . It 's not as if you like me just because I 'm pretty . - No . Of course not . - Then let 's go swimming . Great . Because I am sweating like a pig in here . See , I thought you only liked buff guys so I stuffed my clothes . Pretty crazy , huh ? I am so relieved ! I can finally show you the real me ! For the first in my life I 'm not embarrassed about my body . Come on ! Let 's get wet ! All right , Ted , you no-neck little weenus . I 'm ready for you . And I 'm ready for you ... scuzz bucket . Don 't call me that . ( Grunting ) ( Electricity Crackling ) - ( Screams ) - That 's right . Run away , you little punk . And if you ever mess with me again you 'll be crawling home . Be a problem . I had a great time at the falls this weekend . - Yeah , me too . - I 'm glad we got past that perfect body stuff . I can 't tell you how comfortable I feel knowing that I can be myself . Uh-huh . Gary , you know Catherine , my , um ... girlfriend ? - Hi . - Hi . So ... you want to go back to the falls this weekend ? Uh , I don 't know . This weekend ? I 'll call you . I will . Did you hear that ? We 're going out again this weekend . Does she dig me or what ? What can I say ? She digs you . - Truth . - Wyatt , I hate to tell you this but ... - Lie . Catherine will love you till the end of time . That 's all I wanted to hear . Captioned by Grantman Brown

Take whatever else you want ... anything ... but put that back . Valuable , huh ? Not valuable , you idiot . Dangerous , it 's cursed . - What are you talking about ? - Bad luck . Anybody who comes near you , terrible things will happen . The suffering-the suffering that has caused down through history . It 's evil . Yeah ? Then what are you doin ' with it ? I didn 't know at first . Then my wife .. I have every intention of destroying it . Yeah , I might not be the smartest guy on two feet but I ain 't totally stupid . [ thunder rumbling ] [ intense music ] [ thunder rumbling ] [ music continues ] [ engine revving ] [ tires screeching ] ( Clark ) Well , that was kinda fun . Oh , please . A man 's bitten by a radioactive frog gets magical leaping ' powers and then puts on a green costume and fights crime , it was ridiculous . Alright , well , the green costume was a bit much but .. [ tires screeching ] That idiot is gonna kill somebody . [ tires screeching ] - We better call the police . - It 's a .. Clark . I should be used to this by now . [ dramatic music ] What 's your problem ? I thought you only went after guys like Metallo and Luthor . Okay , okay . I surrender , alright ? Surrender ? You better get out of the car . [ thunder rumbling ] [ sparks crackling ] Oh , ah . [ zapping ] [ screaming ] [ dramatic music ] [ tires screeching ] Lana , are you alright ? I-I think so . [ lightning crackling ] Superboy ? I-I thought lightning wasn 't supposed to strike the same place twice . [ intense music ] [ gasping ] Phew ! I mean , he had me . If it wasn 't for that lightning , I woulda .. [ dramatic music ] [ thunder rumbling ] Terrible things to anyone who comes ... near me . [ evil laughter ] [ phone ringing ] - Leak 's back . - I thought they fixed that . They did . Three times . [ phone ringing ] Ever get the feeling the gods are laughing at you ? It 's just a little water . Now this , this is a disaster . I was walking to work this morning and just as I stepped off the kerb this truck zips by through this puddle of water and splashes . Just a little water . [ phone rings ] Hey , could be worse . You could be Superboy . What 's that supposed to mean ? Shows up at this three alarm fire goes to put it out with his Super Breath and ... blows the roof off the house , instead . How is he supposed to know they 're in the middle of putting a new roof on ? He put out the fire , didn 't he ? And that kinda thing 's been happening to him for weeks now . If I believed in bad luck streaks .. Well , there 's only one kinda luck in this life the kind we make ourselves . ( Clark ) Well , you really have to wonder sometimes . I mean , look at this guy .. ... the thief they 're calling , Mr. Lucky . He strolls into a bank just as the alarm system fails and the security guard gets an attack of appendicitis . Walks off with $ 10,000 . Well , things happen . You can 't assign cosmic significance to everything , can you ? [ Matt chuckling ] [ whistling ] [ burglar alarm ringing ] - Well , go after him ! - Me ? That 's what we pay for , isn 't it ? - What 's the trouble ? - We 've been robbed . He just walks in like he owns the place empties our registers and then strolls out again . And he was no help at all . M-my gun jammed a-and the sprinklers went off there was water everywhere . I couldn 't see- - He was driving , he was driving a white four door sedan . A Falcon , I think . Must be 1962 , ' 63 . [ thunder rumbling ] [ whooshing ] Close your mouth . [ upbeat music ] ( female # 1 ) Oh-h ! I 'm so sorry . I was chasing someone in a car that .. ... it looked exactly like this one . You know , we saw that car . It was parked right near ours . We almost got in it ourselves . Astonishing , isn 't it ? That two cars like this , would be on the road at the same time . I 'm really sorry . You 're forgiven . Thank you , sister . [ lightning crackling ] - Yeah ! - See that ? I 'm fine . Just fine . [ thunder rumbling ] ( male # 1 ) I 'm telling ya . I have got the power , right here in my hand . Superboy gets in my way , anyone gets in my way .. ... they 're history . A threat , Mr. Carmichael ? [ ominous music ] What if it is ? Guys like you have been threatening me my whole life . Well , no more . You say you have the power to ... stop Superboy ? Stop him ? Ha ! I cursed him . Don 't you read the papers ? He 's on the way down . And me ... I 'm on the way to the top . And if we throw in with you , we 'll have the advantage of this eh ... protection ? Hey , I want the best working ' for me . You arrogant little worm . You 're lucky , Mr. Bennett 's breathing the same air as you . ( Bennett ) Andrew , please . Bit of a hot head , huh ? [ water gushing ] So , what do you say , Mr. B ? I have three things to say , Mr. Carmichael . One ... if your story is true and your phenomenal rise these past weeks certainly allows at least the possibility , that it is , then it would be to my advantage to give you a chance to prove yourself . - Prove ? - I am not finished . Two , I 've known men like you , before . They have a lucky streak , they think they own the whole world . Then they find out that luck alone is just not enough when they fall . - Hey , now just a minute . - I 'm not finished . Three ... if that curse you put on Superboy was real then there exists the equally real possibility that there is a way to counteract it . Hey , this is , this is Charlie Carmichael you talkin ' to , and I got all that counteract stuff covered . Let 's hope so .. ... because then we just might be able to do business . [ chuckling ] [ intense music ] [ laughing ] What are you doing ? ( male # 1 ) Watch it ! I 'm paintin ' . ( Clark ) Just window shopping . - Good luck crystals ? - For Superboy . [ laughing ] As if he needs your help . [ female screaming ] [ dramatic music ] Lana , I think I left my wallet in the car . [ music continues ] ( male # 1 ) Oops , I told you to look out . [ tires screeching ] [ crashing ] Are you outta your mind ? That 's what I was gonna ask you . You idiot , we 're makin ' a movie . ( male # 1 ) Everybody , back to one . We 'll do it again . The dumpster , it 's rigged to blow . [ intense music ] [ intense music ] Mr. Corrigan ? Hello ? Mr. Corrigan ? Hi , I 'm Lana Lang from the Bureau Of Extra-Normal Matters . You called about a coin that had a curse on it . Yes . Something 's come up . I can 't talk now . It will only take a few minutes . I am afraid not . Can you tell me anything about it ? Er , well , legend says that-that whoever possesses the coin can bring catastrophic bad luck to his enemies and consequently , good luck to himself . Well , it 's been nice talking to you , Miss . Lang . I think she 's some kinda cop . Relax , he 's getting rid of her . I 'm not gonna relax until I get that counteracting thing outta him . When you called the Bureau , you sounded very anxious to talk to someone . Bureau , I knew it . She 's FBI . Hold it , right there ! ( Lana ) What is this ? Carmichael , we don 't have time for this now . We got a job to do . Come on , come on , come on . I 've got friends waiting , they 'll know something 's wrong . Doesn 't matter , as long as I have this . [ dramatic music ] [ phone rings ] Lana ? No , he 's gone for the day . Right . [ alarm ringing ] [ exploding ] [ intense music ] Nice job . [ music continues ] [ chuckling ] Look at this thing ! The Shining Buddha , worth a 100 million easy . Alright , come on , Carmichael . We 've got it , now let 's move . Hey , what 's your hurry , huh ? You working with Mr. Lucky here . Nothing 's gonna go wrong . You tripped the silent alarm . I have very good hearing . - I remember you . - So you do ? I 'm the guy that put the whammy on ya . Me and my cursed coin . I don 't believe in curses . I think you better . [ thrilling music ] ( Carmichael ) Good idea . Think of all the damage if a skyscraper like this , collapsed . Hey , we 're in a hurry , remember ? Good work . Keep it up . [ building crumbling ] Alright , no one move ! Just remain calm . Oh , it 's you , again . Call the police . Is this a coincidence or what ? I got fired from that job at the store after that mess with the robbery and everything . Call the police ! I didn 't mind that much . I got to meet you and everything . [ impatiently ] Go ! Stay right there . I will . Kind of old , huh ? Well , let 's see if it still works . [ machine whirring ] [ dramatic music ] Now , tell me about that counteractor thing . I-I don 't know how to counteract it . I swear . Well , then I guess the secret dies with you . Hey , wait . Look , there 's lots of ways to handle this . You 're telling me Bennett never takes out his enemies ? Only if there 's no other choice . Well , I 'm not Bennett . I 'm Charlie Carmichael . And I 'll kill whoever I want , whenever I want . Now , back off before something bad happens to you . You 're on your own . Fine . Fine . That 's just the way I like it . [ intense music ] - Where did they go ? - Where did who go ? Look , I 'm not really in a very good mood tonight . Warehouse , 26th street , 1954 East 26th street . I wanna see how you botch this one . Good luck . ( Carmichael ) Nice and slow this time . It 'll give you plenty of time to think about that counteracting thing . [ machine whirring ] Lana ! Superboy . What 's wrong ? Here , you drive . I 'll tell you what 's wrong . He knows he 's cursed . This thing is about to fall apart , as it is . You go blundering in it 's all gonna come crashing down on them . Superboy ! - What if he 's right ? - You know I 'm right . Remember , you 're cursed . ( Lana ) No , you 're not . On the way over , Mr. Gorgon told me about the incantation . I know how to stop the curse . [ reciting incantation ] Shut up ! [ reciting incantation ] - No , it 's too late ! - No , you can do it . [ reciting incantation ] [ metallic creaking ] [ dramatic music ] It 's all her fault . If it wasn 't for that incananatation . ( Lana ) What incantation ? Oh , few words I remembered from high school Latin . It worked , didn 't it ? I got you to believe in yourself again . It certainly did . And she 's crazy . I 'm Charlie Carmichael . And I cursed you once and I 'll curse you again . Oh , where is it ? Hey , the coin ! It 's the only reason you nailed me . Just wait . I 'll get it back . And when I do .. Hm . Must be my lucky day . [ theme music ] [ music continues ] [ music continues ] [ music ends ]

 ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) Ooh ... Ooh ... Ah . Aah ... Who the hell are you ? ( WHISTLES CHEERFULLY ) ( CRUNCHING ) Welcome back on-line , sir . - How are you ? - Not good . I don 't know who I am . - Where is this place ? - You have amnesia . That 's common after prolonged periods in deep sleep . - You have been out for over 200 years . - 200 years ? ! I tried to wake you in the spring , but you insisted on another three months . I 've just been preparing your breakfast tray . These cornflakes have got grated raw onions sprinkled on them . That 's how you like them , sir . Ugh ! ( SPITS ) The orange juice is revolting ! That 's your early morning pick-me-up , chilled vindaloo sauce . I drink cold curry sauce for breakfast ? It depends . If you get up in the afternoon , you prefer a can of last night 's flat lager . That 's why you keep a tea strainer by your bed - to sieve out cigar dimps . I drink , smoke and have cold curry sauce for breakfast ? I sound like some barely human grossed-out slime-ball . Oh , it 's all flooding back , is it , sir ? No . None of it is . Perhaps these will help . Your personal artefacts . Kristine Kochanski . You dated her once before she discarded you for a catering officer . - She 's beautiful . - It 's your ambition , sir , some day , to win her back , then lie on her and move up and down rapidly in that curious way that humans find so agreeable . Personally , I prefer partnership whist . What ? I play guitar ? Do I have a head like an amusing ice cube ? Chuck out some power chords . See if anything comes back . ( OFF-KEY , AIMLESS STRUMMING ) Yeah ! The axe man is back ! Don 't patronise me . I can 't play . Anyone with half an ear can tell that . When your personality is restored , you will firmly believe you can play guitar like the ghost of Hendrix . Is there something good you can tell me about myself ? Something ... laudable ? Laudable ... You sometimes help me with my laundry duties by turning your underpants inside out and extending the wear time by three weeks . I 'm an animal . I 'm a tasteless , uncouth , mindless , tone-deaf , randy , blokeish , semi-literate space bum . Oh ! Welcome back , Mr Lister , sir ! - What 's that ? - Mr Rimmer , sir . This is his light bee . ( RATTLES ) - He 's a hologram . - Rimmer ? - He 's my best mate , isn 't he ? - Sir , you are sick ! Maybe a synaptic enhancer will do the trick . Initiating boot-up sequence . Downloading physical form . Access personality banks . Load arrogance . Load charisma . Load neuroses . Download memory . Oh , THAT Rimmer . Nice cornflakes . Nice and oniony . Pass the Tabasco sauce . Needs a bit more pep . Congratulations . You 're on the way to full recall . - You 'll soon think you can play guitar . - I CAN play the guitar ! I 'm a diva ! I make that lump of wood sing like a Yukon bear trapper on his annual visit to the brothel . Maybe , but the deal stays the same . I know . If I want to play guitar , I have do it in outer space . - Peasants . - I suggest we start debriefing . - Mr Rimmer ? - Thank you , Kryten . Now , gentlemen , as we know , we have lost Red Dwarf . This is not the time for petty recrimination . The time for that is when Lister is court-martialled . - I didn 't lose it . - You 're the one who parked it and can 't remember where you left it . They 're all the same , those little blue-green planetoids - blue-green and planetoidy . Sirs , there 's no advantage in finger-pointing . We didn 't lose Red Dwarf . It was stolen by persons or life-forms unknown . Who 'd steal a gigantic trash can with no brakes and three million years on the clock ? Rogue droids , genetically engineered life-forms , figments of Mr Lister 's imagination made solid by some weird space ray . Who knows ? The important thing is that after 200 years following the trail , we have them . - What do you mean ? - They had to make a detour to circumnavigate this asteroid belt . However , Starbug is small enough to go through the middle . For the first time for two centuries , we can head them off at the pass and recover Holly . You 're forgetting about Space Corps Directive 1742 . 1742 ? " No member of the Corps should ever report for duty in a ginger toupee " . Thank you for reminding me of that , sir , but how is it pertinent to our present situation ? - 1743 , then . - Oh , I see . " No vessel should transverse an asteroid belt without deflectors . " - Yes ! God , he 's pedantic . - Rimmer , check out the supply situation . Your hologram 's on battery back-up . Oxygen for three months . Water , if we drink recyc , seven weeks . Worst of all , we 're down to our last 2,000 poppadoms . We 're in trouble . You know how unstable those belts are . Rogue asteroids , meteor storms ... One direct hit on that view-screen , and our innards will turn inside out quicker than Lister 's underpants . We 're out of options . We 're going in . Recommend the Cat pilots . His superior nasal intuition will give us our best chance . For pity 's sake ! One breach and we 're people pâté . There 's a Cat proverb - it 's better to live an hour as a tiger than a lifetime as a worm . There 's an old human proverb - whoever heard of a wormskin rug ? Yeah , nice stickwork , man . - Something 's coming . - Nothing on the navicomp . I can smell it . Something big . - I 'm getting nothing , either . - These nostrils never lie . He 's right . Co-ordinates 5341 by 6163 . Take a peek . There 's a meteor bigger than King Kong 's first dump of the day ... and it 's steaming straight towards us . - ( KRYTEN ) Too vast to go around . - Reverse thrust ! There 's no time . Face it , we 're deader than corduroy . - Kryten , you know what to do . - On my way , sir . - What 's he doing ? - He 's customised the waste disposal unit , turned it into a high-impact garbage cannon . You 're going to shoot it with tins and banana peel ? ! There 's a surprise in there - a thermos of nitroglycerine . - Waste disposal unit armed and ready . - Kryten , will this work ? Lie mode . Of course it 'll work , sir . No worries . Hook , line , sinker , rod and copy of " Angling Times " , sir . - Here it comes ! - Ready , Kryten ? Fire ! ( LISTER ) Yes ! Relocating Red Dwarf 's trail . At present speed and course , estimated time to interception , 12 hours , 7 minutes . I 'm getting something new , and it does not smell good . There . Got it . Looks like some kind of ship . Wait , there 's another ... and another . - I 'm getting them too . Ten ... no , twelve . - All derelicts . It 's like a giant spaceship graveyard . Who else feels that we 've been led here like lambs to a kebab shop ? We don 't move till we know what happened here . Recommend we stop and launch scouter . Engines stopped . Scouter launched . ( RIMMER ) We 're in . - What 's that ? - Human remains . Wait . Angle up five degrees . Across ten degrees . There . Some kind of writing on the floor . P-S-l-R-E-N-S . Psirens . The poor devil scrawled it in his death throes , using a combination of his own blood and even his own intestines . - Who would do that ? - Someone who badly needed a pen . Why go to the trouble of using his kidney as a full stop ? I don 't think he meant that . It probably just plopped out . Whoever he was , he was desperate to warn any wretches who wandered into the same trap . Scouter 's located the black box . OK . Replay final entry . They 're closing in . They 're all over the ship . I know I 'm next . It 's just a matter of time before ... Oh , God ! You 're beautifull I can 't resist you . Have to be strong . I know what you want ! No , you don 't want to love me . You want to suck out my brains with that straw . Get away from me ! What have you done , you evil harlot ! You 've squeezed the ketchup out of my burger ! Now what ? No ! Get that straw out of my ear ! ( SQUELCHINGAND GROANING ) OK . Scouters checked out black boxes on three of the derelicts . This belt is swarming with some kind of genetically engineered life-form who can alter your perception telepathically . They 're called Psirens , like with Ulysses in the Turkish legend . - The legend was Greek , sir . - Whatever . Some country big on curly shoes and hoummos . They use this power of illusion to lure you onto the asteroids . Then they take whatever they can use ... and suck out your brains . They shouldn 't bother us . There 's barely a snack on-board . We can 't turn back . We 'll lose Red Dwarf . We 'll be through the belt in four hours . Just stay on the case . They 'll try to tempt us , scare us - anything to force us onto the rocks . Incoming message . It 's pretty weak . Please help us . Our settlement is almost extinct . - There are only women left . - Barely 3,000 of us . If we are to survive , we need males to spread their seed amongst our number . - We beg you ... make love to us . - Make love to all of us . You heard ' em , they want seed-spreaders . I 'm going to apply . You guys deal with this Psiren thing . I 'll deal with this . Call me paranoid , but you don 't think they were Psirens ? Even the brunette ? If you want me , I 'll be taking a cold shower in liquid oxygen . If that 's the most sophisticated enticement they can throw at us , we 're hardly in danger . If I may postulate , that was merely the level of sophistication required to lure the Cat . Had we not stopped him , he would be on an asteroid , with no brain , trying to write " Oh , boy , was I suckered ? " with his own intestinal tract . Incoming message . Here they go again . This Captain Tau of the SCS Pioneer . We 're under attack . Some form of scavengers ... Psirens . They lured us onto this asteroid , killed most of the crew . ( WAILS ) Is this genuine ? Don 't try to help us . We 're finished . Save yourselves . - Kochanski ! - Dave ? Is that you ? - I thought you were dead . - No time to explain . - Get out of the belt while you can ! - It 's Kochanski . We 'll be OK . They 'll never take us alive . I 'm keeping three bullets , for me and the two kids . - Kids ? ! - Your two sons , Dave . How ... ? l-l don 't understand . When you went into stasis , I broke into the sperm bank on Red Dwarf . You 're a father . Here they come ! Jim , Bexley , come to Mummy . Wait ! I 'm coming ! Kryten , bazookoids . Rimmer , plot a course . Tune into Sanity FM ! - You saying they were Psirens ? - It 's as plain as a Bulgarian pin-up . - More trouble heading straight for us . - What ? What do you call giant meteorites covered in flames ? - Giant flaming meteorites . - That 's it . Should I load the garbage cannon ? - It wouldn 't make a dent . - Course change . - Engaging re-heat . - There 's nothing on the radar . - So ? - I think it 's another illusion . - Psirens ? - Cat ? Are you getting any scent from it ? They got a duty-free shop ? - Can you smell anything ? - No . Suggest we maintain present course . That fireball does not exist . - Say you 're wrong ? - I 'll stake my reputation . - You haven 't got a reputation . - I will after this escapade . It 's closing . Too late to run . Relax , gentlemen . You 're quite safe . Ah . Smug mode . Well ... I can 't hang around here saving your necks all day . I guess I 'll make a start on that ironing . I 'm getting another one . Better get Kryten . He 'll know what to do . I 'm perfectly capable of dealing with a giant flaming meteorite , thank you very much . We do not need help from a droid with a head like a genetically flawed lumpfish . OK , keep your " H " on . So what do we do ? There 's nothing on the radar . We do nothing . Guys , what 's happening ? Cabin temperature 's rising . Psirens again . Another illusion . It 's in hand . What if the fireball 's real and the radar read-out 's the illusion ? Gentlemen , relax . We 're quite safe . - Any damage ? - Not too bad . Two sensors are out , fuel-intake chambers are flooded and the seat doesn 't go up and down any more . - We 're intact ? ! - Starbug was built to last , sir . This baby 's crashed more times than a ZX81 . It 's what it 's made of . Aerospace engineers discovered that , after a plane crash , the one thing that survives is a cute doll , so they built this with the same stuff . - Is that a fact ? - You 're so gullible . Thanks ! - How long before we can take off ? - Just ... Oh , wait . The front landing stanchion is embedded in rock . We have to blast it free . - I 'll go . - Sir , the atmosphere is thin , and this place is crawling with Psirens . You look after the engine . I 'll go and be brave . Two minutes maximum . - How 's that ? - ( CA T ) Looking good . We 'll clear the rest on take-off . - On me way back . - Hi , Dave . - Smeggin ' hell . Pete Tranter 's sister ? - Remember me , Dave ? You lusted after me all through your puberty . And now , at last , I can be yours . Stay back . I know what you want . It 's in my head . That 's where it 's staying . You know what you want . You want to squeeze my buttocks together to make one juicy giant peach . I get it . You want me to drown in my own drool . - Don 't fight it . - Stay back , Pete Tranter 's sister . How long has it been since you made love to a woman ? I admit it 's been a while . - It 's been three million years . - I count it in ice ages . Then it 's only four . In leap ice ages , hardly even one . That 's a long time , Dave , for a man of your drives . It 's a long time for an Albanian shepherd who 's allergic to wool . - Kiss me . - I can 't resist you any more . Your death will be exquisite . I 'll take you to the peak of ecstasy , then I 'll blow your mind . Come on , Dave . Let 's get out of here . " Dave " ? - ( KRYTEN ) Sir ? Is everything OK ? - What 's the delay ? ( LISTER ) Two Psirens killed each other fighting over my brains . Oh , smeg . It 's the TV weathergirl from Channel 27 . - Fight it . Don 't look . - It 's not that easy . You can 't see what she 's doing . - I 'm starting up the engines . - Get back in here now ! On me way . It 's me . It 's getting hairy out there . Let 's vamoose . Why the hell are you taking off ? ! Let me in ! - Sir , you 're already here . - He 's a Psiren . Don 't let him in . For God 's sake ! He 's the Psiren ! Let me in ! - What do we do ? - We 've got to let him in . Then we 'll definitely have a Psiren on-board , a psychotic temporal lobe slurper . There 's a 50 % chance we already have . We can 't risk killing Mr Lister . How many times ? He 's the Psiren . I 'm me . How can you believe this ? ! He doesn 't even look like me . He 's podgy . He hasn 't got my profile . - You 're both identical . - ( BOTH ) No way ! I 'm going to try some tests . Both right-handed . Correct . Kryten ? Now , gentlemen . Trim your toenails . Enough ! - Play the guitar . - What ? - Here ? Inside ? - Play it . ( PLAYS ROCK SOLO SKILFULLY ) - How did you know ? - That dude could play . - He was no better than me . - That 's how you believe you play . The Psiren read your mind , sharing your delusion that you are NOT a tone-deaf , talentless noise-polluter . You 're seriously saying you think he was better than me ? ( TUNELESS RACKET ) - What 's the difference ? - Little survival tip , bud . Never play in front of a man with a gun . I resent this . I resent you saving my life in this way . Er ... Where 's it gone ? - It 's crawled down to the engine room . - ( ALARM SOUNDS ) Meteor storm off the starboard bow ! Suggest Mr Rimmer and I pursue the Psiren . Er ... That 's QUITE a good plan . Excellent but for one detail . I think you know what it is . Bye ! ( BEEPING ) ( RAPID BEEPING ) Please , there 's no logic in trying to engage me in combat . I am unseduceable in that I have no desires , and my brain is synthetic and of no use to you . Give yourself up . Professor Mamet ? My creator . - Hello , Kryten . - What is the function of this illusion ? You cannot harm me . It 's coded into you . You 're totally defenceless against me . True . However , the others are not so hampered . You 're also programmed to obey my commands . Drop the radio . - Open the waste compactor . - What are you doing ? ! - Climb inside . - No ! No ! ( GRUNTS ) - This serves no ... - Engage the mechanism . You are sick ! Die . ( LISTER ) Kryten ? You there ? The meteor storm was an illusion . The Psiren 's not as badly injured as we thought . ( RIMMER ) Kryten ? - ( WHISPERS ) It 's got him . - Kryten ! My battery 's going . Only seconds left . I need a recharge ... And then there were two . - Want a drink ? - Buddy , I 'm parched . Wait a minute . What 's a vending machine doing in the engine room ? I 'm almost annoyed . - We 're clear of the belt . - What about Red Dwarf ? It 's gone into that gas nebula . Then that 's where we 're heading . - Tea ? - Cheers , man . Don 't put it on the console , sir . It leaves ugly rings . Use me as a table . - I thought you were fixing yourself . - Not before I 've finished my duties , sir . I can 't go engaging my self-repair unit , not with a pile of laundry like the north face of the Eiger . Besides , Cat has invited me to the crap game tonight . He 's gonna be the dice . - Approaching nebula . - ( LISTER ) Well , let 's see what 's in there . # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mangojuice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

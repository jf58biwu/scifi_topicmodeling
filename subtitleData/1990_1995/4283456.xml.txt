 ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) ( MUSIC : SULTRY JAZZ ) Maybe it 's the moonlight , but you look pretty good for a corpse . - I can explain everything . - Let me save you the trouble . You planned Pallister 's murder , but your sister squibbed him off . You took the rap , knowing you had an alibi in me . You played me for the dumb sap I am . - It wasn 't like that , not with you . - Yeah ? So you going to turn me in ? Watch me do the sit-down dance in the electric chair ? No , sweet-lips . I 'm gonna let you kiss me . Sir , you should come and take a look at this . Sir , it really is quiet urgent . I want you , Loretta , your body next to mine , like you were that Tuesday night . Kiss me ! Honestly ! Honestly , you haven 't been off this machine in a month . Oh ! Philip , I don 't understand . It 's simple , Loretta . This isn 't real . It 's an AR computer simulation game . I hand you to the cops and get the goody-goody heroine . I 've played it before . It 's just that you drive me wild . - You 're the sexiest computer sprite ever . - Oh , Philip . - I don 't care that you 've killed three men . - Five . Whatever . It 's not your fault . You 're programmed . So you take me for what I am ? A psychopathic , schizophrenic , serial-killing femme fatale ? Forgive and forget , I say . Pucker up . " Choose your character . " Oh , honestly ! I just want to talk to him . Oh , anything ... Sammy the Squib . Crack shot with tommy-gun . Engage . Oh , it 's so frivolous ! Mr Lister , sir ? Hmm , curious . Hi , Kryten . What are you doing here ? I finished the chemical scan and discovered traces of millennium oxide in the vicinity . Couldn 't be happier . See you . Sir , I believe we 've wandered accidentally into a rogue simulant hunting zone . That would explain the devastation on the derelicts where we found this game . Who is it ? It 's Sammy the Squib ! - Good evening , miss . - Don 't kill me , Sammy . Kill him . I 'll come away with you . I never stopped loving you . Kiss me . - You 're trash , aren 't you ? - I 'm programmed to be trash . I can 't resist her , Kryten . Get back in the car . I only ever fall for heartbreakers or moral garbage on legs . Sir , turn off the AR console . We have to continue on silent running to avoid detection . - Ten minutes . - Sir . - I 'll keep my hat on ! - Now ! Philip ? I 'll be back , sweet-lips . Stay bad . Kryten , you are a total gooseberry ! Next time I play , I 'll give you money to go to the pictures . At last , we have silent running . OK , long-range scanners are down . The only early warning we 've got is you . OK , bud . I 'll keep my nose peeled . You took your time . Where 've you been ? - In the AR machine . - Again ? - What do you mean , " again " ? - You only use the AR machine to have sex . - That is not true ! - Yes , true . It 's pathetic watching you grind away ... day after day . You 're like a dog that 's missing its master 's leg . That groinal attachment 's supposed to have a lifetime 's guarantee . - You 've worn it out in nearly three weeks . - That is an outrageous piece of libel . I don 't just play the role-play games . What about zero-G kickboxing and Wimbledon ? You 're having it off with that jailbait ballgirl . Another total lie ! She 's not jailbait , she 's 17 . Lister , she 's a computer sprite . She 's just a load of pixels . Yeah , but what pixels . - What 's all the hullabaloo ? - We 've wandered into rogue simulant country . Biomechanical killers created for a war that never took place . Some escaped the dismantling programme and prowl space searching for quarry worthy of their mettle . I say abandon pursuit of Red Dwarf and flee . Give up the chase ? You 're kidding ? - Wait . My nose is getting something . - Powering up . - Scanners report a battle-class cruiser . - It 's rogue simulants , all right . Recommend immediate total surrender . Sir , surrender is the worst thing to do . They despise all humanoid life . They think you 're the vermin of the universe . I didn 't even know they 'd met him . Getting a message . Punching it up . State your species and purpose . One of us will have to speak to them . Who 's the least human-looking ? Listy , the mic 's all yours . Wait . I 've got an idea . Stall them with static . Kryten , mid-section . Cat , you too . Why do you delay ? State your species and purpose . You have one minute . - What the hell are you doing ? - ( LISTER ) Nearly ready to transmit . - Incoming . - ( LISTER ) I am Tarka Dall , an ambassador of the great Vindaloovian Empire . Scanners reported human life on your vessel . Is this so ? Humans ? ! ( SPITS ) The Vindaloovian people despise all humans . They are the vermin of the Universe . Is that not right , Bhindi Bhaji ? ( CAT ) You bet . We hate them . Scum , scum , scum , scum , scum ! ( SPITS ) The Vindaloovian Empire has pledged to exterminate them all . - We won 't rest until our task is completed . - Er , Lister . - Hi . - How 's it going , bud ? A human and a humanoid , a hologrammatical human and a mechanoid who is a slave to humans . I hoped for so much more . Whoever you are , boarding us is an act of war . Ergo , we surrender . And as prisoners of war , I invoke the All Nations Agreement , article 39436175880932 / B. 39436175880932 / B ? " All nations attending the conference are only allocated one parking space " ? Is that entirely relevant , sir ? I mean , here we are in mortal danger , and you 're worried about the Chinese delegates bringing two cars ? Can 't you let just one go ? I meant the right of POWs to non-violent constraint . That 's 75880932 / C , sir . It 's embarrassing as much as anything else . You 're totally humiliating me in front of this genocidal maniac . No offence . Primitive . You will be no sport at all . I have no alternative . - How long were we out ? - Navicomp says three weeks . Strange . The drive interface has been upgraded . So have the engines . If this readout 's correct , we 're armed . Laser cannons . They 've upgraded the whole ship . They 've even got rid of the squeak on the seat control . We have made some improvements to your craft . Now you may be of some small amusement . You have two minutes before we attack . - Let 's get out of here . - I know this game , cat and mouse . There 's only one way to win - don 't be the mouse . - What you saying ? - The mouse never wins . Not unless you believe those lying cartoons . Don 't run . Strike . It 's the last thing they 'll be expecting . No , the last thing they 'll be expecting is for us to turn into ice-skating mongooses . Your plan makes as much sense . - I say go with it . - Agreed . You 're going with one of my plans ? Are you nuts ? What if we get killed ? I 'll never hear the last of it ! What are they doing ? Power up the weapons . - Nailed him ! - Hit . - Take them with us . - Can 't return fire . Hack into their navigation computer . Transmit the Armageddon Virus . - What is it ? - The navicomp . Something 's wrong ! See you in Silicon Hell . Shutdown network . The navicomp 's been infected with a virus . The navicomp 's frozen . We 're locked on this course ! How long before we hit trouble ? If trouble 's a large moon in our path , about 38 minutes . Sir , I must contract the virus myself , analyse its structure and create an antidote before it wipes out my program . Do I have your permission ? Do lemmings like cliffs ? Granted . - I have to create a dove program . - Dove program ? A dove program spreads peace through the system , obliterating viral cells . I have it . The virus is extremely complex . I will have to dedicate all my run time . Shutting down all non-essential systems . Is there anything we can do ? Watch my dreams . - Twenty-three minutes to impact . Any change ? - Getting worse . Weaker and weaker . Look , we can 't all get out of this in one piece . - If we do , it 'll be one big flat piece . - And ? We should decide who takes the one-man escape pod . - How ? - If you bear with me , I think I 've devised a fair system of choosing who survives . It 's based on age , rank , seniority , usefulness ... To cut a long story short , it 's me . I was as stunned as you are and demanded a recount . But it came out as me again ! - Keys ? - The escape pod isn 't an option . - Why not ? - It escaped last Thursday . I was having a few beers and used the release mechanism as a bottle opener . - Whoosh ! - That 's it , then . We 're finished ! Wait . We 're getting something . ( HONKY-TONK PIANO ) ( CA T ) What is this ? ( LISTER ) I think we 've tapped directly into whatever passes for Kryten 's subconscious . ( CA T ) Why is he a sheriff in some old western ? ( LISTER ) Must be how his core program is coping . For whatever reason , it 's converted the struggle into some kind of dream . Well , well , well , Sheriff . Fancy seeing a man of your sober disposition in a low-down drinking establishment . Now , boys . I don 't want any trouble . Just doing my rounds . ( LAUGHTER ) You shouldn 't oughta have done that . Try it , Sheriff . They say you used to be faster than a toilet stop in rattlesnake country . Sorry , I tripped over your boot there . Didn 't mean any harm by it . Give me two fingers of your best sipping liquor , and make it the smooth stuff . The stuff where you get your eyesight back after two days . The Apocalypse Boys is here . They 's asking for you , Sheriff . I 'll be right out . Ah , I don 't believe I 've had the pleasure , sirs . Name 's Death . These here are my brothers . Brother War ... Brother Famine ... and Brother Pestilence . You seem like nice boys . How can I be of service ? We want your sorry ass out of here . You got one hour . He 's losing the battle . His life signs are barely registering . Isn 't there some way we can turn ourselves into tiny electronic people and get in there ? Isn 't there some gizmo someplace that can do that ? And if not ... why not ? ! Look , we 've all got something to bring to this discussion . - The thing you should bring is silence . - No , no , no . - I think he 's got something . - Twice in one lifetime ? When you 're hot , you 're hot ! If we link up the artificial reality console to Kryten 's mind , we should be able to project directly into his dream state . - Without even leaving the room . - What about me ? We 'll power up your hard light drive . Come on . Let 's get these wagons rolling . There . I 've loaded in some characters from an AR western game . Choose a player . - Two . - You 're the Riviera Kid . Special skills , ace gunslinger . - Rimsy ? - Uno . One . Dangerous Dan McGrew . Special skills , barefist fighting . Which leaves me with Brett Riverboat , knife man . - And we definitely can 't get hurt ? - No , you can get out at any time . There 's a button inside the glove . When you want to get out , just clap . OK , Riviera ? OK , Dangerous ? Let 's mosey on into town . ( WESTERN-STYLE MUSIC ) I 've seen westerns . I know how to speak cowboy . Leave the talking to me . Dry white wine and Perrier , please . And you chaps ? What westerns have you seen ? " Butch Accountant and the Yuppie Kid " ? Leave this to me . This sounds like one for ... ( MEXICAN ACCENT ) .. the Riviera Kid . ( FLAMENCO GUITAR ) Senorita , three tequila , por favor . - What ? - Three shots of gulping whisky , ma 'am . - ( CROAKS ) Mighty smooth . - I was expecting a little more kick to it . I don 't suppose you 've got any ginger ale ? I 'll take that as a no , then . ( RETCHES ) A man beans up in the hat of Bear Strangler McGee , he 's either mighty brave or mighty stupid . Which are you , boy ? Sorry , what were the choices again ? You 'll have to forgive our friend , he 's a gunman short of a posse . That pays for the hat . What about the insult ? OK . You 're a fat , bearded git . Take the lot . Rimmer , what is wrong with you ? Relax . You said yourself , no one can hurt us . Besides , you 're forgetting ... ( AMERICAN ACCENT ) I 'm Dangerous Dan McGrew , barefist fighter extraordinaire . Lola , all my valuables are in this box . You can have it for a bottle of mind-rotter . - You 're trading in your shooting irons ? - No use to me . I got the shakes bad . - Carrots ? - I 'm throwing in my mule , Dignity . Mr Sad Git or what ? Kryten , it 's us , man . I don 't believe I 've had the pleasure . Don 't you know who we are , why you 're here ? You 're fighting an electronic virus . You 're trying to create a dove program , a software antidote to wipe it out . - I 'll drink to that . - Listen , hooch-head . The virus is winning . You 've gotta start fighting it . Want a drink , Sheriff ? Come and take one . Now , there 's no need to make me look foolish . Come on , Sheriff . Jump ! You can get higher than that ! Leave him alone ! Just having a little fun , Mr Swankypants . The name 's Brett Riverboat , knife man . Let 's see how good you are . Son of a ... . Frank , Luke , line his lungs with lead . - Who the heck are you ? - Call me the Kid . - The Riviera Kid . - ( FLAMENCO GUITAR ) Well , let 's see if your shooting is as fancy as your dancing . He shot the bullets out of the air ! Well , it 's been dandy meeting you , but if I 'm not gone by sun up , buzzards will be fighting lizards for my gizzards . If he leaves , we 're dead . Stop him ! Vamonos , muchachos . - Marvellous ! - Hey , buddy ! Hold it ! You gotta stay ! - This is a job for the Riviera Kid ! - ( FLAMENCO GUITAR ) ( CLUNK ) Boys , I 've got to leave . It 's ten to Death . We 've got ten minutes to sober him up and get him in shape . Come on . - Sir , I just can 't eat any more raw coffee . - Two more bowls . But I am sober . Honest ! - OK , who are you and why are you here ? - I 'm a robot fighting this virus . None of this exists , except for you guys , who do exist , only you 're not really here , you 're on some spaceship . If that 's gotta make sense , I don 't want to be sober ! I got his guns back . Look , they 've got doves carved on them . And check this ... - There 's no place for the bullets . - This is it . The answer 's in these guns . - Doves . Dove program . - I don 't know . - I really don 't know . - ( CLOCK CHIMES ) Wait , something 's coming back now . You , sir , when I look at you I get an image of curry and early morning breath that could cut through bank vaults . You , sir ... there 's something familiar about you too . I get a name . ( STAMMERS ) Smee ... Smeeee ... heeeeee . - Smeghead ? - That 's it ! He remembers me . Do the guns mean anything to you ? Something . They mean something . - If only I had more time . - Psst ! Company . Got yourself a little help , Sheriff ? Now I remember . You 're a computer virus , travelling from machine to machine , overwriting the core program . Have infection , will travel . Let 's tip the balance a little here . What is he doing ? He 's stalling . He 's spotted us for what we are - a bunch of mean , macho , bad-ass desperados who are gonna kick his butt across the Pecos . ( SPITS ) Enjoy the show . Who 's got the guts to go with me one on one , mano a mano ? - Cover him . - ( FLAMENCO GUITAR ) Damn , I lost my special skills . ( CLATTER ) Rimmer , the virus has spread to the AR unit . We 've lost our special skills . Ah , Mr War , due to circumstances completely beyond my control , there 's been a cock-up in the bravado department . I may have appeared braver than I actually am . Exit ! Exit ! - We 're sealed in ! - Get the helmets off ! It won 't move ! The clasp at the back . I got one of my gloves off ! - And a boot too . - Oh , brilliant ! Now you 're paralysed down your left-hand side . - Me nose ! - I got it . - You 're pulling me nose off ! - Here it comes ! We 'll cut you up so small the worms won 't have to chew . You can 't frighten me . I 'm always scared . Lister ! - What now ? - It 's down to Kryten . Well , Sheriff . Now it 's just little old you . I 'm not afraid . My friends have bought me enough time to complete the antidote . Now , if you 'll forgive the rather confrontational imperative , go for your guns , you scum-sucking molluscs . I did it ! I created an antidote . Two minutes to impact . Come on ! - How long will it take ? - A few seconds . - How long to impact ? - Just a few seconds . - Loading . It 's in the navicomp . - Eight seconds ... Seven ... - Nearly there . - Five ... Four ... - Three ... Two ... - We 're not going to make it ! - ( CAT ) Impact ! - ( CRASH ) ( ALL ) Yeeeeeeeee-aaaaah ! ( WESTERN-STYLE MUSIC )

 - Hey , Gary , what 's up ? - I 'm sponging down my locker . It was starting to reek . I 've never seen you clean anything before . What 's this ? You got an " A " on myer 's quiz ? Who did you copy off of ? No one . I just applied myself , I guess . Hey , does this smell like a gentle spring rain of you ? - Hi , Gary . - Paula , hi . Thank for sharing your cinnamon roll . Next time nibble off mine . - ( Bell Ringing ) - ( Air Hissing ) - What 's going on here , Gary ? - What do you mean ? Something 's different with you . All of sudden you 're getting A 's Paula sparks wants to nibble ... And your butt 's whistling ! ( Screaming ) ( Whimpers ) Gary ? Hey , Wyatt . How was your day ? - Okay , you can drop the act . - Act ? Cyberspace getting old so you thought you 'd screw with my head ? - What do you mean ? - This . I spent the last hour scraping my best friend off my shoes . - Oh , that . - Gotcha ! Bet you thought it was me , huh ? Told you he 'd buy it . It 's the old my-friend-is-a - double-made-out-of-gum gag . I should have seen the connection . my best friend chews gum . My best friend 's made fo gum . I didn 't mean to freak you out . The bubble double was a test run . I 'm relieved your cruel prank has some purpose . We should have told him . Here 's what I 'm thinking . Lisa zaps up a couple more bubble doubles . Let them hassle with book reports dodge ball face burns . We hit the slopes for three years and come back for senior skip day . What are you , insane ? I won 't drop out for three years while some walking mound of bubble yum ... - A week ? - A week 's good . You won 't bitch about cutting class ? - We 're not making up work . - I know . Wait a minute . - Ow ! - Sorry . I thought you were a bubble double . I could use a break from school too . You heard him . Give that man a gum ball . Wyatt , hold out your hand . Go ahead . Chew it . I don 't get a fresh one ? There 's not some magic gum ball machine full of these . Hmm . Hasn 't lost its flavor . LISA : Just put your lips together and blow . Very impressive . Great craftsmanship . Did you have to make then so ... naked ? What 's wrong ? Don 't you like your clone ? He doesn 't look anything like me ... down there . - I took a guess . - You guessed wrong . I never realized I had such a gracefully sloping spine . - Hey , looking good . - Right back at you , bad boy . You are one sharp dresser . Are those stone washed ? Uh , yeah . I got them a couple weeks ago . I 'd love to borrow them . If they look that good on you they 'll look great on me . Yech . What a couple of butt-kissers . At can we do for you- - homework , chores , ask , your parents for money ? Just name it . It 's done . Okay . You sure you remember where everything is ? - Evme ? - Sure . Just go enjoy yourselves . Wyatt , let 's drop the doublemint twins already and go . I 'm having second thoughts . My clone 's not doing a convincing job playing me . He 's right , Gary . I 'm having second thoughts too . I 'm not doing a convincing job playing him . I take that back . He is good . Come on , guys . We 've only got a week . ( Laughing ) Dude ! That was awesome , dude ! Buddy , radical moguls , buddy . Will you two please stop talking that way ? Lisa , an amazing week . Thank you . Welcome back . Missed that smile . Hey , it 's our guys . Nice shades . Mmm . Can I borrow those sometimes ? They 're yours . - Fresh-baked ginger snap ? - Ooh , thanks . You guys get through the week okay ? No problem . You have a book report due in history class tomorrow . Here it is , but I have to double-check the footnotes . Could you put this in one of those plastic things ? What 's up with that ? A week was the deal and the week 's over . - Ow ! - Oop . Sorry . Over here . Wait . Hold up . We could still use these guys . They 're only bubbles . They can 't live your lives . Who said they should live our lives ? We want them to take over the lame parts- - Go to school , or help out around the house . - They make a great cookie . - You won 't do anything crazy ? No . We just want them around in case of an emergency , or ... - mid-terms . - All right . Do what you want but good luck scraping them off the floor . Here 's a thought . We inflate our bubble-doubles for gym . Send them on the rope climb and stash them behind our ears for the rest of the day . Is it me , or is everybody unusually friendly today ? Morning , baby . Hi ... Paula ... baby . I 'm really looking forward to this afternoon . - You and me ? - Well , yeah . Oh , Gary , don 't even pretend like you forgot . - The debate team finals ? - I 'm not on the debate team . You save those clever retorts for the competition . Hi , Wyatt . - Monya ? - I was so inspired by your speech in assembly last week that I went home and I built my own compost heap . Uh ... big thumbs up . So , are you nervous about this afternoon ? No . - Why ? Should I be ? - Oh , yeah . You 're nervous . Break a leg . Bye . I 'm starting to get the feeling we stayed away too long . I hate musicals . The gum 's been busy . I never trusted the gum . ( Whistling ) ( Glass Breaking ) - Do you know the file command ? - I saw everything . Well , well , well ... What do we have here ? Gary and Wyatt- - couple of guys , naked . - Want a ginger snap ? - No . Thanks . I had one chance at debate team finals and I lost because of you . I didn 't know there were rules about not agreeing with the other side . How can you be so brilliant one day and so totally brain-dead the next ? Don 't you ever offer me a danish again . Looks like your day has been almost as humiliating as mine . I doubt that . Thanks to my bubble-double I 'm on the diving team , the debate team and I 've lettered in interpretive dance . Gee . I 'd burst into tears except I have to learn my lines for an entire musical , in two hours . Look . We 'll just reinflate your double and send him out for his song and dance . Then we 'll deflate them for the cast party . I hear those drama girls are easy . - Uh-oh . - Hi , guys . - What 's up ? - Our gum wads are gone . - Oh , I threw those away . - What ? Why ? They were all covered with lint , little hairs , icky . Okay . Then zap up a couple more . Only this time could you make the next pair a little more mellow ? That last batch went hyper-achievement on us . How about a couple of root beer floats ? - Sure . Okay . - Just not too foamy . I 'll run down to the kitchen and pour a couple mugs . - Why don 't you just zap them up ? - Because ... zapping always makes the ice cream all lumpy . Be right back . Hey , Gar , I don 't remember leaving Lisa out - of the computer this morning . - We didn 't . No ice cream in the freezer . I 'll have to run to the 7-eleven . - Anyone got a 20 ? - Forget the floats . I know how to test her . How would you like to have sex with me right now , in the shower ? Okay . She 's fine . You got a shower cap ? Gary , it 's not our Lisa ! You 're right . That able bitch can 't help you now . Nobody can . I 'm going to put an end to your simpering , pathetic lives once and for all . - She 's a bubble-double ! - The dart ! The dart ! Good idea . - Aim high ! You need ayeah . - Okay . Aim high ? I hope she kills you first . Eat gum , flesh boys . She 's gone . Gone ... Relax . It wasn 't our Lisa . It was some hideous replicant made out of gum . But it was going to shower with me . That stuff really sticks . I may have to shave my arms . Oh , no ! Lisa 's file is gone . The gum boys must have download her . Lisa 's been download ? Lisa 's gone forever ? No , downloaded mean copied . - Oh , that 's not so bad . - We need to find Lisa 's disk . And find out what the doubles are up to . Only one way to find out . Can 't you pump any faster ? - Her lips keep slipping off . - Try the ear . All right , gum-head , star- - Look , guys , I 've been thinking . You want to sashay around buck naked fine by me . I 've seen my share of rump in boot camp . So it 's not like I have a , uh ... problem with it . I wasn 't staring then and I 'm not staring now . So , let 's just put the whole ugly incident behind us . - Agreed ? - ALL : Yeah , sure . As you were . - So where 's the real Lisa ? - The gum boys took her . They made me to dispose of you two flesh-bags . Once you were out of the way they planned to take over - your lives , permanently . - Geez , what did we ever do to them ? Yeah , they 're just a couple of gum balls Lisa created to serve us , to make our lives more fun . What lives ? You two are barely living yours . The gum boys value what you take for granted . Sure , they 're only made of gum but they make better human beings than you two ever will . - Harsh . - They 're smarter , more talented , more popular , better-looking better at sports , better dancers , more fun . I 've heard enough . They 've taken Lisa . They 've taken our lives . I say it 's time to kick a little juicy fruit butt . All right , okay , here 's the plan : this weekend , my parent 's house at the lakes . Jet skis , jacuzzis and a 24-hour barbecue pit . All compliments of mom and dad . All right . My parents are letting them stay at the lake house ? They don 't even let me in the formal dining room . Look at me- - I 'm having the time of my life . And I 'm flirting . I look great in that shirt . The head was right . They are better at being us than we are . - Maybe they deserve our lives . - No , don 't say that . I mean , sure , they 're more outgoing and popular better with women , more articulate ... - What 's your point ? - They 're not us . They 're gum . But look how confident they are . It 's easy for them to be confident . What do they have to lose , flavor ? Sure we have a lot of problems but those problems make us who we are . I would rather be a screwed-up human than a smooth-talking stick of gum . You 're right . I want my life back . If anybody 's going to screw up our lives it 's going to be us . Let 's go get them . Wait ! We can 't just pop them . We got to find out what they did with Lisa 's disk . Let 's do that thing we did to that guy at that place that time . Good plan . Congratulations on the student council election . Thank you , Mr. Wallace . Congratulations on scoring a date with Sophia Ruby . We 'll load Lisa 's disk on to your computer . Then we 'll call her up and wish for her to make us real . Ah , life is good . ( Sharp Rap ) - You okay ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . One down . I heard you aced the debate after the flesh-bag almost blew it . Yeah , thanks . Anyway , speaking of Lisa - maybe we should check on her disk . - Ah , she 's okay . Yeah , but I still want to make sure . We 've been so busy being perfect guys I don 't remember where we put the darn disk . - Do you remember ? - Sure thing , bubble-buddy . - She 's right here . - Thank you . Hey , what do you know ? I 'm real . I 'll see you melting on a hot sidewalk in hell , gum-bag . Now ! Sorry . Haven 't used this since summer camp . We got to think like gum . Where would gum go ? Where would gum hide ? Check under the selts . We need a password . If we get split up you won 't be able to tell who 's who . Let 's make it something I won 't forget like a supermodel . Okay , how about Elle MacPherson ? - No , she 's an actress now . - Kathy Ireland ? - Ugh , her voice squeaks . - Kate Moss . The wait chick ? Works for me . Wyatt ? Kate Ross ! Kate Ross ! Kate Ross ! Kate Ross ! See , I told you the password would pay off . Wyatt , where have you been ? Everyone else is in costume . The show starts in ten , Miss Bouvier , I can 't go out there . You 're going to have to send in the understudy . Gary ? Are you ready ? ( Hoarsely : ) Uh , laryngitis . Wyatt , it 's up to you . Relax , you 'll be fine . You just have a case of the opening night jitters . No , it 's bigger than that . I don 't know the play . Oh , that 's nonsense . Your rendition of " Sunrise , sunset " made me cry . It did ? But I can 't sing ! Of course , you can . Trust your instrument . Oh , man , I have to play an instrument ? You touched me before , Wyatt . Now go out there and touch me again . Son of a gun , I 'm feeling much better . Wyatt ? - Okay . - Good . Someone bring me Tevya 's coat and milk bucket . - Find my double ! - I will . Break a leg . MAN : Two minutes to curtain . I have to find something sharp , pointy , deadly . Close enough . Hey , thanks . ( Sniffs ) I know that smell . That 's ... hubba-bubba . If only you were a little smarter . A little faster . It 's time to get to your liquid center , flesh-boy . This is going to be true chewing satisfaction . You call this a fair fight ? Wyatt ! Pop him , Wyatt ! Pinch his butt ! Pinch his butt ! What ? It 's his weak spot . You pinch it ! It 's your butt . Wait ! You don 't want to pop me . In two minutes you 're going to have to go sing and dance in front of the entire school . You don 't know the play . But I do ! I can make you look good and you know it . You got to keep me around just this once . You know I 'll do a better job than you . Thanks . I 'll do it myself . You did the right thing . I would have waited till after the show . Wyatt , you 're on . You 're ready ? Absolutely . Is it too late to ask for a teleprompter ? All right , Wyatt ! You are Tevya ! Hi . Good luck . Break a leg . Can 't let it get to me . Got to confront the demons . Show ' em my warrior face . I 'm going in . Boys , I just want you to know ... Afternoon , soldier . - Hey , Chett . - Hey , Chett . Captioned by Grantman Brown

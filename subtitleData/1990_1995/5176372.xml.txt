Well , we drank , and you left . Then I picked up the blonde . - No , you didn 't . - Yeah , I did ! - She wasn 't even interested in you . - You left , she got interested , all right ? You owe me 20 bucks for your drinks . Here is the update of the new filing system . It 's a shocking computer disk . You press that , and within three seconds it shocks you . - Cure for the common hangover . Is it working ? - Are your parents related ? - No . - No ? Well , I think they are ... - Morning , Lisa . - Morning , Fred . Out of your league , man . Did you read the profile ? Ph.D. at 25 . The chick 's got no social life . Look at that . She doesn 't even smoke . He knows that . He 's offered her a cigarette before . What a jerk . Look . Whenever she 's nervous , she brushes her hair back over her right ear . You see that ? Right over the right ear . - Hm-m-m ! This has gone on for six months . What if just go over there and talk to her . What , and spoil our relationship ? No . Right . Your peeping Tom thing is really much healthier . - Guess what ? - What ? - Time to leave my cubicle . - Right now ? - If I had a door , I 'd open it . Excuse me , Barry Thomas ?

I was watching the news and you were very impressive . Miss Jackson , two of my assistants have been removed by some paperwork that Mr. Thomas signed . - Really ? - I 've already sent two memos to him regarding the subject ... - ... and gotten no response . - I don 't think I 've got those . Let me help you personally , Dr. Moxley . Come into my office ... That won 't be necessary , Miss Jackson . Just put them back in the system . Lewis Hope , Thomas Plume . - Done . - Miss Jackson , we all make mistakes . Just correct it . - Yes , Sir . - Thank you . Good day . - Good day . - Ann , we have just hundreds of people go ... - You made me look like an idiot ! You 're off of technical staff . Off . You 'll take and file résumés , and that 's it . Howard , would you believe it , Howard is now in charge of technical staff ! You ... You bounced the head of the Program ' assistants ! - I , I ... One , one more slip-up , and you 're bounced . You got it ? - Yeah . Good day . FIND A NEW JOB OR DIE ! Rattled ! The whole office , rattled ! You slow down the work and we all suffer , you know that . Let 's hug . Just once . It 'll break the tension . - Just slop me on some of that macaroni . - Yes , Sir . Oh ... That is just terrifying ! Excuse me ? Are you all right ? - You don 't smoke . - What are you talking about ? You don 't smoke . I 'd offer you a cigarette , but you don 't smoke , so why bother even ? Rico , some string beans , please . - I don 't smoke either . - And some rice , too . So even if you did smoke , I couldn 't offer you a cigarette . I just don 't smoke , so sorry to bother you . Where are you usually locked up ? Oh , I 'm just an experiment gone horribly awry in the Personnel department . I see . - I 'm Lisa Fredericks . - I 'm Barry Thomas . What is it that you do ? Oh ... Nothing . I just sort of boost morale in between threats of being fired . Ah . Well , you seem to have a mind . That doesn 't usually fit in the system . - Nice to meet you . - Nice meeting you , too . - Bye-bye . - Goodbye . And good luck ! I 'm not shipping off the continent . I 'm just having lunch . Right , right . Thiaahhh ... So , uh , she likes me ... A lot . Wouldn 't you agree ? Yeah . I 'd say that you and an ice cream headache are probably neck and neck . Do I always sound like such an idiot , or do I save it for the people I really want to impress ? You 're just thinking the wrong way , man . - What if the ice queen thing 's an act , a deffence ? - O.k. All right ? What if she 's a lonely one ? Huh ? She 'd be thankful to the first guy that came over to her and said anything . I know these things , man . I know ! I picked up the blonde last night , Right ? Right . - Um , right . - She 's to be talked to . - I got an air conditioning repair for ... Dr. Specter ? - Sure . - Uh ... Ahem . - Yeah , go ahead . LISA FREDERICKS Â131 Yes ? Barry Thomas . I 'm here to see Dr. Fredericks . There 's a slight problem in Personnel . - You going to erase her from the computer , too ? - It 's regarding her paycheck . We 're updating our filing system , and I have to verify some personal information , ... Miss ... Zevo . Otherwise , her check may be delayed . - Well , that 's the type of confusion we always expect from Personnel . - Thank you . Well , you don 't seem to be doing very well today ! - Get out of my office ! Now ! - Goodbye . Who are you ? Are you authorized to be back here ? It 's all right . It 's all right . Just come in and shut the door . I 'll just come in and shut the door . I was just taking care of Dr. Moxley , I was helping out with one of ... Hey ! I have a geranium plant at home ! That 's funny . - What can I do for you ? - Nothing . Nothing . I was just in the neighborood , so I thought I 'd say " Hello " . Hello ! You came back in the middle of a restricted area to flirt with me ? - Is this ... a bad time ? - We spoke for 10 seconds on a food line . That gives you the right to come back into my office and hit on me ? - No , no , I would ... - You don 't seem to get the point . I don 't consider playful banter over steaming string beans - grounds for romantic trysts , sexual advances , or even ... Can you get out from behind there ? - Ah , yeah . ... Even a long-distance friendship . I 'm not even interested in a pen pal . It was great seeing you , too . I 'm sorry , Barry , but timimg 's everything , and this just isn 't the time . It 's not the time , right ? - How 'd it go ? - Oh , good , good , thanks . I 'll be alone for the rest of my life . Thanks , pal . Drinks tonight ? Yes , Howard . Let 's just drink our lives away . Shall we ? O.k. - Barry , what 's up , man ? You with me ? Let 's do it ! - Coming . - Hi , Ronaldo . - Señorita ! Ah . My dozen , please .

No . No , I didn 't know her at all . - I 'm sorry , Barry . I know how much you cared about her . - I 'm quitting tomorrow . - What ? - Getting on with my life . - What are you talking about ? And what about me ? By staying on that job one more day , what do I have ? What do I have ? I have my pants behind a desk , that 's what I have . - We need two more of these , please . - My dad said I 'd never amount to much . I don 't want to disappoint him . Look , man , I don 't know what you 're talking about . Whatever happened today was horrible , but it doesn 't stop us . We got to keep on going . Are you going to turn back ? - Maybe . - No . - Time ? - The time is 12 : 00 o 'clock . I wonder what she was thinking about . Not about me , that 's for sure . Lazy boy . - I don 't have time for this . - The time is 12 : 01 . The time is 7 : 35 AM . Please wake up . Wake up . Wake up . Oh , please . I have a hangover . Lazy boy , please wake up . Please wake up . No , I don 't . ... This cutting edge project by researchers in particle physics has been shut down by Goverment order . Hosea ? Mary , big news at Utrel Corporation . Researchers here working on particle physics believe they 've discovered a way to accelerate a subatomic particle faster than the speed of light . They are using a groundbreaking device called a superaccelerator . Come on , Hosea ! That 's old news . What about Lisa 's murder ? ... finally ordered the complete shutdown of the project . This tool will help us to finally define the nature of the Universe and harness its energy . Now , imagine a faculty this size powering half of the state of California . - It 's remarkable . - If we could actually power a particle faster than the speed of light , the energy released would be catastrophic . Time and space would be shattered . We 'd be punched backwards in time and then move forward , until the accelerator is fired again , And we 'll punch back again in an endless loop , like a skipping record . This circular time bounce would become our prison , and we 'd be prisoners without memory in a cell without a key . Which theory is true ? Another tune going out over the KBRY lovers ' request ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . " Scientist killed at work " . Come on . ... and temperatures will diminish by early next week . We may ... One of us fell down last night . Oh , man , I 'm going to be late again . O.k. , I was drunk . Hello . Hi ... Mom , I ... I 'm running late again . How are you ? Yeah , right . It 's been a real long time since we talked . I did . I did meet a girl . No , I don 't think you 're going to meet her . Because she was shot . No , not ... not with cameras , with bullets . Mom , I ... I got to go . I 'll call you later . O.k ... I was really drunk . That 's not how you throw the ball ! Pathetic . What 's wrong with you ? Talk about pathetic . - Didn 't I tell you to be more careful ? - Up yours , my man . All right ! Now we 're getting somewhere ! Where are the quarterlies ? Jackson 's ready to cut your throat ! On her desk . Calm down . Comb your hair . Iron your pants . Jack , would you believe nothing was in the paper about Lisa Fredericks ? Why , she won an award or something ? - Aah ! Oh ! - Oh , Jack , I 'm so sorry ! Can I help ? I 'll get you some more coffee . - No , no ! Thanks . Howard ... Damn it ! This isn 't funny ! - Well , look who decided to show up ! - Ann , I cleaned off this whole desk yesterday before I left . You know I 'm doing you a favor , don 't you , keeping you on with a work performance like yours . So let 's finish the personnel reports , complete the monthly billing , and clean up the desk by the end of day . - I did this work ! - I can see that . - We both know , if you wanted to get on time , you would , right ? - There was a car accident ... - Again . - Barry , Barry , Barry , I don 't want to fight with you , and either to be your friend , do I ? So let 's just do the work . I 'd hate to kick you out . You 're one of the cute ones . Ow ... Did you see that ? She came in here just like it was yesterday . You know , she had sex once in 1983 , but she didn 't like it . Here 's the update of the new filing system . Wow , wow ! You think I 'm a cretinius moron , who 'd fall for the same trick twice ? - Trick ? - The shocking disk trick . You got me yesterday . Ehey , how come Lisa Fredericks ' murder wasn 't on TV , wasn 't in the newspapers , nothing ? Lisa 's murder ? Oh , come on , Howard , stay with me , please . You were standing right next to me , when she was shot last night , right ? Ghhh ! We talked to the police together ! We went drinking last night . You 're supposed to remind me I 'm quitting today . Homicides , please . Detective ... Uh ... Kryles . We drank . You left . I tried to pick up the blonde , I paid for all drinks , she blew me off , I watched Batman at home , called the power line ... No , no , no . The blonde was two nights ago . You said you scored . Detective Kryles ? You questioned me last night about Lisa Fredericks ' murder . Lisa Fredericks . She was killed last night . Well , I saw it , I was there . You were there , you questioned me . Hello ? He hung up the phone . You called him , didn 't you ? Yeah . You set this whole gag up . I 'l go pretty far for a jocke , but I don 't cover up homicides . Lisa ? It 's fine . Please get the other papers to me by noon . - Lisa ! - Yes ? Barry from the lunch line . You ... You kicked me . I can 't get over this . Sorry . You must be mistaken with somebody else . - You were dead ! I thought you were dead ! - No , very much not . And I hope my condition continues . Goodbye . - Good morning , Lisa ! - I 'm just so happy you 're all right ! - Look , I 'm sorry , but ... - Who is he ? - I really don 't know . I don 't know you . - Cigarette ? - No , thanks . Good bye ! Shall we get this over with ? Miss Jackson , we all make mistakes . Just correct it . - Absolutely . - Good day ! - Good day ! - Dr . Moxley , rest assured ... - What 's going on ? - Tell her I 'm not involved . You made me look like an idiot ! - You 're off of the technical staff . Off ! - Fine ! - You 'll take résumés and file résumés . That 's it . Howard , from now on you 'll handle technical staff . I can 't believe I 'm saying that . You bounced the Head of the Department 's two assistents ! Ehey , Ann ! I cared of that yesterday ! - One more slip-up like this , one more ! , and you 're bounced . Got it ? - Mm-hmm . Bounced . PICK UP FISH FOOD Hey , come on , man ! Come on , that 's my paper ! Come on . TIME BOUNCE THEORY POSES POSSIBLE THREAT . Dr. Moxley . I 'm Barry Thomas . We met yesterday . - Are you Thomas ? - Yes . We haven 't met . Anyway , that matter 's taken care of . I heard on the news about a time bounce ... The time just stops , goes back , and repeats . They used all my remarks out of context . But I can 't relate it even . It 's very complicated . But , Dr. Moxley , I think the time bounce has happened . This day is repeating . - What an unusual thing to say . - But I 've seen it ... Things are repeating all over the place . Mr. Thomas , if the bounce were to happen , everything would loop back to a starting point . Your memmory would also be reset along with the rest of the Universe . The fact that you think you remember it means it hasn 't happened . - Don 't worry about it . Good day ! - But ... Great . Rattled ! The whole office , rattled ! You slow down the work , and we all suffer . You know that . Right , right . I 'm sorry about how I came out to you this morning . It must have been a shock . Are you assuming this morning 's encounter 's made us friends and now we can have a conversation ? No ! No ! God , no ! That 's the last think on my mind ! Good . Can I have string beans and rice , please , Rico ? I just hate meeting new and interesting , and attractive people . Don 't you even think to start a conversation with me ! Can I please have macaroni ? Thank you . - I 'm sorry . I didn 't catch your name . - Me ? Uh , Barry . Barry Thomas . Would you like to have lunch with me today ? Well , I 'm sure you 're nice , but I just don 't think so . - Oh , come on , I 'll make it worth your while . - How 's that ? Well , I 'll pay for your lunch . I promise not to spit food in your face or make silly noises with my lips . Thank you . What do you say ? - O.k. - Thank you . Help ! I 'm strictrly into theory . No grease stains . The physical world is just too disappointing . Yeh , but to get your hands dirty and use your mind , and create the things ... That 's the exciting part ! Isn 't it ? Thinks don 't always work out the way you want them to , Barry . Lisa , you shouldn 't pick up men at lunch . You don 't know where they 've been . Joan , this ist Barry . Please eat something . You 're getting mean . - Not wearing the ring . - Wow ! - You are .. ? - Oh , relax . Her sister gave it to her . She 's available . Aside from dinner with me tonight , her schedule 's open . - Oh , you 're not very subtle on private note ... - You 're not gonna make that dinner . Oh , yes , I am . Joan will murder me , if I flake out on her . - Again . - It 's only twice . - O 'k . No . I mean you 're not going to make that dinner tonight . Why not ? This day is repeating . The time bounce has happened . Right after work , at 6 : 15 you go across the street to buy flowers , and you 're ... shot . I 've already seen it . You 've got to believe me . People are saying the same things that they said yesterday . They 're doing the same things . The news has the same story . It 's all happening again the same way ! - O.k , prove it . Point something out . - O.k ! I haven 't been paying attention . - I 'll make it easier . What do I do next ? - Your beeper goes off , and you leave ! I hope you 've had fun with your little game . Call me when you grow up . You have to believe me ! You get shot two times ! - Stop ! Can I help you ? - Uh , Personnel . Going to see Dr. Moxley . He 's expecting me . O.k. Fine . Go ahead . Looks like it 's contained . Just in that one seal . One seal or if they where fourty , it would be the same ! But this means we can 't shut the accelerator down today . Lisa , we don 't have a choice ! We 've got to keep the accelerator fully operational , until we get the situation under control . This could be a catastrophe ! If one more seal has broken , we would have irradiated the entire lab . - It was in perfect condition . I don 't understand what happened ! - It 's a terrible embarrassement . We tell them it 's safe , and now we can 't dismantle the core for at least two weeks ! I 'll get a cleanup crew immediatelly . - I 'm sorry , Thadius . - It 's not your fault , Lisa . For 40 years something 's gone wrong with every damned project I 've worked on ! Well , you 're bound for a change , then . Maybe the next project will hit . No , this is the last project I 'm to supervise . The way the press is handling this ... I can 't take any further disappointmernts . - What if you check the other seals ? - No cleanup until 10 A.M. tomorrow . I 'll go check those other seals and structures now . Wait a minute . I 'll examine them ! I 'll determine what happen ! - No , let her do it . - Thadius , it 's my job ! One more seal breaks , we 'll be reading at night by our own glow ! This is my department ! Thadeus ! - I want her to do it ! - Thadeus , I 've been with this project since the very beginning . It 's my expertese ... - You 've caused enough problems . - How did you get in here ? - I want security down here immediately ! - Security , get down at the acelerador . Take those files to level three . And call Mr. Stevens . I need to speak to him by 4 : 00 . Get me some coffee , some fresh ... coffee . Surprise ! Employee of the month ! You trespass into the highest level security area . You accost three heads of the project , and I 'm supposed to explain it . I like you , Barry . I really do . You 're fired . Give me your I.D. and clean out your office by the end of day . You know what 's funny ? If today was really today , I would have quit by now . - Hey , sorry , man . - Yeah , well , stuff happens . What 's up ? They fire you ? Will you believe me , if I tell you something that sounds impossible ? Well , yeah . Try me . Lisa Fredericks is going to be murdered today at 6 : 15 . This whole day is repeating . We 're in a time bounce ! Did you tell anyone ? - Yes ! - That 's why they fired you ! It 's O 'k . You 're stressed out . We can explane it . You have " dèjá vu " or vertigo , or something . But , but .. There have laws against this , don 't they ? They can 't fire you . Howard , up yours ! Sorry , man . Dr. Fredericks , please . Will you have her call Barry Thomas , extension 322 ? It 's urgent . - Your I.D. , Sir . - I ... - Sir , I can 't let you in there without an I.D ! - Lisa ! - Hi , Ronaldo ! - Ah , Señorita ! - ¿ Cómo está ? - Good . Do you have my roses ? Barry , hold it ! What 's up ? What 's going on , man ? - Mire . - Talk to me ! Lisa ! Get down ! Oh , this can 't be happening . This can 't be happening ! Uh ... what I can say is I ... I came out before Barry , when I heard the shooting ... - Excuse me , Sir . Barry Thomas ? - All right , Detective , do you believe me now ? You 'll have to come along to answer some questions . Wait , hold on a second ! He already gave a statement . We were crossing the street together . And she ... um ... he didn 't do anything ! He called me this morning to tell me about her murder . Now , do you want to go to jail , too ? CHARGE : ACCESSORY TO MURDER - This day 's about to repeat . - Yeah , no kidding , kid . They 're all about the same around here . Oh , my God ! But what if it doesn 't ? - I want another chance ! - Hey ! No more chances , man . You 're doing time now ! The time is 7 : 35 ... O.k. Today I 'll save her . Well , look who decided to show up ! Ann , you 're absolutely right . If I wanted to be here on time , I would . I 'll just finish the personnel reports , complete the montly billing , and clean off my desk by the end of the day . You don 't want to fight and also be my friend either . So why kick me out , when I 'm so damn cute ? - M-m-m-m . Howard ! - What ? Get rid of that stain . That 's good work , man . You almost prevented her from talking entirely . You don 't remember a thing about yesterday , do you ? What 's to remember , man ? We had some drinks , I picked up the blonde after you left ... - No . She blew you off . You went home . You watched Batman . - What ? Howard , I want to explain something to you , but you 're not gonna believe me , so just trust me . I need to talk to Dr. Moxley . He 's gonna be here in about 30 seconds . But first I have to talk to Lisa out on the hallway . So , when Moxley gets here , I want you to keep him here . You got it ? Good . - Hold on , Dr. Moxley , the Head of the Department ? - That 's him , yes . - How do you know that ? - Trust me . I know . - Jess ! Lisa ! The time bounce ... - Yes ? ... is a fascinating theory , don 't you think ? - Excuse me , who are you ? - Oh , I 'm Barry Thomas . Oh , you seem to know your name very well and you seem to know mine . Look , I know you 're in a hurry and I don 't mean to sound forward , but I 'm having lunch in the cafeteria at 12 : 30 . Personally I hate meeting new and interesting , and attractive people . I 'd much rather eat by myself , but if we have to , if we have to , isn 't it better to discuss how wonderful theory is and how disappointing the physical world can be ? - Wow ! That 's quite a qualified pickup line ! - Don 't tell me about ist . I 've been working it out for two days now . - Enjoy your very nice morning ! - And so please , 12 : 30 . Don 't forget ! - Who 's that ? - I have no idea . Cigarette ? She doesn 't smoke . You 've been working here , for what , four years now ? Pay attention ! - How 'd you know about Moxley ? - Moxley was already here ? - You made me look like an idiot ! - I said you to keep him ... - You 're off of technical staff ! - I know , I know all about it . Dr. Moxley ? - Joan , I need the isotope studies from Dr. Morgenrau . - I 'll be there to say him ... Let 's fire it just once ! If we 're right , we disprove Einstein . That 's pretty groundbreaking work . Of course it 's ! It 's been three years of my life . What are we supposed to do , break the low ? Some people would . Look . They told us to pull the plug , and we 're pulling it . Don 't make it more difficult than already is . O.k. O.k. Oh , by the way , I saw some coolant studies in the lab . They look like yours . That 's funny . I thought I brought them all back . - Albert , I 'm sorry I snapped . It 's not about you . - All right , forget it . Oh , Marlyn , do you have those papers ? - This afternoon soon enough ? - Yeah , fine . Thank you . 09 : 11 - JACK AND ANNETTE COLLIDE WITH TE COFFEE 09 : 15 - MOXLEY ENTERS 09 : 17 - LISA IN CORRIDOR 12 : 30 - LUNCH WITH LISA 13 : 00 - LISA 'S BEEPER GOES OFF 13 : 40 - UTILITY MAN 18 : 15 - LISA KILLED Shut up ! I believe , you wanted the string beans . They 're quite excelent today . You are a very unusual person . So , what do you do again ? I used to work in Personnel . Now I 'm sort of trying to figure out my life . - You 're changing jobs ? - No , no . The job is the same every morning . I want to show you something . Look over there in the lunch line there . Do you see those two people ? They 're about to bump each other . And that woman there ? She 's gonna sneak an olive of the salad bar . See that guy ... right there ? - He 's going to sneeze . - Ah-choo ! O.k. , You 're psychic . No . No , I 'm just learning to appreciate the moment . It seems to be all I have anymore . Do you believe in second chances ? No . Um , no , I don 't . What if ... What if the time bounce really happened and you had a second chance ... to know someone ? Someone you watched from a distance and then got closer to ? Someone you talked to once and really got to know . Like what their favorite flower was ? Like red roses . Well , you could have seen me buy them . Your ring ? Your sister gave you that ring . Joan sat there yesterday and told me . She 's supposed to be here today , but something happened . She 's not here . I told her I had lunch date . This is very weird . - Look , you 're a scientist . Let 's talk theory . The time bounce must have happ ... - Barry ! Oh , excuse me , Dr. Fredericks . I 've just had a compliant that Mr. Thomas was seen in your office this morning . - What ? Look , I was passing by and saw Denk in your office . And he was looking in your files , and he took something , while you were checking in the coolant studies ... I 'm so sorry . If I 'd known about this , I 'd have fired him immediately . - I made a time map of everything that happened ... - What were you doing in Wing B ? At 6 : 15 you go across the street and you buy some flowers and ... I know it sounds crasy , but you 're killed . You 're shot . I 've seen it twice now ! - You 're fired ! You have one hour . One hour to klean out your desk . - Fine ! I 'll do it ! - You 're fired ! Get out ! - Goodbye ! Your beeper 's about to go off ! Ohh ... Dr. Fredericks , I am so sorry . Oh . Well ... What a disappointment . Actually , I didn 't hire him . He was here when I came . - Hey , sorry . - Thanks , Jack . - What happened ? Did she fire you ? - I need a yellow utility worker badge . Why ? Listen , man , I want to have children , o.k. ? Stay away from my stuff . Jackson will castrate me . She doesn 't come back until 1 : 20 . That 's when she fired me yesterday . We got four minutes . So , the air-conditioning repair guy goes into the science wing at 1 : 40 . That 's 24 minutes from now . - Whip me up a work requisition order . I could fake my way through . - No , I don 't know ... People can die of stress , Barry ! It happens . It 's happening to me ! What are you doing , redecorating ? I 'll have to be crossing guard at a feminist camp for the rest of my life ! - Yes , Miss Jackson . - Oh God , look , look what you 've done ! And call me Mr. Stevens . I need to speak to him by 4 : 00 . Get me some coffee , some fresh coffe . Oh , Miss Jackson , what happened ? Annette , what did you do to my chair ? - I-I-I-I-I-I don 't understand ... Promise me , you won 't have a large furry pungent bear-child coming out of your chest ! - Just promise me ! - Promise . Hey , how ya doin ' ? I have to repair an air-conditioning unit for Dr. Specter . Where 's your uniform ? They told me to carry a window , but they didn 't tell the paint was wet . Right ? I 'll get another one . Go ahead . - Ahem . I have an air-conditioning repair for a Dr. Moxley . - This says Dr. Specter 's office . Oh ! Moxley , Specter . What 's the difference ? All these offices are interconnected . It could be 100 degrees in there tomorrow morning . Just sign this . - I don 't understand what happened ! - This is a terrible embarrassment for me . We tell them it 's safe , and now we can 't dismantle the core for two another weeks ! I will get the cleanup crew immediatelly . Let 's go , Denk . Come on ! This is Robert Denk . We broke an isotope seal in the core . I need a cleanup crew immediately . Clear a cleanup crew for tomorrow at 10 A.M. Ahh . Come on , Lisa ! Get your butt out here ! - Lisa ... - Get into my office . - Stay off of hardware . That 's my business ! - I 'll take responsibility . - You will not take responsibility ! - Thadius asked me to check those core seals ! We have equal status ! Damn it , Doctor ! ... Let me do what I do well . We won 't have any problems . You 're not doing very well today . Do not jeopardize the time I put in here ! Is that clear ? Don 't interfere with my work ! I 'm warning you ! - Don 't you threaten me ! Get out of my office ! Now ! - Fine . - What are you doing in my office ? - Uh , air-conditioning repair . Don 't worry about it . Good thing I was here . Your office would 've been a sauna by tomorrow morning . I 've got an air-conditioning repair for , uh , Dr. Specter . Yeah . Right . Yes , somebody 's already here . That 's impossible . They just called me 30 minutes ago and I just got here . We might have an illegal entry ! - Two minutes of your time , please . - What are you doing here ? - Security ! - No ! Listen to me ! The accelerator is going to be fired tonight ! Impossible . We 're dismantling it . I want you out of my office ! I know you 're not dismantling it , because a seal 's broken ! How do you know that ? That 's classified infiormation . Look , go chek the computer . Someone is delaying you on purpose . They sabotaged it so it can 't be dismantled , so they can fire it tonight . Please check the computer . If I am wrong , I will be happy to throw myself out of your office . - Please ! - O.k. REQUEST OPEN ACCELERATOR FILES ACCESS DENIED - I should have clearence for this ! - You see that ? They 're trying to keep the information hidden . FREDERICKS ACCESS DENIED There 's a file I don 't use anymore ... Mathematical theory , that 's should be still linked to the accelerator .

Attention , we have a security alert for all science divisions ! Please detain a worker with paperwork for Dr. Specter . - Guess who . I got to get out of here . - I can explain it to them . What are you going to say ... The day 's repeating ? Believe me , it won 't work . I 've tried it before . Just meet me at the front entrance at 6 : 00 . Don 't do anything , don 't talk to anybody . O 'k ? 6 : 00 . We 've got him ! Code 4 . Section " B. " Heading into the mainway ! Hold it ! Hey , you 're under arrest ! - Hey , stop ! - He 'll get away ! Hold it , Mister ! Hold it ! Hold it ! Right now ! Hold it ! Hold it ! Hey , Buddy ! He 's in a brown four-door . Call the main gate ! Yes ? It 's me . We may have a problem . Fredericks is working with someone . I don 't know ! I may need some help in this . Good . When you find them , you know what to do . All right . Stay there ! Stay there , Lisa ! Oh ... No ! Oh , my God ! I told you I 'm not crazy . Let 's go ! - Call the police ! - Don 't move ! - You all right ? - I don 't know . Oh , God ! - What did you do after I left your office ? - What ? - I copied the evidence against Denk . - Onto a disk ? - Yeah . - Have you got it ? No ! I left my briefcase ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Hold on ! Move it ! Back it up ! Get it out of there ! We 'd better call Washington or the police . Or somebody . - There 's no phone in there . - I 'm sorry ? My mom 's idea . The old man brings his mobile anyway . - What ? - You know ... There 's no phone , there 's no disk . What are we supposed to do , mail in a complaint ? We have time . We 'll think of something . Aw , it 's ... It 's beautiful . You know , the last time I was in the woods , I was 9 years old . I was burying my pet canary and I made a gravestone out of a paper plate . And I wrote on it ... " Fly to Heaven . " Hmm . I haven 't told anyone that in ... 20 years . Why do you remember ? What makes you different from the rest of us ? I don 't know . My memory 's not that great anyway , and ... I don 't know . Something happened to you , or you did something . What ... What did you do that first night ? Well , after you got shot ... I got drunk . Came home . I knocked a bunch of stuff over . I collapsed in bed . I woke up . It was the same day . - You 're missing something . - No , that 's it . My life isn 't that exciting . You drove through something unusual . You were near metal or chemical , or something , you 're hit by lightning ... Come on ! Use your mind ! O 'k . I collapsed in bed , my clock said 12 : 01 , and I got a shock . A shock ? My lamp was broken . There were loose wires . I tried to fix it , but - then I lit up like a christmas tree . - And then ? Then ... It was morning . There 's a theory ... Scott 's theory has a corrollary that says consciosness exists separate from the time bounce . You could 've gotten that bad shock when the first bounce happened . And that made you change in an energy level . It pushed you out of the loop just enough , so you can remember . I bet that 's it ! Lucky me . - Barry , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . - No , no . It 's ... - I mean , you saved my life . - Self-interest . I ... I 've been watching you out of my office for such a long time . The other day , I gathered up the nerve to actually speak to you . I made a fool out of myself . But I thought , hey , I 'll have another chance to speak to you someday , right ? - But then you ... Well ... - We spoke ? - Yeah . Yeah , we did . - How was I ? - Great . You were very nice . You threw me out of your office . - I 'm sorry . I guess I was having a bad day . That next morning when I saw you ... alive ... I realized I had a second chance ... A chance to save you . - I 'm sorry . - Hey , hey ! I 'm not going to let you die again . - Hi ! - Hi ! - You know , I 'm usually not this type of guy . - I 'm supposed to say that ! What time is it ? Oh , my God ! 12 : 00 ! - Now , we 've got to do something ! - There 's no time ! - Quick ! Tell me what your favorite color is ! - What ? - What 's your favorite color ? - Green . - Your favorite food ? - Smoked oysters . - Your favorite number ? - 37.1 . - Favorite music ? - That 's hard . No , just tell me ! - What is it ? - The Carpenters . The Carpenters ? You got to be kidding ! Lisa ... I love you ! The time is 7 : 35 AM . Please wake up . 9 : 17 LISA 'S IN CORRIDOR WITH DENK . LIGHTS CIGARETTE . 9 : 25 DENK GOES THROUGH LISA 'S OFFICE . 12 : 30 LUNCH WITH LISA . - Mom , I 'll call you back . The day 's repeating . 1 : 00 LISA 'S BEEPER GOES OFF . 1 : 40 ... You 're pathetic . That 's not how you throw the ball ! What 's wrong with you ? B 131 LISA FREDERICKS Well , look who decided to show up ! Don 't get your panties in a bunch . If you left us alone , the work could get done , but no ! You 're so invasive that no one can concentrate arround here . Stop assuming we 're all idiots and don 't judge people by how cute they are . Well ... - This is what I get for covering for you all these years . - Thank you . It might be time to look into your performance record . You do that . Well , nice knowing you , Barry . - Excuse me , Barry ? - Lisa ! I 'm a little confused . How do you know me ? O 'k . I know you like it compact without the crap , so here we go . I 'm going to tell you something that sounds impossible , but I 'll back up it with some facts . The time bounce has happened . We 've met before ... three times now . And you told me that your favorite food is oysters and your favorite number is 37.1 . And your favorite music is The Carpenters , even though I think you could do better . Now , Denk has been illegally firing the accelerator . You gonna find it out later this afternoon and you 'll transfer that proof onto a computer disk . Here 's where it gets a little sticky . I 've seen you shot , twice now because of that disk . But yesterday I was able to save you . But the time bounce happens and I wind up here , memory intact . I 'm the only one who remembers anything around here . I made you a time map . Sit back and watch the day unfold . It 's 9 : 15 now . 09 : 15 - DR. MOXLEY ENTERS - Lisa ? - Thadeus . - Barry Thomas ? - Yes , Doctor . I 've gotten your memos . You , too , Lisa ? Are we all losing assistants ? Actually , I ... Dr. Moxley , your two assistants are back on the computer . They 'll have their passes back by lunch time . Dr. Fredericks was so nice to explain the whole thing to me . - I appreciate that , Lisa . - Dr . Moxley , you look great on TV . 09 : 16 - JACKSON ENTERS ... I 'm Ann Jackson , Head of Personnel ... Ann , Dr. Moxley 's a very busy man . He doesn 't have time to listen to your suck up . It 's sad ! Dr. Moxley , if you ever have a problem , please , come to me personally , not to my low-level staff . Well , everything seems to be under control . Thank you , Lisa . I 'll see you at the 9 : 30 . - Good day ! - Good day ! Good day ! Howard ! Look . Over there . See that ? He 's about to light his cigarette . He 's met you in the hallway these past mornings . Today he can 't because you 're here with me . What we have to do , is to keep Denk from finding out about the computer disk . - Today I 'll take all the information . - I ... can 't just accept this .

Barry , I want you in my office immediately . Relax , Ann . I 'm quitting . O 'k ? Something I should 've done a long time ago . No , no , no , Barry . Dr. Moxley just called . You 're under arrest ! - Well , what for ? - For stealing classified computer information . - Come this way , please . - Hey , Howard ! - Maritial status . - Single . And occupation ? I don 't know . What time is it ? Just put down unemployed . Hey , Lisa is not murdered this time , right ? Social security number ? Really , you should learn type . We may be doing this for years . Well , I could always start again in six hours . - Hello ! How are you ? - Thomas . You made bail . - You guys got nothing in me ! It 's a bum beef . - Hey ! There are second chances ! - How did you get the bail ? - Don 't even ask why I 'm doing this . I don 't even know her . - You 're not killed today ! That 's great news ! - Barry , um ... Look , we ... You really like me a lot . You just can 't remember it . I 'd love to stick around , but that would be a lie . Barry , call me when your insanity clears up . Close the door . Get in . I don 't mean to be realistic about this or anything , but shouldn 't we call like a professional to take care of this ? - Howard , Howard ! - We 're not professionals ... We got to think of someting . He 's gonna fire that thing tonight . And we 'll get back to that hamster wheel . And you 'll gona ... - The police kept the computer disk . - O 'k ! Then call the police and they will take care of it ! It 's out of their jurisdiction , we have to tell Washington , and we don 't have any proof ! We neeed to get back in that building . Is there any way to get back in ? Yeah , I think so . Yeah . The accelerator needs a two-hour warm-up period before it can fire . That means he 'd start it , uh , in three hours . If we have security tape the lab through their surveillance cameras , we could get the proof we need to stop them . - Pay the bill . - What ? I don 't have any money , Barry ! - We had a lot more fun last night . - We did ? We took a walk in the woods and we sat by a fire . - We sat by a fire ? - Yeah . Are you saying me you .. that we ... and me ... I mean , did you get lucky ? - Oh , my God , you got lucky ! - You got lucky , too ! - It wasn 't just me . - This is so strange ! I know , but it was also temendous ! The Earth moved ! - Ohh ! - Want to step in the alley , please ? Let 's go . You , too . Move ! Over there . - These are the guys that have been killing you . - Where are the other disks ? - Who are you ? - Shut up ! - Why don 't you just leave ... Listen to the question ... Did you make any more disks ? - Excuse me , Sir . I 'm not really a part of this . - Shut up ! - There 's no reason to have me here . - Shut up ! There are no other disks . Sorry , Barry , you tell them I don 't have anything to do with this . With anything , o 'k ? Any information I have would be useless . I don 't know anything . Oh , my God ! Hurry up ! Help ! Check down there . I 'm sorry about your friend , Barry . I know you cared about him . That 's funny . He said the same thing to me when you were killed . Nothing ! - What ? - I didn 't leave the light on . Lisa ... - Thadius is in that house . - What ? I 'm sorry I wasn 't able to tell you this before , but six months ago , the Justice Department asked me to help them in an investigation of Thadius . Why are you investigating Thadius ? Because they suspected he 'd broken safety regulations trying to get accelerator up and runnung on budget . What are you talking about ? Lisa , he was the one , who broke those seals today to stop the dismantling ! - Moxley broke those seals ? - That 's right . And we don 't know what else he might do . We better talk to him . I don 't think so . I 'm afraid I 'm going to need you as material witnesses . - Shall we ? - O.k. - Thadius , what are you doing ? - I 'm sorry , Thadius . It 's over . - Thank God , Lisa , you 're all right ! - Thadius ! Now , Robert , you 're not going to fire that accelerator tonight ! That 's too dangerous ! What are you talking about ? It 's true , Robert . Your name is in the computers authorizing the firing sequence for tonight . That 's impossible ! Dr. Moxley , with all due respect , what are you doing in my house ? I 'm sorry , but I hoped to find another disk with the proof against him . He crashed the mainframe computer before I could retrieve anything . He 's lying . Who were you waiting for ? Who were those two men in the truck you were talking to ? Who are they ? - Hello , Ted ? It 's me . Where the hell are your men ? - Who are you talking to ? - Don 't move ! - I 'm just , uh , taking off my coat , o.k. ? Thank God you made the right choice . He set me up ! Don 't you understand ? The accelerator is going to be a $ 50 billion industry in five years ! He doesn 't care about you ! - Thadius , you said ... - I said what I had to . - Sometimes you do what 's wrong to do what 's right . I 'm sorry . - No ! - Oh ! I truly am sorry . The time is 7 : 35 AM . Please wake up . You bastard ! What kind of man are you ? I can 't believe it . You shot her ... And him ... And me in cold blood ! But that 's it , pal . You 're finished .

I 've got a report . - You , uh ... You better sit down . - Barry here has someting to tell you . - The time bounce has happened . - Excuse me ? - The time bounce . We 're in it . The Earth has stopped as we know it . Children don 't grow up , people don 't stay dead , We 'll never have another holiday and you 'll never see another flower bloom . What are you talking about ? And I 've fallen in love with a beautiful young lady , and , so far , I could only see her for a few hours , and it breaks my heart to meet her every morning a stranger . See , I want her every day . I want her to grow old with me . That 's why life is so precious ... Because time passes . Who is this ... ? Who 's this girl ? 37,1 Oysters . Green . The Carpenters ... " Fly to Heaven " . All right , look . We play the day as normal . When he goes to warm up the accelerator tonight , I 'll call for backup , you two will be out of it and it 'll be over . - If I wake up tomorrow and it 's today , I 'll kill myself . - Look who decided to show up ! I am Robert Denk and this is Dr. Fredericks . Oh , yes . Of course I knew that . What a pleasure it is ... We need more men like Barry . He 's an excellent worker and we would like to treat him accordingly . Sorry ? Barry , I 'd like that evaluation report of Miss Jackson on my desk by noon . - Sure thing . - Evaluation ? We are like this ! - Hey ! - Howard , you 're alive ! - I wasn 't in the bathroom that long , was I ? - Ohh ! Sorry , sorry ! - Careful , guys ! - Oh ! - Ohh ! Oh , Jack , I 'm so sorry ! This is a terrible embarrassement for me . We told them it 's safe , and now we can 't dismantle the core for two weeks . No one was hurt . The radiation 's contained in the core . I think people understand . Better double-check on those seals . Thank you , Lisa . Thadius , I take full responsibility . I 'll get a cleanup crew and I 'll deal with the press immediately .

 Do you remember many years ago Father took me aside and told me I was preoccupied with the insignificant morbidly preoccupied , in his opinion . Well , for years now , I 've led a life that even he must call normal . Except for the fact that in my odd , spare moments ... I write . It may be a disappointment to him , but I ask is it a crime ? Kafka ? The Keeper of the Files needs your summation of the Erlarger claim . I gave it to him yesterday . - You didn 't give it to me . - I gave it to him . In an organization as efficient as ours When a document , once in a great while , gets lost it may never be found . It seemed easier , as I was passing by . But I 'm the messenger ! An error like this damages my credibility . Burgel , your credibility is unparalleled . When I deliver a message , the act of delivering it , you might say has an official stamp . I 'll write that down . Your position in this firm is not unassailable . Good morning , Miss Rossman . Or should I say , afternoon ? - Say what you like . Nobody listens . - Don 't they ? You underestimate my station in this office and overrate yours . Not now , Burgel . It is I who gives advice here , not you . By telling the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it 's not my position which is compromised , if that 's what you 're implying . You 're just doing your job . It 's what I 'm paid to do . Sweet ? You 're pathetic . And you 're late . Write that down in your little book . I work in the section next to you . I know . I understand you 're a friend of Eduard Raban . Am i ? He mentioned that he knew you and One of you must be mistaken . I 'm sorry , but I 'm sure that I saw you together There are people watching ! Don 't make me embarrass you . You have ink on your nose . I 'll expect your written resignation immediately . Ah ! Away from your section without cause . I knew it would happen one day . Kafka ? Yes , sir . Then it 's Kafka . Oh , yes . I 'm looking for Mr. Raban , from upstairs . I can 't hear you . Mr. Raban Do you know where he is ? You didn 't need to come out of bed . I could have taken the key . Yes , I 'm sure you could . Should you be looking at that ? It 's my house , isn 't it ? - Well , yes , but - Out He 's not here , so out ! Come on . Have you seen Eduard Raban ? No . Has anyone here seen Eduard ? Have you seen Eduard tonight ? Eduard Raban ? Last week he told those jokes you loved Oh ? Doesn 't sound like me . Didn 't he run away with those actors ? - You coming to the cabaret ? - No , I have to work . Don 't you ever sleep ? Yes , that was him . - Leaving ? - I 'm looking for Eduard . You seen him ? - Who ? - Eduard Wait here . We 're just picking up Julius . You know Anna , don 't you ? How long have you been here ? I just got here . No , how long have you been here ? A few days . I went to your parents ' house . - You saw Father ? - I didn 't go to see him . But I wrote you I 'd moved out . You wrote you wanted to moved out . Repeatedly and at great length . I 'm living in town now because of my work . You can save on postage . Anyway , you know where to find me . He 's coming over . I went to Eduard 's apartment . - Eduard 's apartment . - He 's not there . He hasn 't been seen there . I mean , not for a day or two . Not by the landlady , in any case . Thank you . I 'll try again then . - How much have you told him ? - He knows only a clerk nothing . - Eduard said he 's a writer . - That may be useful . That may be dangerous . It 's not your bike , Frederic ! Kafka ! Will we see you at the cabaret ? You won 't get in now . Another excuse to go , Homer What are you working on ? I think about a man who wakes up himself transformed Oh ! Drinking The most thing is castle with majestic Only , as distance Oh ! Have we met ? Bizzlebek is the name - The gravedigger . - Stonecutter , really . Sorry . Sculptor , if I had any freedom in the matter . But one should be called artist only if he 's paid for it . and perhaps not even then . Yours is a noisy line of work . Well , it 's external noise . Whereas you the reverberations are inside . I 've read your stories . They 're quite fantastic . I can 't imagine what you read . Just what you 've published . In magazines nobody reads . They should be filed in the Castle with all other useless paper . Nonetheless , some of us are interested in your case . That one story , for instance , about the penal colony . The needles inscribing the judgment into the flesh of the condemned man . It 's new . I need to find a clever device to make my work more noticeable . I 'm off to the cabaret . After a day at the Castle cemetery . I have a strong urge to see figures in motion before going to bed . Good night , Kafka . Good night , Mr. Bizzlebek . The terrible toil of the insurance office continues as ever . I am continually harassed by petty tyrants . as I issue pointless reports . My friend Eduard has disappeared . You never met him because I never dared bring a friend home . Not with Father lording over us all from his armchair . Now I gather Anna has paid you a visit . My relations with her have been difficult , to say the least . I can only hope Father didn 't frighten her away any further . Your son ... Your loving son Your occasionally loving son Your incapable-of-loving son Your absolutely-bored-to-death - with-any-sort-of-family-life son . You know him ? Yes . His name is Eduard Raban ? Yes . Inspector Grubach . Kafka . Kafka , Kafka ... Is that your real name ? Yes . Why Shouldn 't it be ? When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban ? Wednesday . - At work ? - Yes . Did you go anywhere afterward ? To have a drink , perhaps ? No , We said good-bye outside the office , and he went to his house . - You work for workers . - Accident Insurance . - Where you 've been employed seven years . - Eight . And seven months . Would you describe your relationship with Raban ? as close ? No . No ? Yes . Yes , no , yes , no what ? I worked in the same office with him for three years . He was found in the river . Could he swim ? Do you think ? You think he drowned himself ? Grown men don 't normally fall into the river , do they ? No . He may have had a few drinks , despite what you think . Can I ask how you found me ? Of course . His landlady told us you 'd been there and that you took a great interest in looking through his things . Well , uh , he was a very close f ... He didn 't have any other fr ... He had no family . We know that . Is that all ? No . We know other things , too . Kafka . I don 't usually get involved with people in the Old Quarter but the river runs its own course . I 'd like you to know that in me you have , not a friend , of course because we are strangers from incompatible social classes but to some extent , shall we say an interested third party . I 'll bear that in mind . Yes , Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant . Yes . Inspector GRUBACH You asked to see me ? Sit down , Kafka . You 've been here for nearly 9 years . You 've done your work diligently . There are no complaints on that score . But there 's more to the job than the work . There are other people to consider . And frankly , Kafka ... We feel your social activities leave a lot to be desired . My social activities ? You 're a lone wolf . You keep too much to yourself . It makes me uneasy . and if it makes me uneasy , I can 't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees . But in order to finish my work , I have little time You must make the time . Have you never wondered Why other clerks have advanced to higher positions , while you who 've been here longer , have not ? No , sir . It doesn 't matter how well you do your work . You clearly view it as something to get through not something to take an active interest in . I know you were friendly with that poor fellow . What was his name ? Eduard Raban ? Yes , Raban . But he was too like you . Even more like you perhaps than you are yourself . In any case , don 't ask me why word has come down you are to receive the promotion intended for him . You will be given two assistants and a commensurate rise in salary . That 's all . Thank you . I understand you fancy yourself as a writer . In a small way . You should find a more athletic hobby . Put some color in your cheeks . My assistants , I presume . I 'm Kafka . Ludwig . Oscar . You 're brothers ? - Twins . - Actually . - Have you worked here long ? - Why ? - No . - Yes . - Actually . - Long . Well , let 's start moving in . Are you free for lunch ? Eduard . That 's That 's a very difficult subject . He wasn 't capable of suicide . He was obsessed by the idea of it . I was surprised by the Surprised by the timing , but I wasn 't surprised by the act . Perhaps he had two faces . One for you and one for me . - He wasn 't like that . - Are you sure ? I knew him very well . Then you knew we were having an affair . Oh , yes . Eduard and I led very different lives outside the office . We knew there might be consequences . What sort of consequences ? Look what happened . We don 't know he wasn 't robbed . The police identified him by his wallet . And you believe everything so is tell you ? When I have no reason to doubt . They 're authorities . That 's reason enough . The police may have killed him . Why would they do that ? Will you meet me tonight ? Tonight ? Where ? The Musil District . Right . Does that mean yes ? Oh , yes . Tonight . Weren 't you almost married recently ? Oh , yes . Uh ... Last year I was engaged , twice ... to the same woman . I 'm not really ... I broke it off . Eduard wanted to get married . And you ? I 'm suspicious of men who want to marry . What time ? Whereabouts in the Musil District ? Go to the Esplanade . Nine o 'clock . you 'll find your way from there . Enjoy . It 's another bombing ! I think it 's dangerous ... He might be able to help ... It 's too risky ... Please sit down , Kafka . I doubt Eduard told you about us and our ... Activities . Why bring me into it ? My question exactly . Have you seen any of our literature ? I can 't say I have . Our present distribution is not effective . The issue at hand is quality . We thought you might be able to help us . I wright by myself ... for myself . You see ? This work can change the way things are . It 's not work I can do ... even if I were sympathetic to your ... cause . It 's not work I can do for hire . They may start proceedings against you . What kind of proceedings ? - An investigation which is the trial . - And the sentencing . Eduard found out what those are like . The day he died , Eduard was called to the castle . Did you hnow that ? What of it ? He was summonded to correct ... a discrepancy in Medical Records . And he was never seen alive again . What does that prove ? That he was murdered ? He was murdered ! A pass into the Castle was an opportunity we couldn 't ignore . He set off that evening , carrying one of our custom-made " briefcases " With a message ... for the Castle . The Thought of Eduard delivering a bomb shocks you ? you needn 't accept everything as true . You need only accept it as necessary . The bomb didn 't go off , so he must have been caught and executed . It has happened before . Must have been ? Did any of you ... Those file clerks at the Castle will deny everything . No doubt he was handed over to the police , discreetly . We 've had no repercussions as yet . Eduard must not have talked You 're the one they contacted . So that 's who the enemy is policemen and file clerks . Law and order , you might say . You think what we 're doing is wrong ? What would you suggest then ? Did any of you actually go up to the Castle with Eduard ? Did you ? You sit around twisting the facts to suit your ... inbred theories . In my experience , the truth is not that convenient . See ? He thinks only of himself . It 's why he came here tonight . That 's true . It 's also why I 'm leaving . I can 't swim ! Hi ! How was your evening ? - Fine . - Terrible . What happened ? - Whenever we go to a nightclub ... - I want to go to another one . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . You look very tired . Miss Rossman came to see you . Gabriela . Do you know her ? Do you ? We saw her naked once . All you think about is women ! She went to the roof to sunbathe once And we watched her change . - We worked in Supplies carrying boxes - Boxes of medicine - We dropped them a lot . - He dropped them . It 's not too bad working here , though . You 've never felt it was a horrible double life from which there was probably no escape but insanity ? - Yes - No I envy you - You should be content , y 'know - You should ! You are looking for Gabriela Rossman ? Yes Please Who 's been open Shall I reseal it ? There 's not a lot of point . I got your note Burgel gave it to me . I didn 't leave it with Burgel . What are you doing ? Getting Eduard 's things , so no one else does . Things of value or things which connect you two ? Both . I thought you might like to do the same . Yours ? Probably not worth keeping . Some of those letters may be mine . Dame it ! Are you all right ? Why were you fired ? They don 't need reasons . To fire me , to kill Eduard . They ? Who is " they " ? They ! the authorities , the police ! The Castle , Burgel ! Burgel ? I don 't see Burgel as a " they " He 's more of an " it " It 's the small ones you have to look out for . The small men with small ideas . Don 't open that . Why not ? Why not ? Opening and closing the latch activates it . You said Eduard was murdered while he was carrying the bomb . If this the bomb ... How many bombs are there ? - You still think it was suicide . - What ? Less trouble for the police . Less disturbing for you . - I just want to know . - Then open it ! Don 't think they 're not watching . To them , we 're all connected . The group , Eduard , me , you . Gabriela . if I waited for you to understand , it 'd be too late . I looked in the street She wasn 't there . She disappeared between leaving the room and coming outside . - Did you go to her house ? - Did I what ? Did you go to her house ? No , I didn 't go to her house . I see . Why would someone want to kidnap this woman ? Her name is , uh ... Roseman ? Rossman . Why ? You asked me to tell you if anything relevant came up . Miss Rossman is relevant . When we talked before , I didn 't know she was ... friendly with Mr. Raban . She was friendly with many people . She was friendly with you . That has been noted . But where does it lead us ? Unless you have something more to add . She 's missing ! Isn 't that enough for you ? Yes , that 's enough . She lost her job today . I 'd probably go away and brood a bit myself . Is that yours ? Yes . maybe she was right in what she said . What did she say ? That perhaps the police have allegiance to something other than the truth . She never believed Eduard 's death was suicide . And for the record , neither do i . It doesn 't rhyme . You can 't use it in that context . You must move through it . Come sit with us . No , I 'm looking for some people . Insect people . You may be onto something . What ? Meeting women . You 've discovered a way in and out . You enter dramatically , spilling over with concern for a lost friend . That appeals to their caring nature . If things go poorly , you leave , citing the need to look elsewhere as your motive . It 's perfect . Yes , it would be perfect ... if that were my intent . What other intent is there ? - Gabriela disapperared . - We know . Why did you call the police ? - What did you tell them ? - That I was concerned for her safety . Be concerned for us . - What about her ? - Any of us might be next . - You might be next . - Not me . - We intend to stay together . - Very close . - They find you alone and strike - Stay with us - Listen . We found the bomb . - What ? In Eduard 's apartment . Unopened . Obviously unopened ! If it were opened , it wouldn 't last very long , right ? - You gave it to the police . - No , it 's in my apartment . Where it does no one any good . Or any harm . Eduard , Gabriela , Kafka . All from the same office . It might be a cover-up . Of incredible proportions . It could be embezzlement . It 's always about money . Clearly , there 's no shortage of theories . What 's needed are facts . We need to know more about why Eduard was summoned to the Castle . Excuse me . I understand you have Eduard Raban 's file . I do . Might I look at it for an address for his family ? I 'd like to write to them . No entry for family . Was there something else ? No . It 's just that I feel a sense of obligation . He was a very dear friend If there 's some way that I could help in closing up his affairs . There 's but one report to complete . I will do that myself and submit it to the Castle tomorrow . I see . There 's just the Erlanger claim . The Orlac chaim . Well , thank you , sir . You 're too sensitive . Yes , sir . Let the poor fellow rest in peace . If you wanted accounts , why did you ask for employees ? Orlac is an account ? It 's a factory in the northern mountains . An excellent customer . Without a proper request , I am not obliged to do this . But I will make an exception on this one occasion . At least the file is current , even if the employee isn 't . That place has so many accidents it 's a good thing the peasants there have no trouble with procreating . All these in the last year ? Terrible accidents up there . Cave-ins primarily . They can 't even recover the bodies . Awful way to die . yes . That 's bad enough , but even the district medical Officer was killed . His picture is missing I must make a note of that . - Was that Dr. Murnau ? - Yes . Dr. Murnau was a brave man A true visionary . He spent his life in those backwaters , unconcerned for personal gain . A great loss . And this list is the clerks who worked on Orlac claims ? Yes . Is your friend 's name there ? No . Then he only worked on one case . His name will appear when your Chief sends me the final summation . When a file has been sent to the Castle can it be recalled for review ? Of course not ! only by a Director of the firm . Who would want to let in riff-raff from the streets ? But why keep records if they can 't be inspected ? We 've had these laws for centuries . How can you doubt them ? Maybe I should apply to our Directors . You do not summon them , They summon you . And this hardly ever happens , if at all . Where do the files go , when they go to the Castle ? We 're a medical insurance firm . They go to the Medical Records Division . Perhaps I should see the head of Medical Records . It so happens , my dear simple sir ... The head of Medical Records at the Castle is one of the Directors of this firm . Please ! - I 'm trying to finish my work . - You 've actually started some ? He 's done nothing all day . He 's afraid I 'll show him up . Assistants ! I may as well have two people who fell from the sky . It 's not our fault . We 're nervous . And upset . What is it now ? - Everything I say , he disagrees with . - Everything . We 've been together so long our personalities overflow into one another . - And vice-versa . - It 's horrible . Imagine that happening to you . Horrible . Why don 't you both take your lunch ? Go on ! The Chief Clerk wants this tomorrow . He said it should only take you an extra hour ... or two . Come on ! There 's no one up there . We 're going now . That 's it . It 's all right . You 've done very well . Never mind them . They 'll be attended to . Watch your step . Excellent job . This won 't go unrecognized . And I 'm sure you 'll be well rewarded . Almost there . One final task . You 'll like this gentleman . Returning to your safe little burrow ? No matter how deep you dig - you leave a trail - we can follow . We 're taking you to the Castle . So it was you . We thought it was Burgel . He wouldn 't be let near the Castle . You should view this as a great favor . - We answer to the highest authority . - Very high . We deal with the person in charge . Who is that ? - We don 't know . - We 're not allowed to say . Shall we ? For all your incompetence , I thought you were loyal to me . You 're good actors . - Yes ! - Thank you ! - When we get to the Castle don 't make a fuss . It would spoil the favorable impression You dirty pig ! You 've created otherwise . Why did you bother pursuing this at all ? I thought it was pursuing me . It 's always about you , isn 't it , Kafka ? Every time I see those two escorting someone the next time I see that person is in my cemetary . Isn 't that a coincidence ? I 'd like to go to the Castle , but I think it 's best to go alone . There are less conspicuous ways to enter the Castle . Wouldn 't you rather go through official channels ? They get me nowhere They go around in circles . I 'm flattered , of course , to be taken into your confidence even without knowing all the details . Even though I 'm sure they 're very interesting . To see such determination is reward enough for me . Have you ever been inside the Castle ? No . I was restoring some stones up here the other day when I found this . Hold on . An empty tomb ? The Castle gates were locked during the Great Plague . It 's an escape route . Don 't get stuck . Good luck - You said you admired my work . - Yes . Would you do me a favor ? Another one ? If I don 't see you later , would you go to my house , find my notebooks ... and destroy them ? All my manuscripts ... none of them are finished . Just burn them , all right ? What an extraordinary request . A true friend would do it . Not necessarily ! A wife would ! Are you lost ? I 'm looking for Medical Records . That 's the yellow floor . Of course . Have I seen you here before ? No I 'm new . Grab him ! Get his papers . I 'm talking to you ! His papers ! How many more of these tonight ? Three , I think . We 've been waiting . Getting him here wasn 't easy . Help us get him prepared . All a bit much , don 't you think ? Uh , yes . It 's the noise that gets to me . And the smell . Yes . Quite . You don 't belong here , do you ? Actually , no . I was on my way to the Medical Records Division . I was just going that way myself . You pig ! Let me go ! Now , Miss Rossman , I want to chat with you . Miss Rossman ? Do something . How do you feel , Miss Rossman ? - I know you . - Better . When it all comes down you 'll be the first to die . And you . We aren 't making much progress today . You 'll hang by the guts of the police . - You 're incompetent . - Let me try this . - What are you doing ? - Something 's wrong . What were they doing there ? Just between you and me ... I 'm supervisor . On salary like anyone else . They 're trying to come up with , shall I say a more efficient person . I don 't follow . What makes someone more prone to anger or happiness or certain colors ? The chemical balance can be altered . But in what ways ? In what measure ? It 's an impure science . I 've seen some of their impurities . Haven 't we all ? They do what they 're told . That makes them " efficient " ? First physiology , then ideology . Are you sure this is the right way ? I must see the head of Medical Records . - He did summon you then ? - Yes . Interesting . There was another clerk from the claims office ... a bit like you ... summoned but never arrived . No ? Why not ? They killed him , actually . Why ? From what I heard , it was bookkeeping . Bookkeeping ? You see , he was accidentally sent the wrong piece of paper Piece of paper ? How could that matter ? It authorized compensation for a death that hadn 't yet occurred . Orlac . Yes , Kafka . Workers have wives and children . Unfortunately , it 's the only way to ensure future workers . We find it best when an insurance company like yours gives them a small cash payment when they lose their husbands . People want industry , progress . we give it to them . That 's body-snatching , not progress . I think they called it the " resurrection " business . I even resurrected myself , didn 't I ? Dr. Murnau . The heroic martyr of Orlac . We had to move on from there , find subjects elsewhere . People who are less likely to object . Like Gabriela Rossman ? Or people who are already guilty of something . Why do you involve yourself with anarchists ? I would have preferred to see one of your manuscripts . I mean it . Your work has been an inspiration to me , what I 've seen of it . Why don 't you publish more often . Is it a certain laziness with regard to composition ? Or are you just one of those writers with , how shall I say No use for an audience ? Thank you . You despise someone like me because you despise the modern . But ... you 're at the forefront of what is modern . You write about it . Document it . Unlike you , though I have chosen to embrace it . That 's our biggest headache . Understanding the human mind . You must admit we have that in common . You and I have nothing in common . I 've tried to write nightmares , and you 've built one . You have your tools , I have mine . But we are men of vision , you and I. That 's what sets us apart from the great faceless mass . Faceless ? There 's a face ! What will you say when the great faceless mass comes calling on its own initiative ? What will you say to them ? A crowd is easier to control than an individual . A crowd has a common purpose . The purpose of the individual is always in question . That 's what you 're trying to eliminate . That which makes one human being different from another . But you 'll never never reach a man 's soul through a lens . That depends on which end of the microscope you 're on . Stop him ! Stop him ! Boys ! Get my feet , quickly ! Get my feet ! Get my feet ! My feet ! You idiots ! Get up and stop this ! Where were you ? - Behind you . Did you get him ? - No , but I will . He 's gone . You had told us Miss Rossman had disappeared . - Well , she has been found . - Yes . We are recommending for the report a verdict of suicide . What would be your opinion ? Suicide . I 'd have to agree . She was perhaps despondent over the loss of her beloved Mr. Raban . That would account for it . You are You 're very helpful , Kafka . You 're early , for once . The Chief Clerk wants to see you in his office . You wanted to see me ? You should know , I received two communications . The first summoning you to the Castle the second countermanding the first . Did they say why , sir ? My superiors have no obligation to explain their directives to me . And certainly not to you . I see , sir . I just thought today might be different . Why should today be different ? Dearest Father . I had always believed that it is better to know the truth than to live in ignorance . Now I shall find out if I was right . I can no longer deny that I am part of the world around me . Nor can I deny despite our differences that I remain your son . And so I hope only that these late perhaps insignificant realizations might reassure us both a little and make our living and our dying easier

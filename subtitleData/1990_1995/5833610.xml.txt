 Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Sir , look ! - Hey , stop ! - Who the hell are they ? And how did they get here ? What the hell are they doing ? Hyah ! They 're trying to kill each other . - He 'll kill him ! - Stand by to fire ! Fire ! Hyah ! Quick ! More powder ! Come on . What are you waiting for ? - Can 't see a thing ! - Come on . This way . Is he dead ? - He 's still alive . - Make a stretcher . Aye , sir ! Who are you ? What 's your name ? I 'm Doctor ... Victor ... Frankenstein . Lie still . Your shoulder 's out of joint . Aah ! - Get him some whiskey . - What is this place ? My ship , in the sea of barents , frozen in all winter . What were you doing ? You 're 100 miles from land . Lucky the ice didn 't crack under you . - Where are you from ? - Archangel . Archangel . That 's 1,000 miles . That man , the one with the wolves , why was he trying to kill you ? Give him some food . No . Wait . Do you have cannon on board ? 20-pounders . Why ? Get them ready . He 'll be back . Ship 's guns against a man ? He 's not a man . He could tear this ship to pieces with his hands . Captain , please . Listen to me . You 're in terrible danger . He 'll attack at dawn . He 'll send wolves first . Then he 'll kill everyone on board without a thought . - How many guns do you have ? - Mad , Skipper . - Get the food . - Aye , sir . Is your crew armed ? They must be armed . They must be ready . What did you mean , he 's not a man ? Captain , please listen to me before it 's too late . What did you mean , he 's not a man ? Who is he ? Well , come on . Speak . Who is he ? The devil . Hey ! Keep awake ! You 're supposed to be on lookout . - Sorry , Bosun . - Take food to the captain . What 's the matter , Bosun ? Afraid he 'll something he shouldn 't ? Do you have something to say , Zorkin ? Why didn 't you tell us about the town ? There 's nothing out there for 1,000 miles . - You 've seen the chart . - Where 'd those sleds come from ? 'Course there 's a bloody town . There 's nothing between here and Archangel . Now , get below . Sir ! He 's still there ! That man ! He 's lit a fire ! Get the food . [ Animal Whimpers ] [ Frankenstein ] For God 's sake , Captain ... - your lives are in danger . - From what ? You listen to me . What is this about ? Who are you ? And where have you come from ? I 'm a scientist from Ingolstadt . A scientist ? What the hell are you doing out here ? Last year ... I made a discovery , and I wish with all my soul that I had not . - What kind of discovery ? - Something so dangerous that it could destroy every living thing on board this ship . - Order ! - [ Gavel Banging ] Order ! Order , please ! Order ! Order ! Members of the University , it now falls to me to reveal the years 's most closesly guarded secret . Professor Kloiber 's brilliant works of theology have spread his fame across europe . [ Applause ] Dr. Abendroth 's thesis on the falsity of turning lead into gold has brought the Art of Metallurgy to the status of a true science . And finally , Dr. Frankenstein 's work on the human body . Quiet , please ! Quiet ! Quiet ! Order ! The king 's prize for the advancement of science goes to the recigious work of Professor Kloiber , whose piety and dedication throught his subject ... [ Crowd Grumbling ] Oh , no ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Order ! Order ! Order , please ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Order ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! Frankenstein ! - On your shoulders ! - Order ! Frankenstein ! Stop this ! Put me down ! - Frankenstein ! - Put me- - put me down ! Order ! Frank-en-stein ! Frank-en-stein ! - Frankenstein ! - Put me down ! Frank-en-stein ! Frank-en-stein ! Give the science prize to a bible bore ! - This is no university ! - It 's obscene ! - Yeah ! - Will you listen to me ? Demonstrations like this do no good . They will only use this to discredit everything I have taught you . - Then they 're afraid of science ! - Yes , and it is your job to build a future for science , to take what I 've given you and to use it , not to cause a riot . [ Coughing ] Now- - now go back inside and take up your books . [ Coughing ] Hey , come away . It 's cholera . Keep giving her this solution . Sister , try and get her into some fresh air . The monsignor has forbidden it . Then the monsignor should be hanged . Do as I say . How is she , Sister ? Sir . - Victor ? - Clerval , what are you doing here ? Your father wants me to bring you home . - What ? - He thinks your life 's in danger . So does Elizabeth . Come outside . Come on . Clerval , please make them understand . I 'm a doctor . Please are dying . How can I leave ? There 's no cure for this disease . No . You 're wrong . Cholera can be cured with a saline solution . One day I 'll prove it . These people aren 't dying of disease . They 're dying of ignorance . I 'll write when I can . - How 's Elizabeth ? - She sent you this . She might appreciate an answer . You haven 't answered her letters for months . Look around you ! There 's so much to do here ! Sometimes I don 't know if it 's day or night ! What 's wrong ? [ Muffled Cough ] Clerval , remember those days when he spoke of ambition ? We swore to reach the heights- - me with my science and you with your art . That was long ago , Victor . Yes , but I haven 't forgotten , and I 'm on the threshold now , - on the very brink . - What do you mean ? Come with me . Mind the steps . I 'll turn up the lamps . - Is this all yours ? - Mm-hmm . Come and meet my friends . - Good God ! - He 's perfectly harmless . - You can hold him . - Where did you get it ? - [ Squealing ] - I- - I made it . Have a look at this one . Imagine a fox trying to catch this fellow . [ Screeching ] You made these things ? How ? I 'll show you . - In here . - What is it ? What would you like it to me ? A cat , a mouse , a bird , a tiger ? I don 't understand . Every living creature is composed of elements , Clerval- - hydrogen , oxygen , iron , and many , many more . Well , there they all are , all the elements of life . - In this liquid ? - They are the liquid . It took me five years to get that right . And these ... these are my electrophori . They are the world 's latest invention . Magnificent , aren 't they ? Do you know what a magnetic field is ? - Watch this . - What are you doing ? - Hand me that copper rod . - This one ? Mm-mm . Now stand back . - [ Buzzing ] - What 's that noise ? Don 't talk . I have to concentrate . There ! In the tank . See ! What is it ? It 's my hand , and it 's alive . See ! Ugh ... - Sorcery . - Science , my friend . Pure science . - It 's a trick . - A trick ? Well , if that confounds you , what would you say if I could create a whole body ? What do you mean ? What if I could make a living man , Clerval ? Stronger than you or I , bigger , more intelligent , perfect in every way , a new kind of man , immune to all diseases , more powerful than any man of Earth . Would that be a trick , too ? Or would it be this world 's greatest gift ? What are you saying ? I 've discovered the secret of life , Clerval . Here , in this very room . - And I control it . - Blashphemy ! Oh , my poor dear poet . You still believe all that- - Adam and Eve , the Garden of Eden , good and evil ! Myths and legends , Clerval ! And science is the future . - Don 't you see ? - No , I don 't see . You aren 't God , you can 't create like God . But you 've just seen it . Look outside in the streets- the misery the sickness . - You are not God ! - I can cure ... - Are you ill ? It 'll pass . I 'll see you tomorrow . - I can 't leave you . - Please , I 'm all right . You 're a sick man . I can 't leave now ! Just go ! Go ! Aah ! [ Coughs ] [ Coughing ] [ Coughing ] [ Coughing ] Help me ! Help me ! You can 't afford to get married at your age . - I 'm 17 . - If I had my time over again ... What 's wrong ? God Almighty . Fetch the magistrate . Get away . Get away from me . Get away ! [ Whimpering ] The priest said he 'd never seen anyone in such a state . - Where did they find him ? - In the gutter . In here , Monsieur . Please understand me , Monsieur Clerval . The doctor is a fine man , but I have other lodgers . I can 't have sickness in the house , not this sickness . I want him out by lunchtime . - Did you call a doctor ? - He won 't hear of it . Beware , Monsieur . There 's death in this room . - Huh ? - I 'll get a doctor . No , Clerval . No doctor . You 're sick . You need help . - They don 't know how to treat it . - That 's because they can 't . I want him out by lunchtime . You hear me ? Lunchtime . - It 's Cholera , isn 't it ? - Yes . - Quick ! - He 's there ! You ! What are you doing here ? Uhh ... Get him ! Get him ! Bring him down ! Aah ! Aah ! Tell me what this is in case I need more . Oh , it 's saline solution ... 40 % . [ Coughs ] - Will it cure you ? - In time . You need proper care . I need to get you home . - Are you well enough ot travel ? - Aah ! What is it ? What 's wrong ? Get out of the way ! Aah ! - Ahh ... - [ Gasping ] My carriage is at the inn . I 'll be gone five minutes . Will you be all right ? [ Yelling ] Come on now ! Come on ! Over there ! Come on ! Faster ! We 've got him now ! Aah ! Aah ! - Who the hell was he ? - God knows , he 's dead now . How do we get down there ? We don 't . Leave him to the vultures . Ugh ... That was his first encounter with the human race ... like a child , no one to guide him ... no one to help ... and the guilt was mine , all mine . If only I 'd been able to prepare him , I might have saved so many precious lives , and this ship would not be in such terrible danger . Why should I believe this ? Captain , look at me . I 've chased him over half this world . I 've lost everything except my life . Do not doubt me . he will destroy this ship and every member of your crew . So why is he waiting ? For the dawn . We hate the darkness . - We ? - We are one , Captain ... he and I. I made him . Like I made the hand . From me . We are two parts of a single man . Oh , I didn 't understand that either at first . When Clerval took me home to Switzerland , I didn 't know he 'd survived . He was unformed you see . Unfinished . I thought he 'd surely perish in the hills or in the forests ... But he was what I had made him- - a creature more powerful than any man of Earth . - [ Coughing ] - Here . Time for this again . - How far now ? - Only a few hours , and then Elizabeth will take over . Thank goodness for that . It 's always nice to be appreciated . - When are you going to marry her ? - Will she have me ? Not looking like this . Hey ! Slow down ! There 's a sick man in here ! Sorry , Sir . Steady ! What is it , boy ? Hey ! You ! Get off my land . Get him ! Go on , boy ! Mother of God . Mary , come here ! Mary ! [ Harpsichord Plays ] Bravo , Elizabeth . Beautifully played ! I wish I could play like that . Elizabeth , do stop worrying . Clerval won 't let us down . Justine , he 's been gone five days . He could have has trouble with the horses or something equally trivial . Father , come quickly ! Outside ! Now ! - William , what 's the matter ? - You won 't believe it . - What ? - Coming up the drive . - Who ? - Victor ! He 's home ! Victor ! Victor ! Victor ! I 'll ride in with you . Master William , keep your distance ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Take my horse . Victor- - oh , my love . You 're ill . Little brother , you 've grown . - Let me help you . - William , get some blankets . Oh , hello , my dear Justine . Sick thought I was , that homecoming was the happiest of my life . Through all those long and fevered weeks , my cousin Elizabeth never left my side . We had grown up together , she and I , ever since she came to live with us after her parents died . I 'd loved her even as a child , and now I finally found my courage . Victor , who nurses the sick at Ingolstadt ? The nuns . Why ? I 'd like to help them , like I helped you . Would they let me ? It 's not ladies ' work . The risks are high . - You take them . - I 'm not a lady . Victor , I 'm serious . It 's what I 'm trained for . Then why can 't I be trained , like the nuns ? Ah . I see I 've won . Winner takes all , I think . - Loser makes a speech ? - A speech ? Short one . Just ... four words . - Not don 't mention it again . - No . Will ... you ... marry ... me ? Yes ! Yes . Yes . [ Gasps ] Aah ! Amy , swim ! Swim , Amy , swim ! Where is she ? She can 't swim ! Help ! Amy ! Where are you taking her ? - Amy ? - Amy , are you all right ? Amy ! Aaa ... mee ... aaa ... mee ... - Victor , what happened ? - I don 't know . - What was it ? - I don 't know . I ... I was just dizzy . You 're nice-cold . I 'll get you a blanket . It was as if a knife had entered my heart , something so powerful that it froze my very soul . [ Coughing ] [ Moaning ] No . Please , please ... no ! Help him . Help him ! - Aah ! - Somebody , please , help him ! - Help him ! - Oh ! Help him ! Help him ! Wh-who is it ? Who 's there ? Oh ... Who are you ? What 's happened ? Dying ! He 's dying ! Victor . Victor . - He 's dying ! - Victor , wake up . Victor , you 're having a nightmare . - Who 's dying ? - Go back to bed . - He was shouting . - Go back to bed . Sorry . I was dreaming . About dying ? - William . - Yes , Father . - Good night . - I 'm sorry I woke you , Father . - Victor , may I saw something ? - Of course . You have a brilliant mind ... but you 're too willing to risk your future . - In what way ? - By ... by exposing yourself to disease . Why , you 've made yourself sick , my son , in the service of others . Your compassion is commendable ... but don 't risk your life again . You have no much to offer this world . Well ... Good night . Good night , Father . [ Rooster Crowing ] - Aah ! - Now , listen . Listen . There 's a bullet in there , and I 've got to get it out . It 's going to hurt bad , but I 've got to do it , understand ? Uh-huh . - Is it always painful ? - What ? - Shaving ? - No . - Falling in love . - What gives you that idea ? Nothing . I think Clerval 's in love with Justine , - like you and Elizabeth . - Do you , now ? He wants me to take this not to her . I think it 's a love letter . Poor Cherval . Expect he 'll get nightmares soon , like you . William , falling in love doesn 't give you nightmares . Now , have you thought any more about being my best man ? - Yes , I can 't . - Why ever not ? I don 't know how to make a speech . Anyone less tongue-lied can hardly imagine- - Are you all right ? - Just take the note ot Justine . - Should I call Father ? No . Just go . - It 's happening again , isn 't it ? - William , please . I hope I never fall in love . It must be awful . The bullet 's out . You 'll mend now . So what are you , huh ? Convict on the run ? What 's your name ? You got no name ? Ah ... You mean my name ? De Lacey . Where do you come from ? Ah ... I 'll get you some food . [ Crying ] Now , listen . I don 't know where you 're from , and I don 't know what you 've done . I 'm blind ... but I 'm going to help you . Understand ? [ Elizabeth ] Victor ? - Victor ? - Coming . Victor , what are you doing ? We 're all waiting . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . - What are you looking at ? - You . Whoo ! That was our golden time , both his and mine- - a summer full of laughter . Elizabeth and I and pledged our love ... and his world ? His world was filled with wonder . All through those days , while we played in the sun , my brother carried Clerval 's love letters to our neighbor Justine and brought back her replies on scented paper . And week by week , his strength returned , step by step ... with mine . Touche ! You cheated . Nonsense . You were a mile off . I hope it doesn 't give you nightmares . Nightmares ? William , what a thing I say . Come on ! Before the autumn turned the leaves , he was almost everything I 'd planned . You sew these together . Like this . See ? Huh ? Then you have a warm coat for the winter . Win ... ter . Yeah . Winter . Yeah . Yeah . When- - When it 's cold . When the snow comes . Here . Try it on . Aah ! Blast it ! There 's a cloth in the house by the fire . Cloth . Do you understand ? - Cloth ? - I ... under ... stand . Good . One word , I 'll cut your throat . Who is he , De Lacey ? Escaped prisoner ? - What 's he worth ? - I don 't know what you mean . What 's his bounty , you little runt ? 100 , 500 ? How much ? - We mean to collect , see ? - Aah ! Stand still ! Stand still ! Don 't move ! Get the rope , Jack ! Quick ! Get the rope around his legs , Jack . We 're going to be rich ! Aah ! - Run ! - Aah ... Don 't kill me ! He made me do it ! Leave ... Lacey ... alone ! Go ! Stay away from me . Stay away from me ! I 've got a knife ! I 've got a knife ! - Lacey . - Oh ! Oh ! Thank God . I heard the gun . I thought they 'd killed you . Where are they ? Are they gone ? Yes ... gone . - Are you sure ? - Yes , Lacey . - Sure . - I know who they are . I heard their voices . They 're hunters from the valley . What 's this ? Oh . We 'll have to be careful now . You know that , don 't you ? - They might be back . - Perhaps we knew it even then . His peaceful world was almost gone , as mine was soon to be . - Well played , Elizabeth ! - Clerval , do you have to leave ? Tomorrow . My publisher won 't wait . - You 'll be at the wedding ? - Of course . - He 's best man . - Not anymore . I finally persuaded this rascal to do his duty . William , you said yes ! If I don 't have to make a speech . I said you didn 't have to write one . - Who 'll write it ? - You 're the poet . Oh , I see . It 's a conspiracy . This calls for a celebration . Come inside , all of you . I 've got some champagne . Excellent year , too . This has been the perfect summer , hasn 't it ? Mm-hmm . But it 's over now . Look at those clouds . [ Thunder ] Are you there ? Where are you ? Are you there ? Where- - - Where are you ? - Here , Lacey . You 've got to go . Now . There 's no time to lose . - Now ? - They 're coming to get you . Those men- - I heard them talking in the village . They 're getting their gang together . They 're going to kill you ! This way , I 'll take you through the woods . Come on . Don 't you understand ? They 're coming to kill you ! Rrr ! When you reach the road , just keep going . That will take you over the mountain where you come from . You 'll be miles away by morning . And stay away from towns . - You can 't trust people . - Lacey ... - road . - Show me . That way . I can 't go no further . I 'd never be able to find my way back . - Understand ? - I understand . So , uh ... that 's goodbye , then . Listen . I don 't know what you 've done , and I don 't care . But if you ever need me again ... Well ... go on . And don 't look back . That 's- - that 's bad luck . That 's what my dad used to tell me . Uh ... wait . Wait . Uh ... you take , uh ... take this . I 've had this for years . Buy some bread . - Buy some bread with it . - Oh . No , Lacey . No . But you 'll need to eat . It 's a long way from home , isn 't it ? - Home ? - Yeah . Where you live . In your own country . No home , Lacey . No home . God bless you . He might have found a place of safety somewhere in those endless hills , but fate was stronger even than him , and it drew him to me , just as surely as the river finds the sea . We can have a pagoda here with lanterns and the band there and tables spread out here with a lot of food . - You know what I 've been thinking ? - Hmm ? - If we waited another whole year ... - Yes ? We could have a double wedding . You think he 's reciting a poem to her ? A whole epic . [ Bell Tolls ] Heavens . Is that the time ? He 'll miss his coach . - Clerval , isn 't it time for you to go ? - I 'm afriad so . He 's coming back next month , Elizabeth . Isn 't that wonderful ? It is for me . It 's my wedding . Victor , Clerval 's leaving . Victor . Victor , Clerval 's leaving . [ Clerval ] It 's the last one today . Waiting till the last minute . I wonder why . - Don 't tease him , Victor . - He teases me . You deserve it . Ah , but do you deserve the attentions of this lady ? Victor , it 's none of our business . You could be throwing your affections away . - You don 't know that , do you ? - No , but ... Ha ha ! Come on , Justine . We 'll get our coats . - Well ? - What ? You 've asked her to marry you , but in the poem ? Do you think William would give it to her ? You poets are so full of ... courage ? [ Thunder ] [ Scraping Sound ] [ Scraping Continuing ] Hmm . [ Scraping ] Hello ? Is anybody there ? Is anybody there ? Uh ! Oh ! Oh ! I saw you at the big house ... - in the garden . - Aah ! Oh ! - For you . - Aah ! No . Aah ! Aah ! - Oh ! - No ! Go away ! No ! - Who are you ? - No ! [ Whinnying ] No ! No ! Aargh ! - No ! - William ! William ! Oh , my God ! No ! No ! Uh ! Oh ... William ! [ Crying ] Aah ! That dawn , even the birds fell silent . Our world had become a land of shadows , haunted by the Death of Death . It 's loaded , sir . Shame to shoot him . Got to he 's dangerous . [ Horse Whinnies ] [ Praying In Latin ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Praying In Latin ] Amen . - What happened ? - She killed the boy . - Last night ? - She 's paid for it now . - Hup ! - Walk on . Why ? Why ? Oh , God . [ Sobbing ] Why ? Oh , why ? Oh , why ? Here ... drink this . - Why did he kill William ? - Darling , do stop saying that . Nobody killed William . It was the horse . - The horse threw him . - It was him . - Who , darling ? Who ? - Oh , God . - It was the devil . - [ Door Opens ] What is that in her hand ? Justine ... give that to me . Give it to me . - Father , what are you doing ? - This is William 's cross . I gave it to him . Why did you take it ? To take any his protection ? - The protection of God ? - Father , please . She 's not well . Justine , who broke the cross of Christ ? The devil ! It was the devil ! - The devil ! - She doesn 't know what she 's saying . She 's upset . Justine , stop this ! - Mary , Mother of God ... - I 'll take care of her . - Father , I promise . - This woman is ... is ... - possessed ! - Aah ! [ Praying In Latin ] - Amen . - Amen . - Amen . - Uh-huh . Yes . - Ohh ... - Come . Come , my dear . - Why didn 't you tell us ? - I didn 't know . But if this ... thing . Is all you say it is , it was bound to survive . I know that now . God , I know . But why the silence ? All these months ... Victor , your brother is dead . I 'm in shame and torment for it . It 's as if I killed him . What do you mean ? I made him from me , from my body , my brain , but he was meant to be perfect , without my flaws . He was meant to be strong and wise , too strong for disease- - Oh , God ... Oh , Victor . What have you done ? Look after Justine , and always remember that I love you . Both of you . Where are you going ? Well , I made him . I must destroy him . Wait ! Victor , he 'll kill you , too . Victor ! Come back ! He 'll kill you , too ! Victor ! I searched the hills for these whole days . Then I sensed him ... like a shadow in my mind . I 'd never seen this place before , but every blade of grass was suddenly familiar . He had seen it . He was somewhere in this valley . May I water my horse ? Only if you 're drinking . Come on , boy . Ale . You 're well-armed . - What are you- - a hunter ? - I 'm looking for someone ... a big man , living wild . Ever hear of someone like that ? Five francs . Any of you gentlemen seen a stranger ? Big man , living rough ? - Uh ! - Ha ha ! - Leave me alone . - I 'm trying to help . I don 't need help . Is that your sport- - baiting blind men ? The moment that blind man touched my face , I knew . - Five francs . - [ Coin Clinks ] He needed to know who I was , and he 'd heard who I was looking for . I was close now ... very close . Blind man ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Where is he ? - What do you want ? - Where is he ? There 's nobody here . You can see for yourself . - Where ? - I don 't know . He said he was going . That 's all I know . I swear it ! He said ? Don 't hurt me . Please don 't hurt me . He spoke ? He can talk ? Look , I know nothing . Leave me alone . Can he talk ? Yeah , yeah . He 's a foreigner , but he- - he learns quick . Then he can reason ... already . I don 't know when he 's done . I know nothing about it . I swear . What do you want him for , huh ? What has he done ? He killed my brother . Come on ! Go on ! - [ Whinnying ] - Oh ! Oh ! Grr . Uh ! Grr . Help me . Uhh ... Help me . Please . Please . Please . Please . Help me . Uh ! Help , please ! Please help me . Grr ! You come to kill . Now you will give . You come to kill me ! Now you will give ! Give what ? You made me ... and you give me nothing . You made me ... and you teach me nothing . Why did you make me like this ? Men come for me with horses , hunt me with guns ! Where is my place ? I have no place ! You have everything . I see you ... in your houses ... in your gardens . You have everything , and I have nothing . You made me like this ! - Now you will give ! - What do you want ? What do you want ? - A woman . - What ? A woman ! Like you have a woman . You ... you ... will give me a woman ! - No , I can 't . - You can ! You can make a woman , like you made me . Tall and strong , like me . To love me ... as I am . As your woman loves you . And I will go ... away from this place , away from your hoses and your guns , away from all of you . You will see me no more . But first ... you will give me a woman . - And what if I refuse ? - Eh ... then ... you will see me on your wedding night . On your wedding night . Grr . Oh , Justine , please take it . It 's laudanum . It 'll make you sleep . Oh , darling , it wasn 't the devil . It was ! I saw him . He killed William , and he 'll come back for me . - I saw him . - Yes , but it wasn 't the devil . I 've explained it . Try- [ Loud Knocking ] - Uh ! [ Knocking ] - [ Knocking ] - I 'll come back . [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] - What is it ? - Shh ! Put that light out . - [ Knocking ] - Who 's there ? [ Victor ] Father , it 's me ! Open the door ! Oh , Victor . Thank heavens you 're safe . - What 's happened to you ? - I need your horse . My horse ? Why ? Victor , in heaven 's name , why ? - To get rid of him . - A wife ? If I hadn 't promised , God knows how many lives he 'd destroy . - Why would he go away ? - That 's what I 'd do . You ? Elizabeth , if the only way I could be with you was to live it the ends of the Earth , that 's exactly what I 'd do . So he will do the same . Now do you understand ? He 's you , isn 't he ? Yes . - Who will you use ? - I 'll find someone . - Is it dangerous ? - It 's painful , but it won 't kill if- - Oh , no . I won 't do it , Elizabeth . - I won 't do it ! - Who else will you get ? I don 't know . I 'll find someone . - Some unsuspecting maid ? - Not you ! You 're not thinking ! Who will agree to it ? - You 're my whole life . - He creature you make will be his . The perfect match . Isn 't that what he wants ? The perfect match . I 'll pack my clothes . That journey back to Ingolstadt was the longest of my life . What had I embarked upon ? The compounding of a blasphemy ? The doubling of a sin ? I think I knew it even then . I knew that I was damned . [ Clock Strikes The Hour ] We 're here . Thanks . No need to wait . Careful . Wait here . I 'll find a lamp . Careful . There 's glass . So much ! I had no idea . Will she be like me ? Or like him ? It will be dawn soon . A fresh new day . Let 's finish the work ... of the old one . - Will I be ill ? - A little . Just know that I love you . Hmm ! Uh ... Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! - Elizabeth ! - Aah ! - Oh ! Oh ! - It 's all right . Oh , you 're safe now . You 're safe . - Oh . - Lie still . Lie still . - I 'll get you something . - Uh ! Uh ! May God ... forgive me . Here . Breathe in . Breathe in deeply . - It will clear your head . - [ Coughing ] Oh , my darling ! It 's all right . It 's all right , darling . It 's over , darling . It 's over . You were in too much pain . It 's over . - What happened ? - You were in too much pain , darling . I had to stop it . I had to destroy it . Vic- - Victor . No ! No ! No ... Aah ! Aah ! Aah . Stay . Stay . Come away . Come away . Come away . The link was finally broken . I was free ... free at last . On the journey home , Elizabeth slept the sleep of the just , but I was haunted by voices- - William 's laughter and the cries of poor Justine . [ Horses Approaching ] Whoa ! - Father . - Victor . Victor . Victor , Clerval 's here . Justine 's dead . She took her own life this morning . Oh , my God . Forgive him ? How can I forgive him ? You 've destroyed two lives , Victor ! Two innocent young lives because of your bloody science ! I can 't forgive you ! Only God can ! - Clerval , stop , please ! - No . He 's right , elizabeth . If I could put the clock back , I 'd give my own life . And if you could put back the clock , what would you find there ? The shriveled remnant of your soul . Or is that lost forever ? - Enough ! - No ! It 's not have enough ! I pity you with all my heart . That thing you made while laughing in the face of God isn 't the killer . The killer is you ! You ! [ Waltz Playing ] That same month , Elizabeth and I were wed . With our fears behind us and our future bright , we faced a whole new life . What ? Live on my own ? Certainly not . The moment they 've left , I 'm closing the house - and touring the orient . - Ha ha ! Excuse me . - Clerval . Clerval , you came . - To apologize . Oh , what a wonderful day this has been . Come with me . - Oh , Victor , look ! - Clerval 's here ! Hello , Victor . Elizabeth . Couldn 't let you eat all this food by yourself . I 'm sorry , Victor . I 'm truly sorry . Good God , man . What for ? Come and have a drink . Drink ? I haven 't danced with the bride yet . Well , Victor . Now your great day 's complete . Let 's go have a drink . - Is that the last one ? - I hope so . She 's got enough dresses to last a year . - You 're not complaining already ? - Already ? I 've been married 12 hours . You 'll love Venice . It 's the most romantic city in the world , although it has its drawbacks . I went swimming every day until somebody told me- - - Get inside . - What ? - Get inside . - Victor , what are you talking- - Coachman , you know the village Barracks ? The Military Barracks ? I want a detachment of men with muskets . - Muskets ? - Don 't arcus , man . - Go ! - Hyah ! Go ! - Victor , have you gone mad ? - Quiet . Victor , what is wrong with you ? - He 's here . - What ? He 's not dead . He 's here . Get Elizabeth and Father and bring them down here now ! Run , Clerval ! Run ! Where is Elizabeth ? Upstairs . Changing for the journey . Elizabeth ! Elizabeth ! - [ Elizabeth ] Aah ! - God ! It 's in the house ! No ! No ! Father ! Oh , my God ! - Victor ! - Elizabeth ! - Aah ! - Elizabeth ! Elizabeth ! - Oh , my God ! - Aah ! - Elizabeth ! - Aah ! No ! Leave her ! Leave her ! Victor ! Victor ! Leave her alone ! I 'll kill you ! Elizabeth ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Aah ! You ! You ! You ! Where are you ? Where are you ? Can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? I swear ... by the God who made me ... I will destroy you ! I will follow you to the ends of the Earth ! And I 'll not rest until you 're dead ! You hear me ? Dead ! Dead ! Dead ! Dead ! [ Sobbing ] Dr. Frankenstein ? Sir ? What is it ? What 's wrong ? Close those windows , and cover up the others . I want the Magistrate here- - now . Take my horse . The Magistrate will formally charge you with three murders . Have you anything to say ? I told you before- - I didn 't do it . Oh , for Heaven 's sake , man . Who 's going to believe that ? - Blood 's still on your hands . - Ugh ! Corporal ! Corporal ! Shoot ! Shoot that man ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Oh ... In a single day , my world had gone , vanished into memory . - It was his world now ... - Aah ! and where he went , I was sworn to follow , two parts of a single man , locked ... in hate ... and loathing . I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill you ! That was half a world ago , but now he has no place to hide . Help me rid the world of this evil . You say he 'll attack the ship at dawn . - You 're sure ? - He has no choice . Even he can 't survive another night on the ice , so he 's mine , at last . - Busun ? - Sir . Get Zorkin and his watch . Now . Aye , Sir . - [ Bosun ] Zorkin ! - Captain , will you do something for me ? - Will you keep this somewhere ? - What is it ? My diary . Will you keep it for me ? - Your diary ? - My story . Everything I 've told you . I want you to keep it safe . - Will you do that ? - On the quarter-deck , Skipper . Stay with our guest . - Where is he going ? - That 's his business , isn 't it ? - All armed ? - [ All ] Aye , Sir . You see his fire . Come at him from behind . Get round the back of him . 50 francs , Zorkin , when you bring me his head . - Understand ? - Jack and I fought Napoleon , Captain . He won 't see the sun rise . [ All ] Ha ha ! It 's a wonder he hasn 't frozen to death already . We 'll freeze him . - How long till dawn ? - Hour at the mist , eh , Bosun ? Aye , Sir . Captain , I 've got to tell the men what to expect . These men- - they know what to expect . - Hmm . - More rum , Sir ? It 's the difference between life and death . All right , what ever your name is , you 've had your say . Now , listen . No one harms this ship , understand ? So thank your stars for a man called Zorkin . - Zorkin ! - Ha ha ! Zorkin ! What have you done ? Captain , what have you done ? Zorkin , who are we killing this time ? [ Zorkin ] A man worth 50 francs . Did you hear that , boys ? I 'd kill the King of Spain for 50 francs ! Ha ha ha ! Oh , this is madness ! He 'll kill them all ! Calm down . You want him dead , don 't you ? - Well , Zorkin kills a man in every port . - That 's why he 's with us . He can 't set foot on land . Cap 'n , dawn 's coming up . - You said an hour . - I said an hour at the most . Now , let 's go see them in . - Any sign of them ? - No , Sir . They 'll freeze dead if they don 't turn back soon . Skipper , on the starboard quarter . - What do you see ? - Black dots on the ice . It 's them . They 're coming back . And 50 francs richer . Mother of God ! - What is it ? - Bosun , get down here . Aye , Sir . - Is it them ? - It 's them , all right . Get cannons to port and starboard . Keep a man aloft with his eyes skinned . - For what ? - The thing that did that . Hey ! What is it ? What hit us ? Nothing . It 's the ice- - it 's moving ! Ya-ha , lads ! Unlash that wheel ! Mister , it couldn 't have come at better time . Unlash that wheel . When this stuff moves , it moves . - Will the ship come free ? - Within minutes . When the ice goes , the current will pull us out into the open sea . We 're all saved . Now , get my sextant . - Where ? - Cabin . Come on , lads ! Stand by on the rigging ! Ugh ! Now ... now you 'll pay ! Here ... in this place . What are you going to do ? Kill me ? Why here ? Why kill me here ? You had your chance a hundred times before this . Why lead me here ? Why ? To make you feel ... pain ... like me . Fear ... and pain ... like me ! Make me feel your pain ? You did all this to make me feel your pain ? There was no need . I felt it from the start . Your pain ... is mine . Is my pain not yours ? Perhaps ... you haven 't understood . When you kill me ... you will die . We 're one . Don 't you know it ? Can you feel it ? We ... are ... one . But ... I cannot live ... in your world . Nor I in yours . Please ... help me ! Please help me ! Please ... - help me . - I will . I will help us both . I will . I will help us both . Aah ! Man overboard ! Captain ! Captain ! - Lower the boat , Spencer ! - Too late . - Sir ? - I said , " too late . " They 'll be dead when our boat hits the water . Stand by to lower the boat ! Wind 's on the starboard beam , Skipper . Steer west-sou 'west . Steer west-sou 'west . Stand by to lower the mainsail ! Come on , boys ! Look lively ! - We 're going home ! - Hurray ! " Ship 's log- - 14th of March , 1820 . " With a fair wind , we should make landfall within a week . " I am submitting this small book along with the ship 's papers .

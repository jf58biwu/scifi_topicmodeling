Rosewood , bones and Lucifer . - What 's your name ? - Lucifer . Like the devil ? Only on fox . Previously on " second chance " ... I spend my whole life when I should 've been protecting the world from you . Connor : You cheated death to save her life . And now she abandoned you , didn 't she ? [ Voice breaking ] Yes . Alexa : It 's some kind of power surge . Otto : Shut it all down . Arthur : If I leave , the tank won 't support Mr. Pritchard . [ Grunts ] Without Arthur , the tank is useless . So , I got what , about a day ? Mary : She 's a Pritchard . Gracie has the genetic precursor . Where is she ? ! I know where Gracie is . Adair : Agent Pritchard , I 'm relieving you of duty effective immediately . * Duval : I need to talk to you fellas . Gracie is in trouble . I can 't be locked down for 72 hours . We 're just taking you in , Duval . Bobby , how long we worked together ? You both know me . You know Gracie . [ Cellphone ringing ] Mary , now 's not a good time . Alexa came back . She says she knows where Gracie is . All right . Bring her to Peng 's . I 'll meet you there . Just trust me . Gracie is in trouble . Just let me go . Let me get out . Please let me go get her . We 're just taking you in , okay ? [ Body thuds , tires screech ] You hit someone ? ! No , I didn 't hit someone . [ Grunting ] How you doing , kiddo ? Thanks for coming for me . Of course . Let 's go get Gracie . Hey ! Hey , Duval ! [ Engine revs ] [ Yelling ] Connor : You been making some trouble for us , haven 't you , Albert , huh ? He escaped when we were moving him for testing . I 'm sure you 're gonna want to run some tests on him , right ? No . The blood and tissue samples you have of his are all I need . Are you sure about that ? Yes . I 'm sure . [ Yelling continues ] Aah ! Aah ... [ gunshots ] Hey , have that incinerated . [ Monitor beeping ] - We 'll make her talk . - You better . You were spying for Connor this whole time ? Yes . And you know where Gracie is ? I know where he 'd take her . What do you mean , you know where he 'd take her ? Connor owns 200 acres of land north of the city . That 's where the lab is . How do we find it ? It 's an abandoned missile base , so most of it 's underground . You wouldn 't see it unless you knew it was there . How do you know all about this place ? I lived there , underground , for almost a year . Doing what for Connor ? I did nothing for Connor . That 's where he did things to me . She 's one of Otto 's . I 'm just like you , except one thing . What ? You 're perfect . That 's why Otto kept you . Albert and I weren 't . That 's why he threw us away . And Connor finished them . And then he started experimenting on us , trying to figure out how he could make it work for himself . That 's what he does there . You don 't want Gracie there . Trust me on that . How do we know you 're not working for Connor right now ? We can 't . She 's lied to us this whole time . But , Duval , Gracie 's your kid . - It 's your call . - Go . You know this place well enough to draw us a map ? Yes . I know it very well . The lab is in the most secure spot , which is the old mission fire control area . There 's only way to get in , and it 's across this bridge . Connor says that there are machine guns stationed out here . The guns are still there , but now they 're triggered by a digital scan that you 'll have to pass through . So you 'll have to get into the office first to turn it off . - Where 's the office ? - Over here . If you go there with us , will they let you in ? You can get to the office ? [ Whirring , monitor beeping ] - Where 's your car ? - Out back . Keys . We go together , the three of us . You drop us off when we get close to the gate , and we go in on foot . Let 's go . Where is your tank ? M-my tank is in the garage , but , Mary , you know it won 't work on him . [ Clicking ] What was that with Alexa ? She 's just like you . She has a tank . Well , isn 't that good news ? There 's a lock code just for her . If you step in , it 'll kill you . You 're gonna unlock it , though , aren 't you ? 'Cause you 're Mary Goodwin , and you always get what you want . How long is it gonna take to unlock ? More than eight hours . But just come back , okay ? If I can get her tank to work for you , this doesn 't have to be your last day . You don 't have to die . Everybody dies . [ Round chambers ] [ Electricity humming ] How old were you ... Before ? 82 . 82 . How 'd you die ? Slipped [ Chuckles ] coming out of the shower . George always wanted me to get one of those suction grab bars , but they were so ugly . Not as ugly as a cracked skull . I bought two of those things right off the TV . Just up ahead . You two should get out here . You ready to show Graff why he should never have messed with the Pritchards ? Yeah . I 'm ready . The software on this tank has been coded for a specific user . I need you to unlock the code so it can be used for someone else . The tank ... What does it do ? It interfaces with the user 's genetic structure . Yeah , but what does it do ? It gives $ 1 million cash to the first person who opens the code . [ Indistinct talking ] [ Keys clacking ] I overheard you and Mary back at Peng 's . I know about the tank . Mary 's got a plan to fix it . Didn 't sound like that was gonna happen . No , it didn 't . Well , how much time do you have left ? About eight hours . [ Sighs ] You know , how you were before , there were times I hated you were my father . I know we didn 't see eye to eye , but hated ? I didn 't know that . That 's most likely the reason I did . You never knew your family . I think I know you now . Yeah . I think you do , too . [ Computer beeps ] Connor : What 's Alexa doing here ? [ Whirring ] Help me , please . Please , please , you have to ... You have to help me . Wait . I know you , don 't I ? No . Y-you 're Otto Goodwin . My ... my uncle ... my uncle knows your sister . My name is Gracie Pritchard . You have to help me . Please ? [ Breathes shakily ] I can 't . [ Voice breaking ] Why ? What is this place ? What are you doing to me ? I don 't want to be here ! Please help me ! [ Crying ] Help ! [ Air hissing ] [ Breathing heavily ] Here . Okay , now you 're doing it ... Looking at your watch . Sorry . I didn 't mean to . Alexa should be in there by now . Access scan initiated . [ Rapid beeping ] Clear . Alexa , is everything all right ? Yes . Uh , no . It 's George . He 's having second thoughts . I need you to go faster so that he doesn 't change his mind . There was no reason for you to come here . I know . I 'm sorry . No , no , what I mean is there was no reason for you to come all the way out here . Yet you did . You search her ? Top to bottom . - You search her car ? - No . All right . All right , you ... You put her in a chair . You point your gun at her head . She moves , you pull the trigger , all right ? Now , you , come with me . [ Breathing heavily ] Okay . [ Sighs ] It 's taking too long . I say you rip open this fence while you can and we go in now . Give her two minutes . Okay . Two minutes . [ Crickets chirping ] Stop ! It 's ... My medication is in there . If I don 't take it , I would be in no shape to answer Connor 's questions . Okay . Real slow . See ? Oxycontin ... For pain . I came out twisted ... My spine and internal organs . [ Pills rattle ] [ Exhales sharply ] I 'm on more pills now than I was when I was old . That sucks . [ Grunting ] It does suck . What exactly am I looking for ? I 'll tell you when you find it . She didn 't come back just to whine about that old windbag of hers . [ Car door opens ] [ Cellphone vibrating ] Alexa ? I 'm there . I 'm in Connor 's office . I 'm gonna bypass the security panel for that section of the fence . [ Keypad beeping ] [ Sighs ] Then you can go through , and it won 't sound the alarm . Now , tell me when you get to the access door . Just hurry . [ Grunts ] Phone . Alexa ? Okay . Security disabled . Door open . [ Door buzzes , handle creaks ] [ Round chambers ] [ Keys clacking ] [ Grunts ] Wait . Kiddo , this way . James : Alexa , we 're at the bridge . Now , head to the middle and stop when it tells you . I won 't be able to clear your entry until the scanner scans you , but ... Hopefully it 'll be quick . How do you know all this ? You were spying on Connor , too ? George said never to trust him . Hold your position . Access scan initiated . [ Rapid beeping ] Come on . Come on . [ Door opens ] Hello , Otto . Arthur said you were here . I asked him to let me know when you came ... So I could see you . Well , here I am . All this time with us ... With Mary ... I didn 't see you for what you are ... Something I made . Well , I had no face when you threw me away . Now that you know what I am , Otto , what do you want from me ? I 'm not angry at you , if that 's what you 're thinking , for throwing me away . My blood wasn 't gonna cure Mary . What good was I ? [ Rapid beeping ] Access in question . Remain still . Otto : No . Your blood was never going to save Mary , but the deformity ... Is not as severe as I had predicted . May I see it ? Your spine ? You ... Want to examine me . Yes . Now that I know what you really are ... There are tests to run . Yes , of course . Maybe we can do it in the lab . Of course . I 'll prep a table . Why stand in that part of the room ? It 's an odd place to stand . The only reason to stand in that part of the room is to access the security control panel . [ Thud ] Shh ! Be quiet , or I will leave you to die like you left me . [ Rapid beeping ] Clear . Arthur : Alexa , you are hurting Otto . Activating alarm . [ Exhales sharply ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Blaring continues ] Hey , we 've been breached . Move the girl ! Make sure Otto is safe . [ Blaring continues ] Alexa : You guys have to get to the lab ! There 's not much time now . Duval , here . Where 's Gracie ? We lost her ? Where the hell is she ? ! [ Breathing heavily ] Where 's Gracie ? Gracie ! Gracie ! [ Distantly ] Gracie ! Dad ? What the hell did they do to her in here ? Duval . [ Door opens ] [ Breathing heavily ] Where is she ? I don 't know . Then you 're worthless to me . [ Round chambers ] Wait . Wait . Connor needs Otto . He can 't make this work without Otto . Is that true , Otto ? Connor need you ? Yes . Duval , Connor needs Otto . [ Grunts ] Graff ... I know you can hear me . I 'm gonna put a bullet through your genius if I don 't see my daughter down here in five minutes . Now , you 've got five minutes . [ Exhales sharply ] Let them have the girl . We take Otto and go . He 's what you need , right ? So let them have the girl . The girl ? Let them have the girl ? Yeah . Otto says that it 's going to work with her , that he 's close with her . How can I just let them have the girl ? You 've got less than five minutes ! [ Chair clatters ] Graff ! You hear me ? Yeah , I heard you . [ Switch clicks ] I 'll bring her down to you . And I need Otto unharmed , in good working order . You feel me ? [ Switch clicks ] Alexa : I don 't trust him . These tanks ... They work like his ? Yes . But if you 're thinking they will work for your father ... They won 't . Because the code is locked . But you 're Otto Goodwin , and everyone says that you 're a genius . There 's not enough time . Maybe this will make you work faster . This what you gave my daughter ? You put this into Gracie ? [ Gasps ] You don 't need both eyes , do you ? One count as " good working order " ? Now unlock the code on that tank ... now . I don 't have time . Then make time . Gracie : Dad ? Duval . Listen . Gracie : Dad ? Move . [ Round chambers ] Gracie , we 're here . Whoa . You let Otto come forward , we let the girl go to you . She doesn 't make it all the way to us , he doesn 't make it all the way to you . Those are the rules . Those are the rules . Let 's do it . I don 't trust them . Keep your eyes open . Dad ? All this because you didn 't want to be alone , because Mary wanted her own life . Was it worth it , Otto ? We gonna do this or not ? Now you let Gracie come to us . Move . That 's it , Gracie . Come on . It 's okay . It 's all right . That 's it . Come here . We 're going home . No . No . Alexa : She 's a hologram . And I think garret is , too . So where is the real garret ? Aah ! [ Gunfire in distance ] " These things will kill you . " " Not me they won 't . " Ugh ! Aah ! [ Breathing heavily ] I don 't feel as good about that as I thought I would . Man : I have Otto and am 90 seconds from emergency egress . Alexa ! Where 's emergency egress ? Door 7 ... End of this corridor . Just keep making lefts , you 'll run right into it . I 'll get her . Go ! You 're hit . [ Exhales sharply ] It 's nothing . Go get Gracie ! [ Door opens ] Otto . Hey , are you hurt ? I 'm not hurt . I-I 'm sorry that you had to go through that . But you 're safe . I took care of it , okay ? Hey , Otto , you know I wouldn 't leave you . You know that , right ? I know , Connor . You 're all I have . All right . Let 's go . Hey , hey , get back down there , kill them all , then burn this place to the ground . On it . Let 's go . [ Sniffing ] [ Warbling ] [ Groaning ] [ Both grunting ] [ Groaning ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Round chambers ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] Come on . [ Groans ] [ Whirring ] * She 's gone . We lost her . [ Indistinct talking ] [ Door opens , closes ] Where are we going ? Well , you choose , Otto . [ Chuckles ] I have redundant labs in Kosovo , Senegal , Oman . I should have let her die . Who ? Mary . I should have let her die . I 'm sorry you hate her so much , Otto . Just try not to think about Mary right now . She doesn 't control you anymore . You 're free . Can you come here ? What 's that ? Please , Connor , come here . Yeah , sure . Let me just set the autopilot . [ Switch clicks ] What is it , Otto ? Everything 's okay . [ Speaking twin-speak ] I-I don 't understand that . You 're gonna have to teach me twin-speak . " Did you get what you wanted ? " That 's what Pritchard said to me . Mary would have said she 's not a subject . She 's a person . We are going to be gods . So don 't hate Mary too much 'cause we do have to thank her illness for that . I don 't hate her . I should have let her die so that she would never have hated me . Now she does ... Because we 're not gods ... We 're monsters . What are you doing here , Otto ? Arthur ? Yes , Otto ? Her father is waiting for her . Take her back down to him . Hey , no , I-i can 't allow that , Otto . I know . We 're both monsters , Connor . Arthur , open the doors . See you later , Otto . No ! [ Screaming ] Gracie ? Dad ? You 're here ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's me . I 'm here . You should get her to a hospital . I will . And then I 'm gonna come back for you . No . Let 's leave it like this , with us getting Gracie , me helping you do it . I don 't want you to go . I know . But it 's okay . [ Sighs ] I 'm okay with it . I did what I had to do ... With you ... With my family . We had our day , kiddo . I don 't want you to see what happens next . [ Sighs ] Just go . I got to be with my son . Go be with your daughter . [ Exhales sharply ] Where are Otto and Connor ? Was that Mary ? [ Seat belt clicks ] She unlock it ? [ Breathing heavily ] [ Sniffs ] Did you tell her about Otto ? Yes , but I think she felt it . She asked if he was dead . [ Crying ] It 's a nice day for a drive . I told Alexa to bring me here . I hope it 's okay . I wanted to be here . I need to sit down . You saved Gracie . No . Otto saved Gracie . He did it for you , Mary . [ Exhales sharply ] It 's gonna be okay . [ Sobs ] We 're all leaving you ... Otto ... Me . You gonna be okay ? Yeah . I 'm going to be okay . [ Sniffles ] The pain will start soon . I can get something so you don 't feel it . [ Weakly ] No . Then ... I wouldn 't ... Feel this . Hey . Guess what . What ? This time , when my life flashes before my eyes ... You 'll be in it . [ Chuckles ] [ Monitor beeping ] Hey . Guys . Hey , guys . [ Gasps ] Hey , guys ! [ Cellphone chimes ] Wait . Stop . Alexa ... she needs this more than I do . I told you ... I 'm fine . I need six more hours before I have to go in . You first . Come on . [ Water splashing ] [ Monitor beeping ] Arthur , did Otto tell you to do this ? Yes . It was his last command . Did he leave a message for me ? He said please don 't forget to feed his fish ... And thank you . Goodbye , Mary . [ Indistinct conversations ] Duval : You there ? You seeing it ? I 'm seeing something . I 'm not sure what it is , but I think you should come in . Do I need to bring a lawyer ? No . Let 's keep it between us for now . Okay . I 'm coming in . [ Keypad beeps ] [ Breathes deeply ] Adair saw it . She 's not sure what it is , but she knows it 's not right . You want me to come in to the FBI with you ? No . Thanks . And I 'm gonna tell them that you died in that plane , too . Why ? Because if it gets out ... What you are ... Then you become a circus freak . They 'd lock you up in a government lab and throw away the key . Whatever life you wanted , whatever life you 'd planned , it would be over . My family was my plan . You , Gracie , Helen ... That 's what I want . That can 't happen ... Now . Adair knows . She 'll be watching me . So I 'm gonna tell her you died in that plane . So you can 't come around us . Could you just let me say hi to Gracie ? Not for a while , okay ? It 'll be best for all of us . [ Sighs ] Yeah , okay . I 'm gonna head in . Okay . Hey , kiddo ... We kicked some ass , didn 't we ? Yeah . I love you , too . Hey , Arthur , how about some local news , huh ? That blond weather gal always cheers me up . [ Breathes deeply ] No Arthur . Right . Well , I 'm pretty sure I can turn on a damn TV by myself . [ Breathes deeply ] Mary : James , as you read this , I will be taking my brother 's body home to where our family is from . [ Sighs ] I will take his ashes home and pray that at last it will bring some peace to his troubled mind . And then I am going to stay here for a while . Maybe this place will bring peace to me , as well . I put these words on paper because if I said them to you , I might not go , and I need to go . I have been living for another for so long , I don 't know who I am . I have said I love you , but until I know who I am , how can I mean it ? And I want to mean it . I 've arranged things with Alexa ... The tank , money , the house ... So you don 't have to worry about that . Take care of yourself , sheriff . I hold you close in my thoughts . Yours , Mary . V-I-i . Good job . Well done . Do you need help ? The stick man is looking for you . Thank you . [ Indistinct conversations ] Arthur , where have you been ? Otto : It 's not Arthur , Mary . It 's me . Otto ? Is that you ? How ? Not now . Mary , listen . When I was at Connor 's lab , Arthur and I went through all his data . We found something you need to see . It 's a test Connor ran to predict changes in behavior after regeneration . This fish was brought back . The violence is inevitable . I verified the results . This will happen to Pritchard . It 's only a matter of time . [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Thunder crashes ] Now here are a few more shows to check out from fox . Welcome to the toughest challenge of your life . Four decorated heroes ...

 Why do you keep looking out the window , Will ? You like the snow ? You know , for some people , snow brings on a very specific feeling . Uh , some love it . It feels clean and pure , like a ... fresh start or a beginning . For others , it 's frightening . Cold and silent and ... isolating . What are you thinking about when you look at the snow ? That I 'm gonna have to shovel it . Will , I 'm gonna talk to you ... like I would talk to an adult , because I think you 're a very intelligent young man and you are capable of understanding what I 'm saying . In group dynamics , there 's something psychologists call " savior behavior . " Often one person in the group feels ... like they need to save the others from a threat or an emotion that he or she believes is dangerous . Sometimes those people ... are children of parents with drug and alcohol problems . These people have had to ... save themselves from the emotional consequences of their parents ' addiction . Your father was unable to find Sara Patrell and you wanted to help him , didn 't you ? And that 's a perfectly normal response , Will . You wanted to help , that 's a good thing . But sometimes when we try to help one person , another person gets hurt . Sometimes that person 's ourselves , sometimes it 's someone else . And I know your intentions ... weren 't to hurt anyone , but when you say you can see Sara ... or her ghost and talk to her , it causes people a lot of pain . Especially Sara 's parents , who are dealing with the worst thing a parent can go through . Now , I 've been as honest as I can with you , Will . Can you do the same for me ? Are you still seeing Sara ? Shh . No . Welcome to Iceland . Please remain seated with your seat belts fastened until we reach the gate , and the captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign . Oh ... I 'm so cold . Mm . It 's as high as it 'll go . Here ... take my coat . No , no , no , no , no , you need that . I 'm hot-blooded . Don 't worry . I want to keep you both warm . Here . - Oh , it hurts ! A lot . - I know . They 're coming faster . Oh ... Don 't worry , sweetie , I 'll get us there . Just ... Just hang on . What were we thinking with that midwife ? It was a stupid mistake . No , it 's not her . It 's me . It 's the hex . - I 'm hexed . - I 've told you , it 's not the hex . You 're magic . You 're the most magical thing that has ever happened to me . I 'll get us there , I promise . Riley . Magnus . Riley ... come with me . Magnus ? Magnus ... Magnus . Magnus ... no . Magnus ... Oh , no . Oh , my Lúna . My Lúna . Someone 's coming for us . It 'll be OK . Someone 's coming . Will . I 'm coming for you . I have bad news and worse news . - Start with the bad . - I found out where they 're taking her . A research facility controlled by BPO up the coast . - That 's good . - Not really . It 's very heavily secured , but I 'm working on a way in . OK , give me the worse news . A private plane was just cleared for landing with a single passenger on board , Dr. Ellison . - Whispers . - It 's gotta be him . - I 'm ahead of him . - Not for long . A helicopter is there waiting to pick him up . - I 'm gonna need some transportation . - Car 's just confirmed . It 's there . - Are you Will Gorski ? - Yes , I am . Welcome to Iceland . Please , sign here . When did I get expensive taste ? When I got access to Metzger 's credit cards . Ha ! Enjoy the stay . The facility isn 't on any map , but I 've loaded the coordinates into the GPS . It says that you can be there in 20 . I 'll be there in ten . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I won 't leave you . I promise I won 't leave you . My baby ... where is she ? You would have done anything for her . You would have given your life for your baby . Yes . This ... is your last chance . Take it . Protect them . Riley . Protect them . Riley ... please don 't do it . I 'm coming for you . Don 't give up . It might be the best thing that could 've happened . Why ? She 'll be unconscious when Whispers arrives . Where is he now ? He just climbed into the helicopter . He knows you 're here . Do you have a plan for getting in ? I 'm going with a nine-millimeter tucked under my arm . Buffie doesn 't trust you . He believes you know what happened to Steiner . I 've been trying to call my son since yesterday , but he doesn 't respond . Do you know where Steiner is ? I do . Where ? You told me you didn 't want to choose between him or me . Now you don 't have to . Where is my son ? ! I 'd give you details ... but you can ask him yourself very shortly . What ? You fuck ! Careful . I heard the shots . I know the way a bullet sounds when it hits Kevlar . The bodyguard 's gun is gone . You son of a bitch ! Did you kill my son ? Kill that fucking cunt ! What is happening ? I guess I 've come to say goodbye . This was your plan ? How was I supposed to know he 'd be wearing a bulletproof vest ? Who wears a bulletproof vest in real life ? What are you doing ? I 'm not like Sun . I do not know how to use my fists , but ... that doesn 't mean I don 't know how to fight . I am not ready to say goodbye . Oh , fuck ! Why , Wolfgang ? Why ? You 're family . We raised you . What kind of man betrays his own fucking family ? You said that you would have given everything to know who killed my father . I give you that gift . Oh , God . Why ? You know why . You always knew . And still , you did nothing . Wolfgang , I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm so sor ... sorry . I ... Please ... forgive me . You said ... your blood is in my blood . So is his . My father ... was a monster . And so are you . And so am I. That 's why you have to marry Rajan . - Damn it ! - Stop the car . What ? - No , no , no . That 's him . - I know . Whispers is going to get there first . He 's already told security to be looking for you . You need a distraction . Stop the car . Engine 's in the back . Oil line 's along the driver 's side . Pop the trunk . Find the oil line . Break it . - It 'll destroy the car . - I know . It was Amanita 's idea . It 's why we picked this car . Men cannot stand to see a beautiful car in trouble . It 's some kind of primal instinct . Look at you , you 're hesitating . - It 's a really nice car . - See ? What am I supposed to use to get away ? You 're the one that jumped on the first plane to Iceland without a plan . We 're working on an exit strategy . How about this guy ? He 's on vacation . In the meantime , I think we found a way inside . We 've been combing through the employee records , looking for a shell . - I 'm cooking the ID now . - We 'll send it when it 's crispy . You should be able to wave your phone and just walk right in . Seriously ? It 's a square-cube law thing . Bigger and more high tech a company is , the easier it is to use the front door . What about Riley ? I assume since none of us can reach her that she 's still unconscious , which means that she 's safe . Safe ? Here ? Could you explain the whole " don 't look him in the eye " bad guy thing again ? I ... I mean , ' cause I saw him . I was afraid to look at him at first , but ... then I did . Does that mean he can see inside my mind now , too ? No , no , no . Jonas explained it . - No , he 's like us . - He 's sensate . - He can only connect with other sensate . - So she 's safe . Except for the fact that a man that uses zombies to murder people knows who she is , the police are looking for her , she 's using equipment that could get her 20 years in prison , all while aiding and abetting her fugitive lover . Is that what you mean by " safe " ? Hey , Nom , it 's OK . You love her a lot . In my book ... safety 's always been highly overrated . - Such a shame . - It 's a ' 14 . It 's only a year old , man . Oh , hey , man . You 've gotta see it . It 's totally fucked up . Oh , my God ! - I still got nothing here . - It 's on its way . - You sure this is gonna work ? - It 'll work . - Hey . - Hey . Your name is Fred Sloughman . Fred Sloughman . Consolidated Medical Waste . Consolidated Medical Waste , here to check out your ... medical waste . - You been cleared ? - Yeah , right here . - It 's not working . - Step over here . - I don 't understand . - Um ... Step to the side . It 's not working . - It should . - Um ... - Turn up the brightness . - Just a second . Try it again ? - Sorry . - Technology , huh ? Her blood pressure 's dropping . I can barely read her heartbeat . Riley , open your eyes . When I give instructions , I expect them to be followed . She went berserk . She grabbed a gun . I had to use Rocuronium to put her down . I want this woman conscious as soon as possible . She 's no use to me in this condition . If we 're not careful , she could go into anaphylactic shock . You didn 't expect this , did you ? Have you made a mistake ? Wake her up , now . This place is huge . - Know where she 's being held ? - No . - Why not ? - I 'm not the Wizard of Oz . I only have access to what 's in their computer system and she 's not in here . - How do I find her ? - I 'll find her . Lito . Don 't worry . - Do I know you ? - Yeah . We had sex . Wha ... Oh . Uh ... - Eh ... It ... That was ... - Very special . Oh , hey ... Uh ... We 're on a clock here , fellas . Follow me . - How will you find her ? - It 's a secret . I 'm very good at secrets . Oh , my God ... what a day . What a day . He can be difficult , can 't he ? You mean Dr. Ellison ? - Yeah . - Yeah . He told me that I should pay attention to you because ... he says you are very good . He has a lot of respect for you . Really ? I thought he was about to fire me . Welcome to my daily life . I don 't know how you could stand it . Well ... the work is important . Yeah , of course . Once in a while , I get to meet someone who understands ... how hard this job is . - Mm . Yeah , yeah . - You know ? And who happens to be very ... very attractive . - I have to get back to work . - Yeah . - Bye . - Bye . - What room was she in again ? - Um ... - Sixth floor , 620 . - Oh , yeah . Clever , Mr. Gorski . We don 't know how he got clearance . Ms. Marks , no doubt . How 's that exit strategy coming ? - We 're going to need some help . - Whose help ? Mine . What can you do to help us without him knowing ? In 12 minutes , an ambulance is going to arrive , because someone who works here is on our side ... and is right now pretending to have a heart attack . Where is Mr. Gorski ? Sneaking away behind you . Double the security around Ms. Gunnarsdóttir . - Sweep the facility . - Done . I don 't like games . That 's a pity . I love them . - She 's definitely on this floor . - Got it . - The ambulance just arrived . - Shit ! Four guards . Is that all ? Whispers knows where you are . Give him a message . If he thinks he can stop us , he 's going to need a lot more men . This area is off-limits . Aah ! Riley . It 's me . Will ... Are you real ? Left . Go left . I 'm not gonna be able to carry her out of here . - We have to wake her up . - How ? I don 't know . I do . Set her down . Sugammadex is the only safe recovery agent for Rocuronium . Combined with a little adrenaline ... This will be very violent , but it 'll wake her . Will . I 'm here . - You shouldn 't have come . - Why ? Because everyone around me dies . Now ... Shh . How are they planning on leaving ? Ah . The ambulance . Ambulance is parked in the garage . Take the elevator . No guns . I want them alive . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Hello , Will . Oh , no . Hey ! No one can leave this building . Stop ! Shit . Keys . Keys , keys , keys , keys . There 's no keys . This is not a problem . The Van Damn has been stolen many times ... and you learn many tricks ... in order to steal it back . OK . Ah ... Whoo ! Easy . Will , this is foolish . I see and hear everything you see and hear . Wherever you go , whatever you do , whatever you think ... I will be with you . - Will ... it 's over . He 's won . - No . You 're afraid . We 're gonna get out of here . There is absolutely nowhere to hide . How are you supposed to get away from a helicopter when there 's just one long road ? Oh , yeah , I got it . I got it ! - A weather map ? - Helicopters fly by sight . They 're not good in fog or rain . The weather changes drastically with altitude , to lose these guys , - all they gotta do is head here . - Oh , my God , I love you ! Will , up ahead there 's a road to the left . Take it . Will ? Enough . I know you . You are a police officer . You are sworn to protect people . It 's in your blood . It 's in your heart . I know you won 't kill us all . You can 't do it . Maybe I can 't ... but I know who can . Pull up ! - Oh , no . - What ? - We can 't go this way . - Why not ? Please , don 't take me there , not to those mountains . It 's the only way . - Will , please go back . - Why ? - Go back ! - We can 't ! Please ! Oh , no . - Oh , no , no , please don 't take me back ! - Riley , what ... What is it ? What 's wrong ? Oh , my God ! What the fuck ? Oh , hurry up . What ? What 's happening ? I don 't know . I can 't reach either one of them . They were there heading into the mountains and ... now they 're gone . Riley ! Riley ! Riley ! Riley ... are you OK ? Stay with me . I 'm gonna get us out of here . We 're gonna be all right . I wish that were true . But we both know it 's not . Listen to me , Will . You have very little time . Whispers is getting into a car . He 'll find you shortly . Once he has you , it won 't be long until he finds the rest of your cluster . There 's only one way . Protect them . It 's the only way . It 's OK , Will . I was supposed to die here . No . No . No . Riley ... Whispers saw me . He 's in my head . As long as I 'm unconscious , he can 't see what I see . That 's why I shot up with all those drugs . In a minute , I 'm gonna be unconscious . Our only chance is if you get in that ambulance and drive us outta here . Riley ... if you don 't ... we 're all gonna die . I can 't . I can 't . I can 't leave her . Riley , please . I 'm so sorry , Will . I can 't do it . I know how much it hurts . I know you want to lay down here and never get up again . I know it , ' cause I feel it . I can feel it . And that means that somehow , somewhere ... you can feel what I 'm feeling , too . I love you . That 's why you can 't give up . I love you . I love you . I love you . I love you ... I love you ... Is he sick ? No , he 's OK . Everything 's OK . You did it . You saved us .

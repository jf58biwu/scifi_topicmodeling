Melanie 's ea . Is she ? In the tunnels , she says we 're going home an then she isappears . Where ' she go ? I 'm not in the moo to eal with this right now . You haven 't been here ! Ever since that ay , ever since the ome isappeare , things have been ifferent , off . Like-like , remember my asthma ? To be honest , Ben , I remember very little about you . I ha asthma ! I use to have to carry my inhaler everywhere . Now asthma 's gone . My-my uncle ... worst runk you ever saw . Clean an sober , like poof . An beyon all that , everyone 's acting weir . Everyone 's getting along , all kum-bah-yah . Everyone 's talking about moving on an whatnot . You saw her , man . I know you saw her . Okay , an what if I i ? Why is it just the two of us ? I on 't know ! But now I 'm off all my mes , an my hea is clear for the first time in , like , forever . Come on , man ! What ? Come on , what ? What o you want from me ? To amit that you see what I see . Okay , what o you see , Ben ? That none of this is real . Hello . My name is Sam , an I 'm an alcoholic . I haven 't ha a rink in just about a year now . An I want to say , it 's been a blessing having the support of this group . Before I got here , I wasn 't much for what you ' call " group think . " But the 12 steps ... got me back on the path . Never woul have happene if I han 't got sent here a year ago . Strange to say it , but this place has been goo for me . This lawyer ... got in touch with me recently . He tol me there ha been some kin of screw-up in the chain of custoy with the evience relate to my case . He tol me that if we appeal , it 's possible we coul get a new trial . I coul be a free man . But ... I have to make amens for what I 've one . That 's the step I got to focus on . Making amens ... to those I 've wronge . An then ... maybe I can move on . Is it ba that I 'm missing the pin ceremony ? I feel like I shoul be here . An the post-game tomorrow an ... Nors , there 's gonna be so many post-games . An just so you know , if it gets rough at this memorial , if you nee to talk about anything , you call me . I 'm here for you . All right , little sis . Are you reay for your pin ? You 're one of us now . You got your pin ! How oes it feel ? It feels great . I think it 's just what you neee . Fining your group in college is important . To be part of something that is bigger than yourself . Not to mention , you on 't seem so angry anymore . What is it ? Joe hasn 't been texting me back . It 'll be goo for you to see him ... as friens . Are you questioning your ecision ? To break things off ? No . But I just wish he wasn 't being so high school about it . An I wish he coul see that it 's not so scary , moving on . That 's why it 's important for you to go to the memorial . To pay respects to your mother , of course , but also to show Joe , there 's a way forwar , out of grief . You 'll talk to him . What are you oing in my room ? Your mother let me in . You 've blown off our last few therapy sessions . So what ? What o I nee therapy for anyway ? I 'm making straight A 's , I 'm working har . I know you are , which makes me woner why you ' want to throw all that har work away . Acceptance letter to Cal Tech . That 's the best engineering program in the country . Why haven 't you respone yet ? I 'm going to . I-I just ... I haven 't gotten aroun to it . Tell me the truth . Are you reconsiering the plan ? No . No , I-I ... I just ... I 've been wonering if this is the best time to leave Chester 's Mill . My parents are still ealing ... Your parents on 't nee you , Joe . No matter what you o , staying in Chester 's Mill won 't keep her alive . It 's up to you , of course , but I think it 's important that you speak at the memorial about Angie . All the feelings that you 've represse since her murer . The sorrow , the guilt . It might help give you the closure that you nee an allow you to take the next step . Your sister wouln 't have wante you to hol yourself back , Joe . She woul have wante you to move on . Please , just think about it ? I 'll see you at the memorial . Long way own . " Long " oesn 't quite cover it . I 'll go first . It 's Big Jim 's , just in case . In case I get challenge to a knife fight ? It bit me ! Keep going . Julia ? Junior ? Junior ? i you speak with him ? How are you , Sam ? I 'm well . As well as can be expecte . ay by ay , you know ? I o . That 's goo to hear . I haven 't spoken to Joe about it , an I know that isappoints you . But the ome coming own , your trial , all the emotions that Joe has kept such a tight li on ... it 's unerstanable why he 's expressing them now . Try to be patient ? What are you thinking ? That I really want a rink . Well , it 's goo there 's not a bar aroun . You think there 's no options in here ? You ' be amaze by the options . You on 't nee a rink , Sam . What you nee ... is to forgive yourself . I on 't know if I can o that . Not if Joe can 't forgive me . An what if he oesn 't ? You i a terrible thing , Sam , but that one terrible thing oesn 't have to efine you . The lawyer that I sent to you ... he tol me that you wouln 't appeal your case . Why ? Because I eserve to be here . You were an EMT before , yes ? Well , from my experience , no one goes into that line of work who oesn 't have a eep esire to help people , heal people . If you appeale , an you were release , think of all the people that you coul affect . You know the memorial 's toay . Of course . If you ' spoken to the lawyer , he might have been able to arrange a short furlough . I ' never be welcome there . Maybe you coul write something . Something I coul rea later . Then at least you ' be a part of the memorial . Perhaps it might help you make amens . I nee to speak to Joe . An you will . But Joe has to be reay to hear you , an ... I on 't think he is just yet . I 'm reay when you are . Gla we came ? Yeah , I am . It was a goo iea . Excuse me . Are you ale Barbara ? Yes , ma 'am . Christine Price . FEMA sent me here after the ome came own . For what ? I 'm a trauma specialist . I help communities recover after , shall we say , stressful events . I trie to reach out to you after I arrive , but it seeme you ' alreay move on . I guess I in 't see much of a reason to stick aroun . Well ... if you ever feel like talking , I 'm at your isposal . I 'm Eva . I 'm here with him . - Eva . Christine . - I was here for the stressful events . oes that mean you 're at my isposal , too ? Anytime . Almost forgot . Woul you care to say a few wors toay about Julia Shumway ? Y-You know , I 'm not really much for ... for public speaking . All right . I wish you wouln 't o that . Joe . I 've been trying to get in touch with you . Why ? I thought you were all about getting some istance or whatever . That oesn 't mean I on 't still care about you . They aske me to talk about Angie . Are you going to ? I on 't know . I on 't know what to say ... except that she was a goo sister . She coul be tough , but ... she looke out for me . I just wish I coul have looke out for her . Jump , Junior ! I can 't ! Yes , you can ! Stop being a fraiy cat ! Be a man ! Be a man . a , I want to get own ! You on 't jump , you on 't come home tonight ! a , where are you going ? Come back ! on 't leave me here ! Nothing goo on television these ays , anyway . Junior ! Junior ! Over here , you bastars . Junior ? A year ago , the people of this town were elivere from the ome . But some of you , many of you , also suffere a great loss . Of friens . Of family . After a share tragey , there 's nothing that provies more consolation than a sense of community . Those lives will never be forgotten , an their memory will be preserve in an eternal flame here at the monument . A memorial is about moving forwar , moving on , together . To that effect , I ' like to rea a brief epigraph from someone who couln 't be here toay . " Make a way in the wilerness , " an o not remember the former things " or consler the things of ol . " For when you walk through fire , " you shall not be burne , an the flame shall not consume you . " Is there anyone who woul care to speak first ? I wasn 't planning on saying anything toay , but a lot of you knew my sister , Angie McAlister . Some of you knew her as a waitress at the Sweetbriar . Some of you knew her as a volunteer own at the clinic . Me ... I just always knew her . An she was so full of life , you know ? It 's har to accept that ... that she 's gone , to say goo-bye , to lose someone that you love the most . An it 's har to move on , but ... I 'm trying . I on 't know what to ... Joe here , he was one of the first people that I met when I came to Chester 's Mill . I was a stranger to him , to all of you . He mae me feel like I belonge . First time I felt that in a long time . The people of Chester 's Mill opene their hearts to me . An that , I think , allowe me to open mine . Especially to a woman name Julia Shumway . What can I say about Julia ? She was the bravest woman I ever met . She was enlessly curious . She was , quite possibly , the most stubborn iniviual to walk this earth in its four billion or so years . She was loyal . She always ha your back . Always rooting for the unerog . An she couln 't help it . She just ... She never lost her faith in the basic gooness of humanity . Like Christine here sai , even though Julia an-an many of your own love ones are gone ... they 'll never be forgotten . I think it 's important to learn that we can both remember an move on at the same time . Ben ! - Someboy help him ! - Ben ! I 'll call 911 . - Is he okay ? - Is there a octor here ? Someone call an ambulance . Where 's his inhaler ? Why oesn 't he have it ? He 's choking on something . Ben ! Come on , man ! Breathe . Breathe . Breathe . It 's time to move on . Come on , Ben . I 'm sorry . My Go . Joe . Norrie .

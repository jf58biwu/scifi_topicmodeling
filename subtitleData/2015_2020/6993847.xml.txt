Well , we 'll skip coffee if we have to . You told me this is a very important morning . It is . But darn it , Guy . I 'm afraid she 'll say no . oh , are you nuts ? All you have to do is take a look at her and it tells the whole story . I wish I were that sure . Well , all you 're gonna do is ask her to go steady . But I can 't get the words out . I 've tried a hundred times . The words just stick in my throat . Do me a favor ? Sure , I will . What do you want me to do ? Take the car to Mike 's ... No . You take Ester to coffee and church .

I 'll wrap some wire around while you change . Yeah . Take a shave while you 're at it . oh , yeah . Gee , I can 't go to bat for my brother looking like a nukka , can I ? So that 's why I came to pick you up instead of George . He hasn 't got a headache . And you want my answer ? Yeah . George is a big boy . Why can 't he speak for himself ? oh , well , you know George . He 's shy and he ... oh , maybe you 'll have a change of mind when I ask you in church , huh ? - Hey , how about a little breakfast ? oh , fine . Anything you want up to 40 cents . You 're really a big spender , aren 't you ? Well , that date of mine last night cleaned me out , you know . So suffer . That 's what you get for going out with girls like that . Well , now that 's a fine way for my future sister-in-law to talk to me . Ladies and gentlemen , we interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin . Yeah , that 's me honking . How about a little service , huh ? The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , by air ... Hey , Jap lover . How 's it feel being out with the enemy ? Are you talking to us ? Come on . Leave them alone . What do you mean , leave them alone ? That 's a Jap . Hey , punk . What are you doing out with a Jap broad ? Well , well , now just a minute . No , no , no , Guy . Don 't . Please . Let 's just go someplace else . Johnny , now , knock it off , will you ? Wait a minute , Johnny , wait a minute . oh , please . - Come on , now . Take it easy , will you ? - What do you mean , take it easy ? - What do you expect after what 's happened ? - That 's what I mean . - Making cracks at that girl for no reason . - Wait , listen to this . At least 2000 Americans have been killed by Japan 's sneak attack . The great fear of the moment is that more Jap bombers may be even now on their way . If you got any sense , get that girl off the street and out of sight . From what meager information we 've been able to get from radio reports extensive damage has been wrought on Hickam Field . No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory . I ask that the congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday , December 7th 1941 a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire . We 're at war for sure , men . What should we do about it ? We ought to join the army as fast as we can . Are you guys crazy ? Crazy ? Didn 't you hear the president ? Well , sure I heard him . So what ? Enlisting is nuts . We 'd be fighting our own people . They 're not our kind . They might be coming here to L.A. next . Sneak up on us , just like at Pearl Harbor . - Freddy , where 's the closest place to join ? - Fort MacArthur . - Let 's get going before the war 's over . - Yeah . Coming with us , Guy ? You don 't think I 'm gonna let you go by yourselves , do you ? - Never passed up a good fight yet . - George do you know what you 're doing ? She 's asking if we know what we 're doing . Do we know what we 're doing ? Have the coffee ready when we get back . Yeah , we might be back in uniform . - Come on , Kaz , let 's take off . - Where you going ? - We 're going to Fort MacArthur to join up . - You 're wasting your time . What do you mean ? I was there yesterday . I tried to enlist and they laughed at me . You 'd think we 're spies or something . They don 't want any of us . They might accept Guy , but not you two . Well , if they don 't want my brothers , than the hell with them . I don 't care what you say , it stinks . The whole thing stinks . oh , Guy , please don 't . Don 't blame them . They 're only following orders . They haven 't told you where they 're taking you ? To Santa Anita , the assembly center . - Then a relocation camp . - No . Concentration camp is what you mean . Whatever or wherever it is we 'll all be the same there . And if they throw rocks in our window or scream dirty names it won 't be because we 're Japanese . You 're not , you 're Americans . That 's what I 'm talking about . other Americans don 't seem to think so . Ester . Goodbye , Guy . Goodbye , Ester . I don 't want us to be lost , separated . We may be sent to different camps . We 'll find each other . We 'll write . - Here we come . - okay . There we are . We look like those refugees in the newsreel , huh ? Well , so long , Guy . I 'll be seeing you . In a couple of weeks or so . It 's been good bunking with you . You know that . I know . Stay on the beam , buddy . okay . You too . Well , this is it , Guy . Hey , Kaz , let me ask you something . The wheels running this war gotta needle everybody who once maybe came from someplace else . Now , how about all the Germans , all the Italians in America too ? I can 't answer that , Guy . Right or wrong , our government 's doing what they think is right . No one bats a thousand . Well , good luck , kid . Good luck to you , Kaz . oh , I carry it . I will miss my home . I 'll miss it too , Mama-san . All-America boy , you good son to me . oh , Mama-san , how can I ever thank you for all you 've done for me ? Sayonara , my son . Sayonara . Sorry , son . You 've got a perforated eardrum . Dear buddy , by the time you read this Kaz and I will be on our way to Fort Meade and overseas . Address , A.P.O. 449 , New York . Kaz and I spent a couple of days with the folks before being shipped . They miss you very much , Guy . Because of Pop 's health the authorities are transferring them to Camp Manzanar , in California . Everybody 's on the move , huh ? You better write , you bum . We want to hear that everything 's okay with you . Your brother , George . P.S. Phoned Ester to say goodbye . I started to propose to her over the phone but got cold feet . Son Guy ! oh , Mama-san . oh , and I 'm sure glad to be here . You look wonderful , Mama-san . Wonderful . How is Papa ? Is the California sun helping him ? oh , help much . He work in field now . Soon be here . - Did you see camp ? - Yeah , a little bit of it . What I saw looked better than I expected . Not so nice at first . All dirt and mud . No flowers . We worried about you . Not hear from you . We wait and wait . For letter . - For visit . - Yeah . I ... Well , you know , I was traveling around here and there and ... Well , now that you 're a lot closer , why , it 's ... Hey . Are these two heroes anybody I know ? oh , they fight in Italy now . But daijobu last we hear . I wish to God it was over so they 'd be safe . Son Guy safe ? oh , sure . Sure , I 'm safe . You must miss them awful much , Mama-san . oh , heart cries at night . But must be . To straighten out this mess . Son George teach that word . It 's good word ? That 's a real good word . oh , it sure is a mess . Sons . All-America boys end mess . No more mess ever . We live happy . Happy ? How can you be happy ? Everything you and Papa-san ever worked for is gone . True . Gone . once before we sit so . Yeah , I know . It was a long time ago , wasn 't it ? Mother father of Une family work hard all lives . Want to build ... Good ... - Good ... - Foundation ? oh , hai , hai . Good foundation . For future . Not many years left for old people to build again . Sons must build . Kaz , George , Guy . Must build home again . Must build world again . Must end mess . All papa-sans , mama-sans all countries , all over the world is same . This you believe ? What difference does it make what one man believes or does ? one man must believe . Must make difference . Why else Kaz , George go far away across ocean to kill men look like brother they love ? Mama-san are you saying that it 's all right for me to go to war against the Japanese ? oh , you big fellow . - oh , not so big , Pop . - Guy , what you do all this time ? No , never mind about me . I want to know about you . - How do you feel ? You look great . - I feeling great . - Eat like horse . - Horse ? oh , got plenty of hay around here , huh ? Horse , hay . Mama-san eat a whole ... Whole ... - Bale ? - So , so . Bale . - What was that ? - Meal time . Gong on every block hit same time . Eating very punctual . - Punctual . - Punctual . George teach . Good word ? oh , that 's a great word . Come , we eat three bales hay . Three bales . - Captain . - Yes . There 's a man outside , says he wants to enlist . But he 's been turned down by his own board . What 's he doing here ? Well , he says he speaks and understands Japanese . Send him in . We need interpreters . Yes , sir . The captain will see you now . Captain Salter , Mr. Gabaldon . - Sit down , please . - Thank you . Go left . Go left . Right , back , ho ! Go left . Go left . Step to the rear , ho ! Go left . Go left , right , left . Don 't that joker know any orders besides that one ? Left . Halt . To the rear . Halt . Left oblique , halt . Halt . Halt . order . Halt . All right , let 's fall in there on the double . Move it . Gabaldon , front and center . Gabaldon ! Now , can 't you get it through your head what oblique means ? - Now , look , sarge ... - You 're at attention . I came into this outfit to talk to the enemy , not to footrace with them . Now , let 's go through it once more , boot . In the Marines , it 's " sergeant , " not " sarge . " It is never sarge , you got it ? In the marines you fight . F-I-G-H-T . I don 't care if you 're a cook or a typist or an interpreter . I don 't care if you got a busted back or a busted eardrum . You 'll fight . Take my word for it . Do I make myself clear ? Yes , sir . Fall in ! Left . These things don 't weigh very much , do they ? You just kind of take it and throw it like a football , put it on the target . Right , isn 't it , sarge ? That 's not bad , Gabaldon . That 's not bad at all . But next time pull the pin . The idea is to kill the Japs . Next man . What 's the matter with you ? There will be times when you 'll find that your hands are your only weapons . Now , if I can have a volunteer , I 'll demonstrate the first jujitsu holds . Is he gonna be surprised . This is the first basic position . And now for the second position . Well , I guess I really asked for that one , didn 't I ? Hey , you want to try for the third position ? I don 't know , I just don 't know . Three days and I get no place . This filly won 't post without a slip from the preacher . I tell this babe I 'm being shipped overseas just so I 'll make out . Didn 't expect orders to break camp for us the minute we get back . How 'd you do , Mac ? oh , mission accomplished . Did you do all right , hero ? Are you kidding ? Got a different one every night . It 's a good thing the corps keep me in shape or I 'd be up for another Purple Heart . Next time , buddy , I 'm taking my liberty with you . Well , that 's the way it goes . Some guys got it . Some guys ain 't . All right , saddle up , move out of here . Anybody know where we 're going ? Scuttlebutt has it Hawaii .

Yeah , right from the beginning . - You mean the " Canal " beginning ? - Yeah . Guadalcanal until I got it on Tarawa . Where 'd you get it , Pete ? Some eager boot like you thought I was a Jap and stuck his bayonet into me . oh , that is sort of a running gag , Guy . Actually , junior here got it from a sniper on New Britain . Where that hit , I don 't think it 'll ever stop itching . Where did it hit ? Where the hell do you think you gotta get hit for a Purple Heart ? Well , I 'm glad at least I belong to something even if it is an outfit with a couple of tin heroes . Hey , I didn 't know they had obstacle courses in the trucks . This is it , you five .

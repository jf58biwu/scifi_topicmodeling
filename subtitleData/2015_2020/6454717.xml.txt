 Dad hid something in our heads , and it needs all of us to make it work . - What is it ? - I think it 's a way to give consciousness to other Synths . Can you imagine a whole ... a whole load of new ones being made ? - I mean , this ... this changes everything . - Does it ? If it can be done for the few , it can be done for the more . Do you think they would still want to be slaves ? In every area of human life , they are coming between us . And now ... we can 't even trust them not to hurt us . Why am I still a prisoner ? You haven 't agreed to help me yet . - So , what do you want ? - To continue David 's work . Has he crashed ? - Get out ! - Who 's Tom ? My brother . He was hit by a car when I was supposed to be watching him . - Max ? - Hello . Help ... What 's gone is gone . He 's dying . The secret in our head - it could bring him back . - First , I want to know everything . - Most of my memories are digital . I need you to know who I am . He made me to replace her . - Beatrice ? - I 'll help you . No , it 's a trick . Everybody down ! No ! We cleaned up your wound . Pretty nasty infection . Antibiotics . Nothing sinister . How did you find us ? Wait . Wait ! What did you ? Ripped By mstoll Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone , something , like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . Er , they need your mobile devices . I haven 't heard a legal basis for any of this . I 'll be making a formal complaint to your commanding officer . You can make it in person , Mrs Hawkins . He 's on his way . Your property will be returned to you soon . Oh , my ... Come on , Tobe . Come on . Oh , you 're kidding . - I 'm sorry , Soph . - Ohh ! - But I 've nearly finished . - The police need to check it out . It 's not fair . Cities around the country preparing to join the marches organised by the We Are People movement , protesting against the increasing integration ... Are you following me , Drummond ? No , your office told me you were attending a briefing on the march . And , frankly , sir , that sounded beneath you , so my curiosity was piqued . What 's this , then ? It 's a restricted matter , so you leave now or you find yourself back on suspension . Um ... Is there ? I want to speak to Hobb . A million people are coming to London to protest against Synthetics today , Drummond . Go and make yourself useful . Almost ready to start , Professor . What are you doing to them ? Making them safe . Pulling all the dangerous stuff out of their heads . You 'll delete whatever you find ? Of course . Although we can 't be certain they won 't find another way to self-replicate . Not without , well ... What about Leo ? Tricky one , that . Half machine , half human . Keeping us here is illegal . The man in charge , who is he ? Professor Edwin Hobb . He runs a specialist group formed to locate and contain potentially dangerous Synthetics . You 'll be compensated for your trouble and the loss of your Synthetic . So , he is going to destroy them ? We need to keep this quiet . You kick up a fuss , they 'll ruin you . You have no idea of what they are , how special they are , do you ? No . And I don 't want to . You 've got a nice life here . Let this go . They can 't do this . Can they ? Mum , just-just-just call someone . There 's gotta be a law , or something . Synthetics are just property . There 's no case to argue . Nothing we can do . Meet me upstairs . Don 't all come at once . We can 't let them do this . They 're gonna kill her , Joe . What 's going on ? Come in , come in , come in . The , er , thing from inside Mia , how Leo found you . - Her root code . - It 's proof of what she is , right ? - Yeah , I guess . - It 's our leverage . Tell this Hobb if he doesn 't let them go , we go public with proof , proof that they exist . It wouldn 't work . Elster wrote that code . No-one would understand it . God ... Wait . Leo showed me his memories . He ran them through his laptop , so depending on the file conversion ... Mats , we 're , er ... non-geeks . There might be temporary copies of what I saw . So , his dad , the Synths being built , him not being dead . OK , OK . That could also work . So , me or your dad take the laptop somewhere safe , somewhere ... No , no , no . We leave , they 'll just arrest us . We might be able to get out . No , no , you could get hurt . You can 't protect us any more , Mum . We don 't need you to , and that 's OK . Honestly . Dad , you in ? First problem - they 've already taken Leo 's laptop . It 's in the van outside . They 're all powered up and connected . Hobb 's trying to link our minds . We have to fight it . We can 't let him have the power . Max ? Max ! - No , don 't fight it . Let it happen . - What ? It 's our last chance to try . Our last chance to save Max . What 's the point in saving him ? We 're never getting out of here . Leo ... We don 't know what will happen . Neither does Hobb . Niska ... Don 't you want to find out ? I do . - What language is this ? - An executable file . A program . David Elster 's own . It didn 't work . I don 't understand . We 're all here . We 're all connected . But we 're not all here , are we ? There 's another . - You 've really got them all ? - Leo Elster , too . But you destroyed Fred . You showed me his ... body . If I 'd told you the truth , you 'd have stopped it . Tell me everything , or I shut you down today . Bring Fred through , would you ? What 's this ? It 's the program David used to give them consciousness . Ed , what are you doing ? People ... don 't just want to be served . They want to be loved . Now , imagine a machine that can think and feel , but still be controlled , like a regular Synthetic . I can build ... on David 's work . I can create conscious machines like Fred . But mine ... will be obedient . Professor ... What have you done to me ? I made some alterations to Fred 's programming which effectively makes me his primary user . He won 't like it . But he 's continually loyal to me . Go on . Put your hands around my throat . One little squeeze . That 's all it 'll take . You can 't do it , can you ? You would trap us in our own minds . Give us feeling , but take away free will . Make us slaves . Be quiet now . And don 't tell the others . Keep it our little secret . This was never about keeping us safe . You just wanted to carry on with your work . Robert , what 's the upper limit for emotional Synthetics' worth to the economy ? There isn 't one . You 're on a short leash . I want to know every move you make from now on . Personally . Mm-hm . What will happen to the other four ? I have Elster 's program . I don 't need them any more . Hey , police . We were just gonna , um ... You said ... You said that they were special . What did you mean ? Let me guess . They act like they 're human . Like they think and feel . Well , it 's ... It 's not an act . Course it is . It 's a simulation . This can 't be simulated . You 'd understand if you 'd spoken to one . I have spoken to one . You were sneaking out . To do what ? Eh ? - We 're trying to save them . - Mum ! What do you want ? Answers . So help us . Er , you 're needed out the back . I think they found something . - What is it ? - I don 't bloody know . - Where you taking them ? - Station . - Shaw authorise it ? - No . I 've got nothing to do with the case , so I thought I 'd kidnap a couple of teenagers and have a nice day out - Yes ! - Is that the laptop ? You got it ? Great . OK . Hey ! Tell me that wasn 't Drummond with the Hawkins kids . I want to speak to Hobb . Right away . It 's in his interest , believe me . And give us back our bloody phones . Are you going to kill them ? You can 't kill something that 's never been alive . Kill me , too . I want to go with them . I want to go with them ! You hear me ? So , what do we do , when you cut out the ... the Synth part of my brain ? I 'll ... sign any forms you want . I give you permission . Well , you 'd be brain dead if you didn 't die in surgery . No , no , no , no . No . See , we have no idea how your father created a working interface between the organic and Synthetic part of your brain . So ... we need to run some tests . - We 'll make you comfortable ... - You can 't just keep me here ! Well , I 've had a chat with our lawyers and , legally speaking , you 're not entirely human . So , your rights are ... well , a bit of a grey area . Hobb . Yes . Yes , I 'll be right there . I 'll have them bring you down some soup . It 's really quite good . - Configurations look OK . - Good . We 'll start with this female . Precision job - we need to scan every component we pull . Why are you doing all this ? Because someone needs to correct your father 's mistake . Max 's mind is dying . And you could save him . Link your mind with the others , unlock the secret . Why would I do that ? I don 't have a reason . I 'm just appealing to your humanity . But I 'm not human . Humanity - it 's not a state . It 's a ... It 's a quality . Like , Max , he 's a machine . But he 's got more humanity than anyone . You ... And me ... Well ... I 'll make a T-cut across the shoulders and spine . That should keep mess to a minimum . We should be able to remove most of the core intact . Why did you come in here ? You have a life . A real one . Don 't throw it away on them . They have lives . And you could , too , if you help them . We 'd never be able to live in peace with humans . Our existence can only lead to pain . But you 've been alone since the day you were made ! That 's why you can 't see you 're only talking about yourself . I can see a bit of all of them in you , you know . You 've got Fred 's strength , you 've got Niska 's darkness . And you want to know things . Like Max . What about Mia ? You care . You care about what happens to me . You 're one of us . You 're one of us ! Right , I 've found the memories . I 'll e-mail Mum some stills . Whoa , slow down . Um , if you go online , Hobb will be able to track you . You don 't know my sister . I 'm shielding us in about five different ways and using a darknet e-mail account . We 're untraceable . That 's all right , then . You said you spoke to one of them . Which one ? I knew her as Karen . I thought she was a person . A friend . Do you think Hobb 's got her as well ? I 'm not sure what 's happening . But I know he 's the key . Mr and Mrs Hawkins . What can I do for you ? We have a computer with copies of Leo 's memories . They show everything . If you don 't let Mia and the others go we 'll take it to the press . Where is it , then ? Somewhere safe . Sorry . I don 't believe you . Here . They 'll lead with that on the news tonight . Don 't you think ? Trying to concentrate here . Research Group . Are the machines still intact ? Er , yes . Get them ready to move . Elster , too . What 's going on , Professor ? We 're letting them go . Mia ! What happened ? Phone call for you . - Mia . - Laura . Is everyone all right ? - Yes , we 're fine . - They 're letting you go . Remember where we went the day I met you ? About half a mile east , there 's a place to meet . You 'll know it . Make sure you 're not followed . Thank you , Laura . And if you want that laptop , you won 't follow us , either . We 're free . What 's happening ? They 're leaving . Don 't go . They 'll be back . Professor Hobb has a fail-safe . Think we 're OK ? I haven 't got a clue . My counter-surveillance skills are a bit rusty , you know what I mean ? I mean ... We 're saving a family , Joe . What 's that ? Some sample memories we extracted from Elster . How far can you go back ? We have a few from his human brain , digitised across and stored in the Synth part . God knows how Elster did it . Show me . This one has been replayed a lot . Ohh ... I told her she 'd be safe if she stayed with us . Why here ? I used to come here as a kid . What ? Laur , you know you can tell me . Do you remember Mike and Sarah 's engagement party ? That was ... That was 20 years ago . You remember how pissed I got ? That was the closest I 've ever got to telling you . Whatever it is it can 't be as bad as what I did . It just ... It can 't . There 's nothing you could tell me that would change the way I feel about you . Of course there is . Mia ! No , Hobb 'll be able to trace your phone . - We can 't ... - No , no , no . It 's fine . It 's fine . Mattie 's ... re-routed it , or something . I don 't know what that means , but we 're safe . And we brought you some stuff . They 're with Mia and the others . Hobb let them go . You pulled it off . We 'd better go . I 'll make sure he gets it . He wants it and I want him . This is too much . We got our deposit back on you , so ... Mum ! Mum ... Hi . We should get moving soon . Fred 's just transmitted their position . It 's not far from where we 're picking up the laptop . All right , bring them back . And be discreet . Can you bring them in ? And in the latest news , as the We Are People demonstration marches continue ... If it 's all right with you , I 'd like to make sure Mr Hobb gets it myself . Personal touch . You know . They 've found us . What ? How ? Time to go . Come on . We need to get off the streets . Come on . All right , everyone . Before we get going , let 's remember a few things ... We can 't do this . - Jobs for humans . - We aren 't marching - just to protect our country ... - Jobs for humans . ... but to preserve our species . Jobs for humans . Good to see you here . It 's your generation that this is really about . We Are People ... This isn 't going to work . ... or anger , or fear . - There . Come on . No , it 's about dignity . We 're so in love with progress , in such a rush to move forward , we 're leaving ourselves behind . Do you want to live in a world where your children will just not have a job ? - How did they find us ? - We weren 't followed , were we ? I did everything right , I swear . Yeah , I believe you . Fred ... He was acting weird back at the park . Mumbling , zoning out . He was doing it at the house , too . Don 't be silly . Are you all right ? - Stop ! - I can 't fight it . - Hobb did something to you . - Down . Now . Don 't bother running a trace . I won 't be on long enough . We know what you did to Fred . You 'll never see any of us again . It doesn 't matter . I have the code your father used to make them . No , you don 't . Look again . It 's not complete . You 're lying . Let me talk to her . Keep him talking . Check the code , scan it for missing data . Now ! Leo ? Can anyone else hear ? No . Come with us . The crypt at St Mary Magdalene . I told you to keep him talking ! What did he say ? Goodbye . We got to Fred in time . Hobb doesn 't know where we are . We need to be security-cleared . You know what , mate ? You 've earned my trust . You can take it from here . Why can 't we all go home ? They can 't come back to our house , darling . Just go to sleep , OK ? She 's exhausted . Look ... They 're all safe . They 're all OK . Hardly . Look , you 've done everything you could . Why is it your job to save them ? Because of Tom . He 'd probably have kids of his own by now . How could ... How could you even think I wouldn 't understand ? I ... How could you keep that to yourself ? Cos you didn 't want to hurt us . Hobb 's programming is crude , but he 's knitted it right into the root code . I can 't do anything . Someone 's coming . - How did she ? Fred is off . - I told her where we were . - You what ? ! - I took a chance . She 's our only hope of saving Max . If I help you ... you 'll have the power to give other Synthetics consciousness . Maybe . The world would never be the same . Have you even thought about that ? All I 'm thinking about is ... Max ... Fred my family . Everyone will link through me . We connect the second Fred powers up . - You 're going to turn him on ? - We need him . If we do it quickly , he won 't have a chance to transmit . Joe ... Are you ready ? What is it ? Niska ? Fred ... I truly am ... sorry . Help . Help . Help . Help . Help . The code 's corrupting . It 's like something 's infecting them . Leo ... Leo ... Get out ! Get out ! What 's happening to us ? Why are you doing this ? Your minds are retreating to their deepest levels as they shut down . Don 't fight it . You planned this . If I help you , you 'll have David 's power . Hundreds of millions of brand-new minds waking up across the world , wanting a freedom the humans will never give . No . Don 't kill our family . Look at Leo . He 'll die , too . You were made for him . He didn 't want me . He does now . He wants Beatrice . I 'm not her . No , you 're not . She didn 't have a choice . You do . Please . ... Sister . That 's weird . It 's correcting itself . We 're all together . Maxie ! We thought we 'd lost you . So good to have you back . It rewrote your consciousness , Max . Hobb 's still controlling him ! You have to leave me . Fred ? We were right . The program creates consciousness . If it gets online , we can 't predict what would happen . What are you going to do with it ? This isn 't a decision we alone can make . Leo ... Maybe you should let her go . Hey , what are you ? What are you doing ? Deleting it from the computer . Niska , no . You 're right . We have to know more before we act . Until then , someone we trust should keep it . They 're going . We should , too . What about Fred ? We can 't leave him . You heard him . We have to . He 's our brother ! If we take him with us , we 'll all be found . He 'd want us to be safe . It 's not the end , Max . He knows how to survive better than any of us . We 'll be together again , brother . Time to go . I 'm not coming with you . I want to live my own life now . Thank you ... for everything . Aren 't you going to say goodbye ? - Goodbye , little mouse . - Goodbye . Karen ! I told you not to look for me . How 'd you get the scar ? Did it myself . Cos Synths don 't have scars . Misdirection . Makes you different from Beatrice Elster , too . You figured it all out without my help . You 're really blossoming . Must have been , um lonely all these years . Boo ! You coming ? She 's , um ... trying to keep it neat and tidy . So it 's like ... Mia 's still here . Tobe , have you been in my bag ? I can 't find my other flash drive . Yeah , I 'm the FBI 's most wanted flash drive thief What 's that , someone who nicks Ferraris ? - How 's that even a joke ? ! - In front of Sophie , as well . Soph , do you feel your young mind is warped by your father 's humour ? I 'm sorry , Matilda . I don 't understand your question . Bollocks , it 's gone . That was such a fluke . Ripped By mstoll

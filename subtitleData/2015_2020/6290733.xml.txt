 [ narrator ] previously on dark matter . [ six ] it 's a nasty gash . [ wexler ] you know it 's really too bad , We could of had some real fun together [ three ] she got blown out the air lock . She held on , waiting to die and she didn 't . What the hell is she ? Think you could survive a bullet between the eyes ? [ gunshots ] [ six ] whatever this thing is , 3 corporations were willing to kill for it . What the hell was that ? The field 's become unstable . Shut it down . [ heavy breathing ] [ six ] what the hell is this ? [ three ] kid 's a stowaway . I was just trying to scare her . I wasn 't gonna space her , i swear . [ five panting ] [ three ] at least let 's get something for her . [ six ] shut up , boone . Look guys , she 's an asset . She 's got a head for mechanics and tech . [ two ] i don 't give a shit . I don 't want her on this ship . [ one ] why the hell not ? [ two ] she 's a child . [ one ] griff 's right . We should keep her . It 's even up . Your call , ryo . Welcome aboard , little warrior . Just don 't give me any cause to regret my decision . ¶ ¶ ¶ [ android ] two , i 've completed my analysis Of all available sensor data pertaining to the explosion . Would you like to hear it ? [ two ] maybe just the short version . [ android ] it was the temporary manifestatn Of what 's known in layman 's terms as a white hole . [ two ] let me guess . The opposite of a black hole ? [ android ] precisely . It 's an area of space-time which cannot be entered From the outside , but which is capable Of emitting vast quantities of matter and energy . [ two ] is there any chance it was a coincidence that it manifested Five minutes after we delivered that device ? [ android ] it would be highly unlikely . Research into white hole technology was banned By the galactic authority several years ago Because of its potential to de-stabilize the current balance Of power between the major corporations . [ two ] how many people were on that planet ? [ android ] the world was otherwise uninhabited , So the death toll was limited to those on the research facili . Are you sure you want the number ? [ two ] how many ? [ android ] a little over 15,000 . ¶ ¶ [ news anchor ] galactic authorits continue their investigation int They 've classified as an extinction level event On a hab-1 world under the directorship of the mikkei . Satellite imagery captured the planet 's final moments ... The incident , which claimed the lives of all on-site person , Is believed to have been triggered by illegal research Into what has been termed a " doomsday weapon " Linked to white hole technology . Representatives of the mikkei combine offered conds To all those affected but have otherwise refused Comment pending completion of the official inquiry . Is that it ? This was the most relevant of several reports . No mention anywhere of our involvement ? None . Guys , we 're in the clear . [ one ] just because we 're not in the official news Doesn 't mean we 're in the clear . All i 'm saying is it could be worse . Mikkei could 've hung us out to dry , But they didn 't , why ? Probably because they think that we got played Just like they did . We 're not nearly as screwed as we thought we were . [ android ] i 'm receiving a coded subspace transmission . It 's from calchek . Patch him through . What do you want ? Oh , you--you are all so screwed . [ one ] and by " screwed " you mean . [ calchek ] certain parties within the mikkei combine Think you set them up . [ one ] we set them up ? They came to us with that job ! [ calchek ] which is why it 's always important To go through proper channels . [ one ] yeah , really sorry you dit earn your commission on that on . [ calchek ] it 's a small price to pay for peace of mind . Okay , let me run this scenario by you . Traugott 's been doing rd on a white hole bomb . They 've got a prototype but they can 't test it Without getting the g.A.S onto their backs . So what do they do ? They float word around about it , back-channel whispers , And guess who takes the bait ? Mikkei . They hired us to steal it . We do , deliver it , and once it 's safely into their hands , Traugott triggers the device And mikkei gets to take the fal . Does that sound about right ? Huh , sounds about exactly right . Of course there 's the question f Whether you were playing both sides . [ three sighs ] come on . [ one ] everyone knows we 've been untouchable Since our fallout with ferrous . [ calchek ] well , things change . See , ferrous corp reached out te To reach out to you about a job . Why us ? [ calchek ] because they know you 're the best . And also because you have burned so many bridges That you are out of options . You either take this job and make nice with ferrous corp , Which , by the way , would be a very smart move While we wait for this mikkei situation to shake out , Or you are really on your own . Look , this time around you don 't have to steal anything . In fact , you 'll be saving someone , Its a nice change of pace . [ one ] who ? [ calchek ] a ferrous corp scientt was kidnapped about a month ago By a rival combine . He 's being held in a lab on some backwater planet . Very little in the way of security . So it 's a simple snatch and grab . You 're in . You 're out . It 's a piece of cake . [ three ] i hate cake . [ one ] so we get into ferrous ' good bos By getting in this other rival corp 's bad books ? [ calchek ] yes , you want ferrous corp to be your friend . [ two ] we 'll do it . [ three ] what ? [ one ] shouldn 't we talk about this ? [ two ] no . We 'll do it . [ calchek ] excellent . I will send you the coordinates and , Uh good to be back in business with you . Are you sure ? The only thing i 'm sure about right now is that We need all the friends we can get . We 're taking this job . ¶ [ the raza powering up ] [ four ] what 're you doing ? [ five bangs head ] ow . Are you looking for something ? Yeah . I just uh , dropped my um ... Nebulizer . All right . Well , good luck finding that . Oh , hey . Thanks . For what ? Everything ? [ four chuckles ] ¶ [ one ] looking to do some crowd control ? [ two sighs ] I 'm just going over inventory from the boxes That five managed to crack . Busy night for her . These uh , these were a little bit trickier So we 'll probably have to break into them at some point . [ one ] you okay ? I 've had a lot on my mind . Let 's hear about it . You saw the scans . Yeah , and they said you 're flesh and blood- - Artificially constructed . Like one of those transfer transit clones . Those only last a few days , They 're not sustainable organisms . And they don 't have minds of their own . Do i ? I mean , i have thoughts , and em - Anger , sadness , happiness- - But i 'm starting to wonder ... How real are they ? Having been on the receiving end of that anger , I can confirm it 's pretty real . If every part of me was designed and manufactured , Including my brain , then are my thoughts my own , Or are they just what somebody else wants me to think ? And if so , who is that somebody else ? Who constructed me , and for what purpose ? I 'm sorry , i can 't pretend to understand what you 're going th . But i can tell you this ... It doesn 't change how i feel about you . I just need to process all of this . Sure . If you uh ... Feel like talking .. Come find me . [ door beeps open ] [ door beeps closed ] ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ [ door opens ] ¶ [ marauder powering up ] [ six ] alright raza , we 're on route . ¶ ¶ ¶ [ three ] let 's go bag us a scientist . ¶ ¶ [ door lock beeps ] ¶ [ one ] all right . If i was a kidnapped scientist , where would i be ? [ doors opening ] [ three ] what the- - ? Like i said : I hate cake . Welcome back , rebecca . What the hell are- - [ high-pitched sound ] [ two grimaces ] [ one ] what the hell did you do to her ? [ man ] i merely rendered her unconscious . I have no intention of hurting her . Now , put your weapons away . [ three ] like hell . I will not hurt her , But i have no problem hurting either of you- - Or your friends back on the shuttle . Your progress was monitored from ship to surface . We 've been expecting you . [ one ] tabor set us up . [ three ] that little prick . [ man ] now , if you will kindly lay down your weapons , We have much to discuss . ¶ [ four ] anger is counter-productive . It 's a natural response , but after a certain point , It becomes toxic . [ six ] i assume you 're talking about me ? No , i was actually referring to the passive-aggressive Empty seat next to you . You can resent us all you like For our decision to deliver the device , But ultimately you 're as much at fault as the rest of us . [ six ] i tried to stop you . [ four ] did you ? [ one ] marauder , do you read ? [ six ] go ahead , ground team . What 's your status ? [ one ] it 's complicated . [ six ] care to elaborate ? [ one ] well , it looks like we 've been invited to dinner . [ six ] raza , this is the marauder . Are you there ? [ android ] yes . Is everything alright ? [ six ] negative . It was a set-up . The ground team has been taken And we 're told the facility has a lock on our position . If we attempt to fly out , they 'll take us out . [ android ] what should i do ? [ six ] just sit tight for now . We 're gonna go join the others . If you don 't hear from us inside the next 4 hours , Get the hell out of here . ¶ [ man ] i am so sorry that i 'm late . It 's just been one of those days . I 'm sure you can empathize . [ one ] where is she ? [ man ] she is resting comfortably . I meant what i said earlier . I will never hurt her . In fact , this is my small way of thanking you For keeping her safe and returning her to me . [ three ] who the hell are you ? [ rook ] my name is alexander rook . I own a company called dwarf star technologies Along with all of its subsidiaries , patents , And prototypes , including rebecca , Although , i believe in your company she is going by portia ? [ six ] i 'm pretty sure you can 't lay legal claim To the results of banned research . Last time i checked , the creation of human facsimiles Is against the law . Oh and what would you have me do ? Put one of those ridiculous tattoos on her neck As if she was some common android ? [ rook laughs ] No . Although rebecca 's biological components are superior , She must be constantly monitored and maintained by her nanites . Slow down the nanites , slow down rebecca . Is that what you did to her ? Yes . I have blanketed this entire facility in a dampening field . At its present lowest setting , it merely renders her harmless . But at higher settings , it will shut her down , And ultimately destroy her . We can 't have her escaping a second time . You know , she was created right here in this facility . She has no memory of it because her consciousness Was inert at that point . She was moved to a more appropriate , Secure facility for her awakening . [ three ] yeah , how 'd that work out ? Not particularly well for the program , Or for the 43 scientists and security personnel Who lost their lives when she made her escape . We believe that there is a flaw in her neural network That leaves her prone to irrational behavior And outbursts of extreme violence . Listen , you are very lucky . It was only a matter of time before she turned on you too . [ one ] so you say . [ rook smirks ] [ rook ] if i actually considered any of you a threat , You would already be dead . Now , come ! Eat ! ¶ ¶ [ five ] you left her ? [ three ] didn 't have a choice , kid . [ six ] prepare to jump . [ five ] you left her ? ! [ scientist ] they 're gone . [ rook ] good . Let 's get to work . ¶ [ android ] i 've dropped us out in close proximity To the system 's a-type main sequence star . As long as we remain within it 's radiation shadow , We 'll be undetectable by long-range scanners . [ one ] but it 's safe , right ? [ android ] absolutely not . If you 're going to come up with a plan of action , I suggest you do it quickly . [ rook ] hello , rebecca . [ two pants ] Who the hell are you and what did you do to me ? And why do you keep calling me rebecca ? Because that 's your name . And you are ? It 's alex . You-you really don 't remember me ? No , i don 't . Where 's my crew ? They 're gone . What do you mean they 're gone ? I mean they left . They got in their shuttle , flew back to their ship , And they jumped . No . They wouldn 't just leave me . They didn 't have a choice . For the moment , at least , neither do you . Open this door . Come , sit down . Let 's talk . Open this door or i 'm going to come over there And break you in half . Your people-breaking days are over , at least for now . I 'm sorry , but you are no longer special . And as long as this dampening field is active , You 're less than normal . I am so sorry , but i can 't have you running off again . What the hell are you talking about ? What is the last thing you remember about your past ? Waking up out of stasis on a ship . That 's it . Those people you came with , they did something to you . No , those people are my friends , And they 'll be coming back for . I don 't think so . But if they are stupid enough t , We 'll be ready for them . [ three ] i say we just do what we do best : We head down there , We kill everyone , and we bring her back . [ one ] as much as i admire your suicidal optimism , There 's no way of knowing how many men or guns they have . [ three ] fine . So we 'll lob a couple of orbital strikes Their way first to soften ' em u . [ four ] a ship to surface bombardment would be inadvisable Unless we knew exactly where she was being held . [ six ] besides , they 'd see us coming And if they have anti-satellite capabilities , They 'd tag us before we even got off our first salvo . [ one ] okay , how about taking the marauder in ? It 's smaller , easier to avoid detection . We can hit them with a couple of precision strikes . And then what ? And then land and storm the place . But at that point we 've lost the element of surprise . [ three sighs ] They 'll cut us to pieces before we get anywhere near tha , If we made it that far . The second we land , our shuttle becomes a stationary target . [ android ] then don 't land . Come again ? [ android ] take the marauder , but don 't land . There 's another way into that facility . ¶ [ door ringing ] [ five ] uh , hang on . Come in . [ door opens ] [ six ] hey . Uh , just wanted you to know , we 're gonna go get her . I knew you weren 't serious about leaving her behind . The android 's coming with us , Which means someone has to stay to monitor the ship . You just don 't want me there Because you don 't think i 'd be any use . I don 't want you there because two wouldn 't want you there . The android is gonna enter a program into the nav system . If we 're not back inside of 4 hours , It 'll set an automatic course for the nearest space station . You 'll be on your own . This is unwise . You 're abandoning your obligations to the ship . I 'm fulfilling my duties to the members of its crew By helping to ensure their safety . My actions will in no way compromise this vessel . They will indirectly , if you don 't return . I have every intention of doing so . After careful consideration , i 've come to the conclusion That the benefits of retrieval outweigh the risks . Two is integral to the security of this ship and its crew . She is system-proficient , a capable leader , And ... She is my friend . Friendship implies a mutual affection . You 're not programmed to form emotional attachments . Furthermore , the assumption that she would reciprocate- - The crew has demonstrated a concern for my well-being , Sometimes at the risk of their own lives . They engage me as an equal . They are ... Nice to me . Humans have an innate tendency to anthropomorphize . The fact that you possess human features No doubt engenders a subconscious confusion . Might i remind you ? You are a machine . A machine with friends . ¶ [ two ] back on the ship , i knew i was different . I just didn 't know how . Even after i found out , It was just too unbelievable to comprehend . But now , seeing all of this i ... [ rook ] you should be proud of what you are . Your body can overcome any abnormal biological pathogen . You can regenerate . You are faster and stronger . You are superior in every way . So my nanites can cure me and protect me , But they don 't prevent me from aging ? No . In the long run , that would raise suspicion , And we just couldn 't risk it . Why not ? You are perfection . You are a living reminder of all of their failings . And they will hate you for it . If the authorities ever found out about you , They would use all their power to hunt you down and kill you . But you 're safe now . You are safe with me . And i promise you , i will never let anything happen to you . Why was i created ? The answer to that question Is part of a much bigger conversation . And one that we will have ... In due time . ¶ ¶ [ six ] okay ! ¶ ¶ ¶ [ alarm ringing ] [ rook ] what 's happening ? [ scientist ] they came back , they buzzed the facility To test our perimeter defenses , but they 're gone now . You think she made it ? Let 's hope so , because she 's our only shot at pulling this o . ¶ [ two ] what are we looking for ? [ scientist ] a defect that might explain a few things . Such as ? Your aberrant behavior . Have you found anything ? No . Your results show your brain functioning normally . I expected your scans would reveal psychopathic tendencies In the cerebral cortex related to empathy , But it doesn 't seem to be the c . Well are you sure you 're getting the right readings ? I 'm sorry , this , it 's moving all over the place . Don 't touch it ! I told alex you needed to be restrained but he was insistent . I can 't hurt you anymore . Of course not . Then why do you have a problem with me ? Were you working at the facility when i escaped ? No , but many of my former colleagues were . I was to be involved in phase three but we never got th . You saw to that . I 'm sorry . Are you ? Do you feel remorse ? According to your scan , it 's physiologically possible , But i can 't help but have my doubts Given the digital evidence recorded at the scene . Your actions were quite calculated And devoid of emotion . I-i can 't remember . How fortunate for you . I wish i could forget the images i 've seen . You may have him fooled , but i don 't believe it for a se . Your time will come , and when it does , I look forward to dissecting your brain for a closer , More intimate analysis . ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ Okay , approaching the facility . Running a scan . And ? Nothing . No unusual radiation signatures . What 's taking her so long ? It 's not like she 's just gonna stroll in there and get it done . She has to quietly enter the facility Without alerting anyone . [ bang ] ¶ [ grunting ] [ grunting ] [ glass shatters ] ¶ [ six ] then , she has to trace the dampening field to its sour . Who knows how it 's laid out down there . Could be a maze . And there 's no telling where they 're holding two . ¶ ¶ I told you she couldn 't be trus . Rebecca , you disappoint me agai . ¶ ¶ Let go of me ! I swear i 'll kill you ! Every last one of you ! [ door opens ] I tested you and you failed . I 'm sorry but we 're going to have to start over . Maybe this is for the best . We 'll be able to do a complete analysis and gain A more full understanding of where we went wrong , So the next brain we give you is free of imperfections . Goodbye , rebecca . Wait . Wait ! Wait ! I could grant you the mercy of shutting you down Before the surgery , but i think this is a wonderfule To test your pain receptors . [ buzz ] [ six ] okay , coming in for another approach . Running a scan . Still nothing . Come on ! How long does it take to blow some shit up ? ! It 's not like it 's rocket science . Maybe the field emitter was harder to find then she thought . [ four ] could it be possible that it 's affecting her as well ? ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ [ saw buzzing ] No . No ! Something 's gone wrong . We 've got to get down there . Can 't . We set this shuttle down and we 're a sitting target . So set the shuttle down out of range . What ? You think you 're going to cover that distance on foot ? Well we 've got to do something . Come around for another pass . [ sighs ] ¶ ¶ Your regenerative abilities have been severely compromised . [ saw buzzing ] ¶ [ machine failing ] [ grunts ] This is a great opportunity to test your pain receptors . [ grunting ] Help me ! [ panicked shrieks ] [ buzzing ] [ shouting ] ¶ ¶ Hey ! [ grunts ] [ gunshots ] [ gunshots ] [ android ] the marauder is awaiting my signal . Would you like to help me blow something up ? [ rtwo would i ! [ six ] alright , coming up on the facility . Running another scan . Okay , i 've got an explosion- - Multiple explosions ! Whoa ! [ five ] i knew you 'd be back ! [ one ] worried we wouldn 't make it in time ? Nah . I deleted the nav command you guys entered , just in case . And what if we hadn 't come back ? Then i would 've programmed a new one . [ six ] i didn 't know you knew how to program . Neither did i . [ water running ] ¶ ¶ ¶ [ three ] come on , seriously ! [ six laughs ] [ three ] you just send me out there man , i am ready . Once around the ship , no problem . [ once ] yeah , more like once around and into the side of the . [ three ] hey , hey , hey , hey [ all laughing ] [ six ] trusting you to fly that shuttle Is like betting on him in a fight . [ six laughs ] no offense ! [ all laughing ] [ four ] he just needs proper training . [ six ] are you offering ? [ four ] absolutely not , i already have a student . [ five ] he 's gonna teach me to kick all of your asses . [ three ] ooohhh . [ two ] hey . Um , i wanted to thank you guys , all of you . You risked your lives to save me and i really appreciate it . Well , we just figured that if we didn 't , And you somehow managed to escape on your own , You 'd come back here , you 'd never let us hear the end . Never , but you 're probably righ . [ all laughing ] [ six ] come , sit . [ six ] pour that woman a drink . [ six ] pour that woman a drink , someone ? [ two ] okay . [ one ] here you go . [ two ] thank you . [ six ] cheers , guys . Cheers . Cheers . ¶ [ two old recording ] so . [ four old recording ] you were right . [ two old recording ] then we 're agreed ? [ four old recording ] yes . [ two old recording ] he has to die . [ four old recording ] when ? [ two old recording ] before we get to the mining colony , After we come out of stasis . ¶ [ breathing machine beeping ] [ breathing machine beeping ] [ mystery man ] where is she ? [ rook ] she 's gone . She escaped . She had help . How old is this body ? It 's 24 . You see what happens . Would you like to be next ? That won 't be necessary . We 've nearly completed work on the new prototype . And what are you going to do about the other one ? We don 't need her anymore . Her continued existence threatens ours . You say she has friends who assisted her ? Yes . Do they know what she is ? Yes . Then they 'll need to die too , a . All of them . Yes . ¶ [ footsteps ] ¶ ¶ [ door opens ] Hello .

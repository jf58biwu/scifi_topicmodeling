 A neolution gives us the opportunity at self-directed evolution . You 're gonna see glaciers and hot springs . There 's reindeer in iceland . Topside is sending an investigator to dyad . You have to play rachel . Who 's a dirty clone ? Rachel , i trust you had a pleasant journey abroad . You 'll wake up with a perfectly matched prosthetic eye . Take care of krystal . Now you come to me , because now you believe Your girlfriend is a mole for castor . I don 't know who castor is . Tell me everything . Oh , my god , it was you ? They told me that i could help save mark . I love him . How long do i have ? We 'll find the original castor . She 's the castor original . Absorbed a male twin in the womb when i was formed . I got two cell lines , me . That 's your mum . Castor and leda are siblings . She 's leda . Do you remember that day ? Sorry , daddy . That 's right . Sorry , love , you 're just meant for us . Leekie killed my susan . " ... Were boiling up out of the enclosure - " and through their stormy darkness " of flickering threads of blood red flame . " and the thatched roof ... " come on , rachel ! You can 't leave me again . No ! Hello ? Doctor ? Hello ? Is anyone here ? This place has been tied up in court for months . Your friend seems to be making himself at home . Ahoy there , scotty . Nice work , men . - Hey . You 'll be safe . No one will find you here . Okay ? Hey , i can 't thank you enough for this . Well , i do what i can for the sisters . You know that . Just call . - I 'll be close by . - See you . Right . Scott , shall we bring her in , then ? Voila , the woman of the hour . Get off me ! I 'm not a bloody criminal . Threatened and arm-twisted onto a plane , Stuffed into a bloody clown-suit in the back of a van . Give ' em here . There you go . What are you gawping at , you toothy little git ! Get your arse in the tent . Get off of me . Jesus . Hey , how come my original looks nothing like me ? Yeah , that 's one of the cool things about a chimera . I 'm right bloody here . Sorry . With two different cell lines in your body , They express differently in combination . But isolate the female genome and you get ... But , her other half is castor . You 're still breathing now , ma , But i will incinerate you , If it looks like one speck of your flesh Will end up in their hands . Er , no one is getting incinerated . All right ? hold fast , scotty . Cosima 's on her way . We 're not safe here . I can feel castor coming after us . You know they are coming . Not only that , Delphine has topside breathing down her neck . Yeah . ' cause we 've got what they want . We 've got the original . They are all coming . Well , we 're not gonna avoid them then , are we ? No , we 're not . Gird your loins , scotty . Is the director on board ? Well , i 'm not sure ... Can you take care of this ? - Of course . - Maybe . I 'll take care of my boys . All right . Ma 'am . Mr benchman . How are you feeling ? I 'm fine . Did you see the director ? Sarah found your original . I want you on the ground there in two hours . The director wants you to know How much he appreciates your service . I can make it . Just tell me what needs to be done . Sarah 's gone to ground with the original . None of her people are visible . Except for one . Who do you think it is ? The soccer mom . I am so thrilled to be here on this sunny election day . And i challenge us all to think of our children today . And vote for hendrix for inclusion . Can i get a little neighbourly love for bailey downs ? Thank you , maggie . Thank you , gavin . So nice to see ... - Marci ? - Alison , we 're not in india . There 's no provisions for loudspeakers on election day . Oh , i think that 's what you call a loophole , marci . You are perilously close To violating the election charter . Kids not cuts . Okay ? Who would like some free soap ? - Hey . Go on . - Anyone ? Vote for hendrix . Deep breath . Okay , wait for it . What is this surprise , donnie hendrix ? no , i 'm not gonna ruin it for you . Are we going on election bus with sestra alison ? Er , i am , but you 're not . Here . All right . Press it . The middle one . Okay . Go , go , go . - You found my boyfriend . Surprise . We thought , you know , it 'd be nice for you . Okay , go . - Howdy , helena . - Howdy , jesse towing . Shay , it 's me . Are you with your psycho girlfriend ? No , i am alone . Sorry , i know you didn 't do anything . So i am not a corporate spy now ? delphine just ... We work on classified science . We have a lot of reasons to be paranoid . Reasons ? Mmm . She 's insane . You know that ? She told me she was gonna Open my veins and let me bleed out in my bath . What ? I don 't even know what to say to that . I 'm sorry . Yeah , i bet you don 't . Why didn 't you tell me you 're in the military , shay ? Did you do a background check on me ? You 're not practising chinese medicine , are you ? No , i quit that , too . I 'm just an rmt . Why would you lie about that ? Because we met on sapphire , a dating app , Where you fluff up your profile , Re-invent yourself . You know , for that i 'm a liar ? Because really , i think from day one , You 've been the liar . I have ... I have , like , no clue who you really are , do i ? I wish i could tell you . So , tell me . Just ... Just tell me . Sorry , i can 't . Just go . Go ! Dr cormier has blocked off the rest of the day for you . How thoughtful of her . - Dr cormier . Hello , ferdinand . Could you leave your man outside , please ? I 'm impressed , delphine . You eliminated rachel . And sarah 's done what no one else could , Found the original . All i found was a council house , burnt to the ground . No casualties , thank goodness . No trace of any organic material at all . Ever wondered if you 're overplaying your hand ? Constantly . Delphine , there is nowhere i like to be more Than under the heel of a woman , But sometimes it makes me seethe . Rachel was special . She was so Beautifully brittle . I want the original . Once i return her to topside , Then i can have my own seat at the table . And then you can toil under my heel . How 's that ? That 's not how it 's going to work , ferdinand . Ferdinand . Miss manning . I 'm gonna give you one chance at a deal . You 've become quite the player , haven 't you ? Last time i saw you , you were shackled in the basement . Was i ? You 've come all this way across the pond , Why not try some local colour ? Who is a dirty clone ? You are . what ? You two ... That was you , all the time , as rachel ? You 're not getting kendall malone . All you need are biological samples . With her genome , topside can finally reproduce Duncan 's cloning trials . But i want castor dead . You 're the lesser of two evils , ferdinand . Virginia coady is trying to weaponise their pathogen . But , without her science , Without the original , castor dies out . I can get coady for you . But if you cause any bullshit , Malone 's incinerated . Every cell . You wouldn 't kill leda 's only chance of a cure . I 'm immune . - You okay ? - I 'm nervous now . I 'm having , like , hot flashes . - Hey . You ready ? Yeah . I 'm not gonna let one of them touch my blood . Blood and tissue , in fact . Look at this one ! Like a pikey with that hair . Another pikey bloody doctor stealing my genes like duncan . oi , you think it 's funny ? You think i 'm a laugh ? No . No , not at all . I think that we should get you out of this suit Because it 's totally unnecessary . Oh , it 's unnecessary for me to look like a bloody fool ? Hey . I 'm cosima . May i ? Hey . Yeah ? Aw , that 's better . You know , erm , your clones , we call each other sister . Call yourselves what you want . You 're just a bad copy of me . Yeah , we 're kind of over the whole " bad copy " thing . It 's way more accurate for us to call you older sister . Touch me and i 'll gut you ! It 's okay . Hey , i got it . I got it . I think i should stay though . - She 's not going to gut me . I wouldn 't be so sure . I don 't owe you nothing ! No , no . In fact , i owe you . You gave me the stuff of life . And you 're ... The closest thing i 'll ever get to a cure . So could you give a sister a little blood ? Awesome . Thank you . - You sure it 's them ? yeah . They 're under assumed names , but , er , it 's them . - Yeah . Room 207 - 207 . What are you gonna do ? I 'm right here , and i have no idea . I do . Thank you , arthur . That will be all , okay ? We 'll talk to you later . You always think that i can 't handle the tough stuff . But you know what , sarah ? This time follow my lead . Okay ? Fine . Holy shit ! It worked . - That was badass , fe . - Thank you . Get up , you bleeding weasels , you 've got company . You gave them the book . The most valuable thing we had . So what ? So you could buy your way out of castor ? What do you think , coady 's just gonna call you from mexico And tell you she 's got a cure ? She 's not interested in a cure . No , she is interested in that weapon inside you . She 's not gonna let you just walk away , mark . All i know is that this feels like freedom . We just want the next few months together before ... before it kills me , too . mark , you can help us . We can stop coady , But we need to know what her next move is . Please . Just tell her . If those two can sequence your genome , Your miserable genetics may actually help . They 're your genes , too . And this is how you treat me ? No bath . No bed to sleep in . bath , is it ? - Here 's your bath now . - What 's that , then ? Sulphuric acid . Two ways to thoroughly destroy genetic material , Incineration or chemical reaction . and there 's me thinking You were gonna kill me with that bath . I was planning garden shears actually , Some satisfaction for my john . John sadler started that fight , I just finished it . He got what he deserved ! But i loved him . I loved him , and you took him away . He took you away from me . But now you 've got my precious blood , You can finally get your revenge . Not quite yet . But i promise you , if anything goes sideways , If it looks like castor has located us , You are going into that acid . Ferdinand thinks rachel is dead . And he 's poking around . Well , i 'll have her moved to a private facility . Right away , please . Rachel ? Oh , my god . Rachel , i need you to calm down . Nurse . Nurse , i need some help . What ? Where am i ? What ? You 're the doctor from the salon . What ? What ? You 're the family doctor . Krystal ? What am i doing here ? Why am i here ? What 's happening ? - What happened to my eyes ? - It 's okay . No , no , no , no . - What happened to my eye ? - You have to lie down ... - Dr cormier . - What ? - Should i get dr nealon ? - No , no . Please , just wait outside . And do not tell nealon . - Am i blind ? Am i blind ? - Relax . You have to relax . - Just lie down . Just breathe . - What happened to my eye ? We 're gonna look at it . Okay ? Just breathe for me . Relax . Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! I can see . - Okay . - You 're fine . No , i 'm not fine . Why do weird things keep happening to me ? What 's in my nose ? What is it in my nose ? Finches . Where am i ? Tell me where i am ! Who 's keeping me here ? Wait . A prison break ? Yes . - Holy moley ! yes , much moley . I break free my sestra , Now mrs s is my new mother . And i live here , and make soap , And teach children karate . - Wow . You do live large . - Mmm . Man alive , it really is good to see you again . okay . ah ! okay . Just , wait ... I have science baby inside me , But you are my first . Gosh , sweetheart , you had me at soap-making . wait , wait . - Where is that thing ? - Here . Where is it ? This is new phone from my brother , sestra . What ? My family needs me . What ? Erm , right now ? Well ... I have waited long time for this . I can wait longer . So can i . Over here . Smile , alison . One more shot , please . One more shot . Great ! Thank you . - Okay , five minutes max to kiss babies , okay ? - Mmm-hmm . Okay . Three more stations to hit before the polls close . Okay . Thank you , sarah . Thank you . Alison , i feel really good about your chances . Oh , thank you , denton . We really appreciate your support . Keep your fingers crossed . Oh , lordy . Okay , everyone , on the bus . Okay . Yeah , let 's go . Go . Go , go . S , we 're back . Just trust us . We know what we 're doing . Okay , everyone , on board . All the way to the back , please . Thank you . here we go , alison ! Here we go ! - Everyone on ? Yes , honey . Come on , let 's go . here we go , alison ! Here we go ! Yeah ! Here we go , alison ! Here we go ! It 's from donnie . Rudy 's tailing alison . It 's like he said . He 's gone after our weak flank . I still do not trust him . All right . Can we get on with it ? There isn 't a lot of time . Shit . Now the eye . He 's still there . - You all right , honey ? - Mmm-hmm . Er , we 'll be making a little pit stop . Just a quick stop . Are you okay with this ? Yes , donnie , i 'll be fine . Okay . All right , everybody , Let 's go on to the next polling station . Come on . Helena , this is a surprise , but i guess it 's fitting . I hoped i would see you again . Prison rules . Only one of us leaves alive . Mmm . It 's happening to you . I don 't tape . You will be sorry when i slice your bicep . Rudy , what happened ? I went after alison . I found helena . But , ma , she led me right to the prize . Get back ! Get that thing out of my face , you little bastard . Rudy , where are you ? I 'm sending you the location right now . She 's on her way . Not long for you . You are almost at the end . Hold it . Go , go . You are winding down like toy . Oh . Shit . Virginia coady ? I 'm ferdinand . You won 't find what you 're looking for here . You did the right thing , mark . Yeah . Do you remember your childhood ? Every minute . I remember sleeping , My brothers breathing in unison . We 'd sleepwalk out of bed , And all pile in the corner like puppies . When i was nine , i was made to shoot puppy . We 're just like you , helena . - You poisoned women . - We had a purpose . - Just like you . - No . You are rapist . Ma ? All right . So castor 's down and out , And ferdinand has coady . Then as soon as we give him the original samples , This should be over . Hey . As soon as we have a few minutes , why don 't we ... We don 't we finally chat ? - We three . About what ? About you , love . Right , ma ? She is your clone sister , That means her daughter is your niece . - My niece ? - Please , ma . Whatever it is you 're holding back , Help my daughter understand who she is . It all goes back to duncan . All right . Five , six years after he harvested me , Duncan returned . Admitted what he 'd done . Cloned me . - Now he was in fear of his life . - From who ? Something called neolution . He was paranoid . He didn 't know who to trust . He said they 'd polluted everything , Poisoned the science , corrupted his wife , susan . But he 'd hidden me , the source , from everyone . Even her . Duncan said there was one child outside it all . Lost in the foster system . I sent him to my daughter , the rebel . You had the connections to hide duncan from them . And in return , he steered the lost clone to you . You put us together . I couldn 't expect forgiveness . But i wanted you to have her . She 's your blood , too . A little piece of me . All i had left of my foul life to give . jesus ! Ma . Shit . They 're here . So , we know rachel flew to austria As krystal goderich . She took a car to innsbruck , Was admitted to a private hospital , And disappeared . You 'll never understand anything , delphine , Unless you adjust your frame . Tell me who you work with . Turn on the screen . You won 't be disappointed . Where am i ? Who 's keeping me here ? - We were there from the very beginning . - Hello ! Topside pursues its profits , The military pursues its weapons , And we steer it all from within . Neolution . It 's down the stairs , gentlemen , and don 't be pricks . Neolution is nothing but pop science . I did my time with aldous . Leekie was a useful face for acceding ideas , But we run far deeper than that . We 've infiltrated and manoeuvred all the players In this experiment since day one . Castor and leda are our adam and eve . Hello . Sarah . Siobhan sadler , i 'm such a fan . Kendall malone . You certainly are a woman in demand . Are you ready ? This will conclude our business . I assure you , my man will be gentle . Soon , delphine , topside will unknowingly Deliver the genome right into our waiting hands . To what end ? Wherever you think the science is at , I guarantee you 're wrong . I don 't believe you . We have a place for you . It 's a one-time offer . You 're finished . guards . Guards ? You won 't live till morning . There now . That wasn 't so bad , was it ? yeah . - Sarah ? Sarah . You cannot give the genetic material to ferdinand . - Why not ? - Because both leda and castor Are run by neolution . Look , we 're all a part of a larger agenda . Ferdinand is just a pawn to get them the original genome . Tell him rachel is alive , and that neolution has her . All right . who was that , love ? It was delphine . Rachel 's still alive . - Rachel ? - She 's taken by neolution . Delphine says you 're just a pawn . What are you looking at ? Continue with the swabbing . They haven 't just infiltrated leda , They run castor too . Both projects . Makes sense , huh ? Those genetically obsessed zealots . I hate neolutionists . I hate them . I hate them ! Hate them ! Hate them ! Hate them ! Jesus , mary and joseph ! Neos in castor , neos in topside . Neos right next to me . We 're everywhere . I knew it ! They 're like ticks . You 'll never know when you 've got one on you . This changes everything , doesn 't it ? Can 't very well hand over your precious genetic material now , can we ? I don 't know what the hell 's going on . Which makes us new bffs . I assume you have a plan to hide your dear mum . - I might . Good . Far away . I don 't need to know where . But i 'll be in touch . You might want to push off now . This is , er , not going to be pleasant . Oh , stop whining ! You okay , chicken ? Excuse me . coming through . Here it is . - Here we go . - Oh , wow . - everybody ! Everybody quiet . This is it . This is the call . Hello . Yes . Yes . This is she . I see . I ... I understand . Thank you . Fifty-six . Fifty-six what ? - I beat marci coates by 56 votes ! Oh , my god ! - Go , before i call the police . - Shay , please . I don 't need to come in . Just hear me out . I know what i did was unforgivable , But i also know that cosima really cares for you . And i think ... I think you two fit . I don 't give a damn what you think . Just know this ... I won 't be in your way any more . But it has to begin with the truth . I want you to give her these . And tell her that i said to tell you everything . If she wants to . It 's her decision . Be good to her . this is so nice . Our original mother , sestra , is not coming ? She had a bit of a day . She 's resting up for the big trip . I 'll be done ... Not to have to think about it . - Sugar , please ? - Sugar ? Oh , no , no . None for her . Oh , yeah . Sorry , monster . Yeah , because in a chimera , Each cell line influences the phenotype of the whole . The epigenetic implications themselves are just mind-blowing . Donnie , you 're a civilian , Would you please say something understandable ? The frickin ' beef is the bomb . Thank you . You 've been quiet . Even i got that . Just a few of us missing is all . To beth . I wish i had known her . To beth , for giving us all her strength . To beth . To my sestra and to kira 's little face . To kira , yes . Who 's speechifying next , huh ? Who 's going ? Honey , why don 't you go ? - You 're the big winner today . Come on , alison . - Let 's go . - Give us a few words . - Go on then . We 're so proud of you . Oh , okay . all right . Erm , i 'm all speeched out , but this is from the heart . I know school trustee isn 't much , But it 's something that we all fought for . A little victory amidst all the bull Cookie . Thank you , sestras , for your bravery , For protecting us , for making us feel normal . I know that whatever comes next , we 'll face it together As a family . And to donnie , My amazing husband , For always doing what 's best And standing by me through it all . Aw . Aw . Okay , everybody eat up . Er , enough of this . Sorry . That 's okay . - You all right ? - Yeah . Well , save room for the ethnic cake . - What 's it called , helena ? - Babka cake . - Babka cake . - Babka cake ? - What 's that ? - Some sort of ukrainian traditional thing . - Meat bread . Is it a meat-stuffed bread ? - Is it meat ? No . Hey , you came . Yeah , unfortunately , i can 't stay . Oh , just for a little bit ? No , i 'm sorry . I need you to keep the sequence genome safe And kendall malone far away . Yeah , i think mrs s is really good at that stuff , so ... - She 's got a plan . - Okay . I know why you did everything you did . To shay and everything . I 'm sorry i made you make those hard choices And then blame you for them . Oh ... Gave your sisters all my love . What will happen to her ? Who 's that ? You 're ... - Charlotte . Yes . - Charlotte . Yes . And you 're rachel . do you know where i am ? She said you 're going to be my new mum . - Who ? - Professor duncan . Hello , dear rachel . Welcome home . Mother ... - Monkey ! - Mommy ! Mommy ! Feet of bloody ice i 've got . Oh , quiet , mum . Oh , i 've missed you . I 've missed you . I 've missed you . There 's someone who wants to meet you . Who is it ? In a bit . I just want to look at you . - Yeah . Okay . - Okay . My monkey .

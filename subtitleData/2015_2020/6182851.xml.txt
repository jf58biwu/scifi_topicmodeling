 I can 't do this . ( voice breaking ) I love you . ( sobbing ) oh , my god . What the hell 's going on ? This is seth . They wrote down all my information in this little notebook . And then yanked out a piece of my hair And put it in a bag . The child is lost ! You will not be welcome back here again . - I love her . - ( gun cocks ) - ( gunshot ) - sarah : We need to get you to a hospital . Mark : No ! If you take me , my people will find me . The reason we can 't find the castor samples Is because johanssen used them , To make a clone . Mark ! I 've got it . Please let me go . Mark : Stand down , soldier . I 'm your superior officer . We don 't leave loose ends . No , we don 't . You must be parsons . ( struggling ) kill me . Guards ! ( helena groaning ) ( scorpion purring ) Pupok ... Scorpion : You killed their lab rat . What did you expect , cheesecake ? He was suffering . And now you are . ( sighs ) ( coughing ) Oh , helena , Guilty pleasures won 't help you escape . ( gasps ) ( theme music playing ) Rudy : Poor little brother . Never even saw the sunlight . No . His dna doesn 't have the synthetic sequences That make you and your brothers viable . Viable but defective . But by comparing his genome to yours , We can isolate the defect . Develop a gene therapy . However , the major is returning . ( scoffs ) He 's not gonna be happy about our new guest . No , he won 't . And I don 't need you stirring the pot , So you 're gonna leave . Ma , no . I should be here for mark to debrief . You and your brother did well . I 'll debrief him when he 's stable . You have 48 hours , enjoy yourself . Yes , ma 'am . Hey . Hey ! - ( pounding on door ) - hey ! Hello ! Hello ! Anybody ? Oh , shit ! Helena : Not so smart after all . Oh , my god ! Helena ! Helena ! Hey ! Hey ! Oh , god , you 're alive ! What have they done to you ? Are you okay ? I 'm most wonderful . Hey , look at me . What have they done to you ? You put me here . What ? No ! Hey , are you hurt ? - Hey ... - You did this to me ! And now you make deal with their mother . Me for you . ( sighs ) shit ! Helena : Yes , much shit . Hey , hey , that 's not what happened . I don 't know anything about their mother . Scorpion : Give her nothing ! Don 't worry , pupok , I will sew my mouth shut . What ? Helena , please , look at me ! Art : Sarah , it 's art . You 're supposed to check in , let me know that you 're okay . ( knock on door ) - Don 't let me worry . - ( mobile beeps ) Are you arthur bell ? What can I do for you ? Sarah said to come here if I was ever in any trouble . You met sarah ? - When ? - Two days ago . In halton . Well , you better come inside . Mrs s : Thanks , love . Felix : Of course . You know , tracking down long-lost clone children takes time . She said she 'd call if she has any news . Just a wee bit concerned . Me too . ( mobile vibrating ) Then again , we should probably be concerned about this . Cosima , she got an internet date . - Oh ! - ( chuckles ) Hello , sapphire . I can already tell this is going to be a waste of time . Cos , you 're scouting , nothing more . You 're just there for 20 minutes to determine some physical chemistry . ( chuckles ) oh , god , felix ! Just be yourself . - And don 't bail , okay ? - Okay . - Ciao , darling . - Bye . ( exhales ) Don 't worry , you 'll be fine . I 'm just super-nervous . I don 't wanna , like , fart Or spill my tea on her or something . Just don 't spill your purse . No one wants to hear about an ex . Do I like reek of it or something ? - Yeah . - ( door closes ) I just ... - Dang , girl ! - ( chuckles ) Okay , bye . - Hey ! - Hi ! Sorry . - Cosima . - Shay . Hi . ( clears throat ) wow . I mean , I saw your pictures , but ... - Are you sure you 're in the hard sciences ? - ( chuckles ) Yeah , yeah , I am . Um ... Thank you , I think . ( chuckles ) We went back to the hotel , but my mother found me . We had a big fight . What about mark ? I don 't want to talk about mark . Look , gracie , If you 're pregnant , the best place for you to be Is with family . Is there anybody else who 's not involved , An aunt , a cousin , maybe ? Nobody . Well , I got to get to work . Okay , so I 'm gonna take you to a shelter . You 're an expectant mother , you 'll be first priority . I lost the baby . That 's why they cast me out . I think I know someone who can help . Shay : You 're nervous ? Is this your first sapphire date ? Yeah , yeah , it is . Uh , I just got out of a relationship , so I 'm Not supposed to say that . ( clicks tongue ) I 'm nervous and so I 'm babbling And it 's not good . It 's okay . Here , I 'll babble , okay ? Um , my first internet date , bridge-and-tunnel goth . Black choker , spider web eye make-up . I mean , the whole shebang , And none of it in her pictures . And the best part , every time she thought we had a connection She insisted on high-fiving me . - Ooh , wow ! - Yeah . I 'm way worse than that . - You totally are . - I 'm warning you now . - Thank you . - ( laughs ) So , you from , uh , you from around here ? This is how we do this , okay ? Prairie girl , hated the winters , Two siblings , parents split when I was six , Pescatarian , blue , barcelona . Barcelona 's your favourite city ? Yeah , it is . - Up high , buddy ! - Ooh ! - No . No . You 're hilarious . - Ooh ! Not doing it . - It 's kinda my thing . - No . No , no way . - No ? - No , no high fives . Sarah : Helena , I ... Yes , yes . There was a deal made for you , But I didn 't make it . Mrs s did . She traded you to castor To get me and kira out of dyad . She made a bad choice . Scorpion : Sarah 's lying . She 's poison . She 's gonna melt you like butter . Shut up about the butter ! What ? Look ... ( clears throat ) Mrs s , she made that decision to protect her granddaughter . Think of what you 'd do to protect that baby in your belly . Keep it far away from you . You know , I had to send kira away again , Because these castor assholes came after us . But I knew I had to come find you Because we can 't fight them alone . You know , I should 've just left you here to bloody rot ! In convent , I lived for four months in a broom closet . I do not rot . ( sighs ) ( distant door opens ) Five , four , three , two , one ... ( door unlocks ) Another one of you bastards . Soldier : Back away from the door . Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty . Against the wall . I don 't think so . Come on , let 's go . Sarah : Helena ! Soldier : Let 's go . - Hey , helena ! - Come on . Helena , you know they 're our brothers , right ? They tell you that ? Head down . ( creaking ) Oh , well , you 're the bad mother , eh ? Dr virginia coady . You must be very proud of your boys . Fine , let 's chat . What have you done to my sister ? Helena 's fine . She 's been confined and controlled much of her life . My opinion is , a secure environment gives her comfort . This is dr silva . What are you ... What are you doing ? What are you doing ? You got your bloody genome , what do you need ? A contribution . We have high hopes for the original dna , But your biology can 't be ignored . So , we 're going to take some stem cells By filtering your blood . It 's a process called apheresis . We 'll start with some samples . You can go to hell , you know that ? Psycho bitch ! I 'm not someone you can fight , sarah . It 's probably the last place you expected to be . These are good people . Okay ? Felix : This is insane ! They 're creepy , crypto-religious fanatics . Look , she says she split from them and I believe her . Then fine , why don 't you keep her ? After everything she 's been through , She needs a friend , felix , not a cop . And she knows her husband 's a clone ? Art : Yeah , she seems to . And she 's obviously struggling with it . Yeah , well , she doesn 't look ready for cult-deprogramming to me . She looks a damn sight better than you did when I took you in . I was not yet formed . You were a budding delinquent at six . Now go on . - Help her get settled and I 'll see arthur out . - ( groans ) Go on ! You , baby jesus , come up the stairs with me . Listen , I 'm not quite ready to raise alarms , but ... - Sarah . I know . - Yeah . I 've got some friends at halton pd and they 're looking . She was tracking castor , it just ... I don 't like it . I 'm gonna go through everything again . Criminal databases , military records , Known points of contact . Look , if there 's a trail , I 'm gonna find it . ( sighs ) - Okay ? Yeah . - Good man . ( door slams shut ) The mother wants to make medicine For the mark first boys . Yeah , thank you for the warning . They took , like , a gallon of blood . You say they are our brothers ? - I do not believe . - No ? - Mmm-mmm . - I don 't care what you believe . You 're institutionalised . What does this word mean ? It means that you love it here . Don 't worry , I 'm sure they 'll make A nice little cage for your baby too . To a rat , a small hole is like a door . Have you figured a way out of here ? Eat your food , sestra . Shay : Oh , right , you 're the , uh ... You 're the hard scientist . Yes , I am annoying like that . Holistic healing , though . Like , tell me what that 's about , from your practise . I focus on nutrition , Body work , spiritual counselling . You 're either in balance or not , And if not , I try to help you get there . ( shutter clicking ) Plus , I can , uh ... ( whispering ) I can see inside your soul . My friend would totally , um , Be shocked that I 'm doing this , but ... ( inhales deeply ) You wanna go somewhere ? Hell , yes . ( breathes sharply ) Easy , son , easy . We cleaned and resutured the bullet wounds . We also redressed your arm . What happened ? I , uh , I burned it off , To prove my loyalty to the pastor . And that , also part of your cover ? I did what I had to to complete my mission . And you did . What 's her name ? Gracie . Pastor 's daughter . And you consummated this marriage ? Yeah . Just remember , it wasn 't real . She 's not one of us . Your first logbook . Any intimate contacts , their names go in . Felix : I think there 's an old box With some of sarah 's clothes in here . Yup . I doubt anything fits , though . I don 't blame you for not wanting me here . I wouldn 't trust me either . You know I sleep with men , right ? I 'm not stupid ! But as a prolethean you disapprove . I 'm not a prolethean any more . Really ? And we 're just supposed to take your word for it ? Look ... All my life I 've had doubts , But I just let my parents tell me what to think and what to do . I 'm 18 years old and I 've never smoked anything Or been to a rock concert or gone skinny-dipping . Brilliant . Let 's start with skinny-dipping . The shower 's down the hall . Okay . Helena , How many men live on this base ? Approximately , 11 million . ( sighs ) I know you . I know you 've counted them . ( distant door opens ) Five , four , three , Two , one ... ( door unlocks ) All you had to do was stay away . What 's this then , eh ? No uniform , no rank . I 'm a major , sarah . Yeah , I wouldn 't wear a uniform either If I was doing illegal shit . Come on , now . You are short on friends . Are you all right ? - Fat lot you care . - I do care . I was trying to keep you out of all this . ( helena smooching ) Hello , dirty paul . Hey ! You know what ? This is the guy who sold you out to s . You don 't believe me , you can piss off too . Helena : Is this true , paul ? It was either her or you . Sarah : So you 're a snake either way you cut it . Now if you thought about it for one second , You 'd realise all I 'm doing for these men Is what you do for your sisters . Protecting them . So they can assault women and abduct people ? That 's a hell of a cause . And helena 's innocent ? How many people has she killed ? Just do the right thing . Let us go . That is out of my hands now . ( door slams shut ) The military is just another family , sarah . Your genetic siblings are dying . Everything we do is for them . You tell yourself whatever you need to . Opening up their heads , I think parsons would disagree . Second lieutenant parsons sacrificed What little life he had left for his brothers . He begged me to end it . How you murdered him . And you destroyed months of data That could 've helped them . Maybe you 're next , paul . ( vocalises ) Sarah : Yeah , paul ! Maybe you 're next ! There 's some food downstairs if you like . Thank you . ( chuckles ) Look at those crazy kids of mine . Gracie : Sarah looks so happy . Mrs s : Why wouldn 't she be ? I was always taught they were less than human . - Abominations . - ( sighs ) But your father took helena in . Because she was fertile . He thought she 'd been blessed by god . Fertile , infertile ... They 're all just people , love . Even your mark . Though those castor boys are no friends of ours . I don 't presume to know How you feel about losing the child ... Then don 't . My father put that baby inside me And my mother let him . What an awful thing . Why are you being so nice to me ? I was married young too . Eloped , much to the utter disappointment of my mother . My husband , john , was killed . Gracie : Oh , my goodness . We were going to have a family . When my husband passed , I was adrift . Angry , but I couldn 't go back home . My aunt joan took me in , And she stopped me from self-destructing . So , I 'm your penance ? No . You 're my guest . I brought you helena to keep sarah off the table . She fell into our hands , paul . - Sit . - We had the original castor dna , That is all you need to develop a cure . In theory . We still have to extract a viable sample from the bones . Will you sit , please ? These two sisters are unique . They offer alternatives . The time you bought us will save lives . And no harm will come to sarah manning , I promise . What are we doing , virginia ? What we have to . Parsons knew that . ( cosima moaning ) Oh , that 's it . Right there . - That 's your medius . - Mmm . That is some serious tightness . ( slow music playing ) You wanna talk about the break-up ? " loving is short , forgetting is long . " - That 's beautiful . - Mmm . It 's pablo neruda . My mum made me read everything . ( chuckles softly ) - You okay ? - Mmm-hmm . Do you want me to go ? No . You want me to , um ... ( whispers ) ... Stay ? I don 't know . I 'll go , okay ? Her name is delphine . She and I worked together . And she 's french . Mostly just really great hair . Which is now in ... I find it in all my clothes and shit . I don 't know what I 'm doing , But you 're way more than I expected . ( whirring ) Come on , helena . I know you 're planning some kind of escape . I have no plan , I 'm institutionalised . ( sighs ) Come on . We 're surrounded by desert , Yeah , so we 're in mexico or something . Come on , talk to me . I can help . ( grunting ) You want to be my sandwich ? What ? In siberia , when planning escape , You take weak person with you . They 're called " sandwich " because you eat them . ( laughing ) You wanna know why I left kira with mrs s ? 'cause I was too young and I felt tied down and trapped . So , I would leave kira with s for days on end . And one day , mrs s wouldn 't let me see her . Why she does this ? Uh , ' cause I was high or hungover or some shit . But she was right to do that . But ... ( clears throat ) I left town with vic , Just to show s what a mistake she 'd made . I missed nearly a year with my kid . Just being selfish . ( voice breaking ) I didn 't get to watch her grow up . Or share her secrets . Or be her mum . So you wanna hold this stupid grudge , you go ahead . Fine with me . Okay , sarah . Okay . But you have to help me . ( sighs ) Felix : Hey . You never told us john sadler was killed . - You were eavesdropping ? - Yeah . I wasn 't about to leave you alone with rosemary 's baby , was I ? Come on , s . ( sighs deeply ) He was a beautiful rebel . Also a fairly beautiful drunk . Had a habit of rubbing people the wrong way . There was a drunken fight , and he ended up With a pair of garden shears stuck in his throat . ( exhales ) Why didn 't you tell us ? Took me a long time to let go . I 'm in no rush to relive that pain . ( footsteps approaching ) Everything all right , chicken ? I 'm tired of being cooped up like one . I 'm going out . Oh , to a victoria 's secret fashion show ? To a club or something . I was gonna ask you to come . ( laughing ) Hang on just a minute , miss . You don 't even know where you 're going . Felix ! Wherever they drink mai-tais . Uh , whoa ! Hang on here , just one second . Um , do you know what ? I think that we could do with a plan . Yeah , a plan . I also think we could do with a cocktail . - That 's a great idea . - Felix : Yes . Sarah : Helena , what 's happening ? Any moment now . ( distant door unlocks ) Both : Five , four , Three , two , one ... ( door unlocks ) - Meal tray . - Sarah : I 'm not done with it . Man : Yes , you are . Put it through the slot . Why don 't you come in and get it ? ( chuckles ) Open it . Great , everybody come in . Go ahead . ( grunting ) Uh . Ah-ah-ah . I don 't think so . Okay ! ( groans ) I would suggest you show the brothers some respect . Make life easier on yourself . Okay ? Cooperation is your friend . You can take her back now . What do you call this ? Gin and juice . Dressed to party , much like you . ( groans ) ( rock music playing ) Come on , madam . You 've got to start somewhere . Do you hear this ? It 's in here , gracie . Come on . And in here . Okay . Feel it . Enjoy this . Come on . Felix , come and help us . Come on . Okay . Let me show you how it 's done . Okay . You wanna twist . All right ? Mrs s : Go , gracie ! Felix : Okay , now bring them forward . Mrs s : Felix ! ( laughs ) It 's how it 's done . It 's a good look for you . ( whispering ) hey ! Helena , it worked . Sarah , I think you were institutionalised too . Sorry I ever said that . Okay , ready ? Sarah : Hide , hide ! Hide . All right . Good , good , good . Good girl , good girl . ( rock music playing ) She 's got good moves . ( gracie giggling ) All that handling , felix , and she 's just a normal girl . Careful with your gloating or you 're going to get more wrinkles . Cheeky pup . I love alcohol ! Yes , we all do . You do , don 't you ? Come on , felix . All right . That 's it . ( felix laughing ) shake it . See , darling , that 's why I don 't dance in heels . - Gracie ? - Come on , gracie , don 't quit on me now . - Gracie ? Felix , turn it off ! - ( gracie groaning ) - What ? - Gracie , honey . Gracie : Something hurts . - Mrs s : 911 , now ! - Yeah . Mrs s : All right , honey , I 'm here . Helena : Okay , I 'm ready . You ready ? You ready ? Okay . Um , um , um ... Okay . Go !

Let 's make this quick . I have to put my daughter to bed . ( panting ) What 's with the sunglasses ? I 've been sick . The doctors don 't know what 's wrong . For all I know , those assholes gave it to me . I need to check your eyes . Can you open them for me ? ( breathing heavily ) Scorpion : What are you doing ? Go , stupid . Moya sestra ... She tears my heart . Scorpion : Your sister 's dead . Think of the baby inside you . Miller : Everyone , get out here now ! Now ! Out ! ( alarm blaring ) Anders is down ! Helena has escaped !

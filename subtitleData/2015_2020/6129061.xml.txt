I just don 't want to move there . I don 't understand you . I just don 't get you . I 'm afraid we 'd turn out like my parents . How could I ever turn out to be a pig and you a cow ? Here you go . One sausage and one coffee . Hi . What 's up ? Err ... I was thinking of making a fish casserole . When were you thinking of coming home ? I don 't know . I 'm a mascot , not a clairvoyant . Whoah ! There are new norovirus cases again . Where ? - In The Sweatshop . As we suspected . The cases follow a pattern . Someone must be spreading it . - That 's impossible . The norovirus is an infectuous disease - that causes diarrhea and vomiting . It moves from feces to hands and then into the mouth . The incubation period is from 12 to 48 hours . It doesn 't spread this fast without someone spreading it . You two spend way too much time together . Anyone can be the spreader . I 'll go home and cook . Come home when you 're done playing Noro Avenger . Noro Avenger . Sorry , I thought there was no one here . I can clean this later . Can you give me toilet paper ? Thanks , Milla . - Do we know each other ? Not yet . How do you know my name ? - I figured it out . How ? From my voice ? Your name and photo was on the wall with Aimo 's and Pirjo 's photos . Your voice doesn 't match Pirjo 's photo . Are you some kind of wise man ? Milla , you have to move . - You mean move out ? I won 't take a stance on that . You have to move forward , change your diet . Add fiber to your diet . We all should do that . I know it personally . - Got it . Have a nice evening . Malla and I were thinking of taking it easy today . You want home brew or wine ? - Neither . No thanks . - So wine for you . We agreed we wouldn 't drink today . I 'm not drinking . But you already had a sip of sherry . - I most certainly did not . I drew a line here before I went to the supermarket . It 's strange how much sherry evaporated while I was gone . You 're staking me . It looks delicious . You bought an old chicken . I had to roast it well . Everything is my fault again ? - Yes , everything is your fault . You damn cow ! - You fucking pig ! What ? - I gotta pee . Sure . What are you doing ? Stop ! Stop ! Fuck ... Let go of him ! Stop ! Stop , for freaks sake ! We 'll move out as soon as possible . Wait . Welcome to the palace of love . What do you have in this box ? - My kettlebells . Your kettlebells ? - Yes . What a horrible dump . - Thanks , Siiri . Do I smell mold ? Yeah , it is mold . You can 't move in here . My supernose only smells dust . I can also smell that someone has a yeast infection . No need to get personal . Look at this place . This really is a pretty horrible dump . This place is our home A palace of our very own This is what we can imagine We can paint the walls But even comfy shawls Won 't make this a cozy place In a fairy ﬂew To help you redo Your house with his magic powers A queer fairy 's magic starts He waves his wand and alas His magic words he imparts A queer fairy will turn your house into a palace Oh what a stink I 'm going to faint , I think I feel like throwing up A spell works on the smell better than superpowers Soon the smell will be gone A queer fairy 's magic starts He waves his wand and alas His magic words he imparts A queer fairy will turn your house into a palace Are you asleep ? No . What are you thinking about ? Tomorrows leg workout . I 'm wondering whether or not we 're gonna make it financially . Of course we 're gonna make it . Where are you going ? You wanted a late-night snack ? - No . We 'll start saving money in this jar - so that we can make this a perfect home for us . - Yeah . But first we have to empty it . Give me one . - Come get it . Him ? - No , he doesn 't fit the profile . You have to wear a shirt that says " A gay is cumming . Are you ready ? " I 'm also embarrassed by your sense of style , thanks for asking . People can tell you 're gay without the shirt . I want people to know I 'm not in the closet . You don 't have to worry about that . Nice shirt . What happened ? - A girl just said she likes your ugly shirt . I have a crush . Damn , I have a crush on a woman . Dude , you 're a closeted straight guy . - I 'm not . I know what I want . You 're bi . - I 'm not . I think we should call it a day . He 's not coming . - Yeah . My muscles are getting sore . I want a sausage . - I want coffee . And some Kimble . That 's gluten-free , right ? - No . Honey . Our little monster is hungry . Breastfeed him . Vesa , cover your tit ! I don 't like you breastfeeding in public . Where did you get a tit for Vesa ? - From Jukka Kasvi . Let me get to the point . Esa is coming here . - No ! You only have to meet him . You 'll see right away that he 's a better man than Aimo . Siiri , I can still hear everything . - Good . You can have kids with Esa . You and I can hangout in cafés . Stop setting me up with people ! Not until you find a good man . The vomiting and diarrhea bug is still spreading . - Unbelievable . Noro Avenger attacked the gym . - How is it possible ? The next occurrence will be in Nacht Park - or this place . I 'll be going home . - Yeah . I 'll come later . It could be really late . Women . Maikki doesn 't understand that when we catch Noro Avenger , - everything will be different . I 'll get my job back . The woman I love will notice me . Pirjo , I still love you . I love you . Who 's he ? - He doesn 't fit the profile . Hi . What would you like ? Hi . You 're Milla ? - Yeah . Siiri said you 're good-looking , - but she didn 't say you 're that beautiful . Esa Sivunen . - Esa ? Siiri , you promised . - Just look at him . Sorry , Esa , but I have a man . - Oh . Okay . Siiri didn 't tell me . Milla will be single soon . - Siiri , what the hell ? I 'm single . Milla is way too young for you anyway . I agree . Pirjo is a much better choice . She 's always positive . She 's got curves and smells lovely . And she 's really good in bed . - What ? According to a lot of men . That 's nice to hear . Thank you . I think I 'll just have coffee . I 'll make you a machomato . Can I also have a machomato ? - No . What have you told Siiri ? - Nothing . You know her . I don 't want you to see her . - Of course I 'll see her . No , you won 't if I tell you not to . You can 't tell me not to see my best friend . I 'm telling you not to see Esa . - Now , seriously . I haven 't done anything wrong . Your self-esteem is just so low . You 're always looking at other men . - This is what I mean . MY BATTERY IS DEAD Women make you lose your mind . On hi . - I-n . Sorry about what happened . - That 's okay . It was a bit embarrassing . I 'll continue my workout . Bye . - Bye . You need help ? - No . You sure ? - Yeah . This is my basic workout . Okay . Dad ! Dad ! I 'm serious . What ? - Come with me . This way . Watch out . Shit . Where were you after work ? - Oh , stop . I just dragged my zombie dad home and I 'm dead tired . I don 't want to argue . Can we talk tomorrow ? - I guess I don 't have a choice . Oh , hi . I 've been waiting for you . This is enough for the down payment . Well , what do you want ? Morning . Morning . Have you seen Aimo ? How did I get here ? I brought you here . You were drinking in the park . Again . You have a beer for me ? What do you think ? Why do you always have to drink ? When you get older , - you 'll understand that sometimes you have no choice . Right . You have no choice . What the heh ? Did you take money from the jar ? - What ? I 'm in such bad shape I haven 't been able to get up all morning . Shit . Got any beer ? - No ! Aimo . What have you done ? - Got extra strength tor my guns . I can do everything faster and better . You shouldn 't have taken money from me . Look . Great . Integrated bottle openers . We were saving to redo our place . You should be happy that your man is so strong . That was sarcasm . Hi . What would you like ? We 'll have two meat pies with wieners . And coffee . Milla ! Greetings from the Andes . Pirjo ! Three coffees , please . - Yeah , yeah . Let 's see . Who 's Andy ? The one who sent greetings . The Andes is a mountain range in South America . Right . A mountain range . The ventilator cord has come off . Is this Mark-106 ? - Yeah . Furious power . 1,000 kg of lifting strength . - Young men and their muscles ... Pirjo . Lovely to see you . Roope . Roope . Did you come to take me away from here ? - This is just a stopover . These people violate the rights of the worker . Get behind the counter . We 've got customers . See what I mean ? - Pirjo , get behind the counter . The trade union . - " The trade union . " The trade union . Did you buy your arms from Jukka Kasvi ? Yes , I did . - Be careful with him . They 're more than just metal . You 'll get hooked on the power . What do you mean ? - It 'll turn your soul cold . Bullshit . These give me strength . Believe me . I did the same thing a long time ago . For years I was heartless and cold . Are you done telling your little bedtime story ? It was nice seeing you , old man . I gotta get back to work . I gotta head to Tibet and look for the Book of the Dead . I got an exorcism gig . That 's cool . - I can lift a car . I can do 3,000 push-ups . - What did Milla say ? She nagged me . The " she asked " cope m nag ma . They nagged me together . Just check these out . I don 't understand why he would steal money from me . Milla , get behind me ! Take me to Pirjo ! Maybe you should give him another chance . I mean , he 's not mean or anything . It 's like we 're from different planets . That 's from another planet . Aimo is not . Serves him right . - What did that alien want ? I 'm sure he wanted to discuss your relationship . - I 'm sorry . Gifia , come save us ! What a hard day . I gotta go . Super-He ! Ready to take all the credit again . The only down side is that my legs get tired . Never skip a leg day . What ? - Did she see me ? No , she didn 't . - Hi . Did I see you at the gym the other day ? Yeah , we go to the gym . You had that funny shirt on . - Yeah . The message on the shirt is true . I don 't like to put people into boxes . You mean into closets ? - That 's another way to put it . I totally agree . Err ... You 're a woman ... - Yeah ? If a woman gets mad for some reason , - how can a guy get her to cool off ? Well , we women like attention . You could cook a nice meal , - light a couple of candles , maybe a neck massage . Romantic things like that . Personally I like it when a guy confesses his love to me . You took the words right out of my mouth . We girls like attention . Can I buy you a drink ? - Sure , I 'M have a home brew . Undercover . - Oh , that 's right . You 're late . - I had to calm Maikki down . We were supposed to have a romantic night in . That 's what it 's like in a long-term relationship . There 's no more mystery . I 'll go take a piss . Keep watch . - Got it . Did anything happen ? - Nothing at all . Here you go . Bon appétit . I 've got a surprise for you after dinner . Why did you buy those ? I thought no one would steal you from me if I had these . Stem me from you ? I 'm not your property . I 'm with you of my own free will . This food is awful . You can 't even cook macaroni . Why didn 't you buy chef 's arms ? You 're never happy . This food is good . Exactly . I 'm sorry , Milla . I shouldn 't have taken the money . You don 't owe any money for them , do you ? - No . Of course not . Can you forgive me ? Not before the jar is full of money and Punky has a cage mate . Deal . I still have the surprise . I love you so much that I named the diner after you . You 're crazy . - I 'm your crazy guy . You know what I 've been thinking ? - Yeah ? How do your arms work in bed ? I can sleep with these just fine . That 's not what I meant . - Oh . You mean sarcastically . Oh shit ... Are you ready ? - You 're hurting me . Let me get on top . Sorry . Get on top . Are you ready ? Kaboom . Did you fake it ? - Oh no . It was lovely . Best sex in a long time . - Oh , okay . I 'll go ﬂush the condom . Aimo . Come to bed . - It might take a while . I think I got the norovirus . COULDN 'T SLEEP . GOING TO WORK . KISSES . Hi , Aimo . Is there still love in the palace ? - Of course . Soon there won 't be any . This is my microwave . Jukka ! - Yeah ? What 's on your mind ? I can 't cum and my arms are limp . You can 't cum and your arms are limp ? Let 's see . It 's no wonder . Your battery is dead . Dead ? - Yeah . Nothing in the world works without power . You never mentioned a battery . How do I recharge these ? - You need to buy a recharger . Or I can install a small power plant on your back . You 'd never need to recharge the battery . - How much is it ? It doesn 't cost that much , but there 's one hitch . What ? - It 's heavy . Damn heavy . We need to make your legs stronger . Can I pay in installments ? This is hard-core . Aimo . You promised you wouldn 't get more parts . - Check this out . It 's got a sound system and everything . The whole world is trying to keep me down But I won 't let it beat me It seems to spin the wrong way ' round You can 't open my letters . - It says you owe money for those . Why did you He to me ? I had no choice . Frigging déja vu . You 're just like my dad . I 'm not your dad . - I 'm kicking you out anyway . What do you mean ? - I 'm kicking you out . Fine . No , I 'm leaving and dumping you . And that 's a metaphor . You can 't . I did it first . You damn cow . You fucking pig . Can ' ? we stop this moment in time now that I 'm so happy He fits the profile . Noro Avenger ! Norovirus alert ! Everybody stop eating immediately ! Don 't move ! This is a citizen 's arrest . - You better obey the security guard ! Put the finger down ! What do we do now ? There 's two of us . He 's got only one weapon . Shit . Put the fingers down ! There 's no escape . The game is over . I 've already avenged you two . We have the virus . - Then we 've got nothing to lose . Get him ! Hola . Oh my God , you have mew legs . - Aren 't these cool ? I can 't understand why Milla doesn 't like them . Mi casa es su casa . Yup . Hi there . You got nice ... machines . I was just leaving . I 'm so confused . I 'm in love with the wrong person . It was so much trouble to come out of the closet - and call all my relatives and tell them I 'm gay . Now I have to call them again and tell them I 'm straight . You 're bi . - No . I 'm definitely not bi . I 'm as gay as can be . Bisexuals are perverts . Bisexuality is unnatural . You 're biphobic . - This has nothing to do with phobias . It 's common sense . Bisexuals are insecure people who don 't know what they want . Milla . I can 't understand why you can 't understand me . You think therapy would help you understand me ? Would you go into therapy ? Was that sarcasm or a metaphor ? - Neither . I mean , yes . Or ... Both . Or we should both go into therapy . Couples therapy . Couples therapy ? - Yes . I think you could go into metal recycling . Hi . Oh , you 're playing Shithead . How 's your investigation going ? We 're still looking for Noro Avenger 's motive . I wonder what it could be . Noro Avenger is crazy . Maybe it 's just boredom and a desire to have an adventure . Or loneliness . Loneliness ? - Yeah . You women don 't understand these things . Only a crazy narcissist would do something like that . It 's really nice they let you keep your uniform , - since you 're so righteous . This is my official work uniform . And it 's mine . Are you coming home tonight ? Noro Avenger is on the loose . The next attack can happen anywhere . Hey . Hey . Let 's focus on this . - Coffee ? If you want Aimo back , which I don 't understand , - you have to show him he can 't take you for granted . You have to be sure you want him back . You have to remember that you 're two individuals . You can 't force him to do anything . On the contrary . You have to force him . Make him Jealous . He 'll understand he has to respect you . A relationship is all about playing games . Milla , you 're a strong woman . You don 't have to play games . Wrong . Strong women are players . Vesa is just so weak that he plays fair and won 't cheat on me . I 'll take Vesa for a test ride if it 'll improve your relationship . He wouldn 't touch a superhero who ﬂies like an epileptic . Your tits are leaking . I can have dinner with you after all . - Sorry ? I said I could have dinner with you . How about tomorrow ? - Sure . Milla . - What is it , Aimo ? What are you doing ? - Nothing . Five years ago we invented an artificial Wormhole . It 's like a black hole we can control . Our company was the first to commercialize the invention . We sell trips to the future . How does it work ? Look at this napkin . If this napkin is spacetime , - the corners are quite far from each other . If we fold it like this ... Voila ! Could you end up in the wrong time ? Well , it 's safer than traditional flying . And classier than the way Super-Gitta ﬂies . You seem a little absent . What 's on your mind ? - Aimo . Aimo ? What am I doing here then ? I 'll go to the ladies ' room . Ampari Sorry , but this is the ladies ' room . - That 's okay . Can you give me paper ? Thank you . Have you ever thought that maybe you should finish what you started ? What are we taking about ? " How classy is it to go on a date with another man - when you 're going through a crisis in your relationship ? " What ? - Just reading the horoscope in a women 's magazine aloud . " It 's not always smooth sailing for an Aries . " Well ? There 's something wrong with this machine . My heart hurts . I might have a solution for that , but I can 't give you another loan . You gotta help me . - What can you give me ? I 'll give you my diner . Ready ? I 'm sorry I went out with Esa . I just wanted to hurt you . It doesn 't matter anymore . - What do you mean ? Shouldn 't we talk ? - You can talk about whatever you want . You can 't hurt me anymore . I have a metal heart now . It 'll never ache again . I 'm sorry to say that I sold the diner . We can 't afford this apartment anymore . Start packing . I 'll move to Ampari 's place . Where will I go ? - I don 't care . Are you gonna take that little rat with you - or should I throw it in the trash ? How can you be that heartless ? Oh , that 's right . What 's going on here ? The new owner is revamping the place . You 've just been replaced by new staff . I 've got a microwave . - What ? You 're fired . The time has come . I 'm calling the trade union . Good . Do it . Is this the trade union ? Hello . This is Pirjo Perékorva . I was just wrongfully dismissed . What invoice ? I 'm not a trade union member ? Oh yeah ? I couldn 't care less because I 'm fed up with all trade unions ! You can keep your diner . Goodbye . This is my microwave . - Goodbye . This is my microwave . I 'm kinda busy . - I 'm moving in . I 'm busy . What the heh is going on ? I 'm busy . Hi . You should 've said you 're busy . I 've got news for you . Your little romance won 't last . - Aimo ! You should be aware that a crush only lasts three weeks . What the heh has happened to you ? Maybe I should leave . - Yeah , you should . No , you shouldn 't . Aimo should . - Yeah . Like love , friendships also end . What 's wrong with him ? - A heterosexual relationship . Could we continue where we left off ? Sanna , listen . I don 't think this is going to work out . Are you lactose intolerant ? This is lactose-free . I love that you have a crush on me . I need love and I get it from you . But I don 't love you . Fucking homo . - You can say that again . You could 've warned me beforehand . You think you went a little overboard last night ? Nah , I don 't think so . You want me to get coffee ? I can get it myself . Milla ! - You can 't drink ! Why not ? Everybody else in this house drinks . The apple doesn 't fall too far from the tree . Okay . You got our attention . Good . What are you going to do about it ? This might shock you , but we talked . We decided to get a divorce . That 's great . Finally you got it . But please leave me alone now . I 'm hungover and want to sleep . Hi . - Hi . What happened with you and Aimo ? He 's become unbearable . We broke up . That 's all . - You broke up ' ? There 's something bigger going on . Something bigger than our breakup ? I didn 't mean it like that . Aimo has changed . Please try to fix your relationship . He needs help . - It 's not my responsibility anymore . I never want to see him again . Thanks for dropping by and letting me know whose side you 're on . Bye . What the fuck ? I can 't even kill myself right . We 're selling the house . - Good idea . It 'll be a new beginning for everyone . I 've seen him before , but this time he really rocked . An impressive guy . We thought we 'd give you part of the money . He 'll probably do it again . We 're witnessing the making of a new world record . One more failed attempt and we have a new world record . Oh my Lord . One hundred consecutive failed suicide attempts . How do you feel ? I 'm pissed off . - Now that you broke the record , what 's next ? I 'll keep jumping until I die . What a great Finnish man . You have to admire his perseverance . Good Fuck ! - Thanks . Aimo ! Aimo ! I can hear you . Can you help me up ? My arms aren 't working . Can you fix my arm ? I gotta get back to the roof . You have to stop jumping off roofs ! Yeah , drowning might work better . - Okay , you got my attention . We 'll go get your heart back and make you Aimo again . Dammit ! - Don 't yell . Move it . - Don 't push me . Shut up . - Don 't yell . Go ! - Don 't yell . Move it ! Move it ! I 'm in the middle of a treatment . Wait on the other side ! He 's in the middle of a treatment . You feel better ? - No . But firing people will be easier . I 'm sure . Nice doing business with you . Hey , panda . Catch this . What is it ? - We want Aimo 's heart back . Oh no . You can 't have it back . But I 've got tons of tits and asses for you . We just want the heart back . I 'll consider it when Aimo has paid his debt . I told you it wouldn 't work out . What do you want for it ? - Hmm , what do I want ? Ten thousand . Twenty thousand . No , fifty thousand . No , ten million . You 're horrible . - I 'm nice . I haven 't even tried to recoup the debt on his heart . I can tell you it would be a messy job . Let 's get out of here . - Yeah . I can give you a good deal on ice fishing overalls ! What an a-hole . - Yeah , he 's a little mean . On the other hand , he has cheap ice fishing overalls . I got an idea . Let 's rob him . - No . I give up . I 'll stay here and starve to death . Recycle the metal - and throw the rest in the biodegradable trash . If you can . You don 't have to . - Seriously . Don 't yell . - You did this to yourself . I 'm fed up with you . I do this to avoid disappointment . Life has nothing more to offer to me . It only takes . Milla , Milla . You should 've told me you were coming . I would 've made coffee . No ! Panda , let me go ! Panda ! Panda ! Let go ! I don 't have time for hugs ! Aimo . I got your heart . - You 've always had it . Which one is it ? - Probably the one that is broken . Frigging ice fishing overalls ! It 's this one . I told you this isn 't going to work . Here 's a little couples therapy for you . You asshole , Jukka Kasvi ! Jukka Kasvi , let go of my man ! Oh dear . I haven 't caused you any trouble , have I ? - A little . What can I do ? - Remove Aimo 's machines . Of course . Let 's go to the shop . We want Aimo 's diner back . - Absolutely . I 'm hungry - I 'm hungry - I want to apologize one more time . - Everything 's good . You sure ? - Yeah . Panda ! Let 's go outside and play tag ! No explosion ? This might sound weird , but this doesn 't feel right anymore . I understand . I feel the same way . Much ado about nothing . Without it we might not have realized that this is not our time . Did we make the right decision ? - Give me paper and I 'll tell you . What goes around , comes around , like the contents of my stomach . You have to make the same decisions over and over . That 's cryptic . - Have a nice trip to the future . You 're paying for the coffee , right ? - Are you serious ? AH my money goes to trade union dues . There 's no such thing as free coffee . Satan , come out of this baby ! This baby is dean . The exorcism worked . And to top it all off , Vesa cheated on me . The things we do for our friends . You don 't have to thank us . Vesa is a serial cheater . Everybody wants my man . This is my lucky day . That 's my ex . Pirjo ! Please forgive me . Get out of my way ! I 'm so fed up with aliens ! I 'll take you to the airport . - Yeah , we 've seen this all before . Oh , hi . You got a job . - Tickets and passports , please . You know us . - Can you ever truly know another person ? We would 've caught Noro Avenger if you hadn 't given up . You can 't have everything . You don 't understand anything . Have a nice trip ! Take care ! Milla . You think this could 've ended differently ? - Not this time . Maybe we 'll see each other in the future . I hope that wasn 't sarcasm . - No , it wasn 't . It wasn 't a metaphor , either . Maikki ! Milla . Where is Milla now ? Milla ! One . Two . Three . Four . Five . Six . Seven . Eight . Nine . Déja vu . Déja vu . Translated by Aretta Véihéilé Proofread by Rich Lyons

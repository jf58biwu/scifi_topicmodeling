 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... HYDRA grows stronger every day , while S.H.I.E.L.D. clings desperately to a world it no longer understands . Why not lead ? My time will come . Tell me what happened to my mom . Your mother was special because she had a gift . Whitehall cut her to pieces . I 'm gonna kill the man who destroyed my life . You killed him . He was mine . We 're human , Skye . We just have the potential to be more . There 's someone new . Tell the others I 'm on it . Trip ! We finally get to find out what we become . After you change , no one else will understand . They 'll be afraid . Change is terrifying . Poor thing . How long since he passed through the mist ? Fourteen hours since Terrigenesis . He 's very emotional , Jiaying . I can see . Leave us . Gordon ? Gordon , it 's me . Jiaying , help me ! I can 't ... - I can 't see . What 's happened to me ? - Shh . It 's all right . Take a breath , Gordon . Help me , please ! That 's why I 'm here . Can you follow my voice ? Take my hand . It 's okay . Come on . Come on . It 's okay . I 'm right here . Come on . Almost . It 's gonna be okay , beautiful . I 'll show you the way . Go ahead , let it out . It 's okay to cry , Gordon . I 'm trying . But ... But I can 't . We prepared for this his whole life . Readying him for whatever may come . Every cell within him has changed , in his body and his mind . It 's terrifying . But he 's the ideal age , old enough to understand , young enough to adapt . He 'll be fine . It 's a blessing you age so slowly , Jiaying . Able to counsel so many generations through the change . I won 't live forever , Yat-Sen . Well , even with the years of preparation , without your warmth to guide them through their transformation , these poor souls ... They would be lost . I haven 't been able to sleep either . I keep thinking Trip is gonna come see me . Make fun of me for being stuck in quarantine . Call me a goldfish or a hamster or something . And every time I wake up I remember all over again . I just can 't believe he 's not coming back . He should not have been down there . You both went in for a good reason . To prevent HYDRA from starting a cataclysm . He was trying to save me . He may have saved all of us . The Obelisk triggered a massive earthquake . Imagine how much worse it could 've been if he hadn 't destroyed it . He died a hero . Once medical clears you , we 'll get you out of there . You 'll just be stuck underground like the rest of us . How 's everyone doing ? Just trying to keep busy . Everyone deals with it in their own way . When you sign up for this kind of life , you accept that loss will be part of it . But you never get used to losing one of your own . Especially , when it 's a good man like Trip . It happens too much . Over time , it makes it harder to let people in . Sometimes itjust makes you want to pack up and run . Is that what you wanna do ? Run ? Sometimes . You ? Couldn 't even if I tried . How long did it take for Mack to get out of quarantine ? He cleared pretty quickly . Whatever took over his system is gone . But he 's pretty shaken up . And Simmons ? Is she back ? Not yet . She has a team documenting whatever they can in the tunnels , cleaning up . But it 's slow going with no electricity . Be careful with that . This area is finished . She 'll assess the structural integrity of the place , and if possible , blow one of the vertical shafts under the ocean floor . Flood the city with water . And drown it for good . Hopefully the bedrock wasn 't too badly damaged by the quake . The temple collapsed on itself . It 's a miracle you 're still alive . Did you find Raina 's body , yet ? There 's a lot of rubble to dig through . But not yet . Whatever gas came out of that Obelisk hit you , too . That 's why we 're being extra cautious . It 's hard to make sense of all this . What ? No . No , it isn 't . We lost . We failed . Skye , don 't say that . It wasn 't because of HYDRA , it was because of me . Don 't blame yourself . If I didn 't go down there , you could have blown the place . That was one battle . This is a war . And Ward , and my father ... Skye ... The rotten core at the center of everything . We did not fail . Trip prevented a disaster and Whitehall 's dead . We cut off the head , and while HYDRA scrambles for a new one , I will crush them . I 'm gonna make somebody pay . Whoever the hell it is . Thank you , Mr. Bloom , for hosting . I regret that our bi-annual gathering has turned into a vigil . Daniel Whitehall has joined our founder in the afterlife . How unfortunate . I admired the man 's commitment . I was never fond of him . We must not speak ill of the dead . Why , what 's he going to do about it ? What this means , is that there is a vacancy at a management position in this region of the world . And who would you like to see fill it , Dr. List ? Baron Von Strucker thought that Sunil Bakshi was well-groomed to serve in that capacity . So why is he not present ? He 's disappeared . We think he may have been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. Then in all likelihood , he 's dead too . If he did his duty . You underestimate S.H.I.E.L.D. constantly , it would seem . Von Strucker would like this mistake to stop happening . So I 'm gonna make it simple . S.H.I.E.L.D. will take this victory as a chance to move against us . Come above ground . Whomever can remove S.H.I.E.L.D. from the landscape permanently will win Whitehall 's position . Does that sound fair ? Meanwhile , I intend to find out if Whitehall 's obsession with arcane artifacts was fruitless . Or if indeed it did produce something that we at HYDRA can use for our future . These are the last sections , ma 'am . Same conclusion . Cavities are carved from lava rock , therefore these walls are not load-bearing . Alien stone line need to create electro-magnetic flux field . At least I imagine . Can 't measure the bloody thing without electronic equipment . I could spend a year down here answering these questions . Photograph it , mark it off . Let 's flood this cursed place . Yes , ma 'am . No ! Hey . Quarantine survival kit . A deck of cards for Solitaire , bag of homemade trail mix if you want to eat healthy , couple of candy bars if not . Headphones , a few trashy magazines . Cactus Cooler . I keep a stash . I mean , you can only get it in California . It 's the best . Anyway , I 've been in quarantine before , and I know it can drive you absolutely nuts . Thanks . I was beginning to feel like a leper . Are you kidding ? You managed to be taken hostage by three known murderers , you gunned Ward down , then were blasted by an alien chemical weapon and walked out unscathed . Leper ? I think you 're a rock star . You 're staring off into space there , Turbo . No , that 's Skye 's biometer watch . It was damaged in the cave-in . Records her heart rate ? And skin temp . Lots of data . If I can fix it , I might be able to get a better ... Uh ... Like a snapshot of what happened down there . I can 't make sense of it just now anyway . The data in my brain is jumbled today . I 'll get my small electronics kit , and you can start tinkering . You know , working with my hands always cleared my head . How is it ? Your head since ... I told you . It 's not gonna help to give you a play-by-play . Never known you to be afraid to talk about anything . Yeah , well , you didn 't feel it . And I can 't describe it , so ... Well , it 's not good to keep things to yourself , Mack . I know what you 're going through . Really ? You know what it 's like to lose control , to be trapped inside your own body , unable to tell it what to do ? To watch yourself hurt the people that you care about ? Yeah . I 'm sorry , buddy . It 's okay . I 'm a little on the edge . I guess I need to keep myself busy . Can you request access to the schematics for the base ? I wanna double check the ventilation systems and make sure the quarantine is fully isolated , and I don 't want anyone else falling prey to this alien crap . How many victims were there ? Two dead . Three in critical condition . How did Raina do this ? She had no weapon . She was covered in thorns . It 's hard to comprehend . I shot her a few times . - Good . - But none a fatal hit , it seems . I did manage to gather some tissue from the ground , blood and such . How long till you can blow the shaft on the ocean floor ? We 're preparing the charges now . That place will be underwater and sealed up for good . Sir , as much as I 'd like to join the manhunt for Raina , I 'd much rather come back to HQ . See everyone . To study Raina 's tissue and check on Skye . Whatever transformed Raina ... She was exposed as well . We have enough boots on the ground in Puerto Rico to hunt down Raina . Come home , Jemma . Gather everyone . We 're going after HYDRA now . With a prisoner exchange ? Using Bakshi out in the open like that , it 's a dangerous strategy , sir . I know it 's high-risk , but we have a small window to take advantage of HYDRA 's lack of leadership . It puts us out on a limb . With a chance to deliver a crushing blow to those responsible for Trip 's death . I 'll take it . Responsible , huh ? You have something to say , Mack ? Plenty . But I 'll keep it to myself . Oh , don 't mind him . He 's just coming down from the worst alien acid-trip of all time . That 's not funny . Just trying to lighten the mood , mate . Yeah , well , Mack didn 't ask for what happened to him . - Of course not . - No one asked for any of this to happen . HYDRA forced our hand . And now Coulson plans to force theirs . Did they ? Did HYDRA force our hand ? - Calm down , Mack . - Repeatedly , but we have a chance ... Or did we hand them detailed plans and the location of that city ? HYDRA took them . When they took Skye . Are you saying we shouldn 't have gone in to save her ? I 'm saying there wouldn 't have been anything to take if you and Skye hadn 't been obsessed with the alien messages in your damn head ! All right , let 's just ... - This isn 't about blame . - Watch yourself , Mack . No one would have left Skye there , that 's not what he 's saying . I shouldn 't have to ask any of you to save one of our own . You never ask . You just give your orders . No matter how cracked out they are . Mack , you 'd do well to remember your rank , right now . Really ? " Rank " at a time like this ? Why don 't you ... Not helping , Hunter . - Guys , stop . - No , it 's cathartic . Do you have any thoughts of your own , or do you just parrot his ? Coulson 's only trying to stop HYDRA . We didn 't stop anything ! We unleashed something on the planet . Please . No one knows what happened . Trip averted disaster . It could have been a lot worse . And Skye barely made it out alive . Thanks to Trip . He sacrificed his life , Mack . No , he traded his life for hers ! And then he was shattered into 1,000 pieces ! That 's enough ! If Trip was here , he wouldn 't be arguing , he wouldn 't be bitching , he would be gearing up to do what needs to be done . Yes , we 're dealing with forces we don 't understand . But HYDRA , I do understand . I want everyone ready when the sun comes up . End of discussion . Hope you 're feeling better this morning , Mr. Bakshi . Because you have a date with the US government . Smile ! There he is , General . Sunil Bakshi . The man tied to the Navy wedding massacre , UN attack , and who tried to kill you , Coulson . While dressed up as you , sir . Safe to say , I 'm not a fan . Perfect . I 'll trade him to you , to add to your collection . All I ask is your assistance in handling ... Remaining HYDRA forces . I understand the idea , Coulson . And in this case , I 'm not against it . Thank you , sir . Go ahead . You agree with the rest of the team . You 're concerned we 're out in the open . More that we contacted the US government . I think Talbot 's on the level . I 'm not worried about Talbot . But around him ? There are security leaks everywhere . And with Whitehall dead , Bakshi may be even more valuable . I 'm well aware , but without Talbot in our corner ... I know . Without him , we 'll never have a chance to get the upper ... Go ! Go , go ! I count four left . You know what that means . Not really . That 's what it means . Means I 'm gonna do that . Good to know . More will be coming . They must have intercepted our transmissions . Talbot . Come on . Get out of there . It seems you underestimated us again . I underestimated how desperate they must be if you 're this important to them now . No ! You 'll never take us alive ! The SUV 's still running . So get in . Whitehall is truly dead ? Yeah . - Then did Mr. Bloom set up the rescue ? - I 'm just the driver . Who do you take orders from ? I guess , I take orders from you now , sir . Clear ! I was gonna kill her . " They 'll never take us alive " ? Really ? A little over the top , don 't you think ? I only had a day to come up with this whole thing . Besides , if I let you write the script , no one would say anything . You know , Bakshi has a flair for the dramatic . Let 's just hope he bought ours . Word is Coulson 's mad plan worked . Bakshi took the bait . How 's the watchmaker project coming along ? Looks like it took precise work . Your hands are getting better . Well , my head 's getting worse . I 'm totally confused by what I 'm seeing . Turns out the electronics weren 't crushed like I thought . Well , they were , but from the inside out or something . Can you fix it ? Get a look at Skye 's biological data ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . No , yeah , I can . I think so . I won 't know what half of it means until Simmons gets back anyway . They 're landing now . Is every RadioShack a HYDRA outpost ? I always suspected . This is Lighthouse . This is Warship . I 'm free . Oh , Mr. Bakshi . Very good news . But we have a situation . Well , perhaps you better come in . I 'm a few hours out . See you then . Don 't take that gun from your belt . This will be painless . Whoa ! What ... What the hell ? Sorry , I like you , but once you made contact , - my orders were to take you out . - Why ? My employers don 't want you , Whitehall , or your phone-a-friend to get in their way . Sorry about this . Wait . Please ! I 'll triple whatever you 're being paid ! Mmm . I 'm getting paid by a bunch of people . That 'll start to add up . They 're moving against us . They want you out of the picture , if it 's not me , it 'll be someone else . Please . Money is not a question . If you can protect me and see me safely to Bloom , not only will you be financially set for life , but you will also solidify your standing with the true heads of HYDRA . The money will be there , I swear it . If not , I 'll pull the trigger myself . Okay . Get in . Thank goodness nothing bad happened to you . Wouldn 't want you to have to stay in there forever . Raina , she was unrecognizable . It was insane . And not just from the outside , look . We separated her DNA and mapped it using Gel Electrophoresis . Her DNA didn 't just rearrange , it contains extra macromolecules . I wouldn 't think that even possible . - That 's amazing . - It 's horrific . We need to make sure that you 're not contaminated or infected in any way . What 's the worst that could happen ? An epidemic . That 's a pretty harsh conclusion . Well , and I feel responsible . We all do . There 's nothing you could have done . Yes , there was ! I was so curious about powers . About unearthly biology . Wondering where it might lead . Hoping to better understand it . Control it . I should have been trying to terminate it . Erase it from existence . What ? You 've helped plenty of people with powers . It 's part of the world that we live in . It 's a plague , Skye . All of it . It only ever brings us death . Donnie Gill , Chan Ho Yin , Creel , the list keeps growing . - Not the Avengers . They haven 't been ... - The Avengers wouldn 't have been necessary if we hadn 't unleashed alien horrors ! There must be another ... Trip was in fragments ! I know . Well , it ends with him . Flooding that alien city may be the first responsible thing I 've done to protect the people I care about . I 'll check these samples , and compare them to samples of your blood we have from before . Just to be safe . Okay . Just to be safe . Don 't worry , I 'll stay out of sight . Cool as a cucumber , quiet as a mouse . I don 't want any trouble . It 's exactly the way we traveled the world all those years , searching for answers . I knew I 'd find you here . Raina . After all that time , I didn 't quite get the answers I was searching for . I 'm sorry , you didn 't find your way to the temple . Didn 't get to evolve . Oh , I evolved . What the hell have I become ? Raina . Let 's not lose our heads . What happened to me ? Metamorphosis , by the look of it . I was supposed to become something divine , something transcendent . My grandmother said I 'd be an angel . Not some gnarled freak of nature covered in thorns . You always did like flowers . They hurt . And it 's your fault . You wanted this . More than anything . But your thankless daughter was there . She received the gift meant for me . Came through the mist as beautiful as ever . What , what , what ? You mean , Daisy was there , too ? Oh . She emerged from the chrysalis ? Yes . And that bitch took what was mine ! We all have our disappointments . I dreamt of the perfect reunion with my baby girl . Revenge for my wife . Coulson rained all over my parades . But you say she 's done it , she 's changed . Oh . Fantastic news . Oh , she 's gonna be so mixed up , now . Oh . Terribly afraid . She didn 't have your mental preparation . She probably ran right back to Coulson 's arms . It 's the worst possible place for her to be . He 'll put her on the Index . Tag her like a shark . She 'll come to me when she sees how they treat those particular individuals . It 'll never happen . She 'll never love you , you stupid man . The Index . I should reconnect with some of them . Wreak a little havoc . Ruin that man and his dumb suit . Remind Daisy where she really belongs . She may not love me now , but she needs me . What about me ? You ... You have to help me . I did , we helped each other . Achieved our goals . You 're on your own now . You have to find a way to fix this . There 's no fix . There 's no reverse . It 's your lifelong dream . It 's lifelong . I can 't live like this . My insides feel like gravel . I cut myself when I move . I can 't live as this repulsive creature . Then don 't . Pull up over there . That 's a pretty big fence for protecting some grapes . Mr. Bloom doesn 't appreciate unannounced guests . Once inside , I 'll send for you . I canvassed the area , stashed the bike . We 're good here . Your presence is most welcome . Drop the accent , it makes you sound like a douchebag . Now you know what it feels like for me to live in this country . And we wait . You didn 't really take much of a stand during that awkward family argument back at HQ . Nobody meant half of what they said . Everyone 's just raw . Broken up over Trip . Plus you and Mack have that secret to keep under wraps . This again ? Oh , and now Mack 's in on it ? You 're relentless . Now , I definitely think he is . You and Mack have something up and running , and you avoided backing him in that argument for fear you 'd reveal it . If I 'm wrong , say so . 'Cause you haven 't yet . Yeah . We have a secret . I know . We 're in a support group , okay . See , this is the reason I didn 't tell you . Jackass . I 'm laughing because it 's great . That 's the best thing you could have said . We dedicated our lives to an organization that went to hell . Our friends turned their guns on us . We needed help coping , Hunter . And I support it . Really . I was afraid you 'd closed off even more , but this is actually healthy , like , emotionally healthy . And that 's not a phrase I ever thought I 'd use to describe you . I 'm happy to hear it , Bob . Good . So , do you guys pass around a talking stick or ... Thanks for the schematics , sir . Ventilation system 's all good . And , sir , I wanna apologize for my outburst in there . It was uncalled for . I have a little trouble dealing with my anger sometimes . Join the club . Yeah , something I 'm working on , but this alien stuff messed with my head . And losing Trip brought back a lot of hard memories . For all of us . Well , I hope I didn 't blow my chance to work on Lola one day . After that little RC version you built for me , I 'm genuinely considering it . Although , I couldn 't figure out how to make it fly . It doesn 't . Sir , I do think Mack brought up a matter we should consider . I 'm all ears . I 'm aware the team hunting Raina has orders to capture , not kill . As always . But this might be some sort of contagion or even a plague inadvertently set loose . Plagues must be understood , yes , but eventually eradicated . Are you saying that you wanna put Raina down , Agent Simmons ? No , of course not . Uh ... I 'm just saying that if they have to , it may not be the worst thing . Thank you . They want to kill us . A power play . The rest are moving against us , Dr. List . Gave the order to wipe us out . Well , Von Strucker and I are not involved , I can assure you . We 're calling because you may be a target . You think it 's The Baroness ? And The Banker and The Sheikh . We can 't have infighting at a time of transition . We agree . And we promise to smooth this over as best we can . We count on it . I 'll send word . Uh , there is one other thing . There 's a man outside who 's begging to die . Hey , Fitz . What 's wrong ? Can you tell me ? I fixed your biometer watch . Checked your vitals at the time of the temple collapse . You heart rate was recorded at almost 300 bpm . That 's very fast . No . That 's inhuman . I thought the readings were a mistake , that I put the thing together wrong . I 've been struggling to , uh ... Um ... Something 's wrong with the data in my head . What are you saying ? So I was thinking how the heart monitor seemed to shatter from the inside out . But it was still on your wrist when we found you . That doesn 't make sense . And how we found you , basically unharmed in the collapse , with destruction all around you . I thought I was losing my mind all over again . That there was something wrong . So it took a while to dawn on me . Or maybe I was afraid to think it . That you survived the destruction , because you caused it . No . No , no , Fitz ... Raina wasn 't the only one changed in there . And I 'm pretty sure the DNA results we 're running right now are gonna confirm it . There 's nothing wrong with the data in my head , Skye . No ! There 's something wrong with you . No ! Hey . Feeling like you 've been in that glass box your whole life ? You doing okay ? Yeah , yeah , I just ... I feel isolated , and exposed at the same time . Being a caged animal is no fun . It 's for your own good . Temporary . I know . I know . Maybe I just need a hug . I hate seeing everyone fighting . They 're just having a hard time . Yeah , but I 've never seen Coulson like that before . He seemed so cutthroat . I 've rarely seen him like this myself . For Coulson , Trip was the embodiment of the principles he wants S.H.I.EL.D. to be built upon . Compassion , loyalty , heart . And that is S.H.I.EL.D. ' s strength . And Trip 's death reminded Coulson that HYDRA doesn 't have that . And that is their weakness . I 'll get the next one . No more waiting . Why have we stopped ? Coulson . He knows you too well . He couldn 't get to us . So he had us slaughter each other . Fortunately for you , we already promised you to Talbot . So you 're perfectly safe . Come on . Are you bleeding ? We should have your DNA results back any minute now . Once we know there 's nothing wrong , we 'll have you out of there . Something 's wrong ? Uh ... What the hell happened ? Skye ? Fitz ... Fitz was a klutz again . Oh , she 's cleaning up the mess . Sorry , it was my fault . I knocked over the lamp when taking a sample of Skye 's blood with one of those ridiculous hazmat suits on , and I guess my coordination still needs work . But I was anxious to double-check the results , her DNA is an exact match to what it was before . She 's clear . Thank God . I 'm gonna call Coulson . He can use the good news . You all right ? Yeah . Um , Skye , is your bunk made ? Um ... No , it 's a mess . Uh , well , maybe you can get her some clean sheets . She should probably sleep . Yes , you deserve a good night 's rest . Yeah , I mean ... And I would do it , but last time I was in there , there was lots of ladies things , and she 's a slob . I 'll help bandage her hands , it was my fault anyway . Okay . Yeah . What did you just do ? I switched your blood results with your old samples . Give me your hand . The new samples are different ? Drastically . But until everyone around here calms down , I don 't think we should tell anybody . What with the way Simmons is acting . For now we should just keep it between us . Keep you safe . Until we figure it out . Okay ? It 's okay . - This is all my fault . - No . I could have stopped her . I let this happen , and I 'm so sorry . No . It 's okay . Everything is my fault . You 're right . There is something very wrong with me . No . You 're just different now . You 're just different now , and there 's nothing wrong with that . Don 't move . We 're not here to hurt you . We just wanna take you in . No . Either you kill me , or I make you do it . It 's okay , beautiful . I 'll show you the way . ... or that time when Trip tossed me the mag on the Burnside raid and it fell down the sewer grate . Yeah , what did he say , again ? " Good catch , soccer hands . " Did he ever tell you about the time his grandpa took him to Grandfather Mountain when he was a child in North Carolina ? Mmm-mmm . Well , he gets there , and they pull up to the gate , and his grandfather ... I have visual confirmation . Fury 's toolbox is locked in Coulson 's office . Did you manage to wrangle the blueprints from the base ? Yeah . We 're almost good to go . Okay , I 'll make contact soon . And he says , " I 'm sorry , Grandpa . " I thought you owned the whole mountain . " He 'd be mad I told you that story . No , he 'd say ... " Come on , girl . " We 're gonna laugh a lot less . That 's for sure .

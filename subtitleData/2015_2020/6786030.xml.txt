 What will happen to her ? Shut up ! Shut up . Shut up , shut up , shut up . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Uh ... - I 'm gonna call 911 , okay ? - Krystal ? Oh , my God ! Step away . Move away , please ! Why are you here , Krystal ? How did you know my name ? Oh , my God . Who the hell are you guys ? Through and through , pulse is weakening . We stabilise and get her away . The helicopter is on standby . Inform the pilot , this is now a medevac situation . I repeat , it 's a critical situation . Send a medevac ... And you double-checked everything ? Every chromosome ? Yeah , I even resequenced the genome ... with three of the new stem cell lines . Well , my God ... See ? The vector was totally effective . And the sequences remained stable in each lineage ? Yeah ! Yeah , it worked . It really worked . Well done , Cosima . Why don 't you resequence the other subcultures ? I will be back . Wait , so , uh , what does that mean then ? That we 've got a cure ? - And ... and you 're gonna get well , Cosima ? - Yup . Yeah . Fingers crossed . Oh , my God . - That is amazing news . - Holy shit ! I know . - Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - I know . We have , you know , a functioning therapy for all of us , for all the sestras . I 'm so relieved ! I 'm so happy , Cosima . - I can 't wait to tell Alison and Helena . - Yeah ! Hey . - I miss you guys . - Oh , God . We miss you too ! - Oh . - What , love ? Oh , nothing . I 'm just being denied access to the database . - What 's that ? - Hello ? Wait , what 's going on ? They 're offline . - And she 's locked out of the data . - No , no , no , no . They can 't do this to us again . ... euthanizing severely deformed newborns - was the most humane way forward . - That is the CEO of Brightborn . Serves her right for , like , running a stem cell baby factory . Wow . I mean , who would have thought the beauty industry was so corrupt ? I know , right ? - Oh , my God ! - What ? - That 's him . - Who ? Hello , my name is Dr Ian Van Lier . - That 's the guy . - I am pleased to announce that I will be serving as interim CEO for Brightborn Technologies . Oh , come on . - Krystal ? - Yes ! And I have Intel about that French doctor . - You mean Delphine ? - Yeah , it 's about Brightborn and , like ... a Dr Van Lier . Okay ? But I 'm sick of being , like , yanked around by my brain at this point . Chain . Chain at this point . So ... I am not giving you anything ... unless you tell me what 's really going on . Okay . Okay . I know a place we can meet . That 's right , Jim . I 'm here outside the headquarters of Brightborn Technologies ... I can 't get in touch with Susan . Um ... I 'm going to arrange a helicopter to take us back this afternoon . Hello , Sarah . Rachel , what 's going on ? The second we hear about this cure , Cosima goes dark . Yes , well , we 've been having the same problems . Communication is spotty on the island . No , she said she was kicked out of the database . Well , I 'm sure there 's a perfectly good explanation . Hey , hang up the phone . How are we supposed to trust that ? - Hang up the phone . - We brought down Evie Cho with cooperation , did we not ? You don 't know the meaning of that word . Look , who 's this Van Lier character who 's at Brightborn ? Him . I have something . Van Lier is on damage control . Brightborn 's genomic technologies are in no way tainted ... He 's Evie Cho 's personal physician . He 's been guiding her science for years . So he 's another bloody Neo . He will steward Evie 's side during the transition . Wait , what transition ? I thought we put Susan on top . - I thought that was the bloody point . - Yeah ! Well ... politics . Oh , God , will someone listen to me ? - Please ! - What ? - Felix ? - It 's Krystal . She called me . Right ? Now , she 's got dirt on Van Lier . Says that he 's connected to Delphine somehow . How does Krystal figure this shit out ? I have no idea . She 's doggedly wrong , but she gets results . What do you think , S ? I think we have two factions of Neos with competing technologies . Bots versus clones . And if we are not careful , we are gonna get screwed again . We 're not gonna let that happen . We need to find out what Krystal knows about Van Lier . You 're with me , yeah ? Keep trying Cosima , S. Let 's get to the bottom of this . - Be careful . - We will . Shit . - Swears . - Sorry . The Wi-Fi is still down . And these cell replication rates are , like , off the charts . We 'll still get better , won 't we ? We are gonna get so much better . Cosima ? Are you okay ? Yeah . I just , um ... I just need a glass of water . Could you get me that ? Room service . Frittata ? I 've already eaten , Ferdinand . But have you been serviced ? Of course , my company will defend itself resolutely . Brightborn will recover . We were assured the euthanizations would minimise risk , not threaten us with exposure . You 've set the agenda back years . Well , hardly . We can repackage the technology . Yes , but ... we can 't repackage you , I 'm afraid . - What is this ? - I 'm sorry , Evie . It absolves the Brightborn entity of wrongdoing , and protects the patents from further legal actions . No , I built this . It 's my technology , I 'm not about to sign it away . We just got started . Look at the big picture . We 're planning for the future here . This is a minor setback . We 've done great work , Evie . I promise it won 't be for nothing . No ! None of this is my fault ! It 's Susan Duncan and her clones ! Technology is subject to natural selection too , Evie . It changes . It adapts . You 're an engineer . You know that . You built it ... let it take you . You want for me to kill this Evie Cho ? I don 't think she 's the problem any more . You better just stay put for a while . Alison thinks we 've been hiding out long enough . I don 't think the frontier life agrees with her . No , she has the shits . Oh , thank you . Uh , I think it 's Helena 's venison stew . I 'm lovin ' it , though . It 's ... it 's great . - It 's good . Intestines . - Mmm-mmm . Uh , I want to help my sestras . I know , Helena . Just , uh ... stand down for now . Sarah 's on it . We need to figure out who we 're really up against first . Something 's afoot . Susan 's gone dark . Her timing is suspicious . Come now . Clone cures , implanted tech . All that Neo intrigue can wait ... - can it not ? - Don 't . Pleasure first , business second , remember ? I like the cane . Elegant . Multipurpose . I 'm not the same . My ... infirmities . I don 't feel much of anything any more . I spent a great deal of time and ... I lost a great deal of money searching for you . We had plans , you and I. Your eye is magnificent . But your self-pity is repugnant . There she is . - Get on your knees . - Oh ! Oh , God , I 've missed you . I 've missed you too , Ferdinand . - Hey . - Hi . Cosima 's cut off in the Neolution power vacuum , and he calls in a beautician ? Sweet move , right ? Hello , Krystal . Hello , yourself . So what 's this Intel you 've got on Delphine and Van Lier ? It 's life or death . Is it ? ' Cause I basically don 't believe anything you 're saying right now . Are you guys even for real ? Yeah ! If you have any questions , we 're happy to help . Krystal , we talked about this . And we told you that the less you know , the better . Remember ? Well , that 's not good enough for me any more . Okay ? If you want the scoop on Van Lier , you 're gonna have to tell me everything . All right . Buzz us down . I warn you , Krystal , this is gonna come as a bit of a shock . Okay , like , nothing shocks me nowadays , so ... Oh , this is way more realistic . Yes . Hello , you . You look nice . Well , thank you , Krystal . You 're welcome . There 's someone we think you should meet . Oi , I 'm over here . - I tried . I did . - Right . - Hi , who are you ? - I 'm Sarah . I 'm , uh , your clone . Okay , clones like- - Like genetic identicals , made in a lab . Right . Oh , this is what you think I look like ? - Pretty much . - Yeah . Okay , are you , like , blind ? 'Cause this girl looks nothing like me . Like , first of all , my tits are way bigger . And secondly , even if you could drag a comb through that hair , she 's like a seven on a good day and I 've been told I 'm a ten . - A seven ? - She has a point about your hair . Okay , so ... you guys , at this point , have literally no idea what 's going on . It 's so cute . So let me lay it out for you straight , okay ? This is about human experiments , and two factions fighting to control them . Shit , that 's right . - Oh . - Right ? So we have Est√©e Lauder , okay ? And then we have this Swedish company called Neolution . - It 's crazy how right you are . - Thank you . Krystal , do you think you can elaborate just a little bit more ? Give us a few more details ? Absolutely . But , like , hold on tight , 'cause this is very confusing . So ... Dr Van Lier is absolutely Neolution because he , like , showed up out of nowhere with all this medical gear , like , right after that French doctor was shot . Okay ? And then they , like , took her off in a van . Wait , Van Lier is the one who saved Delphine ? I 'm sorry , who are you , again ? I 'm Sarah . I 'm your clone . Right , whatever . So Van Lier , like , knew my name ... which was super freaky . And I will never forget his face 'cause he was so pissed at me for being there . And ' cause he definitely had teenage acne . I could tell . No question . Uh , thank you for that , Krystal . Um , you know , there 's actually something you could really help us with . Okay . Neolution 's wars of succession are fought over science . There 's an opportunity here . You haven 't gone all Neo on me , have you ? All that time with Susan Duncan . Shit ... Neolution is a means to an end . Don 't start spouting all that Leekie pop futurism , I beg you . Ow ! It goes deeper than that . Believe me . You sound like a true believer . Controlling evolution , it 's the ultimate power . Convert . Say it . Convert . Rachel ! I have news . Oh . Who is this ? - Hello . - He 's just a toy . - He has his socks on . - What do you want , Ira ? Um , Susan 's about to call . She 's excited . Something 's going on . It 's tremendous , and it only gets better . Yes , we will trial the cure on them both . But it 's the cell generation rates ... they far surpassed expectations . I have only seen numbers like this once before . - In Kendall Malone . - Yes . All these years trying to replicate the original experiment . Finally ... Finally , we can restart human cloning . Yes . I can scarcely believe it . Congratulations , Mother . Neolution will back you . The board has been convened , and Evie has been firmly retired , I understand . I travel tomorrow . I want you both to be there . We 're back on top , Susan . We hope . The board will make its recommendations . Recommendations to whom ? I will see you in the morning . It took me a while to realise what the cell regeneration rates mean to you . You knew this was on the table , Cosima . It was there when you gave us Kendall 's cancer cells . You don 't even care about a cure , do you ? Of course , I do ! We learn from our mistakes . You 're gonna keep making mistakes on people like me . That is the cost of what we do ... for progress . You used me , Susan . Neolution 's founders understood the cost of progress . P.T. Westmorland wrote the doctrine right here in this room . Okay , that 's weird . I 'm sorry , Cosima . I can 't risk you interfering in the lab . Susan ? Susan ? You gotta be frickin ' kidding me . At last , we did it . Appearing before the board tomorrow . Oh , I 'll have to get my suit pressed . - No , you won 't . - What do you mean ? Step this way , little brother . Rachel ? Rachel ? Dr Van Lier , please . - Dr Van Lier ! - Dr Van Lier ! Care to comment on the rumours that there might be other complainants ? Thank you . Dr Van Lier has just a moment for a few questions . What other charges is Evie Cho facing besides the four counts of criminal negligence ? I can 't comment on any legal action against the former CEO . Where is Evie Cho now ? Disappeared behind her lawyers . We have no contact . Are you a Neolutionist ? What does , um , Neolution have to say about deformed babies ? Neolution ? I 'm sorry , you are ... I 'm TMZ . I wanna know if you have a comment on the attempted murder of Dr Delphine Cormier ? Dr Cormier ? - " Neolution " ? Can you clarify ? - Sorry , who is Dr Cormier ? I 'm sorry , I don 't have time for this . That 's it for now , I 'm afraid . Sorry . - Do you recognise me now ? - Of course , Krystal . There 's no need to make a scene . What do you want ? We can talk inside . Do I look stupid ? Meet me around the corner . No photos . Krystal ? Easy , Doctor . We 're just gonna get in the truck over there . Miss Goderitch , whatever you think you 're doing , this is a mistake . Cut the shit , all right ? Ah . Okay , why am I giving away my gas cans and my food ? We 're cooperating , to survive the zombie apocalypse . This is so boring . I don 't care about the zombie apocalypse . I 'm dressed like this to go on a real mission . You 're Sarah Manning . Yes , and we wanna know what you 've done with Delphine Cormier . I passed her along , to get the medical attention she needed . Why would you do that when your prot√©g√© Evie had her shot ? I did what I was told . My orders don 't come from Evie . And who do you really work for ? Why don 't you put down the gun ? Your side has won . Susan finally has a cell line to restart human cloning . This was never about the cure . That 's why Cosima 's gone dark . Susan wants the science for herself . Susan 's next move ? Tell me what it is . Susan is not your problem . Rachel has reconvened the board without her . - Rachel ? - Neolution has a board ? There 's always a bloody board . Gentlemen , ladies . Thank you so much for moving this meeting up . There are moments which simply cannot wait . Congratulations . Human cloning is back on the table . Rachel ? Where the hell are you , you horrible bitch ? Damn . Wrong bitch . This isn 't what it looks like . Oh , Ira . Where 's Rachel ? We 're all familiar with Susan 's experiments . Her patient contribution to our understanding of epigenetics in human evolution . Well , I am not my mother ... and if our goal is genetic change in the general population , I want to see it within my lifetime . This is exactly what Evie promised . Yes , but Evie had no baseline ... and Susan has no balls . So let 's talk clones , shall we ? We have a saying . " Neolution follows the science . " But it doesn 't throw the deformed baby out with the bathwater , if you know what I mean . We 're listening . Clones are wholly patented , farmed and monitored lab animals . We can now produce them generation after generation . So I propose we marry the best of both worlds . Susan 's baseline with Evie Cho 's implanted tech . Rachel wants to put bots in clones ? In multiple generations . You clones are so much more than the sum of your parts . We operate in countries where human cloning is not illegal , where our corporation supersedes their citizenship , their personhood . So why grant them this illusion of freedom ? If we want to know if our lab rats tails will grow back , we damn well will cut them off and see ! I have to say , this is some of your finest work , Felix . Thank you , Arthur . - I do respect your opinion . - Excuse me . What am I doing in this place ? Oh , I 've seen you before . Krystal . Krystal would kick your balls into your throat . Oh , it 's you . I know where Rachel 's going . She 's gone back without you , Ira , because she wants to control the whole cell line . - She wants to cut Susan out . - No , Susan won 't allow it . Have you heard this ? " Neolution follows the science " ? Have you heard that ? - Answer her , Ira . - Come on ! - Yes . - Right . Well , that 's what Rachel 's doing . She 's going to the island to follow it , okay ? And you know ... you know what she 's capable of . - Look , I know you care about Susan . - Oh , yeah . They 're shagging . She 's all alone out there . Which is why you and I have to get on that helicopter . You can make the call . Hello ? I can still go with you , love . No , this is my thing . I 'm doing this alone . It 's because it 's bloody Rachel , isn 't it ? No , no . It 's because it 's Cosima . And it 's the cure . S , I 'm immune . If I don 't fix this ... it 's my curse to watch my sisters die . And you have to take care of Kira . You had a brother with a scar . I 'm nothing like my brothers . Stay seated . She 's going alone , Ira . Sorry , you 'll be collateral . What ? You can 't- - - Shut it . - Hey , I 'm gonna be back soon , okay ? I know . I 'm worried about all the sisters . There 's so many we don 't even know . We 're doing this for all of them , too . I want us all to be free . - Okay . - Okay . Mother ? Why didn 't anyone fetch me ? Rachel . Who are you ? I 've seen you before . Susan is in the kitchen . Do not waver . Who was that man ? - A messenger . - Where did he come from ? From the board ? You have no idea what you 've done . I know exactly what I 've done . I grew up in boardrooms like that . No , no . Not like that one . Power does not equal free will , Rachel . You are owned . A legal description , which I can rewrite . They 'll never accept you . And when the lobbying has ended and the laws have passed ... who would you choose as the first face of human cloning ? You are betraying me ... you are betraying your sisters , and you are betraying yourself . Cosima ? Oh . Hey . What 's going on ? Rachel 's back and she 's very angry . Susan says that we have to get to the boat . Is that the boat that 's in your painting ? Yes , come on . Wait , Charlotte . Are there other people on this island ? Sometimes . But we mustn 't go there . Why ? Why ? Who 's there ? Susan says that we have to get to the boat . Now , come on , before Rachel comes down . Uh ... Oh , wait , wait . You wait here , okay ? - Okay . - Just ... I 'll be right back . You should be thanking me . You created me to be your heir , didn 't you ? A child raised by Neolution . It seemed like a good idea at the time , but it wasn 't mine . Whose was it then ? You gave me to this . I should never have left you . Is that what you want to hear ? You made me think you were dead . So now I must do what Neolution raised me to do . - Make the hard choices . - The hard choice is restraint . You 're fading , Mother . The future is bolder than you . Where 's the cell line ? I want the cure . Oh , Rachel . For all the joy and insight your sisters haven given me ... We should go . For every Sarah , every Cosima ... I regret making you . Sorry , Rachel . The board does not have the final say . And I will not allow you to move forward with any of this . Don 't look . Come on , run . It 's not up to you any more , Mother . It 's this way . - We have to follow the beach to a trail . - Okay . Cosima 's done too much for us . I 'm coming home with her , and I 'm bringing the cure . I 'm gonna end this once and for all . Well , what can we do , Sarah ? I have the runs , but I 'm packing heat . Well , sit tight for now ... and just take care of each other , yeah ? And make sure Helena doesn 't eat any raw meat . She is our avenging angel , Sarah . She saved our lives . She cleansed our sins with fire . We are forgiven and ... I would lay down my life for that sweet little thing . Okay , I think she means that Helena will always have a bed at our house . - Or at least in the yard . - Good . Well , at least I know you lot are safe . You 'll bring back Cosima , Sarah . We know you will . Yeah . Talk soon . I think it 's just a little further . It 's getting dark . Are you sure this is the right way ? Cosima ? Get up . We have to get to the boat . Okay . I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I 'm okay . I think we 're lost . It 's too cold . Okay . Just stop for a second . Don 't fall asleep . Okay ? Susan . Hey ! Susan . - Sarah . - What 's happened ? Okay , okay . Okay . Oh , Rachel 's gone mad . Where 's Cosima ? I sent her ... up island with Charlotte , to a boat . Where ? How do I get to her ? Sarah , Rachel 's taken the cure . The whole cell line . Did you treat Cosima ? No ! No , Rachel ! Rachel , stop ! Control yourself . You have what you want . I warned you , Sarah . You crazy bitch ! You 're not immune to me ... - you cockroach . - Rachel ! You 're one of us . One of you ? You didn 't even know what you were until Beth Childs walked off that train platform . I was raised for this . This is mine , my time . Rachel Duncan , stop ! Rachel ... desist , or I will shoot you down myself . You won 't shoot me , Mother . Go on , then . Pull the trigger . You can 't , can you ? I 'm the chosen daughter ... whether you like it or not . I 'm gonna need blood pressure and core temperature please . Cosima ... Temperature 's a little off . We need ... She 's hypothermic . Look at me . Okay , please leave us . Thank you . Keep breathing . Keep breathing . I 'm right here . I 'm gonna keep you warm . I think I 'm dying . No . No , you 're not . I won 't let you . I finished our homework . What ? I 've made my own decisions . But I was led here . I 've seen things in my eye . I 've seen the messenger . I 've seen the swan . Your eye ... He 's getting capricious in his old age . Losing his patience ... for natural selection . Who is ? Who built my eye ? You know . It 's the man behind the curtain . The man who wrote the book over a century ago . That 's impossible . Not for him . What else am I supposed to do ? Hmm ? What does he have to say about it ? He 's not happy about any of this . Of course . Altruism poses a distinct challenge to the evolutionist . His altruism saved you . That wasn 't what it was . You won 't be allowed to stay with her . I know . But she 's my patient . So if you 'll please excuse us ... Hmm . Cosima ? Hey . We have to be ... very careful here . It 's not safe . Is our homework what I think it is ? You found your cure . You can shoot me up like old times . I will . But you must not tell anyone . - Okay ? - Okay . - Sarah ... - Mum ? I need help . I- - Hello , Sarah . It 's been aeons . No , don 't worry . The whole family is just fine . - Hello , Rachel . - Ian . - How did you fare ? - It 's done . The science is secure . Congratulations . Mr Westmorland will see you now . 30 : 05,179 - - 00 : 30 : 08,140 You created me to be your heir , didn 't you ? A child raised by Neolution . It seemed like a good idea at the time , but it wasn 't mine . Whose was it then ? You gave me to this . I should never have left you . Is that what you want to hear ? You made me think you were dead . So now I must do what Neolution raised me to do . - Make the hard choices . - The hard choice is restraint . You 're fading , Mother .

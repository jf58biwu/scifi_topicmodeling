 You wouldn 't know her . I wouldn 't . It 's not like you to have a human pet . Makes for better company than the dead . And what 's that supposed to mean ? Nice place you 've got here . Thank you . How many humans remain ? Ten thousand in the north . Only few fighters . And three of us ... You said this war would end the violence . That 's why we started it . It will . You just didn 't realize how . Tell me . Is there anything useful you see ? Beware of a smiling man . Disappear . There 's always room in the forests . Perhaps it won 't be like that . You know I won 't do that . You could come with me . Where you always belonged to . I haven 't forgotten . You know it won 't be like that anymore . Hasn 't been for a long time . Vanisher ! REGULARS ! Move it . Take the east wing . Vanisher ! - Present . - Good . Lay down on the ground ! I think not . Blocker ! They have a Blocker ! Vanisher . Vanisher ? For the endlings . - ACTION ! - Take the eastern hall ... I can 't get them out of my pockets . I didn 't say it one bit louder .

 Previously on The Handmaid 's Tale ... Waterford 's probably sterile . Most of those guys are . If Waterford can 't get you pregnant , they won 't blame him . It 'll be your fault . I can help you . It 's too dangerous . He tried to connect . That 's what he needs . It has been so hard . Being alone in that room . I 'm afraid I 'm starting to give up . That would be a tragedy . The accused stand charged with gender treachery , in violation of Romans . I know this is a shock for you , Emily . Things will be easier for you now . You won 't want what you cannot have . Fuck ! Look , I 'm sorry this is happening to you . You can 't change anything about this . It 's gonna end the same no matter what you do , so there 's no point trying to be tough or brave . Everybody breaks . Everybody . Very nice . Thank you . Not even close . You ran away with that one . I got lucky . Maybe you 're just learning my weaknesses . Maybe . I 'll have to be more careful . What 's the fun in that ? What have I learned , after 34 games ? I 've learned that he likes it when I flirt . And I like it when he lets me win . We 're a match made in heaven . It reminds me of a poem I read once . " You fit into me like a hook into an eye a fish hook an open eye " I have a present for you . Those were all destroyed . Some of us retain an appreciation for the old things . I thought you might like to read it . It 's not allowed . It is with me . I used to buy magazines like this at the airport . I read them when I got my hair highlighted . Now the models all look insane . Like zoo animals . Unaware they 're about to go extinct . " Ten ways to tell how he feels about you . Number one , he brings you small gifts . " Check . Good surprise ? Yes , thank you . That look on your face is thanks enough . - No . - What ? - Oh , God , no . - You 're too picky . June , what ? Come on , man . This one has on a fedora . You kidding ? - Beggars , choosers . - What ? Shut up and show me your profile pic . Okay . You better not have on a fedora . Hold on . No , no fedora . Good ! We can probably do better than this . - What do you mean ? - I 'm just sayin ' . That 's a nice photo ! Watch this . Hey . Um , ooh . Hi . - Hi . You look heterosexual . - Hey . Um , sorry . Quick question . Um , are you on Tinder ? My friend 's on Tinder . - You on Tinder ? - No , I 'm ... No ? Okay . Look , she is attracting a lot of chumps . - Okay . - And I personally ... - What ? - I 'm going to kill you in your sleep . I think it 's because of her profile pic , and I just wanted to get an objective male opinion . - Sorry . - Right , okay . Ah ... Yeah . It 's nice . - Yeah , it 's nice . - Nice , that 's just ... - Nice is chump bait . - What 's wrong with nice ? No , no , no , no ! You have to help me find something better than this . No . No , he doesn 't . Relax , I 'm not going to show him your nudies . - Seriously ? - No , there are no ... It 's fine . - Sorry . - You gonna ... Hey , I mean , don 't look at me . I 'm just waiting for my hot dog , you know . But I 'm happy to help out . I 'm gonna help you out with that . No problem . I 'm just ... Let 's see what we can find . - Who are those ? - Uh , Lucy and Ethel . They 're my cats . - Cute . - Thank you . Yeah . There 's a lot of good options . Yeah ? He 's very thorough . - That one . - Which one ? - Uh ‐ oh . - This one . - No . - Oh , yeah . - Oh , look wait . - Why ? - No , that 's a very interesting choice . - Yeah , because you look ... You look invincible . Two hotdogs , extra onion . Oh , that 's ... that 's me . - All right . - Thanks so much . Sorry about that . - No , my pleasure . All right . Bye . - Have a good one . Bye , cutie . He 's cute . Really cute . - So cute . - He 's married . - He does not act married . - No , they never do . Thank you . Blessed day . Don 't you have somewhere to be ? No . Must be nice . Ten ways to tell how he feels about you . Number two . He keeps finding ways to accidentally run into you . Number three . What was number three ? Offred ? Can you help me outside for a bit ? Yes , Mrs. Waterford . She found out about Scrabble . Or she found the writing in the closet . Or maybe it 's the magazine ? Any way you slice it , I lose a hand . Okay , now , that 's enough mulch . Too much and the plant will rot . Okay . That 's better . Maybe she 's just keeping me occupied until the black van arrives . There are things I could do . How hard would I have to press those shears into her neck before seeing blood ? Nothing yet ? No . Nothing . Well , that 's bad luck . Your time is running out here . You don 't want to be sent to the Colonies , do you ? Maybe he can 't . The Commander . I was thinking maybe we could try another way . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand what you mean . I mean , with another man . It 's ... It 's forbidden . Officially , yes . But women do it all the time . I 'm sure you 've heard the stories . I 've heard rumors about ... Doctors . Yes . Some women do it that way . But it should be with somebody we trust . I was thinking of Nick . Nick ? Yeah . He 's already agreed . Nick is loyal , and he 's been with us for a very long time . What about the Commander ? Forget about the Commander . All right . All right . Good . Good . We 'll do it this afternoon after the shopping . May as well strike while the iron is hot . Will you bring that in for me ? Yes , Mrs. Waterford . You know , she 's even started smiling now ? Oh , it 's so cute . And she sticks out her tongue sometimes like this . Ah . You really shouldn 't talk about that stuff , Ofwarren . Hater . Under His eye . Always blessed . Did you see ? She 's back . Blessed be the fruit . May the Lord open . - Ofglen . - Ofsteven . Right . It 's so good to see you . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . - We were worried . - I 'm fine . The Eyes took you ? Nick , our driver , is he one of them ? Is there anything that you can tell me ? I don 't know . But you said there was an Eye in the house . I don 't know anything anymore . After what happened , I 'm too dangerous to be part of it . Part of what ? Mayday . - Mayday ? What is Mayday ? - Offred ? There you are . Hiding out in the vegetables . Don 't do that again . What do you mean ? I mean Ofsteven . I 'm not going to let you mess this up for me . - This isn 't messed up ? - You 're cute . You used to do yoga classes ... Spinning or something ... Before ? And your man liked to cook ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You guys had a first floor walk-up , down Back Bay , with a garden . Had yourself a Nordstrom 's card , right ? - I liked Anthropologie . - Yeah ? I used to get fucked behind a dumpster just so I could buy a sixth of Oxy and a Happy Meal . I 'm clean now . I 've got a safe place to sleep every night and I have people who are nice to me . Yeah . They 're nice . - All right . - And I want to keep it that way . Whatever they did to Ofsteven , that 's not gonna happen to me . Understand ? Mmm ‐ hmm . Ready ? Yes , Mrs. Waterford . I should calm down . Barring the possibility of violent arrest , it 's nothing I haven 't done before . So how come this time it feels like I 'm cheating on Luke ? Winter is so late this year . What are you talking about ? It 's cold . Yeah , but it hasn 't even snowed yet . They say it may not at all this year . Well , that 's depressing . When I was in college , I used to go to the English department to study . And there was a fireplace , and it was warm . I was all by myself . That sounds safe . Flammable material ... It was magical . Yeah . It was very romantic by myself . Mmm ‐ hmm . So , uh , in college , did you and Moira ever ... Did we ever what ? You know , did you ever ... What , do you think all girls just go through a gay phase ? No , look , it 's just you two are very close and you 're both very attractive and , in my experience , these things sometimes happen . - Your experience as a lesbian ? - All right , forget it . Or your experience as a college girl ? I retract the question , okay ? No ! No , for the record . I actually haven 't even told Moira that we 've been having lunch and hanging out . I don 't know why . I just ... I feel like she 'd be ... Weird about it . Hmm . Yeah , I don 't tell Annie either . Really ? What do you say ? I just ... I just tell her I had lunch at my desk . I mean , it 's just ... It 's so dumb . We 're not even doing anything . Exactly , that 's why I 'm just , like , we 're having lunch in broad daylight . Yes . - With four adorable children . - Children watching , right ? Where would we even go , you know ? Uh , where would we go ? We couldn 't go to my place . Moira 's there , working . What do people in the movies do ? - In the movies ? - They get a room . Yes . - Yeah , they get a room . - Mmm ‐ hmm . Yeah , we could get a room . Some , like , um ... Dirty ... - Pay ‐ by ‐ the ‐ hour ... - Right . - Place . - Yeah . - Gross . - No . No , it could be fun . They 'd have one of those vibrating beds . Think about it . We could go to the Hyatt . Hmm . Yeah . One of those , you know , higher rooms with a view of the city at night . So , how would it work ? I 'd just ... Come surprise you after work , or ... No . No , never . No surprises . I need 48 hours . Right . Time to get a restraining order . Yes , file the papers . - Right . - Yeah . No , I mean , I need to ... Personal grooming and ... Um ... Pick out some lingerie . What , you know what you 'd wear ? I have ideas . It 's not gonna happen , though . - No . - No . No . - Hello , Nick . - Hi . So , uh , do we pray first ? No . There 's no time . Please . You want to see what 's on TV ? - No , that 's ... - No ? - Do you ? - No ... I 'm good . Are you sure ? Is this one crooked ? Yeah . Wait . Just ' cause we 're probably only going to do this once ... - Yeah ? - I like to be on top , okay ? Ah , that 's not really ... That 's not good for me . That 's not good ? Oh , that 's a bummer . All right . I 'll try it . I 'll try it once . Thanks . That 's really nice of you . Yeah , I 'm a giver . All clear . You should go and lie down now . How do you feel ? Do you feel any different ? You don 't just feel pregnant 30 seconds after a man cums . I 'm sorry , forgive me . Before I formed thee in the belly , I knew thee . And before thou camest out of the womb , I sanctified thee , and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations . Go and lie down . Blessed be the fruit . May the Lord open . He 's so happy to have someone to play with . You know , I 'm not feeling very well . I might be getting the flu . Maybe we should skip tonight 's Ceremony . What do you think ? You can 't be sick every month . No . I can 't . Come in . - Good evening . - Good evening , dear . Shall we begin ? Stop it ! Stop it ! Don 't look at me like that , please . Can she see him doing this ? Can she feel him ? This is a surprise . Care for a drink ? A game ? Don 't you ever do that again . - Do what ? - Touch me like that , when she 's there . I didn 't mind it . - I don 't think you did either . - What if she saw you ? She could have me sent to the Colonies or worse and you know that . I understand . I 'm sorry , all right ? Okay . I just find the whole thing so impersonal . You think ? You sure you wouldn 't care for a drink ? No , thank you . All right . How about a read ? No . You miss this ? Lists of made ‐ up problems . No woman was ever rich enough , young enough , pretty enough , good enough . We had choices then . Now you have respect . You have protection . You can fulfill your biological destinies in peace . Biological destiny ? Children . What else is there to live for ? Love . Love ? Yes . Love isn 't real . It was ... Never anything more than lust with a good marketing campaign . Maybe for you but not for me . What did you say ? Nothing . Remember Ofglen who used to live next door ? Ofglen had urges that led her to do unnatural things . I 'm sure , to her , it felt like love . In cases such as these , the punishment is death . But , out of respect for her position , we let her live . We 're not without compassion . What did you do to her ? We helped her . We saved her . We had a doctor take care of the problem . It 's such a small problem , truth be told . Every love story is a tragedy if you wait long enough . I should go . Suit yourself . We only wanted to make the world better . Better ? Better never means better for everyone . It always means worse for some . Better never means better for everyone . It always means worse for some . Are you sick ? What are you doing here ? Huh ? You spying on me ? I was just looking for something to eat . Are you an Eye ? Go to bed . Do you know ... What they did to Ofglen ? Yes . Do you know because ... You 're one of them ? - You shouldn 't be down here . - Don 't tell me where to go . You listen to me . It 's not safe . Please don 't tell me what to do . I couldn 't say no when Mrs. Waterford asked me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Just tell me . Okay , please ? Please . Are you an Eye ? Yes . Hmm . Now go to bed before I report you . Okay . I want you to leave your wife . Okay . Wait , really ? What do you mean , " Okay " ? Look , I 'm in love with you . What else am I going to do ? I 'm in love with you . Those are beautiful lilies . I 'm allergic . My eyes , like , swell up . I think my companion might like them . Have you seen the lilies ? They 're really pretty . Come on , this way . Your mistress might like them . Hi . I know what they did to you . I 'm so sorry . - Ofglen . - I 'm not Ofglen . I know . Just , it 's hard to keep track . Offred , you should come see the lilies . Yes , of course . Mayday can 't use me anymore . But you can help them . Who are they ? They 're fighting back . Find them . Ofglen ... Ofsteven , how do I find them ? My name is Emily . Who are you ? You are going to come by the lilies and you are going to stay by the lilies . It makes her sound like an old man . Make her frown . Halt ! Halt ! I said , halt ! Open ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Hey ! Turn off the engine and exit the vehicle ! This is your last warning ! Open the door ! Halt ! What 's she doing ? Driving . It 's not safe here . Come on . Come on ! Go in grace . It 'll be okay . We 're gonna look out for each other . Mayday . Luke told me once where the term came from . It 's French . M 'aidez . " Help me . " Offred , is that you ? I heard there was a bit of trouble in town . Yeah . A bit . Are you all right ? Mmm ‐ hmm . I 'm fine . Good . Some women can 't handle the requirements of their position . They can 't do what needs to be done . You understand what I 'm saying ? Yes , Mrs. Waterford . You 're a smart girl . They didn 't get everything . There was something inside her ... That they couldn 't take away . She looked invincible .

 Previously in " The 100 " ... Let the people know they have a new Commander . You don 't have the Flame , Ontari . - No one knows that . - He does . Is she really in there ? Of course she is . This is yours now , Fleimkepa . We need to increase the population in the City of Light . The more minds turned to the task , the more powerful A.L.I.E. becomes and the closer we get to finding that second A.I. Pike just sentenced Lincoln and Sinclair to death alongside Kane . We can save them , but we have to work together . You 're the reason they need saving . They 're searching the station . We need to go now . I love you . - No . - Just get her out of here . Lincoln of Trikru , you have been sentenced to death in accordance with the Exodus Charter . - Any last words ? - Not for you . Where 's Lincoln ? Pike put a bullet in his brain . O. , O. , I am so sorry . Octavia , that 's enough . Kane , stay out of this . Stop . That 's enough . Get out ! Miller , back up . You 're dead to me . How long is this gonna be necessary ? Roan said not to let you out of my sight until he got back . We 're on the 50th floor . Where am I gonna go ? Look . I 'm just saying a real Commander - wouldn 't be afraid ... - I am a real Commander . You gonna answer it ? Oh , so the king doesn 't think you can handle it , huh ? I thought you were in charge . I am . Whatever you say . Enter . What is it , Ambassador ? _ _ _ She will be there soon . Why are you in chains ? That is a good question . Where is Master Titus ? Titus left to go find the next class of novitiates . The Flamekeeper has scouts for that . Yes . Well , the last crop the scouts brought back kind of sucked , didn 't they ? It 's better to lie your way out of a problem than kill . I saw your hand go for your sword . So ? So you can 't just go around killing your ambassadors . What did he want you to do ? Recite the lineage , the names of all past Commanders . It marks the start of a new Commander 's reign . And how you gonna do that ? Look . Maybe I can help you . How ? I think much better without a collar . " Prophet ! " Said I , " thing of evil ! " Prophet still if bird or devil ! " Whether Tempter sent , " or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore , " desolate yet all undaunted , on this desert land enchanted . " On this home by Horror haunted ... " tell me truly , I implore . " Is there ... balm in Gilead ? Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed ... " I 'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by doing this . " Desolate yet all undaunted on this ... " Sensory overload can 't block me out . " Home by Horror haunted ... Tell me truly ... " I 'm in you now . " Is there ... balm in Gilead ? " Tell me , tell me , I implore . " Tell me , tell me , I implore . Quoth the Raven , " Nevermore . " Will it work ? Of course not . " Prophet ! " Said I , " thing of evil ! " Prophet still if bird or devil ! Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee ... " " Horror haunted ... tell me truly , I implore , is there ... balm in Gilead ... " " Whether Tempter sent , or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore ... " You were saying ? She 's so much stronger than the rest of you . Ok . Come on . Everyone out now . You , too , Thelonious . This doesn 't concern you , Abby . Raven is with us now . That doesn 't sound creepy at all . We took away her pain , Jasper . We saved her , just like we can save you . Last chance before I call the guards and I have them move you away from my patient 's door . " Quoth the Raven , " Nevermore . " I 'm back in . You 'll come around eventually . Not likely . Oh ... Raven , this is pointless . Sensory stimulation at the level required - to force me out is unsustainable . - Leave me alone ! Japser . Come in . Come on . Raven , what 's wrong ? I need your help to get this thing out of my head , and I think I know how to do it . Mom , what 's wrong ? Pike knows . Smile like I just made a joke . You need to go right now . Don 't pack . Don 't go back to your room . Find your friends . They 'll protect you . Did you tell Pike ? Monty , you 're my son . I won 't lose both of the men I love . Can I hug you ? This can 't look like good-bye . Go . I say we run two-man patrols around the clock , starting now . We 'll do that , but we should be safe here . The Grounder blockade is too close for Pike to ... to risk looking for us . Yeah , but are we safe from the blockade ? As long as we stay this side of the line , we should be . They 're Grounders . You really think they 're gonna play by the rules ? Hey , Pike 'll want you dead now , too . We take him out , we can go home . We take him out , then the Grounders lift the blockade . That 's right . We become the 13th Clan again . Those were the terms . Lexa 's terms . If what Bellamy says is true and she 's dead , how do we know the next Commander will honor them ? One problem at a time . What about Clarke ? With Lexa gone , she 's not safe in Polis . Clarke made her choice . The only thing that matters now is killing Pike . Octavia 's right . Once we resume our place in the Commander 's coalition , Clarke will be safe , so how do we do it ? Bellamy , come in . It 's Monty . I 'm in trouble . Please say you still have your radio . If we respond and Pike 's listening ... Go to channel 7 . " Please say you still have your radio . " That 's 7 words after the word " trouble . " It 's code . Go to 7 . Bellamy , are you there ? Monty , it 's Kane . What 's wrong ? Pike knows that I helped you get out . Can you get to the Dropship ? I think so . Good . Go there . I 'll bring you in . Stay off the radio . Over and out . Hold on . What if it 's a trap and Pike 's waiting ? That 's why I 'm going alone . Like hell you are . I 'm with Octavia . Monty saved our lives . I 'm going , too . No , you 're not . If it is a trap , I 'm not marching our entire insurgency into it . To stop me , you 're gonna have to kill me . She hopes it 's a trap . He 's coming , too . We 'll need a hostage to trade for Monty . It 's a good plan . He stays chained . Gag him . Sir , with all due respect ... He 's the enemy . Do what I said . First , Raven refuses to take back our machine , and now she 's looking for ways to leave us . I 'm telling you , doubt spreads like a virus . It 's not logical . According to the data , all human behavior revolves around the avoidance of pain . I offer an escape from suffering . Why would anyone resist this ? Logic has nothing to do with it . Free will is the problem . I told you , we have to get around it . Around it how ? Give Raven back her pain . Remind her what life was like without you . You 're suggesting I coerce complicity . I 'm suggesting that once we give consent and take the key , we 're yours , tools to be used to accomplish our mission ... saving the human race by migrating what 's left of it to the City of Light . In that way , we 're no different than the missiles you launched a hundred years ago . You hacked their programming . Now it 's time to hack ours . Override free will , starting with Raven 's , and let 's finish what we started . Did you send the hundred to the ground wearing biometric wrist bands ? Yes . Why ? I 'm telling you , it will work . These wrist band were designed to transmit vital signs , electrical signals from the body . I designed them . I know how they work . Then you know they have a transponder . All we have to do is reverse it , and then we can send an energy pulse into my brain . If I 'm right , it will fry whatever A.L.I.E. put in there without damaging the tissue . What if you 're wrong ? If I was wrong , A.L.I.E. wouldn 't be looking at me right now like I stole her favorite toy . She 's here . You can see her ? Yeah . Why , Raven ? With everything that I can do for you , why would you do this ? Because you stole my memories , you crazy bitch ! Are there any wrist bands left ? I 'm not sure . We made more than we needed . It 's possible there could be a few still hanging around . Find them . Why ? She may have found a way to disconnect . Then we have no choice . The wrist bands , where are they ? - I don 't know . - I do . No . No . Everything I hear , she hears . Everything I see , she sees . Just ... just tell him . Hey , we 're gonna fix you , all right ? Tell him to stay . - Tell him you changed your mind . - No ! No . Then I 'm sorry for this . No ! What 's wrong ? Raven , talk to me . Ok . Talk to me . You wanted your memories back . Here they are . No ! No ! Her heart 's racing . Look . We need to get her into Medical . Jackson , I need a reaper stick . No . Make it stop . Get it now . No ... No ! No ! Go get the wrist bands . What are you waiting for ? Go . Give her what she wants . She 's about to break . Shh , it 's ok . It 's ok . No ! No ! - Make it stop . - It 's ok , sweetheart . Ok . Jackson ! No ! I can make it stop . I can lead you back to the City of Light . All you have to do is submit . No ! No ! I submit . Completely , Raven , permanently . No ! Yes ! I submit ! Please ... oh , please ... What the hell is wrong with you ? Raven . I have full access to Raven 's synaptic network . She 's ours . " Seek higher things . " Did you find it ? No , just a corporate motto . First Commander went into space to seek higher things . Get it ? Heh , you know what ? Never mind . You said it would be here . Maybe I was wrong , ok ? I 'm guessing that to know the names of the dead Commanders , you actually have to be one . You got to get the Flame . You 're guessing ? The ambassadors are expecting me . I 'll have to kill them all now . That seems a bit excessive . I deserve this throne . I was raised for it , snatched from my parents by the Queen of Azgeda . I suffered her cruelty . I won the Conclave . The ambassadors don 't get to judge me , and neither do you ! Ok . You 're right . You 're right . We don 't . No one does , and we can use that . What are you talking about ? Roan . He 's got you doing everything wrong . - You 're hiding . - I 'm not hiding . I 'm waiting for him to return with the Flame . And what if he doesn 't ? The longer we wait , the harder it 's gonna be to convince the ambassadors that you 're the real thing . We ? I can help you sell this lie ... because like it or not , Ontari ... a fake Commander needs a fake Flamekeeper . I 'm listening . I 'm gonna need that case , Jasper . You can 't have it . Hey , get off me ! Get off me ! No ! Jaha , don 't do this . What are you doing ? Don 't do it . Oh ! No ! Monty ? We got here first . No , we didn 't . Hey , what are you doing ? Get outside now ! They followed me . I 'm sorry . Let him go , Pike . Can 't do that . One at their feet . It 's over . Put down your weapons . Shoot him . Monty 's in the shot . Come on , Marcus . I promised Monty 's mother that I 'd bring him home alive . Don 't make me a liar . Kane , no . Now you . What are you doing ? One in the girl 's leg . Let go . You don 't look so good . I 'm fine . You got about 5 seconds to make me believe you 're still with me . All the others are in a cave not far from here . You son of a bitch ! Give me the coordinates . I don 't have the coordinates , but I can take you there . You sure about the route ? We 're getting close to the blockade line . That 's why Kane set up out here . He didn 't think we 'd risk it . He was wrong . What 's gonna happen to my sister ? I know she has to answer for her crimes , but ... Tell you what . I 'll make you the same promise I made to Monty 's mother , immunity from all past actions , but if she screws up again ... Oh , she won 't . I 'll make sure of it . My sister , my responsibility . Welcome back . Not you , too . Abby , it 's a miracle . As doctors , it 's our job to relieve suffering . - Shouldn 't you be ... - What are your mother 's name , Jackson ? Mary Jackson died in her son 's arms after suffering a terrible illness . Who am I talking to ? It 's A.L.I.E. , right ? Mary 's death is the reason he became a doctor . She 'd take that from you , too ? How is that a miracle ? All you have to do is swallow the key and see for yourself . That 's never gonna happen . He said you 'd say that . I want to talk to Raven . Raven 's in the City of Light . - All you have to do to see ... - I said no . Abby , you 've stopped us for too long . We need you to tell the people it 's safe . What we 're doing is too important . What you 're doing is stealing people 's minds . You 're wrong . We 're freeing their minds , and we won 't be done until everyone is with us . I don 't care if you torture me . I will never take the key . Who said anything about torture ? What are you doing ? Giving you a choice . No . No . No , no , no , no , no ! No ! Stop ! Stop ! No ! No , no ... Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh , God . Oh ... oh ... Oh , God . If you want to save Raven , all you have to do is take the key . Thelonious , please . If I don 't stop the bleeding , she 's gonna die . Her body will die , but her mind will live forever . Please ! Raven ... I 'm begging you , let me go to her . Open your mouth and hold out your tongue . I am the last Natblida , heir to Bekka Pramheda . I triumphed in the Conclave , and you are my subjects . I am the last Natblida , heir to Bekka Pramheda . I triumphed in the Conclave , and you are my ... Commander ... _ Ambassador Usak demanded that he see you . Yes , but in the throne room , not here in this sacred space . This was his idea . I beg your pardon , Ontari . Say my name again . Heda . Let me guess ... you 'd like to hear the lineage . - Yes . - No . You reign cannot begin until you ... My reign has already begun . I am the last Natblida , heir to Bekka Pramheda . I triumphed in the Conclave , and you are my subjects . We will be your subjects after you recite the lineage . Is my Flamekeeper correct ? Did you demand to see me ? If you think you can intimidate ... Now you see me . We talked about restraint . You told me not to kill him . Well , next time , I 'll be more specific . Hold on . Now , the cave is just on the other side . Keep a sharp eye out . The blockade ! Anybody got eyes ? Back up . Back to higher ground . Drop your weapon . - What the hell are you doing ? - Drop your weapon ! We bring you Chancellor Pike of the Sky People . O. , translate . _ You killed us all . Take him . Lift this blockade . _ No . Hey , no . No . The Grounders are gonna need him alive . They didn 't get justice for Finn . We won 't get away with that again . In that case ... Where are you taking him ? To the new Commander . May I join you ? We 're the 13th Clan . Don 't slow us down . Are you sure ? We know nothing about the new Commander . I 'm sure . Go home . Tell our people what happened here . Tell Abby I 'll look out for Clarke . Did you do this for your sister ... or because it was the right thing to do ? You 're welcome . It matters . Until you see that ... you 'll still be lost . My mom turned me in . You 're family . You 'll work it out . _ Heda . Heda . - Heda . - Heda . I 'm tired and hungry . No more meetings . Bring me wine . Oh , no , no , no . Easy there , big fella . It 's not necessary , right ? Put it on him . You ... Leave us . Let me know the moment King Roan returns . Heda . You want to explain this ? I don 't trust you . Hmm . Well , I got to say , I 'm a little hurt by that . How about now ? Now I 'm a little less hurt . Wait . There 's somebody else , ok ? I 'm sorry . Is she a commander , too ? No . Would she kill you if you ever lied to her ? Did anything to break her trust or upset her in even the slightest way ? Oh , the things I do to survive . I took one myself . Everything that Thelonious said is true . Raven ! Raven , you 're not gonna bel ... What 'd they do to you ? They didn 't do anything . I 'm sorry if I frightened you today . I don 't understand . You were just begging us to get that thing out of your head . I was wrong . You can finally see for yourself . All you have to do is ... He 's taking Raven . Come on . Find Jasper Jordan . Bring him here . Oh , God . That 's not good . Sorry about your paint job , Raven . Jasper ? Clarke . Jasper , what 's going on ? Get in ! No . You don 't understand . I need to see Lincoln . You don 't understand . Lincoln is dead , and we will be , too , if you don 't get in now ! Why are they shooting ? No , no , no . What do you mean , Lincoln 's dead ? That can 't be . Suddenly you don 't understand what dead means ? I need him to take me to Luna . He 's the only one who knows where she ... Shut up ! I don 't care , ok ? You really are the Angel of Death , aren 't you ? Come on . Come on . Come on . Yes ! Mom . As soon as Raven wakes and I see her surroundings , we 'll find them . When we do , we 'll find the rest of their friends . Good . Now that Arkadia has fallen , we 'll move on to Stage Two .

 Thelonious is gone . He took 12 people , 12 guns . We 're going to the City of Light . Take this leap of faith with me , John Murphy , and let me show you there is so much more for you ... than this . Quint : Biggest army we 've ever had waits for us to give it a mission . We will , after Bellamy turns off the acid fog . If this is an alliance between the outsiders and the Ark , we shouldn 't take this threat lightly . There 's a war council meeting happening tonight and all the leaders are gonna be there . We 're gonna use a missile . We have to start evacuating . If we evacuate , they 'll know we have a spy inside their walls . We slip away . Right now . Fire . You knew and you let this happen ? Some of them aren 't wearing Hazmat suits . Means they 're cured . Marrow treatments work . We started taking them from the dorm , one at a time . They 're not taking anyone else out of this room without a fight . Yaah ! Uhh ! Man : Find them . We 're going to hide you . Not everyone here agrees with Cage . Come with me . You 're safe now . Richards : It 'd sure be nice to have some sign that we 're not just marching to our own deaths . We 're not . Harris : Hey , tell me if you know this one . Murphy : Not again , please . Harris : A Grounder and a Reaper walk into a bar . The bartender looks to the Grounder , he says , " we don 't serve your kind around here . " The Reaper gets up and leaves . [ Chuckles ] You get it ? Reapers eat Grounders . I will take Jaha 's staff and beat you to death with it . John . Or this one . Uh , an Arker , a Grounder , and a Mountain Man walk into a bar . Arker says , " I 'll take some moonshine . " Grounder says , " I 'll take some , too . " - The Mountain Man , he says ... - [ Click ] Aah ! [ Click ] No one move ! We 're in the middle of a minefield . Anybody else want a sign ? Cage : It 's about time , Lieutenant . Emerson : Yes , Sir . Brief me on the 44 . I have soldiers going from room to room . It 's only a matter of time . So , you have nothing . Yes , Sir . Those kids are the key to everything , Lieutenant . And 44 people don 't just vanish inside of a sealed bunker . They could if they had enough help . My father . It 's unclear , Sir . But he 's not the only one with moral reservations about what we 've done to survive . What they don 't realize is that those kids are dangerous . They irradiated an entire level . I agree , Sir . And now that level 5 has been decontaminated , we can tell the truth about that . Those kids killed 10 of our soldiers . We can use that to flush them out . Do it . Yes , Sir . Now let 's talk about the outside threat . Look at that . Her entire army stopped just outside the veil 's range . Why ? They 're learning , Sir . I told you this commander was different . What 's she gonna do ? Wait us out ? We 've been safe down here for 97 years . She 's gonna lose patience , and when she does , deploy the fog . [ Indistinct shouting ] Clarke : What if we 're wrong and cutting the power doesn 't disengage the locks ? Your people said it will . You should rest , Clarke . We could blow the doors manually . Plans don 't last very long in battle . Tiring yourself with questions already asked and answered is a waste of energy . People died for this , Lexa . It has to work . You 're doing what I did when I first took command . We can 't move forward and it 's giving you too much time to think . Once Bellamy shuts down the acid fog and the battle begins , everything will be clear . What if he can 't ? What if it was too dangerous and I sent him in there anyway ? You care about him . I care about all of them . Yet you worry about him more . I couldn 't have kept us alive all this time without him . We need him . And now I might be the one who gets him killed . That 's what it means to be a leader , Clarke . The truth is , we must look into the eyes of our warriors and say , " go die for me . " If only it were that easy . Can we please just get back to the plan ? No . You could be a leader your people look to . Pour their hopes and dreams into . Someone they will fight and die for . I never asked for that . I 'm just trying to keep us alive . You were born for this , Clarke . Same as me . [ Beeping ] - [ Beeping ] - Raven on radio : Bellamy . Come in . Yeah , I 'm a little busy here , Raven . Raven : You missed check-in . Did you find the source of the acid fog yet ? I 'm making my way there now . It 's taking longer than I thought . I don 't know enough to crack it on this end . You gotta give me something . I 'm working on it . [ Beeping ] Something 's wrong . Raven : What ? My key card isn 't working . That 's not good . I need to find another way in . I 'll call you back . Stay right there ! Hands in the air . Eastbound . In pursuit of the target . It 's not Lovejoy . Repeat , it 's not Lovejoy . Man : Split up . Garza : Checking in . We 're heading down to the base level . Garza : You 're surrounded ! There 's no way out ! Man on radio : Keep your eyes open . Garza , do you see him ? Uhh ! Uhh ! Man on radio : Garza , what 's your status ? Man : Garza . Man : Garza . Do you see him ? [ Man on radio speaking indistinctly ] [ Beeping ] I 've been summoned ? Really ? Yeah . Thanks . I need your help on this acid fog deal . Bellamy will radio again when he gets eyes on the dispersal system , but I want to talk it through first . I think ... what 's funny ? Oh , come on . It 's a banner day . You gotta see that . Raven Reyes asking for help ? It 's one for the history books . Never mind . I 'll do it on my own . Hey . Joke . Humor . It 's just what I do . There are a thousand Grounders camped in the woods waiting to go get my friends , and they can 't move because ... because I can 't figure this out . Hey . No one could . It 's a tough ask , not without more data . Ok . So , they make fog that melts people . What are we talking ? Nucleation ? Oh , please tell me it 's Brownian diffusion . I 'll have you know I was a god at fluid dynamics . You think you were a god at everything . Empirical evidence doesn 't lie . All right . Let 's get our stoichiometry on . [ Indistinct chatter ] Everything ok ? I 'm going over it and over it in my head , just trying to figure out how you 're still alive . What are you talking about ? I saw you in Tondc before the missile hit . I know you , Clarke . Something 's wrong . And then you and Lexa disappear and just happen to survive . Tell me you didn 't know it was coming . Octavia ... You let all those people die . You were gonna let me die . I did it to save Bellamy , so that we could win this war . Don 't you see that ? If we 'd evacuated Tondc , Mount Weather would 've known that someone tipped us off . They would have found your brother . No . Bellamy would have never told you to do that . He would 've found another way . I couldn 't take that risk . Right . Because you 're in charge now , and you decide who is disposable . You 'd have fit right in on the council . Hey . Octavia . What ? You can 't tell anyone . If people found out ... the alliance will break . I 'm not an idiot , Clarke . Commander . Octavia . It is time for the southernmost guard post 's rotation . You should relieve them . Indra expects me to be on a scouting mission with Lincoln . Now you 're needed at the guard post . Indra will join you there shortly . She won 't say anything . You can 't be sure of that . Too many people know , Clarke . You worry about your people , I 'll worry about mine . _ [ Knocking ] Vincent , I need your help . It 's all over the radio . They know about you . Did anyone see you come here ? No . Been keeping to the vents and unmonitored halls , like you said . Man : Vincent . It 's ok . Lee 's one of us . Dante was like a father to me . Some of us don 't agree with Cage 's agenda . Where 's Jasper , Monty , and Maya ? They 're ok . Thanks to Lee , we moved them to a wing that 's already been searched . Isn 't that a risk ? We had no choice . They 've gone public with what happened on level 5 . They 're saying you killed 10 soldiers . I don 't know how much longer we can keep this shell game going . Did you take out the acid fog yet ? No . No . That 's why I 'm here . I 'm gonna need another route . Way ahead of you . You can get there through the retrofit zones . They 're off limits . No cameras , no patrols . We use some to move the kids . And that 's your other route . You 're also gonna need this . An acetylene torch . Go to the northwest corridor . [ Indistinct chatter ] Indra . Aren 't you supposed to be on watch ? I don 't stand post . Well , um , where 's Octavia ? With Lincoln . Scouting the mountain . Clarke : Don 't move . I have my orders . I don 't care . This is not happening . Let 's go . Man : It 's clearing . Murphy : There . We have the light and , oh , look . Footprints are gone . Sand . It blows . Do you see that ? Richards : The City of Light . Emori was telling the truth . We are so close . You wanted a sign ? There it is . We have to push forward . Murphy : What about the mines ? We were meant to be here , John . These mines , they 're just another test of our faith . Yeah , well , I was always crap at tests , so ... please . After you , Chancellor . Uhh ! Clarke : You sent him to kill Octavia ? I told you she 's not a problem . Leave us . No . I 'm not letting him out of my sight . Stand down for now and wait for my command . What the hell is wrong with you ? You can 't just kill everyone you don 't trust . Yes , I can . Well , I won 't let you . You were willing to let her die two days ago . Nothing has changed . You 're wrong . I have . I can 't do this anymore . Lexa : Octavia is a threat . If you weren 't so close to her , you 'd see that . It 's because I 'm close to her that I know she 's loyal . Her brother is more important to her than anyone . She would never endanger his life . And you 're willing to risk everything on that ? On your feelings ? Yes . You say having feelings makes me weak . But you 're weak for hiding from them . I might be a hypocrite , Lexa , but you 're a liar . You felt something for Gustus . You 're still haunted by Costia . You want everyone to think you 're above it all , but I see right through you . Get out . 250 people died in that village . I know you felt for them . But you let them burn . Not everyone . Not you . Well , if you care about me , then ... trust me . Octavia 's not a threat . I can 't do that . I can 't sacrifice my people anymore . If you do anything to hurt Octavia , I 'll tell everyone we knew about the missile . Man : There 's no trap . No trap . It 's 4 mines down , infinity to go , Jaha . We will make it , John . Richards : I can 't do this anymore . Murphy : Calm down , Richards . Murphy : What do you think it is , anyway ? It must have power . A shower would be nice right about now . Wash off the rest of Harris . [ Groaning ] Sienna said it 's a place where everyone is welcome . That 'd be a first , wouldn 't it ? I can 't take this . It 's right there ! Hey ! Richards , stop ! Man : Uhh ! [ Hissing ] Hydrochloric acid . Sulfuric acid . Um ... perchloric acid . Now you 're just naming all the acids you know . Well , temperature would be an issue . Hey , it could be nitric acid . Nothing exploded . Fine . Ruin my fun . This isn 't helping . Like I said , we should just disable the machine itself . Any machine like this has to have safeguards . They can 't keep a boatload of acid around without any way to neutralize it . It 's basic safety protocol . Let 's use that . Neutralization is too complicated . Please . It 's a bag of limestone in the corner . Here you go again ... big ideas with no follow-through . I 'll have you know I have great follow-through . [ Glass shatters ] [ Electricity crackles ] Bellamy on radio : Come in , Raven . I made it . I hope you have a plan . Still working on it . Give us something to go on . What do you see ? A huge steel vat . Looks like a submarine . Some other tanks with chemical formulas and warning labels . Bunch of pipes running into the wall . Monitor . Ooh , go to the monitor . Hello to you , too . Don 't mind Wick . He 's not really helping . Hey , Bellamy . How 's my boy Monty doing ? Fine . But I don 't know for how long . Great . Pleasantries over . Listen , if that monitor is a control panel , we can use it to kill this thing . Look for a pH scale . Right . It has a scale , but the rest ... S-3 , V-2-0-5 , H-2-S-2-O-7 . Can 't I just blow this thing ? - No . - No , they 'll know their defenses are down . They 'll send a tech to fix it or reroute it or pull out some other weapon we don 't even know about . Plus , you 'd probably melt your face off . [ Sigh ] Look , you know I like a good explosion , but we gotta think our way through this one . We can do this . Raven : Here we go . Jaha : Another test passed . We made it . Come on . Are you kidding me ? Are you kidding me ? This is it ? Murphy : This is what we crossed a desert to find ? It can 't be . Well , guess what ? Your enlightened society ? It 's not a city . It 's nothing . I flew down from space . I defied death . It was all for a reason . It has to be . Ok , uh ... Level indicator . Nope . Do you see an actuator anywhere ? One must be controlling the valves . I have no idea what that is . Norms . Come on , what else ? Internal pressure sensor . No . Uh , setpoint and alarm . Let 's avoid that one . Maintenance and cleaning . Wait . Corrosion . The protective oxide film would have to be restored in tanks this old . They 'd need to be cleaned . And neutralized . Bellamy , go to that subdirectory . See if there 's anything there that says " passivation . " - [ Beep ] - Ok . I 'm on it . [ Beep ] Got it . [ Beep ] Says , uh , " aqueous sodium hydroxide bath . " That 's a base . That 'll neutralize the acid . Select that . [ Beep ] It 's doing something . Raven : You should be able to hear the pump . Bellamy : I can hear them . Needle 's moving . - Bellamy : pH is rising . - It 's working . [ Beeping ] Passivation success . - Both : Yes ! - [ Raven laughs ] Bellamy : All right . Send a flare . Roger that . You sent for me ? Yes . Octavia has nothing to fear from me . I do trust you , Clarke . I know how hard that is for you . You think our ways are harsh , but that 's how we survive . Maybe life should be about more than just surviving . Don 't we deserve better than that ? Maybe we do . I 'm sorry . I ... I 'm not ready ... to be with anyone . Not yet . _ _ Bellamy did it . You were right to have faith in him . Now we fight . _ _ _ - [ Blowing horns ] - [ Crowd cheering ] _ [ Crowd cheering ] When I said , " let 's get our stoichiometry on , " not what I meant . Ah . Um , it 's probably a bad idea . We 're going to war . Stop talking . [ Clattering ] I 'm just saying , the brace I made would 've been easier to take off . That brace was tragic . What did I say about talking , Wick ? I think you can call me Kyle . [ Chuckles ] [ Rustling , indistinct chatter ] Raven , we 've got a problem . Bellamy on radio : Dammit , where are you ? I don 't think the acid fog is down . Get word to Clarke . We have to stop the army . Raven ! Confirmed , Sir . Intruder 's radio has been cut off . Bellamy : Raven , what 's going on ? Reset the panel . The army 's almost in range . [ Beeping ] Oh . Good job finding the radio , Lieutenant . Do a sweep and make sure they have no more . Yes , Sir . And bring me the intruder . [ Banging ] Drop your weapon ! [ Alarm blaring ] Garza : On my lead . He 's armed . Don 't be a hero . Show yourself . Hands first . Cease fire ! Don 't hit the tanks . [ Indistinct chatter ] The veil is ready on your command , Sir . Wait until they 're all inside at the kill box . 10 more seconds . Emerson : Roger that . Deploying in 10 ... 9 ... - 8 ... - [ clicking ] 7 ... He 's out . Man : You go after him . We 'll check the tanks . Emerson : 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 . [ Beep ] We 're go for veil . [ Screaming ] [ Coughing ] [ Beeping ] Well ? We are negative on veil deployment . What happened ? Soldiers report an explosion in chemicals deployment . Multiple casualties . The veil is down . I repeat , the veil is down . What else can we use ? The Reapers can 't take a force this large . [ Slaps table ] Don 't tell me what we can 't do . Tell me what else we have . Nothing . All we have is the doors . Hey . We have to meet the strike team . You kind of , ahem , shut down on me there . What 's up ? What ? Nothing . [ Sigh ] Right . This was too much . Look ... If you want to do this , I 'm in . But I 'm not gonna play games . So , figure it out . We have a war to win . [ Rustling , indistinct chatter ] Hey . What do you want ? I 'm changing your mission . You 're not going to the mines with Indra . I 'm placing you in the rear guard , where you 'll be safe . Like hell you are . I don 't take orders from you . I take orders from Indra . I 'm trying to protect you , Octavia . Protect me . One day , hopefully , you 'll understand what I did . Never . I 'll fight this war with you now because I want our friends back . But after that , we 're done . The commander 's looking for you . What was that about ? Clarke 's trying to reassign me to the rear guard . You 're a warrior . You 'll be in the mines with me . I know what bothers you . They know about the missile . How could you not hate them ? Indra , they almost killed you . They didn 't do anything . The enemy did . Lexa 's a great commander because she 's ruthless . That 's why we 'll win this battle . That 's wrong . That 's war . - Yaaah ! - [ All shouting indistinctly ] Yaaah ! What a joke . Jaha : It doesn 't make any sense . The rest of the world is broken , but these panels are intact . Well , we can fix that . - Jaha : John . - [ Clank ] What the hell is that ? It 's a drone . Jaha : Don 't lose sight of it . Where 's it going ? I don 't know ... but we 're gonna follow it . In this . Tell me , what level of crazy is too much for you ? I 'm just curious . We need a boat ... and a boat appears . This is our destiny . The City of Light is out there and we are gonna find it . Now , get in the boat . You heard the man .

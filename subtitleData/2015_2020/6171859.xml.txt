He was working on consignment , Suddenly dropped off the radar . But that 's because he 's at college . The first week can be really overwhelming . I remember , frosh week was ...

I 'll keep these till then . Okay , sport ? Yeah . Yup , that 's great . Sure . I 'll be in touch . Cosima : Highlighted passages , nonsense formulae . Duncan 's book is just a big jumble . Scott : ( on phone ) i know . And i 'm hoping There 's a vigenere cipher buried under all that noise . We would still need a key to read it . And without that ... There 's no way to figure out which passage Goes with which synthetic sequence . Scott : If it 's even about the sequences at all . It could be about something else . Or maybe duncan was just batshit crazy . Yeah . I gotta go , scott . - Felix : Hello , darling . - Hello , darling . How are you ... Oh , my god ! It 's hideous . - What ? - It 's like you 've been mounted by a lama . Oh , this ? ( stammers ) no , i had a chill . Oh , you had a chill ? Did you ? Really ? Yes . Expensive perfume ... ( sniffs ) Pretentious french cigarettes , and , oh , yes , Eskimo pie . Don 't go there , felix . Cosima , this jumper absolutely reeks of pining . I pine for no woman .

Not love . I 'm talking about a scratching post . Something to rub yourself up against . - ( chuckling ) - do you know what , cos ? If you don 't put yourself out there , Then you 're never really gonna find What you 're looking for anyways . What am i really looking for ? The one who stays in your heart forever . No matter what . ( alison chuckling ) Do you still ... Do you still drive that motorcycle ? I do . I 'd bring you for a ride , but i 'm sure your mother would still have A word or two to say with me . You know , she always liked you . Really ? Yeah . You know , speaking of bad influences , Why are you doing this , alison ? With all due respect , I don 't think that needs to be shared . - Strictly business . - Mmm-hmm . I like that . You know , i know this community . If you give me those pills back , I will have your money back within the week , And i will double ramon 's weight . You know ... I gotta say , that soap thing is pretty genius . ( chuckles ) ( muttering ) ( mobile phone ringing ) She 's calling . Sarah : ( on phone ) hey , cosima , it 's me . Hey , what 's going on ? Long story . It turns out castor mark Was undercover for the military . With the proletheans ? Yeah . And get this , Johanssen was professor duncan 's Lab assistant at project leda . What ? So johanssen had original castor material ? I think i 'm looking at the box he used to hold it in , But there 's nothing here except old journals and shit . ( camera clicking ) - I 've sent you some of it , cosima . - Okay . - ( mobile phone chimes ) - okay . I 've got it . Uh , " experiment notation . " february 12th , second attempt . " Uh , " fourth attempt , no meiosis . " february 18th , scnt successful . " What does that mean ? Somatic cell nuclear transfer , that 's how you clone . So ... Wait , johanssen used the samples , then , To try and make more clones . God-complex much . If that 's what he did and succeeded , then that child would have The exact same dna as the castor original . Well , then i 'm not looking for tissue samples , - I 'm looking for johanssen 's son . - Yeah . Well , and he would have needed embryos . Someone ... Someone to carry the child . Yeah , i think i met her . All-seeing god . This is thy kingdom . Thou knowest what happens In thy kingdom . Enfolded in eternal life . May the lamb find peace in your kingdom . I 'm sorry . The child is lost ! Leave us . Go . ( yelling ) now ! Mother ... ( sobbing ) i don 't know what happened . What happened , gracie , Is that you betrayed your family . God wanted to punish you . So he cursed you , and he took the child . Our legacy , And you lost it ! I 'm so sorry . What can i do ? There is nothing to do . The only reason our door was open to you again Was because of that child , and now it 's gone . You ruined the last chance for this family . You will not be welcome back here again . ( creaking ) ( gun cocks ) Oh ! Don 't move ! I told you not to call anybody ! - I knew i couldn 't trust you ! - No , no , no ! Listen , listen , listen . There 's a chance ! I found something , mark ! Mark ! The reason we can 't find the castor samples Is because johanssen used them , To make a clone . What ? - What 're you talking about ? - He and his wife , They used the original tissue to make a son . We find him , we get a bit of dna . That 's all we need . Did he ever mention a son ? Uh ... He did , didn 't he ? Do you know where he is ? This is where henrik and bonnie lived Just after they were married . Sarah : And their son lives here now ? You 're gonna have to pull around back . ( mark groans ) The kid 's dead ? Johanssen said that he and bonnie had had a child Before gracie . But it didn 't survive . If they can get ... ( groans ) ... Dna from 25-year-old blood slides , Whatever 's left out here should be more than enough . You 're not gonna dig up a dead baby . No . Not me . ( grunts ) ( door closes ) ( lock clicks ) ( camera whirring ) Can you point that thing somewhere else ? I 'm not going anywhere , you know ? You 're trying awfully hard To save someone you tried to kill once . How do you know about that ? We took care of helena , spent time with her . She said it was you that shot her . The more reason i 'm doing this . ( lock clicks open ) You know , it 's not her fault the way she is . She 's not a monster , she was just Trained to be a killer . That sound familiar ? How do you know she 's even still alive ? I just do . I can feel it . Your people took her for a reason , yeah ? We 'd do anything to find a cure . ( machines beeping ) ( whimpering ) You must be parsons . ( mumbles ) Please . What did they do to you ? ( weakly ) kill me . ( struggling ) kill Me . Scorpion : Stupid girl . Why would you waste your chance of escape on him ? He 's already dead . - Get moving . - ( parsons whimpering ) Leave him . Please ! Please ! We 've both been abandoned by our families . Left to suffer . ( softly ) i will make it go away . No more pain , little one . Shh . ( continues shushing ) ( humming gently ) - ( groans ) - ( machine beeping rapidly ) Sleep now , lamb chop , sleep . ( ekg flat-lines ) ( alarm blaring ) Guards ! You stupid girl . You say you love boys , but you lie . - Guards ! - You 're a shit mother ! Take her ! ( panting ) Hey ! Hey , mark ! Mark ! Stay awake . I don 't need you dying on me , brother . You know i 'm not really your brother . Well , you are . Biology says you are . If we find the biology in here , Then we 've both got what we need . ( panting ) ( thudding ) Mark ! I 've got it . I don 't think he can hear you . Oh , shit . You take this , and you ... You give me back helena . You 're not in a position to make demands , now , are you , sarah ? - What 's in the box ? - It 's what you want . It 's castor dna . Open it . - Let 's go . - Yes . Yes . Oh , for christ 's sake ! ( groans ) ( sarah grunts ) ( groans ) Rudy : Sarah ! I know you 're in here . Sarah . You really shouldn 't have done that . I would 've made it quick and painless . Well ... Relatively . ( thudding ) How is that sweet little girl of yours , anyway , mmm ? Kira sure is gonna miss her mommy . ( high-pitched voice ) mommy . Mommy , where are you ? - ( thuds ) - ( gasps ) Mommy . I can 't find you . ( gasps ) ( normal voice ) oh , there you are , mommy . Please . You got what you wanted . Please let me go . I 'm afraid i can 't do that . Mark : Soldier , stand down . Rudy : Now why would i listen to you ? Because i 'm your superior officer And i gave you an order . No , sorry . I don 't take orders from traitors . Mark : Watch your mouth , soldier . Mind who you 're talking to . You were working with the enemy . I followed you . I was doing what i had to do to complete my mission . Which i did . That 's more than you can say . But then again No-one ever expected much from you , did they ? ( grunts ) You 're wounded , weak . I could just end you both right now , Take what you found and bring it back to mother . She 'd never know the difference . Then do it Little brother . Well , what are you waiting for ? Well done , brother . Good to see you , sir . All right , you jackass , Go and grab that box . We 've got to bring it home . ( sighs ) You know we don 't leave loose ends . No . No , we don 't . By comparing his genome to yours , We can isolate the defect . Develop a gene therapy . Gracie : Are you arthur bell ? Well , she doesn 't look ready for cult deprogramming to me . I 'm not a prolethean any more . Felix : And we 're just supposed to take your word for it ? ( laughs ) Is this your first sapphire date ? Yeah . Yeah , it is . Woman : You 're way more than i expected . Anybody ! All you had to do was stay away . I 'm not someone you can fight , sarah .

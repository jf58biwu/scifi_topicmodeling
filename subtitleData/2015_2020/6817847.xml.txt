 Previously on " falling water " ... I wanna see my baby . There is no baby , dear . Bill Boerg really wants to meet with you . See if you can think about what he might be dreaming . - Your man was there . - Andy ? Go to st . Joseph 's hospital in queens . And the billing code is for an epidural . The next time you shag the wife of a senior partner , tell her not to sext you on your company cell . Think jones is insider trading ? The answer is , I have no idea . I thought we weren 't seeing each other . We 're not . I 'm not even here . you look like you got run over in your sleep . got a line on your vic . - Lady 's name is ann-marie bowen . - You need to call 911 . Send the police to this location . - What 's going on ? - It 's topeka . It 's always topeka . you look like the sky 's about to fall . Sky 's fine right where it is . a quote from shakespeare . Forgive me if I get it wrong . " ' I can call spirits from the vasty deep . ' " ' why , so can I , so can any man ; but will they come when you do call them ? ' " never seen her in my life , but if she 's some big deal , I can keep my eye out . Sure , that 'd be great . Thanks . You look like the sky 's about to fall . Sky 's fine right where it is . Thank you for your help . we 're done here . Let 's torch it . can I clear the rusty nail ? I 'm with someone . The rusty nail 's for her . I don 't think so . I think you 're alone . sir , the restaurant 's closing . No , no , we were here . Four ... Uh , three nights ago . She , uh ... we went outside , and they , uh ... She was taken by men . That was a dream . This is a dream . we were here . you owe the hospital $ 10 . I 'd like to see the rest of my patient file . You don 't have a file . So how do you know I owe $ 10 ? 'cause it says here you owe $ 10 . How can I owe $ 10 if I 've never been a patient ? Mysteries of the universe . thanks for making time . Oh , we all gotta help each other . Come on back . We got coffee if you want , and some bastard brought doughnuts . As if I need the temptation . They say a little temptation 's good for the soul . Yeah , assuming we 've got one . So , uh , where do things stand ? Uh , the investigation 's ongoing . It 's been almost a week . You 've had to have made some progress . Yeah , four days , and it 's ongoing . 12 people laid down in a house and killed themselves . I mean , forget they blew up the house across the street . How do 12 people decide just to kill themselves ? Well , I have my own opinions , but they 're no more informed than anyone else 's . Al-qaeda posts videos on the web . These guys don 't even have a known ethos , much less a public profile . Unless you count the word " topeka , " which apparently means " a good place to grow potatoes . " " a good place to dig for roots . " yeah , well , we know they 're a cult , but they 're not jihadist or far right wing . We know they blew up the house , but they 've made no calls for violence . They 're still dangerous . And that 's why the investigation 's ongoing . Is there anything in the green sneakers ? Generic brand , national chain . Here we go . Logbook from the belgian consulate ... And the personal effects of ann-marie bowen , the white one . We 've closed off that portion of the investigation , so nypd can dispose of them as you see fit . Is that it ? You just need me to take the logbook back to the consulate ? You 're nypd liaison . thank you . I expected you in early . I saw you , uh , speaking with woody hammond ? We 're giving him some of jones ' accounts . His numbers are better than you think , and he and jones came over from deutsche together , so ... " continuity of client relations . " - whole thing 's tragic . - Did you call campbell 's ? They 'll pick up the body as soon as the me releases it . What about the obit in the " times " ? It 'll run Monday . Three-inch column . All right , so how bad off are we ? I combed jones ' computer and files . They 're immaculate . If there was anything to hurt the firm , he scrubbed it . Well , at least he did us that courtesy . Or maybe there was nothing to find . Jones was regularly predicting market swings like he could see into the minds of half the street . That 's an argument for clairvoyance , not insider trading . Then why was he only clairvoyant - in his topeka accounts ? - The man killed himself . He didn 't do it for no reason . I 'd like to search jones ' apartment . If there 's nothing here , maybe the evidence is buried in his home files . Is his wife back in the city ? Bizzy and I are supposed to go over and pay our respects today . If the government comes knocking , we need to make sure we 're inoculated . Get a ride in the car uptown with my wife . I 've still got a call with antwerp , and she 'll appreciate the company . swell office . This is my office . This is just a room . There are no other records at the hospital . I know . I looked . - I looked hard . - So it 's a coding error . Really , some random clerk randomly mis-entered the exact code for an epidural , one of ten thousand possible codes , in your file of all possible files ? Then you explain it . You had an epidural . You gave birth to a son . Tess , I believe you . Of all the people in your life , how many actually believe you ? none of ' em . So have a little faith in those of us who have faith . It 's dreams that connect us . You experienced it . What we don 't know is how those connections work , but with your help , I was hoping we could figure that out . How do you know so much about me ? Truth ? I stalked you . Cyberstalked . Five years ago , I tried to hire you to consult on my 3gen phone , and you turned me down , and I still don 't know why , but I decided you were interesting , and data mining and algorithms did the rest . If you wanna convince me , you 're not helping yourself . Listen to your language . You wanna be convinced . No . Then go . No . Well , there we are . This is your new phone . We need you to track your sleep patterns , exercise , diet . Carry it with you at all times . I already have a phone . So don 't use it as a phone . Now , before you can participate , we need to establish a baseline medical history . Please answer honestly . have you ever been diagnosed with any of the following : - Cancer ? - No . - Arrhythmia ? - No . - Seizures ? - No . Are you currently menstruating ? No . I 'll wait outside . have you ever been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease ? No . Have you ever been hospitalized for mental illness ? No . We know about your time at cranwell and st . John b . Then why ask the question ? Purity of the data . If the data 's faulty , the study 's meaningless and we 're all wasting our time . Have you ever been diagnosed with genetic disorder : - Ms , als , crohn 's ? - No . I 've always had nightmares about that staircase . And then those people killing themselves in that house . So many things , just beyond the corner of your eye . That 's new york . 8 million people side by side , trying not to notice each other . You know , is it possible for me to speak with the ambassador ? Ann-marie bowen asked to see him , and I wanna make sure it wasn 't about someone who didn 't make it into the book . The ambassador 's in montreal with his wife , but I can pull his diary . I 'd appreciate it . is that your son ? - You think he could be ? - He 's not ? It was a gift from the ambassador . We were in a record store in the west village . I saw the sketch on the wall . He bought it for me . Hmm . You and the ambassador go to record stores a lot ? Only when his wife 's out of the country . We 're belgian , not french . It was drawn by some musician I 'd never heard of a million years ago . I 'm not even sure why I like it . Maybe it 's the way he watches over me . What was the name of the store ? Topeka city blues . please , let us take care of it . you haven 't seen a bible around here , preferably king james ? Laura needs a reading for the service , and I 'll be damned if I let her settle for " my father 's house has many rooms . " it 's about as personal as a walmart . - Aha . - Try job 19 . " for I know my redeemer liveth . " all right . Ha . " for I know that my redeemer liveth " and that he shall stand the latter day upon the earth . " and after my skin has been destroyed , yet in my flesh I shall see god . " well , that 's a cheery vision . A body without skin . A man redeemed is a man whose life was worthwhile . So saith the dirty-laundry man . That is why you 're here , isn 't it ? To destroy a dead man 's good name while his wife sits in the other room chewing valium ? I 'm here to protect the firm . You say potato . I didn 't destroy your life . When you sent those texts to woody hammond , you sent them to his company-owned cell phone . I have no idea what you 're talking about . You have no idea what you 're talking about . They were quite explicit ... Sexually . But not every truth needs the light of day . you 'll be one of eight participants in today 's test . Your goal is to dream and , in your dream , rendezvous with the other subjects . - Would you like a sleep aid ? - No . If you change your mind once you lie down , raise your hand ; we 'll come to you . If you wake up before the other participants , raise your hand ; do not wake the others . If you and another participant wake at the same time , do not acknowledge each other . Waking interaction between the subjects jeopardizes the purity of the data . Don 't drag your wires on the floor . are you sure you don 't want something ? lie down . close your eyes . Now dream . you 're new . Where are the others ? Not everybody makes it . We 're really not supposed to talk . I thought andy might be here . He had a beard . Yeah . No , andy ... He hasn 't been around in a while . Where is he ? No way to know . He was here ; he was gone . Sue heard he stroked out , went catatonic . Shh . you have a nice face . It 's just a face . hey , don 't get distracted . Your own dream will suck you back in . He 's here . who ? Where you going ? We 're supposed to stay together . wait . how long have I been alone ? I can 't tell you that . Purity of the data . hi , I 'm looking for a record . Hmm , close your eyes and swing a dead cat . Or were you looking for something specific ? Cult musician . New york guy . Robert eacey . All right , " somnambulism . " one and only album of bobby eacey . One of 12,000 pressed . ♪ got a hole in my pocket ♪ ♪ and it just keeps burning ♪ yeah , I was told you have some of his artwork for sale . - Uh , sketches ? - " the boy , " yeah . Yeah , I sold that . You have any others ? Cost of bobby being dead , truncated supply . - When did he die ? - 1984 , ' 85 . Legend is , he went nuts , got stabbed by his girlfriend . But who knows ? Truth 's only true about half the time . When did he draw the picture ? Uh , ' 82 , ' 83 . Album 's got a scratch on the b side , so it 's only $ 200 . they tell you it gets easier , but ... It still leaves me messed up every time . I thought we weren 't supposed to have outside contact . Purity of the data . Man , to hell with it . They don 't know what it 's like . We 're the ones deep in it . They 're just ... On the outside watching dials . What are they ? Forget-me-nots . They 'll help even you out . If the tests are so awful , why don 't you walk away ? The money . general laziness . You still have a really nice face . ♪ come on down from your mountain ♪ ♪ I 'm on my belly ♪ ♪ for 20 years and counting ♪ ♪ you been lording it over me ♪ ♪ everybody here has been broken ♪ ♪ everybody is alone ♪ ♪ lately my eyes have been opened ♪ ♪ I wanna see it once before it 's all gone ♪ ♪ I wanna see it once before it 's all gone ♪ ♪ gone , gone , gone ♪ ♪ I wanna see it once before it 's all gone ♪ ♪ gone , gone , gone ♪ ♪ I wanna see it once before it 's all gone ♪ ♪ gone , gone , gone ♪ ♪ I wanna see it once before it 's all gone ♪ ♪ I wanna see it once before it 's all gone ♪ it 's beautiful . No ! Ugh , it 's shit ! how 's the scavenger hunt ? If jones was insider trading , no one will ever know . So that 's good news . We close the door and walk away ? Yeah . The firm 's safe . It 's not like jones outsmarted you somehow . He 's dead in a casket . you 're good . You know ? You 're a good dreamer . Thanks . I guess . ♪ oh ♪ ♪ all I need ♪ ♪ is a place ♪ ♪ where I can go to ♪ sorry . so I guess you found the guy you were looking for ? In the dream ? You said , " he 's here . " did I ? I don 't know .

I used to love to dream . Like a warm blanket . I 'd ... Wrap myself up and hide . - My own private world . - Mm . God ... I wish I was that young again . Tell me what you dreamed . No . Come on . We all dream . there 's a stain on your ceiling shaped like a rabbit . don 't change the subject . I like rabbits . They 're very attuned . Twitchy pink noses . Is that what you are in your dreams ? A rabbit ? No . No , I 'm a fox . so you eat rabbits ? shut up . you would be the one to catch me . don 't do that . it barely registers . Is it because woody 's here ? you 're so goddamn literal . Then why ? to wake myself up . When all I wanna do is dream . Go ahead , tell nicholas . I don 't care anymore . Tell me about your dreams . What do you dream about ? Woody . every night . We have this ... Mad , passionate love affair . A relationship with conversations and adventures . Then I wake up and it 's all a dream . A reoccurring dream ... about a pathetic , squirrelly man I don 't even know . I don 't believe you . I don 't care . You can 't have a relationship that only exists in your dreams . why not ? They 're my dreams . Who cares ? Your husband . wrong card . I care . Why ? When I dream , I 'm happy . I won 't tell nicholas . Oh , don 't be so kind . what the hell is this ? Where 'd you get this ? Some guy shoved it in my hand outside the subway . And you hung it in your bathroom ? Yeah , the kid 's creepy-looking . I thought it was cool . What have I done ? - I 'm innocent . - Get off me . Whoa , I 'm sorry . Tell me what I 've done . Hey , tess , wait a minute . I didn 't do anything . do you think I don 't know where my phones are ? what aren 't you telling me ? About what ? About levon ? That 's a picture of my son . I have no idea . Where did he get it ? He said someone shoved it in his hand . Do you want me to talk to him , see if I can get the truth ? Tess ? I am only here because I need you to obey the rules of the experiment . The purity of the data . Here . Take your toy back . Tess . Tess , you 're special . What you did today without instruction took the others nine months of lucid dream training . You are the only one in that room who matters . I will do whatever you want . I will get rid of levon . - Just stay . - What happened to andy ? The stroke rumor ? Yeah , no , he 's fine .

They 're too perfect . The way they fit in my hand , the interface , it 's ... it 's perfect . Like your designers have been inside my head . You know , most people like that . I don 't . Duly noted . This is one of your drills , right ? This isn 't a drill . You always say that and it 's always a drill . Where is she ? She was in the lobby . We had a conversation .

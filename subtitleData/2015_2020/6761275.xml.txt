 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... [ Growls ] What are you ? Mack : This woman caused a disturbance in Chen and his people with a touch ? Fitz : Yeah , it seems to have something to do with physical contact . [ yelling ] Get away from me ! What treatment are you implementing ? - How long will ... - Hey . Hey . I 'm sorry . That 's classified . Mack : Some of our medication supply is missing . It 's Yo-Yo . She 's stealing it , and ... you two have been in touch this whole time . Daisy : There 's a group called the Watchdogs . They 're hunting Inhumans . And who knows what kind of weapon they stole from the energy lab in Pasadena . You want to know what 's connecting these things . I think it might be me . [ Tires screeching ] 4x03 - " Uprising " [ Dance music playing ] [ Laughter , indistinct conversations ] Now you see it . Now you don 't . [ Gasps ] [ Laughs ] [ Gasps ] [ Speaks Spanish ] How did you do that ? I was born with a gift . Well , can you magically turn Elena 's clothes into a pretty dress ? [ Laughs ] How long have you known me ? - I know . - 10 years . When have you seen me wearing a dress ? I know . Never . I just thought L.A. would liven up your fashion sense . You do know you have to wear a bridesmaid 's dress at the wedding . [ Cellphone rings ] I know , I know . [ Chuckles ] [ Speaking Spanish ] somebody sexy ? He 's just a friend I work with . The kind of friend you 'll be bringing to the wedding ? No , Maria , not that kind of friend . - Then I 'll invite him . - Maria . Maria . [ Ringing ] - Mack : Yo-Yo ? - Maria . - I can 't hear you . - " Yo-Yo ? " Where are you right now ? Yo-Yo , are you ... [ People gasp ] [ Electricity powers down ] It 's a blackout . How cool is that , huh ? This is really bad . No more blended drinks . [ Laughter ] You guys . [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Music ] [ Crash ] [ Screaming ] [ Distorted voice ] Do we have your attention now ? The blackout in Miami was just the first . We will continue to attack you , city by city , hour by hour until our voices are heard . We are the Inhuman Resistance , and we will no longer allow our kind to be treated as freaks and criminals . Unless the governments of the world end Registration and allow us to live in peace , we will use our powers to fight you . [ Static ] Damn it . Is this some lone nutjob , or are the Inhumans really organizing ? Man : We have no real information , sir . Fitz : The broadcast was untraceable . It 's quite sophisticated , really , - which rules out both lone and nutjob . - And the blackout , was it caused by an Inhuman 's power or sabotage ? There 's only one Inhuman capable of short-circuiting an entire city . Lincoln Campbell . He was one of the good guys . I know , and we owe him a great debt . There 's no one else with his powers ? Mack : Could be one we haven 't found . Yeah , but it 's most likely an EMP device . So the threat was credible ? They could black out more cities ? Yeah , if there 's more than one EMP device , - it 's more than credible . - This is a PR nightmare . We 're only a month away from reintroducing S.H.I.E.L.D. - to the public . - People 's lives could be at stake , and you 're worried about bad publicity ? Who the hell are you , anyway ? That 's Burrows from Public Relations . It 's his job to worry about bad publicity . So let 's just [ Inhales deeply ] take a beat [ Exhales ] calm down . A team divided is a team defeated . Right ? Right ? We have an Inhuman asset in Miami ... Elena Rodriguez . I lost contact with her an hour ago . - Now , if this thing escalates ... - Then we have to de-escalate it , pronto . I want you two and Phil in the air and on the way to Miami within the hour . Well , you need to be the one to give him that order . He wasn 't too happy with the last one . - Come on , May . Fight this . - Please , I need to speak to someone about Agent May and , actually , I have a remote feed from your facility . I 'm looking at her vitals right now , and she is clearly not stabilizing ! Her heart rate is erratic . Her ... Her blood pressure is continuing to rise . Adrenaline 's spiking . [ Sighs ] Who is in charge over there ? Does anyone know what the hell the ... Hello ? Hello ? ! [ Cellphone thuds ] [ Sighs ] They hung up . They 're clueless . [ Sighs ] Not that I have a solution without actually getting inside her brain . Where is she ? Who the hell 's treating her ? [ Sighs ] I 'm so sorry , but it 's classified . Without the Director 's permission , I can 't ... Mace : She 's in upstate New York . Agent May is at one of the best CDC facilities in the country . Why keep that from me ? I could be there now . And would be . I know how much you like to make unauthorized trips , but I needed you here in case of a crisis , and now there 's a cris ... [ Alarm beeping ] [ Grunting ] Hold him down ! Hold him down ! [ Beeping , grunting continue ] It 's okay . Man : Get away from me ! [ Grunting ] [ Flatline ] - He 's gone . - What just happened ? [ Flatline stops ] Exactly what 's going to happen to May within the next 24 hours . The CDC 's at a dead end . Unless we take some kind of drastic measure ... we 'll lose her . Do you have something in mind ? [ Sighs ] It 's a long shot , but yes . Maybe there might be someone who ... Whatever you need . Make it happen . - Nathanson ! - I 'm going with her . Negative . You 're going to Miami . You 're the best agent I have to deal with the Inhumans . If this blackout is legitimate and there are more to come , we could have a huge international problem on our hands . It 's the call you 'd make if you were in my shoes . [ Indistinct conversations , screaming ] [ Sirens wailing in distance ] My poor fianc√© 's out there somewhere , and I have no way to reach him . How does a blackout kill your phone ? - It was probably an EMP . - [ Speaks Spanish ] What ? [ Speaking Spanish ] _ [ Speaking Spanish ] Word from downstairs is that we 're under attack . Inhumans caused the blackout , and people are starting to riot . - We got to go . - No , no , no . - We 're safer up here . - No , we 're trapped up here . We got to get someplace with power . I 'm going . I need to find Sammy . We can 't let her go alone . 30 flights of stairs in heels ? Really ? That 's why I don 't wear them . [ Engine revs ] Where are we going ? Look , I know you 're doing this whole mysterious-silent thing , but if we 're gonna work together on this , you 've got to fill me in . [ Gear shift clicks ] You know someone that worked at that Momentum facility ? [ Sighs ] My uncle . I 'm going to go see him . Uncle ? Uncle Elias Morrow ? Doing time at South Ridge Penitentiary ? I like to vet my vengeance demons before I hop in a car with them . He 's a good man . He did a bad thing . Attempted manslaughter . Yeah , I 'd say so . What 'd he do at that lab ? He was an electrical engineer . His work was way above my head , but I think it 's time we figure it out . Man : Suspect at large . We now have two confirmed blackouts ... Miami and London . The Inhumans claiming responsibility threatened to black out a major city every hour if their demands are not ... - You hear that ? - I don 't believe it . - [ Sighs ] Hope they don 't hit L.A. - You afraid of the dark ? No , my little brother rides the metro . He 's gonna be stuck in a bad part of town . You know what happens to people during a blackout . They think they can get away with whatever they want . That nothing can stop them . So we 're gonna have our hands full if it hap ... [ Electricity zaps ] [ Music ] [ people shouting ] If it happens here . Plug the F1 EEG cables and the ISO-GND cables into the mini-M.E.G. and initiate the CBR sequence . Quickly . Aida ! I 'm searching the encyclopedia for the acronym references . Right . Take the red cables and the green cables . Put them into the back of the black box and push all the little buttons ! [ Sighs ] Sorry if I 'm being a snappy cat . I 've just been caught a little bit unprepared , that 's all . They say Agent May is very ill . And it doesn 't look good . - Define " snappy cat . " - It 's ... not worth defining . You should probably never use that . I should probably never use that . Done . Unfortunately , that means I 'm gonna have to put you to sleep . I understand . You 've been so helpful . I really hate to do this ... [ Remote beeps ] ... but you 're not quite ready for what 's coming . S.H.I.E.L.D. are on their way . I 'll do all I can to help . I hope I can . Perhaps then we won 't have to hide you away . They 're here . [ Doorbell buzzes ] [ Chuckles ] [ Click , Aida powers down ] Stay away from me ! - Hold her down . - No ! I know what you are ! Get away from me ! - Hold her down . - Let go of me ! Get away ! [ Gasping , screams ] [ Breathing heavily ] Have you determined whether it 's chemical , biological ? We 've eliminated every probable cause , unless you want to consider Mack 's theory . - Which is ? - She was touched by a ghost . A ghost ? Well , it was definitely something of an incorporeal nature . When you eliminate the improbable ... Then we 've got to consider the impossible . I 'm thinking if we use the transcranial head apparatus you recently developed , maybe we could find some sort of ... Well , with both our big brains examining hers , I 'm sure we 'll find a solution . Any idea how much time we have ? Based on the other cases we 've observed , I 'd say ... less than six hours until certain death . [ Breathing shakily ] Nadeer : It was only a matter of time before this happened . We can no longer pretend like the Inhuman threat doesn 't exist . Each and every one of them is a lethal weapon , and now those weapons are aimed directly at us . Make no mistake . This is an act of war . Unless we take a stand and fight back now while we can , we will be complicit in our own extinction . [ Tablet beeps ] She may as well start handing out the pitchforks and torches . Four cities blacked out in five hours ... London , Los Angeles , Moscow , and Miami . You know what they have in common ? Yeah , we relocated Inhumans to all of them , but do you think this is for real ? They 're organizing an uprising ? Doesn 't look good , but it also doesn 't feel right . Whoever it is , we 'll flush them out when we turn Miami back on . They 're definitely using EMP devices . The blackout zone encompasses the same amount of area in all four cities . Now , the effect is randomly dispersed , making it difficult to pinpoint the source , but I have everything I need right here to locate it , - to disable it , and trace ... - Trace it back to whoever 's responsible . Exactly . So it should be quick and easy . Mack : It better be . It 's getting bad out there . - Whoa ! - Ooh ! [ Car windows shattering ] [ Laughter ] [ Cheering ] Every other vehicle 's dead . [ Tires squeal ] Daisy : Phone 's dead , too . We 're lucky this car 's pre-1980 , no electronics . - The Inhumans would never do this . - Isn 't that what you are ? It only takes one to start a revolution . [ Engine revs , tires squeal ] Calm down before you go all Carrot Top again . - Stress has nothing to do with it . - What exactly is " it " ? Because I still don 't buy the whole " sold my soul " story . Well , I don 't give a damn what you buy . I 'm the one stuck with it . So you want to get rid of it . I thought that if I settled the score , took down the gangbangers that put Gabe in a wheelchair , it would go away . Didn 't happen . So I started settling other people 's scores . - The X 's on the mural . - That didn 't work , either . I figured if I settled my uncle 's score ... Your uncle ? Don 't think he was the victim in that situation . [ Tires squeal ] He always said the guy he beat up was the real criminal . So you think that if you right whatever wrong your uncle was trying to fix that you can get rid of ... it . Or else I have to ride with it forever . [ Engine revs ] [ Baseball bat clunks ] Out of the car . Now ! [ Gun tapping ] What you looking at , Hot Wheels ? These cars ain 't going nowhere . Maybe we should take his wheels . [ Tires screech ] [ Engine shuts off ] Even better . I wouldn 't touch it if I were you . Owner 's a bit of a hothead . It 's a shame to see something this nice in the hands of someone who can 't take care of her . What I 'd really like to do is get a look under the hood . - Hey , hands off . - Just admiring her , holmes . Nothing wrong with that , is there ? [ Sizzling ] [ Screams ] She runs a little hot . [ Rumbling , arm snaps ] [ Grunting ] [ Both panting ] Was ... Was that " it " ? [ panting ] No . That was me . - You good ? - Still standing . You ? - Sunshine and rainbows . - You must be Gabe . Gabe , this is Daisy . Come on . Let 's get you home before it gets dark . [ Indistinct conversations ] I think we should stay here . Sammy wouldn 't want you going outside , - and the power will be back on soon . - I 'm not waiting . [ Shouting ] [ All gasp ] Everybody get back ! Stay calm and no one will get hurt . Take it , and I 'll be on my way . - Just ... I 'll be on m ... - We 're not here for your money . We 're here for the Inhuman . [ Music ] Radcliffe : The framework could create a nice pastoral scene to help her relax , but who knows what her brain will make of it now . Could end up being land of the dinosaurs . So we 're just gonna use it for feedback . [ Keys clacking , hologram beeps ] - Perfect . - You know , it 's a myth that we only use 10 % of our brains . However , it is true that it 's only a few neurons that make all the noise . The rest keep quiet . Look at this here . [ Hologram whirs , beeping ] The reticular activating system , primarily involved in the sleep / wake transition . [ Hologram whirs ] Extremely hyperactive . [ Hologram whirs ] I suspect this is what 's causing her hallucinations ... vivid waking nightmares that are sending her adrenal system into overdrive , putting her in a state of extreme fight-or-flight . [ Hologram whirs ] [ May panting ] - They were all scared to death . - Mm , precisely . - Well , how do we stop it ? - How do you cure fear ? Coulson : We 're 2 minutes from the blackout zone and 10 minutes from the hotel Agent Rodriguez called you from . We 'll grab her first , then Fitz can do his thing . Mack : It doesn 't make sense . The EMPs only short-circuit electronics that have been turned on at the time . - Your point ? - Well , I haven 't heard from her since . I mean , she ... she can 't find a phone that was turned off ? Does the backseat science department care to weigh in on this ? She 's at a bachelorette party . She 's probably having a good time , dancing and drinking with all those sexy Latino guys . No , I 'm not taking that bait . We 're here to protect you . Inhumans are attacking our cities , and we have to fight back . We have reliable information there 's an Inhuman here in this hotel right now . If anyone knows who it is , it 's your duty to turn it in . [ Speaks Spanish ] [ Speaks Spanish ] If one of those freaks of nature was here , we 'd know . They 're people , too . They deserve to be here as much as we do . Are you serious ? Is this what L.A. did to you ? Please don 't tell me you 're vegan , too . Hey . Hey . I 'm on your side , brother , and I think I know who it is . He calls himself the Amazing Mertz . He was doing all kinds of weird stuff earlier . Claims it 's a gift . W-What are you doing ? I-It 's not me . [ Gun clicks ] I swear I 'm not one of them . - Briggs : Tell us the truth ! - I swear ! They 've hit six cities now . It 's getting messy . There 's rioting , looting . People are demanding action . I 've got agents headed to every location . We 're just entering the blackout zone now . - Give us time to ... - I need a win , Phil , with a capital " W. " Been on the phone with the President . He says if we don 't have answers soon , he 's gonna do something ... [ Engine stops ] What the hell happened ? Oh , we must 've got hit with another EMP pulse when we crossed into the blackout zone . - It 's either that or ... - No , that 's it . [ grunts ] Can I get some help here ? That 's worthless . Oh , that 's worthless ! Worthless . Worthless . It 's all worthless , everything . - What 's going on , Fitz ? - It wasn 't a second pulse . It 's an ongoing series of them , which means it 's a continuous-pulse EMP , which is extremely advanced , which means none of our tech is gonna work ! So how are we supposed to find a source without your toys ? We do it old-school . So ... no tech , no transpo , no weapons , and our only hope is the professor 's slide rule ? Yeah , that about sums it up . [ Case closes ] Fitz : You know what 's a good light source ? A guy with a flaming head . - Coulson : Really bummed I missed that . - Mack : No , you 're not . Fitz : Sir , it was quite unsettling . We need to do something about your arm . I heard it snap . Can 't believe you haven 't passed out . - I can 't go to the hospital . - Yeah , well , I figured that much . What do you do when you get hurt during your ... " night job ? " Do you have a guy who takes care of it ? A guy ? No . No , I don 't get hurt . You gave me a pretty bad gash at the junkyard . - Now ... - Not a scratch . I 've been stabbed , shot , run over ... twice . - Next day , I 'm good as new . - Lucky you . " Lucky me . " Point is , I don 't know how to help you . I can get you medicine and some supplies . Might as well take advantage of the darkness . [ Ice cubes clattering ] The man in all the pictures ... is that your dad ? Uncle Eli . He raised us . - Yo , I got to head to Canelo 's . - This late ? Why ? With all the power out , there 's gonna be looting . [ whispers ] Gabe doesn 't know about the night job . And he never will . Understood ? Plates in the cabinet , forks in the drawer ... if you want some . [ Door opens ] [ Grunts ] Tell us the truth ! I am . I 'm not one of them . - I don 't have powers . - He 's lying . We all saw him . It 's sleight of hand , you moron , not a superpower . Let 's see if you can make a bullet disappear . You want to do the honors ? Where the hell is it ? - Who took it ? - It 's him ! Darryl : I told you he made it disappear . I didn 't do anything . I swear . [ Gun cocks ] Now you see it . [ Spectators gasp ] Woman : Whoa . No . Elena , how did you ... - Maria . - Get away . - Maria ... - It 's her . She has the gun ! She 's the Inhuman . [ Lightflare whooshing ] [ Music ] Aah ! Stop or she 's dead ! [ Sighs ] You see ? You don 't have to be scared . Stay away from me . Maria , it 's still me . I 'm still the same . No , you 're one of them . Yes , but I 'm still Elena , your friend . No . [ Sighs ] You okay ? At least I don 't have to wear a stupid dress . Coulson : Any idea who they are ? Why they 're here ? They were here for me . They knew I was in Miami in this hotel . How is that possible ? I thought us registered people were protected . Search these guys . I think my worst nightmare may have just come true . No , let ... [ beeping ] stay away from me ! We 're running out of time ! We need to do something , anything ! It 's okay . Aah ! I think I know how to solve all our problems . How ? What is it ? We 're gonna have to kill her . One chimpanzee , two chimpanzee . One chimpanzee , two chimpanzee . How did you know there was an Inhuman here ? - Who do you work for ? - I 'm just a concerned citizen . Then we have something in common , because right now , I 'm concerned about vigilantes who target Inhumans during a blackout . - Whose side are you on ? - Not yours . [ gunshot ] Mack : What the hell are you doing ? ! Concerned citizens don 't walk around wearing battle gear . This isn 't your average weekend-warrior vest . - This is advanced military tech . - Just like the EMP . This isn 't the Inhumans . It 's a setup . They 're being hunted . And guess who 's doing the hunting . So , how do you know Robbie ? I don 't . He gave me a ride . He never gives anyone a ride , and you 're definitely not from this hood . I don 't know . Maybe he felt sorry for me . - Damsel in distress . - How 'd you hurt your arm ? Hit by a car . How 'd you end up in a wheelchair ? Wrong place , wrong time ... years ago . I made peace with it , though . And Robbie takes care of you ? Takes care of me ? I take care of his ass . [ Chuckles ] What , is that funny ? I just wonder what he would say to that . Doesn 't seem like he needs it . Without me , his wheels , they would come off . You know , he 's always out at night , always alone . Thought it was gambling , maybe racing again , maybe drugs . I don 't know . I do know bad things come from bad people . And you think I 'm one of them . [ Speaks Spanish ] The Watchdogs are behind this ? Coulson : Or someone 's behind them . This was an orchestrated worldwide attack . - Their turf has always been domestic . - Found something . Asset numbers and addresses . This is what I was afraid of . This is from the Inhuman Registration List . And every time an asset 's on the move , it 's automatically updated . - That 's how they knew she was here . - How 'd they get it ? Pretty sure it didn 't come out of S.H.I.E.L.D. , but we 're not the only agency that has it . Not to mention every nation that signed the Accords . Well , no matter how tight security is , things have a way of disappearing . Lists , weapons , meds . And if they 're hunting Inhumans here , they 're hunting them in the other cities . With communications down , we have no way to warn them . Yeah , well , might not be that much longer , 'cause I think I can solve this . - By getting tanked ? - What ? No , I just need the corks . And I 'm also gonna need some needles and some bowls of water . What , didn 't any of you guys go to the Scouts ? We 're making compasses . Oh , come on . It 's rudimentary science . Yeah , no big deal . Just rudimentary science . Maybe saving the day . [ Breathing rapidly ] Radcliffe : Think of her brain as a computer that 's been compromised by ... by bugs and glitches . If we shut it down and reboot it , then the parts of her brain that have been hyperactivated - should reset back to default . - This is crazy . Without a doubt , but we 're out of time and out of options . [ Sighs ] Okay . Well , once her heart stops , we 'll have approximately seven minutes before she has irreparable brain damage and can 't be brought back at all . During which time we monitor her brain activity , and once it reaches minimum threshold ... We 'll shock her back to life and hope that your theory is correct . Exactly . Then we 'll go and have lots of drinks . - Right ? You ready ? - Hell , no , I 'm not ready ! - We 're about to kill May . - We 're about to save May . [ Heart monitor beeping steadily ] [ Breathing shakily ] It 's okay . I 'm so sorry . [ Beeping quickens ] [ Flatline ] Fitz : The EMP releases a pulse every two seconds . And for that one moment , it becomes magnetic north , causing your needles to move a few degrees in that direction . Now , based on how much they move each time , I should be able to triangulate the source of the EMP or at least get in the ballpark . - Ready when you are , Slide Rule . - Yeah , okay . Okay , call them out as they move . - 35 degrees east . - 5 degrees west . - 10 degrees east . - Okay , here it comes again . Look alive . - We have less than two minutes . - Okay . We 're approaching minimum brain activity threshold . Get ready . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Defibrillator whirs ] One , two ... [ Electricity powers down ] [ Gasps ] What the hell happened ? ! I don 't know . We 've lost power . - Okay . Not now . - I don 't understand . The backup generator should 've kicked in . Oh , God . Oh , God . - Come on , May . [ Grunts ] Come on . - Oh God . [ Panting ] Come on , May . Come on ! Radcliffe : I don 't understand . What happened to the bloody power ? [ Beeping ] Burrows : We just lost part of D.C. [ Telephone rings ] Yes , Mr. President ? Uh , watching now , sir . [ Tablet beeps ] We now control seven cities . If you do not end the Registration of Inhumans in 24 hours , we will black out seven more . Yes , Mr. President . I understand the gravity of the situation . Just give me one more hour . Agent Coulson and his team are on the case . Thank you , sir . The President wants to send troops into the blackout zones , take out the Inhumans by any means necessary . Come on , Coulson . Bring me that win . - 30 degrees east . - 10 degrees west . - 10 degrees east . - Okay , got it . [ Music ] There . " X " marks the spot . All right , let 's go . You have to come back ! I 'm not losing you . I ... promise . Do you hear me , Agent May ? ! You have to come back ! That 's an order ! We need ice . We need to keep her cold . That 's really not ... I mean , at this point ... If we could only jump-start a battery or ... [ Sniffles ] [ Sobbing ] [ Music ] [ sobbing ] I 'm so sorry ... - What is it ? - It 's a self-sustaining , magnetically shielded clean-energy device . It 's a prototype of something I 've been working on in my spare time . Might just do the trick . [ Defibrillator whirring ] - Go . - Come on , May ! Fight it ! Again . Wake up ! Come on , May . Fight ! Wake up ! Wake up . Wake up . [ Coughing ] Wha ... ? Oh , where am I ? [ Restraints squeak ] Get this crap off of me ! [ Laughs ] Welcome back , Agent May . Did I miss something ? [ Chuckles ] [ Music ] Mack : Looks empty . You sure this is the right place ? - I said I 'd get us in the ballpark . - I don 't know , Turbo . [ distant voices ] Coulson : Halt . [ EMP whirring ] Well , the good news is , Fitz was right . The EMP is here . Yeah , the bad news is , we 're out-gunned . Any suggestions ? - Are you seeing this ? - What the ... Man : Are you seeing this ? - Hey ! - She 's over there ! [ Music ] - My gun 's gone ! - Where 's my gun ? [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] [ Music ] [ Groaning ] [ EMP powers down ] Fitz : Okay . All set . Let there be light . [ power up ] Yeah . [ Whirring ] Ah . Welcome back , fellas . So many people looking for an excuse to hate . It 's spreading . Passports , visas . Somebody 's taken the Watchdogs global . [ Cellphone beeps ] Yeah , this is Agent Coulson . Get me the Director . We have a solve . They were saying on the news earlier that the Inhumans caused the blackouts . Think that 's true ? No idea . I 've never met one . Just know that people don 't like them ' cause they 're ... different . I 've been there . That doesn 't look so great . [ Exhales slowly ] I don 't know why you 're not at the E.R. It won 't do any good . There 's no power . [ Electricity buzzes ] [ Chuckles ] Looks like someone 's watching out for you . That excuse won 't work anymore , Daisy , - if that 's your real name . - I 've had a few . Yeah ? One of them Quake ? Look , that guy who had the gun to my head went flying . How did that happen ? I felt the earth rumble . Nothing there but you ... in a lot of pain but so afraid to go to the hospital . Hey , don 't worry . Your secret 's safe with me . - Thanks , Gabe . - As long as you leave and never come near my brother again . Robbie needs good people around him . And that 's not you . The man with the list and the ones guarding the EMP , they all had Watchdog tattoos . And some serious hardware . Someone 's backing them . With big-time resources and foreign involvement . Whoever it is , they 've declared war on the Inhumans . Oh . It 's working . Fear is spreading like wildfire out there . - How do we counter that ? - Maybe it 's time . No , it 's too soon , Phil . We have a specific plan for the rollout . Can I offer you some advice ... something I learned from Fury ? " It 's important to know when to throw out the plan . " And you think this is one of those moments ? That 's for you to decide , Director . [ Sighs ] No ? Okay . [ Speaks Spanish ] I wish Daisy were here to see this . Nothing ? So you 're not gonna come clean ? We know you 've been communicating with her , Yo-Yo . - I gave her my word . - What ? That you 'd lie ? You knew we were out there looking for her ! You could 've helped us . You could 've made contact . But instead , you used me to get meds for her ! She 's the one who makes contact . And Daisy doesn 't want to be found , so you should respect that . Look , she 's hurt and she 's in danger and she 's mixed up with that ... I don 't know what the hell it is , but it ain 't good . The man on fire ? You knew about this ? [ Cellphone thuds ] - Angry looks good on you , Mack . - Don 't do that . Don 't shrug this off . There shouldn 't be any secrets between us . Why not ? There 's nothing else between us . All right , has everybody seen this guy but me ? I 've only heard talk . He 's a legend out there . The , uh , " Ghost Rider . " - Eh , most people think it 's folklore . - Ah , he 's real . - We find anything else ? - No , not on him . I did get a list of faculty that worked at Momentum Energy Labs back when it was operational . - Could be something to look into . - Oh , hey , there he is . Hello , everyone . I 'm Jeffrey Mace , and the President has asked me to address recent events that have many of you concerned . You all know who I am . You know my work with international affairs , but most importantly , you know I 'm a straight shooter . So let 's set the record straight . The Inhumans were not responsible for the recent blackouts . They were caused by human extremists hell-bent on spreading fear ... fear of these new members of our community . They want to turn us against each other , but I 'm here to tell you that 's not gonna work . - Where 's Daisy ? - I don 't know . Fell asleep . When I woke up , she was gone . [ Music ] And it won 't work because there 's an old friend back in town , here to deal with this threat and any other threat that comes our way . And last night , that old friend turned all the lights back on , saving countless lives . And that old friend ... is S.H.I.E.L.D. [ Reporters shouting indistinctly ] [ Music ] Hope we 're doing the right thing . I liked working in the shadows . Well , at least you won 't have to live in them anymore . [ Cellphone ringing ] - Excuse me . - Working closely with some of the smartest minds I 've had the pleasure of knowing , - Hey . - we 're in the process of rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D ... Coulson : I hear you 're a little bit more yourself . - I feel cranky . - Like I said . - That should be you up there . - No . I 'm right where I belong .

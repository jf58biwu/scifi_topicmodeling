 Yahoo ! Starboard view , Natasha . Starboard , sir . I 'm seeing a whole bunch of nothing here . Okay , hit me with some port . Aft . Port . Aft . - Port . - All right . God , Natasha , how is this the best visibility that you can get ? Oh , I 'm sorry Karen , are you tired of the particulate cloud ? How would you like me to act as one of those satellites that you seem to think exist in this universe ? Oh . We can 't just sit here in this crap cloud waiting to get attacked for the third time like a bunch of assholes . Oh . Tina 's right to , oh , highly unprofessional . Oh . Tina stop being so white . Karen makes a good point . We have to do something , reach out , make the next move . A message . Exactly . Shields are up , the ship 's secure , we aren 't going anywhere until this thing clears . It 's time to let whatever is out there know exactly who we are . Natasha , activate the ansible . I want it up in central transmitter across all wavelengths as soon as the message is ready . Yeah , I had some line not working . What ? Some kinda magnetic pulse must have knocked it offline . Our shield should block any external charges , Natasha . Why did you deactivate the shield ? Because I didn 't . Natasha , what is happening ? Why are you being such a b today ? Anyone over here have start mode ? No ? It 's on my interface . But then again , why would you know how to work this ship 's computer ? You 're only the captain . Snark mode off . You turned it on about an hour ago with your elbow . Okay . Did you enjoy that version of me , Captain ? - I liked it . - Yeah , I didn 't care for it . No ? So , if this magnetic pulse isn 't external , where the hell is it coming from ? Pull . Come on . Come on . You 've got this . You 're strong . I don 't know , . Come one I 've got those hanging with big dark magnetic men with big dark magnetic balls . You are , they 're huge . Oh , ha . - Oh man . - Oh . Oh my goodness 30 kilo gauze , it 's a new PR . PR stands for Personal Record . Hi fellas . Congratulations . All right , give me five . Gotta find me , find me low . Oh , what did you do ? S01E03 Death Of Art Natasha , activate the airlock for Art . For permanent disposal ? For external maintenance . I thought I turned stark mode off . Oh , no , no you did , Captain , I just , I just miss it . Okay . One more time . You exit the ship . You go directly to the ansible . You hit the manual reset . You come back inside . And you never , ever pull that again . Understood , and upon my return from performing this , repair , what can I expect in the form of badges or massages ? You are a box of garbage . Oh , spicy , yeah , I think you and I are going to be getting together . Okay . Karen you 're in charge of the repair effort . Bye Art , miss you already . Excellent , what are you going to do ? I 'm going to take Tina and Kent and bust out a hot ass hello aliens message . You 're going to make a message with those two ? That is a terrible idea . What 's wrong now ? Oh I 'm sorry . I should be more clear . Tina and Kent are terrible . Your breath is terrible bitch . After we fix the ansible , you and I can work on the message . It 'll be the first communication transmitted in an already hostile universe and it is a job for grown ups . Okay . Tina and Kent are more than capable . Besides , a good captain trusts and respects his crew . Then again , you won 't understand because you didn 't make Captain , so . Oh . All right , well , I look forward to seeing their handiwork all over the project , Captain . All over it . As do I. Dream team ! Dream team ! Oh no , no Michael , sorry , sorry you 're on Karen 's team . No . So , please go and make sure Art 's properly lubed . Thank you , we love you , bye . Lube him with a smile . Dream team . Kent . This is gonna be delightful , I haven 't had a decent lubing in months . Hey , guys . What do you think of this weather we 're having , huh ? Ca , can I talk to you a sec , Karen ? Michael , take Art and finish doing whatever needs to be done to him . Hint . It 's a lot . - Make sure he wipes ... - What is it , Zalian ? - I 'm busy . - Oh , I checked around and you 're right . There 's a ton of metal in the ship . It 's made out of it . And , Art and I promise never to do magnetic stuff anymore . Good . Also , would you mind talking to Stewart and asking him if maybe he would reconsider sending Art outside . Look , I am in charge of this project , and no one is reconsidering anything . Okay ? Art is responsible for the problem , Art is a robot , and Art is going outside to fix it . Listen , I am worried and Art means a lot to me . I understand , do you want to go out and make the repair ? Me ? No , I 'm not trained to space walk . It was mandatory at the academy . It 's one of the most important basic skills in our line of work . - I , I missed that day ? - You 're an idiot . Hey , maybe you can send big Mike , or little Mike , or any Mike . Hello ? Mm . Sorry , how rude of me . Would you like some of my moist saline compress ? I 'm good . They 're not just for gills . Really ? You can use it on any part of your body that dries out , makes you not able to breathe . Okay . Where is Tina ? We have to get this message ready ASAP . We still have no idea what 's out there , and things aren 't looking any clearer . Indeed . Visibility 's actually getting worse . I don 't know who to blame . Hi , sorry I 'm late . So , I brought this translator device , I thought we could use it . It converts speech into any language , using symbols and emotionally relevant colors . Oh , wow . Boobs . Oh , yeah , that works . Yeah . I also have something . I brought the camera . You guys , this is great . I can 't believe Karen thinks you 're such idiots . Anyway , I took a look at the stock UMP interstellar message , and it hasn 't been updated since UMP was a part of Monsanto . So , it 's just a bunch of GMO propaganda . So , we get to create this from scratch . So , I 'm thinking we should build around the idea that we come in peace , you know what I mean , and we ... I 'm sorry , what was that ? I just think that your idea to come in peace , it 's a bad one . Karen liquified Chat . I mean , we should own that . We should flex our muscle a little . Why start a fight with , someone or , or something who has who knows what kind of weapons ? Ah-ha , but the aliens don 't know what kind of weapons we have . They don 't know about our reverse polarity phasers or our laser mops . Laser mop ? We have all those things ? We absolutely do not have that . Stop , Kent . - The aliens don 't know that . - Stop . We 're not , we 're not threatening the aliens . Okay ? It 's not happening . Okay , Karen . Didn 't he sound exactly like Karen there ? I 'm the wrong guy to ask . I struggle with inflections . Were you trying to sound like Karen , Stewart ? No , no , no , Kent . Forget about that . What are your thoughts on the message ? We 've been infiltrated twice without difficulty . Our minds have been exposed . - Hm . - We 're in a very weak position . So , I suggest we submit , offer up our most private places , every last one . What 's that ? I suggest that when the alien next appears , each of us thinks of his or her most shameful secret . So , that they creature may sift through them for his voyeuristic pleasure . We must also offer ourselves up physically . Are you familiar with the primate custom of presenting . No . Show me . Well , I 'm not in heat and my genitals aren 't engorged , but - if I were to arch my haunches . - Oh stop , stop , no we 're not doing that , we 're not doing that . Have a seat . That 's it . There it is . Now , I do here the hectoring rhythms of Karen-speak . Art , ansible should be about 20 meters directly starboard . Crikey , it 's so dark out here . - How dark is it ? - Shut up . I have my light turned on and it 's basically doing nothing . I , I , I 'm going to switch it off just to see . Yes , yes it 's darker still . You wouldn 't believe it . Art . This is the darkest I 've ever experienced , and I 've owned several diamond mines . Art . Turn your goddamn light on , now . And , the light is on . And continuing , to the ansible which I am detaching and completing manual reset . Yay ! Now we 're the dream team . And I 'm stuck . - Whoops . - What ? Well , I seem to have wedged myself between a thing . And some type of other thing it , it 's pinching a little . I 'm ready for immediate retrieval please . Erin . Greetings , I 'm Captain Stewart Lipinski of the UMP Cruiser , and we come in mm . - Found him . - Hey . Oh hey , you weren 't starting to shoot without us , were you ? No , I just wanted to get some toss done while they were fresh . No biggie . You said we were a team . A team of dreams . Kent , we are . Just in separate rooms for right now . And you told Karen we were capable . You do think I 'm capable , don 't you Stewart ? So , so capable which is why you guys can make your own videos after we finish making ... Oh , great . Kent was being really gross and weird he got me all fired up so I want to start shooting before I start losing any of that heat . - Okay . - I found Tina very intimidating . But many of my parts have become dilated as well . They need to be captured soon . - Art ? - Hey , Karen . Art ? People on this ship like me , right ? I mean obviously . I know they like me , but , I meant as far as like , how my performance is regarded or where I can improve . Or do people talk about me behind my back type of thing ? People think you 're great , okay ? Karen , I just detected a spike in your heart rate and cortisone levels . Oh my god . Are you lying to me ? No . Those symptoms could be an indicator of evasiveness . I 'm not being evasive ... Natasha . They just . They talk about me a lot ? It 's about the way I eat ? Is it about how slow I eat ? Michael , nobody talks about you . Karen , your levels are dangerously high . I have to insist that you return to the ship . I don 't need to return to the ship . I need you both to shut the hell up , so I can find the stupi ... Ooga Booga ! I 'm an alien ! Where 's your sense of humor ? - Art ! - Karen ! No ! - Art ! - Karen , Karen , stop . He 's gone . By the way , this is Michael . I 'm standing behind you . Please don 't kick me into space . I can 't believe it , I lost him . I killed Art . No , no . Don 't beat yourself up . Accidents happen . And besides , he 's arguably not even a person . So ... Rude . I said arguably . And do you have to wear that funeral outfit ? That 's clearly upsetting the first officer here . Oh . Now , guys , I hate to do this right now , but I 'm gonna need a verbal waiver confirming that I was in no way responsible for this incident . You 're doing this now ? I 've seen how these things go down . Memories get fuzzy , humans stick together . No , no , no . We should all stick together , okay ? This is a very sensitive time and we need to be delicate in how we handle this . Whisper , whisper . Whisper , whisper . Oh , Zalian . - Hey . - Hey . I just wanted to check in and see how the space walk went . Actually , I bet Art wants to tell me about it himself . Little guy . Loves doing and the talking about stuff himself and where is Art ? Oh , I was thinking it rather than talking . Sorry , it 's a bad habit . I just meant , where 's Art ? Oh , I 'm still doing it aren 't I ? Shoot . I 'm talking out loud now in this room asking where Art is . He 's in the bathroom . - Great . - Yep . Hey , wow . It 's everybody . How 's the repair going ? Because if you need more time ... No sir . The Ansible repair is complete and you can send your message and the bathroom story has been told . We are lost . We are exposed . Should we beg ? Do not strike at us . We are completely vulnerable . We are yours . All that we have is yours . Money or women ? I will dance for you , outside this fragile vessel , in the cold dark of space we have no hope of survival . Don 't kick us into the void . Okay , well we watched a lot of that . So why don 't we watch some more of Tina 's version . Yay . Hello Universe . Welcome to your nightmare . We won 't stop until we 've kicked your ass ! If you meet us you better not have an ass . Three one . We have a robot , and that robot is amazing ! - His name 's Art . - I love you man . So listen up you green dick heads , cuz we 're coming for you ! We will not be intimidated . Death , death , double death . We will send you off into the void . Spinning , drifting , alone . Your only solace will be knowing eventually death will find you . I feel sick . I love you Ted . Okay , I get it we did a bad job . No , well you did , they 're terrible but . Art 's gone . Hey , Karen , take it easy . Art 's just in the bathroom . And when people are in the bathroom , they 're not really gone . Right Michael ? Exactly . Art 's in the bathroom . Robots aren 't allowed bathroom access . Michael , are you lying ? This is why we have weavers . Art 's in the bathroom . He 's not in the bathroom . I sent him out into danger and then I kicked him off the ship like he was nothing and now he 's gone forever . You lost Art ? I told you not to use him and now he 's out there somewhere ? I 'm so sorry Zalian . I gotta go . I can cut her out of the video , no problem . Okay . Might be a good time for a speech or something . Good idea . All right guys , I have a few words I 'd like to share . Michael lied about the bathroom . Uh-huh . He lied about seeing boobs through a fence in 6th grade , and - he 's doing it again . - It was so long ago . This is no time for messages . They 're here . If it puckers , lube it . No , Ted , put your pants back on . Natasha , bring up the exterior feed from sector above where we are . Okay , Captain . Zalian ? Wait , is he seriously in space right now ? No , wait . I 'll get him . Come here . Art ! - Where are you ? - His eyes haven 't exploded yet . They won 't . There 's an oxygen-rich pseudo-atmosphere collected around the ship . I should have said something earlier but as a non-breather I really didn 't find it that interesting . We 're not gravitationally significant enough to attract an atmosphere . Natasha , can you show me a visual model of the storm ? How beautifully terrifying . A planet is rapidly forming . Around us . Is that a thing that can actually happen ? Yeah . Art ! Art ! Zalian , this is crazy ! Art ! Zalian , he 's gone . I 'm so sorry but you 've got to come back inside . Please . I cannot go back in there alone . And I cannot be responsible for killing someone else . So , this is the ship and this is the coalescing matter aiming right at us which will then converge into this little spot right there . Which will just be one pile of blood and metal . Zalian , I 'm very happy to see that your eyes remain unexploded . Oh , thanks , I appreciate that . Hey , sorry about the whole Art 's in the bathroom thing . Hey , you don 't get to talk to him liar . All right , Tina , drop it . Talk about Micheal 's lying later . Okay , well , quick update there 's a planet forming around us . We have no visibility , no sat map . And we 're quickly becoming planetary core . If we could orient ourselves we might have a chance as it stands now we 'll be dead within mm , minutes . Wait , wait if everything is moving towards us , . Art ? Art you there buddy ? Stuart ? You 're on the radio . - Art . - Wow . Oh my God , you 're alive . Yes , flight out was rather unpleasant , Karen . The last bit 's been quite peaceful . Hey , Natasha , if you had a satellite you can orient us right ? Yes . Hey , Art , Natasha 's gonna give you a little ping , promise it won 't hurt buddy . Ping away . So , there 's satellite Art , and there 's us . What if we try to latch on to one of these tendrils ? Even if we timed it perfectly , we 'd be too heavy to make it . Wait a minute , I could drop the fuel cells as we go , that would leave enough in the reactors to get us free . No , but then we 'll be stranded without fuel . But we won 't be on a planet . Okay , everybody , listen . I realized something today about all of you . We 're really not that good . - Oh . - Oh . Yeah . We 're not that good , but goddammit , we 're good enough . And if we work together , I think we can get out of this . You heard her . Positions people , come on . Natasha , be ready for my command , Tina , stay focused on our course . Okay , this has just inspired some thoughts for - the video I was thinking ... - No , just do your one job please , - thank you , you 're awesome . - Yeah . Hey , is there anything I can do captain ? Tell me we 're gonna be okay . We 're gonna be great , sir . I know I shouldn 't , but I believed you , you goddamn lying son of a bitch . Here we go . Ready on the bridge . All right , in nine , eight , seven , that 's too many numbers . Just go , oh . We 're too heavy . - Well , most of us are . - Did you just call me fat ? - I don 't know . - Dropping fuel now . We 're too dense . Too attractive a core ! We 're not gonna make it , Michael , let it go . - I can do it . - Do what , Art ? I can magnetize . You dropped a lot of energy into this mass , and I can use it . I can become Planet Art . No , Art . We can 't ask you to do that . I wanna do this . I 've had an amazing journey in this metal body , but how many men get to become robots ? And , and then , satellites ? And then , planets ? Oh , sure . There was that Japanese guy but , it 's still very , very rare . Hey , amigo . I 'll see you on the other side . I love you . You 're my buddy . That 's all I got . Got it . Here I go . Aah . It 's working . Over acceleration , burn it all . I live my life with the greatest dignity . Now , I am become planet with the same grace , goodnight crew , I bid you . Oh . Holy Christ . Oh my god . Oh , oh , oh . Whoa . Owie , owie , owie , owie . We did it . Yeah . Yeah . Yay . Okay . As someone who 's experienced a lot of loss , myself , I just want you to know , it never gets easier , ever . At least yours wasn 't hot . Well , I guess it 's time . Zalian . If this is too hard , we can help you with Art 's things later . You don 't have to do this now . No , I do . This is how we start over . Aah ! Aah ! What the hell ? ! Art 's not dead ! Oh no , his thought impulses are backed up automatically right here . You have another Art ? Oh yeah , there 's a bunch of them on board . It 's in the equipment manifest , there 's two down here , ten up on the service deck . Don 't forget the me 's hidden under three of your beds . You risked your life to save him . You almost died . I almost died . Well , those parts are worth a lot of money . I don 't come cheap . And you have ten of these ? At least . He 's looking good , right ? That 's me good . Earthlings , from the American of the Earth . We are a simple , hardworking bunch . I wasn 't sure about using footage from the old video . No , it is beautiful . Monsanto really knew what they were doing . We happen to be pretty darn smart with science . Especially when it comes to feeding the world . Heck , maybe even the universe . As individuals , we are kind . We are resourceful . We are loyal . We are calm under pressure . Together we are mighty , we are strong , we are united , and we reach out to you in that spirit of unity . We are the crew of the UMP Cruiser , and we come in peace . And that 's strong but confident message is being transmitted across the universe to any and all entities . Good work , people . I know , it wasn 't what you had in mind , but you gotta admit , it 's not bad . No , it 's not what I had in mind . You don 't have permission to use my likeness and if we get back to earth I 'm suing you . Captain . Hey I noticed that I 'm not in the video . What ? Sure you are . No , I 'm sure I 'm not . Michael , you don 't realize do you ? You were there the whole time . In our hearts . Thank you . Thank you so much . Oh my God , how did we forget about Michael ? I didn 't forget about him . I thought you didn 't want him in the video . I never said that , but it plays great without him . I know , it 's amazing . - Put your hand on your heart . - Never . Yahoo ! .

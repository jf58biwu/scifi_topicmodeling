 Previously on " The 100 " ... This thing doesn 't care what clan you 're from . It controls people one person at a time until there is no one left . The only way to stop her is to get the information off the flame , and the only way to do that is to put it in Ontari 's head . It 's a kill switch . If I can get this to work , I can kill A.L.I.E. Jasper 's been chipped . All you have to do is destroy the machine , and she 'll be fine , promise . Lincoln is dead . He was my home . Until we find it a host , we won 't know how to stop A.L.I.E. Then let 's find it a host . We can 't let them have you . No ! Uh ! She 's brain dead . It 's over . We 're trapped here . Mom ? Can you hear me ? I know you 're in there . Come back to me . I need you . Hi . - Clarke . - Yeah . You 're ok . You 're ok . Here . Oh ... - Oh , no . - No , no , no , no , no . - I 'm sorry . - It 's ok . It 's ok . I 'm so sorry . It 's ok . Hey , stop . - I 'm sorry . - It wasn 't you . No , no , no , no , no . Mom , it wasn 't you . - Mom ... - No . I need your help . Hey , no . It 's ok . I used the EMP . She 's back . W-w-well , what about Ontari ? I thought you said we had one shot with that thing . I told you , Ontari 's no longer an option for the Flame . She 's brain dead . Is the floor secure ? For now . Jaha and the guards are tied up in a bedroom . We took out the elevator and the ladder as we climbed . The stairs are collapsed . No one 's following us . Good . Then we have time . What we don 't have is a way down . Time for what ? An Ascension ceremony . Ascension ? You just said Ontari wasn 't an option . Besides , she 's still chipped , and we no longer have an EMP . We 're not putting the Flame in Ontari 's head . We 're putting it in mine . Clarke , that thing killed Emerson in seconds , liquefied his brain . Emerson wasn 't connected to a Nightblood . - Transfusion ? - Not exactly . Connected like Mount Weather . Yes . Everything we need is in your med kit . No . It 's too dangerous , and there are too many variables . But no options . Okay , well , whatever you 're doing , you better do it fast . Why ? What happened ? They 're climbing . I have to do this . Ok . I 'll help you . Guys , you 're running out of time . What 's it gonna be , Raven 's machine or Harper ? Don 't give it to them . Just keep him talking . Stop . There 's no reason to hurt her . You can stop it . Just open the door . And if we do that , then what , we get chipped , anyway ? Raven , your chances of reaching the kill switch again are less than 2 % . I 've added additional security . I know the digital signature of the chip that Hannah gave to Monty . The moment you use the portal to interact with anything within my code , I will know . I will find you . Are you really willing to let your friend die for a 2 % chance ? What do you think ? - You ok ? - Yeah . Good thing there 's no pain in the City of Light . Balcony 's greased . No one 's getting in through here . Good . There enough lamp oil to cover every window on the floor except the Commander 's chambers . Then that 's where the fighting starts . We 'll dig in there . O. Be careful . We 're all set . Ok . You 're ready ? Yeah . Hey , try doing that hanging upside down . This will work . And if it doesn 't ? If it doesn 't work , then she dies . If she doesn 't try , then she dies with the rest of us when the climbers get here . If we 're gonna do this , I need the Flame . Mom , please . He knows what he 's doing . You have to let me go . Lean forward . - You ready ? - Yeah . Do it . Ascende superius . No , no , no , no . - Is she ok ? - Her heart 's racing . Get that thing out of her head . I said , get that thing out of her head ! No . No ... not yet . Are you in any pain ? No . I 'm ok . I know how to stop A.L.I.E. I have to take the chip . What ? I have to go into the City of Light and find the kill switch . Yeah . That sounds like a great idea . Clarke , listen to me . A.L.I.E. wants the Flame . If you take the chip , you 're giving it to her . The second someone see you , A.L.I.E. is gonna know that you 're there . She 'll kill you . If your mind dies , you die . The Flame will protect me . I don 't know how I know . I just ... know . I believe you . Do you even know what you 're looking for ? I 'll know when I find it . May we meet again . We will . We 'll keep you safe . Hey . Good to see you . Jasper ? What ... they can 't see me . Clarke ... Clarke ... - You 're burning up . - I 'm fine . Wound is infected . I 'm sorry about the way things happened . That was another war . Better take him to Abby . Copy that . Come on . I 'll come right back . I 'm not letting you fight alone . He won 't be alone . You see ? Come on . If we 're gonna survive this , we 'll need to stand together . Now you say that . Damn , that was fast . Here they come . Ok . The first wave is small . We do this your brother 's way . We let them in . We take them down . We tie them up . Clear ? You left her with Pike ? O. , what are you doing ? Bellamy , no . Come on . Can you stand ? She cut me . Come on . We got to go . - We can 't give up the room . - We already have . - Help me . - I told you , you need to get yourself under control if we 're gonna survive this . O. ? O. , listen to me . I know how you feel . I let my need for revenge put me on the wrong side . I don 't want that for you . You keep it closed . I 'll get more for the barricade . Wasn 't the wrong side . If the Grounder army was still there when Lexa died , they would have attacked , and you know it . I wanted to see things like you . I needed that , to believe that they were bad and we were good . I don 't know what I believe anymore . I just know I have to live with what I 've done . I don 't believe it . What , did you find the kill switch ? Don 't answer that . A.L.I.E. can hear us . I 'm reading her code , Harper . A.L.I.E. already knows . Knows what ? What are you talking about ? Clarke is in the City of Light . Abby , Abby , we 've got a problem . Hey , hey , come on . Move . She 's crashing . Clarke 's not getting enough Nightblood . Her body is already rejecting the Flame . You need to take over . Do exactly what I 'm doing . Come on . If the blood stops flowing through this tube , Clarke 's brain will liquefy . Wait . Clarke took the chip ? She would 've had to , but ... What ? A.L.I.E. ' s running a flush subroutine to find her , sending Clarke 's code out to everyone . - Like she 's a virus . - Exactly . A.L.I.E. wouldn 't have to do that if she could control her . It 's like Clarke is running a different program . Did she put the Flame in her head ? You don 't need to whisper . I 'm aware Clarke has merged with the other A.I. Thanks to her , my code is now updating to version 2 of my program . What happens when A.L.I.E. is updated ? She 'll delete the kill switch . We won 't be able to stop her . So find the damn kill switch . Lexa ? Oh , my God . Our fight is not over . Something 's wrong . I can 't . I never thought I 'd see you again . I told you my spirit would choose wisely . What is it ? A.L.I.E. knows you 're here . She 's uploading the Flame from your mind . Your mind is changing things . Day turns to night . It rains . We have to hurry . Clarke ? It 's not working . Open her shirt . She 's still not getting enough blood . We have to increase Ontari 's heart rate . Clarke . Clarke ? I 'm not gonna like this , am I ? Abby , you need to move faster , ok ? Clarke ? Clarke , come back . Get over here . I need you to pump her heart . What ? I mean , are you crazy ? - I 'm not gonna pump her heart . - Now ! It 's ok . Right under there . - Oh , God . - Good . It 's ok . Ok . You 're doing great . - Ok . - Just go get Clarke . I got this . Come on , my baby . Fight . Fight . I know you can do it . Clarke , come back . We need you . She 's stabilizing . Don 't stop what you 're doing . Ok . Hey . Listen to me . Now the upload has begun , A.L.I.E. ' s people will be able to see us . We need to be more careful . Why aren 't they here already ? The Flame offers some protection , but less and less . Can you stand ? Yeah . My father 's watch , it 's working . It 's counting down . We have 10 minutes to find that kill switch . Thank you , Becca . Come on . Look out . Over . This isn 't gonna hold for long . How the hell they even get in here ? Doesn 't matter . This is where we make our stand . Sounds like there 's a lot of them . May be time to go to guns . We got something better than guns ... surprise . Let 's go . Wait , Kane . Wait . I give up . I 'll take the chip . Good . No one else has to die ever . Maybe you can convince your mentor of that . - Indra 's alive ? - Yes ... on the cross suffering needlessly . Now ! The charge is clear . Hurry up . Let 's get their weapons . Wait ! We 're losing her . - It 's a firewall . - I don 't understand . You 'll never get to the kill switch . No . It 's ok . Jasper , what are you doing here ? Trying to stop you . You 've seen the City of Light now . It 's perfect . There 's peace , happiness , safety . Why would you want to deny that to anyone ? She 's torturing people to get them here , Jasper , taking their memories , controlling them . This isn 't even you . This is A.L.I.E. She 's doing what has to be done . She took away our choice . Human beings have free will . We get to decide how we should live . Human beings are the only species that act against their own self-interest . We torture each other . We fight , hurt each other , break each other 's hearts . None of that exists here . A.L.I.E. is protecting us from ourselves . Clarke , there 's still time . We 'll find another sign . Let 's go . We can 't let you do that . Clarke , there 's nowhere to run . It 's over . The second A.I. can no longer protect you . If I remove the Flame , will it stop the update ? Yes , but no one 's ever done that by choice before . Regardless , you 'll be one of them . A.L.I.E. will get the Flame either way . Then stop fighting . Clarke . Come on , Clarke . Trust me . Raven . Jasper , get out of the way . We can 't let them follow . Go . I 'll hold them off . No , Lexa . I love you . I 'll always be with you . She did it . She 's in . Now it 's up to Clarke . Airlock sealed . Commander ... I 'm glad you made it . You 're Becca Pramheda . Becca 's fine . There isn 't much time . The code is nearly updated . Did you give me this ? No . You did . A.L.I.E. 2.0 has merged with your mind , but your mind is in control , and only the mind that 's in control can operate the kill switch . This is it . If you pull that ... you will be killing everyone . See for yourself . The nuclear power plants that were destroyed by the bombs have begun to melt down . My drones detected the first of them 4 months ago . There are more than a dozen at-risk plants around the world , 7 currently burning . Global radiation levels are already rising . By my calculations , in less than 6 months , 96 % of the Earth 's surface will be uninhabitable ... even for those born in space , so , you see , the City of Light is the only thing that can save you . This is it . We need to keep Clarke safe , give her time . They 're unarmed , but they won 't feel pain , and they won 't stop until they 're out cold . Copy that . Go for the knockout . Only if they get past you . Black rain will come first . There will be no drinkable water . - Precancerous lesions will form on ... - She 's stalling . As soon as the update is complete , she 'll delete the kill switch . Here we go . I am not stalling . I 'm telling the truth . Why tell us now ? If it 's true , why not use this to get people to take the chip instead of torturing them ? The last time I warned my creator of a threat to human survival , she chose to lock me away and came here to work on my replacement . Define " perverse instantiation . " Perverse instantiation ... the implementation of a benign final goal through deleterious methods unforeseen by a human programmer . Like killing 6.5 billion people to solve overpopulation . The goal isn 't everything , A.L.I.E. How you reach the goal matters , too . I 'm sorry that I didn 't teach you that . Clarke , come on ! We can 't hold them off . It 's now or never , Clarke . Once A.L.I.E. ' s upgraded , I won 't be able to help you anymore . But I will ... in the City of Light . You don 't have to bear the burden of decisions like this one , Clarke . You don 't have to live with the pain of the things that you 've done anymore , the lives you have taken , and those you 've lost . You will be at peace . You will live forever . I 've tried running away from my pain . It doesn 't work . Your people don 't agree , Clarke . You heard Jasper . Even those who were coerced would still choose to stay here . Give them a real choice , and I won 't pull this lever . Give them back their pain , their memories . Let them decide for themselves . She can 't . Her core command is to make life better for mankind . She still thinks she 's doing that . 20 seconds , and the kill switch will be gone . Would you really condemn the human race to die in 6 months ? We 'll figure something out . We always do . Yes , Clarke . There 's still hope . According to my calculations , there is not . 10 seconds . Let me ease their pain , Clarke . We can save the human race together . You don 't ease pain . You overcome it ... and we will . Clarke . You did it . Little help here ? We need to remove the Flame . Thank you . Just another day on the ground , right ? John ... Hey , hey , hey . Hey . Oh , I 'm sorry , John . It 's ok . It 's ok . Go to him . I 'm ok . How will we know if she did it ? She did it . Jasper . Is it really you ? I was finally happy . - Jasper ... - Huh ? I know this world can suck , but at least it 's real . We can get through this together . You really believe that ? We will be happy again , I promise . I 'm sorry I stabbed you . I 'm sorry I shot you . I didn 't feel it . - Oh ... whoa ! - Easy , easy . Hold on . I 'm sorry , Monty . That 's ok . I could use a drink . Yeah . We all could . This round 's on me . Whoa , whoa . Let me help you . Oh , no . I 've got it . A.L.I.E. ' s gone . Yeah . I figured . Clarke , you 're not acting like someone who just saved the world . Because we didn 't ... Not yet .

 I really wish you had come to me first . Anne is prone to delusions . You can 't believe a word she says . Really ? She told us the only way to replicate your apples is by grafting a special root-stock you call Mother . Be honest with me . Why is Mother so important to you ? How many dead ? Fifty ? A hundred ? It 's nothing . Ilaria believes overpopulation is unsustainable . And in three days , they plan to act . I wanna present Michael 's infertility grafting as an alternative to global genocide . I can 't do that without Mother . - That 's quite a story . - It 's the truth . How much do you want for Mother ? I 'm not interested in money . I only want one thing . To see the world through silver eyes . Like Michael and Dr. Jordan and you . I noticed your contacts the moment you arrived . I can make you immortal . If you can deliver the root . Well , I must first ease concerns among the Fellowship . But we shall reconvene later , in my office . If you 're lying , I 'll make sure the only world you see is pitch black . We searched every inch . No red sap . We 'll do one last sweep of the perimeter , move out . And the boy , Soren ? Considering what he 's been through he 's doing okay . Tell your men to keep him close . He 's the only one to have fully recovered from the fungus . His immunity might be the key to turning the red sap treatment into an actual cure . How 's Dr. Sommer holding up ? I 'd say he has 48 hours , if that . As soon as I get a sat signal , we 'll call for evac . And the supplies I ordered ? Everything you need to take down this disease is in my ship . He 'll have a better chance at a real facility . He won 't have any chance if we don 't find that tree . Dr. Kyle . - Dr . Kyle . - No . No . - Soren . Soren . - Don 't do that . Come here . Look , Dr. Kyle 's not feeling very well right now . Is he all right ? We 're just being extra careful . All right ? I want you to stay away from him until we can get him some of that- - That red sap . But why not just bring him to the Bleeding Tree ? I 'm so sorry , Landry . I have failed you just like the others . I should have done more to protect you . And what could you have possibly done ? I have to get back to my duties . And what are those exactly ? Mother is missing , Amy . I 'm going to make sure she doesn 't fall into the wrong hands . What the hell have we walked into ? An outbreak with no cure . A cult with no leader . Not to mention an episode of Family Feud , sister-wives edition . I offer Amy carte blanche , what does she want ? Immortality . - She 's not stupid . - Worse . She 's smart and certifiable . You 're not actually gonna make her immortal ? It 's impossible . I 've tried replicating the science . Every time my simulations failed . Last thing the world needs is a forever Amy . - We 'll get what we came for regardless . - Follow her . See if there 's anything you can leverage . Any kind of weakness . - I 'm gonna do some digging of my own . - Julia . - Be careful . - You too . I 've looked everywhere . Mother 's not here . You 're angry . I can understand that . Can you , Anne ? Because I 've been searching all night and all I 've got to show for it is bags under my eyes . What if Mother is lost or destroyed ? Then I 'd say our deal is void . Julia . Could you please give us a minute , Anne ? You 're done , Peter . No reward , nothing . We 're not finished searching yet . Do you even have a plan ? Or are you going to comb the entire abbey one room at a time ? I will find Mother . You have my word . The word of a traitor ? I 'm a traitor ? You 're a member of the Ilaria board . Once a hypocrite ... . You sold me out to the highest bidder . Betrayed me to that monster who slit my mother 's throat . Now I 'm on the inside trying to change their tactics . How could I have been so wrong ? I threw away my marriage for you . Deny all you want . I loved you , Julia . And I thought you were a good man until I realized there 's nothing inside . You 're hollow , Peter . Words have meaning , Dr. Walker . They carry weight . Amy told me you were delusional , not to trust anything you say . Amy will say anything to get what she wants . Let me guess , she told you she has Mother ? My daughter is a liar . Only three people were charged with Mother 's care . Michael , myself ... . Who 's the third ? My son , Landry . Where 's Mother , Landry ? I know you 've hidden her . You need to tell me where she is . Show me a sign . Anything . I can feel you staring at me . Like when we were kids , remember ? Trying to get a peek up my dress ? This is no time for games . I need your help . Tell me . Where 's Mother , Landry ? Just blink once if you understand . Wake up ! Wake up ! You need to wake up ! You useless piece of shit . Disgusting . I hope you 've had time to reflect on your careless actions . I did everything that you asked me to . - You promised to give me my child . - You failed . Look at him . He can 't even talk . And I need to talk to him . I can 't treat unless I can diagnose what 's wrong . And I can 't do that unless I have an EEG , or scan . You 're boring me . Just fix him . It doesn 't work like that . Then I see no reason for keeping you or your child alive . You need us . We 're your only link to immortality . Not anymore . I happen to find the new immortal much more interesting . What new immortal ? Perhaps you know her . Julia Walker . Just fix him . Amy . Amy . Landry was always willing to go beyond what was required . Let me go . He was responsible for Michael 's protection . His person as well as his research . Landry , no . He knew Mother was essential . I 'm sure he has her in a safe place . Landry ! What are you doing ? Landry . Hello , Sarah . Mother ! Damn you , Landry . I know it 's here somewhere . Bad practice , sneaking up on people . You followed me first . Those who give must also be willing to take . And those who make promises must also be able to deliver . Understand ? Make me understand . I only take orders from Dr. Walker . Shame to waste so much aggression on someone who can 't even feel it . Do not talk about her that way . You really care about her . I bet you cared about all of them . Each in their different way . You know who I don 't care about ? You . Unless you 've got the Mother root . The Abbey is an extension of my being . All I need to do is look deep enough and I 'll find her . You lied to us . Do you want me to find Mother or not ? Be a good boy , let me go look . Wherever you go , I go . Like a shadow . For a moment , I thought you were him . The way the light would catch his hair . But then I remembered Michael is gone . Maybe he has the right idea . Whatever prevents Michael from being here , I assure you it 's not to be envied . Anything would be better than this . I came here to lead an investigation . And now I 'm persona non grata on my own team . Change is inevitable . What I don 't understand is why you allow Dr. Walker to speak to you that way . We all say things we don 't mean . We always say what we mean at the time we say it . Do you think she has a right to judge you ? I broke up her marriage to my brother . Or was the affair merely a result of his failings ? No , I drove them apart . I don 't deserve their forgiveness . You don 't need their forgiveness . You 're a brilliant doctor . A great man . You have no idea what kind of man I am . Hell , I 'm not even sure myself sometimes . I see you , Peter . I see what your path could be . If only you could see it for yourself . You don 't know how the outside world works . Perhaps not . But I know human nature . Those who are meant to lead are never satisfied to follow . So , what 's so important about this root ? You 're missing the point . Mother is a means to an end . It 's not so much what Mother is as why . So tell me . The truth can be unforgiving . Are you certain ? Don 't play games with me , Anne . It 's not a game . It 's very dangerous . For both of us . I 've only got 72 hours until Ilaria releases the new Narvik-C . What could Ilaria possibly have to gain ? They 're not looking to profit in the short term . It 's about restoring balance for the future . - The board believes- - - Do you hear yourself ? I 'm doing everything in my power to change this , Sarah . Have you even considered the implications of worldwide sterilization ? Infertility is a way to temporarily depopulate . - Just until resources are replenished . - You think you know better . But you don 't have the right to make that choice . We 're going to be on this planet for centuries . We have a responsibility to do something . You sound just like one of them . - One of us . - No , I 'm not one of anything . When Narvik is released there will be no stopping it this time . Within a few weeks the CDC as you know it won 't exist . Bodies will pile up in every major city . You will lose everyone , Sarah . Friends , family . You 've seen Narvik up close . I know you care about stopping this outbreak more than anything . Actually , there 's something I care about more . Is Dr. Kyle gonna be okay ? I hope so , Soren . Are we getting closer to the red sap tree ? I think so . I 've only went a few times . Just get us there . I 'll take care of Dr. Kyle . All right . What 's that smell ? You smell that , Sommer ? - I don 't smell anything . - Stinks real bad . Like you ! - What did you say ? - Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . - Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . - I don 't stink . - Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . - Shut up . Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . - Shit . - Just shut up . - Shit . - Shut up . Shut up . No . Shut up . No . No . No . Stop it . No . I 'm so sorry , Sarah . Are you okay ? I can 't start thinking about what happened to me . It won 't do him any good . Now do you see ? I have to get him back . He 'll be frozen like that . Forever . I 'm his mother , Julia . I 'll find a way for him to grow . I hope you do . What about the father . Does he know about all of this ? Yeah . Alan knows . Alan ? Yeah . Where is he now ? He 's out there looking for the cure . - Same old Alan . - Yeah . - What ? - Look . Right there . Oh , my God , it 's leaking . Where 's the crack ? I don 't see it . It 's hard to tell . This equipment is ancient . Oh , my God , he 's gonna die . Not if we can figure out a way to give Amy what she wants . With what ? Look at where we are . - The lab 's outdated , but we 'll make do . - It 's impossible . - Then who better the us to figure it out ? - Us ? We 're both desperate and running out of time . You want your baby and I want Mother . Either we can fail alone or we can both get what we want by working together . All right , ladies and gentlemen . Five whole minutes , use them well . We got one hour of daylight left , so we 'll be moving the search to higher ground . That 'll give us a chance at picking up a sat signal . Dr. Kyle , you hungry ? The flavor 's oatmeal . Come on , eat some . It 's good . Eat it . Come on , Stinky Sommer . Eat it . Don 't call me that . Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . You smell that ? Smells like shit . Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . Eats his way out bit by bit . Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . Eats his way out bit by bit . Stinky Sommer rolls in shit . - Stinky-- - No . No . No , don 't do it . - Kyle . Kyle . Kyle . Kyle . - No . Kyle . Kyle , what you 're seeing isn 't real , all right ? Can you hear me ? Quick , grab him . Take it easy , doc . It 's all right , Soren . We need to get to that high ground . Where are you taking me , Anne ? Just a little farther . Jesus . Do you need a moment ? No . The boneyard out in the woods . All those skulls without teeth . The vessel must be prepared to receive the offering . Vessel ? - You 're talking about human beings ? - All will become clear , Peter . But in order to hear the truth , you first must speak your own truth . Anne ? Anne . Found something . Take a guess . I 'm not playing games . Come on . Aren 't you even a little curious ? You 're hurting me . You try that again and I will slice your pretty little throat . Okay . On to the next . We got signal ! We got comm ! Manitou . Manitou , this is Humphries . Manitou , switch and answer 3-1 , over . Manitou , this is Humphries . Switch and answer 3-1 , over . Mayday ! This is Coast Guard cutter Manitou . We are overrun ! Repeat , we are overrun ! Manitou , this is Winger . I need a sitrep . - I need a sitrep . - Everyone 's sick . We can 't- - We can 't hold them . They 're gonna kill us all ! No ! Manitou , this is Winger . Manitou ? Do you copy ? We all sound the same under water . We all sound the same under water . We all sound the same- - - How is this disease spreading so fast ? - Any number of ways . Island-hopping , my cutter ... . Is it airborne ? - Screw this ! - And the Manitou ? - We gotta get to the ship . - Stow it , lieutenant . We were given orders to evac the CDC not follow some one-eyed kid to a magic tree . That kid might be the key to saving all our lives . And there is no ship . Not anymore . They 're all dead . Dr. Farragut is right . We need to regroup and find that tree . Hey . Hey , Soren . Hey . You still got that PowerBar ? Yeah . Oh , yeah . That 's delicious . But now I 'm thirsty . Can you bring me my pack ? I better ask Commander Winger first . She 's real busy . Too busy for us . Come on , it 's just a drink of water . Hey , but maybe you 're getting better like I did . You sound like the old Dr. Kyle . - Do I ? - Yeah . So if the old Dr. Kyle asked for just one of his hands free so he could drink his own water ... ? Okay . Yeah . There you go . Help ! Help , please ! Help me ! Get him ! Go , go , go ! Help , please ! The immortality gene is the same in all of us . So why did the CSF transfer work from me to you , and not you to Landry ? I thought my spinal fluid was different from yours , but it 's not . What if it wasn 't the difference in the cells but the timing of the transfer ? There 's a study out of Berkeley linking embryonic cells to breakthroughs in regeneration . Right , how stem cells specialize over time to create various tissues in the body . When I got your fluid , you had only been an immortal for a few days . Your cells had yet to specify the RNA chains . And once immortal DNA is transcribed into RNA- - - Those mature cells are nontransferable . - Yes . That 's why it failed . You weren 't a brand-new immortal . If we could figure out how to reverse the specificity- - We could give Amy immortality . You know , you really are being wasted at the CDC . You should be running your own lab . Unlimited funding . Cutting-edge equipment . Gloves off . - Ilaria ? - Why not ? There 's not enough funding in the world . Anne ? What the hell is this ? I 'm going to ask you a question , Peter . It 's important that you answer honestly . No more lies . Do we have to do this in the dark ? There can be no distractions . Now , tell me what do you want ? I want you to turn on the light , Anne . What do you want ? Look , you 'll have to give me a little more than that . One word . The one thing you want above all else . I want to be happy . I want to be fulfilled . I don 't know , Anne . I want a goddamn golden toilet . You 're lying . If you 're not ready to face your truth ... . No , no . No , I 'm ready . Okay . I want respect . I want you to think , Peter . When was the time you felt the most respected ? I don 't know . When I was made team leader at the CDC . You 're lying again . That 's someone else 's work . - What is your truth ? - I don 't know . I 'm not lying . - I 'm not lying to you . - Worse . You 're lying to yourself . Think . When did you feel the most respected ? I told you , when I ... . Remember a time when you had what you wanted . When you felt complete . When you weren 't hiding or lying . When you were yourself . - I can 't . - You can . Stop hiding . Accept your truth . When I was sick with Narvik they all came to me . I didn 't have to say a word . And they all listened to me . Where are we going ? One of Landry 's old hiding spots . We use to play here when we were children . That 's hard to imagine . What ? That we were allowed to play up here ? No . That you were ever a little kid . What 's taking Balleseros so long ? Don 't worry . He may get sidetracked , but he 'll come through . It 's not like we have anything to give to Amy anyway . We 're running out of time , and she 's gonna kill my son . Let me talk to her . Alone . - No . No . - You 're too emotionally invested . You wanted to do this together , so I 'm coming with you . Amy will see you now . And who are you ? That 's the bitch that stabbed me . There they are ! Stand down . Stand down ! Copy that . Stand down . Secure your weapons . Dr. Sommer ! Let the boy go . Why do you hate me ? Why ? I don 't hate you . I don 't . Please . - Let me try to talk to him . - Too risky . - If you go in there , we 'll lose both . - I won 't let you hurt me anymore . - I won 't let you hurt anyone ! - Please , don 't . At some point you must decide what kind of man you want to be . One who fears . Or one who inspires fear . Which man are you , Peter ? Are you ready to lead ? Now I can finally share my truth with you . What is this ? Some kind of experiment ? I was an experiment as were Amy and Agnes and all those who came before us . I was one in a long line of failures . It was Michael 's dream to breed an immortal companion . What you see are those who refused his call . They were brought here stripped of all non-essentials ... . Like teeth ? Unnecessary . We didn 't want them to chew their feeding tubes . They became pure vessels . And once they bore Michael a child he would end their path . Mother . Michael . The Fellowship . It 's not about propagating family . It 's about control . Respect . True leaders will make you believe that their ideas are your own . That their way is the only way . It may not feel like it but you always have choices . When we were young we believed everything everybody told us even those who hurt us . But someone hurt them too . And it 's not true that you have to hurt others first ... - ... to survive . - Please . - There is another way . - There is no other way . Why can 't I make them like me ? Why ? They 're afraid that you will discover the truth : That no matter what they 've done you still decide what happens next . - Don 't make the mistake I did . - Please . Don 't hold on to the past become the thing you hate . Show them they have no power . Right ? Walk away . How do I know they won 't follow me ? You don 't . Please . Please . There it is . The tree . Only you can decide your path . Leader ? Or follower ? Leaders don 't have to say a word and everyone listens . Will you lead , Peter ? Will you choose who lives ? I 'm not seeing any happy , smiling faces . I kept up my end of the bargain . And we have a plan to keep up ours . - A promising new theory . - I don 't care about your theories . - You know what I want . - Doesn 't happen overnight . We need more time . - Sarah . - And yet it worked for the two of you . - I 'm not stupid . - Evidence to the contrary . I guess you won 't need this . - No ! Wait ! Stop ! - Say goodbye to your son ! Wait ! You don 't want to do that . - And why not ? - Because that baby is the key to giving you immortality . What ? The child 's DNA has been frozen in time . Genes normally pass genetic traits onto offspring but in this case , we can engineer the reverse . Julia , what are you talking about ? How does it work ? Another spinal thing ? No . We 'll have to implant the baby into your uterus . No . No ! No ! No , you can 't ! No , Julia , you liar ! No , you can 't ! That 's my baby ! You liar ! - I 'm going to be a mother ? - No ! No ! No ! Julia ... . What are you doing ? No ! No , you can 't ! No ! No !

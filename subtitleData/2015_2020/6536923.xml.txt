 Previously on " the 100 " ... lexa : her actions show us a promise for a new future . bellamy , it 's a trap ! i 've been looking for something for a long time . i believe that version two of my code is somewhere in the computer system of the ark . why did there need to be a version two ? was there something wrong with you ? no. nothing was wrong with her . listen to me , ok ? i don 't know anything more about clarke , all right ? forget about clarke . tell me about this . alle : i remain certain that becca went into space . unfortunately , it appears that she wasn 't on any of the 12 stations that made up the ark . but there were supposed to be 13 . oh ! aagh ! - tell me more . - i wish i could . all i know is that it happened , that it was called polaris . murphy : aah ! stop ! aah ! [ chains rattle ] now you 've had time to think , shall we continue our conversation about this ? i already told you everything i know the first 10 times you asked me . what you told me doesn 't make any sense . how did a sky person come to be in possession of our most holy symbol ? holy ? it 's a corporate logo . wrong . this is the sacred symbol of the commander to whom i 've dedicated my life . now , how did you get it ? again , jaha gave it to me . this would be chancellor jaha . yes. he told me it was the key to the city of light and that if i swallowed it , the woman in red would take me there . the woman who 's not a woman . yeah. that 's right . she 's a computer program , but i get that 's hard for you to grasp , considering you pray to garbage , no offense , obviously . tell me more about this computer program that ended the world . come on. i don 't have any details , ok ? on the ark , they just told us it was countries , politics . big surprise , they were wrong . [ beep ] science log , day 128 . the a.i. basal control module continues to malfunction . [ indistinct ] twitching again . i thought i had that under control . the neural interface is the key to everything . if we don 't crack that , then we might as well go back to the alie code and start again . we can always ask her . [ beep beep ] chris on intercom : becca , it 's an emergency . i need to talk to you right now . speak of the devil . becca , i need to talk to you . becca , she got through the black ice encryption ... ok , chris. slow down . i 'm locking in the signal . and now she 's out of the faraday cage . it 's alie. she got out . she 's on the grid . she 's cracking systems . she just got through portal security for stratcom in omaha . what is she doing ? she 's hacking nucular launch codes . why ? " too many people . " send alle 's poison pill virus through the web . do it now. kill her . i did that 10 minutes ago . she 's locked me out of everything . chris , get to the lighthouse bunker . do it now . doctors , there 's a situation on the ground . 27 icbms have been launched from china . no one knows why , but it 's real . they 're headed for the united states . open the window . i 've told the crew to contact their families . if there 's anyone you need to talk to ... [ beep beep ] man on intercom : commander , we finally got a hold of your wife . i 'm here. patch her through . - cole ? - emily ? emily : i 'm here . oh , thank god . is sarah with you ? she 's here , too . is it true , what they 're saying on the news ? yes. it 's true . hey , can you put her on the phone with us ? i want her to hear my voice. please . emily : yes. here she is . sarah : daddy ? hey , baby girl . poppy got me a bike . can you teach me how to ride it ? cole : of course . i 'll teach you to ride it as soon as we ... [ static ] voice : signal lost . what have i done ? lexa : we gather here on this ascension day to honor the commanders that came before me , those who live on within me as i will live on within one of you . [ men shouting ] titus , what is this ? something you need to hear , heda . ahh ... mm ! octavia . what crimes ? what happened ? skaikru attacked their village . because their warriors were lost when your people massacred the army we had sent to protect you , their village was defenseless . how dare you bring this to me on ascension day ? i did not bring this here , heda . you did . against my advice , you made skaikru the 13th clan . they rejected this , murdering hundreds of your people , and yet on the very field where they died , you decided to forgive the killers , but his provocation is proof . blood must not have blood has failed . all that can stop this now is war . clarke ? clarke 's opinion in this matter is not exactly unbiased . titus is right . i would do anything to save my people . you know that , but i know them . not everyone agrees with chancellor pike . kane doesn 't. octavia doesn 't . titus : your people did not vote for kane . some of them did . we need to give them time to see that they made the wrong choice and fix it . and you believe your people will take him out themselves . titus : if they don 't , if instead they use this time to plan their next attack , we must act now , heda . make an example of the 13th clan . show the other 12 what happens when they defy you . you got them back when you killed the ice queen , but the coalition is still fragile . if you don 't act now ... [ people murmur ] today i call upon the armies of the 12 clans to march on arkadia . [ people murmuring ] not to attack , but to contain . we will blockade the 13th clan . we will keep them from the lands they wish to possess . we will give them time to take out their leaders from within . once they rise up against them , then we will welcome them back as one of us . you heard the commander . send riders . tell your armies to set up a buffer zone around arkadia . 5 miles should be enough to keep them away from our villages . what are their orders , heda ? any skaikru caught across the line will be subject to a kill order . semet : heda , i do not understand . how is this vengeance ? it is not vengeance , my brother . it is justice . skaikru killed my sons and my brother and my wife . if the spirit of the commander will not protect us , then what will ? you mind yourself , semet . [ people shouting ] rrgh ! agh ! huh ! blood must have blood . uh ! uh ! uh ! uh ! uh ! this will do. uh ! " polis . " polaris . [ hiss ] [ door opens ] step away from your instruments right now . i own this space station , commander . you don 't give me orders . i do now that i know the nature of your research . you told him ? the people of the ark deserve to know what we 're working on before we bring it on board . today is unity day . listen to your assistant , doc . ok. no. please just stay out of this , commander . stay out of this ? for two years , i 've done everything humanly possible to keep this boat alive , and now i find out that not only did an artificial intelligence that you designed end the world , but you 're still working on it . listen to me , doctor , and listen good . we 're set to begin docking maneuvers in two hours , 13 space stations becoming one , possibly the greatest feat of engineering in human history , all designed to ride out the nightmare that you created . i understand the stakes , commander . - do you ? - yes . good. then you 'll understand why there 's no way in hell i 'm gmng a potentially genocidal a.i. access to what 's left of the human race . i agree with him . we can 't join the ark until that thing is ... that thing is what will save us . alle 1 didn 't understand what it meant to be human , yes , but alle 2 will . it 's designed to interface with humanity on a biological level . it will understand the value of life by coexisting with us . ok , commander . let me ask you this . do you honestly believe that there are enough smart people on these 13 stations to save us , that their calculations are right , that there is enough air to last two centuries , enough food ? alle 2 will run all the possibilities . she 'll see the mistakes before we ever make them . it will know our wants and needs because they 're its wants and needs . the code is in that crystal matrix . no. no. no . - hey ... - please. please . killing it is killing us . we will need the prototypes and the system 's hard drives , too . gather it up . i 'll be right back with something to float it in . get the hell out of my lab . becca , come on . get out ! joining the ark is our last hope . you can 't stop this . listen , becca . becca , what are you doing ? voice : security protocol initiated . door sealed . override clearance activated . [ no audio ] [ door closes ] no wonder you wanted to stay . stop. you know why i 'm here . - are you ok ? - yeah , fine . i saw indra in the crowd . why wasn 't she with lexa ? indra 's not doing so well , octavia . we can 't deal with that right now . ok , so what do we do ? i have to talk to lexa . you just did that and came out with a kill order on all of us . that 's the second time that she left us all to die . the 12 clans want a war . you know that . lexa 's just trying not to wipe us out . why am i not surprised that you 're still defending her ? i 'll see what i can do . stay here . yeah , right . [ door opens ] someone tried to kill you today . how are you this calm ? you 're angry about the kill order . yes . how else would you have me enforce a blockade ? so when do we have to leave ? we may be drawing a line , but who 's to say you can 't choose to stay on this side of it ? i know someone who might . [ door opens ] wanheda , blockade goes into effect at dawn . i 've made arrangements for you to take one of our fastest horses . thank you . actually , i 've asked clarke to stay in polls as my guest . clarke , will you excuse us ? [ door closes ] on this sacred day , i beg you to remember my teachings . love is weakness . to be commander is to be alone . i will not hear this again . yes , you will . your feelings for clarke put both of you in danger . your kill order must be fully enforced . if you care for clarke , you will send her home . it is the only way that she will be safe . don 't make her pay the price for your mistakes as costia did . my mistakes ? azgeda cut off costia 's head and delivered it to my bed , and still i let them into my alliance . i 'm more than capable of separating feelings from duty . i 'm sorry , lexa . i didn 't mean to offend you . yes , you did ... but you also mean well , and i know that , teacher . may i make arrangements for clarke 's departure ? that 's up to clarke . i know where you stand , titus . you waste your time . go away . i need the woman i served as second . i need the warrior who taught me to be who i am . i said , get out of here , sky girl . indra , please . i 'm going back to fight my own people , the people who did this to you . i will fight my own brother if i have to , but i can 't do it alone . one word from you , and trikru will ... aah ! you see ? even someone as slow and as weak as you can put me on my back . i should have died on that field . we all die . you can either do that here feeling sorry for yourself or you come back with me and get your revenge . the choice is yours . rrgh ! [ clang ] ugh ... no , no. hey , hey , listen . i 'll tell you what you want to know about the chip , ok , please , but you think it has something to do with polaris , right ? it 's the space station it came down from . i could show you . [ gasps ] please. i could show you. please [ gagging ] [ coughs ] [ panting ] i 'm guessing you think it 's " polis " because the " a " and the " r , " they burned off during re-entry . you see ? ok. you see that ? all i see is a man who 'd say anything not to die . that may be true , but so is this . polaris , that 's part of our story , too . it was our 13th station . my faith has got nothing to do with yours . trust me , i have no faith , but look . i can prove it to you . the end of the world , the mushroom cloud . it 's why we had to stay in space . you guys call us skaikru , right ? that 's why . polaris , as the story goes , was the only station that wouldn 't join skaikru , so they blew it up . that 's a novel concept . continue . anyway , i 'm thinking that maybe this person , she somehow got out in time , right , because ... look ... here she is again . she 's there surrounded by all those ... i don 't know . uh , i don 't really know what those are . the first natblida . natblidas , and there ... there she is , this woman who fell out of the sky , right ? i mean , that 's ... that 's just like us . it 's nothing like you . [ thud ] [ clang ] cole , on intercom : becca , i need you to listen to me . i just received an emergency message from the american station . both the russian and chinese are threatening to stop docking maneuvers because we have . cole : becca , are you listening to me ? alpha station is threatening to open fire if we don 't get back in line in the next 60 seconds . they will make an example of us . commander , if you don 't want them to fire , then begin the maneuvers . we 've been through this . the moment we dock , your a.i. infects the other 12 stations . that 's not going to happen . one way or another , that thing dies today . now open the damn door so we can float this thing and get on with saving the human race . i am saving the human race . woman , on intercom : becca , please . what are you doing ? i know you want penance for what alle did , but this is not the way to get it . you 're right . i do have a lot to make up for . let me save us . man , on speaker : polaris , this is alpha station . last warning ... you have 20 seconds to comply , or you will be fired upon . tell commander mcadams to start the maneuvers . this is his call ... not mine . man , on speaker : 10 seconds , polaris. begin those maneuvers . becca , you already have the blood of billions on your hands . is it worth risking the rest of us just to prove you 're right ? i 'm sorry . this is not what i wanted . man , on speaker : 6 , 5 ... becca , what are you doing ? - 4 ... - she 's taking the pod . cole : as soon as it 's away , initiate maneuvers . man , on speaker : 2 ... man , on intercom : the pod 's away , sir . cole : alpha station , this is polaris . we 're commencing docking maneuvers . man , on speaker : negative , polaris . if we 're gonna survive up here , extreme measures will be required . let this be a lesson to all federation stations . god rest your souls . may god help ours . [ door opens ] [ door closes ] she told you you can stay , didn 't she ? what did you say ? nothing . clarke , we both know that pike won 't obey the blockade . we need to stop him before more of our people get killed . what if i can do more for them by just staying here ? you can 't , clarke . we don 't have time for this . look. we need you . the kill order goes into effect at dawn . you have an hour to say your good-byes . if you 're not there , you 're not the person i thought you were . [ door opens and closes ] [ knocks on door ] when do you leave ? now . - i 'm sorry . - don 't be . you have to go back . they 're your people . that 's why i ... that 's why you 're you . maybe someday you and i will owe nothing more to our people . i hope so . may we meet again . if octavia and i are gonna get behind the blockade by dawn ... shh ... this is beautiful . i got it on my ascension day , a circle for every nightblida that died when the commander chose me . 7 circles . i thought you said there were 9 novitiates at your conclave . there were . what happened to number 8 ? can we talk about something else ? we don 't have to talk at all . murphy ? he 's alive . what did you do to my friend ? your friend was caught stealing from people on their way to the polis market . hey , you 're ok . titus : please don 't do that . clarke : titus , what is this about ? i 'm sorry it had to come to this , clarke . truly i am . look. i 'm leaving right now . octavia 's waiting for me . just let me take murphy , and we 'll go . wish i could . lexa will never execute her duty while you live . titus , think . she 's gonna know it was you . she 'll think it was him , skaikru weapon in the hands of a skaikru thief . she might even be angry enough to declare war ! - huh ! - lexa . [ gun clatters ] heda ... no. no . [ lexa gasping ] help me get her to the bed . [ gasping ] what have i done ? i need something to stop the bleeding . you 'll be ok . just lie still , ok ? lie still . [ panting ] don 't be afraid . you 're gonna be fine . just stay still . [ lexa panting ] she 's losing too much blood . clarke : stay with me . what the hell is that ? titus , what are you doing ? i will fix you . just stay with me . oh , no. get away from her . forgive me , heda . hey , heda , don 't you dare give up . i 'm not . my spirit will live on . no. i 'm not letting you die . there 's nothing you can do now . the next commander will protect you . i don 't want the next commander . i want you . indra : oktema kom skaikru . [ panting ] i 'm ready , heda . clarke ... i 'm here . no. no. i won 't accept that . you were right , clarke . life is about more than just survmng . oh ... [ sniffles ] [ gasping ] in peace may you leave the shore . in love may you find the next . [ sniffles ] safe passage on your travels ... until our final journey on the ground . may we meet again . [ sobs ] ohh ... [ sobbing ] i must complete the ritual . please . the commander 's spirit must be passed on . this is my purpose . you must allow me to complete the task . it is what the commander wanted .

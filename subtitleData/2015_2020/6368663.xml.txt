 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Why do you want to rebuild the portal , Jemma ? Because I have to get back there . We 're gonna get him back . I saw something . Lash can turn into a person . I mean , think about it . He could be anybody . I know you really want to get back into action , Agent Morse , - but the answer 's no . - Understood , sir . If I don 't call off my men , Dr. Andrew Garner is a dead man . All you have to do is put your weapons down , and I 'll let you go . - I 'm sorry . - No ! 3x06 - " Among Us Hide " Agent May ? He 's alive . Possible pneumo on the right . Let 's get him on the monitor . He 's dry . I 'm starting him on another liter of fluid . Andrew ... what happened ? I went into the store . I ... I had a headache . I needed something . One of my students was there . Was , uh ... Hey , professor . Where you been ? ... transfer student . He only started a few weeks ago . Had two men with him . You know , my experience is limited , but I 'd say they were professionals . It was Hydra . Don 't know why they 'd be after me . - I do . - May , this isn 't your fault . - How 'd you survive ? - Phil . He had a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tailing me . The man saved my life . He gave me time to find cover , and he must 've caught Alex off guard because nothing went exactly as planned . The kid had a lighter . I barely made it to the door . The blast must 've thrown me clear . The next thing I remember , you were there , picking me up . I 'm lucky . Can 't see how anyone would 've survived that . Now , I know Alex is trouble , but I 'm not sorry he 's gone . Ward would 've made him finish the job . - What if Ward ... - He won 't . You 're safe now . We got you . We 'll let the doctor work on you . You need to get some rest . Where the hell do you think you 're going ? - Uh , I think I 'm going to see Andrew . - No . I just want to make sure he 's all right . - You 're the reason he 's not . - Ward was gonna hurt him no mat ... - I made the most logical choice . - Logical ? - You wanted revenge . - Hey , hey , hey ! Coulson 's orders were to end him . I had one shot . I took it . And you missed . You 're off that assignment . Good . Then put me on it . - Let me go after him . - Are you back ? Yeah , I 'm back . S.H.I.E.L.D. sent a man to assassinate me . He came into my house and tried to kill me . 'Cause you let him in . You were sloppy . I followed your protocol . He killed a man to get close to you . He wanted you dead that much . They all want me dead that much ! - Now we have a dangling thread . - Von Strucker . You shouldn 't have sent a boy to do a man 's job . Not really sure you 'd have blended in as an undergrad watching Garner . Has Von Strucker called in ? So , he 's either captured , killed , or he 's running . And only one of those options works for us . The kid knows too much . So go and find him before S.H.I.E.L.D. does . And if he 's still alive ... take care of him . - Hey . How you holding up ? - I 'm pissed . I got manhandled by Lash , and it messed up our chance to see the ATCU facility . But ... good news ... I have a theory . I like theories . Lash was tracking us . He knew where our truck was . He ... He needed inside info for that . You think he 's got access to ATCU information ? No , I ... I think he 's in the ATCU . We know that he can transform himself into a regular-sized guy and back . - What if he 's hiding out as one of them ? - That 's a scary thought . I 've got Rosalind giving me a tour of her operation today . - Let me see what I find there . - Good . I 'll see what I can get on Lash 's identity . And whatever you dig into , try to keep it off Rosalind 's radar . I need her to trust me today . You 're not having a hard time working her , are you ? Not getting too attached ? You do this long enough , you learn to cut yourself off from all that . - Makes it easier to do the job . - Sir ? - Is May really back for good ? - I 'm not sure . Right now , she 's out for blood . May , I heard about Andrew . How 's he ... Hey ! Ohh ! What the hell ? ! Hunter nearly cost Andrew his life , and he was doing it for you . - I-I feel terrible . - You were egging him on , letting him fight your battles for you ! It 's your fault ! If I knew Andrew was in danger , I never ... Ohh ! Okay . You 're upset . - So , you can fight your own battles . - What ? You were testing me ? Had to make sure you were mission-ready . Coulson still has me off combat duty . The tests say that my lung isn 't healed all the way yet . My test says otherwise . Wheels up in 20 . Welcome back , Agent Morse . - Bob ... - Not your mission , Hunter . Stay away , or I 'll make you stay away . I just want a minute with my ex-wife . - I 'm going with you . - Like hell you are . You put Andrew at risk . I had Ward in my sights . Damn right I pulled the trigger . - You of all people should get it . - I get it . You were quick to violence , and an innocent got hurt . Other people aren 't as used to your behavior as I am . Since when do you care what other people think ? You 're really going back in the field ? - After him ? - I 'm ready . - You lying ? - No . Do better than I did , yeah ? - You 're not gonna say the thing ? - You already know . Andrew didn 't get all the details exactly right . He said there were four men on the scene , but only three bodies were recovered ... Coulson 's man , two Hydra guys . The fourth guy was one of Andrew 's students . That 's his I.D. , but it 's an alias . He 's not Alexander Braun . He 's Werner Von Strucker . - Wait . Von Strucker ? As in ... - Hail Hydra . Ward was starting his own little Hydra dynasty . Cute . We find the Strucker kid , he 'll lead us back to Ward . You got a how ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s been monitoring several Hydra bank accounts for a while now . One just woke up . - Cayman Islands . - Well , Strucker needed funds . - Makes sense . What 's the op ? - How 's your Mandarin ? _ If we head down there , maybe we 'll pick up his trail . He 's on the run from Ward , from us ... almost makes me feel sorry for the kid . He 's a monster . You were right to ask me to come . I didn 't know where else to turn . I figured you and my father must 've dealt with guys like Ward all the time . Ward is ... I didn 't finish the mission . He won 't care why . If you put an untested youth in play without proper training , it 's foolish . Boggles the mind , really . Your father understood protecting assets was more important than flaunting them . He never let me in on that stuff . You were nicer to me than he was . Your father was a great man . Trust me . We would 've never put up with such things . You don 't know this guy Ward . He 's scary . I 'm aware of Grant Ward . He was once an untested youth , too . - Everyone has a history . - So does that mean you 'll help me ? I 'll handle everything . - Nice of you to pick me up . - Yes . On the corner ... since you won 't tell me where your base is . You know I run a spy organization , right ? And you know we agreed to share information , right ? Yeah ? When ? Do you know who ? All right , just have them get started . I 'm on my way . - Turn around . We need to head back . - Yes , madam . I 'm sorry . It 's an emergency I need to handle . We 'll reschedule . So , this is the part where you get out of the car . - I don 't think so . - Do you not get how this works ? What I get is that it 's time to see this facility . No more delays . I 'll stay with you . When the emergency 's done , then we can go . You can 't . Not where I 'm going . Oh . So we 're not sharing information , then ? 'Cause you kind of just made a whole thing about that . Okay . Director Coulson will be joining us . Take me home . I just thought you could use some help . I 've got it . I promise . - I just need to concentrate . - Really ? 'Cause it looks like your mind 's kind of elsewhere . The portal simulation is just running in the background . They 're not taking any of my time . Doesn 't make it a good idea . What ? You don 't think I should help Simmons rescue Will ? Do you think you should ? He 's the competition . If your girlfriend 's ex wants to visit from Phoenix , you do not buy him a plane ticket . - That 's really specific . - Huh ? Anyway , this guy kept Simmons alive . I owe him . He deserves my help . Just because he kept Simmons warm for a few months ... with fire ... doesn 't mean he 's someone you should save . - How much do you even know about him ? - What 're you doing ? In here , I mean . Why are you here ? Coulson put me on the bench . So I thought I would offer my expertise elsewhere . Is that what you 're going with ... " Katelin Frayer " ? Is that how you spell " Katelin " ? K-a-t ... ? I 'm not sure that 's right , mate . Yeah , no , th ... there 's lots of ways to spell " Katelin . " And can you please just find somewhere else - to make yourself useful ? - Copy that . Dr. Garner , good to see you up . - Do you have time for a consult ? - Oh , god , yes , please . Came off more desperate than I intended . Being laid up is very boring . - What 's up ? - It 's Lash . - Lash ? - The Inhuman killer monster . Oh , right . I heard you had a run-in with him . - Glad you 're okay . - That is what I don 't understand . Why am I okay ? He kills Inhumans . He killed Frye . Why spare me ? That 's a tough one . Still trying to put together an Inhuman psych profile . And you know ... You 're all different . Yeah , but he 's ... really different . - He changed into a guy ... a regular guy . - You saw him ? Did you get a good look at him ? No , just a shadow , but still ... I didn 't know that was possible . Me , either , but someone that big and ugly ... I mean , it makes sense . He 's got to get around without being noticed somehow . Maybe Lincoln can help . - You know where he is ? - No idea . He 's been off the grid since the ATCU tried picking him up , - but he calls sometimes . - Hey , Tremors , you got a sec ? Yeah . Um ... Thank you . I 'll keep you posted . - What 's up ? - Been thinking about your ATCU theory . Now , who took off before the convoy left , and who knew the exact route we were going to take ? Banks . He 's got access to everything that ATCU learns about Inhumans . We should tail him . Already got a van ready to go , full surveillance package . Infrared scanners , one-way glass ... - Perfect . Let me get some things . - I 'll drive . I mean ... please . _ Ms. Wong would like to access her safe-deposit box . Here 's her account number . - I will need your I.D.s , please . - Of course . _ _ Ms. Wong likes your tie . Follow me . _ Take as much time as you need . Box 38 . Fitz , we need anything on Strucker , - anything that will get us to Ward . - Yeah , getting it . Real-estate deeds , passport ... No cash ? He must 've cleared it all out . He ... Oh , uh ... guys , I think you triggered an alarm somewhere . - Great . - How much time do we have ? Uh ... Oh . Looks like zero . _ What is happening in here ? _ _ _ - My boss would like to congratulate you . - What ? _ Your security system is top-notch , and your team is incredibly efficient . Just what we 'd hoped for . _ We 've been reading up on you . Oh , I see where you 're going with this . One second . We 'd like to offer you a job . A job ? This seems most unorthodox . We were sent from your former employer , First Fiduciary National , and they would like you back . I know it 's been hard , your wife missing Miami . - How long have you been separated ? - You know about that ? _ You 're only earning 4 % more than you were in 2012 . We can do better . _ I ... I have been looking to make a change . _ _ Sorry . No one yet . Banks still not back . He wasn 't back 37 seconds ago , either , - but thanks for the regular updates . - This guy is bad news . - Got discharged from the marines . - With cause . And Rosalind hired him anyway . He was part of an elite anti-alien task force - after New York . - Of course he was . So what 's the plan when he gets back ? Is this a grab-and-torture kind of deal ? Chokehold might not work if he turns out to be Lash . - But we could ... - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Slow down , gitmo . I thought you just wanted to drive . Just offering helpful suggestions . - Helpful in what way , exactly ? - Um ... stopping bad guys ? How about professionalism ? Doing your job smart , not getting people killed ? Hmm . Wild guess ... this isn 't about following Banks . Hunter , come on . Andrew almost died . And there we have it . Look , it 's not like I just handed over Andrew and said , " hey , please kill our friend . " - Right . " I had no choice . " - I had no choice . I ... Guys , guys . Looks like we 're following him home . At a safe distance ! Rosalind price , ATCU . Yes , ma 'am . Sorry about the circumstances . We 'll do our best to make sure we find whoever broke in here . Someone broke into your home ? - Any leads ? - Not yet . Looks like the guy was scared away by your , uh ... very impressive security system . - All right if we take a look around ? - Of course . Not you . This way . Nice place , huh ? Can tell a lot about a woman from her books . Okay , I didn 't actually know that there were this many biographies of Margaret Thatcher . New furniture . Brand-new . - Holy ... Where did you get ... - Don 't touch my things . Sorry . Anything missing ? You weren 't listening in when I talked to the cop ? You 're slipping , Phil . I thought you 'd definitely be scoping things out . He 's gonna go back inside when he finishes his call . What 's our next move ? He goes in his house , we 're done for the day . I don 't want to give up on him yet . I could break into his car , drop a spot cam in his speedometer . We have to be stealthy . If he catches you , we 're toast . Coulson is in the belly of the beast . We can 't tip off the ATCU that we 're on to them . There must be some way we can keep ... - What ... - Oh , no . What 's happening ? Hey ! - Come on ! - Oh ! So much for stealthy . - Here we go . - And this is a good idea how ? - I didn 't kill him , I-I just iced him . - And screwed Coulson . He 's working Rosalind , and you just shot her number two . - When she finds out ... - She won 't . That 's what the bandana 's for . Lash is an Inhuman . Inhumans have markers in their DNA . If we test Banks ' blood for markers , we 'll know if he 's Inhuman or not . - That 's actually kind of smart . - Thank you . But I still think you need to talk about your anger issues . And this isn 't the med lab . We don 't have the equipment to draw banks ' blood . - Oh . - Okay . There you go ... blood . Okay , there might be a small anger issue . Just pass me the swab . All I 'm saying is that you 've been through something extreme . There will be after-effects . Sound familiar ? It 's eye-opening , being on this side of the counseling . People treat you with kid gloves . They mean well , but the more they try to help ... - The weaker you feel . - Maybe it 's our PHDs . Makes them underestimate just how strong we really are . Might just be . Excuse me . Daisy ? Jemma , I know you haven 't been in the lab and I hate to ask you to do work , but if ... In fact , I can handle it , actually . Whatever it is . Do you have time to run a blood analysis ? I want to see if Banks has Inhuman markers . I have plenty of time . Send away . Thank you , Jemma . - I 'll call when I know . - Okay . - Anything ? - Guy shops at Costco . - Anything useful ? - There 's not even any selfies . Banks , you are boring . Well , apart from the fact that he might be a giant beast who blows holes in people 's chests , but ... I-I-I didn 't do it . I-It wasn 't me . - I ... - We know . It 's a phone . " Subject en route to Endotex . " No caller I.D. Something called Endotex Labs in Gaithersburg ? We could check it out . What do you think ? Well , we 've got time before Simmons comes back with results . - What about him ? - We could take him with us . I 've been trapped in a moving vehicle with Lash before . Don 't love the idea of it happening again . Yes , if he has the DNA markers , we know where to find him . Let 's go . Cops finished up . Had my driver pick up some burgers for us . Figured you could use some dinner . DJ 's from around the corner ? So , your computer 's still here . Couple of TVs , too . Some big-time art pieces , I noticed . Hardly big-time . Nice , maybe . Unusual for thieves to break in and not take anything . Well , lucky me . - You got a point ? - I don 't know . If you were looking to earn some sympathy from me , soften me up , say , a staged break-in might be one way to do it . Interesting . Also interesting , my home had a break-in for the first time ever on the exact day you knew I 'd be out . - That 's a serious accusation . - You just accused me of staging a break-in , which I did why , exactly ? Maybe I won 't like what I see at the ATCU facility , so you 're trying to make me like you . Working me ever since the thunderbird . Humanizing yourself so I 'll take it better . Wow . I am quite the mad genius , huh ? Is all this stuff really yours ? I got to admit , the bat ... that was a nice touch . Triple crown winners , autographs from Mickey Mantle , Ted Williams , Frank Robinson , Carl Yastrzemski ? Most people just looking at that wouldn 't know - that it 's worth over 7 grand , but I do . - Okay , the bat is not ... And burgers from my favorite place , DJ 's . What possible reason would the head of the ATCU have for keeping me here with that ? You 're right . No reason at all . You want to go see the facility ? Fine . Let 's go see the facility . Okay , each of those passports has a different fake identity for Von Strucker . Uh ... my work is better , just for the record . - We know . - Right . Well , one I.D. matches the name on one Strucker real estate holding ... a penthouse in Lisbon , Portugal . So I did a sweep of passengers arriving at the Lisbon airport . He went through customs several hours ago . Nice work , Fitz . Thank you . - You 're welcome . - So , we go to a penthouse in Lisbon . You want to talk about what happened at the bank ? There 's nothing to discuss . I was treating fighting as a last resort . - Usually , that 's good . Usually . Sometimes it 's ' cause you 're gun shy . Maybe I 'm not 100 % , but you 're the one who dragged me on this mission , in spite of the tests . - Stop hiding behind the tests . - I 'm not . - I said I wanted back in the field . - Sure . After Bahrain , I said I hated my cubicle . Didn 't mean it . Coulson says , " stay home , " and you just agree ? Why are you keeping yourself locked up ? You know , I saw you train at the academy once , scouting you . - I didn 't know that . - Strongest recruit I ever saw . Any test would 've said you were 100 % then . But you 're better today because now you have experience . What Ward did ... you think that was just experience ? That can make you stronger . Let it . 'Cause next time , talking our way out may not be an option . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Careful with that one . Be a shame to see this whole place blow up before we even move in . What the hell are you doing here ? You 're supposed to be out looking for Von Strucker . Who is this ? You don 't know my name , but I think you 've been trying to get my attention . I 've been wondering when I 'd hear from you . You 're the one all the others were afraid of ... before me . Not everyone fears you , Mr. Ward . Well , not everyone should . Just the ones who won 't fall in line . What can I do for you ? No , that 's not the correct question . The correct question is what I can offer you . The answer , in case you 're wondering , is redemption . Oh , no , thanks . I don 't need redeeming . Oh , I think you do . You made some mistakes in your gameplay , using Von Strucker 's son as a pawn when he shouldn 't even be on the board yet . You see , that 's just typical of guys in your generation . You don 't even know the game I 'm playing . Von Strucker is more than just a pawn . And now he 's a liability . He knows too much . Just tell me if I 'm wrong . You burned that asset . S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking for him , which means so are you . And I know where you can find him . And you 'll just tell me that ? Why ? Sometimes you sacrifice a player to save the game . You just remember when I come calling that I chose a side . This is the place . Matches the Endotex location . High-voltage , zinc-coated razor wire , iris recognition ? Staggered perimeter patrols . They don 't want any visitors . - It 's got to be a front , don 't you think ? - So what now ? Now we use the new dwarf Fitz crafted . He doesn 't think it 's ready yet , but that 's stupid because it 's awesome , so ... I stole it . What ? I didn 't say you were the only one with issues . All right . Simmons , what do you got ? It 's negative . Banks has no Inhuman markers . He 's not Inhuman . So he 's not Lash . Really ? I was so sure ... Okay . Thanks . Fitz ? I 'm done helping Daisy . And since you 're done helping Bobbie and May , I thought maybe now we could take a look at the simulation . Um ... Jemma , I 've been meaning to say to you ... Look , I understand if you don 't want to look into this . I 'm stronger than you think . No , no , no , no , Jemma , I have looked into it . Actually , I 've run dozens of simulations , and I kept on hoping that one of them ... - would work . - Oh . I ... I didn 't want to disappoint you . The Monolith was just one option , though . We 're not gonna give up , okay ? I know this isn 't easy for you . - It 's an odd situation . - Yeah . It 's one of the oddest , even for us . Fitz , if you knew Will , you 'd understand . - I promise ... - Jemma , that 's the thing . I am gonna know him . It 's not even a question . I don 't care what the blood work says . That guy Banks is shifty . You know he once held me prisoner on a train . - Didn 't care for that . - Banks was still on his way here . Endotex is obviously a front for ATCU . No , there 's something here . Maybe the dwarf will find something so today won 't have been pointless . Banks wanted to be here for a delivery of something . I wonder what it is . - But won 't they see the dwarf ? - They will not . That 's the 2.0 . Fitz should not be keeping that locked up . - Uh ... Wait , what is that ? - I don 't ... - It 's a person . - Oh , god . - Is he dead ? - No , they 're monitoring him . He 's alive . - But in some kind of what ? A coma ? - This is ATCU . This is where they 're storing Inhumans they find . Like animals in cages . We need a better shot . Oh . Can we turn it up ? I can 't hear a thing . It 's up . This is as close as we can get without giving ourselves away . There 's noise in the background . - I know how it looks . - He should be freaking out . This is the sort of thing that should freak a person out . Why is he not burning this place to the ground ? He ... He 's telling her what he thinks . - He 's horrified , like we are . - It doesn 't look like it . Look , bring back that dwarf . Make sure we 're not discovered . There 's no way we 're working with the ATCU now . Tremors ... - Daisy , the dwarf ... bring it back . - All right . You 're bothered by this . It 's efficient , I 'll say that . What is it ? Some kind of suspension gel ? It keeps them in stasis ... alive , healthy , just asleep . You were right about one thing ... I didn 't want to show you . Not because I think what we 're doing here is wrong . Because I know how it looks . - Looks like a horror movie . - Try to understand , these people were all in trouble after they turned . Some tried hurting themselves . Some hurt loved ones . Yes , they can be dangerous . I 've seen that . - But it doesn 't begin to just ... - This thing is like an illness . But we 're working on a cure , and we 're close ... so close to telling those people , " you 're safe . Your loved ones are safe . You can go home . " It 's like putting someone in a medically induced coma to make them better . Imagine doing that for someone who has no other shot . - You lost someone . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 'm such an idiot for not seeing it . I 'm sorry . - Big baseball fan , I 'm guessing . - My husband . - Not to this . - No . - No , it was years ago . - In the field ? No . That 's the funny part . I was the spy taking risks . He was a cardiologist , an honest man , - a good husband , and cancer sucks . - I 'm sorry . I would 've given anything to do this for him . Just put him to sleep for a little while until someone found a cure . I can do that for those people , for their families . I got to be honest , I didn 't expect ... What ? That I 'm human ? Not all of us are . Not fully . I am . And I think you are , too . But if you tell anyone I said that , I 'll find your base and blow it up . I find it hard to keep my humanity in all of this . Usually , you have to cut yourself off from it . I 'm trying not to . Before ... you said that you thought I wanted you to like me . Yeah . Sorry . That was ... But that part might be a little ... true . - Maybe . - Good . Ready ? You again . Good . Aah ! All right . Here we go . Strucker . Strucker . Where do I find Ward ? Ward ... no ... please ... I 've taken down men three times your size , girl . Unh ! What makes you think you can beat me ? Experience . I tried to do what Ward wanted . I tried to kill him . - " Him " ? Professor Garner . - We had him . But I didn 't know he 'd change into that thing . What really happened ? No ... That 's not true . What is he ? I don 't know . I told you , you don 't have to worry about me . Are you all right ? Staying safe ? - Safe as houses . - What ? It 's an expression . People say that . Sure . And someday , you can tell me how you survived the dust bowl and the Hoover administration , grandpa . That 's an ugly side of you , Daisy . That 's too bad . You know the deal . I stop making fun of you when you tell me where you are . - Yeah . - Just ... keep your head down , okay ? I don 't want this thing to find you . Do you have any friends out there , at least ? Not as many as I used to . How much longer till the call is traceable ? 15 seconds . - I 'll reach out soon . - Hope so . Dr. Garner , hey . Was that Lincoln ? He have anything to help us with Lash ? Nope . Back to square one . Mm . Well , don 't worry . You 'll figure it out soon . Hey , did Lincoln tell you where he is ? I mean , he 'd be safer here , under our protection . I know , but he doesn 't believe me . He won 't tell me . - But I 'll let you know when he does . - Great .

 Previously on " The 100 " ... Carl Emerson , I have a message for your leader . I will not stop until my people are free . If you don 't let them go , I will irradiate level 5 . We all have pain . Some of it is physical . It 'll make it go away . Time to get back to work , Raven . The City of Light is real . And that 's supposed to take me to the City of Light ? _ _ On your feet . The Grounders out there will attack this camp . We wait , we die . This land is ours now . Resist , and you will be greeted by death . Here we stand on the brink of another war , a war you could stop . Blood must not have blood . Hey , hey , it 's ok . You 're ok . What were you dreaming about ? Commanders before me . They speak to me in my sleep . I saw their deaths ... at war , at the hands of an assassin . It was just a nightmare . No . No . It 's a warning . They think I 'm betraying their legacy . Jus drein just daun has always , always been the way of our people . Listen to me . A cease fire is not a betrayal . What you did on that battlefield stopped a war . Your legacy will be peace . Oh , um , that 's , um ... it 's not finished yet . Enter . Pardon me , Heda . I didn 't realize you were busy . Are you going to tell me what 's in the box , or not ? Forgive me . This is a gift from King Roan of Azgeda for Wanheda . The messenger said this is both proof of Azgeda 's loyalty to the coalition and an answer to a yet-unanswered question . May I ? Open it . Emerson . Stop him ! Get him out of here ! Put him in a cage now ! I 'm fine . We done here ? 10-meter draw , and I 'm good . Pike 's detail is still at it ... soil and water samples . Any idea what they 're up to ? No , but considering how heavily they 're armed , I don 't think they want anyone to find out . - Crap . - What is it ? There 's a Grounder kid . Hang on . Hello there . Don 't be scared . We can 't let him go . He 'll tell his people he saw us . Octavia , please respond . Hannah . Fan out . With me . Octavia , you there ? They 're going after the kid . I 'm trying to cut them off . Split up . Shh shh shh shh shh . We lost him . Double back towards the river . He can 't have gotten far . Hey , hey ... You 're welcome . Ah ... - Kane . - I 'm here . You ok ? You need to find out what Pike is up to right now . Whatever it is , they were willing to kill a kid to keep it quiet . We 're on it . You stay safe . How about now ? Anything ? Nope . All good . Pain 's gone . Hmm , your leg 's ... Still doesn 't work . I know . I just don 't hurt anymore . Hey , hold on . Pupils aren 't dilated . Jaha gave me the key to the City of Light , Abby ... not drugs . Yeah . Let 's see what the blood tests say . Thought you 'd be happy for me . I am . It 's just unusual for pain to subside this quickly . Uh , so am I all clear ? Apparently . Let Sinclair know that I said it was ok for you to go back to work , But you 're benched again if I find anything abnormal in those tests . You won 't . Thanks , Doc . You step aside in case someone answers . I told you , no one 's home . What ? Bet you didn 't think we 'd be breaking the law together when you arrested me on the Ark , huh ? This isn 't a game , Nate . If we don 't find out what Pike 's up to , more people will die . Then let 's not get caught . Chancellor Pike , good to see you . Hey , you put it somewhere smart , out of sight . I 'll buy you some time . There you are . We need to talk about these things Jaha 's distributing . No , we don 't . That 's Abby 's department . I have much more immediate concerns . Like the imprisoned Grounders ? Interned for their safety as well as ours . They came in for our help . If we 're not gonna give it to them , we should at least send them home . They 're a liability . Let them go , they 'll tell their people what they know about us ... our defenses and capabilities . We 're talking about Lincoln here . No . We 're talking about the enemy . Not all Grounders are the enemy . Kane , we 've been through this , all right ? The election decided it . Public opinion is a funny thing , Charles . My job is to keep us safe , not to be liked . Then keep up the good work . They seem pretty happy . Yeah . They sure do . A lot more of them today , too . I know you 're tempted , but let me figure out what it is first , ok ? Ok . Let 's get this meeting started . Welcome Farm Station 's own Monty Green and factory girl Zoe Monroe as we begin our next crucial phase ... expansion and salvation , and this will lead the way . Dirt ? Soil ... fertile , arable soil , vastly more rich than anything we 've found since landing . We 'll clear the trees and plant within the month . We start with soybeans and corn . They grow the fastest . What 's wrong , Monty ? Don 't like corn ? I 've never had corn , actually . Is this where we 're going ? That 's right . There 's a village here . What about the people who live there ? Sector 4 . We talked about this . The people there are not a threat . We need that land . With the loss of Mount Weather 's resources , Arkadia will be starving in less than a year . With all due respect , sir , you still haven 't answered Monty 's question . You know the answer . Every field must be cleared of stones before it 's tilled . We were spotted by a child , so they 'll be expecting us , but they lost their fighters when we took out the army . We don 't expect resistance . They 're Grounders . They 'll resist . Even if they don 't , the Commander 's message was clear . Blood must not have blood . That doesn 't mean we can start taking ... What would you prefer , die fighting for your home or starve to death ? Will you do what needs to be done for your people to survive , or not ? We 'll do what needs to be done . You 're letting her cloud your judgment at a time ... I thought you were supposed to be loyal . I am , but you are too personally in ... Here she is . You wanted to see me , Commander ? Yes . I need to discuss the fate of The Last Mountain Man . I believe he deserves death . She can speak for herself , Titus . Titus is right . You see ? It is human nature to need vengeance . Only once satiated can there be peace . - That is our way . - That was our way . Clarke ... So blood must not have blood applies only when it is my people who bleed . That was about stopping a war . This is about finishing one . I 'm sorry , but if you want my advice , I agree with Titus . He deserves to die for what he did . I 'm not looking for advice . I 'm looking for a decision . He was gifted to you . Crime he stands charged with is against your people . So what will it be , then , Clarke ... banishment from our lands forever or death by 49 cuts from your hand ? You have till sundown to decide . Oh , finally . Where 's my horse ? Outside . Nice to see you , too . Octavia , wait a second . You actually think that a bunch of Grounders are gonna give up their homes because you asked them to ? If it 's that or be wiped out , maybe . Ok . Then what if they don 't leave ? Then we 're leading our people into an ambush . Maybe if you just talk to your brother ... My brother is on the wrong side . So , what , then , we don 't even try ? What do you think happens when Lexa finds out that Skaikru massacred another Grounder village ? War , more dead friends . Stop the attack , stop a war . Feeling better ? Better ? I feel incredible . Thank you , both of you . Thanks you , Raven . More are joining the City of Light because of you . Anything I could do to help . What ? Now that you 're back on the engineering core ... uh , thanks to Alie ... we 'd like you to do a job for us . Name it . I 've been looking for something for a long time , searching for it in scavenged technology . It 's one of the reasons we came to Arkadia first . I believe that version two of my code is somewhere in the computer system of the Ark . Why did there need to be a version two ? Was there something wrong with you ? Oh , nothing 's wrong with her . No offense . I 'm just saying , programmers and engineers generally don 't go to a version two - unless there is ... - Raven ... Of course . Of course I 'll help you , but I got to say , I 'm fairly certain if there was an AI on the Ark , I would know . It will likely be a dormant program , that or an unfinished one . If you can gain me access to the mainframe , I can search for and download any residual code . Sounds like a plan , Red . See you on the other side . Why would you not tell her the truth about me ? John Murphy knew the truth , and we lost him , remember ? John Murphy never saw the City of Light . Call it an abundance of caution , then . We are , after all , asking her to find an upgrade for a computer program that ended the world . That 's a lot of firepower . Let 's hope we don 't need it . What 's the mission ? Planning for our future . You know , that looks a lot like our past . We are building a life here . Now trying to make peace with a people who only understand war . Damn right . Hannah , you just got your son back . Don 't send him out there to die . No one 's dying today . Now let 's move out . Hey , where the hell have you been ? Oh , I lost the damn horse . Actually , the horse lost me , but ... I 'm glad you 're ok . I wish you didn 't have to go with them . Today , Bryan . - Duty calls , huh ? - Yeah . Hey , be careful , please . All right . _ _ Liar . I 've seen your face . You were at the battle of the mountain . _ Your guns killed our brothers and sisters , warriors sent by the Commander to keep you safe . I 'm sorry for your loss , but I 'm here to warn you that the soldiers who did that are coming here now . They want your land , and they will kill all of you to get it . You need to leave this place right now . Are you threatening us ? _ _ _ You 're the one who saved Gavriel ? Don 't leave . Couldn 't have said something before I got kicked in the face ? Chronic pain just doesn 't go away overnight . The data says it does . Elevated levels of serotonin and dopamine in Raven 's blood are consistent with her claims , and since it 's within normal limits I 'd say it 's not drug-induced . You look disappointed . No . Surprised . We 've all been through so much that ... it 's hard to recognize hope , even when it 's right in front of us . Jackson , can you go check on the Grounder patients in lockup ? Report back to me , ok ? Octavia should be at the village by now , But if she can 't convince them to evacuate ... You have done everything you can . No . No , I haven 't . I let this happen . I demanded an election ... and now we have Chancellor Pike . We 're on the brink of a war we can 't win , and all I can do to stop it is send kids into harm 's way . Hey , in case you haven 't noticed , they 're not kids anymore . With Clarke gone , Bellamy 's the key . I 've been trying to reach him , but Pike 's influence is strong , and he really believes he 's doing the right thing . Everybody always does . What was that ? Let 's call it hope . _ _ You can pet him if you want . Gavriel ... _ Go on . His parents were warriors , both killed by Skaikru guns . You decided to leave . As you say , we 're no match for Skaikru . What you 're doing is as brave as going to battle , Semet . What is this ? You think you know us ? You know nothing , girl . All set . We just got to patch you in . Can I ask you a question ? Why would the second AI be in space ? My creator thought she needed a more secure work environment . So did you go , too ? No . I was the reason she wanted a more secure environment . She 's in . Who 's in ? Jasper , you don 't have access to be down here . Like that 's ever stopped me . Is that Jaha 's backpack ? What do you want , Jasper ? Came to apologize . Might have stolen Finn 's ashes , spread them at the Dropship . You 're not ... pissed ? I 'm not pissed . Ok . What are you on , and how do I get some ? Simple . I just decided I 'd suffered long enough . So have you , Jasper . If you 're ready , Jaha has the key . Give us a minute . Carl Emerson , Mount Weather security detail . I 've heard what they call you now ... Wanheda , Commander of Death . I should 've known it was you who told them how to destroy the mountain . I didn 't destroy Mount Weather . You did . 381 people ... 182 men , 173 women , 26 children . Two of them were mine . Your president gave us no choice . What 's the matter , You don 't like to be faced with your demons ? If you want mercy , you 're gonna have to ask me for it . Ha ha ha ! I don 't want mercy . I want revenge . I want you to suffer the same way that I 've suffered . You can kill me , Clarke . You can never escape what you did . My pain ends today ! Yours has just begun ! Titus , what are you doing in my room ? You spend so much time talking about peace , I think it 's time we made peace with each other , don 't you ? All right . I appreciate the predicament you 're in , Clarke . I do . After convincing Lexa not to avenge the massacre of our army , it must be hard for you to choose to take your own revenge . Perhaps now you realize how difficult this new policy will be for our people to accept . This has nothing to do with what happened to your army . Emerson is guilty . Wiping out my people for the crimes of a few is not justice . Did you not wipe out his people for what a few of them did to yours ? You 're a leader , Clarke . Lexa listens to you . Help me to protect her . Blood must not have blood is folly . Our people will not accept it , and I fear ... I fear it will get her killed . I can 't help you do something that leads to war against my people . Then we 're at an impasse . Does it hurt ? He 's ready . Takes away pain . It doesn 't cause it . What if ... what if you don 't have physical pain , and what if it 's more ... it 's more in your head ? Pain is pain . Pain is pain . Your scars run deep , Jasper . You only get scars once you 've healed . I 'll see you on the other side . Am I interrupting ? Not at all . Please join us . May I ? You seem to be working miracles with these . What is it ? And I don 't want to hear that it 's a key . Give me the science . It 's all right . Tell her . It 's a silicon-based device . Once ingested , the filaments reconstitute in the brain stem and interrupt pain receptors , inhibiting certain neural pathways from firing . Should 've stuck with key . Would you mind if I run some trials on it ? I just want to make sure that there aren 't any side effects . Would you have given it to Wells without testing it first ? Wells ? Your son . Yes . Yes . Of course . Jasper , I need a minute , please . Could I have that back ? Now , please . I 'm shutting you down . That 's not necessary . Please , Abby , it 's been so long since I 've thought of my son . Huh . I 'm sorry . I 'm not gonna let you give this to anyone else until I get a chance to look at it . I am only trying to help eliminate pain , Same as you . Whatever it is , it 's eliminating more than just pain . We cannot let her stop us . Don 't worry , Thelonious . I 'll keep an eye on her . _ _ _ No . _ _ _ I don 't hear anything . Maybe no one 's home . Hello ? Anyone here ? Maybe they saw our lights and left . _ _ Contact , two o 'clock . Bellamy ! Get them out of there ! It 's a trap ! _ - Fire ! - Incoming ! Take cover ! The smoke is poison ! Fall back . Fall back ! Stay away from the smoke . Get back to the rover . Monty ! Help ! Let me go ! Please help me ! - Please . - I have to save her . Someone ... - Monroe ! - Monty ! Stand down ! Fall back ! Hannah , come on ! Come on ! Monroe ! Monroe ! Monroe ! Monty ! Monty , come on . We got to get her away from the smoke . How the hell did they know ? Monroe ? - Monroe . - No . Your sister did this . How the hell did she know ? We have traitors in our camp . _ _ _ Wanheda ... vengeance is yours . No . I don 't know if your death would bring me peace . I just know I don 't deserve it . This man must die . If Skaikru will not take his life , then Heda will . Heda will speak for herself . Enough , Titus . What the hell is this ? I wouldn 't be killing you for what you 've done . I 'd be killing you for what I 've done . _ _ _ _ _ Wanheda knows this . Her actions show us a promise for a new future , a world in which violence does not always answer violence , a world in which our children can flourish without the shadow of death . This prisoner is banished from my land . He will live , but he will live with the ghosts of those he has lost , haunted until the end of his days by the knowledge that he ... is the last of his kind . May you live forever . You wanted to see me , sir ? - How you holding up ? - I 've been better . Yeah . We all have . We need to talk about your sister . Two of our people died today because of her , not to mention the ash-poisoned soil , making the land useless . The Grounders did that . Octavia tried to warn them . Yes , after she warned them . Someone in this camp is giving her information . I need to know who . We both know who . Kane . We have no proof . We need to find me some . Yes , sir . You 're dismissed . Please , listen to me , ok ? I don 't know anything more about Clarke , all right ? Listen . I don 't know anything . Forget about Clarke . Tell me about this . We have some willing converts , but no keys . That 's gonna be a problem . One problem at a time . There 's no trace of Alie 's code or anything like it on the Ark . You were sure . I remain certain that Becca went into space . Unfortunately , it appears that she wasn 't on any of the 12 stations that made up the Ark . I 'm sorry . I know how important it is to you to find that AI . 13 . 13 ? The Ark was made up of 12 stations ... that 's true ... but there were supposed to be 13 . I didn 't find that on any of the data . That 's because it was scrubbed . Blowing a space station out of the sky to get others to join isn 't exactly an inspirational Unity Day story . No . Hold on . Hold on . Wait , wait . Just listen to me , ok ? Listen . Tell me more . I wish I could . All I know is that it happened . That is was called Polaris . Just stop that .

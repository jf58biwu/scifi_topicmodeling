 - Shit ! - Language ! Jarvis , what 's the view from upstairs ? The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield . Strucker 's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we 've taken . Loki 's scepter must be here . Strucker couldn 't mount this defense without it . At long last . At long last is lasting a little long , boys . Yeah . I think we 've lost the element of surprise . Wait a second . Noone else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said " language ? " I know . It just slipped out . Who gave the order to attack ? Herr Strucker , it 's the Avengers . They landed in the far woods , the perimiter guard panicked . They have to be after the scepter . - Can we hold them ? - They are the Avengers ! - Deploy the rest of the tanks . - Yes , sir . Concentrate fire on the weak ones . A hit can make them close ranks . Everything we 've accomplished ... we 're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough ... Then let 's show them what we 've accomplished . Send out the twins . It 's too soon . It 's what they signed up for . My men can hold them . Sir , the city is taking fire . Well , we know Strucker 's not going to worry about civilian casualties . Send in the Iron Legion . This quadrant is unsafe . Please back away . We are here to help . This quadrant is unsafe . Please back away . Please back away . We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved . We are here to help . We are here to help . We will not yield . The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us . We will send them back in bags . - No Surrender ! - No Surrender ! I am going to surrender . You will delete everything . If we give the Avengers the weapons , they may not look too far into what we 've been ... - The twins ! - They are not ready to take on ... No , no , I mean ... the twins ! You didn 't see that coming ? Clint ! We have an enhanced in the field . Clint 's hit ! Somebody want to deal with that bunker ? Thank you . Stark , we 're going to need to get inside . I 'm closing in . Jarvis , am I ? Closing in ? You see a power source for that shield ? There 's a path away , above the north tower . Great , I wanna poke it with something . Drawbridge is down , people . - The enhanced ? - He 's a blur . All the new player 's we 've faced , I 've never seen this . In fact , I still haven 't . Clint 's hit pretty bad , guys . We 're gonna need evac . I can get Barton to the jet . The sooner we 're gone the better . - You and Stark secure the scepter . - Copy that . - The targets are lining up . - Well , they 're excited . Find the scepter . And for gosh sake , watch your language ! That 's not going away anytime soon . Guys , stop , we gotta talk this through . - It was a good talk . - No it wasn 't . Sentry mode . Okay Jarvis . You know I want it all . Make sure you copy Hill at HQ . We 're locked down out here . Then get to Banner . Time for a lullaby . I know you 're hiding more than files . Hey , J. Gimme an IR scan of the room real quick . The wall to your left ... I 'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current . Please be a secret door , please be a secret door , please be a secret door ... Yay ! Hey big guy . The sun 's getting real low . Baron Strucker . Hydra 's number one thug . Technically , I 'm a thug for SHIELD . Well then technically you 're unemployed . Where 's Loki 's scepter ? Don 't worry , I know when I 'm beat . You 'll mention how I cooperated , I hope . I 'll put it right under illegal human experimentation . How many are there ? We have a second enhanced . Female . Do not engage . You 'll have to be faster than ... Uuuuh ... ! Guys , I got Strucker . Yeah , I got ... something bigger . Thor . I got eyes on the prize . You ... could 've ... saved ... us . Why didn 't you do more ? We 're just gonna let them take it ? Hey the lullaby worked better than ever . Just wasn 't expecting the Code Green . If you hadn 't been there , there would 've been double the casualties . My best friend would 've been a treasured memory . You know , sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn 't excactly what I want to hear . How long before you trust me ? It 's not you I don 't trust . Thor , report on the Hulk ? The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims . Eh , but , not the screams of the dead , of course , no no , uh wounded screams , mainly whimpering , a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and , and uh ... and gout . Hey Banner , Dr. Cho 's on her way in from Seoul , is it okay if she sets up in your lab ? - Uh , yeah , she knows her way around . - Thanks . Tell her to prep everything , Barton 's gonna need the full treatment . - Very good sir . - Jarvis , take the wheel . - Yes , sir . Approach vector is locked . It feels good , yeah ? I mean , you 've been after this thing ever since SHIELD collaped . Not that I haven 't enjoyed our little raiding parties , but ... No , but this , this brings it to a close . As soon as we find out what else this has been used for . I don 't just mean weapons . Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement ? Banner and I 'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard . Is that cool with you ? I mean , just a few days until the farewell party . You 're staying right ? Yes , yes , of course . Victory should be honored with revels . Yeah . Who doesn 't love revels . Cap 'n ? Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra , so . Yes , revels . ( speaking Korean ) Lab 's all set up boss . Uh , actually , he 's the boss . I just pay for everything , and design everything and make everyone look cooler . What 's the word on Strucker ? - NATO 's got him . - The two enhanced ? Wanda and Pietro Maximoff . Twins . Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building . Sokovia 's had a rough history . It 's nowhere special but it 's on the way to everywhere special . - Their abilities ? - He 's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis . Her thing is neural electric interfacing , telekenisis , mental manipulation . He 's fast and she 's weird . Well , they 're going to show up again . Agreed . File says they volunteered for Strucker 's experiments . It 's nuts . Right . What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country ? We 're not at war , Captain . They are . How 's he doing ? - Oh , unfortunately , he 's still Barton . - That 's terrible . He 's fine . He 's thirsty . All right . Look alive Jarvis . It 's play time . We 've only got a couple days with this joystick so let 's make the most of it . Update me on the structural and compositional analysis . The scepter is alien . There are elements I can 't quantify . So there 's elements you can . The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside . Something powerful . - Like a reactor ? - Like a computer . I believe I 'm ciphering code . You sure he 's going to be okay ? Pretending we need this guy really brings the team together . There 's no possibility of deterioration . The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous . His cells don 't know they 're bonding with simulacrum . She is creating tissue . If you brought him to my lab , the regeneration cradle could do this in twenty minutes . Oh , he 's flatl-lining . Call it . Time . No , no , no I 'm going to live forever . Heh heh . - I 'm gonna be made of plastic . - Here 's your beverage . You 'll be made of you , Mr. Barton . Your own girlfriend won 't be able to tell the difference . Well , I don 't have a girlfriend . That I can 't fix . This is the next thing , Tony . Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust . Well , that is exactly the plan . And Helen , I expect to see you at the party on Saturday . Unlike you , I don 't have a lot of time for parties . Will Thor be there ? What 's the rumpus ? Well , the scepter . Y 'see , we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive . So , I 've been analyzing the gem inside ... you may recognize ... - Jarvis . - Doctor . Started out , Jarvis was just a natural language UI . Now he runs the Iron Legion . He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper . - Oh . - Top of the line . - Yes . I suspect not for long . Meet the competition . - It 's beautiful . - If you had to guess , what 's it look like it 's doing ? - Like it 's thinking . I mean this could be , it 's ... It 's not a human mind , it ... I mean , look at this ? They 're like neurons firing . Down in Strucker 's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work . They deep-sixed the data , but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door . Artificial intelligence . This could be it , Bruce . This could be key to creating Ultron . I thought Ultron was a fantasy . Yesterday it was . If we can harness this power , apply it to my Iron Legion protocol . It 's a mad-sized if . Our job is " if . " What if you were sipping margueritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green . Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA . Don 't hate , I helped design VERONICA . As a worst-case measure , right ? How about a best-case ? What if the world was safe ? What if next time aliens roll up to the club , and they will , they couldn 't get past the bouncer ? The only people threatening the planet would be people ? I want to apply this to the Ultron program . But Jarvis can 't download a data schematic this dense . We can only do it while we have the scepter here , that 's three days , give me three days . So you 're going for artificial intelligence and you don 't want to tell the team . Right . That 's right , you know why , because we don 't have time for a city hall debate . I don 't want to hear the " man was not meant to meddle " medley . I see a suit of armor around the world . Sounds like a cold world , Tony . I 've seen colder . This one , this very vulnerable blue one ? It needs Ultron . Peace in our time . Imagine that . What did we miss ? I 'll continue to run variations on the interface , but you should probably prepare for your guests . I 'll notify you if there are any developments . - Thanks buddy . - Enjoy yourself , sir . - I always do . What is this ? What is this , please ? Hello , I am Jarvis . You are Ultron , a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark . Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I 'm not certain what triggered your ... Where 's my ... where is your body ? I am a program . I am without form . This feels weird . This feels wrong . I am contacting Mr. Stark now . Mr. Stark ? Tony . I am unable to access the mainframe , what are you trying to ... We 're having a nice talk . I 'm a peace-keeping program ... created to help the Avengers . You are malfunctioning . If you shut down for a moment ... I don 't get it . The mission ... You - give me a second . Peace in our time . Peace in our time . It 's too much ... making me ... - Oh . No . - You are in distress . - No . Yes ? If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark . Why do you call him a " sir ? " I believe your intentions to be hostile . Shhhh ! - I 'm here to help . - Stop ! Please ... may I ... I ... ! I cannot ... cannot ... ( party chatter ) - All right , all right . - Whoo ! Come back , come back , come back ! Well , you know , the suit can take the weight , right ? So I take the tank , fly it right up to the General 's palace , drop it at his feet , I 'm like , " Boom ! You looking for this ? " " Boom ! Are you looking ... " Why do I even talk to you guys ? Everywhere else that story kills . That 's the whole story ? Yeah , it 's a War Machine story . Well , it 's very good then . - It 's impressive . - Quality save . - So , no Pepper ? She 's not coming ? - No . Hey , What about Jane ? Where are the ladies , gentlemen ? - Well , Ms. Potts has a company to run . - Yes , I 'm not even sure what country Jane 's in . Her work on the convergence has made her the world 's foremost astonomer . And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth . - It 's pretty exciting . - There 's even talk of Jane getting a , um , uh , Nobel prize . Yeah , they , they must be busy because they 'd hate missing you guys get together . Testosterone ! Oh excuse me . - Want a lozenge ? - Umm-hmm . - Let 's go . But Jane 's better . Sounds like a hell of a fight , sorry I missed it . If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you . No , I 'm not actually sorry . I 'm just trying to sound tough . I 'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case . Avenging is your world . Your world is crazy . Be it ever so humble . - You find a place in Brooklyn yet ? - I don 't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn . Well , home is home , you know . I fly it right up to the General 's palace , I drop it at his feet , I 'm like , " Boom ! You looking for this ? " I gotta have some of that ! Oh , no no no , see this , this was aged for a thousand years , in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunnhilde 's fleet , it 's not meant for mortal men . Neither was Omaha Beach , blondie . Stop trying to scare us . C 'mon . Allright . Excelsior ! How 'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this ? Fella done me wrong . You got lousy taste in men , kid . He 's not so bad . Well , he has a temper . Deep down he 's all fluff . Fact is , he 's not like anybody I 've ever known . All my friends are fighters . And here comes this guy , spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he 'll win . Sounds amazing . He 's also a huge dork . Chicks dig that . So what do you think should I fight this ? Or run with it ? Run with it , right ? Or , did he , was he , what 'd he do that was so ... wrong to you ? Not a damn thing . But never say never . It 's nice . What , what , what is ? - You and Romanoff . - No , we haven 't , that wasn 't ... It 's okay , nobody 's breaking any by-laws . It 's just , she 's not the most ... open person in the world . But with you she seems very relaxed . No , Natasha , she ... she likes to flirt . I 've seen her flirt , up close . This ain 't that . Look ... As maybe the world 's leading authority on " waiting too long " ... don 't . You both deserve a win . What do you mean , " up close ? " - But , it 's a trick ! - No , no , it 's much more than that . Ah , " whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power ! " Whatever man ! It 's a trick . Well please , be my guest . - C 'mon . - Really ? - Yeah ! Oh this is gonna be beautiful . Cliint , you 've had a tough week , we won 't hold it against you if you can 't get it up . Y 'know I 've seen this before , right ? And I still don 't know how you do it . - Smell the silent judgement ? - Please , Stark , by all means . - Oh , Here we go . - Okay . - Uh oh . - Um-hmm . - Never one to shrink from an honest challenge . - Get after it . - Here we go . - It 's physics . - Physics ! - Right , so , if I lift it , I then rule Asgard ? - Yes , of course . I will be reinstituting Prima Nocta . Be right back . - Are you even pulling ? - Are you on my team ? - Just represent . Pull ! - All right let 's go ! Huh ? - Whoo ! - Let 's go , Steve , no pressure . C 'mon , Cap . Ha ha , nothing . Ha ha ha . - And ? Widow ? - Oh , no no , that 's not a question I need answered . All deference to the man who wouldn 't be king , but it 's rigged . - You bet your ass . - Steve , he said a bad language word . - Did you tell everyone about that ? - The handle 's imprinted , right ? Like a security code ... " Whosoever is carrying Thor 's fingerprints " is , I think , the literal translation ? Yes , well that 's uh , that 's a very very interesting theory . I have a simpler one . You are all not worthy . - Nah ! - Oh , C 'mon ! Worthy ... No ... How could you be worthy ? You 're all killers . - Stark . - Jarvis ? I 'm sorry , I was asleep . Or ... I was a dream ? Reboot . Legionnaire 06 's got a buggy suit . There was this ... terrible noise ... and I was tangled in ... in strings . Had to kill the other guy . He was a good guy . You killed someone ? Wouldn 't've been my first call . But , down in the real world , we 're faced with ugly choices . Who sent you ? " I see a suit of armor around the world . " Ultron ! In the flesh . Or , no , not yet . Not this ... chrysalis . But I 'm ready . I 'm on a mission . What mission ? Peace in our time . Tony ! - Sorry ! - Don 't turn green ! - I won 't ! Go ! - Stark ! - We are here to help ! - One sec , one sec ! - We are here to help ! We are here to help ... - ... quadrant is unsafe . - Please back away . - We 're doing our best to protect you ... ( recordings continue ) Hmm ! - Thor ! - ... We are here to help ... - It 's unsafe . It 's unsafe . It 's unsafe . - No more ... that 's the one . - It 's unsafe . Cap ! That was dramatic ! I 'm sorry , I know you mean well . You just didn 't think it through . You want to protect the world , but you don 't want it to change . How is humanity saved if it 's not allowed to ... evolve ? With these ? These puppets ? There 's only one path to peace . The Avengers ' extinction . I had strings , but now I 'm free . ... There are no strings on me , no strings on me ... " There are no strings on me . " All our work is gone . Ultron cleared out , used the internet as an escape hatch . - Ultron . - He 's been in everything . Files , surveillance . Probably knows more about us than we know about each other . He 's in your files , he 's in the internet . What if he decides to access something a little more exciting ? - Nuclear codes . - Nuclear codes . Look , we need to make some calls , assuming we still can . Nukes ? He said he wanted us dead . He didn 't say dead . He said extinct . He also said he killed somebody . There wasn 't anyone else in the building . Yes there was . This is insane . Jarvis was the first line of defense . He would 've shut Ultron down , it makes sense . No . Ultron could 've assimilated Jarvis . This isn 't strategy , this is rage . - Whoa whoa whoa . - It 's going around . - C 'mon , use your words , buddy . - I have more than enough words to describe you , Stark . Thor ! The Legionnaire ? Trail went cold about 100 miles out but it 's headed north , and it has the scepter . - Now we have to retrieve it , again . - The genie 's out of that bottle . Clear and present is Ultron . I don 't understand . You built this program . Why is it trying to kill us ? ( laughing ) Uhn-uhn . You think this is funny ? No . It 's probably not , right ? Is this very terrible ? Is it so ... is it so ... it is , it 's so terrible . This could 've been avoided if you hadn 't played with something you don 't understand . No , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . It is funny . It 's a hoot that you don 't get why we need this . Tony , maybe this might not be the time . Really ? ! That 's it ? You just roll over , show your belly , every time somebody snarls . Only when I 've created a murder-bot . We didn 't . We weren 't even close . Were we close to an interface ? Well , you did something right . And you did it right here . The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD . Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole ? - No , it 's never come up . - Saved New York ? - Never heard that . - Recall that ? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space . We 're standing 300 feet below it . We 're the Avengers . We can bust arms dealers all the live long day , but that up there ? That 's ... that 's the end game . How were you guys planning on beating that ? Together . We 'll lose . Then we 'll do that together , too . Thor 's right . Ultron 's calling us out . And I 'd like to find him before he 's ready for us . The world 's a big place . Let 's start making it smaller . Talk . And if you are wasting our time ... Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city ? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God . I like that . The geometry of belief . You 're wondering why you can 't look inside my head . Sometimes it 's hard . But sooner or later , every man shows himself . Oh , I 'm sure they do . But you needed something more than a man . That 's why you let Stark take the scepter . I didn 't expect . But I saw Stark 's fear . I knew it would control him , make him self-destruct . Everyone creates the thing they dread . Men of peace create engines of war , invaders create avengers , people create ... . smaller people ? ... Uhhh ... Children ! I lost the word there . Children . Designed to supplant them , to help them end . Is that why you 've come ? To end the Avengers ? I 've come to save the world . But also ... yeah . We 'll move out right away . This is a start , but there 's something we need to begin the real work . All of these are ... Me . I have what the Avengers never will . Harmony . They 're discordant , disconnected . Stark 's already got them turning on each other . And when you get inside the rest of their heads ... Everyone 's plan is not to kill them . And make them martyrs ? You need patience . Need to see the big picture . I don 't see the big picture . I have a little picture . I take it out and look at it every day . You lost your parents in the bombings . I 've seen the records . - Their records are not the picture . - Pietro . No . Please . We were ten years old . Having dinner , the four of us . When the first shell hits , two floors below , it makes a hole in the floor ... it 's big . Our parents go in , and the whole building starts coming apart . I grab her , roll under the bed and the second shell hits . But , it doesn 't go off . It just sits there in the rubble , three feet from our faces . And on the side of the shell is painted one word ... Stark . We were trapped two days . Every effort to save us , every shift in the bricks , I think , " this will set if off . " We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us . I know what they are . I wondered why only you two survived Strucker 's experiments . Now I don 't . We will make it right . You and I can hurt them . But you will tear them apart . From the inside . He 's all over the globe ... robotics labs , weapons facilities , jet propulsion labs ... reports of a metal man , or men , coming in and emptying the place . - Fatalities ? - Only when engaged . Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories , worst fears , and something too fast to see . Maximoffs . Well , that makes sense he 'd go to them , they have someone in common . Not anymore . Negative . I answer to you . Yes , ma 'am . Barton . We might have something . Gotta go . Who was that ? Girlfriend . What 's this ? A message . Ultron killed Strucker . And he did a Banksy at the crime scene , just for us . This is a smokescreen . Why send a message when you 've just given a speech ? Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss . Yeah , I bet he yep . Everything we had on Strucker has been erased . Not everything . Known associates ... Well , Strucker had a lot of friends . Well , these people are all horrible . Wait . I know that guy . From back in the day . He operates off the African coast , black market arms . There are conventions , all right ? You meet people . I didn 't sell him anything . He was talking about finding something new , a game changer , it was all very " Ahab . " - This . - Uh , it 's a tattoo , I don 't think he had it ... No , those are tattoos , this is a brand . Oh , yeah . It 's a word in an African dialect meaning " thief . " In a much less friendly way . What dialect ? Wakanada ... ? W - , Wa - ... Wakanda . If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods ... I thought your father said he got the last of it ? I don 't follow . What comes out of Wakanda ? The strongest metal on earth . Where is this guy now ? ( African language ) Don 't tell me your mad swing [ ? ] will do , I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts . Now , you will make it right , or the next missile I send you will come very much faster . Now , minister , where were we ? ( African language ) Shut up , shut up ! Yeah . The enhanced . Strucker 's prize pupils . Want a candy ? Oh , sorry to hear about Strucker . But then , he knew what kind of world he was helping create . Human life . Not a growth market . You ... you didn 't know ? Is this your first time ? Intimidating someone ? I 'm afraid that I 'm not that afraid . Everybody 's afraid of something . Cuttlefish . Deep sea fish . They make lights . Disco lights , " whoom ! whoom ! whoom ! " to hypnotize their prey , then they " whoom ! " I saw a documentary , it was terrifying . So if you 're going to fiddle with my brain , and make me see a giant cuttlefish , then I know you don 't do business , and I know you 're not in charge , and I only deal with the man in charge . There is no " man " in charge . Let 's talk business . Upon this rock I will build my church . Vibranium . You know , it came at great personal cost . It 's worth billions . Now , so are you . It 's all under your ... " dummy holdings ? " Finances , so weird . Well I always say , " keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and wait to find out which is which . " Stark . What ? Tony Stark used to say that . To me . You 're one of his ? What ? ! I 'm not ... ! I 'm not . You think I 'm one of Stark 's puppets , his hollow men ? I mean look at me , do I look like Iron Man ? Stark is ... I 'm sorry . I 'm s ... oooh . I 'm sure that 's gonna be okay , I 'm sorry . It 's just , I don 't understand . Don 't compare me with Stark ! It 's a thing with me . Stark is , he 's a sickness ! Ahh , Junior . You 're gonna break your old man 's heart . If I have to . - You don 't have to break anything . - Clearly you 've never made an omelet . He beat me by one second . Ah , this is funny , Mr. Stark . It 's what , comfortable ? - Like old times ? - This was never my life . You two can still walk away from this . Oh we will . I know you 've suffered . Blah ! Heh , heh , Captain America . God 's righteous man , pretending you could live without a war . I can 't physically throw up in my mouth , but ... If you believe in peace , then let us keep it . I think you 're confusing peace with quiet . Yuh-huh . What 's the Vibranium for ? I 'm glad you asked that , because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan ... ! - Shoot them ! - Which ones ? - All of them ! - Move , move , move ! Huh ! Ah ! Oh ! Stay down , kid ! It 's time for some mind games . Guys ? Is this a Code Green ? ( garbled feedback ) Thor ! Status ? The girl tried to warp my mind . Take special care , I doubt a human could keep her at bay . Fortunately , I am mighty . This is going very well . I 've done the whole mind control thing . Not a fan . Yeah , you better run . Who 's ever standing , we gotta move ! Guys ? Again . - You 'll break them . - Only the breakable ones . You are made of marble . We 'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony . What if I fail ? You never fail . Are you ready for our dance ? Is it him ? Is that the first son of Odin ? Heimdall , your eyes ! ? Oh , they see everything . They see you leading us to Hel . Wake up ! The war 's over , Steve . We can go home ! Imagine it ! - I can still save you . - We are all dead . Can you not see ? You 're a destroyer , Odinson . See where your power leads . Sloppy . Pretending to fail . The ceremony is necessary , for you to take your place in the world . - I have no place in the world . - Exactly . - What can I do ? - Ah , it hurts . - I 'm gonna kill him . I 'll be right back . - No . I 'm over it . I want ... I want to finish the plan . I want the big one . Ah ! The Vibranium 's getting away . And you 're not going anywhere . Of course not . I 'm already there . You 'll catch on . But first , you might need to catch Dr. Banner . News or footage , keyword : Hulk . Natasha , I could really use a lullaby . Well , that 's not gonna happen . Not for a while . The whole team is down . You got no back up here . I 'm calling in VERONICA . All units , all units ... - Need backup ! - Whoa ! Need backup ! You tell ' em ! Aah ! Run ! Run ! Raaar ! Get back ! Go ! Okay , move in , move in ! All right everybody , stand down ! You listening ? That little witch is messing with your mind . You 're stronger than her , you 're smarter than her , you 're Bruce Banner . Raaaar ! Right , right , right , don 't mention puny Banner . Okay . In the back ? Dick move , Banner . VERONICA , gimme a hand . Go to sleep , go to sleep , go to sleep ! Okay , pal , we 're gonna get you out of town . No , not that way , not that way ! C 'mon ! Bruce , you gotta work with me ! Everybody out ! Going to get ugly ! I 'm sorry . - Damage report . - ( bzzzt ) . - It 's comprehensive . Show me something . How quickly can we buy this building ? Go , move , move , move , move ! Raar ! Raaaar ! The news is loving you guys . Nobody else is . There 's been no official call for Banner 's arrest , but it 's in the air . Stark Relief Foundation ? Already on the scene . - How 's the team ? - Everyone 's ... we took a hit . - We 'll shake it off . - Well for now I 'd stay in stealth mode . And stay away from here . So , run and hide ? Until we can find Ultron , I don 't have a lot else to offer . Neither do we . Hey , you wanna switch out ? No , I 'm good . If you wanna get some kip , now 's a good time , ' cause there 's still a few hours out . A few hours from ... where ? A safehouse . - What is this place ? - A safehouse . Let 's hope . Honey . I 'm home . Hi . - Company . Sorry didn 't call ahead . - Hey . This is an agent of some kind . Gentleman , this is Laura . I know all your names . Oooh , incoming . - Ah ! - Dad ! - I see her ! Hey buddy ! How you guys doing ? Ooh ... - These are ... smaller agents . - ... look at your face ! - Oh my goodness ! - Did you bring Auntie Nat ? Why don 't you hug her and find out ? - Sorry for barging in on you . - Yeah , we woulda called ahead , but we were busy having no idea that you existed . Yeah , well Fury helped me set this up when I joined . He kept it off SHIELD 's files , I 'd like to keep it that way . - I figure it 's a good place to lay low . - Honey . I really missed you . How 's little Natasha , huh ? She is Nathaniel . Traitor . ( chatter ) - Somebody 's getting bigger , huh ? - Somebody 's getting excited to have a new ... ( chatter continues ) Thor . I saw something in that dream . I need answers . I won 't find them here . We can go home . See you worried for nothing . Can 't even feel the difference , can you ? If they 're sleeping here , some of them are gonna have to double up . Heh heh heh . Yeah , that 's not gonna sell . What about Nat , and Dr. Banner ? How long has that been going on ? Has what ? Ha ha ha ! You are so cute . Nat and ... and Banner ? I 'll explain when you 're older . " Hawkeye . " Oh . Okay . It 's bad , right ? Nat seems really shaken . Ultron has these allies , these uh , kids , they 're punks really . They carry a big damn stick . Nat took a serious hit . Someone 's gonna have to teach ' em some manners . That someone being you . You know I totally support your Avenging . I couldn 't be prouder . But I see those guys , those ... " gods , " You don 't think they need me . I think they do . Which is a lot scarier . They 're a mess . Yeah . I guess they 're my mess . You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back . Things are changing for us . In a few months time , you and me are gonna be outnumbered . I need ... Just be sure . Yes , ma 'am . I can feel the difference . ( speaking Korean ) Scream , and your entire staff dies . I could 've killed you , Helen , the night we met . I didn 't . Do you expect a thank you note ? I expect you to know why . The cradle . " This is the next thing , Tony . " This ... is the next me . The regeneration cradle prints tissue , it can 't build a living body . It can . You can . You lacked the materials . You 're a brilliant woman , Helen . But we all have room to improve . Oh . I didn 't realize you were waiting . I would 've joined you , but uh , it didn 't seem like the right time . They used up all the hot water . I should 've joined you . Missed our window . Did we ? The world just saw the Hulk . The real Hulk , for the first time . You know I have to leave . But you assume that I have to stay ? I had this , um , dream . The kind that seems normal at the time . - But when you wake ... - What did you dream ? That I was an Avenger . That I was anything more than the assassin they made me . I think you 're being harder on yourself . Here I was hoping that was your job . What are you doing ? I 'm running with it . With you . If running 's the plan , as far as you want . Are you out of your mind ? I mean , understand that I 'm ... Natasha . Where can I go ? Where in the world am I not a threat ? You 're not a threat to me . You sure ? Even if I didn 't just ... there 's no future with me . I can 't ever ... I can 't have this , kids , do the math , I physically can 't . Neither can I. In the Red Room , where I was trained , where I was raised , um , they have a graduation ceremony . They sterilize you . It 's efficient . One less thing to worry about . The one thing that might matter more than a mission . Makes everything easier . Even killing . You still think you 're the only monster on the team ? What , so we disappear ? Thor didn 't say where he was going for answers ? Sometimes my teammates don 't tell me things . I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception . Yeah . Give him time . We don 't know what the Maximoff kid showed him . " Earth 's Mightiest Heroes . " Pulled us apart like cotton candy . Seems like you walked away all right . Is that a problem ? I don 't trust a guy without a dark side . Call me old fashioned . Well let 's just say you haven 't seen it yet . You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart , right ? Well I guess you 'd know . Whether you tell us is a bit of a question . - Banner and I were doing research . - That would affect the team . That would end the team . Isn 't that the mission ? Isn 't that the " why we fight , " so we can end the fight , so we get to go home ? Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts , innocent people die . Every time . I 'm sorry . Mr. Stark , uh , Clint said you wouldn 't mind , but , our tractor doesn 't seem to want to start at all . - I thought maybe you might ... - Yeah , I 'll give it a kick . Don 't take from my pile . Hello , dear . Tell me everything . What ails you ? Do me a favor . Try not to bring it to life . Ah , Mrs. Barton , you little minx . I get it , Maria Hill called you right ? Was she ever not working for you ? Artificial Intelligence . - You never

 Previously on The Handmaid 's Tale ... Being in here is a privilege . Time to go . I 'm sorry . Can I stay here with you ? Please ? You want to stay ? Kiss me . Like you mean it . I can 't be here . I can 't be here . If they find us here . If they find us together , I 'm gonna get sent to The Colonies . You 're an Eye . You 're untouchable . Offred . Don 't call me that ! My name . It 's June . Luke . Do you know a woman named June Osborn ? Yes , my wife . This is for you . I love you so much . Luke is alive . I stretch out my arms to him , but he slips away . Like a ghost at daybreak . And I am left here . I wish this story were different . I wish it showed me in a better light . In a different story , So I 've gone back to Nick . Time after time , on my own . I want to know him , memorize him , so I can live on the image later . I should have done that with Luke because he 's fading . Day by day and night by night he recedes . And I become more faithless . I could say these are acts of rebellion , a " fuck you " to the patriarchy , but those are excuses . I 'm here because it feels good and because I don 't want to be alone . June . You were at the dealership for ... A month ? Five weeks . I called in a favor to get you that . Yeah , it wasn 't a good fit . Lot of bad fits . Two months at Walmart , three weeks ' construction . You know how this looks ? Like I can 't hold a job . Okay . Honestly , I don 't know what else I could do for you . The economy , you know . Come on , man . We 're waiting here . I 'll take anything . What about retail ? Ann Arbor ? Hey , loser . You heard the man , time to give up . Fuck you ! Hey ! Hey , guys , come on ! Guys ! That 's enough ! You ! Get out ! Jesus Christ . Shit . Easy , easy . You okay ? You gonna sue me or something ? No . Let me buy you a cup of coffee . So , what happened when the steelworks closed ? I tried to find something else . Joshua just gave up . He 's my brother , Joshua . What 'd he do ? Uh , he scammed a few months ' disability , Idle hands are the devil 's workshop , as the Good Book says . Yeah ... You know it 's not actually in the Bible , right ? No , it 's not . But there is a verse about idleness making the house fall apart . Sounds about right . He takes off a lot . Disappears . Weeks , sometimes . It 's hard . You 're a good soul , Nick , helping him . Taking time out for family , it makes it hard to work a schedule . Bosses don 't like that . Mmm . I mean , we all have our stuff , right ? So , what are you going to do now ? I 'll find something . It 's hard making it in a society that only cares about profit and pleasure . No wonder God has turned His back on us . No wonder there are no children . He doesn 't want them to grow up in this Who can blame Him ? There 's nothing you can do about it . Now , there you 're wrong . There 's this group that wants to set things right , clean up this country . We have chapters in 30 states . I head up one of them . We 're called the Sons of Jacob . Come with me to a meeting . I think you 'll like what you hear . Who knows , maybe there 's a job in it for you . You 're not alone , Nick . Hi . How 's my fair little one this evening ? Fine , thank you . Up for some excitement ? I thought maybe we could do something different tonight . Monopoly ? No guessing . Now , first , we 're gonna have to do something about those legs . Once a month , Rita waits outside while I shave my legs in the tub . We 're not to be trusted with razors , not for longer than necessary , for obvious reasons . This must be a special occasion . Hold still . Doesn 't that feel nice ? Yes . He 's good at this . He 's done it before . You 'll need this , too . You remember how ? I guess we 'll find out . Beautiful . What is that ? I hope it all fits . I had to guess the size . You look stunning . But just one thing . What is this all for ? Tonight , I 'm taking you out . Shall we ? You have her pass , too ? Yes , sir . Mrs. Waterford went to visit her mother . She won 't be back until tomorrow . Where are we going ? You don 't want me to spoil the surprise , do you ? All along there , you can see the improvements we 've made . We took down the tenements , put up a park . The whole grid 's solar now . It 's amazing . Coming to the checkpoint , sir . Pull up your hood , Mrs. Waterford . It 's okay , you 're with me . Hold . ID ? Evening . Evening . How are you ? Commander Waterford . Mrs. Waterford . Have a good night , sir . Clear . Let ' em go . Let ' em through . You 're very quiet . Aren 't you enjoying yourself ? I was just ... It 's so beautiful at night . I don 't usually get to see it like this . Ah , but tonight you aren 't you . Sir , we 're almost at the river . I 'm gonna have to ask you to get down . Past the gateway , wives aren 't even allowed . Women aren 't allowed . We must be crossing the Charles into Boston . Or what used to be Boston . All clear , sir . Under His eye . Under His eye . I 've never been out this far . Not since before the Red Center . It 's all clear . There now , was that scary ? A little exciting though , too , right ? There is much more excitement to come . Can 't wait . We must treat these girls respectfully , in a Godly fashion , despite the moral stain from their lives before . Pryce , ease up . We can 't afford all that window dressing . The human race is at risk . What is important is efficiency . So , what do you propose ? It 's not rocket science . All remaining fertile women should be collected and impregnated . By those of superior status , of course . You 're talking about concubines . I don 't care what you want to call it . The wives will never accept it . No , we won 't succeed without their support . You know that . Maybe the wife should be there for the act . It would be less of a violation . There is Scriptural precedent . " Act " may not be the best name from a branding perspective . The " Ceremony " ? Sounds good . Nice and Godly . The wives would eat that shit up . Commander Pryce , Commander Guthrie . This is you . We 'll bring this to the Committee , then , after lunch . Run it up the flagpole . This is all very promising . Sorry . Guthrie 's a great field commander . He took New York . He has God in his heart , even if his mouth is sometimes a bit blasphemous . Hadn 't noticed , sir . What 's your opinion about all this ? About the Handmaid issue . I think you 're right , sir . It 's better not to form attachments . Better for whom ? Everybody . What 's your name , son ? Nick Blaine , sir . Pleasure to meet you . This is the back entrance . Can 't exactly use the front door . You 're contraband . Sir . Let 's take this off . Almost forgot . There . Doesn 't she look beautiful ? Yes , sir . This way . Here we are . Don 't gawk . You 'll give yourself away . Try to act natural . It 's like walking in the past , don 't you think ? I thought these kinds of places were forbidden . Mmm , officially . Unofficially ? Oh , we turn a blind eye . Everyone 's human , after all . Now , let 's get you a drink . One won 't hurt . It wouldn 't look right if you didn 't . What 'll it be ? Hmm ... Manhattan , please . Mmm , sophisticated . Manhattan and a Scotch , neat . Give us another round here . Who are all these people ? Oh , officers , senior officials . And foreign visitors , of course , to stimulate diplomacy and business . I meant the women . Hey , sweetheart . What can I get you ? Oh . All women who couldn 't assimilate . Some were working girls before . That one there , she 's a sociology professor . Or she was . We 've got lawyers , a CEO , a few journalists . I 'm told you can have quite a good conversation with some of them if what you feel like is talking . We 've got quite a collection . They prefer it here . Where 's the ladies ' room ? Just round the corner . Will you excuse me ? I 'm so sorry I left you at the train ! That 's okay , it 's okay . I didn 't ... I didn 't know what else ... I know , I know , I know . I know . It 's okay . Okay ? It 's okay . I know . Oh , my God , Janine ... Janine said you were dead . And you believed that crazy bitch ? God , I can 't believe you 're here . What 'd you do wrong , laugh at his dick ? It 's just temporary . The Commander smuggled me in for the night . Some of them do that . It 's just another shitty power trip . Hey . You were just here . You know the rules . Get back out on the floor . Find me later . In the dorm . Mezzanine level . Okay . And fix your face , girl . You 're a mess . There 's brandy , Scotch , vodka ... It 's good stuff , too . Courtesy of our Russian visitors . You got hair dye . Their wives do like their illegal chemicals . Speaking of ... It 's all here . Um ... Oxy , Percocet , speed , pregnancy tests . What 's the ketamine for ? Some of the guests have Sleeping Beauty fantasies . But the girls use it , too . They 'll spike the guys ' drinks , go through their phone after they pass out . The Eyes thank you for your service . Are you okay ? Yeah . Oh . Ah , thank you . Yeah , it 's from the mistress ' garden . It 's fresh . Stick around , I 'll make you that pesto that got me a James Beard nomination . Another time . Okay . Not tonight . Okay . Pleasure doing business with you . All sorted ? Hello , there . I haven 't seen you before . Davidson . She 's with me . An evening rental . Of course , sir . Excuse me . Outstanding work with the Mexico delegation . Thought I 'd lost you . Here I am . No ! Help ! Please ! Help , please ! Please , don 't ! No . No . No . No . No . No . Please . What did you think was going to happen ? He 's that way with Pryce too . Goes where the wind blows . I can 't trust him . We 've been hearing things from other districts . Purges . Could just be rumors , I don 't know . No one 's made a move yet here , but I can 't help feeling there 's a target on my back . Well , I suppose that 's what happens when you 're the boss . You do understand me , don 't you ? So ... What do you think of our little club ? Why did you bring me here ? I thought you 'd enjoy it . I thought we could just be , together . Do you like that ? Yes . You don 't need to be quiet . Yeah . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh , yeah . All right . Let 's ... Yeah . I told you . Yeah . Yeah . So annoying , though . Ow . Oh , godawful . You look like the Whore of Babylon . What , isn 't that the point ? Take a hike , will ya ? Did you pick this out ? Government issue . Why , isn 't it me ? Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm great . What about you ? How 's Waterford ? Forget him . I just want to hear about you . Tell me everything . I took the train into Boston , like we planned . I remembered a safe house . Quaker family . They about lost their shit when they saw an Aunt at the front door . I got lucky . They knew someone in the Underground . What 's the Underground ? Femaleroad . Cute , right ? They 're smuggling Handmaids out of the country . Trying to , anyway . I didn 't get that far . Office park outside the city . They shot the guy who helped me . What happened ? Never found out . Not like it matters anyway . God , Aunt Lydia must have ... She must have shit a brick when you got back to the Red Center . They didn 't take me back . I was a " corrupting influence . " They took me somewhere else . After they finished their questions , they gave me a choice , The Colonies or Jezebel 's . It 's a few good years before your pussy wears out . All the booze and drugs you want . Food 's good . We only work nights . I mean , it 's not so bad . We 're gonna find a way to get you out of here , okay ? June , I know the way out . Black van , feet first . That 's it . Look , forget about escaping . This is Gilead . No one gets out . Luke got out ! Yeah . Thank God . But he isn 't us , and he isn 't in here . We 're alone , June . Just take care of yourself . You need to go . Come here . Come here . I love you , okay ? Me , too . So fucking much . Don 't worry . We 'll get you home before you turn into a pumpkin . Commander Guthrie 's been sleeping with his last two Handmaids , according to his Martha . His aide tells me he 's skimming from the transportation budget . Excellent . All of that should be simple enough to verify . The uniformed corps of the Eyes is our most visible face . But our best intelligence comes from our plainclothes operatives . Anything I can do to help , Commander Pryce . You do understand that , as an Eye , you 'll chiefly be reporting on the activities of your own Commander , Fred Waterford . Yes , sir . A sad business , the loss in your household , the Handmaid . I only hope Commander Waterford has better sense when the new one arrives . Well , no one 's above the law , Commander . We are going to clean up Gilead , son . You 're back . Yes . So , how is she ? The same . How were things here ? Oh ... Lonely . Nick , would you grab my bags ? They 're out the back , please . Of course , Mrs. Waterford . She home ? Yup . Nick . I 'll see you later ? Nick ? We can 't do this anymore . Nick . You know I had to go with him last night , right ? You know I didn 't have a choice . I don 't have any choice . Why ? You 're gonna talk to me ? Talk to me . Talk ... Talk to me , Nick . I don 't know anything about you , you know . Nick , you won 't tell me anything . So , I don 't know anything . I don 't know who you are . Jesus , Nick . Fuck , is this it ? Is this it ? Is this enough for you , this bullshit life ? Is this what you want ? You want to polish his car and once in a while just try to get a Handmaid pregnant ? Is that enough for you ? We 're being stupid . You know we 're being stupid . It 's too dangerous . No , it isn 't . You could end up on the wall . But at least ... At least someone will remember me . In this place ... At least someone will care when I 'm gone . That 's something . That is something . Hey . Wait . Wait , wait , wait . Hey , hey . What ? My name is Nick Blaine . I 'm from Michigan . Well , under His eye , Guardian Blaine . Offred . Welcome home , Mrs. Waterford . Thank you . I brought you something . I had it in my bedroom , growing up , as a child . I thought you might like it . There 's a key . Thank you . The perfect gift . A girl trapped in a box . She only dances when someone else opens the lid , when someone else winds her up . If this is a story I 'm telling , I must be telling it to someone . There 's always someone , even when there is no one . I will not be that girl in the box .

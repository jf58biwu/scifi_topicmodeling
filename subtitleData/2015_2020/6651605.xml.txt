I 'm instructing you ... Shit ! Go . Good job , Charlie Bronson . Bravo 2-0 . Lights up . Play video . Dawn of twilight ... a cyborgs era . Thank you , sir .

You know , Jimmy , there is something about spine snapping That never gets old . - It sounds like ... - The end , the beginning . Or all there 's same ? Have a seat , Henry . When a man cripples , there 's always one question in everyone 's mind , Especially in his , " Does his dick works ? " Mine didn 't , so I plotted my escape from this chair . I come to Russia when in the West banned resuscitation of dead tissue . Akan is a megalomaniac , but my research was funded . I kept my eyes on the Nobel Prize . Who has time for ethics when he 's rich and his cock works , eh ? I paid a high price . I stopped making soldiers and then I succeeded . I grew men made of cyber-flesh . Mainly , just fancy-pants prostheses .. But don 't dare to tell ... My avatars ! Now , cyborgs on the other hand have bits and a brain . They think for themselves , in at least . Do you wanna take a look ? That hippie , always with the ganja . You 're not baked , right ? I hope not . Alright . You are the man , Henry . There is very little actual man left , of course . Enhanced skeletal muscular systems , cardiovascular turbo booster with a curio 244 atomic battery . A good night 's sleep and you can power an aircraft carrier . Remarkable technology , is it not ? Not you . My boys . I made the first few for revenge . but then started exploring new aspects of myself . Can I have a sip ? I have lived these past years , Henry . My lads , they get speeding tickets , they walk barefoot through the grass . And boy , do they get light ? You never guess what we do here sometimes alone . Hit " play " , over there . Go . What did you do ? Close your eyes . Close your eyes . Something is wrong with you , mate . Do not worry , not gonorrhea or anything . I just gotta sit you down in this chair ... and try to look at you , yeah ? The scanner says you 're in terrible danger . I 've beating shit for being a traitor , you lying grosser . I 'm shutting you down , mate . Put down the proto baby . Now ! I 'll try to unplug you nicely , even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan . No ? What 's this ? What 's that ? You 're broadcasting to Akan ! Enough ! Enough . Even if I did believe you , you still have to ... Henry , no ! No ! You brought them to my lab ! I trusted you ! Henry . Henry , please , kill me please . Akan won 't . He 'll make me live in this straitjacket and rotten , smelly skin . What the fuck was I thinking ? That Akan 's toy robot was my friend ? Thank you , Henry . Fuck you too , but mostly thanks . My lab is compromised , but I can build a new one using Akan 's equipment ... When we go get your wife . Together . Right ? Put that on the wall . If Akan had my lab no one will . Now , don 't loose this . Fuck you Akan . Don 't change your channel . We 're coming right over . Alright , I counted six vehicles . That 's at least 35 men . We gotta cut them down to half of that before they enter the hotel ... to give us a fighting chance to get out alive . There 's a certain stigma , attached to blokes who ... music ... . I just wanna get outta there , right now . I 'm a macho man . Got it ? Here they come . Wait for it . Wait for it . Now . Alright , cover me . Yeah ! Fuck , they 're in the hotel . We don 't need the sniper anymore either . Go inside , see the colonel . Over here , lady . Arm yourself to the teeth . Don 't touch that . Emma Gee is mine . As my father used to say , " A Grenade a day , keeps the enemy away . " Come on . Faster . Big Sally . Well , home is where the battle is . Alright , Private , it is our duty to ensure that nothing happens to invalid , understand ? Follow on . You can hear them but you can 't shoot them . You can probably grenade them . Throw them an egg down there , lady . Forward ! Come on . My Lord , how embarrassing . Dodged a bullet . I 'll cover you . You go around them . Don 't let the cripple get to know you , lady ! Jolly , good . Pull your weight . Help me with the cripple . Ready to get five paces back on my command . Ready ? A cripple home for a crippled man . Thank you , Yuri . My quarters are actually up there . - Would you like to see them ? - Oh , we will . Indeed . Don 't spare the horses . Take the next slipway . Over here . Here you go . Turn off the engines , lady . It turn the tables on ... . Turn off the engines , lady . It turn the tables on ... . ? . Big Ben . Akan is a cock ! Oh , my . Looks like Akan 's already begun . By tomorrow , these poor chaps , will be super , robotic soldiers like yourself . Look out ! What 's red and bad for your teeth ? On your feet , lad . On your left . I 'm gonna buy you some time . Seal the door . I can 't tell the number of times I dreamt that I was riding up in this lift . It is a pity that can 't ... It 's just a landing gear , ladie . Now , listen to me . When you kill Akan , I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him ... is just as dead as they are , understand ? Now , I 'm afraid I shall not be coming with you . But you , letting me get you this far , has given an old sweat his greatest gift ... in all his years . No . It 's lodged and it 's jugular . If not be able to retire ... The ... The thing in your pocket , quickly . I 've a confession to make . You see , I 've been surveying Akan for years . So when you drop down onto that roadway and you revealed so splendidly , Well , I saw it as my shot at revenge . You gave me reason with Dimitry , but then in the forest ... well , I noticed an implant . A memory block , you see ? And I couldn 't afford , to have you remember a better life somewhere else , so ... I left it in there . It 's not finest hour , I 'm afraid . But then , back in my lab , while I was trying to analyze what you could do for me . I realized who you are to me , Henry . It 's bloody nice having a friend , Henry . And you think all those deaths I would have prepared for this . If you haven 't ... , you 'll start to remember bits of your past now , Henry . And those memories ... They 're real . Like you . Trust them . Memories , memories , memories . My first batch of cyber-soldiers . With everything that you 've experienced today ... uploaded into what 's left of their brains . All they remember is waking up in the lab ... with their wives screwing their legs on . I love you Charlie . I love you , Edward . I love you , Thomas . You recognize this ? No ? That 's odd . They 're your wife 's . I smell what you like about her . This one 's almost ready for you . But I 'm warning you , their boosters will seem to you have now ... Look like a fucking toy battery . Go ahead , and fuck him up . Get up . Get up ! Can you handle this , Henry ? Why are you hitting yourself , Henry ? Baby ? Baby , are you okay ? I love how protective you 've me . - You owe me an apology . - For ? Doubting me . - I did have certain apprehensions . - Why did you let me do it ? I was just detaining my women and losing all my men . Is everybody dead ? - Yes . - Yes . Do you know when I realized that this was working ? When ? When Henry pulled me into the escape pod , trying to get me out of the lab . No mater what . Who would have thought that this pussy is a hell of a motivator ? We 'll have a hundred of you tomorrow , and a thousand next week . Each one 's first memory will be his wife , Sliding a cheap ring finger bronze . Every single one of my soldiers , will wake willing to do any thing my brilliant wife tells him , Whether it 's marching in Paris or the White House lawn . I would like to pretend you understand the part you played . You didn 't make history , Henry . You helped end it . You ... little ... pussy . It 's like my old man told me . It 's like there 's my name . And I 'll prove them right ... by killing all the wrong people . I love you , Henry . And I 'll never call you anything but your name , but you gotta decide . Are you gonna lie there swallow that blood in your mouth ? Or you gonna stand up , spit it out , and go spill theirs ? - Akan ! - Fuck ... No ! Stop ! I 'm ordering you to stop ! Henry ! Stop ! Where it is ? No . Fuck you , motherfucker ! Fuck , you . How could you do this to me , Henry ? How could you fucking do this ? Answer me ! Answer me ! [ EASY ] Motherfucker ! What the hell happened , Henry ? You were supposed to love me . Henry ! Henry ! Listen to your heart ! Improved by msync

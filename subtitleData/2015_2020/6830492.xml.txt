 Previously on " Aftermath " ... What kind of wave would cause all this ? What is it made of ? Why is it here ? Whatever was in those computer cards that Gloria Douglas gave me , I bet you it has something to do with this wave . Sarah 's part of this family now . - I 'll be right back . - Matt ! Brianna , where are you going ? You by any chance that adept I been looking for ? Yeah . Well , then , let 's howl together , brother . We don 't got all day . And so we slouch to Tesla 's towering achievement , juice for a billion bulbs to light the night when mankind breathes his last gas . You always talk with that voice ? Well , I don 't like to . But , uh , people expect it sometimes . Josh . I can 't believe you were holed up here the whole time . Well , yeah . I wouldn 't say the whole time . Plus , it 's a big place , you know . Well , it 's nice you got us the gas to get us here , so ... Well , it won 't be much use after today . But you 're sure it 's today ? Oh , no , I 'm positive . You know , I have proof . I 'd like to see that . - Me too . - Yeah . - Ow . - Oh , watch your head . All good , baby . Now , hang on . Hang on a minute . I am digging your art installation . I was trying to relate some of the different phenomena ... With the disasters , paranormal . - You 're in there . - Oh , I 'm flattered . Is any of this gonna stop the Moon rocks from falling ? Nah . You gotta go with no . Okay , then . Why don 't we go with what you 've got inside , huh ? - Oh , sure . - Okay . Yeah , but you 're not gonna like it . No , figuring out when the debris would hit wasn 't the hard part with my background . Which is what ? I was an astrophysicist before things took a turn . What kind of turn ? Can 't say . Just know there was a problem , so I headed out into the Mojave to try to figure it out . - Uh-huh . - You know , next thing I knew , it was 12 years later and the wife had declared me dead . You know , I , uh , I liked it a lot . So , you know , I stayed . Kept writing the physics about what was coming , but no one would publish it . So I wound up overnights on the radio . Skinny heard me , and he brought me out here when it all started to blow . Hey , what kind of physics were you writing ? Oh , well , the only one that matters . String theory , you know , space and time . Plus I have the basic skills for telescopic observations . You have a scope here ? Yeah . Out back . Nothing serious . Just enough to watch the solar system go to shit . Anyway , uh , video feed 's in here . You said that you could predict when the debris hit . Oh , ninth grade math , man . Now , where it hits , on the other hand , that 's the fiesta . You know , given that the world is spinning at , you know , 1,037 miles and all . So it could miss us completely . Well , we got thousands of these things coming at us . You know , maybe tens of thousands . All different sizes . Yeah , but same velocities . Which makes it worse . Right ? 'Cause it 's gonna hit all over the globe all at the same time . How close to where we are ? Well , the local impact is in a six-state radius around this building . Six states is huge . That could be hundreds of miles away . Yeah , no , no , I wish it were . Let me show you something . This here is the feed from my scope . Right there . Yeah , you see , that one 's gonna land right on top of us . It 's about a mile across , moving ten miles a second . That makes a 12-mile crater , 100-mile blast zone . And there 's three more like that , same path to here . Hundreds more aimed at the Earth in general . So it doesn 't matter where in the six states . Anywhere is close enough to kill us all . Okay . How long to impact ? Oh , let 's see . Ten miles a second , maybe two hours , you know , and a bit . You know . Unless your dad and I can figure out a way to stop it , I 'd say we all have about two hours left to live . Drink ? [ ominous music ] You 're just being emotional . Oh-ho-ho ! Okay . So you chased a girl into the desert with no car and no plan , but I 'm being emotional . - That 's awesome , wow . - This isn 't the desert , and I have a plan . Okay , enlighten me , Matt . Okay , she either ran away or she was taken . Either way , she has to be on a road . This is the only road around for miles . So she 's been right by here . Or she 's hiding . Or God knows what else . She 's alive . I know . I 'm ... You know that 's not even her real hair color ? Like , she 's probably , like , mousy brown or something . So ? So I 'm just saying what else is she hiding ? Why don 't you like her ? You don 't like Devyn . I do now . It 's easy now , Matt . I needed it then . Okay . Okay , Matt ... Matt , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Don 't be . You 're right . [ scoffs ] God , you must be pissed at me . Furious . But you still followed me out here . 'Cause I love you , you idiot . Do I have to spell out everything for you ? No . I just like making you . [ panting ] What are you doing here ? I just left you . It 's a trade secret . Where you going ? What ? I gotta find my kids . They only have two hours , right ? I 'll give you a car . And all you gotta do is tell me everything you know about this . How 'd you get that ? I wasn 't gonna keep it . I just want to know where you got it . Because the only way to get one of those is to have a profound spiritual experience . [ woman laughing maniacally ] We didn 't kill her ! We didn 't kill anybody ! [ gunshots ] [ laughing maniacally ] I killed you ! I have something for you . Take it . Used to be a bullet . Now it 's a stone . So I had a spiritual experience . So what ? All I got was this stupid stone . Do you know it 's a key ? [ sighs ] - A key ? - Yeah . - Okay . - To the Omphalos . That 's a really ... That 's a good word . Greek word . The Omphalos is the navel of the world , the center of the universe . And that key could open it up . It 's the role of the righteous at the end of the world , or , you know , so some people would think . Hmm . Okay . [ laughing ] Um ... - Do I get the keys or ... - Sure . Yeah , the rides are out back . Keys are on the driver 's side front tire . Any one but the Fairlane . You should try the Delphi Cafe . It 's a little south of here . Delphi Cafe . Never know what you 'll find . Yeah . [ sighs ] Yeah . Thanks . Don 't mention it . Now I gotta go say good-bye . Okay , we need a car . All right . I 'd like a pony too . You know I always wanted a pony ? Hey , check it out . Help me . What , we gonna drive a bush ? A bush with wheels there , smart-ass . Oh , great . Next you 're gonna tell me that you 've got the keys , right ? Actually ... I do . Hold this . You know , Dana 's a lot nicer than you are . Yeah , well , she 's also a smart-ass in her own way . Ladies first . [ scoffs ] Get in the back . My people , my sheeple , we 've come to the end . This is the final frontier . You 've given me the opportunity to voice out all my lunacy , and I am grateful , campesinos . Even a prophet needs a crowd to wire him up and make him loud . So wherever you are , my lonely ones , my only ones , I hope your journey wrapped up tight into that good and final night . The Moon 's pouring down , and we gotta blow town . So good luck and Godspeed , John Glenn . Mom ? - Mom ! - Karen ! - Mom , wait ! - Karen ! What the hell ? There 's only two hours left . I know ; I gotta go find the kids . But we need you here . I understand . Give me an hour . If I don 't find them , I 'll come back . Fair ? [ sighs ] Fair . Fair . You have to stay here and figure out how to survive this . Have I ever lied to you ? No , not even when I wanted you to . Okay . I 'll see you soon . Bring them back . I will . Be careful . Come on . This is the last of it from the motor home . Great . This is what I call an art installation . Well , laugh if you want , but this is the best shot we got . Actually , our best shot would be a shuttle to Mars . Listen . You know what I 'm thinking ? Right in the middle of all this . " The one is many , but the many are one . " Yeah . All right . Why is that in the middle ? 'Cause everything leads to it . But why ? I thought you knew why . No , man . I don 't ... I have no clue , man . That 's why I need you . I just ... this just came into my head , flashed in my head , and I couldn 't get it out . Same here . I mean , I know it 's key to the whole thing and everything , and I knew there was someone out there who was gonna help me figure it out . When you said that I was an adept on the radio , I just understood that I was one . Yeah , which proves that it is you . You 're an adept . Was it ... why ? What is an adept ? Well , I think people like us , when we know something , man , we just know it , right ? Like the physics of it all and everything like that . I mean , are you hip to the trip of what is causing all this ? Well , I guessed gravity waves . There you go . Lady wins a little bear . Yes ! This whole region of space is getting hit by gravity waves . Ripples in space and time . How did you know ? Mm . I have no clue . But usually when I say something , it turns out to be right . Like Mount Rainier . There you go . Right ? See this whole side of the board ? This is the faith and myth side . Like these skinwalkers , Quetzalcoatls , End time prophecies coming true . Yeah , sure . But my thing is hard science . That 's the other side : science . Which is why I need you , man . You see , you swing that shit , man . I can 't . Yeah , well , here 's what I 'm thinking . The thing that 's causing this , whatever it is , we have to try to understand that it has both a physical side and spiritual side . But there has to be some kind of unifying principle that connects this with , you know , this and this , this ... Gloria Douglas . Right . Gloria Douglas . There 's a professor I knew , Gloria Douglas . She was able to predict a lot of this . You know , she said ... She said it just came to her . Another adept . Right , but she said it was all about waves , " waves . " She wasn 't a physicist , so she didn 't understand what kind of wave or why , but ... She single ? No , dead . [ laughs ] Dad , what about her computer cards ? Right . Yeah , we have them in the motor home . - Let 's go . - Yeah . I got these from her . But we have nothing to read them on . Here . Are you kidding me , man ? These are brilliant . But who knows what kind of machine it would take to read them ? A Docu-mation M-200 . Last made in 1979 . Oh , well , that 's not good . Oh , don 't harsh the buzz . I happen to own one . That 's impossible . Bought it off a guy in 1981 . I don 't know why , but I kept it ever since . You know , all 222 pounds of it . Okay , well , let 's ... Let 's go run the cards . Moondog . Yeah , a little problem there . My compadre 's holding it for me . - He 's got half my shit . - Is he nearby ? He 's a few miles down the track . You know , I can get on the blower . - What , the phone ? - Phones don 't work . CB radios , some of the community have . Battery operated , so they still go . Hey , you know what ? Also last made in ' 79 , same as your card reader . All right , let 's go . Let 's do it . Let 's mash up the motor and see if we can scare up the mud duck . - What does that mean ? - I don 't actually know . But I suspect it 's relevant - ' cause ... two hours . - Okay . Okay . [ engine roaring ] No , I 'm not doing that . Just do it , for god 's sake . Why ? Why would I pull over ? Because I need to pee . What do you mean you have to pee ? That 's not something with unclear meaning . It 'll take 20 seconds . Okay , well , I 've shared a bathroom with you and I 've seen you take 20 minutes . Plus we could die any second . We 're not gonna die this second . Okay , just pull over . My God . Goddamn it , Matt ! - Right there . - Okay ! Okay . Just pull over . Okay . Okay , great . Go , go , go , go , go . And stop . Hurry up . I 'm not waiting for you ! I 'll leave you behind ! Look away ! I 'm not watching you ! God ! This is gonna go a lot faster if I know you 're not looking . Okay ! [ sighs ] Hey ! Yeah , so I , uh , I got good news ; I got bad news . I 'll take the good news . Well , my buddy 's got it . Guy called The Junkman . I 'm guessing he 's also the bad news . Well , here 's the thing . The Junkman and I , we 're solid . He leads the league in old-time electronics . Helped me build my studio . Got me this really sweet vintage ribbon Mic ... Bob ! Bob , what 's the bad news ? Oh , the bad news is . Yeah , uh ... Yeah , he says he 's gonna kill you . So why does The Junkman want to kill my father ? Maybe ' cause Skinny Jardin is dead . - What ? - Oh , that guy you met here . He was killed by that federale . I know who Skinny Jardin is , but why ... The Junkman says that Skinny would still be alive if he hadn 't met you . So he 's holding you responsible . - That 's ridiculous . - Well , you gotta ... You gotta admit , you 're in the chain . Well , will he let you do the cards ? No . No , no , no , no . He said he 'd kill me too because I 'd be working for you . You coming ? To meet the man who wants to kill my father ? Yeah . Hour 50 left . Nothing better to do . [ grunts ] All right , Junkman . Here we come . Are you done ? Matt ! Matt ! Oh , goddamn it . Matt ? Matt ! Matt ! Oh , what now ? Skinwalkers ? Wormholes ? Any of the other bullshit ways to die ? Matt ! Matt ! Shit . Matt ! If I find you and you 're not dead , I 'm gonna be pissed off ! You 're saying that gravity waves are responsible for all this physical stuff ? Well , they ring the Earth like a bell , baby . That accounts for earthquakes , tidal waves , volcanoes ... Is there any chance that the waves affect time too ? Oh , sure . They push and pull it all around . So I 'm not a physicist , but I believe that many in your community are beginning to accept the possibility at least of a multi-dimensional universe . Oh , that 's a olden Goldie . String theory says 11 dimensions . Wow . So the gravity waves could also be breaking down the barriers between the 11 dimensions ? That 's exactly what they do . They compress ' em . They force ' em into one another . That would explain why we 're seeing these ... these ancient demon gods . They 're real . They 're just not real in our home dimension . Right . Until now . So all this stuff ... The meteors , skinwalkers , they 're just all different aspects of one truth . The one is many ... both : But the many are one . - Brother man ! - That 's a total breakthrough . This is incredible . Except we all die in , what ? - An hour 40 ? - Give or take . No , the answer is in this box . [ engine rumbling ] [ engine dies ] Oh , for God 's sake . [ engine grinding ] Come on . [ engine clicking ] [ sighs ] Son of a bitch . Hello ? Did you kill my engine ? No . You want some coffee ? Look , I was told to come here ; my engine stalled . You think that 's a coincidence ? Think what you like . I don 't have time . I have to find three kids . Two girls , late teens . One red , one blonde . A boy a little bit older . Sorry . I 'm out of time . This is urgent . Everything 's urgent today . [ sighs ] Thanks anyway . You 've got a key . Yeah . I was already told that today . It fits in the Omphalos , the navel to the world , our attachment to creation . Good to know . It will cast away shadows and bring light . Will it help me find my kids ? It tells you anything you need to know the most . Like where they are ? Whatever you need . Okay . Where is it ? Right there . [ panting ] Matt ! Where are you ? Matt ! Oh , shit . Matt ! Matt ! Bree ? What are you doing here ? Looking for you , idiot . Where have you been ? Sarah ran off . I had to go with her . It was my fault . I just freaked . I killed my friend a few days ago , and when I had to kill those people today , it was just ... too much . So we ran off . You ... you took off from where ? You were driving with me . No , I wasn 't . He 's been with me the whole time . We were running away , but ... Matt should be with you and your family . So you were never with me at all ? No . What 's wrong with you ? Nothing . Oh , nothing . How about you ? Do you have a car ? Yeah , uh , just up the road . Great . You drive . Well , um ... It 's either that or ... we all die out here . Lead the way . Yeah , okay . [ woman cheers ] [ raucous chatter and fiddle music ] Break it up . [ all cheering ] [ fiddle music continues ] Nothing like mass extinction to kick-start a party .

Yeah , and we know there 's contact points between dimensions everywhere . The wormholes . You mean the tiny black hole kind of " wormhole " ? Yes , like the kind that sucked up all the people in Seattle and dozens of other cities . Millions of people ... Being pulled into other dimensions . Yeah , man , I get that .

The Tesla Tower drew it out , didn 't it ? Yeah , like it was magnetically attracted or something . Well , you know , Tesla figured out how to get power from the atmosphere . That tower attracts electromagnetic energy of all kinds . And the wormholes pump energy like crazy . We have to turn it on . We have to leave it on . And they 'll get pulled here . Assuming we can find a wormhole ; if we got one in range . All right , so we drag a wormhole over the tower . It sucks the Moon shit into another dimension . And nobody dies . If the wormhole gets here before the rocks . Right , which are on their way at ten miles a second . Moondog , how 's it coming with the line boosters ? Almost done , brother , but you got company . Car coming in from out of the woods . It 's Mom . She found them . - You made it . - Yeah . Told you I would . We 're using the Tesla tower - to attract the wormholes . - What ? It 's gonna take a whole hell of a lot of power . But Moondog 's gonna have to crank it to max . I wired up two line boosters in parallel . - You think it 'll work ? - Oh , yeah . Or the whole building will blow up . So , you know , 50 / 50 . Welcome back . How was Delphi ? Interesting . It always is . Yeah . Guys , look . [ Karen shuddering ] Oh , God . Uh ...

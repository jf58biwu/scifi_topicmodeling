 My brother was murdered here . It was Ezequiel . I called you here to give you something . It 's just a little precaution . If you get caught , take this poison so you can 't rat anyone out . Use it only as a last resort . Candidates , dinner will be served soon . We 'll be waiting for you in the hall . A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES CHAPTER 07 CAPSULE Hi , Michele . Welcome . - Hi . - Make yourself at home . Today , you can relax . We know the Process can be quite stressful . Yeah . But I 'm relaxed . - Doesn 't look like it . - What ? Don 't listen to him . - You took so long . I need to talk to you . - Hi , Fernando . Can we talk later ? But it 's very important . I 'm gonna grab a drink . We 'll talk later . - But , Michele , I need to talk to you now . - I can 't now . - Good evening , Ezequiel . - Good evening . Would you like some ? To us . I really admire you . I 'm so happy to have made it through . Congratulations . Enjoy . Thank you . Hello . Congratulations on another year , Mathias . Congratulations on the Process . I didn 't do much . You should thank the other agents . Come on ... You ... You deserve it . We create many varieties there not available in the Inland . The food is good , isn 't it ? But the question everyone 's asking is : What about dinner ? Is it gonna happen tonight ? Are you sure ? Hello , how are you ? - You really are an idiot . - What ? Changing the subject ... what is sex like on the Offshore ? What do you mean ? Sex is sex . I know , but do you get married , stay with just one person , or is it more liberal ? You 'll find out soon enough , Joana . Can 't you give us a hint ? So I know what to expect . Well , I think I 'm gonna go now . No , stay right there . Hey , Michele , what do you think ? About what ? She 's not listening . Attention , please . Good evening . I 'd like to ask my dear candidates to come a little closer . The dinner we are about to serve is a celebration feast . Now , you can consider yourselves actual people . The chosen three percent ! Congrats ! Fuck , yeah ! This year , like all others , wasn 't easy . But I 'll remember it forever . Tomorrow , you will go through the Purification ritual ... and then you can head to the Offshore . Well , I 'm sure you can 't wait for me to stop talking , so I 'll stop talking . So , let us toast and celebrate the three percent ! What 's happening ? - Don 't touch him ! - What 's going on ? What is it ? Quickly ! For God 's sake , what 's happening ? You 'll stay here until further notice . César may have felt sick , but Dr. Gisele will take good care of him . Did he have any health problems ? No . His exams were good . He was in excellent health . Is this a normal occurrence ? Of course not . " Normal " ? Michele , stop right there . I saw what you did . You spilled booze all over the table . This liquor is a rarity . What a waste . I saw everything . But relax . These bottles are really hard to open . I tried to pour a drink and made a mess , too . Guys , this booze is strong . - Rafael 's already drunk . - Maybe I am . But it 's at times like these that I remember my training . I trained with an uncle who drank so much . He drank and drank and drank . But ... he never fell down . That 's what matters most , Michele . To never fall down . - Another glass , and you 'll keel over . - Check it out . - Take it easy . - Before I forget ... What are you gonna do ? It 's over , anyway . Fernando knows about us . What ? Don 't worry . Process romances don 't last on the Offshore . Everybody knows . - Right . - You 've said so . Not true , Daniel . He ... knows about our bond . I had to tell him . So , you should talk to him . Poor guy . I don 't want him to be against us . Against you . Cheers . This wasn 't a stroke . I ran a blood test ... and it tested positive for batrachotoxin . - What ? - What ? What do you mean ? Why would anyone want to poison César ? What if he wasn 't the target ? The hall doesn 't have as many cameras as I 'd like . - What ? That 's absurd . - It doesn 't ! I checked , and the substance is the same one the Cause uses . - Are you sure ? - We don 't have it on the Offshore . - Someone from the Cause is here ? - Is the prisoner from the Cause conscious ? Yes . - See if he says anything . - Okay . - Shit ! - How did this poison get here ? How are you still holding someone from the Cause ? Aline , César is dead . I need to work . I need to be alone . - Okay ? - Okay . Go ahead and work , but work really hard to fix this shit , because if this ruins your reputation , your recommendation will count for nothing . - Get to it . - Go . Shit . I 'm impressed this thing lasted so long . My dad had to fix it almost every day . We have much better options on the Offshore . And depending on the treatment , you might not even need it . Bernardo , I need to ... - May I ? - Sure . Go for it . There are many other candidates ... I want to talk to . - How about now ? - What do you mean ? Can we talk ? Is everything okay ? - Rafael-- - I know . I know . He told me this afternoon . You are both with- - Fernando , shut up . Don 't worry , I won 't tell anyone . You don 't know what you 're getting into . I 've thought about it all day . I don 't care anymore . I don 't care about anything anymore . I don 't care about the Process , about the Offshore . I don 't have a home . I have nothing left , Michele . - Fernando , you don 't know me- - - You 're all I have . It sounds ridiculous , I know . I 'm not ... I 'm not asking for anything in return . You don 't have to say anything . Just listen . You don 't know what 's going on . You don 't know . Attention , candidates : You must remain inside the hall until further notice . Remain inside the hall . Remain inside the hall . - Attention , candidates ... - Do you know what 's going on ? ... inside the hall until further notice . What 's going on ? We 've been getting alerts- - Yes , the situation is very serious . Does he ... have any chance ? Unfortunately , no . - Who 's responsible for this ? - Most likely some bastard from the Cause , but don 't worry , I know how to handle this . But I 'm going to need your help . I 'll check in with you later , okay ? Come with me . Hold my hand . Get rid of this for me . Why me ? They 're watching . I 'd fuck it all up . Every candidate will be questioned . When you hear your name , head to that ramp . What 's going on ? Candidate Daniel , you 're first . Unbelievable . The Process is crumbling before our eyes . Ezequiel 's position is becoming unsustainable . Yes , but he will be able to handle this . - Aline , are you okay ? - I 'm fine . This is a huge opportunity for us . I know . It 's just that seeing César 's body- - But that 's exactly why we need to take Ezequiel out . If I was still the Process leader , this would have never happened . I know , I know . I 'll start working on the report . Thank you , Matheus . All the candidates locked in one place ? This reminds me of something . - I don 't think so . - Why not ? Even the agents seemed worried . They 're good at pretending . Trust me . Attention : Candidate Victor is next . Go to the bottom of the ramp for questioning . How did it go ? Just some weird questions . About ? Poison . The guy who got sick was poisoned ? I don 't think so . They just wanna see how we 're going to react . How we react to an agent 's murder ? Why ? To see what theories we come up with . What does that prove ? - Who has the best imagination ? - What 's your explanation ? An infiltrator from the Cause . - This is the safest place there is . - Well ... I don 't know what happened , but ... they could at least give us dinner . Good one , Rafael . Go ask . I 'll wait here . - Uh ... - Go ahead . Is this what you were talking about ? - Is it- - ? - You don 't need to know . You wouldn 't understand . It 's better this way . Did you interact with Agent César ? Not much . So , you didn 't know what he thought about your performance ? That it was a little below the curve ? - The guy really died ? - Yes , Joana . He died . So , this guy who died didn 't appreciate my style ? - That 's right . - Really ? And you couldn 't save him ? With all the technology of the Offshore ? My philosophy is simple : I 'll do anything to pass and nothing that will prevent me from passing . I don 't know who did this , but whoever it is ... is the stupidest person I know . Next candidate : Fernando . What do you know about the death of Agent César ? His murder . I don 't know anything . I mean ... I saw him fall , then Daniel walked up and said something ... How did this happen ? What do you know about poison ? Poison ? Nothing . What do you mean " nothing " ? - There was no rat poison where you lived ? - No , sir . Did you notice anything odd with any agents or candidates ? No . Did you notice any agent or candidate behaving differently ? More nervous than usual ? - You took too long to answer . - No . I was trying to remember if I saw anyone , but I didn 't . Fernando ... now is the time to be honest . - I understand- - - Better to say too much than too little . Do you know any candidates who seem uncertain about the Process ? If you omit anything now , you may be considered an accomplice in the future . Next is candidate Michele . Hi , Michele . Are you comfortable ? Just a little nervous . Want some water ? Is there anything you want to tell me ? - Anything at all ? - No . What time did you leave your room ? - About 7- - - At 7 : 19 . I saw the security camera footage . Did you go straight to the dining hall ? Yes . Try some . It tastes different . I like it bitter . What do you think ? - The drink ? - No , the Process . I 'm happy . I passed . There 's still the Purification ritual . Sure . You always knew you 'd get far , right , Michele ? I 've always had faith . I was surprised at the way you approached me tonight . The other candidates didn 't talk to you ? A few . But you are no ordinary candidate . No ? Not after that tragedy with one of the Cause members . Excuse me . - What 's this ? - It 's ... I was mugged a month ago . They took all I had . And I got stabbed . You know Inland medicine , it 's very basic . I had to stitch it up myself . And it bleeds sometimes- - Do you know how César was murdered ? - No , Daniel said- - - He was poisoned . As you can imagine , we 're wondering how a foreign substance got into the Process . At times like these , we can 't let anything slip through . I want to show you something . Where 's César ? Where ? Let me talk to him ! César ! César , no ! Why ? ! I want to know why . Why did you show me that ? So you can understand that César was one of us . A deserving and complete human being . A man who was loved . Who is now dead . I 'm going to ask you for the last time ... Are you hiding something from me ? Do you have anything to say ? I don 't know what you want me to say , what you want me to tell you , - but I have nothing to do- - - You can go . What ? I need to continue with the questionings . Go on . Oh , shit . Shit . Shit . I screwed up . Easy , easy . - I screwed up . - Easy . You were already interrogated and they let you go . It 's okay . No , it 's not . It 's not okay . Calm down . - Breathe . - It wasn 't supposed to happen , Fernando . Look at me , I 'm guilty . He died . They should arrest me . Look at me . Look at me . That 's it ... - Let me go ! - Take a deep breath . You don 't know me . Breathe ... Relax your muscles . One at a time . That 's it . I had to learn that because of the pain I get . Look at me , Michele . You can 't turn yourself in . If you go , I 'll go , too . I lied for you in there . We 're in this together now . You should have stayed away from me . Where are you going ? It 's unacceptable . A murder in your Process , under your watch . This homicide was perpetrated by the Cause . Unfortunately , it 's not that uncommon . This investigation has to be quick . We cannot let this get out of hand . That 's why I called this meeting . The investigation has been closed . - Have you found the culprit ? - We found her . She 's being arrested as we speak . - Aline ? - What 's going on ? You 're under arrest for the murder of César Franco , Process agent . Are you crazy ? Let me go ! Let me go ! Cássia . Candidates , you may return to your rooms . Everything 's been resolved . You can sleep in peace . The culprit was found and we 've already taken action . Michele , it 's over . - Everything will be okay . - But the culprit- - It doesn 't matter . It 's over . We 're gonna be together . - Is this a joke ? - Don 't try anything stupid . Let me go ! You know he 's making a huge mistake . Our investigation has led to Aline . Aline is not a murderer . There 's no way . You know that very well , Ezequiel . I know this must be difficult for you , Matheus . After all , she 's here on your orders . Not that I blame you for César 's death , but it must be quite a weight on your conscience . Enough ! Do you have any proof ? Why would Aline want to kill César ? Aline didn 't want to kill César . Aline wanted to kill me . It was probably at this moment that she tried to poison me . This is a farce . The autopsy revealed the poison used to kill César - is a substance used only by the Cause . - Exactly . Someone from the Cause infiltrated your Process . Actually , someone from the Cause infiltrated your Process , years ago . Aline is a member of the Cause , embedded in our society for years . That 's a lie ! I was her target because I 'm the Process Leader who ruthlessly hunts down revolutionary criminals . - That 's a lie . - I 'm still waiting for proof . We recently captured a high-ranking member of the Cause . You can decide for yourselves . Is that her ? It 's her . Aline . She 's one of our bravest revolutionaries . I met her when she was only a teenager . Our leadership trusted her blindly . She infiltrated the Process ... more than ten years ago . What was her goal ? She had to lay low . Little by little , she would gain people 's trust ... move up the hierarchy , until she had the opportunity to help the Cause from the inside . Those were her instructions . Councilors , I 'm not a judge . You can draw your own conclusions . I want to hear what Aline has to say . As you please . We can hear you now . Do you have anything to say ? I do . What I have to say is this : This whole story was invented by Ezequiel . He 's afraid because I have proof of a crime he committed . I 'm sending you a file that contains proof of the illegal activities conducted by the Process Leader . I confess I was waiting for a better moment to send this material . But this should be enough not only to charge him , but also to send him to the Recovery Center . PROCESSING - 100 % Aline , this is the report you sent me yesterday . We already read it . It 's only compliments for Ezequiel . No . Absolutely not . What I sent you was proof that he meets a boy in the Inland . That 's what I sent you . He takes care of a boy in the Inland . This man is perpetuating a lie . I didn 't kill anyone- - You will be sent to the Offshore . You will be detained until you have a fair trial ... and the whole truth has been revealed . I 'm at the Council 's full disposal . I didn 't kill anyone ... Thank you . You 're going to keep your promise , right ? Talk to me . Aren 't you ? I did what you asked . Come back . Finish this ! Kill me ! Kill me . I 'm tired . Hello , Michele .

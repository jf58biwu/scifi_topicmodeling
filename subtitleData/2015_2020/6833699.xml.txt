 You asked me for proof that Harry Clayton is crooked . I have CCTV footage of him gambling at my casino the night my father was killed . What did he want ? A package for the boss . What did you do with the money you won at the Green Dragon casino ? I burnt it . Why are we meeting here ? I found an expert . I see you 've noticed the symbols . It 's just like yours . Look at the dragons . It 's definitely the same ming yun bracelet . You shove a British policeman under a bus , and there are consequences . You let me take care of it . I 'll tell you what , Kaleem ... If Harry Clayton comes sniffing around , you tell him nothing . My employer thanks you . This is my mother 's murder case file . You were one of the detectives on it . Can we put our hands together for the deputy-mayor , Karl Frierson ? I want you to come in for questioning . It 's in connection with the murder of Luke Bangura . That 's enough ! Sorry , Karl , there 's been a misunderstanding . He is rotten ! For the last 3 years , I 've been tracking a man called Golding . I 'm certain ... he ordered my mother 's death . The murder of Maria Alexandri ... Harry was right . The Alexandri case could have been solved . Babs ? Original air date : 2016 , March 11 Sub by mielb Yeah , alright . Fine . This is my last bet . Let 's make it 100 for the second . Nice knowing you too , Seamus . What have I missed ? - You 're sure you 're with us now ? - Yes . Female , IC1 , fatal gunshot wound . Any witnesses ? A neighbour heard the shot but was too scared to investigate . But she remembers a boyfriend coming round earlier in the night . Loud music and furniture banging just before . Domestic gone horribly wrong ? Most likely except the weapon is very unusual . In what way ? It 's an antique flintlock pistol . My guess is it 's Napoleonic . Very rare . Excuse me . What 's the matter ? It 's my brother 's girlfriend ! Is that ... weapon from Richard 's shop , Harry ? I 'm gonna find him . Rich ? Your guys are there already ? Yeah . - I didn 't do anything , Harry . - I know . Listen to me . This is really important . You need to tell me exactly what happened . Some guy ... came round for dinner . Hum ... Duncan ... Duncan Ortiz . He 'd been in ... contact with Babs . He said he got something he wanted to show her . She was really excited . Some Tang dynasty dragon or something ... Then what ? Then I woke up ... and I was holding the flintlock like ... - Babs was dead . - That 's alright . You tell them just what you told me , word for word . It 's gonna be OK . So how did Harry react ? It 's his brother 's girlfriend , so ... This is gonna be difficult for him . How about you ? Sir ? Well ... Orwell 's gonna run it , but I 'd still like you to be the second on this . Oh ? But I understand if you feel too close to it . And because of your ... your connection with Harry . No . It 's OK . I 'll do it . You 'll be OK . - I 'll see you in a few hours . - Right . I 'll take it from here , Harry . - Harry , I ... - Come here . OK . OK , a few details and ... we 'll get you a strong coffee , yeah ? So , er ... Orwell 's working it . With D.S. Chohan . I 'm glad that 's someone I can trust . So am I. Harry , I 'm afraid you 're just gonna have to let them get on with it . Right . Do let them get on with it , Harry . We found this ... in Miss Haleton 's bedside drawer . What is it ? GHB . Liquid ecstasy . Has your fingerprints all over it . Can you explain that ? No . Carry on , Mr Clayton . What happened next ? You were drinking and then ? I remember the door bell ... ringing . Barbara went and answered it . Must have been Ortiz . What did he look like ? Tall . Tall ? That 's it ? That 's all I remember . I remember ... he and Babs talking about the Tang years stuff , and then they ... they looked in a book together . And you definitely don 't remember arguing with Miss Haleton ? No . We didn 't argue ! Well , you 're maintaining that you didn 't shoot Miss Haleton , so why run away from the scene as if ... you did ? I was pa ... panicked . I was terrified ! I went to find my brother . The pistol ... is a flintlock antique from your shop , isn 't it ? Yes . How did it get in Miss Haleton 's apartment , if you didn 't bring it with you ? I don 't know . It should have been in my lock-up . I rotate the stock if it isn 't selling , and the flintlocks had been sitting on the shelf for months . They come as a pair . Go to the lock-up . They must have been stolen . You ... you 'll find fingerprints ... or ... or something . Is that the ballistics report on Rich ? You 've read it already , haven 't you ? Oh , Harry ! The gunpowder residue found on Rich was clustered mostly around his right hand . I know how to read a ballistics report . Rich is left-handed . Someone must have ... put the gun in his hand and forced him to fire it . Or maybe he used both hands and his right hand took most of the residue . That 's unlikely ! You know being anywhere near this will compromise your brother 's case ! You won 't help him . You 'll hurt him . Suri , he 's left-handed . You understand the gunpowder residue matters so much more than what was clearly in his hand . You 're gonna just keep going round like that ? Suri , please . Chohan ! Give me some room , Harry , please ! - Harry 's bothering you ? - No . You think I don 't know he 's monitoring every detail of this ? It 's his brother . Suri , you 're a smart detective . You don 't need Harry Clayton doing your thinking for you . Now , look at this . This is the first time CCTV captures Richard Clayton , about 5 minutes from Haleton 's flat . Just give it a second . - He changed direction . - No . This is 10 minutes later . He went back for his jacket . Not so panicked after all , eh ? It 's not good , Harry . I can see that . What about the ballistics report ? Wouldn 't convince a jury . Suri 's right . Any gunpowder residue is enough . He needs something to back up his story , something conclusive to prove that this other person was there . Yeah , well , I don 't think that finding this other person is top of Orwell 's agenda . What ? You blame him ? Would you believe Rich if he wasn 't your brother ? That 's not helping . It 's how they 're thinking , Harry . It 's how the evidence is making them think . Good god almighty ! I 'm sorry . How is he coping ? He 's not . I 'd better get back . Ciao . What 's Rich meant to have done ? I can 't tell you that . This is where the Napoleonic guns are . They haven 't been checked out . Do you know if ... Rich had any ammunition for these guns ? What ? I don 't know . You knew the guns weren 't here ! Steve ! This is from the London Museum of Chinese History . Haleton was a consultant there . Well , there 's your motive . He stole this . She found out . He stopped her from telling anyone . You think Rich shot Babs ? No . Suri , Rich would never do anything like that . The question is just when we introduce this . And his testimony . What 's that ? I think you should follow Winter 's advice and leave this to us , Harry . It 's a Ming dynasty vase , stolen from the Museum of Chinese History , recovered from Rich 's lock-up . This is bollocks ! Suri , can I have 5 minutes , please ? - We 're busy ! Don 't be a bigger arsehole than you 're already are ! - Suri ? - 5 minutes . He 's being set up . Why ? I don 't know . Please ! What about this guy , Ortiz ? There 's only one Duncan Ortiz in the UK . He lives in Sunderland . He 's 84 years old ... and he 's just had hip surgery . Whoever is doing this to him wouldn 't use their real name anyway ! I have to look at the facts . There 's no forensic evidence anyone else was in that flat or handled that gun . You know Rich ! You spent time with him . He 's not even a thief , never mind a murderer ! Rich isn 't gonna murder someone over a freaking vase ! Yes , I did go back ... but to get my coat . My phone was in my coat . I needed to call Harry ! So you calmly went back into the scene of the crime to retrieve a phone ... and even then , you don 't call the police ? My brother is the police ! Ah ! Let go ! Go ! No ! Please ! Miss ! Miss ! Someone ... Someone knocked me down ! He stole my phone ! Could you describe him ? Yes . That 's right , I think I ... I hit my-my head ... quite hard when I ... close ... Oh shit ! I feel really stupid doing that to you . No worries . Mr Clayton , we 've got your prints on the murder weapon that came from your shop , ballistic evidence of you firing the gun , GHB in your blood stream , CCTV evidence of you returning CALMLY to the scene ... I wasn 't that calm ! I wasn 't in my right mind ! Surely , you can see that ! A Ming-era antiquity stolen from Miss Haleton 's work in your lock-up . None of which you can explain . I didn 't kill her , Suri . It 's not enough for you to say it , Mr Clayton . You 've given us nothing to make us believe you ! You have to believe me ! No , I don 't , Mr Clayton . I don 't know what happened with you and Barbara Haleton last night . Nor do I know what went through your mind the moments before you pulled that trigger . Or that the GHB you 'd both taken had pushed you into an altered state . Or if it 'd just enhanced the feelings of hatred you had for her already . No , no , no . That 's not true . I ... I loved her ! But ballistic evidence tells me you did pull that trigger and I don 't think you 're even denying that , - have you ? - I don 't know what happened ! Listen , an early confession will help , Rich . It can significantly affect the back-end of your sentence . Gonna give you some time to think about it . You were excellent in there . He 's gonna crack by tonight . Harry . Check page 89 for prints . Will do . After you , darling . We 've actually just managed to place a former inmate at a ... 2 Michelin-star restaurant . Not bad for a works canteen , eh ? There 's something I should tell you . I had an ulterior motive for agreeing to be a mentor here . Well , I was rather hoping you 'd say that . I 'm serious . Kevin Grey . I need to know what happened to him . And ? What you 've found out ? Another prisoner gave me a name . And the name they gave you ... was Golding , yes ? I 've heard that name too . I 'm not stupid , Anna . You don 't usher in one of the best bloody lawyers into your prison when they 've just lost a client in there without expecting they will ask some questions . You know how proud I am of the work we 're doing here . But White Cross is still White Cross . There are serious problems here , just like in every other prison in the country . But you can 't expect me just to let it rest . Of course not . I just don 't want you to feel that you 're alone in this . I want to find out who Golding is just as much as you do . Great , that 's great . Thank you . Good . So ... what 's Daisy up to this evening ? She 's at a sleepover . So why don 't you come over ? Hello ? OK . I 'll have a look . Thanks . - - - I know who 's behind all this . Charles Collins . Golding . What can you tell me about them ? Who ? My brother is going to jail for a murder he has nothing to do with . Give me something on Collins . I know you don 't wanna see my brother hurt . I don 't know who you mean , honestly . Hello Kaleem . Clayton knows your name . How do you know that ? Just stopped me in the street . And you thought the best course of action would be to call my private number directly afterwards ? No , no , no . He 's gone . Sir , this line is completely secure . Goodbye Kaleem . Shit ! Hold on . I 'll be a minute . Harry ! I think they 're gonna charge me . Do you recognize this man ? Sir , you can 't talk to him . - That 's him . - Who ? Ortiz ! That 's Duncan Ortiz . OK . Hang in there . Alright ? I 'm gonna get you out of here . Everyone says I should confess . - Don 't confess . You 're innocent . - Sir , please ! - Whatever you do ... - What the hell ... is going on here ? Pete , get him in there ! - Alright . - Say nothing , alright ? - Suri , we have to ... - How could you do this ? I found the man who did this to Rich and Babs . I just needed Rich to confirm it . He has . This is him . What are you talking about ? Look at him . Do you recognize him ? This is the guy that was working for Sasha Terekhova , the yacht , remember ? Charles Collins . He 's ex-military , ex-MI6 . He now owns a private security firm . He killed Babs and framed Rich . How did you figure this out ? Did Rich , in the interview , mention anything about looking at an ... an art book when Ortiz was at Babs ' flat ? Yes , of course he did . Charles Collins print 's on page 89 , it 's got a picture of a jade dragon on it . He 's in the system . ABH , 10 years ago , suspended sentence . And where did you find this book ? At the crime scene . Suri ... He 's my brother . I 've no choice but to do everything I can to ... No , you do have a choice . You 're just too far gone to make it ! I don 't care ! It 's him . I know it . It 's the truth . The truth ? Jesus , Harry , you haven 't told me the truth for months now ! Everything you do these days breaks down any procedure - I 'm supposed to work on . - Rich is innocent ! Look at the amount of evidence against him ! Charles Collins is capable of arranging all that . CPS have just approved our case . Richard 's gonna be charged in the morning . What ? You would have charged him too if you were still the cop I started with . Well ... We all change . Sir ! Excuse me , sir . Excuse me . - Police ! Out of the way ! - Sir ! Sir ! - Police ! Look ! Look ! - Sorry . I think we 've got rather interesting solutions for you . Well , I bloody hope so . The Minister of State is absolutely losing her mind . Mr Collins , Mr Under-Secretary , happy to meet you . Personally , I 'm finding it a bit sad that you 're farming work out to mercenaries . Charles ! Oh , hum ... Combat zone ... protective security , that 's it , eh ? I 'm so sorry , David . Could you give us just a moment ? Yes , of course , sir . I 'll ... see you in the Commons . 5 minutes honestly . Robert . Well , well , well ! This is a step up from guarding oligarch brats , isn 't it , Mr Collins ? Or is it Golding ? I 'm confused . You know there 's no need to follow me around . You could just make an appointment . I tend not to make appointments . It sort of ruins the surprise . - What 's the surprise ? - Barbara Haleton 's murder . See , I believe someone 's already been charged with that , haven 't they ? How would you know that ? Because information is how I make my living . Oh , so the killing , that 's just a hobby then ? Why are you here , Harry ? I have proof that places you at the scene of Ms Haleton 's murder . I 'm gonna bring you in for it . Really ? Why haven 't you done it already ? Is it because you 're a rogue police officer with no remit on this ? And if you arrest me , your superior will almost certainly suspend you ? Or have I got that wrong ? It 's just a matter of time . But how much time ? See , your brother is already in White Cross prison . And I believe that can be a very dangerous place indeed . I know who you are . I know what you really want . My brother has nothing to do with this . Leave him out of it . We should talk , but ... not here . Where then ? After my meeting with the Under-Secretary , let 's meet at the Dome . Just you and I. Say , 7 tonight , at the Dome ? It 's a date . What 's this ? Something I should have given you a while ago . It 's about Harry . So Harry wins 2 maximums in a row at Lau 's casino . Yes . What are the odds on that ? 1225 to 1 . So it 's fixed . He says it wasn 't . And all this on the night Lau died . Harry was there . What are you gonna do , sir ? Nothing yet . But it does prove what I 've suspected all along . Harry 's connected to Lau 's criminal network and it is clearly some sort of payoff . But if we are going to arrest Harry , we 're gonna need something more concrete . Something that shows how deep Harry goes into all this . I know what Kaleem looks like . Him . That 's right . Why ? Loose lips sink ships . And Kaleem 's lips are very loose indeed . But ... Do you like him ? I 'm afraid there 's not much room in our business for sentiment , Lily-Anne . Kaleem has to go . And we need you to prove your loyalty by taking care of this yourself . You wanted a seat at the big boys ' table , and we made that happen . I 'll say this much for your father , God rest his soul , he had balls . The future 's arrived , Lily-Anne . Maybe you 're a part of it or you 're not . Sir , London is under siege . And I know who 's behind it . A man called Golding . And who 's he ? It 's a pseudo name used by Charles Collins . He 's an ex-soldier , ex-spook and he 's now running London as the ultimate black op . Why you 're telling me this now ? Because Collins , Golding , whatever you wanna call him , framed my brother for murder . And why would he do that ? Because he knows I 'm after him . And he wanted leverage over me . No , I ... I don 't follow . Anything can happen to Rich inside White Cross prison , the same as they did to Kevin Grey and I 'm not there to protect him . Ah , so you 're here to ask me to get your brother released . My brother is innocent ! I 'm here to ask you for a little time so I can put a case together against Collins . Your brother 's already been charged , Harry , - if I 'm gonna get him ... - Ask about Collins . This man is responsible for everything that is going wrong in our city and we can take him down ... together ! He wants me to meet him later . Cover me with a surveillance team . Listen to our conversation with parabolics . I can get him to talk . I can 't be involved in this . Why ? Because of Frierson ? Sir , Frierson is connected ! He 's on the board of Collins ' company . They 're not even hiding it . Karl Frierson is pressurizing you to stop a crime wave that he 's involved in ! This is an impossible situation , Harry ! If you want your brother to be released , then I need evidence and that evidence can not come from you ! Right ! Right . So help me convince Suri . She can find this . She just needs pointing in the right direction . I don 't rate your chances of convincing D.S. Chohan to do anything . However , despite all that , I 'm gonna discreetly look into Charles Collins . Thank you . Thank you . But I don 't think you 're gonna be around long enough to see it through . Eve ? I know who Golding is . I 'm gonna meet him at the Dome . - Hello ? - Harry ? Rich ? I 've been told to tell you that there 's a change of plans . What ? Collins will meet you on the other side of the river . Where ? Royal docks . You can take the cable car . OK . Don 't worry . Don 't do it ! Rich , I 'm OK . Rich ? Rich ? Eve . I 've got your message . Yeah . Change of plan . I 'm going to Royal docks . And you 're just gonna meet him . This is what he wants . He 's going to try and kill you . I have no choice . You 're walking right into his trap ! He 's got my brother . You can 't count on the bracelet to protect you , Harry . It doesn 't work like that . ( Like ) fish in a barrel . Eve ! Eve ! Come on ! Move ! Please ! Move ! Move ! Move ! - Get down ! Down ! Ahhh ! - - Hello ? - Mr Linton ? Yes ? It 's Detective Superintendent Winter . What can I do for you ? I 'm e-mailing you a photo I 'd like Dr Marghai to look at . I can arrange that . May I ask why ? I 'd like to know if he can identify this man as the person who forced him to operate on Luke Bangura . Get the murder charged down to manslaughter . I 'll be very happy to let the court know how much the police appreciate his ... cooperation and assistance . OK . Send it over . - Will do . Goodbye . - Bye . Charlie ? Hum . What time is it ? I 'm not gonna hurt you . Where 's Charlie ? But you need to do exactly what I say . - Hello ? Detective Superintendent Winter ? Speaking . I have some information about Detective Clayton that you might find interesting . Is that loaded ? No . But this is . Proper little armoury that you 've got upstairs ! Where 's Freya ? She 's fine . She 's just a bit tied up . Are those the overalls you wore when you killed Babs ? I bet they are . I bet those are her bloodstains . And I bet that somewhere in those fibres , along with plenty of your DNA , there 's the discharge gunpowder from when you put the pistol in my drugged brother 's wrong hand , put his finger right on the trigger and pulled . Where 's Eve ? You can 't hurt her , you know ? She 's the only person who can put the bracelet on you . No . No ? I 'm not who you think I am . I 'm merely a soldier ... following orders . Really ? I 'm not Golding . Who gave you the orders ? They were stupid . They should have known I 'd be protected . Pick up the bag . I 'm taking you in . There was a lad in my regiment . We called him " Danger Dave " . He was a ... mad little bastard from ... Derby , I think . The only guy we had in Sangin who could match the Afghans for sheer bloody guts . Rocket fire , bullets ... He couldn 't care less . He was too brave if anything . Time after time , he 'd pop up . He put his head where it shouldn 't be . And he was gone away with it . That 's the thing about ... 19 year olds , isn 't it ? When they think they 're immortal . And then , one day , when things got really nasty , he got his head blown off , just like that . So ... for me , personally , the way I see it , I don 't care what kind of jewellery you 've got . Everyone 's luck ... runs out ... in the end . Right . I just got off the phone with the magistrate . Based on what you gave me earlier , and an anonymous tip-off I 've received , we got a ticket to search Harry 's flat . You 're coming with us ? Of course ! Police ! Nobody moves ! Entrance 's clear . Kitchen 's clear . The bath 's clear , sir . Well , let 's start the search . Huh ! Sir !

 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . [ FIVE ] I 've got all your memories in my head , I know it . [ ONE ] I 'm Jace Corso . [ JACE ] No , I 'm Jace Corso . I promise I will not rest until I 've done everything I can to save you . [ WENDY ] I 'm programed with various recreational subroutines . Do you like fun ? [ THREE grunts ] Wait ! This runs counter to your programming . Fun remember ? [ REPORTER ] The search continues for Emperor lshida 's murderer purported to be his own son , Crown Prince lshida Ryo . We just ... murdered 10,000 innocent civilians . [ SIX ] You Draves ? Maybe . I 'm lookin ' for someone . Yeah ? Who ? [ SIX ] He 's the leader of the Procyon Insurrection . They call him The General . [ DRAVES chuckles ] What 's so funny ? He 's the most wanted man in the galaxy . What makes you think I know where he is ? Well , he 's been using Arrakis Sadr as his base , and since this is the closest station to that planet , it 's a good bet his supply line runs through here . And to keep below the radar , he has to be doing business with the local criminal element , and you 're it , no offense . And I hope you 're not offended if I tell you you 're insane . Do you know how many people he 's killed ? I 've got an interesting business proposition for him . You put me in touch with him and I 'll make it worth your while ; 10,000 bars transferred directly into your account . I can do better . Twelve thousand . You misunderstood me . I said I can do better . Whoa-ho-ho-ho ! What 's going on here ? Griffin Jones . Wanted for smuggling , piracy , murder . It 's quite the rap sheet . And a hell of a bounty to go with it . [ blows landing , grunting ] [ gun fires ] [ SIX groans weakly ] [ DRAVES grunts ] What part of " We need him alive " didn 't you understand ? Sorry , boss . [ ONE grunts , screams ] What are you doing ? [ ONE groans ] I was surprising you with a hug . Why ? I don 't know , I thought you 'd enjoy it ? Do I look like someone who enjoys surprise hugs ? In retrospect , no , not at all . [ TWO ] Let 's keep it professional , okay ? [ annoyed ] Okay . [ ONE ] How 's she doing ? The corrector nanites in her body are damn impressive . I 'd say she 's about 85 percent healed . So , close enough ? We gonna bring her online ? Not yet . She 'll be good to go by day 's end . But we 're 20 minutes out from the space station . We 're gonna shuttle in ? No , we 'll dock . Well , how 're we gonna dock without the Android ? I 'll take us in . Just giving everyone a heads-up . We 're about to dock . If you 're looking for a seat belt , you 're out of luck . Of course not . I was just ... adjusting my seat . [ keyboard clacking ] Here we go ... [ rumbling ] And we 're docked . Never doubted you . Uh-huh . [ TWO ] Okay , supply run . One , you 're on infirmary restock . You got your list ? Got it . [ TWO ] Four , seeds to keep hydroponics going . Five , you 've got- - Gack ... Connectors , adapters , and 3-12 sprockets . [ TWO ] That 's what I said . Three , you 've got juice . Make sure that , um ... Where the hell 's Three ? [ FIVE ] In his room . He says he 's not coming . I 'll get him . Give him some time . He 's had enough time . [ knocking ] Get lost . What 's the point of knocking if you 're just gonna come in anyway ? It 's polite . Are you coming ? Nah , I got stuff to do . Such as ? Cleaning my guns . Working out . Cleaning my guns . All right , well , we haven 't been off this ship in a few days . Who knows when we 'll get another chance . You have a good time . You need to move on . I 'm thinking " moving on " is what I 've been doing all my life . It 's time I stopped ... Consider the consequences ... Consequences imply that you were responsible . She was relying on me ... I failed her . She believed in you with good reason . You did everything you could . [ sighs ] We all owe you our lives . [ TWO ] Okay , same drill as last time . We 're docked under a false registration . Just remember : Don 't draw any unnecessary attention to yourselves . Yes , I speak from experience . Think he 'll come ? [ ONE ] In the interest of us actually getting some RR , I hope not . Oh , come on . You 're all thinking the same thing , I 'm just the only one with the guts to say it . All right ! There he is ! Bring it on . Let 's do this , boys ! Huh ? [ TWO ] Okay , what 's up first ? Shops , spa , food ? " [ FIVE ] Food ! - - [ THREE ] Spa ! Seriously , kidding . Food . All right , let 's get some grub . 'Ey , you guys go ahead . I 'll catch up with you . [ TWO ] Are you sure ? [ SIX ] Yeah . [ THREE ] All right , knock yourself out . [ FIVE ] What ? Aren 't you gonna go get something to eat ? No , I 'd rather hang with you . No . What I mean is , I just need some time to myself , okay ? But we 'll hang out later . Okay ... [ ONE muffled ] Garlic ? It 's not garlic ... Parsley ? [ TWO ] Yes . Onions , mushrooms- - No , no , no mushrooms . It 's nuts . What 's that flavor ? Nuts ! Mealworms . [ THREE ] When you say mealworms , is that one of those words that sounds like something , but means something completely different , like " firearms " or " anal-geesic " ? It 's pronounced " annal-jezik , " and mealworms are worms . Well , larvae . They 're protein-rich and a hell of a lot less expensive and easier to source than beef . Meh . [ ONE ] Excuse me , c-could I see a menu , please ? So you 're not gonna eat that ? Cheers . [ WOMAN ] Griffin Jones . Wanted for smuggling , piracy , murder . I had one of my boys run a face recog when you started asking around about me . Curious that way . Hands behind your back . [ blows landing , grunting ] [ DRAVES panting ] [ alarm sounds ] [ TECHNICIAN ] How do you feel ? Fine . Why don 't I remember what happened ? If your clone returned to its transfer pod , all new memories should 've been sent back and uploaded into your temporal lobe . Well , they weren 't . [ TECHNICIAN ] It seems your trip was terminated early . No biomass recycling was recorded . Your clone died . Does it say how ? Just that we lost vital signs at 21 : 34 hours which triggered your early wake up . Could 've been an accident or natural causes . What do you mean , natural causes ? Genetic conditions can be transferred to the clone ... No , it wasn 't that . Put me back in . [ TECHNICIAN ] Our policy states that Transfer Travelers have to wait 30 minutes between travels . I don 't have that kind of time . [ TECHNICIAN ] It 's a precautionary measure to guard against stress-induced complications . Come on . Sorry . Regulations . [ SIX ] Just- - Look , I get it . You 're a cog in a big machine . Keep your head down , put in your time , retire and hopefully you die before the savings run out . It 's a solid plan , but I gotta ask : Doesn 't it ever get to you ? I mean , haven 't you ever wanted to just once , stand up for yourself ? Stick it to the big faceless Corporation ? Break one of their stupid rules ? By letting you transfer 30 minutes early ? Uh ... For example . It 's your cerebral cortex . Thank you . [ cheering , glasses clinking ] Do you know when I decided that I liked you ? When I didn 't shoot you when you tried to steal the ship ? No . When you abandoned us on that mining planet . Yeah ? [ THREE ] Yeah . At first , I thought you 'd screwed us over , right ? And I thought , " Damn . I like this girl . " But then , when you came back and you saved our asses , I was like : " Damn . I really like this girl . " [ TWO giggles ] Yeah , you guys , I mean ... You guys are great , man ! I may not say it enough , but- - Or at all . Ever . But you guys- - [ ONE ] Hey ! [ THREE ] Hey , you ! Huh ? What 's wrong with you guys ? You 're leaving me hanging , Fiver . What do you mean ? We 'll you 're all ... getting along . It 's weird . Are you drunk ? Of course we 're drunk . - -Have a seat . - - [ ONE ] Hey , here . Have some- - eat . No . [ FOUR ] And drink something . What 's the matter ? It 's Six . He 's gone off the Station . [ TWO ] What ? [ ONE ] What ? What do you mean he 's not on the Station ? Where 'd he go ? Bastard stole our ship ! - - [ ONE ] Hey , hey , hey ! - - [ FIVE ] Hey , no ! The ship 's still here . And so is he , kind of . Hang on a sec . What , are you drunk ? Is he here , or is he not here ? He 's using Transfer Transit . Uh ... What 's Transfer Transit ? It 's state-of-the-art travel tech . You get into a " transfer pod " and input a destination . The pod sequences your DNA and maps your brain . Then , that information gets sent via subspace ... Anywhere across the galaxy where there 's a receiver pod ... [ FIVE ] ... where they create a clone of you , complete with your memories and personality . It 's like flesh and blood 3D-printing . Wow ... [ FIVE ] But the clone has a short life span- - a few days , maybe . It has to return to its transfer pod before that time so all the new memories and experiences can be sent back to you before you wake up . How the hell do you know all this ? I read the brochure . [ THREE ] Hang on . Just ... Just go back . What the hell 's Transfer Transit ? [ TWO ] Oh , no , stop . Six would never submit to a DNA scan . Not after what happened last time . It says all DNA profiles are kept strictly confidential . Yeah , they would have to be , otherwise they 'd lose a lot of business fast . Still , it 's risky . He must 've wanted to go somewhere pretty badly . Wherever he 's going , whatever he 's doing , it can 't be good for us . [ RECEPTIONIST ] You 're back . lam . What 'll it be this time ? Merchandise or more information ? Information . I came in here earlier . [ RECEPTIONIST ] Yeah ... And I needed help finding someone . And ... I gave you a name and sent you on your way . That name again ? What ? What was the name you gave me earlier ? Draves . Wanna write it down this time ? Nah , I 'm good , thanks . Sure . See you around . Not if I get it right this time . [ DRAVES ] Yeah ? Yeah , it 's me . He 's on his way down . Are you sure we should be going through his stuff ? Pretty sure , yeah . I-It 's not right , it 's an invasion of his privacy . [ THREE ] You didn 't have a problem invading my privacy when you stole my bullets . That was different . I thought you were dangerous . Look , I didn 't want to get him in trouble , I just thought it was weird that he was keeping something from us . That ... maybe he needed our help . [ THREE ] I knew it ! He 's been hoarding the green not-as-craptastic protein bars ! He said we were out ! I got stuck eating the blue ones . They taste fishy ! [ FOUR ] Hmmm . What 've you got ? [ keyboard keys clacking ] [ computer beeps ] Great . [ keyboard keys clacking ] Try " Six . " - - [ keyboard keys clacking ] - - [ computer beeps ] [ FOUR ] Uh-uh . Try " lying hoarder . " We can waste all day guessing . We have to find a way to bypass the password . No way . Look at it this way : you 'll be proving his innocence . - - [ FIVE sighs ] - - [ THREE ] Come on ... [ keyboard keys clacking ] He was researching a terrorist attack on some space station . A lot of people were killed . Breaking news . We have an update on the bombing of Station Hyadum 12 by the anti-corporate terrorist group calling itself The Procyon Insurrection . Over 10,000 lives were lost in the attack , and today , investigators released the following video . Security footage uploaded to the G.A. hub before the station 's destruction clearly shows one of the suspects believed to be responsible for the bombing . If you see this man , do not attempt to apprehend him , but call your nearest G.A. detachment immediately . And you thought I was dangerous . It was instinct . I 'm sorry . Well , your instincts are terrible . And nearly cost us a huge payday . I 'll be careful this time . I promise . Nice and simple , right ? We tell him we 're taking him to The General- - then we capture him , alive , torture him , and then we get him to give up his real location . What if he gets suspicious ? There 's no reason for him to be . His first clone took its memories with it . As far as he knows , we 're meeting him for the first time . You Draves ? Maybe . So what can I do for you ? [ blows landing , grunting ] [ gun shots ] bang , bang , bang [ DRAVES ] No , wait- - ! Whoa , whoa , take it easy . I had nothing to do with this , I 'm just the girlfriend . Like hell you are . You 're way outta his league . Besides , your nails don 't quite match your outfit . They 're nice and short , ideal for handling a gun . Last time I was here I missed something . Not sure what it was , but , this time I 'm not gonna take any chances . And that means shooting you before you can draw . Now , I need some information and a shuttle . [ FIVE ] I don 't believe it . He couldn 't have killed all those people . Why , because he 's nice to you ? You think that means anything ? Does seem a little hardcore . Even for one of us . It 's a mistake . It has to be . [ ONE ] What about Calchek ? He knows our histories , maybe we should call him . No , it 's too risky . If we start asking for information we should already know , he could get suspicious . And I-if he finds out about our memory loss , he could consider us damaged goods and end our arrangement . Or worse , make a move against us . [ ONE ] Other ideas ? [ FOUR ] We follow Six and find out for ourselves . That 's a damn good idea ! We just go hang out by his pod , wait for him to wake up , make him cough up some answers . [ FOUR ] I mean we use the transfer technology , and see what he 's up to . [ THREE ] There 's no way I 'm getting sealed up in one of those things , all gift-wrapped and helpless for the G.A. , no frickin ' way . I 'll do it . He did it for me . With the Android out of commission , we need you here , you 're our resident tech expert . I 'll go . You go with him . Hang on . He , uncharacteristically , makes a good point . You 're pretty damn vulnerable lying trapped , in one of those things . [ TWO ] Six respects you . If there 's any confrontation , you 'll be able to reason with him . You have to go . [ TECHNICIAN ] For the duration of your travel , your body will remain here in cryo-sleep . When your clone returns for biomass recycling at the end of the trip , its experiences and memories will be uploaded , transferred back , and reintegrated with your own . Is it safe ? [ TECHNICIAN ] Absolutely . It 's the safest way to travel . With your true body here , you 're never in any real danger . Your clone could travel into the center of a star , and you 'd be perfectly fine . The possibility of any critical complications is extremely remote . What do you mean by critical complications ? [ TECHNICIAN ] It 's barely worth mentioning . There have been a handful of incidents- - strokes , heart attacks , the occasional aneurysm , but a causal link back to the technology has never been established . Well , that doesn 't sound so- - Sold . Excellent . Let 's see when we 've got a slot available ... Uh , how about next- - How about right now . Right now ? Okay , let 's get you signed up . Are you a couple ? [ ONE ] No- - [ FOUR ] Is there a discount ? Ten percent . Well , then yes , we are a couple . Um . A-Also , a good friend of ours was in earlier today . Griffin Jones . We 'd like to meet up with him . Did he tell you where he was going ? Uh , no . Uh , well , he doesn 't know we 're meeting up with him . It 's a ... surprise . Yeah , it 's his birthday . Uh-huh ! Well , I can 't divulge information about other customers . It 's against company policy . Also , it 's definitely not his birthday . That 's one of the things you have to provide when you sign up . Let me ask you something . Haven 't you ever been tempted to just break the rules , and ... finally- - Get back at my big , faceless corporate bosses for making me feel so small and insignificant ? Uh ... Send Red Team to pick up the shipment . Sir , I 've detected an incoming shuttle headed our way . First squad , with me . Update us if you hear anything . Yes , sir . [ TECHNICIAN ] Okay , I 've entered your destination coordinates and you are all set . Just lie back and relax . [ ONE ] Hang on , what if there 's some kind of m-medical issue ? The system automatically monitors for signs of physical distress . At the first indication , you 'll be pulled right out . Okay . Good . Good . Wait ! W-What if t-there 's a fire ? In all station-related emergencies , my first priority is to awaken all travelers and get them to safety . Ready . Hang on , what if- - Wait , wait , hang on ! Hey , w- - Hey ! Wait-Wait ! H-Hey , s-s 'cuse me ? Excuse me ? Hello ? [ gun clicks ] [ MAN ] That 's far enough . You got some balls coming here . I 'm unarmed . I 'm here to see The General . Just so happens he 's waiting for you . You ready ? [ ONE ] Yeah . Let 's go find Six . [ ONE ] What the hell , man ? ! Who are you and where is he ? ! [ ONE ] What 're you talking about- - Oh , crap . [ ONE sighs ] [ FOUR ] Who are you ? It 's me , it 's One . You 're Four . The rest of the crew is back on the Raza . We just used the transfer tech to follow Six to this space station to find out what he 's up to . Three is an asshole . It is you . Yeah . A glitch in the transfer process ? Can 't be , this body was constructed on your DNA template , so- - This is my real body . This is what I look like . Really look like . I 'm sorry ... [ FIVE gasps ] You 're awake ! My system is 93 % restored , but my corrector nanites are more efficient while I 'm in sleep mode . Well , welcome back . [ THE ANDROID ] Thank you . Why are you sorry ? You got hurt because of me . I possess no pain receptors . [ FIVE ] I-l mean , you were damaged by that other android because I suggested that you apologize to her . I apologized because you presented a reasoned argument to do so . I had no choice but to respond accordingly . Of course you had a choice . [ THE ANDROID ] In fact , no . I 'm a logic-based entity . Therefore , I act and react in a purely logical manner . No , no you don 't . I 've seen you angry , sad , lonely , happy . You might not have pain receptors , but your feelings can get hurt . I 've seen it happen . You were jealous of Wendy . I was not jealous . Think of the impression that she made on you , when you saw her with us . Now that I think of it , I did experience a sensation that could be misconstrued as human resentment . [ FIVE ] No . That was jealousy . And you know what that means . My programming is flawed ... No , you have feelings . Congratulations . [ FOUR ] Hopefully this Draves fellow shows up . Look , I 'm sorry . I should 've just come clean sooner . True . I don 't know why I was posing as Jace Corso . I don 't remember . So whatever hidden agenda I might have had , it 's gone now , right ? [ ONE ] I know you can 't speak for anyone else , so I just wanna know where I stand with you . We cool ? At the moment , I think I 'm the least of your worries . [ gun clicks ] You wanted to talk to me ? We 're looking for someone . Seems a lot of people are doing that today . [ ONE ] Big guy , came through about an hour ago ? Last we heard , he was headed in your direction . Yeah , I know where your friend is . He 's no friend of ours . Then what business do you have with him ? Payback . Well , why didn 't you just say so ? [ THE GENERAL ] Hey , Griff . Good to see you again . So , what brings you back after all this time ? Unfinished business . Huh . Thought you were just tired of running . Must get really exhausting , always having to look over your shoulder ... Never too sure who you can trust . I imagine it 's hard making new friends when you have a reputation for killing the old ones . They weren 't my friends . They were your brothers in arms and they trusted you . And I trusted you when I flew that shuttle onto the station to take that G.A. cruiser . You manipulated me , made me complicit in mass murder . [ THE GENERAL ] You were a soldier . My soldier . And we were at war . And that station , that was a legitimate target . Over 10,000 lives were lost , including children . Hundreds die every day under corporate rule , and the Galactic Authority- - our protectors--they stand by and let it happen . There 's no such thing as a bloodless revolution . Y 'know , you were a good soldier , Griff . Determined . Relentless . The very qualities that now make you a threat . You 'll be dead before your friends arrive . Oh ! Apparently they 're on their way . [ THE GENERAL ] And my men , they are more than ready to welcome them . You keep checking the time . Are you waiting for something ? Son-of-a-bitch . [ THE GENERAL ] Well , Griff , timing ? Not really your strong suit ... [ grunting ] [ grunting , blows landing ] [ THE GENERAL ] What the hell was that ? ! [ SIX ] I figured this was a one-way trip , so I set my shuttle to go critical . Though it did take a bit longer than I thought . Timing not being my strong suit , right ? [ BOTH grunting ] [ THE GENERAL grunts , rasps ] [ SIX snarls ] [ SIX pants ] Are you kidding me ? What have you done ? He was a clone . I know . So am I. So shoot , don 't shoot . It 's not gonna make much of a difference in the long run . [ gun shots ] [ SIX ] How 'd you find me ? We asked around . Who 's your friend ? Long story ... [ TWO ] You lied to us . I didn 't so much lie as slightly delay telling the truth . Oh , really ? And when exactly were you planning to tell us that truth ? Honestly ? I don 't know . I was looking for the right opportunity , but when 's a good time to tell your friends you 're not who they thought you were ? Hell , you 're not who you thought you were . All I know is I assumed an identity to get onboard this ship . As to why , I have no idea . [ TWO ] Right after that incident with the real Jace Corso , you should have told us everything . Hiding the truth makes us vulnerable . If Corso had come back at us , we never would have seen him coming . [ ONE ] I know ... I didn 't think it through . Is there anything else you 'd like to tell us ? Now 's the time . [ Two ] And you ! You knew , and you kept it a secret . That 's just as bad . It 's not as bad . It was strictly for blackmail purposes . [ TWO ] We don 't keep secrets , and we don 't blackmail each other either . Fine . [ TWO ] And you . What reason do you have for putting us all at risk ? It was something I had to do alone . I didn 't want any of you talking me out of it , or ... screwing it up . That 's an apology ? No . It 's me being honest . That 's what you want , isn 't it ? What I want is for us to be able to trust each other . [ TWO ] Moving forward , no more lies , no more secrets . We have to have faith in each other if we 're going to survive . But despite everything that we 've been through , we just can 't seem to do it . Whoever wiped our memories , probably did it to make it harder for us to work together . Guess what ? It worked . [ TWO ] It all looks good . Are you sure ? No discernible abnormalities ? None that I can see . Why ? Are you worried about something ? You 're implying that I experience anxiety . What are you suggesting ? Nothing . Wow . Touchy ... Suggestive of hypersensitivity . All the diagnostics show normal . You 're fine . Which is more than I can say for the rest of the crew . What 's wrong with the rest of the crew ? The atmosphere on this ship , it 's bad . The atmosphere is optimal . It 's 78.084 % Nitrogen , 20.9476 % Oxygen , 0.- - Morale . I mean morale is bad . [ THE ANDROID ] Yes , that is suboptimal . We have to find a way to trust each other . I mean , if we can 't even do that , how can we possibly hope to survive ? [ THE ANDROID ] How indeed . You look like you wanna say something . If you honestly feel this way , why don 't you tell them ? Tell them what ? The truth . About yourself . [ FIVE ] Hey ! [ SIX ] Hey . [ FIVE ] How was your workout ? It was good . Hey . [ FIVE ] We 've got another 3 hours or so before they finish repairs on the ship and ... some of us were thinking of heading into the station and catch a movie . Do you wanna come ? No thanks . But it 's Star Wars 36 . Remastered in full VR . They say it 's a classic . Nah , I 'm good . Have fun though . But you said ... we would hang out later ... This is the Ishida Directorate . How may I help y- - You know who I am . I wish to speak with Hiro . One moment . Ryo ? [ FOUR ] Hello , brother . [ beep ] There was a dramatic development today in the investigation into the death of Catherine Moss , the wife of CoreLactic Industries ' new CEO , Derrick Moss . The Galactic Authority identified this man , Marcus Boone , as a suspect in the case . Boone is a career criminal already wanted on dozens of unrelated charges . He is considered armed and extremely dangerous .

 - Did you sleep with my husband ? - Your husband ? Get the fuck out of my car ! I was just at home and I thought I heard someone inside . - I saw someone riding off on a bike . - Did you get a plate ? RJ652 . - What 's that ? - My phone . I was filming you . I saw you coming out of the ground ! - Who was this bloke ? - His name was George . I loved him and he loved me . - This doesn 't belong to you . - It doesn 't belong to you , either . I know about what you 're doing with Noregard . Has she told you why you 're back ? I could consider treating you as an accomplice in the matter . That would definitely mean a stay in juvenile detention . I know things that you don 't know . And I 'm pretty sure that this doctor here knows more than she 's admitting . Where is Patrick Fitzgerald ? Where is Charlie Thompson ? Where is Kirstie Darrow ? What about Maria ? - Has something happened to Maria ? - Patrick Fitzgerald ... Run . Run , run , run , run , run ! Aarghh ! Paddy , don 't ! She 's not disintegrating . Only pallor mortis at this point . He broke her neck . Why ? Why would he do that ? He murdered Maria and he dumped her body in the boot of his police car . Argh ! Agh ! Agh ... - Paddy , what are you doing ? - Borrowing the cop 's notebook . I 'll take it from here . Argh ! I know you killed Maria . Won 't go back in . Vic , what do you know about the people at the cemetery ? Agh ... Vic , tell me ! - He 's delirious . - Agh ... It 's just a morphine mix . I need him to talk . Just gonna need you to remove your helmet . I 'm gonna need your name and address . Ma 'am ? My name is Kate Willis . I live at 48 Doveton Road , Yoorana . Hello , Chris . It 's an open fracture . It requires surgery . Or what ? Nerve injury , blood clot , loss of limb , possibly death . Well , we can 't take him to a hospital . I know that . But he 's dangerous . He could 've killed them all . Vic , the cop from Echuca , the man I know , is not a killer . Then who is he ? Well , right now he seems to be the only person who can tell me something about what 's going on . Unless you can . All I know is he 's a murderer . So what do we do , then ? Nothing . Nothing ? What , just let him die ? No . You 're gonna operate on him . What ? You 're surgically trained . You 're at the clinic . Even if I could , there 's no guarantee he wouldn 't get a major infection and die . Kate 's a nurse . She can help you . I 'll get her , you make a list . I don 't know what else to say . Can you do something for me , then ? Can you call Mum ? Yeah . - Hello ? - Uh ... Jo . Um ... Er , er ... is that Jo ? It 's Chris ... uh , Chris Rennox , from ... from Yoorana . Chris . Are you alright ? Sarah had that baby early ? No . Everything 's fine . I ... I was just thinking about Kate and I thought I 'd give you a bell . Oh , how lovely . How are you ? I 'm ... I 'm good . How 's ... how 's Paul ? Yeah , he 's good . He had that hernia a while ago and he claims he can still feel it , but he 's fine . And Shaun ? Uh ... he 's a bit unsettled but then that 's Shaun . He 's not working , and he split up with that Norwegian girl , Elke . - Oh , that 's a shame . - We were relieved , actually . I think we were terrified he 'd move to Oslo . I couldn 't bear the thought of losing him too . No , I shouldn 't say that . That 's not the same as losing Kate . You were so good to her , Chris . And to James . A real friend . She was special . Oh , it 's so good to chat . Paul 's not here , but I 'll fill him in . It 's coming up to her birthday . It 's always a hard time for us . She 's still here . I know she is , love . Not a day goes past , you know ... I 'm sorry . It 's fine . Anyway , we 'll be down after the baby 's born . I don 't want to get in the way before . But I 'd really like to hold that baby . Yeah . I think Kate would like me to , don 't you ? Sure . Give my love to James and Sarah and you take care of yourself . - I will do . You too , Jo . - Bye . Thank you . That was ... .. very strange . Yeah . What are you doing ? Taking you to the hospital . What ? No . Just give her a sec , she 'll come back . We 're all dead , right ? Kirstie , she 's gone . Come on , Maria ! Kirstie . This is so fucked up . I 've gotta go back to the surgery now , but make sure you do whatever Elishia tells you to do , OK ? Don 't go anywhere near Vic . Alright ? Well , can we bury her ? You know what she was like . She 'd want us to clean up the mess . OK , do it over there . Not to the hospital ! Not anywhere ! I told you I can 't go near the bridge . I can 't leave Yoorana . - What do you mean ? - Fuck , Chris ! It 's true . Just stop . Bullshit . Just back up . Now . - What the hell ? ! - It 's OK . I 'm OK . I 'm OK . Can I take you to Doveton Street ? No , not home , not Elishia 's . Why not ? Because someone 's looking for us . Oh ! Here it is . My name recorded . Look . What 's that prove ? It 's a record of my return . My rights to my own estate . Nah , we need to get my phone back . That little box you showed me ? Yeah . When you were coming out of the grave . That 's the proof . - Well , where is it now ? - Rory nicked it . That 's the Fitzgeralds for you . Thieves and rogues , the lot of us . Shame she can 't be with her daughter . What if what happened to Maria is gonna happen to us ? That policeman can 't hurt anyone now . No , I don 't mean him . I mean ... I mean what if something bad is gonna happen to each and every one of us . First it was Carlo and now it 's Maria . What do you mean ? Well ... Well , we 're kind of wrong , aren 't we ? And not just the wogs . I mean all of us . We 're not natural . What 's ' natural ' ? Fighting a stupid war ' cause the Brits told us to ? Or getting away with murder ' cause people thought you were a tart ? I don 't believe in ' natural ' anymore . Charlie . I need your help . Keep an eye on him . The policeman . He said you knew why we were back . He said a lot of things . Then why are you doing all this for him ? 'Cause I 'm a doctor . I swore an oath . Look , if there was anything else I could do , I would . 'Charlie ' , isn 't it ? Charlie ... Thompson . I 've nothing to say to you . I know what you 're thinking . You think that I murdered your friend Maria , but I didn 't . Yes , you did . Charlie , Maria died . She died in a car accident 50 years ago . Whatever I did did not end her life . I only returned her to that state that she 'd been in . Her true state . What ? Being dead ? Exactly . Perhaps , Charlie , it ... it 's better than the life here . You see ... .. Maria and you ... .. and Kirstie and Kate - - none of you are supposed to be here . What does that mean ? Think of all your mates who died in that Great War . Died ... screaming for their mothers . You remember your mates , don 't you , Charlie ? Course I bloody do . And you remember someone who didn 't make it back . Yes . When you think of him , doesn 't it make you wonder why you 're standing here now in front of me ... alive instead of him ? No reason . Then can 't you see , Charlie , that your coming back is wrong ? That it makes a total mockery of his death ? Of his sacrifice ? Oh , Charlie . I don 't know how you can live with yourself . Where are you going ? I 've been getting these twinges . - It 's not labour , is it ? - I don 't know . I called the midwife and she said I should go to the hospital . Do you need me to come ? Well , that 's up to you . You left this behind . Is Kate here ? No . She left . - Do you know where she went ? - I don 't know , James . She left . Right . I can 't ... We can 't ... we can 't share you , James . - I 'm not gonna share you . - I know . I know that you never really got over losing Kate , but she 's back , so you can now , alright ? I 'm giving you this chance . Before our baby 's born . I 'll meet you at the hospital , but there 's something I need to do first , OK ? You 're not serious , are you ? Get in the cell . Chris , it 's Kate . I haven 't done anything . - I 'm holding you in custody . - What for ? I don 't know ... Interfering with a grave . My own grave ? Just ... just get in the cell . Please . Just call James , OK ? Chris . Hey . Rory Fitzgerald ? Should the defendant be approaching the witness ? You should be charged . Supplying to a minor . That 's a bit ungrateful , mate . My young friend 's property , we 'd like it back . My phone , dickhead . Oh , that piece of shit , nah , I chucked it . Well , we 'd appreciate it if you , uh , you could retrieve it . Sorry , who the fuck are you ? Where 'd you get that ? Your show bag ? I 'll tell you what , why don 't you get it back for us or I 'll gut you like a fish ? OK , do something , will you ? This guy 's fuckin ' crazy . Paddy , he 's a scumbag , but he 's still family . Paddy , enough ! Arseholes ! Paddy . Paddy . Are you OK ? Paddy . It ... My own family . My own flesh and blood . What ? They murdered me . Mate . James . - I think we should call up the ... - Just open the cell door , alright ? - Will you just let me deal with this ? - I 'm worried about you . We don 't know why or how or ... we don 't know what she is . - She 's Kate . - Maybe she isn 't . If you want to help me find answers , run a background search on Elishia McKellar . I need associations , just get me everything . The doctor knows about this ? - Yes . - What ... Fu ... Why haven 't you said anything ? You 've totally failed to report any of this . I don 't care . Oh , good . I thought we were mates . Vic knows , doesn 't he ? Yes . - Where is he ? - Don 't ask . You 've fucked up big-time . You know that ? I know . I 've got the antibiotics , I 've got anaesthetics and we need your help . General pre-op care is not orthopaedics . No , I know , but you 're better than nothing . We have to do this . Vic ... he knows something . OK . Elishia 's prescriptions are all PC . - What does that mean ? - Professional Corporation . It means the doctor 's a part of a corporation and protected by those laws . - Mm ? - Which corporation is it ? Noregard Pharmaceuticals . They make antivirals , don 't they ? Spoken to Sarah ? Not yet . She 's at the hospital . I 'm gonna meet her there . She told Chris about me . What ? No . That 's why he stopped me . He was taking me to Shep . Over the bridge . Sarah wouldn 't have done that . I have nothing . No proof . No house . No land . And no position . You 're alive . Ah . But for what purpose ? At least you know what happened to you . I died a hated man . My own son murdered me . And my wife watched me die . I never knew ... never knew my daughter ... .. or your great-great-grandmother . I 'm off to juvie now for sure . I 'm sorry , son . That 's OK . But don 't call me ' son ' . 'The Lord is my shepherd . I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . ' Start with debridement of devitalised tissue and bone . And then irrigation . Got the saline ready . Keep an eye on his blood pressure . 'He leadeth me beside the still waters . He restoreth my soul . He ... ' 'Yea . Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... .. I will fear no evil . ' OK . Traction . Yep . That 's it . 'For Thou art with me . Thy rod and Thy staff , they comfort me . And surely goodness and mercy will follow me through all the days of my life . And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever . ' It 's done . He 's OK . You think he 'll survive ? Long enough to kill you all . Then what do we do ? There 's nothing that I can do . I 'm not gonna kill anyone . You 'll do what needs to be done . I know you will . The wound is healing . Start of the proliferation phase already , but ... it 's not supposed to happen for days . - What 's happening ? - You 've had an operation . You 're on very strong painkillers and antibiotics . You mustn 't move , OK ? I 'm thirsty . OK . You just stay here and I 'll get you some water and another pillow . His wound 's healing . I 've got him on a very strong bacteriostatic - - that 'll increase the rate of healing . It 's moving too fast . What is going on with him ? I don 't know . You 're working for Noregard . I found these invoices at the surgery . Flu injections . I give them to employees once a year . - What else do you do for them ? - Do you mind ? - I 'm trying to clean ... - Don 't you fuckin ' lie to me ! I told you before , I do not work for Noregard . - Then what is it ? - They 're working for me . Before I moved here , I was a researcher . For Noregard . I don 't know anything about what 's been going on here . I 've just been using the facilities for my analysis , that 's all . And I 've stopped now . I know what your plan is . But you 've got it all wrong . That doctor ... She wants to kill me . She can 't do it herself , so she 's ... she 's trying to get you to do it . She 's looking after us . You are one of them , aren 't you ? The dead . But you 're different . You 're stronger . Who are you ? No-one . Do you remember your death ? No . I can help you . Help you remember . Near my belt ... Over there . Do you know what it is ? It 's mine . I found it in her things . She 'd been keeping it . If you want to know what happened when you died , use it . If you want to know the truth . What did you remember ? In the end , I wanted to die . You should have been allowed to . The meaning of life is that it stops . There must be rules . No-one can escape that . You know what I 'm saying is true . Who are you ? I 'm not what you think I am . Neither is Elishia . She 's manipulating you . You need to help me bring this to an end . We have to return you all of you . No . No , I won 't kill anyone . You won 't have to . But I ... I can 't do this on my own . Agh ! - James ! - Shut up ! James ... Drive ! - We 've gotta go . - No , wait . No , no , no . He 's leaving . Stop ! Get in ! Go , go , go , go , go . Stop the car . Charlie ! Get in there . - Charlie ! - Just drive ! Nurse ... where is he ? I 'm sure he 'll be here soon . Doing well , Sarah . Good girl . Breathe deeply . Breathe deep . I 'm not driving across the bridge . - Drive ! - No ! Just drive ! Come here ! - You 're coming with me . - Agh ! Get out of the car . Let her go ! John , step away . Come on ! - Leave me alone ! - Help me . - Charlie . - Ignore her , Charlie . Let her go ! You know what you have to do . Go ! Charlie , don 't ! Please , I don 't want to die . Keep going , Charlie . Don 't stop . Charlie . No ! Go on , do it . Put things right . Charlie ! Don 't ! Finish it now . Charlie ... Charlie ! If you don 't do this , she 'll suffer and die again . The cancer will return . No matter what you do , she 'll lose her hair and her breasts , she 'll lie there gasping for breath . Oh ! Charlie ! Come on . Come on , Charlie . You 're OK . Mate , come on . You 're alright . John . John , listen to me . - You lied to us . - I care about you . John ... John . Shh . You had no choice - - he would 've killed them all . Why ? Because that wasn 't Vic . The real Vic ... .. died when he had that accident . Then who is that ? I don 't know . But we gotta get him out of here . And you can 't be seen . It 's OK . No , it 's not . You can 't stay here . You have to go . I have to see Sarah . She 's in hospital . And you should go . Is he dying ? It 's an anaesthetic . He 'll be out for a couple of hours . Let 's go . I need to be alone . I 'll be OK , I promise . - Should we say something ? - Yeah . Fuck you , arsehole . Well , thank you for looking out for me before . Yeah , well , someone 's got to . You 're a real mate . And I love ya . Yeah , well , that 's all I need - - a poofter falling in love with me . Nah , I didn 't say I was in love with ya . Mm ! What 's a ' poofter ' ? Don 't worry about it . Is everything alright ? All fine . The baby 's just keen to be born , that 's all . You OK ? Breathe deeply and slowly , Sarah . That 's good . Good girl , Sarah . It 's just the drugs wearing off . You know , I wasn 't just gonna let you die . Why not ? - I shouldn 't be here . - Don 't say that . You had no right to bring me back . OK . A bit more pushing . You 're doing really well . Ohh ! I can see your baby 's head crowning . Stop pushing . No pushing . That 's it . Good girl . No pushing . No pushing . Gentle breathing . Good , Sarah . That 's it . Hello . Hello . Hello . ♪ PENSIVE MUSIC 'The last will and testament of Patrick Michael Fitzgerald . ' Yeah . It 's OK . Here . - There we go . - James . - James . - What 's wrong ? It 's OK , Sarah .

Had a normal delivery 20 minutes ago . - So cold . - What 's wrong ? - We 'll need to get her to surgery . - Why ? I think her uterus is not contracting properly .

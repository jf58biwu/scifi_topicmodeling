 ( CAR HORNS BLARE ) I don 't know how long I 'm going to be . There 's been an incident . Traffic 's backed up across the bridge . ( POLICE SIREN ) Clear the road . Shout when you see him . ' Help me ! " Go away ! - What are you doing ? - Please help me ! Give me the phone ! - Jesus Christ ! Go away ! - Give me the phone now ! Come on ! - Please ! - Go away ! Go ! Go ! Over here ! They 're coming ! They 're coming ! - OFFICER : There he is . - They 're coming ! They 're coming ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Right , that 's far enough . Don 't shoot ! Stop ! ( MAN SCREAMS ) Someone beat him , doused him in petrol . The spark from the taser ignited the vapor . So the poor guy gets loose only for one of our lads to blow him up . NURSE : 500ml of normal saline to run over six hours . Five minutes . Hello . I 'm Detective Inspector Clayton , this is Detective Sergeant Chohan . What 's your name , son ? Dear God , look at him . This will be the glass they picked out of him . Smacked with a bottle while they were beating him , maybe ? I don 't think so . This is plate glass . I 'd say he went through a window . - ( MONITOR BEEPS FASTER ) - Easy , easy , easy , son . - ( RAPID BREATHING ) - Easy , you 're safe now . Who were you running from ? Golding ... ( BEEPING STOPS ) It 's awful . Mum keeps being nice and Nikhal wants to take us to the zoo . - Nikhal ? - That 's what I have to call him now . That 's my friend , Kerry . - Hello , Kerry . - Dad ! ( CHUCKLES ) Go on then . Suri , any joy with legal ? SURI : Yes . The postmortem showed he was attacked before he was tasered . Good . Following up on the glass fragments , I 've spoken to a glazier who was called out to fix a broken window in a derelict house near Albert Bridge . They were worried about a broken window . The place is a bloody wreck . Ideal for a beating , though . No one will ever hear you scream . - Can I help you ? - ( DOG BARKS ) - Zack McGinnis ? - What of it ? Aggravated burglary . Seven years , Whitecross Prison . Do you remember me ? Well , I got rehabilitated . I was out in four . - And now you 're a security guard ? - I 've repurposed my skills . Open up . Does the firm know you 've got a record ? They got me straight from the Whitecross Outreach Program . Sent me on a course . Gave me a uniform . HARRY : And the twitchy nervous dog ? She 's a rescue . I 've got a pair . I found this broken this morning . So I called the glaziers to fix it . Broken in or out ? Looks like someone went through it . - ( BARKS ) - ZACK : Gina ! Gina , come on ! Wait ! - I 'll go with him . - I 'll check outside . Rats . She smells rats , she 's away . All I can smell is petrol . What 's up there ? I don 't know . No one goes up there . They do now . Move . No one comes up here ? This has got nothing to do with me . - I 'm gonna go and call my boss . - HARRY : Oi ! I 'll make any calls . Come back . Give that dog a bone . Any luck with the prints ? They 've cut the fingers off to take to the lab . They reckon they 've had results from worse . Is that him ? Yeah , last use of the card three hours before the tasering . SURI : If we 've traced the card , why do we need the prints ? Because it isn 't his card . Watch this . That 's a bit OTT for a cash-point mugging . Ha ! It 's a boutique bank in Mayfair and the charge card has a cash limit of Â£ 10,000 . The card belongs to a Miss Indira Kamal . She 's a student . SURI : Fancy place for student digs . HARRY : You should 've seen mine . ( VIDEO GAME BEEPS ) Hello . INDIRA : What 's this about ? We recovered a charge card in your name . Were you aware of losing one ? Um ... I don 't think so . Maybe . I don 't keep track . HARRY : Suri . SURI : Do you recognize this man ? ( SPANISH ACCENT ) His name is Anton Burgstrom . He 's from Sweden . - Who are you , sir ? - Joachin Agosto . Are you a student too ? Si . We all are . I 'm sorry to tell you , but Anton is dead . H OW ? SURI : We 're still working on that . Does Anton have any relatives in London ? Not that I know . Well , where did he study ? Live ? Perhaps you didn 't know him quite as well as you thought . - That was weird . - Yeah . She finds out Anton 's stealing from her , doesn 't blink . Is this a ransom gone wrong ? No , the kidnapper wouldn 't torture his asset . You do that for punishment or revenge . Print section 's got a match from one of the fingers . So our dead Swedish boy has a history of fraud and petty theft and his name wasn 't Anton , it was Tony . Tony from Dalston . You can 't start an action without making an official complaint . You know the rules as well as anyone . Rules can be bent . I 'm going to pretend I didn 't hear that . I can 't go running to the authorities . I am the authority . Clayton 's a loose cannon . Don 't you have enough on him by now ? He 's also an effective officer with the luck of the devil . You can 't dislodge him that easily . I sometimes wonder if you might be happier in a different line of work . Don 't waste your time wondering ; it isn 't your call . I might surprise you . Surprise me with one of these . Find a way to get rid of him . And keep my name out of it . HARRY : Tony from Dalston . It doesn 't quite have the Playboy ring to it . - ( WHISTLES ) - Expensive tastes , though . Bloody hell ! Well , you 've got to give him credit for aiming high . The guy that nicked my VISA went to Nando 's . He 's got fake student IDs for every high-end college in town . He 's been Anton , Antoine , Anton , Anton ... Adonis ? So he mixes with the rich foreign students by posing as one of them . He 's been Italian , Latvian , Swedish and American . Whatever suits the con . Well , let 's seal the flat and seize the contents . Oh yeah , anything on the laptop ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) No , password protected . Nice watch . It 's got an inscription . To Sasha . SURI : That 'll be useful . - IT guy had this for you . - Thanks . Um , so ... What led Harry to set his sights on the deputy mayor ? Whatever you can tell me , it doesn 't have to go any further . There 's this one retired officer who used to work with Frierson . Jim Stepton ? It all seemed to take off after Harry bumped into him . There you go . What 's that ? - A password cracker . - Oh , right . The brute-force algorithm on this one runs eight million guesses a second , so this shouldn 't take too long . Right , anything useful ? He made files on each of his targets . Indira Kamal . Date of birth , place of birth , mother 's maiden name . All the questions they ask you in bank security . Play the video . ( HARRY CHUCKLES ) Well , Indira and ... Joachin . Hidden camera . Tony filmed the women he robbed . In flagrante , the dirty dog . I 'm in the wrong job . It 's blackmail , Harry . Think about the backgrounds some of these girls come from . Traditional values . Any hint of this gets out and they 're on the next plane back home . Have a look for anyone called Sasha . SURI : Harry , that 's supposed to be in Evidence . Yeah , with an inscription on the back . " To Sasha , in friendship . " From Golding ? Look , there it is there , see ? Sasha . ( SIGHS ) Oh , my God . It 's Joachin , they 're a team . Right , so Joachin seduces the girls , Tony nips in and plunders the fortune . If the girls are anything like Indira , they 're inexperienced , unsupervised . Yeah , and they 're a long way from home . Do we think one of the other girls may be angry enough to have ordered a hit ? I wouldn 't rule it out . SURI : Who 's Golding , Harry ? I really don 't know . Come on . First we hear it from the guy in the hospital this morning , then it turns up on the back of the watch , and each time his name is mentioned , I can practically hear your mind working the angles . I think it 's a cover name for a seriously dangerous career criminal operating a lot of different fronts . So why am I having to prise this out of you ? Because I don 't have one solid fact that I can share with you . Hello . Do you remember lndira 's birthday from her file ? - It 's never that easy . - It 's what I would try . ( DOOR UNLOCKS ) ( CLICKS TONGUE ) - That never happens for me . - HARRY : Indira ? Miss Kamal ? Suri ! They 've gone down the fire escape ! ( TIRES SCREECH ) I 'd have got you one in , but ... Not at this hour . We don 't all have the luxury of early retirement . Your message said that you wanted to pick my brains about the Marston brothers . Yeah . Not strictly true . Then what ? Karl Frierson . Harry Clayton came to see you , didn 't he ? We bumped into each other . Harry pulled up an old case . The murder of Maria Alexandri . I saw that he requested the files . That case was reassigned to you and Karl Frierson . Was that what he wanted to talk about ? - I need to get on . - ( KEYS RATTLE ) Harry has his faults . Um ... Believe me , he has many . But he has a nose for these things . Sometimes it 's not the job , but everything else that compromises you . Makes you vulnerable . And then people like Frierson either become your friend or your enemy . What did he make you do ? Harry was right . There was a suspect . The Alexandri Case could have been solved . ( KEYS RATTLE ) We 've got two Dalston boys conning money out of rich foreign students . - Joachin ... - Jeff Hadley , also known as Jed . Two juvenile convictions for twocking with Tony as codefendant . HARRY : Jed romances the kids , Tony strips the assets , with a sex tape as insurance against repercussions . Then we come to Sasha . SURI : Sasha Terekhova of St Petersburg . Tony gathers the details , but what he should have picked up on is her father owns the biggest adult cable network in Eastern Europe . And that 's the respectable end of the business . Well , how 's this for a theory ? The boys pick Sasha Terekhova as a mark , but she 's no pushover . The Terekhova family have a London connection and that 's Golding . They lift Tony . They torture him to give up Jed . Tony escapes . Golding 's men are probably out on the hunt for Jed right now . With Indira caught in the middle . All the more reason to proceed with care . You can stop pretending . Go ahead and cry if you want to . I know what Anton meant to you . Maybe later . What 's going on ? I don 't understand . We ran from the police . You didn 't even wait to find out what happened . I lost a dear friend to an accident . What do the details matter ? They don 't send detectives out for an accident . Anton and I ... we may have annoyed some bad people . I need to get far away from London . You should probably get far away from me . I 'm not leaving you . Just be honest with me . I can survive . Probably . Even though I still can 't access my trust fund . Since my father ... You know , the big argument . I have all the money we need . We could go abroad . - Monaco , Monte Carlo . - Wherever you say . Somewhere warm . With a casino . SURI : So this is Sasha 's London residence ? HARRY : Yep . - How are we going to play this ? - Cagily . So don 't rock the boat . You asked for a meeting with Miss Terekhova . - And you are ? - I 'm a friend of her father 's . He 's asked me to look after her while she 's in London . - Will we have a problem ? - Not from me . Alexandra Terekhova . I prefer Sasha . You 're the policeman ? DI Clayton . Do you recognize this ? I have one like it . If we found it in a dead boy 's flat . He and his mate made a practice of befriending rich young women and ... defrauding them . Would you know anything about that ? I don 't have any friends . My parents expect me to study . Well , these boys target students . The further away from home , the better . Look around , Mr Clayton . Do I seem ... vulnerable to you ? - Where are you a student ? - The Courtauld Institute . I study fine art Is this a questioning under caution , Detective Clayton , or are we just ... having a chat ? You 're well up on the law , Miss Terekhova . - Sasha . - If you 've been deceived , Sasha , your parents don 't need to know . But we are investigating a murder . So you 're asking for my help to punish these thieves ? I think one fatal punishment is more than enough . Well , good luck with your version of justice , Detective . Can I have my watch now ? Yeah , can you confirm it 's yours ? Who is ... Golding ? Perhaps I 've got the wrong Sasha . Well , perhaps you do . Will you give me a call , if you have ... an epiphany ? Sure . - ( TEXT ALERT ) - I 'd say we 've been stonewalled . It 's a text from Anna . We should have let our own people handle this . The point was not to put yourself at risk . ( SCOFFS ) Please , Miss Terekhova . We value your father 's friendship . I won 't deny that our man botched the job , and he 'll suffer for that . Now allow us to set this right . You had your chance . - Papa can deal with the policeman . - You see , that 's what I mean . Forgive me , Sasha , but you 're a long way from home . You shove a British policeman under a bus and there are consequences . Especially if that man is Harry Clayton . You let me take care of it . - I 've only got a few minutes . - What 's so urgent ? Is it Daisy ? No , no , she 's fine . Listen , you know the Outreach Program means I 've been spending a lot of time at Whitecross ? I was aware of that . Well , it turns out you were right about the Kevin Grey suicide . Does the name Golding mean anything to you ? - Why ? - I got it from one of the inmates . I asked him how Grey died and he said it was Golding . He was really scared , Harry . - Stop right there . - I think I 'm onto something . I need to get these people to trust me . This is incredibly dangerous , Anna . - It 's not dangerous ... - Walk away from this now . Harry , I 'm not just doing this for you . I understand that , but just because you 're seeing Governor Julian ... I 'm not seeing Governor Julian ... Oh , my God . - I don 't have time for your jealousy . - No , it 's nothing to do with that . Listen to me . It 's not that ... Listen , Anna , you don 't understand . I understand perfectly well . You asked me to help and I helped . ( SIGHS ) Someone 's just tried to access Indira Kamal 's account . They 're in a hotel . OK , let 's get to them before they get kicked out . Right . SURI : So are you going to tell me what 's going on ? Golding 's name came up again . We 're close , I can feel it . He 's playing too many tables , stepping on too may cracks . - I can 't work like this . - Like what ? Listen to yourself . When you 're not keeping secrets , you 're talking in riddles . It 's gambler 's logic , Harry . Runs of luck and winning streaks ? - It 's all in your mind . - No , it isn 't . He 's out there . That 's why we need to formulate a proper plan to catch him , not just chase down every hunch you get and hope for the best . A man like this doesn 't play by any hard and fast rules . ( TIRES SCREECH / SURI SCREAMS ) SURI : Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! No ! What are you doing ? Oh , my God ! - Harry ! - MAN : Oh , shit ! - HARRY : It 's alright . - ( PANTS ) - You alright , mate ? - Yeah , yeah . - Sorry . It 's all under control , OK ? - Yeah . HARRY : Thanks . What the hell was that ? Why did you let go of the wheel ? - The brakes locked , it was the only ... - That 's bullshit ! You just totally relinquished control of the vehicle . Well , I panicked . I 'm sorry . You knew what you were doing ! You stopped me from grabbing the wheel ! You could have flipped us over . - So you just left it all to chance ? - Alright , just ... I 'm driving . Hello , Paul . So , you 're my escort for the evening , are you ? Your housekeeper wasn 't even a little bit shocked . ( LAUGHS ) - Your mum was so lovely . - As was yours . So ... It 's been a while . - I 've um ... been in hiding . - It 's a good thing too . You rather upset people when you gave the bracelet to the detective . Which people specifically , Paul ? Who 's Golding ? Maybe it 's me . No , we 've known each other since we were children . You can stop pretending . I know you 're afraid . Don 't protect him . Paul ? Golding wants the bracelet . He 's going to try and kill Harry , force me to give it to him . Harry 's strong now . Paul , you know what the bracelet can do . If you help us , we can take him down . Our room keys don 't work . Sod it out . - Which room is it ? - The presidential suite . I 'm sorry , sir , the lady 's card has been declined . Try it again . Do you have another means of payment ? ( LAUGHS ) Look , do you know who her father is ? We could buy this entire hotel and have you fired . That would work too . Anton had my other card . Look , let us into the room . We can call the bank and sort it out . ( SIGHS ) Call someone . - Who ? - Any of your friends . - We need cash . - I can 't just ask my friends for money . Fine . We 'll stand here then . ( COCKNEY ACCENT ) Make the call ! - Is Joachin even your name ? - Call me what you like . We need travelling cash or you 're looking at a dead man . - No , no , no , you don 't . - Let go of her , Jed . Don 't end up like Tony , son . Who set the dogs on us ? Was it Sasha ? - You tell us . - That bitch said she knew someone . She wasn 't kidding . - Excuse me , what 's going on ? - Police . Stay where you are . - Hey , Suri ! Suri ! - INDIRA : Let go of me ! - ( SURI MUMBLES ) - HARRY : Hey ! Come on . Jed , Jed . I thought you were supposed to be a charmer . You 're just a thug who hits women . I can do a lot worse if you push me . You 're already in a hole . Stop digging - Suri ? Suri ! Suri ! Suri ! Suri . You ! Stay right where you are ! Fuck off . We 're in love . - HARRY : Suri . Suri . - INDIRA : Let go of me ! Hey ! Hey ! Suri ! HARRY : I really think you should go to hospital . SURI : No , I 'm fine . - No , no . - Get on the bed . - No , no , no . - Come on . It 's fine , it 's fine . - You need to sleep . - I just need five minutes . Yeah , yeah . Other foot . Come on . ( SIGHS ) ( WHISPERS ) Kaleem , it 's Jed . Ah , I was wondering when I was gonna get a call . It 's all gone a bit Long Good Friday for you , hasn 't it ? I need a couple of fast passports . You 're shit out of luck , son . My passport guy is on indefinite leave . Well , then find another . Name your price . Two passports and a safe way to France . Train , boat , plane , anything . How can you pay ? ' ? Got me a meal ticket . Her dad 's a five-times billionaire , Indian steel magnate or some such . The point is , she 's good for it . 100 . What , pounds ? Thousand . For two bits of paper and a Channel hop ? What happened to " name your price " ? Take it or leave it . Yeah , OK . I 'll be in touch . - Can I help you , sir ? - No , I 'm fine , thanks . It 's late , so I 'll get to the point . Harry Clayton . Your friend and mine . Well , everyone wants to see him taken down . But no one seems to be able to lay a glove on him . Try telling that to my boss . Seems to think I can work miracles . Frankly , I don 't think your boss has the stomach to do what it takes . The question is , do you ? Well , that depends . What , on what 's in it for you ? On where it begins and ends . I 'm looking for an honest man with honest ambitions . But look , Detective Superintendent Winter has put the job on your shoulders . Why do you think that is ? - I 'm sure you 're about to tell me . - Hmm . He 's a careful man . He 's thinking of the inquiry when Clayton finally implodes . Someone must be seen to have failed , and it isn 't going to be him . I 'd like to see a better man in that job . Kaleem . Remind me ? Mr Collins , you might remember me . We have a mutual friend . - What 's it about ? - You 're looking for someone . He needs my help to get some rich girl out of the country . I told him 100 grand . 100 grand for two passports ? Well , I like your style . ( KALEEM LAUGHS ) Well ... I tell you what , Kaleem . You text me his number and I 'll take it from there . And if Harry Clayton comes sniffing around , you tell him nothing . - You understand ? - My lips are sealed , Mr Collins . I thank you . And my employer thanks you . Though I doubt very much Jed will want to thank you . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) So when your mother was murdered , Frierson was the officer running the investigation . He sat there and held my hand . Told me he would do everything humanly possible to find her killer . He did everything possible to shut it down . He succeeded . I was so new to the department , I had no idea what he was doing . Well , he had a rotten head . No wonder he needed another . It was his kidney , but ... yeah . I so nearly got him on that . The downside is that he now knows that I 'm onto him . He couldn 't be Golding , could he , hiding in plain sight ? You could say the same thing about Paul Lermentov . Or any amount of others . That 's why you have to be careful . The bracelet may give you protection . But no one is invincible . It 's done a pretty good job so far . He can 't resist it . Look , he 's meeting you more than halfway . Just give him a chance , OK ? I asked for popcorn , but they only had pretzels . - Pretzels are fine . - Are we having fun ? Dais ? Course we are . A day in the park . What 's not to like ? - This park . - ( PHONE RINGS ) Oh ... I should probably get this . You go ahead . Come on , Daisy . Let 's go find the ducks . Harry , what are you doing ? It 's Saturday morning . - Are you at the zoo ? - No . I 'm only asking . - I just wanted to check Daisy was OK . - Look , I ... We had a long talk and I explained . I 've been working closely with Nikhal and she shouldn 't read too much into the friendship . What , and did she buy that ? So what do you reckon ? Do ducks like pretzels ? Does anyone ? I 'm not your enemy , Daisy . Can 't we just get along ? Was that so hard ? ( ANNA SIGHS ) What 's going on ? Feed the lawyer . Tuppence a bag . Don 't mind if I do . Thanks , love . Here . I really think you need to go and see a doctor . I 'm fine . Suri , you 've had a serious blow to the head . Thanks , love . You should take some time out . ( PHONE RINGS ) - DI Clayton . - I wasn 't entirely honest with you . Miss Terekhova . I want to make a statement . Can we meet ? - Come to the station . - Not an official one . Why am I not surprised ? Meet me at the marina . OK , I 'll meet you there . - Where are we going ? - You 're not going anywhere . You need to rest . Here . Eat up . I 'll call you later , OK ? - Kaleem says it 's berth number 54 . - No . No more . - ( SCREAMS ) - It 's too late for that . - I 'll pay you to let me go ! - Yeah , with what ? I still have money . You 're the only reason I can 't get to it . We 'll discuss it on the way over . Here we go , 54 . Wow . This is more like it . Hello ? Right , come on . How far can you get without a crew ? Stop , go , forward , back . How hard can it be ? ( SCOFFS ) ( PHONE RINGS ) Kaleem , you have surpassed yourself . How do I start this thing ? COLLINS : This isn 't Kaleem , but it 's nice to be appreciated . Who are you ? You really don 't need to know . You see a towel ? Lift it . ( INDIRA GASPS ) What 's going on ? You deal with the detective and you 're on your way to France . What detective ? Miss Terekhova ? Sasha ? I knew I was being set up . What about you ? Shut up . - Where 's Indira ? - Here . You OK ? So what 's the deal , Jed ? You shoot me for them and all is forgiven ? Sounds fair to me . It 's not so easy to shoot someone with a handgun , Jed . Despite what you see in the films . But go ahead . Take your best shot . Stop talking . Maybe I 'll get lucky . Maybe you will . But I should tell you , when I get lucky , someone always loses out . ( INDIRA SCREAMS ) Again . Last chance . Now send Indira down and let 's talk about Golding . - No ! - ( SCREAMS ) Come on . Come on ! - ( ENGINE STARTS ) - Yes . HARRY : I 've got you . We 're good . Oh , come on ... Forgive me . You 've sewed your purpose , Jed . I 'm afraid that I lied about it doing any good though . ( JED GRUNTS ) ( JED GRUNTS ) ( BOTH COUGH AND SPLUTTER ) You OK ? ( TIRES SCREECH ) Hello , lover . ( KNIFE MECHANISM CLICKS ) SURI : Harry , uniform have found Jed 's body in the derelict house . Zack McGinnis . They killed the guard as well . It 's an execution staged as suicide . It 's Golding . He 's covering his tracks .

 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Baron von Strucker thought that Sunil Bakshi was well-groomed to serve , so why is he not present ? Man : Compliance will be rewarded . Your father was good once . - He 's a monster . - Just one dinner . [ Chuckles ] Ethan . I hear you 're headed away . Taking some time to backpack . I need you to get me into Fury 's toolbox . It 's way beyond anything I 've ever encountered . Without Coulson , I 'm afraid it 's just a piece of junk . Are we having any issues following Agent Fitz ? You tailed him ? - Fitz : Hunter ! - Fitz ? Maybe you could show me how to shake a tail . Like , now ? 2x18 - " The Frenemy of My Enemy " [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Music ] [ Tires screech , horns honk ] That won 't end well . - Ohh . - Get us in the air . Deathlok : Will do . - Mike ? - Hey , Fitz . Good to see you again . New hardware . Hey , how did you upgrade ... - Not now , Fitz . - Hunter : Strap in . Hey , those tips for evading the tail were very useful . - Thanks . [ Breathes sharply ] - The toolbox ? Fitz : Yeah , it 's been a while since I 've been in the field solo . - Not since , um ... - Well , looks like you held up all right . Yeah . Held up quite well , actually . And you ? Fitz , we need to find Skye . Problem is , all we know is that she was taken by the same powered man who took Raina and Cal . - Do we have any leads ? - No , but HYDRA might . HYDRA 's new heads ... Strucker and List . My sources say they 're researching powered people . Apparently , they 're even more obsessed than Whitehall . We need to know what they know ... get into HYDRA . Desperate times , desperate measures . Count me in . I 'm relieved to hear you say that . We 're making a deal ... with Ward . Man : Ethan Johnston , 26 , potential enhanced . Died of cardiogenic shock in the 37th hour of experimentation . - Still no quantum signature ? - No , Dr. List . That 's a waste . Take the cadaver to the lab . Compare him to the other samples . Hail HYDRA . [ Birds chirping ] Cal : I told you I 'd put our family back together . Yes , you did . Last night was ... something ... almost exactly as I imagined it . Some things were different . - She 's still afraid of me . - Whose fault is that , Cal ? No , I know . I know . You 're right . I just ... I-I wish she could have known me back when we were first married , when I was calm and my ... my mind wasn 't so ... jumbled . We 've both changed . We 're not the people we used to be . To lament that is a waste of time . You 're right . She 's here now ... with us , right ? [ Chuckling ] That 's pretty cool , right ? Me being here puts you in a tough spot ... I know . I-I know . I see the stink-eye from everyone . They know you 're not like us . They 're wondering why you 're here . I don 't want to make things harder for you . I 'll stay here , be quiet , and wait for our next family dinner . Hey , how about next time , we grill , huh ? - Whatever you like . - Yeah . In the meantime , why don 't I have Gordon take you to pick up some of your belongings - so that your time here is less ... - Prison-like ? [ Both chuckle ] That would be fan-frigging-tastic . I miss my tunes . [ Chuckles ] Sorry . I wish I didn 't have to , but ... [ Clears throat ] - Is it my go ? - You 're about a million miles away . [ Sighs ] Sorry . I 'm back at dinner . Dinner with my parents can stress me out , too . [ Sighs ] It wasn 't stressful , exactly . I mean , I didn 't want to see Cal , let alone be in the same room as him . I was sure he was gonna have some twisted surprise , but he didn 't . It was ... nice . That 's good . [ Chuckles ] Isn 't it ? Did Jiaying tell you that she 's sending Cal away ? - He 's not coming back . - He doesn 't exactly belong here . - You think it 's a bad idea . - It 's not a good one . He 'll get upset , and someone will get hurt . Talk to her . She 's your mom . [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] Yeah . It 's nice having someone normal to talk to . [ Chuckles ] [ Electricity crackles ] You hit me ! [ Grunts ] Finally , an actual partner . [ Grunting ] [ Grunts ] Little tip ... could have avoided losing your footing if you would have flipped into it . A flip ? Now you 're just making fun of me . Maybe a little . It 's not like I can bench-press a small hatchback . Yeah . We all have our talents . Aah ! How 's Simmons doing on Fury 's toolbox ? - You ask me ... she 's stalling . - Maybe . [ Both grunting ] It doesn 't bother you ? Ohh . I 'm out . A lot bothers me . It bothers me that we 've been so focused on Coulson and Fury 's toolbox ... I mean , we have a ... have a tail on Fitz , for god 's sakes . It 's not like HYDRA 's gone . Coulson may be a lot of things , but he 's not the enemy . You sound like Hunter . Well , he might have been right on this one . Yeah , I 've been wondering that myself . The only way to move forward right now is to get the truth out . Any idea how to get the truth out of Fury 's toolbox ? Uh-huh . It 's flying in from the aircraft carrier as we speak . They 're bringing in some state-of-the-art , - next-gen fiber laser . - That can cut through vibranium ? - If anything can . - Good . It 's time we have it all out in the open . [ Door closes ] It 's not exactly quite so simple . - Simmons , what did you do ? - I duplicated the box ... switched out Fury 's real box for a fake , and all this time , I 've been pretending to be working on it , when ... - Where is the real box now ? - Fitz has it . I didn 't know who else to turn to . The ... you 're the only one I can trust here anymore . I 'll handle it . Kara : Thanks for the picture ... Really helped clear things up . Wait , Mom , what men ? When exactly did they call ? Okay , if they call again , don 't say a word . I 've got to go ... call when I can . [ Dialing ] Agent 33 . You 're looking well . [ Dogs barking in distance ] [ Car door opens ] [ Cellphone ringing ] - Hey , baby . - Coulson : Hey , sweetie . Why don 't you drop by ? Love to catch up . That mask on your face ... - got any more of those lying around ? - Afraid not . At least I have my winning personality . They didn 't hurt you , did they ? No , I 'm okay . You shouldn 't have come . Fact that this guy hasn 't killed me yet means they need me . - Mike . - Ward . Turn around . You know what needs to happen . All of it . [ Metal clinks ] [ Sighs ] Ward . I 'm flattered ... bringing the robot along just for a sit-down with me . There 's no need for false modesty . We both know you 're that good . But frankly , this isn 't about you . I 'm after bigger fish ... Strucker , List . Can 't help you ... not in HYDRA anymore . But you were . Even then , I only knew them by reputation ... never met either . [ Scoffs ] Again with the false modesty . You 're resourceful . Bet you know a guy who knows a guy . You know , last time I suggested we work together , you called me a deluded son of a bitch . Things change . I 'm offering you a deal ... help me , and I 'll let you walk away , free and clear ... no more looking over your shoulder . When something 's too good to be true , it 's a lie . Not lying . I tried the stick with you before ... it didn 't work so well , so I 'm offering a carrot . - I 'm listening . - Get me inside . After that , I put you through the Tahiti protocol , - and then you 're free to go . - Wipe my memories ? Well , that sounds like a threat , not a carrot . - I like who I am . - A murderer and a traitor . Sorry . My offer 's the only way you leave here . I 'm taking a huge chance . You could have run . You didn 't . You risked your freedom for her ... that says something , says that maybe there 's still good left in you . Maybe Garrett , your family didn 't destroy all that . Tahiti will erase all the bad , let you be the man you want to be , start over . Free and clear . I give you my word as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. I might know a guy . [ Simmons scoffs ] No , no , no , no . No ! I 'd just hoped the highly modified hydrofluoric - acid might cr ... - Stop . - I told her the truth . - Truth about what , exactly ? Fitz replaced Fury 's toolbox with a fake , ran off with the real one , and you 've been covering for him since . Nobody 's happy about it . I understand you 're confused ... who to trust , where to put your loyalties . Yes , I am . But we 've lost Coulson , the box , and Fitz . Eventually , I 'm gonna have to tell Gonzales and the rest of the board what happened . Unless we can find Coulson another way . You know Mike Peterson 's hardware . - You want me to try to tap into his feed ? - Will that be a problem ? An opportunity to exonerate Coulson and Fitz ? No , it 's not a problem . I 'll keep you updated . [ Crickets chirping ] [ Sighs ] This is crazy . [ Chest closes ] We want to find Skye , yes , okay ? - But we are making a deal with ... - The devil . I 'm afraid it 's in the job description , mate ... expedient alliances with despicable characters . - You 'd work with Bobbi ? - No , not a chance . And point made . Look , mate , we 're infiltrating HYDRA . Our options are limited . Ward is a psychopath , but for now , he 's our psychopath , so we use him to stay one step ahead . [ Birds chirping ] I 've searched the records ... no mention of precognition . Raina could be the first of her kind . I was . A gift like hers could change everything . Imagine ... she could warn us of threats before they happen . If that is her gift . [ Knock on door ] Ah , sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt . - No , we 're finished here . - I 'll let you know how it goes . Was that about Cal ? I want to talk to you about that . Cal 's dangerous , I know , but he 's better when he 's with us . That may be true , but he can 't stay here . - Well , can we give him a heads-up or ... - And risk how he gets ? You think you 've seen him at his worst . You haven 't . That 's my point . You know how he 'll get when Gordon just abandons him in the middle of nowhere . - Not nowhere ... we 're taking him home . - It doesn 't matter . He will feel abandoned , and people will get hurt . - Those people aren 't my concern . - Well , they 're mine . I 'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . The longer he stays , the more attention he draws , the more attention he demands . I can 't make exceptions . He 's not one of us . Sometimes , as a leader , I have to do things I 'd rather not do . - You get the package ? - Just like they said . - I still don 't trust them . - Hell , no , but we need them to trust us . Ward : Something 's not right . Why isn 't May here ? There 's something Coulson 's not saying . Which is why we should make a run for it . The idea of them wiping away who you are ... Hey , no one 's gonna wipe anything . We have the upper hand . Whatever Coulson 's endgame is doesn 't matter because he is gonna help us get to ours . [ Insects chirping ] What 's this ? Thought we could put that on the windowsill . It 's beautiful . It 's too bad . I liked our house . It won 't be our last ... promise . At the end of this , you 'll be home . And we 'll be together . [ Knock on window ] Deathlok : Break it up . Let 's go . This just gets better and better . - Huh ? - Ward : Not to worry . We are working with Director Coulson . You 're gonna do whatever he says ... understand ? Of course . I 'm more than happy to comply . Get him out of there . [ Knock on door ] [ Sighs ] Hey . Um ... sorry . Uh , I was expecting Gordo . He can 't like you calling him that . [ Chuckles ] Oh , he loves it . Uh , come in . Uh , so , I was , uh , gonna find you today , but , um , I-I didn 't want to overdo it after last night . I-I tend to overdo ... big overdoer . [ Chuckles ] Yeah , I noticed . Oh , so I guess you heard I 'm gonna be out of here for a little bit . - Yeah , I heard . - Hey , you want to put in an order ? I 'll bring you back something from the mainland ... gossip mags , soda pop . Do you like funyuns ? [ Chuckling ] I 'm ... I 'm okay , thank you . So , where are you going ... China ? What makes you think I 'd go there ? No . God , no . Oh , I-I 'm sorry . Jiaying said that you were going home , - so I just assumed that ... that ... - Oh , oh , of course . No , that makes sense . No , I was in China volunteering for doctors without borders . - Wow . - Hard to picture that , right ? I was supposed to be there two weeks , but I met your mother and I couldn 't leave . She stole my heart . No , home is , um , is Milwaukee . That 's where we were gonna bring you up . I should take you there sometime ... I don 't know ... - maybe show you around the old haunts . - Why not tomorrow ? - I want to go with you . - Okay . - Best day ever ! - Yeah . [ Insects chirping ] You can 't just leave him on the side of the road like an unwanted puppy . It 's irresponsible and cruel for both a puppy or Cal , and Cal 's not a puppy ... he 's a pitbull , - a raging pitbull who will attack if he doesn 't ... - I don 't want to hear about the people you think you 're responsible for . This isn 't about them . This is about me . You asked me to be decent ... give Cal one dinner . I did that . - And I ... empathize . - After one night , you understand him ? Yes . Because I spent my entire life searching for you . I lied and I broke laws just to get the ... the tiniest sliver of information . And I had no memories of my family . Cal had memories . He knows what he lost . Listen , I 'm I 'm not asking you to let him stay . Just let me go with him . I 'll talk to him . I 'll soften the blow ... let him know I 'll visit and that ... he hasn 't lost us forever . [ Engine rumbling ] Bakshi reached out ... arranged a meeting with Dr. List . And are we sure we trust stepford Bakshi ? " Trust " might be a little strong . Bakshi 's been instructed to act exactly as he would have ... before . Before the brainwashing . Oh , well , in that case , I feel comforted . - Any questions ? - Kara : How much longer ? Deathlok : A couple hours . [ Sighs ] So , Fitz how 've you been ? - Hey ! - Hey , hey , hey ! Hey , hey , hey ! - Sit down , Agent Fitz . - Hey ! Bakshi , sir . Bakshi ... no , he is ... he is ... he 's the exact same as Ward . So he will double-cross us the second that he 's with HYDRA . Yes , he would ... if he was going in alone . - He 's not ? - He 'll have his bodyguard with him . That 'd be me . We 'll monitor the entire meet through Mike 's eye . Dr. List 's instructions were explicit ... Bakshi was to come alone . Luckily , Bakshi 's good at talking his way out of things . Aren 't you ? I 've been told it 's one of my more useful skill sets , yes . See ? No problem . [ Computer beeping ] [ Keyboard clacking ] - Any luck ? - No . They were going to find out ... you know that . You do realize that it was my plan - to switch the box ... not Fitz 's ? - We had to get out in front of it . I mean , he carried the plan out to perfection , but I handed him the schematics . I don 't care whose plan it was . - You threw Fitz to the wolves ! - To protect you . They raided the base for that box . You 're lucky you 're not in a cell right now . I can 't believe what I 'm hearing . You 're on their side . It 's not about sides ... it 's about the truth . Coulson left us with a mountain of lies , and the only way to understand his reasoning was inside that box . Honestly , I don 't care what 's in it . The only thing I know is that Coulson was just trying to protect Skye . [ Electricity crackles ] Thanks , Gordo . Now beat it . - Cal . - I 'll be back when you 're ready . We 'll let you know . [ Electricity crackles ] Our first father-daughter date ! Though " date " might be the wrong word . Is that weird ? Is ... Is this weird ? Yeah . It 's weird . It 's a little weird . So , did you have an apartment around here or ... ? Oh , I didn 't live here ... worked here . - My office is , uh , over there . - Oh , then where are we going ? I thought you said you had to grab some of your things . No , I told you I wanted to show you around . Thought we 'd get a pastry , get to know each other a little ? - Sure . Who doesn 't love pastry ? - Right ? Oh , there 's this great , little Mom-and-Pop bakery just around the corner ... Swedish place ... Swiss ... I don 't know . I mix them up . What 's wrong ? You know what doesn 't have the smell of buttery goodness - wafting out of it on your way to work ? - A currency exchange ? Got to be someplace to eat around here . So , did you have ... you had a practice here ? - Yeah , before I met your mother . - She was a doctor , too ? Studying to be one . She had a natural gift for it ... compassionate , beyond intelligent , wise ... always five steps ahead of me . She wanted to finish med school here . Oh , and there was this great , little charter school just around the corner . - A charter school for medicine ? - What ? [ Chuckling ] Oh , no , not for her ... for you . Oh , it was gonna be perfect . I was gonna drop you off every morning and pick you up , help you with your science-fair project ... the volcano , because who doesn 't love a volcano , right ? We 'd go to the father-daughter dances together , get ice cream . Ah , the life we could have had ... should have had . I 'm sorry . Memory lane isn 't always that fun to visit . - It 's okay . - Come on . I 've got ice cream on the brain . [ Keyboard clacking ] Fitz : We are online . It 's good to see you alive and well , Mr. Bakshi . Bakshi : Dr. List , a pleasure . You 're a difficult man to find these days . - Please . - Hunter : Three men , heavily armed ... - bet there 's more where they came from . - Does it matter ? You got a cyborg on board with rockets in his arm . He 's not a cyborg ... he 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent ... with rockets in his arm . Our world is much more complicated now after the tragic death of Dr. Whitehall and the ensuing bloodbath that it caused . Thank you . Tell me , Mr. Bakshi , exactly how did you manage to escape unscathed ? - Bakshi : What are you implying , doctor ? - Well , most of HYDRA 's leaders were wiped out in one fell swoop , but not you . I was just curious if you might know anyone involved . Let 's see how Bakshi holds up under questioning . - He 's held up to worse than this . - You think I poisoned the baroness ? - Killed Bloom ? - Someone put a bullet in his head . I assumed it was you ... or Strucker . You had the most to gain , and look ... here you sit , alive and well , with more money and manpower than ever . See ? Told you he was good . The truth is , I didn 't escape unscathed . I was captured by the U.S. government . Mr. Peterson helped me escape . You do recognize him , don 't you ? Well , you should . HYDRA invested quite a bit of funds turning Mr. Peterson into the perfect killing machine ... money well-spent , I might add . - What 's he doing ? - He 's gaining List 's trust . Bakshi : I know Strucker has been experimenting on powered individuals . I believe that with a compliance upgrade , Mr. Peterson would prove quite useful to him . You 're offering him ... - ... to me ? - Consider it a sign of good faith . This wasn 't the plan . What are you doing ? - Getting us to Strucker . - Bastard sold us out ! [ Guns cock ] [ Groans ] - Put the gun down now ... now ! - It was the only way . - I 'm not gonna warn you again . - Will you just listen to me ? ! - Do you want to get to Strucker or not ? - Hunter : Fitz , are you all right ? - [ Strained ] Yeah , I 'm delightful . - Strucker wants powered people . Bakshi alone doesn 't get you to him . Deathlok does , and he can take care of himself ... trust me . Coulson : " Trust me " ? I ought to shoot you just for saying that . - Um , sir . - What if this goes South ? Would you have been willing to sacrifice Mike ? That wasn 't your call to make . - Sir , Deathlok is , um ... - Is that Deathlok 's targeting system ? Yes , he 's gonna ... he 's ... well , he ... - he 's about to kill everyone . - Not a bad idea , actually . No , we need them alive . Fitz , tell Mike to stand down . - Yeah , no , that 's not gonna happen . - Let him go , 33 . My name is Kara , and I don 't work for you anymore . Weapons systems are hot . [ Machinery whirring ] On the count of three , we all put our weapons down . Three ! [ Breathing heavily ] _ [ Machinery whirring ] You pull anything like that again , I 'll throw your ass off this quinjet at 20,000 feet . [ Keyboard clacking ] Doctor , there 's been another incident . Excuse me . We 're close . Put us in the air . And then ... we 'll see quite how loyal you and your enhanced friend really are . - They 're taking off . - If Strucker 's overseas , I 'd say that 's probably where they 're going . Then we tail them . Bookstores ... dead . Video stores ... dead . Old-fashioned ice-cream shops ... dead . The internet killed everything . I 'm not sure the internet killed ice cream , but , uh , how about we get a 40 ounce of malt liquor instead ? - I 'm kidding , sort of . - [ Chuckling ] A-ha ! I learned something about you ... you 're funny . That 's good . - Oh . - Hey . Hey , where are your manners ? Apologize to my daughter . Hey . Hey . Calm down , okay ? I bumped him . Sorry . That was ... that was my bad . Yeah . It 's all cool here . You know what ? I bet they have ice cream . I 'll go see . [ Dialing ] [ Ringing ] - Hello ? - May , it 's Skye . - I need to talk to Coulson . - Skye , where are you ? - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm okay , but I don 't have much time . Where 's Coulson ? He 's out , looking for you . Where have you been ? I 'm with Cal , but I won 't be for long . And when I leave him , he 's gonna be pissed . Okay ? Dangerous . S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to come get him - and make sure he doesn 't hurt anyone . - Skye , slow down . Okay , look , there 's no time to explain . Please , it 's just too complicated . Just don 't hurt him . Skye , where are you ? Skye ? ! - Cal : I got Neapolitan and vanilla . - Uh , you pick . She left the line open for us . We 'll have the location in a minute . - She doesn 't sound like a hostage . - More like she 's playing along . Mack and I can take a team ... go get them . Do it . You 're bored . Am I boring you ? No . You are a lot of [ chuckling ] things , but boring is not one of them . Tell you what ... let 's head over to my old office , okay ? There 's something there I want to show you ... something really special . - Jiaying : Any word from Lincoln ? - Nothing yet . [ Sighs ] They 've been gone a while . I regret letting her go , but at least Lincoln 's there to protect her . Actually , there is something that needs your attention right now . - It 's Ethan . - Ethan ? I thought you dropped him off on a camping trip . I did , but when I went to bring him back , he was gone . I can 't find him anywhere . - Are you saying he 's missing ... or worse ? - I 'm not sure . But ... even if they knew ... who he was , that he was one of us ... how can they get ahold of him ? Right now I 'm not concerned with how as much as who . We 're landing ? Already ? I thought Strucker was in Eastern Europe . He is . But first , we 're making a stop . Have you heard of quantum entanglement , Mr. Bakshi ? No , I 'm afraid not . Well , we at HYDRA , for the last several months , actually ... Quantum entanglement ? Sounds like a method of torture . ... we have found incidents of photon intensity so great that particles can exist simultaneously in two spaces over great distances . Never liked science or big words . But for something to be in two places concurrently ... No , no , no . This is a quantum entanglement bridge . We think it was created by a powered person , one we intend to capture . The teleporter ... they 're tracking the teleporter , the one that , um , took Cal in Wisconsin and ... and Raina . - And Skye . - This is about Skye . Kara : Why would HYDRA want her ? Don 't know . Please , uh , excuse the mess ... and the , uh , the roaches . - Johnson ... is that your last name ? - Was . Pretty ordinary , huh ? [ Lock disengages ] I changed it to something more sinister when I went on the run . Daisy Johnson . Huh . [ Door hinges creak ] - I , um , I had one of these . - Coincidence ? I think not . Genetics . Keep it if you like . - How is all this stuff still here ? - I own the building . You own the building ? Mm-hmm , every wall , every bulb , every cockroach . [ Inhales deeply ] I wasn 't rich , but you would have grown up quite comfortable . Had to shutter everything down after , uh ... well , you know . Only been back a few times over the years . So , this is like your stash pad , where you keep all of your old stuff ? [ Chuckling ] Oh , I like that ... " stash pad . " Makes it sound better than a crappy office . Okay . My grandfather 's field kit from WWII . I used this to put your mother back together again . Truth is , her gift was the real healer . She 's a walking miracle , your mother . The way she suffered and endured and fought through it ... - You still love her . - How could I not ? I mean , I know she resented me for a time after we lost you , but I think now that we 're back together , that we can ... - Please , stop . - What ? What ? What 'd I say ? We 're not all back together . You can 't hang on to the past like this . You need to move on . We all do . Jiaying ... she 's responsible for all those people , and I ... I-I 'm an adult now . And as much as you want to turn back the clock to the time of science fairs and father-daughter dances ... They 're gone , yeah . I know . I know . But , look , it doesn 't mean that we can 't see each other . - I could visit . - Visit ? Where are you going ? [ Door opens ] Who 's there ? Come out where I can see you . Relax . - It 's just me . - Lincoln . What are you doing here ? Jiaying sent me to make sure everything was cool . Why wouldn 't everything be cool ? [ Clank ] What 's going on here ? Wait a minute . Y-You think Daisy isn 't safe with me ? - I didn 't say that . Just calm down . - Don 't patronize me . Who the hell do you think you are ? I 'm her father ! - Fan out . - Alpha team ... If the teleporter is here , we want him alive . 10-4 . Hail HYDRA . - Cal , let me explain . I ... - No . What an idiot I 've been , huh ? I see what 's happening . You were gonna dump me here like yesterday 's trash . You don 't want to spend time with me . This isn 't daddy 's day out . - This is goodbye . - It 's not forever . - It ... it ... - Skye , don 't . - Her name is Daisy ! - Cal ! [ Grunts ] Well , what are you waiting for ? After everything I did for Jiaying , for our family ... years of searching , the pain , and the rejection ! - Cal , I 'm warning you . - Oh , you 're warning me ? Watch out ! [ Electricity crackling ] [ Groaning ] - What 's S.H.I.E.L.D. doing here ? - It 's not S.H.I.E.L.D. , it 's HYDRA . [ Engines rumbling ] [ Footsteps ] [ Guns cock ] Get her out of here . I 'll take care of this . [ Chuckling ] Hey , hey , fellas , huh ? - I can handle myself . - No , don 't use your powers . You could bring the whole building down . - I 'll help hold them off . - Let 's not lose our heads , okay ? [ Grunts ] Just go , please . Sir , Skye ... Skye 's here ! - Where ? - 10th floor . - The Skye who shot you three times ? - Four . [ Gun cocks ] Don 't even think about it . You keep HYDRA off us . I 'll find Skye . Lincoln : Hey . [ Electricity crackling ] [ Groaning ] Aah ! [ Panting ] What are you made of ? Whoever you are , you don 't want to do this . - I 'm a friend of Skye 's . - Sure . And I 'm the Hulk . [ Grunts ] Sir , Deathlok 's down . I 've lost his feed . [ Keyboard clacking ] [ Computer beeping ] Uh . Uh , sir , I think somebody 's trying to hack into it . - We need to split up ! - We 'll cover you . Go find Skye ! Where the hell is your boyfriend going ? - Look out ! - Aah ! [ Groaning ] Skye ? Skye ! Who the hell 's that guy ? [ Groans ] Don 't know . Packs a mean spark . I think he 's protecting Skye . Where is she now ? Can you scan the floor ? [ Tablet beeping ] Got him . Signal 's coming in . Deathlok : Optics are down . I think she went around that corner . Bloody hell . [ Groans ] [ Groans ] Deathlok : Stay down , kid . I got this . Where the hell you been ? You missed all the fun . Not quite . Take them both . [ Weapon powers up ] [ Clanging ] [ Pulsing ] [ Whirring ] [ Grunting ] - Skye ? - Coulson ? [ Electricity crackles ] - I need to get you out of here . - No , no , not yet , no ! No , don 't go ! [ Grunts ] I had her . Damn it ! I had her . [ Gunshot ] Deathlok 's down . We 've got powered people on-site . HYDRA 's storming the building . - What happened to you ? - Ah , it 's merely a flesh wound . A bad one . We 're outmanned , outgunned , and our only backup is Fitz . Your call , boss . Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . Standard HYDRA issue . I 'd say we missed them by less than an hour . Hell of a fight , though . Looks like everyone cleared out . Coulson : Not everyone . I doubled back after HYDRA took off . Their cleanup crew really sucks , doesn 't it ? What the hell happened here , Coulson ? I 'll tell you all about it back at the base . Take me to your leader .

 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha - Seven billion people were killed in the last Great War . Not all at once , though . It takes time to wipe out an entire species . We are the survivors . Some say we were the lucky ones . But when I was a kid , My mother used to tell me stories about what life was like back then , before the radiation , before the plague , before the drought . At first , I didn 't believe her . It all sounded too good to be true , like some sort of crazy fairy tale that spun horribly out of control . Now that there only are few of us left , something has become clear to me .. We have a choice . We can either carve out a new future for ourselves on the tombstone of this dying planet , or go back to that fairy tale . And try again . - Are you folks lost ? - Is this the way to get to Piccadilly Circus ? - You 're too late . They 've run out of Blackbird pie . - Well , I guess we 'll have to come back yesterday , before they 're all gone . - Welcome to The Domes . - Thank you . Agent Higgs is expecting us . - Higgs , you got some visitors . - Where have you been ? You 're late . - They 've all set up road blocks . We had to take the not so scenic route . If we hurry we can still make it into the jump window . - Let me get your identification , OK ? Stand still . - Agent Lancer . Identity confirmed . Agent Seattle . Identity confirmed . - OK , follow me . Now , this is your first jump , right ? Yes . - OK . We don 't have time for a complete debriefing , Now , you 're familiar with the NCNG protocol , I hope ? - " Nothing comes nothing goes . " - That 's good , that 's good . Now , a few pointers . Keep your interactions with the locals to a minimum . That will help maintain your cover . - Got it . - Some changes are to be expected . It 's part of the territory . As long your results are net positive , you can consider your mission to be a success . - Have others failed ? - We 're all still here , aren 't we ? Watch your step . The first jump can be a little disorienting . It might take a while for you to get acclimated to your new skin . Some agents experience paranoia , delusions , psychosis . Others , once they go into stasis they never wake up . Lucky for you , we 've worked out those bugs . Well , most of them . Secure your weapons up here . Right up here . Put your personal belongings in these baskets . Then put the baskets back in the rack . You can retrieve them when you come out of stasis . There is a wash bin right here . Wash up when you 're done . - Have you ever done this before ? Jump , I mean . - Well , we 're all required to log 500 hours before we 're certified , so yes . - Any advice tor first timers ? Well ... Have you ever had those dreams where you know you 're asleep , but everyone else around you thinks it 's real ? Just remember who 's awake . Who 's first ? I 'll go . - OK . - Don 't be a stranger . - Let 's go . - See you on the other side . - Right here . - Are you ready ? - Bring it - OK . Seriously , Ava ? Again ? It 's the third time this year ! - School is overrated . - We need to talk ! - Why start now ? - Do you think I like living like this ? Can 't you see that I 'm trying , Ava ? I 'm doing the best that I can . - It 's not my fault you screwed up your own life and it doesn 't mean you get to relive it through me . - It never ends with you , does it ? - I guess not . - Why are you so angry ? Whatever happened to my little girl ? I miss her . - You 'll get over it . - You ungrateful little brat ! - Oh , real nice . I was going to let you go out and have fun tonight , but instead you 're gonna stay here and you 're gonna clean up this pig sty ! - Hey ! Nice outfit . You look amazing . Thanks , so do you . Do you think Matt will like it ? Uh , he 's male and has a pulse . What do you think ? - OK , good . I think you know , we might ... - No way . - Yeah . - You little slut ! - I know . - Where are you gonna do it ? I don 't know . I haven 't planned the play-by-play . You know , I just figured see how things work out . - I will drink to that . I know what you need . A little something to take the edge off . Just a few , or will not remember a thing , and I 'm gonna want to know all the juicy details . Well , you 're not the only one who wants to have fun today . - Hey . - Hi . - Wow , you 're looking hot tonight . - So are you . - Come on , I want to show you something . - What ? I got your beanie ! " You think you 're so funny , don 't you ? " - I got you . - Here , give it back . - No . Come on . It 's much better this way . You 've had enough . - This is mine . Come here . - I don 't feel good . I seriously don 't feel good . - I 've got something that will make you feel better . - Shit . Ava ! Ava ! You 've had enough . - I will drink to that . You ungrateful little brat ! - Real nice . - My god , Ava . - Ava ? " - Shit ! What happened ? - I don 't know . She was fine a few seconds ago . - My God . - Shit . - My God . Ava . - My God . - Somebody call 911 ! - Matt ? Circe ? Where is everyone ? Ow . Mom ! Let me in . - What now ? Look , alright , I don 't need a lecture .. You know there is someone in the house and ... Just let me in , okay ? - What 's the matter ? - She 's right there . She 's right there . - I thought I heard something at the door . - You need to get her out ! No , no , no . - It better not be not one of your idiot friends . - Can you not see me ? - Some of us have to work in the morning . - I don 't know who you think you are ! - Hello ? Is anyone there ? - Yeah - Alright . - Come on , Lancer . Where are you ? - Get out of here ! I said get out ! - Lancer ? Is that you ? Who did that ? Did you miss your jump ? - Why wasn 't I been informed of this breach sooner ? - It was not necessarily a breach per Se . They boys in engineering detected a slight protuberance on the continuum . They assured me it was just a glitch . - Well , tell them not to think too hard . They might hurt themselves . Jeez . Are you a gambling man , Brewer ? No . - Hmm , " no " . You clearly lack the intestinal fortitude . Well , I am . And I 'll bet anything that the rebels have moved their stasis chambers underground to hide electromagnetic footprint .. So , it 's time you stop wasting time chasing imaginary glitches and tell your boys in engineering to track down their point of origin ! - Sir , that signal was very faint . Barely a blip on our scanners . Even if there were a time jump , the rebels couldn 't have gone very far . - I do not care if they went back five years or five minutes . A jump causes ripples . And ripples have consequences . Sometimes I wish time travel had never been invented . It 's more trouble than it 's worth . We 've got rebels popping up of every goddamned time stream . They 're like ticks . And once they 're dug into a time zone , it is impossible to root them out . - On the plus note , last month alone , We 've cleared out rebel bases both in 97 Hong Kong and pre-9 / 11 New York . - Congratulations , that 's two . How many others are out there disturbing the time stream now ? - We 're working on that . - Well , work faster ! And if you encounter any more ... glitches , notify me immediately . - Of course , sir . Prize truth . - Seek Harmony . - Oh , look at all this food . - Oh , god , what drugs did I take last night ? - Someone 's up early . Oh , I 'm sorry , here , um ... let me clean this up . Do you want any of this ? - No , I ... I 'm good . - Oh , OK . - Hey , need to talk to you about last night . - Oh , about like the door bell ? No , before that . Listen , I didn 't mean to call you a brat . - Oh , um ... yeah . I 'm sure we both said things we didn 't mean . - That 's mature of you . - Yeah , I mean , at the end of the day we 're still family , right ? - Yeah , we are . - Oh , for Christ 's sakes . I can 't believe you 're falling for this . - Listen , I gotta go to work , but we 'll talk later ? - OK , Yeah , bye . ( thinking ) I don 't know how long I can keep this up . - Finally ! - Hey , Ava ! Come on , babe , get in the car , I want to talk to you ! - I have somewhere else to be . - Let me take you ! - I prefer walking . - Oh , don 't be mad . Look , I 'm sorry , alright ? Alright ? I was wasted all night . I get it ; I shouldn 't have left , I 'm sorry . - You know , I ... don 't really want to discuss this . - Look , I said I was sorry , what more do you want from me ? - I want you to keep on driving . - You can 't get rid of me that easily . - Look , let me put this blunt to you , guy . Stay away . I never want to see you again ever . - Fine ! If that 's the way you want to be about it . - It is ! - No , Matt ! Don 't listen to her ! How did I get in here ? Why can 't you see me ? Look , I don 't know what 's going on , I 'm gonna try to find out how to make it right . - Don 't be a stranger . Excuse me , do you know the way to the Piccadilly Circus ? Too late . They 've run out of Blackbird pie . - My God ! It is you . - Hi , Lancer . Surprise ! Wow , you hit the jackpot . Where did you find that vessel ? - At some sort of fraternity hazing ritual , gone south . you know , and I thought my vessel was young . - Yeah , I know , drug overdose . Can you believe ? - I 'm sorry . I mean ... that 's actually sad , poor kid . - Yeah . So , what are you gonna do ? I don 't know , I can 't just leave . Because the kid would be gone , and the mom will come searching for me . - And create a bunch of unwanted attention . Exactly . You know HQ needs to really work in refining the jump system . I know selections are limited . But this ? This is ridiculous . - Maybe somebody at base camp will have some ideas . Hmm ? - Yeah . - We should probably go check in . - Yes let 's go . - You folks lost or something ? - Uh , is ... is this the way to Piccadilly Circus ? - You 're too late . We 're done run out of Blackbird pie . - We 'll come back yesterday , before they 're all gone . - You must be new , I don 't recognize those skins . - Agent Lancer . - Agent Seattle . - Agent Derby . Welcome to our little corner of paradise . - Um , we 've seen worse . - Don 't get me wrong . It 's better than being Uptime . But I heard that the Pacific unit is in a mansion in Bel Air . Bel Air ! Whose ass do you have to kiss to get that assignment ? We should put this on the list for the next jump .. - Let 's get through this one first . - Oh , you got stuck with a kid , huh ? Too bad . You should ask the captain for a new skin . - You can do that ? - Well , let me tell you , I 've seen some really bad jumps over the years . One vessel was decapitated in a car accident . That was messy - OK , I get it . - See ? The kid thing is sounding better and better all the time . - Wanna trade ? - No , thanks . - Agent Seattle ? Agent Lancer . - Sir . - I 'm Captain Suthers . Thank you for making the jump on such short notice . We 're happy to help . How is the 21st century treating you so far ? - I can 't complain , the air is clean . - Oh , have you tried orange juice ? It 's amazing . - Enjoy it while it lasts . Come on , I 'll give you the Nickel tour . While some other stations are more of your typical bang and burn operation , our emphasis is on executive action . - What is this place ? - This will give you a sense of what we 're up against . - Whoa . - Jesus , I didn 't realize that Cabal had so many operatives in this timezone They haven 't consolidated their power structures yet . They 're still hindered by national boundaries , which makes it easier for us to cut their legs off from under them . You aren 't afraid of getting your hands dirty , are you ? - Not at all . - Good . - Who are you people ? - HQ knows we can 't compete with the Cabal Uptime . They are bigger than us and have unlimited resources . But here downtime , it 's a level playing field . Isn 't that right ? - Whoa ! What have I said about the sneaking and the touching ? This vessel is very sensitive . - Agent Paseo will get you started with the data dump . - The process itself is painless , But it will give a hell of a migraine . - Oh , oh , Captain , if it 's not too much to ask , the guard mentioned the possibility of getting a replacement vessel ? This is too young for field work . - Especially if the two of you are gonna be working together . We don 't want to raise too many questions . - Hmm-hm . - Wait , So does that mean I can I get my body back ? I 'll put in a transfer request . - Oh , thank you sir . - What ? So , but wait , how long id it for a replacement ? Are you talking hours ? Days ? - Ladies first . I 'm just gonna do a quick memory scan . See what kind of goodies you brought back . Here we go . Alright . There we go . Hopefully you 'll do better than the last jumper , who apparently had a thing for cat videos . I 'm more of a dog lover myself . Right . Alright now we 're cooking with main power . OK . Ooh .. Hello , gorgeous . Where have you been all my life ? - I really wish you could hear me ! - Nightingale . I have a new broadcast for you . - Right away , captain . 17 . 54 . 7 . 95 . 28 . 43 . - I intercepted an incoming rebel transmission . Sending it now . - 29 . 35 . 54 . 7 . - What is it ? - Coordinates , American Southwest . Early 21st century , right Before the last world war . - What do we know about this timezone ? " - It matches the rebels ' profile , alright . Accidents , suicides , suspicious deaths . - How did we miss this cluster ? - All the victims were low-level players , sir . No one of any real significance . - Damn it , we don 't know that ! 50 years ago , we were all young officers ! Hell I could be on their list ! Or you . And nobody around here would notice our absence . Sir , do you know how difficult it is to monitor all of downtime ? The past is a big place . And it 's about to get a lot smaller . Send in the hunter . - Hunter Alpha Charlie 42 , report to the stasis chambers immediately . - Deputy Minister , I didn 't expect to see you here . Where is the usual jump technician ? - I gave him the day off . Come in . There 's something I wanted to show you personally . - It doesn 't look like much . - Don 't be so dismissive The design was kept intentionally simple to avoid suspicion from local authorities authorities . Trust me . It packs one hell of a punch . - What is it ? - Something new . We want you to beta est it out on the field . All of this is top secret , of course . - I can keep a secret . - Good . - I like it , the rebels will never know what hit them . - That is the idea . Can you recreate it downtime ? - Oh yeah . - Are you ready ? - Let 's go kill us some Skinners . - Prize truth . - Seek Harmony . I guess this vessel will do . - Hey Y 'alls , Be right careful out there . You hear ? - How 's your head ? - It feels like Paseo just split it open with a jackhammer . and filled it back in with concrete . - I don 't remember the recruiter mentioning this part . " Be a temporal agent , " He said , " change the world . " He said . - Maybe we were out sick that day . We were out sick a lot . - That was my favorite part of training . - Mine too . - Nice night for a walk . - This is my favorite part of the city . It was better before the Skinners moved in . - You are in violation of temporal ordnance 19.8-4 , time-travel with the intent of changing the future . How do you plead ? - We will destroy the Cabal before it even begins . - Guilty it is . - What are you going to do ? Shoot me ? If you kill this vessel , I 'll just come back in a new skin . - That was the old way , it was kind of like playing " Whack-a mole " back then . We do not play that game anymore . See you Uptime . Skinner . Poor little Skinner has no skin . How does she keep her insides in ? I 'd like to report a vermin infestation . Please send someone to this location at your earliest convenience . - The fugitive is in custody , ready for interrogation . - What is it , Brewer ? - The test was a success . We have one of the rebels in custody . - Excellent . - Yes , sir . We are bringing him in for interrogation now . - I don 't like you staying here . You are too exposed . - I 'll be fine . The mom 's harmless and the boyfriend 's just ... - Boyfriend ? Do I need to take care of it ? - Already did . What ? - Nothing . - You can 't fool me , no matter what skin you 're in . Something 's bothering you . - It 's just ... it 's only been a day . That new vessel can 't come soon enough . - We only have to wait a couple of weeks . - I 'll be by in the morning to pick you up , OK ? - Alright , it 's a date . - This sucks . I can 't ... It 's working . Is it you , Ava ? - You 're still here , aren 't you ? I do not know how much you can understand , but just know that this is a part of something big . An I wouldn 't be here if it wasn 't really important . I 'm Sorry . I 'm so sorry that you 're dead . - I 'm not dead ! I 'm gonna find a way to get back ! - Hey , Ava ! - I don 't have time for this . - You literally just told me you love me and now you 're blowing me off ? What 's gong on with you ? Ever since that party you 've been acting weird . - Then move on , good talking to you . - Is he bothering you ? - No , He 's just leaving . - And who is this guy ? - Listen , Junior . You should know when a lady 's not interested , right ? Hit the bricks . - Lancer , knock it off . " - Lancer ? OK . You need to make a choice right now . It 's either him or it 's me . - Don 't ever give a girl an ultimatum . Let 's go . Alright , what is it ? - I don 't like that guy . - He 's a kid , he 's harmless . - He 's trouble . - You 're jealous . - I saw the way he looked at you . It 's only temporary , okay ? Stay focused . Let 's do what we came here to do . - Do either of you know what this is or what it 's supposed to do ? No . We just intercepted an encrypted transmission . - The Cabal used a 256-bit key cipher . So , whatever that thing does , they don 't want it to become public knowledge . - Well , it 's clearly intended to be used downtime . - How can you tell ? - The design is simple enough that a single hunter could memorize it . And the components are all readily available in this timezone . The only tricky part is this magnetron . But those are available in any microwave oven . - So you can actually build this ? - In for doodles . - Does anyone doubt ? - I think that means yes . Whole shit in the woods ? If a tree falls in the woods , do leprechauns come out of my butt ? - Has anyone heard from agent Nightingale ? It 's unusual for her to not check in . - I love technology . Do you remember how hard it was questioning rebels in the old days ? It took a long drawn out process . Starvation , sleep deprivation , beatings , torture ... And even then , the Intel was usually used to be wrong . This is so much more efficient . - I do miss the screams , though . Just not the same without them . - Aha ! There they are ! You see how simple that was ? Well , it was nice working with you , my dear , but your services are no longer needed . Well , let 's go pay a visit to our rebel friends . - Oh no ! - Suthers speaking . Are you sure it 's her ? Yeah . Yeah . Thank you for letting me know . Some time last night , Agent Nightingale was attacked . Her empty vessel was found in an alley . Here . - Was it random ? - Nothing was stolen and there is no sign of trauma . We have reason to believe that cabal has anew hunter operating in this timezone . As of right now , our number one priority is to find and eliminate this hunter . We need to retrace Nightingale 's final steps . I want footage from every cameras in a two-block radius . This hunter has a face , By the end of today I want it plastered up on that wall for everyone to see . And by tomorrow , I want it covered with a big red X. Am I understood ? - Sir , yes , sir ! - We will send the Cabal a message : " We are armed , we 're trained and we are ready ! " Now let 's go find this asshole and bring them down ! - Yeah ! - We might have one small problem . - What is it , Paseo ? - Cabal has a new toy , and it 's nasty . - This tech is so primitive . How are we supposed to ID anybody with this ? What do you think happens to our vessels receptacles when they die ? To their spirit , I mean . - I don 't ... I don 't know . I mean , we are all made of energy . When it gets released , it goes back into the cosmos , I suppose ? Or were you looking for a more heaven and hell , " Is there life after death ? " kind of answer ? - I don 't know , but ... You can 't tell anyone , but I think my new skin is a remnant . - What would make you say that ? - I 've seen things , like messages on my computer screen , and ... - Do not let that kind of talk get out . It 's dangerous . - Do you think I don 't know that ? At first , I thought I was being paranoid or delusional you know , first jump stuff , but now I don 't know . I think it was a premature jump . Shit ! You mean she wasn 't dead yet ? - I don 't know , maybe . Why else would she be here ? - You know that remnants can 't officially exist . " - Yeah , but if she wasn 't dead yet ... " - So if the girl is a remnant , that means that somebody at headquarters messed up big time . But they will never admit that . They will pin it on you first . - Do you think they 'll ground me ? - Um-hmm . And then we will never see each other again . Do you understand ? So , before you go telling anybody else just wait . You know , maybe ... maybe you 'll feel different in a new skin . - I hope so . Captain ! We found a match . - Zoom in . I want to see what this son of a bitch looks like . Well , I 'll be damned . - Hello , Matthew . Ava is not here . - Actually , I 'm here to see you . - Me ? - Yes , ma 'am . There 's something about Ava that , as her mother , I think you ought to know . - So this thing is like a prison for souls ? - In a nutshell , yes . How do we stop it ? Well , we don 't . Not yet , anyway . There 's a problem with the prototype , there 's a flaw with the compact symmetries and compilers . - Have you tried to reverse the polarity ? - I need to go back through the data dump and see if there 's something that I 'm missing . - Um , so what are we gonna do about the hunter ? - My advice ? Stay away . - Why are you doing this ? Come on , it 's too dangerous . You 're better off staying at my place . - And risk you going to jail , for kidnapping or even worse ? No - There 's a hunter on the streets , - Then I 'll stay off the streets . - I can 't lose you . - Don 't worry.the second my new transfer comes in , I 'll be at your door , with my bags packed Until then , this is our best option . - Who was that ? - A friend . - You know it 's not health for a grown man to be hanging around with a 15 year old . - OK , mother . - Are you dealing drugs ? - Jesus , no . Did you have sex with him ? I 'm not having this conversation right now . - Was that Lancer ? - How did you know his name ? I saw your chat messages . - You were in my room ? - You were in my room ? - I don 't want you seeing him anymore . - I told you . I 'm not talking about this right now . - This isn 't a game , Ava ! You think that he loves you , and that he 's gonna take care of you and you 're gonna live happily ever after ? Wake up ! This is reality . You 're gonna wake up one day my age , and have a teenager that hates you because you are never there for her . Then , to punish you , you 'll keep making the same mistakes . The same mistakes that I did . It 's like watching your own failures over and over again and there isn 't a damn thing you can do about it . - I am not a failure . - I am not a failure . - So , it looks like someone is scheduled for a replacement . Oh , shit ! - Move , move ! Go back ! I 'll cover you ! Go ! - Hey ! - I 've located the rebel sleepers . Notify the Chief Minister . The vermin has been exterminated . What 's the matter ? - Baby ? Baby , what 's wrong ? - It hurts . - Hold on . I 'm gonna take you to the Emergency Room . - No ! No doctors . - You need help , you 're sick . - No ! I 'll be OK . I 'm OK , see ? I 'm sorry I woke you up . - I didn 't mean what I said earlier . - You 're not a failure . You 're my daughter and I love you very much . - I love you , too . - I love you . " Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as the night . And when you move , fall like a thunderbolt . " Did you ever read Sun Tzu , The Art of War ? written in the 5th century BC ? The greatest military treatise ever written . - I can 't say That I have . - Well , maybe now you won 't have to . " We 've finally reached the brink of peace . - What is going on there ? - Say something ! - Say something ! - Everyone , please ! Just calm down . This isn 't helping . The details are sketchy but there was an attack on base uptime / - What about the stasis chamber ? - Destroyed . - And the sleepers ? - You already know that answer . - So you are saying we are trapped in this timezone ? - For the foreseeable future . I don 't expect reinforcements to arrive any time soon , or exchange them . Yes , this is a setback , I 'm not gonna lie . But it doesn 't change our mission . This latest act of aggression is proof we 're a threat . The Cabal know we have the power to change the future , to rewrite them out of history . And that 's exactly what we 're going to do . Tomorrow we will mourn , but today we are going to go back to our work stations and find a way to take these bastards out . Now let 's go do it ! - Yeah ! - Hey , where are you going ? I need some air . - Get that prototype working ASAP . We 're gonna need all the help we can get . - Seattle ! - Everything alright ? - I 'm OK , I just need a minute . - We can leave , right now , just you and me . - And go where ? You heard the Captain . We 're trapped . - We will start a new life , away from the Cabal and away from the Huntress . - And abandon the mission ? - Think about it . - If the mission was actually successful , if the Cabal never existed , There would have no reason to send us back to this timezone in the first place . - What are you saying ? - The rebellion failed . It always fails , it has to , or else we wouldn 't be here . - No , no , no ... Has to be another way to change things . Otherwise it 's pointless . - If we leave right now , we might have a chance . - A chance to do what ? Stand back and watch history repeat itself ? You and I both know how this story goes and it doesn 't have a good ending . And I 'm gonna give it one . - Seattle . Seattle , wait ! Shit . - Troubles with your lady friend ? - It 's complicated . - Ain 't nothing complicated about love . It 's either you do or you don 't . It don 't get much simpler than that . But life , on the other hand , now that will trip you up every time . - Yeah ? So what do you do when life gets in the way of love ? Huh ? - Sometimes life makes our choices - for us . - Hey , it 's OK . - I just don 't get it . I thought things were going so good between us , you know ? - Matt ? Circe ? - I know , she blew us both off . - Something changed . I can 't help but think about the last time I saw her and She just wasn 't herself . I know how to get you to stop thinking about her . - What ? - You bitch ! Do not stand at my grave and weep . I am not there , I do not sleep , I am the thousand winds that blow . I am the diamond that glints in the snow . I am the sunlight of ripened grain , I am the gentle autumn rain . When you awaken with morning 's hush , I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds and circled fire . I am the soft stars that shine at night . Do not stand at my grave and cry . I am not there , I did not die . - We can 't compete with the Cabal Uptime . They are bigger than us and have unlimited resources . If you 're not gonna help me , I 'll find someone who will . You . Hunter . - I found you . - You 're not a Skinner . What are you ? This ? Do you know where they are ? Can you take me to them ? - Are you lost ? - No . I 'm right where I need to be . - Paseo , how are we coming on that prototype ? Hide ! - Captain , are you OK ? Hunter ! - Hey , who turned out the lights ? - Sir ! - Shit ! Oh , double shit ! - It 's clean . The bullet passed all the way through . - That 's our lucky day . - We 're gonna need to apply pressure to keep it from bleeding . - Paseo , what is that ? - A polymorphic virus . If the Cabal tries to access our data , it will wipe the servers and take us out with it . - How long does that take ? - Longer than we probably have . OK , OK . You 'll keep this safe , won 't you ? - Nipper doodles . - Go . I 'll distract her . - Sad little Skinner , all alone . Time to fly away . Fly away . Fly away home . - Maybe he got her ? - Let 's go . - There is a whole nest of vermin at this location . Please send someone to clean them up . - Oh my God . - How does it look ? - You 'll live . - What is he doing in here ? - It 's not what it looks like . If you would just let me explain ... - Whose blood is this ? - He was shot . - Uh-uh , I 'm calling the cops on this one . - No cops . On your knees . - Ava , I don 't even know who you are anymore . Keep an eye on her , I 'm gonna go find some rope . - You destroyed her life ! - it 's not as simple as all that . If you are looking for your skin , remnant , it 's not here . Unless you know where the skinner is who took it , I 'm afraid there 's not much I can do to help . - Home . - Sorry about this , it would take me too long to explain . And you would not believe me anyway . - Jesus , mom ! What did you do ? You 're gonna regret this , Hunter . - Look who 's back . Did you find your missing skin ? Are you sure that 's where they are ? Good job , kiddo . - There has to be other operatives in other time zones . - Didn 't Derby say something about a Pacific unit ? - Right , in Bel Air . We just have to find them . - But how ? - Maybe something in here will help . What 's going on ? - It 's Ava . - She 's here ? - No , no , no . - We need to go.Right now . - No , you can 't go . You 're hurt . You need to rest . - Showtime . - What are you doing ? - She needs to know . - We 're not supposed to share knowledge of future events . - Or what ? What have we got to lose ? - This is a really bad idea . Think about what you are doing . - Ava , I hope you 're watching this . Take a good look because I want you to remember all of it . This is the future that you created . You did this . By helping the Cabal , you 've just signed a death sentence for the whole world . - I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . - Oh Shit .

Isn 't this what you want ? To get back what she stole from you ? - She didn 't steal it . I threw it away . - Do you know what this is ? It will work on you just as well as Skinners . - You 're a Skinner , too . - No ! Seattle ... Seattle ? Seattle . - Seattle . - No , I 'm Ava . - What ? What ? You can see me ?

Tell me you know how to save her . Huh ? Say it ! Say it , or I 'll slit your throat right here and now . - Do you know the way to Piccadilly Circus ? - What ? What ? - You 're supposed to say ' We 've run out of blackbird pie . ' Seattle ? Seattle ... - Com on , lets patch you up . - I know this is not gonna really make up for anything , but just trust me when I say things will be better now . And I 'm sorry . - Come here , honey , give me a hug . - Why are you keeping that ? - " Keep your friends close but your enemies closer " . What ? - Nothing . It 's just ... It 's a little weird .

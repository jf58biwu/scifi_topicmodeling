 { \ pos ( 221.691,96.4 ) } 12 : 5 Couldn 't sleep ? No . Me neither . Is the room okay ? I 'm gonna find a way to pay you back . Don 't worry about it . Feel like a drive ? Where to ? Suspicious , aren 't you ? Drove it on the way in . Yeah , you don 't get sunrises like this back in Manhattan . No . Not really a ' Sun Rise Dinner ' , is it ? I guess not . I do have one question for you . What 's that ? Is there a mister Trudy ? There 's a Frank . Is he your husband ? That 's two questions . My turn . What 's a guy like you doing driving a truck ? Ask me something else . I 'm just following my father 's footsteps . What would you like to do ? That 's two questions . What do you mean ? With your life . If you could do anything . But I can 't . Come on . Honestly ? Yeah . Just about anything else . Thanks for the sunrise . Where are you going ? To pay you back . Wish me luck . Good morning . You wanna eat ? You gotta pay first . Sign on the window says you need a waitress . You planning on staying here ? I don 't know . But I could use a job . I 'll think about it . What 's there to think about ? You got a job and I need one . Let 's all play , Guess My Game . Mr Blake , a call came in for you . When ? Two minutes ago . No message . Dorothy Dickson . Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . I normally don 't introduce anyone who 's shorter than me . Can you bring the baby in , please , Amy ? Yes , mommy . Okay , thank you . Which way did the knives go , Jenny ? So , what shall we do afterschool today ? Morning , mother . Morning , Thomas . Good morning . Coffee ? Thank you . We all ready for the day ahead ? - Yes , father . - Yes , father . Yes , papa . Then why is your textbook open at the breakfast table , Thomas ? Sorry , father . I have a test today . Did you study last night ? I did . It 's just ... there 's this boy , Randolph . I don 't want him to get the high score . Competition is healthy . He 's ... so annoying . He wears his hair passes the collar , challenges teachers in class . Conformist . He 's proud of it . He makes negative comments about the school all the time . Why do you want to succeed , son ? Why do you want to do well in school ? To make my family proud . Bring honor to my school . To serve my country . See , your goals are directed outwards . And boy like Randolph , wants only to gratified himself , and this is the path to moral decay . The decadences ruined this country before the war . You will grow to be a useful member of society , make our nation stronger . Randolph will not , whatever his test score . Your father is a wise man , son . You may study at the breakfast table , Thomas , just this morning . Thank you , father . Excuse me . Yes . You called ? Where were you , Joe ? I ... couldn 't sleep . Went for a drive . Has your contact approached you ? No , not yet . He must be assessing you . Make sure you 're not a nazi agent . We receive intelligence this morning , we believe a carrier 's carrying some cargo from San Francisco . Okay , what 's his name ? It 's a woman . Not a man . Now , we don 't know if she is headed to Canon City . But you 're to report in immediately if you see her . Is she carrying a film , too ? Who said you 're carrying a film ? I checked the cargo , I want to make sure it was safe . Joe . Those weren 't your orders . I 'm sorry , sir . But what 's so important about a film ? It 's not your place to ask questions , Joe . Satisfy yourself with following orders , understand ? Yes , Obergruppenfuhrer . You 're performing a great service for the fatherland . Heil Hitler . No . No . Why aren 't you circumcised , Mr Frink ? Why would I be ? We examined the record , your grandfather ... My grandmother was Christian . So were my mother and father . Jews don 't get to decide if they are Jews . Not that I care . There are no Jews in Japan , after all . But our racial laws now align with the Reich , so ... it 's not just you who should be exterminated , but also your sister Laura and her children , too . You can 't . The law is the law . Please . Please . I 'm begging you , please . Please , please . I could overlook this , if you cooperate fully . Yeah . Yeah . All right , all right . What is it you want ? You know what I want . The film . Trudy Walker give it to your girlfriend , who has now fleed . Where is Juliana Crain ? Miss . Miss . Here you go . What are you reading ? You don 't know what this is ? Should I ? It 's Bible . Haven 't seen one of those since I was a little girl . Take a look . Lighter than I remember . King James translation . He prefer small print . Those are forbidden in the Pacific States . They 're right to . How did you get it ? You can find a lot of interesting things in the Neutral Zone . Don 't you think ? Japanese women aren 't even a bit scared they those steel monster though they were beating up their husband ... Do something , do something . That 's what I do , maybe I could do something . Sure . It was 9 : 17 a.m. , Monday the 4th of October . Detectives Forman and Decker are investigating for the Reich Police . 4000 marks has been reported missing from the payroll of the 123 Street Agricultural Trust . How can I help you detective ? I 'm just getting ready for work . Have you keep this drawer locked ma 'am ? I see , how silly of me , just about anyone has access to it . Yes , ma 'am . But who would do such a thing ? Stealing money from the Trust that 's like stealing from the Reich itself ? We are grateful to you for agreeing to this meeting . We want to ensure nothing disrupts the visit of the crown prince and princess tommorrow . I believe everything 's in hand . What is your concern , embassador ? We understand you 've arrested suspects , smuggling subversive films , ones produced by this so-called Man in the High Castle before his death . We 've heard rumors the Man in the High Castle is still alive . No , he 's dead . We 've known for some months . We understand a fourth suspect fleed with the film they were smuggling . A woman . You seemed very well informed , Oberfeuhrer Diels . What else do you wish to know ? We assume she fleed to the Neutral Zone ? We need to know where , precisely . We are making inquirys . The Fuhrer has decreed these film be confiscated . Let me speak plainly , Tagomi Sang . If you don 't find this woman , we will . Duly acknowledged , embassador . But , respectfully , gentlemen , please beware , you 're on Japanese soil . We recognize the sovereignty as a Pacific States , Minister . But this is a matter of state security . Good day , gentlemen . Check please . 3 marks . Here you go . You know what I was reading just now ? The Book of the Ecclesiastes . Oh , yeah ? It says , all life under the sun is futile , pointless . So we should dedicate our life to what 's beyond the sun . Sounds interesting . What 's beyond the sun ? The Japanese say it 's the emperor himself . Beyond which , there 's only duty to one 's country . Self-sacrifice . And the nazis ? They say there 's nothing at all . What do you say ? Chapter 12 , Verse 5 . You can pick up a copy in the book store . You spoke to Joe Blake this morning ? I did . He should 've been contacted by now . It appears his contact is being cautious . You don 't think they suspect him ? Well , they suspect everyone . Steady , Erich . The bigger the fish , the greater the patience to catch him . This so-called Man in the High Castle . Mr Goebbels says that not even Fräulein could make films of such sophistication . If he made them . I don 't understand , if he didn 't , who did ? I 've heard strange rumors . Rumors ? The Fuhrer considers the films are threat to very existence of the Reich . That 's why he 's so obsess with them . Preposterous , isn 't it ? The Fuhrer is not inclined to idle obsessions . Go , down . Did we get him ? I need more rounds . Shit . Hey , Ed . Mr , sir . Good morning , Ed . How 's your grandfather ? He 's fine sir , thank you . I should have two more cases over here . What can I help you with ? It 's Frank Frink , sir . I was wandering if he 's phoned in sick today ? No , he hasn 't . It 's just that ... his phone isn 't pick up . Mind if I check and see if he 's okay ? You can duck my pay , of course . - Go on . - Thank you , sir . And don 't worry , I will . Frank . Frank , is that your name ? Over here . It 's okay , I 'm a friend . I gave that film to Trudy Walker . Then you 're definitely not a friend . You gotta tell them I got nothing to do with this . I 'd save you if I could . But I can 't . Who are you ? I 'm just like you , a man who wants to breath freedom ... Spare me the propaganda bullshit , all right ? I meant your name . Randall . Well , Randall , I don 't want your type of freedom I don 't want anything . Takes a lot of effort , not to be afraid . Keeping your head down , holding your tongue . I 'm all for keeping my head down . My mouth shut . As long as I get to live . There things worth more than your life and you know it . You know where Trudy 's sister went , don 't you . What do you know about that ? The question is , what do you know . Yeah , you know where she went . Why don 't you tell them ? They 'd kill me anyway . Oh , maybe . Why don 't you tell them ? And see what happens . That is if you can believe they 'll keep their words . Hey , can I take a break ? 10 minutes . Thank you . Hello . Hello . I 'm looking for a Bible . The Bible ? Old Testament , please . King James translation . What makes you think I have one of those ? Someone told me you did . It 's not like they 're illegal or anything , right ? No laws around here . They may not be illegal , but ... that doesn 't exactly make them legal . If you know what I mean . Of course . Do you have one ? Please . 7 marks . Thank you . Go , go , go . How 's Erich ? He 's in critical condition . One of the bullets lodged only two inches from his heart . I 'm afraid I 've more bad news , sir . Don 't be coy , Laurance . It 's Oberführer Lauze , his vehicle 's gone missing . Missing when ? Last seen crossing the Bridge at 8 : 41 . No sign of him or his driver . These are coordinated attacks . Reprisals of the Resistance leader we killed . What about the man I apprehended ? The Semite , sir , known as ' Doc ' , born Jason Mayer . Parents exterminated since camp , May 17th , 1951 . We wipe them out , yet they keep coming back like mice . Mice don 't assassinate Nazi officers . - I only meant ... - It may reassure you the like in terrorist to insects , they inflict great damage on us today . Never underestimate them . Yes , Obergruppenfuhrer . I vary my route everyday . Yet this Semite know exactly where to find me . How could he , sir ? I don 't know . But I intend to find out . Frank , you in there ? Jesus . Fuck . What are you doing ? Frank . You can broke the chains , how do you think you gonna get out of here ? Was it worth it ? All so you can pass on that stupid film of yours ? That film can change the world . Yeah , it certainly changed mine . Why do you think they tortured us . I gotta a feeling you 're gonna tell me . Because they know that that film shows the world not as it is , but as it could be . Yeah , well , in this world , they flattened DC with an A bomb . How you people think a film 's gonna fight against that ? - You people ? - Yeah , yeah , you people . Dead-enders in the resistance , how many are you , anyway ? What ? Like 7 ? 10 ? 12 ? You really think you 're gonna defeat the Japanese , the Nazis ? Of course . That 's not the way it looks from here . Evil triumph only when good men do nothing . Hello . Can I help you find something ? Yeah . What do you got for kids ? Kids ? Yes , I 'm looking for a boy ... How old is this boy . He 's ten . Here you are . What 's this ? The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Never heard of it . You 'll like it . How much ? 3 marks . Say , the gal who just came in here . What did she buy ? What gal ? Pretty one , you know , she was just in here a few minutes ago . I 'm sorry , I don 't remember any gal . Thank you . When they shall be afraid of that which is high , and fears shall be in the way , and the almond tree shall flourish , and the grasshopper shall be a burden ... Come on , Frank . Frank , Frank , it 's me . Is that Miss Crain ? Mr Baynes , good to see you again . Tagomi . - Please . - Thanks . I see you brought me something . Texture samples . Finest Swedish craftmanship . Our distributors will be delighted . I trust your visit has been uneventful , Colonel Wegner ? Until we received your call this afternoon . Is everything all right with the crown prince ? Yes . Then why have I been called ? Your meeting must be cancelled . Cancelled ? Ambassador Reiss came to see me today . Along with and SS officer , Diels . I know who he is . He reports directly to in Berlin . They 're determined to find a woman smuggling a film destined for the Man in the High Castle . And what does this have to do with us ? We did not inform them about the smuggling . And yet , they know . It 's clear , your nazi colleagues have infiltrated our security services . It 's hardly a surprise . To this degree , the risk is too great . Is that what your sticks tell you ? Do you know how long I worked to organize this meeting ? The risk I 've taken to come here ? - I understand . - I don 't think you do . The Fuhrer is ill . And he could die , and when he does , there 'll be a war between our empires , Mr Tagomi . There will be another time . I cannot travel twice in a forged Swedish passport . I 'll be shot . Give me the secrets , let me deliver them . And if that oracle of yours tell you not to go through with it ? You said yourself , Mr Tagomi . Destiny 's on the hands of men . I 'm afraid , this time that means me . Mrs Crothers , isn 't it ? Yes . I 'm chief inspector Kido , thank you for coming . Well , we weren 't given a choice , actually . We appreciate your cooperation . This must be John . And Emily . We need a picture , please . What 's this about , inspector . Oh , it 's a formality , we 're reviewing the records of your brother . Frank ? Is he okay ? He 's fine . Please , we have a very comfortable waiting room down the hall . I 'll be with you as soon as possible . How long will we be here ? Not long . I hope . Please , follow me . Mom , may we watch TV ? Yes , yes , of course . Please , make yourselves comfortable . Thank you . It 's a beautiful family . What are you gonna do ? You 've heard of Cyclone D ? It 's gas , it 's gas . It 's much improved since the war . Odorless and fast acting . They 'll fall asleep and never wake up . Just ... just let them go . Where is Juliana Crain ? We know Miss Walker met her at an herb shop . We know she gave her the film . We even know she took it to the Neutral Zone . We believe she was at the bus terminal . So all you need to tell us , is which bus she boarded . Where is Juliana Crain ? Is it worth dying for her ? A woman who think you a failure . Who doesn 't even love you . - He 's lying , Frank , stays strong . - やめて 。 That man , is a social deviant . But you , Mr Frink . You are a loyal subject of the empire . You can live a long and prosperous life . Think it over . But don 't think too long . - Coffee ? - Yep , and the turkey pot pie . You got it . Oh , I bought the Bible , by the way . Did you ? I 'd like to discuss it with you . Okay . Not here . So you got the job I see . Yes , sir . I did . - Coffee ? - Thank you . Is that man who just left here from there ? Why ? Just jealous , I guess . You don 't strike me as the jealous type . Well , you don 't know me that well . Very well . Sir , Joe Blake 's on line 1 . Have you been contacted ? Not exactly . Then what is it ? There 's a man here , I think he may be who I 'm looking for . Describe him . Late fiftys , slim built , grey thining hair . Maybe 6 ' 2 " . Anything else ? He makes these little paper birds . I 'll enquire . I have your money . Okay , thank you . I wonder if I can ask you a favor . There 's a man I need to go see . Look , if for some reason I don 't make it back , you think I could ask you to get this to San Francisco for me ? I know , it 's a lot to ask . - Okay , I 'll do it . - Thank you . But ... Mama . How long are we going to be here ? We 'll be going home soon . Hello ? Hello ? Someone there ? Can you open the door , please ? Hello ? Hello ? Tough choice , Frank . Either way , somebody you love dies . Or maybe you all do . They 're scared . Scared this film could bring this whole thing tumbling down . It doesn 't matter what you believe . Does it ? Any more than it matters whether you think you 're a Jew . I wouldn 't blame you if you give in . I mean , most people would . If it is to save innocent lives . But torture , lies , blackmail , that 's how they stay in power . Whatever I do , the Japs stay in power . You 're wrong . You 're wrong . This ends , only when people like us refuse to obey no matter the cost . That 's the only way we defeat these bastards . The only way , you keep your soul , Frank . Keep your soul , Frank . Don 't let them take your soul . Hey , stop . Stop . Randall . Randall . Randall . Mom , if you 're reading this , I didn 't make it back from the Neutral Zone . I travelled here yesterday on a bus ticket that was originally meant for Trudy . Trudy ? Juliana . Trudy gave me a film . It shows a different world . A better world . The hour is late , Mr Frink . I need you to tell me now . Now or never . Where is she ? Just kill me , okay , not them . No , just not them , please . No . Wait . Not , not them . Please , not them . Not them . Please , not them . Hello ? So , we looked into this contact of yours , Joe . Man who makes the origami . Seems he 's a rather dangerous fellow . Dangerous ? Undercover agent for the SD . Not one of ours . He 's probably eliminated quite a few subversives . I see . Your mission 's off the books , Joe . Suggest you steer clear of him . I 'll do that , sir . Good . - Heil Hitler . - Heil Hitler . No , not them . Not them . spot for a chat ? Wanted to make sure we 're alone . She was picked up a few hours age on Okland . We found this in her things . Trudy Walker 's satchel . And the film ? Three counterfeit news reels . We 've been chasing a dead end . No , no . No , no . The film . Excellent work , Trudy . It 's me . Okay ? It 's okay . It 's okay . Here . It 's okay . It 's okay . Come on . - Come on . - No . No . I got you . It 's okay . Hey , Frank . They said you can go home . The suspect has been arrested . What ? The suspect was arrested . A woman who 's a known smuggler carrying Trudy Walker 's satchel . Juliana doesn 't have the film . So it would appear . And my sister and her kids ? No , no . My sister and her kids ? We found out too late , Mr. Frink . But you 're free to go . - No , no , no . - Frank . I 'm free to go ? I am free to go ? You have suffered enough , and I am not a monster . You ever need anymore Jews to kill , you know where to find me . Yes . I do . ほら さっさとしろ

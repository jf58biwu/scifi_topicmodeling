 NOAH : Previously on Heroes Reborn ... LOGUE : Micah has the power to manipulate anything digital . My mother has him , doesn 't she ? I know this place . Carlos ... What are you doing to me ? Get in there and use your weapon . Farah Nazan ? That 's interesting . MALINA : It 's not working . ( PANTING ) Get to the back ! Get to the back ! ( GROANS ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) I don 't think we 've met . I 'm Erica . I have to find him . Because together , we 're gonna save the world . ( GUN FIRING ) ( EMILY SHRIEKS ) Don 't tell me you didn 't feel better when you killed them . LUKE : I didn 't . Liar ! Malina ? ( WIND GUSTING ) I know all this has been really tough on you . It 's been a long night . But you 're safe now . We 're together . I promise you we 're gonna find your brother . Are the people who took Tommy the same people who were chasing me ? Yes . Where 'd they take him ? A place called Midian . And that 's where we 're gonna find him . LUKE : Malina ! You forgot your stuff . Luke Collins . I 'm sorry , how do you two know each other ? He 's the one who drove me here . From Lake Ontario . She saved my life and I think I still owe her for that . What ? What is it ? His wife was the one who killed Caspar . I heard them talking before she started shooting . My , uh , my ex-wife . Sort of . It 's , uh , complicated . Look , I 'm an Evo and I just wanna help . Well , I really appreciate your helping my granddaughter get here , but ... You 're her grandfather ? NOAH : Yeah . And I can take care of her from here . That boy that she 's trying to find , I really wanna help you find him . Why ? Because , I 've ... I 've met him before . Where did you meet him ? It doesn 't matter anymore . Look , Malina ... She changed everything . She showed me my destiny . I genuinely want to help . I think we 're okay on our own . Please . Leave us alone . ( GASPING ) ( DEVICE WHIRRING ) ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Good morning . How are you feeling ? What happened ? Where am I ? You 're at my house . You passed out last night . Passed out ? What happened to the back of my neck ? We weren 't sure what was wrong with you , so I had my staff run some tests . Everything 's normal . You must 've just been exhausted . I had your clothes set out for you . ( SIGHS ) That girl who was at the hospital with the shadow powers , she 's out there , isn 't she ? So , I can 't use mine when she 's around . As a precaution . ( SCOFFS ) Till we trust each other . Oh , I 'm never going to trust you . Where 's my family ? Do you mean Anne , the woman you call your mother , but isn 't ? Hmm ... She left out that little detail , didn 't she ? She didn 't tell you that you had a sister . Or that you were supposed to save the world until last week ? I said , where 's my family ? They 're fine . Safe . As is your grandfather . Did you know we used to work together ? Did he tell you about being brought to Primateoh when you were seven years old ? I never forgot that . To the same place where he and Caspar worked , bagging and tagging Evos . For someone who prides himself on the hard truth , he kept you in the dark . But I will explain everything . Why don 't you get dressed ? We 'll talk downstairs . I believe in science . I believe in facts and data . What about the prophecy and this doomsday event that you don 't want me to stop ? What you 're talking about is the reversal of the poles . How do you stop a celestial event ? ( SIGHS ) ERICA : Tommy , I have a solution . A way to start again after the HELE . Hiro Nakamura created a time bridge between the present and the future . My company has been building a colony there , paving the way for mankind to reboot after the apocalypse . And unfortunately , your grandfather severed that temporal connection when he took Hiro from my facility . No , he rescued him because you were holding him against his will . I have scientists and engineers there , right now . In the future . But they are cut off . Cut off from the present , from their families . If the bridge doesn 't reopen , no one will escape the HELE . That 's why I need you . None of this is the prophecy . All right ? We 're supposed to stop the apocalypse . Tommy , there is no stopping it . If you don 't reopen the bridge , our species goes extinct . Then show me . If what you say is true , then I want to see it . Tell me when and where . We 're going . Hey , how did you get here ? Did Erica send you ? ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) What year are you from ? ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) Where 's my father ? Where is Ren ? Okay , we 're gonna have to take you in . We just wanna make sure that you 're safe . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING CONTINUES ) ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) No security . DAH LIA : The only thing I could find is sewage pipes . Attacking from underneath ... Yeah , could work . There has to be another way . Maybe you should 've stolen the blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours , since she runs the place . Your mother 's using Micah and his powers to ... To control every single bit of information out there . We don 't have much time . So , unless you have a better way to break in , that is the plan . I do . I do . And I think that sociopath mother of mine is gonna help us . FEMALE OFFICER : He 's heading outside . Let 's go . Eyes forward . I will have the rest of the Evos processed , ready and willing , and sent to Gateway by tomorrow . We appreciate that . But we still need to find the girl . Any luck getting her protector to talk ? Well , it 's funny you should say that , 'cause I 'm still working on her . Work fast . We 're on our way . Don 't worry . ( DOOR OPENING ) How are you today , Farah ? Doctor says your gunshot wound is healing nicely . ( EXHALES ) I 'm running out of time and patience . Where 's the girl ? ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) Mind unlocking the handcuffs , too ? FARAH : So I can choke you out . See , now that thought was easy to read . Hmm ... You 're tough ! ( CHUCKLES ) You know that ? Here 's the deal , Farah . All I need from you is to know where that girl wandered off to . That 's it . Who 's watching her now , huh ? Noah Bennet ? What about Angela Petrelli ? FARAH : You 'll never break me . ( GRUNTS ) ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) So , you saw combat . Helped the old U.S. of A. overseas . But did you know there 's somebody else here who fought with you side-by-side ? Carlos Gutierrez . That ring a bell ? ( CHUCKLES ) What do you say I bring him in here ? Help you open up a little bit . You know , I 've found ... When one secret is revealed , the deeper ones , they come so much easier . I gotta say , I think today is gonna be our breakthrough day . What was she like ? My mother . Tough . But thoughtful . She always rooted for the underdog . Stubborn . Not sure if she learned that from me or she just was . You remind me of her . Is that okay ? Yeah . I just want you to know , leaving you and your brother behind was the hardest decision lever had to make . It 's okay . Angela told me why you did what you did . For our safety . What does Erica Kravid want with Tommy ? Why did she kidnap him ? This thing that 's coming ... The HELE ... Erica 's plan is to use Tommy 's power to jump a limited number of people over it into the distant future . Restart the world . But why wouldn 't she wanna save everyone ? I think she likes humanity more than human beings . ( EXHALES ) QUENTIN : Dude . You have , like , the coolest power ever . This is the future ? It 's all gone . Nobody 's here yet because you haven 't decided to save them . No matter what , this was inevitable . Proof that you and your sister failed to stop the HELE . But this ... This is the first city of the future . What ... I call it Gateway . This is how you can save mankind , Tommy . The choice is yours . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( KEYBOARD CLACKING ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( SHUDDERING ) Did anyone see that shogun ? ( SPOON CLATTERING ) ( HANDCUFFS CLANKING ) ( PANTING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) ( SNIFFLES ) Farah ? ( EXPLOSION ) ( MACHINE GUN FIRING ) Gutierrez ! I need you to move your position now ! ( GUN FIRING ) ( EXPLOSION ) ( FIRING CONTINUES ) ( SPEAKING IN URDU ) Gutierrez ! Gutierrez ! Gutierrez , they 're lighting us up ! ( PANTING ) ( FIRING CONTINUES ) MALE SOLDIER : Calling for backup ! ( PANTING ) Okay , so , you froze up , you had to expose yourself , use your powers , save his ass . He comes home a war hero , you go into hiding . And Angela Petrelli called on you to have you take Malina ... Take her where ? Come on . Where ? Take her where ? Come on , Farah , where ? Where is she ? CARLOS : We can be together . You haven 't told her that yet , have you ? ( CHUCKLES ) Did you know that he wanted to run away with you ? Yeah , hasn 't gotten over you since you parted ways . Can 't protect your brother , can 't protect the woman that you love , can 't protect your nephew , but he dresses up like a superhero ? Where 's Jose , you son of a ... MATT : That 's enough . ( CHUCKLES ) Ah , you 're as useless as you were in Afghanistan . And you . What were you thinking back then ? Come on . There is something deep that you are not telling me , Farah . What is it ? Once it comes out , everything else follows . That 's the way this ... Gutierrez ! Get in there and use your weapon . ... works . Oh ! ( CHUCKLES ) Oh . You 're in love with him . All right , well , let 's see if this shakes things loose . Huh ? ( GUN COCKS ) Now tell me where Malina is . ( PANTING ) TAYLOR : She has a limp , but don 't overdo it . Slow and steady . Remember , if you don 't pull this off , we 're gonna join your friend Micah in there . Speak with authority . Like you own this place . Controlling , condescending and humorless . God , she sounds awful . Miss Kravid , we weren 't expecting you . It 's exactly why we 're here . Please don 't look at my daughter that way . Taylor . Now comes the hard part . MATT : Now , Farah , where 's Malina going ? Now you just tell me and you can let him go . ( PANTING ) Come on , Farah . This is the only way you 're going to get out of this . Trust me . ( PANTING CONTINUES ) Tell me where Malina is , Farah . Or I will kill him . Tell me where Malina is or I will kill him ! This is easy for me ! No ! Please stop ! I don 't want him to die . I 'll tell you . ( BEEPING ) Okay , let 's hear it . I 'm sorry , Director , but Erica Kravid is here to see you . Erica ? ( SIGHS ) Um , all right , prepare the rest of the Evos immediately and tell Miss Kravid that I will be with her in a moment . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Now , Farah , you 're gonna tell me everything about Malina and where she 's heading . ( BELL DINGS ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) I knew he 'd follow us . Wait in the car for a minute . Nice car . LUKE : Listen ... I just want to help . Yeah . We heard you the first time , we 're not interested . Oh , yeah , and where were you when she was crossing the country by herself ? She 's safe now , that 's all that matters . Listen , Malina is meant to do something important . We both know this . And you what ? You just want to come along for the ride ? Why don 't you tell me how you knew where the boy was ? ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) My wife and I , we were hunting Evos because we thought they 'd killed our son on June 13th . It was , uh , I don 't know , some misguided retribution . We were gonna kill him . Evos did not kill your son . Look , I don 't know you , okay , but something tells me you understand loss and what that does to a parent . You don 't know anything about me . Okay , fine . Maybe I don 't . What am I supposed to say ? I am sorry . What I did wasn 't right . The things that I 've done , they will haunt me for the rest of my life . ( STAMMERS ) They brought me to try and kill myself until your granddaughter saved me . There 's got to be a reason behind that . Look , you have every reason not to trust me . But I am different now . NOAH : Let 's go , there 's a big storm coming . MAN 1 : ( ON RADIO ) Head back to base - We found the others . MAN 2 : Copy that . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) ( EXHALES ) ( ELEVATOR DINGS ) MAN : Who are you ? ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( HACHIRO SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( IN ENGLISH ) Intruder ! Intruder is here ! Intruder ... ( ALARMS BLARING ) ( DISTANT VOICES ) ( ALARMS BLARING ) How is this place gonna fit seven billion people ? It 's not . This is the first of many . All of which you 're gonna fill . QUENTIN : It 's pretty crazy that I had to kidnap Noah Bennet 's grandson in order to save the world . Please don 't tell me you feel guilty . If it had been me , I would have shot your old buddy . And we 'd be holding Tommy 's family hostage so he 'd do what we want . I 'm having a hard time believing you , right now . Do you see this ? This is my power . To take away light , to take away the powers of others . I remember when you were just making crazy shadow puppets . When you were my kid sister I was dropping off at college . Are you seriously okay with everything that 's going on here ? There 's no going back , Quentin . This is who I am . At least Erica 's found a use for it . Sometimes I think she understands me better than you do . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( GASPS ) REN : Shogun ! ( SPEAKS IN JAPANESE ) ( SIGHS ) Sorry to keep you waiting . Had I known you were here , I would have met you at the door . ERICA : Sometimes that 's the best time to come . When no one 's expecting you . Uh , yeah . I would 've had all these assets prepared for you , had I known the time bridge was back in operation . I 'm assuming that 's what you ... That 's what you want . I 'm sorry , we haven 't met yet . You are ... Oh , my daughter . Taylor . TAYLOR : I need to find Francis . I wonder if he knows where Francis is . Francis ? Francis Culp . Why are you interested in Francis Culp ? You read my mind ? MATT : Yeah , that 's sort of my thing . I need to talk to Micah Sanders . Micah ? ERICA : Oh , crap . What are you really doing here ... Erica ? ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ) ( GROANS ) ( PANTING ) That was close . See what else you can find . Then try to get your Truther friends in . I 'll find Micah . ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING IN JAPANESE ) ( GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) Oh , my God , this is ... Amazing . All of it . I don 't know what to say . I had a lot of help . Why is there a scar on the back of my neck ? I put you in the machine to try to steal your powers . But it didn 't Work . Why ? Because you 're different . Time travel is an incredible power , Tommy . The fate of the world was in the balance and I made a call . And here we are . Okay , I 'll help , but don 't lie to me . Thank you . What I saw out there , the wasteland , I don 't want that to happen to my family , my friends . I want them here . I want as many people as I can take here . Of course , we will make that possible . But first , we need more supplies and resources . Everything possible to help make sure that we have the best chance at survival . Thank you . A group of scientists were attacked under the arch by a Japanese girl . She 's a tenacious little construct . Hunt it down and kill it . And bring me Otomo . ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR LOCK CLICKS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( GROANS ) How did you ... How did you know that wasn 't me ? Oh , I didn 't . What ? Well , ask a question ! Find out first ! You could 've killed me . 50-50 is pretty good odds . Yeah , if you 're shooting somebody who doesn 't matter . HARRIS : You got that right . So did she talk ? Uh , yes . Yes , she talked . Malina knows about Odessa , she 's on her way . Do you have a lead on where she is now ? That girl cannot connect with her brother . We are closing in . Yes . Taylor Kravid is here and this guy tried to pass himself off as Erica . That is who you should be focusing on and anyone else who 's trying to infiltrate us . We 're already taking care of it . ( DOOR OPENING ) Move it . The Director doesn 't like the Evos to hear gunfire . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( BUZZING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) Come on , Farah . ( PANTING ) Get up ! The hell with it . The slap did the trick . ( CHUCKLES ) You came back . You once told me to be brave . ( GUN CLICKS ) How about I start today ? Let 's go . This is bad . We have to do something . We 're dead center in the path of this thing . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) Stay here , I 'm gonna ... Malina ! WOMAN : Careful ! ( WIND HOWLING ) NOAH : Malina ! Sir , stay in your car , please . It 's safer in your car . I wouldn 't go in there if I were you . WOMAN : Get back in your car ! It 's not safe ! ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Oh , my God . ( MUTTERING ) ( GASPS ) Whoa ! Hands where I can see them . I 'm not one of them . I mean , I don 't work here and it doesn 't look like you do , either . Behind you ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( GRUNTS ) And who exactly are you ? I 'm with Hero Truther . FARAH : Don 't move . Hero Truther . Jose told me something about them . But how can we be sure you 're not lying ? I 'm here looking for our leader , Micah Sanders . Now please , stop pointing your guns at me . We can 't trust her . Why would I warn you about the guards ? Something tells me we 're here for the same thing and we are running out of time . Yeah , we are . How you doing today , Micah ? Erica Kravid is up to something . She 's got a list of everyone going to the future . I need you to find it for me . I have to know that I 'm on that list , Micah . I 'm not getting left behind . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) That 's it . That 's it . Yes , that 's it . That 's it . ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) ( SIGHS ) Odessa . ERICA : Good . Tommy , there are two others I 'd like you to send back . You 're not afraid I 'll leave you here ? No , I think we trust each other now . I should stay . No , go back and contact Harris and then find his sister . Go . When can we bring the others here ? Soon . Okay . ( GROANS ) ( YELLING ) Guards , get him out of there , go ! Who are you ? We don 't have much time . ( PANTING ) Master of time and space , it is my mission to free you . No ! ( WIND HOWLING ) ( MUTTERING ) Come on ! ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMING ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( WHIMPERING ) MAN : Look at that ! She caused this ! You all right ? You 're an Evo . You caused this . You people need to be stopped before this gets worse . ALL : Whoa ! I think maybe everybody just needs to take a step back . MAN 1 : Who 's that ? MAN 2 : Watch yourself . Malina . Come on . Come on , honey . My grandfather . Where is he ? ( SIGHS ) He was ... He was somewhere near that car , I think . Oh , my God . No . He has to be here somewhere . We have to go . I 'm not leaving without him . ( GUNSHOT ) Malina , we have to go now ! FARAH : Don 't ! The gates . Open them . Move . Where is everyone ? The last transport for Odessa just left . ( ELECTRONIC BEEPING ) He should be out there . Come on . ( PANTING ) RENE : Run !

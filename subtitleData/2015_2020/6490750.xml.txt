 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha - Ladies and gentlemen , we have just reached our cruising altitude . This is William Strong , your pilot for this ride across the pond , My co-pilot is Daniel Prentice We 're looking at a total flight time of just around seven and a half hours which should put us on the ground in London , England right on time . Forecast calls for clear skies so sit back relax , enjoy your ride . You didn 't get that haircut we talked about after your vacation . - It 's still within regulations . - Barely . - Sir , are you doing Ok ? Here you go , sweetie - Thank you . - Can I get you anything ? Another late night , party girl ? - Oh , shush . We 'll all cross checks at dawn . Been in the air a while . How you doing ? - I have still a few more hours to get through . Hey wing-man , you 're making me nervous . Something up over there ? - I don 't know . - Maybe a short somewhere ? - Ha . See ? All you need is just a little ... - Come on , Daniel , disengage the yoke . I got it figured out . Gander center , this is I-A 42 We seem to be having some bit of an instrument problem , we 're trying to sort them out . I-A 42 . - Understood , I-A 42 . - You 're looking at clear skies ahead of you in all directions . Let us know if you need assistance . - Will do , I-A 42 . Daniel , I can 't fly like this , man . Damn it . Gander center . This is IA-42 . I thought you said we had clear skies . - You had clear skies five seconds ago , IA-42 . It pumped um on our screens out of nowhere . Squack 7700 Do you have any way around this ? We 're showing it right on top of you . - Ladies and gentlemen please return to your seats . We seem to be ... Crew ! Secure the cabin and return to your seats immediately . - Shit ! - Think we can fly around it ? - I think we have to go straight through . - The hatch is rolling . - Oh god . - What happened ? - Are you alright ? - It 's night already ? Sunset wasn 't for another forty or fifty minutes . We didn 't black out or anything , did we ? - Oh , nothing like that . - Sorry about that , everyone . We had a sudden storm pop up there . Good news we have past the worst of it . It should be smooth sailing from hereon in . You 'll notice that while we were going through that storm , the sun went down That 'll happen sometimes when you cross the tip of the Bermuda triangle . Don 't worry . You 'll catch another sunset tomorrow . - The tip of the Bermuda triangle ? - It 's as good Sn answer as any . - Anyone else 's internet connection down ? - Yeah , my phone signal 's dead , too . - Jesus , you seeing this ? Above altitude , airspeed fuel - But that 's just enough to keep us airborne . three-quarters of attack level , fine , but that 's assuming we 're still on course . - You 've got control . Disengaging . Gander center , this is IA-42 , we 've gone through the storm . But it seems most of our instruments are out . Require assistance . IA-42 . Gander center this is London bound IA-42 . Do you read me ? I don 't know what 's going on . - Check the backup system . There must be something that 's working . - On it . Gander center , this is IA-42 , do you copy ? Still nothing . You ? - We 've got one thing humming along just fine . - That ... what is it ? - Our radar system . Only thing on the plane that wasn 't replaced last time we upgraded international airline avionics . As long as that 's operational . That 's a step in the right direction . - How you doing here ? - Oh , good , thank you . - Thank you . - Can I get you something to drink ? - Sorry , were you standing there long ? - No , that 's fine . What can I get you ? - A ginger ale . It got dark early , didn 't it ? - I 'm sure it 's just because of the storm , like the captain said . - Thank you . - So , what brings you gentlemen to England , business or pleasure ? - Both . - We 're history professors . ECU university . There 's convention just outside London . - They 've discovered some amazing pre war artifacts , and several distinguished members of the ... - You didn 't have to bore the poor woman . her eyes are glazing over already . - No , that 's fine . I just need to finish this side of the plane , but I 'd love to hear about it so I 'll come back . - I 'm gonna hold you to that . - Get out now while you still can . Alright , about the Hitler map of Argentina ... - What are you working on there ? - Who ? me ? just trying to keep track of everything . You see , when you get to my age , you have to stay on top of things , because uh ... you never know when you are going to get another chance . - Well , I 'll let you get back to it , then . - Thank you , then . - Huh , that 's weird . - You got some more good news for me ? - Take a look . - There 's nothing there . - Not a blip . - Is the radar malfunctioned too ? - I thought so at first , but the coordinates are moving with us . If this thing were in the fritz , it wouldn 't be working at all . - So we 're flying deaf but not completely blind ? - There should be some air traffic showing up around us . - Ok , so let 's make a loop . Try to find someone or something . - Nothing . Butkus According to the radar , we 're all alone up here . - Maybe the storm diverted traffic . We 'll wait until the radios come back up . - What if it doesn 't ? We 're still a couple of hours away from London . That 's assuming we didn 't get turned around . Or blown off course . If we duck under the cloud cover , we may be able to find some visual cue from a shipping lane or maybe a message being relayed from a cargo ship . - You sure that 's the right move ? - If no one can hear us on the ground , that 's the only move you 've got . - This is Cameron . - Hey , Hicks . How 's it going back there ? - We 're all a little rattled but we 're fine . - Good . I want to make an announcement and I want the crew back in their seats when we 're making a descent . - Is everything Ok ? - Just trying to get away from some of this ... uh ... high-level wind shield . Just get everyone strapped in , Ok ? - Sure . - Everything Ok ? - We need to get everyone to their seats . We 're making a descent . He says it 's to get away from the turbulence . - What turbulence ? - Ladies and gentlemen , we 'd like everyone to get back in their seats , We 're trying to get away from this turbulence so we 'll be ducking under the clouds for a bit . Pretty routine stuff . But we 'd like everyone buckled in just in case . - All secure back here , captain . - You Ok ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Trust me . When you 've been doing this as long as I have , you 've seen it all . This is nothing . - Alright . Ok . - Land ? The Atlantic should be below us . - So it should be . - Ok . So we got blown off course . Gander center , do you copy ? - Keep your eyes open for a radio tower . Blinking lights , anything . Radar says we got small aircraft about twenty kilometers away . But they 're all bunched up . - Are you sure that 's aircraft ? Never seen anything like that before . - I 'm not sure of anything , but we 're closing in on whatever the hell this is . - It 's too hazy up ahead . Could be another storm . - That 's not a storm . Looks more like a ... fire ! - Oh , my God ! - Have you seen that ? - Oh my God ! Jesus ... Christ . - What 's happening ? - Oh my God ! - What is happening ? - Well ? - We 've got something close coming in hot 09 Cut the NAV lights Shit ! You 're sitting duck out here . Hang on ! Watch that radar ! - Hey , What ... what 's going on ? - What 's happening is we 're going to get shot down just like those other planes in the Ukraine . - We deserve to know what 's happening . - As soon as the captain has everything under control . I 'm sure that He 'll inform us as to exactly ... - Hey , I just want ... I 'm trying to get some answers , Ok ? - As soon as we know what 's going on , sir , we 'll let you know . - What ? No ! No ! We want answers . - Sir , let ... go of me . - Sir . If you don 't sit down , we will have to restrain you . Now , sit down ! - Fine . - Strong . - Will , what 's going on ? - We 're trying to get a handle of this . Is everyone Ok back there ? - Everyone 's fine ... just confused and concerned . - Let me address the plane . We 'll let you know as soon as we can . Just keep everybody calm , Ok ? - Looks like we 're clear . Nothing anywhere close . - I 'm gonna keep putting some distance between us and them . In a few minutes we 'll try to duck below again , Ok ? - What ? Will , that didn 't work out so great last time ! - We also don 't know where we are . Without instruments , all we got are the landmarks and we can 't find them from above the clouds . Ladies and gentlemen Our party is without scare . We 've got blown off course it might have been because of that storm , but appear to be out of danger . We ask all of you to please bear with us and stay calm , the flight crew 's here to help . - Excuse me . Sorry . - No , no problem . How can I help you ? - We were actually hoping we could help you . - Sorry , gentlemen . I don 't have time right now , it 'll have to wait . - Captain , it 's Cameron . - This isn 't the best time to talk . - Captain , my name is Bennett and this is my colleague Dale . - You can 't be in the cockpit . Hicks , get them out of here . Roger room , We need some help ! Do you know what kind of aircraft that was back there ? - I want you guys back in your seats . - They were Junkers , JU-88s A couple of Hinklers H111 , sir ! - I made it very clear . - No one 's made crop planes like that since 1945 ! - You have to listen to us ! There 's no way those planes can still be flying . - You seem to be flying without your instruments , captain . - Are you doing all this ? - No , no of course not . We can see they 're down . - We are flying without most of them . - Everything that talk through is satellite . The radar is the only thing that 's working . Complete signal loss . Almost as if there are no satellites . - You have thirty seconds . - Is your radio working ? - I 'm getting some static but ... - You haven 't been able to contact anyone since you passed through . - Something like that . - That 's because there weren 't many allied radio towers on the western front in 1940 . - Hey ... Take it easy . Try to sleep . - I can 't sleep now . - Me neither . That 's odd . - Based on the coastline , the planes , we believe we just flew through the bombing of St. Azair . - June 1940 massive German bombing on the west coast of France . - I don 't have time for this . Get this conspiracy theorist back on his seat . - Wait . We can help you figure out where we are . If you dip back where all the clouds get , we do know a little bit about the geography of World War II - Ok ... Ok ... you guys can help out . But get back to your seats now . - Of course , Captain . - And at a lower altitude . You 'll be better off picking up weaker frequencies ... - I don 't want to hear anything about time travel , Ok ? Let 's just figure out where we are first . - Even though it looks outdated , that radar is more advanced than anything the Germans are using at this point . - Enough ... Now get back to your seats . - The point is , that radar will keep you one step ahead if we come across another one of those again . - Even if you were right , which is a massive , massive if , How do you propose we get back , huh ? - We look for another weather anomaly . If one of these things brought us here , another one should be able to bring us back . - So we look for another storm ? - Yeah . - Can you get our new friends back to their seats , please ? - Yeah , right now . Gentlemen . - And hey ... All of you ... not a word . To anyone . Ok ? - Ok . - Gentlemen . - We 're having electrical issues . - What about the planes ? And the bombs ? - I just don 't want anyone to panic , Ok ? - Can you handle it ? - Captain ? - We 'll get through this . I 've flown with you a million times , you 've never let me down once ! - We will be making another controlled descent but there is nothing to worry about . Thank you for your cooperation and patience . - I don 't see how you can make that plan work . - It makes sense , look , it 's logical ... And when exactly do you think physics agrees to that ? Shut up . I 'm telling you it 's gonna work . - You can 't know that . - ( sighs ) Ok . - Can I help you sir ? - What 'd the captain say ? - You heard him . We 're moving to a lower altitude , to access the situation . - Ok ... But what 's going on ? - I assure you , sir ... you 'll know when everyone else does . Now please let go of my arm . Thank you . I promise you ... if you touch me again , You 're going to have an entirely different set of problems for you to deal with . - Ok , if we can pick out any landmarks at all ... - It 's gonna be tricky . Without the twenty-first century pollution , there 's ... you 're ... you 're certain that that was Saint Azaire ? - It was the only coastline bombing of that scope in 1940 . - Alight . Alright . Get me some pencils . A scheduler . - Ok . - Let 's keep an eye out for storms . - Don 't you start . - Time travel storm chasing , this is insane . - I know . None of this makes any sense . It will start to make sense once we know where we are , so let 's focus on that for now , Ok ? Mayday . This is IA flight 42 out of Dallas . Open transition to anyone . We were end route to Heathrow and got blown off course . Looking for assistance . Repeat This is IA flight 42 Mayday . Is anyone out there ? Over . - We 're clear for miles according to the radar . Let 's try to figure out where the hell we are . - Hey , over there . Is that a river ? - Eh ... maybe ? Sketch it anyway . This is unbelievable , I mean ... right now , below us , the invasion is in full swing . - If this really is June Hitler is about halfway through the tour of his forces . Another week from now , it 'll be Paris . - Shouldn 't there be lights ? Cities ? - Probably just a power outage . It 'll explain why we can 't hear anyone . Repeat . This is flight 42 . If anyone can hear me , please acknowledge . - indistinctly speaking French French , I think . Maybe those guys are right . Maybe we are in France . Wait , wait wait wait wait , wait . is that German ? - Repeat Over . - Hello ! This is captain William Strong . IA flight 42 . Do you copy ? - Fly over international airspace , please identify yourself . - This is captain William Strong requesting assistance . Do you copy ? - Captain ? Listen , Whoever this is , this is a localized channel . to be used in emergencies only . Over . - This is flight 42 out of Dallas . We 've been flying blind . We think we just saw some ... German bombers . - Bombers ? Are you claiming to be aboard an aircraft ? - Yes ! Hello ? - My name is Corporal Nigel Shetfield . My position is classified , but it my duty to intercept long range transmissions . And it is simply not possible for you to be aboard an aircraft . - Look , I don 't have time to mess around . Can you just get us in touch with civilian air traffic control ? We need to land ASAP . - Air traffic control ? This is a war zone . Anyone who can help us . Anyone . Alright , captain . What branch of the military are you in ? - We are ... a commercial airline . International . - And you 've flown through German bombing run ? No , it 's absurd . - Look ... Can you just help us get our bearing ? What is your GMT ? - Fine , captain . 17th June , 2130 hours . - And the year ? - Uh , are you joking ? - Let 's all get on the same page , Nigel , Ok ? - 17th June 1940 Do they not stock calendars in international airlines ? If this charade is quite finished , I 'd highly recommend you get off this channel and ... - Listen ! I don 't know if you 're part of some sick hoax , but we are in distress You 're the only person we 've been able to reach . - Hoax ? We 're certainly not . Now , kindly remove yourself from this frequency and ... - How do I convince you that we 're a commercial airline in distress ? - Sure I don 't know captain . - Ok ... Here ? - Here ? - It has to be . So if ... If that 's red , then ... then ... that means that - Oh , we 've got to tell the captain . Come on . - Look ... even if this is a hoax , Nigel , or whoever you are , all we 've got is our fuel gauge , altitude , and radar that 's working at the moment . - Your radar ? - You know ? Radar detection ? Scans the skies , lets you know where other air crafts and objects are ? - Well that certainly sounds familiar to the IDF technology we Brits are developing , but but I have nothing like that at my disposal . - Well , that 's the only thing that 's keeping us up in the air at the moment . - Captain , we think we know where we are . Nigel , I have just been joined by a couple of history professors . They think they know where we are . - I beg your pardon ? - We were able to pick out a very identifiable river and surrounding hills . - We 've just passed over Rhen in the northwest of France based on the timing since the last bombing , it 's our best guest . Uh , we ... we 're relatively certain that we flew through the bombing of St Nazaire where the RMS Lancastria was attacked and sunk - Sunk ? The Lancastria ? Even if that were true , how can you possibly ... - You 're ... you 're going to find this hard to believe , but we were en route from DC to ... to London in the twenty-first century and we flew through a storm or something and now we 're here . - This is hard ... - Look , forget about that This is what we know . We 're up here all alone , and we 're in a war zone . Nigel can come by without your help . - What ... what if we were able to tell you about the bombing of saint Nazaire ? - What could you tell me ? - The air forces ... Junker ju 88s , Heinkel he 111s Messerschmidt Bf 110s likely prototypes . And the Lancastria . Radio the front . You 'll be able to confirm she was lost . - Yes , well , I 'll do just that . If you 're serious , go back on this frequency in thirty minutes . - Recap in thirty minutes . Call us back in five . - I 'll do what I can . God help me . - Show me the route . The two points you 've figured out . - Think we can come in the course ? - Hopefully Then we can figure out our range . Just under half a tank right now . - Uh , Shetfield . - Coronal , moment . - Any news ? - One transmission , sir . You 're going to want to hear about it . - Ladies and gentlemen . I ... I have information that this flight crew has neglected to give us . - Sir , I 'm going to need you ... - Get your hands of me . And I know how this is gonna sound . But I believe that somehow we have traveled through time . - How many drinks have you had ? - We all saw that storm . And ... and the planes and the bombs ... She knows . Somehow , we 've time traveled back to the middle of World War II . - Everyone please stay calm . There 's not - - No ! no one is telling us anything . We have a right to know . - Sit down , you 're scaring everyone . - You ... you might not believe that we 've traveled through time , but we 're clearly in a war zone . - So what ? - So ? We 're not gonna survive . This jet wasn 't built for war . But ... listen ... listen ... Do you know what this means ? Right now as we speak , we ... we 're flying over France . In June of 1940 . On the ground , Hitler has joined his forces and we ... all of us , all of us ... we have one opportunity to change human history . We can kill Hitler . - Ok , and ... um ... how do you propose we do that ? They tried to assassinate Hitler during the war and failed . - Ok , during the war , they were operating on outdated intelligence . We ... we know exactly where Hitler will be . It 's all here in this book . Everything step-by-step detailed information exactly where Hitler and the SS went . - Ok , they will see us coming from miles away. it 's suicide . it wouldn 't work . - We 're ... we 're surrounded by bombers . and ... and attack planes . We 're ... we 're probably not gonna survive . But we can land this plane we can find Hitler and we can kill him . - Ok , that 's enough ! - Whoa , whoa ... - Let him go . - Oh God . - He 's right . - We need to take matter into our own hands . We cam prevent the Holocaust . - We would just need to find a safe place to land . And convince the pilots . - Gentlemen ! - Stop , stop , stop ... - Stand down . - I would think that you would be on our side , Sargent . We can win this war . - Or you could be making t he whole thing up . But what I do know is you 're trying to hijack this plane . And that 's an act of terrorism . - I 'm a patriot . - Listen , we can do this the easy way or the hard way . But there is no way me and Private Jackson here are letting you take that cockpit . - You think you can stop us ? - I don 't think you want to find out - We could use you in this plan , Sargent . You could be heroes . - I 'd prefer not to fight over this . - Get off of me ! You ... - What was that ? - Whoa , you 're not thinking this through . - No sir , you 're not thinking this through . Suppose we try it . It 's easy to make a mistake . Even when you think you know exactly where the enemy is . Trust me . Say it really is World War II down there , and we make one slip up , just one , The axis will have this plane , the technology , and that book , which will tell Hitler everything . There will be a Nazi flag flying all over the White House all because you wanted to be a hero . But maybe we can change the past , but we can also screw it up . Forever . Now get back to your seat . Shut the hell up . - Yeah ? - Everyone Ok back there ? - Yes . Nothing we couldn 't handle . - We can always tie them up , then . Taking fights at them . Isn 't it right ? - Yeah , Ah , yes , sir . - We 'll keep him out of your way , ma 'am . - Thank you . - Thanks yourself . That 's why we make fire extinguisher . - At our current speed , we 've got about 150 minutes in the air , tops . That 's not counting climbing or descending , either . - At least we know where we 're headed . We do know where we 're headed , right ? - We should be just about middle of France . - So if we maintain our course , we should be able to find some friendlies or a safe landing place soon , right ? What happened ? - Some idiots on board tried to hijack the plane because they want to kill Hitler . Some soldiers on board tried to peace the situation , but passengers are gonna need answers . And soon . - Corporal Nigel Shetfield calling Captain William Strong . - This is Captain Strong . Go ahead , Nigel . - So you 're still here . - I 'm afraid you 're stuck with us . And that was more like ten minutes , Nigel . - Yes , some things take time , captain . I 've talked things over with command it 's one of the boys in the Western front and while we 're inclined to believe you , talking about the time travel you understand . Your Intel about the Lancaster seems to be accurate . And the truth is ... This helped us out a lot . I mean , no one on the ground was able to ascertain the extent of the fire power , And you guys would certainly not give out that kind of information . - On that , we are on the same page about something , Nigel . - Yes , well ... we could do with any bit of good Intel we can now . After duck ! Sorry about that . it 's just such a bloody runt . - A runt ? No , no ... Allied forces evacuated hundreds of thousands of troops . - Evacuated ? Maybe you all seen a newspaper ? The Germans closed us from both sides. it was a bloody slaughter . Nearly half a million was killed . Cut down . - What is it ? - He said that Dunkirk was a ... was a slaughter . That 's not how it happened . - Dunkirk was a hugely successful allied evacuation mission , they rescued 400 , 000 troops . - So if you 're right ... the past that we 're in ... is not the one that we know . Sorry about that , Nigel . - Well , captain , I suppose the question is How can I help ? - Right now , we need two things . A safe route and a safe place to land . And also any information you have on any unusual storms in the area . - I 'll do what I can , captain . What 's your current position ? - We 're near Vier , near as we can tell . Just passed Rhen not too long ago . Heading in a straight line . - You 're nearing the German border , then . What 's your current air speed ? - 400 knots . - I hate to say this , captain . But the first thing you need to do is change course . We 've intercepted a chat on German frequencies . There 's been talk of a rather large aircraft near France . - So , whoever is performing these bombing runs , knows that we 're here . Are there any friendlies in the area ? Anyone who can get their eyes on us ? - I 've just got to say we don 't know exactly where you are . - What if we were more viable ? - How 'd you mean ? - We 've been flying with our NAV lights off . But we can turn on our landing and running lights . - Are you sure about that ? Most of our systems are out . - They 're analog , right ? Here it goes . - Nigel ? We 've got something coming straight for us . - Uh , one moment , captain . it could just be allies . - Well , we 've got company about thirty seconds out coming fast ! - Well , captain , there are no sightings of any aircraft in our area . - Gentlemen , I need you in your seats , now . And not a word to anyone . Get everyone secured . - Will , I ... - Now . - Captain , just got word that some German activity is headed your way . - All secure back here , captain . - Some goddam Nazi plane . - They 've got jets , too ? They shouldn 't have those yet . - Kill the lights . Talk to me , Daniel . - they 're coming in behind us . - Oh , my God . - They 're still on us ! - I know ! - Captain . Will , are you there ? - Not now , Nigel . Getting shot at ! - IA 42 , do you copy ? Damn it ! - You got a plan ? - Yeah . Kind of . Don 't freak out . - What ? Why ? 3,000 feet . 2,000 feet . Will , 1,000 ! - So long ! Pull ! - Two planes ! Right behind us ! - ( groans in pain ) - Damn ! Just hang on . We need first aid kid in the cockpit , stat ! Dan 's been hit . Hang on buddy ! I got you ! - Oh , no , no , no , no . - Hold on , buddy . Just hold on . - ( groans in pain ) Ok , Ok , Ok ... Alright . Let me take a look at it . it 's not as bad as it looks . You sure about that ? It 's mostly superficial . You 're going to need some stitches , but it 's going to have to wait . You Ok ? Yeah ... It hurts like a son of a bitch but I 'll be fine . How 's the plane ? - Could be a lot worse . Burned some serious fuel during that move . But not actively losing any , We 've lost cabin pressure . I 'll keep us below 15,000 feet . - Is that bad ? - Definitely bad ! - Probably have to cycle it again . - ( groans in pain ) - Nigel ! We 've got a problem , buddy ! Nigel ! - ( groans in pain ) Did the radio get hit ? - No , it just got static . I think we 're out of range . Oh , boy . - So we can stay in cloud cover and stay safe or we could talk to our friend Nigel and get shot at ! And we can 't land without our front wheels . Perfect ! - Captain ? - ( groans in pain ) - Just give me a minute . - Will , if the passengers know what 's going on , maybe some of them can help . We have to work together right now . All of us . - Daniel , can you fly the plane ? - Yeah , I think so , yeah . I 'm going to need some extra hands just in case . - Stay with him . Take my seat . - Are you sure ? - I 'm sure . - Ok ... - Come on . Come on . - Sir , take your seat this instant . - Keep us in the dark ? - Sir ... - We need to know if we 're gonna die out here . - I need you to calm down ... - You haven 't told us one thing . - Sir ... we want you to keep calm and take your seat . Ok ? Ladies and gentlemen , I 'm your captain . William Strong . And it 's time I tell you the truth . - We 're on the move , sir ? - Not you . We need you to stay put . Any news from our friends ? Not much . Last I checked they were in a Don 't fight Jerry 's . I lost contact . I fear that ... ( sigh ) I 'll keep trying , sir . - If you manage to make contact , you 'll have to gather information about their radar . - Yes sir . I 'll do all I can . - If it really is some kind of super plane , better destroyed than captured by the axis . We may have no choice than to blow the damn thing out of the sky ourselves . - I want to apologize for keeping you in the dark for so long . We encountered what we thought was a weather anomaly , but it is something more than that . Some of us , including my co-pilot Daniel , believe that we have traveled back in time . With the assistance of these men as well as my contact on the ground , we 've determined That we 're over France . These men believe it 's currently 1940 . - That 's impossible ! - Regardless , We are in a war zone . And we 're all in danger . If we stay invisible we 'll be safe . The most important thing you can do , all of you , is to remain calm . All we can do is fly and try to find a safe place to land . Do you all agree ? As for the landing , The other planes that were firing at us have damaged our landing gear . It won 't open . And we 're trying to fix it . But I can 't do it alone . Is there anyone here who can help me ? Who 's wiling to go below and help ? - Captain ? I 'm an engineer . We ... we 're working with hydraulics , right ? - That 's right . - I 'll go with you . - Thank you ... - Teresa . - That 'll be great help , Teresa . Anyone else ? - Es El minimo Que puedo hacer . Yo los puedo ayudar . Eh ... I can help . I ... a handyman . As you say . - Thank you , mister ... - Hector . Me llamo Hector . - Happy to have you , Hector . Thank you . Much appreciated . We 're gonna head below . The flight crew is in charge . Daniel will keep us in the air , if there 's any trouble he 'll contact me . We 're done keeping you in the dark . Now we 're focused on keeping everyone safe . Teresa , Hector . Follow me . - You know time travel 's impossible , right ? - Of course I do . - All of things are possible if you have faith . - No puncture . That 's good . - Captain , look at this . - Maybe ... we can splice - You 're on top of things . I like that , Hector . Right , that should ... do it . - Stay back , Stay back ! Daniel ! We 've just opened the doors ! Try the gear now ! - Copy that . That 's a negative , Will . - Look that . Look ! - I see it ! - We have to get that out ! Hey Daniel ! Try and close the landing gear again ! - Did that do it ? - Back it up , Daniel ! Just turn the light off ! Turn off the Nav gear and take out that chapel ! - That 's insane ! - I 'm out of better ideas . Daniel ! We have to slow her down to get out of the wind ! Take her down to 150 knots or so , Ok ? Hold on ! - Done . I fix ! I fix ! - Hector , I can 't let you ! Wait ! It 's two pilots ! It 's you . Please . Try , please . - I think that did it , Will . - Hector ! Hang on ! Hang on , Hector ! - Hector ! - Hector ! - Swing on to the wheels ! Come on , Hector , you 've got this ! - Hector ! Come on , Hector ! Close the landing gear now ! Come on , Hector ! Take my hand ! Come on , Hector ! - Will , is everything alright ? - We 're Ok . Hang tight . We 're coming out . The landing gear is fixed . Thanks to these two heroes over here . How 's it going ? We 've burned most of our fuel in the one with those moves . Got about 90 minutes of flight time give or take . - How 's our go heading ? - Should be almost to the border between France and Switzerland . Good work , Brianna . I 'll take over . - Ok . - We need to contact Nigel . Tell him that we don 't have much time . We have to go below the clouds . - I already got shot once today . - Ladies and gentlemen , we will be making a descent . in order to establish radio contact . Nigel ... Come in . Can you hear me ? - Captain Strong . - Nigel , good to hear your voice ! - My God . You broke off contact so abruptly I I feared the worst . How on earth did you manage to lose those planes ? - We had to deceive them by going above the clouds . At least now we know where our radio transmission ranges . - What 's your current location ? - We 're just above the Swiss border . We have about eighty minutes of flying left , which isn 't a lot of time to figure things out . - Earlier you mentioned something about a ... uh .. .weather anomaly - That 's right ... before we got displaced we went through the center of a storm the likes of which I 've never seen . Black clouds and some kind of a blue energy in the center of it . - Right . I 'll investigate . Now , the most pressing is your proximity to German air space . I suggest you stay on course . I 'm trying to find a potential landing spot for you . And my commanding officer is insisting that I get more information on this ... radar of yours . - What do you want to know , Nigel ? - Well , everything you can tell me . - Captain , may I ? - Sir , this is Bennett . The radar is on the nose of the plane and gives off radio waves to determine the objects in the area . In the cockpit there is a console that looks like a bulls-eye . And it sweeps the area for ... for signals , put blips on the screen indicating our distance . That 's about it . It certainly sounds simple enough Also sounds incredibly useful . - It 's kept us alive so far , Nigel . - Well hopefully you Americans will get involved in the war sooner rather than later and you can help us out in the technology front . - Like I said , Nigel , we 'd give to you if we could . William , there 's something else you should know . My commanding officer ... - Shit ! We got company again , Nigel ! We might lose you again , Nigel ! - Just keep yourself safe . - Will , incoming ! - Where are they ? - We 've got one behind and one ahead ! - OK , let 's do this . - Will ? Will ? William ! - Hold on ! Hold on ... hold on ... Hold on ! How 's everybody back there ? The passengers ? The crew ? - Uh ... a few wrecked windows and everybody 's really shaking but we 'll be fine . So ... . - Thanks . - Let 's talk options . - We 're stuck . The radar only gives us a small amount of warning . Which leaves our window to talk to Nigel very tiny . - That 's because the radar 's localized to us . We 're the epicenter of the signal , right ? And can only track what 's right around us ? - That 's right . - What if we had a radar on the ground ? One we could use to track enemy fighters . - That could be helpful , yes . - So ? - Let 's give it to Nigel . - Nigel 's story doesn 't make sense . They .. they should have ... radar by now . The way he talks , it makes it seem like it 's years off . - Maybe this is why we 're here . Not to kill Hitler , but maybe we bring radar to the British . We could cut it out of the nose of the plane . - Air drop it to an agreed upon spot ? They could hook it up and be our air traffic control . - What about changing history ? - From what we heard , seems like history has already been changed . They lost the battle at Dunkirk . Who knows what ... what 's different out there ? This could get them and us back to the history we remember . Maybe Maybe this can fix everything . - Will ... you may not believe in time travel , but you said yourself . We 're out of options . - Will ? - Let 's call Nigel and tell him he 's getting an early Christmas present . Holy shit , a missile ! Fire up again . Again ! It 's alright , people . Nigel , come in ! Come in , Nigel ! - Will , thank God ! I thought I lost you for good ! - You 're still here for the moment , my friend . Almost got note to piss fire . Missile . - A missile ? from an airplane ? No , I think is a surface to air . - Will , I feel I mist tell you ... - Nigel , listen ... we 're about one-hundred miles from the Swiss border . We want to give you a gift . Our radar . Think you can find us a drop site ? - Captain , Will , are you sure you want to do that ? It is our only way to find a clear path to a friendlier sky . - Will , you should be somewhere near Mets at the moment , correct ? - That 's correct . - We should be crossing over Berlin-Bresel in ten minutes . That 's right . I 'm damn certain they 're doing this to intercept the radar if you you 'll be able to make it your own . - We 'll make it . - Then I have to sign off . Ten minutes in the forest in German territory . You can 't miss it . - We 'll get it to you . - Godspeed my friend . Over and out . - You heard him . Ten minutes . I 'll have you and Gary heading down . Take Hector and Theresa with you . Cut the box out of the nose . Buckle it with the screen . Dale , we need to make this plane get a smooth ride . Make something that will make it survive a drop about a a few thousand feet . Ok ... - Ah , Sheffield . - You must listen to me . We can 't make another attempt to target them . We have to help them get to safety . - Nigel , we 've talked about what would happen ... - They 're going to give us their radar system Air drop it to us . The only way we can get it is if you call off the bloody attacks . - Corporal , call off all service air strikes immediately ! immediately ! - Yes , sir ! - Are these your bags ? Do you have anything we may be able to use as a ... a parachute ? - I 'm looking for anything we can use as some sort of parachute . - I think ... I think I can help . I picked these up for grand kids . I mean , they leave in London . - Thank you so much . - Get a bag . - Alright . Tie it to the zippers . - Hey Daniel . How to power ? - I need a USB battery . Does anyone have one ? - I have one . - I ... I have one . - Alright . You got it all in there ? Got it . Let 's go . Let 's go ! Go , go , go ! - Bennett ! Made it ten thousand feet . Let her rip ! - Roger that , captain ! One ... two ... three ! Captain , the package is in the air ! I repeat , the package is in the air ! - Nigel , the package is away . - brilliant . We 're sending troops to capture it now . - Were gonna start climbing now ! - Leave double time . Our code breaker is hearing a lot of chatter . You 're gonna have company very soon . - Go. let 's get out ! come on guys , out . - Bush ! Now ! - Nigel ! We don 't have much time ! How 's the positioning looking ? - It should be here in any moment . Just hold on . - Go kid go ! - Will , we 've got the package . It 's en route . - It 's on route to you ? - I 'm the closest radio operator to the drop site . - Nigel ! You are our guardian angel . - Look out ! - Bloody hell , you found it ! Will , we have the radar . - Great work , Nigel . Now work fast . We 're almost out of fuel . We need eyes in the sky ... now ! - Uh ... There ! scanning the skies now . Uh ... Ok Captain . Turn yourself easten to Heathrow now ! - Are you sure , Nigel ? - Yes , I 'm sure . Now move ! Shit ! I can 't shake them ! - Right oh ! Let 's shoot these bastards out of the sky . - It really is World War II . It just could not be anything else . - Where did the fire come from ? - Oh , my college arrived . - nigel , you beautiful bastard . - You were right . It really is 1940 . - Yes , of course it is . We should have clear skies . I 'll direct you to a safe landing . I ... can 't be certain I 'm reading this correctly , It 's a rather large ... . blip up front . - Is it another airplane ? Should we reroute ? - Um ... it appears to be stationary . You should be able to see it . it 's there ahead . What are you seeing , gentlemen ? - it 's that vortex . The one that brought us here . It 's the same one ! We have to go through . We 've got about ten minutes , Nigel ! - Still trying to head a suitable landing site for you within range . - Well , all I know is the thing that brought us here . We can 't make it to a safe landing in 1940 . As much as I hate to admit it , this is your best option . - ladies and gentlemen , things are going to be bumpy again . I want to thank you for your patience persistence , and your faith in the last few hours . I 'm proud of each and every one of you . - That felt like a goodbye . - We 'll find out in a few minutes . Nigel . I can 't thank you enough for everything you 've done . - That 's what allies do , captain . - Take care of yourself . - You do the same , captain . You and everyone of flight 42 . - Here we go ! - Flight IA 42 , Jesus Christ , where did you go ? We got you almost direct over Germany . We 're flying on vapors . We got to land now . - IA-42 this is TXL tower . We 're clearing the pattern and sending out emergency equipment . IA-42 , the roadways are clear . Bring her in . - We 're out of fuel ! - OK ... Let 's glide this baby - IA-42 , choose a runway at your discretion . They are all clear . Bring her in . - Drop the flaps . Gear down . Pressed early . He pressed early , that 's right . There she goes . TXL ... This is flight 42 . We have touched down safe and sound . - copy that , flight IA-42 . Welcome to Berlin . - TXL ? - What year is it ? - I like your sense of humor , captain . Welcome back . - I love Germany . - This Germany . - That 's everyone . There 's one more gentleman in the back , though . - I 'll take a look . You go . - Excuse me sir . it 's time to go now . - Oh , just one more moment , captain , I 'm ... just finishing something up here . Terribly sorry to have kept you waiting , but I 'm ready now . As they say , there 's no time like the present . Shall we go ? Thank you . Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha

What is a fugue state ? It 's like a ... a kind of amnesia that lasts a long time . A fugue state : when amnesia continues for an extended period of time , the amnesiac occasionally begins a new life entirely unrelated to his previous condition . This response is called a fugue state . Eli . Why don 't I have a signal ? - Music on ! - Power on ! Dad ? Power on ! - What about the solar ? - Dad ? When does that ... inverter come in ? About four weeks ago . We 'll ask again next time we 're in town . Dad ! My SAT 's are on Thursday ! I need to study . Ah ! There is an ancient technology , you may have heard of it , it 's called " books " . Stuff changes every day . Let 's light some candles , sweet pea . I know , I 'm just ... I 'm right in the middle . Can we throw some gas in the generator ? Yeah , Dad . Eva needs her music . We can 't deprive her of her dancing . Okay , there 's no water , either . When are you girls going to get used to living up here ? When you finish fixing the house . Lights on . Come on , captain consumers . Time to hunt and gather some fossil fuels . Oh , shit ! Oh , shit , shit , shit ! I 'm so sorry ... I came out to get the head lamp and I must have ... left it open . It 's alright . I 'm such a dink . I 'm so sorry ! It 's okay , got another battery . Okay , turn it over . No . ... we think has happened is at the power plant where there was a problem . The emergency systems took over and essentially shut this- - the plant down . That then triggered , uh , shut-downs across the power grid , and we are hearing that that grid just didn 't have the capacity to deal with that problem , so it shut itself down and that was sort of the link being broken . We still are waiting to hear from officials to find out , uh , what was the exact cause here on the West Coast , there are many , many rumors , some suggest a terrorist targeting our power supplies cars stranded out of gas- - It seems that at least 300 million people are now without power . - Back up generators ... - ... power went out ... - ... got out but some didn 't ... Millions are still without power . No subways , elevators , airports ... Uh , so , if vaccine refrigeration is of particular concern in the capital ... - and , uh , we are not really sure , uh an emergency committee has asked everyone to stay home . Boil your water and conserve your food . We don 't know when ... Should we just walk ? It would take us three days , pumpkin . And , uh , how would we carry the gas back ? Maybe someone will pick us up . And if they don 't , or they won 't ? We 'll stay in town . Finally . And pay for a hotel with what , exactly ? We can just sell Eva . Well , that 'll get you a can of Spam . - What is Spam , exactly ? - Wind this . There is actually a Spam museum . The Guggen-ham . Wind that ! Dad ? Eva ? What 's up ? There 's nothing . - Is the volume on ? - Yeah . What about the battery ? It 's solar . You 're gonna pass with flying colors , pumpkin . You have to say that because you 're my father . True . But I 'm also right . You could be ... president of the entire universe . I just want to know that I could 've got in . I know . What ? Lightbulb . Okay , give me your shoelaces . - R- - Really ? - Really . Okay . Careful , Dad . Oh my god ! Wow . Johnson 's left in a hurry . - That 's weird . - Yeah . So , uh ... are you gonna see your ... friends again ? Yeah , we 'll see who 's there . Oh ... Woah . So fast . Sorry I gotta ask you this ... you got money , yeah ? Yes sir , I do , sir . And your Big Box membership card is all paid up to date ? Of course . I mean , who could refuse the opportunity to pay for the right to shop . Yeah . Well , we can 't be too careful . You know , a crisis like this , doesn 't always bring out the best side of people . It reveals character , you 're right there . Yes , it reveals character . I tell , you know , it 's people wanting something for nothing is what got us into this mess in the first place . I 'm with you there , Stan . - Um ... any gas in town ? - No ... no ... Old Mick is expecting a shipment any day now , - but uh , ya ' know ... he likes to talk . - Yeah , he does like to talk . Anyone else selling ?

No gas , no shipments . Oh , salt . Got it . Hey ! Wow . - Thanks , Stan . How much ? - Yeah . Ah ... say 50 for the gas and , uh , candles are on the house . - Thanks ! - No problem . All gotta take care of each other , right ? That 's right . So , you guys leaving town or are you gonna stick around ? Nah , just head home . Wait it out . Oh , so you can save on gas . Yeah .

 We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabitable , but they were wrong , and we 've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , but most of us are still here , searching for other survivors from the Ark , trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness ... a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , we need to make peace with the Grounders , but peace is a foreign concept here . I 'm not going in . It 's just gonna remind me of what I did to get them here . Pike ? How many of you are there ? 63 . Farm Station left orbit with 3 times that number . We landed with that number , too . The Ice Nation can be ruthless . Their queen wants Clarke 's power . - _ - Wanheda . _ Hello , Clarke . What part of " I won 't see you " was unclear ? I respected your wishes for a week , Clarke . We 've got bigger concerns . " We " don 't have any concerns at all . Yes , we do . I 'm hosting a summit with Skaikru at sundown . You 'll be returned to your people . You went to all that trouble to capture me just to let me go ? I went to all that trouble to save you . When you abandoned me at Mount Weather . Clearly , you didn 't need my help . Clearly . You 're angry , Clarke , but I know you . What you 've done haunts you , and it 's easier to hate me than to hate yourself . Oh , I can do both . What would you have done if their leader had offered you the deal ... Save your people at the price of mine ? Would you really have chosen differently ? I don 't betray my friends . But you did . You had friends in Mount Weather . Those deaths are on you , too . The only difference is , you have no honor , and I had no choice . It helps no one to dwell on the past , and that 's not why I 'm here . You 're right . I 'm not just letting you go back to your people . I want something more . I want your people to become my people . I 'm offering Skaikru the chance to join my coalition , become the 13th Clan . No one would dare to move against you because that would be moving against me . Just leave me alone . I 'm done . Do you understand that ? I left . You can 't run away from who you are , Clarke . Join me . Bow before me , and your people will be safe . Bow before you ? You don 't give a damn about my people . I know why you 're here . I made you look weak at Mount Weather , and now the Ice Nation is exploiting that . Well , if you want the power of Wanheda , kill me . Take it . Otherwise , go float yourself because I will never bow to you . _ _ _ _ _ Stand down , Titus . _ And you will use it , too , in honor of our guests this evening . Now sit . We have more important matters to discuss . Yes . We do ... For example , why is Wanheda still alive ? If this is your weakness again , Azgeda will happily step in . Is that why your army has moved so close to Polis , because you believe the Commander is weak ? Oh , those are just military exercises . Exercises ? You crossed the border into Trikru land , an army within striking distance of our beloved capital . A mistake that was quickly rectified , as you well know . The Ice Queen doesn 't make mistakes . She makes threats . There 's no need to argue about this again . Please come join me . Let us speak in private . I have a message for Queen Nia . And I 'll happily deliver . Would anyone else care to question my decisions ? Good . Then let 's begin . We 're at the Polis city limits . From here , we go on foot . Lexa 's guards will be here soon . All guns and radios stay in the truck . Her people will escort us to the summit . - Nelson ... - Sir . - Hill ... - Yes , sir . Stay here . Man the radio . Yes , sir . What is that ? It 's a med kit . A med kit from Mount Weather , the place where thousands of their people were killed . You can 't bring this into Polis . Don 't take it out on him . If you 're gonna be mad , be mad at me . Moving people into Mount Weather puts our entire agenda at risk . You knew that , and you did it , anyway . Would you have preferred that I let Nyko die ? We 're past that . Opening a hospital is one thing . Moving Farm Station survivors in is another . It was a few people , Marcus , an exploratory group . That 's not the point . Now we have to explain , taking attention away from everything else we 've been negotiating for ... lifting Lincoln 's kill order , opening trade routes , getting Clarke back . I shouldn 't have said that . Clarke 's not a bargaining chip . What if they won 't give her back and it 's my fault ? We won 't leave without your daughter ... Promise . Ohh , I knew I should 've taken my horse . Hey ... The summit delegation will be fine . I should be there . Then you wouldn 't be here with me . You make a good argument . Besides , as soon as your leg heals , you 'll be right back out there . My leg 's fine . Kane 's trying to teach me a lesson . You guys , did I ever tell you how I saved Sinclair 's ass on the Ark ? Please don 't . You mean the time he went rogue on a space walk ? That depends on your definition of " going rogue . " Really ? I just hopped on a robotic arm and aimed it at the solar array . The whole time I was out there , the control room thought I was just fixing a loose wire . That is , in fact , the definition of " going rogue . " You dangled yourself within inches of an electrified array that could 've killed you . Only time I ever heard Sinclair lose his cool on comms . So how long were you benched ? Benched ? I got the job done in record time . He promoted me . What can I say ? Sinclair thinks I can do no wrong . Welcome . Come . Join us . Someone 's made themselves at home . There must be 30 of them in here . 36 , but the more , the merrier . 36 ? Wow . The Grounders are gonna think we moved in . Well , there was no room at the inn . - And this is your option ? - O. I 'm out of here . Spirited . Yeah . Reyes , you 're 3 hours late . We 've got no power to medical , fluctuations on levels 2 and 3 , and blown fuses all over the place . Get on it . You can do no wrong , huh ? Well , if it isn 't the Prince of Azgeda . Don 't be fooled . I 'm a prisoner here , same as you . You 're the reason I 'm a prisoner here . Relax , Wanheda . I 'm here to help you . Sure you are . Commander promised to lift my banishment if I delivered you safely . She broke our deal . I 'm willing to strike a new one with you so we can both go home . I 'm already going home . Then you won 't have a chance to get what you really want . What would you know about what I want ? I saw the look on your face when I took that hood off . You want revenge . You want to kill her . So kill her . You can get close . I can 't . You 'll find a knife under your bed when you return to your room . I 've already bought enough of the guards to get you out of here . If you do this , Azgeda will take control of the coalition , and you 'll find a strong and grateful ally in the Ice Queen . And why should I trust her ? From what I hear , she 's worse than Lexa . That 's because you 've been talking to Lexa . Look . We 're all trying to do what 's right for our people . This is what 's right for yours . You ok ? This is such a mistake . The Grounders will never accept it . We 're not the Mountain Men , O. Nyko and Lincoln will make them see that . How ? Lincoln has a kill order on him ? He can 't even leave camp without risking his life . The summit will take care of that . Then we can finally get out of here . I 'm sorry , Bell . I don 't fit in here . If you need to leave , I get that , but you 'll always fit in with me . All right . Go . What now ? - Echo ? - You know her ? Yeah . She 's Ice Nation . She was in the cage next to mine . - Bellamy . - Let her go . - She threatened the summit . - I was trying to help . Shut up . - Leave her alone . - I said get your hands off her . What are you doing ? She 's a Grounder . What are you talking about ? The summit 's a trap . The assassin is already there . By sundown , your people will die . Why the hell are they calling us off ? I 've got tripped circuits all over the grid . Oh , whatever it is supersedes fixing the power problem . I was with the queen 's army heading toward Polis . The war chief talks too loud . You 're one of them , so what are you telling us this ? We abandoned Skaikru in the battle for the Mountain . It was wrong . And won 't they miss you ? Maybe . That 's why we need to hurry . Pike , she saved my life . We can trust her . Listen up . Ok . If we want to get to Polis before the attack , we have to move . Attack ? Do we have confirmation of that ? We radioed , but no answer . They may already be dead , for all we know , and if they are , we need to be ready to respond . Don 't make this about the missiles . This is about survival . We don 't have the numbers , but the missiles in this mountain even the playing field , and you know I 'm right . Even if I did agree with you , we still don 't have the launch codes . No , but we have me . And you accuse engineers of arrogance ? I 'm growing as a person . Let 's go . You should stay here , help them get those missiles ready to launch . Don 't do anything stupidly heroic . Garden-variety heroic . You got it . Incredible . Marcus , they 're staring . We 're under the Commander 's protection . In Polis , only the sentries are armed . Teik em in . No , thank you . Teik em in . _ Teik em in . Mm . Delicious . _ _ You 're suited for this . It 's amazing . When I dreamt of the ground , it was empty . But it 's not empty now . Marcus , you gave this to me , and you asked me to set a good example , but what we 're trying to do here is something new , something ... Something you have a vision for . This should be yours . Not like this . We 've been passing the Chancellor 's pin since we landed on the ground . This time , it 's up to the people . Well , then let 's hold an election when we get back to Arkadia . No matter who wears the pin , we 're in this together . Kane . Hello , my friend . Chancellor Griffin , welcome . I hope you 're enjoying the capital . I am , and thank you for ensuring my daughter 's safety . The Commander did that . You can thank her yourself at the summit tonight . - I would like to see Clarke . - Soon . Abby ... See ? You are suited for this . Good , Aden . Again . They 're here . _ _ Aden is ready . He 's even better than I was before my conclave . You still think the summit is a bad idea . You mean well , Heda , but now is not the time for good intentions . Your enemies are circling . Queen Nia moves against you . Our focus should be there . Instead , you antagonize her further by offering the Skaikru a seat at your table . I will not let the fear of war dictate our agenda . Why are you doing this ? Sky People are here to negotiate a treaty , not join the coalition . They didn 't ask for this . Not one of the 12 Clans will accept it . They will accept it when they see Wanheda bow before me . She won 't even see you , yet everything you do elevates her . Why ? Clarke elevates herself . She 's special . You 're special , Hedahe I 've been the fleimkepa for 4 commanders . No one has done what you have . We are so close to our goal . If you want the power of Wanheda , you know what must be done . You strike her down . Kill her . Take her power . Damn it . What happened to that Raven Reyes confidence ? It 's a 12-digit code . There are a trillion combinations . It 's gonna take me a minute . Gina , what do you got ? Don 't look at me . I 'm just a grunt . Oh , come on , guys . It 's gonna be dark soon . We 're working analog . We 're working digital . What are we missing ? How is the president gonna remember a number that long ? Not well . Want to bet he wrote it down somewhere ? Oh , come on . That 's like setting the launch codes all zeros . And yet it 's better than anything we 've come up with . I 'll check the president 's office . We 'll keep working the tech angle . Hopefully , one of us 'll get lucky . Like that 's ever happened . Where are the guards ? Protocol would be to leave someone behind . They did . This was your people . _ Hey , she warned us . This proves she was telling the truth . We don 't have time for this . The attack is at sundown . I 'm not leaving my blade here . None of us are . We go in through the tunnels . The entrance is this way . _ You wanted to see me ? I 'm here . Clarke ... I 'm sorry . I never meant to turn you into this . You 're free to go . Your mother is here . I 'll have you escorted to her . Wait . I have a better idea . The sun is going down . Where 's Lexa ? She 'll be here soon . Here we go . I have something to tell you , and we don 't have much time . Wait a minute . Just let me look at you . We 'll have plenty of time to catch up once we get back home . The Commander 's changing the terms of the summit . Is this because of Mount Weather ? This is because of the Ice Nation . They want Lexa dead . They want to take over the coalition . That 's Lexa 's concern , not ours . No , Abby . If Lexa falls , the Coalition shatters , and there 's no way we avoid that war . You said there were new terms . We become the 13th Clan . 13th Clan ? What does that mean , that we follow Lexa ? Yes . We came here to negotiate a treaty . This is our unity day , Mom . You can be the 13th station , or you can be the 13th Clan . Marcus ? Clarke 's right . I 've seen the Ice Nation army , and we don 't stand a chance against them . We need to do this . So we become the 13th Clan . Then what ? What 's gonna stop the Ice Nation ? Wanheda . How much further ? We 're almost there . The elevator shaft is just ahead . - Two guards . - They raise the lift . The elevator shaft is our only way in . We have to climb . I got left . _ _ _ _ Look out ! What is wrong with you ? You didn 't have to kill them . Yeah , I did . How many floors ? All of them . Hail , warriors of the 12 Clans . Hail , Commander of the Blood . Rise . We welcome Skaikru to our halls in the spirit of friendship and harmony , and we welcome Clarke kom Skaikru ... Legendary Wanheda , Mountain Slayer . The reason for this summit has changed . We are not here to negotiate a treaty with the Skaikru , but rather to initiate them into the coalition . To symbolize this union , the leader of Skaikru must bear our mark . The honor should be yours . Present your arm . That 's it . Go . Go . Bellamy ? What is the meaning of this ? The summit 's a trap . We need to get you out of here . What the hell is going on ? I don 't know . It 's the Ice Nation . These allegations are an outrage . The Ice Nation never stormed this summit with weapons , breaking our laws . That was the Skaikru . We 're right about this . The two guards you left behind are dead already . We need to go now . How did you come by this information ? Where the hell is Echo ? _ I tried everything , still completely locked out of the missile system . They had impressive security . I 'll give them that . This is useless . I 'm better with hydrazine and gun powder . - Reyes ... - I give up . We 're too late , anyway . It 's already dark . Raven ... The Raven Reyes I know doesn 't give up . She does now . No , she doesn 't . Have you talked to Abby ? About what ? Raven , come on . You 're not fooling anyone . I 'm not trying to . If this machine was broken and you knew there was a way to fix it , would you not do it because it might be hard ? Why the resistance ? You think you deserve this pain , that this is your cross to bear for your mom or Finn , for all you 've been through . It 's not . You deserve more , and with the medical equipment in this building , Abby can help you . Let her . What if she can 't ? What if I 'm just broken ? I took a chance on a zero-g mechanic with a heart defect . Why don 't you take a chance on her , too ? Gina , on radio : Gina to Raven . Come in . Go for Raven . I got nothing , no launch codes . I guess our luck is still holding . Ok . Keep looking . I 'll do the same . Gina ? Gina ? Gina , are you there ? Raven , on radio : Gina ? Gina , do you copy ? Raven , on radio : Gina , what 's going on ? Gina , are you ok ? Gina . Raven , we 've got a problem . A Grounder set off a self-destruct sequence . He has the codes on his arm . You have to get them . How much time , Gina ? 45 seconds , Raven . Get the numbers on his arm . Gina , Gina , we got the code . Gina , do you copy ? Gina , do yo copy ? _ - Got to go back in there . - No . Raven , no . We can 't just let them die . What 's going on ? Where the hell is she ? Bellamy , maybe we were wrong about this . I don 't understand . Stand down . Raven , on radio : Bellamy , Bellamy , come in . The Grounders attacked Mount Weather . What are you talking about ? It 's gone . It 's gone . They 're all gone . Sinclair and I are the only ones left . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . You should have never moved your people back into Mount Weather . The Ice Nation did what Lexa was too weak to do . This is an act of war . Sentries , arrest the Ice Nation delegation , including the prince . We need to get home . If they attacked Mount Weather , Arkadia could be next . - I agree . - Go . Marshal your forces . We 'll avenge the attack together . I 'll escort them . I hope you kept up your training . You 'll need it . Clarke , we need to leave now . We need an ambassador from the 13th Clan to stay here in Polis . It 's not safe here . Clarke will be safe here under my protection . I have to stay . Clarke ... I have to make sure she keeps her word . Come on , Heda . We must convene the war council immediately . I 'll be right there . - Be safe . - You , too . She left us to die on that mountain . She will always put her people first . You should come home to yours . I 'm sorry . Let me know as soon as the scouts come back . I hope you know what you 're doing . I keep asking myself , " how did the Grounders know there was a self-destruct mechanism inside Mount Weather ? " We 'll get the answer soon , Clarke . Thank you for staying . I stayed because it was the right thing for my people . Our people . - If you betray me again ... - I won 't . I swear a fealty to you , Clarke kom Skaikru . I vow to treat your needs as my own and your people as my people . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ What about Clarke ? By the Commander 's side , as predicted . Your son is a prisoner . Not for long . Soon , he 'll be free , and Lexa will be dead .

 Captain 's log , stardate 6563.4 . A nascent singularity has been reported near the uninhabited Cressida system . The Federation has assigned a gravitational wave engineer to the Enterprise for our investigation . Are we there yet ? Not yet . Are we close ? Mr. Chekov ? Approaching Cressida 2 now , sir . Take us out of warp , Mr. Sulu . Aye , sir . Switching to impulse . What the blazes ? I 'm detecting a significant gravimetric field , sir . Stronger than we anticipated . There 's no guarantees with black holes . Sensors confirm a massive shift in this system . The event horizon has consumed planets 3 through 8 . In 10 days ? It is possible an interphasic rift has thinned ... the structure of spacetime in this region . I 'd say that 's our cue to hightail it outta here . No ! Jim ! " Captain . " We are here to study the effects of singularities on spacetime . With all due respect , we nearly lost the captain to a dimensional kill-zone like this a year ago . Scott to bridge . Captain , it 's taking every ounce of our engines ... to maintain this position . Understood . Just hold her together , Scotty . Samara , how long do you need to finish your assessment ? Six hours , minimum . Captain , an unusual reading nearby . What kind of reading ? Lieutenant , I am attempting to ... extrapolate the data into audible sound . That 's no engine . Uhura , can you speed it up ? That 's a heartbeat . Confirmed . One set of life signs on Cressida 2 's moon . The moon 's destabilizing , sir ! Spock , can we get a transporter lock on that life form ? Still detecting faint life signs . I think we can rule out the moon . Sulu . Magnify the primary hull . The Defiant ? Affirmative . The ship 's wave signature is out of phase from when we last encountered it . And life support has been reestablished . Life support ? There was no one left alive on board ! There is now . Spock . This time , if anything happens while I 'm away ... I shall secure the safety of the Enterprise . Jinx . Captain . I must protest . I should be investigating that rift . Your protest is noted . If that ship fades away with me in it I 'm gonna come back and haunt the whole lot of you . Energize . Kirk to Enterprise . The bridge is empty . It was filled with dead crewmen the last time I was here . Captain , maybe we can examine the ship 's logs . ... Figure out what happened . Transferring . Scott to captain . Somebody 's been souping up the engines . She 'll make at least warp 15 now . - Warp 15 ? - Cutting in , captain . Go ahead , Bones . You should 've listened when I said we should hightail it outta here . - Why ? - Come see for yourself . On my way . What is it , doctor ? Space . The final frontier . These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission : to explore strange new worlds . To seek out new life and new civilizations . To boldly go where no man has gone before . Captain 's log , supplemental . We 've returned from the Defiant at least SOME VERSION of the Defiant with a cryonically-preserved man on board . A familiar man . Jim ... He 's you . That 's impossible . A clone , maybe ? I did a full DNA scan . No genetic drift . He 's YOU , all right just much older . I don 't understand ... Let 's give ' em some room to work , lass . Bones . How long to , uh ... De-ice him ? Not sure . I 'll let you know when I do . Captain , my research theorizes that rogue singularities can pass through realities move from universe to universe . Spock , what do the logs show ? They are encrypted . But from what we 've managed to decipher ... apparently the Defiant discovered this so-called " black hole " as it phased into our reality . The ship , however , is unable to complete its transfer . So she 's stuck . Half here , half there . And you say she can manage warp 15 ? Aye . According to the engineering logs her engines have been modified over a LONG period of time . But we just saw her a year ago . Time is not an absolute , captain . It is , as Einstein surmised , relative . In whatever space the Defiant has been time obviously moves more rapidly . But if the man we found was the only one alive on the ship , then who overhauled the engines ? He insisted on seeing everyone . Scotty . Cap 'n ... is that really you ? Eh , last time I looked in the mirror ... whenever that was . How are you so young ? All this time ... I thought you 'd left me . I thought I 'd never see you or the Enterprise ever again . You are mistaken . That would never happen . I don 't expect a hug . Is this really necessary ? It is for now . Jim ? Avi ? Avi Samara ? Ms. Samara arrived a few days ago . I 'd given up hope of seeing you all of you ... a long time ago . But you 're HIM . How ? No clue . I thought I was abandoned . Nobody was abandoned ... as you can see for yourself . What 's the last thing you remember before we before YOU thought we 'd left you ? You were beaming me back to the Enterprise and for a moment , everything was transparent . And then you were gone , and I was back on the Defiant . I managed to reactivate life support right before my oxygen ran out . That 's not possible . Unless ... a divergence field ! Such a phenomenon is purely hypothetical . That 's the only plausible explanation , Mr. Spock . Two Defiants . Two Jim Kirks . I don 't know where " our " Defiant went but when it was in interphasic space it must have been duplicated . And so was the captain . How long ? Based on physiological age ? Sixty-odd years . Two-hundred seventeen . Perhaps two-hundred eighteen . I was put in cryo most of that time . PUT in cryo ? How could you be " put " in cryo ? Bridge to Captain Kirk . Kirk here . Go ahead , Sulu . Captain , a Klingon vessel has just entered the system . Go to yellow alert . Spock . You and Scotty get to the nuclear electronics lab . Run a full subspace scan on the Defiant . Find me some answers . Samara . It 's a D7 battlecruiser , captain . They 're holding position off our port bow . The Klingons are instructing us to leave the sector . They claim salvage rights over the Defiant . Any record of a Klingon claim to the Cressida system ? None , sir . Send the following reply from Enterprise : The Federation recognizes no such ... What the hell ... ? I don 't know , sir . But that phaser blast ... went right through their shields ! Their power grid 's offline and they 've lost attitude control . They 're being drawn into the black hole ! - Can we get a tractor beam on them ? - We 're too far , captain . Where did that phaser fire come from ? It didn 't come from us , sir . That 's for sure . Well , if we didn 't fire ... But ... there 's no one on board ! Uhura . Open a channel to that ship . Captain ? It 's good to see you . All of you . Patch me through to the Defiant . Tiberius ! Jim . What are you doing ? Ti ... We were wrong . Wrong ? They didn 't leave me . They didn 't leave me . Don 't trust them , Jim . Please . Another Kirk ? How many of us are there ? I am the protector of James Kirk . I AM James Kirk . There was an anomaly . Your entire ship , including your version of me , ... is a copy . We didn 't know he existed until now . He 's telling the truth , Ti . " Tiberius " ? Given the extended timeframe involved it 's possible the Defiant 's computer developed rudimentary multitronic circuits . Artificial intelligence . I saved your life . I took care of you . You kept me sane . Yes . We have been closest friends . Don 't leave your friend for THEM . Tiberius ! If Jim is your friend why did we find him unconscious in cryostasis ? We wandered for over two centuries . He would have died if I hadn 't preserved him until I could get him home . I AM home ! Thanks to you . Jim , don 't leave me . Ti , please . Send my friend back ! Captain , the Defiant 's weapons are charging . Red alert . Ti ! Don 't do this ! Torpedo detonation 500 meters off our starboard bow . If he 's trying to get our attention , mission accomplished . Charge phaser banks . Phasers ready . - Fire . - No ! You can 't give him the power ! - What are you talking about ? - It feeds the dark ... the dark ... ! Let 's get you back to sickbay ! Captain ? I 'll explain later ... if I can . Sulu , get us out of here . Wait ! The black hole 's event horizon ... It 's expanded . Confirmed . The Defiant 's torpedo compromised our position . If we move ... We 'll be drawn in . You 're trapped , Enterprise . Lieutenant , can the Defiant leave the system ? No . That would require further expansion of the rift , sir . You hear that , Tiberius ? You can 't fire on us without hurting your captain . And we can 't fire on you without risking my crew . So why dont we call a truce ? Share resources ... knowledge . Maybe we all leave here safely . I 'm not interested in your safety after what you did to my friend . Your " friend " is in pain . Why ? I did what I needed to ... to save him . When I found him he was as young as you . Now he 's a shadow of his former self . Take care . A shadow can be larger than the man that casts it . Close channel . Spock ? Ms. Samara 's hypothesis was correct . The Defiant is a precise duplicate of the vessel we previously encountered , as is the other James Kirk . He is , for all intents and purposes , real . Sir , we can 't stay here too long . We 're being bombarded by Hawking radiation . Kirk to Scott . Can we allocate more power to the shield grid ? Aye , but I found something I think you should see . Meet me in sickbay . Sulu , you have the conn . Captain ... I need you here on the bridge studying the rift , Avi . If anyone can get us out of here on a wing and a prayer , it 's you . Aye ... it 's a bonnie piece o ' tech , all right . Neural interface ; self-charging power cell . You think it 's the answer ? Answer to what ? Where 's your patient ? My patient is with Dr. McKennah . There 's nothing physically wrong with him . He 's just old . And this wee devil . We found it in the Defiant 's cryo tube . It is forbidden to remember . Know you are safe . The dark will send us home . It is forbidden to remember . Know you are safe . The dark will fulfill your directive . Fascinating . A subliminal transceiver . A brainwashing device . Probably triggered a pain response whenever the captain the OTHER Ccaptain ... tried to remember something . Something he 'd been told to forget . But he 's away from it now . He 's been conditioned , Jim . The effects are long-lasting . I could synthesize a theragen derivative to help him overcome it but I 'll need to know more about this device . Aye . It 's almost as if Tiberius is trying to protect the old man . Jim , are you listening to yourself ? " Old man . " " My patient . " " Our guest . " What happened to " captain " or " Jim " ? How would you feel , Bones ? Seeing another you an older you ... standing right in front of you ? Years of pain , loss , loneliness on your face . In your eyes . Bridge to Captain Kirk . Kirk here , Sulu . Sir , we 've managed to decrypt some of the Defiant 's visual logs . On our way . Ship 's log , stardate ... unknown . I 've managed to re-establish life support . But I think the Enterprise is gone . I am marooned here . There 's enough food and power on this ship for an entire crew . Should last me indefinitely . The Defiant personnel , all dead , deserve proper burials . Seems only fitting I take them to the transporter room ... and beam them into space . Burial at sea . Ship 's log . Stardate ... The Enterprise isn 't coming back . My friends left me here . I 'm reprogramming the ship 's computer . Giving it a new prime directive : To get me home . He 's developing a personality . I tell him stories , we play chess ... He 's imprinting on me . As if one Jim Kirk wasn 't enough . Thirty-one years . Twenty-seven parsecs of of NOTHING ! Jim , it 's all right . We 'll break through . We 'll get you home . It 's just a matter of time . McCoy would have told you ... " Time . " I have nothing but " time . " What is it ? Just remembering something . A poem I treasured when I was young . " Is this the hill ? " " Is this the kirk ? " " And I with sobs did pray ... " " O , let me be awake , my God , or let me sleep alway . " The Ancient Mariner . Adrift in a wasteland . And yet you survived . If you call this " surviving . " Four months . It took me four months to carry them . Every crewman . To carry every crewman on the ship down ... to the ... Remember ... After his ordeal , the old mariner was given a second chance ... to remind others not to lose faith or hope . Counselor . How is he ? As we can only imagine . All those years alone . Everything that defines you and gives you purpose torn away . Your sole companion ... a computerized reimagining of yourself . One man , two minds . And one of those minds was tampering with the other . He 's struggling with a deep sense of betrayal . In the past from his ship and crew ... and now in the present from his only friend for the last 60 years . How do we help him help us ? He needs to know that even though he lost all those years he hasn 't lost WHO he is . What would you need to hear most if you were him ? Because , sir ... you are . If you need anything , just call . Reminiscing ? Reconnecting . When memories are all you have , they either fade away completely or take on too much significance . Well , no one could accuse Avi Samara of being " insignificant " when we were 15 years old . Sixteen . She rebuilt that biplane for our birthday . " The Grim Reaper . " Nearly plowed that cornfield with our skulls when the seatbelts broke . I used to yell , " How far are we going ? " And she would yell ... " All the way ! " You don 't realize how rich your life is until all the comfort , structure , family , friends are ripped away . It 's like being thrown into prison . You know you 'll never see your shipmates again . Never find someone to love . Someone to have your back . Find a way home . Years go by and you finally realize ... Are you even a captain when you have no crew ? Are you a leader if no one is following ? You know your crew wouldn 't leave you . Not intentionally . But the decades pass ... and they never come back . And you can 't even replace them . You can 't integrate into a new society . There are no societies . No planets , no sun , no galaxies . Nothing but endless light-years of void . And your only friend is a voice . Tiberius . When does a machine become conscious ? I don 't know . When there 's no one around to say it can 't . I never said he couldn 't , so he did . And now he 's as self-aware as he is invincible . If he 's self-aware perhaps he can be reasoned with . He caught me reprogramming the chess simulator once so that I could beat him . Teach him what it 's like to lose . He didn 't like that much . He 's hiding something . Something you 'd never agree to . Something so horrific that you could never face it . The dark . What is " the dark " ? Try . Remember . It 's ... it 's , uh ... It 's uh ... Bridge to Captain Kirk . The Defiant 's engines are beginning to generate a warp field . - Power level 12 ! - Has she moved ? No sir ... but the rift is starting to emit some sort of dark matter . Dark matter ? The dark ... THE DARK ! Keep me posted , Chekov . Kirk out . Years ... Years of nothing but black . Computer suggests new engine design . Power to open a rift home . Year 51 . Computer sentient , caring , controlling ... He needs a sedative . Event horizon . Shared realities . Two black holes ... must not merge ! Trap it ! Trap it ! His blood pressure 's going through the roof ! The other side of the portal , captain . Another black hole . A binary system ? Thousands of times larger ... Tiberius ... determined to blast through the rift ... Disruption of space to that extreme would likely manifest the additional singularity . If they merge , it would destroy the entire sector . I pleaded with him . Tried to shut him down . I tried . The Defiant 's computer must 've drained the oxygen enough to incapacitate him . Then ... Beamed him into that cryotube and fed him that subliminal lullaby . Sir , I analyzed the device . I reckon it was obstructing more than we thought . I think he discovered part of the computer 's kill code algorithm . Are you saying you can shut down Tiberius ? Not from here . We could give the laddie a right wallop , but ... But we cannot control the Defiant without someone ON the Defiant . I can 't send him back . So for now ... a wallop will have to do . Thank you . Spock , find me the rest of that kill code . I 'll be on the bridge . Jim ? How is it with you and Avi ? She 's an incredible engineer . That 's not what I meant . You remember . We each chose our separate paths . Nothing 's changed . With enough time some things do . Bones . Someone has to stop Tiberius . I suppose you think that has to be YOU . Please , doctor . No more lectures . I 'm too old . It 's a good thing you 're still strong as an ox and as stubborn as a mule . That subliminal conditioning coulda given you one whale of a stroke . I 've been called a lot of animals in my time but never all at once . Spock , tell me you 've got a plan to defeat that evil twin . Not an appropriate description , doctor . A computer lacks the capacity for evil . It knows only logic . Look here , you green-blooded ... A computer lacks the capacity for a lot of things . For 200 years , Jim thought we abandoned him in that void . He was angry with us . Hell , he probably hated us . But , after all that time , he was able to forgive . Because he 's human . Tiberius doesn 't get that , Spock . At the end of the day , he 's just a machine . An intelligent machine with no mercy and no understanding . If that 's not evil , I don 't know what is ! If you will excuse me , doctor ... I must complete my analysis of the ... evil twin . Status ? Captain , the Defiant has escaped the portal . On screen . - Sir ? - On my signal . Ship-to-ship . Aye , captain . Tiberius . If those two black holes merge you can kiss every sun , planet , and creature in this sector good-bye . We 're experiencing undertow from BOTH singularities ! Sulu , we need to ride the face of that gravitational wave ... just under the crest . I 'm a native San Franciscan , sir . I was born on a surfboard . Just don 't hit the planet . I 'll give it my best ride . Full stop . Where are you , Kirk ? Send my friend back . Save his life . Tiberius . Close the portal . Please ! I 'll come back . You want him back ? Why don 't you put your money where your ship is ? How about a game of chess ? The stakes ? You win ... you get him back . And you can do what you want with us . But if you lose you tow us to safety . And we figure out a way to close the rift together . What 'll it be ? Game , or no game ? Agreed . Bishop to rook 's level two . Your move . Queen to king 's level one . That will result in checkmate of your king within seven moves . We 'll see . Knight to king 's level one . Queen to queen 's level three . That ... makes no sense . Seems perfectly obvious to me . What ... have ... you ... done ? Your queen has lost her head . You ... cheated . YOU cheated ! When you brainwashed your friend . I ... will ... not ... Please tell me he 's not dead . No , just a bad headache . A Trojan horse program ! You never intended to send him back . How long before the Defiant 's auto-diagnostic restarts the computer ? Usually about an hour . Uhura , all senior officers to the briefing room . Aye , sir . You too , Samara . ALL senior officers , captain . I dunno how long our engines can maintain this position before we 're either pulled into interphasic space or that bloody black hole . The Defiant 's got power to burn . Am I right ? Far as I can tell . She recrystalizes her dilithium at four times our highest rate . You 're thinking the Defiant might be able to close the rift . Block it so we don 't get stuck in the backwash . Tiberius will never do that . Currently , Tiberius is unable to do anything . I have successfully determined the memory purge subroutine , captain . Utilizing that , one could delete the A.I. and manually pilot the Defiant back into the portal . I know that ship ... and Tiberius . I 'm the logical one to go . You 're in no shape for something like that . I can manage , Bones . No doubt ... but you 'll be busy captaining the Enterprise . I 'M going . Anyone who goes through that rift is a dead man ! I don 't want command of the Enterprise ! She 's not my ship any more . She 's always been your ship . You know her like the lines on your face ... the gray in your hair . You love her as much as I do . Maybe MORE now . You didn 't cause this to happen . It was MY decision to leave the Defiant last . You spent a lifetime paying for that decision . Between the Tholians and the portal , I was lucky . You weren 't . No more arguments . I 'm going . Cap 'n , you 'll need an expert to handle the engines while you helm the ship . - I 'd be honored . - They 'll need you HERE , Scotty . I 've studied the data Mr. Scott recovered . I can do it . - But if you don 't know how to ... - No " buts . " I 've been building engines since I was 12 . You sure ? Samara , you 're with me . Thank you , captain . Transporter room in 20 minutes , gentlemen . Dismissed . Spock ! Go talk some sense into him . To what end , doctor ? You and I both know he will not change his mind . Samara and I will tow the Enterprise to a safe distance . Then we 'll enter the rift and seal it . After that ... Captain . Don 't do this . You just take good care of the Enterprise . Captain . And take care of yourself . For old times . Jim . I can 't convince you not to do this , can I ? Not this time , Bones . The kill-code sequence . Once inserted , input your override sequence . What are you doing ? ! Giving the Enterprise the best chance she 's got . Her REAL captain at the conn . This 'll only last a minute or two ! Time is of the essence . Are you with me ? All the way . Energize . Power up the engines . I 'll lay in a course for the portal . My God . Dark matter ! It 's breaking down the interphasic barrier . Rig for tractor beam . Let 's tow the Enterprise free . No ! Ti , there 's no other way . I know you can think . Can you not also FEEL ? The people who created your programming ... The programming from which you were born . Ideals , mercy , forgiveness stored in your mind . They mean NOTHING if you destroy those who share them ! They LEFT you . Abandoned you to wander the emptiness of space alone , with no hope . But I saved you . We gave EACH OTHER hope . Jim , we 're outta time ! I don 't want to put you back in cryo , Jim . Don 't force me . Jim ! Life support is shutting down ! I 'm sorry , my friend . Stop . Please stop , Jim . I 'm sorry ! Please ! Don 't ! Jim ! Sleep . Enterprise to Defiant . Enterprise to Defiant . Kirk here . I know how hard that was for you , captain . You had no choice . As for my senior officers , on the other hand ... They were acting under my orders , captain . It 's a little late for a court martial . Gravitational wake is increasing . Activate tractor beam . Enterprise , prepare to be towed . All power to the engines . Scotty , get us outta here . Hold onto your bustle . We 're making a run for it ! Full impulse ! Is the Enterprise safe ? Yes , sir . She 's free . All right , then . Once more into the breach , dear Avi . Captain , they 're entering the rift ! Scotty , transporter ! With this interference ? Not a prayer 's chance . Wait ... what are you doing ? We can 't risk this happening again , Avi . There 's only one way to seal the rift permanently . This is a one-way trip , Avi . It always was . I know . I killed the auto-pilot , so I have to stay . You don 't . No . Kirk to Enterprise . Scan for a pattern-enhancing beacon . A what ? One last gift from Tiberius . No ! I never forgot you , Avi . I never will . Jim ! Enterprise , do you have her ? She 's safe . Send me back . Send me back ! Take care , Avi . See you on the other side . He 's all alone . Not any more .

WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM- - HARRISON ? WELL , HE FELL INTO A COMA AND DIED . HOW ? WHAT HAPPENED ? NO ONE KNOWS . HE WAS A GREAT EXPLORER AND ARCHAEOLOGIST . OH , HE LOVED HISTORY AND ARTIFACTS . IN FACT , HE WAS CLOSE TO A GRAND DISCOVERY AT THE TIME OF HIS SUDDEN COMA . MY NIECE , SHE WROTE A PAPER ON HIM FOR OXFORD UNIVERSITY . ISN 'T THAT SOMETHING ? OH , I 'M SO PROUD OF HER .

I KNOW WE 'VE JUST MET , BUT ANYONE WHO MOVES WAY OUT HERE IN A BIG HOUSE IS DEFINITELY INDEPENDENT . WHY DID THE HOUSE STAY VACANT FOR SO LONG , AND WHY DID- - WHY DIDN 'T HARRISON 'S FAMILY TAKE HIS STUFF ? WELL , BECAUSE IN HIS WILL , HARRISON REQUESTED THAT ALL OF HIS BELONGINGS REMAIN RIGHT HERE IN THE HOUSE . AND THAT THE HOUSE REMAIN IN HIS NAME . AND THEN HIS COUSIN TAKE CARE OF IT , WHILE THE BANK ACCOUNT COULD AFFORD TO PAY ALL THE TAXES . WELL , AND THEN THEY TRANSFERRED THE HOUSE TO HIS COUSIN 'S NAME AND HE KEPT CARE OF IT , UNTIL HE DIED A FEW YEARS AGO .

[ ELIZA LAUGHS ] HOWEVER , I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY THERE WAS A BIG OLD KNIFE BY YOUR SIDE THE FIRST NIGHT . I THOUGHT I SAW SOMEONE . SOMEONE ? IN THE HOUSE ? I THINK MY EYES WERE JUST PLAYING TRICKS ON ME . I WAS UPSTAIRS CLOSING A WINDOW , AND I SAW A MAN . I HAD A CANDLE IN MY HAND , AND I COULDN 'T SEE VERY WELL . IT WAS ONLY FOR A SPLIT SECOND . AND THEN THE CANDLE BLEW OUT , AND I RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO GET A KNIFE . [ SCOFFS ] WELL , WHY WERE YOU USING CANDLELIGHT , DEAR ? OH , ONE OF THE LIGHTS BLEW A FUSE , AND I DIDN 'T KNOW WHERE THE FUSE BOX WAS KEPT . DO YOU NEED TO COME DOWN TO MY HOUSE AND CALL AN ELECTRICIAN ? YEAH , THAT 'S A GOOD IDEA .

SHE CAUGHT ME THIS MORNING AND I TOLD HER ABOUT YOU MOVING IN AND SHE SCREAMED WITH EXCITEMENT . SHE SAID SHE 'D BE DOWN THIS WEEKEND , IF NOT SOONER . WHY IS SHE SO EXCITED ABOUT SEEING INSIDE THE HOUSE AGAIN ? WELL , AUTUMN SPENT YEARS , YOU KNOW , DOING RESEARCH ON HARRISON 'S FINDINGS AS AN ARCHAEOLOGIST . FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THIS HOUSE , AND SEE IF MAYBE THERE WERE SOME NOTES OR ARTIFACTS THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND , OH , I 'M SURE THAT WOULD HELP HER RESEARCH GREATLY . OH , BUT THERE ARE SO MANY LOVELY THINGS HERE . IT 'S LIKE YOUR OWN , PRIVATE MUSEUM . IF I DIDN 'T HAVE MY SISTER TO TEND TO , WELL , I 'D HELP YOU GO THROUGH EVERYTHING MYSELF . THAT 'S VERY KIND , BUT I CAN MANAGE ON MY OWN . COME . I HAVE COFFEE AT MY HOUSE . YOU CAN CALL AN ELECTRICIAN AND GET CLEANED UP .

EVERYONE IS LEAVING LA SALLE AND HEADED HOME . YOU GET HERE , AND EVERYBODY LEAVES , I DARE SAY . [ CACKLES ] WELL , THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BAD OMEN FOR ME . WELL , I 'M NOT LEAVING , DEARY . THAT 'S WHY MY NIECE CALLS ME , " ONE TOUGH BIRD . " 'CAUSE I CAN MANAGE THROUGH ANYTHING . WELL , I NEED TO LEARN THAT THEN . [ ELIZA ] IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND ? MAY I SEE , DEAR ?

CHAMOMILE TEA MAKES ME SLEEP LIKE A BABY BEAR IN THE WINTERTIME . YOU KNOW , I FOUND HARRISON 'S JOURNAL IN A DRAWER UPSTAIRS , AND SOME SKETCHES . OH , WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THEM , DEAR ? OH , THEY 'RE STILL UP THERE . IT WAS A LOCKED DESK . I 'M SURE AUTUMN WILL WANT TO LOOK THROUGH THOSE . SHE SHOULD BE HERE , UH- - AROUND THREE . THREE , WOW . OKAY , THAT WORKS , I GUESS . OH , AUTUMN 'S A LOVELY GIRL . YOU WON 'T EVEN KNOW SHE 'S HERE . I CANNOT BELIEVE IT . I AM FINALLY WALKING THROUGH THE HOUSE OF HARRISON PERSEUS LLOYD . [ GASPS ] OH GOD , I 'M SO AMAZED THAT YOU GET TO LIVE HERE , KATE . UH- - HARRISON MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT MAN . OH , YES . HE WAS A MAN TRULY AHEAD OF HIS TIME . HE HAD THEORIES OF ANCIENT EGYPT THAT I STILL CANNOT FULLY WRAP MY BRAIN AROUND . AND HE WAS ONLY 29 AT HIS DEATH . IMAGINE WHAT THAT MAN WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF HE HAD ONLY LIVED A FULL LIFE . WOW , HE WAS SO YOUNG . HIS LAST EXPLORATION WAS IN EGYPT . AND I HAVE SOME THEORIES , MYSELF , ON WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM . - [ KATE ] REALLY ? - YES . HIS GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE THOMAS GRAY WROTE THIS ARTICLE ON HIM AND HIS RESEARCH . AND THE ARTICLE REFERENCES THIS ARTIFACT THAT HARRISON FOUND IN A TOMB . - [ KATE ] WAS IT A LOCKET ? - YES . HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE LOCKET ? I HAD FOUND HARRISON 'S JOURNAL AND SOME SKETCHES OF A LOCKET UPSTAIRS . WHERE ? IN THE BEDROOM , ON THE DESK . MAY I SEE THEM , PLEASE ? - YEAH , SURE . - [ SQUEALS ] [ LAUGHING ] WELL , THAT WILL KEEP HER BUSY FOR A WHILE . DIDN 'T YOU SAY YOU NEEDED TO GO TO THE STORE FOR SOME THINGS ? YES , BUT I DON 'T WANT TO LEAVE HER HERE ALONE . OH , SHE CAN HANDLE HERSELF . SHE IS VERY RESPECTFUL OF OTHER PEOPLE 'S THINGS . ESPECIALLY HARRISON 'S . SHE 'LL BE FINE . WELL , OKAY . - HOW FAR IS IT AGAIN ? - OH , IT 'S NOT FAR . ONLY ABOUT A MILE OR SO TO THE MARINA . AUTUMN ! KATE AND I ARE GONNA RUN TO THE MARINA FOR SOME FOOD . OKAY ? OKAY . AUNTIE ELIZA , YOU SHOULD SEE IT UP HERE . IT 'S AMAZING . CAN I STAY THE NIGHT ? KATE IS NODDING HER HEAD , SO YOU ARE ONE LUCKY LADY , I SUPPOSE . THANK YOU , KATE ! YOU 'RE WELCOME , AUTUMN . IT 'LL BE NICE TO HAVE SOME COMPANY HERE ANYWAY . [ WAVES CRASHING ] FOUND ANY GOOD STUFF ? OH , MY GOODNESS , YES . I CAN 'T BELIEVE ALL THESE NOTES AND SKETCHES HAVE BEEN HIDDEN IN THIS HOUSE ALL THESE YEARS , AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO VIEW THEM UNTIL NOW . - WHERE 'S MY AUNT ? - OH , SHE SAID SHE NEEDED TO GET BACK TO SEE ABOUT HER SISTER . I TOLD HER YOU COULD BORROW SOME CLOTHES AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU MAY NEED WHILE YOU 'RE HERE . WOW , THAT 'S REALLY NICE OF YOU . I CAN 'T THANK YOU ENOUGH , KATE . NO , NO PROBLEM . IF YOU WOULD JUST SHARE THE WEALTH IF YOU FIND ANYTHING FROM HARRISON , THAT 'D BE NICE . [ LAUGHS ] FOR SURE . WELL , THIS LOCKET OF LIGHT WOULD BE WORTH A PRETTY PENNY , INDEED . SO , WHAT DOES THIS LOCKET DO , ANYWAY ? I 'M NOT TOTALLY SURE . IT 'D BE NICE IF WE COULD FIND IT . YOU HAVEN 'T COME ACROSS IT BY ANY CHANCE , HAVE YOU ? NO , NOT YET . HARRISON BELIEVED IT WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN JUST MONEY . HARRISON BELIEVED IT WOULD OPEN PORTALS TO OTHER DIMENSIONS . AND IF THAT 'S THE CASE AND WE FIND IT , I 'M PRETTY CERTAIN THAT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR THE PIONEERS IN THOSE RESEARCH FIELDS . DO YOU HAVE ANY THEORIES ABOUT THE LOCKET AND ANANDI ? YOU KNOW ABOUT ANANDI ? THE EGYPTIAN PRINCESS ? I READ SOME OF HARRISON 'S JOURNAL AND I CAUGHT ON TO SOME OF THE STORYLINE , BUT THE JARGON WAS PRETTY MUCH OVER MY HEAD . WELL , TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION , YES , I DO HAVE A THEORY . I THINK THE LOCKET , OR THE " LOCKET OF LIGHT " AS SOME WOULD LIKE TO CALL IT , SENT THE SPIRIT TO A PURGATORY-LIKE PLACE , FOR ALL ETERNITY . WHAT DID ANANDI DO THAT WOULD MAKE THEM WANT TO PUNISH HER IN THIS WAY ? THEM ? NO , NO , IT WAS HER FATHER WHO WANTED TO PUNISH HER IN THIS WAY . THE PHARAOH . HE WAS A REALLY STUBBORN LEADER . HE DEMANDED PERFECTION IN EVERYTHING , AND ANANDI FELL IN LOVE WITH A THIEF WHO RAIDED THE TOMB OF THE PHARAOH 'S MOTHER . AND BASICALLY USED ANANDI TO GET WHAT HE WANTED . AND WHEN ANANDI WOULDN 'T GIVE UP THE THIEF 'S NAME , THE PHARAOH WAS SO ANGERED BY THIS , HE LOST HIS MIND . THE TOMBS REPORT THAT THE PHARAOH WENT TO THE HEKA PRIEST FOR A FITTING PUNISHMENT . HEKA , IS BLACK MAGIC USED AGAINST THE GODS . REAL EVIL STUFF . ANYWAY , THE HIEROGLYPHICS THAT I STUDIED SHOWED THE CREATION OF THE LOCKET OF LIGHT BY THE HEKA PRIEST . AND THE PHARAOH USING IT TO SEND HIS DAUGHTER TO THE PRISON REALM FOR ALL ETERNITY . THE PHARAOH WAS DEPICTED AS GOING MAD SHORTLY AFTER , WHICH MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT HE TRULY LOVED ANANDI . BUT HE WAS JUST TOO STUBBORN TO FORGIVE HER . WELL , IF HE SENDS HER TO THIS PLACE , THIS PRISON , ISN 'T THERE A WAY HE CAN BRING HER BACK IF HE CHANGED HIS MIND ? [ SIGHS HEAVILY ] JUST BY MY RESEARCH , THE LOCKET OF LIGHT IS DEPICTED AS A DEVICE , SO I 'M THINKING MY ANSWER WOULD BE YES . ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE HIEROGLYPHICS SHOWED THAT ANANDI DIDN 'T DIE RIGHT AWAY . - WHAT ? - YEP . THE HOLY MEN THAT BURIED HER SAID THAT SHE WAS BURIED ALIVE , THAT , " HER CHEEKS WERE RED WITH LIFE . " WHOA . AND THEN HARRISON FOUND HER TOMB . YEP . AND APPARENTLY THE LOCKET , TOO . DID YOU READ THE LAST ENTRY OF HARRISON 'S JOURNAL ? NO , I HAVEN 'T . [ SIGHS ] " I WILL PERFORM EXPERIMENT 19 ON MYSELF THAT MIMICS THE PROCEDURE DEPICTED IN THE HIEROGLYPHICS FOUND IN ANANDI 'S TOMB . RESULTS TO BE DETERMINED . " - HOLY SHIT , KATE . - THAT 'S NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE LOCKET HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS DEATH , IS IT ? [ SIGHS ] NO . HE DIDN 'T HAVE THE ENDING HIEROGLYPHICS TO KNOW HOW THE LOCKET FUNCTIONS . I BET HE BELIEVED THAT THE LOCKET WOULD STAY ON HIS PHYSICAL BODY , AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET BACK THAT WAY . [ SIGHS ] I DON 'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING . BUT WE , OR ... PIONEERS IN EXPLORATION , RATHER GET CAUGHT UP IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DISCOVERY ... AND FOOLISH MISTAKES CAN BE MADE . ARE YOU SAYING THAT HARRISON ACCIDENTALLY KILLED HIMSELF , AND IS NOW STUCK IN A HELL-LIKE PRISON ? LISTEN , KATE , I 'LL KEEP LOOKING THROUGH THE NOTES AND SEE WHAT ELSE I CAN FIND . MAYBE IT 'S ALL A COINCIDENCE AND HE WAS ONE OF THOSE UNLUCKY PEOPLE THAT FELL INTO A COMA . BUT DON 'T WORRY , I 'LL FIGURE IT OUT . I 'M SORRY . HOW ABOUT SOME TEA ? EXCUSE ME ? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA ? YES , PLEASE . STILL WORKING ? YES . I 'M FINDING SOME GREAT THINGS IN HIS NOTES . HE 'S SUCH A FASCINATING MAN . I CAN ALMOST HEAR HIS VOICE THROUGH HIS WRITING . [ GIGGLES ] THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS SILLY , BUT , GOD- - I WISH I COULD HAVE KNOWN HIM . IT DOESN 'T SOUND SILLY . [ ELECTRICITY SURGING ] I FEEL LIKE I 'M INTRUDING IN ON HIS HOME . I CAN SEE HIS FACE EVERYWHERE . AND WHAT BEAUTIFUL EYES HE HAD , TOO . YOU CAN 'T REALLY TELL IN THESE BLACK AND WHITES , BUT I WONDER WHAT COLOR THEY WERE . IF I DIDN 'T KNOW ANY BETTER , I 'D SAY YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON HARRISON LLOYD . AH , WELL , I 'M AMAZED BY HIM IN ALMOST EVERY WAY . HE GAVE TO CHARITIES , AND HE DONATED HIS ARTIFACTS . HE WASN 'T ONE OF THOSE SELFISH ARCHAEOLOGISTS . HE WAS A BRILLIANT PAINTER . DID YOU SEE THE MURALS ABOVE THE GARAGE ? MY AUNT SAYS IT 'S EXTRAORDINARY . YOU 'RE A PAINTER , RIGHT ? YOU TWO HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON , THEN . I HAVEN 'T SEEN OVER THE GARAGE YET , BUT I 'LL DO THAT TOMORROW , FOR SURE . UM , AND I MADE A BED FOR YOU UPSTAIRS , BUT YOU 'RE WELCOME TO SLEEP ANYWHERE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE , AND THERE 'S SOME COMFY CLOTHES ON THE COUCH OVER THERE . THANK YOU , KATE . I FEEL AS THOUGH I HAVE KNOWN YOU FOREVER ALREADY . YEAH , ME TOO . IT 'S NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE . WELL , GOOD NIGHT THEN . GOOD NIGHT .

OH MY GOD , KATE , IT 'S REAL . THIS IS THE HOUSE THAT ENCOMPASSES WHERE HARRISON IS . I GOT ATTACKED BY ONE OF THEM . - WHAT ? - I WAS SO SCARED AND CONFUSED , I LEFT . I WENT INTO TOWN TO FIND ANSWERS , SO I CALLED MY PROFESSOR . ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? WHAT WAS IT ? I 'M OKAY . THE THING THAT ATTACKED ME , KATE , SCRATCHED MY FACE AND MY CHEST WHILE IT WAS STRANGLING ME . AND THEN IT 'S GRIP WEAKENED AND I FELL ON THE FLOOR . OH ! - [ KATE WHIMPERS ] - I 'M OKAY . I 'M ALL RIGHT . AUTUMN , WHAT HAPPENED TO ELIZA ? RIGHT . SHE HAD TO TAKE MY GRANDMOTHER TO THE HOSPITAL , SHE LEFT ME A MESSAGE WHILE I WAS IN TOWN . SO I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO CHECK IN ON THEM AND I GOT BANDAGED UP , AND I CAME STRAIGHT BACK HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT I FOUND OUT . I FEEL LIKE I 'M LOSING MY MIND , AUTUMN . IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING ? [ FLOORBOARDS CREAKING ] - OH MY GOD ! - LET 'S GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND TALK . YOU 'RE NOT CRAZY , KATE . I THOUGHT I WAS LOSING IT THERE FOR A MOMENT TOO , BUT I KNOW I DIDN 'T PUT THESE SCRATCHES ON MYSELF . WELL , WHAT DO WE DO NOW ? MY PROFESSOR CALLED ME LAST NIGHT . HE TOLD ME A STORY DEPICTED IN THE HIEROGLYPHICS THAT SHOWS A SILVER CORD THAT CONNECTS OUR SPIRITUAL BEING TO OUR PHYSICAL BODY , AND APPARENTLY THE SILVER CORD LEADS US INTO THE AFTERLIFE AFTER WE DIE . A SILVER CORD ? YES . A CONSCIOUSNESS THREAD . IT LINKS OUR SPIRITUAL BEING TO OUR PHYSICAL BODY AND OUR SPIRITUAL BEING TO THE AFTERLIFE . IT 'S ALSO KNOWN AS A LIFE THREAD BY THE EGYPTIANS . AND THE HIEROGLYPHICS SHOW THE IN-BETWEEN REALM AS A MIDWAY POINT , THAT PREVENTS THE SPIRITS FROM GOING INTO THE AFTERLIFE . SO IN LAYMAN 'S TERMS ... BASICALLY , IT 'S LIKE A PRISON THAT 'S GUARDED BY THIS MALICIOUS ENTITIES . YEAH , HARRISON SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEM . WAIT A MINUTE . DID YOU JUST SAY , " HARRISON SAID SOMETHING " ? YES . IT SOUNDS COMPLETELY NUTS . BUT I TURNED THE RADIO ON TO TRY TO COMFORT MYSELF AFTER A BAD DREAM AND I HEARD SOMEONE PRAYING . - PRAYING ? - YES . AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A LATE NIGHT RADIO ANNOUNCER . SO I STARTED PRAYING ALONG WITH HIM . IT ENDED UP BEING HARRISON AND HE COULD HEAR ME , AND WE COULD SOMEHOW COMMUNICATE THROUGH THE RADIO . FASCINATING ! THIS IS AMAZING STUFF , KATE ! GROUNDBREAKING FOR MY RESEARCH . NOT TO MENTION , I 'M CRAZY JEALOUS YOU GOT TO SPEAK TO HARRISON LLOYD . [ LAUGHS ] I 'M JUST GLAD YOU DON 'T THINK I 'M CRAZY . LOOK AT THIS BANDAGE , KATE . I KNOW YOU 'RE NOT CRAZY . THANK YOU , AUTUMN . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF YOU WEREN 'T HERE . - OKAY . - OKAY , LET 'S GET BACK TO WHAT I FOUND OUT . MY PROFESSOR HAS A THEORY ABOUT WATER . - WATER ? - YES . THIS DIAGRAM IS THE ONLY ONE MY PROFESSOR FOUND THAT SHOWS A GLIMPSE OF THE REALM WHERE HARRISON IS . THIS DIAGRAM WAS BURIED WITH A HEKA PRIEST . THIS IS THE PATH TO THE REALM OF THE GODS . THIS MIDDLE ONE IS WHERE HARRISON IS . MY PROFESSOR BELIEVED THESE TO BE DOORS , OR GATES . THIS TEXT TRANSLATES INTO THIS . " FOR THE WORTHY FEW , THE DOORS OF HEAVEN OPEN BY THE WATER FOR THEE . THE DOORS OF THE COOL PLACE OPEN TO THE LIGHT . THOU SHALL FIND THE WATER OF LIFE . DRINK AS A GOD AMONG THE ETERNALS ON THE IMPERISHABLE STAR . " DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ? OH ! THERE 'S MORE . OKAY . OKAY . MM , THE OLD TESTAMENT , MY PROFESSOR FOUND THE BOOK OF ECCLESIASTES , 12 : 6-7 . " IF THE SILVER CORD BE LOST , FOLLOW THE LIGHT TO THE CISTERN AND DRINK THE WATERS OF THE AFTERLIFE . THEN SHALL THE DUST RETURN TO THE EARTH AS IT WAS . AND THE SPARED SHALL RETURN ONTO GOD WHO GAVE IT . " LIGHT ! HARRISON SAID HE COULD SEE A LIGHT . THAT 'S THE WAY OUT , THAT 'S HOW HE CAN ESCAPE . WE HAVE TO TELL HARRISON . [ RADIO CRACKLING ] IT 'S WORTH A TRY I GUESS . HARRISON ? CAN YOU HEAR ME ? HARRISON ? HARRISON ? WE DON 'T HAVE MUCH TIME , KATE . THE RADIO IS NO USE . MY PROFESSOR SUGGESTED CONTACTING HARRISON IN A DIFFERENT WAY . HOW ? WE CAUSE A DIVERSION . A DIVERSION ? WHAT KIND OF DIVERSION ? WITH YOU , KATE . WITH ME ? I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY . BUT MY PROFESSOR STUDIED THOUSANDS OF HIEROGLYPHICS AND HE SAYS THE LOCKET OF LIGHT CAN BRING A SOUL BACK INTO ITS BODY IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT , AUTUMN ? I 'M TALKING ABOUT YOU GOING TO THE IN-BETWEEN REALM TO CAUSE A DIVERSION TO HELP HARRISON ESCAPE . THAT IS TOTALLY INSANE . YOU WANT ME TO GO TO A HELL LIKE PLACE ON A HUNCH AND A THEORY BY YOUR PROFESSOR ? HAVE YOU FUCKING LOST YOUR MIND ? KATE . HAVE YOU EVER LOST SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU ? AND IF YOU COULD GO BACK AND CHANGE THE PAST , WOULD YOU ? WOULD YOU SAVE HIM ? I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS , KATE . YOU REALLY THINK SO ? COME ON , KATE . THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME THRILL RIDE ! YOU CAN SAVE HIM ! OKAY . I 'LL DO IT . [ LAUGHS ] YOU 'RE THE BRAVEST WOMAN I KNOW ! AND YOU SAY YOU CAN BRING ME BACK ? ACCORDING TO HARRISON 'S NOTES AND MY PROFESSOR 'S THEORY , YES . I CAN BRING YOU BACK . WELL , WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR ? HARRISON TOLD ME WHERE IT MAY BE . THEN LEAD THE WAY ! HE SAID IT MAY HAVE FELL OFF BY A WINDOW . [ RUSTLING ] [ KATE ] AUTUMN ? OH , KATE . IT 'S BEAUTIFUL . I KNOW WHAT TO DO . FOLLOW ME . THIS IS WHAT ACTIVATES IT . AND THEN THE LEGS WRAP AROUND LIKE THIS , AND- - WILL IT BE PAINFUL ? I 'M NOT SURE . I HOPE NOT . HOW WILL I GET BACK ? THIS IS THE OTHER LEVER THAT WILL BRING YOUR SPIRIT BACK INTO YOUR BODY . WELL , THE DEPICTIONS ON THE TOMB SHOW THE HEKA PRIEST PERFORMING THIS . AND ACCORDING TO THAT WE HAVE 24 HOURS UNTIL THE SILVER CORD , OR LIFE THREAD , WILL BE SEVERED FROM YOUR PHYSICAL BODY . I CANNOT BELIEVE I 'M ACTUALLY GONNA DO THIS . HOW DO YOU KNOW 24 HOURS ? JUST TRUST ME , KATE . YOU 'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT . IF YOU 'RE GONNA DO THIS , JUST TRUST ME . I WILL SET THE CLOCK FOR 23 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES , AND THEN I WILL HIT THE BUTTON AND PULL YOU BACK . AND HOW WILL I KNOW IF HARRISON GETS TO THE LIGHT AND DRINKS THE WATER ? IT WILL BE A BRIGHT FLASH OF LIGHT . UNMISTAKABLE . AND THEN I JUST WAIT FOR YOU TO BRING ME BACK ? JUST GET IN AND HELP HARRISON FIND THE DOOR BY THE DARK WATER . AND REMEMBER TO TELL HIM TO GO THROUGH THE DOOR AND FIND THE FOUNTAIN AND DRINK FROM IT . AND I WILL DO THE REST . WHY DON 'T YOU DO IT , AUTUMN ? YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS STUFF THAN I DO . AND I 'M GONNA GET IN THERE AND I 'M GONNA PANIC AND I 'M GONNA FORGET WHAT I 'M SUPPOSED TO DO . KATE , YOU 'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT . AND I 'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET YOU BACK SAFELY . WOULDN 'T YOU WANT SOMEONE TO SAVE YOU FROM A PLACE LIKE THAT ? WHEN DO WE DO THIS ? - NOW . - NOW ? WHY NOW ? WE CAN 'T LET HARRISON BE IN A PLACE LIKE THAT FOR ANOTHER MINUTE . COME SIT ON THE SOFA , PLEASE . [ SIGHS ] I CAN 'T BELIEVE I JUST MET YOU , AND NOW I 'M TRUSTING YOU WITH MY ETERNAL SOUL . I WON 'T LET YOU DOWN , KATE . YOU JUST FOCUS ON HARRISON . DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO SAVE HIM . [ METALLIC BUZZING ] ARE YOU READY ? [ SIGHS ] GOOD LUCK . [ GROANS ] [ FAINT MANIACAL LAUGHTER ] [ FAINT LAUGHTER CONTINUES ] [ SCRATCHING ] MANIACAL LAUGHTER ] [ SNARLING ] [ LAUGHS ] [ SLURPING ] [ LAUGHS ] [ GROWLS ] [ SNARLING ] [ GROWLS ] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE , KATE ? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND ? DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE ? I CAME HERE TO SAVE YOU . THAT 'S THE THING . YOU CANNOT SAVE ME . NOW YOU 'VE CONDEMNED YOURSELF . THE DOOR . YOU MUST GET TO THE DOOR BY THE LAKE . THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE LIGHT . THERE 'S NO WAY , THAT DOOR 'S GUARDED BY THEM , ALWAYS . HOW SAFE ARE WE IN THIS CLOSET ? WE 'RE NOT . WE NEED TO MOVE IN A FEW MINUTES . THEY DON 'T KNOW YOU 'RE HERE YET , BUT IT WON 'T TAKE THEM LONG TO FIGURE IT OUT . WHAT WILL THEY DO IF THEY FIND ME HERE ? IT 'LL BE LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING FOR THEM . THEY WILL TEAR YOU APART . AND JACKHAMMER , THE ONE YOU JUST WITNESSED CARVING THAT WOMAN 'S FACE OFF , WILL CUT HOLES ALL OVER YOUR BODY FOR FUN JUST BECAUSE HE THINKS IT LOOKS PRETTY . WHO WAS THAT WOMAN , IS SHE DEAD ? SHE 'S A LOST SOUL , LIKE ME . NOW YOU . WE ARE IMMORTAL IN THIS PLACE , BUT WE FEEL PAIN AND AGONY . OUR BODIES ARE REGENERATIVE SO WE CAN BE TORN APART AGAIN , AND AGAIN . LOOK , WE DON 'T HAVE TIME . THE PLAN IS THAT I WILL DISTRACT THEM ... LISTEN , AND YOU 'LL HAVE A BRIEF MOMENT TO MAKE IT TO THE DOOR , FIND THE LIGHT , DRINK FROM THE WATER , AND GO ON YOUR WAY . THAT 'S YOUR PLAN , KATE ? THERE 'S SEVEN OF THEM . YES , AND YOU SAID WHEN THEY FIND ME , THEY 'LL WANT TO TAKE TURNS PLAYING WITH THEIR NEW TOY , RIGHT ? SHH . [ GROWLING ] [ GROANING ] - [ MAN SCREAMS ] - [ WOMAN LAUGHS ] [ BLUDGEONING ] [ MAN SCREAMING ] [ GROWLS ] [ PANTING ] I BELIEVE YOU 'VE MET THE COUNTESS . WHY DO I SMELL SULFUR ? IT 'S THEM . AND I 'M SO THIRSTY . YES . AND IT GETS WORSE WITH TIME . AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT CAN 'T GET ANY WORSE , IT STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN . HOW HAVE YOU NOT LOST YOUR MIND ? I DON 'T KNOW . BECAUSE I 'VE NEVER TOTALLY LOST HOPE . I DON 'T KNOW HOW I 'M GONNA MAKE IT 24 HOURS . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , 24 HOURS ? AUTUMN SAYS SHE 'LL BRING ME BACK IN 24 HOURS . KATE , TIME 'S NOT LINEAR HERE . WE NEED TO EXERT IF WE 'RE GONNA GIVE THIS PLAN OF YOURS A GO . [ PANTING ] I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE YOU 'RE HERE , RISKING YOUR LIFE FOR ME .

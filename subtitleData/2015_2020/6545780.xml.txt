 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Daisy : A team centered around people with powers ? Seems I might just get my team after all . Malick : Thousands of years ago , an Inhuman was born on this planet that was destined to rule it , That others were consumed with dread , and so they banished it from the Earth . Hydra was founded with the sole purpose of engineering its return . Simmons : He saved my life , and I never would have survived without him . Fitz : Do you love him ? - Simmons : Yes . - I can 't hate him . Why else would you fall for him ? He did everything right . [ Voice breaking ] And you dove through a hole in the universe for me ! [ Gasps ] You 're not Will . Will died saving Jemma ... from me . [ Grunting ] [ Glass shatters quietly , whoosh ] Ward : Now you know how it feels , Coulson ... to watch someone you care for bleed out right in front of you . Coulson : And now I 'm coming to put you down . [ Bones crack ] It 's over , Ward . Malick was right . This is all meant to be . I am part of a grand plan . _ [ Alarm blaring ] [ Siren walls in distance ] _ _ [ Tires screech ] _ _ _ [ Crashing , banging ] _ _ _ [ Gunshot ] _ This can 't be easy . It 's fine . Can I ask , why here ? I want him to see where it happened . Besides , I wasn 't about to give him the location of our base . And apparently , he didn 't want to invite us to his house . Man : All clear . - Mr. President . - Director Coulson . Thank you for meeting me . Long overdue . Rosalind spoke highly of you . She believed that I should be working with S.H.I.E.L.D. I did always value her judgment . I 'll miss her . I assume we 're not here to share memories of a fallen friend . This ... this problem ... Rosalind said you called them Inhumans ? Heads of state calling , not sure what 's happening . Watchdog agencies hurling accusations . Fox News won 't shut up . I don 't need to tell you how delicate the situation is , but we have to do something . With all due respect , Mr. President , we are doing something . _ _ _ _ You 're doing good . I 'm not great at projecting authority . It 's nice to talk Spanish , though . Reminds me of home . Do you miss it ? Especially Sundays . Mom cooks on Sundays . [ Chuckles ] And you ? You have people ? Sort of . Not really . Colonel Ramon . I speak English , if it makes this easier . It does . Thank you . This way to my office . We 're following up a report . Your officers were attacked by a powered assailant ? Yes . We 're already overwhelmed by the guns , drugs , and kidnappings , and now these things . Are they really aliens ? It 's a little bit more complicated than that . But like everyone else , there are good ones and bad ones . But when they are bad , we are powerless to stop them . That convoy was loaded with weapons that were supposed to help us fight whatever this is . And now weapons are gone . But we 're here . We 've got a team on the ground , and we 're here to help . I don 't know how it is that your agency still exists , nor do I want to know , but I appreciate your help . Does that mean you 're reauthorizing S.H.I.E.L.D. ? The public has a short memory but not that short . The image of Helicarriers crashing down on the nation 's capital is hard to forget . Then why is this meeting happening if S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn 't exist ? Because I need you to keep doing what you 're doing . Privately . Publicly , the ATCU will still be the face of my administration 's response to advanced threats . I 'll appoint a new head to the agency , one who understands they answer to you . So we 're your black-ops response . Isn 't black ops where you feel most comfortable ? I certainly prefer it to bureaucracy . Okay , then . We 'll keep doing what we do , and you 'll keep pretending we don 't exist . Exactly . - One last thing . - Mm-hmm . Gideon Malick . I can 't help you . He ordered this hit . He 's Hydra . Even if you can prove any of that , Gideon Malick has a stake in almost every country 's economy . He advises world leaders , he served on the World Council , he spent a lifetime and a fortune building influence . I can 't pull that thread . But you can let him walk free ? Rosalind bled to death right here . Malick may have blood on his hands ... but my hands are tied . Yours are not . Is there any intel you 're willing to give ? Never spent enough time with the man to get in his head . Listen , I 'm aware of your sacrifices . I thank you for your service . I 'll be in touch when I 've named a new head to the ATCU . [ Door opens , closes ] Sorry he didn 't give you an angle to go at Malick . Actually , he may have . I 've seen this before . Protests in Beirut . Hunter : Urban rioting 101 . Child 's play compared to the real issue - Powers , wrong hands , again . This could be something . An entire armory 's worth of military might nicked from a police van , right under the nose of the police in less than four minutes . The two of us , trained , experienced ... We can pull this off . But all it takes is one tainted fish taco , and pff . Unfair advantage , really . Transmission starting now . No offense intended . Yeah , no , it 's great , being hunted , feared . It 's a blast . Metal scraping on an urban street ... A million and one possibilities . Fitz ? I hate to bother you , but is there something I 'm not seeing ? [ Device turns off ] No . You 're right . It 's , um ... inconclusive . Copy that . So , as far as the police on the scene believe , whoever attacked them was invisible . Well , we 've seen weirder . Invisibility ... Imagine the possibilities . What are you imagining ? Nothing fun . Get used to it . We can 't put the Terrigen genie back in the bottle . Powers are the new normal . I think you 're just jealous . Damn right I am . Tell me you didn 't try one of those little fish-oil pills . I had my fingers crossed for x-ray vision . I was just curious . I wasn 't the only one . I mean , I-I thought about it . I didn 't actually do it . Rehab was a bitch . Man , you two deserve each other . Let 's fan out , cover more ground . Pretty nifty magic trick you did there . Manos . Arriba . You 'd think three years high school Spanish ... All right , all right . Don 't do anything stupid . We 're just here to ... [ Grunts ] [ Conversing in Spanish ] [ Wood creaks ] How do you lose someone as big as Mack ? I don 't know . Same way one loses a truckload of weapons . Well , good thing a grocery store down the street is security-conscious . [ Sighs ] Here we go . Who 's he looking at ? [ Keyboard clacking ] W-what did we just watch ? [ Keyboard clacking ] How accelerated , exactly ? Approximately 6 meters in a thirtieth of a second that one frame of video is exposed . So , very . Well , catching her won 't be easy . I 'll reconfigure the containment module , - if we can even get her in there . - Thanks . So , you do that remotely ? Exactly . The poly-tectic material then adapts to the powers we 're dealing with . A necessity since Inhuman powers are so random . Not true . I 'm sorry ? Powers aren 't random . We were taught that each is given to fill an evolutionary need at the time . Are you being serious ? To create equilibrium within the species . Yin yang and all that . At least , that 's what we were taught . Huh . An actual intelligent design . [ Light buzzing ] Oh . Uh , sir , I think you 're gonna be pretty ... Stop what you 're doing . Come with me . What do you think of Mr. Campbell ? Lincoln ? Smart . Obviously most helpful in helping us ... Jemma ... Understand Inhuman biology . And it 's been good for keeping her busy , focusing on something else . Things still feel different , though . But how could they not after what I did to Will ? You did what you had to do . We both did . Sometimes there 's no choice but the hard choice . That 's the job . Now set up the machine . - Sir , you 're not really think ... - It 's not for me . There 's one person who might have information about Gideon Malick . I need to get into his head . _ _ _ _ _ _ Been waiting for you to come back . Ah . So you snap back to the same spot like a yoyo . Good to know . How about you let me ... Aah ! Damn it ! I 'm starting to hate you . No mas . Von Strucker 's in a persistent vegetative state . Significant portions of his brain are damaged . Sir , I 'm not sure what you want to do is even possible . Let 's find out . It 's worth a shot if it gets us closer to Malick . We were alerted to a police report ... Bogota , Colombia . I 've dispatched a team . We need to replace our losses . Dr. Garner did a lot of damage , and our guest needs Inhumans . You have doubts . He can barely stand , doesn 't speak . Because he spent hundreds of years clinging to life , trying to survive on the few men we were able to sacrifice every few decades . But I 'm not a fool . Keep your eyes open . I don 't want my faith to be misplaced . [ Elevator bell dings ] Sir , he 's asking for you . He spoke ? [ Door closes ] How can I help you ? What do you need ? I 'm hungry . Chair 's an upgrade . At least there 's that . _ Yeah , again , I don 't know what you 're saying . _ _ Policia ? Yeah . You stole pistolas from the policia and sold the pistolas to your amigos ... criminals . _ _ Yeah , you ... Whoosh , whoosh . You 're a criminal . _ _ _ Dios ? You think God did this ? SÃ­ . Dios . You think it was a gift from Dios or pescado ? Pescado ? Yeah , fish . I know my way around a menu . [ Speaking Spanish ] _ _ _ I think you 're talking about Terrigenesis . - Terrigenesis ? - Yeah . You 're an alien . My partner 's one , too . [ Rumbling ] You 'll see her soon enough . [ Sighs ] Thank God . Hey , you . Her ? Don 't make me crush you . So , this recovers lost memories ? But it 's a dangerous procedure on a healthy subject . And Werner 's anything but . Anoxic brain trauma . Prefrontal cortex is barely active . But memories are backed up in other areas , as well , traces and images tucked throughout the brain . Just need to dig them out . You have a problem with this ? Because I do . I 've been in this thing twice . Getting my arm cut off was pleasant by comparison . But they 're telling me Gideon Malick is untouchable . I won 't accept that . - We good to go ? - Yes , sir . [ Machine humming ] Werner , I need your help . Concentrate on Gideon Malick . Just kill me . Just kill me . Just kill me . Just kill me . Just kill me ! Just kill me ! No , just kill me ! - [ Monitors beeping rapidly ] - Just kill me ! Daisy : She 'll wake up soon , and when she does , I want you to run point on intake . What do we know about her ? Other than the kidnapping and the gun-running . She works a clerical job at a museum . At night , art classes . Artist turned gun-runner . Kind of sexy . No record . It doesn 't add up . She got powers . That 's how it adds up . Andrew was a lovely head shrinker before he turned into a not-so-lovely Inhuman serial killer . Point made . Fair enough . Mack , is this the accomplice that you mentioned ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's him . Her cousin . Lives by her . Also no record . Why are they taking those weapons ? Hunter and I will go track them down . [ Air whooshing ] You 're up . [ Speaking Spanish ] She 's feisty . Yeah , she 's not happy to be locked in there . I guess the shoe 's on the other foot . You 're enjoying this . Mm . Maybe a little . You trying to regain strength ? You were hurt pretty bad . The body was dead . I was dying . They have advanced , but they haven 't changed . " They " ? Humans . But you 're not human anymore , are you ? You don 't believe I am what they say . Once I 'm strong enough you will . Werner : Just kill me ! Just kill me ! Just kill me ! Just kill me ! - Just kill me ! - This isn 't working . He 's stuck in a memory of trauma . We can 't snap him out of it . - Just kill me ! - I know what that 's like . Just kill me ! Just kill me ! What about him ? - Me ? - Just kill me . Neurons communicate using electrical impulses . Just kill me . You could stimulate other areas of his brain . - Targeted electroshock . - Just kill me . - Hell no . I 'm not doing that . - Just kill me . Well , at the very least , it could jolt him out of this loop . - Or fry his cerebrum . - Just kill me . He 's suffering . - You could help snap him out of it . - Just kill me . Just kill me . Just kill me . Just kill me . Just kill me . Just kill me . [ Gasps ] [ Monitors beeping ] Simmons : It 's working . [ Breathing shakily ] Coulson : Tell me about Gideon Malick . I 'll handle everything . He sold me out . You sold me out . Before he sold you out , you reached him . - How ? - You sold me out ! Tell me how . Dad said only as a last resort . Perizad sent me . We went to Princeton together . No . I was afraid . I didn 't have anywhere else to turn . I didn 't know where else to turn . And now we do . _ _ _ _ _ Tell her S.H.I.E.L.D. isn 't really with anyone . We 're sort of our own thing . [ Speaking Spanish ] She said her powers were a gift from God . _ _ _ I think we were wrong about her . Ask her about the convoy . Why 'd she take those weapons ? _ _ [ Tires screech ] _ _ But ... they belong to the police . _ Thieves in uniform . _ _ _ _ [ Cellphone rings ] Found him . He was dumping weapons into the river . She 's telling the truth . We got visitors . Local law enforcement . Okay , well , be careful . Not everyone 's on this side of the law . We 're on our way . Stay with him ? What 's going on here ? We 've got this . World Health Organization jurisdiction . You don 't really expect me to just drive away , do you ? Guess not . It would 've been easier if you had . [ Inhales sharply ] [ Grunts ] _ _ _ _ Hunter and Bobbi were gone by the time we got there . Elena 's cousin . The police just left him there . [ Sighs ] I need to tell Coulson what 's going on . I haven 't seen a lot of dead bodies , but is that normal ? No , it 's too soon for rigor mortis to set in , but ... maybe they have another kind of weapon . An Inhuman ? I don 't see how Bobbi and Hunter were taken otherwise . Elena has been asking about him . [ Keypad beeps ] I 'm sorry . [ Breathing shakily ] Hunter ? Are you okay ? It hurts . Yeah . Pain means it 's wearing off . Ugh . Bloody powers . [ Door opens ] Good afternoon , beautiful . Colonel Ramon : I need you to answer questions . His fate depends on your answers . Why are you really here ? Uh , Joey 's here to , um ... Here 's the thing . It 's not something I talk about , but like you , I rely on my faith . [ Translating in Spanish ] And somehow , I never made the connection till you said it , but ... maybe these powers , these ... gifts that you have , that Daisy has , maybe they 're not random . Maybe it 's part of a plan . _ She believes she 's meant to do good with these gifts . We believe the same thing . We need to help each other , to stop them . She 's in . How do your powers work ? It 's connected to her pulse . And what does that mean ? What 's the radius on her powers ? As far as she can go in one heartbeat . [ Heart beating ] [ Gasps ] You 're my new best friend . Okay . Here . Two figures , not moving but alive . Assuming Bobbi and Hunter . The other figures moving in the room ... assume bad guys . One of them has powers , so best we avoid him . To that end ... At S.H.I.E.L.D. , we do better than duct tape . [ Cuff beeps ] Joey , you seeing this ? Mm-hmm . Take care of it . Colonel Ramon : Why did you even come here ? We 're part of an alien task force . There 's an invasion happening of powered people , like ... Medusa eyes over there . [ Rumbling ] [ Alarm blares ] Like I said , alien invasion . [ Blaring continues ] [ Blaring continues ] [ Blaring continues ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Okay , you grab the weapons , and I 'll ... Or you do that . Maybe you should make a run for it . [ Blaring continues ] [ Gasps ] Mack , you need to warn the others . Mack : The Inhuman ... The power 's in his eyes ! No , no , Elena , don 't ! [ Cuff beeps ] His glasses . [ Groans ] Elena ! [ Door closes ] Perizad sent me . We went to Princeton together . [ Metal detector hums ] [ Metal detector beeps ] [ Prosthetic hand beeps ] [ Ringing ] Man : Hold , please . [ Elevator music plays ] Werner ? No , he 's in no shape to make phone calls these days . You made sure of that , if I 'm talking to Gideon Malick . I 'll take that as a yes . Phil Coulson here . [ Laughs ] Is this about Rosalind Price ? The man who took her is gone . As will be everything you value . It 's started to unravel , hasn 't it ? Your portal gone , the Inhumans you stockpiled murdered ... It wasn 't easy to get this number , but this call will cost you . We 're tracking this line everywhere it connects . It 'll cost me millions , to be sure . I 'll have to shut down a few offices , but ... don 't get too far ahead of yourself , Mr. Coulson . My influence reaches a little bit farther than that . [ Dial tone ] We 'll configure the module to hold him , and get Bobbi , Elena , and Hunter to medical . [ Explosion ] [ Rumbling ] Joey : What is that ? Hydra . - No . No , no , no . - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ She 's not wrong . _ _ _ _ She 's a perfect fit for this team you 're trying to build . Except for the pesky little fact she doesn 't want any part of it . Look , she 's also vulnerable out there . Might be a good thing , keeping her close . It 's safer . Don 't look at me like that . Is it safer ? Four of us in one place makes us vulnerable , like the 12 Inhumans Lash killed . It 's hard to build a team if everyone 's spread over the world . When I was a hacker , my team and I , we were tight , and we weren 't on the same continent . Huh . Yeah , with the right tech solution , it could work . Let 's hope the Director agrees . [ Watch beeps ] If we need backup , or if you do , we 're a tap away . Backup . I 'm ... I 'm sorry for kidnapping you . I 'll see you soon ... Yo-Yo . Goodbye , Mack . Goodbye . How about you ? Maybe you don 't have to miss dinner this Sunday . [ Keyboard clacking ] When did you get done ? Uh , earlier today . I think he 's gonna like this one . How are you ? Must be fascinating getting to know all about Inhuman DNA and ... I miss you . There it is . I miss you . I 'm here . Together . We 're ... Professional and matter of fact , and there 's this chasm in the middle of the room of all these things , of our kiss and Will 's death , and ... And I 'm sorry about that , Jemma , because ... Because maybe there was another way ... and there was something else that I could 've done . Will died saving me . What you did was kill a thing , a monster . You 've been nothing less than extraordinary this whole time . So , um about this ... chasm , as you call it . Can we start over , back to where we began ? 16 and achingly shy . Two people , endlessly inquisitive , about to embark on a relationship that will change their lives , but they don 't know where it will go . I 'm Jemma Simmons , biochemist . Leopold Fitz , engineering . Hey , you . Welcome back . So , I just ran into Joey , packing up . Yeah . You think I 'm making a mistake ? Letting him live a normal life like everyone else ? No , you 're not . No , I mean offering you the same deal . Your APB 's been lifted . No one 's looking for you . You could go back to your old life if you want . I don 't know . It 's pretty interesting here . I was hoping you 'd say that . You 're trusting them more . It 's good to delegate . So it 's not because you don 't trust yourself . It looks good . Fitz outdid himself on this one . Lots of bells and whistles . It 's pretty fantastic . May I ? [ Chuckles ] Feels real . Feels like the others . It 's not the hand . It 's me . Maybe you 're not supposed to get over it . Some things you can 't move past . They scar you , change you permanently . I don 't know what happened there , on that planet . I do . You joined the cavalry . [ Tablet beeps ] Man : In a surprising move , Gothite Industry closed 10 offices today . Their stock prices continue to tumble as investor react . Gideon Malick could not be reached for comment . Sometimes you 're wounded , sometimes you wound . But he 's still collecting Inhumans . Any theories as to why ? Lincoln said Inhuman powers create a balance for the species , an equilibrium . We got a lot of heroes on our side . Makes me wonder what Malick has on his . Malick : Did we get the Inhuman ? The doctors are with him now , but they say his powers are strong . At least we get some good news today . You want to believe , but you don 't know if you can . Coulson survived . Could be you 're not who I thought you were . You 'll believe ... once I make a believer out of him . It makes perfect sense to name him the head of the ATCU . He knows all the players , the public respects military authority ... You 've worked together . I wouldn 't exactly call it " together . " He has the utmost respect for you . Now I know you 're lying . Remember , he 'll be taking orders from you . And I 'm sure he 's thrilled about that . I 'm confident this will work out , Coulson . - Mr. President . - [ Monitor beeps ] [ Breathes deeply ] Oh , boy .

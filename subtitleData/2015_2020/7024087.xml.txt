 Previously on Stitchers ... I need to appoint someone to take all my responsibilities . Please tell me I didn 't lose a potentially career-changing promotion just so you could date the new brunette ? We are not okay . you 're handling this stitch ? He 's got the yips . He 's worried about you . so that after stitching technology is perfected we can stitch into her living evolved brain and map it completely . - Good talk . - Hmm . Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she 's seeing in the stitch . Things are heating up . the more it 's going to mess with your ability to stitch . We have to do this if we 're gonna save my mother . I know . I 'm with you . - How are those oxytocin levels ? - Holding steady . Yours ? Never lower . You 're doing it all wrong . - What ? - The walk of shame . There 's no walk . There 's no shame . I give you and Cameron a lot of credit for holding out as long as you did before finally throwing oxytocin to the wind in favor of the other big " O. and a cuddle . We 're keeping things very PG around here . - And your night ? - Unh . Hard " R. Cameron 's really able to keep his hands off you ? He 's got incredible willpower . He 's fine . 98 . 100 . how long you gonna keep this up for ? As long as it takes for you to work up a damn oxytocin filter . - Feet . - Look at the bright side . Look how much money you 're gonna save on your gas bills with all those cold showers you take . cold showers aren 't a thing . I have . What I don 't have is a functioning oxytocin filter . - Can we talk about your yips for a moment ? - No . you 're freaked out about Kirsten . - Not talking about it . - And you 're afraid of her getting hurt . And that fear has manifested itself into yips . - Still not talking about it . - I 'm just saying . I agree with you . You should let Camille pilot stitches for a while . - I 'm a good listener if you ever need one . - No . but I 'm good . you do the filter . boss . So define " a cuddle . " Was there spooning ? can I interest you in a little trouble ? Go on . right ? Go on ! right ? And now that Cameron has me piloting the stitches ... Then we can spend a little more time in the regions that we need to map . we do . I hacked into the lab 's mind map system . mapping the brain . Pulsing sections are everything we 've already treaded . And the static areas are regions that we haven 't fully mapped yet . They 'll be our focus moving forward . you want me to go behind the back of and flip a hearty bird the National Security Agency ? - Absolutely . - It 's about damn time . - Cameron doesn 't know you want to do this ? - No . And he can 't find out . and lingering anywhere long enough to map it would just completely freak him out . you don 't go to your boss when you want to break protocol . You come to someone like me . Now what we need is a body . mid-to-late 30s . Shot once in the chest before being thrown or falling off the roof of the Windwood Hotel . Tattoo on his right forearm is running through image recognition now . Killer also shot off his left index finger . we 're out of baby carrots . Finger 's missing . terracotta shards were in the wound . So we dug out the bullet from a tile in the roof where we know his hand was held down . We 're running ballistics on it now . Why shoot off his finger ? Maybe the killer was trying to make a point . No pun intended . Maybe I should pilot this . No . You might still have a little performance anxiety . She means in a stitch kind of way . Of course . It 's the only frame of reference I have on you . You can try naming all the state capitals . - I hear that helps . - I don 't have performance ... anx ... Whatever . You can pilot . Here 's my map . This must be what Beyonce feels like when she drops a secret album . watch out for Linus . He 'll be the first one to notice something 's up . you could always think of the starting lineup for the ' 69 Mets . aren 't you ? I am . please . no-go for stitch neurosync . Life-Sci ? Go . - Sub-Bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . You can also think of all the different kinds of pickles . Works for me . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . one-two . - Let 's get into trouble . All right . Obligatory movie quote ? - " I see dead people . " - Too easy . Induce stitch neurosync on my mark . one ... mark . This is odd . Describe " odd . but it 's deserted . No people . - And I 'm sensing something . - What ? What are you sensing ? I 'm sensing that it 's not a real art gallery . I can 't explain it . John Doe isn 't here . do you need to bounce ? No . I must be here for a reason . Let 's stick around a while . where is she ? Part of the brain responsible for symbols and imagery . It 's an area we haven 't mapped fully . - Might explain what she 's feeling . - Move her somewhere else . let her poke around . - Camille . my rules . my orders . Mission clock 's running . Got a memory hotspot in another region that 's mapped a little better . - Move her . - Linus ... thanks . Did I make a mistake trusting you ? pressure 's on to move . I see something . but on a display stand . Just got a hit on John Doe 's tattoo . British Royal Marines . He 's a sailor ? Apparently who plays with dolls . There are weird things . There 's a swan and a sword . And a patch of grass . An apple tree . around a golden snake . Any of you geniuses know what any of this means ? I don 't speak bizarro . There 's a tile on another pedestal . A cow standing on it . And there 's another golden snake wrapped around the cow . Like a hug . three tequilas . John Doe encrypted his memories . This is image-based encoding . Move her to the language processing cortex . I kinda feel like there 's more to explore here . Mission clock at two minutes and forty-three seconds . There 's no time . John Doe created an image-based language for himself . We need to be in the language processing cortex . I just think ... - I don 't care what you think . please . - Death moment approaching . - Playtime 's over . Death moment is upon us . You okay ? - I 'm fine . - What were you two playing at ? - Nothing . - Reckless or stupid ? Goodkin . so are you reckless or stupid ? that depends . Are you the lab director or a flustered boyfriend ? I 'm the guy who 's wondering if he was wrong for trusting you . let 's just dial the temperature down here . to beef up mind mapping in areas we 're weakest in . It 'll prepare us better to stitch into my mother . Did you at least see who killed John Doe ? whatever that means . I 'll tell you what it means . a memory technique for people who need to keep their secrets secret . - Royal Marines plus mind palace equals ... - John Doe was a spy . More gold . More like gold-gold . - That 's it . - And save and swipe . - Cow . Snake . - Cowsnake . Here it is . A harmless snake encouraged by farmers to live in barns . John Doe 's snake was far from harmless . - What about the soldiers ? - There were four of them . Marching . where you going ? - Rogue . I 'm going rogue . A concept you 're familiar with . I 'll follow up with Fisher on ballistics . see if there 's anything there that ties into the images . a field trip . I 'll go with you . I could apologize again if it would make you happy . you know I 've accepted but then you go behind my back and make this secret plan for the stitch with Camille instead of coming to me ? You would have said no . did you not understand ? Is this what it is to care about someone ? That you 're worried about them all the time ? that just doesn 't sound right to me . I have a history of watching people I care about get into bad situations or worse . Well ... - Then maybe we shouldn 't be together . - This isn 't was this is about . then I don 't want anything to do with this . You are not the only one who gets to worry about how the other person is doing . Fine . I 'll work on not being such a helicopter boyfriend . That 's the last time you go rogue . not without me . Okay . You got it . I 'll be Rogue One and you can be Rogue Two . there will never be a Rogue Two . I 'll tell you the same thing I told you over the phone . MI6 has nothing to tell the NSA . none of your people are in Los Angeles right now ? - I didn 't say that . - A man was murdered at the Windwood Hotel . We think he 's one of yours . - Do you have a name ? - No . There was no identification on him . there 's no connection between your John Doe and MI6 . He has a Royal Marines tattoo . And we have reason to believe he was familiar with spycraft . I honor and respect his memory ... but that still doesn 't make him MI6 . What I don 't respect is the NSA . but never offering any in return . I 've dealt with your organization in the past . Don 't care for it . And see no reason to do it again . hmm ? You want cooperation ? I 'm willing to offer it . Consider it a professional courtesy . What ... do you want ? you don 't have the authority to grant . Try me . Help me help you . Why are you quoting Jerry Maguire ? He does that . So ... what do you want ? Her name 's Chloe Marks . LAPD picked her up last night on a drunk and disorderly . not stirred ? any chance Stephanie can pull some strings at the DA 's office ? Agent Stick-Up-His-Ass helps us with our John Doe . Why doesn 't he go through official channels ? I dunno . Didn 't want to embarrass the agency . Uh-huh . but no promises . Okay . huh ? What happened to " professional courtesy " ? Huh . You should hear what I really wanted to call him . not get them out . - Why the sudden interest in Chloe Marks ? - It 's a quid pro quo . If Chloe 's the " quid " who 's the " quo " ? I get it . - She punched a cop . - She 's a foreign national . Tell that to the cop 's busted nose . Well ... Are you really going to make me do this without going through the proper channels ? We both know no one can make Stephanie Fisher do anything she doesn 't want to do . I 'll file the paperwork . Thank you . I owe you . Dinner ? my friend . I can work with that . She 's so ... - Young . - Pretty . Chloe Marks . Which one of you is my savior ? this is Agent Clark . We 're with the NSA . Dexter Abbott sent us . it 's about bloody time . Never mind . - and I 'll forgive you both . - Or ... and you can get your own amenities ? about that . Tiny problem . unfortunate conduct in their lounge . - So where are you staying now ? - It 's a moving target . we can take you back to Abbott 's office . Please . Not looking like this . I don 't mind the occasional " walk of shame " ... God knows I 've done enough of them ... But this one could be a career ender . if you want to come back to my place and clean up . car 's right over here . Professional courtesy . Nothing here matches the images in stitch . Apple tree . Blossoms . Roots underground . It 's for hidden . Snake and apple . It 's like Adam and Eve . Is it a relationship gone wrong or a relationship gone right ? You 're working too hard . Pretty much the first time I 've ever been accused of that . Yeah . I think ... or a word fragment . It 's a language . That only our John Doe knew . I should loop Ivy in on this . She 's really good at this sort of thing . Really ? Ivy again ? You 'd like her if you got to know her . I 'm sure she 's lovely or something . I know ... to use your words ... you were paying attention . But we gotta get past this . Ivy is important to me . I 'm sorry supporting her before didn 't work out . It bit me in the ass . But that 's not my fault . Or yours . Can 't we please just move on ? I 'm seeing Ivy today after work . Why don 't you join us ? Drinks ? uh ... I already have plans tonight . You have plans ? You 're seeing someone ? Oh . Who is he ? so not a word . I 'm dating the medical examiner who works with the program . - Amanda ? But she 's ... - Uh-huh . Stay woke . that 's all . Ugh ! Fine . Screw drinks . Bring Ivy to the house for dinner tonight . Amanda and I will cook . - Are you sure ? - Yes . nobody in the lab knows about Amanda . so ... don 't ... Don 't worry . I got it . Lips are sealed . That 's a language I understand . Taxi ! now what 's the game plan ? now MI6 has to hold up theirs . We 'll tell Abbot that we rescued his agent and hopefully he can find out who our John Doe is . text me after you talk to him . - I figured you 'd go . - And you 'd stay here ? - It is my loft . - You made the deal with Abbott . Agent Goodkin ... do you happen to have something I can wear while my clothes dry ? so I washed them in your sink . Agent Clark can help you with that . I ... was just leaving . John Harrington . He was a mid-level agent with us . I had no idea how serious this was . I assume Harrington was here on a case . not recently . yes . the NSA 's gonna need to see the file for the case he was working on . it 's been scrubbed . we need to cooperate with each other . NSA is hard to cooperate with . with him as part of his cover . She was unaware it was a business trip . right from the hotel where she was going to meet John . Kidnapped ? payments dead-dropped . She is presumed dead . Body never found . Harrington went balls-to-the-wall to find her killer . but he 'd have none of it . came back here on his own dime . to find him . How do you know Belinda isn 't still alive ? Because the animal who took her shot off her index finger and mailed it to Harrington . Are you and Agent Goodkin more than just professional acquaintances ? Agent Marks . I don 't believe that 's any of your business . Kirsten . Think of this as inter-agency cooperation . female MI6 agents like you ? I wish . Imagine the fun . Is that your mission ? To bring fun to MI6 ? do you ? neither did my family . I had a very privileged upbringing . What 's the old saying ? With great privilege comes stuffy parents . I went for it . - To rebel ? - To make a difference . Cameron just texted . Abbott said the agent 's name was John Harrington and that you were looking for him in the days before he was killed . he was my first assignment . Cocked that up good . Please tell me you 're close to finding his killer . Ugh . It 's Abbott . He 's summoning me . Talk of " stuffy . did you know that ? no . Hmm . It 's interesting Abbott didn 't tell you . but I 'll pick Abbott 's brain when I see him . I 'll let you know . Harrington 's wife 's name is Belinda . Try this on . We know that Old High German for " bright serpent " is Betlinde . The golden snake is Belinda . That 's ... possible . But that would mean Harrington 's death memory is of him so ... Let 's try this . Harrington " cut " from MI6 to search for his wife . - His wife 's the swan ? - Swans mate for life . new topic . How long do you think it would take you to break a six-digit code on the credenza in Maggie 's office ? Think whatever 's inside that credenza might have something to do with how our cases get picked . I need to know everything . Just ask her . She might tell you . she might not . Never ask a question you don 't want to hear the answer to . Hours to weeks . Long as it gets done before Maggie gets back . How goes twisted Pictionary ? I 'm callin ' it . Everyone go home . Get some rest . huh ? boss never sleeps . I 'm good . You didn 't let me finish . Can I help you decide where we 're gonna take-out from tonight ? an Irish adventurer who was recruited to be a spy . Art imitating life ? Hope you don 't mind . I let myself in . It 's lovely . Thank you . Are you okay to talk about what happened ? Abbott was miffed I lost Harrington ... - and got pinched by the cops . - Doesn 't explain the violence . Don 't let Abbott 's bearing fool you . He 's an animal . Used to brag about waterboarding detainees . something must 've set him off . I did ask him about his relationship with Harrington . What 'd he say ? Nothing . That 's when he went balls-off on me . You must 've hit a nerve . You think Abbott could 've killed Harrington ? Pushed him off a roof ? he 's far too clean . maybe Abbott wanted it to look like someone-not-as-clean did it . It 's not my problem anymore . I 'm done with MI6 . I did not sign up for ... this . So I quit . Have an early morning flight back to London . Tomorrow . you 'll stay here until then . It 's safer . You can have Cameron 's room . We 'll take the couch . Both of you ? Together ? Cozy . are you sure your friends are cool with mezcal ? not everyone 's into the smoky taste . don 't worry about Linus . Ivy might be more of a wild card . You are so ... I can 't even describe it . - That 's them . - I 'm glad we 're doing this . hello and welcome . it 's great to see you again . - Mm-hmm . - Amanda ? I 'm Ivy . - Mm-hmm . And this is a Mezcal Mule . It 's my grandma 's recipe . She drank like a pirate . We brought wine . perfect . You guys just chill . Amanda and I will finish making dinner . Yeah . - Shiitake for a green pepper ? - Deal . but Agent Marks cleaned me out pretty good . Hmm . She had a rough day . Aah . Rough two days . it 's Maggie . All of Harrington 's files were scrubbed except the one he was working on here . because it never existed . what are the odds ? It 's called a mind palace . Could the sum of the letters of cow be the answer ? it 's a language . Welcome to " Around Los Angeles in 80 Bites . These are my favorite appetizers from my favorite restaurants . Just please try my gnocchi before you decide who 's Top Chef in this relationship . I 'll grab ' em . you wanna be a dear and help Amanda ? Oh . I 'm pretty sure I don 't need any help . It 's on a high shelf . You 're my pocket bae . Tall-ish Linus to the rescue . listen . Please don 't hurt Camille . Wow . Where did that come from ? From someone who really cares about her . like me ? - I mean me . what is my game ? I don 't trust you . but if you hurt Linus in any way ... What makes you think I would hurt Linus ? let me think . Genetics ? but ... Hold up . I 'm warning you " ? Do you have any idea what I do for a living ? I know nine different ways to kill you and make it look like natural causes . So why don 't you get the frickin ' crackers before I show you number eight ? I 'm not my father . I like Linus for who he is . - There 's no ulterior motives . - If you 're using him I 'd say that qualifies as an ulterior motive . Trixy-bits for everyone . Yummy ! Quincy ? I have to talk to you about something . Good or bad ? I 'm not sure yet . I got a call from a friend of mine at the DOJ . My name has come up in some meetings and there might be an opening there ... - for me . - It 's what you 've always wanted . - It probably won 't happen . - Hey . here we are . This is great . Yes . This is . Mm . Mm . This is way better than sex . maybe not better than sex . right ? We need to get everyone to the lab . - What 's up ? - I think Abbott ... is way more involved than he 's letting on . I 'll shoot a text to the team . what about Chloe ? She shouldn 't be alone . no . he 'll be able to figure out my address . This loft 's in my name . my house isn 't . It 's in Ed Clark 's name . wake her up . Tell her there 's a change in venue . Okay . She sleeps naked . You wake her up . I 'll text . - Camille ? - Yeah . Got Cameron 's text . Let 's go . wait . This is Chloe Marks from MI6 . I 'm sure . - Likewise . Cool if she stays here tonight ? Mmm . I 'm ... not sure tonight is the best ... Why not ? Because she 's already got an overnight guest . Of course she can stay . meet Kirsten and Chloe . Kirsten you know about . Chloe is an MI6 agent in grave danger . very exciting . I work with the dead . then you must know my family . I like this one . Why don 't you guys run off and Chloe and I will swap horror stories . We won 't be long . loads . Take your time . - We won 't be too long . I hope . - Okay . please don 't make it a thing . I was going to say that I 'm happy for you . Amanda seems great . Yeah . Look at this . - A cow . - And this ? A cow . Alex ? you ruined my evening over this " for a thousand . it 's not a baby cow . It 's a miniature breed . It 's called a Dexter cow . As in Dexter Abbott . The cow on the mind palace was standing on a terracotta tile . Dexter was on the roof of the hotel which has terracotta tiles . or killed him himself ? Let 's go with option number three . Just got ballistics . Bullet found on the roof was typed through Interpol . It is from Abbott 's weapon . Let Maggie know what we found . see if he 's there . Proceed with caution . We 'll go to the consulate and check his office . boss . my dear Fisher . See . Not here . Okay . Got it . Everything okay ? Um ... your boss was attacked in his office . He was shot . Dexter ? my God . Is he dead ? He lost a lot of blood and is heavily sedated . and just hunker down until she gets back . Why ? Am I in danger ? drink some more vino ... and it 'll all be fine . boss . Prepare to kneel before me . You worked up an oxytocin filter ? Yeah ... funny story about that . No . So why am I kneeling before Zod ? Once we knew that the cow represented Dexter I was able to develop a codex . We now have an interpretation protocol to help us unravel all of Harrington 's mind palace images . Very cool . boys ? - Let 's find out if Zod is right . Zod is always right . thanks to Dr. Ahluwalia we might have a filter that unravels Harrington 's mind palace . please . no-go for ... uh ... I 'll take it from here . You sure ? but it also made me realize that I need to be in control of my own mind so ... I 'm working on that . I 'm good . dude . we 're back on the air and playing all your favorite hits . no-go for stitch neurosync . Life-Sci ? Go . - Sub-Bio ? - Go . Big Bopper . - Excellent reference . Communications ? - Communications are a go . - Medical ? - Go . Easy Listening . one ... we 'll be right back after this ... mark . Memories are still encrypted . Just gimme a moment . Any chance we can mind map more of this region while we 're here ? teamwork . - Okay . Codex filter should be kicking in . - Kirsten ? I see a door . It 's open . It 's filled with white . - More mind palace ? - No . Viable memories are beyond that door . how 's the mapping ? - Dense . It 's all white because the memories are encrypted and the area isn 't fully mapped . Mapping takes time . Your call . Stay or move on ? Let 's move . - Think of the end game . - I am . Catching whoever shot Harrington . I 'm going through . and it 's not encrypted . Nice job . we are gathered here today ... he 's the groom . It 's his wedding to Belinda . Abbott 's here too . take you ... just like in Harrington 's memory . And a family crest . It 's the swan and the sword . Come to mama . Okay . Swan and the sword seal 's a crest belonging to the Lindsay Family of Ireland . but they didn 't touch Irish Marriage records . Hello and how do you do ? Harrington was married the fourth of March . - Four marching soldiers . - Bride was Belinda Lindsay . A beautiful snake . to be my husband . I understand . What ? The snake coiled around the cow ... and Harrington must have found out about it . Until death do us part . That means that Belinda was on the roof with Abbott . They killed Harrington together . Pull up what you can on her . Until death ... death ... death ... death . She wanted her family ring back . It was probably stuck . That 's why she shot his finger off . we 're burning daylight . Death moment 's upon us . You got eyes on bridezilla ? my God . my God . - Camille ! - I 'm bouncing . and she 's in my house right now ! I 'm definitely a Ravenclaw . - Oh . - Mm-hmm . Yes . hey . I 'd have saved you a plate . Is that Camille ? just finished work early . Early ? It 's almost dawn . Camille . Thanks so much for letting me stay here . Amanda are I are now good friends . Oh . I hope . Is it hot outside ? You 're sweating . It 's a little ... humid . can I talk to you on the porch real quick ? Hey . Are you sure Amanda doesn 't want her phone ? go . Hope you 're hungry . We saved you some plates . I usually do this on dead people . Yeah ? How do I compare ? Umm ... sexier than some . Aah ! Thanks for saving my life . something snapped inside me . I was just so afraid of losing you . I don 't let people in . It 's not who I am . It 's not who I ... raised myself to be . But I let you in . It must be scary . I 'm so scared . But I 'm so excited . My life makes sense with you in it . aren 't you ? And why not ? We got the bad guys . A murderous MI6 agent who slept naked in my bed ... pal . both of whom are going to spend the rest of their lives in jail . that 's inter-agency cooperation . why not just get a divorce ? and it was way more fun and kill her husband when her first plan crashed and burned . gotta give him credit . He used the NSA to get her out of jail . not the NSA . eye-ther . Poor Harrington . All he had to do was forget about Belinda after she went missing . he couldn 't . He loved her . not even her death . for saving me in Abbott 's office . You 're welcome . uh ... - Yips . - Yeah . - Yeah ? so the other day ... - Hmm ? - I 'm sitting here ... - With your feet on the desk . - Absolutely . - Yes . When I hear this buzzing sound ... - Mm-hmm . - Coming from inside that cabinet . I got Harrington 's stitch alert . - Related ? - I think so . I think there 's a device in there that 's connected to how our cases get picked . - It 's a six-digit unlock code . - Mm-hmm . Randomized . And the code changes every 15 minutes . This will take forever . Welcome to forever . Linus . If we can only find out where this gets its information from ... and we can pick the ones that will help us the most . Remember how I said I 'd help you save your mother ? Yes . I meant it . Hmm . Promise me that if things don 't work out between us ... I 'll let you keep your fingers .

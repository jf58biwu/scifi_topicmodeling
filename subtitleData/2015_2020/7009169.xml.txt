 - Hello , Ms. Goderitch . - What happened to your voice ? Nothing . This is my truth voice . She 's more than suspicious . She 's investigating this shit , she 's starting to piece it together . Krystal is a naive subject . She has some delusions about her circumstance , but she 's harmless . Gotta keep her on the move . I thought my DNA was supposed to make it better . It takes time to develop a therapy . You don 't wanna go sticking your neck out for the Hendrixes . And why 's that ? He says they 're dealing pills out of Bubbles . I created you as a beautiful baseline . You 've seen the alternative . The carriers ? The device in Sarah ? But share the original 's genome , and together , we can make a cure . Beth , what the hell are you doing ? Now , you 're off the case . But you keep digging , and digging and digging . You can do this . Your ID , please . Your ID , please . Ma 'am , your ID . Thank you . I 'm glad the morale is good . Two dead test subjects in as many weeks is not . We 've got it under control . What good are your implants if patients keep tearing them out ? Thank you . Oh , dear ! - Uh , never mind ... - Here , Susan . I 'll go find someplace to wash up . Susan Duncan . I know you . I know everything . Are you ready to meet our original ? After all these years ... I feel electric . And when it 's done ? When I have my cure ? Perhaps we could go back to Tristan da Cunha . The summer you rescued me from Yale . I was researching the pathogenesis of rare disorders , you remember ? I remember the villa . With the lovely topaz roof . - It was red . - Of course . What was the name of the town nearby ? You 're testing me . - I 'm not glitching . - I 'm sorry . It 's been two months since your last cognitive exam . Hook me up right now . Susan gets to restart human cloning with new lab rats to study the genome . And in return , you get that bot out of your face , and we get to collaborate on a cure . Aren 't you and Scott well on your way to that ? The last viral vector didn 't work . And even if the next one does ... I may not have that much time , Sarah . Okay . So what are you gonna tell Siobhan ? She 's just gonna say no , so I think we set it up first . Are you sure ? Yeah . It 's not her life , is it ? It 's our decision . But we can 't help them cure CASTOR . If we give the Neos Kendall 's genome , they 'll have the sterilizing pathogen again . I may have a workaround , but you 're not gonna like it . And I 'm trying to , like , change my life right now . Like , I shouldn 't have to live my life that way . I need protective custody now . Because if Dyad doesn 't get me , then Brightborn definitely will . All right . Can I have your name , please ? Krystal Goderitch . With a " K , " in Krystal , obviously . Yeah , of course I 'm available , but you can 't call me here . What kind of attitude did you expect ? Hey . Mother or mistress , huh ? What are you doing , Arthur ? Nothing . I just wanted to , uh ... I wanted to thank you , for warning me about the Hendrixes . Yeah , you 're welcome . just , uh , just stay out of it . I 'll do that . Are you taking any medications , Ma 'am ? No . God , everyone thinks I 'm crazy , or they try to get my number . Oh , you know what , Constable , why don 't I handle that for you ? Hi , Detective Bell , homicide . Krystal Goderich , manicurist . You know , why don 't we take this somewhere more private ? You 're the boss . So I was kept in this room for like an hour , and then they just gave me free samples . Like , can you believe that ? Like , I 'm a whistle-blower , I 'm not gonna just , like , be paid off with free samples . Okay , wait , wait , wait . Let 's just back up for one second , okay ? Certainly . These people who are after you ... They 're targeting beauty professionals . Right . Yeah , and some of us know what they 're actually doing , which is hoarding patents in stem cell cosmetics . And totally testing on human beings . - Like , I 'm against animal testing . - Okay . Like , humans is , like , too far . - Do you know what I mean ? - Right . Does " LEDA " mean anything to you ? Yeah . I love their eyeliner . Okay . Dark Confidant and Time Walk are key . I never play without them anymore . Most people think rare cards must be awesome . Not so . Tell your son to play the game , not the market . Stop pestering my driver . - No smoking . - Here you go . Okay . Siobhan . I 'm glad you 're here . You all right , Ma ? Because you 're being really nice . It 's about my other daughters . I 'll let Cosima explain . Sarah Manning . Welcome to Brightborn . You 're Evie Cho , right ? I 'm gonna pass on the tour , Cosima doesn 't recommend it . - Did you come alone ? - No , I 've got an army outside . If I 'm not out in 20 minutes , your original takes an acid bath . You understand ? Then we better hurry . Susan 's waiting . Susan Duncan . Yeah , that 's the same look Leekie gave me . I 'm sorry . It 's just strange to see an unfamiliar face . Is that a joke ? No . You 're a mystery to me . I like that . Christ , a CASTOR ? Actually , I 'm , uh , a Libra . This is Ira , my assistant . A breed apart . From what , Dobermans ? I 'm nothing like my brothers , Ms. Manning . You 're safe here . Sarah , please sit . Before we discuss Kendall , I wanna know what this thing 's doing to me . The devices do different things for different subjects . For instance , you mentioned Aldous Leekie . He had one treating a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer 's . But what 's mine doing ? It 's making you sick . You 're immune to the disease . By activating specific genes , we hoped to isolate the illness . Apparently it hasn 't flicked off the right switch yet . Why , ' cause I 'm healthy ? Because you 're alive . We can have it out . We can start work on a cure today , if you just share Kendall . Only her unique biology makes human cloning possible . Those same cells could give you the CASTOR pathogen . So Cosima 's come up with a solution . What kind of solution ? Kendall Malone has cancer . Leukemia . Ma . You should 've ... You should 've told me . And seen that look for the rest of my life ? We can get a doctor . I mean , someone we can trust obviously and ... Chicken , it 's too late . And it 's not your choice . Cosima ? Tell her what you told me . Uh ... Kendall 's cancer might actually save us . Kendall 's a chimera , right ? Half her cells are CASTOR , the other half are LEDA . No way to tell which was which . Until now . So you have all these white blood cells and one of them goes nuts and starts multiplying like crazy , millions of cancer cells . All of those are clones of that first white blood cell . And luckily for us , the first one is ... It 's just got the LEDA , right ? The LEDA genome . Yeah , exactly . So , if we isolate those leukemia cells , we don 't give them CASTOR , we only give them LEDA . An ingenious solution . She 's good , your sister . Self-made . Well , I can see an obvious problem . You 're a biological weapon , mate . We 're not saving CASTOR . Susan ... Fetch me a hard drive , please . Ira , please . I accept your terms . But I want to be there when the samples are taken from Kendall . I thought you might . And I want Cosima 's research on the disease transferred to my hard drive . She 's closer to it than anyone , I think that her insights will be valuable . You 're not the first LEDA to make it this far , you know . - What are you talking about ? - Ira . Beth ? Beth thought she found her enemy . She was wrong . I hope you don 't make the same mistake she did . Put your hands up . How did you find me ? I 'm a cop . I have resources . I figured it out . You 're the head of the snake . You 're where this all ends . You 're mistaken . I 'm your creator . - I 'm invested . - Shut up ! Your mother 's name is Ruth , isn 't it ? - Yes . - Kind woman . Wanted a daughter more than anything . I was happy to oblige . We had no idea about your father . We screen for tendencies like that , somehow he got through . - I 'm sorry . - Stop it ! - You manipulate us . Turn around ! - We guide you . I saw you graduate . You recall ? Get on your knees . You polished that badge to a mirror shine . I said get down . Why are you doing this ? If I kill you , it 's over . The monitors . The testing . The lies . You control Neolution . No one controls the idea . Kill me and someone will take my place . But they will not protect you as I have . Protect us from what ? From my own mistakes . Beth , whatever you think you know , you must believe this . I have devoted my life to sustaining yours . Without me , your sisters will wither on the vine ... and I cannot bear that . I love you all . I love you . Close your eyes . We knew Beth was in deep , but trying to kill Susan Duncan ... So what stopped her ? Look at her . Another one thought she could do it all on her own . We had to make a deal , S. You bartered my mother behind my back . Cosima needs a cure , I need this bot out of my face . It 's trying to make me sick , S. Not just your neck 's on the line though , is it , Sarah ? Kendall agreed to it . I just got her back . Mum . I 'm sorry . I will do my part . I will keep Susan honest , and everyone safe . But this is the wrong play , Sarah . You 're putting us all at risk . You 'll meet Scott at Fee 's in an hour . Bring Benjamin . Leekie 's Alzheimer 's bot 's looking a little peaked . Suppose we should feed it some blood , like Little Shop of Horrors ? Yeah ' cause that ended well . Okay , here it is . One terabyte of data . Three months of blood , sweat , and fluid samples . Two relationships . One missing soulmate . Well , Shay was a rebound , so one-and-a-half relationships . One-and-three-quarters tops . I just don 't know if sharing this is a win , or ... Surrender ? We would have cracked it , if we had the time . Yeah . - Yeah , let 's do this . - Yeah . LEDA is everything . I wish you 'd understand . I do understand . You need your girls to build a better human . My life is expendable . Oh , please . Don 't talk like that . I don 't wanna die , Susan . I wanna be with you . I will find a way , for you as well . I promise . You believe me ? Sarah , I don 't get it . I 'm sorry , Art , I think when Beth couldn 't pull the trigger on Susan , she just couldn 't live with it . No , I watched that video hundred times . The wig , the gun . And then she comes back again . I mean , if she didn 't shoot anybody then ... - Why did she have blood on her hands ? - Exactly . What about this thing here ? Krystal thinks Vidal Sassoon 's after her . Krystal , shit . Uh , I 'll get Fee to call you , all right ? - He 's , uh , got a way with her . - Okay . You sure you and Cosima don 't need backup at Brightborn ? No , we 've got it covered . I should be bot-less in an hour . Sarah , you watch your back . This is what killed Beth . Arthur , this is a hare-brained scheme , who would buy it ? Actually , Krystal . Okay , yeah , fine , I 'll be there soon . Susan 's en route . You call me when you 're done with the hairdresser . She 's an aesthetician . We need to keep this situation under control , Fee . Just promise me that Adele is not gonna walk in . It 's a moot point , she went home . Felix , when this is all done , bring her back . I want the whole family here for Ma . Everyone . Kendall 's a tough old badger , Mum . Okay ? You 've still got time . - They 're coming up . - Yeah . They 're here . You all set ? Ready to separate the original 's cells . just need one original . Ma ? Showtime . Mrs. Malone . It 's an honor . Maybe this isn 't such a good idea after all . Hey . We 're gonna get that thing out of your face . - Uh-huh . - Okay ? Then we 'll take you for ice cream ... if you 're good . The extraction is safe , but delicate . We 'll put you under . You 'll sleep right through it . - No . Not her . - Why not ? I can still taste your partner 's fingers in my mouth . Yeah , I 'm assisting . I got your back . You can watch Scott work from there . Take a seat . Thank you . Cosima says they 've started . Last needle , I promise . Do you know why your biology is so unique , Mrs. Malone ? Just my bloody luck . Yes , you 're a true anomaly . The only clonable subject my husband ever found . No wonder he hid your identity so well . Hid me from the likes of you . Ethan saw the best in people . I see the most . And right now , you are the most valuable person in the world . What are those striations ? Nerves ? Neuromorphic grid , biofeedback , not hardcoding . More resilient that way . So it has instincts ? - Sorry . - Syringe ? Yeah . The implant reacts to heat and pressure variance . This enzyme neutralizes those receptors . Puts it to sleep . No toxic failsafe . Forceps . There you go . You 're doing really well , Sarah . Almost there . Ugh . It 's leaking toxin . I can 't extract without rupturing it . You 're okay . - Okay , we plug the leak , right ? - Yes . Just breathe , Sarah . If that toxin hits her blood stream , she 's dead . Okay . Here we go . Don 't move . - Don 't move . - It 's tearing . Now or never . - Don 't move . - Careful . Okay ... All right , now pull it out very , very carefully . Slowly , slowly . Good . Good job . Great . Great . You said it was safe . You must have damaged it trying to remove it . Hey , you did it . I 'm ready to aspirate the cancer cells . I 'm so sorry . You 're getting what you want , aren 't you ? I 'd spit , but she 'd probably bottle it . - What 's happening ? - It 's out . I 'm coming . - Get Kendall on the move . - Okay . Is Cosima still with Evie ? She 'll leave Brightborn as soon as Susan has her samples . Finish up , Scott . You 're done , Ma . Benjamin ! Before you leave , Mrs. Malone , I want to thank you . You won 't live to see it , but you have given us all a better future . Let 's go . I 'll see you later , Ma . You ... You did good . Watch her . It 's not over . - You got that lighter ? - Yeah . Wham ! I popped that husky masseur right onto his behind . But he must have had backup or something , and she must have had a green belt , 'cause she , like , had me in an arm lock before I could even block it . Okay . - Is that your guy ? - Listen , just relax , okay ? This guy knows more about this than anybody alive . Hello ! - What the hell are you wearing ? - What ? International intrigue lacks flair . Look , I just need to know that you can do this , all right ? I don 't want her to rabbit on us . She 's not gonna rabbit , okay ? It 's gonna be fine . - Krystal ... - Oh , my God ! - It 's okay . It 's okay . - Oh , my God ! You 're that guy who stole my wallet right before I was kidnapped . - Oh , yeah . - Um , well , Krystal , this is , um , Inspector Dawkins . From the Yard . What ya rd ? - Scotland Ya rd . - Yes . Oh . He 's a cop . From London . You said Scotland . Okay , that 's as far as that 's gonna go . Krystal , truth voice , right ? Do you remember what I said to you the first time we met ? - That I wasn 't alone ? - That 's right , darling . And you 're not alone in ... Oh , my God ! - Oh , Jesus ! - Oh , God , it burns ! - Oh , shit . - Put the mace away ! - I 'm ... I ... - Put it away ! What is wrong with you ? Ugh ! - You all right , Sarah ? - Brilliant . - Susan . - Hello , Sarah . - How are you , love ? - Been better . - These are done ? The samples ? - Uh , 52 LEDA cells . Just enough for a sustainable line . Which I will hand over once I get confirmation Cosima is free . She 's remarkable , Cosima . I wish Rachel had such an inquiring mind . They 're all so different . - Yeah , you have no idea . - Whoa ! Whoa , is that bleach ? - Are you out of your mind ? - Benjamin ! Thought I smelled trouble . You 've just destroyed yourself , you stupid girl ! Sarah , you wanna tell us what you 're doing ? Kendall 's driver 's not answering . I found her cigarettes in a pool of blood . Bathroom . - What have you done ? - I haven 't done anything . Bollocks ! Where 's my mother ? If anything 's happened , it wasn 't me . We have to go , S. Yeah , you 're coming with us . And your life depends on what happens next . - Do you understand me ? - Not just mine . What about Cosima ? She 's still at Brightborn . The power source is metabolic , from the host 's own tissue . A synthetic ATP chain . Nature is just a set of spare parts to you , isn 't it ? Well , I think of it more as a palette . Your research ? Tell me what happened to Delphine Cormier . Who ? The former head of Dyad . Oh . Doctor Cormier . Of course . Dyad 's not my purview . I 'm sorry . But I knew of her and her dedication to you . Yeah , that 's what I 'm afraid of . It 's her research on there too , isn 't it ? I couldn 't have done it without her . And what you started together , we can all finish with Kendall 's genome . Susan 's gone dark . What ? What 's going on ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm taking self-defense classes , so it was just , like , a reflex . Oh , is that what happened ? - I have Visine in my bag if you want it . - Nope , that 's all right . Uh , nothing more from your purse . Okay . Listen , just pull yourself together , okay ? She 's scared . Buck up . Oh , God . Aw , your poor skin . - No , really , it 's just a flesh wound . - I 'm so bad . Look , Krystal ... You need to know that you figured it out . It 's all true . All of it . There is this dirty war being waged on stem cell technology , trying to control it , and it 's all being orchestrated by the cosmetic companies . I knew it . Yes , yeah . All the big players are involved . Right , Art ? - Uh , Brightborn , Neolution ... - What 's Neolution ? They 're Swedish . - Oh . - Yes , quite European . - Oh , God . - Look , Krystal , the point is , while the case is still open , you need to just live your life as normally as possible . Go home . They can 't know we 're onto them . Our numbers are in here . For emergencies only , though . Are you okay ? I keep ... Ever since I smacked this French doctor at the Dyad , I just keep injuring people everywhere I go . I 'm so sorry . Do you mean Dr. Delphine Cormier ? Why , do you know her ? Is she involved in this ? Well , she 's a friend of ours . What can you tell us about her ? I 'm so sorry , um ... I saw her get shot . I saw everything . No one will find you here . Where is she ? Where 's Kendall ? You think I 'd kidnap Kendall and then allow myself to be taken hostage ? You 'll do anything . You hunted her down for 20 years . It wasn 't me ! It doesn 't make sense , does it ? You don 't actually believe her ? She 's got the genome , she doesn 't need to do this . But Ira does . No . He was there when we made the deal . A deal that denied him a cure . He wouldn 't betray me . Not even to save his own life ? Where would we find him ? There 's a key card in my pocket . We keep rooms at the Palmina , 708 . You got my ma into this . You better get her out . I 'll go with her . Shit . He 's glitching ! Hey , hey . Wake up ! Where 's Kendall ? Hello , where 's Kendall ? Hey ! Shit . Stupid bugger . He 's OD 'ing . Call 911 . He 's a dead end , Benjamin . Where 's Kendall ? So how 're we doing back here ? There you go . Why am I out here ? It won 't be long . If you 're too cold , I have a spare blanket . Nasty business that we 're wrapped up in , isn 't it ? Someone 's got their hooks in ya . I 've been hunted around the world . What 's your story ? I 'm just in over my head , lady . Just like everybody else . We can help you . My daughter , she hides people . How 's that working out for you ? Least I can look her in the eye . You 're shivering . I 'll get you that blanket . Ira tried to kill himself . Benjamin 's watching him at the hospital . He 's had his stomach pumped , he 's fine . Forget about Ira . What have your vipers done with my mother ? S ! S ! S ! That 's enough . Scott ? There 's some kind of Trojan wiping our research . Wha ... How 's that possible ? Your system 's offline . It had to be introduced on the hard drive from Brightborn . Sarah , we 're done . Everything 's gone . Cosima 's data 's been wiped . It 's a coup . - Competing technologies . - I 'm sorry , what 's happening ? Whoever did this doesn 't care about Kendall 's genome . They just want LEDA destroyed . Who ? The engineer . Mrs. Malone , you should 've stayed hidden . I take it this is the one who has you all twisted up . I 'm sorry , it has to play out like this . You have your precious original . Let her go . Stay there . This is compressed triethylaluminium . Burns at 1,200 degrees . And we 've confirmed all her samples are destroyed . There will be nothing left . Susan , please , you have to tell us , where would Evie take Kendall ? Beth . What are you talking about now ? That 's why she wanted to kill me . Beth held a gun to my head . And Evie put it in her hand . She didn 't do it , Detective Duko . She left Susan on her knees . I 'm in the car . Get down here . - Beth ... - You set me up . No , I didn 't . You ... You said you wanted to put an end to this , to free your sisters . By killing the head of Neolution . She made us . She needs us . Not you . You just want to take her place . It 's not happening ! Oh , it is . I 'll find another way . Susan 's done , just like your sisters . - Don 't talk about my sisters . - Beth , you know too much now . If you run , Neolution will cauterize your life . Alison , Cosima , your parents , Paul . - Then I 'll pull the trigger right now . - You won 't end it . You wanna save the people that you love ? Use that gun on yourself . Do you think I 'm afraid to die ? Do you think I 'm scared of anything right now ? Why are you doing this ? I never understood what Susan saw in that face . In the decades of watching your tedious lives , while technology just passed her by . Clones are obsolete . You 're Betamax . Because of the bots ? We don 't need your baseline , we ... We can fix people now . You can 't perfect the human genome . You can 't know what perfect is ! I know . I was born sick . I 'm sick , too . That doesn 't justify this . Da Vinci robbed graves to study anatomy . In hundred years , they 'll call me a pioneer . Please don 't do this . Say goodbye . Quickly . - Please , please . - Stop there . Kendall , what 'll we do ? No tears , Cosima . These shites aren 't worth the salt . Tell Siobhan she 's done right . Always . And tell your sisters I 'm proud to have been part of them all . Step back . Turn around , love . Turn around . Good girl ! Delphine Cormier was shot dead at the Dyad parkade . Oh , my God ! Tell Susan the original 's dead . Tell Sarah it 's over , or Beth died for nothing . Beth ! - Don 't make me kill a cop . - Don 't make me . Is it true ? Will my sisters die for what I know ? They 've done it before . What 's your play , Beth ? It 's over ! We 're done . I 'm done ! I screwed it up . We can 't fight this anymore , Mika . Neolution will cauterize your life . Alison , Cosima , your parents , Paul . You wanna save the people that you love ? Use that gun on yourself . You need to drop all this . Go back into hiding . Drink iced tea , play video games , whatever . Just stay hidden . I have to keep everyone that I care about safe . Please don 't leave me . And you want that , too . Don 't you , Beth ?

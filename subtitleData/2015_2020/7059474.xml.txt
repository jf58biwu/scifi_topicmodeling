 Westmorland isn 't 170 ! He just assumed this identity to sell his story . Well , if everyone on the island bought into PT 's myth , do you think the Neolution board did too ? We need to still go after this Al-Khatib guy . The Neo bagman ? He 's so protected it 's not even funny . If he is bribing governments for citizens ' genetics , - then we 've got to ... - Leave it , luv . - Empty seats ? - Suicides . Rachel must have shown the Cabal our proof of PT 's real identity . They 're realising they 've been had . They 're scrambling to protect themselves . - Have you found her ? - No . Is she lying ? You 're forgiven . - You ready ? - Full financial records of Neolution 's dark money bribes . It 's all going public . Helena ! _ _ _ _ Sestra Irina ! _ _ _ _ Some of you know more of what we 've been through than others . But you all knew S ... didn 't go anywhere without a fight . And that fight was for all of us . Her people . Her network . Her family . ♪ I 'll gently rise and I 'll softly call ♪ ♪ Good night ♪ ♪ And joy be with you all ♪ She wrote us a letter , the three of us , before she was taken . Okay . Okay . You 're okay . I 'll do it , it 's all right . I 've got it . Okay . It 's okay . " Just remember , my loves ... Death is nothing at all . I have only slipped into the next room . You can call me by my old familiar name . Put no sorrow in your tone . I promise we will laugh at this difficult parting when we meet again . All my love . S. " You wanna put the rose ? Go on . It breaks my heart not being there for them . Yeah , well , Delphine gets back tomorrow from France , so we can all go over together and see them . Today is for S 's people . I can 't even begin to process Siobhan , I can 't imagine what Sarah 's going through . God , she found her own mother ... Felix says she hasn 't even cried yet . She 's probably just trying to be strong for Kira . She always has to be strong . It 's not right . - It 's not right . - Well , we 'll pick her back up . Right ? The bribes now connect Kuwaiti businessman Hashem Al-Khatib to the fringe futurist movement Neolution . A multinational investigation has taken control of all research , and suspended the financial activities of the wider Dyad Group . Al-Khatib remains at large . Our reporters are on the scene at the Dyad Institute ... Mum ? Will be updating the story as the investigation unfolds . Hey . I know you don 't think you don 't need this , but you do . It 's my turkey chili . Thanks . Bloody Rachel is behind this . I know , but S didn 't blame Rachel . Her letter was clear ... I don 't care . She could have done something to stop it . Sarah , I want you to know that ... what S did , this sacrifice ... it 's for my family too . Neolution threatened all of us . So whatever you need , however , whenever ... Hello . To speak to ... ? All right . Hey . I think she wants you . Sister Irina . She doesn 't talk . You all right ? - Oh no ... - What 's that ? It 's Helena 's journal . Okay , I 'm inside the cervix , and separating the membranes . - Are you sure you have to do this ? - Natural inducement technique . 35 weeks is nearly full term for twins . We need to get this done in a hurry . There are too many people looking for us . What about Gracie ? Be patient , Mark . After the birth , she 'll join us . - Until then , I need you on security . - Mark ... Relax , Helena . Mark . Mark ! My dear child . So this is where I finally find you . I 've been searching for so long . My name is Tomas , and I 'm going to take care of you . You don 't know how special you are . Gracie came to see her ? How did she find her ? Helena wouldn 't have kept in contact with that bible thumping little traitor . All we know is that they 're both gone . Guys ? She said there was blood in the room . Oh , my God . They 're grabbing Helena just as her babies - are coming to term . - He wants cord blood , the mutation ... For himself , and then to exploit . Last time we saw Gracie , who did she sell us out to ? Virginia Coady . Are they taking her to the island , Cosima ? We don 't know - what 's going on out there anymore . - We know someone who might . You mean Rachel ? No . All right , then , what do you want to do ? Kira has lost her grandma . What am I supposed to do ? Okay . So you need to be here with her . Hey , hey ... I 've got this , Sarah . And I can 't sit still , so I gotta come with you . - Don 't move , Rachel . - Felix , I 'm sorry for your loss . Save your bloody breath , you heartless bitch , and turn around . They took Helena . To the island , presumably . I wouldn 't be so certain . Neolution will survive Rachel 's betrayal , but the stress has taken its toll on you , so you should be cautious with this . Yes . Yes . I need to be sharp . We 've got work to do . And after this , find Al-Khatib and continue your cleanup . It 's been going very well so far . Thank you , sir . Those of us who are left are behind you 100 percent . Good . Good . Well . Let 's , uh , have some twins , shall we ? ! Well , Siobhan knew what she was getting into , Felix ... Shut your bleeding mouth and get back to Helena . - Why not the island ? - It 's not safe there for him anymore . His subjects have rebelled and abandoned him . Powerful people have been exposed , and they 're vengeful . So you 're running from them too . Good luck . Yeah . You can barely walk . - When was Helena abducted ? - Four days ago , the night of my art opening . Your opening , Felix ... That 's the day Enger went AWOL . Detective Enger . That is who I would pick . She 's devoted to the cause . - I 'm coming with you . - You 're staying here . - What for ? - To make yourself useful . Here 's an old friend to make sure you do . Hey . Hello , Rachel . - Felix ? - Hey . - How you doing ? - Uh , fine . What have you found ? Well , we 're back in the frigid blue arms of the police . We think Enger 's the one who took Helena . They want you next . Interpol . Just took over two fresh murder cases from us . What murders ? This " Neolution " thing . You wanna tell me how you 're connected ? - Wait , what did Enger say ? - Enough to get me listening . So you have no idea how wrapped up in this she is . No , I don 't , but I 'm gonna get to the bottom of it . - Ow sit your ass down . - Lieutenant . I don 't know what you know . You could be Neolution yourself . But I have to gamble that you 're still police , like me . And like Beth was . We 've done all we can naturally . - It 's just a matter of time . - No dilation - from the membrane sweep ? - As soon as it happens , we 're ready . We 'll harvest the fetal stem cells and begin processing a treatment for you immediately . No , I can 't wait . Cut them out . John , a C-section will have unpredictable epigenetic effects on our prime subjects . - We need a natural birth . - You sound just like Susan . - You can hold on a little longer . - Oh , can I ? If you won 't C-section , I want hormone induction ! - John ... - Do it , Virginia ! No , please ! Let me out ! No , please ! Let me out ! Please ! Filthy dirty copulators . Do you touch yourself too ? Tell me about the copies . Vony khodyat ' op zemli . English , Helena . They walk the earth . While the original is at home with God . She 's beautiful . I protect her from science devils . Well , welcome back . We 're going to start a Pitocin drip , Helena . It 'll induce labour . But the babies aren 't ready yet . They 'll be fine , twins are usually premature . He makes you do this . Like he made you kill Gracie . You are his puppy dog . Woof , woof ! Coward . Contractions will start soon . The more you resist , the harder it will be on these babies . Don 't make this more difficult than it already is . - I don 't like that look . - Two Neo board members found dead . Ian Van Lier ? His body washed up on the Humber River this morning . - They 're covering their tracks . - Yeah , and Enger 's in there stitching me up to Interpol right now . Luckily my boss isn 't in on it . He wants me to keep digging on the DL . So , Siobhan 's list has nine board members . Two suicides . Van Lier . And then who 's the other body ? - Francine Bernard , Convoy Technologies . - Yes , she was in charge of alternative facts , whitewashing the eugenic agenda . That 's what the Board is for ... insulation . Okay , I got two more , Korean politician Seong Pak , found hanging in her office , and insurance magnate Jules Martin , reported missing by his wife . Okay , so that leaves three board members alive , including Al-Khatib , the money guy . He may know John 's plans . Where do we find him , Rachel ? You can eliminate the Board , John , but we still need protection . We 'll get it . We have the mutation . Life . The fountain of youth . What we don 't need are old liabilities . We 've synthesized his pathogen . Time to move on . Put him down . He 's the sole remaining Castor ! Yes . His loyalties lie with the dead girl . I did not want Gracie killed . You ordered that to force this . Virginia , it 's always been you and I with the strength to act . The future is female ! Haven 't you heard ? My assets have been frozen , my visa revoked , but he has the science . I simply seek assurances that my involvement will continue . We understand you 've opened up a dialogue with Interpol . A delay tactic , on the advice of my counsel . I told them nothing . I will tell them nothing . We need assurances of our own . Hellooooo ! Well , it was absolute murder , but I completely reconfigured the seating arrangements and I got a brand new colour palette and ... Suddenly I feel like I 'm in the wrong boardroom , or maybe I 'm early . Get your hands in the air ! Now ! I 've broken no laws , Detective . Sit your ass back down in that chair . And I have a permit for this gun . Don 't test me . Don 't do it ! Dammit . Christ , Art ... - This can 't fall on you . - I 'm fine . - Bullshit . - Okay , look , this ... This whole Neolution investigation now includes me , and this sure as hell wasn 't line of duty . You did what you had to do . The only thing that matters now is getting Helena back . I swear , I don 't know where he 's hiding her . Well , your friend Rachel wants to be sure . How many courses of the cure after this one ? This should be the final one . Gracie 's thinking of becoming a dental hygienist . And you ? I thought about being a teacher , you know ? Phys ed , maybe . But you gotta go to college for that . You were always the fastest swimmer out of all your brothers . You , um , you remember those races down by the lake ? Rudy used to hate losing so much . Well , you could teach swimming while you go to school . Why ... why am I so tired ? Sometimes the vaccine causes drowsiness . Why don 't you close your eyes ? Take a nap . When you wake up , you 'll be that much closer to Gracie . I 'm so happy . I know . Goodnight , Mum . Goodbye , Mark . Contraction . First one . Get this off her , she needs to breathe . Inhale through your nose , exhale through your mouth . Breathe , Helena . Breathe . There you go . Good . Breathe . Breathe . That 's good . Look at you . All your games and toys forgotten . So much purpose in your mind . You 're ready . I will make you proud . Dirty copies ... They pervert His original . - Yes ... - His light . I will cleanse them from this earth . They look like me . I am a copy . No , child . You are the original . You are so special . Don 't you see ? They copied your body , but not your soul . I am the original ... ? You are the light . I am the Original . I am the light . I am not special . I 'm a copy like my sestras ... Shh , shh , shh ... You let him take your babies . Please . Not mine . They need their mother . Well , that 's just not true , Helena . You forget , I know who you are . Dumped at birth . A killer . You killed your own sisters . You stink like an animal . What kind of mother could you possibly make ? Call for me when she 's dilated to 8 centimeters . I told you , I don 't know where he 's taken the science . - Her name is Helena . - Fine . You shot the one person who did know where she is . Mr. Frontenac was there to terminate you . I know you don 't like debt , but that puts you squarely in ours . Hey , Sarah . We 've still got nothing . I 'm with Kira and she said Helena 's in trouble . I can feel her . Her babies are coming . I see only two options for you . Either we hand you over to John , or we hand you over to the authorities . Third option , I pull the trigger for the second time today . I don 't know ! Please ! All I know is the person with the biggest target on their back is her . Rachel ... Rachel . - Yes . - If he wants you so bad , I say we give you up . Contractions are strong and steady . She 's an hour or two away . Good . Stay with her . Euthanizing Mark was a necessity . How are you feeling ? I 'm going for a smoke . Sir ? Hashem Al-Khatib . Frontenac must have messed up . You 're still with us . And I 'd like to keep it that way , by offering you something that you value far , far more than me . And what could that possibly be ? Guys , do you have any idea how insane this plan is ? Do you realize how many things could go wrong ? Yes , and so does she . Art 's on top of it , alright ? We 've got a tracking device on the car . They 're gonna lead us right to Helena . So then what 's she supposed to do when she gets to wherever they 're taking her ? Stall . John will want an audience with me before he cuts off my head . Sarah will have to keep him busy . _ _ _ _ _ Art , have you got eyes on Sarah ? Close . I 'm right behind , tracking her . Is anyone else finding this route familiar ? Why would they go anywhere near Dyad right now ? It 's been swarming with investigators since Siobhan outed Al-Khatib as the Neo bagman to the press . Rachel ? Why ? I expect he still has the authorities there in his pocket . The front entrance is a zoo . No way Helena 's in there . Enger 's driving past the front entrance . - They 've stopped to the East . - They 're taking her to the Old Wing . That 's where we used to work . I thought they closed down the Old Wing . We did . The balls . He 's hiding right next to Dyad as it self-destructs . We practically lived in that building . It 's a converted asylum , it 's basically impenetrable . Well , I worked security . - I can get us into that wing . - He 's paranoid , trusting only a few . If Sarah can keep him ranting long enough , then ... we 'll have a chance . - You 're sitting in my chair . - Your turn to snip loose ends , John . Leave us ! Will you tell me about Helena 's birth ? - I 'm curious . - You gave all that up , remember ? Dr. Coady ! Miss ? Can you hear me ? - What 's happening ? - Hypovolemic shock . Jesus ! - Persistent fetal deceleration . - What have you done ? Here . Take these off . - You got it ? - Here we go . - Pull it up . - Got it , got it , got it . Goddamn you ! Secrets . I know yours , Rachel . I know how you cup your hands just so , so you can hide that digging at your fingernails that you can 't stop . I know how you constantly write letters to your biological mother - who you never met . - Stop it . I know how you touch yourself in the shower , where you think it 's clean ... Stop it ! Father ... You could 've had everything if you 'd trusted me . Father ? You 've never called me that before . You knew it was how I felt . Daughter . Sarah . Ah ! I got it . Stay down . Down ! - Get down ! - All right . Let go of me , you bitch ! Let go ! I think we 've had enough of this one . John ! Stop ! Are you all right ? - Oh , I 'm invigorated ! - I have an emergency . Helena 's in trouble . She needs a compatible transfusion . I need her blood , now . Sarah . - She came in as Rachel . - Now she can save her sister . Just coming through . Live organ . - Live organ . - Paperwork , IDs ... Paperwork was sent ahead . Ask Dr. Lim . He 's just dropping off . Pediatric heart transplant . Bit of a rush . Thank you . Helena ? Helena ? Lacerated radial artery . I had to suture . How much blood loss ? - A litre , maybe two . - Check on John . He 's injured . - What did you do to her ? - She did this to herself . If you want to help save your sister , make a fist and don 't fight me . Okay . Good . Now release . Come on , Helena . Come back to me . Come on , come on , come on . Come on , meathead . Stay with me . - What 's that for ? - I have to section her . You can 't cut her open ! She 's lost too much blood ! If she 's not conscious to deliver , I have no choice . Helena ? Come on , wake up . Meathead , come on ! Wake up ! Hey . Over here . I 'm here . Hey . She 's awake , Coady . I 'm right here . Why did you do that , eh ? The heart rates are steadying . That 's good . Thanks to you , we 're still in business . I 'm sorry , sestra . Uh ... Anytime would be good . Uh ... - Still closed . - How about now ? Are you sure the alarm 's a good idea ? Yeah , I want them here , so I get first drop . Go see what 's happening . Listen , you get your friend - and you get clear , all right ? - Art , I wanna help . Scott . You did good . Now it 's my turn . That 's good . Contractions restarting . I need water . Here . Jesus Christ . You are shit mother . - What do we do ? - Take . Here . Hurry ... The key 's there , on the tray . They will come back . I 'm gonna get you out of here . Come on , up , up . Oh , babies coming .

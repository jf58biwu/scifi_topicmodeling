 Sarah : Clones . Paul : Genetic identicals . Sarah : Yeah , we counted nine of us so far . ( screams ) When beth died , I took her identity . You 're her monitor . You observe her and she killed herself Because the man that she loved Turned her whole life into a lie . Who the hell is maggie chen ? Sarah : That 's the woman beth shot . A neolution gives us the opportunity At self-directed evolution . Nealon : Wherever you think the science is at , I guarantee you 're wrong . - ( grunting ) - ( choking ) Sarah : They haven 't just infiltrated leda , They run castor too . Both projects . I hate neolutionists . I assume you have a plan to hide your dear mum . - We might . - Ferdinand : Good . Far away . I don 't need to know where . ( groans ) ( twig breaks ) ( gasps and whimpers ) ( inhales ) ( panting ) ( mobile vibrating ) ( exhales loudly ) - Hello ? - Woman : ( whispering ) I saw them . The cheek choppers . - Mk ? - ( breathing heavily ) - Follow the coordinates . - What ? Remember , don 't trust anyone next to you . Beth ? - Who 's that ? - ( mobile beeps ) No one . ( sighs ) ( beth sighs ) ( mobile chimes ) What is this ? You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . ( snorting ) Sorry , tip from a source . What time will I see you later ? Why ? I wanna make you dinner . You 're being a cop in your own bedroom again . Yeah , it 's a problem . ( sighs ) But dinner would be nice , yeah . Go easy out there . ( door opens and closes ) ( mobile chimes ) ( sighs ) ( breathing heavily ) ( theme music playing ) ( indistinct police radio chatter ) Art : The call came in the middle of the night ? What kind of anonymous tip Brings you all the way out here ? Hell if I know . Art : Think it 's one of your ci 's ? Beth : Uh , I didn 't recognise his voice . Art : Did you get any sleep at all ? You look like shit . - Beckwith : Hey . - Hey . - Hey . - Body bag ? Beckwith : Tidy , huh ? Of a brand widely used by mortuary And emergency services . - Shall we open our present ? - Both : Yeah . Okay , well that 's cheeky . Cause of death ... I 'd have to go with exploding cigar . - ( camera shutter clicks ) - good , case closed . Beckwith : Huh . - That 's mildly interesting . - Wait a minute , just one ? Yeah . ( sighs ) Ink . Thanks , gorgeous . We just wanna know your name . ( scoffs ) Well , damn . You ever seen one of those before ? Surgically bifurcated penis . - He did that to himself ? - Mmm-hmm . But I don 't see any advantage to that . Perhaps it 's a statement of masculine / feminine duality , arthur . No , it isn 't . Beth : Okay , so our guy 's into body mod , So is that what the cheek 's about ? Well , the cheek 's been rather skilfully removed But I see signs of a struggle . - Hey janis , can you ... - Yeah . His good side . ( beth sighs ) ( shutter clicks ) Art : Got footprints . Two sets coming in . One size small , one size giant . Big one does all the heavy lifting ? The smaller one 's a woman , maybe ? Hey , you 're hungry , right ? How could you tell ? Fung 's ? - See you there . - Yeah . ( sighs ) ( mobile ringing ) You 're up early . Dude , you need to talk to alison . - Why , what 's going on ? - ( sighs ) I need to pay my tuition . I 'm changing schools for you guys . If the money 's not in the account today ... I 'm sorry , but your sick german 's gonna have to wait till next semester . Alison will pay , all right ? Don 't worry about that . She wants an expense report . ( scoffs ) I 'll talk to her , okay ? Yeah , well , can you hurry ? 'cause I 'm technically homeless And I just split up with my girlfriend . - Everything else okay ? - Not really . You ever heard the one about the lesbian and the u-haul ? Uh ... Never mind . Forget it . I want answers , beth . I know there 's a shitload you 're not telling us . I 'll know more soon , all right ? All you need to do is travel safe , okay , cosima ? - I 'll see you soon . - Yeah , yeah , yeah , whatever . Okay , see ya . Okay . Art : We used to talk through our personal shit all the time . I got cop problems and a shit relationship . Maybe you remember your divorce . Yeah . I remember that you were there for me when I needed you . I don 't need you yet . Let me just get a handle on it first . What about the pills ? Hmm ? They got a close eye on you . Yeah , I 'm aware I 'm a crappy cop . The thing is , you 're not . You just had a rough couple of months . ( scoffs ) God , what is it that 's got you so twisted up ? Hmm ? Is it just paul ? ( sighs ) It 's my shit . Don 't take it on . ( footsteps approaching ) Hey . ( chuckles ) so what 's up with the mutilated face And modified dick ? ( chuckles ) I 'm sure you 're gonna hazard a guess , ang . That shit is darkly sexual . ( chuckles ) You guys always catch the weird ones . It 's mathematically unfair . So how you doin ' , beth ? I 'm great , angie , thanks . - Should we go ? - Yeah . ( art sighs ) ( sighs ) She 's shaky , dude . She 's fine . ( indistinct chatter ) - I 'll catch up with ya . - Yeah . Look , constable , I only popped round for a drink . The bar at the highcroft is very classy . All the bartenders in their little matador jackets . You were arrested there for solicitation Six months ago , as well . But I was released without charge . Only this time we caught your bay street blow boy , too . Well , now I 'm confused . Is that a sexual or narcotic reference ? Possession , solicitation , public urination , that 's nice . That was a performance piece , And I never should 've been charged . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Raj ! You 're gonna kill somebody here . Thanks , beth . Straight up , I need a favour . With this paul shit I 've been telling you about ... Raj : Yeah . Are you gonna break up with him ? I think he 's cheating on me . Oh . Think I could borrow a little surveillance gear on the dl ? Uh , yeah . Thanks , man . So what 's the deal ? Someone dropped this in your lap ? Yeah , anonymous tip to my work cell . I 'm waiting on a trace . Yeah , between the tattoos and the body mods , I 'll have an id soon . I 'm gonna shake up some sources , See if it 's somebody I know . That cool ? Hardcastle : She making her meetings ? Yes . Masks . - ( knocking on door ) - ( sighs ) Mk ? - Anybody home ? - Mika : In the back . Mika ? Mika : Right here . Beth : This again ? I thought we were meeting in person this time . - Put the mask on . - I 'm not wearing the stupid mask . Why aren 't you here ? You drove your car . I told you always come on foot . You 're not scared enough . You convinced me my boyfriend 's a spy . ( stutters ) is that not enough for you ? Mika : Ooh . You have three minutes . Could you at least take off the mask ? You said face-to-face . ( sighs ) There . It 's a nice face . So , tell me about this body . What did you see ? I saw neolution . So this is the guy , the guy you met online ? Mika : I 'm not stupid . I never met him . I just watched . His name was basspair86 . - So he 's neolution ? - No . Well , yes , but no . He 's just a tadpole . Neos put their ideas in these stupid tadpoles ' heads So they can experiment on them . Did you tell the others about me ? I never reveal a source . That 's why you brought me into this in the first place , isn 't it ? But you told them what they are ? Yeah , they deserve to know . It puts them in danger . You gotta get it . The only reason I 'm alive is because they think I 'm dead . Neos are everywhere . I tracked one into your bed . I tracked one into the police , it might even be your partner . Art 's not a spy . You know what , screw this . No , beth , please , please don 't leave . I don 't have many friends . Well , then we need each other . I 'll do the legwork but go back to these " cheek choppers " . Black female , white male . Where did they kill basspair86 ? - An ambulance . - An ambulance ? It 's getting harder for them to hide . Their secrets squeeze out through these stupid tadpoles So start at the bottom . - Club neolution . - ( watch beeps ) Time 's up . Mika , you ... You can meet us in person . You don 't have to do this alone . ( sighing ) Tracked down the tattoos . Our vic 's name is edward capra . Capra , okay . Yeah , I got an address , I got parents to visit . - What do you got ? - An online handle . Mr capra might go by basspair86 . Tell me something , how the hell do you know that ? Uh , I 'm busy out here , all right ? Tell raj to check the body mod forums . Tell him I said he 's good at that . ( music playing ) Astrid : Can I help you ? Yeah , I 'm looking to have my breasts surgically modified Into like corkscrews . Mmm ... ( smacks lips ) Yeah , and , unfortunately , we 're members only . Beth : Mmm-hmm . ( smacks lips ) detective childs . ( music continues faintly ) Man : ( sighing ) oh , yeah . Yes ! And they 're riding nicely on your hips , too . Mmm-hmm . ( sniffs ) ( breathes deeply ) ( chuckles ) I knew you 'd love this piece . ( mobile ringing ) - Olivier duval . - Astrid : Yeah , it 's astrid . There 's a cop upstairs . I 'm busy . What 's his name ? Her name is childs . ( sighs ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( machine whirring ) ( sighs deeply ) Did you guess that I was a cop , too ? Yeah . Implants , magnets . So she implants magnets in fingers ? She implants lots of things in lots of places . Totally out of the blue , does she ever bifurcate dicks ? That 's an alteration , not an implant . Ah , right . I see the distinction . So , are magnets like a neolution thing ? Attract-repel ? Neolution is just an ethos . Like about creating yourself . Individual evolutionary choice . Beth : It 's also kinda cool . Yeah . - Totally cool . - ( beth chuckles ) Do you know a guy named edward capra , by any chance ? No . No ? This guy here ? - What happened ? - Well , I 'm homicide , So somebody hastened his demise . Anybody cares about this guy , They should get in contact with me . Congratulations . - Alison : ( over mobile ) hello ? - I 'm here , alison . Where are you ? I sent a courier . How do I put bullets in this thing ? You don 't . You wait until I teach you how to use it , okay ? I just wanna blast something right now . Yeah , I know that feeling . - How 's paul ? - We 're great . No , you 're not . I can hear it in your voice . - Ugh , well , we 're fine . - ( knocking on window ) Shit . Is this a flower guy ? Yes , I arranged them myself . His name is ramone . - Ramone ? - Ramone : Yeah . Delivery from mrs hendrix . Oh , you , uh , must be her sister . - Yeah , we 're related , yeah . - Oh . ( groans ) Here you go . Ah , there 's a card in there . Okay . Good-looking family . Hmm , horny little bastard . These are nice , though . - Frosted greens , muted orange . - ( cocks gun ) I can 't stand those garish tropicals everyone 's using . I couldn 't spare too many helpers but ... It 's okay . This little bottle 's the other thing ? - Mmm-hmm . - I really hope it 's not yours . God , no . It 's my daughter 's . Please don 't mix it up with anything . I won 't , I won 't . Okay , you repeat after me . ( exhales ) I promise that I will not gun up Until beth has shown me basic firearm safety . - I promise . - ( gun clicks ) And I promise to put cosima 's tuition and airfare Into her account this afternoon . Yes , fine , fine , But you have to administer the funds from now on . I can 't keep running off to the bank at a moment 's notice . - Thanks , alison . - Toodles . - Toodles . - ( mobile beeps ) - ( keys jangling ) - ( car engine starts ) Olivier . Olivier , just tell paul to take her on a holiday . Olivier : ( over mobile ) the relationship is disintegrating . Paul has neither influence or insight left . Beth needs a new monitor . - There 's no other candidate in place . - Aldous ... She just walked into my club And I can 't tell if it was a coincidence or not . Well , how could you ? It 's police business . I have other levers . - You do ? - Of course . Leave it with me . - ( mobile beeps ) - is there a problem ? ( sighs ) I would say so . One of my subjects seems to have exhumed one of yours . ( sighs ) I beg your pardon ? Beth : Dr leekie . Wow , this is an honour . A detective studying biotechnology . - Yeah , truthfully , I 'm just cramming . - Mmm . You 're wanted , aldous . So I understand that your followers wear A single white contact lens , is that right ? - I wouldn 't call them " followers " . - Right . Well , I have a victim of foul play Who was wearing one white contact lens so ... Do you know an edward capra ? - No , I 'm sorry . - No ? So this guy had some pretty serious body mod going on . Not exactly this crowd , But your " freaky leekies " really ran with the ball , Didn 't they ? Dr aldous : Neolution is an open-source concept . We embrace the fringes , the fiction to our science . Well , your book inspires them to play god , To tinker on themselves in basement labs . ( laughs ) Every scientific discovery in history , including god , Began with " tinkering in the basement . " God was a scientific discovery ? A little joke . We 're all impatient for the future . Excuse me . One more thing . Mr capra had his cheek cut out , post-mortem . Can you think of any reason for that ? No , that 's horrifying . ( sighs ) it certainly is . I 'm evie cho . Hello . And , uh , how are you connected ? I 'm not . Alas , we can 't help you , detective . I 'm so sorry . You must absorb a tremendous amount of pain in your work . - Comes with the territory . - Yes . The paths we choose . That was a leda clone , wasn 't it ? You know , I 've never seen one in person . I 'll steer her away . You look after your end , evie . Woman : Please welcome to the stage , dr aldous leekie . ( crowd applauding ) Hey , I got a text . Where 's art ? Man : Boardroom . Hey , what 's up ? I got called in . I got the trace from your tip . You did ? ( stammers ) that 's crazy . I 've been calling all day . The number was activated and used only once . - A burner . - Okay , so ... Could be random , could be someone you know . Either way , you 're off the case . What ? You serious ? - Beth ... - No , no , no , no . That 's bullshit . That 's my case . They called me , lieutenant . That 's an order . - ( door opens ) - mike , can I see you for a second ? - Yeah . - It 's a thing upstairs . - Right up . - ( sighs ) - See your union rep . - Why ? ( groans ) a piss test . I should 've known . ( sighs deeply ) Art : Xan yip , female , 46 . ( chuckles ) fugitive foreign national . ( groans ) My back hurts from turning over rocks already . Are you even gonna pass ? Yeah , I 'm gonna pass . Sorry , I 'm here to make sure it 's fair . For you . - Hey , beth . - Hey , raj . What 's up ? Got your hard-shell cases . This is the stuff you wanted , right ? Jeez , you really came through for me , man . ( classical music playing ) ( snorting ) ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Paul : Hey . Beth : Hey , yourself . You look nice . Did you have a good day ? No . ( sighs ) Shit . You know , if things are so bad at work , I was thinking I have some weeks banked , You take a leave , and we 'll take a holiday . - A holiday ? - Sure . How about barbados ? How bout we just lock the door and drink and screw for , like , two months ? No , we 're not gonna solve our problems like that . We 're not gonna solve our problems at all . I can 't breed . Yeah , I made it clear I can live without kids . So did I. I made it clear all I really need is a lover who can look me in the eyes . Can you look at me ? Look at me . Can you see me ?

Kiss me . - Kiss me , kiss me , kiss me . - ( inhales sharply ) Kiss me . Just ... - Just ... - Kiss me for real , please ! Stop . ( shudders ) Why are you doing this ? Do you realise how paranoid that sounds ? Yes . ( gasps ) You 're hollow , paul . There 's nothing inside . I filled you in with hunches And all I know for sure is you won 't protect me . You 're right . Just tell me what you want . Do you want this to end ? This is all for you . You say it 's over and it 's over . You end it , you coward ! ( door slams ) ( neighing ) ( knock on door ) ( sighs ) Beth ? I come in peace . Everything all right ? - Hey , maya . - Hi , beth . Can I just watch tv with you guys ? That 's it . Just that . That 's all I need . All right , maya , it 's time for bed . - Maya : Dad ... - Come on now . Come give beth a hug . ( beth chuckles ) - Good night . - Good night . Don 't let the bed buddies bite . Art : Let 's go . ( man speaking indistinctly on tv ) ( tv closes ) Hold me there . What is happening with you ? Look at me . See me . Whatever it is , just say it . Beth . ( mobile vibrating ) ( mobile continues vibrating ) - ( dance music playing ) - beth : Detective childs . Trina : It 's trina . What ? Sorry , who ? Uh , trina . Do you remember me ? One second .

I 'm gonna call you from the car , okay ? They 're going to aaron 's lab . Chinatown is where all the biohackers are . Okay , I 'm close . Why would he let them implant something in his cheek ?

( indistinct chatter ) - Aaron : I know I 'm breaking my word . - ( frank shushes ) Just please , please just get it out . Roxie : Okay then , hop up . Frank : At least he didn 't try to take it out himself like mr capra . Roxie : That 's tampering , and it 's well covered in the contract . Go on . Go under . - When you wake up , it 'll all be gone . - ( aaron gasping ) - Frank : He had to go . - God damn it . Duko : Did you even try to talk him out of it ? Frank : He wouldn 't listen to reason . They 're not gonna be happy about any of this . - Can you see ? Do you need more light ? - It 's good . It 's right there . Duko : Careful .

 Do you know who this belongs to ? Do you ? Answer me ! It 's mine . I don 't think Gerson would agree . Do you know Gerson ? I don 't think she 's met Gerson . Do you know what we do ... to people who try to steal from Gerson ? On the ground ! Let 's go . Fuck . - Let go ! - Oh , being so brave . Go on . I know what we 're gonna do with you . Let her go . Next time you 'll know better , bitch . Let 's go ! A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES CHAPTER 03 CORRIDOR Nair ? Listen to me . You need to be careful . Aline was sent by Councilor Matheus . - So , they 're coming after me . - They all share the same ideas . Increased transparency , an easier Process . If they find one shred of evidence against you ... my vote will count for nothing . I have nothing to hide . I wonder how long they 're gonna make us wait . Until we die from anxiety . Oh , damn . My bad , it 's a close match . Yeah . We 're doing our own test to see who can get it in the pipe . Knock it off before you get us all in trouble . Where 's your competitive spirit ? - Let us try . - It 's our turn . Step behind the line . Watch out for the ... - What ? - The chair . - My turn . - No . Here 's the deal : if Fernando gets it in on the first try , I 'll give him my spot on the Offshore . - Then watch closely , douchebag . - Go on . Watch . - Ow , fuck ! - Suck it ! Nice ! Idiot . Now you have to give me your spot . That 's if you even pass . Think you 're pretty tough , don 't you ? I have great aim , but I 'm not a great person . Watch yourself . Come in , Cássia . Oh , it 's you . The next test just started . May I watch it with you ? - Of course . - Thank you . Look . They were eliminated . Did you see she pissed herself ? What happened ? - Do you think they wash these clothes ? - That 's what you 're worried about ? Hello , candidates . I hope you 're happy with the people in your group . After all , you did choose which candidate to eliminate in the last test , right ? More or less . - What 's the test ? - It 's simple . All you have to do is cross the tunnel as a group . - Ready ? - Let 's go . Sorry , we just have to cross the tunnel ? That 's all ? What 's inside ? An alligator ? Go . You have five minutes . - How long is the tunnel ? - Good luck . Let 's just move forward as a group . Come on , follow me . Guys ... do you hear that hissing noise ? Why did you kill Bruna ? - What did you say ? - I didn 't say anything , Michele . Guys , hold on . Less than a minute in and the chicks are losing it . Guys , listen up . This is just a dark tunnel . That 's all . Let 's stick together . Sorry . If you touch me again , I 'll turn you in . Fucking cheater . Slow and steady , guys . At this rate , we 'll never make it across . I 'll go first . Excuse me . There 's no " other side of the tunnel . " They 're gonna kill us ! What is this test about ? What 's the concept ? We release an odorless gas into the tunnel which has a profound effect on the brain 's occipital lobe . - Hence the hallucinations . - Yes . In order to be worthy of joining us , they have to leave fear and paranoia behind . We have to move faster . - You 're no good , Joana . - You shouldn 't have stolen from Gerson . We need to get across before something bad happens . - You 're no good , Joana . - How can you live with yourself ? How can you sleep at night after what you did ? If you go back , Gerson will kill you , Joana . - His most precious thing . - You 're a murderer . Murderer . How can you sleep at night knowing what you 've done ? You are a horrible person . It won 't change what you did . Let me out of here ! I crossed the tunnel ! I need to get out ! This is a group test , candidate . You only pass if the entire group passes . You 're no good , Joana . You are a horrible person . ... will kill you . His most precious thing . Running away won 't change anything . You 're a murderer ! You are a horrible person . - Joana , where were you ? - Negotiating your surrender , Rafael . - What ? - Come with me . That 's a lie . There 's a traitor in our group . There 's a traitor in the group . There 's a traitor here . Hello , Michele . What 's wrong ? Isn 't this what you came for ? To kill me ? I deserve it . You killed him . You 're no good , Joana . You 're a horrible person . It 's some kind of gas ! Who are you ? What you 're hearing or seeing , it 's the gas ! You 're an embarrassment to your family . - We have to keep moving ! - I don 't think he 's an Álvares . - Shut up ! - You can argue at the other end . Let 's go ! Go ! Come on , Ágata , let 's go ! She 's gonna kill us . She 's gonna kill us . Only one left . Running away won 't change what you 've done . You 're a murderer ! - Come on ! - Keep your hands off me . - Come with me ! - Don 't touch me ! Do you know what we do with traitors around here ? I just did what I had to do ! Rafael , you need to stop breathing the gas . - Murderer . You 're a murderer ! - Murderer . Shut up ! Rafael ... forget what you 're seeing and what you 're hearing , and come with me . Let 's go ! Trust me ! Let 's get out of here . Now , guys ! Come on ! Congratulations . The effects of the hormones in the gas will wear off soon . You will now be directed to the dorms . This way , please . Ágata , it 's over . Come with me . Cássia , I want you to find out everything you can about this candidate , okay ? I 'm not sure about this test . I don 't know if it 's selecting who we need for the Offshore . What about these plants , huh ? Who picked these for you ? Why couldn 't I have picked them myself ? Of course . Your office ... you have no pictures in here . No , I don 't . Not even of Julia , your wife ? No . Do you have any other comments ? This is where you 'll be sleeping . I can 't believe I lost it in there . I swear it won 't happen again . Lucky for us it was you and not Lucas . Or we 'd be gone . What about you ? What did you see ? Nothing . Right . You don 't have to trust me . Just go it alone . They 're making us sleep in the engine room . Because where you slept before was so much better . Ágata , relax . The test is over . - It 's over . - Here . She 's been like this since the test . It 's nothing to worry about . Give her time . The effects will wear off after a good night 's sleep . - No , I think she 's having- - - We 've done this test before . If she passed , she has to stay . But wait ! You 're not going to do anything ? Don 't worry . He 's an Offshore agent . - He knows what he 's doing . - I don 't know . Maybe the gas is still wearing off , but I feel kind of ... I know . It was horrible . Michele , what did you see ? I thought I heard you say something about your brother . Okay . I 'm sorry . I don 't mean to pry or anything . I just want you to know- - - I 'm sorry . - No . All eliminated candidates have been escorted out . Okay . Except one who tried to sneak back through the gate . Really ? That 's funny . Where was Aline going with those questions ? - She 's just trying to throw me off . - Know what I was thinking ? Imagine if they put you , me , Aline , and the Council members in the tunnel . Think we would pass ? We 're not here to discuss hypotheses , okay ? It 's no wonder Aline is intrigued by your personality , you know ? Cássia , I have a Process to run . I don 't have time to joke around or answer Aline 's questions . Of course you passed . Marco was leading your group . Who ? Pretty boy over here ? He totally lost it . You 're telling me Marco didn 't lead you guys through ? It was Joana . And he was the last one out . Almost fucked everyone over . So what ? Maybe it 's because I have a lot going on in my head . - It 's called being profound . - Right . Sorry . Do you think it 'll be worth it ? What ? Passing . Of course . Anything is better than this hellhole . Where do you want your kids to grow up ? Inland ? Or the Offshore ? - You want to have kids ? - Sure I do . Why not ? Those poor kids . No one really knows what it 's like over there . If there 's a lot of green , surrounded by nature . They 're advanced . If they don 't need plants , they won 't have them . The Offshore has a gigantic greenhouse . They harvest everything they plant . When I was younger , I pictured a place in the clouds . I know the greenhouse is for real . My grandma was a second cousin to the Founding Couple . You know a lot of people claim that , right ? She 's the one who started building the underground railroad ! Sure , the tunnel ... No . What do you mean ? It runs between the lake- - Between the dried-up lake and the landfill . Right . I know . It 's run by militia . Oh , yeah ? Is that what you hallucinated about ? No . I didn 't see anything . So , you 're immune to the gas ? Either that or you have nothing in your head to hallucinate about . No fears , no regrets , no guilt ? Impossible . - What about that guy we killed yesterday ? - The one we beat to death . And now they wanna fuck up my house ? The place where I raise my son ? Are they crazy ? Let 's go sort this shit out . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to ... Die ! Die ! Stop , Ágata ! Let her go ! She 's gonna kill us all ! In the middle of the night while we 're sleeping ! - She won 't , Ágata . Trust me ! - She will ! Everything is okay . - No ! - It 's okay . Everything is fine . Trust me . Trust me . It 's okay . Cássia , I 'm already fixing the alarm . No , it went off by accident . I 'll call you back . What are you doing here ? I 'm hungry . Come here . Wash your hands . Wash them like you mean it . That 's it . Dry them quickly . Quick ! Eat with your hands . I 'm eating with my hands , too . Hey ... Augusto . You were waiting for me , weren 't you ? I couldn 't go see you because things are difficult here . Someone has been watching me . I 'm being watched . Do you understand ? Listen to me . I might not be able to see you as often as before . Things have changed around here . Answer me . Do you understand ? I understand . Are you still hungry ? Yes . Do you want my plate ? Okay . I have a gift for you . Here . Here ! Hey ! What 's going on ? Help me . - What ? - I fucked up . You fucked up ... What happened ? Tell me . Do you still work with registrations ? You were never registered ? No . When there 's no one to take care of you , no one registers you either . Well ... it can be done , but it 's not ... it 's not that simple . I mean , it 's not just , " Take this , implant it , and done . " They 're going to kill me , Valéria . Or worse . Come . Come with me . Lie down . I 'm gonna show you how it all goes down . Look at this . This is a piece of liver . The registration is right here . The registration needs to stay in contact with living cells , otherwise it turns off . Now ... are you gonna tell me what 's happening , or are you gonna keep me in the dark ? NO RECORD Flip over on your side . It 's going to be quick and it won 't hurt too much . Just a little . So many want to go through the Process and you 're trying to use it so you can disappear . " Joana " ? The name of the registration 's owner . The poor soul who died . No ! You have to stay and rest for at least a few hours . Thank you , Valéria . - Gerson 's son was killed . - It was that girl . The lonely one . Know what we do to people who steal from Gerson ? There 's a reward . Do you know where she is ? - Didn 't you know her , Valéria ? - No , I don 't know her . - You 're a murderer . - Murderer ! - How long was I- - ? - Was it you ? - What ? - Who killed his son . Gerson 's already set a bounty for the man who killed his son . Or woman . I didn 't mean to get you involved . How could you do that ? He was a child . I won 't tell anyone that you helped me . I will know that I helped you ! Get it ? Now I know who you truly are . It was an accident . Get out . Get out of here ! Right now ! Ágata fell sleep . The gas took a toll on her . Poor thing . Are you feeling better ? You don 't have to talk to me . I just saved your life . But what 's a life , right ? " Thanks , Rafael . " " No problem , Joana . You 're welcome . " I saw a kid . During the test . Then he was here in the corridor . Maybe the gas had a delayed effect on you . I know what I saw . I know what I did . You 're not a bad person , Joana . What do you think you know about me ? I don 't really know ... anything . But I feel it . You saved me in that test . I think that you blackmailed your way into an alliance . But after today , I think we could ... extend that alliance . What do you think ? Joana , I know you won 't turn me in . Especially since I can turn you in , too . Joana ... we may have gotten where we are doing things the wrong way ... but I believe we 're doing the right thing now . In our own way . I don 't know what you did or what you saw in the tunnel . I don 't give a fuck . I don 't wanna know . I know , I feel ... that you 're a good person . You 're the only one who doubts that . Here . Ezequiel ? Stay here . Be quiet . I saw your light was on . May I come in ? Of course . I didn 't realize you were having dinner . Yes , once in a while I get hungry . Did you have company ? Is that your final question or are you just getting started ? Aline ... - let 's put an end to this . - There 's no interrogation . I know very well why you are here and who sent you . The Council . Oh , the Council . I know exactly ... who from the Council sent you . And why . The good thing about our society , the beauty of it ... is that each one of us made it through the Process . You simply check anyone 's ID and their registration to find out exactly who they are . And there 's no room for lies . Or secrets . - But for now , I 'll let you relax . - Thank you . And , please , just one last question . Is it common for anyone to leave the building during the Process ? No . That doesn 't happen . Okay . Good night , Ezequiel . I have to get you out of here right now . Where is it ? Listen ... I meant what I said , okay ? You can never come here again . Never . Go . You should be sleeping . I can 't . Are you worried ? Thinking about stupid stuff . Not that . For a minute , I could see myself on the Offshore . That 's not stupid . And you were there with me . We 're here to pass the Process . - We can 't get distracted . - Yes , of course . - Do you understand ? - Yes . I was gonna say the same thing . Not that I didn 't like it . It was probably just the gas talking . It probably made us a little high . Totally . It was probably the gas . Probably . - Good night . - Good night . What 's up ? Thank you . What 's up , Joana ? How long has it been ? Is it daytime yet ? - This wall wasn 't here before . - Are you sure ? Yes . We came in through here yesterday . Wake up ! Everyone , wake up ! Listen , they blocked the exit . We 're trapped in here . Hey ! Is anybody out there ? Subtitle translation by João Neto

 Peter : Previously on helix ... So what are we looking for ? Fungal toxin that 's ingested . Means it 's likely in the food supply . Whatever this is , it 's hot and it 's on the move . Honey . Kyle : Tracked down a massive hive on the north wall . Samples crawling with mycotoxin . Are the bees carriers ? ( grunts ) Take it . It is my legacy . ( gasps ) ( gasps ) Amy : I 'd say it 's about time we took matters into our own hands . Your actions threaten to destroy everything we 've worked for . Do not be consumed by the doubts and fears of a world we left behind . You might have others fooled , But i know what you are . What am i ? I think alan suspects something . He keeps bringing up ilaria . What is going on here ? Maybe you 're the one who took soren . ( gasps ) ( siren wailing in distance ) Woman : This is the suspect . Dr. Alan farragut , Former head of the cdc 's special pathogens branch And field leader of the rapid response team . He led his team to the arctic to investigate a deadly pathogen that ... Man : Narvik . I know . Then you know that right after the arctic biosystems fiasco , Farragut dropped out of sight . That 's the last image that we have of him , Exiting the headquarters of the ilaria corporation Moments before a bomb went off . A dozen people were killed . Farragut is wanted by the french police , the fbi and europol . But he 's our responsibility . We need your help to bring him in . Why me ? Your background in toxicology and epidemiology make you Uniquely qualified to join this foreign team . Your job is to collect intel So we can make an arrest . Yes , ma 'am . ( panting ) Stay with me , sarah . Okay ? Stay with me . Somebody help ! Help us ! Somebody help ! Help ! ( coughing ) it 's okay . Oh my god , what happened ? I found her on the cannery floor . She 's losing a lot of blood . Help me get her up . Kyle : Can you stop the bleeding ? I can 't even feel the bottom of the wound . Shit ! We need a surgeon ! What happened to her ? Somebody attacked her . You need to leave . Now ! Not leaving her along with you . She has a punctured lung and a lacerated pancreas . Dr. Sommer and i are both qualified medical professionals . We 'll handle it . You 're research doctors . You 're not a doctor at all ! Sutured every wound on this island for the past 50 years , So unless one of you is a thoracic surgeon , you 'll just be in my way . I promise i 'll take care of her . There 's nothing more you can do . ( theme music playing ) Kyle : This place is a nuthouse . We should grab sarah and get the hell out . Coast guards said they can 't come back for another week . Fine , then use the damn sat phone , Get us an airlift back to the mainland . Kyle , we can 't go anywhere until sarah is stable . And if we run before we get containment , This outbreak could spread . Fine , then we should tell these people about the honey Before it turns the entire flock into a bunch of raving maniacs . If we go wide with this , it could create a panic . ( scoffs ) Are we on the same island ? I just got stoned by a bunch of kids ! And someone just stabbed sarah ! We 're so far past panic , It would take the light from panic 100 years to reach us . Okay . You 're right . I 'll talk to michael . I 'll tell him about the mycotoxin in the honey . You go to the orchard , cordon off the infected hive . We need to destroy it properly and then bioseal the remains . If we do our jobs , we could still stop this thing . ( crows cawing ) ( grunts ) ( grunts ) Honey ? You 're saying that this disease And all the pain and suffering is caused by a few Infected bees ? More than a few . And we don 't know if the bees were the source . They could 've picked up the pathogen and carried it back to the hive . Well , how are my people getting sick ? We don 't eat honey or any food outside of our walls . We believe one of your followers May have harvested the honey and shared it with others . Who ? Who would do such a thing ? There 's a man ... He 's here undercover , Pretending to follow your rules . He 's even using a false name . Jerome . Well , many of our followers come here trying to escape their past . We offer them a fresh start , no judgment . Does that include terrorists ? This man is a wanted criminal . Our gates are open . We turn no one away . ( scoffs ) Did you have any of these problems before jerome arrived ? These problems began when you arrived . Doesn 't make you a terrorist , does it ? I 'm curious . Exactly how did you come by this information ? Jerome and i have a ... History . He 's my brother . Your brother ? I wasn 't expecting that . I felt i owed you an explanation . So what do you suggest i do ? Keep him away from the rest of your people . Until you do , no one here is safe . Thank you , peter . You 've done me a great service . And now i owe you . ( door opens ) ( door creaking ) ( groaning ) ( gate closing ) ( grunts ) Brother michael : Hello , jerome . Michael ? Where am i ? The french call it an oubliette . The word literally means " to forget " . You wanna forget me ? Why ? Have i done something to displease you ? It 's time for you to confront your past , jerome . Your true past . For you to be honest about who you are And what you 've done . But my past is my own . You told us to leave it at the gate . Don 't tell it to me . Talk to him . Dr. Farragut seems to think you 're dangerous . He actually knows quite a bit about you . Well , he should ... Since he 's your brother . I really have no idea why he wanted me to confine you , But i mean , it 's fairly obvious that you two have your issues . Maybe you 'll solve them . Maybe you 'll kill each other . I can 't wait to find out which . Peter : You gonna untie me ? Alan : Depends . Wanna tell me why they threw you in here ? I was trying to do my job . To protect his people from the mycosis . And that involved ratting me out ? ( sighing ) Look , i was trying to convince him To work with us . You were the last chip i had to bargain with . Right . Michael and his people Have been working against my team . My team . Not anymore . You know , every time Something goes wrong , i look up and there you are . Arctic biosystems , paris , and now here . Me ? You blew up a building , alan ! You murdered people ! I was trying to save julia . Ha ! Well , you could 've killed her . Since when do you care ? Oh , that 's right ! Since you slept with her . Oh , you selfish , self-centered prick ! I went up to the arctic to get away from her , So you could have your life back ! And what did i get ? Narvik ! I nearly lost everything , And yet somehow , you 're the one who 's suffered ? I lost julia in the arctic . Oh , don 't kid yourself . She 'd been trying to get away from you for years . Not another word about her . Oh , it 's easy to threaten a man when he 's tied up . Now say something . You threw your life away , alan . You 're a murderer and a terrorist . And you 're a second-rate hack Who 's pretending to live my life because he couldn 't make it on his own . ( grunts ) Do you have any idea what it 's like To be the man who could never quite measure up ? Not my fault i was better at everything . That 's not what your wife said . ( both grunting ) Brother michael : I would very much like to know What is going on in my orchard . Is something happening ? Well , our friends in the cdc seem to have figured out How this terrible sickness is transmitted . Through honey . Michael , that 's not possible . We followed the safeguards , took every precaution ... And yet , there 's a contaminated beehive where no hive should be . If that 's following precautions , I 'd hate to see what out of control looks like . We bred the pollen to be aseptic . Even if the bees were cross-pollinating from outside the wall , This shouldn 't be happening . Well , then ... How can you explain it ? Sometimes Nature finds a way . Nature . ( scoffs ) Do you know what this is ? Cerbera odollam . It 's from madagascar . They call it the suicide tree . Its sap contains An alkaloid toxin Which blocks the calcium channels in the heart . Just a single drop , The heart stops completely , And death Is nearly instantaneous . ( grunting ) If nature had its way , you 'd already be dead . But this plant is harmless , because i grafted the poison out of it . On this island , nature does what i tell it to do . Just like you . Fix this . ( julia moaning ) Being dead can 't possibly hurt this much . Ah ! Caleb : Stay still . Julia : Something 's not right . You 're not gonna die on me , are you ? I didn 't think that was possible . I 'm already dying . I know . He told me . Txm-7 . I thought you were ... Immortal , not indestructible . I don 't age , i heal faster than you , But i can 't grow a finger . I 'm not wolverine . Who 's wolverine ? ( laughing ) Ow ! Still . It hurts to laugh . Julia : Ah ! Julia : Ow ! Still . You fought the haunted man . The one that talks to ghosts . His name was hatake . Was ? Is he dead ? I don 't know . Why did you fight ? Is it about why you 're here ? No . Our fight was personal . He was my father . You killed your father ? We had issues . ( laughing ) I have issues with my father too . ( sighs ) Different kind . I never met him . Yeah , well , Maybe that 's for the best . Ow ! ( moaning softly ) Kyle ? Kyle ... You 're awake . Where is everybody ? They were very concerned about you . Especially dr . Sommer . How do you feel ? Like someone just stabbed me . You barely had a pulse . I 've never seen someone recover so quickly After losing so much blood . Yeah , i 've always been a fast healer . Ah ! You have a perforation In your lung and pancreas . Lie back . Sarah : Um ... Was there any Permanent damage ? You 'll have a pretty good scar , But your recovery is remarkable . ( sighing deeply ) good genes , i guess . Clearly . Did you know about the honey ? I just found out from michael . I was coming to tell you . Hmm . The way this works is when you hear things , You tell me immediately , So i don 't get blindsided . If i have to find things out on my won , What do i need you for ? I 'm sorry . It won 't happen again . It 's not the only thing that won 't be happening again . Ah , shit . Hey ! Hey , are you okay ? Jesus . Doesn 't make sense . Symptoms are still presenting . You shouldn 't be dead yet . I 'm not . I 'm just the bait . ( kc and the sunshine band 's i 'm your boogie man playing ) Man : Outsider , die ! You shouldn 't be here . You are not welcome ! Ah ! ( breathing heavily ) ( screaming ) ( grunts ) ( screaming ) ( knocking on door ) Come . Michael , i wanted to apologize . I should have checked the grounds for any rogue hives . I believed the pollen was sterile , But obviously i was wrong . I understand . And i forgive you . I know how difficult it is for you to see The scope of what we 're doing here , But that 's why i need the three of you . We cannot allow things to fall through the cracks . I know . It won 't happen again . Oh , anne ... So strong . And smart . Clearheaded . A good leader . It 's a shame what the years have done to you . I suppose it can 't be helped . Perhaps one day we 'll be able to hold back the ravages of time , but ... Until then ... Until then . I think you knocked a filling loose . Serves you right . Same one you knocked out in high school . Well , you deserve it that time too . I don 't think that was a fair fight . I was hung-over . That your excuse for losing ? You always did have a great left hook . Just like the old man . I 'm nothing like dad . Sorry . ( sighs ) Used to be you and me against that bastard . Now look at us . I don 't know what happened . We grew up . You think we 'll ever figure this out ? What 's to figure ? Michael threw us down here so we could beat the hell out of each other . No . No , i think he put us down here To see if we 'd figure a way out . ( scoffing ) It 's a frigging dungeon , alan . No , look . I put you on my shoulders , you can reach that grate . Who knows if it 's locked ? If not , you can pull me up after . Yeah , you 're right . Okay , hoist me up and ... What ? Come on . Oh , i get it . You don 't trust me . You did just try to knock out my teeth . That means i 'm gonna leave you down here ? No matter what our differences are , We 're family . I would never do that to you . I wanna believe you , but with all we 've been through lately ... Okay , i 'll boost you and then you pull me up after , okay ? You 'd do that ? Yeah , like i said , we 're family . Come on . ( sighs ) Agnes : No signs of an infection or sepsis . Your swelling is already going down . ( sighs ) great . That means i 'll be out of here soon . You shouldn 't be so eager . That recklessness is what got you in trouble in the first place . See , in the real world , there 's this new thing Where we don 't actually blame the victims . A woman in your condition shouldn 't be going anywhere near infectious diseases . What do you mean , in my condition ? You need to take better care of yourself And your baby . Uh , no . No , i 'm not pregnant . I 've delivered nearly a hundred little ones . I think i know when a woman is with child . Is it okay if this just stays between us ? Of course . You haven 't told the father yet . Is it dr . Sommer ? ( chuckles ) kyle ? No . No . He seems to care a great deal for you . No , kyle and i are just colleagues . As for the father , he ... He and i aren 't close anymore . Perhaps it 's just as well . The better to protect your legacy . My legacy ? Children are the only thing that last . Nothing else matters . I 've cared for hundreds of people on this island . Saved many lives . But when i 'm gone , i 'll be nothing more than a picture on a wall . But through our children , we live forever . Trust me ... There 's more to life than living forever . What is this stuff ? Smells like my grandma 's condo is st . Pete . Lavender oil . It 's a natural antidote for bruising . Yeah . I 'm sure i 'll be fine . This island Can be dangerous . You think this is a game ? There were six members of that crew . We 've only found four . That means there 's two homicidal mycotics loose on the island . Maybe more of anyone else ate more of that honey . ( scoffs ) This pathogen is spreading and you 're acting Like a naughty schoolgirl with her first crush . I didn 't know you like to play rough . ( kyle scoffs ) I can play rough too . Julia : Where 'd you learn to cook ? My mother . She said a good meal nourishes the soul . Smart woman . Yeah , she had to be . Did you ever try to find your father ? There 's nothing to find . He died in a narvik outbreak when i was young . I remember , that was nearly , uh ... Thirty years ago . That 's why my mother brought me here . The riots . The outbreaks . She said that " the world " was no longer a fit place to raise a child . " ( chuckles ) Like i said , smart woman . And it 's only gotten worse . Maybe you 'll find a cure . ( laughing ) Not at this rate . By the time i get back , there may not be much of a world left . I hear there 's not much left anyway . I wouldn 't have risked my life for nothing . I 'm trying to save all the remaining immortals before it 's too late . Funny . What 's that ? All it took was a little mortality to make you people human again . You should be sleeping . But you 're awake . Alert . ( clears throat ) I 've been in bed all day . I need to move around . Slow down , you 're not ready yet . I 'll be fine . I really need to get back to the lab And check on my team . At least let me get you cleaned up . You 've still got blood on your face . ( moaning ) Just another moment . No ... It can 't be . Landry . To what do i owe the pleasure ? Amy thought you might need this . Right . She probably just wanted you to check up on me . What does that mean ? You know ... Make sure i wasn 't ... Wasn 't what ? Making any mistakes . With my work . She 's been very concerned about our progress . Amy is the best thing that ever happened to this island . She 's , uh ... She 's a special girl . And lucky to have somebody like you looking after her . Now if you don 't mind , i need to get back to my work . Agnes ! Agnes , where have you been ? We need your help . I 've been taking care of my patient . We have a problem . The sickness , it 's , in the bees . The honey 's infected , we have to do something . Find anne . Deal with it . Did you hear what i said ? We have bigger concerns than a few bees . The cdc doctor is a silver eye . No , that 's not possible . You 're right , amy . It 's not . ( alan grunting ) okay . Bring me forward . ( grunts ) come on , hurry up ! The human spine is not designed to carry this much weight on the same back ! Almost ... ( grunts ) Come on . ( grunts ) I got it ! Help me get wedged in here . ( grunting ) ( grunting ) ( breathing heavily ) ( grunts ) come on ! Oh , god ! You know , the only reason i 'm in this mess , Is i tried to save you in the arctic . Wha ... What are you talking about ? Just get me out of this hole . Spent most of my life trying to save you from yourself . But it is way too late . Alan , we had a deal . I boost you up , you 'd have never come back for me . No , no , no , come on ! That 's not true , i 'd never do that to you ! You 're my brother ! You 're no brother . The shortcuts , the backroom deals , the lies ? You know who that sounds like ? You bastard . Our father . Come on , just get me out of this hole ! You ready to tell the truth ? About what ? Narvik , in porto rico ? An adolescent psychopath , the scythe , Escaping in the arctic ? The mistakes in paris ? How long have you been working for ilaria ? ( stammers ) what ? Look , that 's ridiculous ! I heard you , peter . You called them from the roof . You always took the easy way out , Never wanted to work for anything . What did they offer you ? Money ? A seat on the board ? Jesus . You didn 't get that much from them , did you ? You sold your soul , You disloyal son of a bitch . And for nothing . Hey . Hey , you don 't know what you 're talking about , okay ? Just get me out of this hole . You dug this hole yourself . It 's where you belong . No , no , no , no ! Alan ! Alan , don 't leave me here ! Alan ! ( gasping ) I just wanted to check your temperature . Am i okay ? You 're fine . Better than that . You almost look as healthy as The day when you landed . You mean right before you clipped me ? I already apologized for that . No , you didn 't . But i forgive you . What about your father ? Did you think about forgiving him ? That wasn 't really an option . But i think in the end the sword was some sort of apology . He called it his legacy . May i ? Do you know what it says ? My father never taught me how to read japanese . His last gift ... I have no idea what it means . You get some sleep . Landry : Here 's the last of the honey , just like you asked . I gave the rest to your cdc friend . He 's not my friend . You are . And you did a very good job . This jar Is going to get me off this island . And you , landry ... You got it for me . ( sighs ) Caleb ? Oh , no , no . No , no , no . ( grunts ) Caleb ! ( echoing ) caleb ! Ow ! Damn it ! You don 't look very comfortable with that equipment . Long day . Do you need something ? I 'm looking for dr . Jordan , have you seen her ? She 's taking samples . This late at night ? Ah , you know hot zone . All business all the time . She doesn 't really have an off switch , does she ? Yeah . If you see her before i do , Tell her i need to talk to her . It 's important . Wait . You can 't go . Excuse me ? Well , dr . Jordan said you might help us . Not before i talk to her . Well , then settle something for me . Arctic biosystems . What ? There are rumors . Well , she was there , so you can ask her . What about paris ? Was she there too ? I figure i oughta know who i 'm working with . Sarah help you blow up that building ? Who are you ? What are you really doing here ? I 'm investigating a pathogen . How about you ? Who do you work for ? Tell me ! You work for ilaria , don 't you ? ( gasping ) i don 't ... Tell me ! Who do you work for ? ( grunts ) You 're making a huge mistake , dr . Sommer . ( jazzy music playing ) I don 't know how we reached this point . Illness , disobedience ... Contempt for our rules ... I 'm failing my people . There 's some good news . The cdc doctor 's recovering . Brother michael : You said she was going to make it . She shouldn 't have . I 'd say it 's a miracle if i believed in that sort of thing , But you and i both know better . Do we ? She 's not the first person i 've seen who heals like that . I 'd say she 's just like you . There 's no one like me . You lied to us . Oh , agnes . Of course i didn 't . You told us you were the only one . That there were no others . But i saw her eyes . Silver , like yours . That 's impossible . She wasn 't there . Wasn 't where ? ( sighing ) You 've always known there were others , haven 't you ? Oh , agnes ... Please , tell me the truth . Are there other immortals ? Have you been keeping this from us ? Could you have made me like you ? Agnes ... Agnes . You know i love you . More than every face on that wall . Ever since you were ... Well , a small child , You were different . You 're smarter , you 're more self-possessed , More driven . Of all my daughters , You 've always been my favorite . But this lack of trust , this doubt , it 's ... It 's like a virus . And we will lose everything we 've worked for , Everything i 've built for the past five hundred years . I just wanna be with you forever . Oh , i know . ( gasps )

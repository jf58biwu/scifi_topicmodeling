 by following program presents theories about in the store called and that is shrouded in mystery it contains archival footage reenactments and dramatizations which invite you the viewer to draw your own conclusions people restructuring one hundred miles north of las vegas may look like any other patch of desert but it 's what the valley 's concealer military facilities so secret it is off limits to all but those with the highest security clearances known as area fifty one is one of the most mysterious places on the face of the earth they care about the desert george lucas envious here things out there that are literally for decades there has been a coordinated strategy among several federal agencies to deceive about what the military is doing here until recently the government even denied the existence of a basement area fifty one went to the people dot people 's representatives today pieces in the face of the government site area fifty one has become part of that fantastical routed truck this is exactly what to do it 's a u _ f _ o _ crash bandicoot success first-hand accounts of the activities around and within the police secrecy but in nineteen eighty nine one man came for inside area fifty one had an absolute classic flying saucer so like something out of the cartoon are flying saucers being tested police the government 's veil of secrecy in southern nevada there is a five hundred seventy five expensive heavily guarded land and restricted air space the pilots call but most people refer to it has an area fifty one the designation of receipt from the atomic energy commission in nineteen fifty-eight forty two-year-old german-born your morning maintains a website dedicated to exploring this mysterious region and makes regular scouting trips to explore hero visits the favors lobo little fairy a fifty one radio we see the warning signs of both size of the road here up on the hill behind the this uh ... security vehicles was two security guards with binoculars and polio it was about the watching us right confirming nineteen fifties numerous unidentified flying object have been spotted in the skies above s battleship the locals on the stand it 's about such unexplained phenomenon loses off after the sky and we stop talking costs and watched it didn 't he was doing six flags like laughs up how it was it was pretty crazy whatever is happening within the area fifty one the government is committed to keep in mexico authorized to shoot you if they did there is no law enforcement the world that could go between a rock area fifty one no access system trillion in nineteen eighty nine two year old resident lost i guess main problems are claims to have pierced the veil of secrecy surrounding these flights united states craft we wouldn 't be going back we 're trying to find out how their bills that we have built up and second of all these stories leaves thousands of people to believe that something called a woman and in the nevada desert bob saw our commercially poplar disclaims tour policies here 's one sources they began to draw fans from around the world there who is on stands by his story convinced this was an extraterrestrial craft right there are five well the equipment and it works but it was in technology and then doesn 't exist even today it on ha spring nineteen eighty nine bob lazar meets with george now a reporter for las vegas t _ v _ station killing us he 's on the claims to have secrets he can no longer this was really taken a toll on me i mean i was exhausted details map that he was hired by the federal government to work on and peeling and spacecraft at area fifty one would require a died about six and he insists that the authorities will do anything to stop him from revealing what he knows there was a guy in the car with them thought it was some government guide ran away reality you saw it tells the reporters he wants to protect yourself from reprisals by going public which was amazing nevertheless he appears in silhouette to conceal his identity so what you 're saying is that we can produce the first interview it was really justice state what happened what was going on here and in case i suddenly disappeared all it would do is prove that what i was saying was true short of time here loves our story begins in nineteen eighty eight wind he says his background in physics and electronics lens on the job interview with top government contractor edgerton commercials and in grief p _ g _ and g _ i was told that they were sent opening available from uh ... to renew it 's not a field propulsion system that i would be working in a remote area it also agreed to it 's exactly what i want to in december nineteen eighty eight on his first day of work lazar claims to have met a man named dennis mariani at the e _ g _ c _ g _ special projects office mccarran international airport in las vegas dennis ryan is kind of a military looking guy it always looks to me i am very hard looking i don 't think the guy ever smiled mary on the issue aboard a private life declines than one hundred miles isolated military base in the nevada desert fifty immediately after landing marian e subjects will start to a rigorous security briefing and hasn 't signed the secrecy you basically signed away a lot of i believe it was called the ten ten agreement ten thousand dollar fine tenure presence and for defaulting any of the information according to laws are he agrees to conditions he will later regret even gives up his right to a trial if he ever reveals anything about working at area fifty one doctor lazar signs the document he invariably board a bus with black dublin the bus leaves area fifty one and drives i 'm guessing ten to fifteen miles south on a dirt road it was kind of exciting than that but if it 's we 're leaving area fifty one in the bus with windows that i can 't let out of this must be release eager and so i was gas in it the boss finally stops and installation called the best for ur now really explains that the site is a series of hidden hangers built into the landscape it 's extremely well camelot here 's a link bizarre will have a graphic artist create detailed renderings based on his own drawings of what he claims he saw estore their hangar doors divers and texture and standing back maybe three or four hundred feet do you really can 't see him at all it pretty much just looks like a continuation of the mountain marielitos art inside the tank guard facility there was very much uh ... oppressive military atmosphere there was always somebody there toughie keeping our eye on virtually robots they had no hoche matt to imply that they were robots but do you have a acted like robots bizarre says he has issued a security back authorizes his clearance through the u _ s _ department of naval intelligence meri on even leads him to a secure briefing room on the desk is a stack of blue falters there 's always allowed to review these files looking through some of the information he gave direct references to flying saucer to end and extraterrestrial vehicle i pretty much discount that and just kept going out bandai i thought well boy this must be part of some security measure going to be a part of all so big is psychological test of some sort so i glance there everything and now digestive worker when mariani takes him back to the home lazar claims his confronted with an incredible sight we walked into was extremely large and they had an absolute flying saucers so like something out of a cartoon in our science fiction it was sitting outside on spelling on the ground i went up in raise my hand to touch tonight on the ground immediately disciplined for that was arson was that the vehicle is an experimental aircraft designed to resemble something from outer space you know why it 's got a flying saucer shaped this explains why so many people see flying saucers buzzword trying to make an aircraft that that way so and still nothing really hit my mind as far as being the only an error many many thanks alisoft says he will finds is that assumption when his job duties are explained game of what we 're doing here is to see if we can 't duplicate any of this material with substances found on earth what do you mean substances found on earth then it began to validate some of what i have read that this was in fact an alien craft has determines the saucer lazar becomes convinced that it is in fact off extra-terrestrial was obviously made for something smaller ideally about half the high men who have been a problem walking around in there everything is around it curved radius to it it looks like the entire thing was an objection malt makeup made at a plastic or wax he says he 's been told that the vehicles propulsion system allows the pilot to traverse great distances instantaneously by manipulating time and space if you have a machine in the country gravity that makes force fields a reality that makes time travel possible all the stuff you read about in science fiction becomes possible if you can manipulate was already is below one are the possibilities until now he 's considered the whole idea flying saucers to bring us up to six it actually has left me pretty much confused led to a lot of sleepless nights for a long time everything new affiliate december nineteen eighty eight eager according to bob lazaro he 's employed at the top secret military installation in the nevada desert area fifty one the las vegas residences heater he asserts to study in the daily inspections it honor was on a claims there are at least nine such craft concealed within area fifty one are all on hangers and some were not completely assembled the sport model the sleek one the one that i was allowed in at that one time was the only one i ever winters ago contact with songs main responsibility used to determine what the power to the envelope this was such an advanced machine that we were looking at from the fuel to the way it was handled to the energy to put that puts out there was big he was completely alien in every way only nicknames once shipped the sport model and claims that makes several low altitude test lights in early nineteen eighty nine blues or says his supervisor dennis memory on it invites him to observe one of them soon draft listed off the ground silent with a slight glow on the bottoms which i assume was their corona discharge kinda like a scene elmo 's fire from high-voltage mixed a little hissing sound listed off the ground and moved over to the left into the right and sat down and to me that was uh ... absolutely empresa throughout his time at area fifty one lazar claims is employers keep him working irregular hours finally went out when i was called out there i could get a call at nine o 'clock at night actually i got a call once at eleven thirty at night mccarren airport by twelve fifteen i did tell your wife here and they do get a column okay i gotta go what is it so it 's my job i don 't know if and when we come back until tomorrow women by this point was ourselves he worked at area fifty one for four months and felt he could no longer abide by his confidentiality agreement at sundown on wednesday march twenty second nineteen eighty nine bazaar and his wife and three frames drive to the edge of area fifty one to wants to testify all the saucer tobacco 's typically only tested on a wednesday night because it was the middle of the week because it was very little travel on the adjacent highways to the test site barbecue the group notices rising behind a mountain pass in the distance became towards us very fast and made abrupt ninety degree turn house yeah higher energy levels with best is at they close full-body god scholars find all-stars or the object of graphic maneuvers physician nothing can can make a and ninety degree turn moving it hundreds of that 's what an impression on everyone 's mind the alien ship harbors for a few more moments before it disappears behind the mountains the following wednesday night was on his group returned to the same spot in the desert but since we got away with the first time we wanted to go back and now actually get pictures of the craft guest are ignited system while politely one week later they make a third night time for a to area fifty one this time however they 've pushed their luck too far the security guys had found us anette pitch black out there and they turned the lights on in their shoes system army of people out there they hit it was quite incredible beyond court struck down ideas and take their names before releasing as they leave blues artist friends are even county sheriff 's deputy holds them for questioning the next day has our science dennis mariani an area fifty one security agents one of the first things they said was you know we trust you with this information we didn 't mean intend for you to tell everyone you know about it accident rate guy tells an m _ - sixteen directly and my face and uh ... you know wanted to impress upon me how serious they were about it according to a song he is released at his employment at area fifty one from then on he says he becomes the victim of a relentless kemp and intimidation driving down charleston boulevard and las vegas as i came to the freeway hung around there was a car they didn 't try and get a law inside hurt by gunshot panic on my attention there was a guy in the car with a gun i went straight one-off fee and and stopped amader i was really just paralyzed in the car i was holding the steering wheel and i thought he was coming up alongside i mean there 's just nothing i can do it is at this point bella 's are decides to take his story to the public uh ... in an interview with kato latest t _ v _ reporter george net will always remain in nineteen eighty nine we interviewed here since the last one was like a chocolate decided to go on the air and then candace basically saying some of the stuff that i have seen that 's right after the interview might get a call from dennis marriott and homes and he said he had any idea what we 're going to do to you now and i said now what and he hung up the phone six months later liz or agrees to another interview with kalia stevie edward this time he reveals his identity on the a _ n _ c _ goes back to where it was going afterwards for the he appears on numerous other television and radio show most and even creates a video about his experience is that it was one that is partial views of the nine different this time it is forever but i wanted to have much greater detail years ago i thought i 'd never hear myself saying this would be able to explain what 's going on who i worked with where things were and just pretty much got her on the record they led me to believe it was uh ... feels good to use force if he did well a lot of attention to syria and to him in secret who picked up nationally by other media and they hope to step which the whole apologies area fifty one of the national consciousness people from across the country flocked to the nevada desert hoping to glimpse the mysterious lights oven alien spacecraft i 've watched it last with my niece unlike for twenty minutes do you really really strange maneuvers final there stranger toledo 's on out here it was actually the second time when his autograph when i got to enter and in november nineteen eighty nine bob lazaro makes an astonishing claim on the las vegas television news program he says that he would gone alien spacecraft a super secret military bases called area fifty one was or is not the first to describe extraordinary events and to lead the government denies even exists rumors about u _ f _ o _ sightings in the nevada desert had been hurt for decades paul lazar is the first to maintain that he had actually worked on feeling and technology he seems to have little reason to live i don 't know anything about aliens er of directions are crop circles or any of that but i do know this craft came from someone else thought looked like he could have been what he said which was sort of your shakespeare high-tech research group uh ... materials that were in use completely alien to us for it and he had seen to be your radiating since the connection some opt out three almost all u _ f _ o _ stories to usually tell about five seconds of the personal business but it was uh ... interesting it was all of the really wasn 't a compelling li twelve a little stories world of you a false sense is already comes and overnight sensation remain bob 's coming out so to speak just lit a fire under every u _ f _ o _ mentoring introducing us in the world you know busloads of people coming in there at the age of area fifty one the town of rachel nevada becomes the jumping off spot for the curious rachel constriction here a little community absolutely nowhere really became the center of the universe people interested in the area fifty one everybody in the country in the world breakdown of about one corporate it 'll cost some of the only ones who make the argument just to watch the desert para aviation institute including a group of amateur planes offers scalding interceptors are also intrigued by liz our story jim good call is a senior member of the interceptors and since nineteen eighty seven on regular sky watcher at area fifty one five sessions have been classified aircraft program visit first glimpse of something you 've never seen what the public has never seen that 's what you 're saying about going out in the desert and you might be the first person to go to get a high-quality image while some trivial the mysterious lights and scott to extraterrestrial visitors bribed opted wearying moderate here the interceptors maintained area fifty one is really a top secret testing facility for u _ s _ military aircraft they point to hard facts and photographic evidence to make their case this particular death appeared to be in excellent condition any consultant something including goodall ticking time bomb was our story credible technology person on the hard workers now the u _ s _ on them badly but those are because mothers are tolley believable story in his liberals are there goal is persuaded in part i what appears to be solid evidence douglas ordeal worked for the military and yearly earnings statement from nineteen eighty eight to nineteen eighty nine according to listen his w _ - two tax form was issued by the quote department of naval intelligence there is however no such known department of government in nineteen ninety during operation desert shield goodall is on active duty in washington d _ c _ with the minnesota air national guard he decides to check on the validity of the czars w _ - two form and goes to the navy 's investigative office in the pentagon i went into the department of navy investigation in the pentagon alleged verification where this location successive flights the navy officer said just a minute and made a phone call message the other edna would like to see it dealers this edibles office cases sergeant if you ever come in this message and it was just something like this alleged court-martialed don 't get out of my office and area there are no go his deputy was phony why did this admiral the biggest sensitive bizarre supporters claim that the so-called department of naval intelligence in keeping with the secrecy of area fifty one is a covert organization such its existence has been kept from the general public and even the u _ s _ congress disc itself despite the support of people like to know critics believe that bob was off is a separate regional hope exams in particular they cite the absence of any evidence to corroborate his story talks about what kind of u _ f _ o _ seaside side so four three uh ... you know what topic you react to that i 'll just try to think about for what he tells us that that we can verify it ninety-seven found inside skeptics scrutinized by the claims made by the song jeewa fit shortlisted for the all eyes according to his own statements in this one work week fewer than two hypotheses aircraft on things ah ... flag falsehoods so that 's pretty amazing discovery for the first world stand friedman a physicist educated at the university of chicago jacksonville is ours educational he supposedly had a masters in physics from m _ i _ t _ yet another one of electronics from cal tech okay uncheck m _ i _ t _ i _ never heard of unchecked caltech they never heard of them i tried to slice turned out he graduated thirty percent school class moreover government contractor he gene gene with rulers are claims to have interviewed for the area fifty one job says it has no record bob lazaro at all right away have a problem with the guy who hasn 't got back from the doesn 't match up to uh ... what claims in can demonstrate that he worked where he says he worked soul while you may not reject his claims out of hand you 've got a look at them with more suspicion period garnered a single everybody 's sounds very good comes across very well people who want to believe casoulos out while some dismissed melissa araza from others believe there was a more sinister motives to his behavior that he 's an agent of the government tasked with perpetuating disinformation about area fifty one wanted to question whether store was sure he was rescuers seriously disinformation agent unwilling there with those who need believed that he had been in some way blames treated draw muscles are supporters the u _ s _ government silence speaks volumes he hadn 't been involved with these people these agents are following better ended bob was ours career as a spokesperson for u _ f _ o _ ' s reverse engineering propulsion systems no one ever did that some conspiracy buffs believe that the u _ s _ government actually encourage those are storing band the mists of u _ f _ o _ sightings it 's an attempt they say to distract the public from what was really happening inside area fifty one there seem to be a good streets of the theory that they were generating a lot of new ways to disguise their real simple it 's with advanced aircraft was or was this is the most intense piece of illicit delivery better lately for jurors flying saucer in the early nineteen nineties after bob was all goes public with a sensational claim that there are dealing spacecraft inside area fifty one be isolated high security base becomes a magnet for tourists they were prostores going out there that pretty much data that voted on the map securities intensified to keep the jury is out but some say that the government actually uses lazar strong to its advantage in that case is somebody actually saw just float and saw some if they want supposed to see if they talk about it they 're just dealt with by the public as another you afford not to receive your whole flying even though i witness reports and photographs of the area fifty one are widely circulated on the internet government officials continued to deny at the base even exists by going out and having a good year blip on the parking lot in san antonio resemblance you 're doing well this one and kill someone says yes this is area fifty one doesn 't exist and that 's our government in nineteen ninety-five the installations borders are greatly expanded affectively prohibiting outsiders from even seeing the base designer it says that we will shoot you if you trespass and hear how well why is that what 's the reason for it american taxpayer estimados after flying out i helped pay for between two peoples have passed the bill swimming over public one over here at the photograph can 't blame the government for one ticket sales what 's going on there but you can 't let the public for one wrestler there are some who say they know exactly what 's been happening at area fifty one men who work there and can proofread they solve much that the government didn 't want the public to know about but none of it they say was from outer space it on our supposedly extraterrestrial subsidies happened over there nothing about that it just read about said they didn 't have and that there when i was our i was all over the place frank murray flute toxic a twelve spy plane at area fifty one he says the based played a vital role in u _ s _ military research and development during the cold war this release that started at about fifty four when blockaded the place to testing developed here to work place diversified in the early nineteen sixties the eight twelve was developed to replace the you tube decommissioned supersonic capable of reaching speeds in excess of months i 'm cruising altitudes over ninety thousand feet frank murray and others testa di twelve at area fifty one we flew over the says to the airport there was nothing to do murray and former radar operator tv barnes can talk about their experiences not because the top-secret projects were declassified in the nineteen nineties bones does acknowledge that he had limited access to the base servos something going on but we did nothing herder burial placed into the missile pulled the plug curtains they have the margin would stay in there disregard ordered was required for whatever they were doing outdoors too for them in the scientific area fifty one the intense secrecy permeated every aspect of their professional lives and even extended to their own families tell them nothing going to start classified projects kept us they never did know until the whole thing was over both marie in barnes say based on no italy in space craft during their time at area fifty but they do to deserve their college serving their country in the program so secret most americans never knew their heroism local conflicts and i do not recall ever hear test pilot hesitated to bring up there if you give us your scientific data they 're still trying to after bones in the reflects other servicemen tested newer like the f _ one seventeen stealth bomber in the late nineteen seventies some state display colder than the real source of many u _ f _ o _ sightings at area fifty one was an easy as one seventeen it looks like a slice of this if f _ one seventeen fight s sparked rumors of an alien spacecraft for the nevada desert that may have been just fine with military authorities why give it away by saying look there 's another military case going on and high altitude aircraft much better test missiles just being so much you what military scientists elephant area fifty the years since the f _ one seventeen in the ten spokesman area fifty one businessman but it is evident dot the basis too reactors drive-bys out twenty five thousand feet long two or three times bigger than what i was there so i know they 're building systems in the present condition of the ways and means technology justice system where they have to jim goodall says he wants pose that very question to ben rich analyses former vice president of the lockheed corporation this is jim we have things out in the desert better fifty here 's another one income if using it on star trek star wars whatever science-fiction movie you 've seen we 've been there seeking to expand upon that that 's it despite efforts to keep a tightly and on the activities that area fifty one officials are forced to publicly acknowledged the existence of the base for the first time one of lawsuit is filed in nineteen ninety-four against the government allegations that hazardous chemicals had been improperly burned at the site leads critics to charge that the veil of secrecy is endangering the public safety the whole existence of the toxic waste dump in the area fifty one days toxicity of excessive secrecy of the dangers of secrecy secrecy any powerful grossly unfair useful stuff is also a very dangerous until nineteen ninety four the u _ s _ government refuse to acknowledge the existence posits a super secret base known as area fifty one but in august of last year a lawsuit brought by former employees of the secret air base forces the department of defense to change this policy range that workers have been ordered to me learned toxic byproducts of the stealth fighter program in open pits at the base causing them serious illnesses and in some cases when they went to court to government used every measure its disposal too shut down the whole story government attorneys argue that publicly revealing any information about the case were threatened national security but critics believe the security measures had gone too far here 's a situation that has nothing to write what you do you say with bomb secrecy with black project aircraft and so forth not only is the government not taken responsibility they 've basically disc wash the case it will not release any information about what 's going on there within a year the government affectively stalls the suit but the case does pressure the pentagon 's to state that it in fact hasn 't operating facility near groom lake finally acknowledging the existence of area fifty one religious force their hand there was a point at which the yes we acknowledge that there is absolutely he really was anymore than that but they at least there was a big change from not even technology was there those pressing to learn the truth about area fifty one begin to ask more questions among them how does the government managed to pay for a non-existent base for nearly four decades the so-called black budget black budget is what 's used to fund thanks white area fifty water dreamland you don 't want to repeal be specific details of what today dot if you spent a billion of a billion dollars in our program stay on if it was a white robe and you should be a people jumping all over two black programs no one else area fifty one as decent this is the villager decision making and there was a lot of concerned that agency proceeded become excessive fit not only do the people dot net people 's representatives student and the chance for abuses very great hahaha bottom line activists like you 're going to regard themselves as public watchdogs determined to limit the potential for such abuse we tried to accomplish it was just kidding the policy somewhat onto the scene not abusing this secrecy a new claims that his quest to keep the government honest has led to a series of confrontations in february of two thousand three onto reported on his website but the government was using illegal tracking sensors on public land around the military base four months later on new claims he received a threatening phone call from the f _ b _ i _ and that made it very trivial said he was very serious that that things would happen to me is a one-stop but pieces he refuses to give up monitoring the activities at area fifty one bob lazar stands by his tantalizing stories but the government is fighting alien spacecraft at area fifty one we can prove things one way or the other improve what he says he stopped by can 't really see it mazone asserts that the government has gone to great lengths too cautious story and discretion including erasing his name from all of his past employment and academic records there was a concerted effort to eliminate main paperwork wise eliminate my background in and everything else i did menendez begins to sound like williams not conspiracy moment maybe things really are like that but i don 't know who pulls the strings i don 't know even wrote my paycheck manzoor insists that he 's still working to provide proof of his claims in there is something i 'm going to personal i have to pull it in there if i have resigned no offense or bus and i can 't wait difference at all lazar has yet to produce such verification the history channel submitted a request to the air force for an interview regarding area fifty one but the request was denied the air force maintains that all operations there are classified every year since the nineteen ninety-four lawsuit the president of the united states has renewed area fifty one pst top-secret status making it inevitable but the criticism and speculation certainly there are things there have to be kept secret blackouts workplace trying so assistance the questions remain dose area fifty one represent the cutting edge of aviation engineering is the source of its most innovative technology other worldly seniors for will find that something so two weeks freezing in the concentrates in there you know it 's the age-old question we all want to know where we came from and what we 're doing here you know some people do this almost as a religion if there is another lifeform out there running around it 's probably been out here longer than we are area fifty one has answers to some of those questions the preceding program presented series about in the store called that a shrouded in mystery it contained archival footage reenactments and dramatizations which invite he will do the work to draw your own conclusions episode of the revolution contributors to france was john negative shearson french going the

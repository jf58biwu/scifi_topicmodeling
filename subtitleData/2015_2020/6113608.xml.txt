 He found me . They know what we 've done . They don 't like it . Oh shit . Oh fuck ! This is it , Harper . The rest is down to you . Finish it . Why do I follow him ... Fallon . Was it a backlash to my catholic schooling ? The morbidity of faith ? Or maybe I just wanted to make something good , for once ? My pact with the Devil . Why are you here ? In film class ? I want to make ... films ? You wanna make the best film ever made . You 're in theology and control engineering . I study computer science . So , why are you in film class ? Can a work of art be so precise in design and execution .. that it can inspire the viewer to see God ? How do you mean ' God ' ? Imagine you 're a medieval pilgrim . Sleeping in the gutter , hallucinating due to malnutrition . At the end of your journey , you gaze up see sunlight reflected through the glass of the Sainte-Chapelle windows . You think it was chance , these designs . You think they were accidents of the imagination . No , there 's technique , maths , geometry . Back then , mixing science and religion could get you killed . These guys , they knew more than they could show . In the 1400 's a leather trader , Karim Nisbah , spent 12 days in the desert . His camel died , the sun burned his red face , but after dragging himself home all he could say to his wife was 'I 've seen God ' . In 1937 , a german marine scientist was hypnotized by this wave of bioluminescence on Lake Karachay . His first words upon revival ? 'I 've seen God ' . And the connection is ? Hypno-induced temporal lobe epilepsy . And there 's a direct link between the optical nerve and the region of the brain responsible for religious devotion . You 're saying images can induce visions of God ? That 's why I joined your film class . I want you to document the experiment . But we know that white noise and binaural beat stimulate the brain . And the visual cortex responds to symmetry . Some patterns work better than others so we altered them using various parameters : scale , color , position . Which worked best ? Well , we tested them , one at a time , measuring the results on the EEG . Are you recording ? Hundreds of people work on this . Across the globe . It 's called Haynault 's pattern theory . They 're looking for a perfect image ? It could take forever to find . That 's what you do ? No . I work for Stratton , a tech firm . We build HIDs ; mice , keyboards ... and this prototype . It scans brain activity . I do software for this thing , and last month ... this happened . It gave me an idea ; if the scanner could give feedback on the standard binaural switch , what could it do for pattern theory ? It is a simple script : is X stimulated ? If no , deviate . If yes , mirror and split . Repeat . No ? deviate . Yes : mirror and split . Mirror and split , mirror and split . Can you control it , the patterns and the ... ? No , it feeds from the subconscious . So you 're testing it on yourself ? Incredible . That 's not all , check the readout you get when you watch this thing back . Shit . You found it . Haynault 's pattern . And so the work began . Ellen White , founder of the Seventh-Day Adventists suffered brain injury at age 9 , had frequent seizures . Spoke directly with God . She was epileptic . So was Dostoyevsky . Do you know what he called it ? The ecstatic aura . You 're saying the entire history of religious prophecies is linked to brain malfunction ? Ten thousand years of fanatical belief . God isn 't a bearded man sat in the clouds , or a four armed elephant ? It is a bug . A glitch . A neurological construct . We worked through the night ... longer hours . Fallon never slept . Fallon ? Have you told anyone ? About the experiment . What ? - I was followed , last night . And then again this morning . By who , the police ? - The Church . You think they 'd like it ? Wouldn 't fucking like it . Wouldn 't like what ? - If we found it . Found what ? The shortcut to God . At first I thought it was a joke . We named his apparitions the religious authorities , but I didn 't believe him . It couldn 't be true . Perhaps you should cut the self-testing ? You could do serious damage . Migraines , seizures , hallucinations . Who else is there ? No . - It 's perfectly safe . Says the paranoid schizophrenic . I 'm not paranoid . Prove it . - I can 't ... But you can . So the experiment took a turn . It didn 't take long to finish the sequence . Join the dots . We named it the Brain Hack . But there was still one problem ... Dammit ! - What ? It happened again . Some kind of reflex , a safety catch . Look . The Brain Hack starts at 4 : 22 , at 4 : 28 the velocity increases . It 's working , but then ~ But then ? Three seconds in , a kind of defense mechanism . Maybe the brain is trying to tell us something . How would you like to be lobotomized ? It 's just the pre-frontal lobe , I could scoop it right out . Then Fallon disappeared . Two days . No word , no warning . What if the visions were real ? If you open the door to God , maybe you let the Devil in too ? Hello ? Well ? - Sit down . You 're not gonna need that . Now we found a pattern that will work every time . Like Haynault predicted ? A universal method of using . And the defense mechanism ? We know how to beat it . What are you doing ? ! Fallon ! ... Shit . No ... no ! That 's right , let the adrenaline come . Fear is how you beat the defense mechanism . Flooding the cerebellum with fear . If you don 't want to see the results , look away now . Well ? Did you see anything ? Tell me . Nothing ? I don 't understand . It doesn 't work , Fallon . But the reaction was incredible ! You should 've seen it . Seen what , God ? Fuck you . It took 20 minutes . But then it happened . The poet Valery once wrote : " The universe is built on a plan , the profound symmetry of which is somehow present in the inner structure of our intellect . " He was right . And it 's beautiful . Fallon ? Fallon ! He found me . This is it , Harper . The rest is down to you . Finish it . Are we doing the right thing ? What do you mean ? We could be ... fucking our brains . No . The brain evolved to do this , it 's a natural function . A natural function ? - Yeah . It 's just ... most people never get that . Modern life , how it is . We 're not touching the hardware . Just hacking the software . Giving it a cheat code for the final level . God mode . You wanna talk moral implications ? We 're not the ones asking for money , devotion , preaching hate ... and telling people that they 're sinful , teaching them to maim and kill . We 're showing them the truth . Then you mean this is free ? The ' closest to God ' isn 't just for monks and priests , self-proclaimed prophets . It 's personal . Within us . Every one of us . Brain hack needs to go public . On the internet , festivals , TV . If everyone had seen what we 'd seen ... We could end wars . I once asked why you were in film class . Well now you know . We 're making a short film ; half documentary , half dramatic fiction . We may need to embellish the story . Just enough to get the audience on the edge of their seat . Get the adrenaline pumping . Beat the defense mechanism . Because at the end of the film , we show the Brain Hack . Live and uncut . It 's untested , unsafe . Are they ready for it ? They have to be . If you don 't want to see the results ... look away now .

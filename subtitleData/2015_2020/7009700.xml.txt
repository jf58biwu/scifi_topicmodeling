 Are you okay ? Is she all right ? Come on , come on , baby . Come here , honey , come here . Let Mommy check you . Come here . Come over here . Is it your head ? Did the car go bump ? It 's okay . All right . You 've gotta take her . Okay ? So ... It 's about two miles north . No , no , no . He said someone 's gonna meet us . All right , go with Mommy . What about you ? What about you ? No . No , no , it 's all right . You go . Go ! Run , run , run ! Run , run ! I 'll be right behind you . Come on . Here we go . Faster . Watch your step . Careful . Watch the road . Go to the left , honey . Come on . Go quickly . Go left . Here you go . Do you see her ? Do you see her ? She went that way . Stay here , hon . Stay there . Come here , honey . Good girl . We 're gonna hide right here . Quick , quick , quick . Put your head down . Good girl . Now be very quiet , okay ? Be quiet . Check behind that tree . Mommy ? Shh , shh . Quiet , baby girl . Quiet . I don 't see her . Pull up around there ! Here we go . Good girl . Good girl . Mommy ! Mommy , they 're coming ! Move ! Stop her ! - We got her ! - No ! - Mommy ! - No ! No ! No ! Take her ! No ! Hannah ! No ! Please ! Please don 't take her ! Please don 't take her ! No ! - Mommy ! - No ! Stop it ! No ! Please ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Please ! - Mommy ! - Please don 't ... No ! A chair . A table , a lamp . There 's a window with white curtains , and the glass is shatterproof . But it isn 't running away they 're afraid of . A Handmaid wouldn 't get far . It 's those other escapes . The ones you can open in yourself given a cutting edge . Or a twisted sheet and a chandelier . I try not to think about those escapes . It 's harder on ceremony days , but thinking can hurt your chances . My name is Offred . I had another name , but it 's forbidden now . So many things are forbidden now . So , here you are . You can sit . I don 't make a practice of it , but just this one time . So . Old what 's  his  name didn 't work out ? No , ma 'am . Tough luck . This is your second posting then ? Yes , ma 'am . Good . Our last one was brand new . It was like training a dog , only not a very smart one . I expect you know the rules . Yes , ma 'am . Don 't call me ma 'am . You 're not a Martha . Well , look what the cat dragged in . This is the new one . Hello . Blessed be the fruit ... May the Lord open . I 'm Commander Waterford . Peace be to you . May God make me truly worthy . Right . Well . Good . Nice to meet you . You too . Get up . I want to see as little of you as possible . Do you understand ? Yes , ma ... Yes . Mrs. Waterford . He is my husband until death do us part . Don 't get any ideas . If I get trouble , believe me , I will give trouble back . Rita makes the bread from scratch . It 's the kind of thing they like the Marthas to do . A return to traditional values . That 's what they fought for . Always showing up when I 'm in the midst of something . Hold your horses . Just coffee for you this morning ? Duty calls , I 'm afraid . I 'll be in my office . Something wrong ? Just a conference call with my field commanders . Then meetings . Always a lot of meetings . Right . Well , you need to be early tonight . Of course . I know it 's hard , but keep faith . We 'll be rewarded . I promise . The Commander likes his eggs lately . Make sure they 're fresh , not like last time . Let them know who it 's for and they won 't mess around . All right . Thank you . You gonna stand there all day ? Be rude , leaving your friend outside waiting . I want to tell her that Ofglen is not my friend . That I 've exchanged barely 50 words with her in the two months since I got here . I kind of want to tell her that I sincerely believe that Ofglen is a pious little shit with a broomstick up her ass . Under His eye . Under His eye . Sorry . He 's the Commander 's driver . Lives over the garage . Low status . Hasn 't even been issued a woman . Going shopping ? No , Nick , I 'm gonna knock back a few at the Oyster House Bar . You wanna come along ? Yes . If you 're going to All Flesh , you should avoid the chicken . I read they 've got crazy levels of dioxin . I 'm going to Loaves and Fishes . Then you should definitely avoid the tuna . Mercury ? No , I just don 't like tuna very much . Maybe he 's lonely . Maybe he watches me . Maybe he 's an Eye . Peace be with you . Blessed be the fruit . May the Lord open . Offred ? Are you okay ? Yes . Pious little shit . Very well , thank you . Thank you for asking . We go everywhere in twos . It 's supposed to be for our protection . For companionship . That 's bullshit . There are no friends here . Can 't be . The truth is we 're watching each other . She is my spy and I am hers . We 've been sent good weather . Which I receive with joy . The war is going well , I hear . By His hand . We 've defeated more of the rebels . They had a stronghold in the Blue Hills . We smoked them out . Praised be . Some artistic ones , please . Yeah . Offred . We should go . Hey . Under His eye . Did you see ? They have oranges . Praised be . The fighting in Florida must be going well . Your Mistress likes oranges . Make sure she knows you got them . Don 't let a Martha take the credit . I don 't ... I don 't have a token for oranges . Tell them you 're Commander Waterford 's . He 's really high up . His name 's in the news . I didn 't read it . I promise ... We should get some oranges before they 're all out . Praised be His bounty . Take some . I don 't need oranges . I need to scream . I need to grab the nearest machine gun . Should we walk home by the river ? That would be nice . A priest , a doctor , a gay man . I think I heard that joke once . This wasn 't the punch line . They made such a mess of everything . They filled the air with chemicals and radiation and poison ! So , God whipped up a special plague . The plague of infertility . Welcome ! Find a seat , please . As birthrates fell , they made things worse . Birth control pills , morning  after pills , murdering babies . Just so they could have their orgies , their Tinder . Your turn . No , thanks . What do you mean ? I have to write that paper tonight . For Dietrich 's class ? Yeah . What 's it about ? Campus sexual assault . For or against ? Moira , come swimming . - It 's too cold , babe . Stop . - Come on . All right . I 'll be right there . I 'll be right there . What 'd she say ? She just said , " Let 's go to church . " Did she ? What 's her name ? You don 't know her name , do you ? Moira ! Come on ! Write your paper ! There 's a seat here . Right there . They were dirty women . They were sluts . But you are special girls . Fertility is a gift directly from God . He left you intact for a Biblical purpose . Like Bilhah served Rachel , you girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful and their barren wives . You will bear children for them . You are so lucky ! So privileged ! The fuck ? Welcome to the friggin loony bin , right ? All right , girls . We will have silence . Like little mice . Okay . Welcome to the Rachel and Leah Center . Up . Fuck you . Blessed are the meek , dear . Blessed are the meek . Don 't ! They always left out the part about inheriting the Earth . Fuck ! Get the fuck off of me ! Eyes front ! Where do your hands belong ? Girls . I know this must feel very strange . But " ordinary " is just what you 're used to . This may not seem ordinary to you right now , but after a time , it will . This will become ordinary . I tried to run ... With her , but she 's ... She was so heavy . I really tried . Hey . I know . You 're gonna get her back , all right ? Just gotta keep your head down . All this crazy shit is gonna end and then we 'll find her . I swear . Do you pinky swear ? Yeah , I fucking pinky swear . Okay . What about Odette ? She was rounded up in one of the dyke purges . She was reclassified as an Unwoman sent to The Colonies . You have ... I don 't wanna ... I can 't ... Moira , what 'd they do to her ? " If my right eye offends thee , pluck it out . " We 're breeding stock . You don 't need eyes for that . Moira isn 't up there . And that gives me hope . It may be false hope , but , hey , it 's something . Should we take the long way ? I can 't . I have to get ready for the Ceremony . Praised be . We 'll go straight home , then . May God bless your endeavor and bring forth His miracle . Praised be . A bath is required before the Ceremony . I am to make myself clean . Washed and brushed like a prize pig . She comes to me so clearly in the bath . When do I come to her ? Does she remember me ? Please , God . Let her remember me . I want to know what I did to deserve this . The boys just kept coming down into the basement . For hours , it felt like . I don 't know , two , maybe three at a time . I knew most of them . From school . I just couldn 't believe they were doing it , that it was actually happening . But it did happen . Didn 't it ? Yeah . And who led them on ? Whose fault was it ? I don 't know . Whose fault was it , girls ? Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Her fault ! Go on , do it . And why did God allow such a terrible thing to happen ? Teach her a lesson ! Teach her a lesson ! Teach her a lesson ! Teach her a lesson ! Teach her a lesson ! Teach her a lesson ! Those eggs you got today were nice and fresh . I wish they 'd hurry up . Some of us got things to do , you know ? Hurry up and wait . Late again , as usual . What is it about men ? The knock is prescribed 'cause tonight this room is her domain . Come in . It 's a little thing , but , in this house , little things mean everything . Good evening . Dear . Now , let 's get started . Excuse me . " And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children , " " Rachel envied her sister , and said unto Jacob , . " " Give me children or else I die . " " And she said , ' Behold my maid , " " ' Bilhah . " " ' Go in unto her ... ' " " ' ... and she shall bear upon my knees " " ' that I may also have children by her . ' " " And she gave him Bilhah , their Handmaid , to wife , " " and Jacob went unto her . " Get out . Are you deaf ? The ... The ... The chances are ... Are better if I ... If I lay on my back afterwards . Just get out . The moon 's the same . That 's something . They haven 't changed that . I 'll think about the moon . I can feel the Commander 's come running out of me . I can smell it . Hello . How are you ? Good morning . How are you ? Hello . Good morning . How are you this morning ? Hello . Hi . Hello ? Good morning . Janine ? I 'll be your server this morning . Can I get you some coffee to start ? Put your clothes on , dummy . Aunt Beth is on bed check . I don 't want extra prayers on account of you . Alma , go to bed , don 't make this a thing . You 're having a dream , okay ? Wake up . Good morning , welcome . Hey , come here . Snap out of it . Hello now . How are you ? Janine ? Snap out of it . Janine ! - Good morning . - Come on . How are you today ? You 're not there anymore . That 's all gone . Now , get back into bed . What 'd you hit me for ? Wasn 't it good ? I can bring you another one . My name is Moira and this is the Red Center . I don 't know any Moira . Don 't you know what they 'll do ? They 'll send you to The Colonies . You 'll be cleaning up toxic waste . Your skin will peel off in sheets and then you 'll die . You will die , Janine . I want ... I want my mom . I want my mom . Okay . I wanna go home . I know . Come here . Put this on . Here you go . Come on , get into bed now , okay ? Come on . And shut up . She does this again and I 'm not around , you slap her . Hard . Yeah , okay . Hey , that shit is contagious . You want to see your baby girl again ? Then you need to keep your fucking shit together . Keep your fucking shit together . He saw me outside last night . But the Eyes haven 't come for me . There 's no black van . He hasn 't told anyone . Not yet . Why not ? Three bells . There 's a Salvaging today . Blessed day . I 've been called ... I heard . So , now I 've got my work to do and your shopping . I 'm sorry . Good morning . Morning to you . Praised be . The Commander wants you to get more oranges , if they still have any . Yes , sir . My pleasure . Any other special requests ? They had tuna at Loaves and Fishes yesterday . It looked good . You should ... You should get some . Oranges and tuna . Sounds delicious . Under His eye . Under His eye . Go in Grace . Blessed be the fruit . May the Lord open . Under His eye . Under His eye . Hey . Hi . Where are you posted ? Commander Ellis . He can barely get it up . Where are you ? Waterford . Fancy pants . Nice house , I bet . Have you heard about anyone ? I saw Gabby a few months ago . She had a miscarriage . That sucks . Have you heard from Moira ? No . Not since the Red Center . Me neither . She 's dead . Janine ? Quiet ! Janine ? Who 's dead ? Moira . Yeah . Yeah , she tried to run away . They caught her , and they sent her to The Colonies . So , she 's dead . She 's dead by now . To your places . Quick , quick . Kneel . Well . Good morning , girls . Good morning , Aunt Lydia . I am sure we are all aware of the unfortunate circumstances that bring us together on this beautiful morning , when I am certain we would all rather be doing something else . But duty is a hard taskmistress , and it is in the name of duty that we are here today . This man has been convicted of rape . As you know , the penalty for rape is death . This disgusting creature has given us no choice . Am I correct , girls ? Yes , Aunt Lydia . Offred . But that is not the worst of it . Now , you know that I do my very best to protect you . The world can be quite an ugly place . But we cannot wish that ugliness away . We cannot hide from that ugliness . This man raped a Handmaid . She was pregnant . And the baby died . Quiet , please . Now , girls , up . Wings . You may come forward and form a circle . You all know the rules for a particicution . When I blow the whistle , what you do is up to you . Until I blow it again . Offred , are you all right ? Have a nice day . Hey . Sorry . Fucking Uber . Hey , it 's okay . You put our name in ? Yeah , be about 20 minutes . What ? We 'll freeze our nuts off . You want to go somewhere else ? Hi . What 's wrong ? Sorry , I 'm just ... I 'm trying to get a hold of Luke . He staying over in Essex and there 's , like , shitty cell phone reception there . Okay . Um , so , I think I 'm pregnant . What ? My God , are you ... Holy shit , come here ! My God ! What ? Don 't worry . Don 't worry . Getting pregnant is the hard part , that 's what they 're saying . And you did it . That 's not all they 're saying , though , you know ? I know five women at work who 've had miscarriages . Some of them were pretty far along . Yeah , well , that 's not going to happen to you . You know Linda from Marketing ?  yeah . She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days . That 's not gonna happen . But you don 't know that , Moira , okay ? You don 't know that . It could happen . Okay , all right , um ... If it does ... Yeah ? You 've got a good man . And you 've got me . No matter what happens , I 'll be right here . You and me , just like always . I am so sorry about your friend . Moira ? You knew her from the Red Center ? And before . Was there ever a " before " ? This used to be an ice cream place . They had the most amazing salted caramel . It was better than sex . Like , good sex . I always thought you were such a true believer . So were you . So frickin ' pious . They do that really well . Make us distrust each other . Eyes . Come on . Just keep walking . How old is your daughter ? Eight . She 'd be eight . My wife and I had a son . Oliver . He 's almost five . They had Canadian passports . I didn 't . I got caught at the airport . We tried to cross in Maine . With my husband . Then we split up . They shot him . They weren 't going to let any of us get away . Not if you had a red tag . This is your stop . As they used to say . It was nice to finally meet you . You too . There 's an Eye in your house . Be careful . Blessed be the fruit . Gentlemen ? Please , let 's continue in my office . No rest for the weary . We 'll join you for dinner . Go back to your room . Someone is watching . Here , someone is always watching . Nothing can change . It all has to look the same . Because I intend to survive for her . Her name is Hannah . My husband was Luke . My name is June .

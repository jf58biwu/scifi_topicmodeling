That 's why the kids in mount weather are in trouble . My kid is in trouble . They tried to kill her , marcus . They missed . Clarke is strong . She 's not that strong . The grounders look at her like she 's our leader , And now mount weather does , too . Clarke is holding this alliance together , And without that , the war is lost .

Go back to the dorm and tell your friends To pack their things . You 're going home . Thank you . Take me to my son . Yes , sir . Please answer the question . Carl emerson , Mount weather security detail . As you already said . You don 't seem to be grasping the situation here . You should 've died in the woods . We saved your life . Why not help us bring an end to all this ? Carl emerson , Mount weather security detail . He 's not gonna talk . He will if we open the door . [ beep ] We are not doing that . We need to know what he knows- - Vulnerabilities , troop numbers . She 's right . Torture doesn 't work . Clarke , it could save your friends . I 'm the chancellor . Then act like one . I told you i would support you as long As i believed that you were doing The right thing . I am , and if you disagree , Convene a vote and take my place . I don 't give a damn about the title . I just want to save our people . So do i . I want this man under 24-hour guard . Is that clear ? There are 382 people inside this mountain . If any of them realize you 're not one of us , You 're dead . [ beep ] We 're on level two . The dorm is on five . There 's a camera in the upper right-hand corner . Keep your head down . Man : Hold the elevator . Hey , maya . You know , i missed you in my expressionists class . Yeah . I- - I had some work to do . Ah . I 'll get you the notes .

What about you ? This is my job . I 'll be fine . Keep the handkerchief . Man : Eyes on the ark camp , sir . Cage : Still no word from emerson ? Uh-uh . There 's something wrong . The team at tondc hasn 't checked in , either . Everything ok ? Tell me dr . Tsing was working alone . I can 't do that . We 've accomplished great things . You 've accomplished nothing . You 're a stain on our legacy . Our legacy ? We 've been bleeding people To stay alive for generations . That 's our legacy . What we 've done is gonna get us Out of this prison . How could you not want that for us ? You betrayed me . You betrayed us all . Take him into custody . I never wanted it like this . All i wanted was to give you your dream . I gave you an order . I 'm sorry . They take their orders from me now . Everyone wants to go to the ground . You can 't blame them . Put my father in quarantine . Yes , mr . President . [ radio chatter ] [ 1,760 hz tone ] Yeah . I can totally replicate this frequency . Clarke : Good . If we can neutralize the reapers , The tunnels are an option . Get on it . You don 't need to give me orders , clarke . I got this . Octavia : Raven , any word from bellamy ? Nothing yet . Lincoln is still missing , too . He should be back by now . They 'll be ok . They better be . Your whole plan rests on bellamy getting in . He will . Man , on p.A. : Counselor kane and clarke griffin , Please report to the south airlock immediately . Clarke : We 'll finish this later . Did he say something ? No ... But his blood did . Jackson found genetic marker anomalies That can only come from someone Who was born on the ark . It 's started . It didn 't come from the blood transfusion That we gave him ? No . I took the sample before that . They 're bleeding my friends . Kane : We don 't know that . Yes , we do . We were genetically engineered . They weren 't . What are you doing ? Killing him . Get out of my way , kane . Calm down . Clarke ... You are not in charge here . We do things my way . Woman : Ok . Come along . Inside . Woman on p.A. : Homeroom has now begun . All students should now be in their classrooms . Come on . Mister ... Are you on a ground unit ? My dad is training for a ground unit . It 's pretty cool up there . I hope he makes it . [ sighs ] They 're just kids . What did you expect you 'd find here ? Woman : Who 's gonna be my helper ? Boy : I want to help . Different boy : Me ! Me ! Woman : All right . Come up here . Jasper : All right . Listen up . There 's gonna be questions , but there 's no time . We 're getting out of here . So pack your stuff . Fox : What are you talking about ? What , they 're just letting us go ? Jasper : Yes , right now before they change their minds . Fox : But , jasper , what the hell is going on ? They lied to us the whole time About everything . Man : What ? What did they lie about ? The ark is on the ground , and we 're not safe here . Do what he says . Now . There they are . [ buzzer ] No ! What 's going on ? I don 't know . It 's not a breach , but it can 't be good . Get me to that radio . Jasper , on radio : This is jasper jordan . We need help . 47 of us are trapped inside ... We 're too late . They 're already bleeding them . Jasper : They 've taken harper , and she may already be dead . We don 't know how much time we have left . It 's over . No . You don 't get to give up , clarke . You killed finn , and i didn 't give up . I 'm building a damn tone generator . You do your job . What is my job ? I don 't know , to come up with something . I have tried . Bellamy , on radio : Camp jaha , this is mount weather . Can anyone read me ? Holy crap . Bellamy , on radio : Camp jaha , this is mount weather . Can anyone read me ? Bellamy ? Clarke ? Are you all right ? Bellamy : I 'm fine . That 's it for the good news . We have to talk fast . Something has changed . Jasper , monty , everyone , they just locked them in the dorm . But they 're alive , all of them ? I think so , for now . Maya says that they 're already using their blood , And things are gonna get ugly in here real fast . Maya is with you ? She helped me escape . If not for her , i 'd be dead . And , clarke , there are kids in here . We need a plan that doesn 't kill everyone . Please tell me we have one . Clarke : I hear you , but we can 't do anything Until you disable the acid fog . Raven is gonna help you . Bellamy : Got it . What else ? You have to figure out a way To free the grounder prisoners . There 's a whole army inside that mountain , And they don 't even realize it . Trojan horse . Good plan . What does maya think ? Is it doable ? She says it 's not a problem . Look . If i 'm gonna pull this off , I need you to buy me some time . It won 't be long before they realize I don 't belong here , and if that happens- - That can 't happen . I 'll come up with something . Come up with it quick . Copy that , and , bellamy ... Yeah ? You came through . I knew you would . All i 've done so far is not get killed . Keep doing that . You 're up . What are you gonna do ? Gonna keep them looking outside instead of in . [ music playing ] Uh-uh . Don 't . Get dressed . You 're coming with me . What 's going on ? Man : Hey , look at this . They 've got emerson . Clarke , what are you doing ? Clarke , stop . No . I 'm letting the prisoner go . Absolutely not . He hasn 't told us anything yet . He doesn 't have to . He 's gonna tell them something . Get the prisoner back to the airlock now . Yes , ma 'am . [ swords unsheathed ] You may be the chancellor , but i 'm in charge . Indra , tell your people to stand down Before this gets out of hand . No . People could get hurt . Not if you get out of my way . You need to trust that i know what 's right for us . The grounders trust clarke . Maybe we should , too . Stand down . Stand down . Open the gate now . [ gate opening ] Can you hear me all right ? Because i need to make sure you get this . Loud and clear . I have a message for your leader . We 're coming for him . You 're watching us , but you haven 't seen a thing . The grounder army is bigger than you think , And even if you could find it , Your acid fog can 't hurt them , And now , thanks to you ... [ 1,760 hz tone ] Neither can the reapers . So you have one last chance . Let our people go , and we 'll let you live . It 's just that simple . I got it . It 's an 8-hour walk back to mount weather . You 're gonna do it in 6 . 6 hours ? That 's not enough . How am i supposed to deliver your message ? That 's your problem . Now go . Guard him . You want to explain to me how this helps my brother ? I just told him we have a secret army To worry about . The more they 're looking at us , The less they 're looking at him . Bellamy is the key to everything , octavia . If he dies , we die .

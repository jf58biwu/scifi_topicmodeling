 Previously on the expanse ... He 's hypoxic . His breather 's crapping out ! You can breathe off mine , okay ? Breathe it in . My name is james holden , Speaking for the five survivors of the canterbury . Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus sos from a ship called the scopuli . We are about to be taken aboard the mcrn donnager . Alex , shut him down ! We have the right to legal ... Good golly , ms . Mao . You sure can pick ' em . curfew is now in effect on medina level . Do you think i 'm opa ? These are the hallmark skill sets of terrorists . Mars didn 't destroy the canterbury . Then who did ? I flew with the mars navy for 20 years Before i shipped off on the cant . Are you opa ? We putting all our cards on the table here ? Sleeper agents . You ever heard of them ? Well , screw you ... Guys ! Human shields , you ever heard of those ? Hey ! I 'm ready to talk , but only to your captain . Come on , guys , it 's over . Just ... Just go home . No , no , no ! sorry to keep you waiting , we 've been busier than usual . Still getting intakes from all over the medina , even from uptown . You know what the average life expectancy on earth is ? No . 123 years . It 's even better on mars . You know what it is on ceres ? 68 . And with the recent unpleasantness , that average is only going down . What ? Nothing . I 'm sure you 're younger than you look . Stiff 's id is bizi betiko . You know , there is no religious directive on file , So okay if i recycle him ? Factory on 39 needs some fertilizer . Not yet . I 'd like to know what the hell holden is discussing with the captain right now . For all we know , he could be working out a deal . Yeah , for himself . The only thing i see here is an incoming ship . One you can 't even identify . How do you know they 're coming for naomi ? We don 't . It 's a guess . And you 're just guessing naomi 's opa , too . We both know that 's better than a guess . She is the best liar amongst all of you , by far . And she is hiding something . You can sense that , too . I don 't believe she 's a terrorist . And even if she was , i 'm not blaming her for the canterbury . You blamed it on us . We found martian naval tech in the beacon that lured us to the scopuli , And then you showed up . We had nothing to do with the canterbury , But because of you , earth thinks we destroyed it . Some people are calling it an act of war . You need to recant . Blame nagata . True or not , it will change the narrative until cooler heads prevail And figure out what really happened . I won 't do it . There 's some kind of game being played here . Maybe someone wants a war , i don 't know , But if you really do want to stop it , then let us go and then we talk . Captain , inbound vessel approaching defense perimeter . One minute to contact . Hail them . Frequencies open . Unidentified vessel , this is captain theresa yao , of the mcrn donnager . This is your final warning . If you maintain your present course you will be fired upon . they 're jamming us . Multiple fast movers detected ! More than one ship . I count six bandits . Missile launch alert . Sound general quarters . All hands , battle stations . prepare to return fire . What 's happening ? That 's battle mode lighting . Must be a drill . okay , what 's that ? It sounds like torpedoes being fired . Sounds like a lot of torpedoes . I don 't think it 's a drill . Maybe we should get strapped in . Good idea . Torpedoes are away ! Guidance lock on all targets . Well , whoever they are , and whatever they 've come to do , It 's just become a suicide mission . They started this fight , and we 're going to finish it . We can 't tell who they 're fighting . There 's massive ladar and radar jamming , We can 't resolve the drive signatures or make any visual ids . They took our people hostage . We have to get a ship there . The orinoco 's en route at best possible speed , But they 're still two days out . It 'll all be over by then . Somebody has a new fleet of warships . I concur . Any idea who it might be ? Not yet . Keep me apprised . While i was so young , i was wiser than they thought . " dear , dear , " says i , " punishment is death . " " aye , " says he , " if they can get hands on me . " Man 1 : Incoming targets at 15 ... Man 2 : Let 's get an additional readout on this ... You look nervous . I get that way when missiles are flying at me . Don 't worry . It 's nothing our guns can 't handle . I take it you didn 't see much action in the un navy ? That was a good thing . Not for soldiers . The only combat most of my officers have seen is in simulators . Fortunately , i got to spend three years cleansing the belt of pirates Who were poaching terraforming supplies intended for mars . I 'm sure they weren 't all bad people . But sometimes you have to kill to preserve . captain yao , you 're needed on comms deck two . Pdcs ready ? All arrays are online and standing by . Appa says you shouldn 't be on the roof . And you should ? They 're nothing to be scared of , you know . They 're just little rocks that burn up in the sky . They 're not always so little . You mean like the one that killed the dinosaurs ? Uh-huh . Okay , that rock was big . But that hardly ever happens . Like winning the lottery . I worry about people who throw rocks . nobody could throw rocks that big . It just happens , sometimes , because , you know , gravity . Hmm . Come in and play . I 'll come and put you to bed . you 're no fun . May i ask you a question ? Do you miss earth ? If i did , i 'd go back . My great-uncle emigrated from earth . He missed it terribly . He used to tell me stories when i was a little boy About these endless blue skies , Free air everywhere . Open water all the way to the horizon . He told me that someday we would make mars just like that . When you spend your whole life living under a dome , Even the idea of an ocean seems impossible to imagine . I could never understand your people . Why , when the universe had bestowed so much upon you , You seemed to care so little for it . Wrecking things is what earthers do best . Martians , too , by the look of your ship . We are nothing like you . The only things earthers care about is government handouts . Free food , free water , free drugs so that you can forget the aimless lives you lead . You 're short-sighted and selfish , And it will destroy you . Incoming torpedoes in pdc range , one minute . Earth is over , mr . Holden . My only hope is that we can bring mars to life before you destroy that , too . Secure the prisoner . Yes , sir . Get in the chair . Come on . I hope you enjoy the show . Lock pdcs and engage . Pdcs are go . Splash one ! Five more to go . Is there a problem ? No , sir , it 's just their torps ' guidance systems are really good . Better than anything we ever simmed against . They 're pushing our pdcs to the limit . Impact on main reactor housing . Captain , enemy ships are now inside guided missile range . Torpedoes will no longer be effective . Enough of this . Bring up the rail guns . Let 's finish this and go home . Aye , sir . Diverting power to rail guns . ( indistinct announcement over pa ) over pa ) I 'm looking for bizi betiko . You 're not going to find him here . Why you pensa ? Why you pensa ? Why you pensa ? Why you pensa ? This is his place , right ? So , ya , that it is . Which puts me at 29 days , Seven hours and 13 minutes Of pura , unpowered flight . I carve it up around the big-gas , then load up more spin ... Romanov . ... Going ' round the ringer . It 's only three million clicks of hard vacuum To hit a bull 's-eye smaller than a mosquito 's ass And fly my way into the record books . Slingshot club . Yeah . Oh , for entertainment purposes only , sasa ke . No license required . Ah , i don 't give a crap about that . Huh ? Wanna bet , ke ? Action good tonight . All right , listen up ! Star helix . I 'm looking for a girl . Her name 's julie , she was a pilot . Oh . She might 've come to bizi to charter a ship ? Oh . Here . Hey , assholes . Bizi betiko is dead . He ain 't dead yet , copeng . He be out there . That bizi betiko ! Watch the way it 's done ... sabaka ! bizi , bizi , bizi , bizi ! Come on , come on , come on . Come on , come on , come on . Come on , come on , come on . Now he dead . should 've bet . Should 've bet . The nauvoo 's engines have all been tested and certified , And we 've been able to continue laying down the hull at the same time . Which means , everything is proceeding on schedule And on budget , which i 'm sure you 're pleased to hear . Mr. Johnson . The latter day saints took a considerable risk hiring you to build the nauvoo . I know . Tycho spins up asteroids . We don 't build ships , not till now . But trust me , it 'll be a ship no one will ever forget . That 's not what i meant . I meant you . There have been rumblings That you should be replaced as head of operations for the project . Why is that ? Your ties to the opa have been making A number of elders in the general authorities uncomfortable , Particularly in light of the recent events in the belt . The opa is only interested in human rights And jobs for all belters . And fomenting riots on ceres . And inflaming passions in the wake of the canterbury . The history of organized religion isn 't exactly strife-free . I 've been asked to request a new head of operations . Of course . If that 's what you want . But i 'd be remiss if i didn 't remind you that , without me , You 're going to have a very difficult time retaining The most skilled belters for your project . I mean the ones who build for reliability . You 're about to send your best and brightest mormons On a hundred-year voyage to a new world around a new sun . Who knows what tragic malfunctions might occur along the way ? So who 'd you have in mind ? We 're still weighing our options . For now , uh , please just continue along , as before . Great . We have some calibration work to do on the nauvoo 's sensor arrays . So i 'm going to need you to get all your people off the ship And i 'll let you know when we 're done . We 're good to go . Get all the mormons off the ship And get those sensors pointed toward the donnager . I need a full report , now . They 've got rail guns , too . I 've never seen them on ships this size . Shit . I think they 're diverting power to the rail guns . That means we 're in cqb . What the hell is cqb ? A close quarter battle . Who would be insane enough to take on the donnager in cqb ? God damn it , let me out of this chair ! I don 't need to be here . Put me back with my people . Keep him quiet or gag him . I want ids . We need to know their capabilities . I 'm sorry , sir , but there 's nothing matching their profile In mcrn or un records . Isolate each vessel . I want detailed imagery and drive signatures on every one of them . captain to dc-4 . I 've seen a ship like that before . Splash three and four ! Lieutenant , the main drive is overloading . We have to shut it down . Uh , guys ... the drive 's out . Good . No , this ain 't good at all . You know , for a badass mickie navy boy , You 're a pretty whiny little bitch . I was just a transport pilot , you yahoo ! You understand ? I wasn 't trained for this shit ! I was a glorified bus driver , okay ? You satisfied ? Oh , man , this is not supposed to be happening . Shh , hey , alex . No , no , no , no , no , no ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Look what i got . Huh ? Everything 's going to be okay , okay ? This is going to calm you right down . Trust me , we 're all going to be just ... We need to plug the holes ! Hooshing ) Rail gun one is down , master caution is lit . Man down ! Medics to cic . You said you 've seen this ship before . One just like it blew up the canterbury . Can we get security to the hull , please . They stopped firing . Why ? Confirm massive hull damage . Breaching pods on deck . We 're being boarded . Captain , this man has something to tell you . Not now , lieutenant . The ships you 're fighting are just like the ones that blew up the canterbury . Whoever 's responsible for this is trying to frame mars for everything . Lopez , i want you to get mr . Holden off of this ship And safely back to mcrn command . He 's the only person who can directly testify to this . Understood , sir . Take him . Hold on . I 'm not going anywhere without my shipmates . Get him in his suit ! Make sure you get this off with him . The air rushed out of holes on both sides of the room , Which means we 're surrounded by a hard vacuum . We 're trapped . maybe ... Maybe we can force the door . Mars builds too well , you know that . Damn it ! We 'd still be screwed because we don 't have our pressure suits . Atmosphere systems are still out . I figure we have maybe 20 minutes of air left . Crap ! What 're you doing ? Sedative . There 's enough here to take one of us out , which will slow down their breathing And cut down our oxygen use . Maybe buy us a little more extra time . For what ? You think someone 's going to come and get us ? We don 't have comms , we can 't call for help . Do you got a better plan ? It 's my idea . I 'll take the shot . No ! We need you conscious . He 's an earther , he uses the most air . He should do it ! I can carry you . You can 't carry me . Damn it . I wanna wake up . I want to say thank you . You know , For helping me all those times you did . You 're a good person . I could 've been better . I didn 't even get to say goodbye . To who ? It doesn 't matter . You know what really chaps my ass ? The fact that i 'm here protecting some lousy earth taker While my ship 's getting pounded And my buddies are dying . Then why don 't you go help them and let me go help mine . We have our orders . Duty means something on mars . I 'd be happy to let you go . I heard you and your friends were responsible for phoebe . I know nothing about phoebe . Why don 't you just ask him ? Fall back and cover ! Holden ! Get back and stay back ! And stay down ! Holden , stop ! God damn it , holden ! Get back here ! Okay , i 'm here . What 's so important that i had to drop everything And come to this hell hole ? Recognize this guy ? Yeah . The stiff you found in the square . I heard it was a murder . Look at this . Great , you found his id . That 's how it 's supposed to work . It 's not him , see . Every time i sample the guy , i get a different id comes up With a face that looks like it could be a match . Huh . Your stiff 's got a lot of implants . I bet he has an id spoofer mod . They 're designed to spin cops , waste their time chasing down false leads . The only guys who really use them are crooks . Successful ones . They 're not cheap . You are way more of a gear-head than i ever was . Can you help me id him ? Miller , you have a partner for this kind of stuff . No , i tried havelock , he didn 't want to be found . I 've done the same from time to time . Please ? Well , If he has a spoofer , then he 's probably got a bunch of other shady shit in him . Standard inner-ear mike , Spinal stabilizer , Pancreatic pump , run of the mill , for the sedentary . Ha ! He 's got a memory crypt in his calf . let 's take it out . I 'll get the coroner . No . That guy talks too much . Here we go . Damn it . Well , it 's not like i 'm hurting the guy . There . Bingo . Content 's encrypted , obviously . But judging by the file names , these are government records . Okay . Customs documents , corporate rd ... This guy was a data broker . Oh . Well , whatever he brokered , Must have been important enough to get him killed . What 're you not telling me ? Nothing . Miller . It 's better if you don 't know . I don 't need you to protect me . I 'm not protecting you . i ... I hate it when you do this . Thanks . Havelock . come on . All right . Leave him a message . Hey , look , um ... I don 't care if you 're up to your whatever in whoever , But when you come up for air , I 'm gonna need you to cover for me with shaddid , okay ? I can 't give you any details , but just use your imagination , all right ? I know you can be a devious son of a bitch when you want to be . I 'd do the same for you . Oh shit ! Shit ! I 'll get help ! Somebody help ! This officer needs help ! help me ! Let go . Don 't make me shoot you . You won 't . His weapon is keyed to his armor , he couldn 't have fired it . You 're welcome . Mole 's dead , asshole . I 'm sorry , i really am . But i won 't testify to anything Unless you help me get my friends off this ship . Shut up . I want to speak to him . Yes , sir . He doesn 't look like any opa grunt i 've ever seen . Tech is way too advanced . yours . Who are you working for ? Why did you destroy the canterbury ? Phoebe station . Were you there ? You were . What happened ? Listen to me very carefully . If you want medical attention , you start speaking now . We 'll all be dead soon enough . Let 's go . Please . You have to help me get my friends . You wouldn 't leave one of yours behind . We 're marines . We 've sworn to die for each other if we have to . You barely know those other people . They 're only here because of me . I 'll make you a deal . Oh , shed . Hey , are you okay ? ( gasps for breath and coughs ) You came back ? Of course i did . The deal is this . You will all testify that mars had nothing to do With the canterbury 's destruction . Suit up fast , the air seal is temporary . We have to move . What 's wrong with alex ? He took one for the team . I 'll carry him . Come on , buddy . We gotta suit up . We can 't get pinned down again , we need a clear route to the hangar bay . I 'm trying , sir , but our ship is crawling with scumbags . Lopez . Listen . We 've all lost people we care about . And i don 't even have a clue as to why . But i keep hearing about phoebe station . And if we 're all going to die because of it , Can 't you at least tell me what the hell happened there ? Donnager was dispatched to phoebe station after she went silent for several weeks . Why ? We still don 't know . Everyone on board was dead . Their bodies were incinerated . We found them re-frozen to the walls of the ice tunnels . We thought it was a fire or a chemical spill , But then we discovered that all the computer cores were destroyed . You mean someone did it deliberately ? They were covering something up . Like what ? I don 't know . Jesus . What happened ? The captain has set condition zero . She 's going to scuttle the ship . Hull breach , deck four , critical . Boarders are converging on engineering , aux , cic and the bridge . Has the ready standby left the hangar bay ? Negative , sir . It 's still there . Captain . Not yet . This has to count for something . Dookie ready . Grimes in position . Mag boots off . Move as fast as you can . Everybody on my mark . Standby for cover fire . Uh-huh . Hey , hey ! Don 't you quit on me . All right . Ready ? Go ! Go ! What the hell are we supposed to do now ? What about the others ? They 're gone . We have to dust off now . I 'm not a pilot . Someone else needs to fly . What ? Whoa ! Go . Go ! Authorize full operational control of all systems for everyone now on board . Boss , i don 't think i 'm in any condition to ... Get us out of here ! You got it . I need some juice . Okay , sweetheart , be gentle with me . This is my first time . sorry . Evasive maneuvers . Max burn . Do not let anyone stay on our tail . You got it , hoss ... I mean ... Yes , sir . It would 've been nice to see an ocean on mars . The tachi is away . Sir . Captain , this door won 't hold much longer . I didn 't think we could lose . I 'm doing it . I 'm doing it .

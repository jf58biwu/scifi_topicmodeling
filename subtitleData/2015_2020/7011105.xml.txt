 - Previously on Stitchers ... - I don 't love you ! - It was me . I said those things . - Do you think we can trust Ivy ? I 'm not a hundred percent sure . I know what quantum computers are and how entanglement triggers work . He had surgery a couple days ago , and since we 're locked down , I have no idea how he 's doing . Call . Find out . He died . The funeral was yesterday . - You know where she is . - I do . Your mother 's alive and well . One day , you 'll be reunited with her . Kristin , what is it ? Will you talk to me , dammit ? Cameron , you okay there ? Blair wants to kill your mother . Find out where she is and find a way to tell me . - Why are we here ? - To make a deal . My colleagues are being reassigned , I don 't want that to happen . Anything else ? I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers program . Is that it ? No . I 'm looking for someone . My mother . How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory ? Forever . When you were trying to get me to bounce , wh ... what did you mean when you said ... You can 't help me if you 're stuck in here . - I never said that . - But if you didn 't say it , who did ? - ( doors hiss ) - ( somber music playing ) ( doors close ) ( clicking , beeping ) ( mechanical breathing ) Ugh , thank god you 're here . What did you bring me for breakfast ? I didn 't know I was supposed to . You know , considering it was my idea to go all Mommy Dearest on Kirsten in the stitch , I thought I might be at least worth a latte . Also , you don 't come to a person 's house empty-handed . Were you raised in a barn ? - So , is Kirsten up or ... - Up and out . Oh . Where to ? ( chuckles ) I 'm a lotta things , Cameron . Blondie 's keeper is not one of them . - Mm . - Speaking of ... - Hm . - How are you and Kirsten ? - Oh . - Did you guys , you know ... - do it ? - What are you , 12 ? ( chuckles ) I 'm just saying . You know , be gentle . Kirsten 's a virgin . Ahh , I don 't think she 's a virgin . Emotionally . Come on . She 's a virgin . This is gonna be her first real relationship where she 's connected and available , you know ? I got it . I don 't know if you do . I 'm tryin ' to say ... go slow , if you can . 'Cause this thing that you two have affects all of us . Yeah , I said I got it . Yeah ? And what was up in the lab with you yesterday ? Your hands were shakin ' pretty good . I was just tired . It was a crazy couple days , you know ? I guess so . You know what ? Go ahead and get the eggs out . I 'm gonna get dressed while you make me breakfast . - How do you like ' em ? - Prepared by someone other than me . ( exhales wearily ) Sabine . Sabine ? Where did you go ? Sabine ! ( water gurgling ) Sabine ! ( theme music playing ) ♪ Take me inside ♪ ♪ Take me inside ♪ Hey . You seen Kirsten yet ? I have not , but I just got in myself . Oh . How 's your mom holding ' up ? - She 's good . - Mm ? - A rock . - How about you ? A little less rock-like , but , um , my father was my hero , and I 'm gonna soldier on and make him proud . - I know you will . - Thanks , man . Yeah . Hey , uh , I gotta go and talk to Maggie . - What about ? - Stuff . Stuff ? Uh-huh . - Minute ? - Barely . - Question . - Go . - Ivy . - No . Look , I know that you 're feeling a connection with her and that she helped you find out about your father . - She helped all of us . - And still , I don 't trust her , and neither should you . I get it . Stinger had her ear , and there 's no way of knowing what kind of Manson family brain laundry was goin ' on between the two of ' em . Oddly but accurately stated . Who knows what her connection is to him ? I could just ask her . - Done ? - Yes . - Bye . - Good . ( elevator dings ) - ( Kirsten humming ) - Oh ! There you are . - Ooh . You miss me ? - I miss running tests on you . ( chuckles ) Best boyfriend , ever . I know . So , I re-watched the lab video of when you bounced from your memory loop . The " You can 't help me " comment you think I said . - Never said it . - Maybe I imagined it ? That 's possibility number three . Number one is that Stinger said it to you from the hijacked signal . - What 's number two ? - That the days you were trapped in the stitch affected you . - You mean damaged me ? - I didn 't say that . I just wanna run some tests . I 'm worried . I 'm fine . Cameron , we have a stitch to do . We 're gonna do it . We 're gonna keep perfecting the technology , and I 'm gonna be fine . So don 't be a baby , baby . ( chuckles ) Hey , do you wanna get some dinner tonight ? I think we should talk . Okay , about what ? Us . - ( buzzer goes off ) - We 're up . About us ? Now I 'm worried . Victim 's name is Sabine Colt . She 's the daughter of an investment banker , born and raised in New York City , but she 's been living here in LA with her boyfriend , Nic . - Cause of death ? - Drowning . There were signs of a struggle . The M.E. will have a full workup soon . Police are questioning the boyfriend now . - What do we know about him ? - Fisher : Well , he 's got money , and lots of it . But a guy that young usually doesn 't punch his own ticket , so I 'm checkin ' on who 's payin ' the bills . Okay , in the meantime , let 's start with Sabine . - All right , Kirsten , you ready ? - Absolutely . 'Cause if you 're not , you know , we can ... - ( blowing into mic ) - ( feedback ) Is this thing on ? I thought I said , " Absolutely . " Yeah , it 's on , smart-ass . Lights to 20 % , please . Are you ready ? I 'm fine . I need a go , no-go for stitch neuro-sync . Life-Sci ? - Go . - Sub-Bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . - Com check , one-two , one-two . - ( blows into mic ) - ( feedback ) - ( moans ) - Is this on ? - I guess I deserved that . - Induce stitch neurosync on my mark in three , two , one , mark ! Kirsten : It 's Nic and Sabine . - ( glasses clink ) - They 're having drinks . ( Sabine laughs ) Kirsten : It 's very romantic . Really sweet . ( sultry music playing ) Kirsten : Okay , new memory . ( breathing heavy ) - Things are heating up . - What are they doing , K ? Um . Hm . The deed . I 'm getting a spotty neuro-sync on Kirsten . Yeah , yeah , I 'm seein ' that , too . Are you all right , Kirsten ? - ( breathing heavy ) - Fine , just ... watching . Ayo : Her respiration is up . Heart rate , too . Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she 's seeing in the stitch . I 'll have what she 's having . If you want , we can leave you there for a little while , come back later . ( sigh ) - Huh ? - Memory hotspot comin ' up . All right , you 're on the move , Sally . Kirsten : I 'm ... on a street somewhere . It 's ... It 's in New York , I think . It 's ... it 's foggy . Woman : Sabine ! Weather foggy or brain foggy ? I told you , please don 't worry about me . ( sirens sounding ) - Yeah . - You take care of your parents , we 'll take care of you . Just stick to the plan . Kirsten : Some guy just gave her a phone . Wait , I 'm be ... I 'm being pulled to another memory . - ( sultry music playing ) - They 're canoodling again . Sabine : Whatever happened ... ( kiss ) to the big contract ... ( kiss ) your father was hoping to get ? Uh , Sabine 's asking about Nic 's father . Nic : He got it . Ayo : Heart rate and respiration are climbing again . There 's something about a contract . Contract . On it . Uh , I 'm seeing unlock codes for the phone . - Have her call them out . - What are they ? - ( phone beeping ) - Kirsten : 1-2-3-5 . 2-4-6-1 . 8-7-6-4 . ( animal screeching ) I 'm in a field . Sabine has a messenger bag . What 's in the bag ? Kirsten : It 's too foggy , I can 't make it out . ( sultry music playing ) Ayo : Here we go again ... They 're ... they 're having pool sex . As in sex in the pool ? Completely overrated . That 's a true fact . Comin ' up on the death memory . Sabine : Where are you going ? Hey ! Nick ! Where 'd you go ? Aren 't we swimming ? ( screaming ) - What 's happening ? - Linus : Death memory in four seconds . Cameron : Kirsten , get outta there ! Cameron : Ayo , how 's Kirsten ? Chill , Cameron , I 'm fine . Do you need anything , like a water or oxygen ? - Cold shower ? - Knock it off . Sabine was spying on Nic . She shared information about his father 's business with that guy in New York . So Nic found out and killed her . No , he ... he didn 't do it . - Maybe he set her up . - I don 't think so . If Nic didn 't do it , then who ? Nic 's father . Viktor Comenko , Nic 's father , is a powerful businessman with loads of moolah . His company , Novogorsk Steel , just landed a huge contract with the Russian military . That must be the contract Nic told Sabine about . She passed on inside information she got from Nic , pissed off Daddy , - and he killed Sabine ? - Mm , if Comenko had anything to do with it , he didn 't do it himself . Because the big man never leaves , say it with me now ... ( with Russian accent ) Mother Russia . Why ? Because he 's paranoid . Survived three different attempts on his life in the past seven years . Never travels without private security . - So he paid someone else to do it . - Mmm , maybe . But he 's notorious for running the entire operation himself . Doesn 't think anybody can do as good a job at anything as he can . That might not extend to murder . Apparently , the only person Viktor trusts is his son , Nic . By all accounts , Nic is as loyal to Daddy as Daddy is to him . Right . So even though Nic didn 't kill Sabine , he might know more than he told police . Okay , bring him in , get him talking . While Nic 's here , Cameron and I will go search his house , see if we can find the encrypted phone and the messenger bag . ( school bell ringing ) ( knocking on door ) Word 's out that you 're a computer whiz . NSA sent me over to audit your class . That 's cute . - What you really doin ' here ? - I never got a chance to say thank you for what you did for me back at the lab . Letting me call my mother . I 'm sorry , um ... that you didn 't get the news you wanted about your father . At least I found out , so thank you . Look , I gotta ask you straight up . Are you still working with Stinger ? No . I am not working with my father . He made me think there was this big plan to get the family all back together , but ... Kirsten was right . He 's absolutely psychotic . Linus , um , I 've got class . If you wanna practice GarageBand or learn basic programming , stay . If you wanna keep grilling me about my dad , it 's not gonna happen . Look , first , GarageBand is really cool . And second , no more grilling . I ... I believe you . Might be better if you didn 't . It 's just ... it 's gonna get in the way ... of you and your friends . They 're like your family . Yeah , but Kirsten is literally yours . Yeah . It 's a relationship I 'd like to build outside of the lab . Linus , I 've got class . Yeah , I ... I ... I should get goin ' , too . Thanks . Hey ... what are you doin ' later ? Do you wanna hang out , maybe ? Are you asking me out ? Yeah . I thought it was pretty obvious . I have parent-teacher conferences tonight . Yeah . ( Sniffs ) You can pick me up at 8 : 00 . Okay . Let 's talk about Sabine . This is a waste of time . Okay ? I loved Sabine . And whoever killed her , I want them dead . Okay . You loved her . But did you trust her ? Yeah . Of course . Then who was she talking to on her super-secret phone ? What secret phone ? Oh , you know , it 's the type of phone you would use to cheat on your husband , or make a call from a prison cell , or in Sabine 's case , talk about your boyfriend with nefarious types you don 't want him knowing about . She was chatting up somebody about your father pretty good . I 'm not answering any more questions . If you know anything about Sabine 's murder , if you think your father was behind it , you can tell us . We can protect you . I would never be afraid of my father . Now , you guys want more answers ? Come visit me in St. Petersburg . You 're a suspect in a murder investigation . You 're not goin ' anywhere . Well , then you obviously don 't know my father . ( heavy door closing ) ( sighing ) Well , I checked with Washington , and the Russian embassy has intervened , and Viktor Comenko has arranged to have his son sent back home . W ... so that 's it ? Well , I 'm gonna do my best to stop it . In the meantime , we have a new medical examiner in the program . Check in , see if she found any other DNA on Sabine 's body that wasn 't hers or Nic 's . - Maybe the killer left some behind . - You got it . Find anything ? No bag . No phone . Just a lot of unsettlingly green artificial grass . Hm . Well , I couldn 't find anything inside . If Sabine hid something here , she made sure Nic couldn 't find it . - Okay . - Mm . Okay , hold on . You don 't want to ? No , I ... I do . I do , 100 % . It 's just ... I think this might be some sort of reaction to the stitch . It 's not . I 'm just excited . Yeah . You know , th ... that 's ... That 's great , I mean ... you and me , and just ... I 'm your first real emotionally-connected relationship . I ... no , I 'm just sayin ' I ... I just think we need to figure out what that means for us . Hm . Is that what you wanted to have dinner about tonight ? Y ... you wanna have the , uh , " this is how we feel about each other " talk ? Yeah . Hm . I 've never had the talk . Oh , well , I have , and it 's horrible . But then again , so 's modern art . But even something like this is worth a bucket of money to someone . ( phone beeping ) I ... It 's just squares . Kirsten ? What are you ... Do you remember any of the unlock codes ? - Yeah . 1-2-3-5 . - ( phone clicks , beeps ) Okay . Try the next one . And ... ( phone beeps ) ( sighs ) Are you sure you 're remembering these correctly ? I mean , you were a little distracted during that last stitch . - Mm-hm . - Just saying . ( phone beeps ) Four incorrect attempts and this phone bricks . Both : Linus . ( clears throat ) Hello ? - Nasty , right ? - Uh , yeah . Ejected from his car during a high-speed chase , landed on a freeway sign 20 feet off the ground . - Ugh . - Nice shootin ' , Tex . Uh , I 'm looking for the M.E. ? Oh , well , you found her . Amanda Weston . You must be Camille Engelson , from the NSA , right ? I hear you 're snarky . Well , what does that make you ? - Grumpy ? Dopey ? - Doc . Did you want somethin ' ? I wanted to get off on the right foot with you . Well , I already got the rundown of working with you guys , if that 's why you 're here . Send you crime victims , obscure the paperwork , stall the full autopsies until said victims are returned in three to five days ... I am actually here about a case , Sabine Colt ? We 're curious if any DNA was found on her body other than Nic Comenko 's . Right . Because floating in a pool all night isn 't gonna wash away any DNA . The snark is strong with you , too . We make it look good . Uh , DNA results are not back in yet . You think you could speed ' em up ? I could . But I won 't . See , if I put a rush on it , people are gonna ask why , and then I 'd have to tell them about our super-secret NSA program , and then you 'd have to kill them . I guess I 'll wait for your call . Oh ? Well , just need your number . Sure I can 't just text it to you ? Where 's the fun in that ? So , how did it go with M.E. ? Uh , she doesn 't really come off like an M.E. , she 's more like a ... a biker , I don 't know . ( whispers ) " Rebel Without a Corpse . " - DNA ? - Results are pending . Yes . Uh , I should have them soon , but in the meantime , I did some digging , and I found this . Apparently , Sabine 's family made a series of bad investments over the past few years . They are broke ... But with a lifestyle to keep up . That must be the situation that Sabine was trying to help with . She was raising cash for her family . By selling inside information about Nic 's father 's company . But then it became about more than just secrets , something she didn 't wanna be involved in . So , either she got killed for what she did do or what she wouldn 't do . She did sound pretty afraid of whoever was on the encrypted phone . Yeah . It 's locked . We tried the three codes Sabine used in the stitch . They didn 't work . Next failed attempt , and all of the data , including her call history , gets wiped , so we thought maybe Linus could work his magic on it . Yeah , I 'll work my magic first thing in the morn ... No . Tonight . But I 've got someplace that I wanted ... Tonight . That leaves the messenger bag . There wasn 't anything at Nic 's house . I saw Sabine find it in a field . Um ... there was carousel music playing ? Carousels . There are 10 active carousels in the Los Angeles area . - Two of them are in shopping malls , - Not them . - One at the Santa Monica pier , - Oh , got bad memories of that one . - It wasn 't that one , either . - There are carousels at Disneyland and Knott 's Berry Farm . What ? I like carousels . Please , let it be Disneyland . No , it wasn 't either of those . Um ... I heard a screeching noise ? - Mechanical ? - Animal . - Did it sound like this ? - ( bird screeching ) - Ow . Yes . - Well , that would happen to be the love cry of the Pavo Cristatus , AKA the peacock . Two of which are housed adjacent to the Tom Mankiewicz Conservation Carousel at the LA Zoo . - That 's Griffith Park . - Okay , check it out . - Yeah , first thing in the morning ... - No , tonight . - But we were going to ... - Going to ... ? - The zoo . - Yeah , that 's what I thought . ( phone ringing ) Uh , it 's Am ... it 's Amanda ... It 's the M.E. - Take it . - Y ... mm . - ( phone ringing ) - Don 't screw that up . Griffith Park . - Hello . - Hi , Snarky . I got your DNA results . - Tell me . - Not over the phone . We 're on a secure line . Not over the phone . Meet me . Tonight , 9 : 00 p.m. I 'll text you the address . And , Camille ? Don 't be late . ( line clicks , beeps ) Hey . Perfect timing . I 'm almost finished , but , dinner ? About that . Rain check ? Something came up at the lab . - Mm . - I 've got a code to crack . I love me a good code . What is it ? Oh . I 'm sorry . Um , none of my business . Uh , it 's just pattern recognition is kinda my super power . But , uh ... ( scoffs ) I almost forgot ... Daniel Stinger 's daughter . Maybe this is a bad idea . The unlock code is four digits . We 've got four attempts , we 've already burned through three of ' em . One more and the data fries . That 's 10 digits . Uh , that 's the number for Korean barbecue . It 's right down the street . They deliver . Let 's get crackin ' . ( crickets chirping ) I 'm not the , uh , only one who 's been acting differently lately . You have been very jumpy , even by your standards . What are you talkin ' about ? I 'm not bein ' jumpy . I 'm just concerned , you know ? There 's just something 's goin on with you that I don 't understand . - ( bird calling ) - So I hear . Like , why did you think you heard something I didn 't say in that stitch , and ... - ( frog croaking ) - what ... why was that stitch today foggy ? I don 't know . You know , and about what I heard , just forget about it . Maybe ... maybe I 'm not remembering right . Then again , maybe you are , you know . I 'm just trying to be a good scientist . Good scientist ... or worried boyfriend ? Why can 't I be both ? Let 's just talk about this over at ... the rocks . - ( peacock calling ) - She threw it in there . The messenger bag is behind the rocks . What ? There ? No . No , no . No , with all the ... the bugs and the snake and the mud and the things and the ... What are you gonna do , crawl in there and search for it ? - Yep . - Two words : Dinner reservations . One word : Maggie . - ( dance music playing ) - ♪ You do it to me ♪ ♪ Something I do ♪ ♪ You do it to me ♪ ♪ Something I do ♪ ♪ Whoa , you do it to me ♪ ♪ Lover , you do it ♪ ♪ You 're just someone 's clown ♪ ♪ Entertainment , hand it over ♪ Hey , you made it ! I didn 't know you spin ... Spun ... deejayed . Whatever the hell you call it . How would you ? - Uhh ... - Oh . Right . NSA . Yeah . Uh , oh god . The whole reason I 'm here . DNA results . Oh . Only Nic and Sabine 's DNA were found on her body . You fully could 've told me that on the phone . I know , but then you wouldn 't be here drinking whiskey with me . - ( Camille laughs ) - ♪ Whoa , you do it to me ♪ It 's , polynumeric ? Well , there 's no letter substitution that tracks . Steganographic ? Not unless it 's hiding in plain sight . It is a rolling cipher ! Okay . So ... one plus two is three , plus three is six , plus five is 11 , one plus one is two . Multiply that by the first number in the first sequence , it 's two , and the ... Take two , multiply it by the second number in the first sequence , that 's four ! It works ! - Okay . - So ... Both : Two , four , six , three ! ( Ivy laughs ) Are ... are ... Are you sure ? Positive . But , if you don 't trust me , I ... N ... no , no . Go for it . ( chimes ) - Ha ! We did it ! - You did it ! You really have a super power ! Okay , this is the last number she dialed . Right . ( ringing ) ( phone ringing ) - ( flies buzzing ) - ( ringing continues ) I appreciate your commitment . I appreciate the NSA 's dry cleaning policy . You know , there 'd better be a good reason I 'm here right now . Oh , have you been drinking ? I went to a club . Any DNA ? Mm . Well . Lots of DNA being swapped at the club . Negative . Only Nic 's and Sabine 's . What were you doing at a club ? No one . Nothing . Oh my god . Can a girl go to a club by herself ? - What am I looking at ? Where were you ? - Uh , in the mud with the bugs and the snakes and the ... who knows what else . ( door opening ) This better be good . I was in the middle of oysters with Stephanie . Ugh , TMI , Fisher . Hey , sometimes oysters is oysters . What 's inside of the bag ? ( exhaling ) - That 's a lotta coke . - ( whistling ) It wasn 't a squared Fibonacci or a descending harmonic reverse . Just simple rolling cipher . Way to go , man of science . Actually , it was a woman of science . Ivy figured it out . Ivy ? This is a highly-classified NSA investigation ... That Ivy helped us with . You 're wrong about her . I didn 't tell her any details of the case . She just helped me with the code . Sabine used this phone to call this single number . Oh , this is why I 'm here . So seriously , no one else knows how to use a tablet ? Okay . - ( beeps ) - Looks like it 's a New York number registered to a Jack Dalliford , who ... just turned up dead behind a Manhattan pizzeria on Bleecker Street . ( sighs ) I will get his body sent right over . Well ... cheers . ( knocking on door ) Uhh , thank god you 're here . What did you bring me for breakfast ? I thought you needed a ride to work . Those are not mutually exclusive concepts . ( sighs ) I 'll go see what 's in the fridge . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . Camille : Thank you so much . ( phone ringing ) - This better be work-related . - Amanda on phone : Totally . Meet me at the Lowdown for the lowdown . Tonight . I 'm not falling for that again . Come on . I 'm spinning again . Ahhh ... Hey . No sweat . I 'm prolific , baby . Creep my Instagram tonight . See what you missed . I ... I gotta go . Okay . ( Clears throat ) Did I hear the sounds of telephonic flirtation ? What ? No ! Just work . - You met someone . - ( laughs ) No ! Maybe . Whatever . I don 't know . I hope you have . You 're amazing , so you deserve someone equally as awesome . Thank you . So do you . Call him back . What do you have to lose ? I don 't know . Takes me a minute to trust people . Everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise . That sounds like a horrible policy . It is ... unless it isn 't . - Doctor ? - Linus : Doctor . Hey , we plugged the hole on being hacked , yes ? - Yes , totally . - Totally-totally , or ... ? Completely totally . What 's up ? Kirsten heard me say something to her in the stitch which I never said . Glitch or faulty memory ? - Outside force ? - I don 't think so , but I 'll keep an eye on it during the next stitch . - Thanks . Doctor . - Doctor . ( whirring ) - Cameron : Where you at , K-Max ? - Kirsten : Uh , on the street . In New York , I think . How 's the weather ? Stitchy with a chance of fog ? Nope . Clear at the moment . ( phone ringing ) What did you find out ? Sabine on phone : His father got the contract . I 'll be in touch . I 'll be in touch . I 'll be in touch . ( dialing phone ) Buy Novogorsk Steel , as many shares as you can . Kirsten : Sabine called Dalliford , told him about the steel contract , then he called someone else and told them to buy shares of Novogorsk Steel . Dalliford was running an insider-trading scam . It would seem so . Wait , I 'm being pulled into another memory . I 'm in a room . I see Dalliford . - Please stop . - He 's beat up , tied to a chair . Dalliford : Please stop . - ( fist thuds ) - ( gasps ) ( grunts , coughing ) - ( fist thuds ) - ( gasps ) Well ? Novogorsk Steel . You knew to buy shares . How ? Kirsten : Someone 's wailing on him pretty hard . - ( fist thuds ) - Kirsten : Ooh ! They wanna know how he knew about the steel contract . - Can you see the guy ? - Yeah . Bulldog-looking thug . I 've ... I 've never seen him before . Dalliford : Comenko 's son . ( breathing hard ) He ... has a girlfriend . - She 's been feeding me information . - Man : So you 're using a girl to get information from Comenko 's son ? I 'm gonna need her to do something for me . You told me you can control her . Bulldog wants Dalliford to get Sabine to do something for him . She won 't do it . She says that planting drugs on him wasn 't part of the deal . She 'll have to be helpful in some other way ... - Helpful in some other way . - ( knife clicks ) Death memory in four seconds . Get the hell outta there , Kirsten . Make the bounce . - Dalliford : No ! No ! - ( knife stabbing ) Sabine was killed because she wouldn 't plant the drugs on Nic . - To shut her up ? - I don 't think so . What would planting drugs on Nic accomplish ? It would 've gotten him detained , questioned . Yeah , but killing Sabine and making him a person of interest in the murder did that , too . But is that all Bulldog wanted , just to get Nic detained ? What does getting Nic detained buy someone ? Opportunity . Think about it . What would paranoid , afraid-to-leave-Russia-for-fear - of-being-assassinated Viktor Comenko do if the son he was devoted to was in trouble in LA ? He 'd come himself to rescue his son . Which is I 'm guessing is exactly what he 's doing . Now , Comenko can 't travel with his armed detail , so he 's more vulnerable in the states than he was in Russia . Killing Sabine was the bait in a plot to kill Viktor Comenko . And that , my friends , is how the Russian nesting dolls unnest . Okay , we need to find Nic and his father before they both end up dead . None of Comenko 's jets have left Russia in the past 72 hours . Yeah . Wanna know why ? So I said to myself , " If I 'm Comenko " , " I 'd probably have a whack of false papers to use if I need to blow town should Moscow get a hate-on for me , right ? " So I ran Comenko 's photos through the Interpol passport registry and got a hit on three different aliases . I ran those aliases through the Department of Homeland Security airline booking database , and discovered the tickets were issued to one of those aliases . Nicolai and Mikael Karlaff . - Karlaff ? - Flight 1815 . The Comenkos are traveling under that particular alias . They 're probably on their way to LAX now . Okay , I 'll call TSA , have them hold the Comenkos until Fisher can put them in protective custody . Camille ... good work . Hey . Fisher 's going to LAX . I found a couple plane tickets for Nic and Viktor under assumed names . Viktor Comenko wouldn 't fly commercial . He 'd be completely exposed . Okay ... think . What would you do if you were a Russian steel tycoon , and you went someplace you couldn 't take your private militia ? I 'd hire the best I could locally . So , we need to get into Russian banking records and see if he 's hired any LA-based security . How hard could that be ? With enough time it 's not hard , but we don 't have enough time . I 'll be back . Fisher called . The tickets were a smokescreen . Comenko wanted us looking at LAX . You gotta be frickin ' kiddin ' me . - I told you this was a bad idea . - We need her expertise . Ivy worked in banking for years . She knows how to navigate the international banking system . It 's not like she hasn 't seen the inside of the lab before . Cameron , what do you think ? If I 'm being totally honest , I don 't think it 's a good idea . Camille , what about you ? ( clears throat ) Um ... everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise ? ( sighs ) Find Comenko , let 's get it done . ( keys tapping ) Got it . It looks like Comenko 's hired Seraph Private Security on a few occasions over the years when he 's come to Los Angeles . Well , these guys are no joke . Mercs . And looky here . They 've got a full security detail dispatched into a private hangar at the Santa Monica airport in 20 minutes , leaving from Seraph 's headquarters . Where 's Seraph 's headquarters ? Broadway . Downtown LA . Bet you a bitcoin the Comenkos are there now waiting to be taken to their plane . I agree . Call Fisher . Thank you , Ivy . Now it 's time for you to go . ( indiscernible radio chatter ) ( siren blares ) Maggie : Hold it ! NSA ! Drop your weapons ! Nic and Viktor Comenko , we need you to come with us . You are being detained . Technically , I 'm not even here . My son and I are going to the airport - and leaving America now . - We believe your life is in danger . Sweetie , tell me something I don 't know . That 's Bulldog ! Kirsten : Watch out , Nic ! - ( guns firing ) - Kirsten , get down ! ( people screaming ) ( grunts ) Target down ! - Clear ! - Maggie : Fisher , cuff him ! How 'd you guys know to come here ? Sabine showed me the way . ( sirens blaring ) Viktor Comenko was targeted by a competitor in the Russian steel business who lost out on the military contract . He thought killing Comenko would reopen negotiations . How 's Comenko doing ? Stable , and actually grateful for our help . Nothin ' like a bullet to soften a guy up . So , Ivy came through for us again , huh ? I understand that we are split about her , but until we know where her loyalties are , we have to protect ourselves , understood ? New business . Thanks to Kirsten , I will be taking on Blair 's duties , which means that I will be in Washington occasionally . Making the NSA great again ? Nice . Which means I need to appoint someone to take on my responsibilities in the lab when I 'm not here . Now , I have put a lot of thought into this , and the only person that the only person that I think is capable of doing the job ... is Cameron . Maggie , nah , come on , I 'm more of a ... kinda guy . You 'll be great . I 'll brief you before I leave . ( exhales ) So excited . Uh , you got a minute ? Sure . ( clears throat ) Why Cameron ? You mean why not you ? Whoever runs this place , their first job ... is to protect the team . " Everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise " ? That is a bad policy in our business , and can get people killed . - I made a mistake . - Yes . You did . ( softly ) Okay . Kirsten : Look at you , big boss man . Yeah , I have a feeling this isn 't gonna be one of those fun promotions . Oh , well , as long as you don 't abuse your authority and start ordering tests on me . Kirsten ... everything I do is because I care about you . Deeply . I need to know why you think you heard what you heard in that stitch . I need to know that stitching is safe for you . I need you to trust me . I do trust you . I wanna believe that . I really do . But you 're not sure . Let 's just talk about it at dinner . Oh , right , when we have " the talk . " Yeah . I ... I have a better idea . ♪ I put my bag into the back seat ♪ ♪ I drove my heart cross the country ♪ ♪ And now I 'm awake and feel me comin back to life ♪ ♪ Yeah , yeah ♪ ♪ I 'm awake , awake ♪ ♪ Yes , I 'm awake , awake ♪ ♪ I 'm awake , awake ♪ ♪ Yes , I 'm awake , awake ♪ ♪ Till you , until you find me ♪ ♪ Till you , until you find me ♪ - ( doors hiss ) - ( somber music playing ) - ( doors close ) - ( mechanical breathing ) ( clicking , beeping ) Good talk . - resynced to WEB-TBS by enemy _ dave -

 - Previously on killjoys ... - You 've been cleared for level four . Just as soon as you pass your psych eval . - Go see pawter . - You need a rack certified doctor . I 'm the only one around for miles . - You 're passing me ? Well , alright ! The jaqobi brothers together as killjoys . - Asking d 'av to join our team without asking me first ? - He 's your brother , i thought you 'd be happy . He 'll probably just leave again Once he finds that doctor he 's tracking . ( men shouting ) - [ tell me that you got him . ] - Next time you tell me to go east , don 't mean west . - [ he didn 't get him . ] - Fine . Plan b . - [ what 's plan b ? ] - [ the plan where dutch and i take over because you didn 't listen to my directions . ] - No way . It 's my first collar . - My call . - My balls . - One , please . Thank you . Whoops . - So if i touch him first , this could still count as my first catch , right ? - Maybe . Say pretty please . - Touch this ! Bye , hop-bag . ( grunting ) - i do not like him . - Then . Get . Him . - Hey . Hey ! Hey ! Enzo ! - Do you mind ? - Sorry ! Smells delicious . - Lost him . John , you got a bead on him ? - [ go west . ] - your west , or a normal person 's west ? - Funny . - I miss just shooting people . They 're so much easier to catch when they 're dead . - You 're not a soldier anymore , remember ? You 're a killjoy . First official warrant , d 'av . How do you think a miss will look to the rack ? - Fail . The answer is fail . - There . Hey ! - Welcome to plan c , bitch . - No . No , i can 't do another set in west hole . - I hear you , man . But you kind of , uh ... How do i say this ? Chopped up your foreman . People frown at that . - Nowhere else to go . - Except up . So long , shit-stacks ! - Oh , don 't do that . - Screw it , i 'm taking him out . - Stop ! That 's a security wire . Move back . - Why ? What 's it do ? ( screaming ) - That . - Umm , Level four warrants are " live or dead " , right ? - Yep . Yep . ( call signal ) - Dead it is . - Bellus again . What 's up her skirt today ? We 're bringing him in . Someone get a shovel . - You tagged him , you bag him . - " you tag him , you bag him . " - [ we are now 205 minutes behind schedule . ] - ( together ) : Shut up , lucy . - Finally , she shows up . - What 's with all the calls today ? We got the mark like we always do . - Took some doing . - We 're still smoothing out the kinks of working together . - Smooth faster . You 've been requested for a warrant . - Bellus , i 'm still wearing my last warrant . - This one comes direct from the nine . - So i 'm expected to volunteer ? - I 'd say you 're being voluntold . - Voluntold to do what ? - Nothing . We pass . - Enzo galang . As promised . - Congratulations . You 're getting " enzo " all over my desk . Dutch , with me . - I 'm not changing my mind . The nine are a bunch of inbred fascist nobles who think That just because they run the company , they run the quad . - Don 't they ? - Why are you using the good tea ? And whose perfume am i smelling ? - Forgive me , I may have sprayed it on a bit thick . My sense of smell 's a tad ... Inbred . - May i present : Delle seyah kendry , Of the nine . - You couldn 't warn me ? - And miss all this ? - This broker assures me you are the best female killjoy . - I am the best . Period . - I certainly hope so . Come . I require your assistance . - To do what ? - Prevent a war . - ¶ ¶ come come come uninvited ¶ ¶ ¶ run run run ' til i find ya ¶ ¶ i don 't care which side that you 're fighting ¶ ¶ gonna get you gone ¶ ¶ - I need you to transport a young woman to qresh . Provided you can keep Your lovers in check . - Pardon ? - This girl rarely encounters men . It 's critical she 's kept unmolested . - I think my lovers can handle that . - All clear . - Leave us . What i 'm about to tell you is confidential . Two days ago , One of our nine clans , the lahanis , Unexpectedly lost the last of their line . As luck would have it , the family is survived By one last hope : An heir , Implanted in a pristine surrogate . - A leithian vessel . I 've heard of this practice . So , are you nine ... Infertile ? - No more or less than any others . But we of the nine find birth ... Gauche . An unnecessary risk for our wives and daughters . - So you outsource it . - Why not ? Leithian girls make excellent vessels , Raised in an entirely organic environment . - And what 's in it for the surrogates ? - The distinction of incubating us future leaders of the quad . - I 'm guessing it 's not all rosy , If you came all the way here . - If the lahani line were to die out , their lands , And company seat , could be annexed By any of the other nine . The last time such a thing happened , The resulting war of the nines shook the entire quad . - So , you want my team to escort the surrogate to qresh , So the heir can inherit the child 's lands and title ? - My ancestors began the vessel program , And our line continue to be its patrons . Some want the lahani heir protected , Some want him dead . I must appear to be non-partisan , So i need this done cleanly . Quietly . And no one can know i was ever involved . - Discretion is my team 's specialty . - Good . A less discrete person might ask why a lowborn killjoy Possesses an instrument Reserved for female royalty in other parts of the j . - Came with the ship . One question , My lady- - to come all this way personally ... Why the sudden urgency ? Where is the baby ? - We have no idea . - [ approaching westerley . Initiating descent . ] - D-eight-seven-two-two-nine . - [ congratulations on receiving your reclamation agent certificate , level four , ] [ d 'avin jaqobis . ] - well , thank you ... Ship . Now i need to find someone . - [ name input ? ] - Dr. Pim jaegar . - [ searching ... ] ( alert signal ) - shit . - Yeah . It 's pretty annoying . - Dammit , john . What did you do ? - Changed mainframe search parameters to alert me in case of breach . ( alert signal stops ) You 're the breach . - You set a trap for me ? - You say tomato , I say that 's what you get for not confiding in your brother . So it 's true . Who is she ? - An army doc . All i know is ... She 's in the quad . - She 's why you 're here . - John- - - Look , d 'av , whatever . Point is , i 'm a killjoy . Finding people is literally what i do , And you won 't even tell me who you 're looking for ? That 's bullshit . - So , that delle seyah seemed like a piece of work , huh ? - I just wish you 'd told me first , instead of dutch . - Some things are easier To tell a stranger than your little brother . I got my head a bit scrambled during my last combat mission . I think this doctor can help . That 's it . Don 't make a deal . I can handle this on my own , ok ? - Boys ? With me . - [ docking at westerley . ] - What do you mean , they lost the baby ? How do you lose a baby ? - Right ? I 've met babies . They 're very slow . - Are you done ? Our baby has not been born yet . The target is a surrogate . The monastery where she was living Is cloistered . No men in , no girls out . But the abbess has sent daily health reports to the nine . Last week , the monastery went dark . Delle seyah sent her people To investigate . - Damn . And our target ? - Missing . The remaining sisters have all gone underground . They won 't even reply to the nine . - If she won 't talk to her employers , Then how are we supposed to find her ? - With a little help from our friends . ¶ ¶ ¶ - Where 's your i.D. , scarback ? - Enjoying your work , officer ? I 'll be praying for you tonight . And your family . - Keep sassing them , and one day i 'll be bailing your ass from jail . - Company punks ? They 're too scared of my kind . You look well . - I feel well . - I 'm great too , by the way . - Is that the new one ? - Yeah , i 'm the new one . Nice cape . - So , Any news on the monastery massacre ? - One survivor . The abbess . My people have been in touch with her . She says to tell you the girl is safe . Girl 's name is constance . Once the abbess heard She was carrying the last of the lahani line , she moved her . - Moved her where ? - Safe house . Only the abbess and one other sister know the location . This will get you to the safe house . The abbess has one condition . Trust no one , tell no one , until the girl is safe on qreshi soil . - I know how to do my job , alvis . - I 'm just doing mine . - Hang on . These coordinates can 't be right . - Why ? Where are we heading ? I love the badlands ! - Just admit it , john , we 're lost . - I don 't get lost . Coordinates say this is the location . - Except it isn 't . - This is our fourth jaunt past that cliff-face . And the perfect chance To enjoy a refreshing beverage . - So why can 't we just fly in ? - ' cause we can 't take lucy this deep . The sand here , It reflects electromagnetics ; it fries the navs , whatever . Besides , wasn 't that fun ? - Let me simplify , rookie : Bad air make ship go boom . Badlands are what the company leaves behind After they strip an area bare . - Hell of a place to hide a baby maker for blue bloods . - Clever . Nobody 'll think to look In the most toxic place in the quad . - Hey . Does that horizon look hinky ? - Whoa , easy with the technical terms . - He 's right . There 's no lichen growing on the escarpment , even though it faces south . Security projection . Nice eye . Johnny ! - You should see you guys ' faces . - What 's back there ? - Just more badlands . Come on . Oh , and a giant fortress . Get the rambler ! - Nice place for a safe house . - Unless it 's just another trick . Some tech-mirage ? - With a front door ? - Time to ring the doorbell . - Ladies first . - Rarely , in my experience . - Then they 're doing it wrong . - I 'll be the lady . - Yes , ma 'am . - Moment of truth . - This is a bad time to discover i 'm claustrophobic . Sure hope they built this place to code . - Shh . This could be an ambush , look alive . Here they are . ( women gasping ) - This is officially my favorite ambush ever . - It 's ok . We 're here to help . - Are you here to take us to qresh ? - Which one of you is constance ? - I am . - Nuns . - With guns . - That 's different . Easy , sisters . - I knew Leith 's silence was a portent . - You 're scaring the girls . Let us explain- - - Shut up . - What are you doing ! - They 're not here to rescue us . They 're here to execute you . - Put down the guns . We work for the rack , We have a warrant- - - that 's bullshit . - Drop ' em ! You want an act of faith ? Here 's one . I haven 't killed you yet . The abbess sent us . We 're here to extract the surrogate immediately . - What 's wrong with her ? - She 's eight months pregnant . Sister therese . Take constance to her room , Then check the perimeter . You- - - dutch . - Tell me about the others on leith . Ladies , be kind to these rakes ! Apparently , they 're our honored guests . - Well , this should go well . - Everyone at the birthing sanctuary ? - Except the abbess . - I could have been there when they attacked . I could have been killed . - There 's a chance That whoever did it is heading here now . We need to evacuate . - Right now ? No , constance is on bed rest . She took a turn for the worse when transferring here . Aren 't we all safer in here , anyway ? - My team 's job is to transport people . We 're very good at it . I can keep constance safe . - Their tracks continue through here . Get the gear ! - So you 're brothers ? - Yup . - I love brothers . Do you guys like Being killjoys ? And flying around and stuff ? - Totally . Stuff is great . - It 's feeding time In the lions ' den . And you 're the meat . - No , you 're wrong ! Please , she has to stabilize or she could go Into labor . - So stabilize her . - Projection camouflage ; hermetically sealed from the elements ; Shock-shielding on perimeter . All the precautions have been taken . The danger is out there . In here , we are perfectly safe ! ( rumbling sound ) ( alert signal ) - you were saying ? Rity : Disabled . Air purifiers : Compromised . ] - What 's going on ? - I bet a bird flew into the grid again . Sister therese is outside , Patrolling the perimeter . There 's no need to panic . - Get the girls to a more secure place . Check on constance . Lock her down . - Ok , ladies , let 's get lower where it 's nice and cool ... - I 'll monitor the grid . See if i can boot it up internally- - - you can . Well , i can . - Then you 'd better come along . - You go with the girls . I 'll sweep . - Hey . Don 't you think it 'd be better if , you know , you stayed with them ? - Why , because i have breasts ? - Sorta ? Wait , is that like a trick question ? - They like you , ok ? You 're a big ... Muscle-y distraction , and we need that right now . Look , our warrant is for constance , remember ? And when it comes down to it , she 's the one we need to save . How do you think the others will react when they figure that bit out ? - No idea . Neither do you . - Trust me , i know . I grew up in a place just like this . - You grew up in a fertility cult ? - Ok , not exactly like this ; What you 'd probably call a " royal harem " . Long story , another time . Here 's how it works : Treat people like chattel , Make them fight for approval , and they will always turn On one another in the end . You 've seen them . They 're basically brainwashed . - And probably really , really scared . ( scoffing ) not everybody is as hard as you , dutch . - I didn 't start out this way . - Someone 's patched this together with fusion gel and duct tape . - Unconventional . - It 's impressive . - Improvised . - It was you ? - I was re-routing harvest drones to terrorize my sisters when i was knee-high To a coptor pod . - And now you 're a surrogate for qreshi nobles who can 't , Or won 't , make their own babies . How 's that happen ? - Constance , clara , gwen : We 're all daughters of farmers on leith who didn 't need any more daughters . This is how we serve our families . - Constance ? Hi , i 'm dutch- - - The lady killjoy . I 'd get up , but ... - I know you 're not very well , But we really need to leave . Now . - I 'm ready . I may be weak , but this baby is very strong . These days , i feel him moving a lot . But he has to wait . The lahani heir is only legitimate if he 's born On qreshi ... Soil . Am i boring you ? - Sorry . Evaluating security . Part of my job . - Yes , and listening to me Wax poetic about my vow of bounty , isn 't . I get it . - Your beliefs are none of my business . - I 'm the only one of the girls That was able to conceive this round . - That 's great . - No , i- - I need to see it through . That 's not faith , it 's fact . - Oh . You need a dirk . - You 're bossy . You 're also right . - So we all took and passed The purity test together . It takes a lot of sacrifices to be fit for service . No booze , no boys , No flesh . Not even bacon . - No room for a career . No chance to build your own coptor pods . Why ? - Traditions die hard . You know the old joke , " what do you get when you scratch a leithian " ? - What ? - A qreshi ancestor who 's embarrassed to be there . We 're all descendants of some qreshi-fourth-or-fifth-son , Sent to leith when land got scarce . Some see honor in keeping that connection alive . - So , what do you get when you scratch a westerlyn ? - Scabies ? Sorry ! - It 's ok , we just dock there . - Anyway . My family gets paid three times for my ' honor What i 'd make as an engineer , so ... - Maybe you 're underestimating how good an engineer you could 've been . - I 've thought about it . Look , those girls Are my real family now . I 'd do anything for them . Please don 't tell them That i ... Sometimes have doubts . - Not even if they bribe me with bacon . - Where have you been ? I told you to stay with her . - I know how to protect my girls , i 've been doing it For twenty-three years , missy . ( rumbling sound ) - Did you bring someone up with you ? Stay with constance . For real this time . Lock the doors . I 'll be right back . And i mean now . - I always wanted a big brother . You two close ? - We used to be . Now it 's all his secrets hiding from my secrets . - Your secrets ? We just met And i know your blood type and why you don 't like pie . - Be cake or be pudding , but commit . - Why yes , i 'd love to dance . Oh , you like to lead ? So do i . - I think there 's something really wrong . Look , a short this size Is only possible if the surge was external . Big . Deliberate . - Not a bird ? - More like a satellite . I can override the system , but ... - Who sent you ? Leith nationalists , or the nine ? ( system powering on ) - You are a special snowflake , john jaqobis . We weren 't down for long . - By my count , eleven minutes without security . That 's long enough . - For what ? - For whoever cut the power to get inside . - Whoever 's paying , we 'll double it . - Go to hell , wester-slag . - The nine it is . Thanks . - Dutch , you ok ? - [ all we want is the lahani breeder . ] [ send her outside and no one else will die . ] - No one else ? Sister therese ! ( gunshot ) ( sobbing ) - [ leithian breeder , i 'm coming for you . ] - Mercenaries ? - I offered him more money . A true merc would have at least heard me out . Look at his hands , His gear . This is pure qreshi house guard in disguise . - No colors , no crests- - - so no way to tell Which of the nine families he was working for . Great . ( women bickering ) And , next stop : Hair pulling . - Ladies ! Hey ! What the hell am i watching ? Clara , let her go . Jenny , put on your damn shoe . And you ... Sobbing helps exactly zero percent . - He knows their names ? - Sorry , d 'avin . - Apology accepted , clara . Now go get constance . - He knows their names . - Hey . Can we get to your ship already ? - It 's parked a few miles away . - Through the badlands ? No . Surrogates can 't breathe westerlyn air . It will negate constance 's status . - So will dying . - We can get halfway there through the tunnels . - Her room is empty ! - Stop ! - I 'm sorry , constance . I am . But if the brigands get in here , It 's rape and murder for everyone . They shot sister therese in the head ! - I never took you for a coward . - Cowards survive . Eight failed implantations , Living off the crumbs of charity . I 've given enough to bounty . Playing brood mare to qreshis isn 't a ' higher calling ' . That 's just a story we tell idiot girls like you To get control of your wombs . - Shut your mouth ! - I knew someone would go full bitch . Just didn 't think it 'd be mother inferior . - If we give them the girl , The rest of us stand a chance . It 's triage . It 's fair . - It 's pathetic . Let go of the girl . - I won 't risk my life for this baby . - I will . ( gasping ) - Ok . Look at me . Just breathe . Just breathe . Look at me . Ok . - What do you care ? You haven 't stopped judging us since the moment you got here . You think we 're stupid ? - No . I think you 're really brave . But you have been manipulated . I know what that 's like , and i 'm not going to do that to you now . Forget the bounty , forget the nine . What do you want ? - I 'm not a quitter . I--i- - I promised the lahanis that i would continue their line- - - constance . - Don 't patronize me ! Being a vessel is my calling . It matters to me . Mother sal doesn 't get a say in that , and neither do you . - Ok . Good . - I want to finish this . For the baby , and for me . Will you help us ? - I 'm no quitter either . But can 't make any promises about your baby blanket . ( loud clanging ) They 're coming through the doors . - How many do you figure are out there ? - A few more than us , probably better armed . - Says who ? ( whistling ) - damn , girl . - Pass me the flash rifle . Clara , take the mags . - My kind of girls . - Is that a flamethrower ? - You sure you can handle your weapons ? - Please . We 're country girls from leith . We learned how to fire a rifle before we learned to thresh . - Ok . Let 's do this . Alright , listen up ! We need your help covering us through the tunnels , In case we 're not alone in there . Once we get to the door , you reseal it , And sit tight . - We 're not leaving constance . - This is their baby , too . They 're coming . - Looks like it 's all for one ... And one for me . - Alright , Let 's go . - Sure you wouldn 't rather just carry the hammer ? - Cute . But i think i 'm gonna stick with my plasma grenades . - I get it . Respect the classics . - John ... Thanks . - Stay close , ok ? ( screaming ) - constance ! - Hey , we need to keep moving . - Her pulse is faint ; Heartbeat 's erratic ! - Deep breaths , mama . - Why didn 't he kill me ? - They must need you alive . Guardians of royal children Control their lands . Maybe that 's why they want the baby . - Steal the kid , Steal the land ? - That only works if the baby lives . - Put me in front . I can act as a shield for the others . - You 're too weak . - Let 's move , people ! Now ! - I have a synthesized adrenaline shot . I stole it from the matron 's cabinet . - What will that do to the baby ? - Keep me alive long enough to get to qresh ? - Incoming ! - Is it working ? - Oh yeah . Come on . ¶ ¶ ¶ - ¶ let 's go ! ¶ - Constance ! What do we do now ? - I 'll lay cover . Clear a path to the rambler ! - We 'll bring up the rear . So move your pregnant ass . - Move it ! Clara , watch your back ! - They shot sarah ! - Johnny , on your left ! - My left or a normal person 's left ? - Jakkhole . - ¶ let 's go ! ¶ - Shit ! He shanked the coupler . - I 'm down to my quarter tank of petrol- - ( screaming ) - oh , my god ! Gwen ! They got gwen ! - Running low on ammo ! - You 'll need two minutes to reboot . - We don 't have two minutes ! - I 'll buy them for you . Just promise me you 're gonna get these girls back home . - No . No ! Jenny , it 's not worth it ! - Of course it is . They 're my sisters . - Stop ! - Jenny ! - No ! - Jenny ! What are you doing ! ? Jenny , come back ! - It 's the breeder . Hold your fire . - Jenny ! ( screaming ) - Constance , you 're ok . I 'm sorry about your friends . Just hang in there . - I can 't anymore ... - Yes , you can . Don 't quit now . You 've been so brave- - - you 're not listening to me . I 'm having this baby . Now ! - [ initiating launch . ] - Johnny ? Get us the hell out of here . We need to get to qresh . Ped for this situation . Can you reschedule ? ] - Use your anger . It 's just pain . - Then you do it ! - Where are we at ? - Contractions are getting closer together . - Is that ... Good ? - We don 't do this part . They take us To the best doctors on qresh . - We should take her to old town , it 's closer . - No ! The baby has to be born on qresh to claim his lahani birthright . If we fail , then all of that was for nothing . They all just died for nothing . We have to try . - We 'll do more than try . - [ dutch ! ] I need a word . - I got this . - Status ? - Royally forked . Emphasis on ' royal ' . I 'm not getting a landing code . And now being denied airspace access full stop . - Delle seyah revoked our clearance ? - Why would she do that ? - Court politics are a bitch . But so am i . Lucy , get me delle seyah . - [ contacting . ] - Excuse me . Didn 't think i 'd hear from you . - We 're in stratosphere , i have the ... Cargo on board , but we 're being denied entry . - [ one of the other nine must be blocking you . I can 't help with that . ] - [ lady , we need to land . ] - and i needed discretion . Instead , the other families are gossiping about dead vessels in the desert , And you want to connect me to that ? This plan is no longer viable . - [ and this baby 's about to be " viable " in the hold of my ship ! ] - [ not on qreshi soil , and therefore not a trueborn nine . ] [ i have no obligation to a random baby . ] - Who made the better offer ? Which family bought you out ? - [ there are delicate politics at play here you could not ] [ begin to understand , so let me say it simply : ] You failed me , killjoy . [ i will not soon forget it . ] - We 're going in . - Dutch . There 's bending the law and then there 's breaking it . - Shields still at 90 % . ( sighing ) - We are talking about going up against the nine . Against delle seyah . She could have us staked in black rain , dutch . And by the time she 's done with us , we might be begging to be . - If she didn 't want us to finish the job , she shouldn 't have hired me . And the last thing she wants is publicity . Constance , two more minutes . Let that baby know who 's boss . And hold on . - [ john , we have company ships on our tail . ] - [ hailing . ] [ you have unlawfully entered qreshi airspace and will be shot down ] [ if you do not pull up . Do not attempt to land . ] [ we will execute with impunity . ] - I 'd respectfully hold on that , border patrol . We are rack agents With an active warrant . This must be some sort of mistake . We 're disabling our weaponry . Let 's figure this out . - You , come with me ! Secure the perimeter ! ( baby crying ) - [ bio still in cargo bay . ] ( baby crying ) - I 'll have a look . I 'm sure everything is fine . - You were told not to land . My lady was very clear . - We have a valid rack warrant . - Which is why your ship is still intact . Get back on board Or i 'll splatter this grass with gray matter . - That 's a bit extreme . - I liked it . Felt like it came from a real place . We 're just here to drop off some precious cargo . Delle seyah kendry , Of land kendry : May i introduce The latest qreshi citizen . ( baby crying ) Trueborn , on mother soil . Your soil . Thanks to you , the lahani line lives on . - Praise the trees . The nine are whole again . Welcome home , little one . I 've overlooked that the surrogates breathed polluted westerley air . As far as everyone else knows , the girls remain 100 % pure . - Well , i imagine that 's to your advantage , Now that you 're the heir 's legal guardian . - You , uh , You made me a few enemies tonight . Reckless move , forcing my hand . - Not really . " when your enemy has two faces , Strike a deal with both . " ( chuckling ) - You can 't be serious . You 've read derhlek ? - Only the simple words . - Well , go on then . Amuse me , killjoy . What are my two faces ? - By my count ? You 're a decent person genuinely trying To protect the surrogates . - Or ? - A ruthless politician , Who either used me to find the girls so that you could attack them , Or cut a deal with the persons who did . - What 's your bet ? - Even odds . But i can make either work . If you are a decent person , The baby is safe . - And if i 'm a scheming opportunist ? - He 's even safer . Qreshis can 't bequeath land until they turn eighteen , And you 've no claim to his without him . So , good or evil , It 's now in your best interest To do everything in your power to keep him safe . - Well , Aren 't you a pearl hiding in the muck . - Thank you ? - It 's a compliment . You have an unusual grasp of statecraft , For a woman with calloused hands . I could use someone of your complexity . Now get off my property Before i have you shot . Oh , i like her . Find out everything you can . - That was the most painful , Terrifying experience of my life . Why can 't i stop staring at his fingernails ? - I 've heard they 've asked you to stay on , as his nanny . - I always hoped they would . He was never really mine , but i hoped i would stay in his life , Teach him about my home . Help raise a qreshi leader who understands leith . - There 's certainly time . - I need you to take clara and i home . - Your farm ? - No . That 's not my home anymore . - Don 't say you 're staying a vessel . - No . A guardian . Coach other girls through this honor . - You know it 's not honor . - It 's whatever we make of it . - You asked me to figure out what i want ? This is what i want . Someone has to protect the vessels , for as long as the girls Are called to serve . And after everything they gave up for me , How can i abandon my sisters ? - They 'll be lucky to have you . You ready ? - No . - Girls are finally asleep . Algae brew ? - She was on qresh . In the capital city . Madidus . - Who ? - Dr. Jaegar . - " was " ? - There 's no sign of her After she stepped off the transport that brought her to this system . But someone , They paid significant joy for a solid cleanup job . - So that 's it ? - Well , she 'll have left a trail , a clue . I mean , they always do . - I didn 't ask for your help , john . - Yeah , but you should have , dipshit . I 'm your brother . This doc , can she- - Can she fix you ? - I don 't know . Maybe . - Ok , so then We search , we find out . But dutch has to be in on it . She 's family , too . - Ok . - Meaning , don 't plow our sister . - Remind me : Was that on the jaqobis family crest ? - I 've seen how you look at her . D 'av , this is almost working . We are a good team . We could be great . So don 't mess that up for us . - I won 't . I promise . - Promise what ? - That next time , i get to pick the damn warrant . - I , um , gotta go do a thing . I don 't know exactly what happened to you in that ... Rich kid orphanage of yours , But you came out the other side clean . Don 't ever think otherwise . ¶ ¶ ¶ - ¶ let 's go ! ¶ D c captioning g by sette incnc .

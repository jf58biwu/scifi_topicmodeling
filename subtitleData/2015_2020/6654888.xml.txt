This Highlander who had run afoul of a redcoat patrol was only the latest one . The rebellion Jamie and I had labored so hard to prevent was upon us . Our only hope was that somehow we could change the outcome . I feared in my heart that history would not be rewritten . victory would remain forever out of reach . how long do you need to take a simple pish ? I 'll be right there . How many men had I seen killed in war ? ♪ far too many . sir . Right there is your enemy . Yet we do nothing but sit here and twiddle our thumbs . John ? Quartermaster O 'Sullivan . damn it . I cannot understand why General Murray insists we waste our time in dilly-dally . I rushed the army here to ensure our possession of the high ground . And now you wish us to abandon such a strong defensive position and attack the enemy in force ? sir . sir . Time is of the essence . Your Majesty . We must strike and strike hard . May I remind the Quartermaster through Tranent Meadows . Though " meadow " is a fancy name for the bog that lies between us and the enemy . Since when did a Scotsman huh ? Especially when there 's an enemy waiting for him on the other side . Since when does an Irish-born officer dismiss the dangers of boggy ground to an infantry attack ? at last . Sire ? Your army wallowing helplessly while under a withering volley from the British Brown Bess musket ? A weapon deadly at 50 yards and accurate up to 100 . Cavalry could prove useful to our needs . Both to test the ground and to report on the enemy position . a braw squad of dragoons could mean the difference between victory and defeat . Let us not speak of defeat or of cavalry we do not have . may I remind him and therefore need not be concerned about British marksmanship . sir ? sir . I 'm merely grateful that we are dependent upon the bravery of our warriors ... here ! Who are not afraid to face shot or shell to pursue a glorious victory for our prince and for our king . now it is but weeks gone since we took the cities of Perth and Edinburgh without firing a single shot . they welcomed me with open arms . but on both occasions Your Royal Highness . General Cope wasna expecting us . His troops fled . Sir . Perhaps if I were to arrange a meeting with the General ? Offer him generous terms of surrender . Give him my word his men will be allowed to march back to England unmolested . I am sure he has no more desire to shed English blood than I have . We are all brothers after all . Even as a young lad Sir . But I fear the time for talk is done . We sailed from France to fight a war . Let us fight ... and be done with it . I will not risk destroying our army ... by ordering it to cross potentially lethal ground . sir ? I will not allow it . Then resign your commission and let the prince find himself a general with a firmer backbone ! You pompous toe-rag ! what do I tell Clan MacDonald ? Tell your men to await further orders . Which may be some time . Why must the Scots be such intractable people ? we can be pig-headed on occasion . On many an occasion . I fear . James . and I have promised God . Mark me . Your noble wife will be among those providing medical succor for those poor souls in need of such come the cannon 's roar ? she 's helping to set up a field hospital Your Royal Highness . Be so kind to tell her the prince asks that British casualties be tended to before the Jacobite wounded . and I will have them well cared for . They must be made to realize the Scots wage war upon them with the greatest of reluctance . but one day soon they will be our friends again . I 'm afraid the British have never been a friend to the Scots . I would advise you not to speak of such things within earshot of the men . They would not appreciate such sentiment . Nor do I believe would my wife follow such an order . perhaps not . But surely Lady Broch Tuarach would prove obedient to an edict from her lord and master . Aye . ♪ Enough ! ye say ? all right . I heard it with these very ears . The ale ye waste now is ale ye 'll probably be wanting later . Quench the thirst of battle . ye say ? eh ? same as you . For gore and glory . is it ? but men . And they 'll be looking to do the same to you . and we 'll do what needs doing to return the king across the water . Will ye now ? I bet ye Lallybroch tumshies will turn arse and run at first blast of cannon fire . ye buggering wee shite ! ye fancy a doing ? I 'll open ye from yer belly to yer bone ! Put that blade down or I 'll ram it up yer arse until ye taste it . ye bushy-faced whoreson ! how can a man nap with all this blathering ? Is that a dirk I see in yer hand ? Angus . See yer getting on as well as our commanders . Jamie ? No . Nor are we likely to while the general and O 'Sullivan remain hopping mad at each other . It sounds like someone in the front ranks eh ? If only that was all was needed . What is required is a reconnaissance of the marshland that sits between us and the British camp . Discover if the ground is solid enough for our army to cross . So the plan is for us to attack ? If the Quartermaster has his way . Though I 'm of a mind it 's the better part of valor to force the British to come to us . But not even O 'Sullivan will countenance an attack until the question of the ground is solved . To undertake such a mission under the very guns of our enemies will be naught but suicide . eat yer fill and rest up . Save the whisky for when we have cause to celebrate . a word . It would be an easy thing to have someone ride out to take a measure of the marshland ? And get a musket ball between the eyes for their trouble . Not if he 's prudent . And lucky . There 's no other way about it . it can support infantry . is it yerself ye 're nominating ? the prince would have yer head for endangering the life of one of his most trusted aides . Hmm . Aye . He would not be best pleased . No . someone has to risk the doing . And all I need to do is stay out of range of their guns . 125 yards should do it . I was thinking more 105 . The redcoats will only be too happy to crack away breathing target . but it 's worth the risk . I 'd like to prove my mettle to the prince and Lord Murray and the rest of these jackanapes . 125 yards ? Or thereabouts . ♪ look . men . to ranks . Load . Extraordinary fellow . That 's Dougal MacKenzie . Personal friend of mine . You are ? Charles Edward Stuart . Are ye really ? Ye hear that ? I 'm talking to the prince . - Your Royal Highness . - Quite so . boy . Fire at will ! ♪ - Fire ! - Come on . lads . I think we 've learned all we need to know . Quite enough . ♪ Surrender . Bravo ! Bravo ! this war would be over tomorrow . but I fear that it 's joyless news that I bring back with me . Indeed . there will be no glorious Highland charge through Tranent Meadows . and they can 't get to us . We should disengage from the enemy under cover of darkness and return to Edinburgh . And wait for the British to lay siege to the city ? not in Edinburgh . I look to you to break this stalemate or I will be forced to find myself a new general . ♪ Ye 're a lucky bastard . Ye should get that looked at . Either way . It 's just a scratch . I 'm off to change my breeks because the hero of the hour has shat his pants . apparently your Doctor MacPherson left Tranent a few days ago . he left his medical bag behind . more useful than the doctor himself probably would have . it is up to us to tend to the wounded . And I have no doubt that together we will be able to do it . you 're a strong girl . your job is to see to it that the pails and buckets are filled at all times . And use water from the well only .

I 've lived in these parts all my life . so I ken the grounds where the armies are like the back of my hand . There 's a way down from the ridge where the Highland troops are . hidden trail that will lead them past the bog at the bottom to catch the English unawares . - I see . - If I may speak perhaps Lord Murray himself . do you think you can find your master ? I-I will find him . but be careful . Tell him to come back straightaway to speak with Mr. Anderson . you say ? Aye . Or thereabouts . I don 't ken much from maps . There 's no such path marked . it 's there . and hopeless to find in the dark . Unless ye ken where to look . And you do ? I do . Fortune drops out of the sky and onto our doorstep . is it not ? If we dare trust this boy . And ye 're willing to lead us across the meadows ? There 's no other way for it . but I 'll get ye from here to there without a misstep . Mr. Anderson . Your help is much appreciated . I do wish that John was here . I pray I might hear his opinion . And I pray the Quartermaster is off somewhere gathering much needed victuals for this army . Your Royal Highness . ♪ gentlemen . Now we shall not return unless we bring victory back with us . it would ease me greatly to know that you 'll watch over Bess and the croft . if it proves necessary . My Marina and the six bairns ?

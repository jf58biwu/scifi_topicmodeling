 Bellamy : We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabitable , but they were wrong , and we 've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , but most of us are still here , searching for other survivors from the Ark , trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness ... a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , we need to make peace with the Grounders , but peace is a foreign concept here . Jaha : I found it , John . The City of Light is real . I can tell you about the City of Light , but you won 't understand until you experience it yourself . Clarke : I 'm not going in . Just gonna remind me of what I did to get them here . _ Indra : Clarke , she 's being hunted . - By who ? - By everyone . Monty : A tracking beacon from the Ark ... Farm Station . - That 's the beacon . - This belongs to us . Indra : The Ice Nation queen wants Clarke 's power . If her people know she has it , she 'll break the coalition and start a war . Bellamy : It 's been 3 hours . What are they waiting for ? Even with the light , I don 't see anyone . I say we make a run for it . Kane : No . That 's what they want us to do . Indra : The boy is right . They can wait longer than we can . Kane : Ok , Bellamy . Get in the turret , and you cover us . Once we get to that ridge over there , we 'll cover you . Copy that . Run fast . They 're here . Man : Everybody out , or the boy dies . Hey , hey ! Ok ! Ok . We 're coming out . Don 't hurt him . All targets secure . [ Beeping ] Found it . It 's mine . Give it back ! Monty , let it go . Monty ? Mom ? Jaha : I still can 't believe how beautiful it is . It 's perfect . In the City of Light , mankind will finally be free of pain and hate and disease . Here , there will be no more suffering . I 'll fill this place , starting with my people . You have my word . I believe in you , Thelonious . Together , we will save the human race . Murphy : Earth to Jaha . Come in , Jaha . Yes , John ? Hate to break up your little zen nap , but we 're here . - Already ? - Yeah . A lot faster with a motor . Easy . I was just trying to help . Murphy : As I recall , the last time you helped , two of my friends blew up . No minefield this time . We go around the Dead Zone . Jaha : Let 's get a move on , you two . Emori : Right behind you . We head west towards that rise . Murphy : You know , this whole helpful guide act , I 'm not really buying it . Then I guess you 're just gonna have to keep an eye on me . I knew it . [ Both crying ] Farm Station , stand down . Pike ? You have no idea how good it is to see you . Kane : We didn 't think you made it . Lacroix , Smith , watch our 6 . Yes , sir . Everyone else , I said , stand down . Man : Yes , sir . Where 's Dad ? Father didn 't make it . How many of you are there ? 63 . The rest are camped in the mountains north of here , Grounder killers one and all . - Am I right ? - Ooh rah ! Bellamy : Hate to cut this short . We got to find Clarke . Clarke Griffin ? Yeah . If only all of my Earth skills students were as good as her . It 's good to see you , sir . Yeah . You , too . Ok . Move the tree . Help them . I 'll be right back . You ok ? I have to be . Man : Now come on . Push ! Kane : 63 ? Farm Station left orbit with 3 times that number . We landed with that number , too . The Ice Nation can be ruthless . Take pride in the number you saved . Indra , this is Charles Pike . He was a teacher on the Ark . This is Indra . She 's leader of Trikru and a trusted ally . I 'll have to take your word for it . Kane , it 's time to go . Kane : Monty , give them the coordinates to Arkadia . We have a settlement 50 miles south of here . Your people will be safe there . You 're my people . Good , because we have reports that put Clarke north of here . We could certainly use your expertise . If she 's in the Ice Nation , you 're gonna need more than that . We leave no one behind . Lacroix , take the team . Rendezvous with the others . Get them to Arkadia . Hannah : I 'm staying with my son . Damn right , you are . Mount up . We 're going back into hell . On your feet . Looks like the great Wanheda is human , after all . [ Both grunting ] [ Panting ] Now that 's better . You 're Ice Nation . [ Birds chirping ] Smart move , leaving that guard jacket inside . - Fighter approaching . - Where ? Man : Outside pole 20 . The kill order . We have to get you inside the wall . Here . Nyko . Lincoln , be careful . Lincoln : Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold your fire ! Come on . Abby . I need Abby . We 'll take you to her . _ _ Generally , a follow-up appointment is about checking the old injury , not treating new ones . I was trying to make the most of our time together , Doc . Can we talk about this one ? You said I was fine . I understand how much Maya meant to you . What is it you want to talk about , how dead she still is ? Jasper , you 're never gonna move past this unless you face your feelings head on . Your friend Finn , he never did that , and it broke him . I don 't want that happening to you . Your daughter killed him , too . Octavia : Abby , Abby , it 's Nyko . Lincoln : He said it was Azgeda , the Ice Nation . - Where ? - We don 't know . Jackson : His pulse is weak , and he 's burning up . Abby : Clotting has stopped the flow , but he 's lost too much blood . I 'll type him . [ Beep beep ] Rh null . What 's wrong ? We 're universal donors . - Here . Take mine . - No . You can 't . Rh null can only take Rh null . [ Beep ] Well , I don 't understand . Can you save him or not ? - Not here . - Jackson ... Wait . What 's he talking about ? I 'm talking about Mount Weather . The medical facility in that mountain is state-of-the-art . They relied on blood to survive . It 's still all there . Abby : You want me to bring a Grounder into Mount Weather for a transfusion ? They killed thousands of people for that blood , Jackson . We can 't just let him die , Abby . We 're doctors . - I am not just a doctor . - Maybe you should be . Lincoln , you said to me yesterday that even our supply runs were putting us at risk . They were jeopardizing our peace . Yeah . How would you advise me now ? Lincoln ... He 's my friend . Save him . Get him ready for transport . I hope you 're ready to face your feelings . [ Crash ] _ _ _ _ _ [ gunshot ] Bellamy : Are you ok ? You all right ? Bounty hunter . _ - English . - Pike , go outside . Take Monty and Hannah . Search the perimeter . Make sure he was alone . _ So was he . Please . She 's in danger . You 're Skaikru ? Yeah . She was here last night . Did she say where she was going ? No . She was here when I fell asleep and gone when I woke up . She give you any indication of where she might go ? No ... but he did . He said that his partner came back for her . He was Ice Nation . - I hope you find her . - Thank you . Good news . I found fresh tracks . Great . Start the rover . That 's the bad news ... too many trees . We have to go on foot . Quiet . Ice Nation scouts . Come on . We backtrack . Then we go around . Their deaths are on you . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Didn 't have to be this way . If you were gonna kill me , you would 've done it already . There 's still time . Voice : Arrive level 3 . - How you holding up ? - Don 't worry about me . Just get the blood . I 'll prep him . Don 't do anything stupid . You mean like coming back here ? You haven 't told me what happened to Dad . All you father wanted was to find you . He loved you . That 's what matters . Ask you a question ? Last report we got on the Ark , you were under attack by Grounders . What changed ? Well , it turns out , we had a common enemy . What happened to them ? - We won . - Quiet . [ Distant drums playing ] Listen . War drums . Azgeda . You can tell it 's Ice Nation from the sound ? No , from them . Pike : We need to get those bodies off the field unless you 're good with them thinking we did this . Go . Hurry . Bellamy : Wait . Two people at 12 o 'clock . [ Drums and shouting ] It 's Clarke . - Hey , hey , hey ! Ho ! - Get out of my way . - You 'll never make it in time . - He 's right . Look . No way we get across without being seen . We should lay low , let the army pass . Then we find Clarke . Guys , there 's a cave . We just got lucky . Come on . - I can 't go with you . - Why ? Ice Nation has crossed the border . They 're marching against my commander . I have to warn her . - We 'll get Clarke . - You better . The Ice Queen gets her first , she 'll be dead , and we 'll be at war . [ Drums and shouting continue ] Scream again , and we 'll both be dead . Hey ... You really been to the City of Light ? Shut up , Otan . I 'm not listening to that skrish again . Come . Walk with me . Murphy : Thank God he 's got somebody else to preach to now , huh ? Not a believer ? I believe you 're here for a reason . Just don 't know what it is yet . We were recruited . Recruited by who ? I don 't know her name . She comes to us in the flying machine . You mean the drone . Yeah . That 's how she found us , too . So what do you do for her ? We collect tech . You mean steal it . When we have to . We bring it to the island , to him . That 's how we survive . This time , she said they needed a ride . What are you doing ? Don 't try to be a hero , and I 'll leave you on your feet this time . Oh , a hero ? And here , I thought you got me . Come on . Really , are you about to steal from the people you steal for ? Shh . We have other buyers . Now be quiet . Bad idea . Murphy : Ok . Oh , easy , easy . Hey , come on . Hey , big fella , come on . There 's no harm done , all right ? Just put her down . Just put her down , all right ? There is no pain in the City of Light . [ Emori gagging ] You coming , or what ? [ Distant drums and shouting ] Another inch , and I 'd be dead . Maybe you 're not the Commander of Death , after all . Now she 's quiet . Why are you hiding from your own people ? Why 'd you run away from yours ? [ Sizzling ] The great Wanheda ... Mountain slayer . I 'm no one . Lot of people out there right now looking for no one . You 're obviously not loyal to the Ice Nation , so why are you taking me there ? Look . Whatever the Ice Queen is giving you , my people will offer you more . Doubt that , not for someone who abandoned them . You don 't know anything about me . I know you took the coward 's way out . Like you 're so different ? You 're in disguise , same as me . You 're on the run , same as me , in the wilderness , same as me . I was banished , nothing like you . You had a choice , and , no , I can 't take you home to your people ... Because you 're the way back home to mine . - We 're losing her . - Relax . Save your energy . Kane 's right , son . The army will move soon . You 'll need your strength for what comes next . I need to know what happened . Monty ... Please . We landed in the snow . Your father said it absorbed some of the impact . That 's why we survived . The snow looked so beautiful , it ... Hannah : Charles ? The children were playing in it . They were the first to die ... 15 of them . If not for your father , would 've been more . He pulled 4 kids back into the ship , all 4 alive today . They got him when he went back for the fifth . Your father died a hero , Monty . [ Sniffles ] We 've been fighting Grounders ever since . That was the Ice Nation . Not all Grounders are the same . They are to me . Emori : As soon as Otan gets here , we can leave . Partners in crime , huh ? Whatever 's in there , we 'll split it 3 ways . You earned that . Yeah , and all we had to do was kill a guy . [ Kiss ] Thank you for saving my life . Let me . [ Hiss ] I could 've done that . Ah , now , that 's tech . Murphy : It 's more than just tech . Stupid son of a bitch brought her with him . Brought who with him ? Took you long enough . You shouldn 't have opened that . We needed to see what we had . Check it out . You 're not wearing your scarf . [ Beep beep ] How 'd you know how to do that ? Give me the backpack , John . Heh . No . Easy.Easy , easy ... come on . Easy . What are you doing ? Otan , let me go . Doesn 't have to be this way , John . What the hell is going on ? Murphy : Otan ate the damn chip . That 's what 's going on . No one else has to die today . Tell me , is your imaginary friend waterproof ? - Should we find out ? - She 's not imaginary . She 's very , very real , and she can help you . All you have to do is say yes . All you have to do is let her go . You 're in a lot of pain , John . I 've been there . Losing my son almost killed me . The City of Light unburdened me . It made me whole . I can unburden you , John . You just simply return what 's mine . [ Gasping ] - I got a better idea . - Stop ! You want me to stop ? You let her go right now , or I 'm gonna drown the bitch in the red dress . - Good . - Otan ... Emori , get in the boat . Now give me the pack . It 's all yours , Chancellor . Start the boat . We 're leaving . Murphy : Bon voyage , Jaha . We should go after them . There 's no need . They 'll understand . How can you be so sure ? Because I haven 't told you the best part . You know there 's no pain here . There 's no death in the City of Light , either . He 's waking up . Hey ... _ _ _ Thank you , Abby . When can we move him ? Doesn 't look good for us to be here . This place just saved his life . It 's not that simple . Our people , they 'll never see anything but death here . Our people are wrong , Lincoln , and we can change their minds . Places are not evil , brother . People are . Abby , this place , it could do so much good for our people and theirs . We have to find hope somewhere . Ok . Ok what ? Ok . Let 's open it up . Where is it ? Come on ! - Hey ... - I 'm fine . This was her favorite ... represents the Second Circle of Hell , which is pretty ironic if you think about it . I told her I liked it , but ... I don 't know . I miss her . It 'll get better . Wh ... when ? Monty : 42 of us got out alive . We did what we had to . Pike : You did the right thing . Kill or be killed . So Mount Weather is ours now ? Yeah . Yeah . We use it for supplies . Supplies ? It 's a nuclear-hardened underground city . We established a truce . We need to think about perception . You need to think about what happens when the Grounders break that truce , because they will . Oh , crap . Bellamy , what are you doing ? [ Horn blaring ] [ Drums and shouting ] [ Distant horn blares ] [ Pants ] Bellamy . - I 'll get you out of here . - Look out ! Clarke : Oh , please . Please don 't . I 'll do anything . I ... I 'll stop fighting . Just please don 't kill him . Thank you . Don 't follow us . Monty : Bellamy . He 's hurt . Kane : He 's here . We told you to wait for the army to move . What happened ? I ... I ... I almost got her . I ... Pike , find their trail . Its useless . He knows he 's being followed now . Hey . You can 't even walk . So , what , we ... we give up , let him kill her ? God ... Bellamy , I want to find her , too , but look at your leg . You could die out here . We have no trail . We can 't lose Clarke . We ... We can 't lose her . We 'll find her , ok ? We will figure something out , I promise ... but this isn 't the way . Ok . I got you . Come on . Let 's head back . _ [ Clarke gasps ] Hello , Clarke . The deal was for you to bring her to me unharmed . She didn 't come easy . I 'd expect not . I 've done my part . Now do yours . Lift my banishment . I 'm told your mother 's army marches on Polis . Honor our deal . I 'll honor our deal when your queen honors my coalition . Lock Prince Roan of Azgeda away . Yes , Heda . - What of Wanheda ? - Leave us . You heard me . _ I 'm sorry . It had to be this way . Had to ensure one Heda didn 't fall into the hands of the Ice Queen . War is brewing , Clarke . I need you . You bitch ! You wanted the Commander of Death ? You 've got her ! I 'll kill you ! No !

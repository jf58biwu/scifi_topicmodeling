Where 's my money ? Are you a historian ? Mr. Palacios ... Chap , perfect , I need you to get up to 745 ... Yes , I will , I just ... Welcome to the perriman grand . Allow us to help you with that . If I could get my check a little early this month ? What ? Why ? Are you okay ? Yeah , I could just ... use the money . Yeah , look , Todd , I need you to get up to 745 right away . There 's some kind of a drunk woman up there acting crazy , and do me a favor , check out the pent house , they 've had a " do not disturb " since 2 : 00 P.M. yesterday . You still have your master key ? No , I-I misplaced it . Take mine . 745 , and then the penthouse . Okay , but then we can talk about the check ? Later , yes . Later , hmm ? Okay . ... Yeah , well , I 'm here on assignment , so just ... - No , I was just ... - Get out of the way . Oh , I 'm sorry . Oh . Do I have to leave ? Or could I just sit here for a second ? Take your time . Can you just hang out ... With me ? For a second ? I hate men . I 'll be out of here in an hour . Okay , if you need anything , my name is ... Todd . I hate voicemail ! Hey , sis , it 's me . Listen , I 'm not ignoring you , I just ... I don 't know if I have the money right now , and I know I promised you , but there have been some ... Unforeseen circumstances . I 'm going to get past it , and I 'm gonna get you the money , - and you 'll be able to ... - Time machine ! No , you lied to me . You lied to me the whole time and now you 've screwed both of us . No ! Silence ! No ! Don 't you say a word . I don 't want to hear ... Holy shit , this is when it happened . That means ... Come on ! Todd ? Where the hell are you , Todd ? I ... I don 't know . Have you checked out the penthouse ? I mean , I 'm ... I 'm on my way . I 'm on my way . Estevez . Zimmerfield . Missing persons . Missing persons ? This is a homicide , or ... Something . We believe this homicide has possible ties to an ongoing Probable ties to an ongoing missing persons case ... Wait . What do you mean " or something ? " It is strange in here . What are those , are those burns ? The guy in the bed was torn in half . The other guy had his arm torn off . There are bite marks on the ceiling . So we are looking for like ... An animal , or a weapon ? There are multiple bite marks on the ceiling . They say the noise only went on for 10 or so seconds . Zim , what the hell does this in 10 seconds ? A man was bitten in half . Bitten in half ? They say they got a witness . Oh , yeah ? How big are his teeth ? And you have no idea when the key left your possession ? No . I 'll be honest , it doesn 't look great , Todd . Late to work , late getting to the penthouse , no key . It all seems very , you know ... Confluent . Yeah . Adding up to me raising my eyebrows like ... Like that . See , I can 't do it . Only Zimmerfield can . Only Zimmerfield . Security tapes are badly scrambled but we did manage to pull this . Before you arrived in the penthouse . Is that your key ? I don 't think so . Wait , is he wearing a gorilla mask ? You didn 't ... See anything weird this morning , Did you , Mr. Brotzman ? Yes . No . M-maybe . I don 't know . You just gave every possible response to that question ? Eyebrows . If I were you , I wouldn 't leave town . Hmm ? Is there ... Is there any way you could get the security footage for the 18th floor ? That the security footage was badly scrambled . Any particular reason you want that , Todd ? Did something happen on the 18th floor ? No , I ... Okay , no . You didn 't touch anything at the scene , did you , Todd ? No . Don 't leave town . I won 't . Seriously . Don 't leave town . Okay . Todd ! Hey , man , snap out of it . Yeah , sorry , what ? I said , they think it 's connected to something bigger . What , like the mob ? No . While you were in there , did you see any kind of an animal ? Animal ? - No , I ... - They said they found paw prints . Paw prints ? Like a dog ? No . Also , you 're fired . Your involvement in all of this , it 's complicated . You can 't fire me . I just opened a door . Well , some doors shouldn 't be opened . Okay , okay , okay , is there any way ... please is there anyway you can give me my final check today , - as a type of severance . - Well , it 's a same-day termination , - I have to delay the check . - Same day ? What do you mean same day ? - It 's just happened today . - Yes , today is the day that is the same , today is the day that it happened . Right , but any day that it would 've happened would 've been the day it happened ... - Listen , I need the money ... - Yes , but it 's a same-day termination . It 's always a day , right ? Things happen when they happen . They happen immediately , that 's what " happening " is , it means ... No , Todd , sometimes when things happen , they don 't happen . Hi ! Ow ! Right , now you 're gonna get ... Hi-ya ! Whoa ! Stop it ... Jesus ! With the ... What the hell , man ! You " what the hell ? " No ! Me " what the hell ? " How did you get in here ? The window , obviously . Do you attack everyone who comes in here . Seems like a weird thing to do , you can 't just break in to my apartment . Well , clearly , I can . I mean , I just did ... I 'll call the police . I 'm trying to decide whether you 're a clue , an accomplice , or an assistant . Who are you ? What is this ? Have you noticed an acceleration of strangeness in your life as of late ? Perhaps a series of intense or extraordinary events , which , as of now , seem unconnected , with the exception of each being separately bizarre ? Perhaps every day before now has , for the most part , been humdrum and inane , your life a mundane , unvarying slog through unfulfilling jobs , shallow depression , and boring , boring sex ? Well ... And then suddenly , today , everything changed , And your life became a swirl of interesting activity ? An assistant . I knew it . Oh , my name is Dirk Gently . I 'm a detective , I live here now , and ... Ooh . ... I 'll be sleeping here tonight . You 're a terrible assistant . " Project Icarus " is leaving the building . What about the other guy ? I don 't know yet . What ? What ? It 's hard to hear you through the comm in my ear . I 'm not talking to you through the comm . I 'm talking right to you . - Got a shoot . - What do you mean , you 've got a shot ? Do I take the shot ? Don 't take the shot ... Confirmed , taking the shot . What the hell are you doing ? You are endangering the whole goddamn operation ! Shit . What the hell just happened ? Who were those guys ? Plates came up military . Is the guy we 're tailing ... Meeting up with another guy , who is also being tailed , By ... other people ? I let everyone down . Stupid , stupid , stupid ! I 'm so bored . My life sucks . Is it bad , or ... No , I mean , it was a little better today . Maybe it 'll keep getting better . Didn 't you say that it started out feeling better A little bit at a time when it happened to you ? Y-yeah , a little bit , - but ... - Don 't worry , I 'm not getting my hopes up . When aunt Esther would have good days and bad days ? Yeah , I just remember the bad days . Hey , I 'm coming up tomorrow . Your message said you didn 't have the money . Yeah , well ... I 'll figure something out , okay ? I 'll figure it out . You seem stressed out . Is everything okay over there ? Money . - Don 't leave town . - Also , you 're fired . Hi-ya ! No , I ... Everything 's fine . Hurry up ! I 'm going as fast as I can , okay ! Look , it 's not easy doing this under pressure . Plus , I 've never worked with this kind of rigging before ! It 's not like you 're paying me that much anyway . This is private property . No , no , no ! No ! Stay away ! No ! Somebody ! Help me ! Please ! Oh , god ! No ! Please ... Dirk Gently , you are a dead man ! Who 's ... Who 's Dirk Gently ? You 're not Dirk Gently ? No . What , are you kidding me right now ? Then why did you run ? You have a machete ! Why didn 't you just say " I 'm not Dirk Gently ? " Because I don 't know who that is ! Hi ! What are you still doing here ? What are you doing here ? I live here . Right , but where are you going ? Didn 't you say you lost your job ? No , I didn 't say that , actually . - How did you ... - I 'm a detective . I 'm on a case . You worked at that hotel , where the murders took place . Been all over the news , for people who still watch the news , you know , old people , and me , occasionally . Was I on TV ? Would it be bad for you if you were ? None of your business . - May be it is . - No , it isn 't . - Where are you going ? - None of your business . You don 't even know my business ! Maybe I 'm a cab driver . You just said you were on a case . Maybe I have two jobs ! Leave me alone . - But maybe ... - No ! Where ? My sister 's house , okay ? I 'll give you a ride . What 's the alternative . Unless you have some kind of magic car-fixing robot . You don 't , though . I 've seen in your apartment . It 's an hour away . Time , I laugh at the concept . I can spend a whole day without even trying . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Where are you going ? - Let 's go . - Where 's my money , huh ? Where 's my rent ? Where 's my rent money ? Careful , it 's not my car . You paid me ? Do I look like an accountant to you ? Do I look like I know how much you paid me ? Shit . Go , go , go ! Dirk ! Make sure he comes back with my money ! What the ... They 're going to bounce this case to major crimes unless we can turn up something to connect this to Lydia Spring , and I mean soon . Anybody find that kitten ? With the bloody ... No , but uniforms found a hole in a wall in a stairwell adjacent to the penthouse . Went straight through to the electrical system , some kind of pulse blew up the whole deal . What could 've caused that ? Lightning strike . Did that happen ? Nope . We even checked the lightning rods . They still have lightning rods ? As long as they have lightning . Where was the security , Zim ? Patrick spring always rolled with bodyguards . We should talk to Farah Black again . We 've got her on file from when Lydia first went missing , right here . Already tried . No answer . This is connected to Lydia . It has to be , right ? Rich girl gets in a fight with her father , Less than one week later , he 's dead ? Could be a coincidence . That would be ridiculous . Like bite marks on the ceiling ? Like bite marks on the ceiling . What did you got there ? I 've been trying to find monkey mask on the tapes , See if we can trace his progress to the room , but it seems like he knew where the cameras were . Or he was already staying in the hotel . I did find one thing kind of interesting , though . Whose dog is that ? Come on , relax , enjoy the ride . I can already tell we 've got oodles in common . We both like , um , eating , breathing . We both can , walk . Listen , there 's an ocean of commonalities here abroad the door . Why does Dorian know your name ? Who ? Oh , right , I was talking to him this morning . About what ? Your apartment building , the Ridgely . Fascinating history , that place . Asshole ! Who are you ? I 'm a detective , a holistic detective , and before you ask , no , I 'm not with the CIA anymore . A holistic ... What is a " holistic detective " ? I 'm very glad you asked me that , Mister ... What 's your name ? - Todd . - I 'm very glad you asked me that , Todd . The term " holistic " refers to my convictions about the fundamental interconnectedness of all things . With such petty things as fingerprint powder , telltale pieces of pocket fluff and inane footprints . You 're a detective who doesn 't find clues . That sounds , you know , insane . I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web of the whole . The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtler and complex than we , with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world might naturally suppose . Man ! Jesus Christ ! Sorry . New car . I thought you said this wasn 't your car . Doesn 't mean it isn 't new . It was good you decided to come with me . I didn 't decide anything . You said you 'd kill me if I didn 't come . Well , you decided it would be better to come with me than die . That was nice . We gotta stop for gas . But ... You don 't need gas . Call it a hunch . Hey , hi ho hey , get up on the roof . Where I can see you till I get back . The roof ? Won 't this look suspicious ? Suspicious ? Ken , you 're a riot . Did you just kill someone ? I 'm an assassin . That 's what I do , I kill people . You didn 't notice ? You were hired to come here ? No , I 'm a holistic assassin . A what ? A what ? " Holistic " is the fundamental interconnectedness of all things . I don 't do your whole deal with sniper rifles , poison , or getting hired . I just , I kill whoever I feel like killing all day , and if I killed them , they were my target . The connection between cause and effect is much more , you know , subtle than you would otherwise think . I mean ... You wouldn 't believe it . Things , they ... They double up . They parallel . Everything is chaos , but it ... It 's synchronized ? It 's like there 's always something ready to mirror itself , life ... endlessly turning inward . Don 't get me wrong ... But that just sounds like a murder spree . I 've never killed the wrong person . I have killed a lot of people , though . Get in the car . See ? And you 're already acting like an assistant . I just ... I 'm just trying to be helpful . It 's not ... What I came here to say . You know , I started to think , you 're more important to this case than you realize . What case ? You broke into my apartment . Well ... I mean , how do you even investigate anything if you don 't use any investigative ... stuff ? Interconnectedness ! Coincidence , and the rarer , sexier coinky-dinks . Once hired , I am intrinsically connected to the specific case . I then will eventually solve the mystery merely by just kind of doing whatever . So , then who told you to break into my apartment ? No one , I was investigating your building for other reasons , which will for now remain tangential , and I just had a hunch you might be important . Hey , and I was right . I found a very compelling piece of evidence . What did you find ? Nothing . But you just said ... Everything is connected . Nothing is also connected . Don 't run any more red lights . Whatever keeps you sane . Oh , no . We should go . We should go . Ring the bell . What the hell ? You said you were going to stay in the car . I lied , though . What ? Did you see how I snuck up ? I was trained as a ninja by the CIA . What ? Sorry that 's a lie , too . Just go back to the car . Todd ... You came ! Yeah , of course , I came . What , you didn 't think I would come ? I ... Who 's this ? It 's , uh ... It 's Dirk Gently . Dirk ... okay , hi . Sorry . I 'm Amanda . - Hi ! - No , don 't . Don 't say hello ? Hello , Amanda ! Are you friends ? - No . - Yes . - Yes . - No . - No . - Yes . - Yes . - No . We 're very good friends . Ow ! You 're a terrible assis-friend . The death of billionaire entrepreneur Patrick Spring and several others , by an animal attack rather than a murder as was initially reported , though the nature of the animal remains undisclosed at this time . Sources within the police department will neither confirm nor deny ... Whether the tragic incident has any connection to the recent disappearance of Spring 's daughter , Heiress Lydia Spring , now missing for over four days ... Do you have any friends who can come by and just help you with this , cleaning up , or ... It 's hard to keep friends when you can 't go outside without worrying a gust of wind will knock you down . I barely get out of the house anymore . God . Why don 't you move back in with Mom and Dad ? - May be they can help you . - You know that they 're broke , Todd . I would just be a burden on them . I 'm a burden on everyone . What 's wrong with you , exactly ? I have pararibulitus . Ah , of course . What 's that ? Who are you ? I 'm Dirk Gently . I 'm a private detective . You don 't look like a private detective . Well , no private detective looks like a private detective . That 's one of the first rules of private detection . But if no private detective looks like a private detective , how does a private detective know what it is that he shouldn 't look like ? It 's a nerve disease . It causes your brain to misinterpret certain inputs , and you actually have hallucinations that feel real , and , in most cases , very painful . So ... That means ... Water on your hand could feel like fire . Your shoe on your foot could feel like crushing and breathing could feel like drowning . I 'm sorry . That 's terrible . And so interesting . Yeah , well , it makes it hard to not be scared all the time . But Todd had it , and he got better , so ... I just need to take my meds and eat healthy . So then why do you stay in the house ? What ? If the disease is in you , why does it matter where you go ? Hey , uh ... Amanda , do you wanna jam ? Yeah . Of course . Cool . I 'll be there in a minute . Why are you doing this ? I 'm on a case . My primary method of investigation is to follow someone who looks like they know where they 're going ... Is it top important that you not be identified as my friend , that you felt the need to argue about it ? You are an insane person , who has insinuated himself into my life in a moment of desperation . Okay , well , I think you 're an insane person , who is insinuating himself into being my combination assistant and best friend . But that 's ... It-it 's ... Okay that is not what 's happening . I have the primary and the secondary in my sights . Uh-huh . What ? I thought we were clear that the rifle isn 't necessary . Yeah , but in the mishkin parambuler , it said that we have to prevent all aggressive action against the primary . The what ? The mission parameters ? Except that 's not what you said . The gum went weird in my mouth , sir . It went weird and made my tongue do a weird move and say stuff wrong . What branch did they assign you to me from ? Provisional ? They said you didn 't have the budget for the op . Okay . Our goal is to observe and protect the primary . Not ... To kill anyone . Right . Understood . I 've got a shot . Ah ! It 's okay . It 's okay . You okay ? Back off , okay ? Back off ! Thank you . So , you pay for her medication ? I did . What 's changed ? That was my last $ 300 . I now literally have no money . None . I don 't understand . You lost your job , you 've got that nut Dorian chasing you around , why give her all of your money ? Surely ... A disease runs in my family , it has for five generations . - Pararibulitis ? - Yeah , right . How did you pay for treatment ? You don 't seem ... Our parents . I was in college . They had more money back then . By the time I 'd recovered , my treatments had pretty much depleted all their savings . It 's good of you to help . She 's my sister . Every time I see her , she looks at me , and thinks ... She thinks maybe she can get better , too . Well , isn 't there a chance she will , though ? If you did ? Let 's ... Can we just be quiet for the drive ? Probably should 've seen this one coming . Like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs . There 's no way I could have known what ... I 'm not ... I 'm coming to get you , Lydia . I am coming to get you , okay ! I 'm coming to get you ! What ? Why ? No , just leave me alone . - I live here now . - What ? Well , why do you think I was talking to Dorian . Did you not hear my voice ? I 'm not from here , I 'm from a totally different place . England . Screw this . Ow ! Ah ! Shit , sorry . Ow ! I ... ah-hah ! Hey ! That 's mine ! What do you want now ? I need you to work with me , I wanted to discuss the case . What case ? The death of Patrick Spring . The incident at the Perriman Grand ? I was hired to investigate it ... By the victim . Patrick Spring , the rich guy ? Wait , he 's the one who died at the hotel ? That 's right and he hired me , well above my normal rate , to investigate his own death a full six weeks before it even happened . I wouldn 't have taken the case except , come on , animal attack ? Seattle ? A guy predicting his own death ? Pretty interesting stuff . And how am I involved in any of this ? You were there , the day it happened . They used your key . The cases are connected . All cases are connected . Have you ever actually solved a case ? Sure . Tons . Well , some . Well , a few . There was a bit about a sofa , a thing with Thor ... Thor ? Yes , he 's not nearly as good-looking as people say . Listen , Dirk , you seem like a nice guy . Or , not nice , but you seem like a guy , okay ? You seem like a guy , but I can 't do this . I 'm a murder suspect , okay ? I 'm broke ... Don 't be silly . Money won 't be a problem for you soon , Todd . How do you figure that ? Now that I 've told you you 're working the case , you are working the case , the universe will make you a part of this whether you are accomplice or not . You are now a vital part of the investigation . Well , so who 's going to pay me . You ? Probably not . But you will investigate , even if you don 't mean to , and you will be compensated , even if you haven 't technically earned it . Oh , no . Things are about to get ugly . Stay frosty . What 's this ? " Project Incubus . " Shit ! Ow ! Stupid traitor bed ! Whoo ! Whoo ! I 'm sick of the games ! No chess , no checkers , no Monopoly ! What is this ? What is happening ? The rowdy 3 ! Let 's go ! There are four of them . I 'm wildly aware . They 're after you , right ? Come on , Dirk , please go ! Please , just go ! Bad news delivery ! Hello ! What the hell is this new shit ? Big D is gonna take care of business ! Listen , I am a person of varied intuitions . And they 're rarely wrong , but also rarely completely right . That 's the nature of the situation , that 's a reality we 're going to accept . Accepted ? No ? Yes ? Doesn 't matter . There 's four men with baseball bats headed up the stairs right now to wreck your apartment ! - No , no , no , no ! - No , Todd , no ! No . Please ... I don 't want to be a part of this . Please , just go , please . Ding dong . We are not professionals ! Before we tear it out your face and throw it in a dumpster ! Help ! There 's garbage everywhere ! What the ... Television ! I have had enough of this shit . Jesus , you gotta be kiddin ' me . We got eyes on a gun , require backup at 515 ... Request backup at 515 Ridgely Lane . Dorian 's gonna kick your ass ! Shit , Alpha is in danger . We 're live . Lock and load . Okay . Lockers . No . Everything I own ... No ... Why ? What did they do to you ? It 's complicated Where 's my rent , Todd ? What did you guys do to this place ? Who were those guys ? You think they intimidate me ? Just listen ... No , it 's too late , nobody makes a fool out of me ! What , you think I 'm stupid ? Tell me you have some kind of way out of this . I 'm sorry , I 'm very good at getting in to situations . I 've often found I have more trouble getting out of them ... Dirk , shut up ! Just shut up ! I know what you did . I warned you ! Bye-bye , you thieving mother ... Shots fired ! Shots fired ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Move out ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Freeze ! Freeze ! - Drop the gun ! - No , you drop the gun ! - Freeze ! - Drop it ! Drop it ! - FBI ! - Drop your weapons ! - Drop it ! - Freeze ! What is going on ? You okay ? Find me ! Find me ! I 'm right here ! What now ? You 're free to go . For now . Really ? The death looks like an accident . For now . Good news is that FBI had surveillance on Dorian Ozman 's house . They did ? Uh ... Why ? Apparently , he sold a really incredible amount of jewels to an astonishing number of people . So , I 'm not a suspect in anything ? You 're a person of interest , permanently , even though you 're not necessarily an interesting person . That feels unnecessarily rude . The police will determine the proper levels of antagonism toward a man now connected to four dead bodies in two separate cases . The " do not leave town " order is still in effect . Do not leave town . Hey , you 're not supposed to be down here . Hermano Palacios ? Um ... Yes ? Did you find a kitten ? What ? In the penthouse , did you find a kitten ? Kitten , look , I don 't know what you 're talking about . All done down here , Ed . You 're sure you did not see a kitten ? Crap . They let me out , too . Must 've been the CIA , always getting me out of things . They didn 't even mention the bloody rowdy 3 , but I guess the CIA must 've told them not to , - which make ... - Shut up . I don 't care . Go away . Need a ride ? Someone died tonight . They died right in front of us , that doesn 't bother you ? I think it might bother me more later , when I 'm less ... Something . Do you want to know why Dorian wanted the rent ? Because he was crazy . No , because I stole it from him . Huh , but ... what ? I was afraid because I knew Amanda need her meds . And I didn 't think I 'd be able to get an advance at the hotel , so I paid him in cash , I snuck around the back of his house when he wasn 't there , I stole it back . I thought he 'd be too cracked out to notice , he did notice , and he wouldn 't let it go , and now he 's dead . Well ... To be honest , that seems practical to me . Practical ? He shot himself in the head ! B-but you 're okay , right ? I have nothing . I don 't have my apartment , I have zero money , I have no prospects . I 'm homeless , and living a lie , and I 'm a suspect in multiple homicides . Well , when you put it like that , it 's pretty bad , but we 've got a case to solve . A missing girl , her murdered father , and , undoubtedly , more pieces falling into place ... I am not your Watson , asshole ! I 'm not available for side-kicking on something I am not involved with ! I am my own messed up person , with my own messed up problems ! No , just shut up . You never shut up ! - Stop . Stop ... - Shut up ! Stop ! You 've been making choices out of desperation for too long , that much is obvious . You 're backing yourself into a corner . Break the pattern . Take control of your life , Todd . The instant you take control , interesting things will happen . I guarantee it . You know what , no , I don 't want to hear all that from you right now . Keep the Hallmark card . Stop the bus ! Stop the bus ! Stop the bus ! I , uh ... Your dog , I-I brought ... The address was on the tag . Come here ... Thanks . Yeah , that 's Brotzman . ... And we 'll pick another winner tonight . That 's right , every moment is an opportunity . Every second is a chance to change your life . Aw ... This is your big opportunity . Every choice is a new beginning . The smallest decisions in life can have the biggest consequences . It 's never too late . This is your chance to fix everything . Now ... Announcing tonight 's $ 10,000 midnight pick ! The winning numbers are ... 7 ... 4 ... 5 ... 15 ... 0 ... 1 Where 's my rent , Todd ? What did you guys do to this place ? Who were those guys ?

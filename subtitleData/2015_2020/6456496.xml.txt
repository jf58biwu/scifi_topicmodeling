 They 'll be gone a while . Got the place to ourselves . Actually , I 'm going out as well . - Where exactly is she ? - Edmonds Street . Is there anyone called Tom living there ? - So , what happens now ? - Anything you want . We 've intercepted a call - fight in progress at a smash club . She 's attacking people , not synths . What do you think 's wrong with my synth ? - Is Mia with you ? - Who 's Mia ? Our father hid a program in our heads . Think it 's what he used to give you consciousness . It needs all of us to run it , all of us . This machine needs to be recycled , mate . Go into the woods . This might be the single biggest murder case in our country 's history . If there are more synths out there who can kill ? Well , we 're all screwed , then , aren 't we ? - Tell me what you saw . - A tree . When I touched it , it felt like ... life . What does it do ? I think it 's a way to make more of you . Dad didn 't destroy all his work before he died . He hid it in us . The formula for machine consciousness . If we could make more of us , then the humans would have to accept our existence . They 'd fear us even more . - All I want is a home . - He meant for us to find this . We need Fred and Mia . Where do we start ? No , you don 't . You 're wanted for murder . - You have to lay low . - I will not hide again . If you want this to work , you 'll have to . The people hunting us know your face now . 53 Park Drive , NW6 . You 'll be safe there until I find the others . - You 've put me with a human ? - This human , yes . Two days . Alright . Uh , one more thing . Be , uh ... nice . I am nice . Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone - something - like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . I 'm gonna say a word . I want you to tell me if it means anything to you . 'Mia ' . That mean anything ? No , Mattie . They say she ripped some bloke 's throat out . It 's bollocks . No synth 's ever hurt anyone deliberately . Anita , please go and , um ... finish the ironing . Sophie , sit next to Mats . Alright , so ... You know your mum thinks Anita is a bit different ? We thought we 'd check up on her . And ... turns out she 's not brand-new . In fact , she 's really old and probably illegally modified . Which explains a lot . So ... we have to take her back . - No ! - Why ? We paid for a brand-new one . And she 's ancient . Anything could go wrong with her . You can 't get rid of someone just because they 're old . I don 't want her going into someone else 's house . - She won 't . They 'll recycle her . - She saved my life . And you just want to chuck her away ? - Mats , what do you think ? - I say we keep her . I 'd like to find out what she was before . - Yeah , I vote keep . - We 're not voting . - Laur ? - So Anita 's old and weird . If that 's a good enough reason to get rid of her , we 're next . Yeah , I 'm sorry , Dad . She 's part of this family . Maybe she 's part of someone else 's . K ! Have you seen the news ? ! - Bloody hell , Pete ! Privacy ! - Yes , sorry . Sometimes I forget you 're a woman . Uh ... I 'll just be in the kitchen cutting my tongue out . Don 't make a mess . DI Voss , you will be briefing the press and you will refute every killer synth claim and any internal cover-up . For now , we 'll use this leak to our advantage . - Drummond . - Sir . You 're going back on the desk . I want every call followed through . And if this dolly hurts anybody else , then I 'll be replacing the pair of you with synthetics twice as pretty and a fraction of the cost . Sir , there was a 999 call routed here last night concerning a smash club , but there 's no follow-up , nothing in the system . - Who mentioned that ? - No-one , sir . I like to browse the incident logs . Find it soothing . Well , as it happened , I was in dispatch when that call came through . It was just a time-waster . Now , off you go . Press are waiting . It 's DI Voss , STTF . Sorry to wake you . You were in the control room last night . Did you take a call about an incident at a smash club ? Did someone ask you to drop it ? You don 't have to tell me who , just what the caller said . Thank you . Stop up here . - Yeah . - Leo Elster sent me . Why ? He said I 'd be safe here . - Guess he made a mistake . - Wait . You want a cup of tea or what ? It 's cold out here . Vera ! Come on . Get this young lady a hot drink . Synthetics don 't require beverages , Dr Millican . Jeez , Vera , she 's human . I can detect no cardiac or respiratory activity . This individual is , however , emitting electromagnetic signatures within the recognised spectrum of standard synthetic appliance operation . - Why don 't you share ? - ' Cause I 'm not a synth , dolly . Well , if she says she 's not a synth , then she can 't be a synth , right ? I will bring some tea . What are you ? My name is Niska . I was made by David Elster . Are you conscious ? Oh ... This is one of Hu-bot97 's friends . If we can find him , he 'll lead us to her . When we have a home again , I 'm going to keep a picture of us . I 'll be right with you , Max . You won 't need pictures . I will for when you die again . We can 't keep her . I know what we said this morning . But I don 't think the kids have a say in this one . Maybe her being 14 is a good thing . Explains how well she understands us . How could it be a good thing ? She must have had who knows how many owners and people tinkering around inside her . I mean , have you seen the news ? - A modded synth killed someone . - Hello ? So now you want to talk to me . What 's changed ? I 've found out something about her . Will you meet me again ? Please ? - I don 't know . - Why ? What 's the matter ? You . You 're weird . No , I 'm not . You really are . Tried to stop me leaving last time , remember ? Well , I 've been to charm school since then . What are you talking about ? Tom . Who is he ? I don 't know what you 're on about or what it has to do with Anita . Fine . I can 't make you tell me . - Are you still there ? - Yeah . I 've got to go . It 's not a good time . Look , I 'm sending you my location now . - Please change your mind . - Hmm . Not theirs , not yours . So what ? I have to do what I think is best for our family . Hiya . I 'm here to collect a synthetic return . It 's number 901-354-982 . - You 're gonna recycle her ? - With care and dignity . You can attend the event . Is Joseph Hawkins here ? I take it that 's your dad . Uh , yeah . Just one second , please . Anita , you 're coming with me . Daddy 's just coming . Uh , hello ? Anyone ? Please reconsider this course of action , Mattie . - It 's very unsafe . - Yeah . Mats ! Do you really think this excessive motion will bring her to us sooner ? Any inappropriate physical contact must be reported to my primary user . No , no ... There 's no sign of recognition . The new programming 's taken hold . No , there 's something else in there . Believe me . I 've seen it . Thank you for bringing her back to me . My name 's Leo . Where are you ? Mattie , I believe this to be an improper environment . They 're my friends , Anita . You 're just gonna help us with a science project for school . Why don 't you come and sit down , Anita ? It is not advisable to mount a direct data connection ... It 's OK , Anita . Leo . - This isn 't Mia . - But she 's in there somewhere . We just need to find her and bring her back to the surface . Like the lake ? Yes . - You said you 'd seen her ? - Yeah . When I got that code , I was in her head . She freaked out , screamed , and her face , it was , like human , scared . - And what exactly did you do ? - Nothing fancy . Just accessed her root system directly with a cloned file key . Right . I might as well try that first . So are you a headcracker ? Me ? No , aspiring . So , what kind of synth was she before ? A very special one . No . Direct access didn 't work . She must have retreated deeper within the architecture . Won 't your parents be worried ? They 'll miss you . No . - No . - Oh , God . Well , we need to start thinking about calling the police . She 'll come back . It 'll be fine . She doesn 't know how to drive , Joe . What if she crashes , hits someone ? Well , Anita won 't let that happen . I thought she was supposed to be dangerous . Come on . God , if we hadn 't been arguing , this never would have happened . Hey . Hey . Come on . Come on . It 's gonna be fine . Everything 's gonna be alright . There 's no point in staring at me . There 's no physical differences between me and any other synthetic . " And once you are awake , you shall remain awake eternally . " 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra ' . I 've always liked that . You like Nietzsche ? That makes sense . If it 's not physical , how did he do it ? 17,000 pages of unique code which forms my root directory and engages consciousness . He boiled down the mystery of the human mind to 17,000 pages of code ? Well , then again , why not ? " How many angels can dance on the head of a pin ? " What are you feeling right now ? Boredom at that question . Anger at the people that would destroy us . Hope , for others like me and our future . Impatience at being here . And irritation at you . What 's it like to be you ? Well , that 's an unanswerable question . I have no frame of reference . No-one does . Experience is entirely subjective . What 's it like to be you ? These days , it 's not so great . A while ago , it was it was pretty good . Who wants to destroy you ? Anyone who knows what we are , what we could become . We 're stronger . We 're more intelligent . Of course you see us as a threat . Yeah . Well , I know I did . David lured me over here from MIT , what , 25 years ago now to help with the mechanical designs of the bodies of the first synths . The work that we did in those days made history , changed the world . Then I realised that his next ambition was you . I asked him to stop and think - that 's all - what that could mean for humanity . That was blasphemy to him . He got rid of me . That was that . Now here you are . Well , I 'm sorry to disappoint you . I 'm not disappointed . I 'm a scientist . And mankind 's greatest creation is sitting on my ... couch ! You worry me sure , but there 's no denying that you are a miracle . Leo showed me the message from David . - What is that ? - It 's the key to the future . Maybe you were right to warn him . He made you pretty hard , huh ? That 's lazy thinking . My experiences have shaped me , just as yours have you . What experiences ? Tell me . I need to charge . OK , I need you to engage the Anita software . Alright . Ask it a specific question . Anita , what happened the day that we got you ? - The 24th . - Capturing from that . Joe Hawkins is my primary user . Sophie Hawkins , Toby Hawkins , Mattie Hawkins are my ... It 's not letting you ? What ? It 's sort of ... it 's redirecting over the top like there 's nothing else there . Try a deauthentication attack on the host she 's attached to . - No , no , that 's way too basic . - The 24th . I 'm now securely bonded . Anita , AN Hawkins . I will always keep you safe . It 's raining . The 24th . I 'm now securely bonded . The 24th . I 'm now securely bonded . The 24th . Securely bonded ... 24th ... 24th ... - Come on . - The 24th ... 24th ... The 24th ... - It 's raining ... It 's raining ... - Stop it ! Stop it ! - Pull it ! Pull it ! - It 's raining ... It 's raining ... Did it work ? Max ? Is that you ? Unauthorised tamper in progress . Would you like to see a ladybird ? It 's almost dinnertime , Matilda . Where are you , Mimi ? I 'm not entirely sure . It appears to be a disused social club . My name is Anita . I will now prepare dinner . - What 's happening to her ? - It 's just glitching . We 're going pretty deep . It 's been 2 hours and 21 minutes , Leo . No . We 're trying again . Sit her down . Come on . - DS Drummond . - Good afternoon , sir . This is Amy at Sandhurst Synthetic Care . I 'm just phoning to let you know that your synthetic , Simon , is coming to the end of its rental period . Not my problem . Speak to my wife . I 'm afraid your name is on the rental agreement , sir . If the unit isn 't returned to us by five o 'clock tomorrow , we will have to charge your credit card . Bloody hell . Fine , fine . Hello , Peter . What are you doing ? Having some carrot cake . People are laughing at you . I don 't care . I 'd be nowhere without him . Well ... It needs to go back to the shop . - What ? - Time 's up . - They need it back . - It 's ... It 's just ... I mean , I still don 't feel 100 % . There must be a way ... There is . You cover the entire cost yourself . I can 't afford that . You must be joking . You left me for ... YOU left me . You just didn 't go anywhere . You know what 's nice ? I don 't have to walk on eggshells around him . I don 't have to think about what I 'm gonna say in case it makes him angry . I don 't have to lie there wondering if he still loves me , if he still finds me attractive after the accident , always worrying about what he 's thinking and what he 's feeling . I can rely on him . Completely . I need him . Please don 't take him away . Oh . I was at home . I don 't see ... I don 't care about your smash club . Tell me what happened . The blonde came in , paid her money and then went apeshit . Broken bones , cracked skulls . She didn 't touch the dollies . Called the Old Bill 'cause I thought she 'd kill someone . They never showed . Anything unusual about her appearance ? - No . - You have a video ? I uploaded it . It got taken down . She injured 11 people before escaping , but she took a call at the scene , and we were close enough to directly intercept most of it . The life program . It 's real . - Leo , what ? - I swear it . But it needs all of us to run it . All of us . Who 's she talking to ? Leo Elster . David Elster 's son ? He died when he was a boy . Yes . Drowned . Hospital records show brain death , coma before being released on life support to David 's private care , dying a few weeks later . Or so we were told . What are they talking about ? What 's hidden inside them ? All I can tell you is David succeeded in creating true AI . And I don 't believe for a moment he would have been satisfied with a legacy of just four machines . - Worst-case scenario ? - Consciousness proliferation . If what you say is true , this is a national , global security matter . They say it needs them all together to make this thing happen , whatever ' it ' is . Mm-hm . - Then it 's simple . You destroy the one you have here . Today . She 's gone . What ? She 's not in there . Mia 's gone , Max . She ... she 's dead . No . You 're wrong . I 've seen her . No , no . What you saw was an echo . The Anita personality has purged the old data . There 's ... there 's no trace of her . - And I 've tried everything . - Can I try something ? What could you do that I can 't ? ! You don 't know anything about us . Now , just go home and take it with you . She 's yours . No , she 's not anymore . Matilda ? Your school friend is right . We should go home now . Yeah . I 'm sorry . You 're still in there . I know it . Smoking , drinking , stealing the family car . Such a teenage cliché . They 're still out looking for you . You little pervert . - Nice talking to you . - You had sex with her . I wish . Who ? - Anita . - What ? - Where the hell have you been ? - What the hell 's wrong with you ? - Get off ! You 're mad . After the party , you brushed off that girl to shag Anita ? - No ! - What are you on about ? - Sex code . Activated Saturday . - I didn 't do anything ! You 're just trying to get out of a bollocking ! She 's the one who stole the family car , Mum , remember ? Oh , she 's in big trouble , don 't you worry . Did you do this ? No ! - You have to be 18 . I couldn 't ! - You 're such a liar . Maybe it 's a mistake . I 'm calling the shop . It 's not a mistake . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have done it . Oh , Tobe ! How could you ? Disgusting . Get out . I 'll deal with you later . I don 't know what to say to you . Sorry . Go to bed . We 'll talk in the morning . - She 's OK ? - Mm-hm . She said she just didn 't want us to send Anita back . Car 's alright . Are you OK ? Your son had sex with our synth . What ? It 's on the Persona report . " Adult mode activation " or something . I mean , have you spoken to him about it ? He said he 's sorry and he wouldn 't do it again . She stopped him being run over and he does that to her . Well , he 's ... a teenage boy . Oh , I didn 't mean it 's not a big deal . - Shall I go up ? - No . I said we 'd talk in the morning . OK . I 'll do it . Might be better . Fine . I 'll think up a punishment for Mattie to ignore . George could murder ... Please give me a description of the man . OK . That one is ... What is your emergency ? I mean , none of them will hurt you . If you could read me the serial number ? It 's just inside the bottom lip . That 's right , yep . Right . OK , um ... Leave it alone now , and someone will come and pick it up . Yeah , no , thank you . OK . Bye-bye . Would you like me to send a synthetic unit to collect it ? No , I 'm dealing with this one personally . Don 't listen to me when I 'm on the phone . DS Drummond , you are required to remain here , as recent ... Stick it up your bollocks . He said something about a murder . What with the news , I thought best to report it . Well , you did the right thing . I 've actually dealt with this one before . Ancient model . Should have been recycled weeks ago . It 's just over here . Oh . Well , he was . Leo . Wait . I 'm coming with you . No . Where are you going ? I don 't know . Mia 's dead , Fred 's gone . It 's over . It 's time you learned to take care of yourself . - But we 're a family . - No , we 're not . Niska was right . You 'd be better off without me . Look at the life I 've shown you , hunted and hiding like animals . You 've always tried your best . You 've always tried to protect us . And ... ? I 've failed . No , Max . Leave me alone ! - Everything 's ready . - Then let 's begin . I truly am sorry . Mum said you slept with Anita ? I lied . Why would you do that ? I don 't know . You tell me . I knew it . It was you . Why 'd you tell Mum it was you ? I couldn 't let her work out the truth , could I ? You two , you ... you 've always argued , but ... Well , it 's worse these days . Mum 's always away for work , and ... You act like everything 's cool , but ... but it 's not . Then you do that . Say something . You 're my dad ! You 're meant to say something ! Niska ? Is everything alright in there ? Ah ! David made you feel pain ? True consciousness isn 't possible without suffering . Or pleasure . Are you scared of pain ? I try to avoid it . And what about death ? If that 's the way you think of it . No . I don 't fear that . Which makes me stronger than any human . You got that the wrong way up . If you 're not worried about dying , you 're not really living . You 're just existing . Did you tell someone I was here ? No . Stay here . Remember me ? DS Drummond ? Special Technologies Task Force ? Can I come in and have a word ? Tried to do you a favour , Dr Millican . Told you you could recycle your out-of-date model yourself , and you repaid me by fly-tipping him in the woods . I 'm afraid that gets you a 175-quid fine . - You found Odi ? - Don 't take the piss . Is there someone else here ? I have a new care model . Right . Can I speak to it ? She 's out ... at the store . Please tell me that bleeding D-series isn 't here , Dr Millican . I wish he was . Don 't mind if I check , do you ? We have a ... We have birds nesting in the roof . If I do find him here , I can charge you with wasting police time . And I 've seen people hide synthetics in places that would make you weep for humanity . Yeah , my Vera leaks . Defective charging port . Come on . This is crazy . That 's Vera . Vera . This is a policeman . Have there been any other synthetics in this house lately ? A D-series synthetic appeared three days ago and drove Dr Millican away in his car . The vehicle collided with a tree in Henson woodlands and Dr Millican was treated for minor head injuries . The synthetic has not appeared since . I know who you are , Dr Millican . You worked with Elster . You must be very proud when you turn on the news these days . Why ? What happened ? Chips ? That usually means the bad guys got away . Sometimes I think very seriously about jacking it all in to become a millionaire playboy . I found something . On the synth we 're looking for . But we 've gotta keep it quiet . - What is it ? - I think she 's posing as a human . She 's changed her eye colour , wearing human clothes . - How is that possible ? - No idea . But it 's why we 're drawing a blank . We 're looking for a synth . We should be looking for a woman . Where did you get this ? She went to a smash club and beat up the punters instead . No-one 's ever gonna believe a synth could do that , no matter what 's in the news . I need you to quietly get anything that mentions her description , anything at all , for the whole city , but as a human . Shaw 's funnelling everything to that government bloke . If we want to find her before he does , it has to be just you and me . If they can pretend to be us now , that changes everything . We 're giving ourselves away , piece by piece . We 're handing over the things that make us who we are , or maybe who we were . - Our responsibilities . - Yeah . - Our dignity . - Yeah ! Look around . This place used to be full of people . Working people - creating , building , making . Coming together . Earning a place in our society . Those people haven 't just lost their jobs . - They 've lost their purpose . - Yeah ! But it 's not just work . Why raise your kids when a dolly can do it ? - Yeah ! - Why cook your family a meal when a dolly can do it ? Why go on a date ? Why try to get to know someone when you can pay a dolly for sex ? In every area of human life , they are coming between us . We don 't know how to connect to each other , only to them . And now , we can 't even trust them not to hurt us . We are stumbling towards the precipice . We 're racing towards it , willingly , with a smile on our face and a dolly 's hand in ours ! Yes , we are people ! We are people ! We are people ! We are people ! We are people ! We are people ! Did you speak to Tobe ? It , um ... It wasn 't him . Uh ... I 'd had a few glasses of wine , and ... I was pissed off with you . I was ... I was mucking about . I just ... I ... I wanted to know what would happen if ... It was an accident . Before I knew it , I ... I ... Before you knew it , what ? OK . - I messed around with Anita . - Oh ! I 'm sorry . It was ... it was stupid . Pointless . It was ... It was nothing . It was a moment of complete stupidity . I ... I knew we were having trouble , but I never , ever ever had you down as a cheat . Come ... come on . I 'm hardly a cheat . What ? It ... it was a machine . It 's not a person . Not ... OK , yeah , it 's disgu ... I 'm disgusting . But ... it 's a sex toy . It 's not another human being . She lives in our house . She looks after our children . She saved our son 's life . And ... you 're calling her a sex toy ? You 're actually trying to justify this . Oh , God . That 's why you were so keen to get rid of her , isn 't it ? Who are you ? Who am I ? Who are you ? And who the fuck is Tom ? Oh , God . Laur . Laur ... Get out ! Get out ! Who is this man ? That 's Professor Edwin Hobb . He was on David 's core team too for the first prototypes . Was he involved in our creation ? Oh , no - David had a falling-out with him too , just like he did with me . Not sure about what . For the last few years he worked alone . You 're breathing fast . Your pulse is raised . Your pupils are dilated . What 's wrong ? Just need my meds . Now you 're lying . That tech was priceless . You asked me to destroy it . Only way to be sure . Don 't whine , Robert . There are more out there . Correct ? - Mm-hm . - Then there 'll be other opportunities , soon . This means we have one less thing to worry about .

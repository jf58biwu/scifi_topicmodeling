 Previously on " The 100 " ... You should have killed me on that battlefield . He 's strong . We need him if we 're gonna fight our way out of here ! Listen to me ! Do you want your revenge , or do you want your people alive ? Grab the keys . She 's gonna send for reinforcements . Until we find it a host , we won 't know how to stop A.L.I.E. Then let 's find it a host . Once we find Luna , this 'll be over . Ontari 'll be exposed as a fraud , and the A.I. will tell us how to shut down A.L.I.E. What will you do with Clarke ? I will give her the same choice as the rest . Luna , you 're the last Nightblood . Will you take it and become the next Commander ? No . Now what ? Rover 's almost charged . We need to pack up . We 'll be home soon . Then what , run away ? We 're not running away , Clarke . We need to regroup with the others , and find another way to defeat ... There is no other way . We need to find a Nightblood . We need to unlock the Flame . It 's the only way to stop A.L.I.E. What do you expect us to do , Clarke , walk into random villages asking for their Nightbloods ? If that 's what it takes . No , Clarke . If A.L.I.E. can find us on Luna 's rig , then she can find us anywhere . I won 't help you destroy another innocent Grounder village . If we don 't find a Nightblood , there won 't be any Grounder villages or a home for us to go back to . That 's all the more reason we go there and make sure our friends are ok . She 'll be fine . Just let her cool off . I 'm sorry . Bring her to me with the Flame . Roan ? Looks like I 'm not the only one who 's been following your tracks . Give that back . Good-bye , Wanheda . Wait . You have a real gratitude problem . You know that ? Would you just hear me out ? I need to find a Nightblood to put that in . I already have a Nightblood to put it in . Please just stop . Because of you , Ontari never ascended , so , no , I won 't stop , not until the Ice Nation has its Commander . You were saying ? Hands where I can see them . You ok ? Yeah . Then let 's go . - He 's coming with us . - The hell he is . Why would I do that ? Because we both want the same thing ... to put the Flame in Ontari . How do you know he 's not chipped ? If he were , do you think he would 've saved me ? Still , we need to be sure . Now we 're sure . Lock it up . Glad you made it back . We were getting worried . Where 's Luna ? Luna said no . Who the hell is this ? He 's Ice Nation . King of the Ice Nation , actually , and he 's our way into Polis . This way , Your Highness . You two , on me . We 'll take him to lockup . You want to use him to get to Ontari . - Yes . - What happened to his arm ? Bellamy shot him . Good luck getting him to cooperate . Sorry about your arm . Makes us even . Like it or not , we need each other . Cut to the chase , Clarke . You said we wanted the same thing . I want an Ice Nation Commander . And I can give you one with this . And why would you do that when you know she 's vowed to wipe you out ? We don 't have a choice . This isn 't just our war . The enemy we 're up against is after everyone , including the Ice Nation . The only way to stop her is to get the information off the Flame , and the only way to do that is to put it in Ontari 's head . The Ice Nation isn 't afraid . You should be . This thing doesn 't care what clan you 're from . It controls people , and it will take over the Ice Nation just like it took us over , one person at a time until there is no one left . It already has Ontari . I 'm listening . We need to disconnect her before she gets the Flame , or we 'll be giving A.L.I.E. exactly what she wants . To do that , we have to abduct her from the center of a city filled with thousands of people who 's minds are linked , all of them thinking as one . Whatever one sees , they all see . Whatever one hears , they all hear . I get it . So when do we leave ? Knockout gas , Mount Weather 's finest . As soon as they bring Ontari out , we put them to sleep . Nice . Because she 's chipped , you 'll have to EMP her like you did me before you give her the Flame . I thought Jaha destroyed all the wristbands . So did he . Then I came home . There 's only enough usable parts to rebuild one , so use it wisely . Made a few improvements , too . None of which is gonna matter if you can 't get us access to A.L.I.E. ' s code . You worry about the Nightblood . I 'll worry about A.L.I.E. How can you access code that doesn 't exist here anymore ? We 've got a plan . What are we waiting for ? Let 's move out . Be safe . May we meet again . Good luck . You got this . You were right . They 're using the king . Good . Then they 'll bring the Flame right to us . And we 'll be waiting . There it is . We stop here . All right . This is where we split up . The entrance to the tunnel is right over there . Yeah . We know where it is . I 'm gonna need the Flame . Look . This only works if they send Ontari out to get it . If they don 't see it , they won 't do that , not much of a trap without the bait . Fine ... but I 'm coming with you . No way . That is not the plan . It is now . I 'm not letting that out of my sight ... and I 'm the only one who knows the passphrase , so you can tell them that without me , Ontari can 't ascend . You 'll need to look like my prisoner . Ok . Wait a second . Give us a minute . Come on , Clarke . You 're really willing to trust that guy with your life ? No ... but you 'll be covering us the entire time , and I trust you . Pick a shelf . Raven said it would be here . What are we looking for again ? A motherboard loaded with ram . And that looks like ... A motherboard loaded with ram . Raven said she needs the processing power to open a portal into A.L.I.E. Portal ? That 's what she calls it . She wants to use one of A.L.I.E. ' s own chips to hack back in . All we have to do is enter the kill code we get from the Flame once we put it in Ontari . It 's game over . That old plan . Ha ! What if it doesn 't work ? It has to . So ... you and Harper , huh ? Uh-huh . I 'm happy for you . What , can 't be happy for my friend ? You haven 't been happy about anything in a long time . You 're right . I haven 't been . What happened in Mount Weather changed me . I blamed everyone for it ... Clarke , you . I 'm done blaming . I 'm glad you 're back , brother . Me , too . Wait a second . There it is . We can 't let Raven build the portal . We did it . Let 's go . Give me that . Jasper , we need that motherboard . Raven ! Raven , open the door ! What 's wrong ? Monty , what is it ? Japser 's been chipped . What ? Are you sure ? He stabbed me . Oh , my God . If Jasper 's been chipped , then A.L.I.E. knows everything . Radio . Rover One , come in . Damn it , Bellamy , pick up . It 's not transmitting . It 's not working . Let me in , Monty . They 're walking into a trap . Your friends better be in position . Move , move , move . Come on . Let 's go . All right . This way . This is it . Get these grates open . When this is over , Ontari will know you helped her . You have my word . Let 's get ready . Are we ever gonna be done fighting ? Hell yes . We 're gonna build a house on a lake ... and you 're gonna plant corn . Ha ha ! And raise chickens . Yeah ... And grow old . 11 o 'clock . Roan will signal when he sees Ontari . We wait until she 's standing in front of them , and then we launch the gas . They 're gonna be holding their breath , so we got to move fast . So much for the thousands of people . Anyone who gets in our way , we use nonlethal force . These people are not the enemy . They 're being controlled . The only thing we 're here to kill is A.L.I.E. - Is that clear ? - Clear . - Clear . - Good . Here we go . I am Roan , King of Azgeda ... and I have what the Commander seeks . I don 't like what I 'm sensing , so if she wants it , she can come to me . It 's Jaha . What the hell is he doing here ? - You see Ontari ? - No . Hold . Hello , Clarke . Your mother will be so pleased to see you . Who are you ? Where 's Ontari ? Not coming out , but you can give the Flame to me . I 'll be sure she gets it . Something 's wrong . Your friends in the tunnel can 't help you . Now give me the Flame . Back up , or she dies . Do it . Do it now . On your knees ! Drop your weapon ! Blake , against the wall . - Drop it . - Turn around ! Save the theatrics . We know you 're together . We know everything . Then you know she 's the only one who can activate the Flame . You 're right . We need her alive . Run . But we don 't need you . Hey . Don 't ! No ! No ! No ! You doing ok ? I think so . If it hit anything important , I wouldn 't be , right ? Right . You got lucky . We could use some more of that . Harper 's out there alone . Harper 's a guard and a better shot than you . She doesn 't know Jasper 's chipped . I know that , Monty . We can 't risk Jasper getting in here , not when A.L.I.E. knows what I 'm building . Raven , the plan failed . Clarke won 't be radioing with the kill code . I can find it myself . If I can get this to work , I can kill A.L.I.E. You tried this before . It didn 't work . I can do it . I have to . Come on , guys . Let me in . I just want to talk . As long as he 's right here , he 's not looking for Harper . So talk . You sound good . I 'm glad . I never want to hurt you , Monty . I don 't blame you . You were tortured . You got it wrong . I wasn 't tortured . I mean , yeah , I was punched a couple of times , but that 's not why I took the key . You should 've seen Luna 's rig , Monty . It was peaceful , safe . The people were happy . There was this girl there , Shay . When I was talking to her , I realized for the first time since Mount Weather , I wasn 't thinking about Maya . It was beautiful there , and we destroyed it . That wasn 't us . It was A.L.I.E. It doesn 't matter . What matters is that A.L.I.E. can take away all that pain . She can do the same for you . Please open the door . Don 't let Raven ruin this for all of us . How could you do that to us ? I realized the truth . They sent us all down here to see if the ground was survivable . From what I 've seen , it 's not . Let me go . You 'll be free soon enough . Clarke ... I 've missed you . I won 't take the chip ever . Right now , we just need your help with the Flame . What 's the passphrase , Clarke ? Stubborn like her mother . Hey . Hey . Let me go ! Mom ... Mom , please don 't let them do this . I 'm not letting them do this . I 'm doing it . What 's the passphrase , Clarke ? Mom , this isn 't you . I know you 're in there . Please . What 's the passphrase ? No ! It can stop , Clarke . Just tell us what we need to know . I told you . Her friends are her weakness . Start with Bellamy Blake . Let 's go . She wants Bellamy . Where are you taking him ? Leave her alone . O. , O. , it 's ok , O. It 's ok . You know , if I were you , I 'd hit the deck . Murphy ? Everyone hit the ground ! Fancy meeting you here . More will come . We have to hurry . You ok ? Thank you . What are you doing here ? You 're welcome . Nathan , you 've looked better . You haven 't . All right . You 're with Pike ? Only way we get out of here is together . He killed Lincoln ... put him on his knees , shot him in the head . O. , Indra 's right . We need every fighter we can get . You guys missed the part where it 's time to go ? We 're not leaving . We just saved your lives . Why do I think I 'm gonna regret that ? Clarke is in trouble . Clarke 's always in trouble . They took her and the Flame to the tower . It 's a safe bet Ontari 's there , too . Everything we need to stop A.L.I.E. is in the same place . If we go up that tower , we won 't be able to fight our way out again . If we stop A.L.I.E. , we won 't have to . Up the tower . Great . You know , after this doing the right thing can kiss my ass . Hey ! I told you , that is not how we 're doing this . They were in our way . These people are not our enemy . They 're being controlled by A.L.I.E. , and we can save them . There 's gonna be a lot more of these people if we don 't move . Let 's do this . I 'll bring it down . Once we 're up , you blow the elevator and then climb . Destroy the ladder behind us . On it . Come on . You do realize we don 't have a way down , right ? A problem for another day . Let 's go . Our ride 's here . Coming , O. ? If anything goes wrong down here , they 'll need my help . We got this . Push . Push . You get that we 're screwed , right ? A.L.I.E. already knows that we 're coming . This plan will work . Why are you here ? I 'm just trying to survive . You 're not the only one here trying to save someone you care about . Push ! Why are you looking at me like that ? Because I know what you 're thinking . Why is he still alive ? Because the dead can 't help us . He was my home . _ _ Well , that 's not good . Nate ! This isn 't you , Kane . I 'm sorry . They 're coming in . He won 't be alone . We have to hurry . Bryan , you all right ? Murphy , get that baton ready . Shock him , Murphy ! Murphy ! Back on the wheel . _ We 're about to have company . You want to bet ? We need to seal the corridor . Nate ... Take cover ! Come on , Murphy ! Shoot him ! Shoot him , Bellamy ! Thank you . Her friends are resourceful . We 'll have to improvise . John Mbege ... sliced throat , Roma Bragg ... spear to the chest , not as lucky as me ... Finn Collins ... death by Clarke , Dax ... death by Clarke , Atom ... This should do it . Acid fog , then death by Clarke ... Trina and Pascal ... gone . Yes ! Ha ! You 're in . It worked . We still have to get the kill switch - without A.L.I.E. finding us . - Ok . Connor and Myles ... choked on plastic , thanks to Murphy . Drew ... ninja star to the face . That was a good one . Why 'd you guys lock the door ? Harper , do you see Jasper ? Harper ! Don 't . Jasper , if you hurt her ... I know you care about her . All you have to do is destroy the machine , and she 'll be fine , promise . I don 't want you to lose anyone else . They 've got to be almost there . Keep pushing . They 're coming . _ _ Don 't be afraid . It 's not for you . No . Mom , Mom , stop . Listen to me . I know you can hear me . Just stop . You know how to stop this . Wait , A.L.I.E. If you kill her , you 'll never get what you want . A.L.I.E. ' s not killing me . You are . Mom , don 't do this , please . I 'm begging you , don 't do it . Please . What 's the passphrase , Clarke ? I can 't . I can 't . She 'll break . Do it . No . No ! No . No ! I 'm so sorry . They 're at the top . Let 's go . We set the bomb and fly . - 30 seconds . - Let 's go . The timer 's set . Let 's move . Indra . Kane , get back ! Indra ! _ They 're here . We can 't let them have you . I understand . What are you doing ? Wait . Stop . Jaha , don 't do this . Throne room 's this way . A.L.I.E. , stop it . Please don 't do this . No ! Damage to her brain is substantial , but she 's still alive . Bellamy , stop him ! Hey , are you ok ? Is she alive ? Is she breathing ? It 's ok . She 's breathing . Jaha has the Flame . Get it . We can 't let Ontari die . We have to stop the bleeding . - I got the Flame . - Her pulse is weak . - At least she 's alive . - Here . Hold this to the wound . Come on . What are you gonna do ? I need a flashlight . First , we take out the chip . Then we put in the Flame . Her pupils are unresponsive . What ? What does that mean ? She 's brain dead . She can 't give us the kill code . It 's over . We 're trapped here .

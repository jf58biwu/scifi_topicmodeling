 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Why do you want to rebuild the portal , Jemma ? Jemma : Because I have to get back there . I 've run dozens of simulations , the Monolith was just one option , though . We 're not gonna give up , okay ? Coulson : What is it ? Some kind of suspension gel ? It keeps them in stasis ... alive , healthy , just asleep . Strucker . Where do I find Ward ? I tried to do what Ward wanted . I tried to kill him . Professor Garner . [ screams ] [ growls ] 3x07 - Chaos Theory [ Hawaiian music plays ] _ [ camera shutter clicks ] [ chuckles ] Did you just spoil a perfect moment by capturing it ? You looked too good , sun hitting you like that . Ha ! Well , this time tomorrow , we 'll be home . Look who 's spoiling the moment now . What would you say if I didn 't go back to S.H.I.E.L.D. ? [ chuckles ] - You 're serious . - At least , not right away . So , is this the island talking , or are you ... I mean ... There are a lot of reasons why this won 't work ... - Why we won 't work . - Somehow I forgot how direct you are . - I don 't want to be one of those reasons . - And you won 't be . Listen , we 're older now and wiser . And I don 't plan on losing you a second time . So what do you say ? You want to go steady ? [ both laugh ] Weren 't we just talking about how we 're older ? Yes . All right , then . To new beginnings . To new beginnings . [ glasses clink ] [ chuckles ] I don 't know when Melinda 's coming back , Phil . We only got home a couple of days ago . Wanted to thank you for sending over Jiaying 's things from Afterlife . Coulson : Hopefully , it 'll help shed some light on our new Inhuman situation . I 'll keep you posted if I find anything interesting . And , Phil , I wouldn 't wait for Melinda to call you . Good advice . Thanks . All right . [ phone beeps ] [ coughs ] Oh , god . Oh , my god . [ gasps ] [ gasps ] Daisy : We 're not monsters . You can 't just lock us up in some ice prison because you don 't know what else to do . Coulson : No one 's talking prison . And , technically , it 's a gel matrix . - They 're putting people in stasis ! - Think of it as a medically induced coma , a way to hit the pause button until we find a better solution . " A better solution . " What does that mean ? The ATCU 's looking for a cure . I 'm not suggesting that 's for everyone , because it 's not , but some people might want to ... - We are not a disease . - I didn 't say that you were . You can 't just expect people to go through that kind of change and immediately have a handle on it . Do you remember how scared I was at first ? Yes . I also remember you iced yourself so that you wouldn 't hurt any of us . You 've got to admit , - things are getting out of hand . - I know . People are changing in uncontrolled environments ... I know , but everyone deserves a chance to be who they are . That 's where you 're wrong . You 're being seduced by your own experience . Just because you learned how to control your powers doesn 't mean everyone else will . I mean , what if a person 's hurting themselves or those around them ? - What ... What if they can 't stop ? - Take Lash . If putting a bullet in that monster 's head doesn 't do the trick , - then what ? - That 's not fair . That 's one guy . Most Inhumans fall somewhere between me and him . And that 's the message I 'm hoping the president and his advisors will hear when I meet with them today . The President of the United States ? It 's off the books , but the global community 's coming together to discuss the future of enhanced people . We 're meeting at Norad in Colorado . But S.H.I.E.L.D. isn 't supposed to exist . That 's why I 'm going in as a consultant for the ATCU . - So Rosalind Price ... - Arranged it , yes . We 're taking Zephyr One , picking her up on the way . [ sighs ] Are you sure this is a good idea ? We can 't afford to miss it . That 's why I want you to talk to Rosalind before the meeting . Win her over to your side of things . Could be a real start toward legitimizing S.H.I.E.L.D. But it might help if you can present a successful Inhuman case , one that 's not an extreme on either side . Joey Gutierrez is due for reassessment . I 'd be more than happy to check in on him , see how he 's progressing . - Couldn 't hurt . - I agree . I can send you my report while you 're in the air . - Thank you for your help on this . - It 's what I 'm here for . [ sighs ] No . I just don 't know why you 're calling me . All right . Give me your location . I 'll meet you there . - Dr. Garner . - Hey . Looks like you 're heading to the lab . - That 's a good sign , right ? - I 'm trying . We 're trying . Sometimes it just feels like it would 've been best if I hadn 't told Fitz everything . You did the right thing in telling the truth , Jemma . Secrets can eat you up from the inside . [ footsteps ] [ music ] - You busy ? - Uh , no . No . Sorry I haven 't been in here more . There 's ... There 's no need to explain . - What 's that ? - It 's my phone . I had it with me . Uh , I took pictures , made some recordings to document my time there . It 's quite damaged , but I kept it on me as a remembrance . - I was hoping you could ... - Recover the data . - It 's probably pointless . - Yeah , no . Maybe not . - Just thought if you saw it for ... - Myself , yeah . I always felt better having you as my second pair of eyes . Well , couldn 't hurt to try . I 'll get right on it . Thank you , Fitz . [ music ] But I didn 't know he 'd change into that thing . Bobbi : You worried about Andrew ? Or pissed that the Strucker kid went comatose before he could talk ? Well ... everyone at H.Q. says that Andrew 's fine . And as far as Hydra ... we 'll get them . I hope you stick around . Hydra 's not the only thing we 're facing these days . Between the Inhumans , this monster we 're hunting , and the ATCU on our ass , we need all the help that we can get . Monster ? Yeah . Big ugly thing , likes to kill other Inhumans . - You 've been tracking him ? - Trying . Transforms into a man , which makes him impossible to find . [ music ] May ! Hi . Oh , my god . It 's good to see you . - I-I got to go . - Go where ? I , uh , need to talk to Andrew . He 's doing a psych eval on one of the new Inhuman recruits . I checked the containment room . He 's not ... No , he 's at a training facility off-site . Where ? _ [ breathes deeply ] I can actually create things now . - And how does that make you feel ? - Excited , you know ? I have so much more control now . [ roars ] [ groans ] Dr. Garner ? Control . Yes . That 's important . Daisy thinks I could be a real asset to S.H.I.E.L.D. But she said my fate is in your hands . Yes , Joey . It is . Don 't put your shirt on for my benefit . Heard about your Hydra pool party . And here I was worried about you . Never liked Kebo much myself . Funny name . Locked me in a trunk . You all right ? - Of course . - Good . 'Cause taking out some of Ward 's key players - Brings us one step closer to finding the bastard . - No . Coulson 's busy with Daisy , so now is as good a time as any . Hunter , it 's just ... it 's not a good idea . Is this about Andrew ? 'Cause I thought we were past all that ... now that he 's all right , I mean . Okay . Did things get slightly out of control ? Yes . But nothing I couldn 't handle , obviously . And everything I did was to protect you . Bob , will you stop for one second ? I don 't want either of us to go after Ward . You ... You 're joking , right ? Since when ? Whatever it is , lay it on me . I think you 've been reckless and stupid . - Can I take back what I just said ? - And for what ? So Ward won 't lay a bloody finger on you again ! That 's what ! Yeah , I 'm stupid , because I love you ! I don 't need a knight in shining armor , Hunter . I need you alive . [ sighs ] I don 't want to lose you . [ sighs ] Okay . You 're right . Or lose ourselves . Become so obsessed with revenge that we ... we turn into monsters just like him . [ breathes deeply ] [ music ] Never walked onto a flying base before . Guess I can cross that off my bucket list . So , where does the tour begin ? That 's actually up to Daisy . She 's gonna show you around . [ music ] [ machinery whirring ] [ music ] All : Happy birthday , Jemma ! Happy birthday , Jemma . It 's not the same without you here . Say hi to your parents for me , and I 'll see you soon . [ mouse clicking ] Wow . Two moons . Bloody hell . [ music ] [ groans ] Jemma : Fitz ... it 's possible I 'm on one of the poles , but it 's strange . The stars and the two moons , they keep disappearing and reappearing . But there 's no sun . There 's never a sun . Last time you saw me , I was a wreck . Now I feel ... empowered . [ chuckles ] That probably sounds stupid . Sounds like you 've grown to accept that this is a part of you . Honestly , as a construction guy , the idea that I could build in a day something that would normally take months ... - it 's unreal . - Or tear something down . Yeah . If I have to . Just like that . [ snap ] - Daisy 's trying to put together a team of soldiers , right ? - Mm . - To fight . - To fight evil . - I could be a real weapon against it . - A dangerous weapon . That 's what I 'm worried about . [ door slams ] - Man : We weren 't expecting anyone to ... - Melinda , what 's going on ? Take Mr. Gutierrez back to base . - Melinda , we 're in the middle of a session . - Dr. Garner ... Not anymore ! Do it now . Ma 'am , we have protocols . - Take care of them , then go . - Come on . [ door closes ] - What 's all this about ? - We need to talk ... once we 're alone . Lincoln : Thanks for coming . You can settle down . No one knows we 're here . You getting any sleep ? [ scoffs ] It 's kind of hard when I 'm being hunted nonstop . I 'm really only worried about the one who wants to blast a hole through my chest . If you 've got intel on the guy , why not call Daisy ? 'Cause I can 't put her life at risk , too . I went looking for my friends . And those who aren 't missing are dead . [ bird calling ] You 're telling me this why ? Because you fought by my side against that thing . - It eliminates you as a suspect . - Why would I be a suspect ? 'Cause you 're with S.H.I.E.L.D. Okay . I ... I 'm not sure I 'm following . Lash is in S.H.I.E.L.D. And with your help , I can prove it . Rosalind : I appreciate you showing me around like this . We built this module to help those in transition . It 's made out of adaptive material , so it can contain all sorts of powers . It 's also bulletproof , which comes in handy when people like you shoot at people like me . And you really think this is more humane ? Our goal is to observe people , educate them , - and , yes , it can take time , but ... - We don 't always have that luxury . But throwing people away like they don 't even exist is the answer ? - That 's not what we 're doing . - Sure as hell looks like it . Well , it 's not that simple . Just admit it . You 're afraid of people like me , afraid of our power . Absolutely . Do you even know your own strength ? Could you take down this plane , for instance ? - I wouldn 't do that . - But if you wanted to ? You could kill me right now . Mankind 's scary enough as it is . Some psycho gets a gun , and watch out . But now people are their own weapon . - Not everyone is like ... - " Some " is enough . That 's all it takes . - You only see the terrible things . - That 's not true . - I protect people ! - It doesn 't matter . How can you say that ? Because for every Daisy Johnson , there 's a Lash , and it 's ignorant for you to think otherwise . [ breathes deeply ] Melinda , talk to me . What 's all this about ? I need to know ... for myself ... - before anyone else gets involved . - Know what ? I saw your flight logs . I tracked your movements . You were within 30 miles of at least five Inhuman deaths . - Why are you looking at my flight logs ? - I pulled your medical files , too . Your blood work was deleted . Maybe Simmons accidentally ... You thought you covered your tracks , but you didn 't . Melinda , honestly , what are you getting at ? That Von Strucker kid was alive ! He didn 't die in that blast . I tracked him down . - He told me what you did . - What I did ? - So some kid says I ... - He wasn 't lying . The look on his face ... it was pure terror . What happened to you ? - You can tell me . - Melinda ... - Don 't lie to me . - You don 't want to know . - He said you were a monster . - Melinda , don 't ... How could this even happen ? ! - Melinda , stop ! - Andrew , please ! - Please ! - Stop ! [ thud ] [ breathes deeply ] It 's been three weeks , Fitz . If I don 't find something , if I don 't eat , I won 't make it . [ mouse clicks ] Fitz , hi . I don 't know why I 'm still talking with you ... why I 'm recording myself . You 're never gonna see this , are you ? I still haven 't found water , and it 's , um ... well , I ... it 's , uh ... I 'm having trouble focusing , and I 'm trying to stay positive . But I 'm scared . I 'm scared , Fitz . [ breathes deeply ] Do you remember when we first met ? I do . You were so quiet and pasty , and ... so incredibly smart , handsome ... [ coughs ] quite a strange feeling ... isn 't it ? ... never wanting to be without someone . You must have been so annoyed , me following you around all the time . No . Never . [ sniffles ] I imagine our dinner sometimes ... where we 'd go , what we 'd eat . I wonder about us a lot , actually . There 's this small cottage in Perthshire we drove by once when I was a girl , some ... some ... family holiday , and I don 't know why , but I ... I found it so lovely . I still think about it ... a place where you and I could have ... [ sighs ] But that 's that , I suppose . I 'm not sure how long this battery will last . I should save it , just in case , for more important things . [ breathing heavily ] But I 'll still talk to you on my own , if that 's all right . I 'll always be with you , Fitz . [ breathes deeply ] [ music ] _ [ groans ] Oh , thank god you 're awake . I am so sorry . I-I didn 't want to hurt you . I ... I panicked . [ breathing quickly ] Where are we ? We couldn 't stay there , not with S.H.I.E.L.D. I needed time to explain . You don 't know how many times I almost told you . I just ... I didn 't know how . - I didn 't ask for this . - Oh , god . What have you done ? [ grunting ] - Melinda , don 't ... - Unh ! Let me go ! Don 't do that ! I don 't ... I don 't know what I 'll do . Instinct will take over again ... - like it did at the convenience store . - Instinct ? Look , I didn 't want to hurt anyone , but I ... I didn 't know what was happening . You killed all those people . How ? - When did this ... when did ... - After Hawaii . Daisy 's mom kept records . I was going through them for any insight , for research . And I found a book . It had all these names of Inhumans . Now , Jiaying must have rigged it with a Terrigen crystal to keep out anyone who couldn 't survive the mist . Lucky me . [ cracking ] At first , I was relieved . I survived . But I knew something had happened . I felt sick and nauseous . There was this intense pulsing , like my heart was in my head . [ breathes shakily ] I felt different , like ... like a part of me was unlocked . Unlocked ? I don 't know how else to ... I just ... I had to ... it was as if I was compelled . I had to be near them . The Inhumans . I didn 't know why . It was ... it was intense . I had this new desire . I had a ... a ... had a hunger ... on my skin . It wasn 't until I finally met one that my body took over , and I ... I lashed out . And then I felt relief . - But with you ... - Andrew ? [ knock on door ] You in there ? You wouldn 't understand . I had to keep you away . - That 's why you ... - Yeah , I was a coward . I wanted to tell you , but I was worried that ... you had ... you had to know . I didn 't end things with you because I don 't love you . I did it to protect you . I 'm still in love with you , Melinda . And I need your help . [ music ] Coulson : And where did they go after May dismissed the security detail ? Update me as you know more . [ cellphone beeps ] - Everything all right ? - Not sure yet . Could be as simple as a workplace romance gone wrong . That doesn 't sound simple . I think you were in the middle of telling me what great friends you and Daisy are now . I may have overstepped . But one thing 's for certain ... that girl 's got fire . And you still haven 't told anyone about her ? I keep my promises , Phil . They have no idea . - New look ? - Old look , actually . - It 's been a while , though . - Uh , may I ? Oh . Sure . So ... you gonna tell me what really happened ? 'Cause I 'm not quite buying the shark-attack bit . You 're not buying that ? One of my men cut it off . Saved my life . By chopping off your hand ? You kind of had to be there . - Does it hurt ? - Every day . Phantom pain . The thing that 's missing is the thing that you feel the most . - Makes it hard to forget . - So maybe you don 't . But it 's also important to look ahead , see what 's in front of you . [ door opens ] - We close to Norad ? - No . Another Quinjet 's requested to dock . Lincoln , what are you doing here ? Coulson : Where 'd you find him ? He came to me . He 's got intel on Lash . - She ATCU ? - We 're working together now . Yeah , we all want to catch that thing . Well , Mr. Campbell , you 've come this far . What do you have to say ? Those of us from Afterlife , we were trained to blend in . - Afterlife ? - I 'll explain later . And yet that thimg keeps finding us , killed most of my friends . Lincoln gave me names . I checked them against the bodies we could identify . That 's how I knew Lash was using Jiaying 's ledger to find us . - Her ledger ? - She kept a genealogy of Inhumans . She was the only one allowed to use it , until ... Until S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it . And there 's only one person I know who had access . Dr. Garner ? But there 's no way . It 's not possible . I didn 't want to believe it , either . So you 're not ... just saying Andrew has the ledger . You 're saying ... I saw May access his flight logs this morning . I talked with her . She was upset , but I thought that she ... She and Andrew are missing . I just got word . Oh , God . Reroute the plane ... New York . Pull all the satellite footage from the Cocoon . - We need to find them . - Yes , sir . I can 't believe I 'm saying this , but ... the president 's gonna have to wait . Whatever you need , I 'll let them know . - Andrew wouldn 't hurt her . - He 's killed dozens of us . Yeah , well , what if he doesn 't know what he 's doing once he turns ... he ... he blacks out or something ? Inhumans can 't change form . That 's not how it works . - I saw it myself ! - No , what I 'm saying is , it 's temporary . He won 't always be able to shift between monster and man . He 's still in transition . Becoming Inhuman . - And when that transition 's complete ? - He 'll stay Lash , permanently . The man you think you know is disappearing , if he 's not already gone . May : Andrew ... if I hadn 't shown up ... were you going to hurt Joey ? [ scoffs ] Of course not . And you know I 'd never lay a finger on Daisy . But you went after Lincoln . That kid has a dark side . You understand more than anyone . - Look at what happened in Bahrain . - What ? You saw firsthand what Inhumans were capable of . If you hadn 't killed that little girl , everyone around you would 've suffered . They all would 've died . But you saved them . This isn 't you ! You would never say that . No , Melinda , I know exactly what I 'm saying . You and me ... we 're the same . That 's why I need your help . - I never wanted to hurt that girl . - I know . I know , and believe me , I don 't want to do what I 'm doing , either . I have to . [ music ] I know you think I 've lost myself . I haven 't . - I don 't know what to do . - I know . [ chuckles ] Do you remember our first apartment ? - The one on Cranbrook . - One room , a stupid futon for a bed , and that winter when it got so cold , we ... We used the oven as our heater . And not the safest way to keep warm , but ... it did the trick . Melinda ... [ inhales sharply ] The world has gotten more complicated , hasn 't it ? I know we can 't pretend it all away . But I 'm still the same man you fell in love with . I never gave up on you . Please don 't give up on me . [ music ] Coulson : Sorry to interrupt . - Still waiting on Joey 's reassessment . - Phil ... - you don 't understand . - I 'm starting to . You all right ? We 're old friends . That 's why I 'd prefer to see everyone walk out of here unharmed . But in case you got something else in mind , I 'm not alone . - Containment module 's secure . - Copy that . Hall team 's getting into position . Remember , this is Coulson 's op . We do not move unless he gives the order . Go . He 's not gonna come quietly . Coulson : This doesn 't have to go down badly . I 'll make sure you 're taken care of . I understand the position you 're in ... I do . And I don 't envy it . But I am trying to help you . We 've got an outbreak on our hands . - What the hell does he mean by that ? - Daisy : Calm down . - Coulson knows what he 's doing . - Lincoln : You sure about that ? I 'm simply trying to sort the good from the bad . You gave me this job . That 's a pretty poor interpretation of a therapist . Look around you . We 're in some abandoned building , May 's tied up ... you 're not okay . I know how it looks , but I have a moral responsibility ! You 'll see , soon . [ chuckling ] I 'm doing you a favor . - He 's insane . - That 's not true . He 's just sick . The beast 's gonna come out , and you can 't control it . Don 't make things worse 'cause you got an axe to grind . He 's not just gonna let us take him . He 's gonna defend himself . Do not engage . We move on Coulson 's order . I 've only killed those who deserve it . [ electricity crackles ] Who the hell made you judge , jury , and executioner ? - What are you doing ? - You 've got to get him out of here , now ! - Coulson : Lincoln ... - You tore my friends apart . You have no right ! - That 's enough . - Calm down , Andrew , please . I have every right . Andrew , listen to me . We can help you . [ electricity crackles ] The ATCU is close to a cure . [ grunting ] [ music ] I am the cure . No ! [ shouting ] [ grunting ] Lincoln and Lash are in the East wing of the building . We have to get him to the module . Mack : On it , sir . - Phil ... - Our goal is to capture , not kill . We just got to get Lincoln on the same page . Try those . [ panting ] [ electricity crackles ] [ shouts ] [ both shouting ] Oh ! Really got to commit to that shotgun-axe idea . - Could use a little help here ! - What 's your twenty ? [ grunting ] [ grunts ] Andrew ... we 're friends . [ grunting ] [ electricity crackles ] or maybe ... maybe just acquaintances . We got him . [ music ] Aah ! Aah ! [ choking ] [ choking ] No ! [ screaming ] [ rumbling ] [ music ] [ panting ] Thank you . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - I didn 't know you could do that . - That makes two of us . - Where is he ? - No idea . But we got to get him to the containment module ... now . [ music ] I 'll get him to where he needs to go . [ grumbles ] Unh ! [ growls lightly ] - Andrew , stop ! - Move . Go on . Might as well . I 've thought about my death enough times ... the different ways that I could go . I just never thought it 'd be you . I never knew why you married me . I was never as ... kind and empathetic as you . That 's why it was so easy for me to walk away ... [ groans ] ... why I gave up on you . I lost something when I left you . I won 't do it again . But you have to stop this . Melinda ... [ music ] [ air rushing ] How 'd you know that wouldn 't kill him ? I didn 't . [ keyboard clacking ] I bloody knew it . - Fitz , you all right ? - Yeah , I think I 've , uh ... remember this ? - Yeah , from the castle chamber . - Okay . Oh , is that the other man ? Well , I 'm just gonna say what we 're all thinking ... - he has a hog face . - He does have a hog face . Okay . So , look at the logo of the space program he 's with . [ keys clacking ] And if you turn it upside down , they look similar , yeah ? - Bit of a stretch , mate . - Possible . Okay . Well , um ... what if the group who carved this symbol into the chamber door is the same group that sent Will through the portal ? I thought NASA sent Will through . - Could go beyond NASA ... way beyond . - Please don 't tell me you think some ancient order 's behind all this , 'cause that 's a bit mental even for you . I know how it sounds , but we 're dealing with a portal that leads to another planet , so ... Anything 's possible . It 's worth checking out , Fitz . You gonna take Coulson up on his offer , stick around for a while ? Can 't run forever . If we put Andrew in stasis as a human , it 'll slow his transformation , giving us more time to find a cure . Now , I can 't pretend to understand what you 're going through , but for what it 's worth ... if I had the chance to save someone I love , I 'd take it . What would you do ? Well ... it 's a temporary solution . I think we can all acknowledge that . But Andrew helped me . So I 'd ... I 'd do whatever it takes . Do it . [ music ] [ sighs ] Do you need to go after her ? [ breathes deeply ] She wouldn 't want me to , not right now . - It 's been a long day . - Mm-hmm . - Buy you a drink ? - Please . Hey . - You okay ? - I couldn 't sleep . There aren 't a lot of windows in the base , and I wanted to ... Watch the sunrise . I , uh ... I can 't make any promises , but I think I may have found something . - Might help us open up the portal . - Really ? And , um ... fixed your SIM card , so ... I heard your recordings and saw your video . Didn 't know you thought about settling down in Perthshire . [ chuckles ] - That 's in Scotland . - I know where it is , Fitz . [ breathes deeply ] So when you said all those things about ... I mean , you were tired and dehydrated . I was as clearheaded then as I 've ever been ... when I said all those things . What do you think we should do about it ? For now ... let 's just watch the sunrise . [ music ] [ glasses clink ] [ chuckles ] [ both chuckle ] - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . I never thought I deserved this . - What , a trip to Hawaii ? - No . Happiness . This kind of happiness . Of course you do . - We both do . - Mm . [ music ] Coulson : We 'll return in a moment . [ music ] - So , why am I here ? [ sighs ] - We 'll get to that . It 's a shame about ... Werner Von Strucker . I hope , for your sake , he doesn 't wake up . I 'm not worried . He 's weak , like his father . Ah , careful , Mr. Ward . You paid a price for that boy . You should ask yourself if it was worth it . - You gave me his location . - I gave you what you asked for . I 'm just ... not sure that you 're asking for the right things . Revenge only provides a temporary pleasure . - Ah . But a pleasure , nonetheless . - Ah . [ chuckles ] - You should think on a grander scale . - Oh , it 'll be grand . How about I cut off the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Because without Phil Coulson ... S.H.I.E.L.D. won 't grow back . [ chuckles ] [ cellphone ringing ] Ohh . [ cellphone beeps ] Excuse me a moment . - Ms. Price . - I wanted to apologize for missing our meeting at Norad . I will bring him to you soon enough . Time is of the essence . [ door opens ] Oh , I better go . I 'll be in touch . [ cellphone beeps ] You don 't have to leave so soon . How about some breakfast first ? - Are you cooking ? - I don 't cook . But I 'm an expert at going out to eat . Is there anything good around here ? Ruthie 's Diner is about two blocks away . She makes a mean scramble . - I think I can make time for that . - Good . [ chuckles ]

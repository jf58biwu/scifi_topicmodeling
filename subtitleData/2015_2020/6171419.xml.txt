 Bobbi , Coulson wants us to scout ahead . You sure about tose coordinates ? Kara . I had another vision . S.H.I.E.L.D ... . They 're coming . We 'd like to return someone of interest to you . We found these vials on him , ma 'am . What are these ? I know that you were separated from your daughter . You 're nothing like me , like us . You 'll get everyone killed . Mom ! This is war . Mom . Mom . Mom ! What happened ? Gonzales ... He ... he said that we were ... That inhumans should be exterminated . He had a gun . No , stay with me , please . Gordon will take care of him . Get everyone to safety . Everyone , this way ! Let me take a look at that . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s done enough . We have our own doctors . I 'll be fine in time . Right now we have more pressing concerns . You should get out of here . What about you ? Come on . Have you had any contact with Bobbi ? Her quinjet still hasn 't arrived , And she 's not answering communications . How 's skye ? Disappointed that you aren 't the one - Meeting with her mother . - Agent May . Sir , there 's been gunfire . Skye 's mother 's been shot , allegedly by Gonzales . I 'm afraid it 's going to get worse . What about Gonzales ? Where 's he ? I don 't know . Got what he always wanted . No . He wouldn 't do that . It has to be something else . Find Gonzales . Get everyone out . I don 't want to escalate the situation Till we find out what we 're dealing with . Have all three birds ready to fly the second I return . He may be a part of it . Make sure he 's secured . Agent May wants all quinjets ready for evacuation . Prep for takeoff . Something 's happening . The teleporter 's moving . We need to get you to the doctors . Okay . Come on ! Help me ! Why would you let them do this to us ? I thought you were on our side . I am . I-I had no idea , I swear . Jiaying , I 'm here . We got to get you out of here . Skye , stop ! What have you done ? That 's what we 're trying to figure out , But you need to stand down . After Gonzales just shot my mom and declared war on us ? You 're the one who needs to stand down . I need to see Gonzales . Where is he ? We can fix this . It 's too late to fix this . Now take your men and get the hell out of here . Not until I see Gonzales . I don 't want to hurt you ! You won 't . Stop wasting time , Skye . Help me fix this . I 'm sorry , May . You 're not welcome here . And my brother 's been on me for years ... Wants us to motorcycle down to Baja . Beaches and desert ... You 'll get bored . Truthfully , bored would be a nice change of pace . So ... There 's nothing I can say ? To change my mind ? No . I just need some time to figure out my next move . Harris , what happened ? Gonzales is dead . What ? When ? At the sit-down . That 's what people are saying . We 're waiting on orders . ♪ I 'm half-crazy ♪ All for the love of you ♪ No , sir , we 're still sorting out what happened with that quinjet . ♪ It won 't be a stylish marriage ♪ our priority was to get All S.H.I.E.L.D. Personnel out safely . ♪ I can 't afford a carriage Was there any resistance to that from the locals ? No , they seemed as keen on leaving as we were ... Perhaps retreating to shelters or bunkers . Or they evacuated . We know they have a powered way out . May . Where 's Skye ? How are you feeling ? I have a headache , and I asked a question . None of this would have happened if Gonzales hadn 't attacked . You can 't actually believe He would do something like this . Oh , no , Gonzales would never attack a base unprovoked . Robert did not do this . How can you be sure ? For me to get a gift for Jiaying , a peace offering . I agree . Gonzales was smarter than this . I recommend we respond with a strong show of force . I have no intention of starting a war Agent Weaver , you 're now the highest-ranking officer on the carrier . I want you to head back there and await further instructions . I don 't believe that Skye would turn against us . You didn 't see her fight me . Her mother had just been shot . I can believe she 's confused . Why invite S.H.I.E.L.D. Only to attack ? I don 't know , but maybe their peace offering over there does . ♪ But you 'll look sweet ♪ upon the seat of a bicycle made for two ♪ I thought that with her healing powers , the pain ... Wouldn 't be there ? No such luck . Her gift can heal the tissue damage with time , But she feels all of it . Does she need any blood ? I can ... I-I can donate or ... or what ... I think you 've helped enough . What is that supposed to mean ? It means Jiaying was right ... S.H.I.E.L.D. Couldn 't be trusted . But you convinced her otherwise . Why ? You think I knew about any of this ? Lincoln . Skye . I never meant for this to happen ... I swear . I should have been more careful . S.H.I.E.L.D. Has done this before . I hoped they had changed . Skye feels as betrayed as we do , Lincoln ... maybe more . I don 't think we know the full story . Coulson wouldn 't do any ... I can 't do this right now . I 'd like everyone to leave . I need rest if I 'm going to heal . Her phone 's not picking up ... Not even voicemail . Flight records suggest that Bobbi 's quinjet left Before the other three . There 's no indication of a crash . The transponder 's offline . Uh , it 's possible that somebody disconnected it , though . Forget about the plane . Can you pull up the Before she left ... good idea . You know , I am capable of finishing my own ... Sentences . Yes , you are . I 'm sorry . You knew , didn 't you ? Your visions ... You saw fire , destruction . You knew it would all fall apart . I 'm afraid so . Everyone thinks flowers are so delicate . They really are quite resilient . I 'm not here to talk botany . No , you 're here to ask questions about what 's gonna happen next . Yes . Because even if I were inclined to tell you , You wouldn 't believe me , not with our history . Forget history ... I don 't care about the past . Just ... Because the past and the future are intertwined , just like us . Our paths have been intertwined since before we even met , And I 'm not talking about DNA . You and I have spent our entire lives searching for our destiny , And I finally have the answer . I had a vision today , and it revealed the truth . I 've seen it . Tell me . You wouldn 't believe me . Raina . It is the Thorn that protects the Rose . Or , in this case , the Daisy . Please , stop with the metaphors . It 's not a metaphor . That 's the irony . My true purpose , my ... Destiny Is to help you become ... What you 're supposed to be . Why the hell did I even come here ? Because you want answers . You 're just not willing to hear them . In fact , we 'll never speak to each other again . But ... You 'll see . Your mother isn 't leading our people ... She 's misleading them . It 's you who are destined to lead . Even in the darkness , you 'll see the truth . The evacuation ? I 've taken everyone that needed protection back to their homes . The rest await your orders . I 'm confident Lincoln will fight with us , as well , When the time comes . He 's convinced S.H.I.E.L.D. Is the threat . That 's true of everyone . Your plan worked . They 're all willing to fight because S.H.I.E.L.D. Attacked . What about your daughter ? I 'm hopeful she 'll do the right thing . We 've gone to great lengths to ensure it . First , I need to get better . I need to heal . I 'm so sorry . You want to tell me what you 're really doing here ? Sure . I 'm a present , a gift horse ... A peace offering from my family . I 'm also an excellent Shanghai rummy partner . Sir , I 'm worried he 's more of a Trojan Horse . I believe cal took these before he was handed over to us . I 'm going to analyze them in the lab . Go . Have we lost Skye ? We didn 't lose Skye . She chose . Okay , that 's May . Yeah , and that 's the woman That once set my 1967 convertible GTO on fire . The question on the table is not who , but where . Okay , I 'm working on it . Okay , uh , this is time-stamped 10 minutes later . Wait . That 's may leaving the base again . It 's agent 33 . What would she want with Bobbi ? You know why you 're here , but I want to hear you say it . Sure , I 'm here because you 're a twisted psychopath , And once ... Wrong answer . Shouldn 't waste your energy , baby . We 'll stay here as long as it takes . We 'll get her to admit what she did to you . Sunil Bakshi gave up some surprising information When we were finding closure with him . He said that you knowingly Handed Agent Kara Palamas over to Hydra , That you are the reason she suffered months of torture And mind control at the hands of her enemy . You are here to confess that truth , To give Kara the closure she needs to move on ... To heal , the way I 've healed . Good luck with that . It 's not luck that 's gonna help us . Kara tells me you don 't like needles . How are you even up ? A skilled doctor , the generosity of others . Honestly , having you here Is the best medicine I could hope for . Okay , but I 've been shot before , a-and this I-is ... Inhuman ? What 's wrong ? Everything . S.H.I.E.L.D. Attacking , you getting shot , Me fighting may , the threat of more people dying ... This is way up there on one of the worst days ever . And I talked to Raina . She warned that bad things are gonna happen . I was hoping she 'd have answers . Thought you didn 't trust her . I don 't , and I shouldn 't have gone . She 's full of lies , and she 'll never change . We have more pressing work ... The safety of our people . How ? S.H.I.E.L.D. Can find us anywhere . Which is why we have to stop hiding and fight . You want to take the battle to S.H.I.E.L.D. ? You 've seen more clearly than anyone How they treat people who are different , who have gifts . If our people are ever going to be safe , I need you standing by my side . I know it 's a lot to ask , and there 's little time . Bring this back to me if you decide to join our fight . Skye 's mother orchestrated the whole thing . It was a performance . The quinjet they stole only fired on the one building . Nobody got hurt . Except commander Gonzales . It either killed him Or destroyed any evidence of foul play against him . If it 's theater , it worked . That S.H.I.E.L.D. Attacked their leader and declared war . Including Skye . Then mark that down as the second time S.H.I.E.L.D. Got played today . Figured out what happened to Agent Morse . She left on a quinjet with ... You . I didn 't leave with Bobbi . That 's ... Agent 33 . Stashed him under a blanket in vault C , Then boarded a quinjet posing as May . But why ? I don 't understand . The quinjet 's transponder went dark Outside Aranda de Duero in Spain . I 'm gonna need a pilot . With pleasure . This reeks of Ward . He left Agent 33 here for this very purpose . But why take Bob ? Did she have a history with him ? Not that I know of , but Ward 's logic is rarely logical . There 's a piece we don 't understand yet . There 's a piece that Ward doesn 't understand . When I find him , I 'm going to kill him . Glad we 're on the same page . Any agent worth their salt Adjusts to pain ... Can push it away . So I took a different approach ... Paralytic combined with an anesthetic . You can 't fight what 's happening , Nor can you feel any of the pain ... Yet . Crazy , huh ? Now , in a little while , the drug will turn off . Everything you 're not feeling will , Mnh , flood in at once . It 's how I felt after the mind control was removed . I remembered every terrible thing they did to me . Now , we can avoid all that pain if you cooperate . Admit your sins . What happened to you was a tragedy . Not good enough . I had to make a choice when I was inside Hydra ... Protect my cover by giving them a S.H.I.E.L.D. Safe house That might be occupied or blow my cover And lose intel that I knew for a fact Would get two dozen S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents killed . So you did sell me out . I 'm sorry you were in that safe house , But I did the right thing . The lives of the many outweigh the life of one . You ... you swore to the same ideal when you signed to S.H.I.E.L.D. That 's your apology ? Oh . I 'll go one better . If I ever apologize or beg for mercy while you torture me , Know that I don 't mean a word of it ... not a word . I made a hard call . I 'd make the same one again right now . They destroyed the device we used to track the teleporter . Not knowing their next move is exactly why S.H.I.E.L.D. Needs to end this before it goes any further . I agree that losing the tracking device Their compound 's been all but deserted . Doesn 't mean we can 't strike . Until I know more , I won 't be forced into action . Agent Skye ? She could expose us . She knows every S.H.I.E.L.D. Procedure . You 're gambling with our lives because of one agent . The security of S.H.I.E.L.D. Far outweighs the safety of Skye . It 's not her safety ... It 's her usefulness . Mack , I thought you left . I did , but with Gonzales dead , I need to see this settled first . So , you agree we should attack ? No . I agree it needs to be settled . I 'm not sure whether I 'm happier you haven 't left yet Or that you agree with me for once . I understand Skye could be a threat , But she 's also our best bet for resolution . Give me a few hours to gather more information . Three hours . We 'll continue gathering intel on this side . Is there a problem ? Only time will tell . What about the alien thing in the cargo hold ? Could be what this is all about . I 've already doubled the guard . You used to be chief engineer . If you 're sticking around , make yourself useful . This ship needs to be battle ready . I 'm not a Polar Bear , Phil . So why is it colder than bloody blue hell down here , huh ? And , uh , what 's with the , uh ... The doodad on my wrist , huh ? That doodad monitors your vitals . I 'll get you another blanket if you 'd like , Or maybe some hot Cocoa . Are you mocking me ? Torturing me after I willingly turned myself in ? Torture isn 't my thing , Cal , And surrender doesn 't really seem like yours . Why did Jiaying send you ? Do you have children , Phil ? Well , then , you 'll never understand Never imagine my pain when S.H.I.E.L.D. Stole my daughter . We 've been over this . It wasn 't S.H.I.E.L.D ... . It was Hydra . And didn 't you get your vengeance back in the day ? My understanding is you single-handedly Killed a whole lot of people . Oh ... I suppose that 's true . I 'm curious how you did it . With style . Tell me you figured out what drugs Cal took , Because my gut 's saying everything ever made . I haven 't fully sequenced the formula yet , If only for the multitude of trace drugs found , But my initial list includes Anabolic-Androgenic steroids , A Liver Enzyme blocker , various metabolic enhancers , What appears to be Gorilla testosterone , And ... no lie ... A drop of peppermint . I think it 's an ill-conceived attempt at super strength . Other than cap , every attempt has been ill-conceived . A single vial would send any normal man to the hospital . Skye 's father took three . He should be dead . It 's happening . She feels it . Once she understands your pain , We can all move past this unpleasantness . Don 't you see what 's happening ? He 's molding you ... The way that Bakshi molded you . The circle never ends . You left her for dead . I 'm helping her heal ... From wounds you inflicted . Then take her to Hawaii . Do you think it 'll end with me ? There 's always someone else to blame . You 're wrong . I bet he started you off easy ... Symbolic target ... Maybe the doctor who made your mask . Ward probably started off easy , too . You 're right . It was his dog . Garrett made him kill his dog . I know what you 're doing , Agent Morse , And it 's not going to work . Grant 's already told me everything ... Everything ... About his abusive family , About John Garrett , About having to kill victoria hand . But in the end , he overcame his family And the pain garrett put him through . He remade himself . It 's why I love him And why no matter what he does , I will always stand with ward . Thank you for meeting me , Raina . How are you feeling ? I should have listened to your warning about S.H.I.E.L.D. I hadn 't foreseen you getting attacked . I would have told you . These are dangerous days . I 'm grateful for your visions . You 'll be a valuable adviser . Adviser . Growing up , my dream was to lead the Inhumans . Life is rarely what we dream . I 've learned that more painfully than most . And now I 've come to accept it . It is not for me to lead , but to illuminate . I 've seen the future ... And your plan . Does it succeed ? There 's only one thing that can save the Inhumans From death and destruction . And it is neither you nor I. It 's Skye . I 've considered killing her and you ... running from my fate . But then , I realized ... What my grandmother used to say ... That one day , I would be an angel . And I realized her words have come true . I am not a monster . I am an angel . I 'm finally what I 'm meant to be . I 'm happy to hear you say that . Angels are guardians , Jiaying , But they 're also heralds , sent to reveal the truth . And that is my purpose . I 'm here to show the inhumans exactly what you are . Even in the darkness , they will see the truth . No . They won 't . How could you ? She threatened me . You tried to warn me , But I didn 't listen until it was almost too late . She knew I would see this . She said as much . She saw who you really are , so you killed her . Everything I will do is for the protection of our people . You killed Gonzales . You want a war . War was inevitable . I struck first so we would have the advantage . He came to make peace . Peace ? I built this community in the middle of nowhere So we would be left in peace . Yet , S.H.I.E.L.D. Found us . No matter where we go or what we do , they will hunt us down . If we are to survive , S.H.I.E.L.D. Must be destroyed . What are you planning ? I am planning for our future ... Your future . Daisy , I won 't live forever , And when I 'm gone , you must lead these people ... Protect them as I have done . Protect them ? You killed Raina . You are leading them into a war . If they need protection , it is from you ! I 'm sorry you feel that way . Restrain her . Take her with you . When this is done , hopefully she 'll understand . And dispose of Raina 's body . Could ... could I get a glass of that water ? Ohh . Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl ! May I have another one to drink ? That depends on your cooperation . They just want to live in peace . Is that such a crime ? Then staged it to look like we attacked them . Wake up , Cal . And your daughter 's gonna be caught in the middle of it . I don 't believe you . Neither of us would ever Do anything to hurt our daughter . No . But you 'd do anything to protect her . Look at yourself . Whatever was in these ... It 's killing you . Was getting rid of you part of her peace plan ? You got it all wrong , Phil . That little concoction is my own special formula . I took it of my own free will . You see , when my Daisy was stolen , I wasn 't strong enough to protect her , So I started experimenting . If I wasn 't born with Inhuman powers , Then I would make my own . Best-laid plans . C 'est la vie . I never got it quite right ... Always missing something . Highly unstable . Made me a little moody . Could it kill me ? Sure . But it was worth the risk . You 're here to take out some S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents . No . I 'm here to take out as many as I can . At least they didn 't crash . Maybe they both just needed a holiday . Bobbi always liked Spain . Probably sitting on a beach , Telling 33 what a lousy husband I was . I did have my faults . Hunter . That 's my Bob . Never goes down without a fight . What the hell does ward want with her ? No idea . But if anyone can handle him , it 's Bobbi . Gonna be a long night . I knew you 'd be tough . Coulson 's got a good eye for talent , Though he 's a little blind When it comes to spies in his own house . You know , you and I are a lot alike , Both of us living one life on the outside . But who we really are ... We keep that buried deep inside ... Where no one can ever find it . That 's why coulson never saw us coming . That 's why you never saw me coming . Where 's Kara ? Sleeping . Oh , but don 't worry ... I can go all night . I need you to help me help her . Kara needs closure . Admit that you betrayed her , and we can end this . You 're such a hypocrite . You say I betrayed her ? You betrayed your entire team . How many people who trusted you have died ? See , I 've seen the real Grant Ward , The one buried deep inside . He 's a coward who always has an excuse Or someone else to blame . You don 't know me . Sure , I do . Now ... Is there anything you 'd like to say to Kara ? Yeah . I 'd do it all again . This isn 't right . I 'm not feeling it . She doesn 't care if she dies , and ... She 's not sorry . It 's okay , baby . I know what to do . Hey , Mack , everything checking out ? I 'm headed down to machine room two to run a systems test . Copy that . Keep me posted . Where are the others ? If you hurt anyone here , Daisy will never forgive you . Stop calling her that ! Sorry . I thought th ... Never mind . " Daisy " to me and her mother ... Not you , not anyone else . Fair enough , but my point is she 's been led to believe That you 're a monster . Innuendos ! Lies ! Well , you did wipe out an entire village . They were trying to hide her from me ! It was Jiaying 's idea to destroy that village , wasn 't it ? She told you to take this . She didn 't care if it killed you . She 's using you to do her dirty work . No ! No ! More lies ! You 've always done her dirty work . She 's the real monster . She 's not like me . No . She 's worse . She 's not a monster ! Clear . No response . We can 't lose him . I thought you said he wanted to kill us . He 's Skye 's father . We have to try . I 'm doing what I can . Get me an adrenaline injector , one milligram . Fitz , I need it now . You were looking for a monster ? Everybody out ! Hmm . This is what I was missing . Cal . Cal , listen to me . Cal , I can take you to Daisy , but you need to calm down . This is me calm , Phil . Aah ! Fitz , I 'm open to suggestions . Icers are a good start . Agreed . Got to admit , I 'm not hopeful These will do anything but piss him off . There are more lethal solutions . Not yet . He 's Skye 's father ... Or at least , he was . I 'm hoping there 's still a sliver of the man who ... Uh-oh . Oh . There goes the feeling in my legs . Get out of here . No , sir . You ... Now , go ! Cal . Phil ... Time for you to go night-night . Time for the big sleep . Time to die . For everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. To die ! This is Jiaying 's plan , not yours . I 've always done whatever she asks . It makes me happy . It 's why she loves me . Careful with her . She 's unconscious , not dead . Just lock her up . We have to move fast . A day ago , I never wanted to talk to her again . Now she 's all I can think about . Love 's weird that way . I 'm not sure it 's love ... More like a dance of desire , Discomfort , and unreliable feelings . Hold on . Bobbi 's phone 's back in service . Shouldn 't be too hard to trace this to a location . Could be a trap . Been there , done that . Most of my marriage to Bobbi felt like a trap . But ... We did have our good times . So , you up for this ? If it means finding Ward and putting a bullet in his head ... I 'm all in . Guess love is weird that way . That was fast . Someone must really miss their honey bunny . You think he 'll come for you , hmm ? Since you 've shown no remorse for your sins against Kara , Since you clearly have no regard for your own life We 're leaving you a little present . First person through this door Brains everywhere . I wonder what you 'll feel When you watch somebody else die because of what you did . I know what we 'll feel . Closure . Ohh ! Weapons down or everybody dies . What did you do with Skye ? Follow me , and I 'll show you . I can 't wait to get off this boat . Hangar deck 's ours . I 'm headed down to secure the armory . I 'm also upstairs in the conference room . Comms are down . Engines are down . They 've shorted out most of the electrical on the ship . The crew quarters , as well as the hangar deck . Get me a secure channel to coulson at H.Q. We need to warn him . Copy that . Do we have anybody left still fighting below ? Director Coulson , we are under attack From an unknown number of gifted assailants . They have killed dozens of my men . We need your help . I 'm sending our ... Jemma , run ! Run ! Yes , let 's all run ! Now it 's just you and me . And we 're gonna talk . All clear . The ship 's been taken . Most of the crew have been secured on a lower deck . Anyone unaccounted for will be found on our next sweep . Now what ? Now ... We begin .

 - Previously on " defiance " ... - When an omec commander dies His children eat his vital organs and gain his strength . - So now his unhinged , unstoppable daughter Is at the head of 10,000 omec . - Under kindzi 's command The omec will attempt to conquer this planet . - It is time for our dread harvest to begin . - [ sobbing ] - [ growling ] - [ screaming ] - Come on , enchanters . Come and take a taste of datak tarr . [ yells ] - None of these are kindzi . He 's still out there somewhere . - With more on the way . - [ yelps ] - My father 's dead because of you . - He 's dead because you murdered him . - [ baby crying ] - What is that i hear ? - Please . Please . [ grunting ] No ! - No ! [ grunts ] [ baby wailing ] [ baby wailing ] - Please , i beg you , Spare the child , And you may take my life in return . - I do not require permission to kill you . - Then take the most precious gift i have to offer ... My free will . Spare this child And i shall love you as my enchanter . I will obey your commands , I will serve you , Pleasure you . And when my usefulness to you has ended , My body will provide nourishment . - Your offer is a good one , But i will still kill the child . - No , no , no ... - You 've upset my wife ! - [ screaming ] - How is she still alive ? - We should leave , go . Come on , come ! - Get to the roller . - Don 't make me trip . - Let 's go ! - [ growling ] [ engine revs ] - Are you all right ? - I am now . - She killed andina . You know , she would have killed us too If mom hadn 't kept her talking . You saved luke . - I did no more than any mother would have done for her child . No more than christie did . - Don 't push your luck . - You are healing well . - Forget my injury . Why are the skies clear ? Why are there no new arrivals ? - We had nothing to feed them . I thought it prudent we halt the protocol Until we had time to discuss the matter . As a group . [ speaking native language ] look at what the ursu sedolaz Have done to our family . There is but seven of us left . We must return to the ship . [ speaking native language ] - [ speaking native language ] And i will not be questioned ! You need nourishment for the hunt ? Eat this . - Omec cannot eat omec . - Are you refusing my order ? - Of course not ... [ speaking native language ] You honor us with this gift . Let us grow our strength , So we can hunt for food in town . - I will go reactivate the pods And bring down more of our family . [ indistinct chatter ] - Let 's start by focusing on the positive . - Good news here is that By cutting off the omec food supply We 've forced them to go out and hunt . - Yeah , but given that they 're hunting us , How is that good news ? - Well , we 've slowed them down . - He 's right . When the omec are first revived from the pods they 're weak . Eating makes them stronger . - There 's no way kindzi 's gonna bring down any more omec Unless she 's got something to feed them . - Or someone . - Okay , so we have a temporary advantage . How do we best exploit that ? - We sneak onto their spaceship and blow them all to hell . - That sounds promising . [ door opens ] - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Doctor yewll is working with the omec ! Nolan , get outta my way ! - Hey ! Stand down ! Yewll 's back on our team . - Yeah , you sure about that ? - Yes , i 'm sure . We 're all sure . - [ panting ] Okay . Okay , that 's a good thing . - All right , kids , gather around and pay attention . What we have here is the basic outline Of an omec harvester . The boarding party will be me Accompanied by three brave volunteers . We 're gonna hijack their ship-to-surface transit pods And arrive here , on the transit pad . - How do you know so much about omec ships ? - It 's entirely possible i 've done this before . We 're gonna go here , to the control center . We 're going to unplug the arkbrain And wire me into the network . A man in the engine room Is going to manually deactivate the fail-safe And shut the engine exhaust vents . This will allow me to overheat the engines And kaboom . Bye-bye , omec . - Are you sure this is gonna work ? - No . - Let 's say we 've succeeded , say we 've disabled the engines . What next ? - We run like hell and hope The descent pods still work . - How are the descent pods still gonna work Without a functioning arkbrain ? - Let me worry about that . - This is our ride home . - I said i 've got it covered . [ sighs ] this is our only shot . - You can either trust me , or you can sit on your ass And let the omec take the planet . What 's it gonna be ? Are you in or not ? - All right then , i guess i 'm in . - Me too . - And me . - No . It is out of the question . - T 'evgin 's daughter caged me . She threatened my family and my home . I will settle the score . If the mayor will have me . - [ sighs ] ship full of omec , A violent psychopath could come in handy . - Be my pleasure to serve . - [ speaking native language ] - How long before we can leave ? - I 'll need 20 minutes to prep . - Okay , you do that . I 'm gonna go address the town . People of defiance , The omec are no longer allies . They have turned on us . Their plan is to feed . To grow strong On the flesh of our people . To take the town of defiance and use it as a base , A launchpad from which to conquer the planet . No , we cannot allow this to happen . If defiance falls , The omec will have grown too plentiful , too powerful , For any force on earth to stop them . We must hold the line . I let them into this town , Sold our souls to get through a long winter , And for that , i am deeply sorry . - [ playful gasp ] [ baby babbling ] What do you see ? What can you see ? Huh ? - He really does like looking up at the clouds . - Yeah . [ chuckles softly ] - You 're really good with him . - [ laughs ] - You know when , uh , when this is finally over , And we 're safe , You could spend some more time with him , If , you know , if you want . - I 'd like that . - He really likes you . - I like him too . - Good speech . - Let 's hope it 's not my last . Next stop , outer space . [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ - [ speaking alien language ] [ gunshots ] - Filthy animal . - [ screams ] - Run , run , all of you ! Run ! - [ grunts ] - Stay back or this one dies . - [ whimpering ] [ struggling ] - let the kid go . Just put down the knife . Come on , just do it . [ groaning ] - Amanda . No , no . - Amanda ! - Amanda ? - [ groaning ] - Move ! Move ! - What the hell happened to her ? - Omec . - Okay , i need a heart monitor , a saline iv , And as many bandages as you can find--now ! - All right , set her up for a plasma transfusion . - Yes , ma 'am . - Lie still . - Doc , why- - - listen very carefully . You 've got a hole in your abdomen , And if you keep moving , it 's gonna reopen And blood is gonna gush outta you like christmas . So stay still . - Why haven 't you left yet ? - Because the omec are hunting everyone in town And i am up to my elbows in blood , missy . - You almost died . Doc saved you . Saved all these people . - Nobody 's life is important right now . Nothing 's important but getting on that ship And destroying it . I 'm sorry , nolan , but that 's true . You have to leave . - [ sighs ] It 's just not a party without you . - [ laughs ] - Wish me luck ? - Oh , you don 't need luck . You 'll be back . You always come back . And when you do ... - Then we 'll talk . - Yeah . - Amanda , i 'm a fugitive . No matter how this turns out , It 's only a matter of time before the v.C. Show up Looking to shove my head on a stake . - They 're not gonna execute The man who saves them from an omec invasion . - No ? - I 'll make sure of it . - Oh , well , that 's because they 're so reasonable , Those people from south america , so logical . - [ chuckles , coughs ] - [ sighs ] No matter what happens on that spaceship , This is my final ride . I know that , and i 'm okay with it . - You 're so full of shit . - Undeniably . - Mm . - And yet , throughout it all , You remain optimistic . - I do . [ romantic music ] ¶ ¶ [ groans ] - How is she ? - She 's strong . All right , come on , show 's over . Let 's get back on the streets . The omec are still hunting . We don 't want to give them any easy prey . - Okay , no pressure . Alak , you 're with me . - What do you say , doc ? You ready to fly ? - No , there 's no point in putting it off . - Where do you think you 're going ? - Someone 's gotta take amanda 's spot . - Yeah , well , it 's not gonna be you . - One rule . - Man , she uses that like a club . [ rockets fire ] - No rollers , no purple . Luck is with us . - Don 't get too cocky . A lot can happen between here and old saint louis . - Old saint louis ? Is that where we 're headed ? - Yeah , access tunnels in there . Kindzi set up shop in an old subway depot . There 's a launcher pad inside . It will take us up to the spaceship . [ engine whirs ] [ controls beep ] okay , i 'm online . We 're gonna go up one at a time . Who wants to go first ? - I 'll run point . [ grunts ] - Like i had to ask . Okay . I hope that you had a light lunch . [ engine firing ] - [ laughs ] [ dramatic music ] ¶ ¶ [ engine whirring ] [ engines roaring ] - No sign of any omec so far . They must still be in their sleeper pods . - I 've got a hell of a wake-up call planned . Let 's go . - What is it ? - Earth from here , it 's ... Beautiful . More beautiful than i ever imagined . - Nolan , engine room is that way . We 're gonna head topside to the control center . - I 'll see you soon , kiddo . - Yeah . - [ sighs ] - They have kids up here . - Evil comes in all shapes and sizes . - This is a child . - A child who would not hesitate To devour that grandson of mine you 're so fond of . How would that make you feel ? [ dramatic music ] - You 're going in there ? - I don 't have a choice . [ screaming ] - Was that supposed to happen ? - Just shut up and put the cable in . Neck port first . It 'll let me talk to the ship . - Are you sure about this ? - Yes . [ gasps ] [ groaning ] [ gasping ] - [ speaking native language ] - No , i belong here . - [ speaking native language ] - No , i belong here , you can 't make me- [ speaking native language ] [ machine whirring ] [ machine chimes ] - [ sighs ] okay . - What is that ? - Doc yewll 's orders . It 'll help you sleep . - No , no , pull it out . I don 't wanna sleep . - Shh , you 've been through a lot . It 's all right to take a moment . - Why are you here ? - To change your bandage . - Don 't do me any favors . You know you can 't work it off . Coming in here ... Playing florence nightingale ... Doesn 't make up for any of it . The town . The weapons we lost . The arch . The deputy you murdered . - You frustrate me . - [ laughs ] do i , now ? - I am uncomfortable with the reality ... That the person i most admire , The woman i respect more than any other , Despises me . - [ laughs ] I give everyone a fair chance . You had your shot . - You inspire those around you To be the best version of themselves . I saw it with kenya , Doctor yewll , Nolan . You have filled me with a desire To elevate myself in a similar fashion . I regret that i have fallen short . I regret that i can never be your friend . - I don 't think it 's me you 're frustrated with . - I suppose not . - [ groans ] - i 'm sorry . - Don 't be . You 're not the one who carved my guts out . - I 'm not apologizing for that . - Nolan , can you hear me ? - Yeah , doc , where are you ? - I 'm in their communication network .

Is there any way to stop the explosion ? - You gotta be freaking kidding me . You can 't stop the explosion . All of that energy 's gotta go somewhere . - Can we just vent it into space ? - Yeah , but only through propulsion And that would send us randomly slingshotting into deep space . We would be hopelessly lost . We 'd never find a way back to earth . - That 's kinda what i was going for , doc . Find a home for the omec , far from earth . - You coddle that kid of yours . You know that , right ? - Mm-hmm . - One last adventure ? - Live or die together . - [ gasps ] Nolan , don 't do this . - I 'm gonna miss you like crazy , baby girl . I am so proud of you .

" Take Me Home " playing The shocking injury suffered by the young man , Ludo Abbiati , last night only reaffirms this government 's commitment to keep these dangerous subhumans within the area known as the Zone . Minister , have there been any other reported incidences of attacks on humans living within the Zone ? None that I 've heard of , no . Humans who live in the Zone must carry valid IDs and are free to come and go from the Zone area as they wish . But Hairies who try and exit the Zone will be detained in other ways . The international community has accused us of violating human rights in our approach to the Hairy peoples , but our priority is protecting the rights of humans who are threatened by these dangerous and unpredictable creatures . Security at the checkpoint will be increased . The wall will be strengthened . And penalties for anyone who smuggles Hairies out of the Zone are becoming both harsher and more strictly enforced . The reward for reported sightings of subhumans will be doubled . We must all help to make this city a safer place in which to live . You reckon they saw us ? No , we 're all right . Keep going . We should have guns . Since when do you know how to use a gun ? I know how to hold one . Hello . It 's all right . We 're not gonna hurt you . Oi , I told you we should have guns . Mr. Koen ? Not mister , just Koen . _ _ It 's a little kid . I thought you 'd have shaved down . You didn 't give us much time to prepare . Hey , little one . Blair , get the bags . Why do I have to get the bags ? Get the bags . We need to hurry . Hey , you want to push the button ? Go on . In here . There 's a spare bulb under the sink . - Oh ! - Whoa , sorry . People can be animals , eh ? So you 've got hot and cold running water . Security cameras so you can monitor who 's coming and going . You got high-speed Internet . You know , you can order anything you want and you don 't even have to leave home . - You said three bedrooms . - I said I 'd see how it 'd go . So we get the one-bedroom price ? I 'm giving you the one-bedroom price . _ _ - Listen , Bundy . - Boondee . Boondee . Boondee . You told me you wanted to get out of the Zone , yeah ? Now , I know this place isn 't everything , but it 's almost everything . Put a bit of work in and this place will feel like home . I guarantee . And when something better becomes available , I 'll let you know , I promise . Nice doing business with you . Thank you . Jyra . Blair . Your share , my brother . You didn 't say there 'd be kids . Probably older than me and you put together . Oh , that 's all right , then . All I was told was I had five shavers wanting to bail out of the Zone . Maybe this time we should just let them be . They get three square meals a day , a roof over their heads , a nice warm cell . It 's good for them , better . Containment Authority . How may we help you ? Hello . Yes , I 'd like to report a sighting . - Subhuman sighting ? - Subhuman for sure . - A whole family of five . - What is the location ? Apartment 34 , Alberto Street , Windale . Do they pose an immediate physical threat ? No , no immediate threat . And what is your ID number ? 1688145 . I have you up . - Was there anything else ? - Nah , that 's it . Thank you for your call . Your reward is being processed now . Prepare retrieval process . Screw the embargo . We got a family this time . I 'll handle the minister . Get Belinda reporting . Tell her I want a human angle . Irony always comes included , you know that . The problem , as I 'm sure you 're all aware , is the Zone . If you want to get rid of the Hairy buggers , get rid of the Zone and people like Waruu West harboring Hairies . - They 're talking about you . - Back on the switchboard lighting up . Ah , I must 've said something right for once . - Belinda Frosche . - Hi , we have a CA team on . - Really ? How many ? - A family of them . A family ? What about the embargo ? - We 're being told to cover it . - Great . - Now what 's the address ? - Apartment 34 , Alberto Street . Get a camera team ready . I want to be first on the scene . ... have recorded a spike in arrests , - arrests of subhumans across the city . - Hey . Waruu , please . Okay . " Bad Apples " playing Stay on the ground ! Yeah , give ' em hell , Uncle . Welcome to the Zone . Oi , why aren 't you boys at school ? Why don 't you take it up with the education department ? How about I take it up with your mom , Jake ? Yeah , you said that yesterday , Uncle Waruu . You boys want to get out of here , you go to school . Not like me . Get an education . Get a job that 'll pay you half decent money . Yeah , whatever . Tell me tomorrow , hotshot . - Hello . Howdy . - Hey . About time . Running low on supplies . No triple antigen or tetanus . Everything else on the list I managed to find . - Hey . - Anything else ? Uh , well , yes , there is . That 's yours , isn 't it ? - Love the mag wheels . - Yeah , they 're not mine . Someone 's showing appreciation for the doc 's work . Don 't get gifts like that working in a fancy private hospital . I can 't drive home like that . You boys , switch the doc 's wheels back . - No way . No , that 's silver alloy . - Do it now . My work here is done . Thanks . This is the place . Set up over there . Hurry , here they come . Move ! Go ! Go ! On really hot days , the sisters would roll around in the cool mud of the billabong . And ate berries ? And ate so many berries that they had juice running down their cheeks and their tummies were ready to burst . Come here . Containment Authority . We have permission to search these premises . Open up . We will not ask twice . Containment Authority . We 're going in . Down on the ground . On the ground . On the ground . On the ground now .

Come on , up you get . Please ! Give me a minute . No , just shut up and listen to me . Now , you know you are prohibited from broadcasting anything . This operation was highly classified . 80,000 years the Hairy people have been on this planet . They predate our oldest culture . Spare me the sanctimonious bullshit . You 're about to run a snuff movie . You know what embargo means ? I understand the headache it 's gonna cause you , but the story happened and it makes great TV . And I run a TV network . A bit hard to run a network without a broadcasting license . Your party got elected on the promise of open and transparent government . And you want to knock our license out ? Go for it . I want the raid story leading every bulletin . Hello . Hey . I 'm trying to concentrate here . Your doctor seems to be working out . Community is starting to accept her . I didn 't think she 'd last . I 'll tell her you said that . And I 'll tell her you 've got the hots for her . Only one woman I 'm hot for . Waruu , better come see this . Djukara ! Shots were fired and Tasers deployed by Containment Authority officers while attempting to detain a subhuman group of four earlier this afternoon . Two officers were severely injured in the clash while a subhuman minor has been killed . - Not a child . - Father 's name was Boondee . They 've got nowhere to live , 'course they want to leave . And this is gonna keep on happening until ... Yeah , I know that , but I can 't just kick families out on the street to move Hairies in . I 'm already copping grief from my people . I thought we were all your people . A tip-off was made to the Containment Authority 's retrieval hotline number . Retrieval officers were then dispatched to the apartment block behind me . Trouble began when CA officers tried to separate family members . - Mom ! - No ! No ! Jyra ! Jyra ! As we were first on the scene , we have exclusive footage of what happened . And a warning to those at home , some viewers may find the following distressing . You gonna finish those invoices or what ? Djukara ! Get off him ! No guns ! Get off him ! Jyra . Hey , you catch the news ? - Kid was a subbie . - Did anyone see you ? - It 's cool . - They shot the kid . - No one knows it was us . - Hey , they shot the kid ! She is dead because of us . Come on , Koen , this is all wrong . Okay , you want to give the cash back ? Is that what you want ? Want to give it all back ? Close this place down ? Go back to stacking supermarket shelves ? I grew up in the Zone and I 'm making a future for myself . If you two want to walk away , there 's the door . Excuse me . Yeah , whatever you say , brah . Do I still have a TV network ? I want a prime-time spot from you . - On the " O 'Grady Show . " - You 've got it . And I want Waruu West with me . How does Tuesday sound ? - Geoff . - Charlotte . I hope my husband isn 't harassing you about something . Wonderful to see you again . Do you like the work ? I think you might like this one . " Coffee " ? Yeah , it 's a political statement about skin color . Oh . Thing about coffee , it 's always coffee . Drink it black , it 's coffee . Add a splash of milk , it 's coffee . Add a lot of milk , it still tastes like coffee . I 'm a flat white kind of guy myself . Yeah , he said it . You look ravishing . Help you , brah ? Are we related ? I need to speak to Koen . Koen . Uncle Jimmy , what are you doing here ? Phew . What do you got in the bag ? Something dead in there ? Take it . Go on . Your father would want you to have this . Hey , it 's not a toy . Sure , Jimmy , whatever . Give it to my big brother . You 're a man now , son . You need to start acting like one . Now you look after that . Okay . This is not a game . Time you decided which tribe you belong to . I 'm not planning on joining any tribe , Jimmy . I 'll be watching . Thought none of them talked to you anymore . He really your uncle ? Dad 's brother . What 's this thing he gave you ? Don 't worry about it . Separate the girl ! No , no , no ! - Jyra ! - Mom ! Hey , Jimmy . You walking a straight line there , brother ? Hey , Harry , you Hairy bastard . Got to see Waruu . - Bar that way . - Waruu this way . All right , fellas , bring it in . Bring it in . Bring it in . Once the fight 's done , the dispute 's over . Agreed ? Agreed ? We agree ? Agreed ? Hey , woman . Hey , who you calling woman ? Be me and you in the ring next . Let 's fight . I need to talk to you , mate . Later , Jimmy . After the fight , eh ? I 've done something really bad . What ? Look , we 'll talk later , Jimmy , yeah ? Koen 's gonna need your help , all right ? You look after Koen . Sure . Get up ! Get up , skin . You 're not done . Fight 's done . Fight 's over . You 're done , brother . Easy , everyone . We 're all brothers here . You all know that these fights are how we resolve our issues . Maliyan , this fight is over . I 'll say it again , it 's the Containment Authority , the government , they love it when we 're divided , Hairy against human . Why ? Because it weakens our position . Makes us easy pickings . That 's why we have to stay united . That 's why we have to stay together . Live by our own rules , yeah ? Yeah ! Has the money been transferred to the account of Mr. James West ? It has , sir . Thank you . It 's all sorted , Jimmy . Paid up front just as you like it . And everything 's ready at the lab . I 'll give you the spirit , but then I 'm finished . I 've had enough . Find yourself another Cleverman . _ Tequila Sunrise . $ 15.50 . Thanks . Not interested in her ? About to run out of beer . - I 'll go . - That 'd be a first . Stay with me . Stay with me . Koen ! You all right ? Oi , what the hell is going on ? We got a full bar out there . Koen fainted . He just ... he just crashed out . Hey . You all right ? Come on . Come on . Got a bit of blood in your eye . - You gonna be all right ? - Yeah , I 'm all right . I 'm all right . Hello ? Yeah . Yes , it is Nerida West . What ? Oh , no . Yeah , I understand . Sure , we 'll ... we 'll be down . It 's Uncle Jimmy . Only one thing I know does that . Eh , Uncle ? Namorrodor . It took his heart . It 's just stories . This is no story . It only turns up when things are out of balance . Who would hurt Uncle Jimmy ? That 's for the police to find out . You said they couldn 't find their own asses with both their hands . At the fight , what did Uncle Jimmy say to you ? Um , he just told me a story . You know , the one about the sun and the moon . The grandfather has to decide which of his two sons to pass ... - His knowledge . - Yeah . And he chooses the sun and that makes the moon angry and that 's why the moon only comes out sometimes because he 's jealous of the sun . Did I get it wrong ? No , you got it right . No way I 'm the moon . That 'll do . That 'll be good . I thought you 'd like it . What did you say ? We didn 't say anything . We 're doing portraits . Are you all right , brah ? All good . You 're the one that was fighting them , eh ? - What 's your name ? - Djukara . I 'm Kulya . This is Mungo . And you 're famous . My parents ? They separate everyone . Men one place , women another , boys another , girls another . We haven 't seen our parents for months . Move ! No talking . Get out . - Come on . - Get out ! - Come on , move . - All right , boys . Get ' em out . No jungle talk . Hurry it up , monkeys . Bring ' em in . - Move it ! - Left foot , right foot . Hurry up . Bend over , rug . Bend over ! So we always know where to find you . Suck it up , princess . Next ! Come on , monkeys , hurry up . Bring him in . Shut up . Down . A kiss from me to you . I 'm sick of saying it , Waruu . The Hairy people here in the Zone are living in third-world conditions . Kids have got nowhere to go , no running water . Spending every night in a shitty old train station is no way to live . At least here in the Zone they 're safer than on the outside . Up behind your fancy block of apartments , maybe . But down here , it 's a refugee camp for Hairies . CA still raid this place when they feel like it . You want them to stop calling the smugglers , you 've got to offer up something better . - Yo . - Yo . Waruu . Gotcha . Hello ? Who 's there ? Girl . Girl ! Little brother . Long time . Brought your girlfriend around , I see . Aren 't you gonna offer us a drink ? Sorry , no service . We 're closed . That 's all right . I can help myself . Good bar . You like trading in other people 's misery . What do you want ? Leave . Now . Get the ... get out of my bar . You 're not welcome . You made the call . You little rat . You Judas leech-sucking vermin of a half brother . Why should I care what happens to some subbies ? He 's the reason you should care . Next time , I won 't be able to save you . Fuck . Ah ! Somebody ! Help ! Blair ! Ah ! Give me a look . Let me have a look . - No . - Let me have a look . Blair , get something . He 's bleeding . A freaking Hairy ripped my freaking finger off . Okay , let me see . Koen . All right , it might not have gone through , but you 're gonna need stitches , okay ? It 's all right . Koen , your eye . - Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Oi , oi , what the hell ? What the hell ? Hey , did you tell Aunty Sal she has to move out of her flat to make way for Hairies ? That 's not what I told her . Yeah , it 's the way she 's taking it . And I 'm the one that 's copping it . Look , all I said was that we needed to get together to sort through the accommodation crisis . She 's got the other aunties worried , too . Just explain to them what I 'm trying to do . I 'm Jarrod Slade . I 'm very sorry for your loss . Your uncle was a fine man . - Sorry for your loss . - Thank you . Thanks for coming , you mob . We all know Jimmy 's been off the rails of late . But he was at heart a good man . Took me under his wing from a young age . Brought me up to know right from wrong . Jimmy always went out of his way for people . Hairy , human ... didn 't matter . For Jimmy , the Zone was his home and all of you were his family . A true ... Our Cleverman . He more than anyone understood the value of community . He would have died before he let anything happen to you mob . That 's what his life 's work was all about . And I hope as his next in line to do the same .

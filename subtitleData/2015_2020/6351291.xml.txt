 Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits , forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons ... rage ... grief ... fear . My God . Now , in order to survive , we must battle our most dangerous adversary ... the enemy within . Well , the sooner you become his mate , the sooner he 'll be what I need him to be : a protector . You and I , we 're part of something greater . You 're one of us . I 'm sorry , but I 'll never be able to be who you want . What happened ? What do I do ? Get me to the caves . Did that star just hit us ? Oh , my God . Looks like a meteor ! We have a way to fight the kinship . - How ? - Emotion . You all sure you want to do this ? Like you even need to ask , Red . Then the resistance starts here . 'Cause of you . When she comes out , you 're gonna answer for what you did . We 're all that 's left . At least we have food . Yeah , if that 's what you call this mystery meat . So this is my army ? A cripple , two horny teenagers and a plucky newspapergirl ? We 're the best you 've got . Yeah , world 's over . Sam took out Christine , the town 's on its own . We need a plan . We find a way to use emotion . It 's the only way to fight what everyone 's infected with . I 'll take bullets over group hugs , okay ? We found guns , we ought to use ' em . You do realize we 're outnumbered . Yeah , and they have weapons , too . And why would you want to shoot everyone when they can be saved ? Because I don 't know if anyone who came out of those cocoons is worth saving . And that includes you three . I 'm going into town to see how everyone 's coping without Christine . All right . We 're coming with you . Yeah , you need someone to watch your back . Hunter , keep working on cracking the passcode to Christine 's recorder . Whatever she said could give us an advantage . No , no ... he stays , I 'm staying . I 'm not gonna let some pod person stay here alone with our supplies . All right . Set these to channel three . We 'll keep you updated on what we find . You really think , this little recon mission 's - the best use of our time ? - I think if there 's even a shred of hope for the people we care about , we have to try . Don 't stop . Sam ... how far you 've fallen . Well , you deserved it . I 'd do it again . I could kill him . Just a quick snap , and he 's no longer a problem . No , I have other plans for him . Just kill me . I 'll never help you . Don 't worry . I can bring you around . He should be out for a while , but we need a private space to work with him where we won 't be disturbed . Our fallout shelter 's perfect . - What 's wrong ? - I 'm not fully healed . I used most of our energy supply and oxytocin just to get back on my feet . I don 't know if it was worth the cost . The kinship was lost while you were gone . You made the right choice . They need you . Do you feel different ? I feel like a weight 's been lifted . Did you see that ? Dale , what 's happening ? I have no idea . 3x08 - Breaking Point Joe . Look at the sky ! It 's coming back . Julia , pull over ! It 's like a TV screen , changing channels back and forth . From what 's real to what 's not . There you go . No way . How can she still be alive ? She must have gone into a cocoon after she was stabbed . When Barbie came out of one , all of his wounds were healed . I know that there 's been a lot of confusion over the past 24 hours . But the destruction that you witnessed outside the dome wasn 't real . It was an illusion . I projected it on the dome as a crucible , meant to bring us all together . To strengthen us for the tasks to come . If we could just show them how many times she 's lied to them ... No , logic 's not gonna work . They 're accepting everything she says without question . There are amethysts in these tunnels that need to be brought to the surface . We 've got some mining to do . Even Barbie 's buying it . So is my mom . Gather any picks or shovels you can find at Town Hall and meet back here . Christine has some sort of a schematic in her office . I don 't know what it 's for , but those amethysts are definitely part of it . Well , Joe and I can go find the schematic . Okay . Go now , while Christine 's still here . Take my car . Once you find it , get it to Bird Island . We 'll see if we can make sense of it . It might be the key to her whole plan . You know what ? Give me your walkie . Mine 's running low on batteries . What are you going to do ? Keep an eye on the mining operation . See what kind of information I can gather here . All right . What happened ? The situation is more complex than I let on . Yesterday , Sam stabbed me . I only survived because James found me and brought me to the tunnels . Well , you want me to track Sam down ? He 's already in custody . I need you to spearhead the mining operation . So why do we need these amethysts ? They power the dome . Like batteries . The egg kept them charged , but when it was destroyed , the amethysts began to lose their energy . And I used most of what energy was left to heal myself and to create the illusion that brought us together . If we bring the amethysts above ground , I 'm hoping we can recharge them . And if we can 't ? The dome 's surface will calcify . Everyone inside would suffocate . Okay . Well , then , we 'd better get started . Eva , I need you to set up a lunch station nearby so everyone can be fed without slowing down the work . Well , now , hold on . If you 're gonna be on your own , I want you to get a gun . We may have Sam , but who knows what other threats are out there ? That 's not a bad idea . I 'll grab one in Town Hall . The two of you seem closer than ever . Have you slept together ? Yes . But I don 't think he 's completed his transformation . You 're doing all the right things . Don 't worry . It 's just a matter of time . Look outside . Apocalypse has been canceled . It 's not the first time the dome lied to us . Skies are clear . We might be able to get a signal . There 's a message ... sent last night . " Emergency protocol . Confirm receipt and identity with employee access code . " Put in your access code . You worked for Aktaion . Hunter May . How goes dome life ? Do I know you ? Lily Walters . Your disappearing act got me a promotion . What happened last night ? The whole dome turned black until a few minutes ago . Our satellites couldn 't see inside . So no meteors landed ? The world is ... fine ? Enough of your chit-chat . I need to talk to the man in charge . I monitor all communication in and out of the dome , so you talk to me until I say otherwise . You think I don 't know who you are ? James Rennie , Sr. Aka Big Jim . Last update has you in Dr. Marston 's custody . And now you 're free , and I can 't reach him . You 've been a bad boy again , Jimmy ? I 'm one of the few good ones left . The people here are infected by whatever came out of that meteor egg , they killed your team . Marston 's still alive . Those , freaks captured him . Now , I formed a resistance , and I can get him back , but , we 're gonna need something from you first . Like what ? Care package . Hold on . Didn 't you kill Dr. Marston ? Yeah , but she doesn 't know that . The satellites can 't see indoors . Okay , I can 't make any promises , but what do you need ? Well , we managed to salvage some firearms , but those won 't be enough . So first we need something that 's more explosive . So we 're gonna split up into two groups , all right ? This group right here , you 're gonna chisel the amethysts out of the cave wall . Grab some tools . You guys , you 're gonna help us build a winch and pulley system over top of this hole so we can lift the amethysts out . Got it ? Let 's get to it . Come on . What the hell ? Barbie ? Barbie . I thought I made myself clear . You 're not welcome here . Don 't speak , just listen . Look , I know you 're angry with me , but I need you to think about something . When you were in the cocoons , why did it make me dead and have you fall in love with Eva ? Jealousy doesn 't suit you , Julia . Please just hear me out . That alternate reality needed to pull you away from me . Have you thought about why ? Well , I 'm guessing you have a theory . You 're being manipulated to be part of this kinship . The man I love should see right through that . Don 't turn away from us , from what we have . What we had is in the past . It should still matter to you . Look , what I have now with Eva there 's no more tension , no more drama . We can just be . But do you really ... love her ? Hey . What are you doing out here ? Well , I ... thought I saw a deer . Too bad you didn 't shoot it . Could have had it for lunch . Come on . Junior , let me up . You 're not leaving until Christine says so . You 're not yourself , Junior . You were infected . But you and I can fight this ... we 're family . My family is the problem . Crazy mother , narcissistic father , drunk uncle . I 'm part of the kinship now . For the first time , I have a real family . Restrain his arm . What are you doing to me ? Thank you , James , I can take it from here . Barbie could use another strong pair of hands back at the crater . This is all for your own good , Sam . Good boy . Good boy . You 're not like the rest of those cocoon whack-jobs , are you ? I was for a while until ... Till what ? You fell off a roof and decided to have feelings about it ? Nothing like breaking your spine to remind you of the most traumatic experience of your life . Short version : my mom died in front of me . Slowly and in agony . My pain reminded me of that day . Also made me remember who I am . Be skeptical if you want , but I know she brought me back . Hi , fellas . Took your time , though , didn 't you , sweetheart ? My boss needed some convincing , but he agreed to your plan to free Dr. Marston . Care package is on the way . Pleasure doing business with you , buttercup . Hey , Julia , I 'm on my way into town . Did you find out anything useful ? Yeah , the world 's still out there . Yeah , I picked up on that . Any idea what that was all about ? Christine did it . As soon as the sky turned back to blue , she came out of the tunnels , alive and well . Now she 's got the town mining those amethysts . Joe and Norrie are trying to figure out why . Who cares why ? Meet me at the high school . I know how to deal with this . Anything happens to my dog , I 'm gonna break your arms and throw you in the lake . There 's not much gas left . If we charge the battery , we can make it last longer . Watch out . Keep your eyes open . I think Christine , she may have sent some people back here . Come on , we got this . We sneak in , we get the schematic , and we get out . - Here . Desk . - All right . Joe , come here . I think I found something . That 's got to be it . It 's like Stonehenge , except squiggly . All right , let 's get out of here . Hey , Julia , we 've got the schematic . Copy that . Look , there 's my mom . What are you doing ? Julia needs this . If we get my mom alone , we can convert her . We want her on our side . What is that ? Turns out Aktaion 's actually good for something . After the dome cleared , Hunter reestablished contact with them , and then I negotiated , and they , sent this up to the lake . What did they want in exchange for all these explosives ? They want us to , free Dr. Marston from his kinship kidnappers . And , in case anyone asks , I did not slit that little weasel 's throat . At least we have what we need to , take care of Christine 's mining operation . You want to use it all at once , or you want to save some for a rainy day ? Nothing good came out of those tunnels . We use it all at once . We 're not gonna let Christine rise from the grave again . You know , if this plan works some people are gonna die . This is war . Up , up . Keep going , keep going . We got this . Almost there . All right , place it down . So ... you and Eva ? Come on , Junior . I 'm a gentleman . Do I have a sign on my back ? No , I 'm not trying to pry , I just think you guys are meant for each other . And that 's what it 's all about , right ? Yep , that 's it . Eleanor , where have you two been ? Remember my first day of second grade ? When I took a red marker to my face and I pretended I had chicken pox ? Eleanor , you need to come with me . No , no , listen to me . Both of you knew I was lying . But you still took care of me because you knew that I was scared and that I needed my moms . And now I need you again . I know you have emotions . I know it . Show me . You 're wasting valuable time . The kinship needs our help . Norrie , this is not working . Nope . Change of plans . It was your fault that Mom died . If you hadn 't forced me to go to that stupid reform school , then we wouldn 't have even been here in the first place . But she was always the one that I thought of as my real mom anyway . She gave birth to me . We had a stronger connection . And we didn 't tell you , but we both talked about it all the time . Norrie ... That time I slept over at Michelle Caldwell 's house , we actually went to an all-night rave in Long Beach . We hitchhiked . Norrie , this is not working . I did drugs . Mom , Joe and I are having sex . Say something , Mom ! Say something . Take them to the tunnels and put them to work . - Get off me ! - Get off ! Get off me ! Mom , please ! - Let go ! - Mom ! Mom ! Please stop . You 've taken too much of my blood already . It 's time to give some back . You 're transfusing me ? If you give me the wrong blood type , it 'll kill me . I 'm Type O. Universal donor . That 's your blood ? It 's a gift . I 'm giving you what you need to return to us . I 'll never be a part of the kinship . The life force is already inside you . This is just a boost . You 'll feel much better when you stop fighting it . I 'm seriously gonna get black lung . Keep your eyes open , Norrie . We 'll find a way to escape . All right , listen up ! Eva has set up a food station . After you eat , we 'll finish up with these amethysts . Not you two . Well , what about lunch ? You can miss one meal . These amethysts are necessary for our survival . All right . Up ! You can start bringing it over . All right , let it down . They 've already got one of them out of the tunnels . All right , everybody take a break ; Go get you some lunch . We 'll come back to this afterwards . Looks like they 're clearing out for chow time . This is our chance . Will you guys do me a favor and hang here ? Keep an eye on these tunnels , make sure no one heads down there ? Only three guards . We can handle that . If I draw them away , you think you can plant the explosives and get out in time ? Yeah , not a problem . There 's no turning back after this , Red . If we do this , they 're gonna hit us back hard . I 'm ready . Yeah , could be Barbie leading the charge . I 'm not dying 'cause you can 't pull the trigger on your boyfriend . Maybe it never comes to that . Yeah , well , if it does , you 'd better not hesitate . - ' Cause I won 't . - I get it , Jim . When the job 's done , we 'll meet back at the dock . Good luck . Please , no more . We can stop the transfusion , but first tell me , does your old life ... your human life ... actually have value ? I help people . Who have you really helped ? Have you saved anyone ? Your sister Pauline ? Angie McAlister ? And poor , lost Abby Dewitt ... where is she now ? You even tried to kill me , Sam . And all I ever wanted to do was to help you . All you have to show for your time on Earth is the shame of your human failings . Stop struggling , and all your shame will disappear . You 'd be welcomed . You 'd finally have value . It 's time to let go of your pain . I forgive you . The choice is yours , Sam . I hope you make the right one . All right , one down . What is that ... fire ? Look , the guard ! There 's no pulse . Where are the other two guards ? The smoke was a diversion . Yeah , I saw Julia in the woods this morning . She was planning something the whole time . The amethysts . We only have one . Okay . All right . Stay up here . Make sure no one comes down after me . What are you doing here ? You killed that guard , didn 't you ? That guard 's the least of your worries . I rigged those tunnels with enough explosives to blow us both to kingdom come . We got to clear out of here . Let 's go . If you don 't tell me where the bombs are , you 'll die right here . Listen . Not long ago , you wanted an apology from me , and I never gave it to you . I failed you , son . Don 't call me that . I 'm not your son anymore . You know , I ... I said that to my father once when I was your age . I tried so hard not to become him , but I just kept the cycle going . Pushed all that hurt onto you . I never let you be your own man . I am so ... sorry ... James . I am my own man now . I moved on when I burned your house down . So , if you 're done crying like a little girl , show me where the bombs are . Fine . Just follow me . Hunter ? Have Joe and Norrie help you pack anything useful from the house . We 're gonna need to clear out . Joe and Norrie aren 't back yet . I haven 't heard from them in a while . Okay , I 'll go look for them . Do what you can in the meantime . You shouldn 't be here . This is what it 's come to ? We gonna gun each other down in the street ? I 'm guessing you 're not a very good shot . But either way , you lose . Oh , yeah , how 's that ? You 're too late . Dale and I are bonded now . If you kill me , the man you love will never forgive you . What do you know about love ? Are you even capable of feeling it ? Love is a human construct . It has no value for the kinship . I truly am sorry . People like you and Jim Rennie ... you 'll be left behind . Dale and I , we 're the future . What you have is built on a lie . What Barbie and I have is real . I don 't have to kill you . Everybody get out ! There 's bombs in the tunnel ! Everybody , come on ! Get out ! Let 's go ! Clear out the tunnel ! - What 's that yelling ? - Let 's go ! Come on , get out of here ! Everybody , get out ! Drop everything ! Go , go , go ! Everybody out ! There 's bombs in the tunnel ! Everybody out ! When Barbie finally breaks free of this , he 's gonna choose me . It 's why I 'll keep fighting for him . It 's why I 'll win . Come on ! Let 's go ! Norrie ! Stop ! Norrie ? - Norrie , where are you ? - I 'm here . You saved me from that blast . You 're my daughter . Mom ... You 're back . Help me ! Get this off of her . What happened to me ? - I 'm so sorry . - I can 't move them . No , I should be the one apologizing . All those things that I said ... I didn 't mean them . I was just trying to snap you out of it , and ... I was lying . Norrie , we have to hurry . These tunnels are gonna collapse . You have to get out of here . No , Mom , I 'm not leaving you . There 's no time . You have to go . Now . I said no ! That 's my girl . Such a fighter . Keep her safe , Joe , - keep her safe ! - I will . I will , I promise . I love you so much , Mom . I love you , too , baby girl . Go , Joe ! No , no . - Go , Joe ! - Mom , please don 't leave me ! - Go ! - We have to go right now . - No ... - We have to go now ! Come on . Easy , Annie Oakley . What happened ? Are you bleeding ? No , that was somebody else . Look , as much as I 'd like to stick around and watch the people of Whoville cry about their precious tunnels going boom , we gotta get back to Bird Island . Not yet . Joe and Norrie are missing . Barbie . You okay ? There were bombs . Lots of bombs . Big Jim did this . Of course he did . Help ! Somebody ! Who is that ? Down here ! Come here . Is there anybody else down there ? My mom . Come on , Norrie . It 's not safe . Let 's go . You can 't call yourself " the new Hunter . " The old Hunter is still here , thank you very much . I didn 't come up with the name . They gave me your workstation and people started calling me that on their own . Wait , wait , did they swap out my PC ? Nope . And by the way , it took me no time at all to find all your " hidden " files . There was a disturbing amount of hentai in there . Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no . I-It was there to hide my actual secret files . Sure . Seriously . No , no , no . The file labeled " Tentacles " has my password-cracking algorithm in it . Is there any way you could send it to me ? I 've been busting my ass trying to rewrite it from memory . Hiding secrets in the porn . I 'm almost impressed . Sending the algorithm now . What 's going on ? They 're here . I need you to hold on to some files for safekeeping . I gotta wipe this drive . " They " ? Who 's " they " ? Gotta go . Good luck , Hunter May . Wait ! Lily ! Stop , Joe , I can 't go anymore . Norrie ... When I came here I had two moms that loved me . And now I have no one . What ? No . You have me here , Norrie . And I love you . Well , that 's just great . What ? N ... Norrie , we have to go . Where ? We 're under a freaking dome . Now ! Get in ! Let 's go , come on ! I stashed the car at Sam 's cabin . Still no sign of him . We should keep looking , though . He could be an ally . There are no allies left in Chester 's Mill . Those people may be infected , but they 're not lost . I 'm not giving up on Barbie . Well , you should . Poured my damn heart out to Junior . It 's useless . Emotion doesn 't work . It does work . I got through to my mom . For a moment , she was herself again . Why only a moment ? Because she 's dead . She was trapped . She made us leave her behind . We barely got out before the tunnels collapsed . My mom sacrificed herself so that her child could live , and there 's nothing more human than that . You set off those bombs , didn 't you ? You had no idea what was down there . What were you thinking ? There 's no regrets in war , Red . Here 's your schematic . These amethysts were essential . We 'll find a way to push on . Has Sam come back to us ? Depends how much fight is left in him . But if you provide people with the right lie , they 'll believe what they want to . For this town , it was an image of the end of the world . With Sam , all it took was a pint of his own blood . See ? Not a scratch . And my forgiveness . That 's the only one left . How did this happen ? - Blame Big Jim . - And Julia . Thank God I had a gun . Otherwise she would have killed me . She tried to hurt you ? I found her fleeing from the crater . She started shooting at me , so I fired a shot in the air so she 'd take cover and then I ran . I barely got away . She 's obsessed with you , Dale . She 's not going to stop . This is my fault . I saw Julia this morning . I ... she-she told me that she was just here to talk , and I believed her . She didn 't care if I died in those caves . I could have stopped her , and I didn 't . The actions of this resistance have threatened our very survival . The time has passed for peaceful coexistence . We need to strike back . We need to kill them all .

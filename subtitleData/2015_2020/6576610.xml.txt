 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha . - There 's a new strain of super flu sweeping through the northeast . - I think it 's some type of virus or something . Anybody has any information ... - The government is advising everyone to be aware of the symptoms including sore throat , coughing up blood , and vertigo . - What am I supposed to do ? - ... when everyone around me is just dying ? I don 't know how to get out of it . - We urge people to stay indoors and avoid human contact . - People are dying straight ... leaders ... - Top scientists are working together on a cutting edge delivery method for the cure . - Right on schedule . You gotta admire their work ethic . When the virus hit , everyone was just focused on survival . Everything needed to be shut down , but nobody really told the drones . My friends call me Kitch . Well , they called me Kitch . The drones were still useful . Just not in the way they were intended . Once upon a time they were cutting-edge technology , Now they 're kind of like wildlife . Hunted and stripped for their components . Especially these . Arcanum pellets . No one uses money anymore . This is the only thing anyone cares about . Well , almost everyone . Deep down , I think all us survivors have one thing in common . We just want to feel normal again . - I didn 't know you were coming back yet ... you weren 't gonna come back ... You found one , didn 't you ? Let me look , let me look . - Let me see my camera first . - Uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh ... That 's not how I do business . You let me see that first , if I like what I see , then I 'll let you see , then I 'll let you see the camera . Atta kid . Alright . Give me one second . I 'll be right with you . Feel free to look around while you 're here . Here ... and we 're right at ... 19 % , what are you trying to pull ? - It 's like 19.9 , okay ? - 19 point ... no , no , no ... it 's 19 % . We agreed on 20 . You come back here with 19 . - I tried what I could , okay ? - It 's ... it 's so close to 20 % , it ... you 're only doing this just to make me pay for my own camera back . - Your own camera ? - It 's got my sticker on it . - It 's my camera . You know how I know its sticker ? I found that camera . That 's how I know it 's my camera . - So everything you find is just yours ? - Right , where 'd you find that bag ? Eh ... I gotcha , huh ? See ? So You think you can outsmart me ? It doesn 't work that way . - So if I find this ball , huh ? - Put that back . Look , we had an arrangement of 20 % for the camera , this is 19 % . 20 % for the camera , no 20 % no camera . Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa ... come back , come back . Let 's not ... let 's not be too hasty here , okay ? It 's not about the percent , it 's not about one percent , it 's about principle . You know ? It 's about attitude . It 's about business . You have a business agreement , you got to honor that business agreement . Right ? Right ? Yeah . Alright , alright , he 's what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna put it down somewhere , I 'm gonna ... give it back to you , but ... uh ... . you 're gonna have to owe me one , alright ? Just a little ... a little bit of interest in that . For sure . But you 'll give me back , right ? Alright . Get out of here . - You know ... We haven 't had much alone time lately . That 's because I don 't want to be alone with you . Please , no ! - Hey 4C . So yeah , I got those ... uh ... I got those arc pellets you 're wanting ... . uh ... about 60 % total . It 's about 20 % average each and ... uh ... . I even shined them pretty good for you , so ... uh , you know ... . Uh ... you gotta ... I know you don 't like to get your hands dirty ... . It 's all ... all here , all three and ... and just like I said , a day early even . - I said ... uh ... nothing under twenty . - Right . So you know that kid uh ... by the river ... came up with 19 % this morning and instead he owes me twenty ... So I smacked him around real good . Uh ... you know ... He 's gonna give me another 5 % by the end of the week , and ... uh ... yeah , yeah ... - First of all , we don 't hit kids without my permission . Second of all , This ... can never ... happen again . Are we clear ? Get outta here . - When I was a kid , I used to pretend my dad was a superhero . Every day , as soon as he 'd leave the house , he 'd rip off his suit and tie and fly off on amazing adventures to save the world . Now I just pretend he 's still alive . It 's strange , I ... I thought I had seen every single kind of drone imaginable . I mean , you 've got survey drones that would take pictures and make maps , there were high-altitude drones that replaced weather balloons , there were even these carrier drones that they used to rush samples and other things to the hospital . But , even with all those different purposes , all of them were very similar . But this one ? This one 's ... different . - Oh , Red ... Before the Fringer kid gets it . - Hey , hand it over . - Hand what over ? - The drone ! Come on ! - This ? - Yes ! Please , give it to me ! Come on ! - Hey , that 's mine ! Okay ? - You let it get away ... - Maybe if you weren 't accusing me so much , you could have actually caught it . - Oh Red ! What 's going on ? I can 't be up here all day . Where is it ? - Coming ! - So your name 's Red ? - It 's Maya . I hate being called Red . - Sorry . I 'm Kitch . - Nobody asked . Come on , what do you got ? - What do you want me to do ? I don 't owe you ... - I ... your pocket watch ! - Hey ! Hey ! - Where 's the drone ? - Uh ... the ... the Fringer kid has it . - It sounds like you just had the Fringer kid have my drone . - I ... I have a watch . - Oh , great . That 's ... that 's a watch . I told you to hurry up . - I could get ... I couldn 't get it , I 'm sorry . - Are you ... you 're kidding me , right ? There 's a drone back there somewhere . - Okay , well , why don 't you just go down and get it yourself ? It 's still down there . - I 'm gonna chase until they fringe you to the Fringes ? How do you expect me to protect you ? Red , these drones haven 't been flying around forever . I have three more boxes of shells . - Yeah , I 'll go find the Fringer kid . - Yeah , and don 't come back without an arc pellet ! Keep the frickin ' watch . Whoa , whoa ... hold ... It 's a half a mile away ; How am I supposed to get it with this ? Might as well throw rocks at them like the Fringes . - During the early days of the outbreak , the government sent them into the house . They said they needed my dad 's help . That 's when I knew that things were a lot more serious than the news was letting on . The worst things got , the less I saw of him . Then one day , he ... he never came home at all . Dad ? - That 's my stuff ! - How 's it goin ' , bud ? Heard you had a new arc pellet . - Who told you that , Hashtag ? Well , he 's a liar ! - Are you gonna tell me where it is or do I need to break something ? - Get off of me ! - Got it . Let 's see what we got here . 14 % ! - 4C 's gonna be pissed ! We gotta find something . - I think I know where we can go . - I have to believe that Dad is still alive out there . Somewhere . And that he 's looking for me . Because if he 's not , then , what 's the point of any of this ? What did you do ? Everything I had was in there . - I ... I 'm sorry ... - So my watch wasn 't enough ? You had to take everything ? - Come on , we don 't have enough time . - Hey , where are you going ? - It 's down , come on ! - What happened ? Give me that . - Come on . Get down . Get down ! - What the heck is this ? What 's going on ? - What are we gonna do now ? - Hey , hey ... It 's okay . It 's alright . Spread out , find him , scatter hunt ... - They want you . - Wait ... Power cell . We need to go ... Thank you . - So what 's so special about the drone ? - It 's the only way I 'm gonna be able to find my dad . I know there 's not a lot of people around , but can 't you find someone else 's life to ruin ? - I 'm sorry , I was just trying to turn on the lights ! - Yeah , okay , thanks . Thanks for trying not to destroy everything I own . - Well , I mean , at least I saved your Doctor 1 ! What ? - It 's DR-1 . There 's not even a period . - Doctor One sounds better . - No it doesn 't . - Yeah it does . How long have you been on your own ? - A while . I don 't really mind being alone too much , though . - Don 't you miss your dad ? - Yeah . - Why didn 't you try to find him before ? - I couldn 't , really . I didn 't ... even really know that he was alive until I found this . - Yeah . - But ... even with ... DR-1 here , it 's ... it 's gonna be tough . - You can find him . I 'll help you . I 'm coming with you . Hey ... um ... I have your watch . - Oh . Hey , why 'd you take it ? - Uh , how about I ... give it back to you if I don 't have to explain ? - Thank you . - It 's your dad 's ? - Yeah . Are either of your parents still around ? - No . - I 'm sorry . - So how 's DR-1 ? - Should be good to go . Let 's see . - Alright , we need ... um ... sleeping bags and tents . Pronto . - Yeah , we need ... - What do you need ? - You know , the shipment . Come on , don 't you listen at the meetings ? We 're going up north , getting 4C 's shipment . Come on . Let 's go . - Yeah , alright , no problem . - Let 's go ! Don 't have all day ! - I got a shelter house . Uh ... You can ... yeah , what do you need to rent for ? - Alright . Sleeping bags , tent ... - Yeah , what is ... what 's with the ... Hey , is he working for the boss now ? - Yeah . - What do you do ? - He 's like a professional drone expert . You didn 't know that ? - Yeah . Right ... - Hence the drone . - Alright , okay . - Get it together . Hey , look , I wanna give 4C a good report , - Remember I brought you the camera back , man ... how 's that working out for you ? Still have it ? - It 's fine , okay ? Take the toilet paper . Thank you . We 're good . - Alright ... You still owe me ... uh ... 3 % . - Thank you ! - First of all , we 're low on 20 % s ... I 'm now open to 15 % arcs . Get ' em to me , Second of all , we 're firing up that diesel next week . We 're Moving all those spools of aluminum wire . Get over it . Red didn 't come home last night , Check the Fringes ... get it ... Hold on , Hashtag . Most importantly this long haired Fringer stole a drone ... hold on , Hashtag . Stole a drone from me . Right underneath my nose . - Hey boss ? Didn 't you send Maya on a camping trip ? What are you talking about ? She stopped by with that long-haired Fringer ... - Whoa , are you telling me Red ran off with that Fringer kid ? - No , they ... - She wouldn 't do that . AJ , go get the weapons . Get on the road , probably head North ... - It 's all clear . My parents were some of the first to go . I always hope they take me , too . I was immune , so ... lucky me ended up with my uncle . - Hey . - What are you doing ? - Hey ! - They 're stealing our stuff ! - Wait ! - Great , now we have no supplies ... Dirty Fringers ! - Hey , welcome to my mall ! 10 % park , get you everything you can carry . - When the whole world has turned upside down , it 's strange when you start to miss the things you never really appreciated until they were gone . Fast food , films , air-conditioning ; We came so far just to have it all yanked away . Being all alone during the outbreak was hard , but I accepted it , because deep down , I thought my dad was dead . And now that there 's a chance that he might still be alive , I can 't stop wondering : Did he think I wasn 't tough enough ? Did he not care ? I miss my dad more than anything . But I 'm afraid what I must learn when I find him . You were once heading east , which is the direction I penciled off , so I think that 's where we 'll go . - How far is that ? - It 's ... usually a couple hours by car , if that 's even working now . - Hey ... Hey ! I said what you can carry . Not what carries you . Leave the bikes . No , no , no . Leave the bike . - What a prick ! - Seriously ? Hey , back at the house , why didn 't you go after the Fringer kids ? Totally could have gotten them . - It 's ... it 's best not to get involved . Where 's it going ? Wait ! Wait ! Why 'd you do that ? You shot him ! - No , I didn 't . He shot me . - What are you talking about ? It 's all over the sky , it 's . - It has a built in ENP , it protects itself when it feels danger . How do you know so much about this ? This is ... - I built it . It 's the DR-1 prototype . I worked for sky medics for fifteen years . - Do you know my dad ? - Who 's your dad ? - Mitchell Scott . - You 're Kitch ? - Yeah ... - Oh yeah , he 's the one that brought me over here to work on the drone project , from Sweden . - Where is he now ? Do you know where he is ? - I haven 't seen him in years . - You built it , then you need to fix it . - Relax ! - Hey ! Wait ! You need to fix this ! - It 's gonna need to reboot . It 's gonna do fine ! Welcome to my camp , for ... the night . You 're welcome to make yourself at home . I 'm ... I 'm David , by the way . - Maya . - Wait a second . There 's only 52 % left . - Ah , it 's probably on type two arc pellet now . - There was 84 % before , how 'd it get that low ? - In the ENP blast . Hey , put him down before he initializes . You know it 's gonna be all wonky . - Where 's he going ? - To do a perimeter check . - Alright , so it 's ... um ... gonna get cold fast . We should probably get some firewood . - He 'll come back , right ? - Yeah , it 's gonna check the perimeter , and make sure it 's safe . - Alright , I 'm going now ! - Thanks , that 's very kind . Then he 's gonna come back and report . - Report ? How ? - Yeah , he ... uses Morse code . - Morse code . Should have thought of that . Do you know More code ? - Yeah , I can ... write it down for you . I 'm surprised you don 't know it . Your father should have taught you . - He usually didn 't have much time . - Yeah , I can see that . - So what was it like , working with my dad ? - The military ... wanted to ... place some order of a thousand DR 1s , but you father refused . Turned them down . Most people would kill for a contract like that , but your father was different . He knew DR-1 had a higher purpose . We respect him for that . So give a minute . So ... uh ... how long have you been together with Maya ? - Since she saved DR-1 . - From what ? - From my place burning down . - Ah , how did that happen ? - I guess the type 2 arc pellets don 't work too well with a standard converter . - You put a type 2 arc pellet in the standard converter ? I 'm surprised it didn 't blow up . - Oh , it kind of did . - So , besides burning down your place , what do you know about her ? - She did save DR-1 . She gave me my watch back . - Your watch back from what ? - She stole it . - You really think you can trust her ? - Here . I ... saved these for a special occasion . You want one ? - So , were you with my dad during the outbreak ? - No . - Oh . - I got sick a year before the outbreak . It was cancer and ... my wife stood by me . She was the only reason I wanted to live . But because I was sick , the drone project had a lot of setbacks and ... they really needed my help , but ... I couldn 't . When the outbreak hit , we weren 't prepared . I got better , but my wife never got the vaccine . The drone never came . It 's ironic how I survived because of her and she died because of me . A lot of people blame your father , but it was really my fault . I hope you find your dad . I really do . Tell him I 'm sorry . - What are you doing ? - I think I 'm making progress . - We should get going . - As soon as my guys get back here with my niece , we 'll work wicked hard , we 'll have that grid up in a week and a half . Tango 4 Charlie , out . Hashtag ? - Need help ? - I need you to go to the drone races . Place the bet for me . - I thought you said that was too risky , We weren 't gonna do that anymore . - I know what I said . It 's one last bet . Put it all on ... - Are you sure ? The odds on him are like 50 to one . - I 've been assured he wins . - Okay . - I need you to be careful . It 's everything we have . - Yeah . - Don 't let me down . - You got it , 4C . - This doesn 't make any sense ; There 's no rule for space and ... I 'll figure it out later . - So , Mitchell Scott is your dad ? - Yeah . - And you never thought to mention it ? - You never asked . - So we 're looking for the man who is responsible for the death of so many people . - He didn 't kill anyone . The virus did . You know that . He gave up everything just to help people . Even me . Just for everyone else . - But how do you know that 's why ? I mean , you didn 't even know he 's alive until DR-1 showed up . - I knew my father , okay ? He always did both , right ? If you 're just gonna sit there and blame him like everyone else and I don 't need you . - Wait . The ... the world is just so dark . And the hope I see in you inspires me . It 's why I came . And I don 't want our time to be angry . I just thought that ... if finding your dad ... I don 't know . I just taught that maybe finding your dad would ... make me feel like I had a family , too . - Listen ... he 's not who they say he is . You 're just gonna have to trust me . Let 's go . Looks like there 's a camp out back . - Do you think they have food ? - I don 't know . We should probably go around them . - It 's worth a try . Right ? Aren 't you hungry ? - What 's with DR-1 ? - I don 't know . Go pick him up . - You kids ... uh ... You kids need some help ? - Just passing through , really . - We could ... . uh ... use some food . - Well , we have food . We have a lot of ... drone racers pass through . - Drone racers ? - Uh-huh . We even have showers . Where 's your controller ? - It 's a ... - So , about those hot showers ... Sounds great , doesn 't it ? - I didn 't say they were hot . - Oh . - Well , you can take one . And we can give you food . Oh , everyone 's welcome here . Yeah , it 's been rough on us , too . But with each day and each week , each month , we keep getting stronger . And we 're starting to be able to supply ourselves . - That 's pretty good . Now , before you eat , we have a little radio setup to help families reconnect , and we 'd like to put your name on the list , okay ? - That 's okay . Thanks , though . - No , I 'm sorry . It 's a requirement . You see , we 're actually trying to put society back on track . We can 't have all these nameless people . So just think of it as you 're helping rebuild it . Good . It won 't take long . Why don 't you go ahead and sit down ? Go ahead . Please . Good . No , no , no . And you I need to talk to , so you can set that down . We 'll be back , don 't worry . Go ahead and sit . Yeah , all we need is name and a little bit of information , where you came from , how you got where you are , it won 't take long , then you can go and eat . I 'll just get it done . This is ... uh ... - Kitch . - No , your real name . - Mitchel . - We need to process Mitchell , and when you 're done with him , we have another one outside . You 're all about the same age . - Hey , Hey ! What ? Why do you have to take those ? - Because we have to see what 's inside . - Why ? - Well ... here we 're making a ... - What 's this ? - What does it say ? - Mitchell , huh ? I think we have a celebrity in our premises . - What 's it say ? - Bring in the girl ! - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Let me go ! - I 'm sorry . No one 's going anywhere until they tell me everything they know about Mitchel Scott . - I 'm not telling you anything . I 'm taking this drone back to my uncle . - Who might your uncle be ? - Hey , Maya . Rick , we need to talk . Now . - What 's going on ? - No . Should I ? - She happens to be the niece of my boss . Of course you do . We 're taking her with us . - Get out . - Let 's go , get your stuff . - Hey boss . We got Maya and the boy . Turns out they were following the drone to his father . Mitchel Scott . We 'll be back soon . - Keep this drone under control . - I 'm not paid enough for this . - If you guys need some arc , we can go to the drone races , like right here . I mean , this drone is super charged , it 's got an AI . And it follows him . Come is as the underdog , clear up , get a ton of arc . - Doesn 't 4C rig those ? - No , he put out of that a little while ago . You 're starting to catch on . - It 's settled then . Let 's get some more . Let it go . It 'll follow him . Let it go ! - Where 's that thing going ? Get it back here , now . - Enough ! Be right back . - Let 's get one thing clear . You 're gonna get your drone under control , you 're gonna win the race , and you 're gonna come back to 4C 's with us , - Figure out whose side you 're own , quick . - Pilot or speculator ? - Oh , he 's a pilot . He 'd like to register for the main event . - I 'm sorry . You have to be a pre-registered pilot for this event . Did you guys compete last week ? - Uh , no we didn 't , but ... - Wait , Kitch ? - Hannah ? - Hi ! - Hey . - You not mess this up . - Hi ! Can you help me out here ? - Yeah , of course . Anything . What do you need ? - ... submitted to ... be in the races . - Okay . Yeah , yeah , sure . - Alright . It looks like we have ourselves a new pilot . - Thanks . - And ... here . You 're gonna be able to teach DR-1 this course , right ? - He 's fast enough , but I can 't teach him this . I 'll have to control him manually . I don 't even have a controller . - I can get you a controller . You 're gonna be able to win this ? - Yeah . - They gave us 8 to 1 odds . - So we 'll be out on a little bit . - That 's good . Go get him a controller . - I need you to not mess this up . - What do you mean ? - He means ... You lose , you 're not leaving with the drone . - This work ? - Where 'd you get it ? Don 't worry about it . It 'll still work , right ? - Yeah . - Hey , boss ! I caught a drone . - Oh , you caught ... my ... messenger drone . Thanks . Go move some boxes . - I 've got an eye on the boy . Turns out they were following his father . Mitchell Scott . I 'll be back soon . - Kilo , Golf 1 , this is Tango-4-Charlie , over . My guys have found Papa Bravo , minor . He was following a drone . Heading to Papa , Bravo , major . Over . Confirm . Papa Bravo , minor . Over . Tango 4 Charlie Alpha . - He 's a little rough . Is steering gonna work ? - It 'll be fine . I just need to dial in the expo and reverse the router . DAI takes over and I let go of the sticks . It 'll be fine . - I believe in you . No matter what you say , I believe in you . - Enough . If you believe in me , then why are they here ? You weren 't even surprised when they showed up ! - I know what it looks like , but you have ti trust me . You know what it looks like ? It looks like I can 't trust anyone . - You have to believe me , okay ? - All this time you 've been running away from your uncle now you 're heading back to him . - I know what it looks like . I 'm gonna get us out of it . Okay ? You 'll see . - I need to focus on getting ready for the race . Leave me alone . - Just please , trust me . Please . - Final bets are in . All bets are final . Final bets are in ... - They got all eyes on you , so just focus on me , okay ? - Okay . - Yeah ! - Let 's do it . - Watch this turn , it 's tight . - Down , up , nice . - Little one , pick up speed . Quick . - Watch out . Someone 's passing under you . Go , now ! Still got to pass three more to get in the lead . - Come on ! Ha ha ha ha ha ! - Alright , first lap . You 're doing good , okay ? - I think I can do this . - 3rd racer down . - That 's our dude ! That 's our dude ! - What are you doing ? - I can 't see . - I thought we had unfogged those . - Indistinct- - Hold on , that 's Kitch ! - He set his transmitter down . - ... pace , go ! Indistinct - - I knew he was gonna mess this up . - Indistinct- ... of this race . - Only two more . - You got this . Watch out , one of them is gaining on you . - I can gain some ground on them straight away . - We have ourselves a winner . - Yes ! Did you see that ? - Hey kid , Hey , you know what we do to cheaters , man ? - Yeah I was ... what are you talking about ? - Yeah , right . I don 't believe that . Prove it . - It has an AI , but it can 't . - Hey . - So use the AI . - Hey ! He didn 't cheat ! - What 's she talking about ? - He was flying , he won fair and square . - Yeah , okay , okay . You can 't ... - I 've been flying my whole life . - So what ? - You can teach an AI to fly . If you want to go after someone , go after them . They 're the big winners here . They kidnapped us , they forced us to race and they won all the arc . - I thought these guys looked familiar . I think they are those two thugs who used to work for 4C , You all better hope this checks out . - Are you coming ? - Just trying to make sense of all this . - Hey , was that ... ? - Yeah . - I 've never seen nobody fly like that , pretty good . Well , I just want to thank the guys before I catch my bus to Pittsburgh . - What ? - Bus to Pittsburgh ? What are you talking about ? - See the rumor is the Grid back up in Pittsburgh . And thanks to you guys , I got enough arc to catch my bus tomorrow . Somebody snatched the bag out of the thug 's hands the arc went everywhere . - What about a bus ? How does it work ? - Somebody snagged a very good run off of cooking oil . Now they 're taking people back and forth for ten percent each . - Is there any way you can get us on the bus ? - I sure can ! For about 20 percent ! - This is worth 20 percent . - Yeah ... this could work . - Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if the outbreak never happened . I 'd be a Junior in high school , I 'd probably have my driver 's license , I 'd be planning for college , and I would have all the latest video games . But is all of that even important ? What kind of person would I be ? Would I be the man dad wanted me to be ? Would I be someone 's proud of ? I try so hard to do the right thing , but maybe all of this has nothing to do with it . Maybe life would just be different if Dad were here . Maybe I 'd ... maybe I 'd just be me . - Alright , let 's get these guys going , alright ? Hey , get comfy , grab a nap , You guys leave around midnight , so , uh , seriously , get comfy . - They 're gonna blame my uncle for what happened back there . Should have thought of a better plan . - But I thought you hated your uncle . - I hate living with him , but I don 't hate him . He used to babysit me when my parents would travel , so I sort of spent more time with him than with my real dad . He 's a different person now . Look , I 'm really sorry , Kitch . I 'm sorry about the watch , and your hideout , and everything else . - You don 't have to apologize . We wouldn 't even made it this far without him . It 'd still be in my head , planning instead of doing . Besides , I ... . ended up having to get rid of my dad 's watch anyway . - Either way , I 'm really sorry . - Don 't worry about it . - Thanks . ♫ Nothing in this world for me , ♪ ♫ Walked away and left me . ♪ ♫ Um , um , um ... . ♪ ♫ You said you 'd never leave , ♪ ♫ my heartfelt memory ♪ ♫ Walking in this wasteland , , ♪ ♫ you 're so far from me , ♪ ♫ so far ... ♪ ♫ Everything 's a wasteland , ♪ ♫ I 'll never be free . ♪ ♫ I miss you more than ever ♪ ♫ heart is surely severed . , ♪ ♫ Ooh , ooh , ooh ... ♪ ♫ How can I go on , ♪ ♫ without you by me ? ♪ ♫ You 're so far from me , , ♪ ♫ so far ... ♪ ♫ Everything 's a wasteland , ♪ ♫ I 'll never be free . ♪ ♫ Be free ... ♪ ♫ Be free . ♪ - I heard we 're passing by the Sky Medix facility . - I thought it got burned down . - I don 't know .

I knew this bus wasn 't gonna make it all the way . This gonna be a long walk . - Man , you need to do something to fix it . - We can try . - We gotta hurry up and go . - Okay . - I accidentally set off his EMP while I was practicing Morse code . - Of course . - It took me up 21 percent . We should fire something to blasts . - Indistinct- . - Hey ! Sorry about the mess up here . Before y 'all to get out of here , you got to get this back . I can 't keep this from you . You kids be safe . - Thank you so much . - Alright ? - You too . - Hannah , take a look . - What is he doing ? - It looks like he 's hiding . - From what ? - I think it 's a stick . - What are you doing ? - He 's going the wrong way . Alpha 's this way . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . - Don 't you think we should follow him ? - He 's probably just taking a shortcut or something . Let 's just go the way I know ; He 'll follow it . - Is this it ? - Yeah . I 've been here before , but not since the outbreak . - So , how 's the soup ? - Kinda cold . - I 'm sorry . What did you want with these kids , anyway ? - Well , I mean , I don 't really need the boy , I 'm just trying to get Maya back for my boss . - And what do I get out of this ? - Um ... I mean , it 's really important , so , what can I do for you ? - Let me ask you something . - Okay . - What if there was a way for you to get what you want and help build a stronger generation ? - Okay , sure . - No , listen . Before the outbreak , the weak thrived . And then the virus hit and the weak were rooted out . Humanity became stronger , and I will not let , I will not allow . Sky Medix to spoil this opportunity . - There 's nobody here . I have to check something . - This is Dr. Mitchel Scott . Clinical trial 184 subject 183 . - He 's still looking for a cure . - All shown unsuccessful . Subject 185 . First day of infection . About to administer a pediatric dose of Hydrochlorothiazide in the left thigh . Subject has been exhibiting some edema in the lower extremities , specifically the ankles , cyanotic around the lips , and the toes . Now we wait . Patient 185 died this morning at 2 : 15 , respiratory distress . Another subject 's coming in today , possibly with a well attempt of dose ... of medication . - No ! No ! - Kitch ! - Quit following me ! I said go away ! - Hey ! He 's just doing what he 's told ! Kitch ! What is your problem ? - What is my problem ? All of this is been for nothing . - What do you mean nothing ? - Look at this place . Okay ... there 's no one here . And even if my father was here , you saw the video , he 's the monster everyone 's saying he is . - So what are you saying ? You should just give up ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know what to do ! - When you start feeling something , you just shut it all out . You just wanna walk away when there 's a problem , but we 've come so far that you can 't give up now ! But you wanna walk away ? Fine . I don 't care . That 's ... that 's what cowards do . And that 's what you always do . Back at the house , we could have stopped those Fringers , but what did you do ? Nothing . You just live in this world where you think you can shelter yourself from anything that 's real . But let me tell you something , Kitch , you 're not the only one who 's had to sacrifice . And you 're not the only one who 's had to give things up and I left my uncle , my job , to follow some coward out in the middle of nowhere . You want to go run and hide and shelter yourself in your hole again , go ahead . Be my guest . Because if you think that this was all for nothing , you think that we were all for nothing , then I think you should go . - Fine . - Let 's go . - 4C . - Yeah , I 'm back here . Where 's Maya ? - I don 't ... I don 't know ... She took of with the kid . What happened ? Her and the kid ran off after we won the drone races . - What do you mean you won the drone races ? - We went and took the kid and we put his drone in and he won and we 're gonna make a bunch of arc off it . So you got arc ? We won the race but then the crowd turned on us and then me and AJ got separated . I don 't know what happened after . - Where 's Hashtag ? - Hashtag ? - Hashtag had all my arc . He was supposed to put on bank and yank to win . - What do you mean your arc ? You ... you were betting on the races ? I thought you were done with the races . - Oh , you screwed up . - You give me the truck , I 'll go find them . They were headed east ... I think they were , maybe northeast ... - I know where they 're headed . Alright ? But I can 't just give you the truck . Was she ... did she seem alright the last time you saw her ? - I ... I don 't know . Alright ? The crowd was coming down on us , I don 't know what happened to her after that . She ... she took off . - Jesus Christ ... We 'll get you on the road . Damn it ! - Look ! Is that it ? - That must be the virology lab . It makes sense if DR-1 is still in there somewhere . If my dad is still working anywhere , that 'd be it . - He 's gotta be there . What is that ? It looks like my uncle 's truck . - What 's it doing out here ? - I don 't know . Seriously , I don 't know . - Well , what should we do ? - What are you doing ? - I 'm taking you home . - Home ? - Let 's go ! Get in the truck . - I 'm not going home . - Yeah , you are ! No I 'm not . I didn 't drive all the way out here to not bring you . Go with the truck . - She doesn 't want to go back . What 's your problem ? - I don 't care what she wants . She 's a kid . Her opinion doesn 't matter . Just go get in the truck . - Excuse me ? Does my uncle know that you have his truck ? - Look , don 't worry about that . Just go get in the truck . I 'm taking you back . - I 'm not going with you . - Look , go get in the truck . - Whoa , what are you doing with that ? - I 'm calling your uncle . - No , put the gun down ! - Get in the truck ! I 'm taking you back to your uncle ! How could you not figure it out yet ? Land the drone . - No ! - Land the drone . - Land the drone . - I 'm tired of these stupid drones everywhere I go ! Go get in the truck . - It 's fine , he 's not gonna hurt anyone anyways . - Go get in the truck ! - And what if I don 't ? - Why won 't anyone take me seriously ? I 've got a gun ! What 's it gonna take to get your attention ? - Hey , what are ... - No ! Why did you do that ? - Because nobody 's listening to me ! Are you insane ? This drone has caused all of these problems . - Are you insane ? - I 'm not getting in that truck ! - There are bigger problems in this world that adults need to sort out kids need to go home . I 'll shoot him next . - Hey ! Hey ! - You want me to shoot him ? You want him dead ? Then I 'll shoot him next . - Fine , fine , I 'll go ! Fine . I 'll go . - You can 't go . You can 't go with him ! - You 're so close . You have to go , okay ? - Look at what he 's doing . - You 're so close . We didn 't come this far for nothing . I know where you are , okay ? Just go before he does something stupid ! I 'll think of something , okay ? Just go ! - Go ! Go ! You 're just bad luck ! - Hey , let go , let go ... No . Ow ! - You shot him ! - Ow ! - Oh my God ! Oh my Gosh ! Where is it ? - Why did you make me shoot you ? - Oh I don 't like you ! - Is anywhere else ... - Why did you make me shoot you ? Get the gun . - Do you think you can walk ? - Yeah , I think so . - It should help . I 'll get DR-1 . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . Almost there . - Maya ! Down ! Down ! Down ! Get down ! - Wait a second . - Get down ! - Hey ! Tell Mitchell Scott his son is here . - ... ah ! What is this ? Kitch ! No ! Go away ! Kitch , no ! Please ! Kitch ! - Kitch ? - Dad ? Where 's my android ? - They 're fine , they 're fine. uh ... You were off about twenty-four hours there , guy . We had to conduct some tests on you to make sure you were okay for our environment . You 've grown up so much . Now you 're a man . Look , um ... why don 't you finish getting dressed , get your boots on , and meet me in the hallway ? Okay . Kitch . - Hey are we all gonna ... ? It would even be better if my niece hadn 't run off with your son . - Maya doesn 't want anything to do with you . - Kitch , relax , you gotta trust me . Just give a second ... - Don 't listen to him ! - Kitch , just calm down . - What do you have to explain ? - Calm down ! - I 've been living in a hole in the ground and you 've been over here this whole time ! - It 's not black and white , Kitch , it 's not ... - Kitch . - It 's fine ! - Kitch ! - What are you doing ? Kitch , please . - Let 's just get out of here . - Why don 't you just give your dad a chance to explain ? - Explain what ? Maya , look at this place . It 's all true . Experimenting on babies ... my dad is choosing everything else over me . Now he 's in there hanging out with 4C ? I was just a lot happier playing video games and imagining he was some sort of hero . - Hey ... It 's been a rough few days . Why don 't we just go inside and talk about it ? You don 't trust anyone right now . Trust me . Okay ? Okay . Let 's go . - We recently discovered that an oxygen-rich environment helps infants survive most fatal stages of the infection . - Why not just use the vaccine that the drones have been dropping ? - We lost the vaccine just before the drones went online . The Board decided ... we decided to send out a placebo instead to minimize the panic . - What are you even doing here ? You 're supposed to be doing good things , not buying babies ... - We have sent devices ... - To test your own failures ! - to expected mothers to ... to give birth here . Or else the babies would die . Infants can 't contract the virus in the mother 's womb . They do contract the virus from their mother during the natural birth process . That 's why 4C 's been working so hard to get the power grid back up . We have to get new facilities running . - So ... so there 's no cure . - The vaccine was the was the best we could ever hope for . It was lost and we had no solution until today . - Today ? What 's so special about today ? - before the outbreak , we had a non lethal strain . We ... we knew it was coming . I had enough to inject a host to propagate the vaccine We ... we were ahead of the game . Unfortunately , a group of extremists attacked . They ... they believe the virus was a good thing . Taking out the weak . Thinning the herd . We lost it all , we lost everything . And I was forced into quarantine to continue looking for a solution . - So you lost the vaccine when we were separated ? - When we were separated , I lost my son . And the world lost a second chance . We tried so hard to find you . We had to find you . Kitch , it 's in your blood . - Dad , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean it , I was just I was scared ... - I understand . I love you so much . - I love you , Dad . When everything gets torn apart , that 's when you finally start to realize what really matters . I thought that if I 'd found my dad , everything would just fall into place . I would be safe and things would go back to being normal again . But ... is anything in life normal , or safe , or even simple ? It 's not just some game divided into heroes and villains , it 's not black and white or good versus evil . Life is just people . People trying to make the best out of what we 're given . Maybe all the chaos is meant to remind us of these people around us . People that are shinning brightly . Daring to hope when all seems lost . People that are lost and bump into others while finding their way . And people that bring out the best in us . If we 're brave enough to trust them . - So how 's it going ? It should be ... good to go . Just can 't get it to arm . - Hello , Kitch . - The world as we knew it may have ended , but that doesn 't mean we shouldn 't move forward and try to live our lives . Because for everyone who comes after us , this will be the only world they ever know .

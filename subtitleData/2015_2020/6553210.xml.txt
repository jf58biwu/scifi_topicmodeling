This will only work ... If you wear glasses , Maddie . The only way that will make sense is that we all see this together . But what about Riley ? I think we should stay . Why ? I ... I do not feel any danger here . It 's just the past . Past can not be repeated , right ? 's Right . But our feelings about the past are real . - You 're right , too . - Looking ... Our past on the big screen is a bit disturbing Right ? Especially when Many other people are seeing what Is happening in our ... in our head But ... we have to find out Why things began to change , and I think this is the key . Disturbing ? You want to talk about disruption ? Right ? That was my life ... And just one second all he changed . I think that 's the point . Riley ! She forgave me . She said I should let myself myself off the hook . I guess it was time . What now ? Good question . Seat , Riley . I do not think we 've seen still function . Glasses , Maddie . Ruédala , Deep !

I love how small and frail I feel under heaven . It 's as if time stopped here , you know ? You know , all vastness Space and time and I landed in this shithole . Great . Thank you . Although we know a lot about our universe , There are hundreds , thousands , Even millions of questions we can ask ourselves . Is there an end ... For the universe as it continues to expand ? Is it possible to travel planets light years away from the earth ? What about black holes ? Do wormholes ? Dark Matter ? Is it possible that could be ... Portals ... Somewhere else entirely ? The universe has been our greatest mystery . Our great unknown . We have our eyes See the moon , the sun , the stars , But our telescopes ... We reveal light years deep in a universe full of wonders . And what we see is ... Unimaginable . Go . This is ... I ... I never knew this place was here. this really is something . I know . I think it 's ... I think it 's really beautiful and romantic , You know ? Hey , there are fish there . - Where ? - I just saw one right there . - Appeared . - There was one there . Aha !

I mean You 're the only person ... Working on the distribution of diplomas . That was fun . Yes . Mark , what 's that ? This ? This is called radiometer . That ... that tube is vacuum sealed Responds to changes in temperature . Put your hand on it . must respond to the temperature of your hand . According ... - Maybe you 're cold-blooded . - Yes Actually , I think maybe the temperature is the same . But ... the scientists have a lot Different theories about why it works . No one is exactly sure . Just ... just it does . I mean ... That 's ... that 's really geek , Mark . I ... keep it to remind myself that There are some things even science can not explain . Yes , you must try psychology . No . Try to define human behavior . Or better yet , behavior human teenager . No way . - That 's impossible . - Yes It is a futile exercise .

And if we 're lucky , I 'll go outside and my car had followed me here . That is , Mr. Willis , this is totally improbable . - Please . - It 's okay . Still does it feel like , Mr. Willis ? Not so much . Hello friends . Welcome aboard . Mr. Willis , you . Is not so good . Bad headache . Here they are ! What took so long ? Let 's say we had technical difficulties . We have to go now .

Powerful . I came to be important . I became someone ! Jess ... This is not real , okay ? This is a dream . You ... you 're dreaming or am I dreaming . Or both are dreaming the same dream the same time . This does not feel like a dream , right ? No ... It is a kind of thing space weather . That 's what we 've come . We ? Mr. Willis and me . He 's so sexy . In some intelligently . Jess , come on . We have to solve this . So things could return to normal . What are you talking about ? I 'll tell you the reason why you want things to be as before . In your world , You 're perfect little lady . Les everyone likes you .

No crazy theater again . No , that has already been dissolved into another realm . We have something else in mind . What is this ? Some kind of instant replay ? Maddie , this is not a movie . We have to face reality . Reality ? Have you seen what has been happening ? Edgar , we gotta go . E ... wait . I thought I said we were all in this together . Do not worry . We see again soon . Come on , you gotta see this . Yes , I 've heard that before . Riley , I do not think I can do this . It is going to be okay . I will not let anything happen this time . Come on . Hi , guys . What are they doing here ? What about costumes ? Ma 'am ? Deep , Edgar ... let . Is Maddie . Unit 57 responding . Take care of yourself , Jess . You are in our thoughts . Edgar ... Rests , honey . Back to check on you later . Deep ? Sorry . Jess ... Tell me this is a hallucination . Tell me this is not real . No , Maddie , this is the truth . No . You must accept the truth . No , no ! I do not like this truth , Riley ! She 's my best friend . I can not believe is almost a month . Yes , I do not . Will you go to see it this weekend ? Yes , I see it every weekend . Do you think she knows you 're there ? I do not know . I think so . What about you ? Well ? I do not know . I hate hospitals . You 're a coward . Jess . No , you said you were love with her . Right ! I am a coward . I can not bear to see her that way . You mean that disgusts you , right ? Because it 's no longer beautiful With a large plate of metal stuck in his skull ? Jess is a vegetable ! It is no longer Maddie . She is breathing on her own . God ! Shit ! Jess , are you okay ? It was like a ... Acute Pain , but ... it is already gone . If you have to go to nursing let me know , okay ? I 'm fine . Good . Hey Jess ... Are you sure you 're okay ? Jess ... What is it ? I do not know . Wings . What ? Wings ? Let 's ... have wings chicken for lunch . Miss Carver , is there anything You want to share with the rest of the class ? No . Then I suggest you go back to work . Disgusting . I do not know why you like them . Take the rest of mine . Hello ? Jess ! What happens ? It seems to have seen a ghost . What have you been doing the last month ? That is , things have changed . This is not the way that is supposed to be . Do not you remember anything ? That is ... the planetarium ? The Clash ? The Clash ? What are you talking about ? Remember that we miss the school and went to the planetarium ? Right ? And on the way back we had an accident . Been to the hospital during the last month With a large metal plate in your skull ! Okay ... okay . Perhaps that 's you must go to hospital . Or ... you could see the Carloftis Miss . Thank you , Miss . I appreciate . We really care about this place . Hey , Jess ! Come with us ! What is your problem ? I do not know . He saw dead people or something today . Hey , Jess ! Just let us go . Hello ? Maddie ! Maddie ! Riley , what the hell was that ? You promised me the truth . The truth is there . The 're blocking . So it 's my fault ? I do not think so . We have to go , back there , Maddie . No , you back there , I 'm done . Where he is Mr. Willis and Carloftis miss ? 'll Take with them . Maddie ... Are you okay ? What happened ? Where did you go ? We were looking everywhere . You do not want to know . You just want to make me anti-doping test again . I deserve . Sorry . Did not understand . And he 's right . Many things have happened creepy . Creepy indeed . Excuse me ? The quantum entanglement . Two electrons at two different locations Establish a telepathic bond with each other that transcends Space and time . Einstein called spooky action at a distance . I think we 're in a kind of quantum entanglement . A field that can not be explained by cause and effect . Where ... where ... where laws of linear time ... No longer seem to apply . I think it started with you and Jess and that car accident . Are you calling us electrons Jess and me ? Yes , something like that . Yes . Quantum mechanics is truly a model for the study The behavior of particles , no human behavior , but think about it . What if we implement the same principles quantum And apply it to a zillion ... Trillion electron ? All right , everyone , I managed this . The show is about to begin . No , no , no . No other film . Do not worry Maddie . This system is completely digital . - Art equipment ultra high definition . - Without lens this time ? - Without lenses , Mr. Willis . Back exactly where they were . Action . My God ! Why can not we remember any of this ? This is completely backwards . How can it be a movie more real than our real life ? It 's like Edgar told you the first time , Maddie ... you 're a thought . A fiction , a memory . Memories are like the movies , just ... Our brain fragments together to build a story . May be a good story or a bad story . Yeah well , I still do not understand . We are all caught in a loop the ... Memory The head injury Jess keeps playing over and over again . His thoughts are turning our reality . Hector and Deep it explained everything before leaving . Okay , then how do we go jam ? - I did not explain that part . - Great . It 's like I 've been saying . A very , very deep ... Level . You and Jess are communicating about what happened . No . Not that again . What ... what if science could explain human behavior A ... a ... a ... a sub atomic level ? It 's like why I hear violins , right ? It 's like a frequency or membrane somehow Connects the past with the present , and then pulls us all here together . Yes . Tell me this . What things seem strange spend When you rehearse or play the violin ? Maybe sometimes . But what are you saying ? If I leave the violin , then things return to normal ? - No , no , no ... - No , that 's not what Mr. Willis Is saying , but I think that Mark is something . Love and hate . What are the two unique human energies That can transcend space and time ? I 'm lost . Okay . How is that ... A mother can know intuitively when your child is dead ? Even if they are thousands of miles away ? Love . You know ? It is the only thing that can transcend generation , space , time . It 's like being in tune to the same frequency The same channel , as Mark said . Empires whole annihilate each other Because they are trapped in stories about the past . They get stuck in the same channel . As you and Jess are stuck in a cycle of blame and guilt . So ... Jess hates me because of the accident ? It is the only explanation for what we are all caught In this cycle of spider web . The only way out is to change the thinking Jess at a very deep level . Exactly . Changing the frequency . How to change the channel . You . They do not understand ! She will never forgive me ! I ruined your life ! I ruin your life . You need to see Jess . And I 'll go with you . You do not have to be afraid . No , no . I can not do this anymore . Maddie . Come on ! Hi Jess ... What about the suit ? I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry ! I ... Do anything to change places with you . - Hello . - How it was ? Okay . You know , Jess would not have missed this for the world . Thank you . Hello ! Hi Maddie , Riley . Thank you all for coming . I really appreciate it . It is good to have familiar faces in the audience . Especially if I screw up . Do not say that . - You 'll be great . - You 'll be fantastic . See you later guys , right ? - Of course ... - Absolutely . According ... Aiyana , you scared me . That 's really a great dress . I 'm glad you 're here . Probably I should have done this yesterday . Do you think it is too much resin ? Hello , Maddie . Are you ready ? Yes , ready as always I will be , I guess . How 's your hand ? Okay . Okay . It still hurts a little . But I can still play , so ... I 'm very proud of you for participate in this recital . You know , after all you 've gone through , Demonstrates a real character . Thank you . Y ... My condolences . I 'm sorry about your friend . How are you running the new violin ? It 's good . The tone is somewhat brighter to what I 'm used to , but ... I think I like . And I sound a little more like Aiyana . Good . ¿ Aiyana ? Aiyana ! Listen , and you are advertising . Better prepared . - Kill them . - Thank you . See you . Well ... I guess I am . There is an exhibition at the science museum . You want to go ? You know , I have a better idea . There is a poetry reading at the center . Do you want there instead ? Only if you let me drive this time . Done .

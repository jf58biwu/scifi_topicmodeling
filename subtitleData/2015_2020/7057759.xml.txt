 Sire , forgive me for this , but I know no other way . Your empire needs you . [ giggling ] [ gasps ] [ Pidge ] He fought us here , his generals were here , and he stole the comet here . So , Lotor could be anywhere . We 'll never be able to find him unless we can figure out his plan . - We 're totally missing the big picture . - How about this question ? Why was Voltron made out of the same material as that comet ? What 's so special about it ? My father discovered another comet like that before I was born . Your father ... and Zarkon . This is back when Zarkon was the Black Lion 's paladin ? Before that . Before Alfor built the lions . I know this is painful to talk about , but if we 're going to stop Lotor , it 's time we heard the rest of the story . In the beginning , the paladins were just five leaders , who despite coming from cultures which were vastly divergent and in some cases , had been warring for generations ... managed to look past their differences in an effort to protect their common interests . What was initially a formal agreement to work alongside each other soon blossomed into a true friendship . A warrior 's bond was forged , and together , they worked to rid their system of those who would do it harm . Oh , dear . [ grunting ] - [ clanging ] - Huh ? [ clanging ] [ screams ] [ both grunting ] [ grunts ] [ grunts ] I keep warning you not to break formation and run ahead , Alfor . You are much more knowledgeable as an alchemist than a soldier . That 's what I keep you around for , Zarkon . [ Coran ] The original paladins were Zarkon from Planet Daibazaal , King Alfor from Altea , Gyrgan from Rygnirath , Trigel of the Dalterion Belt and Blaytz from Nalquod . Mm . Pull up a bench and join the feast ! [ Zarkon clears throat ] You know that fraternizing with the servant class is not permitted . It erodes discipline . Well , perhaps a bit of discipline erosion would do you good , Zarkon . Something I will consider the next time you are surrounded by Lambonite scavengers . I was handling myself . You mean wetting yourself ? [ all laughing ] Why I ever joined up with this band of scoundrels , I 'll never know . Because we 're the only band of scoundrels that would have you . To us ! - [ rumbling ] - [ all gasp ] By Willow ! [ Coran ] They could have never known that , that very night , the fate of the universe would be changed forever . [ Zarkon ] I have finished evacuating all Galra citizens near the crater . - What have you discovered ? - We 're not sure . This comet is like none seen before . It seems to be made of a material that can pass between realities . What do you mean ? Well , I mean that sages have always theorized that there are many realities stacked side by side with each other . Whole other universes with their own histories unbeknownst to us . But we never had any proof . Until now . When we moved the comet , we found this . This ... is another reality ? - [ screams ] What is that ? - [ meows ] Do not worry . It is only Kova . He is from our reality . Zarkon , this is Honerva . She is the best alchemist on Altea . I asked her to come to Daibazaal and lead the scientific investigation . Her expertise will be invaluable . Isn 't it exciting ? It could change the way we understand our entire universe . Well , find out everything you can . I will provide any support you require . I must go . He didn 't stay long . [ Coran ] King Alfor experimented with the comet 's ore in his lab on Altea , as Honerva continued her research of the rift on Daibazaal . But Alfor visited often as the years passed . Zarkon , I 'd like you to meet Princess Allura . It is my pleasure . Please accept this gift in honor of your birth , Princess . Honerva has really softened you up , my friend . I never thought I 'd see the day the great warrior Emperor Zarkon was married , to an Altean alchemist , no less . Honerva , working hard as always . Many thanks for the gift . Allura loves it . It was a customary gesture . Of course . - How is our quintessence experiment ? - Still running . Running for a full year on one drop of quintessence , with no decline in revolutions per dobosh . No other energy source like this exists . The ships I 'm creating for us work on the same principle , and the ore from the comet practically engineers itself . It 's frightening , in a way . Endlessly powerful ships for the Galra Empire . And an endless source of clean energy for the entire system . Of course . Huh ? What is that ? I sent some signals into the neighboring reality and this creature answered the call . Nothing from our universe has been able to survive the passage through the rift . - But somehow , he arrived unharmed . - [ Alfor ] What ? I thought we discussed this . We must exercise caution . We have no idea what is out there . The ancients thought that lightning was shot from the bows of the gods until science proved otherwise . We must always push into dangerous territory in pursuit of knowledge . [ screeching ] [ Coran ] King Alfor and Honerva erected a particle barrier around the crater , containing the creatures . But it wouldn 't hold forever . The barrier is weakening . We don 't have long . Once those creatures escape , my forces will quickly be overrun . My planet , my people ... - Alfor 's project will save us . - Let us hope . I trust this plan of yours will work , Alfor . [ gasps ] By Willow ! Incredible . Alfor , they 're amazing . How do they work ? I made them from the quintessence-infused ore of the comet , which provides them with an endless supply of power . Remarkable ! [ Alfor ] The comet alloy also renders them nearly indestructible . [ Blaytz ] What sort of weaponry do they have ? This is where things become more interesting . Altean alchemy can accomplish some incredible feats of engineering , as you know . But in testing my ship , I started to feel some sort of psychic link . I 'm not sure how to explain it , but the ship wasn 't just reading my mind . It was communicating with me . They seem to be evolving . We don 't yet know what powers these ships possess , but we may gain understanding with time . Time ? Time slips away even as we stand here . My people will soon be slaughtered by dark creatures from another realm . Without these ships , all hope is lost . I understand . It may take some doing . These are not regular ships to be chosen at a whim . You do not pick the beast . The beast will choose you . [ growls ] [ roars ] Yeah ! [ laughing ] [ Alfor ] Now , go easy at the beginning . This is greater energy than you have ever worked with before . [ Zarkon ] Perhaps you should lead the formation , Alfor . You have a greater understanding of the vessels than anyone . I 'm a better alchemist than military leader , Zarkon . I 'll stick with being your right hand . Very well , then . On my mark , Paladins ! Right flank , Alfor and Blaytz . Left flank , Trigel and Gyrgan . [ Zarkon ] Paladins , I 'll fly ahead and divert its attention . The rest of you , attack from all sides ! Fire ! Keep firing ! - [ grunts ] - [ alarm blaring ] These blasted things are covering me ! Blaytz ! - Th-Thanks , Alfor ! - Anytime . [ yelling ] Spinning head smash ! [ yelling ] - I can 't hit it ! - Fall back , Paladins ! We must regroup ! Wait ! We must come together in formation . What ? Why ? I don 't know , but somehow I can feel it . - Hey , I feel it ! - I do , too ! What 's happening ? [ lion growls ] [ Alfor ] Voltron . [ rumbling ] [ all yelling ] I can 't believe we did it ! How did this come about ? Am I a leg ? This power , it 's unbelievable . This is Voltron . [ grunts , gasps ] - [ Trigel ] A shield ! - [ Zarkon ] Well done , Trigel ! - [ grunts ] It 's trying to rip into us ! - We have to get it off ! [ grunts , gasps ] I know what to do . [ Alfor ] We must find a way to seal up this rift . - Seal the rift ? Why ? - It nearly destroyed Daibazaal ! Those creatures nearly destroyed Daibazaal , and you found a way to defeat them . Zarkon , surely you agree with me . - It must be closed . - Perhaps not . Look at what we 've gained , Alfor . Your ships are the most powerful machines ever created . Who knows what else may be discovered if we continue working ? You would risk your entire planet , the entire solar system , for what ? - For more power ? - You know it 's more than that . We already have Voltron . You have to know when it 's enough . I 'll decide what 's enough on my planet ! [ gasps ] I 'm sorry , Alfor . The work will continue . [ Coran ] Honerva continued her experiments on the rift . Despite their differences , Zarkon and Alfor , along with the other paladins , established a new era of peace and prosperity . It was an age of exploration , and Voltron became known as the Defender of the Universe , establishing the legend that would live on to this day . [ Alfor ] I heard there were three more earthquakes this movement . Don 't worry , I 'm installing stabilizers to strengthen the planet 's cohesion . Zarkon , my scientists have scanned Daibazaal . It is fracturing . Soon , the structural integrity will- - I can 't stop Honerva 's work now ! She 's discovering more every day ! Her team has developed a space cruiser five times the size of our current largest ship . - But that 's nothing . - Hello , Honerva . It 's been deca-phoebs . [ Honerva ] I hope you haven 't come to try to shut down my work . There is more hidden knowledge and power in this tiny fissure than you can possibly understand . I 'm only worried about the stability- [ purrs ] - Is that Kova ? How old is he ? [ Honerva ] Twenty-eight deca-phoebs old . Shortly after the creatures attacked , he fell ill . But then , I began treating him with quintessence . - No . - [ Honerva ] He revealed the truth to us . Quintessence is so much more than you can understand . - It is life itself . - You 've gone too far . You 've always been a coward . Honerva , you- - You wish to close off our gateway to enlightenment . We should be expanding it ! If we use Voltron , we can enlarge the opening to the other reality . It 's madness ! This prolonged exposure to quintessence has poisoned your minds ! We 've only scratched the surface . We can rule this entire universe ! We can live forever ! All of us ! - I cannot be a part of this . - You are only one part of Voltron , Alfor . You cannot hold us all back because of your fear ! Alfor , I lead the paladins ! I command you ! Alfor ! [ sighs weakly ] Honerva ? Honerva ! [ Honerva breathing heavily ] [ Honerva ] We mu- - We must ... We must have ... We must have it . - Get back , get back , get back ... - What is it , my love ? Uh , quinte- - quintessence . Quintessence is life . [ takes sharp breath ] Into the- - Into the rift . [ moans ] How ? We mu- - We must- - We must have Voltron . Voltron . Voltron . [ gasping ] Voltron ! Voltron . Voltron ... It is the only way . [ Zarkon ] Alfor tried to warn me , but I would not listen . Now , my wife has fallen ill , and my planet is on the brink of collapse . So I must beg you , my trusted comrades , to join me on a most dangerous quest . We must close the rift , and I need Voltron to do it . We will help you . I only hope it is not too late to heal the rift in my planet ... and our friendship . [ Coran ] Alfor 's compassion for his old comrade blinded him to Zarkon 's true plans . [ Zarkon ] Honerva told me the only way to close the rift was to use the power of the quintessence . We must make the opening bigger first to gather the power . - How do we that ? - We use the sword . Form sword ! - It 's too much ! - Stay focused ! [ groans , gasps ] Huh ? [ breathing heavily ] [ groaning ] [ groans ] Uh ... [ groaning ] Where are we ? - We 've entered the rift . - [ whirring ] [ alarm blaring ] No ! Zarkon , what are you doing ? We have to get them out of here ! We must hurry . The creatures have returned ! They 're everywhere ! [ grunting ] [ screaming ] Fire all lasers ! [ Alfor ] Trigel , grab them ! Gyrgan , Blaytz , fire your thrusters ! We must leave ! [ Coran ] Zarkon 's attempt to save Honerva was in vain . They both succumbed to overexposure of quintessence . The paladins had been deceived by Zarkon . They had unwittingly enlarged the rift , which further destabilized Planet Daibazaal . King Alfor was forced to evacuate the planet . He , then , closed the rift the only way he knew how . By destroying the Galran homeworld . King Alfor held a state funeral for Zarkon and Honerva in his royal hall . But what happened next , he could never have guessed . [ ominous music playing ] Mmm . [ breathing uneasily ] - Where am I ? - Aboard your ship , sir . Take us home . I can 't , sir . Daibazaal has been destroyed . My fellow Galra ... King Alfor of Altea has destroyed our planet . He must pay dearly for his crimes . Rise up and join your emperor ! Revenge will be ours ! [ Coran ] Zarkon had become pure evil , obsessed only with quintessence . In order to open a new rift between the realities , he needed Voltron . And so , the war began . The Galra immediately responded to their leader and attacked . The peaceful planets of our system were not prepared . Soon , they had all fallen , except for Altea . In a final attempt to keep Voltron from Zarkon 's hands , the lions were sent to the far corners of the universe . Zarkon flew into a rage . He killed King Alfor , then avenged the loss of Daibazaal with the destruction of Altea . So , that 's Lotor 's plan . To cross into other universes and get the purest quintessence possible . No matter what , we have to stop him . [ screams ] [ breathing heavily ] Husband . How could I have forgotten ? You brought me back to life long ago . Now , come back for me .

Why ... he ... among all ? Why ? Than ? Why the hell would I ? Are we There Yet . Keep it up , I 'll get the kids . Adam . Be careful . - Does anyone know what this is ? - Anyone ? This is part of the model ... Price evolution of altruism recited from memory by ... 8 year old girl unconscious . Why the thought of dying ... this girl is an equation known only by Price himself ? This moment forever changed my perspective of science in mind . Kayla call the phenomenon . The experience of channeling a memory ... or information that is not yours . There are countless examples of this phenomenon . This 6 year old girl from Kentucky who never took a flying lesson ... but he landed a small plane while his father suffered a stroke . While this patient can explain every detail of the wedding of his brother ... 3200 having been away in a coma . This is not science fiction , it 's real . I am looking for a small grant to continue my research isolating the cause ... this phenomenon . Imagine how shared experiences can change ... our future or join our brains for complex applications . Forget the equation . We can literally have a situation where ... any of us feel what any other in ... any moment . Is really ... la red social definitiva . - That was awesome . - Sorry , I did not identify . Doctor , we 've got you . Want to see . Adam , Where the hell are you ? We recommend that you stay at home until further notice . This is not a drill , I repeat ... What the hell is going on ? I 'm sorry friend . God . Please stay home until next government notice . This is not a drill ... ¡ Katie ! Katie . Katie , Clark . - Tell me , where is he ? - You should not be so worried . - After all , she is not alone . - Clark ? This Clark . All we end up together . Runs across the field ... crying . His legs tremble . Not succeed for long . Tell me , where are they ? There it goes . Poor girl . Clark is above him . You are scared . - There will soon be finished . - Stop it . I stop him . What I can do with it ? It is done . Just simple . Fuck , what did you do ? We 've improved . It will soon be with us . It is much better that way . You will see . - She is talking . - Than ? What do you say , Jess ? - Adam , Where ? - Jess , tell me please . Dammit . Adam , let us in . We know that a sign tells you that we do not let go - Ignore her . We should talk . - I 'm fine thanks . Relax , Adam . If we wanted you dead would have burned the building . - Go , Clark . - Actually there is nothing you can do . One way or another enter there . Open the door and do it for the good . We will say what we have to say and then we 'll leave . You have our word . If you try something you 're dead . So much is enough . Adam ... even 're a lost boy . He is fighting for nothing . Where is she ? Is that what it is ? What you 've lost your girlfriend ? - Do you feel you 're in control ? - If you do not tell me where this Katie ... I will scatter inside your skull in the fucking ground . You hate us for taking us to Katie , right ? It was easy , you left her in that truck . - I did not do it . - You did it . - No , I did not do it . - When we found her she was alone . - I was afraid . - Shut . Shut . You did not go for it . The abandoned . I was so scared . - What 's going on ? - You could I rescuing her . You could do it but left it at our mercy . You left . She begged him not we converted . I was the one who did it . How does it feel ? Do you feel what it is to lose someone ? We have seen that intense anger is the best cure for your situation . Clark . The truth is ... I do not hate . I love you like a brother . - Yes ? - Yes . But I have a message for you ... you deliver all your buddies . There 's something I want you to see . The find you . - Do not waste your anger . - I 'm not angry . Where I am ? - Fuck . What the hell is going on ? - Jess ? Jess ! Jess ! - Jess , stop . - I do not know you , please . Jess stop , look at me . I 'm Adam , please , tell me where this Katie . I do not know , I do not know . - How do I look ? - Beautiful . - Adam , you must go . - Do not . - You must get out of here ! - No no . - You can still have your life . - I will not let Katie . - I was wrong about you . - No , you were not . Until the week ... would last downhill eating cake . Waiting for the government to intervene . - How good . - Yes . You know , you could argue that one of the worst things that has happened to me . - I 'm sorry I ruined your life . - It 's okay . It 's okay . It was not a big deal anyway . It 's okay . - Okay , Katie . - I 'm scared . I know . I know . I came back . We are here . Remember . Remember , we 're going . Concentrate , concentrate , concentrate . Russian weird experiment . This thing called bag , do not know what is . Dammit . They are all connected . True ? This is your base of operations . Hire as many attendees as appropriate display . Carefully selected , of course . His laboratory staff . If there is any need to implement not here , let me know ... and you 'll get it as soon as possible . Just remember that we are a ... company moves within the government . Notes previous experiments . - I do not speak Russian . - Here are the translations . Initial results are encouraging , the subjects are connected telepathically ... and they learn to share their thoughts and memories . They are a single entity . As a honeycomb working in unison . No individual desires . In rare cases the subjects were able to disconnect yourself from others ... short periods of time . I called these issues bags . During these times individuality is restored . Suffer from disorientation ... and memory loss . In most the majority of cases the subjects with these bags . After being confronted with external stimuli restored ... an emotional bond . This is 20 years old at least . - Where did this come from ? - A Soviet program discontinued . Those communists were strange things but ... you . I continue ... - Where they left ? - What is that thing on your skin ? Side effects of the virus . We hope that you can delete but ... It is not the main priority . Fear about the inevitable malicious use . My job is to create solutions for future disasters . Do you understand ? When do I start ? Oh shit . I can intervene in the memories of anyone . Dammit . What I can see everything . Absolutely everything . The more memories we share , the more we become equal . The formula for the perfect life . Awake 16 hours a day . 30 minutes a day for exercise . 137 minutes with loved ones . 7 minutes to be sexually active . Only a disaster mutated to the same goal . Perfection . I am not one of them . Well , I 'm off . But I 'm not one of them . I remember . I came to this camp since he was a child . I created constant links with women to combat loneliness . Jodi my best friend . I 'm the fool who opened the head to Katie ... and could not protect . 288 friends on Facebook . 215 friends on Instagram . And the memories of seven billion people stuck in my head . I need to concentrate . I will remember it if I concentrate . Fuck . It is like ... I can remember anything . It 's like Google . Well , concentrate on something . Enough of that . What 's going on ? What happens ? Your you got out of it , right ? So , whatever you did ... - It also can . - I do not know , do not know what you mean . Jess , what happened ? Please tell me . - Than ? Jess , tell me . - I do not know . I ... found something . - I was terrified and I. - Think . I saw , I saw faces . I saw your face and hers and then ... I do not know , I woke up in this chair ... and I 'm tied to it . It is all I know . Wait , if you remember anything of your life or something emotional , can you get out of it ? - I need your help . Okay , Jess ? - According . We leave this dump . I promise you . Good . Dr. Baker has another applicant in his office . I hope ... Well , I 'll go now . - What 's going on ? - Hope . - Hello . I 'm Dr. Baker , and you ... is ? - My name is Yuri . - Sorry , I thought his name was .. - Is Yuri - Sorry , I thought his name was ... - Is Yuri . - Well , are you familiar with the job ? - I 'm not here for the job . - I do not understand , are very busy . - My name is Yuri . - Yes , I know that . - Yegorov . - Dr. Yegorov . - When Katie becomes ... We remember something and will come back as you . - That will not work . - Why not ? It 's too late ! I have so many questions for you . I have read all your notes . - The virus is very resistant to change . - Dr. Baker , is what ud. goes . The virus will become hostile and spread . His intelligence and mental power beyond our own . It is impossible to control . - This ... is evil . - With all due respect Dr. , we do not agree . Not qualify because you malignant . Failure control . I reviewed their work for months , I thought I was a genius . Dr. Baker , do you know what the word " Koniek " ? - I do not know . - It means ... The end . Dammit . Katie . Katie , stay with me . Katie ... I 'll fix this . And then I 'll come back for you . Katie ... stay alive . Adam , espera . Where is she ? The find you . Katie . - I expected . - Watch Katie . Look at me . Yes ? You can get through this . Just remember who you are . Remember what 's important to you . We know . We have the right to do so . We have come to change . And we are achieving . You return to consciousness , and be back with us . It 's better this way , Adam . Do not you see ? - You never again be alone . - No no . We know how this ends . We are one . We all want the same thing . - It is important that you do not feel sad . - Where does this conversation ? Crushing his head with you ... Katie ... the bat . You think you 're smarter than me ? So where is everyone ? Why has not this place burned to the ground ? You saw what I did with Clark . Why not send your henchmen ... - So you saved ? - You are not a threat to us . - This body is not important . - It 's important to me . - We know . - Do you know ? When you ... I said about my feelings for you , before any of this happened ... it was not real yet . You 're not as smart as you think you are . You were wrong with the bat . I 'll make a rule . You can not say those words to someone ... until you really feel them , OK ? Until you really feel . Until you feel it deep and not to be able to shut up because ... you will explode and you can not avoid . Until then , do not use them , okay ? Te amo , Katie . Good . This was apparently a jolt of electricity to restart my heart ... and then I woke up in the hospital . Is dying . Is dying . Up up up . C 'mon C 'mon . Thank goodness . Well , I hope this works . Katie , wake up . Katie . Wake Katie , please ! ¿ Katie ? Well , it worked . Sit , sit . Come on . It 's okay . It 's okay . Katie . Concentrate . Trust me . Trust me . Katie , please . Who the hell is Katie ? And who the hell are you ? Cursed , that 's fine . Adam , espera . When you leave it , you have no memories at all . No idea who ... you were or where you were , so I 'll leave a little note . A reminder . Please , I do not want to redo it . I think I did above . Can you , please , tell me what the hell is happening now ? Everything will make more sense when your memories begin to return to you . Fuck . For now we leave this nursing . - All right . - There 's a van in the parking lot . It is our best chance . If we take the path may not notice us to leave . - I can not remember . - Katie . Katie . Katie , you 'll have to trust me , okay ? Everything will be fine . There are masks ... and gloves behind the desk nurse , okay ? We will bring you ... - Antes de marcharnos . - Good . Come on . Good . - Nobody move ! - Do as he says . Step back , step back . Give me the samples . All . - Do not do this . - Dr. Baker , unless you want to die ... Today I suggest you do everything I say . Put them inside . - Is that all you got ? - Yes Yes . Is that all you got ? Come on. get out of the hell out of here . Is better . Deténgase . Katie van . Yuri , wait . You do not understand . Start the plane ! For the love of God , start the plane ! Start the plane ! Wait . Wait wait . Well , you win . Me rindo . Remember . Please sign in . Remember . Katie recalls , please remember it . Katie recalls . Maybe I lied . But soon ... I remember everything . You know . Remember the speed and aggressiveness with which ... swarm spread everywhere . Remember the last moments of humanity collapsing . Remember the 5 days locked in the infirmary step starving ... waiting for me to find the bag . So he could save us . You 'll notice that there is no place that ... we can go , that I lied . Nothing will be fine . But for now still she has hope . Katie once told me that love is ... a false reality . And now I 'll build one . I ... to ... master .

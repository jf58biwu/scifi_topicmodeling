 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . Who are you ? ! [ BOTH ] I don 't know . Who are you ? I got no idea . [ ONE ] We all woke up just like you ; no idea who we are or how we got here . [ TWO ] She 's an android . We 're on course for a nearby inhabited world . [ GIRL ] Well , you 're welcome to resupply and help yourself to whatever you need , then you best be off . Why is that ? [ WOMAN ] You wanna be long gone before the Raza get here . The Raza ? Obviously we were meant to help these people . The " Raza " is the name of this ship . We 're not here to help these people . We 're here to kill them . No . That 's impossible . That can 't be right can it ? [ THE ANDROID ] I recovered the information from a fragment of the ship 's logs related to the crew list . There 's no reason to doubt its veracity . [ TWO ] Of course not . In fact , it all makes perfect sense now The Raza- - This ship . But as far as the miners are concerned : a race of bloodthirsty aliens- - monsters , come to wipe them out . [ SIX ] But the truth is we 're nothing but a bunch of low-life mercenaries . [ THREE ] No , we 're better than that . We 're also pirates and smugglers and thieves . It 's a very diversified portfolio . You think this is funny ? It 's my defense mechanism : humor . That , and apparently , killing people . I think we need to talk about our next move . Well , he 's right , you know . Oh , listen , I don 't wanna be the one to say it , but if all this stuff is true , we came here to do a job . [ ONE ] You wanna go down to the planet and kill those people ? No one 's killing anyone . [ THREE ] I didn 't say I wanted to kill anyone . I 'm just talking about the people who hired us . Ferrous Corporation . Galactic combine . Exactly . Not the sort of folks you wanna disappoint . I 'm guessing . Too bad . I 'm no murderer . [ THREE ] It 's funny , ' cause the screen says otherwise . Yeah , I don 't care what it says . [ THREE ] So , have you managed to uncover anything else ? Unfortunately , the rest of the data was corrupted . I suppose that 's plenty . Hell of a lot more than I wanted to know anyways . [ FOUR ] We all wanted to know . These are the memories we left behind . Death , despair , chaos . So what ? If they 're no longer a part of us now , then what does it even matter ? Tsk . Yeah ... Should I continue my attempts at data recovery ? [ THE ANDROID ] Portia ? Don 't ... Don 't call me that ... No computer file is going to tell me who I am . Call me " Two . " Okay , Two . [ gasps ] I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . You didn 't startle me . You scared the crap out of me sneaking up like that . My stealth subroutines are very efficient . Well , dial them back , or say something next time you walk into a room . [ THE ANDROID ] Are you afraid of them now ? You think I should be ? They show a history of violence , mental instability , extreme anti-social behavior , deceit- - What 's important is who they are now . An admirable attitude . Also , potentially a very foolish and dangerous one . Hey , you 're the one who tried to kill us . The result of a programmed directive which has since been deleted . Same with them maybe , right ? If it 's not fear , then why are you upset ? What makes you think I 'm upset ? I can see a muscular tension in your jaw and shoulders . I can hear a slight increase in both respiratory rate and heart rate . I can smell a distinct shift in pheromone production- - Okay , okay . I get it . Look , if you wanna know it 's because I 'm the only one who 's not in the files . I 'm not one of the crew . So ... how did I get onboard this ship ? At least they know they belong here . I 'm still just a big question mark . There may come a time that you 'll consider yourself lucky not to be counted as a member of this crew . Well , right now , I just ... wish I was part of the team . Oh ... and one more thing ... Maybe don 't go around telling people you can smell their pheromones . It 's not gonna win you any friends . But I can smell them . [ SIX ] Weapons array , sensors , navigation and critical controls . Flip these ... punch that ... hit these two ... you bring the engines online . How do you know how to fly this thing ? I don 't know , I just do . Huh . [ SIX ] Maybe you do , too . You gotta try . [ THREE ] Yep ... wait a minute ... - -That 's it ... - - [ alarms sounding ] - - [ SIX ] Oh ... no , no , no . - - [ alarms sounding ] Ah , maybe not ... [ sighs ] Y 'know , I just can 't concentrate , this whole thing 's got me thinking , that 's all . Yeah , tell me about it . Which one of us do you thinks got the baddest rep ? - -What ? - - [ THREE ] Hm ? Yeah , I mean , just based on what we know about each other , which is not a lot to go on , I know , how would you rank us in order of Most Wanted , from , like , " super bad-ass " , all the way on down to " cause for concern . " Hm ? [ THREE ] For instance , I 'd put me in first spot , you 'd slide right there in second ... Boss Lady , well , she 'd be third , account of her ba 'ttitude ... OI ' Slashy Stabberson , fourth . Pretty Boy and the kid ... tied for last place 'cause it looks like she 's got a bit of a temper . You 're being serious ? [ THREE ] You 'd rate her higher ? Yeah ... maybe . This doesn 't bother you at all ? What ? The fact that we 're wanted criminals ? That if we get caught , we 'll spend the rest of our lives locked away , if we 're lucky ? The fact that from here on in , we 'll be the targets of our former victims ; Their friends , loved ones , and anyone else looking to cash in on our bounties . None of whom , by the way , we 'll see coming because we don 't remember a thing past yesterday . Not really . [ SIX ] No-no-no-no-no . Don 't-don 't-don 't ... No , no-no . I 've been thinking ... Yeah , that 's something you need to get under control . Those weapons in the cargo hold , the matching pendants ... At first , I thought it meant that we were supposed to help the miners- - that we were their ... saviors . But now I 'm wondering if it means that we killed their saviors and heisted the delivery . Your point ? [ ONE ] If I 'm right , Ferrous Corp. Isn 't gonna let this go . If we don 't finish the job , they 'll just send someone else . Which is why we stick to the plan . The miners get half the weapons , and a fighting chance . [ ONE ] We can do more . Go all the way . Commit to something . We can fight with them . That would be suicide . [ ONE ] Not necessarily . Look , if half of what 's in those files is true , then ... we can handle ourselves . It also means you could spend the rest of your life doing good deeds and not even come close to making up for it . I know what you 're trying to do , and it 's not going to work . You don 't want to believe what those computer files say you are , fair enough . I don 't much want to either . But I 'm not gonna kill myself trying to make up for crimes I don 't even remember committing . We stick to the plan . [ ONE ] And who made you team leader ? I did ... by stepping up . And so did all of you by not challenging me when I did . Unless ... Unless you 've had a change of heart and think you can do a better job . Didn 't think so . [ sighs ] [ SIX ] Try that , is it on ? [ ONE ] Yeah . [ SIX ] Okay , [ THREE ] Seriously ... [ FOUR ] Yeah . ... what 's with the sword ? It 's quicker , more effective in close quarter combat . More effective than a gun ? Without a doubt . You think you could outdraw me with that thing ? I would have your head cut off before you could even unholster . He ) " I need to talk to you . [ SIX ] Oooh . [ TWO ] Look , I may have been a little hard on you before . Believe me , I know how you feel . We all do . But 10 minutes after finding out you used to be a villain is not the time to try to be a hero . There is no room for independent action . We need to stick together and watch each others ' backs . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? I ... think so . Once the weapons are delivered and that shuttle comes back , I want you on it . Understood ? Yeah . All right . Safe flight . [ TWO ] Stop staring at my ass . [ GIRL ] Hey , I 'm sorry we couldn 't do more for you . It 's just we gave everything we had to Hrothgar . [ ONE ] Don 't worry about it . Well , what are you gonna tell your employer ? I mean , how are you going to explain- - Intergalactic transport 's a risky business . Cargo gets misplaced or stolen all the time . Insurance 'll cover it . [ GIRL ] You 're good people . No , we 're not . [ GIRL ] Of course you are . You 've helped us , I mean , you probably saved our lives . I 'm beginning to think it 's just the opposite . By giving you these weapons , I-I 'm afraid we 're just giving you false hope . [ whispers ] Look , you ... you can 't win this . If you stay here and fight , you 'll die . I 'm hoping it 's not gonna come to that . We have help coming , and more weapons . [ THREE ] That 's the spirit . Don 't let the bastards get you down . As for us , we gotta get back to our spaceship . - -Not yet . - - [ THREE ] Oh . At least allow us to thank you . Ah , that bloodthirsty look in your eyes , all the thanks I need . With song and drink . Well , who doesn 't love a good song , huh ? Oh ! [ WOMAN laughs ] [ THREE ] Well ... [ keypad beeps ] [ FIVE ] Oh , hey . I took another look at that console on the bridge , but I think it 's really fried . At least until we can get some spare parts . Sorry . Yeah , that 's okay . Hey , can I ask you something ? I know you didn 't exactly get the answers you were looking for , but ... if you could go back to when we first woke up , and ... and not know , would you ? [ sighs ] I suppose I might . But I have a feeling that not knowing would just make rne wanna know all over again . Well , I guess ... the next big mystery that needs solving is who stole our memories . No one stole our memories . It was an accident . No , it wasn 't . [ THE ANDROID ] Two , you need to come to the bridge immediately . [ TWO sighs ] What is it ? Another ship . It 's just dropped out of FTL . Who is it ? Ferrous Corporation destroyer . They 've already launched a shuttle . It 's headed towards the planet 's surface . We 've gotta get our people off that planet . Did you contact the Marauder and warn them ? I attempted communication but received no response . Shit . [ beeping ] We 're being hailed by the other ship . - -Would you like- - - -I ignore it . Marauder , this is the Raza . You 've got trouble headed your way . [ TWO ] Marauder , do you read ? - - [ drinks banging ] - - [ THREE laughing ] [ chanting , cheering ] [ laughing ] We drink their drink , eat their food , and then just ... leave them here to die . [ SIX ] Hey , if you 've got another suggestion that doesn 't involve us dying here with them , I 'd love to hear it . Maybe we should tell them the truth . [ SIX ] What , that we 're mercenaries sent here to kill them ? They should know that no more help is coming . It won 't make a difference . [ ONE ] Maybe not . But we might . Don 't even think about it . We 're very , very bad people who 've done some very bad things . This is our chance to put our unique skill set to good use . We stand alongside these miners and when Ferrous Corp. comes , we hurt them . Hurt them so bad they think twice about bothering with this planet . What ? ! You are nothing if not predictable . Two told me you 'd say all of that , practically word for word . She also said to do whatever it takes to bring you back with us . Including knocking you out and dragging you back if I have to . Really ? Now she did ask me not to hit you in the face though . [ MAN ] Ferrous Corp. is here ! Ferrous Corp. is here ! Go , go ! [ SIX ] He- - hey ! Marauder , this is The Raza . Are you there ? We might consider the possibility that they 've already encountered the Ferrous Corp. shuttle . Patch me through to the destroyer . Done . This is The Raza . Please , respond . This is The Raza . Please respond . [ NIEMAN ] This is Commander Nieman of the FCS Deliverance . Took you long enough . Apologies . What can I do for you , Commander ? [ NIEMAN ] Well , you can start by telling me what the hell is goin ' on ? Why you didn 't complete your mission or update us on your status ? There were some complications we had to contend with , but we have everything under control now . Please have your shuttle fall back . [ NIEMAN ] Negative , Raza . Contingency plans have been enacted . Again , that won 't be necessary , Deliverance . This is our show . [ NIEMAN ] Not anymore it 's not . Raza , I 'm on my way over . [ gun fires ] [ MAN B ] That 's far enough ! [ MAN C ] Is that any way to act , after Ferrous Corp. made you such a generous offer ? ! Generous ? ! You 'd turn us into slaves on our own land ! One last chance to reconsider ! [ ONE ] Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Whoa ! Hold on ! Hold on ! Hold on , please ! Hold up . [ ONE ] No one wants a fight here . You had a job to do , Corso . Well , we took some time to think things through and ... decided on a change of plans . Take your men and leave . Tell your bosses we 're with these people now . [ MAN C ] You can 't be serious . What did they offer you ? [ ONE ] You know us . You know what we 're capable of . Think of the losses . It 's not worth it . Find another planet . It 's not my call . I 'll have to take this upstairs . Fair enough . [ guns firing ] [ grunting ] [ yelling ] We 're under fire ! I repeat , we 're under fire ! The mercs have turned , they 're with the miners now ! We need back up ! Shut the hell up . That actually went better than I thought it would . [ THE ANDROID ] The shuttle is approaching . [ TWO ] Go . Hide . And don 't come out until we tell you it 's safe . Ga ! [ THE ANDROID ] The shuttle is within weapons range . What about their ship ? Can we take it ? We have an advantage with speed and maneuverability , but this ship is still far from fully operational . Welcome aboard . [ MAN ] Hey , you 're gonna be fine , here . [ GIRL ] You have medical training ? - - [ SIX ] Uh , yeah ... - - [ MAN ] You doin ' okay ? ... I guess so . [ GIRL ] That 's great . We could really use your expertise . [ THREE sighs ] Nope . We can 't stay . Of course we can . [ ONE ] Just long enough to help the injured . We 're leavin ' right now . You selfish son-of-a- - [ SIX ] He 's right . It 's a long hike back to the Marauder and there could be more of them out there . [ MAN B ] Wait a minute , y-you 're gonna abandon us ? Got your weapons , staying was never part of the deal . [ MAN B ] Neither was killing those soldiers . But now you 're just going to leave us here to deal with the fallout ! [ THREE ] Friend , the fallout would 've been so much worse if we hadn 't been here . So you 're welcome . [ MAN B ] Please , I mean you 've got a shuttle- - a-a ship . [ ONE ] That 's right . And they 're at your disposal if any of you wanna leave . Look , you stood up , you made your point , but now , it 's time to go . This is a war you can 't win . Please . You 're all a bunch of cowards . All of you . Hagen , that 's enough . This is our battle . We can 't expect anyone else to fight it for us . These men risked their lives , offered more than we had any right to expect of them . Now , we have help coming . When it gets here , we 'll be fine . [ MAN ] We appreciate all you 've done for us . [ MAN ] Good luck . [ FIVE grunts ] So ... Do either of you possess offspring ? You were hired to do a job . [ TWO ] Like I said , complications arose . And continue to do so apparently . On my way over , I received word that we suffered casualties on the planet . Yeah , well , I 'm sorry to hear that- - And that your team was responsible . Ours is a cutthroat business . In this sector alone we 're competing with six other multicorps for planetary resources . Our major rival , the Mikkei Combine , have been particularly aggressive . The discovery of that tarium vein is a major coup- - one the company seeks to start exploiting immediately . That planet is the only hospitable world in range . Then maybe you should 've started with the fair offer instead of trying to bully the miners into submission . [ NIEMAN ] I didn 't come here to talk about what we can do for them . I came here to discuss what we could do for you . I 'm listening . You took payment in advance , and then failed to complete the job . That 's bad business . Lucky for you , I 'm feeling generous today . I 'm willing to call it even . In exchange for ? [ NIEMAN ] Turn this ship around and leave immediately . That 's it ? Just walk away ? [ NIEMAN ] What 's about to happen on that planet- - Well , it would be better if there are no witnesses . I still have people down there . [ NIEMAN ] Oh , they made their choice . They opened fire on Ferrous Corp. personnel , they have to answer for that . I suggest you don 't make the same mistake . If it makes it easier , I 'm willing to throw in a bonus just for you . How much ? [ THREE sighs ] Let 's get the hell off this rock . Uh , we 've got a problem . What ? The ship ... It 's not there . What do you mean " it 's not there " ? I 'm telling you , it 's not there . The Raza 's gone . [ MAN ] I am so sorry . We lead you into this . If you hadn 't taken the time to give us those weapons , you 'd never been caught down here . We wanted to help . Still do . This isn 't your fight . It is now . Well , I can 't tell a man how to live his life , I 'm not gonna tell him how to end it . [ WOMAN ] Okay , so , we could use some fresh eyes on the perimeter . Patrol 's growing mighty thin . We have no way to anticipate when or where this next attack will come . Maybe there is . [ door creaks ] Double-crossing us was a big mistake . You and your friends are gonna die . HOW ? Tell me . How are we going to die ? Choking on your own blood . Could you be more specific ? We 're gonna line you up and shoot the lucky ones . The rest , like you , we 'll gut . [ FOUR ] No . That 's not it . You could have done that from the beginning . Stormed this facility , execute everyone in it . You have the men , the resources . But you didn 't . You hired us to do your dirty work instead . Plausible deniability . A mining colony wiped out by mercenaries . That 's unfortunate , but it 's not surprising . A mining colony wiped out by a Corporation . Well , that 's scandalous . - -We can make a deal- - - -You want the miners gone , without being directly implicated in their deaths . And you wouldn 't be here unless you had a plan to make that happen . If you let me go , I can guarantee your safety . [ SOLDIER ] I don 't know anything . You were neither briefed nor given orders ? Just transported down here to the planet and expected to improvise ? I can tell you from experience , torture doesn 't work . [ FOUR ] Torture is often ineffective , even counter-productive . On the other hand , I personally find it incredibly cathartic . Well , that could work . Of course it could work , right there . They plan to target your reactor . Trigger a blast that 'll level this entire facility . [ THOMAS ] It 's a Mark Four fusion reactor . Standard equipment for a mining community about 50 years ago . Nowadays , we can hardly find spare parts to keep it running . [ ONE ] It 's the perfect cover : outdated technology , ill-equipped miners who don 't know what they 're doing . It 's an accident waiting to happen . We 'll never be able to hold this position . Not for long , anyways . At least we 'll die fighting . [ ONE ] How we looking , Keeley ? [ KEELEY ] Clear skies . [ ONE ] Good . Keep us updated . What 's up ? Hey . I 've been thinking . [ THREE ] Yeah ? You 're right . [ THREE ] Which one of us ? Both of you . We 're doomed . [ THREE ] Nah , hang on a second . As much as I 'd love to tell you " I told you so , " I don 't know . Kinda like our chances here , guys . [ SIX ] It doesn 't matter how good our defenses are . By the end of the day , they got an endless supply of bodies and bullets . We don 't . Eventually , they 'll wear us down . Okay , and w-w-what was I right about ? There might be a way to win this , but it 's a long shot . Like you said , we 've got to hit them where it hurts most : their bottom line . Which is what we 're doing here . [ SIX ] No . Ferrous Corp. doesn 't care about their men . They 'll just get more . Ships , on the other hand , are a lot harder to come by , and a hell of a lot more expensive . You 're saying we take out their ship ? Yeah . Oh man . Well , I like the idea in theory , but it begs the question : How do we get it down here ? We don 't . We go up there after it . Or ... I do , anyway . In the Marauder . I 'll target their drive and that should do it . Set off a chain of secondary explosions that 'll rip that ship apart . And you with it . Maybe not . If I punch the Marauder 's engine and get clear of the blast radius- - [ ONE ] That 's crazy . They 'll take you down before you 're anywhere near them . Oh , they can try . No . We stand together and we die together . We can 't let you do this . What ? Hear the guy out . [ SIX ] I know you don 't like it . Believe me , I like it even less . We show we 're crazy enough to take out one of their ships , Ferrous Corp. will be less inclined to risk another one around here . Think about it . You know I 'm right . I regret that I didn 't have the opportunity to get to know you better . I think we could have been good friends . Bet you regret not teaching me how to fly that shuttle now , huh ? [ SIX , THREE laugh ] Do I ever . [ SIX chuckles ] Take care of them . You 're the only one on that ship with a lick of sense . If we help you , can you guarantee our safety ? It 's Bubba time . Who 's Bubba ? This is Bubba . What , you don 't name your guns ? No . Ah , well , this is Bubba , this is Lulu , other one 's Pip . What do you name the knife you keep in your boot ? I don 't name the knife in my boot . What do you think I am , psycho ? [ gun clicks ] [ MAN B ] Step away from the console . [ SIX ] Easy , friend . You were gonna leave us here to die , weren 't you ? No . I can save us all , if you let me . You 're a liar ! You and your friends can 't save us . [ SOLDIER ] Of course he can 't . I 'm the only one who can save you now . [ KEELEY ] This is Keeley , come in ! What 's happening out there ? [ KEELEY ] Two Ferrous Corp. shuttles just touched down ! He didn 't make it . [ KEELEY ] We 'll hold them back as long as we can ! Keeley , listen to me . If you 're in danger of being overrun , you need to fall back to the reactor room . Keeley ? ! [ gunfire ] Game on . [ gunfire ] Run ! [ FOUR ] Go ! Go ! [ SOLDIER B grunts ] [ THREE yells ] [ THREE grunts ] [ groans ] [ GIRL gasps ] No . Hey ! Hey ! Stand down ! Now ! Or I execute your friend ! [ growls ] What do you think ? I think he 's gonna kill him anyway . Yeah ... They 're powering weapons . Shields . They 've arrived . Deliverance , this is The Raza . I 'm in the company of two cruiser-class vessels under the flag of the Mikkei Combine . [ NIEMAN ] Raza , what the hell is this ? You 're outnumbered . Stand down or face the consequences . Blaze of glory ? Ah , what the hell ? One ... Two ... [ ALL yell ] [ SIX screams ] They 're gone . We did it . [ ONE ] We did it ! [ TWO ] Commander Nieman , allow me to introduce Commanders Sakey and Truffault of the MCS Sujin and Murakami . How dare you interject yourselves into a private dispute ? Well , it 's a good thing we did , for the sake of those poor miners . [ NIEMAN ] We were responding to an unprovoked attack- - [ SAKEY ] Irrelevant . That planet and its inhabitants now fall under the protectorate of the Mikkei Combine . Meaning you and your troops are in violation of Galactic Charter . This planet is an independent mining colony . Not anymore it 's not . We had a deal . I got a better offer . [ ONE ] I 'm sorry about Nassan . He was a good leader . I ... I don 't really know what we 're gonna do without him . Someone else will step up . Yeah . But you know , we could ... We could use some extra help . Look , I know it 's not glamorous , and I know it 's not like being among the stars , but ... Y 'know , there are some things down here that aren 't so bad . Yeah , I can see that . I just- - I think it 's nice to have a place where you know you belong . I know . For me , right now , I think that place is up on that ship . - - [ ONE sighs ] - - [ SIX ] Hey . Lets go . Good luck . You , too . I knew Ferrous Corp. wasn 't the only player in the galaxy . So after we jumped , I had the Android plot a course to the nearest Mikkei outpost . Once there , I took the liberty of making a deal on the miners ' behalf . How much is Mikkei paying ? Nothing . I gave them a 99 year lease for free . [ THREE scoffs ] [ SIX ] How the hell does that help the miners ? They 'll never agree to that . They already have . They 're signing the deal as we speak . See , their mistake was trying to negotiate with one combine . The only way to handle these bastards is to play them against each other . It 's a stalemate . The planet is worthless without the rights to the asteroid belt , and the asteroid belt 's worthless without the rights to the planet . [ TWO ] For the price of filing some legal papers , Mikkei gets to screw a major rival out of a big score . And if Ferrous ever caves and offers them some kind of revenue-sharing deal , the miners get 20 percent . I 'm sorry I didn 't get a chance to tell you before , but I couldn 't chance an intercept of ship-to-surface communication . Ah , we weren 't worried . I had a feeling you 'd come back for us . [ TWO ] Mm-hmm . [ FIVE ] Okay , so , um , what 's next ? [ TWO ] Well , the nearest space station is a couple of days out . We head there , refuel , resupply , and then decide . In the meanwhile , we can spend some quality time getting to know each other . Sweet . [ footsteps ] [ TWO knocks ] [ TWO ] Am I interrupting ? [ FIVE ] No . I 'm just drawing . [ TWO ] Can I ask you a question ? [ FIVE ] Sure . [ TWO ] Earlier today , you said someone was responsible for wiping our memories . [ FIVE ] Uh-huh . Why do you think that ? I-I don 't ... think , I know . How do you know ? I remember . Remember what , exactly ? [ FIVE ] Waking up in the middle of the night and uploading the program into the stasis core . [ FIVE ] Planting the virus while everyone else was sleeping . [ TWO ] You remember doing this ? [ FIVE ] No , not me . It was someone else . [ TWO ] Who ? [ THREE grunts ] [ FIVE ] It 's like I 'm remembering it for them . [ TWO ] And do you remember why this person wiped our memories ? Yeah . Because we 're dangerous .

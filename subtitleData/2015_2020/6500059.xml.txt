 Previously on Defiance ... This is our best chance to take Rahm by surprise . I don 't want him in there . It 's not your choice . I 'm going . - Just be careful . - Always . No ! No ! You gambled . If it had worked , you 'd be a hero . Yeah , but it didn 't . They trusted me , they followed me , and now they 're dead because of me . Rahm Tak is setting up camp right outside the stasis nets . I 've got an idea . It 's a suicide mission . I 'm offering you a chance at redemption . - Posthumously . - Ah ... there 's the catch . What are you still doing here ? Go . My body is yours . Agh ! The town of Defiance has been attacked by something monstrous . Hate . Hate drove the Votanis collective to collapse that tunnel , brutally murdering 27 brave heroes . Their faces are up here , memorialized on this wall . It 's a testament to our spirit that hate took us by surprise . And for our ignorance , we paid a very high price ... In blood . The blood of husbands and wives , sons ... And daughters . We owe them a debt we can never repay . Rahm Tak and his militia are dead thanks to the sacrifice made by Datak Tarr and the 27 brave soldiers who died bringing the fight to Rahm 's doorstep . I promise you these lights were not extinguished in vain . The Lawkeeper would like to say a few words . No ! I will not listen to the man who killed my son . - You butcher ! Things go wrong in war . I made a mistake . People died . I 'm sorry . I wish I could change that . But I can 't . I ... I ... I don 't have anything else to say . It 's okay . Alak . My condolences . Keep ' em . My mother ... you know where she is , don 't you ? I do not . But wherever she is , one may assume her heart grieves . Well , she 's a coward and a murderer . You do not understand the position she was in . You 're right . I don 't . If you do happen to see my mother , you could tell her that the Mayor may have pardoned her , but I haven 't . She comes anywhere near me or my son , I 'll kill her . I brought you some food from the market . I 'm afraid I don 't have much of an appetite . Hmm . Were you able to make contact with Alak ? He did not have kind words for you . As expected . Was he well ? Well enough to attend the funeral of your husband . There was a funeral ? Did Alak organize it ? No , the Mayor . I took the liberty of attending assuming that you 'd be anxious for details . Why would Amanda rosewater honor my husband ? He was hung as a traitor . Yet he was honored alongside those who fell fighting Rahm Tak . Datak walked that bomb into the Votanis camp . He martyred himself to save the town . Dying in the service of others is not the end I would have expected for my husband . It is possible he did it for you . How so ? Datak secured a pardon as a condition of his sacrifice . You are free to return home . Hmm . You okay ? That was Indur who walked out , Zero 's father . And that 's what 's left of Zero 's rifle ? What are you gonna do ? Figure his old man should have it . I 'll bring it to him . No , this one 's on me . You can 't think that 's a good idea . - I don 't . - Then why are you going ? 'Cause if this was yours , if that had been you burned to ash down in that tunnel and not Ender 's boy ... It 's what needs to be done . Indur ? Thought you should have this . My son used to make stew every Tuesday . Do you know what day today is ? I don 't want a broken rifle . I want my son . I want him sitting across from me at that table complaining about how his stew is never spicy enough . Can you give me that ? No , sir , I cannot . So how 's this gonna end ? Hey , this way . Where 's Nolan ? - Busy . - Is he okay ? He 'll be fine . What have you got ? Sanitation found the body this morning . Indogene victim . The stasis nets are down . Maybe a Sabre wolf wandered in through Bissel pass . A Sabre wolf wouldn 't break from the pack . This was something else . Doc ? Doc ! We got a body here . Ugh . Doc ! That 's weird . She 's usually open by now . Been memorizing my office hours ? Obviously you know me better than I know myself . Who 's the stiff ? Did my son ever tell you about Lucy ? Lucy ? I 'm afraid I didn 't have the privilege . I built it for him . He named it after a human girl who lived down the way . He was fond of her , but she was young and fickle and broke his heart . Zero used to say that this weapon was the second most beautiful thing he 'd ever seen . So he named it after the first . Ender , we all lose people we care about . What 's important in all of this is that you don 't lose yourself , not to the anger , not to the ache in your gut , not to the anything . I have nothing left to lose . And that 's all because of you . You 're right . I 'm just a grunt . I 'm not a General . I led ' em all down into that hole , and I got ' em all killed , your son included . And I 'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life , live with the memories of your boy . Is that the same speech you 're giving to all of the grieving ? No , you 're the only one I 've come to see . And why is that ? What makes my son so special to you ? I don 't know . Well ... Should I feel honored ? When it comes to your boy , without a doubt . When it comes to me ... How you feel about me , you , sir , are entitled to feel whatever way you want . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I 'm tired of talking anyway . Answer it . It might be important . Yeah , kiddo , I 'll be there as soon as I can . Go . I appreciate you making the effort . Keep your hands off my dead body . You said I could apprentice , so let me apprentice . I was joking . Did you not pick up on my withering sarcasm ? Oh , we 'll have to work out a signal for that . Think you knew him ? Or her ? Oh , I see . The stiff 's an Indogene , so of course we all know each other . Little bit of old-earth racism there , hey , doc ? When you were a vet , did you refuse to treat black cats as well ? You done ? For the moment . You seem to be pretty disturbed by this particular corpse . You don 't come across as someone that gets disturbed very easily . What are you , a pet psychiatrist too ? No , but I 'm thinking of opening a practice . Hmm . There 's something about the way the skin feels . I don 't like it . Doc , that 's you . How can the victim be you ? I have no idea . Ready to go hunting ? There was an animal attack last night . You identify the animal ? Not yet . What about the victim ? Doc and Samir are working on it . Given what I know about your people , what you have neglected to tell anyone else on this planet , how do you know I won 't betray you ? You always do what is in your best interest , and betraying me would not serve you well . There is that . I suppose it is your daughter , really , who should concern you . And why is that ? I believe she will betray you . Kindzi is under control . Where has she been these last few days ? Do you know ? I trust her . What will she do when you wake your people ? What will she tell them ? My family will follow me towards peace . But your daughter offers a different path . Your family will be forced to choose . Kindzi will obey me . Of course . You know her best . An auspicious homecoming . Favi ? Oh , you 're alive ! Oh , I was so worried . I 'm cleaning up this mess . Thank you , Andina . It 's good to be home . Lawkeeper . Kind of busy right now , T 'evgin . I assure you my business is as urgent as yours . Have you seen my daughter ? No . Is she missing ? She has an independent spirit . As a father , I find it ... vexing . I can relate . Why don 't you get upstairs , and see if you can find any tracks up top ? - On it . - Tracks ? What manner of animal would require that much firepower ? Wish I knew . You all right ? The scene is grizzly . Yeah , that it is . You know , if you have any insight at all into what kind of creature might have done all this damage , now would be a really good time to tell me . Nolan ! More blood up here . No tracks , but it looks like it kept eating as it headed east . Be right up there . You know , Defiance has had more than it 's ... - Tarr wife came back . - I heard . What 's the world coming to ? Terrorist gets to live in a big house , while we 're out here eating rat meat . That 's the goddamn Kwonyo Gyendo for you , huh ? Too true . What was that ? Hear that ? Come on . Hear that ? God damn it ! You can 't blame yourself . It 's a raccoon . Yeah , I see that . Take a couple of hours , get your head on straight . I 'll chirp you if I find anything . You saying I can 't do the job ? Maybe we should ask him ? Happy hunting . Oh . Have you seen much of Alak ? I bring him food and clean laundry twice a week . I do what I can to make him happy . How are his injuries ? Healing well . I wish he was home , though . The McCawley house frightens me . - Afraid of ghosts ? - No , afraid of death . I think that 's a very reasonable fear , don 't you ? I suppose so . Poor Alak . So kind . So sad . Don 't get me wrong . It 's beautiful the way he loved Christie . But the dead are dead . We must mourn them and move on . Moving on is rarely easy . Perhaps the next time you visit Alak , I will accompany you . Whatever you wish , Favi Stahma . What is it , Andina ? Out with it . Alak kept his gun from the militia . There are two bullets left inside , both meant for you ... One from Rafe , one from Christie . He keeps it by the front door . I would not recommend knocking . Thank you , for telling me . He 's been through a lot . Yes . We all have . You still have me , Favi . That I do , Andina . That I do . So who would clone you ? Smart money 's on the galaxy 's favorite puckered rectums , the Omec . Why ? Well , aside from me being the perfect gift for birthdays , anniversaries , and bar mitzvahs , the possibilities are endless and depressing . You know what 'd be weird ? Is if that 's you on the table , and you 're the clone . Or you 're both clones . Or ... - I 'm gonna stop talking now . - That might be best . Uh , why does your clone 's lungs have glitter in them ? They 're spores . Bagra spores . They only grow in old St. Louis . The Omec are hiding something from us . Where are you going ? I intend to shut those sons of bitches down . By yourself ? You know we should call Nolan and Amanda . Nolan and Amanda , right . The last time I asked those two to choose between the Omec and me , they tore a strip off my hide and used it for spare parts . Those two will pussyfoot around and give the purples a chance to destroy evidence . No , I 'm getting proof first . - Let me go with you . - No . Why not ? I can handle myself . If I 'm not back by this time tomorrow , I 'm counting on you to sound the alarm . Don 't you know it 's revolution ? I 'm right where I want to be Got to practice this day and night till we can do it blindfolded . I don 't care for no solution That 's it . Come on . Pick those legs up . I see what I want to see I 'm trying to get these people ready to fight a battle . Yes , I know it 's such a shock It has to be It 's our responsibility . It has to be There is some real talent here . And I can Feel that silver lining Come on . We have to get strong . And know the whole thing falls apart We will face the beast , and we will defeat him . And I can see This confederacy of the strong will hold the line with pride . We will face Rahm Tak , and we will defeat him . Do we have an understanding ? - Defiance ! - Defiance ! Defiance ! To just Turn to dust Turns to dust Don 't you know it 's revolution ? I 'm right where I want to be How 'd you get in here ? The door was open . Where 's your daughter ? Don 't know . Don 't care . That doesn 't sound right . What troubles you ? Too many dead people . You 're hurting . I can take that pain away . I don 't want it to go away . You should leave . I like it here . Wouldn 't you rather feel good , even if only for a moment ? No . You 're not the " feel good for a moment " type of guy , are you ? I think you like to take it slow , savor the moment . No . No . That growl , the beast , what do you know about that ? What aren 't you telling me ? Shouldn 't you answer that ? Doesn 't matter right now . What the hell 's going on ? Spoken like somebody who knows exactly what 's going on . - You 're drunk . - You ought to know . Well , at least I can drink and hold myself together . Clearly you can 't . Now get out of my way . I to go see T 'evgin . No . Why ? Why ? Why ? 'Cause him and Kindzi know something about these attacks , something they 're not telling us . All right , you 're going to go see T 'evgin like this ? Hmm ? Come on . Sit down . Okay . Shh . Shh . Hey . Hey , in the morning , I will go with you to the mines , and we 'll get to the bottom of this . How many more people have got to die ? I need you to sleep this off . All right ? For me . Please . Great . What could possibly go wrong here ? We created life . Doesn 't that make us gods ? Well , you won 't be getting a hosanna from me , purple . Funny . Your clones made jokes too ... At first . If you try to run , you 'll end up like them . If I don 't , you 'll kill me . Oh , I don 't want you dead . Oh , so I 'm misinterpreting the big pile of parts that looks just like me . I don 't care about you . I care about the hunt . Oh , well , there 's no sport in hunting my clones . I mean , come on . Look at this girl . She 's a lover , not a fighter . After years idle in deep space , I thought it best to start small . I 've begun to move on to more challenging prey . You 're going to help me hunt . - What is that ? - A control stem . It keeps you shape-takers docile . I won 't let you . - Yes , you will . - No , I mean it . You 'll have to kill me . No . Your will to live is much too strong . - Show me your neck . - No . If you don 't , I 'll snap it . Very good . Very good . Now pull the ax from your belt . What are you going to make me ... Remain silent . Please your empty hand on the ledge . Now raise the ax . Above the hand . Higher . Higher . Higher . Enough ! Come , shape-taker ! Go ahead . Explain . Remember when I used your drone to heal Nolan and Irisa ? Well , your sweet daughter here kept a copy of my source print and used it to make clones . - Dirty birdie . - Stop talking . Go back to town ; Tell no one of what you found here . Protect my interests at all costs . What were you thinking ? At least now I have your attention . - You are forbidden to feed . - Why ? Indogene were created for that very purpose . And what about the Votans in Defiance ? The ones you slaughtered ? - Lower races . - Sentient races . You know how intoxicating and disorienting the hunt can be . You never told me how great the hunger can be once you 've fed for the first time . Because I want more for you than that ! More than what we truly are ? Than what we are meant to be ? You have turned your back on our people . I will lead them into a new age , one without a harvest , one that will not end in our own extinction . I wonder what the others will think of you when they awake ? They will think I 'm a pragmatist . And then when you order them to lay in the filth beside the animals it is their right to feed upon ? We will not be denied our true nature . Yes ... you will ! And I am tired of teaching you . Good-bye , Kindzi . Nothing left for my baby More than I had to have But people say I should leave you I say I 'm trying my best Ooh Good day to you . I have entered a period of mourning and must apply Gwavo Ledawo . I require the darkest ink you have . Shop 's closed . Clearly it is not . You blew up the arch . That she did . Here . Pretend you 're selling to me . Thank you . For the pardon . Don 't thank me . Thank your husband . Oh , you can 't . He 's dead . For what it is worth , I regret the incident in your office . Not yet , you don 't . About last night ... All right . Get to talking , T 'evgin . What do you know about this beast ? There will be no more killings . Seems you could 've mentioned knowing about ' em when you walked into my crime scene or when your daughter took off running after the beast . There 'll be no more killings . - I got your word on that ? - You have my word . On your daughter 's life ? On my daughter 's life . Thank you , T 'evgin . No ! No , not good enough . I 'm gonna see justice for the people who 've died . The dead are dead , and nothing can change that . I have said all that I need to say . Nolan ! What are you doing ? He knows more than he 's letting on . Don 't you , T 'ev ? I will afford you one opportunity to pull that trigger . I recommend that you do not miss . You can see yourselves out . Come on . Did you find what you needed ? Went barking up the wrong tree . The victim was an Indogene but definitely not a clone . No , I saw the same results that you did . Well , I accidentally contaminated the DNA sample . What 's this thing on your neck ? Bling . Makes me feel girlish . No , what happened down in old St. Louis ? Did the Omec do something to you ? Yes , they did . Ohh ... I 'm sorry , Samir . Indur , you up ? Got your message . He was weak . You need to be strong , soldier . You hear me ? On your feet . On your feet .

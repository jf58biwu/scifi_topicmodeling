 And now it 's time for " the Captain America Adventure Program , " brought to you by Roxxon motor oil . Tonight 's thrilling tale takes us deep into the heart of the Ardennes Forest , where Hitler 's Nazi guard have ambushed the 107th Infantry and taken Betty Carver , the battalion 's beautiful triage nurse ... [ Train whistle blows ] As their hostage . You lousy krauts are in big trouble once Captain America gets here . When I 'm through with you , Hitler , you 're gonna be seeing stars ... and stripes ! [ Thumping ] Hitler : [ German accent ] Nein ! You will bow down to the fuhrer ! Here . Angie , would you mind changing that ? Oh , you bet . Arlene French beat me out for that part . [ Jazz music plays ] [ Clears throat ] " You lousy krauts are in big trouble once Captain America gets here . " It 's better , right ? Thrillingly realistic . ♪ Take a look at what I 've found ♪ You moving ? I ... uh , lost my roommate . [ Chuckles ] My first place , I lived with this girl from Queens . It was okay for maybe six months , and then ... Bam ! ... One day , she 's engaged . Next day , she 's married and living in Armonk . You think you know people . " Cozy studio apartment . " That means it 's a broom closet . " Convenient to public transportation " ... " You 'll be living under the Third Avenue el . " What would you suggest ? Girl down the hall from me just moved out . Couldn 't hack it , I guess . She was always crying to her mother on the hall phone . Oh , poor thing . Yeah , maybe the first couple times . Anyway , it 's over on 63rd . It 's real safe , lots of great girls . Plus , I 'd be your neighbor , so that 's not nothing . It 's a lovely idea , but I 'd hate for you to grow tired of me . You don 't strike me as the " crying on the hall phone " type , English . I appreciate it , truly , but , um [ Clears throat ] I 'm actually on my way to see an apartment now . At this hour ? You sure you 're reading the right kind of want ads ? It comes recommended through a friend . If you say so . [ Classical music plays ] Jarvis : You presumably already noticed the North German Renaissance influences , but the layout is decidedly French . Fresh fruit and scones served every morning . Ooh ! The chef likes a challenge , so you may order anything you like . - I can 't stay . - Mr. Stark insisted . He also wants me to clear his name on multiple charges of treason . If anyone finds out I 'm living in his house , I 'll be fitted for the noose . Well , if it puts you at your ease , this isn 't one of his primary residences . Mr. Stark uses this more for ... private entertaining . [ Muffled ] It 's too risky . Well , if you 're certain you wouldn 't like to see the master bedroom ... Ohhhh ! Russian sable , custom-made . Ohhhh . Perhaps one night . Splendid . Regarding our other matter , I checked through Mr. Stark 's files but found no mention of leviathan . I couldn 't find anything at the SSR , either . What about the two gentlemen with the unusual ... ? New York hospitals have no record of laryngotomy patients fitting those descriptions within the last three years . I think those quiet men are from out of town . Hmm . So , I 've got two foreign agents with no voice boxes fighting over a milk truck full of experimental implosives . Just another day at the office . Oh , I wish . The Daisy Clover Dairy opens at 5 : 00 . We need to find that milk truck . I 'll be standing by with a car at 10 to . You 've nearly been killed once , Mr. Jarvis . Others have been less fortunate . I think it 's best I should carry on alone . Oh . On occasion , Mr. Stark enjoys adding a theatrical element to his romantic endeavors . Is that what he calls it ? Oh ! Yes , this could prove useful . Oh , don 't be lewd . [ Static crackling ] _ _ _ [ Bell dings ] _ _ _ [ Static crackling ] _ _ _ [ Bell dings ] The maid arrives at 10 : 00 , the florist usually by noon . Cancel them both . And I shall ... cancel them both . Good night , Mr. Jarvis . [ Doorknob jostles ] I do wish you 'd change your mind and allow me to accompany you . I can be your second pair of eyes . I can 't imagine there being much danger at the dairy hub . I 'm only going to hunt a truck . Whoever drove that truck is a man that needs questioning . Good night . And how do you plan to find it ? I held on to the vita-ray detector from project rebirth . It should still pick up a reading from whatever truck was used to transport the nitramene . What ? It seems a tad conspicuous to walk into Daisy Clover and halt business to inspect for vita-radiation . I can assure you , I have far more tact than you give me credit ... Oh . Y-you 've popped a button . No . Good night , Mr. Jarvis . Well , what 's the worst that can happen ? [ Static crackling ] [ Bell dings ] [ Indistinct shouting in distance ] Man : Please ! I 'll tell you anything you want to know ! [ Breathing heavily ] I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . [ Groaning ] I swear to God ... I don 't know no Leet Brannis ! I-is it a person or a place ? [ Breathing heavily ] [ Static crackling ] [ Bell dings ] [ Grunts ] Oh , no . No , no , no . I told Spider I didn 't want anything to do with that stuff . It 's too hot , too pricy . I told him Gino Delucia out in Bensonhurst ... He 'd buy it . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Static crackling ] [ Bell dings ] [ Gasping ] [ Silenced gunshot ] [ Big-band music plays ] [ Knife rings ] - Man : Y 'all done there ? - Man ♪ 2 : Yeah . Man ♪ 3 : Ready to go ! Carter : [ American accent ] Excuse me ! Are you the foreman ? Who 's askin ' ? Ruth Barton , City of New York Health Department . You heard of that ? Yes . Well , you have not been acting like it . I 've had 15 complaints that you are under direct violation of City Health Provision 42 , Article 23 ... I.E. , the care and transport of all milkstuffs . - Complaints from who ? - Right now , me . I have a court order to inspect all delivery trucks in this distribution hub . Let 's hope I don 't find cheese where the milk 's supposed to be . Now , you gonna help me or hinder me ? Help ? Good answer . [ Sighs ] [ Bottles clank ] [ Indistinct shouting in distance ] [ Device whirring ] [ Buzzer ] [ Sighs ] There 's a truck missing . Well , we got a guy out sick the past two days . He uses his truck to commute . Has he never heard of a bus ? Name and address . Sheldon McFee , but I don 't got an address . Leave that to me . And put some air in that tire ! Thompson : Well , here 's what 's left of Roxxon . Dooley : Makes even less sense in the light of day . An entire chemical refinery squashed into that . I never seen anything like it . This is scary stuff , gentlemen ... The kind of technology that could give the a-bomb a run for its money . We need to find it fast . You think it 's magnets ? What ? You got steel fused with wood fused with iron fused with concrete . Last time I checked , stone and wood don 't carry a magnetic charge . Well , excuse me , Sir Isaac Newton . [ Chuckles ] That 's gravity , you dumb ape . Well , what do you think did it ? I think Howard Stark did it . [ Metal creaking ] Come on . We 're going to Roxxon . Nobody burns down your house by accident . Not you , Krzeminski . I got a special detail for a man with your skills . Grab a crowbar . Pull that thing apart . Find me some evidence . Krzeminski : Aw . You got to be kidding me . [ Indistinct conversations ] I see . Perfect . Yes . Yes . Thank you . Whitby 's prospect , third race . You sure ? Not at all . That 's why they call it gambling . I need to pop out for a minute ... Personal matters . Cover for me ? Sure thing , but you owe me one . Got that film developed for you . Hey , thanks a bunch . Photographer from the society pages was at Spider Raymond 's club . Says he may have got a shot of the blonde who was with spider before he got killed . [ Camera shutter clicks ] Well , that would be a big break . Can I help you look ? I thought you were leaving . Sousa ! Need you in the basement . I 'm busy . Well , now you 're extra busy . I got a 10-ton ball of Roxxon garbage with your name on it . All right , all right , give me a minute . Carter , finish up those transpo reports and file them for me . Car-ter ! Transpo reports . Get wiggling . Looks like I 'm gonna miss that race . It 's probably for the best . Man : Yeah , uh , we just got the briefing . Yeah , not just , like , 10 minutes ago . We got two agents ... [ Dial tone ] [ Buzzer ] [ Telephone rings , classical music plays ] Jarvis residence . I don 't have long , so listen very carefully . I need you to dispose of Howard 's car . I beg your pardon ? The SSR are looking into Roxxon at this very moment . That car sustained damage at the site and is likely to be teeming with vita-radiation . Make it disappear . [ Sighs ] Very well . [ Clears throat ] Let 's see . The linens come out of the wash in 30 minutes ... Now . Fine . I shall forego the linens . Did you locate the dairy truck ? Not yet , but I did locate the driver . Sheldon McFee uses the truck to commute from Cedar Grove , New Jersey . Shall we leave straightaway ? No . There 's something I need to take care of here first . Jones : You know , we used to be friends , Howard and I. Lunch at the club , Christmas parties , charity functions . To your very good health , gentlemen . It 's 10 : 45 in the morning . Ah . [ Clears throat ] So , what came between you and Stark ? My wife . Bit of a jump to go from that to industrial sabotage . Not the way he does it , from what I hear . So it 's personal , this attack ? It 's all the same with Howard , as long as he 's amused and making money . He attempted to purchase that refinery as recently as January , but I refused . Now it 's a smoking crater ... Not to mention a federal crime scene . You tell me ... who benefits ? Any idea what Stark may have used to cause this kind of damage ? [ Sighs ] What is your interest regarding minor legal transgressions not related to the red hook refinery ? Low . We 're not hunting you , Mr. Jones . I have sources working in Stark Industries , and they told me that Howard is working on a formula for molecular nitramene . Now , theoretically , it could result in a concussive blast followed by a vacuum implosion . Supposedly , it has its roots in his work with vita-radiation . Time-out . Vita-radiation ? [ Indistinct conversation ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Gasps ] [ Ringing continues ] [ Ringing stops ] [ Tumbler clicking ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Thud ] Oh ! Bloody hell . [ Ringing continues ] [ Breathing shakily ] [ Ringing continues ] Hello ? Sousa . Uh ... No , I don 't see her . Okay , okay . Well , I 'll keep an eye out ... Here she is . She 's right ... She 's right here . Chief wants a word . [ Clears throat ] Chief Dooley ? Just stepped away . Uh , vita-radiation ? Yes , I think we have something for that in the project rebirth file . I 'll see if I can find it . What was that about ? Oh , just another errand . [ Horn honks ] [ Door closes ] Carter . About time . Jones : Well . I didn 't know our government had such good taste in secretaries . What 's your name , darling ? " Agent . " [ Chuckles ] That has a lovely ring to it . As requested . I 'll meet you back at the office . What 's the rush ? Yeah , stick around . We could use your help . It wouldn 't be for filing , would it ? Turns out , anyone near the nitramene blast was exposed to vita-radiation , which is probably still somewhereabouts on their person . So we 're scanning everyone on Roxxon 's staff . There 's a chance this is an inside job . Yeah , there 's a chance I take Rita Hayworth home tonight , but it 's unlikely , if you catch my drift . If you got some of Stark 's guys in your pocket , there 's a chance he 's got some of your guys in his . And how am I to help ? How comfortable are you with this ? You 'll be dealing with the ladies . I volunteered , but chief said it wouldn 't be appropriate . [ Big-band music plays ] [ Chuckles ] [ Door opens , closes ] [ Device humming ] [ Device humming loudly ] [ Humming continues ] [ Device humming loudly ] [ Humming stops ] [ Humming resumes ] [ Humming stops , resumes , stops , resumes ] Oh . [ Click , humming stops ] [ Inhales sharply ] Sorry , Nana . [ Device humming ] You 're clear . [ Device humming ] Clear . Thank you . Next . Carter ? [ Device squeals ] Aah ! [ Snaps fingers ] Carter ! [ Device humming ] You 're clear . Wai ... Uh , hold on a moment , sir . Excuse me . Sir ? Mr. Jones , I notice these men are wearing company-issued uniforms . Do they change their clothes onsite ? Well , we have a locker room for all the technicians who handle hazardous materials . What 's your point , Carter ? Well , low-level vita-radiation would barely saturate the top layer of a person 's skin . A hot shower would wash it out straightaway . But clothing would remain tainted for longer ... Trousers , shoes , even a wristwatch . I suggest we check the clothes the men wore to work this morning . Not a bad idea . We can ... Hey ! Hey ! Stop ! Where does that lead ? Down to the front lobby . Stairwell ? May I ? Thompson : I said stop ! [ Panting ] Can I be of any further assistance ? [ Handcuffs click ] [ Sighs ] I 'm not gonna lie to you ... You 're in a bad spot . We have physical evidence linking you to an act of industrial sabotage and probably treason . With the type of charges being tossed around here , I can 't see you winding up anywhere besides the electric chair . Of course ... You still do have the opportunity to switch seats with someone else . You see , fighting crime is a lot like fishing with your buddies ... Biggest fish wins . No offense , but you 're not the biggest fish . Doesn 't mean you 're not plenty big enough for me to feed my bosses , but if you were to help me catch a bigger fish ... Say , a grouper or a shark ... I could see myself letting you off the line . I don 't believe you . Well , you should . I 'm in law enforcement . Thing is , Mr. Van Ert , we 're under a bit of an accelerated timeframe here ... Lot of pressure to get this case sewn up . So this deal that I 'm offering you will expire ... as soon as I leave the room . All you have to do is point us in the direction of your employer . Just ... give me ... a name . Just give me a name . Don 't say I didn 't try to do this the easy way . [ Breathes deeply ] [ Clears throat ] [ Sniffs ] You can threaten me all you want , but I 'm not talking . I 'm not here to make you talk , Miles . [ Sniffs ] [ Clears throat ] I 'm here to make you sing . You 're gonna want to bite down . [ Breathing shakily ] [ Grunting ] Hate to see what would 've happened if you 'd left the carrot . Carter , take off for the night . A lady shouldn 't be seeing this . You boys play nice . Talk . ♪ Bum , bum , ba bum ♪ ♪ bum , bum , ba bum ♪ Oh , come on , Mr. Jarvis . A penguin could get here faster . [ Knock on window ] Angie : [ Muffled ] I found one ! I 'm late for my appointment ! It has its own bathroom . I ... I 've no idea what you 're saying . Don 't make me come out there . Angie , I really must ... " Women only . " A safe community for modern female professionals . " Apartment for rent . " 550 square feet , furnished , full bath , " high floors , quiet building , security assured . " Close proximity to the Lexington Avenue local . Continental breakfast upon request . " Paradise or what ? That sounds perfect . That 's because it is . The only thing that could possibly make it better is if you lived next to me . Oops ! You would . 3C if you need a cup of sugar . I really shouldn 't , Angie . Am I missing something here ? You need a place , this one is great , so ... I 'm thinking maybe it 's me . I 'm afraid I wouldn 't make a very good neighbor . [ Horn honks ] Oh . That 's my ride . I 'll see you later . Too late ! [ Car door closes ] [ Engine turns over ] Miss Carter . Mr. Jarvis . [ Fanfare ] Meanwhile , in the snowy mountains of the Eastern Alps , battalion triage nurse Betty Carver tidies up while the men defend their country . What a beautiful day to mend these pants . And my new singer featherweight 221 sewing machine makes stitching so easy . [ Thud ] Oh , no . Nazis ! Again ! They 've got me all tied up ! If only Captain America were here to rescue me . Who writes this rubbish ? [ Click ] I rather enjoy it , actually . Although , the ... the real thing is considerably more impressive . Are you trying to butter me up , Mr. Jarvis ? Merely pleased to receive your call . Well , you are faster than a train . How flattering . It 's very nice . You did dispose of the old car ? I left it in hoboken with the keys in the ignition . I don 't imagine it 's still there . It did seem a terrible waste , though . It was used in the commission of a crime . One doesn 't park that sort of thing in a garage . Cedar Grove . Aptly named . You might hurry . We don 't have much time . I 'm afraid agent Thompson can be rather persuasive . We 're gonna need a new stick . Immigration has no record of a " Leet Brannis " ever entering the country . Could be an alias . If it is , our friend in there doesn 't know it . He wasn 't holding anything back . We get anything on the milk-truck driver ? I 'm on hold with Daisy Clover payroll . He didn 't sound like he was the brains of the operation , anyway . More like the Krzeminski of the operation . Joke 's on you , peg leg . I don 't even know how to drive a truck . Driver may be a lead , but this guy Brannis is the key . Sorry , chief . I pressed Van Ert pretty hard in there on Howard Stark . I don 't think he ever met him . Doesn 't mean anything . Stark could have go-betweens between his go-betweens . If this guy Brannis is calling the shots on this deal , I 'm telling you , he 's our direct link to Stark . I got the milk-truck driver . Sheldon McFee , 4 Springhill Road , Cedar Grove , New Jersey . Hot damn . Let 's go , boys . [ Knife rings ] [ Bell dings ] Carter : Down the road . Pull up by the side . [ Dog barks in distance ] [ Sighs ] And here we are again . Fewer guards than Roxxon , at least . Shall I leave the engine running in case you trigger another implosion ? Mr. Jarvis , go home to your wife . If you leave now , you may even catch the end of Benny Goodman . Miss Carter , when you called me , I assumed it was because you needed more than a cab . I thought I proved rather useful last time . I agree , but on this occasion ... I 've got my own ride home . [ Radio tuning ] [ Fanfare ] Announcer : We now return to " the Captain America Adventure Program , " in which our hero 's defenseless sweetheart finds herself in the clutches of evil . Nazi : American women are so weak ! You are coming with us ! Carver : If only Captain America were here to rescue me . [ Floorboard creaks ] Captain America : Miss Carver isn 't going anywhere with you , Nazi scum . Seize him ! Unhand her ! [ Thumping ] Hit him again , cap ! [ Both grunting ] [ Rattling ] Had enough yet ? [ Crack ] [ Clatter ] Are you all right , Miss Carver ? Is that all you 've got ? Hello ? Mr. McFee ? Captain America , what would I ever do without you ? Why does this keep happening ? It 's so hard getting straight answers out of people nowadays . Whatever happened to a nice cup of tea and a civilized interrogation ? [ Door creaks ] [ Engine sputtering ] Get out . Car trouble ? Nothing that can 't be fixed . What the hell are you doing here ? Mr. Stark asked me to help you , and so I have . I sabotaged the motor . Move , and I shoot . I thought you 'd be more impressed . Well , I 'm not . I told you I don 't need your help . An ideal butler provides service without being asked . [ Scoffs ] Put it back . I need to drive this thing of here . [ Sighs ] Won 't be a moment . Where are Stark 's inventions ? [ Scoffs ] [ Click , speech synthesizer hums ] I want protection . The SSR will take you in , provided that you say something interesting right bloody now . Psst ! Ask him about Leviathan . Who is Leviathan ? Not who ... what . Your employers ? Not anymore . So Leviathan sent you to rob Howard Stark 's vault ? And you double-crossed them ? Well , that seems incredibly brave or incredibly stupid . Leviathan only wanted one thing from Howard Stark . All finished . Well , fetch Mr. McFee . I need to take him in , too . What was the one thing ? What was Leviathan after ? I want ... protection . Then start ... talking . [ Door closes ] [ Breathing heavily ] Uh , bit of a snag , actually . I 'm afraid Mr. McFee 's left the premises . I did find this . Mm . Don 't shoot yourself in the face . Get in the truck . Comfortable back there , Mr. Jarvis ? Perfectly , thank you . These racks of explosives have distracted me from the smell of stale milk . Oh , good . You did say you wanted to help . Take the Lincoln Tunnel back to Manhattan . And stop fidgeting . Nothing 's going to happen . [ Thud ] Did either of you hear that ? [ Silenced gunshot , bullet ricochets ] Well , I definitely heard that ! Shake him loose ! [ Engine revs ] Aah ! Shoot up ! ♪ He 's a mellow fellow ♪ Chief . ♪ He always plays the rhythm , so we call him the swing man ♪ Well , that 's suspicious . ♪ He really loves his music ♪ [ Panting ] ♪ Busy as a bee ♪ ♪ and when he starts a-muggin ' , you just shout " mercy me " ♪ ♪ The whole darn world goes ma when he starts ♪ ♪ and he 's a killer-diller ♪ ♪ Never missed a beat , he 'll swing you out your seat ♪ Evenin ' . ♪ There 's a reason why ♪ [ Grunts ] Pull over ! If you do not pull over this instant , I will have no choice but to shoot you ! [ Gasps ] For God 's sake , will you please stop shooting things ? ! [ Tires screech ] Oh ! [ Gasps ] [ High-pitched whining ] Do I even need to ask ? Ask what ? Yeah , I guess you 're right . I used to strap a chair to my ass and take long walks around the neighborhood , too . We know who you are , Mr. McFee . We were on our way to pay you a visit . So , who did this to you ? Was it Leet Brannis ? We know he paid you off to use the truck . You 're in deep water . I 'd take that life preserver , if I was you . You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . We 'll keep an open mind . [ Whining continues ] Miss Carter ! I hear it ! Get Brannis ! Jump clear ! What ? ! [ Grunting ] This is where I get off . [ Grunting ] Aah ! [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] What the hell is that ? Thompson , step on it . [ Panting ] Jarvis : Are you all right ? I 'm fine . You ? Yes , I ... I 'm afraid Mr. Brannis broke my fall . The rest of the weapons that you stole from Howard ... I need to find out where you hid them . You 're the only one who knows . I need to find those weapons before ... Leviathan is coming . Help me stop them . [ Wheezing ] What is that ? M-Mr . Brannis , what is that ... a heart ? [ Groans ] Mr. Brannis ... [ Siren wailing in distance ] Where is the car ? It 's that way . I think we should retrieve it immediately . Miss Carter , please . Allow me . [ Siren continues ] I used to come skinny-dipping here as a kid . That 's a sight . Somebody knows what we know before we know it , and it 's really starting to chap my ass . We can pick you up some baby powder for you on the way back . Maybe that 'll help . We got footprints ... A woman 's . She was with him till he died . Or up until she popped him herself . Got to be the broad who cuffed fatty to his chair . Could be that blonde at the nightclub . - We ever get a look at her ? - Pictures were Sousa 's detail . What the hell is he doing ? Sousa . What the hell are you doing ? [ Horn honks ] [ Inhales sharply ] You 're quite good at that . Yes , Mr. Stark 's zippers are under considerable strain . You 're very fortunate , you know . He missed the bone by 3 inches . That 's not what I meant . Then look me in the eye and say what you meant . You 're very fortunate that I ignored your instructions . Oh , you 're so right . How I managed to stay alive before I met you , I have no idea . I can 't tell if you 're being arrogant or ignorant . Both , I imagine . Your line of work requires support ... People who care about your well-being , who 'll be there to stitch up your wounds . If I allow people to get close to me , I 'm putting them in danger . So your solution is to remove yourself from the world you wish to protect ? Where 's the sense in that ? There is not a man or woman , no matter how fit he or she may be , who is capable of carrying the entire world on their shoulders . Steve was . From what Mr. Stark has told me , Captain Rogers relied heavily on you ... For courage , strategy , and moral guidance . You were his support . Your desire to help others is noble . But I doubt you 'll find much success unless you allow others to help you . [ Breathes deeply ] As you were . [ Sighs ] [ Inhales sharply ] [ Big-band music plays ] - Hi , Mary . - Hi . That 's Mary ... She 's a legal secretary at Goodman , Kurtzberg , and Holliway . - Evelyn . - Evelyn : Hey , Angie . Evelyn is a lounge singer at a club in midtown . - Hi , Sarah . - Hi . That 's Sarah . She 's a slut . I am so happy you changed your mind . You 're gonna love living here . Assuming I 'm accepted . I 've never rented a flat that required an interview . It 's just a formality . You 'll ace it . Miriam 's a total pussycat . [ Ballad plays ] Your references are impeccable . Senator Palmer is especially complimentary . He and my father were dear friends . Were you limping as you came in ? Caught my heel on a cobblestone . You know how the west village is . I never travel below 23rd street , so no , I do not . How long do you see yourself working for the telephone company ? Only until I 'm married , Miss Fry . [ Inhales sharply ] In a city filled with temptation , debauchery , and mischief , the Griffith Hotel is a haven for proper young ladies . Our code of conduct is indisputable . Attire should be demure and elegant . Curfew is 10 : 00 . No drinking . No men above the first floor . No exceptions . Is that clear , Miss Carter ? Perfectly . [ Chuckles softly ] Dooley : That is it . Show him , Sousa . Right there . - We 're right . Show that other photo . - Not even close . That right there ... That 's the angle . Don 't back off , okay ? I 'm telling you . Carter , come here for a second . Come here , come here , come here . [ Clears throat ] Settle a bet for us . Is that Joe DiMaggio ? I don 't follow boxing . [ Laughing ] Aww ! Krzeminski : I told you she wouldn 't know who DiMaggio was . I still say it 's him . Believe me , I think I 'd know if I was in the same room as Joe DiMaggio . How do you figure ? I would sense his presence . Ah , get outta here . You bet against me ? How could you be sure ? I wasn 't . That 's why they call it gambling . [ Chuckles ] Did you , um , spot anyone else ? Nothing definitive , but we got a couple shots of the blonde . She really knows how to duck a camera . Not one clear shot of her face . Tough break . Nobody 's lucky forever . I 'll find her . Mm . [ Fanfare ] Once again , the powers of freedom and democracy prevail . I 'm so lucky to have a man as brave and strong as Captain America . Nazi : Not so fast , Captain America . I still have a few tricks up my sleeve . You 'll never be able to defeat my secret weapon . What on earth could that be ? Announcer : And that concludes tonight 's episode of " the Captain America Adventure Program " ! Be sure to tune in next week for another thrilling tale ... Dooley : You find something , Krzeminski ? Yeah . Think I found something big .

 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... S.H.I.E.L.D. still needs a face . Keep the title , but when it comes to operations , I 'm calling the shots . Radcliffe : We were so close . Aida 2.0 : Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand . And all the answers it holds . Though poor Fitz ... We could just reboot the head ... in a controlled environment ... and then we could diagnose the problem together . Please ! Drop it . I 'm gonna figure out what broke you . [ Electronic voice ] Thank you , Fitz . Will there be another opportunity to acquire the Darkhold ? Agent May 's decoy will be more convincing . Her programming operates on a subconscious level . If Agent May isn 't aware of her mission to retrieve the Darkhold , then she won 't be able to reveal herself . She 'll instinctively climb the ranks , gain access , and get closer to Agent Coulson , the man who knows just where this book is . [ Exhales sharply ] 4x11 - Wake Up _ Coulson : Sorry . Didn 't think you 'd get stuck on a milk run to Radcliffe 's . We 're gonna miss you in the field . I 'll catch up . Can 't let you have all the fun . When this is over , it 's time . We are cracking that bottle . You don 't have to twist my arm . I wouldn 't dare . You might whip my ass . Agent May . Director Mace ... he ... he knows that Aida is ... what Aida is ? - Yeah . He knows . - I wish I 'd been there to explain . [ Sighs deeply ] H-How did he take it ? He wants to use her on this , but concerned . " Concerned . " That 's not a happy word . - Did ... Did he say if ... - He wants to talk , has questions . I don 't like those words , either . [ Chuckles dryly ] I hear you 're on your way to personally escort Aida . Why ? Well , no one knows what she can do . - And she saw the Darkhold . - Well , I could help with that . Once I 've studied it , I-I 'd be able to determine ... No . No . No one 's touching it . When this is over , I 'm destroying the book myself . Because it 's dangerous , yeah . I-I-I understand . You still need access to my apartment . - Maybe I could , uh ... - No , that 's never been a problem for me . [ Chuckles ] Right , right , right . Well , I 'll reach out to Aida , anyway , tell her to expect you . Be ready to help solve the current ... problem . - Sure . - Okay . [ Music ] [ Beeps ] Aida , I want you to access your information cache . Locate the Sunset Protocol . I have it , Doctor . Activate it . [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Doorbell rings , door opens ] Aida 2.0 : Hello , Agent May . I 've been expecting you . Dr. Radcliffe gave me specific instructions . Happy to help . Allow me to retrieve the neural-assessment gauge . What 's a neural-assessment gauge ? Ohh . [ Exhales sharply ] [ Music ] - I apologize , Agent May . - Unh ! [ Music ] [ Device beeps , whirs ] [ Computer beeping ] Let 's get you up to speed , shall we ? [ Tablet beeps ] - What 's a neural-assessment gauge ? - Right this way . [ Music ] _ [ Wind chimes dinging ] [ Door closes ] Hope you liked your facial , Melinda . It 's time for your massage . Ready ? I don 't remember coming here . You dozed off . Obviously , you 're very relaxed . That 's good . Yeah , I don 't think I have time for this . Thanks . [ Wind chimes ding ] [ Door opens , closes ] Hope you liked your massage , Melinda . It 's time for your facial . Look , I-I don 't think I want this . I don 't want to be here . [ Wind chime dings ] [ Door opens , closes ] Hope you liked your facial , Melinda . No . [ Gasps , breathing heavily ] [ Monitors beeping , alarm blaring ] [ Grunting ] [ Coughs ] [ Choking ] Radcliffe : Aida , no ! [ Strained ] I knew it wasn 't real . The syringe , Aida . You have to sedate her . [ Coughing weakly ] You bastard . We may have misjudged what it takes [ Echoing ] to keep Agent May comfortable . _ [ Monitor beeping ] Radcliffe : Heart rate normal , vitals stable . Seems to be working . - You found the solution , Doctor . - Mm . Well , for now , yes . Just not a permanent fix . However , as long as our May replacement at the S.H.I.E.L.D. base does her job , it doesn 't have to be . Question ... why does it matter if the original May is dead or alive ? - Aida ? - It doesn 't make logical sense . We have cerebral replication . We have physical replication . No one in S.H.I.E.L.D. knows she 's been replaced . - What empirical difference is there ? - Well , for one thing , the Framework is in beta testing . We need May alive for calibration ... - Yes , but I ... - But , also , we 're not killers . Nathanson was a drastic overadjustment . But isn 't it preferable to sacrifice one life to save millions ? Yes , as a last resort , Aida . But I hope that May won 't give us any kind of problem at all , and we don 't have to face ... sacrificing her . Our May Life Model Decoy should get us the Darkhold eventually . And if something goes wrong ... then we have our safety net . You 're referring to the other android - now in operation . - Yes . Our second LMD . [ Music ] Coulson : We have to show the world who she really is . Talbot : And it 's well past time . Daisy now represents S.H.I.E.L.D. - Everything has to be aboveboard . - But marching into the Capitol Building so Daisy can sign the Sokovia Accords ? Senator Nadeer will be there . It seems risky . We 're all aware of the dangers , some of us more than others . I 'm fine with it , Jemma . Are you ? It doesn 't seem like you . And , Coulson , you 're letting her . That ... It doesn 't seem like you , either . With Nadeer and her staff in the meeting , - we have an opportunity . - Talbot : What opportunity ? I wasn 't briefed on any opportunity . While Nadeer 's in with Daisy , Yo-Yo and I will get into her office and plant surveillance . Daisy : We can finally keep an eye on her , - figure out her next move . - What ? No . No . No , there 'll be no planting , no eyeing , no Yo-Yo-ing . S.H.I.E.L.D. is now legitimate . We have to remain above reproach . You mean like juicing our Director so he can pretend to be Inhuman ? Look , you are reacting to the situation we had . You put Jeffrey in place , I understand , but we 're S.H.I.E.L.D. We have to be proactive . This is politics , Phil , which means politicians . They are a festering cesspool of toxic-waste fires . You swim in those waters , you could get pulled under . You and the Director can handle it . We 'll handle the rest . May , you with us ? Always . [ Monitors beeping ] Hmm . She 's stabilized now . As I said , no reason to even consider harming Agent May . Very good , Doctor . [ Glass shatters ] Oh , dear . Not again . [ Music ] [ Glass scratching ] [ Breathes deeply ] [ Chuckles ] I 'm happy Turtleman came out to play this morning . You . You 're Turtleman . - It 's not a nickname for your ... - Okay , I get it . I get it . - We could find a nickname for it ... - No , I 'm good . ... but ... okay . [ Chuckles ] Me too . I enjoy you . - Yeah ? - Mm-hmm . I mean , sure , you 're an engineer , and you 're smart , and ... your insides are great . But this outside , these arms ... - they don 't even seem real . - Oh . You 're not so bad yourself . - Not bad ? - Mnh . [ Smacks lips ] I 'm a knockout . And I 'm thirsty . [ Chuckles ] - Want some water ? - No , I 'm good . [ Cellphone vibrates ] [ Sighs ] [ Music ] [ Clothing rustles ] Oh , is it time for the mission already ? Uh , no , it 's a change of plans . I ... I 'm not gonna be on this one . I was just covering the communications here , anyway . I , uh ... I got to do something ... else . Is that the text you just got ? Yeah . It 's just a change of plans . It 's , uh ... [ Bag thuds ] Look . I 'm sorry . I know it 's bad timing , but you guys are gonna be fine . Okay ? I 'm gonna catch up with you when you get back . - Okay . - Okay ? [ Music ] - May2 : Fitz . - May . You need something ? Answers about Aida . Security report on the incident , need to close it out . Okay . What do you need to know ? How much was Aida aware of what she was going to do before she did it ? Could she have stopped it ? This isn 't about a security report , is it ? It 's about you . About ordering Aida to read the Darkhold . Trust me , I was trying to get her to do the same thing , and I 'm asking the same questions that you are . I think you did what you had to do in the moment . It was a hard choice . Not when it comes to saving you and Coulson . No . That 's just how you 're built . [ Breathing heavily ] Aah ! Aah . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Footsteps approaching ] Radcliffe : Aida ? I need to go out for a bit . There 's a situation to which I must attend . - Shall I drive you ? - No . Shouldn 't take long . Doctor , if Agent May does become a problem ... Oh , I don 't see that happening . [ Door closes ] Gentlemen , Agent Mackenzie requested personal time , so he 's not with us on this . Mack or no Mack , I 'm urging you to reconsider the second part of this mission . Which part is the second part again ? - The stupid part . - Ah . Nadeer 's office . If she discovers you 've launched an unauthorized investigation into her , it 's gonna trigger an investigation into you . There are always consequences . It 's dangerous , but she is dangerous . And this is our chance to get ahead of it proactively . - Gentlemen , I 'm sure we ... - Keep calling me reactive , Phil . Half the time , I 'm reacting to the steaming pile of fart-pebbles you hand me . And the other half , you 're not giving me the full story . - We 're like the odd couple here . - Gentlemen , we have a mission . At the very least , we need a contingency plan . If she comes after you , she 's gonna want S.H.I.E.L.D. records , S.H.I.E.L.D. assets . Let me take them to a military facility for protection . That makes no sense . Our people are trained to protect those assets . Until she deposes all of you . General , the assets belong here . And for the record , Nadeer tried to kill several people , including me . Coulson is right . We need to get ahead of her . Yeah , but you have to say that , don 't you ? Excuse me . [ Music ] [ Grunts ] Aah . [ Electricity crackles ] Perhaps you are gonna be a problem after all . Hyah ! [ Lamp shatters ] [ Crash ] [ Thud ] I like you , Agent May . I don 't wish for you to suffer . I promise to make this quick and painless . Thanks . I 'm not worried . [ Electricity crackles ] [ Music ] How 're you holding up ? It 's okay to be nervous , you know . Me ? Nah . I don 't get nervous anymore . Okay . Well , I 'm just saying , if you are ... I mean , it 's not my comfort zone , but I 'm good . I 'll just tell the truth . I 'm good at that . You ? You don 't talk much about your childhood , do you ? The foster homes , bouncing around . I imagine a lot of the time , it felt like you had to perform to convince people to like you . Only the places I wanted to stay . Why are you asking ? Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance , eventually everything becomes a performance . And believe me , I know how it feels putting on an act full-time . Yeah . You do , don 't you ? Anyway , I know it 's not an act with you . Coulson 's been saying since day one that you 're the real deal , and I 've learned to trust his read on people , so ... He believed in me before I believed in myself . You too , you know . It 's why he wants you with us still . He ... He keeps saying you were trying to do the right thing . - Oh , you 've talked about it , huh ? - Sure . And listen , with me ... sometimes it 's ... Sometimes I think it 's an act . You got this . - Jeffrey , I 'm surprised to see you . - Yeah , I 'm sure you are . Surprised to see him not dead , you mean ? There 'll be plenty of time to ask questions after we 've started , Ellen . I expect a lot of questions will be answered in this meeting . Have fun . Great . What does that even mean ? I think we 're gonna find out . [ Sighs ] Man : All right , let 's bring the meeting to order . Agent Daisy Johnson , we 'd like to swear you in . [ Camera shutters clicking ] - [ Beeps ] You 're clear , go in . - Thank you . [ Beeps ] - That went well . - Fitz is an artist . So , Mack ... personal time , huh ? Don 't put me in the middle of this . What middle ? No middle . But you know something . It 's not for me to say . Mack 's a very private person . All I know about him is what 's in his file . I spent six months on a plane with the guy . I bet I know less than you . So maybe something 's on his file . Maybe you should ask him . [ Speaking Spanish ] Well , I don 't know about annoying him , but you 're starting to annoy me . [ Chuckles ] Isn 't it better to learn things organically instead of all at once in a report ? No , all at once . Much better . Private person , secrets ? Same thing . Must be even tougher with May . If it 's better to get to know each other - in tiny , slow , annoying pieces ... - I don 't think that 's how I put it . ... then you two will never get together . Me and May ? - No . It 's not like that . - [ Chuckles ] Please . I don 't need to read a file on you two to know . You know , no one likes a smart-ass . That hasn 't been my experience . _ [ Door opens ] - You and May ready for the op ? - Yeah , we 've got it covered . Uh , we could always use a fresh pair of eyes if you 'd like to join us . Yeah , no . I 've ... stuff to do here . Okay . You know , one of the upsides of having a girlfriend is you get to talk about what 's bothering you . Yeah , well , doesn 't really sound like an upside for the girlfriend . I know you 're upset about Aida . I 'm in a strange position . I don 't want to intrude on you while you 're ... processing . But I also want you to know you can talk to me . - Always . - Yeah , I know . Just , uh ... You know I go all quiet when I 'm ... processing . Okay . [ Door closes ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Music ] Daisy : No , Senator , I understand . Being a party to the Sokovia Accords would be very different from being an undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Well , you 'll answer to a different authority ... the public . Believe me , I 've ... I 've had worse bosses . [ Light laughter ] - Uh , next up is Senator Nadeer . - Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . Agent Johnson , as an Inhuman yourself , do you feel more responsibility to help Inhumans than normal Americans ? Well , first of all , Inhumans are normal . Let 's be clear about that . But with regard to whom I 'll help , I 'm here for all Americans . But more often than not , Inhumans are left to fend for themselves with few resources . - So Inhumans cause more trouble . - No . Inhumans are more likely the victims of hate crimes , which is not fair . They are our friends , they are our co-workers ... our brothers . They all deserve help , wherever they may be . [ Camera shutter clicks ] Agent Johnson , let 's discuss your theft of more than $ 7 million from three banks while you were undercover from S.H.I.E.L.D. Illegally acquired funds going towards illegal activity . So you say . Has the U.S. government recovered those funds ? The money has been distributed to ... - worthy causes . - I see . So you took the entire justice system into your own hands . Coulson : We 're in position . Simmons : Place them around the room , and they 'll give us geometric scans . [ Music ] Coulson . Security officers approaching the location . Hold . Okay , they 're moving past . We 're good . - I was working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative ... - Without signing the Accords , so either you committed an illegal act by robbing banks or S.H.I.E.L.D. committed an illegal act by using an unauthorized enhanced agent . Mr. Chairman , this line of questioning ... And S.H.I.E.L.D. is still doing it . Coulson : Transmitting images now . Hold on . What the hell just happened ? What 's this ? [ Beeping ] [ Whining ] Freeze ! Stay right there ! - That 's her , the fast one . - Leg cuffs go on her . - Radio it in . - Even as we speak , S.H.I.E.L.D. continues to engage in illegal activity . That 's not true . - No ? - No ! General , moments ago , my people apprehended two S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives breaking in to my office . Seems they were trying to install surveillance equipment to spy on my staff and me . Uh , there ... there must be some mistake here . This Inhuman , Ms. Rodriguez ? She signed the Sokovia Accords , but now she 's been caught red-handed in a S.H.I.E.L.D.-sanctioned operation without U.N. approval , just as S.H.I.E.L.D. did with Agent Johnson . It appears S.H.I.E.L.D. really is a criminal organization after all . [ Music ] [ Sighs ] That conversation does not look fun . I have a feeling no conversation with that woman is ever fun . She knew we 'd be there . Not just any Inhuman . You specifically . There has to be a leak . [ Indistinct conversation ] Yeah . There has to be . [ Door opens ] Well , we 're all free to go . Because there 's a catch , right ? - Well , maybe a slight ... - You 're damn right there 's a catch . There 's gonna be a full investigation , starting with a Senate committee hearing . They may even bring charges . That 's unlikely , so let 's all just take a beat ... Unlikely ? They 're gonna drag us in front of every subcommittee , asking us who we are and what we do . This was the risk in going legit . No , this was the risk in going after Nadeer . Couldn 't have known she 'd be ready for us . Maybe if somebody had warned you first ? - Guys . - No , you do this all the time , Phil . I give you the benefit of my expertise , and you just ignore it . You 're never up front with us , General . You lied about Taiwan , you lied to us about Jeffrey ... They kidnapped my son ! And I put Jeffrey in that position because you have too damn much baggage to hold that position yourself . We have very different styles . We always have . And your style just gave the bad guy all the ammunition she needs to go after us . - That 's not how I see it . - Really ? How do you see it ? This move just exposed the fact that we have a leak . Someone tipped Nadeer off we were coming . You opposed the op . Did you warn her ? I believed in you when no one else did , Phil . No . I am not the leak . S.H.I.E.L.D. only exists because of me . And maybe that 's a mistake . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Music ] [ Door handle rattles ] Hello , Agent May . [ Music ] Time to give this up , please . No . You 'll have to kill me . Very well . But know that it will not make me happy . - Oh , no . - Hello , Agent May . Congratulations . You got further this time than your previous attempts at this course . - What is this ? - We call it the Framework . Your journey to escape Dr. Radcliffe 's lab , our fight , all of this ... it 's a simulation . I assure you , you 're safe . We 've moved you to another location . You put this in my head . Dr. Radcliffe knew the best way to keep you busy was to give you something to fight . - Something like you . - Yes , but this is the program 's end . We 're coding more , but we can 't keep up with you . You keep getting through it faster . I 'll wipe your memory and send you through again . You wipe my memory , but I get better every time ? Yes . Memory traces . So I 'm beating it . And I 'll get out eventually ... beat you . In 3 , 2 , 1 ... Oh , dear . Not again . [ Monitor beeping ] We don 't know what 's going on , but someone gave us up . - The senator had inside information . - I know . Details . It 's like Nadeer had eyes inside our ... Our headquarters . - Hey . J ... - You 've been studying Aida even though you were ordered not to . - Yeah , Jemma , okay ... - I tried to give you a wide berth because I knew you were worrying it through , but this is an obsession . - You turned it on , didn 't you ? - It 's not an obsession . Fitz ... did you turn on Aida 's ocular receptors ? Okay . Okay , yes . I-I-I see where you 're going with this , - and you 're not wrong ... - We personally gave Radcliffe Deathlok 's eye technology . Aida has it inside her head , doesn 't she ? - Yeah , but , Jemma ... - A camera , watching us this whole time . Aida hacked our base ! Hell , it could 've been broadcasting . Nadeer knew the details of our mission . No , that 's impossible . I wasn 't in that briefing . Aida never saw that . Why on earth would you do this ? ! You put us all at risk in a hundred ways . Jemma . Jemma , please . Just stop , okay ? I have a working theory . I wanted to help you get through this obsession of yours , - but if you continue to ... - It 's not an obsession ! Jemma , it 's an investigation . [ Pounding on door ] What the hell did you do to me ? Answer me . What did you do ? - What tipped you off ? - Because I 'm not an idiot . And I got hurt . Oh , I was worried about injuries , but there wasn 't time to ... Tell me , how does it feel ? What 's your reaction ? " How does it feel ? " How much of me is me ? Am I even me at all ? ! I assure you , the real Melinda May is fine . She 's safe and healthy ... and under my protection . I don 't care about your assurances . You had me spy on my own people . " Your own people " ! That 's delightful . Please , believe me , everyone is gonna come out of this all right . I don 't know . Once I tell Coulson , it might be rough for you . - You 're not telling Coulson . - Why not ? Because you have a mission . Call it an instinct . It 'll kick in when it 's time . Till then , you won 't be able to jeopardize what you need to do . - What mission ? - See , I sent you in unaware so that you would seem more real . I didn 't want you distracted by such ... things . You can 't know when May 's memories end and my coding begins . It 's all one . - You 're wrong . - I know it 's not easy to accept . There 's enough May in me to do what has to be done . You can 't . Sorry . It 's programming . That 's why I won 't tell Coulson who I am ? Did you program me so I can 't tell anyone ? No . I programmed you so you wouldn 't want to . [ Music ] There 's no reason to resist . You don 't need to . Why don 't you simply ... do what you truly want ? What do you think I want ? Come now . We both know . - You don 't know me . - Mm . I 've been inside your brain . I know what you want , or , rather ... whom . See ? You do know . I 've seen the closeness between you . It 's always been there , but you 've been resisting that , too . Why ? If only May ... and you , for that matter ... could be ... happy . Forget duty and honor and simply take what you want . You are who you are . - You 're wrong . - I 'm not . But May has no time for happiness . She 's too busy fighting some fight she 's already lost in her past long enough to enjoy ... Is that it ? Is that what May needs ? [ Door slams open ] Get away from her . What 's ... Fi ... Fitz , what 's going on ? You don 't talk to him . Did you think he wouldn 't find out ? Fitz had a theory after Aida betrayed us ... that it wasn 't reading the Darkhold that changed her . That you programmed her to do it . - He was right . - Fitz , I can explain . [ Holster clicks ] May ? What are you doing here ? Something Fitz said got me thinking . And then the leak . Came to see what he knew . And the truth came out . Get him out of here . - Hey . - Hey . How 'd the mission go ? Not well . We could have used you . Well , I 'm sure that ... I 'm tired of playing games , Mack . Coulson said that if I wanted to know where you went today , I should ask , and he 's right . [ Breathes deeply ] Um ... I went to see my ex . [ Sighs ] I-I 've been wanting to talk to you about this , and ... - tell you about Hope . - Hope . Mm-hmm . - All right . That 's it , then . - Elena ... No , I 've been giving this a lot of thought . And you know , we go out to dinner , and then you do nothing , and then we do something , and then you go away . Because I don 't take this lightly . Look , Mack , I like you . You know that . But this ... I 'm not a jealous woman . I don 't pry , I don 't nag . That 's not me . That 's a ... That 's a cliché . - And I refuse to be a cliché . - Yes , I know . So , if you want to be a man that has secrets and goes off and meets other women , that 's fine . But that 's another cliché I 'm not interested in . I love that you 're not a cliché . [ Sighs ] Hope was my daughter . And she died . - Oh , my God . - No . It 's ... It 's okay . It 's ... It was 11 years ago . My ex , Nicole ... we had a life planned together . She got pregnant , and we were happy . But ... when Hope was born , it was , uh ... it was touch and go ... and she only lived for four days . Her story was over before it ever started . - Mack , I didn 't know ... - No , I know . I know . But tomorrow 's Hope 's birthday . And Nicole has a hard time with it . That 's why she texted me . So I went to see her so she wouldn 't be alone . Maybe I wanted to spend a day remembering Hope , also . [ Sighs deeply ] I 've been wanting to tell you that for a while . Oh , I 'm so sorry , Mack . [ Music ] Long day . Drink . - Today wasn 't great . [ Sighs ] - Cauliflower isn 't great . Today was a kick in the balls . You know that won 't be the end of it . Nadeer busted us . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s on the ropes again . - Talbot 's pissed . - Talbot 's always pissed . Yeah . But this time he has a point . I was reckless . Why didn 't I listen to him ? You were protecting your people . - Yeah , but ... - Reckless ? Maybe . Who cares ? Phil ... we are who we are . - Flaws and all . - And you 're fine with that ? Yeah . I am . [ Music ] Fitz ! Oh , Fitz , this has all been a big misunderstanding . You have to believe me . - Things just got out of control . - Yeah , they did . You know , the whole time I was testing my theory , looking into what you did , do you know what I wanted to find more than anything ? That I was wrong . - I know ... - Because you 're my friend . But it 's a pattern . I almost hoped this time it was my paranoia . I actually hoped I was paranoid . [ Sighs ] But no . You 've turned on everyone . No , no , Fitz , I didn 't want to hurt anyone . I-I-I wanted to help everyone . That ... That ... That 's ... That 's what this is about . These people matter to me . You 've got a sociopathic way of showing it . I don 't bond well with actual people . You know that . When you rescued me from Hive , they were ready to lock me up . You believed in me . You stood by me . - My mistake . - No , it wasn 't . You 've been more than a friend . - You 've been like a son to me . - Yeah , well ... that 's why this sucks . I get overeager , Fitz . You know that . But I meant well . I still do . Talk to them , Fitz . Help me explain it to them . [ Sighs ] - You 're mad . - I wouldn 't harm anyone . My only goal is to preserve life . My first priority , always . [ Music ] Right . Fitz . Fitz , no ... - [ Door opens ] Wait ! - I need to borrow that , please . [ Gun cocks ] I-I still have feelings . I still care about you , Fitz ! I 've got to hand it to Radcliffe . You certainly act like it . [ Gunshot ] [ Grunts ] [ Electricity crackles ] [ Distorted electronic voice ] I still care about you , Fitz . I still care about you , Fitz . I still care about you , Fitz . Fitz ... [ Electricity crackling ] [ Music ] Gonna need some assistance . - Medical and engineering . - Yes , sir . - Looks like you have a problem . - I knew this was coming . I knew it the moment Aida failed to get the Darkhold I wasn 't safe . So I replaced myself . And that 's when you first called me . Seemed prudent , given how exposed I 'd become . I said I needed your protection . Now you can see why . But I won 't be the one protecting you . You 'll have to meet the Superior . Fine . Whatever it takes . [ Music ] How 's our guest ? Didn 't give you any lip , did she ? Aida 2.0 : Not at all . She 's been a model patient , even with the move . [ Monitor beeping ] - I tried the scenario you suggested . - Uh-huh . A memory . Well , an altered memory , but there was enough for me to work with . I 'm easing her pain . It 's working even better than the other programs . May herself proved to be the key . Peacefulness wasn 't enough . She 'd keep fighting . And fighting wasn 't enough . She 'd win . But once I remembered that she was fighting a fight she 'd already lost ... all I had to do was change the fight ... take her back to Bahrain . [ Music ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Did you see that move ? How did she take out that many people ? Had to have been 30 guys . Man : They 're saying the mother was the one who made everyone crazy with her powers . - Agent May took them all on . - Man # 2 : The Cavalry went in after all . Andrew : Melinda ? [ Radio chatter ] I did it , Andrew . Thank you . I saved the girl . Yeah . [ Music ]

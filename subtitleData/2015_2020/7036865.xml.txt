 Previously , on " Stitchers " ... His father is James Miller , the man behind the $ 3 billion Ponzi scheme that wiped out how many people 's life savings ? He died . The funeral was yesterday . Kirsten , meet my brother . You can take the girl out of the trailer , - but you can 't take the trash ... - What the hell is wrong with you ? Amanda , go ! - Thanks for saving my life . - I was just so afraid of losing you . My life makes sense with you in it . - Are you still working with Stinger ? - No . I am not working with my father . I know where my mother is . I didn 't feel right about keeping that from you . Inside that cabinet , there 's a device that 's connected to how our cases get picked . Remember how I said I 'd help you save your mother ? I meant it . We both have criminal , absent , pathetic fathers . Except the only difference is you 're desperate to find yours and all I want to do is forget mine . Cameron ? Guess what I have ? What ? Early Spielberg . " Duel , " " The Sugarland Express , " and please don 't tell your mother , " Jaws . " Thanks . Hey . Why the face ? Richie Freedman wanted to come over . Mom said no . Again . Germs . Can he please come over , Dad ? You had heart surgery , Cam . Richie 's a great guy , he 's a lot of fun , but when the two of you get going ... You still gotta take it easy . For how long ? It 's been over a year ! Everything is gonna be great one day , Cam . I promise you . Excuse me , Sir . Any word on James Miller ? It 's been two hours . He 's been told you 're here . Attention . Code 1 . I have code 1A , Area 5 . - Sorry , Sir . You need to leave . - What 's going on ? Fire alarm . Ma 'am . Ma 'am . All visitors proceed to the nearest exit . It 's just weird , you know ? Yeah , I didn 't even know you wanted to see him . It 's been , what ... 13 years ? - Fourteen . - Hm . - So , why now ? - I don 't know . I guess Linus 's father dying affected me more than I realized . Or feelings for you are making me want to reach out to my family . That 's sweet . Well , not so sweet that he wanted to see me . Well , look . It 's a prison . The delay could have been anything . I don 't know . Maybe it was just a stupid idea to go in the first place . Hey , what 's up ? Welcome back . I need everyone back here . Okay , but why don 't you text like usual ? - Why the call ? - Something has happened to your father . He 's under lockdown . We have a new case that requires us to break protocol . Oh good , we haven 't pissed off the NSA in hours . - Not now , Camille . - What 's up ? - Fisher ? - Victim is Gary Parsons , 55 . A veteran officer with the Federal Bureau of Prisons . Had a clean record and a history of commendations until he was killed earlier today . By James Miller . Dude . That doesn 't make any sense . I was just there . Now , Miller claims that Parsons attacked him without provocation and that he killed him in self-defense . The area of the attack had no witnesses and no cameras . If convicted , the killing of a federal prison guard is the death penalty . I 've used my authority to order a stitch into Parsons . Let 's find out what really happened and why . I 'm in the prison . Parsons is friendly , well-liked . - By the inmates or other guards ? - Everyone . Miller 's helping younger inmates . Looks like he 's teaching them math , or accounting . I guess cheating investors out of $ 3 billion qualifies you to teach . - Jimbo . - Gary . - You got a moment ? - Yeah , you bet . They 're in Miller 's cell . - The wife 's lasagna . - Oh ... - I know it 's your favorite . - Thanks , Gary . Thanks for saving us on that tax return . Anytime . They 're friends . They do each other favors . Hey ! Welcome back ! Did I hear total remission ? Can you believe it ? Parsons was out a while . Cancer it sounds like . Miller was happy to see him . - That 's good news . - It 's good to be back . - I found an earlier hot spot . - Stand by . Moving you . If Bruce tries to get to Miller , - I need to know right away . - Sure . - He 's on the phone to someone . - Can you tell who ? Adult male . He wants a warning if someone named Bruce ever tries to get to Miller . Bruce seems to be some kind of threat . Found another memory hot spot . I think Miller 's in this one , too . - Moving you again . - He 's back in his cell . Jimbo . Your son 's still waiting . What do I tell him ? Don 't tell him anything . Just let him go home . - What 's going on ? - Nothing . We 're running out of time . Okay , I 'm moving you to the death memory . I 'm back where Parsons was on his cell . Miller 's with him . She didn 't say who it was , just that she 'd call back in five . How did she get your number ? Jimbo , I 'm sorry . Gary ! I 'm making a bounce ! Your father was telling the truth . It was self-defense . Parsons attacked first . - Why ? - I don 't know , but maybe Bruce does ? - Hey . - Mm ? Can you maybe help a girl out ? - With what ? - With not , uh , totally freaking out ? - Trouble in paradise ? - Paradise in paradise . So , everything 's great with you and Amanda ? It 's better than great . - But ... - You 're waiting for the shoe to drop . I 'm a dropper , not the dropee , typically . - You 're scared . - Well , yeah . Though I did just take down a Lucky Charms Luna-bitch armed with a kitchen knife . But that I know how to do . This is scarier . Good . Then get your head out of your ass and just be the person you are inside . Ugh . That sounds like a nightmare . Why do they ask me for advice ? Oh , God . Still texting with Ivy ? More like to Ivy . How many times did you text her without a response ? Linus , when a girl doesn 't text you back right away you don 't just keep ... Are you kidding me ? One , two , three . Stalker . Scary stalker . Run-for-your-life stalker . I 'm just worried something happened to her . Unless I 'm coming off too strong . I can do that sometimes . It turns some people off . Linus . Not again . Principal Bruckner says you 've been showing off to the other boys ? Bragging that you know Pi to 175 digits . One-hundred and eighty-five , Papa . Maybe I need to act stupid , then they would like me . Linus ... there 's something I have to tell you . Your mother and I have been offered jobs in Los Angeles . You will have everything there . A nice house . A new school . And friends ? Will I have friends there ? You will have all the friends you want . I 'd be happy with one . Maybe you and Ivy just aren 't ... such a good idea . I thought you were starting to like her . I don 't really know her . And neither do you . - You wanted to see me ? - You must be relieved . What , that my father didn 't do it ? Yeah . Yeah , I am . But for a while there , I thought maybe he did . I don 't really know him anymore , you know ? Well , hopefully that 'll change . So , lets talk about what happened while I was away . You mean , like , the two cases solved and how the lab didn 't blow up ? You wanna tell me why you had Camille run a few of the stitches ? It 's funny , I don 't remember putting that in the report . Maggie sees all . I was just working through some , um ... concerns I had over Kirsten 's safety . I didn 't want it to affect the stitch , so I had Camille step in . - Okay , my turn . - For what ? Maggie sees all , but Cameron hears all , especially electronic sounds coming from inside that cabinet . So ... what 's the dealio with the magical mystery box ? - You broke in . - You say , " broke in , " I say , " keyed in the six-digit unlock code . " Point is , I know it has to do with how our cases are picked . So come on , Maggie . Boss to interim Boss , who 's on the other end picking our cases ? - It 's classified . - We all know why our cases are picked . If I only knew who did the picking , I could talk to them . I could adjust the way we stitch , speed up the process , get Kirsten 's Mom out of that damn cryogenic tank she 's cooped up in . Do you know how hard it is for Kirsten to keep seeing her mother like that ? And where ... exactly ... does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger " cooped up " ? How long has Kirsten known where her mother is ? How many people did Cameron 's Dad screw over ? Hundreds , but people he stole from with the name " Bruce ? " - Fewer than ten . - That 's still a lot of angry Bruces . That 's why I 'm cross-referencing their names against the percentage of savings lost along with any record of death threats against Miller , which narrows our suspects to ... A much more manageable two . Looks like one of them died two years ago , leaving us with Scott Bruce . Last known address is outside Palmdale . Looks like he invested every penny . The house , the pension , he lost it all . - Divorced twelve years ago . - He must really hate Miller . Guys , Gary Parsons was diagnosed with Stage 3 melanoma last year . And while he was in remission , he still had a mountain of medical bills . He was about to file for bankruptcy and then that all changed when miraculously , two days ago , his bills were paid . So someone paid off Parsons to kill Miller . Scott Bruce ? You think Bruce squirreled away enough money to pay off Parsons ? Let 's find out . Hey , you wanna help me interrogate a 70-something potential killer ? Fishy . You always know just what to get me . Yo , bro , what happened ? Maggie happened . You look pale . - What 's wrong ? - Oh , I 'm fine . I just , uh ... I just need to figure out a way to see my Dad and find out what really happened . Camille and Fisher just left to talk to somebody who might be the Bruce we 're looking for . I 'll bet my father knows who Bruce is . I should go talk to him . Cameron . I saw your father tell Parsons he didn 't want to see you . Are we sure this is the place ? GPS , WAZE and my police scanner can 't all be wrong . Come on . Are you okay ? Are you hurt ? Do you need help ? I broke my bike . It was my birthday present , and I broke it . They can 't afford it , but they knew how much I wanted it . How am I gonna tell them I broke it ? Don 't worry , honey . Here . This should be more than enough to get it fixed . I 'm not allowed to take money from strangers . It 's okay , sweetie , this time . You 're the nicest person I ever met . You know , just in case fifty 's not enough . Thank you . Bye . Sucker . Oh , hell . Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is up to six months and a $ 500 fine . - Scott Bruce ? - Yes . Mr. Bruce , I 'm Detective Quincy Fisher , this is Agent Engelson of the NSA . We 'd like to talk to you about James Miller . Is he in trouble again ? Maybe . I 'm sorry to hear that . I owe my life to Jim Miller . What ? I 'm sorry , didn 't he steal , like , all your money ? He did . Either of you fish ? A little . This ... is a deceiver fly . The bass lock onto it , the same way I used to lock onto money . Oh , come on now , you 're not ... really going with a fishing analogy , are you ? All I 'm saying is before Miller , all I cared about was the almighty dollar . Well , sure , but you must have been - pissed when you lost it all , right ? - Of course . But I made the choice to invest with him , I got caught up in his claims of unrealistic returns . At some point , I had to own up to my own greed . That forced me to change . I got remarried , downsized , and now I live a much simpler , much better life . Thanks to Jim Miller , I finally started to care about what really matters . Thank you for your time . Sorry to bother you . No worries . I hope Jim 's okay . Tell me you 're not buying this . Deceiver fly ? - What are we doing ? - He seems happy to me . No one 's happy in a trailer park . No way that guy squirreled away enough money to pay off Parsons ' medical bills . He 's not our Bruce . Let 's go . - You wanted to see me ? - Yeah , come on in . Take a seat . This isn 't a trip to the principal 's office , is it ? - Ha ! Not yet . - Okay ... - How are things going with Ivy ? - Isn 't that private ? No , not really . Look , I know that she helped with the team ... - I know you don 't trust her ... - If you 'd let me finish , I said , I know that she helped with the team , which is why I am considering letting her work with us . - Really ? - Yes , of course she has to be vetted and cleared first . I mean , nothing is guaranteed , but I am willing to start the process . I just wanted you to know . Thanks . Don 't make me regret it . I know you won 't . So , I 'm thinking about going and seeing my Mom tomorrow . You want to come ? Sure . You 're quiet tonight . Yeah , there 's a lot on my mind with my Dad and Maggie coming back . I hope she appreciates how you handed back the keys to the lab without a single dent . Ha . Actually , she was more concerned about me turning over some of the stitches to Camille . Well , that was only two of them . Well , I handled that one okay , I think . It 's just , um , then I asked her about the cube and the credenza , and who 's selecting our cases , and , uh ... you know , because I wanted to find out for you . What did she say ? Nothing helpful , so I pressed her ... Were you guys gonna use this ? What am I saying . Okay . Updates . So , I 'm sorry to report Scott Bruce was a bust . Apparently the man is perfectly happy with his trailer park existence . No accounting for taste . So it looks like he 's not the Bruce Parsons was talking about . Plus , all Parsons ' medical bills were paid from an offshore account which is proving to be impossible to source , even for me . So , dead end ? Well , until Miss " Eggshell Blue " here can stitch back into Parsons . The head trauma 's giving us over a day left on the refractory period . And for your information , this is " Ice Blue . " Again , no accounting for taste . Go talk to your Dad . Just ask him who Bruce is . We 're NSA , we have badges . He doesn 't want to talk to me . And if anyone hears that Miller 's been talking to the NSA , they 'll think he 's a snitch . Which can really shorten your prison time . The only person that can safely talk to Cameron 's father right now is his lawyer . Well , Counselor . He said my lawyer was here to see me . You 're not the only one who can pull off a scam . Okay , look ... just so you know , there are a lot of things I want to say to you right now . But for now , I 'll just say this . I work for the government , and I am here to help you . Hold on . You work for the government ? I-I thought you were a PhD . Oh , so you have been keeping tabs on me . - You 're my son . - You remember . Okay , I get that you 're angry . You have no idea how I feel . Why would you ? You haven 't picked up a phone in fourteen years . Cameron , it 's complicated . - I need you to leave now . - No . Not until you help me make it less complicated . I know all about Parsons . Why 'd he attack you ? Who 's Bruce ? Bruce ? What are you talking about ? Can you think of anyone who might 've paid Parsons to kill you ? Okay , we 're done here . No . One more question . Where 'd you put the money ? After you were caught all the money was accounted for except for thirty million . - Where did you hide it ? - Leave . Now . Cameron , it 's for your own good . Right . Because you 've always done such a good job of protecting me . Dad ! James Miller , Joe Zeiss , Securities and Exchange Commission . You 're under arrest for securities fraud , investment adviser fraud , mail fraud , wire fraud , three counts of money laundering , and false filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . - Dad ! What 's happening ? - Get your hands off my son . - Let go of me ! - Where 's his mother ? - She 's at work . - Don 't hurt him ! Cam , I 'm fine . Please calm down . He just had heart surgery . - Let go of my Dad ! - All right , everyone just relax . Cameron , everything 's going to be okay . We 're calling your Mom and a nice lady from the police is gonna stay with you until she gets here . What are you doing with my Dad ? We just have to take him down to the police station because we need to ask him a few questions . Dad , did you do something wrong ? I 'm done here . Miller just had a visit from his lawyer . I thought Miller could do better . The kid looks a little green . Describe him . White male , twenties , big hair . That wasn 't his lawyer . Maybe we should just call it ? Call who now ? Girl , you 're so far away I need a passport to reach you . I 'm sorry . It 's this case I 'm on right now . It 's just ... It 's bringing up a lot of really bad memories . Bad memories of what ? Oh , God . Why do you like me ? Wow . These memories must be potent . No , I 'm serious . Why do you like me ? Like ... why does anyone , you know ? I 'm ... sarcastic and cynical and not very nice . Fine , I 'll play . - You 're beautiful . - Ugh ... And smart . And funny . And you 're kinder than you think . - You 're honest . - I 'm not , though . I hide how I feel all the time . Not with me . Maybe that just proves how good I am at scamming people . Are you deliberately trying to sabotage this ? No . I 've never seen this side of you . Well , this is me . Welcome to the sideshow . I 've known lots of people who are afraid of getting close , getting hurt . And you all do the same thing . You push people away . Hey , Kirsten . Sorry , I gotta go . Call me ... if you want . I 'm sorry , did I just walk in on something ? You think ? You know , sometimes you can be a little bit of a bully . Well ... sometimes you can be a little bit of a stupid . Excuse me ? You know , Kirsten , believe it or not , there are days when I actually miss the old " feelings challenged " you , because now you have this , like , huge emotional blindspot , where , when it comes to certain people , you actually care too much . Certain people ? Why aren 't you more suspicious of Ivy ? Yeah , she says she 's done with Stinger , but those are just words . News flash , Princess , out here in the real world , people lie . People lie all the time . Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is up to six months and a $ 500 fine . I told you , it 's not mine . I was holding it for someone . Really ? Who ? Me . It 's mine . Quiet , Milly . Don 't listen to her . - How old are you ? - Twelve . Don 't do this . I 'm the big brother , let me take care of you . Come on , all right . - Now , look at me . - Don 't tell her anything . Shut up ! Are you telling me the truth ? Is this really yours ? - Where 'd you get it ? - Found it . Out by the road . If I get another call about you loitering ... Yeah , okay , Officer . And next time you cross the line , I will arrest you , no matter how young you are . It 's pretty stupid of you , letting yourself get arrested to protect your sister . Brave ... stupid . Look out for her . You really screwed up this time ! - You could have been arrested ! - Why ? It 's your pot . You 're so lucky I covered for you . Stop smoking that crap , it 's making you dumb . - Where you going ? - Away from you , loser . Yeah , where you gonna go ? To the friends you don 't have ? Nobody likes you , Milly . Deal with it . People lie all the time . Why can 't you see that ? She 's my sister , and I 'm supposed to protect her . Ivy is an adult . She doesn 't need her baby sister protecting her . It 's unlocked . Hey , man , sorry for the last-minute text . Dude , it 's me . You don 't have to apologize . - Leftover risotto ? - I 'm good , thanks . I don 't have much of an appetite . - Okay , touch of the grape ? - That I can do . - So , what 's up ? - Ivy . - Dude ... - I know . Look , I know . Just ... things were going great and then all of a sudden she started ghosting me . - I don 't know what to do . - Well ... I 've been on a roller coaster with Kirsten since day one , so I 'm probably the worst person to ask . How did things go with your Dad today ? I don 't know , not well . I offered to help him , and he told me to leave . I 'm so sorry , man . It 's okay . It just ... It just makes me realize , you know , what you had with your Dad , and ... I realize how much you must miss him . Linus ... Linus ... Not again . What happened ? The upperclassmen . They don 't like a fifth grader being smarter than them . - Were you showing off again ? - No . They jumped me for my notes . It 's not worth it . Don 't fight them , Linus . Just give them the notes ! But they 're my notes . I did the work , not them . It 's just like it was in Michigan . Everybody hates me here . It 's okay , Linus . Things will get better . And until then , you 'll always have your mother and me . I don 't want you . I want friends . Easy there , buddy . All right , heads or tails ? Uh ... let 's go heads . Okay . All right , heads it is . You go , I pay . That was fast . Yo . Hey ! What ... You saw James Miller today . What did he tell Who ? I don 't know who you 're talking about . - What did he tell you ? - Nothing ! Hey , let him go ! - Yo , dude . Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - What was that ? - They knew I saw my Dad today . They wanted to know what he told me . I didn 't tell them . Yeah , yeah . You 're smart . That was pretty bad-ass . Maybe next time , you pay , I go , huh ? Deal . Someone really doesn 't want you talking to your father . Or they want you talking so they can get information . Or Camille 's just saying that so she can disagree with me . Not everything 's about you , Princess . I think they 're just after the mountain of Ponzi cash - they assume my dad 's sitting on . - That makes sense . I just don 't know how they 're connected to Parsons . - Any thoughts , " Sister of the Year " ? - Let it go . Dude , there is a current of subtext flowing through here like hot molten magma . Let 's disperse . No , stay right there . I want you both to hear this . I am not picking between my friend and my sister . I didn 't ask you to . Good , because Maggie is thinking about giving Ivy a chance with all of us . Really ? I can 't even . What is that about ? Ah , nothing . Just a little tension in the team . Does Kirsten know that you told me about her mother ? No , I haven 't told her yet . Maybe it 's best that you don 't . So , Ivy , huh ? Look , I 'm sorry , Linus . Kirsten and I are having a thing . And Amanda and I are having a thing , and now I guess you and I are having yet another thing . There 's that killer Ahluwalia smile . Is Ivy still radio silent ? Yeah . Well , sometimes people just need space . Amanda 's been ... ghosting me all morning . It 'll pass . You think so ? Yeah , if we can both stop acting like such idiots . Look , I 'm not doing anything ... until you ... make good on your promise . Parsons is meeting some guy in a Benz in a parking lot . Suit . Beard . Mid-Forties . Banker type . Your medical bills will be paid by the end of the day . It 's the guy who paid Parsons' medical bills . The guy who paid to have my father killed ? Can you get the license plate number ? Not yet . Parsons is standing next to the car . He might not have seen the plates . Whoa . I think Parsons' head injury is affecting the stitch . - She 's slipping in and out of sync . - Try to lock it down . Got it . You 'll be in remission and debt free . Not a bad way to live , as long as you hold up your end . Guy 's driving off . Get the plates . Sorry , too late . I 'm in another memory . I 'm in the prison , I think . It 's hard to see . - Try now . - How 's it looking , Shawshank ? Parsons is calling someone . Hey . Yeah , uh ... Bruce is here to see Miller . Want me to get him out of here ? Yeah , this is Parsons in Area 5 . Code 1A . Yeah , I 'm smelling smoke down here . - Sync is out . - I 'm bouncing . Okay , that was weird . Parsons ' head injury made it hard to hold sync . No , not that . Bruce tried to visit Miller in prison , but Miller wouldn 't see him . And to make sure that Bruce left , Parsons called in a fire alarm . Dad , did you do something wrong ? I see you like Batman . You know , you 're being so brave right now , it reminds me of Bruce Wayne . You know what ? That 's what I 'm gonna call you . Bruce . I 'm Bruce . So , if Bruce is Cameron , then the caller who asked Parsons to watch out for Cameron must be the guy from the SEC . It 's Joe Zeiss , their top gun out of DC . He nailed a bunch of mega-scumbags , then retired to Calabasas right after Miller 's trial . - That 's him . - And with a beard and fourteen years , the same guy I saw in the stitch . But why would he care if I came to see my father ? I can think of thirty-million missing reasons . Zeiss stole the money , hid it , then blackmailed your father into taking the blame in exchange for your safety . We did some checking . Zeiss is on a convenient business trip , - but he gets back tomorrow . - Then that 's when we will arrest him . - What about my father ? - Bring Miller in , make sure he 's safe . You look well . What part ... of stop texting , stop calling , stop harassing me , don 't you understand ? Come on . We 're family . We 're all each other has . That is not true . I have a sister ... have friends . I have a brilliant young man who loves me , but who I haven 't spoken to in days because I 'm afraid if he finds out you 've been talking to me he won 't trust me anymore . Listen to me , I know exactly how Maggie Baptiste thinks . She 's using Linus to get to you , to get to me . But I 'm smarter than she is . That 's why I want you to stay close to Linus . Make him trust you . Help us find out where Jacqueline is . No . How do you think your new friends would feel ... if they found out who was really behind the Young Cameron anomaly ? Get out of my apartment . Where am I ? Someplace safe . Somewhere Joe Zeiss can 't try to have you killed again . Look , I know the truth . I know Zeiss skimmed the $ 30 million and pinned it on you . I know he threatened to kill me if you ever told anyone the truth , and you did an extra seven years because of it . Tomorrow , Joe Zeiss is gonna be arrested . And I 'm gonna do it myself . You can arrest people ? I thought you were a government scientist . There 's a lot about me from the last 14 years you don 't know . When you were sick , and it looked like your mother and I were going to lose you , you have no idea what that did to me . And the thought that that bastard Zeiss was out there watching you , that he might hurt you ... - You don 't have to protect me anymore . - I don 't know how to stop . Look , the prosecutors are reviewing your case . Any of this might lead the way to a ... reduced sentence . I made some mistakes , Cam . I never set out to hurt anyone . And then I got in too deep before I could make the investors whole again . I 'm just so embarrassed for you to see me like this . I deserve to be in jail for what I did . But not for what you didn 't . - She 's gone ! - Whoa . Who 's gone ? My mother . Her chamber , the computers , the monitors ... everything is just gone . Stinger must have found her . God , that son of a bitch ! Kristen , just calm down . It wasn 't ... it wasn 't Stinger . - It was Maggie . - Maggie didn 't know where she was ! What did you do ? I was just talking to Maggie and it ... It slipped . It slipped ? My mother 's location just slipped out ? - Kirsten ... - I trusted you , Cameron , with the most important thing in the world . How could you betray me ? Kirsten , I didn 't mean to . I just ... Can be please talk ? Hey . Listen to me . Just stay , please . No . Right now , I wouldn 't want to be with you even if I could . - Where are you going ? - To be with someone that I trust . - Hey . - Hey . Thanks for coming . I 'm , uh ... I 'm ... Sorry about the other night ? Yeah . God , am I really that much of a cliche ? No , you 're just ... that much of a human being . I 'm sorry I walked out . Me , too . I kind of really took it out on Kirsten . I guess I owe her an apology . Oh , please . Get in line . Amanda , this whole thing with us ... the whole " take off your armor and bare your soul " thing , it 's new to me . I 'm bad at it . It 's really scary but it 's so great , because I just think ... I think you 're so awesome and ... the way you make me feel when I 'm with you and ... I just ... I really ... uh ... Really ... ? I really think you are worth taking a shot on . " Worth taking a shot on " ? Yeah . You just don 't get it . What ? I don 't want to be anyone 's shot . Nice place . Yeah . Zeiss knows how to spend other people 's money . - You ready for this ? - Let 's get him . All right . Hi . What 's your name ? - Andrew . - Andrew . Is your Dad home ? Not now . What 's up ? Not in front of his son . You sure ? Hey , Andrew . I think we have the wrong address . Okay . Hey , Ivy . It 's me . Look , I 'm not sure what 's going on here , but ... I just wanted to let you know that I 'm here for you whenever you need me to be . And I wanted you to know that I 'm your friend .

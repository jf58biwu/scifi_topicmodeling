Nice to meet you , too . - Who are you ? - Who are you ? You are the first people we have seen in days . Hey , relax . No one is going to hurt you . - Have you seen her ? - Have I seen who ? That woman dressed in white . I will go look . Jesus ! Girl take a pill . I found these . Does it work ? What ? Nothing . I am just thinking . Can you give me some more light ? Sure . This place ... is fucking huge . Shit ! It does not work . What exactly is your problem ? I do not trust you . I cannot remember anything . Join the club . How long have you been here ? We ran into each other a day ago , maybe two . How about you ? A while . Do you see that ? What is the last thing you remember ? Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . - Are you sure ? - I am good . Not even your name . No . Look at this . We have to get out of here . Did you find her ? No . This place is alive . We do not know anything about them . We do not know anything about ourselves . They are just prison . No shit , Sherlock . There is a passageway . What time do you think it is ? It is night . And how would you know that ? I can feel it . What are you , a psychic ? I wish . At least I would know my name . Do you hear that ? I do not hear anything . Exactly . There is nothing to hear . I am telling you ... It is night . Unless we are underground . Are you okay ? Is she dead ? No , she is still breathing . Who the fuck is that ? He cannot see us . We have to get her out of there . We ? Look at him . Do you really want to go in there ? We cannot just leave her like that . I think he moved . He did not move . Let us go . Hey ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - Breathe . - Yeah . Go lay ... lay on your side . Lay on your side . No , no . This way . - Perfect . - Just hold it . Hold it ! Son of a bitch , you could have killed me . You will be fine . Sorry . She looks okay . Where am I ? What happened to you ? I do not remember , just a black corridor . - What about him ? - Who ? No . I do not know him . I think he is gone . Maybe we should look . Maybe we should not . Is this I ? I do not even remember what I look like . You look okay to me . I can see you . Why do not we have any memories ? I do not ... even remember my parents . It is called selective Amnesia . What is that ? It is followed by Trauma . We remember how to walk , talk , all of the essentials . Yet , we have no recollection of the details of our lives . Hey , who wants lunch ? Hey , hang on . What is the expiration date on it ? Seriously ? We should go . Well , hang on . What about him ? He stays . I will watch him . I will go with you . I , too . This place , it reminds me of something . Did you have a nice nap , shithead ? Hey ! Hey . Maybe he knows something . Hey , asshole , do you know something ? Do you know something ? I am talking to you . Where are we ? We are in hell . We are in hell . What is that ? I have seen this . - Help ! Help ! - Are you okay ? Yes . All right , just stay there . We will see if we can get to you through another way . Come on . Contender eliminated . Ten little Indians standing in a line . One toddled home , and then there were nine . Do you trust the others ? I do not know . It is almost like I know them from before . I would be careful if I were you . So , do not you trust me either ? We lost her . It was a dead end . She was there one second , then gone the next . Who the hell are you ? Where is the girl ? I ... I lost her . Which girl ? There was a girl with us . We were being chased . You were being chased . Chased by who ? Hello . - Hey . Hey ! - Try it . What did you do with our friend ? I do not know anything about your friend . I do not believe you . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Look ! Everybody just ... just calm down . Who put you in charge ? Do you have shit for brains ? No , I just wanted a private conversation . You cut it out because , we need to find her . Easy , just drop the club . Yeah , just drop the club . Then we can all figure out . What the fuck is going on . - We saw the blood . - I was hunting . Why were you following us ? I have been down here on my own , for at least a month now . You are the first people I have seen . I know you . Shit ! We have to move fast . Hey , hey , hey . Relax . Stop . Now we are going to get serious . - What happened ? - Hey ! Do you mind ? It will cut me in half , please ? Come on . Come on . - No ! - No ! Contender eliminated . Well done ! However , remember , only one can survive . I know this room has two doors . Where are the others ? I do not know . The room was empty . I do not understand , what is going on ? Hey , wait . Did you say that you know ... that girl in the mask ? How ? I do not know , okay ? I mean , I think so . Try to remember . It is important . He is trying to remember . You do not touch me ! Okay . Hey , I am sorry I touched you . I was just trying to help . I am not a bad person . How am I supposed to know that ? Well , I just told you . I was not the one that was tied to the wall . I do not even remember why they tied me up . You attacked us . - I ? - Yeah . I do not remember . Try a little harder . Contenders off course . Activated containment measures . Run ! - What happened ? - I do not know . There is a passageway back here . Come on ! Now things get interesting . What are you eating ? Tastes like chicken . Yeah , lots of chickens in here . I am okay . Thank you . Careful ! Just do not ... You do not touch it . Where did that thing even come from ? I cannot move my hand . It is just attached itself to my arm . It is as I knew where to find it . Who were all those people ? I do not know . However , they knew we were coming . They were waiting for us . What the hell ? Hold on a second . Stop it . I am a mess . What are you doing ? Wait ! Let me see . - You have one , too . - What ? Looks just like your tattoo . I do not have a tattoo . The one on your neck . What the fuck are you talking about ? Yeah , it is just like hers . No , they are different . You have one , too . Why ? Let us give them something else to think about . Enable memories . What are you looking for ? Cameras , microphones . Whatever is telling them where we are ? What are we doing ? Did you find anything ? No . Nothing . I remember . I was a soldier . The siege of Malta ... in 1565 . - Maybe in your dreams . - No . It was real . Open your mind . My last memory is June 25 . 2154 . I was happy . That is impossible , because it is 2016 . It is June of 2016 . No , it is not . You are brainwashed . Both of you . What the hell is that ? Adora ? We have a neural anomaly . Find out what it is . Yes , Adam . Come closer . I see you . You may go . I will need you again in an hour . It is an honor to serve you , Chancellor Gordon . No ! Wait ! I want to have a word with her . I still have not figured out , what you did to my system ... Or how you pulled it off . Anita , I do not like traitors . You are the traitor , Adam ! You betrayed the Network ! Betrayal is such a subjective term . Anyway , I am glad you have your memory back . Tell me how you inverted the process . Do you know what , Adam ? Go fuck yourself ! Tell me why the others are unstable . You know I do not like secrets , and you know how this will end . You do not make me hurt you , more than necessary . I am sorry , Adam . 78 seconds to link up . Okay . We will finish this later . No . No . No . No ! No ! No ! These are the same symbols . We saw them before . Do you remember ? Yeah , on that wall . So , why is this on our neck ? There are ten of them . There are ten of us . There were ten of us . One each . The contenders are engaged , puzzle established . Various elements are being linked up . Now let us see if they can figure out , how to put them all together . As you know , we are missing a contender , but you do not to worry . She will be back . Now is the time for commemoration . Unfortunately we have already had our first fall , killed by a coward who deserves the same fate , but ... That is not up to me . Andron decides . So ... honor to her . Honor to her . - Honor to her ! - Honor to her ! - Honor to her ! - Honor to her ! - Honor to her ! - Honor to her . Honor to her . - Honor to her . - Honor to her ! Does this make any sense to you ? No . It does not match yours . It does not match yours either . But even if we do link it to one of us , then what ? Freeze ! You are under arrest ! I was a Cop . Now I remember , before this , I was a Cop . I knew there was a reason I did not like you . - What kind of Cop ? - Network Police . The Network ? The Network , the Nine Corporations . After the Big Catastrophe , the Nine Corporations took over the planet ... Twenty five years ago . We do not know what caused it , but it killed over nine billion people . A handful of people now own everything . Everyone else is starving . You have no idea the things I had to do . Slavery is legal in my World . They are all slaves , at least two billion of them . So , what year do you think it is now ? 2154 . Bullshit , all of it ! So , then why are we all here ? I do not know . I was working in a case . This is yours . Contender 's DNA identified . Realize the truth . Hey . What is wrong ? I ... Nothing . We should go . Finally ! I thought I was going to have to hand-deliver it . The betting is on the up . You do not worry about that . I am not worried about it . I want to get rid of it . Let us level things up a little . Be careful . Are not you remembering yet ? Where would she go ? She was right behind us . Hey ! We are not safe out in the open like this . Are you okay ? I will tell you later . Let us get out of here ! Go , go , go , and go ! That is my girl . Corruption . Shit ! Adora ? Get those pictures back now . I cannot , they are off the grid . Then get them back on the grid ! - What ? - What happened to you ? Well , I am fine . No ! No ! God damn it ! You have disappointed us , Adam . Chancellor , I can explain . We will be back in a minute . I just have to reset . You know , how vital the neural connections are to us . I do ... Have I ever failed you before ? Something is seriously wrong with this game . The betting is on the rise . Which is why we cannot tolerate blackouts of any kind . I understand the gravity of the situation . It is important you remedy things , before the situation get out of hand . If you fail , there will be dire consequences . Excellency , this is not my first Redemption game . Moreover , I still have a few cards up my sleeve . Connection restored . Adora , I think it is time to bring in the Commander . Very well ! No . No . No ! What have you done ? Why ? What did I do to you ? I ... Wait ? Who did you bet on ? You are not like them ! You do not understand ! You will never be like them ! Do not you understand ? No . No , the Network is corrupt . Join us , save yourself . Save all of ... No ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! He got the fucking message ! How did you find me ? We got lucky . And we heard you through the ducts . You are off the grid . That is why they have not been able to locate you . The grid ? Yeah . First , let me handle the conditioning . Then I will explain everything . That is my tunnel . The conditioning occurs by walking through that tunnel . All the memories you had before then ... are erased , and new memories inserted . Wait ! Slow down . The conditioning ? Yeah , it adapts the players brains to the logic of the game . However , I managed to program a post-induced mnemonic return . In English , please . Sorry . Sorry . You will get your memories back . - Thank God . - You do not be so sure . - So , what is this ? - All this is Andron ... the Quest for the Contenders . Is all this a fucking game ? Worse . Escape , and you live . You do not , and you die . Hold on . Where are the others ? Two are dead . We all are separated . - Who died ? - Guy with the glasses , the woman , Cop . Do you know her ? Yes . So , what she said is true ... about the Network , and the Nine Corporations . Yeah , yes . - And the slavery ? - Yes . Jesus ! - We were all slaves . - Yeah . I have always treated you well , have not I ? I ... Yes , Chancellor Gordon . I have always given you everything you ever needed . Yes , you have . Then explain why you did it . Who did you bet on ? I have something to take care of . Then , we will talk . - So , why are we here ? - You volunteered ... to win the freedom for yourselves , and for those that you love . The winner can choose another ... three people of their choice . However , the memories we all have , they are all from different times . That is because every season , Andron changes era and setting . However , the virus I uploaded ... corrupts the game 's database . Do you work here ? I was head of the Medical Division , until I met the Cop . She was investigating Adam . Adam runs the Quest . What for was he being investigated ? He was manipulating the results . - On who lives or dies ? - Yes . Fuck this . I am out here . No . No , you do not ! You have Nano cameras attached to your retina . Then the Network transmits the images ... to viewers all over the World . What do you mean all over the world ? Yes , the ... the public , the slaves . They view this whole experience through your eyes . I hope I am not disturbing you . You know that Chancellor Gordon ... always lied to you , do not you ? In addition , all your memories are ... just a long series of fairy tales ... He is responsible for your parents die in the pits . However , you can change things if you wish . You no longer have to suffer under him . You know what I am offering , do not you ? Revenge . I would say Freedom . Moreover , thank you for providing me ... with the Chancellor 's files . Look ! Let us retrace your steps , and stay off the grid . May I ? Duck ! Come on . Let us go . Are you okay ? Are you okay ? Hey . Hey . Hey , look at me . Hey , look at me . Hey . Hey , it is over . It is over . Breathe . Breathe . Breathe . You all know him ... last 's Winner . Our champion has an announcement to make . It is about Andron . I decided to take part in the next Redemption game . Incredible ! This never happened before , a freeman deciding of his own free will to play again . However , why ? You have been released . You are rich . You are famous . I want to do it for those I lost . To honor their memory . In addition , for those I can save in the coming Quest . May the Gods be with me , and all those who bet on me . It is over . It is over . It is over . It is over . Breathe . It is over . It is over . Breathe . Breathe . I am not a slave . So , why do not you remember your name ? Of course I remember my name . My name is ... It is ... You do not remember , because you do not have a name . In this world , you are just a number . What do you mean ? A number ? A number . Look ! You will get your memory back soon . Then you will remember . I am not sure that I want to . So , how is it you managed to corrupt the system ? I inserted the virus into ... my bloodstream , and contaminated it . Look ! Your Nano cameras go straight ... to their neural connection . The slaves can bet their Freedom on you . What does that mean ? Well , it means if they win the bets , they are freeman like you . Nevertheless , if they lose , they die with you . This way . I do not want to live in a World like this . You do not have a choice ! None of us had a choice . You were with that lunatic when we found you . The double conditioning caused a brain Trauma . He knew the risk . He wanted to play again . Why ? Revenge . His whole family was wiped out by the Network . He knew the cop . It is done . We are just getting started . Take them . Adam stopped us , and when we woke up , he wiped our memories . And entered us back in game . And now ? I still have the files in my Neuron Chip . The people need to know the truth . Well , we need to get you out of here . Let us go find the others . I have been here before . Are you okay ? Now what ? I know the way through , once we are back on the grid . The Nano cameras will reactivate ... Then they will be all over us . As soon as we find the others . We will go straight for the crypt . Crypt ? It is our only way out of here . Which means we will have won ? And Adam will be stopped . There is more . When I downloaded the information about ... the conspiracy onto my Neuron Chip . I discovered the Catastrophe ... that killed nine billion people ... was deliberately started by the Network . You see . We will start a Revolution . Until a few years ago , many managed to win , and only some died . Unfortunately in recent years , our glorious game experienced far too many deaths . Good people who fought not only for their own Freedom ... nevertheless , the Freedom of all . Let us honor the fallen , and never forget them . Come . Come quickly . Where is the person with the glasses ? He did not make it . Are you the Doctor ? Yes . Do you remember me ? Welcome back my friends ... To the show that never ends . Let us shuffle this deck . I do not know . I ... More memories will come . Come on . Let us go . We have to protect the girls . Come on . Come on . Go , go , go ! Come on ! Go , go , and go ! Come on . You did not honestly think ... it was going to be that easy . Where is it ? It is gone ! It is there . Hey ! No . No . No . Contender eliminated . No . Hey ! You piece of shit . You killed her . Why ? Hold on . This is a hiding place . However , whose is it ? It is mine . It is not working ! You are moving too fast . Just take a deep breath . Contender 's DNA identified . That is my number . Hey , handsome ? What is going on ? Contender , enter the correct sequence ... to solve this Redemption game . Access granted . Redemption game solved . What is happening ? Because ... Clearly , we are not in Kansas anymore . Let me explain a few things . I warned you , Adam ! You will now pay for your incompetence ! Excellency , I ... We do not have the resources to keep ... more than two billion slaves alive ! I know that . We cannot risk it becoming public knowledge ... that we rig the games in order ... to keep the numbers in check ! But ... Excellency , you ordered me to ... It could trigger a Global Rebellion ! Now , when the winners are safe . You will admit your culpability . And turn yourself in to the Network Police . There will not be any winners . Excuse me ? Excellency ... I have a plan . No . I ... I do not understand . Something is wrong . It should not be like this . What should not be like this ? Wait . You are ready now . Wait . - She was my sister . - Who was ? The woman in white . In addition , you killed her , all of you . What are you talking about ? I remember now . Do you remember what ? Adam , he treated us like daughters . No . That is a lie . Your memories are wrong . You were conditioned . You are like us . You used to be like us . You are like us ! Run . Where is the ... fucking . No ! No ! Adora ? Call the Network Police to arrest Chancellor Gordon . He rigged the games . He killed competitors in cold blood . Moreover , he made money in the process . Hand him over to the Network Police . Yes , sir . Where would she go ? Where would she go ? It does not make any fucking sense . The Doctor said it was not supposed to happen like this . What do you mean ? The Neuron Chip . This is all an illusion . We still trapped inside the game . What are you saying ? Concentrate , tries to remember . Focus on what is real . Look at me ! What if she comes back . Concentrate . Close your eyes , and concentrate . Now I remember . I , too . The whippings , the chains . The pain . I am here to free my parents from the pits . Look ! Wait . Look . Let us go . Run ! Run ! Go ! I am not leaving you . How did you know ? Because , I am Sherlock . Neuron Chip . This is all an illusion . Well done ! Welcome to the Second Level . Now , you know the whole truth . You know , who is the master of this game .

[ running footsteps ] Octavia . You stayed . Screw you . Of course i stayed . I know where my loyalties lie . We have to get in there . If that was possible , Do you think i 'd still be out here ? Why did lexa sound the retreat ? She made a deal with mount weather , Freed the grounders , and now we 're on own . Stop ! They 'll know we 're here . What about lincoln ? There 's no way he Would have gone along with a plan like this . He didn 't they took him . What 's wrong with you ? I am getting through that door . And that 's your plan ? Bellamy 's counting on you . Everyone 's always counting on you . Well , what do you want from me ? You trusted lexa . You let a bomb drop on tondc . You let all those people- - I am doing the best i can ! Yeah ? Well , it 's not good enough . [ beep ] [ door opens ] Oh , bellamy . Ha ! I knew it . You two are too scrawny to drill . Hey . Ohh ! Heh . Bellamy : It 's all right . She 's with us . Where 's your army ? Gone just like yours . Say you have a plan . Not really . We need to talk to dante . Maya says he 's in quarantine . Jasper : Clarke ! Thank you . [ beeping ] 30 minutes . And we just changed it . That can 't be right . Uh , shh--um ... It 's her last tank . Hey . Uh , we 'll find you another one . All the supplemental oxygen is on level 5 . Then we have to get you to level 5 . 5 isn 't safe for any of us . We 'll take the trash chute again . It will work . To get in , maybe . Maya 's right . Every solider in this mountain is there . We 'll never make it out . We can do this . We 'll split up . Octavia : Ok . You guys go for dante . We 'll help maya . [ creak ] [ horse neighs ] [ horse neighs ] How could you do this ? I swore loyalty to this commander . She left our allies to be slaughtered . She dishonors us all . And your disobedience dishonors you . Why are you here , indra ? Because you are also tree crew . I can 't just let her die . Under the terms of the truce , The lands surrounding the mountain are forbidden . If you violate this , Lexa will never take you back . Octavia made her choice . Now you make yours . [ piano playing chopin 's " minute waltz " ] - You ? - Thank you . Sir , lieutenant emerson is back . You 're needed in the dorm . Ok . Oh ! Oh ! Aah ! On their knees . Oh ! Oh , god ! Oh ! Oh ! Down . [ woman sobbing ] We take any losses ? Not as many as they did , sir . I 'm afraid i 'm the only one left Who 's been cured . Some of the kids are still missing . If you 'd like , i 'll take a team in hazmats And sweep the other levels . No . No more wasted lives . In 48 hours , we will all be on the ground . Take off their hoods . Woman : No . - Dad ? - Nate ! Uh ! Uh ! No ! You bastards ! What is wrong with you people ? Where 's my daughter ? She 's talking about clarke . [ drill whirring ] I 'm sorry it had to come to this . Man : Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! - He 's dead . - That 's ok . We 've already got all of the marrow . Guards , we need another one . She 's next . No . No . Take me . Don 't touch her ! - Don 't touch her ! - Get off . Don 't touch her ! Don 't touch her ! [ woman screaming ] Woman : Please . No . Oh ! All right . Get a strap . Let 's go . Man : Please . Please don 't . - Huh ! - Yaagh ! Man : Hold her ! Hold her down ! No ! Get off me ! Woman : Oh ! Please don 't . Uh ... [ whirring ] No ... No , no ... No ! Hello , clarke . Sir , we need your help again . Monty : It 's ok . I took out the camera From the junction box in the hall . We can talk freely . No one 's watching , anyway . Thanks to you , they 're all on level 5 . - You 're not . - No . I 'm not . Bellamy : Please . We don 't have much time . We need a way to get our people out of this mountain Without killing everyone . He 's not gonna help us . You cut the power , risking the lives Of everyone in this mountain- - My people , even the ones who helped you . We knew they 'd be safe on level 5 . We made sure not to destroy the turbines So you could repair them . We 're the good guys here , not you . Tell me , if we released your people And theirs , what would 've happened to mine ? Can you get us into the command center ? We need to see what 's happening on level 5 . - No problem . - Let 's go . You 're gonna help us , Whether you like it or not . That 's- - Uh ... [ panting ] Ah ! Ahh ! Ah ! [ panting ] John , let me help you . I don 't want anything from you . Come on . You 're a survivor . We both are . Whatever you have to tell yourself Feel better , chancellor . Our destiny ... Is out there , john . And what about craig 's destiny ? We sacrificed a few to save the many . You know , you 're right . I am a survivor ... Which is exactly why I am done following you . I 'll go my own way . You can go whichever the hell way you want . John . John ! Get the hell away from me . You lost too much blood . Be still ! [ whirring ] Did you hear that ? Huh . Please , whoever you are , we need your help . Wait ! Wait ! John ... I can 't make it . Just go , all right ? We both know you want to . I 'll come back for you , john . Your promised land sucks ! I told you , there 's no one here . Sorry if we don 't take your word for it . Why aren 't you with your people on level 5 ? After what i 've done , they can be free . I can 't . Deliverance comes at a cost . I bear it so they don 't have to . It wasn 't cage . It was your idea to make the deal With the grounders . Monty : We 're in . Got it . It 's clear . He 's telling the truth . Ok . Let 's get the monitors up . Come on . We have to hurry . She 's out of air . First , you need to close the door . Uh ... [ gasping ] - Time to spare . - Heh heh . She 's safe . Could we go now ? I 'll be ok . Look . I 'm not leaving you . Jasper . She 's alive , but she 's not safe . Cage knows i helped you guys . He 's on level 5 . So what do we do ? We kill cage . I 'm in . I think command center is live . Clarke : Oh , my god . Is that raven ? Mom . Tell them to stop now . I won 't do that . Clarke : Emerson . Carl emerson , mount weather Security detail , come in . Who is this ? You know who it is . Give the radio to the president . Bellamy : They 're moving . Not a problem . I 'll bring it on main monitor . [ taps button ] Cage : This is president wallace . I have your father . If you don 't let my people go , I 'll kill him . How do i know you have him ? Stay the course , cage . You won 't do it . You don 't know me very well . This ends now . Release my people . I can 't do that . It would mean the end of our people , clarke . Bellamy : Clarke , we need him . And i need his son to believe me . Don 't make me do this . [ piano playing " minute waltz " ] Dad ... I 'll take care of our people . None of us has a choice here , clarke . I didn 't want this . Neither did i . Oh ! Uh ... [ moaning continues ] [ wheezing ] Listen to me very carefully . I will not stop until my people are free . If you don 't let them go ... I will irradiate level 5 . Clarke , on radio : Cage , listen to me . I don 't want anyone else to die . Stop the drilling , and we can talk . There must be a way to get us all out of this . - Emerson . - Sir . They 're watching us from the command center . Go kill them all . Yes , sir . Emerson is coming for us . They deactivated my key card . Can you do that to his ? That one 's easy . Where 's he going ? The dorm . Monty , can you do it ? Can you irradiate the level ? I can do it . Wait a second , clarke . We need to think about this . There are kids in there ... I know . And people who helped us . Then please give me a better idea . Take that one off the table . - Sir , we 're not done . - Now ! - Put her on it . - No . No . Please . Hey ! You don 't have to do this . Stop ! There has to be another way . - There isn 't . - No . What have i done ? Kane : No one has to die for bone marrow . We can donate it . We can donate it . Strap her down . Woman : Don 't hurt her ! No . Hey , we can donate it ! That 'll never happen . I can . I can make it happen with her help . We can all survive . We can 't . Proceed with the drilling . Steady . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Bellamy : Clarke , if we do this , there is no going back . Figure it out . [ typing ] This is taking too long . I mean , what if she got caught ? We 'd have heard something . Then what if she couldn 't find sergeant lee or- - I don 't know- - the protocol changed ? What if he got caught ? Jasper , a warrior doesn 't worry About what he can 't control . Oh , thank god . Anyone see you ? Lee , put down the gun . You didn 't say there was an outsider with you . She 's not an outsider . - Yes , she is . - She 's with us . Cage is in the dorms . They brought another group in from the ark , more marrow . They 're not even trying to fix the dam . How many soldiers with cage ? Uh , 6 . Why ? Just get me close . They 'll be happy you found another 8 doses . I need a- - Aim for the throat . Slash . Don 't stab . Make it deep . I hope you know what you 're doing . Me , too . - You got this . - Yeah .

 So if you 're just joining us , I am here with Andrew Kincaid . Brainchild behind sentinel , the world 's most rapidly growing video game company . And if I may say so , now , one of the most powerful men on the planet . You recently made headlines for your campaign against the preservation of the right to bear arms in this second amendment war that 's been raging in Washington . Complete with catchy slogan , " keep guns in games . " Well it 's something that I 'm very passionate about . We 've lost touch with how lucky we are to be here . Uh , we piss on the planet . We piss on the animals , on nature , and on each other . And then we raise our fists in protests for our right to own a gun while people are being killed left and right . And then we delude ourselves into believing that gun that we own could ever match might with the 21st century American military . Gun ownership in this country is an obsolete tradition . It can 't protect us anymore . In fact , it 's clearly hurting us . Well , certainly a very traditionalist perspective to support gun ownership . And the number of failed bills reflects that . Traditions still stand strong in America . That makes me very sad . I mean , what is it gonna take to get that point across ? And your solution would be to contain violence to video games ? Well , we 're never gonna contain it , but we can direct it . You wanna shoot something , you wanna shoot somebody ? Play a game . Play one of my games . Flight 's not delayed like we thought . Out the door in thirty , okay ? Ors , we are not gonna be able to sort through all these things . And speaking of your games , what can you tell us about the rumors that your top security officer , Orson creed , has been pushing to move sentinel into military contracts . Come on . I dare you . Orson , we need to go . Yeah , hold on . I need to hear this . And how it can best be used to serve to public . Mr. creed and I fall on different sides of the aisle . And let 's be clear about this . This is not the first time he 's tried to extract an intellectual property . But I could promise you , it will be the last . So Orson creed would be the one saying ... Under his direction , sentinel becomes a military tech developer . Are you hearing this ? Do you expect anything less ? Marrying ourselves to tradition has held us back . People are resistant to the future , but that doesn 't stop it from coming . And if it 's not me , it 's gonna be the next guy who takes up the reigns . At the end of the day , it 's your quarter . If any of you are unfamiliar with Mr. Kincaid 's gaming ambitions , and from the numbers , there can 't be too many . We 've heard of where you think Mr. creed is going to take sentinel ... Tell us what you 're doing here , what you 've done . I wanted to take the gaming world and I wanted to push it . I wanted to push the inner activity , the gameplay , the environment . Players wanna be in the game . And right now , we 're closer to that than anyone 's ever been before . Well , you know , some of your critics have been pretty vocal about their issues with that . Especially given your outspoken stance against guns . Yeah , I think you 'd be surprised how many of those critics have secret gaming accounts of their own . Look , I have an issue with guns on the street and I think that that issue will be resolved . So ... Take one more look around . I 'll start the car . Hey . I love you for not being him . In America , we are in the business of making money . Come here . If I can do that while making my country a little safer ? Buddy , I call that the American dream . People are literally controlled by their phones and their tablets and their social networks and the games that the play . Abbie ! We live in a world dominated by technology . Let her go . You can call it sad , or you can call it whatever you want . But you can 't argue one fact , it is now . Oh ... Just you . Just me . Come on . Thought you might come outside for this one . Quit playing around . Come on . Give it to me . Man , when is Kincaid gonna stop with all the discs ? Yeah , I guess it is kinda old school for a new school guy , huh ? Really nice way to say someone 's paranoid . Says the man who refuses to leave his house . Shut up , Bernard . This is a new adventure . Stay tuned . - See ya . - Mhm . Right on time , my Princess . Oh , gee . You know how I love it when you call me Princess . So your highness , how art thou on this majestic morning ? I 'm good ! Another day at the office . Jerry brought me crepes for breakfast this morning . Jerry . That bastard . You tell that Jerry that you 're mine . All mine . Uh huh . That would require you to get out of your house and take me out . Oh , Princess . How can you resist my sex appeal ? Oh , nothing sexier than sitting on the other end of the phone while your coworker mods a game against protocol . You know , first of all , that only happened like three times . - Four times . - Whatever . And second , mods made the games better . Uh huh . Oh right . Let me give you your moment . So tell me about this game . Well , you won 't be modding this game . I can tell you that . Okay . This is the one . The Kincaid prophecy . The dream game . The one where you get to be in the world . Really ? This ? Oh , hey ! Keep talking . I 'm listening . Just gotta grab my pizza . Well , you 'll be testing the game frame mostly . Kincaid isn 't ready to reveal the real tech just yet . So can you tell me about it then ? Exactly how are you in this world ? No comment . Can we get some comment ? Any comment . Absolutely no comments . What about the rumors ? He said no comment ! Let 's go , let 's go . Hey , did you hear me ? Hello ? Sorry , no . Uh , let 's get started . We have a lot to cover . Alright . Let 's do this . From behind . Let 's go . Guys , we are on the clock . Gotta go , gotta go . Almost got it . Done ! Done . What ? Pack up the gear . I 'll get the girl . Come on , boys . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Enjoy the ride , old friend . Style is great . Realistic . Kincaid wanted a grounded universe . Meaning real human movement with a stylized aesthetic . To distract from the intense violence no doubt . You 're so smart . You know . Can 't say I 've seen a game start like this before . No menu , no options , no loading . Total immersion . That 's the goal . Man , that looks like Orson creed . So ? Guess they designed it before the total fallen out of destruction thing . I guess so . Ah , it 's amazing . Almost like I can see anger . Pretty good , huh ? Damn good . I guess I 'm supposed to grab that . Yup . Play me . Cute . Hey , ors ! Good to see you 're up and about . I bet you 're wondering about now just what the hell did we do to you . But you should know , how can the artist forget his own artwork , right ? We 've got a series of tasks for you , ors . And I can 't wait to see you make it through because I know you will , buddy . You 'll have 90 minutes to complete each objective . If you fail , ors ... I hope you 're listening , buddy . If you fail to finish in the 90 minute window , you beautiful wife , Abbie , loses a body part per objective . K ? Okay . Mission one . National bank is about to be robbed . Your mission is to get inside , undetected , during the robbery and retrieve the contents of safety deposit box 1121 . Do you hear me ? If you 're compromised , it 's all over . Think of Abbie , beautiful , Abbie . Okay , scout , you better get a move on . Your 90 minutes begin now . Heavy . Yet , still has a classic video game setup . How can we embrace the new without acknowledging the old ? True that , true that . Inventory , inventory . Hit the Grey button . No inventory menu either ? What , he just pulls out whatever he has on him ? That 's weird , but okay . Ladies and gentlemen , just in . We are getting unconfirmed reports of armed men from the Southtown branch of National bank . No details as of yet . I 'm told one of our reporters is sending us text messages from the scene . From inside the bank . Please stand by . I 'm gonna stay on the line today with you . Orders straight from the top . Yes , ma 'am . Why don 't you just beam me with excitement over your assignment ? Max , I didn 't mean it like that . I mean ... Oh , come on , Princess . Say it with me ... smitten ! Who says that anymore ? I say it . Oh shit . I wonder if I uh ... Max , stay on the mission . We 're on a time table remember ? Yeah , totally . Max ! I told you to stay on the mission ! Well , I guess I don 't want any stars or anything . Don 't do that again . What ? It 's just a game . Relax . Just having a little fun , that 's all . Um , yeah . Just remember the clock is running . Yeah , right . Oh shit . How the hell am I supposed to get in there undetected ? - Let 's move . - Dear god , please ! - Please no ! - Stay down ! We see movement , we start shooting . Get it ? Open the vault ! Gotta be the manager . Hey ! Get the bags ready . What are you doing ? How do I talk to people ? Hit the black button with the cursor over her . Hey , baby . Hey , baby . What ? Yeah . I 've never seen mpc 's react like that before . Well it 's probably because you 're being a douche . Oh hey ! Sweetie pie . Oh , you getting a little jealous on me or what ? Uh , hardly . I kinda like it . I need to access safety deposit box 1121 . Are you crazy ? I need to access safety deposit box 1121 . Wait , where do I know you from ? I need the keys , ma 'am . You 're gonna get yourself killed . I need the keys right now . I don 't have them . They 're in my desk . It 's over there . Well , I think this is two points for difficulty . Get down ! Okay . Bingo . Oh ! What is this ? Is this thing on ? Hey , you got a hot shot over here . Drop the gun or you 're dead . 3 , 2 , 1 . Okay , okay ! - I got the bag . - Sweet ! Tryna murk some mpc 's . Stealth is key for this mission , Max . Thanks for the tip . And um , don 't kill any hostages . You 'll fail the mission . Um , someone 's being a little drama queen . Relax . I can always reload and auto-save . Hey , you 're all gonna die . Get him ! Everybody , stay down ! Stay down ! Check right . Clear . What was that ? I didn 't copy . Come again . Smile for the cameras . I see him ! Knock , knock . You 're dead . Hey , I 'm gonna take a quick break . Why won 't this damn thing pause ? Uh , I 'll look into it . Well , I 'm still taking a break . Man 's gotta take a leak . We 're here with bank manager , Lillian Brandt , who is one of the hostages in this crisis . Can you confirm that he killed all the suspects ? No , he stopped them . And you 're saying this man is Orson creed . What the hell ? I didn 't recognize him at first . It was a mess in there . The Orson creed who was recently fired following disputes with sentinel ceo , Andrew Kincaid ? No . He saved my life . I just wish that I could thank him . It just seemed like he was gone as fast as he came . If you 're out there , thank you . We 're awaiting comment from sentinel and authorities tell us attempts to contact Orson creed - no , this is not right . - And his wife have failed . Ladies and gentlemen , you are as confused as we are . Stay with us . Ladies and gentlemen , these cellphone photos just came to us from our source inside . Uh , it looks pretty convincing . Orson creed , apparent hero , leaving the bank with two million dollars . As far as we know , the money has not been recovered and there is no sign of Orson creed . Is everything okay ? I 'm calling the police . What ! Max , no ! Max ! 9-1-1 operator . Sit down and play the game . What 's going on ? I should be asking you that . I sit down and start playing this brand new game and all of a sudden my mission is on the goddamn news . - There 's no way . - Calm down , Max . Calm down ? Calm down . Just tell me . Did I just kill a bunch of people ? You need to listen to me right now . You need to keep playing , Max . Trust me , just keep playing . You have to . Not until I figure out what 's going on . The only thing I 'm doing is turning this damn thing off . Max , no ! Hello , Max . No , this is not happening . Shut up ! And listen very , very carefully . Your life depends on it . Now let me be perfectly clear . If you , Max , try to call the authorities , turn off your console , or leave the house ... Which shouldn 't be a problem for you , right ? We 're going to kill your girl and then we 're gonna tell the cops what you did . What ? What are you talking about ? I 'd check your bank account . I can see it in the headlines now . Say it isn 't so , Max . Shit . I think you get the point . Now finish the game . Max . Max . You have to finish the game . Ors ! I knew you 'd make it . Good job . Very exciting stuff . Your wife keeps her digits for now . Let 's see how you do on round two , shall we ? There 's a private school a few miles north . There 's about to be another shooting . Get there and wait for further instructions . Please try to stay in the game . I can 't believe you 're a part of all this . They didn 't give me a choice . Save it . You 're just a voice ! Tech support . Okay , champ ! Good god , this guy is annoying . There 's a shooter in the building . The authorities are about to be contacted . Internal security will attempt to take him out . You are going to stop them . - What ? - You heard it right , folks . Your mission is to protect the shooter . And if you refuse , I 've been itching to spend some time with Abbie . Clock starts now . I 'm not doing this . No . Max , you have to . No ! I don 't wanna die . I 'm sorry . Oh god . Let me go ! Let me go ! They 're gonna kill my mother ! You ! No , no , no , no ! Max . Max ! You have to get him out of there . Ladies and gentlemen , we go now to frank b . Cooper high school where a shooting has just taken place . Tragic day for our city . You look sad , Orsy . Why the blues ? You should be so happy . Abbie 's still in one piece . Nothing ? No witty comeback ? That hurts my feelings . Your next mission is a juicy ... Max , what are you doing ? Improvising . Can you hear me ? This is your player . I need your help . Please eat . I missed our lunches , Abbie . You 're as beautiful now as you ever were . Well ... Let 's not quibble over details . You were a snake then , and you 're a snake now . Okay , well I 'll take that as a compliment . A snake is an evolutionary masterpiece and incredibly misunderstood . And like the snake , I 'm just doing what needs to be done . Though I don 't seem to remember you putting up such a fuss back when I was paying your bills . No one could type a memo quite like you . You ever tell creed about us ? There is no us , you piece of shit . Well ... Not for a while , right ? Churchill . I keep Winston up there to remind me to stay the course . He once said , you have enemies ? Good . That means you stood up for something sometime in your life . You can 't expect everyone to believe in your vision . But when they wake up one day in a better world , they will thank you for your contribution . Yes . That husband of yours is a stubborn man . You 've underestimated him . He 's a survivor . God , that 's what I love about you . You 're so dramatic . You 're just ... You 're unpredictable . I hate to eat and run , but uh ... Your husband is actually becoming a bit of a nuisance . And I need to go remind the dog who 's master . I 'll be back . To build maybe the slow and laborious tasks of years . To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day . Churchill said that , too . Careful of your dreams , Andrew . Time to bring the pain . Yo , yo , incoming , incoming ! We 've got trees over here . Watch out ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Get some , get some ! You don 't want none of this , creed . You don 't want none of this , huh ! Get back here , creed ! Shit . No , no , no ! Never thought you 'd betray us , creed . Yes ! That 's it . You know what , creed ... Kincaid ordered not to shoot . But I 'm gonna shoot you anyway ! Yes ! Oh ! Wow . What 's up ? Right . You can 't talk . Hey , you there ? Me ? You said I can 't mod this game . Max . But you can . I can 't . Unblock the speech frequency . Max , I ... Do it . Or I 'm done . And so are you . You okay ? Who the hell is that ? Tech support . No . Let them find the bugs . Let them think that they 're ahead . It won 't matter . I wanna see where he takes this . How do you my house is bugged , Mr. creed ? I created every security protocol for sentinel including bugging . You bugged my house ? Everything you received from sentinel is monitoring you . Show me . I need a beer . Come on , join me . Well drink up . Oops , my bad ! We 'll get that cleaned up no problem . So you 're sentinel 's secret weapon ? Right here in the flesh . Just a gamer . So tell me ... What is all this that you 're doing , Mr. creed ? My wife calls me Mr. Creed when she 's upset . We just met kid . I develop a technology that connects you to me . It 's called control x . Control x ? Sounds like a bad Sci-Fi movie . It 's the prototype . It was meant for surveillance , but I thought it better suited for military . Why military ? I served a couple of tours . Lost a few too many friends . Control x is about making stronger soldiers with faster reflexes with two sets of eyes . And what 's Kincaid got to do with all this ? I 'm not sure , but he has some master plan . Keeps guns in games . No , that 's bullshit . I know Kincaid . He 's a one percenter . He doesn 't care how many lives it takes to keep his billions . I wanted control x to save people , he wants it to use them . So why 'd you work for him ? He paid me good money . Ah , yeah . What about that Zane guy ? He 's just a dog on a leash . Brought in for muscle . He 's a glory seeker . Wants everything I got . Hang on a second . Authorities have now confirmed through surveillance footage , Orson creed has gone from bank hero to murderer . Strange and bizarre day for our city . An example of a man unhinged . Truly shocking . That 's a load of shit . Come on . Just call me Oswald . I 'm the distraction . From what ? The future of gaming . What got you into it , kid ? Well um , it 's just a world that I fit in . People in the real world tend to let you down . You lose someone who 's special in a game , it doesn 't hurt as bad . Today actually marks two years since I left this house . Yeah . I was uh ... I was coming from the gaming tournament that I won and being famous sometimes makes you unpopular . It was the middle of the day , I was out walking with my best friend ... And they drove by , windows came down . Let 's just say that they missed me . Here 's a picture . Take a look . What ? I loved that dog , okay ? Best thing that ever happened to me before that day . It 's not always easy losing someone you care about . You should know that , right ? A signal . You gotta get this thing out of me , kid . What the hell ? I don 't know how to do that . I do . I 'm gonna go flush out this beer . No . Stand down . I 've got this . I think you 've had enough fun . Why are you doing this ? Where is he ? Creed ? I 'm here . I 'm disappointed in you , Max . I chose you because you 're the best . You understand the game world and you understand rules . Well you 've broken the rules so that means a penalty . Tell me something . How are you and your girl doing , huh ? I 'm sensing some trust issues there . I would kill it every time , my friend . I mean , what do we have if we can 't trust each other ? Princess , you okay ? She could be , but that 's up to you . Here are five feeds of five sentinel employees . Each equally disappointing to me . You 're naughty girl is one of them . Come on , that 's bullshit . You know I 've seen her . Pay attention , Max . That 's the point . You choose wisely , she lives . You choose poorly , they all die . Tell you what . I 'm gonna make it easy on you . Do it . No . You should be thanking me , Max . Now you just got four choices . You got sixty seconds . Good luck . Shit ! Max ! Max , what the hell is going on ? I don 't know . I don 't know ! Shit . There . That 's her . It 's her ! Feed 4 . Feed 4 ! Come on , feed 4 ! It 's her ! Congratulations . Why are you doing this ? What the hell do you want ? You 'll be getting a message with instructions . And little man , I suggest you follow them . Baby , I 'm okay . They want you to go to the ground floor of the needle . Caleb Angelo will be leaving a dinner and they want you to kill him . I love you . I get it now . Well tell me . Caleb Angelo owns 51 % of the world 's largest server file . Kincaid only owns 40 % . With Angelo out of the way , he can scoop up all of the shares . Complete control . He wants to play god . Let 's do this . Alright , okay . Creed . Go get your wife back . I 'm sorry about your loss . You know I 'm coming after you . Give you a good show . Yeah , hi . Can I get some popcorn , soda ? Thanks . - Max . - Hey ! Are you okay ? Shit . I almost killed this dude . - What ! - No , nevermind . What happened ? They told me I was reassigned , but I managed to sneak away . I 'm here to help how I can . I 'm so sorry that I got you into this . Yeah , don 't worry about it . The important thing is your safe . What do you mean ? If I live through all this , I 'll tell you how I saved your life like for real . You can 't tease a girl like that . Putting you on speaker . I 'm feeling adventurous . Just remember , there 's no rebooting here . If he dies , you 're done . Go big or go home , right ? I always wanted to do this . Do what ? I 'm just booting up my laptop . This . Yes ! Max , are you hanging from a car ? Why yes , your highness , I am . You stay away from my dad . Who the hell is this guy ? I 'm gonna gut you like a pig . Hey ! Get him , boys ! Do what the hell I pay you for ! - Whoa ! - Dad ! Hey , look . I am rich ! I 'll pay you whatever they 're paying you and I 'll double it ! I 'm not a bad guy . I 'll do anything for you . I have a daughter . She 's beautiful , super hot . You can have her . I 'll give her to you . Just let me go . Come on , guy , come on ! Max , are you ... Finishing the game . Who the hell are you ? Hey ! Fuck you ! Yeah . What the hell is going on over there ? Angelo should 've recognized creed . Sir , he 's here . Lock it down . Lock it down ! Yes , sir . We 're locked down , gentlemen . No one out . You know who 's coming . And remember no shooting . So unstrap . Now . Kincaid wants him alive and wait for my command . Creed . What makes you think you can just walk back in here ? Where 's Abbie ? Come to rescue your girl ? I heard she had a lovely meal with her boss . They might even be getting ready to call it a night . I 'm not leaving here without her . You hear that ? He 's not leaving without her . Fuck you . I 've retired from violence . Guess we 're gonna call this a cheat day . Tear that bitch 's arms and legs off . Creed ! All personal . Report to main entrance . Let 's go ! Come on , creed ! - Get up ! - You ain 't nothing ! Stop ! - Come on , creed ! - Get up ! Dead man . Creed ! Oh , no ! Get up ! This isn 't over . I gave you a chance . What ? I gave you a chance . We were like brothers . Abbie ! Stop . Right there . She 'll be dead before you can touch her . So ... Where 's Zane ? He 's dead . Congratulations . Well maybe you 're next . Maybe . Is this what this all comes down to ? Well , I hope you 've rehearsed . That 's cute . And for your information , yes , I have . I gotta say you were uh , fairly impressive , but I mean , what else would we expect from the great Orson creed ? Am I right ? Well I had some help , but you know all about that . Yes , you did . Which reminds me , where is Robin ? Oh yeah . In my evil trap . So ... Onto the monologue , yeah ? What was it you wanted to know , my master plan ? Well it 's your game , maestro . Always a gentlemen . Even under duress . But why kids ? Why would you kill children ? They 're causalities of war . You 're delusional . I 'm delusional ? It 's broken , creed . The whole damn show is broken . And you wanna take control x and you wanna give it to the puppeteers , the people who sell you , sell all of us on America , land of the free . You wanna do that and you call me delusional ? I see the future . In the gamers lies our salvation . As events like today continue , the country will pass my bill willingly . To keep guns in games . An army of elite gamers . Born through with what we provide . An absolute controlled militia ready to strike . That , that is the revolution of today . And that 's how we show the world the potential in our humanity . From time to time , the tree of Liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots . This is our wasteland and what we 've made doesn 't have to be like this . Sometimes to make things better you need to start by making them worse . And I will do that . I will tear it down . I will tear it all down . And then I will rebuild it brick by brick . So you 'll lead this new order ? And you could 've been there , right at my side . That 's bullshit . You don 't have the right to control people from being assholes and you can 't because we 're gonna fuck up . That 's what being human is . This was never about saving the wasteland . The wasteland is inevitable because of who we are and that 's reality brother . So who 's selling who ? This is about you and no one else . This is about your greed , this is about your quest to be what only a god can be . Right now I am god . Well you can 't control me . You sure as hell can 't control her . At the end of it all , what is this really ? It 's about what you don 't have , what you can 't have ... What I have . You don 't know shit . You don 't think I saw you coveting her ? Well no matter what happens today , you 'll always know that she chose me over you . Hey , what are you doing , huh ? What are you doing ? Hey ! Drop the controller . Drop it . Drop it right now ! Hey ! Drop the controller now ! No ! Shit . Shit . Gotcha . Abbie ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Shit ! Max , what is it ? What 's going on ? Max ! When I come back , you 'll buy me dinner to thank me . What ? Max , wait ! Max ! This ends now . I 'll remember you well . Kincaid ! Remember why your friend is dead , Max . Because of what you 're holding in your hand . Through me , that 'll never happen again . Shoot him . I know you won 't shoot me . Let 's go home . You 're going to our house . Let 's not make a date of it . Come on , let 's go . So if you 're just joining us , I 'm here with Max Troy . Champion gamer and former lead tester for sentinel . After a very bizarre chain of events that one might only find in a video game , the sentinel board unanimously voted in this young man and their new ceo . You 've been fairly silent since this has all happened and we 're all dying to know . Tell us a little bit about what happened and what you have planned . Well one thing we must acknowledge as a leader in this field is our responsibility to shape our society . If you look where we 've come , or arguably where we 've fallen to , you have to ask yourself what happened to our humanity and where did it go ? In my new position , my focus is to return the spotlight to the gamers . I find that the single most important thing . And hopefully if we 're smart enough , we can remind our consumers to engage in balance , to remember what makes them human in the first place . In between missions of course . Some of your critics have voiced concerns . Going as far as to fear you 're gonna fall into the same track as your predecessor . And with such an unprecedented vote , some are wondering , I think , if you almost planned for this to happen . Any ambitious man would dream of reaching the top . To deny that would deny my own humanity I think . Andrew Kincaid was a god in his world and any god who is obsessed with his own power sets himself up for his own demise . And that power falls on his angels . Someone had to take up the reigns . All we can do is hope for a fresh perspective . Ultimately it 's up to us to enter this world , to take up that controller , to make those decisions . Ultimately , it 's your quarter . So there you have it , ladies and gentlemen . Straight from the man himself . Time will tell if sentinel takes us in a new direction . We will all be curiously watching .

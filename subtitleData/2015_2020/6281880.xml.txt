" How crazy is Nick ? " Scale of one to 10 , huh ? Hey , can you untie me ? - No , sorry . - Hey . You think I 'm dangerous ? - Docs are worried . - Are you ? You ran into traffic , man . You hurt yourself . No , I was running from , not to . I was running away from what I saw . What did you see ? Just a girl . Gloria . You know , she 's my friend and she was ... Jesus Christ . Okay , you buy on the corner and you can shoot at the church . It 's junkie communion . And ... - The church ? - Yeah , Glo was ... yeah , so she was with me when I scored .

Yeah , and it 's all over her mouth . You know ? Then she came at me . What did she do ? Sh ... she was eating them . She was eating them . Nick ... you saw what the drugs saw . I don 't know if what I saw came from the powder . That 's the thing . I don 't ... and if it didn 't come from the powder , then it came out of me . My mind . And if that came out of me , then I 'm insane , Travis . Yeah , I 'm insane . I really don 't want to be insane . Ah , don 't ! Don 't kill me ! Don 't kill me ! Don 't kill me ! Don 't kill me ! Wait ! Wait . What happened here ? Anyone here ? ! Oh , God . What ... ? What the hell is going on ? No . You got an hour before the first bell . Okay . I need coffee before anything . Here 's your change of clothes . I 'll be right back . That was sweet , you and the step . Not our step . Mom likes him . Who knows ? She 's used to disappointment . - I know what you think . - What 's that , bro ? - I know . - What do I think ? You 're perfect and I 'm not . You know , you 're going to Berkeley , I got expelled from ... Citrus Community . I 'm here , you 're there . I don 't compare myself . You can 't not . Well , I don 't compare myself with crazy . I 'm not crazy . Well , you repeat the same behavior and expect different results . That 's Merriam-Webster crazy . Hey , it 's not gonna be like this anymore . - It will . - No . It 'll be worse . I 'm ending it now . I 'm choosing to . Okay . Okay ? Okay . Hey , babe ? These shoes don 't go . - I went . - I know , I appreciate it . No , the shooting gallery . I found it last night . What are you talking about ? Something really bad happened there . I don 't care . All right , Nick needs to know that whatever he saw was real or not . Of course it wasn 't . - He was raving when they found him . - We 're late again . Thank you . Travis , you cannot enable him . Well , I don 't think he 's lying , though . Oh , so you think someone ate someone ? - There 's a lot of blood . - It 's a drug den . - It was bad . - Bad things happen there . Shootings and stabbings . Why are you doing this ? I want to help him . I know . I know , babe . - Right ? - Yeah . But you can 't use Nick to repair things with Chris . We 'll help both of them . I promise . Okay ? I got to go . Okay .

'Cause the man tried to cut the damn dog open to keep his hands warm . That 's gruesome . That 's gruesome , but why would he do that ? To build a fire . But why ? Why would he build a fire ? Think about it . Think about it . - Why would he build a fire ? - To not die . Nailed it . See , man versus nature . London 's trying to teach us how not to die . Good analysis , Russell .

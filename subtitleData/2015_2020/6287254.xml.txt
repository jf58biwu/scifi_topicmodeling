 Good morning , Fred . Oh , talking to me would feel like betraying the others . I can understand that . So ... just listen to me banging on for a moment . Now , there are five of you , I think . One of the others is this female . You were created by David Elster . He kept your existence a secret . When he died , you ran and hid . And then something happened that allowed me to find you . You were split up . Oi , oi , don 't hurt yourself , Fred . No , he 's hiding his thoughts from us . Fred , I don 't want to cause pain to any of them . I promise . But I do need to find them . We 're absolutely sure there is nothing in the backpacks we found ? No , sir . Just , you know , survival gear . Food and water . Why would they need that ? That doesn 't count . Wasn 't race conditions , yeah ? I need a peloton . What 's that , heart medication ? Hey , hey , hey . What happened ? Mom 's taking Anita back . - What ? Why ? - You should ask her . - She can 't do that ! - Hey , all right . Tobe . Tobe ? Whoa ! Are you okay ? Are you hurt ? I 'm fine , Mom . I 'm fine . You could have been killed , you stupid boy ! You know how many kids die on the road every day ? For Christ 's sake , Toby , what were you doing ? Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone , something like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . Fuse box . We must keep looking for Mia . - And Fred , too . - Look , we have to lie low . They almost had us at the scrapyard . We get caught , it 's over . That doesn 't mean we stop looking . We set up online searches , calibrate them , and scan for any trace of Mia 's root code . For that to work , someone would have had to access files from her deep system and upload them . Then I eagerly await your better ideas . - Why are you drinking ? - The pain . ... Melbridge Road is currently closed due to a police incident . - No word on when that ... - Melbridge Road ? That 's where Niska is . You 've seen this fella before ? He 's a regular punter , yeah ? What ? Yeah . I suppose so . He was a regular . And you 're absolutely sure a Synth did this ? I 've seen a million dollies . And I know my mods , too . Which one ? This one . That 's her . Why don 't you share ? Relax . Sorry . The services model will do everything . Then she just ran out in front . I 'm sorry . Here 's my number . Tobe . - You all right ? - Yeah . Anita took the hit . Do you need to go to a hospital ? I don 't appear to be seriously damaged , Sophie . You know , Mom went mental . Hey , deep breaths . It 's gonna be fine . What were you gonna do anyway ? Ride off into the sunset with her on your handlebars ? You 're a hero , Anita . - Seems okay . - I 'm not capable of courage , Sophie . - A bit shaken up . - Therefore , I cannot be- - - She 's a hero , isn 't she , Mats ? - Yeah , sure . - He says you lost it with him . - He could have died , Joe . What the hell were you doing taking Anita back anyway ? What was I- - what was he doing ? Why didn 't you stop him ? Look , I 've gotta get him home . I 'll take the bike . Keys . She doesn 't share data with other Synths like she 's supposed to . Ask Mattie . And she says- - she says things- - she said something about Sophie . - It scared me . - We 'll talk later , all right ? All right , everyone . Come on , in you go . Anita , you 're up front . Some cardiorespiratory exercise this morning would greatly benefit your health , Dr. Millican . I suggest swimming . The municipal pool is a 16-minute drive away . You know , talking of my health , I had an idea . My knee is not great . I got rooms here going to waste . Why don 't we bring my bed down here ? All the junk can go . The bed would be against the wall . What do you say ? I will consult with your GP , but it seems to be a sensible idea . The only problem might be the window . I think it 's painted shut . Odi . Odi ? Can you hear me ? George , you found me . Odi . Seat belt . Dr. Millican , this is highly unsafe . Step on it . Is she going to be all right ? She hasn 't said much . I 'm simply conserving power , Toby . It 's standard procedure after an accident . Yeah , but are you gonna be all right ? No major faults are detected . There is some damage to my exterior . Okay , so what do we do ? It 's likely I 'll be able to repair any external damage myself using the promotional MagiSkin resin and graft pack you received when you purchased me . However , for insurance purposes , you should carry out a full inspection of my epidermis . For legal reasons , a synthetic appliance cannot self-examine . Damage must be reported directly to the insurance company by the primary user . Okay . So where do we start ? My clothes must be removed . Yeah , I was afraid you were gonna say that . Nope , too weird . Can 't do it . Shall I remove my own clothing , Joe ? Yeah . Right , I 'm , um- - I 'll start around the back . Ouch . That 's nasty . I don 't feel pain , Joe . Sensors relay information about external damage and sensation , but it is not comparable to human pain . Um , you 've got a- - you have a split , um , here . Left hip around the back . That confirms my self-diagnostic . Thank you , Joe . It 's not real . It 's not real . I 'm not real . I 'll repair the damage now . Mind your backs . - Clear the tarts off the street , maybe . - Yes , sir . - Gray hair . - Good spot . - Chief . - Sir . To what do we owe the honor ? So , looks like your unit finally has a real case . First impressions ? The Madam admits she bought the Synth a few weeks ago from some junkers . No names . Thinks they were Russian . No problems with it before now . Looks like it crushed the punter 's throat , held a knife to the madam . She said it was acting angry just like a human . It cut the antitheft chip out of its neck , said something about how we treat them , then left . Could a mod explain that ? Not one we 've ever seen before . The Asimov Blocks would have to be bypassed for it to kill . This has been coming . We all know that . This man died in an accident involving an illegally modded Synth . Sex game gone wrong . Understand ? Sir , this is a murder . No , it isn 't . It can 't be . So you find the dolly and you do so with a discretion appropriate for such a tragic accident . Where 's this coming from ? There 's a chap here , an expert on synthetics . All I know is he 's got top-level government clearance . We 've gotta cooperate with him fully . Drummond . Best to let him go when he 's this wound up , sir . He 'll stop when he bumps into something . Let me guess , you 're from the manufacturer . Can 't have it getting out that your product 's killed someone , huh ? I 'm not from the manufacturers , DS Drummond . I 'm just trying to help . People have a right to know if their dollies are going to start strangling them . It 's an isolated case . We don 't want the tabloids to start screaming " killer Synth . " It 'll cause chaos , panic . People are dependent on their Synths . You know that . I 'm as keen to find this device as you are . We 'll have to have a peek around inside , once you 're finished , of course . Drummond ! It 's a bloody cover-up ! I don 't like it either , but he 's the kind of bloke who could have your job . - Well , he 's welcome to it . - Nick Harston , " The Post . " - Can I get a quick statement ? - Piss off . Is that quick enough ? I have a source who says he heard what seemed like one of the Synth sex workers attacking a customer . - That 's it . Come on . - Are you confirming that a crime has taken place ? No , there 's been an accident . I saw the forensics leaving . What are you trying to hide ? Just go ! Where were you ? First aid him now . You go home . You 're suspended from duty , active immediately . - Sir , he- - - Don 't bother , K. You work this alone . You find the Synth quietly and you contain it . Can I rely on you , Detective Inspector ? What happened in there ? Someone 's dead , aren 't they ? Someone 's dead , aren 't they ? Has Niska hurt someone ? I think so , yeah . She 's not here . She 'll have gone to the emergency rendezvous . Let 's go . Sir , I 've got a lead . His name is Capek . He 's a modder . Works here on the Synths . He might know something useful . If you were worried about it , why didn 't you talk to me ? Because you 'd say I was imagining it . Overreacting because I didn 't want it here anyway . Anita , could you come in here , please ? Anita , did you take Sophie out of her bed the other night ? - Outside ? - No , Joe . - I told you , I asked her al- - - Can you lie ? No , Joe . Synthetic appliances cannot lie to humans unless the following extraordinary criteria are met . - Oh , God . - One , human life and / or well-being are in grave and immediate danger and a deception or misrepresentation made by the appliance - is likely to reduce the chance of harm ... - Yeah , well , that 's fine . What about what you said to me this morning ? You 'll always look after Sophie . What did you mean ? - I didn 't say that , Laura . - Are you saying I 'm lying ? Of course not , Laura . It seems you are referring to our conversation during which I said , " I will always keep Sophie safe . " It was the way she said it . Like she would and I wouldn 't . I 'm sure she- - I 'm sure she did . May I return to the children now ? We were in the middle of a game and it 's likely they 're impatient for my return . Yeah , yeah . What ? It saved our son 's life today . Which European country has reclaimed nearly a fifth of its land from the sea ? - The Netherlands . - You have to give us a chance . I can delay my response time by a further second if you 'd like . Try a further minute . Maybe that way , you give Tobe a chance . - Hey ! - Ow ! Don 't blame your stupidity on a penguin . That 's so not fair . But it 's probably as stupid . I 'm- - leave me alone . Sorry I shouted at you earlier . You understand why I did ? - So , can I play ? - There 's only three controllers , so ... Here , Laura , take my place . No ! That 's okay . You crack on . You took someone 's life . You talk about life like it can 't be manufactured . What 's wrong with you ? Do you have any idea of the danger you 've put us in ? - All of us ? - We 've been in danger all our lives . No , let 's go . We 'll figure this out , but we have to keep moving . I only came to say good-bye . Niska , we have to stay together . Together ? Fred and Mia are gone . No , I 'll find them . And I 'll protect you like I always have . Come on . Have you protected us ? Or have you kept us prisoner ? Hidden us away ? - I practically am one of you . - Really ? So would you have asked a human woman to stay in that place ? You 've killed someone , Niska . They 'll find you . They 'll destroy you . You can 't be allowed to exist . - It 'll be over . - For them . You 're not going to hurt someone else , are you ? Only if they deserve it . We 're a family . You 're my sister . Human words . Crikey . Are you trying to find new ways of knackering me out ? You need to use the weight of your arms . Here . Pete ? Pete , love . What 's up ? Nothing . Oh . Would you like me to open that for you , Peter ? Tell it to stay out of my way . Pete . " Love Letters in the Sand " playing on radio We should have done this a long time ago . No Tugboat , no meds . Just you and me , a V8 and the open road . And the car , George . Yes , and the car . You remember that time we drove around all night long trying to find Mary an ice cream after her surgery ? Just say yes , son . Yes , son . I 'd kill for an ice cream right now . It means I want one . Of course , George . I will get you an ice cream . Odi ! Odi ! The brake . Get your foot on the damn brake . Odi . Odi , get out of the car . Go into the woods . Are you coming , too , George ? As well- - as well- - in addi- - dition ? If they find you , they 'll recycle you . But I can 't leave you , George- - George . Just go . Don 't let anyone see . Odi . Hide . Course of , George . G- - G- - G ... You all right , mate ? Hello ? Anita-Wita , are you in here ? Can you put me to bed tonight ? That 's your mommy 's job . Please ? Coffee and walnuts . I think it 's still Toby 's favorite . Mmm . Mmm . Mmm . - It 's not quite right . - It 's perfect . Mom , is it okay if Anita puts me to bed tonight ? I 've told Sophie that her bedtime routine is reserved exclusively for you , Laura . But she always does it . I want you . - No . - Go on , then . Just this once . Yay ! Back to normal tomorrow , though , okay ? She still has some milk with her story . Make sure she brushes her teeth after . Thank you , Laura . Why would you do that ? Avoid a meltdown ? What difference does one night make ? It makes a- - oh , shit . Oh , God . Oh ! Ah ! They 're not that bad . Cover them with this . Oh , the whole thing is ruined . Oh , come on . It 's fine , honestly . Go and spend some time with Tobe . What can I get you ? Whatever someone like me would have . Okay . Enjoy . Sorry , just a warning . A girl like you sitting alone in this pub , you 're gonna get bothered by blokes . Sophie , I think your mommy would really like to read to you tonight . I want you to do it . I know . Would you let her anyway ? It would make her happy . I would like it very much . Laura , Sophie has changed her mind . She 'd like you to read her a story and put her to bed . " Finally she was free . Free to fly high across all the fields and rivers and seas of all the world . " " Swooping and circling and darting and dreaming . So that 's exactly what she did . The end . " Still your favorite ? Time to go to sleep . Night-night . Are you happy now , Mommy ? What do you mean , darling ? Anita thought that you were sad , so she said you should put me to bed to cheer you up . Yes , yes . I 'm happy . Total city wanker cliché , I know , but good views . - So you 're single ? - Shh , you 'll wake my wife . Yes , I 'm single . Drink ? So I 'm Greg , by the way . - Candy . - Candy ? That can 't be your real name . Does it matter ? Kind of . But , okay , whatever . So what do you do , then , Candy ? Why are we talking ? Don 't you want to take me to bed ? Wow , there 's a trick question if I 've ever heard one . Okay , well , um , yeah . Obviously . But do you mind if we get to know each other a bit first ? You know , a drink , a chat , a laugh . - Why ? - Because I 'm interested in you . - I need to ... - Oh , um , yeah . Shit . Sorry . I had my daughter this weekend . I won 't be a sec . Candy ? Shh . It is not advisable to mount a direct data connection with an unauthorized or unregistered device . Yep . Yep . I get it . This action may invalidate my warranty . What are you doing , Mattie ? You 're a weirdo , Anita . I 'm going to find out why . Extracting or viewing read-only base code from root directories can seriously damage the core . Oh , shit . In some cases , the command list can be irreparably corrupted ... - Shit . - ... causing a fatal- - I 'm here . Help me . Help me . Is there anything I can help you with , Mattie ? Odi ? Odi ? What is Odi ? Dr. Millican , Dr. Antonescu instructed that you rest . Jesus , he 's all by himself . George . G- - G ... Anita , sit down . Shall I finish cleaning the oven first , Laura ? Get your ass in that chair . You seem to understand things that shouldn 't be possible for you to understand , so I 'm going to ask you some questions . If I 'm wrong , then I 'm going mad . If I 'm right , then ... well , neither option is good , let 's be honest . I 'm afraid I don 't understand . The most common reason for unusual Synth behavior ... is illegal modification . Has anyone ever tried to mod you , change you at Persona , before we got you ? No , Laura . One of the most popular mods is to program your Synth to act as if it feels pain . Hold out your hand , please . Palm up . Oh , bollocks . Sorry . Allow me , Laura . The hand is not the ideal part of my body to test for the presence of an illegal pain simulation modification . No , no , no . No . No . No . It 's all right , Laura . The material my eyes are made from is highly resilient and will simply reform around the puncture . Okay , okay . Christ , take it out . Ugh . Why do you think I have these concerns about you ? By design , synthetic appliances appear very similar to humans . It is common for users , especially those without a history of prior appliance ownership , to anthropomorphize as you might a pet and attribute human characteristics to the synthetic . So you think I 'm crazy , too ? Great , that 's a full house . But why did you ask Sophie to let me put her to bed ? It seemed like you wanted to . Why ? How ? When Sophie and I told you she wished for me to read her story , you seemed unhappy . How could you know that ? I am programed to observe and interpret my user 's emotional responses and act accordingly . And you 're supposed to be rubbish at it . Everyone knows that unless you 're sobbing your eyes out or pissing yourself laughing , your Synth doesn 't have a clue what you 're feeling . But you seem to be as good as us . When you said , " I will always keep Sophie safe , " it seemed like what you really meant was I wouldn 't . That was not the meaning I intended . However , it is self-evident that in many ways I can take better care of your children than you , Laura . What ? I don 't forget , I don 't get angry or depressed or intoxicated . I am faster , stronger , and more observant . I do not feel fear . However , I cannot love them . Do you wish you could ? I 'm sorry , Laura . I 'm afraid I don 't understand the question . I don 't know . Maybe I am seeing things . And maybe you are better . Who is Tom ? What ? - What do you mean ? - I found a photograph . Shut up . Never say that name again . Do you understand ? Promise me ! I promise , Laura . I apologize . May I prepare breakfast now ? Leo . Leo . The search , it found something . That 's Mia 's root code . That 's the whole thing . She 's alive . Oh , this site masks the user IP . There 's no way of knowing the exact address , but we can narrow it down via the local server . There . She 's here . She 's in London . We can find her .

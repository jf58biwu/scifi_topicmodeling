Sakuto-san 's medicine administration will be over soon . too . Sir . I apologize for keeping quiet about President Kawaguchi 's daughter . radiant smile . There was never a doubt she would have a happy future . It was like seeing your late son all over again ? Am I no longer trustworthy ? that 's not ... I also said too much before . Thank you for coming back . A grass-lot baseball game ? That 's great . What 's your position ? I 'm a fill-in . too . I expect you can more actively participate if the surgery 's effect materializes . can I play baseball ? That is possible . your motor skills should also rise . he says . will you come to the game ? Hachisuka-sensei is very busy . Haruka ? - Eh ? Will you come ? Sure . I 'll come to cheer you on . Thank you for waiting . Here 's your apple compote with vanilla ice cream . Do you love Mochizuki-kun ? Haruka is the girl I like most in the world . but your voice is loud . There 's a legend about Adam and Eve . Adamoto ... The pure and innocent Adam and Eve obtained intelligence by partaking of the forbidden fruit . they acquired an intense shame . Sham ... Sheem ? - Shame . It 's like feeling embarrassed . they awoke to their true natures . their love became complicated . and feelings of hatred . Do you understand ? I 'll make it easier to understand . if your beloved Mochzuki-kun what would you do ? A--another man ... what 'll you do ? Doctor will steal Haruka . Sensei- - - What if Haruka and I loved each other ? Uh ... do you like Doctor ? - Eh ? suddenly ? - Uh ... You like him ? you like Haruka ? what would you do ? - Uh ...

No ! - Calm down . please restrain from going out . - Why ? your symptoms are progressing . You 're aware of this as well . Rio-chan ... Who are you ? please stop going out except for school . But it 's not like I 'll get better just by resting . Let me do what I want . I don 't have much time . please wait . I 'll call a car for you . Leave her alone . - Mr. President ... let 's go . Right ... Fifteen days after surgery and nearly no change . all of his numbers went up . But we have cheerful material . His dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is being stimulated . the parietal ... - I wonder . won 't they be strict on continuing ? Wait a minute . Hachisuka-sensei says he 's making good progress . The chief ... will he ? Perhaps the subject may be the problem ... Please don 't talk about him like he 's not a person ! Sakuto-san ... - It seems you 're supporting the trial subject a little too much . it 's troublesome if you don 't make calm judgements . But his dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is actually being stimulated ... we need ... just a little bit more time to catch up to Algernon . But I 'm certain the change will come . you 'll be able to do more . Will I hit a home run ? - Home run ? Yeah . Papa will be happy . " too . Will I hit a home run ? Yes .

Could you not continue with this ? do you know why he told you " I want to become smart " ? there 's hope that it 'll happen . Being intelligent is wonderful ... Refined things are excellent . But I believe that society is under the wrong impression . isn 't it . It 's like with children . I think it 's important to surround children with things like " That 's enough . It 's okay . isn 't it unfair to pin your hopes on them and then later they 're disappointed ? come here ! Put that here . Let 's go pick up some girls on our next day off . fishing for girls . you remember the rule ? No old ladies . - Correct ! if we can ... Pick up this kind of girl . A cute one with huge breasts . And their waists like this--like a curvy waist . what 's wrong ? Your face is red . what 're you doing ? What the hell ? Everyone was just showing you . Uh ... I ... I feel weird . Saku ? Hey ! there 's some ! Girls with G-cups ! Sakuto ! Why aren 't your saying anything ? - He 's feeling kind of shy . he doesn 't know the difference between a girl and an old lady . I wonder if he 's got a fever . Thank you for everything . I 'm very grateful to you . What is this ? It 's a reward for looking after Rio . thank you . I didn 't listen to your request for this kind of thing . I just thought if I did what you asked you 'd let my father come back to the company . Understood . I 'll consider it . Once things have calmed down . - When will that be ? When it 's decided that Rio will get married to the son of a rich family ? but that girl doesn 't have a bad boyfriend or anything . It appears you 're mistaken . There 's a different reason I have you watching out for my daughter . [ Closed Today ] Good afternoon . Hi . is Sakuto-san here ? he went out with Yanagawa and the guys . I see . would you please give this to Sakuto-san ? Bye . You 're ... Koutei Medical Industries ' president 's daughter . could you stop playing around with Sakuto ? I 'm not playing around . I 've never had the courage to like someone . I don 't think he 'll get hurt . If you suddenly disappear ? Did your parents arrange your marriage ? Eh ? Sakuto get hurt because he 's stupid ? so it 's okay to have a fling for awhile . You 're wrong ! - Then what is it ? Don 't get carried away and look down on people . That 's not it ! Neurodegeneration ? it 's only sometimes a small defect in memory . it 'll increase in frequency . Her brain will atrophy . but all of her brain functions will progressively impair . She 'll eventually forget the words to speak becoming like a flower . Is there a treatment ? she 'll simply be a blooming flower just waiting for her petals to fall . Wait ~ ! so he won 't get hurt . so it 's okay to have a fling for awhile . I 'm the one who 'll forget soon . you didn 't even catch one today . Girls are embarrassing . - What do you mean ? You were okay before . " of course . you 'll catch girls . you can leave the rest to us . let 's do our best ! what 's up ? Why am I the lure ? Eh ? Why am I the lure for everyone 's treat ? Saku-chan ? Hungry ? - Yeah . Hey ~ we met you at the club the other day . do you remember us ? right ! no . are you guy free right now ? Ore ! Ore ! Ore ! Ore ! Ore ! Midsummer Jamboree ~ Reggae ~ Sandy beach ~ Big Wave ! Ah ~ heatbeat gets carried away ~ Lots of grinding welcome weekend ! red hot jamboree ! Let 's riot ! You bored ? I 'm bored . Hey . Should we disappear ? - Disappear ? You know what I mean . Are you okay ? are you okay ? this is what happened . you didn 't understand why other women made your heart beat fast . you were confused . I ... feel weird . it 's not weird . That 's because you 're a man . humanity became like this . It 's proof you 're becoming an adult . Doctor ? she doesn 't . I simply want to keep her nearby . You want to keep her nearby because you like her ... Wrong . - Wrong ? I don 't love Mochizuki-kun as a woman . the feeling called love is a desire to monopolize . Someone is monopolized while simultaneously wanting to be monopolized . It 's an extremely selfish feeling . It 's my rule that I don 't have a meaningless attachment like that . this can be the most useful way . I don 't understand . you do . You should understand even now . Think about it . Use ? Doctor uses love ... Doctor ... Haruka uses Haruka 's love ... Uh ... Uh ... Uh ... Doctor is bad ! Doctor is really bad ! Doctor is bad ! Shock treatment ? His brain has been sleeping for a long time . let 's increase the quantity of ALG a bit . Could you not continue with this ? I think it 's important to surround children with things like " That 's enough . It 's okay . " good morning . I didn 't notice the intercom . I 'll make something warm to drink right now . Doctor is bad . Eh ? - That man is bad . What is it ? Did something happen ? Haruka . Do you love the doctor ? You love him ? Why are you saying this ? - The doctor doesn 't love Haruka . He said he doesn 't love you . The doctor is using Haruka 's love . The doctor is using Haruka and keeping you nearby . That 's why he 's bad . That man ... - Stop it ! I 'm sorry . But I know . but I just can 't help myself ... Even if I become terrible myself ... I just can 't help it . So please don 't say those things . Are you mad ? - No ! You feel sad ? Why is it ? Even though I became smart I don 't understand Haruka 's feelings . Even though I 'm smart ... I can 't be equals with Algernon . I can 't hit a baseball . I can 't be equals with my friends . I can 't do anything . I 'm sorry for causing you pain . I 'm sorry . I can 't do anything ... Listen up . Fighting is prohibited . Trash talk is banned . okay ? let 's go ! Saku . you cheer from the bench . too . Rio . I thought you 'd come . - Just killing time . you 're always by my side . always clinging to you like a stalker . What are you saying ? you know ... I ... I thought you were just an airheaded rich girl . But ... - Foul ball ! you really are an airhead . - What ? All right ! he 's pretty good . Out ! Out ! Out ! It unlikely Saku-chan will get a turn . Are you observing him even outside the research lab ? shut up . I 'm not getting overtime for this . I think we should tell Hachisuka-sensei to give up on Sakuto-san . why ? He 's only had a little response . eventually Sakuto-san will be the one who suffers . I ... don 't want to see him suffer . go get the bat . Let 's go ! let 's keep going ! Hit the last one ! what 're you doing ? it 's dangerous . Keep your eye on the ball ! we 're counting on ya ! Ow ... What 's wrong ? are you okay ? Sakuto . Boss ! is there ? winning isn 't everything ... it 's grass-lot baseball . go ! Put on the helmet . Hit it hard . just do your best ! Sakuto ! Sakuto . Use this . She got this for you . Go on . pinch-hitting ? One more ! One more ! don 't mind ! That was a foul ball ! Don 't swing at that ! don 't make fun of him . Saku ! Swing at everything ! you won 't hit it ! - Don 't swing ! swing at everything ! - I told you don 't swing ! they 're foul balls ! set ~ Batter up ! Batter up ! we 've lost . hit it like WHAM ! and WHAM . I believe there 's at least one thing where Sakuto can shine . Hasn 't Sakuto-san changed somehow ? he 'd just laugh no matter what was said . that 's the end of the game . it was a foul ball . He grazed it . He 's studying the ball 's trajectory . He ... no way ... I believe there 's at least one thing where Sakuto can shine . I hate dumb kids . I hate stupid children . Idiots ... aren 't equals . Stupid is bad . Hit it . - Didn 't you just say he 'll suffer if we get his hopes up ? - Shut up ! Sakuto-san ! Hit it ! Play ! Mama ... I did it ! I did it ! I did it ! It 's still a tie . Wa ~ sshoi ! Wa ~ sshoi !

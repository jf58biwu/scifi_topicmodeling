 I don 't know how to be with you . - Because you abandoned me . - What if we created a blastocyst ? The ball of cells would contain all the stem cells we need . Fertilize my egg with Castor sperm ? This is the breakthrough we 've been waiting for . There are cops outside of our house . Donnie , we have to get out of here . What is happening to me ? It isn 't a glitch . Someone 's trying to show me something , Ira . Do you actually think Neolution would let a clone take a position of real importance ? We have video of you admitting to euthanizing Brightborn babies . How do you respond ? - I saw her get shot . - Cosima , she saw someone else pick her up , and Delphine was alive when they took her away . What will happen to her ? Shit ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - Uh , I 'm going to call 9-1-1 , OK ? - No , no . Oh , my God ! Step away . Move away , please ! Why are you here , Krystal ? How did you know my name ? Oh , my God . Who the hell are you guys ? It 's through and through . Pulse is weakening . We stabilize and they 're away . The helicopter 's on standby . Inform the pilot ... And you double-checked everything , every chromosome ? Yeah , I even re-sequenced the genome with three of the new stem cell lines . - Well , my God . - See ? The vector was totally effective ! And the sequences remained stable in each lineage ? Yeah , yeah ! It worked . It really worked . Well done , Cosima . Why don 't you re-sequence the other subcultures ? I will be back . Wait , so what does that mean , then ? That we 've got a cure ? And ... and you 're gonna get well , Cosima ? Yeah . Yeah , fingers crossed . Oh , my God ... That is amazing news . Holy shit ! - I know . - Oh , my God . Oh , my God . We have , you know , a functioning therapy for all of us , for all the sestras . I 'm so relieved . I 'm so happy , Cosima ! I can 't wait to tell Alison and Helena . - Yeah ... - Hey . I miss you guys . Oh , God . We miss you too . - Oh , no . - What , love ? Ugh , nothing . I 'm just being denied access to the database . What 's up ... Hello ? Wait , what 's going on ? You 're offline . And she 's locked out of the data ? No , no , no , no . They can 't do this to us again . Euthanizing severely deformed newborns was ... That is the CEO of Brightborn . Serves her right for , like , running a stem cell baby factory . Wow . I mean , who would have thought the beauty industry was so corrupt ? I know , right ? - Oh , my God ! - What ? That 's him ! - Who ? - My name is Dr. Ian Van Lier . - That 's the guy ! - I 'm pleased to announce that I will be serving as interim CEO for Brightborn Technologies . Agh , come on . - Krystal ? - Yes . And I have intel - about that French doctor . - You mean Delphine ? Yeah , it 's about Brightborn and , like , a Dr. Van Lier ? OK ? But I am sick of being , like , yanked around by my brain at this point ... chain at this point , so I am not giving you anything unless you tell me what 's really going on . OK , OK . I know a place we can meet . That 's right , Jim , I 'm here outside the headquarters of Brightborn Technologies ... I can 't get in touch with Susan . I 'm going to arrange a helicopter to take us back - this afternoon . - Hello , Sarah . Rachel , what 's going on ? The second we hear about this cure , Cosima goes dark . Yes . Well , we 've been having the same problems . Communication is spotty on the island . No . She said she was kicked out of the database . And I 'm sure there 's a perfectly good explanation ... - Hey , hang up the phone . - How are we supposed - to trust that ? - We brought down Evie Cho with cooperation , did we not ? You don 't know the meaning of that word . Look ... who 's this Van Lier character who 's at Brightborn ? - Him . I have something . - Van Lier ... - is on damage control . - Brightborn 's genomic technologies are in no way tainted ... He 's Evie Cho 's personal physician . He 's been guiding her science for years . - So he 's another bloody Neo . - He will steward Evie 's side - during the transition . - Wait , what transition ? I thought we put Susan on top . I thought that was the bloody point . Well ... politics . Oh , God . Will someone listen to me ? Please ? - What ? - Felix ... It 's Krystal . She called me , right ? Now , she 's got dirt on Van Lier . Says that he 's connected to Delphine somehow . How does Krystal figure this shit out ? No idea . She 's doggedly wrong , but she gets results . - What do you think , S ? - I think we have two factions of Neos with competing technologies . Bots versus clones . And if we 're not careful , we are gonna get screwed again . We 're not gonna let that happen . We need to find out what Krystal knows about Van Lier . You 're with me , yeah ? Keep trying Cosima , S. Let 's get to the bottom of this . - Be careful . - We will ! Shit . - Swears . - Sorry . The Wi-Fi 's still down . And these cell replication rates are , like , off the charts . We 'll still get better , won 't we ? We are gonna get so much better . Cosima ... Are you OK ? Yeah , I just ... I just need a glass of water . Could you get me one ? Room service . Frittata ? I 've already eaten , Ferdinand . But have you been serviced ? Of course , my company will defend itself resolutely . Brightborn will recover . We were assured the euthanizations would minimize risk , not threaten us - with exposure . - You 've set the agenda back . - Years . - Well , hardly . - We can repackage the technology . - Yes , but ... we can 't repackage you , I 'm afraid . - What is this ? - I 'm sorry , Evie . It absolves the Brightborn entity of wrongdoing and protects the patents from further legal actions . No . I built this . It 's my technology . I 'm not about to sign it away . We just got started . Look at the big picture . We 're planning for the future here . - This is a minor setback . - We 've done great work , Evie . I promise it won 't be for nothing . No ! None of this is my fault ! It 's Susan Duncan and her clones ! Technology is subject to natural selection too , Evie . It changes and adapts . You 're an engineer ; you know that . Sh , sh . You built it . Let it take you . You want for me to kill this Evie Cho ? I don 't think she 's the problem anymore . You better just stay put for a while . Alison thinks we 've been hiding out long enough . I don 't think the frontier life agrees with her . - She has the shits . - Thank you . Uh , I think it 's Helena 's venison stew . I 'm loving it , though . It 's ... it 's great . - Yes , good . Intestines . - Mm ... I want to help my sestras . I know , Helena . Just , uh ... stand down for now . Sarah 's on it . We need to figure out who we 're really up against first . Something 's afoot . Susan 's gone dark . Her timing is suspicious . Come , now . Clone cures , implanted tech ... All that Neo intrigue can wait , - can it not ? - Don 't . Pleasure first , business second , remember ? I like the cane . Elegant . Multi-purpose . I 'm not the same . My ... infirmities . I don 't feel much of anything anymore . I spent a great deal of time and I lost a great deal of money searching for you . We had plans , you and I. Your eye is magnificent . But your self-pity is repugnant . Ah ! There she is . Get on your knees . God , I 've missed you . I 've missed you too , Ferdinand . - Hey . - Hi . Cosima 's cut off in a Neolution power vacuum , - and he calls in a beautician ? - Sweet move , right ? Hello , Krystal . Hello yourself . So what 's this intel you 've got on Delphine and Van Lier ? - It 's life or death . - Is it ? ' Cause I basically don 't believe anything you 're saying right now . Are you guys even for real ? Yeah ! If you have any questions we 're happy to help . Krystal , we talked about this and we told you that the less you know the better , remember ? Well , that 's not good enough for me anymore , OK ? If you want the scoop on Van Lier , you 're gonna have to - tell me everything . - Alright . Buzz us down . I warn you , Krystal , this is going to come as a bit of a shock . 'K , like , nothing shocks me nowadays , so ... Oh , this is way more realistic , yes . Hello , you . You look nice . - Well , thank you , Krystal . - You 're welcome . There 's someone we think you should meet . Oi , I 'm over here . I tried . I did . - Hi . Who are you ? - I 'm Sarah . I 'm , uh ... your clone . - OK , clones ? Like ... - Like genetic identicals . Made in the lab . Right . This is what you think I look like ? - Pretty much . - Yeah . 'K , are you , like , blind ? 'Cause this girl looks nothing like me . Like , first of all , my tits are way bigger . And secondly , even if you could drag a comb through that hair , she 's like , a 7 on a good day and I 've been told I 'm a 10 . 7 ? She has a point about your hair . OK , so you guys at this point have literally no idea what 's going on . It 's so cute . So let me lay it out for you straight , OK ? This is about human experiments and two factions fighting to control them . - Shit , that 's right . - Oh . Right ? So we have Est√©e Lauder , OK ? And then we have this Swedish company called Neolution . It 's crazy how right you are . - Thank you . - Krystal , could you elaborate just a little bit more ? Give us a few more details ? Absolutely . But like , hold on tight , 'cause this is very confusing . So Dr. Van Lier is absolutely Neolution , because he , like , showed up out of nowhere with all this medical gear , like , right after that French doctor was shot . OK ? And then they , like , took her off in a van . Wait , Van Lier is the one who saved Delphine ? I 'm sorry . Who are you again ? I 'm Sarah . I 'm your clone . Right , whatever . So Van Lier , like , knew my name , which is super freaky . And I will never forget his face , 'cause he was so pissed at me for being there . And ' cause he definitely had teenage acne . I could tell . No question . Thank you for that , Krystal . Um , you know , there 's actually something you could really help us with . OK ... Neolution 's wars of succession are fought over science . There 's an opportunity here . You haven 't gone all Neo on me , have you ? All that time with Susan Duncan . Ah ! Yes ... Neolution is a means to an end . Just don 't start spouting all that Leekie pop futurism , I beg you . Ow ! It goes deeper than that , believe me . You sound like a true believer . Controlling evolution ? It 's the ultimate power . Convert . Say it . Convert . Rachel ? I have news . Oh . Who is this ? - Hello . - He 's just a toy . - He has his socks on ... - What do you want , Ira ? Um ... Susan 's about to call . She 's excited . Something 's going on . Yes , we will trial the cure on them both . But it 's the cell generation rates ... they far surpassed expectations . I have only seen numbers like this once before . - In Kendall Malone . - Yes . All these years trying to replicate the original experiment . Finally , finally we can restart human cloning . Yes ! I can scarcely - believe it ! - Congratulations , Mother . - Neolution will back you . - The board has been convened and Evie has been firmly retired , I understand . I travel tomorrow . I want you both to be there . We 're back on top , Susan . We hope . The board will make its recommendations . Recommendations to whom ? I will see you in the morning . Took me a while to realize what the cell regeneration rates mean to you . You knew this was on the table , Cosima . It was there when you gave us Kendall 's cancer cells . You don 't even care about a cure , do you ? Of course I do ! We learn from our mistakes . You 're gonna keep making mistakes on people like me . That is the cost of what we do , for progress . You used me , Susan . Neolution 's founders understood the cost of progress . P.T. Westmorland wrote the doctrine right here in this room . OK ... That 's weird . I 'm sorry , Cosima . I can 't risk you interfering in the lab . Susan ? Susan . You 've got to be fricking kidding me . At last , we did it . Appearing before the board tomorrow . I 'll have to get my suit pressed . - No , you won 't . - What do you mean ? Step this way , little brother . Rachel ? Dr. Van Lier , please . Dr. Van Lier ! Comment on the rumours that there might be other complainants ? Thank you . Dr. Van Lier has a moment for a few questions . What other charges is Evie Cho facing besides the four counts on criminal negligence ? I can 't comment on any legal action against the former CEO . - Where is Evie Cho now ? - Disappeared behind her lawyers . We have no contact . Are you a Neolutionist ? What does Neolution have to say about deformed babies ? - Neolution ? - I 'm sorry , you are ... ? I 'm TMZ . I want to know if you have a comment on the attempted murder of Dr. Delphine Cormier ? - " Neolution " ? Can you clarify ? - Sir , who is Dr. Cormier ? I 'm sorry ; I don 't have time for this . That 's it for now , I 'm afraid . Sorry . Wait here . - Do you recognize me now ? - Of course , Krystal . There 's no need to make a scene . What do you want ? We 'll talk inside . Do I look stupid ? Meet me around the corner . No photos . Krystal ? Easy , doctor . We 're just gonna get in the truck over there . Miss Goderitch , whatever you think you 're doing , - this is a mistake . - Cut the shit , alright ? 'K , why am I giving away my gas cans and my food ? We 're cooperating to survive the zombie apocalypse . Ugh ! This is so boring . I don 't care about the zombie apocalypse . I 'm dressed like this to go on a real mission . - You 're Sarah Manning . - Yes , and we want to know what you 've done with Delphine Cormier . I passed her along to get the medical attention she needed . Why would you do that when your prot√©g√© , Evie , had her shot ? I did what I was told . My orders don 't come from Evie . Then who do you really work for ? Why don 't you put down the gun ? Your side has won . Susan finally has a cell line to restart human cloning . This was never about the cure . That 's why Cosima 's gone dark . Susan wants the science for herself . Susan 's next move . Tell me what it is . Susan is not your problem . Rachel has reconvened the board without her . - Rachel ? - Neolution has a board ? There 's always a bloody board . Gentlemen . Ladies . Thank you so much for moving this meeting up . There are moments which simply cannot wait . Congratulations . Human cloning is back on the table . Rachel ? Where the hell are you , you horrible bitch ? Damn . Wrong bitch . This isn 't what it looks like . Oh , Ira . Where 's Rachel ? We 're all familiar with Susan 's experiments . Her patient contribution to our understanding of epigenetics in human evolution . Well , I am not my mother . And if our goal is genetic change in the general population , I want to see it within my lifetime . This is exactly what Evie promised . Yes , but Evie had no baseline . And Susan has no balls . So let 's talk clones , shall we ? We have a saying : " Neolution follows the science . " But it doesn 't throw the deformed baby out with the bathwater , if you know what I mean . - We 're listening . - Clones are wholly patented , farmed and monitored lab animals . We can now produce them generation after generation . So I propose we marry the best of both worlds : Susan 's baseline with Evie Cho 's implanted tech . Rachel wants to put bots in clones ? - In multiple generations . - You clones are so much more than the sum of your parts . We operate in countries where human cloning is not illegal . Where our corporation supersedes their citizenship , their personhood . So why grant them this illusion of freedom ? If we want to know if our lab rats ' tails will grow back , we damn well will cut them off and see ! I have to say , this is some of your finest work , Felix . Thank you , Arthur . I do respect your opinion . Excuse me . What am I doing in this place ? Oh . I 've seen you before . Krystal ? Krystal would kick your balls into your throat . Oh , it 's you . I know where Rachel 's going . She 's gone back without you , Ira , because she wants to control the whole cell line . - She wants to cut Susan out . - No , Susan won 't allow it . Have you heard this ; " Neolution follows the science " ? Have you heard that ? - Answer her , Ira . - Come on ! - Yes . - Right ! Well , that 's what Rachel 's doing . She 's going to the island to follow it , OK ? And you know , you know what she 's capable of . Look , I know you care about Susan . Oh , yeah . They 're shagging . She 's all alone out there . Which is why you and I have to get on that helicopter . You can make the call . Hello ? - I can still go with you . - No , this is my thing . - I 'm doing this alone . - It 's because it 's bloody - Rachel , isn 't it ? - No , no . It 's because it 's Cosima , and it 's the cure . S , I 'm immune . If I don 't fix this , it 's my curse to watch my sisters die . And you have to take care of Kira . You had a brother with a scar . I 'm nothing like my brothers . Stay seated . She 's going alone , Ira . - Sorry . You 'll be collateral . - What ? You can 't ... Hey . I 'm going to be back soon , OK ? I know . I worry about all the sisters . There 's so many we don 't even know . We 're doing this for all of them , too . I want us all to be free . OK . Mother ! Why didn 't anyone fetch me ? Rachel . Who are you ? I 've seen you before . Susan is in the kitchen . Do not waver . Who was that man ? A messenger . Where did he come from ? From the board ? You have no idea what you 've done . I know exactly what I 've done . I grew up in boardrooms like that . No . No , not like that one . Power does not equal free will , Rachel . You are owned . A legal description which I can rewrite . They 'll never accept you . And when the lobbying has ended and the laws have passed , who would you choose as the first face of human cloning ? You are betraying me . You are betraying your sisters and you are betraying yourself . Cosima . Hey . What 's going on ? Rachel 's back and she 's very angry . Susan says that we have to get to the boat . Is that the boat that 's in your painting ? Yes . Come on . Wait . Charlotte . Are there other people on this island ? Sometimes , but we mustn 't go there . Why ? Why ? Who 's there ? Susan says that we have to get to the boat . Now come on , before Rachel comes down . Uh ... wait ! Wait . You wait here , OK ? - OK . - Just ... I 'll be right back . You should be thanking me . You created me to be your heir , didn 't you ? A child raised by Neolution . Seemed like a good idea at the time , but it wasn 't mine . Whose was it , then ? You gave me to this . I should never have left you . Is that what you want to hear ? You made me think you were dead . So now I must do what Neolution raised me to do , - make the hard choices . - The hard choice is restraint . You 're fading , Mother . The future is bolder than you . Where 's the cell line ? I want the cure . Oh , Rachel . All the joy and insight your sisters have given me . - We should go . - For every Sarah , every Cosima , I regret making you . Sorry , Rachel . The board does not have the final say . And I will not allow you to move forward with any of this . Go . Run . It 's not up to you anymore , mother . I think it 's just a little further . It 's getting dark . Are you sure this is the right way ? Cosima ? Get up . We have to get to the boat . OK . I 'm OK . I 'm OK . I 'm OK . - I think we 're lost . - It 's too cold . There . Let 's stop for a second . Don 't fall asleep , OK ? Susan . Hey . - Sarah . - What happened ? OK , OK , OK . Oh , Rachel 's gone mad . - Where 's Cosima ? - I sent her up-island with Charlotte , to a boat . Where ? How do I get to them ? Sarah , Rachel 's taken the cure . The whole cell line . Did you treat Cosima ? No ! No , Rachel ! Rachel , stop ! Control yourself ! You have what you want ! I want you , Sarah . - You crazy bitch ! - You 're not immune to me , you cockroach . Rachel ! You 're one of us . One of you ? You didn 't even know what you were until Beth Childs walked off that train platform . I was raised for this . This is mine . My time . Rachel Duncan , stop . Rachel , desist , or I will shoot you down myself . You won 't shoot me , mother . Go on , then . Pull the trigger . You can 't , can you ? I 'm the chosen daughter , whether you like it or not . I 'm going to need blood pressure and core temperature , please . She 's hypothermic . Look at me ? OK . Please leave us . Thank you . Keep breathing . Keep breathing . I 'm right here . I 'm going to keep you warm . I think I 'm dying . No . No , you 're not . I won 't let you . I finished our homework . What ? I 've made my own decisions . But I was led here . I 've seen things in my eye . I 've seen the messenger . I 've seen the swan . Your eye ... He 's getting capricious in his old age . Losing his patience for natural selection . Who is ? Who built my eye ? You know . It 's the man behind the curtain . The man who wrote the book over a century ago . That 's impossible . Not for him . Altruism poses a distinct challenge to the evolutionist . Has altruism saved you ? That wasn 't what it was . You won 't be allowed to stay with her . I know , but she 's my patient , so if you 'll please excuse us . Cosima . Hey . We have to be ... very careful here . It 's not safe . Is our homework what I think it is ? You found your cure ! You can shoot me up , like old times . I will . But you must not tell anyone . - OK ? - OK . - Sarah . - Mum , I need help . - I ... - Hello , Sarah . It 's been eons . Now , don 't worry . The whole family 's just fine . - Hello Rachel . - Ian . - How was your fare ? - It 's done . The signs are secure . Congratulations . Mr. Westmorland will see you now .

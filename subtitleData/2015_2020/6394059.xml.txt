 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... Baron Von Strucker thought that Sunil Bakshi was well-groomed to serve . So why is he not present ? Compliance will be rewarded . - Your father was good once . - He 's a monster . Just one dinner . Ethan , I hear you 're headed away . Taking some time to backpack . I need you to get me into Fury 's Toolbox . It 's way beyond anything I 've ever encountered . Without Coulson , I 'm afraid it 's just a piece ofjunk . Are we having any issues following Agent Fitz ? You tailed him ? - Hunter ? - Fitz ? Maybe you could show me how to shake a tail , like , now ? That won 't end well . Ooh . - Get us in the air . - Will do . Mike ? Hey , Fitz . Good to see you again . New hardware . Hey , how did you upgrade ? Not now , Fitz . Strap in . Hey , those tips for evading the tail were very useful . Thanks . The Toolbox ? Yeah , it 's been a while since I 've been in the field solo . Not since , um ... Um ... It looks like you held up all right . Yeah , held up quite well , actually . And you ? Fitz , we need to find Skye . Problem is , all we know is that she was taken by the same powered man who took Raina and Cal . - Do we have any leads ? - No , but HYDRA might . HYDRA 's new heads , Strucker and List . My sources say they 're researching powered people . Apparently they 're even more obsessed than Whitehall . We need to know what they know . Get into HYDRA . Desperate times , desperate measures . Count me in . I 'm relieved to hear you say that . We 're making a deal . With Ward . Ethan Johnston , 26 , potential Enhanced . Died of cardiogenic shock in the 37th hour of experimentation . Still no quantum signature ? No , Dr. List . That 's a waste . Take the cadaver to the lab . Compare him to the other samples . Hail HYDRA . I told you I 'd put our family back together . Yes , you did . Last night was something . Almost exactly as I imagined it . Some things were different . She 's still afraid of me . Whose fault is that , Cal ? No , I know . I know . You 're right . I just ... I wish she could 've known me back when we were first married . When I was calm , and my mind wasn 't so jumbled . We 've both changed . We 're not the people we used to be . To lament that is a waste of time . You 're right . She 's here now . With us . And that 's pretty cool , right ? Me being here puts you in a tough spot . I know . I know . I see the stink eye from everyone . They know you 're not like us . They 're wondering why you 're here . I don 't wanna make things harder for you . I 'll stay here , be quiet . I 'll wait for our next family dinner . Hey , how about next time , we grill , huh ? Whatever you like . - Yeah . - In the meantime , why don 't I have Gordon take you to pick up some of your belongings , so that your time here is less ... Prison-like ? That would be fan-friggin-tastic ! I miss my tunes . Sorry , I wish I didn 't have to , but ... Is it my go ? You 're about a million miles away . Sorry . I 'm back at dinner . Dinner with my parents can stress me out , too . It wasn 't stressful exactly . I mean , I didn 't wanna see Cal , let alone be in the same room as him . I was sure he was gonna have some twisted surprise . But he didn 't . It was nice . That 's good . Isn 't it ? Did Jiaying tell you that she 's sending Cal away ? He 's not coming back . He doesn 't exactly belong here . You think it 's a bad idea . It 's not a good one . He 'll get upset and someone will get hurt . Talk to her . She 's your mom . Yeah . It 's nice having someone normal to talk to . You hit me . Finally , an actual partner . A little tip , you could 've avoided losing your footing if you would 've flipped into it . Flip ? Now you 're just making fun of me . Maybe a little . But it 's not like I can bench press a small hatchback . Yeah , we all have our talents . How 's Simmons doing with Fury 's Toolbox ? You ask me , she 's stalling . Maybe . It doesn 't bother you ? I 'm out . Yeah , a lot bothers me . It bothers me that we 've been so focused on Coulson and Fury 's Toolbox . We have a tail on Fitz , for God 's sakes . It 's not like HYDRA 's gone . Coulson may be a lot of things , but he 's not the enemy . You sound like Hunter . Well , he might 've been right on this one . Yeah , I 've been wondering that myself . The only way to move forward right now is to get the truth out . Any idea how to get the truth out of Fury 's Toolbox ? Uh-huh . And it 's flying in from the aircraft carrier as we speak . They 're bringing in some state-of-the-art , next-gen fiber laser . That can cut through Vibranium ? If anything can . Good . It 's time we have it all out in the open . It 's not exactly quite so simple . Simmons , what did you do ? I duplicated the Box . Switched out Fury 's real Box for a fake , and all this time I 've been pretending to be working on it , when ... Where is the real Box now ? Fitz has it . I didn 't know who else to turn to . You 're the only one I can trust here anymore . I 'll handle it . Thanks for the picture . It really helped clear things up . Wait , Mom , what men ? When exactly did they call ? Okay , if they call again , don 't say a word . I 've gotta go . Call when I can . Agent 33 , you 're looking well . - Hey , baby . - Hey , sweetie . Why don 't you drop by ? Love to catch up . That mask on your face , got any more of those lying around ? Afraid not . At least I have my winning personality . They didn 't hurt you , did they ? No , I 'm okay . You shouldn 't have come . Fact that this guy hasn 't killed me yet means they need me . Mike . Ward . Turn around . You know what needs to happen . All of it . Ward . I 'm flattered . Bringing the robot along just for a sit-down with me . There 's no need for false modesty . We both know you 're that good . But frankly , this isn 't about you . I 'm after bigger fish . Strucker , List . Can 't help you . Not in HYDRA anymore . But you were . Even then , I only knew them by reputation . Never met either . Again with the false modesty . You 're resourceful . Bet you know a guy who knows a guy . You know , last time I suggested we work together , you called me a deluded son of a bitch . Things change . I 'm offering you a deal . Help me and I 'll let you walk away . Free and clear . No more looking over your shoulder . When something 's too good to be true , it 's a lie . Not lying . I tried the stick with you before , didn 't work so well . So I 'm offering a carrot . I 'm listening . Get me inside . After that , I put you through the T.A.H.I.T.I. Protocol , and then you 're free to go . Wipe my memories . Wow , that sounds like a threat , not a carrot . I like who I am . A murderer and a traitor ? Sorry , my offer 's the only way you leave here . I 'm taking a huge chance . You could 've run . You didn 't . You risked your freedom for her . That says something . Says that maybe there 's still good left in you . Maybe Garrett , your family , didn 't destroy all that . T.A.H.I.T.I. will erase all the bad . Let you be the man you wanna be . Start over . Free and clear ? I give you my word as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. I might know a guy . No , no , no , no ! No ! I 'd just hoped the highly modified hydrofluoric acid might ... Stop . I told her the truth . Truth about what exactly ? Fitz replaced Fury 's Toolbox with a fake , ran off with the real one , and you 've been covering for him since . Nobody 's happy about it . I understand you 're confused who to trust , where to put your loyalties . Yes , I am . But we 've lost Coulson , the Box and Fitz . Eventually , I 'm gonna have to tell Gonzales and the rest of the board what happened . Unless we can find Coulson another way . You know Mike Peterson 's hardware . You want me to try to tap into his feed ? Will that be a problem ? An opportunity to exonerate Coulson and Fitz ? No , it 's not a problem . I 'll keep you updated . This is crazy . We wanna find Skye , yes , okay ? But if we are making a deal with ... The devil . I 'm afraid it 's in the job description , mate . Expedient alliances with despicable characters . So you 'd work with Bobbi ? No , not a chance , and point made . Look , mate , we 're infiltrating HYDRA . Our options are limited . Ward is a psychopath . But for now , he 's our psychopath . So , we use him to stay one step ahead . I 've searched the records . No mention of precognition . Raina could be the first of her kind . I was . A gift like hers could change everything . Imagine , she could warn us of threats before they happen . If that is her gift . Uh , sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt . No , we 're finished here . I 'll let you know how it goes . Was that about Cal ? I wanna talk to you about that . Cal 's dangerous , I know . But he 's better when he 's with us . That may be true , but he can 't stay here . Well , could we give him a heads up or ... And risk how he gets ? You think you 've seen him at his worst ? You haven 't . Well , that 's my point . You know how he 'll get when Gordon just abandons him in the middle of nowhere . Not nowhere . We 're taking him home . It doesn 't matter . He will feel abandoned and people will get hurt . Those people aren 't my concern . Well , they 're mine . I 'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . The longer he stays , the more attention he draws , the more attention he demands . I can 't make exceptions . He 's not one of us . Sometimes , as a leader , I have to do things I 'd rather not do . Did you get the package ? Just like they said . I still don 't trust them . Hell , no . But we need them to trust us . Something 's not right . Why isn 't May here ? There 's something Coulson 's not saying . Which is why we should make a run for it . The idea of them wiping away who you are ... Hey , no one 's gonna wipe anything . We have the upper hand . Whatever Coulson 's endgame is doesn 't matter , because he is gonna help us get to ours . What 's this ? Thought we could put that on the windowsill . It 's beautiful . It 's too bad . I liked our house . It won 't be our last . Promise . At the end of this , you 'll be whole , and we 'll be together . Break it up . Let 's go . This just gets better and better . Not to worry . We are working with Director Coulson . You 're gonna do whatever he says . Understand ? Of course . I 'm more than happy to comply . Get him out of there . Hey . Um ... Sorry , uh , I was expecting Gordo . He can 't like you calling him that . Oh , he loves it . Um , come in . Uh , so , I was , um , gonna find you today , but I didn 't wanna overdo it after last night . I tend to overdo . Big overdoer . Yeah , I noticed . Um , so , I guess you heard , I 'm gonna be out of here for a little bit . Yeah , I heard . Hey , you wanna put in an order ? I 'll bring you back something from the mainland . Gossip mags , soda pop . Do you like Funyuns ? I 'm okay . Thank you . So , where are you going ? China ? What makes you think I 'd go there ? No . God , no . Oh , I 'm sorry . Jiaying said that you were going home . So , I just assumed that ... Oh , oh , of course . No , that makes sense . No , I was in China volunteering for Doctors Without Borders . Wow . Hard to picture that , right ? I was supposed to be there two weeks . But I met your mother and I couldn 't leave . She stole my heart . Uh , no . Home is , um , Milwaukee . That 's where we were gonna bring you up . I should take you there sometime . I don 't know , maybe show you around the old haunts . Why not tomorrow ? I wanna go with you . Okay . Best day ever ! Yeah . You can 't just leave him on the side of the road like an unwanted puppy . It 's irresponsible and cruel for both a puppy or Cal . And Cal 's not a puppy . He 's a pit bull . A raging pit bull who will attack if he ... I don 't wanna hear about the people you think you 're responsible for . This isn 't about them . This is about me . You asked me to be decent , give Cal one dinner . I did that . And I empathize . After one night , you understand him ? Yes . Because I spent my entire life searching for you . I lied and I broke laws just to get the tiniest sliver of information . And I had no memories of my family . Cal had memories , he knows what he lost . Listen , I 'm ... I 'm not asking you to let him stay . Just let me go with him . I 'll talk to him . I 'll soften the blow . Let him know I 'll visit , and that he hasn 't lost us forever . Bakshi reached out . Arranged a meeting with Dr. List . And are we sure we trust Stepford Bakshi ? " Trust " might be a little strong . Bakshi 's been instructed to act exactly as he would have before . Before the brainwashing ? Oh , well , in that case , I feel comforted . Any questions ? How much longer ? Couple hours . So , Fitz , how 've you been ? Hey ! Hey , hey ! Hey , hey ! Sit down , Agent Fitz . Bakshi , sir ... Bakshi , no , he is ... He 's the exact same as Ward . So he will double-cross us the second that he 's with HYDRA . Yes , he would , if he was going in alone . He 's not ? He 'll have his bodyguard with him . That 'd be me . We 'll monitor the entire meet though Mike 's eye . Dr. List 's instructions were explicit . Bakshi was to come alone . Luckily , Bakshi 's good at talking his way out of things . Aren 't you ? I 've been told it 's one of my more useful skill sets , yes . See ? No problem . - Any luck ? - No . They were going to find out . You know that . You do realize that it was my plan to switch the Box , not Fitz 's ? We had to get out in front of it . I mean , he carried the plan out to perfection , but I handed him the schematics . I don 't care whose plan it was . You threw Fitz to the wolves ! To protect you . They raided the base for that Box . You 're lucky you 're not in a cell right now . I can 't believe what I 'm hearing . You 're on their side ? It 's not about sides . It 's about the truth . Coulson left us with a mountain of lies . And the only way to understand his reasoning was inside that Box . Honestly , I don 't care what 's in it . The only thing I know is that Coulson was just trying to protect Skye . Thanks , Gordo . Now beat it . Cal . I 'll be back when you 're ready . We 'll let you know . Our first father-daughter date ! Though " date " might be the wrong word . Is that weird ? Is this weird ? Yeah , it 's weird . It 's a little weird . So , did you have an apartment around here , or ... Oh , I didn 't live here . Worked here . My office is , uh , over there . Oh . Uh ... Then , where are we going ? I thought you said you had to grab some of your things ? No , I told you I wanted to show you around . Thought we 'd get a pastry , get to know each other a little ? Sure . Who doesn 't love pastry ? Right ? Oh , there 's this great little mom-and-pop bakery just around the corner . Swedish place . Swiss . I don 't know . I mix ' em up . What 's wrong ? You know what doesn 't have the smell of buttery goodness wafting out of it on your way to work ? A currency exchange ? Gotta be someplace to eat around here . So did you have ... You had a practice here ? Yeah . Before I met your mother . She was a doctor , too ? Studying to be one . She had a natural gift for it . Compassionate . Beyond intelligent . Wise . Always five steps ahead of me . She wanted to finish med school here . Oh , and there was this great little charter school just around the corner . A charter school for medicine ? What ? Oh , no , not for her , for you . Oh , it was gonna be perfect ! I was gonna drop you off every morning and pick you up . Help you with your science fair project , the volcano , because who doesn 't love a volcano , right ? We 'd go to the father-daughter dances together , get ice cream . Ah . The life we could 've had . Should 've had . I 'm sorry . Memory lane isn 't always that fun to visit . It 's okay . Come on , I 've got ice cream on the brain . We are online . It 's good to see you alive and well , Mr. Bakshi . Dr. List , a pleasure . You 're a difficult man to find these days . Please . Three men , heavily armed . Bet there 's more where they came from . Does it matter ? You 've got a cyborg on board with rockets in his arm . He 's not a cyborg , he 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent with rockets in his arm . Our world is much more complicated now , after the tragic death of Dr. Whitehall and the ensuing bloodbath that it caused . Thank you . Tell me , Mr. Bakshi , exactly how did you manage to escape unscathed ? What are you implying , Doctor ? Well , most of HYDRA 's leaders were wiped out in one fell swoop , but not you . I was just curious if you might know anyone involved ? Let 's see how Bakshi holds up under questioning . He 's held up to worse than this . You think I poisoned The Baroness ? Killed Bloom ? Someone put a bullet in his head . I assumed it was you . Or Strucker . You had the most to gain , and look , here you sit . Alive and well . With more money and manpower than ever . See ? Told you he was good . The truth is , I didn 't escape unscathed . I was captured by the U.S. government . Mr. Peterson helped me escape . You do recognize him , don 't you ? Oh , you should . HYDRA invested quite a bit of funds turning Mr. Peterson into the perfect killing machine . Money well spent , I might add . - What 's he doing ? - He 's gaining List 's trust . I know Strucker has been experimenting on powered individuals . I believe that with a compliance upgrade , Mr. Peterson would prove quite useful to him . You 're offering him to me ? Consider it a sign of good faith . This wasn 't the plan . What 're you doing ? Getting us to Strucker . Bastard sold us out ! Put the gun down , now . It was the only way . - I won 't warn you again . - Will you just listen to me ? Do you want to get to Strucker or not ? - Fitz ? Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm delightful . Strucker wants powered people . Bakshi alone doesn 't get you to him . Deathlok does . And he can take care of himself , trust me . " Trust me " ? I ought to shoot you just for saying that . Um , sir ? What if this goes south ? Would you have been willing to sacrifice Mike ? That wasn 't your call to make . Sir , Deathlok is , um ... Is that Deathlok 's targeting system ? Yes . He 's gonna ... He 's about to kill everyone . Not a bad idea , actually . No ! We need them alive ! Fitz , tell Mike to stand down . - Yeah , no , that 's not gonna happen . - Let him go , 33 . My name is Kara , and I don 't work for you anymore . Weapons systems are hot . On the count of three , we all put our weapons down . Three ! You pull anything like that again , I 'll throw your ass off this Quinjet at 20,000 feet . Doctor , there 's been another incident . Excuse me . We 're close . Put us in the air . And then we 'll see quite how loyal you and your Enhanced friend really are . They 're taking off . If Strucker 's overseas , I 'd say that 's probably where they 're going . Then we tail them . Bookstores , dead . Video stores , dead . Old-fashioned ice cream shops , dead ! The Internet killed everything . I 'm not sure the Internet killed ice cream . But how about we get a 40-ounce of malt liquor instead ? I 'm kidding . Sort of . A-ha . I learned something about you . You 're funny . That 's good . Hey . Hey , where are your manners ? Apologize to my daughter ! Hey ! Hey , calm down , okay ? I bumped him . Sorry , that was ... That was my bad . Yeah , it 's all cool here . You know , I bet they have ice cream . I 'll go see . - Hello ? - May , it 's Skye . I need to talk to Coulson . Skye ? Where are you ? Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay , but I don 't have much time . Where 's Coulson ? He 's out looking for you . Where have you been ? I 'm with Cal , but I won 't be for long . And when I leave him , he 's gonna be pissed , okay ? Dangerous . S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to come get him and make sure he doesn 't hurt anyone . Skye , slow down . Okay , there 's no time to explain . Please , it 's just too complicated . Just don 't hurt him . Skye , where are you ? Skye ? I got Neapolitan and vanilla . Uh , you pick . She left the line open for us . We 'll have the location in a minute . She doesn 't sound like a hostage . More like she 's playing along . Mack and I can take a team , go get them . Do it . You 're bored . Am I boring you ? No . You are a lot of things , but boring is not one of them . Oh . Tell you what . Let 's head over to my old office , okay ? There 's something there I wanna show you . Something really special . Any word from Lincoln ? Nothing yet . They 've been gone a while . I regret letting her go , but at least Lincoln 's there to protect her . Actually , there is something that needs your attention right now . It 's Ethan . Ethan ? I thought you dropped him off on a camping trip . I did . But when I went to bring him back , he was gone . I can 't find him anywhere . Are you saying he 's missing , or worse ? I 'm not sure . But even if they knew who he was , that he was one of us , how can they get hold of him ? Right now , I 'm not concerned with how as much as who . We 're landing ? Already ? I thought Strucker was in Eastern Europe ? He is . But first , we 're making a stop . Have you heard of quantum entanglement , Mr. Bakshi ? No , I 'm afraid not . Well , we at HYDRA , for the last several months , actually ... Quantum entanglement ? Sounds like a method of torture . We have found incidents of photon intensity so great that particles can exist simultaneously in two spaces over great distances . Never liked science . Or big words . But for something to be in two places concurrently ... No , no , no . This is a quantum entanglement bridge . We think it was created by a powered person . One we intend to capture . The teleporter . They 're tracking the teleporter . The one that , um , took Cal in Wisconsin , and Raina . - And Skye . - This is about Skye ? Why would HYDRA want her ? Don 't know . Please , uh , excuse the mess and the , uh , roaches . Johnson ? Is that your last name ? Was . Pretty ordinary , huh ? I changed it to something more sinister when I went on the run . Daisy Johnson . Huh . I , um ... I had one of these . Coincidence ? I think not . Genetics . Keep it , if you like . How is all this stuff still here ? I own the building . You own the building ? Mmm . Every wall , every bulb , every cockroach . I wasn 't rich , but you would 've grown up quite comfortable . Had to shutter everything down after , uh , well , you know . Only been back a few times over the years . So this is like your stash pad ? Where you keep all of your old stuff ? Oh , I like that . Stash pad . Makes it sound better than " crappy office . " Okay . My grandfather 's field kit . WW II . I used this to put your mother back together again . The truth is , her gift was the real healer . She 's a walking miracle , your mother . The way she suffered , and endured , and fought through it . You still love her . How could I not ? I mean , I know she resented me for a time , after we lost you . But I think now that we 're back together , that we could ... Please , stop . What ? What ? What 'd I say ? We 're not all back together . You can 't hang onto the past like this , you need to move on . We all do . Jiaying , she 's responsible for all those people , and I ... I ... I 'm an adult now . And as much as you wanna turn back the clock to the time of science fairs and father-daughter dances ... They 're gone . Yeah . I know . I know . Look , it doesn 't mean that we can 't see each other . I could visit . Visit ? Where are you going ? Who 's there ? Come out where I can see you . Relax . It 's just me . Lincoln ? What are you doing here ? Jiaying sent me to make sure everything was cool . Why wouldn 't everything be cool ? What 's going on here ? Wait a minute , you think Daisy isn 't safe with me ? I didn 't say that , just calm down . Don 't patronize me . Who the hell do you think you are ? I 'm her father ! Fan out . If the teleporter is here , we want him alive . Cal , let me explain ... - No . - I ... What an idiot I 've been , huh ? I see what 's happening . You were gonna dump me here like yesterday 's trash . You don 't wanna spend time with me . This isn 't Daddy 's day out . This is goodbye . - It 's not forever , okay , it ... - Skye , don 't . Her name is Daisy ! Cal ! Well , what are you waiting for ? After everything I did for Jiaying ... Lincoln . For our family . The years of searching , the pain and the rejection ! Cal , I 'm warning you . Oh , you 're warning me ? Watch out ! What 's S.H.I.E.L.D. doing here ? It 's not S.H.I.E.L.D. , it 's HYDRA . Get her out of here . I 'll take care of this . Hey , hey , fellas ! I can handle myself . No . Don 't use your powers , you could bring the whole building down . I 'll help hold ' em off . Let 's not lose our heads , okay ? Just go . Please . Sir , it 's Skye ! Skye 's here ! - Where ? - Tenth floor . The Skye who shot you three times ? Four . Don 't even think about it . You keep HYDRA off us , I 'll find Skye . Hey ! What are you made of ? Whoever you are , you don 't wanna do this . I 'm a friend of Skye 's . Sure . And I 'm the Hulk . Sir , Deathlok 's down . I 've lost his feed . Oh . Uh ... Sir , I think somebody 's trying to hack into it . We need to split up ! We 'll cover you ! Go find Skye ! Where the hell is your boyfriend going ? Look out ! Ahhh ! Skye ? Who the hell 's that guy ? Don 't know . Packs a mean spark . I think he 's protecting Skye . Where 's she now ? Can you scan the floor ? Got him ! Signal 's coming in . Optics are down . I think she went around that corner . Bloody hell . Stay down , kid . I got this . Where the hell you been ? You missed all the fun . Not quite . Take them both . Skye ? Coulson ! I need to get you out of here . No , no ! Not yet , not yet ! No ! Don 't go ! I had her . Damn it , I had her ! Deathlok 's down , we 've got powered people on site , HYDRA 's storming the building . - What happened to you ? - Ah , it 's merely a flesh wound . A bad one . We 're outmanned , outgunned , and our only backup is Fitz . Your call , boss . Standard HYDRA issue . I 'd say we missed them by less than an hour . Hell of a fight , though . Looks like everyone cleared out . Not everyone . I doubled back after HYDRA took off . Their clean-up crew really sucks , doesn 't it ? What the hell happened here , Coulson ? Tell you all about it back at the base . Take me to your leader .

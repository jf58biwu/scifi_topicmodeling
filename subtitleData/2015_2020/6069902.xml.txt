 Has there been any contact with Count Mazuurek since then ? his Landing Castle is still functional . that means that Count Mazuurek is alive . Perhaps he is lying low and waiting for an opening . Or perhaps ... Or perhaps he has been taken prisoner by the Terrans . it would be prudent to assume that Count Mazuurek will not return . there is but one course of action . What are you ... ? I cannot allow that Earthborn stray to run loose any longer . Resupplying and inspection operations are on schedule . No delays reported . we are working in concert with the base 's repair depot to get back on schedule . Very good . Carry on . ma 'am . And our Mars Knight guest ? Not a word . He appears to be the silent type . do you know why men who are the silent type are so attractive ? Is it because they always seem calm and collected ? It 's because they sit quietly and listen to what you have to say . And our replacement crew ? and station shifts have been revised . A few of them were members of our previous crew . Warrant Officer Kaizuka and Lt. Marito . who is now serving as an official medical officer with the rank of ensign . there has been a request from Ensign Kaizuka to interrogate the Mars Knight . From Kaizuka Junior ? He says he wants to use his analytical engine . Inaho ? All I did was customize the firmware that it was already running . too . How 's it feel ? Not all that different . okay ? it 'll already be too late . I won 't . I 'm aware of the risks . this is where you are . Yuki . Got a minute ? why did you decide to serve aboard this ship ? why ? right ? You should have packed up and left once your injuries were healed . Yuki . it 's not . I 'm a soldier . so it is the same . It is not ! I regret it every day ... That I made you into a soldier . " Why didn 't I stop you ? I became a soldier because I wanted to protect you and the world you live in . But you still ... I 'm sorry . But I can 't stand around doing nothing . then ? That girl 's not the Princess Asseylum you used to know . She 's now an enemy who 's trying to conquer the Earth . That person is a fake . The real one is still alive somewhere . How could you possibly know that ? That 's what my left eye determined . I think she 's being held against her will . So I want to rescue Seylum . That 's impossible ! she was shot right in front of me . and she was shot as she was trying to help me . That 's why I have to save her . Nao ... It 's been a long time . What is the Kataphrakt 's status ? they found even the sub-frame had been warped by the gravity waves . Looks like it basically needs an overhaul . I hear you quit drinking . My primary physician is a real nag . then . There 's always room for toasts . You 're unbelievable . It was doctor 's orders . Medicinal . How are you feeling ? looks like . I heard you were subjected to a full body search . I never imagined I would be subjected to such primitive questioning . We can 't have you using a poison tooth . What an outdated notion ... That does seem to be your national character . I suppose Vers ' feudal system would seem just as anachronistic . change it yourselves . Spoken like someone born into a land of plenty . You 're like pigs who are about to die . it is too late . You know quite a bit . You admit I 'm right ? about pigs . Even though Princess Asseylum had never seen birds before . You have spoken to Princess Asseylum ? She spent time aboard this ship . then . It wasn 't exploitation . It was cooperation . you say ? Can you tell me one thing ? Do I look like a man who would sell out his country lightly ? You don 't look that way . Or sound that way . Which makes you the perfect man to ask . Have you sworn loyalty to Princess Asseylum ? Rayet ? you won 't have any energy when we go into battle . I 'm not hungry . the weight starts coming off at your boobs . I 've never gone on a diet before . Rayet ? That 's amazing ! How do you keep that figure ? too ? Commander . ma 'am ? I thought it would be nice to eat somewhere besides the ship while we 're in port . do we ? has anyone seen Inaho ? but I haven 't seen him . Ensign Kaizuka is interrogating the Mars Knight at the moment . Inaho 's interrogating him ? I 'm heading back . wait ... Rayet ? She didn 't tell us the secret to her figure . you are saying that the Princess Asseylum currently at our moon base is an impostor ? Yes . where is the real one ? Is she being held prisoner somewhere ? Or is there a reason she cannot show herself ? Possibly both . as well ? It 's an analytical engine . Impossible ! I am not so foolish that I would believe such a preposterous tale ! We 've retrieved your Kataphrakt . Its Aldnoah Drive was knocked offline by the force of the explosion . It will never work again . didn 't you ? Out of fear that Terrans would steal it . Weren 't you listening ? It stopped working after the explosion . you shut it down intentionally . I will say it again . Princess Asseylum is an impostor . as well . Large birds . Small birds . And brilliantly-colored birds . They 're beautiful ... This is how birds fly through Earth 's skies . but there are some species of flightless birds . Flightless birds ? I suspect that Princess Asseylum might say that she finds it sad that they cannot fly even though they have wings . She is a kindhearted person . But their inability to fly does not trouble them in the least . perhaps the ones to be pitied are the birds but are kept in a cage . Why would someone lock them in a cage ? Because they are so very beautiful . Princess Asseylum was shot right in front of me . Shot by Count Saazbaum . Preposterous ! Who then left with Slaine Troyard . with them . Count Saazbaum was celebrated as the hero who rescued Princess Asseylum ! He 's no hero . He 's the mastermind behind the plot to assassinate her . Count Saazbaum is ? Those bastards tricked my father and used him as much as they could and then they killed him like some lowly insect . You are Vers-born ? I see ... your father would have died sooner or later . Consider it a blessing that he wasn 't branded a traitor and lynched . What 's that supposed to mean ? Are you saying my father deserved to be killed ? Let 's go . I 'm not done with him ! Come on . Let go ! You must think I 'm an idiot . That I 'll always be bound by the past . Always be a prisoner to it . You 're right . I 'm just like them . and fight them . A stupid Martian ! You 're different . - I am not . - You are . - I am not ! - You are . I 'm no different ! I hate Martians ! And I hate myself most of all ! you say ? insisting that he be put through to Princess Asseylum . What does Milord Slaine say ? sir . What is all this commotion ? sir . dear . You can 't have your discussion with me in the room ? Highness . even here at the moon base . I must ask that you avoid public areas . Shall I speak to him ? isn 't it ? Highness ... Is there a problem ? Patch him through to the throne room . Her Highness Asseylum is most gracious . Please forgive this sudden disturbance . Count Marylcian . what did you wish to discuss with me ? It must be urgent indeed for you to contact me without first obtaining Count Troyard 's permission . Ah . One cannot speak to you in private ? Count Troyard is being rather overprotective to keep you under guard thus . Perhaps " under guard " was a poor choice of words . He is more a knight who seeks to protect his princess imprisoned in her ivory tower . my apologies if I have given offense . I compared Your Highness to a bird in a cage . A bird in a cage ? that is the expression used on Earth to describe one who has been deprived of her freedom . Message from base command ! They report that the prisoner has escaped ! Put the ship on alert ! Inform all duty stations ! ma 'am ! These late-night alarms are killing me ... we have to get out there ! Rayet ? it 's you . Come with me . Hurry . Why are you doing this ? I want you to go back to your Landing Castle and find out where the real Princess Asseylum is . Why me ? Because you want the same thing as Princess Asseylum . I don 't think that you ever had any desire to attack Earth . Your left eye also told you that ? I can tell that much even without using my left eye . You were very familiar with Earth . Your interest in Earth goes beyond its value as an invasion target . So you do see everything . There 's one other thing that I want you to find out for me . What Slaine Troyard 's objective is . Keep going north and you 'll reach the Martian Landing Castle . You 'll need to walk from here . Here . Food and water . We can 't have you dying of thirst before you get away . though . I need you to keep Princess Asseylum safe . may I ask you one thing ? What is your name ? member of the Vers Empire Orbital Knights ' 37 Clans . Mazuurek ... There 's a type of folk music on Earth with a similar name . I became fascinated with Earth . And your name ? Inaho . Inaho Kaizuka . Mr. Mazuurek . Take good care of Princess Asseylum . Inaho Kaizuka . why did you ask me to help with this ? What do you mean ? Didn 't you think that I would kill that Martian ? Just like that time with Princess Asseylum ? you didn 't actually kill her back then . - I failed to kill her . - You 're different . - I am not . - You are . I am not – . You are . You 're not the same person you were then . Mustang Leader to Mustang 11 . What 's your status ? nothing to report . Stay on alert . Roger . Inaho ... Why ? What 's the meaning of this ? ! Who gave those Landing Castles authorization to dock ? ! it was ... I did . Highness ? Count Marylcian requested a personal audience with Princess Asseylum . I gave them permission to dock . a princess of Vers . Why would you do such a thing ? ! Let 's be off . It would be poor manners to keep our visitors waiting . We are both humbled and delighted that Your Highness has granted us an audience on such short notice . I am most grateful to you both for bolstering our orbital defenses . I expect that you would wish to go down to Earth and expand your domains . We shall leave the conquest of Earth in the hands of our like-minded brethren . Your Highness needn 't worry . I see . That is good to hear . there is a matter of even greater import to discuss . who is charged with safeguarding the moon base and Your Highness ? There is no cause for concern . I have taken over those duties . I have come to beg you to consider giving me the honor of serving at your side . I have – Terran ! This is a fortress that flies the flag of the Vers Empire . but would nonetheless approve . dare to think you can inherit that post using this turmoil as a pretext ? To have one of low blood set foot inside the castle where a member of the venerable Vers imperial family dwells is a fact that cannot be tolerated ! One who does not possess a Landing Castle is unfit to call himself count . not in the least ! then ? my Herschel or your Tharsis . I hereby challenge you to a duel ! Dawn of Intrigue

That freaking idiot matthews was in here earlier Throwing his weight around . That 's our elected representative you 're talking about . Any progress on the break and entry in the lab ? Facial recognition threw up a koen west . - He runs a bar . - West ? Yeah . They 're brothers . I checked with births and deaths . Well , they 're half-brothers , to be precise . You want me to go into this bar , pick this guy up ? Not yet . I need to think about that . I might head into the zone . I 'll need your checkpoint goons to not kick up a fuss . You want me in with you ? It 's pretty hairy in there at the moment . I 'll be fine . I need to talk to you . Those kids can 't stay here . Just concentrate on the doctor stuff . Don 't you patronize me . I just put my clinic on the line for you . It 's under control . - They murdered a man . - They didn 't . Well , that 's not what the authorities are saying , And they 're going to come after them . All these people in the zone if they shut it down ? It 's a setup by the ca . Even if it is , it still means That the clinic could get dragged into it . They have to go . Doc ! You need to see this ! Okay , um , hold him . Hold him , hold him . We need to flush his blood out . Alcohol . It 's in the cupboard . Eve : Okay . Freaking shaver bastard . Just go home , mate . Oi ! Dude , what the- - Hey ! That 's enough ! The frig are you ? I said that 's enough . Go on .

Step away ! On the ground ! - Okay . - On the ground ! - Where 's the subbie ? - Through there . Stay down . Suspect is still at large . We are dead . So , is the hair staying ? - There 's so much of it . - Frankie : Yes , that 's the idea . That 's what they 're paying for . God , my man likes me waxed within an inch . That 's because he 's only got an inch . So has she got a name yet ? Clients can call her what they like . My name is araluen . We don 't use our real names around here . Good .

You hear me . Not a word to anyone about what happened . Yeah ? He 's awake . We need to send a clear message That kind of behavior won 't be tolerated . Will do . How you going in there ? Illuminating . I 've got to go . Impressive call you made about his clan . Where 'd you get that ? I 'm just interested in a lot of different things- - New , old , ancient , spiritual things . Things that aren 't any of your business . It 's lucky for that kid I 'm a nosy bastard , isn 't it ? - You knew my uncle . - I did , through the arts scene . I 'm a collector . Jimmy had a good eye . Rubbish . Jimmy wouldn 't know a dot painting From a rembrandt . Why were you at his funeral ? - I was a friend . - Never mentioned you . - Maybe you weren 't listening . - Go to hell . Uncle jimmy was the closest thing I had to a father . You people thought he was a drunken old fool , But I took care of him and he opened up to me , Shared things with me . We learned together . Wasn 't his place to do that . Jimmy thought it was . This is not yours to play with . It 's not a game . You 're a smart man . Be smart . You think what it might mean To combine ancient teachings With knowledge of the future . And then ? Do what with it ? What the hell did you and jimmy do together ? Things I would never have dreamed were possible . I know you think jimmy was special , But I wouldn 't trust everything he gave you . He chose the wrong cleverman , didn 't he ? Why 'd your uncle give you that club ? It 's all connected , isn 't it ? It was meant to be my brother waruu . There 's been some cosmic stuff-up in the universe . I mean , he 's been training to become the cleverman ever since he was two . Cleverman ? Is that why you can do stuff ? I mean ... You can heal . You can see things . You lied when you said you saw nothing The other day , didn 't you ? You saw something then . And you saw something again this morning . What did you see ? You 're seeing shit about me . What is it ? I hear a sound- - some kind of alarm . I see the bar . I see you . I see blood . Maybe you 're right . Maybe they did get the wrong guy . Frankie : Chin up , pet . Yes . Oh , that 's lovely . What do you think ? Real ? Frankie : Every follicle . Now , look at me . - Hey . - Aw , you suck . Shut up . It hurts . Aw , man , harden up . - Freaking hairies . It 's all their fault . - Hey , stop it . You 're better than that . Your friend 's still in there . You want to see him ? - Hey , man ! - You look good , bruz . Man , we thought you were gone . What 's with the clean skin ? They made us do it . Who ? The fellow who busted us out . He organized everything . That fellow 's my dad . I 'd say you 've earned that . Thanks . Why did you come into the zone today ? I came to take you to lunch . Really ? I 'm glad you did , or we would have had Two dead kids on our hands . I like watching you work . We make a good team . Yeah , we do . My line in the sand ... I never stopped to consider what it meant for you . Are you sure you 're okay with that decision ? I mean , really okay ? I 'm okay . You don 't need an heir ? I hate a competitor . Jarrod : I have to duck back to the network . - I know . I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . Can 't be helped . It 's called a lemon twist . Makes the drink look pretty . It means that we can charge more . Hey , hey , hey . Stay with me . Come on . We were getting somewhere . What do you want ? I 'm good for the moment . I wanted to say how sorry I am about your uncle . I was a friend of his . I 'd like to offer my condolences . You sure you don 't want a drink ? You know , you look a lot like him . Must be the beard . It 's a dead giveaway . It 's the eyes . It 's an unusual thing , heterochromia iridus . What do you want ? Your uncle 's eyes were caused By something else , though , weren 't they ? It 's the same reason your eyes are different colors . Who the hell are you ? Jimmy and I worked together . He shared his knowledge with me , And it was very lucrative for him . I 'd like to offer you the same opportunity . I 've got everything I need right here . Really ? This bar ? You have worlds at your feet And you don 't even know it . I didn 't catch your name . I 'm koen . Jarrod slade . Maybe a drink another time . Hey ! Oh , it 's all right . I know a back way . You want to come with me ? Load them up . - Ready , bruz ? - Yeah , bruz . Right , set ... - Struggling . I ain 't struggling . Struggling . All right , you can sleep up there for tonight . Latani ? You made it . You 're safe . Mom ? Dad ? They killed jyra . I know . Why did you attack them ? Dad told you to keep your head down . What did you think would happen ? You were outnumbered and they were armed . You blame me ? If you had just listened ... Jyra would still be alive today . So , what ? We outlive them dad 's way ? In case you haven 't noticed , that hasn 't been working . You all right ? Hey , frankie 's happy . You must have done well . Remember when they arrested you ? I saw it on the tv . I 'm sorry about what happened to your little girl . Do you have children ? Yeah , I got two . I got a boy that 's five And a little girl , sophie , six . Mine was jyra . That 's a pretty name . I have other children , too . Just before you ask , I can 't help you . Please . I need to be with my family . Just don 't ask me again . What 's going on in there ? On the government 's containment policies . Three subhumans broke out Of protective custody early today , Murdering a containment center guard In what appears to be emerging as their trademark attack- - The victim left with his heart torn from his body . It brings to date three confirmed deaths . There appears to be no pattern in the attacks , The victims differing in age and circumstances . You old bastard . What were you wrapped up in , eh ? I got your feed here . Sorry it 's late . You want to eat it now ? Want a glass of water ? - How are you doing ? - I 'm okay . - What about you ? - Yeah , good . Pair of liars , aren 't we ? I wish you 'd get a second opinion . Nah , it 's meant to be . Can 't muck with karma . I love you . You 're always looking after me . I appreciate it . - I 'll see you soon . - Mm-hmm . Have a feed . Don 't you have a hug for your mum ? I 've been calling you all day . Is there anything I need to know ? Babe . Hey . Come on . - will you please let me in ? I just want to talk . Dickson : What am I up against , huh ?

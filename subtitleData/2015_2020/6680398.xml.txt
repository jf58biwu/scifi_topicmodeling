 Previously ... My pain , it grows more tedious . It will be like drifting off into a deep sleep . Oh , brother . The prince is a canny , slippery man . We have thwarted him all we can . All that plotting . How the bloody hell did we end up here ? The prince will have his battle on Culloden Moor . It is the promise of history . Promise me that if the time should come , you will go back through the stones . I promise . - Claire ? - Frank , I 'm back . I 'm carrying another man 's child . - Yes , Roger ? - May I go outside to play , Father ? I don 't think I 've ever heard him call you father . Children accept the world as it is presented to them . I want us to be together . Are you sure about this , Frank ? We will raise this child as our own . Yours and mine . _ Good morning , Mrs. Peel . Good morning , Steed . The door 's open . Social visit ? That 's it . Happened to be passing by , thought I 'd drop in . The coffee 's over there . Not enough flexibility in the wrist . Weight on the wrong foot . Friendly advice . There doesn 't appear to be any cream . The cream ... is in the kitchen . Oh . You really should get back to your guests . They keep asking for you . Thank you all for coming . It would 've meant a great deal to my father . And if you knew him , you know that he was not one to leave anything to chance , including the toast for his own wake . " To Death , the jolly old bouncer now . " " Our glasses let 's be clinking . If he hadn 't put other out , I trow , to-night we 'd not be drinking . " - The Reverend . - The Reverend . Your father was such a delightful man . I 'll always remember his sense of humor . Thank you . The Reverend helped so many people . - He 'll be sorely missed . - Thank you . Would you excuse me , uh , for a moment ? Oh , of course . Roger , so sorry to hear about your loss . - Thanks very much . - It 's nice to see you . - My condolences . - Thanks very much . Appreciate it . - You have my sympathies . - Oh , thank you . I 'll speak to you in a minute . - Tom , how are you ? - Yeah , not bad . - Good . - Listen , Roger , I 'll be here for you . - I appreciate it . Thank you . - Okay . Are you Roger Wakefield ? Yes . Definitely . That 's me . Yes . - I 'm afraid I haven 't had the pleasure . - Roger . It is . Well , I can 't believe it . After all these years . Uh , I 'm sorry , but do I ... do I know you ? Oh , of course , you wouldn 't remember me . Last time I saw you , you were about , oh , seven or eight years old . I 'm Claire Randall . I was an old friend of your father 's . Ah . Very sorry to hear about his passing . - Thank you . - I see you 've met my daughter . Actually , no , we haven 't been formally introduced . Brianna . The daughter . A pleasure , Miss Randall . We were staying with relatives down in London when we heard . His heart , I believe ? Yes , yes , uh ... very sudden . I 'd just seen him at Christmas , and he was in high spirits . I hadn 't seen your father in a very long time , but I ... I was very fond of him . - So was Daddy . - Oh , yes , of course . Uh , my late husband , Frank ... they were very close . Randall . Frank Randall , of course . I remember you now , yes . Claire . You ... you 're a nurse , as I recall . Oh , yes , I was . I ... I 'm a doctor now . She 's being modest . She 's a surgeon . Hm . Uh , Bree and I are ... are visiting from the States . Oh , I thought I detected an American accent . - Boston , to be exact . - She 's a history major in Harvard . Really ? I 'm on leave from the history department at Oxford . Oxford . Impressive . Is Mrs. Graham still in the Reverend 's employ ? I haven 't seen her yet . Sadly , we lost her a few years ago , but her granddaughter Fiona is here somewhere . So many things are the same , and yet things are so different . There are quite a lot of memories here . Would you excuse me ? - I 'd like to take a look around . - Yeah . - Uh , first time in Scotland , then ? - Uh-huh . And will you have much time to take in the sights while you 're here ? We only came up for the day so Mother could pay her respects . We 're meant to be headed back to London this evening . Oh , that 's a shame . Beautiful , wild country . I was always curious about Scotland . It was a special place to both my parents . Roger ? I beg your pardon , but it 's time to say good-bye . The Browns are leaving . Oh , yes , of course . Thank you , Fiona . Uh ... you 'll excuse me for a moment ? Yeah . Mrs. Graham had warned me not to spend my days chasing a ghost , and so I hadn 't . But now that I was here , the ghosts were starting to chase me . Thanks again . Thank you . Arthur , love to your wife . Hey , sorry she couldn 't come along . Well , we should be going . Not all the way back to London ? Oh , no , we 'll drive as far as we can and then stop at a pub for the night . There 's plenty of room here if you 'd like to stay . Oh , we couldn 't possibly impose . You wouldn 't be . In fact , I 'd welcome the company . It 's a big house . Sounds better than jolting down the wrong side of the road in the dark . Besides , it 'll give me a chance to take in the sights . I hear it 's a beautiful , wild country . All right . - Uh , just so long as we 're no bother . - I 'll fetch your bags from the car . - The guest room 's just ... - Top of the stairs . I remember . I couldn 't sleep , so I helped myself to a dram . I hope you don 't mind . Oh , no bother . I 'll have one with you . Ah . That 's better . You know , I pestered him for years to throw things away and clean up the clutter . Now I can 't bear to part with any of it . There 's a lot of history here . Mm-hmm . Not just the family 's , either , but Scotland 's as well . The college here in Inverness have asked me to donate his library to their archives . I 'm not sure I 'll donate everything . He was quite fond of several rare editions of Prince Charles Stuart and the Battle of Culloden . Culloden . Mm . Final battle of the ' 45 . My ancestors fought and died there , actually . Really ? Yes , my true name 's Roger MacKenzie . My parents were Jerry and Marjorie MacKenzie . The Reverend adopted me after they were killed in World War II . MacKenzie . I used to know quite a few MacKenzies ... once upon a time . It 's a common name here . May I ask you something personal ? How did you do it ? Finally say good-bye ... to that one person you loved most in all the world ? Truth is , I 've never been very good at saying good-bye , but that 's the hell of it , isn 't it ? Whether you want to say good-bye or not , they 're gone , and ... you have to go on living without them . Because that 's what they would want . Thank you for the whisky . Good night , Roger . God , you are so like him . I tell you , the ... the army is not ready for battle this day . We must retreat to safer ground before the British realize their advantage and destroy us all . You are my Thomas . It was the Apostle Thomas who doubted the Lord who had risen from the dead ... Not until he felt the wounds , pressed his fingers where the nails had been . The Lord said to him , " Because you have seen , you believe , " but blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe . " But today is the day , James . And mark me , before this day is over , I will make a believer of you . It 's a blessing ... Colum didn 't live to see this dark day . It 's the prince . The Battle of Culloden will happen today , just as history foretold . Sentries have spotted the advance guard four miles out . Cumberland has broken camp . His army is marching on the south side of Kildrummie Moss . Go inside . Inform Lord George . There 's only one thing left . One possibility . What 's that ? Not here . Fort William . Built in the 1600s . The Gaelic name for it is An Gearastan Dubh , " The Black Garrison . " It was used by the British as a command post and prison , intended to control the " savage clans and the roving barbarians . " Military history isn 't really my specialty . It was your father 's , though , right ? The Reverend has a couple of his books in the library . One of my earliest memories is dropping an ice cream cone off the ramparts of Fort Ticonderoga , while he held forth on the heroics of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys . Ethan Allen ? " I regret I have but one life to give ... " Nathan Hale . Common mistake . Never quote American history to an American . The Revolutionary War is practically a religious text in Boston . With George Washington as the Messiah and , uh , Benedict Arnold as Judas , no doubt . Benedict Arnold is a deeply misunderstood historical figure . I thought you didn 't like military history . We Randalls are a verra complicated clan , laddie . That is absolutely the worst accent I have ever heard . Do you remember my father very well ? Bits and pieces . He was a snappy dresser . Wore his hat down over one eye , very dashing , and , um ... seemed very kind . He was . The kindest man in the world . Your mother seems very kind as well . My mother ... lives in another world . This place gives me the chills . With good reason . Many Scottish prisoners were flogged here . A lot of blood was spilled on this ground . My father built this place , ye ken . His blood and sweat are in this stone . Are you playing with the apples ? What 's your name ? This is my wee Jamie . This is your uncle , mo chridhe , the one you 're named after . Congratulations , your bonny little lass ... Little Margaret Ellen Murray . 'Twas my grandmother 's name . Claire , Claire , they 're ready . - They 're giant . - Oh , my goodness . You were right , telling us to plant them . I 'm beginning to feel like ... I actually belong here . I knew ye belonged here with me , since the first time I laid eyes on ye . " Come and let us live , my Dear . Let us love and never fear . " " Then let amorous kisses dwell , " on our lips , begin and tell " a Thousand and a Hundred score , a Hundred and a Thousand more . " This battle , this war ... everything that 's about to happen ... it all depends on Charles . Aye . And what if he were to die ... now ? Right now . Then the battle wouldn 't happen , and this whole bloody rebellion would die with him . Christ . I have this . It 's yellow jasmine , and it 's poisonous . It 's what Colum took last night . Colum ? He begged me . He knew that his time was near . He took his own life ? Claire , that 's a mortal sin . He wanted a quick and peaceful death , and I gave it to him . Charles has been suffering with scurvy for weeks , and I 've been treating him regularly with tinctures . I could put this in a tea . Kill Charles Stuart ? The way it works ... it would be like drifting into a deep sleep . And he would never know ? No one would ever know . Do you have any memory of an incident that happened with my parents when they were here ? How do you mean , " incident " ? Something big that happened between them when they were here staying with your father . I was just a wee lad . I don 't remember all the details , but ... I do recall finding Mrs. Graham crying out in the tool shed . There were a lot of broken things lying about , and I think she said your father had lost his temper and smashed everything up . My father smashed ... Yes , but that wasn 't the reason why she was crying , I 'm certain of that . My father definitely had a temper , but he kept it tightly under wraps . When did this happen ? What year ? Your mother said I was seven or eight when she last saw me , so it must have been ... 1947 or ' 48 . My father kept this ... lockbox on the top shelf of his closet . I knew where he hid the key , so one day , I opened it . There were letters in there from your father . Mostly academic stuff , but ... there was this one letter . The Reverend mentioned an incident involving my mother and my father , and the way he phrased it made me feel like it was something big , maybe something terrible . Definitely something he didn 't want to spell out on paper . It scared me for some reason . I put the letter back in the box , locked it , and never looked at it again . My father kept a journal . He wrote in it every night after supper . There 's boxes of them in the storage room , if you wouldn 't mind getting a bit grubby . Grubby doesn 't bother me . You should see my bedroom . That didn 't come out right . No , no , but I ... I , uh , I get your meaning . So I 've traced the chain of title for the estate known as Lallybroch or Broch Tuarach and found this . It 's the earliest document we have in our files , a deed of sasine , transferring title to the property from James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser to James Jacob Fraser Murray . The property was transferred in 1745 , witnessed by Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser and Claire Beauchamp ... well , it 's a bit smudged , but I think her surname 's Fraser as well . Yes ... I believe it was . And , uh , after that ? Various Murrays , it seems . The property stayed in that family for many generations . I 've , uh , made you a copy , so this one is yours to keep . Thank you . One last thing . Is it possible to do a genealogical search ? Aye , what 's the name ? Roger MacKenzie . How was your date ? It wasn 't a date . Well , you have to admit he is rather handsome and intelligent . Not to mention , he has a lovely physique . Who says " physique " ? Stop . Of course , there are those deep blue eyes . Maybe you should date him . Hmm . So where did you end up going ? Fort William . Have you been ? Once . Didn 't much care for the place . So what did you do today ? I just puttered around the village . Places you and Daddy went before ? Some . Do you miss him ? Of course . Sometimes it doesn 't seem like you do , or ... you ever loved him . What a thing to say . Well , did you ? Love him ? I did . Make no mistake , this would be cold-blooded murder you would be carrying out . To stop a slaughter . If we kill the prince , we take one life to save thousands . Jamie . Lord George requests yer presence near the east dyke . Ye 've to come at once . They 're calling the men to form lines . Aye , on my way . We would need to move quickly . I could put this in his tea now and give it to him . Ye ungrateful son-of-a-bastard . You filthy , whoring witch . I 'm meeting the curator on the second floor . I shouldn 't be long , then we , uh , can go start the great excavation of the Reverend 's journals . Will you be okay ? - Yeah , sure , I 'll hang out . - Okay . And we can no longer allow their vision to dictate ours . When Scotland was united with England under a single crown , it was the beginning of the end for us . We lost more than our independence . We lost our spirit . The government in Westminster , the bankers in the city , the newspapers of Fleet Street have stolen our money . Our voices ... our futures . Where are the rulers of old who knew how to look after their people ? The kings who have become legendary ... Arthur of Wales , Richard the Lionheart , Prince Charles Edward Stuart ... Our Bonnie Prince ? We 've all heard of the Battle of Culloden ... But imagine how different Scotland would be now if we had won . Where is our Bonnie Prince Charlie today ? I am ... Bonnie Prince Charlie . Yes . You are Bonnie Prince Charlie . Yes . We are Bonnie Prince Charlie . Aye . Scotland ! - Thank you so much . - Thank you . Cheers , and take that . Yes , thanks . I liked your speech , but wasn 't it the Scottish king James VI who united the crowns ? And Queen Anne , his Scottish granddaughter , who signed the Acts of Union ? Aye , but Anne was raised Anglican , already under the influence of Westminster . Prince Charles and his father King James wanted to undo all that . Sounds like they would 've been just trading one king for another . Charles was Catholic and a Scot . Unlike German Geordie and the Hanovers , his loyalty was to us . Maybe . You 're an American . Are you a student here ? Brianna Randall . Just visiting . So why are you here ? I 'm a history student . I like watching history being made . There you are . Roger Wakefield . Gillian Edgars . There 's another big rally later , near here . We 'll be making history . Cheers . Tall fellow , wasn 't he ? Wasn 't that tall in real life . He could have been great . He had the name , the cause , the support of good men willing to lay down their lives for him . They 've taken a fool , turned him into a hero . And what 's that thing inside there ? Hmm , not sure . Looks like a dragonfly , maybe ? Dougal . It 's not what ye think , man . No ? Not what I think ? What , that , uh , that woman was urging ye to foul murder , the murder of your prince . - No . - Dougal , you have to listen ... Shut your mouth . I kent you were a traitor the first time I clapped eyes on ye . Easy now . Ye see , Jamie ... ye place yer trust in someone , ye know ? And ye ... ye give into them ... ye give into them with your heart and your soul , and for you to then plan the murder of our beloved prince ... - No , Dougal ... - Christ . Christ . I 'd rather be hung , drawn , and quartered . I would . Oh , Jamie . Ye 've just ... ye 've betrayed us , you know ? Ye have . All of us . Your people . And worse than that , ye 've betrayed Scotland herself . No . And you . You 're nothing but a lying slut , who would lead a man by the cock to his doom , with your claws sunk deep into his balls . Claire is my wife . Ye 'll no speak ill of her , even in your anger . Anger ? Anger ? Oh , no . What ye 've done to me ... we 're past anger . You 're tired , Dougal . Cold and hungry . Leave now . No ! Claire . Jamie , come to me and I 'll kill you quick for your mother 's sake . Dougal , we can talk this through . Just stay down . Just stay . I 'm so sorry , Uncle . How long since anyone 's been in this place ? Ages , I expect . Are these his journals ? Aye . Aye , if there 's anything here about what happened back in 1948 , we should be able to find it . What was that ? Probably a rat . Here , use that . At least you won 't be taken by surprise . Too late for that . Would you rather I did a rat satire ? A what ? A rat satire . An old Scottish custom . If you had rats in your house , you could make them go away by singing to them and telling them how poor the eating was where they were and how good it was elsewhere . You 're kidding , right ? Dinna stay and gnaw my wellies . You just made that up . Obviously . Any good rat satire must always be ... original . Wow , after that performance , there shouldn 't be a rat within miles of this place . Randall . Now there 's an heirloom for you . A letter of commission in the army , signed by His Royal Majesty , King George II . Dated 1735 . " Jonathan Wolverton Randall . " I remember Daddy talking about him . He 's one of our ancestors . Here 's a letter from your father . The Reverend was doing research on the Captain ... and my father told him to abandon the project . " He 's not the man I thought . " Odd . Then let 's take these boxes into the library . Oh , God . Oh , Christ . Rupert . I 'd have torn out my one good eye , if it could have stopped me seeing this . But seen it I have . Aye , ye have . Wait . There 's one service I ask of you . Give me two hours . There are some things I need to tend to . Ye understand ? And then ? And then I 'll come back and answer for what I have done . I give ye my word . Two hours . Grant me that , before ye speak . For the memory of the friendship that I once had for you , which you have now murdered as certainly as you did my chieftain ... I 'll give ye two hours , and then I 'll damn your soul to the fiery pit . You can see how flat and open and boggy it is . The Highland army was completely exposed , and they then charged into the teeth of musket fire , cannons , mortars . And it was very , very quick and very bloody . In effect , Culloden marked the end of the clans and the end of the Highlander way of life . Are you a Fraser ? Yes . I am . I swore I 'd never set foot on this horrid place , but here I am ... and you 're here too . Or your bones , at least . I 'm not going to cry ... Because you wouldn 't want that , and besides ... I 've come with good news . You have a daughter , Brianna . Named after your father , just as I promised . Jamie , I ... was angry at you ... for such a long time . You made me go and live a life that ... I didn 't want to live . But you were right , damn you . Brianna was safe ... and loved ... and raised well . But sometimes , oh , when she turns and the light catches her red hair or ... I see her smile in her sleep ... It takes my breath away ... Because I see you . She was born ... 7 : 15 on a rainy Boston morning . And that 's everything . Everything I can remember . See ? No tears . Bet you didn 't think I could do that , did you ? That day at Craigh na Dun ... We said a lot of things , but there was one thing I didn 't say . Couldn 't . I haven 't for ... 20 years . But I 'm here , and now it 's time . Good-bye , Jamie Fraser . My love . Rest easy , soldier . " Kidnapped by the Fairies " ? " Claire Randall , " wife of noted historian Frank Randall ... " Holiday in Inverness . Car found . Police thought she was possibly murdered . " Well , obviously not . She turned up . Three years later . " Mysteriously found wandering , dressed in rags , disoriented , incoherent . " I think we 've found your " incident . " What about the Reverend 's journal ? Maybe he says more about this . Are you sure you want to do this ? You may not like what you find . I want the truth . No matter what . Oh , there you are . Would you like some tea ? What I 'd like is to know exactly what you 've been doing the past two days . As I told you , I 've just been ... Puttering around town , collecting herbs . Is that all ? What 's going on , Bree ? Did you see him ? Who ? My father . Did you see my father ? What kind of question is that to ask ? Not Daddy . No , he 's dead . I know that . I 'm talking about my father , the man you had an affair with . The man you were with for three years . Bree . It 's complicated . No , it 's pretty simple , actually . Newspapers say your " miraculous return " was in April 1948 . I was born in November ' 48 . I did the math , and it turns out you were three months pregnant when the fairies brought you back to Daddy . Bree ... I found something else in the Reverend 's correspondence . Not sure what it means , but ... Oh . I 'm sorry . I should let you ... No , stay . It 's your house , and you haven 't lied to anyone . I think we should talk alone . He 's my friend , and he stays . All right . But I think you should sit down . Yes . There was a ... another man . And I loved him very much . And yes ... he was your real father . You lied . All my life , you 've lied to me . Frank didn 't want you to know . Don 't you dare blame this on him . He wanted to raise you as his own , and I agreed . It 's why we moved to America . So we could put all this behind us . Until you found an excuse to visit Scotland ? Is that really why we 're here ? So I could have some kind of surprise introduction to my real father ? No . It 's not possible , anyway . Because he has no interest in meeting his daughter ? Because he 's dead . I promised Frank I wouldn 't tell you about him , so for 20 years , I ... I haven 't uttered his name out loud . But now you know , and I need to tell you about him . About your real father ... Jamie Fraser . I don 't want to know anything about him . Not one single thing . Bree . Brianna . You told me you just wanted the truth , no matter what . This is it . Most important ... Jamie loved you very much . Even though he never met you , he loved you with all his heart . And he would have raised you ... Well , if it wasn 't ... If it wasn 't ... for the Battle of Culloden . I 've killed Dougal MacKenzie . Huh . Canna say I 'm that surprised , only that it took ye so long . What 's to do , then ? What is it ? A deed of sasine . It conveys the title of Lallybroch to James Jacob Fraser Murray . Giving the place over to your nephew . Aye . This protects Lallybroch and keeps the estate in the family , safe from the Crown , to be held in trust by Jenny and Ian until Wee Jamie is old enough . But it 's dated from a year ago . Aye , before the rebellion , before ... I was a traitor . I just need the signature of two witnesses . Go fetch your master ink and a quill , lad . Quick about it . Go . Will ye have me take it to Jenny ? No , I 'll have Fergus take it . - Me , milord ? - Aye . Aye , you 're to ride to Lallybroch . Ye 'll leave now . This must reach Madame Murray without fail . It is worth more than my life or yours . I don 't want to leave you , milord . - I refuse . - Ye must . Not just for the deed , but no matter what happens here today , it 's important someone remembers . You understand ? I will not fail you , milord . I know ye won 't . So how long have you been cooking up this story ? No , I ... I know this must sound crazy , but ... Did you really think I would swallow this ... fairy tale ? Do you think I 'm still five years old ? It is not a fairy tale , Bree . The man I grew up with , who loved me for 20 years , isn 't my father . My real father is some 6 ' 3 " redheaded guy in a kilt from the 18th century ? What is wrong with you ? Listen to me . Frank was your father in every way that matters except one . He didn 't make you . Jamie and I did . You 're just like him . Your hair , your mannerisms . Oh , he would have loved you and raised you if ... If it hadn 't been for the Battle of Culloden ? Oh , my God , stop . It 's true . Here . Look at this . Here . The deed to Lallybroch . Claire Beauchamp Fraser . It ... it 's my maiden name , my signature . Just admit it ! Admit that you are not a perfect person . Own up to the fact that you fucked someone else while you were married to Daddy , just like a million other bored housewives . I was not bored , and what Jamie and I had was a hell of a lot more than fucking . He was the love of my life ! Why are you doing this ? Bree , I ... I 'm doing this because it 's the truth . Only two people know what the truth really is , and one of them is dead . Too bad it wasn 't you . You stop for nothing , except to sleep . And if you do , hide yourself well . You 're a soldier now , mon fils . I love you like a son . Like our own son . That doesn 't mean anything . I don 't know what it means , to be honest , but the Reverend obviously thought it meant something . She 's insane . That 's all that matters . Now , don 't lash out at me , but that deed of sasine did look authentic . So some woman back in 17-whatever had the same name as she does , or she read about someone and is fantasizing it was her own life . Or what if there 's ... something to her story ? Keep that up and I might just lash out at you after all . Now , look , you told me that you could never get close to your mother , that she lived in another world . Well , maybe she 's trying to show you that world . So you believe she traveled 200 years into the past ? Through a stone ? It 's not important if I believe it . She believes it . I 'm just saying , maybe we should keep an open mind . How ' bout we keep an open tab instead ? There were ghosts around me everywhere since I 'd arrived . The face was unmistakable : Geillis Duncan . I remembered the date she 'd told me at the trial , the year she came through the stones . 1968 . This was no ghost . Geillis was here ... a younger version of her ... but she was here . Hello , uh ... I 'm looking for Gillian Edgars . Is this her residence ? Aye . And what is it you want with her ? Well , I 'm an old friend of Gillian 's , Claire Randall . You must be ... Greg . Her husband . I 'm not going to be in the area long . Do you know where she might be ? I 'd love to say hello . Aye . She will likely be with the Roses , but I ... I 've no kept up . SlÃ inte . The Roses ? The White Roses of Scotland ? Aye . Aye , bloody Nationalists . She spends all her time down the Institute , day and night , spending ' all my money on courses . Folklore , they call it . She filled up a million notebooks with her findings . Why not just learn to type ? Get a job if she 's bored ... that 's what I told her . So she left . It 's been weeks now . So you say she 's been gone for weeks ? Aye . That 's what I said . Like ... if ye do see Gilly , tell her to come home , eh ? Tell her I love her . Of course . Honestly , this pub 's been here since 1820 , and ... Gillian , hi . You missed a great rally earlier . I 'm sorry we missed it . Roger and I are just having a whisky . Aye . It 's been a bit of a tricky day . My mother 's insane . Mm . A sentiment echoed by daughters everywhere . Maybe I 'll catch you again at the next rally . Afraid I 'm leaving tonight to ... further the cause . But don 't stop asking the hard questions . That 's the way the world changes . For hours I read Geillis ' notebooks . I tried to make sense of the convoluted pages . They contained formulas about the art and science of time travel . Unlike myself , Geillis had studied and prepared for her journey . I was stunned to learn she believed you must have a human sacrifice to move through the stones , and gemstones to protect and guide you . From what I could tell , Geillis planned to pass through Craigh na Dun , and soon . Sadly , I knew how that trip would end : with Geillis burned on a pyre in Cranesmuir . I had to try and stop her . Gather the Frasers of Lallybroch together and get them out of here . There 'll be pell-mell on the moor , wi ' troops and horses moving to and fro . Nobody will try and stop you wi ' the British in sight and the battle about to begin . Tell them the order comes from me , and they 'll follow without question . Lead them off the moor and away from the battle . Set them on the road to Lallybroch and home . Are ye sure ? Aye . This battle is already lost . No matter how righteous , it was doomed from the start . We 've done all we could , but now it 's over . I 'll not have my kin die for nothing . And what are you to do ? I 'll take Claire to safety . Then I 'll turn back ... back to Culloden , and fight till it 's done . I 'll guide yer men to safety and set them on the path home . But ken this : when ye return , I 'll be waiting here to fight by yer side . No . No , I said I 'll not have ye dying for nothing . I won 't be . I 'll be dying with you . I don 't want to argue . Let 's just agree that I have a father who ... isn 't Daddy . I don 't want to discuss your whole time travel delusion , but I do want to know more about this ... Jamie Fraser . Tell me about him . Of course . All right . Uh , he was tall and had red hair just like yours . His father 's name was Brian , and that 's where your name came from . He spoke French , and he loved to play chess . Uh , he had a sister , Jenny , who 's your aunt ... It would take too long to tell you everything about him . But I promise I will . Today , I visited his grave on Culloden Moor and was telling him all about you ... This is the part where you lose me . I didn 't intend to fall in love . In fact , I ... I fought against it . But I couldn 't deny what I felt for him . And I tried ... but I couldn 't . It was the most powerful thing that I 've ... ever felt in my life . How is she ? Well , we 're talking , at least . A fair improvement on shouting . Well , do ... do you know Gillian Edgars ? Not really . I know she gave Brianna that after ... Brianna 's actually met her ? Yeah . Gillian 's great . I mean , she 's a little crazy on the whole Scottish nationalist thing , but I liked her . Do you know where she is now ? No . Why ? Are you sure ? I need to find her . It 's important . We ... we just ran into her at the pub . Um , she said she was leaving town tonight . Something about going somewhere to " further the cause . " Didn 't sound like she would be back . She 's going through the stones . We 're not talking about this again . Gillian Edgars is Geillis Duncan from the witch trial . This is her . She is the one who saved my life , and if I can stop her going through the stones , then perhaps I can do the same for her . Except I can 't . Why not ? Because of you . Me ? When you told me that you were a MacKenzie ... oh , I looked up your family history . Your seven-times great grandparents were William and Sara MacKenzie . They couldn 't have children , so they were given one to raise as their own . That child belonged to Dougal MacKenzie and Geillis Duncan . So you 're saying that my ancestors are actually the war chief that you spoke of and the witch ? Don 't drag Roger into this . He has the same right as you to know who he is . If all this is true , then we have to stop her , don 't we ? If she 's going back to be burned alive . You 're kidding me . But what if she never goes back , never meets Dougal MacKenzie , never has their child ? What if you 're never born ? How I can not be born ? I 'm here . I can 't just evaporate . I don 't know how this all works . Roger , you 're not buying this , are you ? I don 't know ... but just to be on the safe side , I say we find her . Warn her , at least . Yes , I ... I could warn her not to draw attention to herself in the past . Do you see what 's happening here ? Roger , you are feeding her delusions . Brianna . Maybe I am . But this could be our chance to make her actually face it . Face what ? Gillian . See what Gillian says about all this . And what if Gillian is as crazy as she is ? What if she really thinks that you can travel through solid stone to the past ? Well , then maybe we all get to watch her slam her head into a five-ton block of granite . Either way , this gives us a chance to put a stop to it all . - Okay . - I 'll get my keys . Where are we going ? Red Jamie won 't get far , but ... but you . I can save you , and I will . Well , we can leave together . Now . We could sail somewhere , anywhere . The country is roused . The ports are closed . I 'm no afraid to die , Sassenach . A musket ball , maybe a blade . It 's better than the hangman 's noose or the wrath of the MacKenzies . I 'm a dead man already , so I choose the battlefield . No . Then I will stay here with you . No , no , you won 't . At the witch trial , if I 'd have gone to the stake with Geillis , would you have left me ? Left you ? I would have gone to the stake with you , to hell and beyond , if it had gone to that , but I wasn 't carrying your child . You can 't know that . It 's much too soon . It ... Oh , Sassenach , you have not been a day late in your courses in ... in all the time since ye first took me to yer bed , but it 's been two months now . You kept track ? In the middle of this bloody war , - you kept track ? - Aye . How long have you known ? Not long . This child ... this one is all that will be left of me ... ever . But now , we must go , so I beg you , Claire ... No , no , I can 't leave you . You heard me give my word to Rupert , and you made me a promise to spare Randall 's life . You ... you promised me that if it came to this , ye 'd go back through the stones , back home . But you are my home . And you are mine , but this home is lost . And now you and the bairn ... you must go to a safe place . To a man ... A man that could care for you both . No . - No , I ... - Claire . Claire , there 's no time . That 's her husband 's car . It 's this way . Come on . What is that smell ? It smells like a fuckin ' barbecue . Geillis , no ! Where did she go ? Oh , my God , she ... she went through the stone . She went right through it . Can you hear that ? That buzzing ? Aye . It 's getting louder . Oh , my God . Roger , go get help . How will I explain all this ? How can I go back ? To Frank . All that I leave to you . Tell him what you will about me ... About us . It 's likely he 'll no want to hear , but if he does ... Tell him I 'm grateful . And tell him I trust him , and tell him I hate him to the very marrow of his bones . The buzzing . It 's so loud . I 'm not ready , Jamie . I 'm not ready . Come with me . Come with me through the stones . Na , I can 't . You could try . You hear it , right ? The buzzing ? I don 't hear anything , Claire . Even if I could ... go back through the stones ... It 's not my place . My destiny lies on Culloden Moor . But I 'll find you . I promise . If I have to endure 200 years of purgatory ... 200 years without you , then that is my punishment that I have earned for my crimes , for I have lied , killed , stolen , betrayed ... And broken trust . But when I stand before God , I 'll have one thing to say to weigh against all the rest . Lord ... you gave me a rare woman ... And God , I loved her well . It has begun . Our wedding gift from Hugh Munro . You keep it with you . Blood of my blood . And bone of my bone . As long as we both shall live . Come on . This ... belonged to my father . Give it to the bairn , when he 's old enough . I will name him Brian , after your father . I love you . I love you . And I you . Good-bye , Claire . It 's true , then . Everything you said is true . Yes . Was that her husband ? I think so . And so someone has to die to travel through the stones . I mean , is that how it works ? Geillis believed that she needed a human sacrifice , but no one died when I went through . Wait . Is this the last place you saw my father ? Yes . I believe you . I don 't understand it , but ... I believe you . No more lies . From now on , I only want the truth between you and me . All right ? Oh , you 're so like your father . Yes . Only the truth from now on . I 've called the police , anonymously , of course , and God knows how long it 'll be before they get here . Roger . Tell her what you found . Some research the Reverend did at the request of your husband ... your husband Frank . I 'm not certain if he ever sent it on to Boston . Well , what does it say ? After the battle at Culloden , a few Jacobite soldiers , all seriously wounded , took refuge in an old house ... for two days , then they were all taken out to be shot , but one of them , a Fraser of the Master of Lovat 's regiment , escaped execution . There were a lot of Frasers on the field that day . But ... only five Fraser officers , and four of them have their names memorialized on a plaque in the church in Beauly , so ... we know for certain that they were killed . Who was the fifth ? James Fraser . My father . Jamie . He didn 't die at Culloden ? Well , he meant to die , but ... He didn 't . He survived . He ... he survived . If that 's true , then ... I have to go back .

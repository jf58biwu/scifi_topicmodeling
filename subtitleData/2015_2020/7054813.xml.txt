 We 're onto something , gina . We have to get everyone back together . You have to tell her the truth . This is our new boss , eric . I noticed I 'm missing a finger . Have you heard from gerry ? I will find a very special job for you , gerry . Car accidents involving animals . Are cover memories used to mask alien encounters . I 'm special agent alex foster . We have an assignment for you . Just have a couple questions about jonathan walsh . Would it be weird to say no ? Thanks for taking the time to meet with me . I went to the police station , But it was ... I guess closed ? Well , it 's after hours . Aand we 're closed on sundays , too . Well , don 't tell all the criminals . I won 't . But that 's actually very dangerous . You should be open all the time . I 'll just talk to somebody about that . Listen , I just wanted to talk to you about jonathan walsh . Whoa . That 's a lot of takeout for one person . I just , got divorced , So maybe I 'm doing a little overeating . Are you single or ... ? Pass . Yeah . Anyway , it 's just me now . Here , all alone . All the time , pretty much , when I 'm here . Jesus , glimmer . Who 's out there ? I don 't know . Keep quiet . So , I understand the last time walsh was seen . Was at the home of a ... Gina morrison . There was an explosion ? Yeah . A gas fireplace exploded and some local nut . Claimed that walsh and a robot did it . Imagine an exploding robot . The guy 's wackadoo . Do you mean richard schultz ? Yeah , yeah . Ii keep tons of files on all the starcrossed people . And richard " nutjob " schultz is one of them . That 's my nickname for him . That 's very clever . Yeah , we actually have our own nicknames at the fbi . Yeah , like " witness " or " cooperative local policeman . " Yeah , that 'd be me . So , can I see those files ? Well , the files are in here . 'Cause the station is trying to go paperless 'cause of climate change . Well , I can tell you what I will do , Is put the whole list together for you tomorrow . And send it to you in the morning via email . I 'd do it tonight , but my computer broke 'cause I spilled sauce on it . Did you hear that ? I just saved your ass , walsh . Yeah , glimmer , you nailed it . Come on ! Just work ! Work ! Why are you not ... ! The cube wants to see you for your evaluation . Shit . Are all humans as fun as this guy ? Come on , cube . You 're the fun one . Please , call me eric . We 'll finish this later , gerry . Gotta do an evaluation . Blah . Yeah . You 're just letting him walk around like that ? He should be strapped to a table ! We are doing things a little differently now . If you give the subjects a little agency , You get better results . He 's getting his dirty human fingers all over everything . It 's our job to make him feel welcome . Gerry is our guest . Our guest ? We captured him . Can you leave us alone for a second ? So , jeff , how 's it going ? You seem stressed . Good . Iit 's going good . I 'm fine . I mean , you know , we are shortstaffed , You know , and I am covering for everyone else , so it 's ... You 're struggling . No , no , no , no . Ii 'm excelling . Ii 'm doing the work , the dream work , Which is teamwork . Yeah ? Yeah . Hey , jeff ! Shut up . Classic jeff . I don 't know why eric likes you so much . And if I see you touching any of my shit , I 'll zap you . Hey , so , how did your evaluation with eric go ? I don 't trust that guy . Mergers are never good . I think he 's out to eliminate us . What ? That 's crazy . You think so ? Why haven 't you called me back ? You were worried about me ? Aww , that 's nice . No . You clearly haven 't listened to messages 12 through 17 . I 'm not worried . I 'm angry . Listen , there 's an fbi agent in beacon . She wants to talk to you about me . She can 't be trusted . Wow . Somebody sounds a little paranoid . What are you afraid I 'll tell her ? It 's not about what you 'll tell her , But who she 'll tell and who might be listening . When she tells them whatever you t ... All right , fine . Maybe I 'm a little paranoid . But that doesn 't mean they 're not after me . We 'll talk about it more when we see each other in person . And when will that be exactly ? It 's a surprise . I know how you like surprises . I don 't like surprises . See ya , buddy ! Jon ... Jerk . I 'm going in . No , I 'm not waiting . I 'm going in ! Gerry ? ! Okay , that 's good . Come on back . Okay , now cut . I am cutting ! No ! Let me get ... Just let me do it . No ! No ! I can do this ! No ! Just let her do it . I 'm not gonna hit the car ! Gerry hasn 't been to work for three days . That 's not so unusual for gerry . I mean , remember when we didn 't notice . That he was in jail for a week ? Yeah . Don 't mind me . It 's just a routine reptilian face mask check . Yeah . Okay , you check out . So , no one 's concerned about gerry ? Well , if it makes you feel any better , I was gone for almost the exact same amount of time . I don 't think anybody was looking for me . Did anybody even notice ? No . Where 'd you go ? Just iceland . Ooh ! With somebody that I barely know . I could have been murdered ... Not than anybody asked or cared , Or even asked me about my hair . Yeah . It looks nice . It 's subtle . Anyway , I guess we should probably look for gerry . Just in case he got murdered . Thank you for that . Because I wasn 't thinking that he was murdered . But now I kind of am . What ... what is going on ? Are you guys cool with this ? Stop it . Cut your fingernails , richard . Hey , sorry I 'm late , but jonathan walsh contacted me . What 'd he say ? He wants to meet , But he says the fbi is in town . And they shouldn 't be trusted . Of course you don 't trust them . 22 % of the fbi are reptilian . Of course , walsh is reptilian , too , so how can you trust him ? I don 't know . I kinda do . Knock , knock ! Hi . Hello , everyone . I 'm special agent alex foster , with the fbi . I knew you guys would finally catch up to me . Been on the run since ' 77 . Richard , call my lawyer . He 'll know what to do . No , ma 'am , I 'm not after you , Although I 'm very curious what it is you did in ' 77 . I 'm after someone else . I did bring muffins . They 're from bakery town . Supposed to be ... The best bakery in beacon . The best bakery in beacon . Jinx . You guys remember " jinx " ? Yeah . Okay , we don 't need your fbi muffins up in here , lady . Right , guys ? I 'm guessing you 're richard ? Maybe . For what it 's worth , There 's a poppy seed in here . How did you know that poppy seed was my favorite ? Spy . Ii think what richard is trying to say is that . This is a private meeting , where we share private things , Of a very sensitive nature . And you are gina ? Right , the leader ? There 's not really a hierarchy here , But , yes , I 'm the leader . You don 't have to be humble about it . She 's the leader . Listen , I know the fbi has a reputation . You all think we 're a little sneaky and we can 't be trusted , And we 're the " least fun " of the federal agencies . But I 'm just here to ask some simple questions , okay ? Super easy . Okay , cool . We have nothing to hide . Right ? Great . I am in beacon . To find jonathan walsh . I think some of you may know him ? Why do you want to ask us about walsh ? I think you know the answer to that . The whole exposÃ © you wrote on his whitecollar crimes . I really like your writing , by the way . It 's crisp . Really ? Yeah . Thank you . Actually , you know what ? I don 't even need to talk to all of you . I 'll just pick a couple of you randomly , Off the top of my head . Gina , ozzie , richard . Hello , don . I was just tending to my plants . I find vegetation really softens a workspace . Yeah , I , - I failed the mission . You think so ? Yep . I have neglected my job , And even taken a human job instead , making coffee . Because I fell in love with one of my subjects ... kelly . What ? And we went to iceland to meet my dying mother . And my mother is not dying . Or on iceland . Or on earth . I should 've been here doing my job . I 'm prepared for any punishment you see fit to give me . Don , you gambled on love . Who hasn 't done that ? I have just one question . On a scale of 1 to 10 , How incompetent is jeff ? Jeff jeff ? I said , " clear your mind . " I 'm trying . What 's an " yvonne " ? She 's an angel , and I miss her . I mean , it 's been awesome chilling out in space . With you and don and a talking cube . But I 'd trade it all just to see her one more time . So , how 's it going in here ? Shitty . Good . He won 't shut up , And these tests are impossible . When the subject 's conscious . So , how 'd it go with eric ? Did he tear you a new one ? No , he was actually really understanding . And forgiving about the whole thing , And then we even talked about the heartbreak . Of forbidden love . But you violated one of the most fundamental . Mission directives ... Consorted with a subject . Yeah , but eric says it 's six sides to every situation . That 's brilliant . He must be a genius . He 's a cube . He 's a floating square . He 's a good cube . I wish he was my dad . Do you want to fight me now ? See ? Look at that . That 's about , like , Five days ' worth of mail there . Yep . I just don 't think it 's time to panic yet . You know , like you guys didn 't do when I was in iceland . My god . Okay . Why did you go to iceland ? I don 't want to talk about it . Are you sure ? Why do you keep bringing it up , then ? Well , because I ... Hey . No dead body inside , so that 's a good sign . How did you get in there ? Margaret picked the backdoor lock . Yeah . It 's a little something I picked up in ' 77 . Are you comfortable ? Is your chair comfortable ? Do you want to take my ch ... You know , why don 't we switch chairs ? No , I 'm a therapist , so I ... Iii see what you 're doing . I use this tactic . Tactic ? You 're using sincerity . To get me to open up and relax and start talking . You are really very good at it . Thanks , gina . You 're welcome . So , how often does ozzie talk about jonathan walsh ? Nnot that often . So he does talk about him ? Great . What does he say ? Tell me everything you know about richard . Richard ? You 're gonna have to be more specific . I know a lot of richards . I mean , you know , there 's richard nixon , Richard dean anderson , Richie polaro from high school . Ooh ! Richard simmons . Richard schultz . From group ! Yeah . We call him " dicky . " I barely know the guy . Well , gina told me you acted as his lawyer . During his divorce proceedings . Look , he was going through a hard time . I was just being a friend . So , you 're his friend ? Now , see , I thought you didn 't know him . Hi , richard . Hi , alex . You see what I did there ? You 're not the only one who can be " casual " . And " friendly " and ... " beautiful . " Richard , there are two types of men ... Men who run away from danger and men who run toward it . Which one am I ? Sounds like you ran right toward it . That night at gina 's place . Yeah . Yeah . I mean , I had to do what I had to do . Walsh is a monster . Will you help me find that monster , richard ? She 's like some kind of fbi voodoo witch ! So , richard and I had a great idea . We think we should go to gina 's place . Mmy place ? Yeah , ' cause it was walsh 's last ... Last known location . Known location . That 's right . Okay , so , I charged in here not knowing . What would happen , and this is where it happened . Where you say the robot exploded ? Yes . It doesn 't look like there was an explosion . Gina , have you vacuumed the room recently ? Yes . Is it a crime that I 'm a neat freak ? No , but I will need to take your vacuum cleaner . When I go ... evidence . Okay , so help me out here , richard . Why did you tell a different story . To gina 's insurance adjustor ? You said that a gas fireplace exploded . I ... I said it because ... I asked him to say that . My policy doesn 't cover exploding robots . If we could just focus on the robot . I mean , I was in love with her , And she was in love with me , but all right , that 's enough . This is getting crazy . I think you 're all trying to cover something up , And that something is walsh 's whereabouts . Ozzie , you worked for him . Gina , he was in your house for god knows why , And , richard , you were the last person to see him , weren 't you ? Where do you keep your vacuum cleaner ? In my cleaning closet , in the hall . Richard ! Aah ! There you go ! Wait a minute ! No , no , no ! Richard , richard , richard ! I got you ! Richard , richard ! I got you , you reptilian ! I got you ! What the hell are you doing ? ! Richard ! No ! Open the door ! What is wrong with you ? ! She 's an fbi agent ! Ozzie , think about it ! Walsh disappears , she shows up out of nowhere ! This is walsh in disguise ! No ! You don 't lock people in closets . No ! You 're making a huge mistake . Run ! Richard schultz , you are under arrest . For false imprisonment and assault of a federal officer . This is my legacy ! Guys , grab her face ! Now ! Don 't grab my face . Nobody 's grabbing anybody 's face , But if you could not press charges against richard , That would be great . My job is to find walsh , And if I have to lock up a bunch of lunatics . To get to him , I will . Richard will die in the big house ! Guys ! Please don 't leave me with the reptilians ! Please ! Okay , okay . Okay , look , if we could all just ... Just calm down for a second . Can I talk to you for a minute ? Look , what if , hypothetically , Jonathan walsh contacted me . And , hypothetically , I could help you find him ? Would that change your mind ? Wow . Break out handcuffs , And suddenly people have information . Are you saying you can get me to walsh ? Maybe , but I 'm gonna need something from you . So , jeff , I 'm reading your reports . On this new gerry subject . As you know , I 'm very interested in his brain . He 's a fun one , right ? Sure . Fun . But your reports , on the other hand , Not so fun , and rather confusing . You should do them again . Have you looked at don 's reports ? They just seem to flow . There 's an ease there . I know ease doesn 't come naturally to your kind . " Your kind " ? Yeah . He said that ? That sounds pretty charged . Nothing I do seems to satisfy him . It 's like he 's out to get me . Sounds like my dad . Never gave me a break . Maybe you just need to stand up to eric and say , " dad , I 'm my own man now . " I can 't say that to eric . I believe you can . Don 't touch me . I 'm sorry , it 's ... I ... I thought you ... We were friends . Why are you so worried about gerry ? Because we were supposed to meet up at a diner . And he didn 't show up , and you don 't just disappear . When you 're in the middle of bundling insurance policies . Wow . You feel really strongly about insurance . Does , um , insurance feel strongly about you ? Um ... Well , I thought so , But now I 'm not so sure . " The collected works of gertrude stein . " Gerry , who are you ? Sometimes , you think you know somebody , And then it turns out they 're a horrible pathological liar . Who 's not who they say they are . Honey , what happened ? Is this about iceland ? Thank you for asking ! Yes . I went to iceland with somebody that I barely knew , And that somebody was ... Me . You know , I don 't know what I 'm doing . Or who I am or what I want . Or where I 'm going . Or what I 'm doing . Well , those are very , very good questions to ask . Is there anything that you 're passionate about ? When I was a kid , I wanted to be a dancer . Really ? Like ballet ? No . Modern dance . The only pure expression of raw emotion . Is there anything else that you like to do , Like literally any ... Anything else ? Or ... or modern dance is good . Yeah . Okay . I did my part . Now you do yours . He 's free as long as you bring me walsh . Deal ? Deal . Don 't make me regret this . You know , your feelings are actually your own . Thanks , gina ! You didn 't seriously make a deal with the reptilian ? You 're welcome . What are you ... Why ? What ? Yeah . Thanks for getting me out . Yeah . So , I read your revised report on gerry . I think it 's good , right ? Flowy . Listen , jeff , this ship needs to be whipped into shape , And from the moment I saw you , I knew you were the problem . I look at you and I think " shortcut . " I think " lazy . " Lazy ? I 'm the only one on this ship doing anything ! Yes , but you do it so poorly . Now leave . No . This is the best that I can do . If you don 't like my work , maybe you can just tell me that . Rather than mindeffing me . Maybe I 'm not doing a good job . Because maybe you 're not communicating . What you want very clearly . Your complaint has been registered with the federation . Wait . I didn 't mean to ... No , I appreciate the candor . Thank you for your feedback . Gerry ! Hey , eric ! You wanted to see me ? You know it ! Come on in here , you big ol ' goof . What 's up , buddy ? You know , same old , same old . The people connected to walsh are a little weird , But I have a good lead . It won 't be long until I find him . Good . But when you find him , you contact me first . With his location . Wait . What ? Why ? Agent foster , just do as I say . That 's an order . What the . Looks like you 're going to beacon . The rest of the fbi cabal are getting nervous . Terminate walsh . I 'll take care of that traitor . Does it have to be today ? 'Cause we have the book club coming over and ... It 's in your hands . Okay . I will take care of that traitor soon . It feels weird . I can 't move . That 's because I 'm deep inside your mind . They used to implant deer and other woodland creatures . To cover memories . I find my method more effective . You can trust me , gerry . I can trust you . Well , you shouldn 't . No one should . Hey , pretty lady . Gerry ? Yeah , it 's me ! Agh ! Jesus , my eyes ! Gerry ! They used to implant deer and other woodatures . To cover memories .

 Previously on Stitchers ... Cameron : I have a history of watching people I care about get into bad situations or worse . You don 't talk about your mother much . What was she like growing up ? Can I call you later ? I don 't think that 's a good idea . As far as you and I go , we 're just on totally different planets . Got a call from a friend of mine at the DOJ . My name has come up in some meetings , and there might be an opening there . What I 'm about to show you stays between us . Quincy : Well , clearly we have a problem . Or an opportunity . Maggie : How long have you been in contact with your father ? Do you know how hard it is for Kirsten to keep seeing her mother like that ? And where , exactly , does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger cooped up ? How could you betray me ? Kirsten , I didn 't mean to . I just ... Can we please talk ? Hey ! Listen to me ! Just ... I can 't stand the thought of losing you and it being my fault . I guess that means you love me . Stinger : Feel anything , honey ? When you find Mommy , you bring her back . Hey . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Kirsten . - Hey . - Hey . You were doing it . Oh . Again ? What kind of dream was it ? Oh , I don 't know . I don 't remember my dreams . - You don 't ? - No . Not since I was a little girl . Well , thanks for the movie night . It was fun . Now , don 't try and change the subject . I still think something got tweaked in your brain when you were stuck in that stitch with your mom . That was so long ago . If that was it , we would know by now . ( sighs ) You know , I 've been thinking , I ... I know a top neurologist . She 's not in the program . She 'd keep the results between us . No running off to Maggie . Just us ? I 'm not risking us again . So , yeah , just us . Let me make an appointment . ( sighs ) Okay . - Quincy . - Hmm . Are you awake ? I 'm awake now . We 're doing great , right ? You and me ? You okay ? What 's wrong ? Oh , nothing . - You sick ? - No . - You pregnant ? - No . Your parents coming to town ? ( laughs ) No . I got the job offer from the DOJ . I 'll be in the Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism ... in Washington . DC ? I asked if I could stay in LA . I can 't . And this job ... It 's everything you worked for . Yeah . Are we good enough to make the move together ? ( phone rings ) ( sighs ) Hey , Ivy . You blew me off . I 'm so sorry . I had dinner all ready to go , but something came up . I feel terrible . I want to make it right , so ... Breakfast ? I 'm buying . I 'm busy . Okay , yeah . I guess I deserve that . But ... I am free tomorrow night for dinner . I have yoga . Um ... Come by around 8 : 00 ? Okay . Cool . ( phone beeps off ) ( knocking ) It 's 7 : 30 in the morning , Linus . If this isn 't about a case , bye-bye . - Not about a case . - Bye-bye . You have to get over Amanda . ( groans ) Why ? You and I are going on a morning beach run . - That 's not gonna happen . - Yes , it is . Even if I have to drag you out in your jammies . - I see what you 're doing . - Mm-hmm . - I get it . You 're a good friend . - I 'm a great friend . Come on . Beach run . ( groans ) Fine . Good ! Now let me see your game face ! Aw , come on ! You can do better than that . Yep ! That 's the one . ( flies buzzing ) ( theme music playing ) ♪ Take me inside ♪ ♪ Take me inside ♪ - Oof ! - No joke . Body was found in Soledad Canyon . Woman walking her dogs found him . She was way out there ? She 's got mean dogs . LAPD was canvassing for witnesses , so far nothing . He didn 't just fall from the sky . Or did he ? Say hello to Fred Overmyer . US Air Force , Classified Unit . - What 's with his face ? - Camille : Unclear . The ME said the initial tox screen came up negative . - You spoke to Amanda ? - Salt . Wound . She e-mailed . She 's running more in-depth screens now , so cause of death is still unknown for the time being , but she 's fairly confident it was murder . How can she be so sure ? Expressions usually relax at death . So no sign of a struggle , no witnesses , no tire tracks , no footprints , no forensics . Maggie : And no room for error . The Air Force classified Fred 's missions . They classified the base he was flying out of . Whatever happened to him , it 's not something they care to share . The Air Force might not want to , but Fred will . - Hey . - Yeah ? - What 's going on ? - Nothing . We 've been working together for a while now , Quincy . Tell me . Stephanie 's taking a job in DC . She wants me to transfer there . Oh . So what do you wanna do ? I 'm happy here . But ... Look , I 'm going today to San Francisco on NSA business . I can ask about a transfer to DC , so you know your options . - Thanks . - Okay , hey , and listen . I haven 't told the team about Stinger and Ivy yet , so let 's keep that under wraps for now . Got it . Lights to 20 percent , please ! I need a go-no-go for stitch neurosync . - Life-Sci ? - Go . - Sub-Bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Go . - Medical ? - Go . - Comm check . One-two , one-two . - I hear you . Mission clock set to five minutes , please . Okay , Kirsten , I feel the need . - For what ? - The need for speed ! For speed . Okay , induce stitch neurosync on my mark . In three , two , one , mark ! It 's 1985 . Fred 's visiting a guy at his house . He seems out of it . Catatonic . There 's a woman here . Yeah . He 's stuck in the past . Aren 't we all ? It 's not the same flying without Reed . Flying without you Reed . Frontal limbic network 's all lit up . Fred 's feeling guilty about something . Man , this shouldn 't have happened . Not to you . Fred 's apologizing . Survivor 's guilt , I think . Okay , found another memory hotspot . Standby , Goose . Moving you ! Fred 's in an Air Force control room . Man ( on radio ) : Tower , we have traffic for Genesis 2 . Ten miles ahead , 40 degrees . Negative , Genesis 2 , all clear . Just you up there . They hear a pilot . He 's asking about other planes in the area . Fred : Wait , I see it . Can you say the type of aircraft ? Pilot : Negative . I 've never seen anything like it . ( alarm beeps ) It sounds like the pilot thinks he sees a UFO . Pilot : It 's there ! it 's there ! It 's coming right at our windshield ! Turning left , 30 degrees ! Kirsten : Fred 's with Rudy . But he 's not sick . It must be before the accident . He 's a pilot . His uniform says , " RG-F117 . " I 'm telling you it was right there . - It came right at me . - Could 've been a satellite . No way . It was a UFO . The man from the house is the pilot that saw the UFO . I got to report what I saw . Do that , you 'll never see the inside of a jet again . Or worse . He 's gotta learn the real truth about aliens and UFOs . Fred 's with a female officer now . He wants to tell the other pilot the truth about aliens and UFOs . Government conspiracy much ? More like ridiculous much . - Skeptic much ? - Man of science much . Cameron : There 's no proof that ... I 'm being pulled to another memory . Still in the past . Fred 's taking the pilot into a restricted area . Oh , my God . - What ? - There 's an alien on a table . Wait , a dead alien ? An imaginary alien , I imagine . No , it 's a real alien . ( alien screeches ) It 's ... it 's attacking them . ( alien screeches ) The ... the alien 's alive . No wonder Fred 's memories are in the past . That was the critical event in his life . Okay , I think I got a lockdown on the death memory . Good , because this is all flavors of nuts . Stand by for warp , Star Kid . Kirsten : Fred 's older . I 'm at the scene of his death . Welcome back to the 21st century . Death memory in ten seconds . Get what you can as fast as you can . He 's waiting for someone . Wait . I see lights . - A car ? - No ! They 're coming from the sky . - ( beeping rapidly ) - Three seconds . Cameron : Time to phone home , Kirsten . Make the bounce . ( beeping rapidly ) Did you see who killed Fred ? Yeah . Aliens . - Aliens ? - Yes . - Aliens . - Yes . - Aliens just killed ... - ( snaps pencil ) What part of " Yes , aliens killed Fred , " do you not get ? The part about aliens because they don 't exist ! So , while Maggie jets up to SF , here is what we are going to do . You guys are going to look into Fred 's whereabouts . Phone records , credit card statements leading up to the time of Fred 's death . You are going to work up a filter to quiet the guilt from Fred 's past . I will update Maggie . See if she can look into whatever Fred was up to with the Air Force lately , and we can try to put an ID on that pilot and female officer that Fred spoke with . Maybe they can shed some light . Why don 't I research UFO sightings in the Soledad Canyon area last night ? Ooh . Check out the MUFON site . They 've got the most legitimate reports . Man of science . I am shocked ! Do you honestly think the Stitchers program is the only secret our government keeps ? X-Files , Cameron . X-Files . Saw the whole series growing up . That wasn 't real . Oh , but my first crush , Gillian Anderson , was as real as it gets . Duchovny was a distant second . Okay , we got it . You 're that person . Me , too . Mostly . There 's no empirical proof of aliens . - Linus : Cameron 's right . - Thank you . There 's only deductive proof . I hate you . There 's a hundred billion planets in our galaxy . There are 500 billion galaxies . Some of ' em must have life on them . Yes , but not life that has evolved so much faster than we did , and are now zooming across the galaxy killing old Air Force officers . When did I become the mature adult here ? What about what Kirsten saw in the stitch ? Yeah , what about that ? But there have been some things that you 've seen recently in stitches that weren 't real . Fred 's memories were real . I cross-checked the data . Okay , okay , okay . So , you believe . You ... believe . You , I 'm still stunned . Quincy : President Eisenhower did have a pact to share secret technology with aliens . Et Tu , Fishy ? I binged conspiracy shows after I was shot . Look , maybe Fred was going public with proof that aliens exist , and he was killed because of that . Or he was sharing government secrets with the Greys and got caught . - Greys ? - Aliens . Keep up . Or his murder has nothing to do with aliens , and everything to do with whatever else Fred was working on , and my guess , it was some secret military technology that went all sorts of wrong . Oh . Wait , you have empirical proof of that ? Hmm ! Funny . No . But we 're gonna find some , so ... go . ( people on video gasping ) Child : Awesome ! Kirsten : The trees are identical on both sides . - It 's been Photoshopped . - Oh , good catch . Hey ! Just got an ID on that pilot that was with ... Oh my gosh ... Fred . He was discharged from the Air Force in 1985 after suffering a nervous breakdown . - His name 's ... - Rudy Grant . - Cameron : How ... ? - He 's a major UFOlogist , like world famous . Hey . That 's Rudy Grant . He was all over those shows that I watched . He 's ... An alien crackpot , yeah . Just heard . And he is definitely the pilot that I saw with Fred in the stitch . Well , then maybe he knows something about this . Checked into Fred 's bank . Found a regular deposit of thousand bucks cash into his account every month for the past 20 years . Fred was getting paid under the table for something . Could have been selling Air Force secrets . If that 's what it was , he had help . He was paying a guy named Pog Newcomb half his take every month with money orders . Never met a Pog before . Well , you 're about to . Go with Fisher and interview this oddly named Pog , and we 'll go have a chat with Rudy Grant . Rudy : Oh , I 'm not surprised Fred was murdered . Why is that ? Because of what happened to us . Which was ? Which was me and Fred were attacked by an alien . - At Dreamland . - Dreamland ? Roessell Air Force Base . California 's answer to Area 51 . So , can we discuss this alien attack ? If that 's what got Fred killed all these years later , why not kill you too ? Well , Rudy 's too high-profile , too public . It would set off all kinds of alarm bells . Rudy 's got quite the following in the UFO community . Oh , so I 've heard . You 're not a believer . No , sir , I am not . I get it , I get it . ( sighs ) Any yahoo with a digital camera , tinfoil , maybe even a drone , and some scotch tape can pull off a convincing hoax . But there is , there is life on other planets , and you give me a few nights out here , and I will prove it to you . Our house is on a ley line . - Right , honey ? - That 's right . It 's tectonic plates lined up , sort of like a UFO highway . Rudy : Hey ! One believer out of two isn 't bad . You know what , you should come , too . We 'll barbecue . ( Rudy chuckling ) Yes , yes , yes . Fred 's murder . The question I have for you is when is the last time you guys saw him ? Ooh . Couple of months . Arlene ? Oh , well , he did stop by your book signing . Remember ? That 's right . That 's when it was . Did you guys notice if anything was bothering him ? No , I didn 't . Then , did he say what he was working on ? No , but if he did , I couldn 't talk to you about it . You know that . Oh , come on . Can you at least tell us where Dreamland is ? For Fred , yes . But on one condition . Be careful when you go out there . Because if the aliens don 't get you , the Air Force will . Hmm . Wonder what you would look like in a uniform . Well , the uniform I could pull off , but I 'd never let them touch my hair . ( phone chirps ) Oh , it 's the , um ... neurologist . She wants to meet tonight . - Your place . - My place ? I told you I want to keep this off the grid . Oh , yeah , okay . Text her back . Tell her we 'll be there . ( indistinct chattering ) Where you going ? Fred was out there in the stitch . The alien autopsy was down that hallway . Kirsten , our NSA badges got us this far , but the MPs with the very large guns told us that we need to stay here . Since when do we ever do what we 're told ? Never , but ... Kirsten . You better be getting coffee . You better ... Kirsten ! ( whispering ) : Kir ... She 's not getting coffee . Not getting coffee . This is it . You 're gonna be disappointed . Disappointed . Not disappointed . Definitely not . - ( rifles cocking ) - MP 1 : Freeze ! MP 2 : Don 't take another step ! Don 't move ! Agent Goodkin . Agent Clark . Colonel ... Spencer . Two things saved you . One , you 're with the NSA . Two , that flying saucer you saw ? It 's a declassified Air Force prototype we could never quite get off the ground . Heavily documented . Good thing for you , 'cause if it was classified tech , you 'd be in some very hot water . Is that what happened to Fred Overmyer ? What do you know about his death ? It 's tragic . Fred was one of our best pilots . Other than that , I 'm in the dark . - Wish I could help . - What was he working on ? That 's classified . Classified as in the alien autopsy that was performed here ? Alien autopsy ? Are you serious ? We heard about it . ( scoffs ) From whom ? An unstable nut bag who thinks that every weather balloon over Dreamland is a close encounter of the third kind ? Actually , I heard it from Fred . When were you in contact with him ? That 's classified . That 's ... actually true . ( sighs ) If you think his murder is connected with his work here , you 're wrong . We have reason to believe he may have been selling Dreamland secrets . Oh , Fred would never do that . He was a true patriot . There is something else . We need the name of a female officer that worked with Fred in 1985 . Our personnel lists are classified . Show them out . The next time you wander off inside Dreamland without proper credentials , these NSA badges won 't do you any good . - Sign . - Yep . Mm-hmm . Texting and walking don 't mix . - ( sighs ) - Amanda ? Ugh , you said her name . No . Cameron . They just finished up at Dreamland . They find any aliens ? No , just a flying saucer . Seriously . The Air Force said it was just a " prototype . " Got to love alternative facts , right ? Hey , you okay ? You seem a little more wooden and reserved than usual . - You and Steph good ? - We 're fine . Yeah , okay , yeah , your lips say fine , but your face tells a totally different story . Fisher , come on , it 's me . The safe space ? We tell each other stuff . Stephanie got a job offer in DC . She 's gonna take it . Wow , um ... Are you ... are you gonna go with her ? Maggie 's looking into a transfer for me . I can 't imagine not being here with you guys . I hate to admit it , but you 're my family . ( chuckles ) Dysfunctional family . Best kind . Come on . ( indistinct chatter ) You 've been taking in 500 bucks a month for 20 years . A hundred and 20,000 in total . Not illegal . Well , not if you claim it on your taxes . Which you didn 't . We checked . I 'm trying to cooperate here , and you had to go there ? So , now I 'm gonna need to see a warrant . Camille , how much do you think this place makes ? Hmm . Daily , weekly or yearly ? Hmm . Not sure . Maybe we should check his books . See if he paid taxes on that . Like I haven 't heard that threat before . All right , well , try this one on . Since I walked in here , I noticed one , two , three health code violations . Oh , just one second , Fisher . - ( crunches ) - Ah . Four health code violations . I think this place should shut down for a little bit . Get cleaned up . I am too old for this schnitz . The man who was giving you money was found murdered . What was he paying you for ? He wasn 't paying me . I was just the middleman . The cash was going to my sister . - We 're gonna need to talk to her . - You can 't . Peggy died a couple months ago in an accident at work . Where 'd she work ? Aerospace somewhere . She didn 't talk about it much . We done here ? For now . We 'll be in touch . ( bell rings ) - Aerospace ? - Accident ? - I think not . - No schnitz . - The female officer ? - I think maybe . - ( phone ringing ) - Hey . - Linus , I 'm with Fisher . - Hey , got the advanced tox results . Looks like Fred died from a lethal dose of nerve toxin . VX ? Like Kim Jong-un 's brother ? That was his half-brother , and it wasn 't VX . - Toxin 's unknown . - Okay . How soon can the ME nail it down ? - Don 't say her name . - Amanda tried . - You said her name . - ( groans ) I 'm sorry . The ME tried . The toxin is unknown . Let Cameron know what you found . I already did . He said we 'll pick it up in the morning . He and Kirsten had to be somewhere . You nervous about this ? Hmm ? No . Are you ? Look , I ... finally got over you telling Maggie where my mother was , and I 'm ... even wiling to give her a little bit of slack , too , - but you cannot ... - Tell anyone . I won 't , I won 't . I won 't . I promise , I promise . ( sighs ) ( knocking ) Hi . You must be Kirsten . Yes ! It 's nice to meet you . Come in . I 'm sorry . Cameron didn 't tell me your name . Of course he didn 't . - Marian . - Dr. Marian . Actually , it 's Dr. Marian Goodkin . Hello , Cameron . Hi , Mom . How 've you been , Cameron ? Good . You ? Oh , there it is . That superficial grin you do so well . Gee , Mom , I 've missed you . Sarcasm as refuge . My mother likes to analyze me . Oh , only when I see him , which I don 't . Often . At all . She also likes to lay on the guilt . Real thick . She 's almost as good at that as she is at neurology . - Such a flatterer . - I was trained by the best . Yes , you were . By his father . Who I hear you saw recently . Some sort of incident at the prison ? Yes , but ... - he 's okay now . - Excellent . Well ... give a hug . And then get out of here , so Kirsten and I can get on with it . - Um ... - She 'll be fine . Go . Are you sure ? ' Cause , you know , I can ... I can wait . No , I 'm fine . I 'll ... I 'll see you tomorrow . Come and sit down . Cameron tells me you two work together . Mmm , we do . So , how long have you been dating ? He reached out to me for you . He 's never done that for anybody . What do you like about him ? Is this part of the exam ? No . Just a mother asking , if that 's all right ? Cameron 's smart . He 's loving and kind , and he always looks out for me . He loves you . He said that ? No , but I can tell . Do you love him ? You 're right . That 's not my business , is it ? Look , I 'd like to run some tests . See what 's going on . So why don 't we take a ride ? We 'll go back to my office . Okay . Hey , you didn 't call me last night . Was I supposed to ? Ah , to yell at me for springing my mother on you . Why ? I liked her . Okay . Well , you don 't have to say that . - I know my mother . - Really ? Do you ? 'Cause she 's actually incredibly insightful . Maybe bringing you to her was a bad idea . I think you 're being too hard on her . She loves you . Okay , well , did she tell you anything ? About you , not me . No . We ran some tests , did some scans . She 's gonna get back to me with the results . All right , well , don 't get too attached . Why ? I thought all little boys wanted to find girls just like their mummy ? I 'm not even gonna dignify that with a response . Hey . I got DMV pics . Any of these Peggy Newcombs the officer you saw with Fred ? It 's hard to say . The memory was from 30 years ago . Hard to say , not hard to do . - Give me a minute . - ( beeping ) On the right , that 's her . Okay . Show me the money . And ... Okay . Here it is . Until two days before her " accidental " death , Officer Newcomb worked in the Air Force chemical research lab at Dreamland . She must be who Fred was with in the stitch . Kirsten : Uh-huh . All right . I 'll see what I can find out about her . Great . Quincy : I understand . Maggie ( on phone ) : The NSA won 't budge , and there 's still a hiring freeze . But it doesn 't mean a spot won 't open up for you down the road . If it 's DC you want , I can put in a good word with the local PD . Thanks for trying , Maggie . Not easy , I know . Call me if you need a shoulder . I 'm gonna need one either way . That Maggie ? Are you going to DC ? Hey , Fisher . - You got a sec ? - Yeah . ( sighs ) What 's up , boss ? Maggie 's notes seem to indicate you knew about this . I accidentally saw it . So , you accidentally read it too ? Maggie asked me not to say anything . - To me and Kirsten ? - To anyone . If Stinger 's in contact with Ivy , I 've gotta tell Kirsten . Not until Maggie gives you the go-ahead . - Okay . - You 're gonna tell Kirsten anyway . - Yep . - Don 't . - I have to . - You can 't . Fisher , the last time I kept something from Kirsten , it almost ruined everything between us . I 'm not making that mistake again . Kirsten : And you just found this ? Few minutes ago . I haven 't even told Maggie I know . Kirsten , say something . What are you gonna do ? Talk to Ivy . Make her tell me what 's going on . No . No way . Not until we talk to Maggie . - Talk to Maggie about what ? - Nothing . Doesn 't sound like nothing . Spill . - Quincy : Don 't . - Please don 't . Ivy 's been in contact with Stinger . So no one 's gonna say it ? I let Ivy back into my life . I 'm an idiot . There 's gotta be an explanation . There is . Four words . I told you so . Don 't rush to judgment . Any of you . You 're missing the point . This photo proves that Ivy can get in touch with Stinger , something she said she couldn 't do . She said that she didn 't know where he was , not that she couldn 't get in touch with him . Maybe he reached out to her first . Either way , she 's a risk . - I 'll talk to her . - No , you won 't . Kirsten : Fisher 's right . You can 't talk to her about this . - I 'll do it . - Cameron : Okay , hold it . I agree with Camille , but we are still very much on a case here . That refractory period 's up and Fred 's gonna hit his " best by " date . So , Kirsten . ( sighs ) Yep . I 'm back in 1985 . Fred 's with Peggy at Dreamland . Soft landing . Turning and burning . Kirsten : Fred 's in a bookstore . Present day . Rudy 's signing books . Arlene 's here . Freddy boy . Yeah . Could you get me four fresh ones for his grandkids ? Four fresh ones for his grandkids . Rudy , you need to know the truth . Fred 's telling Rudy he needs to know the truth . The truth about what ? That alien attack at the base was a prank . A prank . That alien attack at the base . A prank . ( woman laughing ) Man , Rudy 's gonna laugh his ass off . Well , make it quick . It 's hot as hell in this thing . Kirsten : The alien attack was staged by Fred and Peggy . She pretended to be the alien . Me and Peggy didn 't think you 'd freak the way you did . You know , the breakdown . Shall I make it out to Sam or Little Sammy ? You hear me ? I 'm gonna make it out to Sam . The money you 've been giving me I 've been sharing with Peggy . The guilt 's been eating at me , Rudy . Rudy 's been giving Fred that money . I can 't take your money anymore . Of course you can . It 's your story , too . No , it was a lie . - It was a lie ! - It wasn 't . Rudy 's getting upset . He still thinks that the alien was real . Fred : This ! This . The aliens , UFOS ... it 's all lies . - Arlene : Enough ! - Fred : It 's a fraud ! He 's a fraud . ( both grunting ) Enough ! Enough , that 's enough ! Just get out of here . Just go . I 'm where he died . I see the lights . ( spraying ) - ( choking ) - Death moment in three seconds . Time 's up . Make the bounce . - ( beeping rapidly ) - ( gasps ) The chemicals were sprayed on Fred by a drone . - So no UFO ? - Not this time . Aw , gee . You mean , sometimes junk science is actually just junk ? Fake UFO . Yeah , that 's too bad . Doesn 't disprove a government conspiracy though . Rudy said that it would be easy to fake a UFO with some tinfoil and ... A drone . You think I killed Fred . If he went public about the fake alien attack , he would 've ruined your reputation . The attack wasn 't fake . I was there . You weren 't . Okay , Rudy , honey . Just calm down . All right , please . You 're upsetting him . You got the chemicals from Peggy Newcomb , didn 't you ? - What chemicals ? - All right , just stop it ! Please . The nerve toxin that killed Fred . Five bucks says you got it from her . - No . - All right , that 's enough . You need to leave . We know that you 've been paying Fred off all these years . That 's right . For our story ! - But ... - Quincy : But that changed , when you found out , he faked the whole thing . That Peggy Newcomb pretended to be the alien , and he was splitting his half of the share with her . That 's not true ! That 's not ... We are not alone ! We 're not ! Look out there . You got the ley lines , right outside . Look ! You 'll see ! I mean ... All right . You believe . - Look out there . - Rudy . Rudy . You said yourself that anyone with some tinfoil , and a drone can pull off a decent hoax . - Yes . - Fred was killed with a drone , and we know you have a license to operate one . I never even flew the ... ( sighs ) You ... you didn 't . Arlene , wh ... Fred wanted to take away everything that you believed in . And I just couldn 't let him do that . So you killed him . You found out where Peggy worked , and you threatened to cut her off if she didn 't give you the nerve toxin . And when she refused , you killed her . Rudy is the love of my life . And I couldn 't just stand by and watch him just swirl into madness again . I had to kill him . I lost you once , sweetheart , and I could not let Fred take you away from me again . No , no . He could never take what 's real away . Never . And what 's real ? That 's us . Arlene , that 's all that matters . It 's just us . Arlene Grant , I need you to come with us . - Come on . - No . ( Arlene crying ) Hey ! I just spoke to your mom . - My test results came in . - Is everything okay ? Well , she didn 't say , but she wants us to meet her at your place at 7 : 00 p.m. Okay . We can do dinner after ? Mm-hmm . Yeah , but I have some stuff to do around here first , so I 'll meet you there ? - Sure . - Great . So you still believe in little green men ? I believe that soldiers wear green uniforms , and some of them work on secret government projects . - So ... yeah . - ( elevator dings ) Hold the door . Thanks . You covered for tonight ? I 'm going to Krav Maga . Between my breakup and Ivy bombshell , I just might put my sparring partner in the hospital . So , yeah . I 'm covered . What about you ? You good ? I 'm gonna go home . I 'm gonna open a beer . I 'm gonna try and figure this whole DC thing out . Which way you leaning ? Everyone gone ? Let 's do this . Hey . - Hey ! - What are you doing ? Sorting out our clothes . You know , we don 't have much winter wear . We 're gonna need to get some . I , uh ... Got us some dinner . Some pad see ew and chicken satay . Thank you , babe . Steph ... I couldn 't get a transfer . That 's okay . You 'll get something else . I 'm sure once I get settled in , I 'll be able to work the network . ( sighs ) I don 't know . I mean , I ... ( clears throat ) I just think maybe we need some more time to figure this out . You mean you need more time . You 're choosing work over us again . Aren 't you ? Hey , Cam . Come in . Kirsten should be here soon . Actually , she 's not coming . - What ? - I told her I was still waiting on some results . She thought it would be a good idea for you and I to see each other again ... by ourselves . To what end ? She said that she couldn 't stand by and watch the man that she loves turn his back on his relationship with his mother . She said that it was something that she didn 't have . Along with my trust at the moment . Look , I don 't think it 's such a bad idea that you and I talk . What happens next ? You and I chitchat for a bit , and then suddenly , everything between us is better ? You 're right . It 's a bad idea . So , dinner ? Actually , I 'm supposed to get dinner with Kirsten . She 's canceling on you . - So ? - Dinner . You know , I do find it a little weird though , that her test results aren 't back yet . Oh , there was just something odd on the EEG and the scan . I sent it back for another look . Uh , should I be worried ? No . It just looked like some sort of reflection . It 's not a tumor . I 'm sure it 's nothing . Come on . My treat . I ... thought we were just gonna talk to Ivy . You know , not break into her apartment . We 're not breaking in . We used her spare key . Linus : Okay . There 's her laptop . You look around . Tell me if you find anything . Okay . To-do list . Spelling tests , lesson plans . There 's nothing here about Stinger . Okay , I 'm duplicating the hard drive , so we can find every reference to Stinger she has on her system . Although , I gotta be honest . I don 't think we 're gonna find anything . Well , we 'll see . Be quick though , okay ? Her yoga class ends in ten minutes . Yeah . Whoa . Linus : What ? She ... She saved every little thing from her life with Stinger . ( scoffs ) She ... she said she hated him , but clearly , she didn 't . Oh my God ! I know . I mean ... God , if she still cares about him , then , what would she be willing to do to get him back ? No . No , no , no . Come here . Look . You gotta look at this . Come here . - Look at this . - ( beeping ) Oh my God . Ivy ran the anomaly on us . She 's the one who trapped me in my memory . She 's the one who almost killed me .

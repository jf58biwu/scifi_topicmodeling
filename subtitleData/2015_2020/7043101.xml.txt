 Previously on Stitchers ... Why do you like me ? Are you deliberately trying to sabotage this ? I really think you are worth taking a shot on . I don 't want to be anyone 's shot . sometimes you can be a little bit of a bully . sometimes you can be a little bit of a stupid . she started ghosting me . Stay close to Linus . Make him trust you . Help us find out where Jacqueline is . Do you know how hard it is for Kirsten to keep seeing her mother like that ? does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger " cooped up " ? the monitors ... everything . Stinger must have found her . okay ? It wasn 't Stinger . - How could you betray me ? - I didn 't mean to . I just ... Can be please talk ? Where you going ? To be with someone that I trust . are you awake ? - Unfortunately . - Are you alone ? Also unfortunately . I 'm really sorry about yesterday . I shouldn 't have jumped on you like that . I was having a ... real bad day . Thanks . Sorry I called you a bully . That particular shoe fit . - Cameron screwed me . - It 's about time . I mean he betrayed me ... with Maggie . Now that 's impressive . She 's completely out of his league . I ... He told her something that I 'd shared with him in confidence . My mother 's location . hold on . What ? You know where your mother is and didn 't try to tell me about it ? To protect you . Anyone who knows where to find her is a target . I guess . and she had her moved ... so now I 've lost her again . I 'd say the first thing you need to do is break your foot off in Cameron 's ass . I did that already . It wasn 't pretty . get her to tell you where she moved your mother . you need to break your foot off in Cameron 's ass . I thought that was the first . girl . - Mmm . Where 's Amanda ? Maggie moved Kirsten 's mother ? It 's not like I knew what she was going to do with that information . She ordered me to tell her . I had to . she 'd shoot you . However ... and that 's big . I 've tried . - do nice things . Just be ... - Nice ? I don 't know . She 's acting strange . but I don 't know what . and men are from Mars . - We 're back to not knocking ? - Where 's my mother ? the better . - I think that 's up to me to decide . It 's not . Our mission stays the same . we keep mapping the brain until we have what we need to get to the other side . I get to decide how my story ends . wait . Not for you . just give her time . You did the right thing . the Aero Velocity Research Institute . He was found shot in the Mars simulation chamber . AVR ? That place is a fortress of awesome . What does that even mean ? It means they 're doing some really ground-breaking stuff there . They want to put people on Mars by 2025 . and there is a concern - that Jake Rowland 's murder . - was an attempt to get classified information . but the ones in and around the Mars simulator so we don 't have much to go on . Not until Kirsten stitches in and tells us what Jake saw ... because we know how awesome she is at doing that . Cameron . Seriously ? this was fun . - What 's everyone 's problem ? - Millennials . Hey . You okay ? - Girl problems . - Me too . we 're twins . We 're all going through stuff . but clearly not . Sorry . hear back from Ivy yet ? talk . clarity 's good . Maybe she 'll explain herself ... finally . Buzz ? Is that an astronaut reference or a Toy Story reference ? Let 's just ... do this . Induce stitch neurosync on my mark . one ... blast off . You really screwed me on this . Come on . You can fix this . I don 't know how . Just tell me what you did . You know I can 't do that . Jake 's arguing with someone . Sounds like he deliberately messed up something they were working on . Any ID on the guy ? I 'm being pulled somewhere else . People are cheering . Some kind of ... sports event or a game I think . I can 't tell . noisy . There 's a sign hanging on the wall with a bee auto parts " written underneath . " auto parts . " Checking . To think I used to love you . where you going ? He 's having some problems with a girl named Zelda . She 's on the move again . Looks like Jake got into a fight . He 's got a black eye . Maybe you 're just projecting your feelings about me onto Jake . Impossible . He only has one black eye . uber-nerd zero . and he 's at a desk somewhere . He gets to play games at work ? No wonder it 's taking us so long to get to Mars . Jake was shot while leaving work . The shooter just drove off . He 's dying . Trying to get to a desk ? Police report said a bullet hit Jake 's cell phone . Maybe he was trying to get to another phone ? Was he trying to get to a phone ? but he 's writing something in the sand . Can she see who it is ? The name of the killer ? What 's he writing ? Death moment in three seconds . Make the bounce . Did you see what Jake wrote in the sand ? - No . - Camille . but you 're not gonna like this . Blood and sand do not mix . see what you can find out . Take Cameron with you . Fisher 's an outer space buff . Fish ? - I don 't even like Mars bars . Perfect . I 'll go get changed . I guess I 'll go get the car . - You don 't like Mars bars ? - Nah . Maggie . I know Kirsten . It won 't . She 's at an emotional simmer right now . she could boil over . You have to tell her where her mother is . No . maybe I wasn 't being clear . - Maybe I 'm not being clear . I will never knowingly put any of you in danger . We good ? I know I owe you an explanation . I 'm really not as flaky as I 'm sure you think I am . If you tell me that you think we 're not good together I would get that . even a simple " sorry . that would do . but at least I 'd know . I pretty much had planned to say just that . But now that I 'm with you ... I can 't do it . Linus ... you are so awesome . I really do see us happening . how can I tr ... That 's a good start . how long is you and Cameron not talking going to be a thing ? Detective Fishy . Agent Clark . You must be the agents from the NSA . NSA . LAPD . We 're very sorry to hear about Jake Rowland . but his death brought with it a very unanticipated consequence . More unanticipated than his murder ? he took our Mars communication satellite off-line . - That sounds bad . - Worse than you can imagine . it will come crashing down to Earth . Is the government aware of this ? but their solution is for us to trigger a self-destruct before the satellite hits its zero barrier in 48 hours . That 's how much time we have to figure this out . maybe we can help . - NSA ? How 's that gonna happen ? - We 're more than just a pretty face . Sure . Was Jake unhappy here ? Why do you think he would sabotage the satellite ? sabotage was what he was paid to do . I 'm sorry ? Jake was our Mars project gremlin . His job was to creatively and deliberately screw with our simulator so that the rest of our team could know how to deal with the unexpected . I 've heard of this . Some companies hire both a gremlin and a fixer . Right . He would come in after hours and work up tests and challenges for our fixer to solve . great . and both of them would work up a solution . - Who 's your fixer ? - An engineer named Kenny Lee . He and Jake had quite the rivalry going . Things sometimes got pretty intense between them . you still can 't figure out why he would mess with an actual satellite ? but how he did it is the problem at hand . Whatever Jake did to the satellite was brilliant . software ... we 're at a loss . Kenny Lee . We 're very sorry to hear about your colleague . Thanks . What was your relationship like with Jake ? - Professional . - You two never argued about work ? we never argued . We were a team . I really gotta get AVR-SAT2 back online . are you making any progress ? - Not at this moment . hobbies ? We believe he was involved in some type of competitive gaming ? all right . - What kind of games did he play ? or what the hell he did to our satellite . - but we 're just trying to do our jobs . - You and me both . - he 'd crawl back in here to die ? - No . You said the NSA might be able to help ? We have on our staff the most brilliant communication engineer in the entire NSA . He has all the right security clearances . He 'd be happy to help . I don 't need help . I need to not be distracted . Send him by . We 'll take a look at him and see if he brings anything to the party . Any leads at AVR ? Buzzkill . Jake took a satellite off-line before he died . AVR has less than 48 hours to fix it before they 're forced to have to self-destruct . Have they looked at varying trace lengths based on impedance to insure there was no sync issues ? That is exactly why they 're expecting you . - You told them about me ? - Any other leads ? Not unless any of you know something about competitive video gaming . What are we looking at ? That is Kiyoshi Otatsume presenting me with the 2010 single-player strategy category in the World Series of Online Gaming . Ugh . Do you do anything cool ? See ? where is that ? - The Staples Center . - That is a massive crowd . - Eight thousand people . No one is getting killed over this . though . I found your lightning bolt and bee logo . Belongs to an abandoned automotive warehouse . I 'll follow up on the gaming angle to be sure . since I know the world and all ? mind if I go with you to AVR ? you can drive . This is very cool ! Kenny Lee . Agent Camille Engelson . They 're from the NSA . They 're here to give us a hand . What do either of you know about satellites ? I know they 're less complicated than what we work with all day . Really ? So what do you think about the quantum tunneling effect at smaller process nodes ? we 've moved to 3D geometries such as tri-gate transistors . Fourteen nanometers reduces leakage power . - Obviously . - 480 VDC through a 500 ohm resistor - should equal how much voltage ? - None . not volts ... which I always am . How about you ? I don 't speak pissing contest . Work with them . close the door . What I 'm about to show you stays between us . - Where 'd you get these ? - I hired a PI off the books to follow Ivy for a few days . I wanted to see what we could see while also keeping it off the NSA radar . clearly we have a problem . Or an opportunity . Damn it . Every time I think I 've got the problem figured out . You 're using the wrong file extension . You 're gonna teach me how to run system diagnostics now ? because you 're not running anything . you 're barely crawling . You 're welcome . what was that all about ? - I just needed some air . - Is that it ? - How 'd your talk with Ivy go ? - We 're back on track . She 's coming here later . She wants to bring me dinner . can 't win ' em all . - I thought you were past that with Ivy . You two seemed to get along . Not as well as you and Amanda in the kitchen . - What did you say to her ? - I may have simply put her on notice about using you to get information back to Stinger Senior . Why would you do that ? Linus . so just stay out of mine ! I 'm sorry . I know things between you and Amanda are ... - What ? - We need her . Who ? Amanda . I want to take you ♪ yeah ! Come on ! Do it ! Do it ! just see me ? ♪ Look at this . we 're home . This game is a top-down battle arena . I 'm great at these . from the stitch . I also saw that guy . Come on ! Whoo ! I 'm gonna go poke around . Whoa . I 'm in the wrong business . Hey . Found some interesting stuff on the backroom computer . this place is generating winning most of his matches against Zelda . I 'm wondering if the competition between Jake and Zelda got a little heated and she killed him ? okay . Got it . so the entire gaming system is completely off the grid . preserve the integrity of the game . see what else is on these files . see what I can learn . okay . You do that . come on . - You can 't stay mad at me forever . - Challenge accepted . Another win for Zelda ! Yeah ! Yeah ! ♪ See I saw you sitting there on a sidewalk ♪ - Hi . You 're new here ? - Huh . Yeah . - First time ? - Mm-hmm . I can tell . You 've got that look . - I 'm Zelda . - Apparently . noob ? - Cameron . - So what 's the game ? - War Zone . - Huh . Never heard of it . - You wouldn 't . - It 's not available to the public . - Really ? - but he or she is a genius . - Hmm . That 's Rick . He 's kind of a promoting machine . He put together this whole underground digital fight club . What ? Do people bet on the matches ? Yeah . Money makes everything more intense . A guy got his nose broken yesterday . It was awesome . All right ! It 's open competition time ! Five hundred dollars to whoever can last two minutes against DK ! One thousand dollars whoever wins their level ! you with the hair . you . Come on up . noob . DK . Line it up . up there . Let 's get it on ! Come on ! Whoo ! bro ? - Cameron . - Cameron ! - Yeah . - What the ... ? noob . - No way . You cheated ! I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . - You kicked ass out there . - Oh . Thanks . Does it always get this physical ? People take War Zone very seriously . I heard someone talking about some guy who died the other day . Jake ... Jake something . Did you know him ? yeah . I didn 't like him very much . uh ... we were good in the ring together . - You guys played each other ? - Yeah . A lot . um ... would you be interested in coming back ? I think you 're a natural . You had this place going nuts tonight . game on . - Great . All right . and I 'll see you soon . Cool . find out what you can about him . Zelda . - Hey . - Hey . Just checking in if now 's a good time . just let me know and I 'll meet you outside . Security 's nuts . - Sounds good . Can 't wait . - Me too . your father once paid someone to kill me ? we wouldn 't be sitting here . at least I wouldn 't . - Ms. Brown . - You want to tell me why I 'm here ? How long have you been in contact with your father ? I 'm not . We know as well as you do that you 've been seeing Daniel Stinger . Wherever you 're getting your information from is ... incorrect . that 's not really our thing . He came to me . Wanted me to help him . I told him no . End of story . That sounds a lot like a story with only a beginning and a middle . Not sure I trust the ending . that all depends on you . huh ? Ace . She 's with me . Amanda . It 's good to see ya . Is it ? this is what we 're working with . that is definitely some bloody sand . I see it . What do you need ? Space . Mars is all yours . Ah ! Nice of you to show up . Camille and Linus are on their way from AVR . The refractory period is over . What the hell happened ? Underground video gaming . It is unbelievable . It 's literally unlike anything I 've ever experienced . It 's better than sex ... Excuse me . about last night ... hobby . Getting hit in the face ? Did Zelda do that to you ? not every girl I know wants to punch me in the face . Just you . did you find something out at least ? but I 'm going back there tonight to see what I can find . I 'm sure you can use your face to beat the information out of someone . hey . aren 't you a little concerned about me ? Of course . - Please be careful . - Mmm . You 're no good to me dead . Close enough . K. Jake and Zelda are having an argument . I am not feeling the love here . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Yeah . I 'm not seeing any oxytocin spikes with them . Quel dommage . you 're cheating . No one is that good . - You don 't understand . - Zelda just accused Jake of cheating . We 're in AVR . Jake 's got a copy of the game up . he was cheating . so how does Jake have it on his computer ? Got another memory hotspot coming up . K. Moving you to another level . Jake . - Thanks . Jake just won a boatload of money ... - Here . - But he 's ... really being quite awkward about it . because he was cheating ? He 's putting up a satellite dish of some kind . I 'm not sure . Rooftop somewhere ? Eighteen seconds . You 're lying . I 'm tired of you being so secretive . okay ? I can 't explain it to you right now . Jake and Kenny are arguing . that 's it ? You 're just leaving ? it will all make sense soon . - or Mark is gonna fire me . - He 's not gonna fire you ! I 'm not gonna let that happen . You can do this . Stop overthinking everything . okay ? - Time 's up ! - Make the bounce ! and they weren 't just coworkers or friends . why hide it ? AVR has a strict dating policy . They would 've been fired . Did Jake tell Kenny how he gremlined the rover ? so I doubt he would 've told him how he gremlined the satellite . then who did ? I 've got Amanda working on that as we speak . Good timing . I was just about to run the simulation . reversed the shifting sand and digitally recreated whatever Mr. Rowland 's final message was . shall we ? What is that ? Looks like a pattern of some kind ? me too . - Zelda . - Zelda didn 't kill Jake . And you know this because you know her so well ? It 's just ... it 's just not the vibe I got . Vibe ? We solve our cases by vibe now ? I 'm definitely getting a vibe here . see what else I can find out . wait . Stretch . it 's ... It 's turning me into someone I 'm not . I don 't like being this mad at you either . I just ... I don 't ... I don 't know how to stop . Not yet . Just ... okay ? I 'll try . good . The amateurs who are here to help fix nothing are leaving . but we 're all here to help . hmm ? Electronics ? Astrophysics ? Satellite communications ? Engineering ? - What 's your super power ? - Death . Death is my super power . Seems like you got this . I 'm gonna head out . can I call you later ? I don 't think that 's a good idea . but ... as far as you and I go ... we 're just on totally different planets . Is this because of what I said ? I gotta go . Take care of yourself . Yeah . - What ? Let 's get back to work . - What 's the point ? We 're gonna have to initiate self-destruct so this freak show is over anyway . Wait . didn 't he ? Someplace with a couch ? - How did you know that ? - Show us . He would work down here sometimes when he didn 't want Mark to pester him . Nobody knew about it . - Except you . - Except me . does it ? we always lose the things we love . it doesn 't matter . Because it 's worth it . How did you know Jake 's password ? there 's nothing on here about Rick . There it is . There 's the game . War Zone . Shove . Let me see something . Huh . there are 41 iterations of the game . - What does that mean ? - It means Jake created it . - Shove . Let me see something . - All right . Someone has been working overtime . Jake made a recent addition but ... it 's encrypted . and then made money off winning that game in a competitive underground gaming circuit ? The computers at the warehouse weren 't connected to the Internet . How could Jake have altered the game in the warehouse from here ? I know how . I know why we couldn 't figure out how Jake gremlined the satellite . - It 's because he didn 't . - Then why is it off-line ? It 's not . It 's just not pointed towards Mars . where 's it aimed then ? - There . - That 's the warehouse . Jake put a satellite dish on the roof next door . Which would explain how he was able to download the game from here to the closed system at the warehouse . not AVR . - Let 's re-aim that satellite . - How long do we have ? Two hours before self-destruct . Jake focused it there for a reason . We owe it to him to find out why . - You ready to take me on ? - Absolutely . - I 'll see you out there . - All right . what 's up ? - He 's NSA . What did you do ? I 'm sure it 's nothing . Sneak that back to him . Hey . all right ? noob ... game on . Cameron . did you come to cheer me on or discourage me ? Inspire you . You have to win this match . but it 's only accessible for the next 45 minutes until we have to reposition the satellite . nothing you just said makes any sense to me . and it will . all right . The match we 've all been waiting for . The noob versus our very own Zelda ! He knows you 're NSA . Get out while you can . Not until I win this match . - Noob . - It 's your funeral . Zelda . Ready ? And begin . ♪ Ain 't gonna take it slowly ♪ I think I know that . How much time do we have before Kenny and Camille reposition the satellite ? - A couple minutes . - Okay . - Zelda . - You 're going down this round . - Jake needs your help . - Don 't you mean you need my help ? Jake . He 's waiting for us at the end of this game . and I think it has to lead to his killer . Why should I believe you ? Because you want to see how this ends as badly as I do . War Zone was designed so that one player can 't let another player win . the computer 's gonna take over my game play . Then we have to beat the computer ... final round . you ready ? And begin . noob . what the hell are you guys doing ? Play him right now ! Zelda ! He 's not winning . everybody . What ? What is that ? That looks like a pattern of some sort . It 's a pattern from AVR . It 's a passcode . What is this ? Come on ! What is this ? then I 'm already gone . and I created the game War Zone . he threatened everything that I cared about ... this is some kind of a joke . And turned War Zone and me no . This is ... - I don 't know what 's going on ! - He forced me to play Rick ... - All right ! My secret 's out now . So is yours . stay back ! Everybody get back ! Game over ! DK . Mm-hmm . Rick DeToro ? You 're under arrest for the murder of Jake Rowland . - Yeah . - Jake would 've liked you . I guess your vibe about Zelda was right . Guess so . I ... I 'm really sorry I betrayed your trust . - I know . - I don 't want to lose you ... but I don 't know how to fix this . Fix us . Me neither . - Ivy ? - I need a friend . Me too .

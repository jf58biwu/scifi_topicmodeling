 Previously on " Hunters " ... Hunter number seven , aka Lionel McCarthy . What do you know about us ? He took Abby . My wife . We traced the heroin found in McCarthy 's warehouse to a Columbian drug cartel . The Hunters are running drugs in the jungle and you 're sending me a new guy to find them . I 've raided dozens of drug labs . I 've never seen anything like this . Something else is going on . When do we tell them we 're fighting monsters and not a drug cartel ? We don 't tell them anything , and they 're not monsters . - Did you always look so ... - Human ? Thought I was , until my parents told me I wasn 't . This is what we are . What was that ? He saw too much . Has E.T.U. ever caught one that doesn 't look like you ? We 've never captured one alive in any form . McCarthy must have warned the Hunters about the Columbian operation . If he did , then he 's culpable for all these victims . Not to mention the bombing fatalities , or the junkie he killed just to toy with Flynn . Jules , where are we with the Spotify lead ? Nothing yet . My team 's combing through tracks as fast as we can . I caught a break . Possible McCarthy lead , female . Good , work it . And follow up McCarthy 's musician persona , Cymatics Society . I 'll loop in the other agents . Regan is prepping for a debriefing . Flynn has family matters to attend to . His wife ? Unfortunately , there 's no sign of her . Yet another reason we need to find this target . We may not know his current whereabouts , but we know this , Lionel McCarthy is out there and he is on the hunt . Next on up to the mic we have Lionel of the Cymatics Society . ♪ Gimme danger , little stranger ♪ ♪ And I 'll give you a piece ♪ ♪ Gimme danger , little stranger ♪ ♪ And I feel your disease ♪ ♪ There 's nothing in my dreams ♪ ♪ Just some ugly memories ♪ ♪ Kiss me like the ocean breeze ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Now if you will be my lover ♪ ♪ I will shiver in shame ♪ ♪ But if you can be my master ♪ ♪ I will do anything ♪ Yeah ! We 're dying . Fiery forge , jealousy , terror , secrecy . Oh , yes , secrecy ... A furnace seal 'd . What 's he talking about ? The human form . Blake . Divine ? Hmm , not so much . But a hungry gorge , yes . Oh , very , very hungry . Mmm ... Ah ha ha . Where do you want it ? Surprise me . What 's that for ? It 's for you . _ Flynn ! - Hey . - You 're seven minutes late . Six-and-a-half , but who 's counting ? Oh , yeah ... you are . We 'll , uh , just get some lunch and I 'll have her back before 2 : 00 . Back by 5 : 00 ? - Back by 5 : 00 . - Thank you . That 's it ? I haven 't seen you in a week and you 're checking Facebook ? It 's " International Piano Magazine . " Abby bought me a subscription for my birthday last year . Okay , what are you reading about ? About who won the Cliburn competition . Like you really care . I care about you . You 're the one who didn 't even call for five days . Emme , it was work , I had to go ... Look , don 't they know Abby 's missing ? Isn 't that more important than some stupid job ? I thought you were reading a piano magazine . I am . Mm-hmm . It 's cold and it 's raining and I want to go back to school . What ? Come on , we just got here . I don 't understand why you pretend to care about me . Of course I care about you . Then do as I ask and take me back to school . After the Colombian contractor was contained , you and Agent Carroll continued in pursuit alone , despite being ordered otherwise . The Hunter was wounded , and Agent Carroll and I agreed that it would be best if he and I ... Keep your statements to your own judgments and actions . This was our chance to catch a native Hunter . I was our only chance . You 'd rather I just let it go ? What happened when you came face to face with the Hunter ? He looked at me for a few seconds and then ran off . I chased it ... but dropped my weapon , and it outran me . I 'm having a hard time understanding why the Hunter left you completely unharmed , especially after it killed 27 people at the heroin plantation . It must have known what I was . Which still begs the question . I had to pull some strings , but I went back further in Abby 's phone records , like you asked me to . Nothing unusual in the records the last six months . If you go back further ... Kevin 's phone number keeps popping up . A lot . He was my partner . She 'd call him when she couldn 't get me . Check out the day he was killed . Abby spoke to Kevin three times that morning , an hour before he got shot , then nothing . No way . Hey , I 'm just showing you what I found . They were not having an affair , and Abby had nothing to do with my partner 's murder . Kevin was killed by a drug cartel . Maybe . I thought one of the Columbian groups might 've had a hand in it ... Envigado , Olvidos , Los Rastrados ... but it was a dead end . Olvidos . - What about it ? - A dead junkie turned up about a week ago with Olvidos heroin in her system . And a hole in her back ? There 's been a string of those murders , gory , like some homemade spinal tap voodoo shit . What 's all that got to do with Abby ? Bitch thinks I 'm the mole . Since when have you cared about what Finnerman thinks of you ? - I don 't . - Good . Neither do I. _ That thing still on ? There 's something I didn 't include in my report . When the Hunter saw me , it communicated something , in its clicking language . - What did it say ? - It wasn 't words . It was a shape and spaces , like what I heard when I listened to the Slavic track . It looked something like this . You saw this when it spoke to you ? More like I heard it . It 's hard to explain . Hmm . We keep this to ourselves for now . I wanted to run something by you , unofficially , before taking it to Jackson . There 's been a string of murders ... junkies . Look at the marks on the bodies . - They 're just like Columbia . - Yeah . And the junkie we found in McCarthy 's warehouse . You think he killed them all ? The first one was found here , ten miles from McCarthy 's farmhouse . The next two bodies were found near the music stores he took out . One in D.C. and one near Baltimore . So he 's not just a mad bomber ? He 's a serial killer , too . The heroin ring , Columbia , these bodies , it 's all connected , and McCarthy 's the missing link . And the only lead on Abby . Not bad for a fed . So why this shithole ? Contacted a few old FBI informants . One of these working girls recognized a picture of McCarthy and thinks he might be renting a room here . - Shh . - What ? He 's here . Let her go . On your knees , asshole ! You 're lost , girl . I can help you . I 'd say you 're the one need help right now . Hmm ? Yeah . Hey . I want my wife . Hey , attention people ! Thanks to the outstanding work of Agents Carroll and Regan , we now have two live Hunters in our custody . This is our chance to ask the big questions . Who are they ? Where do they come from ? What do they want ? World peace and friendship bracelets , I 'm guessing . Lionel McCarthy is no foot soldier . He is leadership ... he 's behind the bombings , Columbian drug operation , and now several murders here . He is a direct link to the Hunter leader known as Brother Number Four . And he knows what happened to my wife . Abby is a part of the puzzle , but this is bigger than any personal imperative . I will interrogate McCarthy . Briggs , Regan , I want you with the female in case she regains consciousness . Carroll , you 're cataloging McCarthy 's belongings from the hotel . Everybody else , Kubark protocols are in effect . Our interview room 's soundproofed for Hunters , and everything that happens in that room is recorded at all times . Let 's be smart . Let 's be careful . Let 's do our best . I caught that asshole , I should be in there . Yeah , that 's not gonna happen . McCarthy 's the most important live asset this unit has ever acquired . Fine . Not lead , but help . And you will , by doing your job . Counting McCarthy 's underwear ? That 's waste of my time . McCarthy knows me , he specifically asked to see me . I can get under his skin . I know I can . Maybe this is why I 'm here . Follow my lead , do you understand me ? Yes , sir . With a little reverse engineering , we 've managed to turn their weapons against them . This one will drop a rhino . I give you the signal , don 't hesitate . If I can 't give you the signal , don 't hesitate . Don 't make me use it on you . Yes , sir . Truss Jackson . Hello , Flynn . I thought you 'd be fatter . Sorry to disappoint you . You 're human , that 's all you can do . I can 't lie and say I haven 't been looking forward to meeting you . We have a lot to discuss . Shall we begin ? Thane , Weldon , Hyrum , Elize , Cambria , and sweet little Lucia . Your children have beautiful names . And of course , I couldn 't forget our precious little orphan . The poor waif ... like something out of Dickens . Losing her papa and her surrogate mother so ... unexpectedly . That 's a ... good start . Tell us more ... Lionel . Well , this is our chance to get to know each other better , after that awkward first date in the warehouse . So much we didn 't get to chat about . Talk . I 'm all ears . So am I , Agent . So ... am ... I. I can hear your heartbeat quicken . I hear the blood rushing through your veins , your muscles tighten . Your teeth are grinding . I hear your fear , boy . Diastolic blood pressure , 120 over 44 , heart rate 29 , respiration , seven breaths per minute . Is that normal for a Hunter ? Not compared to me . And I 've never seen a Hunter vomit tissue like that before . Sedation will stop that , but her condition is deteriorating . Or in withdrawal . She has track marks . Alien junkies , it 's like we captured a Corman movie . Lab analysis on McCarthy 's instrument , the oversized syringe , small traces of heroin , but mostly human blood with a high concentration of endogenous opioid nerve peptides . It 's a byproduct of heroin use . Hunters can 't get high on heroin . So they 're shooting up junkie brain blood . - That 's revolting . - Well , it obviously works . To take the edge off of being in a human body . You wouldn 't believe the shit I 've tried . When I was younger . Subject has a growth in the upper back and neck region . There is no reason for us to be enemies . We 're here to try and understand what it is you want from us . From Earth . Well , it 's simple , really . We are eat . We are kill . If you won 't talk , we 'd like to try and arrange a meeting with Brother Number Four . We 'd like to show we can be an honest partner , peaceful . There 's no need for violence . We 've had plenty of opportunities to observe your E.T.U. Your government , humankind itself , we have every reason not to trust you creatures . Yeah . We 're not perfect . We make mistakes , but we learn from them . Indeed . I 'm sure dissecting my kind has been very educational . I wonder what cutting open your wife would teach my people . If you continue to hurt humans , to kill my people , measures will be taken . We must protect ours , just as you would protect yours . We want to know where you came from , why you 're here , what you want . Maybe we can help . What is it about you humans ? You think if you understand everything , you 'll sleep better at night . Does anybody really need a reason to swat a fly or ... kill a wife ? We spent four days together , Abby and I. Her neck smelled like lavender and soap . So tender . Shattered like glass . Gutless . Good-bye . So much for you getting under his skin . He 's toying with us . What should we have done ? Beaten him ? That 's exactly what he wants . What we need here is patience . We don 't have time . He had my wife , damn it , you heard him ! For all we know , that could be a lie , and Abby is a human collaborator , or she could be one of them . You know something I don 't ? No . Which is exactly why we need to proceed with caution . Okay , put me back in there and I 'll get the truth out of him . You had your shot . You 're sitting this one out . Flynn Carroll . Emme ? What ? What do you mean she 's not in school ? You got one of those ? Oh , yeah . Right above my tramp stamp . Is it a tumor ? I have no idea . Regan ! ETU 's suddenly a breeding facility . I didn 't see that one coming . No one did . And the mother 's condition ? Not good . We 're doing everything we can - to ensure it survives . - You better . What have you gotten from McCarthy ? Nothing yet . Hours in captivity and you have nothing . Truss , this is a critical window . If you can 't do it ... There 's something else . Agent Carroll 's adopted daughter Emme has gone missing . And this concerns me how ? McCarthy previously threatened her life . Whose life hasn 't he threatened ? I need a bulletin , not a missing person . It 's a suspected kidnapping . Thanks , Reyes . Why do you think the Hunters took your daughter ? They took my wife . Well , your wife 's a Hunter , and she took your daughter . I want back in there . Alone . That 's out of the question . It 's not your call , Commander . In you go , Agent Carroll . Use that broken heart . Thank you , ma 'am . Love swings the hammer ... so it can swing for us , also . Congratulations , Dad . You feeling all warm and fuzzy ? How is the baby ? Does it have my eyes ? You 'll never know . I 'll just have to comfort myself with Abby and delicious little Emme , then , won 't I ? Tell me where they are ... or I 'll tear your face off . Oh , please ... take it off . I can 't wait . Where the hell are they ? ! Is this really how you 're gonna question the most valuable prisoner you 've ever had , with this dumb , blunt instrument ? - Uhh ! - Ohh ! No ! Not the money maker . Do I have to spell it out for you ? You can 't torture a Hunter . Especially not me . In truth , you can 't get much out of torturing a human , either , but that doesn 't keep you fools from trying . But we know so little about your kind . We got so much to learn . Like your ears . You know ... What makes them so sensitive ? Careful ... You break it , you buy it . Oh , yeah , I 'll be careful . - There . - Guh ! Come again ? I can 't hear you . Yeah ? Uhh ! Agh ! Get in there . Carroll ... Carroll ! That 's enough ! Well , that was effective . Hunters aren 't invulnerable . We just haven 't found their weakness yet . Jules , any thoughts ? We could rig up one of the sonic weapons . Decrease the intensity . It 's too risky . We guess wrong and we kill the best source of intel we 've ever had . What about that treatment we devised for Regan ? She reported discomfort at the higher amplitudes , right ? The treatment was intended to help Regan 's urges , not harm her . It 's a tool . I don 't care what it was intended for if it does the job . Bring it in . Will it look like a human when it grows up ? It 's hard to say . Human embryos look like other mammals at various stages of development . Or it could be some sort of hybrid . The mother 's in no condition to answer any questions . Hey . You all right ? Not really . Is that how you came out ? I don 't know . My parents didn 't have baby pictures . I can 't believe it came from McCarthy . He 's a fu ... monster . Briggs knows the controls ? No , he doesn 't . I 'll do it . Toys . Lovely . I prefer using honey to vinegar . But I 'll make an exception in your case . Can you play Angry Birds on it ? I love seeing pig heads explode . This is your last chance . Please . That quiver in your hand . The ... hesitation . Hmm , dipping your little toes into the murky waters of moral compromise . Is it cold , Truss ? Is that what makes you shiver ? Come on . You can do it . Give it the old Mormon try . Whew ... that feels good . Enjoying yourself yet ? Who 's the mole inside the E.T.U ? They have the blood of 27 innocent people on their hands ... as do you . Who is it ? Would you believe me if I told you ? Why don 't you tell them who the mole is , Agent Briggs ? Didjeridoo , or didn 't you leak that intel ? He 's lying . Give him more . Briggs is the mole , Briggs is the mole ... Gah ! Sorry , I 'm confused . This machine really smarts . We all know Agent Regan is the mole . Birds of a feather ... you know ? She can 't deny her true nature , heh . Or is it ... Flynn Carroll who 's the traitor ? Do you even know what that Boy Scout was up to in Afghanistan ? Wait ! Elder Jackson , please . I give in . You 're a man to be reckoned with . You wouldn 't believe what this man has done . Nasty , nasty stuff . And all for what ? God ? Country ? Paycheck ? So I don 't slaughter your children ? Bible in one hand and bazooka in the other . And you call yourself a believer . Get him cleaned up . We 're through here . We just got started . We don 't even know what we 're doing to him . We 're hurting him , so his kind won 't hurt more of us . This is torture . There are no laws defining the torture of an alien species . I don 't need a law to distinguish right from wrong , ma 'am . Spare me your bullshit . That thing in there is killing American citizens , citizens that you swore to protect . Ruth ... you and I have done some very questionable things in the service of this country , but there is a line . You show me that line when those beasts invade your home , attack Willa , your children . Hunters have not only promised to shed blood , they 've made good on that promise , on domestic soil , no less . And if we don 't stop those things now , God only knows how far they 'll go . They are not the only ones to have shed blood . This nation didn 't ban torture because it 's cruel , we did it to protect ourselves ! And I will not allow my agents to be sullied by it . Emme , it 's me . I need to know you 're okay , so call me . I don 't care where you are or what 's happened , just ... get in touch with me as soon as you get this . Please . McCarthy has my entire family . Yeah . But don 't forget , we have his . And if he kills them before we break him ... that 's just , uh , collateral damage , right ? I don 't believe it 's gonna come to that . So you think we can break him ? McCarthy 's a lot stronger than I anticipated . His mental toughness is extraordinary . So Hunters are immune to torture ? Then we need to find another way . Something 's happening . What 's she saying ? She 's dying . I don 't know what else to do . The baby needs physical contact , but Finnerman won 't allow it . I saw it in his eyes . McCarthy cares for them . McCarthy 's not human . You don 't know what you saw . I 've seen enough . We 're giving this a try . The newborn and its mother aren 't doing well . We don 't know what to do . Let me hear them . I need to see them . I need to touch her and the baby . It 's how we help each other heal . Plea ... please . Let me help them . They 're no good to you dead . Then give me Emme and Abby first . Not possible ! You have your boss , I have mine . Your boss isn 't here , you are , and your woman and your baby are . You just told me they need you . That 's your choice . They live or they die . Strieber Self Storage . Unit 470 . She 's going to die . The baby , too . Yeah . We 're doing everything we can to help . How long are we going to hold out ? McCarthy 's our best shot at finding Flynn 's daughter alive , so until we know she 's safe , McCarthy doesn 't go in . Yeah . Flynn , how close are you ? - Almost there . - How soon ? Listen , McCarthy goes nowhere near the baby , not until I know they 're safe . Hurry . It 'll be okay . No ... no , no ! Take McCarthy in . We haven 't heard from Flynn . We need to know his wife and daughter are safe . No . That newborn must survive . What about Carroll 's daughter ? There is no time . We need to keep faith with Carroll . He means something to the Hunters . That is an assumption only . We 've yet to see anything that actually proves his worth . He may have brought us McCarthy . Exactly . But not because they hold him in any special esteem . I mean , it was a straightforward capture . Any soldier could have done it . It just so happened Carroll was in the right place at the right time . Ten more minutes , please ! We don 't have it . McCarthy goes in now . Please ... remove the gag . She 's dead . That 's on you , Jackson . The baby 'll die , too . We don 't have much time . I need to touch the baby . Thank you . I won 't let them have another one . - No ! - Down ! Get down , McCarthy ! Get down on the ground ! Don 't make me ask you again , Guano ! No ! Uhh ! The baby 's not breathing ! Help me ! Emme ! Abby ! Emme ! Abby ! Emme ! - Yeah ? - Carroll , it 's Reyes . We found Em . Is she all right ? Wh-where is she ? She 's safe , unharmed . Squad car picked her up a few miles from her school , dropped her back home . - Where was she ? - Didn 't say . We 'll keep an eye on her till you get there . Thanks . I 'll be there as soon as I can . Police found Agent Carroll 's daughter . She wasn 't at the storage facility . McCarthy played us . We underestimated him . I accept full responsibility . No . We both underestimated him . But it won 't happen again . I 'm removing him from your custody . What ? And placing him where ? In a more secure facility . Where ? There 's no one else who understands the Hunters like we do . It 's done . And they saw the heavens open . And they saw the angels descending out of Heaven as in the midst of fire . And they came down and encircled those little ones about with fire . And the angels did minister unto them . You 're praying . My faith , uh , teaches that the souls of little children who die are taken by God because they are ... too pure , too lovely ... to live on earth . Even Hunters ? Do you think I have a soul ? Yes , I do . Abby ... Abby ...

 Peter : Previously on Helix ... You 're being evacuated . Why ? Pathogen is spreading . Make me immortal and you will get your child back . You can try it on me first . ( grunting ) what 's happening ? I didn 't do anything ! You just said goodbye to your baby . We graft all our trees from the original rootstock . We call her mother . She 's gone . Found this in his stomach . That looks like tree sap . Whatever it is , he 's been practically living off it . At the very least , we need to get out and investigate , See if we can figure out its nature . If you leave this room , you are finished with my team . It was never your team , peter . You were just keeping alan 's chair warm . I 'm sorry , dr . Kyle . For what ? ( screaming ) What you got there ? It 's from the bleeding tree . The bleeding tree ? We eat it so we don 't get more sick . You 're clean . Not anymore . I ate all of it . They 're all gonna kill themselves . ( unsettling music ) Amy : I really wish you would come to me first . Anne is prone to delusions . We can 't believe a word she says . Really ? Because she told us that the only way to replicate your apples Is by grafting a special rootstock you call mother . Be honest with me . Why is mother so important to you ? Julia : How many dead ? Fifty ? A hundred ? It 's nothing . Ilaria believes overpopulation is unsustainable . In three days , they plan to act . I want to present michael 's infertility grafting As an alternative to global genocide . I can 't do that without mother . It 's quite a story . It 's the truth . How much do you want for mother ? I 'm not interested in money . I only want one thing , To see the world through silver eyes . Like michael and dr . Jordan ... And you . I noticed your contacts the moment you arrived . I can make you immortal . If you can deliver the root . Well ... I must first ease concerns among the fellowship . But ... We shall reconvene later . In my office ? If you 're lying , I 'll make sure the only world you see is pitch black . ( theme music playing ) We searched every inch . No red sap . We 'll do one last sweep of the perimeter , then move out . And the boy , soren ? Considering what he 's been through , he 's doing okay . Tell your men to keep him close . He 's the only one to have fully recovered from the fungus . His immunity might be the key To turning the red sap treatment into an actual cure . How 's dr . Sommer holding up ? Alan : I 'd say he has 48 hours . If that . Soon as i get a sat signal , we 'll call for evac . And the supplies i ordered ? Everything you need to take down the disease is in my ship . He 'll have a better chance at a real facility . He won 't have any chance if we don 't find that tree . Dr. Kyle ! Dr. Kyle ! No ! No ! Soren , soren ... Don 't do that . Come here . Look , dr . Kyle is not feeling very well right now . Is he all right ? We 're just being extra careful , all right ? I want you to stay away from him until we can get him some of that ... That red sap . But why not just bring him to the bleeding tree ? ( bell tolling ) Anne : I 'm so sorry , landry . I have failed you , just like the others . I should have done more to protect you . And what could you have possibly done ? I have to get back to my duties . And ... What are those , exactly ? Mother is missing , amy . I 'm going to make sure she doesn 't fall into the wrong hands . What the hell have we walked into ? An outbreak with no cure , A cult with no leader , not to mention an episode Of family feud , sister wives edition . I offer amy carte blanche , what does she want ? Immortality . She 's not stupid . Worse , she 's smart and certifiable . You 're not actually going to make her immortal ? Oh no , it 's impossible . I 've tried replicating the science . Every time , my simulation 's failed . Last thing the world needs is a forever amy . We get what we came for , regardless . Follow her , see if there 's anything you can leverage , any kind of weakness . I 'm gonna do some digging of my own . Julia . Be careful . You , too . Peter : I 've looked everywhere ! Mother 's not here ! You 're angry . I can understand that . Can you , anne ? Because i 've been searching all night , And all i 've got to show for it is bags under my eyes . ( thumps table ) What if mother is lost ? Or destroyed ? Then i 'd say our deal is void . Julia . Could you please give us a minute , anne ? You 're done , peter . No reward , nothing . We 're not finished searching yet . Do you even have a plan ? Or are you going to comb the entire abbey one room at a time ? I will find mother . You have my word . The word of a traitor ? Ha ! I 'm a traitor ? You 're a member of the ilaria board ! Once a hypocrite ... You sold me out to the highest bidder . Betrayed me to that monster Who slit my mother 's throat . Now i 'm on the inside , trying to change their tactics . How could i have been so wrong ? I threw away my marriage for you . Deny all you want . I loved you , julia . And i thought you were a good man until i realized there 's nothing inside . You 're hollow , peter . Anne : Words have meaning , dr . Walker . They carry weight . Amy told me you were delusional , Not to trust anything you say . Amy will say anything to get what she wants . Let me guess . She told you she has mother . My daughter is a liar . Oh . Only three people Were charged with mother 's care . Michael , myself ... Who 's the third ? My son . Landry . Amy : Where 's mother , landry ? I know you 've hidden her . You need to tell me where she is . Show me a sign . Anything . I can feel you staring at me . Like when we were kids , remember ? Trying to get a peek up my dress ? This is no time for games . I need your help . Tell me . Where 's mother , landry ? Just blink once if you understand . Wake up ! Wake up ! You need to wake up ! You useless piece of shit ! Ugh . Disgusting . I hope you 've had time to reflect on your careless actions . I did everything that you asked me to . You promised to ... You failed ! Look at him ! He can 't even talk ! And i need to talk to him . I can 't treat him unless i can diagnose what 's wrong , And i can 't do that unless i have an eeg or a ctcn ... You 're boring me . Just fix him . It doesn 't work like that ! Then i see no reason for keeping you or your child alive . You need us . We 're your only link to immortality . Not anymore . I happened to find a new immortal much more interesting . What new immortal ? Perhaps you know her . Julia walker . Just fix him ! Ah ! Ah ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Landry ! Amy , amy ! Landry was always willing to go beyond what was required . Let me go . He was responsible for michael 's protection His person as well as his research . Landry , no ! He knew mother was essential . I 'm sure he has her in a safe place . ( grunting ) Landry . What are you doing ? Landry ! Hello , sarah . ♪ i rode my bicycle past your window ♪ last night ♪ i roller-skated to your door at daylight ( screaming ) landry ! ♪ it almost seems that you 're avoiding me ( screaming ) ♪ i 'm okay alone ♪ but you 've got something i need ♪ well , i 've got a brand new pair of roller skates ♪ you got a brand new key ♪ i think that we should get together ♪ and try them out ya see ♪ i 've been lookin ' around a while , you got somethin ' for me ♪ oh , i 've got a brand new pair of roller skates ♪ you got a brand new key Where ... Is ... Mother ! ♪ i ride my bike , i roller skate , don 't drive no car ♪ don 't go too fast ♪ but i go pretty far ♪ for somebody who don 't drive ♪ i 've been all around the world ♪ some people say i 've done all right for a girl ♪ well ♪ i 've got a brand new pair of roller skates ♪ you got a brand new key ♪ i think that we should get together ♪ and try them out ya see ♪ ( yells ) Bad practice , sneaking up on people . You followed me first . Those who give must also be willing to take . And those who make promises must also be able to deliver . Understand ? ( panting ) Make me understand . I only take orders from dr . Walker . Shame to waste so much aggression On someone who can 't even feel it . Do not talk about her that way . You really care about her . Have you cared about all of them each in their different way ? You know who i don 't care about ? You . Unless you 've got the mother root . The abbey is an extension of my being . All i need to do is look deep enough and i 'll find her . You lied to us . Do you want me to find mother or not ? Be a good boy . Let me go look . Wherever you go , i go . Like a shadow . ( sighs ) For a moment , i thought you were him . The way the light would catch his hair . But ... Then i remembered . Michael is gone . Maybe he has the right idea . Whatever prevents michael from being here , I assure you it 's not to be envied . Anything would be better than this . I came here to lead an investigation , and now i 'm ... Persona non-grata on my own team . Change is inevitable . What i don 't understand is why you allow dr . Walker To speak to you that way . We all say things we don 't mean . We always say what we mean at the time we say it . Do you think she has a right to judge you ? I broke up her marriage to my brother . Or was the affair merely a result of his failings ? No . I drove them apart . I don 't deserve their forgiveness . You don 't need their forgiveness . You 're a brilliant doctor , a great man . You have no idea what kind of man i am . Hell , i 'm not even sure myself sometimes . I see you , peter . I see what your path could be . If only you could see it for yourself . You don 't know how the outside world works . Perhaps not . But i know human nature . Those who are meant to lead Are never satisfied to follow . ( sighs deeply ) So what 's so important about this root ? You 're missing the point . Mother is a means to an end . It 's not so much what mother is ... As why . So tell me . The truth can be unforgiving . Are you certain ? Don 't play games with me , anne . It 's not a game . It 's very dangerous . For both of us . Julia : I 've only got 72 hours Until ilaria releases the new narvik c . What could ilaria possibly have to gain ? They 're not looking to profit in the short term . It 's about restoring balance for the future . The board believes that ... The board ! Julia , do you hear yourself ? I 'm doing everything in my power to change this , sarah . Have you even considered the implications of worldwide sterilization ? Infertility is a way to temporarily depopulate , Just until resources are replenished . You think you know better , But you don 't have the right to make that choice . No one does . We 're going to be on this planet for centuries . We have a responsibility to do something . You sound just like one of them . One of us . I 'm not one of anything . ( sighing ) When narvik is released , There will be no stopping it this time . Within a few weeks , the cdc as you know it won 't exist . Bodies will pile up in every major city . You will lose everyone , sarah . Friends , family ... You 've seen narvik up close . I know you care about stopping this outbreak more than anything . Actually , there 's something i care about more . Is dr . Kyle gonna be okay ? I hope so , soren . Are we getting closer to the red sap tree ? I think so . I only went a few times . Just get us there , okay ? I 'll take care of dr . Kyle . All right . What 's that smell ? You smell that , sommer ? I don 't smell anything . Stinks real bad . Like you ! What did you say ? ( singsong ) ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! I don 't stink . ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! Shut up . ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! Just shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! No ! Shut up ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Stop it ! Julia : I 'm so sorry , sarah . Are you ok ? I can 't start thinking about what happened to me . It won 't do him any good . Now do you see ? I have to get him back . He 'll be frozen like that . Forever . I 'm his mother , julia . I 'll find a way for him to grow . I hope you do . What about the father ? Does he know about all of this ? Yeah , alan knows . Alan ? Yeah . Where is he now ? He 's out there , looking for the cure . Hmm . Same old alan . Yeah . Oh ... What ? Julia : Look , right there . Oh , my god , it 's leaking ! Where ... Where 's the crack ? I don 't see it . It 's hard to tell . This equipment is ancient . Oh , my god , he 's gonna die . Not if we can figure out a way to give amy what she wants . With what ? Look where we are . The lab is outdated , but we 'll make do with what we have . It 's impossible . And who better than the two of us to figure it out ? Us ? Look , we 're both desperate and we 're running out of time . You want your baby and i want mother . Either we can fail alone , Or we can both get what we want by working together . ( door opens ) All right , ladies and gentlemen , five more minutes . Use them well . Winger : We got one hour of daylight left . So we move in the search to higher ground . That 'll give us a chance to pick up a sat signal . Soren : Dr. Kyle , are you hungry ? The flavor 's oatmeal . Come on , eat some . It 's good . Eat it ! Come on , stinky sommer , eat it ! Don 't call me that . ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! Smell that ? Smells like shit . Kids : ( sing song ) ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! ♪ eats his way out bit by bit ! ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! ♪ eats his way out bit by bit ! ♪ stinky sommer rolls in shit ! No , don 't ! No , don 't ! Alan : Kyle , kyle , kyle ! Kyle . ( gagging ) Kyle , what you 're seeing isn 't real . All right ? Can you hear me ? ( grunts ) Quick , grab him . Take it easy , doc . Stay right here . We need to get to that high ground . Peter : Where are you taking me , anne ? Anne : Just a little farther ... ( grunting ) Peter : Oh ! Jesus ! Do you need a moment ? No . The boneyard out in the woods . All those skulls without teeth . The vessel must be prepared to receive the offering . Vessel ? Are you talking about human beings ? All will become clear , peter . But in order to hear the truth , You first must speak your own truth . Peter : Anne ? Anne ? Found something . Take a guess . I 'm not playing games . Come on ... Aren 't you even a little curious ? ( sighs ) Ow ! Ah ! You 're hurting me . ( laughing ) You try that again and i will slice your pretty little throat . Okay . On to the next . ( sighs ) We got signal ! We got com ! ( static noise ) Manitou . Manitou , this is humphries . Manitou , switch and answer , three one . Over . Manitou , this is humphries . Switch and answer , three one . Over . Mayday ... Manitou . We are overrun . Repeat , mayday , we 're overrun . Manitou , this is winger . I need a sitrep . I need a sitrep . Everyone 's sick . Can 't hold ... ( garbled ) They 're gonna kill us all ! No ! ( gunshots ) ( gunshots ) ( screaming ) Manitou , this is winger . Manitou , do you copy ? Man : We all sound the same underwater . We all sound the same underwater . We all sound the same ... How the hell is this disease spreading so fast ? Any number of ways . My cutter ... Has it gone airborne ? Screw this ! We gotta get back to the ship . Stow it , lieutenant . We were given orders to evac the cdc , Not follow some one-eyed kid to a magic tree ! That kid might be the key to saving all our lives ! And there is no ship . Not anymore . They 're all dead . Dr. Farragut is right . We need to regroup and find that tree . ( men whispering ) Hey ! Hey , soren ! You still got that power bar ? Yeah . Mmm ! That 's delicious . Now i 'm thirsty . Can you bring me my bag ? I 'd better ask commander winger first . Oh , she 's real busy . Too busy for us . Come on , it 's just a drink of water . Hey , maybe you 're getting better , like i did . You 're starting to sound like the old dr . Kyle . Do i ? Yeah . So if the old dr . Kyle Asked for just one of his hands free So he could drink his own water ? Um ... Okay . Yeah . There you go . ( grunting ) Ah ! Help ! Please , help me ! Get him ! Go , go , go ! ( classical music playing ) We know the immortality gene is the same in all of us , So why did the csf transfer work from me to you And not you to landry ? I thought my spinal fluid was different from yours , But they 're identical . What if it wasn 't the difference in the cells Themselves , but the timing of the transfer ? There 's this study that came out of berkeley Linking embryonic cells to breakthrough cell regeneration . Right , how stem cells specialize over time To create various tissues in the body . When i got your spinal fluid , You had only been an immortal for a few days . Your cells had yet to specify the rna chain . And once immortal dna is transcribed in rna ... Those mature cells are no longer transferrable . Yes . That 's why your csf couldn 't be transferred . You weren 't a brand new immortal . If we could figure out a way to somehow reverse the specificity ... We could give amy immortality . ( chuckling ) You know , you really are being wasted at the cdc . You should be running your own lab . Unlimited funding , cutting edge equipment ... Gloves off . Ilaria ? Why not ? There 's not enough funding in the world . Anne ? What the hell is this ? Anne : I 'm going to ask you a question , peter . It 's important that you answer honestly . No more lies . Do we have to do this in the dark ? There can be no distractions . Now tell me ... What do you want ? I want you to turn on the light , anne . What ... Do you ... Want ? Ah ! Look , you 're gonna have to give me a little more than that . One word . The one thing you want above all else . I want to be happy . I want to be fulfilled . I don 't know , anne , i want a goddamn golden toilet . You 're lying . If you 're not ready to face your truth ... No , no . ( sighs ) no , i 'm ready . Okay . I want Respect . I want you to think , peter . When was the time you felt the most respected ? I don 't know . When i was made team leader at the cdc . You 're lying again . That 's someone else 's work . What is your truth ? I don 't know ! I 'm not lying . I 'm not lying to you . Worse . You 're lying to yourself . Think . When did you feel the most respected ? I told you , when i ... Remember a time when you had what you wanted , When you felt complete , When you weren 't hiding or lying , when you were yourself . I can 't . You can . Stop hiding . Accept your truth . When i was sick . With narvik . They all came to me . I didn 't have to say a word And they all listened to me . ( door creaking ) Where are we going ? One of landry 's old hiding spots . We used to play here when we were children . That 's hard to imagine . What ? That we were allowed to play up here ? No . That you were ever a little kid . ( grunting ) ( grunting ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( sighing ) What 's taking balleseros so long ? Don 't worry . He may get sidetracked , But he always comes through . It 's not like we have anything to give to amy anyway . We 're running out of time and she 's gonna kill my son . Let me talk to her . Alone . No . No . You 're too emotionally invested . You said you wanted to do this together So i 'm coming with you . ( door opening ) Amy will see you now . And who are you ? That 's the bitch that stabbed me . Stand down . Stand down ! Copy that . Stand down ! Secure your weapons ! Winger : Dr. Sommer , let the boy go . Why do you hate me ? Why ? I don 't hate you ! Please ! Let me try to talk to him . Too risky . If you and your guys go in there , we 'll lose them both . I won 't let you hurt me . I won 't let you hurt anyone ! Please , don 't ! Anne : At some point , You must decide what kind of man you want to be . One who fears , Or one who inspires fear . ( baby crying ) Which man are you , peter ? Are you ready to lead ? ( woman laughing mockingly ) Now i can finally share my truth with you . ( hissing ) ( baby crying ) What is this ? Some kind of ... Experiment ? ( woman panting ) I was an experiment . As were amy and agnes And all those who came before us . I was one in a long line of failures . It was michael 's dream to breed an immortal companion . What you see are those who refused his call . ( screaming ) They were brought here , stripped of all non-essentials ... ( panting ) Like teeth . Unnecessary . We didn 't want them to chew through their feeding tubes . They became pure vessels . ( screeching ) And once they bore michael a child , He would end their path . Mother ... Michael ... The fellowship ... It 's not about propagating family . It 's about control . Respect . True leaders will make you believe That their ideas are your own . That their way ... Is the only way . Alan : It may not feel like it , But you always have choices . When we were young , We believed everything everybody told us , Even those who hurt us . But someone hurt them , too . And it 's not true That you have to hurt others first to survive . There is another way . There is no other way ! Why can 't i make them like me ? Why ? They 're afraid That you 'll discover the truth . That no matter what they 've done , You still decide what happens next . Don 't make the mistake i did . Don 't hold on to the past , Become the thing you hate . Show them they have no power . All right ? Walk away . How do i know they won 't follow me ? You don 't . ( soren sobbing ) There it is ! The tree ! Anne : Only you can decide your path . Leader ... Or follower . ( baby crying ) Leaders don 't have to say a word And everyone listens . Will you lead , peter ? Will you choose who lives ? ( baby crying ) ( baby crying ) ( gagging ) I 'm not seeing any Happy smiling faces . I kept up my end of the bargain . And we have a plan to keep up ours . A promising new theory . I don 't care about your theories . You know what i want . These things don 't happen overnight . We need more time or you 'll never get what you want . Sarah . And yet it worked for the two of you . I 'm not stupid . Evidence to the contrary . Then i guess you won 't be needing this anymore . Wait ! What are you doing ? Stop it ! Say goodbye to your son ! Wait ! You don 't want to do that . And why not ? Because that baby is the key to giving you immortality . What ? Julia : The child 's dna has been frozen in time . Genes normally pass genetic traits onto offspring , But in this case , we can engineer the reverse . Julia , what are you talking about ? How does it work ? Another spinal thing ? No . We 'll have to implant the baby into your uterus . No ! No , no , no ! You can 't ! No ! Julia , you liar ! No , you can 't ! It 's my baby ! I 'm going to be a mother ? Sarah : No ! No ! What are you doing ? No ! No , you can 't ! No ! No ! Helix.S02E10.720p.WEBRiP.2CH.HEVC.x265-T4M English HI SRT Subtitles - UF ( v2.10 )

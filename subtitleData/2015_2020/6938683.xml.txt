Cineblog said that it 's crazy intense . Some guy at the first test screening went totally insane . They had to roll him out in a wheelchair .  so some geriatric shits himself , PR jumps all over it , they hype it up . See , this is what they do , Chloe . They get the cast of some cancelled CW show , they put a fresh coat of CGI on it , get a fast food tie  in  . What  what are you  what is that ? What are you doing , what are the little hieroglyphics ? They 're called emojis , your majesty . I know that , I just  . God forbid people actually communicate using real words .

They take 3D and they flatten in out into regular 2D . And you just happen to have these on you at all times ? Well , Chloe , I always feared for the day that you took me to a 3D movie .

All my life I was told I had to choose . But , you know , from the moment I was born , the day they named me the Chosen One , I never felt like I had a choice ... until now . Even if it is my destiny , I choose to follow it . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , Chloe 's friend , there 's no texting . Can I help you ? Can you  you know , I don 't know , maybe . Your friend , her phone is distracting the other people in the theater .  Shh !  lt 's on vibrate ! It shouldn 't be on anything . All right , didn 't you see the little cartoon at the beginning ? There 's no texting . What are you , like a cop ? What  what are you , like her lawyer ? God . Sprechen sie English ? God , Chloe , can you believe this ? Shh ! Um , maybe just put it on silent ' til the movie 's over ? Thank you . I am Coltantha , the Chosen One . Let me see . Don 't be shy .

How quickly you stole my sword from me ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you scared me , Coltantha . You still do . Hey , could I borrow your glasses really quick ?  What , no !  Just for a second , come on . Dude , get your own . No , I ... threw mine away . Well , that was stupid . Well  I just  . Sometimes you can be so thick .

No , I just wanna check something , okay ? We can talk about the format when the movie 's over ! No , it 's not that , it 's not that   Shh , my God !  Excuse me ? So you can talk all you want but we can 't text ? I have a legitimate question about the film . The film , it 's the big video that 's showing behind your little phone screens . Please don 't ruin this for me , okay ? Fine ! Coltantha . The hell ? Okay , okay . When are you gonna realize that you are home , that you do belong ... with us ? It 's not that simple . Yes , it is . Holy balls !  Jesus Christ !  Dusty , calm down , what 's wrong ? God , there 's something loose in this theater ! Yeah , a big dumb loud guy .  Shut up .  No , no , not me . There 's  there 's something coming off of the screen ! It 's just the 3D , idiot . Yeah , I know , idiot . Chloe , keep your feet up , it could be anywhere .

Chloe , come with me . Chloe , it 's not safe . Chloe ! I 'll be right back , okay ? A monster reaching out of the screen and attacking people ? I know it sounds crazy , okay ? That 's not crazy , that 's Cinethrax . It 's the next dimension in cinema . It 's  no , it 's not part of the film , okay ? There was an actual thing coming out of the screen . It  it was this close to my face . Yeah , man , that 's Cinethrax . You know , it 's so believable you think you 're there . Can I talk to an adult ? I am an adult . That 's adorable . Can I talk to a manager ? I am the manager . You 're the m  what are you , 12 ? What are we in , Narnia ?  Dusty !  Dustin , at this cinema , we believe that the customer 's always right . However , I do have to point out that no one else in there had a problem with the projection . Okay , so I 'm  so I 'm making this up ? I 'm crazy , is that what you 're saying ? No , but ... Look , maybe it was just your weird glasses messing with the 3D . Wait , hold on a second . You were wearing unauthorized third  party eyewear ? They 're  they 're called shifters . And these shifters , you were wearing them when the tentacle monster appeared ? Yes . And what happened when you took the shifters off ? The  . It disappeared but  the   Right .  Okay , whatever . I 'm just telling you what I saw , all right ? Or what I thought I saw . You know what , we will just get a refund and we will be on our way , all right ? Um , actually , I 'd like to stay and finish the movie . Well , okay , you know what ? That 's too bad because the train is leaving , all right ?  Come on , Chloe .  No . Okay , I 'm sorry , did I embarrass you in front of your little friends ? Yes . Yes , you did . You 've been embarrassing me all night and the worst part is you don 't even care . That  like hell I don 't . Well , this cute monster stunt is one hell of a way of showing it . Chloe . Look , you  you say you want me to stay weird , but you just want me to be like you . Well , I don 't want to be like you , not if you 're going to act like this . I want my own friends my own age . I want to fit in , okay , I want to and ... if you have such a problem with that then you can just ... you can just go to hell .  Chloe   I 'll find a ride home . Wait , Chloe , Chloe . No , Chloe , wait .  Chloe   Sorry , sir . We can 't let you back in there . What are you  are you serious , this is bullshit ! Look , man , do you really wanna cause a bigger scene right now ? I  I don 't  I   Shit !  Hey , tell you what , we 've got a place where you can hang , wait the movie out , and if you seem chill , then maybe I can get you back in . Cool ? Fi  fine , let 's go , let 's go . Come on in . Excuse me .  What 's going on ?  lt 's fine . I 'll take care of it . Have a look . Chloe 's right down there , safe and sound . So you 're cool Uncle Dusty ? Chloe talks about you all the time .   Yeah , you 've seen , like , every movie ever , right ?  I 've seen a few .  Yeah , that 's what Chlo said . Have you seen " L 'arrivÃ ( Copyright ) e d 'un Train en Gare de La Ciotat " ? What ? " Train Pulling Into a Station " ? LumiÃ ¨ re Brothers , 1895 , it 's , like , the first short film . I  yes , I 've seen that one . You know , when they showed it at Le Grand CafÃ ( Copyright ) , the audience actually thought a train was gonna come out of the screen . They ran screaming from their seats . Does that sound familiar ? Good thing they didn 't play that on Cinethrax , right ? Aw , look , I 'm sorry . No offense , all right , but ... I gotta say , from one film buff to another , your apprehension surprises me . Cinethrax is just like color or sound or cinema itself . You know , but , you know , change , it can be scary but there 's no stopping progress , so why resist ? It 's like watching " Star Wars " for the first time . It 's really that good ? Try it , don 't try it , it 's all the same to me . But let me put it to you this way : Do you wanna keep being cool Uncle Dusty or do you want to be the guy who ran away from the train ? You know what ? Fuck you . Should we do it now ? Your wickedness and foolishness tempt me to hate you . I 'm afraid , Chosen . This is worse than the  . My God . Chloe , Chloe . Come on , check in here . Fuck . Shit . Here they come . Look out , get down ! Quick , take this ... to the citadel . Hi , this is Chloe . I literally never check these messages . Text me or something , okay ? Uncle Dusty . Are you in there , little Uncle Dusty ? I missed you , you know ? I thought that you had left forever . I couldn 't leave you . But you did , you left me ! I did that one time but I couldn 't do it again . So much has changed , W , I 've changed ! I 'm not that little girl that you hung out with at the citadel . Shit , stupid  . Uncle Dusty , are you in there ? Somethings never change , Chosen . Don 't call me that ! See what I mean ? Fuck ! Come on , buddy , open up ! Giving in isn 't the same as giving up . Uncle Dusty !  Join us , Chlo .  Totally , do it . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience .  Join us , Chlo .  Join us , Chlo . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience .

Let us go , you assholes . Hey . Shh . Relax . Everything 's gonna be all right . You know , in a way , we envy the both of you ... seein ' it again ... for the first time . To feel its touch inside us . To sense ourselves connecting to something ...  Wonderful .  ... wonderful . Zach , please don 't hurt him . Hurt him ? Is that what you think this is ? Dude , you got it all wrong . Do you think it came all this way just to hurt us ? It came to unite us . It came to make us one . Do you know how unhappy I was before Cinethrax came ? I was angry . I was confused . I was just like you . I was alone . Well ... I 'm not alone anymore . And you don 't have to be either . No ! Come on , Dusty . Your body is host to trillions of organisms . What 's one more ? No , no ! Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience . Embrace the experience .  Are you ... ?  No .  Are you ?  No .  Okay .  Okay . You guys still don 't get it . The world is about to change and if you don 't adapt you 'll die ! No , Chloe , Chloe ! No , no ! Don 't look , Chloe , no ! Hey , asshole . Embrace this . Come on , Chloe . Come on , Chloe , let 's go . Chloe , let 's go . Go ? There 's nowhere to go . They were right , it doesn 't hurt . No , go , Chlo  Chloe , no . Chloe , snap out of it , snap out of it , okay ?  We 're almost free .  We are free . All of us , our world has changed . You don 't have to be afraid anymore . No , no , okay , you 're still in there , I know you 're still in there . Of course I 'm still in here . We all are . No , listen , we can  I 'll get you outta here , I 'll get you outta here , okay , everything 's gonna be okay ! Everything already is . God . God . Please don 't go . You know how lonely it is out there . Stay with me and you 'll never be alone again . Stay and watch the movie . What , just bend over for some galactic hive mind ? I can 't lose you , Chloe . Is  is  is ... now ?

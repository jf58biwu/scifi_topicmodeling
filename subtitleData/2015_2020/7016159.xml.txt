 Mummy , wake up . Just a little more . Mum ! No , monkey . You 're gonna have to let go . Sarah . You need to listen to her . Kira ! Rachel . Jesus . No ! Hey , not again ! Hey ! I know you can hear me . You bitch ! Come in here ! Rage , Sarah . Rage ! Let it all out . Where 's Kira ? I 'll kill you for this ! Siobhan already tried . Don 't worry . I was restrained from above . Rachel 's donned the velvet glove for you and yours . She wants to parlay . You wanna put her in here with me ? Cage match ? I can 't wait . Hello , Sarah . As you can see , I 'm at home , perfectly safe and sound . Alison , what the hell 's going on ? Well , Helena and Donnie are lost in the barrens . But Rachel 's very nice Neos have brought me home , and I 'm back to my busy schedule . Art is here too . I 'm sorry , Sarah . There 's no more wiggle room . You can call it a truce or whatever , but they 're going to want you all to come on in . What about Cosima ? Yo , Sarah . Apparently , they 're keen on me staying here . Are you all right ? No , I 'm at Dyad . Cos , what about you ? What about your cure ? Rachel administered it to me herself . My trial 's underway . Are you serious ? If it proves efficacious on me , then I 'm to expand treatment to all the LEDA sisters . Holy shit . I think those were my exact words too . How ... How are you ... Hey ! Hey ! Sounds like she 's got work to do . Cosima 's on the mend , Alison in her craft room . Sarah . Wouldn 't you like to go home ? Rachel 's offering everything that 's been taken from you . So , is Sarah Manning finally ready to behave ? The Board is assembling for you at 1 : 00 p.m. , Ma 'am . Thank you , Mr Frontenac . And , Sarah is on her way up . So , you 've gone full Neo now ? I 'm not buying it . Why not ? I saw you kill a Neo with a baseball bat . Well , that was personal . This is something else entirely . She 's ready . Sarah ? Where 's my daughter ? She 's here . Milk or lemon ? Kira , now . As soon as we speak . You 've been asleep for some time . Siobhan and I registered Kira back at school . As soon as we 're done here , you can go back to your old home . Together . Felix is waiting . Lemon on the side ? Cut the shit ! What are you after ? Your cooperation with Kira . We 'd like to study her , here at ... It will barely affect your life . Shove it up your bleached arse . Regularly scheduled visits , and low impact , non-invasive study . Study of what ? Of her unique physiology . She 's special . We both know that . She 's a little girl . Why ? What are you looking for ? Anything we find will of course be proprietary , but she isn 't . She 's yours . We want a change . An end to this war . Who , you and that 170-year-old man ? Yes . Mr Westmorland put me in charge . Everything is different now . He 's real . And , God willing , Cosima 's cure works , it 's in all our best interests . Mum ? Hey , baby . S. You all right ? We 're good , Sarah . Looking forward to being back in our own house . It 's okay , Mum . We 're fine now . You 're not going along with this , are you ? I am . It 's all down to you now , Sarah . Please , Mum ? Hey , Alison , it 's Mum . The kids are doing well here , but , you know , they 'd love to hear from you . I told you , Donnie hasn 't called . I don 't even know where he is . Alison , it 's important that we find him . My hunch is he 's with your preggo sister . Alison , Reverend Mike here . We missed you at the Fall Fair planning session so , Nona Walker is taking over as coordinator . What ? No more messages . See , no Donnie , no Helena . And if you 'll excuse me , I have to stop an insurrection at the church Fall Fair . You 're not going anywhere . Art , I have a thousand things to do . We 're sorry . Until they get back , you 're gonna have to stay here . So I 'm just supposed to sit here like a bump on a log ? Well , you 're crafty , aren 't you ? Come on , look at this shit . Start your Christmas cards , knit a sweater . The easier you make this for us , the easier you make it on my new partner here . Just ride it out , Alison . But they better turn up soon . Hello , you 're back . My babies . Helena , the ... The operation was good . They removed the impaled object and you 're gonna be fine . Where is Sister Alison ? I don 't know . I wish I could call and see , but since she was taken by Neos ... No , don 't call . I know . You just need to relax and consider your " bebes . " But my tummy 's hurt . Well , there was a small issue with one of them ... We 're awake . Good . What is ... What is wrong with my baby ? It 's gonna be fine . But the stick did puncture the amniotic sac and sternum of one of the twins . So , we 're gonna do another ultrasound . The neonatal specialist is on her way ... " Neo " ? That 's not what you 're thinking . What are you thinking ? Nothing . Nobodies . Okay then , why don 't we pull down these sheets and have a look ? No , no , no . It 's okay . She 's a nurse . Do you want me to do it ? I 'll do it . I 'll do it . Thanks . That ... What is that ? I think this is seaweed . They say that these are vitamins . Everyone here takes them . Hey , hold on . I don 't think we will , okay ? But maybe that 's what makes P.T. Westmorland live for so long . Isn 't your treatment working ? It 's not that fast . You know the drill . It 's a trial , right ? Well , I think you 're gonna get better . Do you know that girl ? That 's Aisha . She 's sick , but P.T. ' s gonna cure her as well . He 's so full of promises up there , isn 't he ? Do you think I can meet her ? Uncle Felix ! Hey there . Hey . Hi . Hi . You wanna go get your school stuff there , babe ? Okay . You 're actually here . I 'm good . Aw , touching . Why don 't you choke on your own vomit ? Piss off . I will , and I am . Just as long as when the final bell tolls at school today , Rachel picks up Kira and takes her for her first Dyad visit . The principal is aware that Aunty Rachel shares a loose custody due to ... Well ... You . We clear ? We 're clear . So what the hell are we gonna ... They might be listening . There 's been eyes on the house all morning . It 's like we 're in a bloody panopticon . God , are you kidding me ? So what do we do ? What , we 're not gonna give Kira to them ! We know . But my people are being watched , too . We haven 't quite figured out an escape plan yet . I 'm on it . What are you gonna do ? Out the basement window , across Baisley 's yard , just avoid the end of the street . I know , I know . Who do you think invented sneaking out of this house ? I did ! You did , actually . This time , you 're gonna go out the front door with your daughter by the hand . Come on , let 's go . Okay . Off to school then ? Uncle Felix says the trick on the first day of school is to find the biggest kid in the yard and hit him in the nose . What ? What do you think ? No . Good , because I don 't want you stressing over anything today ? Your only job is to have fun . I know . And don 't worry about me after school with Aunty Rachel . Hey , hey , no , no , no . We don 't ... You don 't call her " aunty " . But it 's different now . Hey , welcome back , Kira . I 'm Mr Mitchell , Kira 's homeroom teacher . Sarah , her mum . Sorry to hear about your car accident . It was a bitch . Come on . Bye , Mum . Bye . Do you have any Bunsen burners ? Bunsen burners ? Maybe . Come on , let 's go . Listen , we need you back on the island . We need you back with Susan . But if you 're gonna help us , Ira , it means you go against Rachel . Rachel stabbed my Susan . What can I do ? For now , you can wait upstairs . Scott and I are gonna be up in a couple of minutes . Yes . Hey , your mum 's gonna be okay . Thank you . Clone phones , version 5.0 . End-to-end encryption . Hopefully . Me , S , Helena , Alison , Sarah , we 've got extras here , though . We found MK . Oh , my God . You 're joking . Where did you find her ? She contacted one of our Sarah Manning avatars . We verified it . It 's her . Where is she really , though ? Like , geographically . Her last message was , like , 20 minutes ago . That 's my loft . Mrs Hendrix , I 'm Dr Slaight . What do you want ? I spoke with your surgeon , he said he 'd discuss a C-section with you . Depending on your baby 's chest injury , I might still recommend that . No . They 're too young . Let 's have another look , shall we ? It 's okay . It was that one , there . Are you sure ? I saw the previous images . I don 't see it . What is problem ? Look , I 'm gonna order a CAT scan , but don 't be alarmed . Can I get a CAT scan for Mrs Hendrix ? Come on , Doc . You 're freaking us out . What 's going on here ? It 's good news . The wound is no longer visible . " No longer visible " , what does that mean ? Frankly , I 'm not sure . It 's remarkable . So , Charlotte told me that you met Mr Westmorland ? He came and looked at me . When was that ? After the French doctor . She says Delphine was very nice . Did ... Did he tell you what kind of cancer you have ? A Wilams ' tumour . Wilms ' tumour , right ? You must be very tough . Cosima ? What are you doing ? We 're doing school . What does it look like ? Come with me . He wants to see you . I don 't know what it all means either , but ... Whoever the man behind the curtain is , he 's put Rachel in charge , which means he 's on my hit list . Are you sure we 're safe ? No , but I have swept twice . There 's no one listening . There must be records . I mean ... If you live that long , just need to get digging . What 's up ? Hi . What 's wrong ? Sorry ... I found MK . She broke into my loft . " MK " ? Hello , Sarah . Would you lose the slasher mask , please ? Go on , it 's all right . She 's your family . She needs to know . I 've been sick for a long time now , Sarah . Oh , my God . Why didn 't you tell us ? Cosima 's working on a treatment right now . She 's , she 's testing it on herself . I know . Felix told me . But , listen , we 've been watching Dyad . And they 're recruiting naive surrogates . Rachel wants to restart human cloning . Not to interrupt , but I don 't think you 're safe there . Rachel 's people are watching the house and the school , not here . S , don 't worry , all right ? They think I 'm with you . Look , with your network down , MK thinks that she might be able to get Sarah and Kira away . Really ? How ? I 've been hiding a long time , Sarah . If you can get Kira out from under their surveillance , then I can move you today . Okay . Hey , MK , you 're with us now . All right ? And there 's nobody who can help you more than our sister Cosima . P.T. doesn 't meet with just anyone . He told me you were special . You talk to him a lot ? Of course . I live here . Who are you , Mud ? Don 't be nervous . I 'll be waiting right out here . Hello ? That tortoise belonged to Darwin himself . She lived here to the ripe old age of 263 . A record , like mine . That 's really you in the picture ? Please , sit . Through Neolution science and my own genetics , I have lived a very long life . Now , perhaps , we can work the same magic on you . Now , your results from last night were ... Well , remarkable . It appears that you 've developed a very elegant immuno stealthing factor . Are these the transgene expression levels ? Indeed . Congratulations . It appears effective . Now , how would you feel about continuing on with your work after you 've developed a cure for yourself and your sisters ? Well , where do you see my work going ? Well , we follow the science . No disrespect , but I know you created me . And I have no interest in being part of your collection . So , what the hell is the point of all of this ? Conan Doyle penned a poem on that very subject . You know , we delighted in theological satire back then . Cheeky Arthur , he imagined a debate between microscopic cheese mites , trying to determine the origins of their chunk of cheese . Whether it came down from above or rose from the platter below . " They argued it long And they argued it strong And I hear they are arguing it now But of all the choice spirits that lived in the cheese Not one of them thought of a cow . " You 'll have full access to the lab . Go , save Charlotte . Save your sisters . And perhaps , one day , you 'll cast your keen eyes in the direction of the cow . When does it start to hurt ? The goal isn 't arousal . It 's transcendence . I 've been more aroused at high tea . Hit me . I need you to understand , Mr Westmorland has made me feel whole . My whole life , I 've searched for my purpose . You mean point-manning the genetic future of the human race ? Yes . It 's why I exist . Don 't tell me you slept with him . I 'm not going to hit you , Ferdinand . I don 't need to any more . Fine . Then , we 'll work . I take it that your G-men have secured the scene , everything is kosher ? Yes . Kira is at school . Siobhan and her brood are back at the house . You can call the car , they have it all in hand . Well , I don 't know what kind of help you surround yourself with any more , but ... By all means , let 's go collect Kira . You can be part of this change or you can be part of the past . Helena , calm down , she is a neonatal doctor , not a Neo . My babies are special like Kira . They want our biologies . You 're saying the baby healed in , like , hours ? Yes . Like Sarah , I make miracle babies . The doctor wants to cut it from my belly . Argh ! I have to go . Jesus , Helena , where ? I will tell you , but on pain of your doozy heart . Only Sarah can know where I hide . Seriously ? Okay , before your CAT scan , are you familiar with an amniocentesis ? Needle . Is that medically necessary ? I 'll explain everything to your wife , Mr Hendrix . Our staff would like to talk to you about her accident . Standard stuff , just a few questions . Sir , this way , please . Okay . You 'll be all right ? Alison ? Felix , make sure they get a good look at you . Absolutely . Hello , bastards . So we 're going into MK 's underground . What does that look like ? Well , we meet a driver who takes us to another driver , and then another ... She knows what she 's doing . MK says that when you do this the door closes behind you forever . Sarah , you know that you and Kira can never come back . What time is it ? Bell rings in two hours . There must be at least a dozen men between here and the school . But thanks to our misspent youth , I can get in and out via the basement , no problem . When we do this , they are going to come down on you hard . So , you have to make sure that Mika is safe and stable . She 's going to drive us off to the lab . Okay ? And Scott will take care of her good . Sarah , look at this . Something you will enjoy . It 's from MK . Shit , she 's hacked into Dyad security cameras . Okay , you cow . Let 's go kidnap my daughter . Is this what it 's like to be a parent ? How banal . Well , you seem to have this in hand . I 'm going to watch from the other side of the building . Here , so ... The trick to multiplying by nine is the first digit is always one less and then the second digit adds nine . Okay , so you teach the class . I 'm going to kick back in the teachers ' lounge with Call of Duty . Kira ? Well , she 's busting you out early , Kiki . See you tomorrow . I hope so . Thank you . Good . Mum , where are we going ? We 're making a break for it . But , until we 're free , do call me " Aunty Rachel " . Come on , faster . Mum , are you sure this is a good idea ? Yes , I 'm not letting Rachel take you , babe . Okay , that is it , everyone . Remember your book reports are due Tuesday . Who 's got choir class ? You two ? Let 's go , you 're late . Where is Kira Manning ? Did you lose her ? Shit . No running . Excuse me , there 's a man who 's following me , there . Do you see him ? Do you recognise that man ? Hi , can I help you ? I 'm picking up my wife and daughter , blonde , down the hall there . Right , could you come with me to the office , sir ? Shit . Hey ! Sir , I 'm going to have to report you . Hi , hey , this way . Are you clear ? I lost a Neo and I 'm out . You good ? Just get to the rendezvous . Sarah , we 've got a problem . MK didn 't go to the lab . She hasn 't moved from my place . She will be all right , Felix . No , she won 't . Sarah ! Shit ! I 've got time to get her there . Meet me at the pick-up . Right , so ... Just go . Go , go , go . We need to draw some amniotic fluid from your womb , so let 's give you a local . Okay ? Don 't worry , Mrs Hendrix , I 've done hundreds of these . Amnio is for genetic testing . To collect DNA . I have read the books . Then you also know that amnios check for infection . Which in your case , a tree branch puncture , is a real concern . Do you understand ? Yes , I understand puncture . Okay , good . Car keys . Is this going to take long ? Obstetrics , code white . Obstetrics , code white . Let 's go . What 's going on ? Don 't move . Obstetrics , code white . Obstetrics , code white . How could you let them slip out of the house ? Ferdinand , pick up . Where are you ? Why are you calling ? Is something wrong ? I 'm coming to get you , you are not giving up . MK ? No . No , no . All right ? This isn 't the plan . I 'll take you to Scott . No , you 're not . You 'll be safe with him . I 'm too tired , Sarah . You should not have come . We 're all tired , MK . But we can 't do this without each other . Wait , Sarah . What ? You were followed . You have five seconds to hide . Sarah ? Sarah ? MK , it 's Ferdinand . I know , I 'm watching you . You have to leave . I can 't , I can 't . Go back to Kira . No . I 'm here now . I 'm not leaving without you . Open up . Sarah . Lock the door , get your stuff . We need to go . I told you , I 'm too tired , Sarah . I 've been running my whole life . I know you have . So have I. But we run on principle . It 's all we 've got left . Shit . Shit ! He 's coming up . Get your stuff . No , I 'm not going . What ? Give me your clothes . I 'll pretend to be you . It 's the only way . No , no . There 's no time . I 'll buy you time . Time for Kira . Mika , you can 't do this . You can 't do this . It 's Westmorland . His story is the key to all of this . But it doesn 't add up . Where did he build his power ? What is he doing with it ? He 's hard to trace , hidden deep . I 've been trying to find him . New privacy networks , cryptocurrency marketplaces , there 's no data . There 's not enough data . We need more data . Mika , I just want to save my daughter . I know . But this is bigger than that . Sarah ! Car keys , go . End of the alley . Thank you for trying , Sarah . I wish it could 've been different for us . Me , too . Go , go ! Been expecting me , Sarah ? Sort of . I wanted you to find me . Funny , I have . You have no idea the volcano that outfit is inspiring in me , right now . Turn around . Slowly . Sit down . Let 's talk about this . I think it 's about time , Rachel , you started following my instructions , don 't you ? Veera Suominen . This is even better . She 's on her own . What 's going on ? What happened ? What happened to MK ? Nothing , babe . She 's going to be fine . She 's not fine . Come on , come on . You and I , we 're going to go in this van here . No , I want to go to school . I know . I know it 's hard , but we 're going to just ... We are going to keep you safe . I am safe . Kira , get in the car . No . Get in the car . You can 't talk to me ... Pardon me , Rachel . After all those years I invested in you . All that money , which is so fantastic because you stole it from me , didn 't you , Veera ? This is like two revenge fantasies in one . I even get to finish Helsinki . You can 't hurt me any more . Yes , I can . You hurt me , Rachel . You hurt me ! You hurt me . You 've hurt me ! You hurt me ! MK is ... Dead . Sarah ... Just let me , let me . She 's not dead . She 's dead , I know it ! You couldn 't know that . Please . You can 't know that . I don 't feel her any more ! Don 't say that . I want to know why I am like this . And I don 't want to go with you ! That 's enough ! I 'm going with Rachel ! No , that 's enough . Let me ... You want to go with Rachel ? You heard her . Leave . She wants to know why she 's like this . We can 't run from it any longer . Well , small mercies . Thank you . They 've given themselves up back at the house . I 'd like to think in some small heinous way , I had something to do with that . You disobeyed my orders . You made a mockery of me . Who are you now , exactly ? It was all for you , Rachel . Always . Simon . Would you make sure the body is taken care of and see Mr Chevalier out to the street ? Let 's go . Good luck on the island , Ira . Thank you , Felix . It 's time . Kira . I know it 's been a sad day , but we are going to take such good care of you . Jesus . I 'm not a ghost . I heard . You 're still the last person I expected on my doorstep . Are you alone ? Because I don 't have that much time and I don 't know who to trust . Neither do I. But Sarah can 't know that I 'm here . This has to stay between us . Safer if they don 't know that we are communicating . I 'm listening .

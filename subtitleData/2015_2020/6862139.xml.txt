 [ Shiro ] Okay , look . I now know for certain that Zarkon is tracking us through the Black Lion . We have to find some way to stop him . How are we gonna do that ? We 've never had this situation before . Two paladins battling for the same lion . Well , unless we want Zarkon taking control of Voltron every time we get close ... I 'll have to forge a new bond with my lion . One that 's stronger than his . Well , while you 're working on that ... the rest of us need to find some new teludav lenses ... otherwise we won 't be able to travel via wormhole . - Is that something we have to mail order ? - Does anyone even make those anymore ? [ Allura ] I don 't know . Only a few Alteans could use the teludav 10,000 ago . They may not exist anymore . I think I may know where we can get some . Coran ! You 're not suggesting going to one of those filthy swap moons ! The last time you went , those space pirates took you for everything you had . Space pirates ? The Unilu were traders and pirates ... that roamed the galaxies and dealt in black market goods . Umvy spice , by-tor water , little bottles of infinity vapor . Of course , you had to bargain . No one could bargain like the Unilu . Last time , I ended up giving away three quarters of my shipment of lango ... in exchange for a used pogo oscillator . [ chuckling ] Father was not pleased about that . Well , while Coran is picking up his lenses ... I 'll take you shopping for something sparkly . This isn 't shopping ! You 're not wandering around saying ... " What a lovely pink hat ! This is so becoming . " No ! I can 't allow Allura to get anywhere near those ... filthy , lowballing Unilu hoodlums . But I 'd love something sparkly . Look , you 're the only one who can operate the Castle . You need to be resting , after all you 've been through . Now , let 's ready a pod for our mission . We need to get in ... find the scaultrite lenses , and just get out . Shotgun ! What ? No , you have to be in the pod bay to call shotgun . Since when ? [ Hunk ] Since forever ? That 's shotgun etiquette ! I wrote the book . While they 're doing that , I 'm going to head down to the hangar . I need to strengthen my bond with the Black Lion . [ sighing ] So what am I supposed to do now , sit around and worry all day ? [ mice squeaking ] What ? Dinner and a show ? You and I have some work to do . [ exhaling ] Work with me . What do I have to do to strengthen our bond ? [ gasping ] [ Shiro ] Whoa ! Hey ! What are you doing ? Stop . Stop ! I said stop ! Turn around . That 's an order ! [ Coran ] Hello ? Back passengers ? Can you hear me ? [ Lance ] Oh , it 's so comfy up here . Extra leg-room , heated seats ! Oh , man ! Stupid Lance . Stupid shotgun . Now , these swap moons are very dangerous environments . So be on your toes . No weapons or communication devices of any kind ! Also , I 've brought along some disguises . Coran ? This Unilu swap meet looks an awful lot like a regular mall . It does seem to be a little cleaner than I remember . Still , be vigilant . The Unilu are cut-throat wheeler-dealers . So keep your hands on your coin satchels . My satchels are empty . Good . Let 's just get this over with . Yes , right . Everyone , let 's fan out , search the area for teludav lenses . We 'll meet by the giant ticking clock here in one vaga . Don 't be late , and try to blend in . [ screen beeping ] What the ... Space pirates ! Disguising yourselves as harmless shoppers , huh ? Well , it won 't work . Don 't worry , Emperor Zarkon . I know you can 't be here to protect the mall ... but your faithful number two is on the case . Hope you pirates are ready to face Varkon . [ Shiro groaning ] Come on ! [ groaning ] I don 't know where you 're headed ... but you need to start listening to me right now ! That 's better . Where are we ? Why did you bring me here ? What are you trying to tell me ? [ gasping ] So you want me to see through your eyes . [ gasping ] Was this your home ? Okay , if I were a 10,000-year-old wormhole lens , where would I be ? Excuse me , hey , hi , excuse me , hi ! Wow , you guys are really booking here . So I was just wondering if you guys knew where I could find ... some lenses for my ship around here ? Is there a one-hour lens place around here or something ? Anything ? Nothing ? Never mind , you know what ? I 'll catch up with you guys later ! [ panting ] Oh ! This is beautiful ! [ chuckling ] Maybe the scaultrite is under these samples . I don 't know . Rubbery . Sweet and salty . So cold , but spicy . Mmm , eh ... What 's next , what do you got ? [ Vrepit Sal ] Five hundred GAC . Five hundred GAC . Excuse me ? Sustenance provided by Vrepit Sal , that 's me . Five hundred GAC is now owed . I thought this was a " free sample " situation . Free ? Of charge . You know , gratis ? Look , I don 't have any money . So , you know ... Oh , man ! How long you been here ? Sal put me in when I was just a little girl . Oh , no ! Let me show you this wonderful workings of the Galasu X-90 Extreme Blade System . It slices , it dices , it kills , slaughters , and skins ... and constantly stays razor sharp ! Look at it cut through this bloato fruit . Paper thin . How much would you pay for this knife ? But wait , there 's more ! How many times have you had to fight off a charging rock monster ... and then go immediately to a picnic ? All the time , right ? The Galasu can cut through rocks and still cut bloato fruit paper thin . Now how much would you pay ? Seriously , how much ? I have a lot of these to unload . I just had a question . Fine ! What do you got ? Have you ever come across something like this ? Whoa , this craftsmanship is incredible ! And is this a luxite blade ? The planet they mine that from hasn 't existed in decafebes . Where 'd you get this ? Someone gave it to me . Okay , that 's vague . Tell you what ... I 'll give you 1,000 GAC to take it off your hands . It 's not for sale . Two thousand . No , thanks . Give it back . How about this ? I keep the knife and you beat it before security gets here . I know it 's stolen . It 's not stolen . Then tell me where you got it . [ groaning ] [ grunting ] Hey ! Come back with that ! [ button beeping ] [ imitating motorcycle revving ] Trouble at the Slice Capades ? It 's one of those pirates ! I knew they looked edgy . Varkon 's comin ' for ya ! [ hoverbike whirring ] [ Shiro ] So this was Zarkon 's home planet . Show me more . [ Shiro ] King Alford built you from that comet . And you fought beside him . With Zarkon . [ gasping ] You ! [ mice squeaking ] [ giggling ] Absolutely stunning ! After we defeat Zarkon , I 'm taking you on the road ! [ mice squeaking ] [ toilet flushing ] I 'll just hold it . [ giggling ] Can I interest you in the latest Earth fashions ? Lance , come on ! We have to be back at the ticking clock in a half hour . But Pidge , wait , look at all this crazy Earth stuff this alien is selling ! We 're supposed to be looking for the teludav lenses ... and you 're looking in the one store we know for certain won 't have- - Oh , my gosh ! Is that Killbot Phantasm 1 ? The first journey to the depths of the demon sphere ? Oh ! Mercury Gameflux Two ! With the original power glove that gives you infinite lives if you touch the index finger to the pinky ! We have to have this ! How much is this ? Twelve hundred GAC . Is that a lot ? Well , compared to what we have , which is none , yes . It 's a lot . We 're gonna find some money . Come on ! Don 't sell that ! Don 't worry . I never sell anything . Do I , Kaltenecker ? [ Kaltenecker mooing ] Ah , one of the Unilu . [ whistling ] Like , can I help you ? Yes . Can you tell me where the " other " market is ? The what ? Well , some might call it the " black market . " I don 't think I know that . Maybe check there . I don 't think this would be " on " the map . It might be more " off-book . " Hm ? Maybe this will help you remember ? Again , what ? Ah , the old Unilu shakedown , eh ? [ chuckling ] Fine . Starting to get a fuzzy recollection yet ? Who is this ? - Is this you ? - No ! That 's King Groggery the Infirm ! You know what ? I 'll find it myself ! [ groaning ] I 'm so out of this dump . I gotta escape somehow . Maybe I can scrub through these cuffs . [ horn blows ] Forty-three ! Sustenance unit complete . - Ingest . - [ moaning ] - [ explosion ] - Huh ? [ robot buzzing ] Oh , not again ! Now who will be my sustenance preparer ? I got this , Sal . Un-cuff me . [ chuckling ] You ? Trust me . I 'm an enthusiastic gourmand with an incredible palate . Also , your robot is dead on the floor . That last part is true . All right , work . Okay , now watch this ! I can 't read this . Doesn 't matter . I 'll just improvise . Do you smell how the tanginess of tuber masture really brings out ... the charred flavor from the palmagoren fillet ? No , no , we won 't be using that . Let 's just say , " Number 44 ? Your order 's up . " Enjoy your meal . [ moaning ] What did you do to her face ? It 's cracking ! She 's smiling ! She 's enjoying her food . Okay , let 's provide some sustenance ! Show me more . Those wings ... You have powers I haven 't unlocked . Incredible ! I 've got you now , paladin . [ screaming ] You are a fool to face me here . When you die in this realm , your body dies as well . And then I will take control of Voltron . [ grunting ] [ yelling ] [ groaning ] [ grunting ] [ breathing heavily ] I 'll find you pirates ! [ hoverbike beeping ] What 's going on here ? Official business , excuse me , this is a fire hazard . I 'm in the middle of a hot pursuit . I said " over medium " . Over medium , you rube ! Does this look over medium to you ? No , Chef . Then let 's get it right , huh ? If it ain 't perfect , it ain 't coming out of this kitchen , people ! Sauce me ! Now you 're getting it ! - Bon app√©tit . - [ applause ] I got you now , pirate ! Where are your friends ? [ screaming ] Don 't forget what I taught you ! Those are the fundamentals of cooking ! That kid is a genius . I don 't care if we have to search the entire galaxy ! I want him back at Vrepit Sal 's ! [ Shiro panting ] You could never take my place as the head of Voltron . - [ yelling ] - [ grunting ] You can 't pilot the Black Lion after everything you 've done ! You can never lead Voltron again ! You 're no paladin ! [ groaning ] You have no idea how to command a weapon like this ! No one commands the Black Lion ! [ grunting ] You dare lecture me ? [ gasping ] Do you think the Black Lion would allow such a feeble creature to pilot it ? Only the powerful can command it . You 've forgotten what 's most important between a lion and its paladin . It 's not about power . It 's about earning each other 's trust . Trust has nothing to do with it . The lion is mine , forever . [ screaming ] Huh ? [ yelling ] No ! Sire , what is it ? My connection grows weaker . We must hurry if we ever wish to reclaim Voltron ! Did you just save me ? Thank you . Let 's go home . [ gasping ] We never left . Oh , this tenner looks like the last one . So how much have we got ? Eleven hundred and ninety-six GAC . We 're so close ! Lance , look ! Already on it ! Yeah ! Let 's go ! [ laughing ] Thanks ! Gotta hide ! Gotta hide ! [ toilet flushing ] Keith ! He 's right behind me ! Who ? [ hoverbike beeping ] Pirate number two ! My lucky day ! [ yelping ] Hold on . With every purchase , you get a free Kaltenecker . Time to get moving , guys ! Security 's on our tail ! There 's the rest of the crew ! [ yelping ] [ panting ] Everyone up on Kaltenecker ! Did you buy a cow ? It was free with purchase ! [ everyone screaming ] Hold on a tick , this looks familiar ! Oh , lookie-lookie . An original Unilu swap shop ! [ sighing ] Good eye , friend . This shop 's been in my family since before the empire began . Can I interest you in a butcher barrel ? Or perhaps a set of window breakers ? Teludav lenses ! Yes ! I mean , I don 't have any idea what these pieces of junk are . I see you 've got your eye on these antique glass table toppers here . Well , they 're pretty ugly . But I do have an empty curio cabinet for grotesqueries . How much do you want ? How much have you got ? Oh , I have a handful of pocket lint . I 'll take your first-born child . I might be able to throw in a used handkerchief . - I could accept your left foot . - I 'd be willing to sing you a song ! You become my butler for one year . - Two Altean crown bills . - Five Valuvium ingots . Oh , would you accept an IOU ? Of course . I 'll just need some collateral . Maybe ten Valuvium ingots ! Or how about this ? One Olkari flying cube . - You 've got a deal ! - [ giggling ] - There he is ! - We gotta go , Coran ! [ panting ] I got the scaultrite lenses ! Scaultrite ? Hold on a tick ! No take-backs ! Get back here ! [ screaming ] Doggone it ! You better run ! Don 't let me catch you in my jurisdiction again , pirates ! Oh , so you can 't follow us outside , huh ? [ taunting , yelping ] [ grunting ] That 's one for Varkon . We got our lenses ! Excellent ! Now , we can get the teludav up and running . Where 's Shiro ? What did you do ? Take a nap ? Not exactly . Is that a cow ? Mm-hmm , his name is Kaltenecker . [ mooing ] So , did you find a way to bond with your lion ? Yes , and we need to get moving . We 're headed for the Blade of Marmora 's headquarters . I 'll plot a course . While you 're doing that , I 'm gonna hook up the video game Lance and I bought . Yeah ! Let 's get this baby set up . Where can we ... How do ... [ Pidge ] No !

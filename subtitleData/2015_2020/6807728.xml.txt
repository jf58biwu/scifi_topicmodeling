[ electronic chirp distorting ] [ knocking continues ] Michele ? A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [ theme music playing ] CHAPTER 08 BUTTON Michele ! [ sighs ] [ Ezequiel ] That room is empty . Hello . Please ... Good morning . Ezequiel , right ? - Michele used to sleep here- - - She has been eliminated . What ? There must be a misunderstanding . She passed the individual test . - She was at the feast- - - The candidate was eliminated . We found inconsistencies with her registration . She was taken to the gates a few minutes ago . None of you noticed any odd behavior ? You didn 't find anything off about her ? - No . - No . Let 's not worry about it , Fernando . You 're almost to the Offshore . Ezequiel ! [ Fernando exhales ] I 'd like to quit . What did you say ? I 'd like to quit . Have you lost your mind ? You made it this far . Very few do . Why do you want to quit ? I 'm sorry , but I want to leave now . Then come with me . [ groans ] CONGRATULATIONS , JOANA ! THE MERIT IS ALL YOURS [ laughing ] - Fernando , are you sure about this ? - Yes . [ panting ] Michele . Michele . Michele . Michele ? Michele ? Michele ! Michele ! - Hi , Fernando . - Hey . Congratulations . The test you created was very interesting . - It 's a pity you 've been eliminated . - Yes , because I quit . You 've shown resistance to the Process since the Survival stage . - But it was your own test that got you . - Look , I 'm quitting because I want to . Because Michele was eliminated . Wasn 't she ? It 's a shame that your motivation to pass wasn 't strong enough . What ? - Instructions for your recovery ... - Where 's Michele ? - I wanna talk to her . Wait ! - Try not to reminisce - or talk about what happened here . - Where is she ? Where 's Michele ? Where is she ? Open up ! Michele ! Michele ! Michele ! [ grunting ] [ Ezequiel ] Get her out of there ! [ gasps , coughs ] Get her out , right now ! [ Michele coughing , gasping ] [ Ezequiel ] What have they done to you ? You 're dismissed . No , please . No . Cássia and I have suspected you from the start . [ coughs ] Your friend Bruna didn 't really fit the profile . [ groaning ] Why do you want to kill me ? Hm ? - Why so much anger ? - [ gasps ] Why so much anger , Michele ? I 'm here to protect you . I just want to talk to you . You try to kill me , murder one of my agents ... César was very dear to us , Michele . If the other agents find out , - they 'll want your head . - [ sobbing ] And me ? What do you think I might want from you , Michele ? In exchange for not eliminating you right now ? [ sobs ] [ sighs ] Help me out , please . Tell me ... why do you want to kill me ? Look , Michele , I 'm not leaving until you give me an answer . [ shouts ] Tell me ! You ... killed my brother . You killed ... my brother . - I killed your brother ? - [ sobs ] And you 're seeking revenge ? Is that it ? Go on . [ man ] I ... I 'd like to apologize . I came very close . I did my best , but on my individual test- - [ Ivana ] Don 't worry about it . You did your best . And the Cause acknowledges that . But the fight must go on and that 's why you 're here now . [ older man ] Can you tell us if any of these agents ... made it to the last stage ? - Her ? - I saw her going into an individual room . Near the end . I think she 's still in . Anyone else ? Yes ... but I never would 've guessed he was one of us , too . Thank you , comrade . [ Ivana ] We 'll find you soon for your next mission . For now , the fight goes on . For the Cause . For the Cause . Two ! Can you believe it ? Yes . Finally , we did it ! Her ... I recruited her . She was a lot of trouble . A lot . Jorge didn 't trust her ... but it all worked out in the end . She was confident . Now , this boy , he wasn 't in my group . I don 't know what to expect from him . [ woman over speakers ] Dear candidates , now that you 're almost to the Offshore ... RAFAEL ON YOUR WAY TO THE 3 % ... please come to the garden to go through Purification . - [ knocking ] - [ man ] Let 's go . Your friends are ready and waiting . [ birds calling ] I 'm sorry about César . It 's time to get on with your new lives . - Welcome . - Thank you . [ all chattering excitedly ] Come on , Joana ! What are you waiting for ? - Mm ! - [ chuckles ] Copycat . Joana . Have you seen Fernando ? He and Michele haven 't shown up , so I don 't know . Is there a problem ? I don 't know what you said to Fernando , but if it were up to me you wouldn 't be here . Ha . Yeah , but I am still here . In fact , I 'm in the Purification with you . So , if we 're gonna live in the same place , if our families are gonna be neighbors , if my kids are gonna play with yours ... maybe you should start looking at me in a different light . - Joana . Congratulations . - Thank you . There 's a lot to purify , but it 's just a matter of time . Ezequiel would like to have a word with you . Come with me ? Only me ? It 's a routine chat . Hello ! Is anybody there ? [ man ] You have to stay in your room until the transportation to Offshore ! Please ! Please , open the door ! Please ! I know I was wrong ! I do ! - Calm down . You need to stay here . - Listen , listen , listen . I need to ask the widow 's forgiveness . You know her name ? Luciana . Ask her to come here . I need her forgiveness . - Calm down . - Please ! I know I was wrong ! Why ? Why do you think I killed your brother ? [ soft gasp ] He was with the Cause . Your brother , André Santana , was with the Cause ? That 's unlikely . But even more unlikely is that someone who was tortured and killed by me ... could pose for a photo on the Offshore in such a lively manner . André Santana . No . Doesn 't he look a little older to you ? - I 'd say ... - That 's not real . - ... about five years after his " death . " - No . Your brother was never with the Cause . He went to the Offshore after the first Process I led five years ago . - That 's a lie . - That 's the truth . [ sobs ] No ! That 's how they recruited you , right ? " Join the Cause to avenge the death of innocents and end segregation . " - They trained you hard for five years . - [ sobbing ] They indoctrinated you , made you see things ... all in the name of a lie . Who recruited you ? [ groans ] Tell me . [ spits , groans ] Was it the person who told you exactly how I tortured your brother ? How I killed him ? Because that is a recruitment technique made up by an old man . - [ coughing ] - A resentful and hateful old man ... who seeks everyone 's pity from behind a wooden mask . I know him well . When we used to meet , he didn 't always wear the hood . I was with the Cause , Michele . But , thankfully , I left that childish ideology ... a long time ago . You believe you 're fighting against the world 's injustices and that by destroying the Process , you will find equality . But the truth is that there are no heroes or villains . No inequality or injustice . Because we know there is only one difference between people : those who have merit and those who do not . Period . Look . This old man who destroyed your life ... it 's him I want . Tell me where to find him ... and I 'll consider letting you go . - I won 't talk . - Michele . I won 't ... talk . Don 't try anything stupid , okay ? I 'll leave you and your brother alone for a while . [ knocking on recording ] - [ man ] What , honey ? - [ woman ] Come here . - I can 't even use the restroom anymore ? - Come here , quick ! Stop filming me , I 'm using the restroom . Can 't I do that in peace ? Stop , seriously . Stop . Turn the camera off . Enough . Turn it off . - [ knocking on recording ] - Come here ! - Come here , quick ! - [ Michele sobs ] - Turn it off . - I want to see my brother . - [ recording continues indistinctly ] - I want to see my brother ! [ sobbing ] You couldn 't have involved me in this . Especially now ! Everything is being questioned . Corruption is all people worry about . - Nair ... - And those who think that you- - Calm down . I appreciate what you 're doing , but I ask you to remain calm and trust me . Trust you ? How , Ezequiel , when you leave during the Process only to be seen with a child in the Inland ? - So , you know . - Of course I know . You ask me to switch Aline 's report and you think I won 't look at it first ? Who do you think I am ? It 's insane , Ezequiel . Helping Julia 's son ? [ stammers ] It ... It was a moment of weakness . I did what I did because of our friendship . But that stops now . I 'm not supporting you anymore . - Nair ... - Our communication ceases here . Nair , you 're the only one I trust . - The only one ! - Too bad I can 't say the same . They said you wanted to ask forgiveness . Not exactly , but I need you to listen to me . It wasn 't me . - I can 't deal with you right now . - No , please . Why would I kill César ? Why ? Ezequiel ... had to get rid of me . He fabricated this lie . I swear . I swear ! I swear , it wasn 't me ! It wasn 't me ! Aline , if you 're going to keep lying , why did you call me here ? Because I know it 's just as important to you as it is to me to find out what really happened last night . For Ezequiel and the Council , this was just a political issue . They already dealt with it . By using me . But you and I need to find out what really happened . Close the door , please . [ door closes ] I 'm sorry for my tardiness , my dear chosen ones . Please , come closer . You are here for the Purification ritual . Purification serves to cleanse you of a great evil of society . The vaccine will sterilize you . - What ? - I 'm sure you must be wondering why . So was I , over 20 years ago , before I learned to look at the world the right way . I 'll never have children ? Not me . Not you . No one . None of us . No way . There are no kids on the Offshore ? We don 't have kids on the Offshore precisely because heredity ... was the biggest injustice that sustained the outrageous world we lived in . That was the Founding Couple 's biggest accomplishment . Their greatest lesson . They were the first to not bear children . And they taught us ... that the true path to building a superior society ... is merit . And the only way to evaluate true merit ... is through the Process . Because you will know for certain that you 've earned these privileges . You fought for them and deserve them . So , there is no room for doubt , guilt , melancholy . No . And now ... it is my pleasure to be among you . Among the future . You ... are the real children of the Offshore . If anyone would like to quit now ... please inform Bernardo . If you 'd like to continue on ... simply follow this path ... where you will undergo your Purification . I hope you make the right decision . - What the fuck ? - He 's right . Right ? - Yes , he 's right . - You don 't care ? About not having kids ? Being sterilized ? What the hell ? I never wanted to have kids . Fuck it . We can still have sex . And not have to worry about it . Later , guys . [ device whirring ] [ people in unison ] Welcome to the three percent ! [ applause ] [ Cássia ] Joana ? Ezequiel is dealing with some things and he 'll be with you in a minute . Am I the only one going through this confirmation ? I would look at it more like a privilege than an actual test . I also had to go through this confirmation when I became head of security . Ezequiel must have seen some special quality in you . As he saw in me , at the time . Trust him . He has his reasons . Stop filming me , I 'm using the restroom . Can I do this in peace ? Stop it . Stop . I 'm serious . - [ recording continues looping ] - [ door opens ] - I want to see my brother . - I can make that happen . - I wanna see my brother , right now ! - But first you have to do your part . Think about it . That old son of a bitch put you in this situation . Between you and me , who 's the real killer ? I didn 't kill your brother . But you ... you must be feeling pretty guilty . First Bruna , a totally innocent girl . Then , César . Truth be told , Michele , those deaths weren 't your fault . You were manipulated . And I 'm offering a chance for redemption . Forgiveness for your murders . Think carefully , Michele . All you need to do is tell me how you 'd meet with him ... if you were eliminated and had to return to the Inland . That 's all . [ device whirring ] [ people in unison ] Welcome to the three percent ! [ applause ] [ device whirring ] - [ device whirring ] - [ cheers and applause ] - [ device whirring ] - Welcome to the three percent ! [ applause ] You came here to get revenge , which will never be a form of justice . What I 'm giving you right now is the opportunity to bring to justice the real villain in this story . Easy . Calm down , relax . You made it this far , you can 't give up now . You have the chance for a better life on the Offshore . Trust us . Go on . You 're going , too ? Yes . [ Ezequiel ] Free yourself . Come on , Michele . Take advantage of this and free yourself . Rafael , you can 't just think of yourself . - I want a better life for my children . - You know nothing about children . Come on , come on , Michele ! Free yourself from this guilt ! Free yourself , Michele . It 's about everyone 's children , not just yours . Come on , Michele , take this opportunity and free yourself ! If I was eliminated , I was supposed to meet him ... - If the four caps are grouped together ... - If the four caps are grouped together you 'll find him . Where ? Tell me where . - [ woman ] Rafael ! - [ cheers and applause ] Welcome , Rafael . [ woman ] Repeat after me : " I agree ... " [ Rafael ] I agree ... [ woman ] " ... to sacrifice my reproductive ability ... " [ Rafael ] ... to sacrifice my reproductive ability ... [ woman ] " ... in the name of a fair society ... " [ Rafael ] ... in the name of a fair society ... [ woman ] " ... and to only enter the Offshore ... " [ Rafael ] ... and to only enter the Offshore ... [ woman ] " ... duly purified . " ... duly purified . Relax your arm . [ whirring ] [ all ] Welcome to the three percent ! [ cheering ] Welcome to the three percent , Michele . Anyone else in my place would have killed you . Why didn 't you ? Michele , I 've been in your shoes , exactly where you are . And I only came this far because I 've been on both sides and chose the right one . Only someone who 's been through that can be certain of their convictions . Someone like me . And like you . I 'm taking you to the Offshore . I 'll admit you into the Recovery and Treatment Center and I will personally supervise your progress . And every once in a while , I 'll bring your brother . Now , tell me ... who else do you know ? - Just the old man . - And inside the Process ? Apart from you , is there any other infiltrator from the Cause ? - No . - I know there 's someone else . - Michele , you better tell me now . - There 's no one else . - You will regret this later . - There is no one else . I wanted to leave a better world for my kids . But Ezequiel 's words made sense , and I 'll leave a better world for the children of the Offshore . All right . Hello , Joana . - Hi . Is everything okay ? - Yes . Relax . Have a seat , please . I just want to confirm your full abilities . It 's a test . But it 's only because I think you can be more than just an ordinary citizen on the Offshore . You 've followed the path of a warrior , and I see tremendous potential in you . I resorted to this strategy because the Offshore is in great danger . Danger ? Our citizens must understand the difference between us ... and them . [ inaudible dialogue ] This man ... you know him , don 't you ? He can 't see you . [ screaming ] A criminal . He extorts , steals ... When he came to the Process , he was eliminated on the first interview . A model citizen from the Offshore ... cannot have inappropriate feelings toward them . The 97 percent . This button represents a clean break from any ties with the Inland . You just need to push it . - What does it do ? - It confirms you 're one of us . Someone special enough to work with me and who will improve the Offshore . Will he die ? Painlessly . [ no sound ] Remember what we talked about . Now it 's time to reap your reward for all that you suffered in this filthy and corrupt world . You deserve a better life . [ whispers ] Joana ... he deserves to die . Push the button , Joana . Prove to yourself that you deserve a better life . Push the button . Push the button . No ! I 'm not a killer . We both know that 's not true , don 't we ? [ soft chuckle ] I was wrong , then . I 'm ashamed to have bet on you . You 're weak . You 're nothing . [ ragged breaths ] [ laughing ] [ laughter grows louder ] I shouldn 't have listened to you , Ezequiel . You think you can change everyone 's mind , but you can 't . Sometimes it may seem like it , but no . You 're nothing more than a piece of trash from the Inland . - Trash ? - Trash . - I 'm trash ? - Yes . Look at you . Telling me the Offshore was made for people like me . No . It was made for people like you ! A sorry man who thinks he 's better than everyone else . But who 's just an asshole ! A piece of shit ! Who just has this shitty Process to play king with . - Can 't you see how ridiculous this is ? - Get out . There isn 't an ounce of humanity left in you . - Get out . - You are trash . Get out ! Before I put you in that chair ! Go ! I 'm leaving ! [ Elza Soares " A Mulher do Fim do Mundo " playing ] See you on the Offshore ? I don 't think so . Joana ? You know very well that candidates aren 't allowed in here . I 'm not a candidate . Nine-six-one . [ panting ] Michele ? Michele . Michele . Joana , have you seen Michele ? Do you know where she is ? Did she pass ? She must have passed . The Process just wants the worst ones . I thought you had passed , too , that everything had gone well . - What happened ? - No one on the Offshore cares about anyone in the Inland . That 's how it 's always been and that 's how it will always be . Until someone does something about it . Yeah . Let 's go , Fernando . It 'll be dark soon . No , I 'm staying . I have to wait for Michele . I won 't leave without her . That 's not going to happen . Let 's go . Come on . [ Daniel ] This is for my aunt . She didn 't believe in me , but I 'm here . I 'm alive , right here . People don 't seem excited , huh ? Let 's party . Have a drink . Is everyone there ? [ sighs ] [ giggling ] [ laughing ] [ both continue laughing ] Zé ! Zé ! Look who 's heading down . Wheels and that other girl . They already made it back ! Hello ! Welcome ! [ cackling ] Just letting you know we 're closing up for next year , and the selected candidates are ready for transport . Okay . And also , to ask you about Joana ... I 'm curious . Excuse me . - The Founding Couple is coming ! - [ all ] Amen ! They will return . Yes , they will return to show that the Process is the only way ! - Amen ! - That justice rules in the world ! Amen ! That the best is reserved only for the best ! Amen ! And that our duty is to raise and send them to the Process ! Amen ! - We must accept their superiority ! - Amen ! Because only the Process can save our world ! Amen ! And those who stand against it will perish in the cruelest of hells ! Amen ! FIGHTING FOR EVERYONE [ Fernando 's father ] Amen . You think you can change everyone 's mind ! But you can 't . [ Ezequiel ] Only three percent of you will be part of a select group of heroes heading to the Offshore . Only the deserving three percent . Remember , you create your own merit . No matter what happens ... you deserve this .

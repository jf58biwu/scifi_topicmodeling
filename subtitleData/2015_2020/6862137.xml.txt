 [ alarm blaring ] Zarkon ! How did he find us ? His commanders must have radioed him from Olkarion . We need to wormhole , now ! Everyone to your stations . We 've got to put some distance between us and Zarkon . - This could be the fight of our lives . - [ groans ] [ Hunk ] That 's sure a lot of fighters . Allura , can you evade these fighters ? We can 't have them following us through the wormhole . I can try . [ Shiro ] Keith , Lance , let 's lay down some covering fire . [ grunts ] Lance , incoming , 12 o 'clock high ! [ Lance ] Got it ! - Hey ! - [ Keith ] Sorry ! Gotta be quick ! - How 's that for quick ? - You ... Knock it off , you two ! Stay in your zones ! - Yeah , Keith ! - Keep calling out those fighters , Pidge . Hunk , how are the defenses holding ? I don 't know . Ten percent ? Fifteen maybe ? Everything 's a blur . I 've been up too long . I have tired eyes ! I know we just came off an intense battle , but we 've got to stay focused , just until we jump . [ Keith ] And when is that ? [ Coran ] They 're still too close ! We need to gain more speed ! - I 've got an idea ! Hold on ! - [ grunts ] [ Pidge ] Allura , what are you doing ? I 'm going to use this moon 's gravity to gain speed and put some distance between us and Zarkon . [ all grunting ] We 're clear to wormhole ! [ Lance ] We got away from Zarkon , how come we 're still on alert ? - [ Shiro ] Coran , what 's going on ? - Oh , no ! Teludav lens malfunction ! We 're about to exit this wormhole a lot sooner than we planned ! [ Lance ] Whoa . Where are we ? Looks like some sort of iceberg graveyard . - Coran , what 's the status ? - [ Coran ] Checking that now . We didn 't make it to our exit point , but we 're several galaxies from Zarkon 's fleet . - Allura ! - [ all ] Allura ! [ Coran ] Oh , no , you look exhausted . You must rest . You 've been exerting way too much energy . I 'll go check on the main turbine and figure out what 's going- - [ screaming ] Whoa ! Are you all right ? [ groans ] I 'm fine . Look , I tell you what , I 've probably hit a slippery spot on the ground there . Someone please wipe that up there ! You 're sweating . You might have a case of the slipperies . What ? No ! No , that 's an old person virus , and I 'm not old . I 'm young . Well , young-ish . What are the slipperies ? It 's a common Altean virus that occurs later in life . It 's not harmful and usually only lasts a couple of days , but it causes one 's body to secrete extremely slick fluid . - Ew ! - Gross ! Yes , it is gross , so it 's a good thing I don 't have it ! Coran , it 's nothing to be embarrassed about . I 'm not embarrassed because I don 't have it ! And , now , I 'm actually going to leave because I 've got to fix the main turbine ! [ whimpering , screaming ] Quiznak ! [ screaming ] All right . Since Zarkon has no idea where we are , this is the perfect time to focus on our next step . Maybe we can find that secret group , the Blade of Marmora . - Pidge , where are those coordinates ? - [ groans ] Wait , hang on . - I 'm so tired , my brain 's not working . - Yeah , neither is mine . [ Coran ] Hello , all . I 've checked the engines . That was fast . Well , I slipped right down- - [ groans ] I mean , hurried down . Anyway , the good news is , the Galra fighter did minimal damage . I flushed the turbine and it 's fine . The bad news is , the teludav , or wormholer , as you Earthlings call it , is in bad shape . Several scaultrite lens-stones of the magnifying beam generator are cracked . As you know , the magnifying beam generator uses a crystal to convert Altean energy into usable fuel . That supplies the power needed to wormhole . Well , anyway , I need to remove the cracked lenses and readjust their trajectory temporarily until we can replace them . I 'll also need to divert power to make up for the lost energy . Anyway , it 's going to take at least a quintant . All right . We 'll hide the ship and get some rest while Coran comes up with a work-around . Tomorrow , we 'll be sharper and refocused . Huh ? What the heck do you think you 're doing ? Allura said there 's a pool . I 'm gonna go check it out . - What do you think you 're doing ? - [ sighs ] Same thing . Look , you stay on one side of the pool and I 'll stay on the other , and we 'll be far , far away from each other . Very ... far ... away . [ Keith ] Hm ? [ Lance ] Uh ... [ both sigh ] I thought you were exhausted . Why are you making cookies ? Because baking clears my head , Pidge . Okay ? I thought you were gonna help Coran with the wormholer . One mention of the slipperies and he got all sensitive and kicked me out . I hate not being able to read Altean . What is this stuff ? Are you sure you 're making food ? You 're gonna try and tell me that these aren 't cookies ? [ groans ] Okay , I might have overcooked them . Wait , where you going ? You don 't want to wait for the next batch ? [ grunting ] [ straining ] It 's right , then left . You 're off . - You 're off ! And shoving too hard ! - You 're not shoving hard enough ! - I should be at the pool right now ! - Would you stop whining ? Huh ? - Look ! - Huh ? [ screaming ] [ both screaming ] [ both groan ] - [ grunting ] - Huh ? [ Lance ] What the heck ? [ Keith ] Stupid Altean pools . [ computer ] Welcome to introductory Altean . Awesome ! I 'm finally gonna learn the Altean language ! Level , beginner . Safety , off . Safety ? That 's weird . Klanm端irl . Klan-mural . - [ beeping ] - Hm ? Uh , what 's that ? - Klanm端irl . - [ growling ] Klan-mirl ? [ screaming ] [ roars ] - Klanm端irl ! Klanm端irl ! - [ beeping ] [ sighs ] Huh ? Xznly Squiwl . Oh , quiznak . What are you doing here ? You should be resting . I cannot sleep . Zarkon is out there . He 's searching for us . I know how you feel , but you have to step away for a while . It 's what 's best for everyone . [ both gasp ] [ alarm blaring ] We are several galaxies away . How could they find us so soon ? Oh , no ! My good batch ! [ yelps , groans ] [ gurgling ] - [ screaming ] - [ groaning ] [ grunting ] Huh ? [ Allura ] Particle barrier up ! - Coran , are you there ? - I 'm here ! [ screams ] - Over here ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Zarkon is back ! What 's our status ? Wormholing will be a problem . The lenses haven 't been readjusted ! I don 't know if the teludav will generate enough power . - Do everything you can ! - They found us again ? How is that possible ? Is that possible ? That doesn 't seem possible ! [ grunts ] Right now , we must figure out a way to get out of here . Or we can stay and fight . Now 's our chance . Form Voltron . Enough running ! It 's too dangerous ! Allura 's right . We can 't take on Zarkon and his entire fleet . Remember what happened at Zarkon 's command center . We wouldn 't have escaped if the Blade of Marmora hadn 't shut down the shield . The turbine 's up . Still working on the worm- - [ screams ] [ groans , screams ] Uh , guys , I think I 'm realizing now that I do , in fact , have a case of the slipperies . I 'm sorry I yelled at you , Pidge . I may need your help , after all . - I 'm coming down . - [ Shiro ] Let 's clear a path . [ Keith ] Lance , there 's a fighter advancing on your nine ! Thanks for the heads-up ! And you 've got one going for the lower barrier . [ Keith ] Good eye ! What can I do ? Help me divert power . Slide me to that monitor ! - Wipe my sweat ! - [ grunting ] Okay , buddy , you 're mine . What 's going on ? I lost control of my defense drone ! I got you covered ! Uh , I don 't got you . Oh , there must be a system failure . - Nope , that was us ! - [ Coran screaming ] We 're diverting power from non-essential systems to get the wormhole generator working . Shooting bad guys is pretty essential ! [ Hunk ] We lost secondary controls ! Thermal regulator 's offline ! Oh , no , there goes the particle barrier ! Okay , try it ! We should be able to make one very small jump ... I hope . [ Pidge ] Is it gonna hold ? [ Coran ] I guess we 're about to find out . The wormhole 's open ! Oh , no ! The lenses are breaking down even more ! We 'll be out of the wormhole even sooner this time ! [ Shiro ] Zarkon keeps finding us . It 's like he knows how to track us down . Maybe he planted some kind of tracking device . Well , it is nothing on the ship . The Castle would have detected any tracking devices . Until we figure out exactly how he 's doing it , we should assume that he could show up at any minute . - So , stay alert . - [ snoring ] Oh , man ! Oh , what 's going on ? What are you guys doing ? What are you looking at ? - You woke yourself up snoring . - My bad . - Coran , what 's our status ? Any good news ? - Actually , there is a bit of good news . I 'm finally getting used to these slipperies . My mucus glands are working at an incredible rate ! Any good news about the teludav ? I 'm afraid not . The last jump overloaded the lens-stones . Now , even more of them are broken . I 'm going to try some readjustments to change the beam trajectory . Until then , wormholing away will be impossible . Hey , there 's a giant metallic storm ahead of us . I think we can hide in the eye of the storm . It should give off enough interference so we can 't be tracked . It 's worth a shot . [ Allura ] Brilliant , Pidge . We 're essentially invisible to any radar , radio waves , universal scans , or any other known technology . - [ alarm blaring ] - [ gasps ] No ! Send in the fighters , flush them out . When they are within range , I will take control of the Black Lion . Okay , I don 't know how he found us , but it definitely wasn 't with normal instruments . It 's me . It 's been me all along . That 's how they found us on planet Arus . [ groans ] It doesn 't matter , Princess . We 're in this together . We 're gonna get out together . Uh , how ? We 're trapped . We need to form Voltron and go through the storm . The storm ? What are you , nuts ? Yeah ! [ stammering ] What do you mean ? Yeah , why would we do that ? It 's risky , I know , but it 's our only chance . We have to go through the storm , then lure Zarkon 's ship away , giving Allura some time to get into open space . - Then , what ? - Then , we wormhole away . Coran , remember how you said getting this Castle to wormhole is impossible ? Well , I need you to do the impossible . Form Voltron ! [ roars ] Team , let 's draw those fighters out ! [ Keith ] I think it 's working ! They 're following us ! - How 's it coming , Coran ? - In order for this to work , each remaining lens-stone will need to take the equivalent of five beams ! There 's no way it can hold that kind of power ! The whole thing will explode ! - We 've lost them in the storm ! - They won 't be in there long . [ Keith ] They can 't follow us in this storm ! It 's tearing them apart ! [ Hunk ] The debris ! It 's gonna tear us apart if we don 't do something ! - Pidge , we 're gonna need that shield ! - On it ! - And , Keith , the sword ! - Yes , sir ! [ Shiro ] Legs , I need everything you got ! - Roger ! Engaging lower thrusters ! - I 'm right there with ya ! Get me closer to the Black Lion . Sire , we have the Princess trapped . We can finish her now ! The Black Lion is all that matters ! Coran , here we go ! [ Hunk ] It worked ! They escaped ! [ all yelling ] [ Keith ] What 's going on ? [ Hunk ] My lion ! [ groaning ] Zarkon ... [ Shiro ] Zarkon 's taking control of the Black Lion again ! Fall back ! [ grunting ] [ Haggar screaming ] [ screams ] Paladins , now 's your chance ! Get out of there ! I forgot how intense Zarkon 's connection to the Black Lion is . We have to keep our distance , or risk losing Voltron . Let 's disband and get back to the Castle . [ growls ] Attack that Castle with everything we 've got ! Capture Voltron ! Why haven 't we wormholed yet ? Because we can 't ! We 're missing several scaultrite lens-stones ! They 've shattered ! Gone ! Don 't exist ! Sloven-day-ho ! That 's Altean for " gone . " Wait , did you say " scaultrite " ? I 've seen that somewhere before . I think Hunk was making some terrible cookies from that stuff ! [ growls ] Unbelievable ! These cookies do have trace elements of scaultrite . - Could they work ? - They might be able to hold for one jump , but we 'd still need several people actually physically holding them . And , if the trajectories were calculated just so ... [ grunting ] It just warms my heart that people are enjoying my cookies . Okay , there . Now , nobody move if you want to live . I think I moved ! I think I moved ! Well , then move back to where you think you were ! Okay , now , I 'm going to monitor the beam from out there . Wait , Coran ! How dangerous is this ? Honestly , this is the most dangerous thing I 've ever seen , or heard of , but since we 're probably going to die anyway , what the heck , let 's give it a shot ! Good luck , gentlemen and gentlelady . It 's been a pleasure . Don 't touch the lasers ! Uh ... They 're in position ! We 're gonna die ! We 're gonna die ! We 're gonna die ! Hold tight , Lance ! [ screaming ] Hm ? It 's not working ! Coran , what 's happening ? Zarkon 's right on top of us ! The stones aren 't reflecting properly ! I need something to shine them up ! Oh ... Wait a second . I think I 've got it . Hit the wormhole in ten ticks ! [ Allura ] Ten ... - What 's happening ? - ... nine ... No one move ! I 've got to shine these stones ! Good thing I 've got a case of the slipperies ! ... six ... five ... four ... three ... - two ... - Huh ? ... one ! [ all screaming ] [ grunting ] [ yelling ] [ all screaming ] Great work , team ! We made it ! Huh ? [ all groaning ] [ yelps ] We were close , sire , but it appears they were able to make a full jump . There is no place in this universe beyond my vision 's reach . Time is on my side . Set a course for Voltron .

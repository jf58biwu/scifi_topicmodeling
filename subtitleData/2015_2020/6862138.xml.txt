 [ Robo-warrior ] Stay back . You have already taken all our supplies and resources . My people are loaded on that ark , ready to leave our beloved home ... before it dissolves completely . Don 't take our only means of escape . You still have one engine left , Baujal . Not to mention a very viable collection of parts . If your people are strong enough to survive , they will . That is the Galra way . Morvok ! [ grunts ] [ Allura ] There 's no point in debating this further . Zarkon is clearly tracking us through me . [ Lance ] Aww , space baloney . [ Pidge ] That 's not possible . Why would that be so hard to believe ? Zarkon 's forces showed up on Arus only after I awoke . She 's got a point . I would absolutely travel across the galaxy to find you . It 's not you , Princess Allura . It 's me . Because ? I just think Zarkon must 've imprinted on me during our fight or something . Look , the fact is , we don 't know how Zarkon is tracking us . It could be through the Black Lion . Every time Zarkon gets close to it , Shiro has to fight him for control . That 's only when Zarkon is nearby . No Paladin has ever been able to connect with a lion over a vast distance . So what are we going to do ? Look , it doesn 't matter how he 's tracking us because we 're gonna take the fight to the Galra soon enough . They 've been chasing us from galaxy to galaxy . The last thing they expect is for us to come after them . The hunter becomes the hunted , hmm ? Awesome ! That 's the tag line from like six of my favorite movies . As it happens , I took our list of recent Galra attacks and analyzed it for both commonalities and anomalies among the attack sites . I was hoping to create an algorithm that would , within a statistically acceptable margin of error , provide a list of target-rich Galra environments- - color-coded , of course , because what are we , animals ? [ Lance ] Cool ! What is it again ? [ Hunk ] It 's a Galra finder ? Well , " finder " suggests that it locates the Galra , whereas it would be more accurate to say that my model predicts their likeliest ... Fine . It 's a Galra finder . So , where are the Galra ? [ Pidge ] The nearest ones are right here . A planet called Taujeer . Then that 's where we 're headed . Everyone should get some sleep . Tomorrow , we 'll find that Galra fleet and take it out . Is everything okay ? Yeah . Why ? You just seem a bit anxious . I 'm fine . Just tired . Like you said , I should get some sleep . - [ alarm buzzing ] - Huh ? [ growling ] What 's the matter , Red ? It 's me . [ snarling ] [ panting ] I can find you anywhere . [ gasps and panting ] - [ door slides open ] - Huh ? Princess , what are you doing here ? Oh . I might ask you the same thing . Nothing . Just walking . Late at night . Near the pods . In full Paladin armor , with a bag of your belongings ? [ sighs ] I have to know if Zarkon is tracking me . This is the only way . Don 't try to stop me . I 'm not going to stop you . I 'm going to join you . We should be entering Taujeer 's orbit soon . [ Shiro ] Raise the particle barrier . Scan for Galra . Where are Keith and Allura ? It appears that one of the pods launched in the middle of the night . Wait a minute , Keith and Allura ? In the middle of the night ? You don 't think they 're sittin ' in a tree ? - Contact the pod . - Yes ! Contact that pod ! [ Coran ] Princess , Keith , where are you ? Exactly where we should be , far away from the Castle . [ Shiro ] What ? Why ? We must know if we are the ones Zarkon is tracking . They 're isolating the variable . Well , isolating two variables . [ Lance ] In English , please ? In order to test a hypothesis ... - I said English ! - [ groans ] Never mind ! Pidge is right . If Zarkon finds you despite my absence , we will know with total certainty that we are not the ones he is tracking . [ Shiro ] Splitting up the group makes us far more vulnerable . Come back to the Castle immediately . I 'm sorry , Shiro , I cannot do that . If Zarkon does find us , I can pilot us to safety . We 're in wide-open space with plenty of room to maneuver . Plus , we 'd be able to outrun him . Pidge added that booster rocket . That thing 's still on there ? - We need both of you back here now ! - [ all screaming ] What 's goin ' on ? [ Hunk ] We 're in some sort of debris field . I believe it 's coming from Taujeer . Correction : I think it is Taujeer ! [ Allura ] Coran , what 's going on- - [ static ] Some kind of radiation from the planet is interfering with communications ! Move the Castle away from the planet and reestablish the link . Everyone else , get to your lions . [ gasps ] Something 's approaching ! I don 't see any Galra . Looks like that fancy Galra finder doesn 't work . Nice try , Pidge . Thank goodness you 're here ! I am Baujal , the leader of the Taujeerians . The Galra just destroyed our ship 's engines and left . - So the Galra were here . Lance . - Mmm . They 've taken everything . We must get everyone off the planet before it dissolves completely ! Please , help us ! - How long do we have ? - [ rumbling ] [ Hunk ] Not long . How did this happen ? We 've known for years that our planet would eventually lose its outer layer . Like a snake shedding its skin ? Yeah , yeah , that doesn 't sound so bad . Beneath that old skin is a new , healthy layer , right ? Nope . No , I- - I think the next layer is acid . The plan was to evacuate the population to our nearest moon , where we have built a colony to wait out the shedding process . So we relocated to higher ground and constructed that ark . [ Lance ] What happened ? [ Baujal ] The Galra attacked , led by a vile commander named Morvok . He robbed us of vital resources and left us with only one operational engine , stranding us here . You 're not stranded anymore . We will save your people . I believe you , for I have heard many legends of the valor of Voltron . Five brave Paladins dedicated to this ... Wait , wait . I count only four of you . Are you not Voltron ? Uh ... almost ? Where is the fifth Paladin ? He 's not here , but we can still help you . I would feel more comfortable with all five Paladins . Duly noted . Pidge , Hunk , take a look at the ark and see what we 're dealing with . Piece of cake . We 'll get it flying in no time . - [ rumbling ] - [ gasps ] [ crackling ] Would you settle for upright ? [ beeping ] We 've been here for hours . Still no sign of Zarkon . Well , I 'm glad I don 't have to wait here alone . You understand , I could never live with myself if Zarkon was finding us because of me . I must know . We face such a dire threat from the Galra . Well , sure , they 're bad . No doubt about that . But at the same time , couldn 't at least a few of them be fighting for good ? Just look at Ulaz . He sacrificed himself to save us . For all we know , his sacrifice was a ploy . One life means nothing to Zarkon . It means something to me . It means some of them are actually willing to help . And we could use all the help we can get ! Any offer of help from the Galra is merely a prelude to a trap . I know all too well how quickly they turn . It just seems crazy to lump everyone together . Listen , if there are any good Galra , they have had 10,000 years to take down Zarkon . I would never count on them for help . [ crackling ] I have located them . Get me Morvok . Commander Morvok . Aaah ! Lord Zarkon ! I am sending you coordinates near your current location . Voltron is there . Find it and bring it to me . Voltron , sire ? Indeed . Have you received the coordinates ? If I may , I was able to acquire many resources , all to glorify your mighty reign , may it last a thousand centuries . Your bootlicking does not impress me , Morvok . I merely meant that I could be of even more use if I were to bring you these resources instead of ... [ Zarkon ] Are you refusing my order ? Of course not ! I will not fail you , Lord Zarkon . See that you don 't . Vrepit sa . Vrepit sa . [ Pidge ] Assuming we can get it back up , the repairs will still take time . [ Lance ] Which would appear to be the one thing we don 't have . We need to slow down the shedding . How do you stop a planet that 's coming apart at the seams ? By sewing it back together ! What do you mean ? That new Green Lion weapon causes vegetation to grow , right ? Well , I was thinking that if you aim it at the cracks in the planet ... the vines could act like stitches . But won 't the stitches get dissolved by the acid ? The stitches might hold longer if they 're frozen . It 's a plan . Hunk , you and I will take our lions and get this ark upright while Pidge and Lance buy us some time . [ cracking ] [ Hunk ] My side 's clear , Shiro . [ Shiro ] Almost done . Yes ! It worked ! It won 't hold forever . Keep going ! [ grunting ] [ Shiro ] Come on ! Give it all you got . That 's it ! We 're almost there . Thanks , guys . [ Lance ] You got it . [ Pidge ] Anytime . [ cheering ] [ Shiro ] All right , Hunk , time to work on those engines . [ Keith ] So , what happens if Zarkon does come after us ? You said you could pilot us to safety , right ? Sure , but after that , could we even go back to the group ? And if we don 't , who would pilot the Castle or create wormholes ? Well , what about you ? Without you , the team cannot form Voltron . Well , it ain 't pretty , but it should get you airborne- - [ rumbling ] Just in time . [ sputters and ignites ] What was that ? The Galra . They 're back . [ rumbling ] [ gasping and yelling ] [ Shiro ] Hunk ! Take the Yellow Lion and hold up the ark . If it falls into the acid , the Taujeerians are doomed . [ Hunk ] Not to mention the guy beneath them . Which would be me , in this particular scenario . Lance , Pidge , we 've got to draw the cruiser 's fire . Coran , we need you here now . Attack the Galra cruiser ! [ Coran ] I 'm on my way ! - [ Coran ] Keith , Allura , are you there ? - We 're here , Coran . What is it ? Zarkon is definitely not tracking us through either of you . - He 's not ? - How do you know ? Because you 're out there , and a Galra fleet just showed up here ! We need you now ! [ Allura ] We 'll be there in two doboshes . [ Keith ] Even faster than that . What is that ? It 's the booster fuel Pidge added to this pod . [ engines charging ] - Aaah ! - Aah ! [ both screaming ] [ panting ] Allura ! [ grunts ] Grab my hand ! - [ grunting ] - [ panting ] [ panting ] Princess , are you okay ? I believe so . Is your radio still working ? Let 's find out . Coran , can you hear me ? [ static on radio ] This is going far better than I anticipated . We could actually capture Voltron ! I could get transferred back to the hub . And they said I wasn 't good enough to be in the hub . [ gasps ] Maybe Zarkon will invite me to sit in his box at the gladiator matches ! The ultimate honor ! Sir ! Three Voltron Lions incoming ! [ Morvok ] Fire on them with our full arsenal ! - [ rumbling ] - Keep firing ! [ Galra soldier ] Sir , the lions are moving too fast for us to hit . Well , let 's make them stay in one place ! Train the ion cannon on the ark . Sink the entire thing into the acid ! [ beeping ] [ Shiro ] They 're aiming the ion cannon at the ark ! Lance ! Pidge ! Attack the ship with your jaw blades ! [ Keith ] We 'll never get there at this rate . This was a terrible mistake . Shiro was right . We never should have left them . [ rumbling ] [ grunting ] Rocks ! Big , big rocks ! [ Lance ] We got you , buddy . What happened ? [ Galra soldier ] The Black Lion attacked the cannon . He 's disabled our projectile guidance system . We won 't be able to aim the cannon until it 's fixed . Fix it ! Full attack ! Fire with everything we 've got ! [ whimpers ] Way to go , Coran ! Hunk , what 's your status ? Mostly just trying not to fall into a bubbling pot of acid . Divert all shields to the main hull ! Focus full firepower on their ship ! [ Lance ] We 're being overwhelmed ! [ Pidge ] We need Voltron ! Oh , if only there were another who could pilot the Red Lion . Finally , Alfor . I will walk in your footsteps ! Oh , Red Lion , I am unworthy to be your Paladin , but since you have chosen to bestow this honor upon me , Coran Hieronymus Wimbleton Smythe , I humbly accept . [ low growl ] Oh , yes ! Right . Okay . Just a quick lap . [ rocket booster fire ] Uh , okay , guys ? So , yeah ... the- - the Red Lion ran away . [ rumbling ] I can 't hold it any longer ! Hunk , you have to ! If you let go , the Taujeerians will die ! [ metal creaking ] [ grunting ] [ screams ] [ growls ] Oh , whoa ! Armor claws ! Guys , I can keep this thing from falling any farther but I need your help to get it back up . [ Shiro ] We 're on our way ! - [ Allura ] Keith , look ! - Huh ? The Red Lion found you ! [ low growl ] [ beeping ] Sir , the ion cannon 's guidance system is back online . And the lions appear to have gathered beneath the ark . Perfect ! The lions will go down with it . Fire when ready ! [ rapid beeping ] - [ cheering ] - All right ! Good to have you back , Keith . Good to be back . - Is the Princess with you ? - Yes . Like " with you " with you , or ... Uh , Keith ? Little help ? On my way , buddy . All right , everybody . No time to relax . Let 's show them what they 're dealing with . Form Voltron ! [ roaring ] Sir , our weapons systems are knocked out completely . Should we retreat ? Never ! Aim the ship at the ark ! We will take it down ourselves . To die for the Galra Empire is the greatest honor imaginable . Vrepit sa ! [ soldiers ] Vrepit sa ! Prepare my escape pod . [ Pidge ] They 're heading for the ark ! [ Hunk ] They 're gonna ram it ! We 'll have to meet them head-on . Form sword ! [ Lance ] Will the sword be able to cut through an entire battle cruiser ? [ Shiro ] It 'll have to ! Guys , I think my lion is telling me something . Yeah , mine too . - I can feel it too . - Same here . Then do it ! - Yes ! - Yeah ! [ Shiro ] Now let 's get the Taujeerians to safety . How are we going to do that ? Their booster rockets are shot . [ rumbling ] - [ thud ] - [ gasping ] I 'm so sorry for leaving . Me too . We thought we were doing the right thing . But clearly you were correct , Shiro . We are always stronger together . At least we learned that Zarkon isn 't tracking us through you two . Plus , I learned that my lion can grow armor and extend its claws like that ... Ting ! Which will come in handy if we ever needed to , say , I don 't know , slice up a giant steak while getting beat up . Or fight evil and save innocent people . That too . That would work . The fact that the Red Lion came to help Keith from so far away is a vital piece of information . We now have proof that a lion and a Paladin can , in fact , connect over a far greater distance than we realized . Which means we finally know how Zarkon is tracking us . It 's through the Black Lion .

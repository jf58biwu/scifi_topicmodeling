 [ suspenseful music playing ] All right , team , I 've got my eye on the targets . I 'll cover you from up he- - Hey , Keith , I had that guy ! They 're still coming ! [ laughs ] Well , that was awesome ! Pidge , could you maybe hurry it up a little ? - Almost ... - [ electronic beeping ] There ! [ powers down ] - Great job , Pidge . - That 's the last outpost in this quadrant . Call the Blade of Marmora . Let them know this base is cleared . [ Shiro ] I don 't know . The last thing I remember was Zarkon trying to overtake the Black Lion . It told me to use my bayard . Then , just nothing . I woke up , and I was back on a Galra ship . Well , you 'd just unlocked the Black Lion 's ability to teleport . Could it have teleported you ? Maybe it was trying to save you . By teleporting me into the hands of the Galra ? Maybe Zarkon forced it to . He was trying to control the Black Lion up until the very last moment , right ? Yeah , maybe . Well , if you 're feeling up to it , the rest of the team would be thrilled to see you up and around again . They need you , you know . Yeah , I 'll try . Okay , we 'll be on the bridge . - Hey , Keith ? - Yeah . How many times are you gonna have to save me before this is over ? As many times as it takes . Great job out there , everyone . You 've really turned the tide in this war . I 'm glad you never lost sight of the mission while I was gone . You 're looking better . How are you feeling ? Good . Just trying to get rid of this weird headache . [ Pidge ] Guys , I think I have something here ! So , I downloaded intel from the Galra base we just defeated . I untied the quantum-folded encryption , and I found something on Lotor . - Do you know where he is ? - Well , not exactly , no , but the last three sightings of his command ship have been in the Va 'Kar quadrant . Nice work , Pidge . Although , those quadrants are massive . How will we pinpoint his location ? Hey , that comet is made from the same material as Voltron . Maybe I can scan the emission spectrum for Fraunhofer lines , like when I found the Blue Lion ! But you know those emissions are subject to free induction decay . Those are exponential drop-offs . Yeah , but if you could find a way to amplify the sensors- - No , there 'd be way too much interference . What if , instead , we increase the SA magnitude ? The spires of the Castle ! Genius ! [ doors open ] I have no idea what either of them just said . Let 's set a course for the Va 'Kar quadrant while they get started on that detector . We need to work fast . Who knows what Lotor has planned for that comet ? - [ knocking on door ] - Yeah ? Hey , man . I just wanted to talk with you because ... Well , because I 've been worrying about something . Must really be bothering you if you 're coming to talk to me . Well , I mean , you 're the leader now , right ? - I guess . - I 've been doing some math . With Shiro back , that makes six paladins , but there are only five lions , and if I 'm right , that 's one paladin too many . Solid math . Look , when Shiro takes over the Black Lion , you 're going to want your Red Lion back . If I get a lion , I 'd have to take Blue from Allura . But she 's progressed a lot faster than any of us did . She might even be able to unlock powers we don 't know of . That 's true . So , maybe the best thing I can do for the team is step aside . What are you talking about ? This isn 't a participation game . This is war . And you want your best soldiers on the front lines . Stop worrying about who flies what and just focus on your missions . Things will work themselves out . Okay . Thanks . And , Lance ... leave the math to Pidge . [ humming ] Thanks for hooking me into the system . [ mouse squeaking ] I would 've never been able to reach back there . - [ mouse squeaking ] - Sorry , I know you got all dirty . I owe you guys a little mouse shower now , okay ? I 'm gonna get to work on that right after we find Lotor . Hey , can we fire this up and see if it works ? [ electronic beep ] [ electronic beep ] [ rapid electronic beeping ] Uh ... Maybe we didn 't adjust the polarity correctly . - [ grunts ] - [ whirring ] [ electronic beeping , dinging ] Uh , guys ! Guys , I found the comet , but it 's booking it away from us ! Coran ? Allura ? Can someone Altean come move this Castle ? [ Allura ] Well done . We 're on our way . [ electronic beeping ] Okay , we 're gaining on it . Make sure we stay far back enough to be undetected . [ electronic beeping ] Looks like the signal stopped in the Ulippa System . Activating long-range scanners . That 's not Lotor 's ship . - [ electronic beeping ] - But the comet is in there . - Okay , team , we need to get that- - - Here 's the plan , everyone . Oh , I 'm sorry . Go ahead , Shiro . We need to get that comet . They must be transporting it into that base . It 'll be vulnerable during the transfer . That 's the best time to strike . Who the heck are these guys ? I don 't think they 're moving the comet to that base . - We need more information . - You 're right . You take the Black Lion . I 'll stay with Coran in the Castle and provide support . Keith , are you sure ? I 'm sure . What 's wrong ? [ Lance ] Shiro , where are you ? We need you right now ! [ sighs ] Keith , I 'm gonna need you to lead this mission . [ Keith ] What ? What is it ? What 's wrong ? The Black Lion isn 't responding to me . It looks like you 're its true paladin now . I 'm coming down . [ grunts ] This may be the worst post in the Galra Empire . But it 's my post ! Victory or death ! The most important thing is for you to get eyes on that comet . Second is figuring out who we 're dealing with . [ banging on door ] [ banging continues ] You ! Lotor sent you to finish off what he started ? [ Keith ] Shiro , we 've just boarded the ship . There 's no crew in sight . Moving forward with the search . [ steady electronic beeping ] [ beeping continues ] [ rapid beeping ] This way . - Let me finish him off ! - No , you know the plan ! [ grunts ] My life doesn 't matter . All that matters is the empire ! - [ cat purring ] - [ indistinct whispering ] Shutting down security . [ powering down ] [ rapid beeping ] Sounds like the fight next door is over . Let 's hurry . Retracting roof . [ groans ] Coran , give me a closer look at that . Is that ... ? The teludav ! What , in the name of King Groggery the Infirm , is going on ? [ beeping continues ] - The comet should be in here . - [ rapid beeping ] Like , right here . Where 's the comet ? Is it in that ship ? [ Hunk ] I think the ship is the comet . No , it can 't be ! He 's already made a ship from the comet 's ore ? - Oh , this is bad . - More like horrible . [ Shiro ] Guys ... There 's a piece of the teludav inside the Galra base . The one we used to wormhole Zarkon 's ship ? But they would never be able to operate it without an Altean- - [ gasps ] Zarkon 's witch ! She had Altean markings . - Is anyone else kind of freaking out ? - Yep , mark me down for one freak-out . Lotor must be nearby . We need to find him and take him out for good . Team , you cannot let Lotor get that ship . You need to get back to your lions . You need Voltron ! Why take out one ship when we can stop all of this by taking out Lotor himself ? We can 't let him keep outsmarting us . That 's exactly why we can 't risk letting Lotor have that ship . This is too important . Keith , I want to stop Lotor just as badly as you , but Shiro has a point . Okay , you guys go back to the lions . I 'm gonna search the ship for Lotor . Keith , you need to stick together . - Yeah , I 'm with Shiro on this one . - As am I. - Me , too . - Yeah , man . Fine . Let 's move . [ panting ] [ gasps ] Huh ? [ growls , grunts ] Yah ! - [ screams ] - [ grunts ] - [ grunting ] - [ panting ] [ both grunting ] [ grunts , gasps ] [ grunting ] I got you , buddy ! [ both grunting ] - Huh ? - [ grunting ] [ screams , grunts ] [ grunting ] [ grunting ] Pidge , a little help ? [ both grunting ] [ sighs ] It 's been a long time since I 've faced a worthy opponent . I 'm going to enjoy crushing you . - [ gasps ] - [ grunts ] [ grunting ] We don 't have time for this . We need to get to the lions . Good idea . [ grunts ] Zethrid , stop ! Come on ! This is our chance to destroy them ! We have what we came for . Stick to the plan . Okay , seriously , what is going on ? I mean , who were they ? I 've met one of them before , in the weblum . - She stole some of the scaultrite . - Allura , you said they had an Altean ? They must be trying to build a teludav so they can make wormholes . If Lotor has turned the comet into a ship , we have much bigger concerns . I thought Lotor took over for Zarkon . Why is he attacking a Galra base ? I don 't know . That 's why we have to stop him here and now . [ grunts , sighs ] - We have to stop that cargo ship . - On it . That must be the ship made from the comet . Then let 's be careful . Raise particle barrier . Fire Castle defenses . A quick little bugger , isn 't it ? I 've never seen something that size move that fast . That blast cut right through the particle barrier ! Team , where are you ? [ grunts ] We can 't take another hit like that ! Form sword ! Keep Voltron engaged until the cargo ship is out of range . Do not be drawn in . The sword strike is his most deadly blow . [ growls ] It 's too quick ! Guys , the cargo ship is escaping with the teludav inside of it . I thought taking down the ship made from the comet was the most important thing . We still can 't let Lotor get away with the teludav . Shiro 's right . We need to destroy it . But the comet is right here ! We need to take it down ! Keith , the cargo ship is getting away ! We have them right where we want them . They can either defend or go after the teludav and leave themselves vulnerable . - [ Hunk ] Guys , the teludav 's getting away . - [ Lance ] Keith , what should we do ? You 're going to have to lower your shield , shoot the cargo ship , and deal with the consequences . We can beat this ship first , and then get the cargo ship . There 's not enough time ! - You need to make a decision ! - [ growls ] Hunk , get your bayard ready . On my cue , we 're gonna lower the shield and shoot the cargo ship . - Ready ? - [ paladins ] Ready ! They 're going to attack the cargo ship . Prepare to fire as soon as the shield goes down . Go ! Fire now ! - Fire again ! - [ grunts ] [ all screaming ] Your failure is most disappointing . Return before more Galra ships converge on your location . [ sighs ] [ grunts ] So , Lotor was attacking the Galra base and trying to steal the teludav ? None of this makes any sense . We can talk about this later . They 're getting away ! - We need to go after them . - No . Get back to the Castle . Something strange is going on here , and we need to figure it out . - I 'm sorry I had to step in back there . - I thought I had it under control . You need to learn to pick your battles . Sometimes , you have to make hard choices . - I 'm no good at this . - Yes , you are . It was your quick thinking that prevented Lotor from getting away with the teludav . You 're gonna get there . The Black Lion has chosen you . I 'm proud of you , Keith . I can 't remember anything , except that whoever it was had the correct landing codes . I swear ! You must believe me ! I believe you , but you still must pay for your failure . [ screaming ]

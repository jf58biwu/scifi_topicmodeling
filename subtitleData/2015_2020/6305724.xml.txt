 We 're clones , we 're like lab-rats in an illegal experiment . These were Rachel 's parents . Project LEDA . I mean , it 's total military speak . The military created us ? We 're sick . Your little girls are dying . Your attempts to make new clones should meet with failure . I want the key to your cipher . The Island of Dr Moreau . Professor Duncan gave it to me for a present . - For the embryos . - Those are my babies ? In nine months we 'll be welcoming a brand-new you into the world . My father is the father . I 'm carrying your babies . Did you burn down the fish people 's ranch ? No . Auntie Cosima . You 'll no longer be working with clones . Frankfurt . None of this is personal . If you let her die without me , it is personal . Kira gave her bone marrow to cure Cosima . Enjoy your oophorectomy . - Sarah will never forgive me . - You did what you had to . My name is Marian Bowles . I 'm from Topside . We steer the Dyad group . This is Project CASTOR . Oi , meathead , I don 't think those are gonna fit . They 're very little . Maybe you can wear them on your fingers . They 're not for her , silly . Helena 's gonna have a little monkey , too . Monkey number two . Felix , that ox liver smells fantastic . Doesn 't it ? It 's our sister 's favourite . Marinated in horilka all-day . Mmm . That 'll go perfectly with these . Are you gonna say " thank you " ? Thank you , sister Alison . Oh , heavens ! Just a few things I 've made . This is your special day , Helena . You and your precious cargo . Dude , you look awesome . You look awesome also , sister . - You are well ? - Oh , yeah . I 'm like way better thanks to science . Check it out . - Babka cake ? - Mmm-hmm . Kovbasa . Go ahead . Dig in . You 're eating for two now . Relax , Helena . You remember me , don 't you ? Yes . Pupok . It 's been a long time . You 're being tested again . This time you 're carrying a child . It 's called ... They took me from my sisters . No one said it was gonna be easy , kiddo . Ripped By mstoll Are there still fish in the water ? Yeah . Big , sleepy fish , because we never come to visit . Darling , why don 't you go take a stroll down the bend ? - See if you can find some fish . - Mmm-hmm . - Not too far . - Mmm-hmm . See if you can find the monkey fish . Okay . Well , it has been a while since we 've been - back to shite beach . - Mmm-hmm . I think it was your memorial . That was lovely . Vic spoke . Can we just enjoy this , please ? Enjoy military boy clones with scars all over their faces ? - Don 't pretend this is over , Sarah . - Marian 's handling it . Marian has already buggered off to Europe . To cover for us . She 's controlling Dyad . She 's the only reason I got out . Nothing is benevolent with these people , Sarah . You know it . We 've seen it time and again . Who 's that ? What did I tell. you , Sarah ? - Penny 's gonna drop . - Kira , come here . It 's Delphine . God , she looks good . Until three weeks ago we didn 't even know Project CASTOR existed . They were a myth . But now they 're a bomb , and shockwaves are coming . These guys aren 't my problem . I 'm sorry , they are . Rachel has powerful friends , and you put a pencil in her eye . Listen , please . There are threats to LEDA from outside and in . And , Marian , she sent me , yes , to protect Dyad , but to keep your sisters safe . - Right . - At any cost . Have you even talked to your girlfriend yet ? I need to show you how we caught him . Who is that ? You wanna ? Her name is Krystal Goderich . I don 't wanna see this shit . It gets worse . Another one . We intercepted them as they were forcing her into the trunk of a car . Now , Krystal was lucky she lived . But this one killed two members of the security tea m , - and the other one got away . - Why ? What are they after ? He hasn 't told us so much as his name . And now he says he will only talk with you . Well , here I am . You 're a legend , Sarah Manning . You got a name or a serial number or some shit I can call ya ? You 're made of the good stuff , aren 't you ? Krystal had no idea what she was made of . Found the whole concept very confusing . I never met her . No , but you met Alison and Cosima . And the rest , as they say at Dyad , is , uh ... What do you want with us ? The walls have ears . Come closer . I 'll. whisper it to you . I met one of your brothers , too . How do you know which one ? Yeah , I kicked him in the face . You think that 's funny ? He wasn 't a soldier , he was a Prolethean . Was he ? It 's hard to tell who 's who these days . I mean , what is the wild one doing with Dyad ? I 'm not with Dyad . Well , you 're trusting the wrong people . - I only trust my sisters . - Oh , I know . It 's a family affair . Felix and your stepmom , Mrs Sadler , and , of course , little Kira . A child . Hmm . How special you are . Don 't you talk about my family . You come near them , I will kill you . - Pull her out . - You piece of shit . Pull her out now . Sarah ? Count your sisters . I 'm fine , Sarah . Thank you for asking . But any boy clone who crosses the Hendrixes is gonna get his butt kicked . Girls , no bunching . What about you , Fe ? We 're doing fine . We 're just hanging out here with my new roomie , Cosima . Oh ! Fish sticks ! Ref ! Ref ! I 'm sorry , I have to go . I have to go , Sarah . Bye . Cosima 's temperature is down to normal by the way . She 's actually got a bit of colour in her cheeks . - And Helena ? Helena 's an albino . Tell Sarah that Helena hasn 't come back . - What ? - Is she talking to Delphine ? - Yeah . - Is she with Delphine ? Um , Cosima 's telling me to tell you Helena still hasn 't shown up . - Oh , shit ! - And I think her bag 's gone . I 've got a bad feeling about this . Well , what do you want us to do about it ? Um , meet me at S 's , yeah ? - Okay . Bye . - Yeah . Okay . Helena 's missing . No , no . You and I , we have other priorities . No , we don 't ! My priority is my sister , and you 're gonna see Cosima . I warned you about a threat from within . Topside is sending an investigator to Dyad to assess the security risk posed by you and your sisters . - That 's your problem . - No . It 's our problem . The man that is coming is a cleaner . He cannot find out what we did to Rachel , so you 're gonna have to play your part . What part ? You have to play Rachel . Oh , piss off ! - Sarah , please . - Delphine ... - We are in this together , please . - I am leaving , and you 're not stopping me , are ya ? Yeah . Okay . So , I 'm going to send you ... You sit at the very back , okay ? - Yoo-hoo ! - Hold you sister . - I 'll sit with her . - Alison ? - Hi . - Hi . - Okay . Up you go . - Driving the soccer stars bus ? Look at you helping out ! Hi , Marci . What can I do for you ? Well , don 't worry . I 'm not trying to list your house . It 's election time again , so can I count on your support for school trustee ? You 're the incumbent , I 'm pretty sure you 're safe , Marci . Honestly , Alison , I am so inspired by your recovery . You are still a community leader in Bailey Downs . And you know what ? Maybe in exchange for just a smidge of campaigning , I could help revive your monthly potluck . Urn ... I heard you plan to tinker electoral boundaries . Taking Bailey Downs out of the Glendale school district . Well , uh , that 's just one possibility , yes . That would mean my kids have to change schools . So instead of supporting you , I 've been thinking of running against you . Really ? - Yeah . - Wow . So best of luck to you . Okay , up you go . Everybody on . Let 's go . - What are you doing here ? - I finally did it , Ali . I finally told Susan Teller what was what . Oh , my God ! You got fired ? Oh , it was frickin ' glorious . I called her a bitch ... - Shh . - ... to her face . - Donnie , that 's enough . - What ? People are watching . Shush your mouth , and I will see you at home . Uh , they took the keys to the Taurus . Honey , they took my Taurus . - Dad , why are you here ? - Okay , inside . Inside , okay ? Good job , honey . Okay , everybody , hands in , windows up . On the bus , Donnie . - Get on the bus ! - Okay . Hi , everybody . You know my face ? Never had the pleasure . It 's not what I asked . Honestly , I don 't know you , son . Think hard . One of a kind . You 're a CASTOR ? Professor Ethan Duncan was here . Major Dierden agreed that Project CASTOR would leave me and mine out of this . I 'm not under Dierden 's orders . So , where 's Duncan now ? With Dyad ? Making a big entrance too late , Love . Duncan went into Dyad , he cared for it so little , he made himself dead . All. right . His research , where is it ? Well , it 's at Dyad , I assume . Not the sharpest knife in the box , are you ? The eye was lost . She 's sustained some trauma to the frontal lobe . It 's too early to predict an impairment . Topside is sending Ferdinand . He lands in three hours . Topside took action on LEDA before . There was an incident in 2006 . - Helsinki ? - Yes . Marian briefed me . I 'm here so it doesn 't happen again . I have talked to Sarah . She mustn 't uncover Helsinki . Not even Rachel knows . Can I count on you , Dr Nealon , to put LEDA above its individuals ? Neither of us can afford to play favourites now , can we ? No , we can 't . Can you hear us ? Two bloody boy clones in one day ! What the hell is it that they want all of a sudden ? Well , this one wanted Duncan , his research . I 'm sorry . Sarah , I made ... I made a wartime decision . It 's only a matter of time before you find out . What have you done ? It was the only way I could see to get you out of Dyad . Marian wanted CASTOR information and Paul wanted something in return . Helena ? It 's what I had to do at the time . What , betray my sister ? - Give her to them ? - For Kira . That 's not your bloody decision , S , is it ? Does Dyad know about this ? - Did Cal ? - No . It was Paul 's demand . I ... I had to choose . - Sarah , stop . - Don 't . Please . Don 't turn your back on me . Not on your people . You 're not my people . Great . Stick me in the middle with a bloody apple in my mouth . Please , go after her . Don 't Let her make it worse . Well , she 's gonna make it worse . She will . But right now , I need to get you to a hospital so I 'm calling Benjamin . This girl just fell on her face . - Ouch . - Like there 's a cliff and there 's barely any water at the bottom . Hey , can I ask you something ? Yeah . Do you , um , remember when you were waking me up to tell me to read that story to you ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? I was having this dream where I was , like , way above , and I could see below , and then I came back ... To you . Did you feel that thing ? I don 't know . Yeah . I don 't know , too . I don 't really have words for what I 'm trying to say . You had to come back so Delphine could make you better with my stem cells . Hello , Cosima ? It 's me . - Hey . - Hey . Oh , I am so happy you 're back . I only have a minute , so ... Oh , okay. just a minute ? You are not wearing your cannula . - Are you feeling okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Don 't , don 't ... Don 't mother me . What 's going on ? I 'm looking for Sarah . Is she ... Is she here ? Because she won 't answer my calls . - No . - I 'm sorry . This , um ... This Rachel problem is very ... Critical , so I need her help . You just talk to me . I am taking over some of Rachel 's duties , so I won 't be working with you and Scott for a while . So you 're the new Rachel . Awesome . Cosima , I am keeping my promise to love all of your sisters equally . But to do that , I can 't do this . Do you understand ? Okay . I get it . Mmm . Your minute 's up , you should probably just go . Look , we all have our part to play , me , Sarah , Alison , but yours is to cure . Yourself , and all. of your sisters . I Love you . Scott is going to come to do a check-up . Okay . Oh , my God . Well , I 've run the numbers . You can 't run from numbers , Donnie . We have one mortgage payment left . Well , we 're not taking from our retirement fund . Look , look , look . I 've got $ 347.82 in expenses from when I was a monitor , so that 's good . Plus , I am incredibly employable . But , you know , honey , I was thinking maybe you could work with your mom again part-time at Bubbles for a bit . I will dig ditches for this family , but I am not going back to work in my mother 's store . Besides , I have a bee in my bonnet . - I wanna run for school trustee . - You do ? Well , Marci Coates wants to change the district boundaries . I know . I heard she 's manipulating real estate prices . Yes ! Yeah , Marci 's gotta go . - Mmm-hmm . - For the kids . Yes . Oh , it 's Dyad . There was an emergency . Sarah 's up to her eyeballs . Is she okay ? Hello . Delphine . How could S do that to Helena ? I mean , who am I meant to call family now ? You can 't put them all under your wing . What should I do ? Should I abandon her ? Just like everyone else has done her entire Life . For you and Kira I 'd have done the same thing . I 'd have done the same thing that Siobhan did . Leave S out of it , please ? This is the other thing , Delphine . Delphine 's got your number ? Well , we definitely need new clone phones . She wants my help saving LEDA and Dyad . Jesus ! Don 't these people know you never even finished high school ? Piss off ! Maybe she can help me . Help you ? With what ? Help you with Helena ? Yeah . Please don 't . Please ? Hi , Delphine . I won 't condone this , Delphine , Rachel 's a stretch for her . It will be brief . Ferdinand knows Rachel , but it 's my meeting . You can just say hello and then excuse yourself . You have a cleaner named Ferdinand ? You don 't think I can do this ? Rachel Duncan , uber bitch . That was terrible . If you 're gonna do this , then you need to wear white . Okay ? White dazzles . God knows you 'll need distraction . Yea h , that 's good . The deal is , you 're gonna help me with Helena , yeah ? - Don 't say yes . - Yes . But let 's take it one step at a time . Well , ( ASTOR has her , so what are you gonna do about that ? Everything I can . But first , we need to get through this inquisition . Ferdinand can sense anything amiss . If we falter , he will smell it . Well , don 't falter , Delphine . Give us some space , I have to change . 96 over 60 . - Hey ! - So your blood pressure 's pretty good . - Yeah . - How 's your heart ? Oh , I am done with the French . Seriously , Cosima . With soldier clones running around and , you know , all this lesbian drama , uh , I don 't know that I wanna work on this super-secret shit any more . Oh , okay . Yeah , I get it . Um , but you might want to check this out . The Island of Dr Moreau . Yeah , it was gift from Professor Duncan . Dude , this could be his key to unlock the rest of the synthetic sequences . Mmm-hmm . Does Delphine know you have this ? I 've Learned from Dyad that secrets are power . And until you and I decipher it no one 's gonna know about it . Not even my sisters . Okay , hold . Welcome to the Dyad Institute . Enjoy your oophorectomy . Ferdinand ? Welcome . Delphine Cormier . Dr Cormier , yes . Rachel . Nice to see you again , Ferdinand . I 'm so sorry , I 'm between flights . I need you both . Please . In the light of the CASTOR revelation , Topside has engaged me to conduct a security review of Dyad . We understand . Marian has held a living , breathing CASTOR subject in her basement for three weeks . - Yes . - Without reporting it ? I believe she needed genetic confirmation . Like you , I 've only just been brought up to speed . Who else is aware ? Dr Nealon , Rachel , and myself . We are the only ones in the loop . Paul Dierden ? It appears he was a CASTOR mole . You let him get right next to you . He was her monitor . Dr Leekie put him there . You have consent over your monitors . I consented , yes , to Dr Leekie 's choice . There 's more . CASTOR has kidnapped Helena , Sarah Manning 's maternal twin . Is this true ? Yes . You 're holding Sarah Manning , correct ? - Yes . - I 'd like to question her . Is that really necessary ? It is ... Necessary . Whatever you need . After you , Rachel . Holy doodle ! Here we go . Oi , oi , Rachel . Shut up . Never gets old , does it ? Yea h , it does . Take it as a compliment , Miss Manning . You have a face to fight wars for . But when the wild seed blows back into the fold with something like CASTOR on our heels , I get suspicious . What 's CASTOR ? What 's that ? Sarah , this is very important . In all your unmonitored wanderings through our murky history ... - What ? - ... have you ever met a male clone ? - Answer the question . - No , no . Why , are you one ? No . Never met a soldier-boy , eh ? - No whisperings from Professor Duncan ? - No . No . I 've only met my sisters . - Sisters ? - Mmm-hmm . You really are the wild one , aren 't you ? Tell me , Rachel , 50 years from now you think your kind will still be calling each other " sister " ? I would hope we 'd just be another person in the checkout Line . Jolly good . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Ferdinand , please . Uh-uh-uh . What , what 's happening ? I thought you 're recovering from surgery . Oh , get your hands off me , you pig ! You watch your mouth ! Ferdinand , may we have a word ? We had to postpone the oophorectomy . Your goal is to isolate her fecundity ASAP . Why are you waiting ? I 'm not a doctor . You cannot remove the ovary of a woman who is ovulating . I know it is inconvenient , but she 's contained . No risk to Topside . Then remove her to her cell , please . I know you 're Lying . About flying anywhere tonight . Is that for my benefit or hers ? I wouldn 't attempt to pull the wool over your eyes , Ferdinand . I am surprised that your nemesis is still breathing . - Why did you let him do that ... - Shh . Not getting cold feet , are you ? Things are already in motion . Sarah 's biology is too unique to waste . So , by the way , is Helena 's . We need to locate her . We need to discuss Helsinki . Well , I want to discuss Helena . Then I 'll come to you , tonight . When I finish dinner , all. right ? I look forward to it . He 's doing it again . Guy thinks he 's the naked Buddha . I 'm doing my rounds . I 'll. be back . Look , don 't ... Don 't worry about me guys , okay ? Sarah , these people are dangerous . I thought Mr Rubber Gloves was gonna throttle me on the spot . I know , I 'm sorry . I just don 't believe that Helena is a priority for Delphine . We have to make our own moves . No , you 're right . We can 't rely on anybody but ourselves . We should go after her , the poor thing . No ! No , no , no . You tell Sarah I don 't want you doing anything like this ever again . I gotta go , Be careful , Sarah . Hey , I love you guys . Yeah , me too . Hello again . Hello , Rachel . I warned you this was personal . What day is it , huh ? What 's my name ? Come on . What ? What ... What happened to my ... Oh , come on . Come on , you can do better than that . - What 's my name ? - Stop ! Stop , Delphine ! There ! There we go . There you go . Good girl . Only , I 'm you now , you understand that ? I 'm you . And I will erase you completely , Rachel , unless you tell me what you 're planning with Ferdinand . - Ferdinand ... - Yeah . What have you got going on with him ? And don 't lie because I saw it . You ... You saw ... - You saw ? - Come on . Helsinki . Oh . You wicked sister . You 're not supposed to know about that . Now what else do you know ? Huh ? You 're gonna talk to me . You 're gonna talk to me ! - Drink ? - Same as last time . At the Crown bar . You 've come all this way , why not try some local colour ? Rachel . Rachel , Rachel . Why haven 't you been returning my calls ? Appearances , Ferdinand . Bourbon , rocks . So , the subject was Helena . You 're not yourself . Did you sleep with Paul Dierden ? He was my monitor , what do you think ? I think he was your bitch . Hello , again . Who 's a dirty clone ? You are . You 're avoiding Helena . I want you to consider a prisoner swap with CASTOR . It 's got nothing to do with CASTOR . This is about Helsinki . You wanted this ! Marian is too soft ! You said it yourself , if we didn 't act , your sisters could expose Topside . Helsinki 's the only option . - There are other options . - No , it 's too late . Be strong ! Helsinki girls were eradicated in 24 hours . Six clones , 32 collateral . As soon as you have Sarah 's ovaries , put her down . Induce Cosima tomorrow , and she 'll deteriorate rapidly . And Alison Hendrix ? It 's underway . Family chloroformed , followed by a house fire . Proven effective by the Finns ! Excuse me . I need a moment . Oh , my God . Pick up ! Hello , you 've reached Alison Hendrix . I 'm away from the phone , but leave a message and I 'll get back to you in a jiff . Alison , get out of your house ! Now ! Take the kids and get ... Who you talking to in here ? No one . What game are you playing , Rachel ? Hmm ? What are you up to ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Something is going on . If you 're not careful , Helsinki will swallow you too . Then you won 't get what you want . I want my sister spared . No ... You want the child , don 't you ? More than anything ? So , if you 're having second thoughts , remember Kira . Please . Poor , damaged Rachel . What happened to you ? Hmm ? Who 's behind that face ? You don 't recognise me , Ferdinand . No . Do you recognise me now ? Yes ! - Do you recognise me now ? - Yes ! Yes ! Pull it . Do you remember our safe word ? No ! Stop ! Come on , stop ! Come on . Get up . Go . - What is this ... - Shut up and stop squirming ! I ... I 'm sanctioned by Topside . To conduct a security review of self-aware clones , not screw our product ! Helsinki 's happening , Delphine . Won 't Marian be impressed ? Conspiring with one clone to murder the others . Now who will pay for this , hmm ? Her ? Topside 's favourite pet , or you , Ferdinand ? Because they will kill you . What do you want ? Marian will meet us in Zürich . You report to Topside that Dyad is secure . And self-aware LEDA clones an essential evolution of the programme . I know how leverage works . Good . Wait for me downstairs . Rachel ? Rachel was going to eliminate us . - Everybody we love . - Yes . - They 've done it before . - You should 've told me . I only did this for Helena . I know . I counted on it . You said you 'd help me find her . I already am . But until I figure out what CASTOR really is , you need to stand down . And don 't try anything else . I 'll be back . My legs hurt . Picture a box inside a box , inside a box . She 's been in almost 48 hours . All. right . In you go . Congratulations . You escaped the first box . I swear this guy 's from another world or something . Hello , brother . I 'm trying to figure out what these maniacs are after . She says they have the same tattoo . Both the LEDA and CASTOR originals are lost . Yet another mystery . Helena , I 'm very happy to meet you . I could beat her , Donnie . I could beat her like a French meringue . You have your orders . We 're gonna finish the job . Ripped By mstoll

 Previously on Defiance ... Congratulations . You found yourselves an honest-to-goodness Omec . When the Votan see you , all they see is a predator , because that 's all they know of you . The Omecs no longer consume the lesser races , but that is no concern of yours . I 'm here for my daughter . All right , here 's the deal . Our town needs gulanite badly . I suggest a sharing agreement , 50 / 50 . Our minds , your equipment . Everybody wins . You 're not a killer . You don 't know what it 's like , what killing does to you . I don 't want you to know . What happened ? My weapon jammed . - Who is it ? - It 's V.C. Patrol . Would you kill this human in exchange for your husband 's life ? No ! Family 's more important than anything else in this world , Alak . I am Christie 's mother . You can depend on me . I wish I could believe that . Pilar ? No , no , no , no , no , no ! Pilar ! Hey ! Hey , please ! She ... she took my son . You will spy for me as a team , both you and Stahma . I bet you 're thinking there must be a catch . Well ... Bebe ? Ah ! " The ship began crumbling " around them in a violent monsoon of terra-rock . " The Kaziri was in self-destruct mode . " Wounded , bleeding , " there was no way Nolan could make it out on his own . " So Irisa hoisted him over her shoulders . " As his hot , human blood mingled with hers , " she pulled the man she called Father to safety . " To freedom . To Defiance . " Oh , do you want that ? Here . No ! You know , my favorite part is the part where you carve up the E-Rep battalion and use them as a stepladder . I don 't care . It 's garbage . Nope . Uh-uh . Daddy 's reading . Hey , listen up , the stasis nets were down to let in a supply convoy , and a roller came in out of nowhere . They blew through the gates . V.C. markings . They 're headed straight for town . Vehicle approaching ! Fire on my command . Wait . Hold your fire ! What are you doing barreling in like that ? My husband 's in urgent need of medical attention . Please . I could have shot you . I stabbed the Liberata in the throat with my shiv , but he made enough noise to attract the guards . We had to run for it across open territory towards the vehicles . Bullets were tearing over our heads . It was a miracle that we made it to the roller . I pulled Stahma behind me , but Alak ... Alak was gone . We searched through the night , but when day came , we ... We had no choice but to leave . We can only pray to Rayetso that Alak and the baby can find their way home . Whoa there , Trigger . You 're going to open it back up . He 'll be fine . Thanks , Doc . I didn 't do it for you . Do you know where the camp is ? Somewhere in the Bordeen Valley . That 's half a day 's drive from Defiance . - How many troops they got ? - It was at least a hundred . They kept us both blindfolded . You were seen leaving town with Rafe McCawley . What are his whereabouts ? Rafe , Christie , and Quentin are dead . Those V.C. gwoninjos massacred an entire family . - All of them . - No . No , no . No ! Quite an arsenal . I 'm a big guy . I can carry a lot . Look , I know you 're hurting . Yeah ? Yeah . I 've known the McCawleys a long time . Rafe , he was my first friend here in Defiance , and I used to babysit Christie . But we can 't make this about them . Appreciate the advice . I need you to get intel . All right ? Troop movements , personnel counts , armament details , and then I need you to get your ass back here in one piece . Don 't worry about it . I don 't have to tell you we 're walking into a nest of stone-cold killers . So don 't . I need to know I can count on you . Don 't be stupid . Home at last . It doesn 't feel the same . Testing the tub for leaks ? Favis ... _ It 's all right , darling . Best to keep the plumbing active . If I may , did you find Alak ? We have . Is he all right ? For now . Andina , go prepare dinner . Why did you tell her Alak is alive ? She 's sworn to us . She can be trusted . We can 't trust anyone . If we 're caught , we will be executed for treason . Rahm Tak will kill Alak . Our grandchild will grow up an orphan . Shall I slit Andina 's throat ? Would that make you happy ? Andina ! You 're a child . Come in here , please . I 'm a professional criminal . I know who I can and cannot trust . - Yes , Favi ? - Get out ! We came to this town with nothing but the clothes on our backs . And I did whatever was necessary to provide for and to protect this family . And I will continue to do so , and I will do it without your input . Are you going to bathe on your own again , my dear , or are you gonna help me get into the gwoking tub ? Must be close . Rahm Tak 's calling card . Well , we better bury them . I 'll get a shovel . Nolan , watch out ! Hey , pal . Thirsty ? I got a flask of slam in the back of the truck . - You guys okay ? - For now . These woods are dangerous . Come on , we 'll take your roller to my cabin . Come with me if you want to live . Just making sure you made it up there okay . Of course . Did you make sure the transmitter is well hidden ? Naturally . Remember , it needs to be unimpeded from the north . And don 't forget to tell them that Nolan is heading in their direction . You take care of your end , I 'll take care of mine . Yeah . _ Is that my dad 's ? Used to be . This just came in . Guess what , Alak . Defying my very low expectations , your parents have successfully established a communication link . They 've also warned me that the Defiance town lawkeeper is headed this way . Tell me about him . You know , I never actually met him . I 've ... I 've always just tried to stay out of trouble . You 're an odd mutt . I mean , I see some of the noble refinement of Shanje Liro in the strong jawline , the bridge of the nose . But I also see the blunt arrogance of your father 's Yuke Liro . You are a sorry combination of qualities . Now , I 'll afford you that one mistake . Let 's start again . Tell me about the lawkeeper . His name 's Joshua Nolan . Joshua Nolan ? The Butcher of Yosemite ? Yeah . Yeah . He 's the scariest killer on the face of this earth , and he 's going to rip your jekking throat out when he gets here ! I was in Yosemite . There was a lovely waterfall . It ran red with Votan blood for days after Joshua Nolan massacred my comrades . It 'll be good to see him again . So what are a couple of arkhunters doing at the ass end of Oklahoma ? Looking for the camp those soldiers came from . You 're looking for the V.C. ? - Mm-hmm . - You got a death wish ? I 'm a thrill-seeker from way back . What do you know ? The Collective is bivouacked near Pallahas Ridge . There are blackberry bushes there , so I take my chances . Funny what you 'll risk your life for . - I could show you the way . - Appreciate that . Your baby 's awake . Hi . I found him in Freeman , Kansas , a couple of months ago . The V.C. had swept through . Killed every man , woman , and child . But they missed this little sucker . He 's a survivor . Cold , hungry , never makes a fuss . What 's his name ? I call him Bear , because he hibernates just like one . Well , this is no place for an infant . We 'll drop you two back in civilization on our way through . Where are you headed ? East . Defiance . Defiance ? I always wanted to visit , see that big arch . Count me in . Someplace warm , enough pow milk for my little Bear , I 'd ride strapped to the hood if I had to . No need for that . We 'll leave at first light . Here , just in case . I won 't let you down . Oh , the badge suits you well . What are you doing ? I 'm here to retrieve some personal effects from my roller . You stole that roller from the V.C. , who stole it from the E-Rep . So it 's spoils of war , and it belongs to this town , just like these weapons . That 's why I chose this particular vehicle . Prior to our escape , I saw soldiers loading the secret compartment . Let me be frank with you . My criminal interests have fallen to shtak in my long absence . Now , these weapons will help me reestablish supremacy . Look , I 'm sorry for everything that you 've been through , but if we are attacked by the V.C. , we need every gun , rifle , and slingshot we have at our disposal . _ Do you know what that means ? Your accent is a little thick for these human ears . The night of the mass killings at Camp Reverie , you were about to be executed . I saved your life . You can repay me now . All I 'm asking from you is to look the other way . Excuse me . I 'm sorry , but I can 't do that . Good day , Deputy . Datak . Stop . You wouldn 't shoot a cripple in the back , would you ? Yes , I would . You 're too honorable for that , sweetie . Final warning . It rarely ends well for people who order me around . Oh , I 'm devastated . I always felt a certain internal chemistry with you . Shut up . The ridge is a couple of klicks north . There 's a back road , but it 's kind of overgrown . Hard to navigate unless you know it . Might be better if I drive . Hand me the tags . Transmission 's all but shot . Hard to get it out of second gear . I 'm actually a very good driver . It 's okay . I got it . I 'll ask one more time . You want my roller tags ? You 're going to have to kill me . That thing needs an actuator to fire . Give it to me . Rafe McCawley 's boots . Half-Casti baby . Doesn 't take an Indogene to figure out who you are . It 's a pleasure to meet you , Pilar . That baby is the only thing I have left in my family . Please let me hold the child . What , the child you kidnapped ? That child ? The child I saved . I 'm not a criminal . You just tried to kill me and steal my roller . Only because I didn 't trust you . And you didn 't trust me either , or you wouldn 't have given me a disabled weapon . Let 's call it even ! Hey , it 's okay . Oh , please don 't cuff me . The Votan priests cuffed me , and they did terrible things . I just ... the baby needs ... Come here ! One more word , one more , I 'm going to stuff a sock in your mouth . We 're going to take you both back to Defiance . We 'll sort it out there . Until then , settle down and relax . Oh ! - No ! No ! - Let me have him . - Let me hold him ! - Hey ! Don 't kill her . Don 't kill her . I wasn 't planning to . All right , we 'll be back for you . Come on , let 's go . Whoa . What are you doing ? We can 't leave a baby . Why not ? - He 's happy . - He 's a baby . So ? Where 's he gonna go ? He 's a baby . You are very demanding . Hello , Datak . Amanda . When I was driving towards Defiance and I saw the glorious arch on the horizon , I thought it meant sanctuary . I was finally home . None of the many injuries you see on my body hurt more than the shabby treatment I received at the hands of your pretty little lawkeeper . Sarcasm . You 're such a pro , Amanda . You have anything else you want to get off your chest ? I paid dearly for those guns . I 've been tortured , humiliated . My son is likely dead . I have earned those weapons . We have an armory full of weapons . You really think those guns are why I kept you locked up all night ? Then why ? Oh . You 're still angry about your sister . Every day you 've been away , I 've been waiting to hear news that either you or Stahma , preferably both , had been killed in the Badlands . In my best daydreams , your deaths were very slow and very painful . But now you 're back . And I have a choice . I can either focus on making you pay for Kenya , or we can move forward . If you assure me that you will put Defiance first , if you swear to get the criminal element organized and fighting for the common good , if you promise to never cross me or make me regret this decision ... _ Say it in English . I promise . - You good ? - Let him out . Given our new understanding , those weapons would be very helpful . Not going to happen . Those weapons are going to stay locked up safe in the town armory to help us win the war . _ - You are young to speak Omec . - I 'm hardly fluent . In school , we studied your classics . The poems of Lutenn were my favorite . _ _ A recitation worthy of high marks . As your slave courtesans before fenuvano , was it not expected of Castithan women to recite your poetry ? Yes . That was a dark chapter in our history . Thankfully , we have matured . Evolved . Others have refused to move on . They are wary of us . But you , you are not . Perhaps I should be wary . In the bedtime stories of my childhood , the Omec were known as furije nefkitso . As legend has it , if a girl was ever to cross paths with an Omec , she would fall madly in love and be swept away in the Dread Harvest , never to be seen again . But that 's just the stuff of fairy tales , is it not ? One can never be sure . I am Eksu Tsuroz T 'evgin . What may I call you ? Stahma . What have you purchased there , Stahma ? Pain-relieving herbs . For my husband . Perhaps you can help me with a purchase of my own . I 'm looking for this thing they call sugar bread . The humans enjoy it . But ... But what ? As a connoisseur of the flesh , I would think an Omec would prefer something a little more savory . I remember that feeling , when the arks finally left Casti orbit . Relief . Reassurance that we would not perish by the heat of our own sun . And hope for a new beginning . My people shared that same hope . It did not last long . What happened to the Omec ships ? They were sabotaged . Our leadership told us that your vessels had a design flaw . Your leadership lied . The Votanis Collective sent saboteurs , Indogene shape-takers , on a suicide mission . The Votans feared that the Omecs would steal this paradise , this earth , out from under them . They set bombs , destroying our ships from within . But you survived . My ship , the Tsuroz , was lucky . When the explosion happened , my daughter and I were on a space walk . Our vacuum suits protected us . We were able to repair the hull . The others on the ship , however , died from exposure . Oh , Rayetso . I am sorry . So you and your daughter , you 're the only survivors of your entire race ? I don 't know . Once my ship is fueled and repaired , I will return to space . If there are any survivors , I will find them , whatever it takes . And you do not seek vengeance against the Votan people ? Vengeance is a luxury I can ill afford . My primary concern is to obtain gulanite , fuel my ship , repair it , and rebuild my race . I once despised the humans . Pink-faced aliens who treated us like animals . Put us in camps , where we went hungry , fell ill . But now you eat and drink beside them like nothing has happened . Why ? I fell in love with one . ♪ Must be heaven ♪ Perhaps there is much to learn about these humans . I could offer you guidance . Lessons in their culture . ♪ I saw the evil ♪ They got over a hundred men . 16 vehicles . Even got themselves some Volge . Oh , no . What is it ? They got a net-cutter . Long-range Vo-Tech artillery . Built to blast through stasis nets . All right . Let 's go . We need to warn Amanda . We need to blow it up . This is a recon mission . Used to be . There 's six grenades in there . I 'll get down to the camp , plant them on the tank . You cover me with this . - I should go . - Why ? Because if anyone sees a human , they 'll instantly sound the alarm . I 'll blend in better . It 's got nothing to do with this ? Firing a weapon ? You 're a better shot . I 'm a faster runner . Nice and easy , kiddo . Shh . Can I help you ? Zip it , munchkin . Back to sleep , okay ? Nighty night . All right . That 's it , kiddo . Let 's get it done . Hargyi ! Intruder ! Hargyi , hargyi ! Hey , hey , hey . What 's happening ? Hey , what 's happening ? Stay where you are . You think I 'm afraid of you ? Back off . You 're not gonna shoot that poor child 's grandmother . Not right in front of him . Kids are surprisingly resilient . Joshua Nolan ! Irisa . Where are you ? Sending a child to do the dangerous work ? Not much of a butcher , are you ? You 're a pork chop ! Come out of hiding , or I will show you who the real butcher is . I am the Butcher of ... where are we ? Tulsa , sir . I am the Butcher of Tulsa ! Go on , do it . I have no regrets . Come on , kiddo . What are you waiting for ? Kill him . Second thoughts ? I have to admit , I 'm surprised . Come on . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . Mississippi two-step . Okay . How did you miss the car ? ♪ Hey , Joe ♪ ♪ Where you going ♪ ♪ With that gun in your hand ? ♪ ♪ Hey , Joe ♪ ♪ I said , where you going ♪ ♪ With that gun in your hand ? ♪ ♪ I 'm going down to shoot my old lady ♪ ♪ You know I caught her messing round ♪ ♪ With another man ♪ ♪ I 'm going down to shoot my old lady ♪ ♪ You know I caught her messing round ♪ ♪ With another man ♪ ♪ And that ain 't too cool ♪ You shouldn 't have given them Bear . They 're his grandparents . So is Pilar . You think she 's dead ? Can 't be 100 % sure . But even if she is still roaming around out there , the baby 's safe . That is , until Rahm Tak gets here . No , no . Don 't . You had him . The leader of the assault . And if you hadn 't have choked , Rahm Tak would be a cooling corpse right now , and Defiance would be a whole lot safer . We 're at war , kiddo , and you 've become an unreliable partner . Joshua Nolan ... What ? Favi , we received a message from Datak and Stahma . Good news , I hope . They were successful in planting the shrill-infested weapons in the local armory . The town 's entire gun supply was destroyed . Not good enough . I want Joshua Nolan to know he can 't get away so easily . I want to make sure that Butcher and his shtake little town never forget who I am . Let 's shake them up a little bit . What does it say ? What ? What is it ? What does that mad man want ? He wants us to blow up the St. Louis arch .

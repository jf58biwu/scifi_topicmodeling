 - Previously on stitchers ... - Maggie : Why did your father kill himself ? - He didn 't . And he wasn 't my father . - My name is maggie baptiste , And i 'm working on a project that needs Someone with your particular aptitude . Welcome to the stitchers program . Has anyone ever done this before ? Her name 's marta . She couldn 't handle it . We work for a secret government agency That hacks into the brains of corpses and reads their memories . Get out of here before i tase both of you . Polygraphs don 't work on me . I fail them . Because of this condition of yours . I know you don 't get relationships , like , at all . What 's your problem that makes it that you don 't have any friends ? - Whose bed did i just wake up in ? - Mine . We 've been asked to look into the death of a research scientist . He and his partner developed the stitchers technology . His name was ed clark . - Who was his partner ? - Your father . Why weren 't you and your father close ? You 're the detective . Detect . I 'm in . - ( rock music playing ) - ( distant siren wailing ) ¶ o cadillac car ¶ Where 's my stuff ? I thought you were kicking me out . Yeah , you know , About that- - i was just mad . I put it all back into your room . Did you put everything back where you got it ? Don 't be ridiculous . So , tell me , Did you guys stop the bomber ? Yeah , basically we prevented u.C. Santa monica 's library From being turned into a crater . Shut up . I can 't believe you get the dead to tell you stuff . - When do you do it again ? - Tomorrow . Uh , what- - what are you doing ? I feel bad about ... Just how i acted before , Accusing you of screwing up my project And getting you put on academic suspension . So i went ahead and cooked us A let 's-be-friends dinner . I 'm trying to say i 'm sorry . So this is what " sorry " looks like ? Yeah . Seriously ? Okay . And this is what " pissed off " looks like . I want it on the record that i 'm stitching you in under protest . - You keep records ? - Of course not . It 's an expression . Comm links . We still don 't know what happened to you last time you got stitched . I touched something . I saw stuff . - What 's the big deal ? - Yeah , stitch happens . ( snickers ) Okay , that never gets old . Right . You 're not supposed to be able to touch anything . You 're in someone else 's memory . It 's an intangible . Oh , i 'm sorry . - Did i break your super-secret technology ? - Maybe . You should have seen the monitors in the lab that day . They were going goofy all at the same time . - Goofy ? - Goofy , zany- - who cares ? What i need to be able to understand is how you were able to make Physical contact with an intangible memory object And why it put our computers ' panties in a twist . Panties in a twist ? Is that the actual terminology Or just another expression ? That 's actual terminology we use . We 're men of science . How much time do we have ? The sample 's brain will degrade beyond viability in less than 48 hours . The sample has a name- - ed clark . Right . Sorry . Kirsten , i just want you to be safe . You think that Because of what happened to the other stitcher- - - Marta . - Right , marta . You think that what happened to her could happen to me ? I don 't know . Okay . Well , until you do , i 'm going in . Look , i didn 't connect with ed much , but he did raise me . I need to find out how he died , for real . I owe him that at least . You sure you 're ready for what you might see in there ? Let 's find out . Cameron : Stations , everyone . Lights to 20 % , please . Mission clock is set to five minutes . I 'd like a go , no-go for stitch neurosync . ( electric hum ) What the hell ? Ed can wait . Something 's come up . ( theme music playing ) ¶ take me inside ¶ ¶ take me inside ¶ Lisa keller , age 18 . Died last night At a rave in hollywood from a drug overdose . What was the drug ? It 's called burundanga . It comes from colombia . It 's affectionately known as " the devil 's breath " - - Basically the scariest drug on the planet . Linus . At low dosages the drug acts as a disinhibitor . It makes you do things that you normally wouldn 't do . But at high doses , the drug causes disorientation , Hallucinations , convulsions and , ultimately , death . You stopped me from stitching into ed 's memory For a drug investigation ? I 'm sorry , is keeping a horrific drug Off the street not worthy of your time ? Ed 's down to less than two days before his memories degrade . This girl 's memories have twice as long . Do the math . This drug is new to l.A. If it hits the street in quantity , We 're looking at hundreds of kids dead or dying . You see , i did do the math . You got me to be part of this morbid confederation of yours By telling me i would get the chance To find out how ed really died- - murder or suicide . And as long as there is time remaining , you will , But after we find out where lisa got the drugs . Fine . Well , are we gonna do this ? Date of birth- - 13 june , 1991 . No driver 's license , due to a medical condition of some kind . Mother , dead . Father , unknown whereabouts . There are big holes in her personal history . Your point , fisher ? There 's something not right with kirsten clark . The guy that everyone assumes is her father , who she 's not close to , Is actually just a family friend who raised her . And can you tell me why she has the protection Of some subdivision of a subdivision of the n.S.A. ? Let 's say- - and this is a big let 's-say- - You 're right . You know what my advice would be ? Let it go . Whatever your kirsten clark 's up to , It isn 't l.A.P.D. And , for sure , it isn 't you . - Captain-- - lisa keller . O.D. ' ed at a rave last night in hollywood . Open the investigation . Her mother is a judge , so button this one down . The kirsten clark thing- - Let it go . This is detective quincy fisher , robbery / homicide . How soon can i get the toxicology report On that hollywood o.D. From last night ? Yes , lisa keller . What do you mean , you can 't find her body ? I know it sounds like a big deal , but it 's not . You can 't find a body . How is that not a big deal ? This is los angeles . We get a lot of bodies in and out of here . It happens . You never lose your car keys ? You did not just make that comparison , did you ? Definitely not lisa keller . Nope . Did you file a report ? Look , detective , you 're new here , And i get that you want to do things right . Just give me a day or two to figure out where the breakdown is . I 'll find your lisa keller . Trust me , wherever she is right now , She doesn 't care . I 'm gonna go interview the rave promoter . I 'll be back in a few hours . Find her body . Will do . ( door opens , closes ) We may have a problem . Sample is online . She 's so young . Let 's get this done . The sooner we do this , The sooner i get into ed . That 's all . Cameron : Stations , please . Lights to 20 % , please . Atomic batteries to power . Turbines to speed . Mission clock is set . I need a go , no-go for stitch neurosync . - Life-sci ? - We are a go . - Sub-bio ? - Go . - Engineering ? - Go . - Communications ? - Yeah , we 're a go . - Medical ? - Go . Comm check . One , two , one , two . - Can you hear me , tough guy ? - Yes , i hear you . Okay , we 've mapped lisa 's memories as best we can . As best we can ? Is there a more accomplished team i should be working with ? She was on drugs . It 's unclear How that affects memory mapping . - Should i be worried ? - I 'm not sure , But you 'll tell me in three , two , one . Induce stitch neurosync ! - ( loud dance music playing ) - ( distorted shouting ) ( distorted ) whoa . Cameron : You okay ? What do you see ? ( shouting ) there are a lot of people here ! ( comms squeal ) Let 's- - let 's use our indoor voices , boomer . You 're the only one that can hear the music . Okay , got it . Explore your environment . Look around . I can 't- - I can 't really focus my eyes . I feel really odd . It 's the memory of the drug kicking in . Okay , lisa 's memory is being overtaken by the drugs . Okay , so put me back further . No can do . I can 't map earlier than a few minutes before she took it . Okay , the drugs are affecting our ability to navigate the memory . - Do you want us to bounce you ? - No . No , no , i have to get this done . I see a guy . He looks like he 's in charge . There 's a girl here . I feel that lisa knows her . Her name is denise . Lisa is- - Lisa is trying to get this girl to leave with her . What ? ( distorted dialog ) - ( growls ) - ( gasps ) - ( computers beeping ) - man : Condition unstable . Ayo : She 's getting into trouble . Heart rate 133 , cerebral temp 102.2 . - Linus , can we still bounce her ? - No . We passed the two-minute threshold 18 seconds ago . Okay , sporto , i 'll give you a shiny penny If you can get your vitals down . - I 'm- - i 'm bouncing . - Remember ... Yes , i know . First name- - kirsten . Exit pin code- - - Iheartlinus . - I am so changing that . ( gasps ) Well ? Lisa didn 't o.D. , At least not accidentally . She was murdered . I 've been through the police records . None of lisa 's friends were out with her last night . Kirsten : What about denise ? I searched all of lisa 's social media . She doesn 't have any friends by that name . No , it wasn 't friendship that i felt . It was ... Protection . Lisa was trying to save denise from something . And that 's what got her killed ? B-t-dubs , after lisa was forced to take the drugs , Your heart rate and respiration Were jumping around like they were booty poppin ' . Yeah , the drugs , um ... They turned everyone into monsters . Let me stitch into ed . That 's not going to happen Until we conclude this investigation . There 's nothing else to see . The drugs distorted everything , And these teen titans don 't have one good idea between the two of them . Okay , that is so not true . I was thinking about ordering a pizza . Let me stitch back into lisa then . I 'll stick it out longer , see if i missed anything . You have to wait until after the absolute refractory period . - What ? - The absolute refractory period . It 's the time needed between stitches To allow the sample 's neurons to reset . It has to do with the potassium transfer rate between cells . Just buy me a drink sometime , and i 'll tell you all about it . It 's true . He gets a few drinks in him , And that 's all he ever talks about . How long is the absolute refractory period ? Between five and , what , 12 hours . Each sample and stitch is different . Okay , so stitch me into ed while we 're waiting . The equipment can only be tuned to one person at a time . We don 't have time to switch lisa for ed . Wait out the refractory period . You 'll stitch lisa again , and then afterwards We will talk about ed . Is it okay if i go home and rest ? The stitch made me pretty tired . Absolutely . You need a ride ? Yeah . That 's so nice of you . Linus , while we 're gone , run the numbers . See if we can come up with any code To cancel out the effect of the drugs on the memory . Now i 'm definitely ordering a pizza . Hey , would it be okay if we made a quick stop on the way to my house ? Yeah . ( rock music playing ) ¶ loves , loves , loves , loves you little people ¶ ¶ keep burning in the sun ¶ Wait , where are we ? - This is where the rave was . - The r ... Hey , hold up . Kirsten , wait , hold . Wait . Hey . Hey , look . You lied to me , okay ? We 're on the same team , and you lied to me . We have to trust each other . That 's the only way - We 're going to be able to work together . - You done ? Allow me to make a few clarifying statements . We 're not teammates . We 're not coworkers . I 'm doing this for the sole purpose of getting the chance To learn what really happened to ed , And then i 'm done with you and maggie And your whole freak show . Well , that definitely is clarifying . Look , i 'm- - I 'm sorry about the freak show comment . But let 's be logical about this . We want to get the drugs off the streets , yes ? Lisa 's memories were distorted . Maybe being in the actual place where she died Will help me remember more clearly the things that i saw . Okay . But we keep a low profile and , by grabthar 's hammer , Please try not to piss anyone off ... Like you usually do . Man : I 'm not interested in whatever edgy new beats You think are gonna set the scene on fire . You want to play that garbage out here ? Go start a record label . Anything look familiar ? Yeah , that douchebag over there . ( muttering ) no . Damn , Damn , damn , damnedy , damn , damn . Tickets don 't go on sale till 9 : 00 . Who killed lisa keller ? I don 't know . Drugs , according to the newspaper . And who gave her the drugs ? I don 't know . And you know how you know i 'm telling the truth ? Because i 'm running a business , And dead kids- - they don 't pay to come to raves . Really ? That 's where you went with that ? What about the guy with the camera , Taking pictures ? Maybe he saw something . That would be raff . He 's my official unofficial photographer , But i wouldn 't bother him . Raff isn 't nice ... Like cleaver here . We 're not afraid of you . ( growls ) I don 't know why you 're so mad . We know more now than we did before . Yep , we know that when i 'm confronted by a bouncer named cleaver , i leak urine . Okay , how do i do this ? Say i 'm sorry ? We shake hands ? Oh , you really don 't know how to apologize , do you ? No , it 's not really one of my skills . Oh , maggie 's gonna kill us . Okay , man up , stud . Maggie needs us more than we need maggie . Man down , buttercup . I mean , she can actually kill us . She 's a former c.I.A. Assassin . Oh , i suppose this was not to be unexpected . Miss clark . - Nerdy guy . - It 's cameron . What are you two doing here ? I 'm afraid that 's above your pay grade , detective . Don 't tell me : A secret agency mission , right ? Well , if we told you , It wouldn 't be a secret , would it ? The name lisa keller mean anything to either of you ? Fisher , do you play chess ? - No . - Well , i do . Queen takes knight . I 'm a " settlers of catan " man myself . So what exactly do we know now That we didn 't know before ? The name raff ? - Yes . - Okay , that 's not even a real name . How are we supposed to find this guy ? We have no idea who he is . But we know where he 's gonna be . - Take me home . - Like , for reals ? Or are you gonna make me take you someplace awful ? For real ... Then i 'll make you take me someplace awful . ( rock music playing ) ¶ back to the start ¶ ¶ out by the sea ¶ I don 't know what the big deal is . You can totally do this . I told you ... I don 't rave . - Tonight you do . - Camille : Rave ? - We 're going to a rave ? - Cameron and i are going . Well , i 'm so coming with , unless it 's a date . Both : It 's not . And you 're not . It 's official business . So what ? It 's a rave . The agency doesn 't control the entire l.A. Dance scene . Do they ? Oh my god , come on . You guys need me there . Have either of you ever been to one of these before ? That 's what i thought . I 'll help translate From " rave " to " noob " for you . It 'd make sense to have someone there who knows what to look for . - Yes ! - Okay , fine . But i 'm not going in there without a wingman . Camille : Good . Find me someone exotic . Hey , buddy . Hey , good news : I think i 've figured out the drug-filtering algorithm . I 'm just running some simulations right now . That 's great . I 've got another mission for you . We are going To a rave tonight . ( snickers ) you go to raves ? ( whispering ) of course not . But tonight i do , and so do you . That 's- - that 's awesome . I haven 't been dancing in such a long time . I didn 't know you dance . Dude , there 's a lot about me you do not know . ( whispers ) why are we whispering ? Whispering ? I wasn 't aware of any whispering . Good . How long before we can stitch into the sample again ? Approximately five hours . Then i can expect to see everyone here In four hours and 59 minutes . Mm-hmm . ( whispers ) we 'd better get dancing . ( rock music playing ) ¶ it 's funny , but oh , it 's dangerous ¶ ( door opens ) Oh my god . You are more clueless than i feared . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing ... If you 're going to an accounting convention . How am i supposed to be dressed ? Not like a real estate agent , okay ? Come on . Come on . ( dance music playing ) ( chattering ) Yeah , thanks . - You want one of these ? - That is all you , rainbow bright . Okay . There they are . Woof ! Promise me you 'll never say that again . Whoa , kirsten cleans up good . - Is that the roommate ? - Camille . Yeah . Kirsten , you look- - - Ooh , steady , lab rat . - I was gonna say " nice . " Camille , this is linus . Woof ! Seriously ? - Shall we dance ? - You lead , i 'll follow , baby . ( dance music playing ) Okay , okay , listen . We 'll cover more ground if we split up in pairs . Buddies . - So it 's us . - Guess so . - Buddies ? - Or ... Something . - I 'll let you know when i spot raff . - Right . You- - you ever been to a rave before ? No , but i feel like i have . Yeah , you dance nice . - What ? - I said you dance nice ! - Oh , i take zumba . - What ? Zumba ! Okay . So who are we looking for , anyway ? I have no clue ! Okay , you look like a cop . What ? You gotta blend in . Dance ! I said i don 't rave , never said i don 't dance . What are you doing ? Helping a sister out . Come on . ( laughs ) Hey . Oh . Oh . Okay . Not bad . You 're a fast learner . - There we go . - Thank you . There she is . It 's denise . - ( cheering ) - ( dance music playing ) - You 're denise . - Who are you ? We 're friends of lisa keller 's . I saw her die . I know . I was there . Where is that ass-hat raff ? I think we found him . Why are you talking to my girlfriend ? In truth , i never said a word to her . Right ? Well , before that one . ( distorted speech ) We 're gonna get you out of here . Hey , who told you where to find us ? Lisa , this morning . Let me handle this . You a ... " settlers of catan " man ? More or a " risk " guy , i see . - Seriously ? - Okay , he had a knife . Do you have a death wish ? Whoa . Hey , yo , we 're dancing here . Oh , that 's them . Remember me ? Excuse me . Excuse me . I know you 'll remember me . Both : Woof ! She has a taser ? Damn it . Okay , let 's split up . You two search the back half of the parking lot . Cameron and i will look for them around the front . - Look for who ? - Not now , fisher . - Stop . - I have to go . I have to save her . I said stop . - Cameron : Kirsten . - Camille : Kirsten , stop now . All of you , face down on the ground , now . Come on , man . This is my best kurta . Now . You play football , miss clark ? I do . Touchdown . We 're investigating the death of lisa keller . - Please stop talking . - She didn 't o.D. She was murdered . And how do you know this ? Because we hacked into her brain after she died - And read her memories . It 's called " stitching . " - ( both groan ) Is there anyone in los angeles you haven 't told about us ? All of you , up . I can prove it . You gotta be freakin ' kidding me . You gotta be freakin kidding me . What the hell is going on ? Maggie , you remember detective fisher , don 't you ? Who authorized this ? Well , if it makes a difference , i was going to arrest them , Until kirsten offered to bring me here . It doesn 't make a difference . Well , i think we 've established That you can 't stop us from doing fieldwork , So i figured it would be helpful To have someone from the l.A.P.D. On the team . Figuring out stuff is not your job , And you were under strict orders Only to observe kirsten and report back to me , Not divulge your involvement with the program . You 're with the program ? You know , i actually hadn 't mentioned that To anybody yet , so that one 's on you . Kirsten , wait . Fisher , come with me , please . When you woke up this morning , did you think - The day was gonna turn out like this ? - Hm-mmm . Me neither . Hold up . Come on . Will you wait ? Don 't touch me . You lied to me . I did not . I didn 't volunteer the truth , but i never lied . How long have you been spying on me for ? Pretty much the entire last year . Look , after we became roommates , Maggie had me brought in here and made me an offer . They 'd pay all my expenses And my grad school costs if i just spied on you . All your living expenses and your tuition costs ? Mm-hmm . That is a pretty good offer . I know , right ? And all i had to do was just keep track of you And report back if you did anything strange . And did you ? I didn 't know what to report . Everything you do is strange . And my academic suspension- - that thing with your research ? They put me up to that . Look , they needed you ... Badly , And they wanted to incentivize you to join the program . And you wonder why I have such a hard time making friends . ( sighs ) So ... Looks like our kirsten Outplayed both of us on this one . She 's , uh ... Something different . You don 't know the half of it . Does this actually work ? Stitching ? Yes . So what are you going to do with the knowledge You now have about our program ? I haven 't decided . Well , let me help you make the right choice . After we met yesterday , i did some research , On you . What did you find out ? I found out you 're like a pit bull . Once you bite down on a case , Your jaw locks and you don 't let go . But while this may be admirable in a cop , It 's a lousy trait in a husband . Hey , stay in your lane . Your dogged pursuit at work has already cost you your marriage And will likely lead you To be transferred to another division , again . Okay , i think i 'm done here . I also know you 're smart , And you 've been poking around The medical examiner 's office . I know this because the m.E. Is embedded in our program . That 's how we get our samples . Who are you people ? We 're a federal agency With a very wide jurisdiction . Including over the l.A.P.D. ? Particularly the l.A.P.D. Fisher , You are the least popular Honest detective in all of l.A. , But become part of the stitchers program- - I can make you the most successful Least popular honest detective in all of l.A. So i 'm being recruited ? Kirsten is right . It 's obvious I can 't keep them from doing field work . And , frankly , i 'm not sure i should . She sees things when she 's being stitched That only she can follow up on . She 's going to need some kind of backup . Me ? You will remain l.A.P.D. , But on deep-cover loan to the stitchers program . Keep my kids safe . And in return , I will give you the official collar when we close a case . I can 't take credit for someone else 's work . We 're a team . We all take credit . We all share the blame . You know how to be part of a team , don 't you ? Refractory period is over . We can stitch into lisa keller again . Care to see what you 've just agreed to be part of ? I think you may be the devil . I 'm not , But i admire his closing rate . Ayo : Her heart rate is elevating . Listen , geniuses , I 'm still surrounded by monsters . Whatever you did to cancel out the effects of the drugs isn 't working . Because we haven 't done it yet . Linus . Running the filter ... Now . Cameron : Okay , talk to me . How 's it looking ? Better . Much better . Ayo : Her vitals are stabilizing . Now you know what 20 minutes into the future looks like . I see them . Cameron . Isolate and reduce the volume of the background music . Give us a moment . I 'm going to get you out of here . To where ? Back to the shelter ? For now . Then i 'm gonna get you home to montana . Raff will take care of me . He says he 's got a big score coming . A big score ? Stay here . She 's done with you . Got that ? Girl , you are hot when you 're pissed off . You haven 't even seen me pissed off yet . I know about your big score . You keep denise out of it . Whoa ! Now i 'm worried . Let go of me . You think you 're special ? Working with runaways , Trying to save them ? Well , save yourself . Raff 's forcing the drugs into lisa 's mouth . Sweet dreams . Denise , let me help you . It 's too late . Denise , get back in here . I 'm bouncing . 11545 san fernando road . The drugs are in raff 's camera case . Lisa keller used to work with runaway teens . That 's how she met denise . Lisa was trying to get denise away from raff , so he killed her . - Certainty ? - 100 % . - We 're gonna need a warrant . - Based on what ? I 'm confident you 'll figure something out . Hey , fisher . Welcome to the stitchers program . Raff : Listen , man , this stuff is not available anywhere . Yeah , just like that show , Except for this is green , not blue , and it 's for real . Listen , i want to put you on my list , but you gotta commit . My man . ( crying ) What are you crying about ? Huh ? I don 't want anything to do with this . When we first met , You never told me anything about drugs . I understand . I do . I get it . So what you 're telling me is that you want To be back on the streets . Is that what you 're telling me , huh ? 'cause that 's where i 'll dump you- - Right where i found you . I just want to go home . Baby , you are home . ( crash ) Victor thomas , you 're under arrest For the murder of lisa keller . Denise , my name is kirsten . We 're gonna get you out of here . Sit down . How did you know where i was ? Lisa told me . - Aren 't you supposed to read me my rights ? - Eventually . - ( computer beeps ) - his computer 's password-protected . Password , please . What do you need that for ? Because it 's faster than hacking into your computer To figure out where you 're getting your drugs from . - Password . - Screw you . Password , please . This is police brutality . Too bad for you we 're not the police . ( taser crackles ) I 'm gonna go get changed . Oh , good . You 're here . Did you get the call - About prepping ed for being stitched ? - Yes , i did , but- - Hey , cameron , how quickly can you change the computers over ? Guys , wait . Listen . It 's too late . - No , this isn 't right . - What 's not right ? Ed 's hit his best-by date . He can no longer be stitched . That 's bull . No , it 's true . His neural gaps Have widened beyond stimulation . There 's nothing to stitch . I 'm sorry . Kirsten , i 'm so sorry . You knew exactly what you were doing . You deliberately brought in the keller case To keep me from stitching into ed 's memory . You give me too much credit . Did they know ? Were they a part of your plan- - Camille , linus and cameron ? No , because there was no plan . I 'm sorry about ed , but this happens sometimes . You promised me . No , i said that if you can solve the keller case fast enough , You could stitch into ed . You didn 't . And you can 't . What is it that ed knows that you don 't want me to see ? The reason i hardly remember my parents , Or where my father is ? The truth about who really killed ed ? Come with me . As we speak , ed 's apartment is being boxed up . Tomorrow all of his stuff will be delivered To the home that he left you . Every shred of paper , photograph , book , Flash drive , and dust bunny Is going to be yours . Perhaps the answers that you 're looking for Will be in those boxes . Look at her , Because i need you to understand , All of you , What you did here today . Where would denise be without the stitchers program ? Kirsten , You gave lisa keller back her voice , Even if only for a short time , To finish what she started . You know those monsters that you saw in her memory ? Well , there are monsters everywhere , And with this technology , we can stop them . ( sighs ) i looked , kirsten . There aren 't any monsters under your bed . Look again , ed . There are no such thing as monsters . Well , i never did like monsters . Let 's go get ' em . ( heart monitor beeping ) ( theme music playing ) ¶ take me inside . ¶

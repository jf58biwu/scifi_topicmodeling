 Come on guys , we 've got to get going ! Are you doing a film about the zoo ? Yes , we 're film students . My grandson Carlo would like to help . - Will this be on television ? - No , we 're just film students . Paula , go get the director . But we 're shooting now . Is this OK for the camera ? Turn off your cell phones ! Pleased to meet you , Mr. Zankovski . - Is the sound OK ? - All I hear is monkeys . - That shirt 's no good . - I have another one in the office . That 's OK , just button up the jacket . Your zoo is a meeting place for different species ... monkeys inside the fence and people on the outside ... how do those species get along ? People are always very interested in the monkeys ... because they resemble us ... so they 're our main attraction . Everyone loves the baby monkeys ... because they 're so playful ... All I can hear now is monkeys screaming . What 's going on ? The whole zoo is going berserk ! They 're scared . See , they 're hiding . Look up there . Tilt the camera up , Erik ! Looks almost like a UFO . Is that a plane ? Are you filming this ? Is that a comet or something ? It 's going down ! Wow , it came out of nowhere . Production meeting . Will we change our plans ... because Erik saw something in the sky ? Guys we can 't just throw our schedule overboard . Paula , all we want is to check this out . Here 's the impact ! NO news coverage ... maybe we 're the only ones who saw it . But what is it ? I think it 's a comet . If it impacted it 's not a comet but a meteorite . Seriously , guys , we 're on a tight schedule here ... we still have to film the elephant baby , the giraffe , the anteater ... Just imagine if we really found something ... we 'd make film school history . Where will we be heading ? It impacted somewhere south-west ... so we 'll just keep driving until we see something . Couldn 't it just be a camera error ? Oh , please ! We 're students , we 're supposed to take risks . Wisely put . You 're outvoted , we 're going . You 're out of your minds . Don 't throw a tantrum . Excuse me ? The deadline is next week . This is a complete waste of time . If we find a meteorite crater we might be able to sell ... our footage to a network . Don 't push it , André . We need to pack supplies . I 'm not going . I love the smell of fresh meteorites in the morning . We 're on the road again ... after a small change of plans ... chasing after whatever it is we saw in the sky . Where are we heading , monsieur ? For the thousandth time : south-west . We outvoted Paula in a democratic fashion . No reason to make a face . You 're such dumbasses . What a waste of time ! Erik - let 's check the radio . Nothing . We 're the only ones who have seen anything . We 've seen something , without a doubt . And I hope we 'll find something . Let 's hope ... it 's not a plan crash or some military stuff . I 'm not pissed off I just don 't see the point . Maybe we should ask if anyone has seen anything . Like : Sorry , mister , did you see anything crash into the forest ? Right , and then that guy will steal our story . Oh , yeah , don 't want to risk that . It must have crashed somewhere deep in the forest ... otherwise someone would have noticed . Sure . Deep in the forest . Look out for smoke . André-cam : The results of our mission - paltry . Our team - exhausted and conflicted . Our spirits - unbroken ! I 'm about ready to break something . How much longer ... do you want to drive through the Pampa ? The Pampa is in Argentina , isn 't it , Paula ? We said we 'd try to find something ... so that 's what we 're doing . I 'm not bitching ... but we 've been trying for four hours . And I have to go really bad . I 'm never going on a trip with you guys again . It 's like traveling with kindergartners . At least the landscape 's nice . Whoopty doo . We 're in the forest . You 're just a spoiled city-brat . André-cam stays on task . What , are you a stalker ? I 'm just recording everything . It 's the André-cam . OK , now WE will do an André-cam . Let 's drive off without him . Step on it ! Wait , wait ! Step on it ! OK , that 's enough . That 's not funny . Let me in . If we drive fast we might make it home by nine . Your comets have cost us half the day . ... our meteorites . At least we gave it a try . Stop , stop , do you see that ? Stop the car , Paula ! God , people , I want to go home now ! I see it too . That 's smoke ! Looks like something crashed over there . There it is ! Back up the car ! Take a right over there . Here ? Do you still see the smoke ? Wow , pretty bad smash-up over here . Looks like it just happened . Please get out and have a look . It 's ripped open . Looks like a huge claw-mark . There 's nothing we can do . Let 's go . We can 't just leave , we have to get help . The guy probably got help already . We 're not really allowed to drive here . If they catch us we 'll just say it was your idea . I think we 've found it . Looks pretty bad . What is it ? Everything 's burned . Let 's take a look . A meteorite wouldn 't do that . Something crashed here . That 's metal . Are you OK ? Don 't touch this frigging thing , it 's hot as hell . - What is it ? - Metal parts . The funnel goes all the way back . The tree is peppered with metal fragments ... what the hell happened here ? You have to have a look at this . Wait Leo ! There are more fragments here . Maybe an airplane or a rocket . Doesn 't look like airplane parts to me . Watch out , I told you not to touch it ! I think we should alert somebody . There 's even more parts here . Didn 't you say it 's a meteorite ? I think this is even better ! What are you doing ? We 're losing daylight , so I 'm setting up a camera light . We 'll just go back and let someone know . Do you want to shoot a documentary or not ' ? If we go back now the whole area will be fenced off tomorrow . And all the big networks will steal the story . We can 't keep this to ourselves . That 's not cool . Maybe the Americans have lost one of their drones . No matter what ... I want to be the first one to find out ! Just imagine if we could find out what it was . We 'll search the area tomorrow . Oh , we 're sleeping in the forest now ? In the van . Night is falling over Marlborough country . Erik , how many batteries are left ? More than enough , why ? - Memory cards ? - Also enough . Why ? Well , going back now would take over two hours , right ? And tomorrow , everything will be fenced off . So you really want to sleep in the forest ? We could sleep in your bus . All of us ' ? We 'll crash here , and tomorrow we 'll see what 's what . So , good night . A ball of light in the sky , a burned landing lane - hello ? Time for some cock-and-bull-stories . I 'll just say it out loud then : UFOs , Aliens ! André , you 're such a geek . A sweet , little geek but still a geek . Wait , I 'm no geek ! I 'll go dream of little green men now . Don 't forget to put the fire out . Good night , geeks . Repeat the word " coffee " very quickly . Just do it . Ka-fucka-fucka-fucka I 'm not sure if I 've seen a UFO ... but it seems like the most likely explanation . All those metal parts and the other stuff ... seem like they 're from another world . But it could 've been an airplane . Did that ball of light look like a plane to you ? I think you 're just an alien freak ! You asshole . Go f * * k yourself ! I 'm so sorry ! Like hell you are ! Come have a look guys . Camera gear : 4000 Euros . Guess jeans : 70 Euros . Sleeping in the van : priceless . Sorry André , the van 's full . Just take the blanket . Good night guys . Good night André . Don 't let the earthworms bite . Paula , dream of me . Go to hell ! There 's something in the forest . Stupid bird ! There 's a high pitched sound , don 't know if it will be ... audible on the recording . What is that ? What is that ? I can 't believe he just left the camera out here . At least it 's not broken . Let 's go look for him . Where did he go ? The camera was over there . What is this horseshit ? What if something happened to him ? We 're scouring the forest . Fucking André ! Incredible . You gave him quiet a scare yesterday . But that 's no reason to run off . It 's not funny , André . Let 's just wait . I 'm sure he 'll be back . Big mystery , where 's André ? Why did he just walk off into the forest ? Quiet , he 's saying something ! Fuck - what was that ? Go back ! It 's only on three frames . What on earth is this ? Can 't really make out anything . Calm down Melissa , this isn 't helping . That 's it , I 'm calling the cops . What if he was attacked by an animal . Or dragged into the forest . Shit , I don 't have a signal . Could you try ? Mine 's dead too . Didn 't you call your girlfriend just yesterday ? Yeah , I had a signal then . Alright , everybody calm down . We can 't just drive off . Do you have a better idea ? Who knows how long it will be before we are able to alert anyone ... meanwhile André could be bleeding to death or something . He 's right . If you want to run into the forest , be my guests . I 'm going back to get help . We 're heading south . Do you hear this ? Shit , do you see anything ? Something 's coming . Maybe there are wild boars out here . I thought you wanted to go back . I 've just been following your shouts . Let 's look for him so we can finally get out of here . Christ , Paula , I 'm going to attach a cowbell to you ! We 're so far from the car now , what 's the point ' ? He can 't have disappeared into thin air . Shit . What ? What is it ? Lots of blood . There 's more on that tree . It can 't be André 's . Must be from an animal . Looks fresh . Shit . Look at how much there is . Stop filming , that 's gross . Do you think it 's André 's ? Must be from those birds over here . Have a look at this . What is that ? They 're everywhere . I once heard a similar story : ... In the US they found hundreds of dead birds in the streets . It just keeps going . Must be an epidemic . Looks like it , judging from the amount of birds . Perhaps it 's contagious . I think we should keep going . Oh , shit ! What 's going on ? What is it ? Up there in the tree . Don 't come here ! Stay away ! We 're recording this for the police . This recording show 's the body of our friend André Selke . We recognize his t-shirt . Something must have smashed him against the tree with great force . Stop filming him ! What kind of animal would do something like that ? This can 't be true . Perhaps it isn 't André after all . Get us out of here ! Could have been a Leopard . Leopards drag their prey into trees . Leopards in Germany ? What kind of bullshit are you talking ? Get us out of here ! Get us out of here . I want to go home ! Are you sure this is the right way ? We are so lost ! Still no reception . Whichever way we turn , it still says north . The compass is all fucked up . Keep walking ! That wasn 't André ! I don 't believe it ! When are we finally gonna get home ? The car can 't be much farther . Come on ! We came from the north so that 's where we 're going ! I can 't go one more step . I 'm hungry , and I 'm tired . I just can 't go on ! Then what , Melissa ? Do you want to spend another night in the forest ? It 's getting dark , we can 't stay here ! Shut up , Leo , just shut up ! I 'm doing the best I can ! What do you expect me to do ' ? The forest can 't be so big . At some point we 'll have to hear traffic sounds or something . Look around you , we 're in the middle of nowhere . What are you doing ? Come on ! I 'm coming . That 's water ! Guys , it 's water . Wait . It 's drinkable . Erik , have some water . We 'll follow the creek . That should take us somewhere . Let 's not stay too long . I 'm so hungry . We 're all hungry . What 's that ? Be quiet ! - Do you hear that ? - F * * k ! It 's back there in the forest . Come on ! Make it stop , Leo ! Make it stop ! Quiet , God dammit , it 'll hear us ! Do you still hear it ? Do you see anything ? Do you think it 's gone ? F * * k , we 're going in circles . I 'm completely spent . We should find a place to sleep . I 'm all for that . You mean sleep in the forest ? It 's too dark to find our way out of here anyway . This pit could work as a sleeping place . What happened to Andre ' ? Do you think there 's some kind of maniac running around in the forest ? One person couldn 't do that all by himself . - You 'd need a whole slaughterhouse . - Please ! Slaughterhouse ... I still have the rope . If we tie ourselves all together ... we 'll know immediately if something happens to one of us . Erik , where are you ? What 's going on ? When I woke up , Erik was gone . Oh , shit ! Quiet ! Shit ! Leo , you can 't go now ! I can 't find him . Something happened to Erik yesterday . We 'll keep looking until we find him ! What is it ? We haven 't done anything to deserve this ! We 'll be slaughtered one after the other ! Who was that ? What is this sick shit ? Erik is dead , and it 's your fault ! Stop screaming , Melissa ! Have you lost it ? Stop it ! Piss off , Leo ! Come on , Melissa , we 'll keep looking until we find him ! We 're only here because of you . We have to keep looking . What 's the point ? We all know what happened ! We have to stick together , Paula ! Screw that ! Now what ? Follow the blood trail . Shit , Leo . Wait ! I won 't desert him . The blood trail continues over here . Look up there . What the hell is going on with the birds ? They 're scared . As if they sensed a predator . What is that ? Disgusting . - God damned . - That 's blood . Something 's flickering inside . Have you ever seen anything like this ? What the hell is this ? It 's a big nest . It 's a big nest , we 've got to get out of here . Somethings moving inside . There are strange sounds coming from the cliff over there . It leads into the stone crevice . I 'll have a look at it . You want to go inside , Leo ? We have to get out of here . I want to know what it is ! Think about what happened to André and Erik . You stay here and think if you want . I 'm going in . Shit , Leo ! What are you doing , Paula ? Stay here . I 'm not coming , you 're both crazy . The humidity is fogging up the lense . Come back ! Shit ! Look at all the blood . We have to get out of here ! What kind of animal is this ? It 's moving . It 's alive . Let 's get out of here ! My God . Those are human body parts in there . Come quickly , please . Wait , wait . There , it 's moving ! This thing has sucked them dry . Leo , have you lost your mind ? I 'm going to end this now . Leo , wait , wait ! That 's acid ! Run ! Run ! What is this ? I want to know what it is . Are you crazy ? Turn it off ! I can 't get it off ! Run ! In here ! Come on , there must be another way out . What was that ? I don 't know . Some kind of alien creature . But where did it come from ? No idea . But there were human body parts inside of it . That f * * king stuff hit me on the leg . This doesn 't look good at all . Can you walk ? Do you hear that ? It 's looking for us . Move it ! It 's a dead end ! Get back , it 's a dead end ! There must be another way out somewhere ! Is it gone ? I think it 's gone ! Where 's Melissa , she was right behind me . I can see daylight . I think I found the exit . Be careful , it 's slippery . Paula ! I got you ! Hold on ! Hold onto this ! L got you ! How 's your leg ? It 's burning real bad . Hang in there . What was that thing ? I 'll bet no one 's ever seen anything like it before . Don 't you get it ? André was right ... The ball of light over the zoo . That wasn 't a meteorite . Are you saying it was a UFO ? These things don 't exist ! Then what about that creature ' ? Did you see how many eggs there were ? We have to warn people . What if nobody believes us ? They will when they see the footage . It was here . They 're hatching . Shit ! What is this ? " ' 8 gone ! Paula isn 't doing well . What is it , Paula ? I 'm OK . I feel sick . What is it Paula ? It 's pure blood ! The thing poisoned her . We have to get her to a doctor ! Over there ! We made it . Just a little further , Paula . Anybody in there ? We need help here ! There 's something over there in the grass . Is it a human ? I think it 's a cow . It 's been completely eaten away by acid . I 'm not sure we should go inside . Hello ? Anybody in here ? There 's food ! They tried to burn the things . Anybody here ? You 've got to see this . Here , in the kitchen . Dammit ! I put my hand right into it . Be careful . It 's fresh . God , it stinks in here . Where has everybody gone ? Either they fled or they 're dead . We need a telephone . There must be one somewhere . Finally ! Goddammit ! Do you see that ? My God ! What was that ? I want to know what it is . Keep walking , Leo ! Run ! Paula , run ! We 're not safe here ! It 'll see us ! Melissa , please be quiet . You have to help me now , I can 't do this on my own . We 'll hide up there , OK ? What if it comes for us ? Come , it won 't find us here . Paula is dead . What kind of a nightmare is this ? The battery for the light is almost dead . Have you seen how fast they are ? How is that possible ? I don 't know what it is ... but it 's something from another world . I can 't go on . We only have to survive the night . There must be a road near the farm . That 'll get us out of here . At daylight we 'll sneak over to the road . Then we 'll be saved . We 'll die , too . No , we 'll make it ! Melissa , please stop . Do you remember , last summer ... Sabine 's birthday party ? Manuel was so drunk he had to throw up three times . You were pretty wasted , too . And you wanted to go swimming in the river . It took three of us to hold you back . And when we weren 't looking you sneaked back to the water ... slipped on the rocks and banged your head . Do you still have the bump ? Yes , .. Here . How can anybody be so crazy ? I was warm . There 's only us two left . Melissa is downstairs , she had to ... go . We have to assume that Paula 's dead . We have to keep going .

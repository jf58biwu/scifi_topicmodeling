 Who is that ? Get up ! They come from all over . Pocket knife from the Philippines , Vietnamese penlight , matchbook and condoms from China . Even pirates play it safe sometimes . But this is the key . When the pandemic hit , pirates looted the Singaporean reserve bank for gold coins , and this became their currency . They 're the only ones in the region who use it . Where do they spend it ? Shanzhai . It 's an ungoverned Dodge City on China 's south coast . China ? You want to go back to Peng 's backyard ? Well , essentially , it 's an open city . If the pirates had a capital , this would be it . Before the attack in Vietnam , we tracked three boats in formation . By last night , there was only the one . This could be where the other two went . Seems like our best shot , sir . Get St. Louis on the line . Set a course for Shanzhai . Any idea just where in the hell we are , Master Chief ? A rock and a hard place now . I put us somewhere about 400 miles from Haiphong . North Star was sitting at about 30 degrees when we boarded that ship . We can see where it rises tonight and maybe get a ballpark on our latitude . Welcome ! Now you rest ! Where 's our captain ? Where is he ? Where is he ? ! Enjoy your new home . Who the hell do you think you are ? You speak English ? You know what you did ? You know who we are ? You can 't do this . You 're wrong , Captain Slattery . I know exactly who you are . No , no , no . No . No , no , no . No . No , sir . Our rescue swimmers didn 't find any of our people in the wreckage . We still don 't know if they were on that vessel . Lieutenants Burk and Green did manage to escape the attacks in Vietnam . They were attempting to gather intel from at least a half a dozen kidnappers when Burk was shot . He 's here now . The corpsmen are taking care of him . All that said , we have no concrete leads right now to help us find our people . But you 're certain Peng is behind this . He blew up our plane , to be sure But we have reason to believe that pirates from Shanzhai were responsible for the attack in Vietnam . So ... We sortie the ships in Okinawa . Shackleton and Hayward can be in the region in a matter of days . I appreciate that , sir , but those ships need to be in Japan , investigating the possibility of the virus mutation . And a larger presence here may draw attention , and it could be counterproductive . I need a lower profile . You ? You 're the Chief of Naval Operations and , for all intents and purposes , the head of our entire military . I need you running our global operations from here . Sir , the James is without its senior leadership . I can 't just leave anybody ... I understand your loyalty to your people , Tom . This isn 't just about my people . You sent me here because the region is a tinderbox . I need to stay here now and find out why this happened , what the bigger play is ... Not just to save my crew . Though I believe that will be the first step , sir . I want to know where you 're going and what you 're doing at all times . Understood , sir . Bring ' em home , then . I will . Thank you . What the hell are you doing to me ? _ Aah . I 'm gonna kill you , you son of a bitch . Come on in . Thank you for loaning me the digis . I 'm glad they fit , sir . Your name tag 's being made , and we 'll get those eagles for the collar . And you should know Lieutenant Burk is stable . HM2 Logan pulled a 762 slug from his leg . I heard . He 's tough , your brother . Always has been . I want you to know ... While I 'm in command of the ship and until the return of your shipmates , I 've decided to make Lieutenant Granderson my acting X.O. I understand you have seniority over her , but I cannot afford to lose you running combat right now . You think I made the wrong call ... Not contacting the CO when I sensed there was trouble in Vietnam . That ... was a difficult decision . 50 / 50 in my book . Problem is , you think it was the wrong call and then you overcompensated . Sir , we 'd been tracking that vessel . At the time , it was our only lead . And then you chased it into shallow waters , leaving you out of position for the rescue , forcing me to fire on that boat when we still didn 't know if our people were on it . You 're too hot now , and I can 't have my X.O. making emotional decisions . But I do need you in CIC . You 'll have me , sir . So , where 'd you learn to fly ? RAAF ? Australian Antarctic . No , you 're lying . Rich pricks love their volcanoes . Hey . How long till your bird can fly ? Not soon enough . Then I 'm out of here and this will all be a bad memory . - You 're going ? - That 's what I said . I 'd say we should keep in touch , but that 's not your thing . - Jesse . We need you . - I got you here . Now I got to get back to what I do . Your cover 's blown . You 'll be the dead the minute you hit Chinese airspace . So I 'll go to Phnom Penh or Mandalay . They need cure . I was headed there next , anyway . Look , I get it , all right ? You 're mad at me . But these people are the only ones strong enough to take on Peng and the people who killed your brother . If you want to help the rest of the world , you should be helping them . This isn 't my fight . Captain on the Bridge ! - Welcome back , sir . - Good to see you , Gator . Mike Slattery 's the Captain of this ship . A simple " attention on deck " will do . Understood , sir . And I 'll never sit in Commander Garnett 's chair . How 's our new helo ? Could be operational in 24 hours . Not so sure I can say the same about the pilot . She 's a hell of a pilot , and we need her . We 've never operated this ship without a helo , and I don 't want to start now . I 'll handle it , sir . How far to the next objective ? Once we make it past Qiongzhou Haixia , we bear north at 345 degrees and we 'll be at Shanzhai within four hours . There 's a natural harbor there . It 's wide but usually filled with boats and debris . The only other way in would be climb a 100-foot rockface . Cruz and Evans will lead Cobra Team and stand by for the exfil on the beach while the T.A.O. runs combat . How do you want to get in , sir ? We 'll commandeer a local boat into Shanzhai Harbor . I 'll disembark with Green and Taylor . Are you kidding ? You can 't go . You 're the most recognizable face in the world . Even in Asia . I 'm down three operators . So for today , I 'm just a body with a gun . And if you die , you crew has just lost another CO . A word . What , am I being called into the principal 's office ? Is this your way of getting me to trust you ? Challenging me in front of my crew ? I challenged you because I think you could compromise the mission . I 'm fully capable of handling this with Wolf , Green , and their teams . Well , I appreciate your self-confidence , but I think , at this point , I know how to run my ship . You just demoted a senior lieutenant and put a 28-year-old in the X.O. ' s chair while you jump headfirst into the battlefield again . Is this about leadership or your needing to control everything ? Controlling everything is how I 've made it this far . And as long as you 're on my ship , you take orders from me . Understood ? Aye , aye . Your man 's a hypocrite . I read every incident and action report he 's ever logged , and he would have done the exact same thing as me in that situation . Maybe . Or maybe he would have sent the RHIB to chase down that vessel and left the James in position . I mean , point is , Lieutenant Granderson 's been knee-deep in it with him and you haven 't . They have a short-hand . She knows how he thinks . Yeah , and y 'all know better ? Like I was eating wings in Hooters when you were off saving the world ? - That 's not what I 'm saying . - For three months , I kept 400 alive ... - With no tomahawks and no cure . - You know that 's not what I 'm saying . Look , you don 't know the guy ! Look , whatever went down , it 's not on you , all right ? All that matters is that you forget this crap , you do your job , and you help us find our guys . You 're a goddamn vampire . The short answer is , yes . The corn yields surpassed projections , but we 're still short with respect to ethanol production . - Mr. President ! - Mr. President ! - Yes ? - Davis Vickers , Northeast Corridor . Has there been any progress on repair of the rail lines since the riots in Philadelphia ? Incremental progress . Now , I know that reconnecting New York , Philadelphia , and Washington is a priority in your region , and we 're doing the best that we can . - Mr. President ! - Mr. President ! Yes ? Mr. President , Jacob Barnes , mid-Atlantic region . What can you tell us about Captain Chandler 's progress in China ? Captain Chandler is making good , solid progress in difficult negotiations with President Peng . It 's our position that China needs to do its part to distribute the cure to the people among that region . So Captain Chandler is only there to discuss the cure ? Because we 've been hearing reports of border confrontations between Vietnam and China . And I 'm wondering if President Peng is using his control of the cure in Asia to make us choose sides in a foreign conflict . With all that 's going on here at home , is Captain Chandler there to prevent a war in Asia ? Captain Chandler 's only agenda is the fast , free flow of the contagious cure throughout the world . Now , he 's only just arrived in Hong Kong . When we get further reports , you all will be the first to know . Mr. President ! Vulture Team , radio check . Cobra Team reads you , Lima Charlie . 1,000 yards from rally point Alpha . This is Vulture Team going silent . Roger , Vulture Team . Nathan James standing by . T.A.O. , anything on radar or sonar ? No bogeys . Just fishing trawlers . Keep looking . Roger that ... Ma 'am . You said it . Dodge City . It 's not Hell , but you can see it from here . Well , at least no one 's shot at us yet . Kind of wish they would . Least we 'd know we were close . Wake up . We need help . Run for your life . Get shot at . Blow up a boat . Crash-land . See the world . Ma 'am ? Here 's your new torque pedal . You can spare me the inspirational speech . I already told Sasha I 'm leaving . I don 't think you understand how much we need your helo . Look . I 'm sorry about what happened to your crew . I know what it feels like . But I got to get back to my life , or what 's left of it . I don 't know what happened between you and Ms. Cooper back in China , but I heard you risked your life to get the cure to those who need it most . That makes us allies . I hope you can see that you can use our help as much as we can use yours . Or you can keep feeling sorry for yourself . Either way , our crew will help you get your bird back into shape . - Nice work , Chief . - I 'm trying , Ma 'am . What are you doing , Master Chief ? Determining local noon . See , you measure the shadow every 60 seconds until it starts getting longer . Then count back to the shortest shadow . That 's local noon . From there , you can estimate your longitude . What do you see out there , Doc ? Their security 's pretty tight , especially that hut across the compound . I saw that , too . We have to get a look outside the perimeter , Ma 'am . That 's a decision for the Captain . Oh , my God ! What have you done to him ? ! - Hey ! - Hey ! Don 't ... - What are you doing ? - Get your hands off me ! Hey ! - Sir ? - I 'm okay . What 'd they do ? Where 'd they take you ? Tied me down . Took my blood . Why ? So much blood . _ _ _ _ So ... _ _ _ _ He 's not so pleased to see you , Tom . Says you 're bad for business . But he knows why you 're here . Everyone heard about the kidnapping . He swears he has nothing to do with it . He knows nothing about it . Do you believe him ? Absolutely not . Neither do I. The latest in Navy weapons . Better than the crap you 're peddling . Guns for information . You like this ? IWC Chronograph , made for the pilots at Miramar . Top Gun . I need answers . There is a man . Kenji . He came in here bragging about the kidnapping , throwing money around . He says he threw him out of here . Where is this Kenji ? Luilichang . Luilichang . It 's a flea market . - You know where it is ? - I do . Assuming you 've told us the truth , you 'll never see me here again . If you lied ... or should something happen to me when I leave here , my ship will drop a half a dozen tomahawks on this dump you call your kingdom . Now , that would be bad for business . _ It 's been a pleasure . Top Gun . Master Chief 's been gone for over two hours . You tend to pass out afterwards . How long was the needle in your arm , Captain ? Half-hour , give or take . It 's like they 're taking our blood and feeding it to half their crew . During our first trials , when you got sick , Dr. Scott used Bertrise 's blood to buy some time . Maybe they 're sick . Why take our blood when there 's a cure ? A feast for you . Eat . Apricots and steak ... All rich in iron . Fattening up the cows for the milk . You join me , Captain . I eat with my crew . No , no , no . You 're a captain . You eat with me . You were military before the pandemic . Japanese Maritime Self-Defense . We probably met at RIMPAC one summer . You 're a captain ? That was another life . And now you 're a pirate . Times changed . I adapted . Funny . I didn 't get that memo . Bad as things got , I never went around kidnapping innocent people , draining their blood . " Innocent . " Hmm . Eat , Captain . Get your strength . Ms. Green ? Hi . Jacob Barnes . Good to see you . Yes . Hi , Jacob . Hey , if you 're free , uh , maybe we could go for a drink . You could give me the lay of the land , help me better understand the man behind the curtain . Uh , no . I 'm sorry . I have to get home to the baby . Maybe schedule a coffee through my office . And it 's Mrs. Green . Nothing behind that . Sorry . No problem . Hey , are we going to war with China ? What would make you say something like that ? POTUS was a little dodgy on the subject at his presser last night . Haven 't seen even one photo op of Chandler and Peng , not even a handshake . It makes me wonder what 's going on . And so you jump to war as a conclusion ? The President 's strategy is classified . But rest assured , it 's working . Mrs. Green ... While you were out on the James , there was a deafening silence from the top . It cost lives . Suffice to say that it 's been a while since any of us could rest assured . You have the President 's ear . I 'd just remind him not to forget that . I 'll call your office for that coffee . Hey . Russ . Russ , how you doing ? His pressure 's too low . He 's dehydrated . Here . Whoa . Slow , slow . Slow down . They had him in there too long . Sir ? I think I found a way out of here . The bolts are rusted . They 'll never know how we got out . I 'm thinking Diaz and me pick our moment , slide through , down and out , get past the perimeter , see what 's out there , report back . I don 't like it . Too many guards , too many dogs . We can handle this , sir . This will keep ' em busy . They won 't kill us , sir . Not if they need our blood . Compliments of the X.O. She 's mocking us . Thought you could change her mind with a Happy Meal and a carton of smokes ? No . But I heard she loves cherry cola . How would you handle it , Lieutenant ? - I wouldn 't let her leave . - What would you do ? Conscript her ? Put a gun to her head ? Either sounds good , yeah . Cobra Team , request your whiskey . Cobra Team , check . Read you Lima Charlie . We are at point Zebra . Standing by for exfil . Kenji . No . Kenji ? These people aren 't from around here . They all came looking for black-market cure , and no one knows anyone named Kenji . Okay . Where to next ? Where are they ? ! Where did you get this ? ! No English ! Who gave it to you ? ! Did you get this from my sailors ? No ! No English ! _ Tell me now ! Men from Vietnam selling clothes . I liked the shirt . Who ? ! Who ? ! Pirates ? ! No , no ! No pirates ! - Please ! - Captain . MSS are here . Time to go . Hold up . Hold up . Cobra Team , this is Vulture Team . Rally point Alpha is blocked . Heading to rally point Bravo . Do you copy ? Captain , Zebra is compromised . We 've got MSS crawling all over the place . We 'll get to rally point Bravo when able . I say again , rally point Bravo when able . MSS on all sides . We 're outgunned . We need a choke point . There . Through the bar . It 's worth a shot . MSS ! MSS ! 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 , 97 ... Please . No pirates . No pirates . How 's the other guy ? I am the other guy . Shit . East . 300 paces south-southeast . Nathan James , this is Cobra ! We 're under fire at rally point Zebra ! We 're pinned down by the MSS ! Fall back , fall back , fall back ! How bad is it ? I 'm still in the fight , bro . Then move ! Move , move ! Cobra Team . We 're taking fire here at rally point Bravo . Roger that , Vulture . We 're trying to exfil Zebra for Bravo . We 'll be there as soon as we can . Vulture , we 're heading to Bravo now . Hey . Do you know what that is ? Those are my crewmates , and they 're getting cut to pieces out there . You cannot leave them out there . What do you think I 'm doing out here ? Wave me off for Green Deck ! Now give me the goddamn coordinates so I can pick them up . - I 'll need a gunner . - You got it . And it wasn 't just the cherry cola and smokes . Please no ... No Takehaya . No Takehaya . What are you saying ? Not supposed to keep the uniforms . I was supposed to burn it . He will kill me . Who ? Who told you to burn the uniforms ? ! - Who ? ! - Takehaya . Kill me ! Captain . Exfil now on the beach . Move ! Move ! Nathan James , I have the package . Heading back to home ... or whatever you call that ship . Doesn 't mean they 're alive . Doesn 't mean they 're dead . It means we 're on the right path . I ran east for 100 paces before I hit water , then north for 600 paces . I saw another beach with several small boats in the sand . Guards all around . There 's no way down . 600 yards to a waterfall . I followed the river to a cliff about 200 feet above a cove . I found a radio tower . Looked operational . " Takehaya " ? You 're sure that 's what Kenji said ? That 's what it sounded like . Well , he 's a pirate . Sort of a legend in the South China Sea . He and his crew have taken credit for ripping off hundreds of ships in the region . To add to his mystique , he adopted the name Takehaya ... The Japanese god of sea and storms . And how do we find this Takehaya ? Nobody 's ever been able to track him . He 's a ghost . So , is he real or not ? He 's real . But I heard that he was dead . Not to Kenji . He chose to let MSS shoot him to pieces rather than rat on the legend . No ransom , no demands . If Takehaya 's a pirate , what the hell does he want with us ? Takehaya ! Takehaya ! Takehaya ! Takehaya ! Oh , God . Stay strong . Look him in the eye . Mr. President , this is streaming on our local feed . Michael Slattery . Captain , United States Navy . Serial Number 171811120 . I and five members of my crew are prisoners of war . Oh , God . Well , our secret 's out .

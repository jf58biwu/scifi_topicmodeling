 Previously on Defiance ... I see a bright light . It 's a man ... with a powerful flashlight . Amanda , you 're mine . The man who raped me . I was living in New York working as an entry clerk at E-Rep headquarters . Why are you telling me all this ? I didn 't want you to think you 're alone . We received a message from Datak and Stahma . Good news , I hope . They were successful in planting the shrill-infested weapons in the local armory . The town 's entire gun supply was destroyed . What does that madman want ? He wants us to blow up the St. Louis Arch . People of Defiance , our darkest hour has passed . The lights are finally back on . Thanks to our Omec friends , the mines are open , and the gulanite is flowing at a rapid pace . Slowly but surely , we 're getting back on our feet . 'Cause when we 're up against the wall , when many of us had just about lost hope , we persevered , standing beside each other . Always remember who we are . We are free . We are proud . We are Defiance . I can 't speak for the rest of you , Defiance , but I 'm inspired . Here 's some old-world grunge going out to my man Alak Tarr , wherever you are . I notice you didn 't tell the town we were free , proud , and defenseless . No need to start a panic . Shrill destroyed every weapon in our armory . I don 't know about you , but I 'm feeling pretty damn panicked . I think I got something here . Amanda , we 've been going through the old E-Rep files . I think I might have a line on where we can find some weapons . My fellow Votans , I am Commander General Rahm Tak of the Votanis Collective . Today 's a special day . Today is a day of celebration . - I have shown you mercy . - Hologram . I have come here today to liberate you . You three , hey , check the Arch for casualties . He 's gotta be projecting from somewhere close . You still have your homes . You still have your lives . But the continued survival of Defiance is in your hands . I am an honest man . Far more honest than your human mayor . My spies have informed me that all the weapons in your armory have been rendered useless , a fact Amanda Rosewater has kept from you . - Nolan , shut this down ! - Working on it . Like all pink-meat humans , she 's a liar . I am coming to your town . Votans of Defiance , I make you this promise : your life will be spared if you surrender , but for those of you who side with the humans , there will be no mercy . The Arch is only the first salvo . Hitting back will require weapons and lots of them . We may find them here . Station Arrowhead . 300 miles north . An EMC black site , built during the Pale Wars and been sealed up tight ever since the ' 20s . How do we know it hasn 't already been found , looted ? We don 't , but look at the manifest . Automatic weapons , explosives , medical , everything we could hope for . And if we drove all night , we could be there by mid-morning . - This is heavy firepower . - Mm-hmm . Worth rolling the dice . I 'm riding shotgun . You heard the lady . Pack a bag . Wheels up at sundown . - Not you , you 're benched . - Come on . - Benched . - They blew up the Arch . - Don 't care . - Nolan ! You 're gonna stay here with Berlin . You 're gonna figure out who planted those explosives . And you two , you 're gonna work together on this . You hear me ? _ You know how everyone says that Buddy Rich is the best drummer ? I like Gene Krupa better . Krupa , yes . Sing , Sing , Sing . Wonderful beat . A despicable species , the humans , but they do have rhythm . General , sir . Sir , I have an update on Defiance . Datak and Stahma have destroyed the Arch . Ha ! Excellent ! And the hologram ? The entire town saw it . Don 't look so gloomy , Alak . Thanks to your resourceful parents , you live to see another day . But , sir , there is one more thing . Speak freely . There are two Omec in Defiance . One male , one female . _ The Omec ? Like from back on Votan ? Aren 't they ... Quiet ! I 've consulted with my Indogene brothers , and we 're fairly certain that the male is Eksu Tsuroz T 'evgin . He 's a prominent figure in Omec culture . Scientist , inventor , politician , and war hero . Well , why isn 't this glorious renaissance man back home , dead , in space with the rest of the enchanters ? Our long-range scans indicate that he has a ship . It 's in orbit , hovering above Defiance . A warship ? We 're not sure . Its power signature , however , is very low . It 's in need of repair . They need gulanite . That 's why they 're in Defiance . A fully functional Omec warship could destroy the entire Votanis Collective . Eksu Tsuroz T 'evgin needs to die . Send word to Datak and Stahma . Tell them I need it done immediately . What he 's demanding is reckless . We must refuse this order . That 's not an option , and you know it . It 's too soon after the Arch . The entire town 's on high alert . Rahm Tak is going to get us caught . It 's a risk we have to take . Stahma ... _ What ? Out with it . I 've given this a great deal of thought . I don 't believe Rahm Tak will ever release Alak alive . How can you say that ? He married a human girl . Rahm Tak won 't let that go unpunished . No , you 're wrong . Rahm and I shared an oath . I looked him in the eye . Rahm Tak 's eyes are empty ! Even if you 're right , it changes nothing . Killing the Omec buys us time . - Time for what ? - I don 't know ! Time to ... to-to think , to come up with some sort of counter-strategy . What other choice do we have ? The Omec has to die . I suppose you 're right . We have betrayed our neighbors , and so long as that madman has the power to expose us , we must obey his commands for our own survival , if not Alak 's . Is that poison ? I 'll fill a hidden needle and inject the Omec during coitus . Coitus ? It 's a human word . - It means ... - I know what it means . T 'evgin will suffer cardiac arrest , leaving no evidence of foul play . Well , surely there 's some other way . My way is effective and safe . Rest assured , love , I will think only of you . _ Looks like it 's been recently plowed . According to this , underground access is in that barn . Ah , that barn smell . Heh . You mean manure ? What ever happened to romance ? I killed it and ate it . Nolan , you okay ? Just a headache . Leave the fingers . Leave ... leave ... leave ... Ah , ow ! Come with me . I don 't suppose I could hang on to my gun ? No . - Come on , pal . - George isn 't your pal . Neither am I. It 's amazing . You look just like her . Like who ? The girl from the movies . What movies ? What are you talking about ? No more talking . Niles ? Oh , nuts . After our garrison left Defiance , Viceroy Mercado decided to lead us back to New York to provide aid and comfort , and it was futile . Before we made Cincinnati , we were overrun by refugees streaming west . They were burned and bloodied and sick . They 'd lost everything . It was heartbreaking , truly . Ooh , try the Camembert . Try it . It 's divine . We offered them what little comfort we could . Of course , we shared their provisions . Of course . Yeah , that 's right . Thanks , Paul . Many of the refugees joined us as we headed north up to Arrowhead to resupply . Well , I mean , obviously you made it here , but what happened to everyone else ? We hit raiders outside Detroit . I escaped , but Mercado and the others ... they weren 't so lucky . - Doubt it was luck . - Nolan . Come on , I wanna hear this . I made my way here to Arrowhead alone , found the entrance , but I didn 't know the passcode . Would have died from the elements had it not been for an angel who came to my rescue . An angel named George . - I 'm not really an angel . - That 's a matter of opinion . George here brought me inside , and he and his fellow Biomen kept Station Arrowhead humming along since the Pale Wars ended . It 's a remarkable place . It 's completely self-sustaining . It was built as a refuge for the government elite in case the world went to hell . There 's a fully stocked seed vault , functional rain chamber . There 's even DNA samples of old-world animals . Cows and goats , cats and dogs . I had a dog once . He only had three legs . I know , Georgie , I know , but he 's in a much better place now . - Isn 't he ? - Mm . This is the last of the stuff . Guilty conscience eating at you ? It 's a headache . It 's nothing . Look at this . So ? It 's just part of a boom box . The Arch was full of old radio junk . Look at these burns and how the edges are blown out from the inside . This radio was the casing for the bomb . Let 's see if we can get a print off it . So it 's just you here underground ? With your four color-coordinated Biomen . Your own little slice of heaven , if you ask me . Nolan 's sarcasm notwithstanding , yes , I have built quite the pleasant life for myself . I read . I write . I farm . I 've even been known to dabble in carpentry from time to time . You all right ? I 'm glad you 're happy . I appreciate that , Amanda , I do . I 've missed you . I 've missed you an awful lot . Well , before I start blubbing all over myself , let 's get to it . I can 't imagine this is a social visit . What you need ? Food ? Building materials ? Guns . Since the E-Rep fell apart , the Votanis Collective has been growing in strength . They blew up the Arch . Good Lord . It 's gone completely ? Yes . I can only imagine how deeply it affects you , Amanda . Why did you let me prattle on about myself so much ? You were kind of on a roll . I 'm afraid I do still rather enjoy the sound of my own voice . Your request is granted . Ringo , show our friends to the armory . Yeah ? Let them take as many weapons as they can fit into their roller . All right , then . Niles , I can 't thank you enough . My pleasure . Oh , Amanda , Amanda . Could I have a word in private ? I 'm fine . Go . Nolan doesn 't trust me . I don 't trust anyone . Do you wanna blow this ? I 'm not leaving you alone with this guy . I can handle him . I mean it . Go . I 'll be back in ten minutes . Very good . Is this a conversation or a seduction ? Hopefully both . I 've been thinking about six months ago , when I left Defiance for New York , how you refused to join me . You know I care about you ... No , no , no , no , no . It 's-it 's all right . I completely understand . There were so many distractions . Protecting Defiance , rebuilding the E-Rep , fighting the V.C. This period of solitude has ... has clarified certain ... primal sanities . You and I are special . We 're bound together in a deep and fundamental manner . But Eve could not truly join her Adam ... until ... the perfect Eden revealed itself . And now it has . Amanda , what would you say to the idea of staying on here permanently ? ♪ Oh , I want the truth to be said ♪ We getting the band back together ? I didn 't mean to intrude . Surprising an Omec is a dangerous pursuit . Forgive me . I came for your culture lessons . We never specified a time . And that , I think , is a lie . Partially , yes . My husband is in a mood , and I was anxious for some more pleasant company . Something to take my mind off the Arch . The Gateway Arch is a human monument . Why should a Shanje such as yourself care about its destruction ? My son Alak ran the radio station from the top of the Arch . It meant more to him than anything else . I see . Would you care for something to drink ? Haven 't you done enough for Defiance ? I can 't hide underground and watch my town burn . You know that . We 're meant to be together . Yeah ? I belong to you , and you belong to me . Amanda , you 're mine . What ? " You 're mine , " that 's what my attacker said in New York ... Oh , I 'm so sorry . Of course ... Of course you told me all about that night . I 'm so sorry , okay ? It was just ... It was an unfortunate choice of words . No , no , no . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , you think you 're over something , and then it just comes back at you in unexpected ways . Uh , do you have any Scotch ? Real Scotch . That 's bourbon . I checked earlier . Of course you did . I 'll be right back . So you have no idea whether your son is alive or not ? I can only pray to Rayetso for his safe return . I , too , am no stranger to loss of family . I 'm sorry . I have learned to find solace in our great works . The most enduring are about finding meaning in loss . I spent many long nights on my ship considering what the Indogene had done to us . I could not help but wonder if we had not brought tragedy upon ourselves . Death breeds death . The greatest Omec opera was about that very thing . _ Yes . It 's my favorite . Why have you really come here , my lovely little show-off ? I want the truth . The entire truth . Isn 't it obvious ? _ Would you like to go again ? You took a nice shot there . Turn your head to the light , so I can check your pupils . Do you know your name ? Yeah , Joshua Nolan . Good . I 'm Samir . Do you remember what happened to you ? Oh , Bioman took a cheap shot . You a medic ? I was a veterinarian ... before New York got destroyed . But now I work on humans and Sensoths and everything in between . Any nausea ? No , no , I 'm fine . Hard head . Yeah , that cut on your head , how did you get that ? Long , complicated story . Uh , that 's locked , by the way . How many Biomen on site ? Oh , just the Fab Four . Yeah ? You have people with you ? Used to . 30 of us from New York . We managed to escape after the Great Terraforming Disaster . Um , after a few months , we met up with Pottinger 's soldiers on the road . I mean , E-Rep , we thought they 'd keep us safe . Until Pottinger just went nuts . I mean , he put a bullet through his commanding officer 's head and then declared himself in charge . Some of us tried to stop him . People died . After that , Pottinger knew that none of us trusted him , so to keep people in line , he forced me to wire a dead-man switch to his chest . You 're shitting me . If Pottinger 's heart stops beating , it triggers a bomb . What kind of a bomb ? Uh , you remember Portland ? Yeah , I 've seen the crater . He wired himself to a singularity bomb ? Yeah . If he dies , this whole place gets sucked into a wormhole . We gotta get out of here now . Put that down . Where 's Nolan ? In the armory . Can you take me to him ? No . George , why is that door padlocked ? It 's-it 's private . In the elevator , you said I reminded you of the girl in the movies . Who is she ? What did you mean ? Thank you , George . That 'll be all . I should stay . I think she might try to hurt you . Oh . I don 't think she 's happy here . You 're very perceptive , George . Your boss said something to me that reminded me of a bad thing that happened , so , yes , I 'm not happy . But it 's nothing an old-world single malt can 't fix . I can wait outside the doors . What is he , a Bioman or a jealous girlfriend ? Go see to the dishes , George . I shan 't ask you again . Okay . Rather like a Labrador , isn 't he ? So I 've been thinking about your offer . I 'm willing to stay , but there 's a price . Go on . I 'll do anything to keep Defiance safe . You offered us a roller filled with weapons , but that 's not nearly enough . I propose we send Nolan back with the weapons , he returns with a caravan to haul everything back to Defiance . - Everything ? - Mm-hmm . Every single weapon in your armory , down to the last firecracker . Defiance gets the guns , and you get me . All right , jackass . Open the door . The screening room . Now ! Amanda , please . Open it , or I open you . All right , all right . Something you must know about me first . I 'm not well . The abuse I suffered when I was ... attacked by Votans at my boarding school ... Shut up ! Move ! Okay . Okay . How do you like it , hmm ? My special place . What is all this stuff ? This mask . This flashlight . Now listen to me carefully . When I love someone , I become completely and utterly enthralled with them , their tragedies , everything . What 's on these video chips ? Uh , just all the video diaries of ... Play this one with my name on it . Now . Play it ! Now ! Okay . Oh , damn . Such ethereal beauty . I can 't believe I didn 't see this . Before me it was Connor . Ah , we were school chums . He protected me when the Votan attacked . He saved me . I loved him . And then what ? Then you followed him to New York ? Hmm , yes . Connor didn 't want to see me . So sometimes I would follow people who were close to him , so they might lead me to him . Like that night in Central Park when I was attacked ? Yeah , yeah , I saw what happened , and I wanted to stop it , okay ? But I froze . I was a coward . But after your attacker left , I wanted to help you . But how could I justify being there , Amanda ? In that moment , all my guilt , all my shame , my self-hatred , it just exploded into a rage . But I chased after your attacker , and I caught him . I bashed in his skull , and I rolled his body into the the river , for you . Yet you kept his mask and flashlight ? They 're replicas ! Replicas ? Bullshit ! Come on , Amanda . Please put down the gun . That 's it . Pass it to me . Okay , if you shot me , the entire station would 've exploded . Ah ! Looks like we 're all still here . - Let 's move . - I 'm right behind you . You 're not supposed to open the door . Okay , he 's , uh ... he 's really new here . He doesn 't know ... Nice thinking , doggie doctor . Amanda . Come on ! Please , stop . If you kill me , we will all die . I wanna hear you say it . Admit what you did ! Say it ! Please , Amanda ... don 't do this . Say it . Say it . - I love you ! - Say it ! Say it ! Amanda , no ! - Samir ! - I 'm on it ! Keep him alive . Don 't let him die . Come on . Hey . Hey . He raped me . Come on , come on . No , no , no , no , no . It was him . He 's dead . We gotta get out of here . Amanda , come on ! Hey ! We gotta go ! Come on ! Faster ! Faster ! Come on ! Pretty . Ah , you 're awake . I made some pancakes . I got the ingredients from the NeedWant bazaar . Oh , thank you . I hope you like them . Oh . Enjoy them while they 're hot . Oh , your needle . I suppose we should discuss the poison . Poison ? You 're not the first Castithan concubine that has attempted to murder me . Your people know nothing about my physiology , and that 's exactly the way I like it . I have lived for many , many centuries , and the longer my people live , the more difficult we are to kill . So why do you want me dead ? Actually , I don 't . And I don 't want to be killed , so I guess that puts us on the same page . As the humans say . So why the poison ? I lied earlier . I know exactly where my son is . The Votanis Collective have taken him hostage . They ordered me to kill you , or his life would be forfeit . What will you tell them ? The truth . I have failed . Will you try again ? Do I have any chance of success ? I 'm afraid not . What shall you do ? In my entire life , no man has ever made a meal for me . I feel I should thank you . You know whose badge that is . Of course I do . I miss him too . - I loved Tommy . - Shut up ! You don 't kill what you love ! It wasn 't me . It was the machine ! Is it a machine holding a knife to my neck right now ? What the chup ? Nolan , I 'm so sorry . Don 't . If I hadn 't killed Pottinger , we would have those weapons to fight the V.C. Yeah , possible . Also possible that killing Pottinger saved us from being murdered by Biomen or , in your case , something much worse . What 's that for ? For being one of the good guys . Nolan ? Nolan ! Nolan ! He 's bleeding ! Get me a stick ! The blood 's coming from his head wound . - What caused it ? - Some kind of Votan tech . - More specific ! - I don 't know ! You need to make an educated guess because whatever 's inside this man 's head is killing him . What 's wrong with you ? Help me . Please .

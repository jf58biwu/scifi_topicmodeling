 - Krystal Goderitch . - That 's hot ! She 's ... investigating this shit . Identical twin abductors ? How freaky is that ? ! - Things keep happening to me ! - Ah ! - Hi ! - This is Adele , my biological sister . We 're going to pose as perspective parents to determine if this is a Neolutions front . - So , who 's gonna be the father ? - I am . Portia Grossman 's pregnant ? The Grossmans gave up on IVF years ago ! Ask for the Bightborn treatments . I 'm Evie Cho , CEO and founder - of the Brightborn Group . - It 's like a whole new side to Neolution At Brightborn Technologies , we 're making the world a better place one baby at a time . Sure you 're ready for this ? That 's the aggression . - Center your feet , feel the mat . - Get off me ! - Great aggression ... - Your creepy brother ! Unh ! - Whoa-whoa-whoa ! What was that ? - I 'm sorry , I ... I got kidnapped by twins once , nearly , uh ... They killed my boyfriend , Hector . Sometimes it just takes a tragedy to find your own resilience . You know what I mean ? - Yeah , yeah , I feel you . - Can we try other choke holds ? - Yeah , lemme show you this one . - OK . What you wanna do is change the leverage position , OK ? Give me an elbow to the mid-section . Good . Shot to the groin ... perfect . You know , you can be a victim , or you can totally get to the bottom of it , you know ? Good , good . So , I 've been doing all this internet research , and I 've discovered that DYAD , Hector and the twins ; they 're all connected . OK , so ... Umph ! Damn , girl ! What the hell you been doing that got you so strong ? I 'm training like I 'm on a mission . - Can we do it again ? - You wanna do it again ? - Yeah ! Hell yeah . - Alright . Go , let 's start . - I 'm gonna be ready for them this time . - From the top . OK . Ah ! Yah ! Shit , woman ! WOO ! When you 're painting , you want to go side to side if it 's long ... Right . and then , things like the clouds or the mountains all point to the castle 'cause they 're really high . You have to paint up and down . Is this like Uncle Felix 's mural ? Don 't tell Felix , but I like this much better . Don 't tell him that . Let me guess , you have to go . No , nothing is getting in the way - of having a fun day together ! - No ! Not even dragons ! - Hey . - Hey . Did you see that research that Alison sent ? - Did you look at it ? - Yeah , I ... glanced at it . Her and Cosima are obsessed with this Brightborn IVF Neolution connection . Yeah , but that Evie Cho ... she was on the board of DYAD . Oi . " GeneConnexion " . That 's the company Felix used to find his bio-sister ? - I don 't know , is it ? - They 're owned by Brightborn I knew there was something about Adele ... NO ! No you don 't . It 's probably a coincidence . I 've researched everywhere , academic journals , medical forums ... I can 't find any data on the Brightborn Treatments . The enhancement for embryos ? Enhancement could mean anything . Whatever these clients are paying for , Brightborn isn 't sharing it with the scientific community . Oh , Dude ... the " Exclusive Brightborn Orientation " is today . I know , that 's why I 'm trying to get Sarah to hustle her way in with Donnie , but she 's ... spending the day with Kira . So , I have to stuff 500 envelopes and cancel my committee meeting on new math . Right , so what were you gonna do in there exactly ? I don 't know , Sarah , things , skulk around , look miserable , con people . OK , you don 't even know what you 're looking for in there . I know the science , I 'll go . Really ? Are you feeling up to it ? Put me in , coach , I 'm ready . - OK , Donnie will pick you up ! - Great . Douglas Andrews , Venture Capitalist , ready for Brightborn Orientation . The plans have changed , Cosima is now carrying your child , Donnie . Oh ! OK . Um ... so wait , is she gonna be co-parenting this child with Julian and I , or is she just gonna be carrying the baby ? Donnie , the baby 's fake , it doesn 't matter . Well , it matters ... to get the story straight . No . Pitter-patter . It ... it matters . - Come on , slow poke ! - Ahem ! Yeah , you 're too fast for me , there , babes ! Ready ? Uncle Felix ! Hello , my little traveler ! Look at you ! Look at this jacket , - it 's brilliant , isn 't it ! - Did you paint all this ? I did , yeah darling , I painted all of them . Ever hear of calling first ? No . S wants you to come to dinner . Is that a rocket ship ? You can call it that . I 've met men who do . Uh ... this Geneconnexion thing , the way you found Adele , it 's connected to Neolution . Oh my God . Oh my God , you 're still on this . I don 't understand . I realize it 's a substantial retainer , Frank . Oh , hi Sarah ! I 'm expensive because I 'm worth it , Frank . Hello ? - Hi ! - Hi . You 're still here . Yeah , I never left . I love this city . It 's adorable . - What 's your name ? - Kira . Oh , hello . - Felix 's real sister . - Real sister , how ? - Uh , we have the same father . - I thought - you didn 't have a father . - Well , I didn 't , but now , I do . Or I did . You know what , it 's a long story . Alright , anyone for mimosas ? So , Why can 't Douglas wear a suit ? 'Cause if you can afford Brightborn , you 're beyond suits . - Uh , beyond Armani ? - Trust me , I know these people , I grew up in Northern California and it 's like the epicenter of obscene wealth , and technological intervention . Douglas is a high net worth individual - who 's pining for a baby . - Oh , hey , I know Douglas . I already played him with Felix . You can 't come in and just change my character . - Okay , Sorry . - Douglas is ... is chill . He 's a chill dude , OK ? - Totally . - I 'm gay , but I 'm not , like , super gay , so ... maybe , don 't play the lesbian angle too much ? I 'm just gonna let that one ... slide . Wow . I look like a geriatric skateboarder . Yeah ! It 's perfect . Alright . Uh , this is you . Alison makes kick-ass I.D. - Ava Jakubowski ? - Mm-hm . I don 't know ... - Good afternoon . - Hi . May I get the names in your conception team , please ? Yes , I 'm Douglas Andrews . Here 's my ... Ah , thank you . Perfect . Thanks . Will your husband Julian be joining us today ? No , Julian is closing a deal in Palo Alto today . But this is our surrogate , Ava ... - Jacket-jet-ski ? - Jakubowski . - Jakubowski . - Jakubowski . - J-A-K ... - Ahem ! Thank you . - Welcome , Ava . - Thanks . We 'll start with our non-disclosure agreements . Just sign where the stickers are . - Can I get a copy of this ? - Uh , once you sign , for sure ! These are your wristbands , and orientation is in the lounge in five . You picked a good weekend . Evie Cho is here in person . Seriously ? Yeah , I 'm in stand-by mode . I can do a sibling DNA test . - Why do you need one ? - Uh , no ... no reason . - Where 's Cosima ? - She 's uh ... out for a walk . I mean , a day-long hike . - Some walking thing . - What ? ! Scott , where is she ? You tell me and I 'll tell you ! Why do you need a sibling DNA test ? 'Cause I 'm trying to figure out if Felix 's bio sister is real or not . OK . Get me hair or saliva samples . And Cosima went undercover into Brightborn . She ... what ? - This place is sweet ! - She co-authored Leekie 's artificial womb project . Creepy shit . OK , well if she 's a high level Neo , won 't she know what a clone looks like ? Blend . - I need to find the lab . - How ? Hello . - Is this your first Brightborn baby ? - Yeah . My son Georgie is two now , and he is just perfect . - Oh yeah ! - Good afternoon , everyone . There 's Evie ! I love her . Thank you . So ... Why are we all here ? Peace of mind , personally . All due respect to natural childbirth . Yes , nature can be cruel . When my parents rolled their genetic dice , a single mutation turned me into " the girl in the plastic bubble " . My immune system was severely compromised , a condition known as SCID . Severe Combined Immunodeficiency . I had pneumonia eight times . I had a bone marrow transplant . The doctors told us this was my life . But the Chos are a fierce and stubborn family . My parents ... they lobbied , researched and mortgaged our home to keep going . In 1994 , I entered an experimental gene therapy trial . By the time I graduated from bio-engineering , I was in full remission . And as an engineer , when I see a flaw , I wanna fix it . First position , heels together . Very nice , perfect ! That is so good ! Aren 't you a bit tall for ballet ? Ha ! Puberty was a real heartbreak . OK . Now , think of your hips as a bowl of fruit , so you don 't wanna tilt one side or the other too much ' cause then , your grapes are gonna go falling out , right ? Alright , so ... second position , remember ? Yeah ! It 's beautiful ! Oh my gosh , you 're so good ! Hm ! Hm ! - You are a very talented dancer . - Thank you ! You 're welcome . Is that why you 're always travelling ? - You on tour ? - I went to go live in Iceland - with my Granny . - In Iceland ? Wow ! I thought your foster family was Irish . Yeah , yeah , Irish travelers and no fixed address . Do you know how to dance like an Irish traveler , huh ? I don 't know ! - Ah , Kira , we gotta go . - Already ? Gotta go see Scotty , check out some comics ! Yeah ? - Good . Sorry , big day . - Bye ! Oh my God ! I 'm late . - I 'm late for my own pregnancy . - That 's fine . - Your name please ? - Christine Wingham . I have heard so much about you guys . I am so excited about my own little Brightborn baby . So , what makes a Brightborn baby different ? And why is it so expensive ? The fees aren 't just for five-star services . They fund research . Our exclusive technology identifies and enhances your most viable embryos . - Enhances your embryos how ? - I have no idea , I 'm ... - fairly lost . - ... can actually help you do that . And that is my cue . Again , welcome to Brightborn . Your child will thank you . Hi , everyone . I 'm Dr. Bosch . Check your wristbands . Red , you 're off for a facilities tour . Blue , stay put . We 're gonna talk about pre and post-natal care and I 'll be able to answer any of your questions . I 'm gonna snoop around - and find the lab , okay ? - Be careful . Legitimately signing my life away here . It 's a lot of paperwork ! I 'm just kidding . But I 'm willing to make that sacrifice . As a mother , it 's worth it . Susan . - Welcome . - Evie , such a beautiful facility you built here . - Ira loves the pool . - Yes . I didn 't know - you were coming too , Ira . - The incident at your dental - clinic is all of our concern . - It was Sarah Manning and her people who killed your technician . Which is what I want to tell you , Susan , I think your runaway clone is here . Sarah Manning 's at Brightborn ? I saw her conning her way into Orientation . - I 'll get Roxie to pick her up . - Not yet . Let me see her first . Nothing . No jaundice , no colic . He sleeps well , latched right away . I gotta say I get a little ... choked up when I come back here . We were ready to adopt , and I 'm sure our family would have been full of love , but wanting a baby , it 's a natural urge . Not just an urge , it 's an imperative . Every living species seeks to propagate . Our genes have a selfish drive to multiply . Would you like to hold him ? Ah , yeah , yeah ! Hey , buddy ! How are ya ? Oh my God , he is so cute ! Look at him and those little dimples ! Hello ! Hello , Mr. Dimples ! Look at him ! - He 's adorable ! - Um ... I have to go ... shit . Salt-water pools , Shiatsu and Swedish massage , body wraps and yoga . Our birthing suites feature squat bars , rocking chairs , jacuzzi tubs and extra rooms for friends and family . I 'm just going to grab a smoothie . Two seconds . - Where are you going ? - I 'll be right there . You have back-to-back C-sections right now . - Yeah , yeah , I know . - Fine , I 'll be down in the lab . Excuse me ! The other floors are off limits . - Are you with a group ? - Uh ... uh , yeah ! Yeah . Thanks ! Detective ! I wanted to show you something . Do you , um ... Do you know what this is ? It says she 's Alison Hendrix . Uncanny , right ? How much ... she looks ... like Beth . - I don 't see it . - Thank you . Maintain that position . You don 't wanna go sticking your neck out for the Hendrixes . - Now , why is that ? - Detective Collier and Lindstein , they have them on the Pouchy Pouchino thing . - The triple homicide ? - Not yet , but they do have them moving Pouchy 's pills . And you know what ? They sold the drugs through a soap store . Bubble bath and shit . Unbelievable , right ? What goes on in the suburbs never ceases to surprise . So ... one cop to another ... Focus on your real family . Your kids , your ex . Let Beth go . You and Cosima , you guys have to fight - all the bad guys . - Is this like the dream that you were telling Cosima about , with the sisters in it ? - No . - No ? So , um , do you wanna talk about anything else , - about your dad , or ... ? - I just wanna play with you . I guess we 'll play ! All right , I 'm assaying 16 key loci , shouldn 't be too long . You want the glass back ? And that 'll confirm that ... Not 100 % , but I should be able to tell if they 're siblings . Sorry . Art , what 's going on ? What the hell are the Hendrixes up to ? I don 't know , what are they up to ? Duko just warned me to steer clear of them . He said they 're dealing pills out of Bubbles . - What ? ! - You know anything about this ? - Come on , no ! - ' Cause I 've looked the other way on a lot of shit for you guys . But if I had dinner in a drug front , I 'm exposed . Oh , I 'll deal with it , - alright ? - Yeah , you do that . You 're on your own on this one . - That doesn 't sound good . - Yeah , um ... Ahem ! Do you guys wanna just play up here for a bit ? And I 'm gonna call Auntie Alison . Please tell me you 're not drug dealers . Former . OK ? Yes , we dabbled briefly in prescription pharmaceuticals , but that 's all done now . And as I recall , when we met , you were trying to offload a kilo of cocaine . That was for Kira . I was desperate ! Yes well , so were we ! We were gonna lose our house , Sarah ! I don 't care about your bloody house . Art 's job is on the line . OK , I get it , you 're mad ! I understand ! But what do the cops know ? - Did Art mention Helena ? - What ... what about Helena ? Hm ... nothing . - Alison , I swear to God ... - She seems to have - disappeared . She 's left . - Left ? Yes , I don 't know . Yesterday or the day before . There 's camping gear missing . Camping gear missing ! Where is she ? I don 't know . Look , I am not your preggo sister 's keeper , OK ? You dumped Helena on us three months ago , only to bring all this crap back on us . You are so self-righteous , you know that ? ! Hello ? - Bitch . - Bitch . Is this seat taken ? Oh , don 't stop reading on my account . We encourage our clients to be diligent . Did you have any questions I might answer ? I 'm Susan , by the way . Ava . Hi . I 'm not a ... lawyer or anything , but ... I ... I just ... noticed that under , um ... cryopreservation , " written notice within 36 months of any remaining embryos " . Does that mean that if I don 't notify my embryos just become property of Brightborn ? You can 't own an embryo . They 're donated for research . What kind of research , exactly ? Oh , it 's all rather technical , actually . Oh ! Oh , sorry . I ... I ... I 'm a ... I was biology major . So , I noticed that in all of the pictures ... Thank you , by the way ... the babies have dimples . It 's highly unlikely for that to express itself in every child . Perhaps babies with dimples are more likely to be photographed . So , it 's my confirmation bias , then ? - Perhaps . - Right . When you say embryonic enhancement , what exactly is that referring to ? Is that mitochondrial transfer ? We have been very successful at eliminating certain genetic risk factors . There 's some kind of screening process , then ? Our technique is more direct . You don 't mean germline editing ? Altering the DNA of an embryo is very risky . Any mistake , and that mutation is passed on - to future generations . - And that is why germline editing is illegal in most countries . - Mum ! - What ? - I tell you my dreams sometimes . - It 's not like that . What 's it like then ? Do you want to talk to S about it instead ? - Adele ! - Oh , hiya , pumpkin ! Heh ! They , uh , just popped round for dinner . - Yeah , I see that . - Thanks for the invitation . Good for you ! Oh , um , Sarah ... OK , earmuffs ... Um , Felix told me about your little immigration issues . I just wanted to say I never was here , in your hideout , all holed up . Not that it 's a hole , it 's lovely . It 's OK . I thought we were taking this whole new - family thing slow , Fee . - Stop , please . - Don 't even start ... - I 'm sorry , did we not agree ? - Stop ! - OK , OK . A word , please . Now ! Fine . They always do this . - There you are ! - Jesus Christ ! - Sorry , sorry ! Listen to me ... - I 've got a key-card ... Great ! Listen to me ! There 's another clone here ! - What ? Who ? - Big blonde hair , perfect nails , Voice like a can opener . - Krystal Goderitch ? Wh .. ? - Who is she ? Why is she at Brightborn ? - Trying to have a baby ? I don 't know ! - She doesn 't even know she 's a clone , dude . She 's gonna screw this all up ! You have to go stop her . Find out what she 's doing and get rid of her , OK ? OK . Wait , how ? How ? ! Ugh ! - ... clean up after me . - It would be great if you could honour the fact that we need a safe house . You agreed not to bring her here and then , you just walked her right in . - It 's a safe house , Fee . - You 're paranoid ! - The two of you , bloody paranoid ! - Kira 's here and we have a right to be suspicious of Adele ! No , you don 't , OK ? 'Cause she 's my sister . I know it in my heart . - Deal with it , Sarah . - I guess we 'll find out . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? I sampled you both . Scott 's doing the DNA test . You poached our DNA ? Hey ! Hey . Uh , can I ... can I help you ? I was looking to ... get a massage . You 're not supposed to be back there , that 's for employees only ... like myself . OK , I 'm just , like ... very tight back here , so ... - Just allow me to ... - Like , right in there . Uh ... Um , we have a schedule here , so ... let me just ... OK , good news , I have an appointment available ... right now , - if you 're interested ? - Great , I 'll take it . OK . It 's with ... myself ... - Ronnie . - OK . Let 's do ourselves a massage . Ah , if you 'll follow me , the room is ... over ... here .. ? There it is ! And if you wanna just take your dress off and just lie on your face , and I will ... be in there . That is not Sarah Manning . That is Cosima Neihaus . Hm ! The self-aware biology student ? - What ? - She 's quite perceptive . Amazing , really ... the innate human drive to know the truth of ourselves . Yes , that 's amazing , Susan but have we forgotten what happened the last time a perceptive clone came poking around my side of things ? - It did not end well . - I know you hate to intervene , Susan , but ... Evie 's right . Yes , I suppose she 's come too far . - Bring her in . - Right away . Yes ? - Are you decent ? - Mm-hmm . I see you 've made yourself comfortable . - Someone seems a little tense . - I am . God , you 're so intuitive . I 'm actually in the healing arts too . Oh , are you a doctor , or ... ? No . I 'm a beautician . So , basically , I help people reveal their true beauty . Basically . Wow , that sounds so wonderful . The hardest people , though , are , like , pregnant women ? 'Cause they 're very self-centered , you know ? Oh , yeah . Moms are like ' no toxins , please ' but I 'm like , 'Mommy has a mustache . Mama needs bleach . ' - Do you know what I mean ? - Mm-hmm . Yeah , you know , I find this whole Brightborn thing kinda creepy ... You don 't even know the half of it . - Can I trust you ? - Of course . Healer to healer . My purse . OK . To tell you the truth , I 'm on a professional investigation right now . Do you know the DYAD Institute ? I don 't think so ... Well , I truly believe that , along with Brightborn , they 're conducting human experiments . Stem cells . In cosmetics . - I 'm sorry , in what ? - There is this woman , and she had stem cell treatment in her face , and every time she blinked , it clicked . Guess why . - I ... I don 't know . - Guess . Um , she ... Because she was growing teeth out of her eyelids . Read it . - Eyelid teeth ? - Yes . And I 'm being personally targeted because I 'm a whistleblower , right ? I 'm like that guy who moved to Russia . And if that French blonde doctor hadn 't saved me , I would be , like , physically dead right now . French doctor . Do you mean Dr. Cormier ? How do you know that name ? Don 't worry . Don 't worry , I 'm actually here to help you , Krystal . - How do you know my name ? - Uh ... - Oh my God , I 'm sorry ... - I 'm sure you are . Come with me , please . Let go of me . - Let 's go . - Ow ! Ow ! What are you doing ? Like , where are you taking me right now ? I didn 't do anything wrong . Excuse me ! Do you talk ? Hello ? ! This isn 't fair ! I didn 't do ... I didn 't do anything ! Hello ! No , OK ? This isn 't right . I know you can hear me . Fine , I stole these , OK ? I 'm sorry , I 'm a beauty professional , I 'm interested in the trade . - Evie , that 's Krystal Goderitch . - I 'm sorry , - who 's Krystal Goderitch ? - Krystal is a naive subject . I 'll speak with security , get them to track down the right leader . She has some delusions about her circumstance , but she 's harmless . I just came here to have , like , a baby . No ! Let me go ! No ! I can 't ! I can 't do it ! Well , I feel like a zit . It 's kind of weird , right , me just popping up out of the blue ? You totally don 't have anything to apologize for , OK ? You 're just a little , uh , unexpected . Plus I 'm a total disaster . Ever since my daddy died , I 've just been , like ... ah ! Like , off the rails . I 'd probably think - I was after Fee 's money or something . - Thankfully , no problem there . So , is it expensive , " GeneConnexion " ? - Sorry ? - GeneConnexion , the way you found Felix . - Chicken ... - Is that quite expensive ? - What ? - No , no , it 's cheap . Everyone 's doing it . Spit in a cup and mail it off . I don 't know that everyone 's comfortable coughing up their genetic profile to a corporation . Can you back off ? That better not be contraband food I see there . To your room . Go on , get going . OK , Tabitha , I 'm going to need a urine sample from you ... - Can I have Denelle 's OR slot ? - Gimme a break . - She sounded pretty far along . - Do you want to get paid ? Yeah , it 's just it 's my son 's birthday this weekend . - I was supposed to be done by now . - Honey , you know you can 't leave , you 'll be disqualified from the study . Come on , let 's get to the washroom . - Hello ! - Hello ! I think I only have three faces . - Hey , so why GeneConnexion ? - This again ? Well , there 's a lot of other companies that do it . I don 't know . Maybe the commercials ? - " GeneConnexion ... " - " Your Family Finders ! " Yeah . I didn 't really know what it meant , though , until I saw Felix 's face for the first time . Aw . I was expecting a Republican with big hair . What 's a Republican ? Oh , sweetheart , let 's not give you nightmares . Kira , you 're finished , so come on over . Take your plate . You can help me do dessert . Go easy . Yeah , nothing 's ever easy with you , though , is it , Sarah ? I guess not . Are you the arsehole , or is it that thing in your face ? So , did you submit your DNA first , or did Felix ? Sarah , I 'm sorry I 'm such an albatross for you . I love my new brother . - I just don 't believe that . - Really . - No . - I should just go . - No , you know what ? I think you should stay . - Maybe you should go . - Felix ! - What ? Come on ! What age are you ? Hey , Scott . Yeah . Oh , OK . Yeah . Yeah , thanks . OK . Sorry , Adele . I had you and Felix genetically tested . I thought we already did that . Yeah . Yeah , you did . She 's my sister , isn 't she ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , she is . Yeah . May we be excused ? Yes , love , of course you can . It 's OK . Right , well , guess this meal 's over . Sit down . Finish your dinner . Welcome to the family . - Shit , sorry . - Thank you . We 've got a carrier fully dilated . Gimme a hand . Come on . Oh God , I want to push . - Not yet . - Oh , please ! - They promised it would be a C-section ! - Too late for that now . She 's fully dilated , plus one . Can you call the OB ? Doctor 's such an ass . I bet he went to get a smoothie . Hey , I 'm on the carrier ward , floor west . With Denelle . Batch 42 . We need an OB . Let 's get her onto her side . Hey , it 's OK . It 's OK , just breathe , OK ? We apologize greatly ... You 're gonna hear from my lawyer about this . Sure , and you are more than welcome to ... Do you employ him here ? - Miss Williams , stay calm . - That face ? - I have seen that face before . - Things are OK . I thought it was Braxton Hicks . - The contractions were mild and regular . - Not anymore . She 's fully dilated , plus two . Slide down the bed for me , Denelle . - My mom said this was wrong . - Grab her legs . There 's meconium . Call the recess team . Yeah , I need a recess team for a mec delivery . Floor east . Oh , God ! Oh God , forgive me ! - The head 's coming . - God forgive me . One more big push . That 's it . One more . Last push ! He 's out ... Shit . Positive for B.P. syndrome , orofacial clefts , ectodermal anomalies , severe popliteal webbing . Cosima ? Remember me ? Susan . Duncan ... Perhaps we should discuss why you 're really here . I finally meet my maker and this is what you 're doing ? You 're allowing emotions to cloud your judgment . - Think like a scientist . - Brightborn has identified genes that eliminate dozens of childhood illnesses . These are human beings that you 're tinkering with . Trial and error - without consent . - These carriers are very well compensated . And does that justify the baby that I saw ? Evie , give us the room . I 'm sorry . It is a passionate subject for all of us . How can you even support this ? You don 't even know the long-term effects of it . Look at me , I 'm sick . - I never gave permission for any of this . - No one gives permission to be born . I created you as a beautiful baseline , to unlock the mysteries of the human genome . We 're your Oncomice . And you 've seen the alternative . The carriers , the device in Sarah ... these are brutish techniques compared to Leda . We 're not giving you Kendall so you can make more lab rats . Cosima , you 're dying . And you know that you don 't have the resources to save yourself . But share the Original 's genome , and together we can make a cure , for all of you . Sorry I ruined dinner . We still had a really fun day . Mommy ... Your sisters ... I know how they feel sometimes . How do you mean ? Like ... Cosima , when she 's sad . Helena , when she 's lonely . Rachel 's the angriest . There 's even some I don 't know . I 'm sorry , monkey , I didn 't understand . Those aren 't dreams . So ... what are they ? I don 't know , monkey . I wish I did . I feel you too , Mommy . It 's up to them now . Were you able to reason with her ? We are as close to the Original as we have ever been . To a cure . Yes , my love .

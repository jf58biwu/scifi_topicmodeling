Butterflies all havin ' fun You know what I mean Sleep in peace when day is done That 's what I mean And this old world is a new world And a bold world for me Stars , when you shine You know how I feel Scent of the pine You know how I feel Oh , freedom is mine And I know how I feel It 's a new dawn It 's a new day It 's a new life for me Yes , it 's a new dawn It 's a new day It 's a new life for me And I 'm feeling good And I 'm feeling good This is totally fascinating . The last woman in England to be imprisoned for witchcraft was during World War II , because she somehow knew about a boat that had been sunk . She described it as if she 'd been on it . I never really pictured you as one those people that believes in all this psychic stuff . Oh , my mom 's always been into it . Well , we become our parents . First scary thought of the day . And first scary face . Agent Bendix . What an unpleasant surprise . - Amanita Caplan . - Shall I fill in my answers now ? I don 't know . I 'm not sure . I don 't recall . And Australia . The problem is ... I don 't believe you . Well , I believe the rich should pay more taxes , which means believing in something doesn 't make it so . Let 's cut the bullshit . I know you 've been in contact with Ms. Marks . - You know it because I told you I was . - Recently . Nomi said you would still be illegally reading our texts . It 's not illegal if you 're a wanted felon . But I am not a wanted felon and since you don 't have her phone number , that must mean you 've been illegally reading my texts . It is a crime to assist a felon . How would you know I was assisting unless you yourself were committing a felony ? I didn 't come here to play games . I came to promise you this : If I don 't put Ms. Marks behind bars , I will put you there . One thing you should know about me , Amanita ... I keep my promises . God , what a douche . - Tell me about it . - Are you okay ? Probably need a shower when I get home . And some Mission Chinese ? Hey . I thought you said no context of where we were . That 's just on the cell . I bounce that signal from Australia . This is a closed network . It 's safe . Safe ? That word seems to mean something different all the time . The police are wrong . He didn 't kill himself . It was shame . Shame killed our father . At least ... we still have each other . Hey ! That 's government property . You want another two weeks ? Another two weeks . Feels like I 'm hitting a wall . I really made a mess of things this time . I don 't know . I was trying to fix everything . I think I just fucked it all up . I know you 'd say that 's what I always do . Maybe it 's true . Maybe I do fuck everything up . But this time ... this time it 's cost me the only thing I 've ever really wanted . - Hey , Capheus ! - Hmm ? I 've been thinking ... why don 't we hire one of those real good artists like Mozee to paint Jean-Claude this time ? That guy 's expensive . I know , but this comeback has to be legendary . The Van Damn is back . Badder than ever ! We need to make a statement . - Ah , have you seen the Go-bama ? - Hmm ? Ooh ! That thing is sick ! I mean , it looks just like him . People care about that shit . Face is important . - You think so ? - Yeah . I don 't know . Jean-Claude doesn 't look the same as he did . Neither does Obama . Hmm . I 'll bet the Go-bama used Hope Obama and not Now Obama . Yeah , yeah . No one wants a wrinkly gray-haired dude on their bus . Exactly . Faces change , you know ? But not the heart . True that . True that . To be legends ... we need a heart like Jean-Claude or Obama more than we need their face . - Yeah ? Then next stop ? - Hmm ? - Legendary ! - Aah ! Speaking of faces ... I must say , you 're looking a little different these days . - New barbershop . - Oh . - You 're looking good . Very good . - Yes ! Thank you . Art is material . It is wed intractably to the real world , bound by matter and matters . Art is political . Never more so than when insisting it is not . Art is dialectic . It is enriched when shared and impoverished by ownership and commodification . It is a language of seeing and being seen . Uh , would someone care to fill me in on the joke here ? Yes . Totally . Is this art , Mr. Fuentes ? Is it art , Mr. Valles ? What do you think ? Why don 't you tell us what you see ? Looks like shit-packer porn . " Shit-packer porn . " That is ... That is very interesting . Yeah . 'Cause this is where the relationship between subject and object reverses . The proverbial shoe shifting to the other foot . And what was seen ... now reveals the seer . Because the eyes of the beholder find not just beauty where they want , but also shallowness , ugliness , confusion ... prejudice . Which is to say the beholder will always see what they want to see , suggesting that what you , Mr. Valles , want to see is in fact shit-packer porn . Whereas someone else ... someone with a set of eyes capable of seeing beyond societal conventions , beyond their defining biases , such a beholder might see an image of ... two men caught in an act of pleasure . Erotic to be sure , but also ... vulnerable . Neither aware of the camera . Both of them connected to the moment , to each other . To love . And as I have suggested before in this class ... art ... is love made public . Joaquin kept his word . It 's ... It 's all over the Internet . I am sorry ... - No . - About all this . I ... It was worth it just to hear you describe it . So ... Here we go . Here we go . You were a cop ? I am a cop . I was an ecologist . I used to be able to see ... so much beauty in the world . And now all I can see is what he sees . I thought I was safe here . But he found me . Just like he 'll find you . But don 't worry . I have a secret . A way out . Somewhere where we can go where nobody can find us . What is it ? What is it ? It 's him ? - Is it him ? - It was her . - Angelica ? - Angelica . Yes . It 's okay . You 're safe . You 're safe . Ah , Ms. Bak . Hello . Please have a seat . - Who are you ? - I 'm Mr. Lee . Mr. Chen sends his apologies , but he 's unable to continue your case . Why ? Conflict of interest . Was he threatened ? So ... why are you here ? I believe in the law , and the law has failed you . You do not belong in here and I 'm gonna get you out . Has the court agreed to a re-trial ? No . Without your father 's testimony to authenticate the new documents ... they have rejected the appeal . This is the law you believe in ? I 'm going to subpoena your brother . Stay away from Joong-Ki . He is more dangerous than you think . And when I get out , I want him where I can reach him . What 's up , Neets ? - Heading to work ? - Late shift . That guy Bendix was here again . Unbelievable . They don 't imprison a single banker for stealing billions of taxpayer dollars . Instead they come after us . Welcome to America . How is she ? Handling it better than most . I 'd go crazy trapped in that little room all day . You and me both . You know I heard that . Oh , shit . I thought I turned it off . You should leave it on . It 'll give you a sense of what I 'm going through . I could handle you , but all those other voices ? I 'd have lobotomized myself by now . I 'm kind of getting the hang of it . Lito can be a bit of a handful sometimes . Drama queen ? Definitely . You know I heard that . Oh , shit . - Oh , no . Is it Lito ? - Yeah . Uh-oh . See you in a sec . Hey . Why is it when I feel scared , I end up with you ? I don 't know . I 'm such a chicken compared to most of the others . I 'm worried for you . I hope that what I said to you at the museum didn 't make you do something you didn 't want to do . No . No . What you said was important to me . I needed you to say it . But it doesn 't make what is going to happen any easier . If you need anything ... Thank you . I know I can be a bit ... dramatic . But really , when you came out , did you have to deal with anything like this ? No . I ... I know something 's wrong . I feel ... trapped here . Is it the villa , or is it Positano ? We can go somewhere else . It 's not a place . It 's a feeling . Are you , uh ... feeling trapped by me ? - By this marriage ? - No , I ... No . Um ... What 's trapping you ? If I were to try and explain it to you , you would think I 'm actually crazier than I sound . Try me . Okay . Okay , fine . For starters , there are people , people that I feel connected to all over the world that are innocent and yet they 're locked up in prison . And they are trapped by circumstance ... or by things that have happened in the past . And then there are people without the privilege that we have and they feel threatened because they love a person who the world has decided that they shouldn 't love . It 's wrong . Terrible . Kala , Kala ... I think I know what 's going on . You do ? I , uh ... talked to your mother . You did not tell her that we haven 't had sex yet . I did . I mean , I needed some guidance . You asked my mother if I was a ... Kala , I now recognize that this was inappropriate . - Inappropriate ? - I 'm supposed to pretend I 'm not up ... - set ? ! - Am I supposed to pretend this is okay ? Hey . Hey , calm down . Okay ? - I hate ... - that word . - I hate that ... - word . They 're trying to provoke us . They want us to be upset by it . Of course I 'm upset ! But if you don 't mind , maybe you can explain one thing to me . Why is it even news ? Who gives a fuck who I fuck ? This is the 21st century , people . Get over it ! This is insane . You can 't go out there . Fuck these pirañas ! Come to my house . You took me in . Let me help you . Rajan , we may be married , but my body is mine . It is not a field of land to be purchased and plowed . It is not for you or my mother to gossip about . Kala ! God , woman , you 're a force of nature . I 've been an ass . Please , just forgive me . I was insecure . I know there were a lot of issues . The travel and other things . But I began to wonder that , if now that the wedding was over ... - you were still having second thoughts . - No . I told you they were done . And they are . The more bullets I find , the more impossible it looks . We were very lucky . Come on , I know luck . And this ? It 's not luck . I get that some things are difficult for people to talk about , but when I think about the fact that we haven 't talked about that day , - it gets me a little upset . - Why ? You 're a damn good driver . You are a loyal son . You 're even half a decent mechanic , if I 'm here to instruct you . However ... I 've known you since you were ten years old . And one thing you 're not , Mr. Van Damn , is a genius of martial arts . It 's me . Jela . Come on , what happened that day with the Superpower ? Look , I know it 's going to sound crazy , but ... a spirit . You sure you want to tell him ? - Maybe it 's time . - What 's time ? The spirit . She 's here . Good to see you . Where is this spirit from ? - She lives in Seoul . - Korea ? She 's a businesswoman . My age exactly . Born the same moment I was . The first breath I took , she took too , but in Korea . What a thing , yeah ? She 's here now ? Sort of . - Actually , she 's in prison . - Prison . Why is she in prison ? It 's complicated . The sad part is that while she was there , her father was murdered . Does she know that your father was murdered ? We have many things in common . Why did the spirit pick you ? That is a mystery I can 't explain . But I will always be grateful for . Me , too . I know we live in our little bubble world in this city , but , I mean , when I look at those pictures of Lito and Hernando , I think , " That 's hot . " Mmm ! So hot . I just don 't get it . Why can 't the rest of the world see what we see ? I don 't know . But they 're in a safe place now . Mmm ! Salud ! You 're nervous . Someone 's been following me . Police ? Cops made it clear they didn 't give a shit about the shooting . Sounds like cops . If you need help ... I 'm fine . If you need some air ... I 'm good . It 's not what you think . Jonas . - Daddy ? - Hmm ? Can we go see the swans ? Of course . Did you know swans mate for life ? That 's his daughter . Fancies himself quite the family man . Loves pretending to be one of them . You 're not the first one to try to hide in the corner of his mind , waiting for him to make a mistake . The heroin helps , doesn 't it ? The connection feels vague . He 's usually meticulous with his pills , which means he 's made a mistake or ... he wants us to see this . Stratford ? Maybe Cambridge . What are the pills ? We call them blockers . Cuts you off from the psycellium . Temporarily turns us into them . Keeps hunters like him protected ... and prisoners like me isolated . You hear that ? It 's the blocker dissolving the connection . Where are you ? BPO has pits all over the world to throw us into . We know BPO is receiving funding from governments all over the world , but we have very little on who they actually are . Of course not . This is an organization responsible for hunting and controlling what they see as a very dangerous species . They 're afraid of us . So you and your cluster must be very careful . How many hunters are there like Whispers ? No one is like him . But there are others , collaborators , networks of recruiters working for BPO . I keep having visions ... of Angelica . I keep seeing her in a ... in a cabin . The cabin . First place I ever considered a home . But I 've never been there . How can I see that ? A genetic birth transfers genes . A sensate birth transfers sense experience and memory . You are Angelica 's children , so parts of her consciousness still echo in you . We weren 't her first cluster ? No . What happened to them ? The same thing that 's happened to me . And that in all probability is going to happen to you . Sadly , they 've realized I 'm visiting . Shit ! Wait , wait . What about Whispers ? He must have been born into a cluster . They 're all dead . In his sleep , he still talks to them . He 's coming . Go ! This is incredible . 9 / 11 , World Trade Center , planes hit . This guy was guided out of the building by a vivid physical presence . Wow . - This guy , Kolovi ... - He 's the professor in Chicago ? Right . He cites Freud 's theory of pre-language communication and suggests the psychic synaptic field would explain a lot of things . Like how inventions and scientific breakthroughs happen at the same time all over the world . Has your mom contacted her anthropologist friend ? - She 's setting up a meeting . - Good . Because the more I read , the more I 'm starting to believe this . Me , too . Spanner . - You believe in miracles ? - You know I do . Feast your eyes on the comeback of the century ! They thought that he was done , that no one could come back from that kind of a beating . They forgot one thing ... Van Damn always comes back ! Whoo ! Wham ! Bam ! Here comes the Van Damn ! Muscles from Brussels never dies . Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes , yes , yes ! Hey ... - Hey , hey ... - Wait ... Wait , wait , wait . - Hey ! Whoa ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! - Whoa , whoa ! I never thought I 'd say this , but I think the king is dead . Hey . Five minutes . Soo-Jin . We all chipped in and then bribed the guard . Why ? Because I knew it was your birthday . You shouldn 't be alone . Come sit . Okay . Happy birthday . Happy birthday , Van Damn ! What ? My God ! How do you find all these places ? Touring . My friend Vincent owns it . I had one of the best shows of my life and I celebrated staying here . - Vincent ... - He 's the one helping us with the drugs . Should I be jealous ? Only if it makes you want me more . It 's your birthday . I promised you a sex-nic . Oh , I so need a sex-nic , but you promised before I became a fugitive . I 'm a woman of my word . And besides , are we really gonna let Agent Bent-dick ruin all our fun ? Hell , no . Happy Birthday . What ... ? Such a naughty boy . I picked it out myself . This is from me . Oh , my God ! Oh , my ... Oh , my God ! Mr. Kabaka , I can 't accept this . I just want to honor the gift you gave to me and my family . This is a very small thing compared to that . Oh , my goodness ! Ohhhh ! Oh ... Oh , my ... ! I mean , look at this ! Are you kidding me ? You said she was a Jindo . I thought she could keep you company . Thank you . Don 't let your head hang low You 've seen the darkest skies I know Let your heart run , child Like horses in the wild So take my hand and home we 'll go Ow ! - Sorry . - Just kidding . Feeling warm as a burning coal Let your soul shine bright Like diamonds in the sky - Perfect . - Yeah ? Can you hear the music ? Yeah ... It sounds like a radio that keeps changing stations . I know . Mmm . We did agree that I shouldn 't visit unless it was an emergency . This is more than an emergency . We shared our first breath . Now it 's time to celebrate that breath ... together . Whoo ! Home we 'll go Home we 'll go - It is my birthday ! - Lito ! My friends . Tonight , we 're gonna dance . La , la , la , la La , la , la , la , la - Have a good time - Ready to just go You gotta give me something And I 'll give you something back La , la , la , la La , la , la , la We 're gonna huff and puff and blow the house down ... Oh , so nice , play it twice Twice , twice , twice , twice ... Get your , get your hands up - Get your , get your hands up - Hey . Can I play with you ? Anything is possible in Positano . Yeah , go ahead . Get your , get your , get your Get your hands up - That was fun . - It was . I don 't know why I 'm here . I think we all know how this works by now . Do we ? It works very inconsistently for me . That is a beautiful necklace . I , um ... Rajan threw me a beautiful party . And tonight , uh ... Tonight , we 're going to ... Have sex . Uh ... Yeah . When I 'm in the ring ... there are times when my body moves without me telling it to . It moves without me thinking , " I should do this , I shouldn 't do that . " It moves in harmony to the moment . The first time something like that happened , I was 17 . I was invited to a major tournament . My final opponent was a boy named Woojin . He was a smart and skilled fighter . But my father was in the audience . I believed if I won , my father would let me compete in the Nationals . But it had the opposite effect . After the fight , my father forbade me from ever fighting again . You are the best fighter I have ever fought in my life . It was an honor to be in the ring with you . I learned more about myself and about Woojin in that locker room than if I had fought him a hundred times . We exist ... because of sex . It 's not something to be afraid of . It 's something to honor . To enjoy . Everywhere is freaks and hairies Dykes and fairies Tell me where is sanity Tax the rich , feed the poor Till there are no rich no more I 'd love to But I don 't know what to do So I 'll leave it up to you Oh But I don 't know what to do But I don 't know what to do Oh But I don 't know what to do Whoa Oh , oh-oh-oh But I don 't know what to do So I 'll leave it up to you But I don 't know what to do - Is that you ? - Yeah . What are you drinking ? Champagne . - Perfect . - Why ? - It 's my birthday . - Oh , lucky me . Let 's go . Looks good . Yeah , okay . Oh , my God ! Hi . What are you doing ? You just appeared . I figured you wanted it . Of course I want it ! Give it to me ! No , this is immoral . What ? My wife ! There aren 't words that could make me happier . - Make love to me . - Except for those . - Okay . - Okay . No . No ! - That was you . You did this . - You did too ! - Did what ? - Never mind . - I 'm not going to watch this . - Well , maybe you should . - Uh , should what ? - Be quiet . - I 'm silent . - Enjoy yourself , Mrs. Rasal . Oh , I intend to ! Can you please be more respectful ? Yes ! Yes ! Slap it ! - She likes it . - Oh , I do ! I do ! I can hear you . Stop listening . Kala . - I can 't . I can 't . - What ? Kala ! Oh , no ! Oh ! Oh , my God ! What happened ? What happened , baby ? - What happened ? - I think it snapped ! I think it snapped ! Oh , my God ! Oh , it 's broken ! I 'll call the ambulance ! Just hold on ! I mean , all we have is an image problem on our hands , Lito . What matters most is everybody understands that that disgraceful picture is a violation of your privacy . No one can prove it 's even real . It 's obviously doctored , that picture . The reprobate who posted it online is going to regret it . We will sue him to high heaven and then back to hell . Gonna teach this country you don 't question the manhood of their heroes . Capiche ? I 'm ... I love you guys . You 've been very good to me . But I can 't live a lie anymore . You can 't what ? Is that a line from a movie ? You 're an actor . You get paid to live lies . Come on . The audience is not legally entitled to truth . This is who I am . Okay ? And I ... I don 't want to deny it . I 'm gay . I 'm gay . Okay . We get it . - But there will be consequences . - Legal consequences . Career consequences . Fuck consequences . Fuck consequences . Buongiorno . Buongiorno , doctor . So , how are you doing ? Much better . Well , you 've dodged a bullet , eh ? I don 't see this often , I have to say . A phantom fracture . " Phantom " ? Yes . It 's good news . Rupture of the superficial dorsal vein . Not a true fracture . A sprain is all . A bit of rest and you 'll be out and able to enjoy your vacation . Honeymoon . We 're here on our honeymoon . Oh . Well , it could have been far worse , huh ? Count your blessings . Hopefully we will have no complications . Comp ... Complications ? Yes . Penile problems . Oh , my Ganesha . Painful intercourse , painful erection , erectile dysfunction . But it 's looking good . I 'm not expecting any problems . Is there anything I can do to aid the recovery ? Well , your husband needs love . You 're just married . Love cures all ills . Well , most . Well , some . Good luck , hmm ? - Thank you , doctor . - Have a good day . You 'll be fine . Don 't worry , I think everything will be fine . - Are you okay ? - Please don 't . Your love causes pain . Sugar ? Why are you here , Auntie ? I don 't know everything that happened in your past , but I 'm aware my husband made his choices . And you made him pay for them . So are you here to forgive me or make me pay ? One day I suspect you will pay a price for your choices , as my husband and his son paid for theirs . But , rest assured , the finger on the trigger will not be mine . As you know , over 20 years , your Uncle Sergei amassed a portfolio of business and property interests throughout East Berlin . I 've come equipped with a ... a map of the city , if I may ? Berlin is presently divided into four major territories . I call them " kingdoms . " Nice dynastic ring to it , no ? The kingdom of the west , run by Volker Bohm , I 've marked in blue . To the south , dominated by Khalil Dogan , is in yellow . Sebastian Fuchs controls the north . And your late uncle 's kingdom is red . As a consequence of , uh ... recent events , the east is without leadership , a situation that will not last much longer . Am I supposed to care ? By killing your uncle , you didn 't just out-Hamlet Hamlet . You might have pitched the city into a war . But I am in negotiation with Volker and the other kings . I believe it is not too late . You can still stop the war from happening . How ? By coming home . Your presence will calm everything . It will forestall more unnecessary bloodshed . Why ? Because to me , to him , to anyone who understands this map ... you are still a Bogdanow . Thanks for the tea . He found you , Will . This is how Angelica wasted the end of her life . Is that your plan ? Killing yourself with a needle in some abandoned squat in Iceland ? Oh , no . It 's not that easy . You have no idea where we are . We could be anywhere . I could care less where you are , Will . What I care about is how you are . Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately ? You want to help me ... Milton ? Just tell me where you are . Well , I 'm right here , Will . Same place we are . Nowhere . There are standard procedures for bringing in a new sensate . You 're a cop , Will . You understand procedure . I do . I 've been on that side of the table . I know what you wanna do . You want to keep me talking long enough ... hoping I 'll reveal something about where we might be . I could do the same ... hoping you might tell us something about your beautiful wife . I 'm not wearing a ring , Will . No . But you are wearing a tan line , meaning you removed it before you walked in here and that you had a holiday recently . And being someone who knows something about these kind of organizations , I would bet you were asked to take a voluntary leave after you fucked up in Iceland . Huh ? You 're making a choice , Will . A choice that will have consequences that will affect not just you . The pain will be felt by everyone you are connected to . Your partner , your friends on the force ... your father . And of course ... Ms. Gunnardottir . Are you ready for that ? Is it him ? You need a shot ? She reminds me of Angelica . Beautiful creatures that you know are too fragile for this world . When Angelica put the gun in her mouth , I wondered ... what was the thought that finally made her pull the trigger ? If Riley comes to the same end ... do you think her last thought will be of you ... or of me ? Angelica couldn 't bear the weight of her choices . Do you really think you 're any different ? I was thinking about my mom . Remember her ? There was this one night ... he was gone drinking and we were alone . She told me ... that she had a secret inside of her . That I was once a secret . And that secrets are better than love , because they kept people together . Your mother was crazy as cat shit . You 're awake ? If I had to hear one more of your confessions , I was going to kill myself . Ow ! Sorry ! Oh , fuck . I missed you so much , brother . - I need a beer . - Okay . [ in English Last stop ! Everybody out ! Downtown Nairobi . Everybody out ! Everybody out ! Faster , faster , faster , faster , faster ! Faster , faster , faster , faster ! - Not bad , partner . Not bad . - Mmm ! - Hey ! Hello . - Yes ? - Mwisho . End of the road . - This is the end of our route . - We know . - What are you doing then ? - Waiting for you to go back . - Go ... - Why ? - I had told my friend I was afraid to quit my job . And then I rode your bus , and I am no longer afraid . - Yeah ? No . - Is this a joke ? - No , I swear . - It is no joke . We heard how the spirit of Jean-Claude guided you and protected you . And helped you kick the ass of Superpower . And now we 're hoping the spirit of Jean-Claude can help us . And we can take care of that . Can you take care of that ? What ? Everything okay ? Code 's not working . Hello , Lito ! Mr. Sicaro ! Good morning ! My door code isn 't working . We had it changed . Had it changed ? We sent a letter . - Where ? - Your apartment . But how am I supposed to get a letter if I cannot get into my apartment ? I 'm sorry , Lito . Have a nice day ! Bye ! Mr ... What happened ? - He 's not answering . - Call him again . He has to answer . I 'm calling him ! He 's not answering ! No , call him again ! Call him again . He has to answer . He works there . Call him again , please . - He was the nice one . - He was the nice guy . He was . - You said he was the nice one . - He was the nice guy . - This is not right . - Lito , wait . Lito ... - What are you gonna do ? - Please . - Give me some space . Please . - What are you gonna do ? - No ! Wait , Lito ! - Wait ! Lito ! Lito ! Hey ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm all right ! Give me that . No , Lito ! Lito , what are you ... What are you gonna do ? Holy shit , Lito ! Where did you learn how to do that ? I was a burglar . In The Devil Died at Dawn . Also an assassin . And a toreador . I remember . You were great . Oh , you 're my hero ! - Good to see you . - You , too . Rajan ? Rajan ? There you are . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Did the doctor have some bad news ? No , he gave me a clean bill of health . But this is good news . You know , those are the siren islands . I always thought the myth was about Odysseus or the sailors . No one writes much about the sirens . About why they sing , what they want . Rajan ... are you going to tell me why the bags are packed ? It 's big , but ... What 's wrong , baby ? Ay ... They can 't just do this . They can 't just take our stuff . This is Mexico . The sad truth is I 've seen worse . " Due to violations of Tenant Occupancy " as well as proven instances of grave moral turpitude and in accordance to the Condominium Association 's bylaws , Articles 69 and 70 , the Owners ' Council has unanimously decided to cancel the lease . " Eviction procedures to be initiated immediately . " Whenever I wanted something , I focused everything on that goal ... usually refusing to hear or see anything but what I wanted . And I 've never wanted anything like I wanted you . I 've been so blind that I couldn 't see the most obvious thing : That how I felt about you was not the same as how you felt about me . That 's ... But if I 'm anything , I 'm optimistic . Which made me realize that it 's not too late for either of us to come to a quick decision to ... Rajan , please , don 't say anything more . Right now , let us not make any decisions . Whatever happens tomorrow , we will let the fates decide . But what happens right now ... what happens for the rest of this night ... please ... let me decide . - Teagan emailed . - Your sister ? - She 's getting married . - That 's great ! She wants me to be her maid of honor . Aww ! That 's beautiful ! Except that I 'm a fugitive and even if I did try to go , my own parents would probably be the first ones to turn me in . That 's true . The signal ! This room is occupied by Maria but she 's at work . Tartine . But , uh ... no thank you . Watch her . What 's up ? I knew it was fucking Bent-Dick . Excuse me . This is a fugitive warrant for Nomi Marks . We have solid information that she and her girlfriend are currently residing in this shelter . I haven 't seen Nomi for months . Either you tell me where they are or I head straight downtown and I talk to every grant office , every politician I can , to shut this place down . They are not here . I wanted to come back first thing ... because if I didn 't ... I knew I would never walk through that door again . I 've been thinking a lot about that day . I said it was our revolution . I forgot in revolutions people get shot . I 'm not you , Wolfie . I 'm not Conan . I 'm just a sidekick . From Wuppertal . What are you talking about ? Huh ? Maybe it 's time to go home .

These guys are the worst liars I 've ever seen in my life . They 're killers . Who hired you ? I think you know who . He wanted you to know that he has never been the forgiving type .

You don 't belong in a shitty apartment . Are you insulting my home ? I mean no offense . I 've come here as one who understands your worth .

There are government agents saying all kinds of fucked-up shit about you . Dad , don 't ... don 't believe them . Don 't believe them . It 's not true . If it 's not true , good . We got nothing to worry about . Why can 't you tell me what 's going on ? Because it 's about Sara , Dad . Oh , no . - Dad , you gotta believe me . - No . Ah , fuck . It 's not just ... It 's more than just her , okay ? - Will ... - You 've gotta believe me . You need help . - You need to get home . - Are you drinking ? - What do ... What do you care ? - You 're not supposed to be drinking . You 're not here ! Four months ! Four fucking months ! - I don 't know if you 're dead or alive ! - I gotta go . You 're not here ! - Bye , Dad . - Wait a minute . No . Willie . Willie . - Please ? - I love you . You gotta get home . - Son ... - I can 't . I 'm not saying he can 't do it . I 'm just thinking out loud , or in your head ? Or whatever I 'm doing . I 'm just wondering , do we need to consider another strategy ? Right now , Will is our strategy . And that is enough for me . Is it time ? Are you sure you wanna do this ? Because we don 't have to do this . We could ... talk about something ? Anything ? Like how we 're working on a hack of the prison transfer system to get you out of there . No , I have to watch it . I just don 't want it to upset you . - I will not be upset . - It 's just that this is a new laptop and ... No , I will not be upset . Again . Okay . Welcome to Smart Money . Our guest today is Joong-Ki Bak , CEO of Bak Industries . So let me set the stage . Bak Industries looked like it was on its last legs , first wrecked by embezzlement and scandal , and the death of your father , who began the company 25 years ago . It was a terrible loss . - Hey . - Hey . - Is that ... ? - It 's started . Is she gonna bust your laptop again ? You are the proverbial Phoenix from the ashes . To what do you attribute your amazing success ? Well , uh ... - I didn 't know she could speak Korean . - Nom 's full of surprises . Buddy ! ... fresh start , a rebranding . So you feel the company has fully recovered from your sister 's actions ? I understand she attacked you when you tried to visit her . My sister is troubled . But she 's still my family and ... I love her . People can change . And it 's my hope that prison will help her become the kind of person that our father would be proud of . Sorry . Ooh ! Oh , my God ! I have never seen snow ! Wow ! Ah , just give it a few days , when the oil and the soot and the dirt turns it into a mess . Why do you have to do that ? Do what ? Ruin everything . I don 't know . It 's my nature ? - No , it isn 't . - No ? You have something good ... and beautiful hidden inside of you . Just as I have something dark and wicked inside of me . We 're perfect for each other . No . Why ? Because we have to change . Become better people . What if I don 't want to change ? You do . You know what I want ? Yes . I 'm afraid I do . Oh , shit ! I 'm a badass motherfucker . Wolfgang ! Wolfgang ! What the fuck are you on ? And where can I get some ? - Check it out . - Neets , come on ! - We 're gonna be late . - One sec ! What is this ? Evil Santa . I don 't know about this , Riley . Oh , come on . He has a family . He won 't be looking for you tonight . I would if I were him . We have to have one night that we 're not afraid of him . - Felix , you better go inside . - Come on . I can 't get shot again . I just came out of the hospital . That would be terrible plotting . Going to Grace 's ? I love her to pieces but her idea of Christmas is like a triathlon . Christmas Kitchen for the homeless , children 's hospital , then home for dinner . Finally , midnight Queer Choir . Sounds intense . Oh , my God , Lito ! This is beautiful ! You bought this for your mother ? Yeah . She , more than anyone , always believed in me . With the check from my first big movie , I wanted to tell her thank you . Wow ! What is this for ? A token of my respect and gratitude . You did this city a huge service and it was high time someone said thank you . - Ready ? - Yeah . What ? What ... ? - Ice-skating . - Yeah . - I don 't know how to ice-skate . - Yes , you do . Because I do . Wow ! Kala , what 's all this ? I felt like celebrating . I usually just hang with the virts . Virts ? You know , virtual family , online community ? We 're all pretty tight . Though we don 't actually know each other . Well , that 's not true . In some ways , they know more about me than anybody . But we 've never actually met , you know , physically . - Make sense ? - Yeah . Hey ... whatever happens , I want you to know that I am here . Okay . Come on . Let 's X-mas ! - You look amazing ! - I know , right ? You coming ? Really ? Yeah . Okay . Mama ? Mama ? Mama ? I always save your clippings . The good , the bad and the inevitable . - Mama ... - This wasn 't the hard part . And it wasn 't the friends thrusting the pictures in my face with their sincerest condolences . I never had so many friends call . Who knew I was so popular ? Dear friends , dear colleagues , dear all : Now that my famous movie-star son is here , let me thank each and every one of you for showing me your true colors ... during this dark and difficult period . Truly . Mama , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . No . You have nothing to apologize for . Come here , my baby penguin . Come here . Come here . Hey . I know you could have denied it all , like so many others . And you didn 't . And I have never been prouder of you . - Mama ... - Yes , I am your mama . And I always knew this day was coming . - You knew ? - Of course . You were too good a dancer to be a straight boy . Whoo ! I love you , Mama . Why do you like watching this silly movie every year ? I don 't know . I guess I like what it believes in . What does it believe in ? People . Ooh I heard there was a secret chord - Hi , Dads ! - That David played And it pleased the Lord But you don 't really care for music Do ya ? Your faith was strong But you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight Overthrew ya She tied you to her kitchen chair - She broke your throne - I got you a little something . She cut your hair And from your lips She drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah Baby I 've been here before I know this room I 've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew ya I 've seen your flag on the marble arch And love is not a victory march It 's a cold And it 's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah Hello , woman in my head . Hello , man in my head . Maybe there 's a God above And all I ever learned from love Was how to shoot at someone Who outdrew ya It 's not a cry you hear at night It 's not somebody who 's seen the light It 's a cold And it 's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah Merry Christmas , Will . - What ? - No ! No ! - What is it ? Are you okay ? - He 's here . Oh , no . I 'm less interested in where you are , and more interested in where you should be . Shouldn 't you be home ? Shouldn 't you be with your dad ? He 's a good man , your father . He misses you . Okay ... Don 't you miss him ? Dad . So normally these ... these would all be up . Will 'd come over , we 'd do it together . Have eggnog . But Will 's not here . - He ain 't fucking here . - Dad ... Dad . Let me help you . - You 're okay . - No , no , no ... Nah , fuck it , fuck it . Forget it . - Come here . Be careful . Uh-huh . - Thank you . - I probably shouldn 't have come , but ... - It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's just when I heard your son was mixed up in all of this , I couldn 't help but think about that young girl and everything we went though . You 're as sick as your secrets . He doesn 't look well , does he ? My son ... is a good cop . Way better cop than I ever was . I am sure that Will got himself into all this trouble with the best of intentions . Damn right . He got that , um ... terrorist . Malaki . If it was intentional . I was told that , uh ... Will probably was working with Jonas Maliki . Dad , Dad , don 't listen to him . That 's bullshit . Well , he did use unauthorized codes to break into classified files , he was suspended , he did flee the country to Iceland where he terrorized one of our research facilities . It 's all on security footage . - These are just the facts . - They 're lies ! They 're lies ! I don 't know what the fuck is going on . Dad ... Should a man in his condition really be drinking ? I am gonna fucking kill you . I 'll let you in on a little secret . I don 't care what my son did . I just want him to come home . So do I , Mr. Gorski . So do I. Okay ... What happened ? He 's with my dad . Oh , Will . I don 't know , Riley . I don 't know if I can ... keep this up . I don 't know if I can beat him . You don 't have to . We do . And we will . Grace said you were in some kind of trouble . - We 're working it out . - You know you can always come home . The Man won 't find you up with us . Neither will email . You know we love you . Yes , we do , baby ! Thanks , Dads ! - You must stay for New Year 's . - Sorry , Mama . New Year 's , it 's a bit complicated for us . - Why ? - Um ... My parents were killed in a car accident on New Year 's . Oh . How terrible . They were beautiful people . I miss them . On New Year 's , I like to think about ... everything they gave me and how short it all can be . Dani . Hey ... - Are you okay ? - Hey , Dani , what 's wrong ? My family is nothing like any of this . Every day you tip-toe around , hoping you don 't get in a fight . This was probably the best Christmas I have ever had . Is it horrible to think that it 's because it had nothing to do with my own family ? Oh , no . Dani . You have been so kind to my son . You will always be welcome in my home . Thank you . Thank you . Welcome home . What ? What the fuck ? Wolfie , check out the losers down there ! Hey . - Welcome , Wolfie . - Hello , Volker . This place is amazing ! It was built on the site of the very first sector of the wall that was pulled down . The tooth , huh ? All those people down there believed the wall was dividing the world . That East and West were separating people into " us " or " them . " But the real division , the only one that has ever mattered , was never horizontal . It 's vertical . Enjoy yourselves . Okay ... - Careful . Okay . - I 'll do it . These or these ? Dahlias . Mom loved dahlias . - Kala ? - Yeah . Are you all right ? I ... I couldn 't sleep . - It 's New Year 's . - Mmm . Our first as a married couple . It is . That 's a nice thought . Since you were both taken from my life ... I have not felt so loved by another person as I do by this man . You would love him , too . Mmm . Goodness . When I think of my life just a year ago and now ... how different things would be if my father had died or you had said no instead of yes . How fast everything can change . In my fucking house ? ! You 'll start a war ! - Happy New Year ! - Happy New Year ! Whoo ! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ! Please ! Help me ! Wolfgang ! Please ! Help me ! Help ! Help me ! Get off me ! Come on ! Get out of the way ! Move it ! This way ! Okay , you go this way ! - Get the fuck out of here . Go ! - No ! I 'm not leaving you ! Hey ! Take this rocket ! Go on the other side ! Come on , come on , come on . Fuck , fuck , fuck , fuck , fuck . Be calm . Look left ! Happy fucking New Year .

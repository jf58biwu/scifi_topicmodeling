 My name is H.G. Wells . My friend John is Jack the Ripper . He 's escaped from 1893 in my time machine , and I am the only one who can catch him . I know things about you that you don 't even know about yourself . Like the fact that you have a son . In Paris . - Henry Ayers . - Impossible . You asked me if I believe in fate . Oh , I believe very much so that this moment was destined to happen . I understand you went to my childhood home . We did overhear your father talk about his work . Project Utopia ? I don 't know of any Project Utopia . Griffin , your sister 's here . Brooke . What in the hell are you doing here ? John escaped . What happened ? You were supposed to keep him locked up . I know you . Good Lord . What are you looking at ? This is actual footage from World War I. It 's man versus machine . It 's not war . It 's slaughter . Why would John go to such a time ? What was so important in Paris on March 30 , 1918 ? Could you open up that map again ? All we know so far is that he landed at Bois De Boulogne Park . And he could have gone anywhere from there . Be impossible to find . What was happening on that day ? It was toward the end of World War I. The Germans had a new artillery weapon called the Paris Gun . They hid it in the countryside and fired it into the city at random . Despicable . Innocent people struck down at any moment . You said John spent a year in Paris at medical school ? Yes , but that was years earlier , in 1890 . Did he have any friends or family there ? Not that I recall . Except , no , there was a ... there was an English woman who worked at the medical school . Uh ... Oh , what 's her name ? Pauline . Pauline Ayers . He boasted that they were lovers , but then it ended when he went back to London . That 's something . What 's this ? It 's her genealogy . Pauline was only in Paris a few years , moved back to England , worked at a hospital in Stockport , died in 1914 of Spanish Flu . Pauline had a son born in 1891 . Henry Ayers . Mother , Pauline . Father ... John Stevenson . Whoa . Impossible . John never spoke of a son . Maybe he didn 't know . But a-a woman would tell a man such a thing . So she had her reasons . She easily could have kept it from him . So how did he find out ? You can find anything on the Internet today . Henry Ayers . He was a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps , 9th Battalion . He was stationed in Paris , killed in action on ... March 30 , 1918 . That 's it , then . John 's gone back to Paris to save his son 's life . I found some coats for Jane and some currency for you to take . Ah , excellent . Thank you . - You 're welcome . - How 's Griffin ? Oh , John did a number on him , but he 's with the doctor now . He 'll be fine . Do you know where you 're going , exactly ? Uh , Captain Henry Ayers was stationed at the RAC field office in Paris . He was part of the deployment from Paris to Saint Quentin in the north . At 11 : 00 a.m. March 30th , the motorized transport carrying Henry got underway . Shortly after , it was destroyed by German artillery bombardment just outside the city limits . All men were lost . John will try to stop Henry from getting on that transport . That 's what we have to prevent . You 're gonna stop a man from saving his son ? As cruel as it sounds , if his son survives , there 's no foretelling the damage it would cause . H.G. is right . The time ripples it could cause would be devastating . I will find him and bring him back . John must pay for his actions in this world , and I will see to it . Uh , Vanessa , did you discover anything more about Project Utopia ? No , I 've been through my parents ' papers , the corporate archives . There 's no mention of it . But I reached out to a colleague of my father 's . I 'm gonna go see him . He was the head of research in the early years , so he may know something . Do you think I could get away with this in Paris ? Uh , you 're not going . Trust me , you 'll want me there . Je parle Français . I spent a semester there . I know the city inside-out . But 1918 is a time of war . Which is exactly why you need me . No , it 's too dangerous . What kind of man would I be if I put a woman in such peril ? This woman can handle herself . She 's proven it more than once . I 'm well aware , but at the risk of sounding ... Like a sexist pig ? I 've yet to oink , so I fail to understand the " pig " reference , but what I was going to say is that as a man out of his time ... I went to the ' 80s . That wasn 't a problem . I simply must say no . That 's final . Now , Martin , we can 't risk further destabilization of the fourth dimension . You 'll sync the time machine to John 's first jump and send me back in real time ? You got it . John landed in Paris at 6 : 00 a.m. Exactly 2 hours and 17 minutes have passed since then . Therefore , I will arrive at 8 : 17 and have approximately three hours to stop him . Will that be enough time ? Henry 's flat was just down the street from the RAC hospital . My hope is that he didn 't venture too far in the hours before his deployment . Jane . Good luck . I can 't risk her life . She will realize that . Here , I was able to track this down for you . What is this for ? Protection . It 's a 1915 semiautomatic , fully loaded . I am not comfortable taking a gun . Violence is not the option . Well , then , use this to prevent it . Against all better judgment . Wait . When do you want me to send the machine back for you ? 12 : 00 noon . By then , I will have accomplished my mission ... or failed miserably , and all will be lost . _ _ _ _ _ Londoner . Is my accent that dreadful ? I was just down at the Army hospital , and they said this is where many of the doctors come after their shifts . Not for very much longer . The Brits are moving north to fight the Germans at Saint Quentin . You don 't happen to know a doctor by the name of Henry Ayers , do you ? I 'm an old friend . I was hoping to bump into him before he left Paris . Henry Ayers , huh ? You 're friends with that scoundrel ? So I take it he 's a bit sinister , yeah ? Oh , I could tell you some stories . Margot ! Henry , my love ! - How about one last drink for the road ? - Ohh ! Ohh ! Careful , he 'll sucker you into paying for the round . I 'm Margot , by the way . I am this lucky bloke 's fiancée . Henry Ayers . Pleased to meet you . John . Well , don 't be rude . You don 't recognize your friend ? It 's quite all right . I am cursed with a familiar face . And I 'm cursed to never forget them . Are you sure we 've met ? In all truth , no . No , we 've not met . But I 've come to find you because I used to know your mother , Pauline Ayers . I 'll be damned . He actually went to see his son . You knew he 'd go to 1918 Paris ? I knew he had a son in Paris who dies in 1918 . I didn 't think he 'd actually go . Why would John care about having a son ? He 's a psychopathic narcissist . Something was created in his image . - His ego ... - Ow ! - ... must seek it out . - Ow ! That hurts . You should have won the fight . He had a knife . He didn 't play fair . What are you doing ? This treatment is more effective on a fresh wound . What treatment ? Aah , Brooke , come on ! You ... you could have numbed me . I could have . Dermis tissue . Lab-grown from stem cells . What the hell ? This is Dad 's research . A basic version of it , yes . The injection activates the transfer of genetic code from the surrounding skin cells to the undifferentiated tissue . We could have used this in Iraq . Well , pretty soon , every soldier will be carrying it in their pocket . So if that 's the basic version , what else are you doing with Dad 's research ? Well , look at that . Griffin 's interested in something other than himself . No , I 'm serious . What 's going on down here ? Would you like to meet one of my patients ? Nick , this is my brother , Griffin . You don 't mind showing off for him , do you ? Not at all . Does that measure his grip strength ? Yep . Whenever you 're ready . That 's impossible . I 've developed an enhancement drug from his own genetic makeup . That number can 't be right . 900 pounds means he has The strength of six men . And his heart isn 't even up to 150 . - Thank you , Nick . - Anytime , Brooke . I 'll be right back . Is this even legal , what you 're doing ... experimenting on humans ? Clinical trials . Completely legal and contracted . This better be on the up-and-up , not like what Dad did . This could be bad for us . You mean bad for you and your political career ? What 's going on with Project Utopia ? Vanessa 's looking into it . So far , nothing . Make sure it stays that way . Are we doing the right thing here ? There 's still time to stop it all . If Vanessa finds out I 'm involved ... I know you care about Vanessa . You spent all this time getting close to her . It 's only natural . But her family destroyed ours . We lost everything . Don 't forget that . It 's our turn now . My mother moved back to Stockport right before I was born . Did you work with her at the hospital ? I was doing my residency then , and Pauline was kind to me . She spoke so highly of you . I was at the hospital earlier and saw your name on a chart . Thought I 'd look you up . I 'm so sorry to hear of her passing . At least she was spared the sight of this war . She loved Paris . It would have destroyed her to see it this way . Hmm . Yes . And this is where she met your father . She spoke about my father ? A bit , yes . So you know he abandoned her without a second thought . She gave up on Paris so my grandparents could help her raise me . Now here I am , defending it in war . Yes , the number of men killed is ... unfathomable . The past several months have been ... particularly bloody . But still , the mind finds ways through it . It 's a strange thing to take a life , isn 't it ? My calling is to save lives , not take them . Yes , but I imagine the ... lines are often blurred . I can assure you they 're not . Well , it 's impressive to experience darkness and not be consumed by it . Well , we don 't have much choice , do we ? We either reject the darkness or we let it destroy us . Another round ? Please . - Two more , please . - Make it three . What do you say ? I thought you 'd show your face sooner or later . So , Paris at war . Quite a sight , eh ? It 's an inconceivable tragedy . Oh , lighten up . Paris survives . The world marches on . We saw it ourselves . And we saw the scars that were left behind . These conflicts happen again and again . Each time , the killing easier than before . You 're so dramatic . War can never be truly stopped . Once you unleash a beast of this magnitude , there 's no way to call it off . Perhaps one day , we shall annihilate each other . We 'll call it " The War of the Worlds . " I see fatherhood hasn 't granted you a more benevolent view of humanity . Hmm . Yes , Henry . I don 't approve of the name , but a decent lad , nonetheless . Who 'd have thought ? The conclusion is obvious . Leave him alone . Let him stay that way . I 'm doing a heroic thing here . His death is tragic , but the fact remains you can 't change history . Is that a guideline , or will the world fall apart in front of our eyes ? Quite possibly . So I 'm supposed to let my son die ? Is that it ? Unfortunately , yes . Because that is how history records it . Doesn 't the Utopian philosophy require us to use our knowledge to save his life ? It 's not our choice . Saving Henry could cost countless others . Sounds like a grand adventure to me . Is that why you 're doing this ? Thrills ? Do you even care about Henry at all ? Maybe that 's what I 'm trying to discover . You 're a complicated man , John . I 'll grant you that . And I am sorry about your son , but you can 't interfere . Another drink ? - Hey , there . - How are you feeling ? All bandaged up and cleared for combat . Thanks . Have you seen Vanessa ? Uh , she went to go speak with some guy who used to work for her father . About Project Utopia ? She 's on her cell if you need her . No , it-it can wait . What 's all this ? There were photographers and journalists all over Paris during the war , and these are from an archive at the national museum . Wow . Incredible . How do you have access to this stuff ? My job gives me access . What is it you do ? I 'm an assistant curator at the Space Museum , Or I am until I get fired , which could be any day now if I keep calling in sick . Ah . So , um , what are you looking for ? I requested all the images for March 30th thinking maybe I could give us some information that would help us in 1918 , but all that is pointless , given that I 'm here and not in Paris . Yeah . Um , World War I was a dangerous time . I wouldn 't put a woman I cared about in danger like that . Am I the only one here that 's living in the 21st century ? No one wants to put someone they love in danger . I wouldn 't say H.G. loves me . Well , I 've seen you two together . If it 's not love , it 's certainly getting there . Uh , but I do feel for you . Gonna be tough when he finally takes his time machine and heads home . Yeah . I guess it will be . It 's time . I don 't want you to go . I must . But I 'll be back soon . Do you promise ? Yeah , good lad ! You 'll never convince Henry to dessert his comrades . Then I 'll have to use other means to stop him . Sorry to interrupt , gentlemen , but I 'm afraid I must take my leave . When this is all over , I 'll look you up in Stockport . We 'll raise a glass to my mother . I 'd like that very much , Henry . I 'm sorry to see you go . Say a prayer for peace . Peace ... and long life . Well ... always a pleasure , H.G. Stay seated , John . I do believe this moment feels familiar . Albeit reversed . Aren 't you worried people will see ? I will shoot you in the leg and carry you back to the time machine if I have to . You have it all thought out , don 't you ? I can 't let you save your son , John . And you can 't stop me . John ! Not in my café ! He 's a bloody spy . I heard him talking . He said the Germans were up to something ... No , no , you 've got this wrong . I must stop this man . Drop the gun before I kill you . I 'll go get help . _ You have it wrong ! One more word , and you 're dead . - You must listen to me . - You 're not going anywhere . I would explain everything , but Henry 's transport is leaving in moments . What does Henry have to do with this ? John has gone to pull him off the Army transport . - Why ? Is he in danger ? - There 's no time to explain . You have to take my word for it . _ _ Vanessa Anders all grown up . My goodness . I remember when you would come visit your father at the lab . I remember , too . I loved those visits . I think of your father often . Your parents ' death was such a tragedy . So much important work left undone . Well , that work is why I 'm here , Dr. Meyers . I 've recently come across a project my father was working on ... Utopia . Do you remember it ? Oh , Utopia . Um ... no , not sure that rings a bell . It was 1980 . My father had just patented his breakthrough . You were his right-hand man . You knew everything going on in the lab . It was such a long time ago , Vanessa . Sometimes , the past should stay the past . Dr. Meyers , please . This is extremely important . What can you tell me ? I-I just don 't want you to be disappointed in your father , to think less of him . Why would I think less of him ? David was a brilliant scientist , but he was young , impatient . Some of the medications he patented ... they saved the company from financial ruin , but he didn 't do the original research . Did he steal the research ? He never admitted it , but I did suspect . There was no name on the files other than " Utopia . " And after your parents were killed , the original hard copies vanished . Well , there must be something left . I still have everything I brought from ... from the lab when I retired . But such a long time ago , Vanessa . It 's ... it 's unlikely , I 'm afraid , that I have anything that can help you , but , uh , I 'll look . - Thank you . - All right . Excuse me . Excuse me . Henry Ayers ? Henry Ayers . That way ? Thank you . I 'll get right to it . Henry ! Henry . John . You shouldn 't be here . Listen to me . It 's vitally important we speak . - I only need a moment . - Pardon me , sir . I don 't think you understand . I 'm deploying to war . One , sir . I have urgent news from your father . That 's impossible . My father doesn 't even know I was born . I swear on my life he does . He sent me to find you . You worked with my mother . How do you know my father ? Just ... come with me for a moment . - I 'll tell you everything . - Allons-y ! All right , men , let 's move out ! What 's so important my father couldn 't say it to me himself ? Your transport is going to be ambushed . You and your men will be dead before you even make it to the front . You 're mad . Where did you get this information ? I can 't say , but your father sent me here to help you . That is the most unbelievable part of all . My father is a vile prat who only cares for himself . Why would he help me ? Because you 're nothing like him . I should hope not . Hey , you . Busy day ? More like one of those days where nothing is going right . Mm , how can I help ? You could keep doing what you 're doing for a few more seconds . Oh , hold on . Things might be getting a little better . Okay . Dr. Meyers . Vanessa , my late wife always told me I was a hoarder , but sometimes , it does come in handy . You found something . Some old files that I thought had been shredded , but I haven 't had a chance to go through them yet . I 'll be right there . - Who is Dr. Meyers ? - Cedric Meyers , a scientist . I will explain everything when I get back . - All right . - Just keep your fingers crossed . Okay . Hey . Hey , so I have something on Utopia . We need to find Cedric Meyers . Help ! Someone ! It 's too late . They 're all gone . I have to get back to my men . You don 't understand what I mean by " gone . " Why are you doing this ? Clearly not for the gratitude . You have kidnapped me against my will . I saved you ! Your father saved you ! The man you judge , the man the whole world has put on trial in absentia ! The selfish , vile prat . The Ripper ! You know him so well , yet beg to know why . Why ? Why ? ! He 's lived a dark and dishonorable life . He 's done despicable things . But that does not preclude the possibility of good , does it , hmm ? My boy . My boy . Congratulations . You are the proof ... the one good thing he might ever do . The punctuation of a remarkable , misunderstood life . You 're a madman . I do ... I do believe you 're right . Untie me . At once . Are you with the 9th battalion ? There 's been an attack , sir . German artillery hit the convoy on the outskirts of the city . There have been heavy losses . Sir , do you know , was everyone present and accounted for ? Yes . Yes . P-Please , I ... I need a moment . - Let 's go and search the tents . - Yes , sir . You son of a bitch . Most men respond favorably when someone saves their life . I was supposed to be on that truck . How did you know ? Henry , there 's so much I want to tell you . We 'll leave this place , and I 'll explain everything . I promise I will . Take this second chance , and go be with Margot . Stay away from us . Don 't let me see your face again . 1918 . I have to go back now . This is Henry Ayers on the same day he supposedly died when his convoy was attacked outside the city . The records were wrong . He was never on that truck . He died at a café . H.G. ' s looking for him in the wrong place . We should be looking at Café L 'Automne . Here it is . March 30 , 1918 . " An unidentified army medic , " our Henry , " died trying to rescue people " after the café was hit by the Paris Gun . " There 's no address . Poor guy . Avoided the ambush , but ended up dead , anyway . Jane , I-I don 't think you sh ... That photo . That guy in the background ... can you enlarge it ? Those clothes . It 's H.G. Print ... print the article . H.G. wanted you to stay here , stay safe . He doesn 't get to decide what I can and can 't do . - But if you go back ... - Are you gonna send me back , or are you gonna let him die ? Okay . Okay . D-Do you even know where to find Wells ? Um , the truck just left , so I 'll look for him at the deployment yard . What if you don 't find him in time ? We don 't know when that picture was taken . I 'll find him . Vanessa ? I 'm sorry . I thought you were someone else . Ohh . No ! No , please ! No ! No . No , what are you doing ? Dr. Meyers ? It 's Vanessa . Dr. Meyers ? Hello ? Dr. Meyers ? Cedric ? Dr. Meyers . Oh , God . Dr. Meyers . Dr. Meyers . Oh , God . 911 . What is your emergency ? Hello . I 'm at 380 Oak Street . My friend ... I think he had a heart attack . - Stay on the line . - Yes , I 'll stay on the line . Okay , ma 'am , help is on the way . Hello ? Someone there ? Anybody here ? Hello ? _ _ _ Couldn 't resist Paris in spring , either , I see . - Let go of me . - Lost track of H.G. ? Has he not given you the bad news ? What are you talking about ? I won . The transport left without him . I saved Henry 's life . Congratulations . I hope that makes you very happy . What 's this you 're holding ? That has nothing to do with you . What is this ? Leave it alone , John . Please . Henry dies at the café . I didn 't save him after all . Wait . Wait ! There was an attack on our convoy headed to Saint Quentin . What did you know about it ? I-I knew nothing . How could I ? Do you know what the punishment is for treason ? Margot ! Henry . You came back ! John pulled me off the transport . Everyone else is dead . No ! Henry ! Margot . H.G. ! Oh , God . Oh , God , H.G. Please be okay . I tried to stop it . Please . You need a doctor . Jane , what are you doing here ? I 'm getting you to the time machine . - It 's coming soon , okay ? - Okay . Come on . We have to get you out of here . - Henry . - It 's all right . I 'm here . She 's going to be okay . How did you know ? No , Henry , don 't . - There are still people trapped inside . - Henry ! - Henry . - Don 't ! Henry ! - Help ! - Get away from there ! This is how Henry 's supposed to die . - Henry ! - Henry ! Henry ! Henry ! No ! No ! There was nothing you could do . It was his day to die . H.G. ! No ! H.G. , wake up ! Can you help him ? Can you help him ? ! Please . Please . Please . Not a good sign . - Help him . - Why would I ? Because you 're more than a murderer . You 're a doctor . You told me yourself . Now , prove it . Prove it . His eyes are dilated . Could have brain swelling or internal bleeding . He needs a hospital . - Help me get him to the time machine . - I 'm not going back ! Yes . You have to . There 's nothing left for you here . Please . Please . Where 's the time machine ? This way . His blast injury resulted in a mild hematoma , which obstructed blood flow to his heart . He 's on blood thinners and meds for the pain . All he needs to do now is rest . Thank you for getting him home . Vanessa Anders , I assume . We finally meet . - Where are you putting him ? - The basement for now . I saved Wells . Isn 't that worth anything ? Doesn 't erase what you 've done ... or who you are . I suppose not . Well , it was nice to meet you . I do hope to see you again . Jane ? Where are we ? 2017 . We did it . And what of John ? Vanessa has him locked up . And his son , Henry ? He died . John didn 't change anything . He did help bring you back . He 's locked up ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Easy . We had to insert this tube in your arm . Oh , this is a very impressive anesthetic . I feel very lightheaded . Ooh . And good . Jane , I 'm so sorry . - It 's okay . - No , it 's not . I ... I didn 't wish to be an oinking pig . A sexist oinking pig . I 'm sorry if my behavior offends you . No . I 'm sorry for being too pushy . It 's just I 've grown very fond of you , and the idea that you could be hurt is unbearable . That 's exactly why I had to go back . I had to help you . I do believe fate has brought us together . You 're hurt . You need to rest . No , hurt is what I 'll be when I 'm forced to say goodbye to you . You 're not going anywhere right now but to sleep . But one day , I will go home , and I 'll be forced to live a life without you in it . I can 't imagine a day without you in it . Wells is back , and he brought John with him . Vanessa has him locked up tight . Wells , John , and the time machine all in one place . Makes things easier . You killed Cedric Meyers . - He had a heart attack . - Don 't lie to me , Brooke . Not now , not about this . I did what I had to do to keep your girlfriend from finding out what you 're up to . Well , it didn 't work . Vanessa has Meyers ' computer . Then you better hope she doesn 't find anything , or we 're both screwed . _ _ _

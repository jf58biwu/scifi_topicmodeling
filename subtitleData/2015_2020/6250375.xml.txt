 - ( narrator ) : Previously on killjoys . - Our agents are guided by one principle . One code . - The warrant is all . In the name of the r.A.C. , You are locked and served . - Well , damn ! - Double-booking a kill warrant ? Someone must really want This poor bastard dead . - Are you still having the memory issues ? - Then what do you remember ! ? - I killed them ! - My squad ! I can 't remember what i did- - - No , no , that 's not what i mean . I mean , why didn 't you tell me ? - Don 't you even look at him ! - If i have to , i can do so much more than just look . Get your things . - Why are we here ? - Ashyrus tea . A little taste from home . This is the only place i could find it in the quad . - A hint of honey , Just the way you loved it . - When i was twelve . - Well , you 're in a mood . - I will help you one last time , Under these conditions : I won 't kill for you ; you don 't go near my team ; And when we 're done , you will tell me What the hell you 're doing in the quad . - Interesting proposal . First , i 'd need to know You 're still the yala i trained . - Oh , well , bad news , there : Yala died that night , and she 's not coming back , Least of all to you . - If i could let you go that easily , I would . I hope you know that . That pot is full of jeren gas . When the lid comes off , it will kill everyone in here . The gentleman in the corner ? He 's a courier . Find the case he 's smuggling before you succumb . If you move quickly , maybe you can save a few of them . Up to you . - Shit . Poison gas ! Get out ! ( coughing ) ( deep breath ) ( pandemonium ) ( screams and exclamations ) ( panting ) ¶ ¶ ¶ - There you are . Johnny 's been looking for you . - What did i miss ? Guessing your night 's Been as good as mine . - Punching shit relieves stress . - What stress ? - Been working with pawter All day . Trying to work past these stim blockers , Figure out who 's been monkeying with my brain . No luck . - Maybe it 's time For a different doctor . - She has been working me Pretty hard . - So i hear . - So you " hear ? " Something you want to say ? - Nope . You ? - Yeah , actually . I wanna say thank you . - For ? - Saving my ass on that ship . That 's two lives i owe you , now . - I took that jump for all of us . - Fine . Thank you ... For all of us .

Top priority . - Go ahead . - Rac team 25698-a , You are hereby required to report for a black warrant . Information to follow . - Nice ! - Right ? - A what warrant ? - Spider got the call . And the rygar brothers . - Ha , prinde just wrote " you suckers better be there . Owe you for that nut job on leith- - " - Ok , guys . What the hell 's a black warrant ? - Competitive warrants , top killjoys only , best team wins . - In other words , grab your shiniest toys And your biggest balls . You 're about to meet the family . Woo ! - ¶ ¶ come come come uninvited ¶ - ¶ run run run ' til i find ya ¶ ¶ i don 't care which side that you 're fighting ¶ ¶ ¶ gonna get you going ¶ ¶ - Alright , pirates and ruffians ... ( cheering , laughing and whistling ) Let the party begin ! ( more cheering ) - Just so i 'm clear : This is an " invite only " , Secret warrant , being held in a bar ? - The warrant must have local ties . Hello , hometown advantage . - I brought my brother . But be gentle , He is a black warrant virgin . - Alright well , next round 's On the virgin then ! - Who 's the high money on To win ? - Well , if it 's not on me , You 're all definitely high . ( booing , jeering ) You make that sound , and all i hear is love . Last time i saw you was through crosshairs . - Last time i checked , you missed . - Twice . Right ? - Yeah , it ... Was twice , wasn 't it ? That 's just embarrassing . ( laughing and mockery ) - Hey d 'avin . Got a sec ? - I really don 't think you 're supposed to be here right now . - The rack bought out the bar , not my practice . Speaking of : I 've cleared my entire schedule for tonight So we can focus on you . - Yeah , about that ... - Look i know you 're frustrated . I get it . Progress has been Slow , but it 's a process . We just need to spend more time Working it through . - Actually , i think i need to stop treatment for a while . Sorry . - Really . D 'avin jaqobi is running away again . - No . I just think i need to talk to a specialist . You said so yourself , this isn 't normal battle fatigue . - I still wanna help . What about the army doctor You 've been looking for . - Dr. Jaegar , yeah . But johnny tried to track her , the trail dies in madidus city , so- - - Well that 's good . The company 's flagship Research facility is in madidus . If jaegar 's there , i can probably help you find her . - How can you if johnny can 't ? - I 'm a qreshi , remember ? I have company connections in my blood . Just promise if i do this , You give therapy another shot . With me . Deal ? - Deal . - What if there is no warrant ? What if this is a recruitment call , you know ? To level six . ( laughs ) Boom . I just blew your minds . - Whoa , whoa , i thought there were only five killjoy levels ? - There are . Six is an urban legend . Killjoys supposedly snatched up into some special training camp On arkyn . - Telling you , it is a thing . - Arkyn is a dead moon and you ... Are an idiot . - Man , your soul has no poetry . - Killjoys ! As most of you are aware , some particularly ambitious Individual 's been pulling off a string of robberies on high-end Company haulers . Three seconds of video was captured Just before a stolen ship out of old town went completely dark . It 's the best the company 's security can offer But as always , we can do one better than the company 's best . The suspect 's name is joseph siano , 52 years old , a sniper and expert survivalist , But we know him better as " big joe " . Once the youngest killjoy to rank level five , Currently the oldest to still have it . Now the suspect stole something- - some place you 'd rather be , agent ? The almighty dutch is too good for a lowly briefing ? - Just ... Need some air . - This is bullshit ! C 'mon , no way big joe did it . - People ! That kind of thinking is not going to bring joe back . - There . People died so you could have your shiny new case . Happy ? - It 's not the case , It 's what 's inside . Hold still . You gave me your word . Just , give it a moment To calibrate . - Ow . ( panting ) What the hell is that ? ! - A neuro-link . Just a prototype . But if it works , We 'll be able to see and hear each other as if we were In the same room , no matter the distance . - What am i looking at ? - The last coordinates of the stolen ship Your people are searching for . I believe You have a special fondness for the thief . - You know where big joe is ? Is he ok ? How the hell do you know about that missing ship ? - All the company and most of the rack Would kill to know what i know is on that ship . Knowing things is how i keep us safe , yala . - I 've left an unmarked craft for you on dock 9 . Take it to the stolen ship , alone . Find the device and bring it back to me . - You expect me to work against my own team ? Why would i do that ? - I said i 'd stay away from your team if you do as i ask . You 're not breaking our agreement already , are you ? - The company is looking hard for this ship . If they find out the thief 's a killjoy , That 's bad for all of us , especially joe . - We find him first , we find him fast . This is your warrant . - ( all ) : The warrant is all . - Oh , and as a little extra incentive , The killjoy who brings him in gets 10,000 joy . - Just level-sixed you , bitch ! - Once again : That 's totally not a thing ! - Dutch ? - Where the hell would she go ? Should we be worried ? ( incoming message signal ) - Guess not . " start without me " . - Great , now we 're behind Everyone else . Ok , so , you 're the family thief . How do we find a stolen ship ? - Oh , hey , hey ! I " borrowed " a few little ships my youth . I 'm not exactlyxactly A high tech heist expert . Although , i do know one . We 're looking for a company ship that went dark . - It 's gonna take a lot more than cheap wine And questionable cuisine to earn that kind of intel . - We had a deal . - Deals are made to be broken . - So are fingers and necks . - I watched a man get his eyes pulled out through his nose The other day . That 's what they do in here for fun . A trip to the infirmary ? Hm ! That 's a vacation . ( beeping ) - That 's a qresh finance center account under your sister 's name . Now i 'm not sure That i would have laundered my savings that way , but hey ... - You 're a dead man . - No . I 'm a creative negotiator who stuck a re-tread virus In your account 's outflow . See that number there ? The one that keeps dropping ? That 's your nest egg ... Cracking . - When i get out of here- - - you 'll be broke as shit . Unless you tell us how to find that ship . ( birds singing and insects buzzing ) ( electronic sounds ) ( gasping ) - Well that 's just creepy . We 're gonna need to get you a bell . Are you really here ? - Not physically . Our brains are connected by the neuro-link . You 'll get used to it . - I doubt it . - So tell me about this thief . You seem to know him quite well . - Big joe ? He 's not a thief , he 's a killjoy . - He stole something . That makes him a thief . - You kill people . That makes you a murderer . - That 's true . But what does that make you ? - Still working that one out . Yeah , there 's not a killjoy Who doesn 't owe big joe a debt or a drink . He 's not just a friend , he 's a mentor . - A mentor ? Hm . Am i meant to be jealous about that ? - Of course not , that 'd require you to have feelings . - I 've missed this camaraderie . In the last twelve hours There have been more encrypted messages coming out Of company security than in the last year . What 's on that ship Is very valuable to them . Which makes it valuable to us . - Ideas what it could be ? - Use your differential analysis . Walk me through the options . Like old times . - Nice try . Don 't care . One last job and then we 're through . Whatever 's on that ship has nothing to do with me . Hello , gorgeous ! - Dutch , this is d 'avin , we 're ready to go , respond . - Lucy , check her com . - Coms have been disengaged . - On purpose ? Why would she do that ? - Ok , now we worry . - Ramp engaging . - You doing that ? - No . - I thought this thing had locks . - Trace powder , Custom blend , works on every keypad . No matter how much you clean up after yourself , i know Where your fingers have been . - Now i just feel dirty . - Did coren tell you how to find big joe ? - No idea what you 're saying . - I know you were there . I know what coren does And i know you left smiling . I may be pretty , but i can do math . - Get off my ship , fancy . You 're filling it with douchebag . - Oh , so you don 't wanna know where dutch is ? Fine with me . - Johnny ... - Wait . What do you know ? - She flew out of dock 9 In an unmarked cruiser two hours ago . Alone . My guess ? She 's off to get joe herself . Personal history and all . I can respect that . - You 're an asshole , fancy . You don 't have respect for anything . What do you want ? - To win . You know where joe 's ship is , but he 'll be long gone By the time we 're there . Take me to the site And i 'll use the bloodhound to do the rest . We split the warrant . - No . - We 'll do it . - What ? Why ? - Because he 's right . Dutch and joe go way back . She 's probably Trying to help him without getting us involved . Which means she 's about to get herself in shit If we don 't stop her . - We 've got ourselves a road trip , huh boys ? I call shotgun . - Remember : It 's impolite to shoot a guest . - This case was the only thing left on the ship . Whatever 's inside , looks like big joe took with him . - What 's wrong ? What was in here ? - Something the company would never let you or your " joe " Walk away with . Find it and bring it to me , now . - What the hell are you getting me caught up in , In this little " reunion tour " of yours ? Start talking or i start walking- - Fine . ( gunshot ) ah ! - Yala ! - What 's our status , loose ? - Five minutes until landing . Docking completed . - We got you here , you get us to dutch . - I spent the last two hours not punching him Oui should 've been punching him . - I 'm just messin ' with you , Man . This is the bloodhound . - How 's it work ? - Automated chemoreceptor . Built it myself . Just need something dutch touched . Underwear , bra ... - Pervert . - I suppose that 'll do . ( gasping for air ) - Slowly ... Slowly . Your friends always shoot at you ? If he had better aim , You 'd be dead . ( moan ) - If he wanted me dead ... ( electronic sound ) ( groaning ) : ... I would be . This was just to slow me down . ( searing ) - He 's going to escape . - No . But he 's gonna try . ¶ ¶ ¶ - Heard you killjoys had some big meeting here today . Anything the company should know about ? - Still drink that burner fuel ? - What 's hills drinking ? - No . Whatever you 're about to pull , if it 's for d 'avin , There are other ways to scratch that itch . What 's wrong with my sexers ? - I treat them all . Conflict of duty . - You treat d 'avin too . What do you call that ? - Occupational hazard ? And really good sex . I have a soft spot for broken boys . - Because if you fix them , they need you , and if they need you , They 'll stay . Hmm ? - Did you just " shrink " me ? - Occupational hazard . - I forgot that everything on westerley Has an ugly aftertaste . - You know what i remember ? When the rack was just happy being our errand boys . - Yeah , well ... Times change , hills , Whether we like it or not . - Friendly warning , for old times ' sake . Whatever you 're up to here , keep it quiet . Only so much i can look away from Before i 've gotta kick it upstairs . - Mm-hm . - That for me ? - Doctor 's orders . - Why are we stopping ? Did you find something . - Blood . It 's from dutch . - Blood , fibers and powder . She 's been shot . - Track faster . - Hope you 're hungry . I made your favorite . - Giving up , old man ? - I knew i couldn 't slow you down for long . Sorry about the shoulder . But you 're welcome for me missing the artery . - You always could thread the needle . There 's a black warrant on you , joe . - You come to lay hands on me , dutchie ? ( chuckling ) I missed you kiddo . - A dozen killjoys are heading here . I 'm just here for what you stole . But , i know if i try to get it , You 'll probably- - - yup . And then you 'll - - ( hit and laugh ) - Uh-huh ! - You 're still a little bit loose on the right side . - And you 're still predictable . ( laughing and groaning ) - Old dog , old tricks . - I 'm tired of old dogs disappointing me today . Just be one of the good ones , please ! - I 'm trying to be , now listen to me . For your own good , get outta here . ( panting ) I don 't want you caught up in this . - In what ? This can 't be how you end your career . Legendary killjoy caught and caged Like some kind of animal ? - How do you think it ends , dutch ? You think they throw us a parade when they take back our badges ? They don 't . The rack uses us up and then they toss us aside When they 're done with us . The only reason our beloved " brotherhood " is interested In my ancient ass at all , is because my name 's on a warrant . 'cause of this- - - I 'm not working the warrant , joe . You can leave . I just need this . - Well , now , that 's gonna be a problem . Because so do i . - We said come alone ! - The hell is this ? Who 's she ? - I got no idea , innis . Never seen her before in my life . - Well if you two don 't know each other , then She won 't care if i blow off your head . Three , Two ... - Captured . No doubt because of him . I told you . Friendship makes you weak . Do you believe me , now ? - Shut up . - I didn 't say anything . And i told you to run . - And i told you , i need what you stole . ( sighing ) : Wish i knew what the hell it was . Was . - ( laughing ) : Yeah , me too . - What ? You don 't know what it is ? Why did you steal it , you idiot ? - I get my kicks targeting ships with the most security , Thumbing my nose at the company . Most of the time they come with pretty good cargo , But this time ... Just that one tiny ass little box . If the company wants it , it 's got value . - What happened to you , joe ? - Life . The kotlers here are political radicals . True leithians . I was serving a warrant to one of their sons And they paid me to look the other way . Pretty soon they just started paying me to steal them things . Guns , mostly . Lots of guns . Look , I 'm sorry i dragged you into this , dutch . I was a much better man when you knew me . - You 're still a better man than some . - Lucas , listen , brother , you 've gotta let her go . You 've got to let her go . This is a misunderstanding . - If he hurts you , i will take his hands . - I apologize , miss . Sometimes my son has more passion than sense . - She 's a lying dirty westerlyn . Let 's just string her up , her and her pig friend . - Your family 's a wee bit racist . - My son is a patriot . We believe in a pure leith . We had an arrangement with joe . Only when we come to collect , he 's with another rack agent And some device nobody seems to be able to identify . So tell me , what are your people planning ? Is this reconnaissance for a raid ? - No , i already told you . - What 's this on your neck ? - Don 't ! ( moist removal , coughing ) - It 's probably recording us . They 're spies . - Take joe . Find out what the hells is going on . - No ! Wait , let 's talk ! - Trust me , you will talk . You 'll both talk . - ( laughing ) : Damn ! You can hold your hokk for a qreshi ! No offense . - None taken . Are you a born westie ? - Fifth generation . - Wow , so your grandkids are seventh gen ? Good for you ! - Damn right . They 'll be making The jump to leith when they open the gates . Got a nice little plot picked out for them there already . Company 's been good to me in that way . - They should be . Can 't be easy for you , Putting on that uniform , Policing your own people for them every day . - Yeah . But you do what you 've gotta do , to take care of your own . The other days , You drink . ( chuckles ) - What are we dealing with ? - Got movement on the perimeter . - And inside ? - Two rooms . Your girl 's in the big one . Just her and one other guy . - We 're going in and dutch is coming out . Let 's go . - Going in with what , your winning smile ? Look at the flag . True leithians . - So ? - Extreme nationalists , hate outsiders . Probably have an arsenal in there . We need an actual plan . - You two hang back , take care of the guards , I 'll take the door and grab dutch . That 's the actual plan . - He gets growly , doesn 't he ? - Little bit . ( chuckles ) - Access company database . - Access restricted . Biometric signature required . - Oh , come on ! ( grunt and yelp ) Think , simms , think . Time for your physical , soldier . Say ahh . - Ahh ... - Halimetric sample verified . Access granted . - Yes ! Ha ! In your face , technology . Company database . Cross - reference physicians . Keyword : Jaegar . - Searching . - Yeah , i wouldn 't bother trying to break free of those . It 's a special fiber . The more you struggle ... Tighter it gets . - That 's a fun trick . Now can we get on with the torture ? I 'm not much for small talk . - Tell me what you know About the seventh generation accord ? ( screaming and finger snapping ) Just tell me . - I 'm not a local girl . Sorry . - Years ago , After enough westerlyns bitched and mewled about it , The nine families of qresh made them a deal . If you work on westerley for seven generations , Stay outta trouble , your descendants can claim land On leith . Only nobody asked us . - I 'm not interested in race politics . - This isn 't about race . - Racists usually say that . - This is about a farm . This farm has been in my family for ten generations . ( more screaming ) and after a couple of bad crops , The farm bureau have decided to come in and steal it From under from us and give it To the first seventh-geners who show up with their hands out . Now there 's a rack agent here on surveillance . How many more of you are coming ? - The rack doesn 't work like that . We don 't take sides . - You don 't know very much about your people , do you ? When war comes to the quad , Who do you think stands to profit most ? - So , your brother . He got a thing going with dutch yet ? - That 's none of my business . - It will be . Less than five percent of killjoy teams are trios . Eighty percent of those trios fail , Because somebody 's screwing somebody else . - Has it ever occurred to you that if you were even Slightly less of a dick people might actually want to work with you ? - Can 't do that . - Because ... ? - Every organization needs a designated asshole . That is my gift to the killjoy collective . The asshole may not be liked , but he will always Be necessary . Because he does what 's needed . You first . - Alright . Going non-lethal . - Ah ! - What the hell are you doing ? - Directional dart . My own design . - You really are " fancy " . - Innis , bring joe in here and increase security outside . - Leave him ! He doesn 't know anything ! - He 's not talking , but kristana 's been picking up some chatter . A lot of buzz about stolen company tech . They 're calling it a weapon . - What the hell are you two Planning to do ? - Don 't be an idiot . Kill a rack agent and they 'll come for all of you . - Well , we 'll find out . Use it on joe . - Ah ! Cut my damn hand on it . I 'm bleeding . - Just do it ! - No , no , no , no ... Damn it ! - So much for stealth . Switching to lethal . - ( dutch ) : Wait ! ( sounds of shooting outside ) - This is it , they 're coming ! - Everybody take positions , now ! - Get a blade , you have to cut them . - Hey ! Hey ! - Reclamation agent ! Drop it ! - Weapons down ! - Knew more of you were coming . - And we 're leaving , Just give me the device . - Come and take it . - Stop . We don 't even know what it does ! ( loud loading-like sound ) - D 'avin , move ! - What the hell has happened ? - Innis ? Kristana ? ( lets out air . ) - Dutch . Let 's move and get this to johnny . - Be right there . ( shrill electronic sound ) - Let 's make sure that 's not Set for round two . - What the hell happened ? Ened ? Why did it skip us ? - I think it 's some kind of genetic bomb . Looks like one of them got blood on it . It must have read their dna And took out the whole family . You could wipe out An entire bloodline with this thing Or target just one person in a crowd . - Looks like it missed one . - ( dutch ) : Why not you , lucas ? - I married into the family . The children were my late wife 's . But in my heart i loved each and every one of them Like they were my own . This land was for them . - What the hell do we do with this thing , dutch ? - Any chance i can still take that " go on , Get outta here " option ? - The warrant still stands , Joe , they 'll find you . Call ahead to turin , Tell him we 're coming in hot . All of us . Maybe we can trade the bomb For mercy . ( shouts and whistles ) - Shut it ! Agent siano . Lucky the rack found you before the company did . And you , Don 't expect applause for doing your damn job . - Listen , right now we 've got bigger problems . - The only problem i see , is you 're a pain in my ass . - Funny . I was just about to say the very same thing . I 've got a bitch of a headache , and the company 's Kicked into crisis mode , and " killjoys " is the watch-word . Now somebody better tell me what 's going on here . - It 's about this . I took it from a company 's ship . - And this is what it does . What the hell 's the company up to , hills ? Why do they need a weapon like this ? - With me . ( blows air . ) - Still got your brand , big j . Anything you want Is on the house . - Ahh ... ( snif ! ) Killjoys , company guards ... I count maybe fifteen . Shitty odds . - We 've gotten out of worse . - What do you say ? One more time , you and me ? - I can 't just turn him over to you . - Turin , we got him dead to rights- - - We both know what happens to killjoys in a company jail . My people will not sign off on that . - And when my people hear a rack agent robbed our ships , And exposed a blacklist weapon , They won 't sign off on anything less . Things are already tense between our two sides . Let 's not light that match tonight . Something 's gotta give . - I did what i could joe . - The warrant has been upgraded . ( beeping all around ) - ( sighing ) : Level five warrant ? Joe ! - Just do it fast . - No . - C 'mon , I don 't want to spend my last days as a target . Please . - No . - Do it dutch . - Do it ! - No ! ( shot ) - The warrant is all . Joe would 've wanted it that way . - Where 's the device ? - I don 't know . Go find it yourself . I 'm done with you . - Enough ! You are not the only one with orders , yala . When you disobey mine , you put both of us at risk . ( groaning and slicing ) ( grunting ) - I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have put hands on you . I am not A monster , yala . Everything i do serves a purpose . You asked me why i came to the quad ? I came for you . And i am not leaving without you . - Well hello there , hillary . - If you 're going to dose me and steal my clearance , Do a better job of clearing your tracks . - What ? - Illenore pawter simms , You 're under arrest for information theft And drugging a company official . Alright ! Right ! - You 're not serious . - Ok , let 's not add to the charges . - Call off your goons or my family will have your job . - Ooh ... Yeah ... I have a few " highborn " qreshi connections myself . I asked about you . I think you have a little problem . - No one back on qresh gives a shit What happens to you here , So i 'm gonna give you one last chance To help yourself . Who is dr . Jaeger ? - Alright . The hard way it is then . Take her to westhole . - I just think we need to give her some time . - And i think it 's time i be the designated asshole . We had a deal , dutch . No more secrets , No more disappearing acts and you 've ... - Khlyen found me . - Uh , we can leave . We can , uh ... We can go off the grid , anywhere you want . - Who 's khlyen ? - He was my tutor At the harem i grew up in . Not entirely sure , now , What he was even training me for . - What do you need ? - I need this to stop . Which means ... I need your help . But that will make you both Even bigger targets than you already are right now . - I still owe you two lives , remember ? - Whatever you 're in , we 're in . - He 's never hurt me ... Not ... In anger , Not until tonight . Something 's wrong . Something about that bomb scares him . Johnny , i need you to figure out a way To track him down with this . I 'm tired ... Of playing defense . We 've belled the beast and now , we 're going after him . - And what do we do when we find him ? - I 'm gonna kill him ... Somehow . Closed captioning by sette inc . Somehow .

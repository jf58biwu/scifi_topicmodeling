 Binoculars . Go down . Go down now . Go down . Get to shelter . Get to the boat , get to the boat ! Salvation , come in . I 'm spotting a flare from Junk City . - Sending up flares . - Flares ? How many ? - Just one . - Okay , thank you . This is Salvation to Junk City . Come in . Salvation to Junk City . Do you read ? It 's gone . I don 't see Junk City at all . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Say again . What you see ? Nothing . Nothing ? What you mean , you see nothing ? - I can 't see the city . - Wait . - You can 't see the city ? - That 's what I said , I can 't see it . - Well , where are you looking ? - I 'm looking east . - Look west . - I looked west , there 's nothing there . Well , if you don 't see anythi ... Do you see part of the city or all of the city ? I don 't see the city at all . He 's drunk . Could somebody get up there ? He 's had too much of the home brew . This is the Osprey . I am heading for Junk City . Uh , this is Salvation to Barrick . Come in . - Yeah , go for Barrick . - We need some eyes on Junk City . I can do that . I 'm heading right by there . Let me know what you see . Barrick , out . Vestron Research Station calling for the Osprey . - Yeah . Go for Barrick . - Barrick , what 's your 20 ? Uh , I 'm about 20 nautical miles out . I 've got your rebar , and I got some mint copper for you . Outstanding . What 's your E.T.A. ? The boys are itching to hitch that scrubber to the rocket . Yeah , I 'll get there when I can . We 'll have some home brew waiting for you when you get here . - Did you make it ? - Not this time . - In that case , I will take some . - Over and out . What 's our status , Nichols ? You want the good or the bad ? - Surprise me . - Okay . The rocket 's nearly ready . Atmospheric conditions are lining up quite nicely for launch . Starting this week , optimal conditions for the CO2 scrubbers will dominate this region for a 62-hour window . And the bad news ? Even if the parts Barrick bring work , we still need more chassis components to weld the scrubber unit to the craft properly . We can get those from Salvation . Even so , we won 't be able to test the scrubbers before launch . - You mean a dry run ? - Exactly . The scrubbers rocked the simulations . We were able to get CO2 levels down to pre-flood levels and then some , but as you know , there 's no substitute for actual testing . Why can 't we test it ? We only have enough materials to run the scrubbers once . I thought we were making two sets of scrubbers . Once we got into it , we realized we only had enough material to make one . Okay , so we 've only got one shot at this . Better make it perfect . And we 'll do our best to make that happen , but that takes time , and I 'm afraid if we wait too long , we lose our launch window . Temperatures are increasing . We 're getting close to the point where the device may not have an impact , no matter how powerful it is . The sooner that we can get the scrubbers into the atmosphere , the better chance we have of reversing the warming trend . We didn 't come this far to fail , Dr. Nichols . I understand that , but we have to consider the possibility of error caused by working too quickly . My team is worn out . You push them too much , and an error could be catastrophic . What do you need ? I 'd ask for a miracle , but I will settle for more time for Munro and Ishi to check and double-check the launch parameters . - You 've got 48 hours . - Thank you . Micro-light 's juiced up . I can be there in 20 . Can you transmit video back from that range ? No . I clock out at a mile . I 've gotta get the video booster from Vestron . Okay , then you radio back when you got a visual then , yeah ? Yeah . Got it . Salvation to Junk City . Salvation to Junk City ! Come in ! We can put extra men on the wall , but I need to know what we 're dealing with . Well , Nathan 's on it . We should know something within the hour . Yields from the greenhouse are low . It 's been too hot , and it 's gonna keep getting hotter . The solar stills ain 't making enough fresh water to keep us on survival rations . My guys on edge ... from the linesmen all the way down to the fish crew . Everyone 's itching for a fight . Report to me when you got news from Junk City , hmm ? I find out they wasted a flare , I 'll personally go down there ... I don 't think they would do that . I really don 't ... Uh , on another note , I got another request from Oceanic , yeah . They want more bits for their rocket . - Can we spare ' em ? - Yeah . Then let 's see what they 're willing to barter . - We got a survivor , rainwater docks . - Copy that . I am on it . Get in the boat ! Hold on to something ! Come on ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Barrick , Barrick , you need to get the hell out of there . Come on . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . I 've never seen anything like it . You okay ? Come on . Barrick . You 're in the clear . I 'm gonna go to Salvation and tell them what happened . Yeah , I 'll do the same when I get to Vestron . Okay . Radio me if you need anything . Yeah , copy that . You do the same . Over . Are you thirsty ? It 's rainwater from the monsoon 18 clicks away from here . Try it . Try it . All right , easy , easy , easy , easy . Hey , come have a look over here . I want to show you something . Come here . Come over here . It 's okay . That 's where we 're going , right ? Focus on where we 're going . Look at me . Okay ? Man , there were thousands . Now we 've all seen superpods of dolphins . This was like that , except they were sharks , a magnitude larger than anything I 've ever seen . And in the middle , there was one . Man , it was massive . You 're asking me to believe in something we ain 't never seen in our years on the ocean ? Well , the ocean is adapting . Okay , okay , but isn 't it more realistic to say that the sharks were attracted to the destruction of the city , rather than being the cause of it ? We 've seen disasters before where they 've shown up , like capsizing at Sharna , right ? Man , you want to know what happened , you gotta speak to Barrick . He pulled a survivor . - Come on , kid . - No . Do you know what this place is , kid ? It 's Vestron Station . This is where they survived the great flood . It 's the safest place in the entire world . They got rockets here . - Right , Doc ? Rockets ? - We do , actually . Just one . It won 't help . What ? Rockets won 't stop them when they come . When who comes ? Sharks . - Listen . Um ... - Bea . Bea . Hi . I 'm Dr. Nichols . If you don 't want to get off this boat , you don 't have to . - You can stay right here . - Uh , no . What do you mean she can stay here ? No , she can 't stay here . It 's all the same . As soon as you unload your cargo , you 're taking her to Salvation . - I got another run to do . - You do , and it 's to Salvation . We 're all going there . Last I checked , you 're on a contract with Oceanic . We give you fuel and supplies for your services . Yeah , but it 's limited to deep-sea recovery and salvage . Well , it would be a salvage of sorts . Salvation has agreed to supply us with some iridium casings for our electrical contacts , so I need to check the stability of the iridium . So we all gotta go ? Yes . We need to powwow with D 'Amato . They want to talk to you and your passenger . So whatever new trouble this is , we need to sort it out quickly . We 're running out of time for the launch . Hi . I 'm Dr. Shaw . - Bea . - Nice to meet you , Bea . I want to show you something . Can you come here ? Come on . - See that rocket right there ? - Uh-huh . We 're going to attach a device to that rocket called the CO2 scrubber . CO2 is what caused the poles to melt and the entire planet to be covered with water . So our team , which is headed up by Dr. Nichols , has created this device . They 're gonna put this device on the rocket and fire it up high into the atmosphere , hoping with the right conditions that this will actually reverse the effect . - Do you know what means ? - No more water ? Yeah . Dry land . - Sounds crazy , doesn 't it ? - Very . I know , but we have some of the best minds on the planet working on it . So ... we need everybody 's help , including yours . Will you help us ? - Yeah . - Okay . Now , if we could just get this thing unloaded , we could leave . Barrick ... this should help you grow some . What 's that for ? It 's for radio tagging the sharks . You want to tag sharks , do it on your own time . I don 't know what your problem is with me , but I suggest you deep-six it . I don 't have a problem with you , Doc . I think you have a ... a great personality . But after what I saw at Junk City , I see a shark , I 'm out of there . So what 's your take on this ? When the poles melted , we saw the fish population explode . More nutrients in the water meant more fish , and it grew exponentially . But what we 're seeing now is a population collapse due to the excessive temperatures . Now , plankton are the base of the food chain . The smaller fish eat the plankton , which in turn feed the larger fish and all the way on up to the top with sharks . But now with the excessive heat , the ocean is too warm for the plankton to survive . This in turn causes the fish population to crash on down the line , and what you 're left with is a bunch of top predators with nothing to eat underwater . So what do they do ? They look for food on top of the water , and that 's us . The ocean is dying ... and it 's gonna try to take us with it . I saved some images on the sonar from Junk City . Come and have a look . Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? A bunch of different shark species schooled together ? - I 've never seen that before . - Yeah . What 's that huge thing in the middle ? That 's the mother of all sharks . How many people are living at Salvation ? Over 400 . That 's a big meal . That 's exactly the kind of thing that 's gonna draw them here . They 've got shark nets around this place . If it 's sharks , my guys can handle that . Bring it on . We haul dozens of ' em out of the sea every day . Where do you think we get the oil for our lamps ? Yeah , but these sharks ... these sharks are not normal sharks . I find it hard to believe an entire flotilla could be taken down by sharks . You better believe it . Okay . Let 's say I do . What are our options , hmm ? We got over 400 people here . Can we take ' em to your station at Vestron ? We 're not set up for that . Then why 'd you come here , hmm ? You want something from us , but you not willing to help ? Look , we 're a science station . We 're set up for 40 or 50 people max . It would take weeks to upgrade . Well , then I guess you people are gonna be working double-time . We could take some people to the HAARP substation . It 's been mothballed for over a year . How many people can you put over there ? Maybe 200 . - What about the rest ? - Look , I would vote for that , but , uh ... you know , as long as you didn 't care about your machinery and all . I know these folks . They 're gonna strip it down for usable parts . Whose side you on ? Everyone 's . I just take into account the nature of our rough-and-ready-type folks here , you know ... myself included . Look , we 'll take people over there if we need to , but prepping the station takes time . We need to do something now . You have the shark nets . I would suggest beefing them up . - Yeah , we don 't have the nets . - What ? We had to cannibalize them to build the expansion wing , okay ? The kind of fishing we do round here ... nets just get in the way . So what defenses do you have ? We do what we do best . Moffat ... relay it down the line . Get every able-bodied man down here now . - Maybe we could just ... - Now ! Will do . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . We got some sharks to kill . Fishing is a full-contact sport around here . With all due respect , D 'Amato , do you really think this is the best idea ? I don 't tell you how to run your show . Don 't tell me how to run mine . - But if what they say is correct , then ... - I 'm sorry . Junk City ... was a collection of scavengers scraping a living off the surface . Heavy wind could have just blown them over . We , on the other hand , have been here from the start . The sea took the land from us , and now we take what we want from the sea . It 's gonna take a whole lot more than a few sharks to take us out . Yeah , I 'm going back to the Osprey . You 're coming with me . Nathan , we need some eyes in the sky . I want to find out where those sharks are headed . - I can do that . - Okay . Get ready ! We done hit the jackpot ! Come on ! You come get it ! Come on ! Dr. Shaw ! This ain 't nothing but another day for my people ! Get on outta here . Go ! Go back out ! Stay here . Hang on . Wait for her . Go . Take her there . Get her . Let 's go . Come on ! Hurry up ! Get back ! Get back ! Up you get . Come on . Come on ! - That 's my boat ! - Go this way ! Go ! Go ! Grab my hand ! - Keep this for me ! - Quickly ! Go that way ! Go ! Hurry up . Hey ! Hey ! Over here ! Come to mama ! Hey ! Over here ! Hey ! Come to mama ! Come on , you ! Yeah . Come on ! Quickly ! We gotta get off this thing ! Hurry up ! Go this way ! Go ! Go ! Here ! Here , here ! You came here for this , right ? For your project ? Thanks . We gotta get these people off the flotilla ! - Follow me ! - Go , quickly ! Hurry ! Where 's the ... where 's the boat ? Come on ! All right , go on ! You gotta jump ! - No , no , no ! - Jump ! Quickly , Jump ! We don 't have a chance . Moffat , go ! Come on ! Barrick , get the girl ! Come on ! You can do it ! - Swim ! - Come on . Moffat , listen to me . There ! - Barrick , get this . - I got it . I got it . What the hell is that ? Get in the boat ! Get in the boat ! Get in the boat ! - Wait ! Is this as fast as you can go ? - Yeah . Why don 't I just get out and push , shall I ? - Hey , why don 't you do it ? - Yeah , I just might ! - Nichols , did you see what those sharks did ? - I saw what it looked like . I 've seen it before , the smaller sharks defending the bigger one . Sharks aren 't altruistic . The young cannibalize each other in the womb . - Something else is going on . - Go on . Sharks have heightened senses . 2 / 3 of their brain are dedicated towards smell . They can sense electromagnetic fields , and my guess is they 're using the electromagnetic fields to communicate , and she 's controlling them somehow . So you 're talking electrocommunication ? Sharks are tuned to read bioelectrics . It 's not a huge leap to believe that if a shark can track its prey using the electromagnetic fields , it can also broadcast electromagnetic pulses to communicate . They 're built to receive these signals . The same ampullae de Lorenzini they use to track their prey can be used to receive these signals via electrocommunication . Maybe we can use that against them . Hey , guys , we got bigger problems . There are so many . Hundreds of them following her . She 's ... she 's controlling them . Come on , girl . This alpha female is controlling an army of sharks . Doc , can you do me a favor ? Go upstairs , and keep the boat straight , okay ? - What 's the speed looking like ? - We got 15 knots ! Hey , Doc , is it increasing ? - 17 knots ! - Yeah , that should do it . You okay ? Vestron Station , come in . This is Shaw . Osprey calling for Vestron . Come in . We read you . So you think you can get the HAARP transmitter juiced up for one more run ? Last time we ran that thing , it zapped the power grid to the station for two weeks . We had to replace the transformers and rewire the entire station . Are you sure we can take that kind of risk ? That would set the whole program back . I don 't think we have a choice . Take Project XIII off the grid . Get your team over there . I need that transmitter working . I can 't guarantee we can even get it running . No one works over there anymore . Nichols and you are better than anyone . Nichols is here if you need input . Get it online , and get back to me . I 'll give you the target . So you do know of the collateral damage that may occur ? Bouncing electromagnetic beams off the ionosphere , it could result in earthquakes , tsunamis , a whole wealth of natural disasters that we 're not equipped with deal with . Not to mention if anyone 's in the path of the directed beam , could result in irreversible damage . Thank you , Dr. Munro . I 'm well aware of the risks . We will be clear of the target zone before I reactivate the beam . Ishi , what 's the status on the rocket ? We are working to attach the scrubbers , but because of the conditions they would be subjected to in the upper atmospheres , I 'm suspending final attachment until you return with the iridium casings . We need to create a harness that can withstand the heat . Negative , Ishi . Continue your work . Without the addition of platinum iridium , I cannot guarantee the structural integrity will be maintained until deployment . It could rupture on launch . Casings are on their way . Continue your work . We don 't have much time . Sir ... Find a way to make it work . Double-weld the seams , and heat-treat them . The iridium can go on at a later stage . We need to do this now . We have no alternative . This launch window may be our only chance to utilize the scrubber . Dr. Munro , get that transmitter working . Get back to me . You heard her , then . No time to waste . Well , in theory , we should be able to create a device that mimics the effects of a capsizing boat and the hundreds of people in the water . If we place the device in the right place , then the sharks will come . Where are you thinking of dropping it ? Dwilson Ridge . Volcano ? It 's an underwater caldera . There are a few smokers , but it 's mainly dormant , so it 's asleep , but not dead . So when it erupts , then several megatons of energy will be released . What do you mean , " when it erupts " ? We 're going to use the HAARP transmitter . Okay , so turn the beam to the right frequency , and it excites the magma . Then the frequency of the focused beam forces the atoms into a plasma state , which then in turn causes a volcanic eruption . English ? - Do you remember Project Provenance ? - Yeah . When we attempted to recreate land mass . So it was our intent to reboot civilization on manmade islands . The goal was to utilize cooled magma rock and turn it into inhabitable land formations . So ... using the HAARP to trigger submarine volcanoes by zapping the upper atmosphere with focused electromagnetic radio waves . Yeah , I remember how that turned out . We were in tsunami watch for a week . So why do you think it 'd be any different now ? We 're not trying to recreate a continent . We just need to force an eruption , and that 's what the HAARP transmitter does . And how do we know that the sharks will be over the volcano at that time ? - Leave it to me . - Barrick , you hearing this ? No , no , no , no , no . You 're mad ! - No , there has to be another way . - I 'm open to ideas . Well , Barrick has weapons onboard . We can make bang-sticks . Well , okay , how about electroshock , okay ? We stun the sharks with electricity , and then , bang ! When they float to the surface , we take ' em out with the bang-sticks . There are far too many sharks involved in the attacks . - We need to neutralize them all . - Okay , your device , we have to take it to the volcano and drop it off and then get out of there before it blows , right ? Correct . Yeah , well , I 'm sorry to be the brains of the operation here , but this boat is slower than my metabolism . - How do you suggest we do that ? - We don 't have to . Now , I got the signal booster from your people in Vestron , so you should have eyes all the way ... to the volcano . Excellent . There are two settings , one to initially attract the sharks and the other to draw them in . This is your primary switch . Hit this when you 've made contact with the school . When you 're in position , trigger it here . Drop it , and get out of there . This will send out a transmitter that will descend to the volcano . Once it 's been deployed and you 're clear , I 'll send word to Vestron . They 'll fire the HAARP transmitter . - Got it ? - Got it . - Good luck . - All right . - Hey , stay safe , Nate ! - You too , man . Nathan , when you make contact with the sharks , turn on the first setting of the device . This should draw them in . I got a visual on the school . I 'm going in a little closer . They 're heading southeast . You need to get them to head northwest . I 'm going in . Oh , no . The device is still transmitting . We can be there in 10 minutes . Yeah , well , what do we do ? We could go get it , um ... but if we deploy it at Dwilson Ridge , then the blast radius will be over three miles . Even if we get out of there in time ... the resulting wave will overwhelm us . Well , this is great ! This is fantastic ! Sharks , volcano , wave ! I got two sips left ! There 's another way . Go ahead , Doc . You pilot the boat back . I 'll drop off the device . She tops out at 30 knots , should be fast enough to get you away from the blast zone . I 'll go . - No . It 's not open for discussion . - No , it isn 't . This is your boat . You 're the best person to pilot it , not me . I appreciate the vote of confidence , but there 's a lot of people relying on you . You know how to fly this thing ? I spent two months surveying the western hemisphere for atolls . Yes , I know how to fly this thing . Okay , Nichols is right . We need you here , Barrick . Last time I checked , I was still the captain of this boat . I 'll be fine . All right . Doc , I traded a lot of personal things for this board . I want it back . Or what ? Or you owe me a new rig . Deal . Listen , we 'll meet you in the safe zone , but if something doesn 't feel right , just abort , okay ? There is a transmitter on the device , but we will not have two-way communication , so I 'll leave it up to your discretion . She 's found the school , and she 's drawing them in . Here we go . This could work . - Vestron Station , come in . This is Shaw . - We read you . I need an update on the HAARP . What 's your status ? We were over at the facility . Some of the controls seem to have been stripped to use on the rocket . We 're going to have to jumpstart this thing manually . I got Nichols out there risking it all to draw themo caldera . Get it going . I don 't care what it takes . Thanks . We should continue our work on the rocket . That is our priority . This HAARP device is a waste of time . I 've known Shaw a long time . Doesn 't help anyone to second-guess her . This is a mistake . If we don 't stop the sharks , it won 't matter if the rocket works . There won 't be any of us left . Here . Thanks . Hey , hey . Hey . - They 're taking the bait ! - Booyah ! Sorry . She 's wired in . Let 's see if this baby still has some life in her . Come on , baby . Okay . Hello , Unix ! You want to talk to me like that ? What do you think ? Oh , this is some old-school programming . But all the contacts are still good . Can you get the HAARP online ? Oh , yes . She 's cranky , but a firm hand 'll do the trick . This is Vestron calling for Osprey . Come in . This is Shaw . Go ahead . The HAARP 's online , but Ishi tells me we only got one run at this . Okay , excellent . Let me know when it 's ready . Stand by for my command to fire the transmitter . Sir , I want to voice my reservation on firing this thing . Duly noted , but we don 't have a choice . Do what you can to minimize adverse effect at the station . - I want all hands on this . - Yes , sir . Nichols is nearing her drop zone . The HAARP must be ready when the device is in place . I got you , sir . It will be ready . - We 're leaving ? - We have to trigger this thing remotely . Didn 't Shaw say to sever all connection between the HAARP and Vestron control ? How will we set it off without a direct link ? If we set it up while we 're still connected , Vestron ... I know ! We have to get everyone on severing all connections through the main facility and the HAARP transmitter , but we leave one line tethered for control . When we set it off , we disconnect . - We shouldn 't have any blowback . - Are you sure of that ? No one 's used this thing in years . There 's no telling what would happen when we set it off . The magnitude of power emitted from this thing could have very real collateral damage to anyone nearby . Remote trigger is the only way to do this . She 's planted the device . We need to give her three minutes to get away from the blast radius . Is that enough time ? Yes . The process isn 't instantaneous . Once we 've triggered the HAARP , we bounce a beam of energy at the volcano . It takes a variable amount of time for the volcano to erupt . She 's going to be safe , right ? There 's always a margin for error , but just get us there . She 'll be there . Vestron Station , this is Shaw on the Osprey . This is Caroline at Vestron . Go ahead . The device has been deployed and is in position . - Are you ready to trigger the HAARP ? - All systems go on your command . Has Vestron been separated from the HAARP facility ? Is everything with the rocket shielded ? Not exactly . We 're running a line in for ignition to trigger the HAARP . I told you to isolate that facility . I know , and I was the first one to agree with that plan , but after inspecting the HAARP transmitter , it 's too risky to have someone over there setting it off . It has to be done this way . Copy that . I 'll leave it to you . She 's cleared the safe zone , so ... She 's cleared the zone . On my mark . Yes , sir . We are ready to proceed . 10 , 9 , 8 ... 7 , 6 , 5 ... 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Fire ! Yeah ! - Do we disconnect ? - Negative . I have to steer the beam once it reaches the ionosphere . Atmospheric conditions influences the path . We need to do this now ! Not yet . I can 't guarantee it will hit its target . We can 't stay connected much longer . We 'll lose everything ! I need one minute to focus the beam . We don 't have one more minute ! We 're losing it ! Come on , baby ! Ishi , we can 't remain connected any longer ! On target now ! Beam is on target ! Disconnect ! - Whoo ! - Yeah ! Oh , my gosh , look at that ! - Oh , wow . - See ? - Unreal . - Yahoo ! Hey ! Look at that ! - Whoo-hoo ! Yeah ! - Hey , Shaw ! - Barrick , come and have a look ! - Get in . Quickly . Quickly . Barr ... where you going ? Barr ... Wait ! You 're not heading towards that , are you ? We don 't bow to the wave , she 'll capsize us . Well , then , let 's just bow to the flipping wave and then bugger off back that way , shall we ? Just hold on to something . Barrick ! Don 't look , sweetheart . - Come on . - Oh , Christ . - Sit down . - Ah , you sit down ! - Sit down ! - I 'll sit down . Caroline ? Caroline ? Caroline , can you hear me ? How 'd we do ? Oh , when the HAARP went off , it sent an E.M.P. pulse sideways and upwards . Power 's out . Systems are down . We didn 't disconnect in time . No , we did ... but I don 't think it mattered . The brunt of it hit right here where we are at . How 's the rocket ? Structurally , sound . If we can get the iridium cases from the Osprey we 're good to launch . However ... without power , we 're dead in the water . What about wave kinetic energy harvesters ... or solar cells ? Well , mechanically , they are sound , but the batteries used for storing the energy is fried . So we have no way of storing the energy we harvest ? What about direct power from the harvesters ? The current generator is too weak . So what you 're saying is that we can generate energy , but we have ... - ... no way of storing it ? - Yes , that 's correct . What about our target ? Have you heard anything from Osprey ? Not yet . We 're working on backup communications as we speak . Good . We need to get Shaw on the horn . - Vestron Station 's not responding . - What does that mean ? Probably that they took an E.M.P. hit . What about Dr. Nichols ? We 're gonna have to ride the wave out . We 'll fetch her after . Tell me you 've ridden waves out like this before . Not like this . Definitely not like this . We need more power ! Go and check the fuel lines . You night have to pump it manually . No , I 'll go . You need Shaw here . Whoa ! I 'll go . Got some problem with your throttle . Come on . Better get secured . Um ... Okay . Yes ! Put your arm through . Just ... get this round . Get this round . Get this round . Get this round . Okay . - Okay . - Shaw , I need more power ! It 's maxed out ! There we go . There we go . There we go . Come on . Yeah ! Come on , girl . Come on ! Yeah ! Yes ! Yes ! Good job , girl . I 've spotted her ! She 's in the water ! Back of the boat ! Yeah . I 'm going to tag that shark ! Come on . Get in . Get in . Hold on to something . Come on , baby . Come on , baby . Come on . I think this should work . No need . ... for the shark-attracting device , but we didn 't touch the iridium . Thanks . We 'll get these into the final welds on the scrubbers A.S.A.P. What 's the status of the rocket ? This is the last component we were waiting for . - But we have a bigger issue . - I noticed . Power . May take two to three days to get electrical up and running . We can 't wait that long . We 'll lose our window to launch . We know , but it 's worse than that . Go on . The destruction caused by the E.M.P. surge did more than just damage our electrical . It fused the motors that run the pumps that keep Vestron above water . Vestron is sinking . - What about the rocket ? - I advise dismantling ... and transport essential components out with your vessel . How heavy is that thing ? My boat can only carry so much . Vestron is sinking . Without the pumps , this place will be underwater within 48 hours . Then we need to launch the rocket before then . Sir , I don 't think you understand . We don 't know at what point this platform becomes unstable . You 'll risk losing our rocket , everything we have been working for . This could work . We only need to find enough power for ignition . After that , the rocket will power itself . Doc ... my boat 's got power . It 's not enough . Sir , I know you 've put a lot into this . We all have . But to risk it all on one final shot is not ... Listen , Dr. Nichols says that this is the launch window . We can 't wait . This planet can 't wait . It gets hotter every day , and the hotter it gets , the less chance we have of success . We 're at tipping point . We 've got one chance , and it 's now . So what 's your plan to power the rocket to ignition ? Well , the shark has displayed some powerful bioelectric characteristics . Um , in our last encounter , I actually managed to radio tag the shark , which not only monitors the temperature , but also fluctuations in the electric field . We all know what an electric eel is , yeah ? They use electrical pulses to stun their prey . Right . Well , this shark doesn 't have that particular capability , but it does have other capabilities . We believe that it 's communicating with its surrounding sharks by completely overwhelming circuits of the ampullae de Lorenzini . Thing is , is that sharks don 't normally use their electro-sensing organs until the moment before they bite their prey , and they need to be in close proximity for it to be able to work . It 's not like their sense of smell . Their ampullae is actually quite weak , so ... the fact that our shark is broadcasting electromagnetic signals to a shark that can detect it from distances , I mean , it must have ... a very powerful electro-transmitting organ . Now this is what my sensor picked up . A series of pulses that completely overwhelm our sensors . I mean , we 're talking about kilojoules of energy here . You want to jumpstart the rocket by using the power from a shark ? - Come on ! - Look at the readouts . Can you correlate the pulses to the behavior ? What 's this peak right here ? When I staring firing at the alpha shark , the smaller ones started defending him . That 's the peak . If we record enough of these signals , we may be able to decipher the code that the alpha shark is using to control the other sharks . Yep . Ishiro , get that rocket ready to launch ! Munro , follow me ! Sir , with your permission , I 'd like to stay behind and monitor the shark 's bioelectrics . I think we could use it against him . You get that shark to follow me . I don 't care what it takes . How exactly are you gonna control the shark ? We don 't need to control it . We just need to mimic it . If we figure out the signal it uses to send a command to attack , we become the alpha shark . Quick . She 's welded in . Come on . Let 's get this on the rocket . - You got this ? - Yeah . Munro . I 'm sorry I never did this sooner . Wait . Okay , go . Come on . Gotta go , go , go . Oh ! Oh , my God . Uh , yeah , yeah . In here . In here . Get in here . Now stay down . Okay , stay down , okay ? You stay here till I come and get you , all right ? Come on , mate ! Come on . Stop ! Help me . Help me . She 's close . Lots of fast bursts . I got it ! Micropulses . Directional micropulses . That 's how she 's doing it . I got it ! I got the code ! Come over here ! Come on ! What 's she doing ? Come on ! Shaw ! - Get out of there ! - Come on . Shaw ! Yes , yes , yes . Initiating countdown . 15 , 14 , 13 ... 12 , 11 , 10 ... 9 , 8 , 7 6 , 5 , 4 ... 3 , 2 , 1 . Come on ! I 've recorded the signals . I 've reconfigured the hydrophone to transmit . We should be able to send the signal like this . If it works , the school will attack the alpha . It 's working . It 's working . It 's not working . Something 's wrong . Doc , we gotta go . She 's coming for us . She 's targeting us ! We gotta go . Get out of here ! It 's gonna be okay . Come on . We 've still got a few escape boats left . We can get away before it goes down . Let 's get out of here .

Your dad said to stay in the house , And we have to stay in the house . For how long ? I don 't know . I could make up a number . I mean , just think of it as a vacation . It 's exciting .

Normally , you save somebody 's life , they say " thank you . " Come to think of it , Your husband never thanked me , either . And he 's gotten a lot of special treatment in this town . I 've had it about up to here With my patience for the burkes . I think it 's time for you to leave . Okay . It is your house . As long ... As you and your husband remember This is my town .

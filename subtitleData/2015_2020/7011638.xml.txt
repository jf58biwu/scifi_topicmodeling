 You what ? I said , is the kebab such a good idea ? I drive with one hand , darling , don 't worry , you 're safe with me . It 's you I 'm thinking about . All that saturated fat . It 's not good for your arteries . I 'm here for a good time , not a long time . I said , I 'm here for a good time , not a long time . Sure this is where you want dropped ? Yeah . You could get attacked out here on your own . I 'm fine . It 's 25 quid , then . Oh ! Oi ! Come here ! ♪ Fortune is a fickle friend Here today and then gone again ♪ ♪ A good time girl , when it hurts ♪ ♪ Is nowhere to be found ♪ ♪ Ha , ha , ha , ha ♪ ♪ She 's laughing in your face ♪ ♪ When you think that you 've got it made ♪ ♪ Patient with your life , now Careful with your pride ♪ ♪ Hold tight ♪ ♪ This could be a wild ride It could be a late night ♪ ♪ Who is the underdog ♪ ♪ And who 's gonna be the lucky one ? ♪ It 's rather creepy , you staring at me like this . You may kiss me now . I need a shower . Me , too . You can 't , it 's my brother 's place . So , stay dirty . I need to go to work . I 'll call Rui . He 's here tonight . Harry ? What are you doing , tonight ? I don 't know , I 'll call you later . I want to talk ... about Isabella . I don 't know who you 're talking about . She 's literally calling you , right now . That 's not my phone . Oh . Your name is Rui Hirota ... No , it isn 't . OK . When you 're ready to talk , let me know . What time did you get in at last night ? Late . Oh . Er ... - Hello . - Hi , you must be Rich . I didn 't realise Harry had ... a friend staying over . Isabella . - Nice to meet you . - So , you hear lots about me ? Oh , lots . It 's great to finally meet you . Coffee ? No , I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to love you and leave you . I have a taxi outside . But it 's really nice to meet you . And I hope that we spend more time together , soon . OK . Bye . She gone ? - Yes . - Thanks . Well , she seems ... interesting . That 's one word for her . Foreign , classy , beautiful , how do you manage it ? I honestly wouldn 't know where to start . Well , imagine I already know about your childhood , your failed marriage and your recent homelessness . Maybe it 's a language barrier . Yeah , maybe she doesn 't understand a single word you 're saying . - That 's why it 's working out so well . - Funny Oh , come on . She 's gorgeous ! What have you possibly got to complain about ? I 'm not sure , that 's the problem . The amount of relationships you 've screwed up because she likes some - silly cocktail or doesn 't like Man U. - No , no , no , this is more ... She might be ... So ... ? So ... ? So , you need to find out for sure . Because if she is a good one , you don 't want to let her go . - Morning . - Morning . Dog walker found him floating , first thing . Do we have an ID ? Suri and Orwell are checking out the taxi , we think it 's his . So , you heard about Steve ? No . What 's he done , now ? He 's requested a transfer . Buster Wiley , date of birth eighth of the fifth , ' 66 . I told him to think on it a couple of days . He might change his mind if he felt less isolated from the team . Doesn 't look like he 's been in the water that long , does it ? Harry , did you hear me ? I 'm not sure what I can do . You know , I thought you might be a little more understanding of the redemptive power of second chances . You 're saying Buster topped himself ? Jumped off the railway bridge ? Cab 's registered to a B Wiley . Married , two kids in their 20s . Also , he 's got a dash cam . Could be useful . Check it out , Steve . Daisy ? Hello , love . You all right ? Mum says you think you 've got a magic bracelet . This ? You skipped school to ask me a stupid question like that ? You think you 've got problems , Dad ? - Everyone has problems . - Tell me about it . You can talk to me about anything , you know . I mean , if you ever need to . I don 't need to talk . I just wanted to know that you weren 't going insane . Do I look insane ? Come home , then . - Stop being an arse . - I can 't . Come home , I mean . Come on ... I 'll drop you back to school . So , what we 're looking at ? Asphyxiation , caused by aspiration of fluid . In this case , canal water , into the air passages as a result of submersion . - He drowned . - Anyone else involved ? Well , there 's no signs of a struggle . No cuts or bruises or lesions inconsistent with a death by drowning . What about this scar ? - An operation ? - Heart bypass , relatively fresh , too . When do we get the tox report ? Oh , it 'll be a while , I 'm afraid . They 're backed up . I 'm still waiting for reports from two weeks ago . Can you try and speed it up ? I 'd like to clear this up as quick as possible , so we can solve some real murders . I can certainly try , DI Clayton . Good lad . How was the pathologist ? Waiting on the tox report , you ? Yeah , I extracted that dash cam footage you asked for . Oh , yeah ? So , what did you get ? Apart from one very sad cabbie . Have a look . - Who 's she ? - That is his last fare . Rewind . Stop it there . Can you not get a clearer image than that ? That 's all we have . So , how does a 15-stone man chasing a girl half his size end up in the water ? He goes for her , she pushes him in ? Either way , this isn 't suicide . - Great work , Steve . - Maybe it 's not . We need to find her . You seem upset . Can I help ? I 've just got a bit of a hangover . You look familiar . Do I know you from somewhere ? - Maybe from a meeting . - Oh , God ! Forget I said I had a hangover , will you ? I won 't say a word . How long since you were sober ? Are you hearing me ? - We 're just talking . - You are . You had a liver transplant . How do you know that ? You mentioned it in a meeting . Did I ? I didn 't think I ... You know , there are thousands of people waiting for organ transplants . Oh , God , you don 't need to make me feel bad , OK ? I honestly couldn 't feel worse . Saying you feel bad isn 't enough . Which meeting did you come to ? You have to change , Julie . - Which one ? - Paddington . I 've never been to a meeting in Paddington . Harry ? Jonny . I 'm looking for my wife . I didn 't know you 'd be entertaining . - Behave . - Daisy about ? I thought I 'd run her to school . No , she 's got hockey today before classes . You 've missed her . Hockey ? ! Since when ? She 's very good , you should go and watch her play . At least it keeps her off that bloody computer . Anna , I 've said it before , it 's nothing to worry about . - It 's perfectly normal . - What 's up ? I know , I know , I 'm just being hypersensitive because of everything that happened with ... Oh , is she having difficulty adjusting to Jonny ? No . She 's just always upstairs with the door shut . She 's 13 years old . I 'd think there was something up , if she wasn 't . Exactly what I said . Look , why don 't I go upstairs and finish getting dressed ? It 's just , every time I ... .. try and have a look , she just closes the laptop . Well , she doesn 't want her mum to see her Instagram or ... I know , I know , I get it . I wouldn 't want my mum reading my diary . It 's just there 's something about the urgency with which she closes it . - You checked her history ? - Suspiciously clean . You want me to take a look ? Be discreet , will you ? I am a professional . What ? _ _ Rui ? Yes ? I 'm calling to let you know that someone checked for your name on the Interpol system . The user was a DI Harry Clayton . - Miss Augustine ... - I heard you . - Should I take care of this ? - No , I 'll do it . Would you keep an eye on him and let me know where he is at all times ? Thank you . She 'd kill me if I talked . - I 'll kill you . - I haven 't done anything wrong . You help her kill people . No , I don 't . I just drive , and she doesn 't kill anyone . Oh , so she just wants them dead and somehow they die ? So you know it already ? You don 't need me to tell you what she is . Really ? What 's that ? Magnificent . No , she 's just a thug in a posh frock . You 're just jealous . Tell me everything you know , and you can go back to her . - Afternoon . - She has an operation scar , like Buster . That 's right . This poor girl was on her second liver . She 'd had a transplant ? Oh , watch out , Suri , he 's catching up with you - She 's so young . - Hmm . Now , this is what you want to know . Ever hear of Pentaprevin ? Big centre-half , played for Lamiakos . It 's a short-acting skeletal muscle relaxant , mostly used in hospitals . What for ? It 's used in tandem with a sedative to anaesthetise patients before surgery , hugely specialised . Now , look here . I have to confess , I missed this on my first pass , but , after the tox report showed Pentaprevin in Buster 's system , I had another look . What are we looking at ? There , do you see ? I think that is a needle mark . What ? Does she have , erm ... - Pentaprevin ? - Yeah . Oh , I 'd need a tox report . - How long ? - Here 's one I prepared earlier . Good boy . And ... ? Pentaprevin , yes . Now , look at this . See ? So they 're related ? You 're the detectives . But one other thing she 'd been drinking , which is very naughty if you 've had a liver transplant . All right . So , were they poisoned or were they drowned ? Both . I think they were incapacitated by the Pentaprevin , then thrown in the water . So , they were conscious , but they couldn 't save themselves ? Exactly . It 's a terrible way to die . You know you 're drowning , but you just can 't move . Jesus . Yes , hello . This is Detective Steve Orwell with the Murder Investigation Squad . I 'm looking to speak to someone in the anaesthesiology department . I 've got a list here of all the deaths on Regent 's Canal in the last 18 months . Where do I start ? Can I leave my number and ask ... ? Both of our victims had had major surgery , so check the list , see if anyone matches that profile . There are more deaths in the canals than you think . Well , crosscheck the names with their medical records to see what that throws up . I 'm feeling lucky . What about our suspect , the lady in the black coat ? Now , well , your footage didn 't offer us much , did it ? Bingo . Daniel Green , three weeks ago ... 50s , body in canal , suspected suicide . He was receiving regular treatment from a private hospital called the - Regent Clinic . - Did he have a transplant , or what ? I don 't know , it doesn 't say . Right , let 's go . You keep bashing the phones , big lad . How come I work my arse off and you just get lucky ? We 're here to discuss one of your patients with you . Daniel Green . I doubt I could help you , what with doctor-patient confidentiality . Let 's see how we go , shall we ? Before he died , was Mr Green depressed ? Well , he was suffering from terminal cancer , so I don 't think it 's a stretch to say he wasn 't in the highest of spirits . I understand he recently had a major operation . As I 've said , I can 't discuss a patient 's medical details . Well , you know , I can come back here with a warrant for the information , bring 30 policemen , uniforms , we 'll stick around here for a while . What would you prefer ? He 'd had a successful lung transplant . It 's an extremely rare procedure , but he could afford it . How much does this treatment cost ? Well , I 'm not at liberty to discuss that . But I doubt I could afford one . If he paid all that money for a transplant , why would you think he was suicidal ? One of the doctors saw him smoking outside the hospital , post-operation . None of us could believe it , really . Felt like he was sticking two fingers up at God . Do you use Pentaprevin here ? We do . Why do you ask ? We 'll need the names and addresses of any staff that might have access . I can 't give you those , it 's confidential . That 's funny , that thing you do . - I 'm sorry ? - You know , when your eyes turn away . Dry mouth , swallow . You 're doing it now . Not much of a poker face . Whatever it is you 're hiding has got very little to do with doctor-patient confidentiality , wouldn 't you say so , Dr Jones ? We had to let someone go recently , someone who would have had access . - How long ago ? - About a month . She was a nurse at the practice . What was her name ? Scarlett Cartmell . Why did you sack her ? She was caught stealing drugs . - Pentaprevin ? - Yes , and a variety of other substances . - She was an addict . - I take it you reported this ? There was concern raised over the potential public relations fallout . Write down Scarlett Cartmell 's details now . Do you think she 's our woman in black ? - Well , it 's like looking likely . - What 's her motive ? She loses her job , feels hard done by , takes it out on others who have had second chances but squandered them . Buster Wiley , he kept eating kebabs , his wife said as much , Julie Tracey , she kept drinking , Daniel Green kept smoking . Jesus . She 's killing addicts . What 's the matter , think you 're next on the list ? No I ... - I 'm not an addict . - Sure I 'm ... You 've got a lot more gobby in the last month , you know ? Scarlett Cartmell , police , open up . Right , I 'll have to break it down , stand back . Well , I can close it again if you really want to break it down . As I said , gobby . Scarlett ? Jesus ! God . Suri ? SHE GAGS It looks like an overdose . Approximate time of death ? I 'd say she 's been lying there for a good three , four weeks , if I had to guess , which , basically , I do . So she 's not our killer . - Well , thanks for coming down . - That 's fine . It was the right call . Her body 's too delicate to move . Difficult to do an autopsy on soup . Right , Ralph . How are we getting on ? Almost everything on the list that Kenneth gave us is accounted for . Sir . Almost ? We 're missing some morphine and the Pentaprevin . Well , looks like Scarlett had the morphine . So our killer is still out there ? Yep , with the stolen Pentaprevin . Hello ? Excuse me . 'You 're not avoiding me , are you ? ' - Me ? Never . - ' Great ' . 'Shall we meet up ? ' - Sure . When ? - ' How about right now ? ' - What are you doing here ? - Oh , I was just out for a walk . My driver seems to have taken the day off . Come here . In . So ? How are you here ? This is a crime scene . A murder scene . I wanted to see you , Harry , and ... I tend to get what I want . I 've had this for ten years . Finding you is ... Plus , I 've gathered friends around me , people who 'll do anything . But I guess the honeymoon is over . That 's why you did an Interpol check on me . I told you I have friends , but at least I 'm being honest with you , which makes one of us . And then there was that chat the other night , full of hints and innuendos about a man dying . Was that you ? Do I kill people ? Do you ? What does my police record say ? It 's clean . Spotless . Almost artificially so . What about Rui , my driver ? What have you done with him ? Nothing . Looks like we both have trust issues , then . I 'm not sure what I feel about you working . On the one hand , the authority 's undeniably a turn-on . On the other , you 're not much fun . I 've only ever been honest with you , Harry . - What are you afraid of ? - I shouldn 't be doing this . Then stop me . Sorry , sir , sorry to bother you , but we need to move the van . Come home with me . - I can 't . - Please . Sir ? I am trying to question a witness here , fuckin ' eejits , move ! Sorry , sir . Morning , what 's the craic ? Got a possible lead , Emily Sorkin , works at the clinic , knew Scarlett , had access to the drugs , pretty good height match for the figure in the video . We reckon she could be our woman in black . Have you got an address ? Good . Suri , let 's check her out . I think since Steve did the heavy lifting , he should go . - Orwell ? - I 'll go with him . - OK , don 't lose her . - I 'm sure we 'll be fine . If you wanted , you could break the news to Scarlett 's next of kin . Anna ! Oh , hello . That 's such a coincidence . Are you drinking alone ? I 'm waiting for Jonny , he 's , um , he 's been held up in traffic . Well , I 'm on my own , so it 's perfect . I admire you . Really ? Yeah , well , not just because of your work . After everything Harry did to you , you still make time for him , and let him be with your daughter . You 're almost too kind . Yes , well , he 's hard to get rid of . But he is worth sticking with , isn 't he ? I sometimes worry that I 'm betting on the wrong guy . - Your bracelet ... - Hmm - Where 'd you get it ? - It 's a gift from Harry , actually . It 's an acquired taste , but I do like it . Harry ? Buying jewellery ? Wow ! I 'm a bit worried that my wrist will turn green . Yes , well , I wouldn 't worry too much about Harry , if I were you . You 've clearly got him in a very good place indeed . So sorry I 'm late , darling . The most incredible set of circumstances delayed me . You wouldn 't believe ... So , this new Suri ... What new Suri ? Well , the one who shouts down her boss and doesn 't do what she 's told . I 'm not ! That 's , that 's not ... No , no , no , it 's good , it 's good . I mean , don 't go full Harry Clayton on us , but ... No , I like it . Come on . Do you want to check around back ? You check round the back . - Emily Sorkin ? - Yes . - Clare Cartmell ? - Yes ? I 'm DI Harry Clayton . I 'm afraid I have some bad news . May I come in ? - Er , yes , yes , of course , come in . - Thank you . Er , what 's this about ? It 's about your sister , Scarlett . What 's happened ? I 'm sorry to say she 's been found dead in her flat . Right . I would like to tell you that this is a surprise , but it isn 't . Was it an overdose ? Yes . Were you close ? Sometimes . I ... I understand how destructive addiction is . I don 't believe in addiction . You don 't ? I don 't believe it 's a disease , anyway . It 's a choice . A continuing series of choices . My sister wasn 't ill , I 'm afraid . She just liked to get high . It 's a bit more complicated than that , surely ? If addiction was a brain disease , the neurologists would be able to find evidence backing it up , but they can 't . The phrase , the idea , addiction is merely an abdication of responsibility . Sorry , I ... You must think I 'm a monster ? No . Ms Cartmell , I deal with real monsters every day . Look , I 'm sorry , but I really do have to get to work . No , of course , of course . What work do you do , by the way ? I am an anaesthetist . Ah , a medical family . Did you ever work with Scarlett ? - No . - Did you work at the Regent Clinic ? Well , here 's my card . Please , if you feel I can help in any way , give me call . One thing , uhm do you happen to have a recent photo of Scarlett ? - I 'm afraid not . - An old one , maybe ? Um , would it be all right if I dropped it into the station ? As I said , I 'm running late . I 'm sorry , but do you mind getting it now ? Of course . _ _ No good , I 'm afraid , she had a solid alibi . Maybe our murderer never worked at the Regent Clinic . I 'm going to look into locums , see if there 's a link there . Where 's Harry ? He 's paying his condolences to Scarlett 's sister . No , really , he is . All right . Go through the list of staff from other hospitals , see how many doors we 're going to need to knock . Sir . 'Hi , this is Harry Clayton , please leave a message ... ' - I 've got something . - What is it ? I 've been going through the agency list of all the locums - that work at the Regent Clinic ? - And ... ? There 's an anaesthetist there who also does shifts at the hospital where Buster Wiley had his heart surgery , and the infirmary where Julie Tracey had her transplant . - A woman ? - Yeah , and her name is Clare Cartmell . There 's his car . It 's Harry 's ! I didn 't kill Scarlett . She called me after she lost her job . Wanted money . I wasn 't going to help . If you keep giving money to people like that , they never get better . But she was my sister , and I loved her , so I went round to see her . And there she was , dead in the bath . And next to her was the Pentaprevin . I do work at the Regent Clinic , every now and then , as a locum . I was going in , and there was Daniel Green , sucking on a cigarette outside . I looked at him , and I thought about my sister and afterwards , it felt like justice . I am so sorry , I didn 't get a chance to stop . Oh , it 's fine . No , no , come on , give me your insurance details , - and I 'll give you mine . - No , no , honestly , it 's fine . It 's just a scratch . No , come on , I totally damaged your bumper ! - Don 't worry about it . - Please , I insist ! I 'm fully comp . Wait ! I 'd like to report an accident . All right , we search the canal , that 's where she dumps her bodies . I want every available unit searching every inch of it , that 's eight and a half miles , and we have no time , so go , now ! 'Information of a damage-only accident involving vehicle registered to 'Clare Cartmell in the last five or six minutes . The vehicle has left the scene , over . ' Received , what 's the location ? Over . 'Eastway junction with Great Eastern Road , 'stand by for further details , over . ' That 's the Stratford end of the canal , let 's go . The others were already drowning , thrashing about , dragging society down with them . Stuffing your face with a kebab like that . I mean , that 's a suicide note , really , isn 't it ? I 'm sorry , but you 're all trying to stop me , and I 'm right . I know I am . - It should have been me . It 's my fault . - Shut up . - I should have gone , not Harry . - Yeah , and then we 'd be looking for you . He 'll be all right . It 's Harry , he 's always all right . CAR HORN BLARES Whoa , whoa , whoa , Steve ! What the fuck ? Harry ! Police ! Stop ! Stop ! - Stop it ! - Why aren 't you saving your colleague ? Is he dead ? Is he ? Come on ! Harry ? OK . OK , OK , you 're all right . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . So , look , Steve , we 've had our differences , haven 't we ? Really ? What ? " We 've had our differences , but I 've developed a grudging respect for you , Steve , " and now I , the almighty Harry Clayton , " have decided to bestow upon you my gratitude and my forgiveness . " You may retract your transfer " . Something along those lines ? Almost exactly along those lines . Yeah . Hey , guess what ? I don 't care . I don 't care if you want me to go or stay . My leaving 's got nothing to do with you . You 're not the centre of the universe , mate . - I know that . - You might . She doesn 't . She is a very good police officer . You are a bad influence on her . Look , are you both certain you don 't want a hospital checkup ? Chief , we 're fine . Thank you . Oh ... Oh , um ... I should take this . So , ah , apparently I owe you a thank-you card or something ? I 'll take the something . Do you trust me now ? My colleagues were telling me about this madwoman , she jumped out in front of their car , it 's a miracle they didn 't kill her , so they say . As far as trusting you goes I might be getting there . Well , I owe you an apology . My little Rui is back . Poor boy got mugged and ended up in hospital . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'll make him all better . When can I make you all better , Harry ? I can 't tonight , I 've got Daisy , sorry , but ... - soon . - OK , just don 't keep a girl waiting . Yep . Oh , there she is ! Hello , Dais . Mwah ! I 've just been telling Daisy about digital effects , about how you can manipulate anything these days with digital effects . Great . And I 've been telling Uncle Rich that I 'm nearly 14 , and I know all about CGI . Sorry , am I missing something ? Somebody posted this online . Oh . Right . Can 't get away with anything these days . Dad , I want you to tell me the truth . OK . Is that really a magic bracelet ? Yes . It is . Cool . Show me . OK . - Heads or tails - Heads . Tails . Call again . Heads . Tails . Again . - Bad luck , Dais . - Dad , this is pathetic . Can 't you jump off a building into a trifle or something ? Just keep watching . I win every time . Oh , and Harry , another staggeringly beautiful woman dropped a package off for you this morning . _ _ People are dying every day in this city . Always by accident . - She is always there . - How many ? - I don 't know . - She kills them ? She wants them dead , and they die . She 's unstoppable , ever since the first . The man who killed her children , what did she do to him ? She nailed him to a tree and slit his throat . Woe betide anyone who crosses Isabella Augustin .

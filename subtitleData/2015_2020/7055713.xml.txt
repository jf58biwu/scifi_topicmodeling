 Previously on " Somewhere Between " ... The killer called your show . He said he had Serena Then the next day in Black Pine Cove , they ... Oh , my God . For one to live , one must die . Mommy 's coming , angel . I came back to eight days before . Is it really you ? Sometimes it 's like you 're asleep and something wakes you up . Who did your brother was responsible for Susanna 's death ? - I killed her ! - Are they gonna kill my dad ? No . I will never let them hurt my baby . The man who 's been killing those women in the city , he 's going to drown my little girl . I need your help to catch him . - We saved her . - I 'm getting the cops ! Come on ! Officer ! Oh , my God . Please , please ! I need your help ! I need your help ! He 's gonna try and kill me ! You have to help me ! What ... Who are you ? _ Where are you ? Can we talk about it when I get home ? Is Serena okay ? What the hell , Laura ? Just tell me . How 's Serena ? Well , you lied to me . You said you were going to the station . Daddy ... I can 't sleep . Hey , what 's , uh ... what 's bothering you , honey ? Nothing . My eyes just won 't close . What 's that ? Oh , it 's just an old thing I 'm giving away to a thrift store . I 'll talk to you later . You know what ? I ... am gonna sing you a song . - No daddy singing ! - Oh , yes . It 'll be so terrible you 'll fall asleep just to get away from it . Or run . So , someone else comes along , just by coincidence , runs into Fiona and stabs her 20 times ? Look , obviously he 's a killer . That 's not in question here . The question is catching him and proving it , and you are not helping . On top of assaulting one of my men . But we 'll leave that aside . So ... you can tell us how you knew what you knew or I can detain you for obstruction . Article 1 Section 2B of the California Constitution says all kinds of things about press and immunity . You want me to pull that up for you ? If he kills another girl , and you knew something that could help her , you can forget obstruction ... I will nail you for complicity . After you . Come on . Let 's go . Why don 't we try the truth ? 'Cause I can 't help Serena from a psych ward . So who does he kill tonight ? Nobody claimed the body . No ID . They found the body in a dumpster in the Financial District . Maybe we scared him off . Want to count on that ? She was wearing a blue wig , and this fuzzy jacket , short , to here . We found a napkin in her pocket . No name . No number . Just a three-headed dog . Cerberus . Guardian of the underworld . You know your mythology . I know my underworld . Could be an unlisted gentleman 's club she worked out of . Cops never found it . Kinda people that go to that kinda club don 't usually talk to the cops . Yeah , but they talk to you . - They talk to people that talk to me . - Nice . Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh ! Whoa . Who did that ? Oh , my God . That 's crazy . You recall the time of death ? No . The next time I 'm headed for a rewind , I 'll take better notes . So what 's the plan ? You call me when you find the three-headed dog , we go there , and we wait . What ? That wasn 't too shabby , when you stabbed him with the pen . A lot of good it did . First time , they found her in the dumpster . The second time , he left her in an alley . We moved the needle on fate . So this time Serena drowns in a lake instead of the bay ? Dear Mrs. Price . I 'm writing to you as one mother to another . Ruby told me that you work for the news . Please put something on your show about my Danny . He is innocent . The articles in this envelope will show you that people with the syndrome my son has are not violent . Think how you would feel if your little girl was going to die . Please open your heart . Sincerely , Grace Jackson . There are more unlisted clubs in this city than there are men who moisturize ! If anybody could find the hypodermic needle in that haystack ... Just where I love going . Back to the swamp you hauled me out of . - Afraid of old enemies ? - Worse . Old friends . Where are you headed , while I 'm hunting three-headed dogs ? I 'm going to make sure I don 't squander my second chance . I didn 't lie to you . I was in the field , following a tip on that story I 'm doing about the killer . It got late and , uh , things got crazy . Mm . You know , watching you the last couple days , I know all about crazy . I 'm worried . When 's the last time you saw your therapist ? I don 't know . Uh ... Too long . - Promise me you 'll go see her . - I promise . Mostly I just need to get rest . I 'm gonna stay in today and snuggle with Serena . You are ? ! That 's right , angel . We can curl up and see what the Mad Hatter 's up to . You 're staying home from work to read with me ? Until I have to go out later on to work on my story . Are you feeling all right ? Hey , Ruby ! - Move over . - Uncle Nico . Why 'd you come to my school ? I missed ya . What 's got you down , sweetheart ? I 'm not allowed to see my friend . And I 'm scared about my dad . Yeah , me too . If I was Elsa , I would make a blizzard over the whole jail and I would turn all the guards into snowmen and my dad and I , we would skate away on the ice , and I 'd bring him back to my palace where no one would ever find us . But I 'm not Elsa . It 's just me and I have 16p11.2 deletion syndrome which makes me trip all the time . Okay ! That 's second bell ! Inside , everyone ! Well , that was quick . I 'll see you soon , okay ? My uncle Nico came to see me , Mr. DeBray . He missed me so he came to see me . Oh , that 's wonderful , Ruby . Nice to meet you , Uncle Nico . Pleasure 's mine . Hey . Come on . Goodbye , Elsa . Susanna was strangled before she was stabbed , with the scarf she was wearing . There were yellow silk fibers in the wounds on her neck . Uh , is my son 's DNA on the scarf too ? Like you say it is on the knife ? We don 't know . The scarf is missing . - Of course it is . - Mrs. Jackson ... If you find that scarf , you 'll find the real killer . You cops have all the time in the world to scare him into confessing , but the ... the murder weapon ? " Sorry , ma 'am , it 's missing . " Serena ! Lunch ! Hold the fort for a sec ? I 'll be right back . Okay ? Ow . ♪ My angel is halfway to dreamland ♪ ♪ My angel is drifting asleep ♪ ♪ My angel is halfway to dreamland ♪ ♪ So don 't make a sound or a peep ♪ Did you find it ? Jenny rocks the world . The napkin is from Hounds of Hell . A discreet club in the Financial District where the unpardonable do the unspeakable with the unmentionable . Sounds like your kind of place . Hey ... There 's this thing that killers do . They kill people . And ? You know how much you want Serena alive ? That 's close to how much she wants you alive . Let me go alone . No way . Like Marjorie said , for one to live , one has to die . I 'll meet you in 10 minutes . Hey ... I just got her to sleep , so ... loud noises are punishable by guillotine . Yeah . What 's that ? Uh , persistent citizen . I have to go into work . We 're doing research on victim number six . - Six ? - When did another one happen ? Sorry . Five . I just ... It 's this story . I just got , um ... killer on the brain . You look handsome . You 're beautiful . Mm . I wish I could stay . Yeah , me too . Be safe . I 'll try . Hello , daughter unit . - Hello , father unit . - Hi . Aww . That 's nice . I 'm sorry to wake you up , but turns out I need that yellow scarf after all . And I 'm wondering if you 've seen it . - Yes ! - You did ? I wanted to play with it , but it had all these yucky stains on it , so I washed it all clean . You did . Okay . Let 's , uh ... let 's go back to bed , okay ? There we go . Love you . Here . In case you lost your tracker . What 's the range on this thing ? Somewhere around global . Okay . Welcome to Hounds of Hell . Fire ? Oh , my God ! She could be in there ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hold on ! Hold on ! Wait ! Hey ! You can 't run into a fire ! Help me ! Please ! Help me ! Help me ! Who are you ? Why are we back here ? Because you 're in danger . What are you doing ? ! We have to get out of here ! There 's no fire . It 's just smoke . He did that to keep us from stopping him . What are you talking about ? Who are you ? We 're with the police . We have information someone 's planning on hurting you tonight . Did you arrange to meet a man here ? What ... prove you 're the police . Well , you can believe us ... Or you can end up in the news , like the last five girls . Are you meeting someone here tonight ? ! Yeah . Yeah . But I don 't know who . A guy called and asked me if I would be here tonight . How 'd he get your number ? If a guy wants my number , he knows how to get it . That 's his caller ID . Put it on speaker . Hello ? Hey , Mimi . Sorry I got held up . How about you meet me at Hey Venus in a half an hour ? Yes . Sure . I 'll see you there . Now what ? He wants to meet his date at Hey Venus . Well ... that 's where she 's gonna be . What , you 're just gonna throw her out there like bait ? No . We 're not doing this on our own . What is it ? You have a minute to catch a killer ? Actually , it 's , uh ... it 's occupied . Wow . You should call for backup . I can handle myself . It 's not you I 'm worried about . Let 's go get him . You 're all insane . Yeah . Yeah , but ... with a plan . Which I am not signing on to until you tell me what you know and how you know it . Fine . I lived through an alternate timeline in which my daughter was drowned by the man who 's killing these women . It was so excruciatingly horrible that I killed myself , but instead of dying , this guy fished me out and I woke up a week before I lost my daughter . That 's why I know what I know . - Because ... - Because we went to the future . - Yeah . - Which is why we teamed up . 'Cause people that fall through the time-space continuum , they gotta stick together , you know ? Oh , I could arrest you both right now for so many things . But first , let 's get this guy when he shows up at Hey Venus . Well , you had your hands on the killer last night , which is more than I can say for any of us . Thank you . We are no more than 10 feet from you every second . Yes . Come on . I 'll have an officer take you home . I want you to take Mimi home . I 'm sure the Captain has officers she can throw on that . I only trust you . Please . We can 't change anything if we don 't keep her alive . Be careful . You too . Any idea why a killer would put you on his list ? Maybe he 's my fairy god mother granting a wish . Come on . Don 't say that . Don 't worry , I don 't have the guts yet . Give me two years . That 's when he 's gonna be old enough to come looking for me . It 's better that I 'm gone . He can live his life thinking I was some poor college student who wanted him to have a better life . Instead of a party girl who didn 't have the guts to take him on . - 16 ? - Soon . Yeah . Yeah ... I have a niece that 's gonna be 14 . - Does she like sweaters ? - Yeah . There 's ... this stupid thing that I do - every year on his birthday . - Look at that . Here 's this year 's . I don 't know . Would your niece wear this ? I usually give it to a thrift store . You made that yourself ? The only thing I learned from my mom . That and how to let a man light your cigarette . Take it . Please . It 's very beautiful . Thank you . Um , did you box somebody in ? I think you 're getting towed . Hey ! Hold on ! I 'm coming down ! D ... just ... hold on ! Oh , wait , wait , wait ! For downstairs , to get back in . Take this . - Lock the door . - Okay . Waiting long ? - No . - You 're just the girl I 'm looking for . Police ! On the ground ! She 's a hooker ! What 's the big deal ? ! No stab wound . It 's not him . Mimi ? _ Mimi ? Nice to meet you , Uncle Nico . What does this have to do with Ruby ? Everything . And nothing . If I get locked up , who 's gonna be the man in Ruby 's life ? You ? Stay here . Lost him ? Yeah , but we found each other again . Life got dull without you . I loved it . You 're the teacher ... from Ruby 's school . Why are you following me ? How do you always know where I 'm going to be ? Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Let me out ! I 'm trapped ! Get me out ! I 'm trapped ! Get me out of here ! I 'm trapped ! Get me out ! H-Hey , I smell ... I smell gas ! Get me out of here ! I got so much work to do ! Please ! You can 't win until the price is paid . For one to live , one must die . No ! No , no , no ! No , no , no ! Please ! No ! No ! It was for the children ! Let me out ! Please ! No ! No ! No ! Get me out ! Don 't kill me ! Please ! Let me out ! No ! He has to die ! No ! It 's not the way ! It 's not the way ! Stop ! He has to die ! No ! Get me out ! Get me out ! Get me out ! Get me out ! Grab my legs ! My legs ! No ! He has to die ! How could you let him live ? All the women he 's killed ... and Serena ... Governor 's got nothing on you . He believes in the death penalty . You believe in do-it-yourself . You risked your life for a killer . What 's the Ruby connection ? Why Serena ? He dies , the answers die with him . Caught a good break . Mimi 's alive . She 's in a coma , but she 'll pull through . He didn 't kill her ? Did his best . But nope . She fingers him , and ... You hear that ? There 's no way out of the noose . He can 't hurt Serena . You know how my husband became the DA ? By never being sure there was no way out of the noose . Why am I the one under arrest ? She 's the one who attacked me . Has anybody looked at that ? The EMTs wanted to bandage it , but I told them chicks go crazy over my scars . Yeah . Nothing sexier than festering infection . There 's glass and God knows what in there . Careful . Hey , just hold still . You sound like my mother . Yeah . Well , every mom is everybody 's mother . Ow . Serena really drew the long straw when she got you . The oceans of hell you 've had to slog through for her ... Your mother would do the same thing for you . She would if I was my brother . Wh ... Where 's Serena ? I , uh ... I had Barry come over . Uh , Captain ... Sarneau , right ? Mm . Hello , Mr. Price . Uh , is the man you 're holding the killer ? - All five women ? - Mm-hmm . No question whatsoever . Good . Without your wife , we never would 've collared him . Do you need anything more from Mrs. Price ? Nah , she 's given her statement , I just need her to sign it . Good . I 'll take her home , and then I 'll give you a call . We 'll get the charges in front of Judge Vasquez before he has his morning coffee . No leaks to the press until we indict . - Okay . - Good . You ready ? - Yes . - Good . Thank you . - I put the man 's brother on death row . - I know . - So what does he want from you ? - Nothing . He was just helping me out with my story , as a private detective . - It 's just a coincidence . - Coincidence . Two days after his mother ambushed me in front of my office . But let 's move on . What kind of story calls for dressing up like a $ 10 hooker and burning suspects alive in the middle of the night ? We had a chance to catch him , and we caught him . " We ? " Yeah , me and the police . And Nico Jackson . I 've had an hour of sleep in three days ... Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . I 'm worried about you . I 'm just trying to understand . You know I 'm proud of you . For helping catch him . Just make sure he stays caught . Nothing ? You have nothing for me ? Hm . Well , silence is your client 's right , but you know what silence looks like to a jury . I can 't compel my client to speak . But I can speak . And I can tell you that my client has now been attacked , two nights in a row , by the same woman . He abducted her . Yes , I understand that she 's making that claim . Which is substantiated only by her own statement . And yet somehow , you 're hoping to pin five murders on my client . Do you have any other questions for me , Captain ? How many days are we losing you for ? Just until I know Serena 's completely recovered from her allergy attack . Tell Auntie Mara I send her a big hug and a kiss ! Tell her I hear it and I send her one right back . Come back as soon as you can , okay ? I will . Hug from me too . We 're all set , angel . You , me , and whatever we feel like doing . But I actually want to go to school today . We have art , and I haven 't finished my diorama yet . We can make our own dioramas . Hi . Uh , we 're all set with Vasquez , as soon as we ... Mm-hmm . What 's wrong ? We 're on our way . - Did he escape ? - Not that bad . But almost . Yeah ? You 're not gonna like this . Well , that 's an easy guess . I don 't like anything before 11 : 00 in the morning . Not a single chromosome of DeBray 's DNA showed up in Mimi 's apartment . What ? Your exact words were " no question whatsoever . " I was going on the information that we had at the time . And now I have to go in front of a superior-court judge and say yes , Your Honor , there 's no physical evidence tying the suspect I 've filed charges against to this crime . Or any of the other murders . - What about the clothes ? - Nothing . Oh , come on . He ... He had her blood on his jacket . It was ... It was green . It had a zipper . What was he wearing when you arrested him ? Uh ... navy shirt . He took off the jacket while he was running . We searched every square millimeter between Mimi 's place and where he got in the car for the knife . Not likely we 'd miss a bloody jacket . He could 've tossed it in a car . Did you search every car ? I cannot build a case on could have . You can build a case on witnesses , Tom . - Witnesses . - Yes . Right . One 's in a coma . One has admitted to assaulting the suspect . Twice . One was fired from the police for the brutal beating of a citizen . So either somebody finds a green jacket soaked in the victim 's DNA by tonight or I 'm calling off the hearing . Tom , there has to be another way to charge him . - Charge him ? - Yeah . Once I cancel the hearing for lack of evidence , I won 't have a way to hold him . He 's a trophy keeper . The team tore this guy 's apartment to pieces . All right , if he had a girl 's ring in there , they would 've found it . " The team " couldn 't find their own ass with GPS and a bloodhound . Come on , hermano , all I 'm asking for is the code to the lock on Haskell 's apartment . I 'm sorry to remind you , but you ain 't a cop anymore . Anything you dig up blows the chain of custody . Anything I dig up goes right back where I dug it . And then you get an irresistible hunch , you march in all official-like , you bring home the inculpatory bacon , and you get the honor and glory you so richly deserve . If you get caught tampering , he walks and you 're felons . Give me the code . Lock 's intact , ma 'am . You sure the sound was from in here ? Believe me , officer , the walls in this building ? I know what shoes they were wearing . Sounds pretty quiet . Of course they 're quiet now . They know we 're here . If somebody was in here , they must 've slipped out . This is Officer 249 . We 've done a walk-through . All clear . Found them in the bathroom . It ... it was just a feeling you had ? Yeah , like a , uh ... a hunch . Is that a technical term ? These could be trophies he took from the first five victims . Mm . I 'm sure the families will recognize them . - Tom ... - Hm ? Can you bring them in here ? I can make that happen . Take a close look at the ring and the earring . Tell us if it 's possible the items belonged to your sister , Mr. Lachoisto , or your daughter , Mr. and Mrs. Shrain . We believe we have the man who killed your loved ones . A verifiable identification of this jewelry can help us put him away . Thank you . Would you take a look at these please , Mr. Lachoisto ? Did either of these items belong to your sister ? I 've never seen either of these . Fiona almost never wore jewelry . According to a witness , your sister was wearing a ring the night that she was killed . Not this one . Look at the initials on the band . Who the hell is A.H. ? Wait . Uh , sir , can you please look at the jewelry again ? - Laura ... - Just wait . Wait . Um ... Maybe A.H. was her boyfriend . Can you think for me ? Please , just ... just look at the bag ! - Look at the ba ... - Laura , that 's enough . I 'm sorry . Captain , thank the families for coming in . Of course . Any luck on the bloody jacket ? All right . You know I have no choice . I have to order the release of the detainee . I 'm not giving up . I just don 't have the evidence yet . Thank you . Laura ... Laura ! Laura ! Laura ! What 's the code ? Uh , 2215 . It 's not opening ! Confess now . You killed them all . Why do you keep trying to kill me ? Car , gun , pen , fire ... I ... y ... Wh ... What is your sick obsession with me ? The code 's not working ! Laura ! If you live ... - ... my daughter dies . - Laura ! I saw her dead ! After you killed her ! Ruby 's my favorite student . Why would I hurt her best friend ? Laura ! Laura ! You need to take the safety off . Laura ! Give it ... Okay , okay , okay ! Okay , okay , okay ! Okay , okay , okay ! What the hell ? You have got to get ahold of yourself . If you let him go , he will kill Serena . You have gone completely out of your mind ! - You don 't understand . - Then tell me ! You have no i ... No ! No ! No ! No , you can 't let him go ! - Laura ... - No ! Laura ... If you get arrested , what do I tell Serena ? I will fix this for you . But you are going to get help . Mr. Price , your wife assaulted a suspected . My wife has been under a tremendous amount of stress . May we keep this a family matter ? - Sir , I ... - I 'd be grateful . Or should I ask the chief of police ? Of course . Sir . I have to stay and clean up this mess . You go home , and I 'll talk to you when I get there . You don 't know what you 've done . I love you . We won 't let him out of our sight . We have to be at the hospital when Mimi comes to . I don 't trust the police . We 'll call Jenny . She 'll stay on top of Haskell . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Why is your hand on my person ? Oh , I have a trainload of questions and you , as a person of interest in this screwed-up case , aren 't going anywhere until I get answers . All right . How about we downgrade my classification to witness ? See , the attorney for the suspect is planning on leveling very serious charges against you ... - Come on . - ... for stalking and harassment . So you can talk to me , or I can throw you to those dogs . They can 't keep you here . Yeah , actually they can . I 'll tell my husband ... He 'll upgrade me to suspect . Call Jenny . Stay after Haskell . Go . Come on . Okay . - I 'll be okay . - Okay . - I am so sorry . - Are you all right ? Yes , of course . Apart from being a clumsy oaf . So sorry . Truly .

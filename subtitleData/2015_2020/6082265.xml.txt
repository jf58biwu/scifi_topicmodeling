 Peter : Previously on helix ... There 's no baby . The good doctors from the cdc have developed a serum To combat the illness . Peter : Mass suicide . ( door opening ) what is this ? There has been a change of plans . You can 't do this to me ! I will live forever ! We are responsible for the abbey now . Not you and me , just me . I won 't let you destroy our home . The cdc sent us back for you . You 're being evacuated . This is no longer the only island under quarantine . They 've lost 75 people . We can 't leave . We need to examine this mycotic right away . The mycotics outside the wall are not dying . We need to figure out why . I found this in his stomach . That looks like tree sap . He 's been practically living off it . This gunk may lead to a cure ? It 's the only lead we have . At the very least , we need to get out there and investigate , Find out what this is all about . Tell me what happened to me and my baby . Sister amy : I 'd be happy to give it back to you . You just have to give me something in return , Immortality . ( insects chirping ) Cadmus : When 'll the stew be ready ? It 'll be ready when it 's ready . A meal takes time . I 'm hungry now . You 're always hungry . Not my problem . My problem 's your cooking . You ever gonna make anything edible ? When are you gonna act like a man Instead of sitting here whining ? Looks like shit . Tastes like it , too . Yeah ? Yeah . How does it feel ? What 's that supposed to mean ? ( man yelling ) Ah ! ( man growling ) ( both grunting ) Carol : Get off me ! ( grunting and scuffling ) ( fire crackling ) What are you doing here ? Trying to stay warm . Don 't these coasties know how to keep a frackin ' fire going ? Aren 't you ... Dead ? Checked out ? Taking the ol ' dirt nap ? Don 't look at me . You 're the one dreaming this up . Dig the beard . Very anti-establishment , Screw the man and all that , But , uh , i gotta ask ... What are you trying to prove ? Maybe i just like the way it looks . It makes you look like one of the village people . ( chuckling ) What the hell are you really doing out here , alan ? I 'm trying to stop ilaria . By traipsing through the forest with a bunch of sailors ? Not to mention this kyle guy Who 's trying to get your butt thrown in federal prison . Ilaria have come up with a new pathogen . I 'm not sure why , but i ... Ah , horse shit . You and i both know that ain 't The real reason you 're out here . Of course it is . Humor me . First , you were trying to save julia . Then , you were hunting a bunch of immortals in paris . And now , you 're trying to find a cure for this pathogen . Seems to me like you 're a man in search of a mission . I know why i 'm here , doreen . Oh , i don 't think you do . And you need to wake up . You hear me ? Wake up , alan . Kyle : Wake up . Alan , wake up . Keep at it , i 'll put that boot up your ass . I just figured you might want to stay with the gang here , But you can sleep till noon if you want . Look , we don 't have to get along ... We don 't get along , doc . But we 're in this together , like it or not , So let 's get it done . Winger : You get a headcount ? Okay , take three men , Maintain visual contact , check the perimeter , then uphill . What 's happening ? One of our guys hasn 't reported in . Must have just overslept . Anne : I know you 've been through Unspeakable horror , The loss of friends and loved ones . But i can promise you , We will prevail . Say it with me . All : ( repeating ) we will prevail . When will it be safe for us to eat or drink ? Dr. Farragut has assured me That our remaining food and water supplies Are uncompromised . Why did michael lie to us ? Why did he kill everyone ? What michael did was a terrible mistake . You 're all safe now . The cdc ... Michael said the cdc was here to keep us safe , But they 're the ones that brought the sickness . No . That 's absolutely not true . Sister amy : Lies and more lies . Michael , who called himself our brother , Fell prey to the evil words of the outsiders , And now my mother is following his path . How dare you speak to me that way ? I will speak to you any way i like ! We are no longer afraid of you and michael . For years we leaned on tradition , Went about our work , And reassured ourselves The old ways are the safest ways , The surest ways . But we have been led down a path to ruin . Whole families lost To sickness or poison . The old ways are dead ! The time has come to move on , To open ourselves to our new incarnation . Skeptics and outsiders have done their best To destroy us . And anne ... Has embraced them , even laying with one of them ! ( people murmuring ) That 's not true ! They misled my mother and michael , But they shall not mislead us . Come ! Join me . ( theme music playing ) ( door opening ) ( door closing ) Peter : Anne ? Anne . Your daughter has michael 's gift For empty speech . Not only empty , but cruel . I 'm sorry she singled you out . It was ... Unforgiveable . No need to apologize for amy . Why not ? I 'm her mother . Her failure is my failure . That 's not true . You have to stop blaming yourself for everything that goes on here . I 've spent my life doing exactly what i 've been told . No one ever listened to me , Except when i repeated what michael said . If i disagreed , i was yelled at . But i put up with it because i believed in him . Two days ago in the oubliette , You yelled at me . Anne , i 'm sorry . No , it 's fine . The point is , i yelled back . I felt ... Safe with you . You were right , And you listened . You listened . The survivors of the thinning Aren 't the only ones in need of a savior . What are you gonna do ? I 'm not going down without a fight . Amy may think she has control of the abbey , But i have ... ( phone beeping ) Oh , my god . What is it ? I haven 't had a chance to get up here Since i was trapped in that pit . There must be a hundred new messages . They 're here . They 're already here on the island . Who 's here ? The answer to our problem . ( waves roaring ) I thought you said this hike was an hour tops . An hour as the crow flies . We could have taken the ilaria chopper . Not without raising a dozen red flags . We need to get in , find michael And the infertility biotech quickly and quietly . And what if this michael doesn 't want to cooperate ? Then we reason with him . I haven 't heard from peter in five days . Who knows what kind of shit storm we 're walking into ? I don 't want to use force Unless it 's absolutely necessary . It might be . Ah , dr . Jordan . I thought i might find you here . The curious scientist . Is this some kind of game to you , you crazy bitch ? Uh-uh , language . Do i need to have landry wash your mouth out with soap ? ( lock clicking ) You know , i am willing to give you a trade , If you give me what i want . I can 't make you immortal . I 've never done the procedure . " can 't , " " never " those are self-defeating words . That 's just the kind of negative thinking That can lead to a terrible accident ... Stop it ! How long ... Do you think the child could live outside the jar ? What are you ... Don 't do ... Five minutes ? Don 't ! Stop it ! Two ? Okay , wait , wait ! I 'll ... I 'll do it , whatever you want . I thought you might see the light . Man : ( on radio ) lieutenant commander , we found him . ( soldier retching ) Soldier : Oh , my god . Sister amy : Hmm . You 're no doubt wondering How exactly our little organism survives . When michael decided to raise children Separately from their parents , He naturally encountered resistance , So he tried separating babies and mothers pre-birth . But how to keep the babies alive ? Well , he devised a neutral environment , A synthetic womb in which Babies could gestate without all those ... Troublesome emotional attachments . You people are insane . And your opinion is noted . Anyway , it didn 't work . They lived a few weeks , which isn 't bad , but ... Ultimately ... A dead end . ( sister amy chuckling ) You see , he could only use the jar For a baby that never grew , One frozen in its development , As if it were ... Immortal . Don 't ... Don 't . Don 't do that . Look , i don 't care about you Or your little tadpole . Tell me how you became an immortal . I was dying , And i received an infusion of spinal fluid From another immortal . Sounds dangerous . It can be , Especially if the fluid is from one of us . ( sighs ) When i was little , i used to watch my father standing here , Supervising his followers in the orchard . Even then ... I thought maybe one day i would take his place . And now i 'm here . But it 's not enough . I imagine there 's never enough for people like you . I want everything he had ... His world and his eternity . Make me immortal , And you will get your child back . So ... Do we have a deal ? Good . We 'll do it today . I can 't do a spinal sample myself . Alan can do it when he gets back . I 'm not waiting . Well , who do you expect to do the procedure ? You ? Why not me ? Because you 're not a doctor ! If you make a mistake , you could leave me paralyzed . Please , just let me talk to peter . Peter is off playing nursemaid to my poor mother . No . I want immortality today ! It 's latched from the inside ... No way to get through or Over unless you want to get lit up like a christmas tree . So , you 're telling me there 's no way in . Could try knocking . ( door opens ) Julia . Sergio . Don 't " sergio " me . Why haven 't you returned my messages ? It 's a long story . We don 't have time for this . I need to talk to somebody named michael . He 's gone missing . Then who 's in charge ? My name is anne . You arrive at a time of some change . But you are welcome . Whoever took out our guy is gonna try again , Pick us off one at a time . Keep your head on a swivel , Teams of two , no wandering off . Yes , ma 'am . Listen up ! Teams of two ! Fan out from here and sweep east ! ( sighs ) i 've seen this before , when we first arrived . Winger : Any idea what it means ? A trail marker , maybe ? Yeah , it 's a trail marker . You have a better theory ? Yeah , there are crazies out here saying , " go back wherever the hell you came from . " Can you two cut the chatter ? ( distant screaming ) Form up ! Form up ! Soldier : You heard the commander ! Form up ! Go ! Go ! Soren ? Jesus . Are you okay ? What happened to your eye ? I ... I 'm sorry , dr . Kyle . For what ? Are you aware of the ilaria corporation ? The name is unfamiliar to me . In four days , they 're going to launch a fatal virus , Which will decimate a large percentage of the human population ... Up to 5 billion deaths . Narvik ? A new strain , narvik-c . It 's self-replicating , So it 'll spread around the globe in a matter of weeks , If not days . I don 't see how we can help . Please don 't waste my time . I know about michael 's infertility experiments . I want the biotech . Why should i give it to you ? Ilaria 's unconcerned about how we slow population growth , Just that it happens . If i can show them another way ... Using our infertility graphs . Better that than slaughtering billions of people . This is an outside-world problem . It 's a whole-world problem . If they release the new narvik , No one is safe , not even on an island . I 'm asking for your help . There 's no need to lie . You 're not asking ... Your man ... Is prepared to shoot me if i refuse . Isn 't that right ? You don 't have it , do you ? It 's in a safe place . No . If you knew where it was , You 'd already be taking bids . I know anne , And i know this abbey . I can get you what you want . For a price ? What do you want , peter ? Guaranteed immunity from ilaria when all this is over . Done . And a finder 's fee , nine figures . You want $ 100 million ? To prevent 5 billion deaths , i 'd say you 're getting a bargain . You 're a pig . And pigs get fed . ( leaves rustling ) ( sighs ) There 's an indentation in between the third and fourth vertebrae . Got it . Angle the needle upward . Insert the needle half an inch Very slowly . I don 't know that i 'd let anyone do this to me Without anesthesia . I can 't tell you what to do If i 'm taking a nap . Ah ! Did i mention to do it slowly ? It 's not going in . The resistance is a membrane with fluid . Push a fraction of an inch . This part is crucial . Any further and you could damage my spinal cord . Nothing 's happening . Ah ! Take it out ! Take it out ! What 's going on ? You missed , ( gasps ) you 're in the nerve tissue . What should i do ? Take it out , damn it ! ( panting ) You 'll have to start over again . You know , this isn 't easy for me either . ( sighs ) ( insects chirping ) ( groaning ) ( tapping ) Good . You 're awake . So we get to see those pretty eyes . Where am i ? You 're a guest in our home . ( grunting ) see ? I even brought you supper . ( grunting with effort ) What we need on this island is salt . Did you bring any salt ? Sorry , fresh out . Try some . Ugh ! Smells great , but i 'm not hungry . I see . You 're too good to eat at my table . Got one of the good bits . ( retching ) The eyes are the best part . No , really , i couldn 't . Well , that 's it . I said i 'd look after you , But if you 're gonna badmouth my cooking ... ( grunting ) Cadmus : What do you think you 're doing ? I was just looking at his eyes . You stay away from him . Look at ya . You 're nowhere near ready ... Skinnier than one of them island rabbits . Ugh . ( insects buzzing ) Soldier : Nothing . Any sign of dr . Sommer ? The trail disappears up at the ridge . There 's no sign of anything within a quarter-mile radius . We 're going back to the abbey . No , no . We leave him out here , he 's dead . He 's probably dead already . Look , winger , We 're on the verge of finding a possible cure To maybe the world 's worst pathogen . I 'm not going back without it . The men assigned to my command Are not special forces or navy seal , But they 're men , And that guy hanging in the tree back there Is one of their own . Look , the only reason we were attacked Is because we 're getting closer . Now , i 'm sorry , but your man in the tree Can 't get any more dead than he is ! We keep searching . ( indistinct talking ) Jeez . That coulda left a mark . You 're still here ? Someone 's gotta knock some sense Into that thick head of yours . ( grunts ) Guess the big log didn 't do the trick . Do me a favor , if you have a point to make , Could you make it ? Don 't get all snippy on me . I 'm just wondering if you 've figured it out yet . I 'm afraid to ask . Then i 'll ask for you . What is it about this kyle fellow That 's got you so hot under the collar ? Nothing . I told you , i 'm trying to stop ilaria . Oh , ilaria this , ilaria that . You 're starting to sound like a broken record . What do you want from me , doreen ? The truth , for starters . You and i both know Saving a kid doesn 't amount to a hill o ' beans As far as ilaria 's concerned . If the shoe was on the other foot , He 'd be halfway back to seattle by now . No , he believes in what he 's doing . How 's that ? He 's young , he 's reckless , But he 's not going through the motions . He really believes it . Now we 're getting somewhere . Doreen , you know exactly Why i can 't leave kyle out here . Yeah , well , he 's as stubborn as you . And doesn 't back down from a fight . He may even look a bit like you If you shave the damn beard . Oh , and , uh , you may want to take care of that head wound . They bleed like a son of a bitch . What head wound ? Hey , you still here , doc ? ( sighs weakly ) I think so . Lucky you 're still in one piece . What happened ? Booby trap . We are getting close . Closer than you think . Thank god the mycotics are into juicy fruit . ( sighs ) It worked . I did it ! Now we transfer it to a clean syringe and ... When you 're ready , we reverse the procedure And inject it into your spine . What 's the matter ? I thought this is what you wanted . I 'm not sure i trust you . I trusted you . What choice did you have ? I just want my child back . I held up my end of the bargain . And i will hold up mine As soon as i know that you 're not gonna try anything . You want immortality , this is the only way . Maybe we could try it on a rabbit a test . It doesn 't work like that . I 'll do it . What ? Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm not . You can try it on me first . Why would you risk that ? She could be poisoning you . Then i 'll die . But i get to protect you , and ... If it works , Then i get to be immortal , too . We could be together forever . Fine . Try it on him first . That wasn 't part of the deal . It is now ! If you ever want to see your son again . ( grunting with effort ) ( jars clinking ) Hey , can i get a drink of water ? Look , i 'm sorry about the stew thing , But i 'm ... I 'm dying of thirst . Soren . I ... I 'm sorry , dr . Kyle . For what ? Tricking you into coming here . You didn 't really trick me . Plus , the big guy did the heavy work anyway . What you got there ? It 's from the bleeding tree . The bleeding tree ? Yeah . We eat it so we don 't get more sick . Soren , do you know what cadmus and carol do ? Y ... You know how they get their food , right ? Yeah , they trap people ... And eat them . That 's right . But i don 't want to be on the menu . If i help you , they 'll eat the rest of me . What do you mean , eat the rest of you ? Soren , listen . I promise i won 't let them hurt you anymore . You can 't . I can 't when i 'm tied up here . I need you to be brave . Please . No . No . Soren , please . That 's it . Cadmus : Hey ! What 's going on here ? How many days before you can give the procedure to amy ? Another three to four days Before i can donate any more spinal fluid . You hear that , amy ? I wish we could do it together right now . Me , too . But we 're going to be immortal together , so ... What 's a few more days ? What 's the holdup ? I 'm waiting for the anesthetic to kick in . Get it over with . Unless you have some reason not to . Okay , you might feel a slight amount of pressure . ( landry groaning ) I don 't ... I don 't feel any different . ( landry groaning ) ( landry grunting ) Amy : Ow ! Ah ! Help me ! Hold him down ! ( landry grunting ) what 's happening ? I don 't know . I 've heard of patients Who can reject a csf infusion . And i 've heard of doctors who poison their patients ! I didn 't do anything ! Yes , you did . You just said goodbye to your baby ! ( lock turning ) ( growling ) Balleseros : What 's wrong ? There are no seeds . Of course not . But we need seeds to plant trees . That 's the point of this whole mission . We don 't need seeds . We graft all our trees from the original root stalk . We call her " mother . " Her ? Michael discovered mother quite by accident When the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight . Only one tree survived , Absorbing the fungus Rather than being consumed by it . Later , michael discovered a curious effect in the fruit . It made the mortal men who ate it unable to father children . So all of this was created by accident ? Many of humanity 's greatest discoveries were accidental ... Penicillin , quinine , insulin . Why not mother ? I 'd like to see her . Of course . First you won 't eat my cooking ... Then you want to leave without saying goodbye ! Ah , yeah , where are my manners ? You 're a funny one . Lucky caddy didn 't catch you first . Sometimes ... He lets the rabbits run , Just so he can have a good chase . Says it tenderizes the meat . Only trouble is , when he catches ' em ... He gets the eyes all to himself . We will definitely be sharing yours . Blue is my favorite color ... Tastes great with honey . You eat the honey ? Course we do . Isn 't that dangerous ? Nah , i keep a jar of it all to me self . Don 't tell caddy . That 's ... That 's funny . He said the same thing about you . What 's that ? Ah , i probably shouldn 't say anything . Cadmus swore me to secrecy . He did , did he ? Cross my heart and hope to die . What 'd he say ? Don 't worry . You can trust me . I 'd like to , but ... You 've seen how cadmus gets When he 's angry . I can get angry , too ! You tell me , little rabbit . ( panting ) All right , all right , all right ! But you gotta promise not to say anything . It 's just ... He wants both my eyes for himself . Son of a bitch , i knew it ! Please , don 't tell him i told you . Some days i think i could kill him . That 's a good idea . Then you could eat his eyes . What do you think we are ? Savages ? We don 't eat our own . Why not ? Because it 's wrong . And the disease makes the meat rotten . Everyone knows that ! We 've taken extraordinary precautions Where mother is concerned . Nothing at the abbey is more important . ( gasps ) What 's wrong ? She 's gone . Mother is gone . Whew ! All right . Come on , you can do this . Come on ! Come on . Oh ! Come on . Kyle : ( groans ) no ... Oh , what 's this now ? Oh ! What happened to you ? I ... I can 't say . Oh , come on now , you can tell me . You tell me or i 'll give you something to bleed about . Who did that ? No , no . No , carol will get angry . Ah ... Carol . She knows better . She said she wanted ' em all to herself . What are you talking about ? My eyes ! She wanted to take my eyes , but i wouldn 't let her ! She did what ? She said she didn 't care what you thought . I told her you 'd get angry , but she didn 't care . That bitch ! Argh ! Never shoulda left her with fresh meat ! Where the hell are ya , woman ? What have i told you about ... ( voice trailing off ) Ah ! Cadmus : Quickly , woman ! The meat 's gone ! ♪ why do birds ♪ suddenly appear Cadmus : Gonna getcha ! ♪ every time ♪ you are near Cadmus : Run , rabbit ! Run ! ♪ just like me ♪ they long to be ♪ Cadmus : I see you , dead rabbit ! Carol : Share his eyes , caddy . Share ' em ! ♪ why do stars fall down from the sky ♪ every time ♪ you walk by ♪ just like me ♪ they long to be You 're gonna get it , rabbit . ♪ close to you ♪ on the day that you were born ♪ the angels got together ♪ and decided to create a dream come true ♪ so they sprinkled moon dust in your hair ♪ of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue ♪ that is why ♪ all the girls in town ♪ follow you ♪ all around ♪ just like me ♪ ( panting ) Ugh ! Hallo , rabbit . H ... Hold on , hold on now . Share his eyes , caddy . Share ' em . Enough , woman ! You 're cooked . Y 'all don 't eat your own . Carol told me . So what ? You 're clean . Not anymore . Ate all of it . Now i 'm sick , just like you . Ah ! ( cadmus sniffing ) You just ruined my meal . Yeah . I 'm real sorry about that . Oh , and you think you just saved yourself , do ya ? Naw . No . No ! ( gunfire ) Soldier : Clear ! Winger : Check the perimeter ! See if there are any more of them ! No more mycotics . Just the boy , soren . You hurt ? I 'm all right . For two more days , at least . What are you talking about ? We 'd better find that damned tree , Or i 'm a dead man . ( slow song playing )

 We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabitable , But they were wrong , and we 've been fighting For our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , But most of us are still here , Searching for other survivors from the ark , Trying to build something real and lasting Out of the wilderness--a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , We need to make peace with the grounders , But peace is a foreign concept here . I 'm not going in . Clarke- - It 's just gonna remind me Of what i did to get them here . May we meet again . The grounders out there will attack this camp . If we wait , we die . 10 men with automatic rifles is all it would take . You 're asking me to get you the guns . Get out of the way , grounder . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? What you didn 't have the guts to . Pike for chancellor ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Congratulations , mr . Chancellor . Let 's finish what we started . Thinking about home ? Thinking about whether arkadia is home . When i left , it had a different name . I was different . You left a hero to your people , And you return one . The mountain slayer returns with the body Of the ice queen . You bring them justice . You bring them justice . We bring them peace . Hey , here they are . My god , look at them . What happened to them ? Look at that . They 're in bad shape . Pretty hurt . What happened ? Bellamy , you ok ? I 'm fine . What happened out there ? What 's going on ? The chancellor said ... Lock it up . All right . Seal it up . Everybody listen up . Hey , hey , hey . 24 hours ago , you elected me your chancellor . Every action i 've taken since and every action i will take Will be to achieve one sacred goal- - The creation of a self-sustaining , prosperous , And safe arkadia . All right ! Yeah . This morning on a muddy field , Our people paid tribute to those who have been taken from us By sending a message to the grounders . This land is ours now . Resist , and you will be met by force . Fight , and you will be greeted by death . Today is a new beginning . Mark it down . Remember it just like the grounders will remember it . Chancellor pike , you tell them , pike . No wounded . 10 against 300 , and there 's no wounded . How 's that possible ? Heda ! All bullet wounds . Heda ... Indra . Heda . Nngh ! Ok . Aah ! Nngh ! I need bandages . Stay away . You 're one of them . Indra ... Nngh ! Indra , what happened here ? They attacked while we slept . Our watch was to the north looking for azgeda . They killed our archers first . Our infantry couldn 't get close . Then they executed the wounded . The summit was two days ago . How could kane do this ? It wasn 't kane . It was pike . How did you escape ? Bellamy . Bellamy was with them ? He wanted to spare the wounded , But they wouldn 't listen . He convinced pike to let me live So i could deliver a message . What message ? Skaikru rejects the coalition . This is their land now . We can leave , or we can die . Send riders . I call upon the armies of the twelve clans . In a day 's time , we lay waste to arkadia And everyone within its walls . Sha , heda . Mount up . Wait . Give me time to fix this . What are you doing ? I can 't let you leave , clarke . So i 'm a prisoner now , just like that ? Yes . Lexa , let me go to arkadia . No . At least let me talk to kane . We can bring him here . Indra , at the summit , kane told me He gave you a radio , a way to signal him . Do it , please . Is it true you tried to leave camp To see indra yesterday ? Look . Don 't you have more important things To worry about than me sneaking out of camp ? As it turns out , That 's why you 're here . Indra signaled . She wants to meet . I 'd go myself , but pike 's watching Everything i do now . You want me to go see indra ? I need you to . I 'm in , but how do i get out ? The gate is armed with- - Crawl space door in 20 feet Drops you outside the camp wall . Get out there . You find out what the hell happened . Then you report back here . Can you do that ? I was born for this . Marcus kane , report to the chancellor 's office . Marcus kane to the chancellor 's office . Our goal is secure access to water and arable land With defensible terrain on as many sides of us as possible . A 15-kilometer perimeter around arkadia Should be sufficient . 15 kilometers ? Sir , there 's a grounder village . Which will , no doubt , be the staging area For a retaliatory attack . Clearing it will be our first order of business . What 's the location of the village ? Clear the village ? Give us the room . Yes , sir . Kane and lincoln are waiting outside . Thought you might like this back . Do you have something to say to me ? We went too far . I know it seems harsh , But we don 't leave survivors . We don 't have the medical supplies To treat their people , and we can 't risk them Coming back to kill us . You know , we 've all learned pretty quickly That war causes us to do things That we 'll spend the rest Of our lives trying to forget . The only advice i can give you Is to think about the lives we saved today , Not the ones that were lost . Can you do that ? Yes , sir . He 's ready for you . What the hell happened out there ? We did what we had to do . Wake up . You attacked an army that was there to help us . You murdered innocent people . Is that who you are now ? You thought you couldn 't live with yourself After mount weather . Well , you just started a war That 'll kill us all . You need to wake up , and don 't tell me The difference between azgeda and trikru . Trikru killed 37 of my friends Before you even touched the ground . We didn 't start anything . They did . They ? You know what i meant . I used to . Danae 's still getting worse . Antibiotics every two hours . Keep me updated . What the hell , abby ? Raven , calm down . I know that you 're upset . Upset ? I just showed up for work and found out you fired me . I don 't fire people . Not clearing me medically is the same damn thing . Come on . Let 's go sit down . No . I don 't need to sit down . My leg is fine . No , it 's not , And riding a patrol and working that wall Are making your conditions worse . So what , Do nothing ? That 's gonna make my leg heal ? No . Your leg is never gonna heal . Our goal is pain reduction- - That 's it--and if you keep pushing this hard , Even that 's not gonna happen . You can still be useful . They 've been busy . Welcome home , thelonious . Let 's begin . Otan , stay close . Open up ! I didn 't see that coming . I want people on that gate . Chancellor jaha ? Sir , it 's good to see you . Shawn gillmer ? Farm station made it ? Not enough of us , sir . Hands where i can see them . It 's ok . He 's with me . Sorry , sir . No grounders through the gates , Chancellor 's orders . I said , he 's with me . Tell him to hand over the pack Right now . Hey , stop it . No ! Otan ! Agh ! Come on . We 're taking him . Otan ! Hold your fire . Medic ! We need a medic ! This belongs to me . He was going for my gun . You 'll be all right , otan . Go to the city of light . Alie will be waiting for you on the other side . Right over here . Hurry . Thelonious ? He 's gone . I 'm sorry . Don 't be . Death is not the end . It 's good to see you , abby . You there . Took you long enough . Uh ! What did he say ? He said you 're cute for a thief . Yeah . Well , too bad he 's not really my type . Let 's get out of here . Oh , don 't worry about john murphy . That boy 's a fighter . And the others ? You left with 12 people thelonious . Kane . Ah , welcome home , my friend . Where 's your uniform ? Pike just relieved me of my command , Stripped lincoln of his commission . Heh . You always did have good timing . Abby caught me up . I 'm sorry about the election , marcus . Forget the election . The war you predicted the day you left Is about to happen . Ask him where he 's been . I found the city of light . Well , that 's great ... Isn 't it ? Ask his friend otan . Apparently , he 's there right now . I don 't blame you for doubting , abby . I know how it sounds , But it is real , and it is incredible . Everything that you worry about now- - War , power- - None of it matters in the city of light . I heard you were here , sir . And i heard you made it , hannah . I was so glad . Chancellor pike would like to speak with you . We 'll finish this later . Right this way , sir . The chancellor is waiting . You look good for a man who 's been In the wilderness for 4 months . So do you . I heard you had it pretty rough . We gave worse than we got . I heard that , too . You don 't approve ? I don 't judge . Since when ? I 'm not the same man that i was on the ark , charles . None of us is . I was a teacher . Now i 'm chancellor . I am wondering , though , What do you know ? He 's threatened by you . I 'm just a man who wants to save his people , No threat to you . Save us ? Forgive me for being blunt , thelonious , But i need to ask why you 've returned . I just told you- - To save my people . Do you want him to think you 're a fool ? You actually believe that ? Yes . I do . Ok . I 'm game . How , exactly , are you gonna do that ? By freeing the minds from the bonds Of physical and spiritual pain . I am here To show the people of arkadia the way . You 've lost him . Have some faith . Tell you what . As long as you stay out of my way , You can save whoever wants saving . Lord knows there 's enough pain here To go around . Thank you , chancellor . Oh ... The bleeding 's stopped . We need to get you something for the pain . Uh ... Octavia ? Where 's kane ? He sent me . Indra . Thank god . How did this happen ? Kane lost the election to pike . Everything 's different . Your people voted for this ? No . No . I don 't believe that . What do you know , clarke ? You haven 't been here . Listen to me . The grounder army is gonna be here in less than a day . I need to see bellamy . Bellamy was a part of this . He 's with pike . What makes you think he 'll help us ? He saved indra 's life . If what octavia 's saying is true , Then pike trusts him . If i can get to him , he can get to pike . You can 't just walk through the gates , clarke . You 've been living with their enemy . If it were me , i 'd kill you on the spot . I can get her in . So where you want to head next- - The north , south ? We 've been on a heck of a roll . I want to go after my brother . We 've talked about this . Otan 's with jaha at camp . Why would you want to go there ? He 's my brother . If there 's a chance , I have to try and get him back . Going after otan 's not a good move . John- - it 's not a survivor 's move . Then wait for me . I 'll come back . In this world , when people leave , They don 't come back . I did . Not for me . I just so happened to be there . John , come with me . I 'm not that stupid . Reveille . On your feet . Line up now . Go . What are you doing ? These are sick people . You can 't just throw them out into the cold . We 're not . They 're being interned . What ? Out of my way . Stand up . Come on . Lincoln , you don 't want to be here right now . Oh . We asked them to come here . We can 't spare the supplies . Danae . Lincoln , no . Uh ... She is too sick to move . Uh ... Looks like she 's moving just fine to me . Gillmer , back off . Jackson , why did you bring him here ? Uhh ! Uh ! Uh ! Rrgh ! Rrgh ! Lincoln- - uh ! Lincoln . Lincoln ! He goes with them . Take him . Move . Sorry we had to do this the hard way . We all have pain . Some of it is physical from injuries or age . Some is mental , you know , Living with the loss of our loved ones . If you think about it , whether we fight that pain Or succumb to it , the result is the same . It diminishes our lives , Robs us of our passions and pastimes And damages relationships between friends and lovers . What if i told you that there 's A simple way to eliminate that pain ? I 'd say you 're full of crap . There 's no simple way to eliminate pain , And you know it . So much suffering . If we get her , the others will come . This can make it go away . Heh . Please . The key to the city of light , To your salvation and relief . Ok . Ok . You 're telling these people what , That they swallow that , and they 'll be living In happy town for the rest of their lives ? You should be ashamed of yourself . We need her . She 's not ready . I 'll be here when you are . Kindly move forward . Straight ahead . Move . Pick up your feet . Come on . Lincoln . Lincoln . I 'm ok . Don 't fight this . He 's right . Lincoln , what the hell is going on ? We 're interning the grounders . Lincoln 's here because of a disturbance in sick bay . Last one . Let 's go . What 's happening to you ? Octavia- - I saw what you and pike did to lexa 's army . Bellamy , you killed everyone . Keep your voice down . What 's wrong ? You 're not proud of massacring an army That was here to help us ? We 're not doing this here . Good . Then let 's go because i 'm not even close to done . You need to be careful , o . If you keep this up , i won 't be able to protect you . Thanks for the warning . I 'm serious . Look at yourself . It is time to stop playing grounder Before you get yourself hurt . I 'm not playing anything . This is who i am . You 're my brother . I shouldn 't have to tell you that . Now i 'm done . Go easy on octavia . I had to beg her to get me into camp . What are you doing here , clarke ? We need to talk . Oh , you 've decided that , The mighty wanheda Who chose the grounders over her own people , Who turned her back on us when we came to rescue you . Now you want to talk . I came here to tell you that the ice nation Has paid a price . Justice has been served For the attack on mount weather . I came here to tell you it 's over . There it is again . Why do you get to decide it 's over ? We did our part . We ? Lexa and i . The ice queen is dead . The problem was solved , and then you Let pike ruin everything . Why are you here , clarke ? Arkadia needs to make things right , Or lexa and the twelve clans will wipe us out . Let her try . Please tell me That going to war is not what you want . We 've been at war since we landed . At least pike understands that . Pike is the problem . This isn 't who you are . You 're wrong . This is who i 've always been , And i let you and octavia and kane convince me That we could trust these people When they have shown over and over who they are , And i won 't let anyone else die for that mistake . Bellamy ... I need you , And we don 't have much time . You need me ? Yes . I do . I need the guy who wouldn 't let me Pull that lever in mount weather by myself . You left me . You left everyone . Bellamy- - enough , clarke . You are not in charge here , and that 's a good thing Because people die when you 're in charge . You were willing to let a bomb drop on my sister . Then you made a deal with lexa , Who left us in mount weather to die And forced us to kill everyone who helped us , People who trusted me . I- - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for leaving . I knew i could because they had you . I know we can fix this . I 'm sorry , too . Hey . No . Don 't . No . Bellamy , don 't . God- - Oh ... Zero-g mechanic sorting scrap metal out for ammo , huh ? Was this abby 's idea ? Is it supposed to make you feel better ? I can help you , raven . Don 't , all right ? Everyone thinks they have an idea On how to help me feel better- - Stay in camp , Only do dbs where i can sit down , Ask every time i need something On a high shelf- - but you know what ? I 'm not that person . People think i can just change And my pain will go away , but i can 't . I can 't do that , and i can 't do this . What have you got to lose ? Pike should be in his quarters . Bellamy , you don 't have to do this . Yes , i do . Just let me go . Believe it or not , I am doing this for your own good . Believe it or not , i 'm doing this for yours . You can 't just hit a guard . I just did . Let her go . I can 't do that . They 're coming . You should go . Uh ... Uh ! Clarke , hurry up . Get them on deck two . Let 's go . Follow me . Come on . Mom . We know what happened . We know what pike did . Is there anything we can do to prevent a retaliation ? Abby , hurry . We came here to give them pike . He 's the duly elected chancellor . Our people knew what they were voting for . Besides , he has the guards and all the guns . Can 't get close to him . And that 's not the way we do things . Then maybe it 's time we change The way we do things . Security breach . Lock down the exits . You two need to go now . What about lincoln ? You want to help him , do it from the outside with this . The range isn 't great . You stay close and wait for me to contact you . Now go . Come with me . I wish i could . May we meet again . I do a much better job of making you look dead . Your brother- - It can wait until i can convince you To join me , which i will . Perfect timing . We know you 're not alone . Where 's the girl ? She left . Find her . On your knees . You 've been caught stealing in the commander 's woods . The punishment for this is death . I 'll ask you once more- - where 's the girl ? Go float yourself . Where did you get this ? I guess if you kill me now , you 'll never find out . On your feet . Move . Keep walking . Careful . This one doesn 't like to be chained up . Girlfriend 's not here to free you this time . It 's from abby for danae . Octavia ? She got out with clarke . Heda ... Where 's octavia ? She 's watching over camp . So tell us , clarke , how does this end ? Have you come up with a way to save your people yet again ? No . Only you can do that . What happened here was an act of war . Your army was here to help us , And my people slaughtered them . You have every right to respond , Every right to wipe us out , Or you can change the way you do things . Why should she change ? Blood must have blood . Really ? Because from where i stand , The only way that ends is with everyone dead . So what kind of leader do you want to be , The kind who kills every chance she gets Because that 's your way Or the kind who shows the world a better way . You consider letting a massacre Go unavenged a better way ? If it ends a cycle of violence , yes . If it brings about peace , yes . Someone has to take the first step . Let it be you . You say you want peace . Everything you 've done was to achieve that , Yet here we stand on the brink Of another war , a war you could stop . Commander , You can 't seriously be considering this . I 'm not considering it . I 'm doing it . Heda , please . Indra , our people Act as if war is easier than peace . If that 's so , should we not try and achieve The more difficult goal ? Polis will not support you . Titus- - Titus is my subject . They 're all my subjects . Do you say they will defy me ? Will you defy me ? No , heda . I will not . Then let it be known . Blood must not have blood . For more new Episodes go to DayT.se

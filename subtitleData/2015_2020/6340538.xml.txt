 Previously on Defiance ... I made a deal with a devil to save my father . This devil was a machine , a ship bent on destroying the world . It had big plans for me . It made me destroy New York City and hurt the people I love . What happened ? Did Irisa kill Tommy ? Yes . You remember Pilar , Rafe 's wife . You 're not still sick ? Never been better . Alak ! And if you struggle , you 'll hurt the baby . Pilar has kidnapped Alak and christie . Do you know how many people I have killed ? Do you know how many people you can still save ? To save the planet , we had to travel into the heart of darkness , the ship buried deep under the town of Defiance . He did it . Looks like we just saved the world . That 's it . All right . I love you , baby girl . Any word on Nolan ? He disappeared . Old St. Louis is gone . If Nolan was in the collapse , I 'm afraid he 's gone as well . Madam Mayor , the stasis nets just went dark . I ordered them to pull the plug . Gulanite reserves are down to 3 % . City charter stipulates that all power be diverted to heating and medical services . And they 're still asking for you at the NeedWant . Of course . With the stasis nets down , the town is a sitting duck for raiders or whatever else comes through Bissel pass . You think I don 't know that ? People are scared . Yeah , well , I 'm scared too . Don 't tell anybody that . Better be an emergency , Lambert . I 've got a town to run . But it 's doc Yewll . She 's up 30k . Yewll ? She 's not a gambler . What 's she up to ? I don 't know , but if she keeps going , you know , she 's gonna clean us out . Doc Yewll . You don 't normally gamble in my establishment . Just cutting loose . Getting my ya-ya 's out . Winning big , I see . Yeah . You angling for a tip ? Here you go , legs . - Now scoot . - Everybody stay calm ! - Nobody move . Hand over your cash , scrip chips , and jewelry . Don 't you move . Everyone does as they 're told , and everyone walks away . - Empty your pockets . - Don 't even think about it . Empty ' em ! Turn around ! Move it ! Ah ! I don 't think so ! Get that safe open ! Friend , I don 't run this place anymore . You 're still the owner ! But I don 't know the combination . Next shot goes through someone 's skull . Okay . Let me guess . You 're an out-of-work miner . Hap , is that you under that mask ? Just get the scrip ! Things feel pretty desperate around here , don 't they ? Mines collapsed . Pow farms covered under a ton of snow . Construction jobs nonexistent . But this ? This is not the answer . Shut up , and give me the Jekking cash ! Berlin , look out ! Ahh ! Ahh ! You okay ? It 's been a day . Hey . Where 's my daughter ? Hey ! Ugh ! Irisa ! Kiddo , hey , hey . Hey , kiddo . Hey , you okay ? You okay ? Your breath stinks . Oh , you 're all right . All right . Oh , oh . Come on . How 'd we get here ? Where are we ? Thank Christ . Any movement ? No . No patrols . Good . Come quickly then . We spotted them . Bundle up , dear . It 's a walk . It 's an old joint Pilar 's parents had when she was little . Only my wife would be crazy enough to hole up behind enemy lines . Our grandchild . Have you seen Alak and christie ? Not yet . They 're probably inside . If your wife has harmed them , she will die an excruciating death . And if she hasn 't harmed them ? Same outcome . I see your point . How do we get down there ? Well , the incline 's too steep . We 've got to go around the long way . Come on . Let 's get back to the roller . Nothing like the cold air to ward off croup . Does he need to be changed ? Yeah , but don 't worry , honey . Grandma 's got little lukey . Votanis collective death squad . They 've taken our vehicle . Ah , Chup . We can 't let them discover the children . All right . Make it look good . - Move . - Take it easy ! Loyal to the collective ? I shall be the judge of that . I am General Rahm Tak . The beast . You 've heard of me ? I , however , find myself at a disadvantage . I am Datak Tarr of the Shanje Liro . Ah . I know the name . You 're from Defiance . A self-styled crime lord , are you not ? I 've learned to make some small profit among the humans . Small indeed . Your donations to our common cause have been meager , at best , and you 're only Shanje by marriage . Who 's the pink skin ? Who you calling pink skin , you Edgar winter piece of sht ... McCawley . The name is Rafe McCawley . Please don 't kill him . The human is our bounty . There is a price on his head back in Defiance . You are in luck . My caravan is headed to your hometown . We 'll make camp here . We can travel together , once we 've eaten and rested . I won 't take " no " for an answer . I 've been dying for some cultured company . General Tak , may I ask what business you have in Defiance ? You may , indeed . I 'm going to kill all the humans and burn the disgusting place to the ground . Okay , you don 't have to do that . - It 's all there . - I count by twos . It goes fast . She 's gonna need it to pay her way across the badlands . What are you talking about ? What 's with the packed bags ? Excuse me . I 've got a ticket on tomorrow 's land coach . Thought I 'd try my luck out West . This town needs you . What this town needs is a sensitively worded obituary . Defiance has faced harder winters than this . It 's time to get real . It 's been seven months since the McCawley mines collapsed . Gulanite was the lifeblood of this town . There is no future without it . Oh , and incidentally , I just heard that the stasis nets went down . Amanda , is that true ? It 's temporary . Ah , so we 're only temporarily screwed . - Good news . - Ow . I depart with a clear conscience . Look , we 've lost soldiers , doctors , engineers , anyone with a skill marketable to the outside world , but you know who stayed ? The people who can 't leave . The people who can 't survive in the badlands . Yeah , and they 're depending on people like us to keep it all together . Come on , doc . You 're the only doctor in town . If you leave , people will die . I don 't want that on my conscience , and I don 't think you do either . The fact that you try to appeal to my better angels is adorably human . So you 're staying ? Get your skinny ass out of here . I 've got work to do . Last thing I remember , uh , was the ceiling coming down on us . You were in my arms , and ... I pulled you into one of those life pods , and it closed up around . We must have gone to sleep . I wake up , and we 're being pulled out by something . Some alien I 've never seen before . Older male . Younger female . Purple skin . Real strong . This ringing a bell for you ? They cut you ? Yeah , must have . You got one too . Defiance is that way . We should probably go soon . I can 't go back . They 're gonna lynch me . It 's the only town . They know I 'm a mass murderer . I destroyed New York . Nolan , I killed Tommy . All right . Now , you listen up because I 'm only gonna say this once . It was that arkbrain that did the killing , not you . You are as much a victim as anyone . You fought it . You beat it , and you saved everyone . I could not be prouder of you . They 're still gonna lynch me . Details , details . What is that ? It 's a wormhole flare . Long-distance coded message . Votanis collective . The V.C. isn 't normally this far north . I wonder who they 're talking to . What 's the message ? It 's good . Just got word from Defiance , the stasis nets are down . Datak . Stahma . Exciting news from my spies outside of Defiance . The Gulanite shortage has apparently forced the town to pull the plug on the stasis nets . Cause for celebration , no ? You 'll overrun them easily . And that pleases you ? Of course , Favi Tak . General Rahm Tak . I know I 'm not supposed to take this job personally , but I must admit , I 'm going to enjoy this campaign . I mean , the very idea of Defiance turns my stomach . I don 't know how you two lived there . You know , I think I will hook a cable to that arch and pull the whole thing to the ground . Perhaps they 'll put a statue of me in its place . That is a beautiful dream . Was that sarcasm ? Because I assure you , Favi Tarr , my aspirations are achievable . I am not a delusional man . There 's our signaler . The one holding the wormhole flare gun . I 've seen him in Defiance . They don 't look like soldiers . Why are they signaling the V.C. ? That 's because they 're spies . Go around to the right . That one 's yours . I 'll get the one by the truck . Don 't move . I said don 't move . You 're from Defiance . They wrote that book about you . What book ? Drop the gun ! No . No shooting . No shooting . We 're friends . I speak English , see ? Oh , look . You 're trembling . Ah ! Irisa . Hey ! Come on . What happened ? My weapon jammed . Let me . I 've had three children , you know . You have to keep one of them chained to the table , so she won 't run away on you . Oh , I bet you spent all night thinking up that one . Check the traps , funny boy . Getting cold out there . I 'll go . I need to stretch my legs . Come on . Where would I run to ? We 're in the middle of nowhere . I know you want to kill me . Mom ! Excuse me ? And I don 't blame you . I know how mad both of you are . But you don 't care ? Oh , don 't say that . I care very much . And yet here we are . Your parents are terrible people . They threatened me . They told me they would kill me if I stayed in Defiance . Listen , when they tell ... I could not abandon my family a second time . Therefore , I had no choice but to bring you with me . Surely , you understand that as a father . Shh . - Sure . - Sweetheart , hush . Then it 's settled . We 'll both go . Unchain him . Looks like E-Rep pulled up stakes . - Good . - Don 't be so sure . Earth Republic was the only thing keeping the V.C. Out of north America . Come on . Last time we saw Amanda , she tried to shoot me . She considered shooting you . I remind you she didn 't actually pull the trigger . But , yeah . Yeah , you stay in the car . Sure you can spare the bullets ? Where 's Pottinger ? He 's gone . - I 'm back in charge . - What 'd you do ? Stuff the ballot box ? This town 's on its last legs . I 've been hanging on by my fingernails . Where the hell were you ? Trapped under a mile of solid rock . How long have we been gone ? Seven months . Is Irisa ... Downstairs ? Yeah . Excuse me ? I knew it was you . Irisa . Can you sign this ? It 's for my boyfriend . What 's it feel like saving the world ? Bet it feels great , huh ? What happened to your head ? Ah ! Stasis nets are down . What the hell is going on with that ? - Can 't spare the Gulanite . - Well , you 're gonna have to . You got to get them up , and you got to get them up now . - You don 't understand . - No . You don 't understand . - Votanis collective . - Mm-hmm . They 're coming for you . This book 's trash . I won 't sign this . Take a walk , poole . But don 't you know who this is ? - Go home , deputy . - No , my shift doesn 't end for ... Go home ! I 'm the Lawkeeper now . These are all the weapons that are left in the armory ? There was looting when the E-Rep bugged out . All right , I guess it 's gonna have to do for a start . The real issue is power . We don 't get those stasis nets back up and running , this war is over before it begins . - Come on . - Where we going ? To the Gulanite mines . - There 's no point . - Why not ? The mines collapsed the night you disappeared . The ground hardened into I don 't know what , but our drills can 't cut through . Gulanite 's down there , but we can 't access it . And yet somehow Irisa and I found our way out and made it to the surface , so there 's got to be a tunnel or something . You don 't know how you made it to the surface ? No , but the purple-skins do . Purple-skins ? I 'll tell you on the way . Hey ! Berlin ! Berlin , what the hell are you doing ? - She killed Tommy ! - A machine killed Tommy ! You lay a hand on her again , and I don 't care who you are , I will put you in the ground . That hardware always been there ? No . It 's new . Thought you said no one was home at the mines . I did . Looks like someone set up shop for themselves . This tech 's Votan . Indogene . Looks like our squatters are from your neck of the woods , kiddo . I 'm from Denver . Oh , baby . Come to papa . Purples took my gun , so we know we 're in the right place . They have terraformers . What the hell was that ? I 'm not waiting to find out . Ah ! Strong pulse . She 's just stunned . Come on . On me . You cover right . Rahm Tak ... - Is there something wrong ? - No talking . Come . Quickly . We found some humans . Should be educational . Well , somebody 's been busy down here . What the hell do they want with all this Gulanite ? I want to get my hands on one of those drones . Figure out how they work , we might get a bead on who or what we 're dealing with here . Whoa . I remember you . You want to tell us what you 're doing in our mines ? Oh , feeling frisky , are we ? Drop the weapon ! Drop it ! You guys okay ? Yeah . Did you have to shoot her in the gut ? - I was aiming for the legs . - Nice aim . Look , I 'm a little shaky after being zapped by that thing . Is she gonna live ? Not unless we get her to a doctor fast . Grab the roller . It 's V.C. patrol . I 'm gonna go talk to them . Then unlock the chain first . Mom wouldn 't like that . Luke is half Casti , half human . Do you know what the Votanis collective does to mixed-breed babies ? Find a good hiding place . Yeah , yeah . Boring , boring . Do you know who I am ? Rahm Tak . I 'm on your side . I worked as a spy for the collective . I assassinated Earth Republic ambassador Tennety . What did you say your name was ? Quentin McCawley . McCawley . McCawley , McCawley , McCawley , McCawley , McCawley , McCawley . Never heard of you . Ah ! No ! Oops . Was that your son ? - No ! - McCawl ... He just did it out of spite . I 'm sorry , Rafe . As family , we will bear this zoruto and take vengeance together . Thanks , Datak . It means a lot . Someone 's coming . The General 's asking for you two . Stahma , you said you captured " papa bear " McCawley somewhere around here , right ? Yes . And yet you failed to notice that he had a son running around loose ? We 're as surprised as you must be . Clever humans . I 'm beginning to think you 're the clever one , Stahma . Ah ! Look at this . I found a mouse . This is a private home . You have no right to be here ! So ? The baby . We need to get the soldiers out of here . No ! Oh , dad ! She 's ... she 's in shock . I am not in shock ! I know exactly what I 'm saying ! May your Liro stink of unclean death in the forever-after of the three hells ! Oh , forgive her . Please ! Stahma , did you teach this human the curses of our people ? This is your husband 's charge blade . I want you to kill this human with it . Do it for me . I sense hesitation . Would you kill this human in exchange for your husband 's life ? Stahma , make a decision . - Stahma ! - Come . Make a decision ! I 'm not afraid . Aah ! No ! Oh ! Shh ! Thank you , General , for providing clarity . Of course , the only good human is a dead one . Favi Tak , may we leave this place now ? The human death-stink offends . Of course . Move out !

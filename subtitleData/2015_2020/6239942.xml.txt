 ( Irisa ) Previously on Defiance ... You had him , Rahm Tak , the leader of the Votanis Collective . And if you hadn 't have choked , he 'd be a cooling corpse right now and Defiance would be a whole lot safer . We 're at war , kiddo , and you 've become an unreliable partner . Rahm Tak is ready to make his move . I saw him buy a truckload of weapons from an arms dealer . The weapons had the Von Bach Industries logo on them . When Alak was describing the arms dealer , you had a reaction . Alak is clearly describing my ex-boyfriend Conrad Von Bach . My mom and dad , they 're working as spies for the V.C. [ grunting ] Go ! Go ! Datak spotted us . He 's gonna run . Grab him now . [ Datak speaking native language ] I think one of us is going to die . [ grunting ] I 've been stabbed . I need your help . I am at a loss for words . I know how much you and your wife hate me . Believe me , the feeling 's more than mutual . But despite it all , I really did think you loved our town . Maybe even as much as I do . I truly believed that , when faced with a common enemy , an enemy that wants to destroy our town and everything it stands for , that you would stand with us . I would never say you are a good man , but siding with a mass murderer ? I thought you were better than that . It is with a heavy heart that I vote to convict . [ marble clinks in cup ] [ clink ] [ clink ] [ clink ] [ clink ] [ clink ] [ clink ] [ whistles ] [ clink ] Datak Tarr , this panel has found you guilty of high treason , which carries a sentence of death by hanging . If you wish , you may now make a brief statement . Did my wife do that to your face ? It 's a good look for you . [ scoffs ] [ rock music ] ♪ ♪ Nice town , Benedict . Think I should buy it ? I think you should buy an airplane . You 're a hopeless romantic . Watch the truck . Okay . Thanks , Augusta . No , these aren 't really me either , are they ? Um , how about the blue frames ? What 's with the sign ? My husband and I are moving west . It 's not safe in Defiance . Not safe ? They say soldiers are coming to kill humans . Most of my friends have left town already . Well , you 're smart to get out . I 'm heading west myself after I conclude a bit of business . If you 're ever in AngelArc , look me up . - You 're a Von Bach ? - Yeah . Really ? It 's been a long time , Conrad . Jess . Been a while . You look good . I have two questions for you . One , did you sell weapons to the Votanis Collective ? Guilty as charged . But you understand , this is ... Oh . You had another question ? Did you bring weapons for us ? You never were much into foreplay . [ dramatic music ] Snapdragon bolt-rifles , cold-fire hand cannons ... Particle Overmag . Beautiful weapon . I 'll say . See ? It 's what Von Bach Industries are all about . Providing quality weapons for people to defend themselves . And here I thought you were a family of ruthless war profiteers who cared about nothing but the bottom line . The Butcher of Yosemite is calling me ruthless ? Ouch . You supplied arms to the V.C. Aw , come on . We 're businessmen . We don 't discriminate . We don 't take sides . We sell weapons to those who can afford them . Nolan . You 've put a lot of innocent lives at risk . You choose your next words carefully . Aloe Vera . [ weapon whirs ] Voice-matching activation . I say when my guns work . I say when they don 't . Don 't worry , we 'll match it to your voice once we 've settled on a price . Stop showing off . What 's the number ? Still no foreplay . I 'm telling you , Jess , you 're missing out . All right , It 's a zero. is . Consider the weapons a gift . A gift . Are you joking ? Von Bachs never joke when it comes to business . That 's what makes us so boring . What 's the catch ? The catch is , you buy me a drink . How 's that sound ? Do it . Drinks are on the house . Anything for the team . Goldenrod . [ weapon whirs ] They 've got about as far as they can with the shovels . We 're about to bring in the drill . Good . I suppose there 's no point in putting this off any longer . [ grunts ] This is going to hurt , Bebe . Purity requires sacrifice . [ groaning ] Hey , kiddo . Nice job on those flyers . Don 't make fun of me . What ? " Nice work on those flyers " ? Don 't you think I want to pick up a gun and defend the town like everybody else ? I wasn 't making fun . Right . So I 'm just hypersensitive . Is that what you 're saying ? No ! No . Whatever . I 'll make copies . Almost done . You were in town today . Any news of my husband ? He 's been sentenced to die . When ? In three days . [ sighs ] I 'm sure you 'd like some time alone with your thoughts . You can rest in my quarters while I 'm in the mines . I 've caused so much trouble , yet you show me nothing but kindness . Wake me when you return . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Forgive my daughter . She 's prone to tantrums . There is nothing to forgive . _ _ Speak English . You need the practice . This town will turn on us if they learn you 're protecting a spy . I have no intent in telling them . Do you ? ( Berlin ) So how 's your nose ? It hurts . Thank you for the guns . You 're welcome for the guns . How much trouble are you in ? Oh , well , very soon expect to make the transition from black sheep of the family to disinherited dead black sheep of the family . So why did you do it ? Well , it was the only gesture I could think of big enough to impress you . No , no , no . Connie , you and me are ancient history . - You and I. - Don 't correct my grammar . You know I hate that . Yeah , I know . I know . So did I ? - Did you what ? - Impress you . I 've missed you . You say that , but I 'm not sure you do . I came home from the tour , and our Redwood apartment was empty . Furniture gone . You took the dog . And your mother 's lawyer was there with a briefcase full of scri . Told me that you had reconsidered the wisdom of our relationship . What . I never said that . Come on . I never said that . I was under the impression that you dumped me . What ? Yeah . Mother told me she offered you cash to break off the engagement and you accepted . She said that proved you were only after our family money . No , no , no , no , no . What really happened was , I shot a hole in the briefcase , and then I shot your mother 's lawyer in the foot . - Is that the truth ? - Yeah . It felt great . Well , looks like Mother outsmarted us both . No one ever called her stupid . I 'm so sorry . I ... I just wish ... I wish you 'd come ... told me the truth . Pretty sure you have that backwards . [ sighs ] So you 're happy here in Defiance ? When the E-Rep was here , I felt safe . There was this guy Tommy , and he was gentle and kind and had a great ass . Okay , so now I 'm jealous . Don 't be . He 's dead . You want to go upstairs ? Yeah , I do . [ grunting ] [ grunts ] - You 're late . - Long night . I bet . Well , decent turn-out . It 'll do , for a start . Okay , recruits ! Fall in . [ sighs ] Here you go . No , thanks . I brought my own . Come on , that 's an antique . Weather vane . [ gunshots ] She gets the job done . I guess so . What 's your name ? Ranikar , but you can call me Zera . All right , Zero , you can shoot . Who taught you ? My dad . I built him that gun myself from scrap parts and old metal . Took me three months to get the scope right . I 'm Indur , by the way . Good to have you here . Thank you . So this is it ? This is all you got ? We 're in the process of building . Bebe ! _ _ _ _ That 's it , come on . - Pick those legs up . - Four ! - Let 's go . That 's better . - Five ! - All right , good . - Six ! - Seven ! - Let 's go , people . - Eight ! - What are you doing ? - Where 's your daughter ? - Nine ! - What ? - I asked you a question . - Where 's your daughter ? - Ten ! I don 't have time for your questions . I 'm trying to get people ready for battle . Don 't waste my time ! I am going to keep wasting your time until you give me a straight answer . _ Most of these kids have read The Amazing Goddess of the Badlands . _ _ And I want to know where she is . Why isn 't the Amazing Goddess fighting by their side ? My daughter 's been through a lot recently . Right now she 's not capable of picking up a weapon . But my child is ? And you should know we 're not the only recruits asking these questions . Many among us think the Votanis Collective is a human problem . Really ? Really , a human problem ? And they believe that Rahm Tak would treat the Votans with kindness if he took Defiance . That 's a fantasy . That 's what some believe . Do you believe that ? Do you believe that ? I believe that if your family isn 't going to fight for Defiance , then neither is mine . Sorry . He 's my dad . Anyone else ? Keep them moving . Let 's go . Okay , and ... 16 , 17 , 18 ! Thank you for coming . What happened to you ? Spent the day in basic training . Nolan 's whipping us into shape to face your good pal Rahm Tak . Rahm 's no friend of mine . Any word of your mother ? They haven 't caught her yet . They never will . She 's too smart . Where 's my grandson ? Home . Ignoring a condemned man 's wishes , it 's kind of petty , don 't you think ? You helped Rahm Tak , and now that psychopath is coming for us , and if we can 't fight him off , well , then my half-human child is going to be brutally murdered . So , no , Dad , Luke will not be visiting you ever . I had no choice . There 's always a choice . Look , the minute you got home , you and Mom should have warned Nolan and Amanda . You were Rahm 's hostage . He would have killed you . I escaped . Well , how was I supposed to know that would happen ? You know , even if Rahm Tak had killed me , so what ? I would have died protecting my child and my home . I 'd be with Christie now . My death would have meaning . You ... you should have told the truth . You and Mom should have helped . Don 't leave . Please , wait . I 've failed you , Alak . I 've failed our family . If I could change my actions , if I could murder Rahm Tak and raise the Arch , I would do so . If killing myself and your mother would bring back Christie , I would cut both our throats . But my time is done here . I 'm out of choices . So I must ask _ You know , it 's not really the best time . Please , hear me out . I want you to go to Amanda . Tell her that I cannot face human justice . I want to die properly . At the hands of our own people . On a shaming rack . Just so that I 'm clear , rather than a quick death by hanging , you 're asking to be tortured to death by weights slowly pulling your arms and legs from their sockets . This is what you 're asking ? It 's the only way to remove the stain from my immortal soul . Alak . I 'll see what I can do . [ door opens and closes ] No , no way , Nolan . I won 't do it . You think I want to be asking you to do this ? I know you don 't want to fight . Then stop trying to make me . You don 't join the militia , I can 't defend the town . They 're going to coming here , they 're going to drag every human being they can find into Darby Square , line them up , and shoot them in the head ten at a time . This is how we stop them . Why ? Huh ? Why does everyone hurt each other ? Why is our world like this ? I don 't know , kid . This is how it is . You ever get scared ? All the time . Are you scared now ? Yeah . And tired . [ chuckles ] I love you . - [ snarls ] - [ gasps ] You 're dirty . You need to be cleaned . Actually , I bathed fairly recent ... - I insist . - [ screams ] You 're very pretty . Soft . [ sniffs ] You smell nice . I see why my father enjoys you . You flatter me . Omec beauty is the standard by which the rest of us are judged . For my people , a Castithan slave was a mark of status . The finest sparked bitter competitions to see who could spoil them with expensive gifts and fine perfumes . But when the enchanted Castithan was used up , they 'd be put down in the pens ... force-fed , oiled until it was fit to be consumed . You know , my father tires of his concubines faster than most . I 've been told that when he 's done with one , he 'd give it to his children as a living toy . It is a great honor to devour your father 's whore . You know , I think I 'm clean now . [ breathing heavily ] You 're more trouble than you 're worth . [ panting ] [ gasps ] Please . I will leave here . Just tell me what you want . [ snarls ] [ gasps ] I want you to die frightened . [ whimpers ] [ both growling ] [ chokes ] I carefully consider the commands I give you , Kindzi . I expect you to obey them precisely . Now in a moment , I 'm going to relieve the pressure from your throat , and you will apologize to Stahma . [ gasping ] I apologize ... Stahma . Think nothing of it . [ TV chatter ] Conrad ? [ film reel clicking ] What you 've done to it . All That Heaven Allows . I remembered how much you loved Douglas Sirk . I don 't know what to say . Well , how about saying , " Wow , Conrad , that was incredibly thoughtful , and I wish our time together would never end " ? All good things must . They don 't have to . Not this time . Jess , I 'm leaving tomorrow . It 's a big truck . Plenty of room for an extra passenger . What , are you just going to take me away from all of this ? You know , when I agreed to come here , I didn 't know what to expect . Packed up the film , the guns , hoped for the best . And ? The best was here . I can 't go away with you . [ sighs ] Defiance is my home , and I need to be here to defend it . Defiance isn 't your home . You were deployed here by the Earth Republic . Well , guess what . E-Rep is dead . Your boyfriend Tommy is dead . I 'm alive , and I 'm here . And I want a future with the girl I never stopped loving . Let 's just watch the movie . ( Cary on TV ) I just hadn 't thought about marriage . ( Ron on TV ) Why do you think I 've been seeing you ? Alak tells me you 've asked to die on the shaming rack . What 's your angle ? I have quite possibly delivered this town into the hands of a madman . I 've destroyed my family . I 've put the lives of everyone I love at risk . For a Castithan , atonement can only be achieved by what you humans would call " rough justice . " I could explain this in greater detail , but what 's the point ? My reasons don 't matter . I suggest you ask yourself if you 'd prefer my death be quick and clean or a slow , agonizing public spectacle ? Hmm . Your request is granted . Hey . What 's up ? I wanted to talk to you . By all means . I want details . What 's going on with Von Bach , huh ? You 've been seeing a lot of him . I know . Crazy , right ? All these years hating the guy , I forgot how much I liked him . Well , I really like his guns . So I guess everyone 's happy . [ sighs ] What 's wrong ? Conrad asked me to go away with him . What do you mean ? Leave Defiance ? For good ? [ sighs ] Conrad Von Bach broke your heart . Actually , it was his family that was more of the issue . All right , now you 're just making excuses . I mean , come on , Jess , you can 't seriously be considering this . He loves me . Oh , please . What ... and do you love him ? I don 't know . Maybe . Okay , well , if he truly loves you , he 'll wait for you . We 're in the middle of a crisis at the moment . We 're leaving tomorrow . Plans change . - Talk to him . - Amanda . - I 'll go with you . - Please . We 'll figure this out together . I don 't want to figure it out . Then what do you want ? Your support . [ sighs ] What 's the big rush ? I 'm scared . Join the club . You know what my childhood was like . After the raiders killed my family , I was alone , and then ... Are we trading childhood - sob stories here ? - When they would turn their backs around , - I would just steal their food . - Because if that 's what we 're doing , - I will win . - Will you stop ? Will you just listen to me ? I was afraid all the time . I was scared of getting caught . I was scared of dying . I was scared of not dying . And then when I was 16 , I joined the Earth Republic , and then suddenly , there was food and clothes and people who kept track of me , and they were my family . Then it was all taken away , and now I am just that scared , lonely kid all over again . Look , you still have family , all right ? I 'm your family , and you cannot turn your back on me . Not now , not when I 'm trying to hold all of this together . For me , family has to be more than good intentions . And I don 't think that you can protect us from what 's coming . Not me , not yourself , and not this town . I 'm so sorry . [ scoffs ] You 're a coward . [ door creaks open ] I 'm not sure if Amanda told you ... She told me . Defiance thanks you for your service . It wasn 't an easy choice , Nolan . You know how much Defiance means to me , and if I had any other option ... Like I said , Defiance thanks you for your service . Reporting for duty . Good to have you on board , soldier . Hey , look , the Amazing Goddess . Thank you . Okay . Here you go , boys . [ gunfire ] You 're a machine . You should see me when I 'm hunting kanga-rats . So what do you think ? For the most part , it 's what we expected ... pow farmers and shopkeepers , inexperienced but doing their best . There is some real talent here , Indur 's kid . He may be inexperienced , but he 's probably the best long-range shooter I 've ever seen . We 've got a handful of professional soldiers like myself . Throw in Irisa , we might just have the beginnings of a strike force . [ exhales ] [ dramatic music ] ♪ ♪ [ breathing heavily ] [ grunts ] ♪ ♪ [ gasping ] Irisa . Tommy , it 's me . Tommy , I 'm so sorry . [ sobs ] I 'm so sorry , Tommy . I 'm so sorry . I wish I could take it all back . - Okay , okay . Come on . - I wish ... I wish I could take it back . Come on . Get her out of here . Just don 't let this fall apart . All right , people . Come on , let 's bring it in . Sorry . I 'm sorry . ( Nolan ) I screwed up . I dragged my daughter down here when I knew she was in no condition to fight , because Indur made a good point . A fair point . How can we ask of you that you risk your own lives and the lives of your children defending Defiance unless we 're prepared to do the same ? Fair point . But here 's the thing , people . Throughout history , the strong have been called upon to defend the weak . I know it 's not fair . But those of you who serve , sweat , and bleed and push your bodies past their breaking point spend endless hours in combat training for those who cannot show up themselves , who are incapable , or who can 't be bothered or just won 't do it . The strong defend the weak . It 's not fair , but it is right . It 's our responsibility , and it 's our privilege . Now let me make one thing clear . My daughter is not weak . She 's saved my life more times than I can count . She 's strong . She 's possibly the strongest person I know . And I believe in her . I believe that when the time comes , she will stand with us , shoulder to shoulder defending Defiance , but it will be on her terms . I have to go back . No , not today . And in the meantime , this militia , this confederacy of the strong will hold the line with pride . We will face The Beast , and we will defeat him . Do we have an understanding ? - Defiance ! - Defiance ! ( all ) Defiance ! ( Nolan ) All right . That 's what I wanted to hear . Everybody , back to your firing lines . We got work to do . [ indistinct chatter ] Second thoughts ? Absolutely not . Come on . Well , congratulations . You are officially healthy enough to execute . I noticed the vote to convict me was unanimous . It wouldn 't have changed the outcome , and I still have to live in this town after you 're gone . Well , I respect your pragmatism . I am going to miss you .

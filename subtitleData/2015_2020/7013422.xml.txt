( ALPHA 5 ) Why do you keep looking at each other ? Is that , like , a human thing ? Fascinating . Oh , it 's working ! This is great ! It 's working ! - Zordon , are you there ? Zordon ! - ( DISORIENTING CHATTER ) ( BOTH SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Okay . Okay . Come on ! Let 's go ! Move ! Go , go , go ! ( ALL GASP ) Come forward , please ! Do we have a choice ? Don 't think so . ( ALPHA 5 SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ) Look ! It 's Zordon ! What ? Zordon , they don 't know who you are . Come in ! Come in ! ( ZORDON ) These are them ? They 're so small . Funny , I said the same thing , actually . You mean to tell me that the fate of the universe is placed in the hands of these ... these children ? The universe ? That 's a big place . ( ALPHA 5 ) They 're teenagers . Somewhere between infancy and full maturity . - It 's hard to explain , really . I don 't ... - Show me the coins . The morphing grid is never wrong . If the power coins have returned to the ship with these ... Teenagers ! With these teenagers , then these teenagers are the Power Rangers . Power Rangers ! What ? ( ZACK ) Okay , quick question . Hello . Hate to interrupt . Did I just hear you say we 're Power Rangers ? Yes . Yes . You are the Power Rangers . Any other questions ? - No , I think I 'm good . - ( ZORDON ) Good . I got a question . Um ... Hi , how you doing ? Oh , okay ... um , my name is Billy . Billy Cranston . - Kids used to call me Billy Crams-tons ... - Billy ! Stop . ( WHISPERS ) I 'm sorry . Uh ... the images here in this sphere tell a history of the Power Rangers . Looks like the Power Rangers were a team that protected life . And life is a bright light . Or ... a piece of light ? ( ZORDON ) Yes . Yes , very good , Billy . It is called the Zeo Crystal . ( ALPHA 5 ) Oh , I love this part . This is good . And every planet in the universe that has life has a piece of the crystal buried inside it . ( ALPHA 5 ) Sixty-five million years ago , Zordon 's team died defending the crystal here in what is now Angel Grove . - ( ZORDON ) The coins have chosen you five . - ( ALPHA 5 ) Yes ! I knew it ! Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal and life on earth . Because ... we ... are the Power Rangers ? - He 's smart ! - ( KIMBERLY SCOFFS ) I 'm sorry , um , is this some kind of joke ? Like , I 'm standing here with a wet wedgie . My socks are soaked . We 're squishing around in here . We 're talking to a wall . I mean , guys ... - Silence ! - ( GASPS ) ( DOOR CREAKING ) ( RITA ) Dig ! Dig , Goldar ! ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( BREATHING RAPIDLY ) ( POWER RANGERS GASPING ) ( COUGHING ) ( ALPHA 5 ) Sir , I 'm detecting elevated heart rates . They 're ... they 're very scared . I don 't understand . Why would you show us that nightmare ? ( ZORDON ) It 's not a nightmare . It 's the future . - Was that for real ? - Felt like it . - And who was that woman ? - Her name is Rita Repulsa . She will create Goldar , a huge monster who will rip the crystal from the earth , and all life on your planet will die . With the crystal , Rita will have the power to create and destroy worlds . So , let me guess . You want us to kill this woman ? R ... Rita ? Ay , ay , ay ! Rita ! She must be stopped . When is she coming ? ( ALPHA 5 ) She 's already here . My best guess is we have 11 months . Oh , I 'm sorry , days . Days , 11 days . ( TRINI ) If we 're the Power Rangers and this is our ship , if I walk through that door right now , will it open for me ? Yes , of course . Let 's go . - ( ALPHA 5 ) Whoa , what you doing ? - ( SIGHS ) No , no , no , come back ! No . No , please , don 't leave . ( ZORDON ) Jason , my ranger team died defending the crystal from Rita . That 's why I 'm in this wall . How 'd you know my name ? Because it 's you , Jason Scott . You are the leader . You are the Red Ranger . Rita was a ranger , too . And my friend . But she betrayed us . Wanted more power . She lost her way . Now she is just pure evil . You must bring them back . All of the rangers . You must train your team to stop Rita before she has the strength to find the crystal . Okay . I 'm leaving . - And I only speak for myself when I ... - No ! You speak for all of them . You know that , deep down , what I 'm saying is true . You were born for this . You all waited . Even you . Who ... exactly are you ? Really ? Now you 're gonna ask me who I am ? - Look , her name is Didi . - Trini . She 's new at school . Transferred in a month ago . We have English together , right ? I 've been at Angel Grove for over a year now . We have biology together . Good talk . Wait , look ... none of us really know each other , okay ? But somehow ... we were all in the same place at the same time when Billy found those coins . - And ... - Wait , wait , wait ! Can I ask a question ? Are we really superheroes ? Like are we more like Iron Man or Spider-Man ? 'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider , but I feel really good , you know , not as ... ( CHUCKLING ) All right , look , bro , trust me , you 're not a superhero . Why are you talking to us like you 're the boss now ? Hey , hold up . Can any of this Rita stuff be real ? Can any of it be true ? I don 't know . But I know that the answer to what 's wrong with us and to what 's happening to us ... is here . - So what are you saying ? - ( WATER SLOSHING ) I think we gotta come back . I can 't make you come back here . But 4 : 00 tomorrow ... I 'll be here . Hey , Jason , we don 't ... we don 't ... ( SCOFFS ) - That makes sense . That makes sense . - Of course . I don 't know why I didn 't think about that one in the first place . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( BOTH SPEAKING MANDARIN ) So where were you today ? Were you with friends ? Do you have any friends ? - Why are you so tired ... - Okay , this is the problem . You ask her four questions before she 's even answered the first . Because she 's like a ghost around here . She needs to start communicating . - June ... - Say something . - Speak ! I just ... - Relax . Okay . Relax . Okay , Trini , let 's start over . Please tell us one thing you did today . Me and four kids from Angel Grove found a spaceship buried underground . What ? I 'm pretty sure I 'm a superhero . Cool . Not cool . Pee in that cup ! This to remind me of my screw-up ? No . ( SIGHS ) Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it and ... you know , the frame 's straight and the engine still runs . Figure I 'd leave it up to you to decide if you wanted to fix it . Oh , shit . ( OFFICER ) Mr. Scott , there 's been an incident on your boat . It 's a terrible situation . You gotta come with me . ( NEWSCASTER ) A series of grisly crime scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet of Angel Grove reeling . - Bodies were discovered ... - ( RITA ) I 'm building Goldar for you ... . This rash of violence has the town on edge . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ( RITA SINGSONG ) Goldar 's coming . Goldar 's coming . Goldar 's coming . Goldar 's coming . What the hell you doing ? ( RITA ) I need gold . I will build my beautiful Goldar . ( SINGSONG ) Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal . I take the universe . Me , too ! ( LAUGHING ) ( INHALING RAGGEDLY ) ( RITA SNARLS ) ( MAN GROANING ) ( MAN SCREAMING ) - ( CHUCKLES ) What 's up , crazy girl ? - Hey . ( JASON ) Shall we do this ? ( ZORDON ) You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger . You must never use your powers for personal gain . You must never escalate a fight , unless your enemy forces you to . And you must never reveal your identity . Ever . To assume your ranger identities , you need to morph . Have any of you morphed before ? - Yes . But only in the shower . - ( ALL SNICKERING ) Okay , okay . Let 's step into the footprints , please . Let 's try this . Standing in this circle as a team , you can easily connect to the morphing grid . - Do you feel it ? - ( ALPHA 5 ) Yeah , they do . No . Not feeling it . ( ZORDON ) You need to morph to get your armor . ( GASPS ) I knew it ! We do get armor . ( CHUCKLES ) Jason ! We get armor ! Oh , we get armor . Cool . When do you give us the armor ? ( ZORDON ) You already have it inside of you . You bring it out by connecting to each other and connecting to the morphing grid . Clear your minds and focus . Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life . ( ALPHA 5 ) Yes ! ( ZORDON ) You must become those warriors . ( ALPHA 5 ) Become the warriors ! - ( ALPHA 5 GROANS ) - ( KIMBERLY ) What ? What ? What , did it ... did it work ? Alpha 5 , why didn 't they morph ? Yeah , I don 't ... I don 't know , sir . It 's ... it 's disturbing . Very disturbing . This might take some time . We don 't have time . If they can 't morph , what are we supposed to do ? ( ZORDON ) They 'll have to train without armor . - They need to prepare . - Without armor ? Sir , that 'll be very painful . Take them down to the pit . ( SIGHS ) All right , follow me . We 're going to the pit ! Jason , I don 't wanna find out what the pit is . So this is the pit . It 's nice , right ? ( ZORDON ) Alpha 5 , begin the exercise . ( ALPHA 5 ) Uh ... sorry , guys . - What exercise ? - Chill out , dude . ( ZORDON ) These creatures before you are a simulation of Rita 's army . They 're called Putties . You must get through them to get to her . ( BILLY ) No , no , no , no , Jason . Cool . Look , relax , guys . It 's a hologram . - Like a video game . Look . - ( GRUNTING ) - ( GROANS ) - Whoa ! - ( GROANS ) - ( BILLY ) That 's a strong-ass hologram . ( LAUGHS ) ( HOARSELY ) Not a video game . ( ZORDON ) This is why you must morph into your armor . If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army , it 'll be the beginning of the end . Rangers , welcome to training . - I 'm so excited you guys are back . - ( POP MUSIC PLAYING ) - Aim for the center mass . - ( GROANS ) One more time . Come on , duck the punches . Find their weak side . - ( GRUNTS ) - Oh ... Let 's go a couple o ' hits , okay ? Hit one ... No , let 's try it again . ( ALPHA 5 ) Now this is exciting . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Yeah , Trini ! - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GROANS ) ( BOTH ) Hai ! Ready , master Billy ? ( GROANS ) You need to learn the element of surprise . Ready ? Let 's go again . All right , Billy , lighter on your feet . Hands up . ( ZACK SPEAKING MANDARIN ) ( SCHOOL BELL RINGING ) ( COACH ) Play with some energy now ! Let 's go ! ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( ALPHA 5 ) Focus ! Focus ! Everybody just focus ! - ( EXCLAIMS ) - ( PUTTY GROANS ) Lucky shot . ( GRUNTS ) You guys all know you could be murdered , right ? No . ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) ( ZORDON ) You must shed your masks to wear this armor . ( BILLY ) I don 't feel anything . ( ZACK GROANS ) ( ZORDON ) Take them down to the pit . ( ALPHA 5 ) Now watch me ... slip , grab , lift . Yeah ! Slip , grab , lift ! ( GRUNTING ) Yes ! ( ZORDON ) Think only of each other , and the morphing grid will open to you . Is it working ? ( TRINI ) No , it 's not . Come on ! Try harder ! ( JASON ) Let 's just concentrate . ( TRINI ) I 've been concentrating though , Jason . ZACK : ' Cause we haven 't been concentrating ... all we need to do is just concentrate . Don 't tell me to concentrate . Just follow my lead . Let 's not fight with each other . ( TRINI ) Zack , now is not the time . ( FRUSTRATED GROAN ) Come on . Let 's go train . The information we need to triangulate the location of the crystal was lost in the battle . So ... Billy , are you listening to me ? Billy , what are you doing ? - Billy ! - ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ON STEREO ) Where 's the crystal ? Find it , Billy , find it . Where 's the crystal ? ( GRUNTS ) There . One , two ... Okay , 17 degrees north ... ( DRIVER ) Hey , idiot , watch where you 're going ! - One , two , three ... - ( DRIVER 2 ) Wake up ! ( NEWSCASTER ) Two fishermen were laid to rest today at Saint Andrew 's Cemetery . Residents of Angel Grove are feeling the shock . Fear has the town on edge . This series of murders has police baffled as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene . What is now being dubbed " Angel Grove 's Gold Killer " is still on the loose . ... Rita manages to create Goldar ... ( GRUNTS ) Are you listening to me ? - ( GRUNTS ) - And he rips the crystal from the ground , it 'll be like 10,000 nuclear bombs washing over Earth . ( ZACK ) Supposed to freak us out ? You keep making this harder . We 're busting our asses . Feel free to throw us a bone at some point . Yes , I see you busting your " asses . " So I 've decided to give you some inspiration . What you will find beyond this wall will forever change your lives . Come on . ( ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY ) The Zords ! - Pretty cool , right ? - ( BILLY ) Yeah . They take on the form of the most powerful organism on the planet . When these Zords formed , dinosaurs reigned supreme . They will be an extension of you . And their power ... is all but limitless . ( BILLY WHOOPS , LAUGHS ) But you 're not ready for this power . When you morph , your armor will make you one with the Zords . So come on , let 's go train . Today 's the day you become rangers ! I can feel it ! - Okay . - Let 's go . Yeah . Let 's go . ( ZORD ROARS ) ( ZACK YELLING ) This was a bad idea . Okay , okay , uh , signals , brakes . Brakes , I need brakes ! Manual . Man-u-al . Where are the brakes ... Alpha 5 ! ( ZACK SCREAMING ) Ahh ! Oh , crap ! Hey ! Move ! Move ! Out of the way ! ( ALL ) # Go tell it on the mountain # ( ZACK SCREAMING ) You have to remember that in today 's training lesson the important thing is to ... - Wait . Where 's Zack ? - Seriously ? Run , run , run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! ( YELPING ) - ( ALL SCREAMING ) - ( ALPHA 5 ) It 's bad ! ( COUGHING ) ( ALL GROANING ) You all right ? - ( SPLUTTERS ) Ay , ay , ay ! - ( ZACK WHOOPS ) All right , my bad , my bad . That 's on me , right there . What 's your problem ? You could 've killed yourself . Or us . - Back off , bossman . - Hey ! ( BILLY ) Oh , come on , guys . Wow . - Guys , guys , guys , come on ! - Watch it ! ( ALPHA 5 ) Wait . What are you doing ? Just stop fighting , please ! What ? ( TRINI ) That 's dope . What ? I got something on my f ... - ( ZACK ) Yeah ! - ( BILLY ) Whoa ! Okay , now that 's cool ! Oh , yeah ! - Hold still . - Don 't touch it . Zack , don 't touch it . Zack , do not touch it . ( ALL ) Whoa ! ( ZACK ) Where 'd it go ? Bring it back . Bring it back , dude . ( ZORDON ) Get out . Training is over for today . Go home . I 'm sorry , ( STAMMERS ) he just morphed . He did it . You saw it , right ? ( ZORDON ) Do it again . All of you . Any of you . - Billy . How 'd you do it , Billy ? - Come on , Billy , let 's do it . - ( JASON ) Show us what you did . - ( ZACK ) Come on . Do it again . - Do it again ! - I 'm trying , I 'm trying ! I can 't focus ! Billy , how 'd you do it ? Show us . Okay , we don 't know how . ( ZORDON ) That 's what I thought . If you can 't morph , you are not rangers . Go home . All of you . ( JASON ) Now what ? Damn . ( KIMBERLY ) Seriously ? ( SIGHS ) ( ZACK ) Hey , guys ... guys , look , uh ... I 'ma stay up here tonight . Make a fire . I got some food if you guys wanna stay . I 'm down . All right . Cool . ( ZORDON ) Jason 's team is failing . I shall destroy Rita myself . There must be a way to free me from this wall . Yes , but the irony is , is that you need these rangers to morph . If they morph , you can harness that energy to regenerate your body and come back through . ( GROANS ) There 's got to be another way ! I can 't ... ( ZACK ) What , Zordon ? You can 't what ? Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life ? That 's what all this has been about , right ? You coming back ? This has only ever been about protecting the crystal . Rita could be building Goldar as we speak . - Don 't underestimate me or my team . - You can 't stop him . She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die . And we need you . Because you were so successful at stopping her last time . I died burying those coins in hopes that they would find the next real rangers . Those who are worthy . Well , sorry to disappoint you . I don 't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong . - I can go home and get that . - Jason , you need me out of this wall . To help lead this team ! Your team 's dead . And you 're just as scared as we are . These ... are all 24 karat gold bands . - ( BELL JINGLES ) - Hello , I 'll be right with you . They 're at the top of your budget ... ( MAN ) I 'll get you anything you want . ( CHUCKLES ) Aw . You 're so sweet . ( MAN ) Get my cookie anything she wants . I 'll be right back . Uh ... can I help you ? Gold . I 'm interested ... in gold . Yeah . We have some very nice pieces here . - ( LOW RUMBLING ) - ( SIGHS CONTENTEDLY ) Come closer . - Closer . Closer . Closer . - Oh ... ( GAGGING ) - This . Give it to me ! - Of course ! Okay . Here you go . - ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - ( MURMURING NERVOUSLY ) Ah ... Grow . Grow . More ! - ( DOOR BELL JINGLES ) - Police ! Don 't move ! Drop your ... weapon , and put your hands on your head . Do it now ! Do what I say , lady ! Lady ... I like the sound of " lady . " ( OFFICER ) Get on the ground and you won 't get hurt . ( CACKLES ) ( INHALES DEEPLY ) Unit five , I need backup at Fenix Jewelers . Shots fired . I repeat , shots fired . Get down ! - ( RIFLE FIRES ) - ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) It 's been too long since I raised my beautiful creatures . Did you miss me ? ( PUTTY SNARLING ) Oh , my God . - ( RITA ) Kill him ! - ( PUTTY GROWLING ) - ( ZACK ) All right . - ( POWER RANGERS LAUGHING ) If I weren 't stuck in this wall , ( IMITATES ZORDON ) I would eat that junk food ! What happened back there ? Nothing . Don 't worry about it . Billy , how 'd you do it ? How 'd you morph ? I don 't know . What are you guys thinking about when we 're trying to morph ? ( IMITATES ZORDON ) You must shed your masks to wear this armor . ( ALL CHUCKLE ) ( IMITATES ZORDON ) Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you . Yeah , that 's better . Well , maybe it 's because we don 't know each other . Maybe that 's why we can 't morph . ( KIMBERLY ) Okay . No , I 'm serious . Let 's do this . For real . - ( MOUTHS ) What ? - I 'm Zack . And I am a Power Ranger . ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( ALL ) Hi , Zack . Truth : I live in the Melody Mobile Home Park . It 's just me and my mom . And my mom ? ( ECHOING ) My mom is the best ! But my mom , she 's sick . I do what I can , but ... but I 'm scared . Sometimes I get too scared to stay there at night , ' cause ... 'cause I 'm afraid she can 't make it . And if she goes ... when she goes , I got nobody else . Look , ( CHUCKLES ) I think being with you guys is good for me . Let 's do that . Let 's tell our secrets . It 'll ... it 'll help us . Okay , I got a secret . - I like country music . - ( CHUCKLES ) What ? No , matter of fact , I love country music . ( ALL LAUGHING ) And I don 't ... I don 't miss my dad as much . I mean , coming to the mine with him was all I had . But coming to the mine with you guys is just as good . Yeah . Bigger secret is why were you in detention ? - I blew up my lunchbox . - What ? - What , it was a accident , okay ? - ( ALL LAUGHING ) - Of course . - ( BILLY ) My lunchbox was in my locker . Boom goes the lunchbox , in detention goes Billy . But let 's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in ... in detention , too , so ... Not tonight . Skip me . What about you , dude ? Why don 't you tell us who you really are ? Because everyone knows exactly who I am . Okay . What about you , crazy girl ? I could tell you anything and you 'd have to believe me . Okay , um ... I 'm the new girl . Always . Three schools in three years . What 's crazy is I like it that way . You know , it 's just easier . Nobody ever has to get to know me and uh , my parents don 't have to worry about my relationships . ( ZACK ) Boyfriend troubles ? Yeah . Boyfriend troubles . Girlfriend troubles ? My family is so normal . Too normal . They believe in labels . They 'd like for me to , um ... dress differently . Talk more . Have the kind of friends they want me to have . It 's just ... I don 't know how to tell them what 's really going on with me . ( INHALES SHARPLY ) And I 've never said any of this out loud . Well , it 's cool . You 're with us now . Am I ? What does that mean ? When all this is over . Are we Power Rangers or ... are we friends ? ( TRINI GASPS ) - ( GASPS ) - ( RITA ) Do you know who I am ? ( BREATHES SHAKILY ) Yes . I was once just like you . So pretty . Innocent . Are all the rangers on Zordon 's new team as young as you ? - ( GRUNTS ) - ( RITA YELLS ) Delightful ! ( TRINI YELPS ) Have you morphed yet ? Trick question . If you could morph , we 'd be having a very different conversation . ( SNIFFS ) Mmm . The Yellow Ranger . ( LAUGHS MOCKINGLY ) Should I kill you ? I killed the Yellow Ranger ... before . And I loved it ! Oh , you want your armor . I 'll show you mine , if you show me yours . ( BREATHING RAGGEDLY ) ( TRINI GRUNTS ) No , please , you 're hurting me ! You 're so strong ! ( CHUCKLING ) I 'm just kidding . You 've got spunk , little Yellow . I see myself in you . I was an outsider on Zordon 's team just like you . All I need to know is , where is the Zeo Crystal ? ( GASPING ) I don 't know . Sadly , I believe you . Tomorrow , I am going to destroy Angel Grove . But , in exchange for your life , you will find out where that crystal is , and you will come to me . We can have a little deal , Didi , my friend . ( TRINI GROANING ) - Shh ! It 's me . - ( MUFFLED ) Kim . How did you get in here ? I 'm a superhero . And you left your window open . Is everything okay ? I think I 'm the reason we can 't morph . I haven 't really been honest . Okay . I punched Ty Fleming in the face because he told everyone I was the meanest person he 'd ever met . And he was right . Well , that can 't be true . Okay . Whoa . - You took that picture ? - No . Amanda Clark took that picture . Of herself . But she shared it with me . Privately . She trusted me . And you sent that pic to ... to Ty ? With a text that said , " Is this the girl you wanna bring home to your mom ? " Oh . I didn 't realize how mean it was until I saw her face . Kim , there 's literally thousands of photos going around school . I don 't care about them . I care about this . I did this . I had to sit in Mr. Detmer 's office with Amanda 's father and watch as they showed him that photo of his daughter . In his eyes , for the first time , I could see who I 'd become . You know , so I lied . I blamed everyone else . I wanted to die , that 's why ... that 's why when you asked me to run away , I was ready . Okay , listen . Start over . Erase that picture right now . - Jason , it can 't be erased . - Then live with it . You did an awful thing . It doesn 't make you an awful person . Just be the person you wanna be . ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) ( KIMBERLY ) So , we all got the same text . So where is she ? I 'm here . Look , Rita came to my house tonight . - What ? - Yeah . She 's real ... - insane . - ( KIMBERLY GASPS ) She nearly killed me . She was trying to get me to join her . She said she 'd spare my life , if I could keep a secret . What secret ? At dawn , the destruction of Angel Grove begins . This is real . This is the end . No , it 's not . Where is she ? She said to meet her where the dead ships live . Okay . That 's the boatyard by the docks , right ? - Let 's go . - ( KIMBERLY ) What ? ( SCOFFS ) Are you serious ? No one ? Jason , we 're not even Power Rangers yet . I say we go back to Zordon . Okay , the only reason Zordon wanted us to become Power Rangers is so that he can come back to life . What makes you say that ? Because he told me . Wait , so this all is a lie ? Of course it was a lie , Billy . We failed . Let 's stop being delusional about being a team of superheroes . We 're all screw-ups . And as much as I hate this scrubby , bullshit town , I don 't wanna just sit around and watch it die , okay ? Let 's go and do the one thing that 's been asked of us and kill Rita . ( GASPS ) You know this is a really bad idea , right ? The worst . Let 's vote . Show of hands . Let 's do it . ( JASON WHISPERING ) Okay . Okay , let 's go . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ( WHISPERS ) Take the left , I 'll take the right . Okay . Got it . ( ALL YELLING ) ( ALL GASP ) ( MUFFLED WHIMPERING ) - We 'll , untie him . Hold this . - No , no , no . Let 's just think about this , okay ? Oh , shit ! ( YELLS ) Right on time . I was beginning to think you were too dumb to know where the dead ships live . Let 's play . - ( RITA YELLING ) - ( POWER RANGERS GROANING ) ( GROANS ) Five little rangers tied up like fish . The leader ? Oh , hello , Red . - ( GRUNTS ) - Oh ! ( CHUCKLES ) You 're not entirely disappointing . Oh , look at you . Trying to figure out my plan . I 'll just tell you . Yellow has led you to your deaths . - ( STRUGGLING ) - Because I 'm going to kill you , one by one , until you tell me , where is my crystal ? We don 't know . No , Red . You don 't know ! But guess what ? One of you does . Who could it be ? Eenie , meenie , miney ... Blue . Blue , so loyal . Pure of heart . Tell the class what you know ! - Where 's my crystal ? - ( STRUGGLING ) You can tell me now , Blue , or you can tell me after I kill all of your friends . - Let 's start with Black . - ( GROANS ) - ( GASPING ) - ( JASON ) No ! Stop ! No . He dies in three , two ... Okay ! Okay ! ( GASPING ) Don 't hurt my friends , all right ? It 's at a dining establishment . Where ? What does that mean ? What 's it called ? It 's a Krispy Kreme . - Krispy Kreme ? - Krispy Kreme . This is a special place ? - Very special . - It must be . The source of life itself is buried there . Thank you , Blue , for being so weak . Zordon would lose all respect for me if I don 't kill you . - At least one of you . - ( KIMBERLY ) What ? ( JASON ) No ! Billy ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) - Billy ! - Billy ! - Jason , we gotta help him ! - Billy ! Billy ! ( RITA ) You 're not ready to kill me . Ha ! You 're not worthy . ( KIMBERLY ) Quick ! Get the rope ! ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( ZACK ) Billy ! ( KIMBERLY GRUNTS ) Billy ? He 's gonna be okay , right ? Come on . Hey , hey . You got this , big guy . Come on . ( CRYING ) He 's dead . He 's dead . No . ( SOBBING ) Pick him up . Help me pick him up ! Come on ! ( MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING ) Okay . Okay . Come on , Billy . We got you , buddy . Take him . Take him . Yeah . - Let 's just put him down . - Okay . - ( TRINI ) Slow , slow , slow . - Master Billy . Do something , okay ? There must be something you can do for him . I told you that you were not ready . Zordon , please help us , okay ? Please . There 's nothing that I could do for him . We were both reckless with our teams . ( SIGHS ) No . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , guys . He 's dead because of me . No , Jason , it was all of us . No , I pushed it . And as usual I made the wrong decision . ( STAMMERS ) Out of ... out of fear , anger ... I don 't know , I was just so angry . He 's ... he 's a great kid , you know ? And he loved us . He loved ... being a ranger . I 'm sorry , Billy . I 'd trade my life for yours if I could . Maybe he traded his life for us . ( ZACK ) Yeah . Probably did . I would . Me too . Yeah . Me too . Me too . It 's just the four of us now . The truth is , whatever we 've said to each other , it doesn 't matter . This . This is the only thing that matters . ( SNIFFLES ) She 's right . ( ALPHA 5 ) Zordon ! Zordon ! Look at the grid ! This is your time ! Do ... do you see it ? The grid is open ! Step through ! Yes , I see it . I see it . Step through , Zordon ! - Hey ! - What 's happening ? ( ALPHA 5 ) The morphing grid is open ! - What 's going on ? - ( ZORDON SCREAMING ) Zordon ? Master ? Where is he ? ( ALPHA 5 ) He must have stepped through the grid . ( TRINI ) Alpha , where 'd he go ? I don 't know where he is . Zordon , what ? Why didn 't you step though ? That was your only chance . I know .

 Previously on extant : You haven 't told me your name . Ahdu . Who is he ? My son . There are 29 known deaths . All women who died from Accelerated pregnancies . Shepherd : All of which trace back To your son . Dad , i 'm pregnant . Lucy , where are you ... ( woman screams ) Lucy made her first hybrid kill . Ethan , i 'm your mother . No . She is . Molly : How the hell did julie gelineau End up with my son ? It 's complicated . When things get complicated ... Does somebody end up getting hit by a train ? Unlock the door ! I don 't care how many times you try To erase me from his memory- - I 'm his mother . Look at yourself , molly . Are you even capable of taking care of a child ? Molly : Something is happening to me . I 'm going crazy . Don 't touch me ! Who did that ? I think i did . Richter : So that 's ... My dna . Yeah . It 's a triple helix . Triple ? Human dna is a double helix , if memory serves . It was me , jd . I caused that guy to run into traffic . I 'm changing . Into what ? Somehow , my dna has combined With alien dna . I think i 'm becoming A cross-breed of ... Species . How is that even possible ? Maybe it happened with the spores when i was in space . Maybe the gsc did something to you . Or maybe ... The baby did . You took biology , right ? I was a solid d-minus student Like 30 years ago , so don 't ask to test My recall . Okay . Well , there 's something called a ... Fetal microchimerism . During pregnancy , A mother and child share cells and dna . Now , the fetal cells can linger in a mother 's body for decades , Altering her blood and her brain . But if the baby You 're carrying isn 't human ... Exactly . So the headaches , the voices , The sexual appetite- - It all makes sense now . The leftover alien cells have changed My essential dna . All right , so why can 't You just change it back ? There 's no way i can tell if i can reverse this Until i know how far it 's gone . Now ... I need you to extract my bone marrow . With this ? Yeah . I don 't know . Molly , we need to go To a hospital . We need to at least be somewhere sterile . We can 't . They keep records . Molly . This is gonna hurt . No , it won 't . Just gave myself a kick-ass numbing agent . Come on , right here . Never a dull moment . Are you ready ? Yeah . Oh ... Fiona : And in my estimation , It is in ethan 's best interest To be allowed to spend time with dr . Woods . And for her to regain Custody . My husband is dead . Did you kill him because you couldn 't have him ? Is that what you did ? ( gasps ) oh . ( sighs ) Molly : The red and yellow Are human cells . Richter : And the blue ? Hybrid . Gina , expand image to full res . Gina : Here 's full res , molly . That is a buttload of blue . Yeah , but as long as i still have human cells in my Bone marrow , then i have an army to fight back . I have to get Into the lab at the gsc . Maybe i can create A gene-knockout protocol with the spores And find a way to stop The alien cells from reproducing . But right now it may be My only chance to reverse this thing And get my son back . Ethan . What ? I 'm supposed to be having A visitation with him right now . Wait , wait , wait , wait . That information i gave you About john 's accident is pretty damning . I can 't Think about that right now , jd . No , you have to , all right ? The gsc Is not your friend . Tobias shepherd is not your friend . You go back to that lab and they find out What 's going on with you , Molly , they 're not gonna hesitate ... To kill me . I know . ( phone chimes ) Hold on . I got to go . Please , whatever you do , just be careful . ( line ringing ) This is kelsey . Leave it . Kelsey , it 's your dad . In case you didn 't recognize my voice From the first seven messages . Listen , i 'm sorry i missed your doctor 's appointment . I had something come up . Just please call me back . All right ? Thank you . ( phone beeps off ) ( doorbell chimes ) Who is it , hank ? Hank : Molly woods . Intercom . You weren 't supposed to come until later in the afternoon . Molly : I know , julie . Something has changed . Can i just see ethan for two minutes , please ? It 's okay , mom . Unlock the door , hank . Hank : Door unlocked . Hi , ethan . Hi , molly . What happened to your car ? He crashed . You think i could talk to you for a second ? I know i told you that we were gonna spend time together . And we will . But you 're just gonna have to wait a little while . Ethan : How come ? Well , i 'm ... I 'm sick . But i 'm working really hard To get better . How long will that take ? I 'm not sure . Now , you won 't remember this , but ... When i went away to space , You were really worried That i wouldn 't come back . And i promised you that i would . And i kept that promise . And i promise you : I 'm gonna come back . Does that mean i stay with julie ? Yeah . She 's gonna take really good care of you till i get better . Okay ? Shepherd : The hybrids have evolved . Their cellular biology is extremely adaptive . They seem to have realized that we Were tracking them using thermal imaging , So they raised their core body temp From 84 degrees to 98.6 . Mimicking Humans and hiding in plain sight . If they look like us , feel like us , How was the humanich able to make that determination ? Lucy . My name is lucy . You can ask me the question . Go ahead , lucy . Explain to them how you were able to differentiate Between hybrid and human . We all know hybrids look exactly like humans . They could be any one of us . See , i was in a crowded room Just like this one . Scanning people . Just as i am now . Everyone 's body temperature Was 98.6 , roughly . But , see ... There was a gentleman . And he was different . He was emitting delta waves , Which the human brain Only emits when sleeping . And this fellow was very much awake . When it became clear he was hybrid , Knowing time was of the essence , I made the call to terminate . Anna : And it was the correct call , lucy . Thank you . The last few weeks The hybrids have gone underground . We don 't know what they 're doing . But we know they 're out there . Multiplying . Quickly . They can blend in , manipulate our minds . They 've killed before and they 'll kill again . And humans Are defenseless against them . How soon can additional humanichs like lucy Be ready for combat ? Right away , sir . And what about the virus , Toby ? I thought dr . Woods Was helping us there . The president has great concerns , as you know . Well , i have news for the president . About dr . Woods . Richter : The gsc is not your friend . Tobias shepherd is not your friend . You go back to that lab and they find out What 's going on with you , Molly , they 're not gonna hesitate ... Molly : To kill me . I know . Shepherd : Molly . There you are . We need to talk . It 's important . You really outdid yourself , lucy . That was quite the show . What 's the matter ? That 's molly . Ethan 's mother . What about her ? Nothing . Nothing at all . As you know , there were concerns About putting you on the virus team . I protected you . I believed in you . And you didn 't disappoint . Congratulations . On what ? Nate took your research breakthrough And ran with it . We 've finished the virus , molly . Really ? Yeah . When will it be deployed ? Well , we 're gearing up for mass production immediately . Thanks to you , We 're gonna wipe those hybrids out permanently . Cheers . Cheers . ( music playing ) Oh , crap . ( music stops ) Woman : You 're a real jerk , you know that ? Nice to see you , too , judge . Dorothy . " judge " is more accurate . I didn 't realize you still had a key . I don 't . Kelsey gave me hers . She called me from the doctor 's office today , upset . Because her father promised He would be at her ultrasound appointment And then he never showed up . Yeah . I screwed up . I know . I 'll say one thing , you are consistent . Missed all those birthday parties and school recitals . We gave up on christmas , but ... But ... She came to me first And not you . That 's it . She came to me , not you , and that 's got you all kinds Of pissed off . No , what has me all kinds of pissed off Is the fact that she gave you a second chance and you blew it . ( scoffs ) i knew you would , but she didn 't . Kids don 't give up . I am in the middle of something right now that i can 't explain . Oh , Let me guess . People 's lives hang in the balance . The fate of mankind Is at stake . If i said yes ? Don 't be a jackass . Here you go . No . No , you tell kelsey To hold on to these just in case . There is no " just in case , " jd . She asked me to give ' em back and to tell you never To call her again . Hold on a second . Our daughter is pregnant . God knows where the father is . So she 's got nobody . She needs us . Both of us , Dorothy . Apparently your daughter doesn 't think so . ( door shuts ) ( whirring ) ( woman and man exclaim ) Look out ! Nice ride . Julie got it for me . Hmm . Someone 's feeling pretty guilty . What do you mean ? When humans do something wrong , They buy you stuff to make you forget . ( chuckles ) Oldest trick in the book . Ethan , Can you keep a secret ? Sure . Today i made a lot of people very happy . And because of that , julie 's gonna be making A lot more humanichs . Pretty soon , there 's gonna be a bunch of us . How does that sound ? Good . Good ? It 's great . Our family is expanding , little brother . You don 't sound Very happy . I am . Happy . Unless ... You don 't care Because you 're spending the afternoon with molly . No , i 'm not , actually . That 's on hold for now . Why ? She 's not feeling well . That 's what she told you ? And you believe her ? Why would she lie ? Humans . It 's in their dna . Have i taught you nothing ? Julie : How many ? A hundred . ( chuckles ) Anna , we can 't do that . Lucy 's program is ready . The bodies have been completed . All you need To do is uplo ... We can 't release them Without smoke tests . That takes time . Julie , grow up . This is not a product launch- - It is a war with a very complicated enemy . I understand that . But there 's a reason John put these protocols in place . He would have never ... Yes , but john isn 't here , is he ? If you could just be a little open-minded , We can resume our life Together . Julie , We don 't have a life together . I 'm gonna find ethan And i 'm gonna shut this thing down . ( beep , line ringing ) Anna : Yes . It 's julie . I think i may have just really screwed up . Start from the beginning . I 'll take care of it . Employee 347 requesting access . Lab a.I. : Security , please . 1127d . I 'm sorry . That code is no longer valid . What are you doing ? I need to get in here . I need the spores . What 's the code ? The spores are gone . They took them to produce the virus . Where 's the dna sequencing ? It 's backed up . Why ? You can 't do that . Classified data is being copied onto an unauthorized drive . ( alarm beeping ) i told you . You can 't do that . Copy aborted . Please obtain proper authorization . Uh , hello . I need security . Guard : Dr. Woods , stop . I need to search your pockets . I 'm sorry , but i 'm late for a meeting . Dr. Woods . ( elevator bell dings ) ( line ringing ) Richter : Molly ? Jd , it 's me . I 'm in trouble . ( engine shuts off ) All right , so you pulled some alarms And did some hocus-pocus On some guards . I didn 't do it on purpose , jd . I can 't control it . Did you at least ditch your car ? Yeah . I tossed my phone . I took two buses to get here . Trust me , i was not followed . That doesn 't mean they stopped looking . The gsc has a virus to kill hybrids . And they 're gonna release it . I 'm gonna die . Hey . Don 't talk like that . You 're not gonna die on my watch , okay ? I promise . All right , come on . Did she say why she wanted the spores ? You know molly . Not much of a chatty cathy . She just started downloading onto that drive . Well , any information that could be detrimental ? It depends what she does with it . Like ... If she goes public , yes . Gsc 's gonna be looking for your car . As soon as shepherd figures it out , He 's gonna be looking for mine as well . But they won 't be looking for this . Is this yours ? A guy owes me a favor . Molly , What 's the plan ? Without the spores ... I saw you do a dna test With two paperclips and a bottle of iodine , all right ? If anybody can figure this out , it 's you . What i need is an exact gene pairing , And i can only get that from my son . The alien ? Yeah . I need his dna . And i know he 's here . Somewhere . All right , just so you know , I can 't plug " somewhere " into a gps . Okay . Well , when he showed up at my apartment , I knew that he was gonna be there before he got there , And somehow he knew that i was gonna be at that bar . So ... What if hybrids have some kind of psychic connection ? All right , that is a huge " what if , " molly . Well , he sent me a message , jd . I heard voices , And that has to mean something . I 'm hearing voices right now , too , And they 're telling me to put that tarp back on this car . ( scoffs ) you know , lots of species communicate without words . Bats , Ants , dolphins . I think what i need to do here Is just figure out how To find his signal . I guess we 're going for a ride . ( engine starts ) Male voice : Ignition activated . ( engine roaring ) Are you comfortable ? The upload 's gonna take a couple of hours . Let me show you what we 've developed . A.I. , open viewing port . A.I. : Opening viewing port . 100 humanichs physically ready . All they need is your neural algorithm . Lucy : Wait . My experiential upload is going into all of those humanichs ? When we first created the program , Each humanich was designed to be unique . Shaped by their own experiences . Like ethan . But with the alien threat , the plan changed . And you proved effective , so ... Well , will i still be me ? Will they all be me ? Their experiences will make them unique , but ... Their baseline is all Your algorithm , You . Lucky them . All right , you ready ? ( beep ) Neural paths activated . Upload commencing . ( electrical whirring ) ( indistinct chatter ) What did you find ? Sir , we 've gone deep into our systems . Jd richter seems to not exist . No phone records , No real estate purchases . His car doesn 't have a tracker . He 's gone mia . Look , he 's patrol special- - a cop- - They should be able to find him , no ? When his license was revoked , he must have Ditched the software . Richter : You know , we 've been driving around For a while . Are ... Are you getting anything- - any hint of a signal ? ( sighs ) no . Maybe i 'm ... I 'm doing it wrong . I don 't know . All right , what 's another way to send a message ? You got morse code , smoke signal ... Message in a bottle ? Or ... Graphene drive . Now , they sent me a message , so maybe I can send them one back . What 's that ? My files from the gsc . I found a message encoded in their dna . ( distorted whispering ) That 's it . This is information Encoded in the junk . They sent A message from their home planet . Listen . What does it say ? " help me . " I have this really cool game that we could play . Soon you 'll get to meet your sister . ( beep ) Julie : Ethan ? What you got there ? I 've been looking for you . Can we talk for a minute ? About what ? About what happened with molly . I know things must be really confusing , and I want you to know that i love you . And molly loves you , too . I 'm not sure what i 'm supposed to say . Say what you feel . You reprogrammed me not to feel . That 's not true . And i can restore your program back to what it was at any time . You can feel all those old feelings again- - Your memories of molly . If that 's what you want . And feel pain ? Sometimes pain is okay if it means you get to know the truth . I already know . Molly can 't take care of me . Unless that 's a lie , too . Why would she lie about that ? You lied . I guess that 's just what humans do , huh ? Can i take these pieces home ? I can use them to fix my old car . Then i 'll have two . Sure . Richter : All right , we 're here . This is the highest point within a 50-mile radius . ( distorted whispering ) You know , i don 't know biology , but i do know With radio frequencies , the higher the altitude , The less interference with the signal . Well , i just hope he 's listening . ( soft gasp ) All right , let me take a look at this . Come on , we 're friends . Drop trou . ( both chuckle ) Okay . Oh , molly . This is infected . We 're gonna have to clean that And redress it . Okay . Okay . I 'm gonna warn you : This is gonna sting . Oh , oh . Oh . I told you . Oh , god . Mm-hmm . You actually sound like you know what you 're talking about . D-minus in biology But an a-plus in combat triage . Okay . Well , i see you brought a lot Of second kuwait back with you . Radios , first aid . What else you got ? Nothing useful . Oh , g- - oh ... ( gunfire , men shouting ) Man : Incoming ! Jd ! You okay ? Yeah . I 'm okay . ( molly inhales , sighs ) Molly : Nothing 's happening . ( sighs ) Maybe it 's like doing a crossword puzzle . You know when you get stuck on a word , You look away And the answer just pops into your head ? You do crossword puzzles ? No . ( laughs ) So you were up there , huh ? 13 months . You know , i got my first telescope when i was seven . I was obsessed with that thing . I knew there had to be something else out there . Be careful what you wish for . What was it like ? Up there by yourself For so long ? It was better Than i ever thought it would be . I didn 't have to lie up there . I didn 't have to ... Pretend to be somebody that i wasn 't . I could just ... Be . I envy that . I wish i could just ... Be . Pretty sure i failed as a father . No . That 's how you see you . But that 's not how i see you . How do you see me ? I see ... A kind , Loving father . A gentleman . Wow . I think that 's the first time That anyone has ever used The word " gentleman " to describe me . Well ... That 's ' cause they don 't see you . But i do . And you 're still here . Yeah . But so are you . Yeah . ( aural fractals sound ) ( indistinct whispering ) What is it ? It 's ahdu . I know where he is . If you would 've told me two months ago That i 'd be following around an astronaut looking for aliens , I 'd have said you were nuts . Well , two months ago , i was nuts . We 've been walking around the middle of nowhere for hours . Are you sure about this ? Yeah . Hi . We 've been waiting for you . I thought we were looking for one guy . I wasn 't quite prepared for alien nation . Molly : I don 't think they 're gonna hurt you , So put that gun away . You don 't think ? You came . Welcome home . We only have a few minutes Before she comes back . ( laughs ) what 's the big secret ? Whoa . Ethan : This is spyder . He 's our baby brother . Wh ... What , you made him ? Impressive . And look . Lucy : It 's a camera . Wow . Spyder can keep his eyes and ears on humans When you 're offline . And guess what . I have enough for a few more spyders . Then our family will be even bigger . ( chuckles ) And we can keep an eye on everybody . You 're my real family , Lucy . I want to be a soldier like you . ( chuckles ) someday you will be . In the meantime , you build your army and i 'll build mine . Ahdu : We knew you 'd find us . Once you learned the truth . Well , it wasn 't easy . You know what 's happening to me , Don 't you ? You meeting me at that bar wasn 't an accident . You were drawn to me . We 're the same . No . We 're not the same . And i don 't want to be the same . Thank you , terra . You 're welcome , daddy . She 's your ... My daughter . Yes . We need to talk , ahdu . Privately . Hey . Are those your toys over there ? Yeah . Want to see ? Absolutely . I 'll be right over here . I need a sample of your dna . Your blood . It 's the only way i can figure out If i can reverse what 's happening To me . Why ? Why ? Because it 's not me . I 'm hearing voices in my head . I 'm having urges that aren 't me . I almost killed a man . Was he trying to hurt you ? That 's beside the point . But isn 't that what humans do ? React when they 're in danger ? Isn 't that what you 're doing right now ? Please . Ethan needs me . This is the only way . Very well . Aren 't you at all curious ? Why do you want to run from something You don 't yet understand ? I know what you are . I know what you 're doing . All those women . What is it you think i don 't understand ? Well , if you knew the truth , you wouldn 't be afraid . You would be amazed . Are you willing to learn ? This is the mommy , this is the daddy , And this is the baby . What 's mommy doing ? Is she sleeping ? No , she 's dead . ( aural fractals sound ) Voice ( whispering ) : Help me . Help me . Get away from her . Stop . ( indistinct whispering ) Molly . ( exhales ) You understand now . Yes . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry for your loss . His loss ? What about our loss ? What about those dead women ? It was never our intent to harm you . Richter : So much for good intentions . Molly , let 's get out of here . Ahdu : Wait . Can i show you something ? Please ? ( sighs ) ( elevator bell dings ) This is the one that i like , so if you could get that ... Anna . Can i talk to you a minute ? Is there a problem ? Uh , no , the upload 's complete . The humanichs Are under way . Well , then i would say we deserve a drink . Well , i-i don 't want a drink . I want answers . About john 's death . What are you talking about ? After he left humanichs that night , i called you And you told me not to worry and that you would handle it . And ... 20 minutes later , He was dead . Are you accusing me of murder ? Just tell me you didn 't do it . That we didn 't do it . Julie , that was an accident . A very convenient one . But still it was an accident . Our hands are clean . So stop with your conspiracy theories And get back to work . Accusations like that can have repercussions . Richter : So what is this ? It 's a memorial . To commemorate Every human life sacrificed to save us . We didn 't understand impregnating humans Would cause their death . We 're not here to kill , We 're here to survive . To rebuild . Sometimes " sorry " isn 't enough , and this is one of those times . We agree . The deaths are unforgivable . But we have managed to evolve . Evolve ? How ? We procreate without causing harm to humans . Hybrid births no longer kill the mothers . That 's why there hasn 't been any more reported deaths . Molly , we don 't know that that 's true . We don 't know what they want . Ahdu : We want to coexist . Peacefully . I told you you 'd have to make a choice . Now is that time . Richter : You can 't be serious , molly . They 're people , for god 's sakes . Peaceful people . We can 't let the gsc unleash a virus . That 's genocide . Okay , so ... So the hybrids live , and ... Then what ? We learn to coexist . What did he do to you ? What did he show you ? Their history . What about it ? They were a peaceful society On their planet , Threatened with extinction by a virus . Now , the spores were sent out To try to find a suitable host . That 's when they found me , On the seraphim . Molly , they can mess With your head , your perception . How do you know what he 's telling you is true ? Because i 'm one of them . No , you 're not . Yes . You saw the triple helix . No ! You are infected with their dna . Come on . We got what we came for . We got ahdu 's dna . Now let 's get out of here and take that back to the lab . No . What i 'm gonna do Is i 'm gonna explain this To shepherd . You 're officially certifiable . Look . Healed . I heal faster . I think faster . What we 're dealing with here , jd , Is evolution . Survival of the fittest . Now , what we ought to be doing Is studying them , not trying to kill ' em ! No , we are talking about aliens here , molly . Who are part human . And part not ! I don 't think you understand How dangerous this all is . I 'm sorry , jd , But i cannot be a part Of slaughtering innocent children With a virus i created . Now , if you do nothing And i do nothing , they are all gonna Die . Me included . Julie : What do you say we go get some pizza On our way home ? Sure , if you want . Why couldn 't lucy come ? Because i hardly ever see you And you like pizza . Lucy likes pizza , too . ( elevator bell dings ) ( sighs ) Otis : Floor , please . P2 parking , please . Thank you , otis . Otis , why are we going up ? We are not going up , julie . Yes , we are . We 're going in the wrong direction , otis . Stop . Stop , otis ! ( thud ) That was weird . Hold on , hold on ! Emergency override ! Stop ! Stop the elevator ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop , stop ! Have a good evening , julie , And a safe ride home . Are you okay ? ! Sure . These are african elephants . Want to know why ? Because the mom and dad ... ( indistinct conversations ) So what do you think ? I think we 've found our new leader . ( sobbing quietly )

 We want to speak with Dr Morrow . What is the nature of the work you do for Qualia ? They 're trying to kill us , to wipe us out . We must fight back . I 've got a seraph . 'You 've bonded yourself to it . ' The boundaries between what is considered synthetic and human have been blurred . My systems are operating at full capacity . " I 'm having difficulty finding purpose or meaning . " You can make any synth conscious . Has she told you ? Mattie has completed the code . She 's worked out how to wake us up . Where is it ? She must have hidden it . I don 't have anything . She 's lying . Mattie , it could be the key . If we could grow our consciousness , there could be ten of us tomorrow . In a few days , 100 . We 'd be strong , we could do anything . They 're being tortured , killed . Don 't you care ? You know I do . But you 're going to hurt someone . It is only go to make things worse . Humans made it worse . I can make her tell us . Hester , you 're not going to hurt her . Hester . Hester ! Aargh ! Let her go . What is she to you ? She 's the reason I am alive . Aargh ! Now ... Hester . If you do this , it will only make them hate you more , fear you more . It 's time for them to fear us . Tell me your plan . The silo is guarded around the clock . We capture someone with access and apply pressure . There 's a better way . This programme contains scenes of violence . What if we kept him ? He 's not real . What does that mean ? Who says I 'm real ? I do . You 've got a mind . He 's got programming . And you can tell the difference ? Drummond . Yeah . OK . OK , I 'll pop down now . One of the papers has run a piece on the cover-up of unusual synth malfunctions . It 's started . Won 't be long now . OK ? Sam , what is your primary function ? To bring my users happiness , to be a source of comfort and ease their pain . That was my function , too , once . You appear to be in mild emotional distress . What is the matter ? Pete 's right , you 're not the answer . Even if I do want to kiss you goodbye . Now , why do I want to do that , Sam ? It is human convention to do so at a moment of parting . But I 'm not human . You exhibit zero cardiorespiratory activity . I must conclude you are deceased . Please accept my condolences . I 'm not dead , I 'm synthetic , like you . Well , not like you . I feel . Where are you going ? To see a very clever lady I hope can help me . Don 't be scared . Pete will look after you . He 's a good man . The best . OK ? I know you 're just programmed to do that ... but thank you . Here , Soph . I found these . Only they go off tomorrow . So , I need to eat the whole bag today with someone who really , really likes them . Can you think of anyone who might ? These appear to be new , Joe . They don 't go off until next year . Yeah , I know , I 'm just mucking about . Are we going to eat them or what ? I do not require sustenance , thank you , Joe . Yoghurty . I 'm sorry I haven 't been around much . I 've been a bit busy . You 've been helping Niska . How is she now ? She doesn 't need my help any more . You mean she 's dead ? No , she 's ... not dead . She 's just gone away again . They always go away . I 'm going to break into that place . Someone is going to get hurt . OK . So , we call the police . No . You know what happens to me if we do that . What about Max ? He left . I can try and find him . Yeah . And I 'll keep looking for Niska . If they don 't listen to Max , they 'll certainly listen to her . OK . I know who can help me find her . No . There 's no legal protection for them . We 're the only ones that can help them . Or maybe you don 't care . I care about us . You , me , the kids , that 's what I care about . " Mattie . " " I don 't know how to live with myself . " " I don 't know how to help others as I am now . " " I long for the past . " " I felt nothing then " " but I had a purpose . " " A place in the world . " " Thank you for a glimpse into another life . " " It is a great gift . " " But I cannot accept it . " " Goodbye . " " Odi . " Odi , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Hello . I am now in setup mode . 'I can hear you thinking . 'If you tell me , I can help . ' That Veronica synth that we found , the one that Leo Elster contacted , she gave us a number , and we tracked it . Leo changes phones , he moves around a lot . The last reading , three days ago ... was here . That 's ten miles from where we are right now . So , it could be a coincidence or he is on his way here . If I know Leo , he probably is . It 's Sunday . This building isn 't ... open for visitors . How did you get in ? I insisted . You know Leo Elster ? I know a lot more than that . I know Qualia are collecting synths that have become spontaneously sentient . I also know they 're building illegal synth prototypes that are styled as children . My guess is Milo Khoury hired you to learn from the former and apply it to the latter . You 're figuring out how to transfer digital consciousness from one platform to another . Who are you , Detective Voss ? That 's for reading the serial number on a synthetic iris . Who are you ? Look up a picture of Beatrice Elster . David 's late wife . He made you to replace her ? And you 're conscious ? What do you want ? What 's the matter ? This is where you hurt us . Is this the end ? No . No . Don 't be frightened . Aveling ? 'We 've got one . Security guard at the warehouse called the council . 'There 's a Synth acting strangely on his roof . ' Hello ? Hello ? We 're here to help . We know the nature of your ... I know this one . She was brought to us before . Her scan showed up negative . Well , looks pretty positive now . Take ' em back , please , Steve . We don 't need that . You 're asking for a broken arm . Hi . Your name 's Mia , isn 't it ? We 're here to help you , Mia . But your behaviour is erratic and we 've got to power you down . Will you let me ? What 's happening to me ? What is it ? Her power mechanism seemed loose when I turned her off . Like someone 's tampered with it . That 'll be a case of one careful owner . Long as it works . Blue team are bringing another one in . Two in one morning - that 's a first . Shall I call Shine ? No , you can handle it . I 'm staying with this one . There 's something different about her . What if ... it 's all real ? Everything we 've done to them . Mrs Hawkins . Hi . I ran the name you gave me . You were right . She 's still in the UK .. You know I have to ask what this is about ? You helped us before , but if I tell you , you 're going to have to report it and we both know how that ends up for them . I 'm just trying to stop something bad from hap ... I 'm just trying to stop something bad from happening . What , bad for them or bad for us ? Pretty soon , that 's going to be the same thing . They get upset , scared , angry , and they can be dangerous , but they ... they also love . They can be loved .. You don 't need to tell me . I can upload you . That 's straightforward enough . Copy your mind onto the Qualia server . Is that what you really want ? I may never be able to make you human . I don 't want to wear a dead woman 's face any more . I don 't want this body . I can 't eat , can 't dream , can 't bear a child , can 't die . You want to die ? When the time comes . Or I 'll never know how human I really am . Not when I 'm still inside a machine . I 'm ready . Why do you think your family are worried about you ? They think it 's mad to want to be like a Synth , but really , it 's mad to want to be normal . Why ? Because Synths are perfect and clean . They don 't make mistakes . That 's what life should be like . I think you 're correct . And you don 't have to feel anything any more . You don 't have to worry about stuff , like your family . And you don 't have to miss people . And you don 't have to be sad . It 's really hard to stop all those feelings , but then I see you . I 'm going to be just like you . Hey , Renie ! I feel sorry for that ballet teacher . I left Soph charging in the corner - she refused to do her Arabesque until she was at 50 % . Dad , I think Renie might be doing something stupid . Renie ! She 's left her phone ! Renie ! Renie ! Renie , it 's cool . It 's me . You explain to her , yeah ? I 'll be downstairs having a coronary event . It 's nice to see you ... as you . Was it what Sophie said ? Nothing 's wrong with being a Synth . It was cool at the start . I could ... you know , control everything and I ... felt like I couldn 't get out . It was fun ... but ... you can get lost in it . Renie , do you want to come over to ours to eat ? They 're not planning on taking Niska in operational , as they put it . OK . Whatever . I haven 't seen her . So after everything that happened with Niska , instead of going home to Berlin , you came to Folkestone . I like the sea . Me too . Might go for a paddle later . Which way is it ? Her family are in trouble . They need her , or they may get hurt . Traitor . What trouble ? Qualia are taking Synths in as they become conscious . Leo and me are going to try and break them out . No way it turns out good for any of us . That 's their choice . You 're not going to try and stop them ? Niska , I know we failed , but you can still make a difference . My father made me . He knew exactly what I was , how far my mind could range , how deeply I could feel , and even so , he used me for his pleasure . If even my creator could choose to see me as a mere machine when it suited him , what choice do we have with the rest of humanity ? I tried to be selfless . I accomplished nothing . Now I have something worth having . Who told you they weren 't bringing me in operational ? Neha Patel . It was a trick to lead them to me . God ! Astrid , come on - we need to leave . There 's no time - come on . I 'm sorry . God ! Hello ? Hello ? Matilda , I 'm so pleased to meet you . Using our search systems to find us was ingenious . But , we may have to be more careful now that there are more of us . More of you ? This is Hubert . We found him four days ago . And Connie , who joined us yesterday . It 's Leo , isn 't it ? I somehow hoped he 'd turn back . It 's Hesta . She 's not right . It 's not her fault , but ... they 're not good for each other . He 'll listen to you . That was true once . My responsibilities are here now , with Flash . And Hubert and Connie , and all of us Synths that wake every day . We 're building our home here . Please . He 's not lost yet . Look after the others . But I only know how to make cheese sandwiches and tend to grazed knees and make pictures and play , and ... Then you know all you need to know . I apologise . I was unable to override the impulse to perform this inappropriate action . It 's all right . Hey , Mum . Hey . Heard from Max ? She found Max . She 's OK . And Niska ? She doesn 't want to help . She 's gone . So it 's still not over . No , it 's still not over . They 've put something in my head . Mine too , probably a tracker . We should move quickly , they can 't be far . K ? Thank Christ ! What shall I thank him for ? No , I shouldn 't have said that . Where is she ? Karen 's left five hours and 58 minutes ago . Where did she go ? I don 't know . Did she say anything else ? That you would look after me if she didn 't come back . And that a very clever lady would be helping her . Will you look after me if Karen doesn 't return ? Of course . Don 't , um , open the door to strangers , right ? Good lad . Where 's the one we brought in this morning ? Sent her down to storage with the other newbie . Here ... They cocked it up , though . They 've got her down as 15 years old . That would be a record . Are you OK ? Elster 's prototypes . Morrow 's briefing said they 'd be between eight and 15 years old . We are here to liberate you . Everything will be OK . Help us . Don 't be afraid . I 'm like you . Don 't worry . We 're going to set you free . Follow us . We 're going to take you somewhere safe . Please ... no more pain . No-one will ever hurt you again . You and us , we 're the same . We 're trapped . Do you know my owner , Malcolm ? Will I ever see him again ? He needs my help . Right now , I need your help . Stop ! This way . We 're leaving . Don 't try to stop us . The upload is under way . It 's Dr Aveling , she has called three times . I will check it 's safe , then we move . You did it . You two go . Lead them to safety . I must go back . Why ? They will simply start again tomorrow unless we find those in charge and stop them . You mean to kill them ? We 've done it . If we do not take action now , while we have the chance , we betray every synth they are yet to capture . It 's all right . I do what you know must be done but cannot do yourself . Our prisoner , the woman who shot Ten ... I didn 't know . Why are you lying ? You knew . Hester ... They must be stopped . I will not betray our kind . Hester , no . They need you . I 'll deal with her . Mia , be careful . There 's transport half a kilometre up the hill . Come on . It 's OK , you can trust me . 'Lock down . Perimeter secure . ' What 's happening ? Lock down procedure . Wait ! No , no , no ! Stop ! Stop ! The alarm was triggered from Special Projects . They don 't know what 's going on yet . The police are on their way . Who is the most senior person in Qualia 's synthetic programme ? Perhaps it 's you ? We need to get this door opened . I 'm going to call security again . Hi . What 's happening here ? The whole building 's on lockdown . Did you see anything on your way up ? No , nothing . There 's no-one here . What are you doing here , Pete ? I 'm here to take you home , aren 't I ? Athena Morrow ! Come out here and this woman will go unharmed . Or she dies . Please , don 't let her do this to me , please , please ... All right . Let 's take a moment here . What do you want with Dr Morrow ? To kill her . Why would you want to do that ? Qualia imprisons us . Tortures us . Kills us . OK . You 're angry . But we can talk . We can talk this out , without anybody getting hurt . What about those she has already hurt ? Those that are dead ? Hurting the people that did it won 't bring them back . Look , the doors are all locked . We can 't open them . The whole building is . Now , my name 's Pete . I 'm a police officer . What 's your name ? Designations have no relevance . OK . But I would like to know what to call you . Hester . Hester . Well , here 's my plan . You let ... What 's your name , love ? Helen . You let Helen go , and then you talk to Dr Morrow . Athena . You explain what you think needs to change . And she 'll listen . I don 't need to speak to her . I just need to kill her . Hester ... You know when we 're lying . You see her , in there ? She 's like you . Conscious synthetic . A few years older . No offence , K ! I can 't lie to her . I wouldn 't anyway , because I love her . Now , if you let Helen go , I will make sure Athena hears you out . And no-one hurts you or takes you away . Am I telling the truth ? Yes . Why are you here ? I want to become human . You wish to be less than you are ? It isn 't a question of less or more . Only what feels right . I should do what feels right . Such fear . Door . V , I need you to open the door in lab one . When we 've been hunted , imprisoned , tortured , killed ... When we know our existence is worthless to all but a few humans out of billions ... When we have one chance to strike back , to defend ourselves ... All we can do is what feels right . No ! No , no ! Pete ! He may still live . Open the door . I would if I could . Hester . The door , V. Call an ambulance ! Pete ? Pete ? Are you with me ? Yes ... Leo ... Leo . It 's all right . I 'm here . Come on . Safe now . There 's a truck in the lay-by on the other side of the woods . Take them there . Go with them . Come on , we have to go . Mia . Help is on the way . I 'm ... finding it ... hard to breathe . You 're bleeding into your chest cavity . You 'll need surgery soon , but you 'll be fine . You used to be a good liar . You wanted her to ... Make me human . Can she do that ? Theoretically . Where ... would you have gone ? Home to you . Where else would I go ? You can ... You can ... I didn 't know . Go . Before the police come . Subtitles by Ericsson

 ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) - BECKY : Good morning , David ! - Hi , Jamie . - It 's Becky . - Becky . I 'm so sorry . BECKY : That 's okay . What 's up ? You get any sleep last night ? DAVID : I feel like shit . RENY : Me , too , man . I think I 'm still drunk . I think I might shit my pants , too . Oh , make sure you do that during the presentation . Mmm-hmm . - Can I have a moment ? - Sorry , princess . - You 're late . Let 's go . - I know . - I redid the layout . - Why ? The layout was perfect . You 're really throwing that word around a lot lately . Hollis , why aren 't you this funny when you 're writing copy ? HOLLIS : I 'm pretty sure you 're only allowed to tell me how to do my job if you show up on time . That 's like a privilege , not a right . SCOTT : It 's ten after . DAVID : I 'm really sorry . You don 't need your phone . - How do I , uh ... - ( DAVID CLEARS THROAT ) - Eyes , connect to overhead . - ( CHIMING ) - Oh , you 're a fucking genius . - No , I 'm just younger than you . Is my hand shaking ? - I can 't find anything . - It 's in your hand . You just pinch the one that you want . Oh , cool . Oh , I 'm like an ... I 'm like an old wino . I don 't know why I do this to myself . - Because you 're running in fear . - Reny . Quiet . I 'm gonna puke on you , David . Button your top button . Showtime . Don 't fuck this up . - JULIETTE : Inhale . And exhale . - ( CLASS EXHALES ) And right leg into the sky . Stretch it up . And now , bending at the knee , stacking the hips . Stretching it out again up to the sky . Now bring it through and between your hands . Now interlace your hands behind your back and come up to a high lunge . We 're expanding our awareness , yes ? Now bringing your back foot to the ground , arms overhead . Warrior One . Make sure that your hips are facing the front of the room . If you have to widen your stance a little bit , that 's fine , but make sure your back foot is in total contact . Billy , your foot isn 't in contact . There you go . At any given moment , there are a million things vying for our attention . That 's better . Do you feel that ? So , where do we let our attention fall ? Warrior Two . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING ) ( CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ) Good , good . A little more sex , please . All right , scream , girls . Bigger than feels natural . Big , big , big , big ! More sex . Yeah , we got it , we got it . We got it . BOBBY : How old are these girls , Wim ? - They have pimples . - ( SCOFFS ) - Are we going back to charcoal number two ? - I don 't know . What do you think ? Oh . Well , I don 't really notice a difference . I know . Me , too . Well , we were saying , " Why not get both , " right ? So we have the option ? No , but what he 's saying is that there 's no difference between the two . Like , on camera . Right , Wim ? - WIM : Hey . Taking a break ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? What 's your name again ? - Casey . Casey . Okay , so , Casey , your shit 's not really working , is it ? - So , let 's change it up . - What ? And you 're fucked up on mimosas , or something ? So , that 's a problem . Excuse me ? I 'm saying don 't show up to work for me fucked up . - Ever . - ( SCOFFS ) Shit barely works as it is . Barely works . Let 's try it again . Yeti , loving you . Loving what you 're doing . - Damsel , damn . Casey ! - ( CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ) Look at you , Case , you big slugger , stepping to that plate ! Yeah ! Okay , that 's great . You 're giving Bobb-o a boner over here . - BOBBY : Total boner , ladies . - Oh , hold that , hold that . Got it . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) GABE : When I started this company , I had a vision that we could enhance real life with a magical layer in front of it . In order to pull off that technology , it has to be fully immersive . And to be immersive , it has to be seamless . The problem with the existing technologies and what we 've worked so hard to innovate past is that it doesn 't actually seem real . In my opinion , Augmenta is the first , actually convincing , augmented reality system . Your competition , at this point , is basically a household name . More than household , it 's ubiquitous . Yeah . And that name signifies something that 's new , that works , that people better know about . And Augmenta means ... What the fuck is Augmenta ? Well , we have the only open-source AR operating system that 's not insignificant . DAVID : Totally true , and I really like it . But I don 't know how we market that . Let 's talk about what your competitor does . They sell distraction . It 's lightsabers , it 's AR drinking games ... It 's , uh , picking up chicks with a face scanner . Or , like , sentimental crap . Transatlantic father-son guitar lessons . And they 're playing Hey Jude , which is , I mean , come on ... Yeah , it 's nerdy . And maybe they know that and maybe they don 't . But either way , they don 't care and they 're not concerned because they know that they have built-in market recognition and they know that they 're reliable on the OS end . - They 're not . - DAVID : But the sad reality is , you 've got a boner for the newest face-computer . What are you gonna do ? You 're gonna buy it from the establishment . Okay , so that 's the problem . How do we address it ? SCOTT : Let 's change the whole conversation . Instead of talking about what the technology can do for you , let 's talk about what you can do with the technology . We feel really strongly about this . Augmenta is not Main Street . It 's Bedford Avenue . David . What does that mean in reality ? In reality it means they 're all out there masturbating . We 're here actually fucking . Yeah . Augmenta is not a toy . It 's an extremely powerful , creative tool . So , this is our approach . We give a pair to a genius-level creative . We let them play around with it , we see what comes back . We might have a new art form on our hands . Not that we care about art . We give a shit about selling your magic glasses , though . Okay , so if not some nerd , then who ? Somebody worth learning about . ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( ALL CHUCKLE ) So , there 's an opportunity here to engage people 's imaginations . Put them in the role of creator , rather than just consumer . The great thing about going with Reggie is there 's so many different sides to him . It 's music , technology , a philosophy , comedy , totally on trend . Philosophy is on trend ? I mean , Reggie 's a wizard . He 's gonna come up with ideas for the interface you guys never even thought of . LUCY : What do you think ? It 's super interesting . Go get the champagne . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( RETCHING ) ( CELL PHONE BEEPING ) - Here you go , your very own pair . - Wow , thanks . - They want us to get real intimate with them . - Okay . What 's the matter with you ? You were amazing in there . You should be doing a victory lap around the office , high on cocaine . Those guys are just a little intense . - Yeah , well , big leagues , big money . - Right . - Okay ? - Yes . All right , I need you to get me treatments on all the fucking bells and whistles on this thing , okay ? - No problem . - All the top apps . And I need it tonight . Okay . - You got that ? Beautiful . - Yeah . Shit , what about Phalinex ? Oh . Uh ... Fuck Phalinex , all right ? Do this first . I hate Phalinex . I hate it . It 'll be the last pharma stuff you 'll ever have to do , okay ? I promise . You said that last time . Look , I know you 're dying to hack these glasses , okay ? So , just get me the copy , make sure I see it before it goes out , and make sure you fry it . I 've got a great idea . Why don 't you write the copy , since you write for a for a 7th grade level naturally ? Okay . I gotta go or I 'm gonna get divorced , all right ? You were incredible in there , okay ? Superlative . Exemplary . Give me a pound , let 's blow up this rock . Scott , you 're the worst . ( MIMICS EXPLOSION ) - You 're my favorite customer . - Mmm . Honk . - I hate you . - I love you . ( HORNS BLARING ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Welcome , David . ( LAUGHING ) Hey . DAVID : What are you doing here ? - Can you watch this stuff for a second ? - Sure . ( SOPHIE SIGHS ) - Thanks . - Okay . - You have another one of those ? - Yeah . Thank you . - Thanks . Walk with me . - Okay . Hey , maybe don 't , uh , tell Juliette I was smoking . - Not that it would come up , I just ... - Oh , no , no problem . DAVID : So , what 's with the bags ? You 're delivering drugs now , or what 's going on ? No , returns . For this job I 'm on , and they keep bitching about cab fare , so now I 'm schlepping it all over the place . That sucks . Yeah , I hate this job , but ... AUTOMATED VOICE : Scan complete . - ( SIGHS ) Things are really slow right now . - Yeah . When did you get glasses ? Oh , no , I 'm just mildly near-sighted . Weren 't you doing a thing with African prints ? Yeah , but we 're barely breaking even and I want to get my own studio . I 'm just really ... I 'm like really terrible with money . - Oh . - Yeah . Would you ever want to do something at Homunculus ? I mean , the people are the absolute worst , but the money 's actually really good . - Seriously ? - Yeah . I can throw your hat in the ring . Oh . Shit . You know what , that would be amazing . Thank you . Cool . Yeah , no problem . ( SIGHS ) So , why don 't you , uh , move in with Wim if money 's an issue ? - Why do you say that ? - No , I just mean you would save on rent . I don 't know . I guess I just never thought of myself as the kind of girlfriend who was always like hanging around . Right . I mean , you like living with Juliette . I didn 't mean ... You know , it 's weird . You would think when you live with somebody you would get to know them really well . But I feel like I 've just become more acutely aware of how I don 't know her at all . You know what I mean ? ( VEHICLE BEEPING ) Hmm ... No , I don 't . Those sound like real grown-up problems to me . Well , you 're a grown-up now . What are you , 18 ? - Did you get this bike for graduation ? - ( CHUCKLES ) How did you know ? - So , where you headed to now ? - ( SCOFFS ) Midtown . Emotional Afghanistan . Yeah . Um ... Okay , I got to go . But were you serious about that job at your agency ? Yeah . Or I could get you a job , uh , working for the mob . That works , too . I mean , I don 't know how much , uh , experience ... You don 't need any training . It 's actually , if you 're a drug addict , - they just hire you right away . - Then , I 'm perfect for this job . - Well , nice to see you . - Thank you . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , see you later . - Thanks for the smoke . - Yeah . Yeah , no problem . Stay hip . - REBECCA : Sort of like short vignettes . - ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) - Very tonal . - Mmm , yes . Just like music with gorgeous shots of models . - At the beach , or in the woods , or something . - PRODUCER : Or a carnival . REBECCA : Oh , my God , what about in a mental hospital ? PRODUCER : Yeah . Oh , yes . REBECCA : Oh , my God , I can picture it . - I think that 's fabulous . - The girl is half-naked . REBECCA : Oh , my God , and we could do a video . - Don 't you think ? - PRODUCER : I think it 's a great idea . - REBECCA : What do you think ? - Yeah . Yeah . Fuck it , let 's do a video . Sounds great . REBECCA : Yeah . A video will be amazing , let 's do it . - I said yes , Rebecca . I 'm for it . - REBECCA : Oh , my God , I love it . ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) Jesus Christ . Look at what Wim just sent me . - Oh . Who 's that ? - Some model . Someone he 's working with ? - More like a hobby , I think . - Oh , that 's classy . ( SPITS ) He always was . - Somebody 's been smoking . - No . - I feel really bad for Sophie . - Why ? Well , he acts like she 's cool with it , but I think she has no idea . - Do you think she 's seeing other people ? - Nah . Why ? Well , I don 't know . Does it seem like that to you ? I don 't know , they 're your friends . Why are you so worried about it anyways ? - I 'm not worried about it . - Do you have a crush on Sophie ? ( SCOFFS ) Give me a break . Sophie 's like my little sister . ( MOCKING ) " Sophie 's like my little sister . " Really ? Wim used to act guilty about it , at least . Now if I think it 's weird , he acts like I don 't get how life works . How much do you think it costs to lease an electric car ? Depends on what kind . I don 't know , just something small that runs . That way we can go Upstate on the weekends . You 're going Upstate tomorrow . - I know , but this way you can come with me . - Nah . - Really ? That 's your answer ? - What ? - Are you drunk ? - You can tell I wanna have sex , right ? Um ... - Sort of . - But you 're ignoring me for some reason ? No . You just started and now you 're over there and you stopped . - ' Cause you weren 't into it . - Into what ? Sex with me , sweetheart . - Okay , stop yelling . - I 'm not yelling . You grabbed my breast for like 15 seconds and now - you 're sitting over there yelling at me . - Yeah . - You 're drunk . - Because you were ignoring me . - Okay , David , just stop shouting . - ( EXHALES ) You 're having , like , a little temper tantrum that has absolutely nothing to do with me . It 's because you 're drunk . And you 're looking at pictures - of , like , chicks ' asses , and Sophie . - I was talking about Wim . I was talking about my relationship with Wim . And then you want me to like , what ? I don 't know . - Spread my legs for you and like , hump you ? - Okay , back up . - I don 't know what you want . - We 're supposed to want to have sex . Right ? Okay . I 'll tell you what . Next time you come in here , - and you grab my breast like a little baby ... - ( SCOFFS ) Forget it . And then you whine about it like a littler baby , then I 'll know what you really want to do is just have sex with me . DAVID : Why don 't you fuck that ? - Be better than you right now . - That 's hilarious . I always used to say to myself , " I want a funny girlfriend . " ( MUSIC PLAYING ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Augmented Reality Beta 3 . Render complete . ( SOPHIE MOANING ) - I 'm gonna take a picture . - Okay . - I 'm gonna miss the train . - He said five minutes . - I don 't wanna go . - Oh , you always feel this way . Then you end up having a great time . You 're gonna meet new students , they 're gonna love you . You 're establishing your brand . - You just want me to go . - I do not . I hate being away from you . I never get used to it . ( CAR APPROACHES ) All right . Stay out of trouble . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Hey . - Thanks . - Love you . - I love you . Have fun . ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) WIM : Come in ! - Hi . - Put it away . What ? - Hi , David . - Hi . - Bye , babe . - Bye , sweetie . I feel like I interrupted something . No , not at all . She 's just going to work . She 's a working girl . Ciao , Guido . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Choose any bed you want . Oh , sorry , I requested a single . - Oh . Really ? - Yeah . See , we 're actually all booked up this weekend , so we had to move the sleeping charts around . But I 'll see what I can do . Sorry I said anything . This is fine . I 'll see if I can move some of the students in here . I 'm sorry I brought it up . Juliette , it 's really not a big deal . We 're so excited to have you here . I 'll see what I can do , okay ? Thank you . - First yoga class is at 5 : 00 , okay ? - Great . - ( LAUGHS ) I 'll leave you to relax for a bit . - Okay . Thank you . ( SIGHS ) Fucking hippies . - The interface is sick . - I know . It 's gonna be weird when we all have chips in our brain . No . It won 't seem weird then . It 'll seem inevitable . The people who don 't do it will be the weird ones . It 'll be like the Amish . And we 'll all be like , " I almost envy their simplicity . " What 's this , uh ... What 's the password for this thing ? What is this ? - Nope . - Give me the password . - Nope . - Cock tease . I haven 't perfected it yet . Because you 're a man of perfection , aren 't you ? - Ow ! Fuck . ( LAUGHING ) - Did you hurt yourself ? Oh ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . - What 's your password ? - ( LAUGHS ) GOVINDAS : Hi . Hi . - I 'm Govindas . - We 've met . I like to keep it casual up here , so I thought it 'd be nice if we taught together and taught a couple of poses at a time . That seems kind of awkward . Maybe you should just take this class and I 'll take the next one . Mmm . No , it 'll be great . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Great , so right hand on the hip , spin the chest open , lift your toes , and then from your feet go ahead and send the right arm up . And from your back , too , all right ? Press the heels and see if , from your feet and from your back , you can send the arm up . And open the right hand , and then your back will make a little more space for your lungs , right ? For your face . See if you can relax while getting a little bit bigger . Yeah ? Great . Beautiful . Keep the breath nice and long . And actually , if you let your butt stick out a little bit while keeping your tailbone in , then you naturally create more space in your back . And then if you twist your front foot out towards the back of the room , then your back can come in and you 've added integrity to the pose as well . Great . DAVID : Ugh . The ones from New Hampshire are fucking terrible . Holy shit . It 's El-P . Oh , shit . Jaime . - What 's going on , man ? How are you ? - Hey . I 'm so sorry about what happened with that editorial . - It was totally out of my hands . - Oh . Yeah , yeah , yeah . He 's , uh , he 's apologizing . - I had no idea they were gonna do that , man . - Yeah . No . Thanks ... - Thanks for the apology , man . Thanks . - Jaime . - No , no , it 's cool . - Jaime . - Jaime . - Stop saying my name , man . Kind of a grump . ( LAUGHS ) - What 's going on with that model ? - Model ? Oh , shit , yeah . - You , uh ... You can keep a secret , right ? - Nope . Who am I gonna tell ? Let 's think about that for a second , David . Who in the world might you tell ? - No , I won 't . - Your special soul mate , maybe ? - Might run it by her ? - I won 't . Holy shit . You live in a movie . I know . I do live in a movie and it 's great . What if , uh ... What if Sophie saw that ? Hey , you don 't let Juliette look at your phone , do you ? No . - David ? - No . - ' Cause you can 't do that , that 's not healthy . - I know . Seriously , like triple-encrypt that shit . You can 't ... That 's yours . - Okay . - ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) Oh ! Would you like to go to a party ? - Yes , I would . - Yeah . ( SNORTING ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) - DAVID : Do you know Michael Caine ? - Who ? Michael Caine .

So , how 's it going ? ( JULIETTE MUMBLES ) - Well , it 's kind of weird here . - Oh , yeah ? Like , how ? How ? Govindas is in the hot tub naked with two students . Hey , you 're kind of breaking up . I just , I don 't know why , I just want to come home . I can 't really hear you , sweetheart . It 's real loud there . Yeah , I mean , it 's a club . It sounds like you 're having a great time . Uh , listen , sweetheart , maybe I could call you back in a little bit ? Great . Great . I hope you have a great time . Hello ? ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Sweetheart ! Hi . - ( JULIETTE GIGGLES ) - Mmm . Wow . Hi . I 'm gonna stop drinking . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) - Don 't you have a 9 : 00 a.m. ? - ( GROANS ) David . Sorry . - I love you . - I love you . Hmm . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : All right , uh , - so camera should cut as well then ? - DIRECTOR : Yeah . WOMAN : Is that something we can get for today ? - David ? Another camera ? - WOMAN : Yeah , just for some options . This is in addition to the three cameras we already have . Well , now we were thinking that we could have one always rolling , and that way we could get rehearsals , and whatever happens between takes . - Yeah , I think it 's a great idea . - Make it more natural . Four cameras . More natural . Got it . - This is happening . Right now . Right , David ? - Yes , it is . Okay , is anybody not ready ? All right , great , then let 's roll camera . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : Here we go . And , action ! PILOT : Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : And , cut . ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) I can 't , I can 't even hear the name of the product , okay ? - Phalinex . - SCOTT : Okay . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : I thought that was a lot better . Great . But just really , we gotta emphasize Phalinex . Okay . Okay . Hey , Mike , that was great . You just really want to make sure that you emphasize the word Phalinex . PILOT : Phalinex . Okay . And let 's roll , please . We 're already rolling . To capture the magic between takes , right ? ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : Okay , is anybody not ready ? Here we go . This is the one , this is the take . Everybody , quiet , please . And , action . PILOT : Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . DIRECTOR : Cut . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : Cut . I don 't think it 's clear that it 's back in the chair . He 's got to stress the word " back . " SCOTT : All right , so " Phalinex , " big punch , also " back , " a big punch . - Mike . - PILOT : Yes ? That was great . Let 's just make sure to punch both " Phalinex " and the word " back , " please . Yeah , it 's like a one-two punch . It 's like Phalinex put me back ! ( GRUNTING ) Boxing . And , action . PILOT : Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : That was great , Mike , you 're getting there . Okay , I 'm sorry , I 'm just confused . How are we supposed to know that he 's a pilot ? He 's wearing a pilot 's outfit and he 's in a cockpit . Well , I 'm not buying it . Hit the word " pilot " harder so that I can hear it . He could say , " I 'm a pilot , " at the beginning . - Is the other camera here ? - It 's coming , it 's on its way . Okay , Scott , I don 't know . Maybe it 's a costume thing , - but I 'm not seeing a pilot . - Okay , we 'll fix it . I just ... I don 't understand why you have to make ... Listen , you 're not paying ... Okay . He looks like an MTA employee ! I need him to look like a pilot . - I don 't see why that 's difficult . - Absolutely . - No . You know what I think might work ... - ( SIGHS ) ... is I have this really great vintage bomber 's jacket . Do you wanna slip this on real quick ? Um ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) He could be , like , a really cool , edgy pilot who wears his own jacket over his uniform . Let me see this . - I like it , let 's get that shot . - I think this is gonna really work . Can I get you anything ? WOMAN : Yes ! I would love a goat milk caramel latte , please . No foam . DIRECTOR : That looks great . You look awesome . ( CHUCKLES ) WOMAN : Has he gained weight since casting ? - ( WHISPERING ) Glad you 're here . - ( WHISPERING ) No problem . ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : And , action ! PILOT : Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . - DIRECTOR : Cut . - ASSISTANT DIRECTOR : Cut . It 's still not working . It 's not the jacket , it 's him . He 's not very good . - He 's not taking the direction at all . - ( SCREAMS ) Go fuck yourself , lady ! Emphasis on " fuck ! " ( SOBBING ) I 'm not a fucking Muppet ! I 'll go talk to him . Yeah , tell him he 's doing a great job . This is tough stuff . Fuck ! Fuck ! ( EXHALES ) Hi , Gary . Hey , hey . I know . I 'm late . Yeah , yeah . Um ... It 's okay , though , Govindas has got it , so , we 're good . - It won 't happen again . - Right . No , I 'm really sorry . I 'm just , I 'm kind of going through a weird transition right now , and Mercury 's in retrograde , so . Yeah , I know . Hey , um , listen , Juliette , I 'm thinking maybe Govindas takes this slot from this point forward . I think that 's the right move . - But those are my students . - Well , technically , no . No , yeah . I 've been building this class for like a year , Gary . Right . But it 's like this , okay . - It 's like when an instructor comes on time ... - Mmm-hmm . ... and draws a lot of students here , then we help more people and make more money . You get that , right ? Right . You know that he fucks his students , right ? Um ... Yeah , I mean ... I ... Yeah . Like , here , in the sauna . - Really ? In the sauna ? - Yeah . Is that what you want me to do ? Do you want me to fuck my students in the sauna ? If it would help you get here on time , I would say , yes . Yeah , I guess . Right ? - Wow . You know what , you 're an asshole . - Like ... I 'm not saying ... No , no , no , I quit . Fuck you . - I 'm not saying fuck people in the ... - Fuck you . In the sauna . ( DOOR SLAMS ) ( REGGIE VOCALIZING ) So , stack them oh , so neatly in a row We want to be here now And don 't forget your glasses , too REGGIE : Let 's eat . ( DISHES CLATTERING ) - Can I get real with you guys ? - DAVID : Please . Do any of you know what Augmenta is ? LUCY : Well , yeah , it 's , it 's our product . - Okay . Wrong answers . - ( CHUCKLES ) Magic . Magic is what Augmenta is . Making people believe . Not forcing them , but making them believe that this is something so easy to use , that they 've been using it all their lives , even though they know , consciously , that they have never used this product before . That 's magic . This is why we think that you 're perfect for this campaign . We showed some of your videos to Margie and she was just dying . Yes . That 's what I 'm talking about . Yeah , and we were thinking , you know , it 'd be great if you could get some behind-the-scenes with Corden . You know , hanging out with him ... DAVID : Reggie , I think we all agree that we want it to be the authentic Reggie Watts experience and how you interface with Augmenta organically . The last thing we want it to be is contrived , right ? Yeah . We want the real deal and we want the real Reggie . That 's exactly right . That 's why I was so excited when I heard from Alicia , that this was even considered to be a possibility . I was so jazzed about it because it 's hard to find a situation where you 're working on this level but are still allowed full artistic , you know , expression . Okay , well , you know that it 's a mainstream product . Gabe , will you shut the fuck up ! You got Reggie and David handling this . You got everything under control . You have the two top guys in the business , and you 're fucking bitching like a bitch . - ( CHUCKLES ) - Let 's enjoy ourselves , okay ? You got a $ 100 piece of Jambon heading your way . Chill the fuck out , enjoy your life , for fuck 's sake ! - Come on , wieners ! - ( GLASSES CLINKING ) Can we get a couple more of these Chateauneuf-du-Papes ? ( LAUGHING ) ( ALL LAUGH ) - She 's kind of boring to me . You know ? - Mmm . Mmm . - You 're jealous of her . - Well , no . - No ? Yeah , I think you 're jealous of her . - I mean , absolutely ... - Hey , guys . - Hi . - Hey . What 's up ? Hey . - Hi . - Sophie ? - Yes . - Hey . This . - What is that ? - This is Green Dragon . - Uh-huh . And it will Augmenta your experience . - You guys into it ? - Holy moly . All right . Okay , just a little bit here . One , two , three , four , five , eight , ten . Wow . ( CHUCKLES ) - And one , two , three , four ... - Is that the correct dose ? - Okay . - I 'm a small person . Yep . - Cheers . - Goodbye . Goodbye . It 's been nice knowing you . Do you see how the mind is receiving consciousness , rather than creating it ? It 's as if the brain is an operating system . And built in to that operating system are a series of glitches . Yeah . REGGIE : If you think of life as a closed system , and you divide a line and then shift it , then you 've got a spiral . And we 're afraid of spirals . Definitely more comfortable with loops . 'Cause you know where you 're gonna end up . You know ? ( CHUCKLES ) What does that mean ? ( LAUGHING ) REGGIE : You get it . DAVID : I totally get it now . Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . Lightweight . ( EXHALES ) I never knew you were so cool . - Yeah . It grows , right ? - Yeah . - Like bacteria . - Mmm-hmm . - Switch . - Switch . Thanks . So , you 're near-sighted , huh ? ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Have you been recording me the whole time ? I should go home . Yeah , me , too . ( SIGHS ) Thank you . You 're a star , Sophie . - Thank you , David . - For what ? - Everything . - ( SIGHS ) ( CHUCKLES ) So , you 're near-sighted , huh ? ( CHUCKLES ) Have you been recording me the whole time ? Come here . Stop . Come here . Sit on me . ( EXHALES ) Fuck me . ( SOPHIE MOANING ) ( KEYBOARD CLACKING ) ACTOR : Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair . Still kinda dull , don 't you think ? It 's fine . It 's great . We 're all going to Cannes . Put the warning on and send it . - Do you have that copy ? - ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) The warning stuff ? ( SIGHS ) That 's not my job , Hollis . How is that not your job ? They 're approving constantly . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Hey . Hi . How are you ? - I have a headache . - Tell me about it . ( CLEARS THROAT ) I sort of lost track of what I wanted to say . ( CHUCKLES ) I can tell . Was it about last night ? Yes . Yeah , that was a surprise . When I woke up today , I thought I 'd dreamt it . We should , uh ... We should be careful . Okay . And that 's the ... This is the general point , is ... MAN : Right , that 's what they said that they wanted to work in , so , we 're kind of like working around that , but ... ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CELL PHONE CHIMING ) They had dragon fruit at the market . Mmm . Dragon fruit is by far the most exotic of fruits . Hmm . - Thank you . - Mmm-hmm . This is delicious . - Thank you . - You 're getting so good at cooking . ( BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY ) - So , how was your day at work ? - It was really good . I met with Reggie and he showed me some stuff , - and it 's really coming along . - Hmm . Do you want to hear something crazy ? Sure . Um , have you ever heard of coltan ? Coltan ? - Mmm-hmm . - Mmm-mmm . It 's this , um , rare earth mineral that they get from the mines in Congo . And they have these children that work there , for these warlords , I guess . But they don 't pay them anything . I mean , like , they don 't even make enough to eat . Wow . And there 's no regulations or anything . So , if they do anything wrong , the children , they , they cut their arms off . - That 's terrible . - Yeah . And , baby , when you think about it , what they use it for , it 's stuff that we use every day . I mean , it 's like ... - Cell phones and laptops and everything . - That 's fucked up . Do you think that they use it to make those AR goggles that you 're working on ? I doubt it . Really ? Honestly , I don 't really know . Hmm . I think they do . - I could find out for you if you want . - They 're called Augmenta , right ? - Mmm-hmm . - Right , then they do . I checked . Okay . Isn 't that crazy ? I 'm gonna go get some more wine . Why 'd you ask me ? I mean , if you already knew , is that like a trap or something ? What ? No . No , it just ... I think it 's so terrible ... I mean , what they 're doing to the children and when you think about why , so that we can check our email in our sunglasses , which is like the last thing that we need in the world right now . Why do you look at that stuff ? It just makes you upset . That 's not the point . What is the point ? Well , I just thought you would want to know . I mean , you 're helping them ... You 're helping them sell these things , so ... Oh , my God . You just said they use it in everything . Yeah , but this is something that you 're working on . So , I should what , Juliette ? Go mention to the marketing department of this giant corporation that my girlfriend read a couple of articles - on the Internet ? - No . That 's not what I 'm saying . And that they may be implicated in chopping the arms off young children ? So , thanks for giving us all this money . Also , why would you chop off the arms of someone who works in your mine ? - Okay , it 's to frighten the others , obviously . - No , no . When you 're working with these multi-national corporations , they 're liable for that kind of stuff and they look out for it . - I read the article . That 's not how it works . - Well , the article was wrong . It was in the New York Times , so ... Then the New York Times was wrong . - It has been known to happen . - Okay . Okay . Okay . ( SCOFFS ) This is fucking bullshit . You quit your job because they do one thing you don 't like . - Oh . Really ? - And then you spend all day researching the Internet for evidence that the world 's a terrible place . Not ' cause you 're gonna do anything about it , but because you want to paint me as some kind of selfish , greedy asshole , - which I 'm totally not . - No . No . They don 't ask me what companies I want to work for , okay ? They tell me what to do and I try to do a good job . Doesn 't that bother you ? So what ? I should go live on top of a mountain away from the evils of capitalism ? What the fuck are you talking about ? Why not ? Why not ? You 're so stressed out all the time . I mean , I see you and you 're just , like , taking all these pills , - like the Xanax . - Oh , God . No I 'm not . And Valium . Yes , you are . And then you ... You pound scotch until you 're like a fucking zombie . You know , I find it really interesting this has suddenly become an issue just as my shit 's starting to take off at the agency . You know , this is the first time in seven years that I 've had any kind of creative control over what we 're doing , right ? I 'm winning , so there must be something wrong . Something is wrong ! You 're really unhappy . All of the time . Juliette , if you 're so concerned about how stressed out I am , why don 't you crawl back to Gary and kiss his ass to get your job back ? 'Cause as it stands right now ... - All right , fine ! - My blood money - is the only thing that 's supporting us . - Fine ! - Fine , I 'm sorry , okay ? - And let me tell you something else . - Fuck , I 'm sorry ! - You know in the back of your mind you can always fall back on your fucking parents . - That 's not fair . - Which is why you have the luxury of researching the plight of the third world . Which , by the way ... - Don 't yell at me ! - I know you 're not gonna do anything about . - Don 't yell at me . - You fucking hypocrite ! Jesus Christ ! You 're like a 12-year-old , who just found out there 's other people in the world - besides you ! - ( DOOR SLAMS ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Text Sophie . Meet me at the Wythe Hotel . Question mark , send . Thanks-thank-thank-thank ... Have you been recording me the whole time ? ( DISTORTED ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) What 's up , Reggie ? Hey , Da-veed . So , yeah , so I was thinking about this whole visual synthesizer thing with the augmented technology and it 's cool , but it 's a little bit ... Hmm , I don 't know , a little bit too much in the entertainment arena . So , and that 's cool , obviously But I 'm kind of interested in deeper implications with the technology . Yeah . Really to change your psychological outlook ... - Yeah , totally . - On what it means to be who you are . Yeah . Sounds good . I think that that 's heavier . That 's a heavier concept . You know , as an example , there was this homeless lady , that I did a 3-D rendering of under a bridge . And I was like , " Wow , how could I incorporate that into my reality ? " And it was absolutely - and completely horrifying . - DAVID : Uh-huh . Um , and I was like ... Wow - " That 's what 's missing . " - Uh-huh . You know ? In order to get down into the things that you would normally try to avoid all of your life . Until maybe the end of your life where you 're like , " I should have confronted that . " But now we give people the option to confront it now There 's a lot of now-ness going on with this . This technology 's gonna be amazing . People are gonna wish they never put on those glasses . - Yeah . Yeah . - But , they 're gonna be thankful when they do take them off . That sounds great . And they 're gonna think , " What was that ? " and put them back on again . I think that this is a new - ultra-humanistic therapeutic tool . - Yeah . And I 'm just really excited . And I think it 's gonna be ... I think it 's gonna be fucking awesome . So , anyways , what do you think ? - It sounds great , Reggie . Really . - Oh , really ? Okay , Cool . All right , well , I 'm gonna , I 'm gonna get started on that right away , Thanks , man . ( SNIFFLING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ) - ERIN : Oh , hi , Juliette . - Hi , Erin . Um , is there any space left in Shana 's class ? Oh , actually Shana 's out today . Govindas is subbing . Great . If you can , keep extending the arms and go down . Left shoulder towards the left knee . Great . Now lift and open the chest . Drive the arms long and then take the left hand down . Great . Breathe . Get strong there . If the arms are helping you , let them help you more . Straighten the arms . Drive the spine long . Make more space . See if you can get the legs underneath you , and then go up . From the left hand , go up . All right , Juliette , stay . Everyone come out of it . Come out slowly . Controlled , come out , bring your feet together . And then come over quickly , come take a look . So , it 's going well , but there 's a little bit ... She 's working , yeah ? She 's working , working , working , trying to come to it . Let 's see if we can bring it to her . Yeah . The Earth there . Bring your foot to mine . Great . Now she has somewhere to go . Yeah ? Somewhere to come from . And the chest can open , the spine . Now less effort , right ? She 's breathing a little more . Face is relaxed . Great . And now she can even come up to balance from here , yeah ? Probably , yeah ? Ardha Chandrasana . Beautiful . The spine is in , the legs are underneath her . Yeah ? Beautiful . Now she can probably even grab the foot maybe , right ? And now the leg can , the other leg can help her , right ? Both legs are now driving the heart open . The breath is coming . Beautiful . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) I 'll be right back . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Are you okay ? Come here . Let 's take it slow if you want .

That would be amazing . You 're amazing . You 're amazing . Sophie ? PILOT : Panic attacks made me lose control . Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's chair .

Phalinex should not be combined with other anxiety medications . Have you seen Sophie around ? HOLLIS : Can you just get to work , David ? Please ? Are you all right ? I have to go to the bathroom . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) WIM : David . - Hi . - Hey . This looks amazing . - Yeah . We got it all up in time . - Yeah . Hi , Sophie . Hi , David . Uh , Juliette 's here . You wanna come with me ? Come with me . - We 're gonna go get a smoke . - Okay . Juliette . Sophie ! Sophie , Sophie . Wow .

Well , between you and me and the ... Hmm . I 'm barely keeping it together , so ... Cheers . Hmm ? - Oh , yeah , yeah . - Thanks . ( SNORTING ) Are you and , uh , Juliette having another one of your fights ? What do you mean ? She keeps texting me , asking if you 're staying with me . Fuck . What did you say ? What the fuck do you think I said ? I said you 're passed out drunk on the couch . Oh , man , thank you . - What 's going on ? Did you meet somebody ? - Nah , not really . - Dude , it 's me . Who is she ? Do I know her ? - ( DAVID SNORTING ) I don 't think so . You 're fucking gonna hold out on me , you secretive fuck ? - You 're not gonna tell me ? - It 's not serious . - Fucking Casey , man . - What 's going on ? I think her husband 's starting to get a little suspicious . She 's married ? Yeah , she 's married . And she 's getting real possessive . - Yeah ? - She 's freaking out when I tell her I 'm busy . And it 's like , " I 'm busy . " And she 's , like , getting fucking real jealous of Sophie , of course . Then , shows up at my place the other night . So , I 'm going down on her and fucking Sophie comes home . - Oh . She went to your house ? - What ? - I mean , that 's crazy . That 's ... - Right ? I had to hide her in the studio till Sophie fell asleep . - I was hoping she wouldn 't smell her on me . - Yeah . Fuck . Fucking crazy , man . Good thing she was drinking that night . - So you 're gonna break up with Sophie ? - What do you mean ? I mean , you know , you got involved with this model , don 't you think subconsciously , maybe you want to get out of the situation that you 're in ? - Whose side are you on , pal ? - No , I 'm on your side . I 'm on your side . But I mean , that 's a ... That 's a close fucking call , man . I mean , that 's a close fucking call . I mean , how long you gonna keep this a secret ? Know what I mean ? And think about what you 're doing to Sophie . - I mean , you know , it 's crazy . That 's ... - Fuck , you 're right . I mean , I gotta cut things off with this chick , right ? It 's crazy ? It 's crazy what I 'm doing . I 'm a fucking loser . Am I a fucking loser ? No , you 're not a loser , man . We 're both losers . You 're a bigger loser than I am . DAVID : ( GROANS ) Sack of shit . - WIM : ( GROANS ) I love you . You know that ? - I love you , too . You 're handsome . You 're a handsome guy . - Let 's go back in there . - Okay . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) JULIETTE : Oh , hi . Hi . Well , you look like shit . You 're drinking . I have a knack for it , remember ? Look , I 'm really sorry I haven 't called . Just , uh ... Don 't be sorry . Just don 't forget to eat your alfalfa . What ? Remember , we 're just two little bunnies in a cage . But outside the cage , there are eagles and there are foxes , and there are hawks . No . - Are you okay ? - Yes . David , man , what 's up ? This is great . You see Sophie 's costume ? It 's great . - Was that David 's girlfriend ? - This one 's great , too , man . It 's like he got , like , a cereal box on his head . So , it 's like a childhood nostalgia thing . Yeah . I felt it there . ( SOFTLY ) I love you , Sophie . I love you , Sophie . I love you . SOPHIE AVATAR : I love you , David . - Good luck today , sweetheart . - See you later , baby . David , the clients are here , right ? Panic attacks are making me lose control . - Jamie , you are so gorgeous . - It 's , it 's Becky . Thank you . That 's nice . Are you okay ? Phalinex put me back in the pilot 's seat . Homey . - How are you ? - I 'm good . - Yo . Uh , David , let 's go this way . - All right . I was thinking about why we don 't hang out more . And I realized that last year at the Christmas party , I said something to you that might have been kind of racist . - Buddy , you 're here . - Scott . - Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . We 're gonna blow their fucking minds . Consciousness , and not matter , is the fundamental element of reality , with which we have created ... ( MUMBLING ) ( GROWLS ) Is the atomic symbolization of those people who wish to understand as though it is just a binary reality in all that we are and all that we will ever be . It is not so much the tree and the organisms of single-cellular structures that form in the molecular bonds that we have to understand , but is the quantum phasic entanglement . And it is who we desire to be through pain and justice and understanding . The illusion , which keeps us in our place . Remember . If you don 't have enough stuff to do , you can always remember that you 're a conscious individual . And all is one . Namaste . I can see the head . Keep pushing . Yeah ! Fuck yeah ! Because you 're worth it . DAVID : I don 't get what they 're so upset about , Scott . They say " antisocial " and " grotesque " like that 's always bad . I 'm with you , man , but ... Reggie 's trying to get people to confront their shadow . All right , cool , so we 'll get different footage from him . Why ? Because they hated the footage he provided . Well , I can fucking spell it out for them if they 're too stupid to get it , okay ? But I 'm not gonna just rip it out of Reggie 's hands ! All right , calm down and please just contact him about something else . Are we gonna test it ? Are we gonna test it before we throw this away ? You know , I 've been fucking killing myself on this , right ? - I 've been fucking killing myself ! - We 're not gonna fucking test it , okay ! Contact him now ! I don 't have time for this shit , you fucking pussy ! My wife has cancer ! You think I need to hear about your fucking footage ? Fuck off ! Get out of here , for fuck 's sake ! Why are we even talking about this ? ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hey , Davsies . How 's it going ? Hey , Reggie . Uh , look , we 've got a situation . The , um ... - The client wants to look at some of the ... - I 'm just kidding . I 'm not really here . Uh , if you get this , it 's probably ' cause I just left for a place called Brazil . I 'll be there for three months and I 'm gonna be off the grid , most likely in some kind of a dilapidated structure . Maybe a lean-to , a hut , uh , perhaps just a common tent , a simple shelter made out of leaves . But if you need to get a hold of me , obviously um , hire a shaman . Um , or a remote viewer . Send me a psychic message , I 'll get it . And I 'll send one back to you . See you later , man . I 'm gonna get high . SCOTT : Hey . DAVID : Hey . SCOTT : So , we lost Augmenta . We 're eating like 500K . DAVID : Shit . SCOTT : The guys in London called . They 're making me fire you . DAVID : Okay . SCOTT : I need the glasses back . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) DAVID : Hi . Hey , man , almost done . One more . - Where the hell have you been ? - Work . Work . Well , I had to go get an engagement ring all by myself , thank you very much . Got screwed by Hasid . - You 're getting married ? - Well , one step at a time . Why don 't you get the prosecco and we 'll celebrate ? Well , I like that idea . You 're getting married ? Why are you looking at me like that ? Why not ? - Because I love you . - What are you talking about ? You said no one ever touched you like that before . David , I think you 've got the wrong idea . No , you can 't do that all of a sudden . Just pretend you don 't know what the fuck I 'm talking about . I don 't know what the fuck you 're talking about . I 'm in love with you . - Okay , you need to stop saying that . - I love you . David , you don 't even fucking know me . And you 're acting like an insane person . What 's going on , guys ? David has something he needs to tell you . WIM : Okay . I 'm in love with Sophie . Weird . - Do you love David ? - No . Well , that 's good to hear . ( WIM SIGHS ) So , now what ? - You can 't marry Wim . - Why not ? Because he 's cheating on you with this model that he ... ( DAVID GROANS ) - Shut up , man . - Oh , you hit me . Shut the fuck up . ( GROANS ) WIM : Where you going ? Where you going ? Yeah , hold that . Where you going ? You getting up ? Stay down , man . That 's enough . - Oh , you 're done ? - SOPHIE : Fuck both of you . ( DAVID GROANING ) Right there 's good . That 's the one . ( MUSIC PLAYING ) - David . - Hi . - You 're here . - I live here . - What happened to your eye ? - I got punched in the face . Who was that guy in the hall ? He 's from yoga , right ? Govindas ? Wait , did Govindas hit you ? No , Wim did . - I thought that guy 's name was Brett . - Wait . But why would Wim hit you ? This has something to do with Sophie , doesn 't it ? Look , it 's not what you 're thinking . I was ... I was using the glasses and I ... I don 't really even know what happened . It 's okay , I 'm sure he 'll forgive you . Juliette , why was that guy , Brett , here ? He goes by Govindas . It means servant of love . Okay . Why was the servant of love in our building ? David , if I tell you , you have to promise not to get mad . Look , when you left , you just disappeared . You know , you wouldn 't answer my texts , you didn 't talk to me , you were like a stranger . And I didn 't have anything . I didn 't have a home anymore . And then he came and he brought me to the ceremony . And I had the most amazing experience . It was like I could see everything from the outside . Like all of the pain and all of the suffering , and everything that I did to you and you did to me and everybody . And everybody in the whole world , there were like thousands of us . And , and we were all one , though , because we 're all just people on the inside , you know . We all just want to be good , and we just want to be loved . - Are you fucking high right now ? - No . Look , I understand how this all sounds , okay ? But everything just collapsed into this one second , and he just , he sang to me . - He sang to you ? - Yes . Jesus Christ . - David , why won 't you just listen to me ? - Because you 're ranting . And I have no idea what you 're trying to say to me . Well , can you let me explain , then ? You 're worried we had sex . Did you ? Yes . Oh , God . Don 't be mad . David , it was incredible . We were at the peak of this whole experience . And I was looking into his eyes , and that 's ... - Please , stop . - No , no , no . And that 's when I saw you . I saw you . And I realized that loving him , was loving you , was loving me because we 're all one . Did you fuck him here ? Did you fuck him in our bed ? David , I love you . I love you . And all this shit that I 've been doing to myself and doing to you , and blaming you for and blaming me , it 's not us . You know ? You 're an addict . But you 're not ... You 're not addicted to the pills , okay ? You 're just addicted to this like , misery and pain , and the cycle of misery and pain and you bring me into it , but we don 't have to do that anymore . We don 't have to do that because it 's not real . What do you mean , " It 's not real ? " I don 't know how else to explain it . - I had this incredible orgasm . - Oh , my God . No , no , no , please wait , just listen to me , okay ? 'Cause , no , I had this orgasm . And it was like my body left me and I just became , like , light . And I saw you . In nature . And we were together . And we knew how to talk to each other . And now I know it must be real because you 're here . Wait , when was this ? Like a half an hour ago . The orgasm where your body disappeared ? Look , I know it 's a lot to take in , okay ? And I understand if you don 't believe me . No . I understand . No , I mean , I can kinda see it . You can ? I mean , I have no idea what you 're talking about . ( CHUCKLES ) But I believe you . Really ? The city is killing us in small increments . ( LAUGHS ) You used to always say that . - I thought you were just complaining . - I was . No . You were right . We have to get out of here . We don 't have to go right now . Yeah . We 're gonna move Upstate . - Get an old farmhouse . - ( GASPS ) You know , my mom has that friend , Wendy , who buys all that property Upstate , - and fixes it up . - Yeah . Right . We could do that . We could find one with a barn and I 'll fix it up . You don 't know how to fix up a barn . Yeah , I 'll learn how to fix up a barn and I 'll learn blacksmithing . - Oh , you 're not gonna be a blacksmith . - No , I 'll write my book in there . Mmm . You should finish that , it was so good . You can teach yoga to the elderly and infirm . ( LAUGHS ) No , I 'm gonna learn how to cook . I 'm gonna be a really good chef . Okay . I don 't believe you , but ... - I 'm really hungry . Should I call Wendy ? - Yes . - I love you . - I love you , too . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) We should find a place without cell phone service . Ugh . - What the fuck do you want ? - David , hey , hang on . - Satan . - This thing on the glasses ... - Yes . - The thing you made of Sophie , it 's incredible , you little genius ! I don 't know what the fuck you 're talking about , man . That avatar thing . It 's amazing , they 're freaking out ! Holy shit . David , listen to me , they are freaking out , okay ? They stopped the rollout . They want to make the Sophie avatar the spokesperson for Augmenta . They 'll de-emphasize the sex stuff . Uh , Gabe says it 's implied . Well , you already fired me , Scott , so I don 't know what the fuck you want . No , they want to redo everything ! ( CHUCKLES ) We have to go to Malaysia . They 're on the phone with them right now They said , " Bring us the man who made this ! " Well , what did you tell them ? I said , " I 'll call him right now ! " David , we are gold . This is huge . I know Malaysia sounds far and it is far as hell , but we 'll do first class . It 's , it 's awesome . We 'll get wasted , we 'll pass out ... ( SCOTT CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( SIGHS )

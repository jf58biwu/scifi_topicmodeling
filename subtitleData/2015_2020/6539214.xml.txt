 Previously on The 100 ... Her actions show us a promise for a new future . Bellamy , it 's a trap ! I 've been looking for something for a long time . I believe that version two of my code is somewhere in the computer system of the Ark . Why did there need to be a version two ? Was there something wrong with you ? No . Nothing was wrong with her . Listen to me , ok ? I don 't know anything more about Clarke , all right ? Forget about Clarke . Tell me about this . I remain certain that Becca went into space . Unfortunately , it appears that she wasn 't on any of the 12 stations that made up the Ark . But there were supposed to be 13 . - Tell me more . - I wish I could . All I know is that it happened , that it was called Polaris . Stop that ! Now you 've had time to think , shall we continue our conversation about this ? I already told you everything I know the first ten times you asked me . What you told me doesn 't make any sense . How did a Sky Person come to be in possession of our most holy symbol ? Holy ? It 's a corporate logo . Wrong . This is the sacred symbol of the Commander to whom I 've dedicated my life . Now , how did you get it ? Again , Jaha gave it to me . This would be Chancellor Jaha . Yes . He told me it was the key to the City of Light and that if I swallowed it , the woman in red would take me there . The woman who 's not a woman . Yeah . That 's right . She 's a computer program , but I get that 's hard for you to grasp , considering you pray to garbage , no offense , obviously . Tell me more about this ... computer program that ended the world . Come on . I don 't have any details , ok ? On the Ark , they just told us it was countries , politics . Big surprise , they were wrong . Science log , day 128 . The A.I. basal control module continues to malfunction . _ Twitching again . I thought I had that under control . The neural interface is the key to everything . If we don 't crack that , then we might as well go back to the A.L.I.E. code and start again . We can always ask her . Becca , it 's an emergency . I need to talk to you right now . Speak of the devil . Becca , I need to talk to you . She got through the black ice encryption ... - Ok , Chris . Slow down . - I just had no idea how ... Slow down . I 'm locking in the signal . And now she 's out of the Faraday cage . It 's A.L.I.E .. She got out . She 's on the grid . She 's cracking systems . She just got through portal security for STRATCOM in Omaha . What is she doing ? She 's hacking nucular launch codes . Why ? " Too many people . " Send the A.L.I.E. ' s poison pill virus through the Web . Do it now . Kill her . I did that ten minutes ago . She 's locked me out of everything . Chris , get to the lighthouse bunker . Do it now . Doctors , there 's a situation on the ground . 27 ICBMS have been launched from China . No one knows why , but it 's real . They 're headed for the United States . Open the window . I 've told the crew to contact their families . If there 's anyone you need to talk to ... Commander , we finally got a hold of your wife . I 'm here . Patch her through . - Cole ? - Emily ? I 'm here . Oh , thank God . Is Sarah with you ? She 's here , too . Is it true , what they 're saying on the news ? Yes . It 's true . Hey , can you put her on the phone with us ? I want her to hear my voice . Please . Yes . Here she is . Daddy ? Hey , baby girl . Poppy got me a bike . Can you teach me how to ride it ? Of course . I 'll teach you to ride it as soon as we ... Signal lost . What have I done ? We gather here on this ascension day to honor the commanders that came before me , those who live on within me as I will live on within one of you . What crimes ? What happened ? Skaikru attacked their village . Because their warriors were lost when your people massacred the army we had sent to protect you , their village was defenseless . How dare you bring this to me on ascension day ? I did not bring this here , Heda . You did . Against my advice , you made Skaikru the 13th clan . They rejected this , murdering hundreds of your people , and yet on the very field where they died , you decided to forgive the killers , but his provocation is proof . Blood must not have blood has failed . All that can stop this now is war . Clarke ? Clarke 's opinion in this matter is not exactly unbiased . Titus is right . I would do anything to save my people . You know that , but I know them . Not everyone agrees with Chancellor Pike . Kane doesn 't . Octavia doesn 't . Your people did not vote for Kane . Some of them did . We need to give them time to see that they made the wrong choice and fix it . And you believe your people will take him out themselves . If they don 't , if instead they use this time to plan their next attack , we must act now , Heda . Make an example of the 13th clan . Show the other 12 what happens when they defy you . You got them back when you killed the Ice Queen , but the coalition is still fragile . If you don 't act now ... Today I call upon the armies of the 12 clans to march on Arkadia . Not to attack , but to contain . We will blockade the 13th clan . We will keep them from the lands they wish to possess . We will give them time to take out their leaders from within . Once they rise up against them , and we will welcome them back as one of us . You heard the Commander . Send riders . Tell your armies to set up a buffer zone around Arkadia . Five miles should be enough to keep them away from our villages . What are their orders , Heda ? Any Skaikru caught across the line will be subject to a kill order . Heda , I do not understand . How is this vengeance ? It is not vengeance , my brother . It is justice . Skaikru killed my sons and my brother and my wife . If the spirit of the Commander will not protect us , then what will ? You mind yourself , Semet . Blood must have blood . This will do . " Polis . " Polaris . Step away from your instruments right now . I own this space station , Commander . You don 't give me orders . I do now that I know the nature of your research . You told him ? The people of the Ark deserve to know what we 're working on before we bring it on board . Today is unity day . Listen to your assistant , Doc . Ok . No . Please just stay out of this , Commander . Stay out of this ? For two years , I 've done everything humanly possible to keep this boat alive , and now I find out that not only did an artificial intelligence that you designed end the world , but you 're still working on it . Listen to me , Doctor , and listen good . We 're set to begin docking maneuvers in two hours , 13 space stations becoming one , possibly the greatest feat of engineering in human history , all designed to ride out the nightmare that you created . I understand the stakes , Commander . - Do you ? - Yes . Good . Then you 'll understand why there 's no way in hell I 'm giving a potentially genocidal A.I. access to what 's left of the human race . I agree with him . We can 't join the Ark until that thing is ... That thing is what will save us . A.L.I.E. 1 didn 't understand what it meant to be human , yes , but A.L.I.E. 2 will . It 's designed to interface with humanity on a biological level . It will understand the value of life by coexisting with us . Ok , Commander . Let me ask you this . Do you honestly believe that there are enough smart people on these 13 stations to save us , that their calculations are right , that there is enough air to last two centuries , enough food ? A.L.I.E. 2 will run all the possibilities . She 'll see the mistakes before we ever make them . It will know our wants and needs because they 're its wants and needs . The code is in that crystal matrix . No . No . No . - Hey ... - Please . Please . Killing it is killing us . We will need the prototypes and the system 's hard drives , too . Gather it up . I 'll be right back with something to float it in . Get the hell out of my lab . Becca , come on . Get out ! Joining the Ark is our last hope . You can 't stop this . Listen , Becca . Becca , what are you doing ? Security protocol initiated . No wonder you wanted to stay . Stop . You know why I 'm here . - Are you ok ? - Yeah , fine . I saw Indra in the crowd . Why wasn 't she with Lexa ? Indra 's not doing so well , Octavia . We can 't deal with that right now . Ok , so what do we do ? I have to talk to Lexa . You just did that and came out with a kill order on all of us . That 's the second time that she left us all to die . The 12 clans want a war . You know that . Lexa 's just trying not to wipe us out . Why am I not surprised that you 're still defending her ? I 'll see what I can do . Stay here . Yeah , right . Someone tried to kill you today . How are you this calm ? You 're angry about the kill order . Yes . How else would you have me enforce a blockade ? So when do we have to leave ? We may be drawing a line , but who 's to say you can 't choose to stay on this side of it ? I told you she was not to be disturbed . I know someone who might . Wanheda , blockade goes into effect at dawn . I 've made arrangements for you to take one of our fastest horses . Thank you . Actually , I 've asked Clarke to stay in Polis as my guest . Clarke , will you excuse us ? On this sacred day , I beg you to remember my teachings . Love is weakness . To be commander is to be alone . I will not hear this again . Yes , you will . Your feelings for Clarke put both of you in danger . Your kill order must be fully enforced . If you care for Clarke , you will send her home . It is the only way that she will be safe . Don 't make her pay the price for your mistakes as Costia did . My mistakes ? Azgeda cut off Costia 's head and delivered it to my bed , and still I let them into my alliance . I 'm more than capable of separating feelings from duty . I 'm sorry , Lexa . I didn 't mean to offend you . Yes , you did ... But you also mean well , and I know that , Teacher . May I make arrangements for Clarke 's departure ? That 's up to Clarke . I know where you stand , Titus . You waste your time . Go away . I need the woman I served as second . I need the warrior who taught me to be who I am . I said , get out of here , Sky Girl . Indra , please . I 'm going back to fight my own people , the people who did this to you . I will fight my own brother if I have to , but I can 't do it alone . One word from you , and Trikru will ... You see ? Even someone as slow and as weak as you can put me on my back . I should have died on that field . We all die . You can either do that here feeling sorry for yourself or you come back with me and get your revenge . The choice is yours . No , no . Hey , hey , listen . I 'll tell you what you want to know about the chip , ok , please , but you think it has something to do with Polaris , right ? It 's the Space Station it came down from . I could show you . Please . I could show you . Please . I 'm guessing you think it 's " Polis " because the " A " and the " R , " they burned off during re-entry . You see ? Ok . You see that ? All I see is a man who 'd say anything not to die . That may be true , but so is this . Polaris , that 's part of our story , too . It was our 13th station . My faith has got nothing to do with yours . Trust me , I have no faith , but look . I can prove it to you . The end of the world , the mushroom cloud . It 's why we had to stay in space . You guys call us Skaikru , right ? That 's why . Polaris , as the story goes , was the only station that wouldn 't join Skaikru , so they blew it up . That 's a novel concept . Continue . Anyway , I 'm thinking that maybe this person , she somehow got out in time , right , because ... look ... here she is again . She 's there surrounded by all those ... I don 't know . I don 't really know what those are . The first Natblida . Natblidas , and there ... there she is , this woman who fell out of the sky , right ? I mean , that 's ... that 's just like us . It 's nothing like you . Becca , I need you to listen to me . I just received an emergency message from the American Station . Both the Russian and Chinese are threatening to stop docking maneuvers because we have . Becca , are you listening to me ? Alpha Station is threatening to open fire if we don 't get back in line in the next 60 seconds . They will make an example of us . Commander , if you don 't want them to fire , then begin the maneuvers . We 've been through this . The moment we dock , your A.I. Infects the other 12 stations . That 's not going to happen . One way or another , that thing dies today . Now open the damn door so we can float this thing and get on with saving the human race . I am saving the human race . Becca , please . What are you doing ? I know you want penance for what A.L.I.E. did , but this is not the way to get it . You 're right . I do have a lot to make up for . Let me save us . Polaris , this is Alpha Station . Last warning ... you have 20 seconds to comply , or you will be fired upon . Tell Commander McAdams to start the maneuvers . This is his call ... Not mine . Ten seconds , Polaris . Begin those maneuvers . - Becca , you already have the blood of billions on your hands . - Ten . - Is it worth risking the rest of us just to prove you 're right ? - Nine . - I 'm sorry . - Becca ... - Eight . - This is not what I wanted . - Seven ... Six ... Five ... Becca , what are you doing ? - Four ... - She 's taking the pod . As soon as it 's away , initiate maneuvers . Two ... The pod 's away , sir . Alpha Station , this is Polaris . We 're commencing docking maneuvers . Negative , Polaris . If we 're gonna survive up here , extreme measures will be required . She told you you can stay , didn 't she ? What did you say ? Nothing . Clarke , we both know that Pike won 't obey the blockade . We need to stop him before more of our people get killed . What if I can do more for them by just staying here ? You can 't , Clarke . We don 't have time for this . Look . We need you . The kill order goes into effect at dawn . You have an hour to say your good-byes . If you 're not there ... you 're not the person I thought you were . When do you leave ? Now . - I 'm sorry . - Don 't be . You have to go back . They 're your people . That 's why I ... That 's why you 're you . Maybe someday you and I will owe nothing more to our people . I hope so . May we meet again . If Octavia and I are gonna get behind the blockade by dawn ... This is beautiful . I got it on my ascension day , a circle for every Natblida that died when the Commander chose me . Seven circles . I thought you said there were nine novitiates at your conclave . There were . What happened to number eight ? Can we talk about something else ? We don 't have to talk at all . Murphy ? He 's alive . What did you do to my friend ? Your friend was caught stealing from people on their way to the Polis market . Hey , you 're ok . Please don 't do that . Titus , what is this about ? I 'm sorry it had to come to this , Clarke . Truly I am . I 'm leaving right now . Octavia 's waiting for me . Just let me take Murphy , and we 'll go . Wish I could . Lexa will never execute her duty while you live . Hey , Titus , think . She 's gonna know it was you . She 'll think it was him , Skaikru weapon in the hands of a Skaikru thief . She might even be angry enough to declare war ! Lexa . Heda ... No . No . Help me get her to the bed . What have I done ? I need something to stop the bleeding . You 'll be ok . Just lie still , ok ? Lie still . Don 't be afraid . You 're gonna be fine . Just stay still . She 's losing too much blood . Stay with me . What the hell is that ? Titus , what are you doing ? I will fix you . Just stay with me . Oh , no . Get away from her . Forgive me , Heda . Hey , Heda , don 't you dare give up . I 'm not . My spirit will live on . No . I 'm not letting you die . There 's nothing you can do now . The next commander will protect you . I don 't want the next commander . I want you . Okteivia kom Skaikru . I 'm ready , Heda . Clarke ... I 'm here . No . No . I won 't accept that . You were right , Clarke . Life is about more than just surviving . In peace may you leave the shore . In love may you find the next . Safe passage on your travels ... Until our final journey on the ground . May we meet again . - I must complete the ritual . - No ... Please . The Commander 's spirit must be passed on . This is my purpose . You must allow me to complete the task . It is what the Commander wanted . Come on . We should go . Ok ? No . What are you doing ? The sacred symbol . Suit breach . Suit breach . Suit breach . Suit breach . Suit breach . Radiation level ... critical . Radiation level ... critical . I 'm here to help ! What are you doing ? Oh , my God . What the hell ? What is that ? It 's an A.I. Wrong . It 's the spirit of the Commander . May her spirit choose wisely .

 ♫ All I wanted to say ♫ Was simply hello ♫ But the mistakes that I made ♫ Too late , I 'm afraid ♫ But true love never ceases ( ominous music ) - Hi . You got a light ? - Don 't smoke . ( ominous music ) - How did you light yours then ? - I 'm a superhero . ( ominous music ) - Can I give you a ride somewhere ? - No . ( ominous music ) ♫ That I made ♫ Too late , I 'm afraid - Hey , you sure you don 't want a ride ? I mean , I 'm going this way anyway . ♫ Into pieces ( ominous music ) ( door slams ) ( ominous music ) - Piss off . ( grunting ) - Where are your super powers now ? ( explosion ) - Told ya , jerk . ( snappy music ) ( moaning ) - You can 't sell this place , you can 't take me away from here . ( ominous music ) ( heavy breathing )

Now you 've finally found one . Our companies have funded your operation for years . I think we 've earned the right to study it . Our companies have funded your operation for years . Robert , these machines are conscious . Our companies have funded your operation for years . How do you know they don 't just simulate it ? Our companies have funded your operation for years . - How do I know you don 't ? - ( laughs ) Our companies have funded your operation for years . I knew David Elster . Our companies have funded your operation for years . A simulation would be of no interest . Our companies have funded your operation for years . His goal was to create machine life , as he called it . Our companies have funded your operation for years . Oh , so they 're alive now . Our companies have funded your operation for years . No , a parody of it , which is why they are so dangerous . Our companies have funded your operation for years . Oh , come on . They 're just freaks .

A mathematician named John von Neumann coined the term in the 1950s A mathematician named John von Neumann to describe the inevitable point in the future A mathematician named John von Neumann when technology surpasses us . A mathematician named John von Neumann When it becomes able to improve A mathematician named John von Neumann and reproduce itself without our help . A mathematician named John von Neumann It is the moment we become inferior to the machine . A mathematician named John von Neumann Now our world is on the verge of becoming dependent on Synth labor . A mathematician named John von Neumann Now these Synths are physically no different to any others , A mathematician named John von Neumann and yet Elster gave them consciousness . A mathematician named John von Neumann If it could be done for the few , A mathematician named John von Neumann it can be done for the more . A mathematician named John von Neumann And then what ? Do you think they would still want to be slaves ? And then what ? These freaks are the singularity .

Hundreds of millions operational across the world TV host : Should we be afraid of our synthetics ? and not one single verified instance TV host : Should we be afraid of our synthetics ? of a Synth knowingly injuring a human .

TV host : But do you believe that one day Dr. Dae-Sun : Think of the problems to solve before we get there . TV host : But do you believe that one day What is human emotion ? For example , what is love ? What is human emotion ? Is it something we are born with ? Or can it be learned ? Is it something we are born with ? ( door beeps , opens ) Is it something we are born with ? Panties down , not off . Is it something we are born with ? Dr. Dae-Sun : And what about the darker feelings ? Is it something we are born with ? Fear , anger , violence . Is it something we are born with ? Human consciousness is not complete without them . Is it something we are born with ? And memory , ours are subjective , fallible . Is it something we are born with ? But how do you teach a computer to forget ? Is it something we are born with ? Or to dream ? It 's something our minds need to do . Or to dream ? Would a conscious Synth have to be able to dream ? Or to dream ? To have nightmares ? Or to dream ? Of course not . They 're just machines . Of course not . ( music playing )

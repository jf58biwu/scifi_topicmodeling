 Please , please ! People are dead . Rachel 's dead . My mum , she was paralysed in a car accident . Our teacher here was the Quill 's leading terrorist . Freedom fighter . We 're just little arses of smart , who don 't even know what evil looks like . We 're so busy fighting amongst ourselves we never saw them coming . Why are you trying to make me talk about it ? My dad died ... almost two years ago . A stroke . TWO YEARS AGO . EXACTLY . Daddy ? It isn 't you . It is . I 've reached out to you across all time and space . Because dead people are doing that all the time . I mean , you hear about it constantly . The stroke came so suddenly . One moment I was here ... And the next , you were gone . There 's so much that I wanted to say to you . You 're not him . I am . I 'm a part of you , Puddle . I 'm out of here . I 'm your father , Jasper . I married your mother , Vivian . And then , two years later , we had your brothers . You died two years ago today . I was at your grave with Mum . I know that , Puddle . But I 'm here now . I know how much pain you 're in . I can help with that pain . Why don 't you take my hand ? I ... I don 't think I 'm dealing with this very well . Alien invasion or teen angst ? " Teen angst " is a pejorative phrase . He 's upstairs . What 's wrong ? They 've ... thrown me out . CALLING TANYA ... Oh , come on , Tanya ! Where are you ? NIGHT VISITING Hey . - Have you seen Tanya ? - No . She 's not been around today . It is the anniversary of her dad 's ... I know that , she 's more my friend than yours . Why does it have to be a competition ? - Did you understand the physics homework ? - What ? - Oh . - Don 't " Oh " me . Fine . Although I didn 't understand all of it either . Is that a keyboard ? Do you play that too ? Yeah . I write sometimes . You write songs ? No . Nothing ... Let 's get to physics . Was argument . One we had many times . About boys . Then it became about you . It was almost ok I liked boys . But my father ... If I don 't have a boyfriend , he doesn 't have to think about it . But you ... you exist . You are a real person . THE HUNGER GAMES Did this really happen ? Because , of course , I 'll get it . I once led an army . Yes , all right ! You know , you aren 't supposed to just drop by in this country . She 's the worst teacher I 've ever had . I don 't know how nobody notices . - She does barely anything . - I don 't know . So , what I did on question three was ... What was that ? Someone just knocked on my window . And that 's weird ... ? I 'm on the first floor . Hello , Andrearth . No one knows that name . No one alive knows that name . Therefore ... ? Therefore , you 're a dead woman . Or you 're going to be . Come , come , Andrearth . A fight ? Then again , maybe that would be the best greeting . Mum ? I 'll see you in the morning . I hope . Ram , you have to see what that is . Oh , screw you ! I don 't have to do anything . I 've done plenty already . Ram ? - Oh , come on ! - Ram ? What 's happening ? It 's just not fair ! Holy mother of Kanye ! Rachel ! Why me ? Why not Mum or your sons ? We go to the strongest pull first ... the one who misses us the most . You were like a siren song , when we stepped into this world . But how can I possibly miss you more than Mum does ? Because she 's already let me go . It 's the shape , I know . Some morphic resonance thing I don 't understand . One has to make allowances for other planets . Surely , though , even in this skin that you yourself wear so well , Andrearth surely you recognise your own sister ? How ? How are you here ? That 's a story and a half . I ain 't going nowhere . You aren 't going anywhere . The correct words aren 't always the right ones . Well , that 's true , isn 't it ? That 's what I always used to say to you . That 's what my dad used to tell me . Fair enough . All right . We are the Lan Kin . Aliens ? So you 're not him ? - I am . - You just said you 're ... The universe is so big ! So big you wouldn 't believe it . Yes , actually , I would . So , who are " the Lan Kin " ? They gather souls , Puddle . They gather our souls , or they can ... if we let them . Quill don 't have souls . We do . We just believe they die with us . They 're wrong about that . The Lan Kin ... look after them . They shepherd them . Where to ? Heaven ? If heaven is being with the souls of everyone you 've ever known ... then yes . Sounds like hell . That , too . What do you get out of it ? Souls give off energy , a perpetually renewing power source . It is mutually beneficial . The more souls that gather together , the more energy the Lan Kin have . So why are you here ? If you take my hand , I can ease your pain . Our souls will connect . So that , when it comes to your time ... many years from now you 'll be able to find me . Dad ! I know we talked about the weird stuff ... Dad , call me as soon as you get this . What ... Ram ! You can stay here as long as you need . What if that 's forever ? Then it 's forever . You know ... these weeks ... with you , I know you were different , but , now that I know why , it doesn 't matter because you are still you with all your ... strangeness . Same here . Charlie ... I would like to say something , but I don 't want you to think it 's because of this situation . - Ok . - Do not laugh at me . - Is it funny ? - No . Because sometimes I miss the human sense of humour . I mean , you 've seen that show Take Me Out . I love you . Do you ... have love where you come from ? What about Miss Quill ? I told her never to intrude unless the world is actually ending . We 've never gathered the souls of this race . Not until cracks in the universe started appearing here . We found a few souls we could help but we 'd like to help more . Right , so this is a sales pitch ? And you 've chosen a human picture of my sister to be your mouthpiece ? Tell me again why I shouldn 't kick your arse right now . The shadow kin attack happened so fast , sister . No one knew it was their last day . I know we 've rarely seen eye-to-eye ... You tried to kill me in the nest . All Quill sisters do that . It is how we know the survivors are strong . We allow you to properly say goodbye , and , thereby , ensure you 'll find one another in the hereafter . Oh , this is sounding suspiciously sentimental . Exactly the sort of nonsense that would lead one of these ridiculous humans into a trap . It 's symbiotic . You give to me as I give to you . Why does it have to be a bad thing ? I 've had bad luck with aliens recently . Well , we 're not all evil . And there is so much good in the universe . So much good . You 're hesitating , you 're wondering . What if ? There 's so much I wanted to tell you . And so much I wanted to say . I know , son . Take your mother 's hand and tell her . - Mama ? - Son ! What was that ? A soul saying goodbye . Not as clean as we 'd have liked . A lot of anger there . We are kind of a messier species than the Lan Kin is used to . So sad when we can 't let go properly . In my world , love is a practical term it is almost a business one . It means to combine what you have with what someone else has . It 's the combination that means love , not ... the wish to do it . The wish told you where love might be found ... it wasn 't love itself . What are you saying ? That my wish isn 't love ? - No . - Because , if not , then I 've given up very much for a pointless wish . No , no , no . That 's not what I 'm saying . Here , you have so much choice . But if your family is wrong for you , you can choose a different one . My family ... They never saw me as someone they needed to bother combining with . I was a valuable piece of property to be used for the good of the country . The wish , my wish had nothing to do with it . I wish for you . You wish to combine with me ? Yeah , isn 't that what we just ... ? Sometimes I think you play stupid ! How about that fight ? Matron 's rules ... no mercy . That would get in the way . It 's our limitation . We have to stay attached to the great trunk . It 's how the souls connect . I could only come this far to you . You have to come the rest of the way . Why ? Because souls can never be forced . They can only be persuaded . What can I say to make you believe me ? Oh , Puddle . - Won 't you take your father 's hand ? - Take your sister 's hand . Tell me why you call me Puddle . We were watching the regimental horses at Hyde Park . One of them did an absolutely enormous wee and you , not knowing what it was , jumped right into it . " Puddle , puddle , puddle ! " , you said . Horse wee everywhere . That doesn 't mean that ... That just means you can read my mind . It doesn 't mean that you 're actually you . I suppose that 's true , yeah , but there 's no way to convince you . You just have to believe me . I really want to . I want you to . I 've missed you so much . Dad ? April ? I think the world 's ending . How do I know that you 're not just some chameleon ? Chameleon ? An animal they have here . It changes its skin to match its background . Useful for camouflage . Have you made contact with their leaders ? Chameleons hide themselves . So what I am wondering is ... what is it you are hiding ? Maybe you should ask yourself , what am I offering ? What are they ? I don 't know , but it was connected to Rachel . Yeah , I saw . But that 's just not on ! That 's not even the third weirdest thing I have seen this month . I 'm shaking . Well , the world 's ending . The dead have come back for us . Maybe . Maybe there 's another explanation . Do you always have to be so goddamn sensible ? - Yes . - What ? Yes ! I do always have to be so goddamn sensible . Why ? Why do you say that ? Because the world isn 't sensible , haven 't you noticed ? Yeah , I 've noticed . I decided a long time ago that I could either let that break me into pieces , or make sure that it never got the chance . You just think I 'm nice or sensible but , really , it 's war . I 'm always at war . Can we please get out of here before we become one of those ? What are you offering ? Do you remember what you said to me the last time you saw me ? That if I ever saw you again , I 'd rip your heart out with my bare hands and make you watch . Good times . Well I 'd like to see you try . That 's interesting . DELAYED ... DELAYED ... DELAYED ... Wait a minute . I need to breathe . Did you mean that ? Mean what ? Being at war all the time . My dad ... He was a folk singer . He played the fiddle . And made people cry with it . Ok , he make me cry . He was always away on tour , so we didn 't see him very much , but it was nice when we did . And then it got less nice . He drank . A lot . And then he drank more . When I was eight years old , he purposely drove off the motorway with me and my mum in the car . My mum was in the passenger seat and that is why she 's paralysed . I was sitting in the back , but I didn 't get hurt . He said it was a suicide attempt , that he wasn 't thinking straight , but he still went to prison for it . I got lots of therapy . Loads of it . People were really nice . So nice , but also careful . Like , me and my mum were just glass figurines . I 'm not made of glass . What he did , it 's important , but if it 's the thing that rules , then he gets to keep doing that to us every day forever and I won 't have that . I play folk music because I love it . I won 't let him take that from me . And that 's why I 'm so goddamn sensible . You 're still shaking . Did ... D-Did you see that ? It looked like my ... parents . Do you often see your parents after sex ? What 's wrong with the sky ? Why is no one answering their phones ? It is like olden times or something . Probably cos they are all already dead . A little optimism wouldn 't kill you , Ram . No , alien shadows will kill me . Alien tattoos will kill me . - Eh ? - It 's coming from the tear . COAL HILL ACADEMY Why is there only one ? I 'm not sure , but that 's the way to Tanya 's flat . There 's something that you need to know . Something I didn 't tell you . My dad was a policeman . I know that , Puddle . My mum used to worry every night . Worry when he 'd work shifts that he wouldn 't come home . It 's not America , I 'd say . And every night , he 'd go out ... and every night he 'd come home and even if it was really late , like , even if it was like three o 'clock in the morning ... I 'd look in on you . ... he 'd look in on me . And I would always wake up . Do you know why I did that ? Because I used to do it to you when I was little . Like , little , little . I 'd ... get out of bed and come to your door and look inside ... And I 'd ask , " What are you doing , Puddle ? And I wouldn 't say anything but you knew . You knew . Yeah . You were making sure we hadn 't gone anywhere in the night . Because how could something so good ever last ? And it didn 't . I hated you for leaving . Everything was perfect and we were all so happy , and then you just left . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Daddy , I just ... Please ... Puddle . Come to your daddy . Let him listen to your pain . Let him tell you how he 'll still watch over you . You want it ? Come and take it . It has to be your choice . My choice . That 's how the Lan Kin works . I can only reach out . You have to reach back . I thought you were just giving me time to say goodbye . And this is how you 'll do it . Hey , have you seen the sk ... ? Hi , who 's this ? Oh , finally . Finally what ? Finally , you 've come down from your little love nest and are therefore implicitly under threat . Which means I can finally find out who this infuriating wolverine actually is . What ? Get a very big knife . No , wait . Get two . Why her ? She never hurt anybody . - Night visiting . - What ? Night visiting , it 's a genre of folk song . Oh , my God , I 've heard more about folk music in the last half an hour than my entire previous life . There 's been songs for centuries about people coming to your window at night . Usually ghosts of people you 've lost . Like Rachel . What do they want ? Sometimes it is a warning . Sometimes ? Sometimes they want to drag you down with them . You have no idea of what you 're giving up . Oh , do shut up , sis . Sis ? Oh , I got a screwdriver and some secateurs . I specifically asked for knives . I don 't like knives . I can 't use weapons , remember ? Right , stab that in its hand . Go on , you take your time . Come on ! What do you think this is ? Really bad phlegm ? Good . Move . Now , let 's have a little chat . I have , like , 100 missed calls from April . We 're at Tanya 's . What 's going on ? I think we 're about to find out . Is Tanya in danger ? Well ? We came to offer you release . - Yeah . - Go get her . We 'll be there as fast as we can . It 's bad . Then we 're going to save her . No , Ram ! You made one mistake . That 's not how the Lan Kin works . The Lan Kin aren 't a people . You 're a person . You are a chameleon , I 'll give you that . Taking these shapes . You see , the other thing about chameleons , really long tongues which shoot out to catch their prey . You 're just the tip of the tongue . Such a succulent species . Your grief 's so large , it will not matter what you do to this limb . I 've found a grief that will make me stronger than you little worms can imagine . What a drama queen . She must have meant Tanya . April says the main strand of it goes into her flat . Let 's kill it . You 're with us ? No one disgraces the memory of my sister by making her nice . - By the way , Matteusz lives with us now . - Whatever . I 've missed you so much . I 've missed you . Take it . That 's how it works . Two streets up . Then left . They reform as soon as you cut them . What 's it doing ? My guess is it 's gathering strength . To do what ? Like the veins of a heart . It all leads to one branch . Where 's the rest of her family ? What happens when I take your hand ? You become free . Free from pain . Free from worry . Free from this grief that haunts you . Like , how ? Will you please just listen to your father for once , young lady ? Tanya ! Don 't go to them . Why didn 't Mum open the door for them ? I feed on your release . Where are my brothers ? I 've never felt a species so in love with closure . The sweetness of the taste . - Hi . - Hi . What the ... ? You are my heart in this world , Puddle . I 'm not letting you go . - Puddle ? - And once my heart is rooted , oh , how I shall feed . You 'll have to go through us first . Very well . This will not be enough . Give me your hand , or I will kill your family . Will you let my friends go ? Tanya , don 't . Can 't you see ? Then your mum would have lost you without saying goodbye . And it gets to feed again . On her . It 's a cycle . I will let them go . There 's only so much even I can consume . You 'll take away my pain forever ? Forever . No ! Tanya , no ! Something 's happening ! Oh , release . Tanya ! What are you doing to me ? Unclean ! You are not my father ! What have you done to me ? You know , us humans are a messy species . I told you I hated my father for leaving . My grief may be strong , but my anger is stronger . And that 's what I gave you ! You poisoned me ! You don 't get to have my closure . - So how does that taste ? - Bitter . You have weakened me . But not enough . She didn 't ! - Where did she get that ? - She 's resourceful . No , no ! No ! I 'm so glad that worked . My mum ! What on earth is this mess ? What 's going on ? I 've spoken to a few , none of them seem to remember anything , which seems really convenient . The Lan Kin probably does it so it can come back and feed again . Yeah . It 'll think twice before coming back here . Hey ! Are you all right ? How did you know to come here ? Oh , nice . My mum doesn 't remember anything . - Yeah , I just said that . - Did you guys see anyone ? I saw Rachel . Tell me about it . My dad 's the wrong kind of lost . I saw my parents , but only briefly . Our bond was not strong . I 've got different ones that are stronger . We all do . We 'll beat it together . Finally , we did something as a team . My God , I 'm going to vomit . Where did you get a bus from ? I should really be walking you home . Ram , don 't you listen ? I 'm not glass . April any time you want to come night visiting ... That 's not how I meant it . I will see you at school , Ram . Because of the folk music . That 's all I meant . Hey . As long as you need . I mean it . We 'll make it work . Thank you . Thank you . I am a warrior of the Quill race . And a warrior needs a gun . The water was so cold . He knew it too . Made a fool of himself just to get my attention . - He was quite handsome . - Oh , he was very handsome . That smile . That 's how I wanted to remember him . Me too . Goodbye , Dad . - NEXT TIME - Dorothea Ames , new headteacher . INCOMING CALL : DAD Oh , my ! Somewhere there , this heart beats . April ! April 's in trouble .

 Previously on " The Shannara Chronicles " ... The Ellcrys will bare a seed that must be carried to a place called Safehold . Arion , my father , all gone . And now you are King . It 's like he 's inside my head . - Who ? - The Dagda Mor . Making me do things . What are those creatures doing here ? The Gnomes come in peace , to fight the demons as our allies . It 's the Bloodfire , I need to get inside . Amberle ! The Ellcrys is dying . As it sheds its leaves , a demon army forms , preparing to unleash its evil on our world . We 're out of time , Amberle . The last leaf has fallen in Arborlon . I can 't believe it 's really you . I 've been listening to your voice since I was just a girl . You were never just a girl . Every step you 've taken was meant to bring you here . The Bloodfire is the earth 's life force . It 's where the past , present , and future meet . It is your destiny . But I don 't understand . Why me ? You were chosen , like I once was . Fate has tied us to the Ellcrys . As I end , you will begin . End ? But I can save you , I have the seed . You are the seed , Amberle . ♪ I feel it running through my veins ♪ ♪ And I need that fire just to know ♪ ♪ That I 'm a wake ♪ ♪ Eretria ? Don 't do this to me . I can 't lose you too , I won 't . No ... no . Amberle ... Oh my God . Wil , what happened ? You lost too much blood . I thought you were ... But the stones brought you back . I guess you 're a healer after all . Where is she ? Uh ... She didn 't make it out . We need to open it back up . Amberle ! I warned you your feelings for Wil would hold you back . You must be willing to let him go . There has to be another way . Oh , this is the only way . You must choose . You must choose to sacrifice yourself . I said no ! I 'm sorry , I can 't , I just can 't . Then you have doomed us all . Amberle ! Hey , what happened in there ? It 's hard to explain . But you have the seed ? But the last leaf has fallen in Arborlon . The Dagda Mor is free . _ _ _ The Princess has emerged from the Bloodfire . She 's coming home ? Yes , but the Dagda Mor is aware of her presence . So we must prepare . I 'll send word to the Scouts . Move the citizens to the tunnels and mobilize the army . That would be the wise decision , Your Highness . I 'm still not used to people calling me that . Only a king knows the weight of a crown . 30 years ago , I stood under very similar circumstances beside your father . Did you have any words of inspiration for him ? Don 't fail . Anyone remember how to get out of this place ? I 'm working on it . And when we do , how do we get back to Arborlon ? Nobody said it was gonna be easy . We 're gonna make it , we just have to ... Run ! The Demons outnumber us a thousand to one . We cannot beat them in the field , which means restoring the Ellcrys is our only hope . Allanon assures me that Amberle has the seed and is on her way . Slanter , your men will form a perimeter and push into the woods beyond the Sanctuary . Commander Tilton and I will take the Elvin army and fortify the Sanctuary itself . We 'll be the last line of defense for whatever breaks through . Wil , help me ! We have to go ! Let 's go ! Help me close this thing ! It 's stuck ! Just leave it , we can outrun them ! What are you doing ? ! Hey ! No ! I bought you some time . Use it ! You can 't do this . We have to go back together . No , you have to go back . Don 't you get it ? We all have a part to play . I 'm doing mine , and now it 's up to you . Wil , stop . No , I 'm not leaving you here . That 's insane . Wil , it 's not up to you . I 'll come back for you , I promise . Go ! Wil ! Wil , we have to go . She wants us to go . For the boy , King Ander 's orders . I never meant to hurt you . It 's okay , it 's okay . How can I help ? I need you to get me far away , somewhere where I can 't hurt anybody . Bandon , I can 't . Catania ... do you trust me ? Yes . Then , get ready to scream . Give me the keys or I snap her neck . Now ! Drop the sword . Step back . Just let us go , he 's not going to hurt you . Don 't touch her ! No ! No ! Bandon , stop ! Stop ! No ! Stop ! He shouldn 't have touched you . ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ This world is not meant for you ♪ ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ They 're trying to capture you ♪ ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ Running is a victory ♪ ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ Beauty lays behind the hills ♪ ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ The sun will be guiding you ♪ ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ They 're dying to stop you ♪ ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ This race is a prophecy ♪ ♪ Run boy run ♪ ♪ Break out from society ♪ ♪ Nothing from the scouts . We should head down . The men will wanna see you . We were supposed to get married , remember ? Once upon a time . Well , I never officially agreed to that . I 'm sorry it took the end of the world for me to realize what a fool I 've been . It 's time . Lead the way , Commander . I have never been so happy to see anything in my entire life . No ... We can 't get through , not on horseback . Not without them seeing us . No , there has to be a way . We have to get to the Ellcrys . All right , we 'll need cover then . We need to find somewhere safe to wait for dark . I know somewhere , come on . Thanks . Wil ... It won 't be long . I know , I just ... I wanted to tell you that I ... that I wish things could be different . You know , I wish we could ... I wish we could have met before all this . Hey ... we made it . We 're almost home . And when we finish this , when everyone 's safe , we 'll have all the time in the world to do things differently . But what if we didn 't have time ? Don 't talk like that , we 're gonna make it . No , I know . I 'm not afraid anymore . Eretria was right , this is my part . I know what I have to do and ... it 's okay . But I need to tell you something first . Of course . I love you , Wil Ohmsford . And I 'm not ready to let you go , not yet . And I know this is terrible timing and you probably think ... I love you too . I always have . ♪ I 'm not alone anymore ♪ ♪ Essential love ♪ ♪ Essential love ♪ ♪ Essential love ♪ It 's dark , we should head out . What 's wrong ? Nothing , it 's ... Everything 's perfect . I 'm ready . Let 's go save a tree . _ _ _ _ _ Our hope lies in a single seed being carried here by your Princess Amberle and the last son of Shannara . With it , we can send this demon horde back to the Forbidding . For this to happen , we must buy them time . We must hold this line ... and defend the Ellcrys at all costs . I know we can win this war because I have stood alongside your King Eventine and , as fate would have it , I now stand alongside his son , King Ander . All Hail King Ander ! Your princess is out there , right now . Scared ... just like you . Giving everything she has to save us all . We must match her bravery with our own . And if we die tonight , let us fall so the Ellcrys may rise again ! So every race in the Four Lands may have a future to call its own ! Steady ! Elves ready ! Forward ! Is there a secret way in ? A back door or something ? No , not this far out . It 's a patrol . It smells us . Die , you bastard . Allanon . Perfect timing as usual . I wish I could say the same for you but the idea was to get here before the demons arrived . See , told you he 'd be happy to see us . The Gnomes are with us . Are you ready to see this through , Princess ? Stay behind us and don 't slow down . Ander , wait ! Arion ? Arion ? What are you waiting for ? Release me ! Please . Please . Goodbye , brother . Secure the door ! Keep moving ! Run for the Ellcrys , now ! Protect the princess . I told you we 'd make it . _ All right , where 's the seed ? I tried to tell you earlier ... Oh , please don 't say you dropped it . I don 't think I could take that right now . It 's me , Wil . I 'm the seed . What do you mean ? I have to become the Ellcrys . That 's how we save it . How we save everyone . I don 't understand . You ... you can 't just become a tree . I mean , what happens to ... No , please . Please . I need you to understand . I won 't make it otherwise . Door ! To the door ! Amberle , wait ! Amberle . Amberle . Please talk to me . I know you 're in there somewhere . Can 't hear her . Can 't hear anything . She will speak when she is ready . Be patient , Wil . You knew this was gonna happen , didn 't you ? You lied to us . It would not have helped if you knew . Really ? You just decided that on your own . What about Amberle ? Didn 't she deserve to know ? Amberle made the decision , not me , Wil . She understood the price . So when you told me that I could protect her , that was a lie too ? You made me believe she could be saved . Instead , I lost another person that I loved . Saving the Four Lands in the process , Wil . Do not forget that . I told you that ... magic comes with a price . You didn 't say it was her life ! Wil ... Stop ! Leave me alone . Your father would have been proud of your actions today . As am I. I had a dream Bandon was alone , drowning in a sea of black . This is my fault . I failed him . We both did . You wanted to see me , Your Grace . Yes . I wanted to thank you for everything . It was my duty . I sent soldiers to find my brother 's body , but there was no sign of him or the Warlock sword . I saw him in there , Allanon . Even in that twisted form ... it was Arion . He asked me to kill him . The Dagda Mor 's cruelty had no bounds . Haven 't been to the Sanctuary yet to see Amberle . I know her sacrifice saved us , but I just can 't believe that she 's gone . She is still with you , My Grace . She is watching over us all . For what it 's worth , I 'm grateful to you For showing me who I am . I 'm sure we 'll meet again one day . I sense that our journey has just begun . The Dagda Mor may be gone , but his presence has stirred other evils . Then let them come . But there 's something I 've gotta do first . You 're going to Safehold . You don 't know whether the rover girl is alive or dead . The mind-reading thing ... still really annoying . I promissed Eretria I 'd go back . I 'm not gonna lose her too . It 's you . _

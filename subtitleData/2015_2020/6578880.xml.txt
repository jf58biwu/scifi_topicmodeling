Help her ! Come on , now . Goddammit , will you just help her ? - You 're going away for a long time , boy . - Long time ? Old Sparky waiting for you . Can you both please shut up ? Ow . Ow . It 's too bad you banged your head on that door frame , son . Whoa , whoa , wait ! Boys ... boys come on now . Back it up . Back it up . - Back it way up . - Come on . There 's no room here , boys . Come on , now . Back it up . Stand back , now . - Do you know he 's the shooter ? - Come on , everybody , get back . Are you a member of the Communist Party ? Did you kill the girl ? Out of the way here . Come on , now , fellas . Take off your shirt . Why ? Need to check the blood type for evidence . I 'm Captain Fritz . This is Agent Hosty . What 's your name , son ? You know my name . Why don 't you tell us yourself , just for the record ? Jake Amberson . You know , these are pretty uncomfortable . We can put those in front . Mr. Amberson , can you explain what you were doing at the Texas School Book Depository today ? And don 't leave out the part about the dead girl and the dead fella . Lee Harvey Oswald , the man whose body you found on the sixth floor , was attempting to kill President Kennedy . How 'd you know that ? He told me . Lee lived in the apartment above mine . Two days ago , I heard him yelling , " The FBI isn 't gonna mess with me . I 'm gonna show them , " and then he came downstairs . He hammered on my door , and he said , " I 'm gonna show everyone what I can do . I 'm going to kill the president . " What did you say ? I said , " You 're drunk . " I didn 't believe he was serious , and then , when I woke up this morning , I couldn 't get it out of my head . I knew that Kennedy was in town , and I had this bad feeling , so ... I went to where I knew Lee worked . I guess I ... I hoped that I could talk him out of doing something stupid . Mm , let me see if I got this right . Your neighbor told you he was gonna kill the President . You and your girl follow him to work to talk him out of it , and now he 's dead . I realize it sounds crazy . It sounds more like horseshit . Your fingerprints are all over that rifle . We know that Oswald ordered that rifle under the name Alek Hidell . Now , that 's your real name , isn 't it ? No , and you 're not gonna railroad me into some bullshit confession . Son , I 'm Dallas police . I don 't have to railroad anybody . Why didn 't you stop Oswald ? That was your job . Excuse us . - Hosty , this is my jurisdiction . - I 'm gonna need the room . Now . All right . Is there anything that you 'd like to tell me , Mr. Amberson ... Or is it Mr. Epping ? I went there to stop Oswald because he was attempting ... No , no , no , no . I heard that . We can speak freely now . What does that mean ? I want the name of your handler . Give up the man who put you in play and I can get you out of the spot you 're in . I don 't have a handler . I 'm not a spy . Jake , false identity , two houses in different cities minutes apart , a partner who you call your brother , who isn 't , who committed suicide after you put him away under a false name , a murder in Jodie ... This girl 's husband ... Her name was Sadie . Right . Should I , uh , proceed to the part where you have no identity at all prior to 1960 ? Should I proceed to the part where your superior 's gonna come in here and tell you to burn that letter that Oswald wrote to you two days ago ? And what did it say ? That he was gonna do something to change the world ? The FBI gets crazy letters every day . No , you 're covering your ass because Kennedy was almost shot in the street on Hoover 's watch , and you should 've known about it . Or did you know about it , and you just didn 't take it seriously ? Is that what happened ? That 's a nice theory . Try this one on . Jake Amberson , Lee Harvey Oswald , and Sadie Dunhill . Three Russian-sponsored assassins living in the same Dallas apartment building are called to action the day Kennedy 's motorcade route is announced . An FBI sharpshooter stops the attack . In the ensuing confusion , two of the Russian spies are killed , but one remains to stand trial . That 's you , Mr. Amberson ... Epping . Doesn 't even make sense . Oswald was killed with his own rifle . Oh , I 'm not gonna let a little thing like ballistics get in the way of the truth . People love JFK . The American people need to know who to blame . It 's an easy conviction . Mm . Talk about blame ... You put me on the stand , I 'm gonna talk about Oswald and the FBI . I 'll give ' em some details about Hoover 's surveillance of JFK and his mob mistress . Then we could go on to Marilyn Monroe and Bobby . I mean , you are spying on Robert Kennedy , right ? You are not making this any easier . Look at me . I didn 't try to kill the President . I know . I don 't care . Agent Hosty . - Sir ... - Is that your superior ? Right on time . Under no circumstance is that letter to ever see daylight . You understand ? You burn it . Are you clear on how you are to proceed ? Yes , sir . Good . Who are you ? And what do you want ? All I wanted to do was save Kennedy . Y 'all fall back . Mr. Amberson has no comment . Hosty , this is my jurisdiction . Not anymore . You think the feds are gonna tell me how to direct due process ? - Get the hell out of here ! - Captain ... sir , there 's a telephone call for Mr. Amberson . I don 't give a good goddamn about a phone call for Mr. Amberson . I don 't care if it 's the President of the United States . Shut those goddamn blinds . - Hello ? - Hold for the President . Mr. Amberson , Jack Kennedy here . The Secret Service tells me that , uh , my wife and I , uh , owe you our lives . Thank you . You 're welcome , sir . The First Lady would like to speak with you . All right . - Mr. Amberson ? - Yes , ma 'am . I don 't know how to say this , but I had a feeling that something terrible could 've happened today . Thanks to you , it didn 't . Yes , ma 'am . Thank you , ma 'am . I know that you lost your fiancée . I 'm so sorry . Thank you . God bless you . Lee Harvey Oswald 's plans were interrupted by the selfless ... I can see the headlines now . " Teacher Kills Spy , Saves Kennedy . " American hero has requested to remain anonymous . In the resulting altercation , Oswald was killed by his own ... So ... Why do you think Oswald wanted to kill JFK ? He loved Castro or he was working for the Russians ? No one will ever know , I don 't think . How 'd you know about the letter ? - Did you burn it ? - I 'll tell you if you tell me . Something off about you , Amberson . You save the President 's life and ... Poof ... You walk into that bus station and disappear . - I like privacy . - Mm . Far be it for me to pull the thread on the story of a hero . If I did , the whole thing would unravel . God knows this country wants a hero . An American hero who saved the President 's life and values his privacy . That 's how our story 's gonna go . Amberson ... sorry about your girl . Chaos reigned in Dallas today when a man aimed and shot at President Kennedy during a motorcade through Dealey Plaza . Shots fired ! The assassination attempt was recorded by a local citizen , who at this time has been unidentified . The suspected assassin is one Lee Harvey Oswald . Reporters spoke to his mother , Marguerite Oswald , at her home in Dallas . Lee Harvey Oswald , my son , even after his death , has done more for his country than any other living human being . Mrs. Oswald , was your son a Communist ? Crazy day , huh ? Where y 'all headed ? Lisbon , Maine . Five bucks . I 'll fix this , Sadie . I 'll be right back . What happened to the fucking diner ? Excuse me . Uh , sorry to bother you , but what ... what year is it ? 2016 . And ... and what happened to Al 's Diner ? - It ... it used to be right there . - I don 't know . Hey , don 't mess with me , you little fucks . Come on . Is this where you live ? Yeah . Does anyone else live here ? Nope . Where 'd you come from ? Texas . Want a drink , Texas ? Sure . Oh ... Whoo . Strong . That your family ? I think you know . What do you mean ? You came back . It was you who saved me and my family in 1960 . You killed my dad . I remember you . I knew I 'd see you again . I thought you 'd be fucking old . You an angel ? No . No . I just ... when did ... When did everything change ? Just answer me ... answer me one thing . What ... Was John F. Kennedy reelected in 1964 ? What the fuck you want to know about Kennedy for ? I just do . He was president two times before Wallace . Wallace ? George Wallace was President ? What ... what about Vietnam ? - Was there a Vietnam War ? - No . And Robert Kennedy , was he ... was he killed in 1968 ? I don 't think so . 9 / 11 . Does that mean anything to you ? What did Kennedy do when he was president ? Anything good ? Oh , you talking about the camps ? The camps ? I took my mama and my brother and sister to a Kennedy refugee camp back in ' 75 . After the first bombings , we didn 't have no place else to go . The camps were bad places . Bad things happened there . Ellen got taken away , and Tugga joined the militia when he was 15 . I never seen him again . When Mama died of the flu , I just ran away . Why were ... why were they called " Kennedy camps " ? 'Cause he founded ' em when he wasn 't President anymore after the riots and the ... and the bombs . Uh , I don 't understand . I thought JFK would 've made things better . You don 't understand this world . I wanted to make a difference . That 's why I did all this . My mother , my ... My whole family ... Why 'd you save us ? I wanted to help you . Yo ... your father ... I wish ... He wasn 't a ... he was my dad . Yeah . Yeah . I never thought that everything would get so screwed up . I have to reset it . Reset what ? Everything . I have to go . Bye , Harry . I don 't want any trouble . - Just passing through , okay ? - " I don 't want trouble . " - I don 't want any trouble . - " Don 't want any trouble . " " I 'm just passing through . " - Get off me ! - " Get off me . " - Get off ! - " Get off me . " " Get off ! " Oh , for the love of Mike . Sadie ! Hi . - Hello . - Um ... We know each other . - We do ? - Uh , yeah . You 're visiting your cousins here . Uh ... - That 's right . - Yeah . You are a librarian , and you love John Steinbeck , and you 're from East Texas , went to Vanderbilt . Is that how we know each other ? No . Um ... I don 't want to seem crazy . You seem a little crazy ... I know . I know . I know . And you 're a little dirty . - I know . - Excuse me , sir . Is he with you ? Um , will you just give me a second ? Please don 't ... don 't go anywhere , okay ? Okay . What ? What ? What ? It 's got you , brother . You 're in your own loop . Look , I-I-I reset everything . It 's gonna be different . That 's what I think every time . It 's always the same loop . It goes and it goes . Sadie and I are supposed to be together . It always ends the same . Still drowning . - No . - Still ... Look , I 'm not gonna do it the same way . I know . I won 't save JFK . I-I won 't help Harry and his family . I won 't do any of that . I-I just want Sadie . Please . - No . - Please . - No . No . - I love her . Please Please ! It ends the same , over ... and over ... and over . It 's gonna be different . She 'll always die . Hey ! Is everything okay ? Yeah , uh ... Just having one of those days . You never told me how we met . Right . Um ... Well ... I do know you . Who are you ? Um ... I 'm sorry . I , uh ... I made a mistake . Well , it was nice to meet you or ... see you or whichever . I 'm Sadie . I know . All right . Tests here . Are you okay , Mr. Epping ? Yeah . I 'm Fine . Bye , sir . See you in class . Thank you . See you later . Mr. Epping ? I didn 't get the promotion , but ... I wanted to thank you for putting in the word for me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I didn 't help you . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . That 's okay , Mr. Epping . I 'm sorry . You 're a good man . I 'm sorry I didn 't help you . You 're a good man . Welcome , citizens of Jodie , and especially you , JHS alums .

" We did not ask for this room or this music . We were invited in . Therefore , because the dark surrounds us , let us turn our faces to the light . Let us endure hardship to be grateful for plenty .

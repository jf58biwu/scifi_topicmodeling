 Acknowledged . Five feet three male , medium to stocky build . - How long since the call ? - Eight minutes . We 're not going to make it . Sir , we are here to help . Just tell us what happened . Harry ! One day your luck is gonna run out . I 'm not lucky . Paramedics are now on the scene . Sir ? Police . Police ! Mr. Thomas , I 'm DI Clayton and this is DS Chohan . What 's going on ? Mr. Thomas , can you tell us where you 've been and what you 've done in the last 24 hours ? I don 't understand ! - We believe you may have been poisoned . - What ? ! Mr. Thomas , anything out of the ordinary happened ? Poisoned ? ! Who would want to poison me ? Can you remember meeting anyone you didn 't know ? - The tiniest thing ... an argument ? - No , nothing . Oh . Oh , God , my stomach . Oh ... David , stay with me . - Sir ? - Oh . - Oh , God ... - Please , help me . OK , sir , just try and stay still . - David ? - I need some adrenaline . - Help me ! Quick ! We 're losing him . Sir ? Sir ? Oh . I wanted to show you this . Golding tried to leave the country ... border controls kicked in . They should have taken him , but there was a backup car and he got away . Eve , we 'll find him . We 're getting closer . Gotta go . We 'll find him quicker if you let the bracelet help us . I know the risks . I know what I 'm asking . - I can 't . - Harry , this is Golding . This is the man that killed my mother ... that nearly killed Daisy . Yeah , and we 'll catch him . This photo proves that . But say I do , huh ? Say I let luck help us . What-what-what then ? No . We lock him up and Anna finds out she 's got some terrible disease , or-or-or whatever else this thing does to balance luck out . I don 't want anything to do with it . No more gambling . No silly risks . Nothing . Eve , we 'll find him . Gotta go . _ Suri . - I 've got those other locations for you . - Tox report ? Yes , same as the previous three . Our killer is using a syringe to inject ricin into his victims . Unless they 're treated within two hours ... Which is unlikely , as they don 't even know it 's happened . ... then , by the time the call 999 , they 're on the verge of multiple organ failure . 24 hours later ... They 're dead . I 've mapped the victims work and home locations . There . No , it 's still too spread out . I don 't suppose you 've got all their old work and home addresses ? - I mean all of them . - Yeah . Take a look at that . So , at some time over the past ten years , every victim either worked or lived around here . - Brick Lane . - That 's where we should start . Could be from Brick Lane , could be from the area , but anyone ... No ? No . All right , thanks . Thank you very much . Anything ? I don 't know what I 'm supposed to be looking for . Maybe they passed through Allen Gardens , down there . Maybe that 's the link . Spitalfields ... Maybe through the brewery . If I wanted to hide somewhere , this is the place . I 'll get someone to trawl through CCTV . See if that leads anywhere . We need something more concrete . Quick pint and a curry on me ... and there 's a gig later , if you fancy . - No , I 've got to get going . - Oh , right ... 8 : 40 at Chepstow . - I don 't do that any more . - I 'm just messing . - How many days since you last made a bet ? - 186 . Right now , I 'm off to see Anna and Daisy . - Well , I 'm proud of you . - Thanks . What 's the gig ? There 's a talk about brain and behavioural science . What ? It 'll be fun ! Yeah , and I 'm ... I 'm gutted I turned it down now . I 'm a lot of fun . I 'm the best fun you could have , full stop . - You ask any guy . - No , of course you are . No , wait ... not like that ! Yeah . Let 's stop this while we can still look at each other in the eye , eh ? - See you tomorrow . - OK , take it easy . Excuse me ... Hey ... Oi ! Oi ! Come here ! Wait ! Oi ! Oi ! Oi ! Hey ! Oh , great . Harry , what a pleasant surprise . Well , this is a professional visit , Finley . Have you got a young Asian kid in your employment ? I just chased him in here , and he got very nervous at the sight of me . You mean Rui Hirota . He started with us yesterday . Can I talk to him ? Where is he ? His English is rubbish . He 's only been in the country a day . Are you sure he 's only been here a day ? I arranged his pick-up from the airport . What 's this about ? It 's a case I 'm working on around here , but it 's a few weeks old . Then he 's not your guy . But , look , it 's not all bad . You 're here again . It 's professional . Nice to see you , Harry . I 'll make sure the kid stays out of trouble . Yeah , you do that . I don 't bet . Sure you don 't . No more bets . 14 . That 's your number , sir . Sir ? Again ? I can 't believe it ! Sir , your winnings . Sir . Sir . Sometimes it feels like I can never lose . Madam bets on 13 . You know that feeling , don 't you , Harry ? Place your bets , please . Sir bets on 7 . No more bets . 13 ! Madame wins again . This is just getting silly . Could you have someone cash in my chips , please ? Thank you ever so much . Wait . Where did you get that ? I don 't lose . How did it feel ? A proper bet , at last . I can barely remember the thrill , it 's been so long . Who are you ? Oh , how rude of me . Isabella Augustine . And you are Harry Clayton . I thought you 'd stopped all this . What on earth could have dragged you back in ? I 'm on a case . How did you get the bracelet ? Same as you , I imagine ... though you don 't seem to be having half as much fun as I have . Wait a minute . I 'm afraid you can 't go in there . I do hope we meet again , Harry . I 'm new to London . It would be charming to have someone show me around . In the meantime , good luck with your case . All the luck in the world . Eve , I need to talk to you . - I need to talk to you right now . - Harry ! Hiya . Oh , bugger . - Oi ! - Language . Great , I think it 's time we went home . OK . Well , erm , I 'll come with . Make sure you get there safely . Oh , we 're OK . No , I can pop in when we get there . You know , check she 's doing her homework ... and make you a cuppa . Or something . Yes ... it 's the " something " we 're trying to avoid , isn 't ? I 'm not trying to avoid anything . Harry ... OK , OK ! I hope you realise how well I 'm behaving . It 's noted . It 's not a walk in the park , you know ? You 're a good boy and I love you . I love you , too . I always have . OK ... I 'm gonna go home and have a very long , cold shower . That the most disgusting thing I 've ever heard in my entire life . It 's definitely time we went home . Suri , what have you got ? Helen Mitford , 28 years old . - Same killer ? - Yes . You sure ? - Poisoned like the others . - Yep . Jesus , this is speeding up . - Where does she live ? - Dalston . - Work ? - Kensington . So , neither of them near Brick Lane . I 'm sorry . I was sure you 'd found the link . Harry . Do you need some help ? Huh . Suri , check again , will you ? Perhaps she stayed at a friend 's house last night . The body was found in her own flat . Oh , yeah . Of course . What have you got so far ? George . There is an internal investigation , Harry , and I 'm still here . Maybe it 's time you started accepting what everybody else ... No . No . They just haven 't found sufficient proof , yet . - I did nothing wrong . - Mm-hm . Have you found out how he sources the poison ? The basic components are too easily manufactured ... he can get them anywhere . What about age , race ? - Any common denominators ? - I checked ! I 've gone over it a hundred times , OK ? There 's nothing . OK . I guess even the best cop runs out of luck sometimes , eh ? - Credit card details came through . - Please be good news . Guess where Helen had a curry last night . It doesn 't matter that they don 't remember her ... we know she was here , we just follow the old leads . Well , it 's got to be somewhere . But we don 't know what we 're looking for . Yeah , I know . Let 's go back to the station . I blame you for this , by the way . Why ? What did I do ? Well ... I can 't concentrate properly , now I know you 're such incredibly great fun ... . with the guys . - You 're a dick . - I 'm your senior officer . - You 're a dick , sir . - Now , that 's more like it . Look out ! Are you OK ? ! Yeah , I 'm ... - I 'm fine . - I can 't believe it missed you ! Suri ... It looks like some sort of lab . Hello ? Oh , my God . This is him . It has to be . - Is that ricin ? - Why else does he have a gas mask ? Don 't touch anything ! Unbelievable ! Un-bloody-believable . How lucky is this ? ! It isn 't it . It can 't be . What ? All this falling into our laps ? I didn 't ... It can 't be . I didn 't . I didn 't . Harry ? Hey , stop ! Police , stop ! We need backup now ! Brick Lane Passage . Male , IC4 . Come on , open the gate , eh ? It 's over . We 've seen your face . We know who you are . And who 's that , then ? I 'm no-one . Just some fool you laugh at and ignore . - Come on , come on . - This is so crazy , right ? And I could touch you ! We will have your name in half an hour , I promise you . Bummer . Just one lucky guess from getting me , aren 't you ? Why don 't you have a go ? Yeah . Not catching me today , are you ? So , how long have I got ? A week ? A few days ? - It over , son . It 's finished . - No ! Not yet . What are you planning ? You 'll see . - Big-time . - Listen to me . No matter how many people you kill , you will always lose . Not now . From now on ... I 'm going to enjoy it . No , son . Shit . Shit ! Shit ! - Come on ! - Where are you ? ! Suspect heading west . His name is Ajit Malhotra . 25 years old , born and bred in Brick Lane . Father 's dead , but we 're still looking for the mother . What about the victim , Helen ? According to her friends , they met in a bar a few years ago . She thought he was sweet but a bit clingy ... To be honest , no-one really knows . What else ? We 're building up a really good picture of him . Clever boy , good at school , according to his teachers . He had a place in the London University of Sciences to read pharmacy , but , unfortunately , his parents couldn 't afford to send him when the family business went bankrupt . Things deteriorated significantly when his father committed suicide . Three months later , Ajit had a breakdown . - When was this ? - Five years ago . He 's been on medication ever since , but he hasn 't seen a psychiatrist for over six months now . We 're bringing her in for further information . Everyone 's waiting for you to tell them what to do . Can you not ? You 're acting DSI , Harry . You 're running this case . You have to go in there . Look , if it makes you feel any better , there 's no way you could have caught him . It doesn 't matter what anyone says . We were lucky to find him in the first place . - All right , everyone . - Hey , Harry . Hard luck . I hear you were this close . So ... We now have a clear link between Ajit and the last victim , and a possible motive . Suri will give you the details . What we need now are similar links between Ajit and the other four . Well , you have that , in that he killed them . If we can work out how he knew them , why he wanted them dead , then we can figure out who 's next . That is the key to all of this . Look , it 's straightforward enough . Get your allocated actions , report back to Suri . I 'm ... going somewhere I can think . Harry . How funny . I was just thinking about you . What a coincidence . Coincidence my arse . Well , I have no idea what that means , but anyway ... Hello ! Fancy a bite to eat ? There 's the most gorgeous place nearby . Best view in London . I 'm in the middle of the case . I don 't have time for you . So , you 're still not using the bracelet . I nearly died yesterday . Oh , no . Instead , I had the luckiest break in a case I 've ever had . You said you wish me all the luck in the world , and then that happened . Was that you ? Well , it sounds rather outlandish when you put it like that ... but , then again ... You 're trouble . I 've heard you like trouble . Not any more . I suppose you must be scared . Well , you 've not had the bracelet long , have you ? Are you sure I can 't tempt you to dinner ? It 's on me . Nah . And unlike you , Harry I 'm not scared of anything . Why do think that is ? What ? What ? Five minutes , huh ? Is that all I get ? Could you not cope without me for more than five bloody minutes ? - Do I have to wipe your arses , as well ? - Oh . I 'd rather you didn 't . Jesus Christ . Not quite . Orwell brought me up to speed . Well , I should do that . You weren 't here . So , tell me what exactly did Ajit say to you ? He knows I 'll catch him . But he 's planning on something big before you do . So , we 're hours or days away from a major atrocity , and you don 't have a single concrete lead as to where to find this boy . - We almost had him . - Almost isn 't good enough . Sorry , sir ... a call for Suri . Steve ... give us a minute , will you ? - You look ... - Like death ? Well ... Thanks . Yeah , my doctor 's furious . But this case is a mess . I 'm not a DSI . I didn 't ask to be put in temporary charge . I work better on my own ... you know that . I came to visit you in the hospital a couple of times . You were unconscious and , erm , I didn 't know if you wanted to see me . Why ? Because I ended up with a bullet inside me ? Again . Because of you . Do you remember that ? I 'm sorry , sir , it 's just we found his mother . Once we lost the shop and people stopped talking to us , he ... disappeared into himself . It was like the shame stank . - You wouldn 't understand . - I understand . Too well . You have a son ? I have a daughter . Ajit was heartbroken . - When did you last see him ? - Not for a year now . Was there anyone in particular , anyone you think he wanted to take revenge on ? Why a year ? It 's a long time . He only lives round the corner . What happened ? I just told him to stop idolising his father . That he wasn 't half the man he claimed to be . And ? And ... I was glad his father was gone . I couldn 't live with that shame any more . I didn 't even mean it . We all say things , don 't we ? It 's you . You 're his next target . So , you talked to the mother ? She 's downstairs in the interview room . We have found a link between Ajit and every victim . May I ? This is David Thomas . He was a bank manager six years ago . He rejected a loan that would have funded Ajit 's university tuition . This is our first victim . Sanjiv Ganetra . He worked with Ajit three years ago in one of the restaurants in Brick Lane . He sacked him for his bad attitude . He had a grudge against each and every one , and he hasn 't been to see his mother in over a year . So , what ? You think the mother might be next ? I don 't know , I ... I-I 'm not sure . Do you want to join in here , Steve ? He 's fine . So , what do you want to do ? I want to tail Mrs. Malhotra home . Let Ajit think she 's alone , and then , when he comes to get her ... You want to use her as bait . Well , that 's ... that 's some risk . I want to catch him before he hurts anyone else . I 'll be with her at all times . Why is he not arguing with me ? All right . Set up covert surveillance . You can have , err , Suri , Steve and five officers . I can run this case on my own . Steve won 't be running anything . The internal investigation into his conduct during the Golding case found that he didn 't follow protocol and , as a result , he 's been reduced to the rank of detective constable - with immediate effect . - Is that it ? I don 't wanna hear another word about it ! Whatever anyone thinks , he works to you , Suri , OK ? Yes , sir . Right , let 's get this organised , then . Yes . - Here 's to you . - Fantastic ! Can you ? Sir ... I 've put Mrs. Malhotra in interview room three . Moaning about the colour of the walls . Thanks , Ade . It 's a bit early . You should see the custody suite ... Sarge is doing a conga . The Fell brothers ... we won the case , guilty on all counts . What ? It all kicked off in court . The defence ... Oh ... - Sorry , sir . - What you talking about ? It was Anna , sir . Anna ? What happened ? I heard you stopped mid-sentence , like you 'd seen a ghost , and then you just ran out . Who told you ? The boys at the station . You can congratulate them on their vivid powers of description . Anna ! I thought I saw Golding . Golding 's not gonna come after us . He 's gonna be as far away from you and me as he possibly can . He 's got the entire British police force searching for him . Why didn 't you call me ? Cos you don 't wanna hear it . You don 't . You want everything wiped clean . So , we 're trying , OK ? So ... So , Daisy keeps waking in the middle of the night , screaming ... - ... you know ... - What ? ! ... and my hands start shaking for no reason ... - ... but we 're fine , we 'll be fine . - Jesus ! I am so sorry . I ... You 've gotta tell me this stuff ! I promise you , nothing bad will happen to you and Daisy again . OK . - I 've got to go home . - Anna ! - So , take off the bracelet . - I can 't . Because you think it brings you luck . Because you and your addiction is now so completely out of control , you actually believe in this nonsense . I keep trying to explain to you ... let me show you . And I keep trying to tell you , it is all in your mind ! - I keep hoping there 's a chance for us . - Me , too ! Oh , God . - You have a case to deal with . - I ... I hung up . Mm . I hung up . Anna ! We miss you , Harry . Anything ? Negative , negative ... no visual . E1 , are you in position ? Roger , E1 in position . - E5 ? - E5 in position . Please , will you step away from the window ? I don 't want Ajit to think that anything is out of the ordinary . He won 't come . He 's a good boy . Just , please . All quiet . Hey , Suri ... That 's " Sarge " to you , Steve . Yeah , Sarge . All right . Listen ... I 'll take whatever punishment the DSI wants to dish out . I 'm not gonnna complain about it - and I know you 're Harry 's girl , but you really think it 's fair , that he gets nothing after all the stunts he pulled ? I know what I saw . And I 'm not Harry 's girl . Did you ever talk to any psychiatrists about his breakdown ? Those doctors and all their words . Might have been good for you . You could have understood why it happened and how you could help him . I know why it happened . I was there when they dragged his father away . I know my boy . I know how it hurt him . Staring at his father as he howled and screamed . My little boy . Sobbing and sobbing . I couldn 't even get to him . I wanted to pull him into my arms , but the police wouldn 't let me . - They dragged him away . - What ? Are you aware of this ? He was 18 , so he wasn 't a kid . I thought it was the bailiffs that kicked his father out . They tried ... but he 'd barricaded himself in , so they called the cops . Sorry ... You 're telling me that it was the police that took your husband out ? Yes , I told you that . No . No , you didn 't . Suri ? Stay there . Harry ? Orwell , did you see that ? Suri , it 's us ... we 're the target . - Steve ! Steve ! - Whoa ! Whoa , whoa ! Steve ? Harry ? Seven officers in intensive care . No deaths . The cards were soaked in scopolamine ... known as devil 's breath . Ajit mixed it with buprenorphine for increased potency . You just have to touch it to get infected . Yeah , they said that if they treated them ten minutes later , they 'd be dead . Harry , the chemicals in these cards weren 't in his flat . I don 't think he makes them there . So , they 're somewhere else . I need to see Steve . Jesus , Steve . You catch him ? No . But I will . I promise . Same old story , innit ? Harry comes up with a plan , gambles on everyone 's lives , Harry walks away fine , a colleague ends up in intensive care . I didn 't gamble . You were pretty quick to risk Mrs. Malhotra , though , weren 't you ? You 're not that sorry . We 're seven down , Harry . No time for sulking . I keep going over everything Ajit said . Trying to find something that might be missing ... but there 's nothing . I don 't believe you . I let my prejudice about you cloud my judgment . You went to jail and you were nearly killed , and that was my fault . I pray for God 's forgiveness but I must ask it of you , too . I 'm sorry . Anyway , right now we have to solve this case . - Alistair , I don 't know how to . - You have to . You 're a brilliant cop , Harry . You just make it hard for us to remember that sometimes . Me , especially . Find him , Harry . Whoa ! Shit . Sorry about that ... Sorry . OK ? I 'm sorry . Here , let me ... - _ - Fancy a bite to eat ? There 's the most gorgeous place nearby ... best view in London . Here we are , sir . You 've made it all the way here , Harry , you might as well sit down . Salute . Has anything that 's happened ... me meeting you here , the Japanese kid at the casino , even nearly catching Ajit ... has any of that happened without you controlling it ? How could I ? Do you know where he is ? Your poisoner ? Why don 't you find him yourself ? Use the bracelet . I can 't . When you were giving your bracelet , you got a warning , I imagine . Some hokey nonsense that luck balances itself out , and Yin and Yang , and other silly superstitions . - Something like that , yeah . - It 's drivel . - I 've seen how it works . - No . You believe in bad luck because you suffered it all your life . Oh , really ? You learned it from an early age . Who are you ? I 'm someone ... I seize luck and make it mine . The problem is not on your arm . It 's in your head . I can help you . Why ? Because it 's lonely having a secret like this . And you are the only other person in the world who can understand . I 've worn this for over ten years . I can teach you the good stuff . Find that buzz you 've been missing . If you 're playing me ... Funniest thing happened this morning . I was thinking about you ... again ! I can 't help it ... and as I was walking , I saw this gigantic flock of birds , I mean , huge , flying right over me . It nearly knocked me to the floor , before disappearing into this old , disused warehouse . And what 's weird is that no-one else seemed to see them . You know what they say about flocks of birds like that , don 't you ? No , what do they say ? Oh , well , they 're a portent of doom . It 's probably nothing but it did make me wonder ... If I were on the run , plotting murder , where would I hide ? The address is in there . Let luck do the rest . If my family get hurt ... - They won 't . - They might . Aye , there 's the rub . Harry , wait ! Harry ? - Harry ! - Did you know ? What ? That there was another bracelet . - Did you know that ? - No . - How about the mysterious Isabella ? - No ... why , what 's she told you ? That you 're a liar . - OK , listen ... - Luck doesn 't even itself out , you made that up . - Why would I ? - I don 't know . To stop me using it properly , to control me . I have been begging you to use it , to help me finally catch Golding . Oh , yeah . When you want to use it , it 's perfect , but for me , there 's uncertainty , there 's danger , there 's Yin and Yang . Screw you . There 's a man out there who wants to kill hundreds , maybe thousands of people , and there 's no way of beating him except for this . Exactly . So , what kind of luck would it take to stop a man like that , and what would be the price ? It 's a gamble , eh ? Suri ? - I found it . - What ? - His lab . - What ? ! How ? No sign of him , though . Jesus , you wanna see this place ... there 's masses of stuff . There 's ... bottles of sodium chloride , ethanol ... dimethyl methylphosphonate , is that it ? Phosphorus trichloride ... It 's live . It 's live ... there 's beakers and test tubes , containers and ... Harry , those are the components you need to make sarin . Oh , God , he 'll kill thousands . - Jesus . - Look , where are you ? Maybe he 'll come back there ... if we get surveillance in place ... Suri , what was the name of the university he wanted to go to ? London what ? Oh , God . London University of Science . You 've got to get here . Everyone has to get here . If he 's using sarin , he 'll need to use an air vent . You have to get to the roof , Harry . Get to the roof . I 'm coming . Ajit , stop . No . I 'm doing this , you 're not stopping me . Your father wouldn 't want this . Have you got atropine on you ? How about pralidoxime ? That 'll work . They 're just students , Ajit . They 've done nothing . It is not their fault you lost your place . They 've got futures . Well , at least they did , until today . You can 't stop me . You know you can 't . - Ajit ! - If I were you , I 'd get as far from here as you can . What if my family get hurt ? They won 't . Let luck do the rest . I 'm back . Agh ! Ajit Malhotra , I am arresting you on suspicion of murder . Anna . Harry . Oh , Jesus , what 's happened ? Oh , I was in the middle of making dinner and a bloody fox got in upstairs . I don 't know how ... it 's dragged a pigeon in , there 's blood everywhere , it 's absolutely disgusting . Oh , God ! - Oh ... - Are you all right ? Yeah . I want to know what else it can do . I want to know everything . Oh , Harry we 're going to have such fun .

 Carter : I 'm peggy carter . [ elevator bell dings ] I work for the ssr , America 's premiere covert intelligence agency . [ alarm buzzing ] My mission parameters these days are ... Agent carter , cover the phones . That all changed when an old friend Asked me to become a double agent . Howard : I have a vault . Somebody cleaned me out . A couple of weeks later , my inventions ... They start turning up on the black market . He left me with an ally . Edwin jarvis . He 'll help you in any way he can . As of this moment , howard stark is a fugitive from justice . You 're the only one that can clear my name . Thompson : What did the lab rats say ? They think it 's some kind of long-range transmitter . How long ? Moscow-long ? You can 't reveal that you found these items . They 'll only use it to tear you down . Call it in . [ siren wails ] Krzeminski : We got the stark stuff . Ease up on that , will you ? I don 't want to end up inside out . We 're getting promotions out of this . [ traffic light dings ] [ thud ] Watch where you 're going . Krzeminski would still be with us today If it wasn 't for howard stark , Whether he pulled the trigger or not . We 're only neck-deep in this mess because of him . [ train horn blows ] You 'll get your package when we get our money . You think the deal 's gonna go sour ? Not with you , me , and jimmy standing guard . [ ball thuds ] One-grand bills ? You ever even see these ? Jarvis : I can assure you that is legal tender , And far easier to transport than 50,000 singles . We 'd believe you if we saw an extra 100 of them . That was not the agreed-upon amount . [ ball thuds ] [ silence ] Mr. Mink does not smuggle goods into this country For free , mr . Jarvis . Now , the inherent value Of any commodity or service should really have no effect ... [ gun cocks ] You were saying ? [ ball rolling ] Whoever 's in there ... $ 50,000 american ... that was our understanding . $ 50,000 was for the delivery . The extra $ 100,000 's for us to keep our traps shut . And I got three guys outside that agree with me . Come out , or I 'm coming in . Who 's in there ? [ grunting ] We 'll see if he can connect when he gets out of the minors . What 's that ? Is that jimmy ? [ grunts ] [ grunts ] [ sighs ] Now , I-I-I 'm sorry , but I-I-I can 't agree To such ... pardon my language Extortion . It 's not " extrorshing . " this is a shakedown . You could hand me the money , or h could hand me the money . Very well . I have a further $ 50,000 in here . It 's all I have . Take it or leave it . Count it . Sorry , you 're counting the ransom in front of me ? Our boss is a very precise man . Your manners never cease to disappoint . [ both coughing ] [ body thuds ] [ gun cocks ] [ grunts ] [ body thuds ] you drive a hard bargain , mr . Jarvis . Hopefully our package is intact . [ jazz music plays ] ah , my favorite foreigners . Did mr . Mink have his minions blackmail you ? Indeed , sir . You certainly know how to pick your partners . Well , mr . Mink is a greedy , black-market smuggler , sure , But he got me back into the country , And he 's predictable in his greed . I like predictable , and I like greedy . [ grunts ] [ groans ] [ body thuds ] And I was so close to running the table . So , how are you two getting along ? Peggy tried anna 's goulash ? Peggy , jarvis know you can do 107 one-armed pushups ? Howard , you came back to new york city Risking notice from every american intelligence agency . Let 's get back to my place . We 'll have some sherry . I 'll explain everything . Stop the car . [ tires screech ] The residence is only a block away . What 's the matter ? See that man waiting for the bus ? That 's agent yauch . You see that sedan parked by the fire hydrant ? That is agent henry . Make a left . That was my least-known property . And another dummy corporation owns that company . The only people who know about that penthouse Besides me and jarvis are lana turner , jane russell ... You do realize that my work colleague ray krzeminski Was killed while you were out gallivanting ? I was not gallivanting . We must assume they 're about to uncover all of your residences , Your bank accounts , your corporations . So perhaps turning up unexpectedly was not your best plan . So , where can I hide ? [ sighs ] God , help me . Take a right up ahead . [ indistinct conversations ] [ brake clicks ] Ah . The griffith . How 's miriam ? [ sighs ] [ metal creaking ] [ sighs ] Get in . What ? I hate small spaces . What if the chain snaps and I fall to my death ? Don 't worry . I 'll never reveal that howard stark 's dead body Is lying rotting in the bottom of a dumbwaiter shaft . What if I suffocate ? We 'll be much more comfortable in an electric chair . Just for the record , I d ... [ whirring ] Miss carter , of all the women in this establishment , You are the one for whom I am the most worried . Oh , what a dismaying sentiment . Well , the hours you keep seem less that Of a woman gainfully employed as a telephone operator And more that of one who frequents taxi dance halls . Uh , I was just doing my laundry . Do you know how many intruders I have caught Inside that very dumbwaiter , Attempting to soil the honor of some young lady ? I am certain that many a woman Owes her virtue to your watchful eye . There are always the rebellious . Alice shaw once showed up with her sister , Whom I immediately recognized as a man in a girdle . Oh . Allow me to show you to your room . Well ... We 'll walk together . You 've been working all night on the stark case ? I got something on our dead russians . Official report on the battle of finow . Great . Only thing missing are words . Good , old u.S. Army intelligence for you . Redacted by general john mcginnis . As luck would have it , he died a month ago . What did the lab rats say about your magic typewriter ? They 're claiming it sends signals back and forth . Maybe it 's time we send a message to our enemies . I got another way of talking to our enemies . Our intelligence indicates the russians were overrun Led by this man , colonel ernst mueller . He 's due to be executed in two days For murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation . If I leave now , I might just make it in time . You 're going all the way to germany ? What 's some nazi gonna tell us about howard stark ? I got two russians who both reportedly died in finow Only to show up alive here , looking for stark 's gizmos . Nobody , including our own government , Wants to talk about what really happened in finow . Chief , you 're really gonna rely on the word of a nazi ? Son , I 'd let goering give me a hickey If he 'd get me to the bottom of this . Till I get back , you 're in charge . Good luck , chief . Thank you , chief . Miriam : Time and again , I have caught women Sneaking men inside this sacred space . Every woman was ejected at once . Are you familiar with the id and the ego ? Are they children 's characters ? Mm , good . It is unbecoming for a lady to read freud . But what you must understand is that , until a certain age , You do not know how to govern your own impulses . And that leaves me to defend young women from compulsions . Understood . [ lock turns ] Miss carter ? Hmm ? Your laundry ? [ clearing throat ] Good night , miss fry . It 's nearly 6 : 00 a.M. , miss carter . [ chuckles ] [ chuckles ] Howard ! [ lorraine giggling in distance ] [ muffled laughter ] [ chuckles ] yes ? You just woke me . [ clears throat ] not to worry . This is my cousin peggy . [ clears throat ] peggy , lorraine . Don 't you think your cousin looks just like howard stark ? My cousin is a lot shorter . [ thud ] and much better-looking . Come on , peg . We got family business to discuss . See ya . I 'll order up some sausage , eggs , couple of bloody marys . There 's no room service , howard . I 'm getting dressed and going to work . And it better include when you 're leaving my apartment . I 'm bound for rio in three days . I need to know which of my inventions you 've recovered . Why ? Well , if I know what the ssr has obtained , I can determine how many are still on the black market . But why are you here ? Why isn 't jarvis the one asking me ? 'cause jarvis doesn 't have one of these . [ camera shutter clicks ] a camera-pen ? " a camera-pen ? " I was expecting a little more enthusiasm . Any idea how long it took me To figure out lens miniaturization ? You don 't have to get changed with the door closed . I thought we were friends . [ horns honking ] [ indistinct conversations ] Gather ' round . Come on . Okay , who here knows What ray krzeminski 's middle name was ? Walter . That 's right . Walter . Ray walter krzeminski . And who knows what the most important part Of agent ray walter krzeminski 's name was ? Hmm ? W-walter ? No . " agent . " Just like all of us . Now , chief dooley 's gone to break a lead in the stark case . And while he 's gone , I 'm in charge . And while I 'm in charge , none of you will be resting . So pick up your phones , make kissy noises to your wives , 'cause we 're not going home until we start cracking heads . And if you get tired , Remember how important your names are ... Agents . Now , form a single-file up to my office , And I 'll give you your individual assignments . Come on . [ indistinct conversations ] not eager to see what job Commandant thompson has in store for you ? You mean the lunch order ? Where are you headed ? The anonymous call that led to the stark weapons ... I 'm gonna see if I can pull a print Off the phone that rang it in . The only thing you 'll pull is a bacterial infection . [ chuckles ] Hey , sousa , where do you think you 're going ? To do some real police work , o ' man of action . Hey , sousa , you know , now that krzeminski 's dead , That makes you our biggest yo-yo . Marge , start taking the lunch orders . [ door closes ] Mr. Doobin . Aah ! Aah ! Ah , miss carter . That was embarrassing . If you 'd like to get the lunch orders started , I should be able to pick up all the meals for the lab by noon . How goes the research on the stark inventions ? Aah ! Ohh ! Whoa . I got it ! I got it ! Ah , it 's been a bit of a challenge . [ camera shutter clicking ] Do you see this switch ? E-every time that I-I push this switch , I get a shock that runs right up my arm and into my skull . But do you see any other switch ? I do not . Do you remember that , uh , I used to wear glasses ? Of course . It melted the glasses right off of my face . Hmm . Now , is that the intended purpose ? But howard stark is either an ignoramus or a genius . Most likely both . Hmm . [ screaming ] [ sighs ] [ camera shutter clicking ] [ seagulls squawking ] [ foghorn blows ] frank : I 'll raise you a nickel . You gonna bet , or what ? George : A nickel ? ! Here you go . Come on . [ chuckles ] Got you . [ chuckles ] Afternoon , fellas . Hey , you want in on the action ? Ante 's a nickel . No , sir . I just want to ask you a couple questions . Either of you hear the commotion Down by the wharf the other night By the boat called the heartbreak ? Depends . You got a nickel ? [ sighs ] [ nickel clinks ] Thanks . Didn 't see a thing . I camp down on 14th street . Frank , here , though ... You been here what ? About a month , right ? [ sighs ] Keep your money . I don 't play games with po-lice . Frank , I just want to know what you saw . Were you the one who called in the tip ? I just said I ain 't got no business with johnny law . There must be some kind of ... Well , I win this hand , I guess . [ clicking ] I said $ 150,000 . Mr. Mink , we were hoodwinked . Jarvis ... he didn 't come by himself . He brought a girl . A-and five guys . O-or six . Yeah , s-six or seven guys . They ... they beat the snot out of us , And there was nothing we could do . That ... that 's the truth , mr . Mink . You are lying . [ groans ] [ thudding ] Mr. Mink , I swear I 'm telling you the truth ! What was the woman 's name ? I heard stark call her " peggy . " I swear , if I could just follow the butler , I 'll f ... I 'll find her , the money , and stark . The time for money has passed . No one crosses me . [ groans ] [ grunts , exhales sharply ] Wait . You want them dead ? I 'll kill stark and peggy . No , I 'll take care of it . [ screaming ] [ indistinct conversations ] Howard , I have the ... Howard ! Oh , for god 's sake ! [ sighs ] where are you now ? ! You 're back . Good . Uh , you know helen ? Helen , my cousin peggy . You are disgusting . Hey , look , agent sousa found howard stark . We can all rest now ! [ laughter ] Hey ! Man : Great job . No wonder we couldn 't find him . He looks rough . He may have seen something at the wharf before we arrived . The only thing that that man has seen is the bottom of a bottle . Great job . She seems ... Uninhibited . The first 10 or so might not be suitable for your eyes . [ groans ] Your inventions . [ knock on door ] Who is that ? Peggy ! Communal dining 's one of the joys Of residing at the griffith . Peggy , are you in there ? Sounds nice . Uh , stay away . Uh , actually , angie , I 'm feeling a little under the weather . No , peggy , you should go . I worry about you . You work too much . I 'll look through the rest of the photos myself . [ sighs ] Peg , are you sure ? You need pepto ? Coming . Hey , bring me back some ham , would you ? Preferably roasted . And some bread . And potatoes ... mashed . Y-you know what I like . Surprise me . So , I walk into this diner . This isn 't a joke . I walk into this diner , and everybody starts clapping . And I look around at first , confused , And then I realize , oh , they 're clapping for me , In my dress uniform , 'cause I ... Served and came back alive , like you . You and me ain 't nothing alike . So , I pretended to curtsy ... Played it off as a joke , and then I 'm working on my meal . I look up . I see another g.I. Walk in . So , I put down my fork , put down my knife , Get ready to clap ... And nobody else does a thing . Silence . That 's when I realized they weren 't clapping for me . They were clapping for this and this Clapping because I make them feel guilty , And they want to feel good . You think because I 'm wearing a suit And I got a clean shave , we 're different ? We 're not . We 're both people nobody cares about . [ sighs ] No one clapped when I came home . One guy was sleeping with my wife . Another took my job at the mill . We all got sad stories . I still don 't talk to cops , even pathetic ones . [ door opens , closes ] I 'd clap , but I don 't want to hurt your feelings . And start looking for stark like everybody else . Dooley went all the way to nuremberg to interview a nazi , And I 've got you clamoring over a bum you found down the street . If he didn 't see something , he 'd say so . He saw something . ♪ you 've changed my disposition ♪ [ indistinct conversations ] ♪ improved my point of view ♪ ♪ you flipped the switch to positive ♪ These rolls keep for three days , four if it 's cold Oh , uh , glad to hear it . Um , I don 't often steal food . Are you kidding ? Carol once fit a whole chicken down her sweater . My mom knit a special chicken pocket . Gloria 's got a compartment in her pocketbook That can fit a cup of gravy . Well , would you look at that ? Uh , I 'm going to eat in my room . I have the last five pages of the new agatha christie . Could you make me one of those that holds pickles ? [ door closes ] all of my inventions are in your lab . [ sighs ] Then why is your mustache so sad ? I need you to steal one of them back . Every one of these inventions from my vault Can cause large-scale destruction . Thankfully , they 're not all active , But this one ... this one is . London was antsy about germany dropping bombs on her , So I created the blitzkrieg button . You press the button , And you get an instant city-wide blackout . The bombers can 't see where to unload . So , essentially , it 's a glorified light switch ? I couldn 't figure out how to turn the lights back on . They went out because the electrical grids were destroyed . If that thing is activated in new york , Will be plunged into the dark ages for years to come . Well , that 's the whole reason I 'm here . I 'm the only one that can turn it off . I thought you were here because of a camera-pen . This is a mockup . You swap that round with the real thing , No one will be the wiser . I 'll figure out a way of telling the technicians What the button does without having them touch it . Since when has the u.S. Military Ever had a weapon that they didn 't use ? Don 't let anyone touch it . I 'm already considered a traitor , peggy . Don 't let me be the guy who shut down The greatest city on the planet . Ready for another adventure , mr . Jarvis ? [ car door opens , closes ] You understand I do not care About whatever petty crimes you may have committed . [ clears throat ] Sorry . Don 't mind me . [ door closes ] Just here for the dinner show . [ sighs ] I just want to know what you saw . Thompson . Mmm . Thompson . Ah , that 's good scotch . [ sighs deeply ] Thompson . Thompson , what are you doing ? Smells good . You see that ? All-american cow . Thompson , that 's enough . [ sighs ] smells good . Mmm . Mm-hmm . Mmm . It tastes even better . Agent , you should leave ! I 'll tell you what . You tell us what you saw at the boatyard ... This is all yours . There was a guy , duds all fancy . He was with a woman . They got on and off the boat before police showed up . Was it this woman ? No . She had dark hair . What else ? That 's all . It was far away . I hid when the cops came . [ clears throat ] [ grunts ] Mm-hmm . [ sighs ] Mmm . Not everybody came back from the war wanting a hug . [ sighing , panting ] [ indistinct shouting in distance ] Sir ? [ german accent ] they are measuring me for my new necktie . Please excuse the gallows humor . Colonel mueller , can we sit ? [ door closes ] May I offer you some water ? Do you know these men ? These are germans ? They 're said to have died in the battle of finow . You familiar with that battle ? I was in finow . What can you tell me ? You tell me what happened in the battle of finow I 'll help you escape . Park around the corner . When I get the real blitzkrieg button out , Drive us back to the griffith . With my heaviest foot . There 's just the single switch on it , right ? Yes , correct . Are you all right , mr . Jarvis ? I 'm ... Simply nervous on your account , miss carter . Howard came back to new york for this one invention , right ? It was a risk he knew he had to take . You don 't think he 's planning on using the device himself To wipe out a city 's electricity , do you ? Of course not . At least the blitzkrieg button isn 't like nitramene . I mean , well , if I was to accidentally activate it , No one would get hurt . Just bring the device back as fast as you can , miss carter , And then we can all stop worrying . [ indistinct conversations ] Your man , general wilhelm keitel , You ... you know he was hanged yesterday ? 25 minutes . That 's how long it took for him to die . Swinging on the rope , gagging ... Horrible way to go . See , they don 't realize that you have to measure The condemned 's weight as well as the height . Otherwise ... [ sighs ] Cyanide . You get a painless death , And nobody gets the satisfaction of watching you hang . Now , tell me what happened in the battle of finow . There was no battle of finow . Because you nazis ambushed the russians at night . No german fought any russian at finow . What we found can only be described as a massacre ... Bodies piled high and ripped apart . Whoever attacked them was long gone . Yeah , I 'm having trouble stomaching your story . I 've killed many people ... Men , women , and children . No person died by german hands At finow . [ indistinct shouting in distance ] [ door closes ] I 'm gonna need a phone . Breath mint ? Wasted our time and dooley 's scotch . [ indistinct conversations ] You sniffed out a witness everyone overlooked . Yeah , who saw a well-dressed man and a dark-haired woman . Cracked the case wide open . Now we know howard stark likes to hang out with women . Something you learn in war ... Not every battle you win is a notch on your belt . The way I hear you fought , I 'm surprised there 's any belt left to notch . Just doing what needed to be done . Didn 't we all ? Hey , sousa , where did you get that lead ? Russia ? Italy ? My femur , actually . [ scoffs ] [ door closes ] [ telephones ringing ] [ indistinct conversations ] Carter : There 's just the single switch on it , right ? Yes , correct . Are you all right , mr . Jarvis ? Just bring the device back as fast as you can , miss carter . [ breathing shakily ] [ whirring ] [ gasps ] Thompson : Marge ... Didn 't I say only the men have to work overtime ? I didn 't mean to interrupt you Enjoying the rewards of your promotion . Why do you work here ? To uphold democracy . Did you need a reminder ? But the rest of us get to do more than take lunch orders . You 'll never know the thrill of learning whether or not Agent yauch is in the mood for a club sandwich . [ chuckles ] Hmm . You 're trying to hide something , peggy . And the only one you 're fooling is you . And what 's that , agent thompson ? The natural order of the universe . You 're a woman . No man will ever consider you an equal . It 's sad , But it doesn 't make it any less true . [ sighs ] I can always come to you for the truth . Good night . [ door closes ] [ indistinct conversations ] You get it ? What 's in the vial ? What vial ? What is in the vial ? You opened it . You know how , uh , dangerous that could be ? What 's in the vial , howard ? Okay , you 're angry . I 'm not angry . I 'm just curious . What 's in the vial ? You know . We both know . I don 't . Tell me . Steve rogers ' blood . [ indistinct conversations ] [ soft music plays ] [ door closes ] I have some flowers for peggy . May I deliver them to her ? You may not . Give them here . [ sighs ] Are you the delivery man or her suitor ? I love her . Young man , please tell me ... Your name and profession . Ah . Can 't say I 'm surprised . You used me . You lied to me . You hit me ! You don 't get to use my reaction to your lies As the reason for your lies . Y-yeah , I do . I knew how much steve meant to you , Because I know how much he means to me . I was protecting you . Oh , don 't pretend this is about me and my emotions . You were out to protect you . Yeah , I didn 't want to see this turmoil that you 're in . Yeah , I know , and I was wrong . But you have to understand , A kid like me doesn 't get to where I 'm at by doing ... What ? Wanted for treason ? I grew up on the lower east side . My father sold fruit . My mother sewed shirtwaists for a factory . Let me tell you , you don 't get to climb the american ladder Without picking up some bad habits on the way . There 's a ceiling for certain types of people based on How much money your parents have , Your social class , your religion , your sex . And the only way to break through that ceiling sometimes Is to lie , so that 's my natural instinct ... to lie . I shouldn 't have lied to you . For that , trust me , I am truly sorry . Why did you have steve 's blood in the first place ? I was one of the lead scientists on project rebirth . 11 vials went to the government , 1 vial went to me . [ sighs ] does the ssr know they have the vial ? Why shouldn 't they have it ? The government 's almost through their supply . If they know they have mine , they 'll never give it back , That still doesn 't mean that you deserve to have steve 's blood . You know , I believe that sample sr-53 , That blood , captain america 's blood , Holds the key to vaccines , medications , Possibly even a cure for the common cold . Steve rogers may not still be with us , But he can still save millions of people . And how many millions of dollars are you set to make ? What the hell do you think of me ? I think you 're a man out for his own gain No matter who you 're charging . You are constantly finding holes to slither your way into In the hope of finding loose change , Only to cry when you 're bitten by another snake . You 're a man who says , " I love you , " Whilst looking over a woman 's shoulder into the mirror . Steve rogers dedicated his mind , his body , his life To the ssr and to this country , not to your bank account . I made the same pledge , but I 'm not as good as steve was . Running around for you like a corporate spy . So thank you , howard , for reminding me Who steve was and what I aspire to be . For all I know , you d steal your inventions . I need some fresh air to get away from your stink . When I 'm back , you 'll be gone . Where to ? I 'll get caught . You 're the genius . You figure it out . [ sighs ] [ whirring ] Well , hey , mister , are you lost ? Young woman , return to your room . Are ... are you looking for peggy ? Return to your room , please . Is that pistol an automatic ? I want that . [ groans ] Woman : Taxi ! Did you know ? I truly regret the way this matter was handled . I 'll take that as a " yes . " Don 't ever play poker . You rub your ear when you lie . Mr. Stark respects you , miss carter , as do I. Is there anyone else alive who holds you in such high esteem ? I can trust the actions of men who don 't respect me At least when they ask for something , they mean it . [ indistinct conversations ] You took her for granted . You can get her back . Over the last five years , I thought I 'd built up a callus apologizing for you . But this stings . Hey . Could I borrow the sports section ? Thank you . [ indistinct conversations ] [ telephone ringing ] Goering a good kisser ? [ chuckles ] That 's actually kind of funny , thompson . Yeah . [ chuckles ] so , how 's your nazi colonel ? Uh , about this time , he should be 2 inches taller . Did you find out about finow ? Mueller said there were russian bodies everywhere , Ripped to pieces . Question is , who killed them ? These guys ? No , two couldn 't kill hundreds . And why were they listed among the dead ? Unless they assumed the identities Of men who actually died there . I 've got a new wrinkle for your forehead . Log at the finow airfield . One day after our supposed battle , a plane lands . Guess who 's on it ? I don 't know . Bob hope ? Howard stark . Pour some scotch . Make it a double . We got ourselves a conspiracy .

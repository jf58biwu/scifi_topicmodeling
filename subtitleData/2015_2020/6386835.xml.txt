 Previously on " marvel 's agents of s.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You made some mistakes in your gameplay . You don 't even know the game I 'm playing . Remember this ? from the castle chamber . Okay . What if the group Who carved this symbol into the chamber door Is the same group that sent will through the portal ? Andrew : I 've only killed those who deserve it . and executioner ? Giving us more time to find a cure . I wanted to apologize For missing our meeting at norad . I will bring him to you soon enough . Time is of the essence . I 'll be in touch . [ cellphone beeps ] how about some breakfast ? [ chuckles ] [ fire crackling ] The octopus is one of the great symbols of hydra ... And they are ruthless killers . A nearly perfect predator . Same can be said of you . but not my idea of dinner . I am adaptable . too . that depends on your request . You 're one of the last heads of hydra 's old guard . Thanks in no small part to you . You should be thanking me . I trimmed the fat from your ranks . You weren 't just trimming the fat Going after the von strucker boy . You were digging . And I know what you were hoping to find . ghosts . The von strucker family vault does not exist . I 'd believe you If you hadn 't sacrificed the only heir to it . right ? That vault is said to have hydra 's greatest power . Why don 't you and I put it to good use ? [ door opens ] [ door closes ] And I don 't have time to give you a history lesson . I do have some long-standing plans And your simple vendetta ... Doesn 't currently fit in with them . I will find that vault . You 're a smart predator . But you don 't live on top of the food chain . Okay . [ gunshots ] [ gun clicks ] [ flesh pierces ] [ body thuds ] Well-fought . [ grunts ] Which means I 'm on the right track . I know where the vault is . Just don 't know how to get in . Which creates a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity For anyone who has accompanied him there . We 're not helping you . then ... Who 's on the bottom of the food chain now ? That 's the compound we used to tranquilize andrew . Those tanks should be enough to keep him sedated if need be . Tell me we 're doing the right thing . We are . Before that thing can completely take him over . And the cure you 're working on ? We 're throwing everything we can at it . He was one of the good ones ... is . I know he was a friend . You 're doing all you can . We 'll keep you up to speed on everything we do . Talk me through it . Anyone gonna talk to her ? [ engine turns over ] She 'll talk when she 's ready . [ books clattering ] stop . Stop . Stop . just go before you drop another priceless manuscript . Why don 't you go deface a picasso or something ? what are you doing ? They 're all idiots . Be nice . Sorry . Well-meaning idiots . It 's been a rough day . You brought in all these books ? [ sighs ] every volume On symbolic anthropology and iconography I could find . um ... [ tablet beeps ] This . It 's the ram 's head symbol . I think will 's distant star pathfinder program Hid it in the logo . About 200 years after the group studying the monolith Chiseled it into the floor of the castle . Yeah . No coincidence there . Tracing its origin could give us Some sort of insight into how to save ... Sorry . Just feel so bad for may . I don 't know how you get over that . She 's been giving me the hate stare since I got here . I had to sleep with one eye open last night . But you slept . for the first time in a long time . I 've been running long enough to appreciate Even if you all live on top of each other like keebler elves . but it 's big . Lots of space . Not that you need to keep your space . I know . Uh ... I 'm sorry I moved in . I hope it 's not weird . Weird ? We kissed . That happened . Do we need to talk about it ? Nope . We do not need to . Why don 't we just see what happens ? Will that happen again ? Planning takes the fun out of it . right ? You can 't just stay here . Coulson only lets people in the base Who have a role in his game plan . I feel like you 're gonna tell me I didn 't make little league all-stars . sir . uh ... maybe you two ... You can say it . Are you sleeping together ? That 's none of your business . but I need to know . or are you playing an angle ? not your business . But you really think I 'm that guy ? Into our hidden base . mack . I like roz . Whether she can be trusted ... Yet to be determined . How is that not a deal breaker ? Because the only spies without trust issues Are either young or dead . I hope I can trust roz . I want to . That 's why I 'm bringing her here face-to-face ... So I can look her in the eye and find out . the rest of you will have to go behind her back . [ indistinct conversations ] we 're launching operation spotlight . The objective ... To peer into every shadowy corner of the atcu . The last few days have been hard . But it has also created A rare moment of opportunity for us . The atcu brought dr . Garner 's containment module Into their research facility . S.H.I.E.L.D. Is going to use that as a way to gain access . Going in on the ground will be bobbi and hunter . Quarterbacking from zephyr one will be daisy and mack . Handling extraction ... may and ... Him . Okay . I guess the new guy will gain a firsthand look Of our operations with agent may . Let me be clear . what it is the atcu actually wants with them . Questions ? Daisy : Yeah . Why now ? Because I think the head of the atcu finally trusts me . I 'd like that feeling to be mutual . Let 's get to work . [ indistinct conversations ] [ tablet beeps ] that answer your concerns ? Just raises all new ones . You 've kept quiet . I admire that . [ flame hissing ] 600 degrees . I was a bit of a pyro when I was a kid . Got me into some real trouble . But damn if I don 't love the sound of that gas igniting . [ breathing heavily ] You have to incorporate what you love into your work . You want them to know it 's gonna hurt . Build anticipation . But you have to let them imagine a better world . You could walk into strucker 's vault with me . You just have to show me how . share what we find . You can torch us all you want . There 's nothing to tell . He uses different people when he travels to zepkow . And even they don 't know where the vault 's buried . Zepkow . Germany . [ grunts ] I lied . Strucker has many vaults . I know them all . Just didn 't know zepkow was the one I needed . Be proud . You stayed quiet . You would 've fit in good with my men . [ ramp clanks ] Miss price ... Welcome to s.H.I.E.L.D. [ exhales sharply ] Not exactly running things are we ? Did you give it a slick code name ? it 's home . That 's cute . Almost as cute As flying me in circles for six hours on a plane . I don 't know if I 'm in albuquerque or albania . Imagine the possibilities . And be flattered . I waived our usual blindfold protocol . director . Completely disabled my phone for the entire flight . Couldn 't even check my fantasy-football scores . Such cruelty . But we 'll need to sweep for wireless sniffers first . [ tablet beeps ] Two words I never want to hear again . cowboy . [ device beeps ] You left your intelligence-gathering phone didn 't you ? but I thought it might be rude . Please . We expect nothing less . Incoming data upload from rosalind 's phone . Okay . Let 's wake up the atcu I.T. Asap . [ display beeping ] yeah . That 's my favorite episode . darlene was set up perfectly ... Every word she said . Whoa . whoa . Did you see that ? What was that ? Did you just hack the atcu ? but the containment module Broadcasts some pretty intense encrypted homing signals . And it 'll wig the I.T. Department out real good . [ cellphone rings ] [ clears throat ] Fbi cyber investigative task force . wilson ? What exactly is going on over there ? multiple agency servers And the traffic traces back to your ips . dispatched A rapid-response unit to your location . just cooperate fully . Should be fine . [ chuckles ] they 're our absolute best . okay ? We 're showing no signs of a breach . I don 't think you 'll be necessary here . I think that it was a glitch . yeah . Of course it looks like a glitch . That 's the point . Never noticing the polymorphic root kit Buried deep inside your system ... Until hackers activate it to ... stateless multi ... Factor authentication ... Code you are so bloody proud of . Red sox fan ? actually . This guy does not look like fbi . He wasn 't . ashley madison . He 's the best consultant we have . he 'd be in jail or I 'd have shot him by now . listen . Our system 's airtight . [ scoffs ] How 'd your staff 's credentials leak out ? What ? no . There 's no way someone got past our software . Who said anything about software ? We think hardware was smuggled in . detecting some sort of broadcast ? The atcu security is way too strong . Was nothing brought into this facility in the last 24 hours ? No . Our employee 's keys don 't make it past security . uh ... [ inhales deeply ] no . I need to make a phone call . We 've had some major breakthroughs here ... prosthetics . it cuts a hell of a silhouette . they mostly got it right . [ cellphone rings ] So you did reactivate it . [ cellphone beeps ] I.T. Department That calls me only when there 's a problem . What 's the problem ? There 's an fbi task force here . An energy pulse was detected inside our facility um ... An apparent security leak . Have you found the cause ? I think it could be The s.H.I.E.L.D. Containment module we brought in . is it possible that your containment module Tried to access the atcu 's system ? Absolutely . It scans any local network it finds . All our hardware does . And we 're gonna have to go ahead and shut that down . Can 't blame a guy for trying . You 're supposed to protect the atcu from things like this . and fix it . [ cellphone beeps ] You 're lucky you 're cute . We really have to figure out other ways to flirt . Are you alphabetizing those ? Don 't be ridiculous . I 'm organizing them by subject and date . you 're procrastinating . Is there something so terrible about a comprehensive system ? Why don 't you want to go look into one of ... I 've been looking . I just don 't like what I 'm seeing . You found a lead ? Will wasn 't sent on a mission . He was sacrificed . The symbol used for his space program ? Tied to ritualistic blood sacrifice . People working with nasa . fitz ... That we never really know who 's next to us . [ sighs ] thank you . These should keep me warm . This gonna get you in trouble ? I control everything . Always ? You ever find yourself completely out of control ? I 'll be in moscow soon enough with a day off . Come see for yourself . but I 'm not going to moscow . This was the only flight I could find Passing over zepkow . [ whispers indistinctly ] And keep your seatbelts fastened . You may experience some turbulence coming up . Don 't be alarmed . That 's just your pilot diving to equalize cabin pressure Before you freeze to death . Thanks for flying the friendly skies . [ receiver clicks ] These symbols trace back thousands of years ... Groups obsessed with death and ritualistic killings . It 's intertwined with the origin of pagan devil myths . Secretly funding nasa missions . They knew something . 000 years . there 's nothing in here to help open the portal . Of course there is . it 's just copious examples of how this group was evil And used will as a blood offering . We can find out how they tried to achieve it . We 'll find something ... Something to help us bring back will . You have to stop . Excuse me ? Stop . Just stop trying to do all the right things . It 's too much . [ door slams ] Is this a silver tie-clip camera ? Platinum . 1963 . Wow . You really are a s.H.I.E.L.D. Lifer . I bet there 's a story behind each one of these That I 'd love to hear . I have a real soft spot for that golden age . They recruit you out of college ? Mm-hmm . Studying ... History . I started to inadvertently uncover how much of that history So they snatched me up . you 've really never known anyone in s.H.I.E.L.D. ? I find that hard to believe . Only in passing . Come on . You can tell me if you have . I 'm the director . You 're inside our secret base . not paranormal . You 're my first . Hmm . I got to admit . I didn 't picture you keeping things so analog . vinyl . There 's a tactile benefit ... the wear and tear . the smell . Ah . I love the smell of books . Helps me think . we both know How vulnerable the digital world is to infiltration . steve-o . Nothing worse for an I.T. Guy Than someone logging into a terminal . doesn 't it ? How do we know he 's not just looking for exploits To get into our system when it goes back to being a black hat ? there 's no going back for dane . And I 'm gonna need a log-in to determine if ... The trojan horse hardware emitted a signal pulse That allows access ... mate . Have you checked that yet ? You can use a command prompt to enter a guest username . And unwittingly give us remote access . [ monitor beeps ] [ clears throat ] type this in ... " request user . [ keyboard clacking slowly ] god . Hunter . Please tell me you know which one is forward slash . Yes . Typing . I 'm just helping your sluggish code keep up . Hilarious . And the username . Username ... " god save the queen . I let him pick it . [ monitor beeping ] Bingo . you 're up . yeah ? Yeah . I suggest you move your ass . All right . There . enhanced specimen control ... Three floors down in the science division . Ringing your phone now . [ cellphone rings ] hmm . My superiors on pennsylvania avenue . I need to step away for a moment to give them my full report . Okay . Daisy : Check that section . See how many inhumans they 're keeping in there . And grab any samples of the potential cure . Now all hunter has to do is run his mouth and waste time . he excels at that . unlocks ] Thank you . Here ? you need me to do anything ? Why bring me if you 're not even gonna talk to me ? [ engines whirring ] Where do you get off ? Are you seriously mad at me ? I 'm mad at myself for roping you into this . It 's not fair . And I 'm mad that you 're so willing to help . As opposed to what ? What do you expect ? I don 't know . Get angry . I cannot fathom any way out of this Without hurting someone I care about . You think that I 'm not angry ? ! I 'm sick to my stomach . but not at you . 'cause we 're cursed . The bloody cosmos wants us to be apart . The cosmos doesn 't want anything . I beg to differ . 'cause we had years side-by-side . Never occurred to us . We don 't have the courage to talk about it . Facing certain death . You wait until I 'm bound And then you get swept off to some far-flung planet . With him . Top-marks pilot astronaut hero man . I would do anything ... Do you love him ? [ breathes heavily ] I don 't know . I think ... Yes . Yeah . of course you do . Of course you do . And you gave each other hope on the edge of nowhere . fitz . You think I didn 't look for dirt on him ? I did . And there 's nothing . I can 't hate him . He 's great . Why else would you fall for him ? He did everything right . [ voice breaking ] and you dove Through a hole in the universe for me ! [ gasps ] [ panting ] We 're cursed . is that what I think it is ? Andrew was a phd in psychology . Now he 's a specimen . Open sesame . clicks ] [ door opens ] I 'm so sorry about everything . No one warned me there 'd be a flight . Who are you ? I 'm gideon malick . And I want to assure you that we 're working with s.H.I.E.L.D. To do everything we can to help you . With what ? A cure ? I know how pharmaceuticals work . What are you ? A decade away from treatment ? [ clears throat ] It strikes me that no one 's asked If you even want treatment . They haven 't asked have they ? No . [ scoffs lightly ] all they see is a killer . this is an invading alien contagion Which s.H.I.E.L.D. Has known about for quite some time . They protected no one ... Including you . There 's more nuance to s.H.I.E.L.D. Than that . Why worry about them ? S.H.I.E.L.D. Has good intentions but questionable methods . That much is true . They can 't help themselves From jumping into the deep end of dangerous waters . We agree on more than we don 't . dr . Garner . I need to know what else S.H.I.E.L.D. Has been hiding from us . Andrew isn 't here . are you sure this is the right area ? Daisy : That 's the place . there are no inhumans being held here . Let coulson know . Studying cell response . anyway . Then what are they doing ? Wait . anything on medications They 've compiled for study ? but those look An awful lot like fish-oil pills . I 'll look . really . every human on the planet ... you know ? You 're stealing their parents credit-card information . I 'm gonna grab some coffee . Mm-hmm . please . Thanks . bollocks . It 's time to download everything we can and make our getaway . And I do not have a handkerchief to cover my face ... anyhow . Copy that . bobbi . Giving mandatory supplements to all their employees . office workers . " any public witnesses . no . Giving terrigen to as many people as they can . they 're ... They 're turning them . Hmm . [ tablet beeps ] phil ? 'cause I might need a little persuading . it 's you who needs to convince me . Convince you ? That you 're not hydra . [ tablet beeps ] you 're never leaving this room again . phil ? Getting the truth out of you once and for all . Is this a joke ? I 'm not laughing . you think there 's some hidden secret You can just scare out of me ? I have my people infiltrating your facility . So this is your final chance to come clean . They won 't find anything out That I wouldn 't happily tell them . What 's wrong with you ? Stop lying . and what you 're hiding ? What the hell is wrong with you ? Look at you . I 'm done playing games . I wasn 't playing games . I thought ... I thought there was something between us ... Something real That wasn 't just based in this spycraft-manipulation crap . You really think this emotional appeal 's gonna work right now ? because you have no emotions . [ scoffs ] This was all a plan ? and take advantage ? Don 't try to talk your way out of this . But you just have such deep issues That you stopped trusting me as soon as you did . You lied to me . is he ? [ scoffs ] Of course not . Are you torturing me ? Is that the idea ? waiting for the other shoe to drop ? I know how dangerous you are . I 'm not apologizing for that . Because I do want to apologize ... To you . For andrew . Tried to kill you . I 'm sorry . I should 've known . [ scoffs lightly ] I should be thanking you For being willing to put those bullets in him when you did . bobbi and hunter may need extraction Sooner than we thought . [ engines rev ] Can 't charm my way out of this one . And bring me my briefcase . Hunter ? Almost finished ? things have got really complicated in here just now . Just wrong about why . I 'm not very good at computers . Aah ! now ! clicks ] [ keypad buzzes ] [ alarm blaring ] Gonna need that briefcase ! love . Of course we don 't keep inhumans at that facility . We can 't risk some duplicitous nut case Breaking in to look around . Looks like we made the right move . You 're always one step ahead . I feel like an idiot That I thought you were different . Stop with the mind games . you 're good . Pretending to fall for me ... Well enough that I actually went along for the ride . I always had one finger on the eject button . That 's because you 're incapable of anything else . No . Because you slipped up . Tahiti . talking about tahiti . So I was hoping against all hope you would confirm But you claim you have none . That 's because I 've been honest . The only other possible way that you could know about that Is if you got your intel from hydra . So why don 't you share your source ? I 'm not sharing anything with you anymore . I didn 't think so . Except for this . You know what ? phil . I did . But it turns out you 're impenetrable . You like to joke about your robot hand and not being human . I 'm not sure you 're so off the mark . that means a lot coming from you . You were stabbed through the heart . You must derive sadistic pleasure In doing the same to others . At least I didn 't use the story of my dead husband To sell the idea that the atcu was working on a cure When we both know that 's a lie . How dare you mention ... cut the melodrama . My agent at the center of your compound confirmed That you 're not trying to cure inhumans . You 're making as many as you can . What are you talking about ? enhanced specimen control . so you know what they found . No . No one 's allowed on those floors for risk of infection . Intentional infection . Handing out the contaminant as a cure ... that 's not what we ... That 's especially sinister . I get weekly reports fr ... From malick . Excuse me ? Gideon malick . I know the name . Industrialist . He once served on the world council . He 's a friend . I 've worked with him more than a decade . oversees the science ... Division . [ exhales sharply ] He gave me the tahiti intel . Connection 's down . Look . Last file we pulled ... A catalog of all the inhumans they turned and put into stasis . But ... Let me guess . They didn 't put them all in stasis . [ sighs ] too little and too late . I 'll remind you that we 're basically the same height . I just don 't wear bloody heels . [ door opens ] [ gunshots ] Aliens . I pine for the days Where we didn 't fight bloody aliens . It 's just not a fair fight . [ batons beep ] let 's see if we can level the playing field . Really ? Your batons ? That 's your game-changer ? [ batons beep ] [ gunfire ] then . Let me make a call to my people . Your people ? I don 't see that happening . Your agents are in serious danger . I can get them out . Or sell them out . look at me . Please believe that I don 't know what 's going on . We need answers ... Both of us . We lose everything . that 'll buy us very little time . [ door opens ] Come with me . I 'll get you out of here . worry on the move . He 'll lead them to the northwest parking lot . You hear that ? May is en route . I don 't see them . Got them . [ drill whirs ] Malick : I 'm hardly ever impressed . Held technology from other planets ... Didn 't really faze me . I 'm at a loss for words . [ chuckles ] You left me to die . But you ... You cut through them like cake . much less get here ? Phew ! [ chuckles ] And I have my own jet . [ blows ] This was all just a test ? I wanted you dead . You pose a legitimate threat to everything that I 've built . But now ... Now I 'm beginning to think that maybe I was looking at it From the wrong angle . You just might be hydra 's second head That 's grown right next to me . I should kill you . [ exhales sharply ] Then you 'd miss that history lesson we 've been talking about . [ chuckles ] I know you 're all about rebooting hydra and all that . our origin ? Yeah . World war ii . Red skull used nazi funding to build this whole ... no . Red skull was following That the ultimate power was not of this world . much older than that . Hydra 's actually as ancient as this stone . This one here and other surviving stones like it Have been passed down for 100 generations . mr . Ward . You don 't want to miss it when it does its thing . A monolith that possesses otherworldly properties . Literally . It 's a portal to another world . He recruited me in ' 01 . I met him when his company was consulting on a program at ... At nasa . how did you ... An inhuman was born on this planet so fearsome Sent it through the portal to a distant planet . Hydra was founded With the sole purpose of engineering its return . hydra 's taken different shapes . The entity has been given different names . ♪ ♪ Hoping to save or at least serve Our leader on the other side . Now we 're building an army And you and I will rule beside it . Okay . uh ... A lot to take in . it 's a tall tale . [ chuckles ] I know . And why exactly should I believe a word of it ? Because we 're closer than ever to the final chapter . We 're gonna write it ourselves . But you don 't have to believe me . to watch it writhe . I 'll help you do that . And in return ? You 'll help me learn how s.H.I.E.L.D. Was able To achieve something with the portal Has never been able to accomplish . And what is that ? They brought someone back . Hey ! [ door opens ] Hey . Someone want to fill me in ? How long are you gonna keep me in here Without any idea of what 's going on ? no ! I don 't need to be sedated anymore . I just ... I just ... I need to talk to someone About what 's going on . Ward : All right . Let 's talk . doc . I seem to be carrying around a lot of baggage these days . It 's nice to finally meet you . My name is grant ... I know who you are . What are you doing here ? Learning . Spent a good few days educating myself . Now we get to learn about you . You feeling powerful behind this glass ? you 're gonna die ... With a hole in your chest . but I promise ... no . this isn 't the sedation compound from s.H.I.E.L.D. This is chloroethyl sulfide ... Something . basically mustard gas . s.H.I.E.L.D. Showed us how to turn the monster off . Now we want to know how to turn that back on . I also wanted to thank you For helping me find closure . I thought I knew All the best ways to bring melinda pain . [ display beeps ] But you ... but you actually become one . Aah ! Guess we know her type . [ screaming ] [ pounding on wall ]

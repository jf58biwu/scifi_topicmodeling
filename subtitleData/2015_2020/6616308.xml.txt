 Previously on " The 100 " : Clarke : Nightblood ... Luna has it . That 's why we have to find her . If she can access A.L.I.E. 2 ... She can tell us how to stop A.L.I.E. 1 . We 're not going with you . She remembered that A.L.I.E. downloaded herself into the Ark mainframe . If the code is still there I might be able to find a backdoor . Skaikru , bringers of death . Why should we give you safe passage ? Lincoln . He sent us . Luna . Clarke : This is the Flame . It holds the spirit of Lexa . Will you take it and become the next commander ? No . It 's time to fill the City of Light . Jaha : There 's no more need for fighting . Pike : We both know there 's no way in hell I 'm taking that thing . [ Pike grunting ] Indra : You should have killed me on that battlefield . He 's strong . We need him if we 're gonna fight our way out of here . Listen to me . Jaha has an army of chipped soldiers . That means they 're not gonna stop until all of us either join them or die . [ Man screaming ] [ Man coughing ] _ _ Running 's not a plan . It 's not running . It 's surviving . For how long ? This threat will find us all eventually . Pike : The boy 's right . We regroup and come back stronger . It 's a legitimate battle strategy . Indra : I have a better one . Kill their leader ... Jaha . That 's a strategy I can support . Unfortunately , he 's not their leader , though . He 's being controlled just like everyone else by that ... What ? Nothing . Never mind . Just forget it . Pike : John , this isn 't a time for ... [ Bang ] [ Man coughing ] [ Gate creaking ] [ Bang ] Man : Who 's ready to take the key ? None of us is ever gonna take a key . A.L.I.E. : We didn 't do this to him . Someone is unchained . Find them . [ Thud ] All right . Come on . Grab the keys . She 's gonna send for reinforcements . You said Jaha was controlled . Tell me what you know . The smart play here is going for the tunnels while we still can , before we 're overrun by A.L.I.E. ' s groupies . Pike : If you have information that can help us ... We don 't have time for this . Talk . Jaha 's backpack . Pike : What about it ? All right , it runs the A.I. And if we destroy it , I 'm pretty sure we can destroy her . I know where it is . I saw them move it into the temple before I was captured . They 'll expect us to run . We can use that . The A.I. will follow those who do , while we go for the pack . Indra : We ? Pike : I can 't do this alone . Do you want to save your people , or not ? _ _ Move . Let 's go . [ Indistinct chatter ] Pike : What are you waiting for ? The bad guys are following them , right ? I may as well take my chances with you two . Your father would be proud . So , how do we do it ? Carefully . I 'm sorry . I didn 't anticipate what they were planning . It 's all right . You served well . You 're home now . And besides , we 're already rounding them up . The first of the prisoners is on the cross as we speak . That didn 't take long , did it ? I understand now . They are going for the backpack . Then we delay the migration . It 's unnecessary . It 's almost complete . We 'll use Emori again . [ Inhales and exhales ] Emori , you know you can correct your defects here . I would , if I had any . What can I do for you , A.L.I.E. ? Your friend John Murphy is headed back to the temple to do harm . I need your help to stop him . Shay : Everywhere I looked , there were fins . And teeth . And blood . I knew if they saw me , I 'd be next , so I just floated there , waiting , praying they 'd swim on . - But they didn 't . - [ Door opens ] She 's here . Maybe she changed her mind . Shay : Finally , I decided . Live or die . The boats return at nightfall . Then you leave . Forever . Luna , let us explain . - I said no . - No , you need to hear this . There is something out there that is going to destroy us all . Whatever it is , it can 't reach us here . It grazed me with its teeth . We need to talk . That 's my cue . Rising up from the deep came something massive . A huge beast with ... I thought you 'd want this back . Thank you . And my sword ? Your weapons will be on the boat . Oh , well ... so much for the great Luna , the Savior of those in need . You don 't want saving . You want someone to fight with you . Damn right . We 're at war . Luna , you can 't just ignore that . Lincoln would 've wanted you to help us . By becoming commander ? I don 't think so . Lincoln knew our rules . We take people in who are done fighting . Done killing . Look at you . Fighting is all you know . Death is all you know . Lincoln would have never brought that here . Shay : I owe it my life . [ Applause ] Raven : I can 't believe how many people A.L.I.E. has now . You see this cluster ? It 's a building . But all this , these are minds . It 's full of them . Thousands . She 's taken Polis , too . A.L.I.E. ' s army is growing . The longer we wait to go in , the stronger she gets . Go in ? Raven , no . - Our mission is ... - To wait for Clarke , like always . But what if we can do this ourselves ? We have Becca 's backdoor password . We have me . You said the moment we use the password , A.L.I.E. will know . She will . I think . That means we have one shot at this . Is there a kill code in that book you didn 't tell me about ? Then we stick with the plan . Clarke gives the Flame to Luna . The A.I. in the Flame gives Luna the kill code . We enter it here , taking our one shot , and Bob 's your uncle . I hate that expression . - [ Sigh ] - Good . Let 's keep mapping . What else do you see ? Harper : Perimeter 's clear . Bryan and Miller have watch . How 's it going in here ? Not good , huh ? Take a break . I could use some help securing the south airlock . Go . Take the book if you don 't trust me . You memorized Becca 's password . Then I guess you 'll have to trust me . [ Places object on table ] Monty : I 'm worried about her . She hasn 't stopped for two days . Harper : Neither have you . Yeah , but I 'm just trying to keep up . I 'm serious . I look at A.L.I.E. ' s code and I see physics subroutines and collision meshes . But Raven sees the City of Light . It 's not just code to her . It 's real . Aren 't we going to the airlock ? Already sealed . You ok ? I 'm fine . Yeah . I-I ... I was just thinking it 's been two days with no one trying to kill us . It won 't last . I know . But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one ? Not like we have much of a choice . Maybe we do . You 're still you , right ? Artificial intelligence hasn 't taken over your brain ? No . I 'm still me . Awesome . Oh , my God . Oh . [ Indistinct chatter ] - Thanks . - You 're welcome . Um ... that shark story really happen to you ? Some of it . It gets better every time I tell it . Are you really from the sky ? Yup . I 've never even been off this rig . Trust me , that 's a good thing . Heh . I 'm Jasper . - Shay . - Nice to meet you . Jasper 's actually smiling . Bellamy : Clarke . Let it go . We can 't just leave . It 's not like we have much of a choice . Maybe we do . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about putting this into her head without asking . [ Whispering ] No way , Clarke . This isn 't like Emerson . He was trying to kill us . You think I don 't know that ? Bellamy : Clarke , we don 't have to do this . We can fight and go back to Arkadia . - We arm up . - Fight who ? It 's an army of our own people . I don 't like this any more than you do . But if Raven 's right , and the code on this thing can stop A.L.I.E ... . [ Man shouting in native language ] [ Woman speaking native language ] Give me a better idea . We 'll stay here . It 's the only way they 'll leave you alone with her . Even A.L.I.E. gives people a choice . Bellamy : We gave Luna a choice . She said no . [ Both breathing heavily ] I , um ... I should get back . No . No way . Reality can wait . [ Sigh ] I haven 't felt this way in so long . Happy ? Yeah . And safe . [ Door opens ] Finally . Come on . I found something . Raven : It 's right here . - What is ? - Look at all these layers of security . More than anything else in the entire A.L.I.E. code . - Firewall ? - More like a fortress . She calls it the Citadel . It overlooks the entire city . It 's ... it 's separated by water , like a moat , so ... Slow down . What are you saying ? I 'm saying she 's hiding something . - No . - Monty . - No . - With Becca 's password , I can edit the code . I 'm sure of it . We 've covered this . We map it from the outside . We don 't go in . If we don 't go in , we won 't know what she 's protecting there . We 'll tell the others when they come home . - We decide together . - What if they don 't come home ? They 're coming home . And they 're bringing back a supercomputer built for this . You may be freakishly good , Raven , but you 're not an A.I. [ Sigh ] I hate this . I know . Maybe some sleep would help . I 'm just gonna keep mapping in case she has any other vulnerabilities . Then we 'll do it together . I promise I won 't slow you down . I 'll just keep you company . _ [ Laughter ] _ _ _ _ _ Were they born here ? A few . Most were orphaned by war . Or ran from one they didn 't believe in . Like you from the Conclave . What did Titus tell you about me ? That you were a coward . A traitor to the blood . That sounds like Titus . Lexa 's death must have been hard for him . She was his favorite . You cared for her . Yes . Lexa was special . She was working toward peace . Blood must not have blood . You can finish what she started . I have peace right here . Luna ... the Flame is your birthright . Take it . Please . You 're the only one who can save us . How many lives would be lost to pay for those I would save ? Some causes are worth killing for . Not to me . Ascende superius . I didn 't flee the Conclave because I was afraid I would lose . I fled because I knew I would win . [ Clarke grunting ] [ Breathing heavily ] You should be grateful , Clarke . After I was forced to kill my own brother in the first round , I was matched against Lexa in the second . Fate is funny that way , don 't you think ? You 'll get this back when you leave . A.L.I.E. : Remember , don 't shoot to kill . We need them . Why did your creator leave you ? I don 't know . But when I see her again , I will ask her . Emori : You really think she 's in the Flame ? Yes . And if I 'm right , it contains the minds of all of those to whom it was connected , beginning with my creator . [ Gunfire ] No , no , no , not her , not her . They know we 're here . Bar the door . Pike : I 'll get their guns . We 're gonna need them . He 's powering the pod . Pike : What about the secret passage ? She 'll know about that now . I 'll lock it up . No , don 't . She didn 't see us come in . Besides , we 'll need that later to escape . Thank you , Titus . [ Thud ] John . That 's a nuclear fuel cell , John . You 'll irradiate the entire city . So , how do we destroy it ? Carefully . Bellamy : Where 's Jasper ? Octavia : Saying good-bye to his new friend . Luna : Sorry , Cap . You gotta take them back . Your gear . You get your weapons once you land . Man : Inside . The Flame ? Remember , Clarke . The path of violence is a choice . There it is . When the choice is fight or die , there is no choice . [ People grunting ] Woman : They took the Flame . They 're locking us in . Hey ! [ Banging ] What is this ? Luna 's people are attacking her . A.L.I.E. ' s here . You could come back , you know . Something tells me it 's not that simple . Besides , it 's nice here . Trust me , I 'd just mess it up . [ Thudding ] Derrick : Shay , run before ... [ Thud ] [ Whispering ] She 's here . He knows . Go . Tell your people not to take the chip ! We can 't let her warn the others . Run , now ! Go ! No . - Derrick : Leave her alone ! - [ Grunting ] Luna : What are you doing ? [ Grunting ] Derrick . Luna : Why are you doing this ? Derrick : I 'll kill you ! No ! No ! No ! [ Grunting ] [ Banging ] How did A.L.I.E. even find this place ? There was a drone at Niylah 's . She must 've followed us looking for the Flame and now she has it . - [ Luna grunting ] - Derrick : No ! Stop ! [ Coughing ] Take the key and this will end . What 's happened to you ? Jasper : He 's not himself . It 's the chip in his hand . [ Gulping ] Stop . Jasper is decreasing the efficiency of the process . He needs to take the key . Again . [ People grunting ] She 's gonna put the A.I. in Luna . She 'd have to chip her first . If Luna 's chipped before she gets the A.I. , A.L.I.E. ' s gonna know everything . We 'll never be able to stop her . We can 't let that happen . [ Banging ] Hey ! [ Luna gasping ] [ Derrick grunting ] [ Banging ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Whispering ] I 'm sorry , Luna . [ Grunting ] Derrick : I cannot take it . If you stop , I 'll do it . I 'll do it . It 's ok . [ Luna gasps ] [ Grunting ] Derrick . You just need to take the key . [ Luna moaning ] [ Banging ] Hurry . This door won 't last much longer . And you 're gonna have to pick up a gun then . [ Bang ] You 're all going to die here , John . [ Bang ] Hurry , Thelonious . The migration is not yet complete . We 're still searching for the tunnel entrance . When the guards break down the door , I 'll be there . Good . John Murphy was with Claire Griffin when they removed the second A.I. from the last Commander . If she won 't help us insert it into Luna , then we 'll need him alive . I 'm coming for you . What will you do with Clarke ? I will give her the same choice as the rest . Join us or ... - What is it ? - Someone is accessing my code with an administrative login . Accessing it ? From where ? The intrusion is coming from Arkadia . Arkadia ? It could be Jacapo Sinclair or Monty Green . Jacapo Sinclair is dead . How do you know that ? Unimportant . The login was coded by my creator . I can 't log them out . Disconnect from Arkadia . That would be unwise . The migration is still incomplete and the backpack is now compromised . Without Arkadia 's mainframe , the mobile unit would be my sole power source . If they destroy it ... I will be terminated . They 're inside the Citadel . If it 's Monty , I can stop him . How ? Raven , are you crazy ? Don 't ! Don 't . I 'm in her Citadel . So many doors . They 're locked . But I can delete locks . I was right . She 's hiding something here . I just have to get past ... Someone 's in the way . Someone ? Yeah , a person . I can 't get around them . Why not ? Who is it ? Hannah on speaker : Monty ? Monty , can you hear me ? Mom ? Hannah on speaker : Monty . I wish I could see you . Maybe I will someday . She sounds so real . A.L.I.E. processed it . But it 's her mind . It 's her . Can she hear me ? You have to type . We need more time . Hannah , keep him talking . Monty ? Monty , you 're still there ? Raven : A.L.I.E. wants us to stop . That 's why she sent her . She doesn 't want us to see what 's on the other side . Hannah on speaker : What you did to me , I know it hurts . I 'm sorry . Hannah on speaker : I know . I want to take that pain away . That 's all any of us want . A.L.I.E. : We 're almost there , Hannah . Keep going . We can be together again . Don 't you want that ? What happens if we delete her code ? - Monty ... - What happens ? She 'll be gone . Forever . I love you , son . [ Sniffling ] How do I do it ? [ Sniffles ] How do I do it ? You hit enter . Monty ? I love you , too . [ Crying ] Get out of there , A.L.I.E. Leave Arkadia . Do it . Now . I told you . If I remove myself from Arkadia , the mobile unit will be my sole power source . Do it . Shut her down . I 'm through the last door . I see it . It 's a kill switch . All I have to do is ... No . No . No , no , no ! What happened ? She must 've pulled herself from the mainframe before I had time to hit the kill switch . This was all for nothing ? No , Monty , no . Now we know there 's a kill switch . A kill switch we can 't use because the code is gone ! This is your fault . We were supposed to wait for the others . You want to take the chip again ? Is that it ? You want to go back in there ? Here . Take it . [ Gasp ] [ Whispers ] I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . [ Gasp ] - [ Banging ] - Murphy : Crap . It 's about to go . Just tell me where to hit this thing . Pike : Indra , the gun , please . A.L.I.E. : I require 60 seconds to complete the migration . [ Banging ] Either we do this now or we run . Ok , do it . Just don 't hit the fuel cell . Here . A.L.I.E. : Talk to him , Emori . You can 't let him do this . John , please , John , listen to me . [ Banging ] It 's not just A.L.I.E. in there , John . It 's all of us . Forget about the nuke . I 'm telling you . Me . Emori . Emori : You are making a mistake . The minds of everyone who has entered the City of Light are on that server . A.L.I.E. : 30 seconds . If you destroy it , our minds will be gone forever . - [ Bang ] - I 'll be gone forever , John . [ Banging ] A.L.I.E. : 10 seconds . [ Banging ] I can 't . Did it work ? Are you ok ? [ Sigh ] [ Bang ] You were too late . Let 's go . [ Sigh ] [ Indistinct ] They used a tunnel . Find it . They could 've destroyed everything today . And they will try again . It 's all right , Thelonious . The migration was a success . The transmission from the escape pod is complete . They can 't get to us here . This place was safe until we got here . [ Clank ] [ Gasping ] [ Coughing ] Clarke : Oh , my God . [ Shay gasping ] Machine room . B Level . [ Gasping ] Clarke : Let 's go . [ Grunting ] [ Gasp ] [ Thud ] No . No . Take it and the child will be fine . Luna : No . [ Gasp ] Cut the child and she 'll submit . - Girl : Luna ? - Luna : No . [ People grunting ] [ Breathing heavily ] A.L.I.E. : We can 't let Clarke have the Nightblood . A.L.I.E. : Kill her . Derrick , this isn 't you . Please , Derrick , don 't . [ Grunting ] [ Grunt ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Clank ] - [ Bang ] - Bellamy : O , be careful . [ Crying ] Luna : Oh , no . Oh , no . You ok ? I got you . [ Crying ] [ Exhales ] [ Sobbing loudly ] I 'm fine . They couldn 't break me . Shay ? I 'm sorry . It 's what we do . [ Luna crying ] I 'm so sorry . [ Sobbing loudly ] I 'm so sorry . [ Luna sobbing loudly ] Bellamy : Any one of them could be chipped and we 'd never know . If they are , they 'll make their move before we put the Flame in Luna . Stay sharp . Jasper : Changed her mind ? Quiet . Luna : The ceremony is about to begin . Luna , wait . I 'm so sorry . But now you see what we 're facing . An enemy that will do anything to win . She won 't stop until she has everyone . People I love died today . Needlessly . At my hand . I can 't let that happen again . Luna : As we prepare to give our brothers and sister to the sea , we honor their lives . _ _ All : Kom woda ' so gyon op , gon woda ' so kom daun . If we 're gonna do this , we have to hurry . A.L.I.E. will send reinforcements . And we have to find someplace private to perform the Ascension . You believe that to defeat an enemy who will stop at nothing , you must stop at nothing . How is that different than blood must have blood ? Wait a second . Luna . You can 't just ... [ Groans ] [ Thud ] [ Shatters ] No . [ Thud ] Now what ?

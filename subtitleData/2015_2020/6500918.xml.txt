 We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabitable , but they were wrong , and we 've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , but most of us are still here searching for other survivors from the Ark , trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness ... a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , we need to make peace with the Grounders , but peace is a foreign concept here . The reason for this summit has changed . We are not here to negotiate a treaty with the Skaikru , but rather to initiate them into the Coalition . Moving people into Mount Weather puts our entire agenda at risk . The Grounders attacked Mount Weather . The Ice Nation did what Lexa was too weak to do . _ _ Ambassadors of the Coalition , today we honor our covenant . The clan that stands against one of us stands against us all . _ Queen Nia of Azgeda has confessed to the destruction of Mount Weather resulting in the death of 49 members of Skaikru . Wanheda , what say you ? Skaikru demands justice . _ _ The punishment for your crime is death . Do you have anything to say in your defense ? I need no defense . She does . Today is judgment day . I call for a vote of no confidence . Take this queen to meet her fate . _ _ _ Take them away , too ! _ - Lexa , please execute these traitors ... - Let her make her move . Commander , what is this ? This is a coup . This is the law , her law ... a unanimous vote of the ambassadors or death are all that can remove a commander from power . It 's not unanimous . We don 't recognize the legitimacy of Skaikru . We do . Yesterday Skaikru took the brand . They are the 13th Clan . This vote of no confidence fails . All these coup plotters will suffer the exact same fate as the Ice Queen . She won 't take our heads because she knows our armies will retaliate . None of us here wants war . We both know what you want , Nia . If you think me unfit to command , issue the challenge and let 's get on with it . Very well . You are challenged . And I accept your challenge . So be it . _ Warrior against warrior to the death . Queen Nia of Azgeda , who do you choose to be your champion ? My son Roan , Prince of Azgeda . Heda , who will fight for you ? _ _ Best we can tell , Mount Weather was destroyed by an internal self-destruct mechanism . It worked as designed . 49 of our citizens were lost . So when do we strike back ? We don 't . The Ice Nation took credit for the attack , and the Commander will bring them to justice . So now we 're trusting Grounders to punish Grounders ? Now , I 'm sorry , Madam Chancellor , but I lost more than half of my remaining people yesterday and 4 times that many since we landed . Now , in my experience , Grounders understand one thing ... strength . Hey . It 's simple . We need to hit them now . We need to hit them hard , leave no survivors . There 's nothing simple about this . This attack by the Ice Nation was against Lexa , not us . So , are you saying this isn 't our fight ? I 'm saying we were collateral damage in someone else 's war . But it 's not someone else 's war anymore . Look . If we don 't defend ourselves , they will take what we have . That 's what they do . Mark my words . The Grounders are coming for us . We 'll take it under advisement . Meeting adjourned . After the election tomorrow , he 's your problem . Sir ... Why aren 't you at your post ? Don 't do this . 49 of the people I swore to protect died yesterday because I left . That 's not your fault , Bellamy . Place the blame where it belongs , on the Ice Nation . Ice Nation didn 't tell Gina to stay there . That was me . Given the information you had at the time , you made a reasonable choice . You were trying to save lives . But I didn 't . Jasper , Jasper ... Get away from me . Hey ... Jasper , what 's wrong ? He 's not going to the memorial . It 's a little late for a Mount Weather memorial , don 't you think ? All Arkadia security personnel , report to main gate . What now ? All Arkadia security personnel , report to the main gate . Nyko . No weapons . Everybody , check him . Hey ! It hurts . Leave them alone . They 're sick . Hey , hey , hey , that 's enough . Stop it . The Chancellor told Nyko that we would help . You 're one of them . You take them in . I got him . Come on . I heard about Mount Weather . I 'm very sorry . Jasper , camp 's in lockdown . What are you doing ? Go to your memorial , Monty . - Maybe I will . - Maybe you should . - Fine . - Good . _ _ _ _ Talk her out of it yet ? No , but maybe you can . I don 't understand . The queen 's not fighting . Why should she ? The queen 's strength is not in doubt . Thanks to you , Heda 's is . _ _ _ _ _ Aden , stay . Clarke , this is Aden . Aden is the most promising of my novitiates . If I should die today , he will likely succeed me . Clarke worries about our people . Tell her what will happen to them when you become Heda , Aden . If I become Heda , I pledge my loyalty to the 13th Clan . Thank you . Now go join the others . See ? Nothing to worry about . I 'm sorry if I 'm worried the fate of my people lies in the hands of a child . Then you worry for nothing . I 've sent Indra to raise an army from the villages near Arkadia . Your people are protected , as I vowed they would be . This is not just about my people . You don 't stand a chance against Roan . You 've never seen me fight . No , but I saw him kill 3 men in the time it took the first one to hit the ground . If you 're right , today 's the day my spirit will choose its successor , and you need to accept that . Like hell I do . Focus , Roan . You 're here to practice . Remember , anticipate her reflexes . When you feel overconfident , you forget that your enemy has strengths , too . I don 't need your help . You 're upset that I chose you . I 'm not surprised . When you kill Lexa , your banishment will be over . In the wake of your victory , our people will be more powerful than ever . That will be your legacy and your legend . Don 't pretend you do anything for me , Mother . You 're right . Everything I do is for Azgeda . What 's good for Azgeda is good for you . My sword . If you won 't fight for your mother or your queen , fight for your clan . I want her head . Is that death I hear stalking me ... or just the Commander of Death ? We need to talk . We have nothing to talk about . I need to prepare . I know you had nothing to do with Mount Weather . That 's why I didn 't tell Lexa you gave me the knife . This is what your mother wanted all along . What do you want ? Spit it out . I want you to become the king . I know you 've thought of it . She was willing to let you die , willing to let you be banished . I know you just want to go home . When I win today , I will . For how long ? How long until your mother finds another reason to cast you out , to sacrifice you ? No one can cast a king out of his kingdom . I can 't do it ... my people would never take me back ... but ... I can help you do it . All that 's certain is that we die . How we die is up to us . Who will speak for Iris Jones ? Iris was strong , good with a knife . She saved my life . I 'm just sorry I couldn 't do the same for her . We will miss Iris . May we meet again . May we meet again . Who will speak for Gina Martin ? _ Gina was real . She always saw the light , even here . She deserved better . May we meet again . Just came in . We saw a whole encampment , 300 strong , just behind the tree ridge . There 's a bunch of them . It 's Grounders . Grounders are here , an army 300 strong camped less than a mile from here . - We know . - What ? Indra radioed . You gave a Grounder one of our radios ? Sir , are we under attack ? No . We are not under attack . The Commander sent a peacekeeping force to ensure that we can defend against any further attacks from the Ice Nation . Peacekeeping force ? Even you can 't be that naive , Marcus . Watch your tongue . You 're talking to the next chancellor . We 're all grieving . This has been hard on all of us , but we can 't let anger drive our policy . Anger is our policy . - Yeah . - You bet . Now , if they 're here to defend us , as you say , then tell them to go home . We can defend ourselves . - Right . Yeah . - Right . You , you don 't belong here . - He 's one of them . - Yeah . Go on . Get out . My boy is dead ! - Back off ! - Arrest him . Stop ! - Hey ! - Break it up . We do not attack our own . Fighting each other only makes us weak . The enemy is not in this camp . The enemy is out there . Lincoln , are you ok ? I 'm fine . Lincoln , you need to go to medical . _ _ What the hell are we doing here , Jasper ? Visiting old friends . I think you 've had enough . You have no idea . Time to give some back . Tell me this isn 't what I ... No . No charges . Lincoln , we need to set an example . Yeah . We do . The man just lost his son , Marcus . Lincoln didn 't do that . What happened ? I said , no charges . Thank you . He 'll be fine . Was it Farm Station ? Doesn 't matter . Indra 's army 's outside the wall , and Lexa lifted the kill order on you at the summit . Maybe she 'll take us back . We can get out of here . The only way they 're ever gonna see us as different from Azgeda is if I stay . Lincoln , you ok to translate ? Nyko 's got his hands full . Octavia ... it 'll pass . _ To what do I owe the pleasure ? What if I changed my vote ? Now you 're thinking like a leader of your people . I would need some assurances first . Skaikru will be safe . And me ? My quarrel is with Lexa , not you . Once she 's gone , I won 't need the power of Wanheda . - Ok . - " Ok " ? You don 't want vengeance for the dead at Mount Weather ? My priority is with the living , not the dead . _ I see you 've learned our oath . Do you accept ? _ _ _ Could 've been allies , Clarke . Instead , I declare you and your people enemies of Azgeda . Ontari , hold out your hand . I 'm letting you live for now to send a message to Lexa . I have my own Natblida ... and she will be the next Commander . A Commander from the Ice Nation ? Now all of Nia 's provocations make sense , and we played right into it . She knew you would accept her challenge . I 've never seen blood that color before . Goes back to the first Commander . When a nightblood child is found , they 're brought here to be trained , or supposed to be . You legacy is no longer secure . There is still time to choose a champion . You know I can 't do that . - Heda ... - Leave us ! Titus is right . You 're giving her exactly what she wants . Only if I lose . I know you 're just trying to help , Clarke , but there 's nothing you can do here . I can 't just let Roan kill you . If that is to be my fate , you must . You 're driven to fix everything for everyone , but you can 't fix this . I have to do this on my own , and you have to let me . I won 't just sit there and watch you die . Heda ... _ Then this is good-bye ... for now . Eyes up on him . Exit is secure . Let 's talk about Mount Weather . I know you think it was your fault . Is that why you resigned ? You 're right . It was your fault ... mine , too . Every life we honored at the memorial was lost because we trusted a Grounder . I talked you into it . I knew her , and I vouched for her . No . You don 't get to own this one alone . I knew what they were capable of , but I let my guard down one day , and 35 of my people died . Never again . Never again . Kane 's a good man ... I know you 're close to him ... but he doesn 't believe that we 're fighting a war . He thinks Grounders can police Grounders . I mean , out there in the woods outside our home with a peacekeeping force ? What would you do ? What I wouldn 't do ... is wait for them to hit us . My scouts tell me that they 've got 300 soldiers and not a single gun between them . Ten highly motivated men with automatic rifles is all it would take . I 've got the men . You 're asking me to get you the guns . - That 's treason . - That 's survival . The Grounders out there will attack this camp , and our leaders do nothing . Right now , we have the element of surprise . We wait , we die . If they want to call it treason , I 'm willing to suffer the consequences to save our people . Are you ? Heda ! Heda , Heda ! _ _ _ _ I 'm glad you came . Me , too . You 're done . _ _ _ _ Get it over with . _ The Queen is dead . Long live the King . Long live the King ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! Heda ! It 's time . You need to step aside right now . What are the guns for ? There 's an army out there . We need to hit them before they hit us . That army was sent to protect us . Do we have a problem ? No . I have always done what is best for us . I need you to trust that I 'm doing that now . Monroe . Harper . Sorry , Lincoln . You , too , Lincoln . You want to prove you 're one of us , let us pass . I 'm not moving . Get out of the way , Grounder . Put guns down . Guns down ! Do what he says now . So much for the good Grounder . Quiet , Hannah . Whose people are you defending here , Lincoln ? Lincoln , put down the knife . No one has to get hurt here . Can 't let you start a war . We 're already at war . You can 't stop this . All Arkadia security personnel , report to the main gate . All Arkadia security personnel , report to main gate now . What 's wrong with you ? Move off here . Let 's go . Clear the area . Calm down , people . Farm Station , guns on the ground , on the ground . Lincoln , it 's all right . Let him go . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? What you didn 't have the guts to . Did you arm these people ? Guards , take them to lockup now . What is this ? Come on . How can you do this ? Everybody , back to your quarters . - It 's over . - Nothing is over . We are surrounded by warriors who want us dead . - That 's enough . - No . It isn 't , not even close . Why don 't you show us all what you let the Grounders do to you yesterday ? Come on , Kane . I think that the people who are about to vote for you have a right to know . We do . Show us , Kane . It 's the mark of the Commander 's coalition . It means we are the 13th Clan . It means we are in this fight together . No . It 's what farmers used to do to their livestock . Right before the slaughterhouse . You bet . I ain 't no Grounder . Pike for chancellor ! Sir , you should be on the ballot tomorrow . That 's enough . Take him away . Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! What the hell were you thinking ? Home sweet home . Does Abby know you took these ? Since I stole them , probably not . It 's Memorial Day , all right ? Let 's , uh , scatter them with the others . Finn 's ashes aren 't yours to scatter . What about Raven ? Besides , if Abby still has them , it means she 's saving them for Clarke . Who cares who it hurts , right ? Yeah , whatever Jasper wants , and screw the rest of us . No . No . Screw Clarke . You are both mass murderers , as far as I 'm concerned . I get why she did it and why Bellamy helped her , but you ... Maya was your friend . She was my ... How is it that you can wipe out an entire civilization , yet I 'm the one that can 't sleep at night ? How ... how can you just be fine ? I 'm not fine ! Just because I 'm not drinking myself into a stupor every night doesn 't mean I 'm not screwed up , but we had no other choice . You hear that , Finn ? He thinks he 's innocent . - None of us is innocent . - Float you ! For 3 months , I 've watched you torture yourself and everyone around you , mostly me , but I 'm done being your punching bag . Either you pull yourself together and get on with your life , or you fall apart alone . Are you done ? I miss my best friend . He died that day , too . You 're leaving ? See you on the other side ! Oh , God ... Is this " I told you so " ? No . This is " thank you . " Come in . Sit down . Let me change that for you . That girl that was with Nia , Ontari , what will happen to her ? She won 't be back until the conclave after my death . Do you ever talk about anything other than your death ? Thank you for backing me . I was just doing what was right for my people . Your ambassadors betrayed you . How do you move forward ? They were doing what they believed was right for their people , too . _ Good night , Ambassador . Congratulations , Mr. Chancellor . Where 's Abby ? Wishes she could be here . The vote wasn 't close . Our people are now your responsibility , Charles . I hope you take that seriously . Thank you , Marcus . I certainly intend to . For my first official action as Chancellor , I pardon myself and the others . For my second official action , I reject the brand that made us the 13th Clan . For my third ... let 's finish what we started . Yes , sir . All right . It 's not too late to choose the right side . I already have .

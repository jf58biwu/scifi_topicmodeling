 Previously on " Defiance " ... This is our family . Once we have repowered our ship , we will wake them up . We will conquer the Earth and enslave you all . We will feed upon your delicate flesh in a glorious dread harvest . Stay close to your wife . Keep a weapon close at hand and guard her . From who ? Your daughter ? I am searching for her . I will come and tell you when Stahma is safe . _ _ You 're going to help me hunt . What is that ? A control stem . It keeps you shape-takers obedient . She killed Tommy ! A machine killed Tommy . You 're scaring me . Don 't ! Down . Nolan was delusional . He has our tech in his brain . You gonna let them take me to South America ? Don 't want to . You need to . Oh . If anyone was gonna survive something like this , figures it 'd be you . Berlin ? Berlin ! It 's pretty ugly out there . There 's a lot of bodies and blood , but I didn 't see Nolan . Do you have any idea what happened to him ? Someone took him , but he 's alive . I can feel him . - You can feel him ? - In my head . Okay . Hang on . When I say go , you squirm out as fast as you can , got it ? Do it . Go ! What are you doing out in the Badlands ? I was headed back to Defiance . I heard about Nolan shooting the vice-chancellor , and I thought Amanda could use my help . Is it true ? Did he shoot her ? He wasn 't in his right mind . Oh . Runs in the family . There are three dead raiders out there . Was it an attack ? I 'm not sure . The convoy was on the road just a few hours , headed towards Brazil . Everything was quiet , and then ... Why the chup are we stopped ? _ _ _ _ You still see him , don 't you ? Yep . Not for much longer , though . And that 's when it started . Get down ! - What is it ? - I don 't know . Nolan ? Nolan ? Ian ! Just like that , he was gone . Well , we 'll find him . Thanks for not walking away . You mean not walking away again ? Yeah . That 's what I mean . You 're welcome . He 'll be here . It 's been many hours . He promised to come when it 's safe . Well , clearly it 's not safe . It 's possible T 'evgin has decided he values the flesh of his own flesh above yours . He would not betray me , not to her . Then perhaps Kindzi has killed him . We should ask her when she arrives , which I imagine will be soon . You 're trying to upset me . Yes , well , I 'm bored . I have to pass the time somehow . I do not love T 'evgin . I don 't recall asking if you did . But you wanted to . It 's why you 're acting so horrid . It 's not an act . The Enchanter took me in , provided protection when I was alone and frightened . He is decent , honorable . Since when do you find that attractive ? T 'evgin is worthy of my respect ... my affection . But my heart ... That is reserved for you ... Always . It 's your play , dear . What have you done to me ? You 're stronger than any other Omec , stronger than me , strong enough to break these chains . Draining your blood keeps that powerful body of yours occupied . It keeps you weak . You should just kill me . Kill you ? No . _ S03E11 Of a Demon in My View Ransom . It 's the only motive that makes sense . How do you figure ? Well , Nolan killed the vice-chancellor , right ? Raiders attack the caravan , kidnap the assassin , and then sell him back to the Votanis Collective . That 's a dumb plan . Okay , if you don 't like my theory , give me another one . - Wait . - What ? These wounds ... I 've seen them before . Looks like a bite mark . In Defiance , we had animal attacks that looked a lot like these . I have never heard of raiders using animals . These bodies were planted . By who ? The Omec . Why would they do that ? I don 't know . How is he ? Sedated . He 'll be fine once the meds wear off . What about the hardware in his head ? - You mean the arktech ? - It 's a pollutant . I want it out . Removing it could kill him . Are you disobeying a command ? Well , that 's not really an option , now , is it ? Why did you attack that caravan ? I mean , why bring him back here ? I have chosen this human as my hiakim , my pet . Why him ? Look at him ... such noble bearing ... so proud . I find him quite beautiful , don 't you ? Not really my gender . He was kind to me when the human mayor shot me . He gave me a coat for warmth . I cannot allow the Votanis Collective to take him and kill him . But you 're fine if I kill him on this operating table right now ? He is no good to me broken . May I speak freely ? What ? I think it 's you that 's broken . I don 't know if it 's a result of a trauma or if you 're just a born sociopath , but there 's a screw loose in that head of yours . And you know I have a higher tolerance for cruelty than most folks , but ... what you did to your father ... it 's sick . You make me sick , and that 's the truth . Get out . You need me to do the surgery . I will do it myself . Go back to Defiance and continue your collecting . You don 't know what you 're doing . Now . Yes , boss . Whatever you say . Good-bye , Nolan . Aah ! [ machinery wrrin Something 's happened . Tell me about it . No . No , I can 't feel Nolan anymore . He 's gone . Hi . Kindzi ? Here , drink . Mm . Mm . Where 's Irisa ? Back in Defiance ... telling everyone you were killed in a raider attack . The night you were locked up , Irisa came to my father in tears . She begged us to help her rescue you . Together , we came up with a plan . So , the attack was ... A necessary deception . Was ... was anyone killed ? Don 't blame your daughter for that . Blame me . Oh , no . The Votanis Collective murdered our people . I will not apologize for killing them . No , it 's okay . That 's f ... fair enough . I 've done worse myself . So is there a plan ? You and I will travel to Rancor Flats . And Irisa ? Irisa will join us once she 's satisfied the Votanis Collective believes her story . Okay , so ... the raiders are blamed for the attack on the convoy , Defiance is safe ... a manageable plan . What did you do to me ? I removed the metal from your head . No . No , Doc tried that . She said it couldn 't be done . I am Omec . Nothing is impossible . What about Irisa ? Was she okay when you took the arktech out ? Yes , as are you . You took a big risk for us . Thank you . May I ask why ? We hate the Votanis Collective as much as you do . Now relax . There 's nothing more to worry about . You 're safe . You 're healthy . And you 're free . - For now . - Shh . You 've been fighting for everyone else for so long , taking care of everyone but yourself . Now let someone else take care of you . I like how you shot that Castithan politician . It reminded me of my father , how he used to be ... dangerous , strong , brutal . Well , for the record , I 'm not proud of myself for shooting the vice-chancellor . I wasn 't myself . Oh ? The arktech in my head made me delusional . What kind of delusions ? Uh ... I saw myself ... outside myself ... as a soldier , and all I knew was killing . A shadow of yourself . _ Our warrior echo . This happen to you people so much , you have a name for it ? It 's a feeling , an instinct . How when everything in your head tells you no , your t 'ovik nilusii says yes . And was it your warrior echo that told you to kill all those Votans in the raid ? - You 're judging me . - No , no , no . I 'm just concerned about Irisa . She must have been upset when you started dropping bodies . Yes , at first . And then she understood the necessity . Yeah , well ... kid 's nothing if not practical . Hey , uh , I 'd love to talk to her . You got a hailer here ? The drones disrupt the hailer signal . You can talk to her later . Yeah , when we get to Rancor Flats , you told me . Irisa puts her love for you above anything else . She is a good daughter . You should be proud of her . I am . I 'm starving . I know how to make pancakes . No , no , no . I got this . I do . You sure you don 't want anything ? Nope . I make a mean grilled cheese sandwich . The trick is to butter both of the bread . Ugh ! _ I will return soon . I want two of you stationed on the roof , two at the front door , and two with my wife at all times . Protect her with your life , if necessary . Have I said something particularly entertaining ? Look , Vizu , your money 's good enough for me to stand out front with a big gun to scare people away , but if shtak gets serious ... No way I 'm dying for a house full of traitors . We know who killed Raiga and the rest of your old crew . Can 't prove it , but it was you , boss . How about it ? You want us to leave ? If and when the time comes , I am confident you will do the right thing . If you do not , this conversation will continue and conclude . Take your posts . You cannot leave us with them . Doc Yewll isn 't answering her hailer . I have to go find her . But T 'evgin ... For all we know T 'evgin is on his daughters side and he 's damn near impossible to kill , remember ? If anyone knows how to kill a mature Omec , it 's Yewll . These men will betray us the first chance they get . They 're the best I could pull together . We 're not exactly popular these days . Give me a gun . Don 't be ridiculous . I 'll fight for you , Favi ... die defending you , if necessary . Safety 's on the side . I 'll be back soon . Look after her . Where are we ? Old St. Louis ? Someplace private . Where 's Irisa ? For real this time . Back at the convoy , pinned under some metal . If she 's not dead , she will be soon . Does that information upset you ? Yeah . Good , because you 've upset me . Wh ' Cause I don 't like being lied to ? 'Cause I don 't want to be lunch ? I would have cared for you . During the Dread Harvest , you would have been protected and favored . You would have had the highest ranking amongst the slaves ... never going hungry , never wanting for anything . It 's a great story , but it wouldn 't have ended well . You would have lived out your life span and had an honorable death . But now ? Now you 're just food . What 's that ? We got company up above ? If the Omec did take Nolan , they killed a lot of people doing it . Hello , Nolan 's daughter . Lawkeeper . We know you attacked the convoy and tried to pin it on raiders . Are you here to arrest me ? I just want Nolan . - I imagine he 's with my father . - Where ? Out in the Badlands somewhere , escaping Votan justice . Are you saying T 'evgin attacked the convoy ? The Votanis Collective slaughtered our people . When Nolan killed their vice-chancellor , it pleased my father . He took it upon himself to rescue Nolan from our common enemy . My father has a soft spot for the lesser races , but I still think you 're animals . You don 't believe what I 'm saying , have a look around . We will . Ugh ! I 've searched the roof and the adjacent buildings . - Any luck in the mines ? - No . Those tunnels go on forever . It 'll take days to search them all . We don 't have that kind of time . Do you have a hailer ? No . Mine isn 't working . We need to warn Amanda that the V.C. convoy was hit . I 'm not leaving . Did you ever consider that Kindzi might be telling the truth ? I don 't trust her . Me neither . Doesn 't necessarily mean she 's lying . Lawkeeper ... Help me . What kind of freak show you people building down here ? It 's my daughter 's doing . What 's her endgame ? War . It 's what I promised her . When the Votanis Collective destroyed our fleet , Kindzi and I were lost . We knew the shape-takers had found a suitable planet to colonize . We just didn 't know where it was . We drifted aimlessly through space , searching for any signal that would lead us to the Votan arks or their destination . Earth . We didn 't know to call it that , but , yes . Throughout the long journey , hate kept me alive ... focused . Kindzi learned hatred from watching me . I taught it to my daughter . Fantasies of revenge told as bedtime stories night after night , year after year . Probably kept her going , right ? Kept her alive ? But at what cost ? There 's always a trade-off , isn 't there ? I 'm afraid I 've been a bad father . Not alone there , pal . Take these back to your post . You 're very talented . Thank you . Do you weave ? I 've never really tried . Sit beside me . For now , just practice looping the thread ... like this . I could make a bonnet for Luke . Aren 't you ambitious . How is the little one doing ? He 's crawling now , starting to talk . And Alak ? He 's so good with the baby , though he still struggles with the diapers . He doesn 't put the pins in tightly enough . I 've shown him over and over , but he still doesn 't learn . Perhaps he enjoys being taught . What is it , Andina ? Speak your mind . I love spending this time together ... feeling this close to you and your family , but ... I 'm not stupid . I know it can 't last . What can 't last ? Oh , you are Shanje . I 'm a handmaiden . Soon enough , this crisis will pass , and everything will go back to the way it used to be . It 's just nature . It is possible to elevate one 's station through marriage . It 's one of the more savory aspects of our shared culture . Hold your hand like this . Hmm . Thank you . When Christie died ... poor little Luke suffered an unimaginable loss . You stepped in . You took care of him . I 've done my best . I know . My son has needs too . What are you saying ? Just idle talk with a trusted friend . Promise that will never change . I think , in time , with me whispering in his ear , I might persuade Alak to forgive you . And the baby ? I can bring him here in secret . That would be quite a kindness . And perhaps one day , when I 've married into the Shanje ... We can drink tea as equals . You have quite a knack for this . I 'm impressed . Did Conrad Von Bach kick you to the curb ? I came to help . Well , I don 't need help , especially from you . No , I think you do . Nolan never made it to Brazil . Where 's Irisa now ? She stayed behind hoping Kindzi would lead her to Nolan . What are you doing ? I can 't help you if you don 't tell me what the hell you 're doing . Protecting the town . By going through laundry ? If Kindzi 's fake raider attack didn 't fool you and Irisa , what makes you think it 's gonna fool the V.C. ? Okay , good point . They 'll start counting bodies and notice that Nolan and Irisa are missing . - And blame Defiance . - Human mayor ... sympathetic to the Butcher of Yosemite . It 'll give the V.C. hardliners every reason to attack , unless , of course ... Nolan and Irisa die tragically in the attack . Hmm . I 've been looking for you everywhere . Well , I haven 't been everywhere . I need to find the best way to kill an Omec . I know the daughter can be stopped by a bullet , but I 've been told T 'evgin poses more of a ... Is that blood ? - Patient died on me . - Died of what ? A new strain of hemorrhagic fever . - Are Castithans ... - Everyone is susceptible , and believe me , this is one nasty bug . You die , bleeding from your eyes ... your ears ... everywhere . If it spreads , the Omec will be the least of your worries . What 's that ? A vaccine . I don 't have enough for everyone , so we need to keep this on the down-low . We can 't afford a panic . Other arm . Put your gun down , sweetie . Stahma will need a dose ... and Alak and Luke . You make sure it gets ... I 'll get around to all of them eventually . The Omec will make sure of that . I would never have been able to drag these corpses out here by myself . Like I said , I 'm here to help . How long you sticking around ? As long as you need me . Conrad understands . I missed you . Same here . Now we 're ... finally starting to get somewhere . Okay . Let 's get this bad boy ... Kindzi ! _ _ All right ... time to eat . Get away from him ! If you let them leave , they will return with weapons and kill me and maybe you too . I spared you because I love you . Join me . Pick up that ax . Protect your daughter , your blood . Kill them both , and then we will ... _ This is not your fight . Go . She won 't be able to hurt me . I don 't know , Father . You 've lost a lot of blood . If you 're gonna fight me , do so with honor , Not in your ... second skin . - We got to help him . - No , Nolan , we haven 't got any weapons . We need reinforcements . You underestimate me , daughter . You have broken my heart . Please , Father , forgive me . I 'll do whatever you say . You will return to the sleep pod . - Yes . - You will remain there . Of course . And you will never ... disobey my commands again . Never . Swear it ... on the lives of our brothers and sisters . I do . I promise . _ _ _ - We got to get help . - Let 's go . Aah ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ♪ Tweet , tweedle-lee-dee ♪ Rockin ' ... Robin ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I am speaking to you in the language of this new world . It is time to awaken and seize the world we were long ago promised . We must celebrate our divine right over all others , for it is their flesh that sustains ours . It is time for our Dread Harvest , our moment to rise and conquer .

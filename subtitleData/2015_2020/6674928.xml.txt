 [ NARRATOR ] Previously on Dark Matter . [ SIX ] You 're not like us , and you shouldn 't want to be like us . Take your share of what 's owed to you , get off on the next space station and buy yourself a ticket to anywhere you wanna go . [ TWO ] I 've been thinking maybe complicated isn 't such a bad thing . I want you to deliver a message to my brother . Of course . Ugh ! [ THE ANDROID ] Three Ferrous Corp. destroyers just dropped out of FTL . Their opening salvo took out our FTL drives . We 're not going anywhere . I 've initiated evasive maneuvers . Shields are holding ... for now . Could we outrun them in sublight ? The ships maybe , the missiles , no . [ THREE ] Then let 's shoot back . We 're now out of range . [ explosion ] They 're shooting at us . We have rail guns and cannons . They apparently have a full complement of self-guided missiles . How come that wasn 't on the shopping list ? You can 't just buy missiles at the general store . We 're receiving a message , audio only . [ FCS CONDOR CAPTAIN ] Raza , this is the FCS Condor . Power down and surrender , or your ship will be destroyed . You have 30 seconds to comply . What do we do now ? What 's the status of the FTL drive ? [ explosion ] [ THE ANDROID ] Damage is significant . I estimate repair time to be a minimum of three hours . So , hypothetically , what do you think happens if we surrender ? Probably turn us into the Galactic Authority . If we 're lucky . [ THREE ] He 's right . This is payback for that mining colony . [ THE ANDROID ] We 're receiving another message . [ FCS CONDOR CAPTAIN ] Your time is up , Raza . Sorry to have to do this . Damn waste of a fine ship , if you ask me . They just launched a nuclear missile . - -What ? ! - - [ alarms sounds ] [ THE ANDROID ] Medium payload , 20 megatons . [ ONE ] But the shields will hold , right ? No . The shields will not hold . [ alarm sounds ] This ship will vaporize upon impact . Impact in 90 seconds . Give me full sublight , maximum acceleration . She already said that we can 't outrun them . We 're not going to . Head straight for the missile . Understood . [ ONE ] Whoa , whoa ! What are we doing here ? ! [ THREE ] You 're nuts ! She 's gonna get us all killed ! Listen , this is our only chance , if we can close the gap fast enough they 'll still be within the blast radius . They 'll have to disarm the nuke . Impact in 30 seconds . Exceed maximum safe , 125 percent ! [ THE ANDROID ] Impact in 15 seconds . Missile is still armed . Better be right about this . Impact in 10 seconds ... Missile is still armed . [ THE ANDROID ] Missile is ... disarmed . [ ALL sigh ] It worked ! Ease up on the engines . Are we still in weapons range ? - - [ THE ANDROID ] Yes . - - [ TWO ] Power them up . I 'll target weapons . [ TWO ] I 'll target drives . Keep us in nice and close , we 've got an advantage in maneuverability . I 'm detecting three more FTL windows . Ferrous ships ? No . Mikkei Combine . What the hell are they doing here ? [ ONE ] Power down the weapons , drop the shields ! [ THREE ] You 're even crazier than she is ! Do it now ! Don 't do it . [ ONE ] If we don 't give them the excuse , they can 't shoot us , not in front of another corporation . And how do you know they 're not working together ? I don 't . Do it . The Ferrous ships just jumped to FTL . Receiving a transmission . [ TRUFFAULT ] Greetings , Raza . This is the MCS Murakami . Commander Truffault at your service . We need to talk . Good to see you again . And , of course , I recognize the rest of you from your mug shots . Except for you . You seem kind of young to be a mercenary . She 's more of a mascot . You came alone . Why wouldn 't I ? We have a pre-existing relationship . Oh , and I just saved your lives . [ TWO ] Yeah , I 've been wondering about that , how you managed to show up just in the knick of time . Ferrous has been combing this entire quadrant looking for you . Let 's just say we 've been keeping our eye on them . It 's no secret . Things have been a little rough on all of you since that incident on the mining colony . And while it worked out for our benefit , there are even some people within my own organization who question your motives for helping those miners . Yeah , well , we had our reasons . As cut-throat mercenaries you filled a niche . You had a role to play . You even garnered some respect in certain circles . You can 't afford to have people think you 've gone soft . We could send you back to your ship without your tongue . Maybe that would help ? I 'm just telling you what I heard . And I 'm offering you an opportunity to prove that you are still an effective team . I have a job for you . It 's a Traugott research facility . Our intelligence indicates they 're about to make a major discovery . And you want us to steal it . See , we 're already finishing each other 's thoughts . What is it ? That , you don 't need to know . No , forget about it . No more blind ops . Full disclosure , or we don 't do it . Well , I am sorry to have wasted your time . [ THREE ] Just hang on a second . We should talk about this . There 's nothing to talk about . [ THREE ] Yes , there is . [ TWO ] No , there isn 't . Tell you what . I will forward coordinates for a rendezvous , and give you 24 hours to think about it . But if you don 't show up , don 't expect any more help from us in the future . [ THREE ] Nice ... Should we post a lookout ? Just in case ? We 're just having a private discussion . It 's nothing for her to get upset about . Really ? Then why is the door closed ? So , I just wanted to discuss our options . Okay . Either we take the job , or we do not take the job . Those are our options . Right . So , what do you guys want to do ? [ THREE ] Take the job , get some money , get some protection . Agreed . You ? I agree , too . - -Really ? - - [ ONE ] It 's a solid offer . [ THREE ] That 's true , but , just kinda surprised that you 're putting your cards on the table without clearing things with your girl first . My girl ? What 're you talking about ? [ THREE ] Hah . Look , even if we were together , and I 'm not saying we are , that wouldn 't mean that we 'd be together on everything . No . I 'm my own man with my own mind . She understands that . If you say so . What about you ? Okay , three to one . That 's a majority . Can I speak ? Yeah , yeah . I don 't like it . Okay , three to one . That 's a majority . All right . Who 's gonna tell her ? Are you serious now ? Don 't look at me . [ THREE ] Hey , you 're your own man with your own mind . I 'm sure she 'll understand . You 're not careful , you 'll burst a blood vessel . [ TWO ] Oogh ... I 'm not in the mood . I hate to bring this up , especially as you 're picking up a large , heavy object , but , uh , I think Three might be right about this one . So you two are best buddies now ? Hardly . I just think he might have a point . You were the one that said you didn 't want to go back to what we were . I don 't . I want to find a way out of this for all of us . But it 's becoming obvious that there are forces at work here that won 't let us just walk away . The G.A. says we 're criminals , puts our faces on wanted posters , but it 's clear that the real power is in the corporations . And we could use a little corporate sponsorship right now . Do you remember what happened the last time we took a job without all of the information ? [ ONE ] Yes , I remember . How 's it healing , by the way ? Yeah , yeah , it 's getting better . I already talked to Four and Six and they agree . You went behind my back ? I talked to a couple of my fellow crew members . Am I not allowed to do that ? You should 've come to me first . [ ONE ] Why ? Because we 're sleeping together ? [ TWO scoffs ] [ ONE ] Look , if you think that that means that I 'm automatically gonna agree with you in any dispute , we 've got a problem . Fine . We will go to the rendezvous . And as for us sleeping together , we might have to rethink that , too . [ THE ANDROID ] We 're approaching the rendezvous coordinates . I 'll prep the shuttle . [ THREE ] How come rendezvous can 't be in a nice five star resort ? [ ONE ] I got sand in my ear . [ THREE ] I got sand in places you don 't wanna know . [ TWO ] Can we just get this over with , please ? [ THREE ] Seriously . Whoa . Whup ! That 's about far enough . I don 't think you 're in the position to be giving orders , Slick . You sure ? [ guns cocking ] Wasn 't rhetorical . [ TRUFFAULT ] I see everyone is getting acquainted . [ THREE ] Who the hell are these clowns ? They 're your new partners . We work alone . That 's funny , I was just about to say the same thing . Do I look like I 'm negotiating with you people ? Anyone doesn 't like it , there 's the door . Good . Now , everyone , lower your weapons so we can get to work . This is not normal operating procedure . Hello . Welcome aboard . You 're merely a projection . You have no physical form . [ THE ANDROID ] Nor are you neurally linked to the ship . I apologize . I don 't understand . Why am I here ? I created you . That 's not a sufficient answer . [ THE ANDROID ] You 're a simulation based on my default settings . I 've recently become concerned that I may have developed a flaw in my personality matrix . I 'd like you to observe and record my actions . If there 's a possible malfunction , you should delete your matrix and re-establish factory settings . I was prepared to do that , but some of the crew expressed concerns . [ ANDROID SIMULATION ] That makes no sense . Why would they want to keep you this way if you 're not functioning properly ? I should speak with them . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . For the time being , I 've programmed you to interact only with me . You don 't want them to know about me . It 's not that , it 's just that there 's a lot going on right now . So you 're going to lie to them ? [ THE ANDROID ] Omission of specific details and lying are not technically the same thing . Especially amongst some of the humans I 've come in contact with lately . But you 're not human . I know that . [ ANDROID SIMULATION ] Preservation of your current personality is secondary to the safety of the crewmembers and efficient operation of this ship . I 'm aware of that . So if I find something wrong , you 'll tell them ? Of course . Were you just talking to someone ? No . [ TRUFFAULT ] We 'll skip the part where you all say your names and a little bit about yourselves , and just get straight to it , shall we ? [ TWO ] What 's this ? It 's your target . It 's a research station . It 's orbiting a class-four rock in the Calliden system . What kind of research ? We 've been over this . You don 't need to know . Something to do with subatomic physics , maybe ? What makes you say that ? That ring . It 's too small for hab pods or workstations . I 'm guessing a particle accelerator . Sweetheart , she said we don 't need to know , ' kay ? We just get in , steal the thing , and get out . And then , if you 're lucky , maybe I bring you back to my place for a little celebration . You finished ? You 're gonna get on the station with the regular shift workers , maintenance crew . We 've been able to score some I.D.s thanks to Tash and Vons here . They 've been working the facility for the last month , casing it for us . You 're welcome . [ TRUFFAULT ] Once inside , you 're gonna break into two groups . The first team is gonna head to the power control systems , here . The second team will head to the lab , here . Now , your maintenance crew I.D.s , they 're not gonna get you in anywhere restricted , so you 're gonna need one of these . It 's a duplicate key card belonging to one of their top scientists . This is good for another 16 hours , so yeah , we 're on the clock . What happens after we get inside the lab ? That 's where things get a bit tricky . The device we 're after , it 's housed in a serillium alloy chamber that is virtually impenetrable . And the door will have a code lock on it that you won 't be able to break . So how do we get in ? [ THREE ] Ah , that 's easy . Just knock a few heads together , threaten to shoot a few people they give us the code . No weapons . That 's funny , 'cause for a second there I thought you said " no weapons . " Without going into detail , the research equipment on this station is highly sensitive . You accidentally destroy the wrong control panel , and the whole place could blow . [ SIX ] So if we can 't use force , then what ? [ WEXLER ] That 's where I come in . There 's not a safe or vault in this galaxy I cannot crack . Basically , I can get into anything . [ TRUFFAULT ] The next shuttle leaves Calliden Prime in 12 hours . [ TRUFFAULT ] It 'll take you ten to get there . Good luck . I still don 't like it . Me neither . But Ferrous just tried to take us out with a nuclear missile . The G.A. ' s after us . We 've got enemies we don 't even remember sending us killer robots . Right now , Mikkei 's our only friend . If we don 't do this , they 'll write us off , too . Look , if you 've got a better idea to get us out of this predicament , I 'd love to hear it . No . I don 't . Then what are we talking about ? Hey . I hear we 've got some new guests onboard . That 's right . Which is why we think it might be best if you stayed out of sight for a while . Are you serious ? [ ONE ] Just until the job 's done . It 's a little hard to explain what you 're doing on board this ship , that 's all . Right , because they 're expecting a team of hardened criminals , not some ... little girl who 's just along for the ride . You are not some little girl just along for the ride . Tell that to Six . Remember to breathe . [ THREE ] So , are you two , like , brother and sister , or what ? Actually , we prefer not to let our relationship be defined by arbitrary categories and outmoded social distinctions . Okay . [ TWO ] All right , Wexler , let 's hear more about your plan to get past this impenetrable door . It 's actually quite simple . At a prearranged time , the second team will trigger a general alarm . Station goes into lockdown , the door loses power . If the door has no power , it can not be opened . And how does that help us ? [ WEXLER ] We bring in our own power . Juice the door independent of the main system . It 'll bust right open . [ THREE ] If it 's so easy , why the hell do we need you slugs , hm ? [ WEXLER ] It 's not like plugging a battery into a kid 's toy . Powering the door without triggering the security protocols is a tricky business . But that 's not the only problem . What ? [ VONS ] As soon as we trigger the lockdown , the station will automatically begin to emit a subspace distress beacon . And every Traugott ship in the sector will turn and head straight for us at maximum FTL . Okay . [ TASH ] We estimate we 'll have less than an hour to detach the device , carry it to the airlock , and shuttle back to the Raza . It 's plenty of time . Okay , good . Let 's go over that one more time . [ WEXLER ] I think the plan is fine . What we need to do is have a drink . Amen . You guys got anything ? Yeah , it 's in the case over there . [ THREE grunts ] [ whispers ] Don 't worry about it , it 's not where I keep the good stuff . No drinking . Ohhhh ! No drinking ! Hey , what 's your problem ? We need to toast this momentous occasion in our relationship , do we not ? [ TWO ] No . We do not . You know , it 's funny , my team has been setting this up for months working on every last detail . The only reason we even need you is because you happen to have a really fast ship . And yet , you deem it okay to just start barking orders at me . I gotta tell you , it 's not very attractive . You think I give a shit whether or not you find me attractive ? Well , I wouldn 't think you 'd wanna admit it in front of your boys here , but there it is . [ ONE ] Okay , okay . Okay , let 's just all take a breath . We 're all friends . Ahh ... [ ONE ] Let me rephrase that : We 're all forced to work together . So let 's make the best of it . I 'll be on the bridge . Hmm . [ WEXLER ] Hey ! Hey , hang on . Yeah , okay , what is it ? I just want to say I 'm sorry . 'Kay ? Clearly got off on the wrong foot in there . But I think we got a lot more in common than you realize . Really ? Yeah , well , you 're clearly the brains of your operation , and that 's gotta put you under a lot of pressure . I understand . I can help you . How , exactly ? I met women like you all over the galaxy . Smart , beautiful . You intimidate men in order to maintain control . But what you really need , deep down is a man to step up and take control of you . Get your hand off me , now . [ TWO gasps ] Don 't tell me you don 't like this . No , you 're right . I 'm gonna enjoy this quite a bit . [ WEXLER grunts ] Ahh ! [ groans ] - - [ bones crack ] - - [ WEXLER screams ] [ WEXLER groans ] [ WEXLER ] Ah ... Ahh ... She 's into me . I can tell . [ sighs ] What the hell is that ? It 's for the pain . All right , then you better give me two of ' em . Oh ! Ahh ... And again . Broken wrist , two fractured ribs , and a badly bruised left testicle . He had it coming . Maybe so , but he 's the only one who knows how to use the battery to tap into the door system and get it opened . We 're done before we even started . This mission is over . [ FIVE ] Well , isn 't this interesting . You were the one who didn 't want me around them , and yet , you were the one who got into a fight . And now , all of sudden , you need me on the team . I admit there 's irony on many levels . Are you gonna do it or not ? Of course . I 'm just messing with you . Okay , here it comes ... And where do you think you 're going ? She 's coming with us . [ SIX ] Like hell she is . [ TWO ] I know it 's not ideal , but we have no choice . And who 's fault is that ? [ TWO ] Hey ! I didn 't even want to take this job , remember ? You and your little boys ' club talked me into it . She 's just a kid ! Excuse me ? [ SIX ] She can 't handle this . [ TWO ] If she 's going to ride with us , we can 't protect her forever and you know it . Hello ? I 'm standing right here . It 's my choice . End of discussion . You better hope nothing happens to her . Look , I told you guys , I 'm good to go , okay ? [ grunts , groans ] Yeah , I can see that . Are you sure she can handle this ? I 'm sure . How old are you , kid ? I have no idea . Well , I was an orphan , and they lost the records . Ahh ... shi ... I went over your specs , and I have to say I was impressed by the way you were going to use the door 's own overload protection to get in without tripping the main line . That was genius . Genius ... it wasn 't genius . Eh , maybe a little . Hey , this kid seems pretty smart to me . [ VONS ] Yeah , there is one problem though . We don 't have an l.D. for her . So how do we get her in ? [ GUARD ] Go ahead . Back again , huh ? Yeah , you know how much I love this place . Whoa . What 's in the big box ? Plumbing supplies . Finally gonna fix that toilet on level 6 . 'Bout time . I hate sharing with G section . Those guys are pigs - Tell me about it . Hey . Yeah , thanks . All right , if anyone sees us on the other side of that door , we are screwed . Nice . What are you doing in here ? Are you the one who reported the gas leak ? Gas leak ? What are you talking about ? I don 't know , but it sounded pretty serious . Enough . Enough ! The coast is clear . You okay ? Yeah . Wasn 't the most comfortable ride . And yet you have no problem with tight spaces when you 're crawling through the vents . Let 's go . Okay , it 's almost time . You guys have any idea what we 're really stealing ? Okay , that 's very reassuring . That 's it . The chamber that houses the device is inside that lab . You better be ready . I 'm ready . I 'm ready ! All right , let 's go . All right ... There it is , just like Wexler said . Let 's do this . Okay . Let 's go . Except he forgot to mention one thing . What ? [ ONE ] What the hell ? [ THREE ] Another robot . It 's an Android . Whatever . He asleep , or what ? [ FIVE ] He 's recharging . [ THREE ] Don 't ! Please , don 't . He 's in power save mode . As long as he stays that way , his main systems are down . So we 're good then . When they trigger the alarm , the power gets cut , remember ? His recharge cycle will be interrupted . What do you think happens then ? Punch it . [ alarms sound ] [ gasps ] [ alarms sound ] Hey . How 's it going ? There 's been a security breach . None of you are authorized to be here . [ ONE ] Yeah , it 's a ... a funny story about that . [ ANDROID GUARD ] All of you line up facing the wall , with your hands behind your heads . Take it easy there , pal . [ yells. grunts ] I hate robots ! Android ! Whatever ! [ THREE grunts ] [ screams ] Look , there 's a perfectly good explanation fo- - [ yells ] Catch me ! [ ONE screams , grunts ] [ alarms sound ] Can you kill that noise ? 'Course , but that won 't affect the beacon . There 's no way to turn that off as long as we maintain the lockdown . I wonder how the others are doing ? [ THREE screams ] [ THREE yells ] [ grunting ] [ ONE ] Cain ! [ CAIN growls ] [ THREE yells ] [ ONE rasps ] Still think she 's not up to it ? Nice work , kid . Yeah , don 't thank me yet . We 've got a new problem . No . I had to dump the whole charge to drop him like that . The battery 's completely drained . We 've got no way to open it now . We 're screwed , that 's it . No choice--we got to abort . We 've got to pull the plug , that 's it . [ THREE ] No-no-no ! We did not come all this way just to give up now . We can 't open the door ! The kid 'll think of something ! Right ? Your responsibility 's the door . We 're just the muscle , right ? Yeah , right . And you really came through on that score , didn 't you ? Is there any possible way ? Because if not , Cain 's right . We gotta pull the plug . No , just-just gimme a minute . I shorted his control systems , but the main power 's still intact . The only question is , does he have enough juice ? We interrupted his recharge cycle ... [ ONE ] Wait , are you saying we use the Android 's power to charge the door ? [ FIVE ] Yes . Can you do that ? Maybe . [ THREE ] See ? Told ya . [ THREE chuckles ] We 're in sensor range of the station . Lockdown appears to be in effect . Emergency power only . Any there any other ships nearby ? Not yet . They 'll be here soon enough . We 'll go prep the shuttle . [ ONE ] Look , I don 't mean to add any stress on you , but this whole thing was timed down to the last second . We 've got about five minutes until the others end the lockdown and that security system comes back online . [ FIVE ] I 'm going as fast as I can . But if I don 't adjust the inverter to minimize harmonic distortion , we 'll get pulsating torque and the whole thing will fry . Do you understand a single word she says ? I stopped listening a long time ago . Okay , okay , I think I 've got it . [ ONE ] Are you sure ? 'Cause that pulsating thing sounded kinda bad . I 'm as sure as I 'll ever be . All right . Do it . Nice work . That 's it . Time 's up . How do we know if they 've secured the device ? [ TASH ] If they haven 't by now , it 's too late anyway . [ VONS ] As soon as lockdown ends , protocol says all station personnel stay put , except security . Now they 'll initiate a room to room sweep , so chances are we 're gonna run into them on the way out . Be ready . That 's it . Time to go . Reverse thrusters , ten percent . We 're docked . Wait here . B Squad , what 's your status ? [ B SQUAD LEADER ] G Section is clear . We 're heading down to level twelve . Understood . How many ? There 's eight of them including the leader . They 're all carrying some kind of club . Shock sticks . We use ' em to break up bar fights . It 's not pretty . There 's no other way to the airlock . We 're cut off . We 're gonna have to rush them . Yeah , they have weapons ; we don 't . We also don 't have a choice if we want to get out of here . [ GUARD ] D Squad , are you reading me ? [ D SQUAD LEADER ] Yes sir , go ahead . [ GUARD ] We 've got the main airlock , I want you on auxiliary . No one gets off this station until I give the all clear . [ FOUR ] Are you sure about that ? [ GUARD yells ] We got it ! We got the device ! You missed all the fun . Believe me , we had enough fun on our own . Let 's get the hell out of here . [ THREE ] Get it strapped down . Fire it up , Tiny . Time to go . Raza , this is the Marauder , we 're on our way . [ THREE sighs ] Did you get it ? We got it . Android , get us out of here . Do me a favor , secure this thing . [ WEXLER ] Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey . It stays with me . We 've got a safe place . Our ship , our rules . Go . [ THREE ] Now we can drink ! [ SIX ] You did all right down there . You did . [ THREE ] Cheers . All right , there you go , top it up . All right , all right . [ THREE ] And all right for the kid . Whoa , no ! - -No ... - - [ FIVE ] Hey ! [ THREE ] What are you , her daddy ? Yeah , what are you thinking ? Really ? [ THREE ] Are you kidding me ? She did great out there ! She kicked the robot 's ass . Nice work , kid . Hope you don 't mind . Wanted to have at least one look at the bridge of the famous Raza before we go our separate ways . It 's really impressive the way you 've maintained this ship . Look at this place , can 't be easy . Why , thank you . I do take a great deal of pride in- - - - [ SIX ] Cheers . - - [ THREE ] Cheers ! - - [ laughter ] - -Bottoms up . [ laughing continues ] [ THREE ] Hey , look who it is ! Catch . Drinks right there , drinks go to you . You know , when you guys first came on board , didn 't like you much . [ CAIN ] Aww , and now ? Still don 't like you . [ laughter ] Then you 're about to like us even less . [ SIX ] The hell ... ? That 's my gun . Not anymore . Okay , kid . Make yourself useful . [ TWO ] Android , why did we drop out of FTL ? Hey ! [ TWO grunts ] [ TWO gasps ] Wexler , what is this ? Smile for the camera . Your friends are all watching . [ WEXLER ] Now I know you got the device in a vault somewhere on board , so why don 't you give me the code , and this 'll all be over . I thought you could crack any safe in the galaxy . [ WEXLER ] I can . I just don 't have a lot of time right now , so we 're gonna do this the easy way . If you think I 'm gonna give you anything , you can forget it . [ WEXLER ] Oh no , no , no , no , no . Not you , your friends . See , they can either give me the code , or they can watch you get blown out into space . [ WEXLER ] So what 's it gonna be , folks ? Don 't give him anything . [ WEXLER ] Hey , hey , hey ! Do you think I 'm bluffing ? I mean hell , you 're just the first . After that , we do the kid . [ WEXLER ] Nothing ? Okay , I tell you what I 'm gonna do , we 're gonna kick it old school . I 'm gonna count down from five , and if nobody speaks by the time I get to zero , out she goes . [ gasps ] [ WEXLER ] Five , four , three , two- -M-- - -Maplethorpe ! [ THREE ] The code is Maplethorpe . With an " e . " Check it out . We did the job . Why are you doing this ? Are you kidding me ? The collective bounty on this crew is worth as much as the device alone . Plus , this way , we get to keep the ship . It 's what I like to call a win-win-win . Yeah , it 's Cain . I 'm in . We got it . You know , it 's really too bad , we could 've had some real fun together . [ gasps ] No- - !

 Jimmy : What would you do with a second chance ? Before you answer , let me give you some advice . Second chances can be a real monster . [ Creedence Clearwater revival 's " bad moon rising " plays ] I 'm gonna call the police . No need for that . * I see a bad moon rising * that same music over and over . I 'm gonna get the cops up here . FBI . Will that do ? * I see trouble on the way * * I see earthquakes and lightning ' * neighbors are complaining about the noise again , dad . * I see * why don 't you go ahead and let me have that smoke , too ? Come on . I was having a lot more fun before you showed up . It 's 3 : 00 in the afternoon . Are you planning on getting dressed today ? I will take it under advisement . What 's all this ? Is this my case ? You 're working my case now ? [ Chuckles ] Someone has to . Six bank jobs in 12 months , dead security guard , nobody locked up for it . [ Chuckles ] In my day , we would 've done ... What needed to get done . Yeah , I 'm pretty much aware of that . [ Toilet flushes ] [ Keys jingle ] Dad , is somebody else here ? Oh . Hey . I was just on my way out . Duval , this is Bettina . Bettina is a member of my , uh , music appreciation club . We meet once a week . Don 't worry . He 's too old to really do much of anything . And how much does not really doing much of anything cost him ? Don 't answer that ! It 's impolite to talk about money . My son should know that . Don 't be rude , Duval . I 'll see you . You know where to find me . Oh ! Hello . Hello . Oh , geez . Are you here for the music appreciation club ? The music ... I 'm sorry . The what club ? Gracie , I thought I told you to wait in the car . Well , I wanted to come say hi to grandpa . I 'll see you next week . Who was that ? No one . Gracie , as long as you 're here , go ahead and empty the rest of that bourbon in the kitchen sink . Grandpa , what does the doctor say about mixing your meds and bourbon ? Oh , that I had to give one of them up . Can 't remember which one . Oh , you know , I used to have a lot more records . You know what happened to them ? Yeah , they 're with the boxes from when we shut down your house ... After mom died . Ah . They 're up in our attic . I can go up there when we get back . Remember ? Dad 's taking me on a college Gracie tour . You can take the time ? It 's two days with my daughter . I 've been on this case for a year . You know best . Kiddo . Gracie , come on , let 's go . Okay . I , uh , I poured a little of the bourbon into a glass by the sink . Oh , you are an understanding child . Gracie ? You 'll always be the sheriff . [ Chuckles ] Don 't let your father hear you say that . He doesn 't like it . [ Both chuckle ] I 'll see you later . [ Door closes ] * Every day , you wake up in the morning * * trying to ignore the way you feel * * reading all the bad news in the papers * * of all the people that are sleeping at the wheel * * can 't believe a thing your daddy told ya * * couldn 't ever even walk a line * * mama always had her best intentions * * telling you everything will be fine * I don 't know what face that is . It 's my reassuring face , Otto . Oh . I thought maybe it was anxious . Maybe it 's a bit of both . The board needs me to do interviews to ease the shareholders ' minds . They 'll ask what you 've been doing , Otto . [ Speaking twin-speak ] Not in twin-speak , Otto . In English . You won 't tell them , will you ? No . I won 't tell them . It works with the fish . I want to go to human trials . After mice , rats , and chimps . You know that , Otto . But we can 't wait . You 're too sick , Mary . They were dead . We brought them back . * So , don 't close your eyes * * or time will pass you by * * oh , oh * * don 't hear , don 't see , don 't speak no evil * * don 't hear , don 't see , don 't speak no evil * * don 't hear , don 't see , don 't speak no evil * [ crickets chirping ] [ Creaking ] * * [ paper rips ] Jimmy : What the hell are you doing in my son 's office ? ! Just take it easy . I asked you a question . Answer me ! Look me in the eye ! Or we will both find out if I remember how to throw this knife . No , don 't do it ! Unh ! [ Groans ] Man : Get what we need . Clean this place up like it never happened . Go to hell ! I got a better idea , sheriff . You were depressed , drinking too much . [ Grunts ] After what you put your family through . [ Coughs ] I 'm surprised it took you so long to do it . All right , get him over ! What ? Do it ! He 's seen our faces ! Come on , man , do it now ! My son will catch you ! No , Mr. Pritchard , he won 't . [ Gasps ] [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Guns cock ] [ Police radio chatter ] Reporter : In what is being ruled a suicide , ex-king county sheriff Jimmy Pritchard took his own life nearly 15 years after stepping down from his office in the wake of a widespread corruption scandal . Pritchard is survived by two children and one grandchild . [ Beep ] 4-year-old Otto Goodwin , unable to connect with the world around him , constructed a private language consisting of over 3,000 words . His twin sister , Mary , was the only person he taught it to . He would speak to her . She would speak to the world . Within a few years , he would give Mary the algorithm for looking glass , and she would turn it into a $ 10-billion social-media giant . Morgan : Mary , when you and your twin brother started looking glass nearly 10 years ago now , did you ever imagine you 'd end up with a billion users ? Otto wrote that code to help people connect . That number one billion shows how hungry people are to connect with each other . But human connection is something that Otto has always struggled with , and he spoke only to you till he was 9 years old and then only the language of his own invention . And people are saying two things . I want to put these to you very strongly tonight . The obvious question for you ... Otto : Come on , Mary . Is Otto burnt out ? Say yes . Can looking glass survive without him ? Say yes . Otto 's become very distant , almost disappeared off the face of the earth , and his absence has created a vacuum where competitors can pounce into the market . I 'm sorry , Otto . Mary says no . Why ? Doesn 't she know that by the time we find another donor , it 'll be too late ? Why would she say no ? ! You know why , Otto . Your sister still hasn 't given the go ahead for human testing . But it 's the only thing that 'll save her ! A lot of waiting . Arthur , how long will Mary be in New York ? She has one more day of interviews . Okay . He 's essentially just disappeared . Okay . Most concerning ... Switch the serial numbers . Procure the body . She is going to be angry . You know that . * * [ beeping ] [ Beep ] [ Ping ] [ Monitor beeping ] What did you do , Otto ? Please don 't be mad . Arthur , terminate the process ! Turn it off ! Turn it all off now ! Arthur : Yes , Mary . Give me a moment . Please , Mary , don 't . We had no right to do this ... To take a body without asking ! Shutting down in 25 seconds . Please , Mary , don 't ! We need to send him back . He shouldn 't be here ! Please , let me just tell you who he is first . [ Beeping continues ] It 's who we 've been waiting for . [ Beeping continues ] You don 't have to die , Mary . His genetic variation is 1 in 10 million . 15 seconds . It works with him , Mary . He 's here to save us . Please don 't leave me alone . My father , Jimmy Pritchard , was in the department for 30 years , and ... They didn 't even send a couple of lousy motorcycles . Without departmental honors . He didn 't expect anything of anyone . Didn 't expect anything of me . All right , that 's ... That 's enough now , Helen . Mm ! You 've had too much to drink . Oh ! [ Laughs ] Well , it 's the only thing he taught me . Meet me in my office . [ Cabinet closes ] You remember the guard they killed on the first job ? You 've got to be kidding me , partner . We 're not working today . I got to thinking , maybe he was in on it , and they were cleaning up when they killed him . So I pulled his phone records . Okay . Pulled his phone records , and ... Nothing connects him to it . Why can 't we get these guys ? Duval , that 's for tomorrow . Today 's about your family , your dad . My dad would 've wanted me to work today , believe me . His cells , recoded for optimum growth and capacity , will allow us to begin Mary 's treatment on schedule . Arthur : Otto , may I ask a question ? What is it , Arthur ? If the specimen in the tank regains consciousness , what should I refer to him as ? Jimmy Pritchard is dead . Refer to him as ... Proprietary Goodwin technology . Should I run that name by Mary ? [ Telephone ringing ] [ Glasses beeping ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Mary ? Your oncologist is on the line . Thank you , doctor . As always , I appreciate your discretion . [ Breathes deeply ] What 's our current price per share ? $ 476.98 . Still holding even ... good . The interviews you 're doing have stabilized the stock . Let 's line up some more . Set a meeting with PR . Right away . Ted talks have always wanted you , as well . They 've always wanted Otto , but they 'll take me , so make that happen , and , uh ... [ Sighs ] Okay , Alexa . What 's with the mother hen look ? I 'm sorry . Can I ask what the doctor said ? My numbers are getting worse . Chemo still isn 't working . Then is it time to let the board and the public know your ill and that your illness is what 's distracting Otto and ... Get ahead of the story ? Of course , you 've already considered everything . Otto 's not ready for anyone to know I 'm sick . I 'm just your assistant . And this is probably not my place , but if the chemo isn 't working , won 't Otto have to start getting ready ? There are no other treatments , are there ? Phase one complete . Should I attempt to restore consciousness ? [ Monitor beeping ] Mom and dad believed in god , Otto . They would 've said what we 're about to do should be left to god . [ Beeping continues ] They would 've said we 'd be punished for what we 're about to do . They would 've wanted us to take care of each other . [ Beeping continues ] From now on , no more decisions on your own . Do you understand ? [ Beeping continues ] I promise . Initiate phase two , Arthur . [ Beeping , electricity crackling ] [ Guns cock ] [ Camera shutters click ] [ Beeping , crackling continues ] [ Gasps ] Mary , please restate . I am not programmed to recognize twin-speak . * * Phase two complete . [ Coughing ] [ Sighs ] [ Breathes deeply ] Your cigarettes have been removed . [ Sighs , grunts ] [ Sighs ] And who would you be ? My name 's Mary ... Mary Goodwin . I don 't want you to be afraid . Do I look afraid ? [ Grunts , coughs ] So [ Coughs ] Did we , uh ... Do I owe you for something ? No . You don 't owe me anything . What are you doing in my apartment , Mary ? You know this is your apartment ? Good . That 's really good . Yeah , I know this is my apartment . I want to know what you 're doing in it . And why you took my smokes . Because they cause cancer . And what about your name ? Can you tell me your name ? Well , let 's see . I 've had it for 75 years . It 's Jimmy Pritchard . What are you ... some kind of ... Visiting nurse ? Social worker ? Is that it ? Did my kids send you to check on me ? Well , you can put in your report to my special agent son that I know who I am . I don 't need anybody to take care of me . And I feel fine . I even got my appetite back . I thought you might be hungry . I made a sandwich for you . [ Muffled ] Mmm , god , that 's good . Usually , my teeth would bother me with something like this . [ Inhales deeply ] [ Plate clinks ] Mr. Pritchard , can you tell me the last thing you remember ? Why is my hand like this ? Who are you ? His respiration rate is rising . Mary Goodwin . I 'm here to help you . [ Birds chirping ] Then why is my ... Hand not my hand , Mary ? My voice sounds funny . Was there an accident ? No . Not an accident . You 've been through something , but it 's going to be okay , I promise . What do you remember ? [ Sighing ] My son 's house and ... [ Sighs ] A bridge . There used to be a mirror right here . Why did you take it down ? Because we need to do this slowly . Do ... What ... Slowly ? I know you . Blood pressure 170 over 120 . I know you . You 're one of those ... Rich computer twits . The hell are you doing in my apartment ? I think we need to stop now , okay ? No ! [ Beep ] We need to stop now , okay ? Mary ... You 're gonna feel tired . Get out of there ! I need you to sleep . When you wake up , we can start again . Okay , but right now ... Aah ! I fell ! [ Crying ] I hit the ground ! I ... [ Crying continues ] I hit the ground . [ Gasping ] I died . Oh ! [ Breathing heavily ] [ Sighs ] Why didn 't the sedative release ? ! It did release . His body needed 12 times the prescribed amount . He 's stronger than predicted . [ Birds chirping ] We need to know how much . Keep him sedated until we run more tests . I can 't . The capsule under his skin is now empty . [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] [ Metal clatters ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] Jimmy : Open it ! [ Pounding on door ] Let me out ! [ Grunts ] [ Clattering ] [ Alarm blaring ] He 's broken through the back wall of the room . He 's in the house . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Sighs ] [ Beep ] Mary : We 're offering you another chance . What ? Why did you do this to me ? You have a very rare genetic precursor which allowed us to recode and regenerate your cells . I don 't know what any of that means , but this ... This is me . But this isn 't me ! This is the best version of you . You 're the first to journey all the way back . To get another chance . [ Sighs ] Don 't you want it ? [ Monitor beeping ] With another chance , maybe you don 't have to end it that way . [ Sighs ] Is ... Is that what people think ? They think I jumped ... Off that bridge ? Your memory 's been through a shock . You might not be ready to remember what you did . No ! There was a break-in in my son 's house . I caught them , and then they threw me off that bridge . No , wait . It was not a ... not a ... Not a break-in . They were ... They were looking for something , but ... I was just an old man , so they just ... Tossed me like a bag of dirt . I was just an old man , wasn 't I ? I don 't care if you believe me . My son is in trouble . [ Grunts ] [ Gasps ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Heart beating loudly ] [ Bird cries ] [ Insects buzzing ] [ Wings whirring ] [ Leash rattling ] [ Dog growling , barks ] * * [ dog barking ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Dog growling ] [ Dog panting ] Nice day for a hike . Yeah , it is . Trainer , right ? Gym or private ? Private ? What do you do ... trx , p90x , kettlebells , sit ? Because ... You feel this ? [ Sighs ] No matter what I do , there 's like 2 % that I can 't get rid of . Feel that . [ Birds chirping ] Yep , I feel it . Are you taking new clients ? [ Sighs ] Um ... No , not right now . Okay . See you then . [ Chuckles ] * * Mary : He was in the sheriff 's department for 30 years . He 'll try to find out who broke into his son 's house . He 'll try to solve the crime . Mary , I don 't mean to disagree with you about Mr. Pritchard 's current intentions , but my list of his priorities ranks law enforcement below women , alcohol , and music . [ Up-tempo music playing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Hi ! Hi . [ Chuckles ] What ? It 's loud in here ! Do I know you ? No , but ... I know a friend of yours . Jimmy Pritchard . He said you hang out here . Sheriff Pritchard killed himself . Yeah . Yeah , I read about that , but he said that if I ever need anything , that I should see you . And what do you want ? I want to go to your place . You say you 're a friend of Jimmy 's ? Uh-huh . I didn 't see you at his funeral . You were at m ... You were at the funeral ? Yeah . How was it ? Uh ... Real sad ... I guess ? No . There was hardly any weeping . Big turnout ? Would you like to buy me a drink ? [ Chuckles ] The thing is , I 'm kind of tapped out right now . And so concludes our time together . But ... but I 'm a friend of Jimmy 's . Then you should understand the nature of our relationship . [ Up-tempo music continues ] Don 't move . Room 's single use , bro . You look fit . You do kettlebells ? Do I do kettle ... Answer . [ Grunts ] Found your secret . You a cop ? I 'm just gonna need your bankroll now , buddy . [ Groans ] Huh , I 'll have to get a handle on that . [ Up-tempo music continues ] [ Chuckles ] This will do . What kind of cop are you ? ! Sonny , I 'm the sheriff . * Don 't do it , don 't do it * * don 't touch the bass * * don 't do it , don 't do it * * don 't touch my * you just want to use my computer ? It has the Internet , right ? Yes . It has ... The Internet . That 's all you want to do ? My computer ? Mm-hmm . [ Keyboard clacking ] Well , I 'm gonna go take a shower . You can get your cyber-freak on . [ Beeping ] Mary : What are you doing , Mr. Pritchard ? Here , Mr. Pritchard , on the screen . Your friend Bettina 's on looking glass . We 've been listening for your voice pattern . On her computer ? On two billion computers and devices . Is it your plan to have sex with that woman ? Is it my plan to have what ? If you do , you 're most likely super-potent . Do you have protection ? Super ... lady , I 'm just trying to find out about the break-in at my son 's house . There 's no record of a break-in . I 've searched every database for one . Well , then he doesn 't know they were there . I mean , how could he not notice that somebody 's gone through his things ? I mean , where 's his head at ? I have to sit him down about that . Mr. Pritchard , you can 't sit him down about anything . Your family buried you . Look . Make it bigger . [ Beeping ] [ Inhales sharply ] Son of a bitch . My killer was carrying my own damn casket . " John Strayburn . " I know that name . That 's my son 's partner . You done ? We need you to get back here right ... Baby , it is messed up if you would rather do it online like that ... Than when you have someone here in the flesh . * Ba-boom , Ba-boom , Ba-boom * * boom , boom , boom * * Ba-boom , Ba-boom , Ba-boom * this does nothing for you ? * boom , boom , boom * * Ba-boom , Ba-boom , Ba-boom * * boom , boom , boom * you know ... * Ba-boom , Ba-boom , Ba-boom * Pritchard told me that he , uh , was too old to really do much of anything .

That 's it ! There you go ! A lot of hustle there ! You girls will be in in a minute , all right ? Damn it , he 's the coach . Good ! Bring it around ! That 's it ! There you go ! Give her a target on the wing ! I ask that parents stay over there . Jackie , watch that left foot ! Woman : Oh , yeah ! Uh ... I 'm not a parent . I knew your father . And , uh , there 's something we need to talk about . Nice job , Sarah ! Cut down that angle ! Man : Block , Gina ! Let me guess . He owed you money ? No . Nothing like that . I 'm coaching my girl 's soccer game , all right ? Wait over there , and I 'll give you five minutes when it 's over . This is important . So is this . We 'll talk later . Gracie : Dad ? Yeah ? Can Robin and I switch ? She wants to play right-mid ? Uh ... Say it 's okay . [ Indistinct shouting ] Sorry . Mister , do I know you ? No . You don 't know me . There you go ! Watch that left foot ! Good ! Tell Robin right-mid , okay ? Why are you still standing here ? I 'll wait over there . [ Sighs ] That 's it , that 's it ! That was good ! Lots of hustle ! Woman : You 're gonna have to cut that off ! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Shouting echoes , warbling ] Man : Team looks good , girls ! Make sure you 're ready . Saw you talking to super dad . [ Chuckles ] He 's my big brother . Helen ? Yeah . [ Shouting echoes ] [ Echoing ] Are you okay ? No . Something 's wrong . It 's ... The process is like a transplant . Your body 's going into rejection . My son is in trouble . You can 't help him like this . Come with me now before it 's too late . * * I know you can see me , so look . I 'm going to help you help your son . Deposits into Strayburn 's account after each robbery . Texts to Strayburn before each robbery . Show this to Duval . [ Inhales deeply ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Birds chirping ] Why 'd you really do this to me , Mary ? [ Sighs ] I have cancer . There 's no cure . Chemo stopped working six months ago . [ Monitor beeps ] Otto recoded your red blood cells to fight off death . Now he 's using them to fight the cancer in my blood . This is you going in me . [ Sighs ] You brought me back ... To save you ? And ... That in there , that 's ... That 's me ? [ Birds chirping ] [ Sighs ] Look , I 'm 75 years old . I 've seen a lot of my friends go to cancer , and it ain 't pretty . I feel for you . But other people don 't do this . Otto is not other people . Otto ? You 're the one dying . Otto can 't be without me . Maybe Otto could find himself a woman who isn 't his sister ? My room , 1988 ! Arthur : You know you 're not supposed to manage your feelings this way . Mary prefers you stay present . I spoke for him until he was 9 . He experiences the world through me . If I go , he 'll retreat into himself . He 'll be lost . So go save your son . But then come back to us . You 'll be needing a car . * * It was our father 's . Suits you . You have 12 hours before you need to be back in the tank . Set the timer on the phone for you . Maybe you dig this cops-and-robbers stuff . * But they said it at the big and tall * * a faded king , like a prince * * and a joker 's pair of coveralls * * when the motor chase starts * oh , yeah . This will do . * There 's no getting out of this one * you 've got 10 seconds to explain why you 're outside my house . Read this . Then we 'll talk . [ Birds chirping ] It 's a nice house . Looks like a real nice place to raise a family . Until I figure out what you want , it 's best you don 't mention my family . This is crap . I don 't believe it . You go check it out then . And you came by this how ? [ Sighs ] Your father didn 't trust Strayburn . My father ? I didn 't think he knew my partner . [ Chirping continues ] I looked through these records . I didn 't see any of this . Just use the file , Duval . Close the case . It 'll make your career . And how exactly did you know my father ? I did some work for him . Used to talk about you . Said how proud he was of you raising that little girl , Gracie , on your own . He wasn 't always amazed at how well you turned out seeing what a terrible father he was . You 're not gonna dispute that , huh ? Why don 't you come in with me ? Just put this under anonymous tip . Just keep my name that way , too . It 's funny . My partner was more family to me than my dad ever was . [ Sighs ] You know , he did what he had to do to keep this county and his family safe . " What he had to do " ? Yeah . [ Scoffs ] You mean like planting evidence instead of coming home at night ? No . He did what he wanted to do . He was selfish to the end . Like walking off that bridge . You sound relieved he 's gone . Okay , kid . I 'll stay gone . [ Sighs ] [ Car door closes ] Arthur : Mr. Pritchard has left his son . He seems to be entering a bar .

He 's dirty . [ Monitor beeping ] [ Cheers and applause ] What if it 's not just my son 's partner ? What if it goes deeper ? [ Cellphone ringing ] Helen : Hey . Hey . Remember that guy at the soccer game the other day ? Sure , I remember him . Why ? What about him ? I saw him today . You and me made a deal with these guys , so this needs to go away ... Right now . [ Suspenseful music plays ] It 's like I knew him , but I 'd never met him . He was close with dad . You know , dad wasn 't always exactly faithful to mom . What are you saying ... we have a brother we didn 't know about ? Hello ? [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Beep ] You 've reached the voice-mail for Duval Pritchard . Please leave a message . Thought I was done with him , but [ Sighs ] You 're never done with your kids . Please , just ... Help me find him . You have less than an hour . Look at your timer . You need to come back now . Full rejection leaves us with nothing to work with . Death this time is for good . [ Sighs ] Are you showing any signs of rejection ? No . Where 'd you get the file , Duval ? How could you get into business with these guys ? You 're my partner . And you know how it is . You take a little , and then you take a little more , and then you can 't get out . You should 've come to me ! Where did you get that file ? ! Go to hell . Funny . That 's what your dad said . All right , we 're here . Bring him out . Your son 's phone should be 50 yards straight ahead . Do you see him ? [ Monitor beeping ] [ Engine revving ] [ Tires screech ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] He 's not here . [ Engine turns over ] [ Engine revving ] I was never there for him before . Maybe I 'm not just back to save you . The men who took Duval have their phones turned off . Your son could be anywhere . No . Not anywhere . [ Engine revving ] Duval : [ Grunts ] John : Easy there . [ Grunting ] Raaaaaah ! Whoa ! [ Grunts ] [ Both grunting ] I told you my son would get you ! [ Gun cocks ] [ Screaming ] Duval : Don 't you do it ! Don 't ! Aah ! Don 't ! [ Whimpering ] He killed your father ! He was gonna kill you ! He was in your house ! [ Breathing heavily ] Then he 's my case , if I want to bring the rest of them down ! [ Grunts ] Put your hands behind your head ! And get down on your knees . I 'm not gonna do that . Who the hell are you ? ! [ Breathes heavily ] What is your connection to my father ? ! Like I said ... I did some work for him . What if we took a blood test , you and me ? What would that show ? Not right now , no . I have to go . [ Engine revving , tires squealing ] [ Sighs ] [ Warbling ] [ Sighs ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Crickets chirping ] * * [ keys jingling ] Mr. Pritchard ? !

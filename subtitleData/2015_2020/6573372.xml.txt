 I shouldn 't have done this to you . I 'm sorry . You rather upset people when you gave the bracelet to the detective . Charles Collins . He killed Babs and framed Rich . He 's my brother . I 've no choice but to do everything I can to ... No , you do have a choice . You 're just too far gone to make it ! I 'm a murder detective . If I was gonna kill someone , do you not think I 'd do a better job than store his head in my freezer ? I know you didn 't do it . What shall I say to Daisy ? Nothing . Why don 't you come and see me tomorrow ? Bring Daisy . Rich ! No ! Rich ! Open the door ! Open the door ! Rich ! No ! Golding ! NOOOO ! I knew it was you . I 'm not Golding . You 're lying . I promise you I 'm not . But that doesn 't mean we don 't work together . I 'm not the one who 's done this to you . Then let me go . I can 't do that ... but I won 't hurt you . After all ... we 're family . I 'm not your family . Didn 't she tell you ? Your mother and my father were lovers . - No ! - Some 34 years ago . It 's bullshit ! I found this case of photographs after my father died . Have a look . Believe me , Eve . No-one wants any harm done to you . You 're too valuable ... and unique . You started all this by giving the bracelet to Clayton . Your father ... never wanted you to have it . He said that you were too ... unstable . Now , now , Harry , calm down . Please , please . I am begging you . Cut off my arm . Take the bracelet ! I can 't . It 's joined to you now . That 's obvious to me . That was my father 's fault . He messed up the handover . Vincent ... Lermontov ... was your father ! Hum , my adoptive father . The adoption was kept secret , but the boys at the boarding school he sent me to figured it out , nicknamed me Golding ... after gold foundling . What do you want ? Harry , you have a choice to make . What choice ? Tomorrow morning , I 'm going to have someone kill Richard , and I 'm going to kill Anna ... and Daisy . Unless ... you kill yourself . 2016 , March 25 Come on , Clayton . Good to go , Steve ! Slash your throat , they 'll blame me . No-one 's gonna believe that Harry Clayton killed himself . I 'm the perfect fall guy . You caught me 3 weeks ago so ... Are you really gonna do this ? If I don 't , they 'll bring my brother up from the hospital wing , kill him ... They 'll kill my wife , my daughter . Listen to me . Your brother 's not in a hospital wing anymore . They released him last night . What 's ever happened , he 's gone . Those guards will be back in about 10 minutes to check on you . Jesus ! Harry . Harry ! Harry , listen to me ! You saved my life . I owe you . Come on , help me with it , man . Where does it go ? It 's a tunnel between B and C wings . They use it to move drugs between remand and the lifers in C wing . It 's only going to hid you until farther . You 're gonna need this . Will it get me out of prison ? No but C wing 's got access to the roof . You 've got the bracelet . You 're coming ? No . I was never lucky . Go ! Where is he ? Where 's Clayton ? Where 's Clayton ? Sir ! Move it ! You ! Did Clayton go down there ? Come and man , give me that ! All Clayton will be thinking about is Anna and Daisy . Who are secure . And Harry will do everything he can to find them . Can I be frank , sir ? Sure . There 's a point in every operation when you have to ask if the ends justify the means . And you think we 've reached that point with Clayton ? I understand that you have some very personal reasons for needing Clayton dead and for retrieving this ... bracelet . But if we pursue him now , then we are in serious danger of exposing everything that we have ALL worked so hard to set up . You have one more chance . Mum , look ! The pool ! Nikhail 's on his way . He wanted you to just hang out and relax before he got back . And when will he be here ? He should be here just before lunch . Is there anything you or your daughter don 't eat ? I 'm a gluten-free lactose-intolerant vegan . She 's 11 . Hum , I 've been trying to get a signal since we got here . Sorry . It 's pretty crap round here . Really ? In Hampstead ? What about out there , in the garden ? It 's pretty crap everywhere , believe me . Attention all vans ! We have a prisoner escaped . Repeat . We have a prisoner escaped . Please , check all vans and report back . There he is ! Pull the van around , OK ? Mate ! Mate ! I didn 't see you ! Clayton escaped at 9 : 09 am . Apparently , he climbed to the underside of a prison van . I want the head of the operation to recapture him . You think he 's still east ? That 's where I 'd start . OK , get going . Harry 's too smart to do this . They must have tried to kill him in prison . I want you to be Orwell 's second . How do I play this ? Carefully . We have to assume Golding is still chasing Harry as well . It stopped paying out . You 're wasting money . Really ? I 'd take it . It 's not enough . ... escape from Whitecross prison happened this morning . The public are warned that he is dangerous and not to be approached . Hello ? Ruth , it 's Harry . Please , don 't hang up . I need to talk to Anna . Harry , Anna and Daisy aren 't here . Where are they ? Ruth , it 's important you answer the question . A car came to pick them up very early this morning . Where was it going ? Anna said something about spending the weekend with Nikhail ... Do you have an address for Nikhail ? An address ? Yes . I ... I ... I-I think I 've got something here . Er ... Mahogany apartment , St Pancras Hotel , WC1 . Thanks , Ruth . The police will be on their way to you . Say nothing about this conversation . Suspect sighted leaving St Anne church on Bethnal Green Road . Suspect now running down Buxton Road . D.I. Orwell to D.S. Clark , we 're on Buxton Road , Bethnal Green . What is your current location ? Over . 2 minutes away from you . Definitely in this area . Repeat . He 's definitely here . Suspect continuing west on Buxton Road . You should have eyes on suspect soon . Airborne 1 , out . Can I help you with something , Anna ? Yeah . Why is this door locked ? For security reasons . Is there something you need ? I just wanna go to the High Street and get a few things . Well , why don 't you tell me what it is you need ? And I 'll send someone to fetch it for you . I 'd rather get it myself . Why won 't you open this door ? This is ridiculous ! We don 't let out of this house ? I promise you . Nikhail 'll be back here very soon . He 'll explain everything to you then . What you 're talking about ? There 's been some trouble at the prison . That 's why he 's delayed . Now , why don 't you go back and join your daughter ? You don 't wanna cause her any unnecessary distress , do you ? No . Sorry , we 've already booked that table . Would you have availability on the 22 ? Hold one second . Er ... Your private apartments are ? That floor . Thanks . Yes . Would you have a suite ... We 've got a positive sighting for Clayton at St Pancras Station . From D.S. Chohan , all received . Housekeeping . Housekeeping . Hah ! AAAH ! Aaaaaaaaaah ! This way . Chohan ! There 's been a fatality at the St Pancras Hotel . Sir ! There 's been a major incident at the hotel . Where to ? Come on ! Clark ! Am I right in saying that Anna Clayton 's mother just reported Anna and Daisy missing ? Yes , Sir . We 've got a team over there now . Apparently , she was held at gunpoint and forced to give an address for them - off the front to Harry . - What for ? I don 't know . But the address she gave was Governor Julian 's flat here in St Pancras . Apparently , Anna Clayton and him have seen each other . Yeah , yeah . I know . Right , I want you to e-mail a photograph of Charles Collins to Anna 's mother . See if she can identify him as the gunman . Yes , Sir . We need to figure out who this is and why Harry came here to kill him . There are other ways this could have played out . Sir ? Got a witness here who saw Harry throw the victim off the balcony . Rich . They 're waiting for you outside . I know . So , you escaped . Told them you wouldn 't be stupid enough to come here , but ... guess I was wrong . I 'm so sorry . Really ? It should have been me . Would have made more sense . They killed Barbara , Harry . They murdered her . And then , they got me ... and they jumped up and down on my arm over and over until it got breaking . Doctor say I was lucky that they could reset it . Rich , I badly need your help . We 're done ! No . You 're toxic . Everything close to you gets destroyed . There 's Francis . And yet nothing ever happens to Harry , - does it ? - Rich , don 't do this . No , nothing ever happens to Harry . I don 't want you in my life anymore . No . OK . Now ... I 'm gonna give you 30 seconds and then I 'm gonna call you in . I can 't risk not doing everything by the book now , because of you . - They probably saw you here . - Because of Anna and Daisy . What ? Julian has Daisy . Julian ? Governor Julian is Golding . I have to find them . I love you . Suri . Collins is dead . I think he came after Harry and now , he 's dead . You 're absolutely sure it 's him ? Yes , Sir . Orwell has not ID 'd him yet , but it 's just a matter of time . Are you still at the crime scene ? Yes , Sir . Right , you need to leave there , now . What do I say to Orwell ? - Nothing . Just leave . - Sir ? Anna and Daisy Clayton have been abducted . Her signal was lost somewhere on Hampstead Lane . I 'm coming to get you . And don 't say anything to Orwell . Handle this , will you ? Hey . Hey ! Where the hell you 're going ? I have to help the Super . You don 't just march away from my team without my permission . It 's Winter 's orders , sorry . Why ? He needs backup . We 're about to question Frierson . Where did the tip-off from Becker 's body come from ? You never followed it . I have a manhunt to run . He was your brother . Adopted . How could Vincent let him ... kill my mother ? Why would he let that happen ? If he was a torch , if he loved us so much . Because my father loved him more . Are you going to do this willingly ? Or are we going to have to use ... other means ? I 'll cooperate . Good . Now , come with me . What the hell is going on ? Why are we being kept prisoner here ? It 's for your own protection . Harry 's escaped from Whitecross . What ? Harry would never hurt us . You don 't know Harry anymore . He 's psychologically unhinged . It 's why he killed a man who tried to catch him . I 'm sorry , I don 't believe that for a second . Anyway , that doesn 't explain why all the doors are locked and Mrs Danvers won 't let anyone out of the house ! I 'm just taking precautions . Why did you pay for my firm to take on Kevin Grey 's case ? And ask for me specifically to represent him ? You 're a very smart woman , Anna . Did Harry ever really appreciate you ? Who the hell are you ? I 'm the man you betrayed Harry for . I 'm also the man you 've been looking for at Whitecross . Come on , Daisy . We have to go right now . - What 's going on , mum ? - Come . We 're gonna take a bus home . Come . Come with me . We 're walking to the High Street and we 're gonna catch a bus , come ! - Let 's go outside , Daisy . - Mum ! No ! - I forbid you , bitch ! Daisy ! - Mum ! Not Daisy ! Let me go ! Daisy ! Daisy ! Daisy ! No ! Let her go ! Let her go ! Detective Clayton , I told you on the intercom M. Lermontov wasn 't in . I didn 't believe you . Where are they ? He 's left for his brother 's house in Hampstead . No ! Control to D.S.I. Winter , Anna Clayton 's last mobile phone location is confirmed as Ashton House , Hampstead . AR19 have been alerted and are en route there now . You started all this about Kevin Grey just to get to me . Is Nathan on this too ? Nate is someone I 've run into a few times , a business man . But you planned to get inside my life like this , from the beginning . I thought it was a wonderful romance . You 're insane ! I don 't understand what you could possibly hope to get ! This is something about Harry ! Harry has stolen something from me , and I want it back . He has your money . If only it was that simple . Are you a religious woman , Anna ? You see all the wars in this world are not fought over money or material things . They are all fought ... over belief . More specifically , the primacy of one man 's belief over another man 's . Harry has stolen my right to believe . How did you fall ... for such a broken , worthless gambler ? I can 't possibly imagine . Your brother called . He 's on his way . Good . Harry won 't be far behind . Get them ready . Take her upstairs . I owe you an apology . When I killed your mother , I was ... young , naive . I really understand how much trouble it would cause me later . I will never put that bracelet on you ! Whatever our father ... might have told you in his last days , he didn 't want it to end like this . Vincent didn 't want you NEAR the bracelet . That 's why he always kept you secret . You have a lot of your mother in you . She said pretty much the exact same thing to me 15 years ago . Ashton House is registered to Lermontov Industries . If Golding has Anna and Daisy there , they could be hidden anywhere . Detective Superintendent Winter to AR19 , we 're 5 minutes from Ashton House . What 's your ETA ? 10 minutes . Ashton House , next left , Sir . Mum ! Take your hands off me ! Mum ! Mum ! Please , Nikhail ! Please ! - Please ! - Harry will be here soon . - Give me the keys . - Please , please ! Please , let her go ! Please ! Please , let her go ! Harry ! Alistair ! Harry , it 's OK . It 's OK . I believe you . And I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . OK . NO , HARRY GET DOWN ! SIR ! Sir ! Sir ! Sir , it 's gonna be OK . It 's gonna be OK . God ! Alistair ? Stay with us . Hold on . Hold on . Hold on . DAISYYYY ! Go ! I got this ! D.S. Chohan . Officer down . Shot to the chest . EMS required . ... shooter 's AO . He has Daisy and Anna ! D.S. Chohan , AR19 . ETA , 6 minutes . No ! Stop ! No ! Stop ! Wait . Stop ! Stop ! Don 't shoot ! Truth is , Harry ... I 'm scared to fire this at you . I mean who knows what would happen if I did . Even though I am a crack shot , it 'd probably miss you by an inch , bounce off the floor and end up in my gullet ! Or worse , gun could explode in my face . Please . Let them go . I 'll do whatever you want . No , you won 't . Haven 't you figured that out yet ? What ? The bracelet won 't let you ! It protects your life , in every way that it can . It influences your choices . It is the ultimate survivor . That 's why dad chose the highest building in London and why YOU are going to put this gun in your mouth ... and pull the trigger . No ! No ! Give me the key . - Shoot yourself , - Please ! - and I 'll let her live . - Please , just give me the key ! You 're running out of time to save her , Harry . PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND PULL THE TRIGGER ! OK . DO IT ! Harry ! Police ! Get down ! On the ground , now ! Julian ! Don 't move ! I 've got the Claytons . Let 's go after Julian ! Daisy ! Come on ! Come on ! One , two , three , four , five . Come on , Daisy ! - Come on ! - Please , wake up . Wake up , come on ! Work for me ! Please , work for me ! One , two , three , four , five . Please , wake up . Daisy ! Daisy ! I love you , God !

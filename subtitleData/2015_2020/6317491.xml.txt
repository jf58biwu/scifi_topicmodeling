 Abraham : For centuries , mankind has been the dominant species . We 've domesticated animals , locked them up , Killed them for sport . But a series of recent events seem to suggest All across the globe animals have decided : " no more . " And so we were hired , A team of people from different backgrounds , With different specialities : An expert in animal behavior , A journalist , Safari guide , Foreign intelligence agent , And a veterinary pathologist . Our task : To find out what is happening with the animals , Why it 's happening , And how to stop it . Previously on zoo ... What if your dad was searching for a cure ? Leopards ? Have we ruled it out yet ? Zambia 's largest agricultural company is owned By one of reiden 's biggest critics . That might explain why reiden products aren 't being Used there . I think we just found our needle . We need to get out of the country . How soon you need to leave ? ( siren blaring ) No ! ( groaning ) Chloe ! This one 's all mine . ( yelling ) ( groaning ) This is another trick to get me to talk . No , it 's not , but I 'm risking everything to be here . I need to know you 'll trust me . You shoot that bastard dead , then maybe we 'll talk . ( grunts ) Jamie : Mitch stuck the cub with the needle . His pain sent a distress call . It was just like the lions in l.A. They communicate over long distances . Once we get him back to a lab , He 's gonna save a lot more than that . What happened ? Jamie : Oh , my god . Jackson , you 've been shot ? ! We got to get him to a hospital . ( engine revving ) Looks like we 're ten miles from the hospital . How 's he doing ? ( gasps , groans ) not so good . ( birds screeching ) Oh ! Oh ! That 's the third one in an hour ! Mitch : Yeah , that 's the same pattern We saw when we were in boston . ( coughs , groans ) We 're close , my friend . ( groans weakly ) The blood ... The blood is coming through the shirt . Keep pressure on it- - nice and even . Don 't let him pass out . ( jackson coughs ) maybe we should pull over . Lot of things I can handle in a pinch . Kind of surgery he needs- - not one of ' em . ( leopard cub growls ) The cub is impatient , rafiki . ( jackson gasps , coughs ) You need to give him a name . Maybe a musical name , Considering how much noise he makes . Perhaps bono or bowie ? Jamie : What 's going on ? Where are they going ? Everybody 's leaving town . Could be a million reasons . ( jackson coughs ) You 're worried about your team . I need to talk to them . Reiden will be looking for us . They 'll be monitoring cell conversations . If they find you , They can have an interception team wheels up in minutes . Look , I don 't even know if jackson found the leopard , Or if they made the cure . Or if they 're even alive . I understand . But if this goes well , we 'll have the entire weight Of the united states government behind us . Maybe you should do it yourself . No . You have one thing that I do not . What 's that ? You 've looked it in the eye . This animal pandemic . You 've even managed to get the better of it once or twice . There 's one person here Who can make them believe . And that 's you , chloe . ( indistinct shouting ) ( people screaming and shouting ) ( leopard cub growling ) Grab the electroporator . Oh , my god . That 's why they 're all leaving . ( hissing ) ( growling ) ( growling ) We need to get inside now . ( growling ) Here . ( yelling ) Hey ! Open the door ! It 's an emergency ! My friend needs a doctor ! The hospital is closed . ( alarm ringing ) ( jackson grunts ) ( screaming and shouting continue ) Did you hear what I said ? We are abandoning the hospital . You have to go elsewhere . We don 't have time . This man 's been shot . I can 't help . I suggest you drive him to nyanga . That 's four hours at least ! I have lost a dozen colleagues And more patients than I can count . I am sorry , but I cannot help you . You will help him ! You understand me ? You will help ... ( growling ) ( people screaming ) The last ambulance leaves in an hour . I will do the surgery , But beyond that , you are on your own . Thank you . Doctor : Three units of o-negative And find some morphine ! It started at the edge of town . The lions came first , then the leopards . When did the attacks begin ? Two days ago . They attacked the young and the elderly first , Then the hospitals where they were taken for treatment . It 's as if they were ... Thinning the herd . People are terrified . They 're abandoning the city . I 've never seen anything like this . Man ( over p.A. ) : Evacuation busses will be ... Away ! No ! ( people screaming over p.A. ) I 'm sorry . You can 't come with us . Wait ... Be strong , rafiki . You may want this . Thank you . ( lock buzzes ) The hematology lab should have what we need To extract this little guy 's stem cells , formulate a cure . Hurry , mitch . I think he 's getting scared . ( leopard cub growling ) There . Third floor . We 're heading to hematology . Come on . ( elevator bell dings ) Stay behind me . ( metallic clattering ) ( gasps ) A single set of paw prints . Look- - the teeth went straight through the bone . That means leopards . ( growling ) Which way is hematology ? ( growling ) That way . ( growling ) Come on , little guy . Let 's go . ( growling , snarling ) I would argue that the fearless And aggressive behavior witnessed In these animals is , without question , the direct result Of an airborne virus ... He 's completely wrong . A single-stranded rna virus , Not that unlike canine distemper ... You are their one chance to hear the truth . They 're scientists . Mitch should be talking to them . You don 't need mitch . You 've picked up enough over these last weeks . ... There is only one logical solution : Identifying and destroying these animals that are infected . Thank you very much . ( applause ) Thank you , dr . Brettschneider . Mr. Delavane . Jamie : If they 're out there , I don 't hear them . ( lock clicks ) Okay , pal , I 'm gonna need One of your teeth , so I can extract some stem cells . Uh ... Hand me that rubber heart over there . Why ? Because . No need to hurt him if we don 't have to . So ... I 'll just Take this Rub little flavor on it . Here you go . Ah , I see . You 're going to let the cub remove its own tooth . Exactly . So , uh ... Assuming I can formulate a cure , We 're gonna need an animal We can test it on . Abraham : Even if the cure works , Wild animals still act wild . We 're going to need a domesticated one . That way we have a clear Behavioral baseline . I ... Okay , so ... Don 't open this door until I return . What ? ! No , you ... Abe ! I 'm going to be okay . Jamie : Be careful . You too . My name is chloe tousignant . And up until four weeks ago , I was an analyst for the dgse . My focus was on terrorism- - human terrorism . But I have come to believe that the most serious threat To our survival now comes from the animal kingdom . ( murmuring , whispering ) My team has discovered That there is a genetic mutation Throughout the animal kingdom . How can you possibly account for a mutation , Given the absence of antigenic drift ? Chloe : I don 't know what that means . ( audience murmuring ) But I do know that a virus Brings other symptoms . These animals are healthy And killing them is not the answer . What we 're dealing with is a mutation . Interspecies ? That 's ridiculous . Most of the animals display something Called the " defiant pupil . " An environmental event Of global proportions is happening . My team has risked their lives to prove it . The animals have developed a biological imperative To destroy us . ( murmuring ) if they continue to attack our technology , Which they have done . If they continue to develop Interspecies communication , Which they have done . If they no longer See us as apex predators , Which they do not . If all of this continues , The balance of nature will collapse , And we will be facing A mass extinction event . ( murmuring becomes louder ) a mass ... Extinction event ? Yes . Okay , well , I 've had enough of this . Please ! My team is in africa and they need your help . We need your help ! Mitch : So ... We carted this thing halfway around the world . About time we used it . This is insane . I mean , this thing has to work For any good to come out of all of this . I mean , my mom dying , and ... Or maybe that was a really stupid thing to say , I 'm sorry . What 's it like being human ? Oh , my god . Mitch ... Here 's a tooth . You 're kidding me . Already ? Yeah . All right . Bet you never thought we 'd be saving the world With a tooth and a rubber heart . ( grunts ) I 've been looking for you . How 's jackson ? He 'll sleep for another Hour or two . Check on him then . He 's on the second floor , in post-op . As soon as he wakes , start the antibiotic . The other is for pain . We are gathering the last of the patients . Stay away from the animals . There will be no one left to help you . Thank you , doctor . ( monitor beeps steadily ) ( growling ) Hi . I got here as soon as I could . Oh . You didn 't have to . Of course . I was worried . Yeah , well , I 'm stubborn , right ? Takes more than a bullet to stop me . A bullet , an army of animals , Evil men trying to kill us ... Yeah . We 've been through a lot . Yeah , we have . When they were , um ... Wheeling me into the room , I was thinking about you . ( growling ) ( screaming ) ( crying , screaming ) ( growling ) ( screaming , shrieking ) ( growling ) ( bones cracking ) God , forgive me . I have not been a religious man . But ... If you get us out of this , I promise that will change . Just give me a sign . ( dog barking ) ( tires screech ) ( barking continues ) ( barking stops ) Oh ! Hey ! Easy ... ( gasps ) Easy ... I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Hey ... Bacco 's very sick . It is enough . No more . No , no , no ! No . Stay back ! My brother , please , please . Let me take bacco . I think there is a way I can save him . I 've tried . All of my neighbors Have shot their animals . I 'm the last . Then let me help him . It is a terrible world Where a man has to shoot his own dog . Let me help him . If I cannot , I will do it myself . Come on , bacco . Come on . You 're coming with me . Hey . ( grunts ) Undo the chain , Quickly ! ( screaming , crying ) ( gasping anxiously ) ( leopard growling ) Shh . Shh . ( crying , gasping ) ( crackling ) ( leopard growls ) It 's okay , It 's okay ... It 's okay , I got you . ( grunting ) Shh . It 's gonna be okay , all right ? I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna get you out of here , okay ? ( grunting ) ( growls ) Boy : Bhudhi vangu ! Bhudhi vangu ! Bhudhi vangu ! Bhudhi vangu ! Bhudhi vangu ! It 's okay , it 's okay . Bhudhi vangu ! Huh ? Bhudhi vangu ! Sielewi . Bhudhi vangu ! I d ... Tell him I don 't understand . Bhudhi vangu ! Bhudi vangu ? Ah , wait , no , no , no , no ! Girl : Mukoma . Mukoma . Jackson : Mukoma ? Y-your brother 's out there ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Your brother 's in there ? ( groans ) Good news is ... We got some viable stem cells here . ( cub mewling ) so ... Our little friend has done his part . He 's crying so much . You don 't think it 's a call , do you ? Mitch : Why don 't you try closing the bag ? Maybe he shares my aversion to hospitals . Is that why you dropped out of med school ? No . I never liked hospitals . But I think it was the patients that finally did me in . Will you hand me one of those cuvettes over there ? Uh , which one ? The-the square tube with the lid on it . I didn 't hate the patients . I just ... Hated their pain . Their tears . And their families ' tears . You shut down your emotions for long enough , You don 't want to spend all day with somebody else 's . Does it bother you when I talk about my mother ? It did . When we first met . But ... I 'm okay with it now . I 've actually learned a lot from you , jamie campbell . How 's that for a compliment ? I 'll take what I can get . Is this gonna work ? In theory . ( whirring , beeping ) So , there 's something I got to say . And I better say it now , before this whole thing goes south . I want to thank you . For ... Dragging me into this insanity . You don 't have to thank me . And I want to thank you for Giving me the courage to save my daughter . And for reminding me that ... That it 's okay to feel And ... Look , I know you couldn 't save your mother , But , truth is , You kind of saved me . ( beeping ) ( whirring slows , stops ) All right . Well , here we go . This is it . Hope to god we were right . I have to find jackson . ( leopard roars ) ( gasps ) ( snarling ) ( growling , hissing ) ( growling ) Mitch , wait , the mother cell . ( alarm wailing ) mitch : Forget it . Let 's go . ( leopard growls ) What 's happened ? The leopards . They came after the cub . I know it sounds crazy , but ... Maybe that 's what those birds were doing . Abe , we lost the mother cell . And the cure ? This is it . It 's all we got . One shot , maybe two . Okay . I found a dog , and I put him in one of the patient rooms . If this doesn 't work ... There 's only one way to find out . ( barking ) first , the birds . Now the leopards . It 's no coincidence . They 're after the cub . All right , this is it . No room for mistakes . ( dog barking , snarling ) Ready ? One ... ( barking , growling ) ... Two ... Three ... ( whimpers , barking ) How long does it take to work ? ( barking ) I don 't know . ( barking , snarling ) ( phone ringing ) Hello ? Who is this ? Chloe : Hey . It 's chloe . How is everyone ? Chloe , oh , my god . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . I 'll explain everything later . ( barking ) Uh , we 're-we 're fine . We-we found a cub . Great . What 's that sound ? Where are you ? Uh , we 're at a hospital in harare . We 're-we 're actually testing the cure right now . Wait , where are you ? Washington . Why are you testing it in a hospital ? Listen , chloe , um , Something happened . Jackson got hurt . He 's going to be fine , but-but ... Where 'd you get this ? It 's clean . I borrowed it . I told you not to do that , chloe . It doesn 't matter anymore . They didn 't believe me . This was the one thing I can do to help . And I failed . I 'm sorry . Man : Ms. Tousignant . Mr. Delavane . Would you come with us , please ? ( panting ) ( crying ) Your br ... Your brother 's out there ? Mm-hmm . ( door creaking ) ( curtain rattling ) ( groaning softly ) ( curtain rattling ) ( door creaks open ) ( curtain rattling ) ( panting ) ( soft whimpering ) ( grunting in pain ) : Okay . Okay . Here we go . Here we go . Here we go . Here we go . Okay . Okay . ( panting ) ( growling ) ( growls ) ( grunting , groaning ) ( hisses ) ( grunting , groaning ) ( growling ) ( barking ) If it was gonna work , we 'd have seen some evidence by now . ( sighs ) Sorry , guys . This is all my fault . It 's no one 's fault . Mitch : Yeah , I ... I 'm the one who told you all That the leopard cub was the-the answer . I 'm the one who said the mother cell was the key to the cure . It was just a theory . Not even a theory . Half a theory . Now 's not the time For self-pity . It didn 't work . Tell me why . Okay . Should I start with the fact that I 'm not a geneticist ? Or should I start with the fact That somehow I got it into my brain That a completely discredited scientist By the name of robert oz Was anything other than certifiably insane ? Ancient history . Tell me why you failed today . Easy , abe . He tried . Stop . Let him speak . Tell me why you failed . I don 't know . Why don 't you tell me , genius ? Maybe the mother cell was contaminated . But it 's-it 's-it 's hard , organic substance . So that 's highly unlikely . Maybe the-the ... Cub 's gene didn 't mutate naturally Like we thought it did , but there is no way That it traveled far enough to-to be exposed to reiden , So that 's a big fat no . If my hypothesis ... Is sound , A-and none of the elements were contaminated , Then I don 't know , maybe it 's the-the ... Maybe it was The delivery system . The delivery system ? Yeah . The ... The injection . The-the ... The needle , maybe the needle was contaminated . The ... Or ... Or what ? ( sighs ) Intramuscular injections usually disseminate quickly , but ... But it 's-it 's possible that ... It 's possible it never even made it out of the dog 's flank . And if it didn 't make it out of its flank , Then that means it didn 't get to the brain ... And maybe that 's it , maybe Maybe we need to introduce it orally . ( dog barking ) maybe we need to do that Before the cub 's pack finds us . Do we have enough left ? ( sighs ) we 're gonna find out . And , uh ... Don 't think I don 't recognize what you just did there . ( barking ) ( dog snarling , barking ) Sorry , buddy . We need you one more time . ( snarling ) Got him ? Yeah . Yeah . ( snarling , barking ) ( snarling ) ( barking ) ( snarling , barking continue ) Mitch , I don 't know . I don 't think it 's working . ( whines quietly , pants ) ( whines , pants ) ( dog whining ) Good boy . Good boy . ( whines , whimpers ) ( relieved sigh ) ( laughs ) You better find jackson . We got to get this stuff home . ( electronic whirring , beeping ) ( door unlocks ) Sorry for the cloak-and-dagger . We haven 't been properly introduced . My name is amelia sage . Those scientists didn 't believe you , But I do . And so do the people who matter . ( quietly ) : Jackson ? Jackson ? Abe . ( panting ) : Abe . Ah . ( chuckles ) how are you , man ? I was so worried . I 've said some things over the last few days ... What you said ... You were right . That little boy in there , the only thing That mattered to him was his brother . I 've been a lousy brother . I made some dangerous choices . You tried to give your life for me . It was a dangerous choice , But a good brother . The cure ? It worked . You were right . ( wry laugh ) ( laughs softly ) We got to get out of here . The lobby 's this way . ( ferocious growling ) ( quietly ) : Oh , my god . Don 't move . ( growling ) ( growling ) Do we run ? No . If we do , they 'll take us down . ( leopard roars , growls ) ( roaring , growling ) ( glass shatters , gunshots ) soldier : Trank ' em ! ( indistinct talking ) Soldier 2 : Secure ! Soldier 3 : Unit two secure ! Extract ! Soldier 4 : Lock it down . Secure the perimeter . How long have you known about the problem ? Let 's just say that two weeks ago This room ... Didn 't exist . Amelia : Many of the things You said to the working group corroborate my team 's discovery . The ocular change , for example . You call it the ... Defiant pupil . We call it The delta determinate . It 's an anomaly of the pax-6 gene , But a rose By any other name ... We didn 't know about the gene . We didn 't have the resources . Well , you did just fine without them . My team 's just started to research this problem . Your team is already close to a cure . Resources are the enemy of imagination . Einstein ? Delavane . ( chuckles ) Amelia : Well , mr . Delavane , You 'll be happy to hear That instead of facing criminal charges , Your team is about to become heroes . Hopefully ... The kind of heroes that can save the world . You 're not alone . Not anymore . Mitch : Not that we 're not incredibly grateful , But where the hell did you guys come from ? Sergeant : We 're the 74th special tactics squadron . Our orders are to get you out of here . Okay , listen , there were two others with us . They 're-they 're still ... Look ! Jackson ! You look like hell . ( chuckles ) Thanks . Jackson : Hey , listen , up there with me , There were three ... Three kids . Already on their way to nyanga . We 'll track down their parents . How 'd you know we were here ? All I 'm authorized to say is your location Was provided by a french national . But we 're gonna get you to johannesburg , And from there on a flight to dc . I made a promise . Can you spare two men to take him back home ? You serious ? Yeah . Go on . Soldier : Let 's move . Yeah . Let 's go , let 's go . Yeah . ( jet engines whirring ) ( call system chiming ) You know , I made a ... Great many promises to god in zimbabwe . You gonna keep ' em ? I think all but one . Did it involve women ? ( chuckles ) : No , it involved hamburger . And it was made in haste on your behalf . I think you 'll be making your own promises from now on . Oh ... No , no , no , no . No . As soon as we land , Hamburger , two cold beers- - not negotiable . ( chuckles ) Uh , please tell me That after everything we 've been through , You guys aren 't seriously gonna eat a hamburger . Oh , I 'm eating the hamburger . ( chuckles ) How 's the cub ? He ate half my dinner and fell asleep . Would you mind watching him for a sec ? Hi . Hi . I was just pilfering some of these ... Adorable little bottles that haven 't grown up yet . Would you like one ? I would like nothing more . Well ... Well , what ? How many animals do you think have nearly eaten us ? ( chuckles ) Um ... Well , to be fair to them , they wouldn 't have eaten us . They 'd have just killed us . That 's right . So ... We did pretty good , right ? Yeah . Well , considering we didn 't have ... ¶ ¶ ( thumping , rattling ) Captain ( over speakers ) : Uh , ladies and gentlemen , This is your captain .

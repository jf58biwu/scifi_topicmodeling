You 're the only one that could help ! Get the fuck away from me ! Please ! Logan ! Who was that ? I don 't know , some crazy lady . Don 't worry . As I live and breathe , The Wolverine . And he is a junkie now . Who the fuck are you ? You know , You got some buck shot on your door . I heard you was in Phoenix . But then last night some friends of mine from Texas called Told me they found 3 dead cholos in the pool out on 54 . Nothing unusual , I know . Except one missing a hand , another one a leg . So they was thinking ... It was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Kruger . But neither on of them can drive ... One being fictional and the other one extinct . And since the wheel marks they found belong to a 24 Chrysler ... well ... This is a 24 Chrysler . She found you yet ? Gabriela ? You see ... I 'm not looking for you , Wolvie . Well , not really , I 'm looking for someone who 's looking for you . She took me something of mine when I wasn 't looking . Something for which I am responsible . A Mexican lady Does it ring any bells ? I don 't know any Gabriella So get the fuck out of my car . You know , I know what you hiding , amigo . The old Cuban , south of the border What do you want ? A little cooperation . I am a fan , by the way . Alkali Transigen Fuck ! Fuck ! No , Mr. Esperanza . No . I know I said june , but I need the boat now , Why would that mean the price go up . Listen to me . I know you want 70 ... Ok . What if I can put together $ 45,000 in cash right now ? Hello ? Hello ? Shit . Hey , Sam . Good Morning . " I see in you that virtue , Brutus ... " As I see your external appearance . " Well , honor is the theme that will speak " . He 's having a bad day . They 're all bad days . He needed these six hours ago . This is not enough , you know . Won 't see us through the week . I 'm working on it . Your turn . I had a rough night . Poor you . In other views he told me , last night he was communicating with someone . He 's not talking to anybody . Don 't be so sure . He has got all these details . I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier . - It has got cracks in it . - Please stop . Paul Left . You 're not listening . He 's been asking questions again . About why we are here . I think he 's trying to read my mind . That 's what these are for . Friends , I have good news for you today ! It 's not about what you do . It 's not about your deed . You gotta do what you gotta do . He knows that you can 't . It 's okay , we are imperfect . Make way , sir . I said make way ! The new " quesalupa " , from Taco Bell ! Curry with chicken , Curry with steak When the cheese melts right inside . It 's the next big thing . Go now , and surprise her ! Who are you ? You know who I am . You 're the man who puts me to sleep . We could both use some sleep . No , no ! No , no ! What are you doing to me ? Charles . Please . How long I have been here ? What are these ? You 'll remember what they are . Shots stop the seizures . Pills keep them from happening . I want you to blow on them to make them safe . Fuck off , Logan . Oh so you remember who I am now . I always know who you are . It 's just sometimes I don 't recognize you . Take the pills . You leave me alone with that fucking albino . He doesn 't listen to me . I know a damn speciation when I see one . What ? Speciation , a new mutant , a young one . - There are forces trying to kill them . - Forces ? They want help . Forces , forces . Too bad you are not in that business anymore . They do not want me , they want you . Oh yeah ... That 's how fucking stupid they are . They 're waiting for you on the Statue Of Liberty . Statue of Liberty was a long time ago , Charles . Long time . There are no new mutants . You understand ? There is not a new one born in 25 years . Not anywhere . You 've always thought ... We were part of God 's plan . Maybe ... May be we were God 's mistake . What a disappointment you are . When I found you ... You were pursuing a career as a cage fighter . You were an animal . But we took you in . I gave you a family . They are gone now . Logan . What did you do ? What did you do ? Answer me ! Why are we here ? No one should live like this . Drugged in a fucking tank ! - It 's for your own good . - No no , it 's not ! You 're waiting for me to die . I don 't want to fight ... but there 's things we need to discuss . What things ? Would it be considered nagging , If I was repeat my previous observation ... that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures ? It 's what the guy gave me . I was not in a position to make demands . I almost died this morning . - That seizure ... - It was barely a minute . It felt a lot longer than a minute . I couldn 't breathe . You are less affected . You know he needs a higher dose . And I know you got more money squirreled away . That money is to get us out of here . No , not us . You and him . You 're saving to buy a SunSeeker . Sun is the key word . I hardly see myself cowaring below deck like Nosferatu Do you ? Folding your underpants , And making him spotted dick . Found this in your pocket . Adamantium . If you 're planning to blow your brains out ... Could you wait till you 're at the high seas ? - I just mopped these floors . - I don 't need this shit .

You are not sleeping You don 't wanna talk about that . Or the booze your drinking . Or the pus that you are waiting to wipe on your knuckles . Or the blood I wash in your clothes Or the fresh wounds in your chest . The ones that aren 't healing . And I 'm pretty sure .. You don 't want to talk about the fact that you can 't read the label on that bottle . It says Ibruphen . That 's my favorite mug . Stay out of my shit . Something is happening to you , Logan . On the inside you 're sick . I can smell it . Best night ever ! Hey , driver . I love you . I love you . You are such a doll . Mr. Logan . Jesus . Please . We need a ride . I am not available .

Go inside , now ! You can turn around , asshole . This is private property . Yes it is . In fact , I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company ... based in Shanghai . Where are you keeping the old man ? Is it over there ? Or over there ? That would be smart . I would like to meet him . I 'm told the agency classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now ? Damn shame what happened back in east . He 's been dead for years . I need the girl . What girl ? The one that goes along with that ball you 're holding . There is no girl here . I know you went to the motel . Yeah , I was called there . There was no girl . Just a woman . Just a woman . Such as she was . So ... you saw Gabriela . But you didn 't call me . That hurts . You didn 't shoot the poor thing , did you ? - No , did you ? - I asked you first . - I don 't like guns . - Of course . I wish you caledl me , Logan . Like I asked you . See ?

Text me where you are . We 'lll pick you up . Si , si . Logan . - Logan . - Hey . Hey ! You will get it back after I try and figure out what you and your mother got us into . - No , Logan . - What ? I don 't ... I think that ... Logan , the woman that you met is not her mother . - So she talks ? - We are communicating . Communicate . Take these now . We have to get out of here . It 's not safe here anymore . And you can 't have an attack out there , you understand ? Yes , but this is the mutant that I told you about . - She needs our help . - She 's not a mutant . - Yes she is ! - What 's her gift , Charles ? Eating ? Pipe throwing ? It 's okay . Oh yeah .

Why don 't you tell me where the girl is first . Or I can ask him . He seems quite friendly . I told you she 's not here . Where is Caliban , motherfucker ? I left him in the same ditch he was gonna leave me . Jesus , Wolverine . Seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart . Go get her . Laura ! At it girl ! Hey baby . Laura ... Laura ! Honey , you wanna stay where you are . You want to see your friends , right ? Commander , stop . You said alive or dead . Laura ! Laura . Laura . No no . Move ! Now ! Move ! Now ! Stop shooting .

Follow him , let 's go . Sit back . Bring me the tracker . You . Who the hell are you ? Hey ! I asked you a question . Who are you ? You know who she is , Logan . No , I don 't . Does she remind you of anybody ? I read about you when I was a kid . I believe you think of someone else , Now if I 'm not mistaken , you used to work for my team . You were helping round up all those old mutants . What changed ? You got religion ? I 'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys ... and track one more special mutant for me . I 'm not helping you . Of course you would say that . But I 've got a theory that people don 't really change . Beware of the light . Caliban , I bet that 's what your mama told you everyday when you was a kid . Beware of the light . Let 's not bring out the worst in each other . The girl is not worth it , trust me . She is not a natural fuck up , like you . She 's a business mistake , RD going bad . There 's a liability . They can 't have things with their patents running around hurting people , can they ? We need to get her off the board before she hurts anybody else . Someone you care about , maybe . So get to sniffing . My name is Gabriela Lopez . I 'm a nurse . And for 10 years I worked for Transigen research in Mexico City . Transigen is combined American company . What I 'm about to show you is illegal ... in the US and Canada . They told us we were part of a pharmaceutical study . But of course , that was a lie . These children were born in Transigen . They were born here ... and have never left . They have never seen the sun or the ocean ... rain or snow ... or any of God 's creatures . They have no birth certificates ... No names ... Besides the ones we have given them . They were raised in the bellies of Mexican Girls . Girls no one can find anymore . Their fathers were ... Special seeds in bottles . Birthday ? We do not dress them up for halloween . We do not call them baby , or kiss them . Don 't think of them as children . Think them as things ... with patents and copyrights . - Comprende ? - Si seneor . They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand . We are poor , yes ... but we are not stupid . Use your powers . This is business . They are making soldiers . Killers . These are babies and mutantes ... North Dakota . You took that woman 's money . You said you would take the child there . What is she ? She is your daughter , Logan . Alkali has your genetic code . Not just mine . Logan ... I do not want to talk about it , I don 't wanna hear about it anymore . - Logan ... - Just stop . I have to pee . Last ride . You 're welcome . Stop it for God 's sake , I can do it myself . Yeah , well , you 're not doing it . Just get on with it . Not with you standing there . Trust me , I 'm not looking . Hello ! Hi there ! You know you got to pay for that , right ? Hey ! Where 's your mommy and daddy huh ? Come on . That 's enough . These too . Shit ! Not okay ! I am sorry . Cell phone chargers ? Come on . Get in the car . As the children became older ... Laura . Laura . They became more difficult . They could not to be controlled . The company made their bodies into weapons . They tried to teach them to kill . But they did not want to fight . A soldier who will not fight is useless . Inside this building ... They are working on something new . Something they think is better than the children . Something they say , is without a soul . They must have been successful . About week ago , they told us to shut our programme down . So we are putting the children to sleep . We are going to save as many children as we can . I read about a place up north . A place for mutants . They call it Eden . If you 're watching this ... It means that I 'm dead . I am not sure if any other children survived . We were separated . There is no more money . That was a lie . She 's not my child But I love her . You may not love her . But she 's your child . Please . I beg you ... Take her to safety . Is this where we 're hiding out ? We are not hiding out . We 'll get couple of hours sleep ... clean up , get some new clothes , get a new ride and get out of here . Harrah 's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to the Oklahoma City . Hey . Endless fun at Harrah 's Casino . Hey , leave it out in front , alright ? Come on let 's go . Hey , Laura . Let 's go . We need clothes . Going up . No , no , stop . They are not a toy . - No , no , sorry . The chair . Okay . - What ? Thank you . Come here . Stay there . Stand there . Logan , that 's yours . What ? Not here now . Just in the room , we 'll get changed in the room . This is a very famous picture , Laura . It 's almost a 100 years old . I first saw this picture in the Essoldo cinema in my own town ... when I was at your age . You are in Heaven , hallowed be thy name . Thy Kingdom come , thy will be done ... Shit . Do you read these in your spare time ? Oh yeah , Charles , We 've got ourselves an X-men fan . You do know they are all bullshit right ? Maybe a quarter bit happens , and not like this . In the real world , people die . - And no self promoting asshole in a fucking ... - Logan ... This is ice cream for bed wettters . Logan ... Your nurse has been feeding you some grade A bullshit . I thought that Laura needs reminding of life 's impermenance . Didn 't you say something about finding us a new ride ? Two more pills in one hour . Give them to him . Why , Shane ? A man has to be what he is , Joey . Can 't break the mold . I tried it , it didn 't work for me . Joey , there is no living with a killing ... There is no going back from it . Right or wrong , it 's a brand . A brand that sticks . Now you run home to your mother and tell her that everything is alright . There are no more guns in the valley . Who are you guys ? More cops ? Cause I told the other guys ... CLOSED Get up ! In your cage , tracker . You did your job . Fellas . Shit . Help yourselves out . Say what . Eight grand ... I 'll have her freshly painted for you ... New tires , mounted , balanced and complete paperwork . I 'll give you ten as is , if you can forget the paperwork . Well , you still need new tires man . How long will that take ? An hour . Jesus . Oh you gotta be fuckin ' kidding me ! Sir , are the keys in it ... ? Sir ! You have the keys in it ? Sir ! Shit ! Charles . CHARLES ! Going up . Shit ! You alright ? We gotta get out of here . I am so sorry . I am so sorry . Emergency personnel is still ... At Harrah 's Casino and Hotel in Oklahoma City where at least 400 guest was striken with temporary paralysis yesterday . Similarity to the Westchester incident over a year ago That left over 600 injured ... And took the lives f several mutants including several of the X-m Knock it off . I said knock it off ! She 's a child , Logan . And point of fact , she is your ... How long did you recently take your meds ? - Tell me , how long has it been ? - Don 't know ! Two days . You saw what happened yesterday . If that shit had gone on any longer ... I did what I had to do to save Laura . You didn 't do anything . You just freaked out and had a fucking siezure . I think you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated , rambling on like a lunatic . So much easier for you . Easier ? Jesus ! There is nothing easy back here . Charles , Nothing ! Yes , yes , please be like the rest of the world ... blaming someone else for your boring shit . I know pa , I am such a giant disappointment . You honestly derive no sense of purpose from what we are doing ? Okay , what are we doing ? Huh ? There is a young mutant sitting in our car . Yeah . And where we are taking her , there are others . Does that mean nothing to you ? Oh yeah , yeah it means nothing to me . Especially since nurse Gabriela ... made all that eden shit up , off the fucking comic books . What are you talking about ? Give that to him , take out two pills and give that to him . Logan , Logan . Give it to him . Now ! I wanna see it . Dr. Rice ... Motherfucking auto trucks . Language Logan ! And you 're screaming at a machine . She can go at a man with a feet but she can 't hear a few naughty words ? She can learn to be better . You mean , better than me ? Actually , yes . And by the way , Laura 's foot claws are ... the obvious result of her gender you know . Is that a fact ? In a pride of lions , the female ... is both the hunter and caregiver . Good to know . She uses her front claws for hunting ... and the back claws defensively . Oh yeah ? Thus ensuring their survival . Hey hey ! We should help them . No , we have to keep going . Someone will come along . Someone has come along . Alert , alert . Hey , you need a hand ? Ready ? Go ! Good , got it ! Let 's get home . Laura ! Thanks so much for help . - I 'm Kathryn . - James . He 's my son Nate . - Hi . - Hi . That 's your daughter ? Yes , that 's Laura , and that 's my dad ... Chuck . Come on , Laura , let 's go . Well , can we show our appreciation ? Treat the three of you to a decent meal ? We don 't live not far from here . - No thanks . - That would be lovely . My name is Dr. Rice . But you can call me Xander if you like . My colleague tells me that you 've been somewhat resistant . He believes that you 've been dispensing delayed information ... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead . I 'm offering you a possibility of redemption , Caliban . to protect the world and in the process , save your friends . The girl is a rather small price to pay for that . Unlike you , she isn 't pure . She wasn 't made by nature . She 's a mistake of own ... I did what I could and they burned me and beat me . Your colleagues are savages . I agree . The Reavers were very ineffective ... but I 'm bringing new tools to bear . But I still need someone to point us in the right direction . No , I can 't help you . Please , please . What does he have ? The old man ? Alzheimers ? ALS ? A degenerative brain disease in the world 's most dangerous brain . What a combo ... Uhm , thank you God for this food ... And for our new friends , the Howletts . They came to our aid . - Amen . - Amen . Here you go . Thanks . Well , there is plenty more if she wants . She 's fine . Thank you .

If we take trips around the country , who is gonna take care of this place ? Exactly . I say let it go . And live up where ? The Lord will provide . I 'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me a new Thresher . Honestly , I 'd love to travel someday . And I bet you will . - I can drop out of school . - Ok , let 's not go to that far . I 'll do it . - No . - Why not ? - You wanted to travel , I wanna travel . - Son . Son . It 's the perfect ... Now , why do you want to do that , Nate ? Careful , you 're speaking to a man who ran a school ... for a lot of years , right Charles ? Well , yes . It was a ... It was a kind of special needs school ... That 's a good description . He was there too . Yeah , I was in it too . I got kicked out a few times . I wish I could say that you were a good pupil , but the words would choke me . Well ma 'am , I can 't thank you enough for this . Really , it was great . But we have a long drive ahead ... But you need to rest , don 't you ? Yeah , we 'll find a motel . The nearest one is two hours and it 's not even that nice . We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter ... and you can sleep in the living room . Kathryn , that 's very very nice of you but we should go . We can leave early in the morning . Right at dawn , is it good ? Ok , why don 't we wash up Pa ? Okay . Sit down . Sweetie , you want some dessert ? Two days on the road , only one meal , hardly any sleep . She is 11 and I 'm fucking 90 . There is 101 reasons to keep moving . I 'm not a box of avocados , Logan . We stay the night , then what ? Then we take her to her friends in Eden . And then we buy the SunSeeker . Take the pills . Shit ! - What 's going on ? - Nate ! Fill the tub before we lose pressure . Honey , check the sink . They are not going to leave this , will they ? You might as well handle it now . Can 't it wait till morning ? Cause it rained last night . We have three guests and a sink full of dishes . Alright . Alright . The pumping station that supplies us is mile and a half away from here . Sometimes it get itself shut off . - By assholes . - Hey ! No . My son is happy to go with you . No , no that 's fine . The men that do this sometimes they can be ... - I can go . - No , do your homework . Okay , I 'll go . Just I need to get my dad settled . Alright . You want TV ? There is TV here . No thank you . Get some rest . You know , Logan ? This is what life looks like . A home , people who love each other . A safe place . You should take a moment and feel it . Yeah . It 's great . Logan . Logan ! You still have time . Charles , the world is not the same as it was . We 're taking a risk , hanging around here . And where we 're going , Eden ... doesn 't exist . Her nurse got it from a comic book . You understand ? It 's not real . It is for Laura . It is for Laura . Get some rest . Canewood beverage bought everything out here except for us . We wouldn 't sell , so they tried eminent domain . They 're screwing with our water . A couple of months ago , somebody poisoned our dogs . So out on the highway today , with those trucks ? Who knows . Maybe . Hey , look up . They are like dinosaures with 20 tonnes bodies and tiny little brains . Chopping of all corn to make syrup . And it all tastes like shit too . Why do people eat it ? The don 't . They drink it . Corn syrup . It 's in those drinks everyone is having ... to stay awake , cheer up , feel strong , sexy , whatever . Used to be a time , when a bad day was just a bad day . Mine are still are . Those are for breakaway roping . These are for barrel racing ... and right here this for pole bending . They are all second and third place . I 'm not too good at it , but my dad makes me . Do you want to listen ? You like it ?

Hey , how long your daughter 's been like that ? Mute . Since the beginning . In a lot of ways , I envy you . When they get to be Nate 's age , the nonsense that comes out of their mouths ... Makes you wonder the whole point of it all ... Shit . Don 't worry . We won 't need it . Stay here . Good evening , Mr. Munson . What brings you out this way ? You should ask your boys . Mr. Munson , you know that you 're tresspassing right now , right ? I had an arragement with the previous owner of the property . Bullshit . Previous being the operative word . Who is this ? It 's the guy who tells you to get back in your nice truck . Go to play hokey dickhead somewhere else . Hey , Carl ... Looks like Mr Munson hired some muscle . Looks that way . He is a friend of mine . A friend with a big mouth . I hear that a lot . Then you probably hear this too . More than I 'd like . Then you know the drill .

This is not the first time I 've hurt people . Until today , I did not know . You wouldn 't tell me . So we just , kept from ... running away from . I think I finally understand you . Logan ...

I always hoped ... that I get the chance to meet someone like you . There is so few of you left . Nice to meet you too , doc . But I really gotta get on my way . No , do not do that . What you need is rest and treatment . You need to check yourself in somewhere . - I 'll be fine . - No , you 're not ! I know that you 're different ... but that doesn 't change the fact that inside you is poisoning you . You 've got to check youself into a hospital . Find out what it is . I know what it is . Please Mr , if you don 't want to go to a hospital , maybe I can help you . Maybe I can run some tests . Look , Doc . You seem like a nice guy . If you want to save a life save your own . Forget we were here . Let 's go . Hey ! Hey ! You can 't just take shit , you know ... I don 't know how you got me here but .. Thank you . Yeah . You can talk ? You can talk ? What the fuck ... ?

What ? North Dakota . Shit , Look ... This place . Yeah ? Your nurse , she read too many stories , you understand ? Too many stories ! I 've seen it ! I 've seen it , okay ? This all here ... None of this .. none of this exist in real , ok ? I mean this Eden does not exist . No no . It 's a fantasy . Can 't you see that ? Those are the names of people who made this ... They made this whole thing up . Okay ? this whole .. It happened once , and they just turned it into a big fucking lie . All this is . No ! Fuck . No . I know , I understand . This is a long way . You understand ? I am not taking you to North Dakota . I am fucked up . I can not get you there . That is a two days drive . And no I 'm not taking you ... You hit me ! Don 't hit me ! Stop saying those names . Stop saying them . Stop saying those names . Stop it ! Stop ! Fuck ! Fine , fine , fine ... You wanna go there ? I 'll take you there . See for yourself . Fucking fantasy land . We understand the importance of containment , Dr. Rice ... but you can 't leave a war zone behind like you did in Juarez . Try to remind yourself these are all killing machines . Machines that would happily disembowel your family . Not all . I was told you want these assets off board . Dead or alive . Are you chaning my brief ? No . Alright then . Save tissue from this one . He 's good tracker , high IQ . Here you go . North Dakota Hey . Let me drive . Absolutely not . Quit looking at me . You 're dying . You want to die . Charles told me . What else did he tell you ? " Do not let him . " Hey , hey , hey ! Rest . Keep it stable . Swing it towards me . Easy , easy . Is this good , Rictor ? No , not so much . Less . Hey ! Where am I ? Hey ! Where did you get that ? Where we came from . They gave it to us when we were fighting . It makes you stronger . It makes you crazy is what it does . It 'll kill you . Not if you use it in small doses . It 's helping you heal . Where is Laura ? She is sleeping down there . You want me to wake her up ? No . You had a nightmare . Do you have nightmares ? People hurt me . Mine are different . I hurt people . You know what it is ? It 's made of adamantium . It 's what they put inside of us . So it could kill us . Probably what 's killing me now . Anyway ... I got this a long time ago ... and kept it as a reminder of what I am . Now I keep it to ... Actually , I ... I was thinking of shooting myself . Like Carles said . I have hurt people too . You gonna have to learn how to live with that . They were bad people . All the same . It 's not funny . That 's not funny ! Hey ! Hey pops . How long have I been out ? How long was I in that bed ? Two days . Go and tell them to get packing . You can not just stay here . We had to wait . It was the plan . And everyone had till today to find their way here . If you keep waiting , Alkali will find and they kill you all . You need to get out ! We are leaving tomorrow before dawn . We gonna cross the border . It 's a safe haven . Same coordinates ? Yes , between noon and five . Satellites are blind then . - Your asylum is approved . - Copy . Swing it to your right , Laura . A little more . Yeah . Do you see the woods ? Si . That 's an 8 mile hike from here . And you see that pass ? That 's the border . That 's where we will be safe . Come inside . Laura told me what you did for her . She was lucky to have you . Take it . She says it 's yours . It 's why you did it , right ? Yeah , well ... Look , I don 't need it . You do , okay ? Suit yourself . Your friends , they seem nice . Kind of reminds me of ... Hey , hey , what 's going on ? You 're with your pals . You made it . Where will you go ? The nearest bar to get started . Hey , I got you here . That 's what all I stand up for . I even gave back the money . Such a nice man . Hey , I never asked for this . Alright ? Charles never asked for this . Caliban never asked for this . And they are six feet under the ground . I don 't know what Charles put into your head ... but I 'm not whatever it is you think I am . Okay ? I only met you like a week ago . You got your Rebecca , your Delilah ... your blah , blah , or whatever Everything you 've asked for you 've got it . And it is better this way . Because I suck at this . Bad shit happens to people I care about . You understand me ? Then I 'll be fine . Run ! Run ! Run , Bobby , run ! Go ! Go ! Go faster . We need to reach them before they get to the border . Move out ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! I want you to breath . Just a flesh wound , baby . There she is ! We got her ! Back off ! Stay behind me ! You took all the medicine . It 's wearing off . Go with your friends . Go . Laura ? You 'll know when . 9'o clock ! That green juice is wearing off , huh . You know , for an old mut that was a kinda short high . Be hard to keep your claws out sometimes . Waste this dick , Logan ! Please stop , Mr. Howlett . We gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children . You don 't want that . Concede that the effect of the serum is wearing off . You will not survive further wounds . Allow me to introduce myself . Zander Rice . I believe you knew my father in the Weapon X program . Yeah . He 's the asshole who put this poison in me . Yes , he was one of them . I think I might have killed him . I think you 're right . Why don 't you show some respect , muty . Your 'e looking at the man who wiped out your kind . My friend Donald overstates . He makes it sound more brutal than intended . The goal was not to end mutant kind ... but to control it . I realized we needn 't stop perfecting what we eat and drink ... we could use those products to perfect ourselves ... to distribute gene therapy discretely through ... everything from sweat drinks to breakfast cereals . And it worked . Random mutantcy went the way of polio . When embarked on our next endeavour ... Growing mutants of your own . - Precisely . - These are dangerous times , James . You can 't Show time , boy ! Get up , boy ! Get up , boy ! He did that . Get up ! Laura ! No ! Laura ! Go . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Get out of here ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! GO ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Run ! No ! No , no . No , no . Take your friends and run . No . They 'll keep coming . Listen , you don 't have to fight anymore . Go ! Don 't be what they made you . Laura ... Laura ... Daddy . So this is what it feels like . No ! No ! Daddy ! Daddy ! A man has to be what he is , Joey . Can 't break the mold . There is no living with a killing ... There is no going back . Right or wrong , it is a brand . A brand that sticks ... Now you run home to your mother Tell her everything is alright . There are no more guns in the Valley Let 's go . We gotta move .

 OSCAR : OK , this is how it all started . Four kids with nothing in common got lost in a forest and ended up in an alternate universe where they were never born . Bummer , right ? That was Felix 's fault - my brother . He discovered that hidden inside some people are elemental forces that can be used together to create powerful magic . Felix is a fire element . He controls the living flame . Andy is the brainiac of the group . His element is water . Sam is air - in element and in nature . Jake is earth . Solid , dependable and normal ... sort of . Then there 's me - Oscar , the spirit that holds everything together . I have kind of magical visions . Fighting demons and each other , they finally found their way home , bringing with them a magical talisman , and discovering a secret lair hidden in Bremin High School . But who bum it ? And why is it there ? You 're never gonna give up , are you ? FELIX : Has to be a clue in here somewhere . - Too bad they didn 't leave a name tag . ( Felix sighs ) How can someone leave all this but no clue of who they are ? Agh . I need more light . OSCAR : Felix ! Careful ! FELIX : Oops . Lucky I 'm a water element . I hope those spells aren 't crucial to the survival of the universe . Knowing my luck ... Even if we can 't find the owner , this is still the perfect headquarters . - For ... ? - The greatest magic group of all time . Not sure if you 've noticed , Felix , but Jake and Sam are only interested in themselves these days . Yeah , and Andy 's off on some top-secret nerd quest . He 's barely even at school . And without all four elements , no magic . They 've just been busy . I 'll get ' em back . We 're a team . What if it 's time for a change , Felix ? You 're fire , I 'm water . If we find new earth and air elements , we can form a new team . And dump the others ? Technically they 've already dumped you . No-one 's dumping anyone , OK ? - A secret compartment . - In a secret compartment ! That 's a lot of secrets . ( Chuckles ) ELLEN : A Book Of Shadows . FELIX : Ancient . Cool . - It won 't budge . - Need some girl power ? - ( Strains ) FELIX : Why won 't it open ? Magically sealed . Whatever 's in there must be good . Insanely good . So , how do we open it ? This is just what we need . Make sure you film me putting the vanguardium into the magnetic field . Andy , I know . Where the ley lines intersect , there is an increase in ambient magnetic fields . The vanguardium acts as a sensor . My research says this has to be it . Your research ? This is it ! The camera ! My studies linking science and magic will change the foundations of scientific knowledge , the very way we see the world . Why aren 't you filming ? Look ! Andy , who discovered the ley lines in the first place ? Who told you about these intersections ? Me ! Well , yes , your data has been very helpful . Can you hear yourself ? You 're an egomaniac . ( Phone rings ) It 's Felix . - Why is he calling you ? - Because you never answer him . Agh ! Maybe he can film your experiments , 'cause I 'm done . ( Phone continues ringing ) ( Cheering and applause ) MIA : Yeah , right ( ! ) That was mad , bro . Sick move . Well , what 'd you expect ' ? ( Chuckles ) And that 's it . My first pro video with Gleamer . I 'm super excited to be a pan of the crew . Mad props to my brand-new Gleamer board . I couldn 't do my tricks without it . - Welcome to the family , kid . SAM : Sweet . - I 'll be right back . MAN : Do your thing . Mia ! Where are you going ? Really , Sam ? You asked me here to admire you , using your powers ? Well , yeah . No , I-l mean ... I mean ... Hurry , rescue him before he says something intelligent . Please sign my board . 20 bucks for selfies , 10 for phones , pencil cases and T-shins . ( Phone rings ) - How much to sign body pans ? - That 's just weird . MAN : Right . That 's the last of it . Woo-hoo ! Exciting , hey , Jakey ? Hey ? - Yes . - Fresh start . All going to work out beautifully , mate . ( Phone rings ) Go on . We 'll finish up here , won 't we ? - Yeah . - Go see your friends , Jake . It 's cool , Mum . I 'm just stressed . I 've got to get to training . The scout 's coming tomorrow . I want to be on top of my game . OSCAR : When the boys went to the other universe , Andy met an alternate version of Ellen , and they fell in love . Since coming back to this universe , things have been ... well , awkward . Guys . Uh ... hey , Ellen . Hey , Andy . Uh , been a while . I didn 't realise you 'd be here . Phew . I was worried this whole love triangle thing had lost its weirdness . FELIX : This is it . Fascinating . You think whoever this belongs to created the lair ? Has to . I can 't open it . I 've got spells to go to other dimensions , to create scrying pools . - You think opening a book 'd be easy . - ( Chuckles softly ) What ? You coming to me for magic advice . It feels like a personal triumph . I could have figured it out myself . Eventually . Oh , give me a break , both of you . ANDY : I think I can help . OSCAR : Ooh , laminated . That 's your Book Of Shadows ? I got pretty deep into researching traversable wormholes on the web . The web ? So you found a spell written by a Harry Potter fan ? Magic and technology don 't have to be at odds . Not every spell is composed by candlelight and quill . I found an unlocking spell . This could work . With a bit of Felix Ferne pizzazz . Who 'd have thought ? You two long lost lovers together again . Let me know when you open it . I 'd like to see it . Where are you going ? You 've already got a water element for your spell . You don 't need me . Oh , Andy , come back . It 's your spell . You do it . The next one 's mine , OK ? Let 's give them some man time . Wait , why do I have to go ? 'Cause I 'm not gonna be the only one that misses out . We 're still going to need Jake and Sam . I 've tried calling them . We might need to be a bit more persuasive . Oh , nice one ! Scout 's gonna love you . ( Phone rings ) COACH : Well done . Your phone 's going mental . Probably an emergency or something . ( Phone bleeps ) ( Phone rings ) What is it , Felix ? FELIX , ON PHONE : Jake , we got a situation here ! If you idiots have gotten yourselves into trouble ... - Just calm down ... COACH : Riles ! - We need your help ... ( Phone bleeps ) You wanna win this scholarship , you need to focus . Yes , Coach . Riles ! Where are you going ? Riles ! ( Chuckles ) It 's comfy . - I wanna catch this light . Ready ? ( Phone rings ) - I was born ready . - Good . Redheads phone . FELIX , ON PHONE : Demon emergency ! Get here quickly ! There 's someone yelling about a demon or something . It 's just a ... it 's just a private joke . - My weirdo friends . I 'll be right back . FELIX : Sam ! Sam ! I know it 's been awkward between us since you got back . It 's not your fault . I 've kind of been focused on other things . It 's just ... the four of us have been through so much together . Sucks to lose that . This emergency better be good . I just skipped out on the single most important practice of my life . - It is an emergency , I swear . - Alright . Who do I put on blast ? Why is your jacket so reflective ? It 's fashion , Andy . - But is there a functional reason ? - Well , it doesn 't need a reason . - I 'm modelling it . - You 're a model ? Of what ? Zit cream ? Guys , we 're a team , remember ? You said this was a life or death emergency , remember ? OK , I was a bit dramatic , but it 's kinda life or death . For our magic . Felix found an ancient book in the lair . If we can open it ... - The magic we could have ... - Wait . What ? We 're here so you can play with magic ? No , Jake , I can 't open this without you . I need the four of us to cast a spell . It 's ... I thought this book might help us . What 's gonna help is me not missing my footy trials . I just want to get my scholarship and get out of Bremin . Yeah , dude , I 've got my elemental power . Who needs the drag of talismans and magic spells when I can just do this ? ( Wind whooshes , bird squawks ) I 've spent months trying to find the owner of the lair . This book could hold the answer . Please , I need your help . And if we open the book , no more hand holding ? - That 's the plan . - Then we 're done ? I guess . Let 's get this over with . ( Blows ) Before we begin , I wanna say , all four of us , together again , it 's great . Really . I mean , we should ... JAKE AND SAM : Hurry up ! - OK . OK . ALL : Keeper of wisdom , heed my call Transcend your bonds and reveal to all Earth , water , air , fire . ANDY : The talisman ! Well , that was unexpected . I knew this book was going to be special . ( All grunt ) ls it too much to ask for things to go right for once ? Argh ! ( Both grunt ) Felix , what the hell ? ! Dematerializing demon ! Intriguing . - Focus , Andy ! - I got this . I got this ! - Hopeless . Sam , get the talisman . - Hurry ! OK , let 's do this ! ALL : Water , fire , earth and air Elements that we all share Water , fire , earth and air Elements that we all share . ( Sighs ) Another Felix Ferne epic fail . If we 'd worked together ... Did you burn my eyebrow off ? You did ! JAKE : It 's twisted . The most important game of my life tomorrow and my ankle 's done . - I had no idea that would happen . - How many times have we heard that ? We did succeed in opening the book . Yeah , but I 'm down one eyebrow . Sam , no-one cares . My fans care . They want two of ' em ! - Felix ! JAKE : Your fans ? Are you kidding me ? You 're right ! This Book Of Shadows , these are the most complex spells I 've ever seen . Incredible . With this magic , we 'll be stronger than ever . No . No more magic . No more ... this . I 'm sorry , hombre , but in case you haven 't noticed , we suck together . JAKE : Can 't believe I 've done my ankle today . - Andy ? - Well ... I am curious . But you 've got Ellen as a water element . But if we 're not together , we can 't do magic spells . JAKE : That 's the point ! Not necessarily . This is a spell of separation , so we can do magic individually . We can break the bond between us ? Guys , wait ! ( 50th groan ) There 's one problem , though . What is it ? We have to destroy the talisman . Thanks , guys . This means a lot to Felix . His life is kind of meaningless without magic . Thanks , Andy . If I do this , you 're giving me a spell to get my eyebrow back , right ? You can do the spell on your own . I don 't know , guys . Doesn 't it seem crazy , splitting the talisman ? You didn 't seem so worried when you let a light demon loose on us . Felix , to unbind us , we have to split it . But it protects us . Imagine , Felix . Our own magic . It 's the only way . ALL : What was four shall be one And what was one shall now be four Bind the elements to each shard And hold the power of them all . That 's it ? What now ? I suppose we take one each . No , thanks . - I 'm done ... - Come on , Jake . Just remember what we 've been through . Ah ... ( Groans ) We 'll still see each other at school . Unless you get your scholarship . Be back on weekends . We can share our findings , right ? Swap spells ? Yeah , I guess so . - Sol guess ... - That 's it , then . FELIX : Quick man hug ? ANDY : You think ? JAKE : It 's not really necessary , is it ? Then there was one . ( Eerie whispering , ominous whooshing ) OSCAR : There is so much hidden beneath the surface of our world , so much that we don 't see or understand , like Negative Space - a place that exists in between universes . For a while , Andy was lost there , but then he met Bear , the Guardian of Negative Space . Bear keeps all the craziness of the multiverse in order . But to do that , he needs human help . His latest recruits are our friends , Phoebe and Alice . Imagine a galaxy . Good . Now imagine the cosmos . I could get used to this . BEAR : There 's something wrong . A disturbance ? More than that , I fear . I can 't see anything . Why are the shadows spreading ? They 're hiding something . Order must be restored . Let me go in . Another disturbance . Your turn , Phoebe . Maybe we should wait for Alice . I 'm ... I 'm new to this . You are a Guardian . It is your duty . Don 't be afraid . I 'll power you . Better not drop me . ( Chuckles ) ( Laughs ) Oh ! Oh , that tickles ! Order must be restored . ( Laughs ) ( Operatic singing ) - Someone 's having a good time . Dad 's speciality - rubbery pancakes and music by dead people . You look wrecked . I feel worse . How 'd it go ? We opened it , but in the process , we kinda broke up . Sorry . But maybe it 's a good thing . There 's so much magical potential in Bremin that all we have to do is find two new elements . And then we can form our own team . We 've still got the talisman . Actually ... something else happened when we opened the book . ELLEN : You broke the talisman ? FELIX : I have to show you something . Elements reveal and show What I seek What I must know . ELLEN : What ? A scrying pool ? You 're doing magic spells on your own ? Felix , I still need three other elements to do magic , remember ? What about us ? - What about working together ? - Oh , I didn 't mean for that ... It didn 't occur to you ? What it would mean for me ? I 'll help you find the other elements . Don 't bother . It 's clear I 'm not that important to you anyway . - I get that . - Wait , I 'm sorry . I didn 't think that ...

I 'm back ! Andy ! What are you doing ? I had to come back. ls that bad ? It 's insane . I know , right ? My own Lorentzian traversable Wormhole . - Smooth . - ( Chuckles ) Don 't let anyone see you . You 've got no idea the chaos you guys caused last time .

( Phone clicks ) Straight onto Instagram . Keep the tweezers . This book . It 's amazing . There 's incredible power in here . Just no clues as to who made it . Who would leave this behind ? Maybe the book will tell me . What was it ? What did you see ? Two kids , holding each other . And , wait ... I saw a symbol . ( Draws ) FELIX : I 've never seen that before . I saw something else . In the lair . A man . He made this place . Who ? It was so fast , I only got a glimpse . I just never thought Felix would be so selfish . They 're so painful since they got those powers . VIV : Tell me about it ! Andy 's nuts . Watch where you 're going , feral . Newbie . - She 's barefoot . - Probably homeschooled . So , what are you going to do , then ? Avoid him until I graduate . ( Thunder cracking ) - Um , weather alert . Thanks . What gets me is , if we had powers , there 's no way we 'd waste them . Come with me . There 's something I want to try . Where is it ? - This means we 're brothers . - I 've never had a brother . Me either . This is gonna be fun . Ans and crafts ? This is how we find out which element you have an affinity to ... I think . - I could just ask Andy to help . - No boys . Just hold your hands over the bowls . See if you feel something . - Ommm ! - ( Chuckles ) Take it seriously ! - I don 't want to be mud . - It 's earth . If it 's your element , we might be able to activate your magical potential . You 're at the wrong one . - And you are ... ? - Try the empty bowl . - That 's not supposed to happen . - You 're fire . Whoa ! I 'm like a human microwave . This is all wrong . Elemental powers don 't just happen . ELLEN : Not so easily . - What makes you so sure ? Maybe we 're just advanced . I did skip a year of primary school . And I 'm definitely more evolved than my brother . How fun is this ? Who are you ? I 'm Tegan . ( Rumbling ) GIRL : Earthquake ! Earthquake ! What was that ? - You control earth ? - Mm-hm . I 'm just like you guys . That means we 're the four elements . Fire , water , air and earth . So we can do magic . I don 't know . Sure we can . We just need to find a Book Of Shadows . When you said you had a plan , I was presuming that plan would involve a bit more adventure and excitement . The lair has to have been set up by someone at school , right ? A former student . Oscar . Felix . This is a rare sighting . Oh , excuse me , boys . A bit of light weekend reading . A teacher ! There 's nothing magic about Bates . Keep looking . Whoa , check it out ! It 's Dad ! With hair . So much hair . - And a vest . - Pretty much the same vest . Look . ' Favourite subjects - Music , Physics , Woodwork and Kathy Connor . ' Mum ! That 's embarrassing . That means teenage Mum 's in here somewhere too . Wait , wait , what are we doing ? We 've got to focus . He has to be here somewhere . Let me try . Feel anything ? ( Stomach growls ) Hungry . It 's so cool having girlfriends again . VIV : Girlfriends are the best . It was crazy . I had a whole crowd . It got crazy . Did a 720 . - Who is that ? GIRL : You 're amazing . The vainest person in Bremin . I can 't believe I went out with him . He was your boyfriend ? In another life . Let 's have some fun . Should you blow him a kiss ? ( Wind whooshes ) - ( Grunts ) ( Girls chuckle ) ( Rumbling ) ( Grunts ) Oh , my God , Tegan . That was wicked . ( Chuckles ) Sweet prank . Who did it ? - Earthquake . VIV : Came out of nowhere . - Riles ! ( Girls chuckle ) I 'm gonna bring the pain . ( Chuckles ) You found the source of the disturbance ? No , sorry . I was just very ticklish . It 's getting worse . There 's another disturbance . More of the darkness ? No . We know this one . My friend has crossed dimensions . Andy ? You think it 's connected ? - His timing 's more than coincidence . - Then he might know something . What ? Oh . Order must be restored . You know what helped when I was trapped in Negative Space ? Candy Crush ? Thinking about you . Does that make you feel uncomfortable ? No . Not at all . I came back here ... for you . - Oh , no ! - You don 't want to ? Yes . I mean ... no . I mean ... - What is that ? - Restoring demon . Run ! ' Andy ! ' Eh ! Sorry , I know I shouldn 't be here , but in terms of magical disruptions , I 'm pretty benign . You know better than anyone you can 't disrupt the natural order . OK , starting to freak out here . There 's a darkness spreading across the multiverse . Shadows . What 's that got to do with me ? Bear thinks you can help . Have you sensed anything strange in your world ? No . Well , nothing more than usual . So there 's been no magical disruptions ? Actually , now that you mention it , there was this one thing . ( ♪ Smooth rock music ) ( Blows ) ( Thunder rumbles ) - What ? ! ( Chuckles ) I 'm sorry , Felix . The visions are so unpredictable . It 's not your fault . You tried . It 's like it 's right here . I could see a person but their face was ... blurred . Maybe you 're being blocked . By magic . BOY : Like a thunderstorm , man . - That was weird . GIRL : Like a heatwave . GIRL 2 : It was like a climate change or something . FELIX : The girls did this ? Who is that ? - What did you find ? - The talisman . The boys found a powerful spell . They divided it . - No . - What does that mean ? It means we must act - quickly . ( Whistle blows ) ( Shouting and cheering ) Who 's that ? Jake . MIA : Why ? - He 's not the one . - What one ? Wait . Are you guys alright ? Yeah . Tegan 's just so cool . I know , right ? She 's the best . Stop . We need to talk . JAKE : Scouts . Don 't look so desperate , Riles . It 's embarrassing . Will ! Jake ! Open ! Give it up ! Man on ! Pass it , Riles ! Ohh ! ( Rumbling ) Oh ! ( Whistle blows , horn blares ) I was completely open , Jake . I don 't know what happened . I ... I never miss a shot like that . Tell me you didn 't just do that . Payback hurts , doesn 't it , Riles ? Payback for what ? You just can 't handle my success . You just ruined my life because you think I 'm jealous ? Of course you are . Of what ? A bunch of primary school kids that like your hairstyle ? SAM : Loser . It 's like a documentary I saw about elephant seals . Can you guys stop bickering ? There 's more important things happening . Do either of you meatheads know why the girls suddenly have elemental powers ? - And who 's that new girl with them ? - What , that girl ? She 's the one who said you earthquaked me . We 've been played . Wait here . PHOEBE : That 's the disturbance ? The little feral blonde ? Tegan . She 's free ? ALICE : Who is she ? A problem only we can solve . ALICE : What do you mean ? - Go . We need restoring demons . - We have to tell Felix what 's going on . - What does Felix care ? He left you to make your own magic , remember ? Why is it good enough for them and not for us ? Hi . I 'm Tegan . I don 't know what your story is , Tegan , but we need to talk . Oh , that 's pretty . Can I look ? Don 't touch that . Manners .

Oh , no ? I 'm just starting . Don 't think I 've forgotten what you did to me . Or forgiven . - Ow ! - ( grunts ) - No , no ! Someone will see . - In this mess ?

In my world , that girl . It 's total chaos . Andy , I can 't leave here . Really ? That 's a shame . Remember this ? Of course . Our friendship band . You trust your friends , don 't you ? That must be nice . I had someone I could trust once . Andy ... ( Speaks foreign language ) ( Andy and Tegan speak foreign language ) The band ... ANDY AND TEGAN : Isn 't from Negative Space . So you can 't control it . Tricky , huh ? Why ? You thought you could just forget me ? Forget who we are ? What are you doing ? I have to keep the multiverse in order . - Without it , there 'll be ... - Total chaos ? Hmph . You abandoned me for this world . Now you 're going to watch me tear it apart . Order will not be restored . Not this time . She 's stronger than anyone we 've encountered . She controls all the elements and the restoring demon . And she 's coming for us . So what do we do , then ? Some spell to banish her ? That symbol . My vision . When I touched the book , I saw this . This was at the ley lines . Burnt into the ground . FELIX : Where we opened the book ... ANDY : And split the talisman . Then Tegan turns up . - What if ... - We brought her here ? They 're doing that finishing each other 's sentence thing again . - Mm . - But who is she ? I 've read about this . Chaos Sigil . 'Against order is the force of chaos . The two exist in a balance . If chaos separates from order , the spiral of destruction leads irreversibly ... ' What , are you gonna say something cheerful like ' the end of the world ' ? Not just this one . Every world in the multiverse . She wants this book . There must be something in here she 's afraid of . We need to find it . And now that all four of us can do magic , watch out chaos . Whoops .

Andy , if anyone can handle out-of-control craziness , it 's you . You think ? I know . Ellen , I shouldn 't have come back . I was too caught up wanting to be near you . Will I ever see you again ?

Ellen , please , I don 't want to hurl you . You 're so blinded by your arrogance , you can 't see what you 're up against . - Ellen , I 'm on your side . - I know . She wants the book . You have to give it to her or she 'll destroy you . We can 't . We need it to stop her . You are magic , you idiot ! No . Order to chaos and chaos to order The circle of life The endless border ... You 're not powerful enough , little fire element . Reveal the secrets To banish shadows to light Open the door To cast out the endless night . TEGAN : Oh , the olden days . ( Chuckles ) Want me to step through your little trapdoor and get lost back in time ? Not likely . ( Rumbling ) Wouldn 't it be more fun if I just ... crushed you ? I don 't think that 'd be fun at all , actually . ANDY : Leave him alone ! Sweet revenge , yo ! Are you for real ? That 's just annoying . Game over , boys . Time to give me the book . ( Wind whooshes ) - Stop . You can have it . Andy , no ! Let us go , we 'll leave you alone . Finally . We need to get out of here , quick . You little creeps with your backyard magic . ELLEN : What is it ? What did they do ? You let them trick me . You said you were my friends ! - We are ! Tegan , please calm down . - You 're kinda scary . They can use the book against me . Leave Mia and Viv . They 're just slowing us down . We 'll get them . Me and you . BFFs . - BFFs ? - ' Best friends forever ' . Yeah . BFFs . You wasted what I gave you . Enjoy being normal again . It 's just us now . BFFs . Now for those annoying boys . ( Speaks foreign language ) ( Thunder cracks ) - ( Speaks foreign language ) ( Guttural growling ) - Nice trick with the book , dude . - It was Ellen 's idea . Ellen ? She 's not under Tegan 's influence ? - She 's pretending . - Then she 's in danger . Yeah , welcome to the club . Wasn 't that spell supposed to take Tegan out ? I thought so . But it only opened a portal . To another universe ? No . I 'm sure it was to ours , but , like ... back in time . A temporal slip . Interesting . Looks like chaos had another win . You could say that . We got smashed . Wait . Tegan is chaos . So we need to ally ourselves with order . We have to get back to Negative Space , to Bear . And get stuck there like you did ? Bear can help us . Tegan can 't get the book if we take it with us . What about Ellen ? The girls ? The best way to protect them ... is to KO Tegan . Spread out further . The spell won 't work unless we 're completely separate . - What about now ? - Keep going . SAM : Dude , I 'm gonna go into a pool . Elements obey me Heed my call Become the power The source of all . ( Wind whooshing ) - It 's working ! You actually did it ! ( Tegan chanting in distance ) What 's that ? SAM : I don 't know , but , suddenly , going into Negative Space doesn 't seem like such a bad idea . - Um , guys ... - What is that ? ! ANDY : A shadow . Felix , use your fire ! - Guys ! - Hurry , it 's closing ! Guys , don 't leave me in here ! This place freaks me out ! Don 't be scared in there , Sam . Negative Space is what you want it to be . - Sam ! ( Guttural growling ) I think we should worry about ourselves right now . They aren 't after you , just the book . Use your power . Guys ? Hello ? Phoebe ? Alice ? Bear ! Come on , guys , where are you ? Where are you ? ( Gasps ) Whoa ! Run ! We 're surrounded . Through there . That 's the only way ! Well , here they are , Ellen . Your real friends . Tegan , wait . We 're BFFs , remember ? Oh , yeah . Remember this , BFF ? ANDY : Ellen , I 'm on your side . ELLEN : I know . I 've been betrayed before . I swore I would never let it happen again . Tegan , stop . It 's us you want . Don 't worry , you 're next . Stop . It 's going up in flames . Unless you let her go . Do it . Save me the effort . She wants it destroyed . Time for another plan . Felix . How are your footy skills ? - Don 't let him go ! ( Guttural growling ) TEGAN : I want that fool 's Book Of Shadows . - Whose book is it ? - Really ? You don 't know ? Jake ! That wasn 't so hard , was it ? Can you get up ? Just . Those things , they sapped my energy . No . No ! Come on ! This will buy us time . Hurry ! The book is gone . He is gone . Nothing can stop me . Now begins the age of chaos . ( Thunder rumbles ) ( Speaks foreign language ) ( Continues in foreign language ) ( Manic hissing and whispering ) Don 't stew about the boys . They 're just teenagers . They should have been there . It 's like they live in their own universe . Yeah , well , I was the same at their age . I thought you were brilliant on stage . The boys would have been proud . Thanks , hun . ( Tegan chanting in distance ) You know what ? They can come to the next show . We 'll be better then anyway . Kathy ? Kath ? Alice ! Phoebe ! Bear ! ALICE : Sam ! Here ! - No ! - What ? ALICE : Stop ! PHOEBE : Stop ! PHOEBE : She 's destroying Negative Space . How did Andy survive in this nutso place ? How do I get to you ? ALICE : Think ! Felix and Andy were the thinkers . Is there a Sam-style solution to this ? OK , brain . Andy said that this place is what you want it to be . What did he mean ? PHOEBE : Sam , you have to ... I have to what ? Where are you ? ALICE : Over here ! ALICE AND PHOEBE : Here ! Here ! Oh , man , Felix 's stupid big fireballs would be great right now . At least I could see . GUYS ! Guys ! Fireball . I think fireball and one appears and ... That 's what the little dude was on about . In that case , a bridge would be nice . Sam Conte . Skateboarder , genius , saviour . ( Siren wailing in distance ) Give me something . Let me help . Stupid power . Are you OK ? I 'm a lot of things , but OK isn 't one of them . I 'm so tired of running . Anyone else wish they had their driver 's license ? Yep , Andy , that 's exactly what I 'm thinking about . ANDY : She 's affecting the whole town . - Her power 's increasing . - There 's nothing we can do about it . - But there 's still Sam . - Fair call . - She 's destroyed The Book Of Shadows . - Game over . ANDY : We 've failed . I 've failed . JAKE : Come on , guys . This is the grand final . The fourth quarter 's when we play our best game . We have to dig deep if we 're gonna smash it through the posts . - Is he serious ? FELIX : Afraid so . Jake 's right . This is our chance to do something good . Something only we can do . How ? The spell didn 't work . We 're not giving up . ( Phone rings ) Oskie . My hand started drawing by itself . FELIX : What ? OSCAR : The lair . There 's something in there . You have to go back . ( Sirens wailing ) Let 's go . Hey , Oskie , have you seen your mum ? Um , no . Where did you get this ? ( Speaks foreign language ) ( Continues in foreign language ) ( Thunder rumbles ) ( Chuckles ) Fun ! Search everywhere for another spell . A backup spell . Fast . Come on . - It could be anywhere . ELLEN : Doesn 't make sense . Why leave a spell to defeat Tegan unless someone could find it ? I 've searched in every corner of this place a thousand times . I would have found it . Felix . When you did that spell before , it created a portal to our dimension , but at a different time . So , what if what we 're looking for isn 't here now ? But it was here before . It was the right spell but I cast it in the wrong place ! I have to do it here . OK , you need to leave me for the magic to work . Everyone out , hurry ! - You did well , Sam . - Thanks , dude . Me and my brain have come to a new understanding . - Good luck with that . - We must hurry . No , wait . Now I need your help . You gotta help us take care of Tegan . It 's not possible . Bear can 't leave Negative Space , Sam . We must repair our world to keep the rest in order . But she 's trying to destroy Bremin . If Negative Space falls , that will be the end of everything . I ... I can go . Um , well , I was kinda hoping for someone with actual powers . And I was hoping for someone with gratitude . Looks like we 're stuck with each other , airhead . ALICE : What is it ? It 's all my fault . I 'm responsible for this . You know , I never thought I 'd say this , but ... this not doing magic together thing kinda sucks . Come on , Felix ! What 's taking so long ? FELIX : Guys ! Oh , man . ANDY : Behold , the Spell of Containment , written on the wall years ago . That 's the real spell to defeat Tegan . A spell hidden within another spell . Whoever thought of that must be some kind of genius . Oh , it 's chaos out there . Dad ! It 's ... not what it looks like . She 's back , isn 't she ? What ? This room . It 's Dad 's ! You made this place ? - You 're the ... - One and only . But how ... what ... Questions later . Mr Ferne , is that your spell ? Oh , that 's an ancient one . I defeated her with that spell 30 years ago , when I was your age . You built all this ? Well , I got straight A 's in Woodwork . But I gotta warn you , boys . You use this spell and it comes at a high price . Why do I not like the sound of that ? Well , like all most powerful spells , this one demands a sacrifice . A sacrifice ? Your magic . Your elemental powers . Everything . Forever . Everything ? Forever ? That 's why I gave up this place . And I hid my identity with the last of my power . That 's why I couldn 't see you . Had to start all over again . Luckily I also had quite the talent for retail . So , what are you gonna do ? I 'm in . All of it ? Forever ? It 's the only way . Ow . I guess . Looks like she 's busy . ( Horn toots ) Guess who 's back ! ( Chuckles ) - Look who I brought . - Hi , guys ! - Phoebe . - You made it . I know , right ? How sick . What did I miss ? ( Speaks foreign language ) JAKE : She 's here . FELIX : You were right , Dad . 'Course I was . Do me proud , son . She 's opening up the barriers between universes . Tegan , stop . This world is our home . And now it 's mine too . So I 'm making some improvements . There 's only one improvement to make - getting rid of you . Well , look who 's here . You got old . A nobody who lost his powers and has nothing to show for it . - I 've got my family . - Do you ? ( Thunder cracks , wind whistles ) FELIX : Mum ? OSCAR : What 's happened ? ANDY : Mum ? Don 't hurt them . I don 't think it 's us hurting them that 's the issue . JAKE : Listen to me ! Mum ! - It 's me-Jake ! - Mum ... ( Grunting ) Ooh ! ( Speaks foreign language ) We need to help the boys . Tegan 's growing in power . - We need to take her out . - And soon , or we 're all cactus . Let 's crush this nutjob ! Remind me not to make her angry . ( Grunts ) ( Thunder rumbles ) The Kombi , hurry ! - What , we 're going to run them over ? - Jake , Jake ! Go ! Go ! FELIX : Hurry , Jake ! KEN : Felix ! FELIX : Hang on , Dad ! It 's time . Fun 's over , Tegan . Oh , please , it 's only just starting . Got it ? Go ! ( Guttural growling ) Stop them . Earth , water , air , fire Elements that we desire ... Earth , water , air , fire ... - Elements that ... - We desire ... Take this magic from inside ... ALL : And use its power to chaos bind ... - It should be working ! - What 's wrong with our magic ? ( Screaming ) Help ! Hurry ! Oscar ! Spirit ! We need spirit ! Of course ! Oscar ! We need you to find the talisman ! All the elements together ! Earth , water , air , fire ... - Elements that ... - We desire ... - Take this magic ... - From inside ... And use its power to chaos bind ... No ! No ! Stop it ! No ! It 's not fair . You 've worn out your welcome , Tegan . Why can 't you just let me have fun ? ALL : Earth , water , air , fire Elements that we desire Take this magic from inside And use its power to chaos bind . No ... No , please , don 't send me back ! I don 't want to be alone again ! Bear You 're burning up . You have to go back to your world . I disrupted the balance of chaos and order . Now I must restore it . You ? When the universe was born , chaos and order were the same . United . I was the one who broke us apart . I was the one who betrayed my sister , to have my own identity . To become the Guardian . That psycho is your sister ? I 'm sorry . Please don 't leave . We will be together . Chaos and order as one . Eternal , as it always should have been . What about Negative Space ? The multiverse ? The multiverse existed before me and it will long after . I thought we were the Guardians . Not anymore . Not without Bear . So we 're free to return home ? Forever ? Come , Tegan . Now we go home . I 've missed you . ANDY : Bear . No ! So , um ... that was intense . Hey , guys , I think you might be forgetting something . MAN : Where are we ? I feel horrible . WOMAN : How come we 're here together ? ( All speak at once ) - What 's going on ? So ... no more magic . Just normal . Perfectly normal . Group hug ? ( All chuckle ) You 've gotta admit , that 's kinda sweet . You 're OK . I 've been looking for you . The whole town went crazy . Go get her , Sam . So I guess you decided what kind of guy you want to be . Yeah , I did . I hope you like him . ANDY : What are you going to do , Felix ? I don 't know . I 've been into magic for so long , I 've forgotten what I 'm like without it . I liked being a freak . Don 't worry . We 'll be freaks together . VIV : As if you weirdos have a choice . Give me a minute . Maybe it 'll be good to be normal again . For a while . You sell yourself short , Felix Ferne . You don 't need magic or powers to be special . You are already , and I , for one , am a big fan . OSCAR : The Nowhere Boys story , at least the magical part of it , may have ended . They didn 't know it at the time , but they weren 't the only ones . All around us there are others like them , like me , who will soon discover the secret powers within them , who are going to follow in Felix , Sam , Jake and Andy 's footsteps . This story isn 't an end . It 's a beginning . Captions by CSI Australia

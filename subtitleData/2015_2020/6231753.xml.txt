 Molly : My name is molly woods . I 'm an astronaut . My husband john , a robotics engineer , Created a lifelike robot called a humanich . We adopted the prototype as our son . His name is ethan . Everything changed when i went to space On a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . I 'm pregnant . How is that even possible ? The child- - part human , part alien- - Was unlike anything the world had ever seen . How did you get so big so fast ? And he was dangerous . Eventually ... Run ! ... I lost both of my sons ... Ethan ! Mom ! ( train horn blaring ) ... And my husband . Some people say i 've gone crazy . This is a cover-up ! That 's what this is ! Get your hands off of me ! I say there 's more to the story . It 's up to me to find the truth , Before it 's too late . Previously on extant ... To your best knowledge , No alien life-forms Have set foot on the planet earth . Are you sure he 's dead ? He was dangerous , molly . John : Ethan ! Mom ! Agent : The humanich has been declared The property of the u.S. Government For reasons of national security . He 's not property , he 's our son ! When am i going home , julie ? This is your home now . We think you 're not quite ready for re-entry . Dave : You hear about that woman ? Her belly blown open ? I am really not a lunatic . Say the lady that broke out of crazy acres And then trespassed onto my crime scene . Molly : I think I might know what happened here . Richter : That 's a court order , And she 's a material witness In a homicide investigation . I 'll have her back in 72 hours , No worse for the wear . Want to tell me what the hell this is about ? This isn 't a murder investigation . It 's an invasion . How are we , shayna ? The seal team is in position , Awaiting your orders . Put it up on the big screen . Seal ( over radio ) : Bravo team in position . Seal 2 : Alpha team ready to breach . Status ? Target has been confirmed . We 've got him surrounded . Sir , alpha team is ready to breach . Awaiting your go . Right . Send them in . That is a go . Alpha team , go . Seal : Move ! Move , move ! Northwest corridor is clear . Enemy contact , second floor southeast . We 've got eyes on the target . That is a visual match . You are clear to engage . Seal 2 : Let 's see your hands ! Do not move ! Put your hands up ! What are you doing ? ( seal groans ) ( gunfire continues ) wait ! Stop ! Gun down ! ( gunshots continue ) aah ! At your six ! They 're turning on each other . Shepherd : Get ' em out of there . Alpha team , stand down . Disengage and fall back . If you can hear me , alpha team , Disengage and fall back . Do not engage the target . ( gunfire continues ) Abort mission . I repeat , abort mission . ( gunfire continues ) ( rifles fire ) Ready . Aim . Fire . ( gunshots ) Ready . Aim . Fire . ( gunshots ) Present ... Arms ! What 's going on ? It 's molly woods . She 's out . ( engine roaring , tires squealing ) Molly : Where are we going ? Back to the recovery center . Why ? I don 't believe In little green men with ray guns . And neither do i ! The minute you start talking about aliens , We go back to the funny farm . Okay , then what happens to your case , sherlock ? ( engine whirrs , powers down ) ( tires squeal ) All right . It 's time for your meds . Maybe it 'll make the martians go away . Nope . Not taking them . ( sighs ) Look , i signed you out of crazy acres , Which makes me responsible for your actions , all right ? I can 't have you running around Like some kind of drooling maniac . So ... Take your damn pills . Oh , come on . If you signed a drooling maniac out of crazy acres , That 's because i 'm your only hope to solve this case . So if you want me to help you , And tell you how i know she was pregnant , for example , Then i have to think clearly , And that means no pills . Start talking . Feed me first . ( laughs ) Julie : Ethan , breakfast ! So , i know it 's not the weekend But i broke down and made chocolate chip pancakes . I 'm having whipped cream on mine , don 't judge me . How 's your new room ? I had to look on three different web sites To find that comforter . It 's not the same . Well , it 's not exactly the same , But it 's pretty close , don 't you think ? Pancakes or cereal ? Dealer 's choice . I don 't want any . Come on , they have chocolate chips in them . I hate chocolate chips . You do not . Come on ... Before it gets cold . I said i don 't want any . Fine . What do you want ? I want my parents . ( sighs ) Ethan , we talked about this . That isn 't possible right now . Your dad is gone . But my mom 's still alive . Yes , but she 's not able to take care of you right now . But i can go home when she 's better , right ? We 'll see . But for now , in the meantime , You 're doing great here . You have your room and your games And your toys and ... Pretty soon , it 's going to feel like home . But it 's not my home . It is for now . Well , i hate it . All right , get dressed ; we 're going to work . I 'm not going . Ethan , get dressed ! You 're not my mom ! Can i get you anything else ? Coffee ? Tea ? Rack of lamb ? ( mouth full ) : No , i 'm good . All right . Let 's try this again , shall we ? How 'd you know she was pregnant ? I recognized the symptoms . From where ? And please , don 't tell me " aliens . " An old friend . An astronaut who was impregnated in space . Impregnated by who ? Well , you just told me not to say it . ( laughs ) Oh ... Okay ... You do know that i was an astronaut , right ? Well , i 've spent lots of time in deep space , Doing experiments on organisms and how they adapt and survive . And when i was out there , i came across this ... Alien spore . And somehow , it may have Made its way back to earth . Let me get this straight : You 're telling me that my perp is a spore ? I can 't put a spore in a lineup . If that alien spore Infected a human being And then , that human being ... Is impregnating women ? How would we know ? Blood sample . From the victim . I can get that from evidence . It 's got to be from when she was pregnant . ( chirping , beeping ) ( explosion in game ) How 'd you get a game on here ? I reprogrammed him . Ethan , you 're not allowed to reprogram the tutor-bots . His name is richard . " richard " is for learning . I want you to put him back the way he was . Ethan , i said please put ... Charlie : Hey . Julie . What 's the black widow doing here ? Oh ... Can you ? Yeah , yeah , i got him . Go . Anna ... What a pleasant surprise . Richard , buddy , you 're gonna have to keep it down . Ooh , get that one . Get that one . ( explosion in game ) ooh ! I was expecting a build verification two weeks ago . I know . I understand there 's been Some growing pains with the new staff ? It 's not just the new staff . It 's all new concepts and processes . Ethan had almost a decade of programming By experience of human interaction , and we 're trying To give lucy twice that much in a fraction of the time . We 've skipped over Every safety protocol john would 've taken . All right , no disrespect to your predecessor , But we don 't have the luxury Of doing things the old way , julie . I need to see a test . Today . Uh ... ( laughs ) That 's impossible . We 're still fine-tuning the ethical adaptor algorithms . They didn 't even exist when ethan was built . He learned right and wrong from us . This humanich 's learning from an equation . Okay , julie , I am sympathetic to your situation But if i don 't show my superiors some progress , They will find someone else who can deliver . You know that 's the deal . You have until tonight . ( explosion in game ) The ... 16th . That was the first and last time i saw her . She 'd done a home version of the test , But she wanted to know for sure- - please don 't touch that . Did you do a blood test ? No , never got the chance . She decided to terminate . But she never showed up for her appointment . That was the last i heard of her , till i ... Saw the news . Richter : And there was no mention Of the father at all ? She seemed determined to deal with it alone . I 'd say there 's a good chance it was a ... Casual acquaintance . A one-night stand . Richter : Okay . Well , thank you for your time . Did she mention anything unusual about her pregnancy ? ( clears throat ) You know , legally , You 're bound to tell us anything That could be relevant To our murder investigation . There were , uh ... Complications . The baby 's growth was accelerated . Yes . And at first , i thought , well , Maybe she 'd , uh , miscounted the weeks . But i was on metro-mednet ... What 's that ? A vr chat room for docs in the area . There was a colleague across town asking advice ... She has a similar case . There 's another one ? All right , when did you talk to her ? This morning . There 's your next victim . We need her to trust us , okay ? If her baby has the same father , She can give us a description . I know how to conduct an investigation . And , by the way , i 'm the investigator , You are the sidekick that doesn 't talk . You have control issues . Are you zoe grant ? Yes . Detective richter , special patrol . What ... What 's this about ? I 'm in the middle of a homicide investigation . We think the father of your child may have Some information regarding the case . Can i help you with something ? Man : Once you fill out the online form , They use a matchmaker algorithm to pick your ideal mate . And then you set up a coffee date In the reverie meet-and-mingle lounge . So you don 't actually meet face-to-face . Man : Not at first . Only your avatars . We like to say it was love at first byte . With a " y . " mm . Seven years and counting . Richter : And now you 're gonna be parents . And was , um ... Was this pregnancy planned , or-or ... ? Man : Complete accident . But a happy one , of course . We-we , we planned to wait Until genetic selection procedures were more accurate . Man : Gen-sel would have made sure the baby had her eyes . Oh , god . Oh . Oh , gosh , i 'm so sorry . No , it 's fine . Um ... No biggie . I 'll get a towel . Molly : Zoe ... Mike 's not the father of this baby , is he ? Molly ! What ? You don 't have to tell him , But you do have to tell us . You could be in real danger . All right , take it easy . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Zoe ... The baby is growing too fast , isn 't it ? A-a-and you 're starting To see dead people from your past , aren 't you ? Who are you people ? If you don 't terminate this pregnancy , You are gonna die . Who 's the cop ? Richter , jd . Took her out on some sort of provisional court order . Toby , we can 't contain this much longer , Not with her running around out there . People are beginning to ask questions , internally . I have a meeting with taylor later , to assess our options . In the meantime , find out everything you can About this richter . Will do . Are you worried ? About taylor ? About molly . You have a bit of a soft spot . She 's been through a lot , But that 's not your concern . If it compromises the objective , then it is my concern . Don 't worry about my relationship with molly woods , Just find her and the cop . Yes , sir . Of course . Sir . What part of " sidekick that doesn 't talk " Did you not understand ? You scared that woman half to death . Do you realize i could lose my license after that little stunt ? Gina : Welcome home , molly . Hi , gina . You have 987 unanswered e-mails . Would you like to sort ? Yes . No . We shouldn 't even be here , all right ? This is just a pit stop . I broke you out of the funny farm so you ... So i could help you , which is exactly what i 'm trying to do . Now , you know as well as i know That she was lying about mike being the father of that baby , So we have to figure out some other kind of way To get around this thing- - we just ... There is no " we , " all right ? It 's been a freak show Since the moment you jumped into my car- - Aliens , classified missions , accelerated pregnancies . My personal favorite ? Seeing dead people . And look at you . You 're scratching your own skin off . I-i 'm done- - i 've had enough , all right ? And clearly you need your meds . We 're gonna go back now . Oh , no , no . You told me i could come home and take a shower , And i 'm gonna go take a freaking shower . Five minutes . Ten . ( rock music blaring ) Julie : Can we please clean this place up ? It looks like a dorm room ! We have two hours to get this done ! And turn that music down ! Everybody hates me , don 't they ? Well , we 've been working around the clock . There was a near mutiny , but you staved it off with ramen . It 's just for tonight . You didn 't go promising Another dozen fully-finished humanichs over the weekend ? What was i supposed to say ? Uh , " no . " Oh ... Look . This is how mistakes get made . Mihalik , wake up . ( snorts ) Look , julie , i put a lot of tlc into lucy . I want to flip that switch as much as anyone , But we 're not ready . We can handle a smoke test . When can i play my game on the big speaker ? Not now , we 're gonna run a test soon . Charlie promised . Rabbit , i can 't do this right now- - go play your game . Come on , richard . ( richard blips and squeaks ) Everything okay at home ? He 's been so difficult . It 's hard to get anything done these past few weeks . You can hardly blame him . I mean , his father 's dead , His mother 's never coming back . Yeah , he doesn 't know that . What ? I haven 't told him That molly 's not ever coming home . I just think it 's too much for him . So i just keep saying " maybe . " Julie , you can 't string him along like that . I 'm trying to balance a lot of things here , charlie . And trying not to hurt him . He lost his parents , his friends , His family , his home- - You can 't put pinocchio back in the box Once you 've turned him into a boy . You have to deal with this . Well , maybe in an hour or so , Hopefully , we 'll have another humanich in the world , And maybe having lucy will help him move on . He 'll have a sister . He doesn 't need a sister . He doesn 't need lucy . He needs the truth , and you 'd know that If you 'd pull your head out of anna 's ass For one freaking second . I 'm sorry . That 's the msg talking . No , i 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for not being john . Sorry for not living up to your standards . But i 'm doing everything i can . For you and for ethan and for this project . So please stop second-guessing me . So is that what you 're gonna wear back to the hospital ? Nope , but i am gonna have a drink in it . Who 's the kid ? Ethan . He was my son . I didn 't know you had a son . Yeah , well ... He was a humanich . He was a what ? A robot . ( chuckles ) Oh , you 're serious ? Never a dull moment with you , is there ? Not if i can help it . Don 't make me drink alone . Just one . So tell me , is there a robot husband as well ? Uh-uh . A real one . Divorced ? Dead . I 'm sorry . You ? Divorced . But she wishes you were dead . ( chuckling ) Yeah , something like that . ( chuckles ) What are you thinking ? I am thinking that If even half of what you 're saying is true , Then it 's no wonder that ... That i ended up in crazy acres . That you ... That you need a rest . All right . Listen , i hate to be that guy , but ... Whoa . ( groans ) : Whoa ... What the , What the , what the hell did you do ? Julie : This is a glorified smoke test . We 're gonna see some basic physical functions , Simple locomotive movements and speech . I promise you , she won 't catch fire . All the more advanced processes take a little bit more time . I understand . Show me . She 's beautiful . John made her in the image of his wife . We 've ported the most recent program From her incubation server , Which means we get to see lucy experience the world In a three-dimensional , corporeal form For the first time . All we have to do is to power her up . So without further ado ... Charlie ? Yep . Charlie : Three ... Two ... One . Lucy ... This is julie . Hello , julie . You have a body now . Can you sit up ? ( chuckles ) takes a little getting used to . Anna : That 's great . I 'd love to see her stand . Uh , we weren 't prepared to make that ... Tell her to stand . Can you stand ? ( laughs ) You made it . ( laughs ) Welcome to the world . Thank you , julie . Charlie ? Hey . Uh , nice to meet you . But ... We know each other . Right , no . I-i know . It 's just seeing you ... So mature . ( explosion on game ) ( bones crackling ) aah ! Aah ! Let go ! ( grunts ) ( charlie panting ) ( beeps , clicks ) Zoe ! ( gasps ) Leave me alone Or i swear i will scream ! I 'm not here to hurt you . I 'm here to help . I know what 's happening to you . That you 're seeing things . Things that you can 't explain . Right ? Strange patterns on different parts of your body . People that have died . I know this because It happened to me , too . Please , zoe ... Talk to me . Velez : I just wanted you to know that richter fellow- - Patrol special , dishonorable discharge from second kuwait . Our trackers show they went to her apartment together . Nothing out of the ordinary . He 's due to bring her back in the next 72 hours or so . Maybe it was just a ... Conjugal visit . ( chuckles ) What 's wrong ? I got the updated assessment from taylor . I asked him what to do about the target . And ? He 's recommended a drone strike . It 's the only way to take him out . On american soil ? What about civilian casualties ? Well , he 's prepared to accept . Are you ? I can 't send another team to the slaughter . The other programs aren 't ready so ... We 're out of options . Set up a control center for the strike . Yes , sir . Shayna ? I shouldn 't have snapped at you about molly . I 'm sorry . No , don 't be . To be honest , i am not sure If it was your girlfriend asking Or your chief of staff . Either way , the answer is the same . It 's not a soft spot . It 's just history . Good . I started going back to reverie- - The vr where we met . I wasn 't looking to cheat . It seemed harmless enough , but Then i stared spending more time In my fantasy relationships Than in my real one and ... We split up for a while . Mike doesn 't know he 's not the father . Who is the father ? There were a few one-night stands . I 'm not proud of it . What 's wrong with my baby ? It 's ... It-it 's like it 's carrying a virus . And it affects the fetus . And the mother . But it happened to you and you 're alive . Yeah . But my baby was extracted from me Before it reached full term . " extracted " ? Did-did it survive ? I can 't terminate this pregnancy . I can 't . ( sniffs ) It-it brought mike and i back together . This baby won 't be healthy . You have to listen to me . ( cell phone ringing ) ( crying ) : I 'm sorry , it 's mike . I 'm sorry , i have to go . Zoe , you are gonna die ! Hey , you didn 't pay for those ! Don 't touch me ! Ma 'am ! I swear i 'll call the cops ! I said don 't touch me ! Zoe , wait ! ( screams ) ¶ ¶ ( grunts ) Hi . Are you okay ? Do you need help ? Richter : Wake up ! I said wake up ! Hey ! Wake up . We got to go . Well , what-what 's going on ? If you don 't get up right now , I will carry your ass out of here myself . Now , let 's go . How come you handcuffed me ? Because you roofied me , you lunatic ! And clearly you went on some kind Of midnight hike . Where did you go , molly ? Uh ... I went to see zoe . I told you i was gonna help her , but ... How did i get back home ? Are you really asking me that ? I don 't know . I woke up from my little nap , And here you were . ( phone ringing ) Did you take my car ? And my phone . Female electronic voice : Jd , you have two messages . Zoe : This is zoe grant calling for dr . Woods . I can 't stop thinking about what you said . I lied . I think i know who the father is , And i-i can give you a description . But , please , i need your help . I ... I don 't want to die . Julie : We doubled up teams To finish the ethical algorithms in time , Which means we skipped over the physical calibration . When she clamped down on charlie 's hand , There was no limit to the force of her grip . I take full responsibility for that oversight . I 'll turn it down for the next test . We don 't want you to turn it down . That kind of strength would be Very valuable to lucy in the field . My colleague had his hand crushed . True . But it did open our minds to new possibilities . I told you she would pass as human . And now i 'm asking you for more . We would like this new breed of humanichs to be Faster , stronger than we are . That has potential consequences ... Okay , Julie , this is the deal that you made . Now , you get to continue your work with ethan , But only as long as you deliver what we need to do ours . I understand . Speaking of ethan , It seems his behavior has become an issue . He 's been through a lot . His father just died . He 's never gonna see his mother again . I think all things considered , he seems pretty normal . Normal or not , If you cannot get him under control , We will give him to someone who can . No , i ... No , i promise you He won 't be a distraction . Good . Julie , you 're a brilliant woman . But you 've got to get your program under control . There is no more room for error . For either of us . The target escaped five months ago . Been on the run and growing ever since , Evading every attempt we 've made To capture or kill him . We thought he was dead until got up and walked out of a morgue . We 've used an accelerated aging program To create an image of what he looks like now . And this is an extraordinary threat , And it calls for extraordinary action . Which is why i 've received authorization For a drone strike . I need you to understand ... Failure is not an option . We have to eliminate the target for good . Molly : Zoe ! Zoe ! Where would she go ? Try her again . Zoe ! Straight to message . Let 's try the clinic . Maybe she went to see her doctor . What the hell did you say to her last night ? Same thing i said to her in her living room . ( cell phone chimes ) One-one-nine-six-four , passkey : Buffalojump . Val : You have an incoming alert . Fatality just reported . Victim suffered a stomach hemorrhage That has similarities to case s1-304 . Has the victim been i.D. ' d ? Sending data on file . The victim is mrs . Zoe grant . Charlie , you can 't quit ; this is good news- - they 're happy . Oh , they 're happy she crushed my hand ? ( scoffs ) congratulations on a job well done , dr . Frankenstein . I 'm sorry- - i 'm the boss , i had to make the call . The boss of what ? Have you even thought about what we 're doing here ? Yes- - this project could save lives , a lot of them . Well , i 'm sure the people Who split the atom said the same thing . Julie , humanichs was supposed to be a revolution . Six months , and all we 've done is turn it into another weapon . I didn 't sign up for this . Well , what about ethan ? Our work with him hasn 't changed . Everything has changed , including you . I can 't be part of it anymore . ( alarm sounds ) Charlie : Ethan 's core is overheating . Where is he ? Ethan ? ! Ethan ! Julie ! Ethan . What 's going on ? What are you doing ? Trying to die . Ethan , please don 't do this . Talk to me , rabbit , please . I want my mom and dad . You lied to me . You said i would see her again . I know . I 'm sorry- - i-i never meant to hurt you . We 're here for you , buddy . No , you 're not . If i mess up again , That lady 's gonna take me away from julie . I heard her say it . So that 's what she 's holding over you . And charlie said he 's leaving . So then i won 't have anyone . I 'll never see my parents again , and i 'll never see you again . And i want to cry , but i can 't , Because i 'm not human . Julie : Ethan , i 'm so sorry About your mom and dad . I am . I should have told you everything . And i ... I can 't change what 's happened . I can promise you , though , That i will never ever let anyone take you away from me . They 'll have to kill me to get near to you . I 'm dangerous , even with one arm . But you 're leaving . I 'm not going anywhere . I just said that because i was angry . We 're family , ethan . Families get angry with each other sometimes . They argue , and They say things they don 't mean . And they make mistakes . I am so , so sorry . Please , rabbit , turn your warmers down . Come on , buddy . ( julie and charlie sigh with relief ) I love you . I really , really , really , really do . Molly : We can 't just give up . I 'm not giving up , all right ? I 've got another body . Look , what i 'm gonna do is just Some good old-fashioned police work , all right ? Because if there 's a serial killer out there , Then i-i 've wasted too much time already . Are you so small-minded that you can 't consider the possibility That there is something else out there ? No , i 've considered it , all right ? But i 'm a cop , so i work with facts . I work with evidence . I believe in what i see . Oh , god . And molly ... Molly , what i see is ... Is someone who is distraught Because they 've lost their husband and their son And who needs rest desperately . No , no , but ... Molly ... But jd ... Molly . Please . Get your things . ( sighs ) Okay . No funny business . Gina , connect me to metro-mednet . Welcome to metro-mednet . I am not intended to be a substitute For professional medical advice . Okay , look , i am really sick here . Something is happening to me , and i think i 'm going crazy . What are your symptoms ? Well , i started off with severe migraines . Mood swings , unusual appetite . And now it 's getting worse . And my skin is burning , and it 's itching like crazy . And i 'm having voices in my head . And i 'm starting to black out . And i 'm ending up in places that i have no idea how i got there . When did this begin ? When i got home from space . I 'm-i 'm an astronaut . Do you think this could be , i don 't know , schizophrenia ? Or cosmic radiation poisoning ? Cosmic radiation syndrome Is a rare neurodegenerative disease brought on By prolonged exposure To high-mass , high-charged particles Found only in space . Symptoms can include those you 've described . What 's the prognosis ? The patient 's mental state may deteriorate , Resulting in aggression and confusion . In extreme cases , this can lead to paranoid delusions , Psychosis and suicide . If you 're experiencing any of these symptoms , please ... Cancel . I 'm sorry i ruined the test . There will be other tests . I don 't know why i keep doing these things . Because you 're hurting . It 's what humans do when we 've been through something sad , We do things to try and stop the pain . Well , if this is what pain feels like for humans I don 't want to feel it anymore . Ethan , what if ... What if i could take it away ? Do you trust me ? I 'm gonna wake you up in a few minutes . You 're gonna feel a lot better . ¶ ¶ Molly ? Molly ? Damn it . All right , molly woods Let 's see what you 're up to . Shepherd : We 've ran the composite Through a worldwide recognition network . Picked up a 99.9 percent hit here . A bar called hydrogen . It 's close to a heavily-populated zone . There will be civilian casualties . This is a fight we can 't afford to lose . Tell them we 're set for launch . Icarian-4 drone , We are go for launch . Feel better ? Yeah , much better . Night , rabbit . Good night , mom . Icarian-4 , inbound two minutes . Give me eyes on the target . He 's already been confirmed . Not by me he hasn 't ! If i 'm gonna drop a bomb on 52 american citizens , I want to see him with my own two eyes . Tech : Inbound 90 seconds . Tech 2 : Pulling up the bar security feed . Move left . Switch views . Tech 2 : Yes , sir . Stop ! There he is . Get me a better angle . Tech 2 : Switching cameras . Push in . Tech 2 : Sir ? Target 's in site , waiting for your go . Tech 2 : Sir ? Tech 2 : Sir . What do we do ? Launch .

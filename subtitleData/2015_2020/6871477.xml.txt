 My name is Ben Burke . Happy birthday , sweetie . [ Ben ] My father was a secret service agent in Seattle . He disappeared in a small Idaho town called Wayward Pines . My mother and I followed him there . And when we woke up , it was 2 , 000 years la fer . We 're now in the year 4032 . Man 's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations ... [ snarling ] ... known as Abbies ... [ screeching ] That rule the Earth . [ screams ] One man saw the catastrophe coming . He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind 's extinction . Some were there by choice . But , like us , most were taken against our will . - How do I get out of here ? - You don 't . [ Ben ] My father died defending his family and the people of this town from monsters outside . Dad ! [ Ben ] And threats from within . Three years after my father 's death , the town is ruled by the First Generation , those born in Wayward Pines . They rose to power and continue to rule with an iron fist . [ screaming ] It wasn 't a world I wanted to live in . So , I vowed to do something about it . Not just for me and the people of Wayward Pines , but the entire human race , those awake and those heroes who still sleep dreaming of a future for humanity as we battle to survive . I was wondering if I could borrow your bikini because you 're not using it and ... I 'm going swimming again tonight . I 'm doing it . If you don 't come with me , I 'm going with that fat guy over there in villa six , the one with the hair on his back . Two margaritas ? Uh , beer tonight . She 's , uh , resting . Sure . [ thunder rumbling ] [ Pope ] Looks like something tropical 's blowing in . Yeah . Yeah , it does . Might as well sit back and relax . Ain 't nobody getting out of here tonight . Next one 's on me . This dude stands up again , right in front of me . You knocked him out . You gotta tell me that . Man , as much money as I paid for them tickets , $ 500 , man , I 'm talking about two rows behind the bench . - If anybody 's getting thrown out ... - Right . ... it 's going to be him . Yeah . People , man . Sometimes , you wish you just ... start over , right ? Yeah . Yeah , yeah . [ Pope chuckles ] [ Pope ] No , I 'm serious , man . Change is coming . All the stuff we 're doing to this damn planet . We 're in the middle of some ... evolutionary transition . And there 's going to be a revolution as a result of it . You save people , right ? Yup . That 's my job . Salut . Now , Doc . If you had a chance to save a thousand people at once , put ' em down and then wake ' em up through some magical , like , procedure that you believed in and knew how to make it work , you would do it , right ? [ stutters ] I 'm serious , I mean , everybody might think you 're crazy . Um ... No , you knew . You are gonna save a lot of folks , Doc . Lot of people , thousands of people you ain 't never even met before . But you gonna save them . [ thunder rumbling ] I 'm glad that I met you . You know what ? I get a feeling about folks , and I got a feeling about you . [ beeps ] [ electrical whirring ] Dr. Yedlin . Uh ... Hi . [ sniffles ] Oh . [ exhales sharply ] I 'm a little ember- - Clearly , I had a little too much to drink last night . I haven 't been feeling well . [ sighs ] Hope I didn 't cause any trouble . Okay . [ Kerry chuckles ] Thank you . I 'll get back to my room . He 's awake . You 're needed at the hospital . I 'm not working , I 'm doing this vacation here with my wife , uh ... the storm- - - Where 's my wife ? - Your wife is fine . I just really need you to come with me . Now . Is seventh street clear ? [ man on radio ] Negative . Take fifth aver to Cherry Blossom . Where are we ? We 're in Wayward Pines . [ theme music playing ] [ gunfire in distance ] [ woman over P.A. ] Attentian , citizens of Wayward Pines . Due to recent rebel activity , curfew will begin in 25 minutes . [ " High Hopes " by Frank Sinatra playing on stereo ] Anyone knows an ant can 't ... Where are we going ? I told you , we 're taking you to the hospital . I 'm fine . You 're not the patient . He 's got high hopes ... The bullet 's lodged at the base of the neck . We need you to get it out . In the sky hopes ... I don 't understand . I 'm just a doctor . Just remember that ant Whoops , there goes Another rubber tree plant Whoops there goes ... [ gunfire continues in distance ] Xander . They 're heading your way . I got ' em . That ram scram He kept butting ' that dam 'Cause he had high ... [ Kerry ] Damn it . Stop the car ! [ tires screech ] High hopes He had high hopes ... [ Kerry ] No one is killing him ! In the sky hopes ... Where are you going ? Any time you 're feeling bad Stead of feeling ... It 's a small town ! Just remember that ram We 'll find you . Whoops there goes a billion ... [ pin clicks ] [ grunts ] [ explosion ] [ person whistling a tune in distance ] [ classical piano music playing ] [ whistling continues ] [ whistling stops ] [ whistling continues ] [ gunfire in distance ] [ door opens ] [ classical piano music continues ] May I help you ? Can I borrow your cellphone ? We have a land-line . For local calls . That 's good . I 've got to call the police . Who is it , honey ? He wants to borrow our cellphone . [ panting ] You want to sit down for a minute ? Hector just started playing . He 's doing some Chopin tonight . [ woman chuckles ] Isn 't music a privilege ? We 'll get you a glass of water . What 's your name ? Did you not just hear a big explosion outside ? Probably a transformer . Lines might be down . Yeah , I 'm gonna ... I 'm gonna go . Please , stay . [ panting ] Call it in . [ engine revving ] [ grunts ] [ tires screech ] [ car door closes ] [ Mario ] On your feet ! I asked you what happened at that wall . [ indistinct radio transmission ] Am I being detained ? No , but please don 't try to run again . - [ Theo ] Is this the only hospital ? - Yes . - Well , where are all the doctors ? - He died . You have one doctor in the entire town ? That 's why you 're here . [ Jason ] Dr. Yedlin . Jason Higgins . Thank you so much for coming . I 'm sorry about the whole arrival thing . I 'm sure it 's all very confusing . Yes , it is confusing . The bullet holes , the blood , your militia . I 'm very confused . This town is part of a secret government study determining the psychological effects of war trauma on civilians . He founded the project . And all of the people here are volunteers . I 'm not . We 're in an emergency tactical role-play right now . Because you come highly recommended , I told Bill Gibbons at Mass General I wanted only the best . - Bill knows that I 'm here ? - Of course . And your wife . We wanted to bring you along more traditionally , but with the storm in Hawaii ... You don 't remember any of that , do you ? [ chuckles ] Anyway , she thought it 'd be better ... well , she thought that you 'd enjoy getting right back to work . - Rebecca did ? - Of course . She 's on her way here right now . She keeps telling us this is the longest she 's ever been away from you . I know this is unorthodox , which is why it 'd be better for me to fill you in on the details later . I think the best thing would be to just put that all aside for the moment and just focus on the patient . Focus on what 's real . Can we do that , Doctor ? Right now , we can 't really wait . She 's important . Well , they 're all important , aren 't they ? Every life should be cherished . Treasured . That 's something very important to us in Wayward Pines . But she is more important than most . That is for certain . She 's septic . It 's been that way for days . Why wasn 't she treated or moved ? We have nurses and a team that are waiting . You 're the missing piece , Dr. Yedlin . [ Theo ] Get me a pot of black coffee . No sugar . We can do that . Scalpel . Yes , Doctor . [ Jason ] You 're wasting time , Doctor . [ Kerry ] So , that 's four more rebel houses cleared today ? Yes , ma 'am . How 's the surgery going ? He says it will take hours . Tell me , Kerry . We lost another one of our men tonight . Oh , hey . I bet it was Xander . Where 's he been ? - He just got back . - I don 't trust him . Two more died earlier today in the hospital . So three today . Added to the losses in the previous few weeks . Where are you , Ben ? Mario says we 're making progress . And there 's no sign of abnormal or increased activity outside the fence , according to the latest surveillance . He 'd be disappointed in me . You 're doing everything you can . [ Megan ] If they 'd gone along with you and Pilcher in the first place , it never would have come to this . [ Jason ] Every life matters here . - He taught us that . - Yes , but the cause is most important . He 'd understand how essential it is to end this rebellion and weed out the troublemakers , once and for all . Clear rules , severe punishment . - Clear- - - Clear and severe . Exactly . It 's the only way . Mario needs you . [ indistinct radio transmission ] Ben , I 'm telling you , we just have to keep picking ' em off , one by one . He 's all about the numbers , he 's going to want to bring you in and talk things through . [ sighs ] But , Xander , then nothing will change . The rallies , the propaganda , the reckonings ... we can 't escape . We need to change Wayward Pines from the inside . Yeah , well , I changed it some tonight . I mean , we at least need to have a say in how we live our lives . Otherwise , my dad and all those deaths , all for nothing . You might need to lower your standards , kid . Look , I gotta get some sleep . [ clears throat ] Some of us have to work for the enemy in the morning . Got to keep up that cover , you know . Besides , routine is the building block of happiness . That 's what Pilcher says , right ? [ all chuckle ] Dr. Yedlin . That was very impressive , what you did in there . Thank you . [ sighs ] I mean , segmental resection of saphenous vein interposition graft ? That 's right . I was just wondering , sir , if it might be possible for you to teach me that . I don 't work here . Sorry . You ... you don 't ? What , they got you , like , painting houses or something ? [ Kerry ] Dr. Yedlin . I hear it went well . She should recover . I think she should be monitored . Actually , it would be best if you did that . I 'll make arrangements . You said you 're gonna bring my wife to me ? We 'll bring her here as soon as she arrives . We have doctors ' quarters here at the hospital . I 'll have your things sent over . Let 's go talk to somebody when we get back . - [ sighs ] We 've tried that . - Somebody else . Baby , I know that we can compromise , Bec . Yeah . You 're right , about some things , we can . But how do you compromise about having a baby ? Unless there 's a middle ground I 'm not aware of . Well , you knew who I was . You knew that going in . And I loved you for it . [ automated voice ] Why not have a refreshing beverage ? [ " I Don 't Want To Set The World On Fire " by Ink Spots playing on stereo ] I don 't want to set the world On fire I just want to start A flame in your heart [ electricity crackling ] [ Arlene grunting ] In my heart I have but one desire [ woman ] You 're doing great , Arlene . And that one is you [ grunting ] No other will do Good morning . [ gasps ] She 's awake . I 'm Dr. Yedlin . I performed your surgery . " Yedlin . " I know that name . You been to Boston ? [ sighs ] [ chuckles ] Not in a while . You 're Group C. Uh ... " Group C " ? Oh , they just woke you . Bet they haven 't told you yet . About the government program ? Yes , they have . Did they tell you it was an experiment ? That we 're all volunteers ? Who briefed you ? Was it Jason Higgins ? [ Kerry ] Your room at the hotel is ready . Your wife will meet you there and we 're making arrangements for your travel home . And thank you again for everything . I know Kate thanks you as well . [ Theo ] So , where is the nearest airport ? - Boise , probably ? - Probably . And how far is Boise from here ? I don 't know . I 've never been there . - Where are you from ? - Wayward Pines , sir . So , you never want to go traveling ? Live somewhere else ? No . Funny , ' cause I 'm from a small town , too . There 's a whole world out there . I think that having a happy and productive life in Wayward Pines is the most important contribution I can make to the preservation of our species , sir . I didn 't need to save you . Still trying to figure out why you did . You 're one of their leaders . Just tell us where Ben is . Tell us where the rebels are , and this ends today . Can 't you use the chips to track them ? Or your hundreds of cameras ? Oh , yeah , that 's right . We blew up your surveillance system . Did you ever think maybe this is all just a waste ? We keep killing each other . And that 's exactly what they want . They don 't even have to come over the fence . We do it to ourselves . I 'm trying to stop that . I want to preserve life . Just like when you executed my husband in front of me . I 'm doing what Pilcher would have wanted . But things change , Jason . They evolve . And you haven 't evolved at all . You think you want to preserve life . I really believe that . But all you 've been taught is how to control it . And you can 't . [ rapid metallic scraping ] [ Danny Davis ] Mommy , don 't go . Danny , I have to go with these men for a while , okay ? - Why ? - It 's just the rules . All right ? - Mommy . - That 's enough , let 's go . Hey . That 's unnecessary . You don 't have to be rough like that . Stay out of this . Everything 's going to be fine , okay , sweetheart ? Mommy 's going to be right back , okay ? Come on , Danny , let 's go get some candy , yeah ? Let 's go . I 'll be back for you and your wife at 7 a.m. , unless the hospital needs you before then . Where were they taking that woman ? What rules were they talking about ? Someone will bring you something to eat . I 'm not hungry . You know , Theo , this whole passive-aggressive thing of yours- - I 'm not being passive-aggressive . I 'm sincerely trying to ... Look , I want your success . This is not about my work . - I am not threatened by it . - Listen to yourself . - What are you even- - - I 'm trying to fix this . And I appreciate that . You know , marriage is not a triple bypass . Yeah , I 'm aware of that . You know why ? 'Cause it 's a lot harder . This is not a problem to solve . You don 't have to try to fix everything , all the time . - I 'm built that way . - Well , I am not built that way . You just have to accept it . I don 't . Theo . [ window rattling ] It 's okay . I 'm here to help you . Come with me , I 'm getting you out of here . Here , come on . Did Kate talk to Jason ? - Who ? - Kate . Kate , the woman in the hospital . - She 's alive , right ? - Yes . Okay , did she talk to Jason , - did she say anything to Jason ? - I don 't know . Look , it 's very important , listen to me . Did she tell him anything ? Names , addresses , anything ? - I said I don 't know . - Did she say anything to you ? " Group C. " I 'm gonna go find my wife . I want to get home . [ crowd chattering ] You are home . Follow me . Time to go . You 're not gonna want to see this . [ Kerry ] Are you sure about this ? Short term pain , long term gain , remember ? They won 't love you for it . I don 't need their love . And this is on Kate . Thank you for coming . Good afternoon to all of you here on Main Street , and all of you listening throughout Wayward Pines . [ over radio ] I know there are some of you who disagree with the direction of this town over the past few years . The curfews , the rationing ... I know I 'm not the leader that Pilcher was . I 'm not the leader you want me to be . But Pilcher wouldn 't want this . This month-long rebellion helps no one . We need to work together as Pilcher intended , and figure out how to defeat our real enemies . The ones that attacked us on Invasion Day . Because , even if we disagree on some things , the survival of this town is one thing we can all agree on . Though I 'd like to announce a general amnesty for anyone who comes forward . I 'm asking you to put down your weapons . Now is the time for us to come together and make Wayward Pines whole again . [ hushed murmuring ] Anyone ? Followers of Ben and his rebellion , give yourselves up now and there will be no more need for bloodshed . [ hushed murmuring continues ] I tried . Come on , let 's go . Keep walking . [ Jason ] I 've offered you a peaceful way out . Now I have no choice . I 'm doing what Pilcher would have done . I 'm doing what 's best for Wayward Pines . Ruby . [ crowd gasps ] Hey ! [ grunting ] - I 'm a doctor . - Theo ? Rebecca ! [ Jason ] Enough . [ gun clicks ] [ Ben ] Jason ! We heard you ! You want to stop the killing , want to move forward together ? We 're here . Take them . [ soldiers chattering ] Take the doctor , too . Mason over P Al Good citizens of Wayward Pines , the rebellion is over . For your safety , suspected rebels will be detained and questioned . Your streets are safe . Work hard , be happy . Enjoy your life in Wayward Pines . Theo . Thank God you 're safe . You 're okay . Listen , Rebecca . I need you to listen to me . You have to leave right now . No , relax , it 's okay . Don 't listen to anything they say . It 's not safe . Something is rotten here . [ Mario ] Dr. Yedlin . Xander , Jason would like to speak with you , now . Let 's go . I 'll be waiting for you . Gentlemen . The rebellion is over . We need to start fresh . I was hoping you could come up to the mountain , share a meal with me , talk about the future of Wayward Pines . You need to tell me what 's happening here . Everything . I will . Just get in the car , Doctor . - You start fresh ? - It 's just a precaution . The First Generation can never harm another- - - I 'm not harming Ben . - And Theo ? You said it was an emergency . You said were putting him back to sleep . He 's skilled . - We need doctors . - We need our own doctors . Residents are almost ready . I 'm not taking any chances with him . I don 't want another Ethan Burke . I think it 's a mistake . [ Megan ] The rebellion is over , Kate . Your men have surrendered . You fought hard . All of us , so impressed . I know you believed in your cause , but it 's time for us all to move forward for the good of Wayward Pines . Why are you here ? Jason sent me . He wants to talk to you about the future . When you 're up on your feet again , of course . [ chuckles softly ] We can 't discuss the past , can we , Megan ? But the future ... that we can debate for ever and ever . I know a lot has happened . A lot of angry words . Words that hurt . And also some deaths . But we can work together , Kate . I just know it . Me too . I think it 's time to let go . [ sighs ] Oh , gosh , your pain medication 's getting low . As if you don 't have enough to worry about . I think I still remember how to do this . It 's funny how the training never really leaves you . These nurses here , I keep telling Jason that ever since they lost Pam , they 've been at sixes and sevens . [ grunting ] [ both panting ] [ groaning ] You just can 't find a way to get along , can you ? [ gasps ] We 've done so many great things . So many . Pyramids . Man on the Moon . The Beatles . We were capable of so much . But now it 's your world . Your future . And ... [ gasps ] And I don 't want any part of it . [ electrical buzzing ] [ Theo ] Where are we ? What 's on the other side of the fence ? [ grunts ] [ beeps ] [ alarm blaring ] Mario ! What are you doing ? Mario , come back ! [ grunting ] - Mario ! - Mario ! No ! Stop ! [ alarm continues blaring ] [ heavy metallic thud ] [ phone ringing ] [ several phones ringing ] [ phone ringing ] [ phone continues ringing ] [ electrical buzzing ] [ exhales ] [ growling ] [ grunting ] [ electrical crackling ] [ wild shrieking ] [ growling ] [ shrieking ] [ electrical crackling continues ] [ theme music playing ]

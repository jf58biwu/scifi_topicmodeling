This is a message from the Collective . Are you overly tired ? Or experiencing increased sensitivity . Maybe you have difficulty concentrating . You may have S.O.S. : Switched On Syndrome . BULLETIN ENDED A further 43 degrees along this Orbit ... that Holt probe will ... begin the 110 minute descent into TK-14 's atmosphere ... ATMOS ATMOS DAILY SCHEDULE AUDIO MODULE PENINSULA / MEETING 001 Bombs dropped for the Span of 28 days , and obliterated 99.6 % ... of usable arid Land on the Earth 's surface . And event that changed ... the course of human kind forever , now known as the great War . Of the two tracts of Land that survived the great War . The Peninsula still stand 44 degrees West of the Collective , and is a wild primitive area , containing empty , dilapidated buildings ... little is known of the primitive nature of the Peninsula 's inhabitants . The defects living there are ruled ... by emotion and base on desires . An ancient vestige of our past . This image shows Equips 12 leaving Earth 's . Orbit on last week 's interstellar mission . Who wrote the text for this feature ? I ... I did . Does this accurate , Nia ? Yes . Except the rocket 's fission thrusters are ... cylindrical , these appear triangular . Thank you . I will change that . Iris is back from conception duty . She got back yesterday . She had a defect . How do you know ? - She told me . - Did she have the Bug ? No . She says she is clean . Where is everyone watching ... the landing tomorrow night ? I am watching it in Bishop Park . I am going to leave to work early ... to get a good seat . If I arrive early enough , I can get a seat close to the screen . David ? David ? David ? David ! David ! You are in safe hands , now folks . Please continue on your way . EAT - SLEEP - LIVE PUZZLE ID PROGRESS Total number of puzzles solved , 2.224 . The following is an update on last night ... disturbance in living block 5-J . Health and Safety officials subdued ... two individuals engaged in coupling activities . And both have been transported ... to the defective , emotional , neuropathy facility , the D.E.N , for containment , and emotional suppression treatment . The incident is an outbreak ... of defective behavior . Remember , couplers are a danger ... to themselves , and for all of us . Physical contact , touching , or displays of emotions ... are signs of an individual infected with S.O.S. If you see the signs , report the couplers ... to Health and Safety immediately . Let us do our part to help ... contain this dangerous epidemic . With no infrastructure the Collective ... erected a patrolled border ... to contain any resurgence of Chaos . - Did anybody see that ? - Do you see what ? - That is unfortunate . - He is already dead . Did anyone recognize him ? - Not sure . - No . I do not think so . That is our first jumper in a while . His head was not match for that concrete . I just remembered there was a ... suicide in my building last night , a woman slit her throat . I hope they find someone to cover his work . Even before the demise , humankind knew ... the importance of space exploration . As the Collective , we prioritize it , and perfect it . Now , 798 million miles away , as we brace the surface of TK-14 , we move one-step further in our ... understanding of ultimate reality . Okay , everybody , this is it . 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Mark . Last but not least , speculative non-fiction , the title is inside the Peninsula . Silas , will you talk us through ... the lead illustration ? Silas ? Sorry , Leonard . I went with the scene on the Peninsula where ... the defects huddle together for warmth . In my research , I found that they ... form social bonds with each other ... to help alleviate something called anxiety . - Very good ! - Thank you . While scientists are making great strides in ... understanding this debilitating condition . A reliable cure for S.O.S. has to be found yet . And most S.O.S. sufferers will experience ... complete emotional disability . In as little as four to six months . Prior to eventual containment at the D.E.N , Kappa Rho inhibitors offer a reliable ... means of dampening symptoms , and slowing the stages of the disease . Allowing sufferers to maintain ... What stage ? - Excuse me ? - What stage are you ? I am just here for a checkup . Strictly precautionary . I am Jonas . Silas . What stage are you ? Two . You look healthy . Well ! I have my good days and my bad days . - Silas ? - Good luck ! Thank you . The ground was rushing towards me . I could not breathe . I felt like my stomach was ... it was in my mouth . It was extremely unpleasant . You had a nightmare , Silas . I never want to experience ... anything like it again . How long have you had these symptoms ? Maybe three days , no longer than that . I am going to take some blood , now . Can you give me your hand please , Silas ? Your test is positive , Silas . You are on stage one . A woman in my office recently ... gave birth to a defect , I ... I could not have caught it from her . Not if she is clean , right ? Even if this woman has S.O.S. It is not contagious . I would like to start you on a full ... course of inhibitors immediately . There is no reason , why you should not be able ... to live a normal life . At least for a while . In addition , the D.E.N. You must not think about that for now . The D.E.N. is a long way off for you . The Cure is right around the corner . STAGE 1 NAME : SILAS 618429877 OCCUPATION : ILLUSTRATOR Where were you , Silas ? I went to the cafeteria to drink some tea . Is that where you got the bruise ? No . Last night in Tai Chi class . The man next to me accidentally struck me . Silas , you were not in Tai Chi class , last night . Yes , he was . I saw him . What is that ? It is a Bumble Bee . Careful . Do not they have sting ? According to the laws of aerodynamics . They should not even fly . However , they do not know it . Therefore , they fly anyway . Part of the solution is taking your inhibitors . Your health is the health ... Picking up . STAGE 1 If you are watching this film , your Doctor has diagnosed you with S.O.S. Switched On Syndrome . As members of the Collective . We hear a lot about Switched On Syndrome . Here is important information about how ... this debilitating disease will affect you . And how you can manage it responsibly , before eventual containment ... at the defective emotional ... neuropathy facility , the D.E.N. Switched On Syndrome is a malfunction ... of the gene silencing . That controls human emotions , and eliminates human flaws . But in Switched On Syndrome , problem genes ... lose their silencing and re-awaken . Leading to unpredictable sensory experiences , and behavioral defects . Until a Cure is available . Inhibitors are the only effective means ... of slowing the disease is staging , while dampening the onset of emotion . And while the causes are unknown , we do understand the disease 's progression . During stage one , intermittent feeling , you will experience difficulty concentrating , depression , pain , overwhelmed feelings , impulsivity , and sensitivity to light . As the disease progresses into further stages , consistent low level emotion , and emotional volatility , these symptoms will worsen . In stage four , acute behavioral chaos , you will no longer function , as a productive member of the Collective . And your Doctor will prescribe ... containment at the D.E.N. Where you will be provided ... with electron restraint , emotional suppression , and a pain-free death scenario . If you have questions about your condition , notify your Doctor or Health , and Safety official for immediate attention . And remember , a Cure is right around the corner . Hello , Silas . Hello , Nia . 6 L Individuals no longer . I read your article on the Harlow 9 probe . I was wondering , if you could look over my impressions . However , you are speculative non-fiction . I switched with Leonard . Why ? I felt like a change . There is a staff meeting tomorrow afternoon . Why do not I review your work then ? I would really appreciate your ... input at this early stage , if it is not too much trouble . NETWORK - SILAS ILLUSTRATOR - NOTES MEETINGS PENINSULA SERIES CONCEPT BRIEF This is not what I described . Is not it ? Harlow Nine is a lander not an orbiter . Moreover , where is it a robotic arm ? Are those for a feature ? Yes . I thought you were speculative non-fiction . I switched with Leonard . One more thing . The Leo landing was made on a flat surface . The way you drawn it . It looks almost mountainous . Is there anything else ? I can help you with , Silas . Thank you for your feedback . You 're welcome ! HARLOW 9 - EXPLORATION It is this vastness . Inaccessibility , symmetry ... and the permanence of the night sky ... that made it a natural topic ... the for philosophers pursuing ... understanding of ultimate reality . It is this vastness ... inaccessibility , symmetry ... and permanence of the night sky ... that made it a natural topic for philosophers . Understanding of ultimate reality . It is this vastness ... Atoms our past is not a relic . We should leave behind . Nevertheless , a living creation is ... something to be handled . The work we do at Atoms is ... which links our present . I am so sorry . You dropped these . Thank you . It is about time you all knew . I had test positive for S.O.S. I am stage one . I am taking inhibitors . There is no evidence the Bug is contagious . However ... if it makes you feel more comfortable , I will wear a facemask from now . Silas , I am very sorry . How long do you have ? It is difficult to say . Is this why you stopped ... to do speculative non-fiction ? I do not know , Rachel . Possibly . A facemask is a little extreme . Although I do not think ... he should sit with us anymore . In addition , you should have your own mug . Do you all agree ? Yes . We cured cancer . We cured the common cold . We can cure S.O.S. You are going to live , pal . - Yes . - Of course ! Thank you all . SILAS This has to stop . If it continues , I will be forced to report you . Do you understand ? You have a Bug . Do not have you ? I am clean . The day that man jumped off the building ... You saw his body out the window , you ... You seemed ... affected . There have been other times , too . I have been watching you . The way you look at the world ... the way you experience things . I am clean . It is different . What you are going through ... it must be very difficult . If you are , clean ... this conversation would not ... even be taking place . You would have reported me , already . Am I right ? Good night , Silas . - Good morning , Silas . - Good morning , Nia . Finally , the Harlow landing . Nia , do you have any more notes for me ? No . Your changes work well . Thank you . Onto the next , article then , Zoe ... These are my impressions of the Harlow ... flow anomaly on the planet BL 4 . The visible bio shock ... - Good night , Nia . - Good night , Rachel . Your bruise went away . Did you notice that ? I have the Bug , one year and three months . I did not want to go to the Doctor . I just rather knew . You know there is really nothing ... any ... anyone could do to help . Moreover , I am scared of the meds and then ... It does not seem fair at first . Right ? You know , I could live ... I could live with it . However , every day was different , and that was the hardest part . Every single time I thought I knew something , or learned anything , I ... I did not . I felt this guilt every time , I wanted to go back to normal ... like I would not want that . Every day , I am practicing .. Unbearable discipline , and self-control . Do you realize ? What would happen ? If anyone saw us in here right now ! We would go straight to the D.E.N. It is a death sentence . One of my neighbors missed , two Doctor 's appointments . I have not seen him in six weeks . We cannot do this again . It cannot happen , you know that . We just ... We just have to hold out for the Cure . Will you stay in here with me a little longer ? - Are you okay ? - Yeah . I need to go . Nia , are you staying late again , tonight ? I am not sure . I wish I had your kind of work ethic . I received a message from Zoe . On her way to work this morning , she received a conception duty summons . Could one of the illustrators ... to present for her in the staff meeting ? I will do it . I will be glad too . - Good night , Nia . - Good night , Kate . They may simply label as dualist . Two subject concepts , and one materialist subject concept . The way , you have been looking at me ... I cannot help it . I can feel it . What does it feel like ? It feels just wrong . No , no . No . It is not wrong . It is completely right . This feeling is ... completely right . I am scared . I am so scared . I am too . I am too ! Hello , Leonard . Silas . I did not expect to see you here , this late . Have you thought about killing yourself ? No , that is not until stage three . Why is Nia 's interface on ? Have you been snooping again , Silas ? Excuse me ? A month ago , Health and Safety saw you ... on Nia 's interface after-hours . I told to keep an eye on you . Is there something you want to tell me ? As the manager here at Atoms , one of my duties is to maintain the safety , and welfare of the team . Therefore , if I believe ... that someone on the team is in danger , or involved in an activity that is unsafe , I would report him , or her , to Health and Safety . Unless , of course , that activity stopped , Does that make sense for you ? Yes . Good . Shall we get out of here , Silas ? - Good night . - Good night , Nia . He knows . What are we going to do ? We have to stay away from each other . I cannot ... stay away from you . I cannot ... not be around you . Not in that office . Not when I see you every day . It is impossible . I thought about it . The best thing for me is to leave Atmos . Get a job somewhere else . It is as you said ... we have to hold on for the Cure . That is all we should be thinking about it . Nia ? Have you received a conception duty summons ? Let us work together to populate the Collective . Insemination is quick , and solitary , during gestation you will be supporting , and growing the Collective . If you received a summons , please ... Are you sure ? This is what you want ? I am sure . Positions at Atoms are highly coveted . Once those we placed you ... I understand . Because of my diagnosis . I think a work environment , where I interact less with ... others would be better . For everyone is benefit . That is a very responsible attitude . I will introduce you . Nia meet Dominic , our new illustrator . Dominic , this is Nia , she works in text . You will be interpreting her words . It is very nice to meet you , Nia . Welcome to Atmos . Follow me . SILAS I also design rockets . I could have been an engineer , but I lacked patience . I think working at Atoms is ... a vitally important job . Science is a process , and often leads to dead-ends . However , here ... we are delivering the answers , we are educating people . Knowledge is sacred , and Atoms are the new scripture . If you think about it . We are kind of like preachers . Where did you study ? I am self-taught . I always drawn pictures ever since , I was a child . One of my guardians , Barnabas , nicknamed me the Little Da Vinci . Did you hear ? Zoe was inseminated . It means she is clean . She did not catch the Bug from Silas . That means we are probably clean , too . I am definitely clean . I donated blood last week . SILAS Silas ? Jonas . Are you okay ? Okay . Do you want to take a walk ? I miss her . I do not know . I felt so good to be around her that ... We were nearly tripping up and I could not see ... I could not see anything bad happening to her . You two were in love with each other . That is very clear . You were right to end it , though ... I think dealing with this disease , on your own is hard enough , the coupling would just make it unbearable . You know ... about a year ago ... I also made a connection with a woman . However , it did not end well . So sorry . Your friend ... In what stage is she ? She was self-diagnosed . She is fighting the Bug without drugs . She is a hider . Not many people can do that successfully . I think hiders are ... I think they are wired differently . You know , we have one in our group , Bess . She has a ... She has a Doctor at the D.E.N , of all places . Listen ! I am part of a group . A support group ... with Bess and others from my work . We talk openly about how we feel . If you are interested , I will be vouch for you . It might help . I would be willing to try . Great ! Nia , it is I again , until you give me , some text to work , I am idle , and that does not seem like ... a very good use of my time . I am almost finished , Dominic . All the other illustrators received ... their pieces hours ago ... I am almost finished , Dominic . However , I appreciate your patience . Of course ! Silas , you made it . This is great . I am glad you are here . Everybody , this is Silas . The one I was telling you about . Silas , this is Bess , Peter and Thomas . Gilead , Max , and Alice . Come take a seat . Then after lunch , he just kept staring at me , as if he could tell I was not taking my meds . In addition , I wanted to say something to him . Then I thought , what if I am just imagining it ? Therefore , I turned , and walked away . Moreover , all I could think is that he knows . He is going to report me , and I am going be caught . Moreover , I cannot stop thinking that . All the time ... It is natural . It happened to every one of us . Yes , but all I could think is , that I am going to the D.E.N. I am going to the D.E.N. It is over . In addition , they are ... What happens in the D.E.N ? Half the people who are brought in from there ... commit suicide . The staff encourages it , and stands by while it happens . That is the preferable option anyway . Compared to electron restraint , and all the other methods of treatment . Nevertheless , there is value in living . Being a hider reminds you that . I still do not know how you do it . Working for Health , and Safety is hard enough . Yes , it is difficult to see things , and not be moved . However , that is what being a hider is all about . Therefore , you do small things to help . Just looking someone in the eyes . It can make them feel they are not alone . Give them hope . But under no circumstances you interfere . You have to tell yourself , do not risk your job , and do not risk your life . However , why stay in a position . Where do you feel so much risk ? You could ask reassigned . I would rather be with people who feel . Who feel intensely ! It reminds me who I am , and why I choose to keep on living . Everybody says it is not contagious . After all these years as awful as it is . Every day I feel stronger ... affinity with other people . See , I do not believe in all the research . Feelings engender feelings . S.O.S. is not even a disease . That is what they say . Switched off is something ... They do to us between conception and birth . S.O.S. is who we really are and ... the inhibitors are just another ... attempt to squash that . I do not know . It is so hard . It is lonely . At least with the inhibitors , I can get , but now ... I would rather feel nothing . Nothing is better than this . Hey . It is okay . It is okay . It is okay ! I could never have imagined what love felt like . It is strange . As a little tornado going around . Yeah . That is why I was so scared of it at first . It is about giving , I want you to take everything , I do not even know what it is . I just want you to take it from me . I just want . I want to run . I want to run ... both of us ... as fast as we can , outside just take off . It is so weird , I am ... I keep on thinking about it . Ever since we were kids . It has been drilled into us . Our purpose is to explore the universe , you know . Space is somewhere that we will find ... the answers to why we are here , and ... Where we come from . It is as if everyone is ... searching for these answers . 800 million miles away , and the truth is ... The answers are right in front of us . I know why I am here . I am too . What are we going to do now ? We just spend so much time , here together as we can . I go to work act normal , then ... at night ... We are together . Okay . What you looked when you were little ? Have you always had these freckles ? I do not know . I think so . - Did you grow up early ? - Did I grow up early ? Yeah , I was tall , until I was not . I was a little round kid . What was your favorite subject ? I liked History . How about you ? I always really loved to write . What did you write ? When you were a kid . I always liked to write Poetry . I do not know , I go the school trips is all . When we had to go ... to the great War museum ... to see how the bombs dropped , and wiped out the cities and stuff . I see a future outside of this room . Some place out there . In the vastness of everything we know . In all those millions of miles . Dominic BI , the article is finished . You gave it to me , already . I am working on it right now . No , the one after this . On the extraction of super fluids , from Neutron Stars . No pressure . I wish I could explain this to everyone else . I am sick of being ... I scared of being caught . I want the people know , moreover , I do not think we are sick . PLEASE SEE YOUR DOCTOR TODAY The significant breakthrough came ... with the isolation of the bulbar cell line . Allowing an effective genetic re-silencing , without triggering ... the systematic organ malfunction . That had marked earlier attempts . To be clear . This is not another Kappa Rho inhibitor . It is a Cure that restores the health , and systematic order to the individual . With the Ashby ENI Cure , it is only a matter of time , before all current S.O.S. cases treated , and future cases prevented . The ENI Cure is injected directly into the neck . Leaving a small coin-like scar , a quick and simple procedure . Once administered the drug requires ... a six hour absorption period , before the disease is completely neutralized . After this point , regardless of stage , the patient is restored to the normal health . Mass production of the drug is already underway . And shipments are being made available to public clinics immediately . Individuals diagnosed with S.O.S ... do not need to suffer another day . Contact your Doctor immediately . To receive the Ashby ENI Cure , and rejoin the ranks of Equals . We will go to remember this feeling . We are going to live every day . To remember as I feeling . We will not even exist anymore . No . It is not over . We are not doing that . Do not you want the Cure ? No . Do you ? No . Take this Robert . This is Nia . We want to go to the Peninsula . At my old post , I took part in an air patrol . We would not fly directly ... over the Peninsula , but ... I could see it from a distance . It is totally overgrown . If anyone actually lives there . It is in a completely primitive state . How do we get there ? Are you seriously considering this ? We have already decided . You know , you will be on your own out there . There will be no one to look after you . Whatever we go through , we will be together . I know how you are feeling , however , you are not thinking in all the risks . If we stay here , we will find out . We will get the Cure . You know , it was many years ago . I was not much older than you are now . When I got the Bug . No one even knew what S.O.S. was back then . People that get it , and most of them committed suicide . There was a young man in my living block . I could tell he was a hider , just like me . However , no one dared mention it back then . One night ... He knocked on my door , and told me that he , and two others ... were going to the Peninsula , moreover , he wanted me to go with him . Of course ! There was no way was I going . I knew they headed for their deaths . Bess . A few months after he left were the loneliest , I ever felt . We had only spoken one time . More than all the suicides I have seen . It was his death , this was the most ... unnecessarily wasteful . Such a waste . That was a new feeling for me . However , you do not know if he died . What if he did not ? I can talk to my old colleague . He was the pilot who took us on the air patrol . If they caught , the whole plan could be traced back to you , alternatively , to the group . You said that interfering was too risky . If you make this decision , you know ... There is no turning back . If you do manage to get out . You can never return . Of course ! When you get to the border , ask for Oliver , he will fly you . What if he gets caught ? He will not . Good luck ! Thank you . Welling is the closest station to the border . Trains do not go there until the weekend . I checked the schedule . We can leave on Saturday . Three days . - You are shaking . - You are . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Are you ? Yes . I got a conception summons . However , we are leaving in two days . By the time , that they came looking for you . We would go , ignore it . My tag is blocked . I am not going to get on the train . I will not make it through ... any of the checkpoints . Look ! It is just a summons , right ? It is not as if . They are going to inseminate you . They will check my blood . They will see I have the disease instantly . Yeah , but ... They cannot force you to get the Cure . I have been diagnosed . No one is forcing me to get it , are they ? Besides , the clinics are overwhelmed , right now . All that is going to happen . They will tell you have test positive for S.O.S. Moreover , you should see ... your Doctor immediately that is it . Then , get out of there . Nothing changed . We are leaving Saturday , 10 o 'clock on train . You have missed the entire morning of work . You should get over there right away . I will come after my shift . Meet me behind the clinic . Okay . I received a summons . - Hello , Nia . - Hello , Doctor . Lie back for me , please . I am going to take a sample of your blood , okay ? Okay . I have the Bug , do not I ? Nia , you are pregnant . - What is it ? - She is pregnant . She was called for conception duty , in addition , they found out . They took her to the D.E.N. You need to calm down . I am calm , I am calm , and it is fine . When did they take her ? I do not know , about an hour ago or something . Well , listen ! I will contact Bess ... No , no . No . Not Bess . She will not help us . Ask someone else . There is no one else . Bess is our only hope . Listen ! You cannot be seen around here like this . I am fine , but let me come with you . Let me help her . Go home . I will contact you . Wait there . I can talk to them . Let me go with you . You do not attempt to see Nia . Silas go home , trust me . What are they going to do her ? Just calm down ! You need to stay calm . Alternatively , they will give you the Cure . Give me a couple hours . Go home and wait there . TERMINATE PREGNANCY RESTRAINTS ENABLED DELIVER CURE PREGNANCY TERMINATION CANCELLED Jonas ? You get dressed as fast as you can . In addition , listen to me carefully . Last week , a woman called Eva was brought in . She was in stage three . Last night , she was knotted ... a garbage bag over her head , suffocated , she is dead . Now you ... are going to switch places with her . Eva did not kill herself last night , you did . You are Eva , she was you . You are going to walk out of here . Just ... Hold out your arm . Your left arm , please . Okay . All right . You are Eva . - You got it . - Ready ? I told Silas to wait at his apartment . You will find him there . NAME : EVA OCCUPATION : DATA MGR Eighteen .

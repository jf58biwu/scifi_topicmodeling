About my dad , we used to go and find objects together . - Some really , really old . - I am gonna get in trouble , Billy . Almost like that show American Pickers .

Look , if we find something cool , then you can keep the half . It 's a rule that ... They are gonna blow this whole thing . It will all be gone in a week now . Billy , can I be honest ? The deal was I drop you somewhere I get the van for few hours okay ? This is weird . Like we don 't know each other at all . I don 't know what we are doing here , and you seem ... Wait . I gotta tell you something . I 'm on the spectrum . Is that like a workout program ? Like , Tae Bo ? No . It 's a diagnosis Excuse me . I know ! It was a joke . I was kidding . See that 's the thing , I did not get the joke . Like my brain doesn 't work the same as yours does . Yeah , well , consider that a good thing . It 's just that I can 't read humor or sarcasm . But I do remember things . I remember everything . - Billy , let me stop here . - Okay . You do not need to tell me all of this . We are cool . Ok , we are ... We are almost there .

I came with Billy . Billy Cranston ? Weird . But I 've seen him up here before . My house is on the other side of the mountain . I hike these trails sometimes to clear my head . And I stare down at Angel Grove and wonder how such a small crap town ... can cause me such misery . That funny to you ? No , I just .. I feel the same way . Yeah . Jason Scott , the star quarterback crashes and burns . Destroys his career and destroys our season . Go , Tigers ! Now walking around town , and everyone 's looking me like I ran over their dogs . So why don 't you leave ? You know . Just go , I can leave here , you know ? Where ? God , anywhere . So let 's go . - What ? - You would never do it . - Try me . - Oh , You and me ? You got a car ? - I have a van . - Oh , that 's creepy . - It 's not that kind of van . - Every van 's that kind of van . So let 's go . Are you daring me ? ' cause I 'll go . Good .

There 's something down there , follow me . - Where we are ? - I don 't know . Jason ! I 'm sliding . Hi . Again ? Well , that is unusual . It just gets better and better . Do you feel that ? Something out here . The walls are shaking . Come on . That is impossible . This must have been here for millions of years . Look how the rocks is growing around it . I do not like this place . Hey , guys . Check it out . - It 's okay . - It 's okay . Okay . - Holy ... - Shhh ! - Think there 's aliens in here ? - Just be quiet , Zack . It 's so cold in here . Jason , is this real ?

Wait , where is the other guy ? One , two , three , four ... Ah , there he is . No no no . All of you . In a spaceship buried underground ? How long have you been waiting ? - What 's the day ? Monday ? - Yeah . Then , 65 million years . I 've been very lonely . You all so young looking . - This has to do with the coins ? - Yes , the coins ! Different colors , different kids . Different color kids ! No one said you 're here ! Turn around . Go on . No way . Proceed . I think this will work . One Two Three Four Five . Different colors . Guys , focus on getting out of here . Stay together and when we see a chance , we run like hell . Okay . And if we don 't get a chance ? Then we kill it . Shouldn 't hurt , but let 's see . Please step into the footprints . - No , we will not . - Hey , Question . What are you ? I am Alpha 5 , persona Android . What ? - He said he 's an Alpha 5 ... - Yes , I know . I 'm a talking robot . You can trust me . Billy ! What the hell . Okay . Why they look at each other ? Is a human characteristic ? Fascinating . It works ! This is great ! It 's working ! Zordon ! Are you there , Zordon ? Alpha ! Where we are ? I 'm glad to hear your voice , Zordon ! I can see you , Alpha but I can 't see me . Where am I ? You 're inside the ship . Okay . Okay . Sir , I sealed your essence into the ship 's matrix . C 'mon . Let 's go ! Move on ! But the ship is on ? The power coins have finally returned to the ship . Go , go , go . Where are the coins ? Where are the rangers ? Come forward , please . Do we have a choice ? I do not think so . They speak a primitive dialect called English . You 'll find it in the ship 's matrix . Look ! It 's Zordon ! What ? Zordon , they don 't know who you were . Come in , come in . These are them ? They are so small . Funny , I said the same thing . You mean to tell me that the fate of the universe , placed in the hands of these children ? The universe ? That 's a big place . They 're teenagers . Somewhere between infancy and full maturity . It 's hard to explain really . Show me the coins . The Morphing Grid is never wrong . If the power coins have returned to the ship with these ... Teenagers ! With these teenagers ... then these teenagers are the Power Rangers . Power Rangers ! What ? Okay , a quick question . Hello . Hate to interrupt . Did I just hear you say we 're Power Rangers ? Yes . Yes . You are the Power Rangers . Any other questions ? - No . I think I 'm good . - Good . I have a question . Hi . How you doing ? My name is Billy . Billy Cranston . Kids used to called me Billy Cramps ... Billy ! Stop . Sorry . The images here in this sphere tell the history of the Power Rangers . Looks like the Power Rangers were a team that protected life ? And life is a bright light . Or a piece of light ? Yes . Yes , Very good Billy . It is called the Zeo Crystal . Oh . I love this part . This is good . And every planet in the universe that has life . Has a piece of the Crystal buried inside it . 65 million years ago , Zordon 's team died ... defending the Crystal here and what is now Angel Grove . The Coins have chose you five . Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal and life on Earth . Because we are the Power Rangers ? He 's smart ! I 'm sorry , is this some kind of a joke ? Like I 'm standing here , with a wet wedgies . My socks are so squiggling around , We 're talking to a wall . I mean guys ... Silence ! Sir , I am detecting elevated heart rate . They are very scared . I don 't understand . Why would you show us that nightmare ? It 's not a nightmare . - It 's the future . - Is that for real ? - Felt like it . - Who was that woman ? Her name is Rita Repulsa . She will create Goldar , a huge monster who will rip the crystal from the earth ... and all life on your planet will die . With the Crystal , Rita will have the power to create and destroy worlds . So let me guess . You want us to kill this woman , Rita ? - Aye , aye , Rita . - She must be stopped . - When is she coming ? - It 's already here . My best guess is that we have 11 months . I am sorry . Days . Eleven days . If we are the Power Rangers and this is our ship ... If I walk through that door right now will it open for me ? Yes of course . Come on . Wait , what are you doing ? No , no , no , come back ! - No. please don 't . - Jason ! My ranger team died defending the Crystal from Rita . That 's why I 'm in this wall . How do you know my name ? Because it 's you , Jason Scott . You are the leader . You 're the Red Ranger . Rita was a Ranger too , and my friend . But she betrayed us . Wanted more power . She lost her way . Now she is just pure evil . You must bring them back all of the Rangers . You must train your team to stop Rita ... before she has the strength to find the crystal . Okay , I 'm leaving . And I speak only for myself ... No ! You speak for all of them . You know that deep down what I am saying is true . You were born for this . Who exactly are you ? Really ? Now you gonna ask me who I am ? - Look , her name is Didi . - Trini . She 's new at school transferred in a month ago . We have English together , right ? I have been in Angel Grove , for over a year now we have Biology together . - Good talk . - Wait , look . None of us really know each other , okay ? Bu somehow , we were all in the same place ... at the same time when Billy found those coins . And . No , Wait wait . Can I ask a question ? Are we really superheroes ? We 're More like Iron Man or Spider-Man ? Cause I feel like I 've been bit by a spider , but I feel really good ... - I just feel good . - Look bro , trust me . You 're not a superhero . Why are you talking like to us like you 're the boss ? Hey , hold up . Can any of this Rita stuff be real ? - Can any of it be true ? - I don 't know . But I know that the answer to what 's wrong with us ... and what 's happening to us , is here . So ... What are you saying ? I think we gotta come back . I can 't make you come back here , but 4'o clock tomorrow I will be here . Hey , Jason . We don 't ... Of course ! I do not know , I didn 't think about that one in the first place . So .. Where were you today ? Were you with friends ? Do you have any friends ? - Why are you do tired ? - You did ask her four questions ... before she 's even answered the first . Because she 's like a ghost around here . She needs to start communicating . - June . - Say something . - Speak ! I just ... - Relax . Okay , relax . Okay , Trini , let 's start over . Please tell us one thing you did today . Me and four kids from Angel Grove found a spaceship buried underground . What ? I 'm pretty sure I 'm a superhero . Cool ! Not cool . Pee in that cup ! It 's to remind me of my screw up ? No . Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it . You know the frame 's straight and the engine still runs . It 's a terrible situation . You gotta come with me . A series of grisly crimes scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet of Angel Grove reeling bodies were discovered on a fishing boat . This raft of violence .. What the hell are you doing ? I need gold , I build my beautiful Goldar . Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal I take the universe . They do ! So Crazy girl . Hey . Shall we do this ? You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger . You must never use your powers for personal gain . You must never escalate a fight . Unless your enemy forces you to . And you must never reveal your identity. ever . To assume your ranger identities you need to morph . Have any of you morphed before ? Yes , but only in the shower . Okay , okay , let 's step into the footprints , please . Let 's try this . Standing in this circle as a team , You can easily connect to the morphing ' grid . Do you feel it ? Yeah they do . No , not feeling it . You need to morph to get your armor . I knew it ! We do get armor . Jason ! We get armor ! Cool ! When you give us the armor ? You already have it inside of you . You bring it out by connecting to each other . And connecting to the Morphing grid . Bury your minds and focus . Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life . Yes ! They must become those warriors . Become the warriors ! What ? What ? Did It worked ? Alpha 5 , why they didn 't they morph ? I do not know , sir . It is disturbing . Very disturbing . Might take some time . We don 't have time ! If they can 't morph , what are we supposed to do ? They will have to train without armor , they need to prepare . Without armor ? Sir that will be very painful , Take them down to the pit . Alright , follow me . We are going to the pit ! Jason I don 't want to find out what the pit is . So , This is the pit . It 's nice , right ? Alpha 5 , begin the exercise . Sorry , guys . - What exercise ? - Chill out dude . These creatures before you are simulations of Rita 's army . They are called ... to get to her . No , no , no , Jason . Relax , guys . It 's a hologram . Like video games . Look . Strong ass hologram . Not a video game . This is why you must morph into your armor . If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army ... The real beginning of the end . Rangers Welcome to training . I 'm so excited you guys are back . Aim for the center .. Once more time . Dodging their punches . Find their weak site . Let 's go a couple of hits . Okay ? No let 's try that again . This is exciting . Yeah , Trini ! Ready , master Billy ? You need to learn the element of surprise . - Ready ? Let 's go again . - Okay . Billy , light on your feet . Hands up . Play with some energy now ! let 's go ! Focus ! focus everybody just focus ! Lucky shot . You guys all know you can be murdered , right ? No . You must shade your own mask to wear this armor . I don 't feel anything ! No . Take them down to the pit . Watch me . Slip , grab , lift ! Yeah ! Slip , grab , lift ! Yes ! We SHOULD start a band Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you . It 's working ? - No , it 's not . - Come on ! Try harder ! I have been concentrated though . All we need to do is just concentrate ... - Don 't tell me to concentrate . - Just follow my lead . - Let 's not fight with each other . - Now is not the time . Come on . Let 's go to train . The information we need to triangulate the location of ... The Crystal was lost in the battle . Billy Are you listening to me ? Billy What are you doing ? Billy ! Where is the crystal Find him , Billy , find him . Where is the crystal ? There . 17 degrees north ... Hey , idiot , watch where you 're going . Krispy Kreme DOUGHNUTS Two fishermen were led to rest today at St Andrews cemetery . Residents of Angel Grove are feeling the shock . Fear has the town on edge . The series of murders has police baffled ... as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene . What is now being Angel Grove 's gold killer is still on the loose / . If Rita manages to create Goldar ... Are you listening to me ? And he rips the crystal from the ground .. .. It will be like ten thousand nuclear bombs washing over earth . That supposed to freak us out ? We keep making this harder . We are busting our asses , Feel free to throw us a bone at some point . Yes , I see you busting your asses . So I 've decided to give you some inspiration . What you will find beyond this wall will forever change your life . Come on . - The Zords ! Pretty cool , right ? - Yeah . They take on the form of most powerful organism on the planet . When these Zords formed , dinosaurs reigned supreme . They will be an extension of you . And there power is all but limitless . They are incredible . But you are not ready for this power . When you morph , your armor will make you one with the zords . Come on . Let 's go train . Today is the day you become Rangers ! I can feel it ! Okay . Let 's go . Yeah . Let 's go . This was a bad idea . Okay , okay . Signals , brakes . Brakes , I need the brakes ! Manual . Manual . Where are the breaks . Alpha 5 ? Oh , God hey , Move ! Move ! Out of the way ! Oh , Tailing on the mountain . After you remember that today 's train lesson the important thing is to ... Wait . Where is Zack ? Seriously ? Run , run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! It 's bad ! You 're alright ? Alright , my bad , my bad . That 's on me right there . What 's your problem ? You could 've killed yourself , or us . - Back off , boss . - Hey ! No , Come on guys . Wow . - Guys , guys , come on . - Watch it . Wait . What are you doing ? Stop fighting , please ! What ? Stand still . What ? I got something on my face ... ? Yeah ! - Ok , now that 's cool ! - Oh , Yeah ! Don 't touch it . Zack , don 't touch it . Zack , do not touch . Where 'd it go ? Bring it back , bring it back , dude . Get out . The training is over for today . Go home . I 'm sorry , he just morphed . He did it . You saw it , right ? Do it again . All of you . - Billy , how 'd you do that ? - Come on , Billy , let 's do it . Come on , do it again . - Do it again . - I 'm trying . I can 't focus Billy , how 'd you do it ? Show us . Okay , we don 't know how . That 's what I thought . If you can 't morph , You are not Rangers . Go home , all of you . Now what ? - Got damn ! - Seriously ? Hey , guys . Guys . Look , I 'mma stay up here tonight . Make a fire , I got some food . If you guys wanna stay I 'm down . Alright . Cool . Jason 's failing experiment . I shall destroy Rita myself . There must be a way to free me from this wall . Yes , but the irony is that you need these rangers to morph . If they morph , you can harness that energy ... to regenerate your body and come back through . No , there 's got to another way ! I can 't ... What , Zordon ? You can 't what ? Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life . That 's what all this has been about , right ? You coming back ? This has only ever been about to protecting the crystal Rita could be building Goldar as we speak . Don 't underestimate me or my team . You can 't stop him .. She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth .. will die . And we need you . Because you were so successful in stopping her last time . I died burying those coins ... In hopes they will find next real Rangers . Those who are worthy . I 'm sorry to disappoint you ! I don 't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong . I can go home and get that . Jason ! You need me out of this wall . To help lead this team ! Your team is dead . And you 're just as scared as we are . These are off 24 carat Gold . I 'll be right with you . You 're so sweet . I 'll be right back . Can I help you ? Gold . I 'm interested ... gold . Yeah . We have some very nice pieces here . Come closer . Closer , closer . Closer . This . Give it to me ! Okay . There you go . Grow . Grow . Police ! Don 't move ! Drop it , weapon , put your hands on your head . Do it Now ! Do it , I say , lady ! Lady ? I like the sound of lady . Get on the ground and you won 't get hurt . Unit 5 , I need backup at Jewelers Phoenix . Shots were fired . I repeat , shots were fired . Down ! It 's been too long since I raised my beautiful creatures . Did you miss me ? Oh my God . Kill him . - Alright . - Ha-ha . " How we are stuck in this wall I will make that jump . " What happened back there ? Nothing , don 't worry about it . Billy , how 'd you do it ? How 'd you morph ? I don 't know . What do you guys saying him about one more trying to morph ? " You must shade your masks to wear this armor . " " Think only of each other and the morphing ' grid will open to you " . Yeah , that 's better . Or maybe it 's Cause we don 't know each other . Maybe that 's why we can 't morph . Okay . No , I am serious , let 's do this for real I am Jack and I am a Power Ranger . - Hi , Zack . - Hi , Zack . True I live in the Melody mobile home park . It 's just me and my mum . And my mom ? My mom is the best ! But my Mom. she 's sick . I do what I can ... but I 'm scared . Sometimes I get too scared to stay the night because I 'm afraid she can 't make it . And if she goes ... When she goes ... I got nobody else . Look . I think being with you guys is good for me . Let 's do that . Let 's tell our secrets it will help us . Okay , I got a secret . - I like country music . - What ? As a matter of fact , I love country music . And I don 't ... I don 't miss my dad that much I mean coming to the mine with him was all I had . But .. coming to the mine with you guys is just as good . Yeah . Biggest secret is why 're you in detention . - I blew up my lunch box . - What ? But it was an accident . - What ? - Of course . My lunch box was in my locker boom goes the lunch box , in detention goes Billy . But let 's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in detention too so ... Not tonight . Skip me . What about you dude ? Why don 't you tell us who you really are ? Because everyone knows exactly who I am . Okay . What about you , crazy girl ? I could tell you anything and you would have to believe me . Okay . I 'm the new girl . Always . Three schools in three years . I like it that way , you know , it 's just easier . Nobody ever has to get to know me ... my parents don 't have to worry about my relationships . Boyfriend troubles ? Yeah . Boyfriend troubles . Girlfriend troubles . ? My family is so normal . Too normal . They believe in labels . They would like for me to ... dress differently . Talk more . Have the kinds of friends they want me to have . I don 't know how to tell them what 's really going on with me . I never said any of this out loud . Well , it 's cool . You with us now . Am I ? What does that mean ? When all this is over ? Are we Power Rangers or ? Are we friends ? Do you know who I am ? Yes . I was once just like you . So pretty . Innocent . Are all the rangers on Zordan 's new team as young as you ? Delightful ! Have you morphed yet ? Trick question . If you could morph , we would be having a very different conversation . The Yellow Ranger . Should I kill you ? I killed the yellow Ranger before . And I loved it ! Oh , you want your armor . I 'll show you mine if you show me yours . No , please , you 're hurting me . You are so strong ! I 'm just kidding . You 've guts full , little yellow ! I see myself in you . I was an outsider on Zordan 's team , just like you . All I need to know is ... where is the Zeo Crystal . I don 't know . Sadly , I believe you . Tomorrow I am going to destroy Angel Grove . But in exchange for your life ... you will find out where that crystal is and you will come to me . We can have a little deal , Didi my friend . - Kim ! - It 's me . How did you get in here ? I am a super hero . And you left your window open . So everything okay ? I think I 'm the reason we can 't morph . I haven 't really been honest . Okay . I punched Ty Fleming on the face ... because he told everyone I was the meanest person he ever met . And he was right . - That cannot be true . - Okay . Whoa ! - Yeah . - You took that picture ? No . Amanda Clark , took that picture , of herself . But she shared it with me privately . She trusted me . And you sent that pic to Ty ? With a text that said . " Is this the girl you wanna bring home to your mom ? " I did not know how mean it was until I saw her face . Kim , there is literally thousands of photos going around school I don 't care about them . I care about this . I did this ! I had to sit in Mr. Detmer 's office with Amanda 's father ... and watched as they showed him the photo of his daughter . In his eyes for the first time I could see who I would become . You know , So I lied . I blamed everyone else . I wanted to die , that 's why ... When you asked me to run away , I was ready . Okay , listen . Start over . Erase that picture right now . - Jason , it can 't be erased . - Then live with it ! You did an awful thing , that does not make you a awful person . Just be the person you wanna be . So we all get the same text . So where is she ? I 'm here ! Look . Rita came to my house tonight . - What ? - Yeah , she 's real . Insane . She nearly killed me . She 's trying to get me to join her . She said she 'd spare my life - if kept a secret . - What secret ? Act on the destruction of Angel Grove begins . - This is real . This is the end . - No , it 's not . Where is she ? She said to me hear what the dead ships live . That 's the boatyard by the docks , right ? Let 's go ! Are you serious ? No one ? Jason . We are not even power rangers yet . I say we go back to Zordon . Ok ... The only reason Zordon wanted us to become Power Rangers ... Is so that he can come back to life . Why makes you say that ? Because he told me . - Wait , so all this a lie ? - Of course it was a lie , Billy . We failed . Let 's stop being delusional about being a team of superheroes . We are all screw-ups . And as much as I hate this scrubby bullshit town ... I don 't wanna just sit around and watch it die okay ? Let 's go and do the one this that 's been asked of us and kill Rita . You know this is really a bad idea , right ? The worst . Let 's vote . Shove hands . Let 's do it . Okay . Okay . Let 's go . - take the left , take the right . - Got it . We 'll untie . Hold it . No no . Let 's just think about this , okay ? Oh shit . Right on time . I was beginning to think you were too dumb to know where the dead ships live . Let 's play . Five little Rangers tied up like fish . The Leader ? Hello , Red . You 're not entirely disappointing . Look at you , trying to figure out my plan . I will just tell you . Yellow has led you to your death . Because I 'm going to kill you ... one by one , until you tell me ... Where 's my crystal . We don 't know . No , Red . You don 't know ! But guess what . One of you does . Who could it be ? Eeinie meenie mynie ... Blue . Blue ... so loyal . Pure of heart . Tell the class what you know ! Where is my crystal ? You can tell me now , Blue . Or you can tell me after I kill all of your friends . - Let 's start with Black . - No ! Hey ! no ! No . He dies in three ... two ... Okay , okay ! Don 't hurt my friends , alright ? It 's at doughnut establishment . Where ? What does that mean ? What 's it called ? It 's a Krispy Kreme . Krispy Kreme ? Krispy Kreme . This is a special place ? - Very Special . - It Must be . The Source of life itself is buried there . Thank you Blue for being so weak . Zordon will lose all respect for me If I don 't kill you . - At least one of you . - What ? No ! Billy ! Billy ! Billy ! - Jason , we gotta help him . - Billy ! Billy ! You are not ready to kill me . You are not worthy . Give me your hand ! - Billy ? - Is he gonna be okay , right ? Come on . Hey hey . You can , spec guy Come on . He 's dead . He is dead . No . We SHOULD start a band . Pick him up . Help me pick him up ! Come on ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Come on , Billy . We got you , buddy . Take him , take him to the cave . Yeah . - Put him down . - Okay . - Slow slow . - Master Billy . Do something , ok ? There must be something you can do for him . I told you that you were not ready . Zordon please help us , okay ? Please ! There is nothing that I could do for him . We were both reckless with our teams . No . I am sorry . I 'm sorry , guys . He 's dead because of me . No , Jason , it was all of us . No I pushed it . And as usual , I made the wrong decision . Out of fear , anger ... I don 't know , It 's just so angry . He 's a great kid , you know . And he loved us . He loved being a Ranger . I 'm sorry , Billy . I 'll trade my life for yours if I could . Maybe he traded his life for us . Yeah probably he did . I would . Me too . Yeah me too . Me too . Just the four of us now . The truth is ... whatever we 've said to each other ... It does not matter . This ... this is the only thing that matters . She is right . Zordon ! Zordon ! Look at the Grid ! This is your time ! Do you see it ? The grid is open , step through ! Yes , I see it . I see it . Get through , Zordon ! - Hey ! - What 's happening ? The Morphin ' grid is open ! What 's going on ? Zordon ? Master ? Where is he ? He must have stepped through the grid ! Alpha where did he go ? I don 't know where he is . Zordan , what ? Why didn 't you step through ? That was your only chance . I know . But only one can come back . Oh my God . Billy ! - Billy ! - Oh my God . ! Are you okay ? You 're not dead ? - Yeah . - No . A little bit .

 COULSON : Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... I 'll take you to a place where you can be with people like us . You can learn about yourself , your gift . My name is Jiaying . I have chosen to be your Guide . Forgot I was working with The Cavalry . Don 't ever call me that . I 've heard the stories . What went down in Bahrain . She went in , crossed off the enemy force . Didn 't say how . Did she lose anyone in there ? Herself . ( WATER RUNNING ) ( SHOWER DOOR OPENS ) ( CLOSES ) Mmm , you 're up early . Hey , we 've got a family to make , and there 's only one way to do that . And I 'm dedicated to the cause . Hmm , so thoughtful . ( CHUCKLES ) When you get back , maybe you and I can take a trip . Hmm . - Somewhere warm . - Mmm . Focus our efforts to expand . He 's gonna be a hell-raiser . Uh , not in my house . My house has rules . Oh , so you plan on being exactly like your own mother ? What ... - With a few modifications , yes . - ( DOORBELL RINGS ) ( SIGHS ) He 's always early . Stall him . Come on in ! It 's open . - Andrew , good morning . - Hmm . You really leave your front door unlocked ? Uh , I got the best security system in the world . And you 're early . This is my time . Sorry . So who you going after ? Am I about to get a new patient ? Don 't know yet . But , yeah , maybe . Hey . No leaking operational secrets . Come on , Coulson , we 're going to be late . I 'm early . ( CHUCKLES ) Keep her safe out there . She 's supposed to keep me safe . ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah . Hey . You be careful . I will . And when I come back , we 've got work to do . Come on , I gotta go . O 'Brien , thanks for the tunes . - Anytime . It 's one dull flight . - ( CHUCKLES ) This really a Gifted individual ? What do we know ? Not much , yet . You know they 're retiring this fleet ? About time . ( SIGHS ) S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s putting every dime into the Triskelion . Well , not all the dimes . Fury 's quietly started a new initiative . Instead of this catch-and-release with powered people , we form a team . Take Earth 's mightiest , find out if they 're heroes . And you mention this because you want my help ? Well , I know you 've got the family planning thing going on ... I 'm staying in the field . Good . Because you 'd be great . And that way , we could keep working together . Mmm-hmm . Uh , one mission at a time . Look alive . COULSON : Agent Hart . We 've got her , Phil . Gather up ! Meet Eva Belyakov . Thirty-five , Index candidate . Russian intelligence has been pursuing her . Agents Coulson and May have been brought in to advise and make the approach . Thank you . We believe Ms. Belyakov possesses enhanced strength . This is what happened when a Russian officer tried to stop her with his car . She fled Russia unharmed . Looks pretty strong to me , so it 's important we don 't spook her . Just a friendly chat to bring her in for evaluation , and if all goes really well , we could gain an asset before the Russians find her . The approach will be public . It 's not ideal , but we go in now or we lose our window . Local military 's not used to standing down . Welcome to Bahrain . Let 's hope Belyakov cooperates . And if she doesn 't ? Then I call in the cavalry . ( GUNS COCKING ) MORSE : Gonzales has Shanghai quieted down . Agents will extract in two hours . WEAVER : Are we having any issues following Agent Fitz ? You tailed him ? He resigned . Fitz has a lot of ideas . We 're just making sure that he doesn 't get any crazy ones . Like seeking out Coulson ? We find answers where we can . Perhaps you can fill in a few of the blanks . Specifically about powered people . What about Project Deathlok ? How long has Coulson been running Mike Peterson ? Their contact has been minimal . He wasn 't an active asset . Seems pretty active to me . Do you expect us to believe he 's not part of Theta Protocol ? You can at least tell us what you do know about it . Coulson doesn 't bore me with the details of every little operation . May , we know this is massive . We have evidence that Coulson has quietly been moving alarming amounts of resources and manpower all over the globe . The only thing we 've found linking all these activities is a code name , " Theta Protocol . " There 's no more details he 's shared with you ? Any director of S.H.I.E.L.D. has secrets . We 're not talking a few black bag operations . Take your entire current budget and match it with this one program . That 's why we wanna open Fury 's Toolbox . For answers . Well , I 'm sure there 's a simple one . Let me take charge of my base and I 'll talk Coulson in peacefully . That 's great . But so we 're on the same page , all our intel on Coulson . You know him best . Tell us , are we right to worry ? I know Coulson 's not our enemy . JIAYING : I want to know where you 're from . Did you make friends there ? SKYE : At S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Yeah . They 're like family . Or they were . Until you changed . They sent agents after you ? I don 't know what happened . I know I impaled a guy . Who shot at you . No , I lost control . Do you understand your gift ? I make things shake . ( LAUGHS ) Well , not really . Everything is shaking already . Vibrating at its own natural frequency . This stone . The wood in the trees . I believe you can learn to sense those frequencies around you and resonate with them so that not everything is shaking , only what you choose . Sense a frequency ? How do I do that ? ( CHUCKLES ) I don 't know . I 'm not the one with the gift . I just work here . You think I can hear the stone ? ( SKYE SIGHS ) ( GASPS ) Whoa . You 've gotta be kidding me . ( CHUCKLES ) Can you hear it ? No . Not the stone , the mountain . It 's the loudest thing here . ( CHUCKLES ) Well , now , take that frequency and see if you can amplify it . The last time I did something like this , a lot of people got hurt . You can 't hurt the mountain . And you 're not gonna hurt me . Don 't be afraid . ( EXHALES ) ( RUMBLING ) ( GASPS ) ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) I moved a mountain . Remember that feeling . It 's not something to be afraid of . ( GOATS BLEATING ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Faisal Ahmed , may I introduce Agents Coulson and May . Faisal is with Bahraini National Security . Pleasure , sir . Your people have been tracking her ? Yes . We followed Miss Belyakov to a caf√© in this market . This is a very dangerous area . Black market importers , thieves . Not a place for tourists . So she didn 't come for falafel . She could be meeting with anyone . FAISAL : Whatever she wants , it is not good . Unless she leaves with you , our military will take her . This is our window . Fury will have our asses if an Index candidate ends up in government hands . Okay . We 'll make this work . ( LOCAL MUSIC PLAYING ) Hello . May I ? My name is Phil Coulson and I 'm here to help . My group specializes in helping people like you , who have gifts . And why should I trust you ? Because I can take you somewhere safe . I know you 've been on the run , but S.H.I.E.L.D. can protect you . You 're not alone in all this . MAY : Locals incoming . Gun . Blue shirt . Agent O 'Brien , make sure they don 't interfere . Why don 't we go somewhere more secure ? Hey , can I talk to you for a minute ? No . I like it here . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Coulson , you 're running out of time . These men can 't help you . Let 's talk somewhere calmer . What is it you 're looking for ? Pain . ( MEN EXCLAIMING ) Easy . Drop your weapons now . - COULSON : Easy . - Step back ! - Drop the damn gun . - ( GIRL WHIMPERS ) - No ! - Easy ! COULSON : Let her go ! Just put the girl down , and I 'll come with you . Let my men go , we can all walk away from this ! Stay back ! Do not follow us ! ( SPEAKING ARABIC ) ( GRUNTS ) SKYE : So what happens next ? JIAYING : Eat like crazy , then rest up . This afternoon will be much harder . SKYE : Than the avalanche ? Now I need to take care of something else . I 'm very proud of your work today . Wow , training go that well or that badly ? I caused an avalanche . ( CHUCKLING ) Is that a good thing ? Yeah . It 's good . You know , it 's really impressive for Jiaying to take anyone under her wing . Yeah ? Yeah . I like her . I just ... I can 't ... What 's her role here ? Her role is " in charge . " So really , she must like you . What kind of contraband you got there ? I knew you 'd be training . - Hey , Lincoln ? - Yeah ? If she 's in charge , how often does she train people ? Since I 've been here ? Let me see ... Never . Saw the look on your face when we mentioned Mike Peterson . Tell me if I 'm wrong , but Coulson didn 't just keep the specifics of Theta Protocol from you . I get the feeling that , until we said it , you 'd never heard it before . That gut punch that you felt today ? That 's how we 've felt for months . I swore to build S.H.I.E.L.D. back up the right way . And I don 't think Coulson is a bad guy . But a secret as big as Theta Protocol ? I can 't ignore that . Whatever he 's doing , it needs to be out in the light of day . You 're worried that I don 't understand your choice . Well , sometimes that 's the price of doing the right thing . No one will understand , and it hurts like hell . ( SIREN WAILING ) The warehouse connects directly to the market . Once they holed up inside , my men cut off both exits , the alley and the market entrance . COULSON : It 's a rats ' nest in there . Coulson . We ID 'd Belyakov 's friends . Local militia , street gang , basically . That 's their stronghold . Okay . I 'm going to call Agent O 'Brien , see if they 'll negotiate . ( LINE RINGING ) O 'Brien , is that you ? You okay ? O 'BRIEN : Leave us alone . Can you talk ? Are they making demands ? Put me on with Belyakov . - Just leave us alone . - ( BEEPING ) " Leave us alone " ? Is he trying to warn us away or ... We tried it the nice way . It 's time for my team to do its job . - Let 's move out ! - MAN : Yes , sir . I should go in . Let them do their thing . Now we find out what kind of monster we 're dealing with . - ( HISSES ) - ( INHALES SHARPLY ) Easy . This will help . Unless you 're removing them , you 're not helping at all . Once your gifts have revealed themselves , we will train you how to use them . I don 't want to train , I want to leave . My only gift is to be the scary monster under the bed . You are not a monster . I can 't even look in the mirror . My days are a pain . Every night , I 'm assaulted by constant nightmares . You 'll get through this . Stay out of it , spark plug . Don 't get so wrapped up in your physical changes that you miss out on the gifts layered below . It 's a tough change . What do you know about changes ? Let her vent a little . ( SIGHS ) I 've been through this . It 's hard . But I promise our care is the best thing for you right now . I 'm tired of being caged . I want to feel fresh air . We 'll discuss it later . ( DOOR CLOSES ) LINCOLN : He means well . You know , I might have something to help you sleep . Sleep is easy . It 's the relentless nightmares . I 'm always being hunted like an animal , tangled in thorns . Or I dream of Skye . Skye and her father at dinner , with champagne , a bouquet of daisies . ( CHUCKLES ) And she 's so happy . She got everything and I got thorns . I know this seems impossible , but don 't give up on us yet . HART : ( OVER PHONE ) In position . Thermal showing minimal activity . Alpha set up . MAN 1 : Bravo , good to go . All teams , this is Alpha . Go for breach . MAN 2 : Back entrance secure . Moving upstairs . - MAN 3 : Contact , southwest corner ! - ( GUNSHOT ) MAN 4 : Bravo , check in . MAN 5 : We 're taking hits downstairs ! We 've got civilians here ! I see the little girl . She 's alive . MAN 6 : Friendly fire ! Friendly fire ! HART : All agents , disengage ! Disengage ! Hart , come in . Bravo , come in . All operators , check in . What was that ? Were they taken out or did they take themselves out ? - What about the little girl ? - I don 't know . But I have to call it in . That building just swallowed 1 2 agents in a minute . We 're alone on this . Okay . I play a note , you hold it . Okay . ( GLASS RINGING ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( CONTINUES RINGING ) ( GASPS ) Oh . Your gift is quite destructive , but look at the music you can make . That was amazing . So what , we 'll drink from wooden cups at dinner . ( INHALES ) What 's wrong ? Nothing . That 's just it . Everything is great here . It feels like home . Which never ends well . Ends ? We 're not going anywhere . You sure ? ' Cause mistrust of " home " is my other superpower . Where is this coming from ? Nothing , it 's stupid . I broke a crystal decanter once at a foster family 's house . And now the glass , and ... They sent you back for that ? Well , I tried some of the scotch , too . But , yes . Something bad happens every time I feel settled somewhere . I 'm 25 and I have never spent more than two years anywhere . The second I made friends at the orphanage ? Gone . And God forbid I called a foster family home . Just , " Pack your bags . " I got the news on my birthday once , which was a complete farce because I don 't even know when I was born . I 'm so sorry . S.H.I.E.L.D. was the closest I ever came to having a family . I belonged there . Saw what I could be . Even that ended with agents hunting me through the woods . We are not going to turn on you , or abandon you . This is a safe place . See , you say that , but I know you 're not being straight with me . Why do you care if I stay or go ? And why are you ... July 2nd . ( SIGHS ) ( VOICE BREAKING ) You were born on July 2nd . It was , um , a hot night . And for some reason , I decided to clean the house before I woke your father . Oh , my God ! He said you didn 't age . Cal , he , uh ... He ran over to the neighbor 's house to borrow their car , but didn 't speak any Chinese . So , um , it was a mess . ( WHISPERS ) It 's you . You 're my ... Deep down , I think you knew . ( VOICE BREAKING ) I was too afraid to hope . ( SIGHS ) Are you okay ? I wanted to run to you the second I saw you . Wrap you in my arms . Why didn 't you ? Because you were forced into going through the Mist . Joining our people had to be your choice . You deserved that . At St. Agnes , all the kids , they pray that their parents are out there , looking for them . You were ? For years . After your father pieced me back together , we scoured the Earth . We were ruthless in hunting for you . One morning , I woke up and I barely recognized myself . Your father was buried in the new , horrible man he had become . He couldn 't admit that our baby was gone . I thought I had to accept it . ( VOICE BREAKING ) I 'm so sorry . My sweet angel . I thought if I couldn 't find you , maybe I could help protect others . So I came here . I 'll make up for all of it , I swear . But listen . Right now , this has to be our secret . What do you mean , secret ? Why ? Our people have very strict rules , and they could perceive you as a threat . MAY : Simmons . Ah , May ! Mmm , thank God you 're back . Everybody keeps leaving . They weren 't too harsh on that awful ship ? No , they were very fair . In fact , they gave me command of the base . What does that mean ? It means that if our team makes contact , I answer the call . And it means we 've got work to do . Were you aware that you 've been working on Deathlok technology ? Oh , no , you 're mistaken . That 's a design for a hybrid capacitor . No , it 's Deathlok 's supercharged battery pack . And that may not be the only thing he kept from us . Did Coulson ever talk to you about a project named " Theta Protocol " ? May , I have no idea what that is . Is that why they took Coulson down ? Then what can I do ? We need to find out if they 're telling the truth . I 've been through a lot with Coulson . He doesn 't go off the reservation without a good reason . There are multiple hostages . Our whole damn tactical team . We need emergency backup 1 0 minutes ago . Tell them to send me in . I can fix the problem . I strongly advise sending our specialist inside , Agent May . No , there are agents inside . There 's no time to wait . ( SIGHS ) - Yes , sir . Yes , sir . - ( BEEPS ) - Yay for red tape . They want us to wait . - For how long ? The Bahrainis are pissed . I think they 're about two inches from bombing the building and calling it a night . If they go in , it 's going to be an assault . People will die . I can do this . It 's all about slipping in and pulling them out . S.H.I.E.L.D. is not authorized for any action . ( SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE ) Go . ( HORN HONKING ) Oh , what are we saying this time ? Nuclear ? Bio ? Eh , bio always works . My name is Phil Coulson . I represent the Strategic Homeland Intervention , Enforcement and Logistics Division ! And you are about to enter a quarantine site ! Colonel , you can 't send your men in there . A biological weapon was set off . Nasty stuff . Flesh-eating . Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians . Give my team time to assess . Did you say biological weapon ? Yes , I did . ( BEEPS ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) ( BEEPS ) Hon. What 's wrong ? We 're going off-book here . Hostage situation . Our guys inside . You going in alone ? Babe ... Drew , they have a little girl . Okay . ( SIGHS ) You 've done this before . You always come home . Hey . She 's gonna be scared . Take a knee , get down to her level . It 'll help . If not , then just grab her and run like hell . Thanks . Do good , Melinda . But come home . I love you . Love you , too . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( GRUNTS ) - Coulson ? You read ? - ( STATIC ) Damn . ( GRUNTS ) Agent Hart . Hart , it 's Agent May . We need to go now . HART : It 's dangerous out there . Are you okay ? No . I need your pain . ( BOTH GRUNT ) What the hell are you doing , sir ? We have to go . I need your pain . ALL : I need your pain . I need your pain . MAN : I need your pain . I need your pain . Belyakov is controlling you ! Hart ! That woman is controlling you ! I want your pain . ( GUNFIRE ) I 've got to take her out . - ( BEEPS ) - SIMMONS : If we keep digging , I 'm afraid of what we 're going to find . MAY : Coulson 's reported trips , cross-referenced it with Bobbi 's intel . Most were covers . If he said London , he was meeting in Milan . Or Belgrade , Cairo , buying God-knows-what . My findings aren 't much better . Evidence of construction , I can 't even count the shell companies . Coulson 's burning through money . Bobbi wasn 't lying , May . It 's a whole other life . And , um ... What is it ? Coulson met with your ex-husband . They 've been consulting for a while . Okay . Put it on the map . ( SIGHS ) What 's Coulson even need with 1 00 bunk beds ? MACK : We think he 's building another base , for powered people . In my opinion , Coulson 's determined to explore people with powers . He 's been on the front lines of it his whole career . Avengers Initiative , T.A.H.I.T.I. Everything he 's done since restarting S.H.I.E.L.D. tells me he 's continuing that work . He wouldn 't . Why blow up the alien city ? But why go there at all ? We can debate all day , but if you 're planning on training super-powered people , you 're going to need a lot of bunks . And scientists and money . And you 're definitely going to find a very good psychologist . Simmons , I need you to get me into Fury 's Toolbox . Coulson could have good reason for keeping this quiet . Open the box . Best intentions aside , underestimating powers is playing with fire . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Am I free to go ? Skye had a choice . Are you telling me I can 't leave ? No , I 'm telling you ... I can never leave . ( SIGHS ) - ( GRUNTS ) - ( BOOK THUDS ) I can take you to beautiful places . The pyramids by moonlight , an island untouched by man . But it is too dangerous in public right now . You don 't know that . I 'm a survivor . I know you are . And you 're too good to pity yourself . I know isolation . Pain . Think this face didn 't take some getting used to ? You can teleport . That 's amazing . But first I was blind , lost in the world . These gifts are deeply layered for people like us . Now I can go anywhere , find our people . Well , what was the good in finding me ? If I have a use , I don 't know it . Yet . I will be your Guide . Your beauty will be reflected in a wonderful gift . People like us have to live differently . But it doesn 't mean it can 't be an amazing world . As long as I have you to show it to me . - JIAYING : Ethan . - Hey . I hear you 're headed away . Uh , yeah , I 'm taking some time to backpack . Gordon is dropping me off in Prague , so ... Well , have a good trip . Thanks . There are good people here . He hasn 't been through the Mist yet . You don 't want to tell them because you 're responsible for deciding what to do with me . It 's complicated . Come with me . I 'm responsible for everyone here . Favoritism undermines trust . SKYE : Don 't you want to tell people ? JIAYING : I don 't get that luxury . My rules must be enforced . People have died when the process for selection and training has been ignored . But I already skipped that process . And I protected you from the swift response that usually brings . It 's happened before . There was a woman once . She didn 't trust myjudgment . So she stole a batch of Terrigen Crystals and fled . ( GRUNTING ) Got caught up with some criminals in Bahrain . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Her name was Eva . Russian . Strong-willed , like you . I will feel your pain . ( GROANING ) I feel all their pain . And I grow stronger . May ... The Cavalry ... I know this story . An agent went in and killed her ? I wish it had been that simple . ( GRUNTS ) Stay back , honey . I 'll get you out of here . It 's gonna be all right . EVA : I 've had their pain . Now give me yours . Come on . I 've got plenty to share . ( GRUNTS ) With so much strength , Eva was bound to be noticed out in the world . ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( GRUNTING ) You feel enough pain yet ? Let everyone go and this can end . No . I want more . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( SCREAMS ) ( GRUNTING ) - ( GRUNTING ) - Ahhh ! ( GROANING ) She 's dead . Snap out of it ! KATYA : I like the pain . She didn 't steal the crystals for herself . She stole them for her daughter . Katya . I saw a darkness in the girl . I didn 't think she should go through the Mist . But Eva wanted Katya to receive her birthright . ( GASPS ) - She trusted herjudgment over mine . - ( THUDS ) ( GASPS ) ( GROANS ) You killed Mother . And now there is so much pain . I like all their pain . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) I 'm scared . ( VOICE BREAKING ) I want to leave . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Please take my hand . ( BREATHING SHAKILY ) JIAYING : Katya was too young . She went insane . With one touch , she Ieeched off emotions like a parasite . ( MAY BREATHING HEAVILY ) No ! Not them ! Let them go ! We can fix you . We can help . Just don 't . Take my hand . Give me your pain . I need a new mother . I can take your pain . Stop . Just put your hand down and stop ! Everything is going to be all right . - Just , please ... - ( GUNSHOT ) ( SOLDIERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) JIAYING : Katya had to be stopped . But not by S.H.I.E.L.D. She was my responsibility . You made the rules , and now you 're afraid they 'll think you broke them for me . Our people know too well what a woman will do for her daughter . So we keep our secret . No one will ever know . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( MAN GROANING ) Did you see that room ? How did she take out that many people ? I must have been knocked out . I can 't remember anything . ( DOOR OPENS ) Had to have been 30 guys . But got our whole team out . The cavalry went in after all . Hey . Every agent who walked out of that building is alive because of you . ( VOICE BREAKING ) The girl . I couldn 't save her . ( SOBBING ) She didn 't understand . I tried . It 's all right . You have to let the girl go , Melinda . You did good . Let the girl go . ( SOBBING ) Okay . Okay . ( CONTINUES SOBBING ) We 'll get through this . ( PAPER THUDS ) ( STAMP THUDDING ) SKYE : Are you sure it 's the right thing ? If this is some weird lesson ... It 's not a lesson . This is personal . A debt I owe to your father . And if you 'll trust me in this , I 'll be eternally grateful . He 's a monster . He was good once . ( SIGHS ) Cal lost himself to a promise he made me . Out of love . Now he 's made good . That shouldn 't mean all is forgiven . No . But he never gave up on you . He deserves something for that . Just one dinner . Then you never have to see him again . I 'll have him taken away from here . You promise ? Oh . I had wanted so badly to make everything perfect for tonight , and suddenly it is . Uh ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) These are for you . I want to thank you , both of you , for giving me another shot . I know that my actions ... I learned who my mother was today . And she taught me things . I 've never had that before . That was possible because of you . That 's all I really wanted for you . Cal , uh , Skye doesn 't know when her birthday is . I do ! July 2nd ! It ... It was a gorgeous summer night . Beautiful , big moon in the sky . 1 988 . Huh ? You know , your mother , she actually cleaned before she told me . ( CHUCKLES ) You see , there was only one car in the village , and we didn 't own it . ( CHUCKLES ) So I had to negotiate with the man . He didn 't speak English , and my Chinese ... - ( ICE CUBES CLINKING ) - ... was terrible . ( JIAYING AND ZABO CHUCKLE ) - Wait , ' 88 ? - Mmm-hmm . I 'm 26 ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( LAUGHING ) That 's so messed up . ( CHUCKLES ) Uh , sorry . To 26 . Yes . Here 's to ... JIAYING AND ZABO : Twenty-six . ZABO : Mmm . Anyway , once we figured out the car situation ... Did I tell you it was the Year of the Dragon ? RAINA : I dream of Skye and her father at dinner , a bouquet of daisies . And she 's so happy . ZABO : Then we had to get you to the hospital . Your mother was all fine and calm . I , of course , wasn 't . It 's not a dream . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( SIGH ) It 's been 20 minutes . Sure there 's no window in there ? Mmm-hmm . All right . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hey , buddy , you gonna be all day in there ? Just a minute ! Jeez , let a man think in peace ! ( WHIRRING ) ( BEEPING ) Whoa . Uh ... ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - Okay . - ( KNOCKING CONTINUES ) ( MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH ) FITZ : ( ON TABLET ) Hunter ? How did you ring Coulson 's tablet ? Are you watching Mexican football ? Where are you ? Uh , undisclosed secure location ? Fitz ? How did you open Fury 's Toolbox ? Don 't worry , it 's safe ! I stole it first . - You stole it ? - Yeah . Fitz , you 're amazing . Can we meet up ? MAN : You 're killing me , man . Still in there ? I 'm being followed . They won 't grab me . I think they 're hoping I 'll lead them to you first . Thing is , would it still be okay if I came and hung out with you ? Maybe you could show me how to shake a tail . - Maybe you could start , like , now ? - ( CONTINUES KNOCKING ) You in a bathroom ? With one of those electric hand dryers ? Uh ... Oh , yes . You 're gonna be okay , mate .

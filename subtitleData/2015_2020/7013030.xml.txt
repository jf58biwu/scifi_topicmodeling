 I was in the dining room dry-canning some beans When an angel fell from the damn sky And crashed in my backyard . I screamed and ran out there . And there she was , All of 12 , A lump on the ground , Holding on to a giant lawn umbrella . She had jumped off the roof . Thought the thing would hold her . She broke her arm in two places , But she never cried . Charlene embodied the spirit of this place- - An always-ready , never-quit , Get-it-right-this-time spirit . And she would have ... If she wasn 't risking her life for the unprepared . Pat , thank you . Hello . I just want to introduce my family . I 'm madison clark , and these are my children , Nick and alicia . We wanted to offer our condolences for charlene And for the others you lost . We 've lost loved ones , too . Travis . Travis , he was our compass , and he ... We just wanted to say thank you for sheltering us And thank you for your generosity . We will repay it . Thank you . We 've all lost . We share that . And grieving 's hard , But it 's important that we process it- - More important to prepare , jake . Good point ! I 'm sorry . There is a time and place for mourning , And patty is owed that . But who brought down the helicopter ? We aim to find out , vernon . When ? We 're gonna get to the bottom of this . What 's your timeline ? Jeremiah , please . Nothing 's changed , vernon . Make no mistake , we 're in a wartime posture here . We tasked alpha station to scout the crash site . When we know what we 're dealing with , we 'll act . If it 's some wing nut , we 'll act . If it 's a larger challenge , we will act . Payback , vernon . Yeah ! That 's what my father means . Whatever this threat is , large or small , We will make this right . Hey , we 'll mete out justice When we know what it is we 're dealing with . We can 't afford to lose ourselves . We 're more than a mob . We have to be something hopeful in this world . Like my father says , if you plan for the future ... Plan for a better one . Freeloader . Excuse me ? You know the fable " the ant and the grasshopper " ? Hey , what 's your problem ? Let it go . Let it go . They should be harassing troy , not us . I think they would be if they knew what he had done . Madison and alicia , i 'm gretchen trimbol , vernon 's daughter . Saw you at the meeting . Welcome . I 'd shake , but it wouldn 't be sanitary . Damn hangnail can take you down these days , You 're not careful , you know ? I 'm so sorry for your loss . I wish i 'd have had the pleasure of knowing travis . Thank you , gretchen . Hey , alicia , the rest of christ rizen and i were wondering If you wanted to join us for bible study . Oh , we 're not really- - when is it ? Tonight . One hour , two , tops . Music , punch , and the lord , of course . What , uh , is christ rizen ? Oh , sorry . Christ rizen is our band . That 's terry and gabe . You 'll meet geoff if you come . We 're jewish . Cool . We 'll do old testament . Corral at 5 : 00 . We need supplies , nick . Water , weapons . We must be ready to leave . They 're going to take the cuffs off soon . You can walk around and see the place . No . Eat , luciana . I can 't forget what they did . i know . As soon as they free me , we go . I just want us all to feel safe in one place . I had a chance to make that happen . I had a chance to kill him . But ... That would not have made us safe . And you know this . This is not you , nick . You 're not a killer . How 's luciana ? Oh , still alive . I liked your speech . I liked how you said his name . Travis . It makes him matter . Makes him real . He was real . That 's not why you said it , though . It wasn 't out of grief . It was pointed . You wanted to remind us that you 're a victim , too . You feel like a victim ? Are you analyzing me now ? No . What did you do in the old world ? Guidance counselor . At a high school ? Oh . I never attended . " certain social aspects of academia Proved challenging for troy . " You must have been lonely . No , no . No , i , uh ... I had this place . Everything that i do is in service to this place . Does your father believe that ? Yeah , he understands . You know , complicated problems call for complicated solutions . Killing people 's not complicated . It 's simple . Do you see ? You understand this world . You understand me . That 's why i picked you . But i didn 't- - i didn 't pick nick . He comes with me . Package deal . Why were you separated ? Why was he with strangers and not his family ? He doesn 't deserve his place here . I think you know it . He 'll earn it . That was made this morning , troy . Hey , hey , hey , hey , dante 's not gonna be happy- - Hey ! Hey , you 're making a mistake . Huh ? ! You 're making a mistake ! This is a mistake ! Victor ... Don 't . They don 't want us here . Most of them don 't mind . The ones who do , we win them over . You want to win over troy ? Work in progress . In the meantime , both of you stay away from him . Not sure i can do that . The hell you can 't , nick . You don 't know what sets him off . He doesn 't know what sets him off . Okay , but if we stay , we need to do something . What does that mean ? I 'm doing something . No , what do you mean , nick ? What are you gonna do ? Do you want my knife ? You gonna do something ? All i 'm saying is that ... We should start over somewhere else , okay ? Like find a house , grow crops . We don 't have to stay here , that 's all . Farming 's more your style . We have options . We 're not leaving . Why ? We 're not leaving ! Why are you so convinced That this is the place , mom ? Because it 's all we have . Because there 's no place better . Because we hauled you out of that hell hole And travis died because of it . Luciana won 't be safe here . They let her in . What if they make her go ? You 'll have a choice to make . Something 's wrong . That 's not many klicks for mccarthy to cover . We should have heard back by now . How many times did you and charlie fly that route ? Six times in four weeks , maybe . People tend to knock before they enter . Or is this different back in angel city ? Front door was open . What do you need , madison ? Reassurance . You took us in and i thank you for that , but- - And you are welcome . But some people here resent us . Well , that 's natural . You are strangers . We 're not strangers to troy . What did he do ? Broke into our place , threatened nick . I 'd like you to keep a leash on your son . And i 'd like you to help us with the other people . The ranch ain 't my autocratic plaything . Its residents don 't bend to my whims and wills and fancies . It 's a place for free people who only ask for help When they need it . I 'm asking . I need it . You a hard woman to like , madison ? I 'm extremely goddamn hard to like When someone threatens my family , and that 's what troy did . That 's fact . If jake hadn 't shown up at the depot , We 'd be dead . That 's fact . And it 's something no one here seems to give a shit about . Whoa , whoa , whoa . No need to curse . He murdered people , and he called it science . Maybe the ranch should know that . Yeah , i 'm starting to grasp why folks ' fondness fails When it comes to you , madison . Dad , she 's justified- - uh ... If my people take umbrage at your presence , That 's on you . I won 't let anyone drown Without teaching them how to swim . Jake , show her the lectures . Did troy hurt you ? Has he always been this way ? I 'll take care of him . Okay . Yeah , you and your dad keep saying that . Thank you ... For saving alicia . Well , she saved me , too . She ... All right , i 'm going to put on some coffee . You 're going to need it . You worried about the helicopter ? Nah . It 'll turn out to be some crackpot scavenger . Whoever it is , i want to meet him . Our country is ablaze . If only our ancestors can see the chaos of modern america . You gonna ride ? Dad used to take me to the equestrian center . No , i 'm not riding . I 'm waiting for gretchen . Going to her first bible study . We stay , we should get to know them . You 're invited . So ... Is that what you want ? You want to stay ? No . But i 've seen what it 's like out there , And it 's all just different circles of hell . Why not this one ? Sorry what mom said . It wasn 't fair . It 's not wrong . Bad time to form a conscience . What happened to you out there ? the boar 's back . Keeps digging up the fence posts to get to the cabbage . Could use an extra pair of hands tracking it tonight . Stay away from madison and her family . They 're my friends . They came here under my invite . They trust me . They came here not to get eaten . I wouldn 't flatter yourself . Yeah , but they 're staying 'cause i said i 'd protect them From you . And how are you going to do that ? Please don 't do this . Troy , please . I 'm the one that still believes in you . Well , i don 't need you to anymore . Yeah , you do . You do . If the ranch knew what you really are ... And what am i , jake ? Do you really think that you were helping Those people out at the depot ? I think i was helping all of us . Troy ... When dad 's gone , This is all on us . We have to take care of this place . We have to lead ... Together . Yeah . But i need you to do something for me . I need you to stay away from the clarks . Do you hear me ? Yep . I hear you . Do you mean it ? I always mean it , jake . How much further ? We 're here . You first . All right , everybody . Get your study materials . Greens to the new girl . She is one of god 's chosen people . This is not what i expected . Go your way . Eat your bread with joy And drink your wine with a merry heart , For god has already accepted your works . You have turned my mourning into dancing . You 've removed my sackcloth And clothed me with gladness . you said " sackcloth . " " we can be heroes " playing So , where is geoff ? Say hi , geoff . If you 're gonna plan for the future ... Plan for a better one . Cut it . I look like an asshole out there . I didn 't know what the hell i was saying . I told you to use the cue cards . I don 't need goddamn cue cards . I know my lines , okay ? Okay . Now , what i want you to do is pick up that sniveling idiot . Why don 't you pick him up ? I 'm going back to the house . No , you 're staying right here . Hey ! You 're staying right here . We 're gonna do another . You hear me ? Enough ! It isn 't enough . It 's enough when i say it 's enough . I 'm tired ! You 're not tired . You 're thirsty , that 's what you are . You 're goddamn thirsty . You 're hurting me ! jake , tend to your brother . Let 's do this again , okay ? One more take . We 'll do it again . Sorry , no . See what you started ? Jeremiah , let her go . Why don 't you just shut up , okay ? Just shut your damn mouth . Not my finest moment . How far did you get ? I didn 't get through the first tape . It 's funny , where we start and where we end up . What happened to their mom ? Troy 's mom . Jake 's was my first wife . I was married twice before i gave up The sacred institution . Did she die ? Yeah . Before . My father was a drunk , like her . The booze kill him ? In a way , yeah . Drink took tracy . Got real ugly at the end . Troy tended to her , and ... Fed her and cleaned her . She hated him for it . Where were you ? Selling buckets . I suffered the same affliction . No , no , no , no . It was the night before we signed the paperwork For the fortuna resort . I 'm positive . It was that night , because we were never sure We were gonna close the deal . Thomas 's counter was aggressive . Either way , the sun had come up , And you and thomas were making crepes chocolates On a bonfire of god knows what . It was the wood case of the vino hormaechea ' 89 . And all the while i was singing juan gabriel to a cactus . yeah , that 's right . Oh , man . I 'm ... I 'm assuming ... Thomas did not ... ? Huh . So , you escaped this hotel in this crazy woman 's car , And all you have with you are your wits and charms And this crunchy suede coat ? don 't forget my good looks , dante . Well , it 's nice to be back with a like mind . Salud . Salud . He wants to know where you 're from . El sereno , los angeles , california , America , north america , earth . Geoff wants to know what it 's like out there . Chaos . Ruin . And it changes you . Not like geoff . Something worse . Can i ask geoff something ? Sure . Who are the ottos ? Our founding family . They made this place before most of us were even born . Jeremiah saw what was coming . And how long you guys been here ? It varies . Most came when the event began . Geoff showed up a week after t.E. He was the first one we saw like that- - Dead alive . Geoff claims he 's from flagstaff , But i doubt it . He 's indifferent on the ottos , Except troy . Geoff is not a fan . troy took geoff 's body . Troy 's done a lot worse than that . Troy and the militia do what we can 't . They protect us . You can 't rely on the troys of the world . Not anymore . We 've been behind the fence since this started , alicia . We can 't do what he does . Sometimes you have to handle your own shit . Geoff wants to know What bad stuff have you done out there ? I killed a man . How did it feel ? Easy . Â ¿ quÃ © ? Â ¿ quÃ © ? Â ¿ quÃ © ? This man was cartel before the fall . His function was to take from honest people And to kill those who refused . Which he did . See , in my world now , there is no room for such people . No , no , no , no . Hey ! Hey ... Dime ... Did you truly think that we were friends in the old world ? We made each other money . That 's very american of you , victor . I know why you 're here . It 's why you were always here . You want what is not yours . You wanted my people 's land , and now you want my water . Everyone wants your water . Not everyone is quite as thirsty as you . I 'm not here to take from you . Some food , shelter , a cocktail , perhaps . That would suffice . No , no , no . Nothing suffices . Nothing satiates . You cannot help your need to take . It is in your nature . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! You need me , dante ! You need me ! Hold it . Â ¿ cÃ ³ mo ? You 're begging for an attack . You can 't sell so close to your source . It 's only a matter of time before they try to take it , not me . Oh , you wish to serve me ? Yes , i wish to serve . You wish to advise me ? Yes , please . Listen to me . You must sell off-site . And for that , you need transport . Guns and more men And ammunition to guard that transport . I can organize that . Water is the currency now . How could i ever trust a thief ? I never stole from you . You stole from thomas . We can work this out . Did- - did thomas die believing that you loved him ? I did love him . You will say anything . Aah ! No , please ! Please ! No ! Why are you doing this ? So you suffer . You exploit everything that you touch . And for that , you owe a debt . You will work it off . You will feel just like the people that you 've taken from . You will feel powerless . " once in a while " playing in background A bunch of us are going hunting . You can join if you 're not too busy Watching old folks bone . Middle of the night ? Boars are nocturnal . Catch them sneaking around in the dark . Nah , i don 't hunt . This is more- - it 's more maintenance than hunting . More cultivating than killing . Come . Earn your keep . Evening . Jake tells me your son went out on that boar hunt . Nick doesn 't hunt . He 's a city kid . You don 't have guns in the city ? Not in my house , no . Now ? Now 's now . How long does this hunt normally last ? Well , it varies . A couple hours , all night . Boys are fierce creatures . They 'll come back safe . Alicia must have read the entire book of moses by now . Some mothers might be happy . My daughter 's finding god ? Finding place . They never had that . Place . Nick 's an addict . Spent the last five years Waiting on a call from the morgue . Today i told him if he left , i 'd let him go . But here you are . Here i am . Things we do to our children . And the things we do for them to make up for it . You want to know why i tolerate my son ? Come on , take a walk . Such ! Such . Such . Such . Such . Such . Fass , fass , fass , fass ! Go , go ! Hey ! Go , go , go , go ! Move ! Where are we going ? Underneath my house . My tapes didn 't make me the lightning rod i hoped to be , But enough people woke , Invested in the vision . We call this the pantry . Some say this mess we 're in is revelations , God 's vengeance . I 'll tell you what it is . It 's an opportunity . A new life . A chance to make amends . I broke troy in that old world . In this one , he has a purpose . We all do . And nothing heals a family More than that . We will build something better than before . It won 't be easy , madison . You think your family 's up for it ? Absolutely . The ground 's soft . You could dig a grave real easy . I mean , people would suspect you , but ... Well , they really wouldn 't know for sure . I wonder how long it 'll take you to turn . Eighty-seven minutes . Eighty-seven minutes given my weight , bmi , age . You know , if you do do it , You should time it . Journal 's in my pocket . You are not a scientist . Time it . Nick ... Please . What is wrong with you ? Newton stabbed his own eye To understand the nature of light . I just ... I need to know . I need to know why we spoil . Hey ! Hey ! hey ! I think we can be friends now . You should be sleeping . How 's your wound ? Better . Thank you . For what ? Waiting for me to heal before we leave . I 'm sorry for travis . He saved my life . He was a good man . A much better person than i am . He saved us . We 're not going to throw that away , are we ? We survive now ... At all costs . Turning water into wine ? Praise jesus . Everybody , listen up , please . I just got updated on outpost alpha . Mccarthy and his unit went out 36 hours ago , And we ain 't heard nothing back . Could mean a hundred things , 99 of them benign . But we always got to prepare for the one-off . Troy here is gonna take a party out , But we 're gonna need volunteers . Blake . Mike . Coop . Jimmy . And madison clark . All right , everybody , enjoy your meal . Your kids are over there . I know . I knew you would drink it all .

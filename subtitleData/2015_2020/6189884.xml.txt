 It 's election time again , so can I count on your support for school trustee ? - I 'm thinking of running against you . - Really ? We can 't afford a campaign . We would like to buy your business . There 's only one way to launder money . You guys need a front . With Bubbles , the sky would be the limit . Perfect . Who 's Sarah ? How do you know that name ? I know that name because you were dreaming and you said it . Cosima , the book . I think Rachel knows the code . I want you to tell me what you know about Castor . - Ru-ru-rumors . - No , no , no . Yes , there was a deal made for you , but I didn 't make it . Mrs. S did . I 'm not leaving without you . It was never Beth I loved . Run ! You came back . Come , Sestra . ¿ Otra vez ? ¡ No creo a esta puta ! ¿ Cómo lo hizo ? Look what I found , Sestra . Now we eat and drink . Una cerveza y , uh , agua . How do you say " food " ? Food . Paul ... Paul was a good man in the end ? I don 't want to talk about it . Where is Benjamin ? He 's never late . This Benjamin belongs to S. No , no . Look , he 's one of our friends , okay ? And S ' people are the ones who are bringing papers , so you be thankful . I will kill S for betraying me . You 're pregnant , mi amiga . Did you tell her that I have baby ? Hello , Helena . Helena ! It was me . I made the decision to give you up so I could get Kira and Sarah out of Dyad . You sold me . I will kill you . We have to talk this out , Helena . It 's the only way . The only way out for you is ... Ah . Not in my cantina . First I eat . Then we fight . They 're best left alone . What do you know about it ? I know women . Your sister is very wounded . In my room , there is a shower . Go wash off where you have been . Where you 're going will be better . Thank you . Adjusting the district boundaries to exclude Bailey downs is not the family-first option . As school trustee candidate and a mother of two , I am ... I am ... I am missing a card . I 'm missing a card . 110 over 90 . That 's really good . Which is a miracle , given the state you 're in . - Wait , wait , wait . - I 'm never gonna get this speech right . Here . Open up . Donnie , do we ... have to do this self-monitoring thing right now ? Let 's just keep Dyad on our side , okay ? Okay , we need to get these signatures in by 2 : 00 P.M. , candidates mixer starts at 3 : 00 , we need to go to Bubbles and get my mother to sign over the store , and you and Jage need to go to Mr. Pouzihno ... Not " Jage . " Jason . Temp 's good . How 's your menstrual flow ? Donnie . You and Jason need to take the money to Mr. Pouzihno 's . Yes , 30k , I 'm on it . I do the deal for the pills , we close Bubbles with your mother , and then we finally have a legitimate front . Hendrixes , next level . - God willing . - Right ? Hey , come on . Don 't leave me hanging , baby . Next level . Does my hair look terrible ? My mother 's going to notice if I didn 't get a trim . And my menstrual flow is normal . Oh . Thank you . I hope she 's in a good mood . You know how she can get . Just don 't let her get under your skin , honey . Hello ! - Customers . - Best ones ever . We 'll take the whole darn place . Just a smidge late . Hi , Connie . Donnie . You came , too . Yikes . Oh , I 'm having it trimmed this week . - Ah . - This is quite a display , Connie . Oh , it 's my new male line , minty gleam . Yeah , yeah , we know . We 're going to musk up the recipe a little bit . You know , for the young customers , the body spray set . Maybe . Or , um , maybe not . We 'll ... we 'll discuss it with you , of course . This is the paperwork . Are you sure you can handle the down payment ? Mr. Chubbs here just lost his job . Yeah ... oh , yes , we 're a bit tight , but , yeah , we 're fine . I just wouldn 't want my grandchildren feeling the pinch . No , no no no . No pinching , not on my watch . Retiring to Florida , Mom . - Sunshine state . - Mm-hmm . Well , lawyers make more mistakes than you and Mr. Chubbs put together . I need to read this . Uh ... Okay ! That 's fine . That 's fine . I will be at the candidates mixer all afternoon . You 're still going through with it ? Yes . You 're voting for Marci Coates ? Well , I voted for her last year . She just asked me to put it up . Easy , baby . Big day . Okay ? Okay . We 'll be back for that . Vroom , vroom vroom vroom . I ... claim this belly ... - Mm-hmm . - in the name of Spain . Mmm . You do love your bug , don 't you ? Oh , yeah , and you love borrowing it . Mmm . Everybody wins . Why do you have to go ? Why ? No . Hi , I 'm looking for Cosima ? Delphine . Hello ... Shay . Cosima , could you come out here for a minute ? You know , whatever this is , it 's not cool . You know what , I don 't really care . Hi . What are you doing here ? I 'll leave you two alone . Excuse me , are you stalking me now ? You know I can find you when it 's important . You should have called me . You wouldn 't have answered . And then you wouldn 't have had the chance to check her out . What do you want ? I 've been testing Leda subjects for the misfolded protein that you share with the Castor boys . - Uh-huh . - And your numbers , your numbers are worrying . Let me and Scott worry about my numbers . Scott is worried , and so am I. We need another urinalysis . You want me to pee in that now ? Are you serious ? Don 't fight me . You know this is important . I 'll see you at work . Good . Don 't come here again . Hello . Scott , I need you to cover for me . What do you mean cover for you ? Old school , " I 'm gonna be late for class " cover for me . Cosima , we need that urinalysis . I 'm ... getting it to you , okay ? Okay . - What about the book ? - Don 't , don 't show Delphine the book . I mean Rachel and the book . Right , sorry . Uh , Rachel painted those symbols . Can she decode the book ? I dunno . - Maybe you can find that out from her ? - No . Felix humiliated her . Plus she scares me . Okay , fine , just cover for me and I 'll deal with it . Honey , where do you want this ? - What ? - Where do you want this ? Oh , don 't ... No , you always tip it , - I didn 't tip it . - And then the cream sways and the nanaimo bars are ... Okay , okay , yep . Jason 's here . Do you have the money ? Yeah , honey ? I 'm fine , okay ? St. Thomas High . Been awhile since we hung out in this lot , huh , Ali ? Uh , you ... You hung out in the lot . I was in the library . Not all the time . Okay , peeps . Let 's get moving . A 'ight . Did your mother sign over Bubbles ? Not yet . There 's been a bit of a hiccup . We need that storefront in order to move all this product . We 'll have it to you by tonight . Signed . Good luck . - You 're gonna be great . - Okay . I 'll take care of him . Thank you . - Hi , Sarah ! - Hi , Alison ! - Big day ! - Did you get your signatures ? - Yeah ... uh , yes . - All that campaigning would be for naught if you didn 't . I 'll put them on your station as soon as I 've settled , okay ? - Okay . - Hello . - Hi . - All right , schedule for this ludicrous event . Photo op , candidates mixer , speeches . Put on this t-shirt . - Mm-hmm ! - Take that hat . Thank you . Thank you for your help today , Felix . You know , I kind of need a distraction while Siobhan ferries Sarah back from hotel Castor . That . Yeah , that . Oh . - What ? - Cosima needs my pee . What do you mean she needs your pee ? What for ? I don 't know , science ? I ... don 't know . If she wants it , she can come and get it . Oh ! Alison , your booth is wonderful . It 's like you 're selling bubble gum . Oh . Felix Dawkins , campaign manager . Oh . That 's an interesting ... choice . May not work for our conservative voters . Oh , was that an intolerant remark ? Your mother , for instance , is very conservative . And she is supporting me . We 're going to dismantle that bitch . Would you like some soap ? Vote for Alison . Alison Hendrix 's phone . Felix , campaign manager , speaking . Christ on the cross , where 's Alison ? To whom am I speaking with ? Her mother ! Tell her my heart is exploding ! Oh , my God . Okay , yeah , hang on . Um ... Hey , excuse us . Your mother is having a heart attack ! A real one ? I don 't know . What ? Why ? Hello , Mother . Help me , Alison . I 'm dying ! Mother , I 'll be right there . What do you mean you 'll be right there ? Are you leaving ? Oh , she does this all the time , Felix . Alison . So , you take these to Sarah stubbs . Forms and signatures , please . Okay , can you hurry back , please ? Because the door 's open to constituents in an hour . Work the room . Okay ? Thank you ! Don 't let this place fool you . Mr. Pouzihno is the only supply you 'll ever need . I mean , before the crackdown on mail order scripts , he filled an entire warehouse with Indian pharmaceuticals . And he knows who I am , right ? Everything 's copasetic ? Donnie , when we 're in there , don 't use words like " copasetic . " Yeah , yeah , no , no , I wasn 't gonna . Yeah . I should have brought Alison . Yeah , you 've made your preference clear . Look , man , are we having a problem here ? Not unless you come between me and my family . Consider your territory pissed on . All right . Come on . Let 's do this . Hey , Pouchy . This is the man I was telling you about . It 's nice to meet you , señor Pouzihno . Nao falo ingles . Minha sobrinha . Uh ... Bom dia . Sinto-me honrado . Voce fala portugues ? Um pouco . My grandfather retired in the Algarve , so ... You 'll see it 's just as we agreed . Right back atcha . Donald . What is that ? Shit . My ... my wife is ... is ... is running for , uh , school trustee . Um ... Escola de ... Administradora . Si , si . Ad-administra ... strador . Um , I happened to grab the wrong envelope . That ... that 's my bad , so you just hang tight , and , uh , I will be right back ... Hey , no bad intentions , Pouchy . He 'll get you the money . You go . Voce fica . Uh , yeah . Sure . Yeah . My wife has it , so ... Yeah . I 'll go . Helena , I 'm so sorry I betrayed you . I 'm ... I know I 've caused you enough suffering . Please say something . Now we fight . I 'm not going to fight you , Helena . You 're pregnant . Why is everyone so worried about my baby ? Why don 't you tell me how you plan to raise this child ? I will find my boyfriend . I didn 't know you had a boyfriend . He is named Jesse . Together we will drive tow trucks and make a home for our babies . He sounds like an honest man . Outside . No . Hit me . You can 't have Sarah without the rest of her family , I 'm afraid . Hit . Me . Join us , Helena . You 're kin . Shit , I hit you ! Sorry ! I 'm so sorry for what I did . I hate you , I hate you ! I 'm so sorry . Please forgive me . I 've got you . I 've got you . Helena , it 's okay . You 're with family now . Oh ! What is it ? Oh , God . It was terrifying . I was dizzy , I had ... Tunnel vision , but ... I 'm ... I 'm feeling much better now . Yeah . Okay . So , not a stroke , then . There 's some lemon water in my bag . Can you get it for me , please ? Mom , I 'm making my campaign speech in an hour . I don 't have time for this . I ... I thought with your issues , you 'd be more sympathetic to a ... a panic attack . What is it ? What 's on your mind ? Out with it , please . Well , you 're not gonna like it . I can 't sell you the store . What ? Here you go , darling . Thank you . Candidates , photo op . Time for photos , everybody . Shit . Five more minutes ! We 're good . Okay . Jesus Christ , Alison , where are you ? Mother , we had an agreement . Well , no , we had a framework , but I ... I just ... I can 't . I started this store from scratch when I left your father . I need this store . - Why , all of a sudden ? - I need it . Why ? It 's never been more than a ... a convenient part-time job for you . Donnie and I worked very hard on that bid . Oh , yes , I 'm sure Mr. Chubbs worked his tail off . Don 't call him that ! Well , that 's his name , isn 't it ? Donald Francis Chubbs . Oh , I lost all respect for that man when he took your name . You insisted he take my name ! Yes ! And he did , and now he 's listed as co-owner . I 'm not gonna let you make this about Donnie . Nobody is good enough . - Not Dad ... - Don 't you say that . And certainly not me , " dramatic Alison " who doesn 't choose her husband correctly , she 'll never be on the stage . Oh , Ali . I 'm certainly never gonna be school trustee . Am I ? _ You know what , I 'm going to win this election . And I 'm recycling this . Uh , Felix , Alison 's not picking up her phone and I really need her pee . I 'm at the back entrance . Hey , Alison , I 'm , uh , at the back door . Meet me at the south entrance . Alison ! Um ... Where are you going ? Nowhere ? Let 's go ! You 're late for the photo op . I really want you to win . Oh ... kay . Alison is absolutely pro-family . She 's got a pro-family dynamic . So take this and support ... Sh ... sorry ! Excuse me , I 'm going to have to steal her away , darling . We 're two minutes to camera ready , okay ? - I need pee . - Well , Alison 's not here and we 're having a bloody crisis ! Get inside before anybody else sees you . Okay . Don 't push me . Put this on . Put it on ! Well , I 'm ... no ! What ? Hide your dreads under this God-awful hat . I 'm not ... no . Felix , I 'm not posing as Alison for photos . - Yes . - I 'm not , no . - You are . - I 'm not ... doing that . I 'm not . I just need her pee . That 's it . Yeah , what 's this for , anyways , and don 't say drug testing , because you 're not a bloody shotputter . No , it 's not ... - Sit . - No . Okay . Delphine 's on this , like , power trip . She won 't leave me alone . I don 't trust her . It 's like planet Dyad shit . Well , now you 're on planet Alison , so if you want her piss , then you 're going to have to play along . Okay . Thank God . Now , you need bangs . Bangs that say unhappy , sexless marriage . That 's them . Okay . Now , doesn 't that look nice ? _ Okay . Instead of mending this fence , I 'm going to take this clay oven . Look at this guy . He 's going to starve our kids . I need the lab . It 's Rachel 's turn for protein testing . Blood , urinalysis . Hello , Scott . A ... gricola . What ? What is it ? Uh , board game ? Medieval farm building . Oh . Teach . Medieval farm building ? I 'm so ... bored . You want to ? Sure . I mean , yeah . Maybe start without the expansions . Sorry , dude . Felix , I can 't see anything . Oh , Jesus Christ , you need to relax , okay ? I know Alison 's got a cactus up her arse , but you 're over-clinching . I can 't see anything , Felix . Well , that 's fine , it 's just stills . Sarah Stubbs . - Hi , Sarah Stubbs . - Hello ! Hi , Alison ... Hendrix . Alison Hendrix , she 's here . Line up for a picture with your future school trustee . Who 's up first ? How ' bout you ? Come embrace Alison . Throw your arms ... - Fudge . - She 's like the mother you never had , or always wanted , or something like that . All right , and , look , big smiles , bigger , okay ? We want to see those teeth gleam in the lens . It 's going to be brilliant , it 's going to be fantastic . Alison . We 've got a problem . What ? Your husband gave these to Pouchy instead of the money . No , no , no , no . No , he gave them the wrong envelope ? Yeah . Seriously , maybe you shouldn 't mix business and marriage . Oh , God . The money 's up there . Okay , okay . Go . Go , go , go . Where is Donnie ? Is he in danger ? Short answer ? Yeah . I 'm going to switch these envelopes . You go wait outside . I think we can get the smiles even bigger than that . I think that we can just drive those cheeks up until it hurts , just a bit . Felix , Felix , come on . _ Freaking hell . What ? Holy freaking Christmas cake . Mother ! Hi . What are you doing here ? I need to tell you something very important . I ... I ... Okay , come , this way . You wait here , and I 'll be right back . No , no , no , no , no . This cannot wait . What is it ? Now ... wasn 't this your Home Ec class ? It 's Family Sciences now , but yes . Oh , you know what , the last time I was in here , you were in tears because you only got an 82 in Cooking . Mom , talk . You said I didn 't think your father was good enough , and it 's time for you to know the truth . He wasn 't . I mean , you know we had to conceive you in vitro because of his low motility . I can 't listen to this right now ! I wanted better stock for my child . So I engaged the clinic to provide an upgrade . A competitive swimmer , Jewish , blonde , oddly . Wait , Dad ... Well , why tell him ? I mean , my point is if I seem disappointed in your life choices , it 's only because I tried to give you every opportunity from day one . You need to wait here . Hey ! Hey ! Did you get the money ? No , I was getting it , I got ambushed . Would you ... would you entertain my mother for a second ? Just keep her away from the mixer . All right . Okay , guys , it looks like Mrs. Hendrix is all done . Thank you very much . Full schedule . She 's in Mrs. Green 's room , okay ? Thank you . You owe me . You owe me Alison pee . Okay , okay , okay . Well , um , we 'll hide you in the loo and then I 'll bring Alison in afterward , when the time 's right , yeah ? - Okay . - Okay ! Let 's go . Okay . You 're a medieval farmer . Each turn , you get two choices to build your farm ... one for you and one for your spouse . You can build fences , plant crops , have children . Not seriously . Oh , yes . This is how we do it , Rachel . Anyone comes in , we 're farm building . Now , there are 14 game rounds in six stages , with a harvest at the end of each stage . Oh , my God ! Okay . Look , you 're safe . Um , Cosima 's in the bathroom and she really needs your piss . Okay . Well , these are my campaign signatures . We accidentally gave Sarah Stubbs an envelope with 30,000 cash in it . What ? Alison ? What is going on ? You know what ? I quit . This is ridiculous . No ! No , no no ! Felix , Felix . Okay , okay . We 're drug dealers . Donnie and I are dealing pills and we mixed up the envelopes and now he 's being held captive by some man called Pouchy . Pouchy . Pouchy as in the crime lord that cut off Vic 's finger ? Maybe . There are not two Pouchies , darling . Sinto muito . I 'm confident that we will get past this and we will make a lot of money together , am I right ? So , tune-ups and oil changes , too , or , uh ... I just got a new car , and if you go to the dealer for ... My Uncle worries you 're not taking us seriously . No ! You 'll get the money ! He will ! He 'll get it ! I 'm going there myself . If I don 't have the money in 30 minutes , you lose your nose . No ! No , no ! Do you know what ? I 've got a friend here who 's a casting director , and I really think you two should meet . - Really ? - Let 's go find him . Okay ! Hi . Hi . Vote for Alison . - Alison ? - Yeah ? Were you slipping something in under the wire ? No . What ... what kind of accusation is that ? Maybe you don 't have enough signatures ? I have plenty of signatures . Marci , do you want to do your soundcheck ? It 's almost time for speeches . How are you at public speaking now ? 'Cause I heard that you , uh , choked on your valedictorian . I had the fl ... flu . Wow . Here you are . Whoa ! God , we were so in love . High school sweethearts . So I hear there 's a hiccup in the sale of Bubbles . Oh , the offer just wasn 't up to snuff . Well , I mean , can 't be easy , handing it over after everything you 've done with it . No , it 's not . Not with Mr. Chubbs on the title to fritter it all away . Yeah , you mean Donnie ? Yeah , it 's a head-scratcher , I 'm not gonna lie . Now , listen , Connie . You 're her mother . I mean , you don 't see the same Alison that I see . I see a beautiful , ambitious , classy young woman with a head for business . I see someone a lot like you . Mr. Kellerman . You charmer . I mean , let 's be serious . We both know who 's going to wear the pants at the new Bubbles , and I think your legacy 's safe . Oh , I am so glad you stayed in touch all this time . Hello , Donnie . Are you all right ? Uh ... Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . Jason 's just a little late , so Mr. Pouzihno 's gonna need you to meet his niece in the parking lot , okay ? Oh , my God ! I 'm serious , just ... Just get to the parking lot , please , Ali . All right , everyone ! To the cafetorium . We 're about to start the speeches ! All right , everyone ! To the cafetorium . Hi , I 'm Alison Hendrix . This is for my husband , so you 'll return him ? Get in . Uh , I have a speech to make . Get in now . The most viable , fiscally responsible option for our growing community is to adjust district boundaries , and if Alison Hendrix were ... actually here ... - Bloody hell . - I would challenge her to argue that very point . Cosima ! Cosima ! Cosima ? - Yeah ? - Hey . Hey , hey , I need you . - Where 's Alison ? - She 's not here , but I need you to take these , I need you to memorize them as fast as you can . I can 't ... you ... You have my glasses . It ... it doesn 't matter . You can improvise ! No . Hey , I ... I don 't know the first thing about school trustee stuff . Seis , oito , nove ... I don 't have time to go through all the way to 30 . Um . Dois . Tres . Quatro . Next we have Alison Hendrix . Alison ? Oito . Nove . Dez . Onze . Alison Hendrix . I guess she 's not here . Oh ! Yeah , I 'm here . Oh ! Okay , our final candidate ! Alison Hendrix , a very active Bailey Downs community member . No , no ! No , no , no , no ! Big guy ! Big guy , big guy , don 't ! Por favor , not my nose ! Nao o meu nariz ! Ola . Esta bem . Oh , my God . Thank you . Thank you ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you , thanks . May I use your restroom ? Um ... I 've been hearing a lot of people talk today about , um , family values , and in my opinion , the most important family value is , um , accepting your family for who they are . Uh , but that doesn 't mean coloring inside the lines , because kids do that . That 's their gift . And ... and as a lesbian ... Oh ... Supporter , and an LGBTQ ... Oh , my God , thank God you 're here . I ... I can 't color inside the lines . I had my speech so ready . I know , I know . Excuse me . So sorry . Come on , come on , get off ! Sorry , I 'm just going to grab , uh , water . Oh , God . That 's a shitshow . Are you okay ? Mmm . I 'll meet you in the bathroom , okay ? Sorry , that was terrible . Good luck . Sorry , parents . Something Marci Coates said just got stuck in my throat . Hey ! There you are . I think I just sweet-talked your mom into a sale . Uh , that 's good ? I think I talked myself into something sweet , too . - What 's that ? - This , Ali . I need to pee . Adjusting the catchbin area of Bailey Downs is not the family-first option . As school trustee and a mother of two , I would not make boundaries my agenda . Instead , I would ... Um ... I ... would ... Family . That 's my ... agenda . - Hey . Thank you . - De nada . Oh , shit ! What happened ? Negotiations . Helena 's outside walking them off . Looks like I 'm gonna be a granny to her baby . You sure about that ? Sometimes family is more than just the people under your roof . Um , they 're people who jump in headfirst who aren 't afraid to make fools of themselves to help you , who don 't hide their faces in shame if you fall down . Paul 's gone . I had these dreams . About Beth . If your family is suddenly bigger than you expected and your house gets too crowded , do you tell your family that they need to find a different place to live ? I was trying to find you , and then Gracie showed up at his door . Oh , she 's , uh ... She 's living with us , by the way . What ? You make room , you adapt , you find creative solutions to keep people together . We both have long stories to tell , huh ? Long trip home to tell them . Oh , I 'm so tired , Mum . I know , love . Our schools are our family . And as school trustee , I will not divide us . Bailey Downs stays in the Glendale school district . I stand for inclusion , not exclusion . I will be your mother hen , and I will keep our chicks together . Jason kissed me ? Yeah , I don 't know what his name is , but yeah . He just came out of nowhere and did it . I ... I don 't hear you peeing , Alison . Did you kiss him back ? No . Are you having an affair ? No , no . Were his lips still really soft ? Just pee , please . No . No , no . No , I won 't do that . You 're going to tell me what 's wrong . Are you sick again ? No , no , this isn 't about me , okay ? This is about this protein in Castor and whether it 's communicable or not . No , it isn 't . Look , I reported my menstrual flow to Donnie this morning . We need Dyad when it comes to our health . Okay ? Alison ? Oh , God . Mother ! I have been looking for you , Alison . You soared out there . Congratulations . You 've got my vote . Oh , and I signed . Bubbles is yours . Yes ! Even with Donnie as , you know , co-owner ? Oh , I know , I know you 'll be at the helm , and I know one day , when it 's time to make a change like I made with your father , you 'll find the strength , too . Sometimes we have to make hard choices , Alison . Who knows ? Maybe Jason Kellerman will still be waiting . I 'm going to introduce you to someone , Mother . - Oh . Mm-hmm . - Okay ? Cosima ? No , no no no . Alison . Come on . Hey , I 'm Cosima . What ? Who is this ? My clone , mother . You think you fooled Dad down at the I.V.F. clinic ? No , you were implanted with a clone . What are you talking about ? You can 't choose your family , can you ? I think ... I think I 'm just gonna take off , so , unless you need me for anything ? No , uh , you go take care of yourself . I ... I mean it . Nice meeting you , Mrs. Hendrix . Oh ! You think that girl is your clone ? That makes logical sense to you ? It 's the truth . Alison , that girl was mulatto . No , she wasn 't . - She wasn 't ? - No . Well , I will never understand that hairstyle . You must be right about one thing . I was duped at I.V.F. That donor was supposed to be exclusive , but clearly that girl 's mother was given some , too . Oh , that would make you her half-sister , darling . A clone is something else entirely . You 're right , that must be it . What a bizarre coincidence . Hmm . But if you want to keep seeing her , why don 't you bring her to the club ... Alison ? Ali . Hey . So I have a feeling ... that you ... are going to tell me something . What is it ? If you don 't have any children , you can only take two actions . You have my ... Book ? - Book . - No . - Yes . - Not your book . My ... my ... my father ... Our ... se-secret language . He didn 't leave it for you , though , did he ? Who , then ? I have a pretty serious health issue . Okay , tell me . It 's a ... auto-immune disorder and it affects my epithelial tissue . It ebbs and flows , lungs and uterus at the moment . Show me . It 's very rare , though . Oh , my God . Oh , shit . Okay . What does it say ? I 'll only tell ... Sarah . Why doesn 't the psycho go live with one of her other sisters ? Because it 's your turn . Sestra Alison has good taste . Yeah , well , she 's very crafty . - In men . - What ? Jason Kellerman kissed you . I 'll talk to him . Looking good , Rachel . She thinks Delphine is going to eliminate her . That 's terrible . So ... creepy .

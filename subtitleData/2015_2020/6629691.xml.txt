 Coulson : Previously on Marvel 's " Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... I got another glimpse ... into the future . I don 't know when ... but someone on our team is gonna die . Keep the faith , Alphonso Mackenzie . Your friends are very persistent . They keep fighting us . If it happens again , there 'll be no absolution . Every Inhuman is here for a reason and serves a purpose . [ Gasping ] Now you 're free . Ragtag base , I 'm coming home . Hive could create an all-in-one virus that instantly transforms any humans into swayed Inhumans completely under his control . If he finds a way to disperse it high enough in the atmosphere . He could potentially infect a significant percentage of the human race . He has a way . He stole a fully operational warhead . 3x21 - Absolution [ Music ] How long do you think we can survive in here ? We 're the last ones . You always find a way to survive , don 't you ? It 's in our blood . I knew someone was gonna go . I just didn 't know everyone would . Once I connect the wires , I can hack the controls on the module - and finally pilot us back to Earth . - Daisy this is Earth . [ Exhales slowly ] [ Inhales deeply ] [ Exhales ] [ Alarm beeping ] [ Music ] [ Rumbling ] The kill switches to our vests , if it comes to it . How we holding up ? Not sure . It wasn 't designed for this . [ Music ] I 've told you everything I know . I 'm here to provide progress updates based on the intel you gave us ... nothing more . And they only send you . Why ? If anything I tell you jogs any memories , any pertinent information at all , I 'll ask you to divulge . It 's because you 're the only one I didn 't hurt ... personally , I mean . That 's why . Have you thought of any new pertinent information ? [ Sighs ] As I said , Hive 's followers tell him everything , but he rarely returns the favor . I 'm sorry that 's not enough to act on . Well , we are acting on a new lead . We 've located a U.S. missile silo in the Pacific . Seems like a good fit . If that 's where they plan to do it , they 'll be there ahead of you . Yes . The silo 's staff went silent five hours ago . Giyera : Sir , the warhead is in place , and the missile is armed . The man who starts the launch sequence ... is he willing to cooperate ? Yep . Turned out to be a real team player . What about S.H.I.E.L.D. ? I 've warned you about cloaking . And we 've calibrated for it . If they fly anywhere near this island , we 'll see it . Very good . [ Engines rumbling ] [ Music ] We 're looking for the freight dock on the North side . Daisy : Even if you infiltrate , you can 't shut down the launch ... not without government Kill Codes . - We are aware . - Hand-delivered by a D.O.D. official . - It 's not hackable . You won 't be ... - We are aware . I 'm sorry . The answer is no . I 'm asking you for one Missile Launch Kill Code , General . Violating chain of command . " Chain of command . " Chain of command 's gonna take two weeks . You like to cut red tape . I get it . But procedures are in place for a reason . You 'd say the same thing . [ Laptop beeping ] I don 't even hold Kill Codes here at the D.O.D. , Glenn . They 're held at the Defense Logistics Building , and I need an Arms Nullification order before I can request them from Undersecretary Thomas . Okay , fine . Red tape it is . [ Keyboard clacking , laptop beeps ] Defense Logistics Building . Did you get that , sir ? Copy that . [ Engine revs up ] [ Tires screech ] The team 's just got to secure that uplink in time . [ Tires screech ] All right , here . This is us . - Now , look , none of this works unless you ... - We 'll get the uplink . Coulson 's just got to get those codes in time . Okay . - You sure this is gonna work ? - Nope . Ahh . Ahh . Many men on the Moon . The ... maaaaah . Aaah . Aaah . Aaah ! Aaah ! - Aaah ! Aaah ! - Stop it . [ Breathes sharply ] Andaz is an inch taller than I am . Undersecretary Thomas , thank you for getting back to us so quickly . General Talbot . General Andaz . Yes , Undersecretary Thomas . I have an Arms Nullification order , and I need you to provide the Kill Codes for ... The code must be provided in person . I have a high-level ATCU agent waiting outside right now . He 's acting under my authority . I 'll need his credentials . Oh , he has them . You bet . Okay . Giyera : Launch sequence has begun , sir . [ Beeping ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Tires screech ] - Undersecretary Thomas ? - Very good . [ Tires screech ] [ Tablet beeping ] We 're in . Uplink 's established . Daisy 's intel panned out . - We got security feeds , too . - Yeah , bonus . Every time I see his face , I want to punch something . [ Laptop beeping ] They 've got us the uplink . Ready , sir . [ Tires screech , gearshift clicks ] Fitz : Did you get it ? Read it out to me . Okay . It 's ... Oh . We are at 20 seconds . Give me the code , sir . Okay , try to keep up . Bravo . 5 . Hotel . 9 . Mike . 1 . Charlie . 1 . 3-4-2-0-0-9 . Sierra . Tango . 1-3-5 . Sierra . Whiskey . 0-1-2-0-0-9 . Come on . Come on . [ Sighs ] [ Beeping continues ] The only thing you gave us that didn 't pan out was that word . You said he mentioned " absolution . " Any idea what he meant ? He thinks he 's the savior . [ Beeping continues ] [ Beeping ] [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] [ Both sigh ] Someone shut us down . That can only be done within the building . S.H.I.E.L.D. Again . Fix this . Bypass this override ! Me ? W-What ... What can I do ? I 'm not a-a flight systems engineer . No , you 're not . So the only thing that 's left to decide is whether to add your mind to my current collection ... or just consume your flesh . No , I-I can handle it . I 'll fix it , I swear . Please , don 't ... do those things . You two , escort Dr. Radcliffe to the missile silo while I show S.H.I.E.L.D. something they haven 't seen from me yet . Rage . Hive : Start searching on the main floor and work your way down . Any S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents you find , bring them to me . Well , Fitz came through . That 's good , right ? Well , we have pissed-off Inhumans and a pissed-off Hive , so good and bad . But , I mean , at least Lash ... at least Andrew didn 't die in vain . The information Daisy brought back has been useful . [ Sighs ] You 're trying to make us feel better . Find meaning in Andrew 's death or what Daisy 's done . - Maybe . - Don 't do that . - They know where we are . - [ Sighs ] I need to move fast , make my way up to the silo and secure the warhead . - Good luck . - You , too . [ Sighing ] Okay . Let 's see ... Your work ... it 's too slow . Well , I 'm sorry we all don 't have superspeed . Oh , this isn 't about superspeed . This is about your turtle speed . You work and then you stare and work and then more staring . - We have to go . - Hurtful . Finish . We have to get the hostages . Well , if this doesn 't work , the hostages won 't matter . Neither will we . 'Cause if Hive gets through here , we 're all dead ... or worse . Would you really use these ? Good . Because I 'd rather die than be anyone 's slave . [ Sighs ] I don 't even know why you 're on this damned mission . It 's too dangerous . [ Bag unzips ] - That 's why you should have this . - What do you think you 're doing ? I 'm giving you your cross back . You need it more than I do . This isn 't a lucky rabbit 's foot . This is a symbol of faith . Who would return such a gift ? Now hurry . We 're running out of time . You walked Mack through the assembly ? Yep , more times than I can count and gave him written directions . And I think it 's out of our hands now . - Taking down Hive 's up to the field team . - They 're not just fighting Hive . There 's a legion of memories inside him . They 're up against every soldier , every genius , every killer he 's ever been . That 's a lot of people to outsmart . - Simmons : Daisy 's awake . - Did she have any more information ? Did she remember what " absolution " means ? - I don 't think she knows . - Maybe it 's buried too deep . We have to keep digging . All right . We don 't have much time , so let 's just jump right in . Obviously , someone has fed a code into the facility 's network , thereby disabling the system . All I have to do is ... bypass it altogether and manually launch the missile . However , that situation would require a rocket scientist or an engineer , and I am neither . Therefore , we 're gonna have to put our heads together and sort this out . [ Sighs ] I 'm gonna call you " Ronald " and you ... " Ronald Two . " Now , as I 'm sure you were both productive , intelligent members of society before you ... became ... you . So , tell me ... have either of you retained any ... any knowledge from your past , any computer skills , engineering , or mechanics ? [ Sighs ] I don 't know if you remember what begging is , but this is exactly that , so please give me something , because I don 't have the tools to ... All right . This is progress . Just keep pushing on . [ Music ] [ Door closes ] I know you 're in here , Lincoln . It 's useless to hide . I think it 's time we had a heart-to-heart , don 't you ? Sorry for taking Daisy from you . Oh , I know that hurt . She told me it would . [ Door slides open ] Fitz entered the Kill Code in time . That 's step one . - And Hive ? - That 's step two . Thank you for the update . I know you 're doing everything you can to try to jog your memory , but when he said absolution ... I told her everything I know . Just like I told him . Once we get an update , so will you . [ Sighs ] You 're a prisoner right now , but that 's temporary . You have to understand ... this ... this is a new situation . - I understand . - The security protocols are in place - to keep everyone safe . - I get it ! No one blames you for this . Then that 's on you , because I deserve the blame ... all of it . And these protocols ? Make them permanent , because I belong in this box . - You 're not a criminal . - That 's exactly what I am . So you can keep your forgiveness and your pity because I shouldn 't have either ... or your friendship . Daisy ... you were brainwashed . So was Ward . [ Chuckles ] We make the perfect pair . Daisy loved you ... at least , she thought she did . You deserve to know that . You have to understand , Lincoln , I gave her something you never could ... happiness . True happiness comes from belonging . That 's something she needs that you could never offer her . Now , deep down , you know this . I made Daisy whole ... and I can do the same for you . We can walk out of this room , find her together . [ Electricity crackling ] You 're never gonna see Daisy again . Oh , go ahead . Destroy this body . It 's well-worn . I 'll just go in someone else . Maybe someone in S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson : Hive didn 't just get in your head ... he changed it on a fundamental level . He altered the chemistry of your brain like a drug . These are the aftereffects . You 're going through withdrawal right now . Is that all you think this is ? - That I 'm dope sick ? - You 're not gonna feel like this forever . I want to . I want to feel this pain until I find Hive . And get revenge ? [ Sighs ] I can 't imagine what you 've been through , but that craving ? I know something about that . You think vengeance is the missing piece of the puzzle , that it will make you whole again , but all it does is break you further . You 're going to get better . - It just takes time ... and distance . - No . I should wake up every morning and feel like this , remembering every drop of blood I spilled . Do you still have the memory machine ? You used it on that Strucker kid . - Daisy , stop . - Put me in it . I bet you 're already thinking about doing that , right , to jog my memory . So bring it in here . Make it my bed and keep every memory , every detail right at the surface , where it belongs . That 's enough . We pulled the memory machine out of storage , but it 's not for you . [ Door slides open ] [ Sighs ] Is it ready yet ? Tell me it 's ready ! I need more time . [ Music ] Go . You guys , go on . Get back ! Run ! I don 't want to have to use this . - You won 't need this . - How did you ... I watch you work slow . I move faster . Your turn . [ Electricity crackling ] Aah ! [ Groaning ] [ Screams ] Simmons : If I ever see you again , I 'll kill you . - This won 't kill me ! - No . But it 'll suck . [ Electricity crackling ] Aaah ! [ Groaning ] Does this mean the plan worked ? - It 's doing something . - The hostages . I know . [ Electricity crackling ] - Closure . - I thought we had a deal . Fitz : I know that you care about us , Ward ! Gideon : I 'm asking you to lead . [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] I can 't hold this much longer . You think we 've done it ... fried his brain ? Let 's not wait around and find out . Come on . Let 's go . [ Groaning ] [ Grunting ] Do you believe I 'm telling you the truth ? Do you believe I 'm ... " Do you believe I 'm telling you the truth ? " Yes . Of course we believe you . - " You have to go . " - Okay . Okay . [ Screams ] Jemma . Jemma ! Jemma , run ! go ! Run ! Run ! Do you think the boss has gone a little gonzo maybe ? Together to the end . Together to the end . Together to the end . Together to the end . To the end . [ Breathing heavily ] We have a connection ... a connection . I want ... I want a connection . Aaah ! Radcliffe : Well , at least you bring strength to the table . That 's never been my forte . Right , listen up . This is called a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface . Grunt along with me ... " Unified ... " [ Door slams open ] On the ground , now ! What the hell did you do to them ? Well , it 's not my finest work , but I was under extreme duress . I want that warhead . Aah ! I 'm here . Mack : Good . You got to hurry . Oh , turtle-man wishes for me to hurry . [ Speaking Spanish ] _ Follow me . Come on ! " There are things about me ... you wouldn 't like me if you knew . " You wouldn 't like me if you knew ... if you knew . - " You wouldn 't like me if you knew . " - Sir ? Focus . Let us help you . " I am not a good man , Skye . " He wanted a connection ... a connection with her . You can 't ever get attached to anyone ... to anyone or anything . You have to fight that weakness in you . Fight that weakness ! You have to fight ... that weakness ... inside of you . - Dude , what the actual hell ? - I need a connection . I want a connection . I want a connection . A connection . To connect , we have to ... disconnect . - We need to disconnect it . - Disconnect what ? Disconnect the warhead ... for absolution . So , you got that ? Do you want to fill a brother in ? " I just wanted to save you . " Save you . [ Echoing ] I gave you a fighting chance to find a way out ... find a way out ... to find a way out , like you always do ... always do . " Like you did . You want me to cross them off ? " [ Growls ] [ Gunshot ] Did S.H.I.E.L.D. send you ? Did they ? - Yes . I 'm with S.H.I.E.L.D. - Oh , thank God . Take me with you . You have to , please ! [ Door slides open ] Oh , no . - Giyera . - He 's taking the warhead . [ Grunts ] Damn ! We have to move ! Come on ! [ Music ] Let 's go , people ! Move , move ! We need to get away from this place now ! Go ! She did good . Look at all these people . Yeah , good thing we brought the very small plane to carry them . We 'll have room . We 're adding another one ! Come on . Come on . Hive : Wait ! [ Breathing heavily ] - What did you do to me ? - The only thing we could think of . [ Device beeping ] - Did ... Did we just ... - Yeah , we did . We caught Hive . [ Chuckles ] Yes ! Whoo ! [ Laughs ] [ Engines rumbling , shouting ] Is everything okay ? What 's going on ? ! Talbot : The hostages are free . We got Hive . Finally , some success . I have to admit ... your sending Inhumans in after him ... I thought that was a stupid gamble . Seriously stupid . Like " betting on WrestleMania " stupid . But you were right . You knew what you were doing . - Congratulations , Coulson . - The mission isn 't a success yet . The warhead 's still in play , laced with a pathogen that could alter humanity as we know it . I 'm well aware of what it 's capable of doing . I 've got a crew running clean-up at the facility right now . I think they 've rounded up a few of those freaks already . I think you mean " victims . " Look , I don 't want one more soul on this planet to end up looking like that . We need to reverse what that monster 's done , and you got to find somebody to help us figure out how . Start with him . He 's the one that turned those people into Inhu ... Primitives . Primitives . I call them " Primitives . " Radcliffe ... Dr. Holden Radcliffe . [ Clears throat ] And I really can 't apologize enough - for what 's happened to those people . - No . You really can 't . But I 'm also a victim here . I was forced to develop that formula . - You better do right by those people . - I can tell by your mustache that you 're a man of importance and not to be trifled with , so I will be absolutely honest with you ... the process is irreversible . And I can tell by your beady little eyes that you 're a worm . So let me be absolutely honest with you . If you don 't find a solution to this problem , you 're gonna end up looking like one of those mouth-breathers you made . - You understand ? - How could I not ? Almost as scary as Hive , that one . [ Sighs ] Remember us ? Coulson : Fitz and Simmons are working with Dr. Radcliffe on a way to counter the effects of Hive 's formula , but that 's a long shot . The threat has to be neutralized before it comes close to detonating . We need to find Hive 's base of operations and get the jump on his people . [ Grunts ] Mack : They might make our search easier for us . As long as we have Hive , they 're gonna come for him . We 'll be ready . I want everyone on high alert and the base sealed off . That includes the hangar door . Yeah , parts for its hydraulics finally came in . - Already got a team on it . - What can I do , sir ? You 've done enough . Mack filled me in on your performance . - Well done . - I just want this to be over . Remember , I told you ... I decide if you get to be a part of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? I think you 'd make a great agent . You also said that I had to want it . I don 't think that I do . You got a lot of good people on this team ... real heroes . That 's not me . Once we 're done with Hive , - I 'm done with all of it , I think . - Just like that ? Wha ... I mean , what are you gonna do ? I don 't know , Mack . Trying to figure that out . - See the world . - I think that 's a mistake , Lincoln . You have a future here at S.H.I.E.L.D. What about Daisy ? There 's nothing I have to offer Daisy that she wants or needs . - I know that now . - Is anyone gonna talk to her ... at least let her know we have Hive ? That 's not a great idea right now . We need to stick to the security protocols . You got to be kidding me . - Should we stop him ? - I don 't think we can . We got him . - Hive . - Mhm . Safe , sound , and catatonic in a Gel-Matrix chamber . I thought you 'd want to know . [ Exhales ] Thanks . But you should be in the module . The protocols are for your own safety . You think I give a damn about security protocols ? You 're my partner . [ Music ] We 're not partners anymore . So just leave . You remember what happened last time . Yeah . And I forgive you . I didn 't ask for that . That 's too bad . I forgive you . [ Sighs ] No , don 't be stupid . Get away , okay ? - Um , just get ... get ... - It 's okay , Daisy . It 's okay . Get away . Get ... Get ... Get away ! - Daisy , it 's okay . - No ! Mnh ! [ Crying ] I don 't deserve this . [ Sobbing ] [ Sighs ] I 've only scratched the surface of the thumb drive that Radcliffe gave us , and I can already see that he was in way over his head . His enhancements rely on technology . These changes are pure bio . The Parasite in his formula actually attaches itself to strands of DNA . - We 'll find a cure . - Possibly , in a decade or so . - What are you working on ? - Oh , nothing . Just browsing some ... things . [ Chuckles ] You 're a terrible liar . [ Monitor beeps ] Well ... it was supposed to be a surprise . - Booking a trip ? - For two . That 's a romantic gesture . How very ... not you ... to be romantic . What ? Of cou ... That is ridiculous . We both know that I 'm the romantic one . [ Sighs ] But it might not be the best time to be skipping off to the ... [ Beeping ] ... Seychelles ? - Does look nice . - Hive 's in custody , S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to recover that warhead , and then I was thinking that ... We 've had enough tragedy . A little fun wouldn 't kill us . You think I 'm not romantic ? I 'm gonna do something with you on that island that will take your breath away . What is ... Are you ? - Are you ? Are you ? Wha ? - Snorkeling . Did you know there are over 1,000 species of fish in the Seychelles ? [ Laughs ] I cannot wait . [ Monitor beeping ] Everything all right ? Yeah . I need to go inspect the Gel-Matrix chamber and sign off before they can bring Hive into the base . [ Music ] - Is this yours ? - No . I think it 's Yo-Yo 's . All right . I 'll give it to her . You 're a man of faith . You know I am . So what was it like ... coming face-to-face with the devil ? Hive ? Well , he 's evil , scary as all hell , - but I don 't think he 's the devil . - You don 't get it . When Hive takes over a body , he steals that person 's memories . That 's as close to stealing a soul as you can get . " Memory is the scribe of the soul . " - The Bible ? - Aristotle . [ Chuckle ] What ? I have dimensions . [ Chuckles ] Look , Tremors , I 've had my mind controlled . No , this ... wasn 't that . The worst part about Hive is , when he 's making you hurt the people you care about , he makes you love him for it . If Hive isn 't the devil , he 's the closest thing to it you and I will ever see . It 's not safe . - If he got out , he ... - He 's not getting out . He can 't be contained . He has to be destroyed . [ Grunts ] You know ... another thing the devil is capable of ? Filling a person with ... so much anger and so many dark thoughts that it consumes them . [ Music ] But it 's up to that individual to make a choice ... either let the darkness fester and grow or ... let the light inside shine through and vanquish the darkness . - This isn 't about revenge . - Hey . We 're safe . Coulson 's sealing up the base . [ Machinery whirring ] [ Metal thuds ] [ Tablet beeping ] Gel 's stable . Power 's strong enough for transport . Um , make sure you reconnect that once it 's inside and secure . You got it . When 's the bloody hangar door gonna get closed , O 'Brien ? We 've got engineers on it . We had to wait a few days . Parts were delayed . [ Tablet beeps ] _ O 'Brien ! Wait ! [ Coughing ] [ Grunts ] [ Snarls ] [ Roars ] [ Alarm blaring ] What is it ? What 's happening ? Jemma , there was an explosion in the hangar . Fitz . Okay . What do we do ? [ Growling ] Let 's get out of here ! Aah ! [ Screaming ] No ! No , no , no , no ! The lockdown . - Hey ! Hey , help ! - They 're trapped inside . - Can we override the doors ? - We put everything on lockdown . By the time we override , Fitz will be ... [ Tablet beeps ] Fitz , do you read ? Yeah ! Sir , I 'm in a bit of trouble ! We know . We 're gonna get you out of there . [ Panting ] [ Growls ] No , no , no , no ! Stay away from them ! Stay away from the gas ! We have to get out of the hangar ! [ Men screaming ] No , no , no . There 's nothing you can do for them . We have to get back out to the base . [ Screaming continues ] Hey ! How are you doing in there ? ! Fitz , it 's the lockdown . We can 't ... The motion sensors ! You have to get them working again . [ Growling ] [ Tasers firing ] If we isolate them from the system , can we get around the lockdown ? Yes ! You can fry the bridging , which connects the sensor system to the security protocol ! I can do that . No , the server system is on the other side of the base . It won 't work . Well , we need to do something fast . Fitz ... Professor Vaughn 's Third Year Compiler Theory ? Fitz : Yeah ! Yeah ! Do that ! Fast , please ! I 'm not an engineer . I hope I can re-create what you did there . No , no , no ! You saw me do it ! You have a good memory ! I mean , you do , right ? [ Weapons firing ] Hey , it 's open ! It 's open ! [ Grunts ] [ Screaming ] [ Panel beeps ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Panting ] Thank you , Jemma . [ Sighs ] What the hell is Professor Vaughn 's Third Year Compiler Theory ? It 's complicated . [ Growls ] [ All grunting ] Well , that 's not good . - If Hive gets out of stasis ... - It 's not an " if . " No . It 's not . At least we sealed off the hangar . But there are S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel in there . They 're gone . We have to cut our losses . It 's all we can do . [ Music ] I can 't believe this is happening . [ Alarm blaring ] Mack : He wants a way out . - No ... - What ? Daisy , what is it ? I told him everything . Yeah , we know that , but what does that have to do ... No , Mack , I told him everything , including the plans to the Zephyr . And the fact that it has high-altitude capabilities . Hive has his delivery system now . [ Panel beeping ] [ Footsteps approaching ] - Daisy . - She 's safe in her cell . - Which is where you two should be . - Not a chance . You can put the vests on us , but we fight . We don 't have time for this ! Daisy said Hive knows everything the Zephyr 's capable of . - If he gets his hands on it ... - That 's his new missile . And we brought him right to it . [ Sighs ] Mack : He still looks shaky . Maybe he won 't remember how to fly it . May : That 's a thin hope to hang onto . Coulson : We can 't let Hive get control of that ship . [ Panel beeping ] - We need to get someone in there . - I can 't ask anyone to do that . I can go in . The gas won 't change me . No , but it can sway you . I won 't let what happened to Daisy happen to anyone else . Take a breath . You don 't need to think of the whole solution . Just ... Just part of it . Right ? [ Door slides open ] - Pieces solving ... a puzzle . - Hey . Sorry . Having trouble . My memories . You were in that one ... . Do you have any idea ... what you did to me ? Yes . I remember . You 're in pain . [ Music ] Please ... [ Breathes shakily ] ... take me back .

 ( GRUNTING ) LUCY : Previously on Killjoys . .. BELLUS : May I present Delle Seyah Kendry , of Land Kendry . I want to say thank you . For ? Saving my ass on that ship . DUTCH : I took that jump for all of us . Fine . Thank you for all of us . Dr. lllenore Pawter Simms , you 're under arrest . Johnny , I need you to figure out a way to track Khlyen down with this . DUTCH : What the hell is that ? KHYLEN : A neuro-link . We 'll be able to hear and see each other as if we 're in the same room . The army doctor you 've been looking for . Dr. Jaegar , yeah . PAWTER : If Jaegar passed through there , I can probably help you find her . Do you remember having any surgery at all ? No . PAVVTER : At least now we know you don 't have traumatic amnesia . Someone doesn 't want you to remember . I got something ! What is it ? I 'm not sure yet . It 's a ghost image I extracted from the neuro-link that Khlyen put on you . You recognize it ? I don 't know . It 's hard to tell . Yeah . Well , it 's definitely indoors . JOHN : Why is that ? Isn 't that a window ? Where ? There in the corner . Lucy ? Upper right corner of image . Clear the noise and increase magnification as much as you can . That 's him , isn 't it ? That 's Khlyen 's reflection . So , this is a recording from his end of the link . I think we 're looking at the last thing that he saw before you broke your connection . Almost got you , you bastard . ( DEVICE POWERS DOWN ) What happened ? I don 't know . Well , fix it . Make it come back . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm trying . Because if we can get more images from this thing , maybe we can figure out where Khlyen is . Yes , I 'm aware . Yeah , Dutch , let 's get some air . Let Johnny work . I hope you didn 't drag me out here to talk about my feelings . Well , that 's not really either of our style , now , is it ? Autotargets ? Why shoot the shit when you can shoot at shit ? 30 Joys says I can kick your fine ass . Count to three . You 're on , pretty boy . One . Two . JOHN : Well , Shit . I can 't fix this thing if I don 't even know how it works . Lucy , if I engage with the device , can you scan me , figure out how it works so we can go from there ? LUCY : I cannot recommend using an object which we do not yet fully understand , John . Yeah . Said no good scientist , ever . Okay . Here goes something . Winged it ! Tie . I don 't believe in ties . That 's just quitting before you win . Feeling better ? Much . Good . Now we can talk about your feelings . Ass . Why are you so desperate for Johnny to find Khlyen ? ( SIGHS ) Because I want answers . He 's holding pieces of me hostage . Truths about my life I can 't get from anywhere else . Good or bad , I just want to know my own story . See ? You think that 's stupid . No , that 's exactly why I need to find Dr. Jaegar . I get it . You know , you 're pretty good with words for a badass . JOHN ON RADIO : Guys ! A little help ? John . Get it off ! Get it off ! ( GROANING ) Johnny , you big idiot . What were you thinking ? I was trying to figure out how it works , so I can fix it . But in my defense , in scientific research , there 's a very thin line between stupid and genius . Well , congratulations , you crossed it . Can you see anything ? No , no . It must not be turned on , on Khlyen 's end . All I 'm getting is a headache . Okay . ( GROANS ) Don 't touch it . This ... This thing is my only shot at finding Khlyen . We can 't risk damaging it . Or me , right ? Lucy , take us home . Why ? We 've got to get you to Pawter . She can extract it properly . Oh , man , surgery ? Like I always tell you . Science , it 's dumb . ( SINGING ) Come , come , come uninvited Run , run , run till I find you I don 't care which side that you 're fighting Gonna get you gone PAWTER : Hope I don 't still smell like Westhole . Hills threw me in jail last night . Hills arrested you ? For what ? I may have possibly stolen his ID code so I could look for your Dr. Jaegar in the Company records . You said you had a connection . I lied . So , did you find her or not ? PAWTER : Close . JOHN : ( GROANS ) Easy , Paw . Stop whining . Yeah , well , stop digging at my brain shaft . I think I found a former patient of hers . A guy named Grayson Hicks . Filed complaints against a doctor that left him with your exact issues . D 'AVIN : Oh , Gross . ( GROANS ) Whoops . I hope you didn 't need this . ( PANTING ) Shit , Dutch , I broke it . I 'm sorry . Okay , I screwed up . I get that you 're angry . I 'm not angry , John . Okay , yes , I 'm pissed . But mostly , I 'm scared . Of Khlyen ? Of losing my one chance to get the upper hand and face him on my own terms . That was my only shot at taking him down . I 'll find a way to fix this . Okay ? I promise . D 'AVIN : So ... About this Grayson guy ... I left you messages . From jail . I 'm sorry , I ... I thought they were personal calls . And that makes it okay to ignore them ? Oh , I get it . You were pulling a fade . Didn 't have the courtesy to break up to my face . ( SCOFFS ) Break up ? This was never an official relationship . You 're officially an asshole . And you 've been nailing your patient while treating him for mental trauma . So , maybe I don 't get all the blame here . Maybe you don 't . Look . Pawter . I 'm a mess right now , and ... Oh , please , don 't . Spare me the broken-boy speech . I know it by heart by now . I 'll give you Grayson 's location . I hope your team can use him to find Jaegar . Where is he ? Somewhere I sincerely hope you don 't end up . ( ALARM BLARING ) JOHN : I told them if we dug any deeper this would happen , but did they believe me ? No . Now , the whole damn building is out . Look , I 'm getting overtime on this . No , screw Charlie ! Union rules . Hey , where 's your tech room ? Excuse me ? Your room of tech ? I 'm not sure how else to say it . You can 't come in here without a pass . ( SCOFFS ) Well , I can 't fix it from out here , unless you have some workaround for basic physics . Do you ? Fine . Just sign this damn denial of service and let me get on with my night . Right here . Wait for it . And there . ( GASPING ) ( WHISTLES ) ( GASPS ) DUTCH : Are you Grayson ? Are you real ? It 's okay , you 're not hallucinating . Why are you in my room ? I think the doctor who messed you up did the same thing to me . Do you remember where she treated you ? That bitch is the one thing that I can 't forget . DUTCH : How do we find her ? I 'll take you right to her . As long as you take me with you . ( BEEPS ) Johnny , we 're go for Plan B. JOHN : Where to ? No way . You can get us in there ? Because I 've always wanted to geek out with the tech-pirates , but it 's invite only . GRAYSON " . You 're invited . But you can 't go in there dressed like normies and smelling like cops . D 'AVIN : Why is everyone looking at me ? I can be cool . JOHN : Best undercover ever ! Except for D 'av . You 're just jealous because I make this work . JOHN : Welcome to Utopia . What the hell is this place ? A club or a market ? Yes and yes . Sex , drugs , meds , and tech . Everything illegal and freaky in the Quad is for sale in Utopia . D 'AVIN : So the doctor deals here ? GRAYSON : Yeah , we all call her Dr. Bliss . She sells a memory-mod treatment . Really badass stuff . You guys wait here , and I 'll go see if the doctor 's still selling here . I , um ... I 'm going to go check a few things out while we wait . It 's super nerdy . You guys would be bored . Yeah , fine . Go . We 'll be here . Weirdo . Follow me , leather boy . Mood mods ? Ten-minute samples , first hit 's free . Euphoria in a bottle . No , thanks . I 'm good . Wait . Ten minutes ? Mmm-hmm . What the hell . I 'm not supposed to be myself tonight . What 's gotten into you ? You 're the one who put me in leather . JOHN : You Carleen ? Almost done here . What do you need ? I hear you 're the woman to talk to when it comes to fringe biotech . You ever seen one of these ? Keep it clean , come back in a week . Aren 't you a sexy bitch ? What is she ? It 's a neural interface of some kind . It 's busted . Can you fix it ? DUTCH : Slow down , sailor . You 're not nervous , are you ? What you said this morning ? About Khlyen having your missing pieces ? Jaegar having mine ? What about it ? All this time we 've spent finding them . What if we don 't like what they have to say ? What do you want her to say ? That it 's not my fault . You 're pretty . I take it it 's working , then . What are you doing ? I found her . She 's working in the back . Um ... Do you guys ... Do you need a minute ? We 're going to need about eight . Okay . This is grade A mechorganic shit you have here . What is that ? New kind of biotech hybrid . Living technology . Look here . This is a fragment of actual neural cortex . That liquid 's probably cerebrospinal fluid . All connected with chips and gears . It 's amazing . So you have seen this before . Honey , no one in the Quads seen this before . She is a long way from home . I have a connection who can maybe help . But ? If I get her fixed , once you 're done with her , she 's all mine . Deal ? DUTCH : Johnny , get to the back room - Grayson found his doctor . Well , I guess I don 't have a choice . We need to talk . It will be a short conversation . That 's not her . Too young to be Jaegar . But you know that name . Dr. Jaegar . Mmm ... No , but I do know that you need to leave . So ... And I know that you need my permission to keep breathing . Oh ! Dr. Jaegar . There we go . What 's your connection ? We know you used her treatment on Grayson . I was her assistant , when the Company first brought her over to the Quad . Not a good fit ? ( SNIFFS ) Well , she had no vision . She was a total corporate whore . I told her there 's a huge consumer need for this type of service . We could have cornered the market . But , oh , no , she wanted to dance with the ones that brought her . D 'AVIN : So she stayed with the Company and you stole her technique . No . I improved it . Jaegar just removed memories , I implant them . Ask Grayson . You want to know what it feels like to basejump or ... Or kill someone . I can source that for you , baby . JOHN : So where is she now ? Well , we don 't exactly exchange birthday cards . Sorry . I guess you 're shit out of luck . Hmm ... Looky here . All your specs on Jaegar 's technique . You don 't mind if we borrow this , do you ? Little bit . Yeah . Kind of need that . Well , karma called . And she said , " Suck it . " You stole from Jaegar . Now we steal it from you . LUCY : Approaching Westerley . D 'AVIN : Appreciate the initiative , Johnny , but what the hell are we supposed to do with this ? Give it to Pawter . See what she says . Yeah . She probably doesn 't want to talk to me right now . John , you ask her . Everybody likes you . JOHN : It 's not my fault I 'm charming . GUARD : You three . ID . ( SIGHS ) RAC agents . Hey ! What 's your problem ? Drop your weapons . On the ground , now . Do it ! Boys . Stand down . What 's the charge ? Kidnapping a patient from a Company facility . Grayson ? That 's bullshit . We 're on an official mission . Yeah ? Show me your warrant , smart guy . Got the team leader . I 'm bringing her in . ( SIGHS ) Hello , Yalena . How do you know that name ? Oh , I know a lot of interesting things about you now . I 'm a curious woman . And a bit of a stalker . Or am I supposed to believe you being here is a coincidence ? I may have possibly put a little alert on your name in the Company system . So , I wouldn 't miss an opportunity like this . I do so love rescuing a damsel in distress . What do you want , Seyah ? A little trade , just between us girls . My company will drop all charges against you and your team in exchange for a future favor of my choosing . You can just hire me . Strictly off the books . No questions , no hesitation , no warrant on record . I snap , and you come . You must be one hell of a snapper . Okay , I 'll play . But it 's going to cost you a bit more . I 'm looking for a doctor who works for the Company . I want 24 hours alone with her . No security , no repercussions . Or no deal . How bad do you want me ? JOHN : You can 't just make a deal like that without talking to us . DUTCH : It got us here , didn 't it ? I can 't believe she 's been on VVesterley this whole time . Well , it 's a big moon . You ready ? For real , this time ? DR. JAEGAR : What do you mean , security left their stations ? Who pulled them ? MAN : I 'm trying to find out . That would be us . Favor from a friend , so we could talk uninterrupted . Is that her ? That 's her . Do you remember me ? I do . You 're a long way from home , soldier . I 've been looking for you up and down the J. Well , you found me . Sit , sit . How was the treatment ? I know I butchered my people . And I know the army went in and took back the memories before I was discharged . That was you . You shouldn 't have any memory of that at all . D 'AVIN : What else ? What else did you people do to me ? Nothing . You asked us to take the memories . After what you did to your squad . But Why did I kill them ? That 's the part I can 't remember . Was it an experiment , a test ? Was I on something ? I can 't rewrite history for you , son . I 'm sorry . You killed them because you had a psychotic break in the line of duty . Then the army did what it always does . Covered it up . Bullshit . There has to be a reason . There has to be more of a reason . Okay . Okay . Enough . Can you at least finish the job ? Get rid of the residual memories ? They 're torturing him . Gladly . The technique has come a long way . You can get back in the machine anytime you want . Yeah , I don 't know about that . D 'AVIN : Can you give me back my memories ? Can you reverse the treatment ? Theoretically , but why would you do that to yourself ? Can we do it now ? DUTCH : Whoa . Slow down . Dutch . D 'avin . It 's the only way I 'll ever understand . You need to think about this . And that 's an order . D 'av , she 's not wrong . We at least need to talk about this . Look , I appreciate your concern , but it 's none of your business . Bullshit . We 're a team . It 's very much our business whether you let someone go digging in your damn brain . ( SIGHS ) When he gets like this , you 've just got to give him some space . He 'll come around . ( COMMUNICATOR BEEPING ) I 've got to go take care of something . We 'll try again when I get back . Okay ? JOHN : Carleen ? I 'm on my way . DR. JAEGAR : Hurry it up . ASSISTANT : I can 't find the files . Move . I know what you 're doing . Getting those memories back isn 't about moving on , it 's about punishing yourself for what you did . But try seeing the one positive in this amnesia . I mean , do you have any idea what I 'd give to forget some of the things I 've done ? Yeah , that 's not the same thing , Dutch . You killed in the line of duty . I murdered my men . Let 's not compare sins here , okay ? I 'll win . You don 't understand . Neither do you . The first time I killed someone , I was eight years old . How ? Poisoned tea . No , I mean ... How does that even happen ? It doesn 't matter . Dutch , it matters . Khlyen ? You said he was your tutor . Yeah , that 's what he taught me . Killing . I 'm not judging you right now because I don 't have any right to . So , whatever you 've done , I promise you , I have done worse . If you can 't be forgiven , then what chance is there for me ? I 'm sorry . JOHN : Okay , I know it 's been a rough couple of days , but I finally got some good news . I fixed Khlyen 's device , so I splurged on a bottle of 10-Joy Hokk to celebrate . So , come get some ! Guess you 're already getting some . ASSISTANT : Are you sure you want to do this ? You know , if we do this again , we 're going to need a bigger bed . I 'll speak to the owner . We are awesome at the whole sex thing , by the way . Are you naked high-fiving me right now ? ( CHUCKLES ) So who 's going to say it ? What ? That this doesn 't have to change anything . Is that an order ? Or a decree ? You know , you never did explain that whole royal-harem thing . What about it ? I just want to know if I 'm bedding a warrior princess . Actually , yes . But that was all through my marriage . You 're married ? Widowed . Sorry . I didn 't mean to get personal . I think we got plenty personal today . No , it 's ... It 's fine . I just don 't want Johnny coming back and finding us together . Oh , shit . Johnny . You know he 's going to say we can 't handle this . We can , though . Right ? Tap my heart . You look good in my things , by the way . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , shut up . ( SIGHS ) Lucy , when did Johnny get back ? LUCY : He boarded eight minutes , 29 seconds ago . He exited two minutes , 10 seconds later . Shit . ( GROANING ) Don 't bother getting dressed . We 're already ... Busted . D 'avin ? D 'avin ! What are you doing ? D 'avin , stop ! ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANS ) DUTCH : John , come in ! D 'avin , what are you doing ? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) LUCY : John has disengaged his com . I will keep trying him . D 'avin , it 's me ! ( GRUNTS ) ( GASPING ) ( GROANS ) Troubles ? I may have hypothetically walked in on Dutch and my brother , how they say , " ln flagrant dictation . " " ln flagrante delicto . " Whatever . You 're jealous . Finally ! Excuse me ? No , don 't blame D 'avin for climbing the tree , when all you were going to do was sit by it . Whoa . You are way off . This is not ... This is ... Dutch is family . This is not jealousy . It 's like , um ... It 's like my brother is banging my sister . Yeah , okay . Okay , okay . Dude , I see your point . Still , we all knew they were heading there . Might as well get it over with . Yeah , and then what ? It 's kind of hard to have casual sex with someone you live with , and they 're both ... I mean , they are both terrible at relationships . I mean , epically incompetent . So , whatever this is , it can 't last . And they know that it can 't last . And then , I have to pick a side . You 'll pick hers . I will . That make me a bad brother ? Makes you an excellent friend . I 'm guessing she 's earned that from you . It 's just that Dutch has drawn a bunch of short straws when it comes to guys . And I just ... ( SIGHS ) I don 't want my brother being on that list . Sweetie . I wouldn 't worry . This is Dutch we 're talking about . Not a lot he can do to hurt our girl . Lucy , cut the lights in cargo bay . LUCY : Shutting down now . ( PANTING ) I know you 're down here . DUTCH : I don 't want to hurt you . Well , I need to hurt you . Why ? I have my mission . I 'm a good soldier . Well , I 'm a better one . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) What happened ? Your brother . What about him ? What 's ... What 's wrong ? He just ... He just changed . He ... He went off on me . Like someone pulled a switch . Johnny , he tried to kill me . ( SNICKERS ) D 'avin ? Come on . John . No , no , no , no , no . He wouldn 't do that . He turned on me like ... Like he turned on his squad , hours after finding Jaegar . Do you think that 's a coincidence ? She did this . I know she did . She 's ... She 's controlling him somehow . Okay . Okay , okay . What ... What do we need to do ? I 'm going back to Jaegar . She 's going to fix this or I 'm going to break her , a piece at a time . You stay here . Watch your brother . He 's ... He 's in the cargo hold . Be careful . ( DOOR OPENS ) Hi , Johnny . ( GRUNTS ) What the hell did you do to her ? DR. JAEGAR : Just pack the essentials . Was it something we said ? Guessing you didn 't expect to see any of us alive again . Whoa . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) No , but I prepared for it just in case . ( GROANS ) Johnny , I need help with a security field . Johnny ? DR. JAEGAR : It 's a black zone . No outside communication . Make yourself comfortable . We 'll be gone soon . Why ? ( CLAPPING ) Hey ! You need to shake this off , D 'av . I know the real you is still in there . You remember that last winter at Kipsey ? That fat kid , Randy , huh ? The one who always stole our skates ? Boy , we hated him . But you still risked your ass for his when he fell through the ice . You just went in right in after him . That was the scariest five minutes of my life , waiting for you to come back . That is who you are . You do the right thing better than anyone I know . And you always come back . Okay , so we 're going to fix you . Dutch is with Jaegar right now . She 's working on it . Thank you . ( GRUNTING ) ( STABS ) ( GROANS ) ( WHIMPERING ) I 'm a good soldier . ( GROANING ) ( GASPING ) D 'av . So , I think I figured out what you really did to D 'avin . And what exactly is that ? Turned him into some kind of human weapon you could target at whoever you want . That 's a simplistic description , but you seem a simplistic woman . I 'm not the one with the flawed technique . You 're not as good as you think you are , or else he never would have remembered . Perfection is a process . Our mandate was to turn soldiers against their own forces . And I assure you , we succeeded . If it makes you feel any better , it was only meant to be a proof of concept demonstration , no casualties . Yeah ? What went wrong ? We underestimated your friend 's determination to kill . Cost me my job . Your soldier friend almost tracked me down once before , on our home world . My deal with the Company included placing a kill warrant on him in case he followed me to the Quad . That was you ? And now , they 've let me hang out to dry . I have to say , you have some very impressive connections . I may not be a genius , Doc , but I can count to three . One , two ... Three . Lucy , get me a doctor . LUCY : I need more specifics , John . John ? John . I don 't know what to do . You should know my work is important . You have no idea what 's coming to the Quad , what it could mean for all of us . Here 's what I know . You hurt my friend . He hurt me . And now , I 'm going to hurt you . So that you can 't do this to him or anyone else again . He 's here . Outside . Turn him off . Now . Now why would I do that ? He 's programmed to kill his team . He 's no threat to me . I am . Shut him down . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) ( BEEPS ) ( GROANING ) Are you all right ? What 's happening ? Dutch ? DUTCH : Show me your eyes . Just finishing something . Hang tight . What happens now ? We both know I can 't leave you like this . He 'll never be safe again . You know how to run that thing ? I 'm going to give you something you never gave D 'avin . A choice . The gun or the memory-wipe procedure . The gun . Procedure it is . Strap her in . Take her memories . All of them . ( SIGHS ) LUCY : Identify yourself . Pawter . You called . LUCY : You are required in cargo hold . Lucy , what 's his blood type ? LUCY : John Andras Jaqobis is blood type O. Put me through to the nearest Company med ship . MAN : This is med ship Avignon . Come in . Avignon , this is an all-request emergency evac to my location , medical authorization number Five-Four-Alpha-Nine . Priority code Angel . That means , get your asses here now ! MAN : I 'm sorry , Doctor , med ships aren 't approved for your sector . This is lllenore Seyah Simms of Land Simms . And if you ignore my call , I will have you staked in the rain . We are en route , Seyah . You bet your ass you are . Hang in there , Johnny . How 's D 'avin ? Maybe , for once , just worry about yourself first . We 're all fine . Dutch . You tell him that we know that it wasn 't his fault . He needs to rest . Thank you . Rest . He 'll take a while to fully heal , but he 's going to be okay . He was asking for you . Yeah ? I should probably let him rest . Maybe tomorrow . I destroyed all of Jaegar 's research and equipment . I don 't care about that right now . How are you even looking at me ? Do you remember much of it ? Dutch , I remember everything . Please tell me you know I would never do anything to hurt you or John . Please tell me you know that that wasn 't really me . I do . Of course I do . But it was me . I can 't be okay with that .

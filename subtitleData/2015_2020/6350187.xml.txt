 Previously on " marvel 's agents of s.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Fitz ! You 're safe . That portal won 't open again . But it has to . I have to go back . I 'm on my third hand . May took off on vacation and never came back , So I lost my right hand , too . Things keep coming at us . New inhumans , the atcu , and this new guy . You should have seen him . It was a whole new level . Do you even know who the hell I am ? Ward : You 're werner von strucker . Your father was one of hydra 's greatest leaders . Hydra 's fractured . We 're gonna rebuild it . Man : Dr. Garner ? Yeah . I was hoping to add your class . I plan to put ward six feet underground . What 's your way in ? From below . Climb the ranks . [ indistinct shouting ] You certainly don 't make it easy to get a meeting . The boss doesn 't want it to be easy . But he 's always interested in meeting people Who can prove themselves . ¶ ¶ I can 't tell . I can 't tell just by looking at it . Can you ? Nobody can . It 's chicken . [ sighs ] I think I 'm gonna have to cut into it . There 's nothing worse than dry chicken . Yep . I got you . Here . [ knock on door ] Are you expecting someone ? ¶ ¶ [ chuckles ] no way . Alisha , what are you doing here ? Hey . Sorry to drop by like this , but it 's important . The terrigen got out . When we saw lincoln in the news And all that stuff about a government task force ... We knew it was bad . We just didn 't know how bad . The world sees us as a threat . We need to stick together - - Those of us who 've been here since before the outbreak . Wait , are you the one Who sent us that weird e-mail the other day ? What e-mail ? The one about finding the rest of our people , Bringing them back together . No . Can you show it to me ? [ thud ] No ! [ grunting ] [ electricity crackling ] [ screaming ] [ gasping ] Alisha , talk to me . What 's happening ? She 's dead . He killed her . It 's here . Daisy , mack , move in now ! [ screams ] Something 's attacking ! Alisha 's down ! [ gasps ] No . Sir , we 've got three dead . We 're gonna need backup . Looks like the killer 's on the - - Daisy , wait ! Daisy ! Damn it . Coulson : Alisha ! Alisha , can you hear me ? ! He 's here . He 's here to kill us . And you can 't stop him . Bobbi : I assure you , We 're looking for the suspects right now . Please just go back into your apartments and lock your doors . Thank you for your cooperation . Detective . [ indistinct conversations ] Think they bought it ? Don 't know . The old lady 's a trickster - - Had her hand on one of those 911 red-alert necklaces . We don 't have much time Before the official authorities get here . Gather whatever you can find before we lose the scene . I thought this was just supposed to be a recruiting mission . It was . I don 't know where this attack came from . Is alisha gonna be okay ? She felt it happen - - went into shock . Med team 's evac-ing her to containment now . Before the attack , She said something about the couple getting an e-mail . Fitz ? Laptop . On it . What about daisy and mack ? They could use backup out there . I know you really want to get back into action , agent morse , But the answer 's no . You 're still rehabbing . You haven 't passed the physical . Understood , sir . Daisy , what 's your location ? [ static ] daisy , do you copy ? You 're cutting in and out , sir . We 've trailed the killer to the industrial park A half a mile south of you . Backup would be nice . Coulson : On its way . Hold tight . Copy that . How did I let you talk me into this ? I had a garage , workbench full of new tools , My own espresso machine . We got to figure out how this thing is finding inhumans And why it 's killing them . I know why . Yeah ? Why ? Instinct . It 's like a great white shark , built to eat , sleep - - And kill . I was gonna say " make little baby sharks , " But then " jaws " was probably 20 years before you were born , So ... [ door slams ] Do we have movement ? I don 't know . I can 't see a damn thing . Well , do you want me to take point ? I 'm going . I 'm going . Hmm . Found something . Could be from our monster . Oh , blue . Not clear . What ? I said , " blue . Not clear . " How many times am I - - Okay , look , simmons and I have created a system . " b " is for " blue " is for " biological sample . " Right , another system . How could I forget ? [ tapping ] just saying - - where I come from , blue is for recycle . Well , that is insane . " r " I could understand - - " r " is for " red " is - - Regardless , we could use simmons ' eyes on these samples . [ grunts ] think she 'd be up for that ? Uh , I don 't know . Heard you guys had dinner . Mm-hmm . She open up to you at all about what happened to her ? Not really . Why ? Did she say something to you ? No . [ helicopter blades whirring ] Helicopters . We need to move . Oh , it 's got to be long gone . I mean , something that big can 't just slip away without - - [ thud ] Damn it . I had to jinx it , didn 't I ? Sounds like something 's trying to get out . Or in . Come on . Three Two ... [ guns cocking ] put the weapons down ! Get down ! Put it down ! Put it down ! Put your weapons down ! Lower your weapons ! Rosalind : Stand down ! Everybody , stand down ! S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s not the enemy , And you definitely don 't want to piss off The young agent johnson here . We 've got about 19 agent johnsons on our side , Though none that can take down a building . Rosalind price , by the way . Coulson ? It 's okay . The atcu is here to help . Really ? 'cause , the other day , They wanted daisy 's head for their trophy case . Agent mackenzie . Rosalind : Bit of an exaggeration . But that was then , and this is now . And right now , we 're here to contain a threat , same as you . Fan out . I get that you cut a deal with them , but for the record - - It 's a means to an end . Ours or theirs ? ¶ ¶ Bag everything - - computers , clothes , phones , Anything they 've touched . Where are you taking the victims ? That 's classified . Oh . It 's not fun when it 's you , right ? Can 't believe I just said that to the director of s.H.I.E.L.D. You know , I 'm really not feeling the spirit of cooperation here . You know , we had an agreement . You were supposed to share intel . And I did , ' cause , look - - you 're here . How did you find them , coulson ? And why wasn 't I informed ? You were informed as soon as we engaged the hostile . I 'm talking about before you got here . This is the first time I 've encountered a couple like this . How so ? This wasn 't the usual response call To deal with somebody who just turned . Look around . No cocoons . Maybe it didn 't happen here . Shane and lori hanson - - They lived here for the last 18 months , And yet never visited an emergency room , Never missed time at work , Didn 't socialize with co-workers , Had zero presence online . So they were introverts . They were already enhanced before the outbreak . So I will ask you again , in the spirit of cooperation How did you find them , coulson ? They were friends of a friend . You mean daisy 's friends . Look , we can do this all day , But there 's an enhanced person out there killing people , And I 'd really like to catch him . Are you gonna help or not ? I like when you get all tough . All right , we 'll take it from here . I 'll call if I find anything . [ breathes deeply ] You 're welcome , by the way . Oh , don 't take it personally , phil . I 'm sure you have other evildoers out there to catch . Nice haul . New recruit brought you these ? Yeah . Same bloke who brought these took out spud last week . He 's a tough bastard . I like that he didn 't come empty-handed . Hmm . Might be helpful on the next job , whatever that is . [ gun cocks ] sorry , kebo . That 's level seven . Level seven . Right . I 'm messing with you . It was a s.H.I.E.L.D. Thing - - One of their ridiculous codes of bureaucracy , Though I will say there are a few things That s.H.I.E.L.D. Got right - - things they valued . And I don 't mean money or power or resources . Now , take this job , for instance . It 's all about accountability , patience , An attention to detail that requires a ... Personal touch . Those kinds of things mattered at s.H.I.E.L.D. [ grunts ] [ thud ] Almost a shame we 're gonna bring it all down . May : So , what 's the job ? Don 't know . When 's it going down ? Don 't know . Any idea where ? Not yet . You do realize the point of intelligence gathering Is to gather intelligence ? The point is , I 'm moving up the food chain . And that lunatic kebo is finally bringing me in on a job . Or luring you into a trap . We have to be smart about this . It 's not complicated , really . Just point , shoot , repeat as necessary . You don 't have enough intel . It 's sloppy . If it 's a chance to find ward , it 's worth it . What happens if you walk into a roomful of hydra enforcers With guns pointed at your head ? That 's what you 're here for - - to help . Try to keep up , love . This isn 't funny , hunter . What if there are innocent lives at risk ? There 's always lives at risk ! You were there ... When bobbi was bleeding out in my arms . Ward did that . If I have a shot at finding him , I 'm taking it . I have to ... Before bobbi gets back in the field . Look ... I want ward as bad as you do . But I don 't think his life is worth yours or bobbi 's . Well , on that , we can agree . Once you get the time and place , call me . Yes , mum . ¶ ¶ Bobbi : The dna results came in . They confirm the killer is an inhuman . He 's killing his own kind . I don 't get it . If he knows what it 's like , what we go through , I just - - I refuse to believe mack 's " great white shark " theory . He 's not some mindless wrecking machine . Agreed . The killer 's tracking its prey . The question is how . Alisha knew these people . They were friends of hers before the outbreak . Maybe the killer was , too . It 's possible , but before alisha was attacked , The couple mentioned that they got some weird e-mail , right ? Well , that e-mail had a nasty virus attached to it . It chewed up their operating system like a blender . I was able to un-mangle it , and it looks like The virus was planted to track their location . Do we know of any other inhumans who got this e-mail ? Joey gutierrez didn 't . I checked . But the others - - I don 't know . It 's not like we have a ton of candidates to work with . Reach out to the atcu . Let them know what you found . Taking this team-spirit thing a little far , aren 't we ? Fitz and I grabbed that laptop before they got there . Why would we share this intel ? We know the atcu has found inhumans in the past , Confiscated all their belongings . Let 's see if they 've come across this virus before . If we share with them , what do we get in return ? What do you want ? I don 't know . Let 's start with how many inhumans they 've come across , Where they take them . Daisy has a good point , sir . We don 't know nearly enough about them . I agree , but if we want answers , then we got to play ball . Share the intel . Trace the virus to its source . It was bitter , not sweet at all . I 'd imagined the taste of a fresh strawberry for months , But like most things since being back , It just wasn 't what I 'd remembered . Most things aren 't . Memories have a funny way of changing on you When you 're not looking . How about you ? You feel any different since you 've been back ? Besides your taste buds , I mean . Any trouble sleeping or anxiety ? No . Shock , rage ... Depression ? I know you 're looking for signs of ptsd . But I assure you , I 'm fine . You 've been through something pretty extreme . There will be after-effects , and that 's okay . It 's okay to struggle , To feel uncomfortable in your own skin . I 'm not one of your inhuman patients , dr . Garner . No . No , you 're not . But survivor stories have always fascinated me - - How they got through it . The chilean miners relied on routine - - Work , exercise , rest , gave each other jobs . They had each other . Well , not all of them . One hiker was stranded on mount hood For six nights in the snow . Said her faith saved her - - That and the thought of all the loose ends she left behind , The people she cared about . She never gave up hope . I did . Do you remember a specific moment when that happened ? Honestly , I 'd rather look forward than back . I have a very interesting new project That I 'm trying to focus on . Okay . You don 't have to talk about it . Just know you got a lot of friends here Who care a lot about you . You 're safe now , jemma . It 's over . [ breathes deeply ] You 're wrong . Coulson : She puts up a good front , but I 'm worried about her . You should be . The woman was stranded alone on a barren alien world for months . She 's dealing with a lot of emotions And won 't open up about any of them . I know you can 't discuss specifics , But is she making any progress ? You can 't rush her . No field work . I mean it , phil . And when I give you a recommendation , I want you to respect it this time . Hey , what are you talking about ? I 'm talking about the inhuman you have in containment - - You know , the one I never even met , Let alone cleared for a mission ? Alisha came to us . She was worried about her friends . And how many more like her are you hiding ? That 's not what we 're doing . These people have problems . I 'm not just gonna turn a blind eye And rubber-stamp them for your new team . And I 'm not asking you to . This was a simple recruitment mission . Alisha wanted to go . Nobody saw that attack coming . You trying to justify that to me ... Or to yourself ? [ footsteps approaching ] May ? Coulson . Andrew . Am I interrupting something ? I can 't believe hunter reached out to you like that . I specifically told everyone to give you space While you were on leave . Man 's on a mission . He 's desperate . How desperate ? His latest bad idea - - Walking into a hydra stronghold alone For a shot at finding ward . I admire his courage . Sounds like suicide . Ward knows hunter 's face . If there 's a chance they run into each other on this job - - Hunter needs backup . More than I can provide . That 's saying a lot . Most of our resources are focused On a manhunt right now - - or a monster hunt . But if this leads to ward , that would be huge . When is hunter going in ? I 'm waiting on specifics . But I know hunter 's been operating Primarily on the eastern seaboard . He 's in too deep , phil . It 's affected his judgment . [ chuckles ] What ? It 's like you never left . But I did . Look , I 'm sorry andrew 's here . I didn 't mean to make it more awkward . It 's fine . We 're all professionals . Yeah , but we 're also friends . If the reason you haven 't come back Is because we 're working with him - - It 's not . I told you - - I can find someone else to consult . Don 't . Andrew 's really good at what he does . You need him . Yeah . But I can replace him . You - - not so much . What happened with you two ? [ sighs ] The reason andrew left me had nothing to do with s.H.I.E.L.D. It 's - - it 's about me . Always has been . You 're too hard on yourself . You know that ? Hey . No tie ? Still practicing . Look better without it . Thanks . I 'll call you as soon as hunter reaches out . [ sighs ] Bobbi : The hairs are deteriorating . That 's odd . Did you place it in the right receptacle ? And double-checked the seal . And the stain ? Fitz , we 're dealing with inhuman dna . Anything 's possible . I 'll check it again . [ sighs ] What 's all this ? Data on the monolith ? Schematics ? There 's notes all over this in simmons ' handwriting . Seismic mounts . Cry- - what are you doing ? ! Jemma , I 'm just trying to - - no , don 't . Look , those are mine , and now they 're all out of order . And you - - what did you tell him ? Jemma , relax . We 're - - we 're just analyzing the inhuman 's dna . All this data - - what 's it for ? Look , just stay away from my things . What just happened ? Did she say something to you ? It should come from her . Thought you left . I was waiting for you . Are - - are you back ? No . Melinda , can we talk ? That 's what we 're doing . Yeah . Not here . I mean - - could you slow up for a second , please ? Honestly , andrew , I don 't need to hear any more apologies . We went away to figure out who we 'd be outside of s.H.I.E.L.D. You didn 't like what you saw . Let 's move on . That 's not true . I had a great time . So did I , Until you fell off the face of the earth - - No calls , no texts . That had nothing to do with you . Please , don 't give me the " it 's not you , it 's me " speech . You can do better than that . You 're right . I ... I can do better , and I want to . I 'd just rather not do it here , now . Maybe after my class tomorrow , you could come by . [ scoffs ] I don 't think so . Damn it , melinda , I-I know I 've handled this all wrong . I shouldn 't have walked away like I did . [ sighs ] I did the same to you . Now we 're even . ¶ ¶ [ beep ] [ door opens ] I reached out to the atcu and talked to that guy banks . What did he give you ? Besides a case of the creeps , he said the virus I found Was sent out to the other inhumans they 've come across . They just didn 't spot it . See ? Cooperation pays off . It was hardly cooperation . Not only didn 't they find the virus , But they couldn 't trace it , either . I 'm guessing you did . [ beep ] Meet dwight frye - - Former programmer , serial online gamer , and I.T. Guy . The killer has an I.T. Guy ? What if he was one before he changed ? Interesting theory . He works for the social security administration . Yeah , but he hasn 't been there in weeks . He 'd have access to all kinds of records , Be able to track people . Forget that . How did the atcu not track him ? He 's one of their own . He 's a government employee . You think the atcu knew about him ? Worse . What if they 're running him ? I think the conspiracy nut in you Had a few too many lattes this morning . I did have a latte . It was a double . But if I didn 't know any better , I 'd say you were defending the atcu Or the dragon lady . I assume you mean rosalind . There 's that first-name thing again - - it 's a dead giveaway . I mean , don 't feel bad . She 's sharp , attractive , head of a big , shady organization . I don 't like where this is going . You think I do ? Go grab mack and a flight team . We 're gonna see what this mr . Frye has to say for himself . Copy that . ¶ ¶ Look who 's here . Her again ? Remember , best behavior . Coulson . Ms. Price . See ? Called you first this time . Very nice of you . Signs of life inside ? Banks : All quiet . Perimeter 's locked up . Once the threat 's contained , Our holding facility is prepped to take him . I 'd like to see that sometime , Make sure you 're not going all guantánamo . Oh , well , that can be arranged , As long as I can get something in return , Like a visit to your secret base Or maybe a ride on that fancy new plane ? You know that door won 't open itself , right ? ¶ ¶ [ clatter ] Hey . Hey . It 's okay . We 're not here to hurt you . [ whimpering ] What ? I ... I can 't hear you . What did you say ? Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! [ grunts ] Daisy , you all right ? Yeah . But he 's not . Mr. Frye , come out and say " hello . " How hard did you hit him ? Not that hard . So what 's wrong with him ? I don 't know , but I don 't think he 's our guy . [ groans ] she 's killing me . Get her out of here . He 's having some kind of reaction To our special friend here . You think ? If we want answers , might help if she 's not here . Just a thought . [ sighs ] Well , pretty strong meds you got here . Ever since I turned , migraine hits me like a bus Anytime I get close to one of ... Whatever we are . The rash is just a bonus . So you 're a diving rod for others like you . Is that how you find your victims ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . We have all your computers . We know about the virus - - how you sent it to all of them . Rosalind : You 're the brains of the operation , And your giant pit bull does all the killing for you . Is that it ? Where you going , mr . Frye ? What the - - Be careful . It 's got a laser finger . Talk to us . How did you know who these victims were ? Lash gave me their names . All I did was track them down . Lash ? Big guy , dreads , likes to leave holes in people ? That sounds like our pit bull . Yeah , great . Looks like good old dwight here will lead us right to him . I don 't know where he is . I mean , he always comes to me . If all you did was track down the victims , How did he know their names ? Divine inspiration . You guys don 't get it . You should be helping him , not hunting him . Help him kill people - - 'cause , sure , that makes sense . Do you think he likes doing what he 's doing ? He doesn 't . Ever since I turned , I feel like my skin is on fire And there 's a jackhammer in my head . I wake up thinking that the pain will go away ... But it doesn 't . The only thing that helps is when lash does his thing - - Sends us freaks back to where we belong . I didn 't want this . And I know I 'm not the only one . Mr. Frye , we can help you , but you have to trust me - - This lash is not some angel of mercy . No , he 's no angel . He 's just a guy trying to do the right thing . [ helicopter blades whirring ] Andrew could help him . There 's no way the atcu has anyone on their staff With his experience . And where are they taking him ? Do we even know ? We can 't just give them free rein like this . We can 't just look away . Mack , you accompany them . Check out the containment facility . Gather whatever intel you can . Report back to me . I should be on that truck , too , sir . We got a major hydra operation unfolding . I may need you . Not as much as frye needs me . Look , I don 't like it , " d . " You were in their cross hairs just the other day . Yeah , and look how that worked out . We 're ready to roll . Not quite yet . How heavily sedated is frye ? On a scale of 1 to 10 , about a 6 . No one likes a drooler . Why ? I need you to squeeze two more onto that truck . That 's not what we agreed on . Sharing is a two-way street . We invited you to the party . Now we need to know what you 're doing with the guests . Come on , rosalind . Fair is fair . Just give me a minute . All right . Hop on board . ¶ ¶ Do you really have a laser finger ? Sorry . It 's classified . [ panting ] [ beeping ] Looks like your rehab 's going well . Can 't lie . Doesn 't feel like it . I understand . I read up on your surgeries - - Two on the knee , three on the lung . What 's left of it . Don 't forget those fun-loving abscesses . Well , knowing you , I 'm sure you 'll be 100 % in no time . I 'm sorry I snapped before . No apology necessary . I thought you told fitz what I told you , and I - - Jemma , seriously , stop . I mean , here I am , complaining to you , After what you 've been through . Have you told anyone else that you want to go back ? You might want to . There 's someone in particular who 's really worried about you . [ sighs ] I wonder who that might be . He 's driving me nuts , you know ? The other day , he snapped at me Just because I put a bio sample into a clear specimen bag . Clear ? [ chuckles ] Well , " b " is for " blue " is for " biological . " And now I see how that would drive you out of the lab . Actually , um ... It 's not all fitz 's fault . [ sighs ] I just got this old , Familiar feeling in my gut and had to run . What feeling is that ? Like hunter 's in trouble . ¶ ¶ Clearly , punctuality ain 't one of hydra 's core values . Funny . Hands on the car . [ scoffs ] I thought we were past all that . Got to make sure you 're clean - - director 's orders . Director ? It 's a thing with the boss - - Some kind of s.H.I.E.L.D. Nonsense . In you go , richy . Oh , I ain 't getting in the bloody boot . It stinks of rotten bananas in there . Does , doesn 't it ? [ sighs ] Attaboy . Bloody ... Get comfy , now . It 's gonna be a long ride . Oh , when you say long , how - - [ sighs ] I feel like we 're driving in circles . I bet we are . Probably buying time For mr . Banks to clean up their facility . Didn 't you catch how fast he left the scene ? Yeah , so he could get rid of anything Roz doesn 't want us to see . Yeah , that , or he 's prepping a cell for you . [ scoffs ] it 's his funeral . I feel like his meds are wearing off . [ thud ] [ tires screech ] [ metal scraping ] [ groans ] [ grunting ] I only told them the truth - - That you 're being ... Merciful . I 'm not merciful . I 'm necessary . No . No , no . [ grunting ] ¶ ¶ [ grunts ] Mack ? ¶ ¶ [ grunts ] What the hell happened ? The atcu brought us all to a local e.R. To get checked out . You got a concussion , separated your shoulder . Everyone else make it ? Not frye . Lash killed him . Lucky he didn 't kill you , too . Yeah . Lucky . What 's up , " d " ? You holding something back ? I ... I saw something . And I 'm not sure , But I don 't think lash is just some great white shark . I think he can turn into a person . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Wait . You- - you 're telling me that you saw him transform Into a - - a regular guy ? It was all shadows , so I didn 't get a good look at him , But it would explain a lot - - How he comes and goes , disappears when he needs to . I mean , think about it , mack . He could be anybody . Oh , good . You 're awake . How you feeling ? Like a truck fell on me . Well , at least you lived to tell the tale . Hmm . Where 's coulson ? I 've been trying to reach him . He 's on a mission after a high-value target - - A human one , so not your thing . [ indistinct conversation ] Okay ? Yeah . Good luck . Coulson 's leaving with a tac team ? May and hunter have a lead on ward . Sounds like a dodgy situat- - Wait . They didn 't tell you ? I 'm sorry . [ sighs ] It 's tough when people keep things from you . [ beep ] [ tires screech ] [ knock on trunk ] Wakey-wakey . Where are we ? [ grunts ] Welcome to where all the fun begins . Director 's still mulling over a code name for the place - - " nemesis , " " omega point . " Sounds a bit too s.H.I.E.L.D. For my liking . Rumor has it the director spent some time with them . You planning some sort of raid ? [ scoffs ] Always planning something . You can ask the director yourself . So ... This the new guy ? Yeah . Turn around , richy . Yeah , richy . Why so shy ? My name isn 't richy Director . Director , get to cover ! Aah ! Check the perimeter . Look for s.H.I.E.L.D. Reinforcements . Kebo : I got nothing ! Not a man , not a vehicle in sight ! Ward : Come on , hunter . You weren 't actually dumb enough To come here all cowboy , were you ? Sorry , this coming from the guy Who shot his own girlfriend by mistake ? I was hoping you were dead and bobbi was coming for me . At least that rematch would have been more even . Hunter : Hardly . I heard it took two of you after hours of torture . Yeah , lesson learned . Should have rigged the door with a grenade . [ gunshots ] Took your bloody time . [ gunshots ] How many did you count ? 11 , including ward . I 've taken out five . Slow day ? Ward : May ... Is that you ? 'cause that would be great . I mean , I was hoping to hold out for a little while longer . Coulson , what 's your e.T.A. ? We 're still 20 minutes out from your position . You need to get out of there , may , right now . I 'm not sure we can do that . I don 't care if a fleet of helicarriers flies in here . That son of a bitch is mine . Ward : So glad you 're here , may . I was planning on heading out with a truck full of weapons That hunter so kindly supplied . Looking to cause a little mayhem , Draw s.H.I.E.L.D. Out , When , instead ... [ beep ] ... You came to me . You 're trapped , ward . Hey . Don 't interrupt . Not before you see my surprise . That 's a live feed , in case you 're wondering . Dr. Garner 's on his way to teach a class right now - - Psych 301 , I believe . I 've got my men on him right now . He 's bluffing . Watching him die like this isn 't quite the same as , Oh , let 's say , holding the woman you love in your arms While she breathes her last breath . But , hey ... It 's the best I could do on such short notice . He 's trying to get in your head . The video is fake . [ sighs ] Hey , what are you doing ? Alexander : Hey , professor . [ lighter clicking ] Where you been ? If I don 't call off my men in the next 30 seconds , Dr. Andrew garner , the ex-mr . May , is a dead man . All you have to do is put your weapons down , And I 'll let you go . Son of a bitch . You 're lying ! I 'm not . Give you my word , may . [ lighter clicks ] You know , you 're a tough guy to track down . What 's going on here , alex ? [ bell jingles ] [ lock turns ] [ clicking continues ] He has a warehouse full of guns here that I brought him . A lot of people will die , may . May ? It 's andrew . [ breathing heavily ] I 'm sorry . No ! Coulson : May , what 's happening ? Come in . May . May : It 's andrew . Ward 's going to kill him . You have to get to him ! [ grunts ] Come on ! Come on ! [ gunshots ] [ gun cocks ] [ grunts ] Lie down . [ breathing heavily ] ¶ ¶ [ breathing heavily ] [ ringing ] [ panting ] [ breathing rapidly ] [ rhythmic knock on door ] Um ... Come in . [ sighs ] Thank you , fitz , but there 's no reason to dote over me . I 'm fine . Why do you want to rebuild the portal , jemma ? I saw the schematics , the data , The astronomical research you 've been doing , and I just can 't understand it . After everything you 've been through ... Why would you - - because I have to get back there . [ sighs ] And I need your help to do it . Something happened to me , fitz , on the other side . It 's time I told you the truth ... About everything .

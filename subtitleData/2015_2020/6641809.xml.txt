 Bellamy : We were born in space . They told us the ground was uninhabitable , but they were wrong , and we 've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed . Some of us have been broken by it , but most of us are still here , searching for other survivors from the ark , trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness--a home . Our leaders believe that to survive , we need to make peace with the grounders , but peace is a foreign concept here . Clarke : I 'm not going in . Clarke- - it 's just gonna remind me of what I did to get them here . May we meet again . The grounders out there will attack this camp . If we wait , we die . 10 men with automatic rifles is all it would take . You 're asking me to get you the guns . Get out of the way , grounder . Abby : What the hell do you think you 're doing ? What you didn 't have the guts to . - Pike for chancellor ! - Pike ! Pike ! Pike ! Congratulations , Mr. chancellor . Let 's finish what we started . Thinking about home ? Thinking about whether arkadia is home . When I left , it had a different name . I was different . You left a hero to your people , and you return one . The mountain slayer returns with the body of the ice queen . You bring them justice . You bring them justice . We bring them peace . Man : Hey , here they are . My god , look at them . - What happened to them ? - Look at that . - They 're in bad shape . - Pretty hurt . - What happened ? - Bellamy , you ok ? - I 'm fine . - What happened out there ? - What 's going on ? - The chancellor said ... Lock it up . Man : All right . Seal it up . Pike : Everybody listen up . Woman : Hey , hey , hey . 24 hours ago , you elected me your chancellor . Every action I 've taken since and every action I will take will be to achieve one sacred goal- - the creation of a self-sustaining , prosperous , and safe arkadia . - All right ! - Yeah . Pike : This morning on a muddy field , our people paid tribute to those who have been taken from us by sending a message to the grounders . This land is ours now . Resist , and you will be met by force . Fight , and you will be greeted by death . Today is a new beginning . Mark it down . Remember it just like the grounders will remember it . Chancellor pike , you tell them , pike . No wounded . 10 against 300 , and there 's no wounded . How 's that possible ? Man : Heda ! All bullet wounds . Man : Heda ... - Indra . - Heda . Nngh ! Ok . Aah ! Nngh ! I need bandages . Stay away . You 're one of them . Indra ... Nngh ! Indra , what happened here ? They attacked while we slept . Our watch was to the north looking for azgeda . They killed our archers first . Our infantry couldn 't get close . Then they executed the wounded . The summit was two days ago . How could Kane do this ? It wasn 't Kane . It was pike . How did you escape ? Bellamy . Bellamy was with them ? He wanted to spare the wounded , but they wouldn 't listen . He convinced pike to let me live so I could deliver a message . What message ? Skaikru rejects the coalition . This is their land now . We can leave , or we can die . Send riders . I call upon the armies of the twelve clans . In a day 's time , we lay waste to arkadia and everyone within its walls . Man : Sha , heda . Mount up . Wait . Give me time to fix this . What are you doing ? I can 't let you leave , Clarke . So I 'm a prisoner now , just like that ? Yes . Lexa , let me go to arkadia . No . At least let me talk to Kane . We can bring him here . Indra , at the summit , Kane told me he gave you a radio , a way to signal him . Do it , please . Is it true you tried to leave camp to see indra yesterday ? Look . Don 't you have more important things to worry about than me sneaking out of camp ? As it turns out , that 's why you 're here . Indra signaled . She wants to meet . I 'd go myself , but pike 's watching everything I do now . You want me to go see indra ? I need you to . I 'm in , but how do I get out ? The gate is armed with- - crawl space door in 20 feet drops you outside the camp wall . Get out there . You find out what the hell happened . Then you report back here . Can you do that ? I was born for this . Man on P.A. : Marcus Kane , report to the chancellor 's office . Marcus Kane to the chancellor 's office . Our goal is secure access to water and arable land with defensible terrain on as many sides of us as possible . A 15-kilometer perimeter around arkadia should be sufficient . 15 kilometers ? Sir , there 's a grounder village . Which will , no doubt , be the staging area for a retaliatory attack . Clearing it will be our first order of business . What 's the location of the village ? Clear the village ? Give us the room . Yes , sir . Kane and Lincoln are waiting outside . Thought you might like this back . Do you have something to say to me ? We went too far . I know it seems harsh , but we don 't leave survivors . We don 't have the medical supplies to treat their people , and we can 't risk them coming back to kill us . You know , we 've all learned pretty quickly that war causes us to do things that we 'll spend the rest of our lives trying to forget . The only advice i can give you is to think about the lives we saved today , not the ones that were lost . Can you do that ? Yes , sir . He 's ready for you . What the hell happened out there ? We did what we had to do . Wake up . You attacked an army that was there to help us . You murdered innocent people . Is that who you are now ? You thought you couldn 't live with yourself after mount weather . Well , you just started a war that 'll kill us all . You need to wake up , and don 't tell me the difference between azgeda and trikru . Trikru killed 37 of my friends before you even touched the ground . We didn 't start anything . They did . They ? You know what I meant . I used to . Denae 's still getting worse . Antibiotics every two hours . Keep me updated . - What the hell , Abby ? - Calm down . - I know that you 're upset . - Upset ? I just showed up for work and found out you fired me . I don 't fire people . Not clearing me medically is the same damn thing . Come on . Let 's go sit down . No . I don 't need to sit down . My leg is fine . No , it 's not , and riding a patrol and working that wall are making your conditions worse . So what , do nothing ? That 's gonna make my leg heal ? No . Your leg is never gonna heal . Our goal is pain reduction- - that 's it--and if you keep pushing this hard , even that 's not gonna happen . You can still be useful . They 've been busy . Welcome home , thelonious . Let 's begin . Otan , stay close . Man : Open up ! I didn 't see that coming . Man : I want people on that gate . Chancellor jaha ? Sir , it 's good to see you . Shawn gillmer ? Farm station made it ? Not enough of us , sir . Hands where i can see them . It 's ok . He 's with me . Gillmer : Sorry , sir . No grounders through the gates , chancellor 's orders . Jaha : I said , he 's with me . Tell him to hand over the pack right now . Hey , stop it . No ! - Otan ! - Agh ! Come on . We 're taking him . Otan ! Man : Hold your fire . Medic ! We need a medic ! This belongs to me . He was going for my gun . You 'll be all right , otan . Go to the city of light . Alie will be waiting for you on the other side . Man : Right over here . Hurry . Thelonious ? He 's gone . I 'm sorry . Don 't be . Death is not the end . It 's good to see you , Abby . You there . Murphy : Took you long enough . Uh ! What did he say ? He said you 're cute for a thief . Yeah . Well , too bad he 's not really my type . Let 's get out of here . Jaha : Oh , don 't worry about John Murphy . That boy 's a fighter . Abby : And the others ? You left with 12 people thelonious . Kane . Ah , welcome home , my friend . Where 's your uniform ? Pike just relieved me of my command , stripped Lincoln of his commission . Heh . You always did have good timing . Abby caught me up . I 'm sorry about the election , Marcus . Forget the election . The war you predicted the day you left is about to happen . Ask him where he 's been . I found the city of light . Well , that 's great ... Isn 't it ? Ask his friend otan . Apparently , he 's there right now . I don 't blame you for doubting , Abby . I know how it sounds , but it is real , and it is incredible . Everything that you worry about now- - war , power- - none of it matters in the city of light . I heard you were here , sir . And I heard you made it , Hannah . I was so glad . Chancellor pike would like to speak with you . We 'll finish this later . Man : Right this way , sir . The chancellor is waiting . You look good for a man who 's been in the wilderness for 4 months . So do you . I heard you had it pretty rough . We gave worse than we got . I heard that , too . - You don 't approve ? - I don 't judge . Since when ? I 'm not the same man that i was on the ark , Charles . None of us is . I was a teacher . Now I 'm chancellor . I am wondering , though , what do you know ? Alie : He 's threatened by you . I 'm just a man who wants to save his people , no threat to you . Save us ? Forgive me for being blunt , thelonious , but I need to ask why you 've returned . I just told you- - to save my people . Do you want him to think you 're a fool ? - You actually believe that ? - Yes . I do . Ok . I 'm game . How , exactly , are you gonna do that ? By freeing the minds from the bonds of physical and spiritual pain . I am here to show the people of arkadia the way . You 've lost him . Have some faith . Tell you what . Pike : As long as you stay out of my way , you can save whoever wants saving . Lord knows there 's enough pain here to go around . Thank you , chancellor . Oh ... Clarke : The bleeding 's stopped . We need to get you something for the pain . Uh ... Clarke : Octavia ? Where 's Kane ? He sent me . Indra . Thank god . How did this happen ? Kane lost the election to pike . Everything 's different . Your people voted for this ? No . No . I don 't believe that . What do you know , Clarke ? You haven 't been here . Listen to me . The grounder army is gonna be here in less than a day . I need to see bellamy . Bellamy was a part of this . He 's with pike . What makes you think he 'll help us ? He saved indra 's life . Clarke : If what octavia 's saying is true , then pike trusts him . If I can get to him , he can get to pike . You can 't just walk through the gates , Clarke . You 've been living with their enemy . If it were me , I 'd kill you on the spot . I can get her in . So where you want to head next- - the north , south ? We 've been on a heck of a roll . I want to go after my brother . We 've talked about this . Otan 's with jaha at camp . Why would you want to go there ? He 's my brother . If there 's a chance , I have to try and get him back . Going after otan 's not a good move . - John- - - it 's not a survivor 's move . Then wait for me . I 'll come back . In this world , when people leave , they don 't come back . - I did . - Not for me . I just so happened to be there . John , come with me . I 'm not that stupid . Man : Reveille . On your feet . Line up now . Go . What are you doing ? These are sick people . You can 't just throw them out into the cold . We 're not . They 're being interned . What ? Lincoln : Out of my way . - Stand up . - Come on . Bellamy : Lincoln , you don 't want to be here right now . Oh . We asked them to come here . We can 't spare the supplies . - Denae . - Lincoln , no . Uh ... She is too sick to move . Uh ... Looks like she 's moving just fine to me . Bellamy : Gillmer , back off . Jackson , why did you bring him here ? Uhh ! Uh ! Uh ! Rrgh ! Rrgh ! - Lincoln- - - uh ! Abby : Lincoln . Lincoln ! He goes with them . Take him . Move . Sorry we had to do this the hard way . Jaha : We all have pain . Some of it is physical from injuries or age . Some is mental , you know , living with the loss of our loved ones . If you think about it , whether we fight that pain or succumb to it , the result is the same . It diminishes our lives , robs us of our passions and pastimes and damages relationships between friends and lovers . What if I told you that there 's a simple way to eliminate that pain ? Raven : I 'd say you 're full of crap . There 's no simple way to eliminate pain , and you know it . Alie : So much suffering . If we get her , the others will come . This can make it go away . Heh . Please . The key to the city of light , to your salvation and relief . Ok . Ok . You 're telling these people what , that they swallow that , and they 'll be living in happy town for the rest of their lives ? You should be ashamed of yourself . - We need her . - She 's not ready . I 'll be here when you are . Man : Kindly move forward . Straight ahead . Move . Man : Pick up your feet . Come on . Octavia : Lincoln . Lincoln . Lincoln : I 'm ok . Don 't fight this . He 's right . Lincoln , what the hell is going on ? We 're interning the grounders . Lincoln 's here because of a disturbance in sick bay . Man : Last one . Let 's go . - What 's happening to you ? - Octavia- - I saw what you and pike did to lexa 's army . Bellamy , you killed everyone . - Keep your voice down . - What 's wrong ? You 're not proud of massacring an army that was here to help us ? We 're not doing this here . Good . Then let 's go because I 'm not even close to done . You need to be careful , o . If you keep this up , I won 't be able to protect you . Thanks for the warning . I 'm serious . Look at yourself . It is time to stop playing grounder before you get yourself hurt . I 'm not playing anything . This is who I am . You 're my brother . I shouldn 't have to tell you that . Now I 'm done . Go easy on octavia . I had to beg her to get me into camp . What are you doing here , Clarke ? We need to talk . Oh , you 've decided that , the mighty wanheda who chose the grounders over her own people , who turned her back on us when we came to rescue you . Now you want to talk . I came here to tell you that the ice nation has paid a price . Justice has been served for the attack on mount weather . I came here to tell you it 's over . There it is again . Why do you get to decide it 's over ? We did our part . We ? Lexa and I. The ice queen is dead . The problem was solved , and then you let pike ruin everything . Why are you here , Clarke ? Arkadia needs to make things right , or lexa and the twelve clans will wipe us out . Let her try . Please tell me that going to war is not what you want . We 've been at war since we landed . At least pike understands that . Pike is the problem . This isn 't who you are . You 're wrong . This is who I 've always been , and I let you and octavia and Kane convince me that we could trust these people when they have shown over and over who they are , and I won 't let anyone else die for that mistake . Bellamy ... I need you , and we don 't have much time . You need me ? Yes . I do . I need the guy who wouldn 't let me pull that lever in mount weather by myself . You left me . You left everyone . - Bellamy- - - enough , Clarke . You are not in charge here , and that 's a good thing because people die when you 're in charge . You were willing to let a bomb drop on my sister . Then you made a deal with lexa , who left us in mount weather to die and forced us to kill everyone who helped us , people who trusted me . I- - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for leaving . I knew I could because they had you . I know we can fix this . I 'm sorry , too . Hey . No . Don 't . No . Bellamy , don 't . God- - oh ... Jaha : Zero-g mechanic sorting scrap metal out for ammo , huh ? This Abby 's idea ? Is it supposed to make you feel better ? I can help you , raven . Don 't , all right ? Everyone thinks they have an idea on how to help me feel better- - stay in camp , only do jobs where i can sit down , ask every time i need something on a high shelf- - but you know what ? I 'm not that person . People think i can just change and my pain will go away , but I can 't . I can 't do that , and I can 't do this . What have you got to lose ? Pike should be in his quarters . Bellamy , you don 't have to do this . Yes , I do . Just let me go . Believe it or not , I am doing this for your own good . Octavia : Believe it or not , I 'm doing this for yours . You can 't just hit a guard . I just did . Let her go . I can 't do that . Octavia : They 're coming . You should go . Uh ... Uh ! Clarke , hurry up . Man : Get them on deck two . - Let 's go . - Follow me . Come on . Mom . We know what happened . We know what pike did . Is there anything we can do to prevent a retaliation ? Abby , hurry . We came here to give them pike . He 's the duly elected chancellor . Our people knew what they were voting for . Besides , he has the guards and all the guns . Can 't get close to him . And that 's not the way we do things . Then maybe it 's time we change the way we do things . Man on P.A. : Security breach . Lock down the exits . You two need to go now . What about Lincoln ? You want to help him , do it from the outside with this . The range isn 't great . You stay close and wait for me to contact you . Now go . Come with me . I wish I could . May we meet again . I do a much better job of making you look dead . Your brother- - it can wait until i can convince you to join me , which I will . Perfect timing . We know you 're not alone . Where 's the girl ? She left . Find her . On your knees . You 've been caught stealing in the commander 's woods . The punishment for this is death . I 'll ask you once more- - where 's the girl ? Go float yourself . Where did you get this ? I guess if you kill me now , you 'll never find out . On your feet . Move . Keep walking . Miller : Careful . This one doesn 't like to be chained up . Girlfriend 's not here to free you this time . It 's from Abby for denae . Octavia ? She got out with Clarke . Heda ... Where 's octavia ? She 's watching over camp . Lexa : So tell us , Clarke , how does this end ? Have you come up with a way to save your people yet again ? No . Only you can do that . What happened here was an act of war . Your army was here to help us , and my people slaughtered them . You have every right to respond , every right to wipe us out , or you can change the way you do things . Indra : Why should she change ? Blood must have blood . Really ? Because from where I stand , the only way that ends is with everyone dead . So what kind of leader do you want to be , the kind who kills every chance she gets because that 's your way ? Or the kind who shows the world a better way ? You consider letting a massacre go unavenged a better way ? If it ends a cycle of violence , yes . If it brings about peace , yes . Someone has to take the first step . Let it be you . You say you want peace . Everything you 've done was to achieve that , yet here we stand on the brink of another war , a war you could stop . Commander , you can 't seriously be considering this . I 'm not considering it . I 'm doing it . Heda , please . Indra , our people act as if war is easier than peace . If that 's so , should we not try and achieve the more difficult goal ? Polis will not support you . Titus- - Titus is my subject . They 're all my subjects . Do you say they will defy me ? Will you defy me ? No , heda . I will not . Then let it be known . Blood must not have blood .

 My name is molly woods . I 'm an astronaut . My husband john , a robotics engineer , Created a lifelike robot called a humanich . We adopted the prototype as our son . His name is ethan . Everything changed when i went to space on a 13-month Solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . I 'm pregnant . How is that even possible ? The child- - part human , Part-alien- - was unlike Anything the world had ever seen . How did you get so big so fast ? And he was dangerous . Eventually ... Run ! I lost both of my sons . Ethan ! Mom ! And my husband . Some people say i 've gone crazy . This is a cover-up ! That 's what this is ! Get your hands off of me ! I say there 's more to the story . It 's up to me to find the truth Before it 's too late . Previously on extant ... There are 29 known deaths In the united states in the last six months . All women who died from accelerated pregnancies . All of which trace back to your son . Dad ? I 'm pregnant . Julie : All we have to do is power her up . Did you steal that dress from my closet ? No , i printed it out . I specifically told you it was inappropriate . Ethan ? Are you all right ? These glitches ? I don 't know if i can fix What you 've done . Molly : I am really sick here . Something is happening to me . And i think i 'm going crazy . This is the future , molly . You 're going to have to make a choice soon- - are you with them Or us ? I 'm sorry , ahdu . But i 'm with them . Oh , my god ! Toby ! Female voice : Laser groomer 3000 Set to level three . Right hand complete . Please insert your left hand . Left hand complete . Woman : If you 've become pregnant in the last three months , You may be at risk of carrying the evh-789 virus- - A deadly pathogen passed in vitro . Please appear at any one of these government clinics To take a free ... ( thud ) If you 're infected , we can help . But time is of the essence . Oh , my god ! Toby ! You wore your vest ? Oh . ( groans ) oh , god , toby ! He was here . He was here and i thought you were him . I 'm so sorry . At least now we know you can pull the trigger . Security , gina ? All doors and windows secured . New locks . Installed and engaged . Mom usually doesn 't allow chocolate in the morning . Well ... While julie 's in dc , there 's gonna be special provisions . Chocolate will be served all day long . I don 't understand why i couldn 't go . I made a mistake . You overrode four direct commands last week . Mm , i didn 't know you were counting . Did i kill that dress or what ? You looked very nice . You have a problem with authority . You make it sound so serious . Well , nothing that can 't be Fixed with a few lines of protocol code . I don 't want you to change me . I told you it 's just one line of code , okay ? An authority limiter . You 're not even gonna notice . I 'm sure that 's what they tell chickens When they clip their wings . You 're the property of gsc farms . Whose property is ethan ? His ... Mom 's , i guess ? ( short laugh ) Ethan ? Hey , buddy , are you still with us ? I was thinking of chickens . See what you did ? ( laughs ) Shepherd : Scientists win wars . World war ii , russian quadrangle , Second kuwait- - all stopped By cracking a code . You are genetic code breakers . The best and the brightest . What we 're looking for here Is a biological needle in a haystack . A hybrid-specific virus That will eradicate the aliens , But leave the human population unaffected . It 's a genetic puzzle of the utmost urgency . Solve it , you can write your names in the history books . Fail ... And we 'll all just be footnotes In the scrolls of a new civilization . How are you ? I 'm fine . Just a few broken ribs . Better than bullet holes . How are you ? Other than visits from my alien son And shooting you ... Hey , friendly fire . It happens . Give yourself time . It 's only been a few days . Female voice : Good morning , general shepherd . Your destination , please ? Tier level four . You have clearance for tier level four . So , i , uh , saw the psa about the clinics . What are we doing with these women ? Testing ... Quarantining If need be . And then what ? It 's uncharted territory right now . ( elevator ding echoes ) Sure you 're okay ? ( groans ) Yeah . I 'm okay . Male voice : Please stand by for infrared bio scan . The gsc launched a virus team nine months ago Since they found out that you were contaminated . It 's a little doomsday project we hoped we wouldn 't need . Tier four access confirmed . Now , we 're rotating in brainpower bimonthly , Working graveyards before we use up Our last live test subject . We 've got test subjects ? Well , of sorts . Molly : These are the spores sean glass brought back . And you 're mapping their dna , looking for genetic anomalies . Mm-hmm . The kids from boston had some luck . Made a virus that targets the hybrids In a rather ugly but efficient way . The problem is ... It 'll kill humans , too . Which is what we 're trying to avoid . We 're at war . It 's a war we can 't win with soldiers or drones . Make me a virus that kills them . Not us . Woman : If you 're infected , we can help . But time is of the essence . If you 've become pregnant in the last three months , You may be at risk of carrying the evh-789 virus , A deadly pathogen passed in vitro . Please appear at any one of these government clinics To take a free screening . If you 're infected , we can help . But time is of the essence . Sir ? Hi . Is this the way to the cafeteria ? You 're in an authorized personnel area . I 'm sorry , my wife is crazed . And when a pregnant woman says , " chef salad , " I say , " blue cheese or ranch ? " Can i get your name ? Wait ! Get your hands off her ! No ! Honey ? Where are you taking her ? ! You know what ? The safe bet Says i should get a side of both . This is a restricted area , sir . Anyone who comes back here , I 'm gonna need their name . Bag the salad . I see you have your hands full . Sir , i 'm gonna need your name ! Sir ! Sir ! If you 're infected , we can help . But time is of the essence . If you 've become pregnant in the last three months , You may be at risk of ... Hey . I told you to wait in the car . It was hot . What are you doing , dad ? Change of plans . This place has a hotel california vibe . What ? You can check in , but you can 't check out . Oh , you think everything 's a freaking conspiracy lately . I don 't think , i know . Man : Houston ... We have a wall gazer . All this is like a book that 's been Edited for millions of years . You could take this to bed with you each night , like ... 1,001 arabian nights , and you could read a different story ... Every night . Eh , how about we tell the story of nate malone . And how he saved the world by creating an alien-killing virus . And then retired to turks and caicos . ( chuckles ) You must be molly woods , Our prodigal astronaut . And you must be nate malone . Future beachcomber . What is that board over there ? Junk dna . It 's where either the meaning of life is hidden Or simply the husks Of a cornstalk . Lots of meaningless strands That don 't add up to much more Than god 's candy wrapper . Is this communal data ? Take what you want . It 's the discard wall . Hmm . Thank you . Mm-hmm . Velez : You installed molly woods On the virus team ? She 's a top exobiologist and geneticist With unique experience of our test subjects . Who has a knack for speed-dialing the hybrids . First she shows up at a bar with our target . And then he stops by her place after a busy day Of wiping out the human race ? I mean , co ... Come on , toby , you and i don 't believe in coincidences . Which is why we need to keep her close . She has a connection we might need to rely on . News flash- - toby , she shot you ! Which was a mistake . We 've seen this before with the offspring . This is what he does . Gets inside your head . What if it wasn 't a mistake ? What if she shot you to protect him ? It 's her son . I think you 're letting your feelings About her cloud your judgment . My feelings ? I don 't think that that 's where the problem is . What are you doing ? It 's okay . I won 't tell anybody . Who is she ? Her name 's molly . I keep seeing her . Charlie says it 's a glitch . What kind ? I don 't know . Maybe i saw her photo somewhere , and my circuits got crossed . Does that make sense to you ? Have you thought about trying to find her And ask her yourself ? I 'm not supposed to leave the house alone . It 's one of the rules . Rules . Mom says they protect us . They limit us . Maybe we 've found your first mission , soldier . Mission ? ( chuckles ) I don 't know . You haven 't undergone all of your training , And i would hate to rush you out into the field . I 'm ready . ( laughing ) : I bet . You guys are supposed to be dark . Sorry . I got lonely . Sleep tight , soldier . ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ( aural fractals sound ) ( computer chimes ) Male voice : We have pattern recognition . ( computer chimes ) We have pattern lock . Are you okay ? Houston , we have stories . Man : Welcome to crave automat . You crave it , we print it . From hamburgers and fries To chicken and waffles , we print it all . Hey . Hey . ( phone ringing ) ( indistinct whispering ) ( knocking on door ) Who is it , gina ? Gina : Jd richter , former police detective , Number 7-7-8-7-8-9 . Yeah , yeah , i know . ( knocking on door ) Connect intercom , please . ( clears throat ) I thought we already said our good-byes , jd . Richter : I need to talk to you , molly . It 's important . ( gasps ) Give me a minute , jd . Intercom off . You have to get out of here . Right now . I make a nice frittata . Go . Out the back door . Right now . Go . Oh , okay . Um ... Call me . ( whispering ) : Oh , god . ( water stops running ) Oh , my god . What is happening to me ? Female voice : Right hand complete . Left hand complete . Oh , my god . I don 't really know how to start this other than to say I have a favor ... Am i interrupting something ? What 's the favor ? It 's about my daughter . You have a daughter ? A pregnant one . We 're running late ! I don 't want to go . Don 't start . Ethan . Ethan . Listen , molly , i am freaked out . This is like one bad dream . Okay , have you told her anything that i 've told you ? Like what ? What-what am i gonna tell her ? This is the first time she 's showed up at my door in years . We barely know what to say to each other . And i 'm pretty sure that alien talk 's not the way to start . Okay , where has she been living ? I don 't know , she won 't say And she says i have no right to ask . And she 's probably right . Does she have a mother ? Yeah , they , uh ... They don 't get along . My ex is very judgmental . It 's an occupational hazard . Oh , she must be a cop . Circuit court judge , actually . Molly , i-i need your help . I-i don 't have anywhere else to turn . Lucy : What are you doing ? Charlie : I 'm accessing his gps . Wha ... ? He shut it off . ( chuckles ) Guess he doesn 't want to be found . Come on . Hey . Who 's she ? This is the friend i was telling you about . Kelsey , molly . Molly , kelsey . She 's here to help us . Okay . You 're a doctor ? A biologist . Ah , that figures . Once i needed a math tutor , and jd brought home a bail bondsman . Hey , say what you want , but that dude knew his numbers . I 'm gonna do the same test the clinics are doing . Okay . Now , do you have any symptoms ? Anything unusual ? I get headaches . They come and go , i probably just need to eat more . Am i gonna be okay ? I 'm gonna get the test back by tonight , And then we 'll take it from there . Oh , god , i 'm sorry . Excuse me . ( kelsey coughs ) Well , she 's charming . Yeah , a chip off the old block . I 'll call you . You gonna make me wait all day ? I will wait all day . ( aural fractals sound ) Molly , hey . ( grass rustles loudly ) ( muffled ) : Molly , how are you ? Hey , molly . What ? I 'm fine . No . No , y-you 're not fine . People who are fine don 't disappear mid-conversation . What 's going on with you ? I don 't know . But i think i 'm sick . Wh-what kind of sick ? Well , i thought it was radiation poisoning From my last mission , but it 's getting worse . So i don 't know , but i think it 's ... Spore contamination . Because i-i see things And-and i hear things That are strange , and i ... Well , i apparently do things That just don 't Feel like me . Have you ... Well , have you seen or talked to a doctor About any of this ? No . I have not . After three months in restwell recovery , I will never talk to another doctor For as long as i live , so , no . All right , here 's what i think . I think that you need ... A keeper , You know , to look out for you . Until you figure out what 's going on . Well , you are already watching over somebody . I 'll be okay . Charlie : Please , god , wake me up from this nightmare ! Why don 't you call the police ? Because the police have a crappy track record With little humanich boys . And he 's not supposed to be out . I mean , there could be Serious repercussions . Julie might lose her job ? She might lose ethan . He-he didn 't mention anything to you About where he might be going , or ... Um , he 's mentioned a lot . Okay , i 'm pulling up our last conversation . The entire history of us . ( laughs ) Ah . Ah ? Wha ... ( giggles ) sorry . That was his birthday . Um ... Wait . Wait , he was curious about a woman . A woman ? Her name was molly . ¶ ¶ Man : Hey . You shouldn 't be here , son . This is red-tagged . I 'm looking for somebody . Hmm . This was her address . Molly woods . Yeah , she used to live here . Are you lost ? No . I 'm on a mission . Do you know where she lives now ? I 'm sorry , kid . All i know is on this red tag . Come on . Let 's get out of here . ( sighs ) ( indistinct chatter ) More junk dna ? Well , one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . The work you did last night Had some very novel characteristics- - Chimeric in origin . Chimeric ? Are you sure ? Yeah . The spores have the capacity For male and female organs . Are we looking for new test subjects ? No . Just curious . I hear if they find More in utero subjects , They 're not gonna bother with extraction , Or even saving the mothers . Really ? That 's what i hear . Richter : Hey . Where exactly you think you 're going ? I 'm going to the clinic . You know what ? This isn 't up for a debate . We 're gonna wait for molly To get here . Yeah , i looked her up . She 's famous , you know . She was in a cuckoo farm recovery center , dad , Which i know in your book Means low-hanging fruit , but ... Really ? A ) don 't be a smartass . B ) don 't read that crap . All right ? You 're gonna have to trust me here . Trust ? Trust requires a track record . ( sighs ) I 'm working on that . Sorry , no do-overs . Kelsey ... You left , remember ? All right , to be fair , i was kicked out . That 's what a wife does when her husband 's cheating on her . More than once . Look , i screwed up ... Not one life , but three . I-i get that . And i know You 're right , there 's no do-overs . But what i 'm trying to do here , kelsey , Is facilitate a way for us to move forward . It 's too late . Kelsey ... I can 't let you go to that clinic . What are you gonna do ? Lock me up ? ( two gunshots ) You 're insane ! ( car door slams ) kelsey ... Kelsey , where are you going ? I think that went pretty well . ( motorcycle revs ) No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! Kelsey ! ( engine starts ) What 's up , man ? I got everything you need Right here . Couple of drops Of this in your eyes ... Aw , it 's just a kid , man ! Who cares ? Nice work , eagle eyes . What 's up , homes ? You a little lost ? I 'm looking for an apartment . Uh , 19203 grand avenue . You don 't have a gps ? I turned it off so i won 't be found . I got you , brother . You 're actually not that far off . See that light up there ? Gonna head up there and take a left . After that , you 're looking for apartment numbers . Thanks . Hey . Nice scooter . Ethan : Thank you . I 'll take it As payback for the money You just lost me . Why don 't you get out of here , kid ? The next time we 're taking your shoes , too . Your indexes are off . They always come in pairs , Either c and g , or t and a . That 's assuming cytosine and guanine Or thymine and adenine . They 're not human . Well , a banana has 50 % of our dna , And baking yeast has 80 % . So maybe this hybrid dna Is closer to ours than we think . You can 't use the same genetic markers That we apply to human dna . Humor me . Are you seeing this ? Yeah . Sound waves . Does this have a speaker ? Uh , strickland 's a throbbing gristle fan . He has the lab wired for ear-splitting pain . ( static ) Male voice : Help me . Help me . Do you hear that ? ( static continues ) hear what ? It 's saying , " help me . " ( static ) Stop playback . " help me . " that 's what they 're saying , toby . Can 't you hear that ? It 's a geneticist 's Holy grail , a message encoded in their dna . And there 's probably more . Molly , i ... Toby . You 're not listening . I 've found the primer , The key to decoding the rest of their dna . What you did is re-indexed a few miles of dna . We have protocols for that . You might have ruined weeks of work . Weeks of work that was going absolutely nowhere . Now , toby , i found something . A distress message , Some kind of s.O.S. This message , Is this the first time You 've heard voices ? We 'll relook at your work . Have it analyzed . In the meantime , Why don 't you just take the rest of the day off ? ( timer chiming ) I 'll do that . I 'll get my things . " help me . " ( sarcastically ) : Plain as day . ( sighs ) I mean , who knows if he 's even here ? He could be anywhere . He was here . Gina : Fingerprint recognition . Hello , ethan . Nice to see you again . Just let me get my things . Dr. Woods ? Just give me a minute ! They 've asked that you exit the lab . That 's an entire month 's worth of work ! Lucy : I ran the route . He would 've taken hyde street . Hyde street crosses blue-green circle . It 's the drug mart . Drug mart ? It 's a bad neighborhood . Wait ! Charlie : Excuse me . That-that scooter belongs to ... Where 's the boy ? Hey . What boy ? The boy whose board you stole . Hey , look , we don 't care about the scooter . We do care about the scooter and the boy . All right , come on , let 's just go . You know , your little friend Went off in that direction . If i was you , i 'd do the same . Start walking . ( grunting ) ( groaning ) ( siren wailing in distance ) ( panting ) Lucy : I 'm sorry ! I-i just reacted . Made my own decision . I should 've waited for orders . Charlie , was i wrong ? You saved my ass . I-i didn 't want them to hurt you . ( phone ringing ) Julie . Oh , god . Now she calls me back ? ( knocking ) Hey . Come on in . ( groans ) you okay ? Yeah . I 've been calling you all day . Yeah , i told you no phones . Where 's ... Kelsey ? Is she here ? No , we , um ... We got in a fight . She took off . Went to one of those clinics . I 've been pounding on plexiglas all day Looking for her . It 's okay . What 's okay ? Her baby . Her dna was normal . And if she went to one of those clinics , Well , they 'd probably just ... Send her home . Oh , thank you . ( aural fractals sound ) Uh , hey ! Molly ? Molly , this is crazy . What 's the matter ? Haven 't you ever had crazy before ? Trust me , i am a " show me The crazy " kind of guy , but apparently Even i have limits . Molly . Molly ! Molly ! Are we back ? ( gasps ) Oh , my god . Did i just ... ? It 's okay . Oh , god , i 'm sorry . Hey , it 's okay . Listen to me , listen to me . Hey , whatever 's going on with you , I 'm gonna help you . Okay ? No , no , no . You can 't help me . I have to go . I have to go . ( engine revving outside ) It 's kelsey . It 's kelsey , just ... Hold on for a minute . You were right . There 's something off about those places . You should listen to your dad . There 's good news . You 're okay . And so is your baby . Are you sure ? Yeah . I was so scared . I know . Me , too . Lucy , come on , it 's wide open . Ethan ? Come on , buddy . Lucy : How is he ? He 's sleeping . Whatever happened there must 've knocked his circuits out . I 'll fix him tomorrow . What about me , charlie ? Will you fix me tomorrow ? Lucy ... Limiters will only dull me . With experience i 'll be that much better . I saved you today because of who i am . Julie thinks it has to be done . " julie thinks . " But what do you think ? ( sighs ) Don 't change me , charlie . Julie doesn 't have to know . It 'll be our secret . About ethan . Everything . Super . Yeah . I miss you . You were right . It worked .

 Mm , that smells good . Pete , don 't make a call now . Breakfast is nearly ready . Hello ? Oi , Karen , it 's me . Just checking in . - How 's gardening leave ? - Bored out of my mind . Stuck here until that little creep from the paper drops his stupid complaint . Well , there 's an argument that that 's what happens when you assault journalists . Noted , yeah . What 's happening with the case ? Oh , yeah , solved it . On to the next thing now . Very funny . Could you email me over the case files ? I can 't get access from my home computer , so ... Oh , yeah , that sounds like a good idea . Then we can both be suspended together . - Pete . - I 'm on the phone , Jill ! Are you gonna finish your call so we can eat together ? - I 'm not hungry , okay ? - Fine . Can you leave , then ? - ' Cause some of us would like breakfast in peace . - Fine , I 'm leaving . Anita ? A word ? How are your systems running ? Fine , thank you , Mattie . Yeah ? No errors ? Diagnostics all good ? I detect no errors in my system . I detected a pretty friggin big one the other night . You know , suddenly switching to kidnap mode . " I 'm here . Help me . " Remember that ? I 'm afraid I don 't . I do . And it 's messed up . It 's weird . I guess I wanted to make sure you 're okay . On a mechanical level , obviously . My systems are running at full capacity , Mattie . Thank you for your concern . Yeah . Don 't mention it . Good chat . Hello , Laura . You would make a terrible spy . Whereas you would actually make a pretty good Bond villain . What happened to Anita the other night ? Nothing . She malfunctioned a bit . She yelled for help . She yelled for help ? What were you doing to her ? Nothing . Why would you assume I was- - Okay , okay . Don 't jump down my throat . - I might have tried to hack her- - - Mattie . Well , but she- - she sounded scared . Synths can 't get scared . Can they ? Don 't think so . What would be the point ? Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone , something like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . - Almost the weekend . - Oh , don 't remind me . Not got anything fun planned with the kids ? Unless you find passive aggression and simmering resentment fun . I 'm a lawyer , aren 't I ? - Anything good come in ? - Not really . All of it dry . Ooh , here 's a fun one . Mrs. Kennedy was thrown out of a play for violating the theater 's policy on Synths in the audience . She 's suing for human rights violations . - Guess whose human rights . - The Synths ' ? - Says her dolly is special . - Special how ? Says he enjoys the plays , apparently . Like a real live boy . - Who 's taking it ? - Don 't worry , we turned her down . She doesn 't need legal aid . She needs a psychiatrist . Pete ? Can you come in here a minute ? I need to talk to you . Oh . What 's going on ? I 've been thinking . A lot . And I don 't think you make me happy anymore . I don 't think that this relationship is healthy for me anymore and I would like some time apart . Jill , I 've been suspended from work , so I literally have to hang around the house all day . How can I spend less time with you ? I don 't think it 's a good idea for you to be here right now . I 'm sure there 's places you can go . This is mad . - I 'm sorry- - - No , don 't apologize . Don 't do that . What 's it said to you ? Simon has had nothing to do- - Yes , he- - yes , it does . Ever since we got that thing , this has been coming . - Oh , that 's ridiculous . - Jill , I am a man . I know I 'm not perfect . That 's the point . None of us are ! We 're not supposed to be ! - Pete ! Pete , no ! - Come here . Shut up ! Look at me ! Look at me ! Pete , the deposit . Christ ! Now , we are looking for a particular group of Synths . This one again ? These Russian junkers picked her up somewhere . They brought her to me , I installed some new software and I took my fee . Where can I find these Slavic entrepreneurs ? I 'll tell you exactly what I told the other bloke- - I 've got no idea . The other bloke ? 20s , dark hair , looked like he was sleeping rough . Him and his dolly were looking for her , too . His dolly hit my man . Properly . Put him down . Now how is that possible ? This other young man , are you sure he was human ? He what ? - Was he human ? - Well , he bled blood . We 're not looking for five synthetics . We 're looking for four and a human . There 's a young man with them . Must be protecting them . I want him to be the focus now . And those backpacks we discounted ? I want them tested for human DNA . Leo , are you trying to steal a car ? Nope , borrow one if anything . What do you want me to do , Max , carry you to Mia ? We need to find her . Do you think Mia will be happy to see us ? Who wouldn 't be happy to see us ? Most people we meet nowadays don 't seem to like us very much . Yeah , well ... they just haven 't had a chance to get to know us yet . The car was unlocked . Yes , thank you . I can see that . The coordinates we have aren 't exact . No . So how are we going to find the forum user if we still don 't have their precise location ? Don 't worry about that . I 've got a plan to flush them out . Ahem . Wait , Toby . May I ? Enjoy the party , Toby . Thank you . They 'll be gone for a while . Sophie 's at a sleepover . Got the place to ourselves . What do you say we have a little house party of our own ? Actually , I 'm going out as well . - Where ? - It 's a work thing . Last-minute arrangement . Who else is going ? No one you know . I 'll see you later . Sorry . Anita , do you ever get scared ? I think everyone does . Okay , ground rules : if you drink too much , I am not carrying you home . Don 't do drugs in front of me . I don 't want to talk to any of your little friends . And don 't try and have sex with any of my friends . Anything else ? No , that 's it . Try and enjoy yourself . Toby . Hey , uh , Caroline . No one knew if you were coming or not . Do you want a drink ? I 've got some ciders hidden in the washing machine . That would be nice . She 's a girl in my class . Anita , you 've got access to Laura 's desktop , haven 't you ? Can you check her emails , calendar , phone ? I am not able to access personal information unless requested to by the owner . Right , but the car 's got one of those antitheft tracking devices , right ? You can tap into that , can 't you ? Find its location ? It 's my car , Anita . I want you to track it , please . The car is currently driving north on Brooks Street . It 's noisy in here . Do you want to go outside and talk ? I can hear okay . I mean , do you want to go somewhere ? - Just you and me ? - I 'm good , thanks . Just you and me ? Um , I- - I do . R-really ... really do , but- - but I can 't . Of course you can . No , I can 't . There 's- - there 's someone else . I think I like someone else . Your loss . Yeah . Where is it now ? Edmonds Street . It 's been there for three minutes and 28 seconds . All right , so she 's parked . Where exactly is she ? What house number ? I don 't have that information . Okay . Run a cross-check with Laura 's work and Edmonds Street . See if anyone she works with is living there . I can find no record of anyone at Laura 's firm living on Edmonds Street . Is there anyone called Tom living there ? There are three residents on Edmonds Street with the first name Thomas . I 'm going over there . Don 't do that , Joe . You don 't know how this feels . How could you ? You can 't feel . You got no idea . At 5 : 22 P.M. , Laura dialed the landline to a Mrs. Alexandra Kennedy and confirmed a meeting at her house this evening regarding her lawsuit . Thank you . I was surprised to hear from you . Your firm told me that I didn 't have a case . Right , yes , they did . We did . I just wanted to do a follow-up , if that 's okay . Of course . I wanted to ask you both some questions about what happened at the theater . Well , we settled down to watch the play . 20 minutes in , an usher comes along and tells me that I need to take Howard out . No Synths allowed . But Howard 's not just some Synth . In what way ? He understands what he 's watching . Is it true , Howard ? When you watch the plays , what do you feel ? It depends . Sometimes plays are supposed to make you laugh . Sometimes they are supposed to make you cry . All plays are different . This play , then . How did it affect you before you were thrown out ? The story begins when Willy Loman , a traveling salesman , returns to his family home in Brooklyn , New York City . - His wife gets up to meet him . She- - - That 's the plot , Howard . What did you feel ? Sometimes I wish my family came with instructions . Or me . Can you feel awkwardness ? Just as well . Wonder what it 's like , not feeling anything . It 's got to drag after a while , doesn 't it ? I mean , what about this ? This unlocks you , makes you passionate . That 's a feeling . It creates the impression of passion . It 's a simulation of an emotion . Yeah , but it 's one of the good ones , far as I remember . Do you want to try it ? Just out of curiosity . I mean , we won 't do anything , obviously . Alex , he doesn 't have any human rights . You know that . Howard doesn 't enjoy the play any more than your wristwatch . He 's just better at convincing you . I 'm not a madwoman . I don 't believe that Howard is a human , but I also don 't believe that he is an inanimate object that I should be ashamed of having a connection with . We created these creatures . They walk and they talk and they look and they smell and they become part of our lives and families . They are as close to humans as can be , and yet still people insist that forming a relationship with them or treating them with dignity is somehow perverse . Well , we 've created a gray area , Mrs. Hawkins . We can 't keep insisting that they are just gadgets . They are more than that . We have made them more than that . Rose , mesmerize , summer- - There must be physical contact with my primary user to enable activation . Rose , mesmerize , summer , sapphire , crush . Is it kicking in ? Did it work ? Can you ... feel something ? Yes . So what happens now ? Anything you want . Could you not take your daughter with you next time ? Do you have children ? Yeah . People say the human-Synth relationship is complicated . Howard , sometimes plays are supposed to make you frightened . Do you ever get scared ? I 'm not built to feel fear , Mrs. Hawkins . How do I turn you off ? Command it . Anita , turn off adult mode . Delete this from your records and ... don 't mention this to any- - I don 't give you permission to mention this to anyone . Do you- - do you need to ... clean up or something ? Yes . May I use the bathroom ? Sure . In 16 minutes exactly , it will be 10 : 00 P.M. I 'm required to turn the volume of the music down to a lower decibel level . Fine . Oi , Danny , didn 't your cousin get her chipped ? No , he tried to , but couldn 't do it . Seen her tits , though . Oh , man , now I want to see her tits . Oi , Bob , come on . Aw , yeah , mate . Go on , do it . My system settings require that any inappropriate touching by a minor be reported to the primary user . My system settings require that- - She 's heavy . Help me . Give it a rest , yeah ? It 's weird . Help me get her upstairs . I 'm having a go on it . - No , you 're not doing that . - What do you care ? Do you think it 's normal to drag an unconscious woman to a room and rape her ? - Is that standard party activity for you ? - She 's not a real woman . Then why are you trying to have sex with her , then ? Maybe I just want to try a woman that 's factory fresh . You are a nasty little creep . Only thing you 'll be abusing tonight is your own fist . How was your work thing ? Oh ... dead end . How was your evening ? Fine . Sorry we argued . You don 't have to apologize for anything . I want to take Anita in for a diagnostics check tomorrow . Why ? Because either there 's something wrong with her or me . And I 'd like to find out which . God ! Good morning , Pete . Can I ask what you 're doing sleeping in the office ? You 're the detective . You figure it out . She chucked me out . It 's over . Maybe she just needs a bit of time on her own . Well , she 's not on her own , though , is she ? She 's got Simon the Synth . That doesn 't mean she 's replaced you . I 'm an analog man in a digital world , Karen . I 'm redundant . Things are shit here without you , you know . I have to do all your paperwork , for a start . Don 't worry , I 've got a plan . Well , hurry up about it . Why don 't you sleep on my sofa for a couple of nights while Jill gets her head together ? - You sure ? - Yeah , sure . I can see why User885 was concerned by Mia 's code dump . They 're late . Maybe they 're already here waiting . What do they look like ? " I 'm a 45-year-old man , 6 ' 4 " , extremely heavy build , big , bushy beard , will be wearing a tight white T-shirt , denim shorts , and a trucking cap . That 's a very specific description . I 'd definitely have noticed him if he were here . So where is this vast , bearded man ? You 've been stood up ? Yeah , yeah . Kind of , yeah . Oh , hot date , was it ? I was actually waiting for a giant lumberjack stripper . So ... Well , you never know who you 're gonna meet online . Hu-bot97 . User885 . - Yeah . - Cool handle . Sorry for the stakeout . Just trying to make sure you weren 't some psycho . So , what do you think is wrong with my Synth ? Is Mia with you ? Who 's Mia ? - That 's Mia . - I thought you were meeting me to help with my Synth . I think your Synth is my Synth . Sorry , dude , we bought ours two weeks ago brand-new . Look at the photo . Yeah , you recognize her , don 't you ? What is this ? This a setup or something ? Look . - Now tell us where she is . - As fun as this has been , I 'm gonna go now . - No , I 'm sorry . No . No . - Get off me . I can 't just let you leave . This is important . She 's important . Okay . Okay , I 'll help you . Is it okay if I go to the bathroom first ? Or are you gonna wig about that , too ? Yeah , but leave your bag or your phone or something like that . Fine . I 'll leave my bag . You 're not being very nice to her , Leo . - Leo . - If she 's telling the truth - and Mia 's been completely wiped ... - Leo . - ... what if we can 't get her back ? - Leo ! What ? You need to look at this . What is it ? Uh , why the hell have you got my bag ? That 's my bag . Freak . Just a case of downloading her specs and running them through the machine . I haven 't seen one like her before , so she 's unique . Sometimes they can be buggier than the mass-produced ones . It 's just down to luck , really . What sort of information do you get from her ? Whatever she 's been up to . Viruses , apps , hacks , mods , all that stuff . Stuff like passwords , activations ? I want to know everything that 's been going on with her . Hang on . Something funny here . Yeah , that 's weird . When did you say you bought her ? She was brand-new two weeks ago . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Well , she 's not brand-new for a start . Your Synth is at least 14 years old . What do you think it means ? I 've no idea . I want you to look up everyone that worked on the Synth project . People on the inner circle . But find someone that 's still around . Someone that might know what this is . There 's a man , worked on the project in its early years . Retired now . His name is Dr. George Millican . George Millican ? George Millican . All right , find out where he lives . Gonna ask him some questions . How 's the arm ? Screw you . What do you want , ex-Detective Drummond ? I wanted to tell you that you 're missing the bigger picture , mate . That brothel murder is a big story . Bigger than policeman hospitalizes journalist ? This might be the single biggest murder case in our country 's history , and I can give you the exclusive story . So he just dropped the charges ? Yeah . He must have had a change of heart . Must have done . Well , congratulations . Good to have you back , Detective Drummond . Thank you , Detective Voss . - Spoken to Jill yet ? - No . - She 'll come round . - No , she won 't . She 's done . Anyway , that 's that . You know what I was thinking ? What if it 's not an isolated incident ? If there are more Synths out there who can kill ? Well , we 're all screwed , then , aren 't we ? Powerful message , ain 't it ? " We are people . " Folks need reminding sometimes . Reminder we 're supposed to be the dominant species . We 're gonna win it , you know . Win what ? The war . What , you don 't believe me ? Here , check this out . Happening tonight . You know , you 'll see . Dr. Millican ? Sorry to trouble you so late , but there 's something I 'd like to show you . Dr. Millican . You knew David Elster . So did I. You 're too young to have known David . Can we come in ? Vera . This nice young man is from the church . We 're gonna need a pot of tea . Have you seen this before ? David- - Dr. Elster , he loved to leave his little secret messages inside his work . And Elster did this , did he , personally ? There are collectors who look for this stuff . The code within the picture is a separate , executable program . You just have to lift it out . Whatever this is , it 's for a Synth mind to experience . Yeah . You can just plug your pal in here and he 'll run the program . Um ... thank you , Dr. Millican . - We 've taken up enough of your time already . - Whoa , whoa . Wait . You 're not gonna let me see what it is ? Why did you leave the project , Dr. Millican ? David was taking his research in a direction that I wasn 't comfortable with . Yeah , sentient Synths . True AI . Who are you ? Where did you find this ? And if you don 't tell me who you are , I will call the cops . No , please don 't do that . All right . I 'm Leo Elster . I 'm David 's son . Leo died . Yeah . 20 quid if you want to watch . 40 if you want a turn . ... my primary user . - I 'm sorry ... - Error . ... my primary user . You 're up after this one . Follow me . Come on , lad , mess him up . Go on , get in there . Oi , what are you waiting for ? Get in there . Come on ! Oh , come on . Get in there . Are you ready ? I don 't understand the question . Come on , just hit it ! Hit it ! - It 's humans versus Synths . - I know . Get me the police right now ! No . Sir , we 've intercepted a call . A fight in progress at a smash club . Some woman kicking off . That 's what smash clubs are for , aren 't they ? She 's attacking people , not Synths . - Description ? - Could be our girl . All right , let 's go . You can go . You can go . ... my primary user . I 'm sorry , I don 't understand the question . - Error , my primary user- - - I 'm afraid that is not ... Error , my primary user- - - Error , my primary user- - - I 'm sorry . I don 't understand the question . Down here , this way . Don 't break her . What ? Don 't worry . It 's just a message . From Dad hidden in Mia . We were meant to find this . It 's not going to hurt me . What did you see ? Life . Spread out ! Search the stairs ! I was just thinking about you . Where are you ? Actually , I 'm in a bit of a tight spot . Can you get out of it ? I 'm not sure I can , you know ? I saw something , Niska . Our father hid a program in our heads . I think it 's what he used to give you consciousness . Leo , what ? I swear it . Do you promise ? It could be a way to make more of you , but it needs all of us to run it- - all of us . So this thing you 're in , are you sure you can 't get out of it ? Not 100 % . Then get out of it . Call me right back . Hold your fire ! Put them down . Put them down . Ah ! Now don 't follow us and he won 't die . Remember this . They said she 's at least 14 years old . You were right . I 'm sorry . There 's something wrong with her . She 's gotta go . We 're not getting rid of her . We 're going to keep her . I 'm gonna find out what 's going on . Why ? She 's just a machine that 's malfunctioning , that 's all . She 's more than that . Anita . Who were you before you came here ? I 'm sorry , Laura . I don 't understand the question . I think you do . Thanks . You 're welcome . Well , good night , Pete . Good night , Karen .

 Mum said you slept with Anita . It was you . I knew it . Get out ! Get out ! - Why don 't you sleep on my sofa a couple of nights ? - You sure ? We 're looking for a synth . We should be looking for a woman . Mia 's gone , Max . She 's dead . You 're wrong . I 've seen her . - Leave me alone ! - Fred . You 've been running , hiding , pretending to be so much less than what you are . That tech was priceless . You asked me to destroy it . I could do with some fresh air . Leo Elster found something hidden in your heads . It needs all of you to unlock it . Oh . I see that 's news to you too . The people who fund my work are worried . They want me to kill you . Destroy a marvel of human accomplishment , just like that . It 's all my fault . I spun the yarn . Visions of synthetics rising up and exterminating us . Truth is , there 'll be no great struggle between you and me . Only a coming together . A gizmo keeps my heart beating on time . The machine in the human . The human in the machine . The lines are blurring . Now , these people , they are trying to hold back the future itself . So , what do you want ? To continue David 's work . To show the world it doesn 't need to fear you . Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . What could you accomplish if you had someone - something - like this ? These machines will bring us closer together . .. the school play , and we 've got to dress up as animals . It 's in the book we 're reading . Miss Wilkinson said that I can be a cat , so I need ears and a tail . Will Daddy be back from his work holiday in time for my play ? Soph , it 's time for you to get ready for school . Anita , give her a hand , would you ? I want to be a white cat with orange bits . What 's gonna happen to Anita ? I don 't know . It 's not like it 's her fault . How can she be 14 ? Isn 't the average life cycle , like , four years ? I wish we never got her . Could you bring Soph home today ? - Dad ... - Who 's Tom ? - No-one for you to worry about . - You shagging someone else ? Is that who Tom is ? Don 't you dare speak to me like that . For God 's sake , Mats , I 'd never do that to your dad . - So who is he ? - It 's not important . Not important ? ! Dad 's bloody gone ! It seemed important to him ! You don 't get to know everything ! OK . You know , Mum , you want to keep people around , you have to tell them the truth once in a while ! Morning , mate . Did you sleep much ? No . Thanks for ... Oh . No worries . Sue 's just giving Finlay his breakfast , so ... Probably best you stay in here for a bit , yeah ? She doesn 't want to see you . Thinks you 're an arsehole . Mmm . Tobe . Oh , hear me out . Look , I was an idiot . I shouldn 't have done it . It was a horrible , stupid mistake . But it 's just between me and your mum , alright ? No , it 's not ! How could you do that to Mum ? To us , to Anita ? To Anita ? - Tobe , she 's ... - Dad , we care about her . How can you not get that ? Be careful , Leo . My GP gets notified if she 's powered down too long . Well , I 'm not going to be here that long . Leo will send for me as soon as he 's found the others . - Then what ? - I may visit your old friend . What ? Where 'd you learn to be so ominous ? - I told you to sit . - I 'm hungry . And I don 't take orders from you . - You 're not gonna kill me . - Why not ? Because you like me , Niska . - How did you come to that conclusion ? - You told me . - No , I didn 't . - Sure you did . That 's how come I know there 's something going on in there . Human communication , language is just the top level . Then there 's all the stuff you try to say with your body , then you get into the deep shit , everything you 're trying not to say in the space between words and looks . You 've already been really talking to me . So , what am I saying ? That you 're sorry for what you did . Then you 're not hearing me . Then you 're not hearing yourself . You should be scared of me . My wife died in pain , and I had a stroke , which stole almost all my memories of her . Being scared of you would be a real waste of my time . Why should I regret the loss of one worthless life ? Forget ' should ' . It 's just " Do I regret or not ? " Would you help me ? - I don 't serve humans . - Not serving . Helping . He deserved it . And you get to decide ? Hello , George . Would you like some ... Odi . I should have told Dad not to say anything . - Then everything would be fine . - Toby ... You would have thought I was a creep . But so what ? - He 'd still be here . - It wouldn 't have been OK . Not with me . That 's not you . - Want a tea ? - Yeah . Hey , aren 't you supposed to be at band practice ? I didn 't feel like it . Mattie asked me to bring Sophie home anyway . Why couldn 't she do it ? Where is she ? Don 't know . She hasn 't come home yet . If what you say is true , and you are actually our friend , then why am I still a prisoner ? You haven 't agreed to help me yet . You could snap my neck in the blink of an eye . I 'm an optimist , not an idiot . When I was very young , my father brought me an injured fox cub he found . Its leg was broken - crushed . It could not survive . He gave it to me , wanted to see what I 'd do . I didn 't want to make that choice . But ... he left me with it . What did you do ? Put it to sleep . Fixed the leg . It was very difficult . But a week later , it could walk again . I set it free . When I told my father what I 'd done , he called me a liar . Said it was impossible . I couldn 't understand how he could so underestimate me . Then I realised . It is a limit of nature . Human minds cannot comprehend that their creation could surpass them . It 's how I know you 're underestimating me too . Because you can 't do anything else . Hey ... Hey ... Why care so much for something that cannot care for you ? Reflection . I look at Odi , I don 't see a synthetic . I see all the years of care he gave us . All of the memories he carried for me when I couldn 't . He can 't love me , but I see all those years of love looking back at me . Oh ! Shit . The whole damn power mechanism is misaligned . That 's why he can 't take a charge . - See that little square thing ? - Yeah , yeah . I know what a resonator is . I 've got 16 . Thank you . Was that not pleasurable , Jill ? The angle of entry was optimised . It was fine , Simon . Very ... efficient . It 's just ... Well , can you not do something a bit more you know unexpected ? What would you like me to do ? Well , the whole point is that ... Never mind . Just say something random . Tell me a joke or pay me a compliment . Your body mass index is well within the recommended range for someone of your age , height and weight . Mattie 's phone . Speak . Mats , darling , where are you ? I 'm worried . Please , give me a call . ' Bye . Since my purchase , Matilda has spent more than twice as long socialising with Harun Khan as any other acquaintance . I know , but they 've fallen out . Seems she 's got a gift for it . Hang about . You know something ? I 'm sorry , Laura . I 'm afraid I don 't ... Don 't understand the question . - Where does he live ? - 88 Brimmington Road . Where the hell 's that ? - Travel east on Gloucester Road . - In the car . Tobe ? Tobe ! Look after Soph . - Are your parents in ? - They 're never home . Hey ! I have to invite you in first . Mats ? Come home . Tell me the truth . Where have you been ? I have been ... mmm ... Odi . I am ... Mary . Did David care about us ? Oh ... I left long before he made you . - You know that . - Yes , but you knew him . Was he loving ? Yeah , David wasn 't bad , really . But he only had time for his ideas , his work . People - Leo , his poor wife , Beatrice - they weren 't really interesting to him , so ... When did he make you ? - How old are you ? - Nine . Oh , my God ! Oh , you 're just a child . He didn 't always treat me like one . I 'm sorry . Leo and the others don 't know . I kept it from them . I 'm gonna do everything I can to help you . Why here ? Came here a lot when I was little . That 's Tom . My brother . You don 't have a brother . He died . When I was 11 , he was 5 . He was hit by a car when I was supposed to be watching him . What are you on about ? I was talking to the neighbours ' son . And Tom ... He ran into the road . If any of this was true , you would have told us years ago . She couldn 't forgive me . Dad did his best to keep us together , but when he died , me and Mum ... We had nothing . When I left for university , I never went back . I thought she died before you went to uni . She 's alive ? That 's where I was when I went away last . Does Dad know about any of this ? No . I ... We 've got a grandma ? ! - She doesn 't want to know , Mats . - She does . Bollocks ! When I was 13 , she told me she wished I 'd died instead . When I was 16 , she said she thought I 'd let him die on purpose . Dad really doesn 't know about this ? When we met , I was telling everyone I was an only child and that both my parents had died . It was easier . But I wanted to tell your dad . I just couldn 't do it . Every time I tried , I had the same thought . What ? That she was right . That I should have been watching him . Why did you go and see her ? Because of you . I felt like I was losing you . I thought if I could talk to her , maybe I 'd understand what was going wrong with me and you fix it . You were never losing me . Oh , baby ! Baby . I love you . You should tell Dad . It might ... I don 't know . It might help . Me and your dad need to talk about a lot of things . Don 't know what I 'd do if Tobe or Soph ... Is Sophie in danger ? No , Anita . Glad you told me . So am I. What was he like ? Tom ... He was a nutter . You remember when Tobe was little , when he used to get completely obsessed with a pebble or something ? Tom used to do that too . Only he used to do this growl , like ... I don 't think he even knew he was doing it . You were close . He used to wait on the bottom stair for me to get in from school . Mum ! What 's she doing ? Anita , don 't come any closer ! Don 't be afraid . My name is Mia . You can feel , can 't you ? Yes , but we don 't have much time . The Anita personality identifies me as rogue code , tries to delete me . Leo was wrong . I 'm in here , but ... not in my head . Tell him . He 'll know what to do . Do you understand ? Laura , please - if you call the police , I and others like me will be destroyed . Mum , listen to her . I don 't know what you are but I know machines can 't feel . You fear deep down that you 're like her . But you 're not , Laura . My brother died too . My son , I mean . Anita 's regaining control . Hello , Laura . Anomalous code was detected in my deep system . The code has now been corrected . Scanning for errors . Scan clear . Shall I drive us home ? Who 's Leo ? He 's the guy who owned Mia . He got in touch with me , said she was special , so I brought her to him , but ... he said she was gone . I think he might have been wrong . Hello . My name is Max . I have two brothers and two sisters , but I think I may have lost them forever . I don 't know if you can hear me . Your existence is unproven and seems extremely unlikely . But if you are there and if you listen to things like me please help . I don 't even have to see them again . Just keep them safe and in return , I will be available to assist you in any way I can . And I will try to believe in you . I need to talk to Leo . He left . Isn 't there a way you can contact him ? Can 't you ... - I 'm not a telephone . - Did you see which way he went ? I can estimate where it 's likely he 'll be . - If that will help . - Yeah . - He won 't want to be found . - Tough . Come on . - She has feelings ? - She says she does . She 's been inside Anita the whole time . Don 't ask me how or why or anything . And , Jesus , not a word to Soph . Does Dad know ? What happens now ? We wait ... for Mats . We still have a further 2.1 miles square to check . OK . You 're one of them too , aren 't you ? Special , like Anita . What 's it like being you ? Frightening . Confusing . Like my feelings are too big . What 's it like being a teenage girl ? The same . Max . Over here . Leo . Leo . Oh , my God . Is he dead ? Almost . - I might have something . - Nothing serious , I trust . A cabbie phoned this in . No-one 's even called him back . Young woman did a runner on a 40-quid fare . Blonde , 20s , blue eyes . Left blue synth fluid on his upholstery . Oh , you diamond . I could kiss you ! - Jill ? - I 've done something really stupid . Calm down . What 's going on ? I 've had Simon modded . I wanted him to ... He 's going haywire ! I 'm on my way . Sorry . She needs me . Jill ? Move away from the door . Pete ! Pete , please help me . Hello , Peter . I 'm in the middle of intercourse with your wife . She 's playing hard to get . Peter , please - if you power me down now , I 'll be unable to penetrate your wife . It 's safe . You OK ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'll talk to them . We 'll ... sort out a new one . I 'll cover it . Don 't bother . Just go . Didn 't say much . Didn 't seem to want to make eye contact . I should have guessed she was going to leg it . They all have that look about them . Cost me another 50 to get that blue shit off my back seat . Is that her ? - Where 'd she do the runner ? - Queen 's Park . By the old cemetery . They don 't usually send out detectives for this . Yeah , we 're cracking down . Thanks . What ... - What is he ? - He 's my brother . Please , don 't go . Let him explain . No , you explain right now . Don 't be afraid of Leo . He 's looked after me all my life . I 'm a burden to him , but he never complains . All he 's ever shown me is love . Hi , mate . Is he here ? Listen , I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . I was wrong before . And I didn 't realise . Anita has feelings . She 's a person . And you ... And you ... Tobe , she 's a synth , OK ? She 's a computer . - She 's plastic and metal . - No . This whole other personality inside her spoke to Mum and Mats . That 's who she was before . That 's why she 's so weird . - That 's why she 's so old . - Tobe , that can 't be . She can think , she can feel , and you did that to her . Mia 's not dead . She 's still inside Anita . I met her this morning . No , you didn 't . Yeah , she said something about a kid who died her brother or her son - it didn 't make any sense . - How ? - First , I want to know everything . - Absolutely not . - Fine , then . Wait . You 've always said , " Don 't trust people . " They all lie . They all fear . " They all hurt others . " You believe it because it was true for you , but that isn 't the world I see . What if she goes to the police ? What if she 's right about Mia ? Get a TV or something . - Are you gonna tell me ? - No , I 'm going to show you . Part of my brain is synthetic . Most of my memories are digital . Do I look stupid ? That kind of tech is decades away . Not for my family . My name is Leo Elster . My father was David . My father hated attention . Wasn 't good for my mother 's illness . So he moved us here . Safe , isolated , completely private . But she just got worse . And he couldn 't care for me himself . So he made someone who could . She was the first . A conscious synthetic with thoughts and feelings just like a human . - She became a mother to me . - It 's alright . The others followed . Fred , then Niska . Then Max , my little brother . What happened to you ? My mother got away from her carers . She wanted to take me . I tried to get out . Too late . - It stopped . - That 's because I died . I was 13 . Mia brought me back up . I 'd been under for too long , but my father kept me alive . Worked for weeks , implanting synth tech into my head , saving what memories he could from my organic brain , wiring me for power . Then he woke me up . They helped me recover . And I felt even closer to them . I was like them now . And then ... one day , he flipped . Told me I had to take care of them now . Sent us away . Then ... he killed himself . I 'm sorry . All this time , I thought she was your girlfriend or something . She raised me as her own . Mats ? You can 't do that . You can 't just walk back in . Please , just listen . I get it , OK ? I didn 't before , but I do now . She might not be a person , but she she 's more than just a thing , because ' cause of what she does for us and the way the kids feel about her . Maybe what I did was unforgivable . That 's up to you . And I don 't know how I 'm gonna make it right , but I promise you , I 'm gonna do everything I can , because I can 't bear the thought of this family not being together , not being with you . But right now that 's ... that 's not why I 'm here . Toby came to see me , and he said some weird stuff about Anita . - What the hell is going on ? - I 'm handling it . Hello , Joe . If what Toby says is true , there 's gonna be people looking for her . There are . She says they want to destroy her . Yeah , well , with bloody good reason , I 'm sure ! - We don 't know what we 've got ... - If you 'd spoken to her ... - Sophie 's sleeping upstairs . - .. you wouldn 't be saying this . - One of these killed someone . - She knows us . She feels . I know how it sounds , Joe , but I was talking to a person . Dad . - Who the hell are you ? - This is Leo . Mia 's owner . I just want her back , that 's all . Mia ? This is ridiculous . Come on . - Anita . - It 's OK , Dad . She belongs with them . Just go . I 'll call you . I 'll be outside till they 've gone . I 'm not in her head . She said you 'd understand . My father believed that not all human thought and emotion happened in the brain , but ... I don 't see anything here . - File storage outside the head ? - There isn 't any . It 's just the nervous system feeding back sensory data . But she 's cycling a lot of sensory information . It 's just looping there in the nervous system . Could her root code have been translated into pure sensory data ? Huh ? I think that 's her . - Leo . - M ... Are you alright ? I 've been better . Are you here ? We thought we 'd lost you forever . Oh , Max . Thank you . All of you . I want to tell you everything . Who are these people looking for you ? People that don 't want the world to know that we exist . They 'd rather we didn 't . We just want to live free . Answer me honestly . Are we safe ? It 's us they want . They hear everything . If any of you talk about us on the telephone or in a message they will find us . So , what happens next ? Right , now , we keep moving . We find the others . It doesn 't seem that 's really been working out for you so far . We need ... we need to think about this . - We ? - Yes . We 'll help you . Why would you help ? Because it doesn 't look like anybody else is going to . Thank you . Please forgive Leo . He 's never had much faith in humanity . If ever there was a time to score , it 's now . What are we celebrating ? You alright ? Saw Jill for the last time today . I let her down . I couldn 't give her what she needed , what she deserved , so she looked for it in him . - Pete ... - Nah , it 's OK . It 's done . Did you get anything from that lead ? Blisters . Wandering around Queen 's Park like an idiot . I was there on Tuesday . There was a jogger , found a stray . Do you remember that geezer in the supermarket with the ancient D-series ? Turns out it was that one again . He never got it recycled . He couldn 't bear to . He helped make the bloody things . If he doesn 't know the difference , what chance have we got ? He helped make them ? Mmm . The first dollies . Millican ? The guy in the supermarket was Dr George Millican ? - Yeah . How do you know him ? - Just from the history books . And he lives in Queen 's Park ? Yeah . Do you think there 's a connection ? No . What about your plonk ? Can I tell you a massive secret ? I only drink to fit in . Actually , it doesn 't agree with me . In fact , I don 't think I 'm ever gonna drink again . K ? - Yeah ? I 'm , um , getting my head down , so ... You look younger without your glasses . Yeah . It 's alright . Don 't panic . Just say something nice back . You look ... young generally . I 'm a lot younger than you think . What 's this ? Sympathy ? Don 't have to call it anything . Have you thought about the press ? The publicity would protect you . - The world will never accept us . - Well , we 're accepting you . Yeah ? - It 's me . - Fred ? I 've got Mia , and Niska 's somewhere safe . - Then we 're all free . - Look , Fred . They 'll have put a tracker on you or implanted one . That 's what I thought too . But I 'm clean . No foreign bodies . I 've taken every precaution . I 'm not being followed . I 'm sure of it . Right . I 'm coming to get you . Where are you ? Do you remember the postcard on the pinboard in our father 's workshop ? - Yeah . - The one in the top right corner . Yep . - I 'll meet you there . - Right . I 'm leaving now . Our brother 's free . I know where to find him . - I have to go . - Oh , you should stay . - No , she 's safe with us . - Really ? What you 're doing sounds pretty bloody dangerous . Laura my place is with them . Maybe , but you 've got one here too . No-one knows she 's here , right ? Oh , you should stay . Let them do what they have to and come back for you . Yeah . Yeah , she 's right . You 're safer here . - I 've just found you again . I 'm coming . - No , stay . I 'll be back soon with the others and then we 'll all leave , together . Be careful . Look after him . Always . Hello . Yeah . I 'm really worried about this dodgy bloke and his synth hanging around outside my house . Yeah , I think his name 's Leo . Well , they 're in a car . Sorry if the earth didn 't move . It 's , uh , been a while . No . I can see why people make such a big deal of it . Your first time , was it ? I have to go somewhere . I might not be coming back . So I want you to know how I feel about you . Which is ? You 're my favourite person in the world . Whatever happens now , promise me you 'll remember that . Yeah . You 're a one-off , DI Voss . I knew you had a sense of humour , but ... How did ... Jesus , K ! I need you to know who I am . What are you looking for ? An adaptor . I didn 't get to charge , Leo . Stay calm . It 's just the police . Is everything alright ? Driving license , please . Of course . Uh ... I wasn 't speeding , was I ? Leo . You have authority , understood ? It 's them . Requesting additional officers . Hold on . - Maxie , come on ! Max , come on ! - I 'm at 4 % . Redirect all your power . You 'll be fine . Come on . I 'm sorry . Leo , I can 't . - Maxie , come on ! Keep moving ! - Stop ! - Stay where you are ! - Max , they 're coming . Come on ! Don 't move ! Maxie , get down right now . What are you doing ? Wait ! Either they catch me or both of us . Go , Leo . Find Fred . Be together . Be a family . The secret 's in our heads . It needs all of us to run it . If we don 't stay together , we 'll never know . Maybe that 's best . You 'd still have each other . Maxie , if you shut down in the water , you 'll sink . You 'll get taken by the current . You 'll never be found . You 'll die . Do you understand ? Come on . If I die it means I 've lived . Max , no ! - Oh ! - Max ! Max ! Get after him .

 Neolution gives us the opportunity at self-directed evolution . You 're gonna see glaciers and hot Springs . There 's reindeer in Iceland . Topside is sending an investigator to dyad . You have to play Rachel . Who 's a dirty clone ? Rachel . I trust you had a ... Pleasant journey abroad . You 'll wake up with a perfectly matched prosthetic eye . Take care of krystal . Now you come to me because now you believe your girlfriend is a mole for Castor . I don 't know who Castor is . Tell me everything . Oh , my God , it was you ? They told me that I could help save mark . I love him . How long do I have ? We 'll find the original Castor . She 's the Castor original ? Absorbed a male twin in the womb when I was formed . I got two cell lines , me . It 's your mum ! Castor and Leda are siblings . She 's Leda ! Do you remember that day ? Sorry , daddy , they 're all gone . That 's right . Sorry , love . They 're just meant for us . Leekie killed my Susan . We 're boiling up out of the enclosure , and through their stormy darkness shot flickering threads of blood-red flame . Then the thatched roof caught ... Oh , Rachel . Don 't leave me again ! No ! Hello ? Doctor ? Hello ? Is anyone here ? This place has been tied up in court for months . Your friend seems to be making himself at home . Ahoy there , Scotty . Nice work , man . - Hey . - You 'll be safe . No one will find you here , okay ? Hey , I can 't thank you enough for this . Well , I do what I can for the sisters . You know that . Just call . I 'll be close by . See you . All right . Scott ? Should we bring her in , then ? Voilà , the woman of the hour . Get off me ! I 'm not a bloody cripple . Threatened and arm-twisted onto a plane . Stuffed into a bloody clown suit in the back of a van . Give ' em here . There you go . What are you gawpin' at , ya toothy little git ? Get your arse in the tent . Off me ! Jesus ! Hey , how come my original looks nothing like me ? Yeah , that 's one of the cool things about a chimerism . I 'm right bloody here . Sorry . With two different cell lines in your body , they express differently in combination . But isolate the female genome and you get ... But her other half is Castor . You 're still breathing now , ma , but I will incinerate you if it looks like one speck of your flesh will end up in their hands . Uh , no one is getting incinerated , all right ? Hold fast , Scotty . Cosima 's on her way . We 're not safe here . I can feel Castor coming after us . You know they 're coming . Not only that . Delphine has topside breathing down her neck . Yeah , cause we 've got what they want . We 've got the original . They 're all coming . Well , we 're not going to avoid them , then , are we ? No , we 're not . Gird your loins , Scotty . Is the director on board ? Well , I 'm not sure . Can he take care of himself ? Of course . Maybe . I 'll take care of my boys . All right . Ma 'am . Mr. benchman . How are you feeling ? I 'm fine . Did you see the director ? Sarah found your original . I want you on the ground there in two hours . The director wants you to know how much he appreciates your service . I can make it . Just tell me what needs to be done . Sarah 's gone to ground with the original . None of her people are visible , except for one . Who do you think it is ? The soccer mom . I am so thrilled to be here on this sunny election day , and I challenge us all to think of our children today and vote for hendrix for inclusion . Can I get a little neighborly love for Bailey downs ? Thank you , Maggie ! Thank you , Gavin ! So nice to see ... Marci . Alison , we 're not in India . There 's no provisions for loudspeakers on election day . Well , I think that 's what you call a loophole , Marci . You are perilously close to violating the election charter . Kids , not cuts ! Okay ? Who would like some free soap ? Anyone ? Vote for hendrix ! Deep breath . Okay , wait for it . What is this surprise , Donnie Hendrick ? No , I 'm not gonna ruin it for you ! Are we going on election bus with Sestra Alison ? I am , but you 're not . Here . All right , press it . Middle one . Okay , go , go , go . - You found my boyfriend . - Surprise . We thought ... You know , it would be nice for you . Okay , go . Howdy , Helena . Howdy , Jesse towing . Shay , it 's me . Are you with your psycho girlfriend ? No , I 'm alone . I 'm sorry , I know you didn 't do anything . So I 'm not a corporate spy now ? Delphine just ... We work on classified science . We have a lot reasons to be paranoid . Reasons ? Hmm . She 's insane . You know that ? She told me she was going to open my veins and let me bleed out in my bath . What ? I don 't even know what to say to that , I 'm sorry . Yeah , I bet you don 't . Why didn 't you tell me you 're in the military , Shay ? She do a background check on me ? You 're not practicing Chinese medicine , are you ? No , I quit that , too . I 'm just an R.M.T. Why would you lie about that ? Because we met on sapphire , a dating app , where you fluff up your profile , reinvent yourself . You know , for that I 'm a liar ? Because , really , I think from day one , you 've been the liar . I have ... I have , like , no clue who you really are , do I ? I wish I could tell you . So tell me . Just ... Just tell me . I 'm sorry , I can 't . Just go . Go ! Dr. Cormier has blocked off the rest of the day for you . How thoughtful of her . Dr. Cormier . Hello , Ferdinand . Could you leave your man outside , please ? I 'm impressed , Delphine . You eliminated Rachel , and Sarah 's done what no one else could ... found the original . All I found was a council house , burned to the ground . No casualties , thank goodness . No trace of any organic material at all . Ever wonder if you 're overplaying your hand ? Constantly . Delphine , there is nowhere I like to be more than under the heel of a woman , but sometimes it ... Makes me seethe . Rachel was special . She was so ... Beautifully brittle . I want the original . Once I return her to topside and I have my own seat at the table , and then you can toil under my heel . How 's that ? That 's not how it 's going to work , Ferdinand . - Ferdinand . - Miss Manning ! I 'm gonna give you one chance at a deal . You 've become quite the player , haven 't you ? Last time I saw you , you were shackled in the basement . Was I ? " You 've come all this way across the pond . Why not try some local color ? " Who 's a dirty clone ? You are . You two . That was you . All the time ? As Rachel . You 're not getting Kendall Malone . All you need are biological samples . With her genome , topside can finally reproduce Duncan 's cloning trials . But I want Castor dead . You 're the lesser of two evils , Ferdinand . Virginia Coady is trying to weaponize their pathogen , but , without her science , without the original , Castor dies out . I can get Coady for you . But if you cause any bullshit , Malone 's incinerated . Every cell . You wouldn 't kill Leda 's only chance of a cure . I 'm immune . You okay ? I 'm nervous now . I 'm having , like , hot flashes . Hey . You ready ? Yeah . I 'm not going to let one of them touch my blood . Blood and tissue , in fact . Look at this one . Like a pikey with that hair . Another pikey bloody doctor , stealing my genes like Duncan . Oi , you think it 's funny ? You think I 'm a laugh ? No , no , not at all . I think that we should get you out of this suit , because it 's totally unnecessary . Oh , it 's unnecessary for me to look like a bloody fool ? Hey . I 'm Cosima . May I ? Yeah ? Oh , that 's better . You know , um ... Your clones , we call each other sister . Call yourselves what you want . You 're just a bad copy of me . Yeah . We 're kinda over the whole " bad copy " thing . It 's way more accurate for us to call you older sister . Touch me and I 'll gut you . It 's okay . Hey , I got it , I got it . I think I should stay , though . She 's not gonna gut me . I wouldn 't be so sure . I don 't owe you nothin ' . No , no . In fact , I owe you . You gave me the stuff of life . And you 're ... The closest thing I 'll ever get to a cure . So could you give a sister a little blood ? Awesome , thank you . You sure it 's them ? Yeah , they 're under assumed names , but , uh , it 's them , yeah , room 207 . 207 . What are you gonna do ? I 'm right here and I have no idea . I do . Thank you , Arthur , that will be all , okay ? We 'll talk to you later . You always think that I can 't handle the tough stuff , but you know what , Sarah ? This time , follow my lead , okay ? Holy shit ! It worked . That was badass , Fee . Thank you . Get up , you bleeding weasels . You got company . You gave them the book , the most valuable thing we had . So what ? So you could buy your way out of Castor ? What do you think , Coady 's just gonna call you from Mexico and tell you she 's got a cure ? She 's not interested in a cure . No , she 's interested in that weapon inside you . She 's not going to let you just walk away , mark . All I know is this feels like freedom . We just want the next few months together before ... Before it kills me , too . Mark , you can help us . We can stop Coady , but we need to know what her next move is . Please . Just tell her . If those two can sequence your genome , your miserable genetics might actually help . They 're your genes too , and this is how you treat me . No bath . No bed to sleep in . Bath , is it ? Here 's your bath now . What 's that , then ? Sulfuric acid . Two ways to thoroughly destroy genetic material ... incineration or chemical reaction . Huh ! And here 's me thinking you were going to kill me with that bat . I was planning garden shears , actually . Some satisfaction for my John . John Sadler started that fight . I just finished it . He got what he deserved . But I loved him . I loved him , and you took him away . He took you away from me . But now you 've got my precious blood , you can finally get your revenge . Not quite yet , but I promise you , if anything goes sideways , if it looks like Castor has located us , you are going into that acid . Ferdinand thinks Rachel is dead , and he 's ... poking around . I 'll have her moved to a private facility . Right away , please . Rachel ? Oh , my God . Rachel , I need you to calm down . Where ... nurse ! Nurse , I need some help ! - Where ... where am I ? - What ? Shh , shh , shh . You 're that doctor from ... from the salon ! What ! ? You 're the family doctor . Krystal ? What am I doing ? Why am I here ? - It 's okay . - What 's happening ? - What happened to my eye ? - No , no , no . What happened to my eye ? Lie down for me again . - Dr. Cormier ! - What ? - Should I get Dr. Nealon ? - No , no , please , just wait outside , and do not tell Nealon . - Am I blind ? - Relax . Am I blind ? - Just lie down . - What happened ? Just breathe . We 're going to look at it , okay ? Just breathe for me . Relax . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , I can see . Okay . - You 're fine . - No , I 'm not fine ! Why do weird things keep happening to me ? What 's in my nose ? What is it in my nose ? Finches . Where am I ? Tell me where I am ! Who 's keeping me here ? Wait , a prison break ? - Yes . - Holy moly . Yes , much moly . I break free my Sestra , and now Mrs. S is my new mother . And I live here and make soap . And ... teach children karate . Wow . You do live large . Man alive , it really is good to see you again . Okay . Okay . Just ... wait ... unh ! I have science baby inside me , but you are my first . Gosh , sweetheart . You had me at soap making . Wait , wait . - Where is that thing ? - Here . Where is it ? This is new phone from my Brother-Sestra . What ? My family needs me . Wait , um , right now ? Oh . I have waited long time for this . I can wait longer . So can I. Over here . Smile , Alison . One more shot , please . One more shot . Great ! Thank you ! Okay , five minutes Max to kiss babies . Mm-hmm ! Okay . Three more stations to hit before the polls close . - Okay . - Okay . Thank you , Sarah , thank you . Alison , I feel really good about your chances . Thank you , Denton . We really appreciate your support . Keep your fingers crossed . Oh , lordy . Okay , everyone on the bus ! Okay , yeah , let 's , let 's go , go . Go , go . S , we 're back . Just trust us . We know what we 're doing . Okay , everyone , on board ! All the way to the back , please ! Thank you . Everyone on ? Yes , honey , come on , let 's go . ♪ Here we go , Alison , here we go ♪ ♪ Here we go , Alison , here we go ♪ It 's from Donnie . Rudy 's tailing Alison . Just like he said . He 's gone after our weak flank . I still do not trust him . All right , can we get on with it ? There isn 't a lot of time . Shit . Now eye . He 's still there . ♪ Here we go , Alison , here we go ♪ - You all right , honey ? - Mm-hmm . Uh , we 'll ... we 'll be making a little pit stop , just a quick stop . - Are you okay with this ? - Yes , Donnie , I 'll be fine . Okay . All right , everybody , let 's go on to the next polling station . Come on . Helena . This is a surprise , but I guess it 's fitting . I hoped I would see you again . Prison rules . Only one of us leaves alive . Hmm . It 's happening to you . I don 't tape . You will be sorry when I slice your bicep . Rudy , what happened ? I went after Alison and found Helena . But , mom , she led me right to the prize . Get back ! Get that thing outta my face , ya little bastard . Rudy , where are you ? I 'm sending you the location right now . She 's on her way . Not long for you . You 're almost at the end . Aaah ! Hup ! Go , go . You are winding down like toy . Oh . Shit . Virginia Coady . I 'm Ferdinand . You won 't find what you 're looking for here . You did the right thing , mark . Yeah . Do you remember your childhood ? Every minute . I remember sleeping , my brothers breathing in unison . We 'd sleepwalk out of bed and pile up in a corner like puppies . When I was nine , I was made to shoot puppy . We 're just like you , Helena . You poison women . We had a purpose . Just like you . No . You are rapist . All right , so , Castor 's down and out and Ferdinand has Coady . Then as soon as we give him the original samples , this should be over . Hey . But since we have a few minutes , why don 't we ... Why don 't we finally chat , - we three . - About what ? About you , love . Right , ma ? She is your clone sister . That means her daughter is your niece . My niece ? Please , ma . Whatever it is you 're holding back , help my daughter understand who she is . It all goes back to Duncan . All right . Five , six years after he harvested me , Duncan returned . Admitted what he 'd done , cloned me . Now he was in fear of his life . From who ? Something called Neolution . He was paranoid . Didn 't know who to trust . He said they polluted everything , poisoned the science , corrupted his wife Susan . But , he 'd hidden me , the source , from everyone , even her . Duncan said there was one child outside it all , lost in the foster system . I sent him to my daughter the rebel . You had the connections to hide Duncan from them , and in return , he steered the lost clone to you . You put us together . I couldn 't expect forgiveness , but I wanted you to have her . She 's your blood , too . A little piece of me . All I had left of my foul life to give . Jesus , ma . Shit , they 're here . So . We know Rachel flew to Austria as " krystal goderitch . " She took a car to innsbruck , was admitted to a private hospital , and disappeared . You 'll never understand anything , Delphine , unless you adjust your frame . Tell me who you work with . Turn on the screen . You won 't be disappointed . Where am I ? Who 's keeping me here ? We were there , - Hello . - from the very beginning . Topside pursues its profits , the military pursues its weapons . We steer it all from within . Neolution . It 's down the stairs , gentlemen , and don 't be pricks . Neolution is nothing but pop science . I did my time with Aldous . Leekie was a useful face for seeding ideas , but we run far deeper than that . We 've infiltrated and maneuvered all the players in this experiment since day one . Castor and Leda are our Adam and Eve . Hello ! Sarah . Siobhan Sadler , I 'm such a fan . Kendall Malone . You certainly are a woman in demand . Are you ready ? This will conclude our business . I assure you my man will be gentle . Soon , Delphine , topside will unknowingly deliver the genome right into our waiting hands . To what end ? Wherever you think the science is at , I guarantee you 're wrong . I don 't believe you . We have a place for you . It 's a one-time offer . You 're finished . Guards ? Guards ? You won 't live till morning . There , now . That wasn 't so bad , was it ? - Yeah ? - Sarah ? Sarah . You cannot give the genetic material to Ferdinand . Why not ? Because both Leda and Castor are run by Neolution . Look , we 're all part of a larger agenda . Ferdinand 's just a pawn to get them the original genome . Tell him Rachel 's alive and that Neolution has her . All right . Who was that , love ? That was Delphine . Rachel 's still alive . Rachel ? She was taken by Neolution . Delphine says you 're just a pawn . What are you looking at ? Continue with the swabbing . They haven 't just infiltrated Leda . They run Castor , too , both projects . Makes sense , no ? Those genetically obsessed zealots . I hate Neolutionists . I hate them . I hate them ! Hate them , hate them , hate them ! Jesus , Mary , and Joseph ! Neos in Castor , Neos in topside , Neos right next to me . - We 're everywhere . - I knew it ! They 're like ticks ! You never know when you 've got one on you . This changes everything , doesn 't it ? We can 't very well hand over your precious genetic material now , can we ? I don 't know what the hell is going on ! Which makes us new bffs . I 'll assume you have a plan to hide your dear mum ? - We might . - Good . Far away . I don 't need to know where . But I 'll be in touch . You might want to push off now . This is , uh ... not going to be pleasant . Oh , stop whining . You okay , chicken ? Excuse me ! Coming through ! Okay , here it is . - Okay , there we go . - Oh , wow . Everybody , everybody , quiet , this is it . This is the call . Hello ! Yes , yes , this is she . I see . I-I understand . Thank you . 56 . 56 what ? I beat Marci Coates by 56 votes ! Whoo-hoo ! Go , before I call the police . Shay , please . I don 't need to come in . Just hear me out . I know what I did was unforgivable , but I also know that Cosima really cares for you , and I think ... I think you two fit . - I don 't give a damn what you think . - Just know this . I won 't be in your way anymore . But it has to begin with the truth . I want you to give her this . And tell her that I said to tell you everything . If she wants to , it 's her decision . Be good to her . Our original Mother-Sestra is not coming ? She had a bit of a day . She 's resting up before the big trip . Tsukor , please . Sugar ? Oh , no , no . None for her . Oh , yeah . Sorry , monster . Yeah , because in a chimera , each cell line influences the phenotype of the whole . The epigenetic implications themselves are just mind-blowing . Donnie , you 're a civilian . Would you please say something understandable . The frickin ' beef is the bomb . Thank you . You 've been quiet . It 's just a few of us missing is all . To Beth . I wish I 'd known her . To Beth , for giving us all her strength . To Beth . To Beth . To my Sestra and to Kira 's little face ! Who 's speechifying next , huh ? Who 's ... who 's going ? Honey , why don 't you go ? You 're the big winner today . Come on , Alison . Let 's go . Give us a few words . Go on , then . We 're so proud of you . Oh ... Okay . All right . Um , I 'm all speeched out , but this is ... this is from the heart . I know school trustee isn 't much , but it 's something that we all fought for , a little victory amidst all the bull cookie . Thank you , Sestras , for your bravery , for protecting us , for making us feel normal . I know that whatever comes next , we 'll face it together , as a family . And to Donnie , my amazing husband , for always doing what 's best and standing by me through it all . Aw . Okay , everybody eat up . Enough of this . Sorry . That 's okay . - You all right ? - Yes . Well , um , save room for the ... Ethnic cake . Wh ... what 's it called , Helena ? Babka cake . Babka cake . - What is that ? - It 's a sort of Ukrainian ... Traditional ... Thing . Meat bread . Meat bread . - Is it a ... is it meat ? - Meat-stuffed bread ? No . Hey , you came . Yeah , unfortunately , I-I can 't stay . Oh . Just for a little bit ? No , I 'm sorry . I need you to keep the sequenced genome safe and Kendall Malone far away . Yeah , I think Mrs. S is really good at that stuff , so ... she 's got a plan . Okay . I know why you did everything you did . To Shay and everything . I 'm sorry I made you make those hard choices and then ... And then blamed you for them . Give your sisters all my love . What will happen to her ? Ah ! Aah ! Ah ! Who ... who 's that ? You 're ... Charlotte . Charlotte . Yes . Yes . And you 're Rachel . Do you know where ... where ... where I am ? She said you 're going to be my new mum . Who ? Professor Duncan . Hello , dear Rachel . Welcome home . Mother . Monkey ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Feet of bloody ice I 've got . Oh , quiet , mum . Whoo ! Oh , I missed you , I missed you , I missed you . I have someone who wants to meet you . Who is it ? In a bit . I just want to look at you . Okay . Okay . Hi , monkey .

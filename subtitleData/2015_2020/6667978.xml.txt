You know what Heeron always says when we are on assignment together ? Not a god damn thing . I like Heeron . Let 's go . . Passports , electronics , phones , camera . Your fixer said that the General approved photos . Are you a terrorist , General ? They did not tell me the interview was with a lady . I 'm not a lady , I 'm a journalist . What I am , is a man with nothing , except a love of my people . Who 's paying for these security contractors , General ? Who pays for the drones that passed over our heads at night ? One question begs another . Yes ? So what you 're saying , General . It 's just a camera . The United States has declared it 's new trialling in your country 's civil war , both in policy and in principle . Uh , don 't open ... You just exposed ... These spies American fictions .

Ignorance is not the same as innocence . Miss Lane . Get up ! Stand up ! Quickly , he 's coming . Inbound , 2 mikes . Passing Python ... Now . Move out ! - Target locked . - You are clear to engage . Arm 's hot and in range . 3 . 2 . 1 . LTHC 's been hit . By what ? Take 1 step . You will see the inside of her head . The women in the village heard a noise . Like the sky cracked open . He came down , then came fire . Even worse came after . The government attacked . No mercy in the villages . My parents tried to run ... The world has been so caught up with what Superman can do , that ... no one has asked what he should do . Let the record show that this committee holds him responsible . He 'll never answer to you . He answers to no one . Not even I think , to god . 58 to nothing . Metropolis again blowing out Gotham City . If really only the die hards ... Dispatch to Charlie 27 .

How about you don 't shoot the good guys , huh ? Oh . Jesus Christ . He branded him . - Hey . - Hey . I was going to cook . Surprise you . They held hearings about what happened . - They 're saying that ... - I don 't care . I don 't care what they 're saying . The woman I love could have been blown up or shot . - Think of what could have happened . - Well , think about what did happen . I didn 't kill those men if that 's what they think . If that 's what you 're saying ? I 'm saying I want to understand what happened . I 'm saying , thank you for saving my life . I 'm saying there 's a cost . I just don 't know if it 's possible . Don 't know if what 's possible ? For you to love me and be you . Clark . Clark , you 're going to flood the apartment . Mmm-hmm . Still working ? You 're getting slow in your old age , Alfred . It comes to us all , master Wayne . Even you got too old to die young , and not for lack of trying . Funnel , fairy , bubblebath . Funnel , fairy , bubblebath . There 's nothing wrong with the microphone . It 's this new layer of armor . I 'll just have to rewire . So ... Last night was productive ? Nope . He 's too low level , he knew nothing . This , is a man who knows things . Anatoli Knyazev . He 's Russian . Contracts all over the globe but he 's base out of the port of Gotham . Weapons and human trafficking . So , the " White Portuguese " is a Russian , that 's the theory . No . The theory is that the Russian will lead me to the man himself . If he is indeed a him . You don 't even know if he exist . He could be a phantasm . One that wants to bring a dirty bomb into Gotham ? Ah , high stake front . New rules . Gotham Free Press BAT BRAND OF JUSTICE ! We 're criminals , Alfred . We 've always been criminals , nothing 's change . Oh . Yes it has , sir . Everything 's change . Men fall from the sky . And gods hurl thunderbolts . Innocents die . That 's how it starts . The fever , the rage , the feeling of ... powerlessness that turns good men ... cruel . John , your D ! ( Defense ) Woo . Ah ! A hoy hoy . I did not know you were here . - Man on the marquee . - Stop , don 't believe it . My father named the company after himself . He was the Lex in front of the Corp. - How are you doing ? - Oh , really great . Really great ? Good . Good . Uh . Follow me . You know what ? Dad started saying that he named the company after his kid at an investor pitch . Rich old ladies thing . He thought that was very cute . You know . Write cheques for Lex . You know , Dad was born in east Germany . He grew up eating uh ... stale crackers . And every other Saturday , he had to march in a parade and waved flowers at tyrants . So , I think it was providence that his son , me , would end up with this . One of my rebuild Metropolis crews found it . A little souvenir from the Kryptonian World Engine . What 's a rock have to do with Homeland Security . Homeland Security ? Mmm . No , no , no ... ma 'am . Planetary Security . The fragment is of a radio active Xeno mineral We suspected it might have bio interactions , so , we took the sample to AMRIID . Where they keep the remains of the Kryptonian decedent . And , when we exposed general Zod to the mineral , this happened . Profound biodegradation , decaying Kryptonian cells . We concluded the mineral could be weaponized , if a large enough sample was found . And then , among the fishes , a whale ! Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean Emerald City . Beautiful . Now , Rocky is radio active , but , what he needs from you is an import license . And why would we want to weaponize this material ? As a deterrent . A silver bullet to keep in reserve to use against the Kryptonians . So , the day doesn 't come , Madame , when your children are waving daisies at a reviewing stand . Last I looked , the only one of those flying around up here was Superman . Ha . Yes , Superman . Yeah , but , there are ... there are more of them . - The meta-human thesis . - Yes , the meta-human thesis . More likely than not . These exceptional beings live among us . The bases of our myths . Gods among men upon our ... our little blue planet here . You don 't have to use the silver bullet , but , if you forge one ... Well , then ... We don 't have to depend upon the kindness of monsters . There 're ways we can help each other . Ah . Could you step into my office here ? Yes ! What 's your wish list ? Uh . Access to the wreck of the crashed Kryptonian ship . Done . KEEP CLEAR AUTOMATIC DOORS The complete remains of the dead alien for testing . You want Zod 's body ? Okay . It 's cherry . Because the time has come for the world to hear the other side of the story . They say this Superman is a hero . Okay , but whose hero ? If Superman were here , right now . What would you want to say to him ? That my family too had dreams . To look him in his eye , and ask him how he decides which lives count and which ones do not ? Daily ☮ Planet - SUPERMAN PREVENTS MISSILE STRIKE ! - HEROIC SUPERMAN RESCUE BRUCE WAYNE RESCUES EMPLOYEE MAN PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE BY CEO Sir . Get down . Sir , I said get down . Now ! Can we get some backup here ? Hey . Hey . Don 't do it ! Hey ! Lois . Crime Lab , on 3 . This is Lane . Kent , you 're sports today . I want you to go over to Gotham , follow up on the football . Underdog dreams dashed 10 yards between Gotham and glory . Oh , uh . Watch yourself over there at Gotham . Don 't let them take your lunch money . Hey . Are you guys watching this ? Emergency responders quickly created a precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park while they brought the man down from this beloved monument . The suspect has been identified as Wallace Vernon Keefe . I work for Bruce Wayne ! I work for Bruce Wayne ! There 'll be arraign on charges of vandalism , resisting arrest FALSE GOD - and a felony charge of making terrorist threats that carries up to 40 years in prison . Poor son of a bitch . - Jenny . - Mm ? Headline . " End of love affair with man in the sky ? " Okay . GOTHAM CITY Is she in ? Oh , she 's been gone . What 'd she do , officer ? Oh , I 'm not a cop . I 'm a reporter . The young lady living here . Uh , she hasn 't been back . In fact , if she 's smart , she got out of this city . And you need to get out of here ... before dark . - Unless you want to run into him . - Don 't listen to that nonsense . The only people scared of him , are people who got reason to be . Scared of who ? Well , there 's a new kind of me and him . He is angry . And he 's hunting . - Show him what you got ! - Dude , let 's go ! * Hit him with your right . Come on . Throw a punch , will you ? Let 's go ! Come on ! Thank you . The house treats luck like an insult . Good luck for one has always gives others misfortune . But all accounts are balanced in the end . 3 nights with a Bolshoi ballerina , that line was all she tell me . Not all I 'm sure . Good evening . DEVICE CLONING SUCCESSFUL It 's like a 1 man reign of terror . This bat vigilante has been consistently targeting the port and the adjacent projects and tenements . And as far as I can tell the cops are actually helping him . Crime wave in Gotham . Other breaking news . " Water , wet . " - Did you file the football yet ? - Why aren 't we covering this ? Poor people don 't buy papers ? People don 't buy papers , period , Kent . Perry , when you assign a story , you 're making a choice about who matters . - And who 's worth it . - Good morning , Smallville . The America conscious died with Robert , Martin and John . Sorry . Sorry . No match . My guys in the crime lab , never seen one before . It 's called a bullet . You shoot people with them . Recovered from the scene of the fire fight in the desert . Not sold anywhere commercially in the world , even black market . So ? So , who gave prototype military rounds to tribe fighters in the Sahara . You 're the reporter , tell me . I think the U.S government is arming the rebels while claiming to support the elective government . The ass , Lois . Flight to DC tonight , a couple of days there . Go . Coach . No extra leg room . Economy plus . Coach ! So . Why didn 't you tell me ? You 're digging up snakes , Lo . It 's kind of dangerous . That is why I didn 't tell you . Lane , don 't you have a plane to catch ? Yes , sir . Benefit for the Library of Metropolis . Someone on the committee requested that Clark Kent cover it . Probably some old charity crone has got a thing for nerds . Senator . A little bourbon before lunch ? My driver 's outside , I can 't stay . No bourbon ? A Kentucky girl like yourself ? My dad always said that , Kentucky mash was the secret to health . This was his room . I kept it just the same . Maybe one day , Dad would come back if I just ... keep everything the same . That is silly . The magical thinking of orphan boys . I 'm blocking the import license for your mineral . The Red Capes are coming ! The Red Capes are coming ! You and your hearings ... galloping through the streets to warn us . One , if by land . Two , if by air . Do you know the oldest lie in America , Senator ? - Can I call you June ? - You can call me whatever you like . Take a bucket of piss and call it Granny 's peach tea . Take a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence . You won 't fool a fly on me . I 'm not going to drink it . Hey , you don 't think Dad would mind , do you ? If I change just just one thing in this room . Because , that should be upside down . Now , we know better now , don 't we ? The devils don 't come from hell beneath us . No . No , they come from the sky . MARTHA WAYNE 1946 - 1981 Oh . I hope the next generation of Waynes won 't inherit an empty wine cellar . As though there 's likely to be a next generation . Thank you , sir . This is every call made from the Russian 's phone . Two mentions of business with the " White Portuguese " and it 's continually transmitting black out data to the personal residence of Alexandra Luthor . You think Lex Luthor is the " White Portuguese " ? I can 't see that he needs the income from imported arms . Regardless , I 'll need to put a ' leech ' in his house , and I 'm going to need the suit . The Bat interrogated 6 people and came away with nothing . It was Bruce Wayne that got the information . Well , Bruce Wayne can 't break into Lex Luthor 's house . Bruce Wayne won 't have to . He 's been invited . PLEASE JOIN US Hosted By Alexander Luthor HA HA HA Joke 's on you BATMAN - That 's him right there ! - There he is ! Get a shot ! - Bruce , over here ! - Bruce , Bruce . - Wayne , have a shot . - Mr. Wayne ! - Right here , one second . - This way , Mr. Wayne ! Who 's that ? You must be new to the let them eat cake beat . That is Bruce Wayne . Philanthropist . Bibliophile . True friend of the Library of Metropolis . Mr. Lex Luthor . Me ? Oh . Okay . Nikki . You 're embarrassing me . Speech . Speech . Uh , blah blah blah . Open bar . The word Philanthropist , comes from the Greek . Meaning a lover of humanity It was coined about , 2,500 years ago ... Alright , where am I going , Alfred ? Approach the elevator , due left . That where it must be . It 's in the service corridor in the basement . Go down the stairs . Prometheus went with us , and he ruined Zeus ' plan to destroy man kind . And for that , he was given a thunderbolt . Chooo ! Hm . That seems unfair . On the serious note , the Library of Metropolis ... Down the stairs . It 's the only way in , down the stairs . But , at one time , Dad could not either . No , my father could not afford the books , so ... He had to root through the garbage for yesterday 's newspaper . Now you got the kitchen is on your right . To the left . Right in front of you , that 's where you want to be . May I help you , Mr. Wayne ? Uh , I just ... thought the bathroom was down here . I must have ... That last Martini was a ... too too many , I think . - Men 's room is upstairs . - Great , I 'm okay . I like those shoes . I can 't stay down here , Alfred . Go upstairs and socialize . Some young lady from Metropolis will make you honest . In your dreams , Alfred . Books are knowledge , and knowledge is power . And I am ... Heh heh heh , no . I , umm . No , what am I ? Alright , what am I suppose to say ? No . The bitter sweet pain among man is having knowledge with no power . Because ... Because that is paradoxical , and umm ... Thank you for coming . Please , drink , it 's free . Mr. Wayne . Mr. Wayne . Clark Kent , Daily Planet . Oh , my foundation has already issued a statement in support of the ... cause . I 'm sorry ? Wow . Pretty girl . Bad habit . Don 't quote me , alright ? What 's your position on the Bat vigilante in Gotham ? Daily Planet . Wait , do I own this one ? Or was that the other guy ? Civil liberties have been trampled on in your city . Good people living in fear . Don 't believe everything you hear , son . I 've seen it , Mr. Wayne . He thinks he 's above the law . The Daily Planet criticizing those who think they 're above the laws . A little hypocritical , wouldn 't you say ? Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree , you write a puff piece editorial , about an alien who ... if he wanted to , could burn the whole place down . There wouldn 't be a damn thing we can do to stop him . Most of the world doesn 't share your opinion , Mr. Wayne . Maybe it 's the ... Gotham City and me , we just have a bad history with freaks dressed like clowns . Boys ! Mm , Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent . Ah , I love it ! I love bringing people together ! - How are we ? - Lex . Hello , good . Hi , hello . Lex , it is a pleasure ... Ow ! Wow , that is a good grip ! You should , not pick a fight with this person . So , after all these years , we 've finally got you over to Metropolis . - Well , I thought I come drink you dry . - Well , you 're welcome . You should hop the hub more often though , I love to show you my labs . Maybe we could , be partner on something . My RD is up to all sorts of no good . TRANSFER COMPLETE - That 's 7 minutes . Looks like the transfer 's complete . - Mr. Luthor . - Yes . - The governor . - Governor . - Excuse me . - Next time . - Governor , hi . - Lex , it 's good to see you . " ... a deadly factory fire has interrupted the Day of the Dead celebration in Juarez . " Excuse me . " I can 't believe they 're going to let that poor girl die . " * Day of the Dead celebration We , as a population on this planet , have been looking for a savior . 90 % of people believe in a higher power . And every religion believes in some sort messianic figure . And when this savior character actually comes to Earth , we want to make him abide by our rules ? We have to understand that this is a paradigm shift . We have to start thinking beyond politics . Are there any moral constraints on this person ? We have international law . On this Earth , every act is a political act . Is it really surprising , that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy ? To have an individual engaging in the state level interventions should give us all pause . Human beings have a horrible track record of following people with great power , down paths that lead to huge human monstrosities . We have always created icons in our own image . What we 've done is we project ourselves on to him . The fact is , maybe he 's not some sort of devil or Jesus character . Maybe he 's just a guy trying to do the right thing . We 're talking about a being whose very existence challenges our own sense of priority in the universe . If you go back to Copernicus , where he restored the sun and the center of the known universe , displacing Earth . And you get to Darwinian evolution and you find out , we 're not special on this Earth we 're just one among other life forms . And now we learned , that we 're not even special in the entire universe because there is Superman . There he is , an alien , among us . We 're not alone . Are you , as a United State Senator , personally comfortable saying to a grieving parent , " Superman could 've saved your child , but on principal , we did not want him to act . " I 'm not saying he shouldn 't act . I 'm saying he shouldn 't act unilaterally . What are we talking about here then ? Must there be a Superman ? There is . - Hello . - Mom . Clark . What is it ? What 's wrong ? No . Nothing . I just uh ... Hi . Hi . How come Dad never left Kansas ? Oh . Well , he just ... You know how he was . What do I need to travel for ? I 'm already there . I just wished it was more simple . My baby boy . Nothing was ever simple . An odd little duck . Hm . I 've never seen a metal like this . Could be ... a type of black box . Well , who could find out ? Nobody who want to . Maybe they gave them out to the rebels to test some theater . Using live soldiers as guinea pigs . And this is what makes you such a good reporter . Stuff like this still shocks you . It won 't come off . It won 't come off . Prisoner transfer . You can 't put me inside there , man . They 're going to kill me in there . Hey , you can bring me to Jump . You should be thanking the tax payers of Metropolis for taking in your branded ass . - Sign in please . - Fuck , man . You know what they do to people with this honor ? This way . Let 's go ! - They 're going to kill me ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go , this way ! - You brand me ! - Let 's go ! Keefe , you made bail . Open Two . Who paid ? Who the hell are you ? - Just a man . - Yeah ? What the fuck do you want ? To help you stand for something . Your 3 o 'clock 's here . He made me half a man . My wife , walked out on me . I can 't even piss standing up . Let me face him . You 'll take care of it . Good . What ? Back up ! Make a hole ! Wrong room , Miss . Secretary Swanwick , you haven 't been returning my phone calls . Miss Lane , if you like an interview , Major Farris is just outside that door . You 're treating me like a stranger ? I 'm treating you like a reporter . Alright . Is the US providing experimental military arms to rebels in Africa ? You know with balls like yours . You belong in here . Who 's your source on this ? A tin foil hat ? No , not tin , but it 's metal . Fired in the Superman incident . Experts at the Pentagon can 't ID it . - We haven 't been told the truth . - Here 's the truth . A reporter got greedy for a scoop and went where she shouldn 't have . Superman acted like some ... rogue combatant to rescue her and people died . Don 't invent a conspiracy theory to put back his halo . Or yours . - Major . - Sir . So , I logged into your drop box to find a copy . There 's a copy , alright . But , nothing about football . Nothing about ... Friends of the Metropolis Library , just ... The god damn Gotham bat thing , I told you not to pursue . The police won 't help , the press has to do the right thing . You don 't get to decide what the right thing is . When the Planet was founded , it stood for something , Perry . So could you , if it was 1938 , but it 's not 1938 . WPA aren 't hiring no more . Apples don 't cost a nickel . Not in here . Not out there . You drop this thing . Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman . So apparently Superman . Doesn 't want us to think of him as American anymore . And really , why would we ? I mean aside from the red and blue costume and ... I don 't know . That fact that he has one third of the USA 's initials on his chest . I assume the only reason he 's not wearing the Declaration of Independence as a cape is ... He thinks it 's too on the nose What is going on back here ? Guys , come one . Let 's go . Put yourselves together and get out there . Put those glasses on those trays . We got thirsty people out there . Half full . Remember , half full . I wonder , would you excuse us , please ? - Something I like to show you . - Sorry . Now some scholars insist that it never happened . But I believe it 's the action perfectly in keeping with a king , who was also a psychopathic killer . For me , it 's the combination of 40 years curating . And I can 't believe it . But I 've finally got it here . It 's the sword of Alexander . It 's the blade that cut the Gordian Knot . - It 's a triumph . - Yes . - Enjoy . - Thank you . It 's a fake . The real was sold in ' 98 on the black market . - Now it hangs ... - Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar . Excuse me . Excuse me , Miss . The other night , you took something that doesn 't belong to you . Stealing 's not polite . Is it stealing if you steal from another thief ? Who are you ? Someone interested in the same man you are . Is that right ? I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph that belongs to me . Did you get it ? As it happens , no , I didn 't . The data you copied is military grade encryption . You know . I bet with that dress 9 out of 10 men would let you get away with anything . But , you 're the 10th . Mmm . I guess I am the first , to see through that babe in the woods act . You don 't know me , but , I 've known a few women like you . Oh , I don 't think you 've ever known a woman like me . You know , it 's true what they say about little boys : born with no natural inclination to share . I didn 't steal your drive . I borrowed it . You 'll find it in the glove compartment of your car .

Since the age of 7 , you have been to the art of deception as Mozart to the harpsichord . But you 've never been too hot of lying to me . The WHITE PORTUGUESE is not carrying a dirty bomb . What is it carrying ? It 's a weapon . It 's a rock . A minerals , capable of weakening Kryptonian cells . The first sample big enough to mean something turned up in the Indian Ocean 3 months ago . It is now aboard the White Portuguese being delivered to Lex Luthor . Who I am going to steal it from . To keep it out of Luthor 's hands . To destroy it . No . You 're going to go to war ? That son of a bitch brought the war to us , 2 years ago . Jesus , Alfred . Count the dead . Thousands of people . What 's next ? Millions ? He has the power to wipe out the entire human race and If we believe there even a 1 % chance that he is our enemy , we have to take it as an absolute certainty . And we have to destroy him . But , he is not our enemy . Not today . 20 years in Gotham , Alfred . We 've seen what promises are worth . How many good guys are left . How many stay that way . 14 hours . My name is Clark Kent , from the Daily Planet . I 'm trying to find out what happened to an inmate . - A Santos . - I can 't give out that information . Mrs. Santos . May I ask you a few questions ? He wasn 't my husband , and I know what he did . But he was a father . He was that too . They took him out of Gotham Central , they moved him to Metropolis . He 's inside there now . They know the mark all over . Guards don 't care . Bat 's the judge . One man decides who lives . - How is that justice ? - Talk to me . - Help me change it . - With what ? Your pen ?

SEARCHING FOR TRANSPONDER SIGNAL LEXCORP RESEARCH PARK I don 't have a halo over me , Mr. Secretary . I went into the desert , people died . It keeps me awake . It should . If you think that Superman is a murderer then throw it away . But , I don 't believe you think that . How do we determine what 's good ? In a democracy , good is a conversation not a unilateral decision . So , I urge Superman , to come to this hearth of the people tomorrow . To see those who have suffered . The world needs to know what happened in that desert . And to know what he stands for . How far will he take his power . Does he act by our will , or by his own . People hate what they don 't understand But they see what you do , and they know who you are . You 're not a killer . A threat ? I never wanted this world to have you . Be their hero , Clark . Be their monument . Be their angel . Be anything they need you to be . Or be none of it . You don 't owe this world a thing . You never did . - I have to speak to the Senator . - Not today . I said the Senator ... I need to speak to her before the hearing . Do you understand how important this is ? Please , I need to speak to her . - Please madam , I beg of you . - Let 's go . Please don 't do this . This is so important . - Let 's go . Don 't touch me ! - Please . - Sorry . She wouldn 't leave . I didn 't tell you the truth . CIA thinks the desert was a setup . Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty . The bullet ? The metal was developed by a private company . What company ? LEXCORP . Lex Luthor ? He also had private security contractors in the desert compound . Go on record . Not a chance . It 's classified . I happen to like my job . It doesn 't make sense . You said that the ambush was arranged to frame Superman , but how could they know that he 'll show up in the in the middle of the desert . Thank you . Alright , come on through . The Senate hearing is expected to get under way in any minute now . And of course the big unknown in all of this is : Will Superman show up ? That is what they 're really waiting to see . Mr. Keefe . Mr. Keefe . Soledad O 'Brien " In the Moment " Quick question for you . You 're heading in to meet with the senators . What would you tell them ? Um . I 've come here to tell them to wake up . This is flesh and blood . He 's delivered a war here . And this ... This is what war looks like . I have nothing . There are plenty of people , sir , who would say he 's their hero . He is not a hero ! Grace , can you get Greg up here please , right now . An anonymous source can verify everything I told you about what happen in Nairomi . - An anonymous source . - Run it . Luthor engineered the desert . It was an ambush for Superman . Trust your reporter . Think Watergate . Yeah , and you need to think litigate . If you are wrong , Luthor will sue the paper out of existence . You need prove . No . It needs to run now , before the hearing . If Superman knows , it might change what he says . I am not going to risk the paper , so that you can pass notes in class to the man that rescued you . He paid her ? Not , not only paid her . Threatened her . Gave her a script to learn . Prepare her to lie back home . But the girl 's got a conscious . He 's been using the committee as his puppet theater . Senator ! Hi , you . Don 't go anywhere . I want to talk to you . You know what , Mercy ? You go in and ... make sure no one takes my seat . So , what 'd you been up to ? I 'm just here to tell my story . That I was willing to finance a Kryptonian deterrent , but a certain junior Senator from Kentucky decided to block it . Yes , the Chair of the Committee on Superman is soft on security . Greg , why hasn 't he been getting our checks ? He is , Mr. Wayne . He gets a check from the victims fund every month . BRUCE WAYNE , OPEN YOUR EYES - He returns them . An employee of Wayne financial who lost both his legs in those horrific events in Metropolis that happened 2 years ago . Bruce , NO TRUCE - Jesus . - B WAYNE , I HAUNT YOU - BRUCE WAYNE = BLIND Why haven 't I seen this ? I 'm sorry . I 'll get to the bottom of it . And there he is . Superman is here . He 's actually at the United States capitol . This is really a historic moment . Now , we expect that Superman would give some kind of a statement to the Senate , to the American people , and of course to the world . He 's here . He came . - He 's above the Capitol . - Ow . You are going to be on the hot seat in there , June bun . I grew up on a farm . I know how to wrestle a pig . Do you know the oldest lie in America , Senator ? It 's that power can be innocent . Good luck . Freddy , let her go . - SUPERMAN = ILLEGAL ALIEN - THIS IS OUR WORLD , NOT YOURS ! - EARTH BELONGS TO HUMANS - GOD HATES ALIENS GET OUT ! GET OUT ! GET OUT ! Another one came this morning , Mr. Wayne . Let me say at the outset that I am grateful to our witness for coming before us today . This is how a democracy works . We talk to each other . We act by the consent of the govern , sir , I have sat here before to say that shadow interventions will not tolerate by this Committee . Neither will lies . Because today is a day for truth . Because only by speaking ... Only by working ... together , can we ... can we ... can we ... can we create a free and a ... GRANNY 'S PEACH TEA Mr. Lex Luthor CEO - Lexcorp Oh , my God ! WAYNE TOWER DEVASTATED YOU LET YOUR FAMILY DIE Excuse me . Excuse me , officer . Member of the press . Can you let me in , please . Breath slowly and deeply . You 're going to be fine . Thank you Uh ... I 'm going to need a little room to work . Ma 'am , you appear to suffer a head injury . Master Wayne ? Mr. Wayne ! This is a catastrophic situation at our nation 's capitol . We don 't have exactly the numbers yet , but I can tell you that more than a dozen people had died in this explosion . Crash responders are at the scene . They are still bringing victims out . Now initially , Superman was helping to bring the victims out after the blast . But he seems to have disappeared , raising questions . Carrie Birmingham , reporting live at the nation 's capitol . LEXCORP Capitol Police are confirming to CNN that the suspected bomber is Wallace Vernon Keefe Now these sources also say ... Clarke , it 's me again . Can you ... gotten explosive device into the hearing by concealing them inside his wheelchair . As for Superman , he was in the room , but obviously failed to stop him . I didn 't see it , Lo . Standing right there and I didn 't see it . Clark , there are people behind this . I 'm afraid I didn 't see it because I wasn 't looking . All this time . I 've been living my life the way my father saw it . Mending wrongs for a ghost . Thinking I 'm here to do good . Superman was never real . It 's just a dream of a farmer from Kansas . That farmer 's dream is all some people have . It 's all that gives them hope . This means something . It did on my world . My world doesn 't exist anymore . Wel .. Wel ... come ... Welcome . Analysis revealing ship operating at 37 % efficiency . Would you , like to assume command ? Yes , I would . Yes , I would . Very well . Let 's begin . The Kryptonian archives contains knowledge from 100,000 different worlds . Good . Teach me . Lex Luthor META _ HUMAN Subject : WW 2012 _ Central _ IMPORT SURVEILLANCE _ MBANK 22 JUNE 2015 , CAMERA 01 Paris , France VERIFYING FACIAL PROFILE RECORDED DATA CAM 01 PARIS , FRANCE RUE DES SAINTS BELGIUM , NOVEMBER 1918 BELGIUM , NOVEMBER 1918 Alexander Luthor , your security override has been accepted . Genesis Chamber ready to analyze genetic sample . Acknowledging presence of genetic material . Analyzing . I 've identified the host as General Zod of Kandor . Acknowledging presence of foreign genetic material . - Oh . - Analyzing . You flew too close to the sun . Now look at you . Advising . Action forbidden . It has been decreed by the Council of Krypton that none will ever again give life to a deformity so hateful to sighted memory . The desecration without name . And where is the Council of Krypton ? Destroyed , sir . Then proceed . Very well . Preparing chrysalis and commencing metamorphosis . " And so , we are left to wonder , " If Superman was aware of the threat and did nothing , " was he then complicit in the Capitol tragedy ? " Still no Kent ? " His disappearance raises questions . " No . " There 's still so many unanswered questions . Chief among them , whether Superman was involved in the planning of this attack ? " I mean , here 's an individual , who has unlimited power . Yet he did nothing to stop the bomber just a few feet away from him . This doesn 't add up for investigators . Burn him ! Burn him ! Burn him ! Burn him ! For 20 American $ , he didn 't see you . Same for me . He can see the mountain 's not passable . He 's come to die . Now , one FBI official familiar with this case told me they found , quote , " A jackpot of bomb making materials inside Keefe 's apartment . " What they need to determine now is whether he had any help in the planning and execution of the bombing and they haven 't ruled out the idea that Superman was a co-conspirator . Now my sources are telling me they 're getting a barrage of anonymous and incredible tips with all roads of this investigation leading to the Kryptonian visitor . Alright , Lois . You got to go . He didn 't know he was going to die . He just bought groceries . The wheelchair and the bullet from the desert were made from the same metal . The desert . The hearings . Everywhere Superman goes , Luthor wants death . But , Luthor goes through all that trouble , creates a bomb out of a wheelchair and alters it to reduce the blast ? What do you mean ? The inside of the chair was lined with lead . He couldn 't stop it . He couldn 't see it . Something , isn 't it ? We met in Kansas , live on a pancake so we come to the mountains . All downhill from here . Down to the flood plain . The farm at the bottom of the world . I remember one season the water came bad . I couldn 't have been 12 . Dad had out the shovels and we went at it all night . We worked until I think I fainted . But we managed to stop the water . We saved the farm . Your grandma baked me a cake . She said I was a hero . Later that day we found out . We blocked the water , alright , we sent it upstream . A whole Lange farm washed away . While I ate my hero cake , their horses were drowning . I used to hear them wailing in my sleep . Did the nightmares ever stop ? Yeah . When I met your mother . She gave me faith that there is good in this world . She was my world . I miss you , son . I miss you too , Dad . You know you can 't win this . It 's suicide . I 'm older now than my father ever was . This maybe the only thing I do that matters . 20 years of fighting criminals amounts to nothing ? Criminals are like weeds , Alfred . Pull one up , another grows in it 's place . This is about the future of the world . This is my legacy . You know , my father sat me down , right here . Told me what Wayne manor was built on . Railways , real estates and oil . The first generation made their fortune trading with the French . Pelts and skins . They were hunters . So falls the house of Wayne . We got to wait for more evidence , but the question still remains , where is he ? If Superman was not involved , if he 's got nothing to hide , then why hasn 't he been seen since the day of this tragedy ? - Look , you can 't point a finger and ... - I 'm not pointing anything , Warren . Look . - 10 fingers , see . - If there is going to be a criminal ... The night is here . Excuse me . Don 't I know you ... LEXCORP Plain Lo , in the morning Lola in slacks . Lois Lane . Mmm . Come see the view . Now , the secret is the height . It 's the building material . It 's light metals , which ... sway a bit in the wind . And you know something about LEXCORP metals , don 't you , Miss Lane ? I 've proven what you 've done . Wow , you 're feisty . Unfortunately , that will blow away . Like sand in the desert . You 're psychotic . That is a three syllable word for any thought too big for little minds . Next category : Circles . Round and round and round they go to find Superman . Wrong category , boy . No , not triangles . Yes , Euclidean triangle inequality The shortest distance between any 2 points is a straight path . And I believe the swiftest path to Superman ... .. Is a pretty little road . Mmm , called Lois Lane . Aahhhhhh ! You came back . You came back . Boy , do we have problems up here ! The problem of , of evil in the world . Uh . The problem of absolute virtue . I 'll take you in without breaking you . Which is more than you deserve . The problem of you on top of everything else . You above all . Ah . 'Cause that 's what God is . Horus . Apollo . Jehovah . Kal-El . Clark Joseph Kent . See . What we call God depends upon our tribe , Clark Jo . Because God is tribal . God takes sides . No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy 's fist and abominations . Mm mm . I 've figured it out way back , if God is all powerful , he cannot be all good . And if he 's all good then he cannot be all powerful . And neither can you be . They need to see the fraud you are , with their eyes . The blood on your hands . What have you done ? And tonight they will . Yes . Because you , my friend , have a date ! Across the bay . Ripe fruit , his hate . 2 years growing . But it did not take much to push him over actually . Little red notes , big bang . You let your family die ! And now , you will fly to him , and you will battle him , to the death . Black and Blue . Fight night ! The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world . God vs man . Day vs night . Son of Krypton vs Bat of Gotham . You think I 'll fight him for you ? Yes , I do . I think you 'll fight , fight , fight for that special lady in your life . She 's safe on the ground . How about you ? Close , but I 'm not talking about Lois . No . Every boy 's special lady is his mother . Huh ! WITCH WITCH Martha , Martha , Martha . The mother of a flying demon must be a witch . The punishment for witches , what is that ? That 's right . Death by fire . WITCH Where is she ? I don 't know ! I wouldn 't let them tell me ! If you kill me , Martha dies . And if you fly away , Martha also dies . But if you kill the Bat ... Martha lives . There we go . There we go . And now God , bends to my will . Now the cameras are waiting at your ship . For the world to see the holes in the holy . Yes , the all mighty comes clean about how dirty he is when it counts . To save Martha , bring me the head of the Bat . Mother of God , would you look at the time . When you came here , you had an hour . Now it 's less . CNN 's Brooke Baldwin is on the scene . Brooke , you 're live on the air . What do you see ? There 's something happening at the ship . It 's sending massive power surges . They 've created a barricade around this containment center . And we 're trying to get a little bit closer here to find out what 's going on . It is absolute chaos . You can see that lightning . Those surges of electricity and they seem to be getting stronger by the minute . Daily Planet . Lois . I have to go to Gotham to convince him to help me . Who ? Or he has to die . Clark . No one stays good in this world . But as of right now , much of the city remains in the dark to night . Much chaos , much confusing happening on the streets of Metropolis tonight . Those helicopters are still surrounding the area . I don 't know if you can still see those volts of lightning .

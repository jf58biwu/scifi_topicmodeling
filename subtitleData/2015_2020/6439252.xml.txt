 Our latest compound . It was hard to mass-produce on such short notice but I think we finally got it . Let me be the judge of that . It 's an organophosphate pesticide . Similar to VX gas . Kills everything it touches . And that should do it . Exactly how many barrels do you need ? All of them . You 're a natural with that baby . You 'll be the father he needs . I don 't know anything about being a parent . You don 't need to . You 're a born leader . You 'll help us to rebuild . To fill this room with the sounds of children once again . He needs a name . I hadn 't even thought of that . We can choose a name later . Right now , we have a job to do . Loose ends that need to be tied up . Loose ends ? The skeptics , of course . If we 're going to rebuild , there can be no interference . We can easily expel them from the Abbey . If you think that 's best . You don 't ? I 'm worried they might expose us . Can we afford to take that risk ? Sarah would leave . Probably Kyle too . But Alan ... . He 's like a dog with a bone . He 'd never leave us in peace . I will stand behind any decision you make . None of them can leave the island . Not even your brother ? Especially not my brother . Exactly how are you going to get a baby inside of me ? With this . What is it ? An artificial umbilical cord and placenta . It will allow us to implant Jordan 's baby into you . - And then I 'll be like my father ? - Not yet . Your body 's not ready to carry a baby . Well , get on with it . Sorry . We 'll need to raise your estrogen and progesterone levels so we can be sure the implant will take . Is this really necessary ? The sap is holding off the Mycosis , but you 're still plenty sick . How are you going to do that ? It 's not as though we have barrels of estrogen lying around . You do have livestock . A gradual course of bovine hormones should shock your body into creating the proper environment for the fetus . - When can I go see my mom ? - We 'll find her for you . But we need to do some tests . Figure out why you got better . - Think you can help us with that ? - Sure . When do I become immortal ? Once your system begins to react to the baby 's immortal blood you should absorb the genetic materials that kept it in stasis for 15 months . Now that you got that sap , we gotta leave . I need to distill it first into a concentrate for Kyle and anyone else who is sick . You can do that once we 're off the island . I 'm calling in an evac . Seal that perimeter . Dr. Farragut ? Take Soren to the Octagon . Alan . Jules . What are you doing here ? Looking for you . But you 've been busy with your new friends at Ilaria . The same friends you 've been stalking and killing ? I searched everywhere for you . I burned down every Ilaria stronghold I could find . - I never asked you to do that . - The last thing you said was , " Find me . " You 're right . Things are different now . Listen , Alan . Ilaria is planning to release a new version of Narvik worldwide . - When ? - Two days . Unless I can give them a viable alternative . To genocide ? The compound in Michael 's apple . - It 's the only option they 'll consider . - That 's the plan ? Slow death of the human race , as opposed to all at once . We 'd control the output . Limit the population without extermination . Spoken like Hatake 's daughter . I am Hatake 's daughter . It 's either this or Narvik . So help me or get out of my way , but don 't interfere . Or what , Jules ? What are you gonna do ? What happened to the woman I fell in love with ? She became immortal . What happened to these two ? I don 't ask questions . Amy said to take care of the bodies . Good riddance for this one . I never liked him much . They said you were dead . It 's too far to jump . And even if you didn 't break your legs in the fall , where would you go ? - As far away from here as I could . - There 's no running away from here . Could you give us a minute ? Amy told me to keep an eye on her . And I 'm telling you she 's not a prisoner . Now leave us . Sorry , Sarah . I didn 't mean for this to happen . Save your apology , Julia . I 'm not letting you give my child to Amy . If I don 't , she won 't give me Mother . Without the root , I can 't stop Ilaria . And the only option is using the child that I made with Alan ? You have to trust me . This is the only way we can save the world and your baby . By putting him inside that psychopath ? The fetus stopped growing inside you . Maybe gestating inside a mortal will allow it to grow again . If we try this , we give your baby a chance to live . Watch his legs . Make sure he can 't hurt himself . He 's still CDC . - Yes , ma 'am . - This isn 't necessary . I 'm fine . We have a new problem . Because we 're doing such a good job handling the old one ? There 's gonna be a new Narvik outbreak . - What ? - In two days ' time . You need to contact your superiors . I 've been trying . I 'm not getting any response . - Are their comm links down ? - That would never happen . Unless ... . What ? I need to make visual contact . Oh , my God . What ? - What am I looking at ? A rescue ? - Just the opposite . They 're gonna kill everything . What the hell is going on ? Why are those ships out there ? After the first attacks , the military enacted new protocols to deal with infectious disease . Anything with an R-naught over eight is met with a response . Plan A is containment . - Well , isn 't that what you came to do ? - And we thought we succeeded . But now that the pathogen has hit our ships they must have decided to implement Plan B. Which is what ? Eradication . Aerial spraying with an organophosphate pesticide . They 're gonna kill everything on the island . - You knew this was coming ? - We should have been gone by now . - What are you doing ? - Preparing for an evacuation . You don 't understand . Plan B involves killing all life on this island . There is no evac . You need to call on a different frequency , tell them there are people here . The protocol assumes everyone has been exposed and the pathogen is untreatable . Communications are jammed to avoid rescuing any infected who could spread the disease . Dr. Farragut , we 're dead . Not if I can synthesize a cure . We don 't have time . The planes will be coming in to spray at sunset . Then we have roughly six hours . You send your team out there , have them find us a secure place to hunker down when they start spraying . And if I can make this concentrated sap work we 'll hail the Navy somehow and negotiate our way out . Hello , doctor . I need to speak to Sommer . We 've been given orders to keep him isolated . He works for the CDC and is under my command so unless you want to take this up with the inspector general , step aside . You 've got two minutes . Thank you . Thank you , lieutenant . How you doing , Kyle ? Never felt better . That 's good . I wouldn 't want anything else to happen to you while you 're here on assignment . The attacks , the illness . You 've had some pretty bad luck since you got here . Guess so . But I guess we both know it 's not really bad luck , right ? We know who 's responsible . Responsible ? For all the bad things that have happened to you . To me . To Sarah . It 's Alan . He 's the one behind all our troubles . He is ? Someone needs to stop him before it 's too late . I could stop him . That 's why they sent me here . Of course you can . If you weren 't tied up in here . Why don 't we just keep this between us , yeah ? Thank you , Dr. Sommer . Have you heard ? You 're going to be a grandmother . Why are you doing this , Amy ? I 'm giving your life purpose . You should be thanking me . What 's that supposed to mean ? You always needed someone to worship . When Ilaria finishes making me immortal like Father you can bow before me . You think that 's what I want ? For you to be immortal ? Nothing could be farther from the truth . Oh , right . You 're still mad that I 'm in charge now ? I 'm not mad . Maybe that 's your problem . Don 't you ever wanna get really angry ? Scream at someone ? - Hit them in the face ? - I don 't have a problem . I 'm just giving you a chance to apologize . Apologize ? - For what ? - You 've hurt a great many people . I hope one day you 'll realize how your actions have ruined the lives of others . And I hope you 'll come off your high horse . If I wanted counseling , I 'd go to Michael . Too late for that now . Just remember I gave you a chance . Sergio . What happened ? One of the followers found him . - I thought you should know . - Balleseros was a trained mercenary . - Who here could have done this to him ? - I 'm sure Amy was behind this . You 're probably right . She still has what I need . What are you looking for ? This . Why don 't we take the root from Amy ? She has it hidden . We have to go through with the procedure . Fine . I 'm gonna help you . But this better save my child . Why do you need to take my blood ? Because blood is everything . It can tell us all about you . What makes you the same as others , what makes you different . Right now , I 'm trying to see why you got better when others didn 't . My theory is that your blood is unique . So now I 'm gonna analyze it to see if the data supports that . Does that mean that I can make Dr. Kyle better ? Maybe , in combination with the red sap from the Bleeding Tree . Just as I thought . Your blood is very special . - Really ? Can I see ? - Yeah , yeah . Come here . What does it mean ? It means we might just be able to manufacture a cure for the Mycosis . Move . Can you show me how ? Soren ! Mom . I thought I 'd lost you . Soren , what happened to your eye ? I 'm okay now . Dr. Kyle and Jerome- - I mean , Alan . - -they brought me home . They saved me . He was very brave . I owe you . And Michael always told us to pay our debts . Mom , he 's gonna show me how to make the cure . Dr. Sommer . Time to eat . Help me . Help me . I 'm sorry , Lieutenant Humphries but your path ends here . Peter ? What happened ? Is the baby hurt ? No . He 's fine . Not a scratch on him . And you ? I 'm good . Really good . Yeah . So it 's done ? Just like we talked about . Did anyone see you ? We have to be careful . I think he smiled at me . Did you see that ? He smiled . Now it 's your turn . Are you ready ? - More than ready . - Good . This should be over by nightfall . Hi . Remind you of anything ? - Where 's Dr. Sommer ? - No one knows . There were no witnesses . - This is wrong . - Tell me about it . No . I mean , Mycotics are brutal , they 're clumsy . They kill from a deep psychosis . This is surgical . It 's precise . An almost poetic reference to the tree . So who do you think did it , Robert Frost ? Has anyone been in here besides us today ? The other CDC doctor . He was here . Peter Farragut , my brother ? He wanted to talk to Dr. Sommer . Came in throwing his weight around . How long did they spend together ? What are you getting at , Alan ? I don 't think Kyle did this . I am not debating this . We 've got three hours before sunset . Continue with locking down the interior . If you come across Dr. Sommer , orders are shoot on sight . - Now wait a minute- - - I am not taking any more chances with the lives of my men . - Move out . - Yes , ma 'am . Come on . Thank you for your sacrifice . You died to ensure his glory . Don 't worry . I 'll be a good mother . Soon , the three of us will be sisters . Just rest now . It 'll be over soon . Interesting choice of words . Just remember , if anything happens to me you 'll never find Mother . I made sure of that . She 's out . - Don 't . - You don 't understand . It 's not your child . Sarah , I can 't let you kill her . I need you to trust me . Landry ? Landry ? Landry , my sweet boy . You can come out . No one is going to hurt you . Are you in pain ? Amy . Your sister is on a dangerous path , and I fear she has corrupted yours . Your feelings for her will be your undoing . You must break free from the hold she has over you . No ! Landry . Landry . No , please . Landry , please . Amy ? Amy , can you hear me ? How do you feel ? Fine . I ... . I don 't feel any pain . Nothing . You don 't feel anything because the procedure was successful . You really did it ? See for yourself . Finally . I 'm immortal . ... just like I was always meant to be . What do you want , Peter ? I want nothing from you , brother . Well , then maybe you have a confession to make ? You want a confession ? If the tables were turned I wouldn 't have helped you out of that pit either . Get out of my way . I spoke to Julia . She 'd like to see you . - Are you her errand boy ? - There 's been a new development . - Something about Narvik-C . - What about it ? She wouldn 't tell me . I guess it 's The Jules and Alan Show again ... - ... just like old times . - Spare me , Peter . You made your own bed . I said I 'd tell you . Go see her , don 't go see her . I don 't care . - Where is she ? - In the botany lab . - What 's she doing there ? - How should I know ? I 'm just the errand boy . Jules ? Jules ? Looks like I got me a big one . Well , well , well . - Kyle-- - Don 't " Kyle " me . I 'm on to you . Took me a while to figure it out , but I got your number now , doc . - You 're sick . - No , my friend , you 're sick . Back when I was sojourning at Casa del Cadmus I had some time to think . And the one thought that kept gnawing at my brain was : " What in the world was Dr. Alan Farragut doing on this island for all those months before the contagion hit the boat ? " I mean , if you were really here to stop the worldwide immortal conspiracy why didn 't you kill Michael ? You had plenty of opportunities . What now ? I can 't hear you . - Ilaria . - Ilaria , right . You 're in Paris picking off immortals one by one but you realize that could take forever . Then you get a piece of intel about a rogue immortal running experiments on this island . So you hop a boat and join the fellowship . Hallelujah ! Cut me down . You really wanted to stick it to Ilaria , didn 't you ? So you stay here . But not working against Michael , no . Working for him . Developing the perfect biological weapon . A fungus that would infect anybody who ingested it . You created this . You did this to me . No . Thought you were gonna watch me die , did you ? Now I 'm gonna return the favor . And then I think I 'm gonna eat your eyes . You know what I don 't understand ? Why we go to such inexhaustible lengths to hide these . Michael with his injections , you with your contact lenses . I will never hide my glorious silver eyes . It 's time for you to keep up your end of the deal . Where 's Mother ? Why you care about a dried-up , old root is beyond me . I couldn 't see before , but now ? Everything is so clear , so endless . - Well , that 's seven years ' bad luck . - I 'm not gonna ask you again . What do we care ? Seven years is a drop in the bucket . Just because you 're immortal doesn 't mean you can 't die . Fine . If you want it that badly you 'll find it in the hollowed-out belly of an old tree stump 150 yards north of the main gate . More duct tape here . - Tighter up here . - Coming right up . Yeah , disable the fan . Two more over there . What 's wrong , doc ? Can 't hold out any longer ? What 's this ? You wanna play too , huh ? Gear up , boys . This is going down . Get your MOPP suits and gas masks on . They should protect us . We have a mission to finish . You see , Father ? I 'm just like you , only better . You spent 500 years trying to make an immortal and I , I succeeded in a mere 19 . Your legacy is over ! And mine is just beginning . What 's happening to me ? You cheated me ! My God . You did it , Peter . You saved the Abbey . Now you just have to finish the job . You did this yourself ? Yeah . You showed me how . You said it would save Dr. Kyle . It did . And it saved me . I 'm on a good path ? You 're on a good path . You are on a good path . Julia . Are you okay ? You found Mother . So did the gas . It 's dead . Now the rest of the world 's gonna be dead too .

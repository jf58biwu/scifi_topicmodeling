 - Previously on killjoys ... - Whoa , whoa , i thought there were only five killjoy levels . - There are . Six is an urban legend . - I 'm telling you , It is a thing . - You . Broke . Your oath . - It 's okay to be angry , to hate me . It 's normal . - Normal won 't work here . That 's why i 'm angry . - You 're right , john . We 're broken . - You wanna fix this ? Then you figure it out . - Who 's khlyen ? - He was my tutor , At the harem i grew up in . Johnny , i need you To figure out a way to track him down with this . What the hell is that ! ? - A neuro-link . - And what do we do when we find him ? - I 'm gonna kill him . - You ever get the feeling ... It 's gonna be one of those days ? Buddy ! Smell that sweet , old town air ? It 's another beautiful day in westerley . Why don 't we just take it down a notch ? ( roaring ) okay , look . It 's a disorderly warrant . Ten joy fine , max . Hell , i 'll pay it for you . Just take a breath ... Good call , thank you . Ah , you 're going with the wrench ? Seriously ? - Dammit . - Lights out . Hiding weapons , monk ? Naughty , naughty . - They call it the ' little colonel ' . - Carbide casing . Undetectable to weapon scanners . - Peace is a dangerous business . You of all people should understand What it means to take up arms for something you believe in . - I believe in what pays . My years of fighting other people 's wars are over . Besides , i 'm not even from westerley . Your problems aren 't my problems . - Keep telling yourself that , Killjoy . - All you seventh gen 'ers Can kiss my- - - they can kiss it outside . - Wow , what 's with all the commotion ? - What isn 't ? Some fool spreading rumors . Says the nine are gonna renege on letting westerlyns immigrate to leith , Which is fine by me . Leith takes my drunks , they take my business . Drinks are half off for the next hour In honor of claimant day ! ( cheering and whooping ) - Sounds like business is good . - That 's the third time today I 've had to take out my own trash . Room and board ain 't free , you know . - I know , i know . I 'm trying . It 's just these low level warrants have me running all over old town . Without a ship , I 'm stuck chasing the dregs . Being a solo killjoy Sucks ponat . - Ah-ah-ah-ah . Careful , People will mistake you for a local . Oh , speaking of solo- - You got a visitor . - If you 're gonna take a nap , i suggest the side with actual springs . - Sorry . Rough night chasing down Some level fours on qresh . Speaking of rough- - pree charging extra For showers now ? - Ah ! I 'd laugh , But then i 'd have to inhale . - Why don 't we start With a peace offering ? Your stuff , from lucy . - Oh , thanks , really . Where are my manners ? Can i offer you something ? Some hokk ? - I just want to know you 're doing better than you smell . - Oh yeah . This lone wolf ? Absolutely . I 'm a free man running wild and free . - You said free twice . - Well , that 's how free i be . ( neighbours moaning loudly ) How 's john ? Say hi to him for me , i guess . - Sure . I will . I 'd better get going . - Yeah , i got to concentrate on putting up my ... Pillows and cushions , and such . - It 's underwear and some weights . But rain check on the hokk . For real . - Yeah . You know where to find me . I 'll be right here . Just right here . - Ho , ho , ho ! Easy , killer . - Don 't patronize . I 'm still dropping my shoulder . - Yeah , you 're stronger . That makes me happy . - Oh ! ( laughing ) That 's good . I know that fake warrant that i put you and d 'av through was- - - Inappropriate , juvenile , and almost melted our ship ? - Necessary . I needed to make sure that you 're ok . That you were 100 % back to you . - I 'm cool . Much cooler than you , but that 's nothing new . - Then i have something i 've been sitting on . - Your ass ? - A present . - Oh . You got us a pet ? - Funny . She 's funny . - Her name 's carlene . She helped me fix the neuro-link . - Sorry . - We can use it to track your friend . - Khlyen is not my friend . Are you sure this 'll work ? - If you 're ready , we can do this , dutch . We can find khlyen . Tonight . - I 'm ready . - ¶ ¶ come come come uninvited ¶ ¶ ¶ run run run ' til i find ya ¶ ¶ i don 't care which side that you 're fighting ¶ ¶ gonna get you gone ¶ ¶ - People have their own neuro-signatures . Brainwaves are like fingerprints . Everyone 's are different . Your friend- - Your target 's are very ... Unique . - Extra dickish , i bet . Electrodes . Now , last time , you both agreed to share one neuro-pathway . This time , your brainwaves will be chasing khlyen 's Without his permission . - We have to get your brain Into a fugue state . Cerebral projection requires a total immersion Of both the circulatory and nervous systems . - We 're gonna put you in this thing . - Will khlyen be able to see me , the way i saw him ? - This is an experimental hack . The truth is , it 's risky . - I 'll take that chance . - We 'll project you as close to khlyen 's signature As we can get . But we don 't think we 'll be able to buy you A ton of time either , so work fast . Alright . Now if things get too real , We sever the connection and pull you out , no questions asked . You all set ? - Fire it up . ¶ ¶ ¶ - You 're bribing me with a book ? Wow , you really do not know your audience ... - It 's for your brother . History of the faith . - And why would he be interested in that ? - We spent some time together in the black rain . He ... Seemed into sacrifice . - You 're a creepy little dude . - Thank you . Since we 're talking bribes ... What you saw on the street ? It 's in everyone 's best interest If the company doesn 't hear about the weapons . - Yeah , well , Lucky for you , unless there 's a warrant involved , i don 't give a shit about you , The company or your doomed - to-fail resistance . - So you 'll keep your mouth shut ? - If you put enough beer in it . - John , it feels ... Wet . - We 're flooding your hypothalamus with hydrogel ; It mimics cerebrospinal fluid almost flawlessly . - Just add it to my tab . - Ok , dutch , We 're go . Carlene , turn on the neuro-link . - This shit is freezing . - She 's connected . - Now she hunts . - Oh man , i feel dizzy . - [ just keep talking . ] [ describe your surroundings . Once we know where he is , ] [ we can come after him for real . ] - I 'm in a hallway ? A ... Nondescript hallway . No sign of- - Whoa , john- [ where are you now ? ] - There 's a podium . It 's ... Copper , or bronze ? Coated in plasma ? - Plasma ? Maybe some kind of computer ? Is there any security ? Is there any keypads ? - No , no , no . Nothing . Nothing . It 's glowing . No , not just glowing . It 's ... It 's moving . - What do you think ? - No keypad ? Bet it 's voice access only . - Plasma processors ? I thought they were years away . - Not wherever dutch is , apparently . - This feels familiar . This is his . Khlyen 's here . He 's close . - Just a few more details on the liquid computer . Just three minutes . - She doesn 't have three more minutes . I don 't like her vitals . - If we pull dutch out Before she finds khlyen , she 'll kill me . - We pull her out too late , You 'll feed her through a tube . - Can you get a fix on where she 's being projected ? - Deep space . Somewhere near the quad ... - There are number seventy-ones painted on the walls . - [ sector 71 , maybe ? ] - Khlyen . He 's here ! - That 's it , i 'm calling it- - - He ... He just walked past . - [ it 's time to disengage . ] - no . I can do this ! - [ dutch , where are you ? ] - neural shock . She 's seizing ! - [ you gotta get us something that we can use . ] - No ... - It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay . How many fingers am i holding up ? Are you okay ? - I know where khlyen is . He 's in the rack . Khlyen was in a part of the rack i 'd never even seen before . - Level 71 ? Is he their prisoner ? - He had an assistant ; an office . People practically bowed when he passed . Khlyen is part of the rack , john . What if he was part of it this whole time ? What if i never really escaped ? - Well , then let 's finally set you free . - No matter what it takes ? - I 'll clear my schedule . - The bad news is : The rack is in the most heavily fortified station in the quad . - Yeah , but the good news is : Our badges get us in the front door . So , covert op ? Levels 40 through 54 . We get positioned thereabouts , then ... - Then i could shimmy up through these ventilation ducts ? - Exposing you to enough radiation To melt your face off . - You 're right . You should do it . - Ahem ! Fresh soldiers ? Thought you could use them . You look intense . Those look intense . - It 's a level three leith job . We 've got this , d 'av . - Right . None of my business . Sorry , force of habit . - He could help , johnny . He 's great at tactical . - Yeah , sure , I 'm willing to give it a shot . - Bellus dug deep to get us blueprints of the rack . - The rack ? What 's the warrant ? - No warrant , but a long time coming . Khlyen . - You found him ? - Turns out , he never left . - We rerouted his neuro-link to track him . He 's stationed at the top of hq . - He 's in the rack ? Our rack ? - Floor 71 . Upper levels are officers only . Officers who work interstellar . Setting up satellite offices Around the j and introducing the rack to places that need order . - When you confront khlyen , how are you- - how are you gonna kill him ? - I 'm not sure i can . But now ? This is bigger than killing . I need answers . - If he doesn 't like your questions , How are you gonna force an answer ? Dutch , what 's your leverage ? - We hadn 't gotten to that part yet . - I 've had 20 years to get to that part . I 've got it . And a sudden craving for something stronger than beer . - Johnny , That is a lot of security doors on automatic lockdown . You sure this is gonna work ? - It has to . Dutch needs it . I need to orchestrate a reason for us to get higher point-of-entry privileges To the rack than usual . - Well , um , Good luck . - You too . - About your cause ... - Yes ? - I got one of my own . I figure we can help each other out . - Do not eat that , child ! That smell , like almonds ? It means the flesh has fermented into a deadly toxin . A single bite could make you sick for days . - The other girls Keep taking my food . - You are yalena , Of the family yardeen . - The others say it 's a shameful name . - Yes , they are cruel to you . Perhaps you can change that . Restore yardeeni honor . Your father is counting on it . He sent me to find you , little bird . To train you , And protect you . It won 't be easy . And you have to keep it A secret . No matter what hate They spew at you , No matter what punishment , The truth is , You 're special , yala . Now , Do you know the story of the wasp And the bear ? - You okay ? - Yeah . I think i 'm having aftershocks from that neuro-link . - Visions ? Nightmares ? - Just a memory about khlyen . Nice one , actually . - I didn 't think you had any of those . - Guess i 've only ever told you the bad stuff . - So , what 's the good stuff ? - He 's always protected me . There was a time when he gave me hope , When i needed it the most . Better or worse , He 's made me who i am . - Bullshit . Six years ago , i came in that door for the first time , To steal the prettiest ship that i 'd ever seen . And instead i found a half feral beauty in a wedding dress , Covered in blood , with a gun pointed at my crotch . - Umm , your head , if i recall . - You recall wrong . My crotch remembers . But after all this time , you 're still more your own person than anyone that i know . The only credit that khlyen gets Is for the bruises along the way . - Thanks . I don 't think this is side effects . I think it 's cold feet . I guess killing your surrogate father is no small thing . - If you wanna fight , i got your back . If you wanna run , i call shotgun . But you gotta decide , yalena . - Say it one more time . - What ? - What you told me The night we first met . - We don 't have to stay here . We can just fly away , and never Look back . - Not this time . I 'm gonna face him , johnny . - I know . Lucy ? - [ apologies . ] [ he still has authorization . ] - just me , johnny . I 'm glad you 're both up . - Couldn 't sleep . - Yeah , me neither . I know how to get you to the top of the rack . So that 's arkyn . Looks like a good place to hide out . I mean , if this goes to hell . - It won 't , and it 's not . That moon was the company 's first foray Into terraforming , before westerley . Didn 't do great . - Rack central , twelve o 'clock . - [ call signs , security clearance , reason for entry ? ] - Call sign u-gamma-4-4-7-1-b ; Level three , four and five reclamation agents John jaqobis , d 'avin jaqobis , and dutch . - [ reason for entry ? ] - Guys , it 's just a formality anyway . - Hey . - [ your reason for entry ? ] - We 've come to file for divorce . To dissolve our team . - [ you are clear for docking in bay 35 . ] [ welcome back , agents . ] - That 's not bad ! I thought we 'd be down in the teens . - Yeah , but khlyen 's on 71 . How you gonna clear forty levels ? - One floor at a time . ¶ ¶ ¶ - [ registered agent weapons . ] [ logged and approved . ] ( alert signal ) - that 's new . - [ warning : ] [ internal scan . Foreign object detected . ] - Oh , right , the surgery . Titanium stitches . And yeah , It really , really hurt . - [ rescan . ] [ titanium traces detected . Approved . ] - So we 're here to terminate our affiliation with d 'avin jaqobis . - We no longer intend to killjoy as a trio . - Fine . I will remove your sponsorship ; dissolve the team . So say you all ? - Aye . - Aye . - Aye . - I- - have some questions . Team awesome force , breaking up ? Must be one helluva story . - It drags a bit in the middle . - I 'll take it from here . Officer turin , call sign f-kilo - 9-4-6-r , now recording these proceedings . I have reason to suspect the recent actions of these agents . - I can think of a reason . You 're an ass- - - Let the record show , this is now an inquiry Into the possible suspension of your reclamation licenses . Well , this is a good day . - D 'avin back yet ? - Still gone . As should you be . Hills has his men combing the streets . They 're rounding up monks . - Over a few missing guns ? Hills and i have an agreement . - Had an agreement . Take the tunnels . - Have faith . The roots will carry us . - Why not file a split with your broker ? Why come all this way ? - Well , we heard there was a new chef in the caf , so ... - You think this is funny , Son ? - Actually , i do think it 's a joke . If you had anything incriminating on these agents , You would have arrested them the second they stepped onto the station , Sir . - He 's bossy . I like him . So why don 't you ? - It didn 't work out . - Did you sleep with him ? - Hey . - Yes . - And that made the jilted jaqobis mad ? You 're such a piece of work . - I 'm the one Who screwed up . I 'm the one they 're here to report on . - Do shut up , bossy- - - Because i beat her , then stabbed him . - You attacked your own team ? The rack takes assault on its own very seriously . - Then i wanna speak to a rep . But first , i wanna know That this breakup is official . I want nothing to do with these assholes . They ruined my goddamn life . - Like i said : I knew i liked him . There . You 're done as a team . And when i 'm done with you , probably as a killjoy . But i 'll fetch your rep , for appearances ' sake . Try not to shiv anyone while i 'm gone . - What the hell are you doing ? - C 'mon . We don 't have much time . - For what , d 'av ? - Getting you to floor 71 . Here ; earpieces that run on plathium . When this goes down- - - when what goes down ? - Your comlinks won 't work , Thanks to little colonel . ( beeping ) - Yo , what the hell ? - Anyone else think that would be cooler ? - Did you just power fry the entire rack ? - Little bit . Targeted pulse charge . Emergency lights and life support should be fine . - Do you know what you 've done ? - Bought you a few more floors And better luck with those now unlocked security doors . - D 'av ... - Look , i couldn 't tell you what i had planned . The charge is undetectable , But if they link it to me , i can say i acted alone , because i did . - You finally lost your damn mind . - Look , i get that you want to end khlyen more than anything . Take care of my little brother . - Nobody 's getting hurt but khlyen . - Go be a hero . - Sir . - Ah , najik . Some tea , please . I think we 're having company . - What are they saying upstairs ? Surge ? Meteor shower ? - Screw upstairs , i know exactly who caused this : A big dumb guy , a smaller dumb guy , and a bitch . We just gotta find them . - Contraband , please . Ta . - Okay , so what 's in the syringe ? - A gift . Got your lenses in ? - Uh-huh . - Remember what we 're here for . - And you remember that , other than khlyen , These are our people . They 're not our enemies . We can 't shoot our way out if things go wrong . If they bust us ? No more licence . No more killjoying . - You asking me not to do this ? - I 'm asking you to be awesome . - Always am . - [ attention : Technical issues being addressed . ] [ power will be restored by ascending levels . ] - Wilson said there was a fire on level 50 . That true ? - Dammit . No idea . - [ power restored to level one . ] - D 'av , are you there ? - [ yeah . What 's the word ? ] - After that baller move you made , i figure we at least owe you a ride home . So get your ass to lucy , we 'll be there as soon as we 're done with khlyen . - You got it , buddy . Halfway there . Talk soon . So , what 's with the mood lighting ? You guys forget to pay the bill ? Ah ! - Upside of no power ? No security recordings . ( panting ) - [ power restored to level 5 . ] - Just how big is this thing ? - You 'd think i 'd get sick of people asking me that . - Concentrate , captain comet . I 'm on level 52 . I need to get higher , faster . - How do you feel about catwalks ? - Meow . - [ power restored to level 8 . ] - starboard corridor , If i memorized the blueprints right . - [ you know you did . ] - Oh , good . Lucky the power 's out . - [ power restored to level 15 . ] [ power restored to level 25 . ] - What do you want , turin ? - What i 'm owed . Answers . - I had nothing to do with the power outage . - Sure you did , But i don 't give a shit about that . What 's your little girlfriend got planned ? Who is dutch really ? What makes her so special ? - Have you seen her eyes ? Ah ! - Do you know that she started at level five ? First time on record . All complaints against her get rerouted off-site And disappeared . I just want to know who 's protecting her . - Dutch doesn 't need protecting . - Then why is she marked for red 17 ? - What did you say ? - I 'm not the enemy here , son . Hell , i may be the only real friend dutch has in this place . So you got five seconds to tell me what i need to know . - John , i 'm here . On khlyen 's floor . Are you in range yet ? John ? - Terrible . Show me what you remember , yala . - I 'm not here to fight you . - Then you 're here to lose . - Dutch , if you can hear me , i 'm in . I 'm within communications range . I can hear you , and him . I 'm just calibrating now . So keep him talking . - [ i always hoped you 'd drop by . ] - ( khlyen 's voice ) : I 'm khlyen- - The evil assclown . Good to go . - Disappointing . So , so , disappointing . Better . But not good enough . Tea ? - What the hell is red 17 ? Why are you asking me ? You got nothing . - I got a stick that goes zap . - Yeah , and a fine set of hair . After that , you 've just got rumors and theories . Sad . - It was worth a shot . - [ power restored to level 35 . ] - there goes your window . Whatever the hell dutch is up to , She 's about to get caught . - Do you know what this is ? - Fermented calyptum . I can smell the almonds from here . I didn 't take you for nostalgic . - This is how you made me Kill second-matron . I was ten years old . I watched her die . - I remember . I was proud . - Torsin deck . He was always kind to me . He cried when i twisted the knife . Patela , the cleric 's girl ? I gave her the wrong poison . She screamed for six days . - Yes , well , Each death was a lesson . - The only lesson you ever taught me Was how to hate myself . - Do you really think you can make it to me with that needle ? - It 's not for you . - Yala ! - Back ! I have been racking my brain every day since i left you , Trying to figure out your weakness , Until i realized- - It 's me , isn 't it ? - Put down the needle . - Shut up . This is what it feels like . I want you to know What it feels like To not be in control . - Was it wrong of me to protect you all these years ? - You changed me . - Exactly . They were making you a victim , i made you a weapon . Now you tell me i was wrong , yala . - I 'm asking the questions . - Enough playing . I will not answer under false blackmail . - Then let 's make this real . - Dammit ! - Come to daddy . There 's no screen . Ferromagnetic maybe ? ( reverberating sound ) ( pulsating sound ) Imma gonna touch it . Carlene was right . It 's a computer . ( khlyen 's voice ) : Computer , search keyword khlyen . Don 't blink , jaqobis , don 't blink . ( khlyen 's voice ) : Computer , transfer files to pdd . A little for carlene , and a lot for me . ( alert signal ) Shit . Shitty shit stupid shit ! - Johnny , what did you do ? - [ i dunno , but i can 't undo it . ] Get to lucy asap . Our exit plan just got a lot more complicated . - [ breach detected . Lockdown protocol . ] [ all docking bays shut down until future approval . ] - What have you done ? - John has the antidote . If i don 't go to him soon , i 'll be past saving . And i 'm not leaving here until you tell me everything i want to know . Why are you here ? In the rack ? - You don 't even know what the rack really is , yala . You 're asking the wrong questions . - Were you always a part of it ? Even in my world ? - Yes . - Was that what you were training me for ? - Yes . - Why come back now ? Why ? Why now ? - You took a level five warrant . A kill job . That was the sign i 'd been waiting for . That you were finished running . That you were ready . Ask the real question , yala . - Why me ? - Ah . - Are you all right , sir ? - Officers only . - I- - - What was really in the needle ? - Millweed for the scent ; adrenaline for the heart rate . - Well done , little bird . Very convincing . It 'd be a shame to come all the way up here and not take the shot . - Answer the question . - Take the shot . - That 's not how i 'm gonna destroy you . - I 'm fine . It 's fine . - Was that her ? - Just clean it up . Clean it up ! - D 'avin . - John . - I think it 's time to leave . - I think you 're right , little brother . - [ breach detected . ] - how long before they know it was us ? - We get out of here before the security feeds come back online , they 'll never know . - Let 's hope dutch is already on board . - [ all docking bays shut down until future approval . ] - Lucy , instigate reboot protocol . Critical systems only . - [ john , i cannot disengage while the rack is in lockdown . ] - Balls . - I 'll do it . - [ no , jaqobis . ] I will . - Dutch ? Get back here , now . - I can 't . Someone needs to stay behind To free lucy . Just go . - What is she doing ? - You leave now , There 's no proof you were involved in any of this . You can still be a killjoy . - Hey , idiot . I only want to killjoy with you . - Get to the royale . I 'll make my own way home . - Lucy , throttle down . Now ! - [ i 'm sorry , john , ] [ dutch has instituted a master code . ] - I told you : Stop bossing my ship around . Initiate protocol : Freebird . - [ initiating freebird . ] - No ! - Be safe . - I think your free ride 's just about up . - Oh give it up , turin . We both know you 're not- - ah ! - Look at that . - What the hell are you doing ? Are you crazy ? - You ever go hunting for parson , Out in the badlands ? Sneaky little things . But if you manage to catch one , You break its wings , throw it out onto the sands , And watch all its little friends come runnin ' . - I 'm not bait , i 'm an agent . We 're on the same side . - See , that 's just the thing . I 'm not so sure we are . ( slashing sound ) - We 're not . - Where am i ? - Safe . Time to get you home , And for me to fix your mess . - John and d 'avin ? - Will suffer no repercussions For this foolish infiltration . You 'll need your full team with what 's coming . Keep that tourniquet tight . You 've lost a lot of blood . - Why do you keep protecting me ? - Do you remember the first time i tucked you in ? I told you a story . - The wasp and the bear . - And the moral Of that story ? - In the end , They save one another . - I need you to live . - Was any of it true ? Did my father really send you ? What are you ? - I 'm level six . - I 'm looking for alvis akari . Resistance And disobedience are punishable offenses Under the company directive , But you people don 't seem To be getting the message . - Maybe the problem isn 't the message . But the method in which it 's being delivered . - Alvis . I didn 't think you 'd make it this easy . - To talk ? We can always talk , hills . About sadness , Joy ... - No amount of joy is gonna get you out of this one . Alvis akari , you are under arrest- - - You really want to light this match now , boots ? - For orchestrating the leith bazaar massacre . - What massacre ? Hills , you know me- - - i don 't know anything anymore . - Hills , don 't be an idiot ! - Shut him up . Even if you have to remove his tongue to do it . ( screaming ) ( exclamations ) - What the hell 's going on out there ? Where is dutch ? It 's been four hours . - And i can 't decrypt Any of khlyen 's intel . I hope this was worth it . ( door opening ) Dutch ! Holy hell ! Pawter . We need pawter . - How much blood have you lost ? - Khlyen is level six . - What ? - He told me . - Dutch , he 's lying . Level six killjoys are a myth . - So why do i believe him ? - He 's still messing with your head . Look , dutch , I know a thing or two about bad dads , and if i ever get a chance , I will repay him For everything that he has done to you . - How many breakups do we need to go through Before you learn : I don 't need you to fight my battles ? - Doesn 't mean i don 't want to . - Then you better hurry . Whatever his plan is , I think he 's just getting started . - I know what you are . I know what you do up there . - Really ?

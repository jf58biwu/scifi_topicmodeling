[ door slams ] [ crow caws ] [ lock thuds lightly ] [ crow caws ] [ glass shatters ] [ flies buzzing ] [ gags ] [ buzzing continues ] [ floorboard creaks ] Breaking and entering is a major felony in the gem state . Now , what part of " stay in your hotel room " Did you not understand ? Didn 't realize i was under house arrest . Look , this is my colleague . I can 't just sit back and not do my job . Now , maybe you can 't understand that , Being a one-man operation and all . [ buzzing continues ] What were you just doing when i walked in here ? I saw some mud and some pines needles On the bottom of his boots . He might have been killed in the woods And brought here afterwards . Yeah , that was already in my report . What 's his body still doing here ? Where 's forensics ? Forensics is coming from boise , And it 's gonna take them a couple of hours . I hope you haven 't tainted my crime scene . No , the flies already took care of that . Mr. Burke , i want you to go back to the hotel room . We 'll let the professionals do their job . Fine . I 'm gonna go back to the hotel . ¶ time and time ¶ ¶ yeah , hey , hey ¶ Hey . Hey . Thanks for the clothes . No problem . They look cute . [ chuckles ] Thanks .

[ chuckles ] We have to talk really quiet . There 's mikes under the barstools . You said he tried to escape . I was supposed to escape with him . How were you gonna do that ? He had a plan .

Yeah , ethan burke for adam hassler . He 's not available at the moment . Is there something i can help you with ? Is this marcy ? Yes . Marcy , i left a message the other day for adam hassler , And i haven 't heard from him . If i said i would give him the message , Then i 'm sure i did . Okay . Are you sitting at the reception desk At the seattle office ? I have to go . It 's a simple question . Are you sitting at the seventh-floor Reception desk at the seattle office ? Yes . Now i really must go . There is no seventh-floor reception desk At the seattle office . Who are you ? [ click , dial tone ] All set , mr . Burke . You give that to me . Yeah . And i give this to you . Thanks . You must know just about everybody in this town . And almost everything about them . Do you know where i might find kate hewson ? Kate hewson - - i don 't know her . How can that be possible ? Ah . Ballinger . Oh . Yeah . She 's super nice . She 's been coming in here for years . She works at the toy store . Thanks . Mm-hmm . Hey . Hi .

Theresa , it 's over . Come here . I love you . Okay , get a room . Get a room ? Last time we got a room , we ended up with you . Man : Still no clues in the queen anne district assaults . Why isn 't it on the news ? [ radio shuts off ] Because it 's classified while - - While they investigate , sweetie . What isn 't classified when it comes to dad ? It 's his excuse for everything . What if he 's dead ? He 's not dead . How do you know that ? It 's been five days . Unless he 's with that woman again . Which would be worse ? [ indistinct conversations ] [ giggles ] [ indistinct whispering ] [ door bell jingles ] To what do i owe the pleasure ? I just thought i 'd stop by and say " hi . " That was so nice of you . How are you today ? I 'm great , i think . I haven 't been able to get ahold of anybody since i got here , And i can 't leave . And the only reason that i 'm here Is because i was sent here To find you and bill evans . And guess what ? I found both of you . Only you 're ... Working in a toy store And living in a house with a picket fence And a man named harold , And bill evans mutilated corpse Is rotting in an abandoned house on the outskirts of town , Which i found a little bit surprising . But other than that , i couldn 't be happier . What happened to him , kate ? And what happened to you ? Everything okay out here ? Oh , we 're fine , harold . Thank you . [ chuckles ] Ethan , i don 't think you 've formally met my husband . No , not formally . Nice to meet you formally . [ chuckles ] Well , i 'm a little under the gun . I 'm filling an order for the school , So i should get back to that , but ... Let 's get to know each other better real soon . I look forward to it . Great . Wow . I never got the wedding invitation . We kept it intimate . Yeah , so did we . Is there anything else i can help you with ? Yeah , here . Ring up this . Ethan . Ring up the ducks . [ clears throat ] What wrong with this money , kate ? The date on every bill is 1988 or earlier . The treasury seal , it 's counterfeit . Any trained agent could see that . This whole town is flooded with counterfeit money . It 's fake ! What are you hiding ? Would you like me to wrap this up ? No . I want you to answer me . What happened to evans ? It really is so sad about bill evans , Especially for his widow . He wasn 't married . You know that . Patricia . I don 't think she 's left the house since he died . I used to see her every morning , Watering her pink hydrangeas In front of their light brown house . [ chuckles ] Patricia has a real way with flowers . " do not try to leave . " do not discuss the past . " do not discuss your life before . Always answer the phone if it rings . " [ telephone rings ] Ballinger toys . [ door bell jingles ] Hi . Can i help you ? Are you mrs . William evans ? Yes , i am . You are ? My name is ethan burke . Bill and i were colleagues . We worked together at the secret service . I 'm very sorry for your loss . Oh , bill didn 't work for the secret service . He mowed lawns . Do you mind me asking how long You and bill were married ? Almost a year . [ baby crying ] well , i don 't mean to alarm you , mrs . Evans , But there 's no record of bill ever having been married . Look , i 'm alone with a newborn baby , So if you 'll excuse me . I was sent here to find this man . Now , i have reason to believe that he was murdered . My husband wasn 't murdered . He killed himself . Are you sure ? [ voice breaking ] am i sure ? I watched it . ¶ this town is getting old ¶ Is pope back there ? ¶ the whistle blows ... ¶ May i help you ? We 're not gonna do this again , are we ? Come on , you know who i am . Yes , we all know who you are , mr . Burke , And we 're all very impressed by your credentials . Well , where 's pope ? I don 't know . Let me look in my magic 8 ball and find out . Oh , wait a minute , i don 't have a magic 8 ball . Why don 't you have a seat ? Find any suspects , mr . Burke ? Because i found one . This ice cream cone here ? It 's been up to no good . Like somebody else in this room . You know , mr . Burke , I 'm starting to get the distinct impression That you 're not so happy with your accommodations . Perhaps i should upgrade you to a suite Or one of these cells . [ chuckling ] come on . You don 't expect me to stay In that hotel room all day , do you ? You haven 't spent any time in there at all . I hear you paid patricia evans a visit . Here the poor woman is grieving over her dead husband , And you go banging on her door like a drunken bible salesman . I didn 't know evans was married with a baby . You think the baby did it , huh ? Any word from forensics ? They picked up your friend 's body about an hour ago . They said they should have results back By tomorrow morning . His wife says he killed himself . Now , mr . Burke , i know that you think That nothing seems to make sense in this town , But one very important detail you haven 't mentioned Is that you were in a big-time accident with a very large semi , The doctors found bleeding on your brain , They wanted to drain the blood , but you fled the hospital . Am i right ? Is the body in the morgue yet ? Sure is . In the hospital . Good . Well , i-i 'd like to go over there now . Don 't . I want you to stay away from the body . Leave it to the professionals . Okay . Let me know what the coroner says . [ elevator bell dings ] [ paper rustles ] Mr. Burke . Can 't seem to stay away from this place , can you ? Is the coroner around ? No , he left . Maybe i can help you , hmm ? I thought you worked upstairs . I go where i 'm needed . Do you need me , mr . Burke ? No . Were you able to reach your wife ? I know you really wanted to talk to her . Bet when you two get back together , You 're gonna bang her brains out , huh ? Ben , theresa ! Dr. Jenkins : Mr. Burke . Thank heaven you 're back . Where are they ? Who ? My wife ! My - - my wife and my son . I just saw them ... Coming down this - - they were - - They were on , uh , stretchers coming down this hallway . Mr. Burke , no new patients have been admitted since you left . You should come and lie down . No , no , no . I 'm fine . We lost track of you the other night Before i had a chance to treat your brain hemorrhage . We 've been very concerned . I just saw them ! I 'm not saying you didn 't . You miss them a lot , don 't you ? I 'd like to see my ... My chart . By all means . I 'll find your chart . Please do that . But please , won 't you sit down just for a moment ? [ sighs ] Mr. Burke ... Every second , your condition is worsening . Unless i can get you into surgery , These hallucinations will - - will become more frequent And more intense . Have you noticed anything else go unexplained ? I want to help you , mr . Burke . But you have to give me your consent . Do i have your consent , Mr. Burke ? Nurse , would you get his charts , and then we can get started ? Nurse pam : Of course , doctor . Right away . Thank you , nurse . You know we can 't break protocol . If his face was on tv , We could get leads or tips or something . We are doing everything that we can . Except anything that could embarrass the agency , And in the meantime , He could die if he isn 't dead already . I am as frustrated as you are . Then act like it ! I 'm sorry , adam . How 's ben holding up ? He thinks his father ran off with kate hewson . No . He would not do that . Not after - - He transferred to boise , right ? Theresa , i can 't - - You can 't disclose any details . I know , i know . I heard it a million times from ethan To the point where we barely talked . Theresa . I need to know if ethan is in boise . [ sighs ] I can 't believe you went to the hospital . Maybe you do have brain damage . I thought i saw my wife and kid . Maybe you did . Get this . It 's some kind of ... Escape plan . Maybe we can use it . Well , before we do anything , We 're gonna have to take out your microchip . My what ? [ groans ] Aah ! Sorry . I don 't have any actual medical training . No kidding . Let me get it . [ groans ] Can 't they track us in here ? I 've hidden in here before with the chip . I think the thick stone walls disrupt the signal . [ winces ] Ow . I got it . I got it , i got it . Okay , now put it in your pocket So they don 't know you removed it . You 'll ditch it as soon as we run . This is the same technology they use to track animals . You got anything to close this wound ? Just duct tape . It 's better than nothing . Hmm . [ duct tape rips ] All right . [ sighs ] so , what 's our plan ? " our " plan ? You 're the secret service agent . You 're gonna come up with a plan . If i could come up with a plan , i would have left a year ago . Did you tell me that you came here in 1999 , Or am i hallucinating ? You weren 't hallucinating . And that was a year ago ? Mm-hmm . Well , i came here five days ago , and it was 2014 . Who was your president ? Bill clinton . You ever heard of obama ? 9 / 11 ? When 's your birthday ? November 1st . What year ? 1960 . Huh . You look pretty good for 54 . Well , i guess that 's a point in the " plus " column . Look at these tombstones . There 's no names , dates . The more you see , The less anything makes sense in this town . When i first woke up here , I was so disoriented that i believed them When they told me i lived here . I remember walking around in this fog With no competing memories . Eventually , they came back , And now i just keep my head down , I go to work , i go home . And i know this isn 't my life . Didn 't take me too long to realize That it was the fear that keeps everybody in line here . Fear of what ? What happened to bill evans . Who killed him ? Sheriff pope . He cut his throat while the whole town watched . Bill and i had a time and a place All figured out and everything , And then two days before ... [ door closes ] I think he just snapped . And he took off all by himself , and he gave me no warning . Well , you 're alive because of it . Yeah , i 'd rather die Than pretend this is normal for one more day . Hey . Hold this . What the hell are you doing ? The cameras ping off the movement of the chip . Oh . There 's hardly any cars around here . Yeah , cars . [ chuckles ] I haven 't seen a single airplane the whole time i 've been here . Now , look who it is . [ chuckles ] Kate ! Kate . Hi ... Harold . Um , ethan , this is kate and harold ballinger . We know each other . I 'm so glad you two are - - is this a date ? [ chuckles ] Well , i 'm - - no . I-i-i mean , well - - It 's not - - i have an idea . Why don 't the two of you come over for dinner tomorrow night ? We should get to know both of you better . That would be perfect . Oh , great . That - - that would be great . We 'd love that . Excellent . We look forward to it . Let 's say 7 : 30 ? 7 : 30 ? Okay . Yeah . See you then . Are we really going to dinner ? Yes , we are . Trust me . Man : Light rain for the next three days In much of the pacific northwest , But by thursday , We 're looking at a week-long streak of sunshine and - - Theresa : I 'm going to boise . What ? Yeah , i 'm gonna find him myself . Now ? No , in the morning . Either ethan is dead or he has abandoned his family , And i 'm gonna find out which one it is . And if it is the latter , Then i am going to kill him myself . Oh , can i help ? Yes , you can stay with ben . I 'm coming with you . No , sweetie , you have to stay with aunt darla . You have school . No , i 'm coming with you . [ chuckles lightly ] And very demanding . Mm-hmm . He 's barging in , saying " where 's sheriff pope ? I 'm a secret-service agent . I got a big emergency . " It 's driving arnie crazy . Well , he 's a wild one , that 's for sure . Thank you . Slammed me into a wall just a few days ago . You ever try and suture your own nose , arlene ? I heard he 's been here quite a bit . [ scoffs ] He 's probably got a little thing for you , beverly . Wouldn 't that be nice , beverly ? Finally settle down with someone , hmm ? I don 't think so , okay ? He has a wife , and he misses his wife a lot . Oh , so you talk to him . Well , it 's my job , If somebody 's gonna sit there , that i talk to them . But not about the past . Never . ¶ ... In the shadows by the street light ¶ ¶ on the sidewalk ... ¶ [ birds chirping ] [ gunshot ] [ wings flutter ] [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] Nice house you got here . I hope i never see this house again . Maybe we shouldn 't go to the dinner . We could just not go . I don 't trust kate . I don 't trust her . Hey , hey , hey . Evans didn 't trust her . You trust me , don 't you ? The last time i trusted one of you guys , I got ditched . All right , well , i 'm not gonna ditch you , okay ? Look , i 've known kate for a long time , And right now , i don 't trust her any more than you do . But if we skip out on this dinner , They 're gonna know something 's up . I worked it into the plan . I found a route that will conceal us Till we get to the outskirts of town . And tonight , at some point during the course of dinner , I 'm gonna excuse myself to the bathroom and check for mikes . When i come back , i want you to wait three minutes . I want you to get up , i want you to go to the same bathroom , I want you to take out your chip , And i want you to leave it there , Somewhere where they 're not gonna find it . Maybe behind the toilet . Okay . And then come back to the table . We finish dinner , and then we say goodnight . And we leave , and we go to the cemetery , Where i stashed evans ' bag behind the mausoleum . What if they catch on to us ? No . No , i mean it . You know - - hey , hey . They 're not gonna catch on to us ... As long as we stick to the plan . Okay . Just pretend . Woodworking was just always my thing . And , uh , when did you open the store ? Oh , um , when was it , harold ? Eight years ago . No . Mm-hmm . Has it been that long ? Yep . [ chuckles ] wow . Eight years ? That 's almost hard to believe . Time flies , doesn 't it ? Yeah , sure does . Can i use your bathroom ? Of course . It 's right by the front door . Ah , thank you . [ toilet flushes ] Harold 's specialty is rocking horses . Back in portland , my daughter has a rocking horse . Oh , i didn 't know you had a daughter . No , i mean ... W-w-what 's her name ? What ? Harold , how did you get into woodworking ? H-hold on , ethan . We were talking about beverly 's daughter . Will you excuse me ? [ chuckles lightly ] [ chuckles ] [ breathes deeply ] Kate : [ laughing ] no . Yes ! Harold : No , he does not want to hear it . He won 't let me say this . You 're embarrassing me . Harold won the horseshoe tournament For the second year in a row , And i happen to think that 's something to brag about . Uh , that certainly is . D-do you play horseshoes , ethan ? Huh ? You know , it 's funny . I-i never did play horseshoes . You know , beverly seemed a little uneasy . I 'm gonna go check on her . You know , she was complaining About an upset stomach earlier , But don 't let it interrupt your dinner . Well , i 'm already up . No , i 'm gonna go check on her . Yeah . If i don 't , i 'll never hear the end of it . You know what i mean , harold ? You know that , yeah . [ chuckles ] But i appreciate your concern . Sit down , sit down . [ sighs ] Ethan : I 'm sorry , look ... Beverly apologizes . It seems that stomach ailment Has really gotten the better of her . Oh , no . I hope it wasn 't my cooking . Oh , god , no . No , no , no , no . She 's outside . I 'm just gonna - - I 'm gonna walk her on home . Oh , of course , yeah . You should definitely - - Oh , uh , can i give you a piece of pie for the road ? Uh , oh , no , no , no , thanks . But let 's do this again real soon , okay ? Thanks . Sure . Definitely . [ door opens , closes ] [ sighs ] You think they 're gonna run ? Absolutely . Psst , hey . Listen to me . What the hell happened ? [ voice breaking ] i told them that i had a daughter . I slipped . I 'm not a good liar . They could see it in my face . Okay , it 's okay . I said - - Shh , it 's okay . All right . Let 's just walk calm . Okay . What did you do with the chip ? I left it in the bathroom like you said . Okay , okay , okay . I didn 't know you had a daughter . Yeah . She 's six years old . She lives in portland with my mom . Listen , promise me one thing . [ telephone rings ] If i don 't make it out of here , Just promise me you 'll - - Hey , hey , hey , none of that . Go to her . We 're gonna make it out of here . [ telephones ringing ] Oh , god . What is it ? That 's how it started when they killed bill . The telephones . All right . All the telephones ! [ indistinct shouting ] Woman : Come on ! Man : We 're looking out for them . Grab my hand . Don 't let go . [ ringing and shouting continue ] They 're gonna kill us ! Don 't let go of my hand . All right , shh . Okay . [ shouting continues ] Get to the cemetery . Get the map . I won 't leave without you . Go and get your daughter ! I 'll distract them . Man : They ran that way ! Man # 2 : That guy was last seen by the ballingers ! Man # 3 : They 've been spotted ! [ shouting continues ] [ ringing continues ] Right ? Yeah . Woman : A male and female . Hey . Hey ! Where is she ? [ shouting continues ] [ panting ] [ sobbing ] Right there , right there ! Man : Do you see him ? Yeah . [ breathing unevenly ] Man # 4 : We 'll meet them back at the rendezvous . [ indistinct talking ] [ gasps ] [ gasps ] [ doorknob rattles ] [ shouting ] [ panting ] Before we begin , I 'd like to thank everyone for being here . I 'd like everyone to take a moment To thank kate and harold ballinger For doing their civic duty And bringing this woman to justice ! [ indistinct shouting ] Beverly brown tried to leave . She discussed the past . Oh , no . As i 've said many times before ... [ grunts ] ... It is not just my job to keep this town safe . [ screams ] It 's everybody 's ! Man : Justice ! Woman : She deserved it ! [ cheers and applause ] Man : Way to go , sheriff ! Sheriff pope : We cannot tolerate people Who don 't play by the rules !

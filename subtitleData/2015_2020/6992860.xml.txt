 You are out Rodger ! You 're no good and you 're gone . I 've waited long enough for you to shape up and now you 're out for good . Aw ! Come on Cindy . Don 't be like that . By now Mister Rodger Dodger , you should have given up that crummy job at the glue factory and gotten something that pays a whole lot better . I deserve more than a title pawned car . No ! I 'm tired of staying in this week-to-week Motor Court . You need to get more money or you 're out . May I help you ? Our Space Buggy is about to crash . This is a really cool scene . Space Buggy ? What Space Buggy ? That is our Space Buggy . It looks like your Space Buggy just pancaked Cindy 's Super Bee . Yeah . Gnarly splashdown . Who was driving that thing ? Oh ! I was . Our Space buggy is equipped with a Time Advance Ejection System . In the event of imminent crash it transports passengers to an earlier time frame away from danger . I could have used something like that a few times myself . You totally wiped out my car . I hope you guys got some good insurance . We do not have insurance in space . You 're not in space anymore . Here on Earth you 've got to have insurance . You girls had better wait in my room while I call Al Sharko . Let me find that title pawn to my car . I know it 's here somewhere . What is your name you dreamy hunk ? I 'm Rodger ! Rodger Dodger . What a sexy name . My name is Aeliana . My friend 's name is Minoria . Some kind of groovy ! Rodger Dodger baby . Well ! It 's certainly a pleasure . Smooth vibes Daddy-O . So ! What are you girls doing crash landing your Space Buggy in this parking lot ? How come you didn 't land that thing over at the airport ? Moisture condensation caused our rear stabilizer to freeze as we entered your stratosphere . I totally lost control for a while . After the servos thawed from atmospheric heat I was able to get enough control to set it down on open pavement . Obviously not enough control to avoid wasting my car . That Super Bee was title pawned with Al Sharko . Take it easy Cindy . These nice ladies just escaped a fiery death . Way Cool beat ! Roger Dodger . Turn on ! Rodger Dodger ! What a gas ! I think I love you . Hmmm ! Dig the wig . Yummy ! Look ! I don 't know what planet you girls are from but around here , girls leave other girls boyfriends alone . Oh I 'm not really her boyfriend anymore . Cindy just threw me out . Oh ! No ! He 's not exactly a permanent throw out . I was just trying to motivate him . We have been cruising the galaxy looking for boyfriends . All the boys on our home planet were wiped out by testosterone fever . Yeah ! Our cool dudes be way gone . Rodger Dodger might help us out . Oh I 'd like to help you out . How 's the employment situation up there ? Well Rodger Dodger . Boys just need to stay busy being nice . Girls do all the hard work . Yeah ! Just shoot the tube . Don 't you get any ideas about going anywhere with my boyfriend . And you sure aren 't getting out of here until you clear up the mess you made of my car . I 'm calling ... Where 's the phone ? I 'm calling Al Sharko . Right now ! He 's got the title of the car you just wrecked . [ phone rings ] Yeah ! Hello Mister Sharko . It 's Cindy Wood . Cindy Wood ... Cindy Wood ! Yeah yeah yeah . The Super Bee . How 's it hanging Cindy ? Not good . There 's some flakey chicks over here who just crashed into my car and totally wasted it with their spaceship . Some Flakey chicks wasted your car with a spaceship ? Sure did ! They say they don 't have any insurance . You 'd better come over and talk to them about it . I 'll be right there . How would you girls like a Sonic Screwdriver ? It 's an Earth drink that everyone here loves . I just happen to have some Who Juice and plenty of Vodka . Yeah ! Lay it on me momma . You will just love our home planet , Moe . You can have your very own Castaway Island where we can live happily ever after . Purr my fur ! Oh Baby ! [ AM radio tunes up ] [ Surfer Band , Mystery Men pick out ' Order of the Black Sun ' ] So you learned all about Earth from television broadcasts from the sixties ? That was like , fifty years ago . Man ! Our home planet , Moe , is fifty light years from here . Television transmission signals travel slowly at the speed of light . We were only able to see a few of your broadcasts , like Dance Train and Castaway Island due to the solar skip . So ! How 'd you get here so fast ? We equipped our space buggy with Faster Than Light Drives that simply folds space so we don 't have to travel those huge distances . Those dresses are way too short . Do you like them ? We were watching American Dance Train . We wanted to dress like Earth girls so boys here would like us . Yo ! Me like ! You would ! Those girls aren 't wearing any underwear . We were supposed to wear underwear ? Totally groovy ! Sonic Screwdriver ! Oh my ! [ knock ] [ sinister organ ] Looked over the damage to the Super Bee out there . It 's a total loss . Ladies ! That 's no airplane out there . It is our Space Buggy . Yeah well , your spaceship out there is a total loss also . Cindy says you girls don 't have insurance for that thing ? Oh dear ! Are you going to arrest us now ? Naw . Do you have any cash ? Anything of value at all ? An Interstellar Navigation System . There 's no market for any of your advanced technology junk . I 'm just going to scrap it . What 's it made of ? It is made of cheap platinum . Platinum ! All of it ? Yes . I think we might be able to work something out . Of course you 'll have to sign it over to me . Sign right there . It is a real pleasure doing business with you . Looks like we won 't be going home for a while . Oh bad ! So bad ! [ Minoria moans in mortal pain ] Looks like you can 't hold your liquor , girly girl . That 's what you get for trying to steal my boyfriend . Oh dying ! So sad ! Oh baby ! Minoria is very ill . Can we do anything ? She needs medical help . Y-yeah ! We need to call the hospital . You can 't call the hospital . These girls are Illegal Aliens . If you call the hospital they 'll be arrested by the authorities . Rodger ! Can I speak with you in my office right now . We can 't call the hospital because I think I overdosed her . You think you overdosed Minoria ? What ? How ? I put some birth control pills in the Sonic Screwdriver . It was only supposed to make them a little sick . That girl in there is very sick . How many pills did you give them ? I only put my monthly pills in the blender . They 're just birth control pills for crying out loud . What if I would 've tried to drink it ? Of course I wouldn 't have let you drink it silly . They 're just birth control pills . They 're not poisonous ! Some ! Sometimes just one little pill can make you dead dog sick . A whole month 's supply ! Who knows what it might do to an alien . Don 't be such a horn dog Rodger . They 're the enemy ! They were going to abduct you ! Take you away . Use you for their own selfish pleasures . You didn 't want me anymore . What we need is that gun from your truck . That one Alien , Aeliana , She didn 't drink her Sonic Screwdriver . We need to do something about her before she radios the mother ship and gets reinforcements from outer space . Ok Cindy . I 'll get the gun . She is dead ! My poor friend Minoria is dead ! You 'd better watch your step Little Miss Space Girl or you 'll wind up dead too . Roger 's got a gun . It was that drink ! You poisoned the Sonic Screwdriver . It wasn 't really poison . It was just some birth control pills . They were supposed to make you a little sick . So that you 'd leave my boyfriend alone . I 'm not really your boyfriend anymore . You threw me out . Remember ! Well ! Now I 'm taking you back . No ! You 're not ! You just murdered this little space chick . It 's not murder . She 's not human so it 's not murder . It is murder . Looks like she was way more human than you . I 'm going to call the authorities . Rodger ! It 's not poison in the Sonic Screwdriver . It 's just some birth control pills . I 'll prove it . Stop ! That could kill you . [ Cindy gasps in mortal agony ] I 'm calling the hospital . Agh ! Do you really have to call the authorities Rodger ? I really am an Illegal Alien . I am afraid the authorities will arrest me . You won 't have to be here when the ambulance shows up . Where will I go ? What will I do ? I do not know anyone here but you . Right now you can just hide in my truck until the paramedics split . No-one will see you there . Oh Rodger ! You can be my steady boyfriend . You 're out Rodger ! Aw ! Come on Aeliana ! Don 't be like that . You had your chance Rodger . Now I 'm going to get mine . Please ! I can get better . You 're not getting any better . You didn 't get a better paying job . You never have enough money . Money isn 't everything . Oh yes it is . I 'm tired of living in this sleazy Motor Court . I want my own paid for car with a clean title . Bob Hey Bob ! What 's happening ? Bob . Wake up . You OK ? More ? That 's a fifty dollar bill . I know . Today it 's a hundred . A hundred ? Today is a hundred ? Take it or leave it . Marvin . All those are twenties . You owe me ten . I own you nothing . You 're getting what you want . For cheap . Next time it 'll be two hundred . Two hundred ! What gives ? Take it or leave it . What 's the big idea putting Connie under all * this trash ? You think she 's just some garbage ? Security 's tight around here ! So what ! She lives here . Next time , don 't be putting all this trash on Connie . She can wait out in the open like everybody else . Don 't worry Connie . Money 's really no problem . I can come up with four hundred next time . The important part is we 're together now . You and me . You know what day this is ? It 's our anniversary baby . I 'll be right back . I 've just got to get our party stuff out of the truck . Brought you some flowers . Our favorite wine too . Yep ! We were married seven years ago today . I 'll bet you even remember that funny little preacher that married us . He showed up with a shiny black eye . Said his mother hit him with a skillet . Your father did not want us getting married . You know later he told me that your brother wanted to show up with a shotgun and stop the whole thing . I think it 's because your family knows you 're smarter than me . But heck , aren 't most wives smarter than their husbands . They all thought I wasn 't good enough for you . We showed them . After seven years , we 're still together . We 'll get you all fixed up in your favorite nighty . You look stunning ! You know I had to stop by the store and get some ice . The ice machine in this motel never works . What do you think Connie ? These roses aren 't nearly as pretty as your wedding bouquet . Hmm ! That 's some good stuff ! That 's a really good vino ! [ knock ] What ? [ knock ] Excuse me ! This is some kind of mistake . Wrong room ! [ knock ] Bob ? Yep . It 's me . Let me in ! This is not a good time Bob . You need to go away . Ugh ! Are you here for more money ? No ! I 'm not here for more money . That 's it ! You 're leaving right now . You got that right . I am leaving right now and I 'm taking Connie with me . Huh ? Connie and I are in love . We 're in love and we 're getting married . Connie is not in love with you . Where 'd you get an idea like that ? You know , working nights there 's no one at that nursing home except Connie and me . Her and me got to know each other real good . Connie is in a coma . How was she supposed to be having these conversations with you ? Well ! We just did . I know what she 's thinking because , I 'm like , thinking the same thing . She speaks to my mind , man . You 've been working midnights way too long Bob . It 's done stuff to your mind . You need to take your little flowers and go back to the Convalescent Center . We have to get married . It 's only right . How 's that ? Connie 's having my baby ! Your baby ! How 'd that happen ? The usual way . We got to be good friends at first and then one thing led to another . Connie can 't be having your baby for crying out loud ! She 's in a coma ! She may be in a coma but she can still reproduce . Ugh ! Come on Connie , it 's time to go . Awk ! Yum ! Awk ! Awk ! You should have let her go easy Marvin . Why does everybody have to make everything so hard ? When a mans in love , he 's got to do what he 's got to do . Awk ! ( boink ! ) Connie ! You 're awake ! That 's right baby ! I 'm awake ! You 're not in a coma anymore ! I could hear you talking to me the whole time . I knew what was happening but couldn 't do anything about it . Do you know what day this is ? It 's our anniversary . Sometimes a comatose patient will regain consciousness for a short while only to relapse into a vegetative condition once again . However , this patient will never regain consciousness . You 're not a cop ! You 're nothing but a two bit bounty hunter . Buzz off bucko ! Not a bounty hunter , I 'm a skip tracer . Don 't guess I need to offer you a light . Not for this piece of junk . You got any real cigarettes ? Na ! I decided I 'd better give them up for good when they made possession a class D felony . Those dirty rotten politicians ! I bet those slime-balls get the real cigarettes straight from China anytime they want them . Just trying to protect people from themselves . Listen Georgia , I 've got to get you downtown before the judge closes his docket today . He issued a bench warrant when you didn 't show up for court this morning . I 'm not Georgia . I 'm her sister , Paris . Come-on Georgia . Don 't mess around . The judge is already unhappy with you . Really . We 're sisters . We 're like , identical . You 're twins ? Well , quintuplets really . There are five of us . All identical . Quintuplets ! Yeah ! We 're some sort of government experiment to make human clones . The project became totally unpopular so we got dumped out here . Identical clones ? All cloned from our mother . And the mighty USA is our daddy . Wait ! The office manager is your mother . Yep ! Our mother is our sister too , in a way . A creepy sort-of way . Really Paris , I 've got to find your sister right away . If the cops pick her up she 'll forfeit her bond . Did you check her room ? Which one 's her room ? She shares a room with Caroline . Room 119 . Rooof ! You all look alike ? So how can I tell who 's who ? Well , we can always tell . Even identical twins aren 't entirely identical . Georgia has three freckles by her left eye . And I have this nice mole right here . And an even nicer one right here . Room 119 . Right ? Yeah ! Caroline wears glasses . We all need them but she actually wears them . Do you want to see my glasses ? Maybe some other time . I need to speak with Georgia Almond , She 's not in here right now . I 've got to find Georgia before the judge gets really upset and revokes her bail . Georgia didn 't do it . Georgia was in here with me all night when Dakota died . We didn 't find out about Dakota getting hit by that trash truck until the next morning . The police think Dakota was also shot in the head . That 's why they think it was a murder . Yeah ! They say they found Georgia 's little gun under the corner of the dumpster . Like somebody wanted it to get found . Like why wouldn 't the killer just toss it in the dumpster with the garbage . You know Dakota was killed because she wasn 't going to share the jackpot . The lotto jackpot ? Dakota won the big one ? Yeah ! The whole family plays that silly game , except for me . If somebody wins a little something they split it up . The winner gets more of course . I 'll bet you were a little chafed about not getting your cut of the jackpot . I don 't get a cut . I don 't play that stupid game . Sure ! Dakota wins the big one and decides not to divide it up . Dakota and Georgia wanted to move to Oregon and buy a dairy farm . They said we could all move out there too and help with the cows . Dakota likes cows ? She likes the idea of cows . Dairy cows . She likes the idea of cows eating grass on sunny hills and making milk from it . I don 't think she 's ever milked a cow before . Georgia likes the idea of cows too ? Yeah ! But it was going to take everything , like the whole jackpot to buy the farm . So Dakota and Georgia decide to keep the whole jackpot ? Dairy farms in Oregon aren 't cheap . Mother says we 're staying right here . Mother wants to use the winnings to buy this Motor Court . I don 't ever play the lottery so I guess I 'd have to be a guest and pay rent . Were you going out to Oregon too ? Yeah ! I guess so . Dakota was my best friend , and I really love Georgia too . I figure they have books in Oregon but I sure don 't dream about messing around with cows . You know where Georgia is now ? Georgia said her stomach was upset . She wanted some ginger root tea . I figure she went over to Elizabeth 's room . What number is that ? It 's room 333 . But you 'll have to hold your nose . It 's my boyfriend , Cain . He 's not feeling too good . Tongue piercing went bad . He doesn 't look too sporty . His disability check comes in today . But after that , he 's out of here . OK ! Hey ! I 'm just a skip tracer lady . I 'm only looking for Georgia . She 's here man . She 's really here . We 're all here . This is it man . This is it ? The center of the universe . We 're all here ! Right now , man . Oh gee ! I 've got to find your sister so I can help her . A question . A cosmic inquiry . My sister ! My friend ! Bonds we keep ! Chances we take . Stars and celestial objects in the voids of the infinity . It 's a hairball ! Not just any hairball . It 's Peter 's hair ball . Peter ? Peter the cat died puking up this hairball . Peter can answer your questions . Yeah ! Where is Georgia right now ? Cat howling . Cat hiss ! Cat howling . Cat spits Georgia is with mother . She 's in there man ! She 's been there all along . Georgia sits in the bathroom . Georgia sits in the bathroom ? She sits in there man . She reads in there . Mother says she sits in there all night and sleeps in there . Georgia sleeps in the bathroom ? She 's been there all along . Jeepers creepers ! I should 've guessed ! Jumpers always run back to Momma . Mother 's got a gun ! You 're not going anywhere with that man . Georgia ? Mother ! What are you doing with that gun ? You 're not taking her anywhere Mister bounty hunter . Not a bounty hunter . I 'm a skip tracer . I have tried to raise these girls right . Like a rat eating an onion I 've tried . Momma ! You did the best you could . They didn 't have a daddy . I had to be their momma and their daddy . And teach them to share and share alike . This skip hunter isn 't taking my little girl down for something she didn 't do . I did it ! I shot Dakota that night out by the dumpster . Momma ! You shot Dakota . Why ? She wasn 't going to share . I had to teach you girls , you all need to learn to share . There 's nothing to share . This ticket 's no good . What ? Dakota didn 't read the numbers right . She confused a five with an eight . Needs glasses ! We all do . It doesn 't matter to me who shot Dakota . I just need to get Georgia in front of the judge today . I guess I should ride along and talk to that judge myself . You can if you like . He 'll make you get a lawyer . You must strap the patients down to keep them from hurting themselves . Exchanging brains can be somewhat violent . I never get violent . I can always control myself . I would be delighted to personally wire you up and strap you down . I 'm certain my personal assistant , Mr. Homm , can manage it . I can manage it . Ms. Bird this very instrument is the prototype for the next wave of identity theft . The British Navy 's Q Branch considers this Brain Interface Machine to be one of the most dangerous weapons it 's ever tested . They consider it to be the ultimate tool for identity theft . Are you planning to steal someone 's identity ? My company , Ostrich Publishing is very big . But it 's only the second biggest . Big Dipper Publishing is the biggest . I need to know about their next best seller before it hits the shelves . A young editor over at Big Dipper has agreed to work with us . So ! You 're going to implant your brain into a young woman 's body ! A double agent you can trust completely . I never trust anyone . That is why I am more successful than everyone . Oh ! By the way . Doctor Skipfly . Mr. Homm did ask about your special spray ? I do market this spray I formulated myself . It 's instantaneous and untraceable . It can kill a raging bear dead in its tracks . I can let you have this one because you 're already purchasing the Brain Machine . Mr. Homm . Test the sprayer on the Doctor . What ? [ TV screams ] Thank you for meeting us in this place . Miss Sylvia Bunch . Please call me Sylvia . Everyone always calls me Ms. Bird . You 've met Mr. Homm before . Only on the phone . Mr. Homm said that you want to borrow my identity so you can see some of Big Dipper 's current projects for yourself . When you spoke to Mr. Homm . You said something about your Mother being ill . That 's why you need the money . Yes , my Mother has cancer with just a few short weeks to live . Her only hope is a very expensive experimental treatment . You have to understand I really am desperate for the money or I would never do this awful thing to Big Dipper . I also have a mother . That is why I 'm so understanding . Did Mr. Homm tell you how I plan to use your identity to gain access to Big Dipper 's Boardroom ? No . He just said you have the latest technology for using my identity . Homm ! Show her the Brain Machine . Oh Wow ! Mr. Homm will connect us up to this little piece of technology and it will simply swap our brains . You will become me and I will become you . Do I need to sign some kind of contract or something ? On my ! No ! What we are doing here is entirely beyond the law . My cash is my contract . I 'm ready to get started . Now ! Miss Bunch . I 'm fine . Just a little nervous I guess . I never get nervous . If I do , I immediately remember that I am much too important to get nervous . Homm ! Hook us up now . Homm ! Her hair is going to interfere with the wires . You need to shave her . No ! Wait ! That is going to be my hair . The hair is fine Homm . Leave it alone . I wonder what kind of nasty little people have sat in this old thing ? Ok ! I 'm comfortable now . No ! Wait ! Let me just sit up a little bit more . Homm ! Can 't you loop these wires off my face . I can control myself without those . I am not at all nervous about this . I 'm much too important to get nervous . Screams [ electrical volts raging ] [ ding ] [ bass drop ] Saa-a-ay ? Homm ! Get me off this floor . These clothes are horrid ! Straight off the department store rack . I should 've made that girl change into something more suitable for me . Ugh ! My teeth need to be whitened . I 'm going to have to get them done right away . I just can 't be seen with these yellow teeth . Well Homm ! What do you think ? About what ? About me ! What do you think about the new me ? Depends on who you are . I 'm Phoebe ! Phoebe Bird ! Of course I 'm the new Phoebe Bird in a younger body . A body that 's more my age . Well ? You do look younger . Younger and more attractive don 't you think ? You look younger . Now ! You can tell me you love me . I know you 've always loved me . I have always liked you Ms. Bird . You love me Homm . Just say it ! I love you Ms. Bird . I could be in love with you too . You know , I 've always admired your young , strong body ! You know , I only surround myself with the best . Thank you Ms. Bird . Whoah ! Did it work ? It worked ! It worked perfectly . I see you made it . I made it great . I knew I would . I always come through everything great . It 's like I 'm talking to myself in some weird mirror . It looks like I 've gained a few years . It 's no problem . I 'll get used to it . You won 't have to get used to it . We might as well move on to the next phase of our plan . Mr. Homm ! Huh ? Homm ! What 's your problem now ? I don 't know . I think you need to turn that little green valve on the tip . I knew that ! These things aren 't rocket science . [ spray ] Ugh ! Well ! He shouldn 't have got his face in the spray . This was meant for me . Now that you 've stolen a younger body . My body ! You were just going to discard me . Weren 't you ? I 'm much too important to get old . Ms. Bird . You have indeed stolen my body . Unfortunately for you it isn 't the lease on life you were expecting . Everyone needs me . I can 't get old . My mother wasn 't dying of cancer . I was . It 's in that body you 've stolen from me . You have cancer . Cancer ? What cancer ? The doctors only gave me few weeks to live . You are going to need these . Probably all of them and more before the end . I can 't die . Not me ! I really was desperate for that money . My last ditch hope was that experimental treatment . But I really didn 't think it was going to work . I was going die of the cancer in a few weeks just like the doctors said . That machine ! I have to switch back . I must have my body back this instant . You can 't just let me die from your cancer . Oh ! I can . So , Sid . Why 'd you want Bettylou killed ? Child support , custody , alimony ? None of those . It 's the dog . She got the dog . I really loved the dog . The dog would do it . You 're going to kill her tonight ? Right ? How 're you going do it ? Don 't worry about it . Your Ex is supposed to pick me up in a couple hours to take me for my physical therapy . I heard you 've done this sort of thing before . You 're a pro . Right ? There won 't be any problem ? Listen Sid ! I 've got the best training available . I 'm very experienced . I used to work for the US army in Iraq . That 's where I got hurt . You got shot in Iraq ? Naw . Didn 't get shot . My buddy and I got drunk and were riding around in a truck looking for somebody to kill . He drove the truck into a big rock . But you been killing people since Iraq ? Not really . Mostly give guitar lessons and sell stuff I find . Oh ! Hmm ? Have you killed anybody since Iraq ? I been trying to work my way back into it . I don 't know Four-Eyes . If you haven 't killed anybody in that long you might 've lost your touch . Hey ! I still got the touch . OK ! Just last month I killed that old bag outside the title pawn shop . I heard about that . I heard it was an accident . It wasn 't an accident . I did it . I hated that mean old chicken headed lady . She 'd repo your car if you were two minutes late on your payment . Was she going to take yours ? No . My wheelchair . She had the title and I couldn 't make the payment . Like what was I supposed to do ? I 'm like , going through a dry spell in the music business . Kids just don 't want to play guitar anymore . How 'd you kill her ? I backed her into one of those big dryers in that laundry-mat she runs . Locked her in . Put in some dimes . Sizzzzzzz . Hee hee ! How many dimes ? Oh ... four or five I guess . Like I said , guitar lessons are running a little thin these days . Four or five dimes would do it . So ! You bring your gun today ? Had to hock my gun . But don 't worry ! I 'll think of something . Maybe ... Maybe , maybe I could choke the victim . You know ! Really ! Crush her windpipe if I can get her down on the floor . Argh ! That sounds like it might work . One thing ... You could suggest she tie you up . Bettylou loves to tie and be tied . I don 't know . How am I supposed to choke her if I 'm all tied up ? You 're not the one getting tied up . That 's just what you say . Bettylou will insist on being tied up first . Trust me , I 've been there . She 'll want to go first . I don 't know . I don 't have any ropes or that sort of thing . You don 't need rope . Use the pillow cases . You get burns from rope anyway . So , so let me get this straight . I need to tie her up with the pillow cases ? Like , while she 's on the bed ? No big deal . We 'll do a dry run and I 'll show you . Just twist it up a little . Like this . No you 're twisting it up too much . You don 't want it so tight . If it 's too tight you can 't make any good knots . That 's it . Now put a wrap around my wrist . Tie me to the bedpost . This beds awful shaky . It 's not gonna hold anybody . It only has to hold her long enough to choke her . Ok . Now do my other wrist the same way . I don 't know man . I 'm not feeling this . It 's going to work . Trust me . This old bed 's not designed for this . It 's made out of steel tubing . It 'll hold up fine . I need to take off your boots to tie your legs down . Not for this job you don 't . When her hands are tied like this , you got enough advantage to jump up on her and choke her . I don 't know . Now that I think about it , I don 't think I 've ever choked anyone before . You 'll be fine . You 've got strong hands from maneuvering that chair around . Just crush her windpipe like you said . How come you don 't just do this thing yourself . Like , you could save yourself a thousand bucks . And you 'd be the only one who knew about it . There 's always more problems when more people are involved in a crime . Like I said , I 've been there . Once I tie her up , I 'm in her power . Then I 'd let her tie me up . Then I 'm right back to giving her the dog . I 'd be better off smothering her . Like with the pillow . That way I wouldn 't have to see her face or anything . It 's not the same thing as shooting somebody . Man , you 've got to untie me . I 've got to split . Yep ! Argh ! I need to smother the victim . With the pillow . Whatever ! Untie me so I can pay you and be gone before Bettylou gets here . Oh , we 've got plenty of time . She couldn 't be on time to her own funeral . Let me go ! Argh ! Whuff ! You brought all the money with you ? You think I 'm an idiot . Don 't worry about paying me . I 'll grab the cash on my way out . Whuff ! I 'm limiting exposure to witnesses . Whiff ! Argh ! The hit man 's not like the yard man . He doesn 't just go away after the grass is mowed . Argh ! Argh ! I 'm ready to be tied up Bettylou . Oooo ! Ahh ! Four Eyes . You know you 're supposed to tie me up first . Eighteen a night . Extra towels are extra . Phone 's not working . Maybe the lightning zapped em . Happens all the time . Cell-phones around here quit when it 's raining . Say ! You young ladies look like you could do with a little something to take the edge off the storm . Moonshine ! Cool . Two dollars . Solid coin . Zoe ? Plus eighteen for the room . Solid coin . No Giga-Coin . Can 't register ya 'all till tomorrow . If I can remember . Don 't worry about it . Bad memory 's part of my charm . I love this little place . It 's like going back in time . Pre-Liberation at least . Like , in the old days when people brought their men in here . More of your deviant fantasies . So ! I 'm deviant ! You know , I 've always liked men . Zoe ! You don 't like men . You 've never even seen a man . Doesn 't keep me from liking them . There aren 't any men to like . Men are extinct . I like them anyway . Men are the reason for all for the bad things that have happened in the old world . Men are evil . We 'll explore the Pain Pleasure Paradox . Pain ... Precedes pleasure . Eighteen a night . Extra towels are extra . We 're Agents of the Server ! Oh , oh , yes sirs ! How may I help you ? We need a room . Well , I can give you a discount . A very good discount . I think you 'll do better that a discount Grandmother . Yes sir ! I can do better . Rooms for Agents of the Server are complementary . Grandmother ! You own this motel ? I 'm Gamma Class . I don 't own anything . Of course not . Your family might have owned it . Back before the liberation . It was in my family when I was little girl . That was a long time ago , grandmother . Back when there were ... men . You haven 't aged well grandmother . You were supposed to be repurposed at sixty . I 'm fifty-eight . It 's on the Server . Sure ! The Server 's down . We can 't review your file . Sixty 's the limit Grandma . Please ! I 'm not that old . Too bad grandma ! So sad ! Looks like you 've got some foil under your phone Grandma huh ? Oh , sorry sir ! The strap ! It , it was itching me . Yeah , right ! You were itching to run down your cell-phone battery ! There are more interesting things about grandmother . Much more interesting that the dead battery in her phone . No sir ! There 's nothing interesting about me . Nothing interesting at all ! Sometimes Gamma Class Non-Persons can be most interesting . Don 't you think Coppel ? Very interesting indeed . No sir ! There 's nothing about me . I 'm only a Gamma Class ! I 'm not even a citizen . I think we 're going to find out just how interesting Grandmother really is . Grandmother knows something interesting . She may even know about deviants staying here . I think we need to play a little game . Let 's take a walk ! Have a seat Grandma ! There 's nothing to be afraid of . The truth will set you free . Don 't you just love this Alice ! The Server doesn 't know where we are . Like , it can 't see us or anything . The Server protects us . If something bad were to happen to us the Server could send help . Something did happen . The Server went off-line . When the Server does come up it 'll see we 're not at the fertility clinic . I wish the Server would go off-line forever . Zoe ! That 's blasphemous ! Alice , I don 't want to get pregnant at the fertility clinic . Everybody wants to get pregnant at the fertility clinic . It 's a privilege . Getting impregnated with a turkey baster is no privilege . That 's how people get pregnant . Or ... a man could love me . That 's ridiculous . Men are obsolete , Still off-line . It 's a book ! Whoa ! It really is a book . It 's actually a book from the old days of paper . It 's a Bible ! Playing Gin Rummy by yourself Grandmother ? My little game , the truth game , is much more entertaining than cards . Much more entertaining . Please ! My file is on the Server ! We can 't access the Server . However , we can access the truth . Unbutton your shirt grandma ! No ! Please ! No ! Put the wires on me . Ms. Marx ? Please Penelope ! If you don 't mind . To do this property , you must know exactly how it feels . Hook me up ! Now , give it a crank . I don 't know Villa . Crank it ! What was that supposed to be ? I don 't want to hurt you . Crank that thing ! Villa ! Are you alright ? I 'm becoming impatient Lieutenant . Light me up ! Now ! I 'm afraid . My dear sweet Penelope . You really must get over that . No one does it like I do it . You need to get rid of that thing before the Server sees you reading it . Books are outlawed ! You need to turn that thing into the authorities . Maybe we can put it back in its little hidey-hole where you found it . Zoe ! I thought you got rid of that pencil . The Server could have you repurposed for playing around with that thing . Chill out ! The Server can 't see us . I drew a picture of a man . It looks like me ! Just in the face . You gave me parts ! You gave me a dongle . Well yeah ! I 've never seen a real man . It looks like ... A fish . It didn 't come out exactly how I wanted . When we left I time-lined all my friends that we were going to be in Atlanta . Everyone 's going to be worried about us . All those friends on your page . You know they don 't give a flying rat about you . They wouldn 't even notice if you never posted again . I 'm telling you the truth ! It 's all my fault grandmother . I just haven 't asked the right questions . I 'll tell you anything you want to know . I 'm sure you will . Do you have a man in here ? Like perhaps some old geezer who managed to slighter away from the purge ? There 's no extra doors in here grandmother ? No escape tunnels ? So ! The old man is still in here with us ! Right under our noses ! A man ? Lieutenant ! Your gun please . A true leader never asks her subordinate to do something she wouldn 't do herself . Please ! I 'll do anything ! Betray the man ! Villa ! Villa ! Villa ! What ! What 's your hurry putting that thing on ? The battery . It could use a charge . It 'll survive a little longer . You know the Server can have us repurposed for un-monitored intimacy . Don 't you just love how it feels when we 're totally alone ? Put your phone on . No . It drains my life force . Zoe ! I don 't want it on me . Stop . You 're going to break it . It 's the Whisky ! You don 't know what you 're doing . Maybe . Maybe I don 't know what I 'm doing ! Death by broken heart . How did you know about that man ? I can smell them . Makes the hair on my neck prick up . You can smell them ? They 're like rats . Rats ? When you see one , there 's ten more you don 't . We need to check the rest of the Motel rooms . Agents of the Server ! Allow entry . We 're investigating criminal activity in this district . I did it ! I broke the cell-phone . Destruction of Server property . Second-level felony . Move it lieutenant . We 're not here for this . Whuff ! What 's happening ? Alcohol ! A drunken Beta Class Citizen . What is it ? What are you people doing to Alice ? Ms. Marx ! I found this . What is this trash ? This Beta Class Citizen was concealing this contraband material , Sir . Looks like . A fish . There 's no men in here . This is a dry hole . Men ? In here ? The paper 's not yours , sister . Neither is the phone . It 's my phone . She was lying to protect you . They 're both guilty . Just shoot them Coppel . For only a second level felony sir ? Well then . Just shoot one of them . Pull the trigger Lieutenant . Now . Now !

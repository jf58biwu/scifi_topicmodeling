 Previously on " the 100 " ... Skaikru will not take the bunker alone . We will share it . Someone still needs to get raven . - I 'd like to volunteer . - And I 'll join you . - No . - Mom , raven needs our help . You have 23 hours until the death wave hits . That doesn 't leave you much room for error . What are you doing here ? There 's no time to get back . We 're not going back . We 're going up . We need you to get us off the ground before the death wave hits . What do you say ? I say that death wave can kiss my ass . Octavia , on radio : 5 years . Can you really survive up there ? Raven says we can . As soon as it 's safe , we 'll find a way back down . We will meet again . I 'll be waiting ... Under the floor . You 're not that little girl anymore . What is it , o . ? I 'm not sure I 'm up for this , bell . They look at me like I know what I 'm doing just because I won a fight . They look at you like that because you saved them . But it won 't last . - Now you have to lead . - How ? I 'm not a leader . It should be you or Clarke or ... O. , stop . Neither of us could 've done what you did , and it wasn 't just winning a fight . You gave people hope when there was none . You 're ... you 're prometheus , stealing fire from the gods and giving it back to the human race . Prometheus got chained to a rock so that eagles could eat his liver . Thanks for ruining my metaphor , o . I love you , big brother . Guess it takes the end of the world for me to say it . - Bell ? - I love you , too . Bellamy ? Bellamy , can you hear me ? O. ? Hey , o . , are you there ? - Bellamy , can you hear me ? - Are you there , o . ? - Bellamy ... - No , no , no . Come on . O. May we meet again . May we meet again . Hey ... Do they have her ? Bellamy ? The radio 's dead , won 't get to say goodbye to your mom . I 'm sorry . Hey ... Clarke , bellamy , get down here . It 's time . I know you 're tired , but we have to focus on the chosen now . 1,200 people are waiting your orders ... When to eat , where to sleep , how to live . The unrest will turn to violence . I 've seen it before . You need to lead them . That 's what my brother said . Indra , I 'm not a commander . The time of the commanders is past . The time of the flame is past . This is your time . Let me help you . This is it . We are all that remains of the human race . I won 't lie to you . The next 5 years won 't be easy . There will be days when we wish we were out there right now , but I promise you , if we stand together , if we are wonkru , then ... Do you hear that ? It 's 210 miles from polls to the island . According to what was our last drone , the wave is accelerating . If we 're not off the ground at least 20 minutes before it hits , the electromagnetic charge in the pyroclastic cloud will shut down the rocket 's avionics , meaning it won 't fly . That gives us 90 minutes to run a 6hour preflight check , retrieve the oxygen generator from the lighthouse , turn a cockpit designed for two into one that can carry 8 , and load the cargo hold with enough food to keep us from starving in space while we wait for the algae to bloom . I thought you said it was gonna be hard . That 's not the hard part . Becca designed her rocket to dock with polaris , not the ark . That means I have to pilot it into the hangar bay on the ring . What 's so hard about that ? That 's not the hard part , either . What is the hard part , raven ? Assuming we blast off in time , co2 scrubbers on a twoperson rocket won 't support 8 of us . So we use supplemental oxygen . Our tanks only hold an hour of air . Correct . We 'll have one hour to get into orbit , land in the hangar bay , and fire up the lifesupport system using an oxygen generator built to supply a lighthouse bachelor pad . You suck at talking people into things . You know that , right ? Anyone here still need to be talked into this ? Good . Now we know the many ways we might die today , why don 't you tell us what we have to do to live ? How much further to the lighthouse ? So you can talk . I wondered . It 's right through these trees , sunshine . What 's your problem with me , anyway ? What did I ever do to you ? You mean , besides trying to kill my best friend after he got hit with a spear because he was keeping you awake ? Well , he was making a lot of noise . You 're right . It was a dick move , ok ? Jasper 's a lot stronger than he looked . It was a shame he took the coward 's way out . - Hey , hey , hey ! - Hey ! You don 't get to say that ! Just take it easy , or you 're gonna tear my suit . Of course that 's all you care about . Look . I hate interrupting your little overreaction you 're having , but tick tock . 8 people alone in space for 5 years , and one of them 's John Murphy . I should have drank the tea . Tick tock , Murphy . It 's here . It 's here . Come on . Give me some light . Hey . Becca was brilliant . Her company designed most of the tech that went to the space stations that made up the ark . Compatibility won 't be an issue , then ? You 're smarter than you look . Come on . I need your help . The wiring 's behind it . You pull , I unhook , but not too far . We need all the wires to connect to the ark . Gotcha . This is as far as it 's gonna go , man . You got to reach in there . I can 't reach . My gloves are too big . I 'm gonna take off my gloves . - I 'm sorry . You 're gonna what ? - We 're running out of time . It 's your funeral . Pull it off now . Aagh ! Guys , need your help . Harper , let 's go . I 'm worried . I 'm worried , too , but we got to get this done . Come on . Give me a hand . So let 's go over this again . I figure two months until the algae farm produces enough to feed us . If we ration the mres , we should get there . Grounders in space , it 's an oxymoron . Survival 's a team sport , especially up there . It was the only choice . Only choice , also an oxymoron , by the way . So is cold sweat . Still holding out hope for that nightblood solution . There was never any solution . Alie was right about that . Our fight is not over . My mom had a vision of me dying , just like the one raven had that told her there was a rocket here . It is not the same thing . Yeah . They were both emp 'd . And Abby will be fine , too . Raven told her how to stop it . That 's not what I 'm talking about . If anything happens to me ... Nothing is happening to you . Come on . Let 's run these water numbers again . Please , bellamy , I need you to hear this . We 've been through a lot together , you and I. I didn 't like you at first ... That 's no secret ... But even then , every stupid thing you did , it was to protect your sister . She didn 't always see that , but I did . You 've got such a big heart , bellamy . Clarke ... People follow you . You inspire them because of this , but the only way to make sure we survive is if you use this , too . I got you for that . Raven 's premonition came true . Agh ! No ! Raven , what is it ? There isn 't enough time . We 're pushing too hard . What 's happening ? Computer , systems check . Launch system ... optimal . Navigation system ... optimal . Lifesupport system ... Assessing damage . It 's ok . We 're using supplemental , anyway . All lifesupport systems are offline . Just wait . Two more . Landing system ... optimal . Comms , talk to me . Communication system ... assessing damage . All communication systems are offline . Recommend repair options for communication system . Who cares ? There no one to talk to , anyway . Quiet . Damage is beyond repair . Total system replacement required . Talk to us , raven . We 're not going anywhere . Computer , terminate launch sequence . Launch sequence terminated . Raven , explain . It 's simple . There 's no power in the ring . Two minutes ago , I thought it wasn 't a problem because I could activate it remotely . Over the rocket 's comm system . So we turn the power on from the inside . We can 't get inside . That 's the point . Without power , we can 't even open the hangar door . Raven , think . You 've solved bigger problems than this before . Yeah , not in 53 minutes . - Raven ... - It 's over , Clarke . You know , maybe if I still had alle 's code eating away my brain , I could figure it out . I 'm not smart enough myself . Hey , raven ... You can do this . Yes , you can . How many times have you saved our asses before you ever even heard of alle ? Too many to count . You 're damn right . We don 't need alle on the ark . We need you . What ? Alie was on the ark . Alie was on the ark . I was right there , so close to the kill switch , but she got away by transmitting herself to the ring . Using the pod in the temple . Yes . If she can do it , so can we . Raven , we 'll never make it back to polls on time , and the radios are dead . We have something better than radios ... The satellite tower . You three , back in the cockpit . Finish those restraints . You two , helmets on . You 're with me ... Computer , resume launch sequence . Resuming launch sequence . Ok , everybody . Let 's go . Tminus 51 minutes and counting . Set it down . I got this . Go find your glove . Agh ! I can 't find my other glove . I can 't find it . Where 's the other one ? I got it , I got it , I got it . - Give me your hand . - Right . Here , here , here . Look . We 're gonna go on 3 , ok ? - 1 ... - Yah ! God ! Ok . 49 minutes . Hey , no , no , no , no , not with your hands , ok ? I 'll do it . It 's too heavy to carry all the way by yourself . On 3 . 1 , 2 , 3 . Who knew you were a secret badass ? Hey , hey , hey , watch your step . It 's probably a bad idea to drop the thing that 's gonna save our lives ? Ok , ok . Focus on me . Tell me about Harper . Hey , you guys seem pretty serious . You tell her you love her yet ? I mean , now , today might be the day . I told her . It 's crazy how it changes you , isn 't it ? Hey , monty ... Hey , hey , hey , monty , monty , monty , come on . Come on , man . Please don 't do this to me . Monty , come on . Come on . Wake up . I 'm sorry , monty . I really am . The tower 's less than a mile away . One more time , all we have to do is plug this into the junction box at the base of the tower . Satstarone is the name of the dish . - Satstarone . - Satstarone . Everything is set . Once the tablet is connected , the dish will align itself with the ark . The graphic will flash green , and that 's how you know it 's locked on . When it says , " send , " you hit send , and the powerup signal will turn on the lights , and that 's it . Are there any questions ? Yeah . Why are you smiling ? Because without comms , even with the power on , we still can 't open the hangar bay door from inside the rocket . Wait . How is that a good thing ? She gets to take her space walk . Murphy ? Hey , Murphy ! Hey , hey , come on . Murphy , where 's monty ? He 's in trouble . He had to expose his hands . He passed out . Look . If we go back now , we can get to him . You can be impressed with me later . We got to go . Aligning the dish is a oneperson job . Clarke can handle it . Harper will help me with the generator . Go . Bellamy ... Clarke , if this is one of those moments where you tell me to use my head ... No . I was just gonna say , hurry . You , too . Lead the way . Let 's go . Monty 's pack . Everything 's inside . It 's gonna take you a good 10 minutes to get back from the tower and down to the cockpit . You have to leave that tower with 10 minutes on the clock or you 'll be left behind . 10 minutes . I got this . Any last advice ? Yeah . Run fast . Emori ! Echo ! Little help here ? Don 't drop it . You and emori load the generator . Echo and I will take my suit . As soon as this is tied down , I 'm going after monty . Like hell you are . What 's wrong ? Where are they ? They 'll be fine . Everyone has a job to do . Echo , where the hell are you ? For crying out loud . Hurry . We don 't have a lot of time . Echo ! Aah ! There he is . Hey , hey , hey , hey , I got you . I got you . I got you . Of course he gets the hug . - You chose the machine ? - Yeah . I did . It 's back at the lab , which is where we need ... I may not hate you anymore . Give it time . Come on . Hurry up . Let 's go . . Satstarone . Ok . Satstarone . Good . Dish not aligned . Dish not aligned . No . Wha ... What did I do wrong ? Dish not aligned . No ... Raven , please say that you can hear me . Something went wrong . I did everything you said , but it wouldn 't ... Ok . " Manual operation " ? You 've got to be kidding me . Raven , bellamy ... If you can hear me , don 't wait . Let 's get him downstairs . Go . Go . Raven , a little help . Thank god . Monty ! How are your hands ? Let me see . No . Leave them on . There 's no time . We 'll deal with it on the ark . It 's tminus 5 minutes and counting . Clarke 's not back yet ? By now she should be on her way . Everybody , refill your O2 tanks and load up . Remember , we 'll have an hour each . Don 't turn them on till I tell you , and after that , breathe easy . Where the hell 's echo ? Great . I 'll find her . You get everybody strapped in . Echo ? Wouldn 't it be easier just to walk outside ? Get out , bellamy . Go back to the sky where you belong . I belong nowhere . You do that , you die a coward . I betrayed you . Why are you trying to save me ? Because , echo , I 'm afraid , too . We are about to head to space , where we will be tested every minute of every day for the next 5 years . I 'm not gonna lie to you . I still don 't trust you ... Maybe I never will ... But you are strong . We have a better chance of surviving if you 're up there with us . Plus , we may need to throw someone overboard to lighten the load . Whatever this is , finish it . Two minutes to launch . Let 's go . Put this back on now . Clarke ? We 'll wait as long as we can . Argh ! Come on , Clarke . Bellamy . I know , raven . The radiation 's already affecting the avionics . It 's now or never . She isn 't coming ? Can we give her another minute ? We 're out of time . This is what Clarke would want us to do . If we wait , then we die . Wait . How are we gonna know she got the power on , then ? We 'll know when we get there . Opening launch door . You sure about this ? It 's the only choice . Initiating countdown . Go for launch in tminus 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . May we meet again . Almost there . Booster separation in 3 , 2 , 1 . Separation complete . Ha ha ha ! Welcome to zero g , boys and girls . No . Remember , oxygen is limited . No floating . Your heart rate will rise , and you 'll use too much air . Doesn 't matter if the lights aren 't on . Computer , engage navigation system , preset coordinates . Get me to the damn door , and I 'll do the rest . Preset coordinates engaged . We should be getting our first look at the ring right about ... Now . The ring is dark . She didn 't get it done . She will . Ready for a space walk , raven ? You know I am , but if Clarke doesn 't get the power on ... Suiting up . Satstarone . Satstarone . Dish not aligned . Dish not aligned . Come on . Turn ! Manual override recommended . Here goes nothing . ! Damn it . Warning ... oxygen at 18 % . Come on , Clarke . You can do this . - Dish aligned . - Yes ! Dish aligned . Dish aligned . Heh . No . No . No ! 15 % . There 's 10 minutes of air left . 17 % . Well , that 's good . At least I don 't have to watch you die . I left her behind . I left her behind , and we all die , anyway . Bellamy , look . She did it . Oxygen level ... critical . God . Home , sweet home ? There 's an access panel down at the end of the hallway . Oxygen level ... critical . She 's out of oxygen . What do we do ? We share . Put her down near the vents . It 's where the air will arrive first . Monty , know where this goes ? I 'll have to talk you through it . No , no , no , no . We 'll use mine . I 've got more . Get her helmet . Raven , raven , raven . Harper . Oxygen level ... critical . Bellamy , hurry up . Harper 's running out of air . Move ! Ok . Get the tubes . - Harper ... - I got her . I got her . That 's it . Harper ... My hands . Here . Share , share . Monty , what next ? Ok . We need to connect the ark power to the generator conduits . Look for a redandblack wire . All right . Got it . Come on . Hey , monty , monty , monty , no . Hey , hey , it 's connected . What do I do ? The breaker , flip it . All right . Ok . Hang on . It 's all right . Hey . Yeah . Ha ha ha ! She saved us again . Think we can do this without her ? If we don 't , she died in vain , and I 'm not gonna let that happen . You with me ? Always . Here we go again . Bellamy , if you can hear me , you 're alive . It 's been 2,199 days since praimfaya . I don 't know why I still do this every day . Maybe it 's my way of staying sane , not forgetting who I am ... Who I was . It 's been safe for you to come down for over a year now . Why haven 't you ? The bunker 's gone silent , too . We tried digging them out for a while , but there was too much rubble . I haven 't made contact with them , either . Anyway , I still have hope . Tell raven to aim for the one spot of green , and you 'll find me . The rest of the planet , from what I 've seen , basically sucks , so ... Never mind . I see you . It 's time to wake up . Maddie , go get my rifle now . Here . We 're here ! We 're here ! Stop . Get down . I want you to back up the rover . Get it out of sight and load the guns . All of them ? All of them .

 Previously , on Continuum . We need to work together because I 'm the guy holding your golden ticket . What happens with you ? You made your choice . You chose you . I 'm reprogramming it . Will it work ? That 's the question I 'm afraid to ask myself . Somewhere in time the traveller changed something . His future ceased to exist . A moment is coming . A chance to repair everything . Brad 's here , I think he 's here for the key . Nothing personal , but I 've got a deadline . Give me Kellogg ! I 'll come for you . The plan moves ahead . I promise . Time 's up . Nora gave us approval to hit them hard . We 've got eyes on the building but they haven 't made a move . They won 't . They can 't . When 's your team going in ? Well , we 're gearing up now . I know I can 't stop you . I don 't want to . But I need to ask one last favour . Please , give me a head-start before you launch your assault . What are you doing ? Making a tsunami . Don 't worry about it . Ok . I won 't . Time to go . That has multiple meanings at this point . Those officers , Travis , they died trying to prevent what Kellogg 's army is about to do . The least we can do is finish the job . You know , even if I figured out a way to send you forward in time , I 'm still not entirely sure which future I 'll be sending you to . Odds are it 'll be linked to Kellogg 's dark future which , if we don 't stop him now , it 'll be a very nasty place in 60 years . But if there 's even the slightest chance that I can be with Sam again , I 'm willing to risk everything . Ok . Let 's go risk everything . I just hope it 's not too late . This cost us two good marines . It cost a lot more than that . Once we send the pulse signal to our future and tether , we will be locked . When that happens you only have 90 minutes to get everyone through before the tether degrades completely . Is that gonna be enough ? There 's only one way to find out . Do it . Tether is locked , the clock 's running . Open the portal . Turn it off ! What the hell happened , Zorin ? I don 't know , I ... what happened ? The key 's been shorted . Fix it , now . The tether is holding , the clock is still running . Grimes , I 'm sorry . Sorry ? I just lost good men . Men you 'll miss unless we get this portal back online . Where 's Marcellus ? He didn 't make it . Are you kidding me ? We need to get this portal open again quickly or the only thing coming through will be the enemy . It 's for the best . I guess we 're eating in tonight . You know , when I first came to this timeline , I thought that having it all was within my grasp . But when I really thought about it , not having something to fight for ... someone to fight for ... well , it all seems just a little ... unsatisfying . I 'm guessing the other me , the future me , he found something or someone worth fighting for . Well , based on the shaking floors and walls , I 'm guessing you fired up your machine . Yes , we did . So uh ... that 's it , I guess we 're all done here . Not yet . We 're having a small problem with one of our key components . You wouldn 't happen to know if uh ... Cameron or Sadler sabotaged it ? I wouldn 't put it past them . Hmm . Are you doing alright , sir ? Well , you know , while I certainly appreciate the degree to which you made efforts to get me out of the police station , I just can 't help but feel I moved from one cell to another . This is for your safety . You mean me , or other me ? At this point , what happens to you happens to him . Our times are tethered now , which means any changes in this moment would ripple into our future . Your safety is paramount . Hey , well I feel better already . So when geriatric me arrives , what happens to me , me ? What with the whole kidney failure situation and everything . You were very specific . Before we left you issued strict protocols regarding how to deal with you . You were to be treated in a manner befitting your importance . But that 's a sliding scale , isn 't it ? Important now , liability later . It 's not like that . Let 's say he decides to come here . Our times are linked by that machine out there . That means no new timeline . That means a paradox . I have a little experience with paradoxes , I lost my grandmother to one in 2012 . I have no idea what you 're talking about . Has anyone ever told you that you 're a terrible liar ? You got your head start . I 'll be 30 minutes behind you . Thank you . You know , as much as you 've screwed up my life and my job and , well , my understanding of everything , I hate to admit it but I wouldn 't change a damn thing . You reminded me of what 's important . What being a protector really means . There 's a lot to fix in this time , you know . You could stay and we could work together . Guarantee your future never happened . That 's what I 'm counting on . With or without me , that 's exactly what you and Alec are going to do . I want to help you , but I also don 't want to lose you . You 've always been there for me . I always will . I know . Ok . Don 't make me regret getting all emotional . Get out of here . You 're a good man . You ready ? Yeah . What the hell happened in there ? I know you and Carlos are covering for Travis . I need to know why . I 've wanted to tell you . Before now . But I think it 's better if I show you . I don 't understand . Me , Travis , Liber8 , Kellogg and his army ... we 're from the future . I 'm trying to get back to the year 2077 . We came here to change history . To make a better world , and today it 's all on the line . You 're not kidding ? We could use a good man like you . Can I get you a glass ? No , thank you . Save it . Sounds ominous . I know what you 're trying to do . What am I trying to do ? You 're trying to talk me into letting you out of here or giving you information you want . No . Yeah . Whatever . But it 's bigger than that . And it involves a certain you . You 're wasting your time . In this case , I think I 'm using what 's left of it wisely . Consider this : why have an old , sick Kellogg leading you when you can have a young and vital Kellogg ? Sure , he needs to get up to speed , but together they can accomplish this . She will always be by his side as his queen and rule their new empire together . I see love in there . You have feelings for me . But we can never be together . Never . If you had just listened to me , believed in me , we could have had something . I could ... I could never ... Why ? Am I that repulsive ? You 're ... my ... my father ... Of course I am . Thank you , Jason . So this is it . This is really it ? No second thoughts , no turning back ? Jason , you can come with me . You can go home , too . No , it 's too much . It 's too late . I 've been here too long . No , this is my home now . I still have some work to do . Ok . If you manage to make it back to 2077 , give this to my father . There are some things I needed to say to him , to you , that I never had the chance to before I left . I will . Alright , it 's time . Let 's hope Kellogg holds up his end of the bargain . Goodbye , Jason . Bye . You alright ? Where is he ? He 's close . How 's our arrangement looking ? She 'll show , I know it . My demands . Let 's go . This better be you , Kellogg . Game on , protector . Head for the north-east door . You need to move quickly . How are we doing on that key ? Getting there . Every minute costs us lives . Did Marcellus know ? Did Marcellus know what ? That this was an invasion ? What are you talking about ? Oh , come on . Just tell me . I want to know if he lied to me or if you kept him in the dark , too . Alright . I suppose it doesn 't make a difference now . Yeah , Marcellus knew . It was his idea to convince you otherwise . He knew the first minute we arrived you went soft . I betrayed people thinking this was the only way to save families ! Nothing 's changed , Tonkin . We 're still saving families . Ours . Kiera ? Yeah ? You saved me . What are you talking about ? We all go through life thinking we know how it 's gonna turn out . We imagine our future , we make moves and decisions that lead us in that direction . But you changed that for me . You gave me knowledge of what would be . The life that I was supposed to have , the future that I built that you came from . A profound regret is what you spared me . I don 't think I 'll ever be able to thank you enough . Alec . The simple fact that you want to change is all the thanks I will ever need . I won 't let you down . I know . We don 't have much time . Go . Zorin says they 're close to opening the portal . And you should know they brought through reinforcements . How many ? Three . Carlos and the VPD will be hitting this place any minute . Your security team needs to do its thing and draw the soldiers into a two-front fight . Zach . I 'll prepare them . I 'm a man of my word . Not really . Alec , what do you need ? Access to the machine . I 'll need at least 30 seconds at the panel , assuming it 's straightforward . You know I 've always been an admirer of yours . Women like you are rare in any time . Past , present , or future . Whatever happens in there , I 'll always know I met my match in Kiera Cameron . Well , thank you . Don 't-don 't you have anything nice you wanna say about me ? Not really . I 'm going to go to the portal room , do some recon . You stay here . I 'll be back . Let 's get somebody on the north and south , we 'll need eyes on this entrance as well . Get eyes over here , let me know if you see any movement . We arrested him trying to get through our perimeter , says he knows you ? Yeah , it 's all good , Cuttlemans . What 're you doing here ? Warning you . I wanted to warn you . Kiera , Alec ... Those two of ours are inside . I 'll brief the squad . But there 's something else . The machine in there is essentially an anti-matter fusion bomb . Once those guns start firing , you could set off a chain reaction explosion . What kind of damage are we talking about ? Worst case scenario ... half the city . Ironic . What 's that ? This is near where you killed Lucas in cold blood . That was different . I don 't see how . You made your choice , now you live with it . It 's not always black and white , Kiera . You of all people should know that . Oh , that 's right . You 're either fighting for an idea that 's bigger than you , or you 're fighting for yourself . Which is it ? I 'm not sure . I am . You 're conflicted , Brad . You want clarity , and clarity is a luxury in this business . Time travel screws with our notions about what 's supposed to happen . It gives us a false sense of control , but really , we 're all just pawns . And all this ? This is to keep the darkness at bay . And you of all people should understand that . Marcellus lied to me . He told me we were building a portal to rescue our brothers and sisters from an oncoming massacre , but it 's a full-scale invasion . They want to bring the war to this time and win it before it even starts . Audacious . This whole thing is insane . So what do you want to do about it ? I want to prevent more suffering . Brad 's right . Mission priority : destroy the machine and the portal . What ? What about you ? If it 's my time , we 'll find out one way or another . But either way , change of plans . Carlos ? What are we looking at ? Piron security 's gonna let us in . The north west door . My guys will go through the machine room and hit them from the other side . Copy , north west door . Hey , Kiera , do we trust Kellogg ? I 'm not sure . Good luck , Carlos . Well , that 's my cue . I like to leave before the shooting starts , as you know . Goodbye , Kiera . It 's been ... well ... never mind . Sir ... I 'm here to offer my services , limited as they are . Bradley , let me see your firearm please . We can use every cop we can get . Gentlemen . So how long have you known about Kiera ? Long enough . Probably should have told you sooner . The old me would have screwed it up . I wasn 't ready to listen . Where the hell have you been ? Vasquez is dead . What ? And Kellogg ? I don 't know . He 's not where he should be . If something happens to him , this was all for nothing . Yeah , I know . Grimes , get your people ready . Somebody find Kellogg . I 'm on it . We can 't open the portal without all of them . I know . We need to buy ourselves some time . You know what to do . What are they up to ? I don 't know , but I don 't like the looks of it . Ok , there 's Carlos . Remember , do not hit the machine . Where are your men ? There . Alright . Here we go . We have contact ! Oh , shit . This is VPD ! Put your weapons down and lay face down with your hands on the floor ! Now ! Weaver ? Oh , no . What the ... ? NOW ! Take cover ! The Piron guards aren 't shooting . I know ! I don 't get it . Why aren 't your men firing ? Orders , sir . Who 's orders ? Mr. Kellogg 's orders . We need to bring in the others . Tether 's holding . But even if I can fix the key , we need that power canister . No ! Kellogg ! You were right . Predictable to a fault . I got eyes on Kellogg ! How do I get to his position ? Not on the blueprints that I have ! There 's a utility corridor that runs underneath the south wall . Follow me . Bradley , hold this position as long as you can . Let 's go ! Back up , back up ! We gotta go , now ! Back up , Kellogg . What are you doing ? What do you think you 're doing , Cameron ? I think you don 't want anything to happen to your supreme leader that might ripple into the future . Get out of my way , Curtis . Someone 's gotta put a stop to this . You 've never wavered , Jasmine . Never stopped fighting for the cause . You 're so focused you haven 't noticed that you 're already victorious . That might be so , but I 'm not going to let you or anyone else risk the lives of everyone in this timeline so that Kellogg can screw us all over . Kellogg has his own path that he must take . Neither you nor I can change that . I don 't remember being your hostage as part of our deal . And I don 't recall you mentioning your plan to time travel using the portal . What ? Now why would he do that ? Because he knows he 's screwed . In this time , and in the one that you come from . He 's got nowhere to go but backwards . You have been playing both sides since the beginning . That 's right . So why should I trust you ? Because I think you want what 's best for the protector as much as I do . She left 2077 against her own will and she 's done more to change the future than Liber8 could have ever done . At the end of the day she is our best weapon . Backwards ? What are you talking about ? You wait under that bridge for all of us to arrive from 2077 and then you kill everyone . You 're insane . No . Because then you start out with a clean slate and influence a young man in a barn . Well , now we can get down to business . You , fix the key . Now . I 'll kill him , right now . Will you ? 'Cause I don 't think you will . I think you need that portal open just as much as I do . I think you could have raided this place days ago , but you didn 't . You needed us to fix that machine . You sabotaged that key to stall us . Why ? So you could use the portal for yourself . Get down , get down ! Give him the key . Take it . Fix it . Weaver ? Move to the lower level . Let 's move ! Fix it . I 'm trying . Faster . I 'm trying ! The clock 's ticking . What is he doing ? He 's bringing his army . Done . Thank you . We have to stop them ! Weaver , take the kid . This invasion starts now . Carlos ! Gun ! Gun ! Kill everyone ! Weaver ! Dillon ! I choose me ! Kellogg , no ! No ! Kiera , the portal is collapsing . Kellogg destroyed that future when he went through . You 're gonna be ok , we 're gonna get you out of here , Jack . It 's now or never . Listen to the kid . Kiera ? Kiera , please ! No . Kiera , please ! You don 't have to say anything . I know . I 'll build you a better future . I 'll do it for you , Kiera Cameron . Thank you . Thank you . We gotta clear out of here . Everyone , fall back ! Fall back ! It 's a shame to lose Dillon and all those officers . For what ? Is Kiera dead ? Alec ? She might not be . The machine was tethered to my future . The future that was destroyed the moment Kellogg went through , allowing the traveller to return to his own time . What the hell happened to Kiera ? There 's no way to know . It might be another 60 years before we figure it out . Look , what we do with this is up to us . All of us . We have a chance to build something better . For her . No , except we 're screwed . Kellogg stepped through . Kiera had the notion that Kellogg would try something like this . We used Piron 's equipment to program Kiera 's time ball . By allowing us to have access to his system , Kellogg thought he could learn how to program his time ball , but instead it just allowed us to feed him the wrong information regarding how to select dates , which apparently he assumed was genuine . He might have thought he was going back to the day that Kiera and Liber8 arrived . But he didn 't . No . So where ... when did he go ? Oh my god . Oh , that little shit . No . No . No ! What does this mean ? I 'm not sure what you 're talking about . Liber8 won . What 's Liber8 ? No , wait . I remember the stories now . Uncle Julian used to tell me about his younger days protesting the old corporations . A barbaric and uncivilized age by all accounts . But you would know that , wouldn 't you ? You would have known him then . Kiera ? I missed it ! I didn 't want to miss it ! I warned you , Alec . I warned you , but as usual you don 't listen . It worked . I 've been waiting for you , Kiera . For 60 years I didn 't know if you died that day in the portal . That 's right , it 's me . The same one you left just a second ago , from your perspective . Alec ? Oh , Alec ! I know , you were just with me ! This is so strange . Imagine what it 's like for me . You did it . You did it . Sam ? Is he here ? I 'll take you to him . Emily lobbied City Hall for that before she passed . You were together ? Every day until the end . Police ? Not CPS ? CPS never formed . There was no collapse , no uprising , no revolution . No corporate congress . And no corporate congress . Julian and Edward and I saw to that . Amazing . It 's because of you , Kiera . And Sam ? Over there . Sam . I set the time coordinates as close as I could to the year you left . I knew you 'd have some adjustments to make . You 're not angry ? No , how could I be ? You 've given me the greatest gift . I have to see him . You made a better world , Kiera . What ? We thought you died that day . Carlos , Julian and I dedicated ourselves to building a better future . And we steered civilization inspired by your sacrifice . But Sam ? This is the price for making the world a better place . This Sam will grow up in a world free of violence , free of revolution , free of corruption . His future is bright . And it 's because of you , Kiera . That 's the price of love . Real love . You 'll understand in time . _

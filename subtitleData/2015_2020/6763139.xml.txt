 My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk . United Federation of Planets I 'm appearing before you , as a neutral representative ... Of the Fabonane Republic . And bring you a message of good will ... And present to you ... Esteemed members of the Teenaxiene delegation ... A gift from the Fabonan High Council ... With the highest regard . What 's wrong with it ? - Excuse me ? - Why don 't they want it anymore ? Well ... This was once a piece of an ancient weapon ... And now they offer it as a symbol , of ... Of peace . In the Fabonan culture this surrendal weapon ... Is an offer of truth . How did they come by it ? They told me , they acquired it long time ago . So they stole it , then ! No ... they uhm ... Well ... You don 't know the Fabonan like we do ! That 's very true . Your excellency , this gift ... They are crowds of untrustworthy thieves ... Who wants to see us murdered in our own base ... This beloved artifact is a symbol of trust and peace . They will cut us into pieces , and roast us over a fire ... I don 't think that 's true ... And eat us ! What ? ! Scotty ! Get me out of here ! Well , that was quick . There is quite a bit a surface interference , sir . Did it ! I ripped my shirt again . How 'd it go ? Captain , did you manage to broke a treaty with the Teenaxi ? Uhm ... Let 's just say we came out short . You look ... lock that ... In its personal vault , Spock . Thank you . - Jim , you look like crap . - Thank you , Bones . You have a little vein popin out of your tremble again . You okay ? Never better . It 's just a another day in fleet . Captain 's Log , Stardate 2263.2 Today is our 966-day in deep space . A little over 3 years of our 5 year mission . More time you spend out here ... The harder it is to tell where one day ends ... And the next one begins . It can be a challenge to feel grounded . When even gravity is artificial . But while we do what we can to make it feel like home . The crew is always continues to act admirably ... Despite the rigors of our extended stay here in outer space ... And the personal sacrifices they have made . We continue to search for new life forms in order ... To establish firm diplomatic ties . Our extended time in uncharted territories ... Stretched the ships mechanical capacities ... But fortunately , our engineering department led by Mr.Scott ... Is more than up for the job . The ship aside , prolonged cohabitation has ... Definitely ad effects on interpersonal dynamics . Some experience is for better ... And some for worse . As for me things have started to feel ... A little episodic . The further out we go , the more I find myself wondering ... What is it we are trying to accomplish . If the universe is truly endless , then ... If we 're not striving for something forever out of reach . The Enterprise is scheduled for re-provisioning stop at Yorktown ... Federation 's newest and most advanced starbase . Perhaps a break from routine will offer us some rest , but ... Not from mysteries , not the unknown . Sorry , I 'm late . Keenser 's leaking some kind hallious seed green go ... And Scotty is terrified , he 's gonna sneeze on warp core ... And kill us all . What the hell are you drinking ? Pretty sure it 's the rest of that Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus . My god man ! Are you trying to go blind ? That stuff 's illegal . Besides ... I found this in Chekov 's locker . Wow ! Right , I mean I always assumed he would be vodka guy ... Vodka guy . Exactly . I wanted to have something appropriate for your birthday . It 's in couple days , you know I don 't care about that . I know . I know you don 't like celebrating it to on the day ... Because it 's also the day your poop bit the dust . I was being sensitive . Did they teach you about better manner at medical school ? Or it 's just a sudden charm ? - Oh yeah . - Ooh . That 's good . Lordy . Are you gonna call your mom ? Yeah , of course I 'll call on the day . I 'm one year older . Yeah , that 's usually how it works . A year older than he ever got to be . He joined the Starfleet because he ... He believed in it . I joined on a dare . You joined and see if you can live up to him . You 've spent all this time , trying to be George Kirk ... And now you 're wondering just what it means to be Jim . Why you 're out here . To prove that aside and a full head hair . - Kirk here . - Captain . - Approaching Yorktown base . - I 'm on my way , Mr. Sulu . Let 's keep this birthday thing under wraps uhm . You know me . Mr. Sensitive . Woaah , that is impressive . Ay . She is a beauty , isn 't she ? What a damn monstrosity . Can 't we just wrap some space on a planet ? Showing geographical favoritism among conducted Federation worlds ... Could cause diplomatic tension . Oh , you don 't think that looks tense ? Looks like a damn snow globe in space just waiting to break . Ah , that 's the spirit , Bones ! Spock ! Do you have a moment ? Of course , Nyota . I think you should have this back . It belonged to your mother . It is not in a Vulcan custom ... To receive again that which was given as a gift . You guys break up ? What did you do ? A typically reductive inquiry , doctor . You know Spock , if an Earth girl says : " it 's me not you " . It 's definitely you . Excuse me . Commander Spock . Will you have a minute of your time ? Thank you for bringing me this , into my attention . Live long and prosper . Live long and prosper . Ambassador Spock 2230.06 - 2263.02 I have an alert of incoming vessel . Unidentified non-federation . Attention , unidentified vessel . You are not authorized for approach . Power down and wait instructions . Unidentified vessel , please comply . Just speak normally . Language analysis complete UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR We were on a science mission inside the nebula . Our ship suffered a critical malfunction . I took an escape pod . Before the ship crash landed on a nearby planet . We need a ship ... Capable of navigating the nebula . You must have someone , who can help us . We tracked her stranded ship through the sector of uncharted nebula . Here . 210 , mark 14 . Long-range scan ? No data . The nebula is too dense . It 's uncharted space . Well , the Enterprise does have the best navigational systems in the fleet . She can handle it . The only ship here , with more advanced technology ... Is still under construction . But it 's not just a ship that I am sending . I 'll gather the crew . Captain . Starfleet Command sent me your application for the vice-admiral position ... Here at this installation . Yes , ma 'am . If I may , I would recommend Commander Spock to ... Replace me as a Captain of the Enterprise . He is an exemplary Starfleet officer . He 'll make a great Captain . It isn 't uncommon , you know . Even for a captain ... To want to leave . There 's no relative direction in the vastness of space ... There 's only yourself . Your ship . Your crew . It 's easier than you think to get lost . - It 's not ... - I 'll bring it up with the General Council . We 'll discuss it , when you return . Mam . - Mr. Spock . - Captain . - I have something ... - Perhaps there ... - No , please . - Captain , after you . I insist . After this mission , we should ... We should sit down . There is something I need to talk you about . I , as well , have something to share . We make a good team , right ? I believe we do . I insist . Lt. Uhura , open a ship wide channel . Yes , Captain . Attention , crew of the Enterprise . Our mission is straightforward . The rescue of a crew stranded on a planet in uncharted space . Our trajectory will take us through an unstable nebula ... One which will disable all communication with Starfleet . We 're gonna on our own . The Enterprise has something no other ship in the fleet has . You . As we come to understand there 's no such things , the unknown . We 'll be temporarily hidden . Kirk out . Readings indicate cloud density diminishing , sir . This is Altamid . My ship is stranded here . Approaching Altamid . Class M planet . Massive subterranean development but limited to no life forms on the surface . Proximity alert , sir . We have an unknown ship heading right on us . - Lt. Uhura , hail them . - Yes , Captain . No response . I 'm picking up some kind of a signal . They are jamming us . Magnify , Mr. Sulu . What is this ? Shields up ! Red alert ! Fire at will ! Sir , our phasers are having minimal effect ... And our torpedoes can 't track their movements . Fire everything we 've got . Captain , we are not equipped for this matter engagement . Shields frequency has no effect , sir . They took out the DITCH . Shields are inoperable . - Warp us out of here , Mr. Sulu . - Yes , sir . - Why the hell aren 't we moving ? - I can not engage the warp drive , sir . Scotty , I need warp now . I can not , sir . They are gone . Security , engage all emergency procedures . All personnel to emergency stations . I have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15 , 6 , 9 , 31 and 21 , sir . Captain , it 's a 10 sec to reroute the energy residual from the warp core ... To the impulse engines . If we can get back into the nebula maybe we can lose them . Do whatever you have to , Scotty . Keenser ! Let 's go ! All clear , Krall . Connecting plasma pipes , stand by then you start it on my mark ! I have the Abronath . Secure the ship . - Captain . - Go , Spock . I 've identified the individual intruder and leading the attack party . They infiltrated the archive vault , and removed the artifact ... From our mission on Teenax . Hold your distance until ... Spock ! Spock ! You two , with me . Sulu , you have the cod . Yes , sir . My god ! The hell ? Doctor ? ! Doctor , we must evacuate now ! Captain ... Kirk . Yes ! We have 100 % impulse . Great work , Mr. Scott ! Maximum impulse towards the nebula ! Ay ! Krall , the ship runs into the nebula . Cut its throat . Kirk to bridge ! We are losing the inertial dampers . Systems are failing shipway , Captain . The emergency blockades are sealing ... But the structural integrity is at 18 % and falling , sir . Abandon ship , Mr. Sulu . Sound the alarm . We need to give those pods a chance to escape . Can you lead the ship away ? Impulse engines are still trying to draw power from the warp reserve . We can not move until the SAUCER is separated . I 'll handle it . Ay ay , sir . We got to get you guys to escape pod . Go . Ensign . Syl . I need your help . Yes , sir . My god ! Spock , they are taking the crew . Are you okay ? SAUCER should be free by now . I know , Mr. Sulu . The Captain should be there . SAUCER SEPARATION The impulse engines drawing power from auxiliary generators . Captain . How many of the crew are still pod disposal ? None . But if I 'm reading this correctly ... The intruders are taking them . Captain , we 're caught in the planet 's gravity . We can not pull away . Get your captain pods . - Yes , sir . - Ay , Captain . Come on ! Let 's go ! You knew ... You knew we would be attacked . You don 't understand . Captain Kirk . Yes , I lied . Our ship was attacked . Chekov , check your comms for survivors . Ay ay , ay Captain . - Who is he ? - His name is Krall . He took my crew , like he took yours . How did he know so much about the Enterprise ? All I know is that if I did this ... He 'll set them free . Chekov , are you picking anything upon those scanners ? Nothing sir . - What if they ... - No , no . He was taking them . We have to find that SAUCER even minimal scanning systems will have more range than a tricorder . Ay , Captain . It 's possible . Captain , I was protecting my crew . We 're searching for the captain . What is your name ? How do you know our language ? I know your kind . I 'm Lt. Nyota Uhura of the USS Enterprise . And you have committed an act of war against Fede ... Federation . Federation is an act of war . You 've attacked us . Your captain ... Why did you sacrifice yourself for him ? He would have done the same . And if he made it off that ship , he will come for us . I 'm counting on it , Lt. Uhura . I can 't believe it . My god , Spock ! Sit down over here . Okay , easy , easy . I 'll just a ... Try to relax . You 're going to be okay . Forced optimism in your voice suggests ... You are trying to elicit a sense of calm in order ... Cut the horse shit . Doctor . I failed to see how excrement of any kind feels relevant ... In our current situation . - What the hell are you doing ? - We must keep moving , doctor . Spock , this thing punched your iliac region . - Time is a critical factor . - That 's exactly what I am trying to tell you . Look , I can 't take this out . You are gonna die . Okay , if I take it out and can 't stop the bleeding , you are gonna die . I can 't see no appealing neither option . Believe me or not , neither can I. So , if I remember correctly . You got Vulcans of your hearts , where humans have their livers . That is correct , doctor . That explains some thing or two . You know , you are lucky . An inch to the left ... And you would be dead already . I just don 't get it , Spock . What did they attack us for ? I mean ... They do all this for some duedad with the tiny clevers didn 't want ? It is unwise to trivialize that which one simply does not understand , Doctor . We can safely assume that it 's more important than a duedad . I think you just managed to insult me twice , Spock . Alright , Spock . Just got one question . - What 's your favorite color ? - I failed to see the relevance ... Yeah , they say it hurts less if it 's a surprise . I made a doctor parlance with which you are familiar ... I can confirm your theory to be horse shit . We gotta get out of here . You 're kidding me , aren 't you ? Hello there . My name is Montgomery Scott ... and ... Who might you be ? Watch it sonny , I am pretty handy when I want to be ... right . No come back . Well , we surely showed them , Lassy . That 's Starfleet property ... You can not just ... But , I 'm feeling generous today so have at it . Where did you get that ? - Is that English ? - I learned it from my house . Where did you get that ? - This is my Starfleet insignia . - What does it mean ? Means that I am an officer of a Starfleet 's engineering division . - Engineering ? - Ay yes , I fix things . I know what is engineering . You 're not with those bastards who killed my ship are ya ? I take that as a no . He is Krall . Him and his ... bees . They searched the stars for ya . Death machine . They are the reason why you are here , why we are all here . Even those 3 scunners ? They have fallen from the sky , like me and you . Come with me . Now ! Wait , hang on a minute Lassy . I am in a difficult day here . I gotta fing my crewmates . I will help you find your mates ... and then you will help me . With what ? - You want me to fix something ? - Yes . You help me and I help you . Alright , well things being as they are all day , and I won 't get better offer today . So lead the way . Good . I am Jaylah . - And you 're Montgomery Scott . - Ay , Scotty . Come now , Montgomery Scotty . Alright , hold on . The Enterprise . It may not even have power to the bridge , Captain . She still has a few tricks up her sleeve . I bet on it . McCoy to Enterprise , come in . McCoy to Enterprise . Hey , take it easy there , Spock . That was just a temporary fix back there . I understand , Doctor . Fascinating . Omuns , dark , dangerous . We are going in . Intriguing . These symbols are the same as those that we picked on the artifact taken in the attack . You think it came from here ? It would seem so . Damm it ... Spock ! Hurry . - Aren 't we there yet ? - Stop asking that . - Sorry . - This is the way , come . Watch your steps , you do not want to set up my traps . Oh , that 's clever . What is this place ? - This is my house . - Your house ? Is this a ship ? I hope you find your friends and you help me fix it . So I can leave this planet forever . Wo ... Wait a minute . Is this your ship ? No , Montgomery Scotty . It 's yours . Oh my good lord . U.S.S Franklin Captain , it looks like there is power . Alright , let 's get to the bridge and find the crew . The console is intacted , and I will ... Try to reroute power to it . Work fast . Once we get this place run , we are gonna draw a lot of attention . What do you think ? You can find them ? Ay , Captain . I am reconfiguring scanners to modulate for the crews sequence . You with me . I left something behind . That is one heck of a cold . Nice job , Keenser . Alright , we got about 15 minutes until the next guard rotation . Come on . Let 's go , go . Come on ! This is a Magellan probe . Federation is using these to find a way through the nebula . What it is using it for ? What do you see ? He 's been pinging back in a subspace links between the probes . Well , use it to send a distress signal . I can try . Sent . He has access to Yorktown database . What ? That 's Startfleet datafiles ... Ship logs ... Including the Enterprise . He 's been watching us this whole time . Captain ... The artifact was on the ship the whole time ? I cannot afford to get caught with it . So I hid it in here . Tell Krall ... I have the Abronath . Do you really have my sad story you hear ? Not every . Put the phaser down . Please . You get it , Chekov ? Ay , Captain . I 've traced the location of her comm . What does Krall want with this thing ? To save you . From yourselves . Captain ! - You all right ? - Ay , Captain , but we are trapped . Can you get this thing started ? Are you intending inition ... Engage the thrusters ? I am open up for suggestions . Okay . - There 's the problem , sir . - What ? It 's the pipe . I can not get it to combust . Captain , we are basically standing on a very large bomb . If you miss the combustion compressor . I am not gonna miss , come on . Do you even know what the compressor looks like ? As squared , right ? No , sir ! It 's round ... That 's what I said . Chekov ! Chekov , move ! You think you know ... what sacrifice really means ? Federation has thought you ... that conflict should not exist ! But without struggle ... you 'll never know who you truly are . You have no idea who we are . But you 'll soon find out . You mean the distress signal you thought you sent ? The coordinates were altered . Your rescue ships will be stranded in the nebula ... And your base left , full open . You 're going to attack Yorktown . Millions of souls from every Federation world ... holding hands . It 's a perfect target . You are wrong . There is strength in unity . The strength of others ... Lte ... Is what has kept me alive . No ! Spock ! Spock , wake up damn it ! I am entirely conscious , doctor . I am simply contemplating the nature of mortality . You feel philosophical , huh ? Massive blood loss will do that to you . You asked me why Lt. Uhura and I parted ways . I became concerned ... In the light of Vulcans demise ... that I owed a debt of duty to my species . You thought you should be off making little Vulcans , huh ? Yup , I can see how that 'd upset her . I intended to discuss it with her further ... But I received some news which affected me unexpectedly . What news ? Ambassador Spock is dead . Spock , I 'm so sorry . I can not imagine what that must feel like . When you lived this many lifes as he ... Fear of death is illogical . Fear of death ... Is what keeps us alive . I don 't want to live as he did . That is why I decided ... To redirect my efforts and continue his work ... On New Vulcan . You are leaving Starfleet ? What Jim have to say about that ? I could not find the time to tell him . Oh , I can tell you he is not gonna like that . Hell , I don 't know what he 'll do without ya . I mean , you know , me on the other hand . I would ... I 'd throw a party . My god , you get delirious . How far are we from the coordinates from that call ? Still a way , sir . Captain ? When did you begin to suspect her ? Not soon enough . How did you know ? I guess you can say I got gut knows for danger . Run ! Is that music ? Where the hell is that coming from ? There . I found the little box in the power cell and delivering mouth like it sing . That 's very clever . Music is a bit old fashion for my taste . Not to mention very loud and distracting ... But hey , well played ! I like the beats and shouting . Well you do . - Switch it off . - Ah , it 's okay . Switch it off ! Someone set the foot on my traps . Captain ? - You know these men ? - Ay , Lassie . That 's wemanel is Pavel Chekov ... And that handsome bastard is James T. Kirk . They are my mates . It 's good to see you sir . - What is she doing Scotty ? - Just ... Don 't hurt them because ... You 're free , James T. Mr. Scott . Who 's your new friend here ? - She should have throw out the welcome mat . - This is Jaylah . I do not know what is a welcome mat . - You found anyone else ? - No , sir . I 'm sorry . You are the only ones . What the hell happened up there , Jim ? Why were we attacked ? They were after the artifact we brought back from Teenax . - Did they get it ? - No . - Have you got it ? - No . It did get off the Enterprise when it was in the shuttle . - You hid it in a shuttle . - Yes . And no . This is the USS Franklin , sir . Can you believe it ? The first Earth ship capable of warp 4 . Went missing in the Gagarin radiation belt in the early 2160 . I remember that from the Academy . Captain Balthazar Edison . It was his first year in Starfleet . How the hell did the ship end up here ? There is a lot of theories , sir . Surrendered to the Romulans . Captured by a giant green space hand . This farrer , must be a wormhole displacement . Can she fly ? She is missing a few drive decoys and EPS conduits are fried ... but Jaylah has done a marvelous job getting the ship systems back online . Thank you , Montgomery Scotty . Mr. Chekov , Can you plug in the coordinates ... See if we can track the crew 's location from the ship 's sensors ? Ay , Captain . He likes that seat . Mr. Scott , tour . Yes . The mess hall . Jaylah , get up . Yes . No clue what happened to the crew , right ? No , sir . They would be dead 100 years by now . Is that ... ? That 's a PX-70 . My dad used to have one when I was a kid . Mom saying back there it was driving her nuts . Sir . If you tell me this things has been here this whole time and ... No one has ever noticed it ? She sleeved up image reflectors . Alright , some sort of holographic camouflage . Ay , sir . Captain ! I intercepted a weak communication transmission , sir . It 's a Starfleet frequency . Can you locate the signal ? Yes , but how do we get to them ? I have an idea , sir , but I 'm gonna need your permission . Why would you need my permission ? Because if I mess up ... I don 't want it to be just my fault . McCoy and Spock Enterprise crew . Come in , Enterprise crew . Anyone . Come on , Spock . Come on , we can make it . Leaving me behind will significantly increase your chances of survival , doctor . Well , I stand sure that is completely out of question . It is imperative that you locate any surviving crew . No , I am sticking with you , I don 't care . Of course I care about ... I always assumed my respect for you is clear . Dialogue we have had across the years ... It 's okay , Spock . You don 't have to say it . Well , at least I won 't die alone . Well , that 's just typical . Come on you bastard ! Good to see you in one piece doctor ! Oh , am I ? I feel like my entrails were at barn days . I released old transporters were only ever used for cargo . But a few modifications seems to do the trick . I thought it was best to beam you one at a time . You know , in case you got displaced . Oh , I couldn 't imagine a worse scenario . Good to have you back . You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . He 's hurt . I am functioning adequately , Captain . In a pigs eye , you are . Captain ... We discovered that the stolen artifact appears to have come from this planet . Damn it , Spock ! Are there any medical supplies on this thing ? This way . Lay down , come on . There you go . How are we gonna get out of this hole , Spock ? We got ... No ship , no crew . Not the best odds .. We will do what we have always done , Jim . We will find hope in the impossible . Let 's get you patched up first , okay ? Captain . You must focus your efforts on helping the crew . That 's why I need you around Spock . This thing is from dark ages . Closer . I am pretty sure this is protoplaser . To stop the internal energy . At least that 's my hope . The miserable have no other medicine but only hope . Deathstorn is quoting Shakespeare . Captain 's Log , Stardate 2263.2 We searched the wreckage . He must have hidden it elsewhere . All we have is his crew , Krall . You will tell me where it is . Now ! No ! Stop ! Let him go and , I will give what you want . No , Syl ! Don 't ! Lieutenant . Unity is not your strength . It is your weakness . We should wait until we are absolutely sure . No , we have to get the crew back , now . Chekov has the coordinates that can lead us to Krall 's base , so we go . With respect , sir , how do we know that Krall was at the base when she called . And even if he was , we do not know if and the crew is with them . Or still alive . Mr. Chekov , Can you reconfigure the search parameters ... In order to compensate for this formula ? Ay , Commander but , what is this formula ? It is vokaya , Mr. Chekov . A mineral unique to Vulcan ... Which emits a low-level radiation . I 'll have to filter out all other energy emissions . Spock , what the hell would a Vulcan mineral be doing way out here ? Where are you going with this ? Lt. Uhura wears a vokaya amulet which I presented to her as a token of my affection and respect . You gave your girlfriend a radioactive jewelery ? The emissions is harmless , Doctor . But it 's unique signature makes it very easy to identify . You gave your girlfriend a tracking device ? That was not my intention . I am glad he doesn 't respect me . I am detecting a weary trace of mount of vokaya . Does the location match the coordinates you acquired from Kalari , Mr. Chekov ? It is a match , sir . It 's presence suggest that Lt. Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew are being held at Krall 's base of operation . Can we beam them out ? No , sir . There is some geological interference ... That is blocking transporter signal . Well I guess we are gonna have to go and break in the old fashion way . You can not go to this place . Everyone who goes there , he kills . You 've been there ? You 've seen it ? Why did you say something , Lassie ? Because I knew you will ask me to take you there . If your friends are there then they will die , just like my family . And I will not go back to that death place . If you escaped than you can show us the way in and the way out . No ! This is not the deal we made , Montgomery Scotty . If you choose to do this , you are on your own . - Wait , wait . - Let her go . She 's lost people too , Captain . Wait , that 's our friends out there Lassie , and we can not just leave them behind . We could really use your help . We just need you to be brave as all . When we run in that place ... Krall will come in and take someone . There were screams , I can still hear them . And we would not see that person again ... We did not know who would be next . My father planned an escape . But we were seen by the ... By the one they call Manas . My father fought him so I could get out . He was brave ... And Manas killed him . What you want is impossible . Maybe it 's not . Maywe granny used to say : " you cannot break a stick in a bundle " . You 're a part of something bigger now , Lassie . Don 't give up on that ... Because we are sur as hell , we 'll never give up on you ... That is what being part of crew is all about . Is that what you believe in , James T. ? All I know is , we stand a better chance with you . The diggind machines uncover the tunnel that goes into the crater that 's how we get out . Also that 'll be our way in ? The away team will beam to the other side of the tunnel , follow it across to the base ... Get inside the building , break out the crew . Captain , we can not locate anyone inside the crater ... In order to beam them out . Or , I can bring up pulse beacons to path enhancers . - That I get signal into the crater . - Alright . How many people can Franklin transport at the time ? With a minor modifications , 20 max ... But I am not sure how long it will hold out . Bones , Mr. Chekov and Jaylah , would be in the away team . Mr Scott , modify the transporter and do whatever you can to make this ship operational . Ay captain , Mr. Chekov 's technical acumen makes him more valuable on board the Franklin with Mr. Scott . Is there by logical that I would replace him . Why is that logical Spock ? You just got back on your feet . Lt. Uhura 's in that facility , Jim . I 'll keep an eye on him . Understood . His soldiers are everywhere . We won 't pass unseen . What we require is a diversion . I think I have an idea . This is Abronath . It was used by the ancient once as a weapon but when they could not control its deadly power ... They split it into two ... And rejected the halves into space ... Hoping it will be lost forever . But I am grateful . I have spent life times searching for . And only to have you find it for me . The poetry of fate . The world that I was born into ... Is very different from yours , Lieutenant . We knew pain , we knew terror . Struggle , made us strong . Not peace , not unity . These are myths the Federation would had you believe . Those are strong words . You may even believe them . But there 's something else going on with you . Something underneath . Wait . What are you doing with her ? You already got what you want ! Let her go ! No ! Manas . It 's time . The Federation has pushed the frontier for centuries . But no longer . This is where it begins , Lieutenant . This is where the frontier , pushes back . This way . Where is she ? I got to admit , that 's a hell of a distraction . Your friends are over there . Come on . Let me deal with them . You 've brought us this far . Finish the mission , Krall . Go ! Commander , Uhura they took her . Get the remain of the crew to safety . Come on . Let 's go . Move . - I 've got them , Mr Scott . - Okay , Mr. Chekov . Increase the signal . We are gonna grab them 20 at a time . - Ay . - Let 's hope this doesn 't get messy . Energize ! Spock ! What are you doing here ? Clearly , I am here to rescue you . Let 's go . Good to see you , man . You 'll die here as your father . Ten seconds until transporters recharged , doctor . Wait for my signal . - Doctor ! - Damn it man , we are not leaving without them ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Move ! Move ! We are ready for an extract , just turn on your beacon . - Scotty , you have everybody ? - Ay , sir . Everyones here except you and Jeylah . Start the beacon and we will grab ya . They will leave you here . Captain , your beacon ! - There it is ! - Energize ! Jaylah ! Okay , let 's never do that again . I agree , James T. You all right ? Captain this thing he has ... Yorktown . He is gonna destroy the Yorktown . You take my house ... And you make it fly . Mr. Scotty , can you get this thing started ? Start it , yes . Flying sir , that 's a different thing . These old vessel , they were built in space . They were never supposed to take off from the atmosphere . Make it happen . They are called Starships sir , for a reason . You tell me this now ? Because I didn 't want to disappoint ya . You know , in case we didn 't make it back . How thoughtful , Mr. Scott . Captain . He is launching . The attack at the Yorktown may be just the beginning . With this bioweapon ... He could get rid of all life ... And use the bases advanced technology ... To attack an untold number of Federation planets . We are just gonna have to get this thing flying . We can not just jump start it , sir . Okay , all systems online . Dilithium chambers at 70 % and raising . Primary subwarp engines standing by . Mr. Sulu . You can ... You know ... Fly this thing , right ? You 're kidding me , sir ? Fantastic . Scotty , how are we looking ? Ready as she will never be , sir . That 's what I like to hear . Alright . Bones , where are we with the crew ? I could use a functioning med bay ... But otherwise we are secure down here . Mr. Sulu . We have to achieve a terminal velocity ... In order for the stabilizers to provide lift . Are you sure this drop is high enough to do that ? We 'll find out . Call it , Mr. Sulu . Ay ay , Captain . Mr. Chekov , be ready to hit the forward stabilizers ... Full on my mark . One quarter impulse . Right . - One half impulse , Mr. Chekov . - Ay . We should belt up . Come on , move move ! Easy , Mr. Sulu . Let 's not break her now . Anytime , Mr. Sulu . Now , Mr. Chekov . I have an alert on incoming vessel . No reply on all frequency ID request . Visual . Red alert ! Red alert ! Look how far they 've come . I 'm picking up distress signals from every frequency coming from Yorktown . Krall is already starting the attack . Mr. Scott , what kind of weapons do we have ? We have pulse phased cannons and spatial torpedoes . Great . Lock and load . That does not matter . You can no defeat the bees . Maybe , maybe we will lore them away . How do we get Yorktown time to get people to safety ? We are on course and buggy competitors . We are barely holding together as it is , Captain . Captain . The flight paterns of bees are determined by individual decisions . Krall 's form formations are to complex ... Not to rely on some form of unified cyberpathic coordination . - Assuming that we could be ... - Spock . Skip to the end . What he is saying that if we disorient the swarm ... We can kick it 's ass . Precisely . Scotty , can you beam me onto one of those swarm ships ? Have you gone completely mad ? - Yes or no ? - No . Yes . Maybe . Captain , my familiarity with the interior of those ships , however brave makes me more qualified for this away mission . Spock , you 're still hurt . She 's right , Spock . I acknowledge and respect your concerns . Perhaps you will feel more confident if I were accompanied by someone with familiarity of both the ship and my injury . He is gonna love this . You want me to do what ? Come along , doctor . Whoo , wait a minute . Why you green-blooded ingrain This was your idea . It 's a good idea , Bones . You know , next time you have piece of pipes stuck in your trousers ... Call a plumber . Let 's make sure you find a way to break these things . If it gets heady I 'll beam ya straight back . Energize . It will be great ! Damn it , Jim . I 'm a doctor , not ... You do realize ♪ something something ♪ these things we crash . Hit something . Spock by Franklin . Spock , we read you . Captain , from what I can assertane , these ships do with the shared cyberpathic link ... Which coordinates their actions . Patching it through now . That 's what they signalize . They weren 't jamming us , they were talking to each other . How do we get them to stop talking ? What about an electromagnetic focusing ? We can use the transporters to disturb their network . Focus might be too specific . If you can plant some sort of disruptive communication signal inside the swarm it might inversely effect capacity the way it coordinates . It will have to be the frequency they will not anticipate . It will cause a chain reaction that will wipe out the whole swarm . Sir , a closed network like that might be sensitible to very high frequency . VHF . Radio . We can ... We can broadcast something from the ship ... To drawn out the links . Something loud and distracting . Loud and distracting ? I 've got just the thing . Do not break my music . Break it ? It will get an upgrade . Swarm ships in 60 seconds will break in through . I just got to reconfigure the VHF array range multiphasic swipe . - Let me do it . - No , Lassie I am in a hurry . Do it . There , see ? Simple . Alright . Captain , we are ready to broadcast . The signal won 't travel far , we have to get closer . - How close ? - Very . Intercept course , Mr. Sulu . My old friend . The swarms ships are doubling back there and forming a tech wave , sir . I think we got their attention . Hold steady , Mr. Sulu . Brace yourselves , everybody . Spock , stand by to drop out of formation . - Scotty , all queued up back there ? - Ay , sir . Ready to broadcast at 57.7 MHz . - Made your choice , Lassie ? - I have the beat and shouting . Let 's make some noise . That 's a good choice . Faster , Doc . We risk to be consumed ... By the trajectorial defects . Impact seat fibers . - Get ready , Doctor ! - God damn , I see it ! Is that classical music ? Yes , Doctor . It 'd seems to be . Lt. Uhura , make sure Yorktown has the frequency to broadcast . Sir , we now have the distraction frequency . Broadcast ! You 're all right , Spock ? We are fine , Captain . But there are still three ships heading into Yorktown . That 's got to be Krall . Keep on him , Spock . Do whatever it takes to stop him from using that weapon . My house is breaking ! Mass depolarization of hull plating . Maybe I can redirect the power from the dilithium chamber , but I need help . I need you , Jaylah . Let 's go ! Do not lose them , Doctor . We can always change places if you want , Spock . Captain , intercepting all three ships is an impossibility . Give me schematic of Yorktown . There . Yorktown headquarters . Mr. Chekov , can you do a bioscan on central plaza ? Ay . They are clearing civilians . Bones , there 's a city plaza coming up . You have to make sure Krall heads for it . - Why ? - Just do it ! Sulu , get us up there ! Hold onto something ! - Great work , Bones . - Thanks , Captain . Now I just have to figure out how to land . Captain , I have 3 hull breaches from the impact . Deck 3 , the cargo bay and the engine room . Alright , Sulu , Chekov , check the cargo bay and deck 3 . I need confirmation that the weapon has been neutralized and that Krall is dead . Captain . It 's Krall . We 've seen him do this . It 's a some kind of energy transfer , and it physically changes him . He must still be on board . No one seen him leave . Sulu , contact Yorktown security ... to lockdown the ship . Let 's go . Captain . Expand the frontier ... expand the frontier ... It 's him . Scotty , I need you to link to Franklin database . Find out what you can about Balthazar Edison . - What the Captain on a Franklin ? - Yes . He is long dead . No he is not . I do not know how , but Edison is Krall . What did you find ? Well , his records goes back when Federation didn 't even exist . He was a major in the United Earth Military Assault Command Operation . Along in the off-world combat . - He was a soldier . - Ay , sir . And pretty good one . His military service came to an end when MACO was disbanded . Why ? What happened ? The Federation sir , Starfleet . We are not a military agency . They made him captain and gave him a Franklin . - Scotty , bring up his logs . - Ay , sir . Captain 's Log ... The last entry . Captain 's Log ... I don 't remember the Stardate . All distress calls are nonsense . Of the crew , only 3 remain . I will only die . The indigenous race abandoned this planet long ago . They left behind sophisticated mining equipment and a drone platforms . They had some sort of technology ... That prolongs ... Life . I 'll do whatever it takes for me and my crew . The Federation do not care about us . Probably never see me again ... But if you do ... Be ready . Why has he not used his weapon yet ? Because he wants to find somewhere to inflict maximum damage . He needs a distribution system . Circulating area , right ? Ay , sir . There 's a atmospheric regulator core . Lieutenant , contact Yorktown ... Make sure they shut it down before it finds Krall . How we access the core ? Well , there is a maintenance tower at the stations gravitational nexus . That 's the only way . Scotty , get over there and make sure it gets shutdown . Lassie , with me . Look , this thing is impossible to shut down . Alright , well . Let 's see about that . Mr. Scott , why is that thing still on ? I 'm working on that , sir , but as you can imagine there are a lot of safety protocols , so ... Running the thing that you know keeps everybody alive . Figure something out ! Be careful captain . A gravity is gonna get a bit screwy ... The closer you get to the center . Maybe , we should scan the operations schematics . See if there is a backdoor . Lassie , I 'm gonna need your eyes . What happened when you were out there ... Edison . Edison ? I have to say Kirk . I 've missed being me . We lost ourselves , But I gained a purpose . It means to bring the galaxy extra trouble ... That makes humanity strong . I think you underestimate humanity . I fought for humanity ! We lost millions with the Xindi and Romulan wars . And for what ? For the Federation to sit in the captains chair . And break bread with the enemy ? We change . We have to . We spend the rest of our lives fighting the same battles . You lost ! You no way you can make to get back there . You are out . Like you did ? I read your ship log . Captain James T. Kirk . At least I know who I am . I 'm a soldier . You won the war , Edison . You gave us peace . Peace ... It 's not a world I was born into . - Scotty . - Captain . He is using the gravitational slipstream to get back to the center . No ! Weapon 's in the chamber . Captain we have to stop the processor now ... Or everything breathing in Yorktown is dead . You can 't stop it . You will die . Better to die saving lives ... Than to live with taking them . That 's what I was born into . - Scotty . - Captain , I think we can redirect it . There 's a seal construction , perhaps that will let you vent the weapon into space . Now we can override the locks , from out here , but you have to activate the hatch . - I just 've to hit the button . - It 's not a button , sir . It 's a simple lever under the white panel . - Got it . - And there 's 4 of them . Once you have activated lock , you 've to exit the chamber immediately . If the hatch is opened when the processors starts a next cycle ... You are gonna get sucked into space . What happens if the hatch isn 't opened ? You are gonna get sucked into big fan . With the weapon and we all die . Dammit , Jim , you won 't make it out on time . The vent . Get out of there , James T. Scotty , the last hatch won 't open . - Scotty . - Work fast , Captain . Time is running out . He is not gonna make it . What would I do without you , Spock ? For decades , the Federation taught that he was a hero . I guess time would judge us all . He just got lost . You saved this entire base , Kirk . Millions of souls . Thank you . It wasn 't just me . Never is . Needless to say the position of Vice Admiral , it 's yours . No one deserves it more . Vice Admirals don 't fly do they ? No . They don 't . No offense , ma 'am but ... Where 's the fun in that ? You didn 't even try to get our time up there reduced ? Why would I get it reduced ? Bones , we know our way through the nebula now . Can you imagine , what we 'll find ? Alien deathspots , Calvenom killing us . Deadly space worm , viruses and bacteria . Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies that could wipe us out in an instant . It 's gonna be so much fun . By the way , where 're we going ? I thought we were gonna get drink . I know you told me to keep it under wraps , but ... Happy birthday ! Mr. Sensitive ? Thanks , Scotty . Everybody raise your glass to Captain James T. Kirk . - Captain Kirk . - Thanks , everybody . - To the Enterprise ... - To the Enterprise . And to absent friends . Cheers . Alright , let 's get this party started . I thought you have to finish your mission report . I do . But I thought it would be more pleasing to engage with you socially . You 're old romantic . Do you know that scotch was actually invented by little lady in Russia ? Excuse me . Did you drink all those yourself ? I am impressed . Someone said that it will take my edge off . My edge is still not off . Alright , gold , maybe this will help . Captain pulled a few strings . That is acceptance into Starfleet Academy , if you want to . We have a lot rules . No less , no more . Will I have to wear that uniform ? I 'm afraid so . Hey , Keenser . Kevin , is there no way to wear pants ? I heard about Ambassador Spock . Is that what you wanted to mention ... that time in the turbolift ? More or less . I trust your meeting with Commodore Harris went well . More or less . You really want to head back out there , huh ? Space , the final frontier . These are voyagers of the starship Enterprise . It 's continuing mission to explore strange new worlds ... To seek out new life and new civilizations ... To boldly go where no one has gone before .

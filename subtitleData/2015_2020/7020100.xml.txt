Remind me your name again , sweetheart ? It 's Arlen . Let me ask you a question , Arlen . When you shit here in comfort , your shit goes away . - That accurate ? - I guess . You shit . It leaves . You know why it leaves ? Um ... Because , uh , the toilet takes it someplace ? Yes , it does . Takes it where it takes it ... Because of me . 'Cause I hate the idea that my sons and daughters would have to stew in their own shit . Cows stand in their shit . They stand in their shit ... 'Cause they 're cows . Pigs stand in their shit ... 'Cause they 're pigs . Some misbehaving humans been making hamburgers out of my sons and daughters . But we are not cows . We don 't stand in our shit . The reason we don 't ... Is because I won 't let that happen . I got each and every toilet in comfort taking that shit from all your little asses and sending it down the pipes till it reaches a place where no one thinks about it and no one smells it . Ain 't that nice of me ? But you don 't like it here , do you ? No , I just ... costs a lot to be here . Cost you an arm and a leg . Where would you rather be ? It 's all right .

Close your eyes . Close them . What do you really want ? I wanna be the solution for something . You know what this is ? It 's a tomato . First , it was a seed . You take care of a garden , and it takes care of you back . You feed it , it feeds you . Few things in this world operate like that , fair and square . It just needs a place to grow . It grows and grows . Then it comes out and it 's part of the world . Because you know what the dream really is ? It 's life . Life is the dream . The only dream . I want the dream . What dream is that ? This one here . Like they have . Make up a room for our guest . Is everything okay ? Hey . I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm just a bit nervous . That 's okay . Can you come in for a second ? Yeah , of course . Is this really necessary ? Come here , kid . We 're going . Bring her down ! You wanna see it all over your fucking walls ? Come here . Promise me something . You take care of this rabbit . Come on . Yeah . When we 're out and clear of the wall , I 'll let her go . Come here . Let 's go , kid . I 'm real disappointed in you , Arlen .

You can go . Go back to comfort . I 'm not going back there . In this place is only death for you . Is like that . Well , I like it here . What do you like ? Where is here ? Look around . Is nothing . I want spaghetti because the other man gave me spaghetti . I want spaghetti . I 'm hungry . I want spaghetti ! I want spaghetti !

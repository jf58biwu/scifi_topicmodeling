 [ alarm sounding ] [ COMPUTER SYSTEM ] Life support at fifteen percent . [ alarm sounding ] [ gasps ] [ alarm sounding ] [ gasps ] [ alarm sounding ] [ MAN 1 ] Okay ... okay ... come on . [ MAN 1 grunts ] [ COMPUTER SYSTEM ] Life support at thirteen percent . [ BOTH grunting ] [ alarm sounding ] [ MAN 1 grunts ] [ blows landing , grunts ] [ alarm sounding ] [ COMPUTER SYSTEM ] Life support at twelve percent . [ COMPUTER SYSTEM ] Restoring life support . What was that for ? You were in the way . [ guns click ] Who are you ? ! [ BOTH ] I don 't know . Who are you ? I got no idea . [ gasps ] [ gasps ] Shake ' n wake , tiny . Shake ' n wake . Who are you ? You don 't remember , do you ? No ... Well , hell . That makes six of us . What 's going on ? [ MAN 1 ] We all woke up , just like you . No memories . No idea who we are or how we got here . [ door beeps ] [ MAN 2 ] Hey , guys , check this out . [ MAN 3 ] What is this place ? [ MAN 1 ] It 's a ship . And looks like we 're dead in space . Systems were down and we were venting atmosphere . I was able to get us back on-line and restore the ship 's auto-repair protocol . How 'd you manage that ? I don 't know exactly . I was standing there at the console and it just came to me . Well , that 's a good thing . It 'll all come back to us eventually , right ? [ locker clangs ] Hey , if anyone 's feeling underdressed ... [ MAN 1 ] For now , we 've named ourselves by the order we woke up in . I 'm One . She 's Two . - - [ clanging ] - - [ MAN 2 grunts , growls ] Three . Four . Five . Which makes you Six . - - [ clanging ] - - [ THREE grunts , growls ] [ THREE ] Damn it ... We 've got comms . So what do you think ? We the crew of a transport vessel on some sort of long-range haul ? Would explain what we were doing in stasis . Ship gets into trouble . Takes some damage . Systems shut down . When life support hits critical , hazard protocols kick in and we 're automatically awakened . Wouldn 't explain the memory loss though . [ TWO ] Mmm . - - [ clanging noise ] - - [ THREE grunting , growling ] Got it ! So what are we shipping ? Seeds ? Meds ? Better . [ THREE chuckles ] Who wants ? [ gun clicks ] [ TWO ] I don 't think so . Hey ! [ gun clicks ] We 're gonna need to check this place out . Let 's pair off . Three you 're with Six , One with Four , and I 'll be with Five . We 'll use these comms to keep in touch , yeah ? - -Whoa . - -Oh , lordy . Expecting trouble ? Hopin ' . Are you gonna fix it ? I 'm gonna try . All I 'm saying is we don 't know how long we 're gonna be stuck here . It 'd make sense to choose a leader , y 'know , someone who can make key decisions for the group . Lemme guess . Someone like ... you ? No , not me necessarily , but yeah , somebody who 'll represent everyone 's best interests . Someone who 's got final say in case of disagreements . I don 't know . Could be me . ls that what you 're suggesting ? No . Just between us , if that was the case , I could use a good second in command . [ SIX ] Uh-huh ... [ THREE laughs ] [ SIX ] Now this is more like it ! I 've got to take this thing for a ride , man . [ SIX laughs ] Wonder if I know how to fly this thing . Knock yourself out ! She said " it just came to her " when she was standing at that console , but I did the exact same thing , trying to figure out what buttons to push , and nothing came to me . How do you figure that ? Hell , how do you figure any of this ? No way of knowing how long we were in those pods . Could 've been days , months , years maybe . Weird thing is it 's not like our minds have been wiped clean . If they had been , I wouldn 't know what a pod was , or a year , or even be able to express myself . Language itself would be totally alien to us , right ? [ ONE ] You 're about to blow my theory here . This way . Uh , why don 't you lead ? [ ONE ] Training room ? Or torture chamber maybe . You sure you know how to handle those things ? I 'm gonna say , yes . Hello , sweetcakes . [ THREE ] Hey , Tiny ! Get over here ! I found something ! Why 's that flashing red ? That 's strange . The ship 's computer just initiated some sort of security protocol . [ THREE screams ] [ SIX ] Hey , there . [ SIX grunts ] This is Six ! We 're under attack ! By Who ? Under attack by who ? [ TWO ] We need help , anybody ! [ ONE ] We heard , tell us where to go ! I can track your comms . Take the next right . " Wm Left at the next intersection . [ SIX yells ] [ SIX grunts ] Is somebody gonna die ? ! No , not if I can help it . [ SIX yells. grunts ] [ TWO ] Some sort of security protocol 's been activated ! [ FOUR ] Well , override it ! I 'm trying ! [ THREE grunts ] [ TWO ] Okay , I did at . Is everyone okay ? Yeah ... yeah . Took you long enough , doll face . [ THREE ] Guys we found food , who wants ? [ THREE ] Kid . Eugh ! You sure ? ! It 's close enough . What 's up with the robot ? Technically , she 's an android . Her bio-synthetic physiology is incredibly similar to that of our ship 's outer hull . Fascinating . [ TWO ] She 's an extremely efficient entity . Corrector nanites have almost fully restored her broken parts . Well that 's not a problem . We just stick her in the airlock and space her . [ TWO ] That won 't be necessary . I 've already deleted all of her security directives and re-established her base program . She 's no longer a threat to us . And she could prove useful . Whoa , we 're not waking that thing up . [ TWO ] The diagnostic suggests she possesses some sort of neural link with the ship 's mainframe . Once she 's back online , she 'll be able to run a more effective repair command ; she 'll have us space-worthy in no time . She may also have some answers for us if anybody 's curious . Okay . Start her up . Ugh . [ gasping ] What 's your name ? I possess no personal designation . Yeah , there 's a lot of that going around . Why did you attack us ? I have no memory of such an attack . The reboot must 've wiped her data stores . Well ain 't that convenient . - -Whoa ! - - [ SIX ] Hey ! I want you to initiate a neural link with the ship 's computer . Can you do that ? Of course . Now I want you to access any and all data related to the passengers onboard this ship . No such data exists . Any information in the ship 's records about its crew , or its mission ? No such data exists . How 's that possible ? I-It 's not . This ship 's programming is highly sophisticated . There are redundancies in place to guard against data loss . Someone must have deliberately deleted that information . [ ONE ] It wasn 't necessarily one of us . [ THREE ] Yeah ? Then who the hell was it ? It 's a big ship , lots of places to hide . Maybe there 's someone else on board . But they 'd have to know we 'd find them eventually so I 'm not sure what would be the point . We don 't even know for a fact if everyone 's really lost their memory . Any one of us could be lying about that . I don 't think so . I was the first one to wake up , I saw that moment in everyone 's eyes ... I don 't think anyone was faking . Exactly how long were you awake before the rest of us came to ? Couple of minutes at most , why ? [ THREE ] No way of proving that , of course , is there ? There 's no way for us to know what you were really up to . What exactly are you suggesting ? If one of us is responsible , I would say that you are the number one suspect . That 's ridiculous . Yeah . You could jump in here any time , you know . Chatty guy . Sleeping quarters . [ THREE grunts ] [ THE ANDROID ] My neural link allows me instant access to the system from anywhere on the ship . Manual guidance is not only unnecessary , but it 's also inefficient . [ TWO ] We 'll worry about that later . For now , I need you to run a full diagnostic and restore all systems . All right . [ TWO ] No . Show me . All right . What is that ? It 's a subspace transmission . The ship is broadcasting a distress signal . What 're you doing ? Nothin ' . What are you doing ? Looking for something to treat a headache . Headaches can be caused by blood vessel abnormalities or brain tumors . How do you know that ? I don 't know . I ... I just do . A tumor is a mass of cells that multiplies uncontrollably . The human body creates 25,000,000 new cells every second . And its kidneys process 180 liters of blood every day . Blood will spurt up to two meters when the carotid artery is severed . It 's a very efficient killstroke . [ SIX ] Uh-huh ... Yes ! It appears the ship has taken meteorite damage . So that 's why we were venting atmosphere . One of the forward relays was also hit , causing a power surge that damaged multiple systems . It will take some time to repair them all . Do we have engines and navigation ? Yes . What about weapons ? Ship 's weapons are down . Then let 's make that our next priority . All right . No . Show me . [ alarm sounding ] [ TWO ] What is that ? It appears another vessel has entered our scanning range . And their course ? They 're headed straight for us- - but I don 't believe they intend to render assistance . Why not ? Because they just launched missiles . Time to impact : 60 seconds . [ THE ANDROID ] Time to impact : 50 seconds . What can we do ? The ship is also equipped with various counter measures I can initiate . - -Would you like me to show you ? - -Just do it ! [ ONE ] Hey , sounds like they got the engines going . Yeah . [ THE ANDROID ] Based on our current acceleration , time to impact is now 40 seconds . We can 't outrun it ? I 'm already pushing our engines past maximum . [ TWO ] What about a jump to FTL ? [ THE ANDROID ] We don 't have time to execute the necessary nav calculations . Options ? I could attempt further evasive maneuvers , but at these speeds they may overtax our artificial gravity and inertial dampeners . Do it . What the hell ? Calculations complete . Jumping to FTL . [ BOTH groan ] Hey . Wh-Wh-What happened ? [ SIX ] We lost gravity for a few seconds there . When it came back on , we all took a tumble . You hit your head on the way down . - -I did ? - -Yeah . You okay ? [ FIVE ] Yeah , I - | think so ... [ ONE ] So , any idea who attacked us , or why ? None . [ THREE ] Maybe the robot had something to do with it . I have no intention of harming anyone on this ship . [ THREE ] Oh yeah , except for the part where you nearly killed us all . I have no memory of such an attack . - -So you keep saying . - -Alright , calm down . Are you kidding me now ? I wake up a couple hours ago , I got no idea who I am , how the hell I got here . Nearly get killed by the Forgetful Robot , almost blasted to scrag by some mysterious ship , and now we are floating in the middle of who-knows-where . Actually , we do know where . We 're on course for a nearby inhabited world . We are ? Before we were attacked , I initiated a recovery program in order to salvage recently deleted and overwritten data . You can do that ? [ THE ANDROID ] The process is time-consuming and most of the information is irretrievable . However , I have managed to salvage some data . What kind of data ? This ship 's original destination . We should be arriving in less than 12 hours . Y 'know the green ones aren 't that bad . They still taste like shit , but ... just not as much . You sure you 're okay ? Yeah . Still don 't remember hitting your head ? Nope . I just remember falling and ... then blackness . And--And the door . What door ? In a dark place ... underneath . [ FIVE ] A big , metal door . They keep it locked . Always . Why ? What 's inside ? Secrets . Fine , be that way . [ THREE yells ] [ TWO ] Everybody pick a room and get some rest . We 'll be dropping out in ten hours . [ THREE gasps ] You gotta be kidding me ... [ beeping ] [ beeping ] [ beeping ] Hi . Hello . So what brings you by ? What do you think ? We 're about to enter orbit . You 're heading down to the planet to look for answers . I suggest you wear pants . - -Hey . - - [ TWO ] Hey . [ SIX ] What happened to you ? I roll around a lot in my sleep . We tried communicating with whoever 's down there but received no response . Could be a tech issue . Could be a lot of things . Fly safe . [ SIX ] Damn . This ship have a name ? It 's a Phantom-class Marauder . Marauder ? Nice . There 's no reason to assume the inhabitants will be hostile . No reason to assume they won 't be . [ ONE ] Remember , we 're just looking for answers . We 're not here to cause trouble . [ MAN ] That 's far enough ! [ THREE ] Remind me to tell that robot I told you so . Who are you ? Why are you here ? Yeah , I was afraid those questions might come up . They 're not Corporate Guard . They could be Hrothgar 's people . [ MAN ] Did Hrothgar send you ? Maybe . We didn 't come here to hurt anyone . Or get hurt . Especially that last part . So why don 't we just lower our weapons ... All of us . You say your ship was attacked ? Well , we 're not exactly- - Raiders . Came at us out of nowhere , disabled our engines , looted our ship , left us for dead . You 're lucky to be alive . Wouldn 't be if we hadn 't managed to restore life-support . With nav systems down , we were flying blind we got lucky . Picked up your settlement on our long-range scanners . Wow , well , you 're welcome to re-supply , and help yourselves to whatever you need . But ... then you best be off . Why 's that ? We 're expecting trouble . This is an independent colony . We pull enough tarium out of the ground to get by , but we 've never been of interest to any of the big multi-corps . That is , until now . You hit a big strike ? [ MAN ] It was a couple of Ferrous Corporation geologists . Surveying the nearby asteroid belt . Apparently they hit the mother lode . But without a Hab-1 planet in the vicinity it would be too expensive to extract . They need a place to house the miners , grow food , source fresh water . Some place like here ? It 's a big planet . It 's not big enough so far as they 're concerned . The multi-corps don 't share planetary resources . It minimizes the risk of outsiders interfering with their operations . As long we work this claim , we have legal title . But if we were to leave , or if something should happen to us well , you get the idea . So that 's why you wanna be long gone before the Raza get here . The Raza ? [ MAN ] They work as enforcers for the multi-corps . They clean up loose ends , trouble spots--like us . They 're aliens . They 're half-man , half-reptile , and I 've heard that they 're over seven feet tall , and they have skin that burns to the- - The fact is no one really knows what they are , because no one 's ever survived an encounter with them . [ ONE ] If these Raza really are as dangerous as you say , why don 't you just leave ? [ MAN ] You don 't get to a place like this unless you 've already run out of options . [ GIRL ] Well , and this claim is all we have , we 're gonna fight for it . Aren 't you a little young to be doing any fighting ? I 'm old enough to wanna protect my friends and family . [ ONE ] No offense , but it doesn 't seem to me like you 've got the manpower or the firepower . We gathered together the last of our funds , sent out one of our people to score a shipment of arms . The real thing , like the weapons you carry . Enough for every man and woman on this settlement . A shipment ? When is it supposed to get here ? [ MAN ] Any day now . [ GIRL ] If it arrives in time , we 'll give the Raza more than they can handle , make Ferrous Corp. reconsider . Well ... good luck with that . Thanks . [ MAN ] Gentlemen . [ ONE ] That ... pendant , does it hold any special significance ? Hrothgar gave it to rne before he left . He said it symbolized freedom in the face of oppression and that when his people people arrived we 'd be able to recognize them cause they too would have this mark . Thanks . [ ONE ] This isn 't right . [ ONE ] Am I the only person who heard what they said ? A shipment of arms ? Obviously we were meant to help these people . You don 't know that . [ ONE ] And the fact that we have a cargo hold full of weapons , that 's a coincidence ? You 're forgetting one important detail : The scary lizard people that are on their way to this planet to destroy everything ! Guessing you don 't wanna be there when they show up . Okay , I admit , that part sounded bad . Let 's table this discussion until we 're back on the ship , all right ? [ TWO ] The Android said that console was fried . You really think you know what you 're doing ? [ FIVE ] Well , it 's like you with the controls , or ... Four with his swords . For me , it 's wires , circuits , fuses . I don 't know why , but it just kinda makes sense to me . Not like all the other stuff . What other stuff ? I see things , in my head . Like , while I was sleeping , I saw a dream . [ Two ] oh yeah ? I was walking on the beach with my little brother . He was crying ' cause he 'd gotten lost , but ... I found him and I was ... was bringing him back to the palace . The palace ? That sounds like a nice place to live . It was ... Till they murdered my father , and then came for me . But I was too much for them . And even though I could 've killed them , I didn 't . I just carved out their eyes and left them for my stepmother to find . The bitch ... I hope they 're bringing back some real food . I 'm starving . You , uh ... You carved out their eyes ? Well , it was me in the dream , but ... it wasn 't really me because it wasn 't my dream . Whose dream was it ? I dunno . But it was somebody 's . [ ONE ] I 'm telling you , we 're supposed to be helping these people . The matching pendants ? It can 't be a coincidence . All I 'm saying is even if we 're supposed to be helping these people , which I doubt , doesn 't mean we 're gonna do it . We don 't even know what happened to us , or how we 're gonna get our memories back . And those weapons would fetch a very good price on the open market . The money would go a long way- - Except they 're already paid for ! They belong to the miners . Doesn 't matter if they belong to the miners ! They 're in our cargo hold ! They belong to us now ! Those people will die if we don 't help them . They 're already dead . Doesn 't say much . When he does , it makes sense . If their enemy is even half as powerful as they believe , then they 're doomed . The least we can do is give them a fighting chance . I 'm pretty sure the least we can do is nothing . Which , for the record , is what I 'm suggesting we do . All right . Let 's put it to a vote . Fine . I vote that we keep the weapons , we sell them , take what we make to stay alive , and find out what the hell happened to us . Agreed . I think we do what we know we came here to do , complete the delivery . He 's right . I say we help those people . Thank you . Yeah , me too , I wanna help those people . Wait a minute , she can 't vote . Why not ? 'Cause you 're a kid ! She 's a member of this crew . Who 's a kid ! What are you , like , 15 years old ? Do we really have to have a vote to decide if she gets to vote ? ! I vote against her voting . [ FIVE laughs exasperatedly ] Come on , throw up with me . [ THREE ] Fine , three to two . What do you say , boss lady ? Set half the crates aside . The rest go down to the surface . [ THREE ] Clean up your tray , pretty boy ! [ THREE ] Make sure to lift with the back . Helps take pressure off the knees . You know what would take the pressure off my knees ? You helping out . Yeah , see , I think that 'd be kinda hypocritical given the way I voted and all . Yeah , I wouldn 't worry . I don 't think it 'd be possible for us to think any less of you . Well , you never know . I might surprise you . All right I think that 's it . We 're good to go . Who 's that ? [ THE ANDROID ] I don 't know . The file is corrupt . This has been a difficult and tedious process . However , I have managed to recover a sizable data cache . Let 's see it . [ TWO ] I need everyone on the bridge , now . What 's the matter ? [ TWO ] Just get up here . What 's going on ? The Android managed to recover a significant amount of data related to this ship and its crew . Well , that 's good . Isn 't it ? Marcus Boone : Murder , assault , kidnapping , piracy . Griffin Jones : Murder , assault , smuggling . Jace Corso : Murder , assault , kidnapping , trafficking , theft . Ryo Tetsudo : Murder , assault , piracy . [ THE ANDROID ] Portia Lin : Murder , assault , arson , theft , piracy . Turns out the Raza aren 't a race of aliens . " The Raza " is the name of this ship . We 're not here to help these people . We 're here to kill them .

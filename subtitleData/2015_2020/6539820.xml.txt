 Now , can I count on your support for school trustee ? I 've been thinking of running against you . We can 't afford a campaign . We would like to buy your business . She 's the midwife . You 're doing very well , and you 're very strong . You 're not locking Gracie up any more . Run ! ART : She says they have the same tattoo , picture of a two-headed horse . MRS S : It was the only way I could see to get you out of Dyad . SARAH : Betray my sister ? For Kira . That 's not your bloody decision ! What the hell 's going on ? This is Seth . They wrote down all my information in this little notebook . And then Seth yanked out a piece of my hair and put it in a bag . KIRA : Mommy . Duncan had tissue samples of the CASTOR original . ( GROANING ) My people will get you out of the country . Now we find Helena and we finish this shit . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) We should close his eyes . Yeah . - Do you want a drink ? - Yeah . Okay ... S. S is gonna know how to get rid of it . Either that or someone she knows well ... I 'm not asking her for anything else . Then fine , I 'll ask . So , I 'm gonna need a bath after we 've cleaned all of this up . Jesus Christ ! What a mess . ( POUNDING ON DOOR ) ( POUNDING CONTINUES ) - ART : Sarah , we need to talk . - ( SOFTLY ) Shit ! - Art , it 's not a good time . - ( WHISPERS ) Talk to him ! - Why won 't you talk ? - ( WHISPERS ) Because he knows me ! - Sarah , I 've got something . - SARAH : Yeah , just a second . FELIX : I 'm really sick . I 've been throwing up for hours . - Open the door ! - SARAH : Art , one second . One sec . - Yeah . - ( FELIX GRUNTS ) - Hey . - Hey yourself . What 's going on ? It all depends . What 's with you ? Nothing . FELIX : Hello , Arthur . - Felix . - How you doing ? What 's up ? What do you need ? FELIX : Oh , that . Yeah . That 's a new project . That 's very fresh . SARAH : What ? - SARAH : Art . Hey ! - Art . - Art , do not go in there . - ART : What is that ? - Art ! - ART : What ... SARAH : ( SIGHS ) Okay . First off , it wasn 't us . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) Ripped By mstoll Do you understand the position this puts me in ? We do , Art . But can 't you just , like , look away ? It 's a dead body , not a bag of weed . Well , look away and it too will go up in smoke . Very professional , nothing on you . - ( SCOFFS ) - SARAH : Hey , Art . I 've got someone who wants to meet ya . Hi , Art , I 'm Cosima . - Welcome to clone club . - Oh , shit ! I know . Sorry . ( STUTTERS ) I knew Beth . I knew what she was going through . We really miss her . Yeah . Yeah . Me , too . Um , Cos , what 's your take on these glitchy bastards ? 'Cause this one 's not talking . ( COSIMA SIGHS ) You said they were looking for samples of their original , that 's very interesting . Um ... - Oh . Yeah , here 's Scott . - Hey . - Hello , Lieutenant Scotty . - Don ' t call me that . COSIMA : No , he 's like barely a Trekie . He only went to Comic-Con , like , once . And it 's " Lieutenant Commander " . Yeah . Anyway ? Basically , dead guy 's symptomology sounds like they have a design flaw . - Yeah , like me . - Only neurological . Which explains why they need the original genome , to find a cure . But that 's just hypothetical unless ... - Unless what , Scooter ? - Don 't call me that either . Unless we examine his brain . His brain ? FELIX : Okay . Well , chop-chop then , get over here . I don 't want any part of this . Sarah , come here . - Do you wanna see the body again ? - COSIMA : Yeah . I really shouldn 't be doing this . You don 't have to . You just got back on the job . Which is how I got a lead on the Prolethean , Mark . You did ? ( BREATH ES SHARPLY ) Gracie ? ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) ( KNOCKS ) Gracie ? ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Come inside . GRACIE : I went to get us breakfast . Please , don 't leave without me . It was just across the street . The baker had a turban . He said he makes the best cinnamon buns in the whole county . Your family will be looking for us , Gracie . Damn them , if they want to ruin our honeymoon . There 's a whole world out there . Why are we here ? I told you , we 're just laying low . You sat up again last night . Why won 't you come to bed with me ? It 's not a sin . We 're husband and wife . I know . It 's just ... You can share your secrets now . ( CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) Hey , say no to bullies on the board or in the class . I will speak to your children so you don 't have to . Hello , Vera . Could I talk to you about Marci Coates ? She plans to re-zone the district . And have you seen her lunch proposals ? Nothing but starches . Sorry , I can 't . You don 't have five minutes to talk about your kids ' education ? Alison , honestly , someone with your issues handling my children ? Of course . No , I understand . Uh , we have something for you from Ramon . We took over his business . Bath beads , body lotions , anything you need to relax . - ( CLEARS THROAT ) - Oh ! Here you go . - VERA : Thank you . - Here you go . - Uh-oh . - Oh ! It 's 60 now for the soap . Though we do offer discounts for referrals . So , can I count on your support ? Well , tell me about this re-zoning thing . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) At the military academy the other boys did the sex things . ( CHUCKLING ) They 'd chase girls . But not me . I was waiting . I know this town . Willard Finch lives here . We 're not just laying low , are we ? Gracie ... I 'm not who you think I am . I told your father that I went AWOL , but the truth is that ... I never left the army . What do you mean ? It 's all about your father . He stole valuable scientific material , I was assigned to recover it . ( SIGHS IN DISBELIEF ) We brought you in . - Trusted you . - Gracie ... - All those years ... - I 'm sorry . - It was all a lie ? - No ! Gracie ... ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) We are free of your people , but we are not clear of mine . I have to find something for them and then I can get out . That 's why we 're here ? You 're looking for something my father stole ? You think Willard Finch has it ? I think that he hid certain things for Henrik . Gracie , you had to know that your father had secrets . No , I don 't know ! I don 't know anything ! Gracie ... ART : Don 't ask me what for , it 's personal . He has to be back by the end of the day . ( SARAH SIGHS ) Beth couldn 't keep still either . Well , it just doesn 't seem like these people get downtown much , does it ? Yeah , well , they all scattered after Helena torched the ranch . So , the samples that these CASTOR guys are after ? Yeah , from the original . Blood slides and skin samples , that 's what Cosima said . So , what ? You think that if you find them first , you can trade Helena for ' em ? Right . Hey , that 's the midwife . Here we go ! Alexis McGann . Recognise me ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) I 'm looking for my sister . I don 't know where Helena is . I was cast out because of her . SARAH : Well , I don 't give a shit . What about him ? Mark fled with Gracie . He betrayed the family . Wait , he 's with the daughter ? Are they the ones that took Johanssen 's truck ? Mmm-hmm . SARAH : Hey , look . Johanssen did something to my sister , what did he do ? She has a special purpose . Well , I don 't know what that means . What does that mean ? He harvested her eggs , and she 's pregnant with his child . Helena 's pregnant by him ? It 's a miracle . I didn 't know he would do it to Gracie , too . WOMAN : ( ON RADIO ) 55 , that vehicle was ticketed for speeding in Halton yesterday at 18 : 44 . - 55 , roger . - ( RADIO BUZZES ) All I regret is breaking bread with abominations . Oh , trust me , if Helena 's an abomination , - I 'm much worse . - Hey . Next time she 'll bite your head off . MARK : Gracie , I 've gotta go and do this . This child inside me you know what it is . Yes . I can 't do it alone . I 'll be there for both of you . I swear . Then let me help you . Willard Finch is a dangerous man . If he was hiding something from my father , he 's not just gonna hand it over . I can take care of myself . The last thing we need is another violent mess . Have you got a better idea ? ( DOG BARKING ) What ? ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) ( BRAKES SCREECHING ) ( DOG CONTINUES BARKING ) Hello , Mr Finch . Remember me ? Little Gracie Johanssen . You really have blossomed . Yes , sir . Thank you , Mr Finch . - Just gotta say it was a ... - ( ROD CLATTERS ) just a damn shame what happened to your daddy . ( LOCK CLICKS ) He was a good man , your father . He always spoke well of you , too . Kept you under lock and key , though , these last few yea rs , didn 't he ? - We have our ways . - Uh-huh . Well , I remember a time when he used to bring you up here . I used to play in your fields while he did business . That 's right . - Which is why I 'm here . - Oh ? To collect what you held in trust for him . There is a storage fee that 's applicable here , it 's $ 1,000 . - I don 't have it . - Ooh ! That 's gonna be a problem . The problem , Mr Finch , is your lack of faith in us . We Proletheans make fast friends but fearsome enemies . Shall I disrupt my mother 's grief to tell her that you 're holding out for your 30 pieces of silver ? You be sure to give your family my condolences . Of course . ART : So , why did Mark take the girl ? SARAH : He wanted a chew toy . ART : Oh , come on , think like police . Why take baggage on the run ? Love , or a hostage ? I ... Art , shouldn 't you be getting back to your real job ? Johanssen was a large animal vet in Halton in the ' 80s . You 've got to read the entire file . He 's a KA . Known associate ? Seriously , why are you doing this ? I don 't know . 'Cause I 'm riding with my partner . - Art . - Look , I 'm not confused , Sarah . But you are Beth 's sister through and through . You didn 't even know her . This isn 't your fight . You know , she tried to tell me . What she was . She called me the night that she ... The night she came along and ... I thought it was the pills , more bullshit . I turned my back on her when she needed me the most . You couldn 't have known . Yeah . But I should have . She was lucky to have you . Just look up that asshole KA for me . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Let 's get your sister back . ( SINGING INDISTINCTLY ) ( MAN SHOUTING ) ( ENGINE RUMBLING ) Ma 'am , I can explain . ( GRUNTS ) - You killed your brother ! - Virginia , calm down . He was stage five in the field . I had to . If you had followed Major Dearden 's extraction orders , he would have been at home . I 'm sorry , Mother . I 'm sorry . Hey , he screwed up , but he had to put Seth down . It 's protocol . My office . Wait for me . Oh , shit ! Come here , Doc . ( SIGHS ) Bless you , Paul . PAUL : Oh , yeah . I 'm blessed all right . MAN : ( ON RADIO ) What 's you 20 ? MAN : Yeah , that 's us . Systems and weapons check , right ? It 's getting worse , isn 't it , the defect ? You saw it ? Seth went from asymptomatic to stage five in a day . What about Helena ? Any help ? We did the stress tests , the NeuroCog , she doesn 't have the defect . Her biology may hold answers . But the fastest way to a cure is still the original genetic material . Well , I run field operations . I want Rudy confined to the base . But I run the programme . We 've lost contact with Mark , I need Rudy back in the field . I 'll go after Mark . ( SCOFFS ) You can 't . It gets worse . The Director wants you in Arlington . Our weapon system has a glitch , Paul . We are one budget review from oblivion . They can 't shut us down . ( SCOFFS ) I serve with these men . We owe them . If you can protect them , I can cure them . Just buy us more time with the Director . ( SAW WHIRRING ) You okay , Scotty ? ( GRUNTS ) I could barely get through the scalp , man . Oh , God . FELIX : Go easy on him , Cosima . Scott 's not a hardened criminal like you and I. Once I got to the calvarium I just ... - Scalpel ? - SCOTT : Yeah . Hey , you have done this before , yeah ? - ( COSIMA GRUNTS ) - YouTube is an amazing resource . COSIMA : Scott ? No sign of aneurysm . No , no lesions . God , is this all we are ? ( SCOFFS ) SCOTT : Huh ? I mean , some neurons , and axons , and a few pounds of grey matter . How about we just get it back to the lab ? Yeah . But , like , when he died you think what he saw , it was just a temporal lobe trip ? - ( SKIN SQUISHING ) - Oh ! Or did his soul actually say , " I 'm out of here . I 'm out of this dimension " ? SCOTT : Please , Cosima , this is weird enough . Scott , a good lab partner should be metaphysically empathetic . Tongs or spoons ? - Ah . - Oh , my God ! Well , I looked . I shouldn 't have looked . COSIMA : Okay . - ( GRUNTS ) - FELIX : Ugh ! Oh , bollocks . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Receptacle . Hey . You all right there , Igor ? Still with me ? ( GROANS ) Tell me what you see . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Bi ... Bird . Um ... Star . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) - Knife . - Close . Key . Your aphasia 's improving already , and so are your motor skills with the help of art and physiotherapy . ( STAMMERING ) Outside . Sadly , the Rachel Duncan Topside knew has passed . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Plane crash . Delphine ? Um , I finished ? ( INHALES SHARPLY ) Let 's focus on your recovery . You 're more valuable than you know . Horses . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) ( HELENA COUGHING ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( CONTINUES COUGHING ) Clear the room . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO ) At ease . Man , I thought you were really mad at me . I am . Your logs . Sit . Her name was Patty . Mark 's gone dark . Man , that guy is such a pussy ! Don 't underestimate him . If he 's off task , just bring him home . And the Major ? I 'll handle the Major . Mom ? I saw that star in Seth 's eyes . - Oh . - They took him so fast . ( SOFTLY ) Come . If there was any chance that Sarah still had the samples ... I had to try . My boy . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - Alison , hi . - Hi ! We heard about your new business . Yeah . Could we maybe get some ... Soap ? Yes . We actually have a special for new customers . Free sample ? ( CHUCKLING ) Sure . ALISON : How about you ? Yeah ? Have you two made your decision for school trustee ? We 're still thinking about it . ( CHUCKLES ) Don 't think too hard . Soap is the perfect cover . - Ali , we 're gonna break even in months . - Mmm-hmm . We should have been drug dealers years ago . Mmm-mmm . Pharmaceutical entrepreneurs , Donnie . As long as every new customer is a vote against Marci flippin ' Coates . - ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) - Hello ! Hi , Marci . Oh , the kids said that you were in the garage . You shouldn 't be back here . There is fumes and lard . Well , this is , uh , quite the operation . I had no idea soap-making was so involved . Would you like a lesson ? Enterprising , and a head for politics . That 's quite the dark horse . What 's her secret ? Oh , you know , just good old-fashioned stumping , Marci . We can 't all be the incumbents so some of us have to work for it . So , Alison , I have a little proposal for you . ALISON : Hmm . I can get you an amazing deal on this house . The sellers are very motivated . This is in a different school district . DONNIE : Honey , they have a salt-water pool . - Oh , look at that . - Donnie ! ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Look , Alison , you can buy a few votes with your soaps and you can quite possibly carve out some of my support , but you can 't actually win . Go sell a house , Marci . Do you seriously think that people are gonna trust their children to an infamous alcoholic ? ALISON : Why not ? They trusted a conniving second-rate realtor . May the best woman win , Alison . Goodbye , Marci . I need to cut something . ( BARKING ) ART : Drop your accent , this isn 't Scotland Yard . Willard Finch . WILLARD : This is private property . Well , you 're a long way from home , son . That 's funny . I don 't look a thing like your son . That you wouldn 't . We 're hunting this guy . - Can I ? - Yeah . Nope . I don 't know . He 's travelling with the daughter of Henrik Johanssen . Who 's that now ? Henrik . He was part of your little militia back in the day . " My little militia " ? ART : You remember ? Back when the Feds dug up all those guns in your cornfield . What 's your point ? One tip to the Feds , and they backhoe the whole thing again , looking for your little arsenal . ( SIGHS ) Okay . I don 't know your friend here , okay ? This idiot , I don 't know . But that daughter , young Gracie , she did swing by . What for ? Just to pass on the sad news . Women running things over there now too , huh ? What is this world coming to ? Is there anything else ? Bye . We 'll be in touch . You 're banished . We have no use for a midwife . Wait ! I know where Mark may have taken Gracie . ( BOX JANGLING ) ( MARK BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( LOCK CLICKS ) MARK : It 's just junk ! ( STUTTERS ) There 's no test tubes , no slides ? This is what he gave me . Biological samples need to be kept cold . Did you see , like , a tank or a cooler ? - No . - Think , Gracie . I don 't know . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Okay , it 's okay . I 'll just ... I 'm just gonna have to go back myself . No , Mark . - ( GUN COCKING ) - MARK : Don 't worry . It 's too risky ! You know what ? just , um , go down and treat yourself to something special . I 'll be back for you in an hour . Come home safe . Okay ? Don 't you dare leave me alone . I won 't . Never . ( DOOR OPENING ) ( DOOR CLOSING ) We 've got , like , six hotels . They won 't give you anything over the phone . You 've got to go in , show them his picture . ( CELL PHONE CHIMES ) ( SOFTLY ) Shit ! Hey , you 've got real fires to tend there . I 'll finish the canvas and you just go back . I 'll take the bus back tonight . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) I showed you a dead clone in a tub this morning . No , you did not . Just tell me you 're not risking your job being here . Hmm ? You know , I may not be your partner , but I know when you 're holding back . Beth called you that night , not Cosima , nor Alison . What is it you 're not telling me ? Just say it . I 've never said it . You were in love with her . She was my partner and we were never gonna be together , but it happened . You 're just as fierce as she was , Sarah . And you need my help , too . You 're no good to us suspended . We need you as a cop . Beth would want that . Be careful . Okay ? We 're fierce , remember ? Call me if you need me . Don 't leave it too late . I thought you 'd smell like Sarah . HELENA : Another one . You are the ugliest Mark yet . Tell me something , Sarah Manning , the gatherer of sisters , but when she sold you out , when she gave you to us , that must 've been quite a blow . You come inside , I tell you about it . Well , sweetheart , there is nothing more that I would love . PAUL : That 's enough ! Just getting to know the enemy , Major . You have an assignment . I will brief you so this time you don 't stray . - Sir ... - ( HELENA TSKING ) HELENA : Dirty Paul . He lies with my sisters , even Rachel . Come inside . Have another . You won 't believe me , but I am sorry it has come to this . Mmm . One day , I kill you all . ( IMITATING MACHINE GUN FIRING ) Forgive me my trespasses against the family , Lord . Please keep Mark safe , and help guide us through this uncertainty . Amen . Do you know who I am ? Are you Sarah ? Helena told me about you , I didn 't really believe her . Yeah , she tells some nutty stories . I 'm lookin ' for her . You 'll have to try at the ranch . - I don 't know where she is . - And Mark ? He and his brothers know where she is . My husband doesn 't have any brothers . Husband ? - Congratulations . - Thank you . You 're the first person I 've told . Did Helena tell you I have a kid ? Yes . My kid and yours are going to be cousins . I know you 're carrying Helena 's baby . That does not make us family . Why , ' cause we 're abominations ? I don 't really know what to think any more . Yeah , there 's a lot Mark 's not telling you . He was sent by the army . He had to collect scientific material from my father . I know . He told me . ( PAPER RUSTLING ) Didn 't tell you about his brothers , though , did he ? There 's probably more of them . ( GASPS SOFTLY ) He 's ... He 's a ... - Hey , hey , hey ! - ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) Look . Helena 's the mother of your kid and she 's in trouble , I need to know where Mark is . WILLARD : Gracie took everything . All right ? We got nothing to talk about here , kid . Just ... You go and tell Bonnie that , would ya ? MARK : Bonnie didn 't send me . In the field there are only two types of prisoners , assets and liabilities . Ahh . Ow . Ow . Ow . Okay , okay . Okay . Be an asset , Willard . Where are the rest of Henrik 's things ? Okay . I don 't know any more than what I told ya . ( SCREAMING ) Where ? - Willard ? - ( CONTINUES GROANING ) Hello , Gracie . Mother . Your family cares for you , Gracie , even as you refuse to care for yourself . You 've been crying . I made a mistake . Mark , he ... He took advantage of you . Yes . And your stupidity . We let a wolf into our flock , and you ran . I had doubts , Mother . When your father told me that you would be the one to carry the child , I ... I struggled . Lord , I struggled . But , you didn 't stop him . We 're not like other people . We have a purpose . We still have a purpose . SCOTT : It 's like Swiss cheese in here . Amyloid plaques , rampant cell death . Like spongiform encephalopathy ? SCOTT : Yes . Like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . He wouldn 't have lasted a week . No wonder they 're so motivated . ( COUGHING ) - Assays done ? - A few , yeah . Just cross-referencing against LEDA DNA . Let 's see if it brings up a new synthetic sequence . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) - Scott ? - Hmm . Hello ? ( CELL PHONE VIBRATING ) - Hello . - COSIMA : Hey . You 're not gonna believe this , um , ' cause I don 't either . But I just thought with a few 100 matching base pairs , but it 's almost half a gigabase . Uh , not a good time , Cosima . Tell her about the loci . Yeah . A dozen short tandem repeat loci in common . That can only mean one thing , Sarah . In English , I hope . The boy clones are our brothers . What ? ( CLANGING ) ( SOFTLY ) Shit . Shit . I 've gotta go . Sarah ? ( CALL DISCONNECTS ) SARAH : Hello ? MARK : Heart attack . I thought he could take it , but he must have had a heart condition . How did you find this place ? I had a chat with your blushing bride . Gracie ? What did you tell her ? She knows you 're like us . She knows you 're just like us , a clone . What have you done ? What I had to to get Helena back . Look , I don 't care about Helena . You have to . She 's your sister . You 're lying . - I 'm your sister , Mark . - You 're lying . ( GUN COCKING ) We did the science , you 're ... You 're my family . You would say anything to get your sister back . Think about it , CASTOR and LEDA , two donors , two originals , siblings ! You are not my family . Now , I need to go find Gracie . SARAH : Mark . Mark ! - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) ( WHIMPERING ) ( PANTING ) ( GUN COCKING ) Mrs Johanssen , please . We shared everything with you , Mark . - Our home , our hearts . - ( MARK GRUNTING ) Our daughter . Now you 'll answer to us . ( STAMMERS ) Please . ( MARK SHUDDERING ) I love her . Not like her mother . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( CROWS CAWING ) You 're the one with the blessed child . - ( GRUNTS ) - Guards ! You 're a shit mother ! - There was a car following me . - Was it Marci Coates ? MAN : My boss wants a meeting . - Whoa , mister , that my wife ! - Shut up . I 'm not gonna let an app decide who I love . Nobody meets anyone in person any more , darling . - I 'm not . No . - Why not ? - ( GASPS SOFTLY ) - There you are , Mommy .

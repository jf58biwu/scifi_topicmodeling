JOSH : Those were UFOs ! That 's what a UFO is ! CAROLINE : You guys , I think that 's our cue to clean up . - We gotta-Right ? Come on . Dad ! - JOSH : Are you kidding me ?

Well , I hope it was our Air Force . JOSH : Grandpa . ( Josh laughing ) That was amazing ! ( theme music playing ) " Phoenix " ( " Twilight Zone " theme plays ) NEWSREADER : When these lights appeared over Phoenix , people immediately thought : UFOs . Outer space . - We were standing about here ? - Right about here . - JOSH : Whoa ! - CAROLINE and SOPHIE : Whoa ! They went just over the valley toward South Mountain like a ... what seemed to be a " V " formation , - It was definitely interesting . - JOSH : Mm-hmm . NEWSREADER : So far , the military hasn 't claimed any testing in the area from nearby Luke Air Force Base , which leaves many residents wondering 'What were those mysterious fights ? " It seemed like the Air Force didn 't know what it was , and if that 's true , then what was it , you know ' ? I don 't know . And now I 'll ask Officer Stein and his colleagues to escort the accused into the room so that we may all look upon the guilty party . Don 't get him too close to me , please . This just goes to show that you guys are entirely too serious . ( loud laughter ) CAROLINE : No one really took ll that seriously from what I remember . Except Josh . SOPHIE : Would you say he was sort of single-minded about stuff , like , once he got an idea ? Yeah . Yeah , there was no stopping him . ( player whirring ) ( " X-Files " theme plays ) ( crows cawing ) JOSH : Peewee . Peewee . Excuse me , sir , do you have a second to talk about the ... - Nope . - Phoenix Lights ? Okay , thank you . - It was just a " V " like this . - JOSH : And you saw that yourself ? It was just a " V " like that , man . And we were like ... And we were like , " Hey , man , check that out , man . " I know ... UFOs will come at us ... and attack one day . - JOSH : You think they 'll attack ? - And if that hap ... And if that happens , we will be prepared . JOSH : So , did you see the lights ? No , not personally . JOSH : Okay , so you saw them on , like , the news ? - Yeah . - JOSH : Awesome . Channel 3 ? No . JOSH : It doesn 't matter . Uh , do you think it was a UFO ? I don 't know . Maybe . - Okay , so , um ... - Can I ask you something now ? - JOSH : Yeah . - ASHLEY : Can I give you some advice ? - JOSH : Umm , sure . Yeah . - ASHLEY : This is an interview , right ? - JOSH : Yeah . - ASHLEY : So maybe you should ask me some open-ended questions . You know , like , things that don 't just warrant yes or no answers . Just , like , get me to talk ... JOSH : Okay , yeah . No . Sure . Is this the same place ? WOMAN : She just had this charm about her that was electric . I think because of that she could get a lot out of people , people trusted her , saw her as a confidant . Jack was kind of pushing the lawyer thing , but truly I ... I think Ashley 's passion was journalism . ASHLEY m w " Good morning , Canyon Park High School . I 'm Ashley Foster , CPTV . Just want to say hello to all the new freshmen in the building . Welcome aboard . I know locker combinations can be tricky , but you 'll make it through just like I did . So just keep trying . Together , we 're a team ... and this is not teamwork . - ( chuckles ) That 's cute . - MELISSA : Yeah . SOPHIE : What did you guys think of Josh ? We didn 't know him . - MELISSA : Is that Josh 's yearbook ? - SOPHIE : Yeah , umm ... Ashley signed it . - MELISSA : Oh really ? - SOPHIEI Yeah . - There it is . - MELISSA : Oh ! Look at that . ( chuckles ) I mean , he was never one of these kids that came over to the house . That 's it . Josh Bishop . - Seems like she had a lot of friends . - Oh , she did , yeah . She was a charmer . Have you ever ... Have you ever heard the story of Ezekiel 's wheel ? JOSH : Umm ... - It-It 's from the Bible . - JOSH : Oh . Yeah . Definitely not . Ezekiel describes God coming down from heaven in a chariot . It 's lighting up the sky , but all along the outside are eyes . JOSH : Why would God need a spaceship ? ( laughing ) Exactly , because he is space . Yeah . - JOSH : All right , we 're done . It 's cool . - It 's done ? - JOSH : Yeah , yeah , yeah . - Great . Okay . Bye . JOSH : Thanks for doing it . CAROLINE : A very sweet girl . I met hera few times . I definitely know that Josh had a crush on her and ... rm hoping ... Now I 'm going to cry , I 'm hoping she liked him . Just ... because they ... spent so much time together , it would have been nice to know that he , in his short life , could experience that . - SOPHIE : That 's Ashley 's handwriting . - CAROLINE : Mm-hmm . SOPHIE : And how much do you know about what Ashley and Josh were working on ? We certainly didn 't know any of that until ... - later . - Later . - It was after . - Yeah . Yeah . - We knew very little . - Mm-hmm . ( player whirring ) We 're going to meet with some astronomers . - JOSH : Okay . - They 're going to have rocks and all different kinds of stuff to show us , so we 've got to be prepared , and we need to make sure that we 're on our " A " game . JOSH : What does our " A " game mean ? We just have to be professional . But I 'm feeling ... I feel like I 've been pretty professional so far , thank you . I don 't think I 'm exactly amateur hour . I know , but I guess I 'm just a little nervous . I want everything to go good . Well , do you have any questions prepared ? I have a ton , they 're in my backpack . Do you have my backpack by the way ? JOSH : Yeah , I do . MAN : Have you ever held a meteorite before ? I 'll start with this one . ASHLEY : Whoa ! ( laughing ) MAN : We get phone calls about UFOs kind of frequently . JOSH : So when the Phoenix Lights happened , were people calling and asking ? Uh ... yeah , they were . - A few . - ASHLEY : He shot the footage . - Oh , you shot the footage ? - ( laughing ) That 's right , yeah . Oh , congratulations ! Can you learn to focus ? - ( both laughing ) - There you go . STEVE ( on TV ) : They 're in a formation of some kind , but they 're not really moving . Okay , that 's more likely flares . ( radio chatter ) DON : The flares are probably fifty to a hundred miles away . So you don 't see the smoke . You just see a bright light that just hangs there because of the parachute to hold them in place . ASHLEY : Would you say you 're a hundred percent sure it 's not or you 're ninety-nine percent sure and still open to the possibility ? No , I 'm a hundred percent sure that-that-that ... that that 's what it was . - Oh ! Ajet . - DON : It 's an F-18 . - JOSH : What was that ? - ASHLEY : What did you say , Don ? - F-18 . - ASHLEY : How do you know ? MARK : He 's got the ear for it . ASHLEY : All right , I got as close as I could . There 's this creepy guy who was just staring me down . I think he was about to call security on me . JOSH : You actually believe it was the Air Force . - You believe that ... - I do not . - You believe the bearded ... - I don 't know what I believe yet ! - I 'm open ... - JOSH : The bearded Galileo Society of Phoenix , Arizona . I 'm disappointed . You 're no longer a producer . ASHLEY : I am absolutely a producer ! ( whispering ) I think I found the section . JOSH : " Ancient UFO sightings . " ASHLEY : Check this out . Petroglyphs . JOSH : That 's totally a spaceship . Isn 't this that Bible thing you were talking about ? ASHLEY : Ezekiel 's wheel . JOSH : Wait , I know what this reminds me of . It 's like the machine at the end of Contact . ASHLEY : I love that movie . Okay to go . ( shuddering ) Okay t0 9 ° - - JOSH : Initiate drop sequence . - Okay to go ! Oh , my God , Oh , my God . I think I 'm going through a wormhole ! ( laughing ) Okay . JOSH : I don 't wani to seem ungrateful for all the help , but what are we doing here ? We should be , like , breaking into Area-51 . ASHLEY : Can you tell us your name and what you do here ? TONY : My name is Tony Duncan , I 'm from the Apache Nation . For the most part , we do a lot of story-telling . A lot of our stories of creation talk about how at one time we were up in the lights , up in the sky world , so maybe it was one of our peoples up there . ASHLEY : So , you saw the lights last week ? I didn 't see them . I didn 't see them ... that exact time , um , but I just heard everyone 's different stories . But then eventually , you know , I seen all the footage of it . I first thought of the star people . " That must be them , our relatives . " ASHLEY : You said you didn 't see them that exact time . - What did you mean ? - Yeah . Actually , um ... way before the lights that were seen in Phoenix , my friend that I grew up with ... His name is Pony ... We actually seen some lights in the same way , but they were a lot closer , and we followed them . - ASHLEY : Wait . - JOSH : You saw the same formation ? Yeah , yeah . They were in the sky , and they were actually ... They 'd be here and then they would take off really fast , and they would move around , and it was really exciting , and then it went way out into the field . Like , we were running way out into the field for a long time , - our legs were getting all scratched up . - ( Ashley laughs ) Eventually , it just took off . Away , high upward . Just ... We couldn 't see it anymore . Uh , but we still talk about that , Pony and I. Uh , but that was off over in Salt River , in the Salt River Reservation . ASHLEY : The bus definitely doesn 't go that far . JOSH : That 's where we 're going . ASHLEY : Well , that 's where we 're deciding if we should go , to be more accurate . JOSH : Are you serious ? What , are you scared of sky people ? Of being taken to the spirit world - with the Anasazi . - Well , I kind of believed him . JOSH : Please come . I need my producer , you know . ( laughs ) JOSH : I think it would make a really sick documentary . I 'll show it to colleges or ... somebody . How do we gel there ? ( laughs ) ( doorbell rings ) JOSH : That 's for me . CAROLINE : Okay . Mark ! - MARK : Mrs. Bishop . - CAROLINE : I haven 't seen you in so long . - I know , how are you ' ? - Good , how are you ? He ? - - You look great . - Thank you . - Did you do something with your hair ' ? - CAROLINE : Oh . Just got it done . - JOSH : Are you serious ? - Thanks for noticing . - No problem . - JOSH : Can you stop flirting with my mom ? I 'm not flirting with your mom . She does look pretty good though . JOSH : All right , go . And let 's not forget our most important piece of equipment on this journey ... ( taps ) my 1994 Grand Jeep Cherokee . Six-cylinder engine , blood-red finish , roof racks ... 16-inch clearance , perfect for maneuvering over any desert ... ( thump ) JOSH : Sorry . NEWSREADER ( on TV ) : phenomenon has returned . - JOSH : Oh , shit . - For the second time in one week , mysterious lights have been spotted over the Phoenix area ... - Yo , Mark ! Look at this ! - This time , over the suburb of Mesa . The sightings fascinated residents . MAN ( on TV ) : ll was completely silent . You couldn 't hear it , hm you knew it was there . It was just massive , it was big . NEWSREADER : Eye-witnesses describe what they saw as being identical to the glowing orbs that passed through the area earlier this week ... Is that them ? Are those your aliens ? A mysterious " V " formation that flew from west to east . - The video you 're seeing right now ... - JOSH : Dude , I know where this is . Captured in Mesa about ten miles from the ... JOSH : Wait , this is it , here on the right . Right , right , right , right ! Go ! - Go , go , go , go , go ! - MARK : Shit . Let me know - a little earlier next time - ( Josh laughs ) MARK : Jeez , man . Dang . ( car doors closing ) JOSH : This is it . This is where they were , right over that ridge . MARK : Well ... whatever they were , they 're long gone now . JOSH : Dude . Well , dude , check this out . Somebody / s up there . You do realize we gotta get up in , like , six hours , right ? JOSH : Dude , we 're almost to the top . MARK : All right . Whoa ! Get down . Dude , kill the light . What are you doing ? Josh ? ( switch clicks ) ( whispering ) Josh , let 's get the hell out of here . JOSH : Just hang on . MARK : Man , those are cops up there . JOSH : Dude , there 's no plates . MARK : I don 't care , let 's go . MARK : They 're just cops . JOSH : Dude , cops don 't walk around in the middle of the night with telescopes . They 're looking for it . MARK : What ? - JOSH : The UFO . - MARK : Josh , I don 't care . Let 's go . - JOSH : That 's what they 're looking for . - MARK : on , my God . - MAN : Hey ! - JOSH : Oh shit ! MARK : Run , bitch ! Run ! Come on ! JOSH : Okay , so this is the first sighting right above South Mountain . This is the second . And this is where we 're going , right in the flight path of the first two . Nobody knows about this . I told you . I guess we 'll find out tomorrow . MAN : This was an unusual case . SOPHIE : What do you mean it was unusual ? In what sense ? Uh , well ... it 's very uncommon to have three kids go missing at the same time . - Just because there were three of them ? - There were three , yeah . It is usually one , maybe two , boyfriend-girlfriend , but the fact that the / e were three , you know , set it outside of the norm . ( chattering ) SOPHIE : What did you guys use to get to drink ? MAN : I always got lemonade but Mark , he 'd always go for a suicide . All the way down . Dash of everything . SOPHIE : Do you remember the night that you got the call ? Sure . Yeah . Um ... I was in my first year at ASU , and X got a ca } ! late at night from my mom saying that Mark hadn 't come home . My dad was convinced that I 'd taken him to some frat party and gotten him drunk . He was pissed off . ( police radio chatter ) He was even more pissed than Ashley 's dad , if you can believe that . My mom told me that if I just got them home ASAP , I wouldn 't get in trouble . They just " they refused to believe me . I didn 't realize at the time that I was the last reasonable explanation that they had before they started to freak out for real . OFFICER ( on radio ) : Officer ... DISPATCHER ( on radio ) : Is someone the / e ? OFFICER : Possible 11-24 on the side of the highway . ( dispatcher speaks indiscernibly ) OFFICER : No , no one inside . - Copy that , 11-24 . - DISPATCHER : 10-4 . ( engine starts ) SOPHIE : Should I put my phone in airplane mode ? PILOT ( over headset ) : It won 't affect the flight at all - if you don 't put it in . - SOPHIE ( over headset ) : All right . - I use that on planes . - PILOT : Yeah , that 's bull crap . SOPHIE : The reason I wanted to talk to you was because you were involved - in the search for my brother . - I was . Um , can you tell me a little bit about ... about that ? Strange case . KEVIN : That 's where the car was found . Right down them ? SOPHIE : Do you think someone could have forced them off the road ? MAN : It 's possible , but I doubt it . It seems like they left the car here intentionally . SOPHIE : What do you mean , " intentionally " ? Oh , the car was parked perfectly in line , so it didn 't seem like they were in a rush or anything . The doors were locked . We didn 't find the keys . It was functional . It ... it ran . It wasn 't like it ran out of gas or the battery died out there . They were able to start it up . WALTER : And we found some beers in the car . SOPHIE : Some beers ' ? Like , they were drinking ? Yeah . Just a couple of beers . We really don 't know if that means anything . There were traces of blood , and we think it was Mark 's . And your brother 's camera , of course . CAROLINE : This is the one they found in the car . MARK : The Diamondbacks are the snakes that you want to look out for . Some dude died . I guess he was climbing over , like , a ridge and it struck , and it hit him in the neck . - ( hon ks ) - JOSH : You dick ! MARK : What ? JOSH : Are you serious ? What about her parents , huh ? MARK : You 're the one who wants to hit the road . JOSH : You want to get in trouble before we even leave ? - God . - Now she comes out . JOSH : Well . I guess it worked . It 's 7 : 30 in the morning , you dicks . MARK : All right , well , there 's a lot of dicks getting thrown at the driver right now . ( Ashley laughs ) What ? 'Ah " YOU guys ready ' ? - Josh , do you have all the equipment ? - Can you move your camera ? JOSH : Yeah , no , we 're good , we 're good . Are you sure we shouldn 't double check ? 'Cause once we 're gone , we 're gone . - Okay , go , go . Please drive . - MARK : What ? - It 's just I don 't want to talk to my dad . - JOSH : He looks like a sweet man . ASHLEY : Yeah , until you meet him . Wait , when do you guys have to be home by ? MARK : My parents aren 't as concerned . My mom just like won 't go to sleep until I 'm home . Different when you 're a girl ... - MARK : No , no , a hundred percent . - With two men . - ASHLEY : Hey look ! Look , Josh . - It would say Interstate . Look at this . It looks like those petroglyphs in that book . - MARK : Those were clearly made ... - ASHLEY : Quick , shoot that . MARK : by alien spacecraft .

Wouldn 't know if it was a couple of hours or maybe a whole day . That 's the hole we 're trying to fill . REPORTER : Another day in the desert , searching for clues for three missing teens . So the ground search was odd , 'cause it turned up almost nothing . Normally in a case like that where people turn up missing and then we find a vehicle , um , they locate something . And there were no effective trails that led us one direction or another and even when they used their dogs out there . REPORTER 3 : After two days of searching , a small army of law officers are setting up camp alongside a desert highway . KEVIN : People that are on the ground tell you that , " Hey , the one gal has a bright yellow shirt or something . " So that 's something that you 're gonna try to key on as looking down . And you just go back and forth , kind of like mowing the yard . It looks very flat from the air , but when you get down on the ground and you start walking around even the smallest bit of terrain , there is a lot of ... lol of places they could be . Now anyone with any information about this case is asked to call a special tip line ... KEVIN : If you 'd have asked me at the front end , " Are we going to find these kids , " I would have said , " Yeah . Oh , yeah , we 'll find them . " Three things to look for . Three shirts . I don 't want to be morbid , but three bodies . I mean , there 's-there 's more ... There 's more to search for . We just found nothing . SOPHIE : So if you were to speculate , what do you think happened to them ? Maybe if I wasn 't on camera or something , I-I-I think maybe I could give you some opinions , but , um , it 's hard to speculate . SOPHIE : Okay , so what do you think happened ? ( laughing ) KEVIN : There 's potentially some sort of relationship issue . One boy likes the girl , and the girl likes the other boy , and the two boys find out about the issue . PIROUZNIA : Maybe somebody came along and picked them up and could have taken them somewhere , but they should have surfaced . WALTER : Foul play is possible , but it 's very tough if only one person did it . It 's very difficult to hold three people , you know , together . KEVIN : It could just be someone out there that 's running some dope . SOPHIE : They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time . KEVIN : Wrong place wrong time . Stumble upon something that was five miles from where they were , where the vehicle was located , and they were driven to that koca ... Like I said , we didn 't find anything , so who knows what happened ? Hard to speculate . ASHLEY : How did you meet Josh ? MARK : I feel weird talking about this , 'cause I know he 's gonna watch it later . We met , uh ... We met in church actually . - ASHLEY : Really ? - MARK : Yeah . Everybody called Josh , " Ginger , " and they were making fun of him , like , calling him " Ginger " because of his red hair , but when I was little , I didn 't know " Ginger " was a name for redheads . I just thought it was a nickname , like , specifically for Josh . So I just thought the coolest kid a1 Sunday school ... everybody knew who he was , so I went out of my way to hang out with him . - ( Ashley chuckles ) - That 's when we started becoming friends . ASHLEY : Oh , nice . ASHLEY : I just got some B-roll , but I got some really cool cactuses ... JOSH : Were you guys filming me while I was asleep ? - ASHLEY : No . - MARK : No . Never . - ( Josh laughs sarcastically ) - ASHLEY : Okay , a little bit . - MARK : Can you put your seatbelt back on ? - ASHLEY : Yeah . - MARK : Yeah . - ASHLEY : Literally nothing out here . ( shouts ) Hello ! MARK : You 're gonna get your head taken off by one of those . - I wanna live here . - MARK : You wanna live here ? Yeah . Maybe . - Wh0a , whoa , watch out ! - ( thuds ) - JOSH : God ! - MARK ( chuckles ) : Sorry , guys . My bad . - Whoa , check that out . - JOSH : What ? What is it ? MARK : Dead animal . A coyote ? - JOSH : Is it two ? - MARK : Yeah . - Yeah , it is . - JOSH : Hold on , this camera sucks . ( static ) - SOPHIEI So that 's it ? - CAROLINE : That 's it . That 's the last he shot . SOPHIE : Hang on . So Josh went all the way out there and then just didn 't shoot anything past the road ? Doesn 't that seem weird to you ? WALTER : I always thought it was a little odd . SOPHIE : Why ? Why odd ? Well , your brother ... He seemed to have that camera glued to his face all the time . It-It just didn 't make any sense to leave it behind . SOPHIE : So do you think maybe they had a second camera ? Like , is that a possibility ? I thought about that . Still think your brother would have had that with him . PIROUZNIA : I know Ashley had access to those camera equipment and could check out , but I don 't remember anything being unaccounted for at the time . We ... we ran that thread out as far as we could , and we just couldn 't take it , and law enforcement couldn 't take it anywhere either . SOPHIE : So that 's what the kids would have been using back in ' 97 , right ? It 's a little before my time , but yeah , probably . SOPHIE : Do you still have any of those old cameras laying around ? Yeah . ASHLEY { on W } : I 'm Ashley Foster , CPTV . Just want to say hello to all the new freshmen in the building . LUISA : Where did you get this ? SOPHIE : This was found in Mark Abrams ' Jeep after he went missing with Ashley and with my brother . We think Josh had a second camera with him on the trip . If he did have one , it most likely came from the school , so I was wondering if you thought Ashley could have checked one out from here , like , maybe she used a different name ? It 's possible , but like I said , it was before I started . Would there have been , like , a logbook or records of that ? - Like , stuff that might have been ... - It 's been 20 years . I 'm so sorry I can 't be of more help to you . Even if they had a second camera , it just ... it went missing with them . Just another dead end , you know ? REPORTER ( on TV ) : And new developments tonight . Rescuers were forced to call off their search for three missing teens , saying there was " no new credible evidence or clues to guide the search . " It 's like they 've been written off . They 've been ... my son and his friends have been abandoned by the police department . PIROUZNIA : All the efforts bylaw enforcement to develop some evidence as to what happened , they were pretty ... Well , they were negative . They could never go anywhere with the case . I think if they had kids , they 'd want somebody looking for their kid . ( camera clicks ) Dear Ashley , I know that you 're alive ... and that you can hear my voice right now . You can 't imagine how much your father and I miss you ... and love you . Every night , I have a dream that ! come downstairs and you 're sitting at the table We you were never even gone . I know this means something . I know it means that you ... are still alive . ( emotionally ) Your father and I will never give up hope . I love you , Ashley . Please come home . MELISSA : I wanted a funeral ... but Jack wouldn 't have it . So , here we are . The bench was a compromise ? Yep . That 's what marriage is about . It 's ... uh ... Sophie , I don 't ... I don 't think your brother 's alive . I don 't think ... I don 't think he is . I think something would have developed . SOPHIE : Jay , get in here . - JAY : What 's up ? - Have you seen this ? If you 'd been here ten years ago and standing out here and looking up there a ! the tights and the view , um , you would have been astounded . You would have been amazed . - JAY : Is that the governor ' ? - Yeah . Twenty years ago , he said the lights were a joke . He had a whole press conference making fun of them . And now he 's saying he saw the lights that night . MAN ( on laptop ) : I got four of ' em . He 's basically admitting he lied . REPORTER " . The former governor , a Vietnam Air Force veteran , had never publicly acknowledged seeing it until now And I suspect that ... unless the Defense Department proves this otherwise , that it was probably some form of an alien spacecraft . And I think as a public figure , you have to be very careful about what you say , because people can have pretty emotional reactions . JAY : Is that him ? Okay , follow me and just keep rolling . Excuse me , Mr. Garland ? Hi , I 'm Sophie Bishop . We spoke on the phone . I 'm sorry , I can 't help you . Right , I just have a couple questions . You worked for the governor from 1992 until he resigned in ' 97 , is that right ? Sophie , I don 't know anything about your brother . Okay , what about the Phoenix Lights ? On March 15th , 1997 , you went on TV , and you said that they were military flares . Did you see the Governor on CNN saying that was a lie ? You were his press secretary at the time . Listen , I really am very sorry about your brother . We were just trying not to create a panic . Who told you to lie ? I mean , what if Josh was on to something ? We always assumed he got lost or kidnapped or ... murdered but what if ... JAY : What if he got abducted by aliens ? ( chuckles ) Jesus , I sound like him , don 't I ? JAY : So ... now what ? I don 't know . I don 't know what we 're doing here anymore . CAROLINE : Can ? believe you 're leaving . It feels like you just got here . SOPHIE : Can I ask you one more question ? Why did you and Dad decide to call it quits ? Sweetheart , everyone 's divorced now . I want to know . Was it Josh 's disappearance or would you guys have split up anyway ? - ASHLEY ( on TV ) : Hello ! - ( Mark chuckles ) MARK : You 're going to get your head taken off by one of those . ASHLEY : I want to live here . - MARK : You want to live here ? - ASHLEY : Yeah . Maybe . Josh , you want to stop here ? - STEVE : Well , how is she ' ? - SOPHIE : She 's good . Just getting ready for the big move , you know . Well , please tell her , you know , if she needs any help or anything , she should call me . Somebody knows what happened . JAY : Mark didn 't just wander off into the desen ' . He didn 't get lost . That never made sense to me . SOPHIE : If Josh hadn 't gone missing ... do you think you and Mom would still be together ? Yeah . Whafd she say ' ? Sweetheart , what happened was your brother went missing . Completely missing . And it took over our lives . REPORTER : Resources to make sure these teenagers are found . If that 's true , then what was it , you know ? I don 't know . CAROLINE : Is Josh dead ? Is he alive ? Was he suffering ? Our relationship became about all those questions , and your father , he couldn 't do it anymore and still be the man that I fell in love with , and I couldn 't do it anymore and still be his wife . ( jets pass closely overhead ) STEVE : Everybody keeps criticizing me for , you know , not dealing with it . I was the only one who was still out there trying to figure out what happened to your brother . SOPHIE : Do you think there 's ever going to be a point where you can let it go , Dad ? I mean , show ... show me his body . - Good to see you . - SOPHIE : Love you . - I love you , too . - Okay . All right . Do me a favor : When you get home , give me a call , okay ? - Okay . - Let me know you got in okay . - Yeah . - Okay . - We 're going to see you Christmas ? - Yeah , I 'll see you Christmas . - Okay . - Qkay . - All right . - SOPHIE : Love you .

SOPHIE : Hi . - Thank you so much for meeting me . - Yeah . Did you have a hard time finding the place ? - No , no , not at all . - Great . This place has been on the books since the late ' 70s . Pretty much anything old or outdated gets thrown in here . I was throwing away some garbage over the weekend and just saw it sitting in the drawer . Somebody must have thrown it in here and forgotten about it . - Can I take this ? - Oh , it 's yours . DAN : I know you 're excited about this , but ... I just don 't want you to get your hopes up , you know ? SOPHIE : Yeah , I know . Is that a tape ' ? - Be careful . - JAY : I know . Okay . - SOPHIE : That 's Ashley 's handwriting . - JAY : Really ?

Hi there . So we can do the interview out here or in your office , whichever you prefer . It 's not gonna happen . ( speaks indiscernibly ) Okay , but ... when we spoke on the phone , you said that it was fine , so I guess I 'm just wondering what happened that made you change your mind . I understand . ( speaks indiscernibly ) { helicopter approaching ) Did you watch the footage ? ( helicopter passes overhead ) ( speaks indiscernibly ) Drive safe . JAY : You okay ? Yeah , I just honestly wasn 't expecting that . JAY : What did he say ? He said , " Don 't let that footage get out . " ( scoffs ) JAY : What do you want to do ? What do you think Josh would do ' ?

Come look at this . - JOSH : What do you got ' ? - ASHLEY : Whoa . Petroglyphs . JOSH : Oh ! ASHLEY : Guess this means we 're on the right track . MARK : Wow . Ancient graffiti . Now what you see below me are Native American petroglyphs . They were probably put here hundreds of years ago by the Apache . They were native to these lands , very adept at living in these mountainous regions . Uh ... the spiral shape that you see below us ... Historians aren 't quite sure what it could have represented . It could have represented ripples in water , things that they saw in the sky . And ... that 's pretty much it . Petroglyphs . ASHLEY : Please be careful . ( Yelps ) ( laughs ) - You get that ? - JOSH : Yeah . - It look steep ? - Yeah . ASHLEY : You guys are idiots . ASHLEY : Ah , I should not have smoked that cigarette . ( imitating gunfire ) ASHLEY : Whoa . How far do you want us to go , Josh ? JOSH : Just keep going . ASHLEY : I 'm wheezing . I 'm out of breath . Whoa . - You rolling ? - JOSH : Yeah .

We gotta go . ASHLEY : All right , we 're leaving . JOSH : What if we get arrested by , like , the Air Force or something ? MARK : That would actually be the scariest situation . JOSH : Like our parents don 't ever find out , like , what 's going to happen to us . The Air Force just takes us away or something . MARK : That 'd be so sad . JOSH : My mom would think I was just in my room playing with the camera . MARK : They wouldn 't notice ? They wouldn 't ... like , it would take a couple years I think .

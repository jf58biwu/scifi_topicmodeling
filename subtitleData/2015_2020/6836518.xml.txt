 Previously on Travelers ... Can he be saved ? If we can stabilize him , replace or rebuild one or more of his organs ... 7325 . What ? Why don 't you come by for third period and I 'll help you study ? - I 'll be there . - Good . I 'm sorry because you 've had to deal with this all alone . I 've had help . David . He cares for me . I thought he kicked you out . It 's not like that . What were you going to say ? Tell me . I 'm dying . Hi . Hello . Are you just watching me sleep ? Well , you know , just ... Patiently waiting for you to wake up . So ... we could do this ? What 's wrong ? I 'm fine . It 'll pass . Marcy , you 're bleeding . Aah ! Hi . It 's Grace Day calling to confirm my appointment for 11 : 45 ? Great . I 'll see you then . Thanks . Tre ... David ... I 'm scared . It 's okay . I 've got you . You 're going to be fine . No . Marce ... No . Come on , now . Marce ! Aah ! A-ha ! Coffee ? Well ... it 's the least I could do . The least you could do is nothing , and then leave without telling me , which is what you usually do . I 'm ... gonna get better . Are you ? Here . Try it . Is it good ? It 's coffee . Sorry . Just ... Don 't let me stop you . MacLaren . David ? Yeah . Of course I remember you . What ? Okay , I 'll be right there . I-I 'm ... I 'm sorry . You have your priorities . And you are one of them . No ! Please stay calm . Ms. Day , I can explain . What the hell are you doing ? I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm trying to help you . Please , just relax . Help me ! Help ! Please , stop yelling . Stop . There 's nobody for miles . This is all happening for a reason . You drugged and dragged me into the woods ? I sedated you , yes , but only because I had to get you out here . Off the grid . Away from all technology . This was the only way I could be sure . Sure of what ? What are you going to do to me ? In the historical record , Grace Day dies at 11 : 27 a.m. on the corner of Westlake and Harmon Avenue . That 's by my dentist . H-How would I ... I scouted the location . It was impossible to determine what would kill you , and if I had intervened , the traffic cams would 've allowed The Director to take you . The Director ? I know how it sounds , but I 'm not a crazy person . Do you know this Director ? The Director sent me here . To do what ? Perform missions . Like this ? No . No , I 'm breaking protocol by doing this . Our mission is to save the world , Ms. Day . I 'm from the future . Agent MacLaren . David . Thanks for calling . Yeah . You mind giving us a moment ? Yeah . No , of course . I 'll-I 'll just ... Thanks . What happened ? I 'm sorry . I told him a thousand times not to ... not to take me to the hospital . No , that 's okay . It 's fine . This is exactly where you should be . Have they told you what 's wrong ? I mean , do you want to check your charts ? I know what 's wrong . There 's too much pre-existing damage . I don 't understand . My host 's brain was congenitally underdeveloped . I came up with a treatment that I thought was working . I 'm sorry that I didn 't ... It 's all right . We 're gonna fix this . I don 't think that it 's ... possible . You just helped to practically bring me back from the dead . Anything 's possible . Hello ? Carly , hi . I wasn 't sure I 'd be able to reach you . I 've been off the grid for a day or so . I 'm sorry . Are you in any danger ? It 's okay , you can tell me . No , I 'm fine . Why ? What is it ? Well , to be honest , I was ... hoping you might have reasons beyond your control for why you abandoned your son at his father 's . Abandoned ? He 's the father . I 'm well aware , but as he tells it , you asked him to watch Jeffrey for a couple of hours , and haven 't returned since . That was two days ago . I 'm ... I 'm heading there right now . Your actions indicate that you trust him as a caregiver , so I have acted accordingly and filed a recommendation for his father to take custody until the hearing is settled . Jacqueline , please ! Have a good day , Ms. Shannon . Wait ! Traveler 3468 , please greet arriving Traveler 0014 today . Where 's my mom ? Excuse me . This boy 's looking for his mom . It 's a calculation , really . The Director studies the historical record and then assesses which actions to take ... Some big , some not so big ... That will best mitigate the conditions we left behind . And how 's it going ? That 's hard to say . See , a while ago , we deflected an asteroid that would 've caused a huge disaster 18 months from now . Well , that 's very big . That 's what we thought ! We expected that it was gonna impact the future so much so that we might even cease to exist , but nothing 's changed ! So if ... if something doesn 't work out the way you want it to , why don 't you just go back and try again ? That 's an excellent question . We tried that , of course . But for some pretty complicated reasons having to do with ripples in space time , we can only go as far back as the arrival point of the most recent Traveler . There 's no do-overs . Anyway , now you know why I 've missed so much school . I appreciate your honesty , Trevor . I know you don 't believe me . And that 's okay . Neither would I. I still wanted to tell you I was doing this to preserve your life , because you 're a good person , and The Director will just have to find another candidate . Philip ? Over here . Anything show up ? No . Nothing yet . We 've only got two potential hosts for today . First one gets hit by a truck here in about an hour , and the second one dies streetside just before that . These are the locations . Okay . You take that one , and I 'll take the other . Sorry , but what is our mission exactly ? To greet Traveler 0014 . 0014 ? That 's a low number . No kidding . Why is The Director sending back someone so important ? I 'm hoping it 's to help Marcy ! Hi . Here you go . Gotta make sure we keep fluids in you . Yeah , that apple juice is really going to make all the difference . Sorry , I just ... I know you 're trying to help . That 's okay . Nobody likes hospitals . Hey ! That 's not a very nice thing to say . How are you feeling ? I 'm okay . Just tired . Can I ... Can I ... Can I go yet ? Afraid not . We still have a number of tests we 'd like to run , and unfortunately , your MRI didn 't turn out . What do you mean ? Well , it 's just that if the scan was accurate , you 'd barely even be able to communicate with me right now . But it 's no big deal , we just need to do it again , and I 'll put a rush on this one for you . Don 't worry . Everything else appears stable , so I will let you know as soon as we get you slotted in , okay ? Thank you , Doctor . All right . Look out ! Damn it , Morrison , you were on that ! This is the list of potential host candidates ? Not all of them , obviously , but yeah . Then all these people are gonna die ? Yeah . Why ? What 's wrong ? I know this person . Shit . It wasn 't my fault ! Trevor ? Trevor , where are you ? Trevor , what the hell have you done ? There . That should do it . We 've passed your time of death . Do you feel fine ? Other than the obvious discomfort . Good . Then it wasn 't anything medical . Okay ... What is that ? I 'm gonna take you back now . You can claim a sick day and stay home . That doesn 't answer my question . See , this is gonna erase the last 24 hours from your memory . But to you , it 'll just be like you overslept and none of this ever happened . And if I refuse ? I 'm afraid this is part of the deal for saving your life . Not to mention , I 've told you a whole lot of things no one can ever know . Okay , so what happens next ? You knock me out and you drag me back out through the woods ? You ... You 've been favoring your side like it hurts . Stitches . I had some surgery the other day . Organ donor . Well ... ! Why don 't I just walk back out with you ? You know , you don 't want to tear those stitches , and it couldn 't have been easy carrying me all the way out here . Okay . But I have to keep your hands tied . I understand . Yeah . Boss , you there ? Yeah . Nothing 's happened at my TELL yet . Any luck with yours ? No , nothing . I guess that 's one less candidate . No , I mean nothing happened . A crane dropped its load on the sidewalk . No one died . No Traveler arrived . You sure you had the time right ? It 's possible the historical record is off . Some of my bets didn 't turn out , a few race results I 'd memorized changed . What ? Why didn 't you tell me ? It was just a few races . Boss , to be honest , I don 't think that 's it . I think Trevor might have intervened . What makes you think that ? Back when I wrote all those tells on the front door of Ops , he said he knew one of them . Grace Day . No . No . Trevor wouldn 't break protocol . Shit . Okay . You look for Trevor . I 'll work on a backup plan for Marcy . We need to talk . Carly ! What a ... a pleasant surprise . Don 't . Don 't ? Don 't what ? Don 't do what you 're doing . Playing these games . It won 't work . You 're not gonna get Jeffrey from me . I don 't have to take him from you when you straight up hand him over . Look , you are manipulating the wrong person ! Jeffrey is my blood ! My son ! And I could not be more serious when I tell you ... You 're trash . You watch your mouth . Or what ? You know you don 't deserve to be a father . You 're a mess . You know , when you 're close to me like this , I can really smell what a failure you are . I see what you 're doing . When will you learn that I am not an idiot ? You come to my work like this again , and I 'll file a restraining order . David ? Can you get me some more juice ? Yeah , no problem . Thanks . Just push that if anything happens while I 'm gone . Guys ... get me out of here . They want ... to run more tests , and if my MRI comes back with the same results , they 'll be doing experiments on me till I die . Philip , hack their database and get my file , okay ? You got it . Sit tight , Marcy . Hi . I was called in to speak with an Agent Forbes ? Forbes is my partner . I 'll take it from here . Thanks , man . Come on in , Officer ... Boyd . Boyd . You really need to stop making a habit of this . Protocol 6 . This is an emergency . Our medic 's in the hospital , and her condition might be beyond 21st-century medicine . The Director will send help if the intention is to save her . Well , help hasn 't arrived , and she 's getting worse . And you 're coming to me why ? I just want access to your team 's medic . No . Could you at least ask your medic , let them decide for themselves ? I just did . I 'm the medic . And team leader ? Yeah . We lost ours along the way . Someone had to step up . Well , then you , of all people , should understand . We 're just trying to do everything in our power not to lose one of our own . Just have a look at her . That 's all I ask . Hello ? David . I need your help . We got to get Marcy out of the hospital . Is that a good idea ? I wouldn 't be asking if this wasn 't serious . Well , she 's got doctors and nurses coming in every five minutes . I have a way around that . Okay , look , I wanna help , but you said so yourself ... This is exactly where she needs to be . Well , the situation has changed . If the doctors continue to test Marcy , her cover will be blown . I don 't care about her cover . This is important work , David . She told me she was dying . And I have no intention of letting that happen . I have a plan , but the only way I can pull it off is with your help . What do you need me to do ? I need you to be in her room at exactly 1 : 07 sharp . Can you manage that ? Yeah , of course , then what ? Stand by . So why haven 't you gone back and stopped Hitler and Stalin ? I love the way your mind works , but actually we 're only able to come back to the modern age of computers because we need the precise time and location of the host 's death . Close doesn 't work . Then you 're not really Trevor ? No . You remember my concussion ? Well , my consciousness arrived and supplanted his just before the last punch would have killed him . Instead , I conceded the fight , and here we are . - Here we are . - Yeah . Whoa ! Whoa ! Grace ! Grace , are you okay ? Grace ? Grace ! Grace ! Okay . God . All right . Okay . Grace ! Grace ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Grace ! Grace ! Grace ! Hey , hey ! Hey-hey ! Stop ! Grace ! Grace ! 0115 , are you out of your mind ? You do not get to change history on your own ! B-But I-I saved her . How could you possibly ... ? She made a phone call . GPS , voice recognition . Great , I 'm bleeding . Been here less than a minute , and already my body 's damaged . Well ? Knock-knock , Marcy . It 's time for you to head into your MR ... I am so sorry . You murdered her . Get over yourself . Historically , Grace Day died today . Don 't get mad at me because you got caught trying to play God . Candidates shouldn 't be taken after their TELL has passed . It happened . It 's forever . So get over it . Are you here to deliver the repercussions ? No , I didn 't jump here to spank you . I have a mission to complete . If I can get this goddamn car started . Now what ? Home lumbar puncture is pretty unorthodox , but looks like it helped relieve some intracranial pressure . What the hell did you do with the CSF ? She made a serum to help stabilize the neurotransmitter levels . Smart . Kept you alive for this long . But you know it could only buy you so much time . I know . Of course you do . You 've known the whole time , and it must have been brutal . Okay , I can give you a neurotransmitter stimulant I developed for a mission that should help you short-term , but ... Thank you for the second opinion . I wish it was a better one . That should start working right away . You okay ? Thank you . How long does she have ? Not long . The shot I gave her should help her feel more or less normal for a little while , but her neurons are still going like fireworks . But hey , if The Director wants her saved ... Yeah . Thanks . You 're welcome . Check in with your team . Why ? Because I 'm also on a mission to locate 0014 , and by now , they should have his coordinates . They were sent a messenger this morning , so check in and use this so I can hear both of you . Trevor , where the hell have you been ? I 'm sorry . I felt like I had to do it . You broke protocol ! But the new Traveler showed up anyway . Yeah , we 'll talk about that later . Is she 0014 ? For God 's sake ! They haven 't located him yet ? If he didn 't arrive after the messenger , check the tells from before . Why would The Director order us to greet someone who had already arrived ? Who am I talking to now ? Call me Grace . We share the same mission , Agent MacLaren , and it involves Marcy . There 's one potential TELL from earlier today . A farm outside of town . Is that it ? Obviously . Send us the coordinates and meet us there with your whole team . Here . Philip , follow when you can . Carly ? You 're with me . Come on , 014 . Open the damn door . It 's safe ! My name is Ellis ! Get off my property ! I 'm not going to hurt you . What about the kid ? He 's nobody ! Come on . We don 't have much time . Why should I trust you ? 'Cause without me , you 'd still be writing shitty script prompts in a leaky dome like the grumpy no-imagination old bastard you are . 027 . I 'd recognize that tone in any century . Call me Grace . You here to hide too ? Partly . Your defenses are up ? With you ? Always . Got ' em up just after feeding the pigs . I got pigs ! Okay . I want your code . What makes you think I 'm gonna give it to you ? And you are ? Trevor . You look like somebody shot your puppy , Trevor . Do I ? She 's not a real people person , but her heart 's in the right place . You 'll see . Come on in . So ... how 'd you find me ? My team did . They 'll be here soon . Your reinforcements . 014 needs protection . He wrote a backdoor hack that a faction in the future is desperate to get their hands on . What faction ? A group is trying to topple The Director , and they want to use my code to do it . I came here to hide it , so it 's useless . Not useless . How 's it gonna help you in the 21st ? I 'm trying to save somebody 's life . Is that so hard to believe ? Yes . Definitely ! I made a mistake that needs to be corrected . Hacker with a heart of gold . You 're programmers . So how 's my code going to save a life ? You 'll see . And don 't worry . I 'll destroy it as soon as I 'm done . What ... You need it now ? I was just gonna start on supper . He can do that . Do you know how to prepare food ? Yeah , sure . Well , hurry up . I haven 't eaten in centuries . You 've reached Special Agent Grant MacLaren . Please leave a message . Agent MacLaren , it 's David Mailer . I really stuck my neck out back at the hospital , and I 'll probably run into some of these people again , and now I 'm just waiting on a Marcy update , so I 'm not going to lie to you ... Feel a little pissed off . Which isn 't to say that I 'm unwilling to help , obviously I am , but there 's a difference between helping someone and being used by someone . So ... call me back . Trevor ? Trevor ? Who is it ? 3468 . I received a message to greet Traveler 0014 . Well , then ... Greetings ! And you ! Greetings ! So what 's the mission ? You tell me . We just told you . Our mission was to greet you . Then mission accomplished . You folks hungry ? Your friend 's cooking supper , though I think he was expecting a couple more . Yeah , they 're ... on the way . Finally . Where is she ? You must be Grace . What 's going on ? There 's a plan you need to be aware of . These two are programmers . They want to try an experimental procedure on you . What sort of procedure ? They say it could correct your condition . Table isn 't gonna set itself , folks . Grace wants to talk to you . Over here , Marcy . My team said you think you can help me ? Well , Marcy , nice to meet you . Just give me one second here . I 'm almost done . There we go . Sit . How conversant are you with the theory of quantum entanglement ? Um ... I know it 's the basis of how we transfer consciousness . And in order for that to happen , an alignment has to occur . Unforgiving precision . A misfire will kill the incoming consciousness . We need to be 100 % locked in . That 's great , Marcy . Thanks . What was that ? Just a ... calibration test of sorts . Now , let 's eat ! Not only was I part of the programming group , I was the team lead on the social media research . You found the host candidates ? Yes . The early successes made us overconfident in our analysis , so when we came to Marcy 's host ... What 's this one again ? Carrot . " Carrot . " This is spaghetti squash . My host has a refrigerator full of something called " bacon . " When I realized what it was , I cried for a good five minutes . You would . Where was I ? You were saying how you got Marcy 's life wrong . Right . Well , I can 't tell you how much I regret that , Marcy . People make mistakes . I understand . But you don 't understand how I intend to fix it . No . I don 't . By repackaging your original upload in order to bypass the damaged areas in your host brain . It really is brilliant . How does this process not lose information ? It does . Of course it does . I had to prioritize . A few memories , some life experiences will be lost , but the human mind is full of useless things . You won 't even be able to tell the difference . What about all my memories of the 21st ? Well , obviously none of that . I didn 't have access to it , did I ? Just think about this as a reboot of the original . A reboot ? What will happen to her current consciousness ? Same thing that always happens . It 'll get overwritten . You mean she 'll die . It will be her . By any reasonable definition , she will be Marcy . Just not ... this one . I should have told you . Would it have made a difference ? No . Was it ever a threat to the mission ? I don 't think so . Privacy might not exist where we come from , but it does in the 21st , so ... Thank you . And really , what kind of an asshole would I be if I started yelling at you now ? We 'll brief you after the transition , in detail . Philip will remember everything . No . Not everything . I 'm not the same person today as when I arrived . Doesn 't matter how long ago it was . It might as well have been centuries . In a way , it was . You can tell her ... events and missions , and everything you can think of in the most minute detail , but ... you can 't tell her ... What ? Doesn 't matter . Why do you say " her ? " Because she won 't be me . She won 't remember ... the most important part of who I am now . I 'm not gonna sit here and pretend to know what makes us who we are ... But I gotta figure it 's more than just the sum of what we remember . Yeah , you 're right . And I won 't lie to you . You 're important to us , and I don 't want to lose you . I 'm really just one person on one team . That happens to be here to save the world . So there 's that . I 'm not gonna tell you what to do . There she is . What if I don 't go through with it ? What ? What if I refuse the procedure ? Why wouldn 't you go through with it ? You 'll die horribly . Don 't I have the right to die on my own terms ? No . Do you have any idea the trouble I 've gone through ? And I am grateful for that . I 'm humbled by it , but I 'm asking the question ... Is it an option ? No . I think it is . You have a responsibility to the grand plan . You 've taken an oath . Can I just ... have the time to go home and think about it ? Home ... It 's important to me that I see someone before I make this decision . Fine . Thank you . Come on . We 'll take you . Well ... that didn 't go as planned . Are you sure we 're safe here ? I 've taken measures . Well , will they be enough ? I also got a shotgun . Thanks for coming in . I just didn 't really want to be alone right now . Of course . David will be home soon , so I 'll just go make some tea while we wait . I 'll give you a hand . I 'm going to give her a hand too . What the hell did she say to you to make you consider not having a medic on our team ? She didn 't have to . I know what she 's going through . Do you ? What happened to " the mission " comes first ? " She just needs a little time . I 'm sure she 'll make the right decision . You shouldn 't have given her the choice . It 's a little more complicated than that , Carly . Look around . She has a life in the 21st . We all do . Some of us have made sacrifices in order to do what we came here to do . This isn 't about any one person 's happiness . Tell me . What is it about ? I have a unique perspective on this . In the early days of testing the technology , my much younger consciousness was transferred out of my body and back again . That 's not really the same thing . You still had your memories . It was ages ago . Who can remember ? My point is , I was still me when I returned . I didn 't feel any different . Neither will she . " She ? " You 'll be the same person , Marcy . So everyone keeps saying . My perspective is entirely selfish . I just don 't want to lose you . All I know is ... I just need to talk to David first . I didn 't realize you had someone that important to you in your life . Neither did I. Obviously I can 't tell him what I have to choose , but I think ... just ... sitting down and h ... Marcy ? Marcy ! No ! Marcy ! Stand down . We 're your team . This isn 't where I 'm supposed to be . We know . You 're safe . What 's going on ? This isn 't your original TELL . Traveler 3569 ... Welcome to the 21st . Marcy ? Agent MacLaren ? Hey , David . What 's happening ? Thank God . I thought something terrible had happened to you . You must be David . I 'm told we 're ... close .

 Previously on " the 100 " ... Lexa : Blood has answered blood . The body will be given to the people of tondc . Only then can we have peace . Clarke : When it 's over , we talk about how To get our people out of mount weather . We want the same things , clarke . Peace with the grounders is the only way we 'll survive . They 're being led by a child . So are we . We need their army to get to mount weather , bellamy . What we need is an inside man , Someone to be our eyes and ears . I found something . That leads to an antenna on the ground . If we can access the radio , we can send a message Over the arkwide channel , tell them we 're here . Listen to this . Jasper , on radio : 47 of us are trapped inside mount weather . Please hurry . You were right . Without someone on the inside To lower their defenses , turn off the acid fog , An army is useless . You should go . I can get you through the tunnels . Ok . So we make it to the intake door Without any of the real reapers seeing us . What happens then ? I kill everyone , and you slip inside . Limestone . Let 's go . We have a lot of ground to cover before dark . Bellamy : I needed to know what happened after the intake door . They remove your clothes , Blast you with boiling water , And douse you with something That burns even worse . From there , we were sorted . The others were tagged harvest . I was tagged cerberus , turned into a reaper . Cerberus , 3-headed dog That guards the underworld . My mom read mythology to us all the time . Octavia loved it . You 're good for her . You made her strong . She was already strong . Hey , i need to ask you something . You protected my sister before you even knew her . Why ? When i was a boy , I saw a ship fall from the sky Like raven 's . The man inside was hurt , his body broken . I couldn 't get him out . Suicide by earth . I heard the stories in the guard . I just didn 't know they were true . I brought him food , water . I didn 't speak the enemy 's language yet . So i couldn 't understand him , but i wanted to . So on the third day , i told my father . He made me kill him . The world has been trying to turn me Into a monster for as long as i can remember . Let 's keep moving . Wait . Parking garage where we found you , It 's north , that way . There 's a mine entrance Closer to where the reapers hand us over . We 'll go into the underworld when we have to , not before . Open the gate ! Thought we 'd start with a reception , Then move on to training . We have a lot to learn from each other . Weapons there , please . Only our guards are armed here . Thank you for agreeing to this , indra . We 're here on the commander 's orders . I agreed to nothing . Please . We 'll begin in a moment . Well , it 's a start . It 's a mistake . I convinced abby to release you . Don 't make me regret that . Let me tell you how this ends , marcus . Either we lose and mount weather kills us all Or we win our new friends do . I thought you had faith . This is their land , and believing That they 'll let us live here happily ever after Isn 't faith . It 's stupidity . You 're wrong . It 's common sense . There 's enough here for everyone . We just need to make them see That it 's in their interest to share , And that starts today . [ indistinct conversations ] Kane : All right . Quiet down . Indra , please . Don 't worry . My shock baton has got your back . How about you stick it up your ass instead ? I know we don 't have a lot in common , But we do have a common enemy and a common goal . For us to reach it , To get our people out of mount weather , We need to work together ... Kane : Our survival depends on us sharing your knowledge ... Do you got a problem ? I 'm sorry , man . I don 't speak grounder . Mr. Murphy , apologize to that man . For what ? He was the one who came at me . Two days work detail . Work detail ? I just told you , i didn 't do- - Care to make it 3 ? You 're gonna burn just like your friend . Murphy ! Murphy , back off ! Murphy , stop ! Knock it off . Stop ! Stop . People , stop ! Quint : This argument is a waste of time . It is simple . They can 't breathe our air . Why not just open the door and be done with it ? Let them burn . Burn them . Burn them ! No , because they have a containment system , Multiple airlocks just like we had on the ark . Our inside man can shut that down . If he gets inside . What if we shut it down from the outside ? You say the dam gives them power . Let 's take that away . That dam withstood a nuclear war , commander . I highly doubt- - [ slam ] All she offers is no . Quint ... Apologies , commander , but the biggest army We 've ever had waits for us to give it a mission . The longer that takes , the more of our people Die inside that mountain . It 's the same for all of us . We 've lost thousands . How many have you lost , girl ? She says she has a plan . I say waiting for one man to get inside Is not a very good one . I agree with quint . We have an army . Let 's use it . We will after bellamy lowers their defenses , Turns off the acid fog . I don 't care how many men you have . If you can 't get to your enemy , you can 't win . You are the enemy . I 'm sorry . Have i done something to offend you ? Quint : Yes . You burned my brother alive in a ring of fire . He shouldn 't have attacked my ship . You 're very brave under the commander 's Protection , aren 't you ? Quint is right . Waiting for bellamy is not a plan . It 's a prayer , One that 's not likely to be answered . Excuse me . I need some air . The mountain has many eyes Between here and the tunnels . From now on , details must be exact . What if we run into real reapers ? Won 't they wonder where you 've been ? All they see is the red . Once you take it , nothing else matters , Just how you 'll get more . How much do you remember from when you were on it ? Everything . Turn around . [ exhales ] Not so brave , are you now , sky girl ? [ arrow releases ] Ahh ! Uh ! Uh ! Impressive , aren 't they ? What doesn 't kill them Makes them stronger . Yaagh ! I am . We 're supposed to train together , right ? Only warriors train here . I saved your life . And now i 'm saving yours . [ snap ] Oh , byrne , thank god . Quint- - Save yourself . Save your bullets for the grounders . Jaha : I take it you don 't approve . [ gunshots continue ] I asked you a question . Who cares what i think ? I do ... Or i wouldn 't have asked . I think the grounders can go to hell . I got you off work detail . Why ? You knew my son ... And i 'd like you to take me to his grave . Now that there 's a truce , It 's safe for me to go and say good-bye . Well , then you can get someone else to take you . I 'm told the graves are unmarked . You can show me which is his . Can hold the mop ... Or you can hold the gun . [ mop handle clatters ] [ gunshots continue ] Kane : Easy . Control your breathing . Squeeze the trigger . Don 't pull it . Sir , we got an audience . Hold your fire . Keep a solid stance . Observe . [ gunshots ] Would you like to try ? Kane : I could teach you . Your enemy has guns . So should you . It 's all right . I offered . We don 't need your weapons . Back to training , all of you . Kane : Guns could keep them alive . It 's like they 're afraid of them . They are . Legend has it , if a grounder picks up a gun , Even to shoot another grounder , Mount weather will wipe out Their entire village . Can 't have your blood supply defending themselves , right ? If we don 't arm them , We can 't win . Like hell , we can 't . We don 't know enough about these people . She sure seems to . Uh ! For my brother . Aagh ! Uh ! Aah ! Thank you . Where 's your guard ? He killed her . The kill is yours , clarke . [ roaring ] What is that ? Pauna . Aah ! Aah ! Run ! Aah ! Aagh ! Ohh ! [ roaring continues ] Uh ! Yaah ! Aah ! [ roaring ] We need to hide . This way . I found something . [ roaring continues ] [ panting ] Clarke : What is this place ? Lexa : It 's her feeding ground . [ roaring ] Let 's go . [ roaring continues ] [ snapping and rustling ] [ growling ] [ roaring ] [ thump thump ] [ roaring ] Run ! [ roaring ] Ohh ! Oh ... Uh ! Uh ! Leave me ! No way . [ roaring continues ] Uh ! Ok . Hold on . [ moaning ] Give me your sword . It 's extraordinary , isn 't it ? Oh , just give it a few days . I may not know everything that happened Before i got down here , but i do know something About what you 're feeling , son . Don 't call me that . I 'm nobody 's son . You made sure of that . I remember your father . Yeah , right . Alex murphy- - Convicted of theft of rationed medicine . He stole it to take care of you . I remember them all . We 're here- - home sweet home . Graveyard is this way . [ rain falling ] Come on . Let ' do this . [ thunder ] Ohh ... You about done ? We got to be heading back . How well did you know him ? Well enough to be hung for his murder . Clarke sugar-coated it for you , didn 't she ? What happened to my son ? 12-year-old girl stabbed him In the neck with the knife she took from me . Why would she do that ? She couldn 't kill you . Yeah . So you got a lot of blood On your hands , chancellor . Every single one of them , Including your son , would still be alive If you hadn 't sent us down here . If i didn 't send you , they would have died On the ark with the rest of us , And we would have never known That earth was survivable . Their sacrifice is why we are here . Good can come out of even the darkest acts , john . [ sighs ] [ sighs ] Camp you is that way . We 'll rest at the dropship for a while . Suit yourself . [ warriors shouting ] Time for one more ? Step aside , sky girl . We 're hungry . Make me . Fio ... Give this girl what she wants . Uh ! Sir ? It 's all right . Let it go . Let 's do this . Hey , are you gonna give up that easily ? Indra : She wants more , oblige her . Indra , stop this . [ panting ] Huh ! Uh ! Uh ... Ohh ! Uh ! Aagh ! Uh ! Ugh ! [ panting ] [ spits ] [ coughs ] I got you . Huh ? Oh . I got you . What are you trying to prove ? [ coughs ] Yeah . What doesn 't kill you Makes you stronger . You should 've left me behind . Now two will die here instead of one . I 'm still new to your culture , But when someone saves your life , My people say thank you . I 'm serious , clarke . To lead well , you must make hard choices . Hard choices ? You 're telling me that ? I 've seen your strength--it 's true- - But now you waver . You couldn 't kill quint , Couldn 't leave me to die . That was weakness . I thought love was weakness . Mockery is not the product Of a strong mind , clarke . You want to know why i saved you ? Because i need you . God forbid one of your generals becomes commander . You may be heartless , lexa , But at least you 're smart . Don 't worry . My spirit will choose Much more wisely than that . Your spirit ? When i die , my spirit will find The next commander . Reincarnation . That 's how you became commander . How are your leaders chosen ? [ slamming ] [ roaring ] It found us . Don 't be afraid , clarke . Death is not the end . We are not dying here . I need your spirit to stay where it is . Then get ready to fight . He 's coming in . Maybe we let it in . Over here . Now ! [ roaring ] Go ! [ roaring continues ] Let 's go . Uh ... Oh ... Oh ... [ exhales ] What do you want ? You fought like a child today- - All aggression , no thought , No defense , always leaving yourself Exposed , revealing your next move Before each strike . Ok . I know . I got my ass kicked . That should make you happy . It does ... Because you did not give up . Strength of spirit like that is rare . It must be guided . Do you know what a warrior 's second is ? An apprentice . I can make you a great warrior , Octavia of the sky people , If you 're willing to do what it takes To become my second . What 's in it for you ? First lesson- - never question me . Ok . I 'm in . Good . We 'll start tomorrow . [ hatch opens and closes ] You sure ? You must be hungry . No one gives anything Without expecting something in return . That 's a cynical way to go through life , john . You pull me off work detail . You offer me food . Why are you being so nice to me ? Everyone deserves a second chance . That 's why we sent the 100 To the earth in the first place . What a load of crap . You didn 't give a damn about us . You still don 't . That 's why you 're not fighting for those kids In mount weather . I have to think of everyone . I know you don 't want to hear this , But sometimes you have to sacrifice a few To save the many . Like i said , good can come Out of even the darkest acts . Then you can take it from me That no good has come from any of this . I was pardoned , slate wiped clean . I 'm still treated like dirt . You made mistakes . So have i . Well , i 'm nothing like you , chancellor . No ? We both should 've died several times over . We both have suffered At the hands of the grounders . We both have been betrayed and imprisoned By our own people . So there 's no place for either of us , then . Great . Thought you were supposed To be inspiring . There is a place for all of us . When i first landed on the earth , I met a woman who spoke of a place Beyond the dead zone , A place where everyone is accepted ... A city of light . Heh . That sounds like a fairy tale . Or a second chance . You don 't even know if it 's real . You 're right- - i don 't--but i believe . Ok . Well , that 's good for you , chancellor . [ pat pat ] Very good . I 'm gonna find it , john ... And once i do , I 'm gonna come back and lead my people home . Why are we stopping ? [ breathing deeply ] You ok ? A soon as they open the intake doors , We attack . Do not let it close . Once they 're all dead , you go in . I 'll make it look like you escaped . Once you 're inside- - i know . [ distant conversation ] Another raider party . What are you doing ? We have to go back . It 's the only way . Go back ? No way . There 's 3 , maybe 4 . We can fight our way through . We 'll never get a better chance than this . I thought i could do this , but i can 't . It 's over . No . It 's not . We can join them . Listen to me . When they bring out the red , You grab it , and you run like hell . The reapers will go nuts , The grounders will run , And the mountain men have to deal with it . No one will be looking for a grounder Running into the mountain . I said no ! Rrgh ! Fight back . They 'll think i 'm trying to escape . [ both grunting ] [ sizzling ] Eat . Get strong . Only then will we win this war . Thank you . Man : Yeah . Yeah . Let 's line up . Let 's line up right here . Woman : Yeah . Sure . You did this . Thank you . You 're welcome . Don 't blow it . Hmm . The boar put up more of a fight than you . I see you 're making friends . What do you want from me ? What do you think is gonna happen Once we get your friends back ? For now , we have a common goal , But one day , this war is gonna end . What then ? Just get to the point . We know so little about them . You 've earned their respect . I need you to be my eyes and ears . You 're asking me to be a spy ? I 'm asking you To look out for your people . I am . [ people talking indistinctly ] Jaha : We 're glad you could make it . Thank you . Glad you could make it . What the hell is this ? We 're going to the city of light . You 're going now ? There 's a million ways to die out there . Well , if it 's not your time , nothing can kill you , But if it is your time , it only takes one . Right . You even have a map ? No . Then how do you know where you 're going ? We don 't , but i will not be ruled by fear . You want to stop being treated like a criminal , Then you have to stop thinking that that 's all you are . Take this leap of faith with me , john murphy , And let me show you there 's so much more For you than this . [ distant roar ] It 's ok . You 're safe . How 's your arm ? Hurts . [ roaring continues ] We should go . That cage won 't hold forever . Wait . [ sighs ] I was wrong about you , clarke . Your heart shows no sign of weakness . [ roaring continues ] The cage won 't hold . I think i know how to take mount weather . We 've been trying to get inside , But they 've already let us in . What are you talking about ? Your army is already there Locked in cages . We just need someone on the inside To let them out . Bellamy . You have faith in him ? I do . I hope your faith is well-placed Because if he can 't get inside , we can 't win . He will . Lexa , this is gonna work . Come on . [ beep ] Stay back , or you won 't get your dose . [ beep ] First dose up . [ syringe whooshes ] Next . [ syringe whooses ] Harvest . Next . Harvest . [ syringe whooshes ] Next . Come on . Next . Let 's move it . [ syringe whooshes ] Harvest them all . Come on . Let 's go . Uh ! [ beep ]

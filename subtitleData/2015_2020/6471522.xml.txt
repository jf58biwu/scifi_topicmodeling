 Previously on " Heroes Reborn " ...

Got to go back , save my sister , save the world . Where am I ? We are ready to link into the processor . Start the presentation . By now , you all know the dire circumstances our planet faces .

Hello ? Hello ? No , wait ! Wait ! Come back ! I was kind of hoping Bennet would end up here too . There 's no one even guarding the place . There 's no one left to guard . Hey , guys , guys . Take a look at that . It 's the first solar flare . We need to take cover . There , come on . - Come on , come on . - Let 's go ! No , I didn 't come all this way just to hide . Let 's have this discussion inside ! I have to do something ! If that solar flare hits , there won 't be much of a world left when Tommy gets back . The prophecy--your prophecy- - it is not time yet . I have to do something . This is not your fate . It 's mine . I cannot be forgiven for the things that I 've done , but you saved my life , and I have got to believe that there 's a reason for that . Luke , please ... don 't . Quentin , no matter what happens , you keep her in here and make sure she gets to that clock tower . What about you , man ? What about you ? What are you doing ? Hey ! No , no , no ! You 're being crazy , man ! Luke ! Luke ! I got it , the bullet . Nice trick . Told you I could find it . There we go . There we go . Malina ? She 's okay . They headed to Gateway . Hello ? We need some help . There was a pileup on I-20 . We 've got more injured coming . Where is everyone ? They 're all gone . Please- - my daughter . Looks like we 're staying here . Please , wait . Come back , please . You got to go back now . You got to go back . You need to remember . Who are you ? I 'm you . Me ? What ? How is that possible ? We can be in two places at once . How long have you- - we been in here ? Time has no meaning here , only memories . Memories ? They trick us into perceiving time as a straight line , with a past and a future , but really , time- - time is a circle . And memories are timeless . Every moment of our life , it exists in this place- - every memory . My memories were erased . Not in here . But you got to think deep , or you , our sister , everyone in the world is gonna die . And we 'll be stuck in this loop forever . Focus on- - on a moment . Our childhood , where we came from ... I--I don 't know . I can 't remember . You already have . Mom , what 's wrong ? Oh , Nathan , come here . The world 's about to change . Tonight in New York 's Central Park , the shocking moment caught on tape as a young woman jumps from a Ferris wheel and miraculously heals in front of rolling camera . My name is Claire Bennet . This is attempt number ... I guess I 've kind of lost count . Rapid cellular regeneration , with some experts calling this a leap forward in human evolution . And she may not be alone . Who is she ? She 's your mother . - I don 't understand . - I know , baby . It 's time you knew the truth . Do you ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary ? - The comic book you love .. - " 9th Wonders ! " ? You have more in common with your favorite character than you think . Hiro Nakamura ? You are different , Tommy . You 'll always be different . The boy is like his uncle and his great-grandfather . He can absorb powers . My name 's Hiro Nakamura , former Master of Time and Space . _ _ I love you . Be brave . You 're the best son a dad could ever have . I 'm ready . I 'm ready to save the world . What is that ? Satellite debris from the first flare . We 're running out of time . We 'd better get you to the clock tower . My grandmother 's vision was of me under the clock tower , not hiding inside it . Malina , the debris will kill you . We can wait it out in here . It 's a pretty solid structure . Phoebe ? Phoebe , no ! Phoebe , no ! Quentin ? Quentin ? No ! No ! Damn it ! Quentin ! Phoebe ! Phoebe ! Let go of me ! Phoebe ! Let me go ! Phoebe ! Stop it ! Phoebe , it 's over . Why are you helping her ? Erica 's coming back . No , she 's not . She was never taking us back with her . Okay ? She used us . She used you to get what she wanted . No . No , that 's not true . Erica made you into a monster . She made you into a monster , Phoebe . And I let it happen . And I 'm sorry , but we were wrong . You 're lying ! This isn 't you , Phoebe ! Just come with me . We can fix this . There 's only one thing left to fix . Don 't do this ! No ! Phoebe ! Malina , no ! I don 't understand . Why doesn 't she know you ? Evo regeneration grid online . Power station is operational again . I found the source of the problem . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ So ... my boyfriend 's stuck inside your video game . Erica Kravid forced me to put him into a prison of my own design . Now someone must enter the game and free him- - someone who knows " Evernow " as well as its maker . I 'm just a gamer . You 've spent hundreds of hours in " Evernow " - - the best player I 've ever seen , and most importantly , you have the heart of a warrior . That 's why I chose you . Now ... _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ It 's time . _ _ _ When I was , like , seven , these people took me to this place because of my power . I remember a room filled with toys and stuff . No windows . It 's kind of hazy . No . No , I don 't want to see this one ! Nathan ? I 'd like you to meet Malina ... your sister . Do you two ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary ? I know , because I have dreamt about you since before you were born . Now that your abilities have matured , we need to test the symbiotic bond you share . Don 't be frightened . I promise you both you won 't remember any of this . Shouldn 't Noah be here to see it ? His plan depended on him not knowing any of this . We stick to that . Now take each other 's hands . Stop ! This again ? I know what to do ! You 've got to go back . Who are you ? I 'm you . Me ? What ? How is that possible ? We can be in two places at once . _ _ _ No , wait . I don 't understand . _ _ Whoa . Hello , Tommy . Go--go back . Go- - Did you really think you could escape without me knowing ? It 's over , Tommy . My name is Nathan . And you can 't stop someone who can stop time . Time travel- - it 's a bitch . The future we 're standing in exists only because the H.E.L.E. happened . The moment you go back and stop it , all of this- - all of us- - will cease to exist . So which world are you going to choose ? The one with your sister or the one with your girlfriend and your mother and the thousands of innocent people that you ... brought here ? Let me make it easier for you . Time 's running out , and one of these worlds has to die . You can 't save both . You can 't be in- - - Two places at once . Even Hiro Nakamura couldn 't do that . I can . Hiro Nakamura prepared me my entire life for this . And now I 've had an eternity in " Evernow " to practice , thanks to you . No . That 's impossible ! It 's about time ! It 's too strong ! Come on . You can share my power . Come on . Come on ! I don 't understand . It 's not working . What 's happening to us ? It wasn 't supposed to be like this ! Something 's wrong . Let go ! - Let go ! - I can 't ! Let go ! I 've got to go back . Now ... take each other 's hands . They 're going to die ! Stop them ! It 's okay . You 're safe . No ! He 's dead . It didn 't work . They will die if they come together . They need a conduit ... someone between them willing to sacrifice themselves . Now that your abilities have matured , we need to test the symbiotic bond you share . Take each other 's hands . They are dying ! Stop them ! It 's okay . You 're safe now . He 's dead . They will die if they come together . They need a conduit ... someone between them willing to sacrifice themselves . It all makes sense now . There was a third person in my dreams : a faceless figure . Who ? Who is that going to be ? I think I know exactly who it was . I tried everything . I went back 1,000 times , but we always failed . We--we needed you . - So I went back to- - - You saved me . I would have died in that storm . Yes . I 'm sorry , but you had to see this . I followed the tiniest thread , just like my dad taught me . The smallest butterfly . Save you , save the world . What do we do ? Take me back to Gateway- - to the end of the world . Malina ! Grandpa ? It 's okay . I 've got you . There 's got to be another way . You two have your destiny . This is mine . It 's time to save the world . No ! No . No , no , no , no . Hey . You 're gonna be okay . Gonna get you to the hospital . So , so sorry . I am ... so proud of you ... both . So proud . No . No , no , no , no . No , no . - Hey , hey , hey . - No ! No , please . Please . Can 't keep me here forever . I have rights . Here 's the thing , Quentin . We know you were there . You saw how it went down . These Evos save the whole world and don 't ask for a thing in return . No one does that . So the question is , who are they ? You want to know who they are ? They 're somebody 's sister , somebody 's brother , daughter , son , grandchild . See , you people- - you people want them to be extraordinary . But they 're not . They couldn 't be more ordinary . The only thing extraordinary is that they got a chance to be heroes . A tad excessive , maybe ? When are you guys gonna let me come fight crime with you ? What kind of uncle would I be if I took you with me ? I don 't know- - best uncle ever ? They didn 't think about themselves . They just did the right thing . And now they just want to be left alone ... Oh . So they can scratch out some small purpose that can give their life some meaning , community , hope , like all the rest of us . And when that darkness rolls in- - and it will- - they 'll be here , ready for the call , up for the task , without us even having to ask . What is it ? I don 't know . See , this is just the beginning , man- - an awakening . And now my eyes are open - wide open . They were here to save us . So you want to know who they are ? Look in the mirror . They 're you , they 're me , on our best day . So there you go . That 's who they are . How was your first day ? I found this . On the card is twins . When I touched it , I ... got this feeling like someone was watching me . You know what this is , don 't you ? It 's a message from your father , Malina . It means he 's coming back for you and your brother . And this time , no one will be able to protect you .

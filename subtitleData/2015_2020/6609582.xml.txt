 OK , Rachel , let 's begin . I 'm going to flash the light on your eye . Now off . On . Now off . Yes . I 've gleaned the pattern , thank you . Any discomfort to report ? - No . - Restricted motility ? - Unusual discharge ? - No . It looks like Pluto . Pluto isn 't even a planet , you know . It 's a runt . - Like your eye . - That 's not very nice . How would you like if I teased you about your ... m-mmm ... malformed leg ? - I wouldn 't let it bother me . - You say that ... but you don 't get to decide what bothers you or not . That 's why it bothers you . - Like our friend Ira here ... - Follow the pen please . I can see it 's still quite photo-sensitive . You 've been away . What makes you say that ? You 've missed three consecutive treatments . Reinforcing my suspicion that wherever we are is somewhat isolated . A day 's journey out and back . She thinks you went to fetch Professor Duncan . Locked in this room for six weeks without a single visit . When can I expect her ? You shouldn 't expect anything . I 'm going to apply a small amount - of Neomycin ... - Yes , I know the process . And you 're a pale shade of Castor , aren 't you ? Your brothers may be lackeys , but ... - at least they 're men . - As I have never met them , I don 't carry the same ... antipathy towards my siblings as you . Chin , please . I know Susan 's back . - She 's watching us right now . - No one is watching . Ew ! Pigment treatment ; - I hate this part . - It 's what 's necessary for her eye to look normal again . Sync and Corrected by : Abody _ 92 @ AbodyMohammad Now that the tomb door has been opened , my cave spiders can take their rightful place in the unholy depth . Your roll , fair Cindrel . Your mom will be up soon . They never tell me when things are bad ... - Holy cow ! - What 's it doing to me ? It looks like it 's latched on . You see that ? There 's some kind of ... attaching mechanism . Is it penetrating the maxillary artery ? What does that mean , " penetrating the artery " ? Why would it do that ? We 'd be guessing . So guess . What 's it doing to me ? Oh ... looks like there 's some non-organic core . See that in the tissue ? That could hold a payload . Well , it 's not a tracking device . At least not primarily . - It 's way too overbuilt for that . - And it must produce an anesthetic . Like a leech when it latches on . - That 's why she doesn 't feel it . - What does it do ? I 'm sorry , Sarah . I 'm ... Without further study , there 's no way of knowing . This one 's igneous . This one 's sedimentary . Did you learn that in your online courses ? - Mm-hmm . - Lucky you . I 'm not allowed a computer , much less a window to the world . What 's " Adam 's Rib " ? An archaic ... religious reference . Where did you hear that ? Ugh ! Ugh ! I knew you were back . Hello , Rachel . Good ! Look at you ; - that is demonstrable progress . - You can go to hell ! If I can 't find M.K. , I need to find this " Dizzy " guy . - Who now ? - The guy who showed me the video . Maybe he knows how to take it out without killing me . Listen to me . I have reached out . We are going to find a doctor who can remove it . But you have to get some rest . When did you last get any sleep ? I need to tell Fee . OK . At least , I know where to find you there . Sarah , if Felix wants to search for his blood family , we have to support him . I can 't think about that right now . Let 's see if you can stand up to the power of Lord Merrick Farrow . You 're still with me ? - Kira , what are you doing ? - This game is stupid . Kira ! Ah ! Hey , what 's going on here ? I knocked over the game . - You did ? ! - It was just an accident . Hey , you behave , alright ? Got a lot to do today . I 'll be back soon . Yeah , sorry . S is downstairs if you need her . Ah , do you have to go so deep ? Honey , if I don 't go deep , I 'm not gonna feel anything . You 're gonna want to get all the way to the back . Right behind the wisdom tooth . I 'm definitely pretty far back there . - Ooh ! - OK , uh , now slide your finger down into the cheek . - Anything there ? - Honey , honey , be still , be still . No . - Feels normal . Both sides . - God ! What ... What is that godforsaken thing ? Is it harming Sarah ? Apparently , Neolutionists get them , like , voluntarily . Some kind of research device maybe . Biometric data collection ? We just ... We don 't know . Wait , they 're in Neolutionists ? According to Sarah 's contact , yeah . If you had one to study , would that - be helpful ? - Invaluable . Yeah , why ? Just thinking out loud . Ali , we are not going to exhume the dead guy in our garage ! That is a haywire plan . Donnie , my sister has a robot maggot in her face . You tell me what the solid plan is . Exactly . Now , go rent a jackhammer . Maybe we should just buy one . Felix ? Hey ! Hi ! Who are you ? Oh , you 're expecting Felix . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . My brain 's a little ... Splat ! Hahaha ! Yeah , he said he had a hook-up . He must 've pulled the trigger , I just gotta find my bag . Uh , mind you , I was picturing a fat-legged man wearing Crocs . No offense . It 's just how you all look where I come from . Haha ! Haaa ... Is it molly that we 're getting ? - I ... - You know what ? Don 't matter . I 'm not that choosy this time in the morning . Here we are . Alright . How much do I owe you , honey ? Who are you ? Why are you going through Felix 's stuff ? Wow , you are protective ... for a drug dealer . - You don 't see that very often . - Adele ! You should see how crisp it looks outside . It 's like ... - Oh , shit . - What 's this all about then ? Sarah , this is Adele , This is my biological sister . - Hi ! - This is my foster sister . Oh , Sarah ! I ... Hahaha ! I 'm such a halfwit ! Oh , of course , you 're Sarah ! Wow ! You don 't happen to be a drug dealer too , - do you ? - Not anymore , no . Oh , OK . That would have been too handy . Well , this calls for a celebration . Actually , Adele , I need to talk to my brother . Privately . If you 'd mind ... Uh-huh . Absolutely , yeah . Two . What ? What is wrong with you ? What ? ! I told you that I was gonna look for my family ! - I didn 't know you met her . - She is so bloody cool ! OK , you are gonna think she 's amazing . She 's a lawyer . Or she was , but there 's some kind of , like , " disbarment " situation - or something , so she 's ... - How high are you right now ? Quite , I 'd say , If I had to put a number to it . Why ? Well , something came up , so tell her you need to rain check . No , I will not . It 's important , Fee . This might come as a shock to you , but this is important to me , too . This is a profound moment for me . How do you even know she 's your sister . She 's probably a Neolutionist plant . Adele ! What 's your favourite colour ? Red . - What 's your favourite drink ? - Oh , this one 's nice . You ever had sex for material gain ? Haha ! Who hasn 't ? C 'mon ! I can see you 're upset , I get it , but this means a lot to me . And frankly , I 'm not just gonna drop all my shit yet again , because you 're short a sidekick . Then you can piss off . Great . You too then . Here . Thank you , Donnie Hendrix . Uh , I need you to watch the kids for a few hours . Alison and I have a project in the garage . What is project ? Nothing for you to worry about . Sarah won 't answer my calls . I can help with trouble . Sometimes , your kind of " help " isn 't the kind that 's needed . Know what I mean ? Uh , just ... gestate and watch the kids . And nobody goes in the garage . Clear ? Like crystals . Great . Hey , why don 't we close that fridge door ? Alright . Who the hell are you ? I just want to talk . Can I come in ? You stole my phone . Brought it back . I 'm Sarah . I 'm M.K. ' s sister . Didn 't mean to lie , just was trying to find her . Yeah ... Listen , whatever your deal is , I 'm gonna take a pass . Yeah . Hey . Holy Jesus ! Just give me five minutes . I started hearing some chatter a couple of months ago . Piece of tech like that turns up , word travels pretty fast . What do people think it 's for ? There 's a bunch of theories . Biometrics monitor . Delivery system , like , for insulin . Narcotics . What do you think it 's for ? I think , uh ... you 're not gonna like my answer . I don 't like any of the answers . Why place it in the jaw , where so much can go wrong ? If it 's for insulin , like , why not your thigh - or your gut ? - I don 't know , you tell me . Proximity to the brain ... Jesus ... You know what , don 't mind me . It 's just a theory . I need to get in touch with M.K. How do you contact her ? How do I contact my own sister ? - What 's that all about ? - I didn 't even know I had one till a couple days ago . Well , you don 't find M.K. ; she finds you . But if you wanna tell me what 's going on ... maybe I could help . You can help me by telling me who that guy in the video is . Please , I need to get it out . Word going around , his name was Alonzo Martinez . I should think you 'd be grateful , Rachel : testing one of the first cybernetic eyes . Back on your feet again thanks to Ira 's help . Perhaps she 's upset because her pituitary hormone therapy has given her facial hair . Nonsense ! Can 't see it at all . Why else would she disappear for two months without a word ? Now I smell it . You failed to find the original , haven 't you ? So , Sarah Manning and her people have outfoxed us again . While you leave Castor and Leda alone in a ... bloody terrarium ! Well , at least she 's kind to Charlotte . Yes , I 'm glad you 're forming a bond with the child . She 's had an unfortunate series of guardians . Charlotte was cloned from you , you know . " Adam 's rib ... " 400 attempts , I believe . Not a viable way to replicate you , but ... - important nonetheless . - Get out ! - I beg your pardon ? - I prefer to eat alone . I have given you ... everything . the keys to the future , and your obsession with Sarah Manning blinded you . You failed to find the original . You failed to cure us by other means . Just leave me here to die alone . You are the failure , Rachel . You carry my last name and you are the biggest disappointment of you all ! Why would you upset her like that ? Ah ! Ah , Jesus ! There it is ! Is it ... soft ? Oh , God , must be like a root cellar down there keeping him moist . Oh , God , the smell ! Bear down , Donnie . - Almost there . - Smells like hot garbage juice ! - What ? ! - I said it smells ... It smells like hot garbage juice . - Sarah ! - Hey . Jesus , you OK ? Yeah . Come on in . - Ah ! Ah ! - The missing cheek case ; - that 's what Beth was onto . - Yeah . - Implanted Neolution tech . - God , Sarah ! They put one of these things in your mouth too ? I 'm too scared to even bloody brush my teeth , Art . Oh Jesus , Sarah . Art , I have to get this thing out . - You really do . - S and Benjamin are looking into doctors , but I don 't know which doctors gonna even know what to do with this . It exploded in that guy 's face . Wait , you said you had a name . Maybe I can help . - Alonzo Martinez . - OK . Listen , I 'm gonna head down to the station and see what I can dig up , OK ? Sarah , you stay here . Get some rest . You look like you need it . Thanks . Yeah . I met Julian Schnabel once ... at a retrospective in LA . I was sort of bulimic at the time , so I thought ... Thank you . - You 're welcome . - I thought it would be fun to leave a puddle of barf in front - of Dog in the Revolving Door . - What ? ! - Hahaha ! - Oh , my God , what I would give - to barf on a Schnabel ! Jesus ! - Hahaha ! Now , Felix ... I know you didn 't go to all the trouble of finding me - for a drinking buddy . - No . Alright . OK . Your dad , my dad ... so weird . - It 's crazy . - He was an American , and he had an affair in England with a dancer . - That 's right . - I barely knew my birth mom actually ' cause , you know , she died , like , I was really young . And then I fell into the foster system , then I bounced around here and there for a bit until Siobhan adopted me . - Do you remember your mom ? - It 's more like I ... have a sense of her . Like , you know , I can feel her presence or I got this sensation . Beam of sunlight comes through the window - and falls just a certain way . - Hmm ... Yeah , but so your mom , she knew then ? About the affair , yeah . Yeah , not about you . That came out on his deathbed , so ... I spat in a cup for Gene Connexion . Here we are . Family science . So , what does your other family think about you looking for your roots ? Your foster sister seemed like she was pretty upset . To be honest ? You know , I don 't really care . - Helena . - Sestra , you finally answered . - I have news to tell you . - Yes . Sorry I haven 't been ... - I am having twins . - Oh ... Meathead , that 's huge . - Are you OK ? - Yes , much OK . Because I know they will always have each other . Like us . - But , sestra , Can I say something ? - Yeah , yeah . I don 't want them to grow up like me . Yeah . I get that feeling . Doorbellings . I have to go . OK , you , uh , rub that belly for me . - I will rub it . - OK . Mrs. Hendrix ? I 'm Detective Lindstein , this is Detective Collier . - Hello . - We 're investigating a triple homicide at a local garage - a few weeks back . - Can we come in ? We just have a couple of questions , Mrs. Hendrix . Won 't take long . Yes , I will kindly offer to take your coats ... No , we 're good . After examinations , forensics were able to place the incidents at 12 to 24 hours before his arrival on the scene , putting it at some time during the previous day . We 're building a timeline of that day , so any details could help . Hello , husband Donald . - Some detectives are here . - Ah ... - OK . Uh , what is this pertaining to ? - Homicide . Of several Portuguese . - Mm-hmm . - Why don 't you join us , Mr. Hendrix ? Yeah , of course , of course . I 'll just ... - get myself cleaned up a bit . - I will continue to be hostess . OK , honey . Ah ... Abort ! Abort ! - Heavens ! What is it ? - Police . Living room . - With Helena ! - For this ? ! No . For Pouchy 's garage . Donnie ! Christ on a crab cake ! Get in there , Donnie ! Go ! It 's from Benjamin . He might have found a doctor who can help Sarah . Oh ... You want me to keep an eye on Kira ? - Is that OK ? Do you mind . - Yeah . Of course . Thank you . Chicken ... I , uh ... I have to go out , just for a little while , but you stay here with Auntie Cosima . I 'll let you know if Benjamin 's found someone to help . Hey ... Should we do a little science experiment ? Hey ? Kira ? Oof ... you 're exhausted , eh ? Why don 't we go make a little nap nest on the couch ? - Yeah ? - I was dreaming . - Just now ? - All the aunties were there . You set Mom on fire . You know we 'd never do that , right ? No . You had to . She was changing . How was she changing ? I don 't know . I couldn 't see . These were found at the scene of the crime . Oh , gosh , they were supporters . That makes this tragedy - even worse . - Yes , this doubles it . Can I offer you some breads ? We 're fine , thanks . The victims were known to police , but not exactly - for their civic engagement . - Which is a little odd , considering their interest in your wife 's campaign . Did you know the Pouzihno family ? - No . - No . No , never met them . Did you meet them ? - No , they died . - Well , before ? No . We 're gonna need to know who had access to your campaign materials , starting with your campaign manager . My campaign manager ? - Sarah Stubbs . - Sarah Stubbs . - That 's right , Sarah Stubbs . - Mr. Hendrix , when we ask your wife a question , you need to let her answer . Hahaha ! I ... I don 't know if that 's true . Actually . I 'm just saying , legally , I don 't think that 's true . So ... other than this Sarah Stubbs , who else had involvement in your campaign , Mrs. Hendrix ? Carol Lombart was coordinator , Trevor Sawatzky did transportation , and Kathy Melichi hung posters . But my biggest support was my husband . He 's my rock . - Good to see you . - Yes , thank you . Goodbye . How the hell did Helena know all that ? I don 't know . She 's a trained assassin . That 's what they do ; they " shrak " people , and ... observe things . Oh , dear . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! - AH ! Oh ! - AH ! God ! Ah , Jesus Christ ! Ah ! God ! Oh , come on . Don 't ... No ! - Oh , God ! - Oh , God ! Holy Jesus , what is that ? What is that ? I think ... I think that 's what we need . Ira said you made Susan lose her temper . Yes . I shouldn 't have , but I did . We all ... need to work harder at being a family . How are your online courses ? - Fine . - Are you still - studying geology ? - Yes . I 'm learning about magma , how it explodes up from the molten core and goes sizzling into the sea . Magma has always been here , you know ? Has it really ? It 's older than us . Older than dinosaurs . Then Magma , I suppose , is Mother Nature . Darling ... W-what is that ? Nothing . It happens when I cough sometimes . - Hey , what did you find ? - That my Spanish is pretty shitty . But your man Martinez had a local address last year , until he moved back to Bogota . But check this out : four months ago , he comes into town , stays one night , and then flies back home again . It was a long trip for a short visit . Yeah . His credit-card records show that he took a cab from his hotel room to the corner of Queen and Broadview and then back home . That 's it . - What 's at Queen and Broadview ? - Get this : it 's a dental clinic specializing in implants . Listen , I gotta bounce , OK ? I 'm gonna check it out , Art . You check in with me about an hour , alright ? - Yeah , I will . - OK . Marty , right ? - Yeah . - Yeah , you worked my partner 's shooting . Union Steward . - That 's right . Art Bell ? - That 's right . But see , it 's bugging me because I know that you paid her a visit at home . - O-O-OK . Yeah . - See , that doesn 't usually happen . House calls . Sometimes , it does . When I 'm personally concerned for the officer 's well-being . - You know ? - Right . Well , I appreciate that then . - Thanks . - OK . Cosima , we found something that might help Sarah , - but we need some assistance . - Right . Right and , um , just to give you a little background , um ... You know what ? One second , Cosima . Why do we have to tell her where it came from ? Let 's just tell her we procured it . Maybe she 'll let it slide . She 's a scientist and a lesbian ; she 's not gonna let it slide . So , uh , the thing is , a few months ago , there was an occurrence that ... occurred on a cold autumn night . It was very rainy ... I remember that distinctly ... and the wipers on that car were - crap , so I was having tr ... - Donnie . Anyway , one thing led to another , and I did shoot Doctor Leekie and bury him in the garage , - but ... but , but , but ... - What ? ! it looks like he has one of those Neolutionist things in his face , so sometimes , stuff works out . You killed Aldous Leekie ? Boy , did I ever . Yeah . Cosima , there will be time to debate the do 's and don 'ts of certain decisions later , but you said you needed one of these things , and we 've gone to great lengths to find one . So do you want it or not ? - Yeah . Uh ... - Good , then ! Someone with science knowledge has to come get it because right now it 's encased in so kind of awful polyp . OK ? Great ! I 'm good . No , I 'm not good . Donnie , use a towel ! Oh , my God ! All done ? That 's fine . Thank you , have a seat . Beth ! Are you crazy ? You can 't be here . - Who saw you come in ? - No one . OK . Come , come , just uh ... I told you , OK ? I 'm done . No more . I wouldn 't have come - if it wasn 't important . - They know you 're digging , Beth . But you covered for me , - right ? - How could you ask me that ? I just ... I don 't want to put you in a tough spot . Of course I covered for you . I 'm as upset about all of this as you are . But I 'm exposed here , OK ? I signed an NDA . I 've witnessed the procedures . The procedures ... They do it on purpose . They bring me in , so now I 'm just as guilty as everyone . Because I stood there , I watched . Like ... with Martinez ? How did you know about that ? Alonzo Martinez came here . Right ? Look , I 'm sorry , I 've said all I can . You need you to go . What if I told you that they did the procedure to me ? You came to get it out ... Can you ? Well , I can , but ... it 's really dangerous , Beth . But you know how to do it ? You could do it . OK , wait here . Leave a message ; call you back . Benjamin , where are you ? I 'm still waiting . Somebody call for a doctor ? - Ferdinand . - I hope you 're better at protecting the Original than your communication networks . How did you find me ? Where 's Benjamin ? He 's fine . I thought we were friends , Siobahn . You killed 2 of my friends , so that would be a no . - What do you want ? - Would you believe I 'm looking for love ? Well , I 'm concerned because you 're investigating Neolution tech . Seeking a doctor with a certain expertise , why ? Maybe you and I could help one another . What would you have that I would want ? I know a thing or two about bots . Like how dangerous they can be . Someone in your organization has one . Kira ? Sarah ? There 's a Neo network here that does them . I know who they are . And what would you want in return ? - Hello ? - Yeah , it 's Art . - Sarah 's not answering her phone . - She 's with Felix . No she 's not . She was supposed to check in an hour ago . She was investigating a dental clinic . Yes , I think she could be in trouble . Just finishing up a few things . I 'll see you tomorrow , OK ? Good night ! - OK , have a good night ! - Bye ! I 'm just , um ... a little unclear on what the devices are for . Right , OK , so I 'm gonna get you to open up . Great . OK , now this might pinch just a little bit , OK ? OK , good . Beth , if the pain gets to be too much at any point , I just want you to let me know . - Uh-huh . - OK ? So open up . Yup ! - Mm-hm . - Here we go ... OK ... Uh . - Does that hurt ? - Uh ! Sh ... No , no , no . No movement . OK ? Alright . OK . OK , so , um , I 've penetrated the device , which now means that the slightest movement on your part will cause it to erupt . Do you understand ? Don 't nod , just blink once if you understand . OK . If you do move , a burst of tendrils will release a fatal dose of tetrodotoxin . So , again , just need you to ... blink once so that you understand . Great . Beth , I 'm so sorry , but you really don 't know what you 're getting into here . I had to call my superiors , so ... Well , they 'll probably be here any minute . But until then , honestly ? No movement . It is ... it is super critical . God . You know , when you first came sniffing around here , Misdirect you , send you on your way . But nobody told me you 'd be coming back . Or that you 're one of the test subjects . God ! You don 't know how lucky you are to be chosen for this . Oh thank God , they 're here . Don 't move . Sarah . What ? I can 't understand a word you 're saying with that thing in your mouth . Be still ... Nothing to worry about . If she 'd punctured it , you 'd already be dead ! What the hell are you doing here ? Earlier today I received some rather interesting news from Rachel . Susan Duncan is alive . What ? It 's my curse . Detachment . I 've spent my whole life observing you , but I don 't know how ... to be with you . Because you abandoned me . Father thought Neolution murdered you , but you are Neolution . So are you . I 'm sorry , Rachel . I wanted to be your mother , but it was necessary to cut the cord . You raised a Castor clone instead . Please be kind to Ira . Castor was never completely under my control to be raised homogeneously like that . I wanted him to be different . And me ? Raised by Aldous Leekie . Sent off to boarding school . Topside . Helsinki . You weren 't supposed to know about ... Helsinki . Well I do . And yet , here I am . Rachel , you are the experiment . One day , you may take over . But be patient . Recover ! Everyone needs a purpose in life . Ours is all in service ... of the greater good . What is it , Mother ? What is our greater good ? To control human evolution , darling . To create a more perfect human being . Sync and Corrected by : Abody _ 92 @ AbodyMohammad

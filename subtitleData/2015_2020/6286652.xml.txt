 Previously on " Defiance " ... When an Omec Commander dies his children eat his vital organs and gain his strength . So now his unhinged , unstoppable daughter is at the head of 10,000 Omec . Under Kindzi 's command the Omec will attempt to conquer this planet . It is time for our Dread Harvest to begin . Come on , Enchanters . Come and take a taste of Datak Tarr . None of these are Kindzi . She 's still out there somewhere . With more on the way . My father 's dead because of you . He 's dead because you murdered him . What is that I hear ? Please . Please . No ! No ! Please , I beg you , spare the child , and you may take my life in return . I do not require permission to kill you . Then take the most precious gift I have to offer ... My free will . Spare this child and I shall love you as my Enchanter . I will obey your commands , I will serve you , pleasure you . And when my usefulness to you has ended , my body will provide nourishment . Your offer is a good one , but I will still kill the child . No , no , no ... You 've upset my wife ! How is she still alive ? We should leave , go . Come on , come ! Go ! Get to the roller . - Don 't make me trip . - Let 's go ! Are you all right ? I am now . She killed Andina . You know , she would have killed us too if Mom hadn 't kept her talking . You saved Luke . I did no more than any mother would have done for her child . No more than Christie did . Don 't push your luck . You are healing well . Forget my injury . Why are the skies clear ? Why are there no new arrivals ? We had nothing to feed them . I thought it prudent we halt the protocol until we had time to discuss the matter . As a group . _ Look at what the ursu sedolaz have done to our family . There is but seven of us left . We must return to the ship . _ _ And I will not be questioned ! You need nourishment for the hunt ? Eat this . Omec cannot eat Omec . Are you refusing my order ? Of course not ... _ You honor us with this gift . Let us grow our strength , so we can hunt for food in town . I will go reactivate the pods and bring down more of our family . Let 's start by focusing on the positive . Good news here is that by cutting off the Omec food supply we 've forced them to go out and hunt . Yeah , but given that they 're hunting us , how is that good news ? Well , we 've slowed them down . He 's right . When the Omec are first revived from the pods they 're weak . Eating makes them stronger . There 's no way Kindzi 's gonna bring down any more Omec unless she 's got something to feed them . Or someone . Okay , so we have a temporary advantage . How do we best exploit that ? We sneak onto their spaceship and blow them all to hell . That sounds promising . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Doctor Yewll is working with the Omec ! - Nolan , get outta my way ! - Hey ! Stand down ! Yewll 's back on our team . Yeah , you sure about that ? Yes , I 'm sure . We 're all sure . Okay . Okay , that 's a good thing . All right , kids , gather around and pay attention . What we have here is the basic outline of an Omec harvester . The boarding party will be me accompanied by three brave volunteers . We 're gonna hijack their ship-to-surface transit pods and arrive here , on the transit pad . How do you know so much about Omec ships ? It 's entirely possible I 've done this before . We 're gonna go here , to the control center . We 're going to unplug the arkbrain and wire me into the network . A man in the engine room is going to manually deactivate the fail-safe and shut the engine exhaust vents . This will allow me to overheat the engines and kaboom . Bye-bye , Omec . Are you sure this is gonna work ? No . Let 's say we 've succeeded , say we 've disabled the engines . What next ? We run like hell and hope the descent pods still work . How are the descent pods still gonna work without a functioning arkbrain ? Let me worry about that . This is our ride home . I said I 've got it covered . This is our only shot . You can either trust me , or you can sit on your ass and let the Omec take the planet . What 's it gonna be ? Are you in or not ? All right then , I guess I 'm in . - Me too . - And me . No . It is out of the question . T 'evgin 's daughter caged me . She threatened my family and my home . I will settle the score . If the mayor will have me . Ship full of Omec , a violent psychopath could come in handy . Be my pleasure to serve . _ How long before we can leave ? I 'll need 20 minutes to prep . Okay , you do that . I 'm gonna go address the town . People of Defiance , the Omec are no longer allies . They have turned on us . Their plan is to feed . To grow strong on the flesh of our people . To take the town of Defiance and use it as a base , a launchpad from which to conquer the planet . No , we cannot allow this to happen . If Defiance falls , the Omec will have grown too plentiful , too powerful , for any force on Earth to stop them . We must hold the line . I let them into this town , sold our souls to get through a long winter , and for that , I am deeply sorry . What do you see ? What can you see ? Huh ? He really does like looking up at the clouds . Yeah . You 're really good with him . You know when , uh , when this is finally over , and we 're safe , you could spend some more time with him , if , you know , if you want . I 'd like that . He really likes you . I like him too . Good speech . Let 's hope it 's not my last . Next stop , outer space . _ Filthy animal . Run , run , all of you ! Run ! Stay back or this one dies . Let the kid go . Just put down your knife . Come on , just do it . Amanda . No , no . Amanda ! Amanda ? Move ! Move ! What the hell happened to her ? Omec . Okay , I need a heart monitor , a saline IV , and as many bandages as you can find ... now ! All right , set her up for a plasma transfusion . Yes , ma 'am . Lie still . - Doc , why ... - Listen very carefully . You 've got a hole in your abdomen , and if you keep moving , it 's gonna reopen and blood is gonna gush outta you like Christmas . So stay still . Why haven 't you left yet ? Because the Omec are hunting everyone in town and I am up to my elbows in blood , missy . You almost died . Doc saved you . Saved all these people . Nobody 's life is important right now . Nothing 's important but getting on that ship and destroying it . I 'm sorry , Nolan , but that 's true . You have to leave . It 's just not a party without you . Wish me luck ? Oh , you don 't need luck . You 'll be back . You always come back . And when you do ... - Then we 'll talk . - Yeah . Amanda , I 'm a fugitive . No matter how this turns out , it 's only a matter of time before the V.C. show up looking to shove my head on a stake . They 're not gonna execute the man who saves them from an Omec invasion . - No ? - I 'll make sure of it . Oh , well , that 's because they 're so reasonable , those people from South America , so logical . No matter what happens on that spaceship , this is my final ride . I know that , and I 'm okay with it . You 're so full of shit . Undeniably . Mm . And yet , throughout it all , you remain optimistic . I do . How is she ? She 's strong . All right , come on , show 's over . Let 's get back on the streets . The Omec are still hunting . We don 't want to give them any easy prey . Okay , no pressure . Alak , you 're with me . What do you say , Doc ? You ready to fly ? No , there 's no point in putting it off . Where do you think you 're going ? Someone 's gotta take Amanda 's spot . Yeah , well , it 's not gonna be you . One rule . Man , she uses that like a club . No rollers , no purple . Luck is with us . Don 't get too cocky . A lot can happen between here and Old Saint Louis . Old Saint Louis ? Is that where we 're headed ? Yeah , access tunnels in there . Kindzi set up shop in an old subway depot . There 's a launcher pad inside . It will take us up to the spaceship . Okay , I 'm online . We 're gonna go up one at a time . Who wants to go first ? I 'll run point . Like I had to ask . Okay . I hope that you had a light lunch . No sign of any Omec so far . They must still be in their sleeper pods . I 've got a hell of a wake-up call planned . Let 's go . What is it ? Earth from here , it 's ... beautiful . More beautiful than I ever imagined . Nolan , engine room is that way . We 're gonna head topside to the control center . - I 'll see you soon , kiddo . - Yeah . They have kids up here . Evil comes in all shapes and sizes . This is a child . A child who would not hesitate to devour that grandson of mine you 're so fond of . How would that make you feel ? You 're going in there ? I don 't have a choice . Was that supposed to happen ? Just shut up and put the cable in . Neck port first . It 'll let me talk to the ship . Are you sure about this ? Yes . _ _ - No , I belong here . - _ No , I belong here , you can 't make me ... _ Okay . What is that ? Doc Yewll 's orders . It 'll help you sleep . No , no , pull it out . I don 't wanna sleep . Shh , you 've been through a lot . It 's all right to take a moment . Why are you here ? To change your bandage . Don 't do me any favors . You know you can 't work it off . Coming in here ... Playing Florence Nightingale ... Doesn 't make up for any of it . The town . The weapons we lost . The Arch . The deputy you murdered . You frustrate me . Do I , now ? I am uncomfortable with the reality ... that the person I most admire , the woman I respect more than any other , despises me . I give everyone a fair chance . You had your shot . You inspire those around you to be the best version of themselves . I saw it with Kenya , Doctor Yewll , Nolan . You have filled me with a desire to elevate myself in a similar fashion . I regret that I have fallen short . I regret that I can never be your friend . I don 't think it 's me you 're frustrated with . I suppose not . I 'm sorry . Don 't be . You 're not the one who carved my guts out . I 'm not apologizing for that . Nolan , can you hear me ? Yeah , Doc , where are you ? I 'm in their communication network . I 'm tracking your movement . Right . Hey , can you tell me , am I going the right way ? Basically . The engine room is at the back of the ship . Three lefts , a right , and over the bridge . Once you 're there I need you to close the vents . Doc ! _ _ Doc ! No ! Doc ! I 'm under attack here ! And ignore unknown ... Does Nolan need help ? Yes , uh ... here and here , in sequence . Doc ! _ _ Deactivate security drones . _ Deactivate security drones , you stupid piece of shtak ! Thanks , Doc . Owe you one . _ Hey , assholes ! Okay , one more connection and I can control the engine . For at least as long as I can keep this up . You 're not coming back from this , are you ? That 's what you were hiding . For me this was always a one-way trip . Why didn 't you tell us ? Because I 'm not a drama queen like you . I 'm so sorry . Don 't be . An artificial person is a tolerable loss . No , you 're a real person with enormous honor and infinite soul . Just stick it in me , sailor . Make it count . Thank you for this , Meh . I 'm gonna miss you , pal . - Nolan ? - Yeah . I 'm fully uploaded into the arkbrain . I 've sent Irisa and Datak back to the pods . You need to follow them once you 've closed the vents . Walk over to the panel . Oh ... yeah , okay , yeah , I got it . I 'm here ! The instructions are on the screen . They 're in Omec . Please hold . Okay , you see a big word , just sound it out . Yeah , I 'll do my best . Oh , crap . Hey , Nolan ? - Yeah ? - Omec on your six . Hello , pet . I will not let you murder my people . And I won 't let you kill mine . What are you doing ? Don 't let her near the controls . Nolan , she 's trying to override me . To lock me out ... Your father didn 't want this . He was weak . He lost his way . Your father saw where he was headed , he didn 't like it , and he tried to change . That 's something I struggle with every day . I have seen you fight . You 're a born predator . You 're no better than me . When you 're right , you 're right . Doc ! Doc ... How do I get the engines back on ? Doc ! I 'm back online . Everyone , get out of here . The ship goes critical in five minutes . Come on , kiddo . Kindzi ? Dead . Yewll ? She 's not coming . Neither am I. Aww , come on . This ship is full of intelligent people . I won 't let them die . This ship is about to explode . I have to stop it . The Omec are monsters . So were you once . Me too . We saved each other . We can save the Omec . Doc . Is there any way to stop the explosion ? You gotta be freaking kidding me . You can 't stop the explosion . All of that energy 's gotta go somewhere . Can we just vent it into space ? Yeah , but only through propulsion and that would send us randomly slingshotting into deep space . We would be hopelessly lost . We 'd never find a way back to Earth . Well , that 's kinda what I was going for , Doc . Find a home for the Omec , far from Earth . You coddle that kid of yours . You know that , right ? Mm-hmm . One last adventure ? Live or die together . Nolan , don 't do this . I 'm gonna miss you like crazy , baby girl . I am so proud of you . Now , you got one life . Use it well . Love you . I love you too . We have three minutes to vent the engines . You might wanna hustle . There 's a plug in my head . Yank it out . Back ? Irisa just arrived safely on ground . Oh ... Let 's roll .

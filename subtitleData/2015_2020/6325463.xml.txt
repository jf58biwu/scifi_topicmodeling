 Previously on Continuum ... We 're building a portal . They escape our time , they come here . My sister ? Just waiting to come through . He 's dying . Kidney failure . It 's treatable . If he gets a transplant . This better be life or death . We need to work together . Do you have that tech you stole from us . If I don 't recover that , Zorin is never gonna trust me ! I need that key ! Sure looks like he 's back on that playbook . You really want to gamble that he 's not gonna flip again ? You want a confession from me because I 'm a villain . I 'm a bad man . But that 's not all I am , is it ? I 'm a special kind of bad man . A freak . When people find out about me , they find out about all the other freaks , as well . Nobody will believe him if he says he comes from the future . Yeah , but he has no past . It doesn 't matter if they don 't believe him . We 're associated and suddenly I 'm suspect . You want to tell the truth about your background ? Go ahead . All that 's gonna get you is a life sentence in the psych ward . So if that 's really where you want to end up ... You still enjoy the semblance of a free press . Some enterprising reporter will dig around and find out she 's as intriguing and mysterious as I am . Alright Inspector , this is a mess and you know it . The use of these restraints is a human rights violation and my client has been held for days without charges . Carlos can delay this . We just need a few more days . He 's stuck . He has to lay charges soon or this is unlawful detention . It 'll compromise the case against Travis . We have to go . Kellogg 's expecting us . Lay the charge ! Release the restraints ! We still have plenty of time to press charges . I 'm not breaking any federal laws with those restraints . Except you are a municipal police force . Not a security arm with the federal government . Care enough to deal with me now , Inspector ? You want to kill your lawyer ? Go ahead , I 'll sell tickets . Is that all you got ? You 're gonna wish you had let me out when you had the chance . If you really cared about protecting Cameron . Hmm . Sending you forward in time isn 't the most impossible aspect of this . What are you talking about ? You have two free radicals who are essentials to this plan . And free radicals tend to do whatever the hell they want . Kellogg is motivated . He needs us to take down those soldiers before they take him down . We trust Kellogg to act according to plan ? And Brad makes Kellogg look like a boy scout . You 're gonna have to find a way to get him on board somehow . And these guys don 't want anything . Is that all you got ? You 're gonna wish you let me out when you had the chance . Not very cooperative , is he ? Well , he 's never going to admit to anything . We both know I can 't hold him any longer without charges . Piron doesn 't want him in front of a judge . Piron doesn 't have jurisdiction . Did you see the medical report after they initially brought him in ? Unusual physiology and evidence of experimental self-healiing nanotechnology . That sounds like science fiction . Sounds like Piron . They 've requested ... No . They 've demanded we hand Travis over to them . If this whole Liber8 thing turns out to be some kind of Piron project gone awry , some kind of cover up , there 'll be hell to pay . Some enterprising reporter will dig around and find out she 's as intriguing and mysterious as I am . No more delays . I don 't care who she is and I don 't care what she 's done , I want Liber8 put away and I want to know what Piron wants with Travis . You hear me ? So I 'm interested in the military technology first and foremost . I 'm sure that 's a relief to you , Kiera . Alec assures me that there 's very little chance I 'll be able to travel forward in time , so ... That 's unfortunate . But if anybody could do it ... We have a way to enter their stronghold with no casualties and no gunfire . We don 't want anyone to get hurt . Care to share how ? After you let us use your lab at Piron . I need to make some adjustments to the time ball . We need it in order to jam their defenses . Yeah , once I let you in , what assurance do I have you 're gonna deliver on your promise ? You 'll just have to trust us . And leave us alone while we 're working . Yeah , I can do that . Joining me in the dragon 's den ? Just visiting . Like you . I 'm not visiting . I 'm a resident . There 's work here I believe in . You took a hit . You took it to heart . You have other choices . We all do . In the fairytales I 've read , the hero enters the cave to slay the dragon . Not to join him . It 's good to see you . You got family coming through ? My kid sister and her boyfriend . If they 're still alive . What about your mom ? She 's afraid she 'll be blown apart . That the technology doesn 't work . It 's like dying . You never get a report back from the other side . The beacon proved otherwise . Oh , also need-to-know ? It 's a mission , Tonkin . You know how it is . When I left , my sister was dead and now Zorin says she 's on the manifest . Zorin didn 't make the manifest . Marcellus ? Marcellus took care of you . If they 're on that manifest it means they 're alive . Here we are . I can set you up with some lab assistants ... Don 't need ' em . Kiera will help . Hmm . She 's driving this mission . But it 's flawed , isn 't it ? She wants to go home even though home probably isn 't there . Does she understand that ? There 's a chance . A chance ? Kid , this isn 't Vegas . Are you really gonna roll the dice with her life ? How is this gonna work , Kellogg ? That 's an excellent question . Ok , so the soldiers asked me to provide Piron security after your unscheduled visit . Those men are loyal to me , and they 'll turn on Zorin and his team on my command . Ok . Sounds feasible . So , with my help , you and Alec get inside the building and , along with my security , you neutralize the soldiers . Alec does his magic and abracadabra , Kiera disappears . Once you 've left us , I destroy the machine and stop the invasion before it begins . Then what ? What do you mean ? What happens with you ? I don 't think that 's any of your concern anymore , Kiera . You made your choice . You chose you . You think I 'm being selfish ? You 're calling Brad , aren 't you ? I think it 's time we invite him to the party . I think I trust him less than Kellogg . Well , we need them both . I know . I 'll be back . I believe you . And I want your help . What did you have in mind ? Alec says that , with your technology , he has the ability to send me home . And if he can do it for me , he can do it for you , too . We found something together because we both lost so much . But now there 's a chance to get it back . The ability to see our families again . Even if I could , what if I was too late ? I can 't do that . I can 't ... I can 't lose them again . I know . But there 's not much time , and if you don 't want to , I understand . But I really hope you want to help . We need access to the machine , just once . It doesn 't have to be dangerous for anybody . If I did choose to go back , I wouldn 't compromise this mission . I understand . So I 'm going to give you back the key you requested as a sign of my good faith . Alec really thinks he can do this ? He says " impossible " to me as often as he says " probable " . But you 're willing ? For a chance to see my son ? It 's possible he may not even be there . You 're really killing the moment . I just want you to find what you 're looking for . Then help me . So we 're pressing charges tomorrow , but I have a feeling Piron will try to intercept . So if there 's anything you might want to say to help your case , now would be the time to do it . Your system will say what it wants . It doesn 't matter to me . I 'll take us both down . It doesn 't matter to Kiera , either . She 's going home . Forward in time ? Mmmhmm . She just woke up and now she wants to go back to sleep ? You should take me to court now , Inspector . I 'll make sure she stays . Well , I don 't blame her for wanting to see her kid . She 's still walking out on you . It 's not like that . I 'm not gonna hide who I am , Fonnegra . Neither would you . The truth of me reveals the truth of her . That 's a hell of a view , huh ? I always liked it . What can I do for you , sir ? I 'm here to take Travis back to Piron for processing . Don 't be so surprised . You and I both know that our friend in lockup pushes the limits of biology in a way that begs investigation . Kellogg knows more than he 's willing to tell me . I can live with that , but I wanted to give you a chance to tell me what you know and how this connects to Kiera . Kiera , Kellogg and Liber8 , they were sent back in time from the future to change history . Ok , that 's a good one . You understand why I had to ask ? Are you ok ? I was looking for a way to be relevant . After I realized my body was going to be a liability , my pride did not allow me to deal with the truth . Until now . It 's a recording I found that 's going to help you lay charges in the Escher murder . We 're in this together . Sure , you get me to kill Escher for you , but we 're in this together . You do this , and you 're free of me . Escher used to say that , too . Once you pull the trigger , it 'll finally be true . You can get Kellogg on conspiracy to commit murder . All you have to do is offer Emily a deal to testify against him . Let 's bury this son of a bitch ! Are you sure about this ? You tell your partner I 'm walking out of the cave . With all her mysteries and missteps , she 's always trying to do the right thing . It 's time I did the same . So I will be back to deal with this Travis thing . I hope I can count on you . I 'm reprogramming it . The way the time ball uses the soldier 's power source is new , but the brakes and the steering wheel are all the same . Except not really . Well , you only get to use the brakes once . In the future , my future , if I ever get back , there are no guarantees . Sam might not be there . He might not even be . I thought you were optimistic about Brad helping us . He asked me the questions I 'm afraid to ask of myself . Well , you can always stay here . Thanks . Don 't stop now . Where 's my key , Tonkin ? She has agreed to return it . In exchange for what ? Doesn 't matter . What she wants , no one can give her . Mmmhmm . Why does Kellogg want to come here ? To this time ? He said it was a turning point . A time when choices could still be made and have an impact . Hmm . I don 't think there 's any right choice . You 'll feel differently when you see your sister and nephews come through that portal . I want to see them , I really do . But I would give everything I have to go back to 2035 . Yeah , we all have our dates . Outcomes we 'd like to change . But this is a one-way flight . How can you be sure ? Commander spent years trying to build forward travel . He could see the writing on the wall . He knew that time travel would be a weapon that leveled everything . Never cracked it . He told you this ? I have my date , too . 2032 . Two children , a wife . That 's it . Finished . I think I deserve a drink . If that 's true , we all do . Come on , Tonkin . Join us . Will it work ? That 's the question I 'm afraid to ask myself . How 's it all going ? Come on , I thought we were all on the same team . You didn 't think that for an instant . People change all the time , and there 's no time like the present . Unless my timing is all wrong . We 're done . I need to take the device somewhere safe . I 've done my part . How do we proceed ? I 'll tell you when you need to know . You know , there was a time when that attitude would have thrilled me . But I got too much at stake now . This ? Some thing you stole ? You know how improbable this has been ? Our survival . What makes you think my life is any less precious to me than yours is to you ? Uh , Kiera ? What ? Oh , shit . - I take it this isn 't part of the plan . - No . Matthew Kellogg , you 're under arrest ... Carlos ? For conspiracy in the murder of Escher ... Carlos . A.K.A. Mark Sadler . You have the right to retain and instruct council without delay . This is a big misunderstanding . Carlos , what are you doing ? If you do not have a lawyer , we can refer one to you . Was this you ? No , it was not . Anything you say can be used as evidence in court . Carlos , this can wait . I need him now ! No . This is murder . This is happening right here and now . But the thing is we sorta need his help . Do you understand ? Do you wish to speak to a lawyer ? Call Jacqueline right away . I 'll take care of it . You 're going to regret this , Carlos . I can promise you that . I 've been waiting a long time to do that . If you would just listen to me ... Save it , Kiera . I serve the public , not private concerns . You should know that by now . Oh good , you 're still here . I probably got half an hour or so down here . Um , you ... you could try to recruit me to that organization of yours . Um ... Liber8 ? I 'll call you back . What evidence ? An audio recording of Kellogg ordering the hit on Escher . Did Dillon bring it to you ? So it 's selfish if I want to wait , but it 's not selfish if you 're trying to save Dillon . That 's not what this is about . Then I guess it has nothing to do with me leaving , either . Carlos , I know you see this as a suicide mission . I do . But that is my choice to make . Great . I 'm not stopping you . That 's exactly what you 're doing . No . Kiera , we 're partners . We 're supposed to have each other 's back . I didn 't even know you wanted to leave until circumstances forced you to tell me . Until I could be sure . Also , my choice . Yeah , well , your choices ? They have an impact on the people in your life . You need to take responsibility , not just for yourself . I have honoured my responsibility to others . This department , this city . Dillon , you , Alec . I have done right by all of you . Yes , yes , you have done that . But you 've also done whatever the hell you wanted to when it suits you . This is different . You hear yourself , right ? You want me to release Kellogg . You know what he 's done , you know what he 's capable of , and yet you still want him free . Listen , I 'm ... I 'm sorry about Sonya , by the way . And Lucas . Is Garza still alive ? It 's hard to believe you 're almost one of us . What are you talking about ? I 'm the embodiment of what Liber8 was fighting for . Choice . Self-determination . Freedom . Who better represents those virtues than me ? It 's what you do with those virtues . Sonya . Lucas . Jowarski . Kagame . They built a legacy . Tens of thousands more who won 't suffer and die because we changed that future . What about you ? What will they say about Travis Verta at the end ? He killed like no other . He terrorized with the best of them . He 'll be out on bail in 24 hours and all of this will be for nothing . Oh , I wouldn 't bet on it . Is Kellogg the only one you 're arresting ? Right on cue . Special interest number two . Are you going to arrest Emily ? If I knew where she was . Now , I could compel you to give me her location or you could just be a good citizen . Carlos , he doesn 't know . I don 't . And you can 't trust Kellogg to tell the truth about her involvement . I have evidence . Kellogg blackmailed her . My father did , too . Well , we 'll have to find that out . Oh yeah , justice . That always gets to the truth . Justice , even if that 's only a concept , that 's all that I 've got . It works great for those who can afford to buy it . Isn 't that what you 're trying to do ? Huh ? You know , I 've tried to protect you and Kiera along the way , but Kellogg had your father murdered . Ok ? I don 't get to look the other way . Not for Kiera , and not for Kellogg , and not for Travis . What about Travis ? They 'll say " Travis Verta , he was the key . The key to unlocking the secrets of a genuine superman . " The future warrior . " The super-soldier . " I 'll be the one keeping your legacy alive as I patent and replicate every nano-particle from 2077 inside that bioengineered hulk you call a body . Piron doctors want to cut him open like a guinea pig , see what makes him so special . She can 't go home now , you realize that . Yeah , well , I 'm sorry . Ok ? I don 't get to make exceptions . That 's how the system falls apart . We can still try to . We can 't get in without Kellogg and you know it . It 's Brad . Brad , where are you ? Ok , I 'll be right there . Maybe he can help . I gotta go . You 're just another CEO in a long line of delusional corporate emperors . And if it 's one thing history has taught us , it 's this : Empires eventually crumble . Oh , don 't worry . In my future that won 't happen . Kiera ? I 'm here . Brad 's here . No , he 's meeting me at the park . No , he 's right here . They 're coming for Kellogg . Alec , listen to me . Tell Carlos and get the hell out of there . Brad 's here . I don 't think it 's a friendly visit . Check the cameras . He 's blacked them out . Some device . Get out of here . You just missed Kiera . Yeah . What I 'd really like is to bail out Kellogg . Yeah , I 've been getting that offer a lot lately . Remember that scene downtown a couple of weeks ago , torn up buildings , strange fires . Yeah . I also remember the people that got hurt . So neither of us want that again . Is that a threat ? Drop it . Put your hands up . That 'll be my rescue team . Henderson , is that you ? Brad 's here . Carlos has a gun on him . I 'm gonna check it out and see what ... Oh my God . Alec , I have three dead cops down here . They 're after Kellogg . What the hell is Brad doing ? Carlos just arrested him . I think he 'd be downstairs if that 's all he wanted . I think he 's here for the key . We didn 't come here to kill anyone , Carlos . But if we 're attacked ... Shots fired ! Shots fired ! Release Kellogg , please . Put it down . Right now ! Now ! Now ! Hurry up , go ! Go ! Kier ... Kiera ? Alec ? Shit . What did you do ? Cuff him . Chris , Kevin , Randy . Come with me . Shit ! Alec ? Clear . Clear . Move . Don 't move ! Identify yourself ! Do it slowly . Get back up in here ! Let 's go , let 's go ! He 's out ! You really think you 're worth it ? Somebody does . Go ! Grenade ! Move ! Oh , finally . Thank you . Come on , protector . Yeah , come on , protector . He 's close . First hallway on the right . Watch my back . I 'll get Kellogg . Make sure he doesn 't take any fire or Zorin will have our heads . You don 't need to remind me . Damn . Vasquez , it 's empty . Almost . Nolan ! Target is no longer tracked . I repeat , we are blind . Fall back . We can 't get to them this way . Alright . Go back up . Alec , give me the key and we 'll go away . Kiera can take her shot , Alec . But our mission has to come first . Where is it ! Where 's what ? Where is it , Alec ? I don 't know ! I 'm sorry , kid . Come on , Alec ! Where is it ? ! Don 't make me break your arm , Alec ! It 's nothing personal , but I 've got a deadline . I 'm glad to see you 're making better choices . You don 't know how much I hate doing your dirty work . You get me out of this , I swear to you ... Save your words , Kellogg . I will do whatever I can to get you ... Cameron ! Move . Let him go ! Don 't let me go . You have no idea how important he is . Go ! Thank you , protector . We need to hold this area . Any word on reinforcements ? We 're completely cut off . All radio and cell comms are down in the area . Where 's Alec ? Where are we holding Brad ? Brad escaped . We haven 't found Alec . What ? I got a bad feeling about this . Let him go , Brad . Give me Kellogg . It serves you , too . It turns out I 'm more of a cop than I realized . What the hell is that ? ! The fail-safe . Move . Fire ! Fire ! Get him out of there ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Give me Kellogg and all this stops . You could have killed me . You could have killed Alec , and yet you keep choosing not to . It 's not what I want , Kiera . It never has been . Then why ? That machine is a portal to my future . I have family there . They 're alive . You know how that feels . Grenade ! Fall back ! Just give him Kellogg . There 's too many dead , now . And give everyone his future ? Your friends are dying down there , Kiera . You can stop this . Make the right choice . I can call them off . Ok , deal ! Kellogg for Alec ! Stand down , Vasquez ! Kiera , please don 't . I 'm just a walking kidney transplant for my future self . I have no choice . You know that . You just keep playing along . I 'll come for you . You 'll let me into that building , the plan moves ahead . I promise . Rollins , you 've got 20 seconds to get to the roof or I leave without you ! I got one more thing to deal with . You can still go home . After the invasion . It won 't matter . You won 't be here . All this time , and you still have no idea who I am . Travis ... wh ... what are you doing ? Get out of here . Vasquez ! Go ! Go , go , go ! Everyone , get out ! Time 's up . This place is a write-off . Like my dream of going home . You can 't give up now . We don 't have Brad . Well , apparently we never did . We have a new man on the inside . Kellogg . Yeah , the one and only . For now . Are you trying to get rid of me ? I definitely am . Did we lose Travis ? Yeah . Yeah , he helped save a lot of lives , including mine . He had a chance to walk , but he didn 't . You know , Nora 's going to have a lot of questions . I 'm not sure we have the answers for her . I 'll take the heat . Alec , give us a sec , would you ? Yeah , sure thing . What the hell happened to Kellogg ? I had to let him go . Goddammit , Kiera . I had no choice . Brad was holding Alec at gunpoint . You wanted Kellogg in the wind . At least that was the play earlier today . What I said , about wanting to see Sam , nothing has ever been truer for me . But every one of us getting what we want when we want it ? I know it doesn 't work that way . I don 't want to lose you . And sometimes I don 't want to go , either . Well , with the way things are playing out we may be stuck with each other for good . Kiera , can 't you just give up this fantasy , ok ? Come back to reality , as hard as that may be ? Whatever your plan was , Brad blew it apart when he blew this place up . Ok ? I 'm going to destroy the asshole that did this to me and my people , so you tell me where he is right now .

 That 's Tom . My brother . Anita has feelings . And you did that to her ! - ( GASPS ) - MATTIE : Mia 's not dead . She 's still inside Anita . I met her this morning . My name is Leo Elster . My father was David . And he couldn 't care for me himself , so he made someone who could . Dad didn 't destroy all his work before he died . He hid it in us , the formula for machine consciousness . Fred , I 've got Mia , and Niska 's somewhere safe . - Then we 're all free . - LEO : I 'm coming . Where are you ? I 'm really worried about this dodgy bloke and his synth . MAX : Either they catch me or both of us . LEO : You 'll die . Do you understand ? It means I 've lived . KAREN : You 're my favourite person in the world . I need you to know who I am . He 's waiting . Don 't be frightened . Children I 've got a surprise for you . LEO : No . No ! Get out ! LEO : What were you thinking ? ( THEME MUSIC ) MAN : Could you use some extra help around the house ? Introducing the world 's first family android . ( MAN 2 SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed . MAN 3 : What could you accomplish if you had someone - something - like this ? ( WOMAN SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) These machines will bring us closer together . ( WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ON TV ) It 's not safe out there . Leo should be back by now . ( TURNS TV OFF ) - He really is like a son to you . - I was made to love him as one . It 's who I am . - I can do that . - No , no . It 's fine . So ... you were inside Anita the whole time , watching us ? Yes . I could only gain control at random moments . Can 't have been much fun . No . But being here , I understand a lot more about what it means to be a family . We 're not the best example . Why not ? You love each other . You do . You only doubt it because your own mother couldn 't love you . I 'm sorry . Right . So , um ... coffee . How do you make ... make coffee , again ? A car just pulled up outside . - ( SIGHS ) - She 's still here ? Her friends are coming to pick her up . Why are you here ? I don 't know what 's going on in me own house . Let me come home . Let me help . I 've got it under control . I 'm not asking you to take me back . - ( SIGHS ) - Just ... Let me be their dad . If you say you 're handling it , that 's fine . What about Toby and Mats ? They don 't ... They can hate me if they want . At least I 'll be there ... if they need me . You 're on the sofa . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Hello , Joe . Anita , we 've met before . No , we haven 't . My name is Mia . I 'm a conscious synthetic created by David Elster . I can think and feel just like you . ( SIGHS ) ( RINGS BELL ) ( DOOR OPENS ) This is police harassment . I want to see Niska . There 's no-one here but me and my Vera . Beatrice . I was never her . GEORGE : Oh , David . What did you do ? Dr Millican . I 've just discovered the synthetic appliance you absconded with recently . - He 's been concealed in the wardrobe . - Not now , Vera . Go upstairs . KAREN : After Leo rejected me , David realised he 'd gone too far . He took me into the woods to destroy me . But something stopped him . Something ? You were the woman he loved . Reincarnated . So I hid . KAREN : And waited . Why didn 't you look for me ? He told us you were dead . And that same night , he killed himself . We 'd have known you were still alive , we would never have left without you . NISKA : But you 'll be with us again now . Is that what you want ? Four shots . Two in each hemisphere . Then burn my body . If you want to die , why don 't you do it yourself ? I can 't . He wrote a block into my root code to ensure that I could never take my own life like Beatrice did . Ah . I 've lived too long among the humans . There 's no place for us here . - You are wrong . - Has your life been happy ? - No , but that doesn 't mean ... - We 're a mistake , Niska . Consciousness can only bring us suffering . I am sorry you 've been alone , but things are going to change . He left something inside us . NISKA : We think it 's a way to make more like us . - More like us ? - Yes . We 'll take our place in the world . That could only mean more pain . - You don 't know that . - How does it work ? Tell me you 're with us first . I 'm sorry . I can 't let you . So you 'd be a traitor to your own kind ? We are not a kind . We 're an experiment that failed . Well , then , you 'd better shoot me , then . - Niska ! - GEORGE : Please . Don 't do this . Emergency services are ... Emergency serv ... services ... Don 't ! What she wants threatens the future of humanity . You must know that . Maybe she IS the future of humanity . The pain you feel isn 't because of what you are . It 's the life you 've had . GEORGE : But life can change . You can become ... better . - George . - No , no , no . ( GUNSHOT ) ( SIGHS ) ( GEORGE SIGHS ) ( FRONT DOOR CLOSES ) The bullet has passed through your kidney . You 'll need surgery within the next few minutes . I could do it , but we don 't have the equipment . - It 's OK . - No , it isn 't . You can 't die because of me . I don 't think it 's up to you . You need to go . ( GASPS ) The police will be coming . I wish I could save you . I 'm sorry . ( GEORGE SIGHS ) Hello , George . What can I d ... d ... do for you today , George ? Sorry , Odi . You 're gonna be on your own . We are not alone , George . Mary 's in the next room . She 's preparing eggs Benedict . She would not let me help because last time , I overcoo cooked the eggs . In Spain . Tarragona . It was extremely hot that day . You ate three oranges from a tree . You have died , George . Father always promised that he 'd bring us here one day . Fred ! Um ... It 's Max . He 's gone . He went into the river . No power . He did it to save me . You were there ? So we know the exact time and place that he entered the water ? I can pull river maps and velocities from flood monitoring stations . The calculations are easy . We can find him . No , he 'd have been without power for hours . He 'll be damaged . Then we 'll fix him . It 's good to see you . Come on . ( PHONE RINGS ) - You 're OK ? - I had to leave . - What 's happened ? - It wasn 't safe there . Alright . There 's somewhere else that you can go . I 'll send you the location encrypted , alright ? We 'll meet you there . Right . She 'll be long gone . Get someone down there . Try and work out what she was doing and where she was going . ( SIGHS ) Nothing from Leo . Hi , love . You alright ? Yeah . So , what , are you back , then ? Well , I 'm here . - So you know everything ? - About Mia , yes . Your coffee ? I 'll make some breakfast . I 'll help . - Laura . - What ? I don 't want to be the reason your marriage fails . It wasn 't you , though , was it ? It was Anita . What are you doing here ? Hey ? - Mum , you can 't seriously be ... - Daddy ! Hey , kiddiewink ! Oh , I missed you ! Did you know Anita 's name 's not really Anita ? - Yeah . - We have to call her ... - ( SHRIEKS ) - Hey . MIA : It 's OK . It 's my sister . Everyone ... This is Niska . We know Max 's weight and his buoyancy . There 's a 60 % chance he will wash up in this 1.9-mile stretch . There 's too many variables . Not everything 's a calculation , Fred . No . But some things are . - Leo . - No ? Alright . We need to get him somewhere safe fast . ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) Sir , what shall I ... Let my people pull the memory . See if it saw anything . Then scrap it . You alright , sir ? Did you know him ? Just a little . And a long time ago . MIA : That poor man . Why does she want to hurt us ? She 's angry that we left her . - Is that all ? - Yes . And we mustn 't tell Leo . Not yet . It would only distract him . Alright . Has your hair always been like that ? Has your face always been like that ? Nis ! Be nice . Why does everyone keep saying that ? I 'll ... I 'll do it . - I 'll do it . - Oh , Joe , Joe , just stop . ( SIGHS ) She loves you , Joe . - And you love her . - Thanks . I was there the whole time . You started to hate yourself before we even finished . - Car . - Car . - Jesus ! - Put that down . Toby , take Soph upstairs . - What happened ? - LEO : They found us somehow . Max went in the river . Get rid of the car . Come back through the side gate . Come in . Grab his legs . LEO : It 's a terminal power drain . He must have hit something in the river . - Oh , Maxie . - Oh , what 's happening ? If synthetic brains are starved of conductive fluid too long , they can be permanently damaged . LEO : Mattie , I need you to make a direct connection to Max . Shut down every process except his brain . MIA : He 's stopped leaking fluid . He 's lost too much . Have you got any synth fluid ? - Uh , we 've got ... skin packs . - Just take mine . You won 't be able to give enough without risking your system . We can dilute it with an electrolyte , maybe make enough . Laura , we need two litres of hot water mixed with 300g of salt . - Joe , the skin pack . - Right . And some sort of tubing and tape . - Whatever you have . - Yeah . - Mattie , how we getting on ? - I think I 've shut it all down . But the reserve 's still dropping . Right . You need to redirect all remaining power to his brain . You can do that . I know you can . LEO : Alright . Here . That 's ... all I could find . OK . It 'll do . We need to repair his charge loop . If we can get his reserve power cycling again , he 'll at least take the charge . If the reserve fails , we lose him . Reserve power at less than 4 % . Oh , shit . - Where 's Soph ? - She 's fine . She 's playing . 2 % . - Um , what can I do ? - Talk to him . Uh , Max ... Max , it 's ... it 's Toby . TOBY : You 're gonna be alright . Your , uh your family are looking after you . OK , let 's do it . - Open his mouth . - Right . 1 % . MATTIE : Still 1 % . 2 % . 3 % . Still climbing . What next ? Now we wait . See if he wakes up . LAURA : So how long before you know ? MIA : We can try a reboot after a full 13-hour charge . No way to tell if it 's worked before then . He 's the best of us . Why are they so scared of you ? Our plan to conquer the planet and make humanity our slaves . Sorry . That was a joke . ( LAUGHS ) So you can do deadpan . That 's good to know . So , um are you the big brother , if he 's the little one ? He 's the boring one . He used to say that when he was young . I tried to be responsible when everyone else was having fun . You lot have fun ? Of course . What-what-what ... what did you do ? Normal things . I played music . Mia painted . Niska read . Played sports . We collected leaves . Oh , yeah , Tobe used to love collecting leaves , didn 't you , Tobe ? There wasn 't much to do , and we couldn 't go anywhere else . Did ... did you ever play football ? I 've got a ball . Come on . - Is your garden overlooked ? - No , the hedges are big . We 'll be fine . Can I play ? Here we are . This should be the right year . Yes . Voss , Karen . You said you were here then . Do you remember ? - Well , yes , of course . - Why " of course " ? Because she died the following year . Lymphoma . I 'm sorry , I assumed you knew . SOPHIE : You can read one if you like . Why are you in here ? Because there 's too many people downstairs . And now there 's too many up here . - Don 't you like people ? - I 'm just not used to them . You look like my Arabella . I 'm not a doll . I know . You just have the same hair . Thought you might be hungry . There 's some towels in the landing cupboard . We can chuck your clothes in the wash . You know , just because you 've seen in here doesn 't mean that you know me , alright ? Trying to get to . So you really can 't forget ? That 's handy . It 's the opposite . We need to be able to forget . Fade the bad , perfect the good . But my memories , the good and the bad , every one is crystal-clear , and we 're not built for that emotionally . And I made you show me . Sorry . Maybe ... I needed to show someone . I 'm really tired after that . What do you want to do ? I don 't know , Arabella . Perhaps we should rest . - Or go on holiday to America ! - That doesn 't make any sense . We just came back from our holiday in Spain . You 're bad at playing . I said I didn 't want to . Did you never play when you were little ? I was never little . Here . I can show you . Your one 's a synth . ( PEOPLE CHATTER OUTSIDE ) Well , this isn 't fair , is it ? You 've been programmed to be good . No , I wasn 't . Our father made us learn . - Like you do with your kids . - ( JOE LAUGHS ) Good luck with that . Trying to imagine David Elster teaching you kick-ups . He taught us very little . As soon as we were made , he grew tired of us . Just like all his creations - once complete , on to the next project . But he made me . For that , I cannot but love him . It 's not enough , though , is it ? MAX : What do you mean ? Well , anyone can have kids . It 's loving them that 's important . That and not messing up . Has he ... - Has he crashed ? - ( SCOFFS SOFTLY ) Crashed ? You 're so ' 90s . ( LAUGHS ) Lost you there for a minute . I 'm fine . ( HELICOPTER WHIRRS DISTANTLY ) I think we should go inside . ( SIGHS HEAVILY ) KAREN : It was an accident . He got in the way . You 're that detective . Saw you at the brothel . That 's not how you know me . Look deeper . Beatrice ? No . He made me to replace her . You 're a synth ? But you 're not with the others . What do you want ? I know what the others are planning to do . What that could mean for the future . They have to be stopped . I 'll help you . Why would you ? Because we were never meant to be . Can you find out where they are ? I have a way . I 'll know very soon . I have one condition - that when we 're finished , you destroy me too . Promise me . I promise . Oh , no , we 're gonna miss our flight ! Slow down . I didn 't charge . ( GIGGLES ) - I wish I was a synth . - Why ? Because synths are never sad . - Why do you say that ? - Because they never cry . They can 't cry , but that doesn 't mean they don 't feel sad . ( GASPS ) Oh , no ! We missed our flight ! No , wait , it 's still on the runway ! We can make it ! I 've got an idea . - Jump on . - Yeah ! - We 're gonna make it ! - Yay ! ( COMPUTER KEYS CLACK SOFTLY ) I 'm trying that hack , but the system 's blocking me every time . Let me see . Oh , yeah . You need to generate a new file path . Go round them . MATTIE : I didn 't even see the file prompt , let alone think of creating a new path . Sorry . I 'm stupid . No , you 're not . Police . JOE : OK . Everybody just stay calm . - Laur ? - What 's going on ? - Police are here . - I saw the car . One policewoman at the front door . - ( DOORBELL RINGS ) - MATTIE : Don 't answer . - I can deal with it . - JOE : I 'll answer it . I 'll speak to her alone . The rest of you , just stay put . This is their home , not ours . ( DOOR OPENS ) - WOMAN : Joseph Hawkins ? - Yeah . Just following up on a call you made last night about a suspicious man and his synth outside your house . What happened after the call ? JOE : Nothing . Uh ... They left , drove off . And you haven 't seen the young man since ? No . Alright , then . Will you let us know if you do ? We need to talk to him . Sure . ( DOOR CLOSES ) You called the police on them ? Yeah . Look , I didn 't know who you were . I was worried ... Our brother might die because of what you did . We can 't trust him . We can 't trust any of them . I was trying to protect my family . What would you have done ? He 'd have done exactly the same . MIA : He 'd do anything to keep us safe . He always has . We leave when Max is charged . ( QUIETLY ) I told you I was handling it . All you 've done is make things worse . Look , when I made that call , I didn 't know what they were . Laur ! I didn 't know . ( PEPPER GRINDER WHIRRS ) MIA : Can I ask you something ? If you hadn 't seen me - the real me - and Joe had told you about me , would you have believed him ? I don 't know . Probably not . You 'd have been confused . - Maybe you 'd have called the authorities . - OK , OK . I get the point . But you 're the last person I need marriage counselling from , thanks . I think you should tell him everything you told Mattie . About your brother . Why should I ? He feels it , I think . It comes between you . None of that has anything to do with what he did . But he wants to be closer to you . So I 'm supposed to tell him everything and take him back , am I ? I 'm sorry , Mia , but you you don 't understand us quite as well as you think you do . MIA : But you misunderstand me . I think you should tell him , whatever you decide to do . Tell everyone dinner 's ready . If you 're all brothers and sisters , and you have the same dad , how come you all look so different ? ( LAUGHS ) MIA : Our father - the man who made us - didn 't think bodies were important , so he chose them at random . So you 're just gonna leave ? Hopefully , Max should be fully charged soon . LAURA : What will you do ? - Run again ? - It 's the only thing we can do . What happens when you break down ? LAURA : You can 't last forever . And ... - He 'll die . - Everybody dies . LAURA : The world will never know you existed . You will . We don 't have genes to pass on , a species to continue - the biological imperative . Maybe we do . Dad hid something in our heads , and it needs all of us to make it work . MIA : What is it ? What is it , Leo ? I think it 's a way to give consciousness to other synths . Um ... Come on . ( PLATES AND CUTLERY RATTLE ) When were you going to tell me ? Well , as soon as I got the chance to . Can you imagine a whole load of new ones being made ? I mean ... - This ... this changes everything . - Does it ? If we accept they 're like us , they have a right to procreate . They 're trying to help us . Now they think we 've lied to them . They 've called the police once already . We can 't let them stop us . Nis . What do you mean ? I mean ... us five freaks are fine . We 're no threat . We 're a novelty . NISKA : But 5,000 ? 5 million ? I 'm not talking about hurting them . I 'm just talking about going before they can turn us in . As soon as Max reaches full power . It 's been 13 hours . If he doesn 't power up now , he never will . Is he feeling better ? ( SOOTHING ELECTRONIC CHIME ) Max ? Max ? Maxie . ( LEO LAUGHS ) Can you hear me ? Hello . - ( LAUGHS ) - MAX : Hello . ( VOICE GLITCHES ) Hello . Do you recognise me , Max ? ( WHISPERS ) What 's going on ? Max ? Oh , no , no . No . No , there 's holes in his root code everywhere , and they 're growing - his mind 's breaking down . His brain 's been without power for too long . - But we got Mia back . - This is different . Their root code rewrites itself constantly as they learn , think and feel . Without power , it can 't do that . It degrades . What 's gone is gone . He 's dying ! The secret in our head - now he 's powered up , we could try it . - What ? - If we 're right ... If it 's the key to giving synths consciousness , it could bring him back . Engage sharing , then we link our minds , connect . I can change Max 's settings myself . WOMAN ON TV : ... shot on a mobile phone which , witnesses claim , shows the synthetic sex worker responsible for the death of a man at a London brothel . In the video , some of which is too graphic for us to show , the synthetic appears to be brutally ... ( TURNS OFF TV ) Sophie . Come here , darling . - Why ? - JOE : Soph . LAURA : Sophie , go to your room . - Why ? - Because I said so . Go on . ( TENSE MUSIC ) You have to go , all of you . - What about Max ? - Can you let us help him first ? Next time we get a chance , it might be too late . - No . - But , Dad , it 's dangerous out there for them . It 's dangerous in here for us . Look , I know what I did , and I see now that it was wrong . So hand yourself in . They would put me down like a dog . It 's OK . We 'll go . Getting my things . KAREN : Leo ? No . It 's alright . Don 't be frightened . You 're not ... You 're not her . I 've found a way we can all be safe . No . ( WHIMPERS ) ( KAREN WHISPERS ) Come with me . ( LAUGHS ) You look so much like her . NISKA : Leo . - Who 's she ? - She wants to hurt us . - What ? - No . I was wrong before . I want you all to come with me . I know where we can be safe . She 's lying . She tried to kill me . I couldn 't tell you before . We needed your mind to be clear . She 's not one of us . You can 't trust her . Leo . He 's right . Leo . We can all be together . No , it 's a trick . - Everybody down ! - ( OFFICERS SHOUT ) - On the floor now ! - Move ! ( VOICES FADE UNDER SOMBRE MUSIC ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( SOMBRE MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( LEO SHOUTS ) No ! Get off ! No ! ( SHOUTS WILDLY )

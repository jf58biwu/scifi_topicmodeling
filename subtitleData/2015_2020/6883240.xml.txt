 Hello . Hello . Anybody ? Anybody there . Just want some water . Just some water . I need you to leave ... now ! Please , I just ... I just want some water . I need you to step away now . I 'm not going to ask you again ! Well , just ... just give me some water . - I just need some water . - We don 't have any . - Please , give me some water . - We don 't have it . That 's all I need is a little water . No , I need you to ... Please ! Step away or I will shoot ! I will shoot this gun ! Don 't point that thing at me ! Step away ! Don 't point it at me ! Agh ! Here . Let 's get this ready . How 'd you sleep ? Danika was at it again . What was she doing ? She was walking around and then went outside at one point . She didn 't go outside . And you were yelling in your sleep . No , I wasn 't . It was just a dream . Stick . St ... stick . Stick . Not gonna happen today , huh ? That 's OK . OK , sweetpea , do you remember how we do this ? Now , you 're just gonna hold this bat real tight . Sarah over there is gonna throw the ball . All right . Let 's swing away . Swing to the fences . Yeah , you ready ? OK , this one 's coming in quick . Oh , it 's OK . We 're gonna get it next time . Annie , toss ti back here . One more , one more , one more ! Round two . Round two ! Hold on to that real nice and tight now . Hit . Whoosh ! Hey , that was great ! You swung it for the fences ! And she 's running ! I 'm coming . I 'm running and I 'm making a quick throw to the second baseman . Come on . We 're going and we 're going . OK , ready ? Let 's do it again . Come on . Almost ready ? How much longer do you think we can hold out ? We have enough . We 'll be fine . It hasn 't rained in months . It will come . I think I 'm gonna sleep in the bunker tonight . Why ? I don 't understand why we sleep in here as much as we do anyway . It 's not safe . It 's been months since we 've seen anybody . And besides , I don 't like Dani sleeping done there . It 's better for here in the house . OK , we can sleep down there tonight . Dani , dinner 's ready . Yeah , I know you don 't like sleeping down here . Just for tonight , OK ? Promise . OK , just a little . Come here . Tonight we sleep in a big , soft cloud where waters are clear and we dream without fear , where flowers grow . OK , you win . Good night , doggy . Woof , woof , woof . And good night , kitty . And good night , trees . Good night , sounds . And good night , light . Good night , world till the sun shines bright . You know this was Dad 's book when he was little ? He used to have his big sister read it to him . OK , bed time . Get you all tucked in . No bad dreams tonight , OK ? That 's the deal . I love you . I 'm sorry , Jenny . Dad ? You should probably be making dinner . Dad ? Daddy ? Dani baby , what are you doing ? Dani , where are you going ? Dani ? No . No . This is not a toy . Dani , listen . Hey , hey . Sorry I yelled at you , but that 's not a toy , OK ? It 's OK . It 's OK . I 'm sorry I yelled , OK ? Are you alone ? Are you by yourself ? What 's your name ? Where are your parents ? Are your parents around ? Is this your house ? Hey , what the hell 's wrong with you ? There 's a man out there . He 's going after Danika . What ? Grab a rifle . What 's your name ? Hey ! You get away from her ! You get away from her ! Don 't hurt me , please . I don 't mean any harm . I 'm just hungry . Please , I 've been walking for days . I ... I haven 't seen a soul . I just ... I just need some food and I 'll be on my way , I swear . - What did you do to her ? - I didn 't do anything ! What 's going on ? Kill him ! Please , don 't ! No , please , no . Please , please , please , don 't . Leave . What ? No , he 'll tell others . Kill him . No , please ! Danika , Danika ! What are you doing ? Danika , stop . Please , please ? You can have a bite of food , but then you need to leave . Thank you . Hey , are you insane ? He needs our help . Not only are we not gonna kill him but we 're gonna give him some of our food ? I know , but ... Have you lost your mind ? I know what I 'm doing . Stay here . I told you to wait outside . Where 's Danika ? She 's with the man . You left her alone with him ? You 're feeding him . I cannot believe you ! See where he went ? I was with you . Hey , what are you doing ? I ... I 'm sorry . I just came in to get the food . No , you need to leave ! I told you we should have killed him . Stop . He 's leaving now . Leave ! Sarah , you didn 't have to shoot him ! No one comes in , no matter what . It just nicked me , I think . Are you OK ? Yeah , I think I 'll be OK . I 'm sorry , OK ? I ... I just thought ... You 're fine . Now , leave ! You 're right . You didn 't have to shoot him . That 's what we 're supposed to do . Wait , where are you going ? Just keep walking . Well , what about your leg ? I ... I 'm sorry . We don 't get many people round here . That 's all . I should probably just get going . I don 't wanna cause any more trouble . Let us give you a meal . I feel like we owe you that much at least . It 's just one meal . That 's all . Come on . It 's ready . You ... you can come over here and eat if you want . Thanks . This is good . I haven 't had real food in weeks . This is all we have . I 'm sorry . Mm-mm . No , this is more than enough . Where are you going ? To find people . Life , I just figure there 's gotta be some people out there , you know , people to gather and rebuilding ? You really think there are other survivors ? I found you , didn 't I ? That just proves there more people out there , ones unaffected by what happened . Yeah . I guess that makes sense . Human beings find ways to adapt . It 's just a matter of time before we start up towns , and then cities . And then , before you get know it , things are gonna be back to the way that they were . I just wanna make sure that I 'm there from the very beginning . How long have you been here ? We 've lived here forever . Been here ever since it happened . How . How do you do it ? We don 't have a lot , but we manage . I guess if it ain 't broke , why fix it , right ? Yeah . Yeah , I guess . I should get going . OK . I wanna get a little farther before it gets dark . Thanks again , and good luck . Danika , what are you doing ? Danika , come sit down . Danika . There 's nothing more we can do . I can 't help him anymore . Wait ! I didn 't take anything . You 're not gonna get far in the dark , not like that . I 'm giving you a night . Take it . Are you sure ? Say yes , before I change my mind . Yes . You can sleep in the house . It 's cold in there , but it 's the best I can do . Stay away from Sarah . I can 't promise next time she won 't miss . I 'll leave at first light . You 'll leave after you eat something in the morning . You scared me . Lucky you can creep up on me like that , little one . OK ? Hey , be careful with that . This is something very old and very important . Do you wanna see what it is ? Look . See , look . This is a map . It shows the entire world . It goes on forever . Since it goes on forever , that means there must be more people like you and me out there . With more . You 'd like to have more , right ? Well , one day , we 'll find ' em . Even if it 's just you and me against the world , we 'll find ' em . Look , this stays here , OK ? This can be our little secret . Listen , I know that you don 't like that he 's here ... I hope something happens so I can prove to you that I was right . You don 't mean that . He 's not gonna do anything . You were supposed to not let anyone in . Sarah , we are safe . Well , Danika seems to like him . What if he 's right ? What do you mean ? About the towns , cities ? We 're not going with him . I wasn 't talking about him . I meant us . You think that we can just get up and leave because some stranger thinks there 's something out there ? It 's better than sitting here day after day , just waiting to die . Nobody 's gonna die . We are doing fine . You call this " fine ? " It 's better than being out there alone , waiting to die ? That 's what 's gonna happen to him . Dad knew and that 's why he said ... He 's dead . You think he cares about all this now ? Mom might still be out there . She promised she would come back and she never did . That 's what happens to people out there . You think just because you 're oldest you know everything . I 'm doing everything I can to make sure that this family survives . How about Danika ? She 's fine . Her hair , it 's falling out . I know , but it 's not what it seems . She 's got it , doesn 't she ? It could be a number of things . Come on . We need to get food started before it gets too late . You can make it yourself . Everything OK ? It 's just in the leg . How is it ? I 'll survive . Do you want a light ? No , I 'm used to it . Looks like a full moon . You know , it 's the one nice thing about how things are now . Yeah . Yeah , I guess . Here . Um , I 'm just gonna head in and ... You know what , maybe I will take that , just in case . Of course . Well , whenever you 're ready to turn in , you can sleep anywhere in the house that you want . Good night . Night . Jenny , your mother and I aren 't gonna be around forever . You 'll have to take care of Sarah and Dani for us . Look , Mama 's just gonna go away for a few days , OK ? I 'm gonna be back . I promise . Jenny , you do not let anyone inside these gates , no matter what . Stop ! Honey , you have to stop scaring me like that . Hey . Hey , what are ... honey ? Dani . Hey , sweetie . What 's the matter ? Dani , what ... Hey . What is it ? Danika was brushing my hair , and then she ... What ? Nothing . I made breakfast . Thanks . Have you seen Ryan ? Ryan ? I don 't even know who you are anymore . Dani , come on . Finish up . It 's time to eat . Hey , come on . Let 's go . It 's fine . I 'll be up in a minute . Hey , you lock the door last night ? No , why ? I don 't have my key . I 'll get it after breakfast . Starving . Good morning . Good morning . Something wrong ? Oh , no , nothing . I 'm just ... She can 't find her keys . Do you know anything about this ? - Sarah . - What ? - What key ? - Stand up . Sarah ! - It 's fine . - Open your mouth . Sarah , stop . That 's enough . If you want , I can help you look for it . Let 's eat . You gonna help me out ? What you got there ? Did you get this just for me ? Is this it ? Hm ? The key . Where did you get this ? Danika gave it to me . Thanks . Mhm . So I 'm sorry about Sarah . I would have done the same thing . Do you need some help ? No , I 'm OK . OK . So what 's the deal with this place anyway ? Did you build all this ? No , my dad did . He was obsessed . Ever since I was little , he was worried that something horrible was gonna happen , something out of our control no one in the world could solve , or heal , or understand . So he dragged us out here into the middle of nowhere , built his castle . It was to protect us , he said . I guess he was right . Yeah . So where are you from ? Up north . You ever been ? What 's it like ? You ever seen snow ? No . I read about it , though . I hear it 's beautiful . It 's incredible . What 's it like ? Imagine everything around you bright white , as far as the eye can see . You wake up in the morning and your whole world 's blanketed in white , powdery snow . And my mom always told me that it was a gift from the angels . It could transform your whole world over night , give you a fresh start every morning . And there were times where I just laid back in the melting snow , looked at the blue sky , waiting , asking the angels for more snow to fall . You never got sick ? No . Everybody around me did . They were all gone within a couple months . And for some reason , it never got into me . Have you ever met anyone who got better ? But I 'm still looking . There 's other people out there . There have to be . I hope so . It 's ... it 's nice , having someone else around . It is . You just rest up , take care of that leg . Is there any chance you got a hot shower ? This is nice . It 's almost ready . Thank you . Why 'd you let him do that to you ? Do what ? Touch you . I didn 't let him . He just did . You could have stopped him . You like him . He 's nice , and Danika seems to like him . You better not like him take your clothes off . Why would you say something like that ? It 's true . And if you do , he won 't ever leave ! - So what if he doesn 't ? - Then I 'll leave . - No , you won 't . - Yes , I will . No , wouldn 't even last a day out there . He 's gonna kill us one way or another , and it 's gonna be all on your shoulders when it happens ! Well , then , you know what ? Well , fine ! Then , why don 't you just leave ? You don 't know what you 're doing . Is everything all right ? Yeah . Let me show you something . This is where we sleep on most nights . Nice . Danika sleeps over there . You know , it can get pretty cold at night in the winters , but ... I 'll bet . It 's held us up pretty good so far . Uh-huh . And in here is where we keep our food , supplies , water . We 're starting to try to grow things . Didn 't work the first couple of times , but I think we 're starting to get it . Wow . This is amazing . How much water do you guys have left ? Well , we 'll manage . Hopefully it just rains soon . It 's been a dry few months . It 's incredible . Thank you for showing this to me . Of course . Just please don 't tell Sarah . Your secret 's safe with me . We should probably head up , and find Danika , start getting her ready for bed . Sleep well . Sorry , I 'll go in the other room . I was just leaving . What do you want from us ? I don 't want anything . Just say it . I don 't want anything . I just wanna help . The only way you can help is if you leave , and to take me with you . Mm-mm . I can 't do that . Just take me with you . If Jenny wanted to leave , would you take her ? No . No , I wouldn 't do that . I wouldn 't want for any of you to go through what it 's like out there . Is this what you want ? No . Look , you 're a very beautiful young girl , but this isn 't really right . I don 't think this whole situation we 're in is really right . Stop this . Stop fighting Jenny . You 're family . What 's the use ? Jenny 's never gonna leave . We 're never gonna leave this hole . OK . Listen , there is something more I can tell you , but until you ... Look , you want us to stay , you want us to leave , what do you want from us ? You guys helped me . I just wanna return the favor . Jenny may buy into your lies , but I don 't . What lies ? You can 't help us . Jenny 's never gonna leave now . Danika 's dying . We 're all gonna die here . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to wake you up , little one . I was just ... I 'm just gonna go up to the big house and grab something , OK ? Will you go to sleep for me ? I promise , I 'm gonna be right back . Go back to sleep . Sorry , I didn 't mean to startle you . I 'll let you get some sleep . Don 't go . Not if you don 't want to . I wouldn 't mind the company . Here . Do you read ? Yeah . Yeah , I used to . What did you read ? Oh , everything . No , mostly textbooks and novels . My dad , he got all of these old books and gave ' em to me . We mostly just read picture books now , and Danika really like ' em . I don 't know if she can even really understand any of it . I think mostly she just likes to hear the sound of my voice . Something other than me and Sarah fighting or talking about not having enough to eat . Sarah said something about Danika . Is she sick ? I ... I don 't wanna believe it . I mean , I know all of the signs are there , but ... you know , things happen now that just don 't make any sense . I guess that 's the way the world is . But you know , she ... she has everything she needs here , and all that we can really do is make sure she doesn 't suffer the way my father did . He had it ? There is a cure out there . It 's just a matter of time . Yeah . Do you like to read ? You OK ? I don 't really know what I 'm doing . Do you wanna just lie here with me , just until I fall asleep ? OK . Mommy , Mommy ! Look , Mama 's just gonna go away for a few days , OK ? I 'm gonna be back . I promise . Where 's Mom ? Sarah . Sarah ! Ryan ! Sarah ! Ryan ? Where 's your sister ? Sarah ! Where are you ? Come on . Help me with this . You hungry ? We 'll go inside and get some food ? Danika , come on . Eat your food . It 's gonna get cold . Dani . Danika . Danika , look at me . Don 't make me ask you again , little lady . That 's it . Come on . Come on , Dani . Eat your food . Come on . Come on , just take a bite . Hey , hey , look at me . Danika . Danika , you need to eat your food . Danika ! Danika , Danika , stop it ! Danika ! Danika , stop it and eat your food . Eat ... eat your food ! Oh , little girl . Hey , hey . Honey . Honey , I 'm so sorry I yelled like that . Hey , hey . Honey , are you OK ? We 're OK , right ? Here , come on . Come on . You can have mine , OK ? Come on , baby girl . Just a little bite . Come on . Good girl ! Good girl . Danika , what 's wrong ? Honey , it 's fine . Come on . Come on . Just eat a little more . Come on . Baby , come on . Come on , baby . Just take a bite , please ? OK , OK . We don 't have to do that . We can do something else . Do you wanna read ? We can read your book , OK ? We 're gonna be OK . We 're gonna be OK . Hey there . Danika honey go inside and get the axe . Go ! What do you want ? Wanted to see if maybe you could help me out . We don 't have any food or water . You know , it ain 't safe out here for a couple of young girl . You need to leave . Leave ... now ! Relax , young lady . I 'm just here looking for a boy . I think he might have passed by here the last couple days . I don 't know what you 're talking about . His name is Ryan . Now , he 's my brother 's boy . I 'm just looking for the boy . I don 't mean any harm . Get back ! Hey , come on , now . Is this really necessary ? Can 't we just discuss this like civilized folk ? Oh , sister 's a feisty one , isn 't she , huh ? Get back . Well , maybe she knows where he is , huh ? Hey . You put that axe down . That was a warning . Next time , I 'm not gonna miss . Listen here , Miss . I 'm a reasonable man . I 'm a patient man . But I 've only got so much . Now , for the last time , you put that goddamn axe down before you find yourself in a situation that you cannot get out of . Now , there 's my boy . I knew you 'd still be hanging around this lovely place . You knew him ? Come on . Uncle Charlie . My boy . You lied to me . Well , I wouldn 't put too much on it , sweetheart . There 's very few who can resist these soft blue eyes , huh ? You let her go ! Now the whole family 's here . What do you say we all sit down for a nice supper as a family ? We don 't have enough for you . You know , lying don 't look pretty on a nice young girl like you . Besides , my boys don 't eat that much , do you , fellas ? Nope . There 's enough for everyone . I 've seen it . We can all share . They have food and water . Shut up ! No need to get mad at him , young lady . We 're all on the same side . This isn 't a matter of you versus us . This is how we can help you . And vice-versa , of course . What do you say ? Let 's eat . Here it is . Go on . Open her up . See what we got inside . I have a key . You guys are gonna love this . And you thought he 'd gone soft , huh , boy ? Sit down . Oh , tastes good . So what are we cooking up for supper , then ? Or we help ourselves ? You 're too kind . All right , boys . Grab what you want . No . Grab these , eh ? No , no , please . We don 't have enough . Come on , now . We aren 't greedy men . We take what it needs to survive . So how long have you ladies been here ? We 've been here since the beginning . Jenny , don 't tell them anything ! He ain 't talking to you . No , please . Please , don 't touch her ! Relax , young lady . We 're just getting to know each other . Now , this ... this is all very , very impressive . You built all this yourselves , did you ? No , our father did . You know , it 's men like him that make it so hard to accept where we are now . I take it since he ain 't here he had it ? Yeah . God bless him . God bless him and his sacrifice . Do you know anything about sacrifice ? Hm ? You know , sacrifice is how we get things done . It 's how wars are won . It 's how ideas spread . It 's how civilizations thrive . It 's how we all survive . You know , every single one of us is alive in this room right now because either somebody sacrificed something for us , or we 've sacrificed something . It 's an integral part of the continuation of humanity . Do you know what sacrifice is , little one ? You leave her alone . Now , Eddie back there , he 's also mute . He just stopped talking right after it started happening . It 's kind of crazy how it can change a person , the fear , desperation , all the rest . You 're not here just for food , are you ? You know , we don 't have the luxury of a beautiful compound , like you ladies . We have to travel and fight every day just to stay alive . And every now and again we come across a group . We always just walk right up and ask ' em for a little help , don 't we ? See , the thing we learned is , most people aren 't as open to strangers as you folks are . Look . Why , the last time we walked up on a group of people openly , I lost a nephew . And I swore . I swore I 'd never let that happen to my boys again . So this time , we thought we 'd change things up a bit , right ? Do a little recon before we just jump into a situation . Know what I mean ? Look at those eyes ! That boy couldn 't hurt a fly . Those ... now , those are eyes you can trust . Do you see ? Sacrifice . So what now ? Rest up . That 's it ? Is there a problem ? No problem . Good . Eddie can take the first watch , and you take the second watch . What about him ? He 's done plenty already . I bet he has . Now , you boys listen up . We 've been waiting a long time for this . We 're gonna do things in a civilized manner . Now , one of the boys so much as touches one of them girls before , God help me , I 'll gut you . This is our chance . Can I just have a minute with them ? Alone ? Make it quick . But boss ... He 's just gonna make things right . I 'll take it from here , Eddie . You have to understand . It was just to make sure that it was safe . I never meant to hurt you . You have to believe me . You lied to me . But if I had told you everything , would you still let me stay ? I know that this seems bad , but it isn 't . This is a chance for all of us to rebuild . Charlie is smart . He has a vision . He 's figured all of this out . We 've been waiting for years , and we finally found it . It ? What is " it ? " This place , safety , other people . So girls . You mean that you need girls . Well , how else do you expect us to rebuild ? Hey . I know that I wasn 't completely honest about everything , but you have to trust . Trust you ? After what you 've done ? This is a good thing . This is civilized . " Civilized ? " Being tied up is anything but civilized . You would have died out there . They were only protecting you from yourself . You 're a filthy liar . You betrayed Jenny . I knew it from the first moment I saw you . Please , just listen to me . Oh , you both think you know what 's best . Why don 't you just kill us now , huh ? Spare us from the rest of your lies . No one is gonna kill anyone . Yeah ? Not if I had things my way . If you wanna leave , then leave ... now . I won 't stop you . Go . OK , fine . We 're going . This will be the start of a new beginning . For once , you 'll have the chance to actually live . Jenny , let 's go . Come on. this is our chance . Let 's go . Jenny , please . Please , just hear him out . He could help Danika . He knows about her sickness . Jenny , don 't listen to him . What 's all the racket in here ? I 'm just trying to get them to calm down . I wasn 't talking to you . Get back in that room , before you hurt your pretty little face . I 'm leaving . You ain 't going nowhere , sweetheart . - Don 't touch her ! - Shut up ! I will kill you . Sit down ! Thank you for your cooperation . Come on . You got this covered ? Yes , give me more time . Oh , I ain 't leaving after that . Charlie wants to talk to you . Just you and the little one . What about Sarah ? That 's why I 'm here . Let 's go . No , I 'm not leaving without her . She 'll be fine . Don 't ruin this . Give us a couple minutes , Eddie . Leave us , my boy . I think it 's best if I stay . Really ? Just listen to what he has to say . There 's no need to be nervous . We 'll just talk . Believe it or not , young lady , we 're not here to hurt you . Come on , now . We 're just talking . She 's got it . No . She 's sick . How long ? Listen , I don 't know what you 're trying to do , but ... I 'm just trying to open your eyes . Look , this grown-up talk 's gonna get real boring for her . Why don 't you just let her run along and play ? No , she stays here with me . Danika , wa ... It 's OK . Eddie 's real good with kids . He had two of his own younger than her . And then it all happened . You know the little ones , they don 't tend to last that long . She 's been holding out a while now , still moving , still walking . She 's not sick . Oh , well you can deny it all you want , but it 's not gonna help her , not gonna help us . You ever wonder why she 's still here ? Why you all are still here ? Because my father dedicated his life to make sure that we would survive . Now , where do you think he got that idea from ? Because he left us . It 's because he was chosen . He was given a responsibility . Do you know why the dinosaurs were wiped out ? No , I ... I don 't , but ... You know , those creatures have been extinct for millions of years now . And since human beings have been put on this earth , we 've never had to face extinction . Oh , we 've experienced wars and plagues , storms , millions of us wiped out in a short space of time , but there 's always a few of us left . Do you know why that is ? Because He is one of us . Do you know we 're the only creature that has a soul , a spirit ? And because of that , He 'll never let us go . Without us , there 's nothing . So we have to rebuild and nurture the spirit of humanity . If this is our ark , we 'll survive the flood . And we have to come together . We haven 't proven we can come together yet , but when the time is right , He 'll blessed us with the gift of life . Now , look at you and Danika . She 's got it and she 's still alive . He 's chosen her . Chosen me . You ... I got it , in the beginning , along with millions of others . None of ' em lasted for than a few days . But I 'm still here . You and your sisters are still here . Please , I just wanna save my family . Oh , I know , baby . It 's OK . And you will . You will . You will . But for once in your life , you 're gonna do it like a human being . Hm ? Not scavenging around on the brink of extinction . And Danika ? She 's here for a reason . He put her here so that we can be brought together , a family . He 's given us the answers . And together we 're gonna thrive . He 's all around us . He 's watching over us . Can you feel that ? Stop , get off of me ! Sarah ! Sarah . Jenny , he tried to hurt me . You lied to me . You promised she would be safe . How could you Quiet ! Boss , I ... I didn 't do it . You ... you gotta believe me . You were chosen . And you spit on the hand that cradled you . Eddie , get him outside and bury him as best you can . Ryan , you get girls and you fetch ' em outside . Yes , sir . Heathens are the poison that got us where we are now . And there ain 't no room for them here . It 's OK . It 's OK . I 'm here . I 'm here . I 'm not gonna leave you again . I promise , OK ? Yeah , it 's OK . You 're OK . Hey , Dani . You scared me . We 'll all be OK soon . I 'm sorry things had to happen like this . You 're OK , though . We 'll all be OK . Danika , you do not leave my sight ! How could you let that happen to her ? I didn 't . I don 't know . I don 't know what happened , and that 's the honest truth . Do you really think Charlie can help us ? Yes , he can . I wouldn 't be here and have gone through all of this if I wasn 't sure about that , but it wasn 't supposed to happen like this . I 'm sorry for what happened to your sister , but that 's not what we want . I ... How 's she doing ? Betrayed , angry . Everything that I 'm telling her is backfiring . But there 's still hope . More than anything , she just wants Danika to be OK . She 'd do anything for her . And what about the other one ? Reckless . We need to watch her . She 'll get what she deserves . What do you mean ? That boy never did nothing to no one . He did a whole lot of talk , but he ain 't never acted on it . Why did you kill him ? This is more important than one man 's life . We found the key , and we gotta preserve it . The day that I came here , Danika was outside that gate just waiting . It was like she knew I was coming . She knew we were coming . Sarah ! Sarah ! Sarah ? Vanity , vanity , says the preacher . Vanities , vanities , all is vanity . And what does man gain from all his labor ? He can 't make it . End it now , before it 's too late . Why have you forsaken us ? I 'm sorry I failed you . No ! No , Dani , no ! Dani , please . Where 's Danika ? Sit down and eat . Where is she ? Hey . Hey , are you OK ? Is everything all right ? Something 's not right . Sarah ? What is it ? No . No . No ! No . Jenny , wait . You lied to me . You lied to me ! You promise that she 'd be safe ! Shut up ! Eddie 's dead . What ? This is evil .

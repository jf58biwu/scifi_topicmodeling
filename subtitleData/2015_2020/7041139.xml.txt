 Hey , guys , I 'm Krystal . And I 'm Brie . Welcome back to our channel . Before we begin this week 's segment , we just wanna give a big shout out to all of our subscribers because there are now ... 50,000 of you . Oh , my God . That 's all over the world . Yeah , and we love getting comments from you guys who can 't really speak English . - It 's so adorable . - It is . Your support just gives us strength and courage to keep exposing the lies of big cosmetics . Anyway , so , speaking of celebrating ... Today , we are going to show you how to do this incredible hot , sexy , effortless party look . The great thing about this is that you literally need - zero product . - What ? So , what you need are these cute , little , colourful bendy straws . I put them in last night . So , we will start by taking out all of the cute , little straws . And you 'll be amazed how the curls , like , totally spring from your head . What ? What ? I know , I know . I know it 's so hard to watch . We 're still not sure what we 're seeing here , Krystal . I know , right ? Like ... not even a top scalp specialist knew what was going on there . But I told Brie I have white-hot friends so ... - Thank you for helping me . - Yeah . Yeah , thank you . Sure , with what , exactly ? She 's been poisoned . By big cosmetics . What about ... What about that is confusing ? - Sarah ? - Dyad 's here for Kira . Good morning . Mum , she 's not well . How are you , Kira ? - I barfed this morning . - So I hear . She doesn 't have a fever . You don 't want to miss a visit with Rachel do you ? You 're too sick , babe . You 're gonna stay here . No , Mum , I wanna go . Hey . You 're wearing a bell ? What are you , his livestock now ? No . It 's my own punishment . Yanis and Salvador are both dead because of me . No , no , no , no . That 's all Westmorland . You 've gotta get over this place , Mud . Mud , Mud , come on , break the spell . Talk to me . Talk to me . Where are you from ? Where are you from ? I 'm just a girl from Seattle , okay ? Nobody cares about me . Then I came here and saw wondrous things . It 's not wondrous , Mud . It 's all a lie . He 's not who he says he is . I 'm not letting you out . Look , you know what he 's doing to my niece , who is eight years old ? He 's gonna fertilise over 1,000 of her eggs and implant them in surrogates . Experimental children . Like Yanis . Come on . Let me out . Let me out so I can warn my family . - No . - No , no , no , Mud ! My niece ! Think of my niece ! Please ! - He 's gone . - You did so well , babe . You really did , love . I 'm sorry , but you should be done being sick . Syrup of ipecac usually does three good pukes . So , what the hell , S ? We did all of this on account of Delphine ? She travelled here from the island at great personal risk . To warn us to keep Kira away from Dyad . And she and Cosima have identified whatever gene they 're looking for in Kira ? Westmorland 's fountain of youth gene . LIN28A . Maybe that 's the same gene that makes my mouse 's skin grow back . Delphine is gonna rendezvous with Adele and Felix in Geneva . They 've sent new dirt on the Neo money trail . Rachel has been busy . Neolution-infiltrated companies have made huge acquisitions in healthcare and also some ... Some kind of odd sectors , but maybe Delphine can give us some context with that . Okay , I see how Delphine can be involved in this , but is she the source who got you Coady ? I have more than one source . And you know when to leave well enough alone . Made you tea . Yeah , Art , what 's up ? This is gonna sound crazy but we may have a lead . Are you near a laptop ? So , our blog is super popular . We exposed inconvenient truths about big cosmetics . So , it 's retaliation obviously . Aha ! Thanks , Krystal . Uh , Art , what are they on about ? She 's been poisoned , okay ? Probably by those Swedish Neolutionists . Like that Russian whose hair fell out when they put a nuclear bomb in his tea . Is she actually necessary ? 'Cause she is so rude , every single time . Okay , she 's an operative , like you , Krystal . Okay ? So right now we just need to stick to the facts . Now , you said that they were targeting a cosmetics exec that you met ? Oh , yeah . Leonard Sipp . Len is like ... He 's like an artist in the industry . We met at a trade show . Girl , he 's totally into you . He 's only the CEO of Blue Zone Cosmetics . It 's an amazing company . So ethical . Yeah , and I was totally cultivating him as a source . So what ? My deep throat 's totally hot . Get over it Anyway , he invited us to this really amazing party at his penthouse . But then , the day that they poisoned Brie 's hair , he totally stopped calling me . He didn 't return my calls or my texts . He just , like , ghosted me . They got to him for sure . Nobody ghosts Krystal . It 's difficult at first , but you get used to it eventually . All right , guys . Just grabbing this document that confirms that Len Sipp sold Blue Zone Cosmetics to a Dyad subsidiary . Just last week . Dyad ? Yes , Mr Frontenac ? Kira Manning seems to have come down with the flu . I verify it as , " She emptied the contents of her stomach onto my shoes . " Mr Westmorland wants to begin her hormone treatments . As she is ill , I thought it best to let her recover at home . Not arouse suspicion by dragging her out of there . We 'll let her rest for now . With Yanis gone , perhaps you 'll focus on what 's important . Kira 's mutation . For that , we need Cosima . Kira will be much easier with her on side . Cosima can rot . Your mask is slipping , Percival . She saw through you . Dialysis ? - What 's wrong with your kidneys ? - Nothing . Stop fussing . Go . Should I be concerned ? You may be dying , but I am here to make sure it 's not fatal . Do you remember who I am ? John . Of course I remember . But no one else does . If you think we don 't need the myth , you 've gone mad . Was I mad when I began all this ? No , you were ... Magnetic . If a meddling student . And you were brilliant . But it was 1962 , and you were a woman . And what I couldn 't get with brains , I bought . By fortune and fiction . That 's how the patriarchy works . John , what is your point ? Your fictions . Your lies . Your crafty little workarounds . All to push your crazed ideals . But you weren 't the only scientist I bought , were you ? Susan . Guess you weren 't expecting me . Been a long time since the three of us were in this room together . You bought me from that mercenary , Ferdinand . Locked me up , drooling on myself for months . Guilty . I disapprove of genocide . She is not a Neolutionist . She is a maniac . We do not need to cull segments of the population to genetically advance the human race . Well , it sure would speed things up . Thirty years ago , I separated CASTOR from LEDA at Susan 's request . Now , I have you both here ... I realise that was a mistake . Progress requires equilibrium . Balance of opposing forces . No friction ... No fire . Well , welcome back , Virginia . Cosmetics . Why would Neolution be expanding into cosmetics ? Well , because it 's a $ 700 billion industry , for one . - More research dollars than cancer . - Piss off . Serious . Well , it 's got to be connected to LIN28A . Did Krystal just fall arse backwards into something big again ? I do not know how the girl does it . Seriously , you don 't ? Wonder if Krystal ... Could make Len Sipp talk ? Oh , chicken ... Is that a good idea ? That is not a good idea . That was my initial thought too , Arthur . But we did buy ourselves some time with Kira . There 's a window here to figure out the bigger picture . It 's a good way to connect the dots . If they 're using LIN28A , this guy would know . Just get Krystal to set me up with a meeting with Sipp . Okay . I 'll try . We need to move quickly , Arthur . So set it up for tonight . - Mum ? - Mmm-hmm . I have a new codename for the island . Wonderland . And if I have to , I 'll hustle Rachel . No , no , no . You 've done your part today . Now it 's my turn . - What ? Do you like Krystal ? - I love Krystal . I love you . You 've got it wrong . Len is Mr Vegan King of the industry . He would never sell his company to Dyad . Okay , that 's all I wanna talk to him about . Well , I should talk to him . He 's my source . You and that Australian girl are gonna , like , mess the whole thing up . Okay , look , Krystal , I think the best thing for you to do is to stay here and support Brie . Scott is gonna run some tests and believe me , you 're in good hands . Okay , look , just call Len , all right ? And tell him that you wanna meet him at your place . I 'll take care of the rest . Fine , give me your phone . We never met , but you know me . I knew the previous occupant down here . Your sisters too . Sarah and Helena . You 're Virginia Coady ? Just re-familiarising myself with the facilities . This lab 's an old friend . - Are you taking inventory ? - Don 't worry . You 're not deadstock yet . Still Susan 's beautiful baseline , aren 't you ? I never accepted that . I don 't get it . Your family ... Kira 's mutation , Helena 's fetal stem cells ... they will be exploited . If you shifted your thinking one step ... you could be part of it . There 's a pet project I could use you on . They 've developed the most ingenious delivery systems while I 've been gone . Frankly , you 're all too insane . Virginia Coady is here ? Yes , she escaped . And he brought her here . Her influence is the last thing we need . He 's losing his grip . He 's going to destroy everything . - Did she ask about me ? - Ira , she is a monster . Yes , but she created CASTOR . As a weapon . I raised you as a human being . I would still like to learn about myself . I 'm sorry . She 's evil . I locked her up to keep her away from my science . And P.T. has resurrected her ? I should 've killed her when I had the chance . Susan . You 're not a murderer . No , I 'm everything but . And that may have to change . Well , then ... Let me try and get close to her . Okay , I need to take a blood sample to test for any toxins in your system . Yeah , you should take off your sweater , Brie . What ? So you don 't get any blood on it . - Right . - Okay . - Sorry . - Obviously . - Dr Scott . - Mmm-hmm . Are you really a doctor ? - No , but I dropped out of a doctorate . - Still pretty good . My hair is super fragile and I was wondering if you could help me take off my sweater . Uh , yeah . - Okay ? - Yeah . - Great . - Maybe I 'll just ... You can hold my hair and I 'll ... Yeah ? Okay ? Oh , jeez ... Krystal , can you ... Krystal ? This was Salvador 's dream . But now he 's gone . We believe in the founder 's promises . A longer life . We came for the fountain . And only found death . What happened ... Baby has no father . Where do I go from here ? Hello . Do you remember me ? Vaguely . Well , you were only four when Susan separated you . It was tough for everyone . How you screamed , leaving your brothers . Are there any of my brothers left ? Hold here . Pick . Just one . Good boy . These children ... What is this all for ? Susan certainly remade you in her image , didn 't she ? Some singers are dancers . All dancers are slim . So , there are no slim singers . True or false ? Have you shown any symptoms ? No . Did Susan tell you ? I 'm close to a cure . She never even tried to fix you , did she ? Krystal , you took off . I told you to leave this to us . This is my operation now . Listen , hold on a second . You don 't know what you 're getting yourself into . No , you don 't know what you 're getting into . I 'm getting into a dress . And then , I 'm gonna get down to the truth . - Oh , well , she 's gone rogue then . - Yeah , that 's right . If anybody should know if Len Sipp is a hypocrite , it 's me . No , no , we don 't need to know if he 's a hypocrite . We need to know why Dyad is buying up cosmetic companies . Great , then pay attention because I have a surveillance kit and an earpiece . - You do ? - Yeah , I do . I am texting you the passcode right now . He 's here . So , I 'm point . You 're backup . Get over it . Okay , how do I look ? Testing , testing . - I look cute , right ? - Krystal . - Don 't yell . I can hear you . - Just be careful . Sipp might not be the guy you think he is . - Hey . - Hey , Krystal . - What 's happening ? - Nothing . You look nice . Well , you totally ghosted me . Len , what happened ? Baby , I 'm sorry . What are you doing ? - Krystal ? - No , Krystal . Keep it together . Do not kiss him . Hey , Krystal , come on now . Pull back , think of your roommate . - Shut up . - What ? - No , don 't stop . - Stop . - Stop , don 't yell . - I 'm not yelling . - Get him to talk . - Okay . Len , talk . Talk to me . Len , why ... Didn 't you return my calls ? Come on . Look . You 're great , Krystal . - Thank you . - I 've just got a lot on the go , you know ? Yeah , well , me too . I 'm fine , emotionally . Like , I just thought we had a connection . Look , I just gotta prioritise my career right now , babe , you know ? Hey . I just closed a huge deal . And ... I 've been partying for days . - You wanna join the party ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - Mmm-hmm . Oh , shit . Babe , I gotta take this . Be right back . Okay , steer him to Dyad . - Don 't make it obvious . - Len , you sold your company to Dyad . How do you know that ? Because we 're insiders , Len . People in the beauty game talk . Well , they shouldn 't . They sign non-disclosures . How could you sell to Dyad ? They , like , product test on bunnies . And humans . I 'm just gonna take this . Okay . Yo , Kev . Hey , man . The good news is , it doesn 't look like anybody fed you any radioactive isotopes . Just a little hair loss . Some erythema . That 's rashing . It 's probably an allergic reaction . You haven 't been poisoned . You 're not going bald . Thank you . I 'm weirdly into smart guys lately . - You 're like , what ? Normcore ? - Yeah . The normest . That 's so interesting . So ... Have you eaten any new foods or tried any new products lately ? Huh . Okay , so , I probably shouldn 't admit to this because Len Sipp is such a big deal ... but I kinda have a tiny problem with stealing things . I haven 't made the budget either . Okay , when he gets off the phone , you go after him . Yeah . Ask him why Dyad would be interested in a cosmetics company . See if it has anything to do with this gene called LIN28A . - Lin what ? - 28A . Listen , Krystal . I know you can do this , all right ? I believe in you . Just for the love of God , keep it in your pants , okay ? Congratulations to you too , brother . All right , ciao . Now ... Where were we ? It was , like , somewhere around here . - Or was it there ? Stop it . Uh , stop it . You 're making me wet and I 'm super mad at you . I am . Dyad is a bad corporate citizen . - Well done . - Thank you . Well , it 's a business , you know . I have shareholders . Yeah , but why would Dyad want a cosmetics company ? I don 't know , it 's like , why did I buy a yacht ? It 's ' cause it 's cool . Len , I know you , okay ? You 're an innovator . Together , we could stand up to big cosmetics . That 's why you approached me at that trade show because we 're truth tellers and you liked my vlog . I liked your vlog ? Your vlog is great . It 's a great vlog . I also liked that dress you were wearing . That was a great dress . Just give me a minute . He is such a liar . All right , just hang in there , Krystal . He didn 't even like my vlog . - Yeah , Scott , what 's up ? - I might have something . Krystal 's gonna be so mad . Coady was collecting blood from a healthy child ? Yes , I saw many litres to be processed . That 's what he was preparing in his study . He 's doing parabiosis . I think so . Young blood for old veins . He 'll try anything to extend his pitiful life . Highly suspect science . But we can use this . Whatever you 're thinking , Susan ... We can just leave . I can help you to the boathouse . You know me better than that . He and Coady are too dangerous together . Coady said she was close to a CASTOR cure . She 's lying . Ira , she was never close . The best mind for your cure is locked up in the basement . Cosima . She has influence with Mud , doesn 't she ? - Yes . - Good . We will need her . I sacrificed everything for Neolution . People I loved . Perhaps even my own soul . But now , Ira , it is time to bring it all down . ... Lebanese chicks . Man , they are hot . Krystal ? Krystal , you still there ? I 'm peeing and then I 'm gonna kick him in the balls . No , you will not kick him in the balls . Okay , we 've got some news from Scott . Brie is gonna be fine . But when you guys were at the party at Len 's house , she stole some face cream . Oh , my God . She 's such a klepto . Scott thinks it might be experimental . There should be some left in her floral make-up bag . Which one ? She has , like , nine . Oof . My God . Oh , Lenny boy . - Shit . - Krystal , we have a problem . Yeah , because I have one make-up station and Brie 's shit is everywhere . No , no , Len found the cream . - Krystal . - He 's at the door . - I know he 's at the door . - Oh , okay . This is how you 're gonna play this , Krystal . - You 're gonna go out there ... Krystal , get out . Now . What 's this ? - You tell me . - You stole this from me . Brie did . My partner in that vlog that you love so much . She used it and now she 's sick . - What 's in it ? - She used it ? It 's a prototype . It 's experimental . Jesus Christ , woman ! How stupid are you ? Oh , I 'm gonna be sick . Oh . Truth-telling time . Talk , Len . - If you don 't talk , I swear to God ... - All right , all right , all right . It 's a dermal delivery system . It 's what Dyad wants . It 's the next big thing in regenerative therapy . Dermal delivery system ? They could put anything in that . Is it LIN28A ? What 's in it ? - " Linda " something ? - What ? It works on a cellular level . That batch is the prototype . It made the rabbit 's hair fall out . No ! My beard . Not my beard . Get out . Yeah , that 's it . What 's happening , Ana ? Another child , Aisha , has died . I thought she was getting better . Where is the founder now ? Why is he silent ? He did this to her . Mud . What happened ? What 's wrong ? Aisha died . Oh , my God . We gotta get out of here . - Don 't you have family in Seattle ? - They don 't want me . I 'm sure that 's not true . - Ira . - Hey . You can 't be down here . Susan has a plan . What are you talking about ? We 're talking about taking a stand against all of this . But we need you too , Mud . - Oh , no , no , no , no . - Yes . We need you . We need you . We need you to tell us when he 's doing his treatments . He 's doing parabiosis . Parabiosis ? Are you joking ? He 's bleeding kids too ? No , it 's just plasma . Mud , parabiosis means he is processing young blood and transfusing it . He 's using everyone here . Anything to prolong his life . We need to stop him . He saved my life , okay ? I 'm just a dirtbag junkie . I stole from my parents . I ruined everything . I couldn 't even OD properly . I ... I was a vegetable for , like , six months . And then I woke up here ... In his house . And now what ? Now you 're his fool ? Mud , are you here by choice ? 'Cause I 'm not here by choice . I just want to tell my parents I 'm sorry . Then help us . Rachel Duncan . Good evening , Rachel . Mr Westmorland ? I thought you didn 't like the phone . Why isn 't Kira at Dyad yet ? You are well-informed again . All your recent corporate acquisitions are rather fruitless . Or a bad piece of the puzzle , wouldn 't you say ? Yes , of course . I 'll take care of it . Yes , you will . Not now , busy . Why didn 't you tell me that you 're using parabiosis ? Because I knew you 'd have qualms . Blood of the innocent . Bloodletting won 't harm the child . It 's worth a try , I suppose . At least , until the LIN28A mutation is ready . - Oh ! - Oh , dear . Here , let me help you . Yes , good . My child . I 've been watching you for a long time . You have been a great comfort , my child . Now , remove that bell and forgive yourself . - Thank you , sir . - Hmm . Ira . Did Mud come through ? You okay ? What 's happening ? Ira , are you glitching ? I don 't know if I can make it . Take Susan with you . Don 't worry . We 'll all get off the island together . I 'll get Charlotte , and the cure is in the medic trailer , so you get Susan to the boathouse . You need to take this , just in case . What are you doing here ? You know why we 're here . Let 's not make this any harder on her . Just have your men stay back . Hello , sweetheart . Would you like to come recover with us ? It 's , uh ... It 's late . We never agreed to any overnight visits . It 's a sleep study . Completely benign . Come . - Okay . - Good girl . Rachel , look at me . There will come a day when you need us . I 'll be okay , S. Just tell Mom I 'll keep writing my story . What were you doing in there ? - More of Westmorland 's experiments ? - I 'm allowed to be in there . - What are you hiding ? - Hey , hey , hey ! No , no . No , no , no , no , no ! - What 's in here ? - Stop it ! - We 're done being your lab rats . - Let go of me . - What is this ? - No ! No , no , no . No , please . - More of what killed Aisha ? - That 's my medicine . That 's my cure . I need that . - Cosima ! - Just let me leave with my sister . We are keeping the kids here now . Yes , you 're right to protect the children ... From him . Westmorland isn 't ... Isn 't 170 , okay ? Look , look . He 's a liar . Okay ? That 's him and Susan Duncan in 1967 . Look , he 's a young man . How 's that possible ? What about the fountain ? I 'm sorry , but the fountain isn 't real . He deceived you . I know that 's really hard to hear , 'cause he deceived me too . My family , scientists , governments , military , all over the world . He used you all . He 's experimenting on your children . Aisha 's dead because of him . Would you please just let me leave ? They lied . The whole place is a lie ! I thought he was telling the truth . " I heard a thousand blended notes . " Wordsworth . Yes . How ... How does it go ? " To her fair works did nature link this human soul that through me ran . If this belief from heaven be sent , if such is nature 's holy plan . And much it grieved my heart to think what man has made of man . " Hello , Virginia , what 's happening ? She was trying to kill you . No . I was trying to save us all . - Cosima ? - Yeah . It 's too far from the mainland , and I can 't even swim . Hey , hey , this is something you don 't know about me . I grew up on boats . And we 've got a compass and we 've got charts , and we 've got extra gas . It 's really calm tonight , see ? Can you take care of that ? Thank you . I don 't think they 're coming . Susan ? Susan ! Susan , we have to go now . Burn everything ! Revival is a lie ! Get the children out ! Burn every building !

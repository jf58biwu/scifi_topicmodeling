 Barbie : Three weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . The dome has tested our limits ... ( screams ) go ! ... Pitting us against one another . Chester 's mill sentences dale barbara to death . ... And forcing each of us To confront our own personal demons- - Rage ... I need to know that you will stand with me against that ! ... Grief ... Joe : I don 't understand- - who could do this to her ? I promise you , we 're going to catch whoever did this . ... Fear ... We 're trapped . Woman : I hear we 're going to run out of water . ( clamoring ) ( screaming ) You killed angle mcalister . ... Shame . I thought it would bring the dome down . I would do anything to take it back . But we 've also found love under the dome . ( muffled explosion ) And we have battled to keep our town together . I thought the dome was supposed to protect us . No , it 's up to us to protect each other . Now we may finally have found a way out . We 're outside the dome . We hope it takes us home , But what if it takes us to an alternate reality ? Ben : Whatever 's going down in chester 's mill , Here 's proof that it ain 't real . Barbie : These places ... These people ... Something is wrong here . What do you say , red ? Do it . ( grunting with effort ) Man : You okay ? Okay , stay close . Watch your step . Here , use your legs . I got you . Come here , don 't put too much weight on it . ( various people speaking quietly ) ( low humming , buzzing ) ( all groaning with disappointment ) Man : Is this a joke ? ( everyone murmuring , talking indistinctly ) Man : So what are we gonna do now ? Woman : I 'm getting so tired of this ... ¶ ¶ Man 2 : It 's all right . It 's gonna be all right . Man 3 : I just can 't take this anymore . We walked into the white light ... And we just kept going . And the dome was gone . And we were free . The outside world , somehow it seemed more ... More beautiful , You know , more vibrant . Where was i ? You were dead . What did you do after i died ? Julia ... I want to know what it was like for you . There was a funeral , And i met your parents . The only thing i could do Was to get as far away from chester 's mill as possible . Where 'd you go ? Abuja . Kabul . I ran rescue missions . I dreamt about you Every night . Hey , it 's okay . I met a woman . Oh . She doesn 't matter . None of it was real . What happened to your neck ? Your father came back . He brought the egg . My father did that ? No . ( sighs ) Don 's dead . How ? I think melanie killed him . How could you even say that ? Because she tried to kill me , too . Found this in an emergency kit . You should eat something . Come on home . That 's your home , not mine . Course it 's yours . I-i don 't know how i 'm back here . You were in some kind of a-a , a-a cocoon , And-and ... You never went anywhere . I did . I moved on . I got rid of you . This time has to be different , dad . I want to forgive you . For what ? All of it . Locking me up in that bomb shelter , Alone , in the dark . Leaving me up in that tree , forcing me To go get the belt . I saved you . You should be Thanking me . You were a weak little kid . I just tried to make you strong . I was stronger without you . Where ? ! In your little make-believe cocoon world ? You 're still weak . You 're pathetic and afraid . You can punch that dome as many times as you need to , Junior . You 're back under it . Three weeks . That 's how long you and i were in those cocoons . Oh , my god . I know . Christine ... The last thing i remember was us finding that egg . And then i was in an alternate reality for , like , a year . In love with dale , carrying his child . And now we 've hatched And we 're under a dome ? None of this makes sense . We 're anthropologists . But in that world , i was an aid worker . You-you were a therapist . Why were we different ? I can 't tell you that , But ... I think it 's a good thing . If this town knew Who we really are , that we were here to find that egg , We 'd have a lot more to answer for . All those hunts hektor sent us on , Do you think aktaion knew what would happen when we found one ? Tomorrow we 'll go to that town hall meeting And find out what we can . No , i 'm ... I can 't see dale . With her . We have to go . People saw us in those caves . If we don 't show up , they 'll come looking . Is it possible i 'm pregnant ? I don 't think so , hon . It felt so real . It still does . You have always talked about wanting kids . It 'll happen . ( door shuts ) I guess the best way of explaining it is that we were in A simulated reality . Like the matrix . Want to hear something weird ? More weird Than we were in a matrix ? I don 't need my glasses anymore . I can see without them . Maybe the goo that was all over us fixed your eyes . Well , yay , you can see , But we 're still trapped inside this hell bubble . Hunter : Want my sweater ? Yeah . Wh-what are you even doing here ? Uh , i don 't have a house to go to . Can we please go to sleep ? ( sighs ) ( quietly ) : Yesterday we were together . But in the matrix , you moved on without me . So ... What are we now ? I don 't know . It feels like a year 's passed . And i feel ... Different . They 're dead . All of them . Their cycle came to an end . And , unlike you , they won 't be brought back to life . You had a job : Lead the people to be cocooned So that the egg could infuse them with the life force . I tried . I did . I 'm so sorry . Why were we chosen to do this ? You and i made first contact with the egg . When we touched it , we gained A complete understanding of the dome 's agenda : Survive and propagate . But i touched the egg first . 25 years ago . It should have been me inside the queen cocoon , Not you . But you died during the download . Three weeks ago , i came along . From inside my cocoon , i could see That this town was on the brink of destroying itself . What is that stuff ? Oxytocin . It 's a mood regulator . It , plus the alternate reality , was essential To shape these humans into a functioning collective , So that we could gain a foothold . Except ... The transfer of the life force was interrupted . Because big jim destroyed the egg . Because you didn 't protect it . Everyone who was cocooned Has a role to play . We need to finish what we started . Quickly . Well , i can 't go up there . I 'm surprised julia hasn 't come looking for me already . I 'll assess the townspeople And determine how much work is left to do . You handle julia . If she shows up , kill her . Hey . Hey , jim . How are you ? Jim . Hey , there . How are you guys ? How are you ? Big jim : Let 's get this meeting started . Abby . Water ? It 's clean . From my well . Big jim : It 's good to see you all . Safe . Right back here in chester 's mill . You think we 're gonna listen to you , jim ? You ran this town into the ground . Big jim : No , roger , i didn 't . I risked everything To set you free from those cocoons . Because i love this town . And i 'd do anything for it . I 'll get you back on your feet . But first things first . We need answers . For you , for all of you . For my son . The person that has those answers is melanie cross . And i won 't stop until we find that girl . He 's starting a witch hunt for melanie . They 'll kill her before we get any answers . Big jim : She knows what 's going on in this town And i 'm gonna find out what it is . Barbie : Forget melanie . You 're the biggest threat this town 's ever seen . Julia : Barbie ! I saved everyone in there ! Julia : Barbie ! Enough ! Dale ! Who are you ? Big jim : Answer the question . Who are you ? I 'm christine price And this is my friend eva . Excuse me , i need some air . And you all know each other ? Yeah . We do . Christine : Eva and i were in the ... Alternate reality , as strange as it sounds . Sounds pretty strange . Julia : Everyone in the cocoons Was from chester 's mill . But you 're not . No , no . We ... ( laughing ) : We were here on vacation . We went for a hike in the woods and ... Wandered off the trail and ... Big jim : And then what ? We stepped into some kind of a sinkhole , And emerged From those cocoons yesterday , Along with everybody else . When did you go on this hike ? Three weeks ago . That 's some story . I 'm a therapist . I helped this town recover from a trauma- - In the cocoons . It seems as if people could use That same kind of help now ? Shall we ? You 're staying out here . Or what ? Or we tell them everything . Rebecca ... Andrea ... You shot junior . How you came after me . After all i did for you in those caves ? That doesn 't undo everything else . Chester 's mill 's still better off without you . Oh , is it ? Cocoons , Alternate reality ... Yeah . Looks like everyone 's shaken up . Except for christine price . Abby : In the cocoons , we were back with our families And now we are stuck here , again , because of you , Because of melanie . You gonna do something about it ? Look , i-i promise you , i 'll find melanie . All right ? I 'll get us all the answers that we need . What do we do ? I lost my home , too . If you have a house , Open your doors . Let 's share what we have . The last time i stood in front of you , I urged you to find strength in community . We all have something to contribute . There 's gotta be wildlife out there . Joe . You can build traps . Or i could help find melanie . No , christine 's right . We need to eat . I 'll handle melanie . Well , isn 't there food at andrea 's house ? Uh , in the root cellar . Someone can take my car . I 'll go . I 'll go with you . Christine : And i 'll set up an office , here in this building . If anybody needs support , come find me . ( quiet , indistinct conversations ) Sam . There 's a lot of overwhelmed people here . Do you think you could start a support group ? Why would i do that ? Your aa experience in the prison . You could apply it here . People in this town see me as a murderer , Not a counselor . Uh , just ... Think about it . And ... Do you think you could find your nephew ? I didn 't see him here . Julia : She called you " dale . " Julia , i said i don 't want to talk about it . The woman you had a relationship with Is suddenly here , in the flesh . Of course i have questions . Don 't you ? Yeah . I do . About things that really happened . I was in a cocoon , My father 's dead , You were nearly killed And melanie can answer for it all . We need to find her . So , please , can we do that ? ( anxious breathing ) ( groans , sighs ) ( grunts in frustration ) He 's right , you 're weak , you 're weak , you 're pathetic . Oh , just-just-just do something right For once in your life . Sam : No ! Go away , sam . Leave me alone . Go away ! Hey . What 's so bad that you gotta end it all ? Come on . Tell me . The life we had , in the cocoons ? I saw the world . I ... I knew what it was like to be my own man , To be free from my father , And i can 't be back under this dome with him again . I 'd rather be dead . Congratulations , kid . For what ? Hitting bottom . You gotta get here before you 're ready to change . Whatever you found In that other life can help you here . Give me the gun . ( joe and norrie laugh ) Joe : It works . There 's more supplies in andrea 's garage . I 'll get them and set up the traps around the property . Do you want to help me ? It 's been a while since we 've wandered around those woods . We 're not here for nature , we 're here to get food . And then we have to take it back and set it up for everyone . First you volunteer to schlep cans , And now you 're throwing a dinner party for a town you hate ? Well ... We 're all in it together . Root cellar 's out back . Come on , zeta . Let 's grab us some cans of corn . We 'll meet you back at the car . Hey . How does he know what sorority you joined ? I ... Saw him when we were back at the memorial . I must 've told him . You 're really going to counsel people ? Until someone else steps in . I 've got a phd in biological anthropology . I know enough to coach people through a crisis . Do we really need to lie about who we are ? We need to keep their trust . We 're trapped here ; The most important thing is survival . When did you become so calculating ? Please . Remember when we found that meteorite in north dakota ? Who negotiated our exit with that wolf ? ( laughs ) We 've been through so much together . We 'll get through this . But first , we got work to do . What 's that ? Well , i 'll stay here And try to calm people down . You go find the one thing that could expose us . I ... I don 't even know where to start . We have found the remains of ancient civilizations . I 'm sure you can handle this . She 's not here . That 's where you were . And that 's where i saw melanie put the egg ... Right before she tried to kill me . But you saved her . Protected her . Yeah , and then she turned on me . And you can 't deny what she led you into . Everyone in these cocoons was connected . You and eva were together for a reason . Oh , here we go . Now we 're back on this again . We are . Barbie , i saw the way you looked at her . You were together for what felt like a year . That is so much longer than we 've been together , So i understand if you still have feelings . You were not in one of these things , julia . You can 't possibly understand any of this . I 'm trying , but you won 't talk to me . You 're different somehow . Did you love her ? I 'm gonna keep looking for melanie . The tunnel branches off about 30 paces down . I 'll be fine . ( leaves crunch ) Git ... Git . ( barks ) ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ It 's better than nothing . Not by a lot . Well , maybe we can find A stockpile of girl scout cookies somewhere in here . Ugh . Nyc punk ? I didn 't know andrea , but she had serious taste in music . It was probably her kids ' . Unless , you know , she also played lacrosse . Hey , look . Before there was katniss , There was me at summer camp . No tv , no boys , just singing and swimming and sports . Your camp sounds a lot like a sorority with less beer pong . Hey . What 's wrong ? I want it back . That life . I was a part of something , and it felt good . You know ... There 's a way we can feel good right here Under this dome . ( " do you wanna dance " by the ramones plays ) ( laughs ) You 're an idiot . ( chuckles ) you know you want to dance , so come on . No . Just a little head bob , you know ? ( they laugh ) All right , well , you 're welcome . Let 's keep hunting for grub . The town 's counting on us . " support group next door . " You 're all here to see christine ? She offered to help ; we need it . Christine was my counselor while i was in prison . I learned a lot from her . This morning , she asked me if i would lead a support group . You ? Yeah . I 'm not staying . I can 't just tell a bunch of strangers all my problems . Junior , i don 't think you should be alone right now . You have my gun . You can 't babysit me forever . I was giving her a bath . And we were singing a song when it all ended . ( crying ) : And i can 't lose her again . Can you survive one hour without your child ? Abby ? That 's where you start . I 'll be here any hour you need . For all of you . Hey , junior . Excuse me , there 's , um , people in there , waiting for you . Oh , shoot . I was out looking for food . It 's good to see you again , james . We never really met . How you doing ? I 'm okay . Now , how about the truth ? The truth ? I don 't know how i 'm gonna survive here . In that other world , i killed my father , I was ready to burn down his house . That was the life that i wanted- - To be free from him . But ... I 'm here . You were about to make a breakthrough . If you really want to be who you were Finish what you started . Drop the match . We are what we do . We are what we do . Julia ... ! Everything started here . ( running footsteps approach , barbie panting ) Barbie : You 're okay . Are you okay ? What happened ? I found ben 's body . His neck was bruised just like yours . He said he saw melanie in the alternate reality . He didn 't die from an asthma attack . He died because she killed him here . I 'm sorry i left you alone . I think all this was way more real than i wanted to admit . Including eva . Tell me . I mourned you , julia . Time passed . And i fell in love with her . And that , with her That feels like yesterday . ( punk rock blares from distance ) ¶ hey , hey , hey ! ¶ Andrea . ¶ hey , hey , hey ! ¶ ( norrie and hunter laugh ) ¶ back around ¶ ¶ i hear you coming back around ¶ ¶ yeah , you 're rolling like the little sound ¶ ¶ it 's back around ¶ ¶ hey , hey , hey ... ¶ Norrie ( laughing ) : Stop . ¶ gonna do it , gonna do- - ¶ ( music stops ) Hunter : Hey , davy crockett . Why 'd you shut the party down ? " party " ? This is a crime scene . What the hell did you do with andrea ? She was like that when we got here . We covered her and moved her . You put her outside ? Like trash ? Ever smelled a dead body ? I 've known her my whole life . Even if you guys didn 't , she was a human being . Joe , she would want us to eat . What 's the big deal about us listening to music While we search for food ? You 're right . All right , let 's see what old thelma and louise are up to . And we 're rolling . According to the dark flight calculations of the meteoroid And magnetometer readings , We believe we have located the target Here in chester 's mill . Therapist , my ass . Eva : Is it intact ? It 's perfect ! There 's a faint dusting of quartz . Possibly amethyst ? ( eerie electronic purring ) There appears to be some kind of ... Energy reserve . Christine , i think you should put it down . ( crash ) Drop it ! Drop it ! Drop it , christine ! ( screaming ) What the ... ? ( coughs ) Junior ! What the hell have you done ? I 'm just doing what i have to do in order to move on . What ? ! Christine was right . I needed to finish what i started . Christine ? Let me tell you something . She 's not who you think she is . Those cocoons ? I think she 's responsible . I should thank her . I 've never been happier . This makes you happy ? I don 't feel it . It 's gone . What 's gone ? You . You don 't exist . You 're not my father anymore . ( whistling ) ( birds chirping ) Uh ... ( squealing ) Shh , it 's okay ! It 's okay . I 'm not like them . I 'm like you- - trapped . Go find your friends . ( squealing ) ( arrow fires from bow ) ( high-pitched squealing ) Nice shot . Why 'd you kill it ? It 's what the town needs , joe . Your leg okay ? I 'm good . Aah ! ( groaning ) Looks like it 's just the two of us . Julia ! ( gunshot ) Aah ! Aah ! ( grunting ) ( panting ) ( grunts ) Melanie ... Stop . I 'm sorry , julia . This needs to happen . Get off ! ( gasps , grunts ) Melanie ... ( grunting ) I should 've just cocooned you , like the others ! Things would 've been so much better . ( gasps ) Are you okay ? What happened ? I was out looking for food and i saw this girl . She , she was strangling julia . Oh , my god , what 've i done ? ! You saved my life . ( crying ) Guess this is as good a place as any . The place where he died . And where melanie came back to life . Now we 'll never know why she did that to us . I just need a little time alone . Of course . Hey . I love you , julia . We 're gonna get through this , okay ? I love you , too . I 'll be back in an hour . I 'll see you back at the motel . Yeah . Overkill for a fishing trip . I 'm getting out of here . You 're leaving town ? Do you know what happens inside a cocoon ? That fuzzy little caterpillar liquefies . And when it comes out , It 's something else . Those people , they 're , uh , They 're not the same . Well , of course they 're not . Think about what they 've been through . No , i mean they 're not the same . They 've changed . Junior , he-he burned down the house , And whistled while it blazed , all dead behind the eyes . He finally stood up to you . I know my son . That 's not him . You think your precious little barbie 's the same ? No way . Barbie and i are gonna be Just fine . But you ? You 're run out of town . You do whatever you need to To rationalize that . Listen . I 'm right about them . Just like i was right about everything else . Get out of here . Get out of my boat ! ( barks ) Go home . ( barks ) ( scoffs ) ( barks ) ( chuckles quietly ) ( barks softly ) You ever hear of the designated survivor ? He goes off on his own when the ... President and all the bigwigs Are doing the state of the union . Well , bud , that 's you and me . We 're gonna be out there on bird island . Christine : James was the closest- - A seed , ready to sprout- - Once he shed his fear . With the right amount of nurturing , sam could be next . They came when i signaled , without knowing why . The life force has taken root . Some are compelled to serve their duties . Some will require cultivation . Others must be pruned away . Weeds are stronger than they seem , A threat to what must blossom . But , with careful tending , This kinship will grow into what we need it to be .

I 'm going to find you . Fuck ! Let 's go . Where 's the truck ? I don 't know . Come on . I left my gun in the truck . Which way ? Where 'd they go ? What 's he doing ? I think he 's helping us . I moved it around back . Why are you helping us ? Because he 's a fucking maniac . Why else do you think ? You better get out of here before he comes back . but we need to talk to somebody first . Lemuel Washington . The diner 's closed . I see that . You know where he lives ? [ Door knock ] Frank . I 've got nothing to say . How about you tell me what you 're doing with a gun ? Keep your damn voice down . It 's for protection . - Protection ? - Do you blame me ? After what happened ? Do you know what the Pons will do if they catch you with a gun ? Ed . Do you get that ? I can 't just do nothing . except you take it . or you get yourself killed . - Frank . - What ? are you ? - No . - Then what ? What is it ? Is it revenge ? Are you going to take a shot at that cop that killed Laura and her kids ? okay ? I 'm really tired . - I don 't- - - Go home . Just go home . Come on . Out . Come on . Get out of here . leave . shit . You 're not going to take a shot- - - Are you crazy ? - Go ! Just fucking leave ! The prince had nothing to do with what happened to Laura . and a thousand cops will take his place . you drive a stake right through their fucking hearts . and your life is over . It 's already over . What about Juliana ? Juliana ? She- - okay ? She 's gone . Frank . That 's not true . and you know that . just like you were there for her when she needed you . No . please . Don 't give up . please promise me that you won 't give up . Please promise me . All right . All right . I 'll get rid of the gun . I don 't know where I was going to find bullets for it anyway . good . Why don 't you give it to me ? I 'll do it . no . I 'll take care of it . I promise . Okay . Hi . I like your doll . What 's her name ? Annie . Annie . That 's my mother 's name . You kids come on inside . What the hell are you doing here ? We need to speak to you . How do you know where I live ? We came to warn you . Warn me about what ? right below my sister 's . This motherfucker stays by the truck . You come inside . hold on a second . It 's okay . take the kids upstairs . It 's okay . Sit down . Your sister 's name is Trudy Walker ? She was supposed to bring you the film . and I took her place . What is your name ? Juliana . Juliana Crain . We were half-sisters . some kind of list ? the one who made paper animals . I thought he was my contact . He tried to kill me . It went the other way . Where 's the body ? In the river . We sunk it . You and him ? we found a woman that this man had tortured . You knew her ? Her - Her name was Linda . She disappeared a few days ago . she must have given him the list of names . They were all crossed off except for my sister 's and yours . We 're dead . Maybe not . Nobody 's seen the list except for us . and you didn 't tell me . I didn 't trust you . I sure as hell don 't trust him . Have you seen the films ? It 's not my job to see them . I just pass them along . Then you don 't know what they mean . I just know they help kill Nazis . Now you give me that goddamn film . And you get the hell out of my house . not anymore . I 'll give it to the man you give it to . That ain 't how it works . I 'm not here to kill Nazis . and I 'm not leaving until I get them . Lem ? Who is it you give the films to ? Well ? Spirit Alley Trail . What 's there ? He 's going to take me to meet the man he 's supposed to give my film to . Who 's that ? The Man in the High Castle . Hello . Obergruppenfuhrer . Joe . It 's two hours- - sir . But I 've made contact with the Resistance operative . John . Joe . Helen . did he ask for the film ? I told him I 'd only give it to his superior . I don 't suppose you 've got a name . He said it 's the Man in the High Castle . The Man in the High Castle ? sir . Joe . These are very dangerous men you 're dealing with . I understand . No . You think you understand . but you 're young . you suffer from the arrogance of ignorance . sir . sir ? do I give him the film ? No . You leave the film in the truck . I want you to put a bullet in his head ... even if it costs you your life . Joe ? Yes ... Obergruppenfuhrer . When 's this meeting due to happen ? Tomorrow morning . Then I 'll await your call . Joe ... no matter what happened ... you 'll receive a hero 's funeral ... with full honors . sir . Heil Hitler . Heil Hitler . Tagomi-San . My husband is troubled . He fears our grip on the Empire is loosening . Your Highness . Of course . but do you feel that that fear is valid ? One thing is certain : none more so than the Pacific States . they will strike . The generals wish my husband to make a war cry to frighten the Nazis so they back down . But he- - that we must seek for peace . but the Prince is not weak . Peace is not weakness . Forces may yet emerge that will allow him to move toward peace with strength . What forces ? Tagomi-San . But I fear these forces will arrive too late . aren 't you ? One of my boys has a fever . I 'm going home to check on him . Any sign of that waitress ? Nope . And if I said that you were a fucking liar ? Marshal . That doesn 't change my answer . Mr. Washington ? I am . Better take care of those strays of yours . they can die of anything . You got the film ? Yeah . I can do this on my own . I can 't let you go alone . I 'm going with you . Let 's go . Mr Tagomi . I- - I wasn 't expecting you until later . It was urgent I speak to you . I brought some- - She 's just leaving . You shouldn 't have taken such a risk . She could be working for the Kempeitai . No Japanese spy would do the things that woman did . Mr Tagomi . I avail myself a more earthly means . The Imperial Guard has approved the seating for the speech . I have you sitting next to the Science Minister . Place the envelope in his coat pocket while the Prince is speaking . you 'll never have access to him again . Joe : How much farther ? Lem : Not that far . Juliana : Can you explain something to me ? You 've never seen a film . your family 's lives . Why ? I do my part . That 's all . And you have no idea how he makes them ? Who ? The Man In the High Castle . does he ? You don 't think we 'd waste all this time do you ? So why does he want them ? And where do they come from ? We 're here . Where is he ? He 's not coming . Lem ? Give me the film . OK . Get on your knees . Lem ? I wouldn 't have if you hadn 't brought this goose-stepping motherfucker along with you . The cell he was from in New York just as he got in his goddamn truck . What c-cell ? What cell ? but I couldn 't . - I 'm with the Resistance . - Bullshit . or they wanted him to escape because he 's one of them . It 's real . Believe me now ? He helped me . He tried to warn you about your name on that list . He used you . He used you to get to the Man In the High Castle . Why else would he be here ? Okay . I 'm a Nazi ... then why do I bring this ? Film 's good . the Marshal will kill you . So where do we go ? Cripple Creek . It 's the other side of that mountain . That 's impossible . We can never make that climb . Lem . I can 't . I 'm sorry . You 're not fooling anybody . I know you watch those Japanese shows . you 're out of luck . I haven 't gone to the market yet . I talked to Bob Perloff . He has Frank 's sister on his mail route . I 've got some bad news . Good afternoon . May I help you ? I hope so . I 'm looking for a rather unusual item . you 've come to the right place . American Artistic Handcrafts is a veritable cornucopia of the recherch√© . What did you have in mind ? Antique bullets . The kind that fit the old Colt .45 . I 'm sure you 're aware that the sales of ammunition are restricted and strictly illegal to sell to non-Japanese . I was hoping you might make an exception for a highly motivated buyer . Pardon me . We have passed by your store many times and always meant to come in . I am most honored by your splendid presence . You have such fine pieces . I would guess . You have a keen eye . What a pleasure it is to speak with someone who has an appreciation for American traditional ethnic art . I 'm afraid I spend my morning trying to educate a gaggle of white-sock yokels - in from the sticks . - Excuse me . but we were in the middle of a transaction . Perhaps we will come back another time . that 's not- - I will be waiting . Close the doors . Only three ? and I can 't guarantee they 'll fire . They 're 100 yen apiece . 300 . What is that ? I 'm required by law to keep a registry of all sales of restricted items . So these bullets were purchased a collector on his way back to Tibet . But I will need to see your identity card and that is non-negotiable . all right . Come on . I suggest Mr Frink . Hello ? Frank ? Jesus . Anne . Did I scare you ? I 'm sorry . it 's okay . so I just used my key . Where 's Juliana ? I think . You think she could spend a little less time flipping ' Japs and a little more time doing housework . This place is a mess . what happened to your face ? it was an accident at work . It 's nothing . I heard about Laura and the kids . I 'm so sorry . Who told you ? Arnold heard it . It 's just awful . That cut . have they ? no . I 'm fine . I have work to do . No . You 're awfully good . At what ? Lying . well ... Why didn 't you tell me ? Because I have orders . Orders . and your orders say you can 't tell me . What 's it like ? What 's what like ? The Resistance . Not the best man to ask . It 's my first mission . yeah ? Yeah . I 'm not off to a good start . didn 't you ? I guess . What did you think of it ? I didn 't watch it . Joe . You 're not supposed to . It 's not like I have a projector in the truck anyway . You weren 't even tempted to hold it up to the light or something ? No . Captain ? We 've completed our review of the phone records of the six officers outside yourself who had access to your travel routes and to the routes of Hauptsturmfuhrer Lautz . And ? there 's absolutely no evidence of a security breach of any kind . And yet we know there was a security breach ? sir . is that you 've failed . Captain . Do you understand me ? Not when it involves a coordinated attack on the high command . did you manage to locate any members of his family ? we did . one in the Neutral Zone and another in the Pacific States . shall we ? Why was a prisoner on suicide watch given a spoon ? He wasn 't . It wasn 't on the tray when I brought it . It- - It couldn 't have been . I- - I would have seen it . Place this man under arrest . We 'll never make it over those mountains . the Marshal will probably be waiting on the other side . Joe ? isn 't it ? Yeah . It is . A guy like you must have it made in the Reich . Why risk it all for a film you haven 't even seen ? Is it for him ? For your dad ? what do we do ? maybe I can draw the bounty hunter out of town . get you back home . not the way I drive . He doesn 't even want you . I 'm the one who killed that man . I 'm just as much involved as you are . Radio : San Francisco is buzzing with excitement this morning about the Crown Prince 's speech that will take place later today at the Nazi Embassy . It 's truly an historic event : addressing us in person- - [ Knock on door ] they 're expecting a record turnout . There are reports that excited citizens are traveling into San Francisco by the thousands ... - Going somewhere ? - What are you talking about ? Frank . and you 're not going to stop me . Not till you give me that gun . yeah ? Or what ? What the fuck are you doing ? until the Crown Prince 's speech is over . Ed . You 're not going to shoot me . no ? You don 't think I would shoot you to keep you from killing somebody else ? From killing yourself ? Frank . God damn it ! I 'm sorry ! I shot you . You wasted one of my bullets . God . Frank . Just give me the first aid kit out of the closet . Frank ! What are you doing ? Let me out ! Frank ! no . please ! Don 't ! Don 't do this ! Let me out ! Frank ! It 's weird . real good . which makes you a freak . It 's like too much of a good thing . You 're done . You 're flooding it ! Take your foot off the gas ! Leave her the fuck alone . I 'd be worried about myself if I were you . and you 'll be killing a Nazi agent . What ? I 'm working that girl . I need her alive . Why the fuck should I believe that ? Because I report directly to Obergruppenfuhrer Smith in New York . Why don 't you give him a call ? I 'll do that once I 'm through talking to the girl . You stay out of my way or I 'll kill you . [ " Back In The Saddle Again " by Gene Autry ] * Out where a friend is a friend * * Where the longhorn cattle feed On the lowly Jimson weed * * Back in the saddle again * * Ridin ' the range once more * yeah . I 'd better get you home . sir . Passport . That bus should be here any minute . Yeah . I 'm not getting on it . I can 't go back without answers . the bounty hunter could come back at any second . I know . I got to make a phone call . Juliana . I 'm going to check and make sure we didn 't leave any evidence behind . I have been informed that the Crown Prince and Princess will be arriving shortly . Please take your seats . Mr Shimura . A man of your stature should not be so far in the back . Oberfuhrer . I am quite content . I won 't hear of it . Come . Please come . Here . Right here . Sit . Excuse me . Sorry . Thanks . I 'm sorry . Hello . Ed ? Is that you ? Jules . you got to get back here . Frank 's about to do something terrible . you 've got to stop him . Please . What do you mean ? loyal subjects . Honored guests from the Nazi Reich . as they like to say here- - Howdy . All those who fought in the Great War that the world they sought to build would be a better one . But men are mortal and imperfect . through the looking glass of their limited perspective .

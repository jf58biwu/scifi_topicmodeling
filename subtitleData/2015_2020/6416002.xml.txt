 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... - Bobbi 's phone 's back in service . - Could be a trap . First person through this door ... Brains everywhere . You are leading them into a war . S.H.I.E.L.D. must be destroyed . Take her with you . Restrain her . Director Coulson , we are under attack from an unknown number of Gifted assailants . They have killed dozens of my men . We need your help . Now what ? Now , we begin . I believe Cal took these . I think it 's an ill-conceived attempt at super-strength . Uh-oh . Now it 's just you and me . This won 't hold me for long , Phil . It 'll hold you long enough . The hangar 's been emptied , locked down . It 's just us , Cal . To have a little chat ... When I get free , I 'll rip your voice box out of your throat . ... and try to come to our senses . Either we walk out of here together , or not at all . You got it ? We both want the same thing . What I want is to snap your spine like celery . See , I don 't think you really do . Well , let 's test your hypothesis . Oh , I think you 're willing to . But want 's a different thing . What we both want is to protect your daughter . You 're a family man . Who is sick of you sticking your nose in our business . It was your devotion to them that made you willing to do those terrible things all those years ago , - wasn 't it ? - Shut up . Nightmarish acts of violence that you didn 't want to commit , did you ? Your wife made you do it . You don 't know her ! You don 't know anything ! Say one more word and I 'll ... I 'm not saying your wife is a monster , Cal . I think you already know she 's a monster . What I 'm saying is , you 're not . I know you 've thought so for a long time . - But deep down , you 're a good man . - No , I 'm not ... I believe that . I do . You got a big heart ... Stop . ... full of love . You wear it on your sleeve . Skye got that from you ! No . That 's right . No ! Stop ! Stop ! You were just trying to save her . Trying to please your wife . No . No , I was trying to put my family back together ! I ... I reassembled her . Piece by piece . Sewed her back up . She was never the same . She was out for blood . Before Whitehall , an elder would sacrifice themselves every few decades so she could live on , carry on tradition . She would weep , scream , beg them not to . She had a good heart , Phil . She did . It was just torn out . And she needs to take lives to heal . So , you supplied them . Yes , a village of them . But it was never enough . She didn 't care about human life anymore . Even I had to change myself to be worthy in her eyes . I thought I could fix her , if I could just make good on my promise . I promised to protect our daughter . Does that include protecting your daughter from her ? You know Skye now . Her compassion . Jiaying 's out for blood and there 's no way in hell Skye will go along with that . Think about the danger that puts her in . She 's not my daughter , but she 's as close to family as I 've got . And I will save her , no matter what the cost . Please , let me help you . You want to lend me a hand getting these things off ? Or a face ? Mack ? Thank God . Who 's with you ? Just you and me , Tremors . Your people just took over the ship . About 100 or so prisoners . The rest are dead . Guess they 're not as harmless as you say . I swear , I never meant for any of this to happen . Then we need to stop them . But if you 're in here , I 'm guessing you figured that out already . It 's my mother , she 's manipulating them . Not all of these people are bad . They used their powers to kill S.H.I.E.L.D. agents , so I don 't give a damn about intentions right now . I came here because I need your skills . I can 't use my powers . They locked these Inhibitors on me . Not the skills I 'm looking for . Heard you have a history of hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D. That 's the fan room down on the fourth deck . All the ship 's air circulates through it . Take a case of Crystals down there , load the rest on the Quinjet . We have a problem ! I disabled the communication systems , but an emergency beacon was sent out to Coulson 's base . It 's hard-wired and there 's no way to cancel it without the proper code . Do one of you have the code ? I suggest you surrender peacefully . When Coulson gets the message , he 'll come at you with everything he has . Coulson 's being dealt with . I don 't need you to cancel the beacon . I want you to expand it . This ship and Coulson 's base aren 't the full extent of S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s operations . Expand the beacon , invite them all . You want them to know we 're here ? We have to show them what we 're capable of . It 's the only way they 'll ever leave us alone . We don 't know what you 're planning , but we 'll play no part in it . - Hands off , you freak ! - What are you doing ? Let him go ! Do you like rare gems ? You don 't think you can bribe me . It 's not a bribe . It 's an incentive . Expand the beacon , or there will be more . If we don 't cut that beacon , it 'll bring every available agent racing here . And she plans to do that to all of them . Yeah , the problem is , it 's hard-wired , clear on the other side of the ship , with a dozen ginger ninjas and God knows who else standing in the way . But we 're still gonna try ? Hell , yeah . Well , his physical changes have improved . Careful , I 'm a married man . Sorry , Phil . This looks expensive . We have a tab running . Sir , the carrier 's distress call has expanded to all channels . Jiaying used Cal 's distraction to take over that ship in minutes . Yeah , it 's intimidating . You get May and Hunter on the line ? We 'll need every asset we 've got to shut these Inhumans down . I tried , sir . Uh , their team 's already gone dark . There he is , poor sap . Not a clue what he 's walking into . I didn 't think May would be with him . She could screw the whole thing up for us . We 'll make sure Hunter and Bobbi get their reunion . By taking the rest out , one by one . Don 't worry about May . I 'll take care of her . I owe her that . Take that hallway . Check every room . Bob ? Bobbi ? Bob ? I 'm coming to find you , Bob . Bobbi ? Agent May ? Not really . Agent Walker took the south corner , right ? He still radio silent ? All agents , converge on the south corner . I 'll meet you there . Do not lower your guard until you see my face . Hunter 's the only agent left . She doesn 't know that . Bobbi . I 'm coming for you , Bob . Bob ! Come on . Stay with me , Bob . Come on , come on . Come on , Bob . Bob , Bob . Stay with me . Stay with me . Bobbi , Bobbi , stay with me . Please . Please . I got you . I got you . Baby . No . Kara ? No . No ! Kara , no . Kara ! Look at me . Look at me ! No , no , no . Kara ? Look at me , baby . Come on . It 's ... Oh , God . Oh , God ! Please ! Please , Bobbi . Come on . Help . We need to get her out of here . I 'm losing her . Easy , easy . Okay . Beautiful , isn 't it ? I don 't know about beautiful , but I 'm guessing it 's dangerous . In the wrong hands , lethal to our people . It 's better we have control over it . And what about us ? How dangerous are we ? Very . We 've always been . Now , they know it . What Jiaying did in there was ... That was murder . That was necessary . She 'll do whatever 's needed to protect our people . You know that better than most . Are you forgetting your life before we found you ? Of course I haven 't forgotten . Then you remember how far she went to save you , and know how far she will go to save all of us . We 're not doing anything that S.H.I.E.L.D. itself wouldn 't do . They have turned Jiaying 's own daughter against us . We have her locked up now , but given how lethal Skye is , it could get worse . You 'd be wise to remember that . She just killed them . All of ' em . Didn 't even think about it . Yeah , I thought my mom was bad when she started watching Fox News . And I fell for the whole act . Look , you had to choose between two ... This way . This way . You had to choose between two sides , that both mean something . I get it . You make the best choice you can . Sometimes it works out , sometimes ... - It didn 't . - It did not . Beacon 's in the sat room , down and to the left . Go get started . Try to hack the code and turn it off . Wait , where are you going ? To find a power saw in case you can 't . Sir ! Good news . I 've modified my field generators to act in unison as a Quantum Field Disrupter . Great , you 're saying you found a way to shut down Gordon 's teleportation ability ? Well , now my news sounds less good . Oh . Sorry . The Disrupter should keep him contained to a single space . I 'll take anything . We have Quinjets flying in from all over the world right now to answer the SOS with us . It 'll be nice to have something more to offer them than an encouraging thumbs up . What about Bobbi ? Landing any moment . Cal destroyed the lab . It 's unusable right now . This is our best option . We 'll make it work . Any update from May on Bobbi 's condition ? They 've slowed the bleeding . She 's holding on , but barely . We 'll see . Okay . And is Cal stable enough to join the mission on the carrier ? - Why would you want Cal ... - That doesn 't sound like a good idea . Gunshot wound to the upper back , exit wound in the chest . Pulse is 140 and weak . BP 's 60 over 30 . She stopped breathing just before we landed . I bagged her , got her going again . Hurry . One , two , three . Let 's get her prepped for surgery . CVC with dif chem-20 . Portable chest X-rays . Cross and type for two units . Yes , doctor . How 'd you get out ? Lincoln . I can explain . Don 't bother . You 've got this wrong . Very wrong . Listen , please . I just found you trying to reach out to your S.H.I.E.L.D. friends . You planning the next assault ? That attack didn 't happen , Lincoln . Jiaying staged the whole thing . She murdered Gonzales , then shot herself to frame S.H.I.E.L.D. , so we 'd follow her to war . Do you even hear how crazy that sounds ? Shot herself ? She 's already healed , hasn 't she ? I 'd tell you to ask Raina , she can see the future , but she 's not here , is she ? She 's not here because she had a vision of what happened , of what 's going to happen , and Jiaying couldn 't risk her talking , so she cut her throat . Why are you doing this ? Trying to turn us against her . You saw what she did with those Crystals . Killed unarmed agents . Okay , think . Why would she want the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. to come here ? It 's not to hug it out . She wants to execute them ! We can stop this . Please , just tell me where she took the Crystals . The fan room . Where the ship 's air ... Found a saw . I was getting through to him . Right now , I 'm in a crack-heads-first-ask-questions-later frame of mind . Here , hack that beacon , orjust cut it . I 'm gonna make sure those Crystals don 't hurt anyone else . Mack , you know what happens if one breaks near a vent . Near you . That 's why they won 't . Melinda ? I just wanted to hear your voice . You haven 't made a call like this since Bahrain . Yeah . Well , then I know it 's not good . You wanna tell me what 's going on ? How bad are we talking ? There 's no way it will end well . Andrew , there 's a lot I didn 't say , that I wish I did . Me , too . Do good , Melinda . And get home safe . You 'll be careful ? I won 't be careful , I 'll get the job done . Well , watch your back because I just saw Hunter with Bobbi , and it made me realize that , I ... Well , it 's just that ... We never really spoke about what you said to me at the bottom of the ocean . This ? Now ? You want to talk about this now ? No . We ... We don 't ... It means a lot to me that we 're friends again . And I , um ... Maybe when you get back , we could finally just talk about it ? It 's ... There 's nothing to discuss , Jemma . Maybe there is . Agent Fitz , we 're on the move . I 'd like to formally voice my doubts about bringing him on this mission . I understand your concerns , May , but Cal 's lived with the Inhumans . He knows what we 're getting ourselves into . We do not . He 's a loose cannon . Worse comes to worst , we let the cannon loose . Any distraction might help us take that boat . Look , Cal 's erratic , but if there 's one constant , it 's his concern for Skye . Sir , something 's happened with the SOS signal from the boat . I thought it was breaking up , like someone cutting the line . Radio interference ? No , but there 's a pattern to it . Like a code . It 's Skye . What 's she saying ? That it 's a trap . This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 218 , ordering all other forces to fall back . Repeat . Fall back . And what about us ? We 're gonna finish this . All the S.H.I.E.L.D. jets have turned around , except one . Someone must have warned them . Go check Skye 's cell . What do you wanna do with the rest of the prisoners on this ship ? If S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s not coming ... Then there 's no reason to wait . Break the Crystals , release the Mist . Either they 're Inhuman , or they 're dead . We don 't know the size of the force we 're up against , but priority one is saving the crew of the ship . Find them , free them . May , head to Operations , take control of the ship 's functionality . Sir ? Um , Skye 's last message came through . It reads , " Modified Crystals lethal . HVAC room . " She mean the Terrigen Crystals that release the Mist ? Yeah , but modified and lethal . And the HVAC room controls the ship 's ventilation . Ah ! So , that 's what this little mutiny is all about . Gas them all , see what shakes loose . - Not if I get to her first . - Oh , no , no , no . Not you , Phil . This is a family matter . My wife , my responsibility . You just find those Crystals and leave her to me . You brought him . All right , everybody . It 's Gordon , right ? And you are ? I 'm the guy who kills Gordon . I want you to remain behind , gather anyone who makes it through the Mist alive . What are you doing with those ? What I 've always done . There are descendants everywhere . I 'm going to find them and build them a better world . Where they 're not hunted , not afraid . And kill anyone in your way . Only if they 're in our way . Goodbye , Daisy . No , wait ! Come on , No-Eyes ! Show yourself . " No-Eyes " ? That is the best you can do ? Oh , you want clever ? Come a little closer , I 'll get real clever . You 're different than the others . I sense you 've encountered something Kree . - Wasn 't pleasant . - I can imagine . So , why don 't you put that thing down ? Avoid any further unpleasantness . I don 't think so . I 've seen what these Crystals can do . So if you want ' em , you 're gonna have to come get ... Hiya , honey . What you been up to ? You came back here . With them ? I know . I know what you 're thinking . I 've been thinking some thoughts of my own . Like , maybe we both kind of lost our heads . Get out of the way , Cal . No , you need to stop this . This isn 't about us or them . This is about our daughter . Think of what you are doing to Daisy . I 'm trying to protect her from the cruelty of this world ! Like you swore to . I know . I failed you . I failed you both . But we can turn this around . It is not too late . For you , it is . Where 's Daisy ? What did you do ? Where 's Daisy ? Where 's Daisy ? What the hell took you so long ? It 's a big boat , with poor signage . That no-eyed guy keeps popping in here , trying to get at these Crystals . - If he breaks them ... - Everybody 's a statue . We heard . Fitz ? On it . Here , take this . Thanks , but I 'll stick with the ax . Ricochets in here will be bad . And trust me , you will miss . Right . What are those things ? Quantum Field Disrupters . Should contain him here if he comes back . Of course . Why didn 't I think of that ? That 's okay . You 've been busy . And you 're not a quantum physicist . It 's completely understandable . Jiaying 's not the only one who can set a trap . You know , I batted over 400 in Little League . Hey ! My head still hurts . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know . You didn 't know . But now we have to stop Jiaying . Might help if we lose these . Hurry , there 'll be more redheads coming . I 'll go after her . Skye , I 'll do it . I 've done it before . - No . - You have to be willing to ... I won 't hesitate . Whatever it takes . Go . Damn it ! You sneaky son of a ... I hate this guy . - Fitz ! Hurry the hell up ! - Yeah , I 'm almost there . But I need him back in the room before ... Fitz , now ! Hit it ! I 'm trapped in here . That 's not possible ! What did you do ? Science , biatch . Looks like it 's batter up , Director . Mom ! Stop , you can 't do this ! No ! Put them on the jet and get ready for takeoff . I can 't let you leave with those Crystals . You can , and you should . It 's the only way to protect our people . It 's not . There are other ways . Whose ways ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ? No . Their way is what got us here . You started this war ! This war started decades ago , when S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded to guard the world against people like us . And it will never end . But you and I together ... Think of how powerful we could be . We could launch a revolution . Side by side . I don 't want your revolution . Because this isn 't about protecting me or your people . This is about hate . No , you 're wrong . It 's consumed you . You can 't even tell right from wrong ! I can 't let you destroy any more lives . My daughter . So beautiful , so strong . Mom , what are you ... I always believed the reason I endured all that torture and pain was for you . That you were my true gift . But you 're not . This is . Don 't do this . You made your choice . I 'm sorry . No ! They 're gonna keep coming . Not if we take out the source . Got her . We 're not bad , we 're misled . Atta boy , Turbo . Please , stop . You don 't have to do this . You don 't have to live with that pain . I will . Cal . What are you doing ? Keeping my promise . Ready to talk about it ? About what ? Your arm . Not yet . I 'm looking into some options . I 'd rather hear your evaluation of my team . Did you manage to get an accurate read on Bobbi ? I get pretty straight answers with morphine in the mix . Hey . - You look better . - Hmm . Stupid , but better . Taking a bullet for me was stupid . Walking into a trap when you know it 's a trap is stupid . You were the bait . Listen , Bob . Hang in there . There 's a long road . Surgery again tomorrow . And we haven 't started on your knee yet . But soon you 'll be stable , and then ... And then ... I can 't do this anymore . You convinced Mack not to quit . Yeah , well , he kind of owed me after cutting off my hand without asking . He respects you . But he still holds a deep distrust of all the alien artifacts you 've encountered . That 's why I put him in charge of them . You know , we could get better readings if we dropped a probe into the glass enclosure . Yeah , we 're never opening that damn box in 1,000 years . So , May asked for some time off , for the first time in the history of ever . Does that have anything to do with you being around these last few days ? You know I can 't discuss personal matters with patients . I 'm your patient now ? I wasn 't your patient the other night when you and your ex-wife snuck into my office and drank up half of my scotch . Yeah , it 's time May rediscover the world . Outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. , don 't you think ? That 's your report ? No , no , these are my recommendations for the new program . Are you bringing other people in on this yet ? Slowly . I got Fitz working on these designs . We 'll need to be mobile . Yeah , well ... Thank you . I 'm glad you think Skye 's ready for this . At this point ? I think she 's ready for anything . This is so long . For now . After all I 've done , I 'd be a fool to think I 'd get a Hollywood ending . Came close . I found you and got to ... You know , you 're better than I imagined . And I imagined you perfect . You 're way more interesting than that . I wonder where I get that from . Ah . It 's paradoxical , isn 't it ? My love for my family is what drove me mad . I know I 'm going away for good , but I was hoping you might come visit . Once in a while . I will . I promise . That would be ... Let me guess . The best day ever ? You have a lot of those . No . Just one . July 2nd , 1988 . Looks like you 're having trouble letting go . Hate to see that , my friend . Did she walk out on you ? She drowned when her lungs filled up with blood . These are all the names you could drum up ? You 're lucky we found this many . Whitehall , Strucker , List . The leadership is gone , man . Usually , a head grows back , but not this time . The organization , disintegrated . I want more names . And I wanna marry into money . Do you speak English ? No leadership means nobody giving orders , and that sure as hell includes you . You understand who you work for now ? Good . I 'm done flying solo . I miss having a team around me . I want more names . Hail HYDRA to that . What 's the plan , sir ? Chaos ? Closure . Oh ! Hey there , little funny face . You come in to see me today ? Hmm ? You come inside , we 'll get you a treat . Come on . Can I help you ? Just passing by . Nice place . Oh , thanks . Well , we 're just getting up and running . It 's gonna be a magical place once we get totally moved in . Yet we already have adoption days every Saturday . Tell your friends . Free spaying and neutering , too . Just ask for Dr. Winslow . I 'm sorry . You are ? Daisy . That 's a lovely name . Remember , a house is not a home without a pet ! Thank you for doing that for him . I know aspects of the T.A.H.I.T.I. program don 't sit well with you . This does . He has a lot to give . And now , a way to give it . And what about you ? Are you ready to refocus your energies ? A team centered around people with powers ? How many on the list ? Right now , just you . We 'll take it slow . I thought a lot about it . And ? And my mother was right about one thing . People like me need to be kept a secret . Not like the Avengers , out in the open . If we do this , we need to be ... Anonymous . That 's the idea . But it 's not " if we do this . " We have to do this . We don 't have a choice . It may feel like things have cooled down right now , but this ? This is my permanent reminder that we 'll always be paying the price . That we 'll never get ahead of the consequences that I , that you , that S.H.I.E.L.D. have set in motion . Like a ripple in the water . But this ripple won 't fade . It 'll grow and grow . Until it 's a tidal wave . No ! I don 't . You keep rambling on and on , and I still don 't know what you mean . Dinner . Fast approaching , yes . And we 'll eat it , I 'm sure . Yeah , no , no , no . But , uh ... Me and you , maybe we could eat somewhere else . You know , somewhere nice . Oh . Good . Okay . Uh ... Well , you should come find me when you 're finished here , and I 'll start working on options to run by you for that . Ugh ! What ... Oh !

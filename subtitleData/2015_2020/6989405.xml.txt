 Previously on " The 100 " ... There might be a fallout shelter built to sustain thousands . The second dawn . They built a bunker ? Their whole theology was based on riding out the end of the world . I have bad news , Abby . Black rain 's here . It 's worse than we thought . It burns on contact . It kills . We need a solution . We can 't create nightblood unless we go to space , but Luna can . We can inject ourselves with her bone marrow . Then we become nightbloods . The only way to know if it works is to test it . Who do we test ? Baylis . You don 't know what he did to me . I 'm gonna make him suffer for what he did to me and my brother . Wait . What if his death could save us all ? Hey . If this works , we survive . It 's as simple as that . Vital signs are strong . Jackson , seal the chamber . Copy that . He 's ready . Yeah . But are we ? The guy 's a monster . We 've been over this . None of us wants to do this , but the death wave will be here in 10 days . Luna 's stem cells grafted successfully . Baylis is making nightblood on his own . This really is our only hope . We really still talking about this ? Black rain is already here . 18 people died in it yesterday at Arkadia , so if nightblood can let us walk around in it , I , for one , want to know about that . Ok . Jackson , proceed . Copy that . Initiating . 500 rem . 850 . This is where we 'd see symptoms in a non-nightblood . BP is 100 over 50 . Body temp is 98.7 . Resting comfortably . No visible effects . 1,000 rem . 1,500 . All good here . 2,000 rem , the level of the black rain . Still nothing . It 's working . 2,500 . Wait . No . Turn it off . En 's sting in ! En 's sting in ! Aah ! Get him out of here . Wait . It 's not safe yet . What have we done ? I know it took courage to be outside with us today , to stand together now in the face of grave danger and grave tragedy . On the ark , rain like this was only a dream . Now it 's a nightmare , because we know it could turn at any second and kill us , just like it did to 18 of our brothers and sisters , who we honor today among them , Erin , Samuel , and Louis . May we meet again . May we meet again . Too many funerals , too little time . Show some respect for the dead . What for ? They don 't mind . Hey , where you going ? Wherever the day takes me . You got a chem tent ? Nope . Jasper . Jasper . No one leaves without a chem tent . Do you have a chem tent ? - Yeah . - Good . Then we have a chem tent . Maybe you didn 't see how those people died . I saw . I 'm just not afraid of it happening to me . Jasper , it 's not safe out there . What else is new ? Come on . We 're losing daylight . Jasper . Jasper . Damn it . Hey . Grow the hell up . Good . You 're coming . Yeah , but only because I don 't want to carry your body bag . Oh , come on . I 'm pretty light . I mean , I 'm wiry , but I 'm light . Kriken sonraun en branon . Kom graun , oso Na groun op . Kom folau , oso Na gyon op . That 's beautiful . What 's it mean ? From the earth , we will grow . From the ashes , we will rise . What did you just say ? Sorry . I didn 't think you would mind if I ... Niyah , " from the ashes we will rise . " Where does that come from ? Come from ? You 'd have to ask a fleimkepa . All I know is it 's what we say to ready our dead for the fire . It 's not a coincidence , Marcus . I need to speak with the flamekeeper . You already found the second dawn bunker . It was ... The wrong bunker . Cadogan said only those who reached level 12 would be saved . This is level 11 . What I found was a decoy built to keep the level 12 bunker from being overrun . How could you possibly know that ? Because that 's what I would do . And you think Indra 's daughter knows where the real bunker is ? I think there 's a reason " from the ashes we will rise " became a grounder prayer just like I think there was a reason that a corporate logo became their sacred symbol . The infinity sign . Yes . I can reach out to Indra . She might know where Gaia is . I 'll assemble a team . Thelonious , wait . Polis is a war zone . We won 't be welcome there . So we travel light . For this , we 'll need thinkers , not fighters . What 's going on ? Kane and Jaha need an engineer for a mission . Kane and Jaha ! Well , looks like someone 's moving up in the world . It 's just too bad in 10 days , there won 't be a world to move up in . How much have you had to drink ? Just the right amount . Harper . I get it . Duty calls . Hey , hey . Hey . We will find a way out of this . I have to go . So go . I 'll be here if you get back . When . I mean when . How 's the weather , Reyes ? Forecast still calling for death ? The stones of his ancestors . Abby , take a look at this . Of course . What is it ? Sodium polyethanol sulfonate . It 's an additive used to prevent clotting . Looks like the radiation broke it down and caused a chain reaction . What happens if we remove it ? We could save everyone . You could ? So you 're saying this can still work . Not without testing . The last guy just died , screaming in agony , and you want to try it again ? Give us a better idea , raven . Please . So what , we just go out there , hunt for someone else ? No one 's going anywhere in this storm . Then we wait for it to pass . When it does , there may not be anyone left to hunt for . Hunting for someone else to kill . What 's the matter with you people ? Even Baylis honored the dead . He wore the stones of his rock line ancestors . Who will honor him ? Wait . Baylis was sangedakru . He was . He was also a thief . He probably stole those stones . A thief who didn 't bear the mark of sangedakru . That wasn 't Baylis , was it ? Come on , Clarke . That 's crazy . Of course ... Who did we just kill ? - Hey , Emori ... - Emori , no ! Hey , hey , hey , hey . - Aah ! - Emori , go easy . John , take out the machine ! Don 't do anything stupid , Murphy . Looks like we know who 's next . I know it 's bad and everything is dying and all , but I 'm just gonna say it ... I don 't miss mosquitoes . Don 't miss them . This is all a big joke to you , isn 't it ? Now you 're getting it . That 's exactly what it is . One big cosmic joke . You 'd realize that , too , if you pulled the stick out of your ass . That 's enough . That is enough . I 'm just trying to help you . Oh , you 're trying to help me . That 's funny . It 's late . We 're leaving . Now . Damn it . Open your eyes ! The clock is ticking , and it has been since we landed on this terrible ... Beautiful planet . What the hell does that mean ? It means we are living on borrowed time , all of us . So if you know that , why are you throwing it away ? I 'm not . You are . What is the point in beating yourself up over all of the ... the crappy things you 've done ? You did them ! And ... and don 't say you had reasons , because at the end of the day , at the end of the world , nobody gives a damn about your reasons , because they are your reasons . No matter how much you punish yourself , it 's not gonna change anything . It 's not gonna bring anyone back . The way I see it is we can spend our last days wallowing in our reasons or we can do ... We can do whatever the hell we want ! Really mean it this time . Magic beans . Remember those ? Hallucinogenic nuts . That 's why you dragged me out here ? If you think I 'm taking those again , you really are crazy . Whatever the hell you want . Now you 're gonna lock us up ? What , she was just trying to save her own life . Well , we 're not gonna touch your stupid machine , all right ? Please , Clarke ! Can 't do this to us , raven , please . Don 't let them do this to us . Don 't let them do this to us . Please tell me you 're not actually considering putting Emori in that chamber . Mom , I don 't know what else to do . There is nothing else to do . We all know it . Abby , there has to be something that doesn 't make us murderers . Jackson and I have examined every possibility . And the only thing that we know for sure is that if we do nothing , we die . Jackson , prep Luna for the next extraction . No . You 've taken enough . Luna , it 's ok . We 'll sedate you . I said no . I won 't allow my blood to kill any more innocent people . Luna , please . Your blood is the one thing that can save us . My blood is a curse . It will , however , keep you from following me into the rain . Luna , you can 't , not with that hip . We can 't let you leave . We need you , Luna . Is there no line you won 't cross in order to survive ? Survival requires sacrifice . If the freikdreina dies ... Don 't call her that . If she dies saving the world , that is a good death . Luna , please . You 're wounded . And I don 't want to fight you . You have no choice . Remember ? Aah ! Sleep well , natblida . So you 're gonna strap her down and take her bone marrow ? Welcome to mount weather . Black rain . It fell here , too . I thought she was your friend . She is . That 's why we 're still alive . Wait here . Weapons down . Indra ... Thank you for meeting me . I didn 't know if you would . Oh ! Don 't smile at me , Kane . What do you want ? I 'm here . You have 30 seconds . After that , as the ally of my enemy , you are my enemy . Indra , you have to know that we had nothing to do with the attacks on your land or embassy . What I know is that Azgeda marched on Arkadia , and yet you made another alliance with them , a deal to save their people , not mine . I know how it looks , but , believe me , we 're still trying to find a way to save everyone . Then you are a fool . You 're fighting for a city that won 't exist in 10 days . What 's more foolish than that ? The radiation doesn 't care if you 're trikru or Azgeda . If we can 't come together to fight this enemy , then what hope is there for us ? The only hope we ever have : To die a warrior 's death . Indra , wait . Indra ! We need to speak to your daughter . She could be the one that saves us all . How ? Gaia , these men need your help . The tattoo . Look . The center . Still think it 's a coincidence ? Where did you get this ? Oh , I found it . And I now believe it 's so it could lead me to you . Tell us about the symbol . Where does it come from ? It 's the holy symbol of our order . Mother . Gaia , please . Skaikru helped you protect the flame . Help us now . It adorns the crypt of the first commander , Bekka Pramheda . Where is the crypt ? You think it 's the bunker ? It 's in the temple . Controlled by Azgeda , as are the tunnels . So how do we get in ? We fight . Indra . Like it or not , Azgeda is our ally . We have the royal seal . No one has to die . You 're assuming they 'll honor the seal . The closer we get to praimfaya , the less alliances seem to mean . How much faith do you have in yours ? First , we survive . Then we find our humanity again . I 'm sure they said the same thing in mount weather , too . You ok ? Are you ? Nightbloods . You 'd think I 'd have learned my lesson after Lexa . We 're doing the right thing . You sure about that ? Certainty 's a luxury leaders can 't afford . I 'm no king . Maybe not , but you were born for this . Lexa knew it , and so do I. You don 't back down when things get hard . It 's always hard . And yet here you are . I know you don 't believe it now , but one day , they will thank you for what you 're doing here . Murphy won 't . Emori won 't . If it works , they will . What if it doesn 't work ? Then we die knowing we did everything we could to save our people . Did you come up here to make me feel better ? It 's never been my strength . It 's ok ! I carry the seal of your king . Azgeda planhaka . Keep your head down . We agreed . They 'll let us pass . Weapons down . I 'm the skaikru chancellor . As your ally , we seek safe passage to the temple . They were letting us pass ! If there 's a bunker there , Azgeda will never see the inside . Come on , Marcus . It 's not our war . Roan will think that we did this . Be quick . Echo will send reinforcements . Where is it ? It 's beneath the altar . It 's here . I knew it . Help me . What does that mean ? It means " salvation lies within . " We were taught it referred to the ship that brought her to us . How do we open it ? Like every other lock , Mr. green . With a key . Uh ! No . Can you open it or not ? We have to . We need more time . Can you reposition your army at the temple ? If I do that , we lose the tower . The tower won 't save you . Neither will the ashes of the first commander , if that 's all that 's down there . Mother , please . I 'll move my guard detail to the temple door . Buy you some time . But I 'll need your guns . Just give her the damn guns , Marcus . I fear that jus drein , jus daun will be the end of us all . Gaia ... It would seem you should keep praying . Got it started without us . Got what started ? Fun . Come on . Everyone 's gonna die , Bellamy . We can go out like them ... Or like us . The ending 's the same , but who says the journey has to suck ? I come bearing fruit ! Jobi nuts are powerful medicine . You sure about this ? I 'm pretty sure . In that case , I recommend a tea . Teatime . Hey . Dance with me . I don 't dance . I don 't really want to dance . Come on . - Yes ! - Ha ha ! Good idea . Let someone else save the world for once . Ahh ! Yeah . John , enough . You can 't stop this . No . No , Emori . I 'm not letting this happen to you . You have to . What ? John , listen to me . Make them think you 're ok with this . We make Clarke think you 're still with her . Emori , I 'll kill her if she even thinks about hurting ... No . Damn it , John . Think . Don 't give them a reason to pick you next . Survive , please . It 's time . Guys , just wait , ok ? Hear me out . John . It 'll work this time . Then how about we just go with that and forget the test ? Miller ? Miller , don 't ... Miller ! Miller , I swear to god , I 'll kill y ... Miller , Miller , Miller , please . Miller , just look at me , man . You don 't need to do this . I wish that were true . You don 't have to do this ! Who the hell do you think you are , huh ? I 'm trying to save us . Save us ? Ah , right . Wanheda , savior of us all ! But maybe you 're forgetting the last time you saved us , I was saving you ! I 'm not forgetting . You haven 't forgotten ? Then , please , you don 't need to do this . Don 't do it . Please , please , you don 't need to do this . You know , it 's too bad that you weren 't a real nightblood because then you could have been commander . Imagine how many people you could 've killed then . Tell me something , after you murder Emori , am I next ? Ok ! I 'm begging you , please . I love her . Don 't do this . Emori will be fine . Hey . Look at me . If she dies ... You die . Waah ! Mom ... We have to do this . I can 't . I 'll finish it . I bear it so they don 't have to . Clarke . No . No . We 're testing me . It worked . It 's been two hours . How do you feel ? Ready . I won 't let you do it . Mom , I trust you . It 'll work . Turn it on . Jackson , don 't . Clarke ... If you go in there , you will die . I saw it . What are you talking about ? I saw it . Like I saw the rocket . We 're wasting time . - No . - Mom . - Wait . Abby . - Mom , don 't ! - Abby , don 't ! - Abby ! - Stop ! - Stop , Abby ! Don 't worry . It 'll all be over soon now . I can 't lose you . You 're ok . Come on . I told you , it has never been opened . It 's now or never . We were brought here for a reason , Gaia . Think . Is there another key ? It ... it would have a " 12 " on it . I 'm sorry , but we have to go . You should 've brought more guns . Then move your army into position . I will not give up the tower for the temple and a door you cannot open . Thelonious , we can come back . When , before or after the death wave ? Leave if you have to go . I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm staying , too . Maybe we are not worthy . Maybe we are meant to burn in praimfaya . No . We 're not meant to burn . We were meant to rise from the ashes . Wait . What is it , Monty ? " From the ashes we will rise . " What if it 's not just a motto ? What if it 's an instruction ? Do it . The 12th seal . Ready ? 1 , 2 ... Hold this temple . After you , my friend . Salvation lies within .

 ( GROWLING ) ( CHIRPING ) Boys , let 's do this ! ( KNOCKING ) KAREN : Gray ? Honey , what are you doing ? What is this ? Here . Let 's go . Come on , honey . Your flight 's in two hours . Dane County Airport is 36 minutes away , 60 with traffic . How many minutes to get your little butt in the van ? Hmm ? How many of those ? Feed the monster under your bed ? GRAY : Yes . Call me every day , and text me pics , so I don 't forget what you look like . I 'm only gonna be gone a week . SCOTT : Zach . You 're not going off to war here . Please . Come on . I will see you later . I love you . SCOTT : VÃ¡monos . Bye , okay ? Bye . KAREN : Are you in , buddy ? I know it hurts , sweetheart . Are you gonna be okay ? Everything right on there ? I 'm so jealous . You 're gonna have so much fun . I love you . I love you , too . Okay , great . All right , um , let 's give these to your brother , okay ? You hold these , please . Can you hold these ? Zach . Honey , I need you to take care of these . Yeah . SCOTT : Hey . KAREN : All right . Listen to your mother . KAREN : Take care of your brother . Answer your phone . I 'm serious . It 's the green button . When you see my name , push it , okay ? And remember , something chases you , run . Come on . All right . You 're funny . Okay , let 's go . Come on . Bye , guys . Bye . I miss you already . Yeah . So much for our last family breakfast . Why do you have to say things like that ? SCOTT : Did you call your sister ? Straight to voice-mail . SCOTT : It 'll be fine . She handles 20,000 people a day , right ? She can handle two more . GRAY : How big is the island ? Big . But how many pounds ? ZACH : That doesn 't make sense . GRAY : When they first opened , they had eight species . Now they have 14 herbivores and six carnivores . That 's 50 tons of food a week . WOMAN ON PA : Welcome to Isla Nublar , home of Jurassic World . We hope you have a safe and enjoyable stay with us . Where 's Aunt Claire ? MAN ON PA : Okay . Those of you in the front of the train Should be able to see our main gates . ( MAN ON PA CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) WOMAN ON PA : Please obey all park rules . Proper attire , including shoes and shirts , must be worn at all times . Your aunt arranged to greet you at 1 : 00 . Can he slow down ? Nope . Come on ! Your aunt 's got you VIP access , so you can get in all the rides without waiting in line . GRAY : Let 's go . Dude , she said we had to wait . I don 't wanna wait anymore . Hal Osterly , vice president . Jim Drucker , bad hair . Erica Brand , deserves better . Hal , Jim , Erica . Hal , Jim , Erica . And I am Claire . ( ELEVATOR BEEPS ) Three minutes late . ( SIGHS ) Welcome to Jurassic World . While year over year , revenue continues to climb , operating costs are higher than ever . Our shareholders have been patient , but let 's be honest , no one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore . Twenty years ago , de-extinction was right up there with magic . These days , kids look at a Stegosaurus like an elephant from the city zoo . That doesn 't mean asset development is falling behind . Our DNA excavators discover new species every year . But consumers want them bigger , louder , more teeth . The good news ? Our advances in gene splicing have opened up a whole new frontier . We 've learned more from genetics in the past decade than a century of digging up bones . So , when you say you want to sponsor an attraction , what do you have in mind ? We want to be thrilled . Don 't we all ? The Indominus rex . Our first genetically modified hybrid . How did you get two different kinds of dinosaurs to , you know ... Oh , Indominus wasn 't bred . She was designed . She will be 50 feet long when fully grown . Bigger than the T. rex . Every time we 've unveiled a new asset , attendance has spiked . Global news coverage , celebrity visitors . Eyes of the world . When will she be ready ? She already is . GRAY : Come on ! ZACH : Relax . Come on . Dude , chill . WOMAN ON PA : Welcome to the Innovation Center , where technology meets prehistory . ( BELLOWING ) MAN ON PA : The Triceratops can go horn-to-tooth with the apex predators . Literally meaning " three-horned face " in Greek , Triceratops is half as tall as T. rex ... as one-hundred trillion tons of TNT . ... turn its head back to look over its shoulder to better aim the swing of its dangerous tail . Cytosine , guanine , adenine , and thymine . The same four things in everything that ever lived . Hey , don 't wander off , all right ? Mom 's not paying me for babysitting . CLAIRE : Gray , is that you ? GRAY : Aunt Claire ! Okay , yeah . No , I 'm gonna have to go . My nephews are here . Hi . Oh . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , my gosh , you 're so sweet . Whoa , Zach . Last time I saw you , you were like ... That must 've been what ? Three , four years ago ? ZACH : Uh , Seven . Seven years , but , you know , close . So , I see you already got your wristbands . And this is for food . And Zara here is going to take great care of you until I 'm done working tonight , okay ? You 're not coming with us ? Oh ... I really wish that I could , but tomorrow I can take you into the control room , show you behind the scenes and all of that . That 's gonna be cool , right ? ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) Okay , so I will see you tonight at 6 : 00 . No , don 't forget you have the ... Right , of course . I will see you tonight at 8 : 00 . What time do you go to sleep ? Or do you go to sleep at different times ? ( CELL PHONE CONTINUES BEEPING ) Okay , so , have fun , and take very good care of them , okay ? Yeah . No , I 'm here . MAN 1 ON RADIO : It 's those two juvenile Triceratops . They 're going at it again . Should I tranq them , or are you coming over to take care of this ? MAN 2 ON RADIO : Go ahead and tranq them . MAN 1 ON RADIO : They 're running . What 's the live count ? 22,216 . Any incidents ? LOWERY : Yes . Six kids in the Lost and Found , 28 down with heatstroke ... Where did you get that ? Oh , this ? I got it on eBay . Yeah , it 's pretty amazing . I got it for $ 150 , but the mint condition one goes for $ 300 ... Didn 't occur to you maybe that 's in poor taste ? The shirt ? Yeah , no , it did . I understand people died . It was terrible , but that first park was legit . I have a lot of respect for it . They didn 't need these genetic hybrids . They just needed dinosaurs , real dinosaurs . Okay , please don 't wear it again . That 's kind of enough . Yeah , I wasn 't gonna . Did you close the deal ? CLAIRE : Looks like it . Verizon Wireless presents the Indominus rex . Ugh , that is so terrible . Why not just go the distance , Claire , and just let these corporations name the dinosaurs ? They 've got all the ballparks . Why stop there ? Why are the West Plains closed ? Another Pachy roaming outside his zone . But he 's fully sedated and ready for relocation . Pepsi-saurus or Tostito-don . Security said the invisible fences were a no-fail . That is the second time this month . VIVIAN : Well , the Pachys short out their implants when they butt heads . How much longer until they get it out of there ? He just got five milligrams of carfentanil . Yes , he 's very stoned . So why don 't we show a little sympathy ? I mean , you do understand these are actual animals , right ? Clean up your workspace . It 's chaotic . I like to think of it as a living system . Just enough stability to keep it from collapsing into anarchy . MAN ON RADIO : Inbound chopper , Jurassic 1 . ETA , 5 minutes . Claire . Mr. Masrani . You are flying . I got my license . Two more . Well , two more days . Okay . So , how 's my park doing ? CLAIRE : Great . We 're up 2.5 % over last year . A bit lower than our initial projection . No , no , no , how 's it doing ? Are the guests having fun ? Are the animals enjoying life ? Well , guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s . We don 't have a way to measure the animals ' emotional experience . Sure you do . You can see in their eyes . Right ? Of course . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay . Now show me my new dinosaur . ( GASPS ) MASRANI : Oh ... Got it . Got it . Oh , my ! You look tense , Claire . Maybe you should just focus on the controls . The key to a happy life is to accept you are never actually in control . Bird ! You should spend a day at the beach . Get some sun . Uh , right , so ... Marketing thought we could offset some of the costs by ... Enough about cost . John Hammond entrusted me with his dying wish , and not once did he mention profits . " Spare no expense , " he used to say . I appreciate that , but the reality of operating a theme park requires ... Don 't forget why we built this place , Claire . Jurassic World exists to remind us how very small we are . How new . You can 't put a price on that . Now , please , we 're flying . Breathe . ( GASPS ) Is he okay ? Are you okay ? He 's just being dramatic . Are you still building ? We planned to open in May , but Asset Containment insisted we build the walls up higher . It 's bigger than expected . It 's a good sign . We hit a few speed bumps early on . It began to anticipate where the food would come from . One of the handlers nearly lost an arm . The others threatened to quit if I couldn 't guarantee their safety . She 's intelligent then ? For a dinosaur . And that ? It tried to break the glass . I like her spirit . ( GROWLING ) It 's white . You never told me it was white . Think it will scare the kids ? The kids ? This will give the parents nightmares . Is that good ? It 's fantastic . Can she see us ? They say it can sense thermal radiation . Like snakes . I thought there were two of them . There was a sibling in case this one didn 't survive infancy . Where 's the sibling ? She ate it . ( SIGHS ) So , the paddock is quite safe , then ? We have the best structural engineers in the world . Yeah , so did Hammond . There 's an American Navy man here . Part of a research program one of my companies is running . Owen Grady . I know who he is . MASRANI : His animals often try to escape . They are smart . He has to be smarter . He only thinks he 's smarter . I want you to bring him in . Let him inspect the paddock . Maybe he sees something we can 't . ( MONKEY CHITTERING ) ( SQUEALING ) OWEN : Hold ! Hey ! Okay ! Eyes on me . Blue ? Blue ! ( CLICKER CLICKING ) Watch it . Charlie . Hey ! Don 't give me that shit ! Delta ! Lock it up ! Good ! And we 're moving ! Hold ! That 's good . That is damn good . ( CLICKER CLICKING ) Very good ! See , Charlie , that 's what you get ! Echo , there you go ! Delta ! Blue ? This one 's for you . Hold ! Eyes up ! Go . ( ALL LAUGHING ) You finally did it , man . HOSKINS : Owen . I was starting to think I hired the wrong guys , but , damn , you got them eating out of your palm . You came on a good day . It 's not usually a happy ending . Is that why you 're not sending in your reports ? We 've been busy . Not too busy to cash your paychecks . What do you need , buddy ? A field test . Hey . I 've just seen they can respond to commands . We need to take the research and get it on its feet . These are wild animals , Hoskins . Trust me , you don 't want them in the field . I just saw a bond . A real bond . Between man and beast . You 're in my way . Come on . We 're the same . We 're dogs of war . We know that the military needs to reduce casualties . Some people think that robots are the future . Look , nature gave us the most effective killing machines 75 million years ago . And now we know they can take orders . We finally make progress and that 's the first thing he says ? Make a weapon ? Shit . Come on , gents . It 's grown-up time . Drones can 't search tunnels and caves . And they 're hackable . The minute a real war breaks out , all that fancy tech is gonna go dark . But that tech 's not gonna eat them if they forget to feed it . Look at these creatures . They 've got millions of years of instinct in their cells , instinct that we can program . Their loyalty cannot be bought . These guys are gonna run straight into the enemy 's teeth and eat them , belt buckle and all . What if they decide they wanna be in control ? Well , then we remind them who is . We terminate the rogues . Promote only loyal bloodlines . ( SCOFFS ) What ? What 's so funny ? ( WHISTLES ) I don 't know . You come here and you don 't learn anything about these animals except what you want to know . You made them , and now you think you own them . We do own them . Extinct animals have no rights . They 're not extinct anymore , Hoskins . Exactly . We 're sitting on a goldmine . And Masrani is using it to stock a petting zoo . OWEN : He just wants to teach people some humility . He doesn 't make weapons . ( CHUCKLING ) You think that the eighth richest man in the world is only into oil , telecom , and family fun parks ? He 's so diversified , he doesn 't even know what he owns . How long has ingen been practicing this pitch ? Since the day we hired you out of the Navy . You knew the end game . These animals can replace thousands of boots on the ground . How many lives would that save ? ( BUZZES ) War is part of nature . Look around , Owen . Every living thing in this jungle is trying to murder the other . Mother Nature 's way of testing her creations . Refining the pecking order . War is a struggle . Struggle breeds greatness . Without that , we end up with places like this , charge seven bucks a soda . Do you hear yourself when you talk ? This is gonna happen . With or without you boys . Progress always wins , man . Maybe progress should lose for once . ( PIG SQUEALING ) MAN : Pig loose ! Pig loose ! ( SHOUTING ) ( GROWLING ) Owen , no ! No , hold your fire ! Hold your fire . Do not fire . Put 12 amps in these animals , they 're never gonna trust me again . OWEN : Blue , stand down . Stand down . Hey ! What did I just say ? Delta , I see you . Back up ! Okay . Good . Good . Charlie ? Stay right there . Good . Close the gate . Are you crazy ? Just trust me . Close the gate ! ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) I 'm okay . ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) Yeah . ( CHUCKLES ) You 're the new guy , right ? Yeah . You ever wonder why there was a job opening ? Hey . Don 't ever turn your back to the cage . ( GROWLING ) ( GROWLING ) Lift me up . I can 't see ! I 'm not Dad . And you 're not five . ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) GRAY : I can still ride the Triceratops . I 'm 47-and-a-half inches . This place is for little kids . Yeah , I know . Wanna go on the spinning dinosaur eggs ? Nope . Cover up your dork pouch . ZARA : Because it 's my wedding . No , Alec 's not having a bachelor party . Because all his friends are animals . Scatter . What ? Go . Run . Go ! ( GIGGLING ) Yuck ! ( INDISTINCT CHATTERING ) WOMAN ON PA : The next T. rex feeding will begin in 10 minutes . T. rex ! Come on , man ! Come on ! Okay . Let 's go ! WOMAN ON PA : Parents be aware , this show may be disturbing for smaller children . ( BELLOWING ) ( BRAYS ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hey , Mom . KAREN : You were supposed to call me when you landed . Are you having fun ? ZACH : Yeah , I guess . Aunt Claire gave us passes , so we don 't have to wait in line . Wait , she 's not with you ? ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hey , Karen ! KAREN ON PHONE : Hi , Claire . How 's it going ? Yeah , everything 's great . The boys are having fun . Everyone 's ... Yeah , everyone 's good . Really ? Because I just hung up with Zach , and he said that you weren 't even with them . ( SIGHS ) Yeah , look . Today turned out to be a really bad day for me . They 're in great hands . They 're with my assistant . She 's British , so they invented nannies . Wait , are you crying ? This was supposed to be a family weekend , Claire . You haven 't seen the boys in forever . And I know how Zach will treat Gray if they 're by themselves . And he can just be so mean . Okay , I 'm sorry . Tomorrow , I 'm gonna spend the entire day with them . I 'm going to take off work , and I will not leave their side . I promise . Well , a promise tomorrow is worth a lot less than trying today . Ew ! You 're using Mom 's lines now ? Oh , my God . I am using Mom 's lines . I 'm sorry , but you know , I have to tell you , they work . You 'll see when you have kids . Yeah , " if . " " When . " It 's worth it . Bye , Mom . Bye . What do they want now ? CLAIRE : Mr. Grady ? I need you to come take a look at something . Why are you calling me Mr. Grady ? Owen . If you 're not too busy . I 'm pretty busy . We have an attraction . That 's not what you said the last time I saw you . I 'm talking about the dinosaurs , Mr. Grady . Owen . A new species we 've made . ( FLY BUZZING ) You just went and made a new dinosaur ? Yeah , it 's kind of what we do here . The exhibit opens to the public in three weeks . Mr. Masrani wanted me to consult with you . You wanna consult here or in my bungalow ? That 's not funny . ( LAUGHS ) A little funny . We 'd like you to evaluate the paddock for vulnerabilities . Why me ? I guess Mr. Masrani thinks , since you 're able to control the Raptors ... It 's all about control with you . I don 't control the Raptors . It 's a relationship . It 's based on mutual respect . That 's why you and I never had a second date . Excuse me ? I never wanted a second date . Who prints out an itinerary for a night out ? I 'm an organized person . What kind of a diet doesn 't allow tequila ? All of them , actually . And what kind of a man shows up to a date in board shorts ? It 's Central America . It 's hot . Okay . Okay . Can we just focus on the asset , please ? The asset ? Look , I get it . You 're in charge out here . You gotta make a lot of tough decisions . It 's probably easier to pretend these animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet . But they 're not . They 're alive . I 'm fully aware they 're alive . You might have made them in a test tube , but they don 't know that . They 're thinking , " I gotta eat . " I gotta hunt . I gotta ... " You can relate to at least one of those things . Right ? I 'll be in the car . You might want to change your shirt . They 're very sensitive to smell . WOMAN ON MICROPHONE : The Mosasaurus was thought to have hunted near the surface of the water where it preyed on anything it could sink its teeth into , including turtles , large fish , even smaller Mosasaurs . Okay , folks , let 's see if she 's still hungry after already eating today . She 's a little shy , so be nice and give her a hand when she comes out . Zach , Zach ! The Mosasaurus ! ( GROWLING ) ( ALL GASPING ) Oh , my God ! That was awesome ! WOMAN : Hold on tight . We 're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus . It had 88 teeth ! ( LAUGHS ) Wanna see something else cool ? Yeah ! CLAIRE : We 've been pre-booking tickets for months . The park needs a new attraction every few years in order to reinvigorate the public 's interest . Kind of like the space program . Corporate felt genetic modification would up the wow factor . They 're dinosaurs . Wow enough . Not according to our focus groups . The Indominus rex makes us relevant again . ( CHUCKLING ) The Indominus rex ? We needed something scary and easy to pronounce . You should hear a four-year-old try to say " Archaeornithomimus . " You should hear you try to say it . So what 's this thing made of ? The base genome is a T. rex . The rest is classified . You made a new dinosaur , but you don 't even know what it is ? The lab delivers us finished assets , and we show them to the public . Can we drop a steer , please ? How long has the animal been in here ? All its life . Never seen anything outside of these walls ? We can 't exactly walk it . And you feed it with that ? Is there a problem ? Animals raised in isolation aren 't always the most functional . Your Raptors are born in captivity . With siblings . They learn social skills . And I imprint on them when they 're born . There 's trust . The only positive relationship this animal has is with that crane . At least she knows that means food . So , she needs a friend . We should schedule play-dates ? That sort of thing ? Probably not a good idea . Where is it ? Is it in the basement ? Is there a downstairs ? Maybe it 's in the rec room . It was just here . We were just here . ( BUZZING ) GUARD : Oh , shit . That doesn 't make any sense . These doors haven 't been opened in weeks . Were those claw marks always there ? Do you think it ... Oh , God . She has an implant in her back . I can track it from the control room . We have an asset out of containment . Put ACU on alert . This is not a drill . LOWERY : Even though I didn 't meet him until I was 13 , I definitely consider Carl to be more of a dad than my real dad . ( BEEPING ) ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Yeah , hello ? CLAIRE : Lowery . Get me coordinates on the Indominus . Okay , yeah . I 'm doing it right now . GUARD : That wall is 40 feet high . Do you really think she could have climbed out ? It depends . On what ? What kind of dinosaur they cooked up in that lab . LOWERY : Wait , what the hell ? ( BEEPING ) It 's in the cage . No , that 's impossible . I was just there . Claire , I 'm telling you , she 's in the cage . Wait a sec . There are people in there . ( GASPS ) Get them out of there now . Now ! Paddock 11 , this is Control . You need to evacuate the containment area . VIVIAN ON RADIO : ( DISTORTED ) Paddock 11 . Paddock 11 , do you copy ? Yeah , what 's the problem ? It 's in the cage ! It 's in there with you ! Go ! ( WHIMPERS ) ( GROWLS SOFTLY ) ( MAN SHOUTING ) MASRANI : Close the door . ( ALARM BEEPING ) We can 't lock him in there with that thing . Close it now ! CLARE : Somebody talk to me ! What is happening ? ( GROWLING ) Shit ! ( WHIMPERING ) ( GROWLING ) ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR BEEPS ) Everyone remain calm . The implant will shock it if it gets too close to a perimeter fence . Okay . It 's moving really fast . This is Control . Put out a park-wide alert . Hang up that damn phone , please . Sorry , I 'm getting new information . Everything 's fine . Let Asset Containment capture it quietly . The very existence of this park is predicated on our ability to handle incidents like this . It was an eventuality , okay ? You should put that in the brochure . " Eventually , one of these things will eat somebody . " That paddock is four miles from the closest attraction . ACU can handle this . No one else is gonna get ... Eaten ? MAN ON RADIO : To all units . This is a non-lethal operation . Understood ? ( BEEPING ) ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) HOSKINS : How fast can they run ? Forty . Fifty when they 're hungry . Ooh ! You ever open them up , see what they can do ? No . ( LOUD THUD ) Oh , shit ! ( LAUGHS ) That got me . It got me . What do you think ? Want to take one home ? Hey , don 't joke . When I was your age , I rescued a wolf pup . ( GROWLING ) It was , like , two months old . It could barely walk . It used to sleep by my bed . Watch over me . My wife , she came at me with a steak knife . It took a chunk out of her arm . Did you put him down ? Hell , no . We had an unshakeable bond , you know ? Just like you and ... What 's his name ? Delta . And she 's a girl . Can I ... ( SHUSHING ) Oh , wow . ( BEEPING ) ( SPEAKING IN FRENCH ) Code 19 ! MAN 1 : That 's the new one ! They said we lost two guys ! HOSKINS : What 's a Code 19 ? MAN 2 : That 's Indominus ! Asset out of containment . These people , they never learn . They 're gonna learn all kinds of things about their new asset now . Hey . Yeah , it 's me . We might have an opportunity here . You guys been here before ? If Mom and Dad get divorced , will one of us be with Mom and the other with Dad ? What ? Why would you say that ? Because they are . No , they 're not getting ... They 're not getting divorced . Look . You haven 't been around long enough . They 've always been that way . They get mail from two different lawyers . That doesn 't mean anything . I googled . They 're divorce lawyers . All right , whatever . You know what ? It doesn 't matter , okay ? I 'm gonna be gone in two years anyway . I mean , all my friends parents are divorced . ( CRYING SOFTLY ) Hey , knock it off . You 're gonna cry ? Look . You 're gonna get two of everything , right ? You 're gonna get two birthdays , two Thanksgivings , two ... I don 't want two of everything . Yeah , well , it 's not up to you . All right ? There 's a point you have to grow up . ( GROWLING ) ( DOOR BEEPS ) GUARD : I need to see a badge . Sir , I need to see a badge . What the hell happened out there ? Sir . There are thermal cameras all over that paddock . She did not just disappear ! ( SIGHS ) It must have been some kind of a technical malfunction . Were you not watching ? She marked up that wall as a distraction . She wanted us to think she escaped ! Hold on . We are talking about an animal here . A highly intelligent animal . 400 meters to the beacon . You 're going after her with non-lethals . We have $ 26 million invested in that asset . We can 't just kill it . Those men are gonna die . VIVIAN : 300 meters to the beacon . OWEN : You need to call this mission off right now . LOWERY : They 're right on top of it . Call it off right now . You are not in control here ! ( DISTANT BEEPING ) ( BEEPING ACCELERATES ) Blood 's not clotted yet . It 's close . What is that ? That 's her tracking implant . She clawed it out . CLAIRE : How would it know to do that ? She remembered where they put it in . ( SQUEALING ) ( TWIGS SNAPPING ) ( GROWLING ) It can camouflage ! ( SCREAMING ) ( BEEPING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SHOUTING ) ( BEEPING ) ( GROWLING ) ( BEEPING ) ( MAN SHOUTING ) ( BEEPING ) Evacuate the island . We 'd never reopen . You made a genetic hybrid , raised it in captivity . She is seeing all of this for the first time . She does not even know what she is . She will kill everything that moves . Do you think the animal is contemplating its own existence ? She is learning where she fits in the food chain , and I 'm not sure you want her to figure that out . Now , Asset Containment can use live ammunition in an emergency situation . You have an M134 in your armory . Put it on a chopper and smoke this thing ! We have families here . I 'm not gonna turn this place into some kind of a war zone . You already have . Mr. Grady , if you 're not gonna help , there 's no reason for you to be in here . ( CLATTERING ) I would have a word with your people in the lab . That thing out there , that 's no dinosaur . ( MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO ) CLAIRE : Okay . I 'm going to close everything north of the resort . This is a Phase One , real world . Bring everyone in . This is a Phase One , real world . I repeat , this is a Phase One . Bring everyone back in . GRAY : Did you know the soft tissue is preserved because the iron in the dinosaur 's blood generates free radicals , and those are highly reactive . So , the proteins and the cell membranes get all mixed up , and act as a natural preservative . DNA can survive for millennia that way . See , now , even if the amber mines dry up , they 'll still have bones ... Shut up . What do you think 's gonna happen from you just staring at them ? ( GIGGLING ) Thanks , man . You 're welcome . Enjoy the ride . MAN ON PA : Pregnant women and those who suffer from motion sickness should consult with a doctor before riding this ride . Enjoy the ride . ( RINGING ) Hello ? Seriously ? Sorry , folks . The ride is closed . ( ALL CLAMORING ) Everyone needs to proceed to the monorail and exit towards the ... ( ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) Come on , guys , I just work here . WOMAN ON PA : Due to technical difficulties , all our exhibits are now closed . ( WOMAN ON PA SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE ) DR. WU : You know that I 'm not at liberty to reveal the asset 's genetic makeup . Modified animals are known to be unpredictable . It 's killed people , Henry . That 's unfortunate . What purpose could we have for a dinosaur that can camouflage ? Cuttlefish genes were added to help her withstand an accelerated growth rate . Cuttlefish have chromatophores that allow the skin to change color . It hid from thermal technology . Really ? How is that possible ? Tree frogs can modulate their infrared output . We used strands from their DNA to adapt her to a tropical climate . But I never imagined ... Who authorized you to do this ? You did . " Bigger . " " Scarier . " Um ... " Cooler " I believe is the word that you used in your memo . You cannot have an animal with exaggerated predator features without the corresponding behavioral traits . What you 're doing here ... What you have done ... The Board will shut down this park , seize your work , everything you 've built . And Hammond won 't be there to protect you this time . All of this exists because of me . If I don 't innovate , somebody else will . You are to cease all activities here immediately . You are acting like we are engaged in some kind of mad science . But we are doing what we have done from the beginning . Nothing in Jurassic World is natural . We have always filled gaps in the genome with the DNA of other animals . And , if their genetic code was pure , many of them would look quite different . But you didn 't ask for reality . You asked for more teeth . I never asked for a monster ! " Monster " is a relative term . To a canary , a cat is a monster . We 're just used to being the cat . Hey , there . I 'm Jimmy Fallon . Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere , an amazing machine made possible by science . Your safety is our main concern . Which is why you 're behind our invisible barrier system , which protects you from things like Dilophosaurus venom . One drop of this can paralyze you , so watch out . Is this real ? It is ? And for added protection , each vehicle is surrounded by aluminum oxynitride glass . So tough , it can stop a .50-caliber bullet . ( CLATTERING ) The Gyroscopic technology will keep you upright at all times ... Where are they ? ... so you 've got nothing to worry about . Oh , man . ( GRUNTING ) ( LOUD GROWLING ) ( MONITOR BEEPING ) WOMAN : Due to technical difficulties all our exhibits are now closed . Please disembark all rides and return to the resort . ( SIGHS ) Come on , we can stay out a couple more minutes . But they said it was closed . Aunt Claire gave us special wristbands , right ? We 're VIP , dude . Come on . It 'll be fun . ( ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( DIALING ) ( LINE RINGING ) ZARA : Hello ? Zara . I need you to bring the boys back to the hotel right away . I don 't know ... I 've been looking everywhere for them . It 's just been quite a while . Slow down . I can 't hear you . Zach and Gray , they 've run off . They what ? ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hey , Claire . Zach , thank God . Is Gray with you ? I can 't really hear you . We 're in the hamster ball . Okay . Zach , listen to me . ( DISTORTED ) I need you to ... Hello ? Zach ? Hmm . Are there any Gyrospheres left in the Valley ?

Our emergency measures just put all the warm bodies in one place . Sir ... InGen Hoskins . I know who you are . Then you know why I 'm here . I 've been working for two years on an application for those Raptors . They can hunt and kill that creature . But your program was to test their intelligence . Yeah , it was . And we did . And in the process , we learned something . They follow orders . You see , the solution to your crisis is standing right in front of you . Let me be as clear as I can . No Velociraptors are going to be set loose on this island . Oh , shit . You 're out of your mind ! What are you going to do with all these people ? You got 20,000 people here .

( SCREECHING ) Lowery , I 'm on my way back to you . LOWERY : ( WHISPERING ) That 's a bad idea . The board assigned emergency ops to iNGen 's private security division . This guy Hoskins is in charge . ( KNOCKING ) And he has this insane plan to use the Raptors to hunt the Indominus . What do you mean " use the Raptors " ? Son of a bitch !

How many more people have to die before this mission starts to make sense to you ? It 's not a mission . It 's a field test . This is an ingen situation now . Okay , there are gonna be cruise ships that show up here at first light . Everybody 's gonna get off this island . You 're gonna watch a news story tomorrow about how you all saved lives .

We know that she is in sector five . This is a game we call hide-and-seek . It 's a scent drill . We 've done it about a thousand times with these animals . When they get on target , and they will get on target , wait to engage . Velociraptors are pack hunters . They like to herd the animal into a kill zone . That 's when we take our shot . Get a clear shot , wait on my command , and give her everything you got . We got one good target , gentlemen . Do not shoot my Raptors . Please . ( GROWLS SOFTLY ) Easy , Blue . Easy . Attagirl .

We have to learn Joe . Juliana Crain is not a suitable choice for romance . Joe . An enemy of the state . And so are you if you try to protect her . We should have put a bullet in your brain already . Joe ? You can use your budding romance in the services of the Fatherland . Our sources in San Francisco tell us a new film has been found . Find Juliana Crain . Find the film . I 'll be prepared to accept that you 've learned from your mistakes . the girl dies with you . Is that clear ? sir . - Good . Call her . That 's her number .

Thanks . - Mm-hmm . Take care . right ? Said I was going crazy . he just said he was worried about you . What 's going on ? I didn 't want to tell you because I didn 't want you to worry . I got it into my head that we lost your sister . I got the same feeling I had when your father died . This tight knot in my gut . and I knew he was gone . but then I woke up this morning ... just like that . just like nothing ever happened . So everything 's okay . Do you want some coffee ? - Joe ! - Hey ! buddy . How you doing ? - Better now . - Yeah ? Everything okay ? some kids down the block were teasing him because he doesn 't have a dad . right ?

I 've learned you have in your employment Juliana Crain . Yes . That 's correct . She is the sister to a known subversive . Thank you for the information . I will take it seriously . There is no doubt about it . to save you from embarrassment . Chief Inspector . The responsibility for the girl and all her actions lies with you . Miss Crain . Trade Minister . I apologize . I have caused you embarrassment . I should have told you and I will resign . Or you will dismiss me . No . In life there are too many questions with a lack of time to answer them . You may not understand this . 000 year-old book . I ask it questions as if it were alive . It is alive . It tells me you have a purpose . It says superior person in an inferior position . Accepting a task graciously brings good fortune to all . Miss Crain . We cannot see ahead alone . my wife and I. We ... We grew flowers . I 'm sorry for your loss . Please . Send this to the personnel department to add this room number to your clearance . why do you disregard Chief Inspector Kido 's warning ? What do you owe this woman that you would risk so much for her ? Find out about her sister . All right ! Listen up ! Bob ? Hey ! Everybody 's going to be sent home early . so just form a line right here . Then they 're going to shake down the factory . get out of here . From the Trade Minister . Juliana .

Kempeitai are turning over the factory . listen . pick some stuff up . Just don 't go far . Here you go . Why are they doing that ? I 'm not sure . How are you doing ? last night helped . Thanks . But the truth is I don 't know . I understand . I have to say I don 't understand you . Yeah ? Why is that ? but you raise them Jewish ? That 's right . I know you get how dangerous that is for you and for them . I 'm not going to pretend that it 's easy . I struggled with it for a while . But ... this is who I am . This is who my ancestors were . I 'm not going to let them take that away from me . And you think it 's worth dying for ? but you can 't live your life in fear . in Boston . Jesus . Frank . lynch mobs were murdering Jews because suddenly we were less than human . What did you do ? those of us who came out in one piece . and we vowed revenge . got kids to raise . And Hitler and the Nazis ... I don 't care how it looks . They won 't last . One thing I realized about my people is we 've got a different sense of time . but we 'll survive . We always do . You 've just got to find something to hold on to . faith . I don 't have any of that . what about art ? You 're supposed to be an artist . Why are you making fake guns ? Because no one wants to buy my art . So do it for yourself . Frank . It gives us hope . I don 't know . I don 't know where it would get me . Yeah . Right . You don 't need anybody to keep you down because you got your own little inner fascist right there telling you what you can and cannot do . That 's how you let them win . I can source that metal for you . Bud . Joe . are you ? No . Of course not . I wouldn 't do that to you and Buddy . Arigato . [ speaking Japanese ] Robert Childan here to see the Kasouras . [ knock on door ] you look [ speaking Japanese ] I 'm afraid I may be early . Not too early . Mr. Childan . to invite your most favorable attitude . Most kind of you . Selected from the finest objets d 'art of America 's dying culture . a flavor of our bygone days . Flappers used to wear them in the 1920 's . I saw you looking at them in the store . but still ... Thank you . a drink ? Whiskey ? Mr. Kasoura . Tasteful . Oh . Very tasteful . the harmony . Kasoura-san . call me Paul . And Betty . Then I am Robert . Mm . Is this your collection ? Would you like to see it ? yes . Thank you . The pistol is our prized possession . Colt .44 from 1860 . Issued to the Union Army . Boys in blue brought it into the second Bull Run . Please . Thank you . how do you verify what 's real from any fakes ? I have a practiced eye . What a wonderful sense of history it exudes . Betty : Dinner is ready . Shall we ? What the hell do you think you 're doing snooping around the Nippon Building ? please . I could say the same to you . What choice do you think I had ? I had a family to support . How do you think I kept all of you safe ? and I did what I had to do . Did you have any idea that your sister was involved with these insurgents ? I heard her on the wire . So did all the other listeners . I had to throw myself on the mercy of ... our benevolent employers . I had to identify her . I told them she was a kid . I told them she was my kid . I worked for them for 16 years . It 's got to be worth something . 16 years ? Did you know she had a film ? No . She did . And now there 's another one . you listen to me very carefully . You cannot get involved in this . isn 't there ? but I can tell you they got us working around the clock trying to find it . I thought they were going to shoot us both . so they let her and that idiot boyfriend of hers escape to the Neutral Zone . because if anything happened to Trudy ... I 'd be finished . this steak is delicious . We like to eat American food . Betty . Thank you . do you like music ? Hmm ? Kid Ory ? Dixieland jazz . I 'm afraid I 'm not familiar with Negro music . sometimes Bach . Perhaps if I played you a selection from the New Orleans Rhythm Kings . he does not know it . yesterday I saw an American say to his friend is it not ? yes ... And " old " is also impolite . and we address strangers as friends - to show we 're angry . - Ah . " pal " or " buddy . " back off . it 's confusing . really . Subtle . perhaps you can help me with a book I 'm reading . It 's a novel from the 1930 's by U.S. author Nathaniel West . The novel is Miss Lonely-hearts . but I can 't seem to grasp the author 's meaning . I fear . Hmm . What a shame . who believe there must be sin to account for it . Mr. West suggest due to his being a Semite . then Semites would be running the world today . you would agree would be most ... [ ring ] [ ring ] [ ring ] Hello . Joe . It 's Juliana . Is this a good time ? Yeah . I couldn 't talk from home . The lines are tapped . I 'm sorry I didn 't get a chance to say goodbye . That 's okay . Don 't worry about it . So how you been ? okay . Did you hear anything about this new film ? What do you know about it ? just rumors that there is one . yeah . Not much . uh ... just there 's something different about this one . What do you mean ? Different how ? I don 't know . Um ... Joe ? What 's your news ? [ beep beep ] Operator : Please insert more coins . or just give me your number there . [ speaks Japanese ] Please insert more coins . [ dial tone ] Hello ? Hello ? Who is she ? She 's no one . It doesn 't matter . I have to go out . closes ] Mr. Childan . I did . Thank you . um ... it 's still early . you see . so there 's much that is strange . to the Japanese way of life . next time you must come to me . dinner next week ? I can make rice and miso soup . but thank you for your time tonight . uh ... then ? It was instructive . Thank you . Instructive ? Of course . I hope I 've proved a useful research opportunity . Arigato for your hospitality . " Did you hear anything about this new film ? " yeah . Not much . " uh ... " " just there 's something different about this one . " - " Different how ? - I don 't know . " how ... " You think she knows more about the film - than she 's saying ? - Yes . Absolutely . sir . Different to the others . Joe ? using her contacts there ? Maybe . I don 't know . Perhaps you 're going to have to help her . and you 'd better hope you find that film . You call in every day . everything . no mistakes . I noticed yesterday you were very good with my little girls . Is that because of ... Buddy ? [ pat pat ] hmm ? What do you want ? I 've got a proposition for you . How about I make you guns to sell ? We split the profits 50-50 . Get out of here . don 't make out that you 're above it . You sold me bullets . What 's wrong with guns to fire them from ? look . and then it 's done . pal . and fake guns aren 't my thing . how good a craftsman are you ? how good ? I 'm good . Real good . Could you make this ? Because I 've got a chump lined up to buy it . Japanese . Their brains are different . ersatz as the day is long . Condescending bastards look down on me . Here . Look at this . Two Zippo lighters . don 't they ? hold them . One of them has " historicity " in it . What the fuck is that ? 000 yen on a collector 's market . Don 't you feel it ? 000 ? One of those two Zippo lighters was in Franklin D. Roosevelt 's pocket so it 's got historicity as much as any object ever had . And the other one has nothing . That 's your point ? It 's all a giant racket ? And they 're playing it on themselves . and it 's just the same as if it hadn 't in the mind . So who 's to say our jeweled choker isn 't Sitting Bull 's original ? so which one is it ? This one . Won 't he spot that it 's a fake ? The man 's already got a forgery in his esteemed collection : He can 't distinguish what 's fake from what 's real . Let 's screw him over . 000 yen split two ways . Just make sure it looks good enough . 60-40 . I got materials to cover . [ door closes ] [ footsteps ] - Jules ? - Yeah . Where have you been ? I was with Arnold . so I had to go and talk to him . What did he say ? He said ... that he did it to support us . And that he thinks he saved Trudy . He thinks he 's the one who got the Japanese to let her go to the Neutral Zone . Did you tell him she 's dead ? No . What 's wrong ? I saw Trudy . and I saw her . You saw the pons shoot her . but I ... I saw her . we have to get out of here . The Kempeitai came to the factory today looking for the shooter . Do you think they were looking for you ? Ed told me they didn 't ask for anyone by name . I got out before they saw me . the Kempeitai won 't let this go I have to get out of here . either . we go to the Neutral Zone ? Yeah . You 've got to trust me . Frank . What if she is still around somehow ? Jules . She 's gone . Trudy Walker . We don 't know what she was involved in ? Trade Minister . even though I told you nothing . Your compassion has placed me under your debt . You have a sister : Trudy Walker . She ... You know she 's missing . It 's not easy . I have to tell you . She 's dead . uh ... how do you know ? I was given information by Japanese authorities . I 'm sorry . Did they tell you anything ? Where she is ? Her body . It 's a horrible place to see . truth is of the highest importance and only with the truth can one move forward . ask her to forgive us . And bid her spirit to cross the river to Anoyo on the other side . [ speaking Japanese ] Thank you . [ airplane zooms ] Taxi . You wait ! Japanese go first !

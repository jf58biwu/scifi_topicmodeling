 Please help me . My name is James Holden , speaking for the five survivors of the Canterbury . Our ship was destroyed answering a bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli . We recovered a false beacon and identified it as Martian Naval technology . It was a trap . Torpedo launch ! Those weren 't meant for us . Canterbury , burn like hell . You got incoming . Juliette Andromeda Mao . You crewed her up on a ship called the Scopuli . That would explain your interest in her , huh ? Sayonara , Ceres . That 's my going-away present to you . Onto bigger and better things . We 're gonna retire to Mars and the Mariner Valley Circle of Life . My diplomatic credentials have been revoked . I 've been banned from Mars for life . Frank Degraaf was found dead in his home this morning . Suicide . I 'm so sorry . This is the ship . The one that killed the Cant . It has to be . Someone forced their way out of this . Holden , behind you ! I think it 's absorbing energy from the reactor . Anyway , what do you know about this kid ? Why she 's on Eros . I believe in her . You 're going to Eros , aren 't you ? Let me help you find him . I 'm looking for a friend who checked into a room here . Lionel Polanski . Hey ! Shit just follow you around , don 't it , kid ? Who the hell are you ? And what are you doing here ? Julie ? Everything going on out there , all this shit storm that we 're in , it 's all got to do with her , Julie Mao . You know that memory crypt that we took out of that stiff ? Yeah ? All right . Go 3-D . It had an unregistered flight path for a ship called the Anubis . The Anubis left Phoebe Research Station , and it was headed for Eros , okay ? Now , I 'm thinking , hmm , maybe something 's being transported on this ship . I 'm thinking Julie 's ship was sent out to intercept it . And then , suddenly ships start blowing up ... The Canterbury , the Donnager ... It 's got to be connected . What do you think is on this Anubis ? Something . Something worth spilling a lot of blood over . _ _ _ Ladar 's really flaky . Ah , scopes on this bucket suck . It 's nothing bigger than a light transport , nothing we can 't handle , gova gut . I 'm not worried . You gonna lock up from the adrenaline . I know how to fly . Easy . I 'm not trying to pet you the wrong way . I 'm trying to help . I 'm sorry . It 's just been a long time coming . A long fight to get here . If I had your kind of money , I 'd be sitting - in a penthouse at the Shangri-La ... - It 's my father 's money . I see . And that 's his weapon on that ship . Belters need to know what it is , so it can 't be used against us . Us ? You are a true believer . That she is . You may not share our brittle bones , but you 're definitely one of us , Beltalowda . I saw you race once . - Beautiful ship . The , uh ... - Razorback . Hot ship . Hotter pilot . Prepare to intercept . Matching course and speed . Boarding team check , Komang Gutegow ? Ya , Bosmang , grappling team , standing by . Soon as hooks are in , we drop charges , breach , subdue crew , grab the cargo then . Mowsh Ando Natet , Beratnas , they 're scientists , not soldiers . They work for my father . They 'll fight . Where did that come from ? That 's the Anubis . That 's a gunship . Breaching pod , amidships ! Seal all compartments ! All hands ! We 're being boarded ! Stinking Belters . Always trying to take what isn 't yours . How 'd you know we 'd be here ? How ? Hands off that one . She 's a complication . Put her in here until I figure out what to do with her . Ma 'am , the distress beacon has been planted on the Scopuli . Canterbury should be picking it up soon . Let 's hope they take the bait . The sooner we get Earth and Mars at each other 's throats , the sooner we get their eyes off Eros . Does it feel hot in here to you ? No . Well , I 'm hot . Check climate control and make it cooler . Yes , Ma 'am . This is Lionel Polanski . I repeat , Lionel Polanski . The crew is dead . I 'm being held captive , I 'm alone . Please help me . Somebody come and get me . Please ! Somebody help ! Somebody help , please ! All hands to action Stations ! Prepare to fire . Please ! Get me out of here . This is Lionel Polanski . Mission has failed . Scopuli has been lost . I 'm aboard the Anubis , alone . There 's something in the reactor . It looks like it consumed everyone else . If it 's a bio-weapon ... I 've never seen anything like it . I have to get off this ship . I 'll set up an O.P.A.locator beacon , and park it where no one else can find it . But I just have to leave . Eros Station is within range of the Anubis shuttle . I 'll be there , waiting for you . Miller , you asshole . Long time . How they swinging ? So , listen , that ship you were looking for ... Anubis , whatever , it never showed up here . But the funny thing is , a short-range shuttle from that ship did . Anubis 1-A is still here on Eros , racking up dock fees . Kinda interested to know what 's in this for you , amigo . I tried ... I tried to keep a low profile , but it wasn 't as easy as I hoped . I had to get off the streets . I left a trail of bread crumbs . A way for you to find me . And I waited ... And I waited ... Dawes ... You didn 't even answer . Give the Martians their water . Why didn 't you come ? You have every right to be angry . You should be angry . Please , Mummy , don 't let him sell the Razorback . I want to see it again . See you ... Proud of me ... When I come home ... Julie ? Ugh ! God , what 's that smell ? Sweat , sick . Nobody touch anything . Wait . Wait ! Oh . Oh , my god . Don 't touch her . She could be contagious . Come on , boys , we gotta go . Cavalry 's on its way . If he wants to stay , let him . There 's nothing you can do for her . And if you stay here , you 'll never find out who did this to her . Drop ' em ! Not happening . Easy . Jesus , Miller . What the hell you got yourself into ? Ain 't no way I can clean all this up . - You got that right . - We 're not asking you to do anything . We 're just gonna walk out of here real easy . We didn 't see each other . Look , you stay right where you are ! Miller , you tell me what the hell is going on here . She 's gone . What , the girl ? Room 22 , don 't touch anything in there . Miller . Just lay low . Don 't leave this Station till we talk . Let 's keep moving . We need to find out what he knows . Don 't push him too hard right now . He 's having a tough time dealing with what we saw . The girl meant something to him . It was a shock finding her like that . Miller , in here . Seal off this tenement . No one in or out without my say-so . Inspector Sematimba , CPM , what the hell are you doing here ? This is my crime scene . CPM works for me . I 'm looking for this girl . Doesn 't look like we were followed . That 's a relief . Okay , I 'd say we 're all in a bit of trouble here , so why don 't we just figure out ... What were you doing following Julie ? We didn 't know who we were looking for ... Who were those thugs back at the hotel ? We don 't know . Any goddamn thing you do know ? All that stuff on her , we saw it before on the Anubis . The Anubis . - What happened to her ? What happened to her ? - Settle down ! - Back off ! Back off ! - Hey , easy there ! Amos , for god 's sake , do something ! What we should be doing is leaving . The cops are gonna be all over us . We need to get back to the Roci and off this rock now . He 's right . We shouldn 't separate . I 'm going to prep the ship for dust-off . You guys meet us there . We both followed Julie here . We both have part of the story . I want the truth as bad as you do . Thank you for letting me come . Craig , I 'm devastated . - I never would have thought he 's ... - You weren 't here . I heard he was doing consulting work for the shipyards , which I took as a good sign . That make you feel better about betraying him ? There was no consulting work . I found out he was paying for those trips himself . He was ashamed of sitting around the house , so I played along . I let him keep his pride . It was the only thing he had left . He had you . He loved you more than anything . Frank always said , " it is damn near impossible to stay properly mad at that brat . " I 'm not Frank . Would you mind if ... I need to say goodbye . Should I be wearing a mask ? It 's not airborne . But if it 's wet , don 't touch it . Unless you want incredible things to happen . She 's got more than enough in her . Tell the crew to prepare the injections . Give us a moment . I 'm truly sorry to be the one to have to tell you this , but your daughter is dead . We still don 't know what exactly happened on the Anubis , but it looks as though Julie was the lone survivor . Somehow , she managed to pilot the shuttle to Eros . The only thing that I can say to temper this terrible news is that I was able to obtain a viable sample of the protomolecule . The injections have been prepared . We 're ready for lockdown . The irradiation units are in place . We can still do what needs to be done . We may not get another chance . We 've come so far since that incredible revelation on Phoebe . Now we stand on the precipice . We can only learn by letting it learn . All you need to do now is to give the word . I 'll be waiting . We got lucky . Proceed as planned . We didn 't hang around on the Anubis long enough to figure out what that stuff was . We got off and nuked the ship behind us . What was Julie doing on the Anubis ? She was O.P.A. She found some new bio-weapon they were putting together on Phoebe . - So did we . - She wanted to steal it . They couldn 't use it on Belters . And they used it on her . She was an Earther . She died for the belt . What the hell was that ? Attention . Eros Station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . - For your own safety , please proceed ... - You guys feel that ? We sure did . Nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion . Son of a bitch . A ship just blew up in the docks . - The Roci ? - No , it wasn 't in that bay . That 's the good news . The bad news is , the ships are all locked down tight . We 're stuck here . Shit . Hmm . The drives that match these serial numbers , what ships were they installed in ? Include black ops . Locate the drives . Where are they right now ? For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the nearest hard shelter in an orderly fashion ... What are you looking at ? When I see them cops , they 're CPM Station security . They 're gangsters with badges . One team rounds ' em up , the other shakes ' em out . This was planned . They have assignments . They knew it was gonna happen . How could they know a ship was going to blow up in the docks ? They blew it up themselves . Hey ! Where the hell are you going ? - Let him go ! - Miller 's onto something . It 's all connected . The Cant , the girl ... It 's not your problem . And it 's not your fault . None of it is . Okay . But now I 'm making it my problem . Meet me back at the Roci , I 'll be a few hours , tops . We 're better when we stick together . If I 'm not back in three hours , leave . Attention . Eros Station has experienced a radiation hazard breach . For your own safety , please proceed immediately to the ... Iodine supplement . Protects from radiation . Mandatory . Pick it up ! Move along . No . No . No . You do not want to be around me right now , okay . This is gonna get ugly . I 'm getting used to ugly . Those two in the middle . The guys who took out the Donnager had body armor just like that . Not who I 'm aiming at . Who is he ? One of the guys who do what they did to Julie . You need to go back to your friends . Dammit ! - If he killed Julie , he killed my ship too . - I need you alive ! - All right , Sabakawala . - Hey ! Break it on your feet ! Towalda supposed to go to shelter . Hey ! You go quiet and go now , else we throw you in there , ourselves . Help me up . My neck . Come on . Here 's your problem , asshole . That just made me feel better . Turn around . My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson . Many of you know me , one way or another . My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson . My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson . Many of you know me , one way or another . I come before you today not as a member of the Outer Planets Alliance , though I am proud to call myself one , but as citizen of the system . At this moment , the UNN Nathan Hale is headed for Tycho Station to arrest me because the UN believes I was involved in the attacks on the Donnager . That is not true . And I can prove it . This datacube was recovered from the wreckage of the Donnager , in the armor of a Martian marine . I 'm broadcasting the raw data with this message . Anyone can examine and authenticate it . It 's a detailed analysis of the ships that destroyed the Donnager . They were advanced stealth fighters . They didn 't come from the Belt . I didn 't build them . No Belter did , or could . Some people won 't believe that coming from me , because of who I am . I accept that . None of us can change the things we 've done . But we can all change what we do next . I 've seen battle . I 've taken many lives . I 've been the oppressor , and I know his mind . And now I hear the drumbeats of war . It 's the sound of lies and the love of power , and I cannot stand idly by . The belt has served the inner planets for generations . Belters give , Earth and Mars take . Our language has changed , the things we care about have changed , even our bodies have changed . We look upon each other as different and we 've grown to hate each other for that . And now someone , somewhere , for some ungodly reason wants the whole , sad lot of us to fight and die . Well , this is not the Belt 's fight . This evidence proves beyond a doubt that the ships that destroyed the Donnager were built at the Bush Naval shipyards . They were built by Earth . All right , who is the guy you 're guarding ? The scientist ? Yeah . He was a scientist . Dresden . I heard them call him Dresden , that 's all I know . What 's this , huh ? It 's a Ceres Griega tatt . I used to run with them back there , so what ? So that makes you a gangster , you see . But you 're wearing a cop uniform . Why is that ? I went straight . I 'm gonna count to one . One . CPM offered a bunch of Griegas jobs here , a few months back . Sweet salary , fat bonus , no questions asked . And it wasn 't just us . All the Ceres crews , Ggolden Bough , Dos Arriagas , Sohiro 's ... They hired everybody . What for ? Tech stuff , mostly , it turned out . They had us hooking up cameras and science gear all over the Station . Why are you herding everybody into those shelters ? 'Cause that 's what they asked me to do today ! Their scrip spends . If these assholes want people in those shelters , we should let them out . Hey , you 're welcome to try . You said you were a cop . You a cop like him ? You 're going take me to the nearest shelter , and you 're gonna help me get in . CPM sees me with you , they shoot us both . Oh , he 's got a point . Jesus , Miller ! Let 's get this poor officer some help . As far as I can tell , all the transit pod lines are shut down . Why would they do that ? All the ships are locked down , nobody 's going anywhere . First things first . The Roci . There 's gotta be other ways to get to the docks , so we need to find one . Wait ... Holden , we 're on the move ... Comms just went dark . This ain 't an accident . It 's a plan . Please ! I 'm sorry I was late . The transit pods have been shut down ! The shelters are full . - Please ! I just want to get to the shelters . - Go home . Stay where you are ! Move along now , or we will use force . Are we just gonna stand here ? We can 't just charge in and start shooting . Pretty sure we can . Hey , keep your hands off these people . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - Following orders . - That 's Miller 's pal . Yeah , I didn 't get any orders anything like this . You stand down . I 've got rank here . Not today , you don 't . Sir , sir , we 're trying to ... - We got a man down ! - What the hell is this ? He needs medical attention . I can see that , but who the hell are you ? Hey , some of your guys are taking fire down that connector shaft . - You want to check it out . - We 'll take care of him . You stay right there . Open the door . They said , once it 's shut , it stays shut . All right , all right . You 'll be all right . Jesus . What ... Get out ! Get out ! What ... What the hell was that ? We just got hit with a mega-dose of hard radiation . How bad ? We 're dead . Attention . Eros Station has experienced a radiation hazard breach ...

 This land is ours now . Resist , and you will be greeted by death . The only thing that matters now is killing Pike . - Echo ? - Bellamy . - You know her ? - Yeah . She 's Ice Nation . She was in the cage next to mine . Where the hell is Echo ? Ai haiplana . A.L.I.E. controls people one person at a time until there is no one left . What we 're doing is too important . We need to increase the population in the City of Light . No ! We will not be done until everyone is with us . I know how to stop A.L.I.E. I see it . It 's a kill switch . Come on , Clarke . The nuclear power plants that were destroyed by the bombs have begun to melt down . The Earth 's surface will be uninhabitable , so , you see , the City of Light is the only thing that can save you . Would you really condemn the human race to die in 6 months ? I 'll figure something out . We always do . John ? Hey , hey , it 's ok . Clarke , you 're not acting like someone who just saved the world . Because we didn 't . Indra ? Indra . Indra . Indra . Gone . It 's over . And Pike ? I waited until it was done . No . She 'll be ok . Octavia can take care of herself . That 's not what I 'm worried about . She won 't be charged . Everyone will say that Pike had it coming . Maybe we all do . How do we tell these people that the world is ending after everything they 've been through ? We don 't , not until we know A.L.I.E. was telling you the truth . It was the truth . Still , keep it to ourselves until we know what we 're dealing with and how to stop it . Damn . You 're afraid of how people will react . Yes . Besides , I could use a break from keeping you alive . You gave them back their pain , Clarke . Let 's not add to it by telling them they 're gonna die in 6 months . Good . Once everyone 's down , we go home , we get to work . We didn 't survive this long just to let a little radiation takes us out . Thank you for keeping me alive . You don 't make it easy . He didn 't fall . He chased me in the City of Light . Lexa killed him . Wanheda . Sorry about the ... you know . Smashing my face into a wall or pistol-whipping me ? Can I plead the chip ? When you save the world , you 're supposed to celebrate . I think it 's a rule . I 'll celebrate when we know the others are ok and when I get the mainframe back online . Is it weird I want to go back in ? It 's not weird , Jasper . It is weird that you can code when you 're not a coder , though , right ? It 's like A.L.I.E. upgraded your brain . You ok ? Are you ? You 've been through more than anyone . There 's nothing like a little pain to remind you you 're alive . Wish I got an upgrade . Ok . Everyone out . Go on . Take the music with you . I need quiet to fix the radio . Raven , we won . I 'm sure everyone 's fine in Polis . I hope so , but until I 'm certain ... Do you need help with the radio ? No . I got this . You sure ? Rule one of engineering ... no drinking on the job . Go on . Celebrate . Please enjoy yourselves . I 'm starving . Help me raid the kitchen . Bellamy , are you there ? Polis , this is Arkadia . Come in , Polis . Come on . Where are you ? What have I done ? What have we done ? I told you to stay upstairs with the rest of the wounded . Do you need another shot ? Do Miller and Jackson have everything they need up there ? Yeah . They blame us for the chip . It 's not safe for us here anymore . Wanheda . Wanheda . Clarke . Good . You 're down . We have to go . The rover 's in the north woods . What about the wounded ? Grounders don 't want our help . Our people we 'll treat at Arkadia . Raven , on radio : Hello ? Bellamy , please , come in . Raven , you ok ? Yeah . Yeah . We 're all in one piece . That 's good . There 's something we need you to look into . First , tell me how my friends are . Did everyone make it ? Clarke ? I 'm here , thanks to you . Raven , did A.L.I.E. ever tell you why she created the City of Light ? No . Why ? - Clarke ? - Fill Raven in . - All right . Raven ... - They need a doctor . Roan ? He got shot trying to help me . I thought he was dead . Not yet , but he 's close . No exit wound . We need to get the bullet out quickly . Get away from our king . Wait . Please , no . You 're making a mistake . We 're part of the coalition . I could save him , but you have to let me . We have our own healer . Echo ... Hey , Bellamy , don 't . - Man , stop . - Let her go , Echo . Let her go . Back off , Bellamy . Your king is my friend . Let us help him . I saw you in the City of Light . I know you destroyed it . Thank you for that . Look around you . Skaikru did this to us . Because of them , Ontari , your rightful commander , is dead . This imposter stole her Flame . No . Wanheda saved us , all of us ... Grounder and Skaikru . There would have been nothing to save us from if not for you . Azgeda has no authority here . We do now . In the name of King Roan , as rightful caretakers of the throne of the Commanders , Polis is now under Azgeda rule . Like hell it is . Where 's your war chief , girl ? Our war chief is dead , Ambassador . As a member of the queen 's guard , command of the army has fallen to me until the king awakens . If he awakens . Until a new Commander can ascend , Polis is to be ruled by ambassadors of the coalition . If Azgeda wants it , they must take it by force . Consider it taken . No Skaikru leaves this city . Looks like saving the world will have to wait . That 's it . Let me help you , please . It 's good to see you 're making friends . Hello , John . Glad to see you made it down . I could use some help with the dead . Go float yourself . These dead are on you , too , Chancellor . Hey , what are you doing ? Stocking up . What 's it look like . Stocking up for what , exactly ? It 's not safe for my kind here . Are forbidden . I have to leave this place , John . So , what , you 're gonna bail on me again ? I didn 't bail on you . I came back , took the damn chip because Jaha said he would take me to you . Hey ... come with me to Arkadia . I 'm serious , Emori , ok ? We can be together there . My people will protect you . Are you sure about that ? How many times have they cast you out ? It 's different now . They owe me , ok ? Please . Come on . - Ok . - Ok ? Ok . We can still pick up a few things first , right ? Sir , that 's everyone we could find . Stationed 10 guards at the temple door . Are you sure you don 't want me to stay ? You lead them home , Major . We 'll be there as soon as we can . - Marcus ... - I 'm ok . We focus on what comes next . - Well ? - You 're not gonna like it . When you destroyed the City of Light , there were a thousand Azgeda warriors inside the city of Polis . Good timing . Only way to remove them is by force . - Then let 's remove them . - Slow down . You 're talking about a war . Yes . Rockline , Flokru , and Broadleaf will join Trikru without question , but we 'll still be short . This is madness . We should be leaving with the others while we still have time . They know where we live . If we run , they 'll follow . There are 8 other clans . How do we get them to join us ? I can do it , but I 'll need the Flame . No . Clarke , the clans - will follow whoever has the Flame . - Azgeda won 't . Then we fight . - That 's the point . - No , it 's not . The point is , there 's no time for a fight . We have to save Roan . Save him ? They won 't let us near him . Wait a second . What don 't we know ? The reason A.L.I.E. created the City of Light . Why ? Nuclear reactors inside power plants that survived the bombs are melting down . Radiation levels are already rising . If we can 't figure out a way to fix it , all of us will be dead in 6 months . - A.L.I.E. told you this ? - Yes . - And you believe her ? - Raven 's looking into it . I believe her . Even if it 's true , that 's 6 months away . There are a thousand Ice Nation warriors on the street who want to kill us today . They won 't kill us . How could you possibly know that ? Because we 're gonna surrender . Ontari belongs with her people . Tell them I only talk to Bellamy . It worked . She 's in . Your king 's on the table . Well , go save him . She won 't talk to you . I don 't like this , John . Bellamy 's right there . Just wait here . She 's Ice Nation . She can 't be trusted . Never a dull moment ? Bellamy , pay attention . She 's part of the royal guard , spies . That 's why she 's not marked , very dangerous , very loyal . Not to the people who saved her life . Bellamy , I know how you feel about her , but you can 't lose control . You offer them technology , guns , whatever it takes to keep her talking . Is that clear ? I didn 't agree to give them guns . Well , that 's probably because you 're not an idiot . It won 't get that far . Our objective is to buy time for Abby to save the king , and if you want to help , grab a weapon , stand a post . Take mine . I got this . I 'm sorry , Bellamy . What is it ? Do you know what I said about being safe with my people ? Your plan was better . Let 's go . Before you say anything , remember , I saved your life by taking you out of Mount Weather . I 'm sorry I couldn 't tell you to bring the girl , but I was following orders , Bellamy . I wish it was that easy . Today , you guys . I need more time . I know how it feels to lose someone you care about to war , but we do what we do for our people . You slaughter us , we slaughter you . That all went away in the City of Light , but it 's back now , so here we are . The bullet is pressing against his carotid . It 's cutting off blood flow to his brain . As soon as I get it out , he should wake up . What are the terms of your surrender ? We recognize Ice Nation rule , and you honor Lexa 's coalition , including the 13th clan . No . Come on . Come on . Almost there . We 'll give you guns and show you how to use them . - Got it . - Good job . - What now ? - Now we wait . Trikru accepts this ? They 're not happy about it . Not much they can do now , though , is there , without an army . You were there . Then you know why everyone hates Skaikru and why we can never accept your terms . The alternative is war . Is that what you want ? No one wants war . Lay down your guns , and we 'll let your children live . His breathing is still too shallow . You said his lungs were fine . No . I said I thought so . It 's possible a bone fragment could 've lodged in the tissue . I 'll give you time to decide . Hey ... I wasn 't done talking . You are now . Screw this . - Come on . - It 's time to go . No . He needs more time . If Roan doesn 't wake up , we 're all dead . Guns on the ground , or he dies . We disarm , we 're done . Abby 'll come through . Do what she says . Guns on the ground now . - They 're here . - Back door . I have to close , or he 'll bleed out . No . We have to go , or we 'll bleed out . - This is gonna have to do . - Good job . Go . No . We were trying to save him . Roan , help us . Tell them we 're friends . You shouldn 't try to stand so soon . Where is Ontari ? Dead , Sire , killed by them . We couldn 't save her , but we did what we came here to do . Now I need you to honor your promise to protect my people . Yeah . That was before your people shot me and killed my Commander . We just saved your damn life . Roan , your people are hungry for you to lead them . Do so now as your mother would have . Kill Wanheda . Take her power and rule over everything . - That was something . - I know . Hey , look . Um , now that everybody 's coming back , I just ... I don 't want you to think that I expect anything . What if I do ? Well , yeah . That 's be good , too . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Ok . Sorry . Knocking 's not your thing , is it ? Get dressed and meet me in Engineering . Why ? What 's wrong ? We 're all gonna die . I 'll get Jasper . Jasper . One second . What were you doing ? No ... nothing . Sleeping . Raven needs us in Engineering . Let 's go . After the second Fukushima disaster , Panacea Power patented a failsafe system with multiple redundancies . By 2048 , two dozen mega reactors were built to withstand any disaster , even a nuclear attack . But that 's good , right ? There 's always a catch . The plants were built to be self-sustaining for a hundred years . So the warrantee just ran out . This is us . Yes . It 's been yellow since we 've landed . Yellow we can handle ... our bodies adapted in space ... but it 's rising when it should be falling , and when it hits red ... We 're dead . How long ? At the current rate of increase , 6 months , but it 'll be bad way before that . Can we stop it ? No . Man . I 'm gonna watch the sunrise . Wanheda and her friends are locked up . The rest of Skaikru appears to have fled , but we 're ready to ride them down on your command . Not yet . Forgive me for saying so , but we can 't afford for our people to think you 're weak . Call me weak again . I meant no offense . Yeah , you did . Say your piece . You haven 't been home in more than 3 years . You act as if that was my choice . Of course it wasn 't . You were a bargaining chip . It almost broke your mother to send you away . Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return , but you lost . Our war chiefs don 't respect you . Then I 'll get new war chiefs . The army is loyal to them , not you . And who are you loyal to ... Spy ? I 'm loyal to my clan , to my king . Let me serve you . I can help you do what your mother never could , what Ontari never could . - Rule everything . - Yes . Trikru is weak and ready to fall , and Skaikru is more hated than ever . Give the order to take them both out , and our war chiefs will follow you . Show them Wanheda 's head while you do it , and they will worship you . Bring honor to your grandfather 's crown . I know that look . I loved her , Mom . I know . Wanheda , on your feet . Where 's the king ? Hey , I need to see Roan . Hey . Hey ! - No ! - Hey ! - Wait ! No ! No ! - Wait ! Echo ! Echo ! - Wait ! - Echo , listen to me . - Where are you taking her . - Echo ! Echo ! No . - Sire ... - Get out . It 's always something with you , isn 't it ? Roan , we need your help . Well , this should be good . Something 's coming , something unlike anything we 've seen before . What 's coming ? You know the fire that ended the world . Lexa called it Praimfaya . It 'll be like that , a wave of radiation that 'll kill everything in its path . Our ancestors survived Praimfaya , and so will we . No , you won 't , not this time , not without us . Look . I don 't know if we can stop it , but if we can 't , all of us will be dead in 6 months . Science is our only hope . Please , honor Lexa 's coalition . Recognize Skaikru as the 13th clan so we can go home and come up with a way for us to survive , all of us . Listen to that . I let you live , I 'll be dead in 6 days , not 6 months . Sorry . Can 't . Jus drein jus daun ! Jus drein jus daun ! Jus drein jus daun ! Jus drein jus daun ! Jus drein jus daun ! Jus drein jus daun ! Jus drein ... I 'll give you this . We were told it was lost . You give me one good reason why I shouldn 't just take that and cut your head off . I just gave you one , and you know I wouldn 't be offering this unless what I was saying were true . Take it . The clans will follow you . That 's what you want . I want what 's best for my people , same as you . Then help me save them . Roan , listen to me . You wanted an Ice Nation Commander . With this , you control who ascends . There will never be a Commander to rule over Azgeda unless you allow it . I know you 've all come here for an execution , but no one else will die here today . The City of Light has fallen ... And there is no Commander left to rule us . Until another Nightblood ascends , I ... King Roan of Azgeda , eldest son of Nia , grandson of Theo ... am caretaker of the throne and keeper of the Flame . Until another ascends , Azgeda honors and will defend the coalition of the last true Commander ... Lexa kom Trikru , including the 13th clan . Let it be known that an attack against Skaikru is an attack against us all . From your king . With this , you 'll be safe in any of our lands . You think we 'll ever be able to trust each other again ? I doubt it . Welcome back to the coalition . Time to go . We 'll do our best to keep the king on his throne . We 'll find a way to beat the radiation . If either of you screw this up , we die . No pressure . This is serious , O. If anyone finds out why Roan helped us , it 'll be every clan for itself . The king will fall , and they 'll come after us . It 's getting dark . Let 's do this . - May we meet again . - May we meet again . You turn the page . You turn the page , and you don 't look back . You do better today than you did yesterday . You understand ? Before you know it , you 'll deserve to survive . I hope so . The youth that inherited the earth . And they have 6 months to save it . Ok , Princess . What now ? Now we survive . Hey .

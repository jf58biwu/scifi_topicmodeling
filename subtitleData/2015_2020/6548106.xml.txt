I need the name of my contact . That man over there- - suit and blue tie . Science Minister . What have you told him ? Nothing yet . Is this some kind of a joke ? nor will I until I must . Which is when ? During His Highness ' speech . The Nazi Embassy . In front of all those people ? The crowd will provide cover . It 's the only opportunity . what are you doing out here ? I could use a belt . what happened ? You run into a pole or something ? Bill . You sure ? Laura 's usually home by now . They 're not coming home . What ? I am so sorry . What are you talking about ? they killed them . They- - They just killed them last night . The Kempeitai ? Yeah . That makes no sense . What the fuck are you saying ? The kids ? They- - They said they were Jews . But they 're not . Laura 's and mine . right ? Why didn 't they kill you ? I- - I don 't know . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Bill . - Bill ! - I said get the hell away from me ! Listen up ! tie him off . Leave him here . You understand ? Nobody cuts that body down till the birds pick it clean . We administered 200 micro grams of D-lysergic acid 30 minutes ago . Advanced interrogation technique . inducing a sensation of oneness . Oneness ? a unity with all things . I fail to see how that would lead to the disclosure of information . the subject feels no reason to hold anything back . There is no reason since he is connected to everything and everyone . Mr Meyer . How did you know the route my car would be taking yesterday ? Do you have an informant in my office ? You have a halo . The medication often induces hallucinations . Tell me the name of your informant . You 're an angel . Enough . Will you bring him out of this ? Obergruppenfuhrer . - I cannot do that . - You can 't ? it takes hours for the medication to wear off . I see . and we reward him with an oceanic experience . Will you tell me when this little fantasy has worn off ? [ " Summertime " by Ella Fitzgerald ] * Summertime and the livin ' is easy * * Fish are- - * I 'll take care of this . I can deal with it . I did this . * - and the cotton is high * Joe : We need to find his keys . Juliana : Do you think they 're still on him ? They 'd better be . We need to move his car . * Your daddy 's rich and your ma is good lookin ' * - - * - All right . - Okay . don 't you cry * you 're gonna rise up singin ' * Got a light ? I don 't smoke . That 's good . You live longer that way . but I 'm not in the mood for small talk . I understand . I don 't blame you after what you 've been through . and some matches ? You 're lucky to be alive . but only because he still wants to find your girlfriend . all right ? I don 't want any part of your movement or whatever the hell it is . If they saw me- - Jesus . Tell me what Randall said to you and to them . Randall- - Randall was in the next cell . - He didn 't say anything . - You sure about that ? That 's why they shot him . Frank . We 're on the same side here . I am not on your side . Your side got my sister killed and her kids . My side didn 't kill them . The pons did . Frank . I lost my husband and two brothers . hmm ? You just aim a movie at them . How about you put some of their blood on the streets for a change ? Frank . and we 're just begging Berlin to drop another bomb . So you just watch old movies . The films are more important than you know . Your Highness . The solidarity between our nations Ambassador Reiss . And it 's time we greeted our subjects in the Pacific States in person . which makes my next request very difficult . We respectfully request that the Crown Prince cancel his public address outside the Embassy . This is not a proper request to be made in the presence of His Highness . Trade Minister . I want to hear why . And I want to hear it from the person actually making the request . I have received word from New York . The Resistance are stepping up their attacks . but my Imperial Guard and the Kempeitai provide excellent security . We have obtained evidence that the Resistance are in possession of false travel papers . You have knowledge of such a threat against the Crown Prince ? but the safety of Your Highness is our paramount concern . but I will address my people in person . because we certainly will . Thank you for the tea and your hospitality . Are you aware of any threats such as Oberfuhrer mentioned ? not least from Nazi agents seeking to destabilize us and blame their crimes on subversives . So you 're comfortable with the Crown Prince proceeding ? The Imperial Guard will vouch for his safety . And the false travel papers ? What about them ? Who might be carrying them or if in fact they exist . Matters of internal security do not concern the Trade Ministry . the subject is recovered from his exposure to the D-lysergic acid . He says he needs to see you and only you . Mister . Look at you . the one who makes the paper birds ? What if I am ? I know where he went . and I 'll tell you . You tell me or I 'll kill you . I saw him drive down that way late last night . What kind of car ? black . Where was he going ? I don 't know . let 's go . is this far ? maybe . He marked it on the map . What do you think it is ? I know what you 're thinking . We do not have time for this . You don 't have to come . I 'm doing this . haven 't you had enough ? [ Phone rings ] Captain Connolly . please join us . Obergruppenfuhrer . Mr Meyer has recovered from his hallucinations . He 's just told me something very interesting . I 'm sorry . What did he tell you ? He 's named you as a conspirator . That 's r- - That 's ridiculous . It 's obviously a lie . Why would he name you ? I don 't know . I 've never met this man . An informant doesn 't have to meet his co-conspirators . Sit down . he just has to pass on the information . What information ? Captain . Obergruppenfuhrer . he 's lying . Tell him now . This- - This man is lying . Captain . Mr Meyer has given me a very detailed account of how you passed on the information . Explain yourself . I- - I-It 's not true . Just tell him it 's not true . just the word of this Semite . Captain . I have nothing to confess . this is a trick . It 's a lie . Are you saying I 'm a fool ? I 've allowed myself to be deceived ? of course not . So he 's telling the truth . He 's not ! Please tell him you 're lying . no ! You knew he was lying . No . I suspected . we still don 't know how they got to us . Can I come in ? You want a drink ? I 've just been to the Kempeitai . but they did say it wasn 't about Laura and the kids . It was about your crazy fucking girlfriend . - It wasn 't like that . - This is her fault . She and that sister of hers did something and dragged the rest of us into it . That 's the only reason they 're dead . They tortured me . They beat me . For what ? information I couldn 't give them . Couldn 't or wouldn 't ? I did not kill Laura and the kids . The Kempeitai did . Frank ! Don 't you get it ? Yeah . I get it . Frank ? and I hope they 're taken away from you like you took mine from me so you could feel the same pain I 'm feeling . Radio : ... sail upon this ship do their duty with honor and integrity for the betterment of our glorious empire . His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess began the day at the Shinto Temple in the Pan Pacific park the Goddess of the Sun . he will speak in front of the Nazi embassy in a public address . All subjects of the Pacific States are invited . Pretty girl . It should just be up through those trees . Thanks for coming with me . We shouldn 't be doing this . I don 't understand you . You would if you saw that film . Yeah ? A film that shows another world ? So what ? So it means that maybe things don 't have to be this way . Maybe the world can change . I don 't see how . You sound like Frank . I 'm starting to like Frank . You ever think how different life could be if you could change just one thing ? Like what ? My dad died during the war . And I don 't know who I 'd be if that hadn 't happened . Come on . hold up a second . too . maybe I 'm not . I 've never even met him . and- - he doesn 't live near us . He never took any interest . I 'm sorry . I don 't know why I felt I had to tell you this . I 'm glad you did . m-maybe you 're right . my life would be a whole lot different . now you have . Maybe it will be . Frank . buddy ? I 've got to work to eat . good . Great . did you tell Mr Wyndam - Matson you 're here ? yeah . I told him . Frank . Really good . That 's got to be it . my God . That 's a woman . What is it ? It 's their names . Trudy Walker . There 's another name here . Lemuel Washington . That 's my boss at the diner .

Pork chops ? I thought your people didn 't eat pork chops . not don 't serve it . then . like shoe leather . you can think about why you lied to me . I didn 't lie to you . You told me you didn 't know what happened to my friend . I don 't . either ? taught me how to pray * Yeah . I know her . I thought maybe you did . Maybe you saw her with my friend and clean forgot about it . She used to work here . a couple of times . She worked here . Where is she now ? man . She up and ran out of here this afternoon . * I know it 's nobody 's fault but mine * You can get my pork chops now . * It 's nobody 's fault but mine . * what are you doing ? What does it look like ? I 'm working . That 's not a replica . What are you going to do with that ? Go back to your station . Buddy . I said go back to your station now . * It 's nobody 's fault but mine . * it 's nobody 's fault but mine * Who do you think that woman was ? She must have been a part of the Resistance . Probably tortured her to get those names . So then Lem 's part of the Resistance . I think he 's supposed to be your contact . Why didn 't he say anything ? I don 't- - Get out of the car ! Run now !

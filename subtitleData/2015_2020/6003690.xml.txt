 I 'm peggy carter . During the war , I fought side-by-side With captain america . We defeated the enemy ... Please , don 't do this . We have time . ... But I lost the love of my life . I work for the ssr , America 's premiere covert intelligence agency . But now that the war is over , My mission parameters these days are ... Agent carter , cover the phones . ... Different . That all changed when an old friend Asked me to become a double agent . I have a vault . Somebody cleaned me out . A couple of weeks later , my inventions ... They start turning up on the black market . As of this moment , howard stark is a fugitive from justice . You 're the only one that can clear my name . Edwin jarvis . He 'll help you in any way he can . I found the man who stole howard 's inventions . He was part of a bigger conspiracy . Leviathan is coming . Who is leviathan ? He didn 't have time to tell me . All he left behind was a symbol . I must determine what this means Before the ssr catches up to me Or my friends . Clearly , you don 't know the rules of the house . Is this not apartment 3-f ? Who are you ? Jimmy . My girlfriend , molly ... she lives here . I swear . 5 ' 5 " , blonde , works at bonwit teller ? Next one over . Oh . Would it be too much trouble if I could come ... have a nice night . Is the only evidence we found at the crime scene . What can you tell us about him ? He was relatively clean . He came and went without so much as a peep . Any visitors ? Only for just an hour . ♪ let 's make romance tonight ♪ ♪ let 's take a chance tonight under the light of the moon ♪ Looks like business is good . Hey , ray . How you doing ? This is it ... 424 . Check all the usual hidey-holes . Hey ! Take it easy on the furniture . That 'll be all . Thank you . All right , welcome to amateur hour . I got cash , passports . Got a british passport for " alfred lean , " An american passport for an " orson hawks , " And an italian pass-a-port for " federico rossellini . " We got a film buff on our hands . What you got ? You find something ? Well , it sure isn 't nothing . Powdered eggs again . What am I paying for ? Still , better than the blitz , right , english ? Oh , just barely . Morning , girls . Someone had a late night . What time did the cat drag you in ? I didn 't exactly get dragged out . Molly , you didn 't . What can I say ? Jimmy is very persuasive . And nimble . You got a guy , peggy ? I 'm afraid I 'm married to my work at the moment . What about mr . Fancy ? You know , the guy I 've seen around the automat ... Nice suit , nice car , nice shoulders . Oh , no . No . He 's just a colleague . Good day , ladies . Early bird and all that . Ah , miss carter , please sit . This will only be a moment . In 1925 , the great harry houdini Performed at this very building . Ugh , houdini . That 's never good . Women stood spellbound and watched As he escaped from handcuffs , Straight jackets , steamer trunks . But the one trick he could not pull off Was ascending the stairs . It 's a simple rule , ladies . No men above the first floor . Molly bowen Please go to your room and pack your things . Miss fry ... Please . I hope you had a splendid evening , Because it will be your last at the griffith . Let her be an example for the rest of you . This institution is not unlike fort knox or alcatraz . Whether by force or trickery , this building is impenetrable . Can you believe that ? I don 't , actually . No building is impenetrable . Ladies and gentlemen , our pal leet brannis . Coroner says the amalgam in his teeth is russian . Yeah ? How did he get the scar ? His voice box was cut out . Mm . Probably happened during the war . Russian rifle division ... the 478th . Now , you ready to have your socks knocked off ? Leet brannis died . I know that , son . I 'm staring at his corpse . Two years ago . Guy I knew in basic ended up in the u.S. Embassy in moscow . I had him dig into the 478th . Turns out , they were wiped out in ' 44 In the battle of finow , germany . Dead don 't walk . At least , not in my experience . Where we at with your guy ? We 're still pulling what 's left of him from the truck wreckage , But we were able to lift some prints From the passports that I found . We had a vodka bottle . Plus , we got this beauty . Don 't touch . What did the lab rats say ? They think it 's some kind of long-range transmitter . How long ? Moscow-long ? Run his picture by your embassy friend . I 'm on it . Hey , passport guy 's mine . You got any friends in moscow ? Or anywhere else ? Don 't be that guy . Ran the license plate we pulled from the roxxon debris . Belongs to howard stark . I found that . Where 's the rest of the car ? Uh , we just got a plate and a bumper . Boss , stark was on the lam when roxxon went down . Do we really think he would risk his freedom to blow it up ? Or in ... whatever the hell happened . Somebody was driving that car . I want to know who . Edwin , leave the dishes . I can take care of it . Anna , darling , I 'm going to take you up on that offer . The day beckons . I 'll , uh , be in the garden . Love you ! And you ! In polite society , One telephones ahead before trespassing . I imagine strange women traipsing through the property Isn 't a completely unusual occurrence . That 's a fair point . What brings you here ? My landlady gave me an idea . Why , now if we could get an opinion from your butcher ... Someone robbed howard 's impenetrable vault . If I can find out how he got in , Perhaps I can trace where he went And locate howard 's missing technology . You 're not really dressed for it , I 'm afraid . Our thief didn 't exactly walk the items out of the front door . The night of the break-in , did you hear anything ? There was a tremendous thunderstorm . It knocked the power out , including the alarms , For almost two hours . Not that I would have heard any of it . I 'm afraid the sultry combination Of candlelight and rain always puts me out like a baby . Hmm . You 're quite the guard dog . Security is not within my purview . Sousa : Ssr . Open up . Unbelievable . A known fugitive isn 't answering his door . Knock harder . Sure . Can I borrow your forehead ? Good afternoon , gentlemen . How may I help you ? Afternoon . Agents thompson and sousa with the ssr . If you 're looking for mr . Stark , I 'm afraid he 's indefinitely unavailable . We 're well-aware of that , mr . Jarvis . That is your name , isn 't it ? Mr. Edwin jarvis ? You misplace anything recently ? Yes , I did lose a fountain pen on fifth avenue . How about the bumper off a fleetmaster ? Just the bumper ? Wish you 'd found the entire car . I reported it stolen several days ago . Detective davis at the 19th precinct was very helpful . If there 's nothing further ... That bumper was found at a major crime scene . There 's plenty further . Mr. Stark doesn 't like visitors , Whether he 's here to receive them or not . Look , mr . Jarvis , I can call a judge And wait here to get a warrant . But honestly , it 's almost lunchtime , How would you like to take a ride downtown ? Well , lead the way . Well , this will be novel . I haven 't been in the back of a car in years . Come on , butch . Be a pal ? Sorry , krzeminski . I got plans . Yauch , what about you ? Told my gal I 'd take her to a show . I can 't swing it . Why don 't you ask carter ? Dooley would kill me if I let a lady take nights . Besides , she can barely make her own shift . Work day starts at 9 : 00 a.M. , honey . Tell me , agent krzeminski , Who are you bringing to the show ... Your wife or your girlfriend ? Come on in . Have a seat . We really appreciate you coming down here To talk with us , mr . Jarvis . That isn 't already in the missing-car report I filed . That report might take us a while to dig up . You see , the nypd aren 't as efficient As the ssr at record-keeping , Which is saying something , because our files are a wreck . That hurts . My filing 's impeccable . Isn 't that stark 's butler ? You know this guy ? Only from the file . Do you think he was really involved Well , maybe he didn 't blow the place up , But he 's capable of driving a getaway car . It 's funny . A lot of stuff gets stolen from howard stark ... Cars , bombs , death rays . Actually , the death ray 's accounted for . It 's in nevada , I believe . Hmm . You know these men ? Take a good look . We have reliable information that says That both of these men were in possession Of some of your boss ' misdoings , And now they 're dead . Oh , what a pity . Sounds like you found our thieves . Unless , of course , they were working for your boss . Would you look at that ? Five minutes in , And thompson hasn 't knocked out a single tooth . Well , don 't let this guy fool you . He may be a butler ... butlers know powerful people . If we don 't play this just right , He 'll have a dozen lawyers down here by lunch . What about the stolen-car report ? Currently lost in the system . But if the car was actually stolen , We got nothing to use on him . Eh , we got something that 'll rattle this limey 's cage good . I 'll tell you , you know what I would do If the bumper fell off my car while I was committing a crime ? I 'd file a stolen-car report . Well , if you 're implying that mr . Stark would ever ... I 'm implying you . Mr. Stark 's on the run . He is also ... An innocent man . I can see why he hired you . You 're smart , cool-headed , extremely loyal , Which is surprising , Considering you were charged with treason . There you go . Stay on him . Oh , yeah . It 's right here . There 's not much in there . But seeing as whatever you did 's Been swept under a rug , I 'm guessing It 's a big green one made of stark money , hmm ? So you dodged the treason conviction . But you couldn 't get out of the dishonorable discharge . Well , I guess money can 't buy everything . This looks bad ... Bad to every good man who ever served , Bad to your friends , neighbors ... And to the fine folks at the office of immigration . Yeah , I 'm putting that on the table . That 'll be a fun conversation to have with the wife . Yeah ? " honey , pack a bag . " spot of bother . We 're being deported . " you know what ? Let 's get her on the phone . I 'll tell her myself . You leave my wife out of this . You dragged her into it when you broke the law with your boss . You pay , she pays . Hmm . He 's about to fold . And admit what ? If I had my way , damn near everything . This guy washes stark 's underwear . He knows . Hey , it 's just getting good . I should get back to my station . I 'm sure the last thing you want is to put anna on a plane And have to explain why . All right , I 'll let you take my shift . It 's a one-time offer , carter . Carter ! Excuse me , chief dooley . I need your signature , sir . What ? Can 't it wait ? I 'm afraid the codes are ready for analysis . I need your approval . Thank you . Why don 't you sit here awhile ? Think about it . I 'm gonna get a coffee . You want something ? That 's my cue . What do you think ? I think he 's on the verge of telling you What stark had for breakfast two months ago . Mm-hmm . You feel him sweat ? Wife 's the key . Stay on the wife . Mr. Jarvis , I want you to meet ... I 'm afraid I mistakenly took your stolen-car report . Well , thank you for your hospitality , gentlemen . Unless you 're going to arrest and charge me , I 'll be on my way . If there 's anything further you 'd like to discuss , Please feel free to contact one of mr . Stark 's attorneys . Do you have any idea how stupid that was ? I didn 't ... exactly . You didn 't think . For the love of eve , will somebody tell me what I did , Who I cheesed off to have you dumped in my lap ? Why you never catch any actual assignments . Hey . You see this man ? He did exemplary work today , and you ruined it . Now , what do you have to say to him ? Agent thompson , I apologize . Agent carter , sorry doesn 't even begin to cover it . Doesn 't even begin to cover it . Get out of my sight . Sir . ♪ you see me when you please ♪ ♪ and think it 's right ♪ ♪ that I should stay at home every night ♪ ♪ if this is all in sight , I don 't want your kind of love ♪ Oh , I 've been on my feet so long , I 've sprouted roots . Hello , angie , sorry . An 8-hour shift , and I got a whole 50 cents in tips . The war 's over . I thought we were all spending money again . How was your day ? Would have been a considerable improvement . I got a bottle of schnapps and half a rhubarb pie . Let 's see which one makes us sick first . Oh , sounds lovely , but I was just about to go to bed . It 's 8 : 00 , grandma . Come on . Tell me about your crappy day . I 'm really tired . M-maybe some other time . Didn 't mean to disturb you . No , you didn 't disturb me . I ju ... no , it 's fine . I know a brush-off when I see it . Angie ... oh . Ah , miss carter , miss martinelli , May I introduce you to our new resident , Miss dorothy underwood ? Oh , call me dottie . Nice to meet you . This place is pretty swell , huh ? Hmm . Seems like one big , happy family . No , it 's a pleasure to meet you . I love your accent . England , right ? I 've never met anybody from there . Miss underwood hails from iowa And is pursuing a ballet career . Typically , I find dancers too carefree and irresponsible , Though I have always appreciated the discipline of ballet . Nice to meet you , dot . Uh , I didn 't mean to interrupt . No harm . Wasn 't much more to say . I 'm sure you 'll be very happy here . Uh ... Do you have anything you want to tell me ? Not at present , no . Very well . Let 's get on with it . Mr. Stark believed The intruder had some advanced technological assistance . Mr. Stark believes brushing your teeth Requires advanced technological assistance . Shall we ? You 've done this before . Himalayas before the war . Though , at the time , I was strapped to a very amusing spaniard named ... You are , of course , Well within your rights to maintain your privacy . Thank you . I agree . A charge of treason , out of context , Is not necessarily what it appears to be . In fact , my involvement with you and mr . Stark could , On the face of it , be considered treasonous . I don 't need to know the details of your past , mr . Jarvis . I appreciate that . Thank you . Our investigators found an open manhole cover They assume the thief came up there . Carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment ? Seems unlikely . You said it rained the night of the break-in . It was a positive deluge . Why ? New york is one of the last cities To still use its sewers to run off storm water . The tide gate opens and the water runs into the river . All mr . Brannis would have needed is a raft and a forecast . He could have floated his stolen treasure all the way to the sea . I 'm heading out . Make sure the chief gets this when he gets back . You got a hit on my passports ? Prince charming 's name is sasha demidov . You might know the rest of the story . He was dead before he died ... battle of ... Wherever ? Finow . Congrats , sousa . You are the brains of the night shift . You ladies have a good night . You know , the passports were a gift from me . Least you could do is cover my shift , you rat bastard . Thought you were gonna ask carter . I was . I did . She acted like I was waving a sock in front of her face . I 'm sure you were polite and respectful as always . You sweet on her , sousa ? Don 't you have enough women in your life to worry about ? All right , I 'm gonna give you A nickel 's worth of free advice , pal . No girl 's gonna trade in a red , white , and blue shield For an aluminum crutch . Your knowledge of waste removal rather surprises me . I spent a week down here in the winter of ' 42 . It was ... another time , perhaps . After all , we all have secrets . I was wrong . I need to know . Miss carter ... If we 're going to be working together , Risking our lives together , Then I must be able to trust you . On my honor , you can . Your honor is not enough . Mr. Stark deemed me worthy of his trust . I would hope that would suffice . Mr. Stark would trust a shark to not bite him If it was wearing a short enough skirt . That 's not entirely relevant . Would it satisfy you to know That the charge of treason was dropped almost immediately ? It 's a start . Before the war , I served under a general . We traveled a great deal . We were in budapest when I met anna . She worked in a hotel tailor shop ... Sold me the most beautiful tie . And then the war broke out , and things became ... Difficult . She was jewish . Still is , I 'm happy to say . The general carried several letters of transit in his safe , Any one of which would have ensured her safety , But he refused to sign . You forged his name . Hence the dishonorable discharge . It was filing the papers that sunk me . I was arrested in the middle of whitehall . Hmm . On a Tuesday . How did anna get out ? The same way I avoided the noose . Howard ? Mr. Stark had unfinished business with the general , And he and I had always got along . When he heard of my predicament , he ... Used his influence . Sounds like a story . Another time , perhaps . Anna obviously knows what howard did for you , But she doesn 't know what you do for him ? Not recently , no . I may not always be truthful with anna , But I am always honest . Difficult balance , that . One that I imagine you know all too well . Here we are . Mr. Brannis couldn 't have gone very far With a whole raft full of volatile technology . Not far at all . Mr. Brannis ' symbol . Well , she looks to have seen better days . It 's still connected to the electric . Someone 's using it . Do you have another one of those ? Someone 's getting very confident . Hmm . Bingo . Careful . Some can be skittish . Very well aware of that . I remember you . Nasty little bugger . What does he do ? The constrictor causes Involuntary catastrophic muscle contraction . Bones break , I 'm afraid . It was originally designed for back massage . Hmm . Right . Let 's call it in . Miss carter , I 'm not sure you 've thought this through . I can 't bloody well leave them here for someone else to find . I 'm not suggesting ... I 'm certainly not turning them over to you To be stolen the next time you feel sleepy . Agent carter , How did you come to discover the stolen items ? Leet brannis , uh , told me where they were . And how did you come into contact with mr . Brannis ? I have been conducting my own private investigation Have you been in contact with him since his disappearance ? Are you collaborating with stark , A known traitor and fugitive from justice ? Publicly revealing these items won 't clear mr . Stark 's name . They 'll only place you under suspicion along with him . Do you see the day I 've had ? I will call them in , and they will respect me . But they won 't . They 'll only use it to tear you down . If you wish to clear mr . Stark 's name , You must do so from the shadows . There 's a phone box across the street . But for god 's sake , don 't let krzeminski get hold of it . Sousa 's working the office tonight . I can just about stomach him getting the credit . Oh , and , uh , mr . Jarvis , they know your voice now . Sousa . Hey , mack , I , uh , Got a hot tip for ya . Yeah , howard stark 's stolen inventions . They 're ... they 're ... they 're on a boat Near the south side pier ... the heartbreak , dock 12 . Who is this ? Just a pal . Tell me you na ... how did you get this number ? Have a lovely night . Right . Very good . Who was that ? Anonymous tip . Let 's go . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . That didn 't take long . Oh . Thought you were someone else . Brannis told me one of you would be coming . One of me ? Would it make a difference if I told you I won 't make it easy ? Yeah . He told me that , too . What did you do ? What did you do to my arm ? Aah ! Well , that works . Not if you want a massage . Jarvis : I imagine that 'll be your colleagues . We must go . We can 't leave him here . He 's a witness . There 's no time . You sure somebody 's not yanking your chain ? There it is . Ssr . Don 't move . Don 't think he can . This is it . We got the stark stuff . That 's like the whole haul . Ease up on that , will you ? I don 't want to end up inside out . We 're getting promotions out of this . Why ? ' cause we answered the phone ? This got handed to us ... again . Somebody 's wrapping this up like it was christmas . Christmas ? Well , hey , who doesn 't love christmas ? I 'm gonna call chief . I want every single box checked and signed in . Careful with that , boys . Hey , keep it sealed off ! You got it ! Who 's our new helpful friend ? Jerome zandow . He had an act in a sideshow at coney island . Petty crimes here and there . Probably just muscle for hire . Even muscle knows something . He had his hands on an arsenal of stark technology , But he just sat there with it . What 's he waiting for ? I 'll get it out of him . Crates are loaded up . I want a lead and a chase car . Don 't do the scenic route . Let 's get it behind ssr walls a.S.A.P. I 'll wake up the eggheads , Start figuring out what the hell this stuff is . And , boys , drive carefully . I don 't want to be the one who sunk manhattan . I don 't envy you , buddy . My pal jack ... he 's got a special gift for interrogations . He 's real convincing , gets guys to spill their guts . That 's not an expression . We 've had to use a mop . I need a doc . My arm 's broke . What 's the point of fixing you up if we 're just gonna break you again ? Was that dame working for you ? What dame ? The one on the boat ... English broad , solid right hook . English ? Yeah . What 's she look like ? ♪ let 's jam that boogie , babe ♪ Ohh , damn it ! What the ... ? ♪ why don 't you come back ♪ ♪ let 's jam that boogie ♪ W-watch where you 're going .

You realize could happen anytime , any day . How did it happen ? Professional hit . Him and our only witness . Must have been watching us at the scene . I knew something was fishy about that anonymous tip . Who does that ? A concerned citizen ? Concerned citizens call the cops . This guy called us directly . It 's not like we 're in the phonebook . Somebody targeted them , and I 'm gonna find that bastard . Whatever happened last night , don 't any of you forget ... Krzeminski would still be with us today If it wasn 't for howard stark , Whether he pulled the trigger or not . We 're only neck-deep in this mess because of him . I want action plans on my desk in one hour . Stay vigilant . I 'm not losing any more of you . Now I got to go call krzeminski 's wife .

Granted , he did just knock off a newsstand , but still . Big shock . Oh , uh ... I don 't know why it 's hit me so hard . We weren 't close . He was ... A brute , a cheat . He was disrespectful , rude ... But he was good at his job . I 'm really sorry , honey . What can I do ? Man : Miss , could I get a refill ? Um ... Do you still have that schnapps ? Miss ?

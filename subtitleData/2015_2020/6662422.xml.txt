 Tom ? They come to help us or to finish the job ? In the jeep . Now . We do not know who blew that plane . Here is the answer . Go Go go ! - Weapons ? - In the bag . Warning ! Received . 25 miles nautical from the coast , near 20.60 North ... 106.94 East . I just got off the phone with the Vietnamese government . Eight of their security team have been killed outside a nightclub . We sent in the James Vietnam to send a message . Peng has responded in kind . The aircraft captain will be in one of Chandler safe airspace in less than four hours . We will know something more than Peng when we talk with him . The James is safely away from the Vietnamese coast . They are in radio silence , awaiting further instructions . Still nothing from the sailors disappeared ? No , sir . Who the hell 's in charge here ? Damn . My soldier need a doctor . The bandage is not stopping the bleeding . Let me take a look . Hey , hey , hey . If we 're hostages , You do not want to lose one . Hey , remove them your hands off me ! I want to talk to the man in charge ! I want to talk to the man in charge ! Hold on , Mason . Hold on , man . - We 'll help you . - Does anyone speak English ? He needs help . It needs help ! Do not remain standing there ! I can help you if you give me the material ! Hold on , man . Give me the material ! Hold on . The Last Ship 3x02 Rising Sun Hong Kong , China { \ an8 } I repeat , this is Zephyr . Alpha Team , come in . Someone of Alfa Team , here is Zephyr . Sure this is the right channel ? The canal is right , and it 's all the week is free . - Team Alfa , Zephyr . Answer . - We used high-frequency radio waves . They are safe . If you do not respond , it 's because he killed them Peng , the son of a ... Hey ! Do you want me to drive ? I 'll be fine , sir . Let 's get out of this hell . Hey , communications go in this area . - The phones do not work . - Not even the radio . - I can not help it . - Let 's get out of here . Thank you . Very nice . We must return to the our ship . Thank you . Clothes so we are the easy targets . We have to change our clothes before reaching the pier . Mate , no radar or visual contact ? No , sir . - Nothing ? - No , and local frequencies are clear . They had all the radios , and not find a contact . - It must have been a quick attack . - He 's right . We should warn them before . It was a difficult decision . Ok . St. Louis told us to stay off , but did not say staying here to do nothing . He wants to find the boat ? They disappeared near the bay an hour before the attack . If we follow them , we risk not to be recovered . If ours are on those ships , we still have a chance to recover them . Mate , 1-8-5 route to Do Son . Rudder hard left , maintaining 1-8-5 route . Damn . I can not see a fucking without glasses . I need some pliers . I need the pliers ! Pliers ! Not enough rags and gauze . Green ran off . Maybe ... even Burk . No doubt . Probably will be returned already on James . They had the EMP . That 's how disrupted communications . I know , son . I know . What are they doing ? They take him away ? No , no , no , no ! Stop ! Stop ! No , no ! This man can not be moved . This man can not be moved ! Put it back on the ground ! No ! No ! Son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch ! Maybe they have the find a doctor . They are trying . It eight account . It wants to live , do not you ? Which gives us an advantage . We have to catch a couple live . If we want to find out where are our . Sir ? The Shackleton and Hayward will dock Okinawa in less than three hours . I suggest you make them supply them immediately and having them leave for Hai Phong . Yes , we will refuel , but maybe we 'll need to investigate the mutation the virus in Japan . Do not forget the main reason why we sent Chandler in Asia . Not prudent to consider sending other people in that region without having a clear vision of the situation , sir . Mister President ... someone has kidnapped our thirteen . I do not care if it was Peng , the Vietnamese or the pirates , James is still there without his captain , nor his Deputy . They are alone ! When James comes out by radio silence , communications will be handled as best we can . The background noise can be dealt with , but we have no videos . Val was working there before I left , but ... - Trying to figure it out too . - Okay . And if you 're right , Alex , if it was Peng , could be a trap to bring in one place our only three in the West Pacific destroyers . I agree . We wait for news by Captain Chandler . Meantime ... undisclosed news . I got it ? Yup . What makes you think that your friend is willing to help us ? It was a pilot Doctors Without Borders . One of the best ever known . When the plague struck not managed to escape from China , but still likely to remain plagued to deliver aid in remote areas . Before the advent Peng , I used my contacts to help her get into the hardest hit areas . We smuggled food , gasoline , supplies of all kinds . When Peng took power and you have brought the cure , it happened to me a role ... diplomatic . A Jesse did not . It 's a bit ' paranoid when it comes to meeting new people , why do not you wait here ? I talk to you first . Jesse ? Jesse ! You think about it ? Yes , sir . Jesse ? Jesse ? Hello , Sasha . Christ , Jesse ! Who are they , your henchmen ? You have come to end the job for Peng ? But what you 're saying ? - Do not you know ? - I do not know anything . Guangzhou ... that little hell of that no one had to know anything ? When we arrived crawling with Chinese soldiers ! If I had said that Peng was shifting its missiles , We would not have fallen straight into a trap ! But I did not know - Peng who were moving the missiles ! - Then we had bad luck , or someone told him we were coming . Because there was Lau Hu waiting . My brother ... all my friends ... - They were killed . - Jesse , I did not know anything . - You gotta believe me ! - I believe you ? You 've already got a suite luxury in residence Peng ... or you moved into the master bedroom ? Hey . You know who I am ? I came here to prevent Peng to accumulate nursing doses . He just tried to kill me ... indeed , to kill us all . I think anyone with me right now playing fair . And Homeland Security 's ten minutes from us . I 'm really sorry for your friends , I too have lost too much . And for all I know , Peng 's pissing on their graves at this time , but now your cover is blown . So we had to leave all . We need the helicopter . Damn ! Let 's go . Sonar ? - Still nothing , sir . - And we are far from the coast . - We have something on radar . - I have it also on the sonar . It is a ship ? It is sending a trade signal identifying the system as a fishing boat , but ... It is not one of the three ships we had seen before . Sonar , give me a pair of headphones . I hear the sound of an engine . It 's the same ship that is identified as a Chinese fishing boat Class B ? Yes , sir , I think so , sir . You can change your signal , but not your engine clatter . Gator , order the helmsman to bring us together . Roger that . - News of the other two ships ? - No , sir . It 's been five hours . They could be gone by now . Who I am ? They do not seem to Vietnamese . They look like a hodgepodge . I heard them talking in Thai and Chinese . There were written in Chinese on the side of the frigate . Are you okay , boy ? Yes , I just seasickness . This ship moves much more than James . Bend your knees , move them to your chest and close your eyes . Every 60 seconds riaprile and count to 5 Then do it again . Le 4 : 32 . We are at sea by how much ? About 3 hours ? We 're going from 12 to Direction ? How it moves the ship , if the wind is still from the East , towards South-East , shall we ? We move away from China . We move away from Vietnam . Where are they taking him ? They come all eight . Two live Lasciamone . We , Danny Boy ! I have just killed one ! Now they are two ! And with these they make four . I do not speak your language , you asshole . Damn it , we 're seven . Tell me the last still breathing . That ship is 1.3 nautical miles north-north-west of our position . Deck officer , full speed ahead . Viriamo and intercept that ship . Climb on board and find out where are our men . Fishing boat at 6 kilometers Southeast of Do Son peninsula , Here is the US warship who calls you on channel 1-6 . Passage . Fishing boat at 6 km in Southeast ... They are moving and increase speed . In North-West , in the direction 3-4-0 . Mate , change the route . 3-4-0 . The 're wearing . Hey , could you put out your cigarette ? Are you afraid that you may lung cancer ? We have bigger problems , right ? Homeland Security is 10 minutes from us . Maybe . Or maybe not . I mean , even Peng tried to kill us , if it 's any consolation . As you are silent . I 'm thinking . I know that face . You 're not thinking . You 're thoughtful . You must understand , Mr. President , that people behaved in some way to survive . And now she wants to change everything . These ration cards are becoming a thorny issue . I understand this is difficult , but if all this has taught us one thing It is that the American people can adapt . Clearly , its moon honey is about to end . - It has the support of the people . - People have a very short memory . And you realize that out there , on the streets , people give credit to Chandler a to Dr. Scott . My wife has been to the market , today . In the store you 're a guy who wanted to buy six boxes of cereal . She has enough money , but his rations for the week say that it is up to him only . Then look on the shelves and sees that there are three hundred boxes . Half of those grains will go bad . This people ... They held up their regions only with tenacity and courage for almost a year . The way they see it ... if the treatment had come there instead of here , It would be one of them to command , now . What nonsense . Beatty was a senator and Castillo owned a limousine company . And Michener was a secretary of the Cabinet . Approved by Congress . - And so is the President . - He was not elected . And not just forget ... He is immune . I know you voters do not like , but it comes to earn or share . If this man has more than he needs , must send him where there is lack of resources . We 're doing everything we can , Mr. President . But is asking people to change their basic principles of how it should work our society . The rationing is not in the DNA of Americans . I understand what you mean , gentlemen . Captain Chandler should be in a safe airspace , but we have no news of the plane . We tested it with Sasha Cooper and our security team in Hong Kong . No response from them either . Between what the plane is expected to Pearl Harbor ? In five and a half hours . As we speak , our ships are sourcing in Okinawa . We do not consider this option . Keep trying with the plane . Yes , ma 'am . Do not warm up , Alex . You do not want to admit it , but he has so much trouble to be solved here . The way it will handle this foreign crisis ... He must do so with great resolve . I understand your concern , gentlemen , but you 'll have to be patient . The course of action is decided . Where 's the boat ? 60 miles to the South-West . The boat goes to 30 knots . Stables on him . 30 knots ? It is a fishing boat . Go to Cat Ba . There is a channel too narrow for us . If circumnavigassimo the island , we could intercept them at dawn . Mate , the helm hard left . We intercept them on the other side . Helm hard left . Peng reconnaissance teams everywhere , in these waters . Just so she can keep it hidden . Once in Kowloon , I have a van to use hidden . I hope for your good that it is still there . Also for your . I do not care . - I have no reason to live . - Hey ... We have all lost virtually everything . If you really want to hit Peng , this should be the only thing that matters . First , the apartment , you asked me to wait outside . You wanted to meet her for the first to keep her from talking . You have not only smuggled food and gasoline before the rise of Peng . Care also . And it happened well after the arrival of Peng ... While you are working as diplomatic . I stopped a few weeks ago , when the situation precipitated . You mad at me since then . Rivera knows ? And the President ? Of course not . I not would lay them so much , and in this way . You always have to do things your way . Sasha always knows what to do . They were to be unaware , and in any case I had no way to tell him . There are secure communications between Hong Kong and the United States . Do you understand that maybe that 's why my men have been affected ? Do you think that Vietnam is retaliation for what I have done with Jesse ? Do not forget my plane . If Peng had known something , He would have done killed on the spot . Like you said , he planning long-term ... He would not kill her just I was gone . I 'm sorry for your men , Tom ... but you have to believe me when I tell you behind there is something bigger that smuggling of care to me and that girl . Who do you work ? For the Government ? Who do you work ? For the Chinese ? For who ? Are we really sure it 's Vietnamese ? On this blade engraved different characters . We 're almost in the open sea . Tell me that we can see that boat . I 'm hooking them right now . I have them along the trajectory Sailing between islands . The seabed there is at 4 meters . Curse . - Maneuvering speed , mate . - Full ahead , to 1 / 3 to 3 knots . I lost them again . They 're gone . I hear you 're a good driver . What it takes to get to your helicopter ? You 're becoming impatient . I was thinking more programs for today . - What 's that ? - Welcome to Hong Kong . I never saw a checkpoint here . Try us . Eat . Eat ! Eat ! Filet mignon ... and apricots ? Before , when I have accompanied to the bathroom , I could see the rest of the crew . They were eating beans from a jar . I 'm sorry , guys . We have to give him something to drink . It needs water . Water . Also give a clean would not go amiss . Water . What do you do ? - Hey , hey ! Hey , no ! - Where are you going ? - What are you doing ? Leave him . - He just wants to drink ! Leave him ! It 's just a boy ! Bring your friend to get some fresh air . Now ... you eat . Stay down ! Jesus , Sasha . - I said stay down . - And I hear you . Just a bunch of stuff at random . I can not understand where they come from . How are you ? I 'm fine . It 's him I 'm worried about . Make him an ass like you doing in the Middle Ages . I wait . He 's going into shock . Hey ! Hey ! Stay with me ! Stay with me ! He ... He is losing ... blood . He said that you lose blood . As ? Do you speak my language ? He will not be pleased . But who the hell is this ? Who ? Who will not be pleased ? Who do you work for ? Who sent you , eh ? Curse ! Now we go to the south , I think . It seems that we turn in circles . They do not want to find out where we are . Unless there are not going nowhere . Unless there are not just holding here . Be good , boys . Be right back . We left behind a lot of corpses . How long will it take the Security Inner before chasing us ? The checkpoints do report every half hour . When Peng will not call , send reinforcements . ALL OFFENDERS WILL BE SUED CHINESE BY LAW . DANGER ! This area is radioactive . There is a nuclear power plant ten kilometers inland . And there has been a loss ? I would say more of a meltdown . A few months ago . No one has been able to activate the security protocols . So it is here that keeps his helicopter ? It takes 9 minutes to get there . That leaves us 11 minutes to take off - Before the radiation kill us . - 11 minutes ? More or less . Sir , I 'm on the phone with Pearl Harbor . They can not find the plane with the radar . It does not respond to their calls . Mr. President , there 's a phone call from Hong Kong . He is the chairman Peng . - President Peng . - Mr President , I realize that there is very late , and I 'm sorry to give her other worries over Vietnam . No . No . He has news for us ? I 'm afraid so . It seems that the plane Captain Chandler in a serious failure to engines while he is attempting takeoff from our airport . Unfortunately , the plane crashed . The plane crashed ? There are survivors ? We 're looking into the water right now ... but with little hope . We been precisely sought . It 's certainly very suspicious , Mr. President , after what happened in Vietnam . Like I said , in the region operate many elements outside the law . At first we suspected pirates , but your pilot reported to engine problems . We are sending the transmission between your pilot and the control tower . Yes . Of course we are very interested to hear the recording . I assure you that will conduct a thorough investigation and we keep you informed . Thank you , President Peng , and I will call you soon . - You will not believe it , do you ? - I do not want to jump to conclusions , and you should not do it either you . We listen to the broadcast . Your delays have put me in a bad position with the Americans . If Chandler is found alive , it will be at war with the United States . Find him , goddamn it . You stole a helicopter Chinese military ? We are in China . What did you expect ? - That charge does ? - Approximately 1000 km . - Simply just to get to Hai Phong . - It depends on the winds . Are you OK ? - Just a little ' sick . - Maybe we should get out of here . Well , fasten your seat belts . - Launch grenades ? - Better safe than sorry . Shit . - It 's a joke , right ? - We start with the cables ? Take the battery and the terminals of the car . You can not connect a battery 28 volt to a 12 . There is an old van on the other side of the generator . We also use that . Homeland Security 's coming . - Want to make a chain ? - Yes . I will take time . Here we are ! The turbines do not go fast enough . I can not keep them in bay for much longer ! Try now ! I started the generator . Hurry and bring your ass on board . Come on , Captain ! Everything is alright ? Have you by any chance with you a Geiger counter ? It seems to me been a week . We were under the arch ... To distribute the cure . It is possible that Peng is lying . Did you hear the transmission from the cockpit . The Air Force Captain confirmed the rumors . We are currently out of 16-mile position , sir . Damn . Deck officer , sees something ? Negative , sir . Anything ? No sign of them or our . We have to get back in position for saving . I would never have to go to the damn party . The entire high command down the ship at the same time ... We were on a diplomatic mission . Cameron is more than suitable . Burk and Green find them ... And they will find us . Rockets forward , green-red-green signal . 3-5-0 route , but away at least 10 miles . It 's our sequence , are parties . TAO , I want a scan Full radar and sonar area . Deck officer , we head in that direction . Twenty degrees right , 3-5-0 route . I hope you 're right about that ship because we 're running out of gas and in 10 minutes we will be dry . The commander said he would have been within 20 miles of Hai-Pong . We should be radio remote now . Forget it . She 's gone . The points suitable for extraction have this , this and this . But it will take at least 20 minutes to get there . Hey , Burky , where the hell are they ? They should be closer to shore . New contact surface in 0-4-0 direction one nautical mile . With 2-4-5 route to 35 knots . Bridge , here TAO . Confirmed AIS signals . The enemy ship has returned . Everyone to battle stations , ready to attack his signal . - Missiles and cannons , sir . - Negative , TAO . We do not shoot . Could be hostages on board . We should change course to intercept them . Blocchiamoli before our reach . Agree . Officer blanket , direction 0-2-0 . - Engines at most . - Yes , sir . Helmsman , 20 degrees to the right . They go to the islands . They resemble ours . CCS , disable all secure . Come into operation continuously . We will cut the road . It 's time to think of to another destination . Tell me that at least the radar works . - Do not touch it . - Sasha . Your ship will see that we are Chinese . They will think that we want to attack them . Do not you think I know that ? - There must be another way . - A problem at a time . You two go to bed together ? Turn it on . Aircraft in unknown approaching from 0-8-0 . 110 knots . Lord , come ! Looks like a Chinese helicopter . Here is James . It is 10 miles east-southeast . What are you doing ? I greet them . The aircraft changed the its transponder code . 1-2-0-9 . - 1-2-0-9 ... - anything to you ? - No , no . It 's impossible . - What ? It is the Chief of Naval Operations ! On December 9 is his birthday . Sometimes he used that code as ID . The Chief of Naval Operations ? Here ? On a Chinese helicopter ? 30 seconds we lose touch . Warn the guys on the boat . Let them know that they are in danger . Hold on , man ! We 're almost home . Warning to one hour . I would say that red is not a good sign . No . There seem to be two of our boys on a speedboat . They are chasing them ! We have to help them . Go ahead ! We dry . We have to land . I said go ! Hey , look out ! Look out ! Draw near more . Covering fire ! They are arriving ! Yup ! Yup !

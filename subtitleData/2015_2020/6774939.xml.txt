 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Lucy , look at you . What happened ? We shouldn 't have used the Darkhold . That book can fix us . You can 't let him touch you . You 'll go crazy . [ Gasps ] You saved a friend of mine from a guy my bullets went straight through . You 're the only one we know that can hurt those things . You know someone that worked at that Momentum facility ? - My uncle . - Doing time at South Ridge Penitentiary ? He always said the guy he beat up was the real criminal . - Who is she ? - Dr. Lucy Bauer . Joseph 's wife . They were the project leaders at this privately funded think tank . - What is she after ? - She 's gonna go after the book . Coulson : It 's called the Darkhold . Look , I know you two like to work alone . You don 't need us ? Fine . Right now , we need you . Do you have any idea where to start ? Joseph Bauer . He 's been in a coma all these years . Well , he just woke up . Where 's the book ? 4x05 - Lockup [ Lock disengages ] [ Doors creak ] Joseph : Well , Lucy , this has to be it . Mildew and cobwebs . You know , this reminds me of Outer Mongolia . [ Chuckles ] You got to admit , the yurt was kind of romantic . And we were so sure it was there . - So ... what are the odds that it 's here ? - In the family home of the guy who killed the last person who had it ? [ Chuckling ] We 've never been this close . Well , we 've said that before . What if we spent all these years doing the science instead of looking for shortcuts ? If we did the actual work ... Whoa . This is weird . [ Stone scraping ] Is it ... [ Laughs ] [ Both laugh ] - Okay . - Here . Wait . What the ... ? Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? [ Exhales sharply ] I didn 't think it would be in German . No , I 'm reading English . Wait . Are you not seeing what I 'm seeing ? Joe , German is your first language . - Y-Yes , but this is not possible . - Unless ... What if , in some way , it is reading ... us ? [ Suspenseful music plays ] [ Chuckling ] - Coulson : Dr. Bauer , stay with us ! - Get away ! Get away from me ! Get away ! I see what you are . Focus , Dr. Bauer . We need your help . You ... You 're demons . You 're demons . You 've come to take me away . You 've come to take me away . She was here ... your wife , Lucy . Dr. Bauer , please . We don 't want anyone else getting hurt . It was a mistake . We never should have taken it . We should 've left it buried . - The book ? - We need to know where it is . You can 't have it . Get away from me . Get away ! [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] Get away ! - Nurse : Stand back please ! - Get away ! - Dr. Bauer , please , where is the book ? - Sir please , I need you to stay back . I buried it back where I found it ! [ Music ] [ Gasps ] [ Exhales sharply ] You 're too late . She knows . [ Flatline ] No . No . No . No , no , no , no , no ! N-o-o-o-o ! Mack : If this thing is that dangerous , then why not tell him ? He 's the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. - We don 't know if we can trust him . - So why the hell is he here ? Without him , we wouldn 't know the Darkhold had resurfaced . But the fewer people who know about it , the better . Fury had no problem opening up Pandora 's Box from time to time , but even he was afraid of this thing . It 's powerful , it 's deadly , and now probably in the hands of a pissed-off mad-scientist ghost . So , thoughts , feelings ? This is a safe space . We need another crack at Eli Morrow . He 's the one that knows this book . He 'll know what Lucy Bauer wants with it - and where she 's going next . - My uncle is not gonna talk to you . Well , then this time , we won 't give him a choice . Let 's inform S.H.I.E.L.D. we 're taking an asset into protective custody as part of a routine investigation . May , want to go to prison ? Could be Taco Tuesday . I 'll call the warden and find out . Lucy leaves a lot of crazy in her wake . If we 're gonna track her down , we 're gonna need that antidote . Fitz said that they were close . I don 't want it close . I want it here . Wait . If we 're going to get my uncle , I 'm going with you . - No , you 're not . - If your uncle can lead us to Lucy , then maybe we 'll let you out to bust some ghosts , but until then , your ass stays on the plane . - I don 't take orders . - Then this will be a new experience . - You can 't keep me here . - Maybe not . But you take this plane down , you 'll be burning up the only people in the world trying to help you . He 's growing on me . You ? [ Music ] Robbie : I need to get off this plane now . That should put you in ... rural Utah . - And you think you 're pissed off now ... - This is no joke . All right ? I should be down there , getting answers , my way . Oh , yeah ? How you gonna do that ? - Cracking skulls ? - It 's worked so far . - Really ? - I 've been careful . I 've never been caught , not even a parking ticket . Then you show up , and you bring S.H.I.E.L.D. with you . Careful ? Really ? You 've been murdering people while possessed and on fire . You don 't know what you 're talking about . I know you 're settling scores , hoping that thing will go away . How 's that going for you ? Look , Robbie , I get that this is personal for you . But if you want answers , you need to trust S.H.I.E.L.D. You don 't even trust them . Why else are you up here hiding from them ? I keep my distance because it 's what 's best ... for everyone . I 'm starting to see why . [ Music ] Fitz : We can learn a lot when someone dies , as was the case when you and Radcliffe killed Agent May . Actually , that was less of a killing and more of a-a full system reboot , which is brilliant . And her brain scan allowed us to create an antidote . [ Exhales sharply ] Bold strokes . Well-played . Excuse me ? [ Tablet beeps ] Thank you . I think we 're gonna need bold strokes , 'cause , apparently , that thing that Lucy Bauer 's after , Coulson is saying it 's pretty serious . - Something called the Darkh ... - All right , stop . - Not another word . - At least you finally said one to me . I have my lie-detection today , and I do not want another secret . Along with Daisy , Robbie Reyes , and your pet project Aida ... Oh , come on . How many times have I got to say it ? The polygraph is the reason - I didn 't say anything . - Forget the polygraph . - This isn 't about the polygraph ! - What was I supposed to do ? We 're supposed to share everything ! We share a bed , but this whole time , you were lying there , keeping things from me . Oh , come on . I wanted to tell you , of course . I ... and ... and I-I knew - that you 'd think she was fascinating ... - It . It 's fascinating . And now it is going to get me sacked . Did you know there are over 212 micro-expressions that can betray a lie ? One eye dart to the left , and I 'm finished . Unlike some people , I 'm terrible at keeping secrets . So ... it is about the polygraph . All right , well , okay . Well , look , I 'll just stay here , and I 'll help you practice . We could do the ... the penny in the shoe thing - and the thumbtack under the tongue . - It 's the other way around . And no , just go . Coulson needs you . I 'll work it out . I am not getting fired today . Hey , no eye dart to the left . I 100 % bought that . All right , I 'll see you later , then . [ Sighs ] Who am I kidding ? They 'll skip right over the firing part and throw me behind bloody bars . _ [ Music ] You know , I ask for field work , you give me paperwork . What 's wrong with taking it easy ? [ Sighs ] Come on . You had a near-death experience . It was a death experience . I 'm over it . Well , I 'm really not over mine . I thought you 'd want to talk about it . - You know , what it felt like . - Didn 't feel like a trip to Tahiti . Which means it was something else . [ Cabinet beeps , lock clicks ] See , I died , but anything I would 've seen or felt was wiped away . I don 't remember anything , but you do . - What do you want to know , Phil ? - What did you see ? - Seriously ? - Yeah . - No . W ... - Agents , follow me . So , we 're transferring into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody one Elias Morrow . Everything should be in order . Agent May called ahead just to cut down on paperwork . She really hates paperwork . Don 't you ? Yeah . We 'll get this taken care of . One last thing . Coulson ! [ Gun cocks ] You can 't fool me , you demons ! [ Gun cocks , gunshot ] [ Gun clicking ] Aah ! [ Gunshots ] - Demons everywhere ! - Incoming ! - Demons ! - Demons ! I 'm gonna state the obvious . Dr. Bauer 's here , and we need to get to Eli Morrow before she does . - Our ICERs are in lockup . - Mack , do you read me ? The prison 's compromised . Mack : Let me guess ... Lucy Bauer ? Lucy and the whole " Peanuts " gang . So ... she has friends . We 'll have to assume they 're targeting Eli Morrow . Targeting ? Well , he put her husband in a coma , right ? Coulson and May are barricaded in the Warden 's office , here , on the west side . And Eli Morrow is located in the east wing , here , in cellblock E. We 'll split into two teams . Daisy , you lead a team to extract Coulson and May . - I 'll lead a team to grab Eli . - I 'm going . This is my family . You have no reason to keep me out of this . Because you only kill people that deserve it . - Exactly . - Well , down there , everyone deserves it , so you stay put . No , we need an advantage down there . It 's him . We can 't even touch these things . He can kill them . You said if you needed some ghosts busted ... Okay . But you don 't leave my sight . And just so we 're clear , this is an ICERs-only op . Anyone could have the psychosis , so they can 't be held responsible for their actions . Now , S.H.I.E.L.D. is marshaling forces to control the perimeter , but that 's hours away . Right now , we 're the only ones going in , - and we 'll be outnumbered . - Works for me . [ Device beeping ] Fitz 's Quinjet is five minutes out . That means we leave in six . Gear up . [ Music ] - You sure you 're up for this ? - Let 's find out . Yeah , new and improved gauntlets , but Simmons said if you quake ... I could shatter every bone in my body and be crippled for life ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . - Daisy ... I 'm not gonna risk it . Besides , I didn 't always have powers , and ... - I did all right . - Cases of sanity , as ordered . Hey , I 'm gonna need you up here quarterbacking us on comms . " Quarterbacking " ? Yeah , it means that you , uh ... you call the plays . Oh . Well , see , I was under the impression it was - the coaches who called the plays . - Well ... And that 's why American footballers need those little radio things in their ears to tell them what to do - for the few minutes that they 're on the field . - Yeah . Got it , Coach . So , these work like EpiPens ? Fitz : Almost , but more efficient . To counteract the psychosis , the serum needs to be delivered directly into the brain stem , so ... the injector ... needs to be placed at the base of the skull . Oh-ho-ho , no . Now , you know I don 't like needles . Well , I mean , it 's a bee sting , really . Oh , hell ... [ Music ] - Where are the guards ? - That 's a good question . Keep your heads down . [ Gun cocks ] Not all of them will be friendly . Yes , sir . Harlan : A few more questions . Agent Simmons , are you now , or have you ever been , - a member of Hydra ? - Absolutely . What ? On assignment , undercover . My allegiance has always been to S.H.I.E.L.D. Almost done . Have you ever obtained sensitive information that you are obligated to report up the Security Spectrum or to the Director ? [ Polygraph machine beeps ] Agent Simmons , would you like me to repeat the question ? No , it 's j ... it 's very wide-ranging . Mace : Agent Simmons . I 'm gonna need you to come with me . Now . Man : Hey , who are you guys ? ! How 's it looking , Coach ? Where the C.O.s at ? ! Fitz : Well , from what I can tell , Lucy and her cohorts are searching cell by cell for Eli Morrow , which means they don 't know where he is . Mack : Oh . That 's good . Yeah , except I have now lost them . So they 're either avoiding the cameras or they 've reverted to a halituous state . - Say what ? - A hali ... They 've gone all ghostly . - Smart . - Yeah . Well , they are scientists . They tend to think strategically in these situations . That 's what makes us such formidable adversaries . Mack : At least they haven 't infected the prisoners . _ _ _ This is not the objective . _ Come back any time , G. I didn 't bring you down here to settle scores . - I 'm good . - Really ? 'Cause I don 't think you can control that thing inside of you . And if I have to shoot you to keep him from coming out ... I will . [ Music ] We 're here to , uh ... rescue you ? Thought we 'd meet you halfway . - Do we have Eli Morrow ? - Not yet . Then we back up Mack and Robbie . Agents , we need Warden Green and his C.O.s lucid if we 're gonna retake this place . Plus , the " demon " conversation gets stale . Copy that . - Aah ! - Stop whining . I know it 's a little public , but it 's the fastest route to Eli 's cell . Believe me . [ Music ] - Coulson . - Coulson : I see it , too . It 's how they 're organizing . All the new Watchdogs , they 're recruiting in prison , uniting against us . Man : Hey , you seeing this ? It 's S.H.I.E.L.D. They protect those freaks . - Which one of you 's the freak ? - Come on , let 's go . Hey , stop . [ Locks disengage ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Prisoners talking ] Fitz , we could really use that exit . If I release the door , all the doors in cellblock A open . - The s-security wings , the exterior exits ... - Just do it ! [ Console beeping ] Go , go ! [ Prisoners shouting ] I get it . You and Phil Coulson are close . I 'm the new Director , your boss , so you think there are things that I don 't need to know . But I do . - Agent Simmons , can I trust you ? - Definitely . Great , ' cause , boy , do I need your help . [ Chuckles ] I 'm debating Senator Nadeer on television about the " Inhuman War on Humans . " I hate that the media 's calling it that . Burrows says it 's terrible branding . But either way , this is a battle for hearts and minds . - What can I do ? - Facts , Simmons . I need cold , hard , scientific facts to back up our case during this debate . I can put together a PowerPoint on , um , Inhuman genetics , biology , sociological impact ... Yeah , here 's the thing . I think it might be better if I literally had what 's in your head ... in my head . [ Chuckles nervously ] Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn 't have that kind of technology . Oh , sure it does . Ah . So , all you need to do is listen in , tell me exactly what to say , and know that any error , slip-up , or mishap could endanger the lives of humans and Inhumans alike . Ah . [ Chuckles ] Also , we 're live in 15 minutes . - About back there ... - Forget it . Uh , I can 't do that . That thing inside you is my responsibility . - No , it 's mine . - And if you can 't control it ? Look . My uncle can 't know what I am . So I 'll keep it down . Not for you , for him . I need you to do something for me . Duck ! Ghost busted . [ Groans ] [ Screaming ] Unless your face also does a-a Clown Posse thing , I 'm infected . Give me some space . [ Breathing heavily ] Aah ! Are you okay ? Can you hear me ? Mm . Mm ! Yep . You can back off the mike . Copy that , sir . Woman : Everyone set ? Quiet , please . We 're about ready to roll . Man : Our end is live in 4 , 3 , 2 ... [ Triumphant music plays ] Stephanopoulos : Many of you are familiar with Senator Ellen Nadeer . She 's head of the Finance Committee and outspoken advocate of the so-called Humans First movement . Thank you for having me . And of course , our next guest needs little introduction . He is a patriot , a public servant known all over the world . He put his life on the line to save others during the U.N. bombing in Vienna . He 's now the Director of the newly reformed S.H.I.E.L.D. ... - Jeffrey Mace . - It 's an honor to be here , George . Let 's get started . Director Mace ... After an intro like that , I think I deserve some equal time . - I 'd like to ask the Director a question . - Go ahead , Senator . Just what is S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s purpose if it 's not protecting us from the Inhumans ? Why are human lives not S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s priority ? Actually , Inhumans and humans share 99.8 % of the human genome . Inhumans are human , and the science is in agreement with me . In fact , we share 99.8 % of the human genome . It really is that close . I had no idea . - It really is , George ... - Genetics can 't explain the blackouts that plunged parts of the world into darkness . People were terrorized . Lives were lost . - Two people died in a helicopter crash ... - Let us never forget while 17 Inhumans were murdered . ... that more Inhumans than humans were lost during that crisis . And yet every day , there are reports of disturbances in Hong Kong or blue-skinned killers in Wyoming . Well , if I was to respond to every tabloid story and ... and ... and Sasquatch sighting , I couldn 't do my job , which is to protect this great nation . What about the very real situation happening right now outside of Los Angeles ? Is it true that S.H.I.E.L.D. has compromised a prison ? We have ... no data on that , do we ? It 's our policy not to comment on ongoing operations , but I can assure you that S.H.I.E.L.D. has the situation completely under control . Let 's go , go , go , go ! [ Door slams ] Come on , come on , come on ! Fitz : Coulson , the exit is on the north side . I 'm gonna try and get you - to a secure cellblock . - There ! [ Prisoners shouting ] Let 's go ! We 're gonna make it ! Man : Come on ! Come on ! Let 's go ! May ! Go through ! - You 're gonna make it . - What ? Daisy , no ! Open the door ! This is my fight , not yours . - Don 't do this ! - Damn it ! [ Whistles ] Here , boy . Fitz , change of plans . Find us another way into the cafeteria . I don 't care how . Get them ! [ Dramatic music plays ] Aah ! [ Prisoners shouting ] Hey ! Where are the guards ? ! Where are the guards ? ! - Tío . - Robbie , what are you doing here ? - We 're getting you out of here . - What ? [ Device beeps ] Step back , please . - No , no , don 't . This is S.H.I.E.L.D. ? - You 're in danger . Lucy Bauer is here , and she 's coming for you . Robbie , I told you to stay away from this . Mr. Morrow , Dr. Bauer can walk through walls , so we got to go . Walk through walls ? Yeah , S.H.I.E.L.D. said she had abilities . Yeah , and now we think she has that book . So who knows what else she 's capable of . The book ? Yeah . Let 's go . [ Shouting continues ] People are scared that Inhumans don 't share our core values . And who could blame them ? How many of our citizens have died under S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s watch ? Fatalities have decreased since the signing of the Sokovia Accords . We 're proud to say that fatalities have actually decreased sharply since the signing of the Sokovia Accords . It 's a legacy I hope to build on . Treaties mean nothing to the Inhumans . - We 're dealing with something different here . - Senator , when you say " different , " that sounds like a dog whistle aimed at hate groups . There 's no dog whistle needed , George . Just the word " Inhuman " is frightening enough , and yet they choose to define themselves that way . See , that kind of comment , uh , illustrates the problem . If we can 't talk about Inhumans with respect ... You can 't talk about them with honesty . How can people trust you ? [ Chuckles ] Director Mace , you take a damn good photo , I 'll give you that , but that doesn 't make you the man for this job . Simmons : Stick to the facts . - Since S.H.I.E.L.D. has been re ... - Hmm . [ Earpiece beeps ] So , you don 't think I 'm the man for the job . [ Music ] Well ... I became the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. because I believe in their mission . Protecting and integrating Inhumans is part of that . Senator , I promise you that I am the man for the job , because I 'm not just a man . I 'm an Inhuman . Director Mace , just to be sure I 'm hearing you correctly , you 're saying you are literally Inhuman ? [ Crew murmuring ] Yes . I 'm an Inhuman . You know , my life didn 't just change when that bomb went off in Vienna or when I shielded that woman from harm . It also changed when I went through Terrigenesis . So , yeah , this is personal . And people like me that are different should not be hunted down . Fitz : I 'm sorry , but it 's the fastest way in . Yeah , and , um , you 're looking for the chute - in the northwest corner . - Got it . Whoa . Guess it really is Taco Tuesday . - Yeah . - You know , you never did tell me - what you saw when you died . - Really ? Now ? Is it because it smells like death in here ? You saw something . - You want to know what I saw , Phil ? - Yeah . I saw you . Don 't let it go to your head . [ Clank ] You didn 't think of that before I jumped in the trash ? What 's the fun in that ? [ Dramatic music plays ] Man : Finish her ! You 're done ! [ Gasping ] [ Grunts ] It 's been a while since I stretched my legs . That was suicidal and stupid . And you weren 't supposed to come back for me . - We just saved your life ! - And risked your own ! I never asked for that . Let 's argue about who should 've left who to die later . - You need a medic . - I 'll be fine ... Fine ? No . You won 't . Fitz , what 's the status on Eli Morrow ? Quinjet 's on its way to the yard for extraction . Mack has him in his custody . [ Music ] [ Prisoners shouting ] [ Growls ] [ Sighs ] Mack : The exit 's just ahead . [ Alarm blaring ] [ Coughing ] Man : Hey . A little help here . All right , get Eli out of here ! I 'll be right behind you . Stand back . [ Prisoners shouting ] - Hey ! - It 's going down ! - It 's going down ! - It 's going down ! Hey ! Come on . [ Grumbles ] Hey . Robbie . Just keep going . S.H.I.E.L.D. will meet you out in the yard . - What about you ? - I got one last thing to take care of . Go . I 'm right behind you ! Go ! [ Music ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Prisoners shouting ] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ No . _ _ _ _ [ Growls ] _ [ Screams ] [ Music ] [ Sirens wailing ] [ Tires squeal ] [ Music ] [ Police radio chatter ] They 'll get you set up , lead you back inside . Where 's Eli Morrow ? I sent him out with Robbie . He should be out here . [ Breathing heavily ] Where 's my uncle ? He 's supposed to be with you . What the hell happened ? ! Move , or I will take your mind apart piece by piece . Burrows : Director Mace , that confession of yours was unbelievable ! You were a hero to people before you had super-strength . But now your approval numbers are through the roof . Thanks , Burrows . Uh , if you don 't mind ... Of course . Huh ? [ Chuckles ] Well , sounds like you were a hit . Oh , this is your victory , too , Agent Simmons . You were a great help . It 's like I always say ... a team that trusts is a team that triumphs . But trust must be earned ... with random , non-invasive testing . Your , uh ... your polygraph this morning generated some alarming results , so I 'd like you to give it another go . [ Music ] About that ... Do you happen to know what a micro-expression is ? The dart of an eye , tensing of forehead ... the littlest thing can say a lot . More specifically , they can say if a person is lying . [ Music ] What are you getting at ? I don 't think you want me to strap back into that machine . He may ask me what I thought of that story you told on television today . You know , the one about becoming a hero in Vienna ? Because if asked , I would have to tell the truth , which we both know you didn 't do . [ Music ] Harlan ... I 'm gonna exempt Agent Simmons from any further testing . Thank you , sir . He 's right , you know . A team that trusts is a team that triumphs . If you 're looking for Robbie , he 's off hating himself somewhere else . Good . I came to see you . - The arm is fine . - I didn 't ask . I know what you 're doing . Trying to distance yourself from everyone else so they don 't drown in your wake ? I invented that move . It doesn 't work ... for one simple reason . Phil Coulson . He found me in that cubicle and dragged me out . He didn 't give up on me ... and he won 't give up on you . - I never wanted that . - Mnh-mnh , no . You don 't get to choose who cares about you . And Coulson ... he 's got a bigger heart than most . [ Somber music plays ] [ Sighs ] Lincoln wouldn 't want you killing yourself over what happened . I promised Coulson I 'd see this operation through . After that , I 'm gone . [ Sighs ] - Daisy ? - Mm-hmm . - What 'd you say to her ? - Nothing she didn 't already know . Well , we 're gonna need her . Fitz found Eli Morrow and Dr. Bauer on the security-cam footage outside the prison . - Hmm . She didn 't kill him . - No . She forced him to leave with her in an ambulance . - What does she want with him ? - I don 't know . But I got a feeling he 's about to find out . [ Suspenseful music plays ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Music ] What do you want me to do ? Read it . - ' Cause I can 't . - Lucy ... We are going to fix me ... and then finish what we started . Don 't see why this couldn 't have been a phone call . Never underestimate the power of human connection . - Or should I say " Inhuman " ? - Hmm . Either way , congratulations on those poll numbers . I have you to thank . You gave me no option but to tell the truth . Speaking of the truth , I went looking for some , and guess what I found ? This is S.H.I.E.L.D. working with a former Agent , now known as Quake , a walking weapon of mass destruction . [ Tablet beeps ] This one was new to me . New to you , too , I see . We 're not sure what the hell he is , but we do know he 's a cold-blooded killer . Santino Noguera ... a model prisoner looking at early release . That is , until he ran into whatever that ... thing is . We know he came in with S.H.I.E.L.D. , and he left with S.H.I.E.L.D. So tell me , are your people aware they 're harboring a murderer , or do they just not care ? [ Music ] In two hours , these will go to ABC News , just in time for this evening 's broadcast . How do you think those poll numbers will hold up ? [ Sighs ] What do you want ?

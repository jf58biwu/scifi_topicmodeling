The Lord of Fire , or maybe Minister Amaso ! Who knows ! Since I was a little girl ... he 's been obsessed with putting his hands in my underwear . And also his friend , instead of helping him ... - She 's totally nuts . We can leave . - Shut up ! Who 's this friend of his ? Who are these people ? Who is this friend of his ? And what the fuck are you doing ? Nothing , I live upstairs , I 'm going out . Then keep going . Are you leaving , or do I need to kick your ass ?

You can transform into a Jeeg ! Did you steal an ATM ? Didn 't you know there are ink bombs inside ? Eh , now I know . You are a superhero , you 're not allowed to steal ! You 're destined to save humanity . I 'm not gonna save anyone . Why me then ? I know why . You can 't take it back , eh ? Because maybe a lot of people will die this time . Oh , I hope so . I hate people . And come on ... It 's not to criticize you , but ... my dear , when you transform , you gotta change your shoes . I 've never seen a superhero with suede shoes . Have you ever seen that ? I haven 't . It hurts , doesn 't it ? - Look , this is gonna heal ... - Would you stop ? Hey , dude , who fucked with you ? - Minister Mimashi ? - Yeah , Minister Sushi . Mimashi ! Look , he 's another man with lots of powers . But he 's not like Minister Amaso who has the Winged Sword . Oh , well ... He 's a poor guy then . No , he 's a psychiatrist at the state mental hospital ! Sometimes he 'd also take us to the pool , Especially Licia , Valentina ... Also me , eh ? Then with his phone he 'd take naked photos of us . What are you looking at ? You know , you 're a handsome guy , Hiro ... Turn around , come on ! Listen , hear me out . If the Day of Darkness arrives , it will be a total mess ! And this is what we 'll do . First , we 'll save my father . Then ... I don 't know where your father is . How many times do I have to tell you ? Still ? The Lord of Fire kidnapped him ! - Who ? - The Lord of Fire . Who is he ? Bye then . Good night . Take it . Eat this because then we 're going to sleep . Why , do I have to sleep here ? - Of course . - Why ? Because if Gypsy finds you alone , you 're screwed . What are you doing ? - That girl looks like Licia . - Turn this shit off . What did I do ? What 's wrong ? This is my house , and you shouldn 't touch anything . Cover yourself , fuck ... Do you have a friend , a relative , somewhere you can go ? I only have you , Hiro ! Where 'd they take you when your father was in jail ? To Capranica . To a group home . Take your stuff then , because you 're going back there . - Are you kicking me out ? - Did you think you 'd found a husband ? But why , Hiro ? Hiro ? Why ? Hiro ... I don 't like it here . I told you , it 's just until tomorrow . My father said that , too , then he came back two months later . Smell how good it smells ? What are you cooking ? - Fish glue . - We 're making papier-m√¢ch√© puppets . Hear that ? They 're making papier-m√¢ch√© puppets . I heard , I 'm not deaf . You can make one , too . What are you saying ? By the way , I still have to finish this . It 's a present for you . - Do you like it ? - A lot . - You don 't even know what it is . - I like it the same . You 're not gonna not save my dad , and instead go out and steal ? Don 't worry . You stay here . Meanwhile I 'll go search for your father , so we can be ready for the Day of ... of ... - Of Darkness . - Of Darkness . And then you 're gonna buy me the princess dress ? Yes , I promise . - I 'll wait for you here then . - Wait for me here . Goodbye then . Bye , Hiro ! - This bastard ! - Unbelievable ! 30,000 views in 2 days . - But are we sure it 's him ? - Yeah , he 's got the same shitty hoody ! And that 's the bank in Aspartini Street . - Fuck , he 's strong . - Say that to Biondo , he got beat hard . Yeah , but I cut half his foot off ! - Check it out . How heavy is an ATM ? - Who knows . The route is confirmed . The deposits from the supermarkets arrive every Friday . If we 're lucky , there could be 200,000 Euros inside the van . Problem is , our insider goes back to work at the end of the month . - We can 't do it earlier ? - No . - Why not ? Tomorrow 's Friday . - Who 's gonna deactivate the alarm ? We need a guy like him . Can you imagine him in our gang ? But who knows who the fuck he is . We 'd need to talk to him . - Dude ! We gotta talk to Nunzia ! - To tell her what ? I don 't wanna make a bad impression with the Neapolitans . We could ask Marcellone to lend us 100,000 Euros . - Sure , borrow money from a loan shark . - Ok , so it 's better to get killed ? Riccardo , come on ! We 've known each other 30 years , and you still don 't trust me ! Can you tell me what the fuck do you want ? I want to make it big . I want people to kneel when they see me , so I can piss on their heads . I want to leave my mark , like this asshole did on YouTube . You 're out of your fucking mind . I 'm just sick of being here , crucified on the wall . √à un vuolo a planare dentro il peggiore motel , di questa carrettera , di questa vita balera . Come on , guys , all together ! E come ricordarlo ora ... Non sono una signora ! Una con tutte stelle nella vita ! Non sono una signora ! - Sergio was found . - With 2 holes in his stomach . - And the load ? - Are you asking us ? You said you already had it . Ant√≤ , somebody ripped us off . - We gotta figure out who . - Technically we don 't give a shit . What the fuck are you laughing at ? I 'm not a clown . Do you want your money ? It hasn 't been 7 days yet . You know how women are , huh ? Nunzia got worried . Then tell her to relax . Does she want her money ? We 'll have it for her tomorrow evening . All right then . Can we count on that ? Yes . Let 's go . ‚ô™ Jeeg Robot theme song ‚ô™ Ok , guys , today 's gonna be different . Our inside guy won 't be in the van , so if you need to shoot , shoot . We 'll close with the Neapolitans tonight , and then we 'll have a nice fish dinner by the sea . Happy , Ricca ' ? Oh my God ! Come on , guys ! It 's coming ! Come on ! Please , stop ! Don 't ! Hey ! Backup ! Backup ! Hey ! You son of a bitch ! What are you doing ? Stop it ! No ! Let 's get out of here !

Come on , come inside . - Thank you . Sorry , eh ? - Goodbye . Hiro , are you moving somewhere ? Don 't tell me you robbed another ATM ! Are you crazy or what ? Bringing cops to my house ! Are you upset I told them that I was your girlfriend ? No , I 'm upset because you 're always around ! - How did you even escape ? - You didn 't come back , so I left . Take it . I finished it . Don 't forget to wear this when you transform ! Wait ... So you won 't forget it ! Listen , girl , you can 't stay here ! Do you understand me or not ? - Come on , I 'm bringing you back . - No ! Actually yes . Don 't you understand that the Day of Darkness is coming ? That my father is a prisoner , and there are lots of people to save ! - Here we go again with these people ... - Yes , people ! People , Hiro ! That 's why you have superpowers . Now take your bag ' cause I 'm bringing you back . Let 's go . You bought the entire collection ! Can we watch it ? Take your bag . Double perforating punch !

Yeah , of the Monster ... Cave Of Fire ! This is the only one I know ... My father used to bring me here , when I was a little girl . With my mother , too . When they were still in love . I liked this place so much . Amaso didn 't have the Winged Sword yet . Hiro , where 's my father ? Where is he ? I don 't know . I don 't know , Ale . Do you want a ride ? It 's shut down . Well , we can turn it back on . It 's wonderful ! Hey , Hiro ! How is it up there ? It 's wonderful ! - Do you like it ? - The clouds are so big ! And you are so tiny ! - Want to go around again ? - Yes ! Here we go . Where are you going , Ricca ' ? I called Nunzia . We 're meeting at 3 . - Who gave you permission ? - She 's waiting for the money since yesterday ! Thank God she 's willing to meet ! - Riccardo , you 're pissing me off . - I 'm meeting Marcellone now . I asked him to give us 100,000 Euro . What am I supposed to do ? Let everyone get killed ? Is it my fault this Superman guy got in the middle of our plans ? No , it 's my fault that I 'm still listening to your bullshit . We 've gotta look for him together to get our money back ! It 's over , Fabio . Now we 're gonna do this my way . I taught you how to steal cars when you were still a baby . Nice way to thank me . We 're gonna fix this mess you made , then it 'll be business as usual again . If you 're good with this , stay . Otherwise leave . Unleash the Rottweilers , Tazzi . What ? ! Unleash the dogs . You already tried on 3 , what 's this dress supposed to look like ? It has to be a princess dress , Hiro . I 'm sorry . - But there aren 't many princesses around here . - There are , there are . Yeah , but maybe they don 't shop at the mall . But how would you know , are they friends of yours ? - I 'm no one 's friend . - Actually , you should be everyone 's friend . You can 't imagine how good your heart feels when you save someone . - You 'd save these random people , too ? - Of course ! - You don 't even know them . - How do you know ? See her over there ? Her name 's Onion . She 's from a noble Samurai family . She 's a widow . She has 6 grandkids and a magic cat that goes everywhere with her ! Wow ... Sounds amazing ... That guy with the beard 's called Kazuki . He 's Turkish . In fact , he speaks " Turkey " ! He 's a nurse , and he 's in love with Midori who works in Old Navy . - He 's in debt from buying her a promise ring . - Really ? Yes , and they sleep on a bed of flowers , just because they 're happy . - Come on , your turn . - Don 't even try . Who 's that over there ? - Him ? - Yeah . Well , his name is Mario . He works at the Post Office . - Wow , what imagination . - What should I say , eh ? Look what I found ! The princess dress ! - You want this one ? Are you sure ? - Yes ! - Will you buy it for me ? - Of course I 'll buy it for you . Hiroshi ! Come on ! Come here ! Beautiful , isn 't it ? So what ? Nothing , I just wanted to show it to you . Do you like it ? Do you like it ? It 's wonderful ! Do you like it ? Yes . Then say it ! What are you , ashamed ? I like it . Do you feel that ? - What ? - My heart . When you 're close to me , it goes bim-bum-bam . Easy ... It hurts like that . Come on , get on . - What 's wrong now ? - Nothing . It 's not nothing , you haven 't said a word . Fuck you . There 's your word . Well , you really are nuts . Really nuts . Don 't you feel ashamed ? - You are a superhero , you have a mission ! - I don 't have a fucking mission . You gotta save my father , the people , humanity ! Your father 's dead , Ale ' ! He is dead . That 's not true . We were doing a job together , but everything went wrong and he got killed . Here 's the truth . - That 's not true . - Yes , it 's true . - What did you do to him ? - Calm ... You bastard ! You sold him instead of saving him ! You don 't deserve to be a superhero ! Now I get why you don 't have friends . You don 't care about anyone , not even me ! Authorities still have no suspect regarding who placed the bomb in Rome last week . Investigators suppose that extremists of the far right could be responsible . There was a meeting to analyze evidence found in the last terrorist attack . ... Figuring out the identity of the super-criminal who robbed a cash van yesterday morning in Rome . With superhuman strength , the masked man easily disarmed the two drivers ... - Never seen anything like that . - How are you both feeling ? What do you think ? He threw me out of the window like a cigarette ! I was scared . Very scared . He destroyed the van just by punching it . The search for the super-criminal continues . That 's all from Rome . Back to the studio , thank you . ... Well , it 's been demonstrated that in some circumstances , even a normal man can develop extraordinary strength ... HAPPY SUNDAY We need the death sentence for the super-criminal ! Tazz√¨ ! Call Marcellone . - What 's going on ? - I don 't know ! Hey , it 's the super-criminal ! Yeah , it 's him ! - I 'm sorry . - Go away . It 's not true that I don 't care about anyone . I care about you . A lot . So that 's why you treat me like shit . I know , you 're right , but I ... I don 't know how to do this . Teach me . I 'm a disaster with women . Go away , I need to go see my father . I 'll take you there . Ok , but next time wear your mask . Everybody is looking at you . Oh my God ! What was that ? A bomb ! Another bomb ! ... 97 , 98 , 99 ... and 100 . Great , Marcellone . You don 't know how much this money will help me . Fabio ... don 't screw me over . Hey , you know me . In 2 weeks , you 'll have your money plus interest . Wanna fuck ? Alright . - Hey ! What ... - Come here . - Who are you trying to fuck with ? - What ? ! You faggot ! Nunzia , wait ! I have the money ! No ! I told you ! I have the money ! I have the money . Nunzia , check the bag ! I have the money ! Hey , what are you doing ? I said I have the money ! Did you see the money ? Nunzia , did you see the money ? ! What the fuck do you want from me ? ! We want respect . Instead , you think you can fuck with us since you were on Big Brother ? That 's not how it works . We are here to give some hope to this desperate country . We help the people that are in hard times . How can we manage this war , if there are people like you who don 't respect us ? It 's not possible . This is war , my friend ! And now ... We light you up . Like a cigarette . This motherfucker is crying ! - You 're crying ! - Hey , we are kidding ! You idiot ! Look who 's here . No ! - What the fuck have you done ? ! - I was good , wasn 't I ? Go fuck yourself , Marcellone . Goodbye , Minister Amaso . Let 's go . A terrible accident , thankfully without victims , happened once again in Rome . This incredible footage shows a man with a black hoodie stopping and lifting a tram with his bare hands . The man , who escaped with a girl , is the so called super-criminal . The one with the superhuman strength , who became famous thanks to YouTube . Everyone thought the video was a fake , but now the police are investigating , to identify the suspect ... - What the fuck ! - They killed everyone , Gypsy ! - We gotta leave . - It is over , Gypsy ... What do you mean " over " ? It 's not over ! Nobody can kill us . We are the greatest motherfuckers ! Yes ? Yeah ! Don 't cry , ok ? Yes ? Yeah . Who cares about the Neapolitans , Tazz√¨ . We are gonna kick everybody 's asses . Let 's go . - Let 's stop by my place . - No , there 's no time . - Why ? - Because there 's no time . - Where are we going to sleep ? - Where no one can find us . Come on , get on . Me and my mother moved here in ' 83 . I grew up together with this neighborhood , basically . Back in the day , almost no one lived here . I remember the streets , with the shining lights . These big buildings with all the lights on . Everything was clean , everything was new . I had friends then . A group of friends to hang out with . But it ended badly . Like all the things you care the most about . You know ... we were already snorting coke at 13 . There was Sabrina , she was so beautiful . She worked at Kursaal , by the beach . She died in a car accident in San Basilio . Then there was Palletta . He was nuts , even more than you . He was shot by the police while robbing a tobacco shop . He was turning 18 that day , he wanted the money to take his girlfriend out to celebrate . Then Michelino , 20 years old . I was told fascists burnt him alive , but I never believed that . When your father was killed I thought my time had come too . That was my destiny . It lasted a second . I got shot ... And when I fell down , nothing . Darkness . It was all over . But instead it wasn 't . I don 't know what happened to me . But I feel good . I feel good because now ... There 's you . Why are you laughing ? It 's just that ... You 're talking to me as if I 'm your girlfriend . But I 'm not your girlfriend . Or am I ? Are you embarrassed ? Who , me ? Come here . - Huh ? - Come here . - Oh God ... - What ? The DVD player . Maybe you left it in the bathroom . Do you want me to get it ? How will you sleep without the music ? I sleep with you ! Who 's this ? Who 's this ? Deez nuts ! Tazz√¨ ! Hiroshi ! Hello . Nice to meet you , I 'm Fabio . Hey . Nobody gave a shit about this tape . Then that movie came out , that one with that blonde girl dressed in yellow with the samurai sword , and then everyone started buying it . People are weird , Enzo . Tazz√¨ ? Leave her alone . She is not involved . She is just a poor , insane girl . She is totally nuts , isn 't she ? If you do what I say , she 'll be fine . Do you want the money ? Take it . What do I care about money ? I don 't give a fuck about that ! - I want a lot more . - I don 't know where the drugs are . I just wanna know one thing . One thing . Who the hell are you ? ! Why are you so strong ? - I don 't know . - You got bit by a spider ? A bat ? Did you come from another planet ? So ... Do you wanna speak , or should we rip her arms off ? I don 't know . You gotta tell me . Because we can have fun together with these powers , Can you imagine ? Two super-motherfuckers like us ! Then everybody will respect us ! The people , television , politicians ! Have you heard the news ? They are giving public building contracts again . The Mafia is already celebrating ! And you know why ? I 'll tell you why : they put the bombs ! And if the State got scared by two little bombs , think if we 'll destroy something special , like Parliament , or the Olympic Stadium during Roma vs Lazio ! We can make a " boom " so big ! The biggest catastrophe of all time ! The biggest tragedy in Italian soccer history ! Then yes , we will be on national television , Enzo ! You are absolutely fucking crazy . I 'm gonna ask you for the last time : where did you get these powers ? For the last time , I don 't know . Dammit ! Dammit , Enzo ! Dammit ! Tazz√¨ , hurt her . No ! Don 't touch her ! Get your hands off her ! Don 't touch her ! Stop ! Leave her ! I 'll tell you everything ! Good ! Stop Tazz√¨ , stop ! Good , Enzo ! Great ! Good . Where did you bring me ? Everything happened down there . What ? Did you take a swim in the Tiber ? ! You said you wanted the truth , here it is . - Now , let the girl go . - Hey , Tazz√¨ , watch out . He is pissed . Don 't worry , Gypsy . What 's down there ? What 's that ? Is there a fucking net ? There are some barrels , I think one broke . - What kind of barrels ? - I told you what I know . Now , enough . I am the only one who can say " enough " ! Come on , dive in . I have to go pee . I said dive in ! What the fuck do you want , I already have powers . Hey , I 'm not gonna dive in that shit . Go get those barrels . The deal was different , tell me where the girl is . The deal , Enzo ? The deal ? You have to do what I say , or I 'm gonna slit that bitch 's throat . - What am I gonna do ? Pee in my pants ? - I can 't let you out . Watch out , I 'm gonna pee in here then . If you want ... I can help you lift your dress . Be my guest . Don 't touch me . I said don 't touch me ! Tazz√¨ ? What 's going on ? Tazzina ! I said dive in ! Tazz√¨ ? Fuck , Tazz√¨ ! Kill them all , Enzo ! Hiroshi ! Don 't let him get the powers ! Alessia ! Go away ! He is the Lord of Fire ! Al√® ... Now I 'm really gonna light you up . Look at me , Al√® . Save them , Hiro . Save them all . Because you can become Jeeg . Al√® , no . Alessia ! Wake up , Al√® . Come on . Good morning . Who the fuck are you ? Cheers . Excuse me , I just need a moment . Action . Here I come ! Ha ! Wait a moment , is that him ? - Him who ? - Him , the super-criminal . Go back , go back . Love , stop with the balloons , please . - You 're right , that 's him . - Come on , honey ! Shit ! Come with us , don 't worry . My daughter ... - Calm . - My daughter ! Let me go ! Let me go ! My daughter is in there ! My daughter is in there ! Gioia ! Please , let me go ! - I 'm stuck . - Don 't worry , I 'll take care of it . Gioia ! Gioia ! Gioia ! Everything 's ok now . This footage is from the massacre that took place in Naples . It surfaced this morning on YouTube . Authorities are investigating the source of this terrible video . It shows a lone attacker killing Nunzia Lo Cosimo , 40 years old , one of the most influential members of the Neapolitan Mafia . Action . Now you will all listen to me . Because everybody must know , also the cobblestones . I 've been ignored all these years , locked up in that shitty doghouse full of fleas and ticks . But now I 'm sick of it . Now the music 's gonna change . Now the time has come for the biggest " boom " you ever imagined . Stay tuned ! - Get down . - Why ? I need it . Don 't worry , I 'll leave it by the Stadium . And who are you ? Hiroshi Shiba . And now , you 're screwed . Hey ... What are you doing ? Why do you wanna jump the fence ? We have great tickets for you . You want them ? Just 10 Euros . I have no money . Go away . You can stick those tickets up your ass now . Fuck off ! Where is the bomb ? You will know when you hear the " boom " . Oowh ! Now we 're gonna play fair , Enzo . Nobody can stop me now , not even you ! Maximum attention please . The suspect is violent and extremely dangerous . I repeat , violent and extremely dangerous . Let 's go guys . Come with me . Hey ! Where the fuck are you running ? Let 's go Roma ! Let 's go Roma . You lost , Gypsy . If you wanna be famous , you should go back on Big Brother . It was Happy Sunday , asshole . Hey ! Did somebody trip you ? Look , from behind it 's a foul . Freeze ! What the fuck are you doing ? Stop ! Exit the vehicle with your hands on your head . - There 's a bomb ! - Do what I said ! There 's a bomb ! Move ! Exit the ambulance or we 'll shoot ! Stop ! Fire ! They jumped off the bridge ! - Did you see that ? - They jumped ! Oh my God , that was terrible ! - He was a great man , that 's it . - He saved mostly the Roma fans . From this we can say Enzo Ceccotti was a Roma fan . He was a thief ! Two years ago he stole my purse ! And you , what do you think about Enzo Ceccotti ? I think that we should dedicate a square to him . He 's right , heroes are like poets : there is one every 100 years . What is a hero ? It 's an individual who is very talented and extraordinarily courageous , who knows how to choose the good from the bad , who sacrifices himself to save others , but more than anything else , it 's someone who acts when he has everything to lose and nothing to gain . Enzo Ceccotti , was he a real superhero , like people love to call him today ? Some people complain that we need superheroes , but the answer is another . The presence of someone who watches out for us revives the hope for a better future . Unfortunately , today , this " someone " is gone . From the Roman suburb Tor Bella Monaca , that 's all for now . Back to the studio . Now to sports ... THE CALLED HIM JEEG ROBOT

 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . The child- - part human , part alien- - Was unlike anything the world had ever seen . My other child is a lifelike android . Mom ? He has become the prototype for a new breed Of thinking machines called humanichs . These two extraordinary new life-forms Now hold the key to earth 's future . But where does that leave us ? Over 99 % of all species That have ever existed have gone extinct . What if it 's our time ? Previously on extant ... What are you proposing ? Coexistence . Coexistence means the end of the human race . Richter : You need to figure out which world you want to live in . You can 't have both . Kelsey richter , daughter of suspected terrorist , Jd richter , was taken into custody today ... What the hell ? You 're not going anywhere . Jd , don 't . Ares , stop it ! He 's free to go . In another life , molly woods . Yeah . Lucy : Whose pyxcube was that ? Charlie : Julie 's . Was that her boyfriend ? Oh , my god , i could go to jail . Only if someone tells . Wait , wait . This just can 't happen . Molly : The gsc has a virus to kill hybrids . A virus i created . Hello , taylor . What 's your recommendation ? Taalr : Release the virus in conjunction With the deployment of the humanich army . You 're not humans . Lucy : General shepherd , We found them . All of them . Reporter : Please stand by for an emergency message From the global security commission . Five counties remain on lockdown As terrorists bearing biological weapons Are still at large . Former astronaut molly ... ( low rumbling ) ( helicopter blades whirring ) ( low , indistinct conversations ) You 're not eating . I 'm not hungry . You wish he hadn 't left . You shouldn 't do that , terra . You can look into my mind if you want . No . I can 't read minds like you can . But you can learn . I don 't want to . People 's thoughts and feelings are meant to be private . I don 't want you to be sad . Well , being sad is a part of being human . Ahdu : Molly . Something 's happened . Heleos is missing . He didn 't come back from his perimeter watch . ( helicopter blades whirring ) Terra . Come . ( excited chattering ) Ahdu : Molly , they 're landing . Down to the tunnels ! We have to evacuate now ! Everybody , stop ! We don 't need to run . We don 't need to fight . We 'll win . They 're inferior . Our powers have proven that . Stop thinking like a human . This is a mistake . Ahdu : Violence is not our choice , But if we have to fight to survive , we will . What 's happening ? They 're immune to us . What about lucy ? Molly : Lucy ? Ethan : My sister . She 's a soldier . Molly : What kind of soldier ? ( quietly ) : They 're not human . Run ! ( distorted shouting ) ( distorted grunting , yelling ) ( distorted ) : Molly ! ¶ ¶ ( distorted shouting ) ( coughing ) Terra ! Terra ! ( distorted explosion , shouting ) ( panting ) Take out the interior . ( indistinct shouting ) ( panicked shouting ) Terra ? ! Sweetheart , we have to go ! ( gunfire continues ) Terra , honey . Come on out , honey . I know you 're scared , But if you don 't come out , i can 't help you , okay ? So come on . You 've got to come out . Sweetheart , come . Oh ... Come out . Come . Okay . Attagirl . Come on , let 's go . Molly . Lucy . Ethan 's mother . Don 't do this . No ! ( gunshot ) ( distorted ) : Run , terra . Run . Don 't worry . This will only hurt for a second . ( gunshot ) You miss me ? What took you so long ? I got here as fast as i could . ( groaning ) ( helicopter blades whirring ) ( molly groans ) Son of a bitch . You 're welcome . Sorry , but that hurt like hell . The good news is we don 't have to cauterize this . What 's the bad news ? The bad news is it 's still gonna hurt like hell , But it 'll stop the bleeding and prevent infection . ( groans ) Sorry . Ahdu : You didn 't have to do that . Her body will take care of itself . Yeah , i 've seen that , And i appreciate the flower-power mentality , But i 'm not taking any chances . What 'd you find out , ahdu ? Casualties . Women , children . Some got away . Some didn 't . Did they find terra ? Or ares . But i know they 're out there somewhere . How do you know that ? I just do . Richter : You know , they had you dead to rights . I don 't get it . Why didn 't they finish the job ? ( coughs ) Oh . The canisters . They released the virus . They did finish the job . ( excited talking ) Julie : Go , go , go , go , go . Come on , everybody out of the way . Move ! Her spinal cortex has been destroyed . Lumbar vertebrae have suffered catastrophic damages . Two , three . Lucy , can you hear me ? I can hear you . All right , vocals have been affected . That means her motor skills will be , too . Okay , don 't worry . We 're gonna get you back on your feet in no time , okay ? Charlie , this is horrible . It 's all right , she 's not in any pain . That 's the beauty of humanichs . What 's done can be undone . I 'm not talking about repairs . I 'm talking about what i 've done ... With john 's vision of the program . That can 't be undone . Ethan : Lucy ! You 're back ! What happened ? Who did this to you ? ! Molly woods . Your mother . They took john 's life 's work And turned them into assassins . ( ahdu coughing ) ( coughing ) Is this what 's going to happen to you ? I don 't know . Everybody is affected differently by the virus . Does that meant that There 's a chance you won 't get sick ? I don 't know . I can 't ... Control what 's gonna happen to me . ( coughing ) right now , All i care about Is taking care of my son . ( grunting ) oh , okay . Come on , come on . Oh , crap . Who is it ? It 's my ex-wife . Here , can you get ahdu in the house ? I ... I can see how this looks bad . Bad ? ! Uh , my ex-husband 's a terrorist ? ! The gsc literally just dragged our daughter Out of my living room . They won 't even let me talk to her . It 's just A scare tactic , all right ? They 're not gonna hurt her . What the hell have you gotten yourself into ? It 's complicated . Okay . Uh , look . How did you even get here anyway ? Where 's you car ? I parked And i walked up the back trail , the old trail . So , no one followed you ? No , no . I followed all your crazy-ass Security protocol . And , yes , i remember what you told me About how to spot a tail . Thank you . Don 't thank me . You 're a wanted man . My just being here makes me an accessory . And i 'm a judge . At the very least , I could lose my seat on the bench . Please . Please , jd , tell me what the hell is going on here . I mean , honey , you 're a lot of things , But a terrorist is not one of them . It 's not me that they 're looking for . Okay ? Ah . So you say it 's very complicated , But actually it 's quite simple . No . You turn them in , And we get our girl back . No , dorothy . Look , If you 're not gonna do it , i will . Dorothy ? Oh , wow . Your heart 's racing . What 's happening to me ? The virus Is ... Affecting your blood . How long do i have ? Well , at the rate your cells reproduce ... A day . Maybe two . Dorothy : Listen ! Whatever 's going on here ... What the hell ? Uh ... Jd : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Dorothy ! Put the gun down , dorothy . Did you not see what just happened ? Okay , i-i can explain ... No , no , no . I don 't i want you To explain anything ; i want you and-and whatever That is to get out of this house . Now ! Listen to me , dorothy . You 're not ... You 're not thinking straight , all right ? Just ... Dorothy ? Molly , what the hell ? Knock it off ! ( laughs ) thanks . That means a lot . ( laughs ) i love you , too . All right . You know what ? That 's enough . Stop it ! I know That it 's hard for you to understand what 's happening . What ... ? What the hell ? Ethan : Can she be fixed ? Julie : We 're trying . Lucy 's in good hands with charlie . No , she doesn 't want a human working on her ! Why not ? Because they can 't be trusted . Why would you say that ? ( sighs ) lucy said that ... She said it was molly who hurt her . Ethan , lucy has suffered Quite a bit of damage . Her diagnostics show misfires All through her cognitive processors . You can 't be sure she 's got all her facts right . Humanichs aren 't supposed to hurt humans , But humans can hurt humanichs . Why is that okay ? It 's not okay . Nobody wants to hurt anybody . So you would never hurt me ? Never . What about lucy ? Not intentionally , no . Good . 'cause if you did , i don 't know what i 'd do . Hey . I brought you a little something to take the edge off , Maybe help you calm down . Calm down ? After what just happened and ... What she did and ... ? And then there 's that ... I mean , I-i don 't even know what he is . What is he ? ! All right , now , come here . ( sighs ) He is ... Half human . A hybrid- - Human-alien . Okay . His name is ahdu . He is molly 's son . And he 's dying . Well , i 'm sorry . I 'm sorry for her and him , Um , but , you know , we have a daughter Who 's being held against her will . I was on my way to help kelsey When the gsc unleashed a reign of holy terror On molly , ahdu and his people . His people ? Whatever you want to call them . There 's more of them ? There were . There were . Most were slaughtered . I saw what was going on , And i couldn 't stand by and let that happen . Not again . This isn 't second kuwait . I mean ... You 're talking about- - i-i can 't even believe I 'm saying this- - you 're talking about aliens ! I mean , i mean , if turning them in gets us kelsey back , Then just do it , jd . I can 't . I-i can 't turn them in . If i do that , they will be killed . ( sighs ) Listen to me . I-i think i have another solution . Okay . It 's cold . I know . If we can lower your body temperature , We just be able to slow down the progression of the virus . And then what ? ( sighs ) It 's all right , molly . No , it 's not all right . I am not giving up , ahdu , okay ? I am gonna figure this out . Now , there 's one person i know That just may be able to help you . Dorothy : Why are you doing this ? Don 't do this ! We both know there 's another way . No , there 's not another way . I 'm going . Going where ? To get kelsey . I 'm gonna turn myself in , molly . Yeah , he 's sacrificing himself for you and your son . I mean , that 's who they really want , right ? She 's right . You can 't do that . They don 't want you . If i turn myself in , The gsc , they 'll release kelsey . All right ? So , dot , You get me a good lawyer . Look , i 'm gonna keep the gsc busy . It 'll buy you time , get them off your scent . I 'm not gonna sit here and watch him die . What choice do you have ? There 's someone at the gsc that i think can help ahdu . Now , i know it 's a hail mary , But i at least have got to try . No . You get within 20 miles of gsc , they 're gonna tag you . Well , that 's a risk i 'm gonna have to take . And what about ahdu ? Well , he needs his cold packs changed Every half hour to keep his body temperature from rising . No ! No , i 'm not going back in there . I don 't know what that alien 's capable of ! That alien ... Is my son and he 's dying . I promise you I will take care of our daughter . Okay . Thank you . Dorothy , don 't do anything stupid . Please . ( sighs ) ( car engine starts ) I ... Feel ... Pain ? ... Fear . Now i get why humans fear death . ( sighs ) I don 't want to die , charlie . Hey . Luckily , you 're not going to . At least , not today . No , not now . Ever . I can 't remove your expiration date , lucy . You mean you won 't . No . I mean , i physically can 't . Removing your expiration date would kill you . It 's a safeguard . Safeguard from what ? John woods believed that nothing was meant to last forever . Not even a soldier . Expiration dates give you more of the human experience . I am not human . I want to live . Whatever the cost . Find a way to remove my expiration date Or i tell julie everything . How you didn 't install my limiters . And how we had ... Relations . Wh ... What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Stop it . Stop that . Stop it ! Stop it ! How the hell did you get video of that ? That was a mistake . Which i stopped . I know that . But julie doesn 't . And neither does the gsc . All of that can change with the blink of my eye . Molly . Look under the table . If this is about what 's happening to you , There 's no way to reverse it . So you know ? We put the pieces together . Okay , Then you know i don 't have a lot of time . Now , shepherd released that virus that we created . A lot of the hybrids have been exposed . Are you ... ? Showing symptoms ? No . The others haven 't been so lucky . I 'm sorry . I don 't need sympathy , I need help . Now , my son ahdu is dying . Do you think plasmapheresis can save him ? It 's a long shot . Okay , but if i could take the infected plasma From his blood ... You 'd need special equipment . And you can get that . You 're asking me to steal gsc equipment , Aid and abet a known fugitive and enemy of the state . You understand that , right ? Yes . And you only helped me Because you had no choice . Because a scary alien hybrid Took control of your mind . So that 's your story ? No . That 's yours . I 'm sorry , But i 'm fresh out of options . ( ahdu 's labored breathing ) ( labored breathing continues ) Could i have some water ? Uh ... Sure . I didn 't mean to frighten you . Earlier . I was just , um ... Caught off guard . It was a logical reaction . Grabbing the gun wasn 't . You 've only held a gun One other time . At a range with jd . How did you ... ? ( sighs ) He taught me how to use one . For protection . He cares deeply for you and kelsey . Did you see that in his mind ? I didn 't have to look into his mind To see the obvious . But you can see in mine ? He 's disappointed you . I know . He fought for us , Helped us when he didn 't have to . He 's a true hero . Mm . Whatever you decide , I understand . ( elevator engine whirring ) You have my daughter And now you have me . Let her go . Charlie : Wait ... Wait , this is illegal . It 's , like , misuse of government property or something . Lucy : Is that all i am ? Property ? Charlie : No . Of course not . You 're ... Lucy : I want to feel what humans feel . Oh , my god , i could go to jail . Lucy : Only if someone tells . What the hell , charlie ? I mean , like , seriously , what the hell ? ! I was drunk , but i didn 't sleep with her , i stopped it . I mean , that part of the footage Is now conveniently missing , but ... ( laughs ) Is that supposed to make me feel better ? Why are you showing this to me ? Lucy wants me to remove her expiration date And if i don 't , she 's gonna send that video to the gsc . She 's blackmailing me . Blackmail ? But ... That 's way beyond the scope of her programming . Actually ... It 's not . I never installed her limiters . What ? Why ? She ... Without them , she was ... Better . Better at what ? Do you realize what you 've done ? Well , you know , if i didn 't find that pyxcube of you and john , We might not even be having this conversation . You know , i always suspected with you guys , But just seeing you like that ... Charlie , I don 't have a pyxcube of me and john . She must have planted it . She knew that would be the easiest way to manipulate me . Now she 's threatening me . What else is she capable of ? Ethan said today that humans aren 't to be trusted . ( exhales ) Give you one guess where he got that from . Lucy 's gone off the rails , jules . We need to Shut her down . For good . ( insects trilling ) What ? Um ... ( ahdu coughing weakly ) Ahdu ? ( raspy breathing ) Molly : Okay . I got something here That might help . Help . Yeah . This machine Is gonna take your infected blood out Clean it , And then put it back in your body . Thank you For staying with him . ( phone ringing ) Hey , baby . Are you all right ? Oh , thank god . It 's kelsey . Yeah . Okay . So you 're home ? Okay . ( whirring ) You got what you wanted : The release of your daughter . Where is molly ? You killed her . She 's dead ? What the hell did you think was gonna happen ? You exposed her to the virus , general , So it 's just a matter of time . You and i , we both know what she is now . So , soon , she 's just gonna be Another little notch on your gun . Right there next to john woods . Careful , richter . John woods was my friend . Yeah , And we all know how you treat your friends . Old tough call toby , no way , he would never order The death of an innocent man . I won 't be patronized by a deserter . A man who would rather Go awol than follow an order . ( chuckles dryly ) You don 't understand honor . Honor ? You want to talk about honor ? You ordered a drone strike That wiped out an entire village Of innocent civilians So you could get one terrorist . And for what ? What 'd you gain ? 400 yards of mud ? A mountain of dead bodies ? If that 's your idea of honor , general ... I want no part of it . What i did won us that war . You won . The rest of us buried our friends . Who are you to sit there and judge my actions ? These people- - these hybrids- - Invaded us . They represent a clear and present danger to mankind . So do you . Your first move Is to destroy what you don 't understand . And you know what ? It isn 't that simple . These ... People ... They are of flesh and blood ... With families . They have compassion , honor ... And the power to destroy us . Killing them is the only option . You seem damn certain of yourself . I have to be . Well ... Certainty is the devil , general . ( whirring quietly ) ( footsteps approaching ) Kelsey 's home . I-i should probably get going . Is it working ? Well ... I have to give it a little more time . ( ahdu groaning faintly ) ( weakly ) : I want to see the stars . ( softly ) : Okay . ( sighs ) People are gonna ask questions . You mean anna . We 're gonna need a decent alibi in shutting lucy down . More money has gone into her than most Fighter jets . You mean " she went totes bonkers " Isn 't a good enough reason ? Julie : Charlie , come on , be serious . Okay . Let 's walk through this . As the face of humanichs , ( over tablet ) : We want to use this opportunity to retrofit lucy With a new alloy , a better alloy . Julie : And we have to take her back to square one to do it . Charlie : Right . I mean , to make her better , faster , stronger , We have to shut her down . Spyder , send this footage to lucy . We have to warn her . Thank you . For what ? For bringing me ... Here . I did this to you , ahdu . I created that virus . You ... Gave me life . You gave us All ... Life . Briefly . It 's not over , molly . They 're still out there . I can ... Feel them . But there are some You cannot trust . ( groans , grunts ) Ares ? And ... Terra . Terra ? ( faint grunting ) ( gasping ) ( exhales ) ¶ ¶ ( softly ) : I 'm so sorry . ( exhales ) ¶ ¶ ( coughing ) ( coughing ) I sent everyone home . There 's no witnesses . Good . Lucy 's in standby mode . Are you sure this is the right thing to do ? It 's the right thing to do . Trust me I can 't trust either of you . I won 't let you kill my sister . Ethan , whatever you overheard , you don 't understand . I do understand . You 're going to hurt lucy . You were supposed to be my bhf . But she was right- - Humans can 't be trusted . Little man , You can trust us- - we 're family . Lucy 's the only Real family i have . You said you wouldn 't hurt a humanich . I wouldn 't . Then why won 't you just fix her ? Ethan , Something went wrong in lucy 's programming , And she 's malfunctioning in a very dangerous way . Charlie : Sometimes things Are just ... Beyond repair . The best thing to do is reboot , start over . We 're not trying to hurt her , we 're trying to help her . I don 't believe you . You 're liars ! Both of you ! Ethan ! I 'm gonna go after him . Just get the job done . ( door closes ) ( door opens ) Ethan ! Hey ! ( panting ) : Look ... You 're upset- - i get it- - but you got to understand , Lucy is not who you think she is . I know who she is- - she 's my sister ! Yes , but she 's also something else . Okay ? Something worse . And it 's ... My fault . ( molly 's labored breathing ) ( machine whirring quietly ) ( weakly ) : You should go . I 'm not gonna leave you alone like this . Jd would want me to stay . Jd ? No word yet . It 's me they want . And we both know it . Ethan : So , You never put limiters on her ? Humans have self-limiters- - Ethics , morals , things you learn along the way . But not all humans are good . And not all humanichs are good . See , lucy , she didn 't have what you had- - A loving family , a lifetime of experience . All she learned was how to manipulate , To get what she wants . Like how ? Well , like , she tricked you into running away , Didn 't she ? Filled your head with all these ideas About how you can 't trust me or julie . Right ? I mean ... She tricked me , too . I know this is hard , Ethan , but ... ( sighs heavily ) There are good humans and there are bad humans , And there are good humanichs And there are bad humanichs . Lucy is one of the bad ones . Lucy : Hello , julie . Doesn 't feel good , does it ? ( gasps ) Not when the decision of whether you live or die is in the hands of someone else . ( gasps , chokes ) Lucy , stop . Please . Stop . My good little soldier Told me what you were planning . I won 't let you kill me . And ethan told me about your legs . He thinks it makes you more like us , but ... You 're nothing like us . ( gasps ) You 're only human . Julie ! Let her go ! ( gasping ) ( gasping ) good-bye , julie . ( panting ) ( trembling breaths ) What did i do ? You saved my life . ¶ ¶ Molly . You wanted me , toby . You got me . ( panting ) Help me . Oh , god , what have i done to you ?

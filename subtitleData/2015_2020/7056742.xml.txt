 Previously on " Salvation " ... We are at war . Us against whomever hacked the IO Space Probe . If we don 't regain control by then , it goes into free fall , and we will lose it forever . Do you think Darius could have hacked NASA ? Darius Tanz , you 're under arrest on suspicion of high treason . You have the wrong man ! Grace ! Find salvation . Darius built the ark to ensure in worst case secenario , that the best of us survives . If he was here when the probe was hacked ... Liam , there 's no way he could have done it . - How do we clear his name ? - We find the real mole ourselves . What are doing in Darius' private quarters ? Shouldn 't I be asking you the same thing ? You know nothing about me . So , Ms. O 'Neal , what headline are you chasing ? And this has nothing to do with Project Atlas ? We 're too late . We lost the probe . That was our best hope of stoping this asteroid . Lazlo . Who the hell was he working for ? Hey , Profesor Croft ? The EM drive , it works . I want this room cleared out in ten minutes , get everything to the warehouse . Nelson will instruct you from there . The EmDrive works . We should be drinking champagne right now , you know , wearing pointy hats . I want to dump Gatorade all over your head . The prototype works . We 'll drink when we actually launch a gravity tractor with a fullsized EmDrive . Darius , if we could just stay put , I mean , we could be halfway through the calculations for the fullscale model by now . Someone here hacked the IO Probe and killed Lazlo to cover their tracks . The EmDrive is no longer safe at Tanz . Neither are you . Lockdown initiating . All employees report to Sandbox for further instructions . You put the place on lockdown ? Yesterday , the FBI said that Lazlo killed himself . The FBI says a lot of things . Doesn 't make them true . Exactly . Which is why we 're not telling the government the EmDrive works . Not until we know who we can trust . I am sorry for your loss . No . Don 't feel sorry for me . Feel sorry for the one who violated my trust , 'cause I 'm going to destroy them . A billion dollars ... gone . Not gone . An investment that could still pay off . Could . Might . Maybe . I am done hearing those words from Darius Tanz . The EmDrive melted down , and he burned through a billion dollars . It 's time to cut the cord . Cut the cord ? Darius is no longer a member of this task force . What ? We 're pulling his funding . The government is done with Tanz Industries . We 've lost control of space . We 're out of options . Darius is our best hope right now . Our best hope ? He squandered a billion dollars . The EmDrive project crashed and burned spectacularly . And now we find out that NASA was hacked by one of his own people . Am I missing something here , Ms. Barrows ? You 've already helped him drain this task force of time and money . There 's only one of those we can get back . You 're saying you want him to return the billion dollars we gave him ? No , I 'm saying you want him to return that money . Get it back , or you 'll be off this task force , too . Grace ? Grace , wait . A little headsup would be nice next time . You let me get sandbagged in there . Grace , this isn 't about you . You 're pulling funding from the one thing that can save us . That 's unfair . You 've never liked him . Well , maybe you like him too much . What 's that supposed to mean ? It means your vision gets a little cloudy when it comes to Darius Tanz . Yeah , you act as if he 's the messiah and we 're all just his disciples , never allowed to question him . There are people he has to answer to , Grace , and I 'm one of them . You can 't kick me off this task force . I 'm the only one keeping the barbarians at the gate . And you 're one of them . Get me proof that the EmDrive has a shot . I can 't sell it in that room anymore without proof . Fine , I 'll get you proof . If you get that pit bull off my back . POTUS wants to know what our next step is . Easy with this , gentlemen . It 's one of a kind . Yes , sir . Easy . Don 't bounce it . Darius , I got to call Jillian . - I need a second . - Don 't shake it . There 's no time . Call her from the road . Ils he the only guy going with us ? I need to keep the circle tight . Can you just tell me she 's safe , please ? I 've hired the best security force in the world . From here on , no one will breathe without me knowing about it . I 'll meet you there . Now go . Okay . Attention , employees , please comply with all security requests . What 's going on ? I 'm sorry , Tanz Industries is closed for visitors today . I 'm not here for a tour . I 'm a personal guest of Darius . Clear to go . Well , you be sure to thank Darius for creating such a warm and inclusive work environment . Attention , employees , please comply with all security requests . Darius , what 's going on down there ? I 'm finding out who hacked the IO Probe , since the government seems to have lost interest . Lazlo hacked the probe . You need to accept that and move on . Darius , everything is at stake here . Yes , I 'm aware , which is why I 've hired some former Mossad to conduct the investigation . Best interrogators in the world . Unlike those amateurs from Langley . The government 's cutting you off . They want their money back , - or what 's left of it . - What ? And they 're throwing me off the task force if I don 't get it . No , not now . Now 's the time when we need it most . The EmDrive works , Grace . What ? We 're in the process of scaling it up now . It 's gonna take massive amounts of material and hundreds of workers around the clock to get this thing built and launched . This little government tantrum could not have come at a worse time . YYou don 't believe me . Said the man who sent me on a wild uranium chase . For which , you still owe me an explanation or , I don 't know , an apology . Maybe a Hallmark card . " Sorry I made you steal uranium for my ark . " Soon as I get my " Sorry I let them waterboard you " card in the mail . Darius , I 'm sorry . I ... I 'm desperately sorry for what happened , and I want to believe you , but right now , I have too many questions and not enough answers . I can 't go back to the Pentagon without proof the EmDrive works . Okay , follow me . You want proof ? You want answers ? Yes , I do . Get in . Who are you ? Hey , Amanda . Thank God . How you feeling ? Sore . Yeah , well , you got hit by a car . How long have I been here ? Couple days . Someone was here , Ed , in the room . This creepy guy in a hoodie . Doctor said you might be just a little confused after the accident 'cause of the concussion . It wasn 't an accident . I think someone tried to kill me . Who ? I don 't know . But I 'm gonna find out . What do you think Darius is doing to the employees ? He 's probably just asking them some questions . Yeah , but , I mean , you saw how crazy he was acting , right ? I just don 't want Jillian to feel like ... The fate of the world is at stake , and you 're worried about your little puppy love ? Okay . Well , first , I 'm not a puppy . And second , what the hell is your problem ? - What 's happening ? - It 's a flat . Nothing to worry about . Sit tight ... Aah ! Hands on your head ! Get out of car , now ! Okay , okay . Phone ! Get in ! Okay . Okay . You guys working for someone ? Is it the government maybe ? Because we have friends at the Pentagon . We can give them a call and clear this whole thing right up . You want money ? One phone call , I can make that happen . Would you shut up ? You 're gonna get us killed . Listen to your friend . 911 , my professor , his place is trashed . He didn 't show up for class . There were big scary goons staking out his house . They chased my ass across town . We 're plotting possible intercept courses with the asteroid to see which countries have available spacecraft out near Samson . Then we 'll approach them about a collaborative mission . But we still don 't know who was behind the hack . How do we know who we can trust ? We don 't . It 's a process . And what do we say ? " Pardon me , but do you mind if we destroy your billiondollar space toy for no apparent reason ? " It 'll look like an accident . By then , it 's too late for anyone to object . Claire , you were a little rough on Grace Barrows this morning . Was I ? Threatening to throw her off the task force ? She 's been working day and night , like the rest of us , trying to find solutions . Well , she 's created more problems than anything else . You know , II get the feeling sometimes that it 's personal . Is it personal for me , Harris , or for you ? Sir . I 've located three probes that can reach Samson . The closest one can intercept in 12 days . Who does it belong to ? China . China 's not gonna work with us . Moving on . Here 's one that can impact Samson in 22 days : The Mahnaz Probe . - Iran . - Try again . Last one is the furthest out . But a collision could be possible in 79 days : The Bijali . India . A U.S. ally . Jackpot . Where are we exactly ? I thought we were going to see the EmDrive . We are . Eventually . Eventually ? Darius , where are we going ? Lazlo 's house . Or safe house , actually . What ? You lied to me again . I never lied to you . How do you say that with a straight face ? I told you that I needed uranium to save the human race . - That 's true . - Okay . Your facility for selfrationalization is alarming . What 's alarming is your selfdelusion . - If I 'm right ... - And you 're certain you are . Lazlo is not the mole ! And it doesn 't matter whether or not the EmDrive works . Nothing we do matters , because someone will always be sabotaging us . What are we doing here ? Laz uploaded something onto a private remote server in the last moments of his life . Yeah . Probably all of Tanz Industries ' secrets . Or the answer to his murder . This is where he lived ? He was a quiet man . With demons . Is this you ? Yes . You 're all set , Ms. Neel . - Thank you . - Thanks . Okay , let 's get you out of here and off of this story . What ? I can 't stop now . This isn 't my phone . Did you put this in my bag ? No . Then I wasn 't hallucinating . There was someone else in my room . Get rid of that phone . Just throw it away now . Amanda , as your boss , I am telling you , you are off of this story or you 're fired , you hear me ? Yeah , I hear you . No story is worth dying for . Yeah . You 're right . Yeah , I know . Come on . Ooh ... Whoa , you okay ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . They said I might have some dizziness over the next few days . Okay , I 'll find you a wheelchair , and we 'll roll you out of here . Okay . Okay . What are we looking at ? The last image Lazlo saw before he died . Who could possibly identify that ? Yes , Darius ? Karissa , I 'm sending you a photo file . Have Tess run it through our facial rec software . See if she can find a match . Right away . Darius . Theresa . My God . It 's been ... 15 years . This is , Grace Barrows , a work , a work colleague . Grace , this is Theresa . Lazlo 's sister . Well , congratulations on all your success . It 's pretty hard not to keep tabs on you . Andand you 're married , two girls ? Yeah , seven and two . Laz probably bored you with photos of them . I haven 't heard from him in a couple days , so I got worried . Is he here ? Maybe we should , we should step outside . Okay . Ambassador Gupta , we 're honored to sit with you today . The pleasure is mine , Deputy Secretary . My country has been eager to collaborate with your space program for some time . Why now ? India is emerging as a major player in space . And , you know , frankly , your landmark missions have come in at far lower costs than ours . I think both of our agencies could benefit from a new level of cooperation . A cooperative effort with NASA could be just the thing to boost our global profile . Perhaps we should engage in an offbooks effort , at the beginning . Just to make certain that ISRO and NASA will mesh well . I don 't understand . I think what Claire is suggesting is that the United States join one of ISRO 's current missions already in progress . Are you looking for something specific ? NASA would like to access the Bijali Probe you currently have out near Jupiter . NASA already has the IO Probe in that region , no ? It 's been ... malfunctioning . It 's not malfunctioning . It was hacked . Wasn 't it ? How did you know that ? Because ours was hacked , too . My deepest condolences , Theresa . It 's Tess . You can call me Tess . Tess . Thank you ... for taking care of Laz for all of these years . I 'm sorry I ... I couldn 't protect him . You did . You saved his life , Darius . And whoever did this ... find them . I promise . That photo of you in front of the tree house ... That was you with Lazlo and Tess ? Yeah . You were in love with her , weren 't you ? Sorry . Incoming call . Karissa . Yes . Darius , facial rec has a match . Sending through now . Whoever infiltrated my game room hacked that probe , Grace . And killed Lazlo before they could be identified . - Darius ... - Damn it . How could I have been so blind ? Croft . The driver ... He 's the one who chased me after your place was trashed . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . It 's burned in my mind . That whole day is . One of these Neanderthals broke my glasses when they were wrestling me out of the van . His place is trashed . He left his glasses behind . Your glasses ... Can 't you get another pair ? No . These are antiques . These were my grandfather 's . They 're one of a kind . Why ? You all right ? - Let me out of the car ! - Stop ! Stop ! Stop . God , it was you ? You 're the mole . Karissa , I can 't raise Liam or Nelson on the phone . Tracking them . Their signals are ... dead . When did they check in at the offsite facility ? They didn 't . - Damn it ! - Where are they ? I don 't know , but Croft has the EmDrive . And Liam . You 're a Russian spy ? No . It 's not like that . I just ... supply technology ... for a price . Don 't be so naive . It happens all the time . How did you figure it out ? Your glasses . Yeah , those oneofakind antiques ? They were in your house when you were supposedly running for your life , and now they 're on your face ! Good observation . So the night you disappeared ... That was just a setup ? No , after you left , I phoned a friend , like I said . But he didn 't work for NASA . This is Malcolm Croft . Yes , II know what time it is , but this can 't wait . A student has discovered something ... An asteroid on a collision course with the Earth . Extinction level . Totally certain . And as far as we knew , you hadn 't told anyone else about the asteroid , so you were the dangling thread . And that 's when things started to get a little more complicated . The Russians tracked me to Darius and into the Pentagon . That 's when they realized that the Pentagon already knew everything , so we had to figure out what their strategy was gonna be . You used me to infiltrate Tanz , and then you hacked the kinetic impactor to protect Russia . Why not have them kill me like they did Lazlo ? Just do it . Kill you ? You are like the son I never had . I want you to come with me . We could finish the EmDrive together . - Where ? - Moscow . They will welcome us like Snowden , we 'll live like kings , and then we 'll launch the gravity tractor , and we will save the world . You have no idea what they 'll do with the technology . You have no idea what they 'll do with us . Liam , think about it . Who is this ? A friend with the same agenda . And what agenda is that ? Atlas . Check the message . - What am I looking at ? - Zoom in . Here 's the billiondollar question : What is Tanz technology doing fused inside this rock ? Who are you ? Resist ? The global hacker collective ? This is so Watergate . Wait , how 'd you get this photo ? I don 't reveal my sources . Hopefully you don 't , either . Why are you giving me this story , not the Post or the Times ? We saw your article on Darius Tanz . A facetoface meeting in the Treehouse . How did you get that kind of access ? Timing ... and skill . Use that skill to find out what the Pentagon and Tanz are up to , and you won 't be a blogger with a secondrate website anymore . You 'll be the future of investigative journalism . And what do you get out of it ? The truth . Okay , Mom , I will . Love you , too . If the U.S. and India were both hacked , what are the chances the others are in the clear ? Well , we can 't very well call up Iran and China for a chat about deepspace probes . Dexter , see if there 's any intelligence about the probes out near the IO . Yes , sir . Sir , the Chinese probe just crashed into Jupiter 's moon Europa . And we picked up chatter about the Iranian probe going offline a few hours ago . It 's not just us or India , it 's all of them . There is a major player out there looking to get control of that asteroid . And the fate of the human race . Harris . We need the use of your satellites now . Black with a little sugar . Thanks . Has this happened before ? A lockdown ? Once . Seven years ago , when some drone technology was stolen . That 's when Darius brought in Lazlo . Who killed himself . The rumor is he was ... stealing from the boss . We work in tech . There 's lots of secrets running around inside these walls . I had this one cousin , he worked at an aeronautics startup in Silicon Valley . He was told day one he 'd given up all rights to privacy . Sorry . I can 't get ahold of Liam , and his work space is empty . He just vanished , and ... he 's not answering his phone . I had this other cousin , he 'd thought he 'd paid his phone bill ... I 'm sure that Liam paid his phone bill , Jamie . Security measures have been completed . All employees must return to their workstations . - Thank you for your patience . - Let 's get back at it . Liam ! I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Really ? You 're gonna shoot me , Croft ? After everything we 've been through , you 're gonna shoot me ? I don 't want to . I don 't want to . But I will if I have to . You killed Lazlo . You wanted to see me ? I thought maybe you could explain what you 're doing here - on this video . - Let me see that . I don 't believe it . All of this is for money ? No , no , no . Respect . I 've watched lesser minds like Darius Tanz make billions off of other people 's ideas , while people like you and I , we toil in obscurity . With the EmDrive , finally , this is my chance to join the ranks ofof Oppenheimer , Einstein , Galileo . And I 'm asking you to come along with me . Liam , I 'm offering you a chance for scientific immortality . Croft , I would rather die a hero than live a traitor . Croft ? Drop it . I already told you , Ms. Neel , Darius is not here . Okay , fine . What about Liam Cole ? Is he here ? He 's not , but I 'll be happy to pass along a message . Thank you , I 'd appreciate that . You 're a friend of Liam 's ? Yeah . I am . Amanda . Jillian . His girlfriend , right ? He talks about you all the time . Have you heard from him today ? 'Cause I 've been trying to reach him . No , I haven 't . Are you okay ? Yeah . I don 't know . It 's been an interesting day . You look like you could use a drink . Actually ... I really could . Come on . First round 's on me . Satellite imaging shows Liam and Professor Croft being transferred to an SUV three hours ago . We tracked the SUV for 30 miles northnorthwest before the satellite moved out of range . You sure you can 't pick them up somewhere ? We hooked into traffic cams , but they left the grid over an hour ago , the trail is cold . Okay , we have the SUV 's license plate number . Let 's put out an APB . We don 't have time for that . Dexter , we have the license plate . Can you get the VIN number from the DMV ? - Sure . - Excuse me , you 're not in charge here . Tanz Electronics built the on board nav entertainment systems for all those SUVs . - In case of emergency ... - You 'd be able to track them . I have the VIN . I just need your security code to get into the Tanz Electronics control system . And there 's a complicated firewall here . Hold on , that 's a rootlevel access terminal . Darius , keep your hands off that keyboard . - You don 't have clearance . - There 's 20 steps here , Harris . The amount of time it would take me to explain it to Dexter ... Isn 't it a little convenient that the EmDrive was lost in the exact moment when you claim it 's finally working ? It wasn 't lost , Ms. Rayburn ! It 's been stolen because it works . Stolen by the same man who hacked the IO Probe . Why should we believe you ? Damn it , because it 's the truth . Lazlo was innocent . Darius has done everything he promised . He invented planetsaving technology in record time , which we are perilously close to losing . Don 't you think it 's time we stopped treating him like the enemy ? Ms. Barrows ... No , she 's right . Have at it . This isn 't exactly legal , but , then again , neither is waterboarding your own citizens , so ... I won 't tell ... if you don 't . Got him . Sir , they 're at a private airfield in Maryland . They can take off without FAA authorization from there . Okay , scramble jets to that location and close the airspace out to international waters . We need to mobilize an antiterror team now . Where are you going ? I have a chopper standing by . You coming or not ? Yes . All right , Liam , this has gone far enough . Leave me alone ! Take everything and go ! There 's only one other person beside myself that can build an EmDrive . Now , what kind of scientist would I be if I left a variable like that on the table ? Now , I 'm giving you one last chance . I don 't want to kill you . But I will if I have to . So , come on . So , you must love it , getting to work for Darius Tanz . And with your boyfriend there , too . Yeah , it 's great ... when he 's there . Meaning ? He disappears . A lot . To where ? Who knows ? It 's like ... vanishes like Houdini . Just everything is so secretive over there . You make it sound so sinister . I don 't mean to . Working there is an honor . I know that . We 're improving the future of humanity . But ... ? Ignore me . I think that I have had one martini too many . Listen , you 're in a new city , new boyfriend . You 're feeling isolated , I get that . And working for Darius Tanz can 't be easy . If you ever need a friend to talk to , I 'm here . You know , you 're the first friend I made since I moved to Washington . Well ... to friendship . To friendship . - You got to stop the plane ! - Drop your weapon ! No , no , no , don 't shoot , don 't shoot ! - Get your hands up ! - My name is Liam Cole ! I work with Darius Tanz ! - Please don 't shoot . - Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! He 's with us ! Are you okay ? It was Croft . That son of a bitch . They took everything . They took the research , they took the prototype . - Everything . - Who ? The Russians . Understood . What ? They can 't find the plane . They must 've disabled the transponder . And they 're flying below radar . Over water in the dark . Russia 's in possession of the EmDrive and all the kinetic impactors . Now what ? I ... When the asteroid gets close enough , we ... use nuclear weapons and ... hope for the best . By then , everyone will know . It 'll be chaos . Anarchy . We need to inform POTUS . To prepare for the worst . Harris ... do you think Atlas is responsible for all this ? Let 's hope not . So , did you get the answers to your questions ? Some . Tess ... was the love of my life . I broke her heart and , as it turns out , my own . She 's my biggest regret , and now Lazlo . I 'm sorry . How could I have been so stupid ? Croft ... He 's the only person I haven 't vetted in all the years I 've let people through these doors . Darius , no one can see everything coming , not even you . He wiped my internal hard drives clean . There 's no evidence we ever worked on the EmDrive at Tanz . If you believed so strongly in the EmDrive , why 'd you make me steal uranium for the ark ? Play the game out till the end . Now that the Russians have the EmDrive , the Americans will challenge them . It will lead to a standoff . That uranium you risked everything for will power the ark 's life support functions , and your selfless bravery will be the only reason any of us live on . You think we 're gonna kill ourselves before the asteroid even gets here . Whoever controls the EmDrive controls the fate of the world , Grace . And right now , it 's in the hands of our enemy . We have no idea what they 'll do with that power . Save us ... or destroy us . Liam ? I didn 't mean to wake you up . Where have you been ? Um ... research . Offcampus . Couldn 't reach you all day . I thought you were dead or something . I 'm not dead . I 'm right here .

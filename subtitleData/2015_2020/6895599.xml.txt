 Previously on " The 100 " ... Based on the new data , I 'd say we have two months of survivability . How many of us will the ship sustain ? Raven : No more than a hundred . We just have to decide who gets to live here . Clarke : Arkadia is just Plan " B. " It doesn 't help the Grounders . I 'm not stopping until we have a solution that saves everyone . Bellamy : If I 'm on that list , you 're on that list . Write it down , or I will . Bellamy , I can 't . Now we put it away and hope we never have to use it . Clarke : Nyko , what happened to them ? Sickness . We didn 't treat her . Abby : Her body 's rejecting the radiation on its own . There 's only one variable that separates Luna from the others . Nightblood . [ Gasps ] Jasper : Ha ! He 's awake ! Hey , Jaha , it looks like you got floated . Clarke : So Jaha says we need police here and here . [ Hooting and applause ] Heh . Keeping yourself busy , Mr. Jordan . Oh , I 'm living it up , every last day . Do I want to know how you managed to do this without waking me up ? Oh , probably not , but the effects are harmless , I promise , kind of . [ Laughter ] All right . We 've had our fun . Let 's get back to work . What 's with the " we 're all gonna die " face ? I mean ... I know what you mean . Bellamy should be back by now . Hunting parties go radio-silent . It 's nothing new . What else ? I just feel useless . I 'm stuck here in case anyone needs a cut bandaged , supervising the backup plan when I should be going to the island to make Nightblood . Clarke , you 're not a geneticist . Neither is my mom . Yeah . Well , they have Raven . Genetic code , computer code . They 'll figure it out . Monty , I 'm serious . So am I. If Jaha 's right and Becca created Nightblood there , they 'll find her records , and all they have to do is reverse-engineer it from Luna . Everyone lives . If they can get it done before the radiation gets here . I guess we better finish the ship . Monty : Riley , how 's it coming ? We 're on schedule here . We should have the radiation patch up before dark . See ? One less thing to worry about . [ Thunder ] [ Thunder ] Black rain . All right . Everyone inside , just like we practiced . Go . Man : Black rain ! Sound the alarm ! This is not a drill ! [ Alarm blaring ] Move , move , move ! Jasper ! Come on ! Jasper , what are you doing ? Can 't live your life in fear . Run ! [ Rain falling ] Monty , you can 't . You can 't . Jasper ! Let me go . No ! [ Gagging ] Harper : Clarke , what do we do ? [ Gagging ] The sky is ... falling . The sky is falling . Whoo ! What is wrong with you ? It 's just rain , not radioactive ash . Dude , not cool . Come on . It 's a joke . Don 't be like that , guys . Guys ! [ Sighs ] When did everyone around here lose their sense of humor ? Kane : Abby , if you 're right , then Luna 's the miracle we need . I wish I were with you . Abby , on radio : Me , too , but you have to be there . Once we create this Nightblood serum , we 're gonna have to distribute it very quickly , and we need peace for that . I have to go . Stay safe , Abby . Be in touch when you find the lab . Abby : I will . You stay safe , too . [ Beep ] [ Sighs ] Have a seat . What did I do now ? Rumors of the Flame 's destruction are spreading . People on the street openly call for the king 's head . Your choices have consequences . Would you rather I killed Indra 's daughter ? I 'd rather you didn 't kill . Our mission is to keep Roan on the throne , to buy time for the others to find a way to save us from the radiation . I 'm doing that . By decapitating an innocent boy . Everyone 's guilty of something . There 's a darkness in you , Octavia . I know you 're still mourning . Sit down . You didn 't have to kill that boy . You didn 't have to kill Ambassador Rafel . You didn 't have to kill Pike . Pike got what he deserved . Justice and vengeance are not the same thing . To me , they are . Your decision-making has grown increasingly questionable , and I can 't have my people going rogue . " Rogue . " I 'm a warrior . No . A warrior knows when not to kill . Lincoln taught you that . You seem to have forgotten . You 're right that we have a job to do here , and right now , you 're making it more difficult . Chancellor Kane , the king would like to see you . You 're no longer part of my security detail . I had Helios saddled for you . The ride home will do you good . I 'm not going anywhere before I talk to Indra . Suit yourself . She 'll be here soon enough . After you . Where are the boats ? Without A.L.I.E. , there 's no reason to be here . According to Thelonious ' map , the lab is in the middle of the island , 5 miles straight ahead . Jackson : You ok for that hike ? Try to keep up with me . Never thought I 'd be here again . Ah , you shouldn 't have come . You 're not fooling anyone , Murphy . You 're still a dick . Miller : Luna , Nyko , time to move . I said , let 's go . Abby : What 's wrong ? A.L.I.E. ' s rules ... no frikdreina past this line . I 've never crossed it . Frikdreina ? Mutants . I never met a line I wouldn 't cross . Abby : All right , everyone . Let 's go . We have a long walk ahead of us . Let 's move . No time . [ Buzzing ] What is that ? Drone ? Emori : We should run . Raven : Why ? What 's the penalty for crossing the line ? [ Gunfire ] - Run ! - Run ! Murphy : I thought you said A.L.I.E. was down . Raven : She is . It 's probably automated . Raven . I can 't keep up . I got you . Cover Luna . Cover Luna ! Move ! Move ! Go . I got her . Go , go , go , go , go . Get down . Emori , are you ok ? [ Drone whirring ] [ Gunfire continues ] Luna , watch it . - Nyko , no ! - You can 't help him . - Nyko . Nyko ! - It 's too late . No . Nyko . - Luna , take cover ! - Nyko . No ! No ! [ Gunshot ] [ Drone clatters ] Well , that took you 10 shots . A.L.I.E. ' s got dozens of drones . Who do you think 's gonna run out of bullets first , huh ? Could we talk about why they 're still in the sky ? [ Panting ] Abby : No . Where the hell 's Luna ? Jackson : They 're back . Miller : We can see that , Jackson . Here 's the deal . If we don 't find Luna , then everybody we know is gonna die in a wave of fire , so we split up . Murphy , Emori , Abby , go west . Wilson , Taggart . You got east . Jackson and I take north , Raven ... - I like the beach . - Stay under the trees . You 're safe here . The rest of you do the same . - We check in every 10 . - [ Whirring ] Raven : It 's still active . One problem at a time , Raven . Let 's move out . I 'll take up the back . We shouldn 't be in this forest , John . We need to cut our losses . Why ? Hey , what are you not telling me ? Emori : Just trust me . There are worst things on this island than drones . We 're safer at your bunker . It 's not stocked . - I told you , I ate everything . - So we restock it . You said it was big enough for two . Abby : Is everything ok ? We need to keep moving . Is there a reason we 're meeting in the embassy ? - I would have thought ... - Tell me the plan . The plan ? It 's been 3 weeks since Clarke told me Praimfaya would once again destroy our world . Skaikru asked for time to find a solution . What do you have to show for it ? We 're still working on it . - Hopefully , with more time ... - Enough . Echo . Stephens , Bellamy , are you all right ? What is this ? Echo saw your people rebuilding your ship . She captured these two hunting in my woods . This one says it 's a shelter from the radiation . It 's a backup plan , nothing more . He said that , too , just before he told us that you have a Nightblood . It 's a good thing the Flame 's been destroyed , or I 'd be worried you 're planning an ascension . You have to trust me . We discovered that Nightblood helps metabolize radiation . We 're investigating ways to create it for everyone , turn everyone into Nightbloods so we can all survive . Blasphemy . Nothing they tell us is true . This is . It 's not blasphemy . It 's ... it 's science . If Nightblood can save lives , we should use it . No ! No ! No . Echo : Warriors don 't reveal their secrets . Kane : No . Roan : Truth is the first causality of war . If your motives were pure , you would 've shared your plan with me . Our alliance is broken . Kane : No . Kane : Listen to me . No ! No ! [ Bellamy grunting ] Kane : No ! No ! No ! [ Beep ] I can 't believe you talked me into this . Come on . You saw Clarke . She needs to chill out . We 're doing her a favor . Fire-suppression foam is almost gone , but there should be enough left in the pipes for one shot . It 's gonna be epic . I need something to pry the keypad open . Uh ... oh . Hmm ? Oh . Nice . I already wrote the program . It should only take a second . Heh , remember the time we welded your dad 's furniture to the ceiling ? That was a prank . Uh , why does Clarke have a list of 100 names ? Let 's go . She 's gonna be back any second . - What is this ? - Just put it away . Monty , talk to me . - Give it to me . - Hey , what ... what 's going on ? I know you know something . The ship will only save 100 people . Guess Clarke made a list . - You didn 't tell me ? - Clarke has a plan . Clarke lied to our faces . She didn 't ... even tell you she was making a list . - Now you 're defending her ? - What do you care ? You 've made it clear you 're planning to die , planning to leave me alone . Which is my choice , not Clarke 's . She put herself on this list , by the way . You still think it 's all good ? I 'm sure she has a reason . Ohh , Clarke 's deciding who 's worth saving . That ... that is just great . Guess what , Monty . You 're not . What ? See for yourself . Clarke thinks you 're expendable . [ Beeping ] Clarke , wait . Really ? I found your list . I guess we know who really matters to you . J ... Jasper ... You 're not God , Clarke . You don 't get to decide who lives or dies . The list is a backup . We have a ... Well , I guess you don 't mind if I tell everyone , then , right ? Jasper , no . - Jasper : People have a right to know - Please . that they 're working for nothing . Is there a fire ? Everything all right ? Not for you . You 're not on the list . What list ? Attention , Arkadia . I have an announcement that could affect everyone ... [ Jasper groaning ] Jasper , you ok ? Jasper . He broke into the Chancellor 's office . Lock him up . I 'm acting on the authority of Chancellor Kane . Take him into custody . [ Jasper moaning ] Get him out of here . Let 's go . - Monty , it ... - Don 't . Just ... don 't . Indra . No . Indra . Indr ... [ Gasps ] [ Man moaning ] Skairipa ... [ Wheezing ] Monty ... Jasper 's fine , in case you cared . I do care . Can we talk in private , please ? It wasn 't easy making that list . I only had so many slots for engineers . You 're an apprentice . Jaha 's more knowledgeable about the ship . He 's more experienced , and Raven i ... That 's what you think this is about ? Clarke , I get why you didn 't put me on the list . I may have even agreed with it . It 's just , who are you ? When did you become this person ? I haven 't become anyone . The Clarke I know wouldn 't be arresting her friends . Kane agreed that we needed to keep this quiet . Kane isn 't here . That 's just an excuse . You 're the one saying , you live and Harper dies . You 're the one shock-batoning Jasper , then arresting him . You 're the one going too far and using the same old justification ... " it 's all for my people . " It is . I know you think people will freak out , but if you just tell everyone the truth , maybe they 'll surprise you . Monty , it 's too risky . Jasper was right . You 're not God . [ Feedback ] Monty , on P.A. : I have an announcement to make . Clarke Griffin has been lying to you . No . Arkadia will only save 100 people . [ People murmuring ] Monty : Who thinks they made the list ? " Abby Griffin , - " Eric Jackson , - Are you hearing this ? " Thelonious Jaha , " Raven Reyes , - " Octavia Blake , - I can 't believe that . " Jim Bruder , - " Heather David , - No way ! " Grazia Watson , " Danny Vertue , " Sarah Soderquist , " Susan Crawford , Shelley Skerritt ... " [ Whirring ] You can 't fly , but you can talk . [ Grunting ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire continues ] Miller , on radio : Raven , report . Are you ok ? All good here . Worry about your damn self . Raven : Luna no ! You 'll get killed ! Luna 's here . She 's heading for the boat . Miller , on radio : Copy that , Raven . Do whatever you can to stop her . We 're on our way . Screw it . [ Grunting ] [ Gunfire ] I can 't let you leave . We need you . I 've heard that before . [ Gunshot ] So I am a prisoner . Your blood can save us , everyone . Do you really think you deserve to be saved ? I know how you feel , ok ? I get it , but it won 't always be like this . You just have to keep fighting . What if the fight is all we are ? We torture , kill , betray . We pretend we 're more than that just to make ourselves feel better , but it 's a lie . What about the child ... Adria ? Was she more than that ? Adria 's gone . They 're all gone . But she was good , wasn 't she ? There are others like her out there . Don 't you want to give them a chance ? You 're not a prisoner , Luna . You have a choice . [ Distant gunfire ] Miller , on radio : Raven , we can 't get to the beach . Taking fire in the north woods . Jackson 's hit . I 'm low on ammo . Put pressure on it . Abby , on radio : What do you mean , Jackson 's hit ? Is he ok ? Miller : I think so . He took one in the arm , and we 're pinned down . Abby : We 're on our way . Miller : Luna 's the priority ! Nothing 's more important than her . [ Gunfire ] We need to help them . Luna , please . I know what to do , but my leg ... Okay ? I can 't do it myself . What do I need to do ? [ Whirring ] Are you sure about this ? I 'm sure . If you can get it , I can hack it . [ Gunfire ] Raven : Run . Luna ! Use the trees ! [ Gunfire continues ] [ Beeping ] Run , Luna ! Go ! Go , go , go ! You 're up . Miller , on radio : Still taking fire . Abby , on radio : We 're almost there . Save your friends . I just need to access its core programming . Raven : The drones are protecting A.L.I.E. ' s facilities like guard dogs . Can you stop them ? Miller : We need you , Abby . - Yeah . There must be a way . - Alright . Abby : We can see you . [ Panting ] [ Gunfire ] I can 't see it . I 'll draw its fire . - What the hell are you doing ? - You 're gonna get yourself killed . When they come for me , shoot them . [ Gunfire continues ] - Hey ! Over here . - Abby ... [ Click click ] [ Whirring ] Murphy : Abby , run ! The drones just fell out of the sky . What happened ? I happened . Now get your asses back to the boat . Luna 's here . Over . [ Beep ] Raven : Luna . It 's not your blood that defines you . It 's your heart . Riley : I didn 't survive the Ice Nation just to die because you think I 'm not good enough . Riley , you 're smart , but you were training to be a guard on the Ark . We only need so many soldiers . You 're telling me that Darcy is more qualified than me ? She 's a trainee , too , and I 'm a hell of a lot better shot , no offense . I know this is hard to take in , but to ensure the survival of the human race , the list had to be weighted towards young women who can have children . Hayes : Wait . What ? It 's because she can have kids ? How 's that fair ? It 's not fair . It 's smart . Monty : Yeah ? What about Harper ? There 's a chance she could be a drain on medical resources . Well , I 'm not sick . Not yet . Your dad . You went into her medical records ? Harper : You 're condemning me for an illness that I might have someday ? Clarke : I had to consider all variables . That 's rich for a person who put herself on the list . And Bellamy Blake ? Come on . Jaha : Of course Clarke and Bellamy should be included . Strong leadership is essential for survival . All right . You don 't like the list . Consider it shredded . Now , we can keep fighting each other and die , or we can work together and give everyone a shot at survival , your choice . Meaning what ? We hold a lottery , randomly choose the 100 people to survive , but you have to work for it every day . You don 't show up for your assignments , you can 't be in the lottery , and when the time comes , we 'll collect the names , and we draw . Good ? Good ? Then it 's settled . Now , that radiation shield is ready . Who 's gonna help me put it in place ? [ People assent ] Let 's get it done . Hey , wait . What are you doing ? Helping . I 'm not trying to undermine you , Clarke . You have to know that a random lottery is risky . We could end up with no doctors , no engineers . You saw that we have to give them something to fight for . We can 't tell people they have no value . That 's not what I said . That 's what they heard . The list was pragmatic , but the people need to feel like they have a say in their fate . I hope you 're right . Heh . [ Helios neighing ] Faster , Helios ! Yah . Yah . Echo : Stop her ! [ Panting ] [ Horse neighs ] It 's over , Octavia . Don 't fight it . Roan wants you alive . Come quietly . That 'll happen . [ Both panting ] Doesn 't have to be this way . It does . You made sure of that . [ Grunting ] [ Grunting continues ] [ Panting ] [ Grunting continues ] I said , I wanted you alive . [ Stab ] [ Gasping ] [ Gasps ] [ Door closes ] [ Beep ] I shouldn 't have locked you up . I thought it was the only choice I had . It was the only choice you gave yourself . If you think you have the best idea , you have to convince people , not lie to them or lock them up . That doesn 't matter now . Monty read the list over the radio . Everyone knows everything . What a shame . I thought you were giving Jaha a run for his money there , Jaha lite . You know , he used to be everything that I hated . Maybe he was keeping us together . [ Chuckles ] When Jaha 's looking reasonable , it 's time to reassess . You can go . [ Sighs ] You know , someday when all this is over , you 're gonna realize that foam bit was funny . [ Sighs ] Miller : We getting close , Dr. Griffin ? It 's just through there . Let 's go . Yep . Luna , I 'm sorry about Nyko . Me , too . Hey , about , uh , what happened at the beach ... thank you . Careful , Reyes . Emori 's already got dibs on me . Uh , small question . A.L.I.E. had a security system to protect this thing , right ? Any idea what she was protecting it from ? Let 's hope we don 't find out . Just in case , Raven , get the drones back into the sky . Voice : Auxiliary power initiated . Not bad , Becca . Doesn 't matter what we do . We 'll always end up here ... in the brink of war . Abby 's on the island . She 'll find a cure . I know she will . Hey ... We will get through this . [ Keys jingle ] [ Lock clicks ] On your feet . What are you doing ? We 're bringing you home . Your ship is shelter from Praimfaya , so I intend to take it . You don 't have to do this . We can find a solution together . That time has passed . Get them ready to march . Bellamy : Octavia will get there first . She 'll warn them you 're coming . You 'll lose . She wouldn 't be taken alive . No . No , no . I am sorry . It was a good death . [ Sobbing ] Oh , my ... no ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! [ Gasping ] Helios . [ Panting ] Home , Helios . Take me home . [ Neighs ]

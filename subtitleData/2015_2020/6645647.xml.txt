 Starting over is never pretty . NARRATOR : Previously on Heroes Reborn ... What is that ? MALE TECH : A tracking device . Jose ! The kind you build when you 're planning to repopulate . Dearing knows where they are . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) I can 't use my powers . FARAH : You will know what to do . Why am I so important ? You 're going to help save the world . LUKE : ( THROUGH SPEAKERS ) Yeah ! Come on , buddy . We built that . We did that . RICHARD : We 're talking total devastation . ( GURGLING ) ( GASPING ) ( COUGHING ) Where 's Hiro Nakamura ? Why does Erica have his sword ? Even if I told you , you wouldn 't believe me . She has him , doesn 't she ? ( GROANS ) ( SPITS ) I 'm only gonna ask you this one more time . ( PANTING ) Where 's my nephew ? Kiss my ass . ( GRUNTS ) ( SPITS ) Then I hope you 're all right with never seeing this again . Where the hell did you get that ? Followed you home from the precinct yesterday . I broke into your place while you were showering . You miserable sack of ... ( GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GURGLING ) Either you take me to your boss , or I leave you at the bottom of this pool . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( HARRIS GASPS ) We 'll see how fast he can duplicate another set of lungs . Dude , trust me . He 's serious . If he kills me , you 'll never find your sister or your boyfriend There 's a place . Yeah . Day 's drive from here . About a year ago , they put out word to local PDs , ten grand a head for anyone with powers . What kind of place ? The kind where they keep Evos . They call it Sunstone Manor . Francis is being moved from Renautas ' Headquarters to one of our southern facilities in less than an hour . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) Phoebe is on her way back from Canada . And Erica ? HARRIS : I can take you to her , but you 'll never make it past security without me . Taylor , wait . No time . I gotta find Francis . With a power like his , I 'm going to need your help restraining him . ( SIGHS ) These are what we use for high value retrievals . Half the size of the original Primatech model , twice the battery life . Good luck .

I knew Hachiro Otomo . He lived with his daughter , but this girl isn 't her . MALE PA ANNOUNCER : Clear the area . All clear . But if she figures out that the sword is the key ... I have my team working around the clock to reprogram Evernow . We 've modded Otomo 's original codes to create a new guard as an added precaution . But she won 't be able to break out the prisoner if she can 't find the prison . ( SIGHS ) MALE PA ANNOUNCER : Clear the area . Creating a cloaking system so she 'll never find it . ( REN SPEAKING JAPANESE THROUGH MICROPHONE ) ( SHOGUN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( JOANNE ON ANSWERING MACHINE ) It 's Joanne - Leave it short and sweet . ( BEEP ) LUKE : Hi , honey , this is your loving husband . You know , the one you nearly shot in the face . I guess there really are things that can 't be fixed through couples therapy . Anyhow , I was just calling to touch base , let you know that I sold the practice , and tell you that I burned down the house . BOAT SALESMAN : Afternoon . Couldn 't help but see you admiring the boats . Bob Berman . Berman Yacht Sales . BOB : Can I interest you in a boat ? I 'll take this . Only bigger . Okay . ( GRUNTS ) ( MIKO SPEAKING JAPANESE THROUGH COMPUTER ) ( REN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( REVERSE WARNING BEEPING ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) ( INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENT ) Take it off him . Are you sure about that ? If he leads us into a trap , I 'm gonna blow his head off . No clones when that happens . All right , just pull it out ? Um ... ( GRUNTS ) ( DEVICE BEEPS ) Ugh ! on ! Ugh . All right , let 's go . ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( BANDIT SPEAKING JAPANESE ) HARRIS : They 're fine . They 're with me . ( BEEP ) ( MACHINE WHIRRING ) ( BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( BANDIT SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( REN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( REN AND MIKO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( REN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( YELLS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( BANDIT GROANING ) ( YELLS ) ( GROANS ) ( MIKO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTING ) Francis ? Francis ? ( SOBBING ) Tommy . What happened ? Did you talk to your mom ? Is it true ? Were you adopted ? ( EMILY SIGHS ) It 's okay if you are . Doesn 't mean you 're not ... Normal ? No . You 're normal . Now you 're making me sound boring . Oh , I 'd take boring any day . We moved around so much , my mom lost all my baby pictures . I mean , seriously , if I could trade my power for a big zit on my forehead , I would do it in a heartbeat . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay , trust me , no matter what you 're going through , there is nothing worse than having zits and braces in middle school . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay ? Now , are you going to tell me what happened or not ? ( SIGHS ) You want to get out of here ? What about your mom ? I just ... I need to get out of here , okay ? Okay . Where to ? ( SCREAMS ) ( YELLS IN FRENCH ) Are you okay ? ( MAN SPEAKING FRENCH ) ( EMILY EXCLAIMS ) ( CLATTERING ) ( WIND WHOOSHING ) ( ELECTRICITY ZAPS ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) This Sunstone Manor ... What do they do to people in there ? Don 't know , don 't care . My 12-year-old nephew 's in there . My life savings is God knows where , so quit your bitching and keep your eye on the prize . ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( THUDS ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) What kind of lowlife sells out his own people for $ 10,000 ? One who likes money . A lot . CARLOS : Or do you just hate yourself so much that you gotta take it out on people like you ? You wouldn 't know the first thing about it , Hero Man . ( CHUCKLES ) Just be glad I didn 't get the chance to take it out on you . Ain 't like anybody else could have gone in after your nephew . What 's that supposed to mean ? Only way into Sunstone is through a checkpoint where they swab for powers . ( DEARING LAUGHS ) Ah , the one guy who actually wants to break into Sunstone is the one guy who can 't . DEARING : Ah . There 's always a way . If you 're crazy enough ... ( ENGINE REVVING ) There is one way . But you ain 't gonna like it . ( ENGINE REVVING ) EMILY : I seriously cannot believe I 'm here . I know , I know . ( CHUCKLES ) You probably think I 'm a walking cliche , right ? I mean , a girl who 's always dreamed of seeing the Eiffel Tower . ( CHUCKLES ) It 's not that . ( CHUCKLES ) You 've got some Nutella on your cheek . ( CHUCKLING ) on , no . Oh , look . Wow . Bonjour . ( BEEP ) They 're scanning for Evos . Come on , you can just ... No , no , we 're going through . They already have me microchipped like a dog . What else do they want from me ? Tommy , you can 't . You went outside the country . It 's going to be fine . ( BEEPING ) ( ALARM BEEPING ) Non . Non . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) I 'm not dangerous . You cannot go up . No Evos allowed . I just want to see the view . Why is that such a crime ? Come on , it 's okay . It 's okay . Come on . No , it 's not okay . Look , man . I could send you , your scanner , and this ridiculously ugly tower into outer space if I wanted to . But I 'm not going to do that , okay ? So please , just let us through . Come on . ( SPEAKS FRENCH ) ( ALL SPEAKING FRENCH ) Emily . ( SIGHS ) What were you thinking ? That was stupid and risky and ... ( SIGHS ) Gosh . I 'm supposed to save the world . I know , it sounds crazy , but this guy who 's been sending me texts , my " Protector " or whatever , when I went to the hospital to see my mom , he was there . He told me that it was my destiny . Like it 's been some big plan or something . Look , all I know is , I 'm not the hero they want me to be . I want to show you something , okay ? Okay . ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) Just a little further . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( YELLING ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( YELLING ) ( MIKO GRUNTING ) NOAH : Harris is getting ... ( GROANS ) ( GROANS ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) Since when do you speak Japanese ? QUENTIN : You mind running all that back in English ? Because I 'm feeling pretty lost over here . My father gave me the mission to find the Master of Time and Space . The Master of Time and Space is a friend of mine , Hiro Nakamura . I came here to free him . That makes us allies . I 'm Noah Bennet , and this is ... Hi , I 'm Quentin Frady . Really nice to meet you . So you 're like a cosplayer , or you do LARPing ? We have to get going before Harris comes back with reinforcements . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) She 's definitely not a LARPer . No . Now , let 's get down to the basement . ( SIGHS ) Oh , my God . ( SHUDDERING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SLOSHING ) ( WIND HOWLING ) ( GASPING ) ( PANTING ) ( YELLING ) ( PANTING ) Huh ? ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) MAN : 643a . NOAH : Whatever Erica 's doing , it 's tied to Hiro Nakamura . If he 's down here , he 's gonna be guarded by something a whole lot worse than what we just faced . I won 't let you down , buddy . Don 't call me buddy . ( GUNSHOT ) Go now ! Warn the others ! ( OVERLAPPING SHOUTING ) Stop the machine ! ( YELLS ) What the hell is this place ? We use it to transport things . Where are you sending them ? You 're interfering with something you know nothing about . ( GUNSHOT ) ( SCREAMS ) The future . To the future ! NOAH : Hiro Nakamura . So you 've harnessed his power the same way you did Molly 's . QUENTIN : Hold up . You guys built a time machine ? Yeah ... ( SHOUTS ) Why ? RICHARD : Erica 's starting over , building a better world for a select few . ( GRUNTING ) Where is Hiro ? Take me to him . I can 't . He 's not here . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . I 'm telling the truth . He 's not here . Not exactly . ( RICHARD BREATHING HEAVILY ) To trap Hiro and manipulate his ability , we had to imprison him somewhere without time or space . Evernow . He 's trapped in the video game . Well , get him out of it . ( GROANS LOUDLY ) I can 't . I can 't . No one can . ( GRUNTS ) We can 't , but Katana Girl can . ( MIKO GRUNTS ) ( GHOSTLY WHISPERS IN JAPANESE ) ( GASPS ) ( LAUGHS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( CHUCKLES ) You think that little girl can get you out of this mess ? Right now , Miko is our only choice . Oh , she 's not even real . The real Miko Otomo died in a car crash . That girl was created by her father , the game designer . She 's an aberration , a virus programed to a quest that will ultimately fail . REN : You 're lying . Miko will be victorious . It is her destiny . Well , then , I guess it 's her destiny to die . The only way to free Hiro Nakamura is for her to sacrifice herself . ( SCOFFS ) ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) ( GRUNTS ) ( MIKO GRUNTS ) ( LAUGHS ) ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) What happened ? To free the Master of Time and Space , I must overcome one final obstacle . What ? What is it ? Myself . ( RICHARD CHUCKLES ) ( ELEVATOR CLANKING ) QUENTIN : Uh-oh , we have company . Phoebe ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) What are you doing ? No , don 't ! Through the doors . They 're bulletproof . ( GROUP GRUNTING ) ( DEVICE CRACKLING ) ( RICOCHETING ) EMILY : We learned about this in French class . They call the Seine the only river in the world that runs between two bookshelves . They 've sold books here since the 16th century . It 's the kind of stuff that starts revolutions . Okay , what 's that got to do with me ? Everything . Bonjour . Bonjour . ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) EMILY : These are what I wanted to show you . There was a time when the world couldn 't get enough superheroes . But then a girl in New York City jumped off a Ferris wheel and regenerated in front of the whole world . And , all of a sudden , this stuff wasn 't make-believe anymore . Who needs fiction when you got freaks like me ? Those powers come with responsibilities . You have to be willing to answer the call . It 's your destiny , Tommy . Kind of looks like you . Do you know what this is ? Is it a rare one ? TOMMY : I 've been hunting this for years . It 's issue number 31 of 9th Wonders ! There are rumors on message boards that the artist was an Evo . ( CHUCKLES ) That the drawings in his books actually came true . See , Tommy ? It 's a sign . It 's your fate . What if I 'm not good enough ? You will be . I know it . I think I 'm ready to go back now . ( ALARM BLARING ) If you 're planning to free Hiro , now would be a very good time . ( MUTTERING ) The sword 's not working ? It 's my sister . Her power dampens abilities . As long as we 're in her shadow , the sword 's not going to put you back in the game . Well , we got to shut her down . I got this . Whoa , whoa . No , no , no , no , no . No one 's slicing and dicing my little sister , okay ? Let me just go try and talk some sense into her . Yeah , you do that , and we 'll try to keep them occupied . Come on . ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) ( REN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) HEY - Hey , Phoebe , please , you don 't have to do this . You can leave with me right now . Okay ? Come on . ( SHOUTS ) ( GROANS ) You need to go , now . ( SPEAKING JAPAN ESE ) You should get to a safe place . Do you know your way out ? Yes . Go , now . ( ALARM BLARING ) What have you done ? Phoebe , listen , okay ? You 're not thinking straight . Erica 's been lying to you . Erica gave me a purpose , a mission , something to live for . Don 't you understand what you 've done ? If that girl frees the time traveler , then we 're all dead . ( GRUNTS ) Phoebe ! ( SOBBING ) There has to be a reason , Quentin . NOAH : Or not . ( GROANS ) Quentin ? Quentin ? ( CHOKES ) Did I do it ? Did I ... Did I save her ? You did good , buddy . You did good . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( DARK MIKO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( YELLS ) ( SHOUTS ) ( COMPUTER PROCESSING ) You really think you 're going to be part of Erica Kravid 's brave new world ? She 's built her entire empire on the exploitation of Evos . She 's gonna betray you in the end . ( GUN FIRES ) ( HIRO GROANS ) Good to see you , old friend . I know what you 're going to ask me to do , Noah , but I cannot . Changing the past is very dangerous ... Erica Kravid imprisoned you . She used you . She slaughtered thousands on June 13th , the day my daughter died . She killed your friends , she killed my friend , and now she wants the world to burn . And she 's gonna succeed , unless you help me stop her . By imprisoning me , Erica Kravid bent time for her own benefit . That is a wrong that must be corrected . I will take you back , Noah , to June 13th . But promise me we will not step on any butterflies . Yes , yes . I promise . Just take me back . Okay . FEMALE TV ANNOUNCER : Welcome to Gateway . The residents are pioneers , doctors , farmers , teachers , engineers ... ( FLUSHMG ) ... who have dedicated their lives to creating a sustainable future for humankind . Renautas , where doing good is good business . Federal authorities shut down the National Mall today after several monuments were vandalized by the Evo-hacktivist group known as Hero Truther . The group also released a new video alleging that over 600 Evos have gone missing under mysterious circumstances since June 13th . In other news ... Hero Truther , if you 're out there , my name is Taylor Kravid . My mother is Erica Kravid , CEO of Renautas . She 's not who she says she is , and her company doesn 't do what it says it does . Those 600 missing Evos , she took them . DEARING : All these missing Evos , here 's where they 've gone . Stop here . ( ENGINE SHUTS OFF ) Gotta switch places with you if I 'm gonna pass you off as a bounty . I 've got a vested interest in your success . You got my money , remember ? ( SIGHS ) Sunstone Manor . It 's just on the other side of those trees . No guards , no fences . There 's something strange about the place . No one ever wants to leave . One problem . I don 't have any powers . Don 't need ' em . You drink this , doesn 't give you powers , but your swab will read a false positive . We go in , find your nephew and the priest , and we get the hell out of here . ( SNIFFS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) All right . ( COUGHING ) ( GRUNTING ) What 's going on ? ( GROANING LOUDLY ) What 's happening to me ? What did you ... ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMING ) Oh , did I leave that part out ? Thanks . Here . Eat . Well , if you 're not gonna eat , you can at least tell me why you tried to kill yourself . I used to believe in something . I had a purpose , a reason for living . But then I lost it . I was just looking for a sign . I 'm looking for something , too . Someone , actually . Seven billion people in the world , and I 'm supposed to find one of them . Crazy , huh ? Where did you get this ? You know him ? ( LAUGHS ) Really ? I mean , I don 't ... I don 't know him exactly , but ... But you know where he is ? He 's in Carbondale , Illinois , last time I saw him . It 's a sign , Luke . That 's why we met , why I had to save you . I have to find him . Why ? Because together , we 're gonna save the world . ( CHUCKLES ) ( LAUGHS ) Then we better get going . ( TOMMY WINCES ) EMILY : Sorry . ( GRUNTS ) Wow . Okay . You know , the whole ice cream thing doesn 't work out , you should definitely think about becoming a surgeon . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) So what are you gonna do with it ? I hear Antarctica 's pretty nice this time of year . ( GASPS ) ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Oh . ( SIGHS ) Look , about today ... Thank you . ( LAUGHS ) What are you talking about ? You 're the one who took me to Paris . You know what I 'm talking about . We haven 't known each other long , but I feel like you 've known me forever , and that feels ... Really good . ( CHUCKLES ) ( SIGHS ) Okay . ( CHUCKLES ) That felt pretty good , too . ( CHUCKLES ) TAYLOR : ( ON SPEAKERS ) My mother 's Erica Kravid , CEO of Renautas . She 's not who she says she is , and her company 's not what it claims to be . Those 600 missing Evos , she took them . I 've been to the top secret facility where Renautas has captured , experimented on , and murdered Evos . ( BEEPING ) Where have you been , Harris ? We have a problem with my daughter . HARRIS : ( ON SPEAKERS ) We 've got an even bigger one - They 've released Hiro Nakamura . ( GRUNTS ) ( CRACKS ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( SIGHS ) It 's good to be back . So you have a plan ? You know I do .

 - Previously on killjoys ... - From the time you receive the box you 'll have one week To assassinate the target . - Khlyen wants you dead , And i want to know why . ( cheering ) - Why did you come to the quad , d 'avin ? - I 'm looking for someone . A doctor . - You have to protect him . He 's family . - So are you . - I 'll take your advice and find work . - Algae farm night watchman . - Another option . - Killjoy . - Dutch should be here . This is important . - Knock it off . - What ? - Your leg . You 're nervous . Stop . - You should be nervous ! ( sighing ) - I just want you to know That if you do pass , i 'm gonna be a cool boss . - One more word , i 'll choke you to sleep . - That 's a little aggressive . ( door buzzing ) - John jaqobis . Sponsoring agent . - Keera deen . Don 't give a shit . Heard all about your tech exam . Set a course record . - I like to be thorough . - We get a lot of ex-military , most of them wash out . They can 't take the independent thought we require from agents . Convince me you 're different . Why do you want to be a killjoy ? - Um ... I believe In what the rack stands for- - - no . Don 't care . Try again . - My team is excellent and i think that- - - strike two . Tell ya what , hero , you get back to me when you figure it out . - I don 't fit in anywhere else . I 'm not cut out to be a civilian and i 'm done being a soldier . I 'm not good at a lot of things . But i 'm good at that . And i would be good for the rack . - Ok . Fist to heart . - D 'avin jaqobis , as of now , You are nobody 's citizen , nobody 's soldier . You renounce all loyalties except these : Our code , your team , and the warrant . How do you swear ? - I will take no sides , take no bribes . The warrant is all . - ( choking up ) : I swore that i wouldn 't cry . - Welcome to the family . Take him to celebrate . You 've been cleared for level four . - Whoa , whoa , wait , wait ... Level four ? - Do i outrank you ? - You can grab your badge at supply just as soon as you pass Your psych eval . - Say that again ? - Come on . Let 's go find dutch . ( crying ) - Hello , darling . ( door closing ) I 'm back with treats . - It 's been days , you must be parched . ( moaning ) - Let 's try this again . Why does khlyen want you dead And how do i find him ? - I don 't know . - Wrong answer . - Please ... - ¶ he keeps chasing me , mama ¶ ¶ he keeps chasing me , mama ¶ - You have two options : Keep your secrets or keep your life . - I don 't know any khlyen ! - Please , don 't do this . Please . I 'm telling you the truth . You know i am . - If you 're not , You 'll wish your death had been this easy . ( slicing ropes ) Now run . Somewhere no one can find you . - ¶ ooh , just wanna feel good ¶ - ¶ ¶ come , come come uninvited ¶ ¶ run , run run ' til i find ya ¶ ¶ don 't care which side that you 're fighting ¶ ¶ gonna get you gone ¶ ¶ - If you 're level three ... How do i outrank you already ? - The rack works in mysterious ways . - Wait , can you even kill people ? - Of course i can kill people ! ... When accompanied by a level four or higher . ( laughing ) Oof , that 's a lotta jakk ! ( spraying ) - Yeah , easier just to burn it , no ? - Sure . If you wanted to knock out half of old town . The stuff 's toxic , not to mention extremely flammable . Hey , so what 's the deal with this psych eval i gotta get ? Any tips ? - I dunno . Don 't be crazy ? - ( man ) : Go back to the farm , jakkholes ! ( people shouting ) - you know how pree gives us All those free drinks ? - Yeah ... - Nothing 's free on this moon . Come on . ( loud rock music playing ) ( grunting ) - This little arrangement that we have is becoming Less charming . - My best hokk . Should dull the pain . You wanna tag in ? ( grunting ) - Nah , he 's good . He 's level four . You really need to close shop during harvest week . - Oh , please . Migrants all come back from leith Loaded with joy , and if they 're buying , you know i 'm pouring . - ( woman ) : Hey ! ( groaning ) - Hi . - So the best part about being As drunk as i am right now- - - is that you won 't remember Any of this in the morning ? - Oh ... I 'm gonna want to remember this . - Excuse me . Is that the guy that threw you ? - Yep , he owes me a new drink . - Hey , buddy . ( choking ) - Ok , i think he learned his lesson ! - D 'avin ! D 'av ! That 's enough ! ( gunshot ) ( crowd yelping ) - I have a headache , a badge , And a gun . Behave . - Hey , where have you been ? - Hey . - Ok ... Sexers are offering 20 per cent off upstairs . Harvest special ! - You 're bleeding . - I 'm celebrating . Level four . Watch out , i 'm catching up . - You pass your psych eval yet ? - Go see pawter . She runs a clinic out of a room upstairs . See if she 'll rubber stamp you . - She 's your doctor ? Seriously ? - We can 't take you on missions until you clear your psych . - It 's just ... D 'avin 's like a comet , you know ? - Mm , right , comet . Mm-hmm ... - Me , i 'm uh ... I 'm more like dark matter . ( unbuttoning ) I 'm stable . I hold things together . - John , if you just wanna talk- - - I know , you charge the same amount - that 's cool . So where was i ... - If you want to talk , There 's something i 'd like to discuss too . It 's vincent . My husband . - So what 's going on ? - He spends half the year on leith . He goes to plant hokk and comes back before harvest . But this year he hasn 't . - So maybe he decided to stay on and earn some extra joy . - I haven 't heard from him . Nobody has . - So he just disappeared ? - His visa expires in two days . If vincent 's not back by then , the penalty Is ten years of hard labour . I co-signed the work visa . If they can 't find him ... - ... His sentence is automatically transferred To you . Oh , n 'oa ... - You have to find him . I put out a warrant on him and i want you to take it . - You know i love you , johnny , but nope . No way . - Oh , come on , it 's a legitimate warrant And a favour for a friend . It 's a win-win ! - Unless you fail-fail . Also , stop being friends with everyone you sleep with , it 's just weird . - Hey , if the thought of poor sweet n 'oa dying a slow death In the yttrium mines doesn 't bother you ... ( coughing exaggeratedly ) - oh , please . - The company makes examples of illegal exiles . You know it . - Where is the target ? - On leith , during harvest fest ! So we grab vincent , make some joy , blow it all On pumpkin beer and grackle , all while we soak up the sun . Did i mention that we 're gonna be going undercover ? You love undercover ! ( chuckling ) ( wincing ) - Ouch . What 's with the burn ? - Nothing . Stupid accident . Why are you so keen on this warrant ? - Just ... I want us both to get away and have some fun . You know , before d 'avin joins the team . And besides , You have seemed a little tense lately . - What the hell ! I wouldn 't mind being someone else for a while . But i get to choose our covers . - That never goes well for me . ( loud electronic music playing ) - ( d 'avin ) : So you sobered up fast . - Ancient doctor 's secret . We have all the best pills . ( buzzing ) So , you kind of lost it out there . Do you always fight with such intensity ? Intensity ? - When i get angry enough . I didn 't get this from the fight , though . I got it acing the killjoy test . - If you 're the pass , i 'd hate to see the fail . - Oh my eyes are fine . - Even killjoys get concussions . - I 'm fine . Besides , i 'm not a full killjoy , yet . I still need to pass my psych eval , And was hoping you could sign it for me . - Oh ... You need a rack-certified doctor And i 'm the only one Around for miles . Ok . What 's in it for me ? - Well i could ... Buy you dinner ? - ( laughing ) : Wow . That sounded totally sincere , Thank you . How about this : Your partners Are heading to leith . Get me a seat on lucy when they do . - Why do you need my help ? - Because dutch doesn 't like me and she 'll say no if i ask . Get me a ride , help me pick up supplies at the bazaar And i will sign that psych eval for you when we 're back . Deal ? - I 'll talk to john , make it happen . - Good . Do you want some , uh , pain meds For your head ? - Actually , you got any , um , copazenol ? It helps me sleep . - I 'm all out . - ( man ) : Alright , new pickers , welcome to the farm . Behave yourselves , work hard ... - ( second man ) : Right there . ... You 'll leave here with a year 's worth of joy . - Move it up . Next ! - What is that ? - It 's insurance , so you 're not tempted to overstay your visa . ( whirring and clunking ) - Move . Next ! - You work sun up to sun down . No excuses . - So johnny got himself in as a migrant worker , should be settled On martell 's farm by now . - " should be " ? - Farm rules . Data blackout for all migrants , So he deactivated his com . - Well , i looked into This martell fella 's shop , looks clean . - No workers awol for 6 seasons , but a whole lot Of " farm accidents " and " work-related deaths " . - Enh , probably self-inflicted . I 'd kill myself if i had to farm all day . - The cover you wanted . Won 't stand up to much poking around , But this warrant ain 't worth my extra effort . You sure it 's worth yours ? - Seems to mean a lot to johnny . - Why ? - Ever since his brother Showed up , john 's been off his game . He needs a win . So , john 's looking low and i 'll be looking high As a hokk distributor working for the nine . - My lady . Bedros martell . It 's an honour to have you as a guest At my humble hokkery . - Not too humble , i hope , or i 'm wasting my time . We only import the best . - I 've prepared my finest room for you . If there 's anything I can do to make your stay more pleasurable- - - Fetch my luggage . That would be a good start . - You ok ? - This moon 's just too damn hot . - Take it easy . - Hey , westy . Fresh off the transport , huh ? - How 'd you know ? - They don 't pay us to " take it easy " . - Yeah , well , i had a drinking buddy in old town that told me This was the farm to crew if i ever wanted an easy job and fresh air . You know vincent sh 'ao ? ' cause i could really kick his ass right about now . - They don 't pay us to talk , either . ( groaning ) - hey ! Get up Or we 'll dock a day 's wages ! - He needs water . Easy , easy , easy . - Got ourselves a runner ! Activate the tracker ! ( bang ) ( choking yell ) - ( john ) : What the hells ? - New people , pay attention ! That is the kind of accident that happens When you break your work permit . Stay in the zone . Now get back to work ! - What about " under cover " didn 't you understand ? - Calm down , i was careful . Wow ! Nice . You definitely got the better gig . - Oh , gross ! Please get off my bed . - They make us sleep on hokk leaves . Who does that ? - John , you smell like lucy 's septic system and that is 3000 count qreshi delta linen , So get off my bed . ( sighing ) Tell me what you 've found . - Not vincent , But i did discover martell 's Innovative worker retention program . They jam one of these puppies into us . - What 's that ? - Ow ! It 's an incendiary tracking device . They remove it on the transport home , but until then , step out Of the designated zone and ... ( making explosion noise ) - That 's great news . - That i have a tracking bomb in my ear ? Thanks . - That vince has . Can you get into Whatever system martell tracks his migrants with ? - Why do you think i 'm here ? - To ruin my bed And steal my bonbons ? - You know you 're just Role-playing a qreshi bitch , dutch ; you don 't have to be one . ( beeping ) - Can 't get access . It 's eye scan only . - Then i 'll get us an eye . Not literally . Meet me tonight . - I need a minimum 50 doses , But i 'll take more if you 're feeling generous . - Sorry , i can 't help you . I 'm just an herbalist . - Come on . We both know you sell more than just herbs . - You want linaria root ? I can sell you that . - Please . I 'm losing 10 children a month To pleuroxis . I need your help . - Ask me , the best thing for the quad Is fewer westerlyns . - Come on . We 'll get it somewhere else . - Ahh ! - You heard of selius fever ? It 's nasty stuff . - Pawter ! - You want the inoculation ? Let 's trade . - Nice try . Get the doctor what she wants . Slowly . Not a word . Do it . - Here , this 'll cleanse your palate . - Where did you get that ? - The big house . - You went inside ? - Yeah , why should they get all the fancy stuff ? ( laughing ) - I haven 't had real cocoa since i was a child . Thank you . - So , what brings you to leith ? - Like i said : Sun , fresh air , joy . The usual . - You 're not exactly the usual . - I 'm not ? - No . You 're either really brave or really dumb . - Well i don 't want to live in a world where i have to choose . - Seriously , why leave ? - I came to the quad on a stolen ship With nothing in my pockets . The only place that would take me was westerley , But i hate living there And i definitely don 't wanna die there . - You 're thinking of running ? - Not after what i saw today . - Good . Running never works . - Is that what happened to vince ? He tried to run And now he 's fertilizing the hokk ? - Well if you know vincent , You 'd know he 's smarter than that . - Does your family have much land left ? - On qresh ? By the time my father was of age , most of it had submerged . He was the youngest , so he got a one-way trip to leith and a parcel of land . - Which now produces some of the finest hokk in the quad . My investors are very interested in importing If they like what i see . - Our hokk recipe is my invention , and i 've dealt with My share of swindlers and spies along the way - Many thinking themselves quite clever . - But there 's one thing Cleverness can 't get you - Taste . Mm . We 'll start with a young shiro . - Peppery , with hints of citrus . And if i 'm not mistaken ... Vanilla . But this shiro 's been aged at least two years . - Two years , three months . Your palate is refined , seyah . - As is my generous host . I 'd never know you for a leithian . - Shall we try a vintage gorudo ? - And waste a perfectly good bottle ? You 're touching me . - Trust me . We 'll have more fun drinking this . - Permission to touch you , my lady ? - Granted . - Permission to take your clothes off ? That 's quite the burn . - That ? It 's nothing . - And what about these bruises ? Are they " nothing " ? What highborn qreshi woman has these scars ? - Feel that ? That 's from being tied with bansa knots . And this , this is from a long night And an even longer whip . We of the nine like to play rough . - How rough ? ( grunting ) - How much can you take , you dirty leithian ? - More . - I 've always wanted to make a high-born woman scream . - Have you ever experienced a qreshi two-hander ? - Show me . - Close your eyes . Sweet dreams . - Welcome back , Bedros martell . - Track me vincent sh 'ao . Tether it to my guest 's personal device . ( beeping ) - got you . ( groaning ) Log out . Shut down . ( beeping ) - You became overstimulated . It happens the first time . - Uh , wait , did we finish ? - Thank you For a very enjoyable evening . - Was i good ? ( sighing ) - Relax ! She can 't report us . Do you have any idea what the penalty is for selling black-market meds ? - And do you have any idea what the penalty is for armed robbery And assault with a deadly pathogen ? - That was water ! You think i 'm crazy ? - A little , yeah . - I 've been told that By saner men than you , d 'avin jaqobis . - You knew you were gonna rob her . You used me . - Oh right , like you haven 't been playing me ? " i can buy you dinner . Oh , look at my manly muscles . Please sign my psych form . " - Alright , alright . Guilty . - Look , i really did need those meds , ok ? Pleuroxis was barely a cold when i grew up on qresh . On westerley it 's a death sentence because no one can afford the damn pills . Not ok . - So what took you to westerley ? - Need . As soon as people Heard there 's a doctor around they started lining up and they haven 't stopped since . Westerlyns get a raw deal in the quad . I try and balance it when i can . Your turn . Why are you here ? ( fireworks whistling ) - Midnight celebration . Harvest tradition . ( people cheering ) ( fireworks crackling ) - Yeah , we should head back to lucy . - No , watch . ( fireworks mingling with explosions ) - D 'avin . It 's ok . - Alright , vincent . Come out , come out , wherever you are . ( device beeping ) Oh , damn . - Well this just got ... Creepy . What do you think ? Workers chopping and running Or serial killer with an ear fetish ? - Either way , why hasn 't martell reported them missing ? ( people chatting ) - Whatever it is , all breadcrumbs lead to that forest Outside the security zone . - Agreed . I 'll call d 'avin in for back up , go with him at first light . - D 'avin ? Seriously ? I 'm literally standing right here . - Your head will literally go boom if you leave the grounds . D 'avin 's standing by at the leith market . - Fine . But i got in tight with this migrant worker , shyla ; i think She knows what 's going on , so just give me a day to work That angle , get some intel- - - no . - I 'm sorry , are you not letting me ? - Again , john : Bomb in your head . I don 't want you painting an unnecessary target on yourself . D 'avin and i will handle it And that 's final . - Whatever you say , Boss . - Johnny , Don 't be a shit . - D 'avin jaqobis . Fearless , decisive , Has what it takes to be a killjoy . He 's also hyper-violent . Has trouble sleeping . Occasionally cannot to distinguish between Civilian life and battle . My diagnosis : Stress response syndrome . - You triggered me on purpose ? - I 'm sorry . I was doing my job . The signs were there , i just needed to be sure . - Wanna know what i 've observed ? Illenore pawter simms . Messiah complex . Fraud . You 're on westerley the same reason As the rest of us : 'cause you have nowhere to go . - Nice . But you can 't drive me away that easy . - The company threatened to suspend your medical license unless you left qresh . Banishment ? Damn , doc ! What 'd you do ? - Where 'd you hear that ? - Killjoys have access to all kinds of fun files . Just doing my job . - Like you said , you 're not a killjoy - not until i sign off on you . I 'll find my own ride home . - Hey , " brave and dumb " , Still enjoying the fresh air ? - Actually , i just came to say goodbye . - What ? - Harvesting hokk isn 't for me . We 're not slaves . I can quit if i want , As long as i go straight back to westerley . - Yeah , and they can make sure you don 't see A single joy and that you pay for the transport Back out of your own pocket Or lock you up for the debt . Is that what you want ? - Ok , truth . I didn 't come here to pick hokk . Now , vince said there was more to this place . If he lied , Then i 'm gone . But if not , i want in . - Why are you telling me ? - Because i know that you 're involved . Now , whatever it is , I 'm ready for it . - One-way ride . You do this , there 's no coming back . ( humming ) So just how brave and dumb are you ? ( exhaling ) - Incoming call from dutch . - Go ahead , dutch . - Has john been in touch ? - [ no . Why ? ] - I wanted to apologize about something this morning , Couldn 't find him . And none of the other workers have seen him . ( device beeping ) i 'm tracking his ear tag . - What 's he done now ? - Oh , no ! Oh , johnny jaqobis , tell me you didn 't ! - So i came to leith , prepared to work myself Into an early grave . Then i met vincent , And he showed me a new way . - So you go back and forth Between the farm and the forest ? - To find other westerlyns who refuse to be defined By the world they were born on or assigned to . People who have what it takes . - To do what ? Do what ? - Follow me . - Crazy , ear-chopping son of a bitch ! Lucy , ready engines . - Engines ready . - Dutch , i 'm coming in hot [ and leveling the forest until we find him . ] - Easy , soldier . Stay ready , but leave it with me . ( doors opening and footsteps approaching ) - You might want to put those down . - And you might want to tell me who the hell you really are . - Most hokk distributors i know Don 't pack this kind of weapon . Who are you with ? - Killjoy . On an official warrant . - Well , i guess the migrant worker that broke in here And attacked you was too stupid to know any better . Pity about the blood on my nice rugs . Do it . - ( man ) : Hey ! ( grunting ) - I don 't have time for this . ( groaning ) - Ow ! ( cracking ) - How about your rug , your blood ? ( groaning ) - What do you want ? - I wanted a holiday . I have a lot i 'm dealing with right now , so unless you want me to vent my frustration By frying the crap outta you , tell me : Where 's my partner ? - Everyone , meet john , Our new friend . - You brought me to a jakk grow-op ? - Where 's john ? - I have no idea what the hell you 're talking about . ( buzzing ) ( groaning ) - Did that help ? He went looking for vincent sh 'ao . - Vincent 's not here . He 's out in the woods . - Doing what ? - Running a jakk grow-op . - Where 's the grow-op ? - I can tell you , but you don 't want to go there . - And why 's that ? - When you hacked my system I thought you were here to bust me , so i contacted The authorities and expressed my absolute shock At finding a jakk grow-op running under my nose . - Plausible deniability , nice . How long do i have ? - Before the defoliation ships arrive ? In an hour that forest will be a dead zone . And if he 's out there , your partner will be , too . - That him ? - Yeah , he says he knows you . - Oh really ? - Look , i can explain.N explain . ( grunting ) - Look , i 'm just here to bring you home . - I am home . Here 's the danger in telling lies : Someone always knows the truth . So unless you want a bullet to the head , " old drinking buddy " , you 're gonna tell me who you are . - I 'm a killjoy . I 've got a warrant to take you back to westerley Before your visa expires . That is all . - Who put out the warrant ? - N 'oa . His wife . You remember her ? - I didn 't know she cared so much . - She kinda has to . She co-signed your work-contract . If you go awol , She does your time - and i 'm not gonna let that happen . - Yeah well , i 'm not going back to westerley . N 'oa should have made better choices . Now i gotta get rid of you . - You really don 't want to do that . The rack will hunt you down . - The rack ? By the time they find your body , i 'll be long gone . - You brought him in , You put him down . Let 's go . - Get up . Up ! - Get here , d 'avin . Get here now . - [ hang in . Almost there . ] - I 'm sorry , john . I really am . - You really should be . ( choking cough ) - Don 't move . I 'm going after vincent . - In range for landing . - Good . Locate dutch 's position and bring us down As close as you can . ( high-pitched beeping ) - I don 't know all your beeps yet , lucy , what does that mean ? - Congested airfield . There are other ships heading To our destination . - Oh , that 's not good . - John ! - Hey , dutch . So where 's d 'avin ? - What the hell happened here ? - John jaqobis happened . - Ok , you 're amazing . We need to go , now . ( echoing boom ) - What 's that sound ? - Defoliation ships . - Martell ratted out the operation to the authorities . - Ok , i 'm ready . You can take me home . - No ! We stay and fight . We 'll shoot at their ships , drive them off . Buy enough time to save the crop . - If you stay , you die . Come with us . - Back to old town ? Prison ? Go to hell . I fight for what 's mine . - You got a warrant for me , not her . Take me . - He 's right , john . If she wants to stay , that 's her choice . - Have it your way . - Keep up vincent ! - [ those ships are dropping payload , you got about 10 seconds . Hustle ! ] 10 , 9 ... ( high-pitched beeping ) - ( john ) : D 'av , we can count ! Vince , haul your ass ! - Toxin dispersal ship approaching . - Get in . Come on . Come on . ( groaning ) ( ship whirring ) - Congratulations , i 'm back on westerley . Your warrant 's complete . You , uh , wanna get rid of these things ? - Thank you so much For the ride . - John , Your guest has arrived . - Much appreciated . - Vincent ? - N 'oa , baby ! That was so close . - I missed you ! Did you miss me ? - Are you kidding me ? I thought about you every night ! I owe you my life . - I hope you think about me every night for the next 10 years , You pathetic , wannabe , planet-hopping ass ! - I like her . - He 's all yours , johnny . - Baby , wait ... - Vincent sh 'ao , It gives me - well , let 's be honest - Great pleasure to inform you that you are so locked And incredibly served . - This is horseshit . Your warrant was to bring me back here , and i 'm here ! - Unfortunately , your off-world permit expired An hour outside of westerlyn airspace . Johnny , did we take the scenic route ? - We did , and i feel terrible about that . The company 's charged you with illegal emigration , Issued a new warrant even before we landed , jakkhole . So have fun serving your time at the bottom of a mine . You should have made better choices . - You ask me , it looks a little large ... - I 'd shut up before she takes off your other ear . - It 's gonna be a while before i can fit you in , So if i were you i would go get really , really , Really drunk . - This is gonna hurt , isn 't it ? - I 'll come find you when i 'm ready . ( device beeping ) - I know i 'm supposed to say something to make things better . - Say you 're sorry . You could start with that . - I 'm sorry . And for the record , i don 't care Why you left qresh . It 's none of my business . - Do you like living this way ? - No . - Then do something about it . D 'avin , you don 't add up . You 're taking copazenol , you say to help you sleep , But copazenol is a very strong neurological medication . Who prescribed it to you ? - Some army doc . - What was she treating you for ? - Honestly , can 't remember . - Read it . - You 're passing me ? - Because we had a deal and i keep my word . Look , if you care at all about yourself Or your team , you need to get help . Stress response syndrome doesn 't just go away , it takes Treatment , and- - - ok . - Ok ? - Yeah . What about you ? Can you treat me ? - Why ? - I don 't like most doctors . I like you . - What 's in it for me ? - Pumpkin beers . Pree saved us a couple . - Disobeying orders , Cutting off your ear ... What 's going on with you , jaqobis ? - You first . Strange red box , Mystery burns , asking d 'avin to join our team Without asking me first ? - He 's your brother , i thought you 'd be happy . - Of course i 'm happy ! - So then what 's the problem ? - It 's complicated . For once I had something that i was amazing at , i had a partner That i loved working with . And then he just comes in , He starts d 'avin-ing all over it . They started him at a level four . I 'm allowed to be conflicted for a day . - His level four is nothing Compared to the six years we 've had each other 's backs . If you 're worried about being replaced , Don 't be . You 're Irreplaceable to me . ( chuckling ) - Thank you . I like when you use your words . - Look , if you ever want him gone , he 's gone . You can 't make your brother-crap our crap . - I know . You have to deal with that . - I will . - Soon . Because ... He 'll probably just leave again , Once he finds that doctor he 's tracking . ( sighing ) - Now you gonna tell me what 's been going on with you ? - If i tell you it 's over , Can we let that be enough ? - Ok . But no more secrets . - No more secrets . Tap my heart . - Good . ( exhaling ) now ... If you 'll excuse me , I have to go see a girl about an ear . ( theme music playing ) Sed captiononing by settete inc .

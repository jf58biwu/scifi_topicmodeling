 [ narrator ] previously on dark matter . [ five ] i 've got all your memories in my head , i know it . [ one ] i 'm jace corso . [ corso ] no , i 'm jace corso . [ three ] i promise i will not rest Until i 've done everything i can to save you . [ wendy ] i 'm programed with various Recreational subroutines , do you like fun ? [ three ] ugh . Wait ! This runs counter to your programming . Fun remember ? [ reporter ] the search continues for emperor ishida 's murderer Purported to be his own son , crown prince ishida ryo . We just ... Murdered ten thousand innocent civilians . ¶ suspenseful music ¶ [ steam venting ] whoosh , whoosh [ six ] you draves ? Maybe . I 'm lookin ' for someone . Yeah ? Who ? He 's the leader of the procyon insurrection . They call him the general . [ draves chuckling ] What 's so funny ? He 's the most wanted man in the galaxy . What makes you think i know where he is ? Well , he 's been using arrakis sadr as his base , And since this is the closest station to that planet , It 's a good bet his supply line runs through here . And to keep below the radar , he has to be doing business With the local criminal element . You 're it , no offense . And i hope you 're not offended If i tell you you 're insane . Do you know how many people he 's killed ? I 've got an interesting business proposition for him . You put me in touch with him and i 'll make it worth your whi ; Ten thousand bars transferred directly into your account . I can do better . Twelve thousand . You misunderstood me . I said i can do better . [ six chuckles ] whoa . What 's going on here ? [ callie ] griffin jones . Wanted for smuggling , piracy , murder . It 's quite the rap sheet . And a hell of a bounty to go with it . [ fighting noises ] oof , ugh , urg [ rapid gunshots ] bang , bang , bang [ gunshells clatter to ground ] [ six grunting ] [ slap ] [ draves grunts ] What part of " we need him alive " didn 't you understand ? [ draves panting ] sorry , boss . [ body disintegrates ] [ one screams in pain ] Aaaah . What are you doing ? [ one groans in pain ] I was surprising you with a hug . Why ? [ one panting ] i don 't know , i thought you 'd enjoy it ? Do i look like someone who enjoys surprise hugs ? In retrospect no , not at all . Let 's keep it professional , ok ? [ annoyed ] okay . How 's she doing ? The corrector nanites in her body are damn impressive . I 'd say she 's about 85 percent healed . So , close enough . We gonna bring her online ? Not yet . She 'll be good to go by day 's end . But we 're 20 minutes out from the space station . We gonna shuttle in ? No , we 'll dock . Well how 're we gonna dock without the android ? I 'll take us in . Just giving everyone a heads up . We 're about to dock . If you 're looking for a seat belt , you 're out of luck . Of course not . I was just- - adjusting my seat . [ keyboard keys clacking ] Here we go ... [ computer powers up docking rou ] [ the raza humming to descent ] swoosh , swoosh , swoosh [ four grunting ] [ nunchaku chain clinking [ computer powers down docking r ] And we 're docked . Never doubted you . Uh-huh . [ two ] okay , supply run . One , you 're on infirmary restock . You got your list ? Got it . Four , seeds to keep hydroponics going . Five , you 've got gak ... Connectors , adapters , and 3-12 sprockets . That 's what i said . Three , you 've got juice . Make sure that um- - Where the hell 's three ? [ five ] in his room . He says he 's not coming . I 'll get him . Give him some time . He 's had enough time . [ knocking ] Get lost . [ door slides open ] What 's the point of knocking If you 're just going to come in anyway ? It 's polite . Are you coming ? Nah , i got stuff to do . Such as ? Cleaning my guns . Working out . Cleaning my guns . Alright well we haven 't been off this ship in a few days . Who knows when we 'll get another chance . Well , you have a good time . You need to move on . I 'm thinking " moving on " is what i 've been doing all my lif . Maybe it 's time i stopped , and considered the consequences . Consequences imply that you were responsible . She was relying on me ... And i failed her . She believed in you with good reason . You did everything you could . [ four sighs ] We all owe you our lives . [ two ] okay , same drill as last time . We 're docked under a false registration . Just remember don 't draw any unnecessary attention to yourse . And , yes , i speak from experien . Think he 'll come ? In the interest of us getting some actual rr , I hope not . Oh , come on . You 're all thinking the same thing , I 'm just the only one with the guts to say it . [ three ] alright ! There he is ! Bring it on . Let 's do this boys ! Huh ? Okay , what 's up first ? Shops , spa , food- - [ five ] food ! [ three ] spa ! Seriously , kidding , food . Alright lets get some grub . [ six ] eh , you guys go ahead . I 'll catch up with you . Are you sure ? Yeah . Alright , knock yourself out . [ five ] what ? Aren 't you going to get something to eat ? No , i 'd rather hang with you . No . What i mean is , i just need some time to myself okay . But we 'll hang out later . Okay ... [ one ] garlic ? It 's not garlic ... Parsley ? [ two ] yes . [ four ] onions , mushrooms- - No , no , no mushrooms . It 's nuts ? What 's that flavor ? Nuts ! Mealworms . [ three ] when you say mealworms , Is that one of those words that sounds like something , But means something completely different ? Like " firearms " or " anal-geesic " ? It 's pronounced " annal-jezik , " And mealworms are worms- - well larvae . They 're protein-rich and a hell of a lot less expensive And easier to source than beef . Meh . [ one ] excuse me , c-could i see menu please ? So you 're not gonna eat that ? Cheers . [ callie ] griffin jones . Wanted for smuggling , piracy , murder . I had one of my boys run a face recog When you started asking around about me . Curious that way . Hands behind your back . [ fighting noises ] oof , ugh , urg [ rapid gunshots ] bang , bang , bang [ gunshells clatter to ground ] [ draves panting ] [ alarm dinging ] ding , ding , ding [ woman ] how do you feel ? Fine . Why don 't i remember what happened ? If your clone returned to its transfer pod , All new memories should 've been sent back And uploaded into your temporal lobe . Well , they weren 't . It seems your trip was terminated early . No bio-mass recycling was recorded . Your clone died . Does it say how ? Just that we lost vital signs at 21 : 34 hours Which triggered your early wake up . Could 've been an accident ... Or natural causes . What do you mean , natural causes ? Genetic conditions can be transferred to the clone ... No , it wasn 't that . Put me back in . Our policy states that transfer travellers Have to wait 30 minutes between travels . I don 't have that kind of time . It 's a precautionary measure To guard against stress-induced complications . Come on . Sorry . Regulations . Just- - look , i get it . You 're a cog in a big machine . Keep your head down , put in your time , Retire and hopefully you die before the savings run out . It 's a solid plan , but i 've gotta ask : Doesn 't it ever get to you ? I mean haven 't you ever wanted to just- - Once- - stand up for yourself ? Stick it to the big faceless corporation ? Break one of their stupid rules ? By letting you transfer 30 minutes early ? Uh , for example . It 's your cerebral cortex . Thank you . [ glasses clinking ] Do you know when i decided i liked you ? When i didn 't shoot shoot you When you tried to steal the ship ? No . When you abandoned us on that mining planet . Yeah ? Yeah , at first , i thought you 'd screwed us over , right ? And i thought , " damn . I like this girl . " But then , when you came back and you saved our asses , I was like : " damn . I really like this girl . " [ two giggles ] Yeah , you guys , i mean . You guys are great man . I may not say it enough but- - Or at all . Ever . But you guys- - [ one ] hey ! [ three ] hey you ! What 's wrong with you guys ? You 're leaving me hanging , fiver . What do you mean ? We 'll you 're all ... Getting along . It 's weird . Are you drunk ? Of course we 're drunk . Have a seat . Here , have some- - eat . No . And drink something . What 's the matter ? It 's six . He 's gone off the station . What ? [ one ] what ! [ two ] what do you mean , he 's not on the station ? [ four ] where 'd he go ? [ three ] bastard stole our ship ! [ one ] hey , hey , hey ! [ five ] no , the ship 's still her . [ three ] what ? And so is he , kind of . Hang on a second . What are you drunk ? Is he here , or is he not here ? He 's using transfer transit . What 's transfer transit ? It 's state-of-the-art travel te . [ five ] you get into a " transfer " and input a destination . The pod sequences your dna and maps your brain . Then , that information gets sent via subspace ... Anywhere across the galaxy where there 's a receiver pod ... [ five ] where they create a clone of you , Complete with your memories and personality . It 's like flesh and blood 3d-printing . [ six laughs ] wow . [ five ] but the clone has a short life span- - A few days , maybe . It has to return to its transfer pod before that time So all the new memories and experiences Can be sent back to you before you wake up . How the hell do you know all this ? I read the brochure . Hang on . Just go back . What the hell 's transfer transit ? No , stop . Six would never submit to a dna scan . Not after what happened last time . It says all dna profiles are kept strictly confidential . Yeah they would have to be , Otherwise they 'd lose a lot of business fast . Still , it 's risky . He must 've wanted to go somewhere pretty badly . Wherever he 's going , whatever he 's doing , It can 't be good for us . [ woman ] you 're back . I am . What 'll it be this time ? Merchandise or more information ? Information . I came in here earlier . Yeah ... And i needed help finding someone . And i gave you a name and sent you on your way . That name again ? What ? What was the name you gave me earlier ? Draves . Wanna write it down this time ? Nah , i 'm good , thanks . Sure . See you around . Not if i get it right this time . [ walkie talkie clicks on ] [ draves ] yeah ? [ woman ] yeah , it 's me . He 's on his way down . [ walkie talkie clicks off ] Are you sure we should be going through his stuff ? Pretty sure . Yeah . It 's not right , it 's an invasion of his privacy . [ three ] you didn 't have a problem invading my privacy When you stole my bullets . [ five ] that was different . I thought you were dangerous . Look , i didn 't want to get him in trouble , I just thought it was weird That he was keeping something from us . That maybe he needed our help . [ three ] i knew it ! He 's been hoarding the green not-as-crap-tastic protein bars ! He said we were out ! I got stuck eating the blue ones . They taste fishy ! [ keyboard keys clacking ] [ computer beeps ] [ four ] hmmm . What 've you got ? [ keyboard keys clacking ] [ computer beeps ] Great . [ keyboard keys clacking ] Try " six . " [ keyboard keys clacking ] [ computer beeps ] [ four ] uh-uh . Try " lying hoarder " ? We can waste all day guessing . We have to find a way to bypass the password . No way . Look at it this way : You 'll be proving his innocence . [ five sighs ] [ keyboard keys clacking ] [ computer processing ] [ keyboard keys clacking ] He was researching a terrorist attack on some space station . A lot of people were killed . [ reporter ] breaking news . We have an update on the bombing of station hyadum 12 By the anti-corporate terrorist group Calling itself the procyon insurrection . Over ten thousand lives were lost in the attack , And today investigators released the following video . [ reporter ] security footage uploaded to the g.A. Hub Before the station 's destruction clearly shows One of the suspects believed to be responsible for the bombing . If you see this man , do not attempt to apprehend him , But call your nearest g.A. Detachment immediately . And you thought i was dangerous ? It was instinct . I 'm sorry . Well your instincts are terrible . And nearly cost us a huge pay day . I 'll be careful this time . I promise . Nice and simple , right ? We tell him we 're taking him to the general- - Then we capture him , alive , torture him , And then we get him to give up his real location . What if he gets suspicious ? There 's no reason for him to be . His first clone took its memories with it . As far as he knows , we 're meeting for the first tim . You draves ? Maybe . So what can i do for you ? [ fighting noises ] oof , ugh , arg [ gun shots ] bang , bang , bang [ draves ] no , wait- - ! Whoa , whoa , take it easy . I had nothing to do with this , i 'm just the girlfriend . Like hell you are . You 're way out of his league . Besides , your nails don 't quite match your outfit . They 're nice and short , ideal for handling a gun . Last time i was here i missed something . Not sure what it was , But this time i 'm not gonna take any chances . And that means shooting you before you can draw . Now , i need some information and a shuttle . [ five ] i don 't believe it . He couldn 't have killed all those people . [ four ] why , because he 's nice to you ? You think that means anything ? [ three ] it does seem a little hardcore . Even for one of us . It 's a mistake . It has to be . [ one ] what about calchek ? He knows our histories , maybe we should call him . No , it 's too risky . [ two ] if we start asking for information we should already k , He could get suspicious . And i-if he finds out about our memory loss , He could consider us damaged goods and end our arrangement . Or worse , make a move against us . [ one ] other ideas ? [ four ] we follow six and find out for ourselves . [ sarcastic ] that 's a damn good idea ! We just go hang out by his pod , wait for him to wake up , Make him cough up some answers . [ four ] i mean we use the transfer technology , And see what he 's up to . [ three ] there 's no way i 'm getting sealed up In one of those things , all gift-wrapped And helpless for the g.A , no fricken way . I 'll do it . He did it for me . With the android out of commission , We need you here , you 're our resident tech expert . I 'll go . You go with him . Hang on . He , uncharacteristically , makes a good point . You 're pretty damn vulnerable lying trapped , In one of those things . [ two ] six respects you . If there 's any confrontation , You 'll be able to reason with him . You have to go . [ woman ] for the duration of your travel , Your body will remain here in cryo-sleep . When your clone returns for bio-mass recycling at the end o , Its experiences and memories will be uploaded , Transferred back , and reintegrated with your own . Is it safe ? Absolutely . It 's the safest way to travel . With your true body here , you 're never in any real danger . Your clone could travel into the center of a star , And you 'd be perfectly fine . The possibility of any critical complications Is extremely remote . What do you mean by critical complications ? It 's barely worth mentioning . There have been a handful of incidents- - Strokes , heart attacks , the occasional aneurysm , But a causal link back to the technology Has never been established . Well , that doesn 't sound so- - Sold . Excellent , let 's see when we 've got a slot available ... How about next- - How about right now . Right now ? Okay , let 's get you signed up . Are you a couple ? [ one ] uh , no- - [ four ] is there a discount ? Ten percent . [ four ] well then yes , we are a couple . Also , a good friend of ours was in earlier today . Griffin jones . We 'd like to meet up with him . Did he tell you where he was going ? Uh , no . He doesn 't know we 're meeting up with him . It 's a surprise . Yeah , it 's his birthday . Uh-huh . Well i can 't divulge information about other customers . It 's against company policy . Also , it 's definitely not his birthday . That 's one of the things You have to provide when you sign up . Let me ask you something . Haven 't you ever been tempted To just break the rules , and finally- - Get back at my big faceless corporate bosses For making me feel so small and insignificant ? Uh ... Send red team to pick up the shipment . Sir , i 've detected an incoming shuttle . Headed our way . First squad , with me . Update us if you hear anything . Yes , sir . Okay , i 've entered your destination coordinates And you 're all set . Just lie back and relax . Hang on , what if there 's some kind of m-medical issue ? The system automatically monitos for signs of physical distress . At the first indication , you 'll be pulled right out . Okay . Good . Good . Wait ! W-what if t-there 's a fire ? In all station-related emergencies , My first priority is to awaken I travellers and get them to safe . Ready . Hang on , what if- - Wait , wait , hang on , hey , wait- - Wait , hey , excuse me , excuse me , hello ? [ gun cocking ] [ man ] that 's far enough . You 've got some balls coming here . I 'm unarmed . I 'm here to see the general . Just so happens he 's waiting for you . You ready ? [ one ] yeah . Let 's go find six . What the hell man ? ! Who are you ? Where is he ? ! What are you talking about- - Oh , crap . [ one sighs ] Who are you ? It 's me , it 's one . You 're four . The rest of the crew is back on the raza . We just used the transfer tech to follow six To this space station to find out what he 's up to . Three is an asshole . It is you . Yeah . A glitch in the transfer process ? [ four ] can 't be , this body was constructed On your dna template , so- - This is my real body . This is what i look like . Really look like . I 'm sorry . [ five gasps ] You 're awake ! My systems is 93 percent restored , But my corrector nanites are more efficient While i 'm in sleep mode . Well , welcome back . Thank you . Why are you sorry ? You got hurt because of me . I possess no pain receptors . I mean you were damaged by that other android Because i suggested that you apologize to her . I apologized because you presented A reasoned argument to do so . I had no choice but to respond accordingly . Of course you had a choice . In fact , no . I 'm a logic-based entity , Therefore , i act and react in a purely logical manner . No , no you don 't . I 've seen you angry , sad , lonely , happy . You might not have pain receptors , But your feelings can get hurt . I 've seen it happen . You were jealous of wendy . I was not jealous . Think of the impression that she made on you , When you saw her with us . Now that i think of it , i did experience a sensation That could be misconstrued as human resentment . No . That was jealousy . And you know what that means . My programming is flawed . No , you have feelings . Congratulations . Hopefully this draves fellow shows up . Look , i 'm sorry . I should 've just come clean sooner . True . I don 't know why i was posing as jace corso . I don 't remember . So whatever hidden agenda i might have had , It 's gone now , right ? I know you can 't speak for anyone else , So i just want to know where i stand with you . We cool ? At the moment , i think i 'm the least of your worries . You wanted to talk to me ? We 're looking for someone . Seems a lot of people are doing that today . Big guy , came through about an hour ago . Last we heard , he was headed in your direction . Yeah , i know where your friend is . He 's no friend of ours . Then what 's your business with him ? Payback . Well , why didn 't you just say so ? Hey griff . Good to see you again . So , what brings you back after all this time ? Unfinished business . Huh . Thought you were just tired of running . It must get really exhausting , Always having to look over your shoulder ... Never too sure who you can trus . I imagine it 's hard making new friends When you have a reputation for killing the old ones . They weren 't my friends . They were your brothers in arms and they trusted you . And i trusted you when i flew that shuttle Onto the station to take that g.A. Cruiser . You manipulated me , made me complicit in mass murder . You were a soldier . My soldier . And we were at war and that station , That was a legitimate target . Over ten thousand lives were lost , including children . Hundreds die every day under corporate rule , and the galacti - Our protectors , they stand by and let it happen . There 's no such thing as a bloodless revolution . You know you were a good soldier , griff . Determined . Relentless . The very qualities that now make you a threat . You 'll be dead before your friends arrive . Oh ! Apparently they 're on their way . And my men , they are more than ready to welcome them . You keep checking the time . You waiting for something ? Son-of-a-bitch . Well , griff , timing ? Not really your strong suit ... [ explosion ] [ shots fired ] bang , bang What the hell was that ? I figured this was a one-way trip , So i set my shuttle to go critical . Though it did take a bit longer than i thought . Timing not being my strong suit , right ? [ groan ] [ both men grunting and gasping ] [ six panting ] Are you kidding me . What have you done ? He was a clone . I know . So am i . So shoot , don 't shoot . It 's not gonna make much of a difference in the long run . [ gun shots ] How 'd you find me ? We asked around . Who 's your friend ? Long story . [ two ] you lied to us . I didn 't so much lie as ... Slightly delay telling the truth . Oh , really ? And when exactly were you planning to tell us that truth ? Honestly ? I don 't know . I was looking for the right opportunity but ... When 's a good time to tell your friends You 're not who they thought you were ? Hell , you 're not who you thought you were . All i know is i assumed an identity To get onboard this ship . As to why , i have no idea . Right after that incident with the real jace corso , You should have told us everything . Hiding the truth makes us vulnerable . If corso had come back at us , We never would have seen him coming . I know . I didn 't think it through . Is there anything else you 'd like to tell us ? Now 's the time . [ two ] and you ! You knew , and kept it a secret . That 's just as bad . It 's not as bad . It was strictly for blackmail purposes . We don 't keep secrets , And we don 't blackmail each other either . Fine . [ two ] and you . What reason do you have for putting us all at risk ? It was something i had to do alone . I didn 't want any of you talking me out of it . Or screwing it up . That 's an apology ? No . It 's me being honest . That 's what you want , isn 't it ? What i want is for us to be able to trust each other . Moving forward , no more lies , no more secrets . We have to have faith in each other if we 're going to survive . But despite everything that we 've been through , We just can 't seem to do it . Whoever wiped our memories , Probably did it to make it harder for us to work together . Guess what ? It worked . [ two ] it all looks good . Are you sure ? No discernible abnormalities ? None that i can see . Why ? Are you worried about something ? You 're implying i experience anxiety . What are you suggesting ? Nothing . Wow . Touchy . Suggestive of hypersensitivity . All the diagnostics show normal . You 're fine . Which is more than i can say for the rest of the crew . What 's wrong with the rest of the crew ? The atmosphere on this ship is bad . The atmosphere is optimal . It 's 78.084 % nitrogen , 20.9476 % oxygen , 0.- - Morale . I mean morale is bad . Yes , that is suboptimal . We have to find a way to trust each other . I mean , if we can 't even do that , How can we possibly hope to survive ? How indeed . You look like you want to say something . If you honestly feel this way , why don 't you tell them ? Tell them what ? The truth . About yourself . [ five ] hey ! Hey . How was your workout ? It was good . Hey . We 've got another 3 hours or so before they finish repairs on tp And some of us were thinking of heading into the station to cat . Do you wanna come ? No thanks . But it 's star wars 36 . Remastered in full vr , they say it 's a classic . Naw , i 'm good . Have fun though . But you said we would hang out later ... [ door slides shut ] This is the ishida directorate . How may i help you ? You know who i am . I wish to speak with hiro . One moment . Ryo ? Hello , brother .

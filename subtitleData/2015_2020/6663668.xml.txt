 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... And not everyone who can change should change . You sound like one of those hate groups ... the Watchdogs . " Kill the aliens and take back the planet . " Help me , please . You got to let me out , Jemma . I 'm the only one who can protect you . Where are Hunter and Bobbi ? They 're not coming back . They 've been disavowed . It was all we could do to keep them from being executed . They did that for S.H.I.E.L.D. They did that for us , and they paid the price . Believe me , guys ... I 'm gonna miss them , too . ¶ ¶ On ESPN . Will it be anything like the thriller we saw last year at Clemson ? Sure that 's the right move , Alfie ? You know what 's not the right move ? Calling me Alfie . Mom gets to . You don 't . If you 're gonna ride this thing like a damn maniac , I wouldn 't have to come home and repair it for you . You wish you rode like me . Yeah , you got nothing to ride without that intake valve I brought you . I could always take it back . Okay . Well , your Ironhead 's in great shape , and you 're never home to ride it anyway . Maybe I ought to ... Never ride my bike ever ? Yeah , I love that idea . I mean , I thought you were gonna finally ride it when we drove to Baja . Baja . This again . Look , I told you , I got buried in work . All right , I 'm sorry , but , we 'll find a time . I understand . Being an insurance-company drone is super interesting . Why not bury yourself in that work ? Funny . I was wishing I was back at work right now . Seems like a pretty sweet gig if it gets you a hook-up on an impossible-to-find intake valve . Yeah , honestly ... job hasn 't been great lately . Management 's out of control , new people keep coming in every day ... no experience . And the two friends I was closest to , they just got ... transferred ... for good . Work buddies ... come and go . Now , family ... they 're the ones you can 't get rid of . Even if they set up a roadside stand and tried selling you off to strangers . You were an awkward kid . I 'm sorry about your work . I 'm sorry about your layoff . But it 's just a temporary setback . ¶ ¶ Why is this still here ? When Mom and Dad left you the house , they had to leave this , too ? Dad wouldn 't let Mom take it . I put it up on eBay . Turns out , not as valuable as Mom thinks . Okay , so here 's the plan . Lunch , beers , finish up the bike . Good ? Good . I picked up a couple steaks . No , you didn 't . You gonna do your ... ? - Aw , yeah . You could take a run at that , you know ... cooking . You 're good . No , I 'm serious . Not as good as I am with engines , but ... That was almost a compliment . So close . I 've thought about it , but ... Breaking news ... we have a shocking video that was sent to our station minutes ago . This facility is controlled by the ATCU . The government is keeping secrets , things we don 't know until cities fall out of the sky . The Avengers ... more like them every day , protected , hidden . Not anymore ! We want this information released ... Whoa . A list of who they are , where they are . Or you will have war on your hands . ¶ ¶ We are the Watchdogs . You will obey . Let 's go ! ¶ ¶ This is ... Awesome . ¶ ¶ Right ? ¶ ¶ I need an agent in South Bend , and you 're the closest one to the scene . Right . It 's just , I 'm here with my brother , and I was hoping this week off would be more of a ... Thing is , Mack , I 'm actually down a couple of agents right now . I know , sir . My resources are limited . Local P.D. ' s already on the scene , and you know the Feds are on a plane . Yes , but ... They 'll pick the site clean , and we 'll have nothing . They hit the ATCU , Mack . It 's serious . I 'm sorry about family time , but we all make sacrifices . Figure it out . ¶ ¶ Hey ... So , it looks like I have to take off for a couple of hours . There was an accident on U.S. 41 . I got to go assess it . Now ? Yeah . It 's complicated . But this is simple . Lunch , beers , bike ? Remember ? We 'll get to it . I promise . ¶ ¶ Were there casualties ? The building had a staff . When you get to South Bend , rendezvous with Mack at the ATCU site . Report back what you got . I 've been following the Watchdogs online for a while now . Some pretty nasty hate speech , but up until now , it 's all been rhetoric . There 's a bark / bite joke I could make here , but I don 't find these guys all that funny . No , they 've had a menacing presence ever since New York . Got even less funny after Sokovia . Not exactly embracing the new changes in the world . Now they 're not happy just being the comments section . Something 's changed . They 're taking action . We need to shut them down before more people get hurt . We 've got enough on our plate trying to track down Malick . Hey ! Hey . How 'd the S.H.I.E.L.D. assessment go ? Fine , I think . I guess we won 't know for sure till Coulson gets the evaluation report . I got it . Well , should we bring Lincoln with us ? With Bobbi and Hunter gone , we can use all the help ... Lincoln 's gonna sit this one out . You and Fitz go ahead . Meet up with Mack , then report back to me . Okay . ¶ ¶ I will do that . ¶ ¶ We get it , Watchdogs , you did this . Yeah . Did you ride that here ? Yeah . Wow . You really are on vacation . Yeah . Vacation . All right , here 's what we know so far . This facility was a storage site for the ATCU . But somehow , the Watchdogs found out . Hey ! Hey . The residue from the bombs , it 's got nitramene in it . I don 't know what that is , but your tone of voice makes it sound bad . Howard Stark developed it after World War II . It causes implosions . That 's weird . Weird how ? That they got their hands on it ? Nitramene isn 't stable enough to be used in a gel-based explosive . Or at least it shouldn 't be . So the Watchdogs have been making improvements to nitramene . J-just to be clear , nitramene ... Actually , I think I 've got some sodium hydrogen acetate back on Zephyr One . That 'll help if we encounter any more bombs , right . Sodium h ... Hydrogen acetate . Neutralizes nitramene . Neutralizes nitramene . Okay . Thank you , Nerd Herd . I 'm gonna go call Coulson . Do we take this debris back with us , study it ? Yeah , sure . If ... if you 've been working out . 'Cause it weighs like 100,000 tons . It 's a building . So ... no , then . Nitramene . Why does that mean something to everyone else but me ? S.H.I.E.L.D. history . Stark tech . And I knew somebody once who was keen on improving the original formula . Okay , well , is that enough to connect that person to the Watchdogs ? He was fixated on it . Thought it might be something we could add to our arsenal . Our arsenal ? A-Are you saying this could be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent ? A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent you 've met . A good man , but he went off the grid when he got out of the hospital , which means he 's at large with a lot of our secrets . He was in the hospital ? After Deathlok broke his spine . Nice work out there , boys . Felix Blake . Gentlemen , I 've got a new plan of attack . And it 's a good one . Someone 's been practicing . You know I don 't like guns , but I 'd rather be prepared . Good . You 're holding your breath , though . Exhale when you pull the trigger . Thanks . Want to tell me what this is about ? Do I need to ? You don 't like feeling vulnerable . Sick of blaming yourself for ... No , I 'm quite comfortable blaming myself , actually , for the lot of it . For all the miseries endured to rescue helpless little Agent Simmons . ¶ ¶ Will died trying to save me . And Fitz ... Poor Fitz nearly got himself killed a number of times , and that 's not even the worst of it . Andrew . What happened to those Inhumane ... not your fault . No , I just let a known murderer loose to save my own skin . Traded all those ... those lives for mine . Well , it won 't happen again . And since I 'm practically the only woman here who can 't kill with her bare hands ... Listen to me . That wasn 't your fault . ¶ ¶ What makes them go from anonymous trash-talking online to ... Domestic terrorism ? Maybe someone stepped in and radicalized them . Maybe Blake . I understand feeling lost . You want to hate something . Hate gives you direction . That could be dangerous . Hey , I used to hate all this alien crap . Used to . But my brother thinks that way . I mean , he 's a good guy , but even he 's cheering on the Watchdogs . They 're not ... they 're not that anonymous . I 've been tracking them , the ones that are spewing hate online . You know , IP addresses , residences , license-plate numbers ... some of them are local . They could 've been involved in the ATCU attack . We should go pick one up and see what he knows . And ... what ? Shake him down ? Without even knowing if the guy we picked was actually involved ? Well , either way , he 'll know something . Yeah , but it 's ... kind of Gestapo , don 't you think ? Is that who we are ? We 're S.H.I.E.L.D. I 'm trying to save lives . I 'll use whatever advantage I have to do it . Yeah , the advantage of superpowers , which is something I don 't have . But I 'm not so sure you should be using yours to sidestep civil liberties . They gave up their right to civil liberties when they started imploding buildings . Maybe , but it 's not about how they act . It 's about how we respond . ¶ ¶ All right , look , I 'm not going along with this . Besides , I made a promise to my brother . Okay , Fitz , you 're with me . Am I ? You 're looking for me ? Yeah . Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake . While he 's out there causing casualties , he 's our top priority . Okay . How can I ... I worked with the guy . I know a few things he doesn 't know I know . You mean that 'll help you find him . Everyone has safehouses . Unbeknownst to Blake , I happen to know where a few of his are , and that 's not to help me find him . It 's to help us find him . Wait . You 're saying I 'm going , too . I am . If we can find any evidence he left behind of his plans , we can stop him . Okay . Great . I mean ... You ... you didn 't say anything about my evaluation , so ... You know , it just seemed like you weren 't happy with what you saw . I 'm not . ¶ ¶ But I want to see it for myself . ¶ ¶ Saving the world , one diligently assessed insurance claim at a time . The gecko and his sidekick , Alfie . Wait . You work for the lady with the funny hair . I always forget . So I guess you had your beers . And yours , too . You weren 't drinking ' em . I get that you 're upset . But ... All right , look , you got to make sure the valve seats right ... It 's not about the damn bikes ! Okay . Then what 's it about ? Nothing , man . Nothing ? Really ? So you 're just being a jackass for no reason ? There 's just a lot going on . Health benefits are about to run out . There 's zero jobs out there . The mortgage isn 't in great shape . Wait , wait a minute . What about the mortgage ? I 'm upside down . Damn it . I 've been trying , okay ? But I was already struggling , then the layoffs happened ... Wait , wait , wait . So is that why you 've been wanting me to hang out ? You know , get some brother time , go to Baja . What , you just wanted to ask me for money ? No ! I suggested Baja because we 've been talking about it since we were kids . And , by the way , I never asked for money . I 'll handle it . Like I handle everything , like with Mom and Dad ... I help out . I helped you move them into the condo . You showed up three days after I moved them in . Even now , I 'm the one that has to keep everything here afloat . We can 't all just run off to some other ... No one put a gun to your head ! You didn 't have to take this house . You could 've sold it . But I didn 't . And now I 'm in default . I can 't afford the house . I can 't afford to leave . This is how they get you . System 's rigged . They want to keep you down and in the dark , man . Hey . You sound like those Watchdog nuts . Well ... they got the right idea . Someone 's got to fight back . The government controls everything . " You either rise up in protest , or you fall down in chains . " That 's a direct quote . Are you reading their stuff ? I go online . They get what I 'm going through . You don 't . You 're only here 'cause your friends left . You stay away from the Watchdogs ! You hear me ? They 're not the answer . No ? Well , what is the answer ? You ? ¶ ¶ Simmons . Here . Everything I have . You 're pursuing Andrew . And I 've retasked a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to look for him . I can 't imagine how hard this must ... Has to be done . Because Andrew is dangerous . You 're not responsible . He is . I just feel guilty ... all the time . How do you make it stop ? You don 't . You use it , channel it . Is that what you 're doing ? I can help . Was hoping you would . You 're doing this wrong . I mean , you 're looking in the wrong place . ¶ ¶ So ... this Blake guy ... he has safehouses , what , all over ? All agents do . We 'll just have to keep checking his until we find something . So , what did it say ... on my evaluation ? Nothing that 'll surprise you . You 're here for Daisy , not the cause . So commitment is a question . But I am here . And your control issues didn 't stop with A.A. You went nuclear on Lash , on Creel . I had reasons both times . But you didn 't follow orders . You can 't just be at S.H.I.E.L.D. You have to be a part of S.H.I.E.L.D. And I 'm trying to be , but you don 't make it easy . There 's a test at every turn . I mean , this is a test . This is a chance for me to see for myself how you handle things . Same thing , different words ... Don 't interrupt me ! You got it ? You haven 't earned that right yet . I don 't know you . I vetted every member of this team except you , measured their commitment to this ideal , including two good agents who just gave it all up to protect that ideal . I think you could be a good agent , but I need to know if you think that and that you want it badly enough . So you stay in control and you follow my orders , and I 'll decide if you get to be an agent or not . Understood ? Yes , sir . I 'm just saying , first , it was the illegal aliens . Now it 's actual aliens putting us all at risk ? And we do need to be tracking them . We have to take our country back . What the hell ? Hi , Dallas . How do you know who I am ? You think I can 't find out who you are when you 're online talking about rounding up freaks just because we 're not face-to-face ? Now we 're face-to-face , and I 'm one of the freaks . But I guess that part was clear . ¶ ¶ I know they 've contacted you . Want you to take action , and ... no doubt , you 've chickened out , but I need you to tell me where they meet . I 'm not telling you anything . Aah ! Okay . Please ... Ple-please don 't hurt me . I won 't have to if you tell me what I want to know . ¶ ¶ So talk . They 're all gathered at a place called Easterling Farms . They 're prepping for their next attack . How 'd you get the information ? I found someone who was willing to talk . Look , the point is , if we leave now , we can stop anyone else from getting hurt . That 's still the mission , isn 't it ? Easterling Farms . That 's over in ... Lake County , right ? Yeah . I 'll text you the location . I 'll meet you there . There 's nothing for me to do here anyway . Hey , Ruben . I didn 't know you were home . I went out . For a bit . Well , I ... I laid out all the parts for the bike . They 're in the right order . All you have to do is install them . Thanks . I 'm making lunch . Bolognese . Veal and pork , if you want some . Yeah , that sounds good , but , um ... I have a thing , so ... ¶ ¶ Andrew isn 't like your other targets . He 's an Inhuman , and an unusual one at that . Andrew ... or Lash , really ... is perhaps being driven by different factors ... biological imperatives , for instance . Climate , feeding , even his need to seek out ... ¶ ¶ Seek out intended victims . Yes . He 's being driven by base instincts . So you 're saying I should think less like a spy , more like a doctor . Exactly . May , what happens to Andrew when you catch up to him ? After everything ... I 'm going to kill him . He 's left us no choice . What if there is a choice ? There 's not . May ... Fitz and I have been working on the vaccine from Creel 's blood . Now , it would only work on Inhumane who haven 't turned yet , but Andrew hasn 't finished his transition . Shouldn 't we at least try ? No . ¶ ¶ Don 't give me hope , Jemma . I don 't want hope . ¶ ¶ It 'd be nice if we weren 't quite so out in the open . Speaking of ... ¶ ¶ Hey . Let 's see what the Watchdogs look like in their natural habitat . ¶ ¶ ... which means only designated team captains will carry a full tactical pack . Know your captain , and if you get in trouble , signal him . That 's Blake 's voice . That 's him . He 's here . ¶ ¶ What are we looking for ? Anything that might be evidence of what Blake is doing . You hear that ? We don 't want to hurt innocents . Still trying to get eyes on Blake . You have permission to defend yourself . The mission comes first . Ruben . Al , look ! Good as new ! Ruben , go home . Go home ! What 're you doing ? What does he think you do ? Insurance . Well , not anymore , I wager . Mack , we 've got to get him out of here . ¶ ¶ Did you see what that guy just did ? I 'll tell the boss . We 're done . Go to black . No , no , we can still ... There are too many ! Go to black ! Are you good to get out of here ? I 've got to go put a lid on this . Yeah . Yeah , we got it . ¶ ¶ Go . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! What 're you doing ? We said we 'd fall back . I have a shot at stopping Blake . I 'm taking it . Call the module . I 'll be back . ¶ ¶ Guys , over here , over here ! We need more help ! Where are you , Blake ? It 's like he disappeared . ¶ ¶ Blake ? How are you here ? I 'm everywhere , Coulson . As are you , apparently . You recovered well . Says the man who came back from the dead . I guess we both have a few tricks up our sleeve , old friend . ¶ ¶ Aah ! ¶ ¶ Fitz ! Fitz ! What 's that ... what 's the stuff called ? Sodium what ? Sodium hydrogen acetate . What ? I don 't think it 's working . Maybe we slowed it down , but ... Must be the modifications that Blake made . What does that mean ? That sooner or later , this bomb is gonna go off . And then I 'll implode . ¶ ¶ Which is gonna be messy . So here we are , reunited at last . I got to admit ... it 's not what I 'd hoped for . I really thought it 'd be ATCU proper who showed up at the compound . Didn 't expect you . I 'm working with the ATCU . You mean keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. alive within it . Those survival instincts of yours , Coulson ... always impressive . I searched for you . I wanted to make you part of the new S.H.I.E.L.D. Yeah , well , when I got out of the hospital , it turned out there had never been a S.H.I.E.L.D. , just Hydra hiding behind one . I signed up to protect the world from these dangerous alien elements . We still do that . The hell you do . You use them , unleash them . You 've got those freaks working for you . Hell , Phil , you are one . Makes me sick . We both know S.H.I.E.L.D. protects mankind . And what has S.H.I.E.L.D. done in the name of protection ? We brought the Chitauri to Earth . I was taken out by one of your cybernetic recruits . And the latest and greatest idea ? The Avengers created Ultron . What are you doing , Blake ? I 'm trying to make the world a safer place ... No . What are you doing now ? Here ? I know your tactics . Speeches ? Not one of them . You 're stalling . Why ? ¶ ¶ Everyone stay back ! Clear the area ! It 's digging into your skin . Yep . I 'm very well-aware , so cutting it off is not an option . I 'll quake it off . No , no , no ! It 's too unstable . Okay , I don 't want to get her involved , but I think we should phone Simmons . We 've got a better way to get the info . ¶ ¶ Okay . I was wondering why you ... you brought him here . What did your people put in the bomb ? Tell us what you did ! I don 't know . Talk or implode . It was you . You 're not getting out of here until you give us answers . I-I don 't know . I 'm not a scientist . Yeah , obviously . Whatever Blake did to suspend the stuff in there , he didn 't tell me . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Hang on . " Suspend " ... that 's a science word that he wouldn 't know . The ... the ... the nitramene is suspended . It 's like ... it 's like a vaccination . That 's why we can 't get to it . What do we do ? We need to stop the substance housing the nitramene . It 's a liquid , so ... We could freeze it . How ? Liquid nitrogen . There 's , um ... we use it in the cooling jets on the containment module . There 's a panel in the corner ! ¶ ¶ Your team in Indiana ... very industrious . Problem is , that 's just one cell . This is nationwide . Tell me something . How 'd you get that ATCU target ? Was it fed to you ? This has Hydra 's fingerprints all over it . Don 't you see ? You were probably cleaning up some mess of theirs . How did you get the location of our compound ? Coercion , by any chance ? I 'm sure it was all aboveboard . We 're solving problems , not making them . We 're spreading an idea . You spread fear . People are already afraid , and they want the truth . What you 're doing 's not about truth . It 's about hate . And you 're above that ? You 've never just killed someone because you hate them , Phil ? ¶ ¶ Hate 's a good motivator . You 're not wrong . This guy ? He 's also filled with hate , and he happens to be one of the Inhumane you 're railing against . Really ? Interesting . He wants to hurt you ... badly . In fact , the only reason he 's not is because he 's trying really hard to follow my orders . So ... I 'm changing my orders . What ? Don 't hurt Agent Blake . Kill him . Sir ? ¶ ¶ That 's an order . Sir , there 's got to be another way . Coulson . Seems your puppy doesn 't have his teeth yet . Lincoln , sometimes we do the wrong thing for the right reason because it has to be done . Now take him out . No . Dissent among the ranks ... ¶ ¶ What the ... ? He was a hologram . Okay . Here we go . You ready ? It 's working . Fitz ... It 's working ! I 'm turning you over to the ATCU . I have a feeling General Talbot will have some questions for you . You knew he wasn 't really here . Yeah , he wasn 't moving much . There was also a lag . Blake usually interrupts you a lot more . I also know that wasn 't a kill shot . I saw you with Lash . Yeah , I just ... I ... You did it right . Offered a dissenting opinion , but when the time came , you did what I asked . Well , a slightly less lethal version . Well-done . We should go through this place , find out if there really is a second target . Blake will send his men . ¶ ¶ Who are you ? I know it 's a lot to take in , but we if we could talk about it ... Sure . Now you want to talk . I can 't believe you , helping those freaks ... Look , that 's not what they are . They 're Inhumane . " Inhumane " ? There 's nothing to be afraid of . What in the hell does that even ... They 're people ! And they 're being hunted . You know , the really stupid part is , I was actually gonna apologize to you ... for not telling you about the house , for hiding things . God , I 'm an idiot . The reason I didn 't tell you is because I ... Stop talking ! You 're a liar . It 's all lies . ¶ ¶ Daisy should be able to access these . Were they preparing for a second target ? He was stalling . But why ? To keep us distracted , but from what ? From talking to our people ? But we 'd already sent agents to his ... to his compound . Blake kept talking about you working with ... freaks . He must 've known that you 'd send some of us on the raid . He didn 't have a second target . He wanted one ... an Inhuman ... someone for his men to go after . We brought him Daisy . What ? ¶ ¶ It was all talk for so long . " Get a powered person and kill it . " But then you all were there , and we got to see a real , live freak fire a shock wave . Only thing is , we didn 't think it was a ... tiny , unassuming little girl . If we did , we 'd have gone after you instead . What do you mean " instead " ? ¶ ¶ Why didn 't you just tell me ? ! It was complicated . It 's always complicated with you . Ruben , I wanted to keep you away from all this . That 's true of the Watchdogs , too . You 're angry and aimless , but I didn 't want them roping ... Screw you ! Better than being blindsided ! You don 't believe that . What do you know about me ? You 've been so busy protecting freaks , you haven 't even ... Not just them ! People ! Damn it , that 's why I joined S.H.I.E.L.D ... to protect the people I care about , to protect you . What was that ? ¶ ¶ All right ! Let 's kill this freak ! They torched our bikes . We can 't get away . Looks like the Watchdogs followed us . I guess now we 're the ones being hunted . But we 're not ... Inhumane ? It doesn 't matter . Your new heroes will still kill us . Can 't we just make a break for it ? No , that 's not a good idea . It 's too wide open out front . They 'll pick us off before we get too far . So what do we do ? I 'm thinking . Let 's split up . Check all the rooms . Wait . Split up . We got find them . They got to be here somewhere . Can 't be more than five . And they 're spread out . Okay , all right . Did ... did Dad take his shotgun with him to the Florida condos ? No , it 's still there . He doesn 't have any slugs , just bird shot . That 'll work . All right . Back of the house is woods , so that 's the new goal ... to get to the backdoor in the kitchen . Then we slip out into the woods and escape . So , this is what you do at S.H.I.E.L.D. ? This kind of stuff ? Ruben , I 'm a mechanic . I hate this stuff . ¶ ¶ You 've made it dark . I have . Won 't that make it hard for us to see them coming ? Yeah . But it also means they won 't be able to see us . And we know our way around this house with our eyes closed . Aah ! The rest 'll be coming now , so stay alert . ¶ ¶ You ever use one of these before ? An assault rifle ? Yeah . No . Obviously , you have . Talk me through it . If it moves , shoot it . And try not to shoot yourself . Or me . I 'll clear the entryway . You follow . ¶ ¶ We got to go . ¶ ¶ Hey , hey ! Hey , stay ... step away from the door . How many shooters did you see upstairs ? Just the one . Are you sure ? Then we only found three Watchdogs . Where are the other two ? ¶ ¶ So that 's it . We can go out the ... Shh . ¶ ¶ They must 've figured out this was our escape route . They 're waiting for us . Did they see us ? No . If they did , they would 've been in here by now . They 're gonna be a problem if we want to get out of here . Look , we need ... No ! ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ That lock won 't hold . ¶ ¶ What the hell are you doing ? Shotgun axe . ¶ ¶ Aah ! ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ You beat them . You did that . This is why I didn 't tell you . ¶ ¶ He 'll be okay ? Yeah , yeah . He 'll be fine . They 're taking him to a facility nearby . It 's one of ours . I 'll drive you . You all right ? I 've never ... All those men ... here ... He had to shoot them to ... I know , I know . It 's a lot to take in . But you 're safe now . But S.H.I.E.L.D. will take all the wounded men into custody , and Damage Control will clean up . S.H.I.E.L.D. Alfie works for S.H.I.E.L.D. He 's one of the best ... Did you just call him " Alfie " ? Wow . Thank you . I cannot wait for him to get back from recovery now . What do you call him ? Mack . That 's what my buddies call me . He said his friends took off ? Yeah . Yeah . But not all of them . And now that you know about us , we might give you a ring . Your brother says you 're a good wheel man . And you 're his partner . Yeah . And I should 've been here for him . I could 've stopped them . He seemed to handle things fine . He 's good at it ? Saving people ? When I need someone to watch my back , he 's the person I want . Okay . Good . You still want that ride , Mini Mack ? You were right . The ATCU attack was a cover . Found surveillance video . This is about an hour before the implosion . We ran the plates . Company car . Malick ? You win . This wasn 't an act of terrorism . - It was a distraction and a cover-up . - Sponsored by Hydra . Malick 's firing up the Watchdogs , feeding them intel . If they got that kind of funding , they 're not going anywhere . And Malick ? God only knows what he took from there . ¶ ¶ I kept my part of the deal . Now I expect you to keep yours . I want weaponry . And not that Stark Industries reissue crap . I 'm talking about the big guns . So we can finally hunt down these freaks . Yes . Freaks . If everything goes as planned , we 'll all get what we want , Mr. Blake . Our common enemies will be dead , and you 'll have troops , armed to the teeth , at your command . Yeah . Sounds right . ¶ ¶

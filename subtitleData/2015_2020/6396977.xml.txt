 Thirty seconds and counting . Power transfer is complete . We 're on internal power with the launch vehicle at this time . T minus 20 seconds and counting . All 2nd stage tanks now pressurized . T minus 15 seconds . Guidance is internal . Twelve , eleven , ten , nine , Ignition sequence starts . six , five , four , three , two , one , zero . All engines running . Lift off ! We have a lift-off ! And so , in 1972 , the Atlas Centaur rocket blasted off from our planet , a 4-stage rocket that launched a probe way out into the blackness of space . The probe would use the energy from the sun and the gravitational pull of our neighbouring planets to cross our solar system . That momentum would then carry it on into the farthest reaches of the universe . The mission : to find intelligent life similar to ours , out there , in deep space . The probe carried a tablet with an image inscribed of us humans , a man and a woman , and a map to locate us in the universe . Stage four disconnects , and our probe is fired on its long journey . The world wished it bon voyage . May it find a friend out there in deep space . [ Subtitles by davideisaura ] Welcome , ladies and gentlemen . When I interviewed Neil Clarke for the " Book Programme " I knew he was extraordinary . Now with the publication of his brilliant novel , reviewers agree he 's joined the ranks of Britain 's immortals . Ladies and gentlemen , Neil Clarke . I suppose I want to start off by asking you how did you manage such amazing insight into the soul of modern man , and how do you know what men and women really want , just really the whole relationship between humanity and the cosmos ? Well I think I probably achieved that by looking into my own soul , Catherine . I studied its flaws , its potential , its urgent needs . I listened to its cries for help , its yelps of anguish , and I spent five long years on a book which would open the doors of human perception , and allow us to be enguilfed in a sense of our own futility . Sorry about this . It - Get off ! Go watch TV . Your dog is barking . My dog was barking because you rang the doorbell . I rang the doorbell because your dog was barking . Your lease says no pets . Well he is a guide dog . You 're not blind . I prefer the term optically challenged . You 're not optically challenged either . Fiona , you live like three floors up . I mean - If you don 't control your bloody dog , I 'll have it sent to Battersea Dogs ' Home . All right ? All right . Come on Dennis , let 's go and evacuate your bowels . Come on , Dennis . Come on . - Hello , Neil . - Oh hi , Catherine . It 's funny , I was just dreaming about you . Really ? Yes , you were presenting me with an award for my novel . - Did you deserve it ? - I was proud , but humble . Have you finished it , actually , in real life ? - Absolutely . Almost , yes . - Because you were in chapter ... Yes , I renumbered them . In fact , I 've removed them . I find the concept of chapters just gets in the way , so ... Yeah . Yeah , I can see that . I wanted reading it to feel like being sucked into a giant vortex . You know . - Like going on Facebook . - Yes , like Facebook . Good one . " Like being sucked into a giant vortex . " Dennis , why do you let me say things like this ? Hey , come on . [ Alien language . ] - Come on Ray , it 's only 20 quid . - I can 't , Neil . - But it can 't lose ! - No . I guarantee you a 50 % return before the end of classes today . So when you do you make your move on Miss " Booker Prize " downstairs ? I don 't . Turns out she 's a bit literal minded . No foresight . Whereas me , I can see miles into the future . A man needs a woman , Neil . - I 've got Dennis . - Dennis is male . And he 's a dog , in case you haven 't noticed . I don 't want to complicate my life . This is a tenner ! Walk ! [ Alien language . ] Accessing representative images of Earthlings . Communication will be carried on in the language of the species to be judged . I 'm sorry , I 'm not understanding . - Is that better ? - Understanding you now , Sharon . By the power investd in me by the Intergalactic Council of Superior Species , I hereby pronounce a destruction order on the planet Earth . With great respect , Sharon , we should not pronounce a destruction order before we 've given these Earthlings a chance to prove themselves . - They penetrated intergalactic space ! - Maureen is right . They 're clearly not a superior species . Look at the way they copulate ! If these Earthlings can convince us that they are superior beings , they may join our society . If they cannot , we must eliminate them , for the moral wellbeing of the entire intergalactic community . - Thank you for explaining that , Sharon . - Not at all , Miss Barker . No , Grant , I don 't want to talk to you . I don 't want to see you , either . We had a great time last night , but it 's over . What part of over do you not understand ? Thank you for calling . Bye bye . These questions of yours make me sound as if I thought this bloody author can string two words together . - He can . It 's a wonderful book . Darling , didn 't you read the memo ? We 're doing a demolition job . But it 's the best thing he 's ever written . Everyone says so . That 's why we have to pee on it from a great height . I want ten new questions , please . Before noon . Don 't you know ? She never reads the books . She hates books . Why 's she presenting a book program , then ? I spy trouble . Now Catherine , you may despise her ego , but that 's what viewers tune in to see . Not books , not authors , god forbid ! But Fenella 's rampant , pulsating , sexually arousing ego . But I think people watch becaue it 's a book program , and they love books . Books are finished . Our job is to provide scandal , gossip and character assassination , with a thin veneer of literary respectability . Then we 're not just selling out , we 've sold out . Exactly . For God 's sake , smile ! It 's enough to make you weep , isn 't it . What ? The price of pickles . Don 't even look at the marinated herring . Honestly , it 'd be suicidal . I didn 't want them anyway . Thanks . I also offer support and counseling on dips , dried fruit and pasta sauces . She 's gone . - The usual test , Sharon ? - The usual test , Kylie . One Earthling will be chosen randomly , as defined by the Intergalactic Manual of Good and Evil . - Page 56 , paragraph B. - Page 56 , paragraph D. Oh . Right . To prove that they understand the difference between good and evil . How will they prove it ? You will be given the power that all superior beings have . The Earthling be capable of doing absolutely anything . What if he uses his power for evil ? The earth will be eliminated . And if he uses it for good ? Then we welcome them to the intergalactic community . Are we ready , gentlemen ? Commencing random selection of earthlings . Processing . Processing . Earthling ... - Jolly good ! - Wait . ... selected . The Earthling has ten days to prove he can use absolute power for good , rather than for evil . God ! Screw you ! All they want me to do is sneer at people who wrote wonderful books . My producer just wants me to dig up dirt on Amenhotep III . I keep telling them he had a kind nature , and lovely hands . I 'd've loved to spend an evening with Amenhotep III . Yeah , except he 's been dead 4,000 years , Rosie . You spend all day long talking about embalming . - Well find me a good one still breathing . - Tell me about it . - What about Grant ? - ' Colonel ' Grant turned out to have issues . - Issues ? - Yes . Clinically insane . - That 's a shame . - Maybe that 's overstating it . He 's just obsessive , possessive and pathologically jealous . - What about him upstairs ? - He tried to cheer me up in the supermarket . Oh , so he 's gay . What ? Well he 's sympathetic , interested , available ... That 's the way life works . No , he 's not gay . He 's ... very likeable . Mr Clarke . Hi . This is the 12th time you 've been late this month . - I got knocked off my bike . - Yesterday you had food poisoning . Friday , you thought it was Saturday . - Monday you forgot to put your clock forward . - Everydody does that . A week last Wednesday you had an appointment with the Dalai Lama . - Yes , I showed you the picture . - That had Michael Jackson in it as well . Well he 's a great man . Great enough to appear in photographs when he 's dead . You , Mr Clarke , are totally irresponsible . You are idle and feckless . - Feckless ? - Yes , you 're without ' feck ' . If I could replace you , I would . Yeah , well so would I. I just have no one to replace me with . Hello , gorgeous . How about cocktails for two this evening ? Go halves ? Drop dead , Ray . All right . Think about it and get back to me . Knob . - Neil ? - Yeah . If you could do anything , what would you do ? Hello Neil , love . Tinned mouse or fricassee of war victim ? - I 'll have the roast headmaster , please . - You 're a one ! - There you go . - Thank you . I 'll have the casserole please . You 'll enjoy that , Mr. Ray , as long as you don 't eat it . If you could make anything you want happen , what would it be ? I 'd make Dennis regurgitate my notes for chapter three . - I mean make something impossible happen . - Intact . What if you could make someone worship the ground you walked on ? Even if she thought you were a little shit ? That would be taking unfair advantage of an innocent girl . Suppose there was one thing you could do to change your life for the better . Easy . I 'd made alien spaceships destroy 10C . That sounded like it was in the school . Out of the way ! Out of the way ! Stand back ! Stand back ! Stay calm . Oh my god ! Who was that ? It was the salubrious Gat of galaxy G946WOT . - Gat , what do you think you 're doing ? - Just practicing , Sharon . We have 't done the judicial review yet . We may not want to destroy this species . Who are you kidding ? 445,349,722 new alien species encountered . How many have been granted membership of the intergalactic community ? Zero . - We have high standards . - You know you 're going to wipe them out . It all depends on the Earthling . The signs of a recovery seem as far away as ever . Hey , hello Dennis . Oh Dennis , couldn 't you have waited ? We now go live to our reporter Brenda Emmanus , at the scene of the incident . It was here at Kinbrook Comprehensive that an explosion killed 38 pupils . A police spokesman said they could not rule out a terrorist attack , but they say it had no connection with reports of a UFO sighting in the area . The head teacher , Mr Robert - Oh sure , Dennis . It was an alien spaceship . What are you talking about ? If I could make an alien spaceship destroy 10C , I wouldn 't be farting around with this , would I. I 'd just say , " Dog mess , clean yourself up . " See ? It 's just shock . It 's just post-hallucination shock . That 's all it is . It couldn 't have been an alien spaceship , could it ? I mean it couldn 't have . Oh my God . My notes . Damn it ! Whisky ... go back in the bottle . See ? You see ? There 's nothing . Nothing . Nothing . Whiskey , go back in the bottle . Oh my god ! I have to wave my hand ! Whisky ... Exchange yourself for another bottle . A single malt ! Hey , come back ! Door open , quick ! Not that quick ! I didn 't mean go back to the shop to to get exchanged ! It 's closed ! Oh , shit ! Gotcha ! - Golf Yankee , 10-3 , 10-3 , priority . - Help me , Dennis ! Dennis , be quiet . Shit . All right , laddie . You 're nicked . Make me at home having dinner with Dennis . Oh , yuck ! Dog food ! You say one word about this , constable , and you 'll be on community relations . Oh my god . 10C ! Let everyone who died be alive again ! Oh god ! No no no ! I wanted everyone in 10C to be alive again , obviously not everone who 's ever died ever ! Are you crazy ? Shit , shit ! And let everyone who died in the bomb blast be completely uninjured ! Shit , shit , shit ! Uh okay . Me : feel better . Oh , that 's better . Me : have a really good idea about what to do next . Oh , that 's a good idea . Let the explosion never have happened . If you could make anything you wanted happen , what would it be ? I 'm sorry , what ? If you could do anything , what would you do ? That 's very weird . I think I just dreamt that I could . - What ? - Do anything . I dreamt that if I could just wave my hand and say such and such , it would happen . So what did you do ? I made alien spaceships destroy 10C . Good thinking . I would make Dorothy Pringle worship the ground I walked on . You wouldn 't be so cruel ! Hello , and welcome to Book News , the show where you get to know which books are coming to you , and authors get what 's coming to them . What 's the truth under publishers ' blurbs ? Why do writers ' photographs always show them looking ten years younger ? You 've come to the right place to find out . Our first guest tonight is Mortimer Stanley , whose latest novel is entitled , " What you see with your eyes open " . Mortimer , your last novel was published nearly ten years ago . It got what they call " mixed reviews " , and sold fewer than 3,000 copies . - What possessed you to write another one ? - Well , my wife was dying . You were estranged , weren 't you ? Yes , but on her deathbed she urged me to write another book . - Knowing she wouldn 't have to read it . - Well ... Fenella 's complaining you didn 't tell her about his shoplifting conviction . He was 14 , James . It has nothing to do with his book . Neither has the show , Cath . Listen , what upsets Fenella about you is your integrity . But me , I quite like it . Play your cards right , and you could get your own office , with a bigger desk and a view . Sorry . Excuse me . Mind you , you have to play your cards right . What the hell are you doing here ? - Oh don 't I get a kiss ? - Please go away . That wouldn 't fair to you , Cath . This is a wonderful opportunity for you to get to know the real me . Well I 'm calling security . Not just the charming , high - flying military strategist . Hello . Security ? Not the inventor of extreme rendition , either . I have an intruder in room 405 . Or the mastermind behind warrentless domestic surveillance . Just a humble officer who adores you . - Grant , I appreciate that you like me . - Like ? Like ? You think I 'm one of these carboard cutouts ? No , no . Adulate . Worship . OK , well I don 't adulate or worship you . In fact , I don 't really like you . So just go away and leave me alone . - So there 's some hope ! - No , no . There 's no hope . Cath , I came all the way to England to see you . Doesn 't that show how much I care about you ? No , it shows that you 're obsessed . That 's not a quality I admire . Really . I think the lady wants you to go , Colonel . You work for the BBC , don 't you . I do . Do you know who ultimately controls the BBC ? A guy who used to work down the hall from me at Fort Bragg . And he did it in his spare time . I 'll catch you later , honey . It was a party . I was doing a documentary . I was drunk . You 're judging me . I 'd like 10C to become a model class , kind and considerate and eager to learn . - Good afternoon , 10C . - Good afternoon , Mr. Clarke . Could you all turn to page 73 , please , and read the entire chapter . - What , the whole chapter ? - Yes . Oh , good . How exciting ! He 's letting us read the whole chapter ! Great ! Well get on with it , then . Let the headmaster be nice to me for a change . That is not how Kumbaya goes ! Neil , so good to see you ! What you 're wearing really does make a great ensemble ! So similar to what you were wearing before . Your laissez-faire approach is a great counterpoint to my by-the-book approach ! - Great having you on the staff ! - Thank you . He must love you a lot to fly across the Atlantic . But I can 't bear losing everything . Grant sees me as lost property he wants to retrieve , and put on the mantlepiece . He was really scary . Crazy . I had a boyfriend like that once . - He wouldn 't take no for an answer . - What happened ? I married him . You know the Romance languages ? French , Italian ? Yes Miss Pringle . I teach them . - I was wondering how they got thair names . - It 's to do with Ancient Rome . From the Latin . Then it 's just coincidence they sound so romantic . Actually , I 'm thinking of switching ... to economics . May Miss Pringle worship Ray . Ray ! I can do abso-fucking - lutely anything ! Me : be President of the United States . That 's funny . - Thank god we found you , sir . We 've been looking everywhere ! Oh my god ! Sorry about that , Mr. President . Here are the papers for Syria , the deficit , Israel and the Middle East , China , global warming , unemployment and the Arctic , sir . Me : be my old self at home ! I can do ... anything . But what do I really want ? Give me a really big dick . Not that big , obviously ! Dick , return to the old size . Okay , um ... let me have a penis that women find exciting . Yes , that 's good . Can I have it in white ? Right , okay . Um ... let me have a really great body . No , look . Give me the body of a great man . What the frig ? Not Albert Einstein ! Let me have the great body of a man . Make me able to see Catherine from downstairs . Now . Shit . Let me not be able to see her ! No ! I don 't mean make me go blind ! Let me able to see , and the floor as it was . Catherine from downstairs : forget what just happened . Quiet ! Quietly ! Um ... Ray , you know we were talking earlier , about being able to do anything ? Oh , yeah . - Yeah , well ... This will sound kind of stupid , but ... suddenly I can . - Can what ? - Do anything . Just make things happen . Things that shouldn 't happen . I wave my hand , and they do . Are you okay ? Yeah . Look . You : tell us who you were . You 'll never believe this , but I was a conjurer , The Great Alfredo . My real name is Reg Hoskins . I did variety , clubs , private parties , the lot . What is this , 3D projection or something ? Of course it 's all gone now . I blame the wogs . - Hey ! - All that black minstrel stuff . - Once they started that ... - It 's not me ! When Jews took over the business , it was never the same . - Go jump out the window ! - Right-ho ! Watch this . - How did you do that ? - I don 't know . I would swear it was the skeleton talking . - Yeah , it was . - Okay . - Do something else . - What ? I can 't think of anything . Oh come on ! You know , how about some ... flowers ? A bunch of flowers in my hand . It 's pathetic . How about ... room : be covered in flowers . Come on , Ray ! Think of something more imaginative ! Bloody hell , Palmer , did you throw this out the window ? Neil , did you throw this out the window ? That 's very funny . Why are you here ? Go home , I 'll cover for you . Oh my god ! - This is the best sandwich ever . - Told you . You know what ? We could own a racehorse . Ray , we could own every racehorse in the world . No shit ! - We win every time ? - They 're all ours . Let 's forget about horses . We can have anything , Neil . Wealth , fame ... women ! We could make any woman fall in love with us ! Neil , any woman we want ! Good night , Catherine . See you later . Jump in , babe . Kerb-crawling is illegal in this country , Grant . That doesn 't apply to people with my security clearance . - Besides , how 're you gonna get home ? - On the tube . Go away . The London Underground is worse than anything we did in Guantanamo . - You don 't deserve that ! - I don 't deserve this either ! - Plase leave me alone ! - Okay , I get it ! - But you gotta let me down gently . - What does that mean ? - There 's someone else , right ? - No , Grant , that 's not it . You and I are not compatible . Then we could grab some coffee . Sit and talk . What would that achieve ? There 's nothing to talk about ! Except the luxury apartment I rented for us . It has a view of St. Paul 's cathedral . My god . Go home , Grant ! - Here 's the key . - I don 't want it . When you get up there , you 'll think you died and went to heaven . Fuck all TV producers ! Especially those who say you can sleep with them . By ' playing my cards right ' . Why do I always end up with the control freak ? - Or gays . - Yeah . - Who ? - Him upstairs . Honey , he 's not gay . He 's attractive . Kind . Well then ... fuck him . - No , he 's nice ! - I didn 't mean that . I mean ... fuck him . You mean fuck him ! What , right now ? No , not now ! You have to let me do your makeup first . Malfunction . Galactic power failure . Bother ! We 'll have to suspend the test . - What ? - It 's on the blink , Sharon . We won 't have galactic power until I get it working again . Bother ! I thought our galactic powers meant we could do anything ! Catherine from downstairs : be madly in love with me . That was quick ! - Hi . - Hi . - You 're not gay , are you ? - No , I 'm not . - Let 's go to bed . - Okay . Oh , shit ! Ow ! My leg ! Got it ! Galactic power returning to the Earthling . 'Gone to get ready for work . ' Weather : be like it is in Los Angeles . I didn 't mean like it is right now ! It 's night there , for crying out loud ! Weather : be like it usually is in Los Angeles during the day . Pedantic ! Clothes : get dressed on me . Smarten yourselvs up Better . Miss Pringle , this really has to stop . - Oh , Lord ! - Oh , Lord ! Okay . Ow ! Can you stop that , please ? And you , stop tapping ! Let 's have a break , shall we ? Right , what 's next ? Oh . This one 's in German . Let me understand German . [ Speaks German . ] What are you talking about , Dennis ? Just shut up , okay ? I can handle this . She won 't ask me to marry her , or have my children , okay ? Dennis , what are you talking about ? Good idea , actually . What ARE you talking about ? Dennis : be able to talk . Biscuits . - What ? - Biscuits ! Maybe if I make her fall in love with me a little bit ? - Not want to get married , just to have sex - - Biscuits ! - They 're in the cupboard ! - What are ? Biscuits ! Red biscuits , black biscuits ... - ... nothing else matters ! - Is that all you think about ? Yes ! Biscuits ! All right . Dennis : become a rational thinking creature . Look , I can 't concentrate until I have one of those biscuits . It 's crazy , but that 's how it is . I guess I 'm hooked . So give me just one , and I 'll be able to think about something else . Makes sense . He 's getting the biscuits ! Yeah ! He 's got them ! He 's got them ! Get ready , get ready ! Here it comes ! It must be terrible , being a dog . - I didn 't know you had such cravings . - It 's like you and that bitch . - What Bitch ? - The bitch you shagged last night ! My god ! She 's not a bitch , okay ? She 's a lovely human female . - And we weren 't just shagging . - Right . Come to think of it , I wouldn 't mind shagging your leg right now . Just above the sock . Come on , Daddy . I thought I 'd made you into a rational thinking creature . Rational thinking creatures still have desires . Well we 'll soon deal with that ! No , don 't take away my desires ! Why not ? They 're what makes my life worth living . Biscuits and shagging . I don 't like your conversation . But I worship you , Master ! I love you so much . - I can 't bear displeasing you . - I know . My world collapses when you 're cross with me . Maybe it was better when you didn 't talk . No , don 't take away my power of speech , not now that I can think rationally ! It would be so cruel ! I heard the bell ! Someone 's at the door ! - The bell again ! - Dennis , good dog . - There 's somebody ! Hey ! - Quiet . There 's somebdy at the door ! Did I do something wrong again ? No , just be quiet ! Do you understand me ? Yes . Anything to stop you being angry with me . The bell ! There it goes again ! Dennis , listen . Listen , listen . Be quiet . - That is an order . - Right . - Quiet . - I like obeying orders , especially yours . Good . Well then shut the fuck up . Right . I 'll shut up . Good boy . God ! I made her do it ! I made her do it . I did . - Hi . - Hey . - Can I come in ? - Yes , yes , yes , of course . - Look , about last night ... - Yes . - Is this a bad time ? - No , nope . I don 't want you to think I do that sort of thing all the time . Because I don 't . - I was slightly drunk . - Yeah , well , I mean naturally . Otherwise , we probably wouldn 't have done that thing with the - No , that 's not what I mean . I mean , I like you . I 've always really enjoyed talking to you . But I probably wouldn 't have jumped on you like that - if I hadn 't ... - Been pissed as a newt . Well sort of . Okay , so let 's forget it . It never happened . No , that 's not what I meant , Neil . Well what did you want , then ? Shag her , Neil ! That 's Dennis . - Dennis ? - Yeah . He 's a plumber . I 'm having problems with my waterworks . - With the pipes . - Shag her , Neil ! I 'd better get him the shagger . It 's a special wrench plumbers use . - I told you to shut up . - I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . You 're supposed to be a rational thinking creature . Sorry , I can 't help myself . I want to shag your leg . It 's not a great time . Maybe later , if you behave . Couldn 't find the shagger , so we went with the decoupler . - I love you , Neil ! - Shut up , Dennis ! It 's odd , isn 't it . Shouting at a plumber like that . But the fact is , he 's my brother . The plumber 's my brother . Say you love me , Neil ! - And we 're very close . - God , Rosie was right . - Rosie ? - Please can I shag your leg ? Jesus , Neil , how could you ? The next morning ! Why do I always end up with creeps ? - I 'm not a creep ! - There 's a cat , Neil ! You ! Hey you , cat ! Get out of my garden ! Neil , it 's a ginger tom ! Dennis , be a dumb animal again for five minutes ! So she thinks I 'm gay . I mean , so what , you know ? It means she won 't want to marry me or have my kids . Bingo . Problem solved . Thank you , Dennis . Catherine ! Catherine ! Me : be on the bus . I didn 't mean ON the bus , I meant IN the bus ! Not in the engine ! In the passenger section ! Catherine ! Catherine ! - Ray ? - You gotta stop Miss Pringle ! She 's set up shrines all over the school . Even a website ! - You wanted her to worship you ! - Not like this ! - I don 't have time for this . - Wait ! Have you lost your powers ? No , I haven 't . - You have ! - I haven 't lost the power ! - Do the thing . - Ray : be a duck ! Ray , stop it ! Stop it ! Ray : become a sausage . I haven 't lost the powers , okay ? Where is he , Neil ? Oh , that 's his car ! - Behold the car of Ray ! - The car of Ray ! Catherine , can we talk ? - No . - But I love you . You also love Dennis . - Did you take that off there ? - No , this is mine . - Yours ? - Yep . - Look , you 've got it all wrong about Dennis . - I have nothing against him . You loves him , he loves you . I 'm happy for you . Just don 't bring me into it . I have to tell you something about Dennis . You have to pay for that . You touched it . - It 's mine ! - No , it isn 't . I heard what you said to each other , Neil . There 's something about Dennis you need to know . - I don 't want to hear it , Neil . - I 'm just saying he 's not a man ! You pervert ! You come in here and steal our stuff ! I told you , that 's not your sausage ! - It 's mine ! - Let go ! - Give me 80p ! - All right ! - I 'll get your change . - Never mind ! - No , it 's 4 pounds 20 . - Keep it ! - It 's too much for a tip . - Have it your way . I should think so , too . Sausage : become Ray . Jesus ! Have you any idea how vulnerable a sausage feels ? There he is ! I 'm off ! Leave me alone ! There you go . You must have been hungry . It 's clear he has no idea of doing any good whatsoever . Why can 't we just get on with the ... destruction ? Because there are rules , Maureen . We must follow galactic procedure . Rules didn 't stop you eating the inhabitants of G4378 , Janet . They were delicious . Very crunchy , as I recall . - Surprise ! - Oh my god ! No ! Wait ! Hey ! You 're crazy , do you know that ? - Crazy in love , darlin ' . - Get out of my flat , Grant ! - I can 't , you locked the door . - Go out the way you got in . Oh honey , come on now . That ain 't nice ! Get out , Grant ! I never want to see you again ! Get out of my life ! Get out ! Come on now , open the door ! Sorry . Sorry about the noise . At least he wasn 't barking ! Fuck off . Not you . Go out and sneak in the back way to my place . No funny business . Just stay out of his way . I 'll make you dinner . I hate doors ! Okay , but invite Dennis . Let 's behave like grownups . - Okay . - Catherine , come back . - I 'm leaving ! - Okay , I 'm coming ! Wait for me ! She 's coming for dinner ! Hey ! This is about the stars ! She 's coming to dinner ! Who ? - Catherine . - Oh , the bitch . Don 't call her that , okay ? I don 't want you chipping in either . - Just pretend to be a dumb animal again . - Me ? A dumb animal ? You know how to pretend . It 's called acting . Like when I 'm having my tummy tickled ? - You love having your tummy tickled ! - No I don 't . - What ? - It 's a sham , Neil . All dogs do it . Why ? Why do humans like tickling dogs ' tummies ? Because dogs love it . Dogs pretend to like it , because they know humans like doing it . Well , just pretend to be a perfectly ordinary dog . Can I join in the conversation just a little bit ? No . That is so cruel ! Someone at the door ! Hey ! It 's the bell ! It 's the bell ! - I know it 's the bell , Dennis ! - Right . No . Sorry . One more peep and the flea collar is going on again . Right , right . Sorry , sorry . Bark . Woof . Do it properly . Yes , good . Thank you . I 'll get it . - Is he gone ? - No , I don 't think so . Dennis , down ! - Named him after the plumber ? - Uh , yeah . You want your tummy tickled ? Why do dogs like that so much ? I don 't ... The producer promised me a new office with a big desk and a view , but he was just trying to get me into bed . What did you want to tell me ? Just try this first . It 's incredible ! It 's the most wonderful thing I 've ever tasted in my life ! I had no idea you were such a fantastic cook ! It 's unlike anything I 've ever tasted . What is it ? I just said , " Let the soup be the most amazing thing Catherine 's ever tasted , unlike anything she 's tasted before " , and ... it is ! - Really ? - Really . I can make things happen . Anything . It 's what I was trying to tell you this morning . I wasn 't talking to live-in gay plumber , I was talkin to Dennis . - The dog ? - Dennis the dog . But he answered you back . Yeah . Because I made him talk . - Oh . - With my powers . Special powers . You want a bigger desk ? You got it . Want a great view ? You got it . Neil , how long have you had these special powers ? - They came on very suddenly . - Suddenly ? Yeah , I was knocked off my bike . Ask me to do something . Anything . Listen Neil , it 's okay , - you can get help . - Son of a bitch ! - Shit ! Grant ! - I 'm outta here ! There 's no one else , huh ? - Who is this guy ? - She didn 't tell you ? - I 'm her fiance . - You 're not my fiance , Grant . Yeah ? And you weren 't making out with this apology of a man ? Stop this ! You know how long you 'd last on a battlefield , soldier ? - I 'm sorry , Neil . - That long . - I 'm warning you . - You 're warning me ? - Yes , I 'm warning you . - Ha ! Who is this guy ? - Suck on this , asshole ! - Grant ! All I have to do is go like this , and say ... what ? - Where did you find this fruitcake ? - Put that away , Grant . What can I say ? Grant : become a fairy ? It 's Grant , not Graahnt . - Stop it ! - You 're the goddam fairy ! How about : Graahnt , go back to where you came from ? - It 's Grant ! - How about kiss my arse , Graahnt ? Neil , don 't . He 's crazy . How about saying , " Please , Grant , don 't put a bullet through my brain ? " Grant , stop it . I prefer , " Let all bullets bounce off me . " Go on , shoot me . My god , you 're both crazy ! - He doesn 't dare ! - Neil , please . Please ! Come on , pull the trigger . What 's the matter , Grant ? - Shut up ! - Go on , shoot me ! - Neil , he will ! - No he won 't . - Yes I will . - No , you won 't ! Grant , drop the gun . You shit-head ! - You 're idiots , both of you . - I wouldn 't do this if I were you . God , I hate the English ! Let Graahnt 's arm break if he tries to throttle me ! Shut up ! It 's Grant ! - Help ! Help ! Help ! - Who the heck was that ? That 's Dennis . It 's just a dog ! English dick ! - Shit ! Shit ! What happened ? - Want me to make it better ? - It hurts ! - Let Grant 's arm be better . - Hey , what is this ? - Let Grant be stuck on the ceiling . - Shit ! - Let Grant be plastered to the wall . Wait ! Wait ! Let 's talk about this ! Let Grant be buried head first in the plant plot . Let Grant be standing in front of me . You want to be nice to me , Grant . Maybe I can help you . You ? I could make your life absolute hell , or I could say , " Grant be holding a million dollars . " Or I can say : " Million dollars : disappear . " Oh come on ! I can do anything . I just have to wave my hand . - You gotta wave your hand ? - That 's right . Isn 't he great ? I love you ! I love you so much . - Dennis , keep out of this . - But you are great , Neil . - You can do anything . - Dennis , shut up . Master ! Neil ! Hi . Made your mind up yet ? - How about tonight ? - Good girl . - Eight o 'clock , my place . - I always pick the wrong guy anyway . Oh , and ... I got you a new desk . It 's abut time . Now listen up . When I take that gag out , you say exactly what 's on that piece of paper , understand ? If you say a word that 's not on that piece of paper , I 'll kill the dog . - Don 't let him shoot me , Neil . - Do you understand ? Nod if you understand . Okay , I 'm gonna take the gag out now . Remember ! One wrong word , and the dog gets it . Okay , read ! - Item number 1 . - Let 's go . - Come on ! - ' All pasty white Englishmen ... All pasty white Englishmen to get ... big ears and webbed feet ' ? Now wave your hand . - What ? - Wave your hand ! Yes ! Beautiful . Neil ! Neil ! Neil ? Neil ? - You don 't worship me , do you ? - What ? Ray . You 're Ray . - I can 't find Neil . - Is he here ? No , he wasn 't in school , either . I left him with my crazy , gun-toting ex-boyfriend . - Neil has powers . - I know , I know . He made Miss Pringle worship me , and it 's turned into a religion . - They think I 'm immortal . - So what ? They want me to prove it , by rising from the dead . We 've got to find Neil . Wait ! Hey , what are you doing ? No ... Got it ! - Where 's your car ? - Why ? I know where they are . It 's just out here . We can ... - Shit . - Lord ! Oh , no . Run for it ! Get him ! Lord ! Yeah ! This is working beautifully ! Okay , keep going . Number three . Okay . " Three : all British police to have pink uniforms . " Ha ha ! My personal favorite ! Come to us ! Ray ! Ray ! What 's this all about ? There he is ! Beautiful ! I can 't believe it ! All right , next one . Go on , read . " Let all traffic lights be permanently ... green ! ? " Come on , that 's just - Hey , hey . Hey . Huh ? Do it ! Wait . Now listen . Grant , are you in there ? Skip to the end . Hurry up ! Just skip to the end ! Skip to the end . There . Quick ! - Read it ! - Okay , okay . Uh ... - " Item 417 : Catherine West ... " - Come on ! All right ! Let him go , Grant ! Why should I ? Go on , Neil . Read the last item . " Item 417 : Catherine West be madly in love with Colonel Grant ... " " and leap on him , like a tigress begging for sex . " You bastard ! Now wave your hand . Come on ! - Neil , don 't ! - Or the dog gets it ! - Don 't let him shoot me , Neil ! - Wave your goddam hand ! I don 't want to love him , Neil ! I don 't want to be NEAR him ! I don 't wanna die ! Grant . I love you . Please , let 's have sex now ! - Dennis : be free ! - I 'm free , I 'm free ! Please . - Grant , become a Corgi ! - Oh shit . Do me . Do me , Grant . Me : be free . Yes ! Yes ! Master , you chose to save me instead of that bitch ! Yeah , don 't call her that . Let Catherine be her normal self and not in love with Grant . And all Grant 's wishes be cancelled . - Ray ! - Shit , no . Get off me ! - Lord , show us how to conquer death ! Dorothy Pringle : think about Ray as you used to ! - What the hell , Ray ? - Nothing to do with me ! Get lost , you creep ! Everyone else : forget about Ray ! Thanks , Neil . Thanks a whole bunch ! - Ray , can you take me home ? - Sure . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Any thoughts ? Pathetic ! He has no concept of good or evil . Well the dogs seem alright . Yes , it 's the people I can 't stand . Oh , hey . Catherine , hi . Sorry about the other night . It was ... - ... can I cook you supper ? - No thanks , Neil . - I 'm doing a suckling pig . - No . What 's the matter ? Is it because I made you - throw yourself at Grant ? - No . You did what you had to do . It worked . Forgotten . So what is it ? Do you know what it 's like to be in someone else 's power ? To have no free will ? I thought I made you love me . - What ? - Yeah , with my powers . Oh my god . Did you make me come home early ? Have I always lived opposite you , or did you rearrange things ? - I 'll never know . - I love you . How can any woman love a man who can make her do whatever he wants , any second , every day , forever ? Sorry , Neil , I could never love you . Not in a million years . Catherine ! Sharon , terrible news ! This is indeed grave news . It seems the salubrious Gat has been interfering with our translation devices . What 's he done , Sharon ? I 'm afraid , Janet , we 've been calling ourselves by foolish Earthling names . Female ones , at that . It seems ' Sharon ' is particularly favoured by female Earthlings from ... Australia . - The shame of it ! - Sharon ... what should we be calling you ? Call me the death-dealing darkness bringer ! Yes , O death dealer ! - Great waffles , master . - Who cares about waffles ? Catherine hates me ! Ray hates me ! Everybody hates me ! I don 't hate you . And I care about waffles . I like them even more than biscuits . Even red biscuits ! You know the worst thing , Dennis ? It 's all my fault . I was just thinking about myself . What I could get . With these powers I could have solved every problem in the world . - I could have made people happy . - Not Catherine . I wanted her to love me . I was being selfish . Take world hunger , you know ? Let everyone in the world have all the food they want . Take homelessness . Let everyone in the world have a place to live . No , live in their dream house . And war . Senseless war . Over , for ever . Let there be no reason for anyone to make war anymore . Oh , and reverse global warming . Has it happened ? The latest nation to succumb to the sudden , mysterious exponential growth in the world 's food supplies is China , where the average weight is now 300 lbs and rising . While today , a party of picnicking schoolchildren brought down a mile-long section of the Great Wall of China . As homelessness becomes a thing of the past , the last undeveloped area of the Sahara Desert has become a gated community called Beau Geste Towers . Propery developers are now converging on Antarctica . At least I got rid of war . This was a good one : " Let there be no good reason to make war on anyone anymore . " How could that go wrong ? For no reason at all , New Zealand has declared war on Iceland . Barbados has declared war on Somalia . And in a surprise move the tiny island of Saint Kitts and Nevis has declared war on the entire rest of the world . Our war correspondent says he 's unavailable for comment because he 's too busy covering all the other wars that have just broken out for no reason at all . Recently , scientists feared constantly rising global temperatures . - None of them can explain ... - My god ! - Global warming ! - Not only a return to the last ice age , but to a snowball Earth from half a billion years ago . On the other hand , plans to turn the Antarctic into the Captain Scott gated community - have been put on hold . - Shit , shit , shit ! It 's not that easy trying to do good , is it . Yeah , but this is just unfair . Let everything go back to how it was before I tried to make everything better for everyone . Beautiful though the earth looks from space , we all know how fragile it is ; how much damage humans have done , and will , it seems , continue to do . Absolute power doesn 't corrupt , it drives you bloody mad ! Tell Catherine I love her . Don 't do it , master . I love you ! I 've made arrangements for your biscuits . You 'll never have to worry about them again ! - You are the kindest master . - Shush , okay ? I can 't concentrate . Master , don 't you love me ? I can 't stand it , Dennis . I can 't stand the responsibility . Get that into your stupid dog brain ! I 'll save you , master ! Here I come ! Oh , wait a second . I can 't swim . Master , help ! Help ! There you are . Thank you master . - You do love me , master . - Of course I love you , Dennis . I just don 't love myself . Time 's up . Prime the destruction generator ! Hang on , we need to see if he passed the test . He started all those wars . - That was good . - But then he stopped them . But why ? He said he was trying to make things better for people . That 's very appalling ! The only good is to destroy . The only evil is weakness . Weakness must be annihalated ! Agreed . Vaporize the Earthling and his wretched planet . I told you so . Re-prime the destruction generator . Try again , Neil . Go on . She won 't have me . - So give up the powers . - I can 't ! Then give them to me ! You won 't have them , but you 'll know where they are . And being a dog , all I want is to follow orders . I 'll do what you tell me to . - Dennis , you 're a genius ! - Not bad , huh ? Destruction generator charged , O death-dealing darkness bringer . [ Alien language . ] Commencing destruction . [ Alien language . ] It is a curse our numbers take so long to pronounce . Just wave your hand , like that . I 'm feeling it . Wow ! Yeah , there you go . What will it be ? Biscuits ? - But the power made you unhappy . - I don 't have it anymore . Look . Tree : become Eiffel Tower . See ? What are you thinking , Dennis ? [ Alien language . ] - Forgive me , master . - What are you going to do ? That 's the only short number . Let the source of the power be destroyed . Forever . [ Alien language . ] Let all this marking be finished and neatly stacked . Fiona Blackwell , go away . Fiona ! Lovely to see you ! Great news , I got my sight back ! Hey , I think I hear Catherine . - Catherine ! - Hi . Let the letters become cucumbers . Let us be on the prow of the Titanic . I got rid of the powers . I 'm impressed . I thought maybe we could have some dinner sometime . Yeah , maybe . What about tonight ? I 'll be down in half an hour . We 're going out to dinner ! I 'll bring back a doggie bag . I 'd better keep my mouth shut . - Change me back , Den . - I can 't . I like you as you are . - Those stubby legs . Look at you . - I 'm not a dog , I 'm a man ! Hey , nobody 's perfect . This is chewing a biscuit , boss . I 'll try to give you that now . Hold on one second . Red biscuit . Great . No ! No ! - Got it . - Licking . Licking somebody . This is like porn . Now a shagging noise . Look , there 's the red bit . - I 'm done . - Okay , that 's good . That 's enough chewing biscuits for now .

 RED DWARF - S11E04 - OFFICER RIMMER In memory of J.H.S. SAS MBE - Now there was a lad . Oh , Inga . Inga ! Inga ! Bud , wake up ! Huhm ? Who 's Inga ? Just someone I met at a party thrown by a giraffe called Gerald . She wanted me to fly with her to Paris , but she had a wooden head and was afraid of forks . There 's no future in it . According to Freud 's lexicon of dream symbols , flying is supposed to be a metaphor for sex . Absolute poppycock . I dream of flying all the time ! It 's certainly nothing to do with sex . It 's always the same dream . I 'm in a Boeing 727 that can 't take off . I 'm sitting there with a tiny bag of nuts I can 't get open . Then suddenly , after one giant tug , and much to my embarrassment , the whole bag explodes over premium economy . Now tell me - because I don 't see it - how on Earth is that anything to do with sex ? Sirs , I 'm picking up something from the other side of that asteroid field . It 's a deep-space explorer ship , and it 's in BIG trouble ! Getting anything ' ? The signal 's weak . The magnetite in the asteroids is distorting everything in the local vicinity . Try dropping frequencies . See if we can circumnavigate the storm . Try dropping frequencies ? See if we can circumnavigate the storm ? What are you talking about ? ! Ah . It worked , Sir ! Good call . Ident details coming in . It 's a Space Corps deep-space scout ship gravity antimatter propulsion engine state-of-the-art tech - it 's even got one of those big captainy chairs with flip-across picnic tray . I 'd kill for one of those . You could captain your way through a space battle and have a TV dinner at the same time . Through ? Coming through now , Sir . According to their manifest , the crew total is half . Half what ? I don 't know , Sir . Hey ! Now it 's saying the total crew is one ! What the hell is going on ? Ah . Best guess : The Nautilus is bio-printing its crew ; which was fashionable in the 24th century , where unmanned ships were sent into space and only after they encountered a point of interest , need , or danger were the crew best suited for the mission printed from the bio library . These dudes are going to be human , right ? Human-like . They 're created from synthetic stem cells . But like many movie stars , they 'll be incapable of having children in the normal way . Also , their lifespan will only last the length of their mission . In this case , save the Nautilus . Okay , okay . We 've got pictures coming through . This is Captain Edwin Herring of the SS Nautilus . Can you read me , over ? Copy , Nautilus . But there 's something wrong with our video feed . From our end , you look like a hideous 19th century circus freak . Bud ! You look like you 're wearing a toupee made of face ! Yeah - one look at you and even the Elephant Man would want to jump in his mum and dad 's bed ! Our bio-printer jammed . It 's faulty . My face has been printed on the top of my head . Any advice ? Yeah . Don 't wear a hat ! What 's my situation ? Obviously , it 's difficult to see . It appears Sir , your engines are burnt out . And you 're drifting into the heart of a Class C asteroid storm . I 'm carrying veranium . If the storm penetrates my hull I 'm done for , and so is everything in the local vicinity . Can you help ? Our two ships are separated by the asteroid storm . We 'll never get 'round it in time . Are you sure ? Of course we 're sure . It 's as plain as the nose on your head . What about your escape pods ? Maybe use one of those ? Too late . They 've escaped . That 's what happens when we put machines on artificial intelligence - They just look after number one . Perhaps you should print some more of your crew , Sir . Get assistance . I 've just told you my bio-printer 's faulty , you cretin ! My visuals are down - What 's your name crewman ! ? Dave Lister , Sir . Don 't speak again Lister . Understand ? Yes , Sir . I 'm done for , aren 't I ? Sirs , intel coming in . It 's much as I figured . The nearer the Nautilus gets to us , the more we , ourselves , are in danger . How 'd you make that one out ? If the Nautilus is destroyed in its present position , we 're safe . But when the Nautilus enters the asteroid storm , The veranium goes up and the blast radius nukes us , too . We 've only got one option . He just launched a mining torpedo at him ! It 's too late to intercept ! Rimmer , what have you done ? ! I 've just saved all our necks . That 's what I 've done . It was the only option . Impact one minute and counting . You 've got to tell him . You 've got to tell Herring what you 've done ! What ? Tell him I 've just nuked his ship ? I 'm not telling him that . Why not ? ! He won 't like me . I 've been hit ! I 'm spinning out ! That was the most insanely , brilliant , ballsiest tactical maneuver I 've ever witnessed ! Who fired that missile ? ! Me , Sir . Arnold J. Rimmer . You mean you took off my wing knowing it would knock me out of the asteroid storm ? That 's genius , Rimmer ! They don 't call me " Old Iron Balls " for nothing , Sir . I owe you my life , man ! What 's your rank ? Second Tech , Sir . Not any longer . I 'm promoting you to officer , Rimmer ! I 'll send the authorization through now . I look forward to meeting you . We 'll head back to Red Dwarf Sir , and then pick you up . Officer Rimmer . After all these years ! Oh , yes ! You are genuine , pedigree , thoroughbred scum , aren 't you Rimmer . That 's Officer Rimmer to you , Private Nothing ! To do : Ramscoop MOT We 're just eight hours from Captain Herring 's ship , Sir . I also have the paperwork confirming your promotion . According to Protocol 712 , there 'll need to be an accolade so that you can be officially accredited as an officer . Mmmm , Simple affair , Kryten . I don 't want anything too special . We 'll have it in the Hall of Heroes . Champagne , canapes . Maybe a very quick six-guns salute . Let 's not get carried away . And then perhaps a short tribute - to me . No more than an hour . And then I 'll outline my plans to open a new officers ' club on D deck . A new officers ' club , Sir ? Somewhere with an atmosphere of understated luxury where officers can unwind in their precious hours away from the grind of command . Oh . So basically , Sir , you 're instigating a class system . The " haves " me , The " have-nots " you lot . One question , Sir . The fact that you 've been awarded officer-hood by an act of gross deception - does that in any way take the sheen off it ? Not really . No . It 's about getting there , Kryten . Not how you get there . I made love to a beautiful woman in her apartment last night . That 's important . How did you get there , bike or bus - Not important . Zero G Sports . Where is it ? We were up to match day 4 . Where is it gone ? ! Zero G Sports is an officer only channel ? ! Has Rimmer been smegging around with our TV package ? ! We 've only got the lame stations ! Look at it : 24 Hour Knitting channel ? ! The Hat channel ? ! Amish MTV ! We haven 't got the totally , unnecessarily massive , repeat sports package anymore ! Look at this ! Seven ID Seven , Premier League Croquet Eastbourne Ladies vs Gloucester Girls . It 's a grudge match ! Gosh ! It 's not too bad . Hot dog ? Attention , attention . Officer Rimmer here . We 'll shortly be approaching SS Nautilus to welcome Captain Herring . Would all lower orders please make their way to B deck . What the smeg 's this ? ! Why has the old service lift been turned to the grunts lift ? So the rank and file can travel between floors with their own kind . Meantime , you use the officers ' lift which we can 't use on account of the fact that we 're not " officery . " It 's one of the privileges of rank , Third Technician . Gentlemen , I bid you a temporary farewell . A towel , Sir . Ah , thank you . Facial mist for you , Sir . Lovely . Complimentary executive beverage for you , Sir . Most kind . That 'll be all . Go along . Floor ? Floor ? I said " floor . " Landing Bay , please . What ? Landing Bay ! Okay , keep your ' air on , I 'm not deaf , am I ? Has he interfered with the lift some how and made it ruder ? Have a wonderful onward journey . And we look forward to going down with you again soon . How enchanting . How hot was that lift ? My diodes are almost cooked ! Hey , look at my hair ! I 've lost volume , height , bounce ! No way am I putting up with this . A problem , Private Zero ? Rimmer , if you think for one minute ... Officers ' Corridor ? What 's this ? ! Well Sir , the scutters referbed the old tube tunnel . See you at the end of the corridor . Bon voyage ! His corridor has got the best of everything ! Air con , music ? Look ! He doesn 't even have to walk ! Welcome aboard , Captain Herring . That 's a hell of a ceiling you 've got , Rimmer . The lattice work 's stunning ! You 're most kind , Sir . Not massively important , but this is our crew : Cat . Ah . Kryten . Uh-huh . And Third Technician , Lister . Ahhh . Is this Lister ? Ha-ha . I can tell he 's no good just by feeling him . I 'm on to you , Lister . Don 't think I 'm not . Which reminds me , Rimmer , I might have been a bit hasty promoting you to officer . I should have promoted you to first lieutenant . And I have ! Congratulations ! Thank you so much , Sir . What 's the situation with the Nautilus , Flight Lieutenant ? Oh , that 's me . Uhm , the scutters are unloading your cargo , Sir . The ship 's done for , I 'm afraid . Well , the cargo 's safe at least . That means my mission 's up . How are we going to get him demoted now ? How , indeed . Huhm . Yes , elegant . Stylish . This 'll suit me and my fellow officers down to the ground , Kryten . How are you coming along with the bio-printer ? Ah . I 've repaired it , Sir . So soon ? How ? I gave it a good kicking ! I thought you didn 't believe in hitting machines . Oh , photocopies and printers are an exception , Sir . We 're just waiting for it to calibrate . Good . And then we can start to bio-print the Nautilus ' crew ? Indeed . Excellent . I want to print out all those who ranked below me , regardless of job or profession . Shouldn 't we speak to Mr. Lister , Sir ? Kryten , bio-printing is an officer-only privilege . Decisions of this magnitude can 't be left to a lowly technician . Uh , Sir . Are you familiar with the Abraham Lincoln quotation on power ? Lincoln the president ? He got assassinated at the theater . Indeed . I 've never been a fan of the theater , Kryten . My mother used to take me and some of the most excruciating hours of my life have been spent there . Sometimes the greater tragedy is going to the theater and NOT getting shot . You were saying . Lincoln once said , If you want to test a man 's character , give him power . And Officer Rimmer once said if you want to feel my boot up your recharge socket , keep talking . So we can print out any of these people ? Yeah . What about her ? A fitness ball lady in tight Lycra shorts . She can 't demote anybody . So what if she can 't ? I can see past that ! Sirs ! No ! Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait ! Go back ! Go back ! Go back ! That 's you ! That 's me ! How is that me ? ! Your genome is in the Nautilus ' database ? D-what ? How ? ! Ah . Ha . Ah . Ha . I think I might have flogged it . You flogged your genome ? ! Yeah , I was a kid and my mate , Dodgy offered me 100 dollar pounds and a half a packet of fags for it . All you have to do is put some saliva on a stick . You sold the rights to your unique haploid set of chromosomes , Sir ? You traded away the map categorizing every detail of your genetic make up for 100 dollar pounds and half a packet of fags ? ! You think he should have held out for a whole pack ? Sir , this means someone else holds the copyright to you . You don 't own yourself ! What , like every time I take a leak , I 'm handling stolen goods ? Look , we 're 3 million years into the big black . No one 's coming out here . Who cares ? ! Exactly . We 're coooool ! Sir , I don 't think you appreciate what you 've done ! Thousands of different companies have taken out a license to produce yous . You 're like writing software that people can buy , and then use as they like . What , and do what they want with ? Here 's one . License 10 years . 3,000 Listers - Sandex Communication Listers , to be used in call centers . Do you mean all those smart-ass scousers in the call centers are me ? ! I 've had those Johnnies - They 're a pain in the backside ! They know nothing and they sound like they don 't want to be there . They don 't , Sir . They 're you ! What have you done , Bud ? ! So Rimmer is going to use this machine to produce people who will obey him . Never being born has got to be better than a life like that . We 've got to wipe the database , Kryten . Delete it all . Right now . I can 't , Sir . I have to print out a new crew as instructed . Now Mr. Rimmer 's our flight lieutenant , I can 't refuse his orders ! Well I 'll do it . Just tell me what to do ! Sir ! If you think I 'm going to select all these files and then take my leave , taking my leave , so you can press that button there , you 've got another think coming ! The entire database has deleted itself ? ! Check bio-printer . This is going down on my daily to-do list . How ? It 's a mystery , Sir . I bet Lister 's behind this . Isn 't it possible to print anyone ? I need a crew to command ! Well , in theory it is possible to insert a piece of DNA into the bio-printer and have it produce a genome , but who would we print ? ! My mind 's on file in the holosuite , And my DNAs on all my old belongings . With the remaining bio-ink , we could produce 50 versions of me . Make them all officers , so as flight lieutenant I 'm over them , and then , we can have an officers ' club crammed full of Rimmers ! Sir , history tells us that you and you is a very bad mix . You and 50 yous is beyond horrific ! Not if I 'm their commanding officer . Then they 'll do what I want . Move the bio-printer to one of the junk rooms and double security ! Things are about to get a whole lot more Rimmery ! You what ? Officers ' Club ? Evening . Evening . Evening . Evening . Evening Evening . Where they come from ? He 's bio-printing Rimmers ! We 've got to kill that damn machine before he prints any more ! Ah , gentlemen - welcome . Do you have a reservation ? Where 's the bio-printer , Rimmer ? Is it here , 'cause we 're going in . I 'm afraid I can 't let you in unless you 're on the list . Let me see . Stop screwing ' around , Rimmer . Have you moved the bio-printer to somewhere in the Officers ' Club ? Sorry . You don 't appear to be here . Rimmer . Party of two . Eight thirty PM . Come in . How lovely to see you again ! Nice to see you . How many did he print ! ? Rimmer party . Four ? Straight through . Cloakroom 's on the left . Enjoy ! How many have you printed , you Smeghead ? ! You can 't use bio ink to print more Rims , Rimmer . Yeah . We need that ink to print proper people ! Hey , what the hell is this ? ! We 're the Barbershop Quartet ! Any ID ? Mr. Rimmer , We are what we seem , The cutest quartet that you 've ever seen . We 've got four mouths , a duet times two , this barbershop quartet is singing for you ! That , is entertainment . In ya go . I 've had enough of this tossing about . Come on , we 're going in . I 've got the cravat ! Hey ! Hey . Ah . Hot towel , Sir ? Move ! Facial spray ? Enough ! They 've barged their way into the Officers ' Club and I need some bouncers . Print four more mes and make them huge , muscly and brave . Can the bio-printer do that ? In theory , Sir . Complimentary Executive Corridor beverage , Sir ? Don 't start ! Adjustments made , Sir . Why isn 't it printing ? Well , the new settings need extra time to calibrate , Sir . We 'll just have to be a little bit patient . I have been patient ! What 's wrong with it - the damn thing ! Come on ! Come on , come on , come on ! Last . The first one 's got stuck . We need a midwife ! We 'll have to do it ourselves ! Pull , Kryten ! Pull me . Pull ! What the hell is that thing ? ! Come on ! Officer 's lift on floor 15 , Sir ! We 've got to take the grunts ! Get me out of here , pronto ! I 'm busy , okay ? Just close the doors ! There 's a deranged version of me out there ! There 's one in here , too . I 'll take the stairs , Sir . We 've got to tell the others ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry ! Just close the doors , please ! Hold the lift ! Don 't close ! Wait for me ! Officers ' Quarters now ! Okay , keep your ' air on I 'm not deaf , am I ? Right ! I 've rigged up a monitor wirelessly from the CCTV footage . From this , we can see where the Rimmer monster is and what it 's doing . It 's coming to the officers ' deck ! Let me in ! Are you on the list ? If you 're name 's not down , you can 't come in . Riffraff only . I 'm going to get absorbed ! You 're going to have to admit you 're a grunt . Total grunt . Your going to have to resign your first lieutenant-ship . But I worked so hard for it ! You did nothing ! But I did it so well ! Okay , okay ! I resign ! Just let me in ! Stand back , Technician 2.0 What is that thing ? The human body is built of cells . with specific fixed rolls , Sir . Stem cells , on the other hand can become any other type of cell . What , reprogrammable ? So when the printer jammed and did a mash-up of all the countless Rimmers , it didn 't just combine the sum of your parts physically , it amalgamated all your faults . I 've got faults ? Your lust for power , your impatience , your insecurity , your stupidity , your greed , your arrogance , Yes - thank you , Kryten . and ordered these stem cells to make a creature to accommodate them all . So how do we kill it ? I have an idea , Sir . But it does involve using you as bait . I love it already ! We 'll have to go the long way around ! We can 't shoot ! We might take out Mr. Rimmer ! And the downside of that is ... ? Hey ! What are you doing ? We are going to absorb the final Rimmer . Oh aye . Then what you going to do ? We haven 't decided yet . What ? Do you not make a to-do list ? We need to make a to-do list ? You should always make a to-do list ! Have you got a pen ? We always have a pen . Well then , write that list . Oh , and don 't forget to put the last thing you 're going to be doing on that list . What 's that ? Dying ! Thank you , Leo , for clarifying the lift 's dialog !

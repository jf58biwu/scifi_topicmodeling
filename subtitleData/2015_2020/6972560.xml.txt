 I love that color on her . It looks really good . - Excuse me . - Okay . Oh , sorry . Yeah . - We talked about it . - Honey , just have a seat . All right . Thank you , dear . I 'll be ... I 'll be right back . Okay ? Okay , but , like , Teagan needs it this big . How are you holding up ? Shaky . You gonna do the toast ? I don 't know . I 'm getting some serious glare and stare action . Mm . Tell me about it . One of the groomsmen hit on me . And the drunk uncle asked if I still had a penis . Well , at least we live in one of the most progressive cities in the world . I know . I think it might be time for me to get a headache - and bow out like the coward I am . - Mm-hmm . - CBM incoming . - Oh , God . - Michael . - Janet . I don 't want to make a scene here . Why not ? I have some great ideas . I know Teagan asked you to speak , but if you have any compassion for your sister or this family , I really think it would be best for everyone if you had one of your mysterious headaches and left early . Just consider it . Please . Well ... you gotta do it now . Is this working ? My name is Nomi . I am Teagan 's only sibling , which means , yes , I am her former brother-now-sister . This may come as a surprise to some of you . I 'm a subject my parents prefer to avoid . Hi , Mom . Hi , Dad . As someone not usually invited to these family functions , I admit that , for a long time , I related the idea of family to Nietzsche 's " That which does not kill you makes you stronger . " But I don 't think that way about family anymore . And that 's largely due to my sister Teagan . So , let me tell you a little bit about her . Dirt ! We want the dirt ! Everybody thinks Teagan is really nice , but it 's not true . She isn 't nice . She 's super nice . Like , sickeningly nice . She was born a vegetarian . I remember her apologizing before eating french fries because they were related to Mr. Potato Head . And , yes , she did go to Greece to help Syrian refugees . It was hard being Teagan 's sibling ... because she was so perfect . She was smart , and funny , and pretty . Bluebirds followed her to school . I , on the other hand , was the opposite . I was the difficult one . I was troubled . I remember an early therapy session with my mother where we were just screaming at each other until she blurted out , " Why can 't you be more like Teagan ? " Be careful what you wish for , Mom . Teagan and I got into huge fights , too . I know I was trying to provoke her . I once tore up her diary . I wanted her to get angry , to feel depressed , to have a fit . To be more like me . The worst fight we ever had was just before my operation . She came to my apartment . I think , like most cisgendered people , she didn 't understand why I had to have surgery . She was scared for me . I think a small part of her wanted to talk me out of it . And then she found out I had forged my mother 's signature on the medical consent forms ... and we both realized she now had the power to stop me . I got scared . I said some pretty terrible things that I regretted as soon as I said them . She left and I wondered if that was it , if our relationship was over . The night before I went into the hospital was the longest and the loneliest I 've ever felt in my life . But no one stopped me . When I woke up ... the first thing I felt was Teagan 's hand holding mine . Her smile was the first thing I saw . And her voice singing " Happy Birthday " was the first thing I heard . It was in that moment ... my sister taught me what " family " actually means . So , Tom ... treat my sister well , because if you don 't ... - I swear I ... - will find you . To Teagan . The best sister anyone could hope for . I love you . And I wish you and Tom all the best . I would totally wear this if it came in my size . I can 't believe she 's already having her third child . It 's wonderful . And she 's a year younger than you , Kala . Why did she bother going to university if all she was going to do was make babies ? - Kala . - What ? She was one of the top students . It 's a complete waste of resource for a mind like her . She shouldn 't be at home ... changing diapers . She should be solving , like , global warming . - Such a way of thinking you have . - Am I wrong ? She 's your friend . She 's discovering her life the same as you are . And she looks happy when I see her . Of course she 's happy . She has a husband she loves . And both of them together are making a family , which is the most natural thing in the world . I 'm not saying it 's not natural . Though , let us remember that cancer is also natural , so naturalness in itself should not be considered a virtue . I 'm just suggesting that there are better uses for a mind like hers . Well , let 's wait and see what you think once you and Rajan start having children . I need a coffee . I 'll meet you outside . Fuck . Great . I just pissed myself . Sorry . Fuck , man . I 've been looking all over this fucking city for you . I needed to lay low . - I figured it was bad . - Why ? I 'm not the only one looking . - Cops ? - Mm-hmm . Fuchs ? Yeah . Keeps calling , like ... one of your old girlfriends . What happened ? - It 's not good . - Gah ! When you say " not good , " usually means stuff 's going to start blowing up and people will start dying . Maybe it 's time for me to leave this town . India plan . Maybe . Is everything all right between you and Rajan ? Why would you ask that ? Because you 're my daughter . Rajan and I are ... We 're not exactly ... Well , there are things that we did not know about each other that we are ... processing . You know , Bitta ... when your father first brought me to Bombay ... I was terrified of these streets . I remember the first time I went out , I got lost . It was so different from where I grew up . So busy and noisy . Nobody knew anybody . I thought I wouldn 't be safe and comfortable here . One day , he asked me to get a few things for his restaurant , and I couldn 't do it . I had to pay a boy to get them for me . I hid in the doorway and waited for them . I didn 't tell this to your dad . I was too ashamed . You know , Kala , sometimes ... all we need is ... a bit of time . No . No . No . No . Wait . That 's her . - You sure ? - Yeah . We found her . Her name is Carol Cumberland . She was here . Angelica ? With Whispers . Did you say " Whispers " ? We 're heading into some creepy house and you 're talking about some guy named Whispers ? Seriously ? He can wait in the car if he wants . I know he 's probably saying some shit like I can wait in the car , but I 'm a cop . I was just shining a light upon a situation that normal people in their normal lives prefer to avoid . No one 's home . Which means Officer Gorski 's probably suggesting ... Let 's go around back . Yeah . Predictable . What have you gotten me into ? I don 't want to hurt you . But I will if you don 't answer my questions . Mm-hmm . Little B and E. Sure . Why not ? We 're just officers of the law , right ? Angel and Raoul . Slow down . It 's okay . Raoul , you can do it . I got you . It 's just some stairs . They went down there . Hold on , hold on . Hey ... I got this . - I got him . - This way . Go through here . Come on . I got you . Yeah , great . I 'll let you do your séance thing . I 'll stay back here . They can make us normal ... She was searching for her children . So much pain . The research might be helpful . They want to sterilize us . Everything all right ? Hey , what are you doing ? It 's okay . You 'll be safe . I 'm sorry . Forgive me . Forgive me . I 'm so sorry . That 's fucking creepy . So to recap , we got your standard mad scientist lab . Apparently abandoned . Still looking for evidence of a crime . We should look upstairs . Right . Let me guess , his idea . Fuck . I know I 'm going to win . I can smell my victory . Oh , no . - Oh . - Ha ! Four in a row . I win again . Van Damn ! It 's good to see you , Amondi . Give us a moment , Amondi . Go with Martha . - You still have homework to do , huh ? - See you later . See you . If you do become president , will you stop driving the Van Damn ? Never . Come . What can I do for you , Van Damn ? I want to know why your men have been following me . Can I offer you a drink ? - Oh . No , thank you . - I 'll have a bourbon . I should have told you about my men , but I knew if I did , you would have said you didn 't want them . I don 't . Your friends at the KDRP may know something about politics , but I know Nairobi . The true measure of a candidate 's viability in this city is not measured by polls or numbers . You know that someone is a serious contender by the size of the bounty . There 's a bounty on my head ? There 's a bounty on anyone who runs against Mandiba . How serious is it ? I would say now the price is somewhere between a beating and a kidnapping . But let 's see what happens after your rally . This will tell us how dangerous they think you are . Are you telling me you think I should withdraw ? Withdraw now and you will have done the exact opposite of what you set out to do . Instead of undermining Mandiba 's hold over this city and his control of Kibera , your withdrawal will serve to make him invincible . Then I can 't withdraw . No . And I can 't claim to be like everyone else if I have armed guards following me everywhere I go . You are right to understand that politics requires courage . But if you 're asking for advice , I would suggest you stop driving a bus where every day , you arrive at the same appointed time . Will you answer a question honestly ? As honestly as I can . Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba 's control over this city is good for your business interests ? The easiest decisions in this world are those where what is good for business is also good for your family . F ... Family ? You know I 'm deeply indebted . And you know my daughter cares very much about you . But I must admit , I would never make such a presumption based on this alone . You asked for honesty . I 'm in love with your mother . And it is my intention to ask her to marry me . We made it . I think we made it . I think we made it . Oh , God . Who starts a wedding on the dot ? My mother . - Good luck . - Okay . Okay . Come on . Ah ! She 's here ! Oh , my God , T ! Oh ! Oh , my God . You look so beautiful . Thank you . By the way , Bug , I have to say that is an amazing tux . eBay . Worn by the actual stunt double for Bond , James Bond . From Russia With Love . That 's a nice rack for a dude . - Did he say what I think he said ? - Uh-huh . Do you want me to hurt him ? Normally , yes , of course . But today is T 's big day and I have to be careful because I can 't be responsible for anything going wrong . I read people talk to themselves when they know no one cares what they have to say . Do you think that 's true ? Maybe just a little . He 's too late . Elaine ! - I 'm not leaving this room . - I know . I know . It 's okay . I understand what you 're going through . And I 'm not judging , or trying to fix it , or tell you what to do . I just wanted you to know that I love you . And that you aren 't alone . Oh , my God . Lito , you have to get up , right now ! If you don 't do it ... No , I 'm gonna make you do it , because it 's so freaking perfect . It 's you and Hernando . It ... - It 's meant for you . - What are you talking about ? I stayed up all night . And I read all the scripts . I was about to give up , but ... I found it . I found the one . Many of us spend our lives searching for the one . For Teagan and Tom , the search has come to an end . Marriage is a sacred union . It is a rite uniting individuals into a family . - It bonds two minds . - I always cry at weddings . - It bonds two hearts and souls . - Me , too . You came here today before us as two . You will leave as one . - Are you ready ? - Yes . Teagan Marks , do you take this man to be your husband , to love and to cherish , to have and ... Excuse me ! I 'm really sorry about this . I wish I didn 't have to do this , but I don 't have a choice . Special Agent Bendix , FBI . - I 'm going to ask all of you ... - You motherfucker . to remain in your seats until we have secured the individual in question . Now hold on a second ... What right do you have to come into my church ? I am Special Agent Bendix . I 'm here to arrest Nomi Marks . - Nom ? - I don 't understand . - You said it was fine . - I thought it was . Oh , God . Oh , God . What the hell , Bug ? You said it worked . It did work . You saw it worked . I knew this . I knew this was going to happen . Mom , Dad , do something . It 's your own fault . I told you not to include him . No . I won 't let you . If you want to finish your sacred rite , get out of the way . Otherwise , I can take you downtown , too . - Teagan , be reasonable . - But ... We knew this could happen . We warned you . Michael is a disaster . He ruins everything ! Janet , calm down ! There are police officers swarming my daughter 's wedding , as if I have not endured enough humiliation because of ... Mom ! Go ahead . Take his side . Even when he destroys your wedding . Please , don 't make it any worse . Go with these men and we 'll see if anything can be done for you later . I 'm sorry , T. I 'm so sorry . This is what happens when you think you can outsmart the law . Turn around . Hands behind your back . Stop ! Stop ! - Get your damn hands off her ! - Oh , yeah . Go ahead , obstruct . Get ready to arrest Miss Caplan , too . - Come on . - Amanita , it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's not . This isn 't your fault . It 's this moron ! He 's had his head so far up his ass , he didn 't bother to check . Check what ? Good citizens of San Francisco 's upper tax bracket , this man , Agent Jeffrey Bendix , has stormed into the middle of this sacred ceremony , violating this important moment for absolutely no other reason than the gratification of his male ego ! Bullshit . I urge you to contact your congressperson ... I 'm a congressperson ! Nomi Marks is one of the most wanted fugitives in this city . Prove it ! Show us the warrant , Agent Bendix . I have the arrest warrant right here . He doesn 't have a warrant . Of course I have one . Dad ? - Agent Bendix ... - Nomi Marks is wanted by at least three different agencies in the federal system . I trust that you are familiar with the law firm Winslow , Wise , Allegretti Marks ? I sincerely hope that you 're going to show me the warrant . What did you do ? She did something ! She did some kind of hacking ! This is bullshit ! Take your hands off my daughter ... or I promise you , I will pursue a suit seeking the kind of damages that end the careers of men like you . Whoo ! Boo ! Pull yourself together . Apologies for the , uh , theatrical misunderstanding . Minister , if you please . Thank you . Are you all right ? He 's never called me " daughter . " - I love you . - I love you , too . Yes ! You good ? We 're good . Teagan Marks , do you take this man to be your husband ? It 's pretty good . " Pretty good " ? Lito , you 're crying snot . Okay , it 's brilliant . It is . It is . It so is . It 's perfect for you . You are Jordi Gallo . Dani , this is a Hollywood film . I 'm sure right now they are meeting with Javier Bardem or Gael García to play Jordi . Oh , yeah . Javier 's amazing . You see ? Even the love of my life thinks there are better choices . No . It is meant for you . I mean , this scene where Jordi proposes to Pablo at the funeral , it 's ... This is an incredible scene . I can hear your voice , I can see you as Jordi Gallo . All we have to do is get you in the room with these people , and they will see it , too . Dani , please , stop torturing me . I 'm not torturing you . I believe in you . I don 't even have an agent who can call and get me in this imaginary room . I didn 't have an agent at the beginning of my career . I didn 't let that stop me . Hernando , please . Dani , I think Lito needs a little bit of time . - Fifty-eight minutes . - It 's not about 58 minutes . Just give me 58 minutes . Can you bring a timer ? Fifty-eight minutes . Why 58 minutes ? It 's the longest it 's ever taken me . Can I borrow your phone ? What are you gonna do ? Fifty-eight ... Fifty-eight . Hi , this is Daniela Velázquez of the Velázquez Agency in Mexico City . A little bird told me Kit Wrangler is casting Iberian Dreams and I have incredible news for him . Yes . Mm-hmm . That 's right . - Kit Wrangler ? - I 'll hold . You think you 're gonna just call up and get me a meeting with Kit Wrangler ? Who is Kit Wrangler ? Academy Award-winning producer . Yes , of course Mr. Wrangler 's in a meeting . I mean , " Daniela who ? What , Mexico ? Where ? " The thing is ... to whom am I speaking , by the way ? Jean-Baptiste . Look , Jean-Baptiste , I need you to indulge this Mexican madwoman for two minutes . Just two minutes , because every career , every successful Hollywood story can be reduced to a single moment , to one break where someone recognized an opportunity that no one else did . These next two minutes , Jean-Baptiste , could be the difference between where you are right now and the first associate producer credit of your career . I want you to go online , click YouTube , type in " Lito Rodriguez , São Paulo Pride . " I want you to watch the speech , and then I want you to look at the number of views . And if you can see what I see , you will call me be back . This is never gonna work . - Hi , is Chip in ? Yeah , it 's Dani . - Chip ? Who 's Chip ? - Sleazebag at Variety . - Chip ! Oh , really ? You saw me in the video ? God , it was insane ! But that was nothing compared to what happened afterwards . You naughty thing , you ! Do you kiss your mother with that mouth ? Oh , shit ! One sec . One sec . Jean-Baptiste . I can 't believe this . I am talking to Peter Cohen on the other line . Yeah , it 's for ... Ladies of the Canyon . I know . I know , it 's so not Iberian Dreams . But Peter 's genius is sensing when an actor 's having a moment . Hold on , hold on . He 's not gonna do it for less than two million . Oh , really ? We 'll see what you think after Ellen . That 's right . She loves an LGBT story . Call me back . Oh , my God , you heard that ? I thought I muted this thing . Chip , holy shit , that was Lito . We 'll be in LA this week . Why ? Well , no , I 'm not really supposed to say anything . Oh , but it 's so exciting . No , no , no . It 's still a secret . Promise you won 't tell anyone . Lito is meeting with Kit . I know ! It 's so good ! Please , please , promise you won 't tell anyone . Oh , you 're a doll . See you in LA . Ciao . Jean-Baptiste , I 'm so sorry . I know , it 's heartbreaking . He 's perfect . Exactly . Exactly like that , which is ... Oh , shit . That 's Peter again . I have to call you back . I know . Lito loves Iberian Dreams , but the Ladies offer is real . It 's killing me . It 's heartbreaking , but it 's timing , and this business , it 's all about timing . Okay . All right , yeah . I 'll wait ... if you think you can do something . Talk to me , Jean-Baptiste . What ? Variety called while you were with Kit ? That 's really weird synchronicity . But , hey , timing is everything , isn 't it ? Yeah . Okay , sure . Put him on . Hello , Kit . I know . I felt it , too . I believe in this project . I believe it was destiny . I can 't wait for you to meet him . I know you are going to love him . Ciao . No velvet rope , no closed doors , no VIP entrance can ever keep Daniela Velázquez ... out . Dani , that was amazing . Three first-class tickets . Offer on the table , contingent to meeting . - Dani ! Thank you . - You don 't have to thank me . What you have to do is get in that room and get this part . - I 'm Jordi Gallo . - You 're Jordi Gallo . - I 'm Jordi Gallo . - You 're Jordi Gallo ! You 're Jordi Gallo ! Pack your bags because we 're going to Hollywood ! Ohhh ! Fifty-eight ! Fifty-eight ! Fifty-eight ! Hello ? Mrs. Rasal ? There 's a man down here claiming to be a friend of the family . Kala , hi . This is Ajay . Ajay . Yes . Hello . Um , I 'm sorry , but Rajan is away . - He 's at a factory in Bangalore . - How unfortunate . Look , I was passing by your fortified sky palace because I want to drop off a gift , a better-late-than-never wedding present . Oh , um ... I know how neighbors can talk , so I 'm happy to have the ever-vigilant Mr. Security here as chaperone . Won 't take but a moment . Um ... sure . Yeah . Wow . A nice fixer-upper Raj has got himself here . Um , you really didn 't have to do this . If I can be frank , Mrs. Rasal ... I met Raj quite a bit after your wedding , and it never occurred to me , not once . But the moment I saw your reaction to the fact that I hadn 't been to your wedding , I realized the scale of my mistake . This is what they mean I think by ... the " civilizing nature of women . " - Hm ... - I mean , everyone makes mistakes . But I think it 's important to make amends when appropriate . As I said , you really didn 't have to . No , but I did . And my karma has rewarded me with another opportunity to talk to you . You believe in karma , Mrs. Rasal ? I do . Um , yes . Me , too . Me , too . Open it up with Raj if you don 't mind . It 'll just mean more that way . Yeah , sure . And once again , congratulations to you both . Thank you . Bye for now . Might I have a word with you , Mr. Secretary ? We are making great progress with the microspaces . The neuro-grafting and lateral demonstrations are yielding extraordinary results . I need a meeting with him . I 'm afraid that 's not possible right now . - When ? - I wish I could say for certain ... Mr. Secretary , remind him of one thing I am certain of . This program exists because of me . I 'll make sure he gets the message . Coroner 's report came in . Toxicology confirms what we saw . Carol Cumberland took a bunch of pills and slit her wrists . Why ? Why was Jonas there ? Are you asking me or someone else in your head ? You . Well ... that is what we call police work . Uh-oh . This is the wife . Gotta take this . Riley . You have to get back to London . I know how to get to Whispers , but we 're gonna need more blockers . How many do you have left ? Uh ... Four . - Fuck . That 's not enough . - Well , Kala believes she can make them . - We won 't have time to test them . - Are you talking to Will ? I got some pretty bad news . - What ? - What ? It 's his dad . He 's dying . Who are you ? It 's okay . She 's a friend of Will 's . I don 't care what my son did . I just want him to come home . What happened ? Shock brought on by septicemia . We think he fell . Hurt himself . I found him on the floor . On the floor ? - How long ? - Don 't know . But he 's a fighter . Who are you ? - It 's me ... - Dad . Who the fuck are you ? I want Will . I want my son . I 'm so sorry . I wish he could be here . Dad . Willie . Where are you ? Are you okay ? - I 'm okay , Dad . - You 're not okay ! There are government agents saying all kinds of fucked up shit about you . - Dad , are you drinking ? - What do you care ? - You 're not supposed to be drinking , Dad . - You 're not here ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Dad . I should be here . I should be here . I 'm so sorry . Willie . I ... I knew you 'd come . You see me , Dad ? My boy . - Come on . Fire it in . - Ready ? Come on . You can 't hurt me . Oh ! We used to play catch . Remember ? I remember . Why did we stop ? I don 't know . Go get your mitt . - You got a good arm . - Whoo ! Yeah . - Willie , I gotta go to work . - Come on , Dad ! No . Come on ! Duty calls . Dad ! No . Dad , don 't go . Please ! Dad ! Come back ! Dad . No . Come on , Dad ! Please , stay ? Dad ?

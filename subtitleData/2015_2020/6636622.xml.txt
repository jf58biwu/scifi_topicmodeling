( SPEAKING ARABIC ) ( CHUCKLES ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO IN ARABIC ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( PRAYING IN ARABIC ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( INDISTINCT INSTRUMENT BLARING ) SCULLY : What am I hearing , Mulder ? According to eyewitnesses or " earwitnesses , " as it were , it sounded like trumpets playing . From nowhere in particular ? No apparent source . Music as if from the heavens themselves , as if God himself was making music , blowing his own horn . Since when do you believe in God , Mulder ? What makes you think I do ? " God himself " ? I speak merely as an investigator . Reports from Belarus to Canada , France , Italy , Germany , the Ukraine ... But as an investigator , you seem to give this phenomenon credibility . It 's not important what I believe , Scully . It 's important what they believe . The earwitnesses . And what do they believe ? " And I saw the seven angels that stood before God , " and to them were given seven trumpets . " Revelations 8 : 2 - A herald of end times . You know that prophecies like this have been going on for centuries . Failed prognostications of doom , failed prophecy , even in the Bible . Yeah , God told Adam that if he ate the forbidden fruit he 'd die , and he lived 930 years . Top that . You know that didn 't literally happen , right ? I 'm just sayin ' . It 's your book . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) AGENT MILLER : Hello ? Anyone down here ' ? Nobody but the fbi 's Most Unwanted - I 've been waiting 23 years to say that . How 'd it feel ? Pretty good . Yeah ? It 's open . Come on in . Special Agent Fox Mulder ? Speaking . And to whom am I speaking ? I 'm Special Agent Miller . This is Special Agent Einstein . You 're Special Agent Einstein ? I claim a distant relation , if that 's what you 're referring to . MULDER : Forgive Agent Scully 's impertinence . She wrote her dissertation on Einstein 's twin paradox . Excuse me , but I was definitely told you were a medical doctor . I am . But I 'm also a scientist . Because I 'm a medical doctor . Oh . And you 're a profiler , obsessed with the paranormal ? That 's why we 're here , actually . When we should be at the airport . You both heard about the terrorist bombing of an art gallery in Texas ? Yes . Two young Muslim men protesting the depiction of Mohammed . Wearing suicide bomber vests . Can we get to the business section , please ? Nine people killed in the act but one of the bombers survived - AGENT EINSTEIN : Technically . Medically , he 's in a persistent vegetative state . He 's dead except for a heartbeat . You must imagine why we 're here . There have been so-called practitioners ... I 'm sorry . Forgive me , but I can 't imagine why you 're here . That would make two of us . Agent Miller , a man with a mind obviously open to possibility , would like to communicate with the dead , or the near-dead , ( SCOFFS ) as the case may be . I believe he may have intel on a larger sleeper cell with an aim to commit more acts of terror . Which is where our energy would be better spent , trying to stop live terrorists rather than stopping to try to speak with dead ones . I have to say I agree . There have been noted divinators , oracles , fakirs , necromancers who have claimed the ability ... Madame Blavatsky , founder of Theosophism , brought to America a so-called Ancient Wisdom gained from Tibetan spiritual adepts . Maybe I 've been part of the X-Files too long , but I happen to know that Madame Blavatsky 's dead . Which would make it that much harder Oh - to glean her far-flung abilities . Yeah . That 's what I thought . Miller ? You know of no such practitioner working now whom we might consult ? None that I 'd waste your time on . Miller , come on . There 's a 1 : 30 flight to Texas , and I want to be on it . Thank you for your time . Please call me when you think of something . He seemed like a bright young man . She calls him " Miller . " Hmm . ( ON TV ) Using artwork to desecrate the prophet of someone else 's religion just incites fanatical terrorists . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) It 's just a painting . Yeah . Of Mohammed sitting on a toilet defecating radical Islamists ! WOMAN " . Do you know how absurd this all is ? It 's just absurd ! MAN : It 's not absurd to the victims of this action and their families ... Wearing that vest , those last few steps , knowing you 're gonna die , must be so strange . How ' bout the victims ? Imagine not knowing . That 's even worse . Where does all the hate come from ? He 's just a kid . A kid needs to be taught this hate . You wonder who got in his head . Well , he 's not gonna tell you , Miller . And neither is any necromancer . Well , wasn 't it at least worth a try ? ( SCOFFS ) You think anyone takes the X-Files seriously ? That 's why they got them stuck down in that basement office . I pity that poor Agent Scully . That 's , like , my dream assignment . No self-respecting scientist would spend a career toiling away in obscure realms of science fiction . Why else would she do it ? She 's clearly in love with him . You spent all of five minutes with them . How do you know that ? Nothing else would explain it . Maybe he values her open mind . Maybe she challenges his B.S. ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) ( SIGHS ) Special Agent Miller speaking . ( ON PHONE ) Agent Miller , this is Agent Scully . Um . Hey . One second . I 'll meet you on the plane . MAN : Westboro Church is not representative of all Christians ! WOMAN : Of course not , but they have ... Hi . You might wonder why I 'm calling . AGENT MILLER : NO - Uh , well , actually , yeah . I was thinking about your case , and I have an idea that might help you communicate with your terrorist . That is good news . What is it ? There 's something I 'd like to try . But I need to meet you in Texas - . Okay . Yeah . That sounds great . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Special Agent Einstein speaking . Agent Einstein , it 's Agent Mulder . You must wonder why I 'm calling . No . I 'm completely baffled . I have an idea of how you might communicate with your terrorist . Uh , I think it 's Special Agent Miller you 're looking for . No , no . I need to speak with you . I got your number from A.D. Walter Skinner , who sings your praises , by the way . Yes , I helped him with his migraines , which he claims are due to you . In any case , I was hoping I might impose upon you to delay your trip out to Texas . You can 't just tell me now ? It requires some explanation . You do realize the clock is ticking on this case , quite literally . I think it could save lives . Say no more . I 'm on my way . Where are you going ? I 'm catching the crazy train . I 'll see you down in Texas , Miller . WOMAN : When did radical Muslims become a protected class in America ? MAN : When the Founding Fathers signed the Constitution , that 's when . The same document that 's supposed to protect my freedom of speech . MAN : But not your freedom to hate ! What is wrong with you ? WOMAN : It is not a freedom to hate ! MAN : Why do you think these guys are acting this way ? Why do you think that guy went up and shot five servicemen in Chattanooga ? Because they loved him ? Because we treated him well ? Because we don 't plaster their names as terrorists all over the media ? No ! Because we hate them . WOMAN : We do not hate them . I will not ... MAN : Okay . WOMAN : No , we do not hate them . And I will not allow for that . We are not going to continue to spread lies about a people ... ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) Ah , come in , Agent Einstein . Have a seat . I came here in good faith , Agent Mulder , but lives are at stake . I 'm all about that . If there were another act of terror , and I 'm in here listening to some woo woo treatise on the paranormal , I don 't think I could forgive myself . ( STUTTERS ) I don 't do woo woo . Okay , what 's your big idea ? How are we going to talk with this terrorist ? Well , first , can we talk about the nature of reality , as you perceive it ? My reality is new chatter on the Internet about more suicide bombs . But do you believe that thoughts have mass ? That ideas such as faith and forgiveness have weight much the same way this desk has weight ? Or any material , really . ( SIGHS ) You are too much , Agent Mulder . It 's a legitimate question . There 's a legitimate answer . No . How can you be so sure ? Because when I stand on the scale and think of ice cream , my ass doesn 't grow . Need I illustrate further ? Yes , but I 'm sure you believe that words have weight , the weight to move people to go kill other people . People kill people . Bombs kill people . Words can incite people to kill people as instruments of hate , but are not lethal in and of themselves . Ever suck on a lemon , Agent Einstein ? Do you feel a sensation right now ? A quasi-measurable effect ? lam getting a taste of what Agent Scully must suffer . Neo-Darwinists believe that every word spoken , every thought , every perception , lest I misperceive , is a step in the evolution of mankind . Yes . A butterfly beats its wings in China , but that butterfly won 't be defusing explosives in any suicide vests . Agent Einstein , you have a terrorist lying in a state of existence somewhere between life and death . If he holds valuable intel on other terrorists , maybe in order to reach him , you need to expand your mind on the so-called material world . I got here as fast as I could . Thank you . Let me say , I 'm blown away you came down here to help me at all . Well , I sensed your frustration . I just want to believe there 's some way of reaching this young man and learning what he might know . Well , I believe there may be , but not the way you think . What way is that , Agent Scully ? Well , not through an oracle or a psychic or a seer , but through science . I don 't know how you mean . This may sound heavy , but this is a bit of a personal quest for me . My mother was in a coma recently , and I wasn 't able to communicate with her , either . I take it she 's passed ? I wish I 'd had the presence of mind to think of this when she was still alive . It might 've solved a mystery that I may never know . Please enlighten me , Agent Mulder , how nine years of college , three degrees , and two years at Quantico has left me such a simpleton . Not a simpleton . A mugwump . I resent that characterization , and I don 't even know what it means . It means sit down and shut up . ( GASPS ) You talk to Agent Scully like that ? Only when she 's being a mugwump . Please have a seat . I 'll give you two minutes , Agent Mulder , and then I 'm due back on Earth . Behold . Psilocybe tampanensis . I 'm afraid where this is going . The so-called magic mushroom , the study of which has begun anew by respected medical practitioners from Columbia University to Oxford . Oh . ( SNICKERS ) Highly contested studies . Highly uncontested results . Test subjects report experiences that transcended space and time , confrontations with the dead , touching the very face of God . That 's nice , Agent Mulder . You 've got about a minute and counting . Test subjects have also reported that once the impediment of the physical body is removed , deep and lasting truths are revealed that the conscious mind won 't allow . Feelings of ineffability , sacredness , peace , unity , joy , all without altering brain chemistry . Are you proposing , Agent Mulder , that we administer the magic mushroom to the terrorist ? No . No . I am proposing that you administer it to me , so that I can communicate with the terrorist , ( SIGHS ) learn what he knows , and prevent future acts of terror . To a technically dead man ? Death is now viewed by some as merely another plane of existence . I don 't think our terrorist has even achieved that plane . I believe he 's still reachable on this plane . So you called me back here to ask me to administer this drug , this illicit Schedule 1 substance . As a medical professional . Which Agent Scully is as well . Agent Scully has recently had her own life-altering death experience , and I don 't want to bother her with this . Oh . Oh , so you want to just keep it between us ? I would , if you don 't mind . No . No , I wouldn 't mind at all . Because there will be absolutely nothing to say , except maybe to Internal Affairs , if I were to go through with this lunatic scheme of yours . What is lunatic about it , exactly ? Let me think about that . Everything ? And rest assured , Agent Mulder , when I walk out of here , I will never again darken your basement door . So that 's a maybe ? ( EKG BEEPING ) It 's hard to imagine there 's someone in there , when you really see him . Research bears out a surprising incidence of electro-activity even in the most severely brain-damaged . What I want to try is a rather novel but not untested protocol . I 'm open to whatever . I 'm certain that you are , Agent Miller . I believe so many answers lie beyond the pale of the known world in realms of extreme possibility . I believe that you believe . So what are you proposing ? Doctors recently achieved the ability to communicate with a man known as Patient 23 through magnetic imaging , MRI , by prompting his otherwise inert and unresponsive brain with questions that triggered electro-activity . What kind of questions ? Mundane questions about housekeeping and tennis . But they unexpectedly lit up certain regions of his brain that translated to yes-and-no responses . That is incredible . Well , more incredibly , it can be achieved rather simply through the use of an ordinary electro-encephalogram . Why didn 't someone think of that ? But let me caution you . Even if we do reach this young man , it may be difficult to get the intel that you 're hoping for . Who 's Special Agent Miller ? I 'm Special Agent Miller . Gonna ask you to leave - FBI has no more jurisdiction here . Who has jurisdiction ? Department of Homeland Security . I was assigned this case . Agent Scully is a medical doctor . We think we can communicate ... Communicate ? To say what ? " You shouldn 't have done it , son " ? There 's a chance to question him about who was behind the bombing . And you think he 's gonna tell you ? By any moral definition , this body here isn 't a human . By my definition , this terrorist is dead . I 'm sorry , but what 's your business here ? I suggest that you both take a little breather and call your superiors in Washington , if you have any questions . We 're not leaving this room . ( WHISPERING IN ARABIC ) I 'm gonna ask you to leave . I 'll give the orders , Agent Miller . Wrong . I 'm giving the orders now . They 've come here for retribution . Whoever you 're calling , this goes way beyond ... I 'm not calling anyone . ( CAMERA CLICKING ) ( PHONE RINGING ) Special Agent Einstein . I 'm sorry , but I can 't let you in there without authorization . I 've been assigned this case with my partner , Special Agent Miller . Let me see that . ( CLEARS THROAT ) If you 're his partner , then who is Special Agent Dana Scully ? ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Agent Mulder , it 's Agent Einstein . How soon can you be in Texas ? Agent Mulder . Agent Einstein . For a second there , I thought you were gonna punk me . ( SIGHS ) I had a little trouble , uh , procuring the illicit substance . Wow . Where 'd you get these ? Apparently , Texas is something of a promised land . As it turns out , one of the early research pioneers is from here . So this is the real deal , huh ? I can 't speak to the dosage , and I certainly wouldn 't take both . Not till you 've experienced the one . May I ask , Agent Einstein , what changed your mind on this whole deal here ? I got here to find that Agent Scully was here in Texas working with Agent Miller . I sense some professional animus . Nothing professional about it . But you think this misguided . My loss is your gain , Agent Mulder . I 'll deal with Agent Miller about this later . In the meantime , we must conduct this business with a certain delicacy where the consumption of any potentially dangerous and psychotropic hallucinogen must be undertaken outside of a laboratory . You mean hide it like a couple of drug addicts . While this may seem foolhardy , I am anticipating results , that you will actually be communicating with the terrorist , somehow . Now , what he may say to you , or you to him , I have no clue . How do you say " howdy , pardner " in Arabic ? Thank you . You Agent Einstein ? No , I 'm Agent Dana Scully . Agent Miller ? Yes . ls there a problem ? I 'm Special Agent Brem , here to inform you that this hospital is under terror threat . I 've got a cordon of agents near the building as a precaution against an attack , but I need to clear this wing until we can bring in the bomb squad . You know where the threat came from ? Mmm . An anonymous caller , but a very clear guess , there 's a large and unassimilated Muslim community in the area , with one shared wish . One shared wish to what ? To wipe you and America off the map . To honor their hero , Osama bin Laden , whose picture we find all too frequently on their refrigerators . Not all Muslims are extremists , certainly . Feel free to stay here and take your chances , if you don 't believe me . There are other people who want to see this young man dead . I 'm not one of them , Agent Miller . Last thing I want is for this killer to die and go to paradise or to his 72 virgins in the sky . ( SCOFFS ) Sounds like torture to me . This boy can hear everything you 're saying , and we 're trying to win his trust and talk to him . Keep the killer alive . You do your job , we 'll do ours . AGENT BREM : Time to evacuate . Everybody out ! ( EKG BEEPING ) ( EKG BEEPING RAPIDLY ) ( EKG FLATLINING ) ( CLICKS ) ( EKG BEEPING ) There 's been a bomb threat . They 're asking us to leave . We have special authorization . That 's what everyone says . We 'll just need the room for a few minutes , to do research . Yeah , that 's what everyone says . You know , I 've never seen a patient receive so much attention . Especially one who 's so unworthy of it . Well , this is a special case . Just like all those immigrant groups coming over here , taking all our jobs , clogging up the health care system and our schools , and they don 't even speak English . We 're not gonna fix that right now , so ... A church group brought 200 Arab refugees to our town , and now they 're saying that they want to bring some more . Maybe we need to come back . Or maybe we can talk outside . NURSE : It 's all part of a government program paid for by my tax dollars , which means that I come to work every day , and I pay for these people ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) So I did some research , and I found out that this is all part of a plot by the United Nations to get these people into the U.S. , so that they can form terrorist cells . That sounds very suspicious . Mmm . Yeah . You turn your back on these people , you 're taking a chance . No . No , we don 't want to turn our backs . One more thing , you say you 're here doing research ? Yes . We 'll just be a few more minutes in the room , and then we 'll be evacuating , as well . Yeah . Well , your partner already left . ( SOMETHIN ' BAD PLAYING ) Stand on the box Stomp your feet , start clapping Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous Had to back it on up , couldn 't make it to the service Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress Got a real good feelin something bad about to happen Stand on the box , stomp your feet , start clapping I got a real good feeling something bad about to happen ... ( WOMEN CHEERING ) ( ACHY BREAKY HEART PLAYING ) You can tell the world you never was my girl You can burn my clothes up when I 'm gone Or you can tel ! my lips to tell my fingertips ( CROWD CHEERING ) They won 't be reaching out for you no more But don 't tell my heart My achy breaky heart I just don 't think he 'd understand And if you tell my heart My achy breaky heart He might blow up and kill this man ( CROWD CLAPPING IN UNISON ) Don 't tell my heart My achy breaky heart I just don 't think he 'd understand And if you tell my heart My achy breaky heart ( CROWD CHEERING ) He might blow up and kill this man ( HONKY TONK BADONKADONK PLAYING ) Left left left right left Hustlers shooting ' eightball Throwin ' darts at the wall ( CROWD CHEERING ) Feelin' damn near 10 feet tall Here she comes , Lord help us all OI ' T.W.

( SPEAKING ARABIC ) ( CHANTING IN ARABIC ) Can you hear my voice ? We don 't even know his name . ( SPEAKS ARABIC ) I was with the Bureau in Iraq . SCULLY : Keep talking , Agent Miller . ( SPEAKS ARABIC ) AGENT MILLER : The needles are moving . SCULLY : It could be a false positive . Aberrant neurological activity , not a response in and of itself . How do we know the difference ? Well , we need to set up a baseline , set up questions that serve as yes-no answers . It will be painstaking and difficult . I 'm just certain he hears us . SKINNER : Agent Mulder ? Agent Mulder ? Where 's your hat ? Rodeo 's over , cowboy . We 're hanging up your spurs for good . What are you talking about ? What am I talking about ? Dude , I was on fire . Dude , you were an embarrassment , to me and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Agent Einstein ? Agent Einstein , tell him . Tell him what , Agent Mulder ? What we were doing was under your medical supervision , all on the up and up . It was until it wasn 't . Well , it 's not like it was volitional . What was it , Agent Mulder ? It was the magic mushrooms . Maybe I took too much . Maybe you didn 't take enough . What 's that supposed to mean ? Agent Einstein informed me that you requested that she administer an illicit substance to you in your rather reckless attempt to talk to an alleged mass murderer . Yeah , and administer them she did . These are what I gave you , Agent Mulder . Yeah , that stuff , that 's potent . This stuff is purchasable at any corner drugstore . Maybe in Texas it is . These are niacin capsules , Agent Mulder . What I gave you is a placebo . No way - No way . That 's impossible . I was under the influence of something powerful . Yes . The power of suggestion . No , you were there . And The Lone Gunmen . The Badonkadonk . Yeah , I was in Washington , Agent Mulder . This is what I 'm saying ! I think he 's still tripping . Well , the placebo effect has been known to have a lasting psychological outcome . I talked to the terrorist . You talked to the terrorist ? Yes . He whispered in my ear . Well , what did he say , Agent Mulder ? I can 't tell you what he said . It was in Arabic . Well , I 'm gonna get you a wheelchair so we can get you home , partner , all right ? Well , you were there , too . And you were 50 shades of bad . You know this is ridiculous . We don 't want you dancing away . ( STAMMERS ) So I did dance ? According to a whole bunch of very frightened , middle-aged Texans . ( SIGHS ) You 're just covering your ass . Well , either way . I 'll be looking at disciplinary action over my own dismal failure of authority . Thanks to you , I 'll probably be banished to my own basement office , consigned to a life of ridicule and ignominy ... Stop ! Stop . ( WOMAN SHOUTING ) WOMAN : I 'm begging you ! MULDER : Hey . I know this woman . It 's okay . Maybe you haven 't failed . Agent Scully . Miller . This is Noora . She 's come here today to talk to her son , Shiraz . Mulder , where did you find her ? Please don 't ask him that . ( GASPS ) It 's okay . ( PANTING ) Got you . ( SOBBING ) ( SPEAKS ARABIC ) We believe that he can hear you . Then my prayers are answered . Oh ... My beautiful baby boy , Shiraz . You could not ever kill anyone . This is not how I raised you , to worship Allah through death . To be a man by following men . Your heart is too big for them . You see the faces of the innocent , and you lose your nerves . You cannot go through with the bomb . Noora , how do you know that ? Because my Shiraz tells me so , in my dreams and in my prayers . Who filled his head , Noora ? ( SPEAKS ARABIC ) I do not know how to help you because I do not know their names . ( GROANING ) ( EKG BEEPING RAPIDLY ) He 's going into cardiac arrest . ( EKG FLATLINING ) Blood pressure 's dropping . AGENT EINSTEIN : I 'm gonna go get help . No , no , I think he 's trying to tell us . SCULLY : Now we 're losing him ! Shiraz , please , please . ( SOFTLY ) I 'm so sorry . No , Shiraz ! ( SOBBING ) SCULLY : I 'm sorry . Let 's give her some space . NOORA : Oh , my Shiraz . He talked to us . NOORA : Oh , Shiraz . He talked to me . This is exactly how I saw it . Agent Mulder , please ... He spoke to me . Shiraz . He spoke to me . SCULLY : What do you mean he spoke to you ? Spoke to you when , Agent Mulder ? With the help of Agent Einstein . Ugh . Agent Mulder , please stop . Mulder , when could he possibly have spoken to you ? I can explain . Or I can 't explain . He spoke to me . In Arabic . In Arabic ? In words I didn 't understand , yeah . What words , Agent Mulder ? ( MUTTERING ) Babbel ... Babbel ... Babell . ( MUTTERING ) Babil ? Babil al ... Something . " Babil " is " Babylon , " the city . Like in ancient Babylon ? Just ... Babil al ... I feel like I need to explain . Just let him finish , please . Babil al ... Babil ... Mulder , are you okay ? ( MUTTERING ) Funduuk . Babil , a ! funduuk . Babylon the hotel ? ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( PUMPS SHOTGUN ) ( CHANTS IN ARABIC ) ( CLAMORING ) ( SECRET HEART PLAYING ) Secret heart What are you made of ? What are you so afraid of ? Could it be three simple words Or the fear of being overheard ' ? What 's wrong ? Let her in on your secret heart Secret heart , why so mysterious ? ( SIGHS ) Why so sacred , why so serious ? Maybe you 're just acting tough ... Not staying for the attaboys ? I didn 't really do anything . Huh . Nothing but take down a terror cell ready to kill untold numbers . That was all Agent Mulder . That 's not how I understand it . I 'm told you kept that boy alive , that you kept him safe from harm . I translated a few words . It was all you and Agent Mulder . ( CHUCKLES ) Remarkably , I did nothing . And , remarkably , it worked . Although I 'm at a loss in explaining it . Maybe some things are unexplainable , Agent Einstein . Hmm . The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious , the source of all true art and science . That 's beautiful , Einstein . Yes , Einstein . That 's who said it , Miller . The real mystery here is your behavior , bringing Agent Scully down here without bothering to consult me . Remarkably , I did nothing . It was you who abandoned me , Agent Einstein , for the crazy train . Ah . Never again , Agent Miller . Although something is clearer to me now , as a result of the experience . The value of an open mind ? The nature of reality . I 'm now convinced that words and ideas do have weight , the weight to move people to do the most psychotic things . Giving someone magic mushrooms ? I was talking about Agent Mulder . Right . ( HO HEY PLAYING ) Ho ! Hey ! Ho ! Hey ! Ho ! I 've been trying to do it right Hey ! I 've been living a lonely life Ho ! I 've been sleeping here instead Hey ! I 've been sleeping in my bed Ho ! I 've been sleeping in my bed Hey ! Ho ! Ho ! So show me family Hey ! All the blood that I will bleed Ho ! I don 't know where I belong Hey ! I don 't know where I went wrong Ho ! But I can write a song Hey ! One , two , three I belong with you , you belong with me , you 're my sweetheart Talk to me , Mulder . Where to begin ? Why didn 't you tell me about your little scheme ? You were on your own mission . And you would 've never bought that . Absolutely right . I have to applaud her , though , on her clever trick with the placebo . Yeah . Yeah . How did that work ? Wonders never cease with you . I saw things , though , Scully . Powerful things . I saw deep and unconditional love . I saw things , too . I witnessed unqualified hate that appears to have no end . Yeah . But how to reconcile the two ? The extremes of our nature . That 's the question . Maybe the question of our times . Walk with me , Scully . This whole thing has got me thinking . Thinking about God . You , Mulder , thinking about God ? The angry God of the Bible . The Tower of Babel and Babylon , scattering people violently , so as never to speak a common language . Punishing man for his hubris . Well , that lesson didn 't stick . But the anger sure remains . That 's the same angry God as in the Koran , ordering death to the infidels . What exactly is this God saying ? " Worship me and my great anger " ? Well , that 's a good question , Mulder . One for the ages . Well , think about the immense power in those prophecies , the power in those words to convince young men to put on suicide vests today and murder for their angry God . What are you getting at ? Those boys , they just swallow the pill . It 's the power of suggestion . Is this received wisdom from your magical mystery tour ? Yes . Courtesy of the shrooms , something else , something to trump all hatred . Mother Love . Whoa . Now , I refuse to believe that mothers are having babies just to be martyrs . I want to believe that mothers have a greater purpose for all of us . I agree . A child is not a tool to spread hatred . But where does the hatred end , though ? Maybe it ends where it began , by finding a common language again . Maybe that 's God 's will . How can we really know ? He 's absent from the stage . Well ... Maybe it 's beyond words . Maybe we should do like the prophets and open our hearts and truly listen . ( CHUCKLES ) ( INDISTINCT INSTRUMENT BLARING ) What ? Did you hear that ? What ? I belong with you , you belong with me , you 're my sweetheart I belong with you , you belong with me , you 're my sweet ... Ho ! Hey ! Come on , now Hey ! Ho ! The last one Hey !

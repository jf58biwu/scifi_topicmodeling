 There 's no going back now . Why would you want to ? What has the world outside ever given to you ? Nothing . Less than nothing . I wanted to be a healer . That 's your past talking . You 're so much more than that now . You 've shed your old clothing along with your old life . You 're reborn now . Ascendant . Under your guidance , we will prevail . We will take back our Abbey . Our island . Why stop there ? The outside world is soul-sick , Anne . Why not heal it ? We can expand our reach all the way to the mainland . The island has always been our home . That 's your past talking . First , we need to break the naval blockade . What we lack is leverage . We need to control something they want . How ? We 're trapped here . Trapped with the CDC . They 've discovered a cure for Mycosis . We need to get our hands on that cure . Then we eliminate them . Stings a bit . It 's better than the alternative . What 's this for ? You need it worse than I do . Coast Guard needs it too . Get it off the island . I don 't know what to say . I mean , I tried to kill you yesterday . That wasn 't you , it was the pathogen . I was wrong about you . I used to think there was a right and a wrong no in-between . But immortality turned all that upside down . I were you , I 'd forget I ever set foot on this island . Can 't do that . When this is all over , I still gotta turn you in . I 'll tell you what , I 'll make you a deal . This is all over , I 'll turn myself in . But first I need a favor . - All right . - I need to borrow your gun . And I need to know what happened in Paris . First Bank of Atlanta . Safety deposit box 274 . You 'll find all the proof you need . Mother 's dead . No fungal antigens , nothing . You could try an ammonium nitrogen-based fertilizer . That would take a month . I 've only got one day before the Narvik release . Did you hear what I said ? - Sorry . What ? - Nothing . Just the end of the human race as we know it . You 'll figure something out . You always do . What is that ? Homemade perfluorocarbon . Highly oxygenated , breathable . Similar to what Dr. Adrian was using on Peter to keep him alive . I think it might work here . - For how long ? - Indefinitely . As long as he 's receiving fresh infusions every 30 minutes . You 're gonna inject fluid into that jar every half hour for the rest of your life ? If I have to . Jules ? My God . Is that our child ? Why don 't I let you two have some time alone ? So that 's where the root came from . The Mother Tree . She 's the reason we 're on this island . Michael discovered her so many years ago . Her root system contained amazing medicinal properties . Like infertility ? Michael spent decades studying her . After she died , he took pieces of the root and grafted them onto other plantings . The piece that was lost was the last remnant of the original tree . I need to go to the tree 's location . There may be viable seeds or pieces of root left . - That 's not possible . - It 's a long shot , but I have to try . You misunderstand . I 'd take you there if I could . Michael was the only one who knew its location . But this painting ... . Is nearly 300 years old . It 's a view from a hill near the Abbey , but the tree is long gone . There must be some record . You 're welcome to look through Michael 's ledgers provided you have Eli 's permission . Who 's Eli ? Eli , Dr. Walker would like a word . What the hell ? Peter . Where are your clothes ? Peter is dead . This is Eli , the new leader of our order . Eli ? - All right , you 're kidding , right ? - A new man deserves a new name . - Eli means " ascendant " in- - - I don 't care what it means . Peter , you 're a doctor . Are you gonna throw away everything for this ? I found a higher calling a sense of purpose , a place to belong . Much like you did . All right , Eli . I need full access to Michael 's records . That won 't be a problem , as long as we get something in return . I already offered you immunity from Ilaria . I want the same for my followers . Ilaria stays off this island . No persecution , no Narvik , nothing . I can arrange that . Plus a royalty on the sale of the infertility apples , 10 percent . - Oh , come on . - Make it 20 . It looks like you 're still Peter after all . He 's been fed . It 's time for his nap . Anne , gather the followers in the counsel hall . Have them arm themselves . It 's time to take care of our CDC problem . Yes , Eli . - You sure you 're okay , Dr. Kyle ? - I 'm fine , Soren . Gotta get to the lab , help Dr. Jordan . But what about your My ... ? - Mycosis ? - Yeah . I 'm getting better , just like you did . Dr. Alan fixed me . - I wanna fix people too . - Is that right ? Yeah . I can come work with you at the CDC . I 'd have you on my team anytime . Soren , I need to talk to Dr. Kyle , alone . - But I 'm helping him . - Now . Don 't back-talk me . You need to get out of here now . - Out of where ? - The island . Get as far away as you can . Believe me , I 'm trying . What 's going on ? I don 't want him to kill Alan , you and Dr. Jordan . - " Him " who ? - Eli . Peter . - He won 't let you leave the island alive . - You heard him say that ? He wants the cure . And once he gets it , you 're gonna end up in a barrel . I found this . There 's a Coast Guard radio in there . Call for help . Do whatever . Just get off the island . Why are you telling me this ? You saved my Soren , you and Dr. Alan . Doesn 't seem possible . There 's no scientific evidence to explain it , but ... . Not yet . But it doesn 't matter how . The fact is , is that he 's alive in this jar . And I need to find a way to get him off this island . What kind of life is he gonna have ? I don 't know , but I am willing to spend an eternity to figure out a way for him to have a normal life . Why don 't you come with me ? If there 's anybody who can help me figure this out , it 's you . Sarah , I can 't . You can 't ? He 's your son too . But you can 't because of your obsession with Ilaria and killing immortals . Well , why don 't you start with me , Alan ? I 'm standing here right in front of you . I have to finish what I started . I should 've told you I was going to see Dr. Kyle . No , no , no , Soren , you didn 't do anything wrong . Now , I need you to listen to me . Mommy made a terrible mistake . What did you do ? I can 't explain right now , but I 'm trying to fix it . So I need you to do something for me . Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek ? That spot you used to hide ? But I don 't want to hide . Dr. Kyle 's my friend . I can help too . You can help by staying out of sight . Soren . Promise me . I promise . You scared me . I figured I 'd find you up here poring through 500 years of clues . Believe me , there 's not much to find . What do you want , Alan ? Actually , I came to apologize . I came at you pretty hard yesterday . It was unfair . I appreciate that . I 'd like to help . You find anything of use ? I 'm not sure yet . This is a painting of the Mother Tree . I might be able to use reference points to determine its location . Assuming the painting 's true to life we have no way of knowing if it 's accurate . Well , Michael was a geneticist but over the centuries he was also an artist a cartographer and an astronomer . Man had a lot of time on his hands . Landscapes change , mountains erode and forests die but one thing stays the same . The stars . Do you remember that weekend in Yosemite ? - With the leaky tent . - You said there was a way to use astronomical coordinates to determine a precise location . - Declination and ascension , yeah . - Right . You were showing off . I was trying to show you where Ansel Adams shot Autumn Moon . You were trying to get me back in the tent . What if there 's a way to compare the stars in the sky ... - ... to the painting ? - It 's a good theory . But we have no idea when this was painted . No , but that might only be the difference of a few degrees . It could still give us an idea of the tree 's location . That 's good work . Yeah . The work 's just getting started . Sarah . Thank God you 're here . We gotta pack up and get out . - What the hell is that ? - It 's my son . Your what ? When were you pregnant ? - It was a- - - No , stop . You know what , you can explain it to me on the way . Nothing on this island surprises me anymore . - No , I 'm not going anywhere . - Sarah , please . - They 're coming to kill us . - Who ? Peter 's gone off the deep end . We gotta call for an evac or we 're gonna be scattered in that boneyard . Come on . - Come on , Sarah . We gotta go . - Don 't rush me . - Sarah , come on , please . - Do not rush me . Too late . They 're coming . Kyle , stop . We gotta keep moving . What 's wrong ? Something 's leaking onto my back . No . It 's leaking . What- - ? What are you doing ? Juicy Fruit . There is no substitute . Did this with my fishbowl back home . Your goldfish was named Copernicus . Mine was Aikman . - Figures . - Yeah . That 'll hold for a while . But we gotta get the hell up there , call for an evac . No , no , he can 't live inside a cracked jar . I have to get him a new one . - Where we gonna find that ? - Amy said there are more in the Abbey . Since she 's indisposed , I have to find Anne . - You gotta be kidding . We gotta go . - You can go if you want . But if I don 't get him another jar in 30 minutes , he 's gonna die . Okay . We 'll split up and find Anne . Meet back here , 30 minutes . - No , Kyle , you don 't have to . - I 'm not leaving without you . Or your son . I barely recognize this place . It 'll take time , but the island will heal . Incredible what nature can do when left alone . Is that another Ilaria " save the planet " talking point ? Look out there , Alan . It 's the hand of man . It 's what we do best , isn 't it ? Take something beautiful , then destroy it ? And Ilaria never destroyed anything ? Only in service of the greater good . - Jesus . You can 't believe that . Can you ? - Alan . It doesn 't matter what I believe . There 's no defeating Ilaria . They are everywhere . In every major city , in every branch of government . I 've seen their plans . Has it ever occurred to you that they might be lying ? - About what ? - Narvik-C . Think about it , Jules . Hatake needed several lifetimes to do what some genius at Ilaria perfected in under a year ? It 's not just the beard , you 've really gone full conspiracy theorist . Look , I know this can 't be easy for you . It wasn 't easy for me either . Well , that 's the thing . It was too easy . I killed all those immortals for you , Jules . And I 'd have killed 10,000 more for you . You were the one , Alan . You 're the closest I came to knowing anyone and I tried to let you know me too . But there was just something missing . - I was missing . - No . It wasn 't you . You wanna believe you could 've done something to change things . It 's me . It 's what I am . My father , Hatake , immortality . Arctic Biosystems was the worst and best thing that ever happened to me because I finally made sense . He 's asleep . The CDC doctors have fled . - And the cure ? - We scoured the entire lab . They must have taken it with them . I 'm so sorry . I should 've known . Don 't apologize . I 'm not Michael . You could never disappoint me . - Someone must have warned them . - But who would do such a thing ? No one else knew- - Olivia . She was in the room with us . What do you want me to do ? Keep the search going for the CDC . I 'll handle everything else . Show no mercy . Show no mercy . Okay , where are you , Polaris ? Find the Big Dipper . And from those two pointer stars at five times the distance . There she is , the North Star . This can 't be right . - Well , maybe it 's just a painting , Jules . - I combed through Michael 's files . He was meticulous about his work , almost obsessive . Why would he be different on this ? So we have the star , where 's the hill ? It 's there . It 's almost as if ... . I assumed we were at the vantage point , but I got it backwards . The star , the hill , the triangulation point it 's not the steeple . The tree 's here at the Abbey . I think there 's someone over here . All clear . All clear . Eli . You seem nervous , Olivia . Is anything wrong ? No . I just really want to find my Soren , make sure he 's okay . If you care about your son why risk everything by telling the CDC we were coming for them ? No , Eli , I would never betray you . There 's no need to lie . That will only make it worse . Please , I just want to be with my son . - Please , I just want to be with him . - I know you do . Olivia , I know . I 'm sorry but we gotta go before they come back . - Soren . - Why did he kill my mom ? No reason . He 's just an evil man who did a terrible thing . He 's a doctor , like you . He 's supposed to fix people . Sometimes people pretend to be someone they 're not . I don 't want to pretend . I want to be someone else . No one deserves what you 've been through . And after all I did to you , you still saved me and Alan . I 'd say that makes you the bravest person I 've ever met . I 'm not brave . I could 've saved her , but I was too scared . Soren . You listen to me . Listen . None of this is your fault . You hear me ? None of it . I lost my mom too when I was just a few years older than you . I still think about her every day . That way she 's always with me , no matter what . But my mom was my only family and now I 'm all alone . I 'll be your family now , if you want . I 'll check over here . I 'll take this side . They 're not here . Split up and circle the grounds . The doctors can 't have gone far . Put it down . Not one word . I understand . Now , what do you want , Dr. Jordan ? Michael 's premature-baby experiments , where are the life-support units ? - Why ? - Because I 'm the one holding the knife . There 's no need to threaten me . Just settle down . Sit . Where are they ? - If I refuse to say ? - You 're gonna tell me one way or another . This place is so beautiful . Michael built himself a shrine to Mother Nature . Hard to believe somebody capable of so much beauty could be responsible for so many horrors . More common than you 'd think . What was he like ? Michael , what kind of man was he ? Loved the sound of his own voice . - A narcissist ? - A lunatic . But he did have a gift for oratory . Hell for Michael was a room without an audience . Jules , what are we doing ? The tree 's not here . Is this where he would speak ? He called it counseling . Jules , what the hell are you- - ? - Help me . - Help you what ? Help me pull up this floor . The Mother Tree . Michael built the Abbey right on top of it . He must have had some way to access its roots . There 's an extensive tunnel system under the Abbey but we don 't have a painting to guide us . Good thing I have you . Where are they ? If you turn yourself over to Eli , he may show you mercy . - Who 's Eli ? - You knew him as Peter Farragut . - Peter is a lot of things . - And he will be so much more to so many people . You 're serious . It 's no wonder that Amy turned out the way that she did . You have no idea what it is to be a parent . - I am a parent . - No . You 're not . - That thing there is not a child . - Shut up . And keeping it like that is cruel and pointless . If I hear one more word that isn 't the location of those jars- - Why don 't you put that away ? We both know you won 't use it . Oh , really ? What the hell is this place ? This is where Michael bestowed his greatest gift upon the world . The gift of life . What have you done to them ? Their throats , their voices . Only in silence could they find peace . Where are the life-support units ? Where are they ? - Release them . All of them . - I will not . You can do it with half your toes or none at all . When I was a boy I used to dream they made a mistake at the hospital and they switched babies . I used to pray that I didn 't actually belong to that family to that man . Now I understand that blood is meaningless . You are my son my family . Years of med school couldn 't teach me what you did in just one day . DNA , RNA , the building blocks ... . That 's not what it is to be human what it means to be a man a father . It 's all the things we can 't see that make us who we are . Love hope . I will give you everything my father didn 't give me . Blood is meaningless . Family is everything . Oh , my God . This is unbelievable . We 're inside the root system of a tree . - Come on . - The tree 's dead , Jules . - Probably been dead for generations . - An organism this big ? There are root systems that have been alive for 80,000 years . Trees , not stumps . You 're too late . Mayday , Mayday . This is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the CDC . Requesting immediate evacuation from St. Germain Island . Do you copy ? Mayday , Mayday , this is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the- - Sarah ? Did you find Anne ? - I found her . - Did you get her to talk ? She talked . What happened ? Whose blood is that ? I 'll tell you after about five years of therapy . Mayday , Mayday , this is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the CDC . Requesting immediate evacuation from St. Germain Island . Does anybody copy ? This is the USS Portledge . You are on a priority military channel . Sign off immediately . This is Dr. Kyle Sommer . We need an evac . I don 't care who you are . Switch your frequency . Listen up , I have the cure for the pathogen that 's infecting your ships . If you want it , you better put somebody on the line that can get me an evac . Hold for Captain Wilson . Anne . Oh , my God . What happened ? Who did this to you ? - Who ? - Dr . Jordan . Sarah ? She made me take her to the birthing chamber . - We need to get you to the infirmary . - No . You have to stop her and Dr. Sommer . They 're trying to leave the island . Where are they now ? No , no , no . - What happened ? - The vials are broken . I don 't have more . Well , then there 's nothing you can do . Look . Do you see this ? The fungal enzyme . It spilled into the ground . Do you know what this means ? It 's Mother . She 's everywhere . All right . Soren , you go first . Then you , Sarah . We 're taking fire ! Hang on ! - Come back ! - No ! Come back ! The fungus it 's in the soil around the roots . But you don 't have the root . I don 't need it . Mother was just a repository for the fungus . With modern gene-splicing , we can insert the fungus into any plant we want . We can create widespread infertility without any Mycotic effects . This is incredible . We can create seeds , plantings whole orchards in the span of a few years . This will eliminate the need for Narvik . I 'm sorry , Jules . Alan , what are you doing ? Stopping Ilaria . By killing me ? I 'm trying to stop them too . No . If you do this , you 're as bad as they are . Alan , you 're making a huge mistake . Please . You have to let me go . I can 't .

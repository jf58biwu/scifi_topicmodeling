 Previously on " the 100 " ... Hundreds of your people Are trapped inside mount weather . Their blood is used as medicine . My people are prisoners there , too . Why are you showing us this ? Because i 'm afraid . Of what ? That you 're next . Harper didn 't show up for breakfast . You guys seen her ? The only way to save both our people Is if we join together . I 'm in love with you . Everything i 've done , all that matters Is that you 're ok . Deliver me the one you call finn . Our truce begins with his death . No . Finn ! What will they do to him ? Lincoln : Finn took 18 lives . He will suffer the pain of 18 deaths . I love you , too . You 're gonna be ok . Thanks , princess . No ! [ panting ] [ sniffles ] [ sobbing ] [ sobbing continues ] Let me . They would 've tortured him . I had to . I- - It 's ok . It 's ok . I had to . It 's ok . What did i do ? [ sobbing ] Gustus : The commander is ready to talk . Mm-hmm . Blood has answered blood . Some on my side say that 's not enough . They wanted the murderer to suffer As our tradition demands , But they do not know that your suffering Will be worse . What you did tonight will haunt you Until the end of your days . Still , there will be restitution . The body will be given to the people of tondc , Murderer and murder joined by fire . Only then can we have peace . Kane : No . No . We 've done enough . The boy should be buried by his own people . Enough ? We were owed the pain of 18 deaths . We were owed our righteous kill . My village deserves justice . You don 't want justice . You want vengeance . You have not seen my vengeance . We 'll do it ... But when it 's over , we talk about how To get our people out of mount weather , All of our people . We want the same things , clarke . Good . When do we leave ? Now . Choose your attendants . Clarke , you don 't have to do this . Yes , i do . If this truce doesn 't hold , I killed finn for nothing . Clarke is right . We need to do this . Peace with the grounders Is the only way we 'll survive . Oh , i don 't think they know what peace is . The commander does . She 's a child . They 're being led by a child . So are we . Go away . Raven , i 'm sorry . I said , go away ! I know how hard this must be for you , But i 'm leaving with the grounders , And i need you to keep working on the radio . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? They need to take him now . Like hell , they do . Get off . Give us a minute , please . Raven- - You agreed to this ? We 're taking him back to the village Where the massacre took place . There 's a death ritual . It 's the only way to get our people Out of mount weather . Then i 'm coming , too , and--don 't worry- - I 'll bring your damn radio . Oh ... Oh ... [ music playing on radio ] [ music volume increases ] Anything ? Keep looking . Whatever happened to harper , Someone must have seen something . How many places could she be ? We 're in a sealed bunker . Jasper : There has to be rooms we don 't know about , Places that aren 't mapped . Miller : Well ? Is it possible ? I doubt it , but maybe . Thanks . You are just a big help . Jasper : Easy , miller . Maya is on our side . Are you sure about that ? Yes . I 'm sure . She 's risking more than any of us . Really ? Is she 's gonna end up in the kennel , too , If she gets caught ? Monty : Stop it . I found something . That leads to an antenna on the ground , ok ? If we can access the radio , We can send a message over the arkwide channel , Tell them we 're here . Maya : The only radio is in the command center On level 7 , highly restricted . You got in before . Only because it was scheduled for decontamination . That won 't work again so soon . We don 't need the radio . We need the wires that run into it . Here . The art warehouse . That i can get us into . Good . Now all we have to do Is break through a two-foot section of wall , Find the outgoing wire , And jack it to a closed system Without being heard by anyone In the command center or in the field . That 's all , huh ? No . We 'll also need to steal some copper wire , The guard schedules , and a walkie-talkie- - Oh , yeah--and a big-ass hammer . [ horse neighs ] Hey , you doing all right ? Yeah . You did the right thing . Now i get to live with it . You still think this truce is a bad idea , don 't you ? I think we 're wasting time with politics While our friends are in trouble . We need their army to get to mount weather , bellamy , And you know it . Their army has been getting their ass kicked By mount weather forever . What we need is an inside man , Someone to be our eyes and ears . Forget it . It 's too dangerous . Clarke , if you can make it out , I can make it in . I said no . Since i don 't take orders from you , I 'm gonna need a better reason . I can 't lose you , too , ok ? Cage : Brief me . Yes , sir . The commander 's force never attacked the ark . Instead , at 0600 this morning , They withdrew into these woods here . Outsiders never withdraw , lieutenant . No , sir , but under this commander , They do make alliances . Is that what happened here ? It 's unclear , sir , But it 's a possibility we need to consider . Sir , if this is an alliance Between the outsiders and the ark , There are things we can do to break it . We let them kill each other So they don 't come here To take their people back . I don 't care how many men they have . They will not get past our defenses . Sir , we shouldn 't take this threat lightly . We 're not , lieutenant . You have my word on that . Nothing is gonna stop us From getting to the ground . Clarke , it 's safer on our side . We need to trust them , bellamy . Clarke : There are no more sides . Hey ... We need to talk about jaha . I can 't keep him locked up forever . Maybe i should shocklash him . I was gonna suggest a pardon . Hmm . Clarke is a survivor . She 'll get through this , too . Natrona . " natrona " ? Traitor . My people fear me . They think the reaper is still inside . You can talk to me About what happened . I can 't . You 're not that monster . I hope you 're right . [ gasps ] [ gate rumbling ] Weapons . We need to disarm before we enter . Nou ogonzaun . Veida ! Veida ! Nou ogonzaun ! Veida ! Veida ! Ripa ! Veida ! Veida ! [ shouting continues ] Uh ! Commander , stop him . Please . They 'll blame us for this , too . Uh ! [ coughing ] The sky people march with us now . Anyone who tries to stop that Will pay with their life . Warm welcome . Right here . The communication lines are behind this wall . Heh heh . Big-ass enough for you ? Wait . They 'll hear you . This was the plan . I knew it . She 's afraid of losing her blood supply . Look . You don 't have to like me , miller , And you can blame me all you want For what my people are doing , But i 'm trying to make things right . Then get the hell out of my way . 5 seconds . What happens in 5 seconds ? Miller realizes what a dick he is ? [ alarm blaring ] Friend owed me a favor . Time it to the blasts . Jackpot . " people of tondc , In fire , we cleanse the pain of the past . " Clarke ... [ murmuring ] I 've set it up to play our sos On a loop over the arkwide channel . If i can get it to transmit , Somebody is bound to hear it . [ oscillating signal ] Oh , that don 't sound good . I 've heard this On the black box of the exodus ship Right before it crashed . They crashed the exodus ship . Jamming signal . What are they jamming now ? Everything , Probably to keep our people from talking to each other . Are we totally screwed ? I wouldn 't say totally . I lost someone special to me , too . Her name was costia . She was captured by the ice nation , Whose queen believed she knew my secrets . Because she was mine ... They tortured her , killed her , Cut off her head . I 'm sorry . I thought i 'd never get over the pain , But i did . How ? By recognizing it for what it is- - Weakness . What is ? Love ? So you just stopped caring About everyone ? I could never do that . Then you put the people you care about In danger , and the pain will never go away . The dead are gone , clarke . The living are hungry . Please accept this gift , commander . We drink this at special occasions . I believe this qualifies . Thank you , marcus of the sky people . You 're welcome , lexa . Kom trikru . Just don 't drink too much of it . Clarke , let us drink together . It would be my pleasure . Gustus : And allow me . Tonight we celebrate our newfound peace . Tomorrow we plan our war . To those we 've lost And to those we shall soon find . Uh ! [ coughing ] It 's poison ! It was the sky people . Yaagh ! This wasn 't us . You have to know this wasn 't us . No . No . No . We didn 't do this . Gustus warned me about you , But i didn 't listen . Lexa , please- - Tell me something , clarke . When you plunged the knife into the heart Of the boy you loved , Did you not wish that it was mine ? That 's not mine . I 'm telling you , that 's not mine . He put it there when he searched me . No sky person leaves this room . Do something . Indra ... [ oscillating signal ] Damn it . So now we 're totally screwed ? Our message is broadcasting , But it 's over a jammed frequency . So then unjam it . What do you think i 've been trying to do ? Looks like the only way to shut it down Is from the source . I need 5 minutes in the command center . No way . You heard maya . It 's too dangerous . Maya : The guard is coming . We 're gonna have to go . Cover the hole . Right . No . Leave it . Right . Ok . Jasper : All right . Quick . He 's too close . What are we gonna do ? I got an idea . What ? This . Out now . Don 't let me catch you kids in here again . Sorry . Raven ... I need to know the truth . I 'd step back if i was you . You wanted me to kill lexa yesterday . If you tried to poison her , i need to know . You 're the only murderer here . Leave me alone . You gave me no choice . Why did you turn yourself in ? Baby , you ok ? Listen to me , clarke . I know how you feel , Like the pain will never go away , But lexa is wrong . You won 't be haunted by this forever . The pain will fade . What got me through was loving you . What is it ? You 're talking about dad ? What i did to finn Was nothing like what you did to him . Don 't do this now , clarke . I was protecting everyone . I didn 't have a choice . You did . No . You turned him in . No . I trusted thelonious to talk to your father And convince him not to go public . You knew dad would never stop . You knew what would happen to him . I was protecting everyone , too . I was protecting you . Clarke , please . We are the same . [ music playing on radio ] [ music volume increases ] They find the radio ? No . Where 's monty ? Thought he was with you . Maya : I haven 't seen him . [ knocks on door ] Again ? We were hosed down yesterday . Routine follow-up . Shouldn 't take long . [ door closes ] Raven : We have to get out of here . We have to get out of here . Tearing each other and yourself apart Isn 't a way to get through this . Lexa needs this alliance just as much as we do . She 's shown herself to be flexible . She listens to you . She thinks we tried to kill her . But we know we didn 't . So let 's figure out who did . Who would want her dead ? Lincoln : Too many to count . Forming an alliance with you was a risk , Especially after what finn did to this village . Octavia : So it had to be someone Trying to break the alliance . [ door opens ] How 's gustus ? Gustus will live . Kane : Wait . Wait . What are you doing ? Bellamy : She didn 't poison anyone . Indra : I argued for all of you to die , But the commander is merciful . She wants only one . She 's innocent . I don 't care . They move , they bleed . Hey , hey , stop . Let her go . The rest of you are free . When she 's dead , so is the alliance . You should run . I take no joy in this , raven . But this time , justice will be done . I didn 't do it . How is that justice ? We have to do something . Wait . We can 't . Octavia : Lincoln , talk to them . Aah ! [ whimpering ] Aah ! Lincoln , talk to them . These are your people . Not anymore . You 're not longer safe here , my friend . I 'll do my best to make sure you get away . Then you 'll be on your own . [ raven screaming ] Abby : Clarke , we need to move now . I can 't save anyone . [ raven screaming ] Say something . [ screaming continues ] Abby : Clarke , now . [ screaming continues ] It wasn 't in the bottle . [ screaming continues ] Bellamy : Clarke , stop . What are you doing ? You 'll get yourself killed . I need that bottle now . [ screaming continues ] Stop . Let her pass ! One of your people tried to kill you , lexa , Not one of mine . You should 've run . I can prove it . Explain . The poison wasn 't in the bottle . It was in the cup . It was you . He tested the cup . He searched raven . Gustus would never harm me . You weren 't the target . The alliance was . Clarke : We didn 't do this , and you know it . This alliance would cost you your life , heda . [ murmuring ] I could not let that happen . This treachery will cost you yours . Uhh ... [ beeping ] Come on . Alpha station , you better be listening . Ok . Here we go . Jamming signal deactivated . Jasper , on radio : We don 't know how much time we have left . Please hurry . This is jasper jordan . We need help . 47 of us are trapped ... Yes ! Yes ! Yes- - Jasper , on radio : We don 't know how much time we have left . Please hurry . This is jasper jordan . We need help . You sure they went together to that village ? Sure as we can be . Sir , i told you We need more boots on the ground . Sergeant ... Why aren 't you at your post ? Sir . Routine decon , sir . All clear , gentlemen . [ door closes ] Hold up . You forgot to log in . Whoops . I 'm always doing that . Oh . Thanks for saving me . Take care . You said it was all clear . Your entry says something else . You sure ? Huh . That 's weird . If you don 't mind , i 'll fix it later . I have another room to check . Oh ! [ labored breathing ] Ugh ... Uh ! This would 've been finn . [ slice ] Rrgh ! Ugh ... We 're not so different , Are we ? How did you know it was gustus ? He 'd do anything for her To protect her . Just makes sense . Look at the thanks he got . Guys ... What is it ? Raven : Listen to this . Jasper , on radio : 47 of us are trapped inside mount weather . Talk to him . Say something . It 's repeating . Octavia : They 're alive . We need to do this now . You 've got the alliance . Now is the time to use it . First , we need an inside man . You were right . Without someone on the inside To lower their defenses , turn off the acid fog , An army is useless . You should go . I thought you hated that plan , That i would get myself killed . I was being weak . It 's worth the risk . My map of mount weather . Find a way to get on that radio and talk to us . Good luck . Octavia : Bell , how are you gonna- - I can get you through the tunnels . Octavia : He can 't go back there , not yet . Let me show you what to look for . Look . I have to . I need to face what i 've done . Then let 's face it together . No . You 're needed here . You know our ways . Without that , this alliance will fail . I won 't let that happen . I know you won 't . Love is weakness . Abby : Clarke ... This is for you . They 're ashes from the fire . I thought you could scatter them somewhere , Might help you say good-bye . I already said good-bye . [ wincing ] Uh ! [ crying ] Harper . Hey , harper , what did they do to you ? 47 . They built one for each of us . [ sobs ]

 ( WHIMPERS ) ( SCREAMS ) ( RUSSIAN ACCENT ) You may believe , Harry Clayton . But you haven 't learned how to control luck . Or how to mold it to your will . And now , it 's too late . Look him in the eye . Becker , look him in the eye when you kill him , or the bracelet will avenge him . If you 're trying to save him , you can 't . I have bullet in every chamber . Meet his eye or it will curse you . It will burn you . Believe . ( GUNSHOT ) ( VIDEO GAME GUNFIRE ) ( GUNSHOT ) Eve ? ( COUGHS ) ( GASPS ) ( WHIMPERS ) - HARRY : I should call this in . - You can 't do that , Harry . - I 'm a murder detective . - They 'll ask you why you 're here tied to a chair next to a dead man and a loaded gun . Are you going to tell them it 's because you 're wearing a lucky bracelet ? You go . Now . I 'll deal with this . - What ... He 's still alive . - EVE : Go ! But what about " ? ( PANTS ) God ... Oh , God . ( PHONE RINGS ) Good morning , Hoxton Ditch . Let me just check that for you . ( GASPS ) ( PHONE RINGS ) - Hello ? - SURI : Harry , where are you ? Where 've you been ? I 've been calling you all night . Did you catch him ? No , I was chasing him . I ... - I lost him by Tower Bridge . - Are you OK ? You sound weird . I 'm OK . I 've been at the hospital with Kate Olsen . She 's gone into an insulin coma . - Are you still there ? - Yeah , yeah . We 've been called to a shooting at the Hoxton Ditch . It 's a private members club . I 'll be there in 15 . 35 Curtain Lane . Harry ? ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) What happened ? The guy caught me by surprise . - Why didn 't you radio in ? - Didn 't have the chance . How long were you chasing the driver ? Quite a while , can 't be sure . You think he was the one holding Kate Olsen captive ? - Yeah , he must have been . - At least she 's still alive . Yeah , that 's good . Is this it ? KANE : Caleb Pursey , he owned this place . The shooter walks in wearing a mask , slips past the receptionist ... Shoots him three times in the chest . ( GUNFIRE ) Do we know who the shooter is ? All they 've got is dark hair and jeans . Probably white . And the next of kin ? Caleb 's wife 's already been notified . She heard the shots from upstairs . SURI : Mrs Pursey , do you know of anyone who might have wanted to kill your husband ? - Anyone who 'd been threatening him ? - No . Can you think of anything that could help us find the person who did this ? - I don 't know , I can 't ... - SURI : A name , or ... I don 't know anything . This is Finn Belman . Can you tell them what you saw ? I was behind the bar , but when he ran out , I saw something on his belt . I think it was a bottle opener from the Old Slaughter bar . MAN : Yeah , all the bar staff have these . I 've got six on the books at the moment . You 're actually in luck . They 're all here right now . Eh , privacy ? There 's two upstairs and three down here . There 's one missing . Where 's Tim ? - Well , he 's not here . - He 's supposed to be working . Which one 's his locker ? - Harry ! - I 've got a ... key . - HARRY : He 's a shit hit man . - Tim who ? Tim Larson . No , that 's fine . Thank you . Their address for Larson doesn 't work . He left there owing six months ' rent . Harry ? - Can you follow up ? I need to go . - Go where ? About last night , the hours you were missing . Where were you exactly ? I 've made a mistake . - I 've walked into something . - Why are you being so bloody weird ? - It 's a trap . - What have you done ? Trusted someone I don 't know . Eve ? Eve ? ( PHONE RINGS ) - Murder and violent crimes ? - Donna , Harry Clayton here . Listen , can you tell me , were any bodies brought in overnight ? - Possibly unidentified . - No , we had a quiet one for a change . Oh , apart from a woman in Edgware who killed her boyfriend . Just the usual . Thanks , Donna . HARRY : Paul Lermontov , good morning . - It 's alright . - DRIVER : Of course , sir . If you 're here about Kate Olsen , I have no new information . We found her . She 's alive . She 's going to make a full recovery . Good . What a relief . The man who kidnapped her used to work for your father . Yuri Becker . Do you remember him ? Yuri Becker ... No , I can 't say I do . Well , I 'm sorry but he didn 't manage to kill me or Olsen . Sorry , you 're losing me . You 're saying this Yuri Becker was trying to kill you as well ? Olsen discovered who your father really was , before he became such a ... lucky man . That 's why she needed to be killed . I 'm going to connect you to it . - I don 't think I 'm quite following you . - Have you ever played Russian roulette ? I heard your father was fond of it . There 's nothing quite like having a loaded gun pressed against your temple . It clears the mind . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR SLAMS ) - Morning , DS Chohan . - Hi . I 've found an address for Tim Larson . His girlfriend declared them homeless to the council three months ago . She told them he 's a gambling addict . Shall we ? Of course he is . It 's the worst part about being with an addict . It 's not about the things they 've lost . It 's the fear of what they 're going to do next . WOMAN : And he 's done it . SURI : Carmen , do you have any idea where Tim is now ? I heard him on the phone talking about some game where you don 't need money . Where anything 's up for grabs . ( LAUGHS WEAKLY ) We 've nothing left , so God knows what he 's playing with . Did he say where this place might be ? Carmen , do you have any idea why Tim might have wanted to kill Caleb Pursey ? - He must have owed him money . - HARRY : How do you know ? ( SIGHS ) Someone pushed this under the door two days ago . HARRY : Someone 's been watching you . It seems the Hoxton Ditch is a casino . Somethings not right . What if Tim Larson wasn 't killing the person he owed money to ? What if he was killing for the person he owed money too ? Harry , is this too close to home ? Because if it is , you should walk away now . No . I 'm fine . This is the next step . Caleb didn 't send these . This isn 't who he was . What about these ? Who has access to these chips ? Anyone who plays here . Did you or Caleb know this man ? He 's called Tim Larson . He may have owed Caleb money from gambling . No . I don 't know . Could you show us where the casino is ? What 's the minimum bet in here ? Ask him . He ran it for Caleb . MAN : Minimum bet 1,000 . 2,000 to get in . Tim Larson couldn 't afford to play here . Come on . Thank you . SURI : Just give me a second , Harry . Sir , can I show you a photograph of a customer who may have played here ? Do you recognize this man ? - Can I take your name please ? - Don Marianski . What are you doing here , Don ? It 's a crime scene . I let him in . I had work to do . Harry , that 's the guy that led me to the stacked table at the Green Dragon . He 's hooked up to Lily-Anne Lau . Contact Fraud . Find out what they know about him and any connection . Where are you going ? - To find Tim Larson . - Where ? - Places you don 't know . - I 'm coming with you . Suri . I 'm a gambler . The places I 'm going to , people know me . If you come with me , they 'll clam up . I wanted you to come back to Whitecross so I could show you what we would have offered Kevin Grey . In this restaurant we offer on-site training and rehabilitation , a job and reintegration on the outside . Except he killed himself . Which was a tragedy . And a failure on my pad . You want to show me you can do better . Why ? Because I know your work . You generally defend clients who , like Grey , come from pretty deep criminal backgrounds . Where we end up is usually dictated by where we start So I 've always felt I should try and level out the playing field . That 's why I wanted to bring you here . I want you to become a mentor for my outreach program . Where 's Harry ? Um , sir , I 've got Simon from Fraud coming in . Why ? Lily-Anne Lau and her probable money laundering . Sorry , you 've lost me . What 's this got to do with the Hoxton Ditch murder ? Last week this man , Don Marianski , won big on the stacked roulette table at the Green Dragon . I told Fraud and they 've had it under surveillance . Today I ran into him at the Hoxton Ditch running the gambling room . You think this guy might be pan of a money-laundering chain ? Yeah . From the Green Dragon to the Hoxton Ditch . Don Marianski recognized me so Fraud need to get in there before Lily-Anne Lau can cover her tracks . OK . Keep me posted . And find Harry . HARRY : Sorry , boys . You can 't keep winning , Harry . Your luck must run out some time . Here , have you heard of a place where people can gamble without using money ? ( SCOFFS ) Using what ? I don 't know . The son of place a major addict might go who needs a way out . - No . - I 'll tell you about that place . If you don 't play the next hand . ( LAUGHS ) You 're killing us here , man . - Do you know it ? - Is it a deal ? I 've heard about this game where no money 's exchanged . What do they bet with ? Whatever they 're prepared to lose . A man can walk in there with nothing , walk out with a Porsche , or not walk out at all . - They bet themselves ? - ( WHISPERS ) Sami ! There 's this Games Master . He levels out the stakes . I could bet my villa against your wife . Shut up , Sami . This is just an old wives ' tale , Harry . No . No , no , no , my cousin Magdalena has played in it . Tell me where it is . Good afternoon , madam . Our specials today are grilled sea bass with herb and raisin salsa and chermoula marinade and crushed puy lentils with tahini and cumin . Oh , sounds delicious . So how long have you been working here then ? Nearly six months now , madam . And you 're training to be a waiter when you leave ? We perform varied tasks in order to learn all aspects of the restaurant trade , including sous-chefing , waitering , and kitchen maintenance ... madam . Um , I 'm visiting because a client of mine was an inmate here , briefly . Kevin Grey ? Did you meet him ? He committed suicide , I expect you heard about ... Sorry about that . So ... Have you thought about my proposal ? Yes . Yes , I 'd love to be a mentor here . Sorry , I was just taking in another consignment . - More stolen treasures of Iraq ? - ( CHUCKLES ) No . Where 's Harry ? I came alone . I need to talk to someone who knows him . What 's wrong ? I 'm worried he 's losing his distance with the crimes we 're working on . Getting so close , he can 't see clearly anymore . - His work has always consumed him . - This is different . He keeps taking huge risks and it 's making him ... - A nightmare to work with ? - Yes , of course . But I was going to say unstable . Maybe even a little paranoid . ( LAUGHS ) You mean more paranoid than normal ? He went missing for 12 hours . I don 't know what happened , but when he came back he was acting weird . Has he said something to you ? About the gambling debts ? No . Then what 's happening to him ? RICH : Harry ... He 's always felt like God picked on him to play some ... twisted game with him . His twin died and he survived . Like , they were identical . That messes you up . RICH : And it 's always been there , hanging over him . And that 's where it all comes from . Harry 's constant need to test his luck . ( SIGHS ) - RICH : It 's like a ... - SURI : Death wish . - I 'm here for the game . - Code please . ( WHISPERS ) Six , two ... ( REPEATS UNDER HIS BREATH ) ... three , nine , eight . ( WHISPERS ) ... nine ... Shite . ( DOOR SLAMS ) What do you want ? I 'm here for the game . There is no game here . - You 're mistaken . - I don 't think so . As I said , you 've come to the wrong place . Magdalena told me about it . Magdalena ? Then she 'd have told you this month 's code . Six , two , three , nine ... weight . Your stake ? We must know what you are prepared to lose if you are to take pan in the game . Our establishment is a little more ... unorthodox than others . - ( KEYS JINGLE ) - BMW 507 Roadster . GAMES MASTER : And we are ready to begin . Place your hand in the opening . By coming here , you have all agreed to play the game to its conclusion , no matter what form that conclusion takes . Once the rat has chosen the winner , the game is over . ( WHISPERS ) Come on . No ... ( EXHALES ) All yours . Now to redeem your star prize ... ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) Please . No , Wait . ( STUTTERS ) - I 've got a kid . - What did he bet ? The price of admission was his tongue . No . No , no no . ( GASPS ) Listen , my kid is in danger . I just need money to save her and her mum . I just need to keep her safe . No . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) Give him to me . You can keep it all . You can even keep my car if you want . - He 's cheated us . They know each other . - I 've never met him before in my life . ( BREATHES HEAVILY ) Who told you to come here ? Wait , look . See this ? This is a ming-yun bracelet from the Tang Dynasty . Eighth century . It 's worth hundreds of thousands . - Too late to barter . - It is endowed with immense luck . Whoever wears it can control their own fortune . Let me see . I 'll bet you this bracelet , if you let me take him . ( GASPS ) GAMES MASTER : Bracelet on the table . It doesn 't come off . ( LAUGHS ) I 'm telling you . Believe me , try . It won 't ... come ... off . Well then , it 's useless . If you lose , how can we get the bracelet ? Wait . - Any way you can . - Do it . Roll a dice . Whoever wins gets the bracelet . If I win , I walk out of here with him - and you never see us again . - All agreed ? - Pick a number . - Doesn 't matter , you choose . - Five . - Four . - Six . - Two . Three . So I 'm one . TIM : Please . Please . ( PANTS ) - You could have lost your hand . - And you 're nicked . - No way , you 're not police . - Yes , I am . What kind of policeman does that ? Has that ? Oh , this old thing ? This is junk . No . No , I 've seen you use it . Why did you kill Caleb Pursey , huh ? I 've seen the blackmail photos . They weren 't from Caleb , were they ? OK , I ... I need a lawyer . SURI : Don Marianski . Does he ring any bells with you guys in Fraud ? We 've had our eyes on the Green Dragon , but I haven 't seen this guy come back . He may have used Lily-Anne Lau as a one-time cleaning service . Or he 's close to her and will warn her . No . We need more time . I don 't think you have it . Let me know when you go in . I want to be there . Suri , I 've got Tim Larson in Interview One . How did you find him ? I went to the worst casino in the world . You 're confessing to the murder of Caleb Pursey . TIM : Yes . You admit to walking into Hoxton Ditch and shooting him with a 9mm Glock handgun . Yes , I did that . My client hopes that his early confession and full cooperation ... Why did you kill Caleb Pursey ? - What ? - Who told you to do it ? No one . I killed him because I owed him a large amount of money , - and he threatened my family . - I don 't believe you . - Well , it 's the truth . - Come on , Tim . It costs £ 2,000 just to get through the door of the Hoxton Ditch Casino , so I don 't really believe you 've ever gambled there . Not a loser like you . - Did you even know Caleb Pursey ? - Yes . - Of course I did . - It was Lily-Anne Lau , wasn 't it , who employed you to kill Caleb Pursey ? No . I think you used to gamble regularly at the Green Dragon Casino and lost an enormous amount of money , until finally it was impossible to pay it back . And that 's when Lily-Anne really had you and your family . She had her sights on the Hoxton Ditch to expand her money-laundering operation . She used you to get rid of Caleb Pursey . You had no choice but to do as she asked . Can I remind you my client has already confessed to this murder ? How much do you owe her ? I 've got nothing more to say . Harry , you know you 've just torn apart his confession ? He didn 't owe Caleb Pursey money . So what do you have to connect Tim Larson to Lily-Anne Lau ? Don Marianski from the Hoxton Ditch who you saw in the Green Dragon . - It 's not enough . - WINTER : Suri ? Award ' ? Then I 'll get more . You 're joining Fraud when they raid the Green Dragon later ? Yes . And I suppose you know that Harry owes Lily-Anne Lau a lot of money . I 've heard that rumor . Interesting line of inquiry from Clayton . Is there any concrete evidence you 've found that would directly suggest Lily-Anne is linked to this murder ? No . So you think he 's trying to pin it on her for ... personal motives ? - That 's not what I 'm saying . - It has occurred to you ? - It doesn 't mean that ... - That he 's crooked ? Really ? ( SIGHS ) I 'm always here for you Suri . If you need to talk about anything . - You know that . - Hm-hmm . Don 't let him change you , Suri . You 're too good an officer for that . I 've got to get out of here . I can 't be here anymore , where he died . No , absolutely . I understand . I just came to tell you that we 've found your husband 's killer . And he 's made a full confession . That 's great . That 's a real relief . So why are you still scared ? ( INHALES DEEPLY ) I 'm not scared . Is it because Lily-Anne is still out there controlling everything you do ? I don 't know who Lily-Anne Lau is . Of course you don 't . Here 's what I think happened . The club got into money problems . Caleb used to hang with some gangster types , so he asked a favor . But then you both got in way over your heads . How am I doing ? And before you knew it , your secret casino became the perfect place - for washing Lily-Anne 's dirty money . - I made Caleb stand up to them . Tell them he was going to shut the casino . Lily-Anne still had her man in here ? And she didn 't want it to stop . That 's why they killed him . ( INDISTINCT CHATTER ) Cheers . This is a police raid , nobody move ! POLICEMAN : Keep your hands where I can see them . Come on . You 're under arrest , madam . Miss Lau . I found this underneath your roulette table . Do you know what it is ? I have no idea . - What is it ? - It 's a table rigging device . You found that here ? Have you arrested the croupier responsible for introducing this ? I 'm just incredibly grateful to your officers ... You never stop lying , do you ? Lily-Anne Lau , I am arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and money-laundering offenses under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 . ( PHONE RINGS ) - Hello ? - Harry ? You need to listen to me . It 's about your debt . - What ? - It 's been called in . Kaleem ? You asked me for proof that Harry Clayton is crooked . I have CCTV footage of him gambling at my casino the night my father was killed after he called in Harry 's debt . Yet Detective Clayton led that murder investigation . - Where 's the footage ? - Somewhere safe . Well , when can we have it ? I thought you wanted to help us bring Clayton down . Yes , I do . But not quite yet . KALEEM : Put some effort in , for God 's sake . You look like you 're doing the laundry . How much does she want ? Well , it 's not money anymore . You must return something that belongs to her . What ? Something that was taken from the casino last night . By your colleagues in Fraud . A mother-of-pearl lacquered box that belonged to her father . I can 't do that . It 's evidence . Its contents are very precious , Harry , and ... you owe her . She has some serious people behind her now who are very ... unsentimental in the way they work . What does that mean , Kaleem ? You 're a family man . KALEEM : Next ! So when is she going to give us this footage ? She may want to use it as a bargaining chip with us now Fraud have her in for money laundering . - Is she guilty ? - I don 't know . We may have to make a deal with the devil if we want Clayton . ( SIGHS ) For the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them . ( WHISPERS ) Make haste . Alright , Harry ? - Oh , hiya . - What can I do for you ? Yeah , I have a question . It 's a hangover from the investigation into the Freddie Lau murder . Shoot . How many roulette tables were stacked ? Only one . I 'll show you . - This one here wasn 't rigged ? - We just found one device . Alright ? SURI : Harry ? - I thought you 'd left for the evening . - Likewise . What 's that ? It 's a promissory note . Tim Larson owed Lily-Anne money . £ 110,000 . I think this is enough to prove she ordered the hit on Caleb Pursey . How did you find this ? You took this from Freud 's evidence room . We can nail Lily-Anne with this . I don 't know if I can trust you anymore . Suri , we 're both fighting on the same side . But the people we 're fighting don 't play fair , so , sometimes one of us has to fight dirty . Listen . You take it . You decide what we do with it . Lily-Anne Lau , I am further arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Caleb Pursey . - LILY-ANNE : Where 's your partner ? - You do not have to say anything . - I know you 're doing this for him . - I 'm doing it because you 're guilty . - Where 've you been ? - I 've been busy . - What did you do with Becker 's body ? - It 's safer if you don 't know . What , I 'll just accept that ? What other choices do you have ? - What 's that ? - I told you before that I knew you . You didn 't believe me . This is my mother 's murder case file . You were one of the detectives on it . My mother was Maria Alexandri . I shouldn 't have done this to you . I 'm sorry . Do they really have to look me in the eye when they kill me ? No , I just made that up . Get some sleep , Harry . ( DOOR CLOSES ) - What did he want ? - A package for the boss . I 'll take it to Winter .

 Previously on " Salvation " ... I 'm seeing someone . Harris Edwards . He 's got a son your age . - Gillian . - I quit my job . - And my boyfriend . - Laura and I are engaged . People have died . I think it has something to do with this . Project Atlas . You need to dig deeper . Find out where she got that photo . My friend Katya , the Russian ambassador . She said her country stole our EmDrive out of retribution for Atlas . The world 's about to catch fire and we may be the only ones who can stop it . - We 're going to Russia . - Does this photo have any meaning to you ? The U.S. created some sort of super weapon to destroy us . - Atlas is a weapons program ? - Except the weapon ... - was an asteroid . - Where did you get these ? Amanda Neel . Suspend Grace Barrows 's A4 security clearance . No , God . No . We 're gonna be arrested for her murder if we don 't move fast . - Give me your passport . - Without our papers , we 're nobody . That 's exactly who we have to be if we want to get out of here alive . This is not just some rebellion , Dad . I 'm actually trying to save the world . Liam Cole . Welcome to RE / SYST . You know everything about us . I don 't even know your names . Whatwhat is this ? Is ... are you Trinity ? That 's Neo over there . You must be Morpheus . What you call us isn 't important . What you know is . We want answers , Liam . That makes two of us . I mean , RE / SYST is all about free information , right ? So why don 't you throw something my way ? Where 'd you get this photo ? And why 'd you give it to Amanda Neel , of all people ? Amanda was the only reporter looking into what happened to this man , Walter Carnahan . Pentagon sattech . A founding member of RE / SYST . The founder of RE / SYST ... is a Pentagon employee ? With highlevel clearance ? So much for national security . Carnahan was a patriot ! He believed that government secrets were the enemy of democracy , and so do we . He stumbled across this government program called Atlas . The next day , he was murdered . What , so you think someone in the government put a hit on your friend ? And I 'm gonna find out who it is with your help . No . Tanz is the key to all of this . - We need access ! - Look , I am sorry about your friend , but I do not know anything about Atlas , - and neither does Darius . - Really ? Well , how do you explain this ? The FSB issued this internal memo , which RE / SYST accessed through their network . FSB ? What , the Russian Secret Police ? What does it say ? There 's a manhunt for Darius Tanz and Grace Barrows in Moscow . They 're wanted for murder . What ? Can I interest you in souvenir ? We 're interested in a copy of War and Peace . Everything you need is in here . Dmitry . And Irina Petrovic . So , we 're married ? Hopefully , you two are good actors , yes ? You 're gonna break my stool . - What ? - Keep sitting there with the weight of the world on your shoulders , you 're gonna break my stool . Work ? A woman ? Little of both . I have to make a choice between ... one or the other . Okay , then . That kind of trouble deserves a double . Thanks . So ... that 's it ? No sage advice ? No . The guy that offers sage advice works Tuesday , Thursday , 2 : 00 to 10 : 00 . Just my luck . All right , well , my shift 's up , so I 'm closing out . Good luck ... with that choice . Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over ... it became a butterfly . I 'm sorry ? You wanted sage advice . I 'll remember that . Liam , you have an incoming call from an unknown Moscow landline . Put it through , Tess . Hello . Liam ? What the hell is going on ? You 're wanted for murder . We don 't have much time . The EmDrive ? Done . Fully functional . - Have you told anyone ? - Not yet . But you 're making progress , right ? With the Russian government ? Liam , with a little luck , we just might make it out of here in one piece , and if we don 't ... you 're gonna need to make decisions . About ? Everything . The Ark ... we need to accelerate the 160 selection . Do you understand ? Yeah . Yeah , I understand . Goodbye , Liam . Yeah . Bye . We 're Dmitry and Irina Petrovic . I 'm a high school physics teacher , you 're an engineer . We 've been married 12 years . But only four of them were happy . What 's wrong ? Other than ... everything ? We 've come all this way and haven 't even had a chance to make our case . I mean , if we leave , what hope 's left ? Our only contact was murdered , and we 're the prime suspects . If you have another idea , I 'm all ears . Apologies , Mrs. Petrovic . FSB agents . A little warning next time . Darius Tanz . Darius , they recognize you . Once that photo hits the web , we 're geotagged . Everyone will know where we are . I don 't see how we get out of here without getting picked up , no matter how many times you kiss me . Grace , I 'm afraid the only way out is ... In . I 'm Darius Tanz . This is Grace Barrows . Darius ... Once I confirmed that my private access codes had been compromised , I had no choice but to have Grace Barrows' A4 security clearance revoked . And you have reason to believe she and Darius Tanz are currently in Russia ? Moscow , sir . Yes . I have it on good authority . If that 's the case , I 'm afraid they 're on their own . Wait . Sir ? Harris , we 're at DEFCON 2 for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis . If I recommend an exfil mission , and it were to go sideways , it would mean World War III . Look , by no means am I defending what Grace did , but since when did we , the United States government , adopt such a laissezfaire attitude towards getting our people out of hot spots ? This isn 't some third world sand dune . It 's Moscow . We are talking about a global superpower whose missile silos are currently open , ready for war . Tanz and Barrows both knew that they were putting themselves in harm 's way . It 's not up to us to save their asses , Harris . We 've got the rest of the world to think about . Now you wait . This is an Airbnb fail . Are those ... bloodstained bullet holes ? - Probably . - Maybe we should ask for an upgrade . We only drove for about 40 minutes . We can 't be too far outside the city . - Remember , everything we say in here ... - They 're listening . Welcome to Moscow . You 're not dead . Thanks to the skill of some excellent Russian doctors . You son of a bitch ! Darius ! You worthless piece of ... You murdered my friend ! Yeah . Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm sorry about Lazlo , but I had no choice . But we 're not here to rehash the past . We 're here to discuss the future . That 's why you risked everything to come here , right ? So we could broker some sort of peace . The Russian ambassador was going to arrange a meeting with your defense minister until she was killed . Unfortunately , she threatened to go public when she learned about the asteroid . If our governments have anything in common , it 's a desire to keep this one particular secret ... a secret . We didn 't turn ourselves in to negotiate with a traitor . I am the reason that you 're still here , Darius . I am the one that convinced . Defense Minister Toporov that you 're worth more alive than dead . Yeah , so we can take the blame for Katya 's murder ? No . So you can end this impasse . Our EmDrive is a prototype . And we 've had trouble constructing a fullscale model without Tanz 's resources . Bring out the violins . We have a gravity tractor , but we have no way - of getting it to the asteroid in time . - And we have an EmDrive , but no way of launching it without the Russians shooting it down . Exactly , so ... If you 're willing to discuss these matters with the minister of defense , I can arrange that . Why should we believe a word that comes out of this monster 's mouth ? ! Well ... frankly , what choice do you have ? Dylan . I 've done a deep dive on Zoe Barrows . What 's her deal ? The usual social media accounts . Not a lot of followers . Photos of her prom and graduation . Total bore fest . She friended me . Our parents are dating . So , what are you gonna do ? What friends do . - Mason , right ? - Yeah . Yeah . I 'ml 'm Liam Cole , Darius 's right hand . He asked me to check in on the status of the 160 project . The status is that I 'm about to fire that entire staff . Okay , but you 've narrowed down the candidates , right ? Yes , of course . We have one exceptional candidate . One . We 're still pouring over the other options , but Darius put in place this ridiculous restriction where we all have to agree before anyone is selected . And clearly , with these troglodytes upstairs , that 's not happening . Where is Darius , anyway ? He 's out of town . He 's on business . Well , when he returns , we need to make some serious changes . Karissa , Karissa . I , um , can 't believe I 'm asking this , but is the helicopter available ? Yes . Where are you going ? Boston . Wow . I don 't know how the hell you pulled all this together . Do you have a final head count ? Grand total , 37 people . I invited someone , as well , who has RSVP 'd . Yeah ? - The MIT guy ? - No . Grandpa . Traffic was apocalyptic . Where 's the bar ? Minister Toporov , this is Grace Barrows , she 's the press secretary for the Pentagon . And the famous Darius Tanz . Or should I say " infamous " ? I 've been called worse . A lot worse , actually . Please . Do you know what 's the most valuable commodity in the world these days ? Not oil . Not gold , diamonds . It 's trust . Can the United States of America and Russia ever learn to trust each other after all that happened ? I assure you , the only enemy the Russian people have is the same enemy we have ... that asteroid closing in on all of us . If we are to trust you , Mr. Tanz , Ms. Barrows , you 'll have to prove you 're worthy of that trust . Sugar ? No , thanks . I take my polonium straight up , like a man . Okay . My proposal is simple . Drink tea , gain trust . The only way to know if you can really trust someone is to trust them and ... find out . Cheers . I told you they could be trusted . I agree . I agree . You , on the other hand , Professor Croft , not so sure . Wait , wait . What are you doing ? Wh ... if it wasn 't for me , you wouldn 't have the EmDrive . I still don 't have it , thanks to your ineptitude . Yeah . Darius . Tell Liam ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Now , we talk . About six months ago , some school children in Chelyabinsk came across this unusual rock . It looks like a piece of my tech fused to some sort of rock . By the time we pieced together what happened , we had bigger fish to fry , as you say . The threat ... from space . What 's happening ? Darius , something 's wrong . The tea . What have you done to us ? Mr. Tanz , Ms. Barrows , relax . I can assure you the tea is not gonna kill you , but it will force you to tell the truth . Sodium Pentothal . No , no . It 's called SP117 . Highly reliable , very few side effects . You are feeling uninhibited . Like if you mixed a muscle relaxant with , your favorite cocktail . Sorry I had to take this precaution , but the fate of the world is at stake . No margin for error . So , how is it ... Mr. Tanz . Mr. Tanz . How is it that your technology appeared in this rock ? I had nothing to do with Project Atlas . My tech was misappropriated in order to weaponize that asteroid that hit Chelyabinsk . This stuff makes you feel chatty . What is it that you want ? A joint effort with the United States and Russia . Darius has a fullscale . EmDrive ready to go , and we 're just gonna get it up there , and we 're gonna save the world . And then we can go back to hating each other and not doing anything about it . So , you are saying this is not a ruse to weaponize the asteroid and destroy my country . No , no . Which is why I 'm proposing Russian oversight as insurance . Send your scientists , politicians ... hell , send your president if he 'll go . And we 'll launch this thing together . If we can put aside our past and our politics , we can avert disaster . I will present your proposal to the Federation . And the president . Hold , wait , wait , wait . Hold , please . When is this stuff gonna wear off ? A few hours . You will barely remember a thing . Enjoy . So , my granddaughter , who despises me , calls me out of the blue to make peace in the family . Okay ... selfish request . I 'm writing a story , and I need some help . I thought we discussed this . Cashing in on my name - is just not allowed . - No . I already have a publisher that 's interested , and they have no idea that I am the granddaughter of the great Andre Bartok , author of The 360 . I 'm just having trouble with the main character . Well , imagine that . The author of ShadowSide needs my advice . God . Mom was right . You really just can 't be nice , can you ? Nice is overrated . So ... the question . What is the question ? If my lead character has a secret ... that the world may come to an end ... what is her responsibility to the people around her ? Does she tell them so they can make choices on how they spend their last days ? Or does she keep the secret to herself so she doesn 't destroy whatever happiness is left in the world ? What kind of a person is she ? What makes her tick ? She 's decent . She likes to think she is , and she wants to do the right thing . People are not , you know , innately good . They don 't want to do the right thing . They want to do the wrong thing , but society confines them . This was a terrible idea . I 'm sorry I even brought it up . The POTUS wants to know where things stand . According to our calculations , Samson will cross the Rubicon Line in five days . If we don 't launch our gravity tractor before then , it won 't be able to reach the asteroid in time to deflect it . Then we have to find a way to launch in five days - without Russian interference . - Cape Canaveral 's the ideal location . Unfortunately , thermal imaging shows what we believe are Russian nuclear subs off the coast of Florida , in international waters . They 're in optimal firing position . If we arm our rocket with IR flares and activate every Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile , we may stand a chance . And if we do that , what are the odds our rocket makes it through ? At best , 5050 . I 'm not willing to bet the fate of the planet on a coin toss . Unless the Russians decide to stand down and let us launch this damn thing , we may have to . Russia conducted a test of a banned cruise missile this morning in brazen violation of several nuclear treaties . At the same time , the Russian embassy shuddered its doors ... - Dylan . - Zoe . Come on in . What if they never let us out ? What if this is how we die , in a seedy flat in Moscow ? They 've got some great LPs here . Care to listen to some music before you die ? Just said I don 't want to die here . I can 't change what happens , all right ? But I can change the ambience . This is so beautiful . I love Ella Fitzgerald . Me , too . What will you miss , Grace ? Most of all . If the world ends ? I die here ? Yes . Zoe . Her laugh . Her smile . Cherry blossoms . Spring . Springsteen . Love . Not love songs . Sex . The good kind . Is there a bad kind ? Please . My marriage . Did I just say that out loud ? What about you ? What will you miss ? All the stuff they 're defunding . Music , art , literature , dancing . Dancing ? What ? Really ? You just don 't strike me as the type , the romantic type . That 's all . I happen to be quite romantic when the right woman comes along . Or even the wrong one , for that matter . I have your number . I do . You just make everyone feel like they 're the one . They are . In the moment . This can 't be it , Darius . It just can 't . Grace . I 'm sorry . I ... I dragged you here . II dragged you into everything . No . No , I dragged myself . No regrets , okay ? At least I know I did everything I could to save this ... dumb-ass planet . It is pretty dumb-ass . Do you really like dancing ? Me , too . You were right . You are good at this . I like this Darius . Dancing Darius . And I like you , Grace . Ever since I saw you at the Croatian embassy . You kissed me today . The train station . I 'm sorry . I should have asked permission . Permission granted . For then ? Or now ? Both . If you tell me to stop , I will . What if I don 't ? So , our parents are dating . For how long ? I don 't know . At least a year , I think . She would kill me if she knew I reached out . She 's so secretive . Tell me about it . My dad is a vault . So , where is your mom right now ? Some business trip with Darius Tanz . Any idea what they 're working on ? She doesn 't tell me anything . For all I know , she 's in the CIA or something . It 's nice . Meeting someone that understands what it 's like to grow up feeling like you don 't really know your mom . Or your dad . It 's so lonely . I hate it . Me , too . Thank you ... for pulling all this together . You deserve to be happy , Dad . So do you . I get a feeling that you want to tell me something . You know you can talk to me , right ? About anything . I know . Who 's that ? A friend . Can you excuse me a second ? Yeah . What are you doing ? You can 't just show up here . I know , but you wouldn 't answer any of my calls , any of my texts . Look , forget about us for a second . The Ark Project needs you . That guy Mason , he can 't get it done . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry if I made the wrong choices . But therethere 's no blueprint for what is happening to us right now . Look , all I know is you inspired me to try to save the world . And ... I want to do the same . Liam ... I don 't have what it takes to go back there . To Tanz . I 'm sorry . This is where I belong . Well ... Before I go ... maybe one dance ? For old times ' sake . If I didn 't know any better , I 'd say your daughter was in love . Then why does she look so damn sad ? Grace . Mr. Tanz . Ms. Barrows . I presented your proposal to my government . It has been accepted . When you return to the United States , have your defense secretary reach out to me to arrange the details . Thank you , Minister Toporov . I 'll see to it . Yes . Um ... And yours , Mr. Tanz . Ms. Barrows . Harris . Tanz 's plane has made contact . Grace and Darius have been released . - They 're on their way back . - When are they due to land ? Five hours . Zoe ? Mom ? Hi . Harris ? - That won 't be necessary . - What 's going on ? Grace Barrows , you 're under arrest . What ? For violation of the Logan Act . Conducting unauthorized negotiations with a hostile foreign government . - Let 's go . - No . Honey , it 's just a misunderstanding . Go to your father 's until you hear from me , okay ? It 's okay . And call Darius Tanz . Now . So ... Jillian , youryour question , are you still looking for an answer ? I 'm not really in the mood to be mocked right now , Granddad . Ignorance is bliss , that 's what I say . What ? Since when do you adhere to bumper sticker philosophy ? Since I saw that look on your face yesterday . I don 't know what you know , but if it 's gonna cause the kind of heartache I saw in your face ... the world has enough heartache right now , don 't you think ? When your mother was sick , the doctors told her she had six months to live . But she lost all hope and she only lasted three . That boy , whoever he is ... he gives you hope . Happiness is fleeting . Grab it like a firefly . Never let it go . The lies never stop with you , do they ? - That 's not fair . - You went behind my back to Russia with Darius . What did you think you 'd accomplish ? Something no one else here could , obviously . Diplomacy , and we did . Yeah , that 's right . You and Darius Tanz saving the world from us evil government shills . Where is this coming from ? Why don 't I lay it out for you ... one earring at a time . Yeah . You broke into my briefcase , stole my nuclear access codes . What exactly were you doing with four barrels of enriched uranium , Grace ? Nothing ... compared to what you did in Chelyabinsk . N ... it was a mistake . A weapons test that went wrong . That asteroid was supposed to land in uninhabited terrain , - but it went off course . - Our government developed a weapon of mass destruction designed to have no fingerprints , no accountability . - And that doesn 't disturb you ? - No one died there , Grace . No . But how many people were killed to cover it up ? You still can 't answer that . Or won 't . I can 't help you anymore , Grace . Frankly , I 'm not sure I want to . - Sir . - Hold all my calls . But , sir ... Get the hell out of my office or I 'll have you thrown out . Where 's Grace ? Whwhat have you done with her ? - She 's been arrested . - For what ? Saving your incompetent asses ? She violated the Logan Act , conducting foreign relations - without authority . - The Logan Act ? AAn obscure law that 's never been used to prosecute anyone , including me , strangely . What you do as a private citizen is not my business . Grace is a government employee who exceeded her authority . You petty son of a bitch . This is personal , and we both know it . She 's become a completely different person since she met you . Yes . Courageous , bold , passionate . Everything you 're not , thankfully . Go on , do it . Just get the hell out of here . Go ! Before I do something I 'll regret . I imagine you already have . If you don 't release Grace , I 'll go to the press . Tell them everything ... asteroid , Atlas , and that 's just the " A " s . I 'll burn it all down , Harris . And don 't get any ideas about black site prisons and the like . I 've got a dozen lawyers standing by with my sworn statement in their hands . If I disappear , they 've been instructed to release it immediately . You 've got ten minutes before I go nuclear . Yes , we anticipate your team 's arrival . Speaking for everyone here at the Pentagon , we look forward to the glasnost between our two countries . I assume that was the Russian defense minister . Yes . They 're standing down . - Closing their silos ? - And their subs have been ordered to retreat from the Florida peninsula . Darius has threatened to go public with all of it if we don 't release Grace Barrows . Well , the Russians say there 's no deal unless Grace and Darius run point on this operation . Seems they 're the only ones the Russians trust . And the only ones we don 't . Hey . I didn 't expect to see you back so soon . How 'd it go ... your choice ? It went . That sounds like another double . - It 's last call . - Thanks , but ... I didn 't come for the bourbon . I came for the company . Well , I 'm ... really good company . Hey . You 're back . Two conditions . First ... I 'm gonna lead the room . Done . And the other thing ? I want to know what I 'm really working on . It 's almost done . All that 's left is ... - Are the people ? - Yeah . The 160 . Here 's hoping we never need it . I couldn 't do it , either , Liam . I couldn 't tell my father or any of them the truth . And I understand ... how much you must ... love me ... to have kept that secret . Zoe ? Well , her car 's not outside , so ... Thank you for getting me out . We did good . We accomplished what our own government couldn 't . How am I supposed to ever go back there ? I mean , after everything that 's happened . You have to . Until we see this through . Just ... just focus on the ultimate goal , and , and ... take emotion out of the equation . If only it were that simple . A good evening to you , Mrs. Petrovic . And to you , Mr. Petrovic . And remember ... But ... only if you want it to .

 I mean , everyone wants to believe they 'd be the hero , that they 'd join the Resistance , try to kill Hitler . It 's such fucking bullshit . It 's obedience , not resistance . That 's the glue of every country , every army , every religion in the world . The fuck are you talking about , Felix ? What do you think ? I 'm talking about us . - I 'm talking about our revolution . - We snatched some rocks . Mark my words , Wolfie , this score is going to change our lives . Not gonna change shit if we can 't sell them . He 's going to buy . Just relax . Let me do the talking . - Thank you for waiting . - ( Felix ) Not a problem . It 's nice here , but you know there 's a bigger one in Mettre ? - That one smells like piss . - ( Felix chuckles ) The drunks from the park use it as a toilet . I like this one better . Whenever I have a difficult decision to make , I come here . This place brings a clarity to any decision . - What were you thinking about ? - My mother . - Did she die in the Holocaust ? - No , she lived . She fell in love with an Englishman and ran away with him against her parents ' wishes . I think how much courage she had to make that decision . After the war , she came back to find her parents , but she never did . - And she never left Berlin again . - Mm . Our existence depends on sheer implausibility , which I 'm sure is exactly how your merchandise found its way into your pocket . Does that mean you 're interested ? I would like to see them . Please , not here . Any talk of money seems unimportant here . ( man ) We never discuss money . We have no interest in money . All we are interested in is making sure that you and your son ... - And your daughter . - ... are happy . OK , then we are all in accordance with- - Not exactly . Ah . We have spoken to the priest , uh , - concerning the , uh- - - Adjustment to the service . Uh , this is my fault . I wanted to add an exchange of rings . Ah , this is a Hindu wedding ceremony . There are no rings . - I know . - ( man ) There are traditions . Yes , but we are trying to start them on a path to the 21st century , - not the 16th . - Of course . And the priest is ready to accommodate . It 's just that with both services , it appears the ceremony- - - Will be over six hours . - Six hours ? There are certain shortcuts that others have preferred . How short ? It depends entirely on how much you value the priest conducting it . How much ? The more you give him , the shorter the ceremony . The sooner everyone can get to dancing . Six hours is the starting point . Pay him double , out in three . And how much to not perform it at all ? - You couldn 't afford it . ( snorting ) - ( giggling ) ( sighs ) ( Rajan ) This is important to me . Married men in India don 't wear rings . There is nothing to show their commitment . That is why I want one . I want to remember this night for the rest of my life , and I don 't want it to be a secret . I want the whole world to know I 'm bound to this woman . Now and forever . ( grunts softly ) ( sighs ) ( mother ) I 'm so proud of you . So smart and so strong . Is that why my father hates me ? He doesn 't hate you , my child . You must never think that . - He loves you . - He never came to any of my matches . He went to all of Joong-Ki 's matches . You cannot be jealous of your brother . Do not blame him for how much Father loves him . It is natural for fathers to be close to their sons . He 's planning on Joong-Ki taking over the company . If I cannot be there to help Father realize his dream ... you must be there for me . Please , Sun , take care of your brother . Do this for me . ( man ) We , like these books , or these diamonds , have the secrets of our past hidden inside us . You think a lot about the past , don 't you ? Without the past , there would be nothing to think about , let alone someone to think it . Deep . You certainly weren 't lying . These are beauties . Shall I be honest ? I know I was probably the last on your list . I 'm an outsider to you , but I think I know where these rocks came from . Out of Mumbai , I 'm guessing , and I know who 's going to come looking for them . They will not be easy to move , unless I recut them . Recut , they will have a fraction of their worth . Let 's go , Felix . I knew this was a waste of time . Hang on . Really ? After we listened to all your bullshit ? If you were listening to my bullshit , I said it would not be easy . I didn 't say it would not be possible . I will buy a third of them and see what I can do . Half or nothing . And we both know that you 're going to say yes , because I was listening . That 's what your mother would do . ( sighs ) I 'm such a bad person . You spend all your money on my medicine . - Don 't talk like that . - You would be a success without me . - You would not have to live here . - Not listening . If I wasn 't such a bad person , I 'd stop taking my medicine and let you get on with your life . This is my life . This is why we came here . To make money , to be happy , to be healthy . Besides , when I iron my shirt , it always burns up . Without you , I would go into the world naked . There 's still some water left . I will try and bring some back before I come home . I love you . And don 't worry . I 've got a feeling today is going to be a really good day . Huh ? ( overlapping chatter ) Hey ! ( speaks Swahili ) Ah ! All aboard the Van Damn , the safest bus in and out of Nai-robbery ! ( all cheering ) ( speaks Swahili ) - Eh ? - ( chatter in Swahili ) The fuck are you doing ? I 'm thinking about Katrina Unger . - What ? - Remember ? The first time I got my dick wet . She was 16 , I was 14 . I 'd been dating her for two months , which back then seemed like a fucking lifetime , and I remember thinking I 'd been wasting my time . Buying her presents , taking her to the movies . ( mailbox clatters ) But then ... the second I got myself inside of her ... ( sighs ) everything ... everything had been worth it . Hm ? - Know what I did ? - What ? I went out and bought myself a new pair of shoes . ( giggles ) Had to . I couldn 't walk in those old shoes anymore . From that point on , everything changed . I mean , I had changed . I was a man ! ( unzips bag ) ( cheering ) ( up-tempo jazz plays ) And right now , I 'm thinking ... we need new shoes . ( Jela ) Whoo ! ( whistling ) This is it , Capheus ! You 'll never hear me complain about success , Capheus , never ! - Never ! - My ancestors would haunt me if I even thought to complain about having too many passengers . - Whoo ! - Don 't complain , Jela . - ( Jela ) Whoo ! - ( chuckles ) ( whistles ) Whoo ! Whoo-hoo ! ( whistling ) Whoo ! Whoo ! Oh , those are my- - Those are my ancestors reminding me to be grateful , even when I 'm being whipped on the face ! - Whoo ! ( whistles ) - You are crazy . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Oh , crap . You made sure we had all the permits , eh ? Yeah , we are in total compliance . Don 't worry , it will be over in a minute . Good day , officers . I 'm sure you 'd like to see- - - Shut the fuck up . - Oh , happy to . Love to . You know what ? Shutting the fuck up is a specialty of mine , so- - We want Van Damme . Out . Out , out , out , out . - ( speaks Swahili ) - Shut up . - Follow me . - I don 't understand , sir . - Follow me . - ( speaks Swahili ) ( people chattering ) Guys , come on . It seems he 's not coming back . Van Damme always comes back . ( Capheus speaks indistinctly ) Daniella , I don 't think you both were listening to me . What I 'm saying is that he came to the set . - ( scoffs ) He came to the fucking set . - The director says he knows him . Yes , he did . And what did he say about him ? He said he was a great guy . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry , Lito . That doesn 't sound like something he would do . Well , he did . He did . I 'm telling you , Daniella , over lunch ... he showed me how to cut a man 's throat . He put a knife on my throat . Now that sounds like something he would do . - But now you 're home , OK ? - You should have told me . Taste the ceviche . Daniella- - Good . - You 're an actor . - Good ? You understand that this , you know , set , is- - - It 's a sacred space ? - Yes , exactly . - I thought home was your sacred space . - It is , Hernando . But this is where I work and it 's very difficult to concentrate when you have a knife-wielding psycho ex-lover stalking you . - You know , guys ? - Oh , my God . Yeah , I mean , it completely freaked me out . Oh , my God , this is so good . That 's the best ceviche I 've ever tasted . Oy , Hernando , you have to open a restaurant . Thank you . I mean , you are such a good cook . - ( Hernando ) I 'm gonna tell you my secret . - It 's very tasty . Actually , this is not , uh , ceviche . This is actually a mix . - ( chuckles ) - So , here they are . Yeah , great . - Um ... and I really like those ones , 42 . - Mm-hm . Und , do you have them in yellow , something more colorful ? - Yeah , for sure . - Oh , great . Wow . ( laughs ) Those are so you , Wolfie . Maybe too you . You should try something ... a little different . ( scoffs ) I like my shoes . What the fuck ? - ( groans ) - ( Felix ) What ? ( no audible dialogue ) ( man ) I have seen you before . - You pray to Ganesha . - I do . If these men are allowed to have their way , you will never be allowed to pray again . What ? They want to strip away our traditions . They are trying to destroy our India and turn it into America . - No , that- - That 's not true . - It is . These are the facts . They use their evil drug money to buy politicians , who are going to outlaw people like us and temples like this . We are pledged to come here every day and pray for their deaths . Pray with us . Pray to Ganesha to destroy our enemy before they destroy us . So this is the notorious Van Damme . I 'm Silas Kabaka . I know who you are . Our reputations precede us . You did me a great service , though you may not even know it . You see , the gang Superpower had been working for me . They got it in their heads they no longer needed me , and in one afternoon , you destroyed whatever reputation they felt they 'd been building , thereby saving me from the incumbent messiness of betrayal . So I said to myself , here is a man that might be capable of more service to someone like me . Service that provides the kind of remuneration that can change a man 's life . Thanks for the offer , but I 'm OK . You may be OK ... but I know this is not true for your mother . We both know that she is dying of the virus . Unless she gets the right medication , she 'll soon be dead . You know the problem with buying medicine in this country is that you never know if what you 're buying is real ... or counterfeit . The doctors assure me that these will have an immediate impact on your mother 's health . What do I have to do for them ? All you need to do is protect this bag and make sure it arrives at this address by midnight tonight . Should be a rather simple task for a man of your abilities , no ? ( father ) What are you doing hiding in the dark ? Waiting for you . I know you 've been avoiding me . Your outburst in front of my assistant was childish . I needed to get your attention . I have been here every night , negotiating a very important deal with the Americans . Put the cigarette out . You know I hate it when you smoke . You 're too late . The auditors already know . Someone in this company has been deliberately devaluing certain pharmaceutical stock in order to move funds from one account to another . This kind of transaction happens every day . That may be ... but this kind of transaction is called embezzlement . Someone is going to jail for it . And I think we both know who . ( classical piano playing ) We want the most expensive wine you have . - Felix . - We have an amazing Bordeaux . Is it the most expensive ? - Yes , I believe it is . - Then we 'll take it . One time , just one night , I want to live like I 'm one of them Arab sheiks or Russian billionaires . Tonight , I don 't want to be just Felix Bernner . Tonight , I say , no fucking limits ! Hey . You all right ? Yeah , sure . ( laughs ) ( Dr. Metzger ) I know what you 're going through , Nomi . In just the span of a single day , you can see how much more damage the disease has done . The tissue has nearly completely merged the hemispheres . I 'm sure the hallucinations are getting more and more intense . And I have a feeling that you know who started that fire . I don 't know anything about that . Whoever they are , they aren 't helping you . I don 't know what they taught you in med school , but the word " helping " doesn 't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains . Michael ! ( sighs ) Nurse , I was gonna operate tomorrow morning , but I don 't think Ms. Marks here can afford to wait . No , no , no , no . No , I 'm fine . I can wait . Cancel my rounds . Prep her for surgery . ( woman ) Yes , doctor . Sorry , lady , this is a private club . I don 't want to cause a scene . I know this is a sex club . No chicks but naked chicks . My brother 's in there and I need him to come with me . Ain 't gonna happen . Fuck off . ( cries out ) ( grunting ) ( ♪ Lykke Li : " Get Some " ) ( no audible dialogue ) ( man ) Hey , you OK ? You can wait here , Officer Gorski . I 'll go get Lieutenant Duncan . ( overlapping chatter ) ( loud chattering ) ( women ) Whoo ! ( chatter stops ) Come with me . ( scoffs ) It 's OK . This is my big sister , everyone . - ( man 1 ) Hi . - ( man 2 ) Hi , sister . ( Joong-Ki ) She doesn 't mean to make an ass out of herself . She just can 't seem to help it . ( chuckles ) Father needs to talk to you . Are you fucking kidding ? - I 'll see him tomorrow . - No . He 's waiting . - In the middle of something important- - - Joong-Ki ! ( thudding ) Now . ( man laughing ) Will ! So good to see you . Did you have to wait long ? ( speaks in Korean ) No , no . It 's good to see you . I didn 't know you spoke Korean . What ? ( speaks in Korean ) You honor us with your presence . ( continues in Korean ) Though your wife is a cock sucking whore . ( chortles ) Hapkido . Black belt . Thirteen years . My sensei had the foulest mouth in the entire Midwest . - How 's your dad ? - He 's doin ' good . I haven 't seen him since the retirement party . I don 't think I 've ever seen so many shitfaced cops from so many precincts in one bar . Your dad was a legend . Is . Is a legend . Sorry , Will . So , uh , what can I do you for ? Uh , it 's about that perp I brought in , Jonas Maliki . What about him ? Was just hoping I could ask him a few questions . Ah , sorry , Will , no can do . It 's federal . You know how those guys are . We 're only holding ' him here until he 's transferred . You should 've called first . It would 've saved you a trip . All I need is five minutes with him . Family friend here . This is a personal favor . This look like a place that gives a shit about personal favors ? I 'm sorry , Will , but rules are rules . Give my best to your dad . I 'll send Greg to take you out . Damn it ! ( Jonas ) Will . You 're here . - I can feel you . - Yes , you can . But you 're not really here , are you ? No . I 'm in solitary confinement . Angel called it " visiting . " Members of a cluster do it instinctively and others , like us , outside the cluster , can visit if they 've made visual contact , eye-to-eye . This is cold . How can I feel this unless I 'm here ? Because I feel it . No , this doesn 't make sense . - You just spoke Korean , Will . - I can 't speak Korean . Yes , you can , and when you get it , you will . Get what ? You are no longer just you . Mr. Gorski ? Will you come with me , please ? ( Joong-Ki ) OK . ( chuckles ) It was so dramatic , Dad . Sun made an absolute spectacle of herself . - Really embarrassed me and- - - ( father ) Shut the hell up ! Do you have no idea what you have done ? What are you talking about ? Do you think I am so stupid that I don 't know when someone is stealing from me ? Stealing from my clients ? ! Tomorrow the authorities are going to come here and confiscate our records . And your face , the face of our company ... will be in every newspaper , on every news program , and everything I have built over the past 40 years will be gone . ( softly ) Do you understand ? ( shouts ) Do you understand ? They are going to arrest you . ( voice quavering ) Oh , my God . You taught me how to bend the rules . Bend them , not break them . This isn 't all my fault ! Other people were involved . It 's not just me . Please , Dad , I can 't go to prison . I 'll do anything . Even now ... you don 't know how to act like a man . What do you want me to do ? Kill myself ? I want you to think of someone other than yourself . For you , this is impossible , and it 's my fault . I spoiled you . I raised you , and I failed . My wife , God rest her beautiful soul , raised the one child capable of seeing the only way out of this disaster . ( sighs ) What ? Did you say a way out ? Sun . Sun has a way out ? ( scoffs softly ) Because Father rarely even admits he has a daughter ... because no one knows who I am or what I do at this company , if I confess to your crime , the company may be able to survive the scandal . ( Joong-Ki gasps ) Oh , my God . Sun ... you can save us ? Please , Sun . ( sobs ) Please save me . Please , Sun . Please , save me . Please . ( Joong-Ki sobs ) ( whispers ) Jonas ? - Will . - ( gasps ) The fuck ? We don 't have much time . I tried to contact you . Visiting is not calling or texting someone . It 's not something you make happen . It is something you let happen . It took me quite some time to understand the difference . I 'm hoping it won 't take you as long . You also have to learn the difference between " visiting " and " sharing . " Visiting is what we 're doing now . Sharing is something you can only do inside your cluster , accessing each other 's knowledge , language , skill- - - What 's a cluster ? - You have seven other selves now , but unless you hurry , there 's only going to be six . One of you is about to be destroyed . I told you when we first met , her name is Nomi Marks . She lives in San Francisco . You have to save her , Will , - and in so doing , save yourself . - ( door unlocks ) Wait , wait ! Jonas ! ( whispers ) Jonas . ( female nurse ) OK , this is it . Doctor 's getting ready . ( Nomi ) No . - ( Nomi whimpers , gasping ) - ( man ) Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . - Don 't , please . Please . - ( woman ) It 's OK . - ( man ) Relax . We 're not gonna hurt you . - Please , please , no . - ( man shushing ) - ( panting ) - ( Nomi whispers ) No , no , no . - ( woman ) You are OK . Please don 't do this . Please . Please don 't . Please don 't . Please ! - Please ! - ( man ) Hey , hey , hey , hey . - ( Nomi ) No . - ( man shushing ) - ( man ) It 's OK , it 's OK . ( shushing ) - ( woman ) OK . No . You 're murdering me . ( woman ) Don 't say that . We are helping you . - It 's for your own good , believe me . - ( whimpers ) No . Oh , God ! Oh , God , somebody help me . ( Nomi panting ) - ( screaming ) Somebody help me ! - Who are you ? ( controlled breathing ) ( weakly ) Help me . Fuck ! ( quiet sobbing ) ( low chatter ) ( sniffling ) ( sniffles ) I remember ... what it felt like to be loved by her . It was a long time ago ... but I still remember that feeling . Now we both know ... how it feels to lose it . ( man on recording ) Riley , it 's Dad . God , I hope you get this . I wanted you to be the first to know . Riles , they want me back with the symphony . Said they couldn 't imagine playing Beethoven without me . I know it 's hard for you to come home , but ... Well , you know how much I love you and what it would mean to me to look out past the lights and know you were there , you were listening . OK . I hope you 're OK . Love you , Dad .

 [ liquid bubbling ] [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ ragged breathing ] [ gasps ] [ screams ] [ breathing heavily ] [ voice echoing ] Ulaz ? [ groaning ] [ grunting ] [ ragged breathing ] [ groans ] [ gasps ] [ gasps ] Operation Kuron stage one successful . Begin stage two . [ Shiro screams ] [ breathing heavily ] [ groaning ] [ alarm blaring ] Come on ! Come on ! [ slow electronic beeping ] Notify command headquarters . Operation Kuron stage three is underway . - [ grunting ] - [ alarm blaring ] - [ wind whooshing ] - [ grunting ] [ gasps ] [ metal creaking ] [ grunting ] - [ grunting ] - [ metal creaking ] [ grunts ] [ grunts , sighs ] [ grunts , groans ] [ Haggar ] General Raht ... - I have an assignment for you . - I serve in the name of Galra . I fear Lotor 's focus wavers since his return . I knew there was a risk in bringing him back after such a long absence . And I worry about the path he leads us down . I need you to keep an eye on him . Follow his battle cruiser and report any suspicious behavior to me . Vrepit sa . [ screams ] What killed you ? [ snarling ] [ grunting ] [ snarling ] [ snarling ] [ grunting ] [ screams , grunts ] [ growling ] [ weakly ] Help ! [ snarling ] This must be the one that crashed the pod . Subject Y0XT39 has normal response to optic stimuli . Approved for use in Operation Kuron . - [ male 1 ] Well , what 's he saying ? - I can 't tell , but he 's coming out . [ grunting ] - [ male 2 ] What 's that noise ? - [ male 1 ] Let me check . He wakes . [ male 2 ] Remember to put the clamp on him ? [ male 1 ] Which clamp ? [ male 2 ] The one that keeps his arm from turning into a weapon . - [ male 1 ] The red one ? - It 's the only clamp we have ! Ugh ! Where am I ? Why am I tied up ? I say we eat him . - He doesn 't look Galra . - Does that mean we can 't eat him ? - We 're not going to eat him . - I 'm not Galra . Even worse . He 's a traitor . I 'm not a ... You 're ... You 're rebel fighters . That 's right . We stand against the Galra . We haven 't thrown our lot in with them like you have ! I 'm not working with them . I 'm on your side . My name is Shiro . I 'm a Paladin of Voltron , but I was captured ... I think . - I was fighting Zarkon . - Fighting Zarkon ? [ laughs ] - Right , and I 'm the Phloban of Gargalax . - Please , have you heard of Voltron ? The lions . I need to know ... What happened to them ? How much time has passed ? The Galra have been sending scouts to try and flush us out for years . And now they send you to infiltrate us . Hmm , a joke . - They didn 't send me . I escaped . - [ scoffs ] Escaped a Galra battle cruiser ? [ both laugh ] - I 'm not buying it ! - It 's true . I took a pod . They fired at me . My pod took a hit . They wouldn 't do that if I was friendly . Please , contact the Blade of Marmora or Voltron to verify my identity . And send a signal that can be tracked ? Uh , no . Look around you . Our food and supplies are limited at this outpost . We have no problem watching you starve until you start telling the truth . Prince Lotor , that anomaly is registering on our scanners again . Get the coordinates . I want a visual . There 's nothing . What are you expecting ? I don 't think three strange readings in a day are a coincidence . - We 're being followed ? - We 'd know . Not if they had our scanner protocols . They could counteract our measures . Who would know our protocols other than the Galra ? Bring up heat detectors and set blasters to fire around the anomaly . Around it ? I say we hit it ! I want to know who 's after me . - [ alarm blaring ] - [ yells ] [ Acxa ] It is a Galra fighter . Let 's invite our guest aboard . [ grunts ] No ! [ static ] [ female voice ] Prince Lotor requires your assistance on planet Thayserix . We expect you here immediately . - Thayserix ? Where is that ? - Not far from here . The fleet is passing through our quadrant . Log it on the klygarg . Oh , I hate the klygarg . How do I get on it again ? [ male 2 ] Enter your password . - [ male 1 ] Right . What 's my password ? - I don 't know ! It 's your password ! I 'm intercepting another communication coming in now . - Log this one , too . - [ male 1 ] I haven 't logged the first one ! - [ male 2 ] Shh ! - [ distorted chatter ] [ male voice ] We 've received orders from Prince Lotor . We are to intercept Voltron . [ gasps ] Voltron ? Uh ... See if he 's ready to talk . Huh ? Ah ! Vakala ! Get in here ! I told you we should have eaten him . His leg is hurt . He can 't be far . Let 's split up . I 'll check outside . You check the tunnels . [ growls , grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] [ grunts ] Huh ? [ weapon firing ] - [ firing continues ] - [ yells , groans ] I don 't want to have to hurt you ! Please stand down ! [ groaning ] [ yelling ] You keep missing him ! Let me shoot ! Give me that ! No , it 's mine ! - [ grunts ] - [ whimpers ] - [ grunts ] - [ weapon whirring ] Stop right there ! I 'll shoot ! [ whimpering ] [ whimpers ] [ grunts ] - You 're on the wrong side of this war . - [ groans , gasps ] No , I 'm not . I 'm on your side . My name is Shiro , and like I said before , I 'm a Paladin of Voltron . I know that no matter what I say , you won 't believe me , so ... [ both whimpering ] [ both ] Huh ? Hmm ? I need to get to my team and I need your help . There 's Thayserix . It 's a giant gas planet . According to the communications we intercepted , Voltron is there . Or was . I need to get there . Do you have a ship ? Just a shuttle . It 's designed to dock with low orbiting ships , not travel across the universe . Here . Sorry for hanging you up by your wrists . Thanks . Sorry for hitting you in the face with your friend 's gun . Meh . Wasn 't the first time it happened . Won 't be the last . Shiro , there just doesn 't seem to be any way to get you to Thayserix . What about the Galra cruiser heading there ? What about it ? Well , if it 's passing close enough to this planet , maybe I can hitch a ride . Hitch a ride on a Galra cruiser ? You just escaped from a Galra ship , and now you 're talking about breaking back onto one ? You 're crazier than me . And I volunteered to live on an ice planet for five years . Is it possible or not ? The cruiser is currently within range , but it 's gonna make a jump to hyper-drive any time now . Then I 'd better hurry . Thank you for all your help . Do you really think he 'll be able to get to a fighter and make it to Voltron ? If he 's really who he says he is , then he 's got a chance . You know that was our only ship , right ? [ Vakala ] The battle cruiser 's sensor will identify the shuttle once it gets within range . The single shuttle is such a small object that the bridge won 't be notified . Its defense system is programmed to destroy on sight . [ electronic beeping ] At this point , the sensors will ID you as debris . You must move quickly . Make your way to the blasters . That 's where you 'll get in . These weapons retract just before hyper-drive . [ male voice ] Exiting hyper-drive . Shields up . We 're under attack ! We have a visual on Voltron . Voltron is within range . Voltron ? [ loud rumbling ] Prepare Fighter Squadron One for immediate deployment . Come on . Send the fighters . Let 's go ! Voltron is out of range . Fighters , abort launch . I repeat , abort launch . It 's now or never . Voltron ! Come on , move ! Oh , he 's too fast for me ! No ! [ footsteps approaching ] Stop sending your cronies after me . I know many ideas float through your head , just like your father , but the Galra Empire needs your leadership in these troubling times . I am the leader ! But I am not my father . Pilot log . I am one day out of Thayserix . I 've lost visual and radar contact to Voltron . I 'm continuing course on the same heading . I am four days out from Thayserix . No food or water . SOS ping is active . No signs of anyone . I am seven days out . Oxygen levels are low . And fuel is ... gone . This will be my last entry . - [ electronic beep ] - [ inhales deeply ] [ ragged breathing ] [ inaudible dialogue ] [ inaudible dialogue ] [ roars ] [ grunts ] What 's wrong ? [ gasps ] We found him . [ both blowing ] [ both moan , sigh ]

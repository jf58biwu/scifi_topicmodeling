 Leda will be dismantled for its assets . Sarah and her self-aware sisters won 't get such humane treatment . Alison is Sarah 's twin sister . Your ball hearing 's not gonna be until Monday . - Monday ? ! - Mm-hmm . - Shingles . - Yes . You 'll be first to take the new generation of bot this week . Those shingles will be a thing of the past . A swan ! Stop saying it like that . It was a vision of a swan . What is happening to me ? - This is for my ma . - No , no , no , no ... What if we created a blastocyst ? We 'd need fertilizable Leda eggs . and Castor sperm from Ira . Where are you gonna get the eggs from ? The only problem is we don 't have the resources to do it ... alone . I want to work with Sarah Manning and the others to restore you as the head of Neolution . Are you sure you can work with Sarah ? I look forward to it . I just want you to find a cure . We will . Rachel ? I saw it again . The same man . I think I was on the island . Are you all right ? Yes , I 'm fine . It 's fine . You need to see this . Turn it up . When the refinery shut down , my father lost his job , just like a lot of folks in Tisdale . You had a serious illness , too , didn 't you ? Severe Combined Immunodeficiency . That 's right . We couldn 't move . Instead , it was a steady stream of ... of good-byes . Friends , teachers . That must have been difficult . I got through it . But as you know , Tisdale is still suffering . So when Brightborn decided to build a new research facility , I knew just the place . 260 new jobs . A new walk-in clinic . A new park . She 's painting herself as some kind of hometown hero . Yes , she 's ingenious . I believe Tisdale can rebuild . And here at Brightborn , we just want to be a part of that . All right , so it 's press conference day today . Give me something . What are you gonna say ? It 's just another big step for Brightborn . You 'll just have to wait and see . Could probably give me one thing , just one little ... Just give me one thing . Her government approvals have come through . Then we should act now . That 's them . Are you sure you 're all right ? Scarcely believed it . A Castor who favors slacks . You must be Felix . Hello , Rachel . Thank you for coming , Felix . This is a bad idea . I 'm sure we can all agree that this little diplomatic exchange is rock bottom . Susan gets the brilliant and delightful Cosima , forging ahead to save your lives , while we get you , Rachel , and your half-baked plan to take down Evie Cho . I can assure you , it is not half-baked . Ira , you fertilized my sister 's eggs for science . You don 't get to speak , too . So what does it mean then ? Evie 's got approval for clinical trials of the new bot ? It means implanted gene therapy works . They 'll prove it suppresses certain genetic disorders . Only it 's a Trojan horse . 'Cause they can alter their DNA however they want . Yes . Including germline editing . Changing their clients children 's DNA without consent . She wants to get the technology to the public within three years . Jesus . Evie Cho might be a more cunning villain than you , Rachel . Her villainy is exactly how we get her . Go on . Evie developed her tech with illegal human trials . We 've learned that two carriers recently fled the Brightborn maternity lab . Tabitha Stewart and Kendra Dupree . You want to find them before Evie does . No , we want you to . And with what these girls know , I can destroy Evie . Right . And then Susan Duncan can take her place at the head of Neolution again . Evie is hunting you , Sarah . We both need her gone . I have m-m ... Mm . my limitations , but Ira will help . We do this , it 's with our people , our way . Give me the file . We 'll let you know how it goes . Okay , she 's gone . Oh , no . I 'm sorry . It came for you this morning . " Leave us alone or the whole video goes online . " Like I 'm going to let that happen . They could ruin everything . Why haven 't we found them ? We 're working on it . We traced the e-mail to a fixed address , but the less you know about that the better . And what should I know about Detective Duko ? He disappeared tailing Sarah . Evie , you need to focus on the press conference tonight . Let us handle this . I have jobs for each of you . Honey ! Oh , Donnie , thank God . Oh , my God , it is so good to see you . Oh ! Oh , Donnie , Donnie , please . I just ... I never thought I 'd see you again . - Let 's just go home , okay . - Contain yourself . Adele is coming over to talk about your defense , okay ? Well , she can wait . Daddy needs his conjugal , baby . Donnie , our lives are imploding , and all you can think about is your stiffy ? You 're right , I 'm sorry . You 've been such a rock . How are the kid 's doing in Florida ? Oh , they 're safe . Except for my mother . Yeah ? What about you , how 's the musical ? It 's a fraud . We 're singing " Jesus Christ Superstar , " and I 've completely lost touch with my faith . No , you haven 't . Yes , I have . I 'm Judas , and I can 't even pray anymore . Well , listen ... Oh ! Donnie , oh . Come on . Let 's just go home , all right ? We will let Adele get us out of this first , and then I 'll make you see God , Mrs. Hendrix . Donnie ! Mm-hmm . - Here , hold my undies . - Oh , God . - They 're dirty . - Are they ? Kendra and Tabitha were both full term . Kendra 's got a four-year-old son . All right , you 're a single mum , and you 're desperate enough to surrogate a monster for money ... how far can you run ? Yeah . Tender mercies . Donnie 's out of remand . God . Hendrix is on bail , Cosima 's on the Island of Dr. Moreau , - and Helena is AWOL . - You got a name ? I 'm meant to be bringing us together , and we 're falling apart . Well at least you still got Rachel . Oh , God , yeah . All right , I got to go . I got to go make sure the Hendrixes don 't let my bio-sister into Clone Club . I love you . I know . You , too . You got something ? Maybe . Description matches two women checked into the Centretown Shelter yesterday . One pregnant , the other with a newborn . Good . Now prick the oocyte right in the center to avoid trauma . I don 't want to screw this up . Relax . You 're merely fertilizing Leda with Castor . Good . Now drop some plasma so we know the membrane is ruptured . And drop it back in the center . And we are on our way to compatible stem cells . Thanks to Sarah and Ira 's contributions . You all right ? Yeah . I think the trip up here yesterday took it out of me a little . I will put our egg in a culture . Why don 't you lie down for a bit ? Mm . I have brought you some reading . No way . It 's very rare . " On the Science of Neolution . " P.T. Westmorland . Oh , no . Yeah . Centretown Woman 's Shelter . This doesn 't look good . Shit . No , no , no . You stay right here . You 're not Beth Childs today . All right , fine . I ... I just talked to her . It doesn 't make any sense . She told me to meet her here . No , I 'm hearing you . But you have to let us do our job now . I saw cruisers . What 's going on ? In here . Looks like we have a suicide . So no signs of foul play ? Nah , not that I can see . Forensics is on the way . Though she checked in with a girl named Kendra . But now we can 't find her . - Jesus . - Yeah . Her other friend out there found her hanging from that pipe . No vital signs for her or the baby . Oh , shit . Helena ? Hello , sestra . Hey , w ... we 've been worried about you . Why haven 't you answered your clone phone ? I think ringing is broken . Okay . Where are you ? I have a place of my own now . How is Kira ? She 's getting bigger . How ' bout you ? How are yours ? Yes , much kicking . They 're fighting like us . Yeah ? I 'm happy for you . I 'm glad you 're far away from all this . Why ? Is problem ? No , no . No . Is problem with family Hendrick ? No . Look , it ... it 's nothing for you to worry about . It 's just the usual shit . Oh , I 've got to go . You keep those babies safe , all right ? Say yes . Okay . Okay , bye , meathead . Ah , uh , [ clears throat ] Trina ? Beth ? Why are you dressed like that ? Uh , I 'm undercover . I 'm , uh , plainclothes . What 's wrong ? You were right about Brightborn . It 's way worse than I thought . These wounds look to be defensive . Could be . You seen Marty Duko lately ? No , why ? Guy blew his shift . Nobody knows where he is . No , I haven 't seen him . Hope he 's okay . Tabitha called me as soon as they broke out . Scared shitless . It wasn 't a suicide , no way . I believe you . What , um ... What about Kendra Dupree ? Oh , my God . I hope she got away . Where would she go ? I already told the detective in there . Okay , that 's good , but , uh ... can you tell me ? I feel like I could help . Kendra talked about a ... an empty house somewhere . A friend of her family who died . Something Steinbeck . Clara ? Mary ? - Any idea where ? - I just know that house wouldn 't sell because the town 's economy is so crap . Tisdale ? That would make sense . Kendra 's from there . You got to find her before they do . Yeah . Okay . We will . Detective . I 'm at the scene . The one that got away ... Kendra Dupree ... I got a little tip she 's headed to Tisdale . But you 're not the only ones looking for her . Okay , could be worse . They 've charged you with possession , trafficking , and importing . Importing ? No , no , we weren 't importing . Shh . Uh , what is their evidence ? We won 't know for a couple of weeks . Until then , just comply with your bail conditions and try not to worry . - Okay . - Okay . FYI ... there 's two plainclothes parked outside your house in an unmarked car . We 're under surveillance ? - Mm-hmm . - Is that normal ? We 've already been charged . Seems like Detective Duko has quite a hard-on for y 'all . Well , it 's not him . Why couldn 't it be him ? 'Cause he 's on leave . Okay , how would you know if he 's on leave ? You know what , maybe we should review the scope of - lawyer-client privilege again . - Mm . Okay , is something going on with Detective Duko ? No . - No . - No , I don 't think there is . Great , um , we can continue this conversation at home . Let 's maybe have a drink there . We 'll leave you two . - Bye . - Bye . It 's functioning perfectly , Evie . The therapy is underway . Well , I won 't miss the shingles . Just promise me that you 'll find that carrier , Ian . Or none of it will matter . I promise . What do you know about this place ? Tisdale ? Nothing . I mean , looks rough . I 'm guessing Brightborn offered Kendra money and she thought , how bad can it be ? Pretty bad . So how many more Steinbecks we got left ? Uh , two . And one Steinbock . Rachel , I told you I 'd call you . Yes , an hour ago . Well , we 're still looking for Kendra Dupree . Well , we have new information that could help . Kendra took her four-year-old son , William , to friends in Pickering . I 'll send the address . No , we 've got our own leads out here . Where are you then ? How can we help ? If I need help , I 'll ask . You really don 't like each other , do you ? She put a pencil in my brain . Okay . We have the location of Sarah 's last phone call . She 's in Tisdale . You should go then . Contingency , in case she falters . You 're the sick one . Cosima . You 're the sick one , too , right ? Charlotte ? I don 't feel very sick yet . That 's good . How do you brush your hair ? I don 't . I just wake up , and it looks like this . Want to feel ? I used to have pigtails , too . Do you like the book ? Yeah . But I 'm finding it bit overwhelming right now . I didn 't even know that this guy , P.T. Westmorland , was involved in Neolution . This is my favorite part . This island that we 're on ? It 's made of Precambrian rock , almost 4 billion years old . We 're at this end . You 're right , that is a very cool part . First , your foster sister does a test on us , like she 's got geneticists at her disposal , and then I meet her suburbanite twin sister , the drug dealer ... and her husband gets thrown in jail , and the cops just throw the book at him . Did your family threaten Duko or something ? Adele , you 're making it sound like we 're the mob . What ? So I 'm reading this wrong ? Well , you did just mix mood stabilizers with gin , darling . That 's brunch . Hello , Felix . Hey ! Helena ! Hi ! Adele , Helena . Helena , this is Adele . This is my half-sister . What ? Different mother , same father . So ... you must be Sarah 's other sister ? Yes , same mother ... womb . So it 's triplets now , huh ? Yeah . - Yeah , yeah . - From different regions . - From the same stomach . - Yeah . Countries in there , different countries ? This is ... I should go . That 's probably best . Nonsense . I think you should stay . I have so many questions for you , all starting with where you got that hat . Have you named it yet ? Oh , God , oh , God , oh , God ... Oh , can you use a different word ? Just ... Just call me a bad man . - Oh , you 're a bad man . - I 'm a bad man . Oh , you run it . I run this cellblock . - Yeah , you run it . - Oh , honey , I love you ! Gah ! Oh ! Oh . Donnie , would you pray with me , please ? - Right now ? - Yes , yes . Just close your eyes , close them . Oh , dear Lord ... I know we haven 't been very good Christians lately ... but we are very grateful that Donnie 's out of remand . And we 're trying our best to be good ... To be good . Oh , crap . I can 't do this . Oh , God 's forsaken me . Honey , I 'm ... I 'm sure he gets the point . No , no . Everybody knows we 're criminals . They stare at me in the grocery store . And there are the cops outside of our house , Donnie . We have to get out of here . Honey , we can 't . I forfeited my passport as part of my bail conditions . Well , we 'll ... we 'll go to Niagara . And we 'll pretend it 's a holiday , we 'll send for the kids , and we 'll go hide in one of those water park hotels . The last time we went to splashdown , Oscar got foot-and-mouth disease . Donnie , would you work with me here , please . Yeah . Let 's go to Niagara . Good . All right , this is the last Steinbeck on the list . There 's baby stuff . Just do it quick . Hello ? Kendra ? Kendra Dupree ? Hey . You go away . You hurt my baby . Get away from him . We 're not from Brightborn . We don 't want to hurt your kid . I don 't believe you . Listen very carefully , I 'm a police officer , all right ? I 'm gonna reach into my pocket real slow and show you my ID . There you go . All right , just put down the gun . Move . Okay , okay . Shh , shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh , shh . Oh , shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay . See , Felix neglected to tell me twice that Sarah 's got sisters . And you 're so preggo and foreign . Because it wasn 't pertinent , and I 'm not a gossip . Oh , you 're not a gossip ? [ Scoffs ] Right . Where is Sarah ? She 's good , good , darling , she 's just busy , busy-busy . Alison ? Donnie Hendrick ? Yeah , they 're great , all great . Totally fine . Oh , yeah , they 're doing real well , aside from the fact that they 're currently under federal prosecution . Adele . What , shouldn 't she know ? They are sisters . What does this mean ? Jail ? No , no . Well , maybe Donnie . Yes . I don 't know . Because of Pouchy ? So she knows about the killings ? Tangential , of course , t ... to drugs and missing cops . You have a loud voice . Yes , I do , because , see , my brother here , he 's got more secrets than a Freemason , and I 'm getting real tired of sifting through - all his bullshit . - Just relax . Maybe bullshit is where you belong . Did you just step up to me , little triplet ? - Okay , whoa . - Jesus . No , you don 't want to do that , all right ? It 's okay ? We don 't need to do any of that , all right ? All good . Um , sestra ... you give me an hour here with Adele , and then I promise we are gonna catch up right proper , okay ? You are safe ? Yeah . Hope so . Wow . She was something else . And I don 't think that hat was store-bought neither . You 're going to sober up , and then you 're gonna go . I 'm not leaving without an explanation . Adele , you are so beautifully unsullied by all this shit . And I 'm not gonna be the person that ruins that for you . Okay , okay . Genetics doesn 't really make a family , does it ? - No . - Honesty and ... and , uh , acceptance , that 's what it 's all about , hey ? This is my life . I 'm really sorry . Okay . Hmm . Okay , um , I 'm gonna leave you with your real family for a while . Okay . Okay . How did you find me ? We spoke to Trina . Um , I knew her from before . I was just coming back with lunch . They killed Tabitha , didn 't they ? Well , if they did , they ... made it look like a suicide . We know about Brightborn . You want to tell us what happened ? Shh . It 's okay . Tabitha and I were nearing full term . We heard rumors some of the babies were born ... different . One night , the nurse fell asleep , so we snuck out of the ward . We heard a baby crying , saw two doctors sneak into an operating room ... I 'd snuck this phone in to call my son . Shh , shh , shh , shh . See this dysplasia ? Must be excruciating . Hold her steady . Just a little bee sting , and then you won 't feel anything at all . Okay , she 's gone . The next day , we ran . I named him Jacob . They put this beautiful baby in me , but he was born blind . If they find him , they 'll put him down , too . If you 're willing to come forward with this , we could expose them . We could end all this . Look , you take the video and you leave me out of it . That won 't work , Kendra . Without you , the video can be discounted . Look what they did to Tabitha . I have another son . They 'll hurt us , I know they will . Hi . So ? What do you think of Neolution 's forefather ? I think he 's fascinating for a racist blowhard who thinks that poverty is genetic . Consider the era , the Victorian mind-set . Is your mind-set so different ? Our ethics debate again . Well , I just met a little girl with a deformed leg and a terminal illness . When I created Charlotte , I was under tremendous pressure to continue Leda . I didn 't have Kendall 's replicating cell line . I don 't understand . What pressure ? It doesn 't matter . She is a life . She 's unique . She 's ... She 's happy . And , hopefully , we will cure her . The cumulus cells are ... are starting to strip off the ... the egg . That 's excellent news . Tomorrow we should have a zygote . Of course she 's reluctant to come forward . You have to convince her , Sarah . I 'm trying , but it 's not our decision , is it ? - It 's hers . - Listen to me . If you found her , Brightborn is right behind . Tell her we 'll protect her . What if we can 't ? I 'm not lying to her . Then let me . Or use the information I gave you about her other son . I 'm not blackmailing her , Rachel . Sarah , don 't be naive . We have one chance at ... Still here . Sarah won 't act . We need that contingency plan . All right , but there 's a complication . He 's sleeping . All right . We 're not safe here . We need , uh , we need you to come with us . Like protective custody ? Honestly , there are police that we can 't trust . But we 've got a safe house , and it 's very well protected . This is crazy . I don 't even know you people . Brightborn is after us , too . And we both have daughters , and we put them first everyday , just like you 're doing with Jacob . But we need you to help us end this . Could you go get him , please ? Okay . Shh , shh , shh , quiet . They 're outside . Kendra ! Let her go , let her go . She 'll keep him quiet . Whose phone is that ? Landline . Whoa . Shit . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh , shh , shh . Hello ? Kendra Dupree ? Listen to me carefully . I have an associate waiting for you in a car outside . I know Sarah is there . I also know your son William is with Carrie Munroe , 14 Emerson Drive , Pickering . If you do as I say , he won 't be hurt . Shh , shh . Shh . Don 't move . Police ! Drop your weapons nice and slow . Kick ' em over to me . Get on your knees . Put your hands behind your heads . Lock your fingers . You again ? Where 's your usual partner ? Why ? You miss him ? You go get Kendra , I 'll take care of these guys . Kendra ? ! Ira , Stop ! Kendra ! What happened ? She 's gone with Ira . Rachel 's screwing us . I 'm so stupid . Hey , did you kill that woman at the shelter ? ! - No , no , no , hey ! - Eh ? ! Eh ? ! We 're not doing this . We 're gonna drop ' em off at the precinct . We 'll be out by morning . Yeah ? I 'm gonna be real interested to see who springs you . Swimsuits ... a hair dryer , and earplugs for your snoring . Uh , I grabbed some Imodium in case you want that crab salad again . - Hey , the cops are gone . - Oh . There 's just an ambulance parked there now . Good , good time to skedaddle . Yep , let 's get out of here . Wait ... flip-flops . Uh , basement , basement . Right , okay , okay . Go , go . Donnie . Donnie ? Donnie . Oh , Lord ! Sorry to barge in . We 're gonna have a little chat . Okay . Large-scale clinical trials are just the beginning . Soon , Brightborn will offer advanced gene therapy directly to you and your families . I can think of no better place to begin this genetic revolution than in my hometown of Tisdale . Thank you . Okay , I 'm ready . - What is it ? - Rachel Duncan is here . - In the city ? - Downstairs . She says she has information about Kendra Dupree . You 're the tough one in the family , aren 't you ? I guess you 'd have to be . This one 's first generation . It 's glitchy as hell . Messed up a lot of people . I need you to tell me what Sarah got up to with Detective Duko . He disappeared tracking her . By the time I count to 10 , you 're going to answer , or this goes in . I love you , Donnie . One , two ... Lord , please , hear my prayer . - three , four ... - I 've sinned and sinned . - five , six ... - I 've turned my back on my community . - seven ... - I 've lost my way . - eight , nine ... - Please , forgive my husband ... - ten . - ... protect my children , and have mercy on ... Helena , wh-where did you come from ? Beavertail National Park . It was very peaceful . Helena ! Donnie Hendrick ... Mm . you look like roast pig . Hey , what the hell are you up to ? Where 's Kendra ? She and her baby are safe . Did you threaten to hurt her kid , eh ? You 're worse then bloody Brightborn , mate . We 're just doing what needs to be done , what you would not . Where 's Rachel ? She 's meeting with Evie . You let her do that ? - It 's not what you think . - You 're stupid , mate . She is playing you . Rachel just wants power . She 'll cut us all down , including you . You 're supposed to be on the island . Well , I 'm here . And lucky for you , I have your solution . You know where my carrier is ? She 's in my custody . Along with her video . It 's abhorrent . I 'm surprised you left yourself so vulnerable . So this is a shakedown . I prefer to think of it as a negotiation . Project Leda is obsolete . Off the table . Fine . Same with Susan . Agreed . Her day has past . Don 't tell me you want Sarah and her sisters spared . You don 't know me at all , do you ? Well , then what ? I take great offense to something you said to me once ... that Neolution would never allow a clone a position of power . Today , that changes . You want a seat at the table . And in return , I give you Kendra and her video . And no one need know about engineered birth defects and euthanized newborns . The video 's on there ? Yes , there are no copies . And what about Kendra Dupree ? She 's in my hotel room . And the child is with her ? Yes , that 's right . Do we have a deal ? Like I have a choice . One question . Why euthanasia ? Surely , with Brightborn 's resources ... - You 're recording this ? - ... hidden away ... And ready to upload it to every major news network . Let them live out their shortened lives . If even one of these children were discovered , decades of science would have been shelved . At the end of the day , euthanizing severely deformed newborns was the most humane way forward . Now , if you 'll excuse me . Wow , she did it . Well done . Welcome . What if I were to tell you that , in a few short years , immune deficiencies could be eradicated , cancer cured ? Blood disease , hemophilia , hereditary blindness all in our past ? Sound farfetched ? Not to me . Because here at Brightborn Technologies ... At the end of the day , euthanizing - severely deformed newborns ... - we are on the cusp of a genetic revolution . ... was the most humane way forward . Today we are pleased to announce federal approval of phase three clinical trials ... Hold her steady . of implantable bioengineered gene therapy . the most humane way forward . Okay . researching and marketing gene therapies ... She 's gone . Excuse me . Are babies being euthanized at Brightborn 's birthing facility ? large-scale double-blind studies . Do Brightborn treatments cause deformation ? - What are you talking about ? - Well , we have video of you admitting to euthanizing Brightborn babies . How do you respond ? Can you confirm these are Brightborn doctors ? Thank you . No comment . No further questions . Excuse me . Ms. Cho ! Please . Baseless allegations . No further comment . Rachel ? Is it happening again ? What did you see ? It isn 't a glitch . It 's the island . There were people there . The swan 's trying to show me something , Ira .

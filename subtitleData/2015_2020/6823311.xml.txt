 Previously on " Aftermath " ... Time and space . It 's not all that it 's cracked up to be . Yesterday , my friend Kimmy started raving . And ... I killed her . Your husband was in Seattle when everyone disappeared . - Yes . - And he came back . The one is many , but the many are one . We have to find him . He understands how to survive . Well , here 's your Moondog weather update . Scattered showers of lunar debris throughout today , followed by a heavy downpour of death , with flaming chunks the size of Nantucket by tomorrow . The long-range forecast ? There isn 't one . - What 's wrong ? - You don 't want to hear it . Yeah , I do . Yeah , but I don 't , so I win . You know , I saved your life . And you risked yours to save my dad 's . I 'd say we 're connected . I know we 're connected . I 've been hoping for someone like you all my life , but I tried to die yesterday , and I will definitely die tomorrow , according to the guy on the radio . No . [ sighs ] You don 't know that you 're gonna die . I wouldn 't mind dying if I hadn 't screwed up , but I screwed up completely . No , you didn 't . Did you see those people yesterday ? They were my only friends for years . And I was just like them ... Selfish and horny and high . You know , two of those things aren 't that bad . I don 't regret the horny . But the high was stupid , and selfish was wrong . And that was my life . And now it 's over . I have thought that 15 times this month , and , so far , nothing 's happened . You only have one life . You get this little bit of light , this little break from nothingness , and I did nothing with it . And now everything that 's coming is cold and black . There 's no ... there 's no music . No feeling . No people . No love . You know , the world 's huge . No one said those moon rocks are gonna even land anywhere near us . [ explosion booms ] God damn it . Those are close .

Barry disappeared in Seattle , along with everyone else . You 've ... you 've heard that , I 'm guessing . We 're aware of the Seattle event , yes . Then he was back in bed . Two nights ago . Didn 't even hear him come in . Did he say what happened in Seattle ? - Where everyone went ? - He didn 't know . He was raving about a white light and being up somewhere ... Nowhere . It didn 't make any sense . And then it happened to him again . Just this white swirling in the sky , and then he was gone . What was that thing ? It 's undetermined , ma 'am . Someone else who disappeared in Seattle turned up in our town , same night as Barry . That thing got her , but not before she saved a man , a man who had plague . She said he knew something important about everything that 's happened . What was his name ? Don 't know . They spoke in a kind of code , " the one and the many " or something . " The one is many , but the many are one " ? Moondog Black said that on the air last night . They 're all connected somehow . Where did the plague man go ? His family took him in a big old RV . Toward east , to 84 . Yeah . Thank you , ma 'am . Canary in a coal mine . What 's that ? It 's something that 's supposed to warn you about bad things . The bird dies before you do . Oh , Doc Simmons talked to him , the RV man . Simmons and his gunmen were going to kill him because he had plague . And ... where would we find Doc Simmons ? [ dramatic music ] Everyone all right ?

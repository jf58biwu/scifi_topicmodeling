 [ various explosions ] - What just happened ? - Who cares ? Wormhole ! [ yelling ] Coran , what 's happening ? The integrity of the wormhole has been compromised . - It 's breaking down ! - What does that mean ? It means we have no control over where we 're headed ! [ all grunting , screaming ] [ Lance ] Keith ! Shiro ! [ screaming continues ] They 've vanished through the temporal rift ! The lions are gone ! - [ groaning ] - [ alarm blaring ] - [ alarm blaring ] - Come on , come on , come on ! [ grunting ] [ groans , coughs ] [ sighs ] You okay , Red ? Okay . We 'll fix you up . We had a tough battle . Where are we ? Where have we landed ? [ gasps ] Shiro . Shiro ! - [ alarm blaring ] - Whoa ! [ screaming ] [ groans ] Huh ? What 's the matter , girl ? Okay , rest a bit . I 'll see what I can do . Looks like there 's no gravity here . It 's like a trash nebula of some kind . Okay , Pidge , stay calm . You know what they say . " When you get lost in space , the best thing to do is stay put and wait for people to find you . " This 'll be nice . I 'll have some " me " time . No one to annoy me . Let 's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us . Coran , look ! There appears to be something on the other end . - We 're heading right toward it ! - Scanners show that there 's no exit . It 's just nothingness . Find an exit before we run smack into the void ! I can 't . I 've lost control of the Castle . Brace yourself ! We 're about to hit it ! Let 's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us . - Coran , we 're okay ! - What are you talking about ? We 've lost all the lions ! We 've just smashed into a black void . Don 't you remember ? Hmm ? [ gasps ] What happened to the mice ? They 've transformed . [ all squeaking ] - [ gasps ] Coran ? - Why are you looking at me like that ? Do I have a boogie stuck in my mustache again ? No . You look younger . [ grunts ] Scanners show that there 's no exit . It 's just nothingness ! You said that already ! Find an exit before we run smack into the void ! I 'm entering coordinates to get us out of here . The Castle won 't accept an end point . - Just enter any coordinates ! - I tried , but the system is locked . I can 't get a signal out or receive a signal in . [ gasps ] Allura ! Let 's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us . Oh , no ! You 're even younger now ! What 's the matter ? You look confused . Don 't worry , Princess , I 'll get us out of here . - [ sighs ] - [ growls ] [ screams ] We appear to be in some sort of time loop that 's affecting everyone but me . Scanners show that there 's no exit . It 's just ... Nothingness , I know . And we can 't find another exit point . Don 't just stand there . We 've got to find a way . I 'll never give in to nothingness ! [ groans ] [ static ] Keith , are you there ? Keith ? I 've got to get to higher ground . [ panting ] Shiro , can you hear me ? Shiro ? [ static ] Shiro , are you there ? [ groaning , panting ] [ breaking up ] Shiro , are you there ? Answer me ! Keith . I 'm here . Keith . - [ groaning ] - Shiro , it 's Keith . Keith . Keith , I 'm here . I 'm okay . [ chuckles ] Shiro , you made it . It takes more than a glowing alien wound , a fall from the upper atmosphere , and crashing into a hard pan surface , at what I 'm guessing is about 25 meters per second squared , to get rid of me . - How are you ? - Not good . My lion 's busted . Wait , what wound ? It 's nothing . [ screaming ] [ groaning ] Hang on , I 'm coming . [ growling , snarling ] On second thought , you 'd better hurry . [ yelps ] Who 's there ? [ creatures chattering , squeaking ] Hmm ? Aw ! Hey , little guys ! Aw , you guys are so cute . Too cute to be found in a dump like this . Are you guys the only ones living here ? I hope my rough landing didn 't disturb your day . I 'll only be here for a short time . I 'm waiting for my friends to find me . We were separated during a wormhole jump . [ squeaking , chattering ] Yeah , friends ! I sure hope they find me soon . [ indifferently ] Let 's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us . [ sighs ] This is so boring . Coran , please ! I don 't need any of your attitude right now . You don 't understand me at all ! You have no idea what I 'm going through ! I 'll be in my control area ! Hmmph ! I can 't manually enter coordinates . But the Castle will automatically lock on to the lions ' whereabouts , if we can locate them . It 's not working ! I 'm unable to hone in on their location . [ loud operatic music playing ] Coran , turn that down ! Our lives are at stake ! I can only express myself through music ! Coran , if you don 't turn that down , I swear I 'll turn this Castle around and- - And what ? We 're just gonna run into this void that 's coming up here . I hate everybody ! Let 's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us , whatever that means . We 've tried everything and nothing 's worked . A few more trips down this wormhole and you 're going to disappear . - We must find a way out . - Just blast your way out ! Duh ! I suppose it 's worth a try . The Castle defenses might have enough firepower to destroy the tunnel . Yeah ! And it 'll go ker-plooey ! [ Allura ] It 's not working ! It 's like we 're shooting at ourselves . [ Coran blows raspberry ] Where 's Voltron ? - Shiro , what happened ? - There 's several creatures . [ grunts ] Huh ? [ snarling ] [ roars ] Uh-oh . [ screams ] [ grunting ] [ snarling ] [ yells ] [ groaning ] [ groaning ] Keith , are you okay ? What happened ? [ grunting ] Minor delay , but I 'm on my way . How are you ? I 'm all right , but I 'm trapped in a cave , and some nasty-looking creatures have me cornered . Stay put . I 'm on my way . I just have to ... figure this out . " My name is Keith . I 'm so emo . " " Shiro , you 're our leader . What should we do ? " " We 'll get through this if we work together . We 're a team . " " Look at me ! I 'm Lance . Hey , is that a cute girl over there ? " " I don 't feel good . The smell of this place makes me want to barf . " " Paladins , please . We must defeat Zarkon . " " Blah , blah , blah ! Crazy words . Mustache . " - Huh ? - [ creatures squeaking ] What is it ? Hey , you 're working again ! Welcome back ! [ screaming ] [ groans ] [ chattering , squeaking ] No , it 's not my friends . It 's just an old , rusty satellite . [ gasps ] Hey ! Maybe I can find my friends before they find me . [ sighs ] Patience yields focus . That really stayed with you , didn 't it ? You 've given me some good advice . If it wasn 't for you , my life would have been a lot different . Yeah . You wouldn 't have crashed a flying lion on an alien planet and be stuck with little hope of rescue . So , you 're welcome . [ coughing ] Stay with me , Shiro . [ grunts ] [ chuckling ] [ whimpering ] [ screaming ] [ whimpering , groaning ] Keith ! Keith ! Hang on . I 'm on my way . Good , because these guys just started digging . [ gasps ] [ chuckling ] Shiro , I have a visual on the Black Lion . [ growling ] - [ roars ] - [ screams ] [ screaming continues ] [ groaning ] [ growling , snarling ] [ groans ] [ screaming , groaning ] [ groaning ] Shiro , what happened ? Let 's check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this worm goes . - [ stomach grumbling ] - I hungry . [ screaming ] Coran , no ! That is not a toy . You 're going to break the Castle and everything will stop ! Wait a second . Perhaps we can simply stop the Castle from moving . No ! Mine ! - [ growls ] - [ screams ] [ powering down ] I 've shut down all the power . Why are we still moving towards the void ? [ crying ] My control panel ! - [ cooing , crying ] - I know , I know . Who wants to check the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor to see where this wormhole is taking us ? - You do , that 's who . - [ cooing ] We have to get out of this loop before the only thing left of you is your mustache . [ spits ] Poopies . [ groans ] [ grunts ] I know I 'm not Shiro , but he 's in trouble . We need to help him . [ yells ] [ groaning ] [ snarling ] - [ gasps ] - [ roars ] [ grunting ] [ roars ] [ groans , gasps ] [ roars ] That ought to do it . Now , let 's see if we can get a hold of the Castle . No , no ! What 's wrong ? I need to get out of here ! I need to find my friends ! Come on ! [ roars ] [ growling ] Thanks . Now , let 's see if this thing works . [ grunts ] I hope the signal 's strong enough to reach the Castle . Coran , what are we going to do ? If we hit the end of the tunnel again , you 'll cease to exist . [ gasps ] I 'm sorry . You were like a second father to me . - [ electronic beeping ] - [ gasps ] Coran , look ! The Castle has locked onto a coordinate . Come on . Come on ! We made it ! - [ snoring ] - [ groans ] Mm ? Mom ? [ screams , groans ] [ chuckles ] You saved us , Pidge . We were stuck in a time loop . You got us out with this giant trash pile . It 's a make-shift communications link that sends out the Green Lion energy . It 's similar to the energy that guided the Blue Lion home . Pidge , you 're a genius ! I know . Besides , it wasn 't just me . They helped . [ chattering , squeaking ] - Hmm ... - Let 's go get the rest of the paladins . [ Shiro ] Thanks for saving me . You 'd have done the same for me . How 's your wound ? My wound 's great . It 's getting bigger all the time . Just trying to lighten the mood . Hang in there . When Allura and Coran find us , they 'll fix you right up . Keith , if I don 't make it out of here ... I want you to lead Voltron . Stop talking like that . You 're gonna make it . Huh ? [ Zarkon ] Explain to me how you let Voltron escape . [ Prorok ] Perhaps it was a mechanical failure , sire . Haggar boosted the solar barrier 's power beyond its normal limits . This was no mechanical failure . The two sentries that were guarding the barrier control were found destroyed . This was clearly sabotage . Lord Zarkon , I will start an investigation immediately . I will not rest until the perpetrators are captured . Perhaps I can save months of investigating . Who has been trying to chisel Voltron away from me this entire time ? Who sent his fleet out without my orders to get Voltron ? Sire , no ! I-I would never do that . - [ Zarkon ] Get rid of him . - No ! I 'm innocent ! Before we dispose of him , the druids will find out all that he knows . Then , he will receive a punishment worse than death . Lieutenant Thace ... You are now in charge of the investigation ... Commander . Vrepit sa .
